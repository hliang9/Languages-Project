ROBERT MUIRHEADS. LAMENT. To a Plesant New Tune. 1 Leave of my minde why thinks thou on, She that was once my dear does thou not know that she is gone, and maried now I hear what madness make the recolect to think on such a maide who allwise payd me with neglect and my desinges bewraed. 2 Why wakenest thou again my woes and thus tormenteth me, who is the worst of all my foes who only friend should be, is she not dead to me alace except her husband dye, Ile yet remember on her face for all her Creultie. 3 For I never saw a thing so faire since I had eyes to see, a thing that was both Chast and raire thing that reavisht me, modestie she did exceed, most of women kind, thought she had no fault Indeed gift she had been mine. 4 I wet in my conceit I swear, and Constantce to the whilest o man Could withstand her feat, nor shoon her destanie, I Loved her well she lov'd not me she was un great yow'l say, some said it was but pee O what great fools were they 5 For I tryed all the civil arts, that ever any used, with tears I did procleam my smart, yet daylie was abused, I am sure if ever she had Lov'd, at length she would have shown'd she slighted me and so she provd, And manfullie disound. 6 Unhappie I if I recall, these pevis thoughts again to bring my spirit under thral to reposes my pain, If I had never seen her face I had not fainted so, to offer up a sacrifice, to anie thing below. FINIS.
