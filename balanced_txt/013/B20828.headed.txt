THE SPEECH Of the RECORDER of Oxford, to His Majesties at his Entrance into that City. ost Gracious Sovereign; I Have Read in the Roman History that Marius was wont to say, That he that durst speak to Caesar, was ignorant of his Greatness; And he that durst not speak to him, was Ignorant of his Goodness: Of the latter whereof we and all your People have had so large Experience, that I am emboldened to beg the stay of the Wheels of your Chariot for some few minutes, and that I may find so much favour in the sight of my Lord the King, as to speak a few Words in the Name of the Loyal Citizens of this place, which is but to let Your Majesty understand the infinite Joy and Gladness, wherewith their Hearts are filled, in beholding the Royal Pre∣sence of Your Self, and our most gracious Queen in this place; I say, to behold You after so ma∣ny Wicked Designs of Bloody and Unreaso∣nable men against Your Royal Person; and the many and singular Deliverances of You from them, (for which the Name of God be praised) here at this time in the heart of Your Dominions Reigning in Glory and Safty is a Joy so unspea∣kable to all true English Hearts, That if I had an hundred Tongues I could not be able to express it. And that you should at this time make this Ci∣ty the Royal Chamber and place of the Recep∣tion
of Your Parliament, is a Grace and Favor ever by us to be Recorded in the Register of Time and Fame. And we hope that it may prove as auspicious to Your Majesty for that purpose as any other place whatsoever, notwithstanding any furmises that have been made to the contrary, since there has been Famous and Good Parliaments held here, as might be proved by our Ancient Re∣cords and Histories if there were time to do it. But Great Sir, we must not presume to be too te∣dious in so great a Presence, especially after your long and tedious Progress this day, and there∣fore I shall presume to say little more, but for all the good you have done us, what can we render to you again? Aristotle saith, we can never ren∣der equal things to God and our Parents; You are the Blessed Father of our Country, and under the shadow of Your Royal Protection, we do in∣joy all our Rights, both Religious and Civil, and confess that our Obligations are greater than our Acknowledgments can be; Yet such as they are we beseech your Gracious acceptance of them: we have also one Present more to make to Your Maty, which is our Prayers devoted to Your Service, and we prostrate all the Ensigns of Authority which we hold under You at Your feet, and shall become daily Votaries to Heaven, That our Gracious Sovereign Lord, King Charles the Second may long and happily Reign over us, and may always be a Terror to his Foes, and to all his Good and Loyal People a Tow∣er of Defence, and let all Good People say AMEN.
