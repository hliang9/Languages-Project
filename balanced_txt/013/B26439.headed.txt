Heathens: We Command yee to Greet the Emperor Leopold, in Case he desire it, and you are a Friend to our Majesty whose Power and Will we have extended very farr: you have for some time past acted to our prejudice, and violated our Friendship; tho' We have not offended you either by War or otherwise, yet you have taken secret advice with other Kings, and your Councils how to shake off your Yoak; in which you have pro∣ceeded very indiscreetly; and thereby you have exposed your people to fear and danger, who have nothing to expect now but Death, which you have brought upon your selves; for I declare I will make my self your Master, & pursue you from the East to the West, and extend my Majesty to the End of the Earth: in the procedure of all which you shall find my Power exerted to your extream prejudice, & shall feel the dreadfull effects of my Wrath; and since you have put your hope in the strength of some Towns and Castles, I have given Command to overthrow them, and trample under my Horses feet all that is delightful to you leaving no roome hereafter to make friendship with me, or suffer you any fortified place to remain to put yotr trust in; for I have resolved forthwith to destroy you and your people, and to dispoyle you of the German Empire after my Will, Leaving in the Empire a remembrance of my dreadfull Sword, that it may publickly ap∣pear that I will establish my Religion therein, and pursue your Cru∣cified God: whose Wrath I fear not, nor his Coming to defend, or deliver you out of my hands; but will condemn your Sacred Priests to the Plough, and suffer the Breasts of your wives to be suckt by dogs and Beasts; you will do well to forsake your Re∣ligion, otherwise I will give Order to Consume you with Fire: this is enough to let you understand my Will; if you will be so wise as to know it.
