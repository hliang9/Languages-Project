DANGEROUS ERRORS IN Several late printed BIBLES To the great scandal, and cor∣ruption of sound and true Re∣ligion. Discovered by WILLIAM KILBURNE Gent. Ex parvâ scintillâ magnum incendium. Principiis obsta, serò medicina paratur, Cùm mala per longas invaluere moras, Printed at Finsbury Anno 1659
An Animadversion to all good Christians of this Common-wealth, discovering (amongst many Thousands of others) some pernicious, erroneous, and corrupt Erratas, Escapes, and Faults in seve∣rall Impressions of the Holy-Bible and Testa∣ment, within these late years, commonly vended and dispersed to the great scandal of Religion, but more particularly in the Impressions of Henry Hills, and John Field Printers; To the intent that either in reading of any such already bought, or buying the like hereafter, they may be well advi∣sed, for the good of their own Souls, and the Ge∣nerations that shall succeed. Published by William Kilburne Gent. (Honorable and elect Christians) THe sacred Scriptures are the Crystalline Fountaine, from whence all the lucid streams, and Rivulets of pure Religion are derived and conducted into the Cisterns and Receptacles of the hearts and understandings of Christians; whereby they may be directed, and instructed to lead a gracious and holy life here, and prepared for, and assured of a glorious and eternal life hereafter: And what accurate diligence and venerable respect the antient Jews did use, and bear toward the Pentateuch, and other Divine Books of Canonical Scripture, of the old Te∣stament, in accounting the number of words, Syl∣lables
nay Letters thereof: And also the seduli∣ty of Christians since the death of Christ, (through all the terrible and sanguineous persecutions of cruel Tyrants,) to convey from age to age the Testament of our blessed Saviour, and Writings and Epistles of his Holy Apostles in their purity, (whereby they have been by Gods providence preserved from corruption,) should incite, and invite us, (who have received a greater Illumi∣nation, and Revelation, than the Iews, or Pri∣mitive Christians,) carefully to promulge and propagate the word of God in its intrinsecal virtue, and propriety; Considering the many Heresies and false Doctrines professed in our dayes; And that it was the Arch-policy and designe of the Devil in tempting our very Saviour (as Math. 4.6. and Luke 4.10, 11. compared with Psal. 91.11, 12) to pervert, and falsly produce the authority and Parallel of the Scripture: And when as also in the Primitive times one  (the least Letter of the Alphabet) occasioned so great a controversie in Gods Church, under the Empire of Constantine the Great. For in the Doctrine of the ever-bles∣sed Trinity, in the debates of the Nicene-Councel, Athanasius, and the Orthodox party held, that Christ was , and of the same, Essence of God his Father; the Arians, and Heterodox, , making him a meer Creature, and depriving him of his royall Diadem of the eternall Divinity; Which two words differ but in one Letter. And we read Iudges 12.6. that the Gile∣adites slew of the Ephraimites 42000 souls, for
not pronouncing rightly Shibboleth, and missing but in one Aspiration. You may well remember that the zeal & care of the late Bishops (especially of reverend and learned Doctor Usher) was such, that for the omission in one impression of the Common-prayer of the Negative word [Not] in the seventh Commandement, the Printer was fined 2000. or 3000l. in the late Kings time, as I have heard, which hapned long before the late wars began: In which time through the absence of the Kings Printers, and cessation of Bi∣ble-Printing at London, many erroneons English Bibles were printed in, and imported from Holland; which, being diligently compared by the late Assem∣bly of Divines, were reported to the Parliament in 1643. to be corrupt, & dangerous to Religion; exhi∣biting to them these three faults only; for which the impression was suppressed and condemned to the fire, and a Prohibition made against the Impor∣tation of any English Bibles for the future. viz. Gen. 36.24. This is that Ana that found Rulers in the wilderness — for Mules. Ruth 4.13. The Lord gave her Corruption — for Conception. Luke. 21.28. Look up, and lift up your heads, for your Condemnation draweth nigh. — for Redemp∣tion. This Affair also occasioned the said Assembly by direction of the Parliament (as is very well known to Mr. Philip Nye, &c.) to propose the Bible printing to several Stationers of London; who re∣fusing that laudable work, the same was commend∣ed
to Mr. William Bentley Printer in Finsbury, and his partners, who have so exactly, and commen∣dably imprinted several volumes by Authority of Parliament in 8o. and 12. in the years 1646 48.51, &c. (according to the Authentique corrected Cam∣bridge Bible, revised Mandato Regio, by the learn∣ed Doctor Ward, Doctor Goad of Hadley, Mr. Boyse, Mr Mead, &c. and printed by the elabo∣rate industry of Thomas Buck Esquire, and Mr. Roger Daniel, in folio in 1638.) that some small remainders of them yet unsold, are now daily expo∣sed at 12s. per Book in quires unbound by the Stationers (for the fairness of the Print, and truth of the Editions,) which Mr. Bentley afforded here∣tofore at 2s. per Book, or thereabouts; untill he hath been unjustly obstructed by Mr. Hills and Mr. Field, who have endeavoured, by abusing the Au∣thority of the State, to Monopolize the sole print∣ing of Bibles to themselves, since the latter end of the year 1655. and have raised the prices to ex∣cessive dear rates, to the very great scandal of Re∣ligion, and detriment of the Common-wealth; For as much as they have printed and dispersed in these late years divers Editions in severall vo∣lumes under their several Names and Titles, that if you be pleased to compare and examine the same, you will find amongst many great numbers of others, verbal, literal, and in the points of di∣stinction, these grosse and notorious Erratas, Es∣capes, and Faults following; Which I recommend to your ingenuous consideration and benevolent construction, having heretofore represented some
of them to his late Highnesse, and the most of them to the late Parliament. 1. In a Pearl-Bible printed by John Field at London in 1653. in volume 24, (very small to car∣ry in pockets) whereof there have been near 20000 dispersed, are these egregious faults, viz. All the Dedications and Titles of David's Psalms are wholly left out, being part of the ori∣ginal Text in Hebrew, and intimating the cause, and occasion of the writing and composing those Psalms, whereby the matter may be better illu∣strated. John 9.21. Or who hath opened his eyes we know not. These words are wholly omitted. Rom. 6.13. Neither yield ye your members as instruments of Righteousness unto sinne. for unrigh∣teousness. 1 Cor. 6.9. Know ye not that the unrighteous shall inherit the Kingdome of God? for shall not inherit? This is the foundation of a damnable Doctrine: for it hath been averred by a reverend Doctor of Divinity to several worthy persons, that many Libertines and licentious people did produce, and urge this Text from the authority of this corrupt Bible against his mild Reproofs, in justification of their vicious and inordinate Conversations. 2. In a small Bible in volume 12. printed by John Field at London in 1655. whereof great num∣bers have been dispersed. A Catalogue of 91 notorious faults, amongst many others therein, were presented by Mr. Hills to Mr. Secretary of Estate, and by him recommend∣ed
to an honorable Member of the late Parliament. One whereof is 2 Cor. 13.6. But I trust that ye shall know that we are not Reprobates. which verse is wholly omitted. 3. In another Bible in volume 12. printed also by John Field at London in 1655. whereof great numbers have been dispersed. Upon my reading of the six first Chapters only in St. Matthew, I found 10. notable faults, and have received general information from persons of worth, that the residue of the Book is correspon∣dent; which was evidenced to a Committee of Par∣liament, in so much that they seized them, and prohibited the sale thereof, and of the former Bi∣bles in Mr. Fields hands as also of the ensuing Bible, which notwithstanding that restraint, he hath since divulged 4. In a Bible in volume 12. printed by John Field at London in 1656. you may observe these faults, viz. Isai. 10.26. Cap. 13.3. Cap. 14.24. Cap. 17.8. Cap. 28.17. And the waters shall overthrow the hiding place. for overflow. Cap. 48.19. Cap. 49.22. and so generally through the whole old Te∣stament. But in the new Testament be pleased to peruse these, viz. Luk. 23.42, 51. Cap, 24.24. Joh. 1.51. Cap. 2.9, 10. Cap. 3.21. Cap. 5.2. The pool Bethsaida. for Bethesda. ver. 23. As they honour their Father. for the Father Emphatically. Cap. 6.29, 33. Cap. 7.39. But this spake he of the Spirits, which they that believe on him should receive, for Spirit,
speaking onely of the Holy Ghost, as appeareth in the same verse. Cap. 13.22. Cap. 14.13, 21. And he that loveth me, shall loved. for shall be loved of my Father. Cap. 15.17. These things I commanded, for command you. Cap. 17.12. That the Scriptures might be fulfilled. for Scripture, speaking of Iudas the sonne of perdition, and re∣ferring to Psal. 109.8. Cap. 19.37. Cap. 20.25. And put my fingers, for finger. Cap. 21.17. Act. 1.7. Cap. 4.15. Counsel (or advice,) for Councell (or a consistorie.) And this is often reiterated in other places. Cap. 8.36. A very base omission, and false justification of the words to the confusion of the sense. Cap. 13.1, 6, 26. he, for they, a grosse fault. Rom. 4.10. Cap. 6.23. meer nonsense. 1 Ioh. 4.20. 2 Ioh. ver. 1. Rev. 1.1. Cap. 21.10. I might particularize many more, especially in the Contents; which generally are falsly perverted, and mutilated to the great impediment, and ob∣struction of the right understanding of the scope and Text of the Chapters. 5. In another Minion-Bible in 8o volume, print∣ed by Iohn Field at Cambridge in 1657. which fels very much, and very dear, at least for 8 s. 6 d. per book. Psal. 143.4. Therefore is my Spirit over, is wholly omitted in many of them that I have seen. And there are many other faults, as I am well informed, of very great notoriety. 6. In a Bible in 120. volume, printed at London by Hen. Hills and I. Field, in An. 1656, corrected
by one Mr. Robinson (a Scotch Rabbi,) and publish∣ed in an Advertisement by Mercurius Politicus 6. Nov. 1656. to be incomparable. And in truth I think he was not deceived, (though indeed he a∣bused the Common-wealth;) For I am confi∣dent, if the number of the Impression was as (I am informed) 20000 there are as many faults therein, verbal, literal, and in the difference of the Italique words, (to the great corruption of the Text,) and in false points of distinction: so that besides the base paper, and printing, and abridgement, and perversion of the Contents, and transposing and confounding of words, whereby it is very trouble∣some to be read, it is the worst of all the rest that are exposed to your view; as appeared palpably to the Parliament, whereby the sale thereof, (se∣dente Parliamento) was inhibited, but since dispers∣ed very much at Countrey Fairs, and Markets by Book-binders and petty Chapmen, being no fit∣ting Book for sale by Stationers in London; where∣in you may observe these faults, viz. Gen. 1.21. Cod. for God. and so in many o∣ther places. Cap. 7.3. Cap. 10.19. Cap. 15.3. Abraham, before God changed his name, for Abram. Cap. 18.1. Cap. 27.45. Cap. 34.21. Cap. 46.17. Exod. 12.42. Cap. 16.19. Cap. 19.24. Cap. 26.8. Cap. 29.22. Cap. 40. in the Con∣tents. A Cloud cloudeth. for covereth. ver. 2. Lev. 3.6. Sacrifice of left out. Cap. 7.38. Cap. 8.14. Cap. 10.18. Cap. 11.3. Cap, 13.55. Cap. 15.20. Cap. 22.12. Cap. 23.35. Numb. 1.10. Cap. 6.14. Ram. for Lamb. Cap. 10.29, Cap. 17. in the
Contents. Kept. for Left. Cap. 20.12. Cap. 23.15. Cap. 24.12. Cap. 30. in the Contents. De∣livered. for Divorced. Cap. 31.30. Sheep for Flocks. Cap. 34.9. Out, for On. Deut. 5.29. Cap. 29.5. waked. for waxen. Cap. 34.7. A grosse fault. Joshu. 3.11. another grand one, Cap. 23, 16. Goods for Gods. Judg. 9.17. And advanced his life. for adventured his life. Cap. 15.10. Samon. for Samp∣son. 1 Sam. 24.9. 2 Sam. 8.12. grosse faults, 1 King. 20.6.30. the like, 2 King. 3.2. Cap. 8.5. The Chronicles and Ezra are generally false in the proper Names. Nehem. 8.17. Had the Children of Israel done so. for Had not. Esther 4.1. a grosse fault. Iob 4.6. Is not this thy feare, thy confidence, the uprightnesse of thy ways, and thy hope? for Is not thy fear, thy confidence, and the uprightnesse of thy ways, thy hope? The Titles of divers Psalms are falsly named. Prov. 29.13. Yea, he shall give delight thy soul, for unto thy soul. Eccles. 1.1, Cap. 8.17. Yet he shall not find it, is wholly left out. In the Prophets are great numbers of verbal faults, and omissions, which I pretermit. In the Evangelists are many egregious faults, viz. Luk. 6.22. Cap. 7.43. A base squabble and nonsense. Cap. 9, 13. Loves. for Loaves. Cap. 16.17. Title of the Law. for Tittle. Cap. 19.44. Ioh. 3.17. For God sent not his Sou into the world, for Sonne. ver. 21. Cap. 6.11. Loves, for Loaves. Cap. 18.9, 36. grosse faults, and a dangerous corruption, viz. If my Kingdome were of this Word. for World. Acts 2.27. Because thou wilt not leave my Oul in Hell. for Soul, &c. Cap. 9.36. Cap. 10.14. Cap.
21.2. Nonsense. Cap. 24.24. Iew. for Iew esse Cap. 26.2. Nonsense. Rom. 1.7. Cap. 9.23. Cap. 11.14, 32. A grosse Error, viz. Concluded all in un∣beliefe. for them all, to wit, the Iews. 1 Cor. 1.2, 14. Cap. 3.15. Cap. 9.22. men. for means. 2 Cor. 8.9. Cap. 11.32. Of the Damascens. left out. 2 Thess. 2.16. Heb. 9.8.15. Cap. 12.1. 1 Pet. 2. Nonsense in the Contents. Exhorteth. for Dehort∣eth. ver. 21. Leaving us as an example. A dange∣rous Error. 2 Pet. 1.11.19. 1 Ioh. 2.24. Cap. 4.10. Iude. ver. 4. Rev. 9.18. Cap. 17.4, 14. Cap. 19.10. Cap. 22.17. 7. Moreover during the time of the late Parli∣ament, great numbers of Bibles in a large 12o vo∣lume were imported from Holland in 1656. with this false Title, (Imprinted at London by Rob. Barker &c. Anno 1638.) wherein Mr, Kiffin and Mr. Hills cannot be excused, (if reports be true,) being contrary to the several Acts of Parliament of 20o, Sep. 1649. and 7. Janu, 1652. for regulating of Printing. Wherein are so many notorious Erratas, false English, Nonsense, and Corruptions, that in reading part of Genesis, I found 30. grand faults, as Cap. 27.16. Mouth of his neck, for Smooth of his neck. Cap. 29.13. She. for He ran to meet him. Cap. 30.40. Put them unto. for Put them not unto Labans Cattle. And in reading Ecclesiastes, Canti∣cles, and the first 27. Chapters of Isaiah, I found almost an hundred grosse faults, which I did spe∣cifie to the Parliament, and therefore omit them here; The very Importation of the Books being an offence contrary to the said Statutes, and
ought deservedly to be suppressed; which notwith∣standing are dispersed in the Countrey as afore∣said. You may also take notice of another fault disco∣vered to me by a Reverend Minister, escaped in a 4o. Bible of Iohn Fields, printed at London, (a∣mongst many other faults therein,) viz. Psal. 105.29. He turned their waters into blood, and slew their Flesh, for Fish. And in the singing Psalms by him printed, bound up with several volumes of his Bibles, amongst others, see Psalm 67.2. That all the earth may know the way to worldly wealth. for Godly wealth. Having thus represented the premisses to your own ocular demonstration; and considering the Curse pronounced, Rev. 22. ver. 18, 19. and other Texts of Scripture to that purpose: as also that the pious and Orthodox Ministers do generally complain against the said erroneous Bibles, I submit the whole matter to you; Praying God to inflame your hearts with a fervent love of the truth, and confirme you in the true faith of Christianity; And that it will graciously please his divine Majesty of his infinite goodnesse, and mercy, to blesse this Common-wealth with the like dispensation of his blessed Word in our own proper Dialect, and speech, as it is in the original Idiomes, by the Zeal and Patronage of his Highness, and the Parliament; And that for the private Emolument of any per∣sons (how great soever,) the Scriptures may not be hereafter carelesly, and erroneously printed, where∣by
to save the charges of good Correction, and Printing, as may be plainly proved by such Bibles, which have been printed in late years, or else (as is pretended) the profit will not countervaile the charge: For (as it is credibly reported,) Mr. Hills and Mr. Field have several times affirmed, that they are engaged to pay 500l per Annum. to some, whose names out of respect to them I forbear to mention, over and above 100l per Annum. to Mr. Marchamont Needham, and his wife, out of the pro∣fits of the sale of their Bibles, deriding, insulting, & triumphing over others of the Printing Mysterie, out of their confidence in their great Friends and purse, as it is said, as if they were lawlesse, and free (notwithstanding the truth of the premisses and other grand Enormities often committed by them) both from offence and punishment, to the great di∣shonour of the Common-wealth in general, and dammage of many private persons in particular. For redresse of which inconvenience, and for that I am informed by a Gentleman of Eminence, that upon his own reading of one of their late print∣ed Bibles, he hath noted and observed above 6000. faults therein, I humbly propose (out of my un∣feigned respects to the publique good,) that the future printing of Bibles may neither be solely ap∣propriated to Mr. Hills & Mr. Field, on pretence of their purchasing the translated coppy, made in An. 1611o. and unduely entring it lately as their pri∣vate Copy, and for their sole propriety in the Stationers Register; For that it is neither rational, nor political, that the State should be devested of
the Patronage, and protection of the word of God, translated into English primitively at their charge, & permitted to be printed onely cum privilegio Re∣gali (being the national and common Evidence of our Religion, and like an Elysian flower of Supre∣macie) & that we should make our defence there∣of by and under the private and personal Title of Mr. Hills and Mr. Field, and their Assignes for per∣petuity. Nor secondly, that the Bible-printing may be left again so loosely, and irregularly, (as of late years it was, and is now in designe and project a∣gain) to the liberty of any persons free of the Stati∣oners Company, or qualified to print, for that then a greater mischief will ensue, than at present, as common reason will demonstrate. But thirdly, that such Printers only, as have heretofore dis∣charged themselves with the greatest care and con∣science, & for the honor, and best accommodation and service of the Common-wealth either at Lon∣don or Cambridge, and have also had the full appro∣bation, and allowance of Parliament, in and for printing of Bibles, & such others as shalbe thought meet (not exceeding in the whole, some competent number of able Master-printers) may be hereafter authorized, and permitted to print the Bible, under the States priviledge only, and not as their own pri∣vate Copy, under such qualifications, and provisi∣ons for good Correction, Workmanship, and price, as shalbe expedient for the better ordering and ac∣complishing of such an honorable, laudable, and weighty work and imployment. London, 1o Ianuaij. 1659. Stylo Romano. FINIS.
