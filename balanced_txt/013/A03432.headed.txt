To the righte honorable and vertuous Ladie, the Ladye Marye Sydney, Geffraye Fenton VVisheth a happie encrease of honor and yeares in this lyfe. NICEPHORVS an Historiographer of greate creditt amongest the Grekes, affirmeth, that as euerye knowledge of it selfe deserueth commendacion, so the discipline of histories is most agrea∣ble and necessarie for all ages, which the Roman orator Marcus Cicero full well ap∣proueth A vvitnes or cronicler of tymes, a cādle to the trothe, the life of the memorie, the maister of a mans life, and the reaporter of all anti∣quityes. in commending the studie thereof to al degrées and times as an exercise of moste necessitye and honor, for that (saith he) in theim is represented (as yt were) an ymage or pourtraict of all thinges that haue passed since the begin∣ning of the worlde, to gether with diuersitie of instructions to all sortes of people touchinge their direction in future chaunces euen vntill the laste and extreame dissolucion of the same, not doutinge also in his firste booke De oratore to add certeine peculiar titles, callinge an historie testis tempo∣ris, lux veritatis, vita memoriae, magistra vitae, & nuncia vetu∣statis: For if a man be younge saith e. The readynge ther∣of will make hym olde (not in yeres, with the moste parte cold be content to shyfte of and forgo, but in experience and wisedom, and yf he bée alredye loaden wythe the heauie burden of nature, what a pleasure is it then to beholde the thinges whiche eyther he hath passed in youth, or longe be fore his time were put in practise, whereof as the first is ve∣raye well proued by Euripides the Poett sainge that the re∣membrance of the paine that his past is swéete so th'oppi∣nion Iucundi. acti labores. of TVLLYE (touchinge the other) perswades a greate
necessitie to all degrées to be preuye to the commoditie of stories, for saith he, to be ignoraunt in things happened or thou waste borne, is as much to say as thou wilte be alwaies a childe. There is required in all estates bothe a faithe and Nescire quid antequam na∣tus sis accide∣rit est semper esse puerum feare in God, & also an outwarde pollecie in wordly thinges whereof (according to the philosophers) yt one is to bée lear∣ned by perusinge the scripture, and the other can not bée gotten but by the assistance of histories, who are the onelye and true tables whereon are drawne in perfect coollers, the vertues and vices of euerye condicion of man, bothe their florishynge tyme whileste they embraced the firste, and mi∣serable fal, when they grew in delite with the wickednes of the last: yf a man be a magistrate or beare authoritie in pu∣blike affaires, what labor is better bestowed, then in sear∣chinge the actes of suche as haue supplied equall dignitye and place, to accomodate himselfe to their vertues: and to the priuat person, antiquitie giues choice of admonicions, for obedience to his superiors, with charge to applie and employe all his care for the commoditye of his countreye: yf he bée a citizen, he shall there fynde what belongeth to his proper office eyther in the seruice of his publike weale, or in his peculiar affaires at hoame. And to a woman, what stoare of examples are there to instructe her in her dutie, ey∣ther for the maried, to kepe her fayth to her husband with LVCRETIA, or the vnmaried to defende her virginitye with virginya: fynallye that excellent treasore and full li∣brarye Lyuye. of all knowledge yeldes vs frelye presidentes for all cases that maye happen, bothe for imytacion of the good, Histories a librarie or store house of knovvledg detestynge the wycked, auoydynge a present mischiefe, and preuentyng any euil afore yt fall: wherein also as in euery arte there bée certeine speciall principles and rules for the direction of suche as searche out their disposition, so histo∣ries do swarme with examples of all kinde of vertues, wherein both the dignitye of vertue, and fowlenes of vice appereth muche more lyuelye then in any morall teachyng, seinge therein is figured vnder certeine formes and shaps
of men and their doyngs past, al & euery such diuersitye and chāge which philosophie doth teach by waie of preceptes, like as also (touchinge the commodityes to bee coolled oute of antiquityes) Lyuye is of oppinyon, that the pleasure and proffitt falleth out of indifferent value to suche as bestowe theyr tyme wythe vprighte iudgement in the viewe of auncient recordes, for saith he, nihil est aptius ad delectationem lectoris, quam temporum varietates fortunae{que} vicissitudines cognos∣cere, quae etsi exoptabilia in experiendo non fuerūt tamen in legendo sunt iocunda, and the frute and chiefe gayns deriued of suche traueile is, in that wée shall sée set furthe good and who al∣some lessons of all sortes, whereof we maye take to our selues and benefyt of our countreye, suche as we like to fol∣lowe, and whiche presentes vnto vs the true picture and reapport of suche enterprises, as had both sinister begyn∣nynges and much worse endes, and yet is yt not sufficient for vs to iudge that the only frute consistes in readynge the noble actes of good men, seinge that (of the contrarye) to those that studye to resemble theyr vertues, th'eschewynge of the euill partes in a nomber of vicious personnes, is a singuler commoditye, whiche, yf it were not so the conti∣nuaunce of so many hundreth yeares in all common states aswel heathen as Christened, had not permitted the reading of sondrye Poetes, whose commodies and tragedies im∣porte a discription fyguratyue of the wicked liues of all degrées of men & women, wythout intent to perswade any ymitation that waye, but rather to prouoke the multitude by familyar traines to auoyde such condicions as they sawe iustely reprehended in others: And truly wyth better rea∣son may a man put to the viewe of the worlde any auncient reapport, whose profession is to declare a truthe, then to preferr the fained tales of Poetes, whiche yet we sée for di∣uerse good respectes tollerated to bée redd in all ages. For lyke as in a familye or auncient house, who hath bene most renowmed of all the stocke, leaueth a president and desyer
to his posteritye to resemble his doynges, as a glasse and mirroir to theym of moste excellent vertues, so when hi∣stories are published to the common proffyt of al men, eue∣ry one goeth aboute to confirme himselfe to the vertuous conuersation and lyfe of suche as excelled amongst the el∣ders, wherein me seameth Nycephorus saied veray well, that those whiche write Histories, and kepe not that which is profitable and praise worthie (as it were) in their stoare house at hoame, but rather beinge benefyciall to the com∣mon welthe, do expose so common a profitt to the generall commoditie of all men, are (as it were) th'executours of Gods diuine prouidence, because they comprise and packe vpp in one worke or volume (as in a common treasore, son∣drye sortes of noble deedes, without inhibition or lett to any degrée, to resorte thereunto, and learne by othermens misdéeds, to direct better his owne doinges, and not with th'exchange of the worlde to alter also his minde, but ra∣ther asmuche as lyeth in hym, to ymitate the lyfe and con∣uersation of theym, who haue lyued well before, wherein seinge in this worlde the nature of man in all ages, al∣thoughe the singler personnes bee chaunged, remeineth stil one, so also the good fortunes, felicities, calamities and miseries whyche happen both in publike gouernement and to euerye priuate state, tourne alwayes to one effect and are lyke those of tymes paste, so that by the benefyt of stories, presentinge afore oure eyes a true kallender of things of auncient date, by the commendacion of vertuous, and valyaunt personnes and actes: we be drawen by desyer to treade the stepps of their renowme, and on thother syde, considering the sinister fortune & horrible cases, which haue happened to certeine miserable soules, we behold both th'ex∣treme points wherunto the fraile condicion of man is sub∣iect by infirmitie, and also are thereby toughte by the viewe of other mens harmes to eschew the like inconueniences in our selues: wherein (righte honorable) like as I haue rather touched sleightelye, then vsed tearmes of commendacion at
large according to the worthynes of so precious a Iewell as the knowledg of histories, for that now a dayes euery mans mouth is open to commende the frute distilling from so flo∣rishynge a vine o for my part, beyng more forwarde then hable to discharge my zeale in that behalfe, haue bestowed some of my voyed howers whilest I was in the other sides the Sea, in forcynge certeyne Tragicall Discourses oute of theyr Frenche tearmes, into our Englishe phrase, pre∣sumyng to commende vnto your Ladishypp the frutes and effecte of my trauayle, folowynge therein the order of suche as haue spente tyme in the lyke studye, who are wounte to declare theyr good wyll, by bestowynge theyr labours: wherewithe beinge vnhappelye denyed other frendshypp of fortune to make good my desyer in gyuing an vnfayned showe of the dutye and seruice I owe you and the house whereof you tooke youre begynnynge, am here vppon tearmes of humilitye for preferment of this rude and simple dedication of theis forrein reap∣portes to youre honor, to whose vertues, as I haue chiefe∣lye respected to gyue due renowme, by preferrynge a true purtraict of your conuersation and lyfe in the ver∣tues giftes and ornamentes of the noble ANGELIQVA chaste PAROLYNA, constant IVLIA and renowned CARMOSYNA wyth others, whose integretye of life hath gyuen theim a crowne of immortalitye, wyth a glorious remembrance of theyr names for euer after theyr deathe, so my seconde indeuor was bent to obserue the neces∣sitie of the tyme, chiefly, for that vppon the viewe and examples of oure Auncesters lyues, the fraile ympes of this age, maye fynde cause of shame in theyr owne a∣buses, wyth desyer to exchaunge their badd condicion and order of lyuynge, wyth the studye and desyer to ymi∣tate the vertue of their predecessours, whose lyfe and re∣nowme after death, argueth the vndoubted rewarde, at tendynge (as a thynge of course) the vertuouse and well disposed, where of the contrarye, appeare wounderfull
tormentes and sharpp pennaunce prouided to plage the abhominable and vicious lyuer: Besides it is a princi∣ple and chiefe rule in our nature and disposition to bee rather instructed by examples of familyar authorityes, then reformed by seueritye of lawes, for that the one seames to gouerne vs by awe and commaundement, and in the other appeares a consent of oure fancie, marchinge alwayes accordynge to the direction of our owne willes, for whiche cause the Historians of olde tyme (in theyr seuerall recordes of the actes, conquestes, and noble at∣temptes of Princes and greate men) haue lefte oute no∣thynge seruynge for the ornamente and institution of mannes lyfe, not forgettynge to sett oute also in natu∣rall coollers, theyr tyrannye and other vices, withe con∣tempte of vertue, yf theyr lyues were founde guiltye in any suche offence: But when they paynte oute a good kynge, a magistrate without touche of partiall or coue∣tous mynde, a courtyar loyall and withoute dissimula∣tion, A minister of the Churche not smellynge of hypo∣crysye, but searchynge purelye the honor of God, A La∣dye chaste, honeste, curteouse, a louer of charitye, vsynge a deuoute reuerence to God and feare to hys lawes, yt is then that they allure (by traines of familyaritye) eue∣rye succession to embrace and beholde (as in a glasse) the vndoubted meane that is hable and wylt brynge theym to the lyke perfection in vertue, whyche also moued me to vse a speciall discrecion in coollynge oute suche exam∣ples as beste aggreed wyth the condicion of the tyme, and also were of moste freshe and famylyar memorye, to the ende that wyth the delyte in readynge my dedication, I maye also leaue to all degrees, an appetitt and ho∣neste desyere to honor vertue and holde vice in due de∣testation. And albeit at the firste sighte theis discourses maye importe certeyne vanytyes or fonde practises in loue, yet I doubte not to bée absolued of suche intente
by the iudgement of the indifferent sorte, seinge I haue rather noted diuersitie of examples in sondrye younge men and women, approuynge sufficientlye the incon∣uenience happenynge by the pursute of lycenceous de∣syer, then affected in anye sorte suche vncerteine follyes: For heare maye bée séene suche patternes of chastetye, and maydes so assured and constant in vertue, that they haue not doubted rather to reappose a felicitye in the extreme panges of death, then to fall by anye violent force into the daunger of the fleshelye ennemye to theyr honour: In lyke sorte appeareth here an experience of wounderfull vertues in men, who albeit hadd power to vse and commande the thinge they chieflye desyered, yet (bridlynge wythe maine hande) The humour of theyr inordinate luste, vanquished all mocions of sensualytye, and became maisters of theym selues, by abstaynynge from that whereunto they felte prouocation by nature: who desyereth to sée the follye of a foolishe lover passio∣nynge hymselfe vppon creditt, the impudencie of a maide or other woman renouncynge the vowe of her fayth or honor due to virginitie, the sharpp pennance attendynge the rashe choice of greate Ladyes in séekynge to matche in anye sorte wythe degrées of inferior condicion: or who wisheth to bée priuie to th'inconueniences in loue, howe he frieth in the flame of the fyrste affection, and after gro∣weth not onelye colde of hymselfe, but is easelye con∣uerted into a contrarye shapp and disposition of deadlye hate, maye bée heare assisted wyth more then double expe∣perience touchinge all those euills: the curtesie of an ene∣mye on the behalfe of hys aduersarye, wythe a wounder∣full lyberalitye in the other in retournynge the benefytt receyued, is heare set furthe in fuche lyuelye coollers, that there seames to lacke nothynge for the ornament and decoracion of suche a wooke. And who takes pleasure to beholde the fyttes and panges of a frantique man incensed
to synister conceites by the suggestion of frettynge Ie∣louzye, forcynge hym to effectes of absolute desperation, The due plage of disloyaltye in both kyndes, wyth the glo∣rye of hym who marcheth vnder the enseigne of a con∣trarye vertue, a man of the churche of dissolute lyuyng pu∣nished with publike reproche, or the villenie of the greedye vsurer makyng no conscience to preferr oppen periury in suppressynge th'innocent cause, maye fynde here to satis∣fye his longynge at full, neyther do I thynke that oure Englishe recordes are hable to yelde at this daye, a Romant more delicat and chaste, treatynge of the veraye theame and effectes of loue, then theis hystories, of no lesse credit then sufficient authoritie, by reason the moste of theym were within the compasse of memorye, wherein as I wish the tormentes that pinched here suche as labored in a pas∣sion of follye and fonde desyer, maye worke a terror to all those that hereafter vnhappelye Syp of the cupp of suche ragynge infection, so touchinge the commendable partes of anye Ladye or woman of meaner condicion, mencioned in this volume of discourses, I fynde theym farr to lighte to kepe wayghte wyth the ballance, wherein are paised the qualityes of your honor, whyche seame to haue a cer∣teine affinitye and resemblance wyth suche as were the verye vertuse and causes of commendacion in any that euer deserued the title of moste perfect or iustyle renow∣med: For yf euer the uene of Carya was meritorious for her magnanimytye and bountifull disposition, the quene of Saba whiche some writers call Nycaula, and other Man▪ quedae, was had in honor for her wysedome, whiche was suche that both the olde and newe testament affirme, that she traueled from the ende of the worlde and extreme con∣fynes of the lande of Iud, to come and heare the doctrine of Salomon, wyth whome she disputed no lesse learned∣ly then wyth profode iudgement, or if the constant Ladye Blaudina a Christian borne in the harte of Europe hath pur∣chassed
chassed a crowne of eternetye, in kepinge her fayth and vowe to God and the worlde euen to the laste seperacion of Executed for religion in Fraunce by the Emperor Seuerus in the yere. 178. her sowle and bodye, or yf any other, eyther of antiqui∣tye or familyar experience, of what degree and condicion so euer, haue bene noted of renowme for the gyfte of no∣bilitye in anye sorte, your Ladishipp maye boldelye cha∣lenge place wyth the best, eyther for moderate gouerne∣ment, whose effectes in all thynges you attempte, ar∣gue your worthie participacion with the excellent giftes of temperance and wonderful modestie in, the tj. moste fa∣mous Erles of leicester & Warwike your brotherne, & most vertuous and renowmed Ladye the Countesse of Hunting∣ton your syster, to whose glorie and general loue amongst all sortes of people in this lande, I nede not add further circumstance or increase yf praise, considerynge the whole state, fixinge theyr eyes vppon theym wyth an vnfained zeale and admiracion of their wisdome and vertues, do ad∣uouche in more ample sorte their good will that waye, then I am eyther worthie or hable to declare. And for your cle∣mencie to the case of th'afflicted, vprighte dealynge wyth∣out exaction or cause of grudge to any, wonderfull respecte to the honor of your callynge, wyth dutyfull awe and feare of Godd, and obedience to my Lord your husbande, or other arguments or effects, wherein consistes the praise of a ver∣tuous mind, or ought to appeare the frutes of true nobilitie, they make you not so muche honored in your contreye, as embrased of strangers, who neuer sawe nor knewe you but by name, who also doubte not to make your sincere and de∣uout order of lyuynge, a lookyng glasse to beholde & followe your vertues, and by your order of doing, to drawe the plat and foundacion of their owne life, which shal suffice for this tyme (good madam) for the commendacion of that, whiche is sufficiētly perfect of it self, & so generallie honored of all de∣grées, that it nede not th'assistāce of any peculiar praise: hū∣blie crauing for my part a priuiledge of fauor at your hādes
so farfurthe, as it maye bee lawfull for me to laye theis firste frutes of my trauel vppon the alter alredye garnished wyth other oblacions of your euerlastynge glorye as a remembrance of an humble sacrifice, whiche, I make of my litle labor and contynuall ser∣uice vowed to your Ladishipp so longe as God and nature will allow my abode in this miserable vale: at my chamber at Paris, XXII, Iunij. 1567.

Syr Iohn Conway Knyght to the readers in prayse of the Translator. LIke as the slender bee, by trauayle in her kynde Collects her fruite, the sugred sap wherof we dayly fynde. So heare my learned frend, in nature lyke the bee: Hath linckt his labor to his art, and yeldes the frute to the, In tongue estraungd from vs, whyles this succedynge worke, (As doth the honye in the floure) by couert meane dyd lurke, He laborynge with effecte, hath by his learned payne, Enforst a Frenche man tell his tale, in Englishe language plaine. Not for him self: thou knowest, it aunswered his delyght, By skyll to vnderstande the tale, as dyd the Aucthor write. But toylynge for thy sake, hath fourmd his hyue ful fine, Take thou the combe, the payne was his, the honye shalbe thyne. Good reader yet beware, least Spyder lyke thou take By cancred kinde a spightfull stynge, whence he did honye make. Let not in lewe of payne, a tongue compleate with spyte, Attēpt to harme (though powre shal wāt) the thing that he doth writ For if thou dost: the wies, will feele thy festred kinde, And he to whom thou dost such wronge shal so thy nature finde. No doubt our dayes are suche, as euery man can see And can at ease, and wyll perceaue, the spider from the Bee. Allowe his labour then and worke that well is done: And thou shalt see thee golden race his muse pretends to roon. Let ZOILVS suck the teate, that Enuie holdes in hell, And say with me God spede the penne, that hath begone so well Thus hath he his desyre, thus shalt thou lyue in rest Thus shall his frynds haue at thy hands the sume of their request.

Amici cuiusdam, ad Authorem Carmen Hexametrum. FLoruit antiquo Galfridus tempore Chaucer Scripsit & eximio permagna volumina versu Et multi viguere viri, quos vnica virtus, Nefandos facile effecit tolerare labores. Vixerunt: & sola manet, nunc fama Sepultis At tua nunc primum, (Galfride) virescere virtus Incipit, & teneras cum spe producere plantas: Quae (scio) quàm primumradices caeperit altos, Efferet egregios cum magno foenore, fructus. Ergo quisquis erit, qui fortè reuoluerit ista, (Cuius mens liuore nequit nec amore moueri, Et sapit) haud dubito, quin te dignabitur illa Laude, tuo quam tu magno sudore parasti. Sin minus: hoc vno tibi sat (Fentone) tulisti, Quod Domina est cui des, dono dignissima tanto. TVVS M. M.
George Turberuille in praise of the translator of this booke. IF handycraftesmen haue greate praise for working well By toyling trade the trifling wares which they for money sel: Then why should Fenton feare to purchace prayse of men, To whom he frāckely gyues the gift of this his pleasant pen? If he his busye browe haue beate for our auayle, And for our pleasure taken paynes, why should his guerdon fayle? No gredye golden fee, no Iem or Iewell braue, But of the reader good reporte this writer longes to haue. No man of meanest witt, no beast of slender brayne That thinckes that such a volume great is wrought with slender pain. The thinge it selfe declares what toyle he vndertooke, Ere Fentons curious fyle could frame this passing pleasant booke. The Frenche to Englishe phrase, (his mother language) hee, The darcke to lighte, the shade to sonne, hath brought as you may see. The learned stories erste, and sugred tales that laye Remoude from simple common sence, this writer doth displaye: And what before hee tooke his painfull quyll to write Did lurcke vnknown, is playnelie now to be disternd in sight. Nowe men of meanest skill what Bandel wrought maye vew, And tell the tale in Englishe well that erst they neuer knewe, Discourse of sundrye strange and Tragicall affaires, Of louynge Ladyes haples haps, theyr deathes, ad deadly cares, And dyuers thinges beside, wherby to flee the darte Of vyle deceytefull Cupids bowe that woundes the louers harte. Synce this by Fentons meane, and trauayle thou doct gayne, (Good reader) yeld hym earned prayse and thanckes for taken paine. Then I that made this verse shall thincke as well of the As Fentons worke doth well deserue accompted of to be.

The argument I Meane nothere to increase the merueile of menne, withe a particular description of the sumptuous buildinges of Princes, the mag∣nificall scites and scituations of greate mens houses, nor restore to memory the wounder∣full pollecies and artificiall deuises of oure Auncestoures in making plats and firme fondacions of Castels and Ci∣ties in the bottom of the sea, and muche lesse trouble you withe a reaporte of their ingenious trauaill in castinge downe hils, and makynge Craggy mountaynes flat with the face of the earthe, or forcing stonie Rockes, Hannyball forced a pas∣sage for his armi through the Alpes. with places here to fore impassible, to oppen and make waye to their huge armies, but I haue in presente intente to discouer vnto you the meruellous effects of loue, which excedinge the opynion of common thynges, seames more straunge, then the curious construction and frame of any Pallais for necessitie or pleasure, threatrie or place of sola¦ce buylded by art or industrie of man, or other stately Court what sqware, quadrante, or triangle forme so euer it con∣teines, or other misticall worke yeldinge cause of wonder to the vniuersitie of the earthe, seing that a mortal grudge grounded vppon greate spite, confirmed withe the conti∣nuance of a longe time, and pursued extremelye wythe bloddye persecution and vnnaturall crueltie, is not onely conuerted vpon a sodaine into perfecte frendeshippe, but also by an effecte and operation of loue, made so indisso∣luble that no future accidente or synister deuise of ene∣myes, could once make a breache, and muche lesse vtterly dissolue the league of amity so happely begon and sewerly knite together by the vertue of affection, whyche wee call commonlye the passion procured by loue, wherunto
is also added alike effecte of a thankefull mynde, arguing vnto vs (whythe a famyliar example) that as ingratitude, is the greatest vice ye raynes in the disposition of man, and Ingratitude the chiefeste ennemy: to the honor of nobilitye principall ennemy to the honor of nobilitie, soo the con∣trary, deserueth by iustice the tytle of the moste precious vertue yt is, wherein as the Thebans, were shamefully re∣proched, for the respect of their greate Capttaines Epaimy nondes, and Pelopides, so the Plateons (on the contrarye) were worthely renouned for the large recompence and consideracion they vsed, to the benefyte of the Greekes who deliuered them from the seruitude of the Persians, like as also the Sycyoniens weare yet the crown of eternal, comendacion, for the thankefull returne of the curtesye of Aratus by whome they were frankely taken oute of the handes of cruell tyrantes: if the acte of Philip Marya. late Duke of Myllan deserueth detestacion for the vnnaturall crueltye he committed vppon the person of his wife, who albeit was equall in nobilitie, exceded him in the giftes of fortune and large possessions, of indifferente beaw tye to content a reasonable man, nothinge inferior to the beste Ladye of the countrye in thornaments of nature, and giftes of grace, and yelding hym besides suche honor and honest loue as was necessary for the state of mariage, yet notwithstandinge was he so vnthankefull to all these be∣nefites, that after he had called the flower of her beautye, and forced her to passe an assuraunce of her goods and ly∣nynge to his vse; hee committed secret execution & washed his handes in the blod, of thinfortunate Ladye, contrarye to all ciuilytie or lawe of nature, if he (I saye) seame iustly meritorious of reproche, we maye worthely imparte treble prayse to a barbarous Turke and admirall of the coun∣trey of Arabia, who being ouerthrowen in ye bataile fough∣ten in that countrey, by Bandwin king of Ierusalem, him
selfe and wife prisoners, with his treasure and municion of warre at the disposition of the sayde kinge, and beinge, dismissed frely without exaction or raunsom, and his wife restored withoute violacion, or force of her bodye, iudged it a vertu not to be ouercome in magnificence and libera∣litye, and a mortal vice to beare the title of an vnthanke∣full Prince, whereof he made declaracion for that not longe after the sayde Bawdwine, beinge beseged of the infidels, and by distresse of warre, at point to fal into their mercy the sayde admyral, not vumindefull of the compas∣sion he showed vpon his misery, brake into him by nighte and withe certeine assistantes of horsemen, preuented his present perill, and set him safelye vppon his waye from al offer or feare of daunger. All whiche I haue coated in this introduction, for that my historye importes ii, exam∣ples of semblable substance, the one exposinge a wonder∣full effecte of frendshipp on the behalf of his ennemie, and the other retorninge his liberalitye, withe suche ample consideration, that there is no degre in any Corner ofchri¦stendom-but may se an experience of vertue in the doings of thē both. Wherein I wishe chiefly a perticipacion of the fruite of such examples to all sortes of our contriemen in englande, to thende wee maye forme our lyues vpon ye ver¦teous presedents of such strangers as preferringe vertue afore vice, haue bene more curious to get a true renoume of reputacion, then carefull of a vaine gloriouse or folyshe pomppe of the world.
A WONDERFVL VER∣tue in a gentlman of Syenna on the behalfe of his ennemye, whō he delyuered from Death, and the other to retorne his courtesye vvith equall frendshyp, presented him with his sister whom he knew hee loued entierlye. IN the ecewles or Comentories of tus∣kan I find a special Remembraunce of a mortall grudge betwene ij of the moste noble houses in SYENNA called Salimbino and Montanino, whereof as bothe the one and other were of semblable Reputation for honour and height of estate, so were they of equall Rule & authoritie in the gouernement of their publike weale, whose parentes allbeit and predecessours were of singler commendation by the vertue of mutuall so∣cietye whiche appeared so entyer and indissoluble betwene theim by manye discentes, that the writers in that age dou∣ted not to tearme theym no lesse true myrrroers & patterns of perfect frendship then either HORESTES or PYLLADAS which ye Romain oratour Makes so famous by peculiar com¦mendation, yet according to the opinion of Aristotle, as chil∣dren Children do commonly ra¦ther excede their fathers in vice, then resemble them in ver∣▪ commonly do Rather excede their fathers in vice, then Resemble them in vertue, so the posteretyes of these noble houses, in place to perseuer in the vertue of their parentes, or treade in the steppes of their aunciente amytie, in the ve∣rie entrey of their florishing time, when al men were in ex∣spectacion of verteous frutes like to their fathers withe hope to confirme the league of their long frendeshippe, they embrased sinister occasions of ciuil mutines, groūding great quarrels vpon slender or smal substance, with a dispo¦cition and equall desyre, the one to pursewe the other wyth
such fatal hate and vnnatural tyranny, that as the one was almost brought euen to the brinke of vtter desolation of hys house and Reuenue, so the other (triumphing allbeit in the Conquest of his enemye) escaped not only with out peren∣tory perill of him selfe, & losse of A nomber of his deare kins∣men and Companions of Race, but also was enioyned to so harde A penance, that he lyued alwayes after in the conty∣nuall grudge and desdaine of the people, the viewe of whose malice, preferring A wonderful remorce of conscience, with Remembrance of the fowlenes of the facte passed, pursewed hym with alarams of vnnaturall and frettinge disquiet of minde, euen vntill the last separation of his soule and body. And here if you conferre the quarrell with the cause, and waighe in indiffrent ballance, the mischiues, morders with infinit inconueniences deriued of so small occassions, you nede not doubt to ioyne in opinion with Paulus Iouius & other writes worthy of no lesse Credyte, then of greate fame for learning and skil, who amongest other generall discriptiōs of Italy geueth her this peculiar Commendaciō, that beyng Ytaly a store house for mu¦tinies. subiect to thinfluence of a crabbed Clymate, and quarrelus cōstellacion, termes her to be (of al the world) the only store∣house for percialites and Ciuill faccions, and market place of Tumultes & suborned trobles, which I colde also iustefie by thautority of the warres betwene the florentynes and the Syennoys, with other frée states in ye contreye, besids the eiuil discenciō among the nobility, wt vnnaturall persecutions of families & kinreds, sauing yt the discourse wold seame more tedius then necessarye, and kepe me to longe from the prin∣cipal points of my history, which calles me now to perform my promisse and satisfye the expectacion of the rearder.

This Charles and laste remainder of the house of MONTANINO, being appointed by destenie to lyue yet in spite of his enemies, stirred not out of the towne of SIENNA, where as a solitary man in
the presse of his aduersaries, he liued, without eyther sa∣lutyng or hauntynge the place of theyr repaire, beinge fa∣uored notwythstandynge of the moste parte of the Cytie for that, after so many broyles and horley borleys of warre, A courte of peynall for∣feitures, or cō¦demnatiō for money. which with the fiske had conuerted the greatest parte of his porcion and inheritaunce into nothynge, he lyued notwith∣standing of that lytle whiche fortune had lefte him in honest sorte, meintainynge a traine accordynge to the state and condicion of his lyuynge, hauynge in the house with hym, the companye of his syster, whiche the gods seamed to re∣serue not onelye for his speciall consolation in so greate a calamitie, but also in rest oryng theyr house to hys auncient entier and beinge, to buylde agayne a newe and perfecte frendshipp vppon the fyrste fondacion, and confirme efte∣sones by her vertue a perpetuitie of indissoluble amitie be∣twene her brother and the house of his extreame aduersary her name was ANGELIQVA, whose speciall ornamentes of nature and peculiar gyftes of God, chalenged not on∣lye an equalytye, but a degre aboue the beste and greatest Dames of that Countrey: so seamed she iustelye merito∣rious of that name, with cut doinge wronge to anye, be∣cause her wisdome, womanlye behauiour, with humble curtesye, made suche declaracion of her honestye and ver∣tue, that they whyche hated theyr house and detested the remembraunce of their Race, could not close their mouthes from her due commendacion, nor forbeare to wishe that theyr doughters and children were of semblable disposi∣tion, suche is the operacion and force of true vertue in the hartes of suche as embrace her with vnfayned sinceritie, exposinge in lyke sorte suche frutes as seame wondrous The frutes which true vertue expo∣seth. in the eye of worlde and excede the common imagina∣cion of men, by reducinge the confusion of kindreds into an entier of euerlastynge amytie, and of a mortall ene∣my to make a most assured frende, whereof they that doubte of the goodnes of so greate a gyfte, maye be satisfyed by the
present of proffe this Angeliqua, who so fedd the eares of the cytie with the generall Brute & cōmendacion of her vertue, that in one moment, he which earst was chiefe and captaine of the warre against theim, and seamed inuincible against, all the ayde and assistaunce they could procure, is nowe be∣come a slaue and most subiect to the viewe and contempla∣tion of her beautie, in suche sorte, as by litle & litle, he grew into termes of extreme affection and vndowted zeale towar¦des her whose name he hated earst, no lesse then the Canke∣red styng of the cruell Cockatrice, wherin as the humor of his loue seamed to excede the ordinarie impressions of men in that case: So he neyther was hable to resiste the hoate sommaunce of his newe appetit, nor kepe warre any tyme with the suggestion of his sodayne desire, but as one that felt hymselfe striken with the thonderbolt of his destynie, gaue place to his sentence, and entred into deuise with him∣selfe, what waye too vse, to wynne the encounter of hys fancie. The remembraunce of the late wronge he had done theim, seamed a great impediment to his purpose, neyther had he the meane to demaunde her in mariage, Whose tea∣res were skarce drye in bewailyng the desolation he hadd so lately thondred vpon al their house, the simple view and re∣corde wherof, preferred iust cause of dispaire to obtaine the good will of her brother, wherwith feling a daily increase of his passion, with continuall diminution and vnlikelyhod of meanes to releue his tormēt, specialy, for that he had impri∣soned his liberty, where no raunsome could serue to redeme it, and that loue had bounde hym to so harde a pennaunce, that the only pleasure he had in life, was to thinke vpon her, whome dispaire denied him to reclaime by anye meanes, he began to curse thee first cause of the quarell, and wyshe the huntyng of the boare hadd neuer ben tollerable in Italy, in∣ueighyng withall agaynste the malice of hys fortune, that seamed to be his guide in the pursuete of so great persecu∣tion, and now in the hope & expectation of reste and repose from toyle, to committ hym to the mercy of a martirdome
more intollerable then the torment of the whele, and of lesse hope to be deliuered, thē the Damned soules out of theuerla¦sting flame in hell, wherin also his chiefeste greffe & grudge of minde semed to stande vpon double termes, both for yt he durst neyther discouer his disease to any his owne trendes, whom he knewe woulde rather mislike his request, then be moued to compassion vpon hys case, or studye to releue his distresse, nor promise himselfe any likelihod & much lesse as∣surance euer to cooll eyther flower or fruite of his affection to Angeliqua, for that he thought she had no reasō to remorse vpon him, in whose face appeared yet the fresh Remēbraūce of the late reuenge and destruction of her kynsmenne. But what? who doughteth of the tickle dispositiō of fortune, or is not perswaded that the doings of men are as subiect to chaung & alteration, as the lament to mutability and diuer setie of complexions. At  time as the greate Iupiter so∣moning the winds and violence of other weather, to qua∣rell with the Calme and quiet skye, eclypsyng the naturall clerenes of the son by conuerting him into sondry sortes of darke and dim colloures or what constancye or assurance is to be Reapposed in our worldly affaires, seynge the veray thoughtes and imaginatiōs of men are disposed & gouerned by the reuolucion & course of tymes, wherin the philosopher is of opinion that no degre is dispensed from the Clymat of the cōstellatiō for saith he, the fauors & displeasures of prin∣ces are neither so mortal nor of such continuance, but being incident to conuersion, we see in one momente, an assured coniunction of frendship with him, who earst pursewed our subuercion with mortall hate. And truly he that weigheth ye comutacion of thinges with indiffrent iudgmēt, may iustly note him of gret simplicity, that resolues perpetuity or con∣tinual stay or abode in any thing, that is either accidental or proper to mā, wherin as I am sufficiētly iustefyed by Aun∣cient All things are subiect to chaunge.

For within the Cytye of SYENNA dwelte a longe nosed marchaunte, who for the moste part as they be more gredy to gette, then worthie of that which they haue, so do they seldom or neuer respect the meane, so they may finger that which they wish. He had ioyning to the vttermoste subburbes of the cytye a faire howse enuironed with large demaines, where vppon confyned on al partes certaine peces of grounde of the saide MONTANYNO, which with a bare house in the towne, as it
was al yt the malice of his fortune had left hym of the ample patrymonye of his parentes, So this hungrye burgeys, thinkinge it no offence or grudge of conscience, to enlarge his lyuinge withe the porcion of his neyghboure, kno∣winge well enoughe, that after so many occasions of greate expenses, he was not onlye in distresse for monye but wan∣ted other necessary furniture, sent his broaker to boarde him for the sale of his lands in ye contrey, with cōmission to geue hym a thousande Duckats for those groundes which ioyned to his lordshippe without the subberbes, wherin his request was frustrate and he out of hope that waye to wyn theffect of his desyer, for that CHARLES, was resolued to make store of those groundes aboue the rest of that lytle that was left him, chefly for that besydes they were percell of thaunci¦ent possessions of his parēts, yet he reserued a spicial zeale to those landes, because the viewe of theim restored a freshe re∣membrance of suche as in maney ages before had borne the grertest swaighe in that publike weale, wherwyth the coue tus villayne not contente with the reasonable deniall of the gentleman, did not imediatlye dismisse his desier to get that which he ought not to haue wished, but determined not only to win it by vonderly meanes, but also for reueng of ye plain Answere of the MONTANYN entred into deuise to subborne some meanes to haue it at a lesse price, and not without the hazarde and perill of the lif of ye pore gentilman, followinge therin the detestable example of thiniuste Iesabell, who pro∣cured the death of Naboothe, to th'ende she mighte enioye his possession, wherin he was furthered euerye waye, but chief∣ly with th'assistance of the tyme. For at the same instaunte, by reason of the mutuall quarels and ciuil dyscentions that raigned longe before in the moste partes of Italye, moste of the nobilitie were driuen the countrye, and those few that remayned, lyued not only vnder the awe of Townclarks & Catchepowles chosen by the rurall crew, but also had small assuraunce of sauetye, in their townes or Cities, where for the more subiection and awe of the Gentlemen, this villa∣nous
sect of cursed caterpillers made a lawe, not muche vn∣like the tyrannous statute which the Athenians hadde in the time of solon, that no man of what degrée or condicion so euer hée were, shoulde neyther by himselfe, nor procure∣ment of any other, go aboute to purchasse the reappeale or re¦stitution An vngodlie Lavve. of any that were banished their countreye, vpon payne to yelde to the fyske a thousande florentes, with ad∣dicion, that if he were not hable to aunswere the condemna∣cion within ten days, to loase his head in remembrance of ye forfeyte: who markes well the misterye of this lawe, maye easely iudge the viperus meaninge of those wretches, who rather resemble the barbarous tirants and infidels without faith, then seame to haue the hartes of true Christians, and happye is hee that is not borne vnder the gouernemente of suche a state, where they doo not onlye shutte the gates of compassion against their innocente neighbours and frends, habādoned their countrey for peculiar grudges one against an other, but also punished by an vnnaturall crueltye the vertue of suche as seke to supply the affliction of theym that ought to be of equall regarde and honor to the best of them, & besides that this oppressour of innocents was bothe one of ye lawe makers, and chiefe minister and commaunder of the same, yet was he sewer of a seconde assistaunce whiche sea∣med no lesse auailable to him then the aduantage of his po∣wer or authoritie, wherefore dispencinge withe no time in the execution of his deuelish deuise, he somoned Don CHAR∣LES by write to appeare before the Senat, where was layde afore hym the breache of the sayd lawe, and for a more profe or plaines of yt matter, thaccusacion was no soner published then he hadde at his elbowe double choise of periured wit∣nesses, who what by the awe of his authoritie, and thinfec∣ting somonce of certaine peces of golde, wherwith he had fyled their tongues afore, aduouched thappeale by othe, de∣posinge further that they knewe where he hadde solicited to redeme diuerse of his banished frends, seking to supplant the state of the city by restoring the nobles and gentlemen to
their aunciēt rule & authoritie whiche made ye pore Montanyn in suche double amaze of doubt & feare, that he was not only voyde of councel for the present, but in dispair to defende his right againste the malice of the whole state, chiefly for that the procurer of the fyske smellynge thapproche of so greate againe, awarded authorities to arrest his body to prison, and pursued his processe with suche expedicion that within .vj. dayes he was condemned vppon the statute of rappeale, and to paye the forfait within .ix. dayes after, or els to leaue his head in pawne of the payment, the lawe imported suche rigour that there was no place for mediacion or sute of in∣treatye, and the eares of the iustice were closed againste the complaint of innocents, neither durst any man inueighe on his behalfe for feare of hym that was thauthor of thact, and the ayde of kynsmen is as colde in that countrey as in o∣ther places, and frendes nowe a dayes resemble the rauen or hungry kyte, who neuer flyeth but towardes the place where they hope to fynde some thinge to praye vpon, so the frendes of our age be fled so far from the vertue of true frēd∣shipp, that they will not onely refuse to releue hym whome God and nature hath bounde them to susteine, but also make no conscience to disclaime the name of a kinsman to the nea∣rest allye they haue, and that without any cause onlesse you will impute it to the want of equall welthe, wherein mine owne experience moueth me to make a chalenge to some in England, if my power were as indifferent to pleade with hym, as I haue iuste reason to put hym in remembraunce of his fault, albeit that quarels is tollerable which marcheth vnder the flagge of innocency and truth, and iuste obiections wil make the guilty blushe, but nowe to the sorowful MON∣TANYN who complayninge the points of his desaster in a darke prison where was no kynd of consolation, nor yet the offer of any ECCHO to resounde his dolorous cryes, was sa∣luted the nexte daye with a copye of his sentence diffinitiue, wherin he was taxed to the some of a M.

euill neyghbour, and how greatly they do thurst that deste∣re to drinke of an other mans cupp, but chieflye the insatia∣ble longyng of suche as are with child for an other mans li∣uyng: and albeit his conscience was without grudge for any offence or breache of the lawe yet his grief seamed of harde tolleracion because the cursed trayson of a Cankard Clow∣en shoulde tryumphe ouer hym so farre, that to quenche the glot of his couetous rage he shoulde be forced to disinherite himselfe, and leaue without succour his deare syster, who for her part was so dolorous on the behalf of this newe de∣saster fallen vpon her brother that she sturred not out of her chamber, nor once suffered her eyes to bee dry from teares, since the firste newes of that sorowfull accident, whiche she complayned with more vehemency because she sawe a pre∣sent approche of perentory destruction to the little remeinder of the whole house, alas saith she, is the crueltye of fortune of suche rigorous condicion or her malice of suche perpetui∣tye that she will graunte no dispense nor admit any obla∣cion or offer to purchasse her fauor, or is ther no sacrafice to satisfye the angry dispositiō of the heauens, who ceasse not to thonder whole millions of mishappes vpon this desolate and wretched house of ours, with continuaunce of their angrye regards euen vntill thutter dissolution of the same? howe much better had it ben for vs fewe which remaine of the de∣kayed stocke and withered generacion of MONTANYNO, to haue passed amongest the rest of our companions, by the edge of the sworde of the enemye, then in lyuynge, to be miserable partakers of the vniuste malice of such as are not onely common enemies to innocency, but bearynge a natu∣rall grudge to the veray remembraunce and name of no∣bility, do hunt with open mouth (as the rauenyng wolfe) to deuoure the discents of noble kynd: how can this beare the name of a free cytie, or iustely merite the tytle of a state not incident to seruile lawe, where the gouernement passeth vnder the conueyghe of a confused multitude, whome na∣ture hath ordeined to drawe the yoke of other mens awe,

Ah brother saith she with a freshe sup∣plye of sorowfull teares, howe rightely can I conster the cause of thy presente trouble, and indifferent vndoing of vs both, the example of thy wronge argues sufficiently the de∣testable disposition of our cursed Senatours, who seame more gredye to hunte the chasse of vnlawfull and fylthye gaine, then carefull to kepe their conscience wythout spott or grudge of manifest oppression and wronge? for yf the desyre of thy litle liuynge in the countrey, and gliste∣ringe shewe of thy greate house in the open gaze and eye of the whole worlde passing by the streetes had not sturred vp the couetous humour of that rauenouse marchaunte, thou hadst lyued free from care, and thy estate farre from anye question in the SENATE house, neyther woulde any man haue charged thee with imputacion of a thing, which I wold to God thou hadst not onely vndertaken, but also broughte to effecte, to the ende thou mightest haue bene the author and I the witnes of the iuste reuenge of this villanous crew whose naturall malice more then eyther reason or iustice doth clogge the with this harde imposition of manifest wronge: there is no reason that a peltynge marchaunt ne∣uer norished in anye skole of cyuill or curteous educati∣on other then in a shoppe amongest prentises and compa∣nions of his owne calibre, or the son of hym that is a slaue and seruile borne by kynde, shoulde eyther beare office in a common welthe, and muche lesse sytte in iudgement of theym whose harts by nature abhores to be tryed by the BARBAROVS voice of so vile and base people, oh how happy be theis states & contreys, where hynges gyue lawes, and princes vse respect of fauor to suche as resemble them in condicion and vertue: neither hath he greate cause to grudge with his dome, that hath his cause debated in the presence of his prince, and his sentence published by suche as bee of equall honor and Reputatyon, where wee alas maye iust∣lye

I woulde our predecessours or some good fortune of forreine tyme by re∣ducy nge this countrey into a Monarke, had established a seat Royall of a Kynge wyth authorititye that only his seede and succession sholde gouerne the whole▪ rather then by lea∣uing it thus dispersed into diuerse cōfuced liberties, to make vs a mutuall praye one to an other: for haue we not the Frenchemen at oure backes? and the army of the greate Uicare of Rome one the one side with the subtil Florentins ready to inuade vs on the other side, in suche sorte, as who so is hongry maye boldly praye vppon vs without resistaunce, and yet for a more increase of our wrechednes wee main∣teine warre with our selues, and the best parte subdued and made thrall to suche as are not worthy any waye to be vallet to the worste of vs that feles our selues greued with suche afflictiō, but what can satisfy ye couetousnes of man, or what benefit can stay hym that is giuen to perfidie or falsehod, & to what ende alas serue my teares or tunes of dolorous excla∣maciō, if not in recordyng the circunstaunce of oure mutual grief, to restore a freshe remembraunce of thy peculyar de∣saster, oh deare brother, whose destinies I see will not dis∣misse the rigor of their dome till they haue brought vs both to the brinke of extreme subuercion, albeit yf the offer of my bodye in sacrifice, or other mortall execution, wolde serue to redeme thy libertye, and preserue thy possession in entier, assure thy selfe that thy pore ANGELIQVA wold be no lesse readye to make exchaunge of her life for the raun∣som of thy contentement and quiet, then theis wyde mow∣thed Rokes do seke and gape to deuoure thy honour & liuing. And as the dolorous Lady was thus in tormēts of dule with more passiō on ye behalfe of her brother, thē care any waie for her self, yt pore Montanine stādīg betwen a hard sētēce & a most

Here maye be noted the vertue & operacion of the couetous mynde infected with the desyer of fylthie gaine, whose frutes are to thurste after other mens goods, & glory
in the dekaye of their neighbour, with a dispositiō to conuert ye vngracions spoyles of their brethren into a pleasaunt pray to their rauening appetite, without regard notwithstāding to thexpress inhibicion of God in diuerse places of the Scrip¦ture, or respect to the dutie of his conscience, or burthen of his soule, wherin besides ye peynall threates of our Sauiour in the worlde to come, he seames also to hyer a tormentor to molest his quiet during his abode here, for the more he is in The coue∣tous minde is neuer in quiet accor∣ding to the vvordes of thappostle. deuise to encrease his welth, the faster decreaseth his quiet, & himselfe so subiect to declinacion, according to the wordes of the Apostle, that a couetous man taketh more reuenge of himselfe beinge on lyue, then h is enemy when he is deade, neyther doth he consume the daye in other deuises, then in accumulacion of threasor, nor yeldes charitie to any but his golden coffers, whome he will not deffraye nor once demi∣nishe of a simple denier if it were to redeme the lyfe of hys naturall father, you haue hard his former offer of a thousand ducats, with no lesse desier to haue it at that price, & now you see he doth not only refuse it, but in a mockerie makes a dis∣dainfull tender of vij .C.

And that which scamed to restore her dollorous passion, with a freshe supply and increase of newe sorowe, was the heauie newes of diuerse of her neare kynsmen tou∣ching the spedy approch of the extreme date & delay of the sen∣tēce diffinitiue, which as they had not onli indeuored to differ

ANSEAMNO SALYMBYNO whome heretofore you haue harde to bee sore passioned with the loue of ANGELYQVA hauing spente certaine dayes of recreacion in the contrey, is now returned to SYENNA, where passyng by the gate of his ladye, he chaunced to heare a lamentable noyse of wo∣men, bewailyng the misery of the montanynes, wherwith pursewyng the brute with a more diligente eare, spyed at last commyng out of the pallayes of ANGELYQVA certain olde dames his nexte neighboures, all to bee sprent and died with the dew of sorowfull teares, as though they hadd then cōme from the funeral of some of their frendes, of whom he enquired the cause of suche vnacustumable Dule, and whe∣ther & what new misfortune wer happened of late to ye house of ye Montauyns, and being at larg resolued of that which you haue hard by speciall reporte went imediatlye to his cham∣ber, where he began to discourse diuersely of this soddaine chaunce, sometyme determining the deliuerie of CHARLES for the only respect of his syster, whose good wil he thought he cold not purchase any waye so well, as by the benefyt and pryce of so greate a frendshyppe, by and by hee accompted the death of her brother a moste necessarye meane to make him the maister of his desire ouer his sister, wherin after he had spente somtyme in secrete cogitacion, without any cer∣teyne resolution notwithstandyng what to do, he seamed to Salymbyno debateth vvith himself tou∣ching the de∣liuerye of his ennemie. aske open councel of himselfe in this sorte. What cause haue I hereafter to dowte of the thing I chiefly desyer, seyng for∣tune seames to take more care of my contentement, then I am hable to wishe or imagyn, vndertaking (as it seames) to presente me wyth theffecte of my busynes whenne I leaste thoughte of any hope or likelihod of good successe, for by the death of the MONTANYN who is to be executed to morowe in publike as a rebell or heynous offendor of the state, I shal not only see the laste reuenge, of the most mortall enemyes of our house, but also liue without feare, hereafter to be mo¦lested by any that shal discend of hym, and on the other syde. his death takes away al impedimētes, offering either to stay

But what SALYMBYNO? shal the offer of any vnseamely reueng preuaile aboue that respect and duty thou art borne to beare and owe vnto true vertue, or wilt thou so much abuse ye former glory of thy auncestors and present renowne of thy selfe with an acte no lesse detes∣table afore GOD then hatefull to the cares of all degrees of honestye? and wilte thou thus deceaue thexlpectation of thy frends, and leaue them in continual reproche to the posteri∣tye of all ages, with a note of suche infamye that tyme her selfe can skarce race out of the remembrance of man? if all thies lacke authority to diswade the, let only the respect and awe of vertue with remorce of conscience kepe the frome comitting so hainousanoffence: for to wh at other end haue the auncients put a diffrence betwene the gētlemen & crea∣tures of baser condition, but that in exposyng fruites of cy∣uill courtesye, wée should also stryue to make our selues no∣ble and excede theim in thimitacion of true vertue? and as it is far frō the office of a noble hart to thunder Reueng vpon such as are not hable to resyst thy power, so there can be no greater argument or proffe of true magnanimytie, then in buryenge the desyer of vengeaunce in a tombe of eternall obliuion, to expose moste fruites of compassion, where there appeares greate cause to extende the vttermost of rigour, and where on thaduerse partie, is leaste exspecte or hope of succoure, for how canne a man lay a more sewer soundation of perpetuall glorye, then in correctinge the humoure of hys fowle appetite and conquerynge the vn bridled affecti∣ons

The chiefest pointes of so large cōmendacion which so many recordes of antiquitye do attribute vnto the greate Dictatoure CESAR, consiste more in the clemencye hée vsed to his ennemies being vanquished and vnder the awe of hys mercye, then in the mortall and manye battailes he fought agaynst the valiaunte.

What cause haue I then to renew the ala∣ram of their miserie, or why stay I to succour their desolate state, in some satisfaction of the iniuries they haue receiued by me and mine, besides the wrathe of God accordyng to the wordes of the Apostle, is alwaies hanginge ouer the heades of suche, as seame to take pleasure in the affliction of their neighbour, reioyce in the misfortune or misery of an other, if all thies lacke sufficient force to mortifie the remembrāce of auncient malice within me, and in exposing (contrarie to the exspectatiō and opinion of the world) a wonderful exam∣ple of vertue, to moue me to releue his distresse that dispai∣reth of all succour, and reclaim by liberalitie the frendeshipe of him, who if he euer offended is alredye pardoned, like as also if his innocency haue bene abused by me and mine, my cōscience calleth me to a remorce, in rendring satisfaction in so nedeful a time: yet am I drawen by a band of further du∣tye, and incensed by a somaunce or special instigacion of the honour and seruice, which my harte hath alredye vowed, on the behalfe of her: whose beauty & vertue deserues a greater méede, then the vttermost that I can do, eyther for the cōten∣tement of her, or consolation of her brother, for like as ther is no man (onlesse he bee vtterlye deuested from the gyfte of humanitye) beinge passioned with equall affection and so∣somoned
by semblable desire to doo some notable seruice to my deare ANGELIQVA as I am, that woulde not racke hys power to the highest pyn, to take awaye the chiefe causes of her dolefull teares, and restore her to a spedie contentment conuenient for her merite: So in louinge her I muste also imbrace suche as shee accomptes and (by good righte) are moste deare vnto her. And if I will make a declaration of the true zeale I beare her, why do I staie to expose it in so nede∣full a time, and on the behalfe of him, whome shee loueth no lesse then her selfe, attending euen now the fatall stroake of the morderinge sworde for a tryfflinge due of a thousande florentes: and why shoulde I doubte to make it knowen in publike that only the force of loue hathe made me trybutary to the faire ANGELIQVA, for seinge that kinges and the greateste monarkes of the Worlde do drawe vnder the yoke of his awe, it is not for me to eschewe that by speciall pryui¦ledge, whiche is incidente to all men by nature, neyther ought I herein to refuce the offer of my destenie, nor straun gers to enter into muche maruaile, if I (beinge of the met∣tall of other men and subiect to no lesse impression and passi∣ons of mynde then the reste) do make presente dedication of my harte and seruice to her whose vertue I am sewer is so in vincible agaynst all aduersitie, that neyther necessitie, nor the moste extreame message that fortune can send her, is ha¦ble to make her forfeyte the leaste pointe of her honestie, or forgette the renowme of the genelogie wherof she is discen∣ded: wherin as honest loue hath sturred vp this mocion in me with composicion to expose imediatlye the frutes and effecte of semblable vertue: So the spedye delyuerye of thy brother (Oh: ANGELYQVA) shal argue sufficientlye to all men, that it is only the regarde of thy beawtie that hath paied the price of his raunsom, and remoued frome his tender legges the heauye yrons whiche the penaunce of harde imprisone∣mente had vniustlye enioyned vnto him, tryumphinge also with this increase of further glorye, that onlye the regar∣des and glauncis of thy glisteringe eyes haue made a breach

And thou SE∣IGNEVR CHARLES for thy parte hast this daye gained so assured and perfecte a frende, that if thou wilt confirme the league by franke consente, thamytie shall not be onlye mutuall betwene vs till deathe discharge the same by sepe∣ration of oure bodies, but also remeyne no lesse indissoluble to the posterytie and succession of bothe oure races for euer: And as in the firste worke of this newe societie, I will not only stryue to excede the in showe of perfecte frendeshippe, but also make the waye open by my example to all degrees of nobilitie to attaine to the like honour by semblable vertue So I pronounce heare a further confirmation on my parte, with protestation by the faythe and lyfe of a gentleman to embrace the and thy frendes with no lesse affection then my selfe and persecute thy enemyes with no lesse mortalitie then yf they had conspired and put in vse the destruction of the noble house of SALYMBYNO: wherwith seinge the ne∣cessitie of the tyme, craued rather an expedition of diligence, then longer discourse, or deliberation, hee tooke a bagge of a thousande duckattes and weymediatly to ye Deputie re∣ceauor of the peynall forfeytures of the state of SYENNA whom hee founde perusinge certaine accomptes in his sto∣die. And after he hadde taken him the bagge, with addition that there was the whole demaunde due by DON CHARLES MONTANYN, he commaunded to giue an acquitance withe his writte of delyuery from thinstante: but tellinge the con∣tentes of the bagge he founde a surplusage of the some due by the prysoner, which as he offred to restore, so the other did not onlye refuce to take it, but also woulde not departe the place, till he had dispatched one of his people to the maister of the Iayle, who perceiuing a tender of the money, wythdrewe the accion, & sent to fetch ye prisoner out of his dōgion & darke cabynet, clogged with heauye shackels and clinkinge yrons
CHARLES hearinge a noyse of bownsinge at doares and o∣pening of rustie lockes, imagined it had bene the comminge of some ghostlie father to heare his shryft and laste confes∣sion, and that the senatte (in respecte of the honour and esti∣macion of his house had graunted him the priueledge of a se∣crete execution within the prison, for auoydinge the publike shame whiche comonlye attendes the miserye of such as de∣clare their laste testament vppon the skaffolde in the gaze of all the worlde: and hauinge alredye examyned his consci∣ence accordinge to the shortnes of his leasure so farfurthe as he seamed only to attende the fatall hower, desyred god eft∣sones to strengthen him with hys grace, not leauinge him wythout assistance in his iourneye and passage so perillous, where oftentymes the moste assured do not only wauer but vtterly declyne, if they be not supported by his speciall fauor in the ende of which secret meditacion, he comended vnto his goodnes the lyfe of his deare syster, desiering with humble teares in a speciall peticion and last requeste to be protector and defende her alwayes from all assaltes and offers of infa∣mie or dishonour being thus brought into the hal of the Iay∣lor, the tormentours or officers of the prison, begā to knocke of the boltes from his legges, and present hym besydes (in show of countenance) rather with arguments of consolation then cause of freshe disquiet or distruste of delyuerie, which kinde of curtesy not loked for stirred vppe in his troubled minde a soddaine hope or expectation of good fortune, with an absolute assurance almoste of that which affore he durste neuer ymagine, and muche lesse accompte to come to passe, wherof notwithstandinge the effecte appeared at thinstant, for the Iaylor showinge him his letters of deliuerie, tolde hym it was in his power to vse the benefytte of hys former lybertye, for saythe hee the lawe is choked and fullye aun∣swered of her due, and I safysfyed to the vttermoste of the charges and fees of youre imprisonmente, desyeringe you (Sir) if you haue founde worse entreatie att my handes thenne I see youre offence hathe deserued to consider the
charge of my office, and to impute it rather to the straite comission enioyned mee by the sentt, then any de∣syer of my selfe to deale with you in other sort, then the bond and respect of the dutifull zeale I beare you dothe require. Here is to be noted a wonderfull difference in the casualties accidentall to man, and that the chaunges and alterations in loue be of a contrary disposition to the reste of the passions that trouble the minde: neyther nede we doubt by the autho∣ritie of this example, no lesse credible then of great admiraci∣on, but loue is a certaine vertue of it selfe, seinge it workes theffect and exposeth suche frutes as seame to resemble ra∣ther the operactōof a deuine miracle, then the suggestion of our fraile fancye, for howe had this SALYMBYNO redemed so frelye and in a tyme of such nede, the carefull CHARLES (beinge firmely confirmed in mortall grude as you haue harde) if the verye vertue whiche we are not hable to tearme by al proper name in loue had not broken by force of azealous affection, the angrie inclinacion of his nature, and conuerted the humor of his auncient wrath into a compassion exceding the imagination of manne. And as it is an ordenarye argument of humanytie to giue succours to suche as ney∣ther haue deserued any thinge of vs and muche lesse wee ne∣uer knewe nor sawe, because nature herselfe dothe somon vs all to be thankefull to such as resemble our selues in con∣dition or callinge: So that vertue deserueth treble comenda∣tion, whiche excedinge (as it were thauthoritie of nature) doth force in vs suche an inclynacion whiche dothe not only mortefye in our hartes the obstinat humor norished of long continuance, but makes vs plyable to the thinges which we colde not somuch as admitte afore into oure cogitacions and much lesse performe by any perswacion of the worlde: wher of you maye note a familiar experience in the disposition of this SALYMBYN who suffred himselfe to be more ouer∣come wyth the bewtie, vertue and seamelye behauior of ANGELIQVA, then with any humilitie or importunatte sute of her brother althoughe hee hadde layen prostrate a
thousande tymes afore his knee. And what hart is tempe∣red with the mettal of such induracion that is not mollified, and made tractable by the regardes of so rare a misterie, as the exquisite beautye of this SYENNOYSE, or who wil not slacke the Raine of his loftie stomacke and stoupe to the so∣mance of suche a paragon, humblynge hymselfe withall e∣uery waye to get the good will of her that gaue place to no creature in the worlde for all perfections of God and na∣ture, neyther is there any reason at all to charge hym with imputaciō of foly that indeuoureth to honor and imbrace in his hart, the beautye and other giftes of so vertuous a La∣dye, nor his trauaile meritorious of other name, then the title of honest exercise, who addinge an exact diligence to his dutifull zeale and seruice in the pursute of her whose vertues procure his affection, hath his harte armed onelye with an vpright meanyng of sincere integritye, and the de∣sier of his minde tendyng to none other ende then a consom∣mation of an honest and lawfull request: But for the con∣trary of this honest societie, I accompt hym not worthie to haue the ayre breath vpon hym, who practisinge onely to se∣duce and corrupte the chasteye of honest Dames, hath no respect to the vertue of honest and true loue, but sekyng on∣ly to satisfy the appetit of his sensual luste, doth embrace the exterior partes of a woman, and commendes simplye the tree charged with leaues, without regardyng the frut which makes it worthie of commendacion and fame. Here with it can not be muche frō our purpose to enterlarde this digres∣sion, with the authoritie of a brief note, whiche I founde written in a frenche booke on the behalfe of the sinceritye which ought to appeare in women, comparinge the younge Ladye bearynge yet the name of a mayde to the glisterynge flower in the pleasaunt springe, vntill by her constancie and chaste behauior, subduing vtterlie the wanton mocions of the fleshe, she expose to the worlde the precious fruites deriued of so greate a vertue and giue absolute experience other vndoubted pudicitie: For otherwayes (saith he) she
is in no other degree for worthie renowme, then the young soldiour whose contenaunce albeit argueth the corage of his hart, yet his capteine hath no reason to gyue iudgement of his valiauntnes, nor cause to reapose muche credit in him in any expedition or exploite againste thenemye, tyll he see an approued effect in dede of that which he promiseth so largely by his outward apparance, but when he fyndeth an absolute confirmation of the exterior likelihodes by the inward vertu and valyauntnes of the mynd, it is then that he doth not only embrase hym, but preferreth hym afore the rest as a speciall pattorne to ymitate his vertues Euen so besides that the Croune of immortal glorye, atten des youe Ladyes, who by withstandynge thassaultes and importunities of the fleshe, do giue to your selfe the true title of honest women, not by force or awe of constraint, but by the valyaunt resistance of your most chaste and inuincible hart, yet also the monumēt of your vertues being graued in pillors of eternitie, and ad∣uaunced to the height of the highist theatrey in the worlde, shal remaine as a mirroer or worthy spectacle to procure all posterities not onelye to treade the pathe of semblable ver∣tues, but also to yelde you a continuall adoracion after your death by the remembraunce and viewe of your chaste & ver∣teous life, wherewith wishyng you al no lesse desier to lyue wel, then the most of you are gredy of glory. I leaue you to the remorce of your owne consciences & presentes you here withe the remeinder of my promisse touchyng the sequele of CHARLES MONTANYN, who being out of prison as you haue harde repaired immediately to his house, with intent to comfort her, whom he knewe to be in greater dollour and distresse, and as nedeful of consolacion, as himselfe seamed desirous of repose, being so longe forewatched in a filthy pri¦son, and knocking at the gates of his Pallais, the mayd that opened the dore and saw it was her maister, mounted with more speed then an ordinarie pase and tolde ANGELIQVA the deliuerye and approche of her brother, wherunto (what addicion or protestation her mayde seamed to make) her
troubled mynde wolde giue no credit: suche greate impossi∣bilitie do wee accompte in the execution of those thinges whiche we chiefly desier: but seaminge no lesse amazed with the misterie, thē saint Peter being soddainly taken furth of the prison of HERODE by the Aungel, sloode as thoughe she had bene dreaming of the dissolution of the worlde without apparance of sence or argument of lyuely moriō in any part of her til ye presence of her brother (being now in her chāber) seamed to breath in her an ayre of fresh cōsolatiō & lyfe, & dis∣missing frō thinstāt ye misterie of her domme traūce, receiued oftsones her former vse & libertie of senses, wherewith cōuer¦ting her dolorous regards & teares of aunciēt dule into a pas¦sion of such sodain gladnes, that being at ye point to cōgratu∣lat his cōmig with words, she felt a secōd impedimēt of spech by ye operatiō of preset ioye which she toke in beholding his face, yt she fel down at his fete, embrassig & kissyng his knees with no lesse signes & shewe of a gladsome mynde, then if by som miracle he had bene raised frō death to life, wherewith certaine Ladies her kynswomen, assistinge her dolorous di∣stresse, hauyng restored her laste traunce, and doubtyng eft∣sones to fal into the like passion, sent for their husbādes with other the frends of MONTANYNO, aswel to reioyce his hap∣pie deliuery & so to auoyde al occasiōs of further traunces in his sister, as also to excuse their negligēce in not assisting his late miserie: but CHARLES dissimuling yt which he thought of their discourtesie towardes himself, gaue thē chief thākes for their frendship in cōforting his syster, which he cōstrued to as great an honor & argumēt of good wil, as if they had im∣ployed it on ye behalf of himself, wherwith he dismissed them, deuining notwithstāding what he shold be that had made so large declaratiō of so great a vertu, & sorowful without mea¦sure that he knew him not, to thende he might not onely re∣quie so rare a courtesie, but also excede him in liberalitie by a franke offer of himself & al that he hath within the world: he scamed not so ignoraunt of thauthor of so greate a bene∣fit, as his syster in treble doubte on ye same behalf, persuading
herselfe notwithstanding that the feare of death had made him cōueigh a secret sale of his landes in the cōtrey to him which first broked it. And that this doubte which seamed to trouble hym was onely a darke vaile to conceile the trothe and kepe it from her knowledge, or rather his longe imprisonment with disquiet of minde duringe his trouble, had stalled his sences & made him raue in yt sorte, wherin she was in equall doubte of them al, til he resolued her to the contrary, where∣with departing for that night, they repaired to their seueral chābers, where ye MONTANYN had more desier of slepe, then hable to admit any rest, for that he spent al that night in con¦templatiō & contrarietie of thoughtes, making an assemblie in his minde of euery shape & figure of such his frends as he was hable to imagin to be ye workers or cause of so great a be¦nefit, somtime preferring one, somtime presēting an other, without touching notwithstāding ye perfect whit, or naming him that iustely had deserued the meede of so great a merite, and to whome he acknowledged no lesse bonde of dutie then Parents. to them that were the first causers of his comming into this worlde, wherin passing that night the pictures of a thousand men, his bed seamed to serue him as a wyde & large plaine, or some rowmey alley or close arbor within a thicke wood to rol vp and downe, making his discourse with sondry sortes of diuerse ymaginations, vntil the discouerynge of the redde globe orforronner of the day somoned APOLLO to harnesse his horse & begin his course ouer our HEMISPHERE, whē he rise and wente to the officer of the fyske, of whome he de∣maunded to know what he was that discharged the debte of his late forfeyture. He whom you can skarcely ymagin (saith ye receauour) hath exceded all your frends infirme & faithfull zeale towards you, to whom I haue deliuered the releace of your imprisonment, but not ye acquitaūce of ye money, becau∣se here is an ouerplus which I haue here to tēder vnto you, wt your general discharge, wherwt Charles no lesse moued a∣gainst him for ye offer of ye money, then greued wt the curious delay he seamed to vse in disclosing ye name of so great a frēd,
requested hym eftesones to cut of his suspence, & make hym know ye man to whom he was so much bounde. The rare ver tue & curtesie of ANSEAMO SALIMBINO (saith he) hath pre¦ferred cause of perpetual shame to al your frendes & allies, and opened you the waye not onelye to be equall, but ex∣cede hym in semblable merit, wherewith he departed with an infynity of conceiptes and constructions of the courtesie of his enemye, and beynge at his house in a secret gallerye voyde from all companye or occasion of disturbance, began to discourse diuerslye of thaccident, but chiefly what shoulde sturre vp such generositie with inexspectable humanitie in hym, who with his parentes and all the power he mighte make, had bene the onely and mortall scourges of his whole house, at last startyng vp (as it were out of a dead sleape or newly delyuered from the misterye of som sodaine qualme) began to remember some glées of frendshy, which he had heretofore noted in SALIMBINO on the behalfe of his sy∣ster, which appeared chiefly in the often palewalkes & pur∣menades he made by the gate of hys Pallais, where yf by chaūce his eyes encoūtred with the viewe of ANGELIQVA, he forgot not to preferre a reuerence and salutacion rather of an affectioned hart, then a mynde charged with grudge or any kinde of enymitie, wheruppon he resolued immediatly that the onelye beautye of his syster did pleade for his lyfe, and purchase his deliuerye, concludyng withall in his mind, The noble harte soonest enclined to loue. that as ye noble hart is soonest enclined to loue, so when true affection hath once made a breache into the intralles of the valyant and princely minde, it is impossible but she shoulde expose maruelous effectes and fruites of honest vertue, like as also the ymp deriued of noble kinde, and discended of the progenie of renowmed predecessours, can not so maske or co¦uer his norriture & education, but the vertue of the minde wil aduaunce herselfe in the countenance with shew of no∣bilitie in the face, and preferre a facilitie in that, whiche the voice of the worlde hath not onelye iudged impossible, but also absolutely persuaded that he wold neuer be brought
to do it, eyther of frée consent or force of any awe or allure∣mentes, wherin for his parte because he would neyther be surmounted in honestie nor noted of anye spot of ingrati∣tude determined to reuenge the good tourne he had receiued with suche prodigall recompense, that he woulde seame no lesse liberall in retorninge thintereste of the benefit recey∣ued, then the other treble meritorious for thexample of soo rare a vertue, wherefore hauinge nothinge worthy to pre∣sent the frendshipp of SALIMBINO, but himselfe and his sister, determined to impart his present resolution with the fayre ANGELIQVA, and after dispose themselues by mutu∣all assent to make a tender & franke offer of that whych was in theym, to be imployed on the behalfe of him and his as he lyste to ymagine the occasion, wherin because he was now in the contrey without intent to retourne to the citie till the expiracion of some iiij. or v dayes, CHARLES, fynding hys conscience heauelye charged with a debte on his behalfe, thought to practise for hym in his absence, aswell as he was myndefull of his late misfortune, and therupon procured his syster into a gardein far from anye haunte or companye to troble them, where he brake with her in this sort, Amongest all the chaunges and conuersions of mortall af∣faires Montanyno seketh to re quit the good torne of his enemye. (my deare syster) there is none a more familiar prece∣dent of the malice of fortune, then he that is touched wyth di¦uersitie of euils, nor anye so greate a paterne or example of her mobitie, as they that fynde often chaunge of estate, and yet for all that, we ought not to suffer any aduersatie to deminishe the vertue and constancie of the mind, neyther is it our part to geue so greuous a sentence of the state of mās mortalitie, as eyther to denie mercie to such as be in misery or dispair of compassion whenne our selues be touched with affliction, seing that as thinges mortall are full of chaunge, Fortune not to be holden against her vvil, and god is bound to no time. and no man hath perpetuall felicitie, So there is no man certaine of any thinge that he hath, and God is bound to no time, and fortune being slipperie of her selfe, and not hable to be holden againste her will, dothe neuer giue so greate
felicitie, but she enioyneth a double penaunce with trouble of treble annoy in respect of the benefyt. And besides he that falleth frō the vttermost spray, or height of the highest tree, findeth lesse case and more daunger, then suche as fele them selues taken from the lowe and shallow braunches suppor∣ted vpon the firme earth. Al which I prefer vnto you in this place aswel by a peculyar instigacion and remorce of mynde restoring a newe remembrance of the noble cōdicion of our Auncestors, the auncient glory of our race, and former re∣nowne of the house of MONTANYNO, as also to sturre vp in vs both a freshe supplie of sorowful teares on the behalfe of the late depopulation and vtter ruine of the same: wher∣in for my parts, as often as I beholde the riche seates and stately buildinges, somtime the resident and ordinarie pla∣ces of abode of our fathers and grandfathers: when my de∣solate eyes glaunsinge vpon diuers corners of this cytie, do fede vpon the viewe of sondrye skutchions and pendels of our armes bearinge a special marke or badge of thantiqui∣tie of our famuly, or that in the cathedral churches or chiefe temples of this cytie I peruse the inscription of so manye statelye tombes and perpetuall monumentes of marble, shrowdyng the bodies of so many noble Knightes and nota∣ble Captaines discended of the lyne of MONTANYNO: but chieflye as often as I put my foote within the entrey of this pallais (the very reste and last remeinder of them whose au∣thoritie onely hath earst gouerned the state of this common¦welth), I fele my selfe so passioned with inward grefe, and my hart within distillinge drops of blodd on the behalfe of so great a desaster, that I wishe more often then I am harde to be taken awaye from the dolourous regarde of suche wret∣ched desolation, to thende that I alon mighte not liue as the od relike or vttermost reste of our subuerted house. And al∣beit we may chalēge the first place in the beadrol of vnhappy wretches, seinge our fortune hath exchaunged oure aun∣cient felicitie, for a present lyfe of extreme miserye, yet yf there be anye cause of consolation in aduersitie, we haue
raison to ioye in the condicion of our state, chefly for that we are not iustely to be charged with imputacion of euil or dis∣honest trade any waie, and that notwithstanding the raging malice of our fortune with the force of pouertie pinchynge extremely, the discourse of our lyues hath so confirmed the generositie of our auncestors, that we kepe the consent of al voices, to be nothing inferior to the best of them in any re∣spect of vertue or showe of true nobilitie: For I haue al∣waie indeuored to obserue this one rule & discipline of the re nowmed Emperour & captaine MARCVS ANTHONIVS, who persuadeth that as the heyght of estate ought not to al∣ter Height of e∣state ought not to alter the goodnes of nature. the goodnes of nature: So the frowarde disposition of fortune oughte not to take awaye or diminishe the constan∣cie of the mynde, with this addicion that he beareth her ma∣lice best that hydes his myserye moste: Besides thusmuche dare I aduouche of my selfe, that as I was neuer presented with the offer of any good tourne, whiche I haue not thanke∣fullie requited to thuttermoste: So I haue not bene a ni∣garde of anye thinge I haue on the nedefull behalfe of my frende or other companion, detestynge alwayes that anye iote of ingratitude shold staine the reputatiō wherin I haue lyued hytherunto: For as amongest a nomber of vices in men nowe a dayes, the note of vnthanfulnes is no lesse de∣testable then anye of the reste: So for my parte I wishe the rigour of THATHENYANS lawe vpon hym, who seames The Atheni∣ans punished vnthākfulnes by death. eyther forgetfull of the benefyt passed, or vnthankefull to the frendship of hym that brought succours to his necessitie when he dispaired of relief: wherin (my deare sister) albeit you maye happelye imagine the cause of this longe circun∣staunce, yet can you giue no certeine iudgement of the ende or conclusion, nor diuine ryghtely the meanynge of the mi∣sterye whiche I purpose to reueale vnto you. The threat∣nynge perill whiche earste houered to cut in sonder the fyl∣let of my lyfe, is of so late a tyme, that I am sewer youre minde hath not yet dismissed the remembraunce of so feare∣full a tragedye, neyther haue you forgotten I knowe howe
as it were by speciall miracle, I was boughte out of the han∣des of the executioner of iustice and redemed from the rigo∣rus sentence of the partiall senatt, without thassistance of any my parentes or alyes, by eyther simple offer of worde or effect: wherin as I am warned by this experience not onlye to putt small confidence in anye of my kynsmen hereafter, but also to reappose no assurance at all in their flatteringe show of fained face, so I haue tasted of so great a pleasure at the handes of hym who neuer deserued well of mee, nor I cause to ymagyne any one droppe of humanitye in hym on my behalfe, that yf I do ryght to his vertue, I haue reason to admitt hym not onlye amonge the felowshippe, but also the firste and chiefe of my deare frendes: for beinge pressed so muche wyth the iniquitte of the tyme, wyth freshe assaltes of newe afflictions, and forsaken with all of my nearest fren∣des, I had reason to ymagyne, and cause to feare that thonly malice of oure mortall enemyes (for the extirpation of the whole stocke and roote of oure race) had bene the workers of my laste trouble and daunger of deathe: But (good syster) in this distruste I haue abused the vertue of our late aduersary deseruynge to indure pennance for entringe into conceites of conspiracye agaynste hym, whose late benefyte (excedinge the ymaginacion of all men) hath made me bounde to honor the remembrance of his name with a debte of dutie so longe as nature shall phan in mee the breathe of lyfe: for in place where I feared most daunger, I founde moste sauetie, and where I exspected least sewertye, I encowntred moste assu∣rance, And that hande whiche I attended only to giue the fa∣tal blowe of my destruction, hath not only remoued all occa∣sions or offers of present perill, but become the chiefest pil∣lor and proppe of mine honour and lyfe hereafter, wherin be¦cause you shalbe partaker of the playnnesse of my tale, as∣well as you haue vsed patience in the hearinge of the circum¦stance, yt is ANSEAMO SALYMBYNO the son and heir of our aunciente persecutours, who hath made so manyfeste a declaration of his affected zeale towardes our howse, that in
taking your brother owte of the handes of thunrighteous senate & present daunger of perentorye destruction, he hath seamed so lauishe of his liberal mynde, that in place of vii. C florentes, he hath paide a thousande Duckattes for the ran∣som of hym, who iudged hym the moste crewell enemye of the worlde: what argumente of noble harte is this or howe seldom dothe a man encounter suche rare frutes of vertue? frendes knitt together by a speciall league of amytie or mu∣tuall vowe of frendeshippe, do oftentymes make the worlde wonder of the sondry frutes and effectes of constancie which appeareth betwene theime: but where the mortall enemie, beinge neyther reconciled nor required nor demaundinge any assuraunce for the pleasure he dothe, paieth not only the debte of his aduersarye, but restoreth his state when hee is at pointe to performe the last of his fatal somaunce I thinke it excedes all the consideration of suche as vse to discourse vppon the doinges of menne. I knowe not what title to geue to the acte of SALYMBYNO, nor howe to tearme this his curtesye, yf not that his doinges deserue a better meede thenne the renowne of DAYMON and PITHIAS or other moste loyall frendes whome the writters doo fauor wyth suche surnames of glorye: but as I am a chiefe wit∣nes of hys vertue, so the example of hys presente honestie hathe sturred vppe suche an affected humor wythin me that eyther I wyll dye in thindeuor, or els I wylbe equall yf not hable to excede hym in the retourne of hys liberalitie, wherein beinge iustelye bownde to engage the beste parte in me, for the recompense of that good torne whiche gaue increase to my lyfe, I am to craue a special assistance of you (Syster) for the complotte of the deuise whyche I haue al∣readye ymagyned and fullye resolued to performe to thend I maye bee onelye bownde to you for thacquitaunce of the liberalytye of SALIMBINO, by whose helxe you that earste Lamented the losse of libertye and lyfe of youre bro∣ther maye nowe congratulate hys healthe and happye dely∣uerye: where wyth the faire ANGELIQVA fully resolued
by this laste report of her brother, that it was SALEMBINO whyche hadde surmounted all her parentes and frendes in the delyuerye of her onelye confort, and consolacion of their whole howse, made a frank promyse of her ayde in this sort: like as (saith she) I was neuer hable to ymagyne yt your dely¦uery was wrought by so Rare a meane, nor yt our enemyes The ansvver of Augely∣qua to her brother. (dissoluinge the remembraunce of aunciente quarrell) wolde retire to a care and conseruacion of the healthe and lyfe of the MONTANYNS: euen so I thinke youre debt is the greater by the awthoritie of him that hathe done the benefyte, and more worthye of am ple consideracion, thenne if the good torne hadde bene don by any of your parentes and allies: for thymitacion of a vertue oughte to excede the ex∣ample of the awthor, chieflye wher thoccasion is deryued of suche an vnlikelihod, that the compasse of brayne seames insufficiente to ymagine so verteous an acte, wherin for my parte, if I were as hable as I am willinge, his curtesye, shoulde bée retorned at soo large an intreste, that hymselfe shoulde thinke his benefyt nothinge in respecte of the recompence, and the worlde to witnes the generositie of the MONTANYNS, but hauynge no waye thassistaunce of fortune to presente him with any thinge that may ballance with the merite of hys curtesye, and beinge besides a maide withoute accesse to his house, by reason of the smal hawnte I vse with the ladyes his kinswomenne, I can do no more but yelde honoure to hys vertue wythe secrete thankes in my harte, wythe acknowledginge the debte vntill wee bee hable to discharge it wyth equall recompense: albeit (brother) if you haue deuised the meane wherin you accompte mee necessarye to be ymploied, doubte not of mee in anye respecte, soo that myne honoure onely bee not dis∣tressed. Amongeste ann infinitte discourses appearynge seuerallye in my vnquiette mynde (saythe hee) I canne not reste vppon anye likelye cause or meane to worke theffecte of soo Rare a curtesye in thys gentlemanne on
my behalfe, nor to procure hym in soo soddayne a mo∣mente to breake the bonde of annciente grudge, and to conuerte his naturall hate into a frendeshippe withoute a seconde or comparison, if it be not the fyer of a couert loue kindled of longe time within the tender parts of his intrails, and suppressed with a wonderfull greife to himself, til now, that encountringe so conueniente an occasion to sette abroache the vessell of his burninge desier, withe meane to euente the flame that wyll no longer smother, but bulke out into open show, he makes open declaracion of that whiche he can no longer conceile: ah wonder full force and vertue in loue, who hath power to conuerte the minde oppressed wt passion of collor into a disposition tractable beyo nd all exspec¦tacion, and in one momente to chaunge that wherein all mē iudged an ympossibylitie of conuercion, it is only thy bewtie ANGELYQYA with respect of other thy perfections whiche Loue hathe povver to vvorke a faci¦litie in that vvhiche all men thinke ympossible. haue transformed our late enemye into the parson of a per∣fecte frende, it is the generall ame of thy honest and verte∣ous life yt hath sommoned SALYMBYNO to deliuer thy mi∣serable brother abandoned of all his frendes and in dispaire of any good fortune, Oh, noble gentleman and harte of a kinge lackinge no kinde of magnanymitie, what meanes a∣las haue 3 to approche that honest liberalitie wherunto thou haste bownde me by so sewer obligacion? I lyue to serue the and am ready to dye to do the pleasure? mine honor is reser∣ued to be ymploied by the, and my goodes and lyuinge at∣tende thy sommonce to dispose of them at thy pleasure, thow haste also made suche a stealthe of my harte that onely death is hable to redeme it, what is there thenne remaininge, but that yu ANGELIQVA, remoue incontynent the vaile of al su∣persticion, and vnseamely crueltie in disposinge thy selfe to be thankefull to hym who hath won thy goodwill by the wager and warranty of verteous loue, and who as a fyrste earneste penny of his seruice and dutye towardes the, dyd presente a thousande ducekettes for the raunsome of myne
honour and lyfe, whyche if they remeyne of equall care vnto the nowe, as thabundance of thy late teares with dollorus regardes did earste argue to all the worlde, whereof also thou gaueste a chiefe declaration in thy free consente to se mine inheritance for the redemption of my thraldom: Sticke not to dispose thy selfe now so frankely on my behalfe, that I maye reuenge the fauor whiche SALYMBYNO hath don me (for the respect of thy loue) with a present no lesse preci∣ous and rare, then his acte is iustly meritorious of perpetu¦all fame in all ages: And as hee refuced not turne vp the bottom of his coffers to raunsome my libertie: So lackinge the consente of equal fortune to retorne his curtesye with semblable payment, lett vs make a present of your bewtie, whiche I am sewer he wil not abuse any waye, consydering that he wantes no furniture of vertue whiche is necessarie for the adorninge of a noble harte, which as it is al the meane I haue to make a counterchange of his benefytt, and bringe me out of debt with him whose money lyethe in pawne for the libertie of my life: So I beseche you (good sister) consider the iustice of my requeste and prono wnce a resolucion in suche sorte, as requitinge that whiche is due to him, I maye yelde you alone al homage and holde my life only of you: but if your aunswere putt me eyther in doubte or dis∣paire of this meane to make euen with so true a creditor, as∣sure your selfe I wil rather abandon both citye and countrey and disclaime the company of al my frends, then liue amon∣gest you with the name of an vnthankeful parson, or be poin¦ted at of the worlde not to requite so great a good torne as the deliuerie and sauinge of my life, wherefore seinge that in you alone consistes the whole reappose of your desolate bro∣ther, determine eyther his abode and companye with you for euer, or els his departure within these thre daies, to wast the remeinder of his wretched life in continual wander in forreine soiles, with absolute intente neuer to sett foote within any parte of ITALY hereafter. Wherwith the pore ANGELIQVA became no lesse astonied and voyede of sence
then if she had bene of a soddayn assailed wt an APOPLEXIE al be it the passion of her mynde quarrellinge so longe with in that her stomake seamed to pant as it were the brea∣the of it, litle bellowes vpon a fordge, brake oute at laste by a watery vent at her eyes distillinge whole riuers of tea¦res, and restored her to the vse of her speche, which she vt∣tered to her brother in this sorte. I haue often rede (saithe shee) that it is easye for an innocente to fynde wordes to speake, and verye harde for a man in myserie to kepe a tem∣peraunce in his tale, but I doubte I shall finde by a present experience of my selfe, that the defence of a prisoner is not only superfluous but also hatefull seaminge rather to re∣proue then enforme the iudge, wherein I am the rather per¦swaded (my deare brother) for that the tearmes of thy laste requeste dependinge vpon yssues of extremeties, do argue bothe a iustice to performe thy desyer and an incyuilitie in the in makinge so vnreasonable a demaunde, the one chalen∣ginge a consente in me by thympression of nature and bonde of dutifull zeale on my behalfe towards the, the other char¦ginge the wyth iniquitie for the respecte of that whiche thou wouldest haue me to do: But seinge euerye requeste craueth a retorne of aunswere, and the greater qualytie or condition the cause is of, the greater delyberacion oughte wee to vse, iefelye where it ymportes eyther thabsolute breache or firme confirmation of the league of lyneall con∣sanguynitye: I beseche you graunte no lesse patience to the wordes of my replie, then I haue bene contented to fauor your vehement protestacion with a dollorous scilence, ney∣ther let me any longer inveighe in myne aunswere, then I shall seame to preferre good reason to iustefye my iuste com∣plaint, the cause wherof doth marche with more alarams of annoye thorow all the partes in me, then if I wer present∣ly pinched with the most greuous tormentes of the worlde: seing that my life, with therposition of the same is nothing in respecte of that which thy ymportunities do labour to set
abroche and put in vent for the onely satisfaction of a prodi∣gall liberalitye: for if the price of my life woulde suffice for the raunsom of myne honor, and appaisement of thy appetit, thou couldest no soner ymagyn thy contentement, then the same shoulde be exposed on thy behalfe, neyther wolde I take halfe the tyme to performe it which I haue vsed in making yt the promise I thought alas the late delyuery of my brother, had brought to vs all an vndowted dispense of further trou∣ble, and that he had buryed in the pitt of his ymprysonmente all occasions of further disquiette: And who wolde haue iud∣ged, but in the laste assalte and vniuste offer of vndeserued deathe, fortune had spitt the vttermoste of her poysened ma∣lice, and that in deuestinge herselfe frome the theatrye or throane of rigorous crueltie, she had also broken in peces the bloddye arrowes wherewith of so longe time shee hathe persecuted our desolate howse & pronounced trewyce at last to the wearye miferies of the wretched state of the MON∣TANINS But alas vnhappie creature that I am I fynde nowe our destenie is rather deferred, then our miserye at an end, seing yt that vniuste goddes of vnworthy reuenge and moste cruell stepmother inuadinge mee wythe more fury then affore doth threaten my yonge and tender yeares with more perentorye plages, then euer shee thondred vppon any of my former race: for if euer shee pursewed oure fathers graundefathers or anye predecessours with mortall afflic∣tion, or intente of vtter ruyne, it is nowe shee hathe cho∣sen her tyme to put to her laste hande to the extreame extir∣pacion of the miserable reliques and remeyndor of oure pore house, eyther by the wilfull losse and perpetuall exile of ye my deare brother or vntymely death of thy dysolate ANGELIQVA, who canne not make prostitucion of her chastetye wythout the sacrafyce and oblation of her misera∣ble life: what is destenye if this be not the consent and iud∣gement of the heauens, wt resolutiō to subplāt ye stock & gra∣tes of our house, seing yt I a simple girle wtout force voide of
assistance of age or experience, is constrained to admytt th one of two euils, whereof the choise oughte and is hable to amase the moste wise and experienced creature that this day enioyeth the benefytt of mortall life, alas my harte faileth me, and reason (forsaken and flede from me) hath lefte my minde ballauncinge in suche confucion and contraryetie of thoughtes, that beinge broughte to thertremetye of two distresses of equall perill and indifferente terror, I doubte whether to cōmit my life to shorte and sharppe penaunce or prolonge my dayes in pyninge dollor, and secrete care of minde: for the sentence which thou haste pronounced of both our estates, is eyther to make a seperation by extreme exile of my brother, who is no lesse deare in my harte then the ten drest part of myne eye, and in whom nexte after GOD I haue reposed the whole assuraunce of my hope and consolacion of life, or els in conseruinge him, I see my selfe at pointe to bee constrained to make marchandise (I can not tell in what sorte nor for what price) of that precious treasure, whiche once loste, is not to be reclaimed by any meanes, and for the garde wherof al women of vprighte minde honoring vertue or desierous of reputacion, oughte rather to expose theimselues to a thousande mortal perilles and hazardes of deathe, if nature and life were hable to abide soo manye en∣cownters, then to suffer one spotte of infamie to staine or corrupt this precious ornament and gifte of chastitie, which as it is the only support and decoration of ye life of an honest woman, so for a contrarye, she that loseth the possession of so riche a Iewel, or deuesteth her selfe of the title and crown of so great a glorye, althoughe she seame to liue and kepe place amonge other creatures, yet is she dead in effecte and her life recorded in the booke of blacke defame as a witnes againste herselfe in the latter days, and in the meane tyme a con∣tinual reproch and obiection of shame to such as she leaueth to succede her in kindred or name How can that Lady or gen¦tlewoman marche amongeste the crewe of vertuous da∣mes, whose honor is eyther in doubte or reputacion in
dekaye by the losse of her honour, but that the blod of shamo appearyng in all parts of her face, wil not only discouer her faulte, but makes her wearye of her lyfe by the remorce or remembrance of so foule a forfaiture. How could the dough¦ters of the Emprour AVGVSTVS seame iustly meritorious of the title of true nobilitie, or worthely deserue to be called the children of such a father, after their sondry villaines and lasciuious trade of lyuing, hadd dispoyled them of the giftes and ornamentes of vertue presentyng theim (to the eyes of all the world) as creatures not worthy to haue the common ayre to breath vpon them. what honor hadd FAVSTINA in wearyng the Imperial crowne vpon her head, seyng she had loste the crowne and garlande of chastetie, by her disordred and dishonest life? Sewer she ought not to enioy the breath of lyfe, nor participati with the presence or benefitt of the earth, that makes lesse stoare of her honestie, then of the dea∣reste part belongynge to her soule or bodye: neyther is shée worthie to be admitted amongest the felowshipp of vertues Dames, that departeth with so precious an ornament at o∣ther price then the exchange or loasse of her lyfe, notwith∣standynge the writers of former tyme haue done manifest wronge to diuerse simple women, whose vertue in preser∣uinge their honest name with true title of pudicitie, deser∣ueth rather an euerlastynge remembrance, with notes of vuiuersall prayse in pillers of eternitie, then to be buried without pompe in the tombe of darke obliuion. Ah deare brother what is become of thy auncient generosity and ver∣tue of minde, whych heretofore thou hast exposed on the be∣halfe of the honest & chast Ladies of thy kinred & race, haste thou conuerted that care and curious zeale, whiche hyther∣vnto all men haue noted in the on my behalfe, into a present intent to take awaye my lif, & renowme after my death? be∣cause thy peruersed fortune hath depriued the of the moste part of thy possessions & liuinges, wilt thou therfore that I make lyke sale of min honor, whyche I haue kepte hether∣vnto with so greate watche and diligence? wilte thou (my
deare brother that ANSEAMO do triumphe with more glory in the victorie of my virginity, then if he had cōstrained the rest & remeinder of our miserable race to passe by the edge of his mordrynge sworde? Remember alas that the hurtes and diseases of the soule be farre more vehement and of a contrary disposition to them which afflict & annoy the body, And is it I vnhappie & thryswretched girle that must do pe∣naūce for thoffences of vs all? is this the iustice of the gods, or rigorous dome of my angry destinies: if ye heauens haue resolued my ruine, why do they not rather cōmitt me to fa∣tal execution, thē present me vpon the Alter of fylthie ymo∣lacions or offrings to the deuouring goddesse of filthie lust, Venus. and that to appease the appetit of a young man, who perad∣uenture desiereth no other pray then ye spoiles of my honor? How pappie was the noble VIRGINIA of Rome, who was slaine by the hādes of her owne father, to auoyde violaciō of her bodye by ye lasciuious Emprour APPIVS the cōmon ene∣mie to the honor & reputacion of al honest Ladies? alas why staith my brother to purchasse like renowme by performing semblable execution vpō me, rather then of his owne mind, to become the infamous minister of my life readye to abide the daunger of dishoneste force, if God become not the pro∣tectour of his seruant, & take my cause into his hande? why dothe death deferre to do his dutie, or staye to dip the end of his venemous dart in the congeiled blod of my dieng sprit, & dispatch me with spede to visit the shadowes of my happy predecessours, who vnderstanding my present distresse, can not be voyde (I am sewer) of passion on ye behalfe of my wret¦ched extremety? why did not God & nature giue power to the midwyf to smother me at thinstant that her cursed handes, receiued me from the wombe of my mother, rather then in preseruyng my lyfe with the milke of tender norriture, to make my youth subiect to sondry sortes of affliction, & now in the age & exspectation of quiet to present me the choice of ij. of the most mortall euils in the world? what councel haue I to assiste me in so doubtefull a case: or whiche waye can I tourne me, where I am not indifferently assailed with re∣morse
on the behalf of my brothers request, & shame with de∣speracion in the simple remembrance of the fact? Alas shall I loase him whom nature and law of kinde, haue named the one halfe of my selfe, and to cōmit theffect of his demande, is no lesse dampnable afore God, then if I did violence & force against my selfe with mine own handes, neyther haue I re∣medie or reason to eschew either of theis euils, but by thassi∣stance of the oh cruel Attropos whom I besech with the laste teares of this complaint to whet thy fatall knif, and shred in sonder with spede ye twyst of my wretched daies, least in pre∣uentinge thy slacknes or slender haste, theis handes of mine vndertake to supplie thine office with vnnaturall reuenge of my present sorow, wherewith her teares & sighes ceassed vpon a sodaine, and her tounge foltering in her mouth, her complexion of face was also conuerted into a pale & ghastlye regard, in suche sorte as the passion of this traunce, stopping Angeliqua falleth into a sound. the conduites and course of her breath, she seamed to haue as litle féeling or show of lyfe as the seat wheron she sat, which when CHARLES behelde, with resolution that the misterie conteined neither vision nor dreame, nor charme of deceit, but that his syster had bene as vtterly without hope of reco∣uery, as she seamed senceles and without breath: ouercome with dolor and dispair to lyue after her whome he onely had preferred to so wretched a death, fel vpon a sodaine from the place wher he sat vpon the grounde, without mouing either hand or foote: the noise of whose fal restored ANGELIQVA, to some litle rebalation and vse of breath, recouerynge in like sorte the opening of her eyes, with a general mocion and fée∣lyng in al her parts, & being thus at libertie of frée conside∣racion, her eyes disclosed immediatly the piteous estat of her brother, whom she iudged now to haue deliuered her of fur∣ther care to performe his requeste, wherein seing a gene∣rall retire of all his sences, and onelye viewe of his deade bodie remeynynge to encrease her doloure, she stoode at the point to vse the same reuenge of her selfe, that THIS BE dyd when she founde her frende dead: but finding
his bodye warme, wyth some argument of recouerye, she forgat not the vse of any medecine, wherin she iudged vertu to reclaime life, and falling with all flat vpon the body of her deade brother, shée began to curse her fortune, and accuse the starres of crucltie, inueighing withal against the slēder frendship of her selfe towardes hym who made no cōscience to offer to dye to preserue his patriimonie and inheritaunce only for her sustentation, in the ende by thapplicatiō of cer∣teine medecines and odoriferous smels, somtime sprinkling colde water vpō his face, dropping viniger into his mouth, and somtime rubbynge his temples and pulses, wyth other sleightes to reuoke hym that is but halfe dead, she brake the bed of his traunce, openyng a vent to vtter the course of his breath, wherewith also his eys disclosed, and chalenged their wonted lyght, beholdinge with dolefull regardes, his desolate syster, who seinge all his partes replenished eft∣sones with vital mocions, that he was in case to vnderstand and gyue iudgement of her wordes, sayed vnto hym: seinge my mishap is so great, that she will admit no dispense of her malice, & thou deare brother so whollie resolued in thy wil∣ful imagination, that I must yelde to thy somance & become the minister of the sentence of thy harte, more prodigall and bountiful then is conuenient by the consent of raison, I am content to become thankefull accordyng to thy desyer, and more readye to performe thy requeste, then thou haste rai∣son to eracte so muche vppon me, wherefore do awaye thy desperat regardes, and lookes not vnliket o him that is plun¦ged in a passion of tremblyng feare, receyuynge with glad∣nes the present offer of thy carefull syster, who here pre∣sentes herselfe the handemaide of thy will, gyuynge the ful Angeliqua consenteth to her brothers requeste. commission to dispose of this pore carkasse at thy pleasure, & make a present of it to suche as thou accomptes thy selfe so greatly indebted vnto: only I am to warne the of one thing, wherin thou canst not note me of any mislike by iustice, be∣cause ye integritie & vertue of my intent defends me frō im∣putacion yt waye, & which asso I giue the absolute assurance
to performe, that is, being once discharged of thy authoritie, thou shalt vse no more power to restraine me frō doinge the thing which my minde hath alredye decreed, protesting vnto the by the right hande of hym that gouerneth the vniuersal globe, that as no man shal touch ANGELIQVA, but in sorte & order of mariage, so if I be committed to a further force thou & al the worlde shal perceiue that I haue a hart wil en∣harden thies handes to make a sacrifice of my life to the cha∣stetie of those noble Ladyes, whiche heretofore haue rather desyred to dye, then liue with a note of infamie or dishonour: for as my soule shal neuer stande in hazarde of grace, by the villany of any acte which my bodye shal commit by free con∣sent, euen so if this carkasse be forced to violacion, I doubte not but the integritie of my minde wil purchasse a priuiledg againste all purgatorie of my soule, witnessing in the other worlde myne innocencie and inuincible hart: wherewith she renewed the alaram of her sorowe, with a freshe supplie of sodaine teares, with suche abundaunce and impetuositie of dule, that a man woulde haue thoughte, that the whole hu∣mour and moyste partes of her braine had bene drained and dried vp by the surges of continuall teares whiche ceassed not to fal frō her waterie eyes: her brother for his part, albe∣it he greued with the desolation of his chaste syster, yet the oye he conceiued in her present consent to his demaunde, toke awaye the passion of that sorowe, felynge (as it were) some secret instinct or fore warnyng of the happye successe & effect of the liberal offer of ANGELIQVA, to whom he excu∣sed his importunitie in some sorte after this maner, I was neuer so gredie of life (saith he) but I could be content rather to renounce nature and dye, then to solicite the in any res∣pect, whiche mighte bringe thy honor or reputacion in pe∣ril of infamous interest, neyther would I lyue to se and muche lesse be partaker of the thinge that anye waye sea∣mes to tourne thee to displeasure: whiche thou shouldest alwayes haue founde by effect and touche of finger, if this li∣berall curtesye of our enemye had not procured me to wrest
the to that which honestie denieth the to graunt & I vnhable to demaunde without great wronge to thy vertue, & no lesse preiudice to mine owne honor. And as the feare I haue to be noted of ingratitude, hath taken away al respects of honor or honestie to vs both, so the vertue & noble hart of ANSEAMO doth not only offer an assured argumēt of hope, but also pre∣sentes absolute cause of firme belefe, that the only displea∣sure thou shalte finde in this enterprise will appeare when thou art firste presented vnto him: For it is not possible he shold vse villany on the behalfe of her, the onely regarde of whose loue hath made him make no cōscience to hazarde the displeasure of his parents & chief frendes, not refusing with∣all (without sute or importunitie) to delyuer him whome he hated, & had power to put to what vengeaūce he wold. Here may be noted thoperacion of two extremities of seueral dis∣positions, natural zeale & fraternal dutie, quarellinge wyth womanly shame, & raison mentaining cōtencion with in her self. ANGELIQVA knewe & cōfessed that her brother dyd no more then he oughte, & that she was also leuiable to the same bond & obligation of dutie, and on the other part thestimaciō of her honor with regard to defende her chastetie, supplāted such dutifull respectes of nature, & forced her to an integritie of iudgement, in that which she accompted both vniust & vn∣lawful, wherupon resoluing to obserue both the one and the other, & seame chiefly to be thankeful to the demande of her brother, determined to discharge him of the debte towardes his long enemy & late frend, with intent notwithstāding ra∣ther to die by the stroake of her owne handes then villanous∣ly to loase the flower of that which made her lyue famous, & of greater renowme then the moste part of the ladies of that citie. But the vertue of this SALYMBINO is of more rare singularitie & deserueth a greater cōmendacion, then the con¦tinencie of CYRVS sometime king of PERSIA, who ering a force of inysement to lorke vnder the flattering beautie of the faire and common PANTEA wold neuer suffer her to be brought to his presence, leaste her wanton regardes shoulde
make him abuse the renowme of his aunciēt honor, & breake the sacred deuociō which all men ought to vse in mariage, wt violacion of his faith confirmed by former vowe to his wyfe: For ANSEAMO enioyeng the presence, with free cōmande∣ment ouer her whom he loued no lesse then his owne life, did not only abstaine to abuse the bountiful gifte of his fortune, but also declared an effect of more nobilitie & vertue of mind, then ye saied CYRVS, as you may note in the next acte of this historie attēding his present discouerie: for as the Montanyn & his sister had deuided their deliberaciō into certaine points with abrigement at laste of their longe discourse, & that the faire ANGELIQVA had staied the source of her teares with expectatiō of the ende of that which they had but nowe begō, ANSEAMO repaires from the contrey to his pallais in the towne, wherof at viij. of the cloke in the euening Don Charles receiued aduertisement, and without delaye of further time willed his sister to attire her selfe in the best order she could, with whom and onely one man (to cary a lanterne of slender lighte) they went to the lodging of SALIMBYNO, whose seruant by chaunce encountred them at the pallais gate of his maister, not without astonishment to see them there with desier to speake with Seigneur Salymbyno, who vnderstā∣ding what companie the MONTANYN brought with hym, was not forgetful for his part to discende with expediciō ha∣uīg caried afore him .ij. stafftorches, geuing light til he came euen to the gate, where omitting no kinde of curtesye in re∣ceauing ye brother, he was barred (as it seamed) to expose any shew of seruice on the behalfe of her whom he chiefly desiered to honor, but standing (as it were a mā enchaunted or some Hermit in expectation to heare the aunswere of his oracle) was no lesse astonied with the viewe of his newe gestes then if he had sodainly dropped out of the cloudes, which cōfusion & trouble of mind was immediatly espyed of DON CHAR∣LES, who as he imagined without great studie, that the pre∣sence & beautie of his sister sturred vp ye perplexitie of Salym∣byno, so he went about to breake ye amaze with theis wordes: Syr, saith he, we haue cause of speciall conference with
you whiche requireth neyther publike audience nor other witnes then our selues, wherewith he offred them his cham∣ber and became their guide thither with more shew of dutie, then desiere to be intreated, and leading his deare ANGELI∣QVA by the hande, passed thorowe the hal into a certaine gal∣lerie, furnished with riches and accotrementes belonginge to the greatnes of his estate, where beinge set in rich thaires and seates of honor, and the place voyde of all companie, sa∣uynge, the presence of the ij. simple clyentes, and mercifull Montanyn to Seigneur Sa∣lymbyno. iudge, DON CHARLES MONTANYNO rise frō his place, and spake to thother in this sorte. Albeit the offers of serui∣tude be alwayes moste hatefull to freemen, and that the no∣ble hart can hardly brooke to strike sayle for any sommance of aduersitie, yet the bonde of a good tourne or benefyt al∣redy don, leuieth such alarams of remorce to the mynde en∣uironned with vertue, that she forceth not only an equal cō∣sideracion and recompense, but also claymeth a continuall remembraunce and thankeful recordacion in him, who was firste partaker of the benefyt, wherin as I fynde my selfe spe¦cially touched aboue all that euer was blessed with frendship not looked for in this worlde: So Seigneur SALYMBYNO, I hope you wil excuse me yf in the firste place of my Catalo∣gue of thankesgeuing I honor you, (contrary to the lawes & customes of our common welth) with the title of Lorde and maister, seinge the vertue of your self (declared in the grea∣test distresse that euer hath or coulde happen vnto me) doth not only yelde you, by iustice such title, but also challengeth at my hande a bonde of no lesse dutifull and continuall ser∣uice towardes you, then you expect of the moste drudge and slaue that foloweth your traine, for what disposition is more detestable then the note of vnthankefulnes, or wherin are we bounde to so franke and prodigal an exposition of our selues and all that we haue, as in the remuneracion and re∣tourne of the pleasures we haue receiued by straungers whiche I coulde enlarge with credible authorities of elder dayes, and confirme by familiar experience of our age, sa∣uinge
that in supplienge the tyme with repeticion of anti∣quityes I should defer yet longer the doinge of that, whi∣che I chieflye desyer to performe, but greuinge aboue all thinges that in the viewe and remembrance of their vertues I fynde my selfe farre vnhable to be equall or excede anye that euer were renowmed or noted to be thankefull, where in albeit I haue iuste cause to crye out of the malice of my for tune, not for bringinge me so depely in your debt, (which I thinke was wrought by general consent of the heauens but for that she hath lent me such slender choice of meanes to re∣quite so greate a curtesye, yet in appealinge to the vertue of your mynde, I doubte not to make you vnderstande the greatnes of my desyer, and whether ingratitude bee anye waye harbored in the harte of this poore gentleman, who hauinge but himselfe and the chaste will of his syster, (being both preserued in entier by the onlye assistance of your fauor makes heare a presente of our selues and al that belongeth vnto vs with cōmission (Sir) to dispose of our lyues, lyuin∣ges and honour in any respecte it shall lyke you to ymploye theim. And because I am more then halfe perswaded that thonly respecte of ANGELIQVA hathe kindled the firste coales of your desyer, causing a conuersion of the hate whi∣che discended vnto you by inheritance, into a disposition to loue that whiche your predecessors dispised mortallie, and for that by the heauye clogge of our extreme miserie, and harde condicion of state, wee are not hable to shonne the name of vnthankeful, but by thassistance of her that first procured the debte, she I saye, who forced your liberalitie on my behalfe is heare a readye pawne for the satisfaction of that whiche I confesse to owe vnto you: it is (Sir) my syster whom you see afore you who to absolue the bonde of vs bothe, dothe yelde her selfe vnto you with fre submission of her ho∣noure and lyfe at your pleasure. And I beinge her brother hauinge her ful and free consente in my power, do make you a presente of her, bequeathinge you no lesse propertie then eyther I or she hath of herselfe, with authorytye to dis∣dispose
of her as you thinke good, dowtinge not but you wil accepte the offer, and respecte the gyfte accordinge to the value, with remembrance from whence it came, and in what sorte it ought to be vsed: wherwyth not taryenge the replie of the other nor to bid his syster farewel, he flonge downe the steares, and went ymedyatlye to his owne house: if AN∣SEAMO were indyffrently amased at the firste arryual of bothe the MONTANYNS, or astonnyed with the oracion of her brother, it is nowe that he is double perplexed, both with the soddayn departure of DON CHARLES, and also to see in his presence the effecte of the thinge hee only desyred, and neuer was hable to ymagyn, and muche lesse durste enter into hope to haue it come to passe, wherein as hee was no lesse gladd, then he had cause, beinge in the free contempla∣tion and companye of her whose bewtie and vertue hee ac∣compted aboue the respecte of al commodyties and pleasures of the worlde, So he labored of semblable dollor on the be∣halfe of the passion and secret sorowe of mynde whiche he no¦ted in her touchinge her presente change of estate, the same forcinge him also to a firme perswacion, that thaccidente paste proceded rather of the generosytie or to muche shew of corage and vertue in the harte of the yonge man, then by consente or any contentemente at all to the faire ANGE∣LIQVA, whome at the same instante hee toke betwen his armes and proffringe certeine chaste kysses dryed her wa∣trye eyes of teares whiche ceassed not to droppe with greate abundance, preferringe vnto her this kinde of short consola∣cion. Yf euer I felte or desyred to vnderstande with what wynge dyd flye the vnconstante goddes, whiche the poe∣tes tearme the chaunge and varyetie of thaffaires of the Fortune (ac∣cordinge to the poetes) is the change and alteration of the vvorld ly affayres. worlde, it is nowe (good Madam) that I am presented wyth suche a manifest and strange proofe, that I dare skar∣cely beleue that whiche I see in offer afore myne eyes for if the only respecte of you, and seruice whiche my harte hathe vowed and sworne vnto you, hath constranied me to dissolue the bonde of extreame hate, which by request of my parentes
I haue bene enioyned to beare to you and youre house, and in that deuocion haue delyuered your brother as you knowe from deathe, I see fortune denieth me the tryumphe of the victorye, for that your brother hath surmounted me in ho∣nour and vertue: And nowe do I see that as the flatteringe gle of an vncerteine fortune oughte not to alter the goodnes of the disposition, so aduersitie is not hable to corrupte the vertue of the noble mynde, nor when the good torne is done the memorye of the benefytt is not hatefull to the thankeful man: for albeit my example deserueth cōmendacion, for that I opened the waye and became (as it were) youre brothers guide geuinge the first earnest penny of humanitie betwene vs, yet his ymytacion seames meritorious of treble praise, for that he hath not onely acknowledged my curtesye and re∣torned it wt doble interest, but also laboured to excede me in the true effectes of sincere nobylitie: wherin for your parte beinge my vassal by your owne consente and special gyfte of your brother) al be it you haue more reason of doubte thenne cause to reappose assuraunce in my fydelytie, for that our newe reconcilement is not yet confirmed with any continu∣ance of longe time, nor our amitye iustefied but by one sim∣ple profe or experience of late, yet shal your selfe be iudge & ye whole world witnesse with you, yt my hart is no lesse fre frō corruption, then farre from dishonest or euil intent on your behalfe, and that I pursewe but a consomation of that which GOD hath geuen as a dyuine sacrament and holy law amon∣gest, vs wherfore saith he (with a fresh charg of honest kysses) do away (good ladye) your teares of present dule, and dispaire no more of the perfecte loialtie of your seruaunte who will deale no worse with you hauinge you in his power, then at suche time as he languished on your behalfe and durste not discouer the desyer he had to do you seruice, neither shal your brother repent him of his curtesie, nor you in consentinge to obey him, for albeit you are mine by peculiar graunt & mu∣tual accord, & that your fortune hath geuē me such scoape of authority ouer you that your honor waigheth only in ye bal∣launce of my disposition, yet the respecte of myne owne
reputacion and honour that I owe to youre vertue, dothe defend you from other iniurye at my hande then in making you ye only maistrys of my hart, to craue your cōsent in law∣full mariage and societio of wedlocke whereby thaunciente mutynies and ciuill grudges shall not onlye Retire and rece¦aue ende, but our howses reioyned eftsones with this indis∣soluble bonde of affynitye betwene vs, shal lyue hereafter in contynuall quiet enioyenge a mutuall amytie more firme and stronge on both partes, then the former quarrells were fatal or ful of mortalytie. These newes stayinge the course of wonted teares and dismissinge withal al dollorous argumentes or regardes of sorowe, sturred vppe suche a complexion or dye of natural white and redde in the face of the faire SYENNOYSE that she seamed rather a goddes syttinge in her glistering troane then an ymppe or creature of nature, forcinge suche a ve∣hemencye of desyer in the harte of SALYMBYNO, that he was dryuen eftesones to geue a secōd charg of her goodwil, with a franke offer to make participation vnto her of halfe his liuinge and richesse: wherewyth shee presented hym a semelye reuerence with a maiestye of modestie and woman∣ly behauiour retorninge his request with thanks due to his liberal offer, with further assurance for her part to omit ney¦ther indeuor nor diligence nor declaration of dutie on the be¦halfe of hym whom god hathe reserued for her laweful hus∣bande & companion of bedde, wherewith after they had spent some litle momente in embrasinge one an other and certein kysses giuen and receiued recyprocallye betwene theim, ANSEAMO knocked for an olde awnte of his lyenge in his house to whose charge and fydelytie, he commytted the glo∣rie of his newe conqueste, and fyndinge the leaste momente of delaye greatly hurteful to his desyer dispatched ymediat∣lye seueral messengers to his deare and nearest parentes and frendes, who obeyinge the expedition of his short som¦mance, came ymediatelye vnto his house, where he reques∣ted their assistance of aduise and companye in the consom∣macion
of a busynes of greate importance, wherein if they appered willinge or liked of his request, he seamed (I am se∣wer) to vse aboue an ordinarie seleritie in thexecuiion of his enterprise, & sending for his awnte with her new charge and his deare ANGELIQVA, repaired immediatly (not with oute the greate amaze of his frendes) to the pallaies of the MONTANIN, where skarcely giuinge leaue to the inter∣teynementes and proffers of court, wherwith DON CHAR∣LES saluted hym and his companye, he recited to hys newe brother in lawe in the hearinge of the rest, that as not longe since, he with his syster came to his lodginge with request to communicate with him in secrete, so for his parte, hee is nowe there afore hym to reueale suche thinges as he hadd determined since his departure, & that in the publike audi∣ence & witnes of that companie whiche he hadd assembled of purpose, and to whom with al the worlde, he intended to im∣parte his rare honestie and vertue, with suche reuenge as himselfe mente to take vppon theim as seamed to honoure him with the offer of any pleasure, or surmounte him in the gifte of thank efull dealyng: whiche wordes seamed to ende as the whole companye was set in order with erspectacion to sée theffecte of this misterie, and beinge all in scilence he torned his face with an oraciō to the multitude in these tear¦mes. Me thinkes I sée you all in a wonderfull amaze with seuerall ymaginacion of my entente, in procuringe this as∣semblie Salymbyn to his frendes so, the mari∣age of Ange∣liqua. at so inconueniente an hower and in suche a place, where none of you all (my kinsmen and frends) nor my selfe hetherunto haue euer sett foote to enter without desier to endomage or do some notable harme to the reste of theym that remaine of the MONTANYN LYNE, whiche astonishe∣ment I shall also suspende in you, till the ende of this shorte preamble, which, I haue preferred for the better vnderstā∣dinge of the parte I meane to playe. And if you will consider with regarde of indifferent iudgement, and waighe in equal ballance, the thinge whiche is called good in the hartes of suche as differrynge from the brutall sorte do followe the

MEADES who albeit were norished and broughte vppe a∣mongeste the heardmenne of their parentes, yet gaue they place to no contrey in magnanymytie of mynde. And who hath exceded or bene equall in generosytie or noble corage of harte to ROMVLVS the firste founder of the prowde Romulus brought vp a∣monge shep∣herdes. cytie of Rome? yet was hée assisted with no better educa∣cion or trayninge vppe thenne in caues and cabynettes of shepherdes, and suche as inhabyte the playne and deserte fieldes for the garde of their cattell: all whyche I haue pre¦ferred vnto you (my Lords & Ladyes) as a special prepratiue to the peculiar praise and commendacion of the vndowted noblenes of mynde of SIGNEVR CHARLES MONTA∣NYN and his syster, who wythoute preiudice or wronge to anye, maye well be tearmed the peragon for bewtie and mirroer of honeste and chaste behauioure, aboue all the La∣dies annd gentlewomen in oure common wealthe, whose house as you knowe hathe bene so oppressed wythe conty∣nual persecucion, that onely they two are the laste remeyn∣doures of their whole race, standinge also not longe since at the pointe of extreme ruyne and vtter subuersion for euer, yet the ympocision of suche straunge miseryes, colde neyther moue any dymunicion of corage, nor staye of de∣syer to expose an effecte of that vertue and bowntie whyche nature hathe appointed to occupie the hartes of theym that bée true noble: wherein as I sée some iustice to exclaime againste the crueltie of our auncestors, for that the only res∣pecte of a smal broyle happeninge by chaunce, hathe moued them to thonder a most mortal vengance of this so auncient and vertuous a stocke: So for my part, being pryuie to mine Of vnlavvfull vvinning of the father cō¦mes iust losse to the sonne own conscience, with remembrance of the wise admonicion of the graue philosopher saying, that as of vnlawfull win∣ninge of the father comes iuste losse to the sonne: soo hee that makes himselfe a tyrante by force, becomes oftentimes a slaue by Iustice, I thinke it necessarye not onelye to
blowe the laste retraite of all grudge betwene vs, but also worke the effecte and confirmation of a future amytie for euer hereafter, And if the view of thauncient quarrels and mutunies of former time do staye your consente to present compassion of their case, yet let not the honest trade of lyfe, ciuill behauiour, and modest disposition of this brother and syster, depart without the due mede and hyer of their vertue neyther let vs suffer their place in the senate to bee emptie or voyde of supplie, that earste hathe bene furnished with the presence of the moste noble and wise men of our cytie, to thende that our example may serue as a precedent to the future tyme, in that thonlye respecte of vertue, and not ry∣ches makes vs restore the dekayed stockes of our common wealthe, wherein also we shall iustelye deserue the title of our highe discente from the puissant and mightie emprours of Rome, who gaue euer more honour to the vertuous po∣uertie, then regarde or commendacion to the richeman con¦uerted The romains respected more the ver∣tuous pouer∣tie, then allo∣vved the rich man conuer∣ted into vice. into vice or abhominable indeuours. But nowe be∣cause I sée you alredie sorowearyed with the lengthe of a lingrynge suspence desyerynge to knowe the cause of thys greate commendaciou of the MONTANYNS, with request to abridge my tediouse discourse, if you will lende me yet a litle liberty to speake, with patience to heare the chiefe poyn¦tes of my protestation, the spedie ende of my tale shal restore present quiet and contentment to your trobled myndes. It is longe since I muste confesse (and yet thoffence is neyther mortal, nor falte so hainous but it may be forgiuen) that the beauty with other parts of perfection in the faire Angeliqua here presente, so rauished my sences and robbed me of my libertie at one instant, that thonly exercise whych occupyed my head daye and nighte for a longe tyme, was the sondrye deuises I ymagyned to discouer vnto her my martiredome, wherin I fedd the hongry humor of my affection, with such alarams and contraryetie of conceites, that hauinge by thys meane loste the necessary appetite of the stomake, and vsual desyer of sleepe, I felte suche a diminucion of nature and
lyuelye force thorowe all the partes in me, that I was presented at one tyme wyth the choice of two moste peril∣lous euils in the worlde, the one to dye afore my tyme by suffocacion of pynnynge dollour, or els to yelde to a depri∣uation of my sences and gyfte of vnderstandinge for euer: wherein I was also pursued wyth the readye assistaunce of perplexed dispaire, for that I saw no meane to make that seame easye wherein I iudged so greate an impossibi∣litye, chieflye by the grounded quarels of oure ij. houses, whereby albeit the warre seames ended, and the grudge halfe appaised betwene vs, yet was I of opinyon, that there remeined an equall desyer in the hartes of vs both, neyther to wishe well the one to the other and muche lesse to absteine from further slaughter, when so euer a newe oc∣casion shoulde eftesones fall oute, neyther coulde theis mor∣tall impedimentes argue sufficient raison to diminish min affection, but sturred vp rather a treble increase of desyer, accordynge to the passioned minde enchaunted with loue, who makes suche as he possesseth more apte to desyre, then Loue make vs more apte to desier, then hable to at∣taine. hable to attayne to the effect of that whiche they wishe, pre∣ferrynge alwayes a simple likelihode in that wherin appe∣reth an absolute impossibilitye, to thende to afflicte theyr miserable lyues wyth continuall annoye: but as theis ex∣tremeties had filled my head full of dispaire and committed me to a continuall carefulnes of minde, because I coulde neither staye the course of my affection, nor encounter the obiect of my desyer, beholde fortune entred into compassi∣on of my state, assistynge me wyth so readye a medecine for my greate disease, that when I was voyde of all expectation or hope of recouerye, I was presented with a franke offer of my desyered praye, for as it is not vnknowen to you all that sence the departure of viij. or ten dayes, the Lord MON∣TANYN here present, beinge accused afore the SENATE vp∣pon certeine peinall statutes, deuised by our cruell state for the rappeale of banished men, was awarded by iudiciall sen∣tence to paye the forfaiture, whiche because he coulde ont
nottender within the tyme, his greadie enemies forced ye law to a more rigour then was necessarie, in suche sort as thexe∣cutioner was readie to extende vpon his bodie for want of a supplye of a thosande florents, to choake the couetous hu∣mour of the magistrates. Euen so the view of his extremi∣tie sturred vp such a remorce in my mynde that me thought I was sommoned by dutie to preuent the destruction of him, who was brother and thonly comfort of her whom I had al∣redye proclaimed the soueraigne Ladye and mystres of my hart, in whiche good vaine of deuocion I payd the money and procured his delyuerye, who (for his parte) deuinynge I can not tell vpon what occasion, that the beautie of his sister did worke theffect of suche a vertue in me, hath not onely been thankefull for the benefit, but also ouercome me in honeste liberalitie and true noblenes of mynde, presen∣ting me in the beginnynge of this eueninge at myne owne howse with a prodigal offer not onely of hymself and al yt he hath, but also of his syster whom he lefte with me to vse and dispose at my pleasure: wherein for ende I appeale to you all with one requeste that in waighinge rightly the gyfte of the one and offer of the other, you will consider of them both, and assiste me immediatly wyth your aduise in what sorte I maye yelde a due meede to suche ij. precious merites, the one a most familiar patterne and precedent of true nobili∣tie, and the other a present of suche price and value, that the greatest prince in ITALY coulde do no wronge to his greatnes in yeldynge honor and homage to so rare a thing: wherupon he stayed his further discourse, gyuinge place to thassistantes for consultacion of the case, whiche albeit they knewe imported deliberat aduise afore the resolution of iud∣gement, yet were they in amaze what sentence to gyue, be∣cause they were neither priuie nor partakers of the deter∣minacion of hym who had sommoned their apparance there, rather to witnes the fact then deuide the case, or impeshe his resolute intent by a contrarye councell. The Ladies his kynswomen were so moued to admiracion wyth the
maiestie and other argumentes of vertue in the faire AN∣GELIQVA that they had passed iudgement on her syde yf they had not feared to be refused of hym, who wished their voice that waye, and who onely beinge touched aboue the the rest most neare the quicke, dismissed their astonishment in reueilyng his owne determination in this sorte. Seinge you take so greate a tyme to discusse so small a matter with no lesse doubte to publishe sentence of that whiche is alredye determined let me abridge all arguments of further delaye in decipheryng in playne wordes the thynge whiche hetherunto I haue communicated but by circunstance, ou shall vnderstande sayth he (in takinge ANGELIQVA by the hande, that hauynge the regarde of honor afore myne eyes, with desyer to recompense at full the honestye and vertue of the brother. I am resolued to take the syster to my deare and lawfull wyfe, preferrynge by that meanes a perfect vnitye of that whiche longe tyme hath lyued in separacion, and make of twoo bodyes earste and longe disioyned, an equall wyll and entyer mynde, desyerynge all your consentes in the consommation of this alliance, whiche seameth rather the worke of God, then an effect of the councell or diligence of man: for the lawe of mariage Mariage the first thing vvherin christ glorified him∣self by mira∣cle. beynge an institution of the highest, and the thinge wherin Christ first glorified himself by miracle vpon earth is recor∣ded in thinfallible booke of his foreknowledge, to thende no∣thynge chaunce whiche is not permitted and forseene by the prouidence of the God of marueils, who sewerlye layed his hande vpon the (brother MONTANYN) in touching the with distresse and perill of lyfe to thende that my ANGELIQVA, being the onely meane of thy delyuerye might also laye an immouable fondacion of a mutuall vnitie betwene our two houses, which I hope shall furuiue the length of tyme and not ende but wyth the laste remeinder of eyther of our po∣sterityes. This conclusion thus hearde of the parentes, and kynsfolkes of SALYMBYNO, and canuaised alitle in their seuerall opinions, seamed at laste of suche reason
and indifferencie to them all, that they conuerted their con∣ceites whiche kepte them occupyed for a tyme into a present disposition of wonderfull ioye and gladnes feelynge in theyr intrals and inwarde partes (I can not tell by what secret instinct of minde) an approche of indissoluble tranquillitie on all partes, by the only coniunction of this newe allyance. And albeit there was no equalitye of porciō, & that ye dowere of ANGELIQVA stoode aloff from the reuenues of her newe consort, yet the vertue and giftes of grace appearyng in her, made her seame hable to counteruaile hym in any respect, & his frendes with one voice gaue generall commendacion to the goodnes of his fortune for plātyng his affection in so ver∣tuous a soyle, wherein sewerly they had good reason, for ma∣riage being a law and holye Sacrament giuen vs from God as thonly knott of mutuall tranquillitie betwene man and In the choice of our vvife vvee ought to respect the vertue and gyftes of the mind and not the riches or exterior be∣autye. woman oughte to be embrased for the vertue and sinceritie of the thynge and not abused with a regarde of richesse or o∣ther fylthye promocious of the worlde. And he that in the choice of his wyfe respectes chieflye her beautie and great∣nes of porcion, (besides a thousand pettie mutynies that fall out in housekeping,) escapeth seldom without a sprit of grudge or cyuill discension, disturbynge hys quiet wyth a continuall humour of frettynge disposition féedynge hys mynde, for the glasse of beautie retireth and gyueth place to age, whiche also mortifyeth the delite or desyer of further pleasure, and on thother syde the woman knowynge her discent more noble, and porcion to excede the welthe of her husbande forgetteth not to take hart at grasse, and dec∣kynge her garlande wyth all sortes of flowers of pryde and disdayne, séekes to gouerne and gett the vpper hande of hym, who as he is appointed her heade by the woordes of the scripture and institution of nature: So he oughte to kepe a straite hande of the same bridle and Raine of autho∣ritie, vsinge it as a chek to restraine the desyer of libertie in her, that studieth to haue hym in subiection, wherein
I wishe all bachilors and younge men vnmaried to be ar∣med againste so greate a mischiefe with the experience of suche theyr frendes as they see touched with the like griefe. And for my part I lament the disquiet of them, as woulde and can not, or rather dare not attempte a simple reforma∣cion in them who are borne to beare the yoke of awe and commandement of their husbandes, retournynge there∣wyth to the sequeile of SALYMBYNO, who workynge the laste effect and consommation of his curtesye, gaue the one halfe of his goodes of all sortes in fauour of the ma∣riage, adopting at thinstant the MONTANYN as his brother in lawe and assured frende, with generall substitution to all his goodes, if he chaunced to dye without heire of his bo∣dye, and hauyng children he conueighed vnto hym by suche assuraunce in reuercion as the lawe coulde deuise, that moy∣tie, whiche he gaue in dowerye to his faire ANGELIQVA, whome the Sonday folowynge he maried with pompe due to both their estates, to the vniuersall contentement of his frendes, and speciall quiet of the Citye, who had endured longe affliction by the mortalitie and ciuill warre of theis ij. houses: Suche be the varieties happenyng in the successe of our wordly affaires, wherein who wil denye but that aduer∣sitie somtime is necessarie for men, seinge she doth not only force a wonderfull remorce and reformacion of lyfe, but Aduersitie is necessary for that it makes vs parfect. also workes often tymes an effect of that wherin appeared an absolute impossibilitie of conquest by any other meane. And truly the vertue of this example discredites vtterly the commendacion of the auncient ROMAINES, amongeste whome as there chaunced diuerse tymes greate enimyties and grudge of mynde, so there folowed a spedie reconcile∣ment (albeit not by suche meanes as this franke attonement betwene the SALYMBYNS and MONTANYNS, but some were reclaymed by the offer of promocion, some solicited by the voice of the whole common welth and confirmed by the present gyfte of some notable office, and other with a regard
to peculyar proffit, not one of them all approchynge neare the magnanimitie in the worste of these three, whereof the one sommoned by a passion of loue scamed to excede nature in perfourmynge an exploit not hable anye waye els to be wrought to effect: And yet there be that cryenge out againste loue paintes hym in cullors of rage, follye and frenzye, but suche are rather abused wyth theyr owne conceites, then hable to consider ryghtelye the vertue of that impression: for loue in the noble harte is no other thing then the true subiecte of curtesye, the fountaine from whence distilleth the originall of all cyuill and good order, The vertues in loue in a noble minde. the onelye meane, that moues vs to moderacion when we are inclined to crueltie or reuenge, and the chiefest norsse and preseruer of peace amongest men, wherein yf some vile disposition happen to violat or peruert the lawes of so necessarie and auncient institution of nature, the ver∣tue and subiect it selfe yet oughte not bee touched wyth the cause of suche faulte nor deserue to be noted of any cor∣ruption, seinge suche derogation procedes by the abuse of hym that knoweth not the perfection of the thynge, which falles out also in experience in diuerse other accidentes, who beinge vertues of them selues, do loase theyr credit, by the malice of suche as abuse them vyllanouslye, wher∣vpon the good thynge is often condemned by the folly of suche as are ignoraunt in the perfection of the same, in the other appeares a rare disposition of a bountifull mind, so farre from the abhominable spot of ingratitude, that his lyfe was ready to bee offred for the satisfaction and dis∣charge of the curtesie if the other had required it, where∣in as you maye see greate effectes of true magnanymi∣tye, and wherein a noble mynde oughte not to bee ouer∣come with the vertue of honeste curtesye, so touchynge the price of the victorye, I meane whiche of the three is moste meritorious of commendacion, and deserueth to weare the garland, I referre the iudgement to thindiffe∣rencie
of suche as wythout passion or parcialitye doe vse to note the chaunces happenynge to men, you see a mor∣tall enemye sorowed for the miserie of his aduersarie, but solycited thereunto (you will saye) by the ineuitable force of loue, whiche also wroughte his delyuerye: the other mar∣ched wyth the glorye of a present so rare, that the greatest Monarcke of the worlde maye be astonyed with the remem∣braunce of his prodigall bountie. The wonderfull zeale and affection of the syster towardes her brother chalengeth no lesse praise then the reste, who albeyt she had séene a proof of the curtesye of her enemye, yet had she no assu∣rance of his modestie, notwythstandynge to discharge euerye waye her dutye towardes her brother she layde her virginitye vppon the blocke of vyolacion: the fyrste clay∣meth to bee victor, because his laste vertue in the ma∣riage excedes his former curtesie, but he hath ouerthrowen his enemie and not won the feelde, so that he is not to en∣ioye the prayse or price of the victorye. The absolute reso∣lution of the younge Ladye to kyll herselfe, if she were forced to dishonnour againste her wyll, takes awaye all glorie and commendacion from her, yf the care to kepe ho∣nour and virginitye, dyd not preuaile aboue the preserua∣tion of lyfe: the brother and thirde of this Crew, albeyt this prodigal offer proceded by compulcion of the for∣mer bountye of hys frende, yet the noblenes of hys mynde was equall to the reste, and hys vertue nothynge inferiour to eyther of the other twoo. And yet yf it were not the singuler respecte he had to retourne hys be∣nefytt wyth double interest, wyth care to bee more then sufficientlye thankefull to his patrone, I coulde dymi∣nishe hys glorye, wherein because the lamentable tra∣gedye of twoo poore louers sōmones me to discouer theyr misaduenture, wyth no lesse reason to furnishe the stage with a declaracion of theyr loyaltye, then your Ladyship hath alredye harde the whole discourse of the rare vertues
in SYENNA, I leaue suche Gentlemen and skilful Dames (who take paine to skan this historye) to argue the cause at large, and resolue iudgement at leasure, not doubtynge of your integritye in yeldynge the true tytle of tryumphe and glo∣rie to some one of the three, whome you ac∣compte moste worthie to bee crowned with the Lawrel of victorye. FINIS.
The argument. THere is nothinge how good and profy∣table so euer it appeare, whereon at∣tendethe not a discommodytie to hym that deales in it wythout discrecion, to∣gether with a perentorye displeasure in receiuing it contrarye to the consent of good gouernemēt wherin I may be assisted with sufficient confirmation in a daylye experi∣ence of the ordynarye meates, brothes, and other confec∣cions tollerated by phizicke for the sustentacion of man, whiche albeit bee good of theim selues, yet being swallo∣wed in glottonous sort, they do not only procure a surfeyt with vnsauery indisgestion, but also conuerting our aun∣ciente healthe and force of nature into humors of deby∣lytie destillinge thorowe all the partes of the bodye, do corrupte the blodde which of it selfe afore was pure and without infection: Euen suche is the disposition of loue, whose effectes, directed by reason (whiche oughte to guide euerie accion and doing of man) be not suche enemies in deede to the quiet of our lyfe, as necessary meanes to re∣forme the rudenes of our owne nature, accordinge to the authorytie of the poet affirminge that by loue the rude∣man is reduced to a cyuilitie, the foole learneth wisedom, the cowarde becomes valiaunte, and the couetouse nigard Sondry ver∣tues in loue. settes his purse wyde open to hys frende: neyther is there any kinde of curtesye wherwith hee that is in loue doth not participat: but who makes an experience of the contrarye, I meane without aduise or iudgemente will throwe himselfe hedlonge into the golphe of a folishe and ronning phantasye, escapes hardly without the rewarde
whiche that frantike passion yeldeth ordenarely to suche as are vnhappelye partakers of suche infection, neyther is there any thinge more furthereth the ruyne and dekaie of man then suffriuge the eyes of our vnderstandinge to be seeled with suche ymitate to ymate that as a glott of our gredy desyers, whiche nature hathe enioyned to all estates to honour and embrace as a speciall vertue. And trulye me thinkes that, that folishe and infortunat crewe mighte reserue therrours and destructions of others as speciall pattornes and preceptes to restraine the humor of their owne madnes, by the whiche (or they be aware) they are ledd to the brinke of mortall destruction: albeit thindiscretion of that miserable sorte seames nothinge vnlike in comparaison to those that hauinge longe vsed the trade of thefte and robberye, and seinge their compa∣nions passe by the sentence of a corde, lacke grace not∣withstandinge to disclaime the wickednes wherin they haue bene nozeled so many yeares, neyther is their plage (or rather iuste punishmente) any thinge inferior, for they makinge a chiefe glorye of that whiche is moste imper∣fecte in loue, are eyther so subiecte to dispaire, or beastely assotted withe the greedye encownter of the pleasure they fynde, that procuring by theyr owne folly and want of order the processe of their fatall sommaunce in the en∣trey to their felycitye, are forced to resigne at one instante their lyfe and loathinge contentmente of lesse contynu∣ance then the paines in loue seame greuous to the mynde that hath ye gift to passe theim ouer by reason. And like as a vehement and inwarde greffe of the mynd (proceding by the malice of a synister fortune,) is of such force, to close the poares and couduictes of the vitall partes of man, that cancellinge the commission of lyfe, the soule departes lea∣uinge
the body without sence, like power I saye hath the vehemencie of semblable gladnes, which occupienge all the partes with a generall ioye (excedinge the strength of nature) makes the mynde insufficent of force to with∣stande so greate a passion, whereby strykinge the saile of lyfe, the bodye is seene to vanishe as the candle lackinge waxe or weake or other matter assistinge the flame which giueth light to the beholders, wherof we haue diuerse au∣thoryties in the histories of antiquitye, as one of the dough¦ters in law to the high priest Helye who hearinge of the death of her husbande & the takinge of the arke of the lord ended her lyfe with the dollorous reapport: the lyke hap∣peninge vnto her father in law for the ouerthrowe of the children of Israell by the infydelles and vncircumcised: in like sorte we haue confirmacion in diuerse prophane dis∣courses of such as haue yelded the ghoste in a traunce of vnreasonable ioye and lawghiuge, as Dyagore Rhodiotto, & the philosopher Chilon, who vpon the newes that their children had won the prise at the plaies at Olympus em∣brased their happye fortune with such exceding gladnes, that vpon the place and present they yelded againe their tearme of borowed yeres, also a folyshe Romaine woman hearing of the death of her son in a battaile fought against thennemy, disgested it with great constancy, but seing his safe retorne from the field contrary to her expectacion and former newes she was so assailed with superfluity of glad∣nes that in place to congratulate his deliuery from the pe∣rill of war she dyed in embrasing hym as of a passion of dis∣measured contentmēt, which argueth sufficiently the folly of them that in any degre bestowe eyther ioy or sorow so neare their harte, that besydes the destruction of the body they become thunnatural morderers of their owne soules
wherin wt what enamel so euer they seke to guild & colour such vices yet can they not be excused of an humour of mad¦nes proceding of a vaine braine exposing frutes according to ye spirit or guide ye possesseth them, neyther is ther any cō¦mendation at al due vnto such as thorow ympacience giue ende to their lyfe by dispaire, with what title or sorname of constancy the fond philosophers of olde time do baptyse those accions of meare fury & frenecy, wherof as the mise∣rable end of these. ii louers yeldes sufficient testymonie dieng both in one hower of diuerse accidēts the one of a dismeasured ioye the other of a passion of despe∣ratte sorowe, so because the discourse is of vn∣dowted troth I wishe it might moue cre∣dyt to the reador and councell to al men to eschew the like inconuens∣ence deryued of sembla∣ble occasion.
THE LONG AND LOY∣all Loue betwene Lyuyo and Camylla to∣gether with their lamentable death, the one dying of a passion of ioye the first night he em∣braced his mystres in bedde, the other passed also the same way as ouercome wyth present sorow for the deathe of him whom she loued no lesse then her selfe. ❧∴ AT such tyme as ALEXANDER the sixt surnamed BORGIA supplied the pa∣pistical seate at rome, dwelt in SYSEN¦NA a yong gentleman called LYVYO with his syster CORNELIA, neare vn¦to whome was the house of a knight bering ye name of RENALDO, hauing a son called CLAVVDIO with a daugh¦ter CAMYLLA, which two yong dame selles, by reason of neighborehead and contynuall norryture together duringe their infancye, reteyned a league of suche mutuall famylyaritie and conuersaciō, yt their socyetye with often entercourse together seamed no lesse then if nature had made theym the children of one father, wherein as R∣NALDO and his wife reioysed not a litle on the behalfe of their doughter, for that CORNELIA was accompted to ex∣cede the rest of yonge Ladies in honest behauiour and gyftes of vertue: So if it had not bene for a froward disposicion in CLAVVDIO, (who grudged without cause the companye of LYVYO) this conuersacion and haunt of the girles had sea∣med of easier continuance: Albeit as his presence gaue of∣ten ympedimente to their metinge, so his absence restored their enterviewe, in such sorte, as he was no soner departed to parforme his fathers affaires at Rome or els where, but
his syster forgat not to visit her deare CORNELIA, passinge theyr pettie follyes and recreacions of honest delyte most cō∣monly at the lodginge of LYVYO, for that there was neither awe of father nor other authoritie to controll their exercise, which for the most part was every after none to dresse fyne banquetes, striuing to excede one an other in curiositye and conning with a thousande other conceytes and merye cha of huswiferie, which seamed of no lesse pleasure to theim, then the pomppe of wanton delytes wherewith princes and other great Ladies are respected, serued & honored, and some time courted by a crew of veneryan & carpet knights with diuers ymportunyties and vnseamely requests of loue, who as he is Loe is an hu¦mor of infec∣on deriued of the cor∣rupte partes in our selues an humor of infection deriued of ye corrupt partes in our sel∣ues and yet cōmon to vs all by nature, so is he chiefly furthe∣red in therecution of his euil, by an vsuall frequentacion and hawnte of parties whereof maye bee noted a moste fa∣myliar experience in this LYVIO, who during the practis of the two girles, toke such viewe of the bewtie and behauiour of CAMLLA (seing her only go, and come to the chamber of his syster,) that he began to sipp of the Cuppe of affection no lesse then DIDO, kyssing CVPIDO vnder the figure & sem∣blance of the litle ASCANIVS son to the valiant ENEAS ney∣ther coulde he be so constant to repulse this first apprehensiō but (maugre his hart) he yelded to the somonce of his affection and at the first assalt surrendred the fortresse, to him that of∣fred the warr, who at the first entry made himselfe lord ouer Loue. the free partes of this prisoner, & rampired him selfe so stron∣ly within thinteriour of his mynd, that he was not onely in one instāte the gouernour of his thoughts, but also directing his whole doings by ye diall of his descretion, fedd hym onely wyth the vnsauerye Iewice of tormente and contynuall pas∣sion, in suche sorte as not knowinge whether hee shoulde encounter a retorne of reciprocall glee, hee seamed to loue vppon credytte takinge pleasure in interteynynge his vn∣certeyne thoughts and vaine delite of his flatteryng fancy, where in hee had hadde some reason if the conference of CA∣CAMILLA
had kindled the coles of this affection in his mind for that as I haue sayde frequentacion bredeth first the desy∣er, so wordes haue force to further theffecte of diuerse thyn∣ges VVords haue force to fur∣ther the ef∣fecte of anye thinge whiche otherwaies we colde neuer bringe to passe or if he had bene aunswered wyth a SYMPATHIA or equalitie of frendshipp by her on whose behalfe he comytted such fond ydolatrye, but what? when a man hath once set a broch the hu¦mor of his follie, he accomptes it a great symplicitie to desist afore he haue performed euery effecte and suggestion of the blynde guide that gouerneth his vnrulye wil, for this yonge Pigeon of the first plume, hatching in the secret of his mind that, whiche he durst not discouer, toke singler pleasure in the repetycion of the delite which he desiered, ymagining that CAMILLA had cropped of the same herbe whereof hee had swallowed, both the leafe and roote, and that shee was no lesse zelous, on his behalfe, then he ye slaue forced and enchan∣ted by the vertue of her glisteringe beawtie, wherein as de∣serte and solytarie soyles bee harbors moste conuenyente Desert soyles be harbors mete for soli∣tary persons for suche as be occupied wyth passion, so hee beganne by lytle and litle to disclayme all companye and places of assem¦blie, and accompted his greatest felycitie to discourse wyth his thoughtes in the open & barraine feldes, wher onely the ayre did witnes his dollor and the birdes partakers of hys hollowe sighes, wherin walkyng one day (amonge the rest) a long a Coppies or Groue of short wode norished by ye moi∣sture of two or thre pleasante chanelles, distilling from cer∣teyne Rockes builded by nature vpon the hight of the moun∣teynes, whych fauoured his dolful complainte with an EC∣CHO of semblable dule, he exposed an effect of his passion in these sorowfull termes what angrye dome of the godds or sinyster permission of the fates is this (sayth he) which depri∣uyng The cōplaint of Lyuyo. my harte of his auncyente lybertie hath made a trans∣port of my thoughtes vpon thymage of a beawtie that re∣semblethe the clearenes of the heauens, and eclipsethe, what soeuer is perfecte or fayre vppon earthe? frome whence procedes thys newe authorytye whyche com∣manndinge
the strongeste parte in me, seameth to force a desier to wishe that wherof myne eyes haue alreadie giuen iudgement touchinge the bewtye of thonely mistres of my thoughtes? what soddayne alteration is this to transforme my libertie into a seruile thraldome, and yet of more delite and contentement then if I were pronounced thonely soue∣raine and Lord of the whole patrymonie? Alas I thinke thac∣cidente excedynge the compasse or computacion of nature, ympartes his power & title with the celestial authorityes a∣boue, for myne eyes do daylye fede vpon the presence of CA∣MYLLA andene ountreth a contynuall viewe of her com∣panye, but the true effecte of that whiche is parfecte vnder the corporal vaile can not bee discerned but by figure & force of ymagynacion, the which rauishinge my sences hath made me the slaue of her, who liuynge without subiection or touch of passion, may peraduenture conuerte the SYMPTOMES of my present greefe into a conceyte of litle or no regarde, wyth adisdayne of thoffer of my affection. To what ende sholde I endeuor to gather the frute, when the leaues will graunte me no fauour, or who will bende his deuocion towarde the shryne, if the sainte close the gates of compassion agaynste him: in like sorte what pleasure haue I to embrase a shadowe when the bodye disdaineth my homage and offer of seruice: oneles there be a felycitie in the life of the CAMELEON, liuinge with the breath or ayre of the Skies, for in fearinge The Camele∣on is noris∣hed by the breath of the ayre. to discouer my grefe, I haue cause to dispaire of the remedie, and in fedinge onely vppon vaine and vncertaine ymagina∣cions, I am to expecte no other contentment but such as dis∣tilleth from the fountayne of such simple fauours, that now I find theim the happiest kinde of creatures to whom nature hath ymparted such rude shappe and grosse vnderstandynge, that they cannot in any sorte receaue thimpressions of loue, where we alas that are deryued of a more delicate molde and enioyned to a generositye of spirite aboue the reste are bar∣red the beuefyt of all felycitye in admittinge as a principall pleasure ye thing which tormentes vs more mortallie then if
we were persecuted with all thafflictions of the worlde. Herein appeares the folye and wante of discretion in man doatinge vpon the vanities and passions whiche of hym self hee plantes in hym selfe, without foreseinge howe vnhable hee is to restore his quiete after hee bee once attainted with the humour of suche corruption. But what? may any one man be assisted with speciall priuilege in that which na∣ture hath made common to vs all, I meane is it in the po∣wer of any to procure dispence from the daunger of loue, or staye the coles kindled in our intrailes to burst into blase or open flame? no no, for of a million that haue fallen into the snares and perils of affection, I haue not knowen anye one that hath disposed of hym selfe and thoughtes, other wayes then accordynge to the discretion of hym that sekes to mortifye our quiet and triumphe in the seruilitye of vs wretches, yet for my parte seinge there is no euill in em∣brasing things that be faire, for that (according to thoratour) the faire and good are so conioyned together that the one Cicero glorifyenge in the other are confirmed both with equal esti∣mation, why shoulde I not pursue the loue of my deare CAMILLA, whose exterior regardes argew a greater ver∣tue then to refuse the offer of my simple and honest seruice, supported with an intente of vnfayned loyaltie so longe as nature shall assiste me with one moment of tyme in this worlde. But alas what reason hath she to graunte to that whiche I dare not demaunde, or howe shoulde she satisfye my requeste, beinge altogether ignoraunte of my mea∣nynge, and seynge by conceylinge my desyer, my greefe is growen to an agrauacion of torment, why staye I to dis∣close the cause, to the ende I maye eyther receyue the soue∣raine CATAPLAME for my sore, or els the laste and fatall syroppe, whiche maye sende me to complaine mine euill in the other worlde: wherin as he made here his plat to com∣municate his loue with his mistres, so the veray presence of CAMILLA & feare to offende her, toke awaye theffect of that resolucion, conuerlinge his complot into a misterie of some
dreame or vision inuisible, whereby what with the increase of his passion and feare to bewraye thoccasion, his greefe grewe to a disease presentyng argumentes of debilitye and diminutiō of strength wt lose of aunciēt colour in his face so far furth, yt he seamed not the same LYVIO which earst was so welcome into all companies, no lesse for hys grace and perfection of nature, then his guifte of pleasante discourse, seinge that nowe in so shorte a tyme he is so transposed into the habite and disposition of a malencolike and solitarie har∣mit, that there appeared no lesse impossibilitie to haue hym assiste any assemblye accordynge to the commendable cu∣stome of nobilitie or youth of gentle discente, throwe all the franchises in ITALY, then to mortifye in one instante the furye of his solitary passion, in suche sort that the young Ladyes and gentlewomen companyons to his syster, began to deskande of his coye and religious trade of lyfe, some of theim (accusinge hym of folishe disdaine), noted a sorte of sauage and hagarde disposition, and some seinge as fare into his disease as the phizicion into his water, referred the cause of this soddaine chaunge to the mortall and ineuitable woundes of the cruell son of the faire CYPRIS, wherwith CORNELIA, troubled withoute measure that the alteraci∣on of her brother was the onely wonder of the multitude, greuyng no lesse for her parte, then the reste seamed ama∣zed, accoasted hym one mournyng in a close arbore or alleye of his gardin where he was recording his amarous cōceits, and disposed her selfe tunderstande the cause vnder these termes. I hope sayeth she my present cōmyng (excedyng my Cornelya to her brother. ordinary custome) will not moue you to conceytes of pre∣sumption against me, chiefly for that I desier to cōmunicate with you in that which your self ought to disclose to such as are deare vnto you, to thende that if the meane to restore you consiste in straungers, the remedie may folow with ex∣pedicion, but if a sleighte slaue may cure a slender sore & that your gréefe is of no other cōsequence then a passion of yma∣ginations, why do you not take vp the vaine that fedes the
humour of such fonde conceites, & of your selfe dismisse the darke cloudes of youre troubled fansie. For I assure you the shame whiche I haue on the behalfe of your doing is no∣thyng inferiour to the panges you féele, chiefly for that your solenme trade of life ringing in mine cares by a general rea¦porte of all men, makes me not only refuse diuerse assēblies whiche I ought to visite, but also loath the companie of my deare cōpanions, who forget not to reproche me with impu∣tacion of our change, protesting vnto you that if you cōfirme it with any lōger time I wyl also assiste your solitarie trade, and kepe my self so recluse, that in forbearing to visite my frends abroade, I wil also forbid thaccesss of any at home: for what delit do I fynde in any cōpanye when al degrees salute me with your desolate order of liuyng, and iudge you what pleasure I take that earst did glory wt the best, in ye behauior of my brother most welcome aboue all men to euery estate, & now to heare you loaden with titles & surnames of proude, disdainful, ful of faies with a thousand other imposicions of like reproch. Wherfore for end if ther remaine in you any care of your owne estimation, or respect to cōtent me, I be∣sech you eftesones sticke not with me in so small a sute as ye discouerie of the cause and circumstaunce of your annoye, assuring you for my part by the vertue of our parents deces∣sed that my life shal refuse no peril to remoue your distres, & that with no lesse good will, then I desier with my harte a spedie cōuersion of your malencolike countenance into re∣gardes of auncient ioye, imparting by that meanes an vni∣uersal gladnes to al your frēds who are driuen to participat with you in sorow til they sée a restauracion of your former quiet, wherwith LYVIO takyng thaduauntage of thaffected zeale of his syster, who gaue him assuraunce of her promisse in that whiche he durste not demaunde, knewe not at the firste what replye to preferre, but that it was not against nature for a man to flitt from happye lyfe to heauye state, The ansvver of Cornelyo to his sister. neyther oughte it (sayth he) to seame a wonder to the peo∣ple, when we expose alteracion of complexion, for suche
are equall to angels or semblable to the brutall sorte with out sence, that are priuiledged from passion, or can kepe so temperate a meane in receyuyng and disgestyng thaccidents of this worlde, which accordynge thoccurrance and euene∣m entes of tymes, do expose argumentes of mirthe or sorow Ho bearethe his misery beste that hi∣deth it most. in the faces of them whome they possesse, and albeit I con∣fesse vnto you, that as he beares his miserie beste that hides it moste, so suche are worthye to haue the name of perfecte men, who enconteringe their disaster with a constante magnanimitye of minde, do dissimule their greefe afore the worlde, to thende they only may giue remedye to that which is common to none but theym selues, wherin for my parte I coulde neuer enioye a participation of suche perfection, neyther is thoccasion of my extremitie so easely couered but the drouping regardes in my face are readie to make decla∣ration of my torment, besides I haue no greate cause of shame of mine euill, consideringe the same importes an en∣terprise of noble consequence, albeit I make some conscience to discouer the principall cause. But considering the round∣nes of your offer, and howe boldly one of vs maye participat wyth an other I am contente to imparte with you the cir∣cumstance of my passion, wherin as you haue charged me with chaunge and alteracion of countenance, debilitie and diminucion of the strongest partes in me, with a sauage and hagarde order of lyuynge as you haue tearmed it, so in vnderstandynge the cause, I hope you wylexcuse me of effectes of other folly then suche as nature hath enioyned in generaltie to all men, and to cut of your suspence and absolue your troubled mynde of all doubte, you shall vn∣derstande that the force of loue (depriuinge myne aun∣ciently berty) hath also transposed my former quiet & solace of mynde, into these mournynge and pynynge regardes whiche you note in me, neyther can I be restored to the state which you wishe without the assuraunce of that which I de∣sire, whiche is the good wyll of her to whome loue hath be
gyuen so large power ouer me. And as euery medecine is measured by the greatnes of the disease, and the lyght hurte is easelye healed without tryinge the exquisite skill of the Phisicion, so my gréefe beinge grounded vpon great conse∣quence, doth not onely assaile me withall sortes of passions and panges of sorowe, but also denyeth to brooke the opera∣cion of other remedie but suche as is distilled from the earbe that first infected me, it is not the offer of smal harmes, that makes me so hurtefull to my self and hateful to my frendes, nor the subiect of tryflynge annoye that sturres vp theis sighes and solytarie disposition in me, it is alas for beautye her felfe that I suffer, eye the veray patterne and goddesse of all perfection, hath made me so forgetfull of my selfe that I seame a straunger to my deare frendes, neyther haue I o∣ther power of my selfe, then suche as is imparted vnto me by her whose picture I cary so lyuely in my minde: CORNE∣LIA altogether ignorant in the force of affection, and by rea∣son of the gréenes of her yeres voyed of experience in tour∣nynge ouer the volumes of loue, coulde not but smyle for the firste at thei argon or discourse of her brother, albeit no∣tinge his perpleritie, she let fall also certaine teares on the behalfe of his desolate state, and seynge hym wholly conuer∣ted into contemplation of a vision, iudged it an effecte of pi∣tye to gyue ayde to his distresse, whereupon she desired eftsones in mery sorte to knowe the goddesse of his de o∣cions, to the ende (sayth she) that I may yelde her honor for youre sake, and seinge you dare not presente her your re∣queste, I maye enter into the office of an intercessour, and praye for your delyuerye, neyther nede you doubte to dis∣close her to me, nor dispayre of my dilygence and readye indeuour to do you good, onles you be so farr spente wyth Ialous passion that you feare, I wyll rausshe her from you, or preuente the desier of your pleasure in beinge in loue with her my self, you abuse ye loyaltye of my meaning, and I doe wronge to exacte so farre vpon rour secret ima∣gination: I am cōtente sayth he you I est candtake pleasure
in the eusll whiche I suffer, so that you will performe the effecte of your promisse, whiche you maye the rather ac∣complishe by the credit you haue with her who is the onely cause of my tormente, whereof after she had giuen hym a seconde assuraunce by othe and protestation of faythe, he tolde her (not withoute a freshe supplie of sorowe) that it was CAMILLA to whom his libertie was captile, and in the ballance of whose compassion wayghed indifferent∣ly, the lycence of longer life, or sentence diffinitiue of pre∣sente death, desierynge her for ende to make her priuie to the paine he indured, and with all to procure spedie modera∣cion of his gréefe, or els to awarde the writte of fatall so∣monce to hym that is not hable to féede the vaine of lyfe without the foode of her speciall fauour: The gyrle delityng still in the amarous discourse of her brother, willed hym to take harte at grasse and makynge exchaunge of his solyta∣rle order to a wake out of his dreame of dompes and reuoke his disposition of auncient cherefulnes, leaste his mistres loathing his thyn and wearishe lookes be affraide to graunt loue to a Stoane or suffer her selfe to be embrased by one, in who me is neither present delite nor likelihod of fu∣ture pleasur. Ah sister saith hee how your libertie of tounge argueth your small experience in cases of loue, whose de∣lites consiste in teares, sighes, and dolorous complaintes, wherein as suche as be moste constante of all, make decla∣ration also of effecte of suche loyaltie in takinge plea∣sure to recorde their sorowe, with tunes of lamentable note, so in exposinge the contrarie, we discouer at vnwares the slender affection we beare to the thynge we desier, and for my parte I fele no lesse pleasure by ymagination, when I see with the eyes of my mynde the beautie and other perfections of my deare CAMILLA, then you whiche neuer tasted of the apprehension of this frée constrainte whiche the destenie of loue hath appointed to attend vpon me: I am glad saith she to be warned in this sorte to eschewe the lyke
euill in my selfe, and sorie to note the experience of so great an inconuenience in you, but seing you are so sewerly ram∣pired in your folye, that thoffer of persuasion is hatefull vnto you, I am contente you féede vpon suche ease as you finde, and take pleasure in the simple contemplacion of the ymage of your Saint, for, for my parte, I had rather haue an hower of reste, disposinge my selfe to slepe assone as my head & the pillow be met, then lye with mine armes of crosse regardynge the course of the starres, and builde castelles in the ayre, or be troubled in dremyng of the dissolution of the worlde, and then to baptise suche impediments and ene∣mies of reste by the name of the pleasures of loyall louers, with addition that it is a peculiar glorie gyuen them frō a∣boue by the inuisible goddesse, it is a pore repaste God knoweth for an emptie stomake to féede only of wishes, and satisfye his thurste with drinkinge of an emptie cuppe, or restore heate to the benommed partes by a cold chymney, or satisfye the desieringe minde with simple contemplacions, wherewith, she retired with intent to trye the nexte daye, whether CAMYLLA had any vaine that stretched to satisfye the desier of her brother, whome she lefte with more argu∣ment or consolation then afore, by reason of the hope he rea∣posed in her diligence. Here was a double offence in LIVIO both to force his syster to an enterprise indecent for her ho∣nor and age, and also to prefer her to be the DARIOLETTA of his loue, opening (as it were) the way of voluptuous plea∣sure to al youth yt which is to much enclined that way by the corruptiō of our own nature, without that we nede thassi∣stāce of art to supplie our defaultes in so vnhonest an ercer∣cise, albeit our blindnes is so great in things of such foly, that (in respectinge only ye present) we neuer feare ye fal of future incōuenience, til being serued with ye writ of present penāce It is necessa∣ry to knowe the imperse∣ctious of the worlde. we fynde to lytle leasure to repente so greate offences, and albeit (accordyng to Aristotle) it is necessarie to be priuie to thimperfeuions in the world and to knowe som tyme wher∣in we offerde, yet giues he this councell with al that, we
conuerte the experience of suche synister encounters, to a peculiar defense of our selues againste thassaultes of sem∣blable accidentes, and not to vse it as an authoritie or priui∣ledge to iustifie our wickednes or consume oure tyme in the ymitation of euill, wherein as the good men are defended by their vertue, so let the worser sorte be ware by so manye millions of examples as our vnhappie age at this present is hable to furnishe in the like affaires. And so to our historie, the morow after this discourse betwen the dolorous LYVIO and his syster, it chaunced that the doughter of RENALDO came all alone to see her companyon CORNELIA, who al∣beit was sufficiently mindefull of her promisse, yet was she furthered with a fit occasion by CAMYLLA, for that after certaine litle deuises betwene them she asked the cause of the sodaine chaunge and alteracion in her brother, & why he was no more séene to assiste the honeste assemblies in masque or other sorte, to whome CORNELIA aunswered, that as she was of equall desyer to knowe thoccasion of his solitarie ab∣sence, so greuynge aboue the reste with his pyning estate, I haue asked (saith she) the cause of his gréefe: which with the circunstance and effecte of all his annoye procedes from you (my deare frend and companyon,) as one in whome is noris∣hed the care and trauaile of mynde of my sorowfull brother. Howe is it possible saith the simple CAMILLA that I should worke hym any wo, seinge hitherunto I haue bene no lesse careful of his wel doing, then curious of mine owne health, neither haue I saide or don the thing (I am sewer) wherein was any pointe of euil meanynge towardes hym, onlesse he make construction of my simple and honeste zeale, lyke as also I would be sorie to be the author of his miscontentemēt any waye: the present passion of my brother saith CORNE∣LIA is deriued of a contrarie cause, for the to much delite and pleasure he hathe taken in seinge you, hathe broughte hym to the brinke of this bane, and yet as they wryte of the SCORPION hee hopeth to drawe the remedye frome her that hath geuen him the wounde. Yf you make not a more
plaine exposition of youre darke texte, sayeth CAMILLA I shall hardlye reade the misterye of your readle, for as yet I vnderstande nothinge but highe duche: eye marye sayeth thother and therein consisteth the chiefeste cause of my greefe, for if the peculyar affliction of my brother were comon also to you, or that you enioyed but a simple perticipa¦cion of his annoye, you shoulde not onlye vnderstande that which I am driuen to vnfolde, but be as readie to geue the re∣medie, as hee hathe reason in the meane while to suffer the grefe, or I ashamed to be the messenger. Do away this phi∣losophie my dearefrende (saythe CAMILLA and cutte of at laste my doubtfull suspence touchinge your meanynge, for if thuttermoste of that whiche is in me maye stande hym in steade, I will eyther performe the full of your demaunde, or at least yelde you such reason to the contrarye, that you shal∣be voyde of iust cause to complaine of myne aunswere. Here CORNELIA tolde her that thorigynall of her brothers e∣uill proceded of a wonderfull vehemencye of loue he bare to her, with addicion that if she yelded hym not the hyer of his zeale wyth a counterchaunge of affection, she shoulde see in shorte tyme the ende of his lyfe no lesse desperatelye, then in secrete sorowe hee consumeth the beste of his age in the loy∣all seruitude he hath alreadie vowed on her behalfe, and for my parte sayeth shee (not without some teares) as the vio∣lence of his passion (only knowen vnto me) hathe forced me to stande here thunseamely solycitor of his cause, so if it be a vertue to expose compassion vppon thafflicted, lette the res∣pecte of my dystresse sturre vppe an increase of pitie in you to ayde the desolation of my carefull brother: beholde (my CAMILLA) the circumstance of my presente extremitie, and ymagyn that wyth the losse of my brother dekaieth the onely proppe and pillor of my lyfe, and yet (simple girle that I am boide of experience in such affayres lo here I am constrayned to builde requestes no lesse inconuenient to my estate, then vnseamelye for my yeares, albeit for my purgacion to war∣desyou,
I hope the lawe of nature and loue of the syster to wardes her brother will excuse this diligence and indeuor which I vse to preserue the life of him whom I holde no lesse deare then the tendrest part of myne eye, wherwith CAMIL∣LA not without argumentes of some litle femynine anger staide her further discourse with this aunswere: who wolde haue thought sayeth she that a gentlewoman of your qualy∣tie and callinge wolde haue exceded the lymittes of her esty∣macion so farr, as for the respecte of the folishe appetit of a yonge man to discharge the parte of a shameles messenger in a case no lesse vnworthie for your honour, then contrarye to me to whom thimbassage is dressed? arte thou so credulus in the constancie of men (myne own CORNELIA) that thou wilte repose good earnest in that wherin they take pleasure to dissemble? or arte thou of opynion that as often as the io∣lytie of fraile youthe do prefarre sighes, and traunces with other dollorous regardes painted by dissymuled pollicie in the forefront of their faces, that it is true loue that pos∣sesseth  the true messen∣gers of the dollor of the harte. theym, or honeste desier that moueth their dule? no∣thinge lesse, for albeit teares for the moste parte are the true messengers of the dollour of the harte, and ought chief∣lye to moue compassion, yet in cases of loue they bee but suborned signes and declaracions of wanton desier, and for that cause oughte not to receiue other meede, thenne their meanynge dothe meritte, seynge wythall that the desie∣rous mynte groundes his pretence moste commonlye vp∣pon the thynge whyche vertue canne not brooke, and rea∣son denieth to graunte. And admitt it bee a follie peculy∣ar to many, and a passion ymparted to all men by nature to follow, thinstinct of loue, what grudge of conscience I praie you is it to a maide to suffer her vaine louer to pyne vppon creaditte, soo that shee stande so surelye vppon the garde of her chastetie, that shee be not seduced wyth his flatterynge charmes? it is not in our power to lette theym to loue: on∣lye we oughte to be carefull of our honour, and shon thin∣fection leaste we become vnhappye afore the tyme, besydes
howe greatlye shoulde wee abuse oure dutie and obedi∣ence towardes oure parentes in passinge a graunte of oure good will wythoute their consente, whyche onely oughte to directe vs in any sorte whatsoeuer. No, no, lett theym al¦mente and measure their mournynge at what intereste they thinke good, the same shall not staie the course of my sleepe, neither shal their teares eclips ye least momēt of my pleasure & contentmente, for when all is sayde, wee ought to conster the meaninge of these fayned sorowes to none other ende, but as priuie baites to intangle the simple and delicate you∣the of vs women, for when we ymparte compassion to their doleful alarams, and makes theym the maysters of their de∣siers, God knoweth the reward we finde, and how sone they laughe at oure fragilitie, and takinge pleasure to see vs in passion, do leaue vs pore wretches to the hyer of oure follie, So if LYVIO haue yinagyned a bargaine of loue, lett hym make muche of his owne conceite, and embrace the shadowe of his fansie, for, for my parte it shal suffice me to be armed with resistaunce and that I am voide of desier to encownter him or any other in that sort, wherwith contenting my selfe with the honest amytie betwene you & me (my deare CORN∣ELIA) I coniure you by ye vertue of the same, to giue ouer ye pursute of this quest, seinge that (besides the losse of tyme and slender proffit you are like to reape of your trauaile) you shal also lose a companion of me with small commendation to youre selfe, in courtinge the gestes that hawnte youre howse with requestes of suche vnseamelye effecte: whyche laste resolution stucke greatly on the stomake of CORNE∣LIA, for that the disdainefull repulse of her companion ar¦gued a dispaire hereafter to ease the distresses of her brother but chieflie she greued in that CAMYLLA seamed to enter into synister conceites against her, whiche, with an honest shame of that whiche was alreadie passed her mouthe and feare any more to offende that waye, together with her ig¦norance in the ordynarie replies of suche as haue taken de
grees in the skoole of loue, made her prefarre her excuse in simple sorte with promise hereafter to disclayme thenter∣prise, and blamynge whollie thymportunytie of her brother desiered notwithstandinge her CAMILLA, not to disconty∣nue her custome of repaire to her lodginge, whereunto shee condiscended and retired to the pallais of her father leauing CORNELIA in disputacion with her selfe what aunswere to forge to her desolate brother, who assone as he vnderstode of the retire of his mistres, addressed him to his syster, whom because he sawe in the attire of sorow I meane her eyes ba∣thed in ye teares of her late repulse, he gaue iudgement yme∣diatlie vppon the case with firme prerswacion that CAMIL∣LA did not onely denie his requeste, but also misliked wyth ye messenger in performing her promise, the force of which conceites draue him into a passion of alterations and change of collour, not without some argumente of mortall perill to his person, afore he demaunded to heare the aunswere, which being not vnmarked of ye girle, she preuented thoffer of further daunger, with a contrary of that which CAMIL∣LA tolde her, and for feare of further inconuenience by hys soddayne traunce declared vnto him, that albeit his mistres was not so quick of conset, as hisextremitie required, yet her hart was not so hard frozen, but there were meanes to thawe it, neyther was her aunswere without hope, although at the firste shee seamed to obiecte the disloyalety and ordenarye fic¦cyon of men, willinge hym for the rest to abandon dispaire, and arminge him selfe with corage, to dysmisse his solytarie and sauage order of lyfe, wherin for a more increase of vn∣certeyne consolation she tolde him that albeit it was as yet but the foxemone, and that he had no reason to aduaunce hym selfe so farre as to craue mutuall conferrence, yet he nede not forbeare, to write to her, and that wyth the consent of tyme and place she woulde deliuer the letter, wyth inde uor to bringe her last resolution, wher with albeit shee sea∣med only to feede the tyme wyth intente to make hym dis∣contynue
his fancies, attempting notwithstandinge a won∣derfull ympossibilitie for that hee was so stalled in his ama∣rus golphe, that al the pilottes belonginge to the infynit ga∣lies of VENICE lackt force to hale hym out, yet seamed she thereby to breathe an ayre of freshe comforte into all the partes of her languishinge brother, who likinge her aduise determyned to put her councell in execution, whervppon as one of superficiall skil in writinge thytalyan verse, he com∣posed a certeine ELEGIE conteynynge the some of his so∣rowe and substance of his request, whereof because I haue not the true copie, I leaue it to the iudgemente of theim that haue redd it, but thus much I presume of his sorowe, that he did not ende his epistle with out an infynitie of teares, ym∣partinge the wateris dewe of the same on diuerse partes of the paper, to thende the same mighte argue to his Ladie the dollor of his passion that gouerned him duringe the tyme of that contemplacion, which approued sufficientlye his follie wyth declaracion howe well they be beguenned that be coyf∣fed wyth a night capp of suche stoofe as wrapped the emptie heade of our LYVYO who failed not the nexte daye to dely∣uer his tragicall letter to his syster with great charge of ex∣pedicion in presenting it to his mistres. (CORNELIA here was doble passioned, both to see her brother perseuer in his follie, without intermission of tormente; and also that shee was forced to performe a seconde embassage to her, whose companie and frendshippe shee was sewer to abandon for e∣uer, if she added newe tearmes to her former requeste, but if she had bene aswel seene in the subtilities of loue, as she sea∣med moste simple in experience in that arte, she would haue considered, that what angrie clowdes soeuer appeare in the face of women, yet take they a singuler pleasure to be cour∣ted, and are not so angrie in deede as their countenance doth argue, when their seruauntes do visit theim with letters of humylitie. And differringe in this sorte certeine dayes the de¦lyuerie of the letter, fearinge that whych happened, that yf CAMILLA refused to performe theffecte, the daunger of her.
brother colde be no lesse, then either presente death by dispai∣re, or at the leaste to enter in some mortall sicknes, yet be∣inge pressed with his contynuall ymportunyties, the pore girle determyned to trye she forde and sounde eftesones the harte of CAMILLA who (as it chaunced) came the same after none to see CORNELIA, wher after they had made an expe∣rience of their skil in a banquet of curious cōfections, COR∣NELIA not vnmindful of the disease of her brother, and seing thoffer of oportunitie for that the place was voide of ympe∣dimente of companie sauinge the two girles, drewe the let∣ter out of her poket and with a smilinge regarde, nterme∣dled with honeste shame, gaue it to CAMILLA, desieringe her to reade it, and iudge what bee the follies of louers, CA∣MILLA ymagynynge by and by from what parte thimbas∣sage was sente, tolde her in sorte of pleasante anger that as she was not ignorante in the meanyng of that misterie and that if it were not more for the respecte of the bringer, then disier to contente hym that sente it, and that she was passed the feare of any charme conteyned in the same, shee woulde cōmitte it to a thousande morselles in her presence, So if the readinge broughte cause of miscontentment, she gaue her assurance to performe thuttermoste of her former pro∣misse. CORNELIA alledged ignoraunce in the matter, one∣ly sayth she I can thus far assure you that I haue not in char∣ge to presente you wyth letter or message from any man, for as I founde it this morninge vppon the steares goinge oute of my chamber, so I hope you will neither enioyne me blame nor penaunce for the falte wherin myne ynnocencye is su∣ficiente to cleare me. Well well sayeth CAMILLA, I will not sticke to giue you the readinge of these amarus lyues ar∣guinge as small pleasure to hym that write theym, as e∣uill receiued of me to whom they are dressed, wherwith she o∣pened the pacquett and redd the roll from hone ende to tho∣ther, wherin albeit she discouered in her fāce a singler plea∣sure begynning euen nowe to fele the motions of loue with in her tender breast, and taste of the appetit of a desier which she durst not satisfy, yet vsing her accustomed wisedome in
conceylinge that she desired moste, she couered the suspicion of affection with certeine tearmes of reproché which she bes∣towed vpon her simple companion in this sort: I finde nowe sayeth shee that my pacience and facilitie in hearynge your reaportes, do yelde you to muche fauor in furtheringe your fonde practise, which you nede not go about to coollour with other enamell then the complection of your owne nature, se¦inge, that she wyth whom you haue to do, can spie a flee in ye milke, and giue iudgemente of thintente of these baites wyth theffecte of your meanyng, desiering you (for preuen∣tyng a further inconuenience in your brother to seke to cure his disease as you may, leaste in contynuinge his follie, hee further a subuercion of that which is the beste parte in him for he hathe alreadye of me asmuch as he may hope for with assurance, And for your part▪ as you seame to reappose nei∣ther religion nor vertue in promisses, for that the laste tyme, we weare in tearmes of these follies, you gaue me assurance to discontinue thenterprise, So it is I that am readie to giue punyshmente to mine owne indiscretion, and endure the pe∣nance of mine owne rashenes, in depriuinge me of the com∣panie wherin I tooke moste pleasure and contentmente, bid∣dinge you fare well till better occasions maye restore oure famyliar visitacions, wherwith she put no difference betwen doing and sayinge, fearing that if she had attended the replie of CORNELIA, she had bene in daunger to yelde to the bar∣gaine, in openynge her eares to wide to the perswacions of her companion, whome she left no lesse astonied, then her selfe traunsed and full of diuerse ymagynacions, begin∣nyng euen then to measure thaffection of IVIO, and giue iudgement of his loyaltie by the contynuacion & vehemencie of his passion, with absolute resolucion (for al her dissymuled disdayne) to change purpose and admitt the offer of his frend shippe, if she were eftsones required by hym or any in his be halfe, blamynge her rashenes in reprochinge hys syster, and crueltie more thenne: conueniente to her brother, who beganne euen nowe to take possession of her thoughtes,
and make hym selfe a secrete mediator in his owne cause, wherein sewerly may be noted in experience of the fragilitie and inconstante disposition of man, and specially in thaffai∣res of loue, seynge that shee whiche earste detested euerye waye to be pertaker of suche ympression, is now chaunged in a momente and broughte to laie her heade vnder the yoke of seruile affection, makinge (as it were) a simple and plaine ta∣ble of her harte, to thende to drawe thereupon a forme of thoughtes and ymagynacions in diuerse collours according to the direction of hym that thus hath gott the gouernement of her libertie, with authoritie to dispose of her as hee thin∣kes good, And yet I cannot but allowe her longe delaie, and iudge her of greate wisedome to suspende her consente till she had wel considered of the matter, seinge the dailie incon∣ueniences happeninge to suche as neyther carefull of their honor, nor curious of their quiet, do admit indescretly the bar¦gaine at the fyrste offer, without knowinge the merite of the persones, or examynynge the circum stancye of the future sequeile of theyr loue, wherof are deriued so many examples of a nomber of miserable men endinge their liues by vnhap¦pie dispaire, whose wretchednes ought to warne vs to deli∣brate at large afore we put in execution, and to vse a reasona∣ble meane in our doinge, I meane not to ron hedlonge into the golphe of affection, leaste our daunger be equal to the peryl of ye infortunate ACARESTRYANS who because they were disfaudred of their ladyes, entered into such conceites of mortall grefe, that when they would willinglie haue re∣tired and bene deliuered, it was eyther ympossible or at least veraie hard to giue theym remedy, to whych crew of despe∣rate louers we may wel add the desaster of thys LIVIO who assured of thaunswere of his Ladie, as well by hys sister, as also by the regards of disdayne he noted in her farewell whē she departed (whereof he was partaker by shrowdinge hym¦selfe in a secrette corner of the chamber duringe the perley of the two maydes) fel ymedyatelye into so strange a sickenes that aband onynge at the fyrst the desyer of slepe, wyth the
appetit of the stomacke he lefte the phizicions at thende of their wittes: who beynge voyde of skill to cure hys disease tolde hys frendes that if he woulde not receiue compfort of hym self, his life was in hazarde, for that hys euill proceded onely of passions and inwarde sorowe of the harte, wherein they had reason seynge that the disease of loue is contrarye The disease of Loue con¦trary to the disposition of other griues. to the disposition of all other greues, for as there is no dis∣tresse what extremitie so euer it importe but it maye be ey∣ther cured or qualefied by certaine drogues and confections deuised by art to compforte the stomake and restore the hart to a gladnes, so the pacient plunged in the passions of the mynde, can neyther broke thassistance of Phizicke nor ope∣racion of hearbes, onely the presence or simple worde of hys mistres, hath more power ouer hys euill, then all the misti∣call or artificiall powders deuised by the moste experte phizi∣cions that euer cam out of thuniuersity of PARIS or PADVA whereof thexperience apperes in this LIVIO, who langui∣shynge euery daye from euill to worse, consumed by pece∣meale with the force of his amarous fier, no lesse then the snow lying vpon the syde of a mountaine yeldes and wastes with the heate of the son, which also forced such inward grefe to his sorowefull sister together with dispaire of any meane to restore hym for that CAMILLA discontinued her repaire to vysitt her, that she yelded tribute to his passion with a dy∣sease of equall mortalitie impartynge suche alarams of dol∣lor thorowe all the partes of her bodye that she was constrai∣ned to kepe her bead in a litle cabynett ioyninge to the lod∣ginge of LIVIO, who by the thinnes of the wall (which only deuided their chambers) was pertaker of the leaste worde that was spoken in the lodgynge of hys sister, whose gre∣uous groanes forced by the violence of a burnynge feuer gaue such increase to the daunger of LIVIO, that he was at point to yelde to the laste alaram of life, if the sicknes of his sister had not broughte the spedye remedye of hys dysease, for CAMILLA, astonied without measure that she neyther
mette CORNELIA at the churche, sawe her at the gate nor wyndowe nor any assemblye what soeuer, learned so much by inquisicion that she was aduertised of the mortall daun∣ger of LIVIO, together wyth thertremitye of hys syster, who (yf they were not reskewed by greate merueyle) were at poynte to be shrined together at one instante in theyr fa∣tall tombe. Here CAMYLLA, began to recante her aun∣cient creweltye, for in ceassynge any longer to dissimule her secrett affection to her LIVIO, and the sorowe shee suffe∣red for thafiction of hys syster, she seamed to purifie the wronge shee hadde donne to theym bothe thorowe a ryuer of affected teares distillynge by suche aboundance from her watery eyes, that she seamed at the poynte to visitt the pur∣gatorye of thother woorlde, to doo penaunce for the twoe euilles whereof she confessed her selfe to bee thonlye occa∣sion, wherein after she hadde spente certainne howers in publicke complainte, whose dollour seamed of force to moue the heauens to teares, and staye the course of the sonne fea∣lynge still an increase of passion by the vehemencye of loue: shee was constrayned to abandon the place, and performe the reste of her exclamacion agaynste her crueltie all alone in her chamber with thys tearmes. What furye or force in∣fernall is thys whyche shakyng the fortresse and most con∣stante parte in me hathe made me in one moment, yelde to that wherin I haue bene hitherto inuincible? is it possible a∣las, that, that whyche I iudged a dissembled passion in thys The cōplaint of Camylla. infortunat Gentleman shoulde torne to a true effecte of vn∣dowted faith confirmed by the power of that whiche we call loue in the hartes of men? why haue not I considered, that the horse whyche is of noble corage willbe gouerned by the shadowe of a Rodde, where the dull beaste is skarcely stur∣red with the princkyng of the spurres, the fearefull dogge doth also barke more then bite, and depest riuers do ronne with leaste noyse, so nature hathe imparted a peculiar in∣stinct to the noble minde not only to be more delicate in diet,
and ardante in affection, but also to embrase the obiecte of their fancie with a more vehemencie of desite and passion, then the rest of the rude and grosse sorte, who are not wor∣thy to be partakers of the misteries in true loue: Ah LIVIO LIVIO howe doo I feele a mocion of that whych I can not tearme other wayes, then a free force without constrainte, and a dollour without cause of complainte? for I am possest with an euill wherein I take pleasure; and feeles an expe∣rience of a paine without the which I thinke the lyfe of man can hardely be sustained, and yet my mynde wauereth in suche dredefull conceites, that I feare to make declaracion of that which bothe law of loue and dutie of my conscience bindes me to expose for the solace and relyefe of thy presente affliction? but alas the renoume of myne honeste name is so deare vnto me that I wyshe rather to embrase the extreme panges of death, then giue one symple occasion of discredit to mine auncient vertue, for that as mans wisdome is hable to supplie ye losses of all other thinges so it is not only vnfur∣nished of meanes to restore the forfait of our honestye, but also voyde of arte to couer the falte of so greate an offence, but is it a iuste imputation or worthye falte, when in our busynes wee respecte vertue, and concludes the ende of our enterpryse wyth an honeste meanynge? ys it not a deede of compassion to gyue soccours to hym that standes in watter vpp to the throte, and at the pointe to peryshe for want of help, what can we do lesses then be careful to re∣couer hym who offereth hys lyfe in the sacrefise of affection for our sakes? who can iustly tearme our doynges by the title of offence, when we yelde a mutual amitye to hym that pursueth our goodwill wyth a respecte and intente of law∣full mariage, no, no, CORNELIA thowe shalte not lose thy brother, nor I the companie of so deare a frende for lacke to aunswere in reciprocal wil to him who with the peril of his life cōceiles the argument of hys sorow, Ah most constant &
loyall LYVIO, seyng the reputacion of myne honour de∣nieth me accesses and cōference with the, and ye shame doth close my mouthe from discouerynge the secret of my good meaning towardes ye, take courage, & discharg thou thoffice of a bolde soliciter to her that is no lesse readye to graunte, then thou meritorious to haue, and dispoiled alreadye of all hagarde crueltie, is not onely prest to reknowledge the ho∣nour whyche thou offreste me, but also whollye framed to the POSTEY and appetit of thy will, and nowe do I fele, that againste the force and power of loue, the strongest resi∣staunce is to weake, neyther is the whole worlde of suffi∣cient strength to put to vtteraunce the soldiours whome he preferreth in the feylde, whereof who is a more late expe∣rience then my selfe, who earste defyinge hys malice, am nowe to attende vpon the chariott of hys triumphe and yeld me prisonner to hym, who beyng hither unto my bondman, hathe nowe made me the slaue of his importunat requestes. And seynge the sentence is alredye paste, and confirmed by the voice of my destymes, why do I conceile my passion in the myddest of a thousande flames whiche tormentes me within, or why do I dissemble that, I desire moste, or retire myne eyes from the view wherein they chieflye delite? why do my feete staye to transporte thys body to the place, where the harte hath already taken possession, wherwith she deter∣myned the spedye consolation of LYVIO, wyth no other drogue or confection, then a free consente of her loue, yf the same were eftesoones demaunded, and there vppon collo∣red her goynge to hys logynge to see CORNELIA, whome as shee founde in her bedde wythe more argumentes of deathe then apparance of lyfe, by reason of a generalle weakenes whyche hadde mortyfyed the whole strengthe of her body, so she hadde not spent in any wordes in the con∣solation of her companion, but LIVIO (smellynge as it were) the presence of hys ladye asked hys syster who was wyth her, who aunswered that onely CAMYLLA kepte
her companye, wherewith forcing a supplie of courage in his fainte harte, with intente to knowe the fynall areste of his lyfe or death, began to plede wyth hys absent mistres in this sorte. Yf there be any hope in extremetye, or expe∣ctacion of helpe in mortall distresse, it is tyme nowe (good Liuio at the poīt of death speaketh to his misters. madam) to conuerte your Auncient crueltie into an humour of compassion: both to defende your self from thymputacion of a tyrant, and my lyfe from a wretched ende of miserable dispair: ceasse hensfurthe to dissymule thuttermost of your rigour, or drop of present grace, seinge that both the one and the other hath indiffrent power to releue my distresse eyther by death in denieng me your fauour, or contynuance of longer lyfe by impartyng your specialle grace: come cruell misters and see thy vnfortunate LIVIO without hart, hope, or argument of longer breathe, yf by a promisse of thy good will, thou breathe not an ayre of freshe consolacion and by the sommaunce of thy worde reuoke my dyeng mynde from thys tombe of myserable dispaire where in I feele my self so tormented with thofficers of deathe, that nature ceassyng to supplie my weary partes with force, I fynd an impossibi∣litie in my tonge to obey any longer the desyers of my hart, wherewith his breath began to drawe short staying the cour∣se of further speche, yf not that in entryng into hys fatall traunce he exposed certeine dolefull groanes, whyche caused bothe the younge Ladies to Ronne in haste to the succour of the patient, whome they founde stryuinge with thextre∣metie of hys laste pange, albeit not without some litle perye of breathe, whyche he seamed to reserue wyth greate diffi∣cultie, whereuppon CAMYLLA seynge a prouffe of his con∣stancie euen to the laste moment, and hauynge but one meane to releue hys traunce, made no conscience to lett fall her rosye and courrall lyppes vppon the mortifyed mouthe of her diynge LIVIO who receyued suche present consola∣ciō by thys offer of fauour vnloked for, that ye force of nature and vitall strengthe ready to depart out of euery vayne of
hys bodye retired to theyr auncient places, wherewith he vsynge the benefytt of his fortune, forgatt not to embrase his Ladye, with an infinite of kysses, whereof shee resto∣red hym a double interest, albeit because he shoulde make no greate proffytt of thys soddayne courtesye, and to preuent with all a suspicion of lyghte behauiour in her self, she vsed her accustumed wysdome, entering into familiar conferen∣ce in thys sort. I hope SEIGNEVR LIVIO you will not conuert thys compassion whych I haue vsed in the rappeale of your mortall farewell into any synister opinion of the di∣minucion of thintegretie of CAMILLA who as longe as she lyueth will so stande vppon the garde of her honour and honest renowme, that no degree shall haue iuste cause to re∣prehende the leaste fauor shee extendes to any man, in why∣che conceyte, I am also content to impart a credyt to your loyaltie, perswadynge the same to bee without fiction whereof I am no lesse glade, then I hope the loue whyche youe beare me is chaste and of honest intent, respectynge an ende of sinceritie, for yf I sawe any lykelyhodd to the con∣trary and that a dyseordinat wyll did guide your desyer, and were the cause of your passion, assure your selfe I woulde make lesse conscience to committe me to the mercye of the moste horrible tourmentes in the worlde, eye and perill of present deathe, then to lease anye parte of that whyche ma∣kes me marche without blushynge amongest the beaste of oure contrey: in whyche respect wyth full perswacion of a sincere simplicitie in your loue, I can not but retourne you a semblable fauour, with absolute assuraunce from thys in∣staunte of such firme affection and zeale as any ladye oughte to impart to hym who seekes her frendshyppe in sorte of honeste and lawfull mariage, neyther shall yt dekaye after theffect of desyer be parformed nor dymynishe by any syni∣ster accident vntill the fatall sequestracion of our sowle and bodye, whereof lette vs vse wisdome in the conueyghe of suche affaires as maye bee taken bothe in good and euyll
parte, to thende that the maiestye of the hyghest beyng not offended, our honour fall not into the slaunder of the worlde wherein for a first charge to bee comitted to your diligence, and with all to prefer an assured effect of the vehemencie of your affection towardes me, dispose your self to demaunde me of my Father whose consent you shall fynde me to con∣firme in such sorte as your selfe shal deuise. Arme your selfe then with compfort and retire to healthe, at the request of her, who takynge no pleasure in solitarie regardes, wisheth you to reserue this precious flower of your youth for other exercises, then to wast with passions of desperacion no lesse enemies to the strenghte of the bodye, then hurtefull to the healthe of the sowle, and seynge besides, that in the recouery of you, consistes the healthe of your syster suspende no lon∣ger the consolacion of her and contentement of your selfe and me, who in attendynge your expedicion to procure the goodwill of my father, will dispose my selfe in the meane while to bee thankefull vnto you any waye wherein myne honour and honestye will iustifie my doynge: whiche laste wordes seamed of suche operation in the traunsed mynde of LIVIO, that discharged (as it were) of a perillous vision in a dreame lyfted vp hys eyes and handes towardes heauen, yeldyng honour to the goddes for hys happye encounter, and kyssynge the white and delycate hande of hys newe my∣stresse, he forgatt not to gyue her suche humble thankes as the greatenes of hys felicitie required, whych seamyng to hym to excede the compasse and power of fortune, iudged it rather the vertue of a dyuyne miracle then an effect mor∣tall, for that in so soddayne amoment he was acquited of so perentory a daunger, assuring her that assone as health and strengthe of body woulde assyste the desyer of his mynde, he would performe her comaundement in demaundynge her fathers consent, wherein he hoped to delay no long time, for that he felte a wonderful approche of health by the viewe of her presence in his late & last storme of afflictiō I wold do no lesse (saith she) then yelde you soccours in so great an extre∣mitie
both to delyuer my selfe out of payne in seinge you passioned, and also to qualifye the greffe of my deare com∣panion your syster, to whom you are also bounde in some sorte to be thankeful for my commynge hether: For albeit my conscience sommoned me to a compassion of your tor∣ment with desier to yelde you the due hyer and consideraciō of the honest loue you beare me, yet ye regarde of mine ho∣nour deniynge me to visite you, seamed an impediment to theffect of that, wherunto I was bounde by so many dueti∣full merites, prayinge you for ende to excuse that whiche is past, and pardon me for the present, in that I can not assiste you with longer companye, persuadyng thy selfe (my deare LYVIO) that althoughe my bodye muste supplye an other place to coullour the trafficque of our loue, and pre∣uent suspicion, yet thou hasts made suche a stealth of my hart that the same will not fayle to kepe the companye in my absence: wherewith takynge her leaue with a chaste kysse, of her seruant, and frendlye farewel to CORNELIA, she retireth to her fathers Palais leauynge her louer well lightned of all his cares, sauyng of a necessarye meane to sounde the good will of the olde REINALDO wherin not∣withstandynge he vsed suche expedicion of diligence, that afore hymselfe could enioye the benefyt of perfect health, he procured certaine auncient Gētlemen his neare parents to performe his reqneste to thold niā, whom they solicited with suche instance & in sorte of mariage, that he admitted theyr offer, and confirmed the bargaine with theis wordes, that onely LIVIO shoulde be the firste that should renounce the bale, albeit saith he because of thinfirmitie of mine age, I vse the cōsent of my son in all my affaires of importance, so I craue onely your patience in the fynall conclusion of the mariage til his retourne frō Rome, at which time only your selues shal name the day of consommation: in this aunswere albeit appeared an impediment to the performance of the mariage, for that (as you haue harde) CLAVDIO enuyed the state of LIVIO, which argued a difficultie in him to approue
shallyance, yet CAMILLA vnderstanding the resolution of both their parentes, gaue as sewer iudgemente of the mari∣age, as if it had bene alredie published in the churche, and therupon began to enlarge her familiar hawnte and repairs to LIVIO whom if she embrased afore with earneste zeale, it was nothinge in respectt of the vehemencie of her present affection, which also deuyded hymselfe into such a SYMPA∣THIA and equalitie of loue in theim bothe, that it spredde abrode by indiffrent braunches in bothe their hartes, like as the morninge son in the easte giueth by litle and lytle conty∣nuall encrease to his beames comforting the creatures vp∣pon earth. And in this often enterviewe together, LYVIO, enioyenge nowe his auncient health and dexterytie of body, being one daye (amongest the rest) with his lady in the cham ber of his syster toke his lute and songe a ditie whiche hee had made of their reciprocall passion, wyth suche contente∣mente to hys CAMILLA, that she desired hym eftesones to repaite it in semblable note, aswel for the delyte of the tune, which he performed with a voice to her contentacion, as al∣so the subtill stile and fyne conueighe of the matter, argu∣inge a conclucion of that which they bothe wished wyth e∣quall appitit, seinge that as their continuall haunt and fre∣quentacion together, gaue increase to their desyer, so they were both of opynion, that loue colde not beare the title of perfecte affection, if theffect of that whych was indiffrently wished of theim both, did not make perfect the thyng which hithervnto was debated but by wordes, other wayes that whiche was passed betwene theim, beinge but a naked loue whithout effecte, other then certeine delicate kysses whyche serued rather to kyndle the coales of desyer, then quenche the flame alredye burning within their intralls seamed but a simple platte or playne table, whiche the conninge pain∣ter hath smothed for the nonst to drawe some ymage of ex∣quisytt skille, wherein being ouercharged with intolleracion of desyer, and fynding thabode of CLAVDIO longer thenne they ymagined, they passed vnhappely a pryuye contracte
betwene shem selues, with erspectaciō to consomat the ful of ye matter with a due hyer of ye paines they indured indiffrent∣ly in attendinge, an effecte of their pleasure at the retorne of CLAVDIO from Rome. But here fortune began to presente her selfe vppon the stage, as one that wilbe knowen to beare a swaighe in the good happe or infelicitie of man, and vs of suche vnconstante and malicious regard towardes vs, that when we thinke we bee paste the feare of all perill, and trod∣den all desasters vnder our féete, it is then that we fynd least assurance in the thinges wherein we reapposed our chiefest pleasure, and in the turninge of her weale is figured the alte racion of oure wordlie affaires. I meane by a conuersion of thinges which earste seamed pleasant and delicat, into a taste ercedinge the bitternes of gal, in such sorte, that often tymes wée fynde deathe of more easye burden then wée are hable to beare the panges whiche ordenarilye attende the flatteries of this vncerteine FORTVNE, whom the Poetes and pain∣ters (not wythout cause haue drawen in ye picture of a blynd woman standing vppon a tickle staie of an vnconstant globe or bowle representinge thereby her fragilitie, and how blind lye she guides the thinges of ye world, what authorities colde & inferr to exclaime agaynst her mobylitie, if it were not for the shortnes of tyme and that I wil not cloye your memory, wyth so tedious a discourse howe manye haue wee féene at the point to enioye a monarkye, kingdom or siegneury, who when they leaste thought of commutacion or change, haue loste their honoure, expulsed their estates, and at laste ended their lyues by a miserable death. Who haue redde the sixte. booke of VALERIVS MAXIMVS may iustefye my opynion by thexample of QVINTVS SCIPIO a valiant capteyne and consull in Rome, who, longe tyme hauinge fortune at com∣maundement Quintus Sci∣pio was seene in a moment cut in morselles ser∣uinge as vnworthie foode to the rauenouse beastes issuinge oute of the sauage desarts RADAGASO sometime king of the GOTHES for all thassuerance he reapposed in his inuin∣cible armye (as he thought) was not expempted frome the
dome of inconstante and mortall destynie, for that his people slaine, his capteines fled, and he taken prysoner, passed vnder the sentence of an infamous deathe by STILICON generall of tharmye at that time for themprour HONORIVS, wyth other infynit proffes of antiquitie, wherwith it is no neede to fyll my paper, seinge the domesticall accedentes and like chaunces happeninge amongest our neighboures at hoame, do giue sufficient testymonye and faithe of that whiche wee go aboute to proue. And nowe beinge vpon the discourse of LIVIO and his vnfortunat CAMILLA, who albeit were ney ther princes nor gouernors of kingdomes, yet beinge in the paradise of their pleasure and at the pointe to performe the last acte of their delytes, encountred in one moment a chang and synister subuercion all contrarye to the appointmente whiche they had resolued vpon their future mariage, And se∣wer it is an argumēt of the greatest folly that can bée to pro∣misse our selues an assurance of thinges whiche depende vp∣pon the will and dispocition of an other, vppon whiche the yssue is also most vncerteine, for that differing frō vs in coun cell and ymaginacion, they are also without care in what sort wée take their iudgement, seinge they depende no waye vpō vs nor our fancy: like as it happened to these .ii. infortu∣nat louers for CLAVDIO nowe retorned, and not likinge any way thallyance betwene LYVYO and sister wrought so muche with his father (who sawe not but by the eyes of his son, nor attempted any thinge wherinto CLAVDIO added not the conclusion that REINALDO renounced the words of his former consent pacifyenge the parents of LIVIO, by the beste parswacions he cold ymagyn, with thanks to the yong man equal to the greatnes of the honor whtche he offred in seking to be his son in law Theis newes were no soner ym∣parted to our ii. louers, but it is to be thoughte they escaped not without sondrye alarams of mortall grefe, whiche had dismissed their passions with the ende of their lynes; if it had not bene for the offer of a simple hope wherupon they groun∣ded a new consolaciō for yt they exspected at length a remorce
in tholde man (by reason of his promisse) to iustefye the con∣tract alreadie passed betwene theim two, wherof CAMILLA as pinched wyth a grudge of more wronge then thother, for that she sawe the vniuste malice of her brother was thonly staie of theffecte of her determynacion entred into a passion of suche frettinge conceites tempered wyth a mortall hate to CLAVDIO, an indissoluble zeale to her seruante, and a iuste dispite agaynst the debylitie of her father, that she was at the point to vse force agaynst her selfe, and aduance thef∣fect yf their malice by her vntymely death, wherein because she woulde not discouer openly, that which was not yet dou∣ted of any, shee retired to a moderation in her greefe till the firste parte of the eueninge beyng spent, the desier of sleepe somoned euery man to wythdraw hymselfe to his lodginge when she in her chamber wyth thonly company of her womā began to burst out into newe termes of complainte cursing the hower of her birthe, accusinge the weaknes and wante of corage in her father, but chiefely enueihed againste thun∣happie arryuall of her brother in thys sorte. What iniustice The compla∣inte of Ca∣milla. or crueltie is this of the heauens to giue vs a harte to chuse and libertie to loue one of equall desyer and semblable will and then to bar vs the priuiledge of that fredom in not ma∣kinge a perfection of that whych nature hath sett abroche in vs by the communyon and coniunction of our thoughtes? is it reason the bodye be more respected then the mynde, in that the harte and inwarde partes making a choice of affecti∣on sholde not haue authorytie to sommon the bodye as their subiecte to obey thinstinctes and suggestions of the spirite, nature sewer doth abuse her reputacion in this case to coyfe her creatures with thattyre of loue, makynge a mutuall con¦sente in both parties and then to denie the consommacion of the thinge her selfe did fyrst begyn in vs? from whence co∣mes thiniquitie of that lawe which alloweth a father for his pleasure only and with out iustice to force an inclynacion of his children to that which is neither necessarye nor conueni∣ente for theim? is it not sufficient alas that we yelde theym
honoure, with the tribute of our dutie and seruice, that wee giue soccour to their olde yeres, and attempte nothing with∣out their consent, but that wee muste be subiect to a further tyrannye in performinge the sentence of their thraldom al∣thoughe it dyffer whallye from our will and choice? And if mariage be a free coniunction, dependinge vppon an vnytie or conformetie of both partes, how can I refuce that wherof is passed alredye a confirmacion, or admit other husband thē hee to whom I ham bounde by vowe of consente. A H this is one of the frutes of tyrannouse loue, to worke the effecte of a consente betwene vs, withoute leauinge vs a meane to brynge the same to perfection, or suffer vs to consider whether the parties knitt together by vnytie of affection in spirite, might also be assisted with a coniunction of the bodies without offence to god or the worlde, but what? why do I en∣ter into tearmes of iustice wyth hym, who is no way parta∣ker of reason, and who is so soddaine and vncerteine in his Loue is na∣ked and vvith out eyes enterprises, that he neyther takes aduise afore he strike, nor vseth leasure to delyberat or foresee the successe of any thing he beginneth, for as he is naked and without eyes, so is hee boyde of iudgement, and vnconstante in all his doings, assai∣linge commonly the hartes of suche as hee fyndes ydle and leaste occupyed with vertue: Ah spiteful disdayne of kynred, and vnnaturall malice of a brother, in what sorte haue I de∣serued this harde pennance at thy hande, to depryue me of the thinge wherin I tooke moste pleasure, wherein hath the curteyse LIVIO, offended the, if not that his honestie excedes thy rude disposition, and vertue giueth cause of shame to thy wicked will, or paraduenture thou disdainest his iust merit, for that he is better fauored in al companies then thy selfe? And is it reason that thy consente confirme my affection? why sholde my aduancement depende vppon thy good wyll, or the choice of my husbande aske councell of thy consente? shall I be subiecte to hym who hathe no authoritye ouer me, but by an encrochement of yeres, for that he is the eldest son of my father? hath he any pryuiledge that waye, to gouerne
my will, or geue lawes to my fancie, nothinge lesse, for my father hath alreadie paste thaccorde betwene LIVIO and me but you wyll saye paraduenture vnder a condicion, a simple article I confesse, whiche also is of no force, if the partie bee voide of pretence of preiudice? And wherin shall it be eyther preiudiciall or proffitable to him, if LIVIO be my husbande? seinge it belongeth to my father to depart with my dowery and porcion of mariage, and my husbande to dispose it with∣out interuption so longe as hee is a member of lyfe, what weakenes is this in a father to be gouerned whollye by the breath of his son, whose vniuste malice rather then argumēt of reason makes him renownce the worde of his honour in a case touchinge the quiett and consolation of her, who ought to be no lesse deare vnto him, then her tyrannouse bro¦ther, who when he hath exposed the vttermoste effecte of his spite, & that I am to be bestowed in an other place by his ap∣pointment, it shall appeare whether his commaundemente be as currante ouer mée then, as his malice rageth without measure or reason at this present, protestinge by the height of the heauens, that none other then hee to whom I haue pawned my faieth shall enioye the chaste acquaintance of thinfortunat CAMILLA: no LIVIO is myne, what wrong soeuer they do to our vertuese loue, whiche so longe as I liue shalbe in dyssoluble in me, beinge readye withall to refuce no thinge that may aduance the consommacion of the mariage betwene me and him without whom I fele an ympossibily∣tie to liue: wherwith her passion grewe to suche a vehemen∣cie, that her laste wordes ended with the course of longer breathe, in such sorte that shee slyded soddainly from the seat wher she sate, and fell grouelinge vppon the grounde, resi∣gning with a dollorous skryke the vse of vitall ayre, albeit the expedition of diligence in her womā procured with much ado a retorne of life, and with such consolacion and offer of hope as shee colde preferre, shee won her to go to bedde, where albeit the viewe of the wronge and discurtesye of her brother seamed for a tyme to staie the course of sleepe, yet
in the often repeticion of her sorowes appeared a litle of qui ette, whiche closed her eyes and cast her into a slomber wher in she seamed to beholde standing afore her thymage of her LIVIO halfe deade embrasing her with a pale and hydeous regarde, which forced her to suche a feare, that she brake sod∣dainely oute of her dredefull sleape, spendinge the reste of the wearye nighte in pytifull complaintes, wherin certeinly she had raison, for that in that dreame or rather misticall vi∣sion, was fygured the desaster whiche not longe after ouer∣whelmed theim bothe, neyther oughte wée to fynde it strang if thapprehensions appearing in our slepe, do geue vs war∣ninge, of the good or euill happeninge vnto vs, for that wée haue certeine recordes which iustefye the same in the person of one BRVTVS hee whiche was vanquished in the feldes of PHARSALEMO whether he were awake, or in the depthe Brutus vvar∣ned of his o∣uerthrovve in his sleepe. of his sleepe, seamed to see in his tente a terrible shappe of a certaine sprite pronouncinge his ouerthrow, besides thau∣shorytie of naturall reason mouethe vs to confesse, that as the ympression of a greate feare, or longinge desyer of any thinge do presente often tymes affore the eyes of our mynde (the bodie beinge in reste) the ymage of that whiche we loue or feare. So also the sprit that is voyde of passion, or at point to fall into some perilous accident, encountreth commonly in his sleape the thing which hee wisheth not to happen, and abhorreth to remember when his eyes haue dismissed the drowsy humor of slepe, for CAMILLA desiered nothing lesse then the death of her LYVIO, and yet not longe after the pre sage or forewarninge of her dreadefull vysion she only wit∣nessed the effect assistinge his funeral with her presence in the tombe, aswell as she was willynge to admit his compa∣nie in the secret bedd of their infortunat mariage. LIVIO for his part was not voide of passion on the behalfe of the fro∣warde successe of his busynes albeit seing he colde no way bribe the goodwill of fortune, hee resolued to geue place to her presente malice, and in attending the benefytt of a bet∣ter tyme, to practise CLAVDIO by circumstance and
mediacion of his neare frendes, Albeit felinge in the meane while an intolleracion of loue, with contynnall increase of desier to coll the flower of his affection and taste of the pleasant Iewyste of the grape which quencheth the thirste of the loyall louer, he ymparted his paine and request to his Ladye in a letter of this substance. Seinge there is no iustice good ladye to supporte the consent to your owne disquiet, and Lyuyo vvri∣teth to Cmil l. suffer me to lyue in passion without comparaison, methinke you do wronge to thindiffrent contentment of vs both? for if you desyer my death you nede vse no other minister for fa∣tall execution then the alarams of dollor which I encounter daily by your meanes, but if you haue care of my quiett, and greue no lesse with thimposicion of my mortal torment why make you suche conscience to yelde me consideration of the honeste zeale I beare you seing the same dothe also ymporte a speciall contentment to your selfe, you knowe what is al∣redie passed betwene vs, neyther are you ignorante of the small respect your parentes vse towardes you, wherwyth if the mutuall consente conclude the mariage, you ought also to vnderstande, that neyther the tyrannye of the one nor wante of corage in the other, hath power to wythholde you from that which you are bound to performe, nor hinder me to enioye the benefyt of my desert, wherin I appeale to the tooch of your consience, with request to consider in what sort you will aduise, mée to thende that by thassistance of your councell, I maye the better carye ouer the greatnes of my extremetie, which as it is deuided into spedie releefe or pre∣sente dispaire, so seinge I am of force to passe by the one I doubt of which of the two to make my moste proffyt, for al∣beit the firste hath power to performe the full of my felycity yet in attendinge theffect, I consume in a flame of burning desyer, and the other, if it ymporte a present abridgmente of my tormente by vntymely deathe, yet in the verye acte con∣sistes a spot of dishonour to my selfe, and an euerlastinge surname of crueltie to her in whose ballance waigheth thin∣dyffrent sentence of the lyfe or deathe of the moste desolate
and LOIALL LIVIO. CAMILLA whyche desired nothing lesse then to delay the desire of her seruant, for that her selfe labored of the same di∣sease, retorned ye messengier with no other aunswer, thē that at after dinner she would vysitt CORNELIA, when also shee wold satisfie his maister by mouth, for yt she feared ye subteltie of her brother wolde intercepte her letters where with thin∣fortunat LIVIO, not knowyng the thred of mischiefe which fortune was now spynnynge for him, entred into such solace that the chamber wherein he walked seamed to litle to con∣teine bys present gladnes, the rather for that he ymagined yt hys mistresse woulde now dismysse all excuses and impedi∣mentes to theffect of hys longe desyer, seynge there wanted nothynge to consommate the mariage, but solemne publica∣cion, in whiche passion of ioye he supplied the tyme in atten∣dynge the commynge of his Ladye with singynge and softe musicke, accordyng to the nature of the Swan, who the nea∣rer The propertie of the svvan beinge neare her deathe. she draweth to the ende of her destiny, the pleasanter note she synges, bathinge and pruninge her selfe in the purest streame she can fynde, to thende to do honor to her funerall ate: and as he ymagined thus to be at the point to arriue in the subburb of his paradise, behold the approch of ye goddesse of his deuocion & deare mistres CAMILLA with her Cham∣briere, who as she was alredye priuye to the whole practise: So she vsed her companie nowe to auoyde suspicion, impar∣ting the same to LIVIO, to thende he nede not distruste her presence, yf by chaunce they entred into parley touchynge any secret matche where neded not thassistance of manye wytnesses. And being thus in armes together, God knoweth if anye sorte of kysses or other follies in loue were forgotten, wher∣in as it is a common experience, that neither bytt nor bridle is hable to gouerne the furye of loue, when we be at point to enioye the pleasures we desyer, so there appered suche an indifferent vehemencie of appetit betwene thei, that at thinstant they made a plat or begynnyng of that whiche the
same euenynge gaue ende to the pleasure and lyfe of theym both, wehrof CAMILLA as more hoate in desyer, or lesse hable to beare the burden of her burnyng affection, preuen∣ted the request of LYVIO and made plaine the first entrey & path to both their mishappes, saying that forasmuch as our consentes haue concluded a mariage, and that in the breache of our promisse appeareth a perentory preiudice to our con∣sciences, that we seale tharticles of the contract, wyth a ful consommation of the secret ceremonies in mariage, bothe to take awaye all occasion of offence, and also to mortifye the malice of my brother (maugre his hart) wherin sayth she beinge fully persuaded of youre consente to my proposition, and for that in cases of loue delayes and longe consulta∣tion Delaies be hurtefull in cases of loue bée hurtefull, and strre vp causes of displeasure to the hartes of suche as be striken with the same disease, wherof the contrarye, the reste of oure humaine affaires require a maturitie of councel, to thende the successe may aunswere therspectation of the parties, so I wishe you to attende the benefyt of time this euenynge, I meane at the hower of sup∣per, when men are gyuen least to suspicion, you faile not to come in as secret maner as you can to the gardeine gate, wher my woman shalbe readye to conueige you into my chamber, to thende we maye there take aduise of that which we haue to do, wherunto LIVIO was not curious in con∣sent, and lesse vnmindeful to yelde her the choice of a thou∣sande thankes for offringe the priuiledge which he doubted to demaunde, giuyng her assuraunce to vse suche exact wis∣dome in the conueyghe of so secret a misterie, that ARGVS himselfe, if he were vpō earth shold not descrye his cōming, & much lesse any be pryuye to the daunce, but such as perfor¦med the rounde, wherin he was not deceaued, for as he was the firste, so shee failed hym not at the cloase, and bothe theyr miseries of equall qualitie in the ende, like as it happenethe often times that those amarous bargaines redoundes to the harmes of suche, as bee the parties, who albeit do alledge a certaine respect of honestie in theyr
doinges, by pretence of mariage, yet God being the iudge of their offence, will not suffer the wronge to the obedience of their parentes in concludyng priuye contractes vnpunished, and that wyth suche a penaunce, as the remembrance is no∣torious in all ages. But now to our LIVIO who neyther vn∣mindeful of the hower, and lesse forgetfull to kepe appointe∣ment, attyreth himselfe for the purpose in a nighte gowne girt to hym, with a paire of shoes of felte, leaste the noyse of his féete shoulde discouer his goinge, and for a more honor of his mistres, he forgat not his perfumed shyrte, spidered with curious braunches accordinge the fansie of his Ladye, with his wrought coyffe poudred with diuerse drogues of delicat smell, wherewith he stealeth in as secret maner as hée can to the gate of appointement, where he founde the guide of his loue, whome hee embrased aswell for the seruice he founde in her, as also in that she resembled the beautye of his mistres CAMYLLA, who after she had taken her nightes leaue of her father and brother, with search that euery man was in his place of reste, retireth to her chamber with such deuociō as commonly they yt fynde themselues in semblable iorneye to worke theffect of such like desir, where encountering her infortunat seruant, it was concluded to imploye no time in vayne reuerence, or idle ceremonies, but in a moment they entred their fatal bed together, where af∣ter certaine amarous threates, and other folyes in loue (ser∣uyng as a preamble to the part they ment to playe) LIVIO entred into the vnhappye pageant of his fatal & last pleasure, wherin he chaffed hymselfe so in his harnesse, and was so gréedie to cooll the firste flower of the virginity of his CA∣MILLA, that whether the passion of ioye, preuailynge aboue ye force of the hart, and thinner partes smothered with heate, coulde not assiste thenterprise accordynge to their office, or that he exceded nature in surfettinge vpon his pleasant ban∣quet, he founde hymselfe so sharplye assayled wyth short∣nes of breath, that his vitall forces began to faile him in the middest of the combat, like as not longe since it
happened to ATTAL VS the cruell king of the HVNES, who in ye first nighte of his infortunat mariage in HVNGARYE The kinge of the hunes died in the excesse of pleasure vvith his vvife the first night of their mari∣age. enforced hymself to so greate a corage in the pleasaunt en∣counter wyth hys newe wyfe, that hys dead bodye (founde in her armes the nexte mornynge) witnessed his excesse and glottenouse appetit in the skirmyshe of loue, whyche also myghte bee the bane of thys LIVIO, who respectynge no measure in drinkynge of the delicat wyne, no more then yf it had bene but one banquet, dressed for hym in the whole course of his lyfe, was so ouer charged with desyre in that pleasaunt skirmishe that the conduites of lyfe stoppynge vppon a soddaine, barred to adde fourther strengthe to hys gredye appetyt, wherevppon he became without m ocion, or féelinge in the armes of CAMYLLA, who féelynge hym Livyo died of the like in the armes of his Camilla. without sence and that he seamed more heauy and rude vppon her then affore, dowted a trothe, wherin also she was fully satisfyed by the lyght of ye candle, which she caused her chamberiere to bringe to the bedde syde, where vewinge the dead bodye of him whom she loued no lesse then her self, and iudgyng the cause as yt was in deede, entred ymedyatly in∣to suche a mortall passion of dollour, that albeyt she woulde haue exposed some woordes of compassion on the behalfe of the pytefull accident, yet féelyng a generall dymynucion of force thorowe all her partes by thynnundacion or waues of soddaine sorowe, she founde her tonge not hable to supplye the desyer of her hart, whych wyth the consent of the reste, loathynge the vse of longer lyf, resigned her borowed tear∣me to the fates, fallynge at thynstant without sence or fée∣lynge vppon the dead body of hym whom shee accompted a dutye to accompanie in the other worlde, aswell as she de∣lyted in hys presence durynge their mutuall aboade in thys miserable valey. A happye kynde of deathe yf wee had not to consyder the perill whyche attendes suche wretches, as hauing no meane to performe theffect of their pleasure, but by vnlafull stealthe, are so franke for the shortnes of their
tyme that in satisfynge the glot of their gredye appetit they make no conscience to sacrifise ther owne lyfe: but yf wee passe furthe in the viewe of these offences, we shall fynde a derogacion of the honour and integretye of the mynde, with a manifest preiudice and hazarde to the healthe of the sowle, whyche makes me of opinion, that yt is the most, miserable ende that maye happen to manne, the rather for that the chyefest thynge whyche is regarded in the putsuet of that entreprise, is to obeye the sommance of a bestely and vnbridled luste of the fleshe, wherein I wyshe oure fran∣tike louers, whoe (makynge contemplacion vppon causes of loue) accomptes yt a vertue to ende their lyues in thys LASCIVIVS bonde of pryuye contract, to refrayne that whyche is so indifferent hurtefull bothe to the sowle and body, seynge theire death is not onelye without argument of desperation, but also their sowles moste sewer to receiue the guerdon of cyuil morder, whyche we oughte to feare and eschewe as neare as wee can afore the sequestration of the earthelye substance, from the part of diuinitie whyche wee partycipat with God, and what contentement or glorye so euer they reappose in thys monstrous abrydgement of na∣ture, reprehendynge theym of destoyaltie whyche do the contrarye, yet their acte merites none other name then the title of brutalitie, neyther can I thynke but their opynion is guided by some sprite or humor of frantyke follye, lyke as yt is not the part of a Christiā (as the Appostle affirmeth) to prefer the fyckle pleasures of the flesh, whych are of shor∣ter moment, then the thoughtes of a man, afore the feare of God, recke of our life, and care to present our sowles with out spot, afore the troane of mercie in the daye of generall accompte, when all thoughtes shalbee deciphered and no falte vnpunyshed: the poore girle of the chamber to the dead CAMILLA, seynge thys fatall misterye, wyth the distresse she was in, for that she was a companion of the conspiracye, thinkynge to giue ende and playe the laste acte of the trage∣dy,
serched about the chāber for some glaue or sword or other thinge apte to make the minister of her blody intent, & being deceaued that way, she had no other meane to playe doble or quit but with impetuosity of dollor, wherein she raged with such doleful skryches, that the brute of her cōplaint awaked the whole house, whereof the first that entred the chamber of funeralles was the tyraunt CLAVDIO whoa albeyt was thenly cause of this dolorous massacre, yet in place of confes∣syng his falte, or yelding sorow to the losse of such ij. loiall lo∣uers, he grewe in more rage by the viewe of the dead body of LIVIO, wherof as he would willingly haue cōmitted a new morder, sauing that he sawe him without respiration or ar∣gumēt of lyfe, so his anger being torned into wodnes, & rage into furye, he wreaked his collor vpon the poore girle to whome he gaue iij. or iiij. estockados with hys dagger tho∣rowe the bodye, and slonge ymediatlye oute of the chamber, to the greate amaze and terrour of hys vnfortunat father, who seynge hys house full of morders, and hys sonne com∣mitted oppen slaughter in the person of the innocent gyrle, coulde not so gouerne his passion of dolour, but he seamed more ready to passe that waye then desyrous to enioy longer life, albeit beyng kepte from doynge force agaynst himselfe, by certaine hys seruauntes that were there, he vttered som¦part of hys inwaerde gref by open exclamation agaynste hys owne misfortune, inveighynge chyeflye agaynste the inor∣din at will of hys daughter, with aduise to all fathers to kepe a steddye eye vppon their slypprye y outhe, wherein he co∣mended vnto theym the example of hys owne follye in fauo∣ryng so much the fonde appetit of hys daughter that he gaue leaue to her Libertye to excede the viewe or pursewte of his eye, accusynge chieflie the impedyment he gaue to the ma∣riage, seynge that in the same appeared the perentory ruine of hys house, continuall desolation to hys old yeres, and in the ende to leaue hys goodes and lyuynge to straungers for want of an heire of his bodye, for that hauynge but ij. chil∣dren the one was already dead, and the other no lesse worthe
by ye mortal violence he had vsed vpon the innocencie of the mayd, who (after ye surgeants had somwhat stayed ye bledyng of her woundes) confessed the contract and circūstance of the loue whereof you haue harde a particular declaracion, whi∣che rather encreased the dule of tholde man, then gaue mo∣deration to his sorowe, whyche notwithstandynge by the perswacions of hys neighbours, and constraint of necessity (whych as) a vertue giueth pacience perforce to all extreme∣ties he dysmissed in outeward showe and disposed hymself to the funerall obsequies in as solēne manner as he cold, erec∣tynge a tombe of marble in Sainct francys churche, wherin were shryned the bodies of the ij louers as dead at one time, and by one occasion, to the great regreat of the whole towne wherein euerye one was so indifferentlye passioned wyth sorowe that a man should hardly haue hard any other tunes then publike exclamacion against the cruelty of CLAVDIO by whyche generall complaint, together with the depositiōs of the mayde (who dyed within three dayes after her hurtes) DOM RAMYRO CATALANO gouernor of CESENNA vnder CESAR BORGIA, began to enter into tearmes of compas∣sion on the behalfe of the ij. dead louers, and mortall anger against CLAVDIO, for that his cruelty only was the cause of the death of the ij. only flowers & peragōs in Italy, wherin he purseued so vehemently ye rigour of his office, & equity of iustice yt CLAVDYO lost his head secretly within the castel for feare of mutine or tumulte of his frendes. This was ye miserable end of ye loue & lif of ye ij. SISENNOIS wose death and discorse of amarous traffique, for yt it doth not exced the remēbrāce of our time, I haue preseted as a familiar exāple affore ye eyes of our youth, to thend yt euery one respecting ye duty of his own indeuor, may vse ye misery of this precedēt as a paterne to preuēt ye like myschief in thē selues, wherin also as we may note that loue is but a rage or humor of frātike follye deriued of our selues, & conuerted to our owne harme by thindiscrecion that is in vs, so ye next remedy to withstand that furye is to encounter him vnder thenseigne of raison, &
slee the occasions, whyche weaken the mynde wythout tra∣uell and bringe the bodye in the ende to the theatrye of exe∣cution, wee are also warned here to temper the delites wee possesse with suche measure, that forget∣tynge the blyndenes of LIVIO, we maye eschewe the horrour of hys acte with detestation of the folys he vsed in the glott of his vnlaw∣full plea∣sure. FINIS.
The argument, ACcording to thoppinion of the wise Demosthenes there is no one vertue that hath made more famous the fa∣thers of formèr time, thenne the gyft of cyuill curtesy, neyther is na∣ture more glorifyed in the ympes of her creation, then in that we dis∣pose our selues & doings according to the dispocition of the clymat whiche shee hath appoin∣ted to gouerne our accions and thoughtes, respecting chief¦ly to refraine from violacion of innocent blodde, which in al ages hath restored a name of great clemencie to diuerse Albeit (touching other effectes) they were ambycius tyran∣tes, and cruell enemyes to their owne common wealthe, whiche, vnnatural crueltie also as it hath bene & is of such detestacion amongest ye rudest companions of the world, that the verye barbarians haue alwaies had in horrour the wickednes of suche as pursewed the queste of guiltles blodde, and toke awaye the life of him that had not com∣mitted offence, So they haue alwaies had in honour the vertue of suche as soughte to extirppe the roote of ty∣ranical furies borne for the ruine and destruction of man like as among the romaine emprours Nero Calygulus and Commodus, amongest ye straung nacions, Phalaris Alexan¦der Phereus Dyomedes & the cursed Numylysyntha Quene of Thracia, who after she had miserably murdered an ynno¦cent mother, committed semblable crueltie vpō the childe within her bellye, wherof albeit the horrour was greate yet was it nothinge in respect of the hellishe acte of a la∣dy of oure tyme happyninge not in the Antropophogans
Scythya or amongeste Canybales or Amazones aunciente morderers of their children, but in the harte and mid∣dest of Evrope, and in one of the most faire and riche pro∣uinces of the world, where afore time hath bene kepte all Academia or generall scoole to instructe all naci∣ons for the honeste and vertuous direction of their liues, but of late was founde there a gentlewoman (degenera∣tinge frome thinstincte of her secte) which exposed effectes of more cruel∣tye, thenne earst hath bene noted by any writers of a any age, whereof the discourse folo∣wethe at large.
A YONG LADY IN MY∣Lan after she had longe abused the vertue of her youthe and honour of maryage with an vnlavvfull haunte of diuers yonge gentlemen becoms an vnnaturall morderer of the frute of her wombe for that shée was forsaken of hym who gatt her wyth Chylde HAuinge then to treate vpon tragicall af¦fayres procedynge of vnnaturall luste, with LASYVIVS disposition, the onlye maister pocke and cheif fountayne from whence distylleth all poysned humors of Infection, ouerflowinge at lengthe the channel of his quiett cours with vnrewe¦lye waues of Inordynat crewelty: I meane here to presente vnto you the trewe pattorne of a seconde MEDEA, in the person of a yonge Ladye borne and wantonlye bredd vp in the ryche and populus Cytie of MYLLEYNE, whom bycause myne author seames to Christen by a contrary tytell, to a∣boyde all occasions of myslykes whiche other Ladyes (bea∣ringe the lyke name) myght vniustly fall into by the lauishe mouthes of the malycyous sorte, I think it good also to passe vnder fearmes of lyke scylence her parentes and husbande, to thende that their vertue (meryting a better mede then to beare the blame of the detestable lyfe of there wycked daugh¦ter) come not also in question amongest such DIABOLOS as haue there tounges alwayes typped with the mettall of ma∣lycyous slaunder. This PANDORA then (borowinge her name of the qualytye of her vnchaste and crewell conuersa∣cyon) gaue manyfest signes during the tyme of her Infansye of her future disposition, arguinge the poysined Clymatte
whiche firste gettynge domynion ouer the yonge yeares of her grene vnderstāding dyrected after ye whole seaquel of her life by the dyal of a cursed constellacion, makinge the latter remaynder of her yeres subiecte to a thousande ylls and per Badde argu∣mēt in a yong vvoman. rentory Inconueniences, for she was disdaynfull without respect, spytefull without measure, honge altogether full of the fethers of folyshe pryde, so whollye gyuen to wallowe in dilycarie that she detected al exercises of vertue, and so drow¦ned in the fylthye desyre of the fleshe, that afore shee had at∣tayned to the full of fortene yeres, she became such a banque roupte of her honour that a poore page the sonne of a simple artyficer noryshed in the house of her father for charitie sake onlye, exept so farr into her creditt, that with small sute hee gayned the vse of the Ile which ought to bee Inuincyble in vnhonest sorte, wherin notwithstandinge after hee hadde once rampyred himselfe, fyndinge the soyle in lesse fertyle, then to be tylled with easye trauell, hee founde also no lesse famylyarytie in the owner, who feasted him so frankly with the pleasaunte Ieweste and precious commoditie of her I∣lande, not earst inhabyted by Straungers, that his common exercise was to kepe her companie euery night alone in her chamber, leaste the LEVTYNS and daungerous bogbeares appearinge by visions in the night shoulde put her in feare or kepe her from sleape. This was one chiefe delyght wher∣in she toke pleasure in the prime time of her age, an vndoub∣ted kalender suer of the noble actes to be expected in this ym∣pe as her yeres grewe to greater nomber, and her desier of more maturytye, which wicked exercise is sufficyent of it selfe to vntye the tunges of bacbyters, styrringe vp the ma∣lyce of certeine POLOLVGOS redye alwayes vpon one sim∣ple occasion; or; for the falte of one, to reprehende the honour of all dames: if the vertue of (you chast) Ladyes weare not only hable to confute all their suborned reasons of reproche, but also by the cleare Integrety of your conuersacion, to charme the mouth of the slaunderer from Inueyghing by
synister meanes agaynste anye of the noble secte femenyne so muche commendable and to bee honored of all men. This yonge pupill and prentyse of VENVS, although shee lystned with small traynynge to the lewre of CVPIDO, yet vsed shée notwithstandinge such care in the conueyghe of her folyes, that the best eyes in her fathers house, weare to blynd to be∣holde the amorous traffique which passed betwene the page and her, neyther was she doughted (wheresoeuer shee came) to be preferred to the firste place in the bedroll of pewer vir∣gins, although (as you haue hard) she had payd the fyrste fru∣tes of her virgynytie to one no lesse vnworthy of thoffering then to enioye the possession of so deare a Iewell, beinge al∣ready vowed to an other by thē yt by most ryght ought to dis∣pose of it: And who maye sée here as in a glasse their greate Her parentes neglygence and lyttle care in theducation of their children, preferrynge rather to pamper theim in pleasure, wyth to large a skope in lybertye, (the chiefeste meane to seduce yonglyngs not yet confyrmed in rypenes of discression) then to restrayne thappetyte of ther foolyshe will, whiche doth not onely make theim bodyes subiecte to all sensuall prostytucy∣on, but also subuertes the honor of their whole house wher∣of they toke there begynninge. This ITALIAN Impe. and honest PANDORA, wearye euen nowe of the companye of her page who belyke was not hable to quenche the luste of his vnsaciable mystresse, began with famylyer glaunces of her eye, and other secret regardes of good wyll, to practyse a seconde league of societie, concludinge a newe bargayne of loue wyth a yonge gentylman lustye and likelye euerye waye to performe thexpectacion of her desyre, who also for his first endeuor, found ye meanes to corrupt her gouernese wt certeyne peces of golde, armes (suer) sufficient enoughe of Money is ha∣ble to batter the strongest fortresse vn∣der heauen themselues to batter the walls of the strongest and beste de∣fended fortresse that this daye is vnder the pole of heauen, which also was the kaye (as the Poetes fayne) that opned IV∣PITER the dore of the brazen tower wherin ye fayre DANAE daughter of ACRISES was curyously enclosed. This second
louer thinking to cooll the firste flower of the maydenhed of PANDORA (beinge yet scars xvi. yeres of age) began to doubte of the case, when hee founde the waye alreadye bea∣ten and the entrye so easye without resistance, albeit conten∣tinge himsefle with his present fortune, beinge dryuen not∣withstandinge to drinke the lées of the vessel which the page had gaged to his hande, and sucked out the sugred Iewse of f that grape, he fayled not to courte her with a contynuall aunte of his companye, in suche sorte, that his chiefe exer∣ise and tyme was employed in the supplye of her gredy de∣yre, vntyll at last being cloyed for wante of chaunge of dy∣tte, or wearye with so longe huntinge one kynde of chase, r peraduenture not hable any longer to mainteyne the skir∣ysh for want of fresh supplyes, he began to suborne diuers eanes to purchase his departure, wherin with thassystance f a fewe fayned importunytyes, hee preuayled only with his exense: that being captayne of certeyn bands of footmen, t behoued him (he sayde) for greate respectes, to visitte his charge with expedicion, wherwith, with small sute hée gatte leaue and wente his waye, resigning the forte whiche hee had so long battered, to the guard of an olde and rich gentyl∣man, dwellinge in the same Cytie, who doatinge more vpon the bewtie of PANDORA, thenne notinge deligentlye her disposytion, maryed her, after longe intercession to her fren∣des.

But this pleasure being of slipper continuance, stale awaye with the shortnes of time, their great amitie conuerted into indigna∣cion and spitfull reuenge, yea their mutuall societic sealed with all assuraunce of affection in their harts, was by & by so separated & vtterlye dissolued, that it was neuer hable to re∣turne to his former vnitye, for sone after the league of this new frendship, behold the Page sumwhat refreshed by the absence of two or thrée monethes from his mistres, repaires to his old exercise, wherein he found no worse intertainemēt at the bonntiful hand of PANDORA, then when he fyrst tyl∣led the soyle of so fertil an Ile, neyther would she for all this lose the company of her new champyon Parthonope, but vsing the order of leuel coyle she feasted them both indiferentlye of the dishes of one kynd of banquet, and reserued to her selfe a chaunge of dyet at her pleasure.

Pandora. The firste viewe of this letter was of harde, disgestion to PARTHONOPE, who albeit the feare which he hadde, that PANDORA wold mordure (as she did in dede) the frute con∣gelēd of the substaunce of theim bothe in her intralles, presented a certeine remorse afore the eyes of his consci∣ence, yet, because she would neuer afore let him vnderstande that she was with childe, hee thoughte it was but a newe meane to allure him eftesones to the trafficque of her affai∣res, whervpon vsing as litle regarde to the contentes of the letter, as he made smal accompte of her that write it, dispat∣ched the messenger with this shorte aunswere. Thou shalte (sayeth he) declare to thy mistrys that if she hadde heretofore ymparted to me theffect of thy presente message she should
haue disposed of mée and my frendeshippe at her pleasure, but nowe seinge shée, traues my assistaunce by necessitie, I committe her to the méede of her owne follie. whereof PANDORA beinge aduertised by the heauie reapport of her FYNEA, who also alledged dispaire eftsones to recouer the frendshippe or companie of the knighte, entred furth∣wyth into suche dispocition of malencollie wyth ymagy∣nacions of reuenge, that conuertinge thappetite of her aun∣ciente loue into an humor of deadlie hate, doubted whe∣ther shee shoulde vse force againste her selfe, for the spite of the villainy he had don to her, or persecute hym vnto dea∣the whose life shee vtterly detested, and waueringe thus in contrarietie of opinions, she soughte to appease somwhat the furye of her presente dolloure, by recordynge her greete with these lamentable tearmes. Alas (saithe shée) if this bée the rewarde of true loyal∣tie, what assuraunce maye wee reappose in constancie? Pandora ex∣claimeth. or what meede to be exspected in the vertie of suche vnfai∣ned frendshippe, as I professed to this vnthankeful and per∣iured knighte, haue I refused the seruice of so many gentle∣menne, offringe franklie to employe their times vnder the becke of my commaundemente, to make my affection sub∣iecte to one, who hauinge alreadie called oute of me the frutes of his desyer, smiles nowe at my simplicitie, and laughes to sée mée languishe in dule? Ah why were the eyes of my mynde so dymmed with the myste of fonde zeale, that I colde not consider the common malice of menne now a dayes, who preferring their humble seruice wyth all kinde of othes, dienge a thousande times a daye for oure sakes, yea offringe their lyues to all kynde of perill, doo seame to remeine prisonners in the ward of oure good will, vn∣till their fayned ymportunyties, preuailyuge aboue the weake resistance of vs poore wretches do place theime in the possession of their desyer, and beinge once made Lordes ouer that, whyche onely colde commaunde theym afore,

And thou FYNEA sholest haue me to forgett him, in whose loue I doate, although I wishe nothing so muche as his vtter des∣truction: And now do I see the doe rewarde of my former vnchaste conuersacion, for the seruente affection whiche I beare him, doth now yelde me doble vsure of the want on libertie wherin I haue lyued hetherunto, neyther shall I be enioyned to other penance for my falte, then a loathesome

As we reade of the magicians in Egypte, before Pharao, thenchaunteresse stirrynge vp the sprit of S∣muell God suffred the magicions of Egypte to vvorke vvon∣ders in the sight of Pha∣rao. muell in the presence of Saule kinge of the Hebrues, and Simon the coiurer honored as a God of the folishe prince and people of Rome, to thende the faythfull flocke (strengthened and confirmed, by the grace of the holye sprite) maye glorye in theyr assured belyef in the true God, by the peremptorye fal of those infedels, together wyth all suche as vnhappelye lysten to theyr pernicious doctrine. Here PANDORA seynge all her deuises (accompanyed with a crooked fortune) retourne a successe contrary to her meanynge, began to enter into a newe passion of suche rage and dispaire, that she had euen nowe dismissed the re∣sidue of her dayes by the fatall dome of her owne handes, yf she had not bene eftsones interupted by FINEA, who for thappeasinge of her present dule, preferred vnto her the ayde of a graye frier, a greate ghostly father in that Cytie, whom she affirmed to haue wroughte meruelous effectes by the healpe of certeine distilled waters tempered wyth the iewice of stronge hearbes, growynge secretlye within the intrailles of the earthe, the nature of hidden stoanes and mettals, pouders and séedas not knowen to manye, wyth diuerse other suffumigacions incident to witchecrafte, and who in déede was noted to haue bestowed more of hys tyme The studye of scripture ought to bee thexercise of the religions in the studie of that darke art, and philosophie of Sathan, then in tourninge ouer the sacred volumes of holye scripture and testament of the Lorde, whiche oughte to bée the only exer∣cise of those that are clad in the habite of religion.
Beholde here an example of greate vertue in oure Ab∣baye men, who beinge appareilled in a simple habite, in signe of humilitye, doe carie the deuill in the cowle of theyr hoodes. And who (accordynge to saint Augustin) beinge the chiefe pillors that susteine supersticion, are also the grea∣test frendes to ydolatrie, dimynge the puritie of religion Abbaies the chiefest pil∣lors that men teine super∣stion and ydolatrye.

Howe shoulde the ignoraunt bée guided in the righte waye to saluacion, if they whiche oughte to open the lyght of the gospell, do giue manifest examples of errours? or how can the glorye of God bée renoumed amongest men? Yf they whiche standynge in the pulpit of truth, and ought sincere∣lye to preache the lawe of the Lorde, do conuerte theyr dutie towardes the true Religion into practises of Nygromancie and tearmes of inuocation of deuils, vnprofitable mem∣dres certeinlye, deseruinge rather to bée vtterlye weded out of the common welth, then (norrished in the idle trade of an abbaye lownde) to be suffred (vnder the vaile of God∣lynes and deuocion (to practise haynous conspiracies a∣gainste God and man?

To this holye father then commes Pandora with a countenaunce all cladd wyth sorowe, declarynge the circumstaunce of her loue passed, the cause of her pre∣sent passion, with the whole discourse of her former lyfe hi∣therunto, crauynge (wyth greate intercession in the ende) thassistance of his arte, for moderation in the martiredome which she endured; by the feruent affection she bare to the knighte. The freare (notwitstanding his vowe and straite othe of his Freares bee couetous. order) had not his conscience so armed wyth the vertue of

Oh crueltye more then barbarous? Is it pos∣sible that a Gentelwoman of so tender yeres, deriued of honest parentage, norrished in ciuilitie, and that whyche more is, a Christian, borne in the harte of EVROPE, shold so muche forget the feare of God and regarde to his lawes, as in augmentynge the haynous faulte of the wronge al∣redye don againste her husbande, by so many and vnchaste adulteries, to committ in the ende an execrable effusion of the blood deriued of the droppes of her owne substance? Oh howe cursed and vnhappye is the condicion of them, that declinynge (for wante of grace) from the pathe of rea∣son, do suffer theim selues to bée ledd by the lyne of fleshe∣lye appetyt, the chiefest meane that makes vs forgett God and all good order. For this PANDORA desyrous to couer her faulte, albeit not hable to hide her bigge bellye, Suggestion of the fleshe makes vs so∣nest forget God. assayed to destroye the creature (mouynge within her) by crushynge her sydes wyth greate force, drynkynge caw∣dels made for the nonst, and swallowinge diuerse other

Albeit seynge her exspected successe of this beastelye pollecye, was also denied her, she deuised a laste meane for the accomplish∣ment of her enterprise, whiche the veraye ennemy of na∣ture (I am sewer) woulde abhorre to ymagine, which was, that seyng she coulde not be delyuered by the assistaunce of sorceries, purgacions, nor other pollecie, whyche the arte of enchauntynge was hable to lende her, she resolued (as a bloddie boocher of her owne bloud) to breake the bed of thin∣ant A deuelish of deuise of Pandora. within her entrails and driue it out of her wombe by veray force, wherein she was assisted by FINEA, who ac∣accordynge to the commaundement of her mystresse, carri∣ynge a syluer basyn into the highest torret in the house, wente thether immediatlye bothe together, where after the doares were shott on all sides, Pandora with a troubled countenaunce all pantinge, for the horrour of the acte which she ment to execute, beholdynge her bellye with serpentine eyes sparklynge with flames of furie, sayed vnto her mayde, like as alas thou knowest FINEA, howe extremelye I am delte withall at the handes of the thrisewretched Parthonope, who without anye respect to the paine which I endure) hath vtterlye disclaimed mine acquaintance, wyth lesse regarde to preserue the séedes whyche he hathe grafted and lefte growinge within me, euen so thou arte not ignoraunt of thindeuour I haue vsed to reclaime hym, and rampyer my selfe eftsones in his fauor, wherof the one is no lesse vn∣likelye, then the other daungerous: and beynge spyted of fortune, heauen and carthe seame also to bende the force of theyr malice againste mine attemptes. Albeit I coulde somwhat moderate the extremetie of my passion, yf the viewe of my greate bellye, dyd not renewe the rage of my feuer, wherein I dye a thousande tymes, hauynge anye thyng afore mine eyes that eyther representeth his lieknes, or moueth anye cause of remembraunce of that detestable
wretche, who (as I hope) shall neuer take pleasure in any child of his engendred in the bodye of Pandora: and as I haue assayed diuers wayes (as thou knowest) to discharge me of this burden, wherin I haue nothynge preuayled because my destenie contends against my endeuor. Euenso beynge not hable any longer to conceile my falte nor couer my wōbe swelled with the wycked sede of his generacion, and seynge withall, my husband is now vpon the point of his returne, I am determined to commit my life to extreme perill, to thend to dispatche me of this burden, which I hate asmuch as other women take pleasure to beare, and bryng forth with so great contētement. And if I could as largelye cōmande ouer him, as I haue power to worke the spyte of his wrong vpon the pawne he hath lefte within me, I assure thée, these handes should make no lesse straunge Anotomy of his carcas, then I meane forthwith in thy presence to dismember the monster which by his act I fele stirre in the Inner parts of my raines, wherewith FINEA hearing this deuelish resolucion, prefer∣red persuasions to the contrarie, alledgynge that the horror weare to great; that a mother shoulde become the tyrannous murdresse of her selfe & childe at one instant, and (saith she) touchinge your being with child, there be meanes inough to kepe it secret without vsing any crueltye, in killyng thinno∣cent creature, which ought not to beare the penaunce of the faulte of the father, tush, tush, saith this she wolfe and merci∣les MEDEA, that euil is but light where counsel takes place, The euill is but light vvhere coun∣cell takes place. do awaye these persuasions and dispose thy selfe to assiste me, for otherwise thou shalt sée me dye in thy presence, and then thy preachynge shalbe in vayne to her that is absolutly resolued to pursue the ende of her meanynge, what is it then that I shall doe, saith FINEA, to whom (as a cruell ME∣GERA cōming out of the hollow and darke places of thinfer∣nal valleys, she enioyned her this fyrst charge, get thee vpp, saith she, vpon that high coffer there, and I wil spred my bel∣lye alonge vpon the grounde with my backe vpwarde. And so wyth all thy force thou shalte leape vpon my Keynes,
which I hope wil be a meane to open an Issue for this cursed burden whiche is so greuous for me to carye, wherin if thou vse thutermost of thy force, thou shalte restore me to spedye contentement. But if thou spare to employe thy whole strength, thow shalte prolonge my payne, driuynge me to make myne owne handes the ministers of my meanynge FINEA not likyng greatly the charge of suche commission, and muche lesse the execucion in so horrible a maner, al∣thoughe the terrour of the fact troubled her for a tyme: Yet beynge of longe tyme acquainted wyth the condicions and crueltye of her mystres, mounts vpon the highe chest, lea∣pinge seauen or eyghte tymes together vpon the backe of Pandora, wyth suche impetuositie that anye man woulde haue thought that so manye blowes wyth the heuye swaigh of all her bodye, had bene hable to haue broken the bones of her backe, and dispatched the mother and childe toge∣ther. But all these trafficques beynge in vayne, prolon∣ged but the payne of Pandora, who doublyng her rage wyth this repulse of her enterprise, entred into deuises of more mischiefe and tyrannie not almost to be talked of, what hart alas is so endurated wyth the mettall of hardnes, but the horror of this hellyshe crueltye, wyll moue it to destil drops of bloud? what countenaunce so assured that cane wyth∣hold hys teares, or not shrinck at the tyranous disposition of this lyonesse? or what heares wyll not stande vp at the tra∣gicall discours of this strange kynde of chylde bearynge. Truelye I knowe that vertuous Ladyes (sprinkled wyth the dewe of pytie,) wyll not onelye tremble at the remem∣braunce of the inordinate crueltye of this cursed mother, but also open the conduits of their cōpassions, weping on ye behalfe of the torment wherin vnnaturally she plunged the innocent impe which nature had formed of the substance of her selfe, who conuerted from the shape of a woman into the disposition of a deuel, raginge without measure, that she could not be deliuered, howled out at laste with a horrible

Oh cursed and execrable creature, wher with possessed wholye with the spirit of furie, hauing her eyes sonke into her head, her stomacke panting, and her face all full of black bloud, by the vehemencie of the conflicte which she had indured, began to leape withal her force from the tope of the coffer down to the ground, brosing her sides with her handes, and playinge on the drum with her fystes vpon her great bellye, with such huge blowes, that felyng euen now the lytel creature with∣in her remoued from his place, redye to drope oute of her wombe, called for the socors of FINEA, who standynge in place of a midwyfe.

Oh horrible & execrable condicion of an Italian, who being fosterd in the myrie vale of camonycka amongst the wyches and cursed enchaunterers, socked there the vice of her nurce wyth the mylke of her pappe. Albeit I coulde make cōparison of the like crueltie executed in the greatest Cytie of Fraunce by a gentilwoman of that contrye, who Paris. beinge newly deliuered of the burden of her bellye, made a beastlye sacrifice of it in the fyre, and that wyth the consent and in the presence of the detestable pallyard that begat it, Whorema▪ mster. deseruynge both to be inuested with the tytell of cursed pa∣rents and blodye bochers of the sedes congealed of theyr owne substaunce, sauynge that the ende of this infortunat Infant was more tragicall, and the doings of his mother
more detestable, who excedinge the brutuall crueltye of the wolfe, tygrese, or Lyonesse rauenynge amongest the flocke of lyttel lambes in the fatt and fertyll feldes of LIBIA, se∣inge her thus discharged of her burden, began also to dys∣mysse the greatnes of her dolor, and beholdinge wyth her eyes, (shyninge lyke ye blase of two torches wyth the flame of furye) the new borne creature sprawling in the basyn, be∣gan to whett her tethe, shakinge her heade with horrible re∣gards prognosticatinge the laste acte of the rage whiche shee haddes yet to playe, saying vnto FYNEA, doste thou not sée howe this lyttel beast resembles alreadye the Image of his pariured father, beholde I praye the his countenaunce, and marke ye sondry liklehods that euen now appeare in his face, arguing vndoubtedly that (if lyfe woulde geue leaue to his Inclynacion) his detestable disposicion woulde be nothinge Inferyor to yt vil lanie of him whose trayterous dysloyaltye hath made me (as thou féest) ye cursed mynister of inordynat crewelty, And If I had ye lyke power ouer him yt is ye cause of this vnnatural passion, I would assuredlye enioyne him such penaunce, that his, iuste chastysmente shoulde import a ter∣ror to all traytors that hereafter shoulde seke to seduce anye Ladye by sugred words, wherewith bendinge her lokes to∣wardes the lyttell Impe (hastinge to his ende by the seconde conflycte hee hadde endewred by hys mother and her mayde, afore his eyes weare vnsealed to sée the light of this worlde,) she wished eftsones the presens of PARTHONOPE vpon whome (sayth shee) syth I am vnhappelye denyed to wreake my vengaunce in suche sorte as I woulde, at leasts I will content my selfe for the tyme, to see the ponyshed in the place of him, whose pycture thow rightlye presentes, as a trewe patorne shaped of the masse of his substance, and se∣inge thy destenye is to incurre the penaunce due to thy fa∣ther, the payne of thy erecucion shalbe nothinge inferyor to the meryt of his execrable falt, wherin sayth shée, arme your selues, (Oh my handes) with corage, and shrinke not to bee the mynisters of the ponishiment which my tongue hath pro
nounced, reioyce Oh my harte in the ffusion of his blodd, whose de the brings repose to the long passion of thy dolors, and you mine eyes laughe your full to se the dismembringe of him, whome I meane to offer as a sacrafyse of vengaunce on the behalfe of PARTHONOPE, whose remembraunce (with the blodde of his son) I will presentlye rote out of my minde for euer. Certenlye good Ladyes my harte abhorring no lesse the remembraunce of this bychfore, then my spirite trobled with tremblinge feare at the contynaunce of her cre∣weltye, giues such impediment to my penne, that it is scarce hable to discribe vnto you, the laste act of her rage, wherein this lymme of thinfernal lake, not worthye any lōger to bea∣re the name of a woman, procedinge to thende of her enter∣prise, takes vp her sonne with her bloodye and murderinge handes, whom without all compassion, and contrary to the order of a christian, she beates with all her force againste the walles, painting the postes and pauements in the chamber with the bloddde and braynes of the innocent creature newe borne, wherwith not yet contented nor satisfyed in her rage, she takes in eyther of her handes one of the tender legges of the child now deade, and deuiding them as the bocher ioynts his lambe or yonge goate which he layes vpon his staulle to be sould, fell of a sodayn laughter in signe of the great plea∣sure she toke in this execution, wishing notwithstanding to enter into the same exercise with him of whom this defor∣med carrion (as she tearmed this dismembred Infant) toke his first beginninge. Here if I shoulde preferre the perticu∣ler discours of the exploits of this second MEDEA and erecra¦ble monster of our time, I could not escape (I am sure) wtout the secret grudges of some, who hauinge made large sale of their honor at to lo we a price, & getting in like sort ye byt of frantike Ialoye betwen their teth, do stodye nothing but the art of reueng, albeit because ye vertue of honest & chastladies shal sine the clearer, by the darke eclipse of such cómon ene∣myes of the whole sect Femenyne, I wil yet treat of the tyrany of this PANDORA who reserued thextreame pointe of her
Iewishe creweltie vntil the last act of her tragedye, for mar∣teringe the dead childe, and treadinge it vnder her fete, shée thrust her hande vnder his shorte rybbes, and taking out his hart, gnawed it (as a bych of HERCANIA) betwene her teth into littell morsels, saying that shee hoped one daye to pro∣uyde the like banquyt for PARTHONOPE, whiche shoulde confirme the quyet she felt in the present death and detesta∣ble execucion of his Image and likenes, and hauing her had yet dyed with the blodd of this guiltles impe of nature, shée told not be ryd of the importunat deuil that possessed her, vn∣til she had brought ye ryuer of her rage vnto thextreme brink of tyrannye, neyther could her harte be brought to appease∣ment so longe as her eyes fed vpon the viewe of the deade in∣fant: Wherfore callinge in a great mastyphe cur, she gaue him (by pecemeale) the members of her childe, an act suer of no lesse detestacion afore the hygh throne of God, then to be abhorred of all the world. Ah las, haue thytalyan mothers no other ombes for their childrē, thē to bury them in ye belly of a dogge? be these the teares wherewith they accompanye them into the shrouding shete? Is this the curtesy of Italye? or a creweltie deriued of the barbarous nacion? but how cold she expose other frewtes outwardly, then according to the na∣ture of the spirite which possessed her within, for the deuill beinge seased of her hart, made her body and other members the mynisters of her wil, which God doth oftentymes suffer as wel for the due correction of heynous faults, as also for an example, and terror to all offenders in the like affayres. I am lothe good Ladyes to passe any further in the pursute of this dolorous tragedye, because your eyes (alredy wearyed with wepinge,) methinke I see also your eares offer to close themselues against ye report of this PANDORA, whose only offence had bene enough to staine your whole secte with per petual iamie, if ye pure chastitie of so many of you offred not to confute the slaunder by your vertue only, neither cā ye im∣pudente and wicked liffe of suche double curtalls as (shee was) impayre thestimacion of them, that wyth thintente of pure integritie, do rather giue suck to their honor wt ye milke
of simplicytie: then being Italyonated with all subteltyes, trustinge onlye in the humor of their owne braine, do fall at laste into the common slaunder of all the worlde: for a fa∣mylyar profe wherof I leaue you to skanne the order and do¦inges of this PANDORA, who waringe nowe somewhat colde in her former passions of frensye and rage, began to be pinched with the panges Incydente comenlye to all wo∣men, in the paynfull trauell of childe bearinge, wherfor go∣inge to bed she caused certeyn baynes to be prouided, wher∣in washinge her selfe, the next daye beinge hallowed and a feaste of great solempnytye, she was caryed in a rych coche to vysitt the companie of other Ladyes, amongeste whome she was not worthye to kepe place, being the shamefull bo∣ther of her own blood, and wicked ennemy to the life of mā. Herein is to be noted the destructiun of a woman banished the pallays of reason together with the due mede of their merytt, who for the respect of a lyttell pleasure, (of no more contynuance then a moment) do put their honour vpon tear¦mes of Infamye, and there soules in hazard of euerlastinge tormente, here the adulterers maye see howe iustelye God ponysheth their infydelytie & breach of othes towardes their husbands, let also the yong ladyes and lyttel girls learne to direct the cours of their youth by ye contrary of this example. and beinge once registred in the boke of maryage, let theim stād vpō their guard, for falling into ye like folies, for ther is nothīg cōmitted in secret, but in ye end it bursts out to a cōmō brute, which our sauior Christ affyrmeth by the mouthe of ye prophet sainge, yt what so euer is done in the darkest corner of the house, shalbe published in ye end in open audience, And he who sekes most to conceile his faulte, is not onlye (by the permission of God) the first opner of the same, but also beares the badge of shame afore the face of ye world, and standes in daunger of grace in the presence of him from whom no se∣cret canne bee hydde.

one glad to sée so happy a successe lyke to folowe his busines, the other no lesse ioyfull to haue so fytt a meane to mani∣fest his frendshipp to wardes his frende; departed with sem∣blable contentemēt, the one to his lodging with a thousand hammors in his heade till he sawe the effect of his dryfte, the other with no lesse griefe of minde till he had performed the exspectation of his charge, wherein he began immediatlye to practise wyth hys syster, whome he founde of a contrary opinion, excusyng her selfe wyth the care she had of her doug∣hter, whome she sayed she would neyther leaue alone, nor cōmit her selfe to the order and gouernemēt of straungers, at whose handes there is as great doubte of good entratye, as small helpe or hope of amendement beinge once made their vassalt and subiect by lawe of mariage, besides (syr) saith she not without some teares, it is not yet a yere synce I lost hym, whom if I loued by awe beinge on lyue, I oughte with no lesse duety to honor after his death, neyther colde I auoyde the iuste murmure and ordinary suspicion of the peo∣pls, y I should seame more hastye to yelde my affection to other, then readye to performe my duetye & ceremonies of dule to him that is dead, and that with in the yere afore the funerall be fully ended, the widowes lyfe is also pure of it selfe, bounde to no care nor controlement of any, and so ac∣ceptable before God, that thapostle doubteth not to accompte her amonge the number of the religious, yf after she haue once tasted of mariage and restored agayne to her ly∣bertie, she content her selfe wyth the fyrste clogge or burden of bondage, lyuinge after in ymitacion of true vertue, be∣sides the holy man Sainct Augustin diswadeth all wydowes eftesones to marie, aduising theim to mortifie suche mociōs as the fleshe is apte to sturre vppe and norrishe, by con∣templacion and prayer, and true sinceritie of lyfe, saynge further that they are accompted afore God amongest the nomber of chaste and pure virgins. And because it may bee paraduenture thoppinion of some, that the burden of wido∣wed
is greuous & almost intollerable vnto me, presuming the same rather by the gréenes of my youth (not yet cofirmed in rypenes of yeres and discretion) then vpon any good or assured grounde to iustifye theyr opinion, I assure you, I féele my selfe so plentifully assisted with the spirite of grace, that I doubte no more to withstande all temptations & vaine assaults which the wicked instigations of the flesh may here∣after minister vnto me, then heretofore in tender yeres whē nature denied anye such mocion to stur in me, I lyued frée & voyde of suck prouocatiō. And for end good brother, my hart, deuining diuersly of the successe of this mariage, threatneth a further mischiefe to fall vpon me, and to late a repentance for you that is the vnfortunat causer of the same. Here her brother knowing it a fault in all women to here them selues well spoken of and yet a chiefe meane to wynne theim to fede their humour with flatterings praies begā to ioine with her in commendacion of her honestie, affirmynge her chaste conuersation to bee no lesse meritorious since she was wy∣dowe, then her pure virginitie generally allowed, and pray∣sed of all men afore she was maried, which is the chiefest cause said he that the Captayne desiereth in honeste sorte to pos∣sess you, but touching any sinister successe that might follow this sacred league of lawfull matrimonye as she seamed to predestinate within her selfe, he ministred persuacions to to the contrary, alledginge the same to be a superstitious follye attributed to the auncientes of olde tyme, to calculat their good or ill successe by the tunes or charme of byrdes, or somtime by the sodaine encoūter of beastes or suche men as they loked not for, arguing ye same to bée such absolut signes of il lucke yt cōmonly they wolde refraine frō theyr affayres as ye day, & touching ye murmur & suspiciō of the people whose tongs although they be naturally tipte wt the metal of slaū∣der yet ought you as litell saith he feare their malice, as care for their grudge, consideringe your acte is no lesse acceptable afore God, then tollerable by the positiue lawes of man, neither can they but iudge well of your doinges & like better
of your choyce seinge you are woede with great importuny∣ties, and wone by one that is of your owne qualitie and no∣thinge inferior to you in vertue or noblenes of race, but if you sticke of any ceremonies which you haue yet to perform to him that is deade, youre errour is greater thenne you maye Iustefye, and your wisedome lesse then is necessarye in suche a case, neyther is the voice of the multitude in that respecte of suche contynaunce, but tyme can take it awaye and a wonder lasteth not for euer, and for my parte I hope you wil conferre my presente meaninge in this mat∣ter, with the longe experienced faythe and affection whiche heretofore you haue noted in me, besides I colde not auoyde thimputacion of a monster and enemy to nature, If I shold not bée as carefull of your quiet as of my own life, praying you for ende and as my laste request to reapose your selfe whollie vppon my faythe, and frendshippe and fidelytye of him, who honoreth you with no lesse then his lyfe and al that he hath, wherwith he so muche preuailed ouer his obedyent syster, that she being vnhappely ouercom with his vehemēt importunyties condissended very willingly to his vnfortu∣nat request, which after became the perentory destruction of the pore wydow, leauing to late & myserable a repentance to her brother: albeit afore I procede to the ceremonies of her vnfortunat mariage, I thoughte good to tel vnto you in this place thoppynion of mine author touchinge the dyuynacion of the spirite of man, who (saythe hee) albeit by a secret in∣stincke and vertue of the mynde, is hable some tymes to pre∣sage that will fall, and the soule (beinge deuine of it selfe) dothe also prognosticate dyuersly of the future chaunces and Touchinge dyuynacion of the mynd. chaunges of thinges, yet the bodye (being the house or har∣borer of the mynd) framed of the substance of claye or a thing of more corruption, doth so preuayle and ouercome the qua∣lytyes and gyftes of the mynde, in casting a myste of darke∣nes afore our vnderstandinge, that the soule is not only bar∣red to expose the frutes of reuelacion, but also it is not bele∣ued when she prognosticates a trothe, neyther is it in the po∣wer
of man to shone or shrinke frome that, whiche the fore∣knowledge of the highest hath already determined vpō vs, & much lesse to preuent or withstād the sentence of hym, whose dome is as certeine as himselfe is truthe, wherein because I am sufficiently sustefyed by thauthorities of dyuerse histo∣ries aswell sacred as prophane, I will not stande here to en∣large the proofe with copy of examples, but referr you to the readinge of the sequeile of this woful ladye, who although her fate was reueyled vnto her afore, yet was she denied to shone the destenye and sharppe iudgement whiche the hea∣uens were resolued to thunder vppon her. But nowe to our pourpose, thagrement thus made betwene the fayre greke Ladye and don SPADO the valiant Capteine, ther lacked no¦thing for consemacion of the mariage but thassistance of the rites and auncient ceremonies appoynted by order of holly churche, whiche the capteine forgat not to procure with all expedicion of tyme, and for the more honour and decoracion of the feast he had ther the presence of the marques of MAN∣TVA, beinge there not so much for the honour of the bryde∣grome, as to testefye to the open face of the world thearnest affection he bare to her fyrst husbande RARZO, whom he ac∣compted no lesse deare vnto hym for credytt and truste, then the nearest frende of his blod. But now this albanoys enioy, eng thus the frutes of his desier, colde not so wel brydel his present pleasure, nor conceile the singuler contentment he conceiued by the encounter of his new mystres, but in pub∣like show began to prate of his present felicitye, arguinge the same to be of greater moment, then if he had ben frank∣ly restored to the tytle and dygnitie of a kingdome, geuing fortune also her peculiar thanks, that had kept this good tor∣ne in store for him, saying yt she cold not haue honored him with a greater preferment then to put him into the possessiō of her who was without a second in al Europe. But as in e∣uery thing excesse is hurtful, bringinge with it a doble disco∣moditie, I meane both a sourfet to ye stomake by the pleasure we del ite in, & a Ielouse loathing of ye thing we chiefly loue
and hold most dere, so the extreme and superfluitye of hoate loue of this fonde husband towards his wife, began wtin the very month of the mariage, to conuert it selfe into a cōtrary disposition, not much vnlike the louing rage of the she ape to The proper∣tie of a she ape in embra∣sing. her youn¦ge ons. wards her yongeones, who as ye poetes do affirme doth vse to chuse amōg her whelpes one whō she loues best, & kepīg it alwaies in her armes doth cherish & loll it in such rude sorte that or she is ware she breketh the boanes and smothereth it to death, killing by this meanes with ouermuch loue ye thing which yet wold liue if it were not for thexcesse of her affectiō, in like sort this ALBANOYSE doating without discracion vppon the desyer of his newe lady, & rather drowned beastely in the superfluitie of her loue, thē waighing rightly the me∣ryte & vertue of true affectiō, entred into such tearmes of fer¦uent Ielowsie, yt euery fle that wasteth afore her, made hym sweate at the browes with the suspicion he had of her bewty, wherin he suffereth him selfe to be so much subiect & ouer∣come with ye rage of this follie, that according to the Ielow∣se humor of thytalyan, he thoughte euery man that loked in her face, wente aboute to grafte hornes in his forehed, Oh smal discreciō, and lesse wisedome in one that ought with ye shappe and forme, to merite the name & vertue of a mā, what sodaine chaung & alteraciō of fortune seames nowe tassayle this valiāt captein, who earst loued loyallie wtin the compas of raisō & now doating without discrecion, thinketh him selfe one of the forued ministeres of cornwaile, & albeit I must cōfesse vnto you yt ye more rare & precious a thīg is of it selfe, yt more diligēce & regarde ought we to vse to preserue & kepe it in good estate, yet a wise and chast womā being one of ye rarest things of the world & special gift of god, ought not to be kept in ye mew nor garded wt curious & continual wach, & much lesse atended vpō wc ye ielouse eyes of Argus, for like as shee yt waigheth her ho¦nor & life in indifferēt ballance, not meaning to exchange the one but wt the losse of the other, is not easely corrupted by a∣ny sugred traine of flattering loue, so ye restraint of ye lyberty of womenne, to gether with a distruste procedinge of none occasion, is the chiefeste meane to seduce her that ells
hath vowed an honeste and integrety of lyfe euen vntill the ende of her naturall dayes, And in vaine goeth hee aboute to make his wife honest, that eyther lockes her in his camber or fylles his house full of spyes to note her doinges, conside∣ringe the iust cause he gyues her hereby to be reuenged of the distruste he hath of her with out occasion, seinge with al the nature of some women is to enlarge their libertie that is abridged theim in doinge the thinge they are forbidden more in disspyte of the distruste of their folyshe husbandes then for any appetyt or expectacion of other contentment to themselues, neyther hath this folyshe humor of Ielowzy so much power to enter into the hart of the vertuous and wise man, who neyther wyll giue his wife suche cause to abuse her selfe towardes hym, nor suspect her wythout great occa∣syon, nor yet, gyue iudgement of any euill in her, withoute a sewer grounde and manifest proofe, and yet is he of suche gouernemente for the correction of such a falte, that he had rather cloke and disgest it with wisedome, then make publi∣cation with open ponishement in the eye of the slaunderous worlde, by whiche rare patience and secret dissimulation, he dothe not onely choke the mouth of the slaunderor, bu∣ryinge the falte with the forgetfulnes of the facte, but also reclaymes her to an assured honestie and fayth hereaf∣ter, that earst had abused him by negligence and yl fortune: but he which pennes his wife in ye higest vaulteof his house, or tieth a bell at her sleue because he may heare whether she goeth, or when he takes a long iorney paintes a lambe of her bellie, to know if she plaie false in his absence, these sleightes I saye do not only deceiue him that deuiseth theym, but also giues him for his trauell the true title of coockeholde, in like sort what greater signe or argument can a man geue of his owne follie, then to beleue that to be true, which is but dout¦full, and yeldinge rashelie to the resolution and sentence of his owne conceites, thinks his wife as light of the seare and apt to deceiue him, as he is readie to admit synister suspici∣on, which procedes but of an ymperfection in hym selfe,
iudging the disposition of an other, by his own complerion, which was one of the greatest faltes in this valyante ALBA NOYSE, who fearing euen nowe that which he nede not to dowte, began to stande in awe of his owne shadow, perswa∣dinge him selfe, that his wife was nolesse liberall of her loue towards others, then to him, and that the benefit of her bew¦tie was as common to straungers as to him selfe, albeit the good Ladye espyeng well enough, the gréefe of her husband, was not ydle for her parte, to studie the meanes to please him, and also to frame her life in suche wise euery waye that her chaste and discrete gouernment towardes hym, mighte not only remouethe vaile of his late susspicion, but also take awaye the thicke miste of frantike Ielowsie, that put him in suche disquiet and made him so farr excede the lymites and bondes of discrecion, albeit her honeste endeuor herein re∣ceiued a contrarye effecte, and as one borne vnder a crabbed constellacion, or ordeined rather to beare the malice of a fro∣ward desteinye, she cold not deuise a remedie for his disease nor any hearbe to purge his suspicious humor, but the more she sought to prefer a show of sinceritie and honestie of life, the more grew the furye and rage of his peruerse fancie, thinking the compainye and fellowship of his wife, to be as indifferente to others, as peculiar to him selfe. What life were like to the maried mans state, or pleasu∣res semblable to the ioyes of the bedde, if either the one or the other might be dispensed with all from the furye of frantique Iellowsie, or amōgest a thousand inconueniences which on∣ly the maried man doth fynde? what greater mischiefe maye be more for the dissolutiō of the mutual tranquilitie of them bothe, then where the one loues vnfaynedlie, and the other is doubtfull without cause, but the ease and quiet of men are of so small a moment, and their common pleasures so enter∣larded with an ordinarie mishappe, that ther is as smal hold of the one, slippinge away with the shortnes of tyme, as vn∣dowted assurance to haue the other a common gueste, and haunt vs in all our doinges, not leauing vs till he hath sene
vs laide in the pit and longe bedd of rest, wherof I haue here presented you a litle proofe in the picture and person of this selly ALBANOYSE, who beginnynge as you haue harde, to enter into some tearmes of Iellowsie wyth his wife, with whom notwithstandynge hee had consumed certeine monethes in such pleasures as mariage doth allowe, began to grow more feruent in that furye, thenne either his cause did require or wisedom ought to suffer, wherwt setting abroch the vessell of that poyson, forgat not for hys fyrste ende∣uor to dogge the doinges of hys wife with secret spies in e∣uerye corner, to abridge her libertie in goinge abrode, and barr the accesse of any to come to her, kepynge notwith∣standinge no lesse watche and warde abowte her chamber, thenne the good soldiour vppon hys trenche, or cir∣cumspecte Capteine vppon the walles of hys fortresse, whyche broughte the selly Ladye into suche sorow, that the state of the caytife and slaue of the gallye bownde to his ore with a chayne of vnreasonable biggnes, or hée that by harde sentence of the Lawe dothe lye miserablie in the bottom of a pryson all the dayes of his lyfe, seamed of more easie regarde thenne the harde condition of her presente state, albeit true vertue hathe suche operation and effecte of her selfe, that howe greuouslye soeuer the worlde dothe perse∣cute her, or seke to crucifye her wyth the malice of menne, yet canne they not so kepe her vnder by anye force they canne deuise, but certeine streames and sparkes wyll Fiue vertue vvill alvvayes yeldes frutes according to the goodnes of the thing, burste oute nowe and thenne, and showe her selfe at laste (as shee is hable) to wythstande the violence of any mortall affliction, whereof an affecte appeares here in the sequeile of this Greke ladye, who notinge the disposition of her husbande, ouercharged wyth a mad humor of wrong conceites, gaue iudgemente ymedyatlye of his disease, and beynge not hable vtterlye, to expulse his newe feuer, studied by her indeuor to inferr a moderacion of his passion, wherin for her part, she forgat not to make pacience her chie∣fest defence, agaynst the folish assaultes of his wilful follies, not only requitinge his extraordinary rage and fits of furie,
with a dutifull humylitye and obedience of a wife, but al∣so ceassed not to loue him no lesse then her honour and dutie bounde her therunto, hopinge with thassistance of some con∣uenient tyme, and her discrete behauior towardes hym, both to take awaye the disease, and mortefie the cause of his e∣uill she seamed neyther to reprehend his falte openly, nor wt other tearmes thenne argued her greate humilitie, and for her selfe, howe euill soeuer he intreated her, shee gaue an outwarde showe of thankefull contentmente, and when it was his pleasure to shutt her close in a chamber, as a birde in the cage, shee refused not his sentence, but embrasinge the gifte of her presente fortune, toke suche consolation as the harde condition of her case wolde admitt, giuinge god thankes for his visitation, and crauinge with like intercessi∣on to haue her husbande, restored to the vse of his former wittes: Albeit all these dutifull showes of obedience, and pa∣cient disgesting of his vnnatural discourtesies, together wt a rare and redie disposition in her to frame herselfe whollie to thappitit of his will, preuailed no more to enlarge her libertie, or redeme her from the seruile yoke of close ym∣prisonement, then to reclayme his hagarde mynde to thun∣derstandinge of reason, or restore the traunce of his fran∣tique humor, raging the more (as it seamed) by the incredi∣ble constancye he noted in this mirror of modestie, obedi∣ence, wisedome, and chastetie, whose example, in theym all deserues certeinlye to be grauen in pillers of eternetie, and honge vpp in tables of golde, in euerye pallace and place of estate, to thende that you ladyes of oure tyme, maye learne by ymitacion of her order and gouernement, to atteine to the like perfection of vertue, whiche she lefte as a speciall pat∣terne to you all, to thend also that if any of you by likemis∣fortune, do fal into the daunger of semblable accidentes, you may learne here thorder of your gouernement, in the like af¦faires, and also to suppresse ye rage of Ielowsie rather by ver∣tue, then force, which commonly is the foundacion of skan∣dale and slaunder, deuorcemente & violacion of mariage,
vpon doth consequētly ensue ciuil discenciōs, & vtter subuer ciō of houses of antiquitie: but now to ye place of our historie. This frantique ALBANOYSE and Ielouse capteine, being one of the traine of the lord Iames TRIVOVLSE a great fa∣uorer of the faction of GEBALYNO in Italye, and at that tyme gouernor of the duchie of MILLAYNE vnder ye fren∣che kinge, LOYS the thirde of that name, whether it were to make a further proffe, of the pacience of his wife, or by ab∣sence to mortefie and forgett, his fonde opinion, conceiued without cause, retired vpon a soddaine to Neweastel, ye court and ordenarie place of abode, of ye sayd Lord TRYVOVLSE, which albeit was of hard disgestion, to the ladie for a time, yet beinge not vnaquainted with such chaunces, and no pren tise in the practise of her husbande, retired to her auncient patience, and contentment by force, dyssimuling with a new greefe and secrete sorowe, this newe discourtesie, to thende that her waspishe husbande, should take no excepcions to her in any respect, but fynde her in this, as the former stormes, bent wholly to obey thappetit of his will, and not to mislike with that whyche he fyndes necessarye to be don. This TRIVOVLSE hadde not spente many monethes in fraunce, but there was commenced informacion agaynste him to the king, that he was reuolted from the frenche, and become frend to the Swytzers, and sworne to their seigneu∣rye and faction, wherewyth ymediatelye fame the com∣mon  the cō∣mon catyer of tales. carier of tales) filled all eares of MILAN, and the prouince there about, with this further ddicion, that the king for that cause, had sēt him headles to his graue, albeit as fame is rather a messenger of lyes, then a treasure of truthe and ra her to be harde, then beleued, so this brute beinge not true in the laste, did ymporte a certeine credit in the fyrste for TRYVOVLSE not liking to liue in the displeasure of his prince, abandoned his charg, and came into Lumbardy, wher beinge sommoned by the messenger of deathe, gaue place to nature and dyed, who beinge the onelye maister and meyn∣teynor of the ALBANOYSE capteine whilest bee liued, colde not casely be forgotten of him after his death, for after his de∣parture
was past, the general doubte of the people, and eche voice resolued, that he was laide in hys graue, Don Capi∣taino spado, resolued whollye into teares, seamed here to pass, the mistery of a newe traunce, whiche with the freshe re∣membraunce of his auncient harme, and gréene wounde of vnworthie Ielowsye, bledynge yet in his minde, broughte hym in that case, that he neyther desyred to liue, nor doubted to die, and yet in dispaire of theim both: his solace of the daye was conuerted into teares, and the howers of the night went awaye in vistons and hollowe dreames, he loa∣thed the companye of his frendes, and hated the thynges that shoulde susteine nature, neither was he contented with the presente, nor cared for the chaunce of future tyme, which sodaine alteracion in straunge maner, driue his carefull wife, into no lesse astonishement then she had cause, and being ignoraunt of the occasion, she was also voide of con∣solation, which doubled her gréefe, till tyme opened her at laste a meane to communicate familiarly with hym in this sorte, Alas syr (sayth she), to what ende serue these pininge conceites, forcing a generall debilytie thorow al your parts? or why do you languishe in griefe, without discoueryng the cause of youre sorowe, to suche as holde your health no lesse deare then the swéete and pleasant taste of their owne lyfe? from whence cōmes this often chāge of complexion, accōpa∣nied with a dispositiō of malencolicke dompes arguing your inward & fretting care of minde? why staye you not in time ye source of your skorching sighes, that haue alredye drayned your bodye of his wholsome humours appointed by nature to giue sucke to thintrals and inward partes of you? and to what ende serueth this whole riuer of teares, flowynge by such abundance frō your watery eyes almost worne awaye with wéeping? is your gréefe growen great by cōtinuance of time, or haue you conceiued some mislike of newe? Yf your house be out of order in any sorte, or that wante of dutie or diligence in me procureth your grudge, declare the cause, to thende the faulte maye be reformed in me, and you restored
to your aūciēt order of quiet, & we both enioye a mutual trā∣quillitie as apperteineth. But he that labored of an other disease then is incidēt cōmonly to men of good gouernemēt, absolued her of all faultes or other mislikes he founde in the state of his house, or other his affaires committed to her or∣der, & lesse lacke of her diligence to make declaracion of her dutye to thutermoste, but alas saith he, with a depe sighe de∣riued of the retinge dolour of his minde, and doubled twise or thrise within his stomacke afore he coulde vtter it, what cause of comfort or consolation hath he to lyue in this world, from whom the malice of destenie hath taken the chiefeste pillor of his life, or to what ende serueth the fruicion or interest of longer yeres in this vale of vnquietnes, when the bodie abhorreth alredie the longe date of his abode heare? or why shold not this soma or masse of corrupcion which I re∣ceiued of the world, bée dismissed to earth, and my soule haue leaue to passe into the other worlde, to shonne this double passion of present torment whiche I féele by the death of my deare frende? Ah my deare Ladye and loyall wyfe, my grief is so great, that I dye to tell you the cause, and yet the veray remembrance presents me with treble torments, wherin (I must confess vnto you, that since the death of the late Lorde Ihon Tryuulso, I haue had so lytle desyer to lyue, that all my felicitie is in thinking to die, neyther can ther be any thinge in the world more acceptable to me then death, whose hower and time, if they wer as certeine, as himselfe is moste sewer Albeit death is most cer∣teine, yet the hovver and time of his cōming is not knovven. to cōme in the ende, I could somwhat satisfye the greate de∣syer I haue to die, & moderate the rage of my passion in thin∣king of the shortnes of the dome that should giue ende to my dyeng ghost and vnrulye sorowes together? besides waig∣hing thininite miseries of our time, (accompanieng vs euē from the wombe of concepcion) with the reaste and reapose which dead men do finde, And knowing withall how muche I am in the debte of him that is dead, I can not wishe a more acceptable thinge then the spedie approche and ende of my dayes, to thende that being denied the viewe of his presence
here I may folow him in thother world, where participating indiferently such good and euil as falleth to his share, I may witnes with what duetiful zeale & affectioned harte I sought to honor and serue hym in all respectes. But the Ladye that sawe as farre into the disease of her husbande, as his phizici∣on into his vryne, knowynge well enoughe that he dyd not languishe so muche for the desyer of hym that was dead, as the ticklishe humour of Ielowsye troubled hym, was con∣tent to admit his coollours (howe fyne so euer they were) as∣well to preferr her dutie to thuttermoste, as also to auoyde imputacion or cause of suspicion on her parte, wherwith en∣tring into termes of persuacion, she added also this kynde of consolacion folowinge.

Albeit beinge deliuered of his traūce, and restored to the benefit of his speche, he disclosed vnto her the true cause and circumstaunce of his gréefe in this forte. Albeit since the time of my sicknes (saith he) you haue séene what distresse and desolation haue passed me, wyth fyttes of straunge and diuerse disposition, marueilynge no lesse (I am sewer) from what fountaine haue flowed the Symp∣tomes of so race a passion, wherein also your continuall pre∣sence and iewe of my weake state is sufficientlye hable to recorde the whole discourse of my disease, yet are you ney∣ther partaker of my payne, nor priuye to the principall cau∣ses of so straunge an euill, neyther haue I bene so hardie to discouer theim vnto you because I haue ben hetherto doubt∣ful of that, whereof your laste wordes haue fullye absol∣ued me. And nowe, being weakened with the wearines of tyme & sicknes, in suche sort, as nature hath ridd her handes of me, and gyuen me ouer to the order of death, who is to

And be∣cause I wil cleare in few wordes the misterie which seames to amaze you. You shall note that there be iij. onely mini∣sters and occasyons of my disease, whereof the firste, (and of leaste importance) is for the death of my late Lorde and maister, Don Ihon tryuoulso whereof you are not ignorant, the second (excedinge the firste in greatnes of grefe and force againste me) is to thinke that the rigour of my desti∣nies, and violence of sicknes, yeldynge me into the handes of death, will dissolue and breake by that meanes, the league of longe and loyall loue whiche from the beginnynge my harte hath vowed vnto you, but the thirde and laste, (of a more strange qualitie then eyther of the reste) is to thinke that when I am dead, and by time worne out of your minde, an other shal enioye the swéete and pleasaunt benefit of that deuine beautie of yours, whiche oughte to serue but for the dyet of the gods, the simple viewe whereof seames hable (yf it wer possible) to make me sufferye martiredom of ij. deaths, wherunto she replied wt persuacions to driue hym from his fonde deuise, profering her selfe eftesones to dye for com∣panie, wherin (callynge the maiestie of the highest to wit∣nes,) she protested againe, that if he wolde not be reclaimed from his desyer to dye, within a veray shorte moment of tyme, she woulde bée as redye to yelde death his tribute as he, all whiche she inferred (I thinke) rather to féede the tyme, then of intent to performe the effecte of her offer, hauynge the lyke opynion of her husbande, whome she thoughte alwayes to haue suche power to represse the euil sprite that possessed hym, ythe woulde not become the vn∣naturall morderer of hymselfe and muche lesse execute the lyke rage on her. But alas thinfortunat Ladye, brewed heare the brothe of her owne bane, and spon the thred of her owne destruction, for fallynge nowe vnhappelye in∣to

Marke here (good Ladyes) the desolation of this vnfortu∣nat Gentlewoman, and dispose your selues to teares on the behalfe of her distresse, wherin certeinlye you haue no lesse reason to helpe to bewaile her wretched chaunce, then iuste occasion to ioyne in generall exclamation, againste the de∣testable acte of her tyrannous husband, who disclayminge euen nowe his former state and condition of a man, retires into thabite of a monster, and cruell enemye to nature, and in conuertinge the vertue of his former loue and remem∣brance of the sondrie pleasures he had heretofore receyued of his deare and louynge wyfe, into present rage and vnna∣turall furye, far exceding the sauage and brutishe maner of the Tiger, Lyon, or Libards, bredd in the desertes of affrike the common Norsse of monsters, and creatures cruell with∣out reason, whettyng his téeth for the terrible suggestion of the deuill, who at thinstant put into his hande the dagger, wherewith after he had embraced and kissed her in such sorte as Iudas kissed our Lorde the same night he betraied him, he Here he kil∣leth his vvyf. saluted her with ten or .xij. estockados, one in the necke of an other in diuerse partes of her bodye, renewynge the con∣filict with no lesse nomber of blowes in her head and armes, and because no parte shoulde escape frée frō the stroke of his malice, he visyted her white and tender legges, with no lesse rage and furye then the rest, wherewith beholdinge in her diuerse vndoubted argumentes of death, began the lyke warre wyth hymselfe, vsinge the same meane and mini∣sters with his owne handes, enbrewed yet with the bloode of his innocent wyfe, she wyng (notwithstandyng this horrible part and acte of dispaire) diuerse and sondrye signes of speci∣all gladnes and pleasure in his face, wherin he contynued till the laste and extreame gaspe of lyfe, chieflie for that he sawe him accompanied to death with her, whome he was not hable to leaue behinde hym on lyue, and who (beinge ouer∣charged as you haue harde) with the nomber of woundes, the violence whereof, (preuailinge farr aboue the resistance of lyfe) did presse her so muche with the hastie approche of
death that the want of breath abridged her secret shryft and cōfession to god, with lesse leasure to yeld her innocent soule (wyth humble praier) into the handes of her redemer, and commende the forgeuenes of her synnes to the benefit of his mercie. Only she had respyte (with great a do to speake) to giue order that her bodie might be layde in the tombe of her firste husbande SIGNEVR BARZO. But the cursed and execrable ALBANOYS (so whollie possessed with the deuill, that the gyfte of grace was denied him) abhorred to the laste mynute of his lyfe, the remem∣brance of repentance, for laughinge (as it were) at the fowlenes of the facte euen vntill life left him senceles and voyde of breathe, he commended his carkes to the gredie Iawes of rauenous wolues, seruing also as a fyt praie for ye venemous serpentes and other crepinge wormes of the ear∣the, and his soule to the reprobate socyetie of Iudas and Cayne with other of thinfernall crewe. The worthie ende of this wicked wretche, argueth the iuste rewarde of the euill disposed, and suche as are vnhay¦pelie dropped out of the fauor of god, the ordenarye successe of those enterprises, that are begn without the consente of wisedom or raison, but chiefly theffectes and fortune of such as (blinded with the vaile of their owne wil) and dymned wt the myst of follye, do reapose so muche for theim selues in the opinion of their owne witte, that detestinge good councell and thaduise of the wise, doo credit onlye the conceite of their owne fancie, whiche (as a blinde guide) doth leade them into infynit miseries & laborinth of endles annoye, where there is no dispense of their follie, but losse of libertie, perpetual infamie, and sometime punishemente by vntimely deathe, whyche as they bée worthie rewardes, for suche as doat so much in their owne wisedome, that they accompte the same hable of it selfe, to comprehend the whole globe, or compasse the worlde, So the wise man affore he en∣treth into any enterprise of waight (beinge carefull for the conueighe of the same) dothe not onlye compare the ende wyth the beginning, and cast the sequiel and circumstance euerye waye, but also entringe (as it were) into hymselfe,
he makes a view of that which is in hym, and for his better assistance, he will not refuce the aduise of his frends, by whi∣che meanes he is sewer to reape the rewarde of his trauell with treble contentmente, and seldom is he punished with to late a repentance: Herewith also thexample of the wise ma∣ryner A comparisō deriued of the pollicie vvhiche the vvise mariner or shipmais∣ter doth vse, (doth in like sorte aduise vs, who comming by fortune or violence of wether vpon an vnknowen coaste, doth strai∣ght way sounde and trye the depth of the riuer by his plom∣met and lyne, neyther will he let fall his Anker onlesse he be sewer of the fyrmenes of the grounde, whiche if it do faile him, yet is hee to wythstande the malice of daun∣ger by kepinge the chanell, whiche yeldes hym water e∣noughe. So if this wretched ALBANOYS hadde made a view of himselfe & his forces, afore he became subiect to ye hu∣mor of Ialouse suspicion, or if he had giuen correction to his falte in tyme, and suffred reason to suppresse the rage of his follie, afore he was growen to tearmes of madnes, he had enioyed his Ladie at pleasure, lyued yet in quiet, and preuen¦ted the fowle note of infamie, wherewith the gates and pos∣ternes of his house wilbe painted, till thextreme date of the world, and eschewed the peril of dampnable dispair inkilling himselfe, with like violacion and bloddie slaughter, of his in nocēt lady, whose death with ye straūgenes in executiō, being once knowē to the multitude it is to be wōdered what gene∣rall dule and desolation, were in all partes of the citie, how al estates and degres of people spared no sortes of teares, nor other dollerous tunes, bewailinge her misfortune, with se∣ueral grudges at the malice of her destinies, that in such cru¦el maner toke frō amōgest them, yt persō of her, whose vertu¦es & other ornamentes of God & nature, serued as a special mirror or loking glasse to al ages: wherin certeinlie they had great reason, for a lady or gentle womā, equal with her in cō¦uersacion Giftes vvhich ought to ap∣peare in an honest vvo∣man. euexye way, I meane chast without argument of dishonestie, deuowt and yet hatinge supersticion, bowntiful without wasteful prodigalitie, wise without vaine vaunting so obediente towardes her husbande as was necessarie, and lastlie lackinge the furniture of no good vertue,) can not be

The argument. BEcause I haue already in diuerse places suf∣ficientlye deciphered the forces of loue, and what effectes he exposeth, hauing once brued the cuppe of the pleasant poison of our sensu∣al appetyt, whereō whosoeuer Syppeth, swa¦loweth iustelye the rewarde of suche follies: I maye the rather be dispensed wythall eftsones to reitterate in this place, that whiche earste hathe bene inferred touchinge the awe whiche that passion hathe ouer the hartes of those, whose destenie yeldes theim subiecte to so great an euill, Beinge bolde withall to note as a principle or rule of ge∣neralitie, that, that infection procedes rather of the corrup∣cion Loue Proce∣des of the cor¦rupcion of our ovvne na¦ture. of our owne nature, then of the perfection of the same: Albeit some vaine philosophers are not ashamed to ad∣uowch his beginning of the moste perfect partes that are in the spirite of man, wherein I see neyther authoritie to al¦lowe their saing, nor reason to confirme their opinion, on∣les they will make it meritorious for thindiscretion and follies whiche appeare in theim that participat with such passion, for a familiar testymonie wherof, I haue preferred this historie folowing, not only affirminge my former pro¦testacion touchinge the disordinat effectes of loue, but also to iustefye the opynion of him who makes no difference, betwene the deuise of loue, and raginge fyttes of frenezy, or one posseste with a wicked spirite, for here you maye see a gentleman of Myllan (to enioye a presence and plea¦sure of his La refuseth not to cōmit himselfe to mani∣fold daungers, with diuerse perillous encounters, wherof the one seamed no lesse mortal then the other, and euerye one threatening the end of his life by present morder, albe∣it his felicitie defended him from harme, and the peril pas∣sed makes him dread a future plunge,
SONDRYE PERILLS, happeninge to a yonge gentleman of Myl∣lanin the poursewte of his Ladye NOt longe after MAXYMILIANS FOR∣CE by the guide of euill fortune, & wante of good gouernmente in himselfe, hadde lost the state and seigneurye of MILLAN there happened no lesse desolation to the vnhappie faction of the GEBELYNS, whō the power and pollecie of the great TRI∣VOLSO did not only abandon their natu∣rall soyle and place of a bode, dryuinge theym from the pos∣session of their worldlye porcions, but also persecuted their wretched state with suche creweltie, that they were readie to yelde to the somonce of dispare, if it had not bene for the simple proffer of a certeine hope, they reaposed in thassis∣tance of themprour MAXIMILIAN, who more willing then hable to restore their desolation, pursewed the reuenge of their wronge wyth a puissant armye euen vntill the walls and gates of MILLAN: where he receyued suche hoat repul∣ses by the valyaunte encounters of Charles Duke of Burbon (thenne viceroye or deputie to the frenche kynge) that pain∣tynge the gates wyth the blod of hys capteines, and leauing the deade bodyes of hys people in witnes of his beyng there, the maiestie retorned wythe more commendacion for hys good meanynge, thenne fame or glorye of the victorie, lea∣uyng the miserable sradyates (bathed in the teares of their seconde sorowe) to the guide and gouernemente of their for∣tune, who seamed at laste to enter into suche compassion of their miserie, that shee restored the greateste parte not only to the libertie of their contrey and societie of former haby∣tacion,
but also to chuse of their goodes and reuenues vsur∣ped by the enemie: the rest shee deuided into diuerse corners of christendom, som went to Trent and were sworne the sub∣iectes of Francis Sforce Duke of Bary, other found place of abode in the kingdom of Naples, to some she gaue passeporte to at∣tempte the deuocion of the wholly vicar of rome, and the rest repaired to MANTVA: amongest whiche ewe or last com∣pany, was one CORNELIO (vpō whom this history maketh his chiefest discourse) whom albeit fortune had made parta∣ker of her malice amongest the reste of his contreymen, yet hys mynd grudging with thiniurye of fate, loste nothing of her entyer and vertue, for notwithstandinge hee was of the race of the SFORCIANS, and chiefest enemye to the vsur∣ped gouernement and prowde behauior of the frenchemen wythin MILLAN, and that hee had lefte amongeste theim his inheritance and goodes to confiscacion, yet was he assis∣ted wyth so fyne a pollecye and great indeuor of his mother, that he had sufficient exhibicion to meinteyne his auncient porte and callinge. And as the statelie viewe and feyture of his complexion and lyms, presented a speciall conninge of nature, lackynge besides no gyfte or qualitie due to a gentleman and pestered wythall wyth no more yeres then were conueniente for the decoracion of so seamely a bewtie: So being the chiefe cour∣tier that hawnted the companie of Ladyes, and no lesse wel∣come amongest the lostie dames of MILLAN afore the sub∣uercion of their societie by the crueltie of the fren∣chemen, hee made a choise of one from amongeste the reste, whom he failed not to court wyth a contynual proffer of his seruice and other offices of humanitie prescrybed in the skole of loue, vntill he thought himselfe sufficientlye rampierd in the intralls of her hart, and left her no lesse willinge to yelde a perticipacion of affection, then himselfe passioned wyth de∣syer to pursewe the quest and conquere her bewtie, her name was PLAVDINA equall to him in the height of estate, and nothing inferior in the golden giftes and ornamentes of na∣ture?
And albeit she had newlie made a proofe of the maried mans pastyme, & offred the flower & first frutes of her vir gynitie vpon thalter of wedlocke: yet the youngnes of her yeres (defending her bewtie from al argumentes of alteraci∣on or chang) wolde not suffer the hoat and often encoun∣ters of her husbande, to ympaire any waye the glasse or pre∣cious dye of so rare a perfection: wherein as she was noted ye odd peragon of Italy aswell for that respecte, as other orna∣mentes of maiestie incydente to honor: So the commenda∣cion of these vertues seamed not so fyt an instrument to ad∣uance her fame and glorye, as presente meanes to pro∣cure treble passion to the new disquiet of CORNELIO, who greued not so muche wyth the sentence of aduersitie, as cry∣ed out of the Lawe of nature and malice of his presente for∣tune, for that the one had geuen hym a harte to loue, and li∣bertie to chuse, and the other being his guide in the toile and trauell of his sute, toke hym awaye when hee attended to reape the frutes of his harueste, but that whiche broughte more oyleto hys matche, and kindled the coales of freshe dis∣quiett was, that albeit he knewe hym selfe to be reciprocal∣lie loued, or at leaste nere the good wyll of his ladye, yet was hée voyde of meanes and mynisters to solicite hys cause, or bewraie that whyche hee durste not discouer, other thenne thamarous regardes and glaunces of the eye, wyth certeine sighes and secret wringing of the hande, and Secret solici∣tors of the in¦vvard affecti∣on of the harte. kisses gotten by stealthe in corners, whiche albeit argued a likelihod and SIMPATHYA of affection, ympartinge an e∣qualitie of desyer to the hartes of theim both, yet the one be∣inge affraied to geue the charge, and the other ashamed to resigne without any alaram, seamed bothe plonged indiffe∣rentlye in a passion of doubt and feare, vntill loue (whose af∣faires can not well bée dispatched without thassistance of a thirde) quarellinge with the simplicitye of Cornelio, presen∣ted him with a messenger conueniente for the conueighe of their buysines: for there was a pore Swaine, sometime ser∣uing as a drudge to the mother of CORNELIO, and nowe
preferred to his Ladye PLAVDINA in the rowmthe of her wagyner or coache dryuer, whose office as it was alwayes to go by the doare of her coache when her pleasure was to isyt places of solace, and take open ayre in the feldes, so rea∣posinge muche for himselfe in the fidelitie of his slaue, thin∣king to enioyne a greater credit to thauthorytie of his small office, admitted him in his hart the aptest coll carier betwene hym and his Ladye: wherfore after he had contured hym by feare and faire promisses to adowe his diligence to hutter∣moste, wyth no lesse secrecye, then wisedom, and conuenient expedicion at al tymes, he made a firste proofe of his pollecie and fyne conueighe of his charge, in the delyuerye of a letter, whiche be willed him to presente vnto PLAVDINA, thinward affection and disposition of whose hart, as hee mea∣sured by the messages of her eyes, so he preferred his seruice & boarded her good wil wt these tearmes: If it were not good Cornelio vvri¦teth to plau∣dyna madam that euerye state and condicion of man, were subiect to his peculyar desaster, and that the noble hart (made of a de∣licat mettal) is more full of affections and apte to enclyne to the loare of loue, then the rest of the rude and harbarous people, I woulde thinke that the passion whyche pinchethe suche as do loue, were a skourge and due correction sente from aboue, for a chastismente of their lostye and wanton ymagynacions, but seinge it is moste sewer that nature hath put a certeine difference betwene the dispositions of her crea∣tures, wyth a desier to pursewe the sommonce of her insti∣gacion accordinge to the priuiledge of their degrée, it is not in our power to disclaime thinstructions of such a guide, nor degenerat from thinstinct of that destenie geuen vs in oure conception, wherin as the noble mynde loathinge the enter∣pryse of base or vile condicion, delites in such conquestes as yelde moste fame or commendacion, So you oughte not to meruaile, if the glymeringe beames of your rare bewtie, paynted by deuine arte in the forefronte of your face, the a∣doracion whyche all men yelde to youre singler vertues,

The Ladye being darted afore with the desyer of Cornelio, and wold gladly haue entred the listes and gyuen the onset, if it had not bene for the respect of her honour, was nowe so wounded to the quicke, that she fel into tearmes of commē∣dacion of her chaunce, blissynge the goodnes of her fortune,
that had not onely planted her affection in so highe a place, but (yeldynge her rewarde wyth semblable glée) hath made her the mystres of hym, whom her hart had alredye chosen and admitted into vndoubted fauor, whiche she confirmed eftesones with such tearmes of gratulation and arguments of present gladnes, that yf the remorce of shame and re∣putacion of her honor, hadde not bene impedimentes to the desyer of her harte, cloasinge her mouth againste the present conceytes of ioye in this newe societie, she had im∣mediatlye dismissed the messenger, with absolute assurance to performe the request of him that sent hym: wherof albeit shame seamed to abridge the expedicion, and offer causes of staye for the time, yet wantynge force to mortifye altoge∣ther the humour of ragyng desyer, the was driuen to gyue place to the prouocation of loue, who deuestinge her of ho∣nest shamfastnes, whiche oughte to be the chiefe habite and decoracion of the beautie of greate Ladyes, willed her to de∣ferre no lenger the thynge she had alredye vowed, & seynge ye iniurie of present tyme, denied her to satisfye hym as she woulde, at leaste to yelde hym suche contentement as she maye: wherfore takynge pen, ynke and paper, she replied to his letter wyth this aunswere. The circumstaunce of your present letter (syr) seames to Plaudyna aunsvvereth the letter of her seruant. argue an excepcion against the frendly lookes and glaunces of mine eyes, wherin albeit I could note a great simplicitie & want of discrecion in him, that constreth the regardes of a Ladye (cast at vnwares) to the commoditye of hymselfe in wynninge the good will of her that meaneth nothing lesse, then to make them the Ministers of loue: yet beinge more ready to content you therin, then curious of mine owne be∣hauiour, I am to acquite you of imputacion that waye, and cōuert ye note of ye follie to the ouersight of my selfe. And al∣beit the pleasant encounter of mine eys, seaming more libe∣ral on your behalf, with a familiaritie more thē ordinarie to al men, may persuade a certein differēce I haue put betwen the frendship of you & respect of any other, with desyer to em∣brace
you aboue any one creature. Yet was I of opiniō that your sondrye vertues & reputation of honor, would not suf∣fer you to chalenge me for the firste faulte, or to conuerte theis regardes of simple and colde fauor into suche conse∣quence, as to attempte the violation of that, which mine ho∣nor grudgeth to lose, and the vowe of faith to my husbande forbiddes me to depart withall: notwithstanding I yelde you no lesse thankes for your curtesye then you seame to gyue commendacion to my beautye and other giftes you note in me, accomptinge the same of greater price, by the value and estimacion you make of them, neither wil I refuse ye proffer of your present frendship, which, (as I hope) is voyde of in∣tent to preiudice mine honor, so let it suffise you that I am not only contented to admit you into fauor, but also deter∣mined to hold you no lesse deare then the tendrest part of my selfe. And because letters (being incident to manye casual∣ties) are commonly the fyrst discloasers of the secretes of lo∣uers, my aduise is, that hensfurth you staye not only the di∣ligence of your pen, in sealing such great importance with∣in a dissemblyng pece of paper, but also be contented to com∣mit the whole conueighe of our busines to the credit of this bringer, who is to yelde you salutacion on the behalf of her, who ioyeng no lesse in the vnitye of this frendship, then ha∣ting the thing that maie seame hurteful to the cōsommariō of the same, doth wishe your constancie of no longer conti∣nuance, then you shal fynde cause of credit in the loyaltie of your vnfayned. Plaudina. The report of this letter preferred such a possibilitie & likeli∣hode of good lucke to the Myllanoys, that dismissing euen now al argumēts of former doubte, he determined to accepte the offer of his fortune & pursue ye benefit of present time, wher∣in he was so furthered by the diligence of the minister and messenger of their loue, that theare seamed to want (for the fynall complote of theyr busynes) but only the consent of conuenient tyme & place, which had folowed accordingly, yf for the more assurance of the bargaine they had bryed the

And as the pleasant apple muste∣ring with delicate glée vpō the heyght of the highest spraise, is blowen down, with the least poffe of winde that breathes, and so oppressed wyth the violence of the fal, that the fruts is quyte taken awaye in the middest of his glory, so the case and quiet of man, is fauored wyth so small a moment of time, and subiect to so many chaunges, that we oughte ney∣ther esteme (so greatlye as we do) the tikle pleasures of so small abode, nor iudge assurance in suche vncerteine vani∣ties, seing withal the same is of suche malicious disposicion, that when we haue laied the fundation of oure pleasure and prosperitie, with full perfuacion to enioye our quiet with∣out controllement it is then that fortune discouereth her ambushs, and inuaoynge vs at vnwares wyth the furye of her malice, paieth our former pleasure wyth an interest of treble desolacion, that fayleth not to attende vs euen vntill our fatall days of reapose, whereof you maye note a familyar proffe in the sequeile of this CORNELIO, who be∣inge vppon the point to taste of the delicat frutes in loue, and embrace hys Ladye with suche contentement as louers do commonlye wishe, and seldome encounter, beholde the malice of the Frenche men began to rage wyth suche ex∣tremitie againste the lynage of the SFORCIANS, where∣of he was one of the chiefest) that he was dryuen to a∣uoyde the present daunger of hys lyse, wyth a soddaine fleight and secrete stealynge oute of the towne, wherin he was so hoatlye puriued with thextremitye of his perill, that beyng barred anye leasure to communicate wyth hys dearest frends, & lesse time to impart his mish ap to his lady, or once salute her with a simple farewell, which seamed not so greuous to himselfe, as of treble-dolour to the sorowfull
PLAVDINA, who distillynge no small nomber, of teares on the behalfe of the soddain departure and absence of her deare frende, and restored at laste to a moderation and patience by force, began to cast the circumstaunce of his daunger, wher∣in the ymagined all suche doubtes as eyther hope or feare coulde put in her head, somtime persuadynge, he should bee ouertaken and oppressed by the waye, and by and by she fea∣red leaste he were betrayed into the handes of his enemies, by the malice of such as he put intruste with his life, wherin she was no lesse doubteful of the one, then in dispaire of tho∣ther, and in such perplexitie with the conceite of them both, that she seamed no lesse passioned for the time, then if the enemies of her frende had cut her CORNELIO in peces a∣fore her face. And as she molde haue dismissed theis tragi∣call conceites of doubte & feare, and retired to a quiet, wyth exspectation of better fortune, she was sodainly assailed. with a seconde alarame in her hart, which mortifyenge all care of the well doinge of her absent CORNELIO, preferred a vehe∣ment desyer not onely to recouer hym (wherin appcared a greate impossibilitye) but also wishinge to bée a companyon of his iorney, and partaker of his miserye, she seamed to ex∣pose a franke of that whiche earste she was ash amed and made conscience to graunt, & as she was voyd of al com∣fort The  her bodye. in this calamitys, sauinge that the often remembrance of her frende, seamed to restore some litle contentement, so ymagininge that the breath of the ayre wolde cary the Eccho of her complaintes into the eares of hym that was gon, she saluted his absence with theis tearmes. All thinges ought to be hatefull to the eares, which seame hurteful to the quiet of the mynde, and yet one chiefe conso∣lation Plaudina menteth the absence of her frēd vvith complaint  gainste her ovvne misfor∣tune. wee fynde in miserye, is to recorde the circunstaunce of our misfortune, neither can that grief be of greate impor∣tance, whose cause is of small moment, but alas what sorow is semblable to the separacion of frendes? Ah CORNE∣LIO what auncient grudge procureth this newe mislike, or what offence haue I don of late, that makes me merito∣rious
of this greate discurtesye? Wyl thou paye the merite of my frendshypp wyth so vnthankefull a trybute, and a∣buse therspeaarion whiche all men had of thy vertue? haste thou plyed me to thappetit of thy wyll, and no we determi∣ned to leaue me in the greatest distresse of desyer to enioye thée? or canst thow vse so small regarde to the desolate state of the sorowfull PLAVDINA, as leauynge her hathed in the teares of vnderserued dule, to steale awaye, wyth oute the comfort of one simple adieu? What nedest thou haue doubted to commununicate wyth her, who hath alwayes reserued an equall care of thy sauetye, and her owne lyfe? And yf the loue thou haste vaunted to bere me, had bene matched wyth an vnfained meanynge of continuance and constancie, the feare of the enemy had not preuented thy comminge to me, for loue alas defyeth the malice of daunger, and perill is the thynge that least troubleth the harte that is trulye affectio∣nate: Loue este∣meth no daū∣ger. What comfort in my present miserie, or exspectation of future redresse, beinge out of hope eftesones to reclaime hym, that receyued but nowe the sentence of continuall exile? How am I plunged in a passion of double extremetie, meyther content to disclayme my affection, and lesse hable to dismisse the remembrance of hym that is the cause of my wo? I fynde nowe (alas to soone.) Howe iustelye we wo∣men mave exclayme againste nature, who framynge vs of a brickle moulde apte to yelde, and easye to be wonne, hath enioyned vs withall a certeine vehemencie of affecti∣on, pearsynge the harte wyth desyer in suche sorte, as be∣ing once thorowlye coyffed wyth loue, we are not onelye forsaken, when wée wishe thieflye to embrace the obiect of oure appetit, but also are subiect to abyde all sortes of re∣uenge of the ordinarye rigour of men. And what rigouro? wronge haue I offred the Dh CORNELIO wherof I haue not felte the firste apprehencion? For forcyng my selfe to yelde the contentement, I spared not the proffer of myne honour to purchasse thy frendshipp, and in gyuynge the assuraunce of my good wyll, I haue spotted the renowme
of my former reputacion, whereof the bloode of shame puttes me in remembraunce wyth grudge at so greate a faulte, and thy conscience is my present witnes of my vnfayned loyaltye: neyther wyll the flatteryng lynes of thy sondrie letters conceile this discurtesye, nor the messenger and faythfull solicitour of oure loue, forgett to re∣proche the of vnconstaunt behauyour to thy loyall PLAVDINA, who feelynge now what it is to lacke the societye of hym, whome the harte hath chosen to loue, is equallie pin∣ched wyth the panges of suche as plunged in the passion of desyer, do wyshe that they wante, and lacke the thynge they chieflye woulde haue, whereby they seame to norishe lyfe wyth the onely breathe of a simple and colde hope. But why am I so pertiall on myne owne behalfe, in exclaimyng againste the discurtesye of hym, who peraduenture deser∣ueth not theis tearmes of blame? or why doe I not rather respect the true cause of his departure, sturred vp (as it sea∣meth) by the necessitye of the tyme, forcinge hym to haban∣don his parentes, countreye and reuenue, onles he wolde quenche the thirste of his enemyes, wyth the abundance of his blood, and appease theyr malyce wyth the price of his heade, certeinlye the vertues and gyftes of CORNELIO acquite hym of all argumentes of inconstancie neyther can a bodye of so rare perfection harbor suche dyssemblynge disposicion. But as the desyerous harte is seldome at rest, The desye∣rous harte is seldom at rest and doubte∣full mindes dreede al∣vvayes de∣ceite. so the doubtefull mynde is dreadefull of deceite, and qua∣reliynge continuallye with his good hap or synister for∣tune, is alwayes in ymaginacion what iudgement to re∣solue vppon the condition of his owne estate, so my case is of no lesse perpleritie, for wafting indifferētly betwene happie chaunce, & euil successe, I fele my selfe double passioned, som∣time moued to reioice my good hap, in beīg loued of so honest curteouse, & noble a gentlemā as Cornelio, and by & by driuen to inueighe againste my euill fortune, that hath put suche distance and seperacion of oure bodies when we weare at
point to performe the consommacion of our acquaintaunce. And albeit the common chaunces of this worlde resemble a confection made of hony and gall, and that the banquettes of loue, beinge garnished with dishes of both sortes, will vs to make choice wyth deliberacion, alledgynge that the plea∣sure is not so great, as the repentaunce & penaunce of harde disgestion, yet I thinke the vertue to performe the vowe of the hart, takes awaye the greatnes and haynous disposicion of the faulte, wherefore seing my hart hath made his choice, and the reste of my partes resolued to performe the quest, I wyll not onelye dismisse all doubtes of the assurance of his good wyll, but studye to excede hym in affection, deuisinge the meanes from hensfurth, to make hym féele the force of my goodwill, with the desyer I haue to knitt an indissoluble vnitye of the ij. mindes, whose bodies are forced to lyue in seperacion by the malice of the worlde, and angrie dome of our fortune. Here yf PLAVDINA inueighed onely vpon ij. pointes of her desaster, the one for the soddaine departure of her frende and the other for the doubte she seamed to put in the assu∣raunce of his loue, it is to bée thoughte that CORNELIO had cause of treble complaint, bothe to be driuen to saue his lyfe by cowardlye flighte, to steale awaye in suche secret & scilent maner, as only his guide was pryuie to his goinge, & also to bée distressed with such shortnes of time, that he was barred to seame thankeful to his Ladye with a simple fare∣wel, whiche was sufficient to sturre vp her Ielous humour againste hym, but that whiche exceded the rest in greatnes of gréef, was that he had no man of trust to carye her newes of his being, and muche lesse durste he communicat his buy∣synes wyth any straunger, neyther had he hope to be aduer∣tised of the accurrantes of MYLLAN, nor meane to make reaport of his owne estate at MANTVA, for that he durst not discouer the place of his present abode there, wherefore cry∣eng out of the constellation and clymat of his destynies, he complained his vnhappie case in this sorte

I am sorye (saieth Cornelyo aunsvverethe the baude. he) the large honor and liberall offer whyche you seame to presente vnto me on the behalfe of your Lady and mystrys, is of a more highe momente, thenne eyther I am worthys to possesse, or hable to requite wyth equall merite, wherein because the harde condition of my presente state, seames my chiefeste enemye to soo greate a prefermente, I doubte howe to seame thankefull to her, and satisfye the tyme both together, albeit as thinges ympossible are not to bee pur∣sewed, and offences forced of necessitie are moste meritori∣ous of pardon, so beynge not hable to aunswere her exspecta∣cion in counterchaunge of affection, I am onlye to racke the litle tallent that is lefte me to so highe a pyn, that onlye shee shall dispose of my honor and lyfe wyth all that I haue in the worlde at her pleasure, whyche it maye like her to vse as a supplie of ye presēt dutie and seruice she demaundes at my hand, onelye being at this presente not the maister of my selfe, nor the vse of my harte in mine owne possession, my sute is that shee rather blame the wronge whiche time offreth to vs bothe, then note me of any disdayne in refusing the frendshippe of her, who merites more then I am hable to performe: for if my harte were as frée from forreine and former bondes, as shée deserueth to be serued, and that my affections did not excede thordenary ympressions whiche as∣saile the mynde of man, assure youre selfe shee shoulde not lyue longe vnsatysfyed to her contentmente, and muche lesse haue cause to enter into suspection of Ieleous disdaine in me, for retorning the offer of that which maye serue for a present to the greatest prince in ITALY: neyther will I so much abuse the proffer of her acquaintance, or cause of your cōming, as eyther her liberal offer, or vehemēcie of your im∣portunities on her behalf, shal moue me to resolue a worseo∣pynion or more slēder credyt on ye honor or honestie of her yt sente
you, desyeringe you for end to preferr my excuse accordinge to thintegretie of the same, with this further addicion and humble requeste, that she bee as bolde to employe me in any other respecte, no lesse amplye and so far furthe, as my honor and lyfe will extende: more honestlie (saithe the messenger) colde you not refuce the offer of that whyche earste was ne∣uer presented to any, and muche lesse so neare the poynte to make a price of so precious amarchandise, neyther do I thinke you worthie of the title of that courtesye, whereof you are commended, nor yet am I of mynde that youre harte is capable of the noble vertue of loue, seynge ye reno∣wne & honor of her, whose bewty only hath the greatest prin∣ces of Italye in awe, canne make no breache nor enter. And who woulde seame of so slender iudgemente (onlesse hee hadde quite disclaimed the order of reason) that beinge proffered frelie that, whiche princes can not get by any sute, and not onely desired, but pursewed wyth greate instance, wolde let slippe the gyft of so good a fortune, and make chip∣pes of the frendshippe of so faire and curteons a Ladye: wyth what face dare you visyt hereafter th assemblies of greate dames, hauynge committed so greate a falte on the behalfe of her, whose goodwill you do not deserue, if her cur¦tesye did not call you to that prefermēt? are you of opynion that the merite of your bewtie and other proporcion, excedes the honore and heighte of her that woeth you? ymagyn the same to bee of suche force, that it is hable to drawe Ladyes to doate of you euen vnto deathe, woulde you become so harde harted as to encrease your glorye, wyth thexployt of so great a crueltie? If you bee subiecte to soo fonde an hu∣mor, you muste nedes bee incydente to the iuste reuenge which the god of loue is readie to thonder vpon such as seame to hold his loare in skornful contempte, whereof as I haue harde mo examples, then my skill is hable to reueile in good order, being neuer trained in the torning ouer of volumes & histories, So I wishe chieflie the plage of NARCISSVS maye
put you in remembrance of your present ouersighte, leaste in disdaininge the frendshippe of such as excell your selfe e∣uery Narcissus doateth vpon his ovvne sha∣dovve. way, you doate vppon thymage of your owne shadowe, and by that meanes yelde treble vsurye to the wronge you offer her, whose loyall affection deserueth a better rewarde then the retorne of a repulse of so small ymportance: wher∣with CORNELIO cuttinge of the reste of her waspishe dis∣course, desyered her to presse him wyth no greater ymputa∣cion, then his offence deserued, for (saieth he) in tearminge me vnworthie of the title of curtesye, and that my hart is to harde to admit the impression of loue, you rather slaunder me by ignorance, then accuse me by iustice, seinge the onlye force of loue hath forced alreadie a vowe of my affection and harte to a Ladie of MILLAN, whose presence albeit thini∣quitie of fate hath taken from me for a time, yet shall the on∣ly remembrance and inwarde regard of her bewtie and ver∣tue, suffice to minister sufficient moderaciō & chiefe cōpfort during ye angry dome of my hard exile, neyther shal ye force of any enchauntment, and much lesse ye charme of any intysing perswacion, preuaile so far ouer mée, as once to make mée transgresse the leaste point of my confirmed loyaltie, where∣in as the Salemandre lyues in the flame, so wyll I pyne away and consume by péecemeale in the passion of true loue, til the angrye fates, ceassinge to wreake their malice vpon me, do place me in the possession of the due méede of my merit. Here this olde enchauntresse vnderstandinge the circum∣stance and full of his disease, and that his harte was so tho∣rowlie lymed with the bewtie of his Ladie at MILLAN, that it denied thimpression of her offer, wherein albeit there ap∣pered an ympossibilitie to wythdrawe, or at leaste to procure moderacion to the vehemencie of his affection, yet beinge no lesse loath to take a foyle in her enterprise, then desyerous to performe her charg to thuttermost, wyth intente to retor¦ne the messeger of absolute cōtentmēt, or vndowted dispair, thoughte not to leaue hym till shee hadde Syfted and tryed euery synowe and vaine of his disposicion, and hauinge but
one pece of retoricke remayninge, shée boolked it out vn∣der a couertely kinde of reprehending his folie in this forte, are you one of that vaine crue (saith she) & archfooles of the world, that striuing to bende ye bow of loyal louers, do make a glorie of a thing as requisite in loue, as cowardnes or wāte of courage in the soldiour meinteining skirmish against the Constancie. enemie? do not you thinke that a woman of indifferent iud∣gement will not rather laughe at such foyle in her seruant, then allowe his fonde constancie begon without reason, and kepte with so small discrecion. And albeit it is glorye of a Ladye to be onely embraced and dearly beloued, & that they haue (as it were by a speciall instinct of nature) a desyer a∣boue all creatures to be the only possessours of the hartes of their louers, do you not thinke for all that, that they giue not leaue and libertye to theyr seruantes to make a seconde choyce or chaunge of mistres, to thende they maye be tho∣rowly resolued of the loyaltie of their seruante, and he dis∣cerne the true difference betwene the affections of bothe his Ladies. And sewer that hart is wroughte of strange mettal, and the sprite of slender capacitie, that being bounde (as it were) to a taske, is subiect only to one simple desyer, with∣out power to bestow his regardes in more places then one, admit constancie to be as greate a vertue as you make it, & that the faith in loue is to be kepte withoute violacion, I praye you in asking you one question by frendshipp, let me be aunswered by the veray touch and reaport of your con∣science, what assurance haue you of equalitye or semblable affection at the handes of your mistrys of Myllan, whome you haue more reason to doubte, then cause to beleue? Do you thinke that you are only beloued, or that beinge pu∣nished by exile, without greate hope eftesones to recouer you, she can continue as faythfull for her parte, as you seame foolishe in beinge the slaue and subiect of an ymage or shadowe of a thynge so farre hence? no, no, do awaye theis toyes of small substance, and let my experience Sei∣gneur Cornelyo prescribe you one chief and generall rule, that
no woman beinge once disposed to loue, and hauynge the obiect of her fancie taken out of her presence, is so hable to represse the humour of desyer, or correct thinstigacion of her appetit, as it is eyther in her power to disclaime at her pleasure, or degenerat from that wherin she hath a facilitie by nature: But as one spoiled of all resistance & arguments of vertue, she ceasseth not to followe the queste of her li∣cencious inclinacion, till she haue founde a freshe supplie to enter the lystes, and paye tharrerages of hym that first con∣quered the place. Women be neither equall wyth saintes nor like vnto angels, neyther are they made of other mettal then suche as is distilled of thimperfections of your selues, and in place of priuiledge or frée dispence from the passions VVomen deri¦ued of the im¦perfections of men. of loue, I affirme theim to excede all other creatures in the vehemencye of that impression, and chieflye where the effect, doth not followe thassurance of the worde: for as the drawinge glaunces of the eye, and pleasaunt platt of the tongue, is rather an earnest penny of ye bargaine, then a ful consommacion of thaggrement, so the hungrye appetit of the hart affected, is neuer satisfyed to his contentement, till he haue tasted of the delicate frute growynge in the middest of thorcharde and paradise of loue, whiche onely concludes and knyttes vp the reste of thimperfect bargain: wherein as I must confesse vnto you, that both the lawe of loyaltye is to be obserued, and faith kepte inuyolable, where we fynde an vnitie of affection, and full effect of our desyer Faith to be obserued∣vvhere the de¦syer is perfor¦med. so to bestowe loue in the ayre, and lyue without hope of the thing that is wished, I accompte, it rather the part of a mad∣man, then office of one that hath his wittes at cōmaūdemēt, nether doth the end of suche pynyng cōceites importe other cōsequence, then a loathsom wearines and vnnatural hate of lyf, with continuall exspectation to dye, and an euerlastinge remembrance of his follye after hys death. And for your parte, comparynge the SYMPTOMES of your present pas∣sion, with thunlikelihod I sée to haue spedie ende of youre
martirdom, you bringe in remembraunce the miserable state of ye simple sparowhake, who being hooded to take away her wildnes, syttes al ye day longe beckinge vpon her Iesses and whettinge her beake vppon the pearche, rather in dis∣paire then certein of the comming of her keper: let me pearce that harde harte of yours with perswacions of reason, and seame not so rashe in refusinge the goodnes of fortune, who albeit is accompted an enemy to moste menne, yet is she also frendlie to some, and ymagyn that once in the course of your lyfe, she kisseth your cheke, and holdeth her lapppe open with an offer of a good torne, whiche if you refuce, is not to be re∣claimed eftesones by any arte or pollecie, Conuert your af∣fection founded vpon such slipper substaunce, and no lesse in∣certaine of his due mede, into a ballance of equal frendshippe and harte of semblable honor and vertue, and exchange at last these languishinge conceites that tormente youre pyninge spirite, for a pleasure no lesse precious then of great merite, who is no lesse readie thē willing, & more apte to offer, then you hable to receiue, cease hensfoorthe to loue vppon credyt and crye out of the shadowe or figure of a thinge, that hathe neyther eares to heare your complainte, nor meanes to re∣leue your distresse, and thinke that the glorye of loue consis∣tes not in the simple desyer of the mynde, nor in the foolishe prouocacions of our vaine conceites, but passing further, the pleasante reward and tryumphe of that victorie, consisteth in the consommacion of the worke, wythout the whiche, loue seameth no other thinge, then a bare plat or table whervpon the painter maye drawe what propercion hee lyste. And truely as there is no manne happie in loue, nor hathe cause to vaunte of the victorye, but hée that encountrethe thob∣iecte of hys desyer, soo mee thinketh a manne shoulde not loue that hee hathe not, nor desyer the thynge that is vt∣terlye vnknowen vnto hym, I saye thus muche (Syr) be¦cause youre resolute affection towardes youre Ladye of MYLLAN seamethe rather to argue ann humor of
frenzye, then vertue in loue, and vayne opinion, then true effect, aduisynge you for ende to haue a care of your selfe and speciall regarde to this laste request of myne, that is, in leauyng the shryne to honor the sainct, and to cloase your mouthe from gapinge after that you can not get, as the vu∣quiet dogge in the night that barketh at the shadowe of the Moone. The Oration of this bawde semed suche Musicke to the ea∣res and mynde of CORNBLIO, that he rather wished a con∣tinuance of her iargon, then an abridgement of her tale, but seynge she gaue ende to her owne discourse, with exspectatiō to heare hys replye, he dysmissed her with this shorte aun∣swere: albeit your present repeticion of thabuse in loue (sea∣minge in some respect to bee assisted bothe with rayson and Iustice) dothe discouer diuerse faltes in sondrye women, Cornelio gi∣ueth his la aunsvvere to the baude. wherof as you say the most part deliteteth asmuch to Ronne ryot and seeke a chaunge of pasture, as the other takes plea∣sure in the vertue of true constancie, yet oughte wee to vse suche an integretie betwene the good and euill, that the fal∣tes of the wicked, do not deface the renowme of theym that deserue but well, and as you saye it is harde for a manne to loue that he hathe not, so I note no lesse-rashnes in you to giue iudgement of the thinge you knowe not, but by exami∣nacion: for I am fullie perswaded, that no distance of places, nor aduersitie of times, haue power to dyminishe, and much lesse dissolue thaffection of her, whose presence I hope here∣after to enioye with no lesse pleasure, then her absence sea∣mes now to gyue me cause of annoye. And albeyt I haue not yet tasted of the frute whiche all louers do wyshe, and fewe happen to fynde, yet dare I accompte my selfe as depe∣lye in the fauor of my absent mistrys, as the best of that hap∣pye companie, and suche weakelinges as accompte no ver∣tue in loue, but in thencounter of their lasciuius desyer, and can not rest satisfied except they crop the hearbe of pleasure, are alwayes founde more liberall in wordes, then constant in loue, and more hoat in the begynnyng, then hable to con∣tinue
to the end, neyther do I see any experience to the con∣trary but that the passion whiche I suffer, ought rather too beare the true title of loue, then the surname of a simple de∣sier, seynge the delite I take in the remēbrance of her beau∣tie, is no lesse pleasure vnto me, then if I had alredie perfor∣med and tasted of the delicat effect of loue, which I am deter∣mined to attende, tyl eyther the goodnes of a better fortune restore me to my desert, or the force of death giue end to my desolacion, willing you herewith to correct your iudgemēt, and cesse to inueyghe against her, whose constancie & vertue only, defaceth the vsurped comendacion of the most of your corrupte sect: for the rest: the iustice of my cause (I hope) wil make my excuse tollerable in the opinion of her that sent you, and for your paiues I can but yelde you the choice of a thousande thankes: wherewith mother retrician tooke her leaue and retired with lesse contentemēt in her bad successe, then assured hope to preuaile in the beginning, towards her MANTVAN lady, to whom recounting eftesones ye particu∣larities of her discourse with CORNELIO she cōcluded that, he beyng limed with an other bushe, had no power to make a graūt of his good wil without a special pasport frō MILAN, where (saith she) he hath lefte both body & hart, and appereth here but in the liknes and shape of a figure with out sence or feelyng, and lesse hable to admitt the preferment of honor or proffer of raison, which albeit seamed greatly to grudge the conscience of the lady, chiefly for that she was intercepted of that which she accompted no lesse sewer, then the articles of her credear to be beleued, yet waighing ye reasons of his ex∣cuse, with ye raging ouersight of her selfe, in indifferent bal∣lance, she made of necessitie a vertue, & retired to a pacience parforce, forgetting not to punish her falt wt the pennance of repētāce, & comend to ye skies the incōperable loialty of COR∣NELIO, with no lesse gratulation on the behalf of her, yt had Plaudyna. made choice of so constant a seruant, who for her part also, al this while was in no lesse care of his weldoyng, then busily occupied in deuise how to recouer his presence, & requite the
passion of his painful torment which he chiefly desyred & iu∣stely deserued, wherein as she for her part wyshed no lesse to embrace hym, then he meritorius to possesse her, So al∣beit there passed certaine letters betwene theim seaminge rather to doble the desier of theym both, then yeld moderatiō to the passion of either of theim, yet she found the meanes to coaste the malice of her fortune with a contrarye sleyghte, by procuryng to her husbande a iorneye of xx. or xxx. dayes traueil, wherevpon she dismissed imediatly a corrior to COR¦NELIO with the reaport of ye newes in this letter folowing. Albeit (sir) calamitie of her owne nature is so quarelous, that she ceasseth not to assaile thafflicted with continual som∣monce Plaudyna ad¦uertiseth her louer of the departure of her husband. of perentorye dispaire, yet oughte we not reappose so slender assurance in the assystance of vertue, as eyther to make a marchandise of the goodnes of our fortune, & muche lesse sell the hope of future filicitie, nor yet vtterlie dis∣paire of the benefyt of time, who as she is thāeful enoughe to suche as suffer her with pacience, so hathe she presentlye entred into suche compassion of our mutuall distresse, that somonyng my husbande with a iorney of a monethes trauel in forreine affaires, she hath opened vs a most sewer meane to meete and reioyce together without daunger, wherein as all such seldome proffers of frendshypp ought to be no lesse welcome when they come, then they seame of tickle aboade whē we haue theim, so if you wish to be resolued of ye which you doute, and haue no lesse care of your owne contente∣ment, my aduise is you embrace the benefyt of so conueniēt a time, persuadyng your selfe that if you were here, I wold communicate with you more liberally, then I dare discour∣se by letter, and onelye yourselfe is of creditte, to serue as a secretorye in affaires of suche secret importance, whereof you maye conster the meaninge, without great studie, only ymagyn that fortune is not such a nigarde of her frendship, as spitefullyf her offer be refuced, & time so disdaineful, that she  tarye a moment aboue her stynte. Yours without change Plaudgna.
Yf thies newes were welcome to CORNELIO, I leaue yt to the iudgement of that amarus crewe, who seame so reso∣lute and simple in their loue, that their lyfe is onely prolon∣ged by a desyred daye, but when they see an approche of their liberty, with licence to quenche their hungry myndes, with the fode they chieflye wishe to feede vppon, god knoweth the small regarde they haue to honor, and lesse respect to the du∣tie of their conscience, and with what slender aduise and lesse time, they make the poore husbande a rampier of hornes to defend his forhead from the shott of thennemie, wherein se∣wer their delite is not so great, and glorie of so foule a con∣quest of suche comendacion, as she worthie of treble tormen∣tes, who for the glott of her fylthie desyer, and satisfyenge their founde ymportunities, dothe make no conscience to defile the mariage bedd of her husbande, take awaye the re∣nowne of her former estimaciō, deface the glorie of her aun∣cestors, and leaue besides a title of villanous reproche vp∣pon her children and posteritie, of whose reputacion shee oughte to bee more carefull, then myndefull to satisfie the greedye appetit of her owne pleasure, or folyshe pursuete of their filthie loue, and from this fountaine of execrable abuse distilleth also the sondrie sortes of vnnaturall diuisions, hap¦pening at this day between noble houses, and men of meaner discentes, the children detestynge the Father, and the father abhorringe theim whom he thinkes to bee none of his, and one brother persecutinge an other with no lesse mortality of hate, then if they were cōmon enemies of forreine contreys: for the bed being once stained, the blod mixed, and the law of mariage abused, yt muste nedes follow that the frute proce∣dynge of suche seedes, can neyther degenerate nor bee with∣out corruption, neyther can the son yelde honor or dutie to him whom nature denieth to bee his Father, wherein albeit I haue somewhat exceded the compasse of my cōmission, yet I am so persuaded of thindifferencie of those fewe Ladyes whiche fele theimselues toched with this shorte dygression, that they will not grudge with this parable of their falte,
seinge truthe marcheth vnder oure enseygne, readye to ad∣uoche and witnes the circunstance of my allegacions, which like as I inferred rather to aduise you, to eschew the lyke e∣uil, then for any derogacion of your honor, so yt maye lyke you al to excuse my reasons by thintegrety of the cause, and pardon me by iustice, retiringe now with semblable pacien∣ce to the sequeile of our CORNELIO, who construinge the wordes of the letter accordyng to the meaning of the writer, ymagined by and by thimportance of thaffaires she had too communicate with hym, wherein albeit loue moued hym on the one side to performe the desier of hys ladye, yet reason on the other part required hym to be careful of his owne saue∣tie, and not to buy a taste of his flypper pleasure with the price of his lyfe, for (saith shee) if you go to MYLLAN, and he discouered by anye of the frenche race or frendes of theyr faction, your daunger wilbe to great to escape, and you shal come to too late a repentance of your follie, wherefore bal∣lacinge indifferently betwene doute and feare, with desier to vse this occasion, leaste he myghte seame vnthankefull to the good will and requeste of his mistres, he imparted the whole circunstance to one DELIO a deare frende of hys, of whom (beyng pryuye from the begynnynge to his amarus practise) he demaunded earnestly a speciall assistance of good councell touchynge thabsolution of his present doute: thys DELIO hauing rodden alredy the whole laborinth of loue, and knewe by experience what an lne of suche follies was worthe, gaue as ryghte a iudgement of the disease of hys frende, as yf he had felte the mouynge of his polses, or tried the disposition of his water againste the son in an vrynall, wherein he failed not to discharge thoffice of a true frend in assaynge to remoue thoccasion, and mortefye the yll with thies perswations. Delyo per∣suadeth Cor¦nelyo not to go to Millan Like as sayth he small sares require slender medecins, and great greues are want to try thutter moste of the arte of Phizicke, and that the wise and experienced Phizision a∣fore he vndertake to cure the disease of hys patient, or giue
certeine iudgement of his recouerye, doth not only examine thoccasion of his greif, but makes also his firste indeuour to take awaye and mortifye the cause, afore he disclose the skil and hidden mistories of his arte, So the maladie of loue be∣ing nothing inferior to the ragyng oppressiō of the burnyng feuer, who desyereth alwayes thinges that be hurtefull, and esche weth the necessarie preseruatiues of health, is neyther to bée cured nor delte with all in any sorte, onlesse the pa∣cient wil suffer the circumstance of his disease to be Syfted to thuttermost, and abide an incisyon of the soare euen to the quicke, to thende that by thoperacion of the Cataplame whiche shalbe ministred to you, you dispayre not of recoue∣rye, althoughe there appeare diuerse lykelihodes of daun∣ger, nor I brought to aunswer for my frendshipp, whiche I proteste to be without spot of dishonest intēt. And as it is no lesse necessarie for hym that is sicke to reapose a speciall cre∣credit in his Phisicion, then the minister of medecins to bee of exquisite skyll, for that the opinion and conceite of his connynge, importes a greate consolation to the mynde of hym that is sicke, so you muste neyther denie the vertue of my medecine to worke his force, nor doubte of any thing I meane to tell you, for the tale can woorke small effects where the reaporter is of slender credit, therfore afore I Sifte you any further, I requeste you onely of one thing, as moste chief and necessarye to preuent the present peril, whiche attendes you, I meane that in chaungynge your affection, you wyll also dismisse and breake the resoluci∣on whyche I knowe youre harte hath alredye determined. The disposicion and exterior apparance of youre counte∣naunce, argue a wonderfull deuocion you haue to visitte your oracle and saint at MILLAN, whiche also I coulde well admitte, if I sawe not in the ende of that vayne pilgrymage, a harde pennance accompanied with more pe∣rils then euer happened to the son of AVCHISS, vnderta∣kynge to visitt thinfernall valleyes by the guide of his SY∣ILLA. You knowe well enough your banyshment from
MILLAN proceded of rebellion, and that your offence is so haynous in the conceite of the maiestie theare, that one∣lye the price of your heade can make the attonement and quenche the rage of his wrath: and seinge the sleighte of your enemies and malice of fortune, haue dogged you, and your doinges so nearely since your comming to Mantua, that you haue not spoken or don a thinge of suche councell, but fame hath discouered your intent, and made your aduersa∣ries partakers of your meaning, it behoueth yon to thinke that of late she is not become so wel affected towards you, as she can or will conceile this last & most perillous resolution: besides in what sorte could you disguise your selfe, that your sondrie secret markes wold not bewraye you, or what waye haue you to passe, where you are out of knowledge of al mē, & admit your owne sleight & pollecie were hable to preuayle aboue the malice of your fortune, in defending you frō the daunger of the waye, & diuerse ambushes of your enemyes, are you so persuaded of thassurāce of your Plaudina, that you wil cōmit your life & losse of honor to the fained faith of a de∣ceitefull woman, & that without a proffe of her cōstancie? Yf the miste of fonde affection doth so much dim your eyes, and gifte of present vnderstanding, that you are not hable to di∣scouer the legerdemaines of lighte womē, let my experiēce warne you to beware of the subtill sleightes & fyne Allure∣mentes of so venemous a serpent? What can you tell whe∣ther this traine she hath made, be a stale to betraye you, and committ you to the mercye of your enemye? or peraduen∣ture she hathe sente for you, because she séeth an impossibi∣litie in thenterprice, and rather to bringe you in daunger, then of intent to yelde satisfaction to your desyer. But lett vs conster her meaning to the best, with ymaginacion that her faith is without corrupcion, and that she is no lesse de∣syrous to sée you, then you (assotted vpon her beautie) seame readie to run thorow the fyer of a thousande perils, only to content her, will you by so vaine a pleasure, that is of lesse moment or abode then the thoughte of a man, at so deare
a price as the losse of your honor and lyfe. Remember that the end of that enterprise can not be good, whose begining is not founded vppon discrecion, and sequell gouerned by the rule of raison, neyther can you more greatlye deface the auncient renowme of your honor, nor leaue a greater spot of reproche to your house and frendes that liue after you, then to conclude and ende the course of your life, in the pur∣seute of so dishonest a queste, and your enemyes can not so lardgelie triumphe in your ouerthrowe and deathe, as your frendes haue cause to lament that your owne rashenes and follie were the only furtherours of the fatall bane of your lyfe: where of the contrarye parte, yf beyng cut in peces in the seruice of some noble prince, or yelde to the loare of na∣ture in som valiant exploit or enterprise of warr, you shold not only aggrauate the praise of your lyfe passed with the glorie of an honorable death, discarge your frendes and suc∣cession of al imposicions of villanous infamie, but also for∣ce your enemies to a conuersion of their malice, into a gene∣ral comendacion of your vertue and vndouted faith towar∣des your prince. Besides if you will wayghe the mortall plages threatened in the gospell to be thondered vpon tha∣dulteror, and suche as contaminat the maried mans bedd, or rightly measure the penaunce of the falte with the foulnes of the fact, you shal not only iudge with me that there is no lyfe more dampnable afore god, nor deathe more skandalus to the worlde, then to be ouerthrowne in the combat, whi∣che of ryght is due to bee parformed by an other: but also that there is more vertue and ease in sufferance, then profit or pleasure in hast, or comoditie in rashe execution. But yf the power of the fleshe, preuailynge aboue your resistance hath sturred vp this humor of hoat desier, whiche seames to presse you so far that you make no conscience to exchange your former glorie, for a title or surname of a fylthie adul∣teror, go not so far to seke your destruction, seing MANTVA presentes you with sufficiēt choice and change of releif, bet∣ter cheape and with less peril then the hazarde of reputation
or losse of lyfe. This charme of DELYO seamed so to enchante and driue reason into the waueringe mynde of the MYLLANOIS, that hee tooke respite to replie till the nexte morninge, than∣king him notwithstanding of his frendlie aduertisementes whiche (saith he) haue so vnséeled the eyes of my minde, that I fynd my selfe now hable to discerne that, whych loue wold not suffer me earste to perceiue, and muche lesse to feare or doubte: wherewith retiringe to his lodginge, hee passed the nighte in the onely contemplacion of his fancie, wherein ap∣pered suche warr and contrarietie of thoughts, with figures of hollowe conceites, that the desyer and course of slepe, was whollie conuerted into an humor of vncerteine ymagynaci∣ons, And if by chaunce his eyes offred to cloase their liddes, and sommon the reste of the partes to the quiet reapposed in sléepe, the remembrance and care of his buysynes, interup∣tinge the office of the eyes, presented eftfones a new conflict and second supplie of his passion, in such sorte, as beynge to weake to resiste the alaram, he yelded to the stronger parte, whiche was the maisterles appetit of sensualtie, and hol∣dinge more deare the pleasures of the fleshe, then the saue∣garde of his life, determined to take the forde and trye if for∣tune wolde performe asmuche as shee seamed to promise by a flatteringe hope, whych appeared in his ydle braine to em∣brace his mistres without daunger, ympartinge the nexte daye his resolucion to his deare frende DELYO, to whom saith he, because perils are commonly made greater by reap∣port, perills be grea¦ter in reaport then daunge∣rous in thad∣uenture. then found daungerous in thaduenture, and that all likelehodes seldom or neuer do happen: the valyant ought not to feare the thinge that is doubtfull nor dread the sim∣ple mouinge of a shadowe, neyther is there glorie of the victorie, but where thaduenture excedeth thexspectacion of men, wherfore I am perswaded to geue a charg of the good will of fortune, and take my iorney towardes MILLAN, to∣morow, wher if I bée sommoned wyth the writ of my desty∣nies, or malicious dome of vnhappye fortune by death,
MYLLAN will serue me aswell of a tombe, as eyther MAN∣TVA or other santuarie of the worlde, neyther can I make a better declaracion of my fayth towardes my mistres, then in defyenge the feare of so many perills, to appeare more rea∣die to obey her commaundemente, then curious or carefull of myne owne life, whyche I accompte ymploied with no lesse iustice on her behalfe, then honor to my selfe, if the same be put to extreme torments and vtterlie executed in the pla∣ce, wher the view of her own eyes may bée thindifferent iud∣ges betwene my firme constancie, and small dissymulacion, neyther can I leaue her a more precious pawne of myne in∣dissoluble loue, then beinge cut in peces in the pursewte of her seruice, to leaue the walls and posterns of her pallais, painted and all to besprent with the bloode of the most loyall seruant and frend that euer bare name to do honor or seruice to any of that noble sect. Your desperat resolucion (saith DE∣LYO) excedinge all thexperience I haue harde or redd, of any that haue bene possessed with the like infection, argueth the vnbridled humor of loue to be a kynde of rage a thousand ti∣mes more straunge and lesse reasonable, then eyther the bur∣ning feuer, or frantike maladie of suche, as are infected with the fury of frenzye, for what greater follye or rather despera∣cion can be noted in the madman, then to Ronne headlong in to the middest of the fyer, or cōmit himselfe vnarmed to the mercie of the glaues and sharp swords of his enemie? How may a mā tearme this same amarous rage, and effect of smal reason and lesse discrecion which accompanie suche as make themselues a praie to their proper sensualitie, if not some spirite or lymme of Sathan sent to torment vs, in making vs thabhomynable workemen of such miracles of mischiefe, and he that sayth that loue procedeth other wayes then of our sel∣ues, seameth rather to mocke the truth, then hable to iustefy his argument by approued authorities, seing the mischief is deriued of our selues, and norished of the corruption of our nature, whose wicked force preuaileth so much ouer the gifte of our vnderstanding and darkeneth the vertue of the spirit,
that wée are denied to se and muche lesse to treade the pathe of our dutie, honestie, or conscience. But thamarous Crew of fyuolus louers now a dayes, eyther to support their dam∣pnable enterprises with a boulster or showe of a newfounde vertue, or to set a more brauerie of their doinges, then eyther reason or conscience will allow, or rather: to make their secte fauored with a fame or name of perpetuitie, haue deuised to christen their follie by the name of sincere and true loyaltie, whiche they also forget not to confirme by the title of con∣stancie, as thoughe without the hazarde of the soule, and ab∣solute destruction of the bodie, suche execrable villenies and abuses of men, colde beare the name or be registred in ye boke of vertue, wherin albeit I cold bée assisted with infynities of examples both familiar and aunciente, yet because such dis∣course wold rather seame tedious, thē thankful to the guiltie mynds of a nomber of our contreymen, I am content to dis∣misse al antiquities, and pursewe my allegacion with thau∣thorytie of this CORNELIO who rather enchaunted then rauished with the remembrance of his Ladye, and suggestion of his own follie, tolde DELIO for ende, that if all the waies betwen MANTVA and MYLLAN were strewed or pitched with rasors, and euerye gate and windowe decked with the doble cannon readie charged to salute hym at his cominge, yet (making litle or none accompte of these mortal perils) in respect of the dutie he seamed to owe to his deare PLAVDI∣NA, he failed not to begyn to perform ye sōmonce of her letter the next morning, when with ij. seruants no lesse strange to him, then vnknowen to al men, and himself attyred in the wede of a marchāt trauellor, he departed Mantua at the open∣ing of the gates, & marching no lesse spedelie, then by secrete & vnknowē pathes, he measured his time according to thim portāce & dāger of his enterprise in such sort, as he gat wtin ye walls of Myllan at the verie last glymmer and cloasing of the euening, wher refusing ye house of his mother, because ye pro¦spect opening vpon the pallais of hys chiefeste enemye, sea∣med more apt to discouer, then hable to hyde hys being ther,
he addressed hym to a deare frende of his called Mesieur Am∣brosio, where beyng let in in the darkest of the euenyng, he was lodged in a lowe chamber, ioyned as a pendle to thut∣termost corner of the house, moste conuenient to worke his secret misterye. His first indeuor after his saffe arryual at MILLAN, was to send for an appoticarye, whose fidelitie he had earst pro∣ued in the enterchaunge and conueighe of diuerse letters betwene his Ladie and hym who not so much amazed to see hym there whom he loked not for, as glad of his comminge, for the contentement of Plaudina, assured hym of the depar∣ture of her husbande, his second diligence appeared in ther∣pedicion he vsed to aduertise his mistrys of his commynge, whom he requested by a letter vnder the conduit of this col∣carior, to appoint a conueniēt leasure, that he might speake to her in secret, for (saith he) the conference I haue to impart with you, is of other importance, then to be debated in the hearyng of witnesses, and much lesse recorded by anye then the only presence of our selues. The Lady althoughe she desired nothyng so muche as the presence of her seruant, whose only comyng seamed almoste to make her excede the bondes of reason for ioye, yet was she semblablie traunced in a passion of dreedefull conceites and doutefull feare, the one for that she feared tho malice of the frenchemen, the rather because they extended weekely a pri∣uye searche, vppon all the houses and places whyche they iudged frendes to CORNELIO, the other & chief cause of her dollor was, for that by the wronge datyng of her letter, she failed of the daye of the departure of her husbande, whereby she had not only procured to hym, a more daunger thē neded but also abused his aduenture, in beyng not hable to giue so longe a time to their pleasures as he iustelye deserued and they bothe desired, notwithstandyng she retorned the mes∣senger with a gentle aunswere, wherein aboue all other thinges, she gaue singler comendacion to his firme loyaltie, andno lesse falte toher owne follie and rashenes, whyche
because she woulde not onelye excuse, but also counteruaile or rather excede wyth a recompence to his contentation, she willed hym by ye messenger, to passe by the gate in the attire of a masquer, where the woulde attende his commynge about x. or xj. of the clocke the same euenynge, resoluynge vppon a certeine watche worde or other secret instructions whereby she might discerne hym from the reste of his fe∣lowshipp. Yt is to bée thoughte CORNELIO did neyther mislike the message, and muche lesse forgett the hower of appointmente, nor yet seame a cowarde in this chiefeste exployte of his aduenture, I am rather of opinion, that his foolishe rashenes dyd so much excede the vertue of the minde, that yf the whole garrison of the frenchemen, had bene en∣camped in the stréete, and redie to receyue hym vppon the pointe of their pickes, he woulde rather haue accepted the offer of present death, then lost so good an occasion to en∣counter a simple glaunce or glée of his greate frende, who no lesse mindefull of her promisse, then readie to performe it wyth a double diligence, in hope to enioye an interest of suche pleasure as loue yeldes to suche as fortune makes happie and hable to receiue, attended hys commynge at the place and hower of accorde. And as she was one of the best Courtiars, passinge the rest of the traine and troupe of La∣dies in beautie, behauiour and other gyftes of flatterynge showe, so was she more courted wyth the continnall haunts and companie of the Gentlemen and Princes of ITALY, then any other of what degre so euer she were, in suche sort as at the instant and present approche of her seruant, she was deuisinge familiarlye with diuerse Gentlemen of the Citie, who seing this masque noblie mounted after the spa∣nishe order make their staye afore Plaudina, & she for her part accepting their curtesye with a countenaunce more thanke∣ful then of ordinarie, iudged his embassage to the Ladye to néede neyther secret witnes nor publike audience, wherfore not ignorant in thoffice of humanitie, and because their pre∣sence shold seame no impediment to the proffit or pleasure of
an other, they toke leaue of PLAVDINA resigning the cāpp and capteine to the marchant straunger, whom yf they had knowen, they would suerlie haue rated the penny worthes of that praye at to deare a price for him to haue caried away without a gage or pawne no lesse pretious then his lyfe. Here althoughe ye fortune of CORNELIO had hlessed him, Cornelio as∣tonied in the presence of his Ladye. with doble felicitie at one instant, bothe in auoydynge the place of companie, and yelding hym large viewe of the pre∣sence of his mistreys without interupcion, yet loue seamed to sturr vp suche alteracions and diuersaty of amaze within him, that the vse of his tonge was not only taken away, and the rest of his partes, retired to a quyueryng feare, but also his eyes were so resolued in the gredy gaze of her bowtie, that in place to do her honor with any deuise or show of hys dutie by wordes, he broughte her in terror with the viewe of his dombe behauior, resembling rather the ghastly figure of ZELIO POLINO, whom the poetes fayning to be enchaū∣ted by his wyfe, do affirme that for the pennance of his of∣fence, and abuse towardes her, he is bounde vpright agaynst a wall with a gag in his mouthe, without licence or liber∣tie to speake, til she pul the pegge from betwene his Iawes, so CORNELIO albeit he was an orator sufficient enoughe, and specially in disputation of loue, yet founde he here hys tongue so punished with the pennance of POLINO, that he colde neither pleade for hymself at lardge, nor yet playe the parte of a stotting solicitor, till the longe viewe of her pro∣porcion of maiestie vnseelyng hes eyes, lent hym also a coū∣tercharme to take away the misterie of his hiddeus traunce, with comission to make a breache of his scilence, and restore Cornelio spe¦keth to his Ladye. hym to thuse and libertie of his tonge, whyche he exposed as a tryall of his newe benefit in this sort: yf all the giftes and good tornes whiche fortune euer bestowed vppon suche as receiued frendship or fauor at her hande, were here presen∣ted vnto me, with licence and libertie to chuse whych I wold haue, I doute whether I colde pike oute one of suche a nom∣ber, that were hable to counteruaile the greatnes of my pre¦sent
encounter, or if they al had power to yelde me such con∣tentement as I fynde in the contemplacion & regard of your deuine bewtye, and for your parte good madā, what greater proff can you haue of the honor and seruice with vnfayned loyaltie I haue longe vowed vnto you, then for the only res∣pect of ye dutie I owe you, to see me comitt that which is and oughte to bee most deare to al men, to the hazarde of a thou∣sande Lyfe. perilles, wherein notwithstandynge yf the god of my destynies, hath aggreed to toche me with the malice of hys dome, and publishe my sentence of death in this place, I ex∣cuse hym of present rigour, for that he hath deferred me he∣therunto, and accomptes great iustice in this fatal execuciō, seyng youre self shalbee iudge with what integretie I haue serued you, since the first vowe and mocion of my affection, whervnto PLAVDINA REPLIED, yf you thinke you so de∣pelie Plaudina re∣plieth to her seruant. in the debte of fortune, for the simple offer of so small a frendshypp, I accompte my self no lesse bounde to yelde her doble sacrafyze of semblable thākes gyuyng, not for that she hath added so greate a daunger to the declaracion of your goodwill (whereof I neuer dowted) but because in graun∣tynge vs a mutuall accesse and presence together, I maye (thoughe not so amplye as I wolde, and as you haue deser∣ued) yet in some parte, yelde you the meede of so greate a merit: yf you accompte the pleasure in deathe (happenynge in the pursute of this aduenture) peculiar to youre selfe, you doo wronge to the sincere loue and loyall affection of your deare PLAVDINA, who resolued to passe vnder the same sentence, will neyther excede you in lengthe of lyf, nor gyue you anye place in firme constancie of mynde, ney∣ther doo I greatlye feare the threates of present daunger, considerynge your auncient felicitie whyche hathe alwayes delyuered you in anye your attemptes what dyfficultie so euer appered in theim, onelye I quarrell with myne owne follye, in mystakynge the daye of the departure of mye husbande, and greue no lesse wyth thyniquitye of pre∣sente tyme, who enuyeng (as yt seames) our amarus enter∣pryse,
is readie to abridge the course of our desyered plea∣sure wyth a soddaine retourne of hym, whom I wishe with∣out Her husband eyes in thuttermost ende of thorient, notwithstandynge as the faultes proceding of rashe ouersight or ignorance, are rather excusable, then meritorious of frée pardon, so al∣thoughe I haue offended greuously, yet do I not dispaire of mercie, consideryng that besides the confession of the faulte, I yelde me to suche pennance as shall please you to enioyne me, whiche also you shall fynde me readie to performe, if at the firste hower after this midnight, you comme hether in as secret maner as you can, and strikinge but once vppon the clapper of the wicket, oure Ianiquetta (whome you know hath bene heretofore a messenger of our loue) shall open the gate, and conueighe you into a place of pleasant torments, where yf you fynde your selfe greued with anye wronge I haue don you, you may paye the reuenge with such interest as you thinke good. Wherewith albeit CORNELIO grud∣ged at the spedie retourne of ye goodman, yet conuertyng the passion of those heauy newes, into a conceit of present glad∣nes for the franke and liberall consent of his Ladye, he con∣tented hymselfe wyth the offer of hys tyme and fortune, and yeldynge a lowe reuerence to hys loftye PLAVDINA, retired in haste to his lodgynge, where attendynge the approche of his hower of appointement, wyth no lesse deuo∣cion, then the Papistes in Fraunce performe their ydola∣trous pilgrimage to theyr ydoll Sainct Tronyon vppon the mont Auyon besides Roan, or our supersticious catholikes of England of late dayes to the holye oode of Chester, or ymage of our Ladie at walsingham, he seamed to attire him∣selfe for the bed, as though he woulde not sturre out of his chamber that nyghte, by whiche semblance or dissimuled showe, he dismissed the companye that was with hym, shut∣tynge the windowes and doares of his lodgynge, tyll the deade tyme of the nyghte, sommonynge all sortes of peo∣ple to reste, seamed to putt hym in Remembraunce of hys promisse and the thynge he chiefly desyered to per∣performe,
so that, arming himself only with sleues of male, and a naked rapiour vnder his mantell, he marched towards the pallais of PLAVDINA, wyth more haste then good spéede, and lesse assuraunce of sauetye, then likelihod of good lucke: for as he accompted hymselfe no lesse frée from all daungers, then farre from any occasion or offer of perill, so fortune displayinge the flagge of her malice, encountred hym soddainely with a desaster excedynge his exspectation, whereby she warned hym (as it were) of the ambushe of fu∣ture euils whiche were readye to discouer themselues. And albeit this first accident was nothinge in respect of the other straung mischiefes, which she ceassed not to thonder vppon hym, one in the necke of an other, afore the ende of his en∣terprise, yet it oughte to haue sufficed to haue reuoked and made hym cross saile from the pursute of so bad an aduen∣ture, seinge withal there appeared neyther reason in the at∣tempt, nor honestie in the victorye. But who doubteth, that the luste of the bodye is not the chiefest thinge that infecteth the minde wyth all syn, and that the beautye of a woman dothe not onelye drawe and subdue the outwarde partes, but also leuyeth suche sharpp assaultes to the in warde forces of the mynde not sewerly rampierd in vertue, that they are not onely denyed to eschewe suche thinges as bée vndoub∣tedly hurtefull both to the bodye and soule, but also (drawen to desyer that, which they ought not to ymagine, and muche more abhorre to do as a thynge of greate detestation: be∣sides, loue is of so venterous a disposicion, sturryng vp such a corage in the hartes of those champions whome he pos∣sesseth: Loue makes a man valiant or rather fo∣lishe hardie. that he makes theim not onely vnmindefull of all daungers, but also to seame hable to passe the lymittes of the Son, wyth power to excede the bondes of Hercules and Bacchus, neyther makes he any thynge vnlawfull, whiche he thinketh reasonable, nor gyueth glorie to that enterprise, whiche is not accompanied with infynitie of perills: But as the wyse man wisheth all estates to deliberat at large afore the deuise bée put in execution, yeldyng no difference of
rewarde, with a successe of semblable and equall effecte to hym that rashely crediteth thaduise of hymselfe, and suche as committ theyr bodies and doinges to one stroake of for∣tune: So are we warned by thauthoritye of the same prin∣ciple, to examyne the circumstaunce of our enterprises, and caste the good and euil that maye happen wyth so sewer and steddye a iudgement, that there can no daunger so soone appeare, but we maye bee assisted wyth the choice of ij. or iij. remedies to represse hym, wherein if CORNELIO had bene as throwly instructed, as he seamed altogether in∣fected with the humour of follye, he neded not haue fallen into suche daunger as he doubted least, nor dispaire of that whiche he seamed to desyer moste, and muche lesse assailed euen in the begynnynge and brunt of hys buysynes wyth that soddaine feare whiche earste he was not hable to y∣magine, and nowe as vnlykely and vnprouided to shn, for as he attended the comming of Ianiqueta to open the doare, beholde there ronge in his eares a greate brute or noyse of the clatteringe of naked weapons, and men in harneys, sea∣minge (as it was in déede) a set fraye betwene ij. enemies in the ende or corner of the same stréete, which was so hoatlye pursued, that one of the skirmishers beinge hurte to the death, brake out of the presse, and fleinge towardes the place where CORNELIO stoode fainted and fell downe dead at his féete, euen as the maide opened the wicket to take hym in, whiche was not so secretlye don, but the eyes of certeine neighbours beholdynge the fraye oute of their windowes, discouered the goinge in of CORNELIO with a nacked sworde in his hande, wherevpon followed the alarame to the innocent louer as you shall heare herafter: but beinge within the courte and the gates shotte againe, he was léed by the litle Darioletta of their loue, into a garderobe or inner gallery, till the seruantes were retired to reste, who for the most parte laye out of the house that night, beinge busye in visiting the banquettes abroade, accordynge to the Epi∣cure
order of sondrye countreys in christendome durynge the season of shrtide, when diuerse glottons delite in no∣thing but to do sacrifyce to their belly: And hauing the reste An order not necessarie for a comm vvealth. sewerly locked in their chambers and all occasions of suspici∣on or feare eyther preuented or prouided for (as they thou∣ght) PLAVDINA sent for her seruant into her chamber, thin king to worke theffect of both their desyers and plante the maried mans badge in the browes of her husband being ab∣sent: But here they made their reckoning without their ost, and were forced to rise from the banquet, rather with in∣crease of appetyt, then satisfied with the delicat dishes they desyered to féede vpon: for as they had newly begon the pre∣amble to the part they ment to plaie, and entred into thama∣rous exercise of kissinge and embrasinge eche other, whereof neyther the one nor thother hadde earste made assaie together, beinge at the pointe to laye their hands to the last indeuor and effect of loue, which the frenchmanne calleth Ledon Damoreuse mercy, they hard a greate noyse and horleyborley in the stréete of the garde and chiefe officers of ye watche, who fyndynge the deade bodye at the doare of PLAVDINA, began to make such inquisition of ye murthur, wyth threatenyng charge to vnderstande the manner and cause of his deathe, that amongest the neyghbours whyche behelde the fraie, there was one affyrmed, that at the same instant that the broyle was moste hoat, hée sawe a tall yon∣ge gentleman let in at the gates of PLAVDINA, with a sworde in his hande, armed on the armes wyth sleues of male, whervpon the capteine of the watche beganne to bounce at the doare, as thoughe his force hadde bene hable to beate downe the walls, wyth suche a rowte and compa∣nye of frenchemenne assistynge hys angrye indeuor, that bothe the one and the other of oure louers sea∣med indiffrentely passioned wyth semblable feare, the one dowtyng thys soddayne sturre & proare of the frenchmen, to be rather a pryuye search to entrappe him, then an Inqui∣rendum for the murdor, wherof he was no less ignorant then
innocent, the other dispairing no lesse of the delyuery of her frende, yf he fell once vnhappelye into the handes of then∣nemye, then doubtynge the dyscouerye of her owne disho∣nestie, beynge knowen to conceile a stranger in the secret corners of her house, wherein hauyng albeit but bad choice of meanes to auoyde suche ij. threatenynge euills, and lesse tyme to take councell of their present perill, yet beyng of opynion, that in the sauetie of the one consisted the sewer∣tye of theym bothe, shee vsed the pollecie of the wyse ma∣ryner or shypmaister, who in the furye of a storme, wil not sticke to preuent the destruction of the whole, with the losse of the lesser parte, and bestowynge his wares of precius va∣lue in the sewrest comethes of his shyp, makes no consciēce in suche an extremety, to expose the reste to the mercie of thangrye waues: so knowynge that yf CORNELIO were not discouered, the matter woulde neyther growe to suspi∣cion, and muche lesse to daunger or cause of feare, she wil∣led hym to mounte into the middest of a narrowe chymney, where beynge denied scoape to sytt or to leane sometimes for his ease, the litlenes of the place gaue hym onely licence to stande vprighte vpon a barr of yron rammed with stoane and morter in bothe sydes of the chymney, where hauynge his sworde drawen in his hande, he resembled thymage of some Iupiter, holdynge a thonderbolte betwene hys fyngers readye to throwe at suche as disquietynge hys sleepe, do hunte the litle cryckettes chirpynge in the walles and cre∣uisses of the earthe, and herselfe as more hardye or rather A woman more readye of vvitt then a man in ex∣eremeties. readye of wytt in extremeties, discendes to the court, wyth all the keyes of her howsse in her hande amongest the rude watche, where after she had founde the capteine, she forgate not to fordge sondrye causes of grudge against his discurte∣sye, reprehendinge his inorderly dealynge with many was∣pishe words, but chiefly for that at so indecent an hower, and vnseamelie order, he soughte to abuse the reputacion of her husbande, in breakyng open the doares of his pallays & that in his absence, wherewith albeyt her complaint seamed to
importe a semblance of iustice, with no lesse reason on her behalfe, yet the neyghbour or firste accusor, aduowchynge eftesones his confession, forced the capteine (halfe agaynste his wil) to follow the searche, whereuppon he had the keyes deliuered, with libertie to ransecke eche corner and cabynet of the house at his pleasure, wherein he omitted neyther di∣ligence in execution, nor pollecye in the searche, for there was no coffer escaped without his bottom torned vpwarde, euerye bedd and bolster was tryed with the point of a sharpp dagger, ye no benche nor hollowe place apte to hyde a ten∣nesball was dispenced from the malice of thies rakehells of the watche. But when the frenchemen in armor came into the chamber where our CORNELIO was cammed vp in the tewell of a chymney, god knoweth whether he wished hym at Mantua with hys frende DELIO or no, & you louers that haue passed the lyke straites, maye better iudge his pas∣sion then I hable to reaport the misterie, but me thynkes I heare hym curse and Comitt to the deuil both loue & all hys practises, and beynge in continuall expectacion that some roostye halbarde shoulde bee throste vpp into the chymney where he stoode, I thynke at that instant he powred owte more prayers to god for hys deliuerie, then euer affore hee made requestes or peticions to hys Ladie to enioy her beau∣tie, neyther ys it lyke that his appetit continued, or his a∣marus humor so feruent, as hys desyer greate to be further frome the place of suche daunger: albeyt as yt is a generall rule that one euil neuer cometh alone, so this feare was not so greate, as the future pennance of harde disgestion, ney∣ther had he scarce tyme to take breathe afore he was assailed with a seconde misfortune, for vnderstandynge the watche to bee retired, and the whole guarryson of thennemies without the gates, wher vppon beyng at the point to discend from his smoaky pauillion, as one that accōpted himself past the feare of fortune, beholde the goodman alyghted at the doare, who fyndynge the streetes pestered with people in armor, hys doares open with hys house confused, and all
thinges out of order, was no lesse astonied then he had cause, and yet not so abashed at the straungenes of the thynge, as hys wyfe in doble dispair of meanes to auoyde thys seconde inconuenience, albeyt as increase of perill sturrynge vpp a freshe supplie of shyftes, pearseth the vttermoste corner of the wittes, so PLAVDINA, standyng betwene the present offer of open shame, and the malice of a most vnhappye for∣tune, was dryuen to retire to ye benefitt of that gyfte, which the Philosopher attrybutes in comon to al women, sayinge that in an extremety, the witt of a woman is so muche at cō∣maundement, that she is as sewer of a shyfte, as certaine of her lyfe, and makynge of necessetie a vertue, she vsed suche artificial sleighte in bleiring the eyes of the goodman Iohn her husband, that he allowed greately the honest diligence of hys wyfe, and blamed altogether thabuse of the capteyne, whome he threatened to requyte with semblable curtesye, wherin as she dowted nothing of the tractable nature of her simple husbande, (beyng glad notwithstandyng to haue so smothly appeased the humor of his iust anger) so she accomp∣ted her selfe, neyther free from cause of feare, nor quite deli∣uered from distresse, till she had made a meane to manifest the comming of her husbande to her louer in the chymneye, whom as she knew to be passed the feare of the frenchemē, So dowting he wold dread no further daunger, but discende ymediatly from his frozen mewe, toke her goodman by the hand and led hym from place to place where the watche had lefte al thynges oute of order, bringing hym at last into the chamber where CORNELIO stoode like a crowe in a gutter or an oracle to giue aunswer to suche as are desyerus to bee resolued of dowtefull demaundes. And albeit the vyolence of the frost, with the Nyppynge season of the wynter, had so pinched al his partes with extremety of cold, together with the passion of feare which he felte duringe his abode in hys narrow castell or cage of small ease, yt the pennance he indu∣red seamed rather to excede the haynous respect of his offēce, then a sufficient punishement for his falte, beyng only a de∣syer
and no vyolacion nor act don, yet the veraye voice of her husbande restored hym to suche treble perplexitie, that he seamed to feele thapproche and vttermost sommonce of hys fates, and passe thorowe the laste traunce and passion of life, for beynge escaped from the daunger he feared most, he sawe hymself subiect to thaudersatye he dowted leaste, wherin al∣so as the present viewe of hys seconde perill, renewed a ly∣uelye remembrance of hys daunger paste, presentyng more ympedymentes to hys delyuerye, then meanes or wayes to Necessetie geueth corage to the fainte harte. escape, So yf yt were not that necessitie geueth corage to the faint stomacke, and dispaire bryngeth often tymes a cause of good hope, I thynke (in defyenge all the delayes and dal∣lyenges of fortune) he had at that instant abridged the pur∣sute of his amarus enterprise, and naturall course of hys owne lyfe, by showynge a tomblinge caste from the topp or greeselye rooff of his grymie pallais. But PLAVDINA had doble reason in her deuise, both to aduertise her louer (as yt were in a visyon) that albeit he was bownde to too longe a deuocion, in so vnseamelye a temple, yet he shoulde not dis∣pair of the goodnes of a better fortune, and also not to seame Ialous of her indeuor and diligence in the redresse of his case, for that she colde not (without great argument of suspicion) habandon the companie of her husbande, till she had got him to bed, wherein notwithstandyng her pollecie was no lesse frustrate, and she eftesones deceiued, then the poore ymage in the chemney assailed with the malice of a third mischiefe, for her husbande beynge in bed in hys owne cabynet, com∣maūded ij. of his men that had attended him in his iorney, to lye in the chamber wher CORNELIO had passed the mistery of so many trāses, which albeit PLAVDINA resisted to thut∣termost she cold do, yet (Mauger her hart) the authority of the goodman preuailed, albeit dowting the cold villains (rydyng all day in the frost) wolde haue made a fier in the chymney, and either sacrafised the sainct that ment nothing lesse thē to become a burnt offringe, or smothered as an innocent that deserued not such purgatorye, she gaue speciall charge, not
to light so much as a candle with in the chimney: for the rest, she prayed that the god and patrone of true louers wold take such compassion of his present distresse, that if he denied him for that time the due guerdon of his rare and firme loyalty, yet at the leaste hée wolde graunte him dispence, and saffe∣conduit to passe thorow the pikes of his infortunat dangers, and as she was thus in earnest contemplacion to the maiestie of the blinde god of loue for the safe delyueryé of her frende, wyth no lesse care how to redeme him from the fylthye don∣geon of the hollowe chymney wythout the raunsom of pub∣like reproche to her selfe, and doble daunger to hym, and he also (for his parte) tyering of a patience perforce, with some hope and likelihod of good lucke notwithstandinge, for that he had alreadie escaped suche .iii. hoat skirmishes of fortune, whom he iudged now to haue drawen the thred of her spite to an ende, beholde the alaram of the iiii. assalte, more vyo∣lent then any of the rest, and excedinge theim all in absolute argumentes of perentory perills, for the iustice not satysfy∣ed of the morder, and harpinge still vppon the confession of him that first opened the presumpciō, sent hym in the garde of certeine officers to the Lord MOMBOYER, chiefe of the senat afore whō he aduowched (with new othe) the perticu∣laryties of his former deposicion, whervpon, was enioyned eftsones a straite commandement to the iustice, to make a se conde searche in the house of PLAVDINA, who if she were now more a mazed then afore, & almost at point to yeld, to dis pair, it is to be thought pore CORNELIO, had no lesse cause of disquiet, for that yeldinge himself alreadie dyscouered by his enemies, he iudged the new broyle and clattering of ros∣tye halbardes, to be messengers sente by the iudge to appre∣hende him, wherein his opinion was the rather confirmed, for that assone as they were within the house, and afore the good man colde make himselfe readie to méete theim, they made no staie till they came to the chamber of the selly hous∣doue in the chymney, wher fynding by euill happ a case with agges, and other weapons of suspicion, brought thether
by the ii. seruantes sleping in their owne misfortune, rather wearye with their longe iorneye, then likely to cōmit a morder, they condemned theim by and by, as guiltie of the fact, wherwyth omittinge no rigour of their office, they cop∣pled the ii. innocentes together in a scarffe of hemp, wherin as the goodman made hast to come to the reskew of his men, he was encountred by the way, by certeine sergeants or cry∣mynall officers, who arresting him as prysoner on the be∣halfe of the king, ledd hym captyffe to the castell amongest the rest of his miserable seruantes, neyther colde hée bée suf∣fred to commence matter for his own iustifycaciō, nor haue indifferencie in excusing thinnocency of his men, such was the rage of these Rakehells and officers of hel, who are com∣monly more prest to oppresse innocencie by vyolence, then readie to doo iustice sincerelie accordynge to theyr othe and dutie. Here although fortune began to change complexion, and moderate somwhat her angrye clymat towardes our sorow∣fullouers, by lockyng the husband wyth the moste of his ser∣uantés in close pryson, yet this happie torne of her whéele vnloked for, seamed such a myst to the mind of CORNELIO, that he was not hable to descerne that which his hart dyd dy∣uyne, nor beleue that fortune vpon such a soddaine, cold con∣uert her angrie and wrathful humor into suche spedie com∣passion, neyther cold the conceites of his doubtfull hart geue other iudgement, then that the laste retire and departure of the guarde, was rather a vision or dreame, then a thing of effect: such bée the ordynary allaroms appointed to quarell The doubte∣full mynd is rather apt to beleue the vvorste then credyt thin∣ges that b . with the doubtfull mynd, who in an extremetie, is alwai∣es more apt to ymagyn the worst, then hable to beleue or geue credyt to thinges that bée true, and when daunger and peril occupie the place, confydence is often torned into feare, and feare is of such force, that it doth not only denie vs to vse councel in our euill, but makes vs (for the moste part) to re∣fuse the thinge that should be our most sauegarde, wherein the poore CORNELIO, seamed no lesse passioned then afore,
and assailed rather with doble dispair, then hable to admit a∣ny simple proffer of hope, in such sorte as deuisinge to what sainte to vowe himselfe, he put his speciall and chiefe confi∣dence at laste in his praiers to the great God, whom he desy∣red aboue all thinges with teares to defend his deare PLAV∣DINA from any note of infamie or shame by his meanes, & for himselfe, if his glasse were now run out, and the dome of his extreme destynies colde bée no longer deferred, that at the least hée would, by the hand of some Aungell and other ver∣tue of great miracle, bestow him in some soile vnknowen, a∣fore the fates had ful power to execute the vttermost of their rigorous commission, protesting notwithstandinge, that if he might bée despensed withall for this one falt, neuer to bée found so forgetful of himselfe hereafter, if God and nature wéere content to seale him an assurance of the race and yeres of NESTOR. PLAVDINA on thother syde seamed indyffrent lye passioned betwene dissembled sorow and assured gladnes, a forced grudge and an vnfained ioye, greuinge in the one, for thimprisonement of her husband, whose innocencye shée knew dyd warrant his belyuerie, and reioysinge in the o∣ther, for that contrary to her exspectacion, fortune had made the way open and geuen her consent for the consommacion of the banquet with her languishinge louer, whose safe and happie preseruacion seamed more to delite her, thenne the remembrance of the hard and wrongful ymprisonement of her husband greued her, neyther was she so carefull to rede∣me him from captiuitye, as readie-wyth great deuocion to geue loue and fortune their peculyar thankes, the one for that in preseruing his champions from the malice of daun∣ger and marke of open shame, seamed to restore the felde, and assist theim with soccour, whenne they dispaired most of consolacion, the other, for that contrary to her nature and cus tume, she had torned theirmanifold afflictions into a pleasure more precious & acceptable, thē al ye desasters of ye whole wor∣lde seamed greuous, or hurtfull, in which passion of ioye shée mounted into the chamber of Iacke of the clockhouse, who
resembling a red heyring dryed in the smoake agaynst the be∣ginning of the next lent, attended her comming wyth no lesse deuocion then the Iews exspect their MESSIAS, and albeit, the approch of present ioye, forcinge some teares in remem∣brance of the feare passed, seamed for the time to take away ye vse and libertie of her tongue, yet she cut of ye traunce of that pleasant sorowe without thassistance of any special counter∣charme, other then that whych proceded of a vehement de∣syer to behold and speake wyth her frend in the chymney, wherfore after shée had dryed and drained the wet humor of her waterie eyes, and dismissed all argumentes of former dule, she retired to her auncient complexion of ioy, and cal∣ling with a smyling voire to him in the topp of the rooffe, willed him to discend hardly from his darke troane and thea∣trie of hell, wher (sayth she) if god had not deuised the meane of your delyuerie, and seamed willing that you shold receiue the due guerdon of your loyaltie, in consenting to commit my husband to pryson, you had stil remeined there, norished with the vapour of ye moone, longer then eyther I wold haue wished, or had bene necessarie for your health. Here albeit CORNELIO was sufficiently perswaded of the voice of his Ladie, and that he knew all the house to be voyed of suspicion or cause of further daunger, yet the remembrance of his pe∣rill passed, presented such a feare to fall eftsones into the like perplection, that hée neyther beleued that which hée hard, nor durst forsake his habytacion on highe, til he was sommo∣ned the second tyme by his PLAVDINA, who by the help of her woman, reared a lather to the top of the loft where the grymy roode stode, who being discended and in the presence of his Ladye, seamed no lesse amased, then those desolate or rather dronken creatures, who wandring the night by vn∣knowen waies, do thinke theimselues guided by the vision of some ill spirit: And the wantō ladie on thother syde, seing the ghastlie astonishement of her frend, not much vnlike in cōplexion to the chymney swepers cōminge out of the yle of
BERGAMASQVA cold not so moderat her present gladnes, but burstinge into a soddaine laughter, shée seamed to cru∣cifye the remembrance of the tragedie passed, wyth the sin∣gler contentment shée toke in beholdinge her CORNELIO, dyed (as it were) in the smotheringe tanfat of hyddeous col∣lours: And albeit (you louers) who for a simple glée and res∣pect of fauor of your Ladies, haue earste bene sprinkled, with the water of semblable affliction, and after (getting thupper hand of your fortune) possesse the presence of your dames in such oglye and deformed attire, canne best iudge of the pre∣sent case of CORNELIO, I meane whether hée hadde more cause of shame, then astonishmente, iuste anger against hys fortune, or reason to exclaime his mishappe, chieflie for that he fonnd himself so braue a companion in the lothsom badge or lyuerye of the chymneye, and whether he had so greate courage to cōmunicate wyth his PLAVDYNA, resembling the blacke knight or feryman of ZENOLOZ, as he showed hymselfe valyant, in thattempte of an enterpryse of so great aduenture, yet thauthorytie of my historye aduoucheth thus farr of his doinges at that tyme, that notwithstandinge the malice and diuersitie of all his mishapps, with the perfumed, figure and gréeselie show of himselfe, he neyther loste corage to demaunde the due méede and hyer of his daungerous tra∣ueile, nor forgat to do sacrafise to his fortune for the retorn of her frendshippe, affirminge there, that they dyd her wronge that christenned her by the name of cruell, and suche no lesse abused her, that tearmed her by the title of an vnrightuous or rigorous iudge, consideringe she doth but iustice sometime to checke or chasten our offences and we no reason to pleade for our selues but by appellacion to the pryuiledge of her fa∣uor, neyther is she cruell for euer, nor so maliciouslye bente in the begynning, but shée is hable and will vse moderacion in her angrie moode, and restore vs in the end, to treble con∣tentacion. And like wise (sayth hée) as the poore trauellour in a strange contrey, hauynge once passed diuerse light pe∣perills
and daungers of no great ymportaunce, is not only made strōger to encounter greater inconueniences, but also restored to a meruelous contentment & quiet of minde, whē wtout daunger hée may enioye his rest, and record his perills paste. Euen so fortune this night hathe geuen vs an experi∣ence of diuerse desasters, bothe to vse her aduertisemente as a speciall armour to resyste thassaltes of semblable acciden∣ts hereafter, and also to confirme our affections with a stron∣ger bonde or vndoubted vnytie, makinge the pleasures of our loue of greater price and moment after so sharp stormes of raging tempestes. And what is hée that is worthie to taste of the delites and pleasures of the worlde, that is not hable to disgeste one simple pill of bitter confection: neyther dothe hope dekaie but with the ende of life, and the vertue of a most true and inuincible loyaltie, is neuer frustrate nor voyed of his rewarde, and tochinge the stormes paste (my deare PLAV DINA) saith he, like as it is a chiefe consolacion to a man in calamytie to knowe his mishapp, so there is also a speciall compfort that followeth the remembrance of the euills whi∣che wée haue alredie suffred, and a treble contentmente be∣inge permitted to recorde theim wythout daunger, and hée that is desierous to bée crowned with the garland and glorie of victorie, must not feare the malice of perill nor hazarde of lyfe, for who contemneth death, escapeth his malice, but such as feare and flée from hym, do often fal into his daunger, nei∣ther is there lesse fame in the valyant aduenture, then in the fortunat victorie, And for my parte, if my lyfe had ended in thassalte of any of these distresses, the same had not exceded a simple oblation of my dutie towardes you, whiche also had followed wyth no lesse expedicion, then I had great desyer to geue you so vnfayned a shewe of my seruice, if in the ve∣rye act, had not appeared a manifest derogacion and cause of infamie to your honor, wherwith meaninge yet to prolonge his discourse hée was interupted with the replie of PLAVDI∣NA, who more desyerous to taste of the pleasures to come, then willinge eftsones to prefer a second view of ye mischie∣nes
passed, wished hym to dismisse the remembraunce of their former perils, and seame more willyng to embrace the gyfte of present time, for there is not so greate consolacion in the recorde of our miserie past, as cause of worthie an∣noye, if we seame vnthankefull to the newe offer or gyfte of oure fortune. And albeit (sayth she) some what smilynge, that your boldnes was more then deserued praise, yet your felicitye you sée, hath defended you from perill, and the rashnes of the valyaunt, is often times tourned into an encrese of his glorye, with double contentement not loked for wherwith embracinge her CORNELIO, she helped to dissornishe hym of his loathsom attire, and after he had pu∣rifyed his grymye bodye in ij. or iii. perfumed baines made for the purpose by the Chambriere whilest they were in dis∣course, they entred together the lystes in a faire féelde bed readye dressed, armed onely with naked weapons, where it is no lesse harde for the ignoraunt to iudge theyr encoun∣ters, then impossible for thabsent to witnes who wan the price of the battayle, onelye I leaue the sentence of them both to the resolucion of you (my Lordes) that haue or wolde bée speciall sticklors in suche a combat, but thus muche I maye ymagine without offence, that the inno∣cent hornsbye in the castell, founde not so muche plea∣sure in his prison, as CORNELIO toke delite beinge the lieutenant of his bedd, in daunsinge the maried mans rounde without other musicke then the instrument of his wyfe, which both triumphynge indiffyrentlye ouer the in∣fortunat and miserable birde in the cage, & ratinge the plea∣sures of the rest of that nighte, with an aduauntage of vij. or biii. dayes more, at what interest they thought good, forgat not to dob hym that was absent, knighte, of the forqued or∣der of Vulcā. And albeit fortune shewed heare a maruelous partialitie & cōning in the cōueigh of this buysines, I meane to aduaunce the attempte of the louer, by the oppression and vniust captiuitie of the innocent husbande, yet was not her fauor so cleare, but there appeared a threatenyng sommāce
of spedie change, for that the good man being iustifyed with in vj. or vij. dayes tryall, was redemed from pryson, whose delyuerie was not so acceptable to himself, as displeasant to his ij. corriuals, whereof the one féedyng hym wyth the re∣uercion and leauynge of an other man, gaue hym onely the possession of shapp and bodye of a woman wythout a hart. And the other wearye or cloyed with the toile of one kinde of exercise, or not hable any longer to mainteine the skir∣mishe without freshe supplies, or fearynge peraduenture the torne of his fortune, who neuer yeldes vs pleasure with∣out a sharp repentaunce in the ende, if we preuent not her dome by discrecion, was as willynge to resigne the forte, as at the first, he scanted desirous to enter the breache, wherup∣pon resoluynge vpon an other time for the further consom∣macion & complot of their felicitie, they departed, not with∣out signes of secret sorowe, appearynge by the teares stan∣ding in their eyes, the one to her husbande, who wearynge by ignorance, a forqued garland made of the leaues of the frée, wherof an other had coolled and cropped the frute, was content with that he founde, and reioysed in his happy en∣counter, the other not without great daūger retired to Man∣tua, where takynge more pleasure in the repeticion of his perils passed, then desyrous (without better aduise) to reit∣terate or vndertake againe the lyke aduenture, he discour∣sed the whole to his frende DELIO, who for his parte, reioy∣synge more in the saffe retorne of his frende, then commen∣ding his wisdom in thattempt of so rashe & perillous an en∣terprise, exclaimed against ye detestable rage & furie of loue, which as al antiquities do affirme, to be of more force & infe∣ction, then al the Ruberbe of Alexandria or antycyria is eyther hable to heale or delaie yt least furie of so vncurable a poyson, so ye familiar experiēce of this age, iustifiyng the protestaciō of former time, doth yeld vs such diuersities of exāples, tou∣ching ye raging dispositiō of that frātike humour, yt we ought not only to shon ye aire of such a pestilēt plage, no les thē the mariner, yt goth a loofe & giueth place to the harde rockes in
the daungerous Occean, but also to stande so sewerlye vpon our guarde, that we seame not once to lysten to thintisynge sommance or lewer of so execrable corrupcion, who once takynge possession of the sensible parts within vs, besides that he ceasseth not to interrupte our quiett wyth continuall torment and passion, stretcheth yet his power so farr, that he bringes vs in case not only to commit our lyues to mani∣fest perils, forgett the dutye of our conscience, with breache of the commaundement of God, but also (to satisfye the ap∣petit of wanton lubricitie) he makes vs corrupt the puritie of the soule, with the spott of abhominable adulterye, a syn most apte of all other to incense the vengeance of God againste vs, whereof we haue sewer prooff in the de∣struction of Sodom and Gomorra wyth diuerse other countreys and common welthes, whiche he hath plaged and brought to ruyne, for the onely lycencious ly∣uyng of the people. FINIS.
The argument. LIke as all ages from the firste founda∣cion of the primytiue churche, are voide of recorde, or remembrance of so greate diuersitie in religion, as the wickednes of our presente time doth presente vnto vs, So thoppynions at this daye, are not so differente one from an other, as thabuse of the babylo∣nian or dyabolicall secte of Rome, appeares so plainely in their detestable trade of liuinge, that their owne villanie and frutes of corruption, discouereth to the dymmest eyes that be, howe farr they are from the pathe of sincere and true doctrine, and yet marching vnworthelie amongeste the troope of the faithful, are not ashamed to arrogatt vn∣to theim selues the title of thanoynted of the Lorde, wyth protestacion that they only beare the badge of true chris∣tianytie. Wherin albeit, it agreeth not with the taske I haue taken in hande, eyther to axgewe or moue question, because bothe the one and the other belonges to the office of the Theologian or deuine of Learninge and authori∣tie, yet seinge a daylye encrease of their disorder, wyth a slacke endeuour of suche, as (hauinge authorytie to expose vnto theym the rodd of reformacion, seame rather per∣tiall on their behalfe, thenne readie (accordinge to their dutie) to yelde due punishment to their detestable errour, I maye without offence, bowlte out myne opynion tou∣chinge their abhominable trade of lyfe, beinge confirmed chieflie therein wyth infynite examples of lasciuious ex∣ploites and other inordinat trade of lyuinge, in the par∣sones of such, as make semblable profession, and truly as we do but righte to yelde a dutifull reuerence to such as be true prelates and pastours of the litle flocke dispersed
thorowe the worlde, together with a generall zeale to thorder of theim that bee called to the sacred sanctuarie, euenso we commit offence in myne opinion, in beleuinge that there is anye honor or commendacion at all due to theim, whose liues expose more argumentes and proues of infamie, then the moste vile and swearinge ruffyan, that euer did seruice to thimpudente curtisan of Rome, neither is it a seamlye honor or ornamente for the church of GOD, to see a prelatte, puffed vpp with vanitie, iet∣tinge vp and downe the streetes vppon his footeclothe, attended vpon as a satrapas with a traine of dashbucklers or squaringe tospottes, and hym selfe pinked and razed in thattire of a yonge bridegrome, with hys heare cur∣led by art, fallinge in lockes, as it were by appointment, vppon his forheade, with more curyositie, then an olde y∣doll or ymage of venus, perfuming the streetes with the smell of muske and amber, whiche he hath conyngely in∣closed in the seames of his garmentes, besides what exam∣ple of vertue is it, to see one of our reuerend religious fa∣thers and gouernous of couentes, more geuen to courte the dames with requestes of sensualitie, then to torne ouer the leaues of the new testament or other sacred instituci∣ons, left vnto vs by christe and his disciples, and emploie more studie in deuise to seduce and subborne their neigh∣bors wiues and doughters, then to visit their diocesse, and defende the sely shepe against the malice of the raueninge wolfe, seking to deuoure the few that be left. Is he worthy to be admitted to feede the flocke, or beare the title of chri∣stes shepherd, that lyues in more adultery, fornycation and dronkenes, then he that makes an only profession of suche euil all the daies of his life? or how is he hable to reclaime such as be out of the waye to saluacion, that detesteth the
scripture, delites in wickednes, and preferres absolute ex∣amples of the most perentory synne that can bee, whereof thytalyan bandell, hath drawen a moste true and lyuelye pattorne in the person of a neapolitaine Abbott, whyche I haue accompted of necessitie to prefer amongest my vo∣lume of discourses, as well to the confucion of hym selfe, and such as resemble him in condicion, as to geue worthie glorie to the vertue of a pure virgyn, who had her ho∣nor in such reputacion, that she sought rather to end her dayes in the defence of her chastetie, thenne to commit the vse of her bodie, to the fleshly will of an Abbot, more full of villanie, thenne per∣ticipatinge with thos∣fice and dutie of a true chri∣stian
THE VILLENNIE OF an abbot in sekinge to seduce a mayde by force and her vertue in defendyng her honor against him and his companyons of traison. ALl men, whose experience by trauaile is a wytnes of the singularities of Italye, and spaine, are of opinion I am sewer, that NAPLES, is one of ye most riche pleasante and Populus cities in EVROPE, bothe for the beautie and fartilitie of the countreye rounde a∣boute, the magnifical plat and scitua∣cion of the towne, prospectinge with open casementes, vppon the heyghte of the highe sea Tyrenū, A discrip ciō of Naples ac¦cordig to the cronicles of tuskan. and also the warlyke garrison of gentlemen of al contreis, lyenge there for the defence of the frontiers, with the ciuill disposicion of the people inhabitynge the sayde paradise. There maye you see a plaine and pleasante champaine, yel∣dynge a wonderfull solace wyth her delicate aire breathing Diuerse eng¦lishe gentle∣men entertei¦ned there at this daye. vppon suche as vse the feildes for wholsome recreacion, and noresheth besides all chases of delite necessarie for thexercise of nobilitie. And he that wysheth to be priuie to the plea∣sure of solitarie places, maye see there the wonderfull arte and industrie of nature, declared in the conueigh of litle hil∣les or pendells of the earthe, hangynge (as it were) by a frame of Geometrye, beawtified on all partes, with an in∣finitie of orenges, lemons, and other trees odiferous, yel∣dynge a comoditie and pleasure peculiar to the Towne, and generall benefitt to the whole countrey and straungers pas∣synge that waye, aswell by thintisinge sauour of that trees,
as sugred taste of the frute. The bottoms of which deliteful groues, do discouer certeine valleis no lesse ryche in frute∣ful graftes and plantes of straung kindes, then the chāpion yeldynge a plentiful increase of corne of al sortes, where the meadowe also cladd with his grene garmente at all tymes of the yere, is honge continuallie with a tapestrie of all coo∣lors of hearbes and flowers, wc other liuerie of dame flora, who assystes this heauenly glée in the valleys, with the ioy∣stes of sondrie cleare springes, yeldynge at all tymes of the daye, a temperat dewe, to take awaie the vehement heate of the son, in suche sorte, as the straungers passinge by, impar∣ting of the ayre and wholsomnes of the place by the breathe of a milde zephir, are drawen thether by delite, and forced to repose and refreshe their weary bodyes for a tyme with the solace, whereof those places yelde an indifferent plentie to al men, besides, he that is desierus to be pertaker of the mer∣ueiles of nature, hidden in thintralles of the earthe, let hym take a boate and visit the Ylandes, where amōgest the won∣ders that Pozzollo bringes furthe, he shall see the hott pod∣dells, from whence distille the baines so necessarie for the health of man, with the pubbling troughe or caue of Sibilla, by the which as the poetes fayne, ENEAS made his entrey in discendyng into hell to speake with his father. There appe∣res also a remembrance of thartificial laborynth of Dedalus, with the sumpteous pallays of the Romaine Lucullus, whose lodgyngs, with so many crooked turnings & windinges eue∣ry waye, windowes, chapells and places of solitarie resorte, excedyng (accordynge to the poetes) the cōputation of man, were swallowed in a momente in the deuowrynge throate of Tyrenū, by a soddaine trembling or shakyng of the earth cōmonly called an earthequake, finally he shalbe there pre∣sented with the secret and most sure lodgings builded by na∣ture in the belly of the harde rockes, with other wonders in such infinite nomber, that onely that place yeldes pleasure sufficient to fede the eye and mynde of man, with more de∣lite then the whole remainder of Europe is hable to furnish,
wherin I am chiefly moued to note you a particular discrip∣tiō of this paradise, to thend yt as the places of solēne & soli∣tary regarde, do cōmonly mortefie in men all occasions of wanton exercise, so the planet that gouerneth those plattes of earthly pleasure pricking forward our effeminate dispo∣cition, sturreth vp the humor of Lasciuius luste with an in∣clinacion more readie to performe the fraile suggestion of the flesh, then prouide for the health of the deuyne parte of the mynde, which is the sowle, neyther is our present age so plentiful of vertue or vertuouse effectes, but the view of our auncestors liues past, giues vs sufficient cause to blushe and be ashamed, in that we are founde so weake in thymy∣acion of their exploites and exercises of vertue, wherin be∣sides an infinitie of examples procedyng of the wickednes of our time, I maye be bolde to confirme myne opinion with a familiar experience of an Abbot of Naples, whose younge discrecion, equall to the grenes of his yeres, made hym no lesse insufficient to gouerne the state of hys vocation, then vnable euerye waye, to discharge thoffyce wherein he was inuested by othe and habitt of religion, for hauyng al∣so the consente of noble race (whereof he was discended) to fauor the wilfull appetites of his vnbridled youthe, he toke more delite to assyste the exercises of nobilitie, I meane in makynge one at all manner of daunses, masques, mome∣ries, dressed for the honour of ladies with couered faces, and other recreacions of pleasure conuenient onely for the cour∣tyer, then to sitt in the chapter house vppon reformation of hys monkes, or to ymploye any parte of hys tyme in the studie of the sacred volumes of the churche, he was also ad∣mitted a necessarye compagnion to some of the gouernours and capteines there, for that he kepte an ordynarye table and free diot for gentlemen, beynge a thynge most accepta∣ble to the Spanyarde, who at hoame kepeth hym within the compasse of thyn and sober chere, and abrode is nothynge inferiour to the deuourynge Almayne, resemblynge by that meanes, the sparynge order of the nigardes of olde tyme in
their drye and hungrye banquettes, and to the sinne of thys excesses in delicate fare, he added an offence no lesse hainous and moste vnseamely for any of his callynge, deuidyng the daye into howers, and howers into ymitacion of pleasures, some tyme he was sene in the stréetes in thattire of a gallād or younge courtiour, some tyme he visited the hauntes and assemblies of ladies, courtyng suche of theym as he founde to giue moste eare to hys ydle talke, neyther respectyng the opynion that passed of his lightnes touchynge the violacion of the hollye order of hys profession, nor the dishonor he dyd to the house from whence he discendid. But gloried rather in that he colde so artificiallye performe the partes of a Phi∣lantos or flatteryng louer, then in reuelyng the misteries of the scrypture, to seame to ymitate the true simplicite of lyfe of hys vertuous predecessours in that place, wherevppon followed ymediatly a declaracion of the vile frutes of so vi∣cius a lyfe, for as Mousieur le Moyne passed one daye in great brauerye vppon hys footeclothe thorowe the fayrest stréete of Naples, exposyng a riche showe by reason of the glée of the gold smithes shoppes, he glaunsed by chaunce vppon one of the faireste women (as he thoughte) harbored at that tyme within the walles, and followynge the pursute of her beau∣tye wyth a gredye gase of hys eye, (maugre hys harte) he was forced to a soddayne staye ryghte ouer agaynste the place where shée was, whyche tyme of abode, his eyes forgat not to imploie in takyng large measure & viewe of her pro∣porcion euery waie, makinge such reaporte to the harte and rest of the interiour partes, that in one momente he became assailed with that wherin he was ignoraunt for experience, and lesse assisted with necessarie resistaunce, féelyng within him a hoat warre betwene the sencesible partes of reason, & sensuall prouocation of ye flesh, with a presente captiuitie of Loue a com∣mon enemy to the ease of man. his auncient quiet by the cōmon enemie of the ease of man, which we call properly the passion of loue, who at this first encounter, rampired hymselfe so strongely within ye inward
partes of this younge Abbott, that he onelye gouerned his thoughtes, & disposed his doinges altogether by his discreti∣on, ceassinge not to flatter his fonde humour wyth instinctes of vaine conceits, til he brought hym to ye stage to play ye last acte of the Comedie, where he receiued the due guerdon of his follye with open shame and rebuke of the multitude, and when tyme sommoned this religious fondlynge to de∣parte from the viewe of his newe mistres, he seamed in no lesse paine, then if their had bene presente incision made into his intrailes, to cut insonder the stringes where vpon hys harte is staide, or that (accordynge to the Poetes) he felte the Egle of promotheus peckinge vppon his liuer. The girle was the doughter of a goldsmith, no lesse deare to the father, then extremelye beloued of her mother, both for her beauty and promptnes of wit, and also for that in her young yeres appeared suche argumentes and signes of vertue, that she was noted the paragon and patorne of all degres of her tyme, for womāly behauiour, and nothyng inferiour to the best touching ye chast order and honest conueighe of her life, wherewith she beautifyed the meane discente of her parents, and lefte a rare example to the Ladyes of greater callynge, who thinke, their renowme sufficientlye confirmed by the height and honor of their house, without puttinge to the ac∣cion and effecte of vertue, which in dede, as it is the badge of true nobilitie, so it hath also authoritie to make noble the meanest discent that is, and truly as the vaine woman exal∣teth her selfe, like to the birdes, whose naturall lightnes con∣ueighe theim to the starres, I meane takes pleasure in the abundance of her riches, preferreth the magnificencie of her house, ymagininge her beautie to be worthie to sytt in the highest Theatrey of the world, so the wise woman is glori∣fied, only in ye gifte of sincere & pure simplicitie, wyth a won¦derfull care to kepe her name without spott, and the course of her life so vpright, that the malice of euill tounges maye haue no power to enter, and muche lesse perce with anye worthie slaunder, but nowe to our Gansaldo, and amarous
Abbot, who bathing in the lake of his follies, thought as gre∣ate ympossibilitie to retire or dismisse this firste alaram or sommonce of loue, as to comprehende all the water of thoc∣cian within a litle vrynall, neyther wold he dispose hymself to trie the force of any resistance, but determined (at what price soeuer it wer) to ymparte his passion to the girle, which he ymagined would moue in her a consent of reciprocall affection: here in the opinion of the poet is iustifyed sayinge, that louers reapose a certeintie in dreames, and proclayme a sewer victorie of thuncerteine obiect of their fancie, like as this fonde abbot being lymed with a simple looke or glaunce at vnwares, doth promise himselfe the conquest of the pray, agaynst whom he hath as yet vsed, neyther force nor pollicye and much lesse dressed any ambushe, he forgat not euery day in the weke to make his purmenado on horsebacke in the stréet, wher dwelt the saint to whom he had vowed such sole∣mne deuocion, wherin for a more glorie of him selfe, and the rather to seduce the maide, hée appeared in seueral attire and chaung of horse twise or thrise a day, not forgettinge in pas∣sing by the house of the goldsmith, to take measure of the doare, glaunce vpon the windowes, and perce with the dra∣wig regards of his eye thorow euery creuise of ye wal, to thēd hée myght encownter a seconde view of her, whose fyrst re∣garde, had ministred vnto him the brothe of infection, and if fortune were content at any time to geue him a syght of her, whether it were at the doare or out of the window, or in other place which denied him fauor or libertie to speake to her, I thinke he forgat not to expose arguments of his grefe, by the pitiful regards of his countenance, wanton torninge of the eye, and other messengers of his passion, arguing the torment he endewred for the desier he had to do her seruice, he vnderstode at last by secret inquisition, what churche her mother haunted for the performing of her prayers, and that her doughter was her only companion in these deuocions, whither also hée directed his pilgrymage, and dissymulinge with GOD, hée plaide thypocrite, in conuertinge his re∣gardes
from thalter or place of leuacion, to beholde the bew∣tie of the goldsmithes daughter, the saint to whom his hart yelded most honor, making of the house of prayer ye shop or forge to frame iniquitie, exceding in this respect, the barba∣rouse abuse of the Etheniques turkes and infidells, who geue more reuerence to their Mosques, wher God is blasepheimed and his Son abiured, then the christians now a dayes to the temples and houses dedicated to the Lord, to performe the ministracion of the sacraments, with open publicacion of the wil of our sauiour Christ, whom wyth saint Paule we ought to pray, for the subuercion of babilon, and restauracion of the true Church, dispersed into diuers corners of the world, by the malice of the pope and his wicked disciples, wherof this Abbot, being not the least in authoritie, was nothing inferi∣our to the most abhominable in al vices, wherof he gaue suf∣ficiente proofe in two offences of equall detestacion, the one in seking to deflowre a mayde, contrarye to the othe of hys religion, the other in abusinge the house of GOD as a place of bawdye practise, to performe theffecte of hys cursed deuise, beinge more deuowte in courtinge the La∣dies of NAPLES, thenne curious to reforme thabuses of his idle couente. But the girle notinge thinconstant order of prayer in our reuerende father GONSALDO, to gether wyth hys wanton regardes full of lasciueous de∣syer, ymagined by and by, wyth what yron the gentlemanne was shod, and to what sainct hée would gladlye offer his candell, wherefore thinkinge it noo breache of good manner to playe mockhallyday wyth such a maister foole, gaue hym skoape now and thenne to hehold her at large, and to beat the hammer more depe into his head, would requite his a∣marous glaunce wyth a semblable glée, and sodaynly re∣tire and vanish out of hys sight wyth an angry farewel, as thoughe shée disdayned his wanton offer, wyth intente notwythstandynge to shonne hys voyce and place of pre∣sence no lesse, then thincounter of any venemus beaste,
fearinge to reapose eyther credytt in hys honestie, or so muche assurance in her owne pudicitie, as to open her eare to the charme of a friuolous louer, or who thinkes it no of∣fence to take awaye the puritie of a mayde, whom wée may compare to the red rose, desiered of enery one so longe, as the morning dewe mainteineth hym, in odyferous smell and pleasaunt coollor, but when the force and heate of the son hath mortyfied hys oryent hew, and conuerted hys na∣turall freshnes into a withered leafe: the desier to haue it dekaieth wyth the bewtye of the thynge, euenso shée that hathe once morgaged the flower of her virginitie, is not only dispised of hym to whom shée hath béene so prodigal of that whych shée oughte to make a moste precious Ie∣well, but also in common contempte wyth all men, what showe of dissembled courtesie soeuer they presente vnto her, wherof the mistres of GONSALDO was nothing vnmind∣full, who preferringe the honor and reputacion of chaste∣tie, affore all the respecttes of the worlde, seing wythall that the blinde Abbot pursewed more and more his amarous quest, preuented hys expedicion, by making her a straunger to his presence, shonnynge all places of hys repaire, and to take awaye all occasions that myghte geue increase to his desyer, shée forbare to visit the churches, onelesse it were at suche howers as they were voyde of other companie, and yet wyth suche regarde, that shée made (as it were) a priuy searche in all the corners and quyers of the temple, to preuent his subteltie in dressinge some ambushe to in∣uade her vppon a soddaine, and if by chaunce hée saw her and saluted her in the stréetes, shee crossed saite on the other side, and closed her eyes, as agaynst some hurtfull encown∣ter, yelding hym no other countenance then she mighte haue auowched to the most infydell in the vttermost Ilandes of Tartaria whych brought the sely freare into suche mortall perplexitie, that dispaire beganne to appeare, wyth thap∣proche of sondrye perentorie diseases, chiefly for yt the hyer of his earnest loue was retorned with sondry sorts of crueltye
and disdainefull repulses, occupyinge his brayne with suche contrarietie of thoughtes, that he was voide of councell to what saint to vow himselfe, or vpon what wood to make his arrowes, seinge he was neither hable to mortifye nor vse moderacion in his passion, and muche lesse was assisted with any meane to communicate the greatnes of his gréefe to her, whose beautie had made hym the slaue of follie, wherein albeit he sawe a vanitie to vse the office of a Dariolleta or bawde, for that the vertue of the maide argued a detestation of suche Embassadors, and to write to her appeared a great difficultie, for that she was alwayes in the presence of her mother, who vsinge the vertue of her doughter as a solace of her olde yeres, was no lesse carefull of her honestie, then be longed to so precious a Iewell, yet felinge a continuall aggrauation of desyer, wyth a flatterynge offer of loue to re∣warde hym in the ende, with the praye of his purseute: he de∣termined to suborne a shameles messenger to bewraye his shameful intente, and therefore put his requeste vpon tear∣mes in a letter of this effecte. Yf my destenies had don exe∣cution The Abbot vvriteth to his mistres. vppon my bodie, when firste they brought me to the viewe of your beautie, I had not ben a presente experience of your crueltye, nor you thoccasion of my vnworthie tor∣ment, for if death by nature, had preuented the begynnynge of my loue, I had ben frée from the force of passion, dischar∣ged of all mortall greefe, and you dispensed with al, from the imputation & cause of a double ill, the one to abuse the ver∣tue of your selfe, & do wronge to the renowme of al women by preferring effectes of rigour, the other in disdaynyng the seruice of him, whose life and death payseth indifferentlye in the ballaunce of your good will, dissemblynge also not to sée the circunstaunce of my loue, to driue me to desperacion, and at the point to vse vnnaturall force againste my selfe? Howe often alas, haue I made you priuye to thinwarde af∣fection of my mynde, by the outwarde regardes & glaunces of my exterior partes? Howe often haue you acknowledged the same by argument of semblable glée, and immediatly
denied the whole by a soddaine showe of angrie complexion, eyther disdayning vtterly thoffer of my seruice, as one vn∣worthie to enioye the preferment of your fauor, or dalyenge wyth my earnest sute, to geue increase to my passion. I haue often bene vpon the waye to disclose vnto you by mouth, the thinge wherin your hart hath alreadie geuen iudgmente of my meaning, albeit the desier not to offende you any waye hath staide thexpedicion of my intent, suspendyng my grefe, till the greatnes of the same hath forced a presente vente wt this simple requeste, that as, fearinge to ymparte the full of so great a matter to so vncerteine a messenger as a pece of paper, so it may please you to geue me credit of cōferēce, wher only our selues may be witnesses of that whych I haue to discouer & am no longer hable to conceile, wherin if ther be any bonde of consideracion in great Ladyes, on the behalf of the offer of their inferiours, ymagin how iustly I deserue well of you, and wyth what reason you oughte to passe a graunte of so small a fauor to hym, who is no lesse hable (as you know) to procure your aduancement wyth what porcion of wealthe your selfe shall thinke good, then readye to per∣forme all such thinges as you shall but ymagyn and wishe to be don, wherof I sende you a confirmacion herewith, sea∣led with the othe of my religion, and with protestacion of the faythe and life of your moste loyall and desolate seruante. GONSALDO He had no soner written this letter, but he was in mynde eftsones to commit it into morsells, or to make it a sacrafice in the fyer, dispairing belike of the successe, till at laste the blind, guide and fyrst author of his follie reprehendinge his want of corage, renforced hym to a forwardnes, perswading Loue. hym that the beginning was good and argued a sequeile of contentacion, the rather saieth, he for that the tender yeres wyth small discrecion preferreth an ignorance in the girle of your meaning, & seing accesse and conference be denied, yt next pollicie is to vse thaduantage of writinge whyche de∣clareth theffect of that whyche is painted in the outwarde
regardes of the face, the wordes of your letter may also im∣porte such a charme, that her present rigour may be conuer∣ted into spedie cōpassion, for as there is conning in enchaū∣tyng, so the misterie can not be wrought without the assi∣staunce of words, which foolishe suggestion restored the Ab∣bot to a hope, & makyng conscience to committ the conueigh to the creditt of anye of his couent, for that he doubted their wisdome in performinge so secret an embassage, vsed thex∣pedicion by one of the vallettes of his chamber, whom after he had put in remembraunce, of thauncient fauours he had vsed on his behalfe, and howe much he reaposed for hymself in the assurance of his fidelitie, he said he was nowe to im∣ploye his fayth and diligence in a busynes of no lesse value, then the price of his life, wherin sayeth he, albeit thou maiest conster some part of my meaning by the circūstaunce of the late chaunge and alteraciō thou haste noted in me, iudgyng peraduenture the same to procede of some amarous hu∣mour, yet, althoughe I consente and make good the con∣ceite of thy fancie in that surmise, thow nor all the de∣uinours of the worlde can name her, who (as thou séest hath made me the flaue of her beautie, this is the secret wher∣in I am to make a last experience of thy indeuour and wise∣dome, to make a presente of theis letterrs to her, who hath not yet vouchesaffed to lende me the vse of one simple re∣garde of fauor, to qualifye the heate of my burnynge mar∣tyrdom, wherewith he told him the name of his mistres, the stréete and signe wher her father dwelte, with straite com∣maundement in the ende, not to omitt any moment or offer of time that might seame to further ye executiō of his charge: the vallet glad to haue so good a meane to make declaration of his loyal zeale towardes his maister, admitted the enter∣pryse & gaue hym assurāce of his diligence, willyng him in ye meane while not to loase corage, for that saith he there is no fortresse so wel defended, but at length it is rendred by com∣posicion, or won by assaulte, wherewith the Abbott departed to his chamber flatteringe himselfe with the promise of his
man, who destrous to reliue the distres of his maister, added such diligēce to the dispache of his commission that the nexte daie he foūde the meanes to accoste Parolyna occupyed al alon in her meditacions in the churche, where presenting himself afore her with more assurāce, then the passioned Abbot, gaue her the reuerence of his Countrey, & desiered her not to dis∣may, if vpon so small acquaintance, he discharged so boldlye the parte of a familiar messenger, wherein sayeth he, if there be offence I preferr (good madam) for my excuse my lord and maister, vpon whose behalfe he craued so muche fauour as to reade his letter, which after he had kissed wit great humi∣litye, offred to the chaste mayde, who knowyng the messen∣ger, for that she had séen hym often follow the traine of Gon∣saldo, gaue iudgement also of the cause of his commynge, wherefore she did not only refuse it, but also wyth certeine tearmes of reproche, retourned hym with an answer cōtra∣rie to thexspectation of hym selfe, and contentment of hym that sent hym, what sayeth she, doth your maister accompte me of such simplicitie, that I haue not longe since discerned thintēt of his follie? doth he thinke that I am any other then one that settes as deare a price of mine honor, as the best la∣die in Italy? or is he of opiniō that the respect of his authoritie or greatnes in degrée can force me ye rather to a remorce on the behalf of his wicked meaning, no, no, tel him I haue nei∣ther to do with hym, & lesse cause to accepte his letters, ney∣ther oughte he to adresse suche embassages to me, who can, nor will not be thankefull to any in loue, but such as my pa∣rentes shall giue me in lawful mariage, is this his masque of holynes, to couer so greate a villanie vnder the habit or shroude of simplicitie? what argument of vertue is this in him, whose office is to prescribe principles of honest lyfe? can he discharge the othe of his religiō, in seking to corrupt the puritie of virgins, and expose an example of the greatest villanie that is? Let hym besiege the forte, that is as gladde to yelde, as he readie to sommon, and bestowe his charmes and letters vppon those, whose regarde and care of honor,
is equall to the malice of his meaning, and for your part let it suffice you that I pardon your first follie, and ceasse hens∣furthe to procede any further, least you be payde with the monie ordeyned to discharge the hyer of suche messengers, wherewith she flonge oute of the churche and not without some passion of iuste anger, repaired to her fathers house, not ympartynge anye parte of thaccident to any one of her parentes, trustynge that as her desier and intente was to liue in the trade of an honest woman, so God woulde assiste her vertuous respecte and defende her chastetie agaynst the malice of the wycked, she douted to discouer the case to her mother, for feare some slaunder woulde haue followed, neyther durste she imparte it to tholdeman, leaste in com∣plainynge of the wronge, hys pouertie hadde béene founde to weake to contende agaynste thautoritie of thabbot, and by that meanes to haue beene worse delte with all then ey∣ther he deserued, or she desiered, but leauing in example to al women to vse like modestie in semblable distresses, shee committed her selfe and cause to the protection of the hea∣uens. By this time the valiant messenger of GONSALDO was retorned to his maister, communicatinge not onelye the perticularities of her aūswere, the disdaine she showed to his letters, and small accompte shee seamed to make of the offer of his good wil, but also perswaded him to correct the humor of his appetite, & dismisse the remēbrance of her beautie, bestowinge his affection vppon some such as hatbe more discrecion to yelde hym consideration, then the folish doughter of a simple artisan, which reaport, albeit brought an increase of doble passion to the martiredom of the poore Abbot, bothe for that the termes of her aunswere argued an agrauacion of her creweltie, and absolute dispaire hereafter to enioy ye benefit of her good wil, yet he had ye gift to dissimu le thinward panges of his grefe wt a wonderfull patience, conuerting his humor of fretting mallencolie into tearmes Thexclama∣cion of the Abbot. of sorowful exclamacion in this sorte, ah saith he, I see wel ye arte ignorāt in ye forces of loue, who is not easely suplanted
after he hath once conquered the rampier of the harte, ney∣ther arte thou priuie to the operacion of his pilles, who dif∣ferynge from the nature of other passions assailynge the mynde of man, doe make vs desyer that we can not gett, and loue the thynges whiche hates vs mortallye, and is not this a sufficieut experience of the peruersitie of wo∣men, seinge the more I indeuour to preferr my seruice to my cruell Parolyna, the lesse accompte she makes of myne offer, and the more I languishe in desyer, the greater plea∣sure takes she in my martiredome, that I wishe alas, that some oyle of holye thombe, might presently close mine eyes againste the lighte of this world, or els the vertue of some happie enchauntment distillinge from the arbour and pot of som Elysea, mighte with spede remoue the vaile of her rigour, and sturr vp an humor of compassion to the reliefe of my painefull tormente: I see thy aduise is iustified eue∣ry waye by reason, & when I dispose my selfe to followe thy councel, I féele within me (I know not what) which forceth my wil wyth constrainte to purseue the sommance of mine appetite, in suche sorte that the voice whiche vttered the re∣pulse, hath also pronounced the fatall sentence of my lyfe, wherin he had yet proceded, but that the panges of inwarde sorowe compellynge the conduites of waterye humours to discouer theim selues, forced a vente at his eyes in greate a∣bundance of teares, whiche drownyng the wordes of furder discourse in his mouth, moued his vallet also to equal dolor, who notwithstandynge preferred suche consolacion to his maister as sorowe woulde giue hym leaue to vtter, with a franke offer to pawne his lyfe with the rest of his worldlye porcion, to redeme the quiete of the Abbott, and put hym in possession of her whome he accompted the sufferayne CATAPLAME for his mortall disease, wherewith he con∣forted eftesones the selye GONSALDO, who tellynge hym that after he had gott the consent of conuenient tyme and oportunitie, he woulde somon hym to an effect of his pro∣misse,
dismissinge therewith his faithfull seruant, and retirynge hymselfe to a simple comforte in this laste reso∣luciō, for certeine dayes forbare to visit the streets, churches or other places, where afore he was wonte to make his of∣feryngs and purmenadoes, thinkynge in shonnyng the pla∣ces of her repaire and presence, he shoulde at laste force a forgetfulnes of her beautie, wherein notwithstandynge he seamed to sprinkle water vppon hoatte cinders, and brought more oyle to his matche, and all hys traueile ther∣in sturred vpp a freshe supplie of drawing baites, mouinge an encrease of desyer, wyth augmentacion of his follye, whiche after he assaide to putt in execution, for the more he wente about to roote out the remembrance of her beautye, the more suerlye dyd loue imprinte her picture in the bot∣tome of his harte, with prouocation not to giue ouer the queste, but procede in the pursute of so pleasant a praye, in the daye the whole cloisture or circute of his abbaye cold skarcelye comprehende the sondrie ymaginations of hys braine, and his bed in the nighte presented hym wyth as∣muche reste, as he that is bounde to treade continually the laborinth of endles toile, wherin rauynge thus in a pas∣sion of contrarietye of thoughtes, he accused hym selfe of cowardnes, for that the offer of so fainte a resistance, made hym retire his force, without gyuyng a more oate assaulte to the place he ment to conquere, wherewith, remembring howe often he had harde, that women (what desyer so euer they haue of theim selues to be thankeful to him that courts theim with the offer of loue, yet take they notwythstan∣dynge a singler pleasure to be assailed with importunities intermedled with a lytle constrainte or force, determi∣ned to imploye thuttermost of his forces, and to paye hym selfe (maugre her resistaunce), the hier of hys traueile wyth the moste precious Iewell or treasure she had, at suche tyme as fortune woulde gyue hym the fauour of a conuenient tyme and place, to leuy the last alaram, thyn∣kynge with the aduantage of his pollicie to compell her
to treade, the daunce which she neuer mente to practise, yf not in lawfull mariage: here you maye note a familiar experience, that he that is in loue, albeit he be blynde, tou∣chinge the knowledge of reason, yet for the deuise and exe, cution of a follye he hath more eyes, then he whome the Poetes affirme to haue an hundreth lightes for the garde of Iupiters cowe, for that this folishe Abbot attendyng daiely an offer of commoditie and aduauntage of tyme to gyue a charge vppon his plainsante enemye at vnwares, vsed su∣che diligent watch to discrye her doinges, that he was made priuie to the certeine hower wherein she was determined to attende vpon her parentes to a fearme or graunge, they had not the moste parte of a league from the Citye. In whiche oportunitye and offer of thankefull tyme the blinde Abbott reaposed a singler commoditie of his cause, for that as you haue harde he determined to inuade her wyth an ambushe at vnwares, and so rauishe her out of the handes of her pa∣rentes by mayne strengthe, whereunto he added an effecte without regarde to the slaunder whiche attended so wicked an enterprise, or thabuse he committed againste the order of his religion, and muche lesse the estimacion and honor of the house whereof he was discended. Let this experience suffice to confute the opinion of the most of our louers nowe a dayes, who makynge a God of the ydoll of loue, do not lett to giue hym place amonge the moste perfect and heroi∣call vertues that are, affirmynge that all ciuilitye and curteys behauiour amongest men, is deriued of the disci∣pline taughte in his skoole, let the effect of his rage I saye, declare his disposicion, and be the equall iudge whether he be an indifferent euill or a pertiall vice, for settynge your partycular affections aparte, I knowe you wyll confyrme myne opinion thus farre, that, he whiche you cal loue and woulde that we honor hym wyth a tytle of a God, and giue hym a power more then humaine, is no other thinge, then a brutall passion of the minde deriued of that
parte whiche nature hath made comon to vs with beastes, touchynge sensualytie, and he which laboreth in the disease of that follie, is in no other degrée, then he that is posses∣sed with the spirite of fransie and desperation, looke in the seconde booke of the kynges, and tell me what planett or spirite gouerned AMNON the son of DAVID, who doatyng vppon the beautie of hys owne sister, made no consience to deflower her and take awaye her chastetie, whiche horrible acte woulde haue procured terrour to the most mortall ene∣mye, both for the horrour and detestacion of the syn, and al∣so for the honor and reuerence which all men oughte to gy∣ue to the chastetie of a mayde. The prince of SICHEM being extremely enamored vppon the beautie of the doughter of Iacob, dyd it suffice hym onely to loue her in honeste sorte? dyd he staye hym self vppon your masqued and dyssymuled loyaltie? no, he dyd that which is iudged tollerable to you al and woulde be comon to the moste of you, yf the rigour of the lawes, had you not in awe, and preferred a feare of tor∣mentes and worthy punishmentes, he rauished her by force, wherevppon followed the ruyne of hym selfe and subuer∣cion of his people, for ende, yf there be any one amongest you that absteyneth from lyke violacion, I thynke (sewer) he is not stricken with thextremitie of loue, but that hys mynde hath tasted but of a simple impression of that follie, seynge that he that is touched to the quycke, can hardly re∣fraine frō execution of like villainies, amongest whom not∣withstanding I cōprehende not thintegretie of them, whose wills tende to do honor to the hollye bedd of mariage with∣out violacion, for that I am perswaded those affections pro∣cede frome aboue, and approued by god hym selfe, but I in∣ueigh againste their vnhoneste desiers, who respect nothing but the pleasure in that wherein Mars and Uenus stroue for the maisterie, at suche tyme as vulcan discouered theyr naked bodies, which I can not terme so properly in our vul∣gare phrase, as the frencheman includes in thies three wor∣des Le don damoureuse mercy, the delite whereof, dekayinge
with the ende of thact, maketh theym loath the thing wher∣in carste they tooke singler pleasure. Here you may see also a worthie example in this maister Abbott, who of a pastour and shepherde of the heard, becomes a deuowrer of the prin∣cipal shepe in his flocke, and leauinge thabit and attire of re∣ligion, is inuested with thaccotrementes of a villaine and dysposicion of a barbarus Lyrant, that hathe neyther knowledge of God, nor feare of hys lawes, wherein my con∣science wolde serue me to vse a further discourse touchyng thabuses in thies ypocrytes, sauynge that (God be praysed) our realme is happely purged of suche filth and replenished with a plentifull crewe of thundowted, and faithfull myni∣sters of godes worde, neyther will I troble my historie with the sondry enormities and practises of hell whyche I noted in some religius houses in fraunce duryng my being there, because my theame at this tyme, is not to treate of thabuses in their religion, neyther am I assisted with sufficient time, for that yf I should but abridge their disorders into a tenthe parte, the volume wold excede the bignes of the bible, wher∣fore it shall suffice me to desier God in my praiers to remo∣ue the vaile of their darkenes in tyme, leaste their iniquitie procure hym to thonder lyke desolation vppon theym, as he dyd vppon the children of Israell, when they forsoe hym, and bowed downe to ymages, whereof their owne handes were the carpenters, and nowe to the sequeyle of Don Gon∣saldo, who harpynge onely vppon the strynge of hys damna∣ble resolucion, imparted thenterprice to his man who (as you haue harde) engaged his faithe to be the minister of hys wil, in what respect he thoughte good to ymploye hym, and hauynge eftesonnes preferred a repeticion of his promisse wyth an assurance by othe of thuttermoste he was hable to do, thabot told him yt within few dayes his mistres went to performe a banquett with her father and mother oute of the citie, to whome sayeth he, seyinge I haue forgott no expe∣perience or importunitie whyche humanitie can deuise, and seynge that in the enioyinge of her beautie, consistes the
continuance or diminucion of my dayes I am determyned to retire to the benefit of my laste refuge, whyche is to em∣ploye thutter moste of my forces in vsynge her by mayne encownter vppon the waye betwene the towne and her fathers graunge in ye countrey, wherin as thou hast alredye assured me of thy helpe by the othe and religion of thy faith, so thou muste straine thy selfe to procure a further ayde of suche companions as thou accomptes necessarye to assiste thexpedicion, to thend that when the matter shalbe broughte to the tryall of force, we be not founde to weake in the dis∣patche of our entreprise, whyche albeit maye importe vnto the and suche as thou shalte subborne for thy companions in this case, bothe a grudge of conscience, and feare to fall into the rigour of the lawes, yet thou arte not ignorante that thauthoritie of my profession is sufficient to dispense and absolue the synne, and my power hable to preuaile a∣boue thextremitie of iustice in this or any other respecte of what importance so euer it appeare, neyther will I sticke to deffraye the whole plate and treasure of my Abbeye in defence of the quarrell agaynste the whole state and senate of NAPLES, wherwith he dismissed his manne, who with the pleasante platt of hys tounge and prodigall promisses of liberall hyer, was furnished ymediatlye of hys trayterus crewe to betraye thinnocente mayde, who for her part seing GONSALDO hadde discontynued hys mosters in the strete, and hawnte to the churche where she is wonte to performe her deuocion, thoughte he hadde also disclaymed the vehe∣mencie of his passion, with intente no more to pursue her, wherein as she accompted her self moste free frome perill, so she founde an approche and offer of daunger, whych af∣fore she was not hable to ymagyn, for that thabbott beynge aduertised by hys espiells of the daye and hower when the mayde shoulde go into the countrey, measured so ryghtlye his tyme with the momente of her departure, that some one or two howers affore, he somoneth his conspiratours and
goeth oute of the Towne not in his frears weede or attire of his profession, but disguised in suche sorte as he was not knowen to any but the ministers of his intente, whome he bestowed in ambushe in an vnknowen couerte ioynyng to the path by the whych the goldsmith and his doughter shold passe, who thynkynge vppon nothynge but the plaisante regardes whyche the freshe and grene feeldes dydd yelde and muche lesse ymagenynge anye secrett practise or vil∣lanie conspired against theim, entred with greate delite in∣to the pathe of their misfortune, for neare vnto NAPLES there ronneth a litle riuer discendynge from certaine roc∣kes giuynge necessarye moysture to the valley neare the towne, whiche the poete SANAZARO in hys ARCHADIA calleth SEBETH deuydynge her self into two armes harde vnder the walls, whereof the one fallynge into certaine pi∣pes of lead becomes seruiceable by the arte of man to thin∣habitantes of Naples, the other, stretchynge towarde the champaine, refresheth as she passeth the meadowes and cor∣nefeldes adioyninge with the dewe of her siluer streames and in the ende yeldinge tribute to the greate flude Thetys fauls with a softe noise into ye sea, who receiueth her with an embrasyng worthie for so plaisāte a neyghbour, ouer which riuer is builded a bridge passible for horse and man called Madalyne bridge, shrowded with the branches and longe spraies of certeine willowes growynge on eyther side the broke, the commoditie of whych straite with thaduauntage of the place offred theim selues (as it were) to assiste the en∣terprice of thabbot in thincoūter of his plaisant enemy, who disposed to more ioye then her weary parentes, went alwais affore theym, supplieng the time and tediousnes of their tra∣uaile, with sondrye plaisant deuises, and as the heate of the day with thexercise of her body in goinge, had sett a broche ye vaines of good blod through all her parts, wherby to ye pure cōplexion & white of her face was added an orient die of red, so her heare, of ye coollor of amber curled by nature, and fal∣linge in lockes vppon her forhead, couered as then with an
Escarsion of the fashion of pyemont, gaue suche an increase to her bewtie, that wyth the helpe of the shade and shadowe of the tres, pauisinge the vyolence of the son, wyth the glée of the pleasante, streame assistinge the naturall white and redd in her face her eyes glistering as the cleare starres in the loftie skie, made her seame nothinge inferiour to the per fection of her whom the poetes haue crowned wyth the title of a Goddesse and Quene of be wtie, wherin if this brauer ye of parolina gaue greate delite to the olde yeres of her paren∣tes, who knewe the argumentes of youthfull ioye whyche appeared in their daughter, where but recreacion & to morte∣fie in theym the wearines of the waye, it was nothinge in respect to the pleasure of GONSALDO who beholdinge the bewtie of his mistres, resemblinge a far of, one of the NIM∣PHES affirmed by Ouide to attende the goddes DIANA go∣inge on huntinge, felte in himselfe a newe increase or sup∣plie of desier, in such sorte, that if hee had but the flea in his eare afore, it is now that he standes vpon thornes, till hee haue geuen a charge vppon the praye whiche seames so ple∣sant of taste, and swearinge by the god of hys religion, not to lose the benefit of so sweate a morsell, began to encorage his men to dispose theym selues to performe the cause of theyr comming, warninge theym notwithstandinge in spe∣ciall sorte, to absteine from vyolence agaynst the mayde, and albeit sayth hée the father is vnarmed of any weapon sauinge his shorte woodknife, yet am I sewer, he will put himselfe in indeuor to reskowe his daughter, wherefore whilest some are graplinge wyth the girle, the rest maye kepe the olde man occupied wyth terror and wordes of threatening feare, wherwyth he cried to thassalte, when ymediatly thambushe discouered theym selues, and in a moment enuyroned the selly maide on al partes with theyr swordes drawen, offring to laye handes vpon her, and carie her to their maister, the miserable parentes seinge theym at pointe to departe wyth ye only pillor and proppe of their old yeres, ymagyning that∣tempte to ymport an effecte of greate mischiefe. retired to
thordinarie armes and defenses of age, which were pitifull cries which the villaines appaised ymediatly wyth threates of present death, if they would not cease their doleful brute, and for a more terror to the sellie goldsmith, some of theim helde the pointe of hys sworde to his throate, who notwith∣standing kept his daughter faste in his armes, and the mo∣ther would not bée disseuered from her childe, desieringe the traitors to discharge their crueltie vppon her and geue her daughter the fauor of a safe libertie, but the more the deso∣late parentes filled their eares with requestes of compassion the lesse pitie appered in the tyrantes, and greater desier grew in the rauynous Abbot: what harte colde refrayne to distil droppes of blode on the behalfe of the desolation of these thrée wretched creatures, the father out of breathe and halfe dead, wyth the force of skrichinge cries, the mother equall pertaker of his desaster, and exceding her husband in sorow, the maide more assured then her parentes in the conflicte of this misfortune, was at the pointe to vse force agaynste her selfe, rather then to falle into the handes of thexecucioners of her pudicitie: I am sewer neuer a Ladie of you all, reading this dollorous discourse, can abstaine from tearmes of detes∣tacion agaynst the infamous and disordered desier of this dis∣ciple of Sathan, neyther conceile thargument of compassion seinge the virginitie of this mayde hangyng by so slender a fyllet, and readie to be offred by compulcion vppon the alter of fylthye ymmolacion, to glot the lasciuious thrust of this rauynous APOSTAT, who masqued in a visorne and wede of simplicitie, supported also by a coollour of fayned deuocion, studieth nothinge, but to pray vpon the honour of widowes, abuse the absence of the maried man by corrupting hys wife, & subborn by inorderly meanes to seduce the chastetie of mai¦des. But now to our PAROLYNA who as shee knewe the cause of this Alaram to procede of her onlye, and seinge the force of thassailantes had cōmitted alreadie her parentes as it were into sewer warde of their power, and finding with all an ympossibilitie in her selfe to resiste the strenghte of
the rest, determyned yet to supplie the defence of her honor wyth the benefit of a vertuous and valyaunt pollecie, wher∣fore chaunginge in a moment the amazed glée of complexion in her face, into a regard of assured ioye, addressed her to thab bot wyth request, that afore she performed theffect of his de∣sier, he wolde lende her his sworde, for no other entent, saith she, but that my handes only may chasten the rigour of mine olde father, whose crabbed age, ignorante of ciuilitie, hathe béene hithervnto thonly ympediment and staie of my good∣will to yelde you the hier and consideracion of your loue, as∣suringe His letter. you that vpon the receite of the fyrste assurance of your affection towards me, I got the consent of my mother, to be thankefull in sorte you required mée, and nowe if hee should liue, and witnes the consomacion of both our desiers, hys contynuall complaintes wold procure greuous punish∣ment of thoffence, to the open slaunder of vs both, wherwith tholde man gyuing vndoubted credit to the dyssymuled dis∣course of hys daughter, the rather for that he noted no diffe∣rence in her countenance and famyliar conference to thab∣bot, cried out against thiniquitie she vsed to his honeste life passed, and present wrong she did to the vertue of his hoarie yeres, and not knowing the meaning or misterie of her polli¦cie, forgat no termes of reproch or rigorous rebuke against his chast doughter, of whose good will onsaldo beinge more then halfe assured, both for the small regarde she vsed, to the threatning wordes of her father, and also the flattering tear∣mes of consent by her owne mouth, no lesse glad of the victo∣rie, then if he had alreadie passed the offer of al perills, perfor∣med the request of her, who desiered nothing lesse then the death of her father, and life of thabbot, and putting his naked sworde into the hand of the coragious girle, offring withal to embrase her as though the conquest wer alreadie performed, she flonge from hym in great rage, willing him to retire, as he made accompt of his life, for sayth she, thou counterfeit ypocryte, yf thou offer eftesones to laye thy rauenouse han∣des vpon me, thyne owne sworde shall geue the blowe of
deadlye vengaunce to the fatall course of thy cursed dayes, wherupon she addressed her to her father halfe deade of a fret tinge anger, and purging hys collerike conceites agaynste her, tolde him that he was not the father of a doughter, that would not iustefie the glorie of his life passed wyth equall vertue, and much lesse further his death by thinfamous re∣nowme of her life, neyther do the thinge eyther by accorde or compulcion, that should haue power to sturr vp the blodd of shame in his face, in what companie soeuer he came, But sayth shée, the mightie hande of God restoringe thy weake age to a doble strength, and me to a perfecte skill in the vse of this sword which I haue conqwered of our common enemy, shal defende our honor agaynste the force of these Rakehells, who seke to depriue me of the Jewell of my reputaciō, wher∣with she florished here and there, bestowing her blowes with such skill to the disauantage of her enemye, that who hadde sene her desperat dealing wyth the sworde, would haue iud∣ged, that shée had bene traded in the only exercise of armes all the dayes of her life, whiche stroke such soddaine corage and ioye into the dead hart of her olde father, that he aduow∣ed his life in the honest quarell of his doughters chastetie, & likewise the careful mother gaue assistance to the magna∣minitie of her childe accordinge to her feble force, whyche so occupied the place for a tyme, that tholde man and the two ympes deriued of the blodd of thancient AMAZONS, laide so harde to the charge of the monke and his souldiours, that in one instant the whole ambush of traitors was out of brea¦the. But GONSALDO knowyng by this laste deceite of the maide that there was neither loue nor frendly meanynge in her, began to conuert his affection into an humor of fury, commaundinge the sword to bee taken out of the handes of the new champian, wyth expresse charge notwithstanding to vse no violence agaynst her, wherwyth the medley grewe ymediatlye soo hoate on bothe sides, that the Father to defende the honor of hys daughter, vsed no care to his owne sauegard: and the daughter to preuent the violence of her
bodie was desperat of her life, the Abbot on hother syde se∣inge there was no way to preuent his perill but by the ouer∣throwe of his enemyes, gaue end to the conflict by thextremi∣tie of force, leauinge the aged parentes on grownde may∣med and halfe deade with the number of mortall woundes, but the daughter lightly hurte in the arme, seinge that the wante of strength wold yelde her prisoner at last to the ene∣mye of her honor, thinkinge nothinge lesse notwithstanding then to satisfie his desier any way then by her deathe, vsed the benefit of her fortune, and at vnwares reached GONSAL DO a great blowe thwarte the face, making a blodie podell or bayne for flées in the sommer vppon the nose of mayster Abbot, wherwith holdinge the pointe of her sworde in her hande cryinge vppon thaide of thalmightie, to whom accor∣ding to the shortnes of her tyme she commended the healthe of her soule, she leapte from aboue the bridge into the cristal waues of the cleare Zebete, chosing rather to build her tombe within the bellye of some fyshe or monster of the sea, then to yelde a forcible offring of the firste frutes of her virginitie to the polluted ymage or ydoll of the Synagoge of babylon, but God not willinge as yet to depriue the worlde of so rare a mirror of vertue, gaue her such force agaynste the rage of the streame, that she kept breath, til certeine passengers lea∣ping into the riuer, recouered her wyth diligence of swym∣minge, and brought her on liue to the shore, deseruing bet∣ter the benefit of longer life, thenne the papistical monke, who seing the end and successe of his enterprise, retired into his Abbaie wyth hys skorched face, wythout showing hym∣selfe any more in the stretes of NAPLES vpon his sturring Iennetts for the loue of his lady. The parentes & the maide after they were a little refreshed & restored to their sences in ye felde, wer caried to ye Towne, where euery man, wondringe indifferently at their vertue and valyantnes in so great a peril, gaue speciall commenda∣cion,
to the chastetie of Parolyna, for that she desiered rather to die in the deuouring flodd, then to burne quike in the skor chynge flames and fyer of whoredome, wher unto the wi∣ckednes of the Abbot had almost brought her. And sewer it is to suche maydes, to whome we ought to erect pillers, and graue their vertue in monumentes of eter∣nitie, and not to a cōpanie of vnperfecte and folishe women, who besides their beautie, had neuer any thinge worthye of commendacion. For the respect of whose weaknes, I haue chiefly preferred this discourse, wherein as they maye note in this Parolyna, an acte no lesse valiaunt, then in the moste assured soldiour that euer bare armes, so they ought to for∣beare to glorifye them selues in the glorie of her chastetye, and by studying to ymitate her vertue, to leaue no force vn∣proued, which may serue to gard the honor and renowme of their name, and conquere the wanton delytes of the fraile fleshe, assuringe theym selues, that god ympartes a wonder full strength and constancie of mynd to suche as be chast in dede, and the vertue of whom consisteth not only in thout∣warde argumentes, but is sewerly ram pierd within the strongest part of their harte: like as in the mynd of this, to whom as you see, thalmighty gaue force to vanquishe wyth mayne hande, the wicked enemye of her honor.

The argument YF the wisemen of olde time founde cause of cohibicion in their vnruly chil∣dren, and ympes of wanton youthe, I thinke, we haue double reason, in this age, to vse a steddie eye, bothe vpon our daughters, and such as are geuen vs in socyetie of wedlock, not for that, I wish the one to be kepte vnder, as seruants or seruile slaues, nor to take awaye from the other, the whole skoope of libertie, appointed by the preferment of mariage, but exposinge an Indifferent and honeste meane, I wishe to eschewe the murmore of the world, by cuttinge of suche infyuit occa∣sions of infections, as seme to offer them selues to cor∣rupte and seduce the fragillitie of our youth, chieflye se∣inge a dayly experience of so many assaltes and alarams of fylthye loue, offered to our daughters and litle girles, beinge yet in the firste flame of the fyre whiche nature kindleth in the hartes of such as accompt themselues most confirmed in the yeres of maturitie or discrecion, neyther wolde I that either the maide or the maried woman, shold refuse to haue a bridel put to her libertie cōsiderīgitis such a garde of her quiet and honest name, wyth chiefe defence against the malice of the reprochefull worlde, that it were better to be chayned in the bottom of a darke pryson, then to enioye the benefit of the open ayer, being noted of such spottes of infamy as cōmonly attendes vpon an inordynat libertie and lice nious life, Wherein if the desolacion of so many parentes wepinge in the villanie of their wiues and daughters, vtter ruine and subuerciō of so many hou∣ses, presented in stage playes to feed the aine eyes of the reprochefull multitude, argued not the nomber of incon¦uenience happening by a dissolute and libertines lif, and yt
in the persones of diuerse our great mens daughters now a daies, wee nede not seame so curious in keping this con∣tinuall watche and garde, but resigne such ceremonies to be practised in strang contries wher mē are Ielous of their owne shadow wt opiniō that their wiues or daughters are not able to resist the least and most simple attaynt yt can be offred. But wher thexamples are more then manifest, and the frutes of ye folly burst out in open shew, let vs leaue to allow or assise the brutal opinion of such as perswade that awe is not necessary for youth, or ye seuere correctiō or ra∣ther folysh pamperīg bredes a dolnes of wit, wt impedimēt of ye dispositiō of ye mind, or hinderance to thincrease of na∣tural giftes The daughters of Rome lyued alwaies with∣in the house of their fathers, with no more libertie thē was measured vnto theim by ye eye of their mother and yet we they vertuous matrons in their houses, and so sufficently instructed in cyuilitie, that I doubt ye most perfect courtier we haue at this day deserueth not comparison with ye least of their perfectiōs, for what other ciuilitie or exāple of ho¦nest life cā ye maides of our time, learn in any cōpany now a dayes, if not to seame eloquēt in pratlinge discourses of vaine & filthie loue with words ful of vaine and filthy loue and intiing behauiors of an open curtisan, & somtime to make an experiēce of an act no lesse detestable in dede, thē the remēbrance ought to be hateful to al honest mē, albeit as I wold not by this meanes procure a general inhibiciō of honest conference and cōpany amongest the nobilitie of our cōtry, with exercises tollerated by ye perscriptiō of liber¦tie lefte vnto vs by our aunciēts So it is an indeuor most necessary in mine opinion to make a contēplaciō or view of the maners or inclinaciō of wils with a discression to check such as be to froward, & make slack in some sort the raine
of awful gouermente to them that seame of more tender disposiciō, by ye assistāte of which polycie, it cold not be cho∣sen but vertue shold glyster as greatly in ye houses of great mē, as rude behauior in the cabynet of ye paisāt or vnciuile trankeling, who cōmōly goeth more neare the discipline of thelders in norriture of their childrē, thē such as vndertake to be maisters of art of exquisit skil toochīg ye educatiō of yonglīngs, for which cause the wise Emperour Marcus Aure lius wold not haue his doughters brought vp in ye court, for how cā the norce (saith he,) he honest herself, or ympart vertu to her rhild, seing nothing but practises of euil, and vniuersatie of ye disputaciō of loue, with a thousād vaine delites, to with drawe her from wel doinge, or to showe effectes of a godly lyfe: but to auoide the imputacion or title of a rigorous iudge, whiche some of oure ladies or gentlewomen, maye peraduenture bestowe vppon me, in prescribinge suche straite rules of their reformaciō, I prefer for my only defēce, yt benefit of vertue, who I am sewer, wil alwaies appeare perfecte, as she is, both in bud & brāch, in what soile soeuer she be plan∣ted, wherin aswel for mine owne excase, as also to make, more noble ye sinceritie of noble dames, by thimpudēt life of ye slipperie sort of womē, I haue preferred this exāple of an Italiā coūtesse, who so lōg as her first husbād (not igno rāt of ye humor of her inclinacion) kept her within the blew of his eye, seamed so curious of her reputaciō, yt ye same on∣ly was hable to pleade against al thennemies of her reno∣wme: but ye vaile of this fre captiuitie, was no soner takē away by the death of her husband, but God knoweth what valyant exploites she performed, and your selues may be iudges what false bowndes she gaue to her owne honor, with badges of infamie to hym that shold haue gouerned her, in her second mariage, if you wil use patience in rea∣dinge the discourse that followeth.
THE DISORDERED LYF of the countesse of Celant, who liuynge long in adultery, and after she had procured diuerse morders, receaued the hier of her vvickednes by a shameful death. IN thuttermoste partes of Pyemount, is a percell of thinheritaunce of the Marques mountferrat called CASALIA, where dwelte sometyme one Iames Scarpadon, a manne more notorius in those partes, by his treasure and abhomynable trade of vsurie and fylthie gaine, then of anye reputacion elswhere, by discēt of parentage, or monument of any vertue or godly disposicion, who, marienge a grecian damefell of equal qualitie and calibre, begat of her a dought ter more faire, then vertuouse, lesse honest then was neces∣sarie, and worse disposed, then well giuen any waye, yme∣diatlye after whose birthe, the father (as one ouercharged with yeres, and tormented with care to encrease the glee of his goldē coffers) renownced nature and dyed, bequeathing a porcion of a hundreth thowsande dockattes, to his younge doughter Blanche maria, who dismissing the age of infancie, accordyng to thordynarye course of tymes, seamed sooner rype in yeres, then confirmed in discrecion, or hable to admitt the order of good gouernement: for goinge on the .xvi. yere of her age, albeit her doinges were not voied of diuerse argumentes of bad disposicion, yet the respect of her beauty, with thintisinge desier of her large porcion, forced seuerall importunities in sondry noble men & princes of the contrey,
in such forte, as by extreame sute & mediacion of frendes, she was marryed at last to the Viscount Hermes, sonne and heir of Blāche maria maried to the Viscount her∣mes. the thyefest house in MYLLAN, who incontinent after the mariage, caried her in greate pompp to his house, leauinge her mother to traffyque thaffaires of her vsurye, accor∣dynge to the former trade of her late husbands. This Viscount after he had practised a while thinclinacion of his wyfe, whom he noted more argumentes of wanton and vnseamelye glees, with a desyer of dysordinat liber∣ty, then apparance of any vertue, honest qualitie, or womā∣ly behauiour, began by litle and litle to preuent theffect of so many lyklyhodes of perentorye ylls, by puttinge Abry∣del to her wilfall appetite, wherein notwithstandyng he seamed so precise, bothe to avoyde the name of discour∣teouse on his wyues behalf, and also to shonne thimputaciō of A Jelouse or suspicius husbande, that wythout manye wordes of Keproche, eyther in publyke or secrette, Kepre∣hendinge her faulte Rather by Cyrcumstaunce, then plain The order of a wise hus∣bād in repre hendinge the follies of his gyife. Discourse, he broughte her at laste to dysmisse all Desyer to goe abroade, wyth contentement (perforce) to make her only solace of the societie and companye, whythe she fonde in his house, wherein also for his parte, forgat not to court & embrase her with a more continual haunte of his cōpany, thē eyther was necessarie for his health, or he well hable to performe, neyther yet cōuenient to haue ben don, yf by such pollicie, he had not gouerned her lightnes, & kept her in rea∣sonable breath & albeit the dames of MYLLAN haue a more skoape of libertie, then the reste of the Ladies in any part in Italie, hauyng by custume (as yt were) certaine dayes in the weeke of entercourse and meetinge together, yet thinde∣uour of this viscount, broughte his wyfe not onely in con∣tempt with suche assemblies, but also to disclaime all gos∣soppes trade or other felow shippe, sauing such as she foūde in the house of her husbande, from whose presence shee de∣parted not For any intreatye whatsoeuer: wherewith, her
companions and Ladies of the citie, fyndyng a lacke of her companie fearing withal, that the continuance of suche pre∣cedent, wolde in tyme preuaile aboue their present libertie in procuringe to theim all a semblable restraint from their accustuned accesse, suborned an olde matrone called Madona Hipolyta Sforce, who broakinge one daye with Seigneur Hermes of other affaires, asked hym why he kepte his wife so shorte, with aduise in the ende, that he woulde slacke somwat the bridle of his rigour, and enioyne her a longer line or com∣passe of libertie, leaste the worlde entred into moormure a∣gaynste hym, with ymaginacion that he eyther doated of her beautie, or had her honestie in doute, for (sayth she) ke∣pinge her in this straite mewe, you bringe her fragilitie in question, and wynneth to your self the title of a Jelouse husband. He aunswered her breef demaunde with tearmes of as shorte discourse, obseruing notwithstāding the condi∣cion of his owne estate, and qualitie of her that propouned the question. There is no man (good madam, (saith he) that The vvise aunsvvere of the Viscount thouchynge the gouerne∣ment of hys vvife. speaketh not some time that, which he oughte not to thinke, euenso what eare is priuiledged from hearinge suche thin∣ges as are not true, for suche as are vainelie occupied in disputinge at large vppon my doinges, are ignorant of the cause, and muche lesse knowe they the disposicion of my wyf, whom I had rather kepe captif in seamclie order, then in gyuynge leaue to her libertie, to procure her dishonour, and myself iuste infamye, he that will kepe the thynge pe∣culyar to hymselfe whyche is desyred of many, muste ney∣ther offer yt to the sale, nor suffer yt to be seene but seldom: And as yt is only I that am pryuye to myne owne greef, so I am not ignoraunt of a medecyne to restore the disease, neyther am I voyed of discretion to gouerne in good sorte, the humours of my younge wyfe, nor at what tymes I shoulde lette flyppe the rayne that restraynes the fur∣ther lybertye you seame to require. But where you charge me wyth a dowte of her honestye, blame me not
yf I seeke to preuent that whyche I woulde not sholde hap∣pen, and to auoyde thimputacion of Ialousye, I am content that hensfurthe she come to your house, when & as often &, at such howers, as yt shall like you to desyer her companie, beynge perswaded that the ranke and reputation you hold, will not broke other societie or felowshyppe, then suche as aggree euerie waye with your grauitie and vertue, whiche onely shalbee her skoape, with suche other recreacion and pleasure as she fyndes in my house, to the common conten∣tement and mutuall tranquilletie of vs bothe: for the rest, I wyshe all importunities to ceasse, leaste they wrest me to a further rigour, for as I am hethervnto fullye perswaded of her honestie, so I accompte yt a wysdome to forsee, that the vse of to muche libertie, do not corrupte that, whyche as yet is without spot: wherein treulie he had great reason, and his precedent or example moste worthy of ymitacion, to suche as are in like state touchynge the gouernement of their wyues, for to that kynde of cattall, albeit for diuerse respectes wee ought to forbeare to minister thextremetye of rigour, yet lett vs not forgett for all that, to kepe theym somewhat short, and showe our selues worthye of thautho∣ritie giuen vs by God and nature, in exposynge the rodd of correction, affore they come to excede our awee, or gett the byt betwene their teethe, without power to reclaime theim by any art or pollecie: His prophecie also seamed fully vere∣fyed in the sequeile of the licenceous lyuing of his new wif, for that within fewe yeres after, the viscount, beyng serued with the processe of hys fatall sommonce, gaue place to the worlde, and yelded to the dome of hys destynes, whyche The vise∣count dieth. after Blanche maria had lamented with a fewe womanly tea∣res, and performed the funeral ceremonies, more to defend her from mormure of the people, then for respect of dutie to hym that was dead, she retyred to Mount ferrat, were she also encountred the newes of the deathe of her mother, whyche she disgested in lyke sorte, with an ordynary dule, & repaired ymediatly to CASALIA, where beynge ladye ouer all, and
subiect to the controlement of none, she tooke such a sewer taste, and Sypped so strongelie on the cup of licenceous ly∣bertie, that yt bredd in her an insatiable thurste of wanton and dissolute lyfe, as you shall heare hereafter: for her chief and comon excercise there, was, to force a frizilacion of her haire, with the bodkind, conuerting the naturall coollour in to a glistering glee suborned by arte, to abuse God and na∣ture, by alteringe the complexion of her face by a dye of fa∣dinge coollours deuised by pollecye, and that with more cu∣riosytie, then the most shameles curtisan in Rome, glaun∣cing vppon euery one oute of the windowe, kepinge priuat banquettes in the nighte with a haunte of masquers with couered face, and on the daye, sittinge at her gate as a stale, to allure a staye of suche as passed by the stretes, there was no offer made, whyche she dyd not admit, no request prefer∣red, whiche she dyd not willyngelye heare, nor letter sent, whyche shée dyd not receiue and aunswere. This was the fyrst earneste penny and foundacion of her licencious lyfe, wherein she gained at laste the price and chiefe praise from all women that euer made profession to weare the armes of CVPIDO or marched vnder thenseygne of hys mother Venus. I wyshe the mothers and gouernours of lytle girles in our contrey, wolde respect chieflye ij. moste necessarie rules in theducacion of theyr tender ympes, the one to barre all secret conference in corners, whyche is the greatest corru∣pter of youthe, the other, open and publike cacquet in the streetes, whiche bringes their honour in question amongest the multitude: for as the towne and fortresse besieged, sea∣methe halfe won, and not hable to endure the force of the canon, yf she demande a parley or composicion, so the eare of a woman, that is open to the tale of euerie friuolus louer, or enclyned to giue the leaste creditt to hys discourse, albeyt her honour and chastetie bee not in interest, but cleare from imputacion of iuste cryme, yet dothe shee leaue a sufficient occasion to the people, to dispute and skan her doynges, with
other tearmes then she deserueth, for aswell muste wee a∣voide the suspicion as theffecte of euyll, seinge the good renowme is no lesse necessarie, thē thonest life, And she that VVomenne muste avoide asvvel the sus¦picion as thact of euyll. wilbe noted of integretie, and sincere perfection of liuinge, must not only avoide the acte of adulterie, but also the suspi∣cion of the same: wherfore I wishe all Ladyes to stande so sewerly vpon their guarde, that they neyther be affected to thone, nor infected wyth thother, but rather in deuydinge their doinges into an honeste meane, to do nothinge in se∣cret, whych shame denieth theym to iustefye in publike, nor to be the secretarie of any mans vanitie, or cause of the cō∣mom hawnt or wonder of the people, but rather to obserue the pollecie of the serpent, who vseth to stoppe her eares wt A pollecye of the ser∣pent. her taile, to thend she be not infected wyth the noyse of the charmer. But now to our BLANCHEMARIA, who resol∣ued whollie in the studie and exercises of loue, somtyme sit∣ting in the window, with a lute in her hande, sometime pas∣sing the streetes with open face, more to allure the people to a gaze, thē for her necessary affaires, or take the open ayre for preseruing of health, and now and then (for chaunge of recreacion) to make solemne banquettes, wher the presence of her parentes and frendes, and states of grauitie was not tollerable, but only the companie of the carpet sect, and such as cold make best court to Ladies, where amongest the rest of her ordenarye hawnt, shee was chieflie pursewed by the lorde GYSMOND GŌNSAGA, son and heir to the duke of MANTVA, and therle of CELAND, one of the greatest repu∣tacion for honor, in the dukedom of SCAVOYE, both whi∣che, as they did their best to obteine her in mariage, omit¦ting no meanes to aduance their seruice, and make theim meritorious of her fauour, so she made her onlye pastyme & toke singler pleasure in the sondry ymportunities of these .ii. woers, slenting at their sortes of deuises in woing, smi∣ling at their follie, carping their gesture and behauiour, and Alteracyons in a louer in the presence of his ladye. counterfetting so artyfyciallie their amarus regardes, hol∣low sighes and often tornes of the eye, wyth change of com∣plexion,
and ympedyment of the tong whilest they were vp∣pon tearmes to obteine her goodwill, that she seamed to haue red no other authors, or made profession of other experience in the whole discourse of her lyfe afore: Signeiur Gonsaga pro∣cured thassistance of his mother in lawe, the marques of Mounteferrat, whose perswacions wyth earnest sute in short tyme, had so sommoned the wydow to affection on hys behalf, that the mariage was not onely concluded, but at point of fy∣nall consommacion by order of the church, if the SCAVONI∣AN erle, had not (as it were) forbidded the banes, and inter∣cepted their resolucion by fyne force: for vnderstanding that another had entred the lystes, and made breache, wher he had geuen so many assaltes, and at the verye point to praye vpon his mistres, he vsinge the nexte offer of conueniente tyme, went to the lodging of his ladye, whom he founde all alone, & (as he thought) somewhat disposed to heare his discourse, whiche he broached vnto her, in these tearmes, with a kinde of countenance and gesture arguing sufficiently the simpli∣citie of his loue. If I were as sewer of meanes to releue my distresse, as I am certeine to suffer the smart, I colde easelye dismisse my The carle vvoethe the vvidovve present perplexetie of mynde, occupied with treble dowte, the one, whether I shold blame my selfe, of negligence, ac∣cuse you of rigour (good madame) or cry out of my fortune, which hetherunto hath fauored me with a vainehope of good successe, and now left me to the mercie of absolute dispaire: for the small remorce and slender compassion which hether∣to haue appered in you, do argue a great wrōg on your part, touching the iustice of my cause, seing you haue not only de∣nied pitie towards my sodry passions, but also made none ac∣compt any way of the loyall & honest loue I beare you, for yt you wold neuer allow nor seame to vnderstād any regard or other meanes I preferred for thaduancemente of the same, And yet I find a greater falt in my self, in suffring an other to cut the earthe frome vnder my féete, and marche so farre in my steppes, that I haue almoste loste thée tracke of
the praye I chieflye desyer: but aboue all I complaine vpon our common fortune that hath brought me in daunger of present dispaire, loasinge the thing I Iustely deserue, & you in semblable perill, by committinge you to a place, where your captiuitie shalbe no lesse, thē the slaues or seruile sorte of Moares condēned to ye mynes in Portugale, or Indya, Haue you now forgot the sondrye miseries you endured vnder the gouernement of youre late husband Seigneur Hermes? Doth it not suffice, that he kept you in the mew, & (as it were) in his chamber the space of v. or vj. yeres, but that in retour∣nynge to a more desolacion, wyth exchaunge of that capti∣uitie for a more straite and extreme abridgement of libertie, you committ the remeindor of your florishyng youth, to the mercy of the Mantuans, whose heades are the cōmon fordge, whereupon the humour of frettynge Ielousye doth alwaies beate? weare it not better (good madame) that we, who ap∣proache neare the brauerie of Fraunce, enioying a natural participacion of the ayre and libertie of that contreye, shold lyue and be resident together, then in refusinge thoffer of so greate a commoditye, to make a seconde proffe of the curte∣sie of an Ytalian, who is not so suspicious, as cruell, & apte to synister conceites without iuste cause, and who can not The Ytalian Ielousie by nature. breake thinstinct whiche nature hath giuen hym, not only to doubte of the honestie of his wife, be she neuer so vertuouse, but also to kepe her so shorte with strait imprisonment, that she shall neyther be suffred to visit her frendes abroade, nor admitt any accesse at hoame? besides, what will be the com∣mon brute of the world, if not, that thonly awe and feare of the Ladye Marquesse, hath forced you, to mary her son in lawe, neyther wil they haue other opinion of your doinges, but as a pupill, or one standynge in awe of her tutour, wherein you abuse the libertie whiche the lawe hath giuen you, in suffringe your selfe, not only to bée gouerned, but also forced by suche as haue no reason to rule you, nor au∣thoritie to commaunde you, whiche title, with his sequeile of a thousand incōueniences and annoyes, as I wishe you to
eschewe chiefly for the respect of your owne contentemit & quiett of lyf, so in preuenting so present and yminent a pe∣rill, dispose your self (good lady) to embrace the gifte of a bet∣ter time, and ymagyn that fortune hath here sente her mes∣senger, not only to present you with an offer of preset plea∣sure, but also an assured warrante and confirmacion of con∣tinuall contentement, euen vntill thextreme daye and date of your lyfe, wherin for my part, beyng voyde of solicitors, I am come (as you see) in person, to pleade for grace on mine owne behalf, preferrynge vnto you, a consideracion of the longe and honeste loue I haue borne you, sommoning your conscience also by iustice, not to be vnthankeful in the guer∣don of so due a meritt. You knowe my estate is voyde of ne∣cessetie, or lacke of any welthe, neyther are you ignorant (I am sewer) of my large power & possession in Scauoye, both whyche as I hope, will defende me from charge or note of couetuse desyer, in sekyng the graunte of your fauour, so I laye theim also afore you, as witnesses, to aduouche thus∣muche further on my behalfe, that thonlye respect of your beautie, with other giftes of rare consequence in you, haue sturred vpp my affection, with desyer to do you seruice, and craue good will in sorte of honest and lawfull mariage: and Albeit I coulde yet haue thassystance of a thousande other reasons to iustyfie thusmuche of me, yet reapposing muche for my self in thintegretie of my cause, I commende vnto you the present viewe of an vnfained experience, and comit my selfe whollie to thindifferencie of your iudgement: for yf my passion were not vehement, and my tormēt continual without comparaison, or yf my requeste had neyther reason nor iustice on his syde, I had but righte, yf I were retorned; with a repulse of my dissembled sute, & receiue the due hyer of a deceitful mynde: but seing my demaund standes vppon tearmes of simplicitie, & voyed of treason, importinge an vnfained effecte, semblable to the dollorous regardes of my complerion, and seing withal I come accompanied with sin∣cerity, & vndowted entēt of honest dealing, & that I cānot take

gyue theim vnto vs for companions without seperacion, so yt is our partes to consider at large, afore we resolue of the choice, to thende that in breakyng so holye a ceremonie, we seame not vnworthie of so sacred and highe a participacion. But for my part (sir) yf yt were not to auoyde the grudge of suspicion in the wicked sorte, with the pertiall and poysoned bable of malicius tounges, I assure you, I would liue with∣out a seconde assaye of the curtesye of an other husbande, protestinge vnto you with vnfained vowe that if I thought, that he whom my destenies haue reserued for my nexte con∣sorte wolde represent, eyther in qualitie or condicion, cir∣cunstance or effect, the doinges of hym that is dead the bale sholde be broken from thinstant, and the bargaine reuoked, what earnest or assurance so euer is giuē of it. I thanke you for your aduertisement, with treble tribute, for the honour you do me in desyeringe a composicion of mariage betwene vs, promissing you, in simple consideracion of the same, with the small deceite and dissembled traison I note in you, the francke and free preferment of my mariage, yf I happen to dispose my selfe that waye, with addicion of further power ouer the Ladye Blanche Maria, then any one in the worlde, whereof you maye make as assured accompte, as yf the proff had alredie confirmed my wordes. Therle, seynge so faire an entreye, thoughte not conueniēt to lett slipp the benefytt of so good a time, but fedynge the humor of his fortune, iudged yt no point of good husbādry to loase his frute after yt bee rype, nor his corne for wante of gettinge, but beatinge the bushe as the birde was readie to go oute, recharged her with a seconde admonishement, to bee no lesse carefull of his commoditie, then curious of her owne Quiett, and seyng (saith he) the remembrance of your plages passed, giues you reason to feare the fall of future bōdage, and that the vse of libertie is so deare vnto you, why sticke you to abandon the offer of seruilitie, & embrase a pre∣sente of the quiet you chyeflye desyer, or why make you conscience to condiscende to that, whiche can not redownde but to your honor & contentemēt? assure me by the breath of
your owne month, of the faith & loyaltye of maryage, & you shall sée me purseue the ende and worke it to effect, without offence or displeasure of anie: if ye feare of the ladie marquess restrayne your consent, I thinke you do wrong to the chief vertues wherof she is renoumed, for you muste imagyne, that she wyll not become suche a tyranness over the wyll of her subiectes, as to cōstraine the ladies of her land, to marie agaynste their myndes, and muche lesse force that, whych god hath left in libertie to all sortes, wherwith beholdinge an alteracion of complexion in her face, with a general asto∣nishmēt thorow al her partes, like one ballancing in doubt∣full deuises, not hable to resolue a determynate iudgement wythout the assistance of some speciall councel, toke her by the hande, and kissinge it with no lesse delite, then he founde singler pleasure in thys argument of good successe, renfor∣ced her to a more corage, with desyer not to dismay wyth thassalte, seing thassalyante was readye to yelde to her mer∣cye, neyther doubt to admit hym to your husband (saieth he) who sweareth vnto you, all such dutie, amytie, and reue∣rence, as belong to a husband to performe to hys loyall and lawful wyfe, wyth thys further confirmacion of my affec∣cion towardes you, that afore the consommacion of the ma∣riage by thauthoritie of the church, I wyl assigne you what pryuiledge of libertie, your selfe, can or wyll deuise: do a∣way then the feare of the marquesse, who hauing neyther law nor reason to enter into mislike wyth you, cannot, nor will not reprehende you (I am sewer) in making your fan∣cie A contracte forced, is a vyolacion of mariage. pryuie to the choice of your husbande, for a contract for∣ced, is a violacion of the sacrament of mariage: and let not the simple and bare promisse to the Lord Gonsaga (whom I knowe you loue not) bée any ympedyment to my requeste, for the vow or promisse ymportes no effecte, whiche is pro∣cured by cōstraint: wherwyth the widow: fearing to fal eft∣sones into seruitude, and fully perswaded of the large offer of libertie promised by the erle, was not hable to aunswere his ymportunities in other sort, then with a franke cōsent of her faith, wyth a confirmacion by worde and othe, whyche
likewise he aduowched for his part, by semblable ceremonies according to thorder of contractes, wherin for a more assu∣rance of the knot, and because the corde shold not breake, they wrastled a fall, the one a loft of the other in witnes of the bargayne. This first earnest pennye or pleasante encownter of therle, procured him to contynue his hawnte, wyth more open and familyar accesse then affore, in such sort, as fame discouered ymediatly their secret consentes, whiche also the common brute brought to the eares of the Ladie marquesse, who not∣withstanding shée had iust cause of angry conceite againste the widow, yet the respect of therle, and regard to her owne honor, kept her from any intent of reueng, but swallowing a pil of pacience rather by force, then order of due disgestion, disposed herselfe, also to appease the Lorde GONSAGA, who repeating in his mynde the sondrie argumentes of wanton and light behauior heretofore noted in his lost wydowe, be∣gan to prophecie of thissue and end of his commedie, geuing God thankes for his happie delyuerie from so inconstante a creature, wherin he greued also on the behalfe of thinfortu∣nat erle, that had planted his affection in so pestilent a soile, exposing euen now manifest likelyhodes, of the dissolucion of the delite he seamed to take in his new consort and wantō wife, lamenting more his rashenes in thenterprise, then al∣lowing his wisedom in the choice, for that accordinge to the lattyne adage, he that vseth more haste in thexecucion, then councell or deuise in consulting of his busynes, shall lacke no tyme to repente his rashnes, nor leasure to do pennance for hys folly, and he that in che choice of his wife, hath more respect to her flattering bewtie, then giftes of true vertue, shall easely bée wearie of pleasure, and hardly enioye a conty¦nuall quiet of mind, the want wherof houered euen nowe to ouerwhelme this fond erle, who after publication of the ma¦riage, retired wyth his wyfe, to his house amongest ye moun¦taines and craggie hills of Scauoye, where he began to take
councel of his present affaires, for that Syftynge somwhat nearelye the disposicion of his wyfe, he founde her attyred wholly in the apparell of wanton libertie, and more apte to followe thinclinacion of vaine and lasciuious desyer, then disposed to make a staye of her selfe in the trade of ho∣nest vertue, wherefore he accompted it an acte of wisdome, to take vp the vaine that fedd those humours, and stop her course afore she gained the plaine féelde, wherein albeit he vsed so steadie a hande in the dyot of so daungerous a crea∣ture, ministrynge the remedye wyth the consent of suche conuenient times, and meanes, and in order of suche sim∣plicitye and gentle dealyng, that she had no greate cause to note hym of discurtesie, yet she became veray waspishe in that he was so priuye to her disposicion, and forgat so soone the large pryuilege of the lybertye whiche he had promi∣sed her, reprehendynge wyth bitter tearmes, the generall infidelytie of men, with peculyar exclamacion against thini∣quitye or her fortune, for that, she had refused the prefer∣ment of the Ladye Marquesse, and promisse of mariage wyth Seigneur Gonsaga, exchaungyng diuerse and sondry offers of honor and libertie, for an yrkesome trade of seruile lyfe, wyth habitacion amongest the wilde deserts, and barraine séeldes of Sauoye, not forgettyng to reproche her husbande with diuerse wordes of spite & disdaine, assurynge hym for end, that she wold not remeine lōg coyffed & kept at cōmaū∣dement like a childe that is appointed his tymes to studie, & howers for recreacion. But therle neither ignorant in the sollies of women, nor voyde of experience to practise suche kinde of creatures, preferred a wounderful pacience, as his chiefest remedy against the rage of his wyf, laying afore her notwithstāding in gentle tearmes, the dutie and indeuor of a wyfe towardes her husband, how much (& in what sorte she ought to respect the honor of her self, and reputacion of ma∣riage, and that as no woman oughte to putt in interest her honor or honest name, so the greater she is in degrée, the more haynous is her offence, and a small faulte of a
great Ladie, is most mortall in the eye of ye multitude, who lookes that the lyfe and vertue of greate Ladies, shold serue (as it were) as a torche of cleare flame to gyue lighte to the A litle falte in a great la∣dy is made a mortal offēce in the iudge∣ment of the vvorlde. lesser companions, neither is the chastetie of ye mynde (saith he) sufficient to confirme the perfect renowme of a gentle∣woman, if the wordes and outewarde hehauior of the bodye do not followe thinwarde vertue of the hart, & thordynarye hawnte and exercise, giue manifest declaracion of that whi∣che lieth hyd in the secretes of the stomacke, and for my part I wolde be loathe to giue you cause of miscontentement, seing that in the reapose of you, consistes the rest of my self, and you beynge oute of quiett, I can not escape without greeff, seynge that as the mutuall consent of our wills and affections, with the like coniunction of mariage, hath made you the one halfe and second part of my selfe, so I exspect at your handes only a simple accomplishement of that, which your publike othe affore God and man in the churche hath bounde you vnto, like as also I am readye to performe vnto you thuttermost of any promisse or priuiledge, where of at any tyme, I haue made protestacion, with full assurance frō this present of euerye part of the same, so that you giue me the due respect of a husbande, for as the head beyng the chief and principall part of the reste of the members, hath (as yt were) a speciall authority by nature, to gouerne the whole masse and remeynder of the bodye, so the woman, beynge thinferior part of her husbande, is subiect to all dutifull obe∣dience on his behalfe, & bounde to honor hym with no worse tearmes, then by the name of Lord and maister, for in omit∣tinge your duty towards him, you abuse the vertue of your vowe, approued by sollemne othe, and in incēsing his disho∣nor, you are gultie of the violacion and breache of wed∣locke: one chief ouersighte I note in you is, for that vppon smal causes, you fordge great complaintes, which argueth the rather the ydlenes of your brayne, for the mynde that ys occupyed wyth vanitye, is forgettfull of all thyn∣ges, sauynge suche as thynstygacion of pleasure and
folly, do preferr to her remembraunce, where on the con∣trarye part, the sprite affected to vertue, exposeth alwayes rutes accordynge to so great a gyfte, dissimuling her passi∣ons, with wordes of wisdome, and in knowing-much, giueth not withstandynge a showe of an honest and moderate igno∣rance, & she that laboreth in a passion of particular cōceites, with detestacion of the due respecte of honor, can not studie other workes, then such as seame to fauor her follye, nor o∣pen her eares to any voice, if the same agrée not to the cōplot and cōtentement of her fancie, wherein as I hope, you will, eyther pardō me by iustice, or at least excuse my simplicitie, for that, as you late tearmes of reproche haue forced me to suche a plaines, so for ende, if you will renounce your trade of former folly, and fromhenurth retire to an orderly con∣firmitie of life, you shal not only procure a singler pleasure to me, but cause an absolute contentement with continuall quiet to your selfe, whereof bée careful as you thinke good. Here the erle had great reason and double pollecie, in seking A vvoman re¦formed ra∣ther by faire intreatie the force of con¦straint. to reforme thabuses in his wif without thassistance of cruel∣tie or constraint, for that suche disposicions are rather redu∣ced by faire intreaity, then reclaimed by feare or force of tor∣ments, according to the nature of diuerse of thinsensible crea¦tures, for the fierce Elephant standes not in awe of his kea∣per by force of any stripes, but is made tractable to bende his lardge bodie whilest he mounte vpon his backe, by certeine familiar voices and stroakinges of his keper, wherewith he ouercometh the naturall rudenes and crueltie of the beaste: The Tygre will take foode at the handes of the wildman no∣rished in the caues and desert habitacions amongest theim, where no stripes nor other awe of man can moue any mode∣racton to his wodnes, or cruell nature: So likewise some women, albeyt they are quite deuested of all honor or hone∣stie, yet are they founde to reteine some sparkes of ciuil hu∣manitie, beinge more easelye broughte to a reformacion by gentle order, then reclaimed by the smart of any tor∣ture or crueltie, wherein not withstandynge this countesse
seamed to vse a more extremety, and excede ye doinges of any that euer haue bene noted of disorder that waye, for neither gentle perswacions colde allure her, nor feare nor force re∣duce her to reconcilement, or amendement of life, but accor∣dynge to the stone of Scylicia, vppon whom, the more you be∣ate, to bruse or breake yt in peces, the greater hardnes is dryuen into it, so the greater indeuor therle vsed to persuade his wyfe, eyther by allurement or offer of correction, the more peruersatie he founde in ber, with lesse hope of amen∣dement, and as she vsed a malicious scilence during the dis∣course of his exhoracion, so she forced in her selfe for the pre¦sent, a wounderfull patience, to thend that with the consent of a more conuenient time, she might spitt oute the poyson whiche she shrowded secretly vnder the wynge of her vene∣mous stomacke, wherby for a first proofe of her conninge in the parte she mente to plaie, she forgat not to dissimule her passion, and conterfet the simple ypocrate in suche sorte, as a wiser man then therle, mighte easelye haue bene taken in the snare of her deceite, whiche notwithstandynge she vsed in such couert manner, that within shorte time, she had not only remoued al conceites of euill from the head of her hus∣band, but also brought him to an opinion of a maruelons ho∣nesty and assured confidence in her, in whyche good vaine, & for a more declaracion of his good mynde towardes her, he obserued her fancie so farfurth, as vpon a soddaine he brake vp house in Scauoye, and went to Casaliae, where laye her in∣heritance and chiefe possession. Yf you marke wel the fetche of this womā, in procuring her husband to depart his cōtrey, & what a sodaine checke folow∣ed to him, with a false bound to ye honor of her selfe, you may easely iudge, that a woman once bent, & resolued to do euill, hath a wit to ymagine al malice, & sorts of mischief to be mi∣nisters in therecucion of her wickednes, & that neither feare of punishement, imputacion of shame, perill nor daunger, how mortall so euer they appeare, can staye her from per∣forming the end of her dampnable deuise, wherof the trage∣die
of MEDEA, & follie of the frende of Theseus argueth suffi∣ciently their tickle constācie in vertue, & great zeale and de∣sier Phedra. to do thinges contrarye to all honestie, neither doth the Egle soaring in the ayre, conueighe her selfe to so hyghe a gate, by the force & leight of her wings, as the vaine concei∣tes & ymaginacions of a woman gouernedby her owne opi∣nion, filleth her full of deuises of iniquitie, with desier and meanes to performe thefet of any euill, wherin as I touch only suche as hauing made open sale of their honor, are not worthy eftesoones to chalenge their place amongest the so∣cietie of chaste & verteous dames, so I hope the same is suffi∣cient to procure my excuse amongest the crewe of honeste Ladies and gentlewomen, the rather for that the publicaciō and deyphering of the iuste infamye of the corrupted sorte, giueth a greater show of your glorie, & makes your honour and vertue of more reputacion, neither woulde I be noted in this place of malice, to moue question of theime, whose liues and doinges euerie waye are ful of integretie, nor vse any pertiall adulacion or flutterie on the behalfe of suche, as be notorius of euill in the eye of al the world, but in making an indiffrent diuisiō of the desertes of euery degre, to giue to either sorte his peculiar title, neither conceiling the cor∣rupcion and villanie of the one, nor carping the vertue and iuste renowne of thother, whereof I leaue the iudgement, and my excuse in ballance amongest you chaste dames, who I am sewer do wishe no lesse a discouerie & punishement of the faltes of others, thē your selues desier a iuste encrease of glorie and name of reputacion for euer, and retornes nowe to the pursute of our countesse of CELAND, who dandlinge her husband at CASALIA with a glee of masqued frendship, kissinge & cherishing him after a Iudas order, who embrased her vnainedlie from the bottome of his hart, adding efteso∣nes a freshe remembrance to his late discurtesye, with a ve∣hement desyer to satisfye the glotte of her fyltie lust, whe∣rein she accompted the presence & companie of the countey,  speciall ympediment seing ye so long as she was with him,
yt was impossible to water her gardeine with other pott, then yt which she detested no lesse then thoffer of poisō, deter∣myned to giue present remedie, and putt herself, in free li∣bertie, by a secret fleighte & stealinge awaye from her hus∣bande, wherein for a firste begynning or sewer fondation of this deuise, she leuied, by secret meanes, a great sōme of mo∣ney, She letteth her banke of money ōne in interest at Myllan. whiche she put in banke to ronne in interest to her vse, and reseruinge a thousande doockattes to supplie her neces∣sarie torne till the daye of receite of the vsurie or hier of her banke, wherwith in the only companie of ij. or iij. seruantes, which wer secretaries of her deuise, shee taketh the aduaun∣tage of a faire nighte, when the clearenes of the moone, and starrs fauored the diligence of the caboundes, and fleethe to PAVYA, a towne subiect to the state and dukedome of MYLLAN, where shee hyered one of the faireste lodgin∣ges in the towne, whose windowes opened all vppon the She rouneth from her hus¦bande. street with certeine backe doares to receiue a secret messen∣ger, a shoppe moste necessarie for her trade, and whych also she forgat not to decke and trym vpp with faire beddes, ri∣che hanginges, and other accottrementes of glee, more to allure a repaire of gesse, then eyther seamelie or necessarie for her estate. I leaue you to iudge what Tyntamar entred the head of therle, by the soddaine and secret departure of his wyfe, and I aske this question, how many of you, wold haue raised the hewe and crye, or dispatched any messengers, for the recouerie of so great a losse, I aduouche thusmuche on ye behalf of therle, that at the first noise & brute of thaccident, he did not only enter into tearmesof inordinarage, with intēt to raise the whole contreye, but also was readye to pursue the chasse in persō, albeit after ye furie of his storme was reti∣red, giuing place to thinstigaciō of reasō, & that he had cōfer∣red ye present effect & fact of his wife, with the former circū∣stance & argumēts of licencious desier in her, he rather gaue thākes to his fortune for her frēdship, thē entred into teares or sorowe for thabsence of so lewe a guest, and seyng her de∣parture had discharged his head of a greate deale of care, he
determined not only to vse no impediment to her libertie, but also not to offer himself any waye to recouer her, whose absence imported an assurance of future quiet and contente∣mēt, during the remeinder or reste of his age. He that is as∣sured (saith he) of the malice of his enemye, hath smal cause to feare his force, for that he is warned to stande vpon his guarde againste all doubte or distruste of treason, but suche is in treble daunger, as embraseth in his armes a mortall enemye, in thabite and attire of an assured frende, and tru∣styng to the smilynge regardes of the Cockatrice, doth not es∣chew the peril, till she haue won the place to shootefurth her stinge of mischiefe, yf my wyf had taken longer dayes in dissimulynge her malice, my perill had increased with the ignorance of her wicked intent, where nowe I am not only priuye to her whole disposttiō, but happelie rid of so deceipt∣ful a frend, & secret enemye, who (no doubte) wold not onely haue slaūdered my bed, wt vnlawful adulterie, but indefiling her handes with my blood, woulde one day haue made no cō∣science to cut my throate, or furthered my death otherwayes by some of her ruffyans, or coherentes of iniquitie: I am content with this indifferent pennance, and punishment due to me by ryght, for thextreme loue I hare her, wythout further desyer, that the breath and presence of so pestilent an infection, maye eftsones pollute the worste corner in my house, let her go, and rate her pleasure, at what interest she thinkes good, for this so late and familiar experience, shall suffice not only to instruct, but also warne me to be ware of suche deceiptful and counterfeite ymages. And procedynge still with tearmes of complaint, concluded that the honor The honor of a mā ought not to be de∣faced by the deshonestie of his vvife. of a man, did neyther depende, nor was any waye defaced by the disorder or dishonestye of his wycked wyfe, chieflye, where such abuse is deriued rather of a corrupte inclinacion of her selfe, then any discurtesie or vnseamelye dealyng on his parte: his passion forced hym to exclaime againste all sortes of women, sparynge neyther state nor degrée of that sect, against whome he séamed to inueygh, rather by trans∣port
then consent of reason, and without all regarde or re∣membraunce of any one of thinfynite nomber of honeste Ladyes, whose simplicitie and vpright order of lyfe, do not only defende themselues from the stinge of any reproche, but also discouereth the villenie of suche as abandone theyr honor wythout respect to honest shame, whiche as a com∣panion Shame ought to direct the doinges of vvomen. moste familiar) ought to gouerne and direct the do∣inges of all women. But now let vs resorte to Pauia, and visit the doinges of Blanche Maria, whose renowne in short time, became of no lesse brute in all the corners and costes of Ytalye, then the Corynthyan lays thorow all partes of Asya, being withal so prodigall of her libertie, wyth open and vn∣seamelye meanes, to make her selfe knowen to the worlde, that in the veray viewe and first begynnynge of her trade, appeared infallible arguments of future euils with a disor∣dered sequeile of lyfe. Albeit she seamed to reserue a certeyne maiestie and semblance of respect to her estate, for that she woulde not marche, but vnder enseignes of nobili∣tie, refusing eyther to bée séene or spoken to, of persones of meaner condicion, which delicate and coye order, she seamed to preferr, rather to set a greater price of her marchandise, accordyng to the Grecian curtisan, whom the orator refu∣sed Demosthenes refused the companie of Lays, for that she held a nightes lod¦ging at to high a price. for that he wolde not buy his repentaunce at so highe a rate, then to argue any diminution of her lascinius desyer, for her eye had no sooner encountred any younge and lustie Gentleman, that seamed sufficiently set furthe wyth fur∣niture of nature, and hable euerye waye to performe the ex∣spectation of her appetitte, but her countenaunce and other outwarde behauiour, were readye to make declaracion of her inwarde desyer, roauyng vpon hym wythout respect, wyth suche glée and liberall regardes, that he nede no in∣terpretor to decipher her meaninge, nor phisicion to disclose the misterie of her disease, neyther was she anye thynge inferior to Madona Mussalina the Romaine Princesse, sauyng that she haunted the banke and common places, and this performed her exploites in her owne house, the Romaine
put no difference betwene Carters and men of greater cal∣lynge, and this Demygreque prayed onely vppon nobilitye and ympes of tender yeres, wherin albeit she seamed more delicate of taste then the other, yet she exceded all the Banc∣rowtes of honor that euer were, in this one point, that she was alwayes rather wearie of trauell, then at any time sa∣tisfyed with pleasure, resemblynge a bottomles goolphe, receyuinge all that is putt into it, without castynge anye thinge vpp againe: this was the chaste lyfe, whiche this good Ladie ledd after she had got the bit betwene her téeth, and the raine of libertie within her owne hande, whereby you maye iudge, whether the Myllanoyse or first husbande had raison to refraine her forwarde inclinacion in the firste flame of her youth, seinge that as the gréene ozier or sallow of ij. or iij. yeres groth, is alwayes more plyable then the greate oke, seasoned either by pollecie or confirmed in hard∣nes by the continuance of many yeres, so it is necessarie we kepe an awful hande vppon suche youngelynges, as ap∣peare sooner ripe in appetit, then in gouernement or discre∣cion, to the ende that in plyeng the wax whilest the water is warme, we maye alwayes frame them to the posteye of our mindes, hauynge theim to supplie the necessitye of our affaires. And as the connynge grafter forseing the de∣struction of his stocke, by the tomuche forwardnes of the twigges, and certeine lytle hraunches, sukyng vp the moy∣sture and sapp, whiche should féede the reste of the trée, doth cut theim awaye, to thende the principall bowes maye flo∣rishe, and receiue their naturall norriture, so it is not suffi∣cient to minister correction to youth in their tender yeres, yf we reserue not a continuation of awe, to accompanie their encrease & ripenes of their age, to preuent the harmes wée sée ordinarilye happen by maturitye and to muche forward∣nes in desyer to bee frée from controlment. As she was in theis exercises at Pauya, continuynge a traine of seruauntes accordynge to her trade and studie, it chaun∣ced that therle of Massyne, called Ardizyno Valpergo, came to
the seruice of themprour, by whyche occasion hée retired to PAVIA and lodged in the pallais of hys brother there, he The first vn∣lavvfull louer of the coun∣tesse. was younge lustie, and geuen to all exercises of actiuitie, of semelie stature, wyth proporcion of lymmes according∣lie, sauinge that he halted somewhat of one legg, by rea∣son of a hurte he receuied in a skirmishe of warr, dymynish∣inge not wythstandinge, no parte of hys perfection or shapp of bodye, who vsinge one speciall recreacion in passinge vp and downe the streetes, behelde diuerse tymes the bewtie of the countesse, syttynge nowe and then in a windowe, The order of a curtisan to allure men to affection. geuinge onlye a showe of her face, and sometime woulde walke vp and downe in a gallarie or lowe hall, presentyng the whole viewe of her bodie, and to drawe the straunger to a more desyer to beholde her, shee woulde sometime appeare in braue attire at the porche or gate of her pallais; speciallye at suche tyme as the earle made hys walke that waye, who being alreadie gaulled wyth the arrowes of loue on her be∣halfe, pursewed his queste wyth such deuocion and diligence, that he conquered at last a convenient tyme and meane to speake to her, wherin albeit he preferred but a simple proffer of hys seruice, wt other slight discourses, wherwyth the cour∣tyar or other gentleman of behauyor doth cōmonly fede the tyme, whilist he is in the companye of ladyes, and that the greate maiestie whych shee vsed woulde not suffer hym at the fyrste to geue righte iudgement of this masqued god∣des, yet he saw wel enough, yt he neded not ye whole strēgth of themprours camp to force the place, the which he iudged neither to be so strongly flanqued, nor sewerly rampierd, but the valiant souldiour, being furnished to geue ye charge wt the speare in the rest, might make an entrey wtout greate peril, chieflie for that ye trenches throwē down, and breach alreadie made, yt place was sufficientlie assaltable, for any meane sol∣diour, al which he forgat not to cōuert to ye cōmoditie & aduā∣tage of his desier, together wt ye consent of couentēt time and fortune, who placed theim one daye all alone, wythout any
accesse of companie in her chamber, where he forgat not to preferr his request wyth tearmes of humilitie, according to the vaine order of suche ydle personnes as abuse the gift of time, in pleading for grace in cases of loue, with a franke offer of his bodie and lyuinge, wyth commission to dispose of theim all as she thought good, wherin good madame (sayth he) it is not the sommonce of any synister conceite, or euill opynion, whiche hath moued me to boarde you so farr, but Therle val∣pergo proffe¦reth his ser∣uice to the countesse. rather the vehement instigacion of loue, forcing me to sch an affectioned zeale on your behalfe, that I shoulde do indif∣frent wronge to the stimacion of your honor, and iniurye to the vowe of my loyall seruice sworne vnto you longe since, if I feame yet to prolonge a conceylement of that, whyche the present viewe of your bewtie hath set a broach and com∣mitted to open flame, wherefore if my presente offer, wyth respect of former merit, lack force to wrest a simple grant of fauor at your hand, yet ymagyn (good lady) that in forfeting the pawne whiche I haue preferred for the performance of my promisse, I hazarde also the vyolacion of the faithe and lyfe of a gentleman, wherof I yelde you eftesones a seconde confirmacion by the height and authoritie of the skyes, to be more carefull to obeye you, and lyue in the contynuall awe of your commaundement, then curious of myne own health and safetie, wyth this addicion, not to spare at any time to ymploie my carkasse wyth all that I haue in the defense of your causes, what condicion or qualitie soeuer they ymport. The subtill countesse, albeit she knew wel enough that the fyer was not so kindled in the stomake of therle, as it plea∣sed hym to set a face and fayned show of his passion, and that the large skoape of libertie in his tongue, wyth assurance & constancie in his countenance, argued rather a dissembled zeale, then a true transport of affection in his harte, yet seing hym younge, Iustie, and sufficient euery waye, to aunswers and discharge the combat of her gredie desyer, determyned not to lette slippe the offer of so fytt a praye, whyche shee thoughte woulde suffyce, to occupye the place,
till she hadde fonnde an other to enter the lystes and sup∣plie his lacke, wherwyth she passed a plaine graunte of her fauor vnder these couerte tearmes: like as Signeur Valpergo She graun∣teth fauor to therle. I am not ignorant in thordinarie deceites of men, declared speciallie on the behalfe of such, as reapposinge to muche cre¦dit in their honestie, do geue slender garde of theimselues, so I canne (I thanke god) contente my selfe to smile at their follies, and take pleasante recreacion to heare the braue∣rie of their requests, seaming to burn in the desires of loue, when in déede they are not only farr from such passion, but frée from intent to performe any effect of true loyaltie, sea∣minge also to enterlarde their ymportunities wyth a doble vehemencye, when they go most busilye abowte to make a praie of our bewtie and fragilitie, whereof albeit I accompt you not onlye one of the nomber, but also no lesse desloyall then any of the rest, yet respectinge the reputacion of your race, I am content to geue credit to your wordes, and accept your offer in such sort as you haue promised, reapposing so muche for my selfe in youre discrecion, that there shall ap∣pere in you no want of any thing that belongeth to the go∣uernmēt & wise conueigh of such secret affaires, wherin if I fid an effect of my exspectaciō, your self shal iudge of my li∣beralitie, in retorning the merite of your honest frendshipp, wherwyth thalteracion and breache of countenance in her face, argued a present troble and contrarietie of mynde with in her, whiche therle construinge to procede of a desyer she had to moue hym to dismisse all further delaies, and dispose hymselfe to thexecution of the thinge so indiffrentlie desye∣red of theym bothe, put diligence to the thankefull offer of tyme and fortune, in such sorte, as embrasinge her wyth a thowsande sortes of kysses, hee forgatt all ceremonies and circumstaunces, and gaue her checkmatt wythoute any oddes, vppon a lowe bedde or pallet couered cloase with a vaile or canapie of crymosyne veluet, frindged wyth syl∣uer thrombe, where was such indiffrente likinge on bothe partes, that they resolued at thinstaute of other times
and howers to méete at the shocke in so pleasant a skirmishe, wherin as she iudged hym hable enough to passe ye moosters for suche respectes, determyninge to make stoare of hym, till fortune furnished her of a freshe supplie, so for his part, he founde her so delicate on his behalfe, that he resigned than thoritie whiche earste gouerned hym and his doinges, to the order and derection of her, in suche sort, as he spake nothing but by the mouthe of Blanche Marya, nor did any thing wher∣in her councell and commaundement bare not the greatest swaighe, being so drowned in the desyer of his beastelie trol, and blinded wyth the vaile of filthie loue, that both day and night were indiffrent for thexercise of his pleasure, making her bedd his pryuate lodginge, and delicate armes his place of pleasante excercise and tryall of actiuitie, wyth contynual aboade there, and that wyth suche publike signes and decla∣racion of his diseordered lyuinge, that to the comfirmacion of the common brute whyche passed of their follies, there lacked but some PLAVTVS or TERENCE, to prefer it in pub¦like stage, in the hearing of all the worlde. But what? is it like, that shee that had falsed her fayth to a husbande, more honest and vertuous then shée deserued, wold content herself wyth the companie of this younge erle, or who doubtes, but suche indiffrent women, as haue committed their bodies to the generall seruice of the worlde, are no lesse inconstante in their loue, then voyde of shame, in deuestinge theim of honest vertue, to vndertake so badd a kinde of lyfe, neyther do they like so well of any thinge, as often change of diot, to satisfye their insatiable and beastelie luste, seaminge as it were a champion or challenger, readie to aunswere all com∣mers, for a familiar proofe wherof, I commit you to thexpe∣rience of this rauenouse shee wolfe BLANCHE MARIA, who seynge her newe mynyon so sewerlie lymed wyth the blushe of her bewtie, that only a simple becke was sufficient to commaunde hym, taught hym a newe croscaprey, wyth a thousand trickes and sleightes in vawtynge, wherewyth
also addinge a further experience to his blinde simplicitie, she brought hym now and then to the honor of holdinge the moyle at the doare, whilest an other man ridd her errande in the chamber, whyche trafficke was not wythout greate perill on his parte, for that as the countey CELAND was borne to beare the badge of cornewal in the forme of a second Acteon, so this younge prince was ordeined by destynie to loase hys lyfe, with exspectation of al that he attended by the Acteon trans¦formed into a hart by Dy¦ana. seruice of kinges or forreine princes, by the wicked treason of a pernicious and common whoare, for in this entercourse of her loue wyth SIGNEVR VALPERGO, and verye heat of thamarous glées betwene theim, fortune watchinge to enter the stage, and make sene, that her mobylytie diffreth litle or nothinge from the disposition and incerteintie of a woman, according to ye meaning of the poetes, whiche haue set her furth, in shape, attire, and coollours like to one of that sect, gaue hym an ynklinge of thinconstancie of his mistrys, wherupon followed a litle dymynucion and restrainte of Fortune dra∣vven in shape and attire of a vvoman. his company from her, who being whollie transformed into the forme of an vnreasonable creature, delyting in nothing but to roune, ryot, and hunt for chaunge of pasture, had her eyes and mynde more geuen to glottonie, then her stomake hable to brooke the sondry choice and sortes of dyot, ymploy∣ing her selfe whollie to gather newe soldiours, to supplie the lacke of tholde garryson and wearie capteine, wherein she was assisted, wyth more then a necessarie expedicion, for that wythin some xviii. or xx. dayes, after VALPERGO had taken possession and entred the forte of the countesse, there arryued at PAVYA, SEIGNEVR SANSEVERINO earle of GAIAZO, whose promptenes of wit and perfection of bo∣die and membres, with a valyant corage of the harte, as they made his name and renowme excede all other, betwene that & the mountes, so thys desloyal Aleyne & cruel Medea, had no soner takē a simple view on him, wt a flickering glance of her vncertein eye, but she felt a mociō of vehemēt zeale sturr

Blanche Maria. This embassage, with further commission by the mouth of the bringer, sturred vp no smal alteracion in the mynde
of the younge earle, chieflye for that he sawe hymselfe pur∣sued with a franke offer of that, whiche (yf the affectioned zeale he bare to his deare frende and companion the Lorde Valpergo, had not stayed thattempte) he had soughts longe since to obteine. And albeit he iudged it neyther tol∣lerable by humanitie, nor thoffice of a gentleman, to sup∣plant the pleasure of his frende, and marche in the steppes of his praye, yet being charmed (as it were) with the vehe∣ment wordes of the letter, with opinion that the discurtesie were to greate, to abuse the liberal offer of so faire a Ladye, gaue place to the sommonce and wente immediatlye to her house, where fyndynge her voyede of all companie in her bedd chamber, sawe small occasion to preferr halfe the cir∣cumstance and courtlike wooing, wiche Seigneur Valpergo vsed, for that both the one and the other, after certeine in∣tisinge kisses, and other drawyng allurements performed on both partes, disposed themselues tomake present sacri∣fyce to the goddesse of loue, in putting an effect to the thyng which they both thirsted to accomplish with equalitye of de∣syer, which amarous practise continued betwen them cer∣teine monethes, in such sorte, that therle was so assotted, & became so ydolatrous on her behalfe, that he performed no deuocion to other saint, sauing the vnseamely shryne of his new mynion, who also seing him stāde in water to the chin, & whollie subiect to the yoke of her awe, determined to kepe a harde hande of the bridle, with intent to make hym the bloddye executioner of her detestable deuise against her for∣mer louer Valpergo, whose felicitie defended him eyther frō the peril of that imaginacion, or els God wold not yet gyue leaue to her wickednes, for that her hope was deceiued tou∣ching any help or assistance of her newe frend, for Valpergo seing himself not onely dispossessed of the loue of his Ladye, but dishonored by her mouthe wyth diuerse wordes of re∣proche in hys absence, iudged it no grudge of conscience to mynister semblable reuenge on her behalfe, the ra∣ther for that she was bothe the authour of the euyll,
euill, first breaker of her faithe without cause, and now the begyner of the quarrell of slaunder, wherefore departynge from PAVIA, he painted her dishonestie vppon euerie poste he passed by, blasynge her armes, with suche base and vile coollours, and in suche liberall sorte, that euerye com∣panye whiche he haunted was pertaker of the renowne he gaue to Blanche Marya, who hearynge at laste, what esty∣macion she was in thorowe all LOMBARDIE, by the reap∣port of VALPERGO, began to enter into tearmes of rage, fyndynge a greate difficultie to dysgeste thyngratitude of her loste louer, whose doynges notwithstandynge shée al∣lowed some tymes by iustice, and sawe some reason in hys reuenge, for that her inorderlie dealynge opened the fyrste way to his discurtesie, and by & by flattered her selfe, with a vaine ymagynacion, that menne were borne to beare what ymposicions so euer suche tryflors as she woulde laye vp∣pon theyme, and that seynge they were but seruantes, they dyd but ryghte to endure and take in good parte any thynge sayed or don by theyr mistres, albeyt feedynge still of her malicious coller, with a certeine secret desyer of vengance determyned at laste to retorne hys discourtesye with no lesse interest then the losse of hys lyfe, with resolucion to procure the spedy effect by the hande of hym, whom she pre∣sumed to haue so muche at commaundement, that a simple requeste of her mouthe woulde make hym the minister of that. Beholde with what ympudentie, and ragethys Tygresse goth abowte, to arme one frende agaynste an other, and that yt coulde not suffice to abuse her selfe towardes theim bothe, in the filthie vse of her bodye, but that with intent to mor∣der the one, she puttes in hazarde the equall destruction of them bothe, confirmynge her abhomynable adulterye, wyth manslaughter and wyllfull morder, a synne moste haynous of all other affore GOD and manne, wherein as Morder most hanous in the sighte of god her fretting mynde colde admitt neyther quiett nor conten∣temēt, til her eyes wer witnesses of theffect of her deuise or,
at leaste she had put her intent vpon tearmes to hym, whom she ment to make the bloddie boocher of her beastely wyll, so, attendynge the offer of conuenient tyme and place, she was assisted at last so farfurth, that one nyght as they were in bedd together, and in the chiefest delite of theyr pleasant excercise, she burste soddainly into vehement teares, with sighes and other signes of dollour in suche sorte, that wyth the counterfaite alarams whiche inwarde sorowe seamed to minister and set a broache, her passion appeared so mor∣tall, that her ignoraunt bedfelowe, thinkynge her soule and bodye to be at point to make present seperacion, the one from the other, enquired the cause of her grefe, wyth addi∣cion yt if yt came by displeasure or wronge don to her by any man, his handes onely should gyue the reuenge wyth ab∣solute contentement to her selfe hereafter, wherewyth vsing the aduauntage of his promise, wherein she accompted a suf∣ficiencie to procure the ende of her enemye, tolde hym, that She entrea∣teth her se∣cond frend to kyll her firste louer. as nature had gyuen a certeine facilitie to the vile and base sorte of people, to beare and brooke the offer of any iniurie, so there was nothynge more contrarye to the condicion of the noble mynde, then to bee touched wyth such villanie as puttes the honor in interest, or the renowme vppon tear∣mes of publike infamie: I saye thusmuche (syr) sayth she, wéeting his face wyth the dewe of her waterie eyes, for that the Lorde Valpergo, who enioyed, I can not denye, the like frendshypp I showe vnto you, hath not had shame to blab of his doinges, slaundring me wyth no worse tearmes of infamye, then yf I were the moste infected strompett that euer abandoned her bodye to the Marynors and raskall crewe, alonge the costes of SCICILE: yf he had but made a simple vaunte of the fauours he founde in me, with par∣ticipacion but to his frendes, my honor had been but in question, where now it is past all doubte, besides if he had not added iniurius wordes, to his indecent slaunder, and made a common market tale of the thing which ought to be kepte most secret, I could haue disgested the euill wyth an
ordynarye pacience, wherfore seinge the haynous causes of my gréefe, import a speciall iustice and reason of reuenge, lett not the enemie of the honor of your deare Blanche Ma∣rya, escape wythout punishment, but in accomptynge the wronge whyche I susteine, indifferent to vs bothe, to bynde me (by the benefytt of this reuenge) to a more affec∣cioned zeale towardes you, with an assured loyaltye euen vntyll thextreme dissolucion of my naturall dayes, other∣wayes yf he lyue in the tryumphe of my slaunder, what cause haue I to ioye in lyfe, or comfort to expose the best part in me, for the contentement & pleasure of you, who stayeth to do me reason to so manifest a wronge. Here the young erle felte hymselfe double passioned, whe∣ther he shoulde performe thexspectacion of his venemous BASILA, whom he loued without measure, or absteine from violacion of thinnocent blood of his frende, whome the lawe of frendshypp forbad hym any waye to abuse. Albeit to ap∣pease the present rage of the Countesse, he promised an ef∣fect of her desyer, wyth spedye punishment of hym, who is not worthie any waye (saith he) to serue you but in thought, féedyng her humour wyth franke wordes, dissimulynge notwithstandynge that whiche he thought on the behalfe of the Lord Valpergo, whose honestie he knew to be without ma¦lice, and that his discrecion and wisdom, woulde not suffer hym to sturre vp any synister, reporte without great occa∣sion on her part, besides, he considered that the iustice of the quarell rested in hym, for that he had taken the pray (as yt were out of his mouth, albeit by her procurement, and that after the other had discontinued his hawnte and course of repayre thether, where with eraminyng the circunstance at large, he founde the cause farre insufficient to moue any breache of frendshipp betwene theim, but determinynge to continue the league, he contented her wyth a dissembled promise, and restored in the meane tyme the exercise of their former pleasure, wherein he passed certaine mo∣neths wythoute the tender of anye quarell to the Lorde
Valpergo, who retourned (by this time) to Pauya, enioyed a mutuall conuersacion with therle Sanseuerino, wyth suche indifferent familiaritie, that for the moste parte they vsed but one bedd, and one borde, wyth one purse common be∣twene theim both, whiche was not vnmarked of the mali∣cious Blanche Maria, who seinge so many fyt occasions, with the offer of conuenient tyme and place, assistinge there∣cution of her execrable deuise, with prouocation to therle to performe his promisse, gaue iudgement of the case as it was, that her wickednes was not hable to force an enny∣mitye betwene the ij. Lordes, and that therle Gaiazo did but kepe her in breath with faire wordes, onely to continue the glott of his pleasure whiche he tooke of her, wherefore disdaynynge so greate an abuse in hym, whome (aboue all men) she reserued as the chief piller of her truste, she deter∣mined to make a second experience of the same meane, whiche serued her torne in the dispatche of her first frende, wherein she omitted neyther occasion nor expedicion, for as often as he came to her house, she was eyther sicke, or troubled wyth other bulynes that she coulde not kepe hym companie, not lettynge somtime to shoott her gates against She disconti∣nueth her frēdship vvith the Lord Ga∣iazo. hym, all whiche because she sawe, lacked force to make hym refraine, she retired to thassistance of pollecie, desyeryng hym wyth simple and colde termes, to do her so muche ho∣nor, as to forbeare from hensfurth all access to her house, for that she was in mynde to retourne to her husbande, with whome, theffect of attonement was alredye wroughte by certeine her frendes, who (beinge vpon the waye to fetche her hoame) she woulde not by any meanes should finde her in the attire of a Cortisan, or woman makynge loue. Be∣sides (syr) saith she, not without some dissembled teares, I féele a remorce of conscience on the behalfe of the longe a∣buse I haue vsed towardes hym, and that, albeit my offence Some faultes may be excu∣sed that can not be pardo∣ned. procedynge of follye, seames not altogether worthye of frée pardon, yet it maye appeare in some sorte excusable, so he that confesseth his faulte, gyueth greate argument
of amendement, and restoreth the trespasse to sufficient recompense, desyerynge you for ende, to haue no lesse con∣sideracion of my present case, then heretofore you haue founde no wante of good wyll in me to satisfye the res∣pecte of your pleasure at all tymes, where with (to prefer a more credit to her suborned discourse) she promised hym a contynuacion of fauor, wyth assuraunce of vnfayned good wyll, so longe as nature was content to lende her the vse of lyfe. The erle whether he gaue faythe to her fayned woordes, or dissembled a credytt for the nonst, yet he sea∣med to perswade a trothe in the matter, for that, from the hower of suche conference, he checked the humour of hys accustomed desyer, vsynge exquisitt medecines to morti∣fye that blynd affection, whiche so longe had kepte hym in captiuitye in the bottomles goolphe of his Pyemount, And be cause he woulde aswell remoue the cause as take awaye the disease, ferynge leaste eyther the viewe of her presence, or some force of newe charme, mighte eftesones en∣chaunte hym, and sett abroche the humor of former de∣syers, he retired immediatlye to MYLLAN: He feared al∣so the fall of some soddaine mischiefe, chieflye for that he had sufficient experience of the cursed disposicion of this Viper, whose harte was so infected with the poysoned ayre of euery syn, that beinge wearye of the excercise of whor∣dome, she would make no conscience to furnishe the stage with vnnaturall morders: For what exspectation, of other frute is in them, whose mindes are cleane dispoiled of ver∣tue, if not suche as are allowed by the guyde and wicked spirite that gouerneth their diabolicall disposition, or who is ignoraunt of the tyrannye of a woman, conuerted whol∣lye into the appetit of rage and reuenge, neyther is her crueltye any thyng inferior to the deuouring monster, The barba∣rians more cu¦rious, thē vve, in obseruinge their lavves. and excedes euerye waye, the brutishe inclination of the bar∣barous sorte of creatures, whose rage albeit now and then procureth them to vse force against the natural procreaciō & frutes of their owne wombes, yet do they staye to committ
any kinde of crueltie to suche as haue traffiqned wyth them in the trade of licencious luste, accomptinge no greater sa∣crilege or profanacion of the lawe and ceremonies due to their goddes, then to pollute their handes wyth the blodde of suche as earst haue supplied the luste of their sensual plea∣sure, wherin if they, whych had no kuowledge of god, nor fea∣red the deuill, and voyde altogether of discipline and expe∣rience in humanitie, reserued a certeine honor and respect to nature, why shoulde there be eyther frée dispense or tol∣leracion of punishment to the wretches of our age, who not∣wythstandynge the dayly vse of the lawe, written by the ve∣ry fynger of god, and reueiled vnto vs byhys prophetes and Apostles, wyth diuerse threateninge inhibicions noted in thinfallible booke, do not feare to offende the maiestie of the high este, not only in stayninge theyr sowles wyth the spot of adulterie, but also in dyenge the earthe wyth the blodd of their bretherne and fellowes in Christe, wherein this historie shal present you with a sufficiēt profe for this time. The Lord GAIAZO had no soner lefte PAVYA, then this infernall goddesse began to attempte the recouerie of her firste louer VALPERGO wherin notwithstandinge there apeared an equalitie of doubt and difficultie, chieflie, for that she feared, that he that laste left her, had diciphered her intent, wyth reuelacion of the meane she had deuised to pro∣cure hys deathe: But what enterprise is it, that he dare not attempte, whose mynde is the bondeman and slaue of syn, wherin albeit the beginninge seame to ymport a certeine difficultie, for that the soule preferreth a resistance, and the conscience waueringe, is moued to a remorse and remem∣brance of repentance, yet whan a man is alreadis become old in syn, and the harte enuyroned with the braunches of ini∣quitie, the wycked man hath a more facilitie in thexecution of mischiefe, then he that is good, hable to kepe the renowne of vertue, euenso when youth is norished in ympudencie, and Shame as ne∣cessarie for age as avve for yong mē. age deuested of honeste shame, there is no perill can make the one affraied, nor ymputacion of reproch geue cause to the

Yf the laste wordes of this folishe Lady had not broughte her whole requeste in suspicion, her importunities perad∣uenture had procured a consent in therle, who conferrynge the pointes of her discourse, with her vehemencie in persua∣ding, founde in deede, that her chiefest meanyng tended to the defence of her owne quarell, wherevppon he entred into a pawse, measuring in the secret of his mynde, the tearmes of her present malice, with thexperience and diuerse prof∣fes of the fydelitie of his frende, whom he knewe to be more assured in vertue, thē to ymagyn so great a villanie against him, and albeit he knewe yt was but a fetche of his Lady, to sowe ye seedes of quarrel betwene therle GAIAZO and him, yet to flatter her fond humor for ye time, he promissed to be∣come the mynister of her cursed will, for a more shewe and expedicion whereof, he tooke his leaue, and repaired yme∣diatlye to Myllan, where he ymparted to the Lorde Gaiazo euerie point and Article of the venemous discourse of the Countesse, her conclucion and burnynge desyer of his abso∣lute destruction, with special sute, that only his hādes might be the shamefull execucioners of her execrable deuise, wher∣with therle Gaiazo was no lesse astonied then he had cause, for conferring the tearmes of his present reaport, with a freshe remembrance of a former conspiracie (by his handes) touchinge the death of hym, whom she had now suborned to procure the destruction of himself, cryed oute of thyniquitie
of the gods in sufferynge the earthe to bée infected with the breathe of so wicked a woman, and exclaymed agaynst na∣ture, in that she dyd not abridge the course of lyfe in so hor∣rible a monster, whose pestilent ayre (saith he) yf God defend not his people, is hable to corrupte a whole countreye, oh how iustelye hathe God visited the synnes of her father, for The sin of the father pu¦nished vpon the children. his cursed vsuries, vpon his wretched doughter, and rightly punished ye villenies of her predecessors, in an ymp sprōg of so vile a stocke: how is yt possible to make a froward kite, a forwarde hawke to the ryuer, or the boochers curr to drawe a true sent to the hurte deare? likewise this pattorne of cor∣ruption, beynge the doughter of a villaine, who was borne to no more porcion, then vij. foote of inheritance in the church yard, and her mother more faire then chast, and lesse vertuouse then honeste, hath not onlye abandoned her con∣trey and husbande for the glott of her insatiable luste, aun∣sweringe all comers without excepcion, in the singler com∣bat of her beastly desyer, but also is come to keepe an open boocherie or slaughter house to execute the nobilitie of Italy, But for my parte, yf yt were not for ye dishonour that wolde attende me, in defyling my handes with the blode of suche a filth, I assure you I wold drawe her by the haire to the pu∣blike theatrie or place of execucion in Myllan, where after she had confessed, how often and in what sorte, she hath de∣siered me, with her handes cloased, and eyes full of dyssem∣blyng teares, regardyng the maiestie of the heauēs, to co∣mitt morder vppon my deare VALPERGO, thies handes should deuide her villanous carkasse into more peeces then there bee dayes in the yere. And besydes, I was neuer of so vile or base cōdicion, but that I durste discouer and aduon∣che what grudge so euer I had conceiued agaynst any man, neyther doo I thynke that you haue other opynion of me, then to bée one of your moste loyall and assured frendes, whereunto thother replyed that thonlie respect of the fide∣litie he reapposed in hym, keepte hym from performynge
her pernicius and bloddie sommonce, and that he had not on∣ly disclaymed her acquaintance and companye also, but a∣bandoned the place of her beynge, for feare of further en∣chauntement and seynge (sayth he) that God hathe holden hys holye haunde ouer vs, and our fortune hetherunto de∣fended vs from daunger, lett the viewe of our perill passed, withstande the offer of future mischiefe, and in eschewyng the ayre of suche infection, let vs also from hensfurthe dys∣misse oure deuocion to that ympp and ymage of SATHAN: had yt not bene a greate comendacion to vs, to haue entred into quarrell, and committed mutuall slaughter, one of an other, for the recreacion & pleasure of such a minion, who∣se simple remembrance I assure you is so hatefull vnto me at thys present, that I fynde a falte in my selfe, that in byd∣dynge her farewell, I gaue her not an hundreth estocka∣does thorowe the bodye, to thende the example and due hyer of her badd lyfe, myghte procure a terrour to others, that thurste after the blood of suche vnnaturall morders: Albeyt as the course of her wretched lyfe argueth an vnhappie end, soo I dowte not but her miserable deathe wyll take suffy∣cient reuenge of the wronge she hathe offred to vs bothe, In the meane tyme I wishe in vs both an vtter forgetful∣nes of her and her follies, And feynge the gayne shee hathe gott by vs, maye bée cowched in the leaste corner of her cof∣fers, wée haue small cause to greue in any losse, sauyng in the ympairiuge of our reputation, for yeldynge honour to one so farre vnworthie of our companie, wherewyth ended the discourse betwene the ij. young Lords, who (euer after) forgatte not to contynue the remembraunce of theyr ve∣nemous BASILIKE wyth woordes of oppen infamye in what companye so euer they were, bothe, what intisynge meanes she hadde to traine menne too her lure, and wyth what subteltyes shee dismyssed theyme, beynge wearye of their companye, or when she sawe an offer of fresh sup∣plye, the brute whereof, Albeyt gaue her certaine frettynge
alarams at the stomake, yet nature hadde lente her suche a grace, that she neyther blushed at the same, nor was mo∣ued to remorse wyth the viewe of her euill, But disgested both the one and the other wyth an ordynarie face of shame∣les complexion, wherein notwithstanding she was neyther so precise nor constant, but the inwarde grypes she felt, had almoste forced a depryuacion of libertie and sences, the ra∣ther with the view of an Italyan Epigram, inueighinge bit∣terlie agaynst her disordered life, composed as they sayd by therle VALPERGO, whyche because I neuer sawe, nor haue meanes to recouer a true copie, I leaue without iudgement or reapport, But thusmuche I dare aduowche of her colle∣rike passion, procedinge chieflye by that inuectiue, that if she had had eyther capteine or soldiours at her cōmaundement, she had made ij faire Anotomyes of bothe their bodies, wher∣of notwythstandynge Signeur Valpergo escaped not without sharpp pennance, as one vppon whom she founded her grea∣test grudge, for that as he was the fyrst that skirmished with her, hande to hande in her cloase chamber, so he was the last that brake his fayth, and dissembled theffect of his promisse: By this tyme euery post and posterne in PAVYA was pain∣ted wyth pamphelettes, written in proase and verse of the bowntefull lyfe of the countesse, euery comedie and stage plaie babled of her vicious trade, the bells rong of her inordi∣nat luste, and the birdes in the Ayre cryed out agaynst her, in suche sort, that she did not onely refraine to come abrode, and show her selfe eyther in streete or windowe, but ymagy∣ninge that the chaunge of ayre and place woulde take away the blaspheymous noyse of the brute, trussed vp her baggage, and departed by moone lighte wythout sounde of trompett from PAVIA to MYLLAN, where, as she was first inuested wyth robes of honor by mariage with the Viscont Hermes, so her destynies seamed to reserue that place as a witnes and theatry of her degradacion, not only of honor, but also of lyfe, for she had not longe so iornied at MILLAN, but there arryued a capteine wyth a charge of certeine trowpes of
horsmen called Don Pierro de Cardonne a Scycylyan borne, and bastarde brother to therle of Colysan, whose father dyinge at the battel faught at Bycoque, lefte hym no other porcion nor reuenue, but such as he gatt by the enterteinement of the warres: his age exceded not xx. or xxj. yeres, somwhat swarffye of complexion, and mallencollike in the regarde of his countenaunce, wyth a skar or hurte in the face, lent hym by chaunce in a fraye, but for the rest, sufficiently fur∣nished with good proporcion, who made his chief excercise to passe vp and downe the stréetes, where glauncinge nowe and then vpon this alluring ymage of Venus, tooke no tyme to debate the matter at large, but vppon the sodaine be∣came extremelie in loue wyth her, in suche sorte, as he en∣tred into deuise, to haue familiar conference, and make an offer of his seruice vnto her, who better experienced in the trade of loue then he, albeit she sawe hym younge and hable enoughe to aunswere the combatt of her luste, yet to sturre vpp a more vehemencie of loue, and gyue her selfe a greater incorporacion in his harte, she lewred hym by péecemeale, tyll she had sufficientlye manned hym, and framed hym by the measure of her owne will: for yf this younge pigeon of the fyrste plume chaunced to espie her out of the windowe: yeldynge her reuerence wyth a sighe accordynge to the vaine Spanyarde, she woulde not sticke to requite hym wyth a countenaunce of semblable cur∣tesie, and soddainelye shott the casement, and withdrawe her selfe from his sighte, leauynge the sellye Captaine, tye∣ringe vpon a taste of pleasure enterlarded also wyth a des∣perate hope neuer to enioye her otherwayes then in secrett and vncerteine wishes. And albeit he was of sufficient ex∣perience to traine and leade his men, wyth corage enough in the feeld, yet seamed he no lesse voyde of skill then farre from audacitie, and so ignoraunt in the pursute of this queste, as if he had neuer made courte to any Lady of reputacion or honor, whiche forced the rather a vehemencie of his torment on the behalfe of his newe mystres, whose
maiestie and coye estat, keping alwaies within her pallays, as yt argued a certaine degrée of honour, so the same gaue also a greater increase to his passion with intent to do her al honor he colde, for besides, that he passed by her gate euerye daye in greate brauerie of chaunge of horse and apparell, with his men moosteryng aboute hym, and other pomppe of a capteine, makynge his horse make good the Toto Pomado with other loftie tornes aboue grounde, when he came a∣gainst the window that yelded the first view and prospect of her beauty, yet for a further declaraciō of his affectioned ser∣uice, he walked one euening a long the pallaice of his ladye with a noyse of softe musicke, to procure her to come to the windowe, when himself tooke a treble lute, and gaue her a good night, in a songe, no lesse dolefull in note & tune, then of desperat substance, with such stoare of sighes and regards of pitie in his face, that who had séene his ghastelie counte∣nance at that time, wold haue iudged him to bée serued with the laste processe and sentence diffynitiue of his lyfe, or that he had made loue to one of the blood royall in spaine, in the end of whyche moarning musike, Dom Pierro, as one out of hope to recouer any one ote of fauor of his mistrys, beinge vpō his departure and retire to his lodging, was requested, to come in by one of her women, who opening the gate, con∣ueighed him alone thorowe a faire gardeine into a large gallerie, honge on either side, with sondrie sortes of pictures and tables of loue and follie, where the countesse did not on∣ly giue hym greate thankes for the honour he dyd her with hys solemne musycke, but also yelded hym suche other choice of familiar curtesye, that he seamed rather astoni∣ed with the presence of the place he so muche desyred, then hable to bestowe anye thankes, or other symple showe of dutie vppon hys newe gooddesse, who seynge hys sympli∣citie, thoughte yt was now time to stoppe the lewer vppon him, and giue him some assurance by wordes & effect, aswell as she had trained him so far by argumēts of outeward glée, wherfore taking him by the hand, she led him to a lowe bedd
furnished with gréene satten, where (beinge set together) she vsed this shorte order of collacion vnto hym. Albeit (syr) ye show of my present curtesy may stur vp in you The coūtesse to her last lo∣uer. some cause of synister suspiciō, the rather, for that, hauinge no other knowledge, nor assurance of your honest behauior, then a simple reaport of your name and nobilitye, I haue gyuen you credit to enter my house, at so indecēt an hower, yet being in som part excused by the libertye of our contrey, which excedes the strait inhibition of the Ladyes in Spaine and Scycylya, I am also to defeate all sortes of imputation that waye, by the speciall regarde of honor, I haue alwaies vsed on the behalf of straungers, towardes whom, as I was neuer a nigarde of my liberalitye, specially, when they do me that honor to visitte my house, So for your parte, for that I fynde no cause asyet eyther to disclaime or discon∣tinue my accustomed bountye from you, I am content to as¦sure you no lesse welcome, then any man that euer had ac∣cess hether, with commission, that the doare, beinge readye to bee opened at what hower so euer you knocke, you maye bee bolde to dispose of me and myne no lesse franklye, then yf the propertye of all that I haue rested in your selfe: which enterteinement, as it was vnloked for of Seigneur Pierro, So the liberall offer of hys mistres toke awaye the passion of his domme traunce, and not only restored hym againe to the libertye of his speache, but also renforced hym wyth a new corage to put his request vpon tearmes, and make a tender of his seruice, wyth protestation, that if she woulde passe a graunt of her good will, and admitt hym for her secret ser∣uant and frend, he would vse such indeuor to make declara∣tion of the dutifull zeale he bare her, that she shoulde fynde hym nothing inferior to any gentilman that euer made pro∣fession of loue or other seruice to his Ladye, nor haue cause any way to mislike her choise, for yt he wold neuer be so rash in promise, as redie to expose an effect, nor she so willyng to require, as he twyse diligent to parforme thuttermost of her cōmaundements, she felyng her selfe clawed in yt place that
ytched most, replyed with a smyling countenance, that ther perience of the often breache of promisse in suche as vse to court vs simple Ladyes wyth the marchandise of loue, doth argue so much thincōstancye of men, (saith she) that for my part, if I sawe a present effect of true loyaltye before myne eyes, yet could I hardlye he brought to repose eyther credit or assurance in any promise, seing men them selues nowe a dayes are infected wyth the ayre of such fragility, that they neyther respect the honestye of their word, nor the vertue in parformyng the least effect of a thousand liberal offers they make at vnwares. Albeit as he yt chargeth the guyltles with the offence of the murderer, doth wrong to his innocencye, so I haue learned that it is a speciall vertue to be persiall in opinion toward straūgers, and iudge the best of euery man. wherfore for your part (syr) if you will enlarge the offer of your fyrst faith with this addicion, that I may be bold to im∣ploye you in one spectall affaire of mine at suche time as I shall sommon you therunto, I am content not onely to put you in possession of your request, But also to bynd my selfe to no lesse loyaltye on your behalfe, then euer appeared in any Ladye to wards her faythful seruant. The captayne that would willyngly haue sacrifised hym selfe for the raunsome of her fauor, stoode not to examine what charge she would en∣ioyne him vnto, but cōfirmed an assurance with sundry sorts of othes, being no lesse rashe in ye promise of euel, thē hastie to performe thexecutiō, as herafter you shal heare. Here was brewed the broth or preparatyue of the fatall obsequies of her former loue, & the earnest penny gyuē of the blodie bar∣gayn & death of Seigneur Valpergo, for she, by the too liberall & vnhoneste vent of her honor, made him the Borreau & vnna∣tural executioner of noble blod, defacinge by ye same meanes the gentrie of his house, which he ought to haue preserued til the last drop of blood in his body. And remaining there al that night, she made him so pleasant a bāquet of delicat kysses & other exercises of ye bed, that the more he tasted of ye pleasure, the more he thrusted with desyre to cōtinue ye sport, & ye subtil
Cirses for her part, semed so vehemēt in loue, with dissimuled arguments of vnfayned affection that in persuading him∣selfe of the victorye of her good wyl, he thought he had made a conquest of the whole easte parte of the worlde, seming so drowned in the deuocion of his new Sainte, & charmed with the enchauntmentes of her art, which (peraduenture lente her some power or assistance of legierdemain) to force his humor of earnest zeale, that if she had sayd the worde, he had made no conscience to haue committed the whole Citye of Myllan to the mercie of fyre and gunpowder, lyke as Blouse de Cume, was redye to put fyer into all partes of the cytie of Rome, if the Sedicius Tyberyus Gracchus had geuen it hym in charge: suche is the rage and frantyke folye of youth, when they suffer their amarous transport to excede the caryr of reason or discression, and from this fountayn haue distilled heretofore many destructions of Realmes with subuerciōs and alteracions of monarchies, wherin also may be noted a maruelous corrupt and vaine disposicion in such as wyl ra∣ther affect and haunte the companye of a publike curtysan, then honor the vertue of a chast lady, although she were his lawful wyfe and companion of bedd, and yet those gallan∣des wyll not sticke to Ieste and point at the maried man, go∣uerned sometime by the sage aduice of his lawful wife, wher they seme readye at the commaundemente of a strompet or arrand whoare, not only to hazarde the price of their honor, but also (in fauoring thinstygaciō of her wickednes) to make their testament vpon a skafolde layinge their heades vnder the edge of the sworde of Iustice, wherin I nede not torne ouer many bokes for copy of exāples, seing you may be suffi∣ciently satisfyed wyth ye view of the folye of this bastarde of Cardonne in performinge the suggestion and malice of this mordering corntesse, who seinge her captayne sufficientlye framed to the postey of her wyll, thoughte it was now time to put him in remembrance of his promise, and somon him to the reuenge of them that thought no more of her cōspira∣cyes nor traynes of treason, wherin as the howre approched
that her Lasciuious trade of life shoulde be enioyned to open pennance, and the wrong & violacion of faith to her husbād, with her pernicious intentes & effectes of murders, receyue theire due hyre and punishment, and that the rage of de∣stenie woulde not be appeased tyll som man weare commit∣ted to execution, so for a more expedicion of the fatall ende of her miserable lyfe, she entised her bastard louer into a close arbor in the gardin where only ye byrdes weare witnes of their discours, and brake with hym in this sorte. Yf na∣ture (Sir hath gyuen to euery one a speciall care to holde the vse of lyfe moste deare with a peculyar desyer to fauor the cours of our dayes wyth so lōg a tearme as we can, how much more are we bounde to embrace and be carefull of that whiche causeth vs to lyue wyth a singuler renome from a∣mongst the rest of the baser sort of people, who lyenge al∣waye in watch to marke oure order of lyuing, are no lesse glad to haue an occasion of slaunder, then redye to impart it to all the worlde, with such percialitye of vnworthie bruit, yt the greater we seame in degrée, the more hainous they make our offence, and mortal fautes not only scarse noted, but also tollerable in meaner personages, wherin as we women are most incident to the awe of that malicious clymat of people, both for that they Sift vs and our doings more narrolye thē the rest, and because we beinge the weaker companye, are not armed with sufficient force to resiste their rage, so the indifferēt sorte ought not to be rashe in iudgement on their sydes, nor gyue sentence of discredit or dishonesty againste vs, the rather by a sinister suggestion of suche a vulgar and barbarous crewe, neyther ought we to spare or feare anye sort of reuenge, whiche maye aduaunce the recouerye of that wherof we are wrongfully deuested. Thus much I haue inferred (syr as a preamble to the request I meane to make, which I take god to witnesse procedes not to much of desyer to pursue the reuenge of wrong I haue al∣redie receiued, as to make knowen to all the worlde, wyth what integritye I go about to preserue the renome of my
former reputacion, knowinge ryght well that the earthe beareth nothing so precious or of so great value, that is ha∣ble to restore or make good the forfeiture of the honor of a la dye of equall Calibre and callinge to mee, And because I wil not kepe you in long suspence, nor with tedyous circum stance moue anye myslike to hym that hath offered to Iustify my cause against them, whose wickednes haue procured these tearmes of iust complaynte, it may lyke you to vnderstand, this, as not long sins I remayned at PAVIA wyth a trayne conuenient for my degree, may ntaynynge court and hospi∣talitie in suche sorte, that the greateste estate seamed content wyth myneordynar ie, so amongest the rest of the repayre and accesse to my house, I was vysited wyth an often hawnt of two earles of equall nobylytie and sembla∣ble discent of honor, to whom albeit I vsed an indifferente countenaunce, exposing no great argument of famylyaritie on their behalfes, then (as you se) I show to euery gentlemā, yet forgetting thestymacion of their owne race, and ranke which I hold, they haue semed of late so vnthankfull, to the honor I vsed towards them, that I fynd a returne of the me∣ryt of my curtesye wyth a general brute of open slaunder, begon and contynued by them, who also cease not as yet to endeuor to make my name no lesse notoryous of Infamye, then if I weare the most cōmon curtisan in Rome or Venyce wherin as the vertue of my Innocencye is hable to satisfye thopynions of such as know me, for that thintegretie of my life hethervnto parswades them, that I am bothe belyed by malyce, and slaundred wythout cause, so al straungers, and specyallye the vulgar sorte, conferringe my delycate and braue order of lyuinge, wyth the parnicious rumor of these gallandes, doughts not to confirme their vylaynes wyth an absolute Iudgemēt, that I am no lesse dishonest in dede, then their brute hath published in euery corner and cuntrye of I talye, wherof besydes yt myne owne conscyence doth abso∣lue me, yet dare I pleade & appeale to the testymony of your
selfe to depose the contrarye, protestynge vnto you by the heyght of the hyghest throne in heauen, that onlye you haue vanquyshed the chastyty of Blanche Marye, who yf she should anye waye lose your presence, could not enioye the ayre of MYLAN four and twentye howers, for that, those roysters & slaunderus earles haue brought me in so bad a tast amon∣gest all honest companye, and yet would I not depart with∣out a reuenge of the wronge they haue done me, wherein yf I cannot be assisted wyth the helpe of anye man, I assure you this carcasse shall eyther be found dead in thenterprise, or these handes shall comitt the fatall execution of these cor∣rupt wreches, whose malice haue set abroche the vessell of vnworthye slaunder to myn honour and estymacion, wher∣wyth she forsed a sodayn complexion of dolor in her face, in such sort, that the teares which distilled from her eyes drop∣ped all a longest her chekes and brestes of the coollour of thazured alablaster, and watered the whole bosom and body of the Scycilyan, who hauyng no other god but the countesse, and seynge thympetuositie of her distres, enquired of her in a meruelous rage, what he was that durste abuse her, who had at commaundement a captaine with his whole en∣seigne of men at armes and soldiours, ready to march at the sounde of her drom, to defende her quarrell, and take ven∣gance of such as oppresse her, swearyng at thinstante by the faith and honour of a soldior, that if he knewe the names of thies ympudēt wretches, al ye world shold procure no dispen∣se of their death, and he only wolde cutt theym in as manye peces, as there be members of their wicked bodyes, where∣fore (saith he) (ymbrasing his infernal goddesse) giue me on∣ly a note of their names, and you shall sée what difference I vse betwene doyng & sayinge, simple wordes and dedes of effecte, and do away thies teares withoute further remem∣brance, or care to reuenge your enemyes, for you shall sée, that I will tonse theym so conyngly, that herafter they shal neede no barber to rownde their haire. This franke promisse with the liklyhode of spedye effecte,
breathed suche a freshe ayre of consolacion into the morde∣ring countesse, that after she had coolled and embrased hym in a thousande sortes, with an offer and liberall dedica∣tion of her life, with all that shee had, even vntyll the laste and extreme dropp of her blodde, tolde hym the names of her enemies, who saithe she, are not hable to make good anye waye, the forfeiture of myne honour but by their deathe and perentorie destruction, wherewith he willed her eftsones to dismisse all care, and reapose herselfe vpon him, for saith he, afore thexpiraciō of many daies, you shal heare such newes as you long for, wherin he failed neither of the tyme nor effect of his promise, for that the nexte night hee was aduertised by certeine espialls, which he had set for the purpose, that therle Valpergo, supped in the towne, wherfore he armed him self with twentie menne at armes of his sol∣diours, and laye in ambushe of eyther side the strete, where therle should passe in his retorne to his lodgynge, who with his brother arme in arme, with some fyue or six of their pa∣ges and seruantes, betwene ten and eleuen of the clocke in the euenynge, came deuisynge merely together till they were at the Iaumbe or torne of a streete that stretcheth to sainte Iacques, where soddainly they sawe theym selues as∣sailed and set vpon on all sides with men in armor, and fin∣dynge their force far to weake to mainteine skirmish with so greate a trowpe armed at all pointes vpp to the throate, and they onely, the simple assistance of the rapior and cloke, began to flee, but they founde astopp of passage in euerye place, in suche sorte, as therle and his brother, with the rest of their small crewe, were cutt in peces in one instante, al∣beit as morder is the synne moste detestable affore God, so we see fewe or none escape vnpunyshed, nor any done in suche secret but the maiestye of the higheste, reserues a No morder escapeth vn∣punished meane to discouer it, for in the heate of this sharpe medley, therle ARDIZZYNO espied the basterde PIERRO, whome he named and called vppon manye tymes, but all in vaine,
whiche beyng harde and aduouched by one of the townes∣men, standyng rather in his windowe to crye ayme, then helping any waye to parte the fraye, was the cause that he was taken the same nighte, and committed to prison, by thautoritie of the duke of BVRBON lieutenante and chyefe gouernour within MILLAN for themperour Charles the fyfte, and the nexte daye fearynge the offer of the racke or other tormentes, he confessed the facte, wyth the cause to procede of the sinister subornation of the Countesse Blanche Marie, whose lyfe and trade, accordyng to the discourse you haue alredy harde, he ymparted at large, to the DVKE and reste of the councell, she beynge aduertised of the whole, had tyme and libertie to flee, but god whyche is iuste, would not that her wickednes shoulde bée assisted with anye lon∣ger date, seynge that if she had liued, her malice, woulde al∣so haue raged vppon therle GAIAZO, who by good chaunce was at that tyme out of the towne. The nexte daye shée was sente into an other prison in the towne, to auoyde conference betwene Dom Pierro and her, whereof there was more cause of feare then néeded, for that vppon the firste examination, she confessed the whole con∣spiracie, trustynge belyke, in, I can not tell howe manye her thousande crownes, where with shée hoped to corrupte the gouernour or suche as bare authoritie vnder him, wher∣in her exspectation, was no lesse frustrate, then her desti∣nies seamed wearie to fauour her with longer lyfe, for the offer of her crownes was hatefull to the vpryghte mi∣nisters of instice, and other meanes of medyacion hadde no place in the senate, for that she was iudged to bée taken oute of prison, the seconde daye after the morder, and loase her head in the place of publicke execution, in the meane while, the capteines of the armye, purchassed the lyfe of the bas∣tarde of CARDONO, and sente hym with diuers letters of comendacion to themperour, who for the respecte of hys experience and practis in warre, aduaunced him to a charge
conueniente for his skil. And albeit the laste arreste and sentence diffinitiue of the miserable countesse, was communicated vnto her, to thende she mighte put her selfe in readines to passe the dreadfull iourney of deathe, yet seamynge to repose muche for her selfe in th'assistance of her coffers, she neyther dis∣mayed at the newes, nor disposed her self any waye toward God, vntill the sergeantes criminall, taking her out of her dongeon in the castell, led her to the fatall theatrie in the market place where was erected a faire skaffolde, to playe the laste acte of her tragedye vppon, there ye wretched Ladye entred into open confession of her faltes and former lyfe in the hearyng of the multitude, desiring God vpon her knées wyth greate effusion of teares, not to deale with her accor∣ding to her deserts, but that she mought enioye the bene∣fytt of his mercye, and that he woulde not argue agaynste her, for yf he iudged her accordinge to her iniquities, shée was not hable to abyde it, and so desyering the people to pre∣ferr their prayers on her behalf, for her better assistance of ye spirit of grace in her perillous passage which she had to par∣forme, she renounsed nature by the deadly blow of the sword of execution whiche toke awaye the head from the parni∣cious bodie of her, who in her life neuer founde any wicked∣nes whyche shee dyd not onelye ymbrace, but excede wyth ymitation, and increase with further vylanye, nor was acquaynted with any vertue, whyche she dyd not abuse, or conuert into an agrauacion of synne: a goodlye example suer, for the youth in oure tyme, seynge that the greatest parte launsynge indifferentlye into the gulphe of all ab∣hominacion, are gouerned onelye by the transport of their vaine & foolysh conceits, without hauing respect to the sūdry, mischefes & impositions of shame which fayle not to attend the end of suche exercises, for yf the Lord of Cardonne hadd not bene rescowed by th'assistance of a good fortune, and ta∣ken
out of the handes of distresse by speciall ayde of thother Captaynes, it may be easely iudged what miserie had thun∣dered vpon him by geuinge himselfe in praye to the flatte∣ringe appetit of a lighte and foolishe woman, who seamed to yelde him more glée or fauor, for the satisfieng of her own lust, and to performe her malicious deuise, then for any re∣spect of loyaltye or true loue, Indiferent care of his honor, or honest regard to her own estimation, and trewlye as hys misfortune is great, that bestoweth his affectiō vpō a whore, for that he is incident to a thousande inconueniences: So his folye is no lesse, that perswades himselfe to be beloued of a common doxie, seinge their amytie continueth no longer then they reape eyther pleasure or profit, neyther are they so inconstant in loue, as voyde of measure in Imaginacion of mischiefes, wherin for that our plentiful time yeldes vs choyse of examples and sorte of familyar experience, I am content to abridge the Iustification at this tyme, for that to maintain continuall argument of morders or affaires full of peril, is often hurtful to the quyet mynde, desiring som∣time a pleasant recreacion from affliction, no lesse then the pylot or weary mariner couets a present calme and appea∣sement of angrye EOLE after they haue bene longe for∣wearyed in contending against the malice of their fortune amonge the perillous strayghts of thunquiet occean. And albeit the corruption of our owne nature is so great, that we take more delight to heare a discours or beadroll of folyes, then in reportes enterlarded with admonicions full of reason and wysedom, yet am I perswaded, that suche as haue their mindes typped wyth vertue, cānot be so perua, nor voyde of good disposition, as the other wretches, whose lyues bearynge the badge of infamie, makes theim also se∣questrated from the reste of the good sort, wherin we ought to be fullye resolued, that there is no Hystorie, (howe full of pleasant delyte so euer it appeare) which yeldes not with all, wholsomme Instructions to dyrecte oure lyues, ney∣neyther
ought we to be soscrupulous or ful of curiositie As eyther to condemne or mislike the pleasaunt comodye for that it is not painted with ye serenety of the Stoickes, seing the volumes of prophaned records, & scripture it self do note vnto vs the lyues of sundre vicious parsons, not for that we shoulde enter into tearmes of grudge againste the rea∣port of suche auncient antiquitie, nor dispose our selues to the imitation of the like vices, but rather in vewynge the strange and greuous punishment whiche ordinarily hath ouerwhelmed suche sin, to learne and labor to directe our lyues by the contrary of their examples, whiche is one re∣specte that made me put my penne in exercise to prefer this historie to our vulgar tonge, to thend also that the frayle youth of our countrie, that folowe the damnable path of iniquitie, maye sée howe sewer they are to féele the heauye hand of God, who bles∣seth the good sorte wyth a plen∣tyfull gyft of his grace, and punisheth the wycked with sundrye sortes of affli∣ction. FINIS.
The argument WE sholde not neede so muche thassis∣tance of foreine recordes, nor reporte of aunciente histories excedinge the compase of our age and memorie, if we were as carefull to note thaccy∣dentes of our own time, as we seame curious in admiracion of rare things whose glorious antiquitie with parcialitie of fame, set∣tes a more price of thindeuor of others, thē their diligence & doings deserue by iustice, like as the grekes and romans painting with an exquisitedexteritie of ye pen, their pollicy in warr, the valiantnes of their Captaines, their wonder∣full fortune and good successe in all enterprises, with other discourses of their vertues, do argue them more glorious in their owne acts, then meritorious in deade of true com∣mendacion, for that in arrogatinge vnto themselues the only title and name of all knowledge, they make our time seme naked of all vertue, sauinge such as is deriued from theim and ymytacion of their doings. Albeit we maye obiect with the spartayne agaynste thathenians, that those lippwise soldiours or scoole orators, had a more facilitie in discouering, then facylitie in execucion of noble effects: not for that I meane to do such wrong to their estimacion, as not to yelde to theim a title of singularitie in all perfecti∣ons, yet I may also be bould to preferr the benefit of oure time which participating wyth their golden age in any res¦pect of honest gift or qualitie, is hable to presēt a furniture of as many examples and authorities of vertue as we rede were found in the politike state of Rome when Cato, Ca∣milla, or Scipio, gouerned that proude Citye, or when on Pericles, Themistocles or Aristides bare authoritie in the
florishinge Acadimia, of Athens, for if we go about to dis∣course of the valyantnes in armes, or stody to be pryuy to ye sleightes and pollecy in warr, we nede not thassistance of one Hannybal, discipline of Marius, pellecy of Pompeius nor corage of Cesar or Alexander, seing our fertile Evropa brings furth such store of excellent captaines, that if those great couqwerours and subuertors of whole countries a∣mongs the Grekes and Romains, wer now in the feilde with their invincible force, they should not finde a mettel∣lus orgalozs without armes, nor encounter a company of effemynate Persyans, or haue to do with serfull Italyans but they shold buckle wyth the valiant cauelery and gen∣darmy of fraunce, fele the force of the couragious english∣men, make a proofe of the puisance of the mightie Al∣maine, and make heade agaynst the armes of the loftie Spanyarde, wherein as the shortnes of time denieth me to yelde to euerye captein, and souldiour his peculyar com∣mendacion, so my endeuor could not escape without ympu tacion of superfluitie, if I shold enterlard my Catalogue of the gracious gifts of our tyme, withe the due glorye of the fathers of iustice, deuising wonderful pollicyes and ne¦cessarye Lawes for regarde of the publike weale in the se∣nate, wherein our world I thinke oweth nothinge to an∣tiquitie, neyther neede I preferr the singularitie and exqui∣site skil of oure payntors or forgers of curious ymages, whose arte at this daye contendes wythe the aunciente conninge of Appelles Albeit vppon the commendacions of these dexterities in armes, and arts cōcerning ye hands, I find attendinge a worthie cause of generall complaynte agaynst the slowthfulnes of our tyme, geuinge wyth al the
title of iuste prayse to the diligence of thauncyentes, who preseruing the memory of such as deserued reuowme amō¦genst them for any vertue, hath left vs cause to blush in our owne abuses, and be ashamed of the negligence we vse in recording the rarietyes of our time or perfections of suche as are iustly meritorious of prayse, and albeit of long time thiniquitie of the bad sort of men, haue so much preuailed ouer the worthie renowne of vertuous women, that they haue not sticked to whet their malicious tongues, with di¦uerse blasphemous reproches agaynst such as by misfor∣tune haue geuen som salfe bownd to their honor, yet ought we not to be vnthanckful to the chastetie and honest con∣uersacion of the rest, who rather then they wold departe wyth the badge of their pudycitie, haue bene sene with their bodyes full of wounds, and faces died with blode, and sometime passed the panges of painfull death, in resistinge the force and fleshely vylanye of the wicked corrupters of the virginitie, wherin if the Goekes aue geuen such great comendacion to the faire Hippo, who being made a pray amongest other spoyles of ye countrey to a barbarous pirott on the sea, with present daunger to depart wyth the badge of her honor, chused rather to bury her body, in the belly of some fyshe, and consecrat her integrytie to the waues, then suffer an insydell pallyard to hurt her soule to the deathe in depryuinge her of that, which all the worlde are not a∣ble to restore or make good: if the Boecyans haue not for∣got to engraue in pillors of eternetye, the memorye of a Ladye in Thebes, who forced to the vyolacion of her bo∣dye by a rude souldiour oft he Kynge of the macedonions dissimuled for the time her dystres wyth fayned showes, that she delyted in the pleasure, til, encountringe at laste
a conuenient occasion, she reuenged the wronge done to her honor with the death of him that had vsed such force agaynst her, where also, herself loathing the vse of longer yeares, hauing already lost the onlye ioye and felicitie in lyfe, gaue place to nature, and at thinstanct made a blody sacryfice of herself by her own hands, And if the Romains haue had alwayes in their mouthe the prayse of Lucrese whose chastetie they haue placed in the theatrye or circle of Mars, and geuen her a chiefe place amonges the trains of the chast Diana, if all these I say haue bene so thankfull to the vertuouse womē of their time, that by their diligence the memorye of their vertue remaineth in recorde to the posteritie of all ages, what worthie cause of rebuke haue we, who lyuyng vnder a better clymat and constellacion, enioying more pure lawes, and aspiring nerer thymage or semblaunce of dyuynitie, will not erpose the noble frutes of our tyme, whyche yeldes not onely example of sembla ble vertue to thauncientes, but excedes them in contynent lyuinge and chast disposicion, wherof we haue an example of Yphygenne doughter of ye kyng of Ethiopia, who hauyng already vowed her vyrginitie to the spouse of oure soules accepted rather the offer of present deathe, then to be ioy∣ned in Mariage to a wanton younge prince (prouyded for her by her father) with a nomber of lyke autho∣rities which I colde infer to proue the sinceritie of womē, who at the beginning, when our religion was first founded did lay the cornerstone of puretie without hauing ye know∣ledge of man: neyther is our age so voide of examples of contynency, nor the roote of vertue so cleane extirped from amongest vs, but we maye se at this day sundry pattorns of pudycitye in the persons of all degres of women, aswel
noble as of meaner condicion, exceding the vertue of such as antiquitie hath in so great veneraion: wherin for a fami¦liar reuenge of our Ladyes now a dayes touching the sy∣nyster ympositions of dyuers euil tongues inveighinge a∣gaynst the whole sect, I haue presented hereupō the stage this historie taken out of Italyon, whose authoritie as it is sufficient to answere the combate agaynste the wicked chalengors of the vndefiled honor of the sacred sect femy∣nyne, so the discourse is able to moue compassion to the hartes of men participatiug with nobilitie, and set abroach the conduites of teares in the eyes of such Ladyes and gen¦tlewomen, as take more pleasure to preserue in eutyer the Iewel of their honor, then to open their eares to ye charme of the vaine Louer, passioned as be fayneth, for a bewtye that passeth with the morning dewe, importinge also more cause of admiracion, as the person (in whom thaccident is veryfied) is of simple estate, for that the higher she is in de∣gre, the more care ought she to haue of her honor, exposing arguments and effects of vertu to the meaner sort, lyke as the torch or Hemispher starr, geueth lyght to the lytle can∣del and element of lesse substance: I wish the young ladies and damesells of our countrye would painte this table in their harts, and with the vertue and ymytacion of her chas¦tity, fortesye them selues agaynst the pepred allurmēts of the crafty souler, who makes warr against their honor vn∣der thensigne of the blind captein Cupid, and directed by ye guide of folly, and not by example of her deathe to force an vntymely and vnnaturall destynie, or end of their dayes.
IVLYA DROVVNETH her selfe for that her bodye was abused by force. YT nede not seme doubtfuli to anye at this day, that GaZolo, is percel of the duke dom of Mantua, planted in a most plesāt solie right ouer agaynst the father of flod¦des sometime called Iryden and nowe beringe the name of. PO. whose sundry brookes, deuided into diuerse streames and pleasant chanells, norisheth by their moistures the whole contrey of Italy, like as also it is of no lesse credite, that wythin our time and memorie, ther was borne and bred vpp in the same towne, a mayde called Iulya, whome, if fortune had preferred to the title of a princes or greate Ladye, whereby her vertues mighte haue bone brought in reputacion by authoritie of high estate, like as her godly order and chast conuersacion of lyfe, made her name famous, she might haue serued (no doubt) as ye only lanterne to geue lyght to al degres of youthe in our age: her father was not made of so meane a molde, for hys birthe, as attended vpon with continuall pouerty, hauinge only for his porcion, the assistance and trauaile of his hands to susteine himself & famylie, wherin albeit necessitie (being ye most greuouse scourge of mans lyfe) pincheth cōmōly so ex¦tremelie, that she makes vs manye tymes forget both honor, honestie, and good order, Ye and abuse the goodnes of our nature, yet shall you fynd some, so whollie resolued in ver∣tue, & stād so sewerly vpon the guarde of their honest name, That rather then the hungry rage of pouertie, or gnawing

euill, then careful to preuent all occasions of the same, wold not admit any dispense or abstinence of trauaile, sauynge of the hollydaies which she vsed as seasons of honest recreaciō in the open feldes amongest other her cōpagniōs, detestyng vnlauful haunts and secret chattinge with men in corners, the chefest meane to bryng their name and doynge in que∣stion, for she that abandoneth the companie of her compani∣ons, forsakinge the place of publike assembly, to retire into the desolate and darke corners of the chamber, doth not only bryng her doyngs in doute, but also settes the sclanderer of worke, to forge a thousand informacions against her former title & name of honestie, how clere and strong so euer it sea∣med in the iudgment of all the world, and what other opiniō ys to be had of her, that delites in secret conference, hatyng to haue her sayngs procede in publike, then that shée treates of other affayers then she may wel iustifie, for if she liued as she ought, & vsed none other tearmes then were to be aduou∣ched, she neade neither feare ye creaking of ye dore, nor vse ob∣scure & darke vaults as only witnesses of her talke, wherof I could enlarg the proff with authoritie of antiquitie, yf the misery of our present time, did not prefer examples sufficiēt, which I wish may so instructe ye careles mothers of Englād, that keping their doughters within the awe of correction, they make thē also subiecte to the lawe & order of good go∣uernemēt, least both the one & the other, become the wōder of ye multitude, & cause of folysh enterluds deuised on publicke stage by the like occasions, but now to our Iulya, whose chast & vpright order of lyuing, being yet fresh within the memo∣rie of our age, & not to be defaced with the lengthe of tyme, serues also as a line to lead you yong Ladies, to direct your liues (as nere as you can) by the dyall of her vertues: for she treading thus both the stepps of honest traueile, & traded in the path of true perfection of life, deuided the wéeke into dailie exercises of toile, and necessary affayers of her father, spending the holy dayes only in honest recreacion amonge semely companie in the churche yarde or other conuenient
place of publicke assemblie, wher being vnhappely spied of a detestable palliard & common enemy of the honor of women, was sodenly sōmoned by the sentence of her destines, & fell by no lesse misfortune, into ye dāger of a fleshly louer, for at ye same instant, the noble Loys gonsaga thē byshop of the douchy of Mantua, kept his residence at Gazolo, where amongest hys traine of houshold gentlemen ther was one, who seruyng the byshop in the office of a vallet of his chamber, hadd bene no lesse worthye of the credite of that rowmthe, then of gre∣ter preferment at the hāds of his maister, if he had not byn vnhappely encoūtered by the desaster which this history pre sēts vnto you: but what? a small spot staines a faier garmēt, and one vice that is detestable darkneth the credit of a nōber of vertues, it is to be noted (as I haue said) yt in Italye ye mée∣ting of youth & daunsing is tollerable, so it be in the viewe & eye of the people, but whatsoeuer other men do thincke of ye art of daunsing, I am perswaded that it is rather a discipline deuised within the scoole of Sathan, then an exercyse mete to encourage youth to thimitaciō of vertue wherin I appeale to iustifie my opinion, to the frute & effectes appearing daily in that lasciuius trade, & leuing a parte the inuectiues and infi∣nite examples which the histories on both partes do infer in detestacion of that wantō allurment or prouocation to sin, I thought it sufficiēt to confirme my aduise only wt the autho∣ritie of the Romaine, who diswading al men from the exercise of daunsing, saith that the countenaunce, gestes and other behauyors of a daunser, do nothinge differ from the order & disposicion of a foole: here this valet of chaūber to ye byshop, being vnhappelie presēt in an assēbly of youth, espied by the like milfortune, the order & behauior of Iulia, who albeit, she was ye porest of the cōpanie, yet was she nothing inferior to ye best in semely grace and womanly order appearing in her during ye time of the daunce, which infectyng alredy the eies of the gallād of FERRARA, moued him also wt present desier to go nere & take a better view of her beautie, which he was not hable to cōsider wt such iudgmēt & assured stay of him self
but the glymering complexion of her face dyed wt a natural coolor of white and red, made suche a breache into his harte, that wearing the picture of her beautie in the botome of the same, proclaimed her, without further aduise, yt soueraygne Lady of hys lyfe, and only mysters and ruler of hys though∣tes, and aduowing herewt to yeald her the whole honor of his seruice, protested in secrett to himselfe, with lyke vowe and ceremonye of vayne conceyte, not to leue the pursute of suche a praye, till he had made a conquest of that he yma∣gined, and encountred theffect of his desyre, by wearyng the garland of the flower and firste frutes of the maidenhedd of IVLYA, whom because he stode on thornes til he had presen∣ted the firste ernest penie of his seruice, he requested too daunce, whyche not knowynge the cause of hys courtesye, she refused not to doe, as one no lesse redy too performe all requests and affayres of cyuilitie and good bringing vp, ac∣cordynge to her callynge, then excellyng all the reste of her tyme in beautie and other vertues without exception, but yf this fonde younglynge and pupill of CVPIDO dyd féele afore, the symple mocions of loue, beginnyng too tickle him but with desyre onelye to vewe her at large, yt is nowe that he resygned hymselfe wholy into the daunger of hym who as a subtill serpent, lyeth in wayte to inuade them Loue. whome he fyndes vnarmed with vertue, laughynge af∣terwarde to hym selfe at oure redynes to lysten to the lure of hys bayte, and ronne hedlonge into the laborynthe of endles dysquyet, and that whyche brought more oyle to hys matche, and kyndled in hys harte the present spar∣kes of hoat affection, was, when he felt the tendernes of her hande, whiche albeit was euery daye dipped in dyuers vnholsom confections, and alwayes bare, tabide the violence of the wether, not refrayninge the hardnes or hard labour of any toyle, reteyned suche a dilicate softnes and naturall hewe of it selfe, that it seamed equall (for the fynes & smoth∣nes of skyn) to some Ladyes which I know) are assisted with the helpe of waters and lée made for the nonce, and other
legerdemeins deuised by the potticarye, to preserue their handes, in a continual moysture with a fyne whyte & plea∣sant show The plesant reflection of her ladylike hand, which durynge the daunce he fayled not too graspe as often as hée durst, gaue suche encrese to the warre alredy begon, renew∣inge the combate of his thoughtes with suche fresh supplies of affection, that he found himselfe so much to weake to men∣teine warr with one of the gretest lordes of the world, that geuing place to his present fortune, he resigned the fortresse of his former quiet, and became prisoner to him, who wolde not be content with any other ransome, then the losse of his libertie duringe his plesure: and albeit the poore gentleman (felinge to great an extremytie in this first passion) woulde gladly haue resigned his preferment & not pursewed the se∣quele or folowe the chase, yet whether it were ye smale expe∣rience he had in the skole of loue, or the angrye dome of hys destinies, that wolde not dismisse him without the rewarde of his follie, or whether the foggy myste of founde affection, hadd so séeled the eyes of his mynde, that he sawe hymselfe, denied the assistance of any meane to redeme him from the yoke of his newe bondage, or what yt was, the sequele of his yll fortune, maye argue sufficiently hys follie, but wel I knowe, that for a disease of so straunge disposicion, he lacked his necessarye medycine, beyng no lesse deceyued in the cre∣dite of his owne wytt, in sekynge to quenche and mortifie the fyre alredy burst out into flame, by geuinge skope to hys eye, to féede contynually vppon her, whom he knowes to bée the cause of his grefe, neyther dyd he other good to him selfe then caste water vppon hoat coales, dobling the rage of hys affection, by the desire he had to be contynually in her com∣panye, he ought rather to haue abandoned the place with the presence of his enemye at the very first alaram and of∣fer of thassault, dismissinge the remembrance of her beautie affore it made any breach in his harte, for he that is vnhap∣pely fallen into the danger of loue, must not kepe war with the remembrance of her, that hath enchaunted him, nor pur
sewe the viewe of her beautye with a continuall gaze or re∣gard of his eye, but rather eschewing the place & presence of his mystris (two cōmon enemies to his quiet) seke to subdue the rage of his passion with longe absence and far distance of his aboad, wherein he muste seme so precise to cure so strange a disease, that yf vnhappely he come within the aier of the place wher she is, he stand so suerly vpon his guarde, that she once glaunce not vpon him with a glimeryng som∣monce of her flattteringe eye, consideryng that in the verey eye and looke of a woman, doth lurke an infection of suche drawyng vertue, that one simple obiect or glance of ye same, being sufficient to pearce thorowe ye armour of his resistāce, is also hable to bringe him eftesones vnder the yoke of her awe, But this foolish Ferrarois rather resolued in his euil, and contented with his choise, then desierous to retire in time, or hable (as it semed) to shōne the peril of ye losse of his liber∣tye, gaue place to his present fortune, & entred the listes, as thrall or captiue to the beauty of Iulya, with whō after thend of ii. or iij. daunces, he began to deuise & discourse of loue in this sorte: yf the record of diuerse histories of old time, toge∣ther The gētlemā maketh loue to Iulya. wt the present viewe of sondry familiar exāples at this daie, did not so amply describe the power of loue, & partly in∣structe me touching his order & disposition. I sholde seme no lesse amased at the mistery of his traūce, then I feele my self vnhappely encountred with the messenger of his behest, and iustely (me thincke) may we commence complaint against nature, who framing vs of a brickel & delicat mettall, made vs rather incident & apte to incur euery danger of the fleshe & peril of temptaciō, then armed vs with choise of meanes to resiste the ordinary assaultes of the world, wherof (saieth he) I may exclaime wyth good aucthoritie aboue the rest, seinge that since ye viewe of your presence in this place I am fallen into the prooffe of the like perill: for as I haue hetherto en∣ioyed the benefit of a moste pleasant libertye, beinge no lesse froo from all assaults of fond affection, then voide to desier to commend my seruice to the best Lady of them all, So synce
my gredye and vnhappye eyes seased with suche assurance vpon your beautye, takynge with large viewe, the ful mea∣sure of al your parts, & making present report therof to my hart & other the inward parts of me, I haue susteined suche hoate alarams betwene my libertie & desyer to do you ser∣uice, that beinge no lenger hable to restore the feighte for want of fresh supplies, am here cōme vnder your lée, presen∣ting my selfe the prisoner of your beautie, wherin albeit, I can not by any merite of mine owne, craue an expedicion of fauour by iustice, yet do I not dispaier that you will sus∣pend my deliuery, seing my passion is of no lesse importāce then either thabridgemēt or prolōging of my lif, persuading my self with this special comfort, that vnder the vaile of so rare a beautie, ther can not lurke any disposiciō of lōg cru∣eltie: but she detesting no less his pepered persuacions, then loathinge to spend longe time in so vaine an argument, re∣plied no lesse wyselye then with tearmes of vertue, measu∣ring her answer with the shortnes of tyme she ment to de∣uise wyth him: it is hard syr (saith she) to iudge a difference Iulya ansvve∣reth. betwene your vnsemelye discurtesye, and the argument of your present follye, seinge both the one and the other im∣porte a semblable meaning of dishonestye, neyther are they bothe voide of equall reproche to your owne estimacion. And albeit your indeuor in suche affaires ought not be an∣swered but with termes of publike exclamaciō, to thend the office of infamous sklanders might yealde you the worthie rewarde of youre trauaill, yet because the punishement of shame for this one offence, shall not take awaye the hope of amendement & future grace in you, I am content to make counsell of the faulte, and dismiss you wyth frée forgeuenes of the facte, wherin as the remembraunce of your example shall hensfurth warne me, to take hede to the subtyll char∣mes of other, not differynge from you in disposition, so let it suffice you, that I make scilence of your offence, without other rebuke to so greate a disorder, wyth this further re∣quest, that this gentill repulse may rather importe a credit to my vertue, than prouoke you eftesones to geue the lyke
charge of mine honour, whiche I hold no lesse dere, then the greatest Lady of our countrey, neyther shall you fynde my chastetye lesse pure then my pouertye vertuouse, whiche al∣beit made the galland somewhat amased for the tyme, yet as a valyant souldyor, that will not leue the assaulte for one repulse gaue a seconde charge wyth these tearmes, yf you seame in this sorte to prononce the sentence of my death, (saith he) and suffer your crueltie to cōmit me to the handes of fatall execucion, the worlde wil note you a monster and enemy to nature, and God sewer, wil cal for a reackonning of so foule and cruel an acte: the malice of the worlde (saith she) is not so greate nor parciall in this respecte, as to yelde me infamy in defendynge mine honour, & nature is abused when we lose so precious a gyfte, and touchinge any ac∣compte to make afore God, I thincke my soule shall stande in more daunger in condescendyng to your request, then yf you wylfullye dye by your owne follye, wherefore I aduise you, for ende, to gyue ouer the pursute of so vaine au en∣terprise, and séeke to bestowe your trauail, wher ther is hope of better successe, and amongest suche, as makyng a cōmon marchandise of their honour, will not stick to set it of sale to suche as bid most for it, for my part, I am no lesse Ielouse of myne honesty, then carefull to kepe in entyer the name of my poore parentes, neyther shall mine honour be sould for other valewe, then the price of my lyfe, whiche laste wordes albeit, argued to the gentleman a great vnlikelihood to come to the effecte of his desire, wyth no less impossibili∣tie to shake the fortresse of her chastetye or make a breache into a castell of so valyaunt defence, yet woulde not he for all that, geue place to dispare, but retiryng to thassistance of a newe deuise, he learned the common haunte of his my∣stris goinge and comming from the feelde, as occasion of her busines did cal her, wher he metīg her, more oftē thē he was welcome, forgott not eftesones to commend vnto her the remēbrance of his cause, with a redresse of his grefe, hoping with the helpe of his importunitie, and assistaunce of tyme
to remoue yt stone frō her stomake, & procure a pleasāt thawe to the frozen harte of this pore cotier, wherin he gayned no lesse then if he had spent so much time in nombring the smal sands that couers the deserts of Arabia, in so much that she willed him nowe for all, to rest cōtēted with that he had don, and presse her no further, for (saith she) so longe as my soule and body shal kepe house together, I will make such a Iewel of myne honour, that there shal neuer friuolous louer haue interest or authoritie, to dispose of it, neither wil I geue so large a skoape or libertie to my vnruly affections, as the pre cious flower of my chastetye shalbe a praye, or at the dispo∣sition of any, but such as it shall please thalmightie to ioyne with me in mariage, wherfore go open the packe of your tromperie in a market cōuenient for your purpose, & consi∣der your callynge wyth the profession of your maister, who ought to traine you in such sorte, as you may rather appeare true patterns and ymages of vertue, then ministers of kna∣uery, sekyng to seduce poore maides of the contrey, who ly∣uynge in the feare of God with no lesse care of their honest name, ought not to listen to the lure of loue, or kepe vayne chat with companions lyke to your selfe, but folowyng the discipline of vertue, to susteine oure honest pouertye wyth the trauaile of oure handes, whiche is the porcion, ap∣pointed God. to vs by him, whome I beseche so mortifie this rage of your follye, that hereafter I may lyue in peace, and se you restored to the vse of your former sences, but he being none other then the slaue of follye, disposed whollye to féede vpon the humour of his affections, had no other thought then to deuise howe to enioye the firste frutes and pleasant iewiste of the virginity of chaste Iulya, who the lesse accōpte, she sea∣med to make of his gréef, the greater grewe his desir to pur∣sue her, whiche he failed not still to performe with more ve∣hemencie then afore, publishyng his affection by the sounde of a nomber of doleful sighes, accompanied wyth teares, of suche pitiful regarde, that they seamed sufficient to pearce a hart wroughte on the forge of flinte or stéele.
But who is hable to corrupt the chastetie ofher that hath her harte armed with assurance in vertue? or what is he that ey∣ther with the smoth stile of his pleasant tounge, or suttletye in sleintes and fine deuises or other legerdemeins of folly, can make so strong a charme to enchaunt the constancye of a womā resolued in the feare of god, wt desire to were a crown of ymortalitie by the renowme of her honest lyfe, but it is to be resisted by a speciall confidence in god and assurance in her vertu: the pure and holly virgins in time past whose names be registred in the booke of fame, haue not they byn strong∣ly assailed? wyth semblable assaltes and yet wythout shott or shed of blodde they haue preuailed aboue the malice of theym yt vndertoke to rob them of ye euerlasting glory of their vir∣ginitie, & suerly there is no malyce of mā so great, nor deuise so detestable, that stands not in awe and stowpes in the pre∣sence of true vertu, neyther can it pearce and much lesse pos sesse any hart, but that which he fyndes vnarmed of a faithe & fere in god, who wil neyther suffer his seruant to be tempted aboue his power, nor see him oppressed long with the malice of ye wicked. Here may the slaunderer haue wherwith to stop his mouth and be brought to beleue by famyliar proofe, that vertuouse women haue better meanes to resist the veine im¦portunities of loue, thē the wicked and euil disposed haue rea¦son to seke to seduce the honor of their chastitie, and if by des tenye or ill fortune it happen that some one forget her selfs so far, that she falls vnhappely into the daunger of the temp∣tor, let her falte and shame be peculiar to herselfe and not staine the rest wyth the reproche of her follye, for it is no rea son that when any thinge chaunceth amys, all menne be∣come giltie of the falte, no more then when one man among a nomber, incident to the like desaster, becoms a thefe or the worker of some other haynous offence, ought to infect other with thinfamy due to him selfe, or ympart the penance of the fact amōgest other that himself only deserueth, for na∣ture makynge vs all of one mettell, hathe geuen vs indif∣ferentlye

And for your parte beinge no lesse fortunat then the best of any age heretofore, and honored with no lesse true affection then duetyful seruice of one that is redye to pawne hys lyuynge, honor and all that he hath for the interest of your good wyll, I meruaile you re∣gard so lyghtlye the rewarde of so greate a vertue, and vse so small care in curyng your owne disease, which because you dare not declare, doth make a secrett martirdome of your florishyng youth: albeit for ende, yf you wyll willyng∣lye embrace the gyfte of present tyme, and vse mine ad∣uise in the pursuete of your pleasure and commodytye, I doubte not within lesse then a moment; to restore you to treble contentement of mynde, relyue the nedefull pouertye of your parents, and make you excede the reste of your neyghbours in authoritye and estimation, But IVLIA no lesse gladd to here an ende of this pernicious

wyth all offers of curtesie, I cannot thyncke, but it ys some hard rocke conuerted in the shappe of a woman or fygure of beautie, to become the tyrranouse tormenter of them that vnhappely are sommoned to serue her, wherfore seing I am denied to assist you by my trauaile, accordynge to my pro∣myse, I praye you lett me aduise you to stoppe the course of affection, and choke the chanell of your loue affore yt ouer∣flowe the hope of recouery, and cease any longer to féede the humor of your passion with the remembrance of her, that se∣mes to take pleasure in youre gryef: well well sayth the do∣lorous louer, I woulde I coulde as easely forget, as you are apte to perswad, or that you had thusmuch aduised me afore you gaue me assuraunce of relyef by youre dylygence, but chyefly I wish that I hadd eschued the yll when I admitted the cause, then had I reserued my lybertye, liued free from passion, voyd from vnacquainted ertremyties, and not lamēt to late in thys sort, myne owne disaster, nor stande neadē to communicate wyth you who selleth youre aduise for money and makes youre trauayle the marchaunt of fylthye gaine, albeyt seynge want of discresion hath styrred vp this error, and the folly of youth preuayled aboue the force of wisdom, I muste be dryuen to make of necessytye a lawe, and geue place to ye sentēce of my presēt fortune, greuing not withstā¦dynge that the frendshyppe and vndouted zeale of affection which I bare her, shold reape the fruts of rigour and receue the meryite of their vertue at the handes of crueltie: at the least I wil not so dispair but that the argument of a future hope shall kepe me in breathe, and expectyng the benefytt of a better time, I wil comitt my selfe to the gouerment of pa∣cience, who as I haue harde is the onely tuche stone to trye a man that ys fallen into termes of affliction. But here the galland semed rather to féede the tyme, then bynd himselfe to performe theffecte of his owne wordes, neyther mente he to suffer hys last resolution to passe for currant money & muche lesse to content hym selfe with his cardes, seyng he lyked not his game, and seing he colde not preuaile by polli∣cye

do mordore, only saye they, we are com hither to bend you by force that will not bow by any entreatye, wherefore if you thincke you haue any wronge, referr the cause to the longe contynuance of your crueltie, which is now at point to be re∣uenged: pytty it was to heare the dolorous tunes of the poore maide, with the miserable skrikes which she thrue vpp into the ayre to witnes her innocencye, wherein shee contynued wythout any eccho of reschewe, til ye detestable pallyard had spoyled the flower of her virginitie, and then he begā to per∣swade her to pacyēce, willing her her eafter not to become so Iulya raui∣shed by force curious of her chastitie nor refuce to admit ye offer of his frēd¦shipp, wherof he promised so largly that (if she wold) he wold take her from her father and kepe her at his charges, presen¦ting at thinstāt a purse ful of money, willing her thensfurth to caste awaye all cause of care, and dispose her selfe onlye to cherishe and make much of the rest of her life, for the whiche saith he, you shal fynde me as careful as you shal thinke con∣ueniēt and if hereafter you haue a desyre to mary, doubt not to repose your selfe therin vpon me, for I wil so wel prouide and assiste you wyth so good a porcion, that the same shalbe plentifull inoughe to susteine you, and releue the needfull condicion of your parentes: but she no lesse loathing the of∣fer of his filthy promise, then detesting the villen that wold not cease yet to corrupt her, hauinge by this time recouered Money the ministers o infection. her sences, defyed him wyth his mynisters of infection, sa∣ing that although his villeny & force hath defiled the chastitie of her body and geuen him theffecte of his lasciuious desier, yet shold he neuer be hable eyther wyth his money or other wayes, to corrupt the sincerytie of her hart, whose innocen∣cye saith she, wyl tryumphe ouer thy execrable acte afore him who is to yelde the the due hyer of thy trauaile: is it in thy po¦wer to satisfie or leue me cōtented, yt frō me which al yt world cānot eftsones restore me? No no it is god of whō I must claime satisfactiō in punishing ye two trayterous Borre ans and rauenous spoilers of ye virginitie of me pore wretch who was borne to abyde ye setence of my destinye, ye galland
thinckyng to appease thextremitie of her passion, began to prefer perswacions of cōfort, which she defied with such spite and bitter termes of iust reproche against him, that lothyng to suffer her eyes to féede vppon him that had infected all the partes of her body, tolde him that the only veiwe of his villa∣nous lookes made her forgett all order of pacience, which he toke as a comission to depart, fearyng withal yt the noyse of her cōplaints might, bechaūce com to ye eares of som that pas∣sed ye way who vnderstandyng the discourse of the rape, wold make reporte to the bishop whose profession and othe is che∣felye to punishe offendours in the like accydentes: here the sorowful IVLIA being void of companie sauyng the doleful ecchoes of woodes and ryuers that answered her cryes wyth lyke complaint, renewes the warre of her present desaster which tearing her heares without respecte, and quarellyng with ye dowery that nature had gyuen her wold gladly haue Beautie. touched her with ymputacion in makyng her incydent to so wretched a destenye, in exclaiming still vppon the malice of her Fortune, yf thabundaunce of teares accompayned wyth sighs of pytyfull disposicion, hadd not so stopped the course of speche, that for the time she was dryuen into scilence, and beyng by litte and litle restored againe to the libertie of her tounge, and the source of her sorrowe somewhat retyred, she made a short inuocacion to God in this sorte, oh heuenlye father sayeth she, I sée that the rigour of thy iustice, hath pre¦uailed aboue the benefytt of thy mercie, and that thou doste awarde me this harde penaunce for the punyshment of my faltes passed, wt what face alas shal I behold my poore father whose compfort as it consisted in my wel doing, so his gréefe wilbe without comparison, hering of the hard termes of my myschaunce, in desolacion shal he knitt vpp the remeynder of his olde yeres that commyng into any place, the remem∣braūce of my falte drawing the blood of shame into his face will make him blushe and eschewe the companye, wher afor he neded not haue douted to haue marched amōgest the best, and shall I dissemble that whyche I entende not to hydd or
kepe it secret that toucheth me so nere, No, no, as thin∣cencye of my mynde is recorded afore god, so because the world shall also witnes how clere I was from consente, I wil vse no other water to washe away so great a spott then the sacryfice of death, which I will followe with no lesse ex∣pedicion, then the treason of the villaine hath bene cruel in takinge from me that whyche made me to lyue, wherwithe dismissing her complaint, she ceassed also frō teares and put herselfe in order to go to the house of her father, who (by e∣uill ucke) was not then at home: there she puts on the beste garment she had, and attyring her self in order to go to some great méeting or banquet, shittes the doare of her cotage, and leading her yonger syster in her hād, went furthwith to an awnt of hers, who as one ouercharged with sicknes and yeres, was not hable to sturr out of her bedd, affore whome as she was in the middest of the repeticion of her chaunce reueiling the whole order and circumstance of the fact, which she cold not do without great effusion of teares, for that the very remembrance of the deede restored a freshe alaram of her sorowes, she fel sodeinly into a qualme or passion of soun¦dyng, wherein she remayned traunced wythout all argu∣ment of lyfe, til by the helpe of the assistāce, she was eftsones delyuered to thuse and libertie of her senses, when quarel∣ling stil wt the horror of the fact, & desire to be reuenged by death, she seamed to rebuke her owne ymbecillitie and faint∣nes of corage, saing, what signe of vertu is this to seame to shrink, when argumēts of constancy ought chiefly tappere? who wyll desire to lyue, that hath lost the renoume of honor which ought to be the most precious Iewel and badge of the lyfe, or what pleasure is it to possesse the presence of the body alredy spotted with infamye, when the soule, wery of her ha∣bytaciō, is redy to resigne her auncyent aboade? what felici∣tie haue they in lyfe, that being the gaze and wonder of the multytude, cannot claime the priuiledge of any place, but the people wyl point at them? neyther can they hyde theym in so
secret a corner, but infamye wyll hunt them out, & shame discouer them, attēding them to the very end of theyr daies, no, no, let not them lyue that are desirous to dye, and death is moste acceptable to suche, as hate the fruicion of lyfe: for my parte, I loth alredy the remembrance of lyfe, seing I haue lost the chefest pillor of the same, wherof I meane to make spedy declaracion by the sentence I haue alredy pro∣nounced of my ende, wherin it shall appeare to the worlde, that although my bodye haue tasted of the malice of the wic∣ked by force, yet my mynde remains entire without spott or consentement to the villany, whiche as my chiefe bequeste and last testament in this worlde, I leue registred in the re∣membrance of you good awnt, to make relacion to my deso∣lat parents and the whole worlde besides, of thaccidēt of my wretched desaster, & that although your vnhappy néece and miserable IVLIA hath by meare force, lost the outward show of her honor, yet her conscience remeinyng vnspotted, and soule cleare, ready to flye to the heauēs to witnes her ītegry tye afore the sacred theatrye or tribunall seate of GOD, can not departe wyth worthye contentement, afore I offer my lyf to ye waues, to purifie the fylthye spottes wherewith my bodye remeins painted on all parts by thinfection of the detestable rape of force, wherewith she departed, not tary∣inge the replye of her awnt, who thoughte to haue diswaded her from the pursuete of her desperate intent, and beinge cōme to the riuer of Oglyo, kyssing her sister, with a last crye to god to receyue her soule to his mercy, she lept hedlōg into Iuly a drovv∣neth her selfe the water, who as a mercyles element, respectinge neyther thinnocency of her cause, nor desperate order of dying, com∣mitted her to the botomles throts & goolphes of the sourges, whiche was the ende of this miserable IVLIA, whose lyfe only deserues commendation for thexample of her vertue, and deathe worthie to be committed to oblyuyon for the signes of desperacion wherewyth it was infected. But after this chaunce burst out into tearmes, & became the report of the people, God knoweth what generall desolacion was
amonge all the estate of the Cytie, aswell for the strangnes of the facte, as for that the villeyne was fledd that caused the brute, who if he had ben taken, had don penance of this falte with the losse of his lyfe in example of others: the bodye was founde by the diligence of Loys Gonzaga, who woulde not suffer it to be buryed in the Churche yarde or other san∣ctuarye, because of the desperat maner of her death, but cau∣sed it to be solempnelye accōpanyed with the teares & great dule of diuerse Ladyes into a place or graue in the felde, where he ment in shorte tyme to sett vpp a tombe of marble wyth a monument of the particular discourse of the ver∣tues and singuler gyftes of grace in his pore countrewomā, whose death I wishe may learne al estats to eschewe the pe∣rill of dispaier, and order of lyfe to instructe all the yonge Ladyes of England, to resiste the charmes and sugred allu∣rements of loue, who the more he is feasted with pleasaunt regardes of the eye, or encountred with secret conference in corners, or courted wyth embassages, or lastlye banqueted wyth dishes of delicate toyes or vaine importunityes, the more is he redye to inuade and apte to ouercome, but on the contrarye parte, the waye to kepe warre wyth that vacca∣bound, and to flée his infections, is (as IVLIA did) to marche against hym with a flagge of vertue, vsyng wythall, the pol∣lycy of VLIXES in stopping your eares from the pepered harmonye of them, that delitinge only in the praye of your outwarde beautye, haue no respecte to the ornament of the soule, whiche beinge kepte pure and vndefyled to thende, yealdes you a rewarde of immortalitye, and your renowme neuer to be rased out of remem∣braunce, tyll thextreame disso∣lucion of the worlde. FINIS.
The argument. THere was neuer mischiefe of former time, nor vice in present vse, wherein men are, or haue bene more drowned, or drawen by a beastly desyer, then in therecrable and deadly synne of whore∣dome, by the which besides that, the spi¦rituall fornicacion is figured in some sorte, yet is it forbidden vnto vs expresly by thinuiolable lawes, not written in the tables, wher thauncientes were wonte to graue directions and orders to pollitique states of the Romaines, Athenyens, Egiptiens, or Sparteins, but re∣corded in theuerlasting booke, within the whiche, the ve∣raie finger of god, hath sealed his infallible statutes, wher The bible thinfallible booke. of, as he wolde, that his children, and faithfull heires of his kingdom, were made partakers, with desyer and inde∣uor of ymytacion, so we are al warned by ye same defence, that besides the wrong and harme we do to our owne bo∣dies, we offend eynously against the health of our soules, specially in corruptinge the wife of our neighbour, with thabuse of that part of her, which is necessarie to be garded with as great care and watche, as we reade was vsed som∣time in the supersticious ceremonies of the vestals of Rome, in keping a contynuall fyer in their temple: The greatnes also of this synne of adulterie, bringing (as you se) an equal hurt to the soule and bodye, hath forced a won¦derful seueretie in both the lawes, punishinge by deathe Dyuine and humaine lavves. such as do prophane that hollye and invyolable bond and bed of mariage, wher is only a place of purity and no ob∣lacion to be offred or admitted, but the sacrifice of honeste & lawful substāce: besides what slaunders and mortalitie amongest men, haue spronge out of the vicious fountaine
of that synne, ye mariage bed of Menelaus defyled by ye kin∣ges sonne of Troye, hath left sufficient example, and cause of exclamacion amongest the phrigiens, with reason to all posterities, to deteste such villanie, as a vice moste abho∣mynable: in Egipt the Sychemetyens, for like respect vnder Abraham and Isaac, haue felt the mighty hand of god, al¦thoughe their offence (in some sort was excusable by igno¦raunce) for that they thought the wyues, which they toke, had bene vnmaried: Likewise, if there be any faithe in the poeticall fictions, we see, thargumentes of most of their tragedies, were founded eyther vpon the punishmente or dispair of such, as, not hable to reuenge the wrong of their lasciuions wife and wicked Sathanist her mynyon, conuert and execute their rage and furie vpon theimselues, wher∣in our worlde at this daye, is growen to such a malicious golphe and bottomles sea of vices, that the wilde nacions, without eyther awe of God, or feare of his lawes, gouer∣ned only by an instinct of nature, are more curious to kepe the honor of their bedd, then diuerse contryes in the harte and bowells of Christendom, wher thadulteror is not pu∣nished but by protestacion or attorney, and wher the poore man that receiueth the wrong, is rather iested at, and poin¦ted to with forqued fingers (accordīg to ye Italyan bragge) then he persecuted in any sorte, that procureth the euill, which partialitye or rather vnlawfull fauor of the Lawe and deputies of iustice, serueth as a sufficiente encourage∣ment both to the one and other whoremonger, wherupon followeth so many morders of husbandes, by meane & han∣des of their wiues, to thende they maye passe their ama∣rous practyse, with more pleasure and lesse feare, the poy∣seninge, and drowninge of so many lawfull children, for
aduauncement of those, whose bastarde race, is bew tified with a masqued title of true procreacion, whose end, is se∣sewerly, matched with destruction to themselues, and euer lasting dis honour to their parentes and posteritie, wherof behold here (you Ladyes) a familiar proffe, in the blacke, picture or portraytur of this bloddie gentlewoman, who, forgetting the vertue of her youth worthelie renow∣med of all men, colde not be satisfyed wyth tha∣buse of her age and hoarie heares, touchinge thincestious prostitucion of her body, without the nomber of vnnatu∣rall morders, wherwyth you maye see her tyrannous handes dyed, and thinno∣cent soules of her husband and ii. sonnes, kneling afore the troane of iustice, for vengance of her wickednes

of the most likelye and lustie gentlewoman in your traine, suche (saith she) as knowe nothing but by oponion & imagi∣nation, do commonly iudge at pleasure vpon matters of im∣portance, where they that haue felte the effectes, and made an experience of euerye point, maye resolue accordynge to a troth, wherin your ignorance acquites you for this tyme of imputaciō touching the loftines of my husbande, whō as you at vnwares accōpte a chāpyon of suche courage, yt there is no harnesse, whiche he is not hable to pearce, so the longe prooff I haue had of his worthines, may warraunte you the contrarye of such conceites, commendynge vnto you with∣all the compassion of my distresse, with desyer to procure some spedie meane of delyuerye, or release from this loath∣some torment, wherewith maister aduocat began to excuse hym of any entent to increase her griefe, what construction so euer she made of his former wordes, protestyng wythal, that the offer of death should bée more acceptable vnto hym, then the simple remēbrance to do her the leaste euill in the worlde, & if she sorowed in the prooffe of a badd husband, his gréefe was no lesse in the veraye viewe of her languishynge state, that I wishe (madame saith he) that my indeuor might discharge you of paine, or the spoile of my lyfe, and all that I haue of the worlde, confirme your quiet accordyng to the consent of your owne minde, then should you sée, whether your Tolonyo woulde put any difference betwene pleasant promises, whiche euery man can make, and assured effect whiche few men performe, with this further experience (yf it please you to employe me) to excede euery one of your do∣mesticall traine in yeldyng to the sommonce of your com∣maundement, albeit it importe the sacrifice of my lyfe or dissolutiō of honor, both which I accōpte happely preferred, yf they end in the pursewte of your seruice, wherewith he seased vpon one of her delicate handes, whiche he forgat not to honor with the often printe of his mouth, in sondry sortes of kysses, whiche as they argued thuttermost of his further entent, so she furthered an expedicion of thindifferent de∣syers
of theim both, in grasping his hand, with no lesse affe∣ction thē he did amarus homage to al her tender parts, with this shorte question in smylynge order: yf the goodnes of your fortune, Seigneur Tolonio, & the synister guide of my de∣stines, accompanied with the mocion of loue, wold giue you as muche power ouer me, as you seame desierous to enioye my fauor, howe would you accompte of suche preferment, or what iudgement woulde you set of her liberall offer, who neyther respectyng life, nor regard to honor, is here to leaue you her harte in gage, and her bodye to the vse of your pleasure: Ah madame, saith this amarous Cyuilyan, howe my vnworthynes makes me dispair, euer to cooll the frute of so greate a gaine, and the feare I féele to craue that I de∣syer moste, yeldes me no lesse doubtefull of theffect of your offer, albeit on thother part, the honor and felicitye I yma∣gin in the preferment, hath prickt me alredye so full of co∣rage, that the worlde hath nothyng of suche hardnes, which I dare not attempte, nor any thinge of so greate impossibi∣litye, whiche wyll not appeare easye in the pursuete, so that my trauell maye receiue his hyer at the hādes of your boun∣tye: pardon me I beseche you, in discoueryng that, whiche almost I kepte secret from mine owne harte, and yf my rashenes haue offended you, it maye lyke you to do iustice vpon your selfe, whose authoritie (with the force of extreme passion) hath forced me to a lauishenes in the thyng, whiche I durste not determyne, and muche lesse séeke to set abroche in déede. Here the shameles Lady tolde him his last request had preuented her longe meaninge, for (saith she) you haue hyt the marke, whereat I thoughte to shoote, wherein as I am cōtented to imparte credit to your wordes, wt persuaciō of sufficient assuraūce in your fidelitye, so I praye you, em∣brace mine offer of semblable curtesye, wt addiciō that your desyer to enioye me, is nothing in respect of the firme opi∣nion I haue to be so wholly yours, as your selfe shal deuise, wherof I am heare to seale tharticles of assurāce ī such sorte as you thinke good, wherupon I thinke no sortes of kysses
or follyes in loue were forgotten, no kynde of crampe, nor pinchyng by the lytle finger, nor his hande layed softelye in her delicate dugge, and she againe, with her armes aboute his necke to yelde tribut to his curtesye, was not vnminde∣full (I am sewer) to cōmunicate (in this place) the circum∣stance of her longe loue, and howe often she had béene at point to make declaration of her zeale, with the causes of re∣straint, till that hower, whiche yf she blessed accordynge to the greatnes of her felicitie, he thought it a dutye, to honor with treble thanke sgeuynge, performing there, their firste earnest of their vnhappye pleasure, to thindifferent conten∣tement of both thadulterous, who there gaue order for the conueighe of the rest of their licencious sequele. Here besides a consommacion and effect of detestable whor∣dom, wherein the one with impudencie, obteineth a gloot of her insatiable luste, and the other, vnhappely yeldes to thnbridled will of a deuelishe woman, yet is the foundaciō laied betwene the ij. wretches to encrease their offence with an acte of greater synne, for, besides the vice of contamina∣cion of an other mans bedd, the wicked doctor aggréed to a mortall conspiracie and treason agaynste hym, whoe was neither doutful of hys honestye, nor suspicious of hys fayth, and whose lyberallitye deserued a retourne of more credit, then to weaue the webb of his distruction, for that his chie∣fest meane of sustentation grewe by the fées and other assi∣stance of the gentleman: Ioseph the Hebrue abstained from like acte, although he was assailed with semblable importu∣nities in the hōuse of the prince of Egypte, desyeryng rather to proue thuttermuste rigour of hym, who thoughte hym selfe offended, then to synne haynously in the syghte of the great god, from whose eyes no secrett is conceiled, which in the end he doth not discloase, wt no lesse iustice in punishing the faulte, then he hath vsed longe pacience in tolleracion of the wickednes: Let euery man beholde here, an experi∣ence of the malice of those, that vnder the vaile of good lear∣nyng, bolstered with a dissembled showe of a certeine vaine

What enchaun∣tement so strongelye made, of whome thy subteltie can not vndo the charme? What armour of suche force, that is not founde to weake to resiste the strengthe of thy ma∣lice? What medecine of suche vertue, which can preuaile a∣boue thy infection? What, traine? What traison? What mischiefe or morderynge crueltie is hable to compare wyth the villenie of a woman, vnhappely deuested of thattire of reason and vertue, whiche for the moste part, are or ought to bee moste familiar with that secte? wherin appeareth an euident prooffe of the venemous pollecie in a woman, yf the outward aparance of an extreme sorow, (the hart reioysinge wc treble cōtentemēt within) do not declare her deceitful dis∣posiciō? what hipocrisie is greater, thē to suborne al sortes of

But now the funeralls performed to the dead Lorde of Chabrye, the Ladye, albeit she dismissed by lytle and lytle the greatnes of her dollor, yet she ceassed not her diligence in the searche of the morderer, nor forgat to promisse large hyer to suche as coulde bringe her the ministers of the fact, there was publike informacion, and secrett inquirye, wyth euery point and circumstance so Syfted to the quicke, that there lackte nothyng but the confession of him that was dead, whiche was impossible to bée had, or the testimonys of the bloddie parties, whiche were the commissioners ap∣pointed to enquire of the morder, whose handes smelled of the bloud of the dead innocent, whereuppon the matter was husht for a tyme, in whiche, TOLONIO was not ydle to ransicke euery secret corner in the house, not forget∣tynge (I thynke) to visytt the treasore he chiefly affected, and for a simple pleasure of the whiche, he had bene so pro∣digall of his conscience, who, yet not satisfyed with the sa∣crifyze of innocent lyfe, stirred vp desyer of greater synne: for this tyrannouse wyddow, had iiij. sonnes, whereof as ij. of theim were continuallye in the house, so the eldest, Ia∣lowse (not without cause) of the famyliaritye betwene his mother and her doctor, whose haunte he iudged to excede the compasse of his commission, and lymittes of honor, colde not so conceile nor disgeste the conceite of that, whiche persuaded a staine of infamye in the forheade or fore∣fronte

all chyldren towardes suche as made theyme the mem∣bers of this worlde, makes me as often cloase my mouthe against the discouerie of the longe grudge of my mynde, as I haue greate reason to ympart the cause to your ladishipp, who is tooched more neare then any other, that I wolde too god the thinge, wherof my mynde hath giuen a iudgement of assurance, were as vntrue, as I wishe yt bothe farre from myne opynion, and voyde of a trothe, then sewerlye sholde my hart rest, discharged of disquiett, and I dismyssed from thoffice of an oratour, whiche also I wolde refuce to perfor∣me, if thymportance of the cause did nor force my wil in that respect. Albeit as the passions of the mynde bée free, and the sprite of man (howe so euer the bodie bée distressed with cap∣tiuitie) hathe a pryuyledge of libertie, touchyng opynyons or conceites, so I hope your wisdome with the iustice of my cause, and clearenes of entent, are sufficient pillours too supporte that, whyche, the vertue of naturall zeale to your selfe, and dutifull regarde to the honour of my auncestors, moues me to communicate with you, chieflye, for that the Honor. best badge of your owne life, and bloodd of your late Lorde and husbande my father, bée distressed (as I am perswaded) by the secret haunte and vnsemelie glée of fauour betwene the proccurer Tolonio and you, whome, God and nature; haue made a mother of suche children, that neyther deserue suche lewde abuse in you, nor can brooke his villany in cor∣ruptyng the noble blood, wherewith they participate, with∣out vengance due to the greatnes of his poysoned malice: wherein good madame, as my deare affection to you war∣des, hathe made me so franke in warnynge you of the euill, so, yf you giue not order hensfurthe for the redresse of that, whiche I accompte alredie past euerye cause of dowte, you will come too shorte, to couer that can bée no longer conceiled, when also small compassion wilbée vsed in the re∣uenge of thiniurye, neyther can you in any sort complaine rightelie of me, in whose harte is alredye kindled a grudge of the wronge you haue don to ye nobilitie of vs al, loathing

you shall sée hereafter so mortefyed in me, that I will ney∣ther bée so hastye to accuse, nor suspect without better ad∣uise, for the whyche shée seamed thankefull vnto hym, with a present appeasement from Anger, attendyng the offer of oportunitie, when she myghte preferr her sōne to a parte in the tragedye whyche her wickednes hadde alredye begon vppon hys late father: for shée was doutefull styll of the youngeman, and gaue lesse faythe to his wordes, wherein certeinely appeareth an experience of an ordinarie custume in the wicked, who payseth thinfydelitie of others, in the ballance of their owne iniustice, and wante of faithe, for the tyrant dowteth to whose creditt to comitt the sauetie of him∣selfe, because his crueltie is hated of all men, neyther dothe he good to any, yf not for the respect of profit, or to performe some malicius attempte, wherein as they consider thaffex∣cions of their people, by the passions in theimselues, soo in passynge. theyr owne lyfe in continuall feare, they procure lyke terror to suche as bée conuersant with theim, makyng the disquiett of others equall to the miserie of theimselues, lyke as thys new Megera or tyrannouse monster of oure tyme, who, no more satiffied with the blood of her husband, then glutted or cloyed with ye continual pleasures in whore∣dome with her detestable Tolonyo, determined to rydde the world of her innocent sonne, to thend their villanous trade mighte passe with more assurance, and lesse cause of feare or suspicion of any: for thexecutiō wherof, her wickednes deui∣sed this spedy and necessarie meane: There was within the castel, a highe gallery, borded vnderfote with certeine plan∣kes fastned to rotten planchers, where as ye young gentle∣man vsed his dailye recreacion in walkinge, by reason of the delitefull ayre, & pleasant prospect vppon dyuerse feldes and gardyns, so the Tygresse his mother reserued that place, as a most chiefe & mortal minister in the death of her son, for she and her pernicius proccurer one euenyng, knocked oute of either ende of diuerse of the plankes, the nayles that kepte theime cloase to the plancher, in suche sorte, that the nexte,
that happened too make hys walke there, shoulde haue no leasure to discouer the traison, and much lesse lyue, to bring reapport of the hardnes of the rockes growing in the diches, vnder the sayd gallerie, which chaunced vnhappelie to the sonne of this she wolffe, who no more happie in a mother, then his father fortunate in a wife, renewed the next day his accustumed walkes in the valte, wher he had not spent thre or foure tornes, but his destynie brought hym to treade vp¦pon the fatall bourd es, who hauinge no holde nor staye to rest vpon, disioyned theimselues wyth the wayght of thin∣fortunat gentleman, who falling soddeinly vpon the rockes wyth hys heade forwarde, was brused to peces, beinge dead Her eldest sonne slaine by treason. in dede, almost so sone as he felte thapprehencion of death, Who wold haue iudged such trayso in a mother to work such an end to her son or noted such wate of pitie in any of ye sect, as to soe the séedes sprong in her owne flankes, deformed and he wed in peces vpon the edge of sharppe and piked stoanes: what mistortune to the sonne, and villanie in a mother: se∣inge the title of a sonne ought to be so deare, and name of a mother, is so delicate and of such vertue, that no hart, of what mettal soeuer it be made, is not mollefyed and doth homage to that dignitie, yea euerye one holdeth his blodde so deare, that, the beastes theimselues, by a prouocacion of nature, (although other wayes insensible) haue such affectioned re∣garde to their fawnes, that they feare not to contend against euery peril of death, to defende their youngons from daun∣ger, what greater felicity hath mā, trauelling in the stormy sea of this worlde, then to see (as it were) a regeneracion of hymselfe, in hys children, wyth a plentifull and gladsome encrease of his séede, for whych cause chiefely, god ordeyned the holye institucion of mariage, not respecting altogether, the mortefyeng of the ticklyshe instinctes of our declayning fleshe, but rather of regarde, as thappostel affirmeth, to kepe the societie of man in order, making it appear'e pure and ae∣ceptable to the great monarke, and syrst founder of so noble a worke. But, to retorne now to our historie, this ympp
of thinfernall lake, and hellish Lady, beinge already dispoy∣led of all affection and dutie required in a woman towardes her husband, detested also euery point of charitie and zeale, whych nature chalenged in her to the frute flowered wyth∣in the tender partes of her intralls, whose fall and misera∣ble deathe, as you sée, filled ymediatlie euerie corner of the castel with desolacion and teares, some weping in the want of their brother, other complayned the lacke and misfortune of ther kynsman, the viewe of whose dysmembred bodye, sturred vp also a freshe sorowe on the behalfe of their late Lorde, but all their dollor was nothing to the howlinge and cries of the detestable mordress, who entermedled her greffe, wyth such argumentes of desperacion, that her sorowe sea∣med sufficient to make the earth tremble, and moue the hea¦uens to teares, neyther seamed she to make other accompte of the world, then a place of most loathsome abode, by which masqued semblance of outwarde heauines, she couered an inward ioye at her hart, and by this pollecie of painted dule, she blaired the eyes of the simple multitude, who, after ye re∣tire of the heate of theyr lamemtable stormes, consulted vp∣pon the buyrial, wyth general consent in the ende, that thin∣nocent striplinge should be laiede in the tombe of his infor∣tunate father, to thend, he might participat with hym in the fatal pitt, as he was equal to hym touching the malice of his mother. And now as this bloddie Lady, had in this sort, discharged (as she thought) euery doubt and feare hereafter, chiefly for that she stoode no more in awe of any Censor or spie to kepe a kalender of her faltes, wherby she vsed lesse care in the con∣ueigh of her beastly traffique wyth her viperus aduocat: So not wythstanding her seconde sonne, grudginge still in the deathe of hys brother, and some what doubtful of the cause, began to be Ieleouse in the pointes of his mislike, and be∣inge of equal corage to his brother, and of no lesse nobilitye in hart, cold not also disgest the view of dishonour, specially in the highest degree of hys house and affynitie, whereof he
gaue declaracion in his sterne countenances to TOLONYO, to whome, yf he spake at times by any occasion, his wordes argued the disdayne in his hart, vsing, vnhappelie, the lyke regardes and tearmes to his mother, who, not liking to haue any tutor, to note or controll her villanie and hardned with all in thexecution of fleshe and life, iudged it no offence to embrue her handes with the blod of this innocente, and paint euery post and posterne of her castel, with the braines of her posteri. ie, resoluing ymediatly vppon the fatall con∣spiracie agaynst her second sonne, swearinge his death with her execrable mynister TOLONYO, who vnder toke ye charge with promise to perform theffect, wherin he vsed, the meane and expedicion by hym, who first distressed the father, for this reuerende lawyer, rather studied in the philosophie of Sa∣than, then traded in the skill of thordynances of kynges and Emprours, or experienced in matters belonginge to the senat, so coniured the morderer wyth perswacions and proffers of rewarde, that he admitted the bargayne, and gaue Yt is easye to corrupt him, vvhich is euil of him∣selfe. assurance of the consommacion, wherin he failed not of any point or article: for certeine dayes after, the gentleman, be∣ing on huntinge, vppon certayne mountaines enuyron∣ning a hollow and lowe valleye, as his men were buysye in rewarding their howndes, wyth the pawnche and intrals of certeine chasses they had killed, their vnfortunate maister, reapposed hymselfe vppon the edge of a steape and high hill, whose discent ymported a perillous regard, by the deepe and hollow vaulte in the valleye, replenished on euery side with sharppe and hideous rockes: here, as he accompted hymselfe most sewer, and furthest from cause or effect of traison, hee founde greatest daunger wyth stroake of mortall destructi∣on, for that, the hyerd mynister of his death, tracing his step yes all the daye, to fynde an occasion fyt to further the ende of hys buysynes, refused not thoffer of so cōuenient a meane & place, for as they were in familiar deuise together, the one dreadinge no harme, & the other attending thassistance of the deuil to performe his wickednes, stept of a soddaine behinde,
& thrust the vnhappie gentleman from the topp of ye moun∣taine to the bottom of the valleye, where the sharp rockes re∣ceyuing Her seconde sonne slaine by her vvic∣kednes him wythout respect of hys innocencie, made mor∣sels of his guiltles carkasse. What difference may a man set betwene the desolacion of hys house, and myserie of the succession of Atreus the Greeke, whose children were cruelly cut in peces, the wyfe of one of theym suruiuing, a noted woman of all the world for incestious lyfe, becomes in the end the mordresse of her husband, by thassistance of thadulteror and defyler of their mariage bed, and she wyth her rybaud oppressed at last wyth vengance equal to their offence by the handes of her owne sonne, what pytie is it to sée an experience of such examples amongest christians, and in this age, yea in the place and con¦try, where the regarde of parentes towards their children is suche, that they make no conscience to hazarde their owne lyues, to defende the health of suche as nature hathe geuen theym for succession: where this execrable ympp of infernall procreaciō, borne for the skourge and plage of her posteritie, respecting more to conceile & aggrauat her wickednes, then careful any way, to repēt her synnes, delited (as it seamed) to sprinkle the earth wyth innocent blod, whych cryed ven∣gance both against her and her companiō of these horryble morders, according to the iudgement of the great god, who keping a true reckoning, of euery drop of blod that hath ben spilt, since the deathe of Abell the iust, vntil the last afflicti∣on of as many as hath bene, or shalbe vniustlie persecuted, punished or mordered hy ye malice of ye wicked, prouideth cō¦monly yt such acts of detestaciō, receiue end, by the discoue∣rye of the life passed of such infamous wretches, wherof be¦hold an experiēce in this cursed lady, who, after the funerals of her yonger son, seing yt al her seruants kept eye & watche vpō her, wt suspiciō of her vicious dealing, ymparted ye whole to the gallād her miniō, who consulted and cōcluded ymedy∣atly the end of their pleasures and exercises of blodd toge∣ger, whiche was to marye one an other, wherein albeit appeared a diffycultye, for that TOLONYO, hadde
alreadie a wyfe, no lesse wise, faire, and vertuous, then he cruell, spitefull, and vicious, yet it seamed not ympossible, for that the wicked man accompteth a facilytie in euerye thynge, whych he estemeth eyther reasonable or lawfull: He determyned at what price soeuer it wer, to make her plaie a fourth parte in the former tragedie of the father and his ii. sonnes, ympartinge his bloddie resolucion to his beastlye trooll, who, no lesse assured in such euill, then ready to make a mynister in thattempt, as the common villeine, that stur∣reth not from the straites of the mounteynes, stripping eue ry passenger, not hable to resyste his force) allowed the de∣uise, wyth speciall request of expedicion in thaccomplishmēt: Al whiche it is to be thought, the couetus doctor, did not de∣uise, wyth intent to performe, for the respecte altogether of loue or frendshipp, he bare to her, whom he goeth nowe a∣bowte to marye, for he considered, that men, for the moste part, embrase traitors, to make their proffyt of their inuen∣tions and subtelties, which when they haue wrested frome them, eyther the traitors bée punished by death, or at leaste, so disdained, that their miserye in lyuinge, showeth thun∣dowted difference betwene vertue and vice, disposicion of an infidell, or one that esteeth not his fayth, and he that is carefull to kepe his conscience cleare from suche spott: So Tolonyo not ignorant of ye large reuenue, and great summes of moneye of the ladye of CHABRYE, wyth store of other welthe aboute the castel, accompted it a commoditie, to ex∣chaunge the lyfe of hys wyfe, for the fylthie vse of so greate riches, meaning notwythstanding, to enioye the spoiles of so plentifull a praye, and after to sende her packinge, and make her passe by the pathe of so manye morders committed both by the one and thother. Oh vnbridled couetousnes and execrable desyer of vnhonest gaine, howe haste thou blaired the eyes and vnderstandynge of men now a dayes, hardning their hartes agaynst the dread of god, and feare of his lawes? what mischiefe hath ouerwhelmed vs by thy meanes, seing the father is Ielowse of the faythe of hys sonne, the wyfe
doubtful of her husbande, the neighbour fearyng ambushes of treason in his nexte companion, and the prince often ty∣mes in daunger of his sauetye, beinge besett on euery syde with the garde and ministers of money, whiche hath suche force ouer the fragilitie of men that some time the seruant conspireth against his Lord, to enriche himself wt the spoiles of his maister, the sonne grudgeth in the long lyfe of hys fa¦ther, because he kepes hym from thuse of his possession. And some we see procureth the death of hym, for whose lyf & preseruation of health, he ought to be in continuall prayer, neyther doth the malyce of that wickednes reste altogether in the hartes of the temporal, but, ther be, also of the sacred sorte infected with ye poyson of that enemous worme, who the more she groweth in strength and force, the greater mi∣serye do wée féele, that vnhappy is that worlde whiche parti∣cipateth with so hurtefull an ayre, wherin if this abhomi∣nable desyer of gaine, haue power to disolue that, wherein God hath forbidden a separacion by man, and nature bounde vs to an equal care and zeale, as to our selues, I sée not what waye we maye take, to fynde assurance of fayth and loyal∣tye, nor vnder what clynat maye bee founde any, whiche imitate the simplicitie of our auncestors seing the malice of our age, excedeth (in that respect chiefelye) all corruption that euer hath bene noted amongest the most infydelles, and cruell barbaryans, that eyther lyue nowe, or haue bene in any time afore. And so to our morderinge Tolonyo, who buil∣dyng a thousand castels in the ayre vpon the complott made for the dispatche of his wyf, was not hable to resolue vppon any certeine meane touching thexecution, for, seaminge (as they saye) to holde the swyne by the eare, he was loath to let her go, and doubtefull whiche waye to kepe her, wythout daunger to himself; somtime he was of opiniō to worke the fatal meane by poyson, wherein appeared absolute perill, for that himselfe was ignorant in bruinge the confection, & the assistaunce of an appoticarie was denied, in that he dreaded
a discouerye in impartinge the misterye to a straunger: he practised with hym, who (as you haue harde) serued his torne in the slaughter of the father and sonnes, wherein, albeit he was deceiued, and the destynie of his wyf rather deferred, then her punishment forgiuen, yet the daye of her fatall date seamed to approche, for that, as he half dispaired in the fidelity of his former executioner touchinge this thirde at∣tempte of blode, wherein also appeared a difficultie in the acte, for that, the chaste Ladye sturred not muche out of her house, so, reaposinge muche for himselfe in thassistaunce of the sprite that guided his entent, he abandoned the ayde of any man, and committed the effect and circumstance to his The deuill. owne handes, by whom was performed the fatall consom∣mation, the nighte folowing his cōference with the hyered traytour, when he strangled her in bede, wyth a napking of Tolonyo kil leth his vvife. thin hollande, wounde faste about her necke, and as she was in the extremetye of her laste pange he cryed for helpe, ad∣uouchyng (with a troubled countenaunce to the seruantes that came to the resowe of their dead mystrys) that it was the soddain fall of a cold rewme, with superfluitye of fleame that had forced this mortall suffocacion in his wyfe, whyche was easelye beleued of his men, and had so stayed wythout further inquiry of the case, if God had not awaked, with the noyse of the crye, the aged man her father, who the same night sopped wyth his doughter, and lefte her in as good estate, as she was euer afore, in whome the consent of the destynies of Tolonyo, and the iustice of the highest, seamed of indifferent operacion in the viewe of his tragedie, for that notwithstandynge his teares and sorowe, he gaue diligent regarde to the face and throate of his doughter, wherof the one was swelled and pooffed vpp wyth blacke blood, and in the other appeared a circle or print of ye thing that wrought theffect of her death, wheruppon folowed a secret iudgemēt in himselfe, that she was distressed by mortal violence, and the deflurion which smothered and stopped the conduites of her breath, were the handes of her husbande, or some other

Beholde heare the ende of thimpudent loue of these adulterers, the frutes of so dete∣stable

FINIS.
The argument AMongest all the passions which na∣ture sturreth vp to disquiet the mind of man, there is none of such tyrany, or kepes vs more in awe, then the detestable humor of couetousnes, and raging appetyt of whoredome, wher∣of as both the one and the other, en∣gender frutes of semblable furie, and expose effectes of equal euill, So he is of treble commen∣dacion, that being possessed of the firste, dothe rather a∣bandon his goodes, then in pursewinge the suggestion of his insatiable desier, semes to procure willingly his owne torment in this world with assured daunger to his soule in the day of general accompt, and vanquishing the second, which earst had thon y awe and dominion of him, he lea∣ues a glorious remembrance of ymortalitie to his name, and dischargeth his conscience of a heauie and yrkesome burden. But if the desier to wynn great treasures, makes the noble mynd forgetful of the regarde of his honor, with constraint to do things not worthie any way of the title of vertue, or if (according to virgil in his second Eneydos) this gredy thirst after golde, is of force to corrupt the har∣tes of mortall men, and fill theym full of all infection, it is nothing to the power of the sensuall appetit, whyche once taking possession of our inwarde partes, god kno∣weth what frutes it bringes furth, formyng vs in a frame of brutalitie, nothing inferior to thinsensible sorte, accor∣dinge to the Greke orator, saieng that when a man giueth hymselfe to the pleasures of the fleshe, be makes exchange of thexcellencie whyche he participates wyth thymage of god, and becomes of forme and likenes to a beast wythout vnderstanding, wherin also the wise king of the Hebrues

The great Alexander, albe it he was more giuen to sensu∣alitie, A merueilus contynencie in the great Alexander. then stoode wyth the honor of so worthie a prince, yet forbare he to do wronge to the chastetie of the mother and wife of the great Monarke Daryus, albeit they being his prisoners, their honor and life were also at his dispo∣cicion, only he had not suche credit in his owne continencie as the Romaine Scipio. for that he durste not once come

La∣dy in his tent, And because we maye be holde to enterme∣dle the renolome of our owne time with the glorie of an∣tiquitie, Let vs geue no lesse commendacion to Frances Sforze sometime Duke of Myllan a man of singler fame for a Captein of our tyme, who according to the chronicles of Italy was presented with a younge maide of rare and exquisite bewtie, by a soldiour of his whiche reserued her life at the saccage of a Towne he had won by assalte, and albeit he was younge, ful of wanton humors, and nothing degenerating from thytalyan inclynacion touching the de∣sier of the fleshe, yet beinge at the point to assaile the cas∣tle of her honor, vpon her humble peticiō for the sauegard of her chastetie, he deliuered her wythout any wronge to her virginitie, all which examples as I must confesse to deserue euerlasting memorie, & they that haue vsed such vertuous abstinence, meritorious of ymmortall commen∣dacion, yet I can not compare their doinges with the ver∣tu of hym, who thorowly gauled with the arowes of loue, hauing longe courted a young and faire damesell, tasted of euery passion whiche may, any way pinche the harte of him that is plunged in affection, and desyeringe nothinge but the rewarde of loue, which giues ende to thamarous sorowes, after he had spente manye nightes in hollowe dreames, consumed the daies in incerteine ymaginacions, wepte, sighed, and otherwaies tormented hym selfe in the pursewt of his mistres, when his desier was of greatest force, and his hope redie to conuert it self into dispaire, being sewed vnto, and hauyng power ouer her who earst
might haue commaunded him and al that was his, checked the humor of his former appetit, and dismissed her without the losse of the least iote of her honor, whose example me thinkes makes blushe all other which earste haue beene preferred as pattornes of coutynencie, for that in ouer∣commyng him selfe, he did not only refraine to laye hands vpon her, who yelded the vse of her honestie rather by ne∣cessitie, then prouocacion of affection, but also embrasinge her rare assurance in vertue, releued her wante no lesse plentifully, then if she had bene his sister bred in the wombe wherin him selfe was conceiued, of suche one do I meaue to discourse in the historie following, as more vertu∣ous and worthie of praise, then either Scipio, Alex∣ander, or Sforce, wherein notwith∣standing I refer the Judge∣ment to such as haue van quished the force of af∣fection by sembla∣ble vertue

THe recordes of antiquitie & monumen∣tes in IEYNE, making a perticular dis¦cription of diuers accedentes happening to the noble house of Vynaldo,: haue left a special note of one Luchyn (being of the remeynder of that race) who succeding his parentes in patrymonie and possessi∣on, was nothing inferior in al respectes of honor and vertue, and exceded theym all in liberall dispo∣sicion and gifte of bowntie, detesting the nigardlike order of the Ienoways, who gasping more of tene then they get meat, The order of the hungrye Spanyarde. do cōmonly rise frō the table with an appitit, & make cleane their téeth, when they fil not theyr bellie, like as also the hun¦grie spanyarde, who being at hoame can liue of a litle, but feding of an other mans trēcher, his throate seames as wide as the deuowring awstrich, & is hable to match the gredieste flemyng and greatest epicure in Almayne. He being thus thonly heir of his house, reauing alreadie a∣mōgest ye massye bagges of his father, who left him the keyes of his goldē coffers, set a broach ymediatly ye frank dispositiō of his liberal hart, & opening al ye gates of his pallaice, denied ye repaire of none, wherby he somoned in short time a lustye train of gāllandes & glory of youth, more apt to hunt ye chasse

seames also to  smal regard in ye disposition of his affai¦res with lesse discrō in knitting thaffectiōs of those vnhap¦pie wretches whiche he bringes to drawe vnder the yoke of his awe, whereof our age swarmes with examples, whiche I am contente to dismisse for this time, by reason of ye super∣fluitie of the same, & referr you to the sequile of this Luchin, who dandled (as it were vpon the lappe offollye and, serued with nothinge but dishes of delit & are, could not beare so euen a hand vpō the bridle of his affectiōs, but or he wiste he let slipp the steddie raigne of his libertie & became ex∣tremely in loue with a simple maide, whose beautie he ac∣compted of more price, then her selfe or parentes noble by discente or other speciall assistance of fortune. And albeit his personage and liuyng with thestimation of other gyftes whiche nature had lente him aboue the reste, seamed suffi∣ciently hable to make hym meritorious of fauor of the beste Ladie of a countrey, yet loue (hauyng neither respecte to his race nor regarding his greatnes) did close his eyes from the viewe of such as were hable to answere him in equalitye of discente & vertue, and conuerted his harte and affection to the contemplacion of a simple maide, whose name albeit is not of such veneration as Camylle and Lucretia, whose high titles onlye do importe a certeine semblance and creditt of honestie in the person of a publike curtisan, yet her chastetie with womanly gouernement, deserueth no lesse cōmenda∣cion then the most approued of auncient time, for being the doughter of a pore man, she grudged not with the porcion of pouertie, but thought it a principall vertue to embrace the lott of her state with thankeful contentement, & be carefull to releue the harde condicon of her parentes with the honest endeuor of her handes, she made not her beautye, a looking glasse for the worlde, but studied to be worthie of so precious a Iewell, she woulde not suffer her bodie to be pampred with delicacye, leaste her mynde sholde be subiecte to thin∣fection of euil, nor giue any place to thalarmes of the fleshe, leaste the same should preuale aboue her resistance, & being
of the age of fyftene or sixtene yeres, her modestie was of no lesse admiracion seruing, as a lanterne to light all the ladies of Ieyne, then her beautie (without a seconde) hable to allure the best assured of a countrey, whose firste viewe and simple regarde, brought suche suddaine astonishement to the loftie minde of this Luchyn, that after he had conferred the secrett misterie, which nature had hiddē in her face, with the special Beautye. gifte of seamely behauior bestowed vppon her by God, his harte seamed enchaunted, & eyes as lymed with the glaunce of her lookes, not hable to wythdrawe their regardes from the contemplacion of so perfecte a beautie, whiche was not set out to the sale, by any artifyciall meanes of paintynge or assistance of pouder or other vaine experience of diuers of oure counterfaite masquers nowe a dayes, neyther did she seame to preferr any suborned brauerie for thaduan∣cement Vvomē seame masquers in painting their faces. of so precious a dowrye, either by superfluous frizi∣lation of the heare, twincklinge of the eye, wrynginge the lip, or wrestinge the chyn, minsynge or measurynge her pace, as thoughe her ioyntes were oute of tune, or tyed together wyth pointes, or other lewde Iestures de∣uised by the curtisan, and practised as a principle and chiefe grace at this daye, by diuers of our delicatt and wanton dames: who not waighing the due merite of so precious an ornamēt, & lesse worthie to weare so rare a badge of nature, do abuse the goodnes of theim both, in conuertting the onely gifte of God into a detestable meane to agrauate synne. And receiuing thus the first somōce of loue, whose arrowes being fethered with the wing of infection, do leaue the harte wounded with a burnyng desier to pursue thinstigacion of our appetit, he founde himselfe to weake to abide any more alarams, albeit striuing a litle at the first to defende his li∣bertie, with ye intent to aunswere appeale to thuttermost of his forces, he brewed the broth of his owne ale, & renewed ye torment of his passiō in such sort, yt there were fewe dayes in yt wherin he performed not his pale walke afore the lodging of his faire Ianiquette, whom if by any aduenture his
roauing eyes did spie at ye doare, he forgatt not to salute, with no lesse humylitie, then if she had bene one of the greateste ladies in Ieane, courting her besides with a low reuerence & other offices of dutiful ciuilitie, in no lesse reuerend maner then if he had presented his seruice to the greatest princesse of Italy whiche also driue the girle into some amaze, as one not exsperienced in the order of such amarus gretinges, and lesse vsed to be saluted by any gentleman equall in callinge or cōdiciō to Siegneur Luchyn, whose fame as it was great both by ye authoritie he bare in ye Citie & reputacion of his liuing, wyth other giftes and ornamentes of nature, So it driue her into doble astonishment to conster the meaning of his newe courtesie, albeit leauing ye diuinaciō of his intent, to a time of more leasure, she retired to the vertue of her good norri∣ture, for yt which she was no lesse meritorious, then imbra∣sed (as you sée) for her bewtie, And drawing ye blod of seamly shame into her face, which set such a glass of natural white & red of her cōmplexion, yt her coollor seamed to be died in the dew of ye fragrāt morning of May, & retorned his courtsie wt a salutaciō of sēblable humilitie, wherin he reioysed wt more cōtētmēt of mind, then if ye Quene of Spaine had yelded him fauor to kysse her hād. But what nede he tickle himself to make himself laugh, or why did he not eschew ye presēce and place of his enemy, rather thē seame so subiect to ye sōmonce of his eye, to whō loue hath giuen the gift of flatterie to de∣ceiue ye rest of ye partes, for if at ye first he had corrected ye flic∣kering reaporte of his eyes, his hart had bene fre frō desier, & he not at the brinke of passion, & tormentes, & if at ye bigin∣ning, he had abādoned ye place, he had also dismissed the remē∣brance of that, whiche nowe hathe bounde hym to pursewe beautie. the queste of hys owne disquiete, neyther dothe hee other thynge in visitynge the place where shee is, then throwe water vppon hoate ymbers, whyche dobleth the heate, and forceth the flame with more expedicion, for the more he be∣helde her, and the lesse she regarded hym, the greater grew his affection, geuing treble increase to his desier.
And albeit she was neither fyne in attire, sett out in robes of riche araye, nor deckte with apparell for the more deco∣racion of her naturall beautye, yet appeared she no lesse precious in the eye of this gallande, then if she had bene trimmed for the nonste, in the same order that the Poetes faine of the browne Egypciane when she was broughte to lye wyth the Romaine Capteine Marcus Anthonius. He fay∣led not to reiterate his haunte with an ordinarie trade to the stréets of aniquette, resoluynge his cōmon abode or place of staye righte ouer againste her lodginge whiche increased her doubte of that misterye, till nature that discusseth the darknes of suche doubtes, and bringes the moste rude crea∣tures of the worlde to be capable in the argumentes of loue, reuealed vnto her the meanynge of that ridle, sayinge yt the roundes and often tornes wyth vaylinge of bonnett whiche the proude pirott made afore the dore of her fortresse, was no other thynge then the intisynge harmonie of the Syrenes, or other stale to allure or make her plyable to thappetite of Mearemaides his will, wherin she was the rather resolued for certeinetie, for that within shorte tyme, passing that waye, he ymagined a staye righte ouer againste her house, Where féedinge the tyme for the nonste in deuise with one of his frendes, gaue skoape to his eyes to peruse (with continuall contempla∣cion) the maiestie of his mistres in suche sorte, that one of her compagnions exercisynge also the vse of the nedle, en∣countred by chaunce she gredie regardes he caste to Iani∣quette, to whom sayth she, thou arte litle beholding to ye good∣nes of fortune, that seames so greate an enemye to the me∣rite of thy beautie, for if thy condicion or calling wold admit ye aduancemēt, which the present preferment of nature doth offer the, no doubte thou sholdest become in short time ye ho∣nor & decoration of al thy house, for touchinge the resolucion of mine eyes & iudgemente of my conceite, proceding of the deuouring regardes yonder gentlemā casteth towardes the, he is not only ye bondman of thy beautye, but also so addicted to the seruice of the same, yt only thou Ianiquette may dispose
of him his honor & lyfe & al that hehath. And trulye thou arte not so happie to be the controller of so noble a chāpion, as of litle discretion, if thou make small accompte of his seruice, whiche the veraye greatest dames of our prouince, woulde reserue as a special relique or Iewel, neither oughtest thou to make thy beautye of such price, as the respect therof shold preuaile aboue the goodnes of so greate an offer, seinge that the walles of this towne do inclose a nomber of younge La∣dyes and gentlewomen, that excedynge the in beautye and bringyng vp, wolde not seame curious in admittyng the be∣nefyt of so good a fortune. Whereunto the honeste Ianiquettē, that neither tooke pitie of his paynes, nor allowed his endeuor, & lesse liked the per∣swacions of her companion, who peraduenture boarded her so farr to make a prooffe of her honestie, replied no lesse wi∣sely, then wyth more discretion then comonly we note now a dayes in one of her yeres. Yf I were borne (quoth she) vnder thinfluence of fortune, or Ianiquetta aunsvvereth her compaig¦nion bounde to abide the sentence of her doome; I were not vn∣like to performe thexspectation of thy allurementes, but seing I am deriued of a contrary cōstellation, moostring al∣wayes vnder the ensigne & collours of vertue, I haue my sal∣fe conduite at all times to withstāde thinuasion of such infe∣ctions, with authoritye to defye the malice of any such ac∣cident. And touching the cōmendacions which you seme to giue to mon Seigneur Luchin, both in the title of honor, estima∣ciō of his publike authoritie in thaffaires of this citye, toge∣ther with his dexteritie in al giftes incidente to a gentlemā, I saye, he more plentifully he is considered at the handes of God with a singularitie in suche ornamentes, So much the more ought he to studye to seame worthie of so rare a parti∣cipacion, not conuerting the vertue of his talent giuen him from aboue, into a sinister entente & disposicion of wicked∣nes to seduce the chastetie of simple maides, whose faultes (if any be) he ought rather to reprehende with seueritie, thē minister corrupcion cōtrary to the commission of his honor,
neyther shall be at anye time (I hope) preuaile so ouer my beautye, as the vse of the same shall giue him other conten∣tement then a frendlye oniour of the mouth, whiche all ho∣neste maides may do without preiudice, thinking the frend∣ship of nature of no greater moment in giuyng me the title of faire, then the vertue meritorious in preseruing the same (accordyng to the merite) without spott of infamye or wor∣thye reproche of the worlde, for her offence is double afore God (sayeth she) and treble skandalous in the mouth of the multitude, that exchaūgeth her beautye (being a chiefe signe and argument of grace which God hath painted in the face of a womā (as the philosopher saith) for any other price (how greate so euer it appeare) then the honeste pawne & gage of lawfull matrimonye, accordinge to thinstitucion of oure sa∣uiour, who allowing chiefly the oblacion of chastetie, dothe condemne the cōtrary into perentory destruction, and what haue we in this worlde that we ought to make so deare ac∣compte of, as our honeste name, being the thing that yeldes vs not only an admiracion whilste we enioye the vse of lyfe vpon earth, but also makes vs liue after our death with a perpetuall commendacion of our integritye to the remein∣der of our race. Doste not thou knowe (my deare Maryone) that in the swete and dewye mornynges of the spring, there apperes certeine flowers no lesse delitefull to the beholders, then yeldynge an odiferous smell with an inticynge desyer to be gathered so long as their fragrāt and freshe perfumes indures, but when the heate of the son (perching the gallāds of Aurora) shall pearce thorowe bothe boodd and roote, and mortifye the liuelye hewe of suche brickle creatures, the flower is not only forgotten and loathed, whiche earste was so much embraced, but the desyer of all men taken awaye as though there neuer had bene any such, like wise ye glistering apple growing vpon the high spraies in the pleasant lādes of Angeau, semes a thing of great delectacion to the eye, & of no lesse pleasante taste so long as he is entyer and without corrupcion, but after the worme hath eyther made a breach,
or his gréenes or pleasante maturitie lost his force, and conuerted into a rotten ripenesse, his bewtie dekaies wyth desier any longer to kepe hym, Euen so a mayde what po∣uertie soeuer oppresse her, so longe as she kepes vnspotted her surname and title of chastetie, is not only admitted, but also may chaleng place amongest the best of a countrye, but when the caterpillor hath once cropped the leaffe and deuow red the boodd, the trée doth not only die and perish with infa∣mye, but the remembrance of such stocke and frute remei∣nes in the recordes of reproche to the opening of the greate booke of general accompt, when al faltes shalbe reueiled and punished according to their disposicion and qualitie. And se∣wer it is better for a woman of what degrée soeuer she be, to dy wt honor, and buyrye the bourdē of honest renowm with her bodie in the graue, then enioying the fruicion of life, to be marked of the multitude with a note of generall rebuke whych (as a moothe in a garment) will not ceasse to eate and deuour her present estimacion, and make notorious besides euery age of her succession by the desert of her disordred life, loasing the only cause that makes me ioye in my selfe wyth so great desier to liue, wherin because I may the rather per forme theffect of thys last resolucion, I will firste wyth an vnfayned hart, make inuocation to ye highest for thassistance of his grace, to garde me frome thassaltes and peppered prouocations of the fleshe, and then cut of all suche occa∣sions as may eftesones aduance the suggestion of the same, or seame any way an ympedimente to the vowe I haue pre∣sentlie made, whych I doubt not wilbe armes sufficient e∣nough to repulse ye alarams of Signeur Luchyn, & raise ye siege which I sée he hath planted agaynst the fortresse of my chas∣tetie, wherin she omitted not thexecution, for from that in∣stante, shee kepte her selfe vnsene of anye, but her fren∣des and kinsefolkes, comminge lyttle or nothynge a∣broade, and lesse willing to be spied out of windows or stand at the doore, leauinge thereby an example worthye of
ymitacion to all estates and sortes of women, but specially, suche gigges, and pratlinge houswiues, as can not con∣tente theym selues with the ayre of the house, nor giue one pricke with the nedle, oneless she sit at the doare, as though her exercyse were onelye to menteyne chatt wythe the streete walkers, or keepe a standynge and make challenge agaynste all commers, whyche is the thynge, that (you mothers) and tutours of lytle girles oughte chyefly to res∣pecte in the direction of youre tender charges, I meane to bridle and brynge vpp youre pupilles and ympes that haue follye tyed on their backes, in the awe of correction, & yf they transgress the order of good gouernement, you must not forgett to offer theym the racke and tormentes of the rodde, which, you must minister vnto theim in the gree∣nes of their yer es, and affore the tendrenes of youthe with wante of discrection wil suffer theim to discerne their owne inclinacion, for as the Philosopher tearmeth theym, to bée a kinde of cattell more apte to declyne, then any other reaso∣nable creature, so saith he) yf they get once the bit betwene their téethe, and crop of the hearbée of ryotus will, it is har∣der to reclayme theym eyther hy awe, feare, compulsion or gentle intreatie, then the wilde haggard or rammish falcon by any connynge or deuise of their keper, besides as a maide is a Iewell of no lesse greate price, then rarely to be founde, so she is a vessell moste bryckle and easye to be broken, and being once eyther crackte or corrupted, she liueth in none o∣ther accompte then in comon wonder of the people and poin¦ted at of all the worlde. Wherefore, you mothers that in the bringyng vpp of your doughters, will giue ashowe of your owne vertue, with no lesse care of the honor of your children, must forgett to pam∣per youre younglines with presentes of their willes, or dandle theym vppon the lapp of dame folly, but féede theym The norsse. rather with the discipline of good nouriture, not sparing the order of due correction, leaste you spill the future hope and expectation of their well doynge, and better it is to haue a
mayde smell of honest simplicitie, vsing a temperate scilēce in her toungue and order of talke, then (ytalianated in le∣gerdemaines of subteltye, and pricked full of the fethers of foolyshe pride), to haue the tounge of a popingaie, bablinge without order or discrecion, for that the one is a vertue of it selfe, and the veray lyne to leade her to aduauncement, and in practisinge the other, she procures a discredit to her pa∣rentes for their necligence in her education, and her selfe but laughte at in the companie of wise and discrete dames, and that (which worse is) led by such guides into the botome les pit of euerlasting infamye: Remember thaduise of Mar∣cus Aurelius who writing of the slipper disposition of some women, with instruction to abridge the perentory humour which nature hath giuen theim, gyues this generall charge to all gouernours of nourceries & tutors of litle girles, that they stande so sewerly vppon the garde of thonnour of their charges, that they neither be sene out of windowes, stande as stales at the dore, suffred to visit any place of thordynarie hawnte of men, called to secrete conference without cōmis∣sion or companie of her keapor, but also barde thaccesse and presence of all men, for that (saith he) the ill can not be vtter∣ly preuented, onelesse the causes that maye procure it bée cleane taken awaie, neither is it possibe for a Lady to kepe the reputacion of her honor, that makes her selfe incidente to the hawnte of great companies, with desier to be a comō feast maker and visit euery banquet, and the more she is in∣nested with honor and high callinge, the more care is due to the preseruation of so great a title, and lesse libertie or licēce is enioyned her to raunge a broade or séeke to satisfie thap∣petit of her pleasure, and her falte of treble slaunder in the mouthes of the blasphemous nomber, which albeit is with∣out the compasse of my history, yet I thoughte it not vnmete to note this litle remembraunce, both to warne theim that vse lesse care, then is necessarie to preuente so greate a mis∣chiefe, and to wishe all Ladies to accompte their honour, as the gifte of god and speciall ornament of their life, whiche I
could enlarge with copie of authorities, if I had the assistāce of conuenient time, and consent of my historie, willinge me now to repaire to aniquette who perswadinge great impossi∣bilitie in a younge mayde of intisinge beautie desierus to enncownter thamarus glées of menne, and kepe cacquett with all comers, to escape eyther without some great falte in thabuse of her bodie, or at leaste to leaue occasion of sus∣picion and Ieleus opinion of her honestie, amonge suche as vse commonly to recorde the lyfe and doinges of greate La∣dies, loughte to preuente the like accidente with a contrary vertue, for keping her selfe (for the moste parte) within the house of her father, she barred thaccesse of Luchyn, and closed her eyes from the view of his presence, and if at some tyme her affaires required her to visitt the doare, and Luchyn (by lyke chaunce) reiterate his appeale with semblable somonce and salutacions of accustomed courtesie, she fixed her eyes vppon her worke, dissemblinge not to sée the thinge whiche her harte colde not brooke, and her eyes detested to beholde, and douting that vnder the vail of that masqued humilitie and kynde of courtinge not conuenient for her callynge, might lurke some secrete mischiefe and displeasure of doble consequence, she semed to abhor bothe the one and the other with equal detestacion, and conuerting his sighes into ayre, and teares to paye hym the hier of his follie, she seamed on∣ly to supplie the whole tyme of her beinge there, in the com∣panie of her companions, leauing pore Luchyn no lesse ama∣sed at theys newe toyes and trickes of a haggarde, then (at the first) he tooke pleasure, when she requited him with sem∣blable glée, al which notwithstanding colde neyther discour∣rage him frō the pursute of the resolucion of his mynde, nor put him in dispaire of his future fortune, thinckynge that time wold remoue the vaile of her rigour, and conuert her into a creature more plyable, assisted therin with thoppiniō of such as accompting smal conquest of things gotten with litle labour, do yelde the greateste glorie to that whiche is won with thertremitie of time and trauell.
And being still norished with the hope of victorie, renewed eftesones his purmenades & palewalkes affore herdoare, ad∣uauncing hym self so farfurth somtimes, that he entred in∣to deuise & discourse of loue, albeit so coldly, that the same neither declared thymportance of his desier, nor bewrayde the present passion of his minde, whereunto notwithstanding she gaue so slender regarde, that her replie dismissed him wt no lesse contentemente for the presente, then lykelihood of better successe hereafter. It is a custome amongest the Ieneueys and all the prouince about, that the young men, ha∣uing poeseys of flowers, and meting their mistresses in the stréetes or elswhere may present theym there with, without any mislike or cause of suspicion of the people, beyng also a note of no lesse curtesie, for the woman hauing flowers in her hande or bossome, to make lyke retourne to her seruant, whyche kynde of courtyng thamarus Luchyn forgatt not too prefer as a testey of hys seruice and furtherer of his sute, for watchynge longe tyme the hawnte of his mistres, he found her at laste not onely aloane and voyde of compainie, but in place conuenient to put his longe requeste vppon tear∣mes, whiche, gretinge of fortune or gifte of happie chaunce, yf it were welcomme to hym, I leaue it to the iudgemente of suche, as languishynge in the lyke disease, dare neyther discouer their gréefe, nor demaunde their due remedie, and hauynge (of purpose peraduenture) certeine Ielly flowers in his hande, whiche were of more price, because winter ra∣ged then with extremitie of coulde, the chiefeste enemye too flowers and tender boods on thearth, he saluted her with his requeste in this sorte. Yf the continuance of my seruice were hable to warrant Luchyne vvoeth Iani∣quaette. me at lēgth, the merite of the same, or the offer of any hope (in ye meane time) had vertue to procure moderatiō to my pas¦sion, the one shold not ende but by the sentence of death, and the other wolde I embrace as a speciall preseruer of my life, but seynge the one is of no lesse momente with you, then the other vnlikely too happen, I am dryuen to exclaime agaynste youre beautie, as the onelye cause of my gréefe,
and entire enemye to my rest, but chieflye thunnaturall ri∣gour which you suffered, to rampier hym selfe so depely in thintralles of your hart, and séele your eyes of compassion, agaynst me, that you will neyther admit, my teares, sighes, and other pitifull regardes without nomber, whereof the pale complexion of my face, with other trembling ioyntes of therterior partes, haue made sufficient declaracion, nor cre∣dit the infynit simptomes and thundringe alarams whiche the only glymmeringe viewe of your bewtie, ceasseth not to minister to the weake forces of my feble harte, who as your prisoner, ready to resigne the keyes and castel of his libertie, is heare becom the pitiful solycitor of his own cause, coniu∣ringe you by that compassion which ought to accompanie so rare and precious an ornamente of nature, to remoue at laste the vaile of youre former crueltie, and in beholdinge what power loue hath giuen you ouer me, to dismisse all de∣laies of comfort, and admit me into your seruice, that haue vowed neuer to departe out of the least of your commaun∣dementes, whereunto she was driuen to answere, rather by compulsion of the place and tyme, then any desyer to debate wyth him in a matter of such vanitie. The merite of your seruice (Sir sayth she,) is farr greater, then I can or may graunte his due méede, and your passion Ianiquetta aunsvvereth Luchyn. like to be restored by her that is ignorante of the cause, and lesse knoweth the order of your disease, And touchinge the reste of youre protestacion, coated rather withe ar∣gumentes of illusions and subtill cerimonies to seduce my simplicitie, thenne any resemblance of vertue or in∣tente to expose the frutes of true affection, I can not aun∣swere with other tearmes, then iuste disdayne of youre li∣berall offer, with litle care you vse to the reputacion of myne honour, neyther is it to me that you ought to addresse thys ambushe or traine of allurementes, considringe the in∣equalitie of our houses, denieth a consente of mariage, and to graunte loue to one that craues it in other sorte thenne thinstitucion of that sacred lawe dothe allowe, I thynke

The large feldes enuyronnynge the greate citie of Ieyne, seamed to lacke skoape and compasse to comprehende the multitude of thoughtes, wyth diuersitie of ymaginacions, that euen nowe, occupied the head of Luchin, who exclay∣mynge vppon the haggarde disposition of his mistres, for∣gatt not also to forge cause of complaint againste loue, for that as a blynde guide, he had ladd hym into the bottomles golphe of fancie, and leauyng hym there readie to be deuou∣red with the raginge waues of affection, wolde not showe him the waye to comme out, and eschewe so greate and pre∣sente a perill, albeit he oughte rather to haue reprehended his owne simplicitie, and weaknes of sprite, which (with the wante of assurance in vertue) made hym subiecte, to that, whiche all wise men oughte to gouerne with awe and correction, I meane the sensual appetites and prouocations of the fleshe, whiche are or oughte to serue, as slaues, to the place and house of our raison. Luchyn prolonging his passion with an increase of disquiet, seamed to fall from complaintes of dule, into tearmes of surye, and féedinge altogether vppon the hearbe and ap∣petit of rage, suffred hym selfe, to be so muche infected wyth the humor of frenzie, that his wrathe was turned into woddnes, wherein as the desperate louer doth seldome
measure his sléepe, by the length of the nightes, so he sea∣med here to excede the rauenous order of the gredie wolfe, huntinge his uncerteine praye in the darke, for som time he rolled vpon a bedd, and som time wallowed vpon the rushes in the flore, and now and then, for a chaunge of exercise, he tried the hardnes of the postes, with the knockes of his head, and albeit he had the libertie of a longe gallery, with fyue or six chambers to roue and ronne at his pleasure, yet iud∣ging the same not circuit sufficient to conteine the circum∣stance of his passion, he comitted one parte of his discourse to the witnes of ye ayre, within a faire garden, yelding pros∣pecte to the windowe of his gallery, where makyng inuoca∣cion to the moone (as the lanterne that then gaue lighte to the earthe) craued that she wolde open her vessells of pitie, and lette fall some droppes of consolacion in a showre of moysture, to quenche the burnynge heate of hys tormen∣tes, whyche he thoughte were thondred vpon hym, rather by the sentence, and dome of his angrie destenie, then as a desert and due merit of his owne follie, and being in dispair to dispatche hym selfe oute of that daunger, confirmed here by experience, the opinion of the Philosopher, who treating de Fragilitate humana, describeth the gates and fore fronte of the pallaice of mischiefe, to be paynted with allurementes and enticinge prouocations to enter, but beynge within, you fall (saithe he) ymediately into the pitte of tormentes, worse then the goolphe or lake of hell, nēyther can you haue saffeconduitt too retire at your pleasure, argewynge here∣by that it is farre easyer, to fal into the handes of daunger, then to purchasse a dispence of perill, and that the diseases bee more ordinarie and common, then the remedie readye to restore the patient. Yt was bothe pleasure and pitie, to here hym quarell with his fortune, wt complaint of hys mishap, somtime blamyng the simplicitie & faintnes of his corage, in yelding his harte prisoner, & hym selfe captiff to so meane a personage, and to

more in the lollynge of the nursse: then in the offer of A monarke. But nowe to Ianiquetta, who durynge the solitarie time, and desolate aboade of Luchyn, in his house, was maried by the trauell and assistance of her frendes, to a mariner or maister of a shipp, whose trade was to conueye the mar∣chantes of all partes, from porte to porte, as their traffi∣que and trade required: this mariage was no soner per∣formed in the churche, but fame fyllynge the eares of LVCHYN, made hym partaker of the newes, with aduyse to renewe the earneste of hys fomer bargayne wyth a doble diligence, and treble desyer, preferrynge (as it were) an assured hope of spedye victorye, the rather for that hée accompted the mariage a conuenient meane to couer the falte of his fowle desier, wherein he receyued a successe of his former attemptes, for she that detested hys indeuour, beyng at libertie, thoughte the offence of doble disposicion in offendynge God and the worlde in breakynge the league of her faith and vowe of obedience to her husbande▪ whose simplicitie and state subiecte to néede and lacke, Luchyn for¦gatt not to feede with large proffers of his frendshyppe, in suche sorte as what with the hope of his assistance, and feare of the authoritie he bare then in the citie, he had him (as it were) in a famyliar awe, neyther suspectynge his accesse too his house, nor mislikynge his conference with his wyfe, of whome notwithstandynge he coulde not obteyne but the vse of wordes, whyche as she durste not denye, for the respe∣cte of awe and honour whiche her husbande bare to hym, so hauynge a notable wisdome ioyned with her rare gifte of chastetie, reposynge her selfe in the grace of GOD, to de∣fende her honour, kepte his meanynge secrette, and woulde not communicate the fowlenes of his intente to anye and muche lesse to her waspishe husbande, leauynge in exam∣ple to all Ladies, not sufficiente in vertue, rather to re∣syste all suche alarams of theyme selues, or at leaste make a secrett concealement, then in bewraynge theyr
awne weaknes to breede a bées neste, in the heades of their husbandes wyth reaportes of small substance. But nowe the amarus traffique of Luchyn, and common haunte to the mariners house, began to bréede a doubt of his doing amongest his nearest frendes, who not knowinge of the mariage of IANIQVETTE, ymagyned what might hap¦pen, and (as careful gardeines of their nephewe) studied to preuent the wourste, wherfore leaste thalluremente of her bewtie and disposiciō of his follie, might vnhappely conclud, a secret contract betwene theym, they accosted hym one day wyth earnest request, that in ceassing at last to pursewe the wanton instigacions of his youthe, he wold crosse saile and retire to a trade of honest life, wherin saye they (verye loath The frendes of Luchyn persvvade hym to mary age and amendment of life. to offende hym) albeit we haue no great cause to infer ympu∣tacion of any haynous enormytie, or desorder not conueni∣ente, yet seinge the pleasante tyme of youre younge yeres slipp awaye, vnder a vaile of vaine and barreine life, whose sequeile (if in tyme you abridge not the race of your Ron∣ninge course) argues no small inconuenience to your selfe, with greate discredit to your deade father, we haue thought good to enter into deuise for preseruinge of that whyche yet remeines, and to preuent the malice of future tyme, where∣fore Honor and liuynge. accordyng to the credit, and resolued truste reaposed in vs, by your late father, the verye remembrance of whome, restores vs to a speciall care and zeale of youre honor and well doinge, we wishe you to conuert this ydle and desolate order of liuing, into a disposicion and desier of honest mari∣age, wherby you shall not only deceiue thexspectaciō of yt had sorte, deuyninge already of your destruction, but eschewe the sentence of ordinary mischiefe, appoynted to fall vppon suche, as wallowing in sensuall pleasures, regarde not the honor and estimacion of their house, and whiche appeares e∣uen readie, to thonder vpon you, if you dispatche not youre selfe of the principall cause of this great and ymynente mis∣fortune, wherin for a declaracion of the special care we haue
of you, we present you heare wyth a franke offer of our tra∣ueile, diligence and councel, to be ready at all tymes to assiste you in the choise of her, whom god shal enioyne you to make the lawfull com panion of your bedd. The younge man vnderstanding sufficiently their intent, cutt of their further discourse wyth hys promise, not onelye to make spedie exchaunge of his former trade, but also com∣mits hym selfe whollie to their discrecion and wysedomes, wyth resolucion to be ready to enter into mariage with such one, as they iudged, of equalytie, and euery way cōuenient for his condicion & calling, wherin there was such expedici∣on of diligence vsed by his frendes, that wythin a space of two or thre monethes, he was maried, no lesse richely, then honorablie, and to a bewtie sufficient to contēt a reasonable man, whereof if any reioyced wyth good cause, I thinke it was poore Ianiquette, who perswadinge herselfe, to be ryd by thys meanes of an ymportunat clyent, blessed the good¦nes of her fortune, in prouidinge so well for thennemye of her honor, and deliueringe her wyth honestie from ye daun¦ger of hys charmes, albeit her conceyte was aunswered wythe a contrarye successe. And as our nature for the moste parte now a dayes is gro¦wen to such corruption, by a contynual desier of filthie gaine Nothing  sausfye the couetuss of man. that (as Aristotle sayth) nothing is hable to satisfye the coue∣tusnes of man, Euenso thinfection of loue (after hee haue once preuayled aboue the wholesome partes in vs) is of suche wonderfull operacion that he doth not only, choke the gift of our vnderstanding, in suche sort as we are founde more apte to embrace the thinges that be hurtfull, then ha∣ble to followe the loare of wisedome and vertue, but also takes awaye the respect and dutie of our conscience, whyche you may easely descerne in the discurse of thys Luchyn, who notwithstandinge the vowe he made to god, and honor that euery man ought to geue to mariage, cold not content hym selfe, wyth the companye of his owne wyfe, but renewed hys resorte wythe alarames of freshe ymportunyties to
poore IANIQVETTA, whyche being noted and spied diuers times of his wife, made her doubt that which was not, and albeit she was resolued of a participacion and equalitie of loue, yet she feared not muche that the mariners wife, de∣ceiued her of any thinge that she accompted due to herselfe, for that the common reaport of her chaste and honeste life, assured her of the contrary, chieflye she repined that so vaine a hope, shoulde wythdrawe hym from her companye, feling wyth all a certeine wante in thaccomplishment of the exer∣cise and desier of the bedd at hoame. And truly as there is nothing more hurtful to the breach of amytie betwene the good man and wife, then when the stronger parte, conuertes his affection confirmed by vowe, The husbād into a disposicion and desier to abuse the vertue of true loy¦altie, So, he that huntes thappetit of his will, and raun∣geth after chaunge of diot hauing sufficient at hoame, stan∣des not onely in hazarde of grace afore god, for vyolacion of wedlocke, but giuinge occasion to his wyfe to followe hys tracke, reapes now and then for rewarde, the iuste title and surname of a cockolde, bequeathinge besides to the successi∣on of his house a dowry of perpetuall slaunder, whyche is skarcely subiect to the expyracion of tyme. Hys wyfe Layd afore hym the whole circumstance of his falte, with the generall brute that passed dayly thorowe all the stréetes of IEYNE, together with the wronge he did to the reputacion of the poore IANIQVETTA, whose honestie (saith shée) albeit is without iust cause of reprehencion, yet haue you broughte it in question amongeste the slaunde∣rous sorte, whose iudgementes are alwayes accordinge to the mallice of their disposicion, desieringe him for ende, in dismissinge his former trade, to wythdrawe his accesse, least he purchased not the like preferment for him∣selfe, that he sought to procure to an other, to whome albeit he could not denye the frendeshippe he bare to IANEQVET∣TA, yet he excused the same not to ymporte any preiudice
to the behalfe of his wyfe, wyth further protestacion, that IANEQVETTA was one of the paragons of honestie, that our age did norishe, and the respect of her vertue, was thon∣lye cause of his admiracion, procuringe chieflye his recourse The bable of of the people is rather of custome then of creditt. and desier of her companye, for the rest (sayth he) the bable of the people, is rather of custom then of credit, and the clere¦nes of my conscience, takes awaye the spott of reproche, if any be, neyther can the mouthe of the slaunderor preuaile, where the integretie of the mynde offers to encounter his malice, desieringe her to dismysse the remembrance of her grudge, wythe a forgeuenes of the falte, promissinge her from thinstante, to correcte the humor of his former follie, and become suche one on her behalfe, as her honest modestie and other vertues deserued, wherewyth he closed so sewer∣ly the mouthe of his wyfe, that longe after he liued frée from the tumulte of suche quarrells, and she (not voyde of suspici∣on) dispused her selfe, to contentmente by force, with ex∣spectacion to sée an ende of the daunce, thexpedition wherof, exceded her ymagynacion, for wythin a shorte tyme after the maryner, makynge sayle into Sardynia, was incowntred by certeine pirottes, and sente prisoner to CALLARIA a towne subiect to the turkishe gouernmente, wyth no small desolacion to hys wyfe, who as one depriued of her chiefeste stay and comforte, and ouercharged wyth a nomber of litle children, whose sustentacion depended whollie vppon the trauell of their father, is nowe voide of meanes to succor theym, and that whyche pinched more greuouslye, was the generall darthe ye ouerwhelmed al the Lande in such sorte that a sacke of corne, was seldome solde vnder nyne or ten Duckattes, whyche arguynge greate distresse to the state of poore IANIQVETTA, chiefelye for that shée was denied habylitye to redeme her husbande, and also in dispair of meanes to releue her children, cryinge contynuallye for meat, began to prefer in her a faintnes of corage, and ye hart
whom the whole assaltes of loue, and longe importunityes of Luchyn, his greate presentes and proffers, with promisses of large price, coulde not once stirre or remoue from the seate of constancie, feles nowe suche an alteracion of for∣tune, that she is at pointe to surrender (of her selfe), that, whiche neyther power nor pollecie coulde put to vtterance. And albeit the extremitie of her case ministred persuaciōs to make an offer of her selfe to hym that of longe had ser∣ued her in harte, wyth sute for her good wyll, yet the grudge of so greate an offence, preferrynge argumentes to the contrary, wylled her rather to exchaunge her pre∣sente lyfe and former reuowme wyth death, then liue with the spott of so fowle an acte, wherin waighinge thus in the ballance of doubteful ymaginaciōs, pinched extremely wyth two of the greatest plages of the world, the lamētable noyse of her children, cryenge for foode with open mouth, as the younge birde in the rooffe, complayninge in his kynde vp∣pon hunger, till he receiue refreshinge at the beake of his damme, ronge of freshe in her eares, whiche preferred suche cōpassion to the tender harte of the desolate mother, that on∣ly their rage and infirmitye forced her to a determinacion of that whiche earste she detested to remember, a meruelous force sewer of necessitie, who as she is the mistres of artes, so her malice importes suche a distresse, that it makes vs many tymes abuse the goodnes of our nature, in commit∣tyng thynges whiche neither honor nor conscience can iu∣stifye, for what greater mischiefe coulde she haue thondred vppon this pore woman, then in depriuynge her of natu∣rall and womanlȳe shame, to compell her to make sale of her honor, for the susteine of her selfe, and supporte of her miserable children, whose doleful tunes exclayming against their wretched mother that had not to satisfye the rage of their hunger, restored her eftesones to suche pitie, that she addressed her selfe, immediately to the lodgynge of Luchin, who walkinge all alon in his base courte, was no lesse asto∣nyed to see her ther, then she ashamed to be at the point, to
yelde him a villanous homage, yf god had not bene the pro∣tector of her chastetie. And beynge affore him with face and garmentes besprente and dyed with the droppes of her wa∣tery eyes, she fell flatt at his féete, yelding her honor to hys orde vnder thies tearmes. Albeit (sir) saieth she, the prince or capteine, that hathe often somoned his enemye to surrender his hold, and he (de∣nienge suche offers) dothe merteyne the quarrell euen vn∣till Necessetie forceth Iani∣quette to offer her selfe in praie to Lu∣chyn. thextreme sentence of warre, which is fyer or famine, ys forced at laste to strike saile and hange oute a flagge of sub∣mission, maye (by all lawe of armes) put hym to the sworde, and his citie to vtter saccage, yet the glorye of that conquest will appeare greater, and honour the capteine with tre∣ble fame, if in preferryng compassion affore the rigour of iustice, he admitt the captiues to fauour, sparing to spill the blood of suche as willinglie yelde their heades to the blocke vnder the stroke and edge of his sworde, neither is any man (of what degree so euer he be) of suche commendacion ey∣ther for hys corage, bowntie or other qualities and ornamē∣tes of nature, as worthelye honored wt veneration for the gifte of compassion and pitie, whiche as it is a vertue exce∣dynge all the reste, so (by the aduise of the scripture) shee is chiesly to be declared on the behalfe of such wretches, as fal∣len into daunger and distresse, by offendynge the prince or his people in office, haue nothing to preuent the malice of ye lawe and iuste méede of their deserte, but thexpectācion and hope in the frutes of so precious a vertue: I saye thusmuch (sir) to sturr vpp your humor of compassion, and dismissing the remembrance of all offences paste, to extende presente pitie to your poore Ianiquette, who if euer she offended you, is here come to yelde her to your mercie, and takynge suche vegance as you thynke good, to ymploye her further in the seruice that beste maye lyke you, onely I commende vnto your goodnes, the wretched state of my children, whose miseries accompained with a contynuall crye for releeffe, hath here presented me prostrat at your féete, kissing ye same
with no lesse humylitie, then signe of submission wythe re∣quest eftsones to accept the offer of youre hande mayde, in recompence of the wronge I haue heretofore don you, but chiefly (alas) to redeme my children from the rage and vyo∣lence of hounger, and prolonge their lyues that oughte not yet to take ende by the Lawe and course of nature. Here loue and pitie seamed to quarrell wythin the harte of Luchyn, the one puttinge the praye into his handes, pro∣uoked Luchyn ab∣stained from vyolacion of Ianiquetta. hym to croppe the frutes of his longe desier, the other defendinge the cause of the wretched captiue, preferred per∣swacions to the contrarye, puttinge hym in remembrance, yt the glory can not bée greate, where the victorye is won by vnlawfull meanes, neyther colde hée tryumphe in a better conqueste, then, in ouercommynge hym selfe, to dismisse her wythout vyolacion, wherfore comparing her former con¦stancie, with the extreme causes that procured her presente offer, respectinge also the duetie of hys owne conscience, did not only determyne to assiste her pouertie wyth succor of sustentacion, but also to absteine hys handes from deflow∣ringe, so rare aparagon, wherewyth hée tooke her from the grounde, & kissing her watery chieke, sayde vnto her, do a∣waye these teares of dule, and conuert the remembrance of auncient sorowe, into an vnfayned hope of present console∣cion, Luchyn cōp¦forteth Iani∣quetta. reapose your selfe vpon the vertue of your inuincible chastetie, and ymagyne you haue receiued the due meritte of the same, for, for my parte, god forbidd, that the malice of your presente necessitie (yeldynge you into my handes) shoulde make me gréedie to get that, whyche loue colde not conquere, nor spole you of the thinge whych I oughte and will holde in chiefe veneracion, wherin being thus by your vertue made maister of my self, I fele also mortefied in me the wanton suggestions, which earst moued me to loue on∣ly the bewtie and body of Ianiqueta, and now that reason is be come my guide and distresse rather then loue, hathe made you thus prodigal of your honor, for the sustentacion of your children, yt shal suffice me, to haue you at my cōmandemēt
withoute anye affore of wronge to your estimacion or ho∣nestie, And as your chastetie doth challenge her rewarde, so because it is you that is to glory in the gifte of so greate a vertue, and I to yelde tribute, for that treason I haue wroughte you, I assure you here in the mouthe of a gentle∣man, not onely to furnish you of all thinges necessarie, with honor and estymacion equall to myne owne sister, but also to be as carefull of your reputacion, as heretofore I haue sought to seduce and spot it with lasciuious infamy. Ianiquetta was restored here to doble contentment, bothe to haue her pudicitie respected, and vndowted assurance of the liberal promisse of the curteous Luchyn, whych she would eftsones haue acknowledged with an humble prostitucion and kissinge of his féete, but that he (not liking such supersti∣cious reuerence), preuented her intente, and presented her by the hande vnto his wife, wyth these wordes Because the conceite of the Ieleus mynde, is seldome Luchyn pre∣senteth Iani∣quetta to his vvyfe. satisfyed, til the cause of the suspicion be cleane taken away, and that the grudge is neuer appeased, till thoffendor be pu∣nished, I, haue here broughte you, the cause of your greatest doubt, with the vision that so many nightes, hathe appered in your dreame, and broken the swéete course of your na∣turall sléepe, enioyninge you full authoritie, to commit her to what penance you will, giuinge the stroke of vengance at your own discrection, to whom she aunswered, that if she had no more cause to be doubtfull of his doinges, then rai∣son to bée Ielous of the honestie of the poore woman, she had béene as frée from suspicion as far frō cause of disquiet, ney¦ther had her eyes anye cause to complaine of thimpediment of sléepe, nor her braine so often assailed wyth the Alaram of hollowe dreames, for thexperience and proofe of her vertue (sayth shée) dyd alwayes assure mee of her honestye, whyche yett wyll not stowpe to the malice of thée tyme, nor loase the glorye of her renowmée, althoughe fortune haue layde her heauye hande vppon her, in takynge
a waye her husbande, whiche temperat modestie in hys wyfe, doubled his affection, with confyrmation of a sin∣cere good wyll towardes her for euer. And in recitinge the laste chaunce and discourse passed betwene hym & Iani∣quette, he saide that if she knewe in what sorte, he had kepte his fayth towarde her, she woulde not doubte to put hym on the phile of moste true and loyal husbandes, willynge her to take her & furnishe her with all prouision and other thinges necessarie with no lesse care and liberall allowance, then if it were for his deare sister, whereunto she put no lesse expe∣dicion, then her selfe had cause to reioyce in the honeste continencye of her husbande, all whiche beinge made im∣mediatly a common brute thorowe the citye, became also of greate wonder amongest the people, aswell for that thin∣stigation of harde necessitie, had made Ianiquette ployable to that, which she hath longe refuced with great detestation, as also for the heroicall vertue of the gentleman, who abhor∣ring the wicked offer of fortune and time, conuerted his las∣ciuious desier, norished in his intralles, by so longe conty∣nuaunce, into a disposicion of vertue, contrarie to the exspe∣ctation of all men. An example suer worthie of greate veneracion, and wher∣in the sensuall appetites are so restrayned, and gouerned by the rule of raison, that I doubte whether the Romaines, haue noted more continencye in their Fabia, Emilya, or Scipyo, or the Grecians in theyr olde Xenocrates, who is not so merito∣rious of cōmendation, for that being charged with yeres, he Xenocrates refused a yōg maid layed in bedd vvith hym. made a proffe of his chastetie, as this Luchin who in ye glorie of his age, and full of the hoatt humours of youth, made a conqueste of his affections, wyth a wonderfull showe of vertue, and vndoubted signe and assurance of the perfe∣ction of his fayth, for whych cause I haue noted vnto you his hystorye, which also I wyshe myghte serue to sturre vpp the fraile youthe of our dayes to the ymitacion of the lyke vertue, remembryug by the viewe of this discourse, that
the sensuall appetites and prouocation of the fleshe, are not of suche force, but they are subiecte to correction, neyther is loue so inuincible, but the wise and vertuous man, maye kepe hym alwayes in awe, so that he giue hym not to muche libertye at the first, nor creaditt to muche the instigation and humour of his owne fan∣cie. FINIS.
The argument WHose youth and yeres of folly, haue made an experience of the dispositi∣on of loue, and suche as he infecteth with hys frantike poyson, tryenge in like sorte the difference betwene the vanities of the worlde, and the con∣templacion of celistiall thinges, or other vertues of diuyne operacion vpon earthe, openinge (as it were) to all degrees of mortalytie an entrey or way to come to the glorye and honor of theuerlastinge Paradise aboue: to suche (I saye) maye I boldely appeale, for con∣firmaciō of thauncient opynion grounded in the stomakes of men from the beginning, that the bewtie and flattering behauiour of a woman, is the true and natural Adamant, seing that, that stoane, (by a certeine vertue attractiue, and speciall gifte by nature) hath not such power to force and drawe the heauie yron vnto it, as the secret misterie, hyd∣den in the eyes and face of a woman, are of authoritie, to sommon and steale thaffections and hartes of men: which hath wrought a resolucion, or thinge of most certeintie a∣mongest a nomber of men now a dayes, that such charmes and serpentine allurementes, were sente a mongeste vs frome aboue aswell to tormente our pleasure, as also (in sōe sort) to geue ease to thafflictiō of such as are vnhappe¦lie contrybutors to that poysoned participacion: wherin as we haue long marueiled why Parys forsoke the delites of Troye, to become the thrall of Helene in greece, what mo∣ued one Hercules to abandon his beauye mase, and clubb of conquest, to depende whollye vppon the commaundement of his women frende, or howe Salomon, abused the gifte of his wisedome, to commit follie, with her, who only gouer∣ned him, yt guided the whole monarkye, so, behold I haue
to encrease your wonder with a true portrayte or picture, of a more force in a woman, and folly in a man, who, with out any vse of former or hope of future fauor, sauinge to fullfill the fonde appetit of his folishe mistrys, habando∣ned the vse and benefytt of his speche for thre yeres, put∣ting on (by that meanes) the shapp of brutalitie, betwene whom and the creatures of vnderstandinge, the philoso∣phers conclude an only difference of the vse of reason, and speache. A case (sewer) no lesse notorious for the rary∣tie that waye, then declaringe a singuler force of nature in the subiect vpon whom shee seames to bestowe suche prehemiuence aboue all other misteries vppon earth, whereof maye serue for sufficiente proofe theffeminate alteration in Hercules, the decrease of strengthe in Samp∣son, the losse of wisedom and vnderstan∣dynge in Salomon, and the simpli∣citie of this gentle∣man, whose dis∣course folo∣weth.
THE CRVELTIE OF A Wydowe in enioyninge her woer to a pen∣nance of thre yeres losse of his speache, the foolish loyaltie in hym in performinge her commaundemente, and the meane vvher∣by he was reuenged of her rigour. ❧. AMongeste the lymytrophall townes con ynynge the borders of Pyemount, no man dowtes (I thinke) that the Ci∣tie of THVRYN, beinge thonly lan∣terne to geue light to al the prouinces there about, for eiuill orders and inte∣gritie of conuersacion, is not also, a chief rampier and sewer bulwarke to her owne countrey, agaynst thincur∣cion of enemyes, neyther is it of lesse estimacion for the na∣turall scituacion of the place, then bewtified greatly by thin dustrius endeuor of man, addinge (as it seames) a more deco∣ratiō of late to that towne, then eyther nature or the slender deuise of men in tymes passed colde ymagyn. Somewhat without the suburbes of this riche and populus Citie, is planted in a pleasant valley, a little village called Montcall, worthie euery way to be ioyned in neighbourhead to so great a Citie, being inuironed on thone side wt the fra∣grant ayre of the fertil feldes al to bedewed with the sondry swete smelles of thincense of Aurora, & on thother side with ye loftie hilles, breathing from the mouth of Zephire the ayre of health, to refresh in time of nede the drowsie tenants of the valley, which (amongest other happie influences of the hea∣uens) semed also to haue aspecial fauor of the godes, to bring furth and norish the most faire, verteous, curtoyse ladyes
yt cold be foūd in any one corner of Europe, amōgest whō not withstāding there was not long since a young widow called Zilya, who declyning frō ye dispositiō of ye clymat and planet of her natiuitie, became so hagarde lyke, and enclyned to crueltie, that she semed rather to take her begining, among the desertes and craggie places of Scauoye, then too sucke the brestes of the delicat norsses in the pleasante champayn, re∣freshed by the beautifull hande of Erydan, sometyme called the father of ryuers, and nowe termed by the title of Po, whose christall channells and siluer streames, (deuydynge theym selues into diuers distillinge brokes) do not onelye driue men into admiration, but also draw theym to become neighbours to alicour of suche delite. This disdainefull wydowe, and enemye to all curtesie, al∣though she hadd asyet skarcely entred into the twentie and fourthe yere of her age, yet she perswaded her selfe herafter to abandon vtterly the societie of man, whether it were by mariage or otherwaies, aduowing to spende the remeynder of her yeres in singlenes of lyfe, a resolucion (truly) bothe godly and commendable, yf the tiklishe motions of the fraile fleshe, woulde be contente to obey, the wholsome exhorta∣cions of the sprite. But whereas our declynyng bodyes pampred in all de∣licacye, together with the vnruly appetites, ragynge after wilfull desier, doo seme to quarrell with our chastetie, and vanquishe all resistance, the councell of thapostell is to bée followed, who willes that we marie in christe, to auoyed the daunger of the sowle, and common slaunder of the world: she also after she had alredie performed the due debte of her dutie to the deade bodye of her husbande, whome she accom∣payned to the graue with abundance of teares and other funerall dule, soughte not (accordyng to the trade of young wydowes now adayes lefte without controlmente) to abuse the benefitte of her libertie, or dispose the tyme of her widowehead in other exercise, then in augmentacion, of the patrimonye lefte to her litle sonne, and enryche her selfe

For the office of a mother or mystres of families, consistes The charge of a mistris or gouernor of housholde. not only in kepyng her seruantes to continuall trauaile, or taking accompte of their doings and daies labour, but stret∣ching further, she is enioyned (according to thaduise of Sa∣lomon) to a straiter charge, to assiste thindeuors of her peo∣ple, with the helpe and diligence of her owne bodye, seynge her aduise is no lesse necessarie for ye perfection of the worke, then her presence and help therein a speciall incitacion, en∣coraginge the seruantes, not to desiste from toile, till their taske be performed, and that to thexspectacion of her desier, neither ought any degrée with be dispenced all, from honest exercise, seyng thymitacion of trauell, is deryued from our sauior Christ, who exposing his body to al toile, grudged not to vndertake those painful endeuors, which thappostells re∣fused to endure, leauing an example to al estates, to ymitat honest toile, (which by the mouth of thappostell he dowteth not to terme a singuler vertue) promising a rewarde of per petuytie, with a contynuall reste in the bosom of Abraham, to those that vnfeynedlye do folowe it. But towchynge those delicate and wanton housewiues, whiche thinke their estymacion ympaired, if they but put their noses within the aire of painefull indeuor, they I saye, beyng hurtefull to a whole common wealthe, oughte either to be vtterly weded

Which vertue if it bée to be honorred, for the arietie in our dames now a daies, yet had she another gifte of no lesse com∣mendacion, whiche she semed not to attaine vnto without the helpe of thegipcians theologie, who resoluing vpon cer∣teine honeste partes, whiche ought to adorne the beautye of a vertuouse & chast womā, haue drawen thimage of a womā holding a keye affore her mouth, and her féete vpon a whele, notinge thereby, that an honest womā, hath always her lip∣pes locked, & her toung tyed, to thend she vtter no wordes of

But now as this wydowe had layde her hus∣bande in his longe bedd of reste, there to remeine vntill the generall resurrection of all fleshe, the dollorous disposition of her funerall dule retired into obliuion, and she whollye giuen to treade the path of painefull toile, aswel for the su∣stentation of her selfe and her charge, as increase of the pa∣trimonie lefte to her litle sonne, it chaunced that a gentle∣man of the moste estimacion of that contrey called Mon∣sieur Phillibarto Virley, whose house was nexte neygh∣bour to Montcall, came vppon a holly daye or greate feaste to Montcall, & beinge in the churche there, in place of occu∣pyinge

But duringe the time of the sermon and all, the matutinall prayer, our vnhappie Phillyberto waered in contrarietye of thoughtes, reseruynge notwythstandyng his eyes assured∣ly and firmly fixed vpon her, who makes no more accompte of theim that regarde her wyth suche greate admiration, then they theim selues of their liues and libertye, commit∣tynge rashelye twoo suche precious Iewels, betwene the merciles handes of so cruell a woman, of whose estate con∣dicion, trade, and order of lyuynge, this newe enamored Virley, (beinge comme from the churche to his lodging), for∣gatt not to make diligent inquisition, which (as oyle to light his matche) retourned vnto him a generall reaporte of her honestie, wherein beinge confirmed by the mouth of euery man, he made no conscience, immediatlye to proclayme her the soueraine Ladye of his lyfe, and thonly disposer of his secret thoughtes. And yet amongste the sondrie commendacions gyuen to her vertues, he was made tunderstande by secret information He vvas made understande of thinciuili tye of the vvydovve. of some his deare & familyar frendes, of thinciuilitie wyth certeine vnsemelye pointes of vnnaturall discourtesie raig∣nyng in her, whiche albeit suspended his: resolution for a tyme, occupying his doubtfull mynde, with varietye of co∣gitacions, yet seinge his destynie had alredye enioyned him to be a thrall to her beautye, for the whiche he had alredye put his lybertye as a pawne betwene the handes of hym, who hauynge once gotten the hartes of men within the iu∣risdiction Loue. of his durance, will not release their imprison∣ment, nor restore their libertye, so sone, nor when they wishe it, he determined to pursewe thende of his enterprise, committyng hym selfe to be guyded by the fauor of fortune, and the successe of his indeuor to ye good wil of loue, who lea∣dyng hym thorowe the blynde vale of vaine hope, and tick∣lynge hym by certeine argumentes or likelihodes of good spede, to make hym mery for the tyme, wyth the conceite of his owne phantasie, willed hym to put hys intente vp∣pon tearmes, whereby, and wyth the continuance of his
long seruice, he semed to assure him, at last to wreste the good wil of the wydow to thappetite & exspectation of his desyer, wherein for his firste entrye into his laborinth of miserable toyle, he committed thorder of his owne house at Virley, and affaires of importance to the direction of others, and deter∣mined his abode at Montcall, to thende, that if in plātyng his batterye, nor with thassistance of thuttermost of his force, he coulde make no reasonable breache into the forte whiche he ment to assaile, in the wynnyng wherof him selfe was most in daunger to be first taken, yet at the least, he might recreat and solace hym selfe, with the contemplacion of an ymage of so rare and excellente beautye, the remembrance whereof, seamyng rather to double his gréefe, then giue moderaciō to his passion, serued more to stirre vp the malice of that poiso∣ned humour of loue, then to repulse the furie of his newe fe∣uer: And lastely preferring absolute argumēts of his peren∣torye destructiō, offred diuers likelihodes of future disquiet, for the latter remeinder & residue of his yeres yet to cōme. And being now becōme a Citizen of Montcal, he begā to haūte the church aboue his ordinarie, not so much peraduēture, for any feruēt zeale he had to prayer or inuocation to god, as for the amarus deuociō he oughte to his newe saint, whose pre∣sence, albeit he could not enioye, but in the body of ye church, & that in times of preaching & publique seruice of the Lorde, yet did he refraine to make the house of God, a place to com∣municat his practis of loue, persuading him self, thoffence to be to heynous to defile the sacred temples & holly places, de∣dicated to the highest, with any spot of villanie, and specially with attemptes of such folly, being chieflye forbidden by the mouth of our sauiour, Domus mea, domus orationis vocabitur, my house shalbe called the house of praier, & not a den for a∣dulterers or theues, nor place to practise any iniquitie or synne, wherein albeit the zeale of Religion forbadd hym to vse conference wyth her in the churche, yet the pear∣cing stinge of affection, openyng hym an other meane, putt hym in remembrance to attende duelye her commynge out, where, with greate humilitye he offred his seruice often
tyme in beynge her guyde to her lodgyng, whiche as he for∣gat not to performe, with al the curtesie and semly behauior he colde ymagyn, so notwithstandinge al the vehement per∣swacions he colde inferre for thaccōmplishment of his desier, yet reaped he thereby no more contentemente nor meanes to qualefie his greeffe, then she tooke pleasure in hearinge the discourse and loyall offer of his vnfayned good will, for she, as a cruell enemye to curtesie, faynyng not to vnder∣stande what he sayde, replied to all his allegacions of loue, wyth some conference of housewiuerye or housekepyng, wherewith, tornyng the carte against the horse, he became no lesse amased at her ouerthwart reasons, then she seamed to take pleasure in the teares of his complayntes, whyche argewed not only colde compforte in the sute of the wooer, but also ymynent occasion of hys owne destruction, yf by thassistance of some other meane, he auoyded not with expe∣dicion, the sondrie illes that threatned to thunder vpon him, wherefore deuising certeinne banquettes and gossep me∣tynges at hys lodging, of diuers of the burgess wyues of that towne, he entred thereby into the good opynion of cer∣teine dames, that were no lesse familiar with the rigerous ZILYA, amongest whom he chused out one whose bossome he thoughte to make the regester of his secret, with entente to impart with her, both the cause of his dollor, & the meane to mitigate the same in bewrayinge hys gréeffe to her, that was the fountaine and occasion of his presente passion: to her then (beyng his nexte neyghbor) no lesse subtill of her owne inclynacion, then well experienced in suche affaires, neyther ignorante what dishe they féede vppon that sitt at the table of loue, nor what bitter taste those brathes comon∣ly haue which cupide brueth for his guests, he addresseth him selfe, coniunynge her in the firste place of his preamble, too make councel of the cause of hys cōplainte, wherwt entring into the discourse of his loue, conceiles nowithstandyng the name of his ladie, vntill he hard the annswere of his neigh∣bour, who perceiuynge alredie the marke whyche he shott
at, offred him frankelie her helpe, to thuttermoste of her power, whereof she gaue hym assurance by promisses of large skope, that inconsideracion of the honestie, whiche she had noted in hym hitherunto, she wolde not faile to bestowe her endeuour euerye waye, to thaduancement of his desier, wherein (sir) saieth she, although my offer seame more libe∣rall on your behalfe then your meanynge plaine vnto me, yet I hope you will conster my wordes to an honeste ende, and not abuse the readynes of my inclinacion to do you good in any trauell of reasonable consequence, where in it shal please you to employ me, to whom this careful knight, after he had giuen her ye choice of a thousand thanks, & perswaded her eftesones to a secretnes touching his practise (fearynge yet to disclose the name of his mistres) roued at her in thys Seigneur phil liberto vvoeth his neighbor to solicite his loue to zylia dark manner: my case alas, saith he differeth, not much frō ye condition of the pollitike capteine, who goyng aboute to giue thassalte to a fortresse or place of defence, beyng care∣ful to kepe his soldiours frō slaughter or the ochers owle, planteth his ordinance & battery in the face of the forte, to thende that the place beinge made assaltable by the helpe of the Cannon, the soldiours maye more saffelie giue charge vpon the walles, and performe the exspectation of their cap∣teyne, euenso, for my parte, hauinge drawen a greate deale of tyme to ende in the longe siege of a forte, no lesse strong, then the stonnye rocke, whose hardnes resistyng the force of all shotte, makes also lyke accompte of the valiante corage of my soldiours, whereof I haue alredye loste the greatest nomber, in diuers skirmishes giuen me by my pleasante enemye, am driuen in thende, to flee vnto you for helpe, for the performance of this warr, to thende that with thassi∣stance of your councel and trauaile, I may be hable to make an approche, and entre the place whyche hetherunto hathe repulsed all my assaltes But she not hable to conster the mistery of his comparaison, desiered hym to committ the meanyng of his ridle, to tear∣mes of playner vnderstandynge, for sayeth she (some what
smylynge) I was neuer norished amongest the oracles or dreame readers of auncient tyme, nor tasted of the conning of Edipus, neyther haue I muche bene traded in the exercise of warr, or acquainted wyth the vse of armes, a thynge impropre and farr vnsemely for our secte. To whome he replied in fewe wordes, that the laborinth of that warre, whiche he mente, was no lesse naturall then common, nei∣ther doubte I (saith he) but some tyme in youre lyfe, you haue proued what traines maye be vsed to entrapp the en∣nemy, wyth what canuisadees the trenche maye be soddain∣ly inuaded, what secrett ambushes maye be layde, to van∣quishe force by pollecie, and what meanes are to be vsed euery waye, aswell by thassailant as defendante. Whereunto she aunswered with a semblable similitude, de∣riued The aunsvver of his neygh∣bour. of the like occasion chieflye to encorage this fainte sol∣diours to continue his new warre, saying, that as far as she coulde discerne, there lacked nothing but thassurance of the felde, seinge (saieth she with a familiar showe of pleasante cheare) we are alredye in pointe to entre the combat, and albeit all your pollecie, in deuisinge bulwarkes, square and rounde, mountes of greate heighte and well rampired, are not hable to batter the place, and the subtill mynes vn∣der the earth, and other mertiall engines lacke force against the strength of the ennemy, nor in no sorte to fauor your en∣terprise, nor your trēnches artificiallie made, prickt full of perillous flankars, are hable to amase the capteine of the forte, no nor the sondry terrible assaultes gyuen by your de∣sperate soldiors, will procure eyther parley or composition, yet (saieth this mery dame,) let vs not rewarde oure longe warre with a shorte shame, nor sell the glorye of so great a victorye for so vile a price, as faintnes of corage, but let vs eftesones renewe the conflicte wyth freshe supplies, and sende to somon the forte by the mouth of the Canon, whose message I warrant you, the capteine will not denye. Albeit because in plainlye vnderstandynge your intente, I maye frankely imploye my endeuour, I praye you dis∣misse
thies darke Apothegmaes of warr, and open your mea∣nyng simplie, for I greue on your behalfe, to sée you conuer¦ted into suche alteracion, whyche makes you séeme vtterly to degenerate from your auncient modestie and wisdome, whereof he desiered her not to merueile, seynge that accor∣dynge to the dispocition of the accidente, the condicion and state of men do commonly chaunge and alter, for I am be∣come (sayth he) subiecte and bownde to one that hath made me in none other takinge, then those vnhapie wretches that be tormented with deuiles, who as they can neyther saye, nor do any thing, but by the permision of the sprite that pos∣sesseth theym, Euenso, this cursed enchaunter loue hathe gott suche power ouer all the partes in me, that he alone commaundes me by power and authoritie, and I obey by awe and feare, he enioynes me penaunce at hys pleasure, and I endure the paine and dare not complaine, he alas pro¦mysed me contentmente, and nowe payeth me with doble annoye, he offred to assiste me, and leaues me in thextre∣metye of my distress, yea in place where I oughte to vse argumentes of moste audacitie, it is there that he depriues me of all corage, and leaues me withoute countenance, and beynge alone (god knowith) howe valyantly I inuade the place, which I darr skarcely behold wt open eye, when mine enemy is in presence, is it not pitie alas to sée on manne distressed with so manye diuerseties at one instante, proce∣dynge onely of the ragyng appetit of one symple affection? neyther wolde I grudge at the heauie burden of thyes pas∣sions, nor sticke to indure a thousande more euilles, if ey∣ther sufferance wolde make my seruice acceptable, or tyme purchase the merite of my martirdome? but where as there appeares nothynge but vncertentie, with argumentes euerye waye of euyll successe, and I in the meane tyme accordynge to the CAMELEON lyuynge with the breathe of the ayre, doo feede but vppon the offer of vayne yma∣ginacions, what is there to keepe me oute of the daunger

And trulye albeit diuerse women nowe a dayes, haue good cause to inueighe by complaintes against the disloyaltye of men, yet this Ladye whome you seme to honour so muche, hathe neyther cause to mislike her choice, nor reason to refuce the consent and offer of your seruice, where of as the earthe semes a verye nigarde, to brynge furthe and norishe so fewe of your disposition, so it can not be chosen, but pure loyaltye for lacke of harbor within the hartes of moste men, muste retire and seke her a newe habitacion, within the delicate intrailes of vs women, who embra∣cynge no lesse that vertue wyth deare affection, then desye∣rous to expose vnfained frutes of the same, are accompted to be cladde in the habite of crueltie, yf we séeme to stande vppon our garde, and expulse thassaulte, of that friuolus and fleshelye crewe of vaine louers, who profferinge theyr seruice vnder a masque of fayned teares, & sighes of double deceite, with other courtelyke importunytyes, do bende the pollecie of all their practises to none other ende, then to abuse the fauor whiche they fynde at theyr handes, that vn∣happelye committe their honor to the kepinge of those Syco∣phantes, and common enemies to the renowme of all Ladies. Ah good madam (sayth he) although my lytle hablenes de∣nies me sufficient meanes, to measure the rewarde of your franke offer, accordynge to the meritt of your great curte∣sie, yet beholde heare a soldiour and gentleman bounde to be no lesse prodigall of his lyfe, and spende the deareste dropp of his blodd in your seruice, then you seme liberal

This letter sealed and subscribed with his owne hande, he deliuered, not withoute abundance of teares, to his neygh∣bour, who promisinge hym once againe, to bringe him aun∣swere afore she slepte, went her waie, leauing the languish∣ynge knyghte, buildyng castels in the ayre, with a thousand hammors in his heade, & tickling him selfe to make himself laughe, semed sometime to bathe his sorowes, in the ioye and cōtentement which vaine hope offred him by visions in his flatteringe conceite, but when the lothsome ymage of the cruell inciuilitye of Zilya, presented her selfe in hys mynde, his pleasure retired into dule, with as manye argu∣mentes of presente death, as earste he ymagined liklihodes

Madame sayeth the messenger, the lytle Simpathia and equalitie of affection, whiche seames to be in you, in com∣parison of the vertues of him whose solicitor I am, hath mo∣ued I thinke this passion in you, notwithstandynge for my parte, beinge no lesse sorie for the presente affliction of Monsieur de Virley, then desierous to releue his distresse with thuttermoste of my indeuor, I haue vndertaken the charge of a messenger, to deliuer this letter (which then she takes oute of her pocket and giues to Zilya) vnto you, wherein as my fayth lieth in pawne, for the performāce of my promise, so I beseche you, on his behalfe, refuce not his presente, accompanied wyth a franke offer of his humble seruice, lyf, liuynge and all that he hath, to be imployed onelye at the becke of your commaundemente, wherein, if amongeste the other beatitudes or vertues giuen vs, by speciall name in the scripture, the actes of charitye, wyth indeuor to suc∣cour the afflicted, and giue consolation to the comfortles, be no lesse acceptable afore God then the reste, refuce not ma∣dame, to releue hym, who for your sake, hath loste his li∣bertye, languisheth in continuall dollor, and is redye for wante of reléefe at your hande, to take hys leaue of vs wretches in this worlde, wyth whiche iuste incitacions
to compassion, I ioyne also this requeste of myne, that if the deserte of my frendshypp, maye fynde place of fauor in you, you wyll, (the rather for my sake, open and reade the letter, retournynge your annswere by me, who hath vn∣dertaken no further but the deliuerie of the same, and rea∣porte your resolucion touchinge the contentes of his de∣maunde. Zilya, besides the crabbed inclination of her owne nature, beinge not acquainted wyth suche kinde of embas∣sages, and lesse wonte to be courted wyth requestes of the like courtesie, began here to enter into suche a disposicion of collor, that at the fyrste, she was readye to wreake her malice vppon the letter, committynge it into a thousande peces, and retourne the messenger without any aunswere, albeit reseruing by chaunce some sparke of modestie, which oughte to be incidente to all women, she opened and redds the contentes of her clyante, not without signes of greate alteracion in her face, arguynge lyuelye enoughe the con∣trarietie of thoughtes, which semed to quarel in her mind: for within lesse then a moment of tyme, she chaunged coolor twize or thrice, some tyme pale lyke the crosse of Dyana, whiche beinge set againste the sonne, loaseth by and by the glorye of his borowed lighte, and retourned immediatly to a crymsyne, not muche vnlike the florishinge dye of the fra∣grante rose, glisterynge in his orient coolour in the plea∣sant mournynges of the springe, notwithstanding hauyng redd and ouer red with thies alterations, the some of his de∣maunde, beinge not hable any longer to conceile or mode∣rate, the passion of her yre, clawed her neyghbour wyth this crabbed aunswere. I woulde neuer haue thoughte, that Zilia ansvve∣reth the mes∣senger. vnder the outwarde showe of your vertuouse conuersacion, whereof you haue bene no lesse noted, then commended by the mouth of all men hetherunto, had lorked suche foule frutes, of abhominable substance, and specially in a desier, to become a celecarier of letters in the fauor of loue, wherin as you haue semed to waighe the reputacion of your selfe, & the renowme of mine honor, in thindifferente ballance of
your owne lighte iudgemente, Euenso, if the lawe of frend shippe did not stopp my mouthe, and make me dissymule, that whych I thinke, or yf any other had bene the messen∣ger of thies affaires, I assure you, the publicacion of the facte, shoulde haue made her honour, no lesse notorius and subiecte to perpetuall infamye hereafter, then I seme to make deare accompte of my chastetie, which I woulde you shoulde knowe, is armed with more assurance, then to bée shaken with any assaltes of thies follies: wherefore if you be as carefull to liue in quiett withoute skandall hereafter, as I am absolutely resolued not to dimynish the title of my honor, by any acte of myne owne, lett this first falte diswade you, to wade any further in an enterprise of so small com∣mendacions, seyng that she that is eyther mynister or mes∣senger in these amarouse trafficques, or a furtheror of such practises of loue, is no lesse guiltie affore God and her con∣science, then yf she were eyther pillowe or bolster to the detestable facte. And for mine aunswere to Siegneur de Virley, whose demaund I deteste, no lesse then his follie deserues, yf he haue opened his eare to thinchauntment of loue, lett hym expulse then∣nemye with a countercharme, by raison, or elles make the best of his owne bargaine, for seynge hys disease commes of him selfe, let hym exspecte no consolacion at my hande, for I had rather be a frende to death, then fauour the leaste iotte of his demaunde, wherein for a confirmacion of my re∣solucion, I intende hensfurthe to barr hym al meanes of ac∣cesse to my presence, wherewith on my behalfe you maye salute hym. The lady messenger, seyng her selfe in this sorte clawed, where it itched not, & no lesse ashamed of her sharpe repulse, then sory yt her medicine, was of no better operacion, on the behalfe of her patient, semynge notwithstandyng to be litle moued with the angrie complexion of ZYLIA, desiered that God wolde reduce the difference and inequalitie of their di∣seases, into a Sympathia and equalitie of passion, I meane,
saieth she madame that you maye be taken oute of this con∣ceite of cruell disdaine, whiche makes you incapable of rea∣son, and he restored to his libertie, which he can not redeme, but by thastistance of your goodnes, wherewith she toke a shorte leaue and departed, and beynge arryued at the lod∣ging of her knighte, she founde him all plunged in extreme dollour, vpon a felde bedd, with more argumentes of death, then likelihods of lyfe, who, whether he felte some sygnes of yll lucke by the secrett instigation of his hart (whyche com∣monly preferres diuers conceites of feare, when the minde is occupyed with dowte) or whether the sorowefull counte∣nance of the messenger dyd signefie her yll successe in hys sute, or what it was, I can not tell, but as his neyghbour was entringe into the reporte of her aunswere, he stopped her mouthe, and preuented her meanynge with this excla∣macion The cōplaint of Seigneur Philiberto. followyng. What state is more wretched, then he, that lyueth dowtefull of hymselfe with dispaire of dispence from disquiett, by any assistaunce of tyme or other mediator on his behalf, who is wrapte in suche miserie, or hath more cause to complaine, then he to whom fortune hathe vowed a contynuāce of her malice, wtout hope to reclaime her fauor? is there any pennance greater, then to be punshed wt conti∣nual passion, or plage of more mortality, then to consume by pecemeale in ye flame of languishyng dule? Ah infortunat gentleman, how vnhappelie art thou fallē frō the felicitie of a lyfe ful of pleasant libertie, wt exchaung of thine auncient blysse, for a tribute of tormentes, more supportable then death, how happie and thrysblissed was thy estate, enioying the sweete maydenhedd of thy affection, and vse of fredome, without awe or controlement of any? where now (alas) the touche of a contrarye experience, yeldes me the effect of a thousande deathes, without lycence notwithstandynge to dye, whereby I sholde dismisse euerye plage that staieth the fattall desyer of my dyeng hart, wherein hathe fortune this cause of displeasure againste me, yf not that shée is dis∣dainefull
of the quiett whyche wee wretches fynde vppon earthe and suche an ennemye to the common contentement of vs all, that only to manifest her power amongeste vs she, vppon a soddaynes choake oure pleasant thurste and de∣syer of free lyfe wyth, pilles of passions and annoyes of more bitter taste, then any gall tempered with the moste stronge ruberbe, that euer came oute of Alaxandria, comit∣tinge vs in thende to a martirdome of more extremetie, then the pange appointed by deathe, to breake in peces the force and strengthe of the harte? whereof who is a more familiar experience, then the miserable Philiberto, who in exchaunge of his former quiett and contentement of will, hath coughte alas a captiuitie more cruell, then he that is condemned to end his dayes in the bottom of a dongeon. Ah madame, how your countenance argueth the small regarde whyche Zylia hathe of my paine? full well do I sée alas, that she neyther maks accompte of my letters, nor vseth pitie to my distresse, and muche lesse giues any creditt at all to your honest fren∣deshipp, whyche I confesse I haue greatelye abused, in pro∣curing you displeasure, for the ease of my disquiett? let loue beare the blame, and I the iuste pennance of myne owne in∣discrecion that so rashely haue entred the sea of my owne sorowe, and sawe at setting from the shoare, sufficyent ar∣gumentes of mortall euills, threatenynge my present pe∣ril, wherein albeit I was flattered at the first with a calme and pleasant ebb, whiche made my hoyse sayle and floate without anye feare, yet in the veraye inconstancy which all men attributes to that element, and vnruly waues raging without measure in the heighte of that trobled sea, appered plainelie enoughe, the likelehodes of my present daunger, whiche I woulde hadde power to destrdye me by some sod∣daine shypwrake, or caste me spedelye into the bottomles golphe to be deuowred in the throate of some monster in the merciles occean Ah Loue, with what iustice cold I exclaime againste thy infydelitie, for that thou hast alwaies flattered
me, with an assurance of that whyche now I fynde furthest from me? haste thou a pollecie to perswade a creadit in that wherein thou meanest absolute deceite, and then to trium∣phe in the thraldome of suche as beleue thy charmes? yf this bée thy order of dealinge, why bearest thou the title of a necessarye vertue, or ympartest thyne authoritie with the powers aboue? for my parte, yf there were cause of hope, or exspectacion of deliuerie, I colde in some sorte qualefye the rage of my presēt annoye, with imaginaciō of future re∣dresse, or yf the contynuance of my gréeffe argued a lykele∣hodd of contentement hereafter, the remembraunce of my felycitie to come, wolde mortefye the panges whych nowe I am forced to féele without releace of paine? but alas too what ende doo I ymagyne a composicion with hym, that is Loue not se∣uiahle to any order. not leuyable to any order, and muche lesse partaker of the nobled vertue or gifte of piti? why do I pleade for grace in a courte of comon crueltie wher tyranny shootes the gates of compassion against complaintes of iustice? or to what end sholde I expect so much as a simple offer of help in him, who is borne the common enemie & destruction of many? is there exspectacion of remedie in him, whose breath is a poisō more infectiue, then any venym that earste hath bene made by the moest conning enchauntor that euer was bred in the mye∣rye vale? or is there reason to depende vppon the delyuery of hym, who lyeth in ambushe to assalte me in worse sorte, then yet I haue felte? Ah cruell mistrys, full euill do you measure the circunstance and effect of my goodwill, with protestacion of vowe neuer to departe out of the lease of your commandementes? fewer yf your waspish mynd wold confirme and make good the consent of your beautie, or that your inwarde partes wolde giue leaue to thoutewarde ar∣guments to worke an effect of that which they promysse by showe, I sholde not haue cause to lament suche lacke in you and muche lesse indure thys extremetye by hopynge for that whyche I knowe I shall neuer haue? Oh coulde recom∣pence and vnthankefull retourne of the loyall zeale I haue
borne wythout spotte of dishonest intente in any sortt: A serpent and masqued basylyke in whome is rather a fay∣ned showe, then true effect of any curtesye, the only glaun∣ces of thyne eyes haue had power to fill euery corner of my hart full of poysoned infection, wherein at leaste if I hadd thassistance of any arte or droague to remoue thy forces, I should bée restored to myne aunciente quiet, and thow liue at rest without the noyse of so manye ymportunities. And nowe do I sée an experience of auncient opynion touchinge the maladie of loue, who is neyther healed by salue, nor cured by arte: for to make insicion to the sore, wolde giue but in∣crease to my payne, & to vse thapplicacion of medicins, wer but to féede the tyme with incertenties, and to staye the hu∣mor, were enoughe to giue ende to my lyfe, by present suff∣cacion, so that alas I sée no choice of remedie, then to bée tou¦ched wyth the hande that first gaue vent and set abroach the cause of the wound, that I wishe (in ful satisfaction of al my torment) that she might sée the verye depth and furthest part of my hart, to the nde shée might bée iudge of my loyaltie, and acknowledge the wronge she doth to the vertu of my honest meaninge. But alas, I fynde herein that my destynies con∣tende agaynst my desyer, and the viewe of her former cru∣eltie, makes me dispair of other fauor, then suche as hither∣vnto I haue founde, so that as I whollie depende vppon her goodnes, and my lyfe paiseth only in the ballance of her good will, so I know she is fully desolued in a contrarye disposi∣cion agaynst me, makinge a Iest of my humble sute and of∣fer of seruice, takes pleasure in my martirdom, and reapose a speciall felycitie in the pointes of my peculiar and mortall gréefe, whych he ended not without suche abundance of tea¦res, and supply of other sorowe, that the messenger was for∣ced to abandon the place, and leaue him in the middest of his passion, ymparting notwithstanding, the pointes of her aun¦swere to a deare frende of the knighte, wyth aduise to sup∣plante his affection, or els seke his remedie by some other meanes, wherin albeit he performed thindeuor of a frende
euerye waye, yet the successe argued a small vertue in his diligence and the patient rather resolued in extremeties, the hable to admit any thinge whiche ymported a moderacion to his gréefe, the whych gréew ymediatlie to suche extreme tearmes, that the strength and desyer of the stomake was con¦uerted ymediatlie into a contempt of necessarie sustentaci∣on, and in place of sléepe he embraced the offer of vaine con∣ceites, appearinge (as it were) by visyon thorowe the miste∣ry of hollowe dreames, refusinge conference with all men, if not, that sometyme he wolde complaine vpon the crueltie of one whom he wold not name, wyth desyer to end his life in the pursewte of that quarel. The phizicions were found at the end of their wittes, both vnhable to discerne the cause of his disease, and wythout sil to giue a remedie to his euil, what inspection soeuer they made in his vryne or tryeng of his pulses, or other signes to iudge his gréeffe or any autho∣rytye of their arte, wherevpon the gentleman his compani∣on entred into such tearmes of sorowe for the sicknes of his frende, that his dollor seamed of equall qualytie to the passi∣on of his cōpanion, not ceassing notwithstanding to solicite the goodwil of Zilya, by his own trauell, & letters, whych put her in remembrance of the pytie that women oughte to vse to thafflicted, presentes and promises of no smal price wyth other deuises wherin he iudged any vertu to moue her hag∣garde disposicion, and for that he sawe that in the very view of her presence, consisted the recouery of his frende, he for∣gat not to entreat her wt tearmes due as he had sewed to the greatest princesse of Spayne or Italye, wherein, notwyth∣standynge he gayned asmuche as if he had vndertaken to nomber the starres, or stay yt course of the sonne, for that she excused her selfe vppon her wydo wheade, and how euyll it became a gentlewoman of her estate and callynge, to comit her honor to dowte, and honest name to question, in visiting the sicknes of one who is neyther parent nor allye, nor al∣moste any waye knowen vnto her, whyche as it dryue hym frome further attempte that waye, so waighinge the distres
of his trend, & ye vertu which nature hath giuen to onewomā to entreat an other, thought it a pece of pollecie to geue a se¦cōd charge of her, who first broached his request to his cruel mistrys, to whom he preferred suche reasons as he accomp∣ted of force to perswade her, sometime alledginge the pytie which naturallie is incydent to all women, and when, and vppon whom it ought to bée exposed, hée preferred also the glory wt names of ymmortalytie which diuerse of forreine time haue won by semblable vertue, where with he won a seconde graunte of her furtherance, so farr furth as at thin∣stant they wente together to the lodginge of Seignenr Virley in whom the very view of his aunciente frende and nexte neighbour sturred vp a more encrease of sorowe, forcinge hym to a further complaint then affore with desyer chiefly, that he had neuer made exsperience of her faith nor she cause to attempte the frendshipp of her, whose crueltie in preser∣uinge her honor, is greater then is necessarye, and compassi∣on lesse then is conuenient for his distresse, proceding only of an honest zeale without intent of violacion of honor or ho∣neste name: which wyth dyuerse argumentts of ghastelye regarde, accompanienge his last wordes, wrought such ef∣fectes of pytie and remorse in the honest matrone his neigh∣bour, that to preuent his further daunger, shée gaue hym assu¦rance of her vttermost, in boarding eftsōes the goodwil of his oye mistrys with protestacion of waranty, that if he wer de¦liuered of his sicknes, she wold procure a mutual conference betwen him, and the cause of his vniust torment, wherunto albeit he gaue litle credit, for that he thought it was but a broth brued of artifyciall liccour to féed him with dropps of vncertaine consolacion, yet in the very offer of her frendship appered a hoe of spedie deliuery which she promised eftso∣nes in sort as you haue hard, willinge him to reapose him∣selfe whollie in the vertue of her indeuor and worde, which seamed to breath an ayre of such compfort and force thorow all his partes, that defyenge the malice of his late sicknes, hée seamed euen then to lacke no part of his former health,
neyther had he néede of restoretiues or force of confections to confirme his recouerye, or assistance of staffe or crooche, to supporte his feble lymmes weakned with so longe sicknes, but perswadinge a wounderfull felicyty in the very remem¦brance whiche his mistrys seamed to haue of his distresse, he ymagyned to syt alredie in the paradise of his pleasure dismissinge ymediatly the messenger, who carefull for her part to put her promisse in vse attended thoffer of cōuenient time to worke theffect accordingly, wherin she was assisted with a speciall fauor of fortune, who for the more expedicion of ye matter, brought Zylya & the lady messenger to mete wtin iij. daies after) in one pew or cloase deske in ye church, wher ye solicitor of Seigueur Virley forcing certeine teares in her eyes, begā to practise for her clyent in such sort yt what wt repeti∣cion of the passion of the knighte, speciall reproche againste the crueltie of women in those cases, with generall comē∣dacion to ye vertue of such as declare compassion vpon the dis¦tress of thafflicted, she wrought her to a remorse of his paine, with consent to preuente his further perill, wyth a sim∣ple offer of the viewe of her presence, and that vnder tearmes of condicion, that frome and after the tyme of such frendshipp he shold disclayme al ymportunities in the pursute of further fauor, wherewyth she enioyned hym on∣ly a libertie of an howers conference the next day at ij of the clocke in thafter none, where (saith shée) I haue more regard to thextremetie of his distresse wyth desyer to stop the course of further daunger in him, then to giue hym any cause at al to make his proffit of this frendeshippe or perswade a hope of further fauor in me hereafter, prayinge you for your part, to giue hym in straite charge, neyther to breake the mo∣ment of appointmente, nor excede the lymyt of his tyme, wherein as I reappose a chiefe credit in youre honestie, so if the successe aunswere not my exspectacion, assure your selfe, youre vertue cann not escape wythe oute slaun∣der, and the best parte of youre faythe remeyne in que∣stion

Ah madame (saith he) how easye yt is to de∣uise of my disease, and harde for me to hope for remedye at youre hande, that doutes of the greatnes of my passion, and easlye may he prefer either mirth or sorowe at hys pleasure whose mind is free from conceits of dout or dispayre: where theharte truelye passioned, dreades to make declaracion of eyther of theim, least in excedyng in the one, or seaminge to muche a nigard of the other. the showe of eyther of theim bringe his sute or honest intent in Ilewse suspicion with theym, in whom onely resteth the Cataplama of his sore, so that I accompte hym now the most infortunat man, whose state is vnhapelye broughte vnder the awe of suche two mortal extremeties: and for my parte, yf I were as frée from thextreame pointes of affection, as you seame farre from reason to doute of the greatnes of my gréeff, I coulde (with better will) allowe your discreditt in the faythe and inconstancye of menne: but alas hee that is caughte with the snares of true loue, canne beholde no other figure, nor make other liknes thenne of the true cause of hys affection, the picture whereof remeyneth for euer within the sewrest part of the hart, whiche in deede (as you saye is the true mirroer, wherein appereth not a fayned shadowe, fadyng with the forme, but a contynuall viewe and remē∣brance of her, by whome wée lyue in suche heauenly con∣templaciō

And touching thargumentes of healthe whiche you note in me, I am to yeld you alone all homage and honour for the same, for that the fauor whiche I fynde in thys present appointement and conference with you, hathe sturred vpp thys glee of good lykyng thorow all my partes, with more contentement of the happy encounter, thē my former gréeues gaue me cause of extreme dystresse, and yet my martirdome hath ney∣ther bene so small nor secrett, but the whole worlde hathe witnessed my panges, and you also myghte haue beleued theyme, yf eyther the sorowe of my selfe, or reapport of such as tooke pitie of me, had bene of creditt with you, whereof also I am yet to endure a more harde share (yf yt maye bee ymagyned by any braine) so that the same were hable to force a remorse in you on my behalfe, for the greatest felicity I haue in this worlde is, to haue the fauor of any cōmaun∣dement at youre hande (what perill soeuer yt ymportte) to thende my diligence and readie indeuor to do you seruice therein or other your affaires what so euer, maye iustefye the vowe of my vnfained hacte towardes you, like as also I perswade my selfe to bee reysed from a hundreth thousande deathes together, when I ymagyn but a simple compassion in you touchynge the torment I suffer for youre beautie, wherein yf euer I hadde reason to take pleasure, by a de∣lite whyche nature hathe wroughte in the thynge, I am sewer alredie to haue hadd my parte of a thousande annoies, by the regards of crueltie I haue found in you, el at last good ladie, the comission of former torments, & ceasse hens∣furth to plage him that is readye in the place to comitt hys
bodie to any sacrafy ce for the ransome of your fauour, what moueth you alas to a discreditt or doute of my payne, wyth opynion that my passion is dyssembled? lett the sondrye sortes of teares heretofore distilled on the behalfe of youre discurtesye, so many dayes broughte to end with continuall sorow, and nyghtes drawen out at lengthe with drayninge sighes, ye the present viewe of my pale and ghastelye, ghost perswade you of the contrarye, with assurance of my vn∣dowted loyaltie for euer? wherewith he behelde her, not without a vente of soddayne teares trycklynge alonge hys cheekes, and shee for her parte regarded the earthe wyth a face full of dysdaine, (as yt seamed) whyche notwithstan∣dynge he construed to a proffitt of hys sute pursewynge the same eftesones in this sorte. Ah madame haue you the hart to deface the glorie of that deuyne beautie of yours wyth an acte of more TYRRANNIE then euer hath bene noted in anye woman of former tyme? or accompte you yt a ver∣tue to kyll hym, who dyethe euerye hower in the ve∣ray viewe and remembrance of the heauenlye perfection, wherein you only excell al that euer haue bene called faire? if you resolued haue my ruyne, why stay you to do executiō, abridge godd Ladye my lingringe torment, with a presente dispatche and ende of lyfe, deferr no longer the fatall mini∣sters of your wyl, seynge you are aggreed to performe the effect, and suffer at laste my waterye eyes to stop the strea∣mes of their auncient sorowe, deryued of the onelye viewe and remembrance of the mystrys of their contemplacions, whereby my harte shall also supp the laste Syropp of despe∣rate hope, and my affections vanyshe with the dekaye of my bodye, who is heare readie to become your fattall har∣benger in the other worlde, with hope to reape there the hyer of my present merytt. The Ladye, whether her anger woulde gyue no longer place to hys complaint, or that she dowted a force or charme in the same to ouerthrow the fortresse of her chastetie, gaue him the looke of a waspishe mynd, reprehending his rashnes
with theis or suche like tearmes of reproche. Yf my pacience woulde yet giue leaue to your fonde dis∣course, Zilya repre hendeth her vvoer. I see no wante of desyer in you to attempte me with requestes, which neither is your parte to preferr to one of my condicion and callynge, nor yet my honor can brooke, to heare of the mouth of suche as soeke but to seduce the hone∣stie of chaste Ladies, wherein as you haue exacted vpon the frendshipp and facilitye in me to here the vttermost of your sute, presumyng (belike) of my consent to depart wyth that whiche you can not restore me againe, So, besides that the present experience of your foule intent, shall serue me here∣after as a warraunte againste the assaultes of suche offers eyther in your selfe, or any other equal to you in disposictō, I can giue no other aunswere to the tearmes of your re∣queste, nor fauor to your fowle attempte, but that from the instant, you ceasse to solicite me eyther by your selfe, or any embassador on your behalfe, protestynge vnto you (for my part) neyther to be séene in the stréete, nor other place of pu∣blike beinge, so longe as you are in the countreye, and muche lesse suffer thaccesse of anye Gentleman within my house, onles he bée my neare parent or allye, by whiche meanes your importunities onely shall punishe me wyth a sorowful restrainte and absence from the societie of my olde companions and frendes: whiche laste resolucion seamed suche a mistery to the mynde of thinfortunat Virley, that for the time, he stoode as enchaunted or one newlye drop∣ped fourth of the cloudes, till at laste as one whollie con∣uerted into dispaire of further fauor at her hande, he craued onelye, for consideracion of his paynes paste, and laste fare∣well of his loyall fayth to her, a kysse, which he sayed sholde satisfye his longynge at full, and discharge her of further pursewete accordynge to her requeste. The malicious Ladye notinge the fonde desyer of the knighte, and wyth what small coste she mighte nowe rydd her of an importuante suter, meanynge notwythstandyng
to departe with so small a fauor, but for a price of greate pennance to hym that soughte to buy it, tolde hym, that as∣well to satisfye his present request, as also to make a fur∣ther prooffe of his faith, she wolde performe the full of hys last demaunde, yf he wolde giue her assurance by the sayth of a gentleman, to do one thinge wherein she was to re∣quire hym, whiche the simple Vyrley did not onely promisse by all protestations of religion or othe, but pawned also the maiestie of the highest for performyng euery such comman∣dement as it pleased her to enioyne hym, wherewith she sea∣med satisfyed touchyng thassurance of his consent, and ther∣vpon entred into theffect of her owne promisse, embracinge and kissynge hym as yf it had bene the firste nighte of theyr mariage, requiryng hym in like sorte to become the maister of his worde and aduouche the pointes of his late graunte. The pore gentleman suspectynge no one thoughte of suche tyrannye in his mistrys, and muche lesse that he shoulde buye his kisses at so deare a price, tolde her he attended the only sommonee of her cōmaundement, to thende she mighte witnes his readye indeuor to obeye her: she enioyned hym that from that hower till iij. yeres were expired, he shoulde become muett, without speakynge in any sorte to any crea∣ture lyuing, how great so euer his occasion appeared, in the true obseruynge whereof (saith she) shall appeare an expe∣rience of your faith, whiche also maye force hereafter a fur∣ther benefit for you, where the contrarie wil not only disco∣uer your villānte, but be readye to accuse you of periurie on the behalfe of a Gentlewoman. He thinkes I see the per∣plexed countenaunce of the pore knighte, who hearinge the sentence of his hard pennaunce, iudged as greate iniustice in her, for taxing him at so cruell a rate, as difficultie in him selfe to performe theffect of so strāge a charge: albeit his hart was so greate, and he so papisticall in performynge hys vowe, that he began euen then to enter into the pointes of her commaundement, declarynge by signes that she should
bée obeyed, wherewith he gaue her an humble reuerence and retyred immediatly to hys lodgynge, faygnynge to suche as were aboute hym, that the extremetie of a colde rhume distillynge from the partes of the braine had taken awaye the vse of his tounge. And because his domnes shoulde not bee a gréeffe to his frendes, nor they moue his disquiett in demaundynge the cause, he determyned to bée a straunger to his countrey till the yeares of pennaunce were runne oute, wherewith committynge the order of his affayres at Mountcall or els where in Pyemount to the creditt of suche as he thought méete to supplye the place of suche truste, tooke twoo or thrée of his familyar compa∣nions to assiste his voyage, whiche he directed rightelye into fraunce as a countreye moste méete for hys abode, chiefly for the mortall warres as then betwen CHARLES the seuenth, and the valyaunt Englishe men possessynge his countrey, in the yeare 1451. And as the Kynge was then in campp in Gascoyne, with in∣tent to pursewe the goodnes of his fortune, and delyuer his contrey altogether from thenglishe nacion, he addres∣sed hymselfe and force to the Duchye of Normandye, where this Pyemountaine knight, being in the campp, was knowen by and by to diuerse of the chiefstaines aboute the kynge, aswell by the notable seruice they had seene hym do in diuerse places, as also greate creditt he hathe had afore wyth thearle of Pyemount, who after became Duke of Scauoye, where was greate repaire of the nobilitye of Fraunce, for that he maryed Madame Iolante seconde doughter to CHARLES the seuenth: after they hadde a whyle lamented his lacke of speache (not knowynge for all they coulde doo the cause of suche disease) they pre∣sented hym afore the Maiestye wyth suche commenda∣cyon of hys vertue and valyauntnes in armes as was necessarye for the worthynes of the same, whyche for∣ced a greate lykynge in the Kynge towardes hym, al∣albeit
his outwarde apparaunce argued infficiently his in∣warde dexteritie that way, whych also he confyrmed in pub licke view in an assalte which the kinge gaue to the english men within Roan, the chiefe and only bool warke of the whole country of Normandy, where Signeur Philibarto gaue suche ef∣fecces 1451. of his forwardnes, that he was the first that was séene vpon the walles making waye to the souldiours to enter the breache and towne, wherein not longe affore the Duke of Sommerset had burned the counterfait prophet of Fraunce 143. called La Pucelle leane, whome some pratinge frenchmen do affirme to haue wrought merueiles in armes during those warrs, but chiefly that vnder the conduite of her, our coun∣tryemen lost Orleance wc diuerse other holdes in those partes, and for a memory of that forged ydoll they kepe yet amon∣gest other relikes in the abbay of. S. Denys,, whych I sawe in May last, a great roostie sworde, wherwith they are not asha∣med to aduowche that shee performed diuerse expedicions and victories againste thinglishe nacion, whych seames as true, as that which they are a shamed to put in a chronicle of credit touching their saint Denys, whom they affirme was erecuted at Parys, and came from thence with his heade in Written in their boke of  cal∣led caalo∣gue des mart∣uis. his hand, which he buyried in the abbaye, albeit they saye he rested foure tymes by the way where they haue founded iiii. crosses with the headles ymage of saint Denys holding a sto∣nye skalpe in his hande, but nowe to oure Dom Philiberto, whose forwardnes and fortune in the last assalte, being wel noted of the kinge, began to kindle a credit in the mynde of the maiestie towards hym in such sorte, as besydes speciall praises giuen to his worthynes in the hearing of all his cap∣teines, he presented hym wyth the state of a gentleman of his chamber, with pension sufficient to menteyne the port of that place, promisinge besydes an encrease of his bowntye, as he saw a contynuance of hys good seruice, for the whyche the mute knighte gaue the kynge humble thankes, by signes lyfting hys handes towards heauen as a witnes of ye
faithe, he promised to kepe without spot to hys prince, wher of he gaue good declaracion not long after in a skirmishe, procured by the frenche agaynst the Englishe soldiours, vn∣der the guide of the onlye flower of chyualrye of that tyme, and valyant Captcine the Lorde Talbot, whose vertue made hym so famons in those warrs, that the verye remembrance of hys name procureth a terror to the stowtest frencheman that thys daye lyueth ther, in this skirmish (if a mā may cre∣dit a french bragge) the Pyemontoyse and Talbot met, and vn∣horssed eche other, wherupon the kynge in consideracion of hys present seruice and encrease of further corage to conty∣nue his souldiour, made hym Capteyne of diuerse holdes, with charge of fyftie men at armes, wyth promisse (in the word of a prince) yt her eafter he shold find in more ample ma ner, in what sorte princes oughte to consider the seruice of suche whose vertue broughte soccours to the necessitie of hym and his people, wherein truely a prince hath greate reason not only to bestowe rewardes vpon such as deserue well, but embrase that whyche carieth a licknes of hys owne nobylitie, seinge that vertue, in what place soeuer shee take roote, can not but bring furthe good frutes, the vse and effect wherof, ought to appeare vpon such as approche or resem∣ble the place, where the first séedes were sowen, neyther doth any degrée of men (according to thopinion of Plyny) deserue so well of hys prince, as the souldiour, in whose woundes (sayth he) are inclosed the sauetie of the whole countrey, and quiet of the seat royal, neyther doth he shrinke to aduenture hys bodye agaynst thennemye, to establish the reapose of his neyghbour at hoame who to requite his many daungers in ye felde, or releue hys maymed lymmes, cōsumed wc ye warrs, comittes hym at hys retorne to the rigour of iustice and that most cōmonly wythout cause of iust offence, wherof I think no one contry of christendom, is hable to furnish so many ex∣amples of that miserie, as the state of Englande, where as (god be praysed hath benn no greate occasion of warr, since the happie raigne of oure moste blessed Quene that nowe
gouerneth) so (the Lorde, and her maiestie amend it) it is a pitye to sée how slenderly soldiours be prouided for, and how tyranouslye they are persecuted by the malice of caterpillors in Cyties, and franklinges in the countrye, wherof I wishe some suche as I coulde name to mooster in the mowthe of a trenche, or stande in the face of a breache, to thende they might both witnes the daunger, and be partakers of the pe∣rill of warr, which I doubt not wolde force in the moste of theim a compassion, touching the souldiour, whom also they wolde defende from beinge deuowred of the gallowes, by their malice. Thus muche on the behalfe of souldiours, to∣wardes whom I wishe as indiffrent a care in tyme of peace as they are readie and most sewer to abide al daunger when it pleaseth the prince and realme to call theym to seruice, and now to oure dome knighte, who embrased of the kyng, wyth honor of all his Capteines, was assisted with a second meane of further credit with hys prince, for that ymedyat∣lie after the heate of the warrs in fraunce and the countrey resolued to a quiet staie, it pleased the kinge, for the solace of hymselfe, and generall contentinente of hys Capteynes to call a torney royall on horsebacke, where Seigneur Virley enioyeng ye benefyt of his former fortune, wan only ye glorye of ye tryumphe, which gaue such encrease to ye good opiniō of the king, yt he entred into councell to cure his dome disease greuinge not a litle that so valyant a gentleman colde not declare his deuise, whych seamed to argue no lesse wisedom, for the direction of a cōmon welthe or contrey, then the force and agilitye of his body had sufficientlie approued his vertue in diuerse exploites during tha war: wherfore he dispatched generall letters thorowout his owne Realme, with speciall requestes to the countreys adioyninge hys kingdome, that who colde giue remedye to his euill, and conuert his present scilence, into a liberty of frée speche, should haue ten thow∣sande frankes for rewarde: then mighte a man sée suche a mooster of phizisions, & Chirurgions with their appoticaries carienge their bagges and boxes of all confections, that their
rowte seamed rather a newe supplie of power to assiste the kinge against his ennemies, then a conuocation of gownes∣men to consulte of the disease, who began also to make such war with the ten thousande frankes, skirmishinge one with an other, not so muche for the glorye of the acte, as gaine of the moneye, (without anye helpe notwithstandinge to the sickman) that the kinge was dryuen to adde to his golden offer, an expresse condicion, that who soeuer vndertoke the cure, wythoute performynge the effecte within a cer∣teine time, shoulde make good the saied sume to the com∣modytie of the kinge, or for want of paymente to leaue his head in pawne, whiche proclaimed ymediatlye a generall re∣tire to Monseur le Medecyn, wyth the rest of his mistical crwe & wypinge his nose with the insyde of his sleue, detested with ympietie, both Galleine, Hypocrates, and Auiecenes, with o∣ther patrons and auncient fathers of phisicke, that wolde not leaue theim a sufficient net to fysh so great an honor and riches as ten thousand frankes: the brute was no soner made then thofficers of fame vndertooke to disperse it into euery corner of the countreye, wt participacion of the royall edicts and liberalitie of the king to euery prouince as well on this∣syde as beyonde the mountes, wberuppon Montcall became pertaker of the newes and Zylya (the firste and onlye cause of al) was pryuie (by this meanes) to the place of aboade of her penytenciall louer, and also perswaded of his loyaltie in keping his promise vnworthy any way of such firme regard: seinge that wher fraude and force do occupie the hart, the re∣ligion of promises, yea the very bond of faith already giuen, do loase their force, neyther is a man bownde to performe yt, wherin is cōstraint of bond: The couetous widow, assuring her self of no lesse authoritie ouer Seigneur Virley thē when he made court to her at Montcal, determyned to go visit him at Parys, not so much of intent to vndo the charme of his dome disease, as desierous of the ten thousand frākes, whereof she made as sure accompte, as if they were alreadye vnder the sewereste locke in her closset at MONTCALL,
perswadyng her selfe also, that the gentleman (being absol∣ued of his promiss by her) would gladly consent, and that she only should haue the rewarde and fame of the thinge, wher∣in all others were hable to worke no effect. Here you sée a woman, whom neyther the vertue of honest and true loue, nor intent of vnfained and loyall seruice, colde earste moue to compassion, and muche lesse aggrée to giue ease to the sinister affliction of her seruant, wrested to a remorse, and ouercome with a desyer of fylthie gaine, to enlarge her richesse. Oh execrable thurste and desyer of mo∣ney, vntyll when endureth thy authoritye ouer the worlde, or howe longe wilte thou blynde the myndes of men, with a foggie myste of fylthie lucre? Ah insatiable, and perillous golphe, howe manye haste thou deuoured and drowned in thy bottomles throate, whose glorye had pearsed the heighte of the cloudes, & vertue shyned more cleare, then the bright∣nes of the son, yf the darke vaile or shadowe of thy conta∣giouse infection, had not eclipsed their renowme that waye? the frutes alas whiche thou bringēst furth, (what sugred showe so euer they gyue outwardely) yeldes in déede ney∣ther honest fame, nor true felicitye to such as reape theim: Seinge that, that dropseye and infectyng humour whiche ouerronneth all their partes, makes them more desyerous of the thing, then hable to bée satisfyed, whereby groweth a double discommoditie to the euill of that, whiche is thonly The desier of vnhoete gaine, the fountaine of all euills. fountayne of all mischiefe, neyther is any state more mise∣rable, then to haue a desyer to haue muche, and gettinge al, can not bée satisfyed wyth any thinge, and in the ende, ouer∣throwen in their couetous trauell by infamouus deathe, whereof I am content to omitt the familiar prooffes of our tyme, and presente you wyth the authoritye of the riche Crassus fell into the han∣des of  Crassus in Rome, to whome was awarded the punishment of God, by fallynge into the handes of the Parthens, for vio∣lacion and commyttynge sacriledge within the temple in Ierusalem: sexti mulus fryinge in like sorte in the flame of money, and whollie infected wyth the poyson of hym that
formentes the hart of the couetous, cutt of the head of hys patrone and only defendor Caius Gracchus trybune of the peo∣ple. Wherin touching lyke examples in the femenine secte, I will nowe passe ouer both forrein and familiar recordes, and restore to your memory thabuse of this Zilya, who for∣getting her former regarde to vertue, (the onely ornament of her honestye and reputacion) feared not also the toyle and trauell of the waye, nor other inconuenience what so euer, to committ her lyfe to daunger, and honor to the mer∣cy of hym, in whom the remembrance of her former wrong, sturred vpp a desyer of double reuenge, vppon the leaste occasion he coulde fynde, neyther doubted she to hazarde the effect of her buysynes in a straunge region vnknowen to al men, sauyng to hym, for the only honor of whome the mi∣sterye was wrought, but vsynge a shorte consideracion for the order of her affaires at Montcall, she strippes the moun∣tes, and by extreame labor, arryued at last at Parys, at suche time as euery man dispaired most of recouerye of the dome knighte, albeit, enquiringe for theim that had authoritye to admitte such as vndertoke the cure, she made it be published that God had putt the remedye of his disease into her hande, and that only she, doubted not to performe thexspectation of the kinge that waye: the Commissaries layde afore her the edict, with the condicion of death in the ende, if the knighte were not made to speake within xv. dayes, all whiche she ad∣mitted, & pawned her lyfe for the performance of the enter∣prise, with protestation eftesones that god had opened vnto her a secrett meane to restore hym, whereof the knighte was furthwith aduertised, merueilynge notwithstandynge what straunge gentlewoman yt was that had vndertaken to vndoo the charme of his disease, and force hym to breake the vowe of his pennance to his cruell ZYLIA, in whom (of all other) he accompted not so muche frendshipp, as to make so longe a iorney for the ease of the euill, whereof she onely was the cause, he was rather of opinion that it was hys neyghbour of Montcall, she I meane, that fyrste solicited
Zylya, on his behalfe, and now had forced her to a compassion of his pennance, wyth commission to absolue hym of the rest of his hard vow, wherof as he deuised diuersly without stay∣inge vpon any certaintie or trothe, beholde the deputies pre∣sentes Zilya, in the chamber of Seigneur Virley, who seinge an effect of that, which earst he was not hable to ymagyne, gaue iudgemente by and by, of the cause of the comminge of hys ennemye, and that the promisse of ten thousande frankes had more power to make her passe the mountes, then the res¦pect of frendship, or compassiō to his straung distresse, which so long had kept him in the likenes of a dead man, wherwt, the viewe of her former incyuilitie, and rigour exceding the disposicion of any woman that euer was noted cruel, procu∣red lymedyatlye, a conuersacion of his auncient loue andre garde to her bewtie, into a mortal hate, wyth desyer of ven∣gance equall to her offence, thinkinge it no grudge in con∣science (in accepting the offer of his fortune) to yelde detesta¦ble homage in déede to the saint, that earst accompted al his seruice but effectes of ydolatry, and to retorne her frendship with a trybute of the same money, wyth the whiche she made hym tast the frutes of an inordinate crueltie, aswell for hys owne contentmente in acquitinge so good atorne with sem∣blable payment, as also to leaue example to all coye and dis∣daynefull dames to shonne the like abuse towardes any ho∣nest gentleman, and that, hauinge regarde to the merite of the personnes and specially to the reputaciō of themselues, they become not so prodigal as to make a vent at a vile price of their honor, whych they ought to defende, and kepe with∣out spott, agaynst the assaltes of the moste honest and vertu∣ous louer that euer offred to serue vnder the flagge of any bewtie, how cleare so euer it shoane, and yet howe manye of those do wee sée now a dayes, who wyll not sticke to denye the seruice of suche as proffer theim loue aswell for the res∣pecte of vertue, as desyer to embrase a fadinge glée of flicke∣ringe bewtie, and after commit theimselues to open sale, to
who will bidd most for theim, whyche kinde of Venitian Ma∣donas, as I wishe to be barred the societie of chaste ladyes, and not suffred to sytt amongest the most errande coortisans yt euer were, hauing any sparke of zeale or frendship in their harte, so they had but iustice (in myne opynion) if the bene∣fyt or libertie of euerye common wealth were taken frome theime to thende they might wander as a kinde of marked people of all the worlde: for she that loueth for money and makes a gaine or certeine reuenue of thuse of her bodie, wil seldome make conscience to betraye hym to whom she giues contenance of frendship, seinge her loue (typped with a di∣syer of gaine, tendes altogether to endes of euill, and actes of tyrannoyse effect, wherein as the honest sorte of women are alwayes defended by thintegretye of their conuersacion and life, so I craue a patience in the rest, touchinge the pu∣nishment I wishe vpon theim, and spedie amendment of lif, to thende their vertue may make theym as meritorious of reputacion in déede, as some of theime are vndowtedlye vnworthye of the vse of lyfe, or benefytte of common ayre. Seigneur Virley then hauinge Zylya in his presence, and al∣most at commaundement, fayned not to knowe her, refrai∣ninge from all offers of humanitye eyther, by salutinge her comminge by signes of thankefull countenance or other wayes, whych at the first moued no small astonishmente in our wydow, who, notwithstanding seing she was entred in to an enterprise, theffect wherof (she sawe) cold not bée perfor∣med without the losse of honor or life, made of necessetie a vertue, wyth resolucion to commtt her to the mercie of her fortune, and make a laste prooffe of her goodnes, what inconstauncye soo euer is gyuen vnto her of all men, wherewyth desyeringe the reste to retire, shee shoot the doare, and toke the knighte by the hande, whome shee behelde in the face, and with a smylinge regarde, asked hym, if he had so sone forgotten hys deare ZYLYA, or
if he had the hart to make so smal accōpte of her in that place yeldinge her not long since such authoritye ouer hym and al that was his at Montcall? dissemble no more (sayth she) to knowe her, who hath stayed for no paines to comme hether to acquite you of your promiss, with requeste to pardon the faulte I haue made in abusynge the vertue of thoneste loue you bare me, it is I, who lamentyng my former crueltye, am here to do pennaunce for the wronge I haue don you, in restraining the libertie of your tonge, and takynge reuenge of my former rigour, am to yelde tribut to your rare loyal∣tye, with more redines to dismisse the charme that so longe hath kepte your tonge enchanted, then euer I had reason to add so cruell a recompence, to your honeste deserte. All whiche seamed to moue as manye wordes in the dome knighte, as there is lyfe or féeling in the senceles rocke stan∣ding in the middest of the sea, and seinge him make signes, that it was not in his power to speake, nor to remoue then∣chauntement of his tounge, she was forced to recharge him with all sortes of kisses, embracing & collyng euery part of his face and necke, not without great store of teares, wher∣with she bedewed eche parte of his bossom and outwarde garmentes, vsing thassistance of euerye meane wherein she iudged vertue to make hym tractable to her request, whych notwithstādyng he retourned wyth a solemne scilence, and forgettyng his auncient ceremonies, and amarous oraciōs, whiche he was wonte to vse, as perswacions of pitye to his Ladye, he alledged nowe a dispense from speakynge by her commandement only, practising altogether (by signes) the vse and execution of that, which earste he had so hoatly pur∣sewed, both by sute and longe seruice, wherin as he seamed somwhat awaked by her, that long had kepte his mynde in a somber, and drayned his bodye both of desyer and corage, so he soughte in like sorte to sett abroache in her, an appetitt of that wherein she hath bene earste, no lesse curious then straung, wherin she, for her part, (more to preuent the peril of lyfe, & losse of the peinall condicion, then for any respecte
of frendshipp to the knightes,) made hym the maister of his requeste, with consent to vse her at his pleasure & franke possession of that, which he & all louers accompte the chiefest felicitie in loue, wherin they liued with equal contentement vntil the ende of xv dayes (the tearme appointed to cure the knighte) without that the pore wydowe coulde make con∣uersion of her dome patient, into a man vsing the libertie of his speche, albeit she layed afore him, in how many sortes she greued with her owne follie, in binding him to so strāge inconuenience, & the pennance she had don losing her honor, to satisfie his pleasure, & absolue him of his vowe: all which seamed as Hebrue songes to Seigneur Virley, who determi∣nynge to playe double or quitt with her, thoughte it ne∣cessarie to add a further feare to her former losse, to thende, she mighte féele her parte of daunger, aswell as her crueltye had made hym pyne awaye in secret sorowe the better parte of two yeres: which he performed accordingly, for, ye tearme expired, and the knighte nothing altered from his auncient order of scilent disposicion, the cōmissioners sommoned the Lady wydowe to performe the pointes of thedict, importing ij. choises of perentorie extremitie, either to paye ten thou∣sand frankes whiche she had not, nor was hable to gett, or make good her promisse with the losse of her lyfe, which she was sewer to performe, without a speciall grace of the king, and that by thintercession of her enemye. What was now the refuge of this Ladie, distressed on euery side, if not to retire into teares, dropping with streames of present sorow, in the remembrāce of her former crueltie▪ ah Zylpa soro∣vveth her for mer crueltie. vnhappye and thryswretched Ladye that I am (saith she) broughte to due desolacion and punishment by shame for an effecte of crueltie excedinge the barbarous disposicion of the Lurke or Moare, or other infidell withoute religion or faith: in séekinge alas to deceiue an other, I am fallen into the daunger appointed to giue ende to my lyfe? Was it not sufficient for me to be warned of the reuenge of mine ene∣mye, by myne owne rigour vsed towardes hym, but that I
muste attempte his curtesie, and willinglie fal into the ma∣lice of hym, who, triumphinge in the spoiles of mine honor, gothe about also to take from me my lyfe, & mortifye my re∣nowme Honestie the chiefest sup∣port of lyfe. for euer? Why fel I not alas into the Iawes of som wilde beaste in passing the alpes, or threw my selfe hedlong from the topp of some craggie mountaine, whereby I shold haue preuented the stroake of his malice, who séekes to make me a wounder to the multitude, for attemptinge a thinge, which restes whollie at the wil and pleasure of him, whom I had so haynously offended. Ah Seigneur Virley, howe can you bestowe suche colde consideracion, on the pleasures wherein I haue bene so liberall on youre behalfe? or what moueth these regardes of disdaine, with desyer to haue the lyfe of her, who if euer she offended, hath alredie performed the pennaunce of her falte? and what offence is so greate, whiche is not satisfyed, with amendes for the trespas? which if I haue not alreadye aunswered, let my teares make good the reste of your rigorous sentence? Imagin Seigneur Virley. What a vertue it is to forgiue, where the extremetye of re∣uenge is the fowlest vice that occupieth the harte of man. And for your parte, as you haue made your selfe knowen to the worlde, by your continuall felicitie in all your affaires, so sticke not to make an encrease of your glorye by preuen∣tynge the perill of her, who lyinge prostrate afore your knées, bathinge the same in the sooddes of her sorowfull tea∣res, dothe also kysse your feet, in signe of repentance of her former follye? Ah lett me not dye for my simplicitye, nor min honor put to sacrifise, as a reuenge of the litle wronge, whiche I confesse my chastetie hath don you: take not alas so cruell vengeance vppon so small an offence, neyther suf∣fer the blodd of my life to quenche the thurst of your malice, that haue alredie payed treble tribute, in respect of my falte, wherewith (meanynge yet to continue in tearmes of com∣plaint) the sergeaunt Cryminall (wyth authoritie from the Kyng) arested her to prison, whether she wente with small constraint, as wearye alredye with the view of her present
miserye and loathynge the vse of longer lyfe, hauynge loste the chiefe support of the same. But the knighte pinched with some remorse touchinge the passion of his deare Zilya, thinkynge her sufficiently punished for so small offence, wente immediatly to the kynge, to whome, in the hearing of his Lordes, he makes discourse of his loue passed, the cru∣eltie of Zilya in bindynge hym to a vowe of scilence for iij. yeres, and the present reuenge he hath taken of her discur∣tesye, wyth humble request in the ende, to moderat the ri∣gour of his iustice, both to her, and others that were in pri∣son for his recouerye, seing (saith he) the same depended ei∣ther vppon her that bounde me to that charge, or els vppon thassistance of time, which at last woulde haue dissolued my dome fraunce, by thaccomplishment of the thinge whiche my fayth bounde me to performe. The kynge merueiled not alitle to heare so straunge a hi∣storye, reioysyng notwithstandynge in the happie retourne of his speche, and giuing singler commendacion to the loyal∣tye of his knighte, condemned presentlye the crueltie and couetousnes of the widowe, vppon whome hadd folowed execution accordinglye, yf it had not béene preuented by the speciall intercession of Seigneur Virley, who takynge her out of prison, accompanied her certeine dayes iour∣ney, aswell to showe her the kynges liberalitye in di∣uerse townes and holdes, whiche he had bestowed vppon hym, as also to satisfye his appetitt at the full, with the frutes, whereof he had fealte earste so pleasant a taste: wherewith also she dyd not muche mislike, for that the prooff of suche fauor vnlooked for, tooke awaye the payne of her late imprisonement iustelye deserued, besides, her late dispair of life, made her doble thankeful to the author of her libertie, which she embrased with more cōtentemēt, then when she knewe not what it was to loase the pleasant taste of frée lyfe, wherein maye be noted an experience of the dea∣ling of fortune, who kepes in stoare, like punishment for all
suche, as, reaposyng to much for them selues in their owne force, do defye that litle which they accompte to consiste in others, and in respect of their owne power, do condemne the authoritye which other men haue: if a vaine glorye and con∣ceite of a chastetye inuincible, had not deceiued this Ladye, or a desyer of couetous gaine blaired her eyes, it had bene harde to haue iudged her incontinencie, whiche appeared, both in her franke familiaritie towards ye passioned knight, and also in gredie desyer to fyll her pursse, & carye awaye the praise from all other that vndertooke thenterprise, and yet as you sée, her gaine hath giuen a dishonest title to her name for euer with an occasion to thenemies of women to crie out of the whole secte, but there is no reason that the falte or fol∣lye of one, shoulde impaire in anye sorte the nobilitie of so manye vertues and honest Ladyes, whose chastetie and ho∣nest conueigh of life, defendes them againste the crueltie and couetousnes of this ZYLIA, and suche as resemble her in any sorte, who after certeine dayes of recreation with her louer retireth into Pyemount, where she drewe furth the re∣meinder of her yeres in continuall grudge and frett of con∣science, with firme perswacion euer after, that the force of man is nothinge, where God doth not worke by his grace, without whose assistance we can neyther learne that which is good, nor defende our selues from the daunger of any euil, like as also, if we want that guide in our doing, our workes (smellynge of nothinge but the corrupcion of our owne na∣ture) make vs seame not muche vnlike the loathsom swine, wallowinge in a dortye or moddie poodle, to encrease her fylthynes, FINIS.
The argument A According to the lattyne adage, e∣uerie vice, how perilous soeuer it ap¦peare, hath power to work in some degre, thopperacion of a special ver∣tu, for albeit the sondrie enormities growing daily amongest vs, by the vnbridled humor of oure affection, which we commonly cal loue argue the same to bee a passion of moste daungerous and per∣uerse corrupcion: yet we haue experience of wonderfull ef∣fectes of vertuous modestie wrought by that common e∣uill, as the whoremonger and adulteror reduced to a re∣pentance and moderacion in his pleasures, the tyran and Vertues in loue. morderor moued to compassion touching the cause of thin nocent, and the vnthrift reclaymed to an honest staie of lif, whiche makes me of opynion, that this passion (giuen vs by nature) albeit it be an infection of it selfe, yet it serues also as a contrepoison to driue out another venym, accor∣ding to the propertie of the Scorpion, which of her selfe, and in herself, carieth the sting of mortal hurte, and oynt∣mēt of spedie remedie, thoccasiō of presēt death, and meane to preserue life: not meaning for all this to perswade, that it is of necessitie, we make our selues subiect altogether to this humor of good and euill disposiciō, nor allow them that willingly incurr the perill of such fre ymprisonment, but placinge it for this tyme, amongest thinges of indiffe∣rent tolleracion, because he neither seamed blind nor void of discreciō, on the behalf of those, whose erāples I meane to prefarr in this historie. I maye boldlie aduoche that which we call affection to be a passion, resembling in som respect, the condicion of true amytie, and yet not muche
vnlike for the moste parte, the generall euill whiche the Grecians al Philautia and we tearme by the title of loue, or vaine flatterie of our selues, chiefly when we see any so frently to his desiers, that to satisfye the inordinat thruste or glot of his gredie appetit, he forgettes hothe honor and honestie, with the respect and duetie of his conscience, be∣sides what ymages of vertue, curtesie, or bowntiful dispo∣cision soeuer, our louers do ymagyn in theim, whom they serue, dymming the eyes of the worlde wyth a miste of dis∣sembled substance, as thoughe the cause of their liberall offer of seruice, were deriued of an intent of honest frend∣shippe, yet their trauailes that way concludes (we se) with other end; for that, they hunt only the chase of pleasure, pro¦cedinge of the viewe of an exterior bewtie, wherin their meaninge is sufficiently manifeste in the sugred oracions & discourses of eloquent stile, which those amarus orators seme to prefer, when their mindes (occupied whollie in the contemplacion of their mistresses, do commit the praise of the perfection in their Ladies, to the filed fordge of their fine tongue, in which, what other thing do they more chief¦ly commend, then a deuyn misterie or conninge worke of nature painted with a dy of white or redd in her face: A de¦licate tongue to dilate of matters of fancie, an entysinge countenance, with a grace and behauiour equal with the maiestie of a princes, al which as they argewe the vanitie of him that reapose delite in such fondnes, differinge alto∣gether from the true ornamentes of the soule, or pattorne wherby the perfectiō of vertue is discerned by thunfayned workes and absolute accion, So dismissing this fond phi∣losophie, not cōtending greatly whether loue be a natural corrupcion, or a thing perticipating with vertue, we may
be bold to aduouche his power to preauile in things which seame of ympossibilitie to thother passions that be com∣mon vnto vs, for what thinge can be of greater force in a man, then that, which constrainynge an alteracion of cus∣tome, and breach of that which by contynuance hath taken rote within vs, doth make (as it were) A new body, and the mynd a meare straunger to her former cogitacions, which I neither inferr without cause, nor menteyne this argu∣ment without great reasō, for that as of al the vices which spot the lif of mā, ther is none (except ye excecrable syn of whoredom) which makes vs soner forget god & good order then the detestable exercise of vnlawful game, neither are we so hardly reclaymed frō any thing, as that cutthrote de¦lite, for that it is almost as possible to conuert the crueltie of a she wolffe or lyones into a present mekenes, as to mor¦tefie the desier of plaie in him, which hath bene norrished and nozelled therin frō the beginning of his yeres: Euen so notwithstanding the force of loue, wrought such a mis∣terie in an vnthrist of Naples, that of the mo ste prodigall and ryotous spendor that hath bene noted in any age, hee made a most staide and sparing gentlemā that Italy hath brought furth of many yeres, since or afore his time, Albe¦it euen vpon the point and beginning of his new fondaci∣on, beinge redie wt all to expose frutes of his happye chang frome euill to good trade, he was encowntred wyth the malice of his destinies, which abridged hys felicytie and life in one moment, wherof you maye discerne a manifeste profe in the sequeile of the historie folo∣wing.
PERILLO SVFFRETH muche for the loue of Carmosyna, and ma∣rienge her in the ende, vvere both tvvo stri∣ken to deathe with a thonderbolte, the firste nighte of their vnfor∣tunat mariage. IT happened (not long synce) in the riche and populus Citie of NAPLES, who nor∣risheth ordinarylie an infinitie of youth of all degrees, that, amongest the rest of the wantons broughte vpp there at that tyme, there was one named Anthonio Perillo, who enioyenge a libertye more then was necessarye to one of so younge yeres and greene vnderstandyng, made absolute declaracion (affore the race of youthe did stopp in hym), what it is to passe the yeres of cor∣rection without the awe of parentes, tutour or control∣ler: for his father hauyng performed his Jornaye, whi∣che nature appointed hym in this woorlde, resigned hys bodie to earthe, and his goodes and possessions to his sonne, who fyndyng so manye golden cotters and chestes full of treasure, to assiste his prodigal and wanton dispocision, for∣gat not ymediatly to enter into the trade of a licencius life. Wherein he founde no staye nor ympedyment to his will, for that the necligence of his father, had lefte hym withoute the awe or authoritie of any. And albeit in the life of his fa∣ther he was a continuall hawnter of the Berlea or common Dicesing house. house of vnthriftie exercises, where, for wante of sufficient demers to furnishe his desier, with skill in casting the three deceitfull companions of blacke and white vppon a square
table, he was forced often tymes to forbeare to playe, and learne conynge in lokyng vppon, yet tyme with his owne diligence, made hym so artificiall, that beyng but a cryer of awme, there were fewe hable to excede his sleyghte in ca∣stinge twelue affore sixe of two dyce, or tooke halfe so good accomte or regarde to the course of the cardes, and yet not∣withstanding he was not so wel grownded in the principles of his arte, but often tymes (his conyng beguilyng hym) he was preuented with a contrarie sleighte, and onelye his purse paide the charge of the whole companye, whiche was not vnmarked of some two or three of the famyliars of hys father, the respect of whose frendship and vertue, with son∣drie argumentes of ymynent destructiō to his sonne, moued theym to enter into tearmes of admonicion, layinge affore him the circumstance of his sondrie faltes, but chiefly repre∣hendinge the greate wronge he did to his owne estimacion, for that the waye to atteyne to renowne of vertue, was Perillo repre¦hēded of cer teine his fren des. cleane contrary to the vicious pathe of ydle playe, wherein he walked with more delite then belonged to the sonne of so good a father, they gaue hym examples of the destruc∣tion of manye, and not one that vsed that ydle exer∣cise dyed eyther with honour, wealthe, or estimacion, that it was the shopp and storehowse of all morders blasphe∣my, periurye, thefte, glottonie, whoredome, with an in∣fynitie The house of play, a store house of all vices, of other mortall incōueniences, and in thende, when plaie hadd lefte his purse without a lynyng, and he not ha∣ble any longer to feede the vaine of that humor, but by vn∣lawfull meanes, he sholde be payde wyth the hyer of theym who without commission skowringe the plaines do pray of what the fynde, and after yeldes accompte to the hangman Tenaunte by the high vvay side called theaues in plaine en∣glyshe vppon the fatall hill, with a skarffe or collor of corde aboute their necke in token of glorie: They required a regarde to the honour of his auncestors, but chiefly not to discredit the honeste lyfe of his late father, for that (saye they) as the vyrighte doyng of the child liuing susteyneth the renowme
of the father beyng dead, so there can happen no greater in∣famie to the sō, then not to make good the vertue and ciuill partes of his father, for ende they aduysed hym to dysmisse his prodigall trade of lyfe affore he were vtterly bankeroute of patrimonie and possession, but he not liking to be pinched so neare the quicke, and muche lesse to heare the secrettes of his falte so plainely decipherede, replied accordynge to the discrecion of our wilfull youth now adaies, giuen whollie to feede vppon thapetite of their foolyshe fancie, that touchyng the companies he hawnted, they were no worse then suche as were norished in the houses of princes, and familiar com∣painons to the greatest lordes of the countreye, and for the reste as he was not to yelde accompte of his lyfe to anye of theym, so he wished theym to bestowe that care vppon their owne children, for hym, he was of sufficiēt yeres to gouerne hym selfe, and giue conuenient order to suche affaires as be∣longed to his trade, wherewith he stopped the further replie of tholdmen, who noting tharrogante tearmes of this prin∣ckocks, committed hym to the meede of his owne follie, iud∣gynge no time conuenient to reclayme hym, til he had felte the smarte of the whipp famyn and penury, with other pin∣ching ertremities attendyng the ende of an vnthriftye life. But he that scamed inuincible againste all good councel, was made tractable by hym that plieth the most stronge and Loue. stubborne vppon earthe, and that which men accomptes the only blindnes of yt world, vnsealed the eyes of this yoūgling and so tooke awaye the vaile of his arrogante follie, that ac∣knowledging euerie pointe wherein he had offende, he was not onely priuie to his owne falte, but also pertaker of the penance. And as one poyson driueth oute an other, and no one vice that is not subiecte to the correctiō of an other falte, soo by that inuincible ympression whyche the Poetes haue painted in the shape of a blynde boye properly called loue, this gamster was not onely forced to a spedye chaunge and alteracion of lyfe, but also after sondrie and sharpe showers of aduersatie, restored to his auncient entyer and place of
honour and estimacion: for at the same instante within Na∣ples, soiorned a riche merchante blessed at goddes handes chiefly with a faire and vertuous doughter called Carmosyna, whose only beautie made more breaches into the harte of Antonio Perrillo then the graue admonicions of thelders or any other of his frendes, and albeit he was (as it were) soo bewitched and drowned in the deuocion of playe, that all tymes seamed hatefull, whyche broughte hym not fresh sup∣plies of gamsters, yet hauynge once glaunced vppon the glisteringe eyes of this younge girle, he coulde not so well gouerne his encounter, that not onely the desier of that ydle exercise was cleane mortefyed in hym, but also he suffred hym selfe imediatly to be enrolled in the booke of loyall lo∣uers, in suche sorte as he neuer delited so much in any plaie at the dise, as nowe he doateth vppon the beautie of Carmo∣sinae, who for her parte, notynge sondrie entisynge glées, whyche nature had lente to the younge man, together with his bowntefull dispocition, with braue attyre and courtlyke wearing his apparell, whyche as it is one chyef allurement that somons yt affection of a woman at this day, so the found woman wil rather delite in his smal waste, and exterior pro porcion, then ymbrase the vertue and giftes of cōmendacion in a man, thoughte it an effect of equal courtesie, to retorne his affection with semblable loue, wherefore yf he selte any tormente, her passion was nothynge inferior, whiche also grewe to tearmes of doble gréefe on bothe partes, for that they durst neither vse ytcredit of any messinger to discouer their darke meanynge, and muche lesse were they assysted with meanes of conference or accesse together, for that the maides thear are bownde to a more strayte talke of libertie, then in our countree, but for thoppynion of their chastetie I leaue it to the iudgment of them that haue had indifferent experience of bothe the places. But Perillo, as moste hott∣ly assailed, and leaste hable to resiste thalaram, and felynge a taste of that whereof he was ignoraunte in thoperation, & doubting altogether of thaccidēt til nature made him vnder∣stand
the mistery, entered into his laborinth of endles an∣noye, rauynge and raginge with hollowe dreames, with doubte which of his wittes he mighte moste boldly employe in bewraieng his vehemente affection to the newe mistrys of his harte, of whose good will, if he had but a symple assu∣rance by the breath of her owne mouth, he seamed not to doubte any waye the consente of her, for that thinequali∣tie of degrée and honor, rested on his side, perswadyng with∣al that the merchant wolde willingly admit thallyaunce be∣cause the mariage wold bringe a medley of honour vnto the base and darke complexion of his howse. But in this accōpt he forgatt the chiefest charge, and that which at this daye is most respected in makinge of mariages, I meane wealthe & possessions, whereof Perillo had alreadie made marchandise & exchanged the moste of that whiche was his, for a simple remembraunce of vaine delites passed, neyther did he consi∣der Riches most respected in mariages novv a dayes. the condicion of his presente state, with diminucion of his aunciente fame & honestie by a general brute of his vn∣thristie life, all which notwithstandinge, loue forced hym to trie the forde, and sounde the harte of the faire Carmosyna, assisting him also with a meane to haue thacquaintance of an old matrone, her outwarde gouernesse and inwarde cre∣dit of harte, whom he dandled with suche peppered perswa∣cions, and infections of certeine crownes, fallynge willing∣ly into her pockett, that she gaue assuraunce of her helpe to thuttermost, both in folowing and solicityng the matter, yf it were once sett a broch by hym selfe, whiche he performed by her the next daye in a letter of this or like effecte. God forbidd, that any part of my bodye sholde refuce to con∣discende Perillo vvri∣teth to Car∣mosy na. to that whiche my harte hath alredye vowed tou∣chinge my humble seruice on your behalfe (good madam) whose onely beautye ceassynge not to mainteine continuall quarel with mine auncient quiet, hath restored me to so ge∣neral and mortal a passion, that without the present dewe of pitie distillynge from the spedie consente of your fauor, I doubte whether nature is hable any longer to giue norri∣ture
to the feble partes of my weary corps, And seinge the intent of my affection is not onely boyde of all dissembling and flatteringe abuses in the vertue of true loyaltie, but al∣so ymportes a meaninge and humble request of lawfull ma∣riage, I craue hereby a confirmacion of your good will tou∣chinge the same, to thende that wyth the consente of your fa∣uor, I may march with more assurance, to demaunde you of your father. I nede not prefer the honor and nobilitie of my house, to moue you to indifferent consideracion of me, seinge your selfe can decipher sufficiently the particularities of my whole discente, neither put you in remembrance of thautho∣ritie whiche of longe hathe bene due to mine auncestors in this publike weale, for that you are not ignorante of anye parte of the same, all which if they lacke force to moue you to iust compassion, dispose your selfe (good Lady) to the viewe of my present martirdom, and measuringe the iustice of my merit wyth the greatnes of my gréef, to sende the messenger of spedie consolacion to hym, who pyning in his laborinth of vnfayned loyaltie, attendes the happie newes of your con∣sent, and in the meane while doth humblie kisse the hande of the paragon Carmosyna. Your loyall seruante Antonio Perillo. The girle not earst accustomed to receiue such embassages, seamed to prefer some litle astonishment at the first view of the letter, not for that she misliked the contentes, but to pre∣uent cause of suspicion in her whom she neded not haue dow¦ted, if she had bene priuie to the resolute league betwene her newe seruant & old gouernes, who also for her part forgat not here to applie the cataplame of her promise for com∣mending the sondrie good partes of the gentleman, perswa∣ded her that it was an effecte of vertue to aide thaffliction of such as suffer distres, and that her honestie cold no way stād in awe of slaunder in requiting a most loyall and vnfayned loue with reciprocal affectiō, besides saith she, in the allyance
consistes a decoracion and increase of honor to al your house wherwyth, indeuoring yet to sporr her, who of her self was sufficiently bent to ronne that cariare, wrested at last not on¦ly an equall loue in the girle, but also a confirmacion of the same by a letter whych she retorned vnto hym vnder thies tearmes. Aswel by the roundnes of your letter (Sir) as relacion of my gouernes, I vnderstande the franke offer of your vnfayned Carmosyna aunsvve rethe the letter of Perillo. frendshipp, wherin as the iustire of your meritt moueth me to expose thuttermost of the consideracion that my power is hable to performe, so I greue that any restrainte shold be an ympediment to ye liberal recompense of the large honor you offer me by my parentes, from whom albeit muste procede the chief and principal aunswere to your demaunde, for that the yoke of dutifull obedience kepeth the graunt of my good will vnder the awe of their consentes, yet seynge the vehe∣mencie of your loue which hath deuyded himselfe into a sim¦pathia or equalitie of affection in vs both, & reaposing muche for my selfe in thintegretie of your meaninge, I wishe my father wold rather admit your presēt request, then delibrate vpon the choise of other husband for me, wherfore my aduise is you giue a charge of his good will wyth suche tearmes as you accompt most conueniēt to fede the humor of angry old men, therpedicion wherof I commit to the vehemente sug∣gestion of your inward desier, whiche (without the consente of my parentes) I can not satisfye otherwayes, then wyth a simple zeale, wherof I send you herewith tharticles of assu∣rance sealed wyth thunfayned faith of youre most deare and loyall. Carmosynae. The operacion of this aunswer seamed of suche force, in the hart of Antonio, that he ymagined he embrased at thinstante the faire Carmosna, perswading alredie a resolute consomaci¦on of the bargaine by old Minio her father, to whō with more hast then good spede, he declareth the next morninge, the ho∣nor and honest loue he bare to his doughter, with desier that
he wold admit him for his son in lawe, wherein his expecta∣cion was not onely frustrat, for that the replye of the mar∣chante seamed to excede the compasse of his conceite, but al∣so ymported tearmes of reaproch, & reprehending his disor∣dred Mynio denie the to mary his doughter to Perillo. youthe aduised him that affore he went about to ma∣rie, to learne some trade to redeme his possession or elles, procure such compotente porcion, as mighte both susteyne hym selfe and familie, and also preuente the miseries of olde¦age, yf god blessed hym with so longe a tyme in this world, for (saith he) I will not cōmit my doughter to any, but such as hauyng sufficient to menteine her estate, is also careful too encrease that whyche god and fortune haue ymparted vnto theim, neither shall the respect of your pleasure, moue me to condiscende to the misery of her, whome you saye you loue, for I wishe rather to see the iuste destruction of thone, then thindifferent desolacion of you bothe, meruetlinge also that loue hath sturred vp this requeste in you, seinge that yf you honored Carmosina in suche sorte as you saye, you wolde also be carefull of her aduancement, but as I see and knowe well enoughe, that the wanton instigacion of a folishe ap∣petit so moueth you to make a demaūde of that which shame and raison forbidde you not onely to pursewe, but also per∣swades you to exclude vtterlie oute of your remembraunce, so lett thyes fewe wordes suffice for a resolute aunswere, that the viewe of your vnthriftie life hetherunto, with the nedefull condicion of your presente estate, makes you vn∣worthie and vnhable to enioye her whom otherwayes you sholde haue founde me no lesse willing to haue ioyned in cō∣sente, then you desierons to demaunde her in sorte of honest mariage. Thies laste wordes and aunswere not loked for of tholde marchant, broughte no small perplexitie to our pore Perillo, who by the vehemencye of his passion, was forced to aban∣don the place and retire to his lodginge, where, with tunes of greate dollour he entered into a suruoye or viewe of his former lyfe in this sorte. Ys it possible (saith) he that pouer
tie shall brynge me in contempte, and kepe from me the vse of the thinge whereof I made so sewer accompte? or is the re∣membrance of the ydle exercises of my wanton youth past, The cōplaīt of perillo. the onelye ympediment to this newe alliance with Minio? what reason hath he to denie me ye title of his son in lawe, & much lesse to heare me skarce speake in the demaunde of his daughter if not yt he seeth so general adyminucion of the por¦cion & possessiō, that wer lefte me, by my inordinat & prodigal trade of lyfe, fearing also that play (consumyng me by péece meale) will leaue me in the ende neyther reuenue nor re∣nowme, nor skarcelye a simple remembrance of the house whereof I tooke my begynnynge? I woulde myne eyes bad béene séeled, and handes tormented with the quyueryng palsey, when firste I learned the subtilities and sleigtes of cardes and dise. I wishe I had bene bound to a taske of paine∣full toile without releace from trauell, when firste I gaue comission to that idle trade, to supplante all desier and ne∣cessary care in preseruinge ye entire of my fathers remaine? howe vnhappie was I alas to kicke at the councell of such, as reprehendyng my follies, preferred an affectioned care of my commoditie? why was I so vnthankefull to their zeale, and vnwillinge to follow their aduise? yf I had put a brydel to my pleasure, I had eschewed this hard penance of my vn∣thriftie youthe, which nowe I fynde (alas to late) to stande moste nede of the admonicions of ryper age, Ab I wolde I had sooner Sipped of the cup of loue, to the ende, that being broughte to the knowledge of that whereof I fynde to late an experience, I myghte haue preserued the greatest parte of that which I haue alredie loste, but what? shall my desa∣ster passed, take awaie the hope of a future fortune, or mor∣tefie all expectacion of thassistance of a better tyme? or is it a vertue to dispaire in distresse? no, lett rather the view of my disorder passed put me in remembrance to retire to a newe gouernement and trade of lyfe, in suche sorte, as with an honeste indeuour to make store of that whiche is leste, and
reclaime the reste that is gone, I maye giue absolute argu∣ment to the worlde of a chaunge and amendment of lyfe, which also may cōuert the hardnes of the harte of Minyo into a disposicion and desyer to confirme the honest league which I craue at his handes, where vpon he put suche expedicion to his newe deuise, that in one instante, renouncynge euery pointe and circumstance of his former life, he was transfor∣med from the forme and inclinacion of a seconde Acolastus into the shapp of a sparinge marchant, wherewith takynge thaduise of some of his frendes, who also assisted his honeste indeuor with some porcion of money, he conuerted the smal remeinder of his inheritaūce, into some thrée or foure thou∣sande crownes (with an intente to beare an aduenture with certeine marchantes that were vpon the pointe to furnish a voyage from Leuant to Alexandria, a Citie in Egypte buil∣ded by the greate Alexander, being at this daye thonly trade of the Easte partes, for all sortes of spices and other mar∣chandise of greate value, and from whence (for the moste parte) the Venetians, Genoeys, Florentins and other countreyes of Italye keping their banke and store houses there, doo fur∣nishe all Europe with such kinde of necessarie traffique. The infortunat Perillo conuerted wholly (as you sée) into a marchante venteror, with no lesse desyer to restore his wealth, with the gaine of his present trade, then earste he had delite to consume all in idle exercise, committes his por∣cion to his fortune, and amongest the reste of the aduen∣turers, hoysseth saile in hope of better spede then it was his chaunce to encoūter, for they were not fyftye leagues vpon the mayne Sea, when they were sharpelye assailed by an angry Neptune, who mislikynge theyr voyage, sett a broche the malice of the windes, forcynge the Sea to so hyghe a billatt and vnruly rage of the waues, that thim∣petuositie of the tempeste, toke awaye the force of the pylottes and maryners in suche sorte, as beinge no longer hable to resiste the furye of the storme com∣mitted theim selues and shipp to the mercye of the waues,
whiche ceassed not to continue in extreme furye the space of thrée dayes and nightes without intermission, in whyche tyme theyr fortune had put theym vppon the coaste of Bar∣baria, where the malice of the windes appaised, and the Sea retired to his ordinarie quiete, albeit thignorance of the coaste and countrey (a common enemye to all christendom) offred theim cause of newe feare, yet the viewe of their late perill passed, mortifyed all suggestion of newe sorowe, and procured theim to a more congratulacion then if they hadd alredye performed their expedicion, and were saflye arriued in the harbor of Leuant. But fortune, who had yet an other acte of tragical malice to presente vnto thies wretches, lay in waite to assaile them with a seconde desaster more extreme then the firste, whose alaram made a conuercion of their hymnes and Psalmes of reioycinge, into teares and dollorous exclamacions: for as they lay at anker, in the euenyng when the nighte began to couer the earthe with his darke mantell, beholde a pirott of the Mores (partaker also of the malice of their tēpeste) beset theim vpon a soddaine, with certeine brigandines (most fitt vessells to do a mischiefe in a calme, and charged theim so whotly on all sides, that beinge alredye for wearied with the tormente of their peril passed, and not hable to expose suffi∣cient Perillo taken prisonner and his goods spoiled. resistance to their vnrulye force, were layde aborde wyth small effucion of blood, their goodes spoiled, and theim selues caryed prisoners to Thunys to lyue in extreme miserye vnder the seruile yoke of the Barbarous nations. Here yf the maister cried oute for the loss of hys shipp, the Mariners to be depriued of theyr hyer, and the mar∣chantes to sée the spoile of theyr goodes wyth hindrance of theyr venture, I leaue you to be iudges of the passion of poore PERILLO, who dispairinge to be redemed, for that his whole substance was committed to pillage in that mis∣fortune, exclaimed againste thiniquitye of the godes, for that they seamed to fauour his miserye with a tearme of

Ah Carmosyna what wrōg dost thou to my misery, if thy teares do not helpe to la∣ment my distress, seing yt in seking to haue the to my wyfe,
I am maryed to a heauie burden of boltes and shackells of yron, and in place of my mariage bedde with the, my de∣stenies haue appoynted me a pillowe of carthe in a darke and filthie hoale, where notwithstanding yf there were any offer of hope eftesones to enioye thy presence, I coulde ea∣sely disgeste the Symptomes of my martirdome, and in atten∣ng the happie consent of such good fortune to make a plai∣ante exercyse of my presente and paynefull ymprison∣ment. By this tyme fame had ymparted the desolacion of our venturers to the whole Citie of Naples, not withoute the ge∣nerall sorowe of all men, and speciall teares of such as were contributarie to the losse, albeit makyng of necessitie a ver∣tue, tyme gaue ende to their dollor and dismissed theym all, with desier to redeme his captif frend, but Carmosyna know∣yng her PERILLO to be one of the miserable nomber, and waighing the circumstance of his mishapp, whiche stode vp∣pon tearmes of more extremitie then all the reste, bothe for that by the losse of his porcion, she douted to set him on foote againe, and muche more dispaired of meanes to paye hys raunson, entred into suche presente rage, that she was redy to vse force againste herself, whereunto she hadd putt an ef∣fect, if it had not bene for her gouernesse, who reprehending sharply her wilfull follie, appeased at laste (with greate rai∣son) her desperatt intente, conuertynge the furious humor of the desolate mayde into a riuer of teares, distillynge a mayne downe her reasie chekes, complayninge notwith∣standynge with tearmes of gréef, the misfortune of her frende, but chiefly for that her selfe was the principall cau∣se of his ruynous estate, and that the rude aunswere of her father forced him to abandon his countrey, for the gaine of a contynuall captiuitie? Ah infortunat girle (saieth she) and insatiable couetusnes in the old age of my father, who in refusing the honest request Carmosina complayneth the misery of perillo. of Perillo, respected more the masse of filthie treasure, then
the vertues or good disposicion in the younge man? Why wolde not he consider that the manners of men do chaunge, & of a prodigall youthe procedes a sparing olde man, neither oughte we to dispaire of his recouerie, who fynding ye falte of his owne follie, disposeth him selfe to amendment of life. what cause of care hathe he either of the pouertie or rich of his children after his death, seynge the remembrance of the worlde dekayeth with the loss of lyfe? can he carie with hym any care of our aduauncement, seynge he is forced to leaue behynde hym the thynge whyche is more deare vnto hym then the prosperetie or healthe of hys children? yf he Riche presente me with a husbande and porcion of a kingdom, the offer of no millions shall mortefie in me the loue I beare my PERILLO, neither is it a vertue to sell affection for the price of monie, and muche lesse to seame to loue hym, whom my harte can not brooke, for there is neyther pleasure nor contententent where the mynde is not in quiett. No, no, lett hym vse the skoape of hys crabbed age, and do what he thynkes good, for my parte, I will not be desloy∣all on the behalfe of hym, who I knowe honoreth me with sincere affection neyther shall he lye longe in prison, nor contynue any tyme the sonne of pouertie, for I knowe wher be a companie of duckattes whyche sawe no lyghte since, I hadde the vse of discrecion, whyche I doute not will bothe pawne his deliuerie, and furnyshe hym wyth a seconde trade more fortunate (I hope) then the firste, and for my parte, the gréenes of my age, gyueth me leaue to suspend certeine yeres without any haste to marie, wherein she demaunded thassistance of her gouernes, who gaue her not onely a firme assurance of her ayde, but also promised a supply of monie towardes the furniture of her expedicion, desieringe her for the reste, to do awaye all ar∣gumentes of dollar, leaste the same discouered her passion to her father, wherein as they consumed certeine monethes in beauise to deliuer PERILLO, with secrett practisses in
leuienge the price of his raunsom so fortune began to en∣ter into tearmes of pitie towardes hym, and preuented the meanyng of his mystris, by takyng hym oute of prison in sorte as you shall heare. Wherein albeit she exceded the mayde with spede in excu∣cion, yet oughte wee to gyue the title of worthie thankes to Carmosyna, whose example of vertue in this case I wishe maie sōmon a remorce to our lighte and inconstante dames nowe a dayes, who are so incerteine in true affection, that A speciall chalenge. the respecte of presente pleasure, takes awaye the remem∣brance of their absente frende, and maketh theim vnmynd∣full of the faith of their former promisse, wherin I am not prouided to enter into argument at this presente, bothe for that I dot to gaine displeasure in discoueryng a truth, and also suche discourse is without the compasse of my comissiō, whiche is nowe to recompte vnto you the deliuerie of pore Antonio. Olde Minyo the father of Carmosyna had ioyned with hys richesse and desyer of worldly gaine, certeine vertues and commendable giftes, as veraye deuote in visiting the chur∣ches and places of prayer, of a charitable disposicion in rele∣uing the distresse of thafflicted, and so full of compassion on the behalf of the nedie, that seldome any pore man departed from hym emptie handed, besides, he extended amerueilus charitie and acte of pitie to the desolate captiues amongeste the Moares, in suche sorte, as making euery yere a voyage in∣to Barbaria, he made an ordinarie, to redeme and bring awaie with hym ten or twelue christian prisoners, of whome such as were hable, restored the price of their raunson, whithout any interest, thinkinge the gaine sufficient in that he was the cause of their deliuerie, but the reste he sente frelie into their countrey exspectynge the méede of that vertue at the handes of god, with this onely charge, that in remēbrance of the benefit, they wold not forget him in their priuat praiers. The gifte of welth was not euill bestowed vpon this mar∣chant, considering he was thankefull in ymparting it to the
poore, accordinge to thadmonicion of the gospell, but howe manye maye a man reckon in england, that excedes hym in riches, and skarce one of semblable vertue, for the peruersa∣tie of our age is comme to that pointe, that wheare our fa∣thers and grandfathers delited in workes of charitie, with care to supplie the necessitie of suche as did wante, our Hel∣loes & golphes of riches do not only close their eares against the lamētable cries of the néedie, but also make no consciēce to dispoile theim, either by awe, feare or flattery, of that litle which their fortune hath lefte theim, in such sorte, that Al∣mes and deuocion seames such straungers & so litle knowē amongest men now a dayes, that of thies fewe that soccour the poore, the moste parte, do it rather of vayne glorie, or to condemne the barbarus disposicion of hys neyghbor, thē for compassion on the behalfe of him that standes in nede: hospi∣talitye is also so vnknowen amongeste vs, that where oure auncestors buylded houses endowinge theim with sufficiēt reuenues to susteine thimpotent and nedye persons, with frée annuities and other meanes of reléefe, how many of the members of christe do we sée in our tyme voyde of harbour to shroode their naked bodies, full of diseases, pinched with extremitie of honger and colde, redie to giue vpp the ghost at the gate of the richeman, & yet not reliued with so muche as the cromes that fall from his table: I borowe thusmuche on the office of the preacher, not with intent to charge hym any waye with imputacion of negligence in the pulpit touching his admonicion to the people to assiste the distresse of suche as god visiteth with the Rodde of affliction, but in presenting our marchantes with a familiar example of the office & dutie of a true christian, to sturr theym to the ymy∣tacion of the like vertue, and in beinge ashamed, that suche as haue gone affore vs, haue caried with theym to heauen, all effectes of charitie, to dispose theym selues to seame worthye of that whiche they haue, by yeldynge a certeyne tenth or tribute of their goodes to suche as ye scripture tear∣meth the deputies of christe askinge it in his name.
But now to our father Minio, who for that by thimpediment of sicknes, was not hable to performe his voyage to Thunys, The poore man demaun¦ding his al∣mes is the de¦putie of Christ, vvho saithe vvhat vve geue to the nedy vve bestovve vp∣pon hym. in person, duringe the yere of ymprisonment of the Napoly∣tans, gaue charge to certeine his factors to redeme ten Cap∣tiues of his countrey, or at least to furnishe the nomber with any that professed the Lawe of Christ, which was performed accordingly with such good fortune on the behalfe of Antonio Perillo, that he enioyed a perticipacion of the deuocion and benefite of Minio, and was sent to Naples amongest the rest that were redemed, not beinge knowen notwithstanding of any his coprisoners or other of ye company, for that they had not had any great enterview together, and muche lesse of his Perillo re∣demed from pryson. famylyar frendes, seinge the penurie of imprisonemente had set a die of hideus compleriō vpon his face, and his heare and beard exceding their ordynarie length, had ouergrowen certeine speciall markes whiche els had discouered hym more easely. But what can beguile the eye of a louer, or who is hable to conceile from a womā the face of him, whose picture she beareth in the bottom of her hart, and whose re∣membrance death hym selfe is skarce hable to deface, Carmo∣syna, which made her thought a loking glasse to beholde eue∣ry day thymage of her Perillo, had no soner glaunced simplie vpon hym, but she knew it was he, who for her sake had pas∣sed the panges of so manye tormentes, wherewith no lesse glad of his retorne, then hee doble dowtfull of the contynu∣ance of her good wyll, wrought so muche by the sleighte of her gouernesse, that she had place of conferrence with hym in secrete, where after certeine congratulacions of his delyuerye shee exposed tearmes of compforte in this sorte. Albeit (sayth she) fortune hath bene so incensed agaynste Carmosyna comfortethe Perillo. you, that she hath neither spite nor malice in store whereof you haue not tasted to thuttermost force and extremitie, yet your Carmosyna hathe neyther forgot anye parte of thaun∣cient goodwil she hath borne you nor much lesse entred into the leaste contempte that may be ymagyned, but where a
nomber of other Ladies, would haue dismissed their affection at the firste sommonce of aduersatie, I am here to aduouche an vndowted contynuacion of zeale, wyth a treble increase of true loue towardes you, wherof I am also to yelde you a present proofe in doble sort the one wyth an assurance of re∣ciprocal amytie vntil thextreme date of my dayes, the other, in consideracion that your pouertie proceded by my meanes. I haue prouyded a seconde supplie of monie to renewe efte¦sones your traffique, which being guided by a better fortune wil yelde you (I hope) a successe of suche commoditie as my father will denye you no more the title of hys sonne in law, whereof for my parte, I pronownce (from thinstante) suche confirmacion as is in me to performe: These newes vnloked for, sturred vpp a traunce of such alteracions in the trobled mynde of Perillo, that what with the gredie desyer hys eyes had to féede vpon her bewtie, whych he had not regarded of longe tyme but by inwarde contemplacion, and the passion of present gladnes in thassurance of her loue, wyth a franke offer of spedie assistance to restore hys trade, he had neyther the vse of hys tongue to expose tearmes of thanks, and much lesse the consent of hys sences to beleue that which he hard, but as one Zenopholus attēding the aunswere of hys oracle or soddeinly striken wyth a dome apploplexie, stode as immo∣uable as thymage of saint petre in the Capitoll of Rome, till she rechargde hym wyth a seconde consolacion, and withall presented hym wyth certeine bagges full of duckattes, wher of she wylled hym to defraie the value of his raunsome to the factors of her father, and dispose the rest in a second venture for marchandise, which he performed accordinglie, wyth the benefyt of so good tyme and fortune, that sailyng with a pros¦perus wynde to Leuant, he made hys markett to such aduan∣tage, that (in hys reatorne to Naples,) thincrease and gaine of his trade, redemed euery possession which earst he solde, and left hym besides sufficiente to furnishe his lackes in euery respecte, in suche sorte, as the common iudgemente passed,
that his welthe was nothinge inequall to the richesse of his father, and his present state as plentiful of all thinges as the first day he seased vppon the coffers and remaine of olde Perillo: amongest the rest of the frendes of Antonio, whyche reioysed his happie fortune, Carmosyna I am sewer was not leaste glad, chiefly for that she sawe her father begin to grow in delite with the doinges of the younge man, who for hys part also renewinge a dayly increase of affection towardes his mistres, was in deuise, by what meanes he might eftso∣nes bord the goodwil of her father, whō he iudged colde vse small reason in refusinge his requeste, seinge his richesse were equall to thappetit of his gredie mynde, and his posses∣sions and patrymony nothing inferior to the best of ye Citie, wherfore for the more honor and solemnitie of the demand, he sent hys vncle to sommon the faire Carmosyna, in sorte of lawfull mariage with an offer of dowry at the discrecion of her father, who not ignorante of the league of longe loue be∣twene his doughter and Perillo, whome hee knewe to haue firste entred into chaunge of lyfe for the onely respect of her fauor, thought it as great conscience to condiscende, as they had reason to make the request, wherupon addinge an effect of expedicion to their present agrement, the bale of contract was drawen and the mariage published ymediatly betwene Antonio Perillo and the faire Carmosyna to the speciall content Perillo and Carmosyna maried. ment of theym selues and singler pleasure of the parentes on both sides, which notwythstandinge was vnhappelye ab∣bridged contrarye to all their exspectacions, by the malice of a pitifull accident which fell vpon theym the very night of their mariage in the house of tholde Minio: it was in the mid∣dest of the moneth of Iune, at what time the heates beinge most vehemente, do force terrible thonders and rage of wea∣ther in great extremitie, by certein drye vapours and exha∣lacions whych the heat ayre draweth vp from the drye earth when as our infortunat Louers were newe gon to bedd, de∣uisinge together of their sondrye misfortunes since the be∣gynnynge

The argument. THe tragicall chaunces happeninge to¦th infortunate sorte of this world, albe∣it at the firste, do present a certeine bit∣ter tast with vnsauerye disgestion, yet who Syfteth theym to the quicke, con∣struinge rightly euerye cause of their commyng, and vertue in operacion, wil not only iudge theim necessarie for some respectes, but al∣so discerne in theim an indifferent proffit and pleasure to all degrees of present being, but specially, to future poste∣rities, who may learne by the view of former illes, to es∣chewe the like harmes in theim selues: And because eue∣ry thinge is appointed his peculiar season, and al actes can¦not agre with euery time and al places, I haue deuised, that as I began my histories with a comiqual discourse, So I intende to knit up with a tragicomiqual reaport treating chiefly vpon the selfe same subiect, which the fonde do cō∣monly Loue. prefer as a speciall couerture or sheelde of their faltes. Thexperience is not straunge nowe a dayes, what humor of rage doth directe our fraile youth, gouerned by the pla∣net of loue, and what mortall inconuenience dothe and wold springe thereupon, if reason serued not in some sorte as a moderacion of our follie euen from the cradle to the ful maturitie of our age, quallefyeng besides by wholsom principles, the heate of our wilfull appettites, wherin like as amongest all the tyranous enemies which afflicte the bodie or mynde of man, he only gloriethe of force to alter our propper nature, what perfection so euer it ymporte, conuerting our libertie into a disposicion of seruile thral∣dome, guided only by the reyne of his discrecion, So amon
the nomber of authorities heretofore alledged for the profe of the same, I haue thought good to preferr an example of ourtyme, happening in a gentlemā of Catalonia, who decla¦ringe in him selfe by his togreat constancie two extremy∣ties of loue and follie, hath also painted out the picture of a gentlewoman, no lesse light and inconstante, then loue and such as followe his loae be vaine, seing the small ver∣tue whiche assistes their sonde indeuor, and slender commoditie, gro∣winge by their vncerteiue seruice.
A WONDERFVL CON∣stācie in Dom Diego, who for the respect of Geniuera la blonde, vndertoke a harde Pennance vppon the mountes pyrenei, where he ledd the lyfe of an hermytt till hèe was found out by chaunce by one of hys frendes, by whose helpe he recouered both fauor and mariage of hys cruell mistres. VPon the confynes of Catalonia, deuydinge Barcellonia and the mountes, liued not lōg since an auncient Lady, the wydowe and late wife of a knight of that contrey, who left her only a daughter to supplie hym in succession, and giue comforte to the de∣solacion and old yeres of her mother, in whom appered rather a fonde zeale, then awfull diligence in theducation of her childe, for that she se∣med more willinge to flatter the vaine humor of her young yeres, then careful to reprehend the argumentes of wanton dispocision apperinge in the younglinge, who, besides her curius shapp of body, and lymmes, with wonderful perfecti∣on of bewtie wherein nature gloreth yet of her conninge, was assisted wyth so fayre a haire, fallinge by deuyne arte in to crisped lockes, deuidynge theym selues (as it were by ap∣pointmente) that the golde purifyed and tryed by the flame of the furnaise, seamed but a darke metall, in respecte of the glisteringe glee of her curled haire, whereby shée was cal∣led of all men Geniuera la blonde, not far from whose castell
or place of a bode, was ye dwelling of an other vertuouse wy∣dow, of noo lesse estimation, for her riches & large dominions then the other, and of equall honour and renowme for ho∣neste life, who hauynge only the presence of a son, to restore the remembrance of her deade husbande, vsed no lesse care to brynge hym vpp in the discipline of euery vertue, studie of good letters, together with a participation in thexercise of all noble recreacions couenient for a gentleman of his condicion and calling, then the faire Geniuera reapposed feli∣citie in the beautie of her glorious heare, wherein to assiste the natural towardines of her son, she sent him to Barcelonia, the chefest citie of the contrey, where fortune fauoured his diligence with suche dexteritie in all thynges, that vppon the eyghtenth yeare of his age, his perfection in learnyng, with wonderfull sleyghte in exploytes of chiualrye, gaue causes of shame to all gentlemen and other degrees what so euer norrished and bredd vpp in the lyke exercises, why∣che sturred vpp suche contentemente in the good Ladie hys mother, that she knewe not with what countenance to co∣uer the pleasure shee tooke in the felicitie of her sonne, a falte familiar enoughe to a nomber of fonde menne, and a vice moste common to all mothers, who glorienge in the towardenes of their children, do flatter theym selues with an vncerteine hope of their future vertue, wherein they do indifferente wronge to their owne ymagination, and ad∣uauncement of theyr wilfull and wanton youth, who blyn∣ded with vayne perswacion of creaditt of their parentes, do thynke theym selues dispensed with all frome further dili∣gence, or to expose effectes of other dutie, whereuppon followeth often tymes a nomber of indifferent myshappes to theym bothe, with cause of equall rebuke to the one and the other: and so pursewyng the queste of my hystorye, it happened in the florishynge yeares of thys younge gentle∣man Dom Diego, that Phillipp of Austriche onely heyre to hys father newlye deceased, passynge thorowe Fraunce towardes Spaine to inueste hym selfe in the Seignories
of hys late father, gaue warnynge of hys comynge to the Citie of BARCELONIA, who for their parts, entred yme∣diatly into deuise, touchinge the pompp and magnifisence, wherewith they mighte do honor to the maiestie of so great a prince, as ye son of the Emperour of the Romaines, amon∣gest other solemnities, they dressed a riche and curious iust, furnyshynge the listes onely with younge gentlemen, here to fore not greatly exsperienced in the vse of armes, wherof as Dom Diego, was chosen chiefe of thone parte, so the kyng (for a more contentement to hys subiectes) beynge vppon the skaffolde to iudge the loftie corage of thies younge gal∣landes, had onely his eyes vpon the younge DIEGO, with a wonderfull admiration of his force in so younge yeres, ar∣guyng an vndowted vertue with thincrease of further age, to whome onelye he awarded the glorie of the féelde, with protestation that in hys lyfe, he hadd not séene a medly bet∣ter performed, seamynge rather a battaill or combatt of ex∣perienced knyghtes, then an exercise of delicate youth, not yet accustomed to beare the burden of armour, and lesse ac∣quainted with the trauell of warr, wherewith aswell, in∣consideracion of the present towardnes in the wydowes son, with corage to contynue hys trade so well begon, as also to féede the hope and showe of his future vertue, he was ad∣mitted Dom Diego made knyght the nexte mornynge into the order of knigthode, in∣uested with the coller of sainte Andrewe and other ceremo∣nies of spaine, by the hande of the sayde Philipp, who after he had fulfilled the date of his aboue at Barcelonia, pursewed his iorney towardes Castile leauyng our newe knyghte Dom Diego reioysinge not a litle in his presente honor, ymparted vnto him by his prince, retiring with the newes of his good fortune to his owne possession and liuing, more to performe tharrerages of his dutie to his mother, whom the hadd not sene of longe tyme, then with intente to make longe staye there, or enter into delite with the pleasures yt be in the con∣trey, wherof notwithstanding he receiued so sewer a taste, that his captiuitye in the ende exceded euerye waye in
greatnes of greff, the restrainte of libertie or other mis∣like or impedimente he founde at any tyme in the Citye, like as also the Poetes haue ymagined that loue, pitchinge his tentes in deserte places not apte to discouerye, dothe discharge his dartes and arrowes in the thicket of wod∣des and forestes, vppon the borde of the Sea, or shaded fountaines, and some tyme vppon the heighte of the highest hilles in the pursewte of the Nimphes of all sortes, iudginge therby a libertie and moste sewer waye to treate vppon matters of loue, without suspicion, Ielousye, en∣uie, false reaporte, synister opinion or common crye of the people, to be in the wide and open feldes, where they maie be bolde to communicate their mutuall passion with∣out feare of witnesses, enioyinge also the pleasures of all kinde of chasses, whiche the champion doth norrishe, with participacion of the chirpinge harmonie and naturall mu∣sicke of birdes, and somtime the delitefull noise of sondrye pleasante chanels and siluer streames, qualyfyinge in their kinde the vehemencie of their languishinge greeffe, and recordinge also with greate ceremonie, the firste place of their amarus enteruiew or acquaintance, arguynge thereby treble felicitie to suche, as abandonynge the sondrie annoyes attendynge continuall abode in the Citie, do re∣sort to the pleasant lawndes in the contrey to yelde tribute of their studies to the muse, wherunto they be most affected, So Dom Diego, beinge at hoame loued enterely of his mo∣ther, & serued with all dutifull obedience of his subiectes and seruantes, after his ordinarie howers of studie were passed, vsed his chief pleasure in thexercise of ye felde, I meane some tyme to dislodge the great and loftie hart, to dresse the toiles to entrapp the wilde boare, and some tyme to trye the good∣nes of his hawke with the mayne winge of the hearon or fearefull partridge in the stuble feldes or valleys inuyroned with huge hills, wherein one daie amōgest the rest, hunting the wilde goate whiche he had forced from his habitation of the high and craggie rockes, he sawe launsing afore hym a
harte whiche his dogges had rozed and so hoatly purse wed, that (to his iudgemente) he seamed more then halfe spente, wherewith, aswell for the pleasure whiche the pastyme it selfe did offer hym, as also to ease the traueile of his howndes, he putt spurres to his horse, forcinge hym to a mayne gallopp, wherein he continued till, his houndes loasynge the tracke of theyr praye, were at defalte, and hym selfe without the sighte and hearyng of all hys men, wyth suche ignorance of the coste where he was, that he knewe no readie waye of retourne to his compa∣nie, and muche lesse the place where his fortune had put hym, greuynge moste in this perplexitie that his horse beinge oute of breath, refuced (for wante of force) to ca∣rye hym anye further, wherfore after he hadd blowen di∣uers calls for his men without other aunswere then an Eccho of the woddes and waters, he deuided his distresse into two pointes, the one to demounte and ease the wea∣rines of his horse, the other to retire backe by the same path whyche broughte hym thither, wherin his expectation was no lesse frustrate, then hym selfe deceiued by the ma∣lice of his fortune, for that meanyng to take the next way to his castell, he mett with a contrarye pathe, whiche af∣ter he had trauelled the moste parte of the afternoone, broughte hym in the ende, within the viewe of a stately house, builded vppon the side of a hill, whiche by cer∣teine markes appearinge on thuttermoste partes of the house, albeit argued the contrarie of his intente, yet, hearinge the bable of certeine hunters, ymagininge the same to be his people, drewe neare the place, whiche dis∣couered (aboue his exspectacion) A companie of strangers, beinge certeine seruantes of the mother of GENIVERA, whiche attended their mistres wyth a brase of younge greyhownds that had newlye ne a hare to deathe, and beinge thus rencountred with this seconde misfortune, he grewe also into tearmes of greater destresse then afore, for
that happroche of the nighte, begynninge to expose shadoes of darknes vppon the earth by the departure of the son, toke from hym all hope of other harbor, then the offer of some hollowe trée, or greene bedd vppon the grounde, when lo thauncient Ladye discernynge betwene the viewe of her eye, and regardes of the clowdes, whiche hadd not yet cloased in the lyghte of the firmamente, the shadowe of a man discendynge from the vppermost parte of a hil wyth his horse in his hande, seamynge by his maiestie, marching with the semblance of a prince, to be some degrée of honor, sente one of her men to knowe what he was, who reator∣ned with aunswere accordynge to his demaunde, wherup∣pon the Ladye wydowe with her faire doughter, indiffe∣rently gladd of thapproche of theyr neyghbour, whome al∣beit they neuer sawe, yet fame had made theim partakers of his vertue & renowme, wente in solemne order to mete hym, forgettynge no kynde of curteyse gretyng that belon∣ged to the honor and estate of so noble a personage, where∣vnto he replied with thankes accordinge to the greatnes of the benefytt, with addition, that he founde hym selfe greatly in the fauor of fortune, for that his painefull trauelle in wandryng so many howers, had giuen hym at laste so fit an occasion, to visitt the house, whereunto, he doubted not for his parte, to confirme the league of frendshipp begon and happelye continued of longe time by his parentes and pre∣decessours: the Ladye whose longe absence from the courte had not diminished her grace in courtelike conference, aun∣swered, that if they haue greatest cause of contentements that gaineth the moste, or if large benefittes, require ample consideration, it is she that ought to offer to fortune the sa∣crafize of thankesgeuinge, for that she hadd brought her a guest, no lesse deare then the life of her selfe, and as welcome as if the kynge of Spaine had don her the honor to visytt her castell, whiche sturred vpp in hym a seconde offer of his seruice, not onelye on her behalfe, but also towardes the leaste ymppe deryued of her house, wherewith, Geniuera,
to assiste the contentement of her mother in the companye of the younge knighte, with the pleasure she toke her selfe The first me∣ting & vvords betvven Die∣go and Geni∣uera. in his semelye conference, craued (in smylynge order) a participacion in peculiar of the liberall offer whiche he ex∣posed by generall tearmes to her mother and her whole house, DOMDIEGO whiche had not yet exceded an ordi∣narie regarde in beholdynge the beautye of the younge La∣dye, founde cause in the misterye of her woordes, to glaunce wyth more iudgement vppon her, in suche sorte, that at the instant he felt him self assailed with such soddaine alteration, that his astonishment woulde not giue hym leaue to aunswere, otherwayes then with a percynge glée of his eyes, fedynge with firme contemplation vpon the freshe dye of white and red, appearinge in all partes of her diuine face, wherein also for a more decoracion of this wonderfull worke of nature, thattire of her heade pre∣sented A discriptiō thattie and beautye of Geniuera. suche an artificiall deuise, that it seamed she had (the same daye) some fore knowleage of the commynge of hym, whome her beautye made prisoner, and her crueltye enioyned a moste harde and longe penance, for she had vp∣pon the vttermoste parte of her heade, a call or coronet of golde restynge vppon a wreath or garlande of flowers of sondrie coollors, pletted by curious sleighte of the fingers within her enameled haires, whiche couerynge one parte of her sholders, dispersed theym selues also some time vp∣pon her delicate forehead, and some tyme wafynge vn∣pon her roasye chéekes accordyng to to the mylde breathe of the euenynge winde whiche gaue theym mouynge, dis∣posed theym selues with suche seamelye grace, with in∣crease to the beautye of her that ware theym, that who had sene the porte and maiestie whiche nature ioyned to this rare worke, woulde haue iudged that loue and the three graces had, had no other place of harbor but in this pece of wonderful perfection. At either of her eares hong two faire and riche orient perles, whiche increased also the glée of her golden haires, besides the large & glistering forehead of this
Nymphe, whereupp on was sett a border of riche dyamondes founded vppon a frame of pure golde, castynge suche pearcynge glymers to the beholders, that it presented ra∣ther a ranke or order of shynynge starres, when the ela∣mente, in the heate of the sommer is moste cleare, expo∣synge beames of wonderful bryghtnes, then an attire of a mortall creature, whereuppon attended two sparklynge eyes assisted on eyther syde by an equall Simmetria or iuste proporcion with certeine knottes and borders of vaines of the coolor of azure, with a special vertue to drawe and mor∣tefie any harte made of the hardeste mettall that euer was, yeldynge so liberallie their seruent beames, that who so dis∣posed hym selfe to contemplacion of thies two twinklyng starres, was in no lesse daunger to loase the benefitt of hys sighte, then in tymes paste wée reade certeine Philosophers became blinde vppon the mounte Olympium with continual regarde of the sonne to iudge the dispacicion of the heauens: then appered her delicate nose, aunsweringe in proportion the reste of her face, deuidynge also her two chekes of the coollor of a fyne incarnatt, resemblynge two rounde aples come alredie to the fulues of their maturitie, nexte to the whyche succeded her courall mouthe, breathinge a perfume more precious and sweete, then any confection made of the Amber, muske, or other droge aromatike comynge oute of ARABIA, and if some tyme she chaunced to disclose and o∣pen her lippes, resemblyng in roundenes and collour two cheris in their full ripenes, excedyng also the softnes of any thinge that euer was accompted delicate or tender, there appered twoo rawes of perles of suche rare whitenes, that thorient I say complayneth of wante of connynge to make comparison with the coullor of her téethe, And so discen∣ding some what lower, this Dyana discouered a necke, whose complexion giueth cause of shame to the whitnes of the glo∣rius lillie, and makes blushe the pure allablaster, her sto∣make also somewhat raised by two rounde and precius dug∣bugges
of equall seperation, was couered with a braue and softe vaile, more tender then the thyn lawne, whyche hyn∣dred no waye the viewe of her trauellynge brestes, panting and drawinge a pleasante breathe accordyng to the motion of thaffection whyche gouerned thinner partes of ye though∣tes of this earthlie goddesse, who besydes all thys, was assi∣sted with a gyfte of suche naturall beautie, bestowinge courteise regardes vppon all men accordyng to their indif∣ferent meritt, that the same made her no less worthie to bee honored and serued of the greatest princes of the worlde, then the rarietie of her perfection restored her a merueile & wonder to all menne, whyche is a vertue farre from the moste parte of oure faire dames, who glorienge in the glee of their beautie) are moued I can not tell, with, what opinion of suche disdaine, with desier to appere more perfe∣cte then is necessarie, that in sekyng to sette a fairer enamel of that whyche nature hathe made sufficientlye precious, they do not only impaire the credit of renowme by suborned meanes of ymperfection of theym selues, but also by their owne follye deface the glorie of that, whyche sturreth vpp the chiefest cause of affection in men to do theym honor and seruice, wherein as my purposse is not to discouer the doin∣ges of any in such cases, so I hope this allegation of a troth in couarte manner, will defende me from the displeasures of suche as fynde theym selues infected with the humor of that follie, wherwith, in preferryng my integretie, I wishe theym all as worthie, as they are desierous to weare the badge of glorious beautie, and so to Dom Diego whome I thynke you will iudge hadde sufficient cause of astonishe∣ment, beynge so valyantlye assailed) without thynkynge of suche an assalte) wyth so stronge an armye, as the beautie behauiour, and princely shapp of this faire ympp and veraye nestcockle of nature, eye I thynke that the moste sparynge pilgrym that euer vndertoke to mortefye hys bodye with painefull trauell in deuocion to anye sainte▪ wolde haue re∣nounced his vowe, and caste a waye bothe skripp and staff,
to haue donne honour to so faire an obiecte as the beautie of this nymphe, and I doubte whether she moste assured and staide Philosopher of olde tyme wolde haue made any con∣science to forsake his profession of contemplacion of natu∣rall thinges, with iudgemente of thelamentes, to haue dis∣posed him selfe and skil to the seruice of so rare a perfection, I thynke also that if the doughter of Mynos hadd bene fauo∣red with semblable beautie, and blyssed with equall giftes and grace of this Ladie, that her Hipolites wolde haue lefte the shippe and dogges of Dyana to haue pursued the quest of so diuiue a misterye as appeared in all partes of this Geni∣uera Lablonde, who for her parte also was indifferently ama∣zed, and no lesse astonied with the porte and courtelike beha∣uiour of the knyghte, then he moued to scilence with the viewe of her beautie, wherewith also castynge vppon hym Geniuera fal leth in loue vvith Diego. certeyne regardes at vnwares, began to fele a motion of that wherein she hadd not bene earste experienced, with an alteration in her harte, whyche forced a chaunge of com∣plexion in her face, with a soddayne scilence for wante of audacitie to speake: an ordynarie custome to suche as bée strycken with the disease of loue, to loase the vse of the ounge, when it sholde chyefly ease the gréeff of the harte, who not hable to supporte the heauie burden of passions pro¦cedynge of that euill, dothe ymparte the greatest charge to the eyes, as to the faythful messengers of the secrett concep∣tions of the mynde, whyche passioned aboue his force, and pressed with thalarams of affection, is driuen for the moste parte to force a vente or yssue for the humour of hys desier by the same meane and ministers, whyche firste dis∣couered the rage of his feuer, whereof there seamed al∣redie a Sympathia or equalitie betwene the two younglin∣ges, beynge bothe indifferently ignorante of the misterie or cause of suche soddaine transmutacion, whyche also grewe to tearmes of aggrauacion in theym both, by a renouacion of their gretyngs and enterteinementes at their arriuall at
the castell, the same seruynge as freshe baytes to encrease their desier, hauynge notwithstandyng chiefeste power on the behalfe of the knighte, who losyng at this firste meting the liberty of his thoughtes, becam by litle & litle so rauissed of his sences, and drowned in the poysoned podle of loue, that he tooke no other pleasure then in the conceyte of the gracious martirdom he endured in the secrett ymaginacion of the beautie of his faire Geniuera: here you maye sée the knighte who in the mornyng was the mayster of hym self, and in full possession of his sences, is nowe so transformed into a contrary disposicion, that his willynge bondage and state of presente captiuitie, is not only more pleasante vn∣to hym, then the benefitt of his auncient lybertie deare, but also kepte hym so longe from the vse of his former fredome, that in the ende he tooke no felicitie yf not in wyshynge to enioye thother worlde, whyche for the moste parte are the frutes of this follie, who séelynge the sences of man, dothe driue hym head longe (with his eyes cloased) into the golphe Loue proce∣des of a fond opynion. of miserable dispaire: and as loue procedes no other wayes then of a fonde opynion, so the purgatory of suche as be af∣flicted therewith, comes only by a foolyshe perswacion, that they be forsaken or deceiued in the thing which they honor so much, wher, of the contrary parte, yf they wolde be indif∣ferente betwene their passion, and his vale we, they woulde not so rashelye make more accompte of the thynge whyche tormentes theym, then of their healthe, honour and life, ex∣posed al to the seruice and appetit of her, who, disdainyng pe∣raduenture their indeuor, retorne the méede of their me∣rit, vppon a straunger and yeldes the praye to an other, for the whyche he hathe taken suche paine, whereby he ta∣kes occasyon of absolute dispayre, delitynge in nothynge but the perentory ende of his vnhappie lyfe. whileste supper was makinge readie, the ladye mother dis∣patched certeine of her people to seke the seruantes of Dom Diego, whereof some had in charge to reaporte his beinge
there to his mother, who for her part was no lesse glad, then she had cause, chiefly for that the distresse of her son brought hym in the ende to so good an hostesse, as her neighbour, and only trende of the worlde, in which meane while the straun∣ger was desiered to supplie the best place at the table, ouer agaynste whom, was appointed the matche that firste set his harte on fyer, and in place to performe the exspectacion of his hostesse in tasting the sondrie delicate meates she had pre¦pared for hym, he fed only vpon the dishes of loue, and con∣tenting hymselfe with the dyot of his eyes, who wythout▪ ei∣ther let or Ielowsie, ymparted their norriture to the harte, roued now and then by secret glaunces and percing regards to the tender stomake of the faire Geniuera, who for her parte also was no nigarde to requite hym with treble vserye, of fa∣myliar glée, which restored suche fresh alarams to his late de¦sier, that thalteracions hee felte in hymselfe made hym blushe at his owne behauior, and as duringe the tyme of sup∣per he was indiffrently feasted with delicate brothes prepa∣red by the mother, and famyliar signes sente vnto hym by the eyes of her doughter, so he felt hymselfe doble passioned, both to conster the meaninge of suche regardes, and also to dym the sighte of tholde lady, for discerning the conueigh of their follie, wherein albeit aswell to caste a miste before the eyes of her mother, as to dissemble the desier of hys mynde, he bestowed his lookes vnconstantly here and there abowte all the partes of the table, yet colde he not vse suche sleighte in this simple shifte, but hys eyes toke alwayes their laste farewell vpon the place and person of hys mistres, in whom he founde so thankefull a reatorne, with amarus tribute, that in the ende he durst not beholde her any more, for feare her bewtie would bere aue hym of the benefit and sighte of his eyes, all which were but prepratiues to the part he had yet to playe, into the whiche he began to enter the same night, when after supper and the banquet performed, he had
giuen the Bonsoir to hys hostesse and her faire doughter, who for a more showe of hys welcome (or rather a declaracion of her zeale, but chiefly to leaue hym occasyon of further tor∣mente, would not departe his chamber till she sawe him in bedd, where in place of slepe, and to restore hys wearye body wyth the course of naturall rest, he began to sighe, and build castels in Spaine, preferringe in his mynde, thymages of a thousande fancies and follies, suche as are appointed to ap∣peare and torment them as haue their braine weakned with vaine cogitacions. Alas (saith he) is it possible that I whych so longe haue en∣ioyed the benefitt of a pleasante libertie, shold thus lightlye Dom diego passioned vvith loue. yelde to the firste sommance and apprehention of a seruile thraldom? which albeit I cannot expresse in propper tearmes yet my mynde feleth an experience and effecte of his force? is this the desert of my former fredom or iust hier of wāton inclynacion, yf such harde tribute attende myne aunciente quiet, what exspectaciō of other felicitie is ther in the course of our young yeres, then for a short time of flattering delites in libertie, to be rewarded in the ende with an interest of tre¦ble tormentes in bondage? haue I thus longe kept war with thennemye of my frée priueledge, and reserued the mayden∣head of my affection, to fall thus into the daunger of a cap∣tiuitie, wher I dowt no lesse whether my offer wylbe recei∣ned, thē dispair, to be intreated according to the iustice of my merit? Ah Geniuera, god forbid that thy bewtie haue power to send so many tormentes and punishmentes to my yelded hart, as the tre, wherupon thou takest thy name, hath prickes to anoye them that touche it, and bitter in disgestion to such as make a tast of the Iewse, Ah paragon and only praise of bewtie, sewerly the fearefull hare whych thy dogges tare in peces afore thy face this eueninge, was not more marti∣red by the bloudy Iawes of thy greyhoundes, then my harte is tormented and deuided into dyuersatie of opynions vp∣pon the affection whyche I beare the, wherein alas as I
knowe not whether thou wilt admit me worthy of they ser∣uice, or hast already paste a graunte of thy loue to an other, more worthye of fauor then the loyal Dom Diego, So yet I may be bolde to vaunte vpon thys ympossibilitie. that no mā is hable to approche thunfayned sinceritye of my harte, de∣termyned rather to geue place to the sentence of my deathe, then to dysmysse the leaste part of the dutie I haue vowed to thy bewtie, whole outwarde showe promiseth an inwarde vertue, that I cannot dispaire to possesse in the ende the due méede of my loyaltie, til whych tyme I wyll praye onlye vp∣pon the foode of exspectacion, wyth assured intente, for my parte, not onlye to abandon all other ympressions or de∣siers, but such as shall seame to fauor the honor and seruyce I haue already sworne, but also to endeuor by extreme di∣ligence to make my selfe worthye of the goodwill of the fai∣rest Lady (that thys daye is shrewded) vnder the globe or cir∣cuit of heauen: wherwyth after he had consumed certeine ho wers in reauyng and raginge vppon hys amarus complot, and that he had sufficiently swete at the browes wyth the force and vehemencye of his passion, he founde the chiefeste medecyn for moderacion of hys gréefe, to communicate vn∣to her the pointes of hys good wyll, wyth desyer he had not only to serue her, but also from henseforth to accept in good part such sentence, as she shall thinke good to pronounce of hys life or deathe, and to do nor say any thyng, but suche as shalbe awarded him by the dome of the faire Geniuera, who for her parte also was not voyde of passion nor dispensed from semblable tormente, for offring to performe the ceremonies of the night, she was demed to close her eyes & yet knewe not Slepe the ce∣remonies of the night. the cause that hindred the course of slepe, by which meanes, making a laborinth of her riche and faire feldbed, she was no less assailed with contrariety of conceites, then her languis∣hing seruant, wherfore finding the burdē of affectiō to excede the grenes of her yeres, not yet assisted wt any discrecion or experiēce in loue, dytermined to allow the resolucion of the knight, if he ymparted the same either by subtil signes or
secret conference. This was thexercise of that nighte of bothe the louers e∣quall in desier, and yet the one ignorant of the others greffe, wastinge indifferently in sighes and wishes, as apprentises of the thinge, wherin those that begyn be alwayes most hoat, and such as contynue gaine skill by longe practise, and yet the best experienced of al, are voyde of resistance against such an euill, and lacke gouernement in the conueigh of so hurt∣full a case. The morninge had no soner discouered her glorious bea∣mes, and the messēger of the son somoned the loathsom night to retire, but the weary knight left his restles bedd, with in∣tent to take leaue of his hostesse, and chalenge the skoape of the larg feldes, to record & enterteine hys amarus thoughts, in retorning to hys mothers house, wherin notwithstanding he founde a staie of his meaning by the honest ymportunitie of tholde lady, who with more intreatie then was nedefull to so willyng a gueste, won hym easely to determyn hys ta∣ryenge till dynner, till whyche tyme, he founde a supplye of exercise wyth her companie, and conference of her daugh∣ter, in whom he saw contynual cause to aggrauat his affec∣tion, and doble occasion to encrease hys desier, in such sorte, as his astonyed countenance, and broken aunsweres, ympor¦ting most oftē the cōtrary of their demaunds, showed suffici∣ently ye troble & war in his mind, which albeit ye subtil Geniue∣ra, cōstrued according to a troth, yet her simple mother impu¦ted it to an honest shame & want of audacitie in ye gentlemā, for yt he had not much haunted ye cōpany of ladyes, wherin as they spente the most part of the morning, without (notwith¦stāding) that Dom Diego, had the hart to discouer the leaste part of his promise of ye night, so yt hower of dinner sōmoned them to breake their discourse & performe ye due to thappetit of nature, wyth suche delicate & sumpteouse fare as the good lady had prouided, in declaracion of ye hartie zeale she bare to her guest, who after dinner failed not in humble sorte to be thankfull to his hostes, with assuraunce that, albeit he was
not hable to requite her curtesse with equall consideracion, yet his goodwill at all tymes sholde be nothinge inferior to the greatnes of her merit, wherewith he addressed the rest of hys dutie to her daughter, whose bewtie (as you sée) had made so great a wound in hys harte, that the remembrance remayned till the last hower of hys lyfe, and as he kissed her hande with intente to decipher that whych he had ymagined all the night, he became so amazed wyth thympedimente he felte in his tongue, with straunge diuersatie in all hys sen∣ces, that he seamed no lesse ashamed of his present weaknes in that place, then afore he was fullie resolued to discharge there solucion and meaninge of hys hart, whych albeit gaue some cause of litle astonishment to the younge Lady, yet she founde indifferente occasion of pleasure and pitie in hys pas∣sion, for that as ye one proceded by her meanes, so she felt a mo¦tion in conscience to expose the other for the relefe of hym who suffred for her sake, wherefore with a trobled regarde tempered with sufficiente argumentes of affection on her behalf, she brake his dome traunce with these words, I wish sir (sayth she) that you might fynde asmuch pleasure in your passion, as the same hath ymparted equall gréefe to others, and that your future absence may pinche you with no lesse annoye, then your present departure leaueth me desyerus to enioye a longer tyme of your presence, whyche philosophye not loked for of the knight, did not only dismysse his scilence and vntye the charme of hys tongue, but also renforced hym to an audacitie to yelde her thankes for the compassion she vsed to hys distres, with addicion that onely he was hap∣pie aboue all the worlde, to be partaker of so liberal a wishe, but chiefly to heare her in tearmes of desier touchinge hys presence, whych wyth hys lyfe and al that he had he bound ther by othe, to be preste at all howers to performe the recu∣cion of her commaundemente, wherunto she replied with thankes according to the affection that gouerned her, with request eftsones (and that wyth a reciprocal looke and soft sighe) not to forget hereafter the waye to the castell of her
mother, to whom (she assured hym) the welcomest gueste of the worlde, and for her parte, she accompted it a felicitye to participate in her pleasure, and kepe in entier the league of frendshipp, where with heretofore bothe their houses haue ben blissed from the beginninge, where with time, with the nomber of assistantes, witnessing their glee, forced an abrid∣gement of their farewel, contrarie albeit to both their wills, the one retirynge to her chamber, with more care and lesse quiet then afore, and the other, with a thousand hamours in his head, tooke his waye to the house of his mother, to whom he ymparted his aduenture, his distres, beinge lefte of hys men in a place vnknowē, his horse ouercome with èxtreme trauel, and that which worste was, thapproche of night, and his dispaire to fynde harbor, when not withstādyng he chan∣ced vppon the castell of the olde Ladye, of whose curtesie & beautye of her doughter he made a perticular discourse, lea∣uynge oute notwitstandynge, the glée betwene Geniuerae and hym, wyth requeste that it woulde please her, to ioyne with hym in some honeste meane of thankefull considera∣tion to theim bothe, whereunto he founde his mother no lesse readie in consente, then hym selfe desyerous to vse ex∣pedicion in theffecte, so that wyth her aduise, the platt was made to inuite theym to her house the weke followynge, and that he alone shoulde worke theffect, like as he founde hymselfe moste charged with the dett of their curtesie, and desyer to requite it, whereunto he added suche diligence, that vppon his letter and humble requeste, he gott the con∣sente of the mother and doughter, whiche both failed not of their promiss at the daye appointed. When Dom Diego (hauinge for the nonste the assistaunce of all the gentlemen and gentlewomen his neghbours) for∣gatt Geniuera and her mother, at the house of Diego. no pointe of his indeuor to do them al ye honor he could, both in sumptuousnes of dyot, wherof there was more then sufficient, choice of musicke & melodie of all sortes, masques momries, triumphes & other offices of humanitie, wherein it behoued hym chieflye to show a singler deleritie, aswell
for the discarg of euery mans eye and exspectatiō, touching a showe of his giftes, beinge norrished and broughte, vpp a∣mongste princes, and also for the desyer he had to leaue no honor vnperformed in the companie of her, who had already the whole possession of his libertie. I nede not discriue by pece meale thapparell of the feaste, the diuersitye and chaunge of theyr dyot, theyr delicate ban∣quetes, nor the sondrye sortes of swete wynes, it maye suffice, that after dynner they discended into a greate hall, readye trymmed for the purpose, where the daunces began accordyng to the stroke of a swete and softe musike, shrow∣ded vnder a vaile or canapie of arrais in the vppermoste parte of the hall, there euerye gentleman toke his Ladye, amongeste whome Dom Diego was not forgetfull to addresse him towardes his mistres, no lesse gladd of her happie en∣counter, then he contente to be so neare the cause of his pleasante tormente and insupportable passion of mynde, whereof he began euen nowe to make some discouerye by wordes in this sorte. Like as (good madam) I haue al∣wayes Diego vvoeth Geniuera in a daunse. thoughte that musicke hath imported a secrett ver∣tue, to force an apparance of ioye, in the moste pynynge and solytary disposicion that is, Euenso I fynde myne opi∣nion confirmed by a presente experience in my selfe, who earste languishinge in panges of inwarde gréeff, with de∣testation not onelye againste my selfe, but also all other thinges that offred any waye to ease the greatnes of myne anoye, do fele nowe some moderation of my martirdom, as∣wel by the lamētable note of theis recordes & insensible in∣strumēts, agreing with the sorowful condiciō of my present distresse, as also, that by their conformitie & meanes, I finde my selfe neare vnto her▪ who only hath power to cleare the clowdes of my mortal euil, & restore me to the calme of min auncient quiet and as diuerse diseases are not cured but by a medicen and obiecte of their first occasion, so for my parte, beinge contributor to the daunger of that extremitie, I ac∣compte you as iustely bounde to yelde me compassion, as
your beauty is the chief and vndowted cause of thalteration which I can no longer coceile from you and which forceth me in thies few wordes, to vowe vnto you (without condi∣cion of dissolution) suche assurance of my seruice, that only death shal haue cōmission to corupte ye league which I seale here on your behalfe, by the faith & life of a knight, to be the only seruante, loyal frende, (and yf you accepte thoffer) the lawful husband of ye faire Geniuera La blonde: who for her part felte her selfe so assailed with the motions of affection, that she coulde not contynue so assured in her countenance, but there appered chaung of coulour, arguynge indifferently a contentement of the offer, and a pleasante mislike of his re∣queste, which rather gaue hym corage to pursue the points of his purposse, then disiste or disclayme the hope of so good a begynnynge, wherein as he forgat not to vse thoffice of a good solicitor for hym selfe all that after dynner, so his ym∣portunitie at laste, broughte her to passe a consente, and confirme the bale vnder thies tearmes: I am ignorante ir Geniuera aū svvereth vvith half consent to his request (sayeth she) in the misterie of your disease, and muche lesse a I preauie to thoccasion, which bothe I hope, will defende me from ymputacion of blame in with holdyng the remedie you craue at my hande, only I can not but greue in the euil of hym, to whom, if the whole companie are iustlye bounde to be thankeful for the frendshypp they fynde, I haue cause of doble obligation, possessynge by your presence, the one∣lye contentemente I wyshe in this worlde, neyther is your affliction partiall on youre hehalfe, considerynge I am also plunged in panges of equal effect, finding now (I must confesse vnto you) that as it is veray harde to conceile the Yt is hard to conceile the passion of loue. passion procedyng of loue, So albeit I hadd determined yet to dissymule that whiche I féele, yet am I forced from that resolution by a suggestion sturrynge in the secrett of my hart which I can not tearme properly other wayes then a seconde inspiration, assailynge me with an ympression, whereof I am indyfferentlye ignorante bothe for skyll
and iudgemente, notwithstandynge reaposynge muche for my selfe in your vertue, which moueth me also to a remorse to satisfie in some parte the due of your deserte, I am con∣tente to admitt your offer of a loyall frend, till you haue ob∣teyned of my mother the seconde pointe, confirmyng thut∣termoste of your demaunde, till then, contente your selfe Mariage. with my iuste delaye, and procure the supplie of your desier with thexpedicion of your owne diligence, whyche laste woordes sturred vpp suche presente ioye in the passioned knighte, that what betwene the waues of sodaine gladnes ouerflowinge all his partes, and hope of spedie redresse by the consent of her mother, he was skarce hable to pronounce a symple thankes, Albeyt kissynge her white and delicate hande, in witnesse of the syngler pleasure he felte in the breath of her wordes, tolde her, that, as her beautie and ver∣tue deserued honor of the greateste prince in Spaine, so for his parte, he onely mighte glorie in the seruice of the mosts faire, courteyse and honest Ladie, that euer was bredd on that syde the mountes, wherewith he was driuen to cutt of his further discourse, by the approche of the messenger whi∣che was sente from the two Ladie mothers, to will theym to comme to supper, where yfthere were any wante of cu∣rious deuyse at dynner, it was supplyed with a double ex∣cesse at this supper, beynge serued with suche chaunge and choice of straunge dyott, that if it be not syn to compare tha∣buses mortal, with diuine misteries, I thinke Iupiter and the other goddes were not so plentifullie intreated vppon the mounte Peleon celebratynge the mariage of the faire Thetis: albeit the ende of the banquett concluded with a resolution to renewe thexercise of after dynner vppon a faire grene, enuironed with diuers borders and oderiferous hearbes and ympes of the earthe, pauished aboue by artificiall sleyghte, with certeine laurell braunches and buddes of hathorne, to defende theym frome the parchynge heate of the sonne, where they hadde also to assyste their pleasaunte recrea∣tions, the moste temperatt season of the daye at the de∣declynyng
of the sonne, the pleasante huishyng of a cleare streame discendynge frome the toppe of a mountayne, the chirpyn hermonye of the féelden birdes, assembled (as it were onelye to increase their solace) and also the softe and swéete accorde of the grene bowes or young spra∣yes, mouinge at the whistle of the milde ZEPHIR, where as they deuided theym selues into diuerse chaunge of pa∣stimes, some to weaue garlandes of flowers for their ser∣uantes, some to ronne and leape, or expose other exploites of actiuitie for the honour of his mistres, and other to trye the maystery of mayne force by casting the sledge or heauie barr, So amongest theym all there was one Dom Roderyco a neare neyghbour and moste famylar to thamarus Diego, who perceiuing by the secrett messengers of the eye, whiche passed betwene hym and hys mistres by stelthe, to what sainte he wolde gladly offer his candell, and how desirous shée was to admitt hys deuocion: furthered thintentes of theym bothe so farfurthe, that he toke by the hande a young gentlewoman sittinge nexte to the faire Geniuera to begyn a newe daunce, whereunto as she was nothyng vnwilling, so Dom Diego tooke corage also to addresse hym selfe to hys mistres, whose example the whole trowpe of nobilitie fol∣lowed with indifferente contentacion, and for the more ho∣nour of the daunce Seigneur Roderico, who was the firste in the round, gaue charge offcilence to the musicions, hauing conferred affore with his gentlewoman to synge some so∣lemne note vppon the subiecte of the two amarus, wherein she performed so indifferently the praise & passion of theym bothe, that a man woulde haue iudged she hadd entred into the harte of Dom Diego and bene specially instructed of the faire Geniuera, who seyng her self touched at the quicke and pinched without laughinge in the hearinge of so manie, but chiefly exalted to the skyes in the presence of hym who tooke no lesse pleasure in her praises, then if he hadd bene presen∣ted with the Seigneury of all Aragon, colde not so connynglie dissemble her contentement, but thalteracion of her mynde
appered in the often chaunge of complexion in her face, which as it increased the cristal die & excellencie of her beau∣tie, So Dom Diego construyng that passion to his cōmoditie, gaue iudgement of thassurance of her good wil, wherof for a further prooff be wrōg her tender fyngers, & with a smy∣lyng regarde, askinge her opynion of the songe, wished that her seruante mighte liue to sée thaccomplishment of suche a prophecie, protesting withal, that in his life he had not hard Musicke of more delite, for the which (sayeth he) I acknow∣ledge a dett to the gentlewoman, that so aptly hath discoue∣red your good will towardes me, and vowed so frankelie on your behalfe, my loyall seruice, which I will not forgett to confirme in all that I maye, euen vntill the last dropp of my bloud, whereunto Geniuera replied with a doble vsury of hū∣ble thankes, with requeste that he would reapose vndouted creditt in the mistery of the songe, whiche as it had rightlye deciphered the determynation of her mynde, and vnfolded that whyche she reserued onely as secrett in her selfe, so she wold not for her part, forget to performe theffect, when con∣uenient time, with her mothers consente, wold admitt the lawful consummacion, vppon which laste wordes attended suche frendlie glaunces and wanton regardes of the eye, wt a coūterchaunge of semblable glée on his parte, that the two Ladie widowes, did not onely note their affections, but also giue iudgemēt of the conclucion & vnitie of their myndes, wt resolution (for their parts) to confirme the bargaine, with thassistāce of time, vsing as then but only a simple cōference deferring the finall effect by reason of the tender yeares and grene youth of bothe the louers, whome if the discretion of the mothers at that instante, hadd conioyned by the othe of mariage, they hadd preuented the malice of an vnconstant fortune, who in all delayes forgettes not to playe the ordy∣nary rolet of her natural mobility, wherof she exposed a ma∣nifest effecte in ye persons of thies two auncient widdowes, one hauing lost her son for twenty or xxij. moneths without hope ettesones to recouer his presence, by a crueltie & rashe
conceite of the doughter of the other, who (without the spe∣ciall prouidence of God) hadd gyuen suche a false bounde to her honour, that the simple remembrance was sufficient to dispatche the olde yeares of her mother with an vntymely sommonee to discende to her fatall graue. And now during this amarous practise betwene thyes two prentises in loue, whose affectiō growing to a feruentnes wt an indifferent desier in theim both, presented argumētes of equall alteration in the personnes of the one & the other, for Dom Diego retiring by litle & litle from the liuely hew of his former cōplexion, seamed transformed in amoment, neither did he allow any pleasure, but that which he possessed by the presēce of his Geniuera, who also for her part, iudged ye whole felicitie of the earth to consiste in the parson of her seruant, whom she accompted the only patterne for perfection, of all the gentlemen of his time, neither did he let slip any weke, wherein he went not to do his dutye to his mistres thrée or foure times, in whom he foundè a reatorne of his curtesie, with such vertuouse & honest consideration as was conue∣nient in a maide carefull of the garde of her honor, wherein albeit her mother, reaposyng indifferent credit in the ver∣tue of theym both, gaue leaue to her doughter to kepe hym companie, yet (as Aristotle affirmeth) honesty doth not broke longe dalliance, or wanton chatt in chast maydes wt the first that accoasteth theim wt conferēce in corners with any but suche as by consente of the church haue gott the power and possession of their bodie and is or oughte to be the one halfe or moytie of their mynde, whiche albeit was thintente and desier of theis two louers, yet ye simplicitie of their frendes, deferring theffect, wrought not only a breach of ye bargain, but also sturred vp in her, an humor of mortal spite against the sinceritie of her loyal seruāt; who endewred ye reuēge of her vniust anger, vnder a punishmēt of a most sharp & long penance in deserts inhabitable & vnknowē, for in ye heate of this reciprocal loue betwene thies younglings, it chaūced yt a meruellous faire and goodly gentle woman, doughter of a
greate lorde of the countrey called Forrando de la Sara, vsyng familiarly the companie of Geniuera, becam by that meanes extremely in loue with Dom Diego, assayinge by publike and priuate meanes to imparte vnto hym what power and au∣thoritye she woulde willingly giue hym ouer her harte, yf for his part, he would requite the sinceritie of her loue with semblable honor and affection, wherein experiencynge the benefytt of all honest meanes seamyng any waye to fauour the effecte of her desyer, considered at last, that, aboue all o∣ther exercises, the knight tooke greatest pleasure in hawkes, wherfore vnder coulor to make a breache into his fauour with assistyng the disposition of his delite, she sente him one daye a tassell gentle) as the chiefeste Iewell she had to pre∣sente hym withall, excepte the offer of her owne good wyl, wherein Dom Diego albeit he was wholly possessed by an o∣ther, and with the losse of his libertie, hadd also so departed wit his iudgement, that he could not discerne thintente and honest zeale of the gentlewoman, yet he accepted her pre∣sente and retorned the messenger with suche thankes as ap∣pertayned. In the receiuing of this hawke, appeared absolute showes of the euill fortune of the pore Diego, which immediatly fayled not to thunder vppon hym without cōpassion, for as he went often to visitt his mystres, so he forgott not continually to cary this hawke vppon his fiste, boastinge so farr vppon the goodnes of the birde, that he chaunced in her presence to saye that it was one of the thinges in the worlde he helde moste deare. Sewerly this wordes were sifted more nerely then there was cause, and construed to other end, then he mente them, seinge that certeine dayes after in his absence, deuising vp∣pon his sondry vertues, some commended his honeste and curteus behauior, some gaue praise to his valyauntnes and dexteritie in armes, some exalted in him the sondrye giftes of nature, and passing further, he was generallye preferred of all the companie for his sinceritie and constant dealynge
in matters of loue; sauing of one Graciano, who rather en∣uyinge the vertue of the knight by malice, then hable to de∣face ye leaste of his gyftes by reason, ioyned with the reste in commendacion of his personage, actiuitie and other dowries of nature, but for his faith or care of promiss where loyaltye shoulde moste appere, I accompte hym (sayeth he) so apte to dissemble, and inconstante by nature, that he vseth no dif∣ference of personnes in grounding his affections, makynge no conscience to seame to languishe mortallye, where he meaneth nothing lesse then firme constancie, which touched Geniuera so neare, that she coulde not giue place any longer to the sinister bable of Graciano, desieringe hym to vse other tearmes touchinge the honestie of Dom Diego, for (saith she) I am of opinion that he will rather passe vnder the sentence of any death, then forfeyt the leaste pointe of his promise passed alreadie vnder the seale of his faith to a gentlewoman of this contrey, besides his loue (I knowe is so sincere and vpright) that I dare pawne my lif on ye behalf of thassurāce. There is the miste that dimmeth your eyes, sayeth this cankarde ennemye of Diego, for vnder the vaile of a periu∣red loyaltie, he abuseth the simplicitie of honeste Ladyes, whereof I nede not go farr for a prooff, nor you doubt much of the misterye, if you conferr the circumstāce of his former profession towardes you, with the presente▪ league of frende shipp betwene him and the doughter of Dom ferrando de la Sara, cōfirmed alredye by the gyfte of a tassell gentle, which for her sake he estemeth aboue all the thinges in the world, which last allegatiō restoring a remembrance of the words, pronounced not longe ago by the knight touching the deare accompte he made of his hawke, began to brede a suspicion of his constancie, and an assured creditt in the information Geniuera fal∣leth ī disdain vvith Diego. of thunhappie Graciano, wherein swelling immediatly with her vniust collor incensed by a simple & cold Ielowsie, was forced to abandon the place, & retire into her chamber, wher she gaue suche skoape to her synister conceite, that she was vpon tearmes manye times to vse force againste her selfe,
whereunto she had added present dispatche, if a hope to pro∣cure in time the reuenge of the wronge, whiche she perswa∣ded to haue receiued of her Diego, had not staide thexecution, albeit she coulde not so gouerne her malicious disposition, but the deadly hate conceiued in this moment against thin∣nocente gentleman, did not onely supplante both stocke and roote of aunciente zeale on her parte, but also grewe to suche mortalitie in her venemous stomake, that she seamed not to delite so muche in the vse of her owne life, as in de∣syer to take pleasure in the remembrance of the death of hym, who no lesse innocent in the cause, then ignorante of the grudge, came the nexte mornynge (as he was wonte) to sée her, hauing vppon his fiste (by euill fortune) the birde which bredd firste this mortall Ielowzye: And as he satt de∣uisyng with her mother, fyndinge a wante of thaccustomed companie of his mistres, he asked where she was, whereun∣to he was aunswered by one of her women, that assone as she sawe hym enter the house, she tooke her chamber, all whiche he dissimuled by his wisdom, imagininge the same to procede of some wanton fancie or coye conceite, whereunto the most part of women are cōmonly incident, so that when he sawe his time, he tooke leaue of her mother & departed, me∣ting by chaunce as he wente downe the steares of the hall, one of the chambrieres or Gentlewomen of Geniuera, whō he requested to kisse the hande of his mistres on his behalfe, whiche she promised to performe, hopinge to do a thinge no lesse acceptable to her mistres, then to gaine thankes of him on whose behalfe she presented the curtesie. Albeit, as it is to be thoughte that Geniuera enioyed litle quiet and lesse contentemente in this meane while, solici∣ted, I can not tell, by what desyer to defye whollye the re∣membrance of Diego, wherein she was the rather forthered by an information, that he bare still the tarssell of hys fyste, whyche she iudged to be done onely in despite of her, So when her woman offred to presente thimbassage of the knighte, she fell into suche tearmes of frenzie, that the
simple brute or name of Dom Diego sturred vp such hainous alterations within her, that to her former wroth, was added a present wodnes, in such sorte, that she seamed for the tyme to labor indifferently betwene thextreme panges of death, and vse of longer lif, albeit restored at laste by the greate di∣ligence of her woman, she coulde not so wholly dismisse her furie, but she imparted the passion of her anger to her eyes, who after they had some what eased her inwarde greef by a nomber of dollorous teares, put her etesones in the pos∣session of her former speache, whiche she witnessed in theis exclamations. Geniuera ex∣claimeth a∣gainst Diego. Ah traitor and disloyall knighte, vnworthie euery waye to participat with the breathe of the common ayre, and no lesse meritorious of the honor or bare title of knighthodde: hath the cōstant & honest loue I haue borne the, deserued this vn∣honeste recompense? is it a vertue to pretende loyaltye vn∣der a masqued vyserne of detestable deceite? if theis be the frutes of thy fayth, purifyed thorowe so many othes? what exspectatiō of assurance is there in the promisse of any man? Is it I that must fele the stynge of thy infectiō? What cause haue I giuen the to imagin the spoile of mine honor, and imparte the praye to an other vnworthie euery waye of iust comparison to me? Yf not in louynge the more then was conuenient to thy inconstante and dissemblinge disposition, I haue embased mine honor to aduaunce thy renowme, howe couldest thou without blushing attempte the offer of my good will, hauing thy conscience poysened wyth so many spotes of abhominable traison? howe dareste thow presente me the baise les ains by the mouth of a messenger, seinge thy whole bodye is alredie vowed to the seruice of an other? no, no, seinge God hath reueiled the vnto me afore thy vil∣lanye put effecte to the ruine of mine honor, I doubte not only to defende me hereafter from the force of thy deceitfull charmes, but also sweare vnto the by the eternall maiestie of the higheste, that albeit force makes me the treasores of thye wickednes, yet assure thy selfe from hensfurth at my
handes of such fauor, as thou maist exspect of the most mor∣tall enemy thou hast in the world, wherwith to giue the last farewel to the pore Diego, she writ ymediatly certeine lynes and deliuered theym sealed to her page, with commissyon, that the nexte daye hee shoulde méete the knyghte on the waye commynge thether, and delyuer the letter, wyth Instruction besydes, that affore hee came to the house, hee shoulde reade the contentes and performe the effecte, whereof the page (beinge made to the string) fayled not of any point, for the next day hée met Dom Diego, a quarter of a league frome the house, presentynge hym the letter wyth hys commission by mouth, who kissinge the pa∣per of his mistres in honor of her that sent it, opened the pac¦ket and founde that whych foloweth. Albeit the coutynuall complaynt of my gréeffe ymportes no dispence of my dollor, yet in exclayming against the wrōg Geniuera re¦procheth Diego by a letter. thou haste don me, I shal so desypher thy villanye, that the whole world shall fynde cause, not onely to proclayme open shame vpon the, but also (by my misfortune) beware of thin fections of thy detestable traison, whereunto if I haue added more credit then ther was cause on thy side, the remēbrāce of that whyche is past, (preferring a contynuall view of thy periured trothe) is to defende mée hereafter from the offer of semblable perill, neyther wyll I liue hensfurthe in feare of future euyl, or stand in awe eftsones to be infected by the, for that I haue not onely banished the remembraunce of Diego oute of euery corner of my mynde, but also am of in∣tente to performe such vengance and punishmente of my selfe, that if I fele any vaine, member or other parte in me, bente neuer so little to fauor the or sewe for grace on thy be halfe, to vse no lesse crueltie in tearinge the same from the reste, then thy disloyaltie hath sturred vp suche iuste cause of vnsemely tyranny in me. And for thy parte (O periured knight) sith it is thy only trade to beate euery bushe where thou thinkeste to bée eyther birde or neste, goo pitche thy
nettes where thou art sewer of praye, and baite thy hookes with tearmes of deceite to entrapp her, whose late presente is of more force wyth the, then the honeste and chaste loue which vertue began in vs both, for seing abirde hath made yt more lighte then the winde that supportes her in the ayre, God forbid that Geniuera, eyther admit thy excuses or allowe thy iustifycacion, and muche lesse wishe the other good, then to sée the torne in peces; wyth the moste extreme tormentes that euer martired any traitor, whych is the laste fauor thou hast to hope for of me, who lyueth not but to worke the spite aboue any enemye thou hast in the world. Geniuera la blonde He had no soner redd these sorowfull newes, but liftynge hys eyes to heauen he called God to witnes of hys innocen∣cye, who onely beyng priuye to thynteggretie of hys mind, colde also iustefye hys loyall meanynge towardes her who vniustly abused the sincere vertue of hys vnmouable affecti¦on, and as he ment ther to prefer some discoursen hys pur∣gacion, the page, who was not so amplie instructed of hys mistres, as mortall enemye to Dom Diego, staide thintente of hys meaninge by the reaporte of that whyche he hadde in charge by mouth, saying that he colde do no greater pleasure to Geniuera, then to shon all places of her repaire, seing (saith he) that as the frendshipp you haue vowed to the doughter of the Lord Sero, hath discouered your vntroth towardes her So she hath geuen iudgement agaynst youre vertue for fe∣dyng two simple gentlewomen indifferently with the foode of one vncerteine hope, wherewith he departed leauinge the knight in lesse care thenne affore, for that conferringe her grudge with the cause, he thought the small occasion foun∣ded also vpon an vntrothe, wold in shorte tyme take awaye the force of her collor, albeit hee colde not so whollie dis∣misse the remembrance of her displeasure, nor gouerne his owne passion, but retorning to his castell aboue an ordyna∣ry pase, went to hys chamber, wher pulling the poore hawke
from the pearche, committed her presentlye to a thousande morsels, and cursing her that sent her, wyth his owne follie in receiuing so vile a thinge (enchaunted as he thought, by some furye or magicall charme) determyned ymediatlye to presente hys mistres with the sacrafize of thoccasion of her vniust anger, with intente to performe nolesse of his owne bodie, if she wold not giue place to her displeasure vpon his honest purgacion, which wyth the dead hawke he sente by a trustie seruante of hys, debated at large in a letter, wherein after a nomber of iuste reasons to confute her vniust obiecti∣ons, touchinge lightly her rashe iudgement in guyng sen∣tence of hys vntrothe, without hearinge his iustifycation he preferred certeine humble meanes for moderacion of her displeasure, onelesse she reaposed felicitie to sée hym con∣sumed in the martirdom of apyning life, or dilited in the ne¦wes of hys present death, wt other instructōs which he gaue the messenger but chiefly to note the contenance of hys mis∣tres, and make faithfull reaport of euery pointe of her aun∣swere, wherwith the messinger posteth to Geniuera, to whom with al humylitie he presenteth the charge of his cōmission, albeit the passion of her fretting anger denied her pacience to reade the letter, and much lesse wold giue her leaue to ac∣cept the present, thunfayned witnes of the contrarie of that whych she to lightly beleued, but charged the messenger vp∣pon great paine to retorne with the tromperies he hadde brought, and say vnto his maister, that she knew to well his whistle to come at his call, and being lately burned, she wold take heede eftsones to fall into the fyer, wherwyth albeit the seruant went abowte to prefer thexcuse of hys mayster, yet the disdaynefull lady chokinge hys honest intent, forced him to vnwilling scilence, with charge to ympart her resolu∣cion to hys mayster, whom (sayth she) if I loued earst entyer lye, I hate nowe wyth a malyce more thenne mortal, wher wyth shée flonge out of the presence of the messenger, lea∣uynge hym no lesse amased at her crueltie, then dowtefull
to retorne to hys infortunate mayster, whom hee knewe wold skarcely be kept from the daunger of dispaire in hea∣ringe the sorowfull sommonce of his mistres: Albeit seinge he had professed to make a faythfull reaporte, hee retorned not forgetting to repete euery point of that, whyche she had giuen hym in charge, and withall restored the letter and deade presente vnto the selly Diego, who at the same instant, had giuen lyke ende to his euill and lyfe, if hys man had not withstanded thexecucion of hys morderinge handes, al∣beit hée colde not giue suche ympedymente to the furye of hys passion, but that it kepte hym occupyed wythe hideus groanes, and dolefull regardes the moste parte of the af∣ter none, till at laste hée quallifyed thextremetye of thys furye in complaynynge to hym selfe in thys sorte Alas (saythe hee) what iudgemente of fortune is thys, The cōplaint of Diego. that beinge at the pointe to reape the frutes of the contente mente I wishe in the world, and fede of the only felycitie I haue in this life, to be presented with an extremitie of more desperation then euer happened to any that bare the name of infortunat? If such iniquitie beare a swaighe in payinge the due hier of the honeste seruice of men, what hope here∣after may sustaine the lyfe of faythful louers? what exspecta¦cion haue they in the ende of their trauaile, when a Ielous enuye hath power not only to take the praie oute of their handes, but also ymparte the frute of their hope to an other, not worthy any waye to participate wt so glorious a merit. Ah Geniuera, if thy disdaynefull anger woulde giue the leaue to make a viewe of my innocencie, consider indiffe∣rentely the circumstāce of my former loue, wt ymagynaciō what assurance I haue hereafter vowed on thy behalfe, so long as my body beares lif in this earthly corruptiō, I know thou woldest repeale the sentence of thy former iudgement, correcte the sinister instincte that sturred vpp the humor of thy crueltie, and wype awaye at laste the teares of my vndeserued sorowe, wyth a franke offer of that whyche
I haue deserued by iustice. Ah vaine hope whyche hetherto haste flattered me wyth pilles of ioyfull disgestion, leauing me in the ende to the mercye of a miserable dispaire? is it I that muste fele thope∣racion of thy poyson, and liccour of bitter taste? it hadde bene better for me to haue bene repulsed in the begynninge, then after a pleasaunt profe of reciprocall loue, to be refused, and lose the earnest of my desyer, for so small an occasion, yt the only remembraunce makes me blushe at the symplicitye of the cause, Albeit fortune shal not altogether tryumphe ouer me, for so longe as I liue, so longe wyll I kepe my vowe to the faire Geniuera, and preserue my life onlye to witnes the constante force of my loue, which albeit I can not performe with out an extreme torment in skorchinge flames of con∣tynuall passion, yet the remembrance of my dutie to her to whom I offer this deuocion of a burninge sacrafyce of my selfe, wyll quallefye in some parte the heat of my skaldynge, gréeffe: wherewith he retired into suche sighes and signes of lamentable dollor, showinge hym indifferently plunged be∣twene the Alarams of death, and panges of frenzie, that hys man was at point to ronn for the old lady, to come and blisse her son wyth her last farewell, Albeit restoring hys traunce by his owne diligence, began (so far as he durst) to reprehend the weaknes of hys mynde, for that he seamed so careles of hym selfe, as to offer his life at the sommonce of a folyshe girle, who (sayth he) vseth thys cruell pollecie peraduenture, to make a tryall of your constancie, neyther ought you to do such wronge to your vertue, and much lesse kepe war wyth extremities, but if you be resolued to loue her, you must al∣so determyn to pursewe her by other meanes, and giuinge a lytle place to the malice of fortune, attende the benefit of a better tyme, who is neuer vnthankfull to theym that suffer her with pacience, and who also hath power to mollefye for you thys Dyamantyn harte of your mistres, albeit it be tem∣pred wyth the mettell and bloud of the most furious and sa∣uage beastes that euer bredd in the desertes of Lybya.
Diego did not only allowe thadmonicion of his man, but also felte cause of comforte in his aduise, with intente to per∣siste in the pursewte of the good will of his misters, to whō he preferred sondrie letters, ambassages by mouthe, & other excuses, wherin he gayned asmuche as in the firste, for that the more he courted her with honeste importunityes, the greater grewe her vniuste displeasure, in suche sorte, that in the end, she threatned the messenger with seuere punishe∣ment, if he continued anye longer the queste of his maisters follye, for (saith she) theis handes shall rather giue ende to my life by a willyng force againste my selfe, then my harte consente to be thankefull in anye sorte to hym, whome I hate no lesse then the stinge of a venemous serpente, which as it brought a fresh supplie of dollor to the languishynge Diego tryeng to thuttermost the vertue of his patience, so consideringe the litle gaine he sholde gett in attendynge that whiche his destynies hadd determined againste hym, and seinge with all, he was voyde of power to withdrawe his affection, determined his reapose in the laste refuge of Death the last and best re∣pose of mise rye. all miserable creatures, I meane to giue end to his sorowes by death, wherein abhorringe notwithstandynge to defyle his owne handes with the bloude of hym selfe, he resolued to attende his fatall dome in performyng the reste of his py∣nynge dayes, in some deserte or solitary soile not inhabi∣ted but by the sauage societie of wilde beastes, whereunto he added suche expedicion, that the nexte daye he caused to be made secretly two habittes or attires of pilgrims for him selfe and one man, which he ment take to wyth hym, with other necessaries mete to furnishe suche a voyage, the same night also he writ at large to his cruell Geniuera, deliueryng the letter sealed in moste sewer manner, to one of his offi∣cers, to whome he woulde not imparte the mistery but co∣loringe his pilgryms voyage with a Iorney he said he hadd to make to one of his frendes, willed hym to communi∣cate no lesse to his mother, and that within twentye dayes
they sholde exspecte his retorne, for the reste sayeth he, I en∣ioyne the vppon the dutie thou owest me, to deliuer this let∣ter, the fourthe day after my departure to the Lady Geniuera la blonde, who if she seame disdainefull, marke onely with what countenance she refuseth it, wherwith he dismissed hym, and called the other whiche as you haue harde perfor∣med alwayes the messages betwene hym and his mistres, whom onely he made priuie to his deuise, & partaker of hys cruell intente, which seamed so straung in thopinion of his man, that what for the fowlenes of the facte, & speciall care he had of the wel doinge of his maister, he declared frankely his aduise in this sorte: xs it not sufficiēte (sir) saieth he, that you giue your selfe in praye to the crueltie of your mistres His man dis∣suadeth hym from the pil∣grims voiage but also to increase her glorie in sufferynge her crueltie to vanquishe your vertue? are you so ignorāt in the malice of women, that you can not discerne the delite they take to paf¦sion their poore seruantes, triūphing chiefly in the dispaire of such as they haue vnhappely made thrall to their beauty? you ought to eschewe the miserie of that incōuenience, by thautoritie of the wisemen in olde tyme, who founde suche iuste cause of hate agaynst that secte, that they dowted not to tearme theym the common ruyne of men? wherein what other thinge moued the Greke Poet to pronounce his opi∣nion in few wordes vppon the state of women, but that he knewe the felicitie of man to be greater in shoninge thac∣quaintance of that furie, then in embrasynge the society of so perentory an euill, seinge (saieth he) they differ nothinge in disposicion from the serpente, who beyng deliuered from the violence of the frost, and preserued from presente perill of deathe by the husband man, dyd yeld him for recompence, a mortal terror with his venemous hissing, and infected his whole house wt a stinking vapour, oh how happy is he that is the maister of his affections, and enioyenge the benefit of a pleasante libertie, hath the gifte to shon this swéete euill, which so farre (as I sée) is the cause of your present dispaire, besydes (sir) why shoulde not you make an assaye to van∣quishe
thies suggestions of vanitie, seynge that as he yt can maister hym self, maye easely make hym lorde ouer manye thinges, so as the orator affirmeth the moste perfecte vic∣tory The most per¦fect victorie is to make a conquest of our selues. is to make a conquest of our selues: why should you de∣termin so greate an enterprise with thassistance of so slen∣der aduise, seyng that vppon rashe resolucions attendes or∣dinarie rebukes, and he that performes his affaires in hast, repentes comonly at leasure, neyther doth that expedicion showe good successe, whose ende is not conferred with the begynnyng, and guyded wholly by the gouernement of rea∣son and vertue, for as vppon vertuouse entreprises, at∣tendes a fame of honour and renowme, so the rewarde of wicked deuises, is infamye and sometyme shamefull death, and for your parte (sir) lett your auncient wisdome encoun∣ter this femenyne miffortune, in making as litle accompte of your rebell mistres, as she is moste vnworthie to enioye the leaste fauor of your nobilitie, whyche deserueth a more honeste consideration, then a fare well of such tyranouse dis∣position, where with beholdyng some argumentes of anger in the face of his maister, whom he feared to incense to thut termoste, he knitt vp with this resolution: seyng (sayeth he) you are determined in your mishap, I besech you accept my seruice to accompanie your fatall guide, to thende I maye participate with you in your fortune, till the heauens, ceas∣sing to wreake their mallice vppon you, do seame also con∣tented to dymisse the crueltie of your destynies, wherein as he performed the some of his maisters exspectacion, who de∣fiered only the companie of his man in the voyage of hys miserye, so after certeine thankes for his goodwill, he tolde hym that al their furniture was ready, and that there rested nothinge but to departe, whyche they agreed to performe, in the firste hower after midnighte, where unto also thexe∣cution followed accordynglie, for betwene xij. and one of the clocke in the nyghte, our amarous hermitt with hye Diego begin neth his pil∣grymage, man, stealeth secretly oute of hys castell, takyng the fyrste
path whiche his fortune did appointe hym, guided only by the lighte of the moone, without interruption or noyse of other creatures, then the chirpinge brute of the lytle cri∣ckettes solacynge theim selues in their kynde within the creuises of the earth: and wandringe thus by vnknowen wayes the later remeinder of the fearefull nighte, he sawe appeare, in the discouery of the mornynge, when Aurora auaunced her flagge of white and redde, the mornynge starr, whiche some Poetes call the candle that lightes the goddesse of loue from the bedd of her secrett louer, when o the solace of the mornyng, resemblinge his auncient delite when he enioyed ye presence of his mystres, presented a fresh allaram of sorow in recording eftesons his vnhappie chāge of state: wherein, (alas saith he) haue I deserued this plage, that denieth me participacion in the pleasure and contente∣ment Diego com∣plaineth his chaunge of estate vpon the vvaye. of others, who after they haue slepte the course of the nighte vppon the pleasante thoughte of their delite, do a∣wake wyth the heauenlye harmonye and charme of lytle birdes, with assurance to enioye theffect of that, whiche a shadowe or delitefull vision of the sprite presented theym in the night sleping in so greate contentemente, where I (vn∣happie that I am) moste cruelly attended vppon with a con∣trarye destenie, and in place to enioye a simple benefytt or priuiledge of that whiche all other haue in common, am forced, to wander when all creatures are admitted to reste, hauing only thaire of deserts and lawnes vninhabitable to recorde thecco of my sorowes, and the feloweship of wilde bestes to assiste the tunes of my complaintes? Ah Venus whose starre heretofore hath onely guyded me, and whose beames, of longe, haue taken roote in my harte? what cause haue I to complaine of thy iniustice, whiche yeldes me fals∣hood for faith, and tormente for true constancie of mynde? if this be the hier of loyaltie, why beareste thou the tytle of iuste? the pennance I endure dischargeth the of the name of mercifull, or if thou deale so seuerly wyth thy true ser∣seruantes?
Why kepest thou the course amongest the orient planettes of the heauen? Albeit yf I abuselthy honor in blasphemyng the maiestie of thy godheade, I sewe for no fauor, seinge I fele alredye the ful weighte of thy heauye hande, neyther haste thou any punishement in store, wher∣of I taste not the force in this my vnworthie affliction, whiche seinge it procedes by thinfluence of the starr whiche gouerneth me, dispatche at once the messenger of thy deter∣minacion, to thende that by my death, my distresse may re∣ceiue ende, and my cruell mistres performe her glorious triumphe in the victorye of my pynynge lyfe: His com∣plaintes coulde not so staye the swifte course of tyme, but or he was ware, the heighte of the son showed the declining of the daye, whiche moued hym to increase his pase, leauing the common wayes, to folowe the pathes leaste acquain∣ted with traueile, wherein they continued withoute inter∣mission till the cloasinge of the euenyng: when the weary∣nes of their horsses forced theim to discend, and take harbor within a litle village farre from the ordinary waye, from whence after some litle reléeff to their horsses, and lesse rest to theim selues, they departed, wandring in that sorte by the space of thrée or foure dayes and nightes, thende whereof broughte theim at laste to the foote of a large mountaine, in∣habited onely with sauage beastes and creatures vnreaso∣nable, discoueringe rounde about, a platt or soile of plea∣same prospecte, and moste proper to shroode the solitarie life of the wandrynge knyghte, for if he delyted in the shade, he hadd there the benefytt of a nomber of pleasante trées, whiche nature seamed to lende hym as a speciall solace in that wyldernes: When his sorowe desyered the vse of a more open prospecte, the plaine forrestes and chases, wyth theyr wholle heardes of deare of all fortes, offred to giue hym skoape to recorde his gréeffe, and for chaunge of recreation, he mighte viewe there the hideus and highe rockes, whose stéepnes and craggie scituation, albeit mo∣ued a terrour to the beholders, yet were they not without
cause of greate delite, by reason of the pleasant grene, garnished with the tappissery of diuerse flowers, spreadyng theim selues all a onge the heighte of the sayde mountes, but that whiche moued moste his affection to that place, was a merueilous faire and rowmey caue, enuironed on all sides with béeche, cypres, pyneaple and ceder trées, wyth other braunches yeldynge frutes of diuerse kindes, righte afore the mouth or openyng of the which, tendyng to the valley, appered a nomber of pleasante graftes, whose rootes recei∣uing moisture by a cleare streame passing wyth softe noyse all alonge the dore of the caue, gaue suche bountifull nor∣ryture to the twigges & tender branches, that thonly topps bowed downe and dipped theim selues, as vppon dutie, in a fountaine of wonderfull clearenes, fedyng continuallye the saide streame, all whiche seamed to offer suche solace to the solytarye intent of Diego, that without further aduise he de∣termined to performe there the penance he wente to doo, and to conuerte that house, builded by nature, to the mo∣nasterye of his profession, wherein he mente to ende the voyage of his deuocions, commandynge his man to alight, who vnsadlinge their horses, gaue theim the keye of the wilde forestes, whereof hetherto they harde no newes. Touchinge their saddells, with the harnesse, and other fur∣niture of their horsses, they bestowed within a litle cell or corner in their caue, where also, leauing their ordinarye apparell, they putt on theyr habittes of pilgrim, there his man made prouision accordynge to the condicion of their state, and necessitye of the place, dyggynge for his firste indeuor, certeine soddes and lomppes of claye wherewith he entrenched and rampierd their felden shopp, to defende theym againste the furye of wilde beastes, who otherwayes myghte oppresse theym in the nyghte, he made also twoo beddes or lytle couches of softe mosse wyth a testure and sides of wodde, which he hewde in no lesse fyne proporcion, then yf the skill of the Carpenter had assisted the worke.
they hadd no other reléeffe or foode for longe tyme then of the frute whiche the wilde trees did yelde theym, one lesse sometime, for a chaunge of dyot, they were gladd to feede of rawe rootes, whiche they digged out of thintrailles of the earth, vntill extreme hunger preferred a meane to supplie their thinne fare, whiche was, that his man made a cros∣bowe, with the whiche they killed often times the hare and conie fedynge at reléeff, some time they beguiled the wilde goate in the mountaines, and were often the bane of a greater beaste in the forreste, whose blood they pressed be∣twene twoo peces of woode, made for the nonst, deuidynge theim into morsells, whiche they rosted wyth the heatte of the son, and so furnished, in sober manner, their leane table, disgestynge theyr rude and vnholsome dyelt, wyth a cuppe of colde water, whereof they had no lesse plentye, with no more charges, then, when they commaunded ouer whole cellers of delicate wyne in the pallayes of Dom Diego, who increased the dweile of his presente miserye wyth teares of continuall complainte, inueighynge againste the malice of his fortune, wherein he vsed as a common exercise, to walke all alone in the moste daungerous places of the desertes, enterteynyng his solytarye thoughtes, or rather of intente to offer hym selfe a praye to the Iawes of some Lyon or Tygre or merciles beare discendynge from the mountaines, but the seruante-doubtynge the re∣solucion of his maister, preuented theffecte of desperati∣on wyth his contynuall presence, exclamynge (as farre as he durste) againste suche vanities and actes of frennezie, wherein if by chaunce, he lett escape anye worde re∣prehendynge the crueltye or wronge don vnto hym by his mystres, yt was a pastyme to see the alteration of Diego, srorminge againste the prelumptuouse audacitye in hys man, in suche sorte, as continuinge eftesones to accuse her discourtesie, he wolde not stike to threaten hym so farre, that if it were not for the respecte of the

Dom Diego, The tragicall contentes of this letter strick such soddaine dollor into the mynd of thold lady, that she seamed to partici∣pate wt thaffliction of the pore forrestian hermit, albeit dissi∣muling her passiō affore her howshold seruātes, retired into her chāber with her doughter only whō she failed not to re∣buke in sharp sort for her folish cruelty, as the only cause of the losse of so worthy a knyghte as Seigneur Diego, whose letter albeit she deciphered vnto her worde by word, profer ringe with al, sondry ymportunities for mediacion & grace on his behalfe, yet seamed she as weake, to moue the harde harte of her doughter, as the myld Zephir, breathyng from ye western shore, is hable to shake the monstrus rockes builded in the belly of the sea, and muche lesse the passion of her∣fury, iudginge his penance far inferior to ye desert of his in∣cōstancy, wherwith the simple mother father complayning, then correctynge the stubbornes of her doughter, dysmissed the messenger with only charge to salute on her behalfe his misters her deare frende and neighbour, who altogether ig∣norāt

This quarrell grew to such tearmes of reuenge, that therle of Celye beyng one day in a churche in one of the chief Cities of Hungarie, was mordered by the handes of the sayde Vnyade, whych beyng brought ymediatly to the eares of the kynge, hee was aduised to dyssymule hys iuste wrathe, for that at such hower he was not of sufficiente power to gyue correction to o greate a presumption, albeit retiringe yme∣diatlye to Budo, thordynarye place of hys abode, and where hys greatest force remeyned, he seased vpon bothe the chil∣dren of VVayuode, and stryke of the heade of the theldeste
called Ladislas, deferring iustice to the other named Mathias, for the respecte of his young yeres, albeit he inclosed hym in sewer prison, within the kingdom of Boemia, where, as he re∣mayned without hope of longe life, or ende of his imprison∣ment, but by death: So it chaunced not longe after, that the kynge Ladislas comminge to do execution of thinfāte of wy∣uado, dyed in the same towne, where he indured his misera∣ble captiuitie, whereupon the Boemians chosed for their king one George Pogibracehio, the Hungariens on the other side, aduertised of the death of their soueraine, began to enter in∣to compassion towardes the prisoner, and preferringe to memory the vertue of his father, at such time as he bare au∣thoritie in their publike weale, they proclaimed Mathias king of Hongarie, who beinge in the custodie and daunger of George newly adopted kyng of Boemya, was not only dely∣uered by hym, but also, he gaue hym his doughter in ma∣riag, by which meanes, of a pore desperat prisoner, he becam in one instant a puissant Kinge, wherunto as he durste ne∣uer before aspire by any hope or likelihod yt appered, so if it had not ben for his aduersitie, he had neuer sit in ye seate roy∣all of Hungary, bothe for that they woulde haue chosen an other, his elder brother Ladislas hadd bene afore hym, the countie whiche they slewe woulde haue resisted suche pre∣ferment, but chieflye it is lyke the Hungariens would not hau giuen hym suche large title of dignitye, if it had not ben for the respecte of cōpassion they vsed vppon his miserable captiuitie, who as he came to ye crowne (as you sée) by ye same meane which ye other lost it, so the famous Historiographer Ti∣tus Liuius, makes mencion of the like accidente happening to Iacques de Lusiano vncle to Petre, kyng of Cipres, at ye solemne feast of whose coronatiō, the Ieneuoys & Venetiens cōtended for superioritie, either of theim striuing for the prefermente of the firste place in that assemblie, in the presence of whome, Iacques de Lusiuano partiall on the Venetiens side, caused cer∣teine of the Ieneuoyes to be executed, wherof the state of Ieyne, being aduertised, determined to take cruel vengāce, where
vnto they added such expedicion, that in a moniēt they had le∣uied a great armye vnder the conduction of Pierro Fregose a Venice taken and putt to sacke by Pirro Fregos. most excellent captain by sea, who discarged ye creditt of hys cōmission wt so good fortune, that the toke ye yle & put the citie to sacke, reseruyng notwithstandyng, the life of Iaques Lusy∣uano, whom he caried prisoner to Ieane, wher the senate en∣ioyned him to perpertual ymprisonment wtin the strongest tower of their citie, wherin albeit he continued (without hope of libertie, or exspectacion to enioy any parte of his auncient dignitie) by the space of nyne yers, yet yt happened in ye ende of the said tearme, that fortune torning her whéele, gaue sa feconduit to the king Pierro to passe into thother world, with out heire of hys body, by reason wherof thinhabitātes of the yle consideryng Seigneur Lusyuano was of the blodd royal, and nexte parent to their dead lord, tooke such compassion of hys captiuitie with a remorce of his long pennance, that incon∣sideration of his misery, procedynge by their occasion, they redemed his liberty with a great exaction of money, and an∣noynted hym kinge of Cypres, which peraduenture he hadd neuer possessed, yf the desolacion of his ymprisonement had not wroughte the meane, (albeit he had enioyed his libertie and pursewed it to thuttermost) such is the wonderfull pro∣uidence of God, punishynge the wicked at his pleasure, and (restoring the misery of such as dispaire of worldly succour) exposeth effectes of his omnipotencie excedynge thexspecta∣cion and ymagynacion of the creatures of the earthe: suche was also the case of Dom Diego, who determined wholly to spende the remeynder of his lyfe in the studie of solytarie philosophie vpon the wilde and riche mountes Pireney, was reliued and restored when he was leaste in opinion or hope of succour. For as you haue hard he had a neyghbour and deare frende called Dom Roderico who aboue the rest, lamēted chiefly tha∣sence and misfortune of Diego. It chaunced within twenty and two monethes after the pilgrim began his voyage, that this Roderico (hauyng bene in Gascoyne to dispatche certeine
necessary affaires there) in his retorne to Barcelonia, whether he had missed the path of his righte waye, or that the sprite of god (as it was moste lyke) guided hym, was or he wyste vpon the caryre that ledd him directly to that place of the moūtes, where was thordinary residence of his great frende Diego, who grew so fast into declynation and debilitie of hys body, that if ye clemency of the highest had not ouer shadowed him, he had wroughte the wretched effecte of that which he chiefly desired, that is with the losse of life, to giue ende to his harde pennance. Dom Roderico wandring thus in the wildernes of ye moun∣tes, dispercing his traine to discouer some places of habita∣cion, was aduertised by one of his people, being within twel∣uescore yardes of the hermits caue, of a tracke & steppes of men, not without some merueile notwithstandyng, for that thinfertillety of ye place showed no aboad nor repaire for ci∣uil people, wherupō as they debated & were in deuise to ap∣point one of the companie to follow the trace somwhat fur∣ther, they sawe one enter the mouth of the caue, which was Dom Diego, who came from the top of the hill affore mencio∣ned, wher he had newly performed his morninge cōplaint, with his face directly toward the cost, where he iudged was thoracle of the saint to whō he dressed his deuocions, ye knight sente one of his valletts to approche the caue, & know what they were, yt liued so solitarily, and withall to demaunde the highe waye to Barcelonia, but he discouering (a far the scitua∣cion of the hoale so wel fortefied & rampierd with stones and blockes cowched in the forme of a trenche, fearing the same to be the receptacle or forte of some that kept house by the highe waie side liuing of large reuenue, durst neither come Theues. nere it nor aske the way as he was cōmanded by his maister to whom as he retorned with more fear of his shadow, then true reaporte of that he had in charge, so the valiant knight, of more courage then his cowardly seruant, put spurres to his horsse, gallopyng to the veraye dore of the caue, where he ceased not to call and knocke, till he sawe comme owte
a mā, so disfigured with leannes of his face, & other exterior deformotie of his bodye, that his veraye regard moued com∣passion to Roderico, who asking what he was, demaūded also the cōmon waye to Barcelonia, this was the seruant of Diego, who aunswered that he could yelde him no reason of ye waye to Barcelonya, and lesse instructe him touchinge the costes of the contrey, for that (saieth he) (not without some sighes & other doleful regardes) we are two pore brethern, whom the aduenture of fortune hath brought hether to do pennance, & mortifie our present age for the synnes and offences of our youth passed, which wordes of two pore bretherne broughte thether as strangers, by the guide of fortune, with the pre∣sente remembrance of Diego & his seruante, argued such sus∣picion to Roderico that he alighted, not for that he thoughte to encounter him whom he most desired to embrase, but to sée only the singularities of the rocke, and the mistery of the closse castel, builded in the bellye of the earth, where finding hym whom he serched (without knowing notwithstādynge what he was) entered into conference together of the diffe∣rence betwen the felicitie of the solitary lif, & miseries which they fynde that participate with the wretched follies of this worlde, for (sayeth he) the mynde withdrawen frō ye viewe of worldly vanities, takes his only pleasure in the contempla∣ciō of heauēly thinges, being alwaies more apte to obserue the cōmandements of God, with a sincere reuerence to their maker, then those whiche haunte the cōmon conuersation of men Wherin truely (when all is said) continuall frequen∣tciō one with an other, delites, ambicious, couetousnes, & superfluities of all vices, whiche we finde in this confused amass & corrupte worlde, do cause vs to mistake our selues, forget our dutie towardes our creator, fall into a perillous disdaine of pitie & charitie, & some time to diuerte the since∣ritie of the true religion, & abuse thintegritie & vndoubted interpretation of the gospell, which I leaue to be debated at large by ye theologiās to whō such charge doth cheifly apper∣teine. As ye vnknowen hermit & the knight Roderico were in
deuises, certeine of his seruantes visitinge euery cell and celler of the caue, founde in the toppe of a vawlte framed of certeine sparres of wood, rammed in ye earthie wal at both endes, two saddells, the one wherof (seamynge to haue ser∣ued heretofore some faire Ienett), was couered with crim∣syn veluett, fringed rounde aboute wyth siluer throme, stodded with nailes of sondrie enameyle, and armed wyth plates of steile, wrought curiouslye vppon, with certeine rayes and streames of pure golde, which (albeit the rouste had defaced the stéele) loste nothinge of his entyer and beau∣tye, and as one of the companie offred to buye theym, seing neyther horsse nor moyle worthie to weare such furniture, ye knight, hauing ended his discourse with ye maister hermitt, soūded to horsse with intent to leaue the poore men in peace, and searche some other meane to fynde out the high waye, whereuppon he that was desyerous to buy the saddels, pre∣sented theym to his maister, who as he behelde theym, felte a seconde motion or remembrance of his frende Diego, wher∣with searchinge the harneys & euery pendell of the sadle, he founde this inscription written in spanishe vppon the crooper Quebratare la fe, es cosa muy fea, which is in englishe, to breake thy faith is a detestable thinge. This deuise restored cause of newe astonishmente, for that it agreed wyth thordynary stampp whiche Dom Diego bare alwaies in his armour, which the rather confirmed him in opinion, that without doubte the sadle apperteined to the one of the two pilgrims, whom as he began to beholde with a more percinge regarde then afore, without discerninge in either of theim any signe or marke of knowledge, by reason of their hideus and disfigured hewe: So Dom Diego seinge the diligence of his frende, with desier he hadd to discouer him, began to labor of a passiō of trembling feare, with such Ielewse doubte of him selfe, that the blodd (moued in thin∣ner parts, and ascended (maugre his resistance) into the face and other places of discouery, bewrayed thinward alteratiō of his minde, which with the vncerteine regard of his eyes,
showed to Roderico an absolute assurance of that which earst he durste not suspecte, & that whiche gaue also credit to his conceite, was a locke of his curled heare, whiche he kepte wrapte about his righte eare, whereupon he dismissed all suspicion, & as one assured of his doubte, threwe his armes about the necke of his frende, wateryng his breste with the teares of his eyes and saide vnto him, Alas Seigneur Diego, Roderico dis couereth & embraseth his frende Dom Diego. what disfauor of the heauens haue kepte you so longe from the companie of those that dye of distresse in the absence of you, whose presence was the piller of their consolation? What be they that haue procured this longe eclipps of your name, when it ought to expose the clearest light, both for the glorie of your present youth, & honor of your future old age? Ah is it my company that moues this longe scilence in you, is it I that haue deserued this wrong at your handes, to a∣buse the vertue of my honeste frendshipp with a shamefull feare to disclose your self vnto me, & doom regardes without argument of gladnes? Do you thinke alas, that I know not him whome I embrace? no no, I can not be so simple nor my iudgement blinded any longer in the knowledge of him, whom the secret instinct of my harte discouered at my first entrey into this caue, neither is there any part in me of iud∣ment, that doubteth you to be the same Seigneur Diego, whose renowme resowndes thuttermost confynes of spaine, and God forbid, that I departe here hens, without carieng with me the glorie of equal contentement to ii. indifferently pas∣sioned in your absence, the one to my selfe, ioyinge in my happie fortune, to drawe you out of the dongeō of this cala∣mitye, the other in makinge so gladsome a present to your mother, impartinge also the ioyful newes to your subiectes and seruantes, whose eyes are not yet drie with the teares of your departure. Here Dom Diego seing he could no lōger dissemble that which was so plainly disclosed, & construing to the best the thanke∣ful cōgratulaciōs of his frend, began to relente in his hart, no lesse then the gladsom mother in recoueringe her childe
that hath bene longe kepte from her, or the chaste wi, (lōg destitute of the presence of her deare husbāde) reioyseth whē she holdes him in her armes & may embrase him at pleasure, wherin being also indifferently passioned betwene delite & dollor, honest shame & semblable feare, passinge a declaratiō of his inwarde trouble of minde by the cōduites of his eyes, distilling streames of sorowe & ioye by great aboundance, re∣tourned thimbrassements of his frende, with no lesse hartie affection, then the other with good will, somoned this new acquaintance, sainge, Ah howe secret is the determination of God & his iudgementes inscrutable, I resolued here to at∣tende the ende of my miserable dayes, without making my Diego ac∣knovvled∣geth himselfe to Roderico. intente priuie to any man in the worlde, and lo nowe am I delried, when I feared leaste my discouerie, I am trulye sayeth he, with a pitifull discharge of a nomber of dollorous sighes, the same infortunat Diego and your deare frende, who (persecuted with continuall affliction and tormente of fortune), was so weary of the worlde, that I chosed this de∣serte habitation, as a secrett receptacle, to performe the reste of the voyage which nature hath enioyned me in this tran∣storie and wretched vale, where seinge you haue vnhappe∣ly discouered me, I beseche you (by the honor of your name, & vertue of that frendship contynued betwene vs from the beginning), let it suffice you that you haue séene me, with∣out procuring impedimente to the reste of my willing pen∣nance, by imparting the place of my retreate to any. Wherunto Roderico did not only refuse to cōdiscēde, but also continuing his former earnest, perswaded him to discōtinue that brutal lif, with admonitiō yt God had made theim noble, & giuen theim authoritie, not with charge, to liue idle eyther in their pallaceis or other obscure place, but so to bestowe their tallente, yt with the exāple of their vertue, thignorant may be instructed in ye trade of honeste liuing, the good men Thoffice of a noble man or one in au∣thoritie. supported in their integritie, & the bad sorte kepte in awe by their iustice. And for your part (saith he) how vainely may your subiectes & people reioyse, in that God hath blessed theim with a Lord
to their contentacion, yf affore thexperience of our vertue, they loase the cause of their contentement: what comfort or quiett thynke you, can harbor within the carefull breste of your desolate mother, who hath made the world happy with so honest a son, bringinge you vp with suche diligence, that you lacke nothing to make you parfect, & in this sort to loase the frute & exspectaciō of such norriture? it is you (sir) whō du¦tie commaunds to yeld obedience to your parentes, soccour to thafflicted, & do iustice to such as demaunde right at your hand? alas it is your pore subiectes who, lamenting your ab¦sence, complaines of the wrong you do to theym in dēnieng the vse of your presence? it is you that ouerwhelmes tholde yeares of your mother with vntymely desolation? it is you that reneweth the course of her continuall complaintes in breakyng your faith towching the day of your reatorne. Wherwith thinpatience of Dom Diego in hearynge thobiec∣tions of his owne faltes, brake his furder discourse, excu∣syng him selfe in this sorte. Yt is easie (saieth he) for hym that is well to compforte the sicke, and harde for such as be in distres, to admitt any coun∣cell Diego excu∣seth hys de∣parture from his contrey. in their euil: you finde a facilitie to giue iudgemente of my disease, beinge whollye ignorante of the cause, & accuse my absence rather by desier to do me good, thē of any malice you owe to my wretched state, but if you vnderstode the cir∣cunstance of my misfortune, and the occasion that first mo∣ued me to make trial of this solitary life, you wold conuerte (I doute not) this sinister conceite of the wronge which you charge me to do to all men, to an oppinion of ryghte on my behalfe, seing the most wise, & assured of al, assailed with the lyke tormente of sprite, which I féele quarrelling with the constancye of my mynde, haue lefte example of faltes of no lesse fragilitie, then myne, I confesse is iustely meritorious of reprehencion, wherewith drawing Rodorico aparte frome the reste, he preferred a particular discourse of his loue, his possibilitie & good hope in ye beginning, his sinister successe in thend, withe the continu acion of the vniuste crueltye of his
mistres, whose name he cold not pronounce without suche fluddes of teares and skorchynge sighes, that for the tyme they staied the course of his wordes, mouinge suche com∣passion to the tender harte of Roderico, that he was forced to kepe him companie wt semblable kindnes, assaing notwith∣standing to remoue the vaile of such desperat opinion, with request to discontinue his sauage lyfe in the desolate forre∣stes, wherein he preuailed asmuche as if he had vndertaken to perswade a multitude without a toung, for that the resol¦ued hermit told hym, that he wolde not only be tenant to the mountes so long as nature & he cold agrée vpon the bargain of lyfe, but also aduowed vnto hym by othe, that (withoute the good will of his Geniuera) he wolde neuer retorne to hys contrey, & (to auoyde further discouery) wold seke to shrowd hym selfe in a place more sauage, & lesse frequented thē this, for saieth he) like as my retorne wold bryng but increase of passiō, specially in being denied fauor wher I haue foūd a for¦mer repulse I besech you, let it suffice yt I fele ye burdē of one mishap, ceassing to allure me to ye prooff of a secōd affliction wourse I am sewer, then my presente punishemente, wher∣unto I haue added a contentement with an immouable pa∣cience: wherin his raisons seamed to include such indifferēt iustice and pitie, that Roderico cold not replie but with tear∣mes of compassion, with consente that he shoulde contynue his abode there yet ij. monethes, in whych tyme he sware vnto hym (by the honor of knightehodd), that for hys parte, he would not only make his peace with his cruell mistres, but also procure mutuall conference betwene theym, assu∣ring hym withall, that he should not be discouered by hym nor any of hys trayne, wherewith, leauynge hym a féelde bedde and ij menne wyth money too furnyshe hys wante, he tooke hys leaue, wyth firme promisse to sée hym a∣gaine in shorte tyme, with cause of more contentemente, then at that presente he lefte hym full of annoye and hym¦selfe no lesse disquieted for the trouble of his frende, wherin God knoweth in what sorte he detested (by the wayes) the
wilfull crueltie of Geniuera, blasphemyng no lesse agaynste the whole secte (paraduenture) with some raison. For there is (I can not tel) what secret motions in the myndes of wo∣men which haue their howers and tymes as thincreasynge or dyminishynge of the moone, whereof as it is veray harde (without great experience) to giue any raison touchinge the cause, So we sée it is such a principle or generalitie amongst theime to ymprinte so sewerly in their hartes this fraile or rather inconstante instinctes of mobilitie, that the wiseste & most subtill that euer was, lacke skill to obserue the seasons of this ymperfecte humor. Dom Roderico by this was arryued at his house, wher he nei∣ther forgatt his owne promisse, nor the necessitie of hys frende, for the nexte daye he wente to the lodgynge of Geni∣uera, not to communicate with her asyett, and muche lesse to impart his fortunat encounter in his retorne out of Gascoyn, but rather to sounde by some secrett circumstance a farr of, the doinges and determination of the girle, & whether any other vsurped the glorie of the victorie, which of righte be∣longed to his frende Diego, wherein he was so subtill in this drifte, that he accoasted the page of the gentlewoman, in whose bosome was builded the only store house of her moste secret affaires, forgettinge therin the precepte of the wise, who willes vs to cōmit no councell to suche as are weake of raison, and for wāte of discretion, do lacke the gifte of secrete¦nes, The vvise man vvil ne∣uer comytt councelle to children whereby they are not hable to gouerne the libertye of their tounges, suche was the simplicitie of this page, whose softe humor, the knighte fed with such fine dyot, that by litle and litle, he drew the worme quite from his nose, and was made so priuie to the practis of Geniuera, that he vnderstode, that since her vniuste displeasure with Dom Diego, she hadd vowed her good wil to a biskaine, as then ye steward of her mo¦thers house, a gentleman veray pore, but for the rest of suffi¦ciēt perfection, & that he was now in ye cōtrey, frō whence he gaue aduertismēt to his mistres, yt within two days he wold come wt ij. other his deare frends, to take Geniuera, awaye by
stealth, not forgetting also yt he only (wt a gētlwoman) were appointed to attend her into Byskaye, like as they wer priuie to euery circunstance of their secret sleight, which discourse of ye boye, albeit moued show of inward alteratiō in Roderico, chiefly for the infidelity & treyson of thinconstant Geniuera, yet he dyssimuled so well his fretting anger, yt his passion was not discouered by the simple page, with whom he ioy∣ned in cōmendacion towching the resolucion of his mistres, whom he sayed was not voyde of reason to make her choice by the councell & consente of her fancie, seynge her mother vsed such slender diligence to bestowe her as she deserued, & albeit (saith he) the gentleman be not riche nor of large pos∣sessions, yet thy mistres hath sufficient meanes to supplye both their wantes that waye, only she declareth a vertue in yeldyng so firme affection to his honeste pouertie, all which as he pronounced by an other tounge, then the true inter∣pretor of his hart, so beyng alone, cryeng out of thinconstā∣cie of women, he seamed to put no difference betwene their wilfull blindnes, and natural simplicitie of young infantes, VVomen cō∣pared to infa∣tes. who whē they seame most wrabbed, their norsse offrīg theim the choice of an aple or tigge, & a Jewel of gret price, are ra∣ther appaised with the figge, thē once loke of ye thyng of va∣lue, So some women, whether it be the mist of fonde loue yt blaires their eies, or the dome of a cursed desteny, which god hath appointed to plage their malicius disposiciō, seame of∣ten times so voide of raisō, yt being presented with the choice of two offers far differing in value, thei are rather apt to im¦brase ye worst, then redy to admit ye best, which is most cōue∣niēt for their honor & calling: he defaced ye beauty of Geniuera with the destoyaltye she vsed towardes her firste seruante, condemnynge her iudgement in refusing the frendship of a noble man, famous by wealth and vertue, & the veray parra¦gon of the wholle contrey, for the society of a pore cōpanion, whose parentes beynge vnknowen, argued a doute of hys discente, and she altogether astraunger to bys dispocition, wherin as he inueighed also indifferently against ye partial∣litie of fortune and blindnes of loue, who beyng wythoute
eyes theym selues, do likewise dym the vnderstandinge of such as they kepe in miserable captiuitie. So he sware in great rage, to caste such a blocke in the waye of the two lo∣uers, that neyther the biskayn sholde reape the frutes due to the trauaile and seruice of his frende Diego, nor his cruell mistres forbeare any longer to sende a pleasante calme to the stormye tempest whiche kepes hym now at anker amon∣gest the perillous rockes of Pireneus. For being enformed of this conuenient meane to ease the distresse of his languishinge frend, who fedd only of the hope of his promise, he failed not to add an assured effect according lie, Albeit for his further instruction touching the sewer con ueigh of the misterie, he went the seconde daye after, to visit the mother of Geniuera, wher he vnderstode by the page, that the stewarde was come with two other valyante gentlemen to assiste his enterprise, and that the nexte nighte vppon the first hower after midnighte, when the olde Ladye and all her seruantes, ouerwhelmed wyth the charme or mantel of dead slepe, were least apte to suspect conspiracies, they determy∣ned to depart the castell with his mistres, who for her parte had furnished her wantes of all necessaryes touchinge the voyage. This hastie resolucion required a spedie diligence in the knight, who for hys parte also vsed no lesse expedicion then was conuenient, for beynge come to hys house he caused to arme ten or xy. gentlemen of hys neyghbours and vassalls, to whom he communicated the some of hys intente, and the same night, some two or thrée howers affore the departure of the Biskayne and hys companye, marched in secret maner directly in the waye, where they sholde passe, til they came to a groue or coppyes of younge woode, regardinge the highe way on the one side, and a mayne common or plaine on tho∣ther syde, where bestowinge himselfe and his company in am bushe, he harde yinediatly the noyse of horsses and men ap∣proching with an vnfortunate diligence: the lighte of the moone discouered the gentlewoman, whose bewtie seamed
to contende with the brightnes of the same, nexte vnto whō ridd her miserable louer, whome assone as Roderico parcei∣ued within the daunger of his carear, he felt a conuersion of his aunciente anger into a compassion of presente furye, whose force sommonynge hym to an effect of morder, caused hym to cowche his speare in his reaste, directinge his angrie Roderico killeth the biskaine. course so rightly towardes the poore byskayne, that in one momente he pearsed hym thorowe the body, sendinge hym wythout other pasporte to the miserable crewe of those wret ches, who seruinge vnder thensigne of folishe loue, do perish Cupido. vnhappely vnder the conduction of a blinde and naked boye, aduising the rest of the biskaines to eschew the like reward oneless they attended a semblable hier to hym that had wrōg fully encroched vpon the grounde of another: they seamed more willinge to accepte his offer, then readie to reuenge the death of their captaine, Whome (seinge the discouerie o the whole ambushe) they lefte on the grounde takinge hys leaue of his mistres with the laste breath of his life, and rea∣posed their chiefeste confidence in the swiftnes of their hor∣ses, without regarde who pursewed their hastie flight, yme∣diatlye two of the company of Dom Roderico disguised in vn∣knowen armour, seased vpon the sorowfull Geniuera, who cold not vse such patience in the death of her biskaine louer, but her open cries complayninge of the villenye of the mor∣der, witnessed her inwarde sorowe of mynde, wherin accor∣ding to the shortnes of her breath, (laboring then in passion of extreme dollor) she exclaymed without respecte agaynste theym, crying to performe an execution of their crueltie vpon her, aswel as they had discharged the office of vniuste tormentors of one, who was of more price then they all, and so torninge her to the dead bodie of her late frende, washed a waye the blod of his woundes with the teares of her eyes, not without great exclamacion agaynst the malice of her destenies, in abridginge her exspectacion of longe ioye, wyth so short and tragicall an ende, forcing her to resigne the soci∣tie of hym, whom she loued no lesse then her selfe, to commit
the honor of her virginitie to a praye to thees and villey∣nes, wherwith Roderico, without disclosinge his face, or other parte of knowledge, tooke her by the hande, with perswaci∣on to dismisse these dollors, seinge that her complaintes had no vertue to restore life to hym that was deade, and muche lesse to take vengance of the fact. But she renewinge the re∣membrance of hym that laye dead of the ground, by certeine streames of his blodd, whyche she espied vpon the gawntlet of Roderico, began to loase more pacience then affore, in such sorte, that the rudest of the companye, hauing for an increase of his terrible regarde a visarne or false beard of blacke heare curled like the Mauretyne, with a paire of counterfaite eyes of glasse, approched (by appointment) the trembing Geniuera, to whose feare hee added an increase of terror in offringe the point of hys naked dagger to her white and delicate necke, threatninge, that if she contynued in these tearmes, hys han∣des shold performe the sacrafize of her life, to the shadowe of the villayne whom she lamented so much, and who (saith he) deserued rather to be broken in peces of the whele, by the execucioners of tormentes, then ende hys lyfe by the handes of a valyant knight, which mortall threates (as she thought) forcing her to an vnwilling scilence, left her only thassistāce of her eyes, to yelde compassion to her greffe, who set a broch so larglye the conduites of their watery humors, that the passion of her harte appeared in thabundance of her teares and brokē sighes, whose force preuailed so much ouer her tender resistance, that in thende her outwarde dule seamed inclosed and couched by force, in the ynner corners of her heauy harte, in the meane while the reste of the companye, had caryed the bodie of the deade biskayne to a felden chapel, builded vpon the high way side, where he sleapes in hisfatal bed couered with a testor of greene soddes. A notable example sewer, prouing the ordynarie successe of secret contractes and mariages made by stelth, where bothe the honor of the contractors loseth his vertue, and the com∣maundemente of God broken, enioyninge vs by speciall

can I visit the darke shadoes and ghostes disburdned of this lyfe, then to yelde vp breath in the presence of her, whom if I haue honored in my life, it is nothing in respect of the ser∣uice my soule hath vowed on her behalfe in the other world in goinge affore to performe the office of her harbinger a∣monge the Angels in paradise: in the meane while Dom Rode¦rico, who hetherto had not discouered himselfe to Geniuera, was disarmed, and with open face accosteth her as she rydes debating with her in this sort. I dowt not at all, but you finde it very straunge, to sée me in this place in such attyre, and vpon an occasion, so contra∣ry to the rancke and honor I professe, & the rather by thexpe∣rience Roderico to geniuera. of the present Iniury you thinke you haue receiued by me, who hetherto haue borne the face of an affectioned frende to all your house, and me thinke I sée how you dispose your selfe to accuse thiniustice of my cause, in forcinge you to exchaunge the companie of your deare frende, to commit you to the societie of these deserte confines, wherein also as I haue nothing to defend me from ymputaciō of iust blame on your behalfe, but the vertue of that true frendship which knittes together with an indissoluble vnitie the hartes of men, so for your part, if you will rightly measure my honest meaninge in this enterprise, and remouing the vaile of per∣tiall disdayne, disgest the angrie beginning with ymagyna∣cion of a pleasante ende, I dare abide the sentence of your in different iudgement, whether I be wholly worthie of repre∣hencion, or you altogether voyde of falte. I besech you also consider that the true and loyal seruante, indeuoringe hymselfe to performe to thuttermoste, the will of hym that hath power to commaunde hym, dothe not only deserue a chiefe place of fauor with his Lord, but also a con∣sideracion according to the merit of his seruice, whych I do not infer to solicit my thankes wyth you, whom I haue ra∣ther offended then contented, in exposing on effecte of ho∣nest zeale I owe to all verteus and chast Ladyes, whereof for your parte you shall fynde me no nigardee on your be∣behalf
in time and place of nede, desiering you (in dismissing al sinister conceites of vnworthie grudge) to preferr no less modestie then oughte to accompanie a gentlewomā of your age & calling, seing that honor seameth beste contented with the place & subiecte where he remeineth, vsing curtesie, then in abusing their greatnes, to preferre malicious crueltye, and because we approche neare the place, where I intende (God willing) to presente you, cutting of now your suspēce with an exposicion of my meanynge, you muste note, that, that whiche is alreadye paste, with the residue yet to be per∣formed, tendeth to no other ende, then to releue the distresse of ye most loyal louer that this daye hath his being vnter the circle of the moe: Yt is the noble & valyante knighte Dom Diego, the moste constante seruan te that euer bare name to be worthie to do seruice to any Ladye, who for the respecte of your displeasure, hath registred hymselfe amydd the hi∣deus rockes of theis sauage and solitarie valleys, it is to hym I leade you, (protestinge to you by the heauens) that the miserie wherein I sawe hym plunged on all sides, not sixe wekes passed, touched me so neare, that if the sacrifize of my life onelye woulde haue discharged the price or raunsom of his martirdom, you had bene frée from this passion of perplexitie by my meanes, and I not partaker of theis angrie regardes, which threaten the vtter losse of your good will, wherin as it is only I that haue committed the of∣fence (if there be any falte at all) so I beseche you let me on∣lye endure the punishment, with requeste, that you extende compassion vpon the desolation of him, who almoste wasted with pyninge miserie, reaposeth (for your sake) a felicitie in thextremitie of his hard pennance. If Geniuera were halfe desperat afore, for the death of her Biskaine louer, it is now she is readie to excede the lymittes of raison, frettinge with such inwarde spite against the simple recorde of the name of Diego, yt her malicious rage, forcing a scilece for the time, driue her to a respit in forminge her aunswere, albeit as the passiō of impatience is neither so perillous, nor of such con∣tinuāce
as other traunces accidental or proper, so vnclosing her eyes, she fixed theim vpon Roderico with no lesse furious regard, then the tigress beholding ye deuouring of her whelps afore her face, and wringing her handes, with her long and smale armes a crosse vppon her tender breste, she exclaymed against his discourtesie in this sorte. Ah mordring traitor (saieth she) no more worthie of the ho∣nor of knightehodd, for that thou hast forfeited thy faith by a Geniuera exclameth a∣gainst Rode∣rico. detestable traison, is it vpon me thou oughtest to wreake such an effecte of thy malicious villanye, or hast thou dissem∣bled thy grudge so longe with a showe of fliering fauor (like the cockadrell) towardes all our house, to vomitt thy venim vpon me who neuer deserued but wel at thy handes? Haste thou the face to intreate me for an other, seinge in my presence thou hast killed him whose blood I wil purse we vpō the & thine so longe as I haue one gaspe of breath to accuse thy villanie? what authoritye hast thou to inquire of my do∣inges or impesh my determination, or in what sorte am I bound to yelde ye accōpte of any resolution of mine? who hath made the arbitrator, or much lesse giuen the cōmission to de∣bate vpō tharticles of my mariage? onlesse thy malice will force me to loue that desloyall villaine, for whom thou haste cōmitted an acte of perpetuall infamie to thy name, whereof also for my part, I wil reserue such remēbrance in the store∣house of my hart, that only death shal take awaie ye desier to reuenge the wrong thou hast done me, & albeit fortune hath made me thy prisoner, with power to dispose of me at thy pleasure, yet haue I one resistance to defeate the extremitie of thy force, which also I wil not faile to put in execution, yt is, that afore thy traiterous cliāte Diego quenche his thurste wt the precious Iewste of my virginitie, theis hādes are rea∣die to giue me a fatal pasport to visit (with bloodie ghoste) the loyaltie of him, whō thou hast slain by traiterous cōspiracie? therfore if I maye honestly requeste the whom I hate, or if there be exspectaciō of fauor in a mortal enemie, I besech yt, either performe the laste face of thy crueltie vpon me, or ac∣cording
to thy dutie, dismisse me with my woman and page, to go whether our fortune will guide vs. God forbid saieth Roderico, that in doinge wrong to the hope of my frend, I be∣cōme thoccasiō of his vntimely death, & losse of you, wādring by the vnknowen pathes of this wilde desertes, and continu¦ing stil his former earnest, to moue her to some pitie, vpon ye poore penitencier, he seamed to gaine asmuch as if he had as∣sailed to nomber the sand lying vpō the brinke of the endles occean, albeit with ye supplie of seuerall discourses, they ar∣riued at last at the rich hospital of Dom Diego, who for wante of curious cōceites to welcome his cruel mistres, presented his loathsome parsonage ouergrowen with haire, and for a more showe of humilitie fel prostrate afore her, embracings her féete, not without great effusion of teares, sayinge▪ Alas good madam: the only hope of my life & cōpforte of my Diego vpon his knees  ueth pytye. carefull harte, how long shall I hange in the doubteful bal∣lance of my presente death, or lyfe? what date alas haue you appointed to giue ende to my desperate sorowes, yf my pen∣nance not sufficiente for thoffence I haue committed? Yea What tormente haue you in store, whiche I am not readye to endure to yelde you contentement? neither hadd I hadd breath at this present to put you in rem em brance of my di¦stresse, if I had not with holden my handes from fatal vio∣latiō, to witnes my loayltie on your behalf, and much lesse, bene in case to preferre mine innocencie, yf the onelye foode of secrett contemplation of your beautye, hadd not dis∣tilled continuall orriture to the vitall partes of my consu∣med corps: And as you maye easelye ymagine what plea∣sure I founde in this longe and paineful absence, so I greue not in any thing that is past, nor refuce to abide any future punishment, yf only I maye receiue at your handes the re∣warde of my constancie, whiche I maye boldlye compare wyth the moste assured that euer was.

face, dyd not only refuce to aunswere, but also forbarre to behold hym whom she hated, she barred him also ye benefit of her face, in bestowing her lookes to the contrary side, which moued cause of doble sorow to the poure afflicted louer, who beynge yet vppon his knées, renewinge the sorce of his tea∣res with the viewe of the tyrannye of his mistres, seamed to drawe with muche ado, a feble voyce, from the veray bot∣tom of his stomacke, and restored the tearmes of his former complainte in this sorte, seyng neyther the sincerity of my faithe, approued with so longe and loyall seruice, nor the Dom Diego being stil pro¦strate crieth for cōpassion to his mistrys view of my present misery, wherof I haue made a painefull experience without intermission thies xxij. monethes, bee of force to perswade a creditt in my constancie, seynge also my dolefull teares deriued of the iniustice of your disdaine, are denied to worke effectes of tuste pitie in you, and lastelye, seyng without the consente of your goodwill, I fynde an ympossibilitie to liue, I beseche you,  by the vertue and courtesie whyche oughte to app  I coniure you, as the laste requeste wherewith  tuat seruant will troble you in this worlde, to mor  ur owne han∣des the remembrance of that offen  you ymagyn I haue done agaynst you, with there  presente deathe refuce not (oh cruell mistres) to do vengaunce vppon hym who is wearye of his life, and receiue at laste this willinge offer, ymportyng two singler commodities, the one a plea∣sure to me to buye thy contētement with ye price of my blod, the other an absolute quiet to thy self in being satiffied wc his death whose lif thou abhorrest, wherin certeinly for my part I am to accompt yt hower most happie, which closyng vp my mortall eyes, doth sounde also the fatall retraict of my longe sorowes, but the chiefest felicity I accompt in this last acte of my life is, that in being so willing to dye by the stroake of thy hande, I shall leaue the to ymagin how ready I was to honor the with the vnfained seruice of my life, the world to giue iudgement of my loyalty, & the gods to take vengaun∣ce of thy cruelitie: yf there be reason in my requeste, why
defarre you thexecutiō, or yf I haue failled in my demande, why staye you to aunswere, it is nowe (alas) that I méete the full of my mishapp, beinge denied both death and life, by her to whom, of al the worlde, I haue most desiered to make declaratiō of obedience in any sorte, what so euer. Alas why staye you to ridd me from tormente, & your selfe out of care to behold any more this desolat knight, who (denied to parti∣cipat other fauor) accomptes it a laste felicitie to giue vp the ghoste in your presence, wherewith fyndinge no remorce of stubborne disdaine in his mistres, who in all this time wold not giue him ye fauor of a simple looke of the eye, & much lesse dispose her selfe to aunswere in any sorte to his cōplaintes, felte suche warr betwene the force of his passion, & debilitye of his sences, beinge voyde of natural strength, that in kis∣sing her foote, he fell into a deadly sowne, pronouncyng only theis wordes with the departure of his breath, ah feble re∣warde of vnfayned loyaltye. Roderico amased no lesse with the tragicall farewell of his frende, then moued with iuste anger againste the vnséemely tyranny of Geniuera, commaunded certeine of his companie to restore the traunce of Diego, and with the reste addressed hym to the mercilesse gentlewoman, whome he threatned in this sorte. If the contynuance of thy crueltye, force me to Roderico threatneth Geniuera. chaunge affection, assure thy selfe (detestable woman and enemye to the vertue of all your secte) thou shalte not escape without the hier of the wronge wherewith thou abuseste the honor whiche is offred the: makes thou suche conscience to yelde compassion or admitt the honeste seruice of so noble a gentleman? as this presented with suche humilitie, that earste (without regarde of honestie or vertue), committed thy selfe and honor (as a fugitiue) to the gouernement of a ronagate straunger? what crueltye can be greater? or by what reason canst thou challenge other amēdes or conside∣ration of the wronge thou hast vniustly conceiued, then an humble prostitutiō with so many teares in token of repen∣tance? And for thy parte, what canste thou desyere more
of this gentleman, thē in forgiuing the falte of thy false cō∣tracte with thy last minion, not only to forbeare to enter in∣to suspiciō touching thy vnsemely ronnyng awaye with an vnknowen villeine, but also crauing the guerdō of his con∣stancie, is at point to sacrafice his life to appaise thy anger, and yeld the contentment, for end, I aduise you to chaunge opiniō, least I cōmitt to as many morsels thy desloial body, as this wofull knight not long since, made bloddie deuision of his vnhappie hawke, the only cause of his presēt distresse, and by your owne folly, ready to giue you a title of the most tyrannouse & arrogant gentlewoman that is, neither haue I begon this enterprise, to leaue it vnperfecte, or giue it ouer, with this successe, wherfore seynge you take pleasure in extremities, I will fede your delite with the offer of loue or death, wherof as I giue you the benefitt of the choice, so I sweare vnto you, by hym that is not ignorante of my in∣tente, that if you refuce the first, you shall not faile in thys place to passe vnder the sentence of the last, wherin my selfe will not feare to discharge thoffice of the fatall minister, in embruyng my handes in the blood of her, whose follie only causeth the death of one of my dearest frendes. Thies threates dismayed nothing the malicious Geniuera, nor abated any parte of her presumptuouse arrogancie, for who had sene the fyerie regardes of her eyes, the knittynge of her browes, whettyng of her teethe, closinge her delicate fingars, withe other braueries excedynge farre the simpli∣citie of suche tender yeres, vnexperienced asyett in thassal∣tes and malice of an aduerse fortune, wolde haue sayed shée hadd rather procured terrour to Roderico, then giuen place to his fearefull offer or somounce of loue or death, defyenge al∣so the rigour of his authoritie with thies tearmes. Lyke as (thowe kaitife knighte sayeth she) he that is once thorough bathed in the suddes of ynnocente blodde, is so fleshed and hardened in villenie, that no acte of detestation seames any synne to hym, So it is no merueile if thowe, whyche haste committed vnnaturall slaughter of one, whose true vertue
exceded the flatterynge fame of thy renowne, and gaue no place to the integretie of life, arte not without feare to committ me to the same guide, leaste in sufferynge me to liue, thou couldest not auoyce the iustice whyche I am to procure vpon the iniury I haue receiued, besides I am here readie to laye my heade vppon the blocke of execution, ra∣ther then to giue the honour of my virginitie to any, seinge the cursed handes haue depriued me of hym to whome bothe the trée and frute dyd only apperteine, neyther do I tremble in the remembrance of the stroke of deathe, howe cruell so euer it appere, for that I shall the rather stande affore the troane from whence is graunted all vengaunce to suche wretches as thou arte: ha God, seing thou arte righteouse why doste thou not thonder iustice vpon the wronge which thies outlawes haue don thy ynnocente hande mayde, Ah traitor Roderico perswade thy selfe that thou canste not of∣fer me so cruell a deathe, as I am moste readye to endure the tormente, hopynge the same shall serue hereafter as the only cause and meane of thindifferent destructiou of thy selfe, and hym, for whom thou trauellest thus in vaine: here her woman and page began to perswade her to pitie on the behalfe of the knighte, that suffred such passion for her sake, with consente to the honeste requestes of Roderico, solici∣tynge her so frankelye towchynge thextremities of theym both, that she entred into tearmes of reprehencion againste their honeste meanynge: will you (saieth she) be eyther en∣chaunted with the fayned teares of this deloyall, who pas∣sioneth hym selfe vppon creditt, or stande in awe of the ty∣rannouse threates of thys morder or whose villanie wyth couered face, hathe taken awaye the lyfe of youre mayster? Ah vnhappye girle that I am, it is nowe alas that I feele the heauie handes of fortune, whose malyce hathe not one∣lye putte me béetwene the handes of hym, whome I hate no lesse, then I haue already experienced his dyssembled loue, but also, in doublynge my mishap, assaileth me with the sinister perswacions of my seruants & cōpaniōs of care, who
ought rather to allowe my resolucion in death, then prefer motion in any sort touchinge my consente to requests of no less corruption, then theim selues be infected, who solicite in so bad a cae, Ah loue, I proue to late alas thinfyde∣lytie of thy promise, fyndinge so bad a recompense, for so du∣tifull obedience, to yelde at thy sommonce, and so slender defence, for suche as commit theim selues faythfullye to the gouernmente of thy lore, why sholde nature be more curius to frame vs of a more delicate molde, tempered with a met∣tel of fragilitie, then careful to leaue vs armour of resistance agaynste thassaltes of fortune? for if I had not had a perle of flattering affection painted in my face, I had not tasted ye beginning of a pleasure, whose dollorous farewell for euer, brings more cause of gréeff, then thapprehencion at the first engendred parfecte contentment, for beinge alas vppon the point to Sipp of the sugred cup, wyth exspectacion to féede of the frute of my pleasant attainte: Lo, how traiterus loue serueth me with dishes of mortal annoye, and in place of the deynties which others finde in the ende of their longe hope, it is I that am presented with the banquet of al bitter con∣fections, which makes me heare resigne and declare my fa∣tal testament vpon thinconstancye of that pleasante follye, whom, as I leaue at libertie to make hys gaine of others, as∣well as he hath dallied with me, so I reioyce in thexchaunge of so great an euil, for so present a consolacion as deathe, in whom I hope to fynd no lesse contentment and quiet, then the other hath assailed me with diuersatie of passion. Retire oh cursed mishap, to thende that dyenge by thy meanes, I may liue without the in thother worlde, wherein place of a thousand annoyes, which (yf I shold consente to longer life) thou hast yet to thonder vpon me, I shalbe sewer of eternall reapose, norished with thinuisible, foode whych god ympar∣tes to hys Angels and soules assistinge his heauēly paradise. Come deathe and do thyne office vpon thys wretched girle, who attendes the sharpnes of thy darte, to preuente the earcinge arrowes of myne aduersarye, Ah poore harte
deuoyde of hope, am desperate touching the consommacion of thy desyers, ceasse hensfurth to wishe the fruytion of lon∣ger tearme, seinge destenie, loue, and lyf, are determined to dysmisse me here hence, to sewe for peace elswhere, and em∣brase the ghost of hym, whose lif was sacrafized to the deloy∣altie of thys wretche, who also for his parte, not satisfyed with the blod of ynnocencye, takes no compassion vpon my teares which I wishe to distyll by suche abundance, that in ouerflowing the vital paxtes in me, he might sée me perishe in his presence, drowned wyth thinundacion of vndeserued sorow, proceding by his wickednes: wherewith her eyes per∣formed her desier with such plentie of teares, that there was not one of the companie voyed of compassion on the hehalfe of the dollor whych tormented her, not ceassing notwithstan¦ding to perswade her to pitie towarde that poore Diego, who beynge newely recouered by the diligence of thassistance, sprinkling fresh water of the fountayne vpon his face, dyd no soner lift vp his sorowfull lyddes, beholdinge the lamen∣table passion of hys mistres, with certeine likelehodes he es∣pied, showing an encrease of her disdayne towardes hym, but he retired to his former debilitie, fallinge downe dead be∣twene the armes of suche as suported hym, and albeit hée was eftsones restored, yet the force of hys passion assailed hym stil wyth thrée or foure mortal panges one in the necke of an other, in such sorte, as the whole company gaue iudg∣ment of hys death, amongest the whych Roderico, was not the leaste amased who greuing indifferently with thobsti∣nate crueltie of Geniuera, and present perill of hys deare frēd Diego, was in long debate what pollecie to vse to qualifie the one, and preuent the daunger of the other, he perswaded, that if he killed the willful Geniuera, he shold also giue ende to the dayes of Diego, for that vpon the viewe and remembrauce of the one, depended the life of the other, and so in doinge no good to any, he sholde commit doble offence to god and the world, both in spottinge his soule with vnciuill morder, and
also to become the author of his death, in whose lyfe he rea∣posed his most worldly felycitie, on thother side, ye vntoward¦nes of the girle argued her intractable in suche sorte as hee desiered, which confirmed the continuall martirdom of hys frend, whose distresse as it moued hym to suche inwarde re∣morce, that to procure his deliuerye he made no conscience to lighte a candle afore the deuill, so, he gaue a newe charge vppon the good will of Geniuera, with gentle perswacions, lainge afore her, what vertue ought to appere in suche ten∣der and delicate yeres, and how greatly the vice of ingrati∣tude defaced the renowme of a gentlewoman assisted wyth crueltie without reason, wherein gaininge no lesse then if he had neuer put the deuise in execution, he retired to thex∣tremitie of his former threates, and last pollecie, swearinge that she shoulde fynde no difference betwene the sommonce and effecte, seing that by her death he should giue ende to her disdayne, and desolate state of hys frende, whom as he doub∣ted not, woulde deserne in tyme, what commoditie it were to purge the ayre of suche contagiouse filthes of ingratefull arrogancie, so he was also of opynion that tyme wold yelde commendacion to his fact, chiefly for that, in preseruinge ye honour of a familie, he thought it more expediente to exter∣minat the two principall offenders, then to reserue the lyfe of eyther of them for an vtter extinction of the glorye of the whole house, wherefore, regarding the rest of his traine, hee commanded to laye handes of the obstinate gentlewoman with her two companions with charge to vse no lesse mer∣cy in their seuerall executions then the chiefeste of the three extended pitie to the amarus knighte whyche he thoughte wold yelde vp the ghost afore her. The Ladye hearinge the sentence diffinitiue of her life, es∣cred the morder with open mouthe, as yf she had exspected some succour to defende her from deathe, wherein her hope was frustrate, for the deserte fostred no other companye but suche as were readye in the place to commit execution. The page and poore Chambriere helde vpp their handes
for mercie to Roderico, who fainyng an ympedimente in hys hearyng, made a signe to his men to put effecte to his com∣mandement. Geniuera, entreating for the liues of her page and woman, desiered that their ynnocentie mighte not do pennance for the offence whych she had don, crauyng with great humilitie that the punishement myght be performed vppon her, frō whom the falte (yf it be a matter meritorious of blame sayeth she for a womā to kepe her fayth to her hus∣bande) is deriued, and yeld iustice to thies infortunat wret∣ches least thexecution of their ynnocenti increase your de∣testable offence, oh saieth she with her handes and eyes be∣holdyng the heauens, thou my most deare and lawfull hus∣bande, whose soule I see walkyng in the middest of the loyal louers, what better proffe canste thou haue of the sinceri∣tie of my loue, then to see me laye my body vppon thalter of ymmolation to vntymely death for thy sake, neyther shalte thou for thy parte, oh boocher and mortall morderour of my carkasse, to whose crueltie my destenie hathe consented in quenching thy thurste with the blodd of a pure mayde, glo∣rifie hereafter to haue forced the harte of a simple gentle∣woman, and muche lesse made a breache into her honor ey∣ther by terrible threates or sugred perswations, vpō which laste wordes notwithstandyng attended suche argumentes of terrour, that a man wolde haue thoughte that the veraye remembrance of death, hadd somewhat quallified her vehe∣mency, and mortified the greatest part of her former furies Geniuera be ginneth to shovve argu∣ments of com¦passion. Dom Diego, by this tyme came to hym selfe and seynge the discourse of the tragedye readye to presente hys laste acte with the death of his faire mistres Geniuera la blonde, was driuen to force hym selfe to speake for the lyfe of her, whose crueltie hadde committed hym allmoste to the panges of extreme daunger, wherefore staynge the diligence of suche as had the charge of execution he addressed hym to Roderico, with this requeste. diego sevveth for the lyf of Geniuera. My lorde and great frende the present experience of your rare frendshypp, hath made so lyberall a prooff of youre
vndoubted meanyng towardes me, that, if I sholde liue the age of a whole worlde I shoulde not be hable to discharge the bondes of your desert, So considering the cause of this misfortune, procedes only of the malice of mine owne de∣stenie, and that it is a vanitie to contende with the thynges which the heauens haue determined vpon vs, I beseche you by the vertue of your honor, & for a confirmation of all the good tornes you haue done me, to graunte me yet one re∣queste, whiche is, that in pardonning the life of this gentle∣woman and her companie, you will retourne theim to the place from whence you broughte theim, with no lesse assu∣raunce and saffetie, then yf you guided your miserable Dom Diego, for my parte, being fullie resolued not to kepe warre with my destenies, I am perswaded to a contentement tou∣chinge my lot, assurynge you, for the reste, that the sorowe whiche I sée she suffreth, giueth me more cause of passion, then ye gréef which I endure by her meanes, troubleth me, let her liue in peace and me in exspectation, to receiue ende of my tormentes by the deuouring knif, which is ordeyned to cut in sonder the fillet whereuppon dependes the fatall course of my cursed yeres, till whiche tyme, I haue sworne to kepe residēce in theis solitarye desertes, aswell to endure the pennance of myne owne indiscretion, as also to conti∣nue in secrett prayer to thalmightye for the continual quiet of her, who may boldly vaunte to be the mistres of the most loyall seruante that euer mente honor or seruice to Ladie. Who doubtes in ye merueilous forces of loue, let him be ab∣solued with this example, seing that as the impressiō (which we cal loue) hath power to bringe to an vnitie the mindes that liued in seperation, make indissoluble peace with the quarells which seame immortall, quallifying the rigour of those hartes, whiche without this passion, no other pollecie could appaise, So when he discouereth, the full perfection of his effectes, he preferres suche a facilitie in thinges whiche earste seamed impossible, that by his onely meane, they be∣come neither dangerous to pursewe, nor harde to obtaine,
whych appered rightly in this younge Lady, in whom as the sinister conceite of a former Ielowsie, her affected zeale con∣tracted to an other, with her iust cause of anger for his death, had engendred a disdayne to Dom Diego, an extreme desier to reuenge her wronge vpon Dom Roderico, and by the same meane to ende her owne lyfe, So loue remouinge the vaile that blinded the eyes of her vnderstandinge, and breakinge thadamante rocke planted in the middeste of her stomake, Her hart brought her in one instante to beholde with open eyes, the constancy, patience and perseuerance of her first and moste loyall seruant, whose last prayer and intercession on her be∣half, stirred vp in her more remorce thē al ye seruices of court or pennance in the painfull wildernes wer hable to prefer, whereof she exposed a present effect, in castinge her armes a bout the necke of the desperat knyght, to whom she forbare no sortes of kisses nor amarus embrasinges, seamynge no lesse passioned wyth ioy and loue on hys behalfe, then earste he seamed plunged in dispair and sorowe, ballancing indiffe∣rently betwene life and death in his presence, neyther was she hable to pronownce any worde vpon the soddayne, tyll (beyng restored to the vse of her tongue) by the discontynu∣ance of her traunce, she excused her former rigour wyth tear¦mes of humylitie, and desyeringe pardon of the follies wher Ge niuea e useth her former faie and fole vvich promise of vnfayned fayth to Diego. wyth she had abused hys patience, offred her selfe hereafter to be the slaue and seruant of hys shadow, takyng thassistāce of thym perfections in loue to be in some sort contrybutarye to her falte, for that (sayth she as loue hathe this vice of na∣ture, that such as accompte theym selues to sée moste cleare are they whych most often commit greatest faltes by igno∣rance, So besydes the confession of the wronge I haue don you so many wayes, Lo I am ready to abide the punishment of your owne iudgemeut, without crauing any dispence of iustice or moderacion of pennance for any respecte of fauor, And albeit (for my parte) I haue not escaped wythout passiō, but yt the stormes of aduersatie which you haue séene me en¦dure, haue driuen me to thuttermost of my patience, yet I

Besydes in theis dis∣courses of loue, th'adulteror is putt in remembrance of his faulte, the morderer séeth the rewarde of his iniquitie, he that yeldes to the sommonce of fowle cōcupiscence is sewer to be touched with the marke of infamie, and suche as pas∣sioneth him selfe vpon creadit, maye beholde heare the méede of his follye, wherein for my parte, as I greue that the worlde (at this presente) swarmeth with so greate a nom∣ber of insensed men, readye to dye for a pleasure of so small momente as the contentemente of the bodie, So I wishe that as in writynge thies tragicall affaires, I haue founde the falte of mine owne life, that also the reste of the young∣linges of our countrey, in reding my indeuor, maye breake the slepe of their longe follye, and retire at laste to amende∣ment of lyfe, leaste in remeyninge still in the laborinth of sensuallitie, they serue not hereafter as a fable and stage playe to the posteritye of a multitude, for ende, I ex∣specte no other hier of my traueile, then that my diligence maye seame thankefull to her, to whose honor and goodnesse I owe no lesse then all that I haue.
