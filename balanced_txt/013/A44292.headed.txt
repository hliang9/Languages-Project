Honest Patriot▪ A SHORT DISCOURSE Touching the POLEMICAL SWORD; And of the command in chief of The Militia. London, Printed by J. G. 1659.
Touching the POLEMICAL SVVORD, And command in chief of The MILITIA, &c. GOVERNMENT is an Or∣dinance of God for Mans good; the kinds of Government are ordinances of men for Gods Glory: Now, among all Worldly affairs there is not any thing so diffi∣cult, and fuller or incertitudes as the Art of Government, (Hominem Homini Imperare dif∣ficilimum;) And those nimble spirits who from Apprentices have been bred up jour∣neymen, and at last thought themselves Ma∣sters in this Art, having spent their Youth,
their Manhood, and a long time of old Age therein, yet when they came to leave the World they professe themselves still to be but Novices in the Trade. There is a cer∣tain way to break, guide, and keep in awe all other Animals, though never so savage and strong; but there is no such certain way to govern multitudes of men, in regard of such turbulences of spirit and diversity of opinions that proceed from the Rational Fa∣culty, which other cretures that are content∣ed onely with sense, are not subject unto; and this the Philosopher holds to be one of the inconveniences that attend humane rea∣son, and why it is given man as part of his punishment. Now, why the Government over men is so difficult, there may be two main reasons alledg'd, The First is the various Events, and World of inexpected contingencies that attend humane negotiations, specially matters of State, which as all other subluna∣ry things are subjects to alterations, miscarria∣ges, and change, this makes the mindes of men, and consequently the moulds of policy so often to alter, scarce one amongst twenty
is the same man as he was twenty years ago in point of judgment which turns and chan∣geth according to the success and circum∣stances of things, The wisedom of one day is the foolishness of another, Posterior Dies est prioris Magister, the Day following be∣comes the former dayes Teacher. The Second Reson is, the discrepant, and wavering fancies of mens braines, specially of the common peeple, who (if not restrain∣ed) are subject to so may crotchets and chymeras with extravagant wanton desires, and gaping, after innovations. Insulary peeple are observed to be more transported with this instability then those of the Continent, and the Inhabitants of this Ile more then o∣thers, being a stout spritefull peeple. In so much, that it is grown a Proverb abroad, that The Englishman doth not know when he is well: Now the true Polititian doth use to fit his Government to the fancy of the peeple, The Ruler must do as the Rider, some pee∣ple are to be rid with strong bitts and curbs, and martingalls as the Napoliatan and French our next neighbour, which is the cause that a kind of slavery is entail'd upon him, for the
French Peasant is born with chains; Other Nations may be rid with agentle smal bridle, as the Venetian and the Hollander, who hath not such boiling spirits as others, but may be sayed to be so still as if butter-milk did run in his veins insteed of bloud; a bridle doth serve also the Spaniard, who is the gretest example of stabiliy, and exact obedience to authority, of any peeple; for though Spain be the hottest Countrey in Christen∣dom, yet it is not so subject to Feavers as others are, I mean to fits of intestin commo∣tions: And this was never so much tryed as of late yeers; for though the present King hath such known frailties, though he hath bin so infortunate, as to have many Coun∣treys quite revolted, and rent away from him; though the ragingst Plague that ever was in Spain under any King, happen'd of late yeers, which sweep'd away such a world of peeple; though his Taxes be higher then ever were any, though he hath call'd in and engrossed all the common coyn of the Countrey, and delivered but the one half back again; though there's no legal Instru∣ment no Bond, Bill, or Specialty can be writ but upon his seal'd paper, with sundry
other exactions, yet his subjects are still as obedient, and awful unto him, they are as conformable and quiet, as if he were the most vertuous, and victorious Prince that ever was; and this they do principally for their own advantage, for if there were ano∣ther Governour set up, it would inevira∣bly hurle the whole Countrey into combu∣stion and tumults; besides, they are taught, that as in choice of Wives, so the Rule holds in Governments, Seldome comes a better. Touching the Originals of Government and ruling power, questionless the first a∣mong Mankind was that Naturall power of the Father over his Children, and that Despotical domestique surintendence of a Master of a house over his Family; But the World multiplying to such, a Masse of peeple, they found that a confused equality, and a loose unbridled way of living like brute animals to be so incon∣venient, that they chose one person to protect and govern; not so much out of love to the person, as for their own con∣veniency and advantage, that they might
live more regularly, and be secur'd from rapine, and oppression; As also that justice might be administred; and every one en∣joy his own without fear, and danger: such Governours had a power invested ac∣cordingly in them, and to appoint sub∣servient, able Ministers under them to help to bear the burden. Concerning the kinds of Government, all Polititians agree that Monarchall is the best and noblest sort of sway having the neerest analogy with that of Heven, viz. A supreme power in one single per∣son, God Almighty is the God of Unity, as well as of Entity, and all things that have an Entity do naturally propend to Unity; Unity is as necessary for a well-being, as Entity is for a Being, for no∣thing conduceth more to order, tranquil∣lity, and quietude, nor is any strength so operative as the united; The fist is stronger then the hand, though it be nothing but the hand; viz. The fingers united by contraction; The Republick of Venice which is accounted the most Eagle-ey'd and lastingst State in the World, for she
hath continued a pure Virgin, and shin'd within her watry Orb nere upon thirteen Ages, is the fittest to give the World advice herein, for if ever any have brought policy to be a Science which consists of cer∣titudes this State is Shee, who is grown as dexterous in ruling men as in rowing of a Gally. But whereas the vulgar opi∣nion is, that the common peeple there have a share in the Government, 'tis nothing so, for her Great Counsel which is the main hinge whereon the Republick turns, is composed onely of Gentlemen who are capable by their birth to sit there, having passed twenty five yeers of age; To which purpose they must bring a publick Testi∣monial that they are descended of a Patri∣cian or noble Family. But to return to the main matter, this sage Republick who may prescribe rules of Policy to all Man∣kind, having tried at first to Govern by Consuls and Tribunes for some yeers, she found it at last a great inconvenience, or de∣formity rather, to have two heads upon one body; Therefore Shee did set up one Soveraign Prince; and in the Records of Ve∣nice the resons are yet extant which induc'd
her thereunto, whereof one of the remark∣ablest was this; We have observed that in this vast University of the World all Bodies according to their several Natures have mul∣tiplicity of Motions, yet they receive vertue, and vigour but from one, which is the Sun; All causes derive their Originals from one supreme cause; wee see that in one Creture there are many differing Members, and Faculties which have various functions, yet they are all guided by one soul, &c. The Iland of Great Britain hath bin alwayes a Royal Ile from her first crea∣tion, and Infancy; She may be say'd to have worn a Crown in her Cradle; and though She had so many revolutions, and changes of Masters, yet She con∣tinued still Royal; nor is there any spe∣cies of Government that suits better, either with the quality of the Coun∣trey, and Genius of the Inhabitants, or relates more directly to all the anci∣ent Lawes, Constitutions, and Customes of the Land, then Monarchal; which any one that is conversant in the Old Records can justifie; Britannia ab initio mundi sem∣per
Regia, & regimen illius simile illi caelo∣rum. Concerning the many sorts of Trusts which were put in the Supreme Gover∣nor of this Land (for there must be an implicite and unavoidable necessary trust reposed in every Soveraign Magistrate) the power of the Sword, was the chief∣est; and it was agreeable to Holy Scri∣pture he should have it, where we know 'tis said, The King beareth not the Sword in vain; The Lawes of England did ever allow it to be the inalienable pre∣rogative of the Soveraign Prince, nor was it ever known (humbly under fa∣vour) that any other power whatsoe∣ver managing conjunctly or singly, did ever pretend to the power of the publick Sword, or have the Militia invested in them, but this ever remained intire and untransferrible in the person of the Ru∣ler in chief, whose chiefest instrument to govern by, is the Sword, without which Crownes, Scepters, Globes and Maces are but bables. It is that Instru∣ment which causeth true Obedience, makes
him a Dread Soveraign, and to be fear∣ed at home and abroad; Now 'tis a Maxime in policy, that there can be no true obedience without Fear; The Crown and Scepter draw onely a loose kinde of voluntary love, and opinion from the peeple, but 'tis the sword that drawes Reverence and awe, which two are the chiefest ingredients of Allegeance, it be∣ing a principle, that the best Govern∣ment is made of Fear and Love, viz. when by Fear Love is drawn as threed through the eye of a Needle; The su∣rest Obedience, and Loyalty is caused thus, for Fear being the wakefullest of our passions works more powerfully in us and predominates over all the rest; Pri∣mus in orbe Deos fecit Timor. To raise up a Soveraign Magistrate without giving him the power of the Sword, is to set one up to rule and metall'd Horse without a Bridle; A chief Rule without a Sword, may be said to be like that Logg of Wood which Jupiter threw down among the Froggs to be their King, as it is in the Fable. Moreover, One of the chief∣est glories of a Nation is to have their
Supreme. Governor to be esteemed, and redoubted abroad as well as at home; and what Forraign Nation will do either to the chief Governor of England if he be armless, and without a sword? who will give any respect or precedence to his Ambassadors, and Ministers of State? The Sword also is the prime Instru∣ment of publick Protection, therefore that Governor who hath not the power of the Sword, must have another Title given him then Protector: Nor indeed can any Soveraign Governor part with his Sword, or transfer the power there∣of to others, for that were to betray his duty and desert the protection of his Peeple. Thus it appears that nothing condu∣ceth more to the honor, and indeed the essence of a Supreme Governor then the power, and mannagement of the Sword; There's none so simple as to think there's meant hereby an ordinary single sword such as every common Souldier carrieth by his side, No, 'tis the Polemical pub∣lick Sword of the whole Countrey, 'tis
an aggregative compounded Sword; and 'tis moulded of Bell-metall, for 'tis made up of all the Ammunition and Arms, of all the Military strength of all the Forts, Castles, and Tenable places within, and without the whole Ile. The Soveraigne Princes of England have had this Sword by vertue of their Royal Signiory from all times, the Lawes did gird it to their sides, they imployed it not onely to dubb Knights, and con∣ferr honors, but to repell all forraign force, to revenge all hostile injuries, and affronts, to quell all civill tumults, and to protect the weal of the whole Body Politick; The Peeple were never capable to have the power of this Sword, the fundamentall constitutions of England deny it them, 'tis all one to put a sword in a Mad-mans hands as the Peeples. The Civilians, who are not in all points so great friends to Monarchy as the Common-Law of England, do allow Six Regalia's to a Supreme Magistrate:
VIZ. 1. Armamenta; All kind of Arming; 2. Potestas Judicatoria; Power of Judicature; 3. Potestas Vitae & Necis; Power of Life and Death; 4. Bona Adespota; Masterless Goods; 5 Census; Sessements and Publick Ta∣xations. 6. Monetarum valor; The value, and coyning of Money.
Among these Regalia's we find that Arming, which in effect is nothing else but the Military power, and publick Sword of a Countrey, marcheth with the formost. But some alledge that 'tis fitting the Chief Magistrate should be so qualifi∣ed restrained, and limited that the Peeple may not have cause to fear him, which must be if he have the power of the Sword; Under favour, this is point blank against the rules of true Policy, for if he be not feared, he will not be long obey'd, the truest Obedi∣ence, as it was touch'd before, being bred of Fear and Awe; Among other attributes which the Parliaments gave Henry the Eighth, One was Metuendis∣simus ille Monarcha; The most feared, or redoubted Monarch, and it was al∣wayes the stile that the Lawes of Eng∣land gave their ruling Prince, Most dread Soveraign. I will conclude this short Discourse (which the Author most humbly submits to the Higher Powers) with an old Egyptian Fable
which is not much impertinent to this purpose. Vpon a time the Flowers assembled, and met in one generall Councell, by the authority and summons of the Rose, who hath been ever esteemed the Prince of Flowers by a speciall Decree of Nature; many Debates, and bandings of Opinions happend in this Assembly, and among other good morrowes, it was propounded to the Rose whom they acknowledged their Prince, that he would part with his prickles, and transmit his strength that way, to them to be disposed of; The Rose made them this answer, The prickles which God, and Nature hath given me, are inherent in me from the Creation, and though they be but Excrescencies, yet you know they fortifie and arm me; Armat Spina Rosam, and by them, protect you, and yours from violence, and what protection, I pray, can there be with∣out Arms?
Therefore I would be loath to part with them to enervate, and weaken my strength, for that were to betray my trust, and desert the protection of you. Nor do I much value what that silly inse∣cted animal the King of Bees tells me som∣times, when humming up and down my leafs he would buzze this fond belief into me, how it added much to his Ma∣jesty that Nature gives him no sting as all other Bees have, because he should relie alltogether upon the love and loyalty of his Subjects; No, I will take warning by the Eagle the Prince of Volatills, and by the Lion the Prince of Quadrupedalls, who when by fair insinuations the one had parted with his tallons, the other with his teeth and ongles, wherein their might, and consequently their Majesty consisted, grew afterwards contemptible to all Cretures, and quite lost that obedience and awe which was due unto the one from all Volatills, and to the other from all Quadrupedalls.
The Morall and mythologicall sense of this Fable, with the applicati∣ons thereof is obvious, and easie to any indifferent Capacity. FINIS.
