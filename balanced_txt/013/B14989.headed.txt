Secondly / a ge∣neral pardon and remission. Thirdly / that into their Countrey there should not be brought men of warre. For this they offer and have presented to receive his Majestie / whereupon this resolu∣tion is taken: that notwithstanding they first where not worthy / neverthelesse it should be graunted unto them / if they should shew them∣selves obedient / those that have beene cause / his Majestie will not pardon / but shall be punished to an exampel of others. The men of warre should be brought into the Countrey / but none should suffer damage / but those that should withstand. Whereupon some of the States and Communs have declared themselves / but others would not trust to it / and are departed till a sure pardon be given / and therefore the whole armey is lying in Moravia / to consrayne the rebelles to obedience / and march to Brin / but some saye that 15 thousand men of warre expeet them the∣re.
