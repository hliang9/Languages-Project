A Looking-Glasse for Statesmen, Wherein they may clearely see the reward of their severall Actings. a group of men, labelled Daniell, Moses, Joseph, Sidrack, Meshack, Abednego, Mordecai, and Nehemia two arms appearing out of the clouds יהוה five men, each being executed in a different way, labelled Haman, Saull, Strauford, Achitophel, and Laud THe several Actings of men when formed, proceed from one of these two Principles; either from Divine Wisdome, or Humane Prudence, and sometimes from both: Now when Divine Wisdome doth act singly, and alone, it oftentimes (by the Prudentiall) is judged weaknes or folly, but the conclusion is alwayes in Honour, Peace, and Safety: Humane Prudence, when it relateth simply to the Actor, and not to the prejudice of another, is of great use to the owner; as when to eat, when to drink, to worke, to sleep, to wake, to buy, to sell, to marry, or give in marriage: in any of these, or the like, it is an ornament of great price, when rightly mannaged: But when it layes about it to com∣passe designes for it selfe, that tendeth to the hurt of another, it proveth most pernicious and destructive unto the Actor, to whom it promiseth great honour, and full content∣: As by these following examples on your right hand, doth manifestly appeare. e lascivious Courtier doth laugh at the sillie chastity of Joseph, (as he accounts it) to re∣se such a favour from his Mistresse as he did, but being only acted by Divine Wisdome, conclusion be a sufficient ground for us to beware how we trespass upon divine Justice. MOses had little reason to slight such an Inheritance as the Crown of Egypt, for a re∣version of Honour, amongst poor Captive Bondmen. DAniel might very prudently have shut his Windowes, and so have saved himselfe from the Lyons Denne. MOrdecai might have allowed Haman his Negative Voice in State businesse, and cut him a Congee with a bended Knee, rather then expose himselfe, and the Nation to a Halter. Hidrach, Meshack, and Abednego, might have clawed the King by the Elbow, and have told him that he was Supream Head and Governour, over all Persons, and all Causes, might by his Prerogative frame them any Religion to worship God by; and not have expo-themselves to the fury of the Furnace. NEhemiah might have Voted as the Courtiers did, and needed not to have lookt thinne upon the matter, because his Bretheren were not fully delivered from their thraldom, r being in favour with the King, he might easily have gotten twenty hundred pounds a yeare  Him, and His Heires for ever, and suffered the Poor Commons to shift for themselves. ONe President more, but of a different kind, that in this acted by Humane Prudence, and is proper to be rancked in the other Page; but that his Motto is, Neverthelesse his heart is upright in all things, save in the matter of Ʋriah: DAVID, when he had commit∣ folly with Vriah's wife, to cover his basenes, began to act prudentially; and therefore sent Vriah to come to Court, where he is kindly entertained, and made much of; and seeing his ary March will not prevaile with him to be a Cloake to the Design in hand, it is likely that od Liquor will enliven his Spirits to be Cornuted: But seeing this will not take; Prudence rcheth forth unto bloud, and Ʋriah is slain: Now David acts to some purpose: A great urning is celebrated for worthy Vriah; and because his lame Soldiers should not beg in the ts, nor the Widowes of the slain Commanders wait at the Parliament dore for reliefe; s sent for and made his wife: And that his great love unto Vriah might more clearly ap∣ see, how he that formerly had slain a Beare, and a Lyon, is worse then either, unto the nites, who it is probable had Artickled with Joab for the surrender of the City upon  yet because they had slain in Battel, a valliant Captain whom he so dearely loved, they e of unheard of cruelty in cold blood. Now see what followes: The next newes we of, Amnon his son, defileth Tamar his sister; Absolom his darling son, murthers his bro∣ Amnon: A spirit of Stupidity possessed David, so that Justice is neglected, and having g Guard thought himselfe secure: Absolom hath gotten the Throne: When restored, k in Battell that Abishai must sucour him: His Bed was turned into a quagmire; the n his Bones made him roare; his moysture was like the Drought in Summer, and being ty yeares old must have a Virgin to keep him warm: A dear bought Bargain. No n will by Humane Prudence be advised to shunne shame at so deare a rate; for had ure mercies of God extended unto David, and kept him, he might have perished, as WHen King Saul was dethroned by Samuel, and David his Son in law was exalted, he might have had honourable quarter from him during his life; for David thought it honour enough to be his Armour-bearer, and take Orders from him: But when the women in their Songs gave David their prayses ten for one, then Saul beginnes to Act prudentially: Nothing will satisfy blood-thirsty Saul, but the life of David, though sometime his integrity did force from him an abundance of hipocriticall teares: but note his conclusion. A Chitophel was in his Generation never accounted of as a Fool, or a Thin-Pate, but tis said of him, that his Councels were so infallible, as the Oracles of God; and therefore sayes David, Except thou go back, and destroy the good councel of Achitophei we cannot be safe: And you may see, had it been followed, how dangerous it was. Now this man, so infallibly wise, and also a professor formerly of Godliness, as David witness∣eth, We took sweet councel together in the House of God, we eat bread as familiar friends, that thou shuldest lift up the Heel against me, is intolerable: That this man, so qualli∣fyed, should by Humane Prudence put in for a share in so horrid a Treachery, and for∣get so good a Master, in giving such dangerous councell, and taking up such bloody re∣solutions against the person of his Lord; were it recorded in prophane history, would hardly be beleeved; but behold his Figure: he had so much honesty left him, as to save the Hangman a labour. HAman came short of no man in his time, but the King only: He wanted neither power, wealth, favour, nor councel, to accomplish his designes, and compleat his Honour but only to supple the Sinewes of Mordecaies stiffe knees, which would not bend before him: He now consults with his Councel how to quit himselfe of the whole Rabble of those Agitating Jewes: marke well the end of his Tragedy. LAud, we well remember was on his Mountain so strong, that he was in his thoughts unmoveable; and up make himselfe sure, sent the Drmer to Tyburn; but before the flesh was off his Bones, himselfe had a receipt from the same Chirurgion. UNmoveable Strafford, who wanted nothing to secure greatnes, but goodnes, was unexpectedly thrown off his mountain, notwithstanding his Martiall power over the lives of men that stood in his way. THese few examples I have drawn forth before your view (honourable Statesmen) And if you thinke it Wisdome to trade in Humane Prudence, to the prejudice of o∣thers, the best pennieworth that you can expect in this Market, you may find in David; and if you like it, much good do you: but unlesse with him you water your Couch with Teares, your portion is in this Page. For here stands the Case: when men have formed an Action, that will not hold weight at the Beame of Justice; Divine Wisdome being the Judge, if the action relate unto the prejudice of another, Divine Vengeance sendeth its Warrant unto Divine Justice, to Attach the person Delinquent, and no Baile to be taken, but an Eye for an Eye, a Tooth for a Tooth, and he that sheddeth mans blood by colour of Law, as did Ahab by the councell of Jezabel, and Laud in our dayes, shall surely speed as they did: And say not in your selves wee see their errours and will shunne them, by standing on their shoulders, (so you may now their Heads are off) and we will accom∣plish our designes we have projected: Be not deceived ye great Ones, whom God beholds, God is not mocked, look what you sow in the Furrowes of Iniquity, you shall be sure to reap in the Crop of Ʋanity: But if you Plow by the Rule of Divine Wisdome and Ju∣stice, you shall reap Honour and Peace that is immortall, immutable, and glorious: There∣fore cease to do evil, learn to do well, seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fa∣therlesse,, plead for the Widow, set the Prisoner free, and then you shall not have cause to feare the face of man, or dread the mallice of your adversaries.
