An Epistle of Consolation from the fresh Springs of Life, and flowings forth of the Fathers Love (through his Servant) as a tender Salutation extended to the whole Flock and Family of God; even to the lowest of his Babes and Servants, whose hearts are sincere and tender towards him: For their encouragement now in these Suffering and Trying times. By G. W. O My dear and tenderly beloved Friends, Brethren, and Si∣sters, from the greatest to the least in my Fathers family, who are raised up by the power of an endless life, and be∣gotten by the word of truth and life into a living faith and confidence in him who is our Rock and Refuge in all tryals, afflictions, and suf∣ferings which we are exposed to, and undergo for the testimony of Righteousness and a good Conscience; unto you, even unto you who are partakers of this heavenly Calling, and whose hearts accor∣dingly are set with a holy Resolution for the glory and honour of our God therein, is my heart filled with love unutterable, which ari∣seth from the fresh Springs of Life and Consolation made manifest from a living experience of the effectual power and work of God which hath given access into a heavenly habitation and Sanctuary wherein his presence is enjoyed, in which the fulness of Consolation and Joy resideth for the Righteous, and all such as wait upon the Lord our God in his own eernal spirit of life and holiness, whose delight is to dwell with him in his Mansion-house, which we have access into through the new and living way, which in the everlast∣ing and unspeakable love of God in his own Son is now made ma∣nifest, and the many veils seen thorow, by which this way and ha∣bitation was hid from us, whilst our minds were alienated from the loe and everlasting light of the Lord God and his Christ; but now therein is life and Salvation brought forth and come near to many, whose hearts are enclined towards him, and set to seek the fountain of life: And it is not the power of darkness, nor the enmity of the Serpent or old Dragon, nor the dark wrath of man that shall be able to hinder, obstruct, or frustrate the Lord God in his proceeding in this his great work of Righteousness, which by his mighty arm and power he will carry on and prosper, to the perfecting his own praise in his people, and as he hath glorified his everlasting name, and
Crowned his own seed with glory, victory, and tryumph thorow sufferings and tribulations, (which glory and victory many in their own particulars are partakers of) so he will glorifie and renown his name and seed thorow those tryals and sufferings, which yet remain to be fulfilled amongst his faithful witnessess, servants, and people who are called, and chosen, and faithful, being endued with the spi∣rit, nature, and properties of his Elect seed in which his soul delight∣eth, and with whom the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper, and which shall out live the enmity, and Reign over its Adversaries and Oppressors, though they (for a time) be permitted to appear with a high hand, and the wicked so highly to lift their horns up against the seed of the Righteous; and to attempt the rooting out of the faithful from amongst men; yet we have no cause (in any of these things) to distrust the Lord, or to be weakened in our confidence which he hath raised up in us; for he is with us who is mighty to save, and his care, mercy, and tenderness is felt towards all that tru∣ly fear him, and obey his voice; and of this I am a living witness, who from time to time upon the weighty consideration, and feeling of the goodness of our God, and largeness of his love to his people, have been and am filled with the sense of his presence and unspeak∣able glory over all that which would oppress or hurt, which cannot enter into the holy Mountain, and in that glory and life received, is my heart and bowels of tender love enlarged towards all the up∣right in heart, who are come of a holy right seed, ad sprung forth from a noble Vine, and not only so, but in hoy confidence, and stedfast Resolution, are given up in the spirit of life, wisdom, and power, and of the fear of the Lord, to follow him in the faith, pa∣tience, and suffering of his own faithful and Elect seed, which you that abide in, shall never degenerate from the nature and innocen∣cy thereof, but know your victory and dominion therein over death and hell, where the gates threeof shall never be suffered to prevail against you; for as in the faith and obedience you are given up in his will who hath called you, your habitation and securi∣ty stands in his name and power, to which the Righteous flie and re∣tire in all their troubles and tribulatios, which though they be ma∣ny, yet so many deliverances do they meet withall at his hand, who is our Rock and Refuge, whose Salvation becomes as Walls and Bulwarks for the faithful.
Oh my dear Friends both in the City of London, Bristol, Hartford, Reading, Colchester, and elsewhere in this Nation of England, who for the tryal and exercise of your faith and patience thorow many tribulations and sufferings, and who more particularly at this day and time are under a deep tryal and exercise, [the power of dark∣ness and its Instruments being permitted to afflict you, and to break your harmless and innocent Meetings, and to hurry many of you into holes and prisons,] and yet you retain so much tenderness in your spirits towards God▪ and respect to his testimony and cause, that you dare not deny him, but must confess him and his truth and righteous testimony and worship before men, and for that cause have given your backs to the smiters, and exposed your selves to undergo the deep sufferings or penalties, that men may be permit∣ted to inflict upon you; and even to give up your lives for a prey, rather then the name of the Lord should be dishonoured by you; Oh dear hearts hold fast your confidence and resolution in the name and power of the everlasting Jehovah, in whom is your strength and safety, and keep within, and be retired in your minds when temptations or any discouragements would enter you to weaken any of your faith, for in the light and power of the God of Jacob, a safe habitation is known, out of, and above all the troubles of the world, and the persecutions that we meet with in it, and in the se∣cret pavilion of the Almighty, and hiding places of the Lord, the oppressed that wait upon him find a Refuge in the time of trouble, and therein do see over all the blackness and darkness which hath covered the Earth, in which the enmity worketh against the righ∣teous seed, and do know a sweet repose in their deepest sufferings and tryals, and that Well-Spring of life is set open in them, which makes all easie to them, and sanctifies every state and condition of what tryal or exercise soever they meet with for the name of God or his testimony; and herein joy, and peace, and everlasting glory and triumph is seen and felt by all the faithful and sincere in heart over all their oppressors. And that all you sincere hearted and tender Friends, whose eyes are turned towards your maker, and whose faces are set Sion-ward may be so retire in your minds to the principle of truth, and so watchful in the light of the Lord, and to enjoy a peaceable habita∣tion and sanctuary in him in all your sufferings, for this hath my
soul travelled, waited, and breathed unto the God of my life and Salvation, and that you all may feel your establishment and securi∣ty in the life and Covenant of the everlasting God, and in the en∣joyment of the true Communion and fellowship of the everlasting Gospel, wherein every member of the body in that Communion doth partake of the living bread in the Fathers Mansion-house, and therein become one bread to the strengthning, refreshing, conso∣lating, and building up of one another in the most holy faith, which worketh by love, and which edifies the whole body throughout, which all that come truly to partake of and enjoy, 'tis neither per∣secutions, nor tribulations, nor principalities, nor powers, nor thrones, nor dominions, that shall be able to separate them from the love of God in Christ; neither shall any Rent or Schism come within that bond of love or bundle of life, wherewith such are bound up together; for they are such as have overcome by faith and patience, and have offered up all to the will of him that hath called them, and their name shall not be blotted out of the Book of Life, but be confessed before the heavenly father and his Angels, in as much as they have confessed him and his Son, and held forth his testi∣mony, and not been ashamed thereof before men: And these are they that are so nearly related unto God in his own likeness and heaven∣ly Image, that they are his chosen▪ refined, and precious Jewels, never to be forgotten by him, nor separate from him, for they are as the Apple of his eye, and engraven in the Palms of his hands; and such a Remnant our God certainly hath in this Nation, in whom I have seen that which my soul hath travelled for, and which hath been to my souls satisfaction, and as one having largely felt the Lords presence, and still feeling the enjoyment of the same, and his glory to be the Reward, as it is to those that minister re∣lief to the oppressed, and bread to the hungry, for which many can bless the Lord on our behalf I find the same living faith and confi∣dence remaining in me, in behalf of the work of the Lord, and the prosperity thereof as ever; and this is the work that he hath made me and others of his faithful servants instruments in, which is so far brought to pass and effected by his mighty power, as all the powers of darkness hell, and death, shall never be able to undoe it, nor all the storms, tryals, or oppositions that ever we meet withall shall ever be able to disanull it, or put a stop to it; for it shall prosper
over the heads of all the adversaries and oppressers of the righteous seed; and that testimony which we have stood up for in this Nation shall never be extinguished, but be had in everlasting remembrance; and this hath the Lord sealed and confirmed unto my soul, so as its neither imprisonment, nor exilement, nor death it self that I look out at; but as to what the Lord may suffer in these things I commit to him, as knowing a life in that faith that sees to the end of these things, and beyond the wrath of man and enmity of the wic∣ked, which so highly is at work in our dayes, as had not the Lord in a great measure put a limit and restraint thereto it would have ex∣tended to the taking away many of our lives, not onely by that covertly way of hard imprisonment, and lingering martyrdome therein, but also by speedy execution under pretence and colour of legal proceeding or justice (so called) on the persecutors part; and how far yet the Lord may suffer the enmity to proceed in that case against any of us, his will be done; and that I commit unto him who is the wise God as not being careful in it: but thus far I can say, That we must be willing to offer up our selves unto the deepest and utmost tryals, as required therein, to hold forth our testimony for our further manifestation, and both the righteous and the wicked shall be tryed in their way, and our God hath raised up a remnant whom he hath prepared and fitted to try those weapons and unrighteous decrees that are formed against the righteous seed, and they shall be tryed to the utmost, and broken thorow; for no weapon formed against Zion shall prosper, because the righteousness of her children is of the Lord, who must have the glory in the deliverance of his own seed, and in the removing the rod of the oppressor, and breaking asunder the bands and cords of the wicked, who have taken counsel together against him and his anointed, whom he that sitteth in the heavens hath in derision in all their high and proud attempts against him and his seed, and their unrighteous designs and consultations, which would debar his an∣nointed of his liberty in his people and followers; but the King of Zion is set upon his holy hill, who shall rule nations with a rod of iron, and break them as the vessels of a potter; for power shall be given him over the Nations, and he shall lay Babylon utterly waste, and her noise, musick, pomp, and vain glory shall cease, in which she hath rejoyced over the Saints and true witnesses, and followers
of the Lamb, and the slain in her the earth shall not cover, but dis∣close her blood, when the indignation of the Lord breaks forth, and his vials of wrath comes to be emptied by his Angels, and execu∣tioners of justice upon the seat of the Beast (that hath upheld Baby∣lon in her abominations, and them that have taken part with, and followed the Beast) and persecuting spirit. And our God is the same that ever he was to his own, and his pro∣mises fail not, but are now a fulfilling: And therefore O thou seed of Jacob, and off-spring of Israel, whom God hath chosen, fear thou not, nor be dismaid, for I am with thee, saith the Lord; I will strengthen thee, and help, and uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness, and all they that are insenced against thee, and they that strive with thee shall be ashamed and confounded, and shall be as nothing yea, they shall perish that war against thee: fear not thou worm Jacob; but arise in the power of the holy one; for to thee it is given to thresh the mountains, with thy sharp thresh∣ing instrument, and to beat them small, and to make the hills as chaff, and thou shalt rejoyce in the Lord; and those that come of thee shal take root, and Israel which prevaileth with God shall blossom, and bud, and fill the face of the world with fruit, and I will be as the dew unto him; he shall grow as the Lilly, and cast forth his roots as Lebanon, saith the Lord: What though if men be suffered to persecute, hurry about, exile, transport or transplant any of us who are of this seed; yet they cannot hinder this from grow∣ing, nor the branches thereof from spreading over Nations and Kingdoms, because our God hath caused, and will yet cause his own seed to take deep root among nations and people, and will root out the uncircumcised before his plant. And thou, O Zion, and Church of the living God and suffering seed, who hast laid thy body as the ground, and as the street to them that went over, that thou mightest keep thy conscience clear, and not bow down thy soul for thy enemies to go over it; the Lord thy God that pleadeth the cause of his people, will give the cup of trem∣bling and fury which thou hast drunk of into the hand of them that afflict thee; therefore put on strength and courage in the Lord thy God, and shine forth in thy brightness and beauty; for he is with thee▪ who hath laid thy foundations with Saphires, and thy stones with fair colours, and he will adorne thy dwelling, and beautifie thy
scituation, as with the most precious and pleasant stones, though thou hast been as one afflicted and tossed with tempests and troubles within and without, and whosoever shall gather together against thee shall fall for thy sake, and the gathering of the people, and the fulness of the Gentiles shall be unto thee, and the sons of them that afflicted thee, and all them that have despised thee shall bow and bend before thee. O my dear friends who are come to a living faith concerning these things, and to know that seed, in which all the promises of God are, yea, and Amen, dwell and abide therein; and as you are called to bear a publick testimony for God, in order to the gathering of many unto the covenant of promise; so be faithful in holding forth that testimony, though for it many be called to suffer in this day of try∣al, and to offer up all for the sake thereof; yet the Lord being with us let us go on in his name, and by him make mention thereof, and vindicate his worship in spirit and truth▪ which we suffer for, and in the power, authority, and counsel of God stand up for our just li∣berty therein before our persecutors, and Judges, when we are cal∣led before them, and in the weighty and feeling spirit of life, Friends to endeavour (when called before their oppressors) to fasten some∣thing upon their consciences, for the innocency of our Cause, and when any of them are tryed in order to banishment, (or the like) that they may be so kept in the fear and counsel of God, having their spirits seasoned with his life, as they may be manifest in the consciences of both their persecutors and spectators; and that it may be apparent that friends are in the name of the Lord, which is above every earthly name (how great soever) and that in this name of our God we walk and suffer for obeying him, and assembling together singly and innocently in his way and worship, and suffer upon an innocent and conscientious account whatever otherwise men unrighteously pretend against us; and this our suffering shall preach, and the Gospel of the Kingdom shall there thorow be wit∣nessed and sounded forth to the gathering in of many into the love of that truth which we have received, though some that are unfaith∣ful, and such as back-slide in heart shall be scattered and blown a∣way with the storm; but the faithful and upright, whose hearts are perfect towards God, he will shew himself strong on their behalf; and they that follow the Lamb whithersoever he goes, who through
great tribulation have their garments washed in his Blood, and who abide in the Temple and habitation of the living God, serving him continually therein, the storm shall not be suffered to remove them, nor the heat to scorch them, but under the shadow of their souls beloved they shall sit down in peace, and the Lamb shall feed them, and lead them unto the fountains of waters; even so the Lord God encompass all you his dear babes and spiritual off-sprng with the arme of power, and make you as a waered Garden, and surround you within the bounds of his salvation, and confound your enemies, and make their evil designs and intentions void and frustrate, that he alone may have the glory and preheminence amongst his people in this his day. From your dear brother and fellow sufferer who travels in spirit and waits in patience with the suffering seed for Sions deliverance out of all her troubles, and renwn over all her enemies. G. W. W. M. Written in the White Lion Pri∣son, London. the 23d. of the 7th. Moneth, 1664. The End.
