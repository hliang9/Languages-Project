Loyalty Vindicated FROM THE Calumnies cast upon it by Richard Janeway in his Im-Partial Mercury. In a LETTER from an Ap∣prentice of London to a Worthy Citizen. SIR, IT is no less Common than True, that desperate Diseases must have desperate Cures, and that ill-minded and malicious men will not leave any Stone unturned to gain their wisht-for ends; let the Design be but propitious to their Cause, they never stand to parley about its honesty, but wrong or right resolve to attempt it; and accor∣ding to this Verse, Flectere si nequeant populos Acharonta movebunt. which is too too apparent in these Times, when the Nation is ready to be split in pieces by the Hellish Designs and Contrivances of her two Grand Enemies, Rome and Faction; who like Juglers, deal under Board to bubble the credulous Rout into the belief of the well meaning of their Designs; when all that have their Eyes or Understandings find them to be no otherwise than the Hocus Tricks of Jesuitical Legerdemain: yet notwithstand∣ing the many Discoveries and Discouragements they have met with, they are still resol∣ved to persist, and not only venture the hazarding of their Reputation and Lives, but even the Damnation of their immortal Souls; and all this under the mask of Religion, and doing God good Service: so that the Nation now happily escaped from the Roman Tyranny, is like to fall into the Factious Golgotha, and be once more turned into a field of War and Bloodshed: but God who seeth the Contrivances of our Enemies, will laugh them to scorn, and the sons of men shall have them in derision. We have now blessed be God a Wise and Gracious Prince, a Faithful and Understanding Council, by whose endea∣vours and Gods blessing we are in a fair way of returning to a setled Peace again, did not the restless Designs of a Party (who do falsely style themselves Protestants) amuse the Hearts of the people, and put an odium upon all His Majesties proceedings. But, that it may not be thought that the Nation is void of Loyalty and Obedience, and that the Subjects are become altogether Rebellious, the Truly Loyal have taken such courses by way of Adresses, as to assure His most Gracious Majesty of their Fidelity and Resolutions to be ready to lay both their Lives and Fortunes at his most Sacred Feet, in vindication of his Person and Prerogative, if ever occasion shall require; and amongst these great numbers of Adresses from Counties, Grand-Juries, Justices and Corporations, there is one now in agitation by the Loyal Young Men and Apprentices of London, which for the Loyalty of their Intentions, and Number of Subscribers humbly desires to have Acceptance from His Majesties Royal Bounty: But no sooner was this Loyal Adress made publick, but it meets with the calumnious railing of Factious and Disloyal Spirits, who do not fear to blaze their Impudent Lyes and Railings in the face of the World, to put a stop to this Loyal Intention; to attain which, they give out by their Partial Mer∣cury, That the Loyalty of this Design was hatched in Newgate by Priests and Jesuites; That it is a Second Part of Captain Tom's Plot, and carried on by Raskals and beggerly Vermin, enticed only by Pots of Ale, and many such Billingsgate-Reasons, and Stories which I shall forbear to mention. And though I do not know the Author of this Ca∣lumny, and so can say no more, than that I take him to be one whose Reason consists in Railing, and his Honesty in abusing his Betters, like the envious Dog in the Fable, who will eat no Hay himself, nor suffer those that will. But as for his Pimp Dick Jane∣way, him I know, and will leave it to the World to judge if he be not a person whose very name is Scandal to the Books he spues into the World. But that I may shew you the Impudence of their Intentions by the Lyes they vent into the World, I will give you the true Original of this so Loyal and so much envied Address. 1. As for the first Promoters and Inventers of it, Be it known to all the World, that it was neither a Priest nor Jesuite, but the honest Intentions of some Young Men of good Parentage and Principles; whose Names may be seen in the Address it self, and who are always ready, when call'd by Authority, to stand to their Address and Principles; but why they should give Account of themselves to Hen-peckt-Dick, I am not satisfied, but can say they are such that Janeway himself may be glad to earn his Bread from. Secondly, That it is a Capt. Tom's Plot is so ridiculous a Story, that nothing but the
Bigotted Faith of a Factious Fanatick will credit or give ear to; for I here challenge all the whole Tribe of factious Pensioners, and all the Cabal of restless Scriblers to prove one word in the said Address that can be screw'd up to that Notion of Plot, unless they can make Loyalty to the King, a Plotting against his Person; and thankful acknowledg∣ment of our Duty and submission of our selves to His Majesties Service to be resisting his Authority; unless, I say, they can prove this, they cannot bring our Loyal Address under that scandalous name of Plot: but since Dick and his Tribe have said it, there are Thou∣sands will swear it, and so it is, a Plot it must be. A third Sham or Odium that is spued upon this Loyal Address, is, That it is carried on by Raskals and beggerly Vermin, &c. I dare say, there is no such Vermin concerned as those that crawl'd after the Duke of Monmouth's Coach from his Wapping Treat, ren∣ding the ears of people with Factious Huzza's, and G—dam— upon the Duke of York, and No Bishops. I warrant these were no beggarly Vermin, nor inticed by Pots of Ale? I can assure Dick Janeway we have no such Vermin concern'd in our Address, we are all Abhorrers of such Factious Huzza's and Wapping Treats; but we will leave Dicks Ver∣min at Wapping and Billingsgate, the place of their Nativity and Breeding, and return to vindicate the Truly Loyal from that scandalous name of Vermin, and let Dick Janeway know, that the major part concern'd, are Sons of Gentlemen, who daily see how the Decay of Trade increases, by his and his Fellows Designs, that they are more wil∣ling to venture their Lives in his Majesties Serviee, than to become Free-men of this Ci∣ty, if they must enter into Poverty and Freedom at one time; And if Dick can produce one Vermin concern'd in the Address, for shame let him produce him, and in lieu of him, I will produce Thousands, the very meanest of which, is able to buy Him, Care, Curtis, and Vile, and all their Lands and Tenements, Goods and Chattels, who, I think, are such Vermin as to have no more than from Hand to Mouth; and did not the Times aford mat∣ter to Scribble on, and Books to Publish, would be glad to pass from door to door to re∣ceive the Alms of those Vermine, as he calls the Sons of Worthy Gentlemen, whose Pa∣rents will give him no thanks for his Complement. Fourthly, Another Sham or Slur that these Cheats put upon us, that are Truly Loyal, is, That we procure Subscribers that never knew vvhat they subscribed to; this Sham is so evidently false, that nothing but the Impudence of a disturbing Whig durst vent it in∣to the World, and it is so ridiculous a Story, that all that see or hear it, will rather be incited to Laughter than desirous to Answer: but that Dick may not vaunt of his not being Answered, let him know, I take his Author and he for two of Goatham Politicks, for there is not one that subscribed that did not first read, and then consider the whole substance of the Address, and were so far satisfied of its Loyalty, that had they a Thou∣sand Hands none should be wanting to farther so laudable a Design: which is not only to show our Loyalty, but to regain our Reputations, which was blemisht by our Predecessors in the late Times of Presbyterian Disturbance: and though Mounsieur Impartial charges us with medling with State Affairs, it is evident by the Address it self that we do not, but rely upon His Majesties Wisdom in governing the Nation. A thing he and his fol∣lowers have resolved not to do, but if possible, to have themselves the only Counsellors of the Nation. But let them know, that all that have set their Hands to the Address are devoted to his Majesties Service against all his Enemies, as well Papists as Commonwealths∣men; and in the mean time value the railing of Dick and his Tribe no more than to make them the subject of laughter, and the sport of their Discourse; a thing he has truly merit∣ed by being concerned in anothers Affairs. But we may see which way the wind blows, when all things that have Loyalty in them go down like so many Hob-nails, and when all are called Vermin, and such Names that dare say they love the King, and will die for him; And as for that Letter published in the next Mercury, I take it to be a Pig of Dick's own Sow: For suppose Dick Janeway should agree with Harry Care to send that Letter to him by the Penny Post, might not Dick say with a safe Conscience, that he received it by the Penny Post, and so put it upon whom he pleases? And yet the Loyal Appren∣tices be Innocent; for I know none of them of those damning and blaspheming Princi∣ples; and all that ever I can hear of, detest such Practices. But I am credibly inform'd, that Dick Janeway would be honest if his Dame would let him: Alas Poor Dick! I thought whereabouts thy Shoe rung thee; so that I see it is not for want of Will, but for want of Power, that Dick Janeway is not a Tory. Well, as a Friend I'll give him my Advice, I would have him put it up for a Grievance next Parliament, or get a Cross, and Lord have Mercy upon us, set upon his Door; for certainly a Wise-ridden-man has the greatest Plague upon Earth. I'll only teach Him a short Prayer to use in the time of his Tribulation, and so leave him to the Malice of his Fe∣male Tutor.
