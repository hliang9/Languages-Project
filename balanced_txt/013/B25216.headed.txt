PROPOSALS Humbly Offered to the Honourable House of Commons, For the Reducing of GUINEAS, at once, agreeable to the present Standard of Silver, with some Advantage to the King, and little, if any Loss to the People. THAT all Persons on a certain day do declare and bring in the Number of their Guinea's, or other Coined Gold, to Persons appointed in every Parish to take Accompt thereof, or else to lose the over-value above the Price set by Parliament. Guinea's to be Valued at 30 sh. and other Gold propor∣tionable. The King to take all the Gold at the said Price, paying to the Owners Two thirds in Money, and the other Third in Bills or Tallies made Currant by Parliament: That is to say, for a 100 Guineas to pay 100 l. in Money, either Gold or Silver, and to give a Bill or Talley of 50 l. for the rest. These Bills or Tallies to be sunk One tenth part yearly. Guinea's then to be set at 21 sh. 6 d. or 22 sh. as the Par∣liament Please. By this Method the King will have the 1 sh. 6 d. or 2 sh. over on every Guinea towards the Charges of the Bills or Tallies, and the People saved from Loss by the fall of Guinea's. To prevent Counterfeiting the Bills or Tallies, they may be renewed (at an Office appointed for that purpose) once every Year, upon a small Charge allowed for the same, and at the same time a piece of Sealed or Stamp'd Parchment go along with every Bill or Talley, which upon every Transfer each Person sets his Name and Place of Abode. If it be Objected, That it is unreasonable to impose these Bills or Tallies upon the King or People in Payments. It may be Provided, That in all Payments where Bills or Tallies are given, there shall be the like Sum Paid in Money, or else no Person be obliged to receive them. W. JAMES.
GUINEAS Reduc'd without LOSS.
