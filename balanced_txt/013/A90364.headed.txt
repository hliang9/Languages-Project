Vox verè ANGLORƲM: OR ENGLANDS LOUD CRY FOR THEIR KING. Written by a hearty Well-willer to the Common-weale, and the flourishing of our NATIONS. Printed in the Year, 1659.
Ʋox verè ANGLICORƲM. OR, Englands Loud Crie for their King. WHat is there more regarded, or prevalent, amongst Christians (next to Divine oracle) Then the, extrema vox, the last language (as to Counsel and Instruction) of Gasping and dying brethren and friends? And who sees not the fainting, and now utterly ex∣spiring condition, of this so long flourishing nation, (and glorious even to envy) of England, and its Dominions, and Territories? That twenty years ago, it was such, and is at this present, thus; one penful of ink need not be spent to manifest, and illustrate the same: And seeing there is no right remedy will be looked after, or so much as thought on, by the present pre∣tending Physicians, and Chirurgions, who take upon them the Cure; But such potions, and plaisters in preparation to be applied, as clearly, and without all queston, will rather hasten its utter destruction, then asswage the least pain: What then hath this poor hacknied, over-ridden, spurr'd, and spurgall'd people to do, but before their exspiring Spirits be utterly spent, to recol∣lect them with their utmost vigour, and cheerfully to advance their own Soveraign cure; from this desperate malady, in such a way, as (seeing the wily arts, and cunning of deluding men so fail with their false, vain, empty, and pretended helps.) The great preserver of men, who loves and delights in just and righteous things, may yet Bow down his ear, and hear, hearken and be propitious to us, in this our deep Calamity and Distress. How we came into this misery it will be needless to enquire? Res ipsa loquitur: Such dread∣full beginnings, which none can forget, could not in the judgment of all sober and serious persons, but be the production of such horrid conclusions: Our case therefore must be taken as it is; and since so many sorts of cures hath been attempted, so many Empericks have tryed their skill and cunning; so much Phlebotimy and Scarrification hath been used, and all to no purpose, but rather to encrease the dolour, and heighten the danger; why, may we not be per∣mitted to call for, and use this Soveraign cure, and medicine of our own? It is surely a de∣gree, above the height of madness, and an instance, beyond all instance; That when so plainly manifest, and certain a remedy, is with such facility to be had, that an utter perishing should rather be chosen, and endured, and that under the hands of such pretenders to cure, who as (we know) They (or their like) were the first makers of the malady, so it is continued upon us, with all kind of torments, for no other end or cause, but meerly the private profit and ambition of some particular persons our fellow Leigmen, who flinging off all thoughts of subjection, cannot (or at least hitherto will not) endure any the least sound or whisper, towards reverting to that Station where God hath placed them by their Birth-right, nor be satisfied neither, with any elevation less, then the absolute power and Dominion over the Bodies, Lives, and Fortunes of their Brethren and fellow Subjects. And although that art hath been used by them, that Diabolical charming art, of several qualities and effects, dreadful to our memories, to stupifie our senses, and draw us by degrees, into that Lethargie, which so long and so visibly we have laboured under, whilst these cunning operators, have tried all kind of experiments, which enter their own wild Fancies, according to the length of that Mad Worm, which crawls in their heads, and whirls them about to such actings, as dayly we see, in Propatulo, produced to us, pretending to supple Tar, and medicine our soares; But really and indeed, for no other end, save, which of them should be the chiefest shearers, to clip and fleece us, and set what mark upon us, and what Dogs to hunt us they please; Yet coming now to Excotiation, and tearing off from us our very skins, which (whatever fawning, stroking, and soothing is at present used, to make us lie still, till our bonds and shackles, be fast on, and tied close, yet) all Instruments are at work for, and in a near readiness for the action.
Shall we Sheepishly still bleat out our miseries in a wretched Tone, and silently suffer this prepared rending us to destruction? shall not rather the Terrour and apprehension of our emi∣nent danger and distress, rouze up your drouzy numness; And before the knife comes to our throats make use oft hem to utter this vocem extremam, and call out for our certain and undoubted remedy. Which as it is tacitely in the hearts, and whispers of all true English men, why should it be kept close between the teeth, and concealed from those, who at present pretend to be our rulers, there being none more fit to know the general votes and desires of the people, then they who in any kind represent them, or have pretence thereunto; and who (at least some of them) may for ought we yet know to the contrary, be as ready and willing to hearken unto this general voice, and to advance this way of our remedy, cure, and deliverance, as our selves; why may we not then with open, loud, and extended voyce, utter this most earnest vote and desire of our very hearts and Souls. Let the Heir of the Crown be speedily admitted, to his just rights, with all Honour, Freedome, and Safety. And that this voice onely, may do it, This now general voyce, and indeed loud cry, and clamour of all true hearted English, such as are free from all corrupt and sinister ends, and respects whatsoever, may be listned to and take its wished, and long look'd for effect, and so other means prevented, which else (it is to be feared) will undoubtedly be laid hold on: Let what ensueth be taken into serious and timely consideration. And in the first place, least it be objected, that what is here asserted, is not the general voyce, and desire of the people; Let the opposers, put it upon what way of trial they dare: Although ('tis true) there hath been almost these twenty years, such labour and pains taken, such art and skill used, by all the wayes and means, which could enter the corrupt heart of man to in∣vent, for the infecting and poysoning the loyalty and obedience due from all sorts, to his now Glorious father, and to him, h s undoubted Heir. Yet it is a most notorious and unquestionable truth, that upon what way or manner soever, Division can be made, in general, Eight parts, at the least, of Ten, throughout these whole Dominions, even of all sorts, conditions and quali∣ties, from the highest, to the lowest, learned and unlearned, nay even of such, who formerly were seduced to engage against his cause, are now as high and earnest in this vote and desire, as any his first and chiefest adherents; And were there full freedome and liberty given by such as have usurped the present power, for all persons to use, and take their free choice therein, for every single person of the opposers, there would be found at least a thousand contraveners; and of the Nobility, Gentry, and chief Burgers, in all places, the odds would be found far greater: If this be deemed but word onely, and fiction, let there be but license given for publick votes, or subscriptions, throughout the three Nations, with freedome and safety, (and as affairs stand, why should this be denyed,) and if this truth doth not so manifestly appear, that there shall be no room for the least doubt, then let an eternal silence and suffering be imposed on those who are marked out for h s chief adherents, and it is verily believed, there is not a man of them, but will readily assent unto it; and if this be true in fact, and certainly nothing can be more assuredly true, why should it not be openly known and published, that (besides what other effect it may work with all whom it concerns) we may (however) with fear and amazement consider, what strange Fate hangs over this people, and three Nations, that the whole Bulk and Body of them should suffer terrour and subjugation, by so inconsiderable a party, of the number, who 'tis true (as matters are ordered) appear indeed like Alcibiades curtain, which was outwardly imbroidered with Eagles and Lions: But on the other side was nothing but meer Apes and Owles: If we be a free people (as it is said we are) and the supremacy for∣feited for breach of trust, by the late King, and reverted to us, as some vainly prate and scrible, why should we then (in such case,) be denyed that, wherein onely this Freedome chiefly consists, which is, that since this forfeiture, and the Seizure of the Supremacy into our hands, we may enjoy the free choyce of our Government and Governours, and that in such a fair free and open way, That all who are to be obliged to subjection, may manifest their consents unto it: Must we be told we are a free people, and yet must this be denyed us? Nay, when the worst and basest kind of slavery, that ever was in any age since Adam, imposed on any sort of men, is violently thrust upon us, which is, to have an incompetent and inconsiderable number of
seeming Legislators, pickt out for us, some of them out of Corners and Goales, where they lay drenched in debt by luxury, and Ryot, and brought into play, (for indeed it seems no other, then a meer Pageantry) and that upon an old crackt title of election, almost twenty years standing, and long before the pretended forfeiture, and seizure (if any such were or could be,) and since that likewise, nulled, forfeited, surrendred, cassed and voided, almost twenty several wayes, as (if it were Tonti, so do it) may by undenyable arguments be evidently made appear. These men, or, what appellation can fitly be given them? for they come at the call of the the Souldiers, and make themselves their slaves; And the Souldiers are, or should be servants to the people, from whom they receive their wages, yet the people must be made slaves, to these their Servants slaves; here is such a probleme of policy, and Delphick mystery of ini∣quity, that it hath scarce any parallel, unless we call to mind, how the late Kings own power, was made use of, to seise away from him, his own treasure, revenues, Ships, Castles, &c. and by vertue of that his own Power, armed men were raised to fight against his own person; nay, the King in one Army, was made to fight against himself in the contrary Army; Even so, this parcel of Pageantry, this ninth part of Ten (for more there scarce is not of the u∣sual number of such an Assembly, and that onely of but one of the three Estates neither) act here their parts of Sitting, Voting, (and dropping Laws, like the Brood of Trochylus, Eggs and Birds in a moment,) and seemingly Domineering and Vaunting over us, their under∣slaves, themselves the while, being under the iron whip also, and not daring to at∣tempt any thing contrary to the sense of their Masters at Wallingford-house, or wheresoever else assembled, if otherwise Foris Abite, Out you go Sirs, to your Cells and Goayles again: Behold the freedome, and free State we have purchased so dearly, which hath been so long and now afresh noised in our ears, and comes in a new shape and dress, and under a new name, The good old cause forsooth, which indeed is no other, then as the Badge or Tessara, which is used amongst Canting Gipsies, to understand one anothers minds, whilest they in the mean time de∣lude us, and pick our pockets. And most assuredly, whatsoever some fond people dream, of freedome, and a free state, and such empty vain whimsies, as long as their inchanters have prevalency over their weak braines, yet This, and such like as this, is all the Freedome, and Free State, they are ever likely to see or enjoy; Nor is it any way imaginable to be otherwise, in the judgment of sober and discerning persons, who will seriously consider the nature and disposition of the generality of the people of these Nations, and the most excellent frame of Government, so long continued amongst us, and by time refined, and perfected, and all sorts, bred up, fitted and adapted to it; It being so rarely Tempered, and Moulded, that it retains the good, and rejects the ill, of all the known Governments exercised amongst Na∣tions; That to tell us of Venice, and Holland, and such like, The case upon due examination will be found as different (considering all circumstances, in a just frame of Government, not to be omitted) as Heaven, is different from Hell, or Order from Confusion; And that busy, yet empty head, who now fancieth to reduce these Nations, into such a frame, or any thing like it, generally satisfactory, may as well, and with the like discretion, endevour to make a rope of sand, build a Castle in the air, or empty the Sea with his fist; No, here is such a Capital peice of that Government, which (and which onely) is proper, and natural to us, out of joint; that salve the dis-jointure, as well as we can, Annoint, Dress, and Bath it, Plaister, Swathe, and Bind it up, with all the art and cunning, can possibly be De∣vised and and Invented; the patient can never be out of most dolorous pain, till it be right set, and in just joynt again: And how that is to be effected, the now General Voyce tells us, Let the Heir of the Crown, &c. In the next place, it is to be considered, whether any obligation be of greater force then an Oath to the Lord: And who is it, even of those likewise, which are the chiefest oppo∣sers of such his admittance, but hath solemnly plighted and sworn faith and true alleigeance to this Heir; and upon such an Oath, acknowledged him likewise in all Causes, and over all Persons in his Dominions, supream Head and Governor: For is not faith plighted and alleigeance sworn to the Heir in express words, as well as to the Ancestor? And is not that Heir in the instant of his Ancestors expiration, by our Laws immediately, and unquestiona∣bly
King, and so the acknowledged upon oath supream Head and Governor? &c. Nor is this more neither, then what their duty before obliged them to, had they not sworn it, be∣ing his Native and Leige People and Subjects; And God himself by so many clear and itera∣ted precepts in his sacred word, most strictly calling on them, and enjoyning the effect of it; The Government of our Nation Monarchy, being the sole Government appointed by God, and Kings, and Kingdomes, his alone institution and planting, as is clear by the whole current of Scripture, from Adam even till the Primitive Church after Christ; And Repub∣liques, States, and such like, a meer depraved institution of man, for corrupt and sinister ends. This Nation ever since its first being, even for thousands of years, owning Monar∣chy for its Government in all Ages and Vicissitudes; and so was it alwayes owned and esteem∣ed throughout the world, and our Monarchs of such high Honour and Repute abroad, as of∣ten made Umpires in the great and publique affairs of Christendome, and this title and sove∣raignty most clearly descended to, and vested in, this Prince, whose Ancestors indulgence and favours, had rendred it the best of Governments to the people, as was any where extant in the world; yet clearly an undoubted Monarchy still, and so ever exercised by the Sove∣raigns, deemed, styled, and acknowledged, by our forefathers, in all times, and by all our Laws, Judges, and Lawyers, both ancient and modern, and never so unhappy as to suffer the least of question in that particular till, &c. Nor is this title so much to be drawn from the Conquest of William, the Norman Duke, neither, (as most generally is mistaken∣ly alleadged) as from Edgar Atheling, the then apparent and right Heir of the Crown, from whom a descent of title to this Prince is as manifestly deducible, as from that William, which all men conversant in true History cannot but know; And therefore all those silly and most absurd distinctions of the Soveraigns coordinate estate, here amongst us, his virtual and per∣sonal presence in the sense used. The singulis major, sed universis minor; His forfeiture for breach of trust, and a world of such trash, publickly vented, and plausibly scribled on, when time was, only to maze the poor people, and lead them from their duty and obedience, will be found a very pittiful plea, at the great Tribunal for their so horrid a Perjury and Re∣bellion. Let this be seriously thought on, by some Grandees, now in power, and with all, the blood and treasure, thereupon spilt and spent, and the distracting terrors, and rending con∣fusions, thereby raised, and sent raging into all our parts (foreseen indeed by all sober and loyal persons, and vigorously opposed, till treachery prevayled) and in what a torn, totte∣ring, and disjoynted condition, our Government hath ever since remained; And the poor people of all sorts how perpetually affrighted, terrified, and picked even to the very bones. And if new and contrary Oaths, Engagements, and Covenants, by what name or title soever called, for store of them, there hath been indeed, and all kept alike; if these, or any of these be objected; There is no Orthodox Divine; but will tell them this truth (I am sure true Divinity it self will) that they being all unlawfully compacted, they are ipso facto, voyd, and so far from binding the conscience, that like the vow made by the Conspirators against St. Paul, they ought to be repented of, and detested, as the grand crime, for which these direful confusions have befallen us; there not being, or in possibility to be, any oath lawful against the first, nor can any subsequent act, or engagement made (though by all the people in general) be of force to quit, or absolve from that first lawful oath, or from our native duty and alleigeance, which we are bound to, although the oath were never taken; And to teach otherwise (as too many have done, for their own wicked and corrupt ends) is as high a blasphemy against God, and his Sacred Word, as almost can possibly be committed, and that Caitiffe (who ever he be) who for sinister purposes, dares yet continue to insinuate the contrary, let him tremble to think of that horror and confusion, which will one day seize him, for advancing so desperate, cursed, and diabolical a Doctrine; May hearty and timely repentance rather be his punishment; and in testimony thereof joyn with all good people, in this their now loud general voyce, Let the Heir of the Crown, &c. Let the sad and most deplorable condition of the once flourishing Church of these Nations, have its share likewise in our consideration: She who hath thus long laid widdowed in dust and ruine, bedewing her lean cheeks, and tearing her comely hair, her once full paps streaming
with solid sustenance, and now shrivelled up into an empty dry parched skin, and hiding her once lovely head in corners and clossets, as trembling at the attempt, nay force offered to her pure chastity, and fearful to breath in the ayre of those wild and dismal doctrines, every where now vented and prevalent amongst the several Sects and Factions of the times, who have no setled rules, but rather professe the contrary; and that every Ignis fatuus, which they call new light, must be their rule and guide: Let this sad case be thought upon, with more then seriousness; and the horrid and dismal things, which must needs be hence produ∣ced, amongst all conditions of men, if timely remedy be not applied. The late deplorable State of Germany, and by whom, and what sort of people that tragedy was begun, and con∣tinued, which was so long there in action, and brought forth such cruel and unheard of slaugh∣ters and desolations, should me thinks be a warning and example to us, and tell us the dan∣ger of some parties, especially if the sword be put into their hands, as publick report saies, is now the next intended design; zeal being an excellent guide, where it sees the way it goes in, but a most dangerous companion in the dark: But perhaps the decree is gone out, and we are this way destined for utter destruction; Besides, what regrets, animosities, emulations, boylings for revenge, by persons of seeming fiery and high flaming zeal; supplanting and tripping up one another, in their various, greedy, and ambitious designs, are almost every where conspicuous? And which cannot, but at one time or another, break out into most dangerous and bloudy conflicts, to the hazard of enflaming all; the frequent noyse also, and rumors of new plots, firings, and conspiracies, be they real or pretended, yet the very ter∣rour and apprehension of them is to some quiet people a kind of agonish deadnesse, before death it self and destruction cometh; Nor is there the least hope of amending this, but an assurance rather, that it will have a never ending continuance, unless this general voyce be lystened to: Let the Heir, &c. As there be these rents and gals, frights and terrors at home, so can we not but have per∣petual fears and troubles from abroad also. There being many made desperate by exile, o∣thers having made themselves so, as loathing to live amongst such variety of wild humors, and frantick confusions; and being of known and active parts and abilities, and such as will not forget, Dulce natale solum, foelixque paterna haereditas, but labour without all defatigation, to recover both the one, and the other. Let Historians remember, and think of the exiles of Naples and Millan, especially the last, what hot work they made, and how terrible they grew at last, even to all sorts, in the often revolution, in few years, of that Government; And can we think their chief Head and Soveraign (the Prince by general vote here so desired) is or will be ever so asleep; But as his interest is of the highest concernment, so will his de∣signs, and endevors be probably every way answerable; and if he were extinct, another steps into his place, and title, perchance more active and better befriended then himself; and after him, another, and another, to the end of two numerous and apparent Stems; Besides the fourteen titles the Jesuit found out, to the Crown here, in the dayes of Queen Elizabeth. And which of them was made to have the first Soveraign title, is legible enough. It is certainly little lesse then miraculous, to see some men blinded, by interest (profit or ambition, or both having seized their faculties) with what confidence, they seem to assure themselves of the impossibilty of the appearing of any cloud, (especially from Sea-ward) to eclipse their Sun shine; But fansie that all things must needs go on, as their bribed sug∣gesters dictate to them: Surely were these men but as conversant in the History of other Times, and Nations, as they are in the mystery of their own iniquities, they would soon depose and quit this confidence: All men of sober, solid, and unbyassed reason and judgements, when they consider the various and dangerous factions, and parties at home; the murmurs, dis∣contents, envies, and emulations every where abounding amongst us, what a vast multi∣tude there is of men, and humors stirring, and heaving in all places, and some probable enough, even there and amongst those, where the best and greatest security is thought and expected; when there are such persons of interest, and active operation abroad, headed and assisted by such a number of illustrious and heroick Princes, whose high interest, both here, and abroad, will never want Agents, Emissaries, and Instruments, both there and here, even in places, and amongst persons, where they are least thought on, or imagined.
And this (whatsoever may be vainly surmised to the contrary) no way by the wit and policy of man (as our case stands) to be prevented, the generality of the people likewise, so fixed to, and longing for their Native Soveraign. I say, any sober man who considers this, may (without the help of historical examples (of which there are store enough in far more doubt∣ful and desperate cases) very reasonably, and with confidence enough too, conclude, that our Eutopian free State, or Commonwealth, of which there hath been such a deal of noyse and rumor, made such shifting, heaving, and shoving to get up, will quickly totter, fall, and lie flat upon its face, or its no face rather; and by that time, those, who are now upper∣most, have acted their part, and made their sale (for every power must have its pilladge) will there ('tis believed) be tymber enough left, in all our Forrests, and Chases, to make so much as a Toole towards its Re-erection, or the least shore, or prop for its sustentation. Let us not cozen and deceive one another, nor our selves neither, our case is such, if duly considered, and weighed in the ballance of right reason; this flatuous empty bubble, and conceit of a free State, (being the ultimum refugium of those many Jesuitical designs which have been so long practised upon us, and if it take effect in any sort, their very master peece for our division, and destruction, as is fully by several pens manifested to us, and such who will not see it, must needs be wilfully blind) cannot but render us and our Island (that which long with eagerness hath been gaped after) a publick and open prey to our inveterate and popish enemies, and utterly overwhelm and bury us in own ruins and desolation; nor can there be any remedy to relieve us, but a speedy hearkning to, and approving this now general voice; Let the Heir of the Crown, &c. Nor is the Birth, Person, and Parts of this Royal Prince to be omitted in our considerati∣on, being such as would put the whole Christian world, upon some difficulty, to find his Parallel, or equal in all respects: His birth and extraction is so transcendently illustrious, that what Prince is there upon earth, who can challenge a greater, or more noble, and Kingly, and of longer continuance, for centuries of years? His Person so lovely and amiable, that (if publick report be at all to be credited) it strikes a kind of wonder, and amazement to all beholders, and every where generates a noble clemency, even from the chiefest enemies of his Ancestors, and of our Nation and Dominions: His parts and endowments such, as were we free from all subjection to him by all Laws, and to make search, through all people and Nations, for a compleat and well accomplished personage to rule over us, common fame and report could not but send us to him; so meek, gentle, and sweet of behaviour; so firm, constant, and obliging in his friendships; so modest, and patient in his afflictions and suffe∣rings; yet upon just occasion so full of Princely courage and magnanimity; so knowing, and discerning in his reason, and judgement, and by his retirement so fitted, and adopted for moderate Government; But above all, so firmely and irremoveably fixed to the profession of the true Protestant Religion, testified many wayes against the cunning arts, and subtle attempts, and allurements of the most inveterate enemies thereof; That it is an infamy ne∣ver to be washed off from this Nation (unless this general vote and desire be hearkned to, and take effect in such manner as may in some sort purge the same) that such a Prince as he, so quallified in all respects, and so innocent likewise, as to the first cause of difference; and ever since also, saving his desire and pursuance of his just and undoubted Birth-right; a thing which the meanest of us, would be condemned by all, even by our very selves, should we omit or be negligent of, were it but for a poor Cottage: I say, that such a Prince as he, to∣gether with his heroick and high born Brethren, (all of them, even in this their eclipsed ob∣scurity, the very Crown and Glory of our Nations) should be chased from such an ample and splendid fortune, and patrimony, and that by his own Native Subjects, and Leige peo∣ple, and suffered to wander, nay by their means, hunted from place to place, from one Nation to another People, and forced to live upon the alms, and charity, as it were, of those, who are not without (but have had a long time) their grand designs, upon him, us, and all his Dominions, as (it may be feared) time will too soon manifest; Besides the sub∣jecting him, and that whole Royal Race, by this means, to the enticements and allure∣ments, and to the stratagems, nets, and entanglements, of those Romish rooking Game∣sters, who are ranging in all parts for their prey, and will be sure to leave no stone unmoved
to work their wicked ends, where such a Quarry of Royal Game is to be flown at, and with such advantage (as the case stands with them) to be attempted, that the very contemplation of it, cannot me thinks, but draw tears from the eyes, and almost blood from the hearts of all pious, loyal, Protestant Christians, who have any sence, and feeling, as they ought, of that deep dishonour, and reproach, which by this very means, must needs redound to the Professors of the true Protestant Religion, in all parts, and places whatsoever, and no less sport and pastime, to the great Vicar general of Rome, and his Court and Conclave: But as in the ground where Gold grows, nothing ('tis said) will thrive but Gold; so God hath hitherto preserved, this vertuous Prince, most firm, sound, and entire, in the true Or∣thodox Faith, and no doubt but will so continue him, and make him not only in title, but really and indeed a Magnanimous Defender thereof, against all its Adversaries; And cer∣tainly, were it not too true, that Romish cunning designs, and subtle Jesuited infusions are too prevalent; It is impossible there should be the least deafness to, but a ready and chear∣ful compliance with this voice, this now general voice: Let the Heir, &c. And whereas the most perplexed and knotty trouble, of this great business, seems to be the satisfaction and content, which may be expected from this Prince, to all those descent∣ing parties, and Brethren of the Reformation, who are possessed of, and enjoy several per∣swasions, in the matter and manner of their Religion, and the excercise and practice thereof: Let such in the first place, but consider this truth, which is so visible, and hath so often in our late revolutions, been experimented, that they have an indulgence indeed allowed them, by the several, at present, uppermost Powers; But why? Can they possibly be so blind, as not to see; It is only and meerly for their own ends and aims? For as by soothing and fawn∣ing on them, they aspire by their help, and upon their backs, to get to their several high sta∣tions; so by that means, they have hope alwayes so to continue, especially (which hath been the great art of our late Grandees) if they can but divide them into Parties, Sects, and Factions enough: Divide & Impera, being alwayes the Usurpers Motto, for by the strong breath of such divisions, they soar, and hover aloft over all, feeding all Parties with empty hopes, but really intending only the suppertation of their own Grandieur; and this, this only it is, which makes so many great men in power, publick Preachers, and prayers, a∣mongst the poor deluded common people, who look upon them, as so many Saints, and Angels of light sent from Heaven, when he that sits in Heaven, and sees into the heart, knows, they are thereby only advancing their own deeds of darkness, profit, and Ambition. And it hath been notorious enough, that when some of this sort, have climed, and got high∣est, by the means of such stalking horses, and scaling ladders, they have presently docked them, and broken them to peeces; and can these people, or any sort of them, assure themselves of other usage, from any of our new Ambintes, be their fawnings, flatterings, soothings, and indulgences to them, what they will or can be? Surely they cannot, for that which this day is the interest, of this, or that great man in power and esteem; to morrow perchance he sees cause, it should be quite contrary, and then are all his smoke-fed Clients, to seek for a new Patron: Nay, though some sort of these poor deluded persons, have been so long led on, with hopes that they have even seemed to reach the top and height of their wishes, on a suddain, they are tumbled down again into the very depth of dispair: And what then is the mode and guise now in fashion, and use, for this particular? Why a pub∣lick humiliation, or two, will do it, and a short story told of seeming sensibleness for back∣sliding, and then all they think is well, and whole again, and the Grandees may go afresh to work, upon a new score and interest, and (if their old ones will not serve their turn) troal about for new Clients, for in these changing and disjoynted times, there is store enough (they know) to be had any where; Although it may very well be remembred, and is not easily to be forgotten; how that for far less crimes, then what they are pleased to call but backsliding in themselves: Nay, for that indeed, which was so far from a crime, that it was a duty, a strict duty enjoyned by all the Laws of God, Nature, and the Land: How many thousands have been by them fiercely prosecuted, as the worst of Rebels and Traytors, and many hundreds of them torn quite in peeces, and utterly ruined and destroyed; the
whole publick affairs, whether of Church, State, or Common-wealth, ever since the first revolt, and dismal disjoynture, have been droven on, by such several shifted Charioteers, and with such aufracts, windings, and vicissitudes, and so likely never to be otherwise; that there neither is, nor can be, the least hope of setled assurance of any matter, or thing whatsoever; it all, indeed being nohting els, but, as it were, a meer Maze, from which, there is no way to come out, but at the same place we began to enter in. Now if these seve∣ral perswaded Parties in matters of Religion, and its exercise and practise, would but due∣ly consider, and throughly understand their own true interest, there would be nothing more detestable to them, then to depend upon such variable, and transitory uncertanties, or to have further traffique, or dealing with any such kind of Merchants in Religion, who Bro∣ker like, as they serve an old cloak, can dress it, trigge, and turn it, as they list, and when they please disguise it with a new cape or facing. For where or from whom can they possibly expect or hope for a more certain and setled assurance of enjoying a free exercise of the Reformed Religion, and that according to their perswasions, being modest and peace∣able (which is all they seem to desire and aym at) then under him, and his protection, who is so firmly fixed to it, and for whose sake he hath so long and so largely tasted the bitterest cup of affliction, that since that blessed Reformation first made, ever happened to the lot of any Prince, that professed it: Besides, he is their Father, their common Father, and Soveraign, and (without great want of charity) cannot be imagined (especially after such his own manifold sufferings) but to be most tender bowelled to his Children, and Subjects, in whatsoever can with any modesty or reason, be desired from him. There is surely no pa∣tronage, protection, or indulgence, can be comparable to his; freed from all plots, labours, and contrivances for its obtaining, and continuing; Nor no such certainty of enjoyment thereof, and of all other just liberty whatsoever, as is to be had by, and under him, whose cheif Interest is the publick peace and quiet of his Dominions, and the contenting and satis∣fying of all parties, who are now purposely, and by art, and cunning, kept in discontent, odds, and difference, for the ends of others, their several patrons, who are thereby sustained in Repute and Esteem, according to the number of their Clients, and Proselytes; And who can in a moment (as things happen) vary their Interest and Clients too, and leave them in the lurch, for a new cheat and dressing. This his Interest also, is ever one and the same, and subject to no variation in that particular; and his transcendent quality such, that it would be far beneath his honour and dignity, to put the lest delusion upon any sort of Subjects whatsoever. His undoubted Title to the Soveraignty, and to this protection, such likewise, that publick Assemblies (if need be) for conferences, and debates between dissenting Parties, and Brethren, may freely and fully be had, and differences perhaps thereby well quieted and setled, to the content and satisfaction of all, which our Grandees must not, nor cannot endure, for fear divisions in that kind should cease, and so their Empire and Dominion by that means determine. There might much more be said as to this particular, concerning these differing parties, and that to their more ample and full content and satisfaction: But brevity befits this Paper, and if permitted, it may be done as seasonably hereafter, this little may give them a hint, that none more then they have reason to advance this general voyce, Let the Heir, &c. Besides all this, an appeal may surely enough be interposed, even to the secret conscience bar, of his present chief opposers; let them be but single hearted, and fling from them all those by clogs of ambition, and avarice, fear, and prejudice, Romish whispers, and in∣sinuations; and on these terms, let them but consult their own inward true dictates, as in the fight and presence of the great , the true heart searcher; and if so, they cannot but undoubtedly perswade themselves, (for they are masters of reason too, though much bribed and corrupted) that this Nation and People can never be setled and happy, till this general , for his admittance, takes full effect, it is indeed impossible (what ever , or make shew of) it should be otherwise. There are many reasons to be  might somewhat demonstrate, that this belief and perswasion must needs be  express them would swell this small Peece to little purpose, nor is it need∣full
to make that more manifest, which their own souls and consciences cannot but dayly prompt to them. The great Remora, and obstacle, ('tis known) is their security upon such a change, of which more hereafter; but in the interim, why should their few fears and doubts (which they also may safely depose if they please) continue upon three Famous Nations, and the numerous people thereof, these vast expences, frights, terrors, wasting divisions, and confusions, which we dayly feel and suffer, and which themselves know, upon a full per∣swasion, can never be ended, but by this means? To give but a small hint concerning one particular, which (as instar omnium) may illustrate to us the same reason in all others, and that is the particular of the purse, and the vast sums, which are so frequently and violently exacted, and torn from all sorts, and some (and those most) who want it for bread, to feed their Families; especially now the deadness of trade, and all other chearful and usual wayes to advance livelihood, and support, being such, that every mans heart is become quite sunk towards them, each honest man looking like his souls coffin; no life, no chearfulness, no encouragement, to ought that is either good or advantagious, to himself or others of inse∣riour rank, who might else have help and support from him, and the cause of this every one hath in his mouth: Why, the times are such, and so unsetled, &c. Nor can it possibly be imagined to be otherwise, with the Body, and Members, whilst the Head continues in the case it is; set that right, in its place, and all persons, and things else are instantly setled with it. Faci' è res redit ad suam naturam, is a rule, as true, as old, perchance, some one general large contribution may be needful, and what pious and peaceable soul is there, who would not most willingly and chearfully purchase such a lasting peace, and settlement, at such a rate, which indeed will be but small, and inconsiderable, to those vast sums which are now so frequently exhausted. The total whereof, since the People of these Nations be∣came their fellow-subjects sponges; it would puzzle Arithmatick it self, to cast up, and although the sums collected have been so vast, and ample, almost to infinity, yet the Souldier unpaid, the Navy unpaid, and the Publick (as 'tis said) millions in debt, and so hath it been for the most part all along, since the first direful revolt, and so will it ever be: No thoughts, no hopes are admissible to the contrary, whilst this Chymera of setling a Free State, here, floats in the brains of such in power, who tels us, in print, that it will be a brass wall against the claim of the Heir, &c. But it may with more piety and policy also be told them, who vainly so imagine; that the best brass wall is a good conscience, Murus Aeneas sana Conscientia, and that if they keep not that brass wall, they speak of, perpetually lined with silver, and gold too, and that in such quantity, as will not long be to be had, or found in their imagina∣ry Free State, the least pelt of a pot gun will lay it in the dust, to which condition them∣selves, and all of us, must one day be reduced; and how near that day is, none knows, but he that knows all things; therefore it were surely far better, and safer to look to our state in the other world, and not trouble, and busie our selves to erect new States here, in this; which if the great disposer of all things, would put into the heart of those now in power (who ever they be) to do, (and doubtless he would, if they would but truly and rightly seek him) how quiet and happy would all our States be presently here, and our eternal state more certainly blessed hereafter: In so doing, this great Remora, and obstacle, their dispair of security, would also vanish, which having no ground to support it, but what is usual in such case, Guilt and Crime, if they be recanted and purged by such a testimony, as may now be given, what should hinder, but that the greatest security in the world may Hincinde, be both given and taken; and respect and favour had to, as the case may well deserve; if Forraign History be consulted, it is not altogether barren of examples even to all particulars, nor here at home neither, one particular excepted: And for that particular, Id nefandum quidem, it is believed, there is but one or two Persons, now left in the Nation, that in pro∣bability may be charged with the real guilt thereof: And it is not impossible neither, but that those very Persons also may be left to the great and high Tribunal: And as God is a most merciful God, so we are on all hands assured, we may (if we will) have a most cle∣ment and merciful Vicegerent of his over us, and in such a way and manner, as may yet render us all of all sorts and perswasions, Parties and Factions, the most felicitous of all Nations whatsoever; whereas, if this fair opportunity be overslipped, and forraign force,
and power be necessitated to be made use of, (and assuredly that cannot alwayes be wanting to such a Person and Title, and how soon it may be offered, nay pressed upon him, may without much difficulty be guessed at) what pen is able to expresse the misery and calamity, which may in all probability befal us all in general; but especially those, whose obdurate stiffness is such, that although they may yet easily prevent this, yet will not, but clearly manifest, they care not though all be on fire rather, for so perhaps they think they may warm their hands at, and slip away by the light of it: For mine own part, I do here publickly pro∣fess, that this particular of forraign force never enters my thoughts, knowing by the help of History, what dismal use hath been made of it, in many places abroad, and even here at home with us also: But such spectacles of horrour are represented to me, that I may in a manner truly utter the Poets Language of another, Obstupui, steteruntque comae. Nay, at this present me thinks my Pen drops blood, fearing the iniquities of this Nation are so far from being chastised enough, that our sinful account is now in many respects become larger then ever, and perceiving such stiff wilfulnesse in some, and such security in others, and vain confidence in carrying on, and effecting what their delusions prompt them to, that my very soul melts within me, and poures it self out before the Lord, that he may yet (if possi∣ble) be entreated, there may not be one drop of bloud more spilt in this difference; there hath been too much, too too much already of all sorts, from the highest to the lowest, that when inquisition comes to be made for blood (and that time will most assuredly come,) who almost is it, that can truly plead otherwise then guilty, before that Great, and All-seeing, and All-searching Visitor? And therefore that issue of all others should be stopt, and the issue now in general vote (none better, nor more happy for all parties) layd hold on, and take effect, which (if the Lord have yet any mercy for us) may be speedily, and chearfully accomplished, and so a lasting, and firm peace indeed be had and obtained, with safety enough on all sides, and to the joy of all hearts, save such, whose minds and affections are totally given up, and devoted to mischief, blood, and ruine, and care not though all perish, and sink, so they may but keep themselves aloft, and swimming: But I will yet hope better things of such as are (or pretend to be) in Place, and Power: Be that Power in Chief where it will, either at Westminster, or Wallingford House. And to those Gentlemen now sitting at Westminster, although whatsoever is expressed in the premises, as touching their tenuous assembly in general, and their usurped authority by it, or may reflect upon any person of them in particular, it is even now become almost the general language of all men, and that in the very open streets, and (as 'tis said) even in the Vil∣lages also: And therefore Ingenuity obligeth them not to be offended with such, who by this means (for no other is possible to be had, nor this neither without danger) tell them that of themselves, which otherwise (as their case stands) they would probably be ignorant of, being chiefly conversant amongst themselves onely, and vainly nurturing, and cherishing up up one another, in their own (seeming to them weighty, but really and indeed) empty and frivolous conceits and imaginations. The generality of the people in all places being fixedly set against them, which, upon any trial whatsoever, they will be sure to find true, and none almost (especially of sober rank and quality) speaking of them, but with grief, contempt, and disdain for such their high presumption to come, sit and act upon those Terms, and in that manner, as they seem to undertake, to the perpetual dishonour, and infamy of those great, high, and honourable conventions, and the peoples just right of election thereto: Nor any at all owning them, but either a thin herd of known brainsick zelots, and those of very little, or no repute, and of farre less interest in the Nation; or else such, as to gratifie their own revenge and malice, or for some sinister end or other, take the present opportunity, to lay hold on any power weatsoever, to serve their own turns. Though at the very same time they disdain it in their hearts; and the next day, would upon any occasion, be as ready to fly into the face of it, to its ruine, as this day, they are to sollicite it for their own ends: And to know this, and be certainly informed of it, is, or should be, as considerable to them in the Station they stand in, and as kindly taken too, may well be thought, as ought else what∣soever, which is desirable to them, which, and which onely, together with the premised reasons, why themselves should now joyn, and close with the hearty, and most general votes
of the people, is the end and aim of this Paper: However this be so, yet for mine own part I cannot but look upon, and consider them, or indeed, any other Assembly of men, be they what they will, whose power, interest, and influence is such, as to be able to do, either very much good, or much more harm; I say, I cannot but look upon them, with such respect and due regard, as becometh our present case condition: And tell them also this Truth, that it is a kind of honour (be it happened to them by Providence, or what else they please to call it) to have it in their hands (if their Power be such as they pretend to) to obliege most firmly to them the hearts, lives, and fortunes of far the most inconsiderable part of the three Na∣tions, and indeed of all in generall, who cannot but be included in that happiness, which in this conjuncture of time with so much renown and security to themselves, and triumphant re∣joycing of all peaceable minds, and loyal hearts, they may now with such facility obtain for them; and such a Ray of Honour as (if slighted) will very probably never dawn, or in the least glympse thereof appear again to them: And this upon good grounds may further be said likewise, That if the great God of Peace, shall in his mercy be pleased to encline their hearts to this way of Peace so much desired and longed for, it may with full confidence be as∣suredly relyed on by them, that the least hair of any of their heads shall be so far from perish∣ing thereby, that such of them who shall appear most forward and instrumental therein, may have what security they please to bear what share or place they please in this our such restored happiness, which with any candor or modesty can be expected or desired by them; nor would it be grudged them by any person whatsoever, whom they imagine therein their chiefest male∣volents and regrettors; for who can think them honoured too much, or preferred too high, who (as the case stands) and after so long and tedious a storm, can or shall without blood, restore to three Nations that calm and happiness of peace and settlement, which otherwise may per∣haps cost thousands of precious lives, besides the necessitated ruine, terrour and astonishment which in all probability must prevent and go before it: I am sure it may with certainty be aver∣red of some, and upon very good grounds the same also may be asserted of many: And doubt∣less there be thousands, even many thousands of the same pious mind likewise, who are so far from aspiring and revenging thoughts thereby, that to see that gladsome day of our Soveraigns re∣turn to his just rights with honour and safety, that thereby a sure and lasting Peace may be set∣led amongst us, and so derived to our posterities, would most readily sacrifice their own pre∣sent fortunes, (and most of them no contemptible ones neither) yea, and their very lives too, and cheerfully chant out their last Nunc dimittis, &c. And for those Gentlemen of the Sword, who are as highly concerned in this particular as any persons else whatsoever, it is so cleerly their interest to effect what is thus generally desired, that if Cimmerian darkness be not be∣fore their eyes, nothing under heaven can be more apparent and manifest to them; for they cannot surely but see the uncertain condition they now stand in, under what general disdain and odium to their Countrey they live; how often they are put to act the part of Italian Bravades, and Turkish Janizaries, for some vile and corrupt interest or other; how unfixed and unstable their stations are, what designes are perpetually upon all or some chief of them: To say no∣thing of the present designe, now generally in talk and apprehension, Where and in whose hands the Militia of the Nations is to be placed, and what the intended effect and purpose thereby is; how frequently they are made instruments of destruction to their fellow Brethren and Subjects, and often to trip up, and sometimes to destroy one another: And to add to all this, and ten times more which may be said, their Pay, which alwayes is collected from the People long before it is due, many times is subducted from them, and drawn into other chan∣nels, perhaps into private purses, and that to such as are their chief capital enemies: This and much worse is their present state and condition; whereas, if they be instrumental to ad∣vance this general vote and desire of the people, that it might thereby take effect; they would render themselves the very Darlings of the People, and those general hearts which now have them in most odium and disdain, will be so open and united to them, that they would even quite empty themselves for a just remuneration for them, nothing can any way stick upon them of former sully, but this way would be cleerly and absolutely wiped off, and their fame and renown for so just and loyal an action to their native Soveraign, lovely sound, not onely through this Island, but through the whole Christian world, and merit even trophies of ho¦nour
to be erected to them, that their just praise and exaltation may never endingly continue. There would in this case of such return to their loyalty, and giving such undoubted testimony of it, be certainty of Permanency for them, certainty of due Pay, certainty of Honour, and from the highest to the lowest of them, certainty of just and full content and satisfaction, for preferment and otherwise, which their own hearts and desires can with any modesty wish and suggest to them: Nothing of which can be had, or so much as in the least kind hoped for (what ever vain and empty Chymera's are insinuated to them by those whose ends they serve) in that frail and fluctuating condition they now stand in, and in which, the way they are in, they cannot but look ever to continue. Nor is all this meer words and fiction neither, but will be really and undoubtedly made good; nay, (if need be) secured for by such ways and means as shall be subject to no just exception whatsoever, unless they will degenerate from that noble confidence which is or ought alwayes to be refulgent in men of honour, and the Mi∣litary Tribe, especially when they have to deal with a person of such high honour and extra∣ction, and he their own native Soveraign, and who is not in condition to deceive them, nor need they indeed be deceived, but have (if they please) their remedy in their own hands and power: Upon which grounds it is with great reason hoped that they will not be out at, but upon due consideration of the premises will above all others advance this now general voyce, Let the Heir, &c. I intended far more brevity, and fear I have been too tedious, yet are there many things as much, and some perhaps more considerable than what is premised, inviting all people of all sorts and conditions, who may seem in any way to be opponent to it, una∣nimously to joyn in advancing this firm and sure settling way of a lasting peace, and happiness in our Nations, especially those who now in Assembly take upon them to be representatives, and if so, certainly no duty can be more incumbent upon such, then to listen to, and accomplish the general vote and desire of those, whose persons they so take upon them to represent; this certainly, is a main and chief part of their errand, upon which they were first sent, and in∣trusted by them; And for which, they can pretend to any Assemblies, or meetings upon the score of the people: The peoples general votes and desires, they hereby know, and may have further, full, ample, and assured satisfaction that it is so; if they will (and that as speedily as they please) freely permit that particular to be put into any unquestionable way, or order, for such their more full and plenary satisfaction and assurance. Nor can they upon any account whatsoever, before God, Angels, and Men, (even by their own wayes and grounds they go on (be they just or unjust) and according to their own insinuations of free∣dome to them) deny the people this their most reasonable request, that as they take upon them to be their Representatives, so they would give them free leave, and that without any awe, or dread whatsover to be upon them, freely to express their minds and desires, what they would have such their Representers do: If this be denied, slighted, or omitted, what case the people stand in, will surely then be most clear and manifest, and how can it then be otherwise deemed by all (even such who at present may perhaps have some good thoughts of them) but that their own consciences fully dictate to them the real truth of whatsoever is herein before asserted. To which consciences of theirs, it is herein likewise appealed in man∣ner as is before expressed, the sincere dictates of which (freed from, and unbribed by corrupt and sinister ends) if they will neither follow, nor yet hearken to these loud and general cries and clamors of the people, whom they would be thought thus to represent, but keep them still in terrors, bonds, and chains, to be lead captive, as they list, and whether they list at their own few wils and pleasures; then Hear you O Heavens, and hearken O Earth, and Thou the great God and framer of them both, manifest thine own power and might, and cause thou both Heaven and Earth, and all thy whole creation amongst us, in their courses speedily to assist and help us, and thy own appointed Vicegerent over us, to this just way of peace, and firm settlement so much and so long thirsted after by us. Pity, O pity thou our dispised Church, distracted State, and even gasping Common-weale, and let thine own outstretched arm, by such thine own means, as thou knowest best, speedily in this thine own ordained way, Heal up these our wounds, and wasting divisions, which (in such case) none indeed but thine own
hands can close. Pluck us out from this Romish and Jesuitical deep Pit, which is thus digging and preparing for us. And open the eyes of all seduced and deluded persons, who cannot see, and melt the hearrs of the most obstinate and perverse, who will not see, this their common, open, and apparent danger; and be mercifull O Lord, yet be merciful unto them, and let not their transcendent crimes appear against them, at that great and dreadful day of account; Nor This Paper (if slighted) neither to their utter and everlasting astonishment and confusion. FINIS.
