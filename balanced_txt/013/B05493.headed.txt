And We discharge the saids Doits, or any forraign Cop∣per Coyn, either already Imported, or that shall be Imported hereafter, to pass, or be current within this Our Kingdom, at any rates. And commands and re∣quires the Collectors or Farmers of Our Customs, and their Deputs, Magi∣strats of Burghs, and others in Authority where Sea-ports are, to seize upon any forraign Copper Money which shall be Imported, and to confiscat the same for Our use. And Ordains these presents to be printed and published at the Mercat-Cross of Edinburgh, and other places needful, that none pretend ignorance. Al. Gibson Cls.
