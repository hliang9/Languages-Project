To his Grace, His Majsties high Commissioner, and the right Honourable the Estates of Parliament. The humble SUPPLICATION of John Mcdonald of Glencoe for himself, and in name of Alexander Mcdo∣nald of Achatriechatan, and the poor Remnent that is left of that Family, Humbly sheweth. THat it being now evident to the conviction of the Nation, how unhu∣manely as well as unchristianly the deceast Alexander Mcdonald of Glen∣coe, the deceast John Mcdonald of Achatrichatan, and too many more of your Petitioner's unfortunate Family were murdered and butchered in February 1692, against the Laws of nature and Nations, the Laws of hospitality, and the pub∣lick Faith, By a band of men quartered amongst them, and pretending Peace, they perpetrated the grossest cruelty under the colour of His Majesties authori∣ty. And seing the evidence taken by the Lords, and other members of the Commission, which His Majesty was most graciously pleased to grant for enquiring into that affair, hath cleared to the Parliament, That after com∣mitting of the foresaid Massacre, the poor Petitioners were most ravenously plundered of all that was necessary for the sustentation of their lives, and be∣sides, all their Clothes, Money, Houses, & Plenishing, all burned destroyed or taken away, that the Soldiers did Drive no fewer than five hundred Horses, fourteen or fifteen hundred Cows, and many more Sheep and Goats; And that it is a proper occasion for His Majesty, and the Estates Assembled in Par∣liament to give a full Vindication of their Justice, & freeing the Publick from the least Imputation which may be cast thereon by Foraign Enemies on the ac∣count of so unexampled an Action and that it is worthy of that Honour and Ju∣stice which His Majestie and the Estates have been pleased to shevv to the World vvith relation to that Affair, to relieve the necessity of the poor Petitioners, and to save them and their exposed Widovvs and Orphans from Starving, and al the miserys of the extreamest Poverty to vvhich they are in∣evitably lyable; unless His Majesty and the Estates provide them a Re∣medy. It is therefore Humbly begged, that Your Grace, and the Estates vvould from the Principles of Commiseration to Your Petitioners sad Circumstances, as vvell as that of Honour and Justice, Ordain such Relief and Redress to Your Petitioners as in Your Wisdoms shall be found most fit, And Your Petitioners shall ever Pray.
