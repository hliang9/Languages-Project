The Manner of the EXECUTION Of Eleven NOTORIOUS OFFENDERS Who received Sentence of Death at the SESSIONS-HOUSE IN THE Old-Baily, On the 8th of this Instant December, For Robbing on the Highway, House-Breaking, and other Capital Offences. TOGETHER, With an Account of their Penitent Behaviour in Newgate after Condemnation, and their last Sayings at the Place of Execution, all very Remarkable and worthy the Observation. NOtwithstanding the frequent examples of Justice up∣on offenders, yet so hardned are those wretched Miscreants for the most part, that terror has not power to opperate on their stuped Reasons, but the more ruin threa∣tens them, the more they seem hardned, not regarding a future state, till they stand Tottering on the utmost Verge of Life, nor are many of them then so concious as to look towards Eternity, being hardned in Guilt, by perpetrating reiterated Crimes, which by often use, become a Second Nature, yet ought they to be pittied especially upon their Exeunts to another World; but not to dwell long upon the Introduction, I shall proceed to what is material as to matter of fact, and give the Reader an account of the beha∣viour and suffering of these Miscreants, whose Egregi∣ous Crimes hasted them to an untimely End.
John Fauster, alias Page, alias King, an Old offender, several times Tryed for his Life at the Sessions holden it, the Old-Baily, for the City of London and County of Middlesex and Goal delivery of New-Gate, being some time before the Sessions, sent up from the County Goal of Sarum, by virtue of a Writ of Habeas Corpus in Order to his be∣ing Tryed, an Indictment was prefered against him for a Robery upon the High-way upon the persons of Sa∣muel Doughty and Andrew Meal from whom he, together with his accomplices took a Horse, Mony and other things to a considerable Value, he pleaded not Guilty, but full Evi∣vence being given to the Jury, they found him Guilty of the Fellony and Robbery: there was also another Indict∣ment found against him for setting upon on e Mr. Tibber a small distance from Malbourough, and taking from him such Monys as he had, which was not considerable, as al∣so a Horse Valued at five pounds. His Companions in the aforesaid Robberys, who took their Tryals at the Sessions aforesaid, wre these following, viz. Richard Brown, Thomas Harris, alias Piget, Henry Lay∣field, and John Davis, who were upon the same Evidence found Guilty, though they objected many allegations in their own behalf, being all Lusty young Men, some of them 'tis said having formerly Lived well in the World upon their Industry in honest Imployments, but the World frowning, and they not having the fear of God before their Eyes, sell into desolate Company which brought them to undertake such Evil courses. After they were Convict, and had received Sentence of Death, they seemed much dejected as being desirous of longer Life, some of them greatly Lamenting their untime∣ly End and earnestly begging Transportation. Jon Hurching an Old offender, having as the former been brought from Chlmsford Goale in the County of Essex by Writ of Habers Corpus as having committed the Robbery in this County, Robing one William Johnson of a Stel Box, a Handkercheif and Five pounds in Mony some considerable time since between Miling-Green and Bow up∣on the Road▪ The Indictment being Read, he pleaded not Guilty, as likewise did his Companions who were with him in the
Robberys, viz. Joseph Redwell, alias Kedwell, Henry Pafet, Richard Kent, and Thomas Williams, who being put up∣on the same Jury and the fact being sworn, it being a light Night in which the Robbery was committed, and there∣fore the Prisoners the more taken notice of, as to their fea∣ture Linnaments and habit, and they not being able to give a good account where they were at the time the Rob∣bery committed, nor indeed of their Life and Conversati∣on they were all found Guilty and received Sentance with the former, and continued under the same Consternation at the near approach of Death, knowing in the latest Exegent how to value time that preciousest of things on this side Heaven Abraham Casteel, and Robert Mason, were Tryed, and upon full Evidence Convicted of Fellony and Burglary for Breaking into the House of Elizabeth Moreton in the Night time at Newington-Green, and puting her in Corporal fear of her life, taking from thence likewise Goods to a consi∣derable Vallue. Robert Mason, having three Indictments against him for Fel∣lony, viz. for Robbing John Ady, Daniel, Sitherdel and Ro∣bert Skemton; all which appearing upon evidente he was Con∣victed upon each prticular Indictment, having been an Old Offender, yet shwe t the Barr much penetence and pro∣mises of amendme, but too late, for not taking timely warn∣ing of Merc, wic had been indulgent toward him in hpes of his amendment was past, so that receiving the dead∣full Sentance of Death with the rest of his accompices, some of which he decoyed into the fatal snare he run, the same Esq; being forced to undergo an untimely and Ignominious Death. These miserable Wretches according to their Merits having Received Sentece to return from the place from whence they came, and frm thence to be drawn to the place of Execution, and there severally to be Hanged, by the Neck till they were Dead, were conveyed to the Hole in Newgate Loaden with Irons, whither for the Consolation of their Souls and to fit them for another World, several Pious and charitable dispo∣sed Ministers Resorted, giving them saving Council, and such Instructions as were most Suitable to their deplored conditins; earnestly Exhorting them to Repent of their former Sins, and
by Faith to lay hold on the Merits of Christ our Blessed Sa∣viour, who at the point of Death condescenced to save the Thief upon the Gross, and therefore by having a lively Faith and considence in him they need not doubt of Salvation even at the last Period of their Lives, for God is a God of Mer∣cy and with him there is nothing Impossible. These and such like Pious Exhortations wrought upon them so far as to make them bewail their past offences, and by Tears and Earnest Supplications, seek God whilst they were yet in a State of Mortallity, that so when Death had made a Seperation, their Souls might find a Habitation of Rest On Tuesday the Warrant for their Execution was brought to the Prison, and the next Morning the Sheriffs Officers came o Receive them at the Prison-Gate, in order to their Execution, where after their Chains were knocked off, they being brought Down, were put into the Carts that attended, and coming to St. Pulchers Church, had the usual Ceremo∣nies Repeated to them, by the Bell-Man, and then passed on to the place of Execution, where Arriving, Mr. Ordinary and others Prayed with them, and again at the last moment of their Lives Exhorted them to call for Mercy, which seve∣ral of them did, with Audible Voices, confessing that they had been Greivous Sinners, and in their Progress of uncon∣trouled Theivery, had wronged many Persons, but now all they could do was to ask them Pardon, not having where∣with to make them Restitution, and that for those and many other Heinous Sins Gods Judgment had overtaken them, or to this effct, then looking wishfully about some of them 'tis supposed expecting a Reprieve, they again Prayed, and held up their Hands▪ in a Devout manner, till the Ropes being Tied up strait, and then in few words exhorting the People to take Example by their untimely end, they were turned off and committed to the mercy of the Righteous Judge of all the Earth. Entred according to Order. LONDON, Printed for Langley Curtis.
