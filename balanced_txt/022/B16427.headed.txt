¶ The proude wyues Pater noster that wolde go gaye, and vn∣dyd her husbonde and went her waye. ¶ Anno Domini. M. D. L. X.
ON hye feest dayes whan wyues go gaye To chyrche with grete deuocyon Theyr prayers deuoutly for to saye Theyr thynkynge is on thys lesson Or they go forth them selfe to trym Both heed and brest on foote and hande I swere to you by swete saynt sym Thē selfe they thynke angels well to vnderstāde Theyr beautous be hauyour & cōtenaūce demure They thynke full pleasaunt for to beholde But for to go gay ye may be sure They muse full often and many folde And how they myght best to passe brynge Eche as gorgyous as other to go In theyr aparell gyrdell and rynge And other trym knackes many mo. To chyrche they be come this is no lye Vnto theyr pewe there for to knele Reuerence doynge to the otherby with countenaūce meke and becometh thē wele Than syt they downe eche gossep other by Beholdynge theyr aparell of eyther syde yf the one be gaier than the other that doth espie Than she thynketh her felowe set all full of pryde Yet to her deuocyon she dothe her set And Pater noster she doth begyn But to gay gere her hert doth fret And thynketh how she may such gay gere wyn▪
Sayenge to her selfe what fortune haue I That my felow so gorgyous is in her gere And I syte here so poorely her by But it shalbe amended by god I swere ¶ Qui es in celis, and that within shorte whyle Or elles my husbande full sore it shall repent For I can nought gete of him by fete nor wyle But all shall be myne now that I in hāde cā hent From him alway whatsoeuer betyde Tyll I be arayde as other women be I wolde not haue ought for no maner pryde But only bycause it is a good syght to se ¶ Sanctificetur nomen tuum Lorde halowed be thy name yf to such gere I may come Than shall I bere bothe porte and fame As other women in euery where Do alwaye where as they do wende Go feete and fresshe and trymme in theyr gere In the best maner as them doth to pretende ¶ Adueniat regnū tuū, thy kingdom come to vs After this lyfe whan we hens shall wende But whyle we be here now swete Iesus As other woman haue suche grace in me sende That I may haue lorde my heed into wrap After the guyse kercheses that be fyne And theron to sette some lusty trymme cap with smockes wel wrought soude wt sylkē twyne
¶ Fiat voluntas tua, thy wyll fulfylled be Lorde god alway as thys tyme dothe requyre And as my gossep that sytteth here by me So let me be trymmed nought elles I desyre Therfore yf it may be in any wyse For thou hast power therof to do thy wyll To make me go gay after the best guyse For reason it is with ryght good shyll ¶ Sicut in celo et in terra, in heuen as in erthe It is alway sene, go we neuer so ferre That women aboue all the beaute bereth And without gay gere our beaute we marre Therfore good lorde let thys be a mended And gay gere to were that I may haue Or elles my lyfe wyll haue an ende For very pure thought, nought can me saue ¶ Panem nostrum cotidianum Our dayly brede lorde wyll also do wel But of dyuers cornes I haue many a come At home in my barne for to sell But ther with lorde I dare not mell For feare of my husbande that kepeth me so hard A busshell therof I dare not sell For yf he wyste the game ware marde ¶ Da nobis hodye, gyue vs thys daye And specially me my lorde that am heuy at hert Tyll I haue my wyll lorde a parte I saye Of my desyre lorde, or elles I must lyue in smarte
With that full maruayloussy can she syght And in a swone halfe gan she fall Her felowe beholdynge that wofull wyght And wondred full sore than here with all ¶ Et dimitte nobis debita nostra, now Mercy good lorde and forgyuenes what is thys I was neuer thys a frayde I make god a vow Good lorde sayd she than what meaneth thys And her lyttell fynger than wronge she fast Her to reuyue and gaue her swete spyce So she vp sterte than at the laste Lyke a trym gossyp that fayne wolde be nyce ¶ Sicut et nos dimittimus debytoribus nostris As we do forgyue lorde so let vs be forgyuen And than to her she dyd saye without mys ye had a shrode fyt by swete saynt steuen Gossyp myn, how is it wyth you nowe what is your grefe, now I you pray yf I can ease you by god anowe I wyll be redy both nyght and daye ¶ Et ne nos in ducas in temptacionem Let vs fall into no temptacyon now with that, the other reuyued then Ryght sore dysmayde ye me trow And to eche other they gan say Why be ye thus sad my gossep dere Tell me the cause, now I you praye For yf it lay in me now I wil amende your chere
¶ Sed lybera nos a malo, delyuer vs from all yll Raggis and iaggis this wyfe gan to reherse yf I may not go gay I shall my selfe spyll I pray you gossep dere, vnderstād well this verse My husbonde is harde to me bothe day & nyght And doth me not regarde but let me go euē thus Not as other do but as a wretched wyght But yet it shalbe mēded I hope by swete Iesus ¶ Amen, sayd the other I pray god it be so For ye haue good ynought this I do know well Of good marchaundise so mote I the As any is here in this countre to sell For his degre but he is a frayde That he sholde passe his state or loke on hawt Than behynde your backes it shulde be sayd yf he fore amys, that it were all your fawt But cōpetenly take the thyrde peny of his gayne And bye therwith both kyrtell and gowne Than yet shall ye leaue hym alway twayne So do we most parte throughout the towe Or elles we shold neuer haue halfe our gayes That we haue ywys ye may be sure But properly thus we fynde the wayes with ringes and beedes to go full demure Rybandes of sylke that be full longe and large with tryangles trymly made poynt deuyse For some folke it were full grete charge Therfore all thynge by mesure by myn aduyse
But as for you ye may be bolde To do som what more than other maye yet it wold make your husbondes herte full colde If he so harde be and wretched as ye saye That he may not se you go as other do And haue it so well as he hath in store I wolde haue my syne hoose and eke my trym sho with other knackes many a score yf I were as you be, I fayth I swere Somwhat sholde be solde y• he shold not knowe ye haue to sell so dyuers gere He can not know all by god I trowe ¶ Yet may I reioyce alway ywys For my husbonde is glad whan I go trym He wolde thynke I dyd full sore a mys yf I wente not fresshe by swete saynt sym He doth reioyce in my gay gere whan he do se me put it on And wolde I shulde it often were For I shall haue newe whan myn is done O good lorde, happy be ye That haue so good a husbonde by god in throne Among a hundreth ye shall not fynde thre Of all our neyghbours that hath such a one yf god wolde that myne were as your is I wolde be as mery as byrde on brere But hys herte is so set on couetyse ywys That he can neuer be of good chere
And than causeth me often for to wepe whan I thynke on hys vnkyndenes so grete I can not ete nor drynke nor stepe For grete heuynes my herte dothe bete But throught your counsayle my gossep dere I hoppe the better for to spede And for to go gayer another yere with myrth and ioye my lyfe to lede That I may be accepted with euery man Whiche me beholdeth bothe ferre and nere Without your helps no rede I can But by your good counsayle amende is my chere Thys hole in you my hope I sete And without you I am but dede Lusty fresshe gere how I may gete And to go trym in lusty were ¶ Well gossep than do after me And ye shall neuer repente ywys I swere to you by Mary so fre All shalbe well; that nowe is amys beware of one thinge, your tōgue go not to large And forbere your husbonde whan he is grame Speke neuer to hym of such charge with euyll mode, for that were shame Yf ye of hym wyll suche thynge haue As ye desyre for to go gay with louynge countenaunce ye must it craue And with fayre wordes to hym say
My husbonde dere I you requyre Take no displeasure with my worde What soeuer of you I do desyre But this must be done in bed or at borde ¶ My louely husbonde my spouse most dere To you I must nedes talke my mone As reason requyreth ye he my fere And no body elles but you alone Thus I must desyre you with all my herte Take no dyspleasure what euer I saye For yf ye do, it wyll me smarte And for thought I shall dye this is no nay Whan he this hereh than he wyll muse And meruell what your request wyll be Yf he be gentyll he wyll not refuse No reasonable thynge I hope perde ye shall than say, ye lacke that or this And begyn with that thynge yt ye haue most nede I dare say than withouten mys The sooner of hym than ye shall spede With small tryfels ye must begyn Of hym to get gay gere in store Or elles of hym ye shall nought wym And thus may ye dayly encrease more and more Of gorgyous gere grete plence to haue And all with his good wyll for that is best yf ye it so get so god me saue Than may ye were it with peas and rest
¶ Yf he do not gyue you than good comforte Speke ye no more but than be styll But streyght to his wares resorte And therof take ye what ye wyll yf he play the chorle playe ye the same And let hym not know no more of your mynde God gyue all chorles mekyll shame That to theyr wyues be vnkynde. ¶ yf he be gentyll take noughe hym fro Ly tell nor moch whatsoeuer betyde For yf ye do it wyll tourne you to wo Than folke wyll say that it cometh of pride Se what debate this folke haue nowe And all bycause the wyfe wolde go gay I swere to you by god auowe ye were better byde styll in your olde aray ¶ Therfore beware be not ratshe To do or saye that shulde hym dysplease But yf he be churlysshe gyue hym a dasshe Thoughe euer after it shulde hym dysease Amonge his wares spare not at all For halfe is yours as well as his Therfore as nowe counseyll I shall Gyue vnto you by heuyns blysse To do euen so and be not a frayde For lefe nor loche why chulde ye not The faute wyll all to hym be layde Of any one that hereth that
That he so chorlyshe to you is ay And wyll not be frendly as other be Grete shame of him than wyll they say So to be serued well worthy is he And worse be god withouten fable yf worse may be by any meane Consydrynge that he is not vnable It ought on you for to be sene Somwhat better for very pure shame Than it is now by reason and ryght For he is worthy to haue the blame yf he wyll be suche a wretched wyght He can not haue to moch displeasure That hath a yonge wyfe and wyll not her trym I wysshe them care and sorow out of measure And specially them that be lyke vnto hym Myrrours of myschefe we may them call That kepe theyr wyues so bare and poore To many one it dothe befall Thrugh such menes to make a good wyfe a hore An hore? ye may it swere by god aboue They may be wretches that so do Which causeth theyr wyues to chose new loue Thought it sholde tourne them to great wo So vylaynus they be in euery where Vnto theyr wyues in euery houre and tyde yf theyr wyues do go, ought trym in they, gere They say they do it than for gret pryd
And all this is but ialousy god wote That thys doth cause I know it well Hangeth be such husbondes by the throte Or elles the deuyll cary thew away to hel That ialous be eyther erly or late Vpon theyr good wyues that be so meke God sēde thē stryfe and euer debate And a bengeaūce vpon them both day and weke As for my husbonde I nede not to craue But fystes and staues yf I wyll optayne ynoughe of them I may soone haue Thus dare I not speake for feare of payne For no such thynges but I knowe another I shall from hym stele both day and nyght I swere to you by goddes dere mother His bagges I hope to make full lyght yf he may not se me than go gay I thynke not longe to tary here But pryuele togather what I may And chose me than another fere For I can not lyue this in wretchednes I wyll leue hym bare y now It is to me great heuynes To lede this lyfe I make god auowe With that all seruyce in the chyrch was done These wyues homewarde dyd take the waye For sast it drewe than towarde none And so they departed and adewe gan say
whan she came home thys sory wyfe Her husbonde full mery there dyd she fynde She coulde no lenger abyde for her lyfe But nedes vnto hym she must breke her mynde To proue whether he wolde be to her kynde She gan him flatter after the newe guyse And soone her hert she gan vnbynde Sayenge to hym that in this wyse My spouse moost worthy, my husbonde dere I pray you take it for no grefe whatsoeuer of you I do desyre But gyue my herte now some relefe As I hope ye wyll, and therto be glad And say me not nay whatsoeuer befall And than for euer I must be sad Thus in your hande it doth lay all My truste is hole in you set So many wyues in thys parysshe de That go full lustly and trym set A pleasure for theyr husdondes it is to se And now me thynke ye be well moued wherfore the bolder I to you speke As to myne herte moost best beloued Or elles a sonder myne herte wolde breke Desyrynge you with mynde and wyll To gyue me now some goodly gay gere Some susty newes my backe to hyll with gyrdelles and rynge for your loue to were
As other women do for theyr husbondes loue So let me do for yours I pray Than wyll ye bynde me my selfe to moue Grete good of you alway to faye ¶ I am not able to performe your wyll In gyuynge to you that I not haue It is neyther reason nor yet good skyll Suche thynges of me now for to craue ye se your selfe that I do spare And with symple clothes that I do go Honesty wolde ye sholde helpe me care And lyke in parell that we sholde go Let vs lyue as we haue done ere And passe not our bows in no degre To put our selfe in great daungere For your small pleasure it were great pite How tometh now such thynges in your mynde That ye desyre me to do such cost ye spende your labour and wynde And all your wordes be but lost A lacke good wyfe were thys your wyll For to go gay aboue your estate And wolde be glad to fulfyll All your desyre yf it were not to late But I am ferre behynde the hande As now dere wyfe more than I say An hundred pounde ye shall vnderstande with in this moneth I must nedes pay
¶ Towarde the same wyfe I ne haue Twenty pounde in syluer nor golde which doth make so god me saue whan I theron thynke myn herte full colde Therfore good wyfe take therof no grefe For I am not able as the tyme requyre Excepte I sholde therof be a thefe And that I thynke ye wyll not desyre For that were a shame I tell you playne As well for you as it for me With shame for my trespas I shode be slayne And hanged full hye vpon a tre Than men wolde say there hangeth a thefe Which wolde than full sore greue your herte It is no nede for to a. A shamfull name that wolde vs cause to smarte ¶ Thus answere she had this good wyfe That her herte sonne into her hose And wery she was ryght sore of her lyfe But with her busbonde she dyd no more glose Sodeynly she set her handes on her syde And sayd than caytyfe god gyue the wo I tell the playne it is for no pryde But onely with other wyfes for to go That was mynentent and nothynge elles But seynge it wyll no otherwyse be I shall make the a hode and set it full of belles which shalbe marked in all this countre
Though euery man knew it I set not a flye And what I do, now I ne care Within shorte whyle thou shalte well spye That I shall make thy bagges full bare ¶ With that from the borde thys wyfe gan go And bad hym beware of her euyll wyll She sayd for euer she wolde be his fo And do her best hym for to spyll Therto she wolde laboure bothe day and nyght With all the helpe that she coude make And that she coude get with mayne and myght Another sholde spende it for his sake ¶ The man was wroth here with ywys And wandred full sore what his wyfe ayled He toke vp hys hande and hym dyd blys wenynge to hym that her wyttes had fayled But it was not so on myschefe she was set The deuyll hym selfe coude not her tourne Though he with staues her sholde haue bet which made full sore his hert to mourne ¶ Than was he bewayled all in wo Ryght pyteously he dyd complayne Thynkynge alway what hys wyfe myght do Hym thought for sorow his herte was slayne Bycause hys wyfe was set on rage what best was to do he hym be thought Her furyous anger to a swage Her mynde he perceyued was set to nought
¶ Fayne he wolde her let, this good honest man And hepe her in goodnes as he had done ere Alas he sayd no rede I can Of myne vndoynge I stande in feare That she wyll me robbe by day and nyght Than fare well my ioye and my solas Many a man hath wronge and moch vnright Thrugh theyr false wyues, alas, alas ¶ And so am I lyke me doth thynke For such one is able a man to marre For thought I can neyther ete nor drynke So sore is my hert set now in care Yet wyll I not my selfe caste awaye Thought she wyll be lewde and also bad With costly garmentes I wyll not ray For my destruction to make her glad ¶ I thynke she hath founde some vilaine knawe That wyll helpe her to cary away my store Yet I truste that god wyll me saue And preserue me from her daunger for euer more For a cursed wyfe is worse than a fende Yf I me blesse he can me not dere But this cursed wyfe where euer I wende Putteth me in doubte and great fere Wherfore I dare not go out of the dore Lest she me begyle and go her waye with some lewde knaue to play the hore And me vnto for euer and aye
Yet to my curate I wyll hye And shewe hym of my grefe what I do ayle To knowe yf he remedy Me of my wo or ought me auayle ¶ In this meane whyle hys wyfe was gone Vnto her gossep to shewe her grefe The good man founde hym selfe alone Withouten comforte or relefe Than streyght to the chyrche he gan hym dresse Vnto the curate which he there founde All redy reuest goynge to messe And towarde the aulter he was bounde ¶ This man abode tyll masse was done For to take counsayle of hys curate dere Whan he hym met ryght soone anone He made his mone with heuy chere After all gretynges to hym thus he sayd Syr I you requyre of counsayle nowe My wyfe doth make me so sore dysmayde That I am lyke to dye I make god auowe ¶ With shorte conclusyon his mater he tolde How it began and how it befell Twene hym and his wyfe yt made his herte colde But euer the preest bad hym do well And god sholde helpe hym euer at his nede yf he dyd trust vnto his grace Alway the better sholde he spede And heuen at the last he sholde purchase
Yf she wyll be nought and not amende And thou entende euer well to do Good grace god shall vnto the sende whan she shall lyue in care and wo Go thy way home and take no thought But euer take hede what so befall For such one as doth set her to nought To vndo a man she careth not at all This man dyd after the curates rede And home full soone he dyd hym hast But whan he came there his herte dyd blede He spyed that his labour was all in wast And that his wyfe had ben there before And spoyled all that she myght cary Of shorte endes and money that he had in store No legger with him that she wolde vary Thus was the good man vndone for euer God gyue all such wyues care For after that day he saw her neuer But of his welth she made hym bare Now Iesu that is heuen kynge Graūte all good wyues that fayne wolde do well The ioyes of heuen at theyr endynge And to be preserued fro the paynes of hell Such Pater noster some wyues do say Another were better for theyr soule helth As here doth felow so sholde ye pray And than ye sholde euer lyue in welth
