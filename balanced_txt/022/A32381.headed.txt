WE taking into Our Princely consideration, of what import it is to the Trade, Ship∣ping, and Sea-men of this Our Kingdom, That an Act, Entituled, An Act for the Increase of Shipping and Navigation, be in all the matters, clauses, and things therein contained punctually observed: And an Address having been made unto Vs the last Session of Parliament by Our House of Commons, Shewing that several Goods and Merchandises have been Imported contrary thereunto, to the great discourage∣ment of such Merchants who do honestly and truly observe the same, and Import their Merchandises in such manner, and from such places as is therein required. And whereas One other Act is passed this last Session of Parliament, Entituled, An Act for the Encourage∣ment of Trade, wherein are many matters of great advantage to this Our Kingdom, if well observed; We have thought fit, and do hereby with the Advice of Our Council, Publish and Declare, and Our Will and Pleasure is, That both these Acts be punctually observed; And we hereby strictly will and re∣quire all Officers of Our Customs, and all others whom it may concern, to imploy their utmost dili∣gence for the due observation and execution of both the said Acts, upon such pains as by Law they shall become lyable unto, and the incurring Our utmost displeasure.

And whereas one principal motive or reason moving Vs thereunto, was the prevention of Stealing Custom for the said Com∣modity; But being informed, that many persons who do Import the same, do continue their undue Practises, and still defraud Vs of Our Dues, We have thought fit by this Our further Proclamation, with the Advice of Our Privy Council, to publish and Declare Our Royal Will and Pleasure to be, That from and after the Twenty ninth of September following, no Merchant, or other person whatsoever shall have any benefit of that Our Proclamation, but such as shall before Lading of any the said Spices in any Ports beyond the Seas, give notice of their intention of Lading the same, unto Our Commissioners or Farmers of Our Customs at the Custom-House in London for the time being, with a particular Invoyce of the several Spices intended by them to be Laden, with their Quantity, Quality, and name of the Ship, and Master or Commander of the Ship on which they intend to lade them, and the place into which they in∣tend to Import the same, and shall have a License under the Hands of Our said Commissioners or Farmers for the time being, or any three of them, for the Importing the same in such Ship, for such Port as aforesaid; Which said License they are hereby authorized and required to grant without any Fee, Gratuity or other Charge whatsoever, to the person demanding the same.
