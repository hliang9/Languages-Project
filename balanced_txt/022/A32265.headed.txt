His Majesties GRACIOUS SPEECH To both Houses of PARLIAMENT, At their Prorogation. My Lords, and Gentlemen, I Need not tell you, how unwillingly I call you hi∣ther at this time, being enough sensible what ad∣vantages My Enemies both abroad and at home will reap by the least appearance of a difference be∣twixt Me and My Parliament; nay, being assured, they expect more suc∣cess from such a Breach (could they procure it) then from their Arms.
This, I say, shall (whilest I live) be My chief endeavour to prevent, and for that reason I think it necessary to make a short Recess, that all Good Men may recollect themselves against the next Meeting, and consider, Whe∣ther the present posture of Affairs will not rather require their applica∣tions to matters of Religion, and Sup∣port against Our onely Competitors at Sea, then to things of less importance; and in the mean while, I will not be wanting to let all My Subjects see, that no care can be greater then My Own, in the effectual suppressing of Popery: And it shall be your faults, if in your several Countries, the Lawes be not effectually executed against the Growth of it. I will not be idle neither in some other things which may add to your Satisfaction, and then I shall expect a suitable Return from you. FINIS.
