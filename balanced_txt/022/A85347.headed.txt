A good Motion. IF the rich will deale their Bread to the Hungry, as Isaiah 58. 7. by forbearing one Mealss Meat in a weeke, and giving the value of it but for one yeare to maintaine the Children of the poore: and the poore doe the like to maintaine their owne Chil∣dren; the rich may be re-imbursed in one yeare (without any doubt of Sacriledge) the foure hundred thousand pounds lent upon the assurance of the Bishops Temporalities (which will bee six yeares sooner then all the rich are likely by a doubted course to get in their Monies) the Children of the poore may have the whole revenue of the Bishops Temporalities to breed them up in Learning. A glorious University may be founded in London, eve∣ry Bishops House in the Countries be imployed as Eaton Col∣ledge, Victuals become cheaper, spirituall and corporall Famine be avoided: And all these (in reason) be certainly effected with∣out expence of one halfe penny. For if the value of one Meale in a weeke in each Parish (one with another) amounteth but to twenty shillings) there being almost ten thousand Parishes in England) and ten thousand pound weekly amounteth to five hundred thousand pounds in one yeare; then in one yeare the foure hundred thousand pounds will be re-imbursed with an overplus. And God, the Rich, the Poore (yea all) be well pleased. London Jan: 14. 1646
