To the READER. Courteous Reader, I Intend here briefly to declare, for the better understanding hereof, what was the occasion that moved me to make this small Work, and afterward to publish it for the common service of those that take delight therein. Having Exercis'd this Art of Architecture for divers years in sundry pla∣ces, I have been alwaies pleased to see the Opinions of as many Writers as I had, concerning this practice of the Ornaments, and by comparing them both among themselves, and with the Works of the Ancients, which are seen yet in being, to draw from thence some Rule, on which I might relie with such security, as might please, if not all, yet at least the greater part of them that are capable to judge of this Art, and that only to serve my own use, without any other end. Therefore laying aside many things of those Writers, from whence ariseth no small difference, to the end to rest more secure, I proposed to my self the ancient Ornaments of the five Orders which are seen among the Antiquities of Rome; and considering all together, and examining them by diligent Measures, I have found that those which seem most beautiful to common judgment, and which represent themselves with most grace before our Eyes, those I say have a certain cor∣respondence and proportion of Numbers among themselves not intricate, seeing that each of the lesser Members measure the greater, punctually distributing them into so many parts. From whence considering more nearly, that all our Senses are pleased in this Pro∣portion, and displeasing things are different from it, as the Musicians do most sensibly demonstrate in their Science; I have taken Pains these many years to reduce the said five Orders of Architecture under one brief Rule, easie, and which might readily be put in practice; and the manner which I have observed in it is thus. Desiring to bring to this Rule the Dorick Order, for an Example I have found the Theatre of Marcellus to be the most commended among all others, according to the judgment of every one, and therefore also I have
taken it for the Foundation of the Rule of the said Order; of which having determined the principal parts, if afterward certain of the lesser Members have not so exactly answered to the proportion of Numbers (a thing which often happens by the work of the Tools, or other accident, which may often be in these small things) that I have fitted to my Rule, not differing in any thing of importance, but accompanying rather that small licence with the authority of other Dorick Orders, which also are esteemed beautiful; from whence I have taken the other smaller parts, alwaies when it was necessary to supply it. Not as Zeuxis did of the Virgins among the Crotoniacks, but as my judgment hath led me. I have made this Election of all the Orders, taking them purely altogether from the Ancients, and not mixing any thing of my own, except it be the distribution of Proportion, founded on simple Numbers, not having regard either to the Braces, Feet, or Palmes of any Place, but only to one Arbitrary Measure, called A Module, divided into so many parts as from Order to Order may be seen in its proper place. And by this means I have so facilitated this part of Archi∣tecture (otherwise difficult) that any mean understanding, if he have but only some taste of the Art, may comprehend the whole at one view; and easily use the same, without taking much pains in reading. Yet had I no intent to publish this Work, if it had not been for the intreatie of many of my Friends which desired it; and much more by the Liberality of my perpetual, most Illustrious, and most Reverend Lord, Cardinal Farnese; which, besides that I have received such courtesies from his Honourable House, which hath given me favour to make this diligence, hath also given me the mean to be able to satisfie my Friends in this particular, and to give you suddenly other greater things on this Subject, if this Part be so accepted of you as I hope it will be. And seeing that in this place it is not my design to answer Objections, which I know will be propounded by some, that being not my intention; so leaving the charge to the Work it self, which being acceptable to the Judi∣cious, will cause them to answer for me against the Objections of others: I say only, That if any one shall judge this Work to be vain, maintaining that there can no firm Rule be given, because that according to the opinion of all, and namely of Vitruvius, there must oftentimes be added and substracted to the proportions of the Members of the Ornaments, to the intent to supply by Art in those places, where our sight may be deceived by any accident. To that I answer, That it is wholly necessary in that case to know how we
would have them represented to our Eyes, which shall be alwaies a firm Rule, which in another place I have propounded to be observed, seeing that we proceed therein by certain curious Rules of Perspe∣ctive. The Practice whereof (so much as is necessary to this Art, and to Painting both together) I hope to give you suddenly, in such manner as I am assured will be dilectable to you. My intention, as I have said, was none other than to be understood by those only, which have already some taste of the Foundation of the Art, and therefore I had not added the Name to any particular Member of the Five Orders, presupposing them to be already known. But finding afterwards, by experience, that the Work was very acceptable to divers Persons of Quality, moved by the desire they had to be able to understand with little labour the entire of this Art concerning the Ornaments, and that they desired no other thing than the particular Names, I was willing to add them accor∣ding as they are ordinarily called at Rome, and in such order as you may see, only advertising that the Members which are common to divers Orders, after they have been only once named in the first Order, there is no mention made of them in the other Orders. G. Barozzio.
The TRANSLATORS PREFACE. To the Reader. Gentle Reader, COnsidering that those things are easiest comprehended and best retained in memory, which is taught by the fewest Pre∣cepts, therefore we have made choice of this Author as an Introduction to the Ornamental part of Architecture, and have styled him, The Regular Architect, because he sets down one general Rule for the Principal Numbers of all the Five Orders; which Rule our Author found from the Observation which he made of the Antiquities of Rome. The Author being per∣spicuous of himself, we have endevoured to render him in his own Sense, only adding here and there a word upon occasion to explain his meaning more fully. If this find acceptance, expect in a short time the Rules of Practical Perspective of the same Author, From him, who is A Lover of all ingenious Artists, JOHN LEEKE.
TVSCANE DORICK IONICK CORINTHIAN COMPOSITA Intending to treate of the five orders of Columnes; that is to Say the Tuscane, the Dorick the Ionick, the Corinthian, and Composita. it is convenient at the begining to shew the figure of each kind of Which I am to speak, although their particular measures are not set downe, being that they are onely here put to shew a general rule, which afterward shalbe declared particularly in each order architectural diagram
Finding no Tuscan order amonge the antiquities of Rome, from whence J might haue formed a rule as J have found in the other foure orders; the Dorick, Ionick, Corinthia, & Comparita, J have taken the authoritie of Ʋitruvius in his fourth booke & seventh Chapter, where he Sayes, that the Tuscan Columne ought to be in height with the base and Capital Seven times his owne diameter or thicknes In the rest of the ornaments namely the Architrave Fries and Cornice, it is convenient to observe the rule, which J have found in the other orders, that is, that the Architrave Frise and Cornice may be the fourth parte of the height of the Columne, which is 14 modules with the Base, and Capital, as is Seene set downe by numbers; so also the Architrave, Frise and Cornice Shalbe 3½ modules, which is the fourth parte of 14, the particular members shalbe exactly Set downe in their proper place, architectural diagram
Being to make the Tuscan order with out a pede¦stal, the whole height Shalbe divided into 17 ½ partes and each of those partes shalbe called a Module, which againe wee divide into 12 equal partes, and by these measures at the Saied order is formed with every particular member thereof, as is Seene in the designe Set downe both in whole numbers and fractions architectural diagram
But being to make the Saied order with a pedestal the whole height is to be divided— into 22 partes and ⅙ which is done, because the pedestal requires to be in height the third parte of his Columne with Base and Capital, which being 14 modules, the third parte is 4 modules and ⅔ which added to 17 modules and ½ make together 22 modules and ⅙ architectural diagram
Although a pedestal is sildome made to the Tuscan order, yet haue I put it here in designe to follow order, giving you to understand that in the five orders I have observed it for a general, and that the pedestals with their ornaments ought to be a third parte of their Columne with Base and Capital, as al the ornaments aboue, that is to Say, the Architruve Frise and Cornice ought to be a fourth parte of the Same, Form which being vnderstood & presuposed there ariseth this great facilitie in the worke that being to make any of these five orders after the height which it ought to have is determined it is to be divided into 19 partes with its ornaments (then 3 partes being left aboue for the Architruve and 4 below for the pedestal, the 12 partes remaning are for the height of the Columne with the Base & Capital, which being taken, & making the division of the modules, according as it shalbe either Corinthia or Dorick or the other orders, & then the whole order is made by that module divided into its partes, as Shalbe Seene in its due place; A the Body or Shafe of the Columne: B: Cincta Regula or list: C: Torus: D: the Blinth-E-listello a name most general and vsed in differently in al the like members whether the be lesser or greater F Cimatum. G the Pedestal H listelo I the Blinth of the Pedestal, architectural diagram
Hauing before described in general the principal measures for drawing the Tuscane order, J have here and in the foregoing page, designed the partes in great to the ende that you; may See Particularly, the division of every one of the Smalest partes, together with their project∣ture and that the clearenesse of the designe with the numbers adjoyned may be Sufficient to mak you understand the thing without many words, as any one may easily know of himselfe with Smale consideration A. Ouolo. B. Rundel. C. Listello. or. Regula. D. Corona or Dropstone. E. Listetto. F. Cymatium G. Frise H. Facia or List of the Architrave I. Architrave K Chimatium or list of the Abacus L Abacus M Echinus N List, O Frise of the Capital, P Astragal Q Coller of the Columne R the Body of the Columne architectural diagram
The Manner to make the divisions of this Dorick order is this The whole height is devided into 20 partes, and of one of those partes is made the module, which is also devided into 12 partes, like as was done in the Tuscan Order the Base with the list or lowest Cincture of the Columne Shalbe one module, the trunck or Shaft of the Columne without the Base Shalbe 14 modules, the Capital shalbe one module and then the ornament, that is to Say the Architrave Frise and Cornice shalbe 4 modules, which is the fourth parte of the Columne with the Base and Capital as Wee have Saied before, The Architrave ought to be 1 module the Frise 1½ and the Cornice 1 ½ which added together make 4 modules, and being added to the rest make 20 architectural diagram
When you would make the ornament of Galeries or Porticos according to the Dorick order the light (as hath ben Saied) must be divided into 20 partes, and from thence the module must be formed, Then the breadth, must be divided so as betweene the Pilasters there may be 7 modus and that the Pilasters may have 3 modules, For so the — breadth is divided with the height,  to the proportion of the opening of the light, of twice the breadth in height, and the distribution of the Metopes and Trigliphs falls right as you See. It Remaines onely to Consider that the Colu∣mne ought to Come forth of the Pilaster ⅓ of a module more than the halfe which is done to the intente that the projec¦tures of the imposts may not exeede halfe the Columnes and this Shalbe a general rule in the like cases of al the — orders architectural diagram
Being to make Galeries with their pedestals according to the Dorick order, the whole height ought to be divided into 25 partes and ⅓, and one of those partes Shalbe a module, the breadth betweene the pilasters Shalbe 10 modules, and the breadth of the pilasters Shalbe 5 modules for so the distribution of the metops, and Trigliphs shal fall out right and the voide of the Arches in Such proportion that the height shalbe double to the breadth which in height as you may See is of 20 modules architectural diagram
The Pedestal of the Dorick order ought to have 5 modules and ⅓ in height the impost of the Arch designed there aboue one module and the particular members thereof are to be divided according to the members as they are there Set downe A the Chan̄ells of the Columne B the lowest Cincture of the Columne which ought so to be understood of all the orders C Rundel or litle stafe architectural diagram
This parte of the Dorick order is taken from the Theater of marcellus at Rome, as I have said in the preface by way of example, and being designed it retaines the same proportion A Hollow of the upper list, B Denticuli, C Capital of the Trigliph, D Trigliph in which the partes  inward are called Channells and the square space of the frise which Remaines betweene one Trigliph and the other is called metope, E Guttae, dropps, or smale bels F Cymatium G Annult, cinctures or Lists architectural diagram
This other peece of the Dorick order is taken from divers reliques amonge the antiquities of Rome, and such a composition is made thereof, which I have found to prove wel in worke A Cymatium, B Modilions a name by which They are al called althought they be of different formes, when they doe the office to sustaine the Coruice, C Astragal. architectural diagram
Being to make the Ionick order without apedestal, the whole height ought to be divided into 22 ½ partes, and of one of those partes is made the module, which is divided into 18 partes, because this order being more gentile then the Tuscane and Dorick, hath olso the partes thereof more slaider, The Columne ought to have 18 modules comprehending the base and Capital, the Architrave 1 ¼ module, The frise 1½ the Cornice 1 ¾ which numbers being added together, make the Architraue Frise and Cornice 4 ½ modules, which is the 4 parte of 13 modules the height of the Columne architectural diagram
When you would make Galeries or Porticos according to the Ionick order, The breadth of the Pilasters shalbe 3 modules and the distance betweene the Pilasters shalbe 8½ modules and the height 17 modules which is the double of the breadth, which is a rule which ought to be observed constantly in all arches of the like ornament, if necessitie doth not Constraine to doe otherwisse architectural diagram
But when you would make Porticos or Galeries according to the Ionick order with Pedestals, the whole height is to be divided into 28 ½ partes, The pedestal with his ornaments being 6 modules, which is the third parte of the Columne with base & Capital which is to be obsarved in al the orders as wee have said, The breadth betweene the Pilasters shalbe 11 modules the height of the arch 22 modules. The breadth of the Pilasters shalbe 4 modules, as you may see noted  numbers in the design. architectural diagram
The Cornice of the impost set aboue is one module in height, and the projecture thereof is ⅓ the particular members may be knowne by the numbers, as also those of the pedestal and  A Scotia or upper hollow B Astragals or Rundles architectural diagram
The maner to make the Ionick Capital, as it is here designed in this present figure with the plane and profil for the more Claire  understanding there must be two perpendicular lines drawn, all the distance of two modules the one from the other, which may passe bthe  of the eyes of the volutas, which are called  The whole voluta ought to be 16 partes of a module in height whereof 8 are aboue the eye  it  being two partes and the other 6 remaines  the eye. The maner of drawing the voluta  designed in the following leafe, where also  Shalbe explain  much as the space wil pe the maner  which you are to proceede architectural diagram
Having drawne the Cathetus of this first voluta, and another line Square to it by the center of the eye, the Saied  ided in the manner expressed aboue in the figure A, and is began from the first point marked ī, and there is drowne a fourth parte of a Circle with the compasses then from the point marked 2 is drawne another fourth parte  proceeding the three turnes come to be accomplished, Then to make the breadth of the list so as it may be afourth  which is left aboue by the first tract so each parte which Sawes for Centers is divided into 4 and afterwards drawing  of circles, they Shalbe accomplished by those centers. But to make the voluta after the manner represented underneath the line called  be drawne, which shal haue the hght of 16 partes of a module, whereof a shalbe aboue the center and  beneath and one the Saied center, you shal divide the circumference into 8 equal partes, as you See it designed Then afterwards the triangle BCD ought to be made, so as the  BC ay be 9 partes of amodiū, and the line CD. 7. and because that it may be Seene and understood by the design  d marked with numbers it is sufficient that I have drawn  afterwards the points of the line BC ought to be   ide the circumference of the voluta, as  by numbers, and then bacing from point to  the  found  the first foot of the compasses  ning the other foot to the center  of the eye of the  circumference within the Saie  the Compasses you put the first point on the point  where  that parte of, circumference  halbe  circumference from 1 to 2 then Set the  foot of the compasses on the point and put in the other to the co  the voluta & then drawing an arch of a circle as before then without remoing  Set  foot upon the point 3 and turning the other foot where it cutts the Saied arch Shalbe the other center which  aw  the voluta from 2 to 3. And so you hal proceede from point to point architectural diagram
this Corinthian order without a Pedestal the whole height is divided into 25 partes, and the  made of one of them, which is divided into 18 partes, as it was in the Ionick order the other principal  seene in the figure, and the distance from one Columne to the other ought to be a modules and ⅔, as wel that th architrave aboue be not overcharged, as to accomodate the modilions aboue in the Cornice as they  thy to the midle of the Columnes in their  ment architectural diagram
To make the Arches of Galeries according to this Corinthian order, you ought to proceede as it is here noted in numbers So as the opening of the Arch may be 9 modules in breadth and 18 modules in height, and the Pilasters shalbe 3 modules architectural diagram
But to make Galeries with pedestal, the whole height shalbe divided into 32 partes, and of one of them Shalbe made the module, 12 of them Shalbe the breadth, and 25 the height of the opening: and although it passeth two squares, it is Convenient in this order in respect of the landernesse thereof. The pilasteres shalbe 4 modules as it is Set downe in the designe architectural diagram
If the pedestal of this Corinthian order be the third parte of the Columne, it shalbe Six modules and ⅔, but it may be made of Seven modules for the more Soliditie, very Conformable and agreable to this order; and also to the ende that the pedestl without the Cima¦tium and Base, may be two Squares, as may be Seene by the numbers the rest, that is to Say the Cima¦tium and base, Seeing that the are Set downe in their Smalest partes, as also the impost of the Arch there needes no farther description of them. A the upper Torus. B the lower Torus. architectural diagram
By the ground plat and profil of this Corinthian Capital al the measures may be knowne, by the ground plat the breadths are measured by making a square whose diagonal line shalbe 4 modules, and on one of the Sides of the Square is made an Equilateral triangle as you see in the figure, and Setting one foot of the Compasses in the Angle marked ✚ the hollow of the Abacus is drawne, in the profil the height of the leaves, Stems and Abacus, and the extente of the leaves and stems is taken by the line which comes from the point of the Abacus to the round of the Columne, as may be seene by the designe of the profil, the rest may be easily understood with a litle Consideration A  together are called the Abacus of the Capital, but for better understanding A is taken for the Cima¦tium of the Abacus. C the stem, D the lesser leaves, E the midle leaves, F  under leaues, G the slower. architectural diagram
This Corinthian Cornice is taken from divers places at Rome, & principally from the Pantheon or Temple of the round, and from the three Columnes which are in the Romain market, and Compairing their principal members, I have Set downe their rule before not differing any thing from the ancients, and reducing itt to that proportion, that a modilion is over the midle of the Columne, and that the eggs, denticles anchors and spondyles answere directly the one to the other, in good order as you may See the meas∣ures are supplied by numbers made of modules and partes of modules, the module being divided into 18 as hath bin Said architectural diagram
This Composita Pedestal keepes the proportion of the Corinthian and hath no other difference of members but in the Cymatium and basment, as may be Seene. And because the ornaments of the Composita have the Same proportion with the Corinthian, I have supposed it not necessarie to make these Columne and Arches aparte, reffering to the Corinthian Columnes and Arches. Only  given the diversitie of the Base and Capital, and other ornaments, as may be Seene in their peaces architectural diagram
This ground plat and profil of the Composita Capital, proceeds in the Same manner as the Corinthian before described, it onely differs in this, that where the Corinthian hath its Stems, the Composita hath volutas made after the Same manner with the Ionick. The ancient Romaines taking one parte of the Ionick and another parte of the Corinthian have made this Composition to vnite together as much as was possible al that which was beutiful in one onely parte architectural diagram
This peece of the Composita order, that is to Say the Capital, Architrave, frse, and Comice, is also drawne from divers places amonge the Antiquities of Rome, and is Reduced to proportion as hath bin Saied of the Corinthian which being noted with numbers is sufficiently Cleare of it selfe architectural diagram
Amonge the antiquities of Rome there are found almost infinite varieties of Capitals which have noe proper name, but may be Comprehended altogether under that general word Composita, and also they follow the principal measures of other Compositas, derived onely from the Ionick and corinthian, It is true that in Some of them we shal See the images of liueing Creatures in steade of stemes, in others Cormicopias, and in others divers other things according as they found them to Saw their purpose in their designes, as may be Iudged by this present design, the which hath 4 eagles inplase of the Stem, & in place of the slowers 4 faces of Iupiter with lightening underneath, as you may easily, that it was in a Temple consecrated to Iupiter, the Same may be Saied of the other which hath 4 griffens in place of stems, and 4 eagles in the midle with a dogg in their clawes, that it: was appropriated to som other of their Idols, ther proportion except the Images of the liuing creatures, is like to the Corinthian. This base is called Attick by Vitruvius in his 3d book and 3d chap: as being first found and put in worke by the Athenians, in our time it is vsed to be Set in worke in differently under the Corinthian Composita, Ionick and Dorick, but it hath more affinitie with the composita than with any other order, and is also tolerable in the Ionick, when wee vse not the proper base thereof, but, vnder the other orders IIudge it altogether impertinent and can giue many Reasons for it, but I wil not trouble my Selfe to Speake of things past built, with So great licence, It is sufficient in the same order as before that I Shew the Partition thereof, which ariseth from amodule divided into 18. partes, as in the Ionick and Corinthian architectural diagram
Columnes are diminished in divers manners, two whereof I Set downe here which are excep  fast and most knowne is, that the height and thicknes of the columne being terminated, and how much , at the third parte upward from the base where the lessening begins is drawne a Semicircle, and  partes of the Semicircle which are without the perpendicular lines falling on the Said circle from the lesser parte of the columne are divided into as many equal partes as you wil, and also the two thirds of the columne is divided into as many partes by transvers lines and where the perpendicular and transvers lines meete Shatbe the termes of the diminishing as may be Seene in the figure, this sorte of columne is vsed in the Tuscane and Dorick The other manner I have found of my selfe by considering, and although it be lesse knowne yet it is easie to comprehend by the lineaments, I Say onely that al the partes being terminated as is Saied, an indeterminate right line ought to be drawne at the thi  base, which begins from C and passeth by D, then taking the measure D and Setting it from A  the perpendicular in the pound, and extend AB to E where it intersects the line CD prolonged, and from E draw as many lines as  by the perpendicular to the circumference, and set the measure CD or each of these lines from the perpendicular towards the circumference both aboue, and beneath the third parle and you have the limits of the  this sorte of Columne maybe vsed in the Ionick Corinthian and Comp These Straight Columnes being drawne as you see if you  them as these are at St Peters Church at Rome you must draw the ground plat as here you see, and the Smale Circle in the midle (which is as much as you would wreath it) & divede it into 8 equal pts, and draw  lines parallel to the perpendicular then divide the whole Columne into 8 partes & forme from thence the Spiral line in the midle, which  columne from line to line as you see  you must observe that the  numbers 1 2 3 4 marked on the ground plat serves  the beginning ought to be from  you must follow the turning of the Smale Circle to  the rest you  as below architectural diagram
This Cornice,  I have  any time for the finishing of Frontispi and  found it to be very acceptable and  it be of my one invention I have not thought it impertinent to place it here at the ende f  Smale worke to satisfie those that wuld use it, the proportion with the Frontspi is thus, the whole height being divided into 11 partes, there remaines one for the Cornice and 10 for the fronti e, the re is Cleare architectural diagram
