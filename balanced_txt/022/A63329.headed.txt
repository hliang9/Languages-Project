A TRUE ACCOUNT Of the last Speeches, Confessions, AND EXECVTION OF Christopher Vrats, George Boriskie, and John Sterne, who were Tryed and found Guilty of the Barbarous Murther of Thomas Thinn Esq on the 12 of Fe∣bruary last, and Executed in the Pallmall near the place where they committed the Murther, on the 10th of this instant March. Together with the manner of their behaviours in Newgate after their Condemnations, and at the place of Execution, containing several very remarkable Passages that happened there. IT has been observed in most Ages, that offended Heaven seldom suffers Murther to be long concealed, or the Murtherers to scape unpunished, for by one means or other they are still brought to light, and Justice most deservedly takes place, as in the fatal Ca∣tastrophy of these miserable Villains, we shall more amply demonstrate, viz. of John Sterne, Christopher Urats, and George Boriskie, Executed for the base and Villanous Murther of Thomas Thinn Esq who on the 12th of February last was shot by Boriskie with a Blunderbuss as he was Riding in his Coach, which was charged with four Bullets, and they being shot into his Body at four several places, he died of the wounds within Ten hours after, and although at that time the Murtherers by the swiftness of their Horses, made their escape, and got to their Lodgings, yet such was Heavens pleasure, that they should not escape unpunished, though not one of their Faces were seen at the time the Murther was committed, so as to be known again. But Justice, as we most truely may affirm,
discovered them almost by Miracle; for not only a Pistol which one of them had with them, was found upon the place, but likewise a Chair∣man that having carried Captain Urats to the Bull-Inne in Holbourn the Morning before the Murther was committed, going accidentally in to ask him whether he would discharge him, found him charging Pistols, and upon hearing of the Murther, directed such as sought for the Mur∣therers to that House, where after a short time they found Amens Berge the Captains man, who owned the Pistol so found to be his Masters, and also upon Examination disclosed the place where he Lay, who upon his being taken, discovered the rest; who all being apprehended, upon Examination confessed the Murther, for which being commit∣ted to Newgate, after 16 days continuance there, they were brought to their Tryals at the Old-Baily, (where a Jury of half English and half Strangers being Sworn) they Pleaded not Guilty, but the Evidence be∣ing Sworn against them, and their Examinations produced, they con∣fessed the Murther, though in a different manner; Urats the Captain declared, That he having heard that the Deceased had put some affronts upon Count Coningsmark, he (as having been a Servant to his Uncle and Father) thought himself bound in point of Honour to take the Quarrel upon himself, and that he only took Boriskie and Sterne as his seconds, he being minded to Chal∣longe the Deceased. Boriskie confessed, That Captain Urats bid him fire into whatsoever Coach he stopped. And as for Sterne, he confessed, That he knew not the Designe, but only went for Company: Upon this they received sentence of Death, and were remanded to Newgate, there to continue until their Execution; since their Sentence they have been for the most part kept a sunder, and several Persons of Quality have been to visit them, and by many Arguments perswaded them to confess the real cause of the Murther, and what induced them to undertake so base and villanous an Enterprizes but especially the Captain stood obstinately (as it were) in vindicating what he had done, alleadging, That it was the Custome in their Country to Pistol any one that refuses a Challenge: And not∣withstanding the earnest Exhortations of many Pious Divines, to prepare himself for another world, he seemed very careless of their Instructions, which some persons imputed to the hopes he conceived of obtaining his Majesties Pardon, but as for the other two, viz. Boriskie and Sterne, they seemed much more concerned, especially the latter, who often retired himself from the company that came to visit them, being often seen in private at his Devotion, and much bewailing himself for the Inno∣cent Blood he had shed, wishing that he had not liv'd to have seen the day wherein the cause of his Death was effected, declaring, that he had never any Malice against the Deceased, but that he was drawn into the wicked Enterprize through the perswasions of the Captain, with whom he had first taken acquaintance in the French Kings Service. As for Boriskie that Bloody
Assassinate who discharged the Peice, he had little convers with any person, by reason he was not so well versed in the English Tongue, so as to understand what was said unto him, but being asked whether he knew the Blunderbus to be charged, by reason that up∣on his Tryal he pleaded Ignorance, he replyed, That notwithstand∣ing what he had there said (when there was some hopes of saving his Life) he well knew it to be Charged with Powder and Bullet, but with how many Bullets he was not certain, and that the Captain delivered it to him under pretence to defend him against the Esquires Footmen, in case the Esquire should come out and fight as Urats at first pretended he believed he would, but that afterwards he bid him (when he stopped the Coach) Fire into the same, or to that effect, whose unfortunate directions he followed to his own undoing; And further, that he came over in hopes of Preferment, but that now he was like to meet with such as would spoil his return. He and Sterne were very attentive at any time when Ministers came to pray with them, as past doubt not being unsensible that they had but a small remainder of life left, and that it was high time to prepare themselves for another world: Dr. Burnet not only Preached to them on Sunday last, but likewise was with them six or seven times to exhort them to a free Confession, and to shew them how they stood (as it were) upon the brink of Eternity, just ready to be pushed off, their time being limited to a certain day, and that they could not reasonably hope or expect any prolongation of their lives, who had bereaved a worthy Gentleman of his so suddainly, and to him unexpected, one from whom some of them had con∣fessed they never received any prejudice, nor had cause of conceiv∣ing any hatred, and to this effect were they daily exhorted by Pious men, who, notwithstanding their Villanous act, had a regard to their Souls. They likewise made great profession that they had been brought up in Protestant Countries, and that they had served against the Papists, but that was but a small excuse to mitigate the hainous Crime they were convicted of. The day appointed for their Execution, according to the Warrant directed to the Sheriffs, was to be on the 8th of this Instant, but at their humble request, for a longer time to prepare themselves for another world, they were reprieved till this day, when about Nine in the Morning the Sheriffs Officers came to demand them; after having had some conference with such as came to pay their last visits, were brought down by Captain Richardsons Servants, and delivered at the door of the Prison to the Sheriffs Officers, as is usual in such Cases. The Captain at his first coming down look'd very brisk, but he perceiving there was no way but that he must go to his long
home, his countenance greatly alter'd, and he many times in the way to the place of Execution, hung down his head, the other two look'd like Men whom the fear of Death had altogether stupified, so that we may perceive that such as are bold and daring to commit Murthers and bereave others of their Lives are most timerous when Death begins to stare them in the face, all along as they passed there were Crouds of People, not only in the Street, but in the Windows and Balconeys, that the like has not been seen since the Execution of their fellow Murtherers, those detested Wretch∣es that as Inhumanly and basely Murthered that Worthy Knight Sir Edmundbury Godfrey. They being come to the place of Ex∣ecution, where the Gibbets were placed as near as could be gues∣sed on the spot where the Coach stood, when the Deceased was shot, the Carts drawing under them, stood still, and being inclo∣sed round with the Guards that went to see Execution done, the Murtherers being unbound, stood up with dejected looks, several Ministers being with them, the Captain often looking wishfully a∣bout him, (as some thought) in hopes of a Reprieve; when after an hours space, having received several Exhortations, and said some Prayers in their own Language, Urats being a German, Bo∣riskie a Polander and Sterne a Sweed, the two last often lifted up their Hands, and bewailed their unhappy ends, not in the least denying the Murther, nor that they deserved to dye for the same: the Captain likewise spoke several words in French, and after they had thus done, the Executioner did his Office, where after they had Hang'd about three Quarters of an hour, they were taken down and conveyed thence.
