AESOP'S FABLES English and Latin. 1. Of the Cock. 1. A Cock, as he turn'd over a dunghil, found a pearl: saying, Why do I find a thing so bright? 2. If the jeweller had found it, none would have been more glad than he; as being one that could tell the worth of it. 3. It is indeed of no use to me, nor do I much value it: nay truly, I had rather have a barley-corn than all the Pearls in the World. 4. The Moral. Ʋnderstandly the Pearl, Art and Wisdom: and by the Cock a dotish man, and one that is given to pleasure. 5. Neither do blockish people love the Liberal Arts, seeing they know not the use of them; nor a voluptuous person; because he delighteth only in pleasure. 2. Of the Wolf and the Lamb. 1. A Wolf, drinking at a spring-head, saw a Lamb drinking a great way below. 2. He ran to it, and chid the Lamb; because it muddied the Spring. 3. The Lamb trembled, and humbly besought him, that he would spare an innocent. 4. Saying, that he, because he drank a great way below, could not in∣deed muddy the Wve's drink. much less would he. 5. The Wolf rails aloud on the contrary: Thou varlet, thou hadst a good do nothing: thou art always opposing me; thy fire, thy dam, and all thy kind whom I cannot abide to see, do what thy can to cross me. 6. I will punish thee to day. 7. Mor. It is an old saying. It is an easie thing to find a stick to beat dog with. 8. A great man if hist to hurt, doth soon ke an occasion to hurt. 9. He hath offended sufficiently, that could  resist. 3. Of the Mouse and the Frog. 1. A Mouse made war with  Frog. 2. They fought for the command of the Fen.
3. The fight was eager and hazardous. 4. The crafty Mouse, lurking under the grass, sets upon the Frog by am∣buscado. 5. The Frog being the lustier, being big-breasted and a good leaper dares his enemy to plain fight. 6. They had each of them a pike made of a Bull-rush. 7. Which conflict being soon a far off, the Kite makes haste, and whilst▪ for eagerness of fighting, neither looks to himself, the Kite snatcheth an pulleth in peices both the warriours. 8. Mor. Just so it useth to befall factious Citizens, who being inflame with a lust of ruling, whilst they strive amongst themselves to become Officer put their wealth, and for the most part their life in hazard. 4. Of the Dog and the Shadow. 1. A Dog swimming over a River carried a piece of flesh in his mouth: wh the Sun shone, so as it often falls out, the shadow of the flesh shone in water, at which, when he saw it, he catcht greedily, and lost what was in his chap▪ 2. And therefore being daunted with the loss both of the thing, and of hope, at the first he stood amazed, and afterwards recovering his spirit, barkt out thus. Poor dog, thy desire had no mean. 3. Thou hadst enough and too much, unless thou hadst been mad; and through thine own folly thou hast less than nothing. 4. Mor. By this little tale, we are put in mind of moderation, we are in mind of discretion, that there be a mean to our desire,  we lose certainties for uncertainties. 5. Verily that Sannio in Terence saith wittily, I will not buy a Pig in a Po 5. Of the Lion and some other Beasts. 1. THe Lion had covenanted with the Sheep and some others, that the pr should be common. 2. They go a hunting: a stag is taken: they divide it. 3. When several parties began to take the several pieces as they had agree the Lion roared saying, One part is mine, because I am the most worthy. 4. Likewise another is mine, because I am the strongest. 5. Furthermore, I challenge a third part, because I have swet more taking the Hart. 6. Lastly, unless you will grant me a fourth part, farewel friendsh 7. His fellows (when they heard this) went away empty and holding peace, not daing to mutter against the Lion. 8. Mor. Faith hath always been rare, in this age it is more rare, it is and always hath been very rare amongst great men. 9. Wherofore it is better, to live with thy like. 10. For he that liveth with a mightier man than himself, is necess oftimes to forgo his own right. 11. Thou shalt have equal dealing with thy equal.
6. Of the Wolf and the Crane. 1. THe bones by chance stuck in the throat of a Wolf, that had worried a Sheep. 2. He goeth about, he intreateth help, but no body helpeth him. 3. Every body said, He was rightly serv'd for his greediness. 4. At the last, he perswadeth the Crane with many fair words, and more promises; that with her great long neck, being put into his throat, she would take out the bone that stuck in it. 5. But he mockt her, when she desir'd something for her pains; Thou fool (quoth he) go thy way, hast thou not enough that thou livest? Thou art beholding to me for thy life. 6. If I had listed, I might have bit off thy neck. 7. Mor. It is an old saying, that it is thrown away, which thou dost to an ungrateful person. 7. Of the Country-Man and the Snake. 1. A Country-man brought home a Snake which he had found in the Snow almost starved to death and laid it before the fire. 2. The Snake recovering strength and poison from the fire, and afterwards not abiding the heat, filled all the Cottage with hissing. 3. The Country-man, having got up an Hedge-stake, runs to him, and takes him up roundly for the wrong done him, both with words and strokes. 4. Would he thus requite him? 5. Would he offer to take away his life that had given him life? 6. Mor. It sometimes comes to pass, that they do thee hurt, whom thou hast done good to; and deserve ill at thy hands, from whom thou hast well deserv'd. 8. Of the Boar and Ass. 1. WHilst the idle Ass mocked the Boar, he chafed at him and gnasht his teeth. 2. Thou very idle Ass, thou hast deserved smart; but although thou art worthy of punishment, yet I scorn to punish thee. 3. Mock on and spare not, thou may'st do it scot-free. 4. For thou art safe, because of thy idleness. 5. Mor. Let us endeavour, that when we bear or endure things that do not beseem us, we may not speak or do things that do not beseem us. 6. For naughty and ungracious persons, for the most part, are glad if any good man oppose them; and they count it a great matter that they are thought worthy to have revenge taken on them. 7. Let us imitate Horses and great Beasts, which pass by barking currs with contempt. 9. Of the City-Mouse and Country-Mouse. 1. THe City-Mouse had a mind to walk abroad into the Country. 2. The Country-Mouse saw her, and invites her home, gets things ready, and they go to supper.
3. The Country-Mouse fetcheth out whatsoever she had laid up against Winter, and brings out all her store, that she might satisfie the daintiness of such a great guest. 4. Notwithstanding the City-Mouse knitting her brows, condemns the poor∣ness of the Country, and withall commends the plenty of the City. 5. As she goes back, she brings the Country-Mouse with her into the City; that she might make good in deed, what she had brag'd of in words. 6. They go to the Feast, which the City-Mouse had gallantly provided. 7. As they are at their cheer, the noise of the Key is heard in the lock. 8. They trembled, and ran away as fast as they could. 9. The Country-Mouse being both unused to it, and unacquainted with the place, had much ado to save her self. 10. When the servant was gone away, the City-Mouse comes again to the table, and invites the Country-Mouse. 11. He creeps out of his hole. having scarcely got shut of his fear, at the last. 12. He asks the City-Mouse that invited him to drink, whether this danger was often or no. 13. He made answer, that it was every day, and ought to be slighted. 14. Then quoth the Country-Mouse, Is it every day? 15. Truly thy dainties have more bitter than sweet in them. 16. Indeed I had rather have my want with security, than that abun∣dance with such trouble of mind. 17. Mor. Riches indeed make shew of pleasure, but if you look into them, they contain danger and bitterness. 18. There was one Eutrapelus, who when he would do his enemies the greatest mischief, made them rich, using to say, he thus took revenge on them; for they were like to receive with their Riches a great burden of cares. 10. Of the Eagle and Jack-Daw. 1. AN Eagle having got a Cockle could not get out the fish by force or art. 2. A Jack-daw coming to her, gives her counsel. 3. He perswades her to fly upwards, and to throw down the Cockle from on high upon the Rocks, for so it would come to pass, that the shell would be broken. 4. The Jack-daw tarries on the ground to watch for it's fall, the Eagle throws it down, the shell is broken, the Jack-daw snatcheth up the Fish, the Eagle is sorry to see her self couzened. 5. Mor. Do not trust every body; and be sure thou eest into the Counsel which thou takest of others. 6. For many being asked their advice, do not give advice for them that ask them, but for themselves. 11. Of the Raven and the Fox. 1. A Raven having got a prey, croaked amongst the boughs. 2. A Fox saw her hopping to and fro, he runs to her. 3. The Fox, quoth he, bids the Raven many good morrows. 4▪ I had often heard, that Hear-say was a lier, and now I find it to be so indeed. 5. For as I came this way by chance espied you in the tree, I make hast towards you and blame the rumour.
6. For the report goeth; that you are as black as pitch, and I see you are whither than Snow. 7. In mine opinion truly you out-strip the Swans, and are fairer than the pale Ivy. 8. And if you excell in your voice, as you do in your feathers, truly I would say, yet were the Queen of Birds. 9. The Raven, being allured with this flattering tale, makes her ready to sing. 10. But the Cheese fll out of her bill as she made her ready, which when he had snatcht up, the Fox sets up a laughter. 11. Then the poor Raven was asham'd and vext at her self, and was grieved for the loss of the thing, blushing at it withall. 12. Mor. Some are so greedy of commendation, that they love a flatterer to their shame and loss; such men are a prey to flatterers. 13. But if you will avoid boasting, you may easily avoid that plaguy kind of flatterers. 14. If thou wilt be Thraso, thou shalt not want a Gnatho. 12. Of the Lion that was past his strength for age. 1. A Lion, which in his youth had made many his enemies through his fierceness, was punished for it in his old age. 2. The Beasts pay him in his kind, the Boar gnasheth him with his tushes, and the Bull goars him with his horns. 3. But especially the little Ass, being desirous to put away the old name of slothfulness insults over him in words and kicks him lustily. 4. Then the Lion, sighing, said, These whom I have long ago done hurt to, now do me hurt, as I did them, and good cause why: but those whom I have sometimes done good to, now do me no good as I did them; nay, indeed they set themselves against me without any cause. 5 I have been a fool to make many my enemies, but a greater fool to trust to false friends. 6. Mor. In prosperity be not lifted up: be not curst. 7. For if fortune change her Face, they, whom thou hast done hurt to will be revenged on thee. 8. And see thou puttest a difference amongst thy friends. 9. For there are some friends that are not thine, but thy table's, and thy fortune's; which fortune so soon as it shall be altered, they will be altered too. 10. Thou shalt be well dealt withall, if they be not thine enemies. 11. Ovid complains not without cause. Lo I, that erst had many friends, Whilst with the wind and tide I went; As soon as ever the sea did swell. Was left 'ith midst with vessel rent. 13. Of the Dog and the Ass. 1. WHilst the Dog fawned upon the Master and the Family, the Master and the Family cherished the Dog. 2. The little Ass seeing that, fetched a deep sigh; it begun to irk him of his condition: He thought it was not fairly carried, that the Dog should be welcom
to all, and be fed at his Master's Table and get that by idleness and play: and that he on the contrary, should bear pack-saddles, should be beaten with a whip should never be out of work; and yet be hated of every body. 3. If these things were done with fawning, he resolved to follow that trade which was so profitable. 4. Therefore to try the matter, he runs to meet his Master one time, as he was coming home again; he leaps upon him and knocks him with his hoofs. 5. When the Master cryed out, the servants ran to him; and the foolish Ass that thought he was mannerly, was beaten with a cudgel. 6. Mor. We cannot all do all things as Virgil saith, in his Bucolicks: no do all things become all persons. 7. Let every one covet that, let him strive to do that; which he can do. 8. For we know that, which is more signifi cantly said in Greek, Onos Ly an Ass of Harps [or of an Harp] but Boetius hath it thus. An Ass set t an Harp. 9. Labour is vain, if nature be against it: Nor say, nor do, thy nature bing averse, as Horace witnesseth. 14. Of the Lion and the Mouse. 1. A Lion being weary with heat and running, rested him under a shadow upon the green leaves. 2. And as a company of mice ran over his back▪ he awaked, and caught one of many. 3. The prisoner humbly beseeches him, and cries, that she is unfit with who the Lion should be angry. 4. And he considering, that there was no commendation to be got, by kiling such a little small beast, lets the prisoner go. 5. Not very long after, the Lion by chance, as he ran along the Fore lights into the Nets; he might roar, but he could not get out. 6. The Mouse hears the Lion roaring pitifully, she knows his voice, she cre into the holes under ground, she seeks for the knots of the snares: she finds the having sought for them; she knaws them in pieces when she found them. Thu the Lion escapes out of the Nets. 7. Mor. This Fable perswades clemency to great Men. 8. For, as humane affairs are inconstant, sometimes great men themselve want the help of the meanest. 9. Wherefore a discreet man, though he can, will be loth to hurt a me body; but he that is not loth to hurt another, is exceeding foolish. 10. Why so? Because, though whilst he presumes upon his power, he fears body; yet perhaps, time will come, that he may fear. 11. For it is certain, it hath befallen renowned and great Kings, that eith they have stood in need of the favour of mean Persons or been afraid of the displeasure. 15. Of the sick Kite. 1. A Kite kept her bed, being just ready to dye. 2. She intreats her dam to go and pray to God for her. 3. Her dam answered, she could expect no help from God, whose holy thi and Altars she had so often desiled with her ravenings.
4. Mor. It behoves us to reverence God; for he helps the godly, and with∣standeth the ungodly. 5. Being slighted in prosperity, he hears not in adversity. 6. Wherefore in prosperity think on him, that he may be ready when he is called on in adversity. 16. Of the Swallow and other Birds. 1. AS soon as ever the Line was begun to be sown, the Swallow perswades the small birds to hinder the sowing; saying, that snares were making for them. 2. They mock her, and call the Swallow a foolish Prophet. 3. When the Line was now grown up, and green, she adviseth them again to pull up the crop by the roots. 4. They mock her again. 5. The Line waxeth ripe, she exhorteth them to spoil the crop as it stood. 6. And when they would not hear her then neither giving them advice, the Swallow, having left the birds company gets into man's favour; she makes a league with him, dwells with him, and cheers him with her song. 7. Nets and snares were made of the Line for the other birds. 8. Mor. Many neither know how to advise themselves, nor do they hear one that gives them good advice. 9. But when they undergo dangers and losses, then at the last they begin to be wise, and to blame their own want of wit. 10. Then they have enough and too much advice: This and that (quoth they) should have been done. 11. But it is better to be Prometheus, than Epimetheus. 12. These were brethren: their names are Grecian. 13. The one had advice before a thing, and the other after a thing: which the Etymology of their names doth manifest. 17. Of the Frogs and their King. 1. THe nation of the Frogs, when it was free, besought Jupiter that they might have a King given them. 2. Jupiter laught at the petition of the Frogs. 3. Yet they pressed often upon him, till they made him to do it whether he would or no. 4. He threw down a great Clog. 5. That heavy thing makes a great plunge in the River. 6. The Frogs being affrighted, hold their peace: they do homage to their King. 7. They come nearer by little and little: at the last, having cast away fear they leap upon it, and leap down from it. 8. The idle King is a sport and a scorn to them. 9. They petition Jupiter again; they intreat they may have a King given them that may be valorous. 10. Jupiter gives them ae Stork. 11. He, walking very stoutly up and down the Fen, devours what ever of the Frogs come in his way. 12. Therefore the Frogs complained of his cruelty in vain. 13. Jupiter doth not hear them, for they complain even yet to this day.
14. For when the Stork goes to his rest at even, they come out of the holes, and make an hoarse croaking, but they talk to one that hears them no 15. For Jupiter's mind is, that they that petitioned against a gracio King should now endure one that had no mercy in him. 16. Mor. It useth to befall the common people, just as it did the Frogs; wh if they have a King a little more mild, they find fault with him, that he slothful and idle, and that they may once have a man of valour. 17. On the contrary, if at at any time they have a King that hath mett in him, they condemn this King's cruelty, and commend the clemency of th former. Whether it be, because we always grow weary of things present, because the saying is true, That new things are better than old. 18. Of the Pigeons and the Kite. 1. THe Pigeons once had war with the Kite, whom, that they might be abl to bear, they chose the Hawk to be their King. 2. He when he was King plays the enemy, not a King. 3. He catcheth and pulleth them in pieces, as fast as the Kite did. 4. The Pigeons repented them of their doing, and thought it was better to endure the Kite's war, than the Hawk's tyranny. 5. Mor. Let it irk no body too much of his condition. 6. There is nothing (witness Horace) happy on every part. 7. Truly, I would not desire to change my condition, so it were but tolerable. 8. Many when they have got a new condition have again wished for the old. 9. We are almost all of us, of such a fickle disposition that we grow weary of our selves. 19. Of the Thief and the Dog. 1. A Dog one time answered a Thife, that reached him bread, that he would hold his tongue, I know thy treacherous intentions: thou givest me bread, that I may leave barking. 2. But I scorn thy gift, because if I shall take the bread, thou wilt carry things out of these houses. 3. Mor. Have a care you lose not a great matter, for a little profit's sake. 4. Take heed how you trust any body. 5. For there are many, that not only speak you fair, but also do you a courtesie, with a treacherous meaning. 20. Of the Wolf and young Sow. 1. A Gilt (or young Sow) pig'd. A Wolf promiseth, that he would look to her litter. 2. The Sow that had Pigs answers, That she needed not the Wolf's humble service. If he would be accounted dutiful, if he desired to do her a pleasure, he should go further off. 3. For the Wolf's office consisted not in being by, but being away. 4. Mor. All things are not to be trusted to all men. 5. Many men offer their service, not for love of thee, but of themselves seeking their own benefit, not thine.
21. Of the Mountains bringing forth Young. 1. THere was once a Report, that the Mountains were in travel. 2. Men ran to them, and stood about them, looking for so Monster with extream fear. 3. At the last, the Mountains bring forth, there comes out a Mou 4. Then they were all ready to die with laughing. 5. Mor. Horace toucheth on this little tale. The Hills bring forth, a silly Mouse is born. 6. It also notes bragging. 7. For bragging persons, when they profess and boast of great mat∣ters, scarce perform little matters. 8. Wherefore those Thraso's are rightly the subject of jests and scoffs. 9. Likewise this tale forbids vain fears. 10. For, for the most part, the fear of danger is worse than the danger it self, nay it is a thing to be laughed at, which we fear. 22. Of the Hound that was despised by his Master. 1. THe Master set on a Hound, which was now grown old; h cheers him up in vain, his feet are slow, he makes no haste. 2. He had caught hold of a Deer; the Deer got from him, being that he wanted teeth. 3. His Master rates him with blows and words. 4. The Dog answers, that he ought to be pardoned by right, that he was now grown old; but that he had been a stout Dog, when he was young. 5. But as I perceive, saith he, you like nothing without profit▪ you loved me when I was young, and able to catch the Game, you cannot abide me now I am slow and without teeth. 6. But if you were thankful, you would love him that is old fo his profitable youths sake, whom you loved once when he was young for profits sake. 7. Mor. The Dog said well. 8. For, as Ovid witnesseth, Nothing but what brings profit is esteem'd; Take th' hope of it away, no man is deem'd. 9. There is no remembrance of a good thing past, and no grea love of one to come; the main respect is to the good thing present▪ It is unfit to say, but truth to tell, The Rabble judgeth love by profit well. 23. Of the Hares and the Frogs. 1. WHen the Wood roared with a whirl-wind, that had not used t be, the fearful Hares began to run away apace. 2. And when a Fen was in their way as they ran, they stood sti being doubtful what to do, and in danger on both sides. 3. And, that which was an occasion of great fear, they saw th Frogs to be under the water in the Fen. 4. Then one of the Hares being more wise than the rest, and mo eloquent said; Why do we fear, and need not?
5. We have need of courage. 6. We have nimbleness of body, but we want metal in us. 7. This danger of the whirle-wind is not to be avoided, but to neglected. 8. Mor. In every thing we have need of a spirit. 9. Valour lies flat without Confidence. 10. For Confidence is the leader, and queen of Valour. 24. Of the Kid and the Wolf. 2. WHen the Goat was going to feed, she shut up her Kid home, warning her to open the door to no body till she can back again. 2. A Wolf, that had heard that a good way off, after the Da was gone, knocks at the door, speaks like the Goat, and bids hi open the door. 3. The Kid perceiving his knavery aforehand, saith, I will open the door; for though thy voice be like the Goat's, yet truly see a Wolf through the Chinks. 4. Mor. It is good for them, that children obey their parent and it becomes a young man to give ear to an old man. 25. Of the Hart and Sheep. 1. AN Hart accused a Sheep before a Wolf, crying out, that ought him a bushel of Wheat. 2. The Sheep indeed was ignorant of the debt; yet, because the Wolf's being by, she promiseth that she would give it. 3. A day is appointed for the payment, it comes, the Heart p the Sheep in mind. 4. She denies it. 5. For that she had made such a promise, she excuseth that was done for fear, and because of the Wolf's being by. 6. That an oath forced from one was not to be kept. 7. Mor. It is a sentence of Law, We may keep off force by for 8. Out of this little Fable a new one comes: We may refel de by deceit. 26. Of the Countrey-Man and the Snake. 1. A Countrey-man had nourished a Snake. 2. And being angry on a time, he struck the beast with an 3. He got away, but not without a wound. 4. Afterwards the Country-man coming to poverty, thought t misfortune befell him because of the wrong he had done to the Sna 5. Therefore he beseeches the Snake that he would come again. 6. He saith, that he forgave him, but would not come ag neither should he be safe with the Country-man, who had su great ax at home; that the blewness of the wound was ceased, the mernory for all that remained. 7. Mor. It is scarce safe to trust him again, that hath broken his word. 8. It is indeed a point of pity to forgive a wrong; but it
27. Of the Fox and the Stork. 1. A Fox invited a Stork to supper. 2. He poured the meat upon the Table, which, because it wa thin, the Fox licked up, the Stork striving in vain to do so wit her bill. 3. The Bird being abused, went her way; she was both ashamed and grieved at the injury. 4. After a few days, she comes again and invites the Fox. 5. A glass was set full of meat; which vessel, because it wa narrow-mouthed, the Fox might see the meat, and be hungry but he could not taste of it. 6. The Stork easily drew it out with her bill. 7. Mor. Laughter deserve laughter, Jesting, jesting, Knaver knavery, and Deceit, deceit. 28. Of the Wolf and the painted Head. 1. A Wolf tumbles over a man's head, which he found in a Grave shop, he wonders at it, perceiving (just as it was) that it ha no sens 2. He saith, O fine head. 3. There is in thee a great deal of Art, but no sense at all. 4. Mor. Outward beauty is pleasing, if there be inward. 5. But if we must want either, he is better, that wanteth t outward, than the inward. 6. For that sometimes without this incurs hatred, so that a fo is so much the more disliked, by how much the fairer he is. 29. Of the Cornish-Chough. 1. THe Cornish-Chough decked her self with a Peacock's feather. 2. And afterward seeming to her self pretty handsom scorning her kind, she went to the Peacocks. 3. They at the last, understanding the deceit, stripped the fooish bird of her colours, and beat her. 4. Horace, in the first book of his Epistles, tells this little t of a Jack-daw. 5. He saith, she was once made fine with feathers gathered which had fallen from other birds, but afterwards she was ridi∣lous, when every one of the birds had pulled her own feathers from 6. Lest if perchance each bird should come and take Her own feathers, the Daw should laughter make, Being stript of her stoln colours— 7. Mor. This little tale noteth those, that behave themselv more loftily than is fitting; that live with them that are b richer, and more gentile, than themselves; whereupon they of become poor, and are made a mocking-stock. 8. Juvenal doth well advise us: Gnothi seauton, down from heaven did come, that is, Kn thy self. 30. Of the Flie and the Pismire. 1. THe Flie was at a contest with the Pismire; she bragg'd that she was base; that her self did
that she crept, that her self dwelt in Kings Palaces, that she lay in holes in the ground; that she gnawed the corn; and drank water; that her self feasted it bravely, and yet got these things with ease. 2. On the other side, the Pismire said, That her self was not base, but was content with her birth; that the Flie was a wanderer, but her self was constant to a place; that corn and running water did reth with the Pismire, as well as Pasties and wine did with the Flie; and that herself did not get these things by slothful idleness, but by diligent labour. Furthermore she said that the Pismire was merry and safe, beloved of all; and, to conclude, was a pattern of labour. But that the Fle was full of cares, was set at by all with the danger of her life; that she was hated by all, and to conclude, was a pattern of sloth. That the Pismire being mindful of winter, did lay up food, that the Flie did live but from hand to mouth, and was either like to endure hunger, or certainly to die in winter. 3. Mor. He that goes on to say what he lists, shall hear those things which he lists not. 4. The Flie had heard his own commendation, if he had given good language. 5. But I yild my consent to the Pismire. 6. For a mean life with security seems more desirable, than a brave life with danger. 31. Of the Frog and the Ox. 1. A Frog being desirous to match an Ox,  out her self. 2. The young one exhorted the Dam, to give over what she had begun, because a Frog was nothing to an Ox. 3. She swelled the second time. 4. The young one cries out, Mother though you burst, you shall never be too hard for the O. 5. But when she had swelled the third time, she burst. 6. Mor. Every one has his gift. 7. This man exceeds in beauty, that in strength, this is potent in wealth, that in friends. It becomes every one to be content with his own. 8. He hath an able body, thou a strong wit. 9. Wherefore let every one advise with himself: and let him not envy his better, which is a poor thing; nor desire to contst with him, which is a point of folly. 32. Of the Horse and the Lyon. 1. A Lyon came to eat up a Horse: but wanting strength for old age, he began to practise a trade; he professeth himself a Doctor, he staies the Horse with a long story. 2. The Horse opposeth knavery to knavery, and cunning to cunning. 3. He feigned that he had pricked his foot of late in a thorny place: He intreats him, that being a Physician, he would look up∣on it and pull out the thorn. 4. The Lyon yields to him. 5. But the Horse with all the force he could, gives the Lyon.
6. The Lyon scarcely recovering himself, at the length (for he wa almost killed with the blow) saith, I am rightly served for my folly, and he hath worthily escaped: for he hath revenged knavery with knavery. 7. Mor. Dissembling is worthy to be hated, and is to be caugh by dissembling. 8. An enemy is not to be feared, that shews himself an enemy but he that when he is an enemy, pretends good will is to be fear∣ed at the length, and exceedingly deserves to be hated. 33. Of the Horse and the Ass. 1. A Horse being finely trapped and fadled, ran along the way, neighing apace. 2. And by chance a laden Ass stood in his way as he ran. 3. The Horse fretting for anger, and —Fiercely chafing on the frothy bit. 4. Thou slow and idle Ass, quoth he, why dost thou hinder the Horses way? 5. Get out of my way, I say, or I will kick thee. 6. The Ass not daring to bray to the contrary, giveth way and sayeth nothing. 7. Now the Horses cods burst, as he was frisking and mind∣ing his career. 8. Then being not good for a Race, or a Shew, he was deprived of his braveries, and after that was sold to a Carman. 9. The Ass sees him afterwards coming with a Cart, and speaks to him. 10. Good Sir! what furniture is this? 11. Where is your gilded saddle, and your studded girths? where is your gay bridle? 12. Thus it might needs happen, friends, to you that was so proud. 13. Mor. Many are puft up in prosperity, and neither remember themselves nor modesty, but because they grow proud in prosperity, they fall into adversity. 14. I would advise them that seem to be happy, to be wary: for if the wheel of fortune be but turned about, they will find it to be a most miserable kind of misfortune to have been happy. 15. This mischief also adds to their unhappiness, they shall be scorned of them whom they scorned: and they whom they have laughted at, will jeer them. 34. Of the Birds and the four-footed Beasts. 1. THe Birds had a Battel with the four-footed Beasts. 2. There was hope on both sides, fear on both sides, and danger on both sides. 3. Now the Bat having for saken her fellows went to the enemies. The Birds get the better, The Eagle being their Captain and Leader. 4. And they condemned the runagado Bat. That she should never come again to the Birds, and that she should never flie in the day time.
5. This is the reason for the Bat, that she never flies but by night. 6. Mor. He that refuseth to be sharer with his fellows in adversity and danger, shall have no share of prosperity or safety. 35. Of the Wolf and the Fox. 1. THe Wolf, when he had prey enough, lived in idleness. 2. The Fox comes to him, and enquires the reason of his idleness. 3. The Wolf perceived, that treachery was intended towards him: he made as though sickness was the reason: he intreated the Fox to go and pray to the gods for him. 4. She being sorry that her cunning, did not take, goes to a shep∣herd, and informs him, That the Wolf's kennel lay open, and that an enemy being secure might be taken at unawares. 5. The shepherd sets upon the Wolf, and kills him. 6. The Fox enjoys the kennel and the prey. 7. But she had but small joy of her roguery; for not very long after the same shepherd took her too. 8. Mor. Envy is an ugly thing, and sometimes also destructive to the Author. 9. Horace in the first book of his Epistle saith, At others weal an envious man doth fret. Sicilian Kings than envy never yet Invented greater torments— 36. Of the Hart. 1. A Hart beholding himself in a clear fountain, he approves of the lofty and branched horns of his forehead: but he condemns the slenderness of his legs. 2. By chance, whilst he looketh on them, and whilst he passeth judg∣ment on them, the Hunter comes upon him: the Hart runs away Swifter than arrows, swifter than the wind, That drives the clouds. 3. The dogs pursue him as he runs. 4. But when he had entred into a thick wood, his horns were entangled in the boughs. 5. Then at the last he commended his legs, and condemned his horns, which made that he became a prey to the dogs. 6. Mor. We desire things that are to be avoided, and we avoid things that are to be desired. 7. The things which do us hurt, please us: and the things which do us good displease us. 8. We desire happiness, before we understand where it is. 9. We look after abundance of wealth, and height of honours: we suppose happiness to be placed in these things, in the which not∣withstanding is a great deal of labour and sorrow. 10. That same Lyrick Poet of ours expresseth it handsomely, The tallest Pines are over-blown, The loftiest Towers are overthrown, The highest Hills are smitten down
37. Of the Viper, and the File. 1. A Viper finding a File in a Smiths shop, began to gnaw it. 2. The File smiled saying, What thou fool, what dost thou do? 3. Thou shalt wear out thy teeth, before thou canst wear me, which am wont to bite of the hardness of the brass. 4. Mor. Be sure to see with whom thou hast to do. 5. If thou whettest thy teeth against one stronger than thy self, thou shalt not hart him but thy self. 38. Of the Wolves and the Lambs. 1. I Here was once a covenant betwixt the Wolves and the Sheep, amongst whom there is naturally discord, hostages being given on both sides. 2. The Wolves gave their Whelps, and the Sheep their company of Dogs. 3. Whilst the Sheep were quiet and feeding, the young Wolves set up an houling for the want of their dams. 4. Then the Wolves rushing upon them, cryed out, that their faith and covenant was broken, and they pull in pieces the Sheep, that were destitute of the guard of the dogs. 5. Mor. It is folly, if in a league thou deliver the things that keep thee safe, to the enemy. 6. For he that hath been an enemy, hath not yet perhaps ceased to be an enemy: and peradventure he may take occasion to fall upon thee, being deprived of thy safeguard. 39. Of the Wood, and the Countryman. 1. AT what time also the Trees spake, a Countryman came into a Wood; he intreated it that he might have leave to get a shaft for his ax. 2. The Wood consented. 3. The Countryman, when his ax was fitted, began to cut down the Trees. 4. Then, and indeed too late, it repented the Wood of its readi∣ness to do a courtesie: it was sorry that it self was the cause of its own destruction. 5. Mor. Have a care to whom thou dost a good turn. 6. There have been many, that after they have received a cour∣tesie have abused it, to the undoing of the bestower of it. 40. Of the Members, and the Belly. 1. THe foot and the hand once accused the belly, because their gains were consumed by it, that would not work. 2. They bid that it should either take pains, or else that it should not desire to be maintained. 3. It beseeched them, once or twice. 4. Yet the hands deny it sustenance. 5. The belly being empty for want of meat, when all the limbs be∣gan to be feeble, then at last the hands would be officious: but that was too late. 6. For the belly being weak for lack of use
7. So all the Limbs, whilst they envied the belly, died with th belly when it died. 8. Mor. As it is in the society of the members, so is humane society. 9. A member stands in need of a member, and a friend stands i need of a friend. 10. Wherefore we must make use of mutual offices, and mutual la∣bours: neither do riches nor titles of honour sufficiently defend a ma 11. The only and main guard is the friendship of many. 41. Of the Ape and the Fox. 1. AN Ape intreateth a Fox, that he would bestow a piece of hi tail on her to cover her uocks: for it was a burthen t him, which would be of use and an honour to her. 2. The Fox answers, That he had nothing too much, and that h had rather have the ground swept with his tail, than the Ape buttocks to be covered with it. 3. Mor. There are some that stand in need, and there are some tha have too much;  no rich men have that fashion, to comfor poor men with the superfluous means. 42. Of the Stag and the Oxen. 1. A Stag running away from the hunter, betook himself into a beast-house: he intreateth the O en, that he might lie hid in the cratch. 2. The Oxen said he could not be safe; for the master and the ser∣vants would be there presently. 3. He said, he was secure, if so be they would not betray him. 4. The servant comes in, and doth not see him hid in the hay, he goes his way out. 5. The Stag begins to be jocund, and to fear nothing. 6. Then one of the Oxen being grave both for his age and advice, saith, It was an easie thing to deceive this fellow, that is (as blind as) a Mole: but how thou canst lie hid from our master, who is (as quick-sighted as) Argos, This is the toil, this is the work. 7. Presently after a while comes in the master, who, that he might correct the servants negligence, viewing every thing with his eyes, and trying what was in the cratch with his hand, caught hold of the Stag's horns under the hay: He calls upon his servants, they run to him, they inclose the Deer, and take him. 8. Mor. In adversities and dangers, lurking places are hard to be found: whether it be, because Fortune vexeth poor men, as she begun: or because they being hindred with fear betray themselves through in∣discretion. 43. Of the Lyon and the Fox. 1. THE Lyon was sick, the living creatures came to visit him: only the Fox deferred his service. 2. The Lyon sends a messenger to him with a Letter, which wish∣ed him to come; saying that his only presence would be very accepta∣ble to the Lyon, and that there would be no danger why the Fox should .
3. Besides, that he himself was sick and lay by it, so as though h would do him harm (a thing that was not) yet he could not. 4. The Fox writes back, That he desired, that the Lyon might recover▪ and that he would pray to God for that; but he would not come and se him, for he was affrighted with the foot steps. 5. Which foot-steps, for asmuch as they are all towards the Lyon' en, and none from it wards, that matter was a token, that many li∣ving creatures went in, but none came out. Horace saith, 6. What once the Fox to the sick Lyon said, I will relate: The feeting made me 'fraid, Which all look to thee wards, but none look back. 7. Mor. Beware thou do not trust words; unless thou dost tak heed, thou shalt often be beguiled. 8. Thou mayest guess at men both by their words and deeds, and by the deeds the words are to be judged. 44. Of the Fox and the Weesel. 1. A Fox being lean with long fasting crept by chance through a narrow hole, into a corn wisket; in which when he had well fed, hi teg'd belly hindred him, as he strove to go out again. 2. A Weesel, a good way off seeing her striving, at the last tellet her, If she had a mind to go forth, she should come lean again to th hole, which she got in at when she was lean. 3. Mor. You may see many to be pleasant and chearful in a mean con¦dition, being void of cares, and free from the troubles of the mind. 4. But if these men become rich, you shall see them to go heavily, an never to shew a merry look, being full of care, and overwhelme with troubles of the mind. 5. Thus Horace sings this tale in the first Book and seventh Epistle. A Fox by chance crept through a little hole, Into a basket, that had store of grain: And having fed, he strove with's belly full, To get out thence again, but all in vain. A Weesel bids him, if he thence would pass, Go to the hole lean, as at the first he was. 45. Of the Horse and the Stag. 1. A Horse made war with a Stag. 2. And being beaten at the last out of the pastures, he be sought ma he 3. He comes back with a Man, he goes down into the plain field and he that was overcome before, is now made conqueror. 4. But for all this when the enemy was overcome, and brought uder, the Victor himself could not chuse but obey the Man. 5. He carrieth a rider on his back, and a bridle in his mouth. 6. Mor. Many strive against poverty, which when it is overcome fortune and industry, the conqueror's liberty is often lost. 7. For being Lords and Masters of poverty, they begin to serve are tormented with the sourge of covetousness, they are h with the bridle of sparingness  neither do they keep a mean in .
8. Horace speaks of this, in the first Book of his Epistles, and the tenth Epistle. The Stag did beat the Horse out of the field, Who found himself too weak, but, loth to yield, He crav'd man's help, and underwent the rein; But having quell'd his foe by might and main, The rider from his back he could not get, Nor bit out of his mouth, but bears them yet; So e that poverty doth strive to flie, Wants, that's than gold more precious, Liberty; The wretch his Master bears; a slave is he, That cannot with a little content be. 46. Of two young Men. 1. TWo young men, make as though they would buy meat at a Cooks. 2. Whilst the Cook was doing other things, the one snatcheth a piece of flesh out of the basket, and gives it to his fellow, that he might hide it under his cloaths. 3. The Cook, as soon as he saw a piece of flesh to be gone out of the basket, began to charge them both of theft. 4. He that had taken it away, swore by Jove, that he had nothing; and he that had it swore often, that he took nothing away. 5. To whom the Cook said, truly the thief now is unknown to me, but he by whom you have sworn saw, and knoweth him. 6. Mor. If we do any thing amiss, men do not presently know it; but God, who sitteth above the heavens, and beholdeth the bottomless depth, seeth all things. 7. Which if Men do but consider, they will sin more closely and warily. 47. Of the Dog, and the Butcher. 1. WHen a Dog had stoln a piece of flesh from a butcher in the sham¦bles, he ran presently away with it as fast as he could. 2. The butcher being daunted with the loss of the thing, at the first held his peace; afterwards, when he came to himself, he called to him thus a great way off, O thou arrant thief, run secure thou maist with∣out any danger, for thou art sure now, because of thy swiftness; but here∣after thou shalt be watched more narrowly. 3. Mor. This fable signifieth, that almost all men become then at last more wary, when they have sustained loss. 48. Of the Dog, and the Sheep. 1. A Dog commenced an action against a sheep, bawling that she ought him a loaf which he lent her. 2. The Sheep denieth the Action. 3. The Kite, the Wolf, and the Vulture are sent for; they affirm the thing. 4. The sheep is cast; the dog taketh her away hastily, and fleaeth her being cast. 5. Mor. Both every one knows, and this little tale doth very well.
49. Of the Lamb and the Wolf. 1. A Wolf met a Lamb that kept company with a He goat: he ask'd him, Why having left his Dam, he rather followed a stinking He-goat; and per∣swades him, that he would go again to his Dam's dugs, that strutted out with milk; hoping that so it will come to pass that he should pull him in pieces, being drawn aside. 2. But he said, O Wolf, my Dam committed me to him: an especial care to look after me is committed to him. I must obey my parent rather than thee, who desirest to draw me aside by these words, and by and by to pull me in pieces, being drawn aside. Mor. Do not trust all men, for many, whilst they seem to be willing to do others good, consult for themselves in the mean time. 50. Of a young-Man and a Cat. 1. WHen a young Man took delight in, and loved a Cat, he wearied Venus with intreaties, that she would turn the Cat into the shape of woman. 2. Venus pitied and heard him when he prayed: There is made a change of the shape, which liked the young man, being deeply in love, very well. For∣sooth, she was all pretty sappy, all pretty white, all pretty handsome. 3. And not very long after, the goddess, desiring much to try whether the Cat had changed her manners also with her body, lets in a little mouse, down through the little Court. 4. There befel a thing that very much deserved laughter and sport. 5. The little woman presently makes after the little beast, when she saw her. 6. Venus taking it ill, changed the woman's look into a Cat. 7. Her hands to feet, her arms to thighs turn'd thus, A tail is added, and she's made a Puss. 8. Mor. They change the air, not mind, that o'er-sea run. 9. And it is too hard a thing to leave the things one is used to. 10. Horace saith: Though Nature with a fork thou dost expell, Yet will it still recoil. 51. Of the Husband-man and his Sons. 1. A Husband-man had a great many young men to his Sons, and they were at discord amongst themselves; whom the father striving to perswade to love one another, when he had laid down a bundle of sticks, he bids every one severally break it, as it was tied together with a short Cord. 2. The weak youths strive in vain. 3. The father looseth it, and gives to every one a little rod; which when every one, according to their little strength, easily brake, he said, O little sons, no body will be able to overcome you, if you hold thus together. 4. But if you will wound one another, and make civil war, ye will be at the last a prey to the Enemies. 5. Mor. This Apologue teacheth, that small means increase by concord, and great means waste to nothing by discord.
52. Of the Country-Man and the Horse. 1. A Country-man brought along the way a lere Horse, and an ass soundly loaden with fardels. 2. The little ass being weary, intreats the horse, that he would help him with his loading, if he would save his life. 3. The Horse saith, He would not do it. 4. The little Ass at the length, being tired with the weight of his pack lyeth down and dyeth. 5. His Master layeth all the load, and the skin of the dead ass too, upon the Horses back. 6. With which, when he was pressed down, he saith, O me poor wretch, I am now thus tormented according to my own desert, who would not e're while help the ass, that was over loaden. 7. Mor. We are admonished by this tale, to help our friends that are op∣pressed. 8. Our Country (saith Plato) challengeth a part of our birth to it self, and our friends a part. 53. Of the Collier and the Fuller. 1. A Collier invited a Fuller to dwell with him in one house. 2. The Fuller saith, My friend, that is neither pleasure nor profit to me, for, I greatly fear, lest what I wash clean, thou mayest make as black as a coal is 3. Mor. We are admonished by this tale, to walk with blameless persons; we are admonished, to avoid the company of wicked men, as a plague. 4. Company, saith Campanus, draws men; and acquaintance also screw∣eth into mens behaviour; and every one becometh just such, as they with whom he converseth. 54. Of the Fowler and the Ring-dove. 1. A Fowler went a birding; he seeth a Ring dove a great way off, making her nest in a very high tree; he makes haste: Lastly, he lays wait to hit her; he treads upon a snake with his heel. 2. He stung him. 3. He being affrighted with the sudden harm, saith, Woe is me, poor man! whilst I lye in wait to deceive another, I my self am utterly undone. 4. Mor. This little tale signifieth, that they are sometimes beguiled by their own crafts, who attempt alteration in a State. 55. Of a Trumpeter. 1. A Trumpeter was taken by the Enemies, and led away. 2. He trembled, and besought them to spare a harmless person: He said that he, for as much as he never bare any arms, except a Trumpet, could not indeed kill a man, much less would he. 3. They on the contrary spake roughly against him, both with a cruel muttering and blows.
4. Thou Rogue, thou hadst as good say nothing; thou doest hurt most of all, and thou shalt now be hanged here: because whereas thou (as thou confeffest) art unskilled in military affairs, thou stirrest up, and settest on other mens courage. 5. Mor. Some offend most grievously who advise Princes, that are otherwise prone enough to mischief, to do unjustly, and do buz into their ears some such words as these. 6. What do you make any question? Have you forgot that you are a Prince? May not you do what you list? You are greater than the Law: The name of a Law-breaker can scarce light upon you, who do bear sway even over the Laws themselves. 7. Your Subjects have nothing which is not yours. You are able both to save and to destroy. It is lawful for you, to make him wealthier, or more honourable, whom you think good. It is lawful for you to take away his wealth and honour when you please. 8. Some things condemn or commend other men: Every thing will be very commendable for you. 56. Of the Wolf and the Dog. 1. A Wolf meets a Dog, as it chanced, in the wood, before it was light; he asketh him how he doth, he is glad to meet him: and at the last asketh him how he came to be slick. 2. To whom he said, my Masters care hath done this: for my Master cherisheth me, when I fawn upon him, I am fed from my Masters most fine Table, I never use to sleep in the open air; and besides, it cannot be said how all the family make much of me. 3. Truly saith the Wolf, thou art very happy, Dog! that hast light upon such a kind and gentle Master, with whom, O I could wish too, that I might dwell; then no living Creature in the World should be more happy than I. 4. The Dog, seeing the Wolf to be very desirous of a new condition, pro∣miseth that he would bring it about, that he should find some respect from his Master, so he would but abate some of his old fierceness, and undergo service: 5. He is resolved; It pleased the Wolf to walk along to the farm-house: they have a great deal of very pleasant discourse upon the way. 6. And afterward when it grew light, the Wolf espying the Dogs neck worn bare, said, O Dog, what ails that neck of thine, with the hair all off it? 7. I used, said he, being somewhat fierce, to bark at, and sometimes to bite strangers as well as friends: and my Master, not enduring that, did often beat me, forbiding me withal to set upon any but a Thief or a Wolf. 8. I am overmastered and made more mild, by being thus beaten, and I have kept this mark of my inbred churlishness. 9. The Wolf, when he heard this, saith, I will not buy thy Masters friend∣ship at such a rate. 10. Therefore farewell, Dog, with that slavery of thine: my own liberty is better for me. 11. Mor. It is more desirable to be master in a mean cottage, and to eat brown bread, than to enjoy dainty cheer in a stately palace, and to be liable to danger, and live in fear. 12. For liberty is banished out of a great house, where wrong must be taken and passed over in silence.
57. Of the Husband-Man and the Dogs. 1. A Husbandman after he had wintred a good many days in the Country, began at the last to want necessaries; he killed his sheep, and after a while his she goats: and last of all, he kills his oxen too, that he might have something wherewithal to maintain his body, that was almost fa∣mished. 2. When the Dogs saw that, they resolved to save themselves by run∣ning away; for they should live no longer, seeing their Master did not so much as spare the Oxen, whose labour he made use of in doing his Coun∣try-work. 3. Mor. Have a care into what house you put your self for wages. 4. Some Masters are very unkind. 5. For many now a days are grown so mad, that they are ready to kill even their servants, for any misfortune, harm or damage. 58. Of the Fox and the Lyon. 1. A Fox, which was not used to the Lions fierceness, having by chance seen that Living Creature once or twice, did tremble and run away. 2. As soon as ever the Lion came and met him the third time, the Fox was so far from fearing any thing, that he went boldly to him, and saluted him. 3. Mor. Use makes us all more bold, even towards them whom we durst scarce look at before. 59. Of the Fox and the Eagle. 1. A Fox's Cub ran abroad; being caught by an Eagle, it calls to its dam to help it. 2. She runs, and intreats the Eagle, that he would let go her Cub, being taken prisoner. 3. The Eagle having got a prey, flieth to her young ones. 4. The Fox pursueth her with a fire stick which she snatcht up, as though she would burn down her strong hold. 5. As soon as ever she had climbed up the tree, she saith, and now then defend thy self and young ones if thou canst. 6. The Eagle trembling whilst she feared her house burning, said Spare me and my young ones, and I will restore whatever I have of thine. 7. Mor. By the Eagle understand men of a powerful and daring Spirit, by the Fox understand poor folks, whom rich folks endeavour all alike, to cavil with, and revile: 8. But, seeing the Pismires also have their spleen, those weak people sometimes do handsomly revenge a wrong which they have received. 60. Of the Husband-man and the Stork. 1. WHen the cranes and geese ate up the sown Corn, the Country man set a snare for them: the Cranes were taken, and the Geese were taken, and a stork also was taken.
2. She beg'd hard for her self, crying out, that she was one that did no hurt, and was neither crane nor goose, but the best of all birds, because she used always to do all that ever she could for her father, and to maint ai him when he was very aged. 3. None of these things, quoth he, are unknown to me; but, forasmuch as we have taken thee with them that did hurt, thou shalt die likewise with them 4. Mor. He that committeth a naughty fact, and he that keepeth com∣pany with them that are naught, are punished both alike. 61. Of the Cock and the Cat. 1. A Cat came to eat up a Cock; and having not reason enough to do him hurt, he begins to accuse the Cock, saying. That he was a bird that troubled others with his noise, because he wak'd men when they were asleep in the night, with such a shrill voice. 2. He said, he was innocent, seeing he thus called up men to their work. 3. The Cat in the mean time spake earnestly against him; Thou Villain, thou hadst as good do nothing; thou liest with thy mother, and dost not refrain from thy sister. 4. When the Cock endeavoured to clear himself of that too, the Cat going on still in a rage, saith, Neither shall this avail any thing; I will pull thee all in pieces to day. 5. Mor. William Gauden saith, It is an old saying, One may quickly find a stick to beat a dog withal. 6. A naughty man, if he list, will undo you, whether by right or wrong. 62. Of the Shepherd and the Husband-men. 1. A Boy kept sheep in an open meadow; and when he cryed out in jest many times, that the Wolf was there, he raised the husbandmen on all sides. 2. Whilst they, having been too often made fools of, do not come to help him, when he craved their aid in good rnest, the sheep became a prey to the Wolf. 3. Mor. If any one be used to lie, he will scarcely be believed, if at any time he shall begin to tell the truth. 4. That jest in Horace, in the seventeenth Epistle of his first Book concerning Planus the jester, is very like the foregoing Apologue. 5. He that was once befool'd, will not assay. To help lame Planus up in the cross-way, Though many a tear he shed, and do protest By his god Apis, I am not in jest: Believe me, stony hearts, and your help lend To one that's lame. Get some to help thee, friend, That knows thee not, thy neighbours all do cry, We know thy cheats, and for us thou maist lie. 63. Of the Eagle and the Crow. 1. AN Eagle flyeth down from a very high rock. upon the back of a Lamb▪ 2. The Crow seeing that, thinks it fine sport, like an ape, to imitate th
Eagle; he lets himself down upon a ram's fleece; being let down, he is made fast by the feet; being fastned by the feet, he is caught: being caught he is thrown to the boys. 3. Mor. Let every one esteem himself, not by others, hut his own worth. 4. Take measure of thy self by thy own foot, saith Horace. 5. Desire that, and attempt that, which thou art able to perform. 64. Of the Envious Dog and the Ox. 1. A Dog lay in a rack of Hay. 2. An Ox came to eat. 3. The Dog rousing himself up, hindred him. 4. The Ox saith, a mischief on thee, with that envy of thine, who neither dost eat the hay thy self, nor sufferest me to eat. 5. Mor. A great many are of that disposition, that they envy to another that which they cannot attain to for want of understanding. 65. Of the Jack-Daw and the Sheep. 1. A Jack-daw chattered upon a Sheeps back. 2. The Sheep said, if thou shouldst so chatter to a dog, thou shouldst have some mischief done thee. 3. But the Jack daw said, I know over whom I insult; I am troublesome to them that are quietly disposed, and friendly to them that are fierce. 4. Mor. Bad men are always ready to contest with a weak and honest man. 5. Every one that is most innocent, is dashed against the ground, but no body crieth out against a mischievous and hasty man, in his own hearing. 66. Of the Peacock and the Nightingale. 1. THe Peacock complaineth to Juno, the sister and wife of great Jupiter. that the Nightingale sang sweetly, but that she was laughed at by every body, for her hoarse squawling. 2. To whom Juno made answer, Every one hath his gift from god: the Nightingale far exceedeth in singing, and thou in feat hers: It becometh every one to be content with his own lot. 3. Mor. Let us thankfully accept what God hath given us, and not seek greater matters. 4. God doth nothing rashly. 67. Of the old Weesel and the Mice. 1. A Weesel, wanting strength by reason of his old age, was not now able to follow after the mice, so as he was used to do: he begins to devise a cunning trick, he hides himself in an heap of meal, thus hoping, that he might hunt without any labour. 2. The mice run to him, and whilst they have a mind to eat the meal, thy are all every one devoured by the Weesel. 3. Mor. Where one is destitute of strength, he hath need of wit. 4. Lysander the Lacedemonian, was ever and anon wont to say, that the Fox's
fur was to be eked to that, where the Lions skin would not reach. 5. Which you may express more clearly thus, where down-right dealing cannot prevail, sleight must be used. 68. Of the Country-man and the Apple-tree. 1. A Country-man every year got very well relisht Apples off an Apple-tree, which he had in a Close hard by: he presented the choicest to his Master, that was a Citizen: who being taken with the incredible sweetness of the apples, removed the apple-tree at last to his own home. 2. The tree being very old, withered all on a suddain; and there the ap∣ples, as well as the apple-tree, were lost. 3. Which when it was told the Master of the house, he said, Alas, it is an hard matter to remove an old tree; it had been enough, and too much (if I had known how to bridle mine appetite) to pluck the fruit from the boughs. 4. Mantuan hath thus expressed this little tale in verse. A Country-man some sweeting pull'd, And to his Lord them gave; Who, much delighted with the fruit, The tree near home would have. But it being old, soon withered, And with it's Apples dy'd: Alas, 'tis no removing trees Thus old, the good man cry'd. 5. Mor. Such men are fools, that are too wise, And things not fit require: But he is wise, that wotteth how, To curb his own desire, 69. Of the Lyon and the Frog. 1. A Lyon thought he heard a noise; he started at it; he stood still, not with∣out trembling, expecting some great matter. 2. At the last, a little Frog came out of the water. 3. The Lyon having laid aside his fear, made hast, and trode the little beast under his feet. 4. Mor. This little tale forbiddeth vain fears, as doth that tale concern∣ing the labour of the Mountains, translated by William Gaudane. 70. Of the Pismire. 1. A Pismire being thirsty, comes to a spring to drink; she falls by chance into the spring-well, a Pigeon helps her a good way off, by throwing a bough out of the tree; the Pismire getting upon the bough is saved. 2. A Fowler comes, that he might catch the Pigeon; the Pismire doth not suffer him; she bites the Fowler by the foot, and the Pigeon flies away. 3. Mor. This fable teacheth us very well, that we must requite courtesies done to us.
71. Of the Peacock and the Magpy. 1. WHen the Nation of the birds roved up and down at their own liberty, they wished they might have a King given them. 2. The Peacock thought himself as worthy as the best to be chosen, because he was the fairest. 3. When he was chosen to be King the Magpy saith, O King, if the Eagle begin stoutly to pursue us, as she is wont, whilst you reign, how will you drive her away? How will you do to save us? 4. Mor. The shape is not so much to be looked at in a Prince, as the strength of body: He hath need of discretion. 72. Of the Sick-man and the Physician. 1. A Physician had a sick man in cure, but he died at the last. 2 Then saith the Physician to his kinsfolks, This man died through intemperance. 3. Mor. Ʋnless one leave drinking and Venery betimes, he shall either never come to be old, or have but a very short old age. 73. Of the Lyon and others. 1. THe Lyon, the Ass and the Fox go on hunting: good store of game is taken, and being taken it is ordered to be divided. 2. As the Ass laid several shares out for every one, the Lyon roared, he takes the Ass and pulls him in pieces. 3. Afterwards, he bids the Fox do it: who being more crafty, when he had hardly reserved the least share for himself, having laid aside the best piece by far for the Lyon, the Lyon asked him, who had taught him thus to do? 4. To whom he said, the ruine of him hath taught me, pointing at the dead Ass. Mor. He's happy who takes heed by others harms. 74. Of the Kid and the Wolf. 1. A Kid peeping out at a window, did dare to revile a Wolf, as he pas∣sed by. 2. To whom the Wolf said, Thou Villain, it is not thou that revilest me, but the place. 3. Mor. Both time and place do ever add confidence to a man. 75. Of the Ass. 1. AN Ass complaining of the Gardiner's cruelty, intreated Jupiter, that he might have another Master given him. 2. Jupiter heard the Ass's prayers, and gives him a Brick-layer, with whom when he carried bricks, and heavier loads on his back, he came again to Jupiter, and intreated one might be given him that was more mild. 3. Jupiter laughed at him. 4. Yet he never gave over urging, and intreating so far, till he made him do it
5. He gives him a tanner; whom when the Ass knew throughly, he said, Wo is me poor wretch, who, whilst I am content with no master, have light up∣on him, who (as far as I guess) will not spare my very skin. 6. Mor. We always condemn things present, and desire new things, which (as the Proverb goes) are not better than the old. 76. Of the old Woman and the Maids. 1. AN old woman had a great many maids at home, whom she calld up to their work every day, before it begun to be light, at the crowing of a cock, which she kept at her house. 2. The maids being vex'd at last, with the wearisomness of their daily business, cut off the cock's head, hoping that now he was killed, they should sleep till noon, but this hope failed the poor girls. 3. For their Mistress, as soon as she knew that the Cock was killed, bad then to rise at midnight ever after. 4. Mor. Many, whilst they strive to shun a great evil, fall into anoth quite contrary. 5. It is a very common saying: Who fain would shun the one extreme, Into the other falls. 77. Of the Ass and the Horse. 1. THe Ass thought the Horse was happy, because he was fat and lived idlene's, But he said that himself was unhappy, because he was lea and hide-bound, and made use of every day by an harsh Master, to carry load▪ 2. Not long after they cryed to arms. 3. Then the Horse. A rider from his back did not repell, Nor bridle from his mouth, nor shafts that fell Upon his body— 4. The Ass, when he saw this, gave god many thanks, that he had made him an Horse, but an Ass. 5. Mor. They are miserable, whom the common sort judge happy: a many are happy, that think themselves very miserable. 6. The Cobler saith, the King is happy whom he seeth to have all thi at his will; not considering about what matters and cares he is distract whilst himself in the mean time sings with his honest poverty. 78. Of the Lyon and the she-Goat. 1. A Lyon having by chance espyed a she-Goat walking on a very rock, advised her that she would come down rather into the gr meadow. 2. The Goat said, I should do so perhaps, if thou wert away: who not  persuade me, that I should take any pleasure thereby, but that thou have something to devour, being ready to starve for hunger. 3. Mor. Trust not all men. 4. For, some do not advise for thee, but for themselves.
79. Of the Vulture and other Birds. 1. THe Vulture maketh as though she would keep her birth-day every year; she invites the little Birds to the Feast. 2. They almost all come: she entertains them when they come with great tokens of joy and respect: but the vulture teareth them in pieces, after they were entertained. 3. Mor. All are not friends that speak one fair, or say, that they are willing to do one a courtesie. 5. Hereupon saith Ovid. Oft under hony, sweetest poisons lurk. 80. Of the Geese. 1. THe geese spoiled the ground with the Cranes; which when they were heard the Country folks rose presently upon them. 2. The Cranes as soon as they espied the Country-folks, flew away, but the Geese were caught, which being hindred with the weight of their body could not get away. Mor. When a City is taken by the enemies, a poor man easily gets away; but a rich man being taken prisoner is made a slave. In time of war riches are rather a burden than of any use. 81. Of Jupiter and the Ape. 1. WHen Jupiter had a great mind to know, what mortal Wights had the prettiest young ones, he gave order, that whatever living Creatures there were any where, they should be called together. 2. They flock to Jupiter from all parts. 3. All sorts of birds and beasts were now there; amongst which when the Ape also came, carrying her ill-favoured cubs in her arms, none could forbear laughing: nay more, Jupiter himself laughed very excessively. 4. Then by and by, quoth the Ape herself, Yea Jupiter also our Judge knoweth, that my young ones do quite out-strip all as many as be here. 5. Mor. Every one thinks his own the fairest, as the proverb saith. 9. And elsewhere in Theocritus, in his Eidyls. What is not fair, so to the lover seems. 82. Of the Oak and the Reed. 1. THe Oak being ence full of disdain and insolency too, set upon the Reed, saying, If now thou hast any mettle in thee come on and fight, that the end of us two may shew whether is the stronger. The Reed, nothing wondering at such great bragging of the Oak, and idle vaunting of his valour, answered thus, I will not now ight, neither am I sorry for my condition. 3. For although I be moveable to every side yet I overcome the shrill storms: But thou, if once King Aeolus should let out the winds that struggle in a vast cave, wilt fall down together-ward, and then I shall laugh at thee. 4. Mor. This fable sheweth, that they are not alwaies the most valiant
who (even unprovoked by any injury) do insult over others. 83. Of the Fisherman and the little Fish. 1. A Fisherman having thrown a baited hook into the water, pulled out a little Fish. 2. The prisoner intreated and besought him, that he would let him, being but a very small one, go away, and grow to its full growth, that he might have him afterwards when he was bigger. 3. The Fisher said, I will not buy the Pig in the Poke: because I was always of that disposition, that I choose to get whatever I can for the present. 4. Mor, This little fable admonisheth us, that we should not at any time forgo things certain, for the hope of things uncertain. 5. For what is more fond, than, as it is in Tully, to have uncertain things instead of certain? 84. Of the Pismire and the Grashopper. 1. WHen winter drew near, the Pismire hurried corn into the barn floor In the Sun-shine. 2. The Grashopper seeing that, she ran to her and beg'd a Grain. 3. The Pismire said, why dost not thou also by my example, hurry what thou canst in Summer, and add to the heap? 4. She answered that she spent that time in singing. 5. The Pismire smiling said, If thou usest to sing in Summer, thou art worthy to starve now. 6. Mor. We are put in mind by this little fable, whilst yet we have strength of body, to get those things, whereby our feeble old age may be maintained. 85. Of the Lyon and the Bull. 1. A Bull fled from a Lyon, and light upon an He-goat: he made at him with his horns and frowning look. 2. To whom the Bull, being exceeding angry, said, thy sower countenance doth not affright me, but I am afraid of an huge Lyon: who if he were not just behind me, thou shouldst know now, that it is no such small matter to fight with a Bull, and the Blood to follow from my wound. 3. Mor. We must not add calamity to them that are in calamity. 4. He is sufficiently miserable, that is once miserable. 86. Of the Nurse and the Wolf. 1. A Nurse threatned a boy that cryed, that he should be given to the Wolf, unless he held his peace. 2. The wolf by chance heard it, and tarried at the door in hope of meat. 3. At the least, the Boy grew still, as sleep came upon him. 4. The Wolf goth back into the wood, fasting and empty. 5. The Fox asketh him, where his prey is? 6. The Wolf sighed, and said, I was beguiled: a Nurse threatned to throw away a Boy that cried; but she deceived me.
7. Mor. Credit is not to be given to a woman. 87. Of the Tortoise and the Eagle. 1. THe Tortoise was grown weary of creeping. If any one would lift her up into the skie, she promiseth him orient pearls. 3. The Eagle took her up. 4. He demands his reward. 5. He pinched her with his tallns, because she had nothing. 6. Thus the Tortoise, which coveted to see the stars; lost her life among stars. 7. Mor. Be content with thy condition. 8. There have been some, who if they had remained low, might have been safe; but being set up aloft have come into danger. 88. Of the Crab-fishes, the Old one and the Young one. 1. THe dam adviseth the Crabfish that went backward, that he would go forward. 2. The Young one answered, Mother go before and I will follow. 3. Mor. Blame no body for a fault, for which thou maist be blamed thy self. 89. Of the Sun and the North-wind. 1. THe Sun and the North-wind try, whether was stronger. 2. They agreed to try their strength upon a traveller, that he should bear the bell away, that could make his cloak fall off. 3. The North-wind sets upon the Traveller with an horrible roaring storm; but he makes no stay, but doubles his Cloak about him and went on. 4. The Sun takes strength, which, when the storm was overcome by little and little; casteth forth gleams. 5. The Traveller begins to wax hot, to sweat, to puff and blow. 6. At the last, not being able to go forward he stands to take the cool air and having cast off his Cloak he sits him down under a tree full of laves: and so the Sun got the victory. 7. Mor. Be sure to have a care, with whom thou strivest. 8. For although thou beest strong, yet perhaps there is another stronger than hee; or if not stronger, yet more cunning, so as by his policy he can overcome hy strength. 90. Of the Ass. 1. AN Ass comes into a wood, and finds a Lyon's skin; with which being clad he goes back into the pastures, and affrights the flocks and herds, and ak's them run away. 2. He that had lost him comes, and looks up and down for his Ass. 3. The Ass, as soon as he saw his Master, runs to meet him; nay rather, he uns upon him with his roaring. 4 But his Master having caught hold of his cars, that stood out, said, My tle Ass, though thou deceivest others, yet I know thee very well.
5. Mor. Do not make folks believe that thou art, what thou art not: make them not believe that thou art learned, when thou art unlearned: do not brag that thou art rich and noble, when thou art beggarly and base. 6. For, when the truth is found out thou wilt be laughed at. 91. Of the Frog and the Fox. 1. THe Frog went out of the marsh, and professed Physick in the woods, a∣mongst the wild beasts. 2. She said, she would neither yield to Hippocrates nor Galen. 3. When others believed her, the Fox stouted her. 4. Shall she, quoth he, be accounted skilful in Physick, that hath such a pale look? 5. But let her cure her slf. 6. And thus the Fox jeered her; for the frog hath a face of a wan colour. 7. Mor. It is a point of folly, and a ridiculous thing, to profss that which thou knowest not. 92. Of the Dog that would bite. 1. HIs Master tied a little bell to a dog that bit folks ever and anon, that every one might look to himself. 2. The Dog supposing, that his honour was given for his virtue, scorned those about him. 3. There comes to this dog, one that was grave in years and reputation, advising him, that he would not mistake himself; For that bell, saith he, is given thee for a disgrace, not a grace. 4. Mor. A bragging fellow somtimes thinks that is for his commendation, which is for his discommendation. 93. Of the Camel. 1. A Camel being ashamed of himself, complained, that the bulls went brave with their two horns, but that he was exposed without defence, to other beasts. 2. He intreats Jupiter to bestow horns on him. 3. Jupiter laughs at the folly of the Camel, and doth not only deny his desire, but also crops his ears. 5. Mor. Let every one be content with his fortune. 6. For, many having pursued a better fortune have come by the worse. 94. Of two Friends and a Bear. 1. TWo friends make a journey: and a Bear meets them on the road. 2. The one having got into a tree, avoids the danger; the other, when there was no hope of escape, laid himself flat on the ground. 3. The great beast comes to him, and feels him, and searcheth at his mouth and his ears 4. When the man held his breath and motion, the bear, which spares dead folks, supposing it was a dead corps, goeth his way without doing him any hurt. 5. When his fellow asked him afterwards, what the beast rounded him in his
ear, as he lay, he said, he advised him this, That he should never go a journey with such like friends. 6. Mor. Truth is as rare a bird as the Black Swan. 7. Adversity and perils shew a true friend. 95. Of the bald Knight. 1. A Bald Knight had fastened a perewig to his cap. 2. He came into the plain field, when a sharp North-wind blew; and when he did not well heed his periwig, his baldness appeared on a suddain. 3. The company about him set up a laughter, and he laughed himself also. 4. What strange matter is it quoth he, for other mens hair to flie off, when those that were my own have faln off long ago? 5. Mor. The Knight did prettily, who was not angry, but laughed at them that laughed at him. 6. And Socrates when he had got a box on the ear, in the Market, an∣swered on this fashion. That it was a vexation, that men did not know, when they should come abroad with an head-piece. 96. Of the two Pots. 1. TWo Pots stood upon the bank-side, the one was an earthen one, and the a brass one, and the force of the River took them both away. 2. The brass one answered the earthen one, that feared a knocking together, that it should not fear any thing; for it self would take care sufficient, that they might not be knocked together. 3. Then the other said, Whether the stream dash me against thee or thee a∣gainst me, both will be done to my peril. Wherefore I am resolved to get farther from thee. 5. Mor. It is better to live with an equal companion, than with a mightier. 6. For thou maist be in danger of a mightier man, and not he of thee. 97. Of the Country-man and Fortune. 1. A Country man when he was at plow, found a pot of money in a furrow, he thanked the earth that had afforded him it. 2. When fortune saw that no honour was given to her, she said thus with her self: 3. When the treasure is found, the blockish fellow is not thankful unto me, but when the same treasure is afterwards lest, he will solicit me more than all with his prayers and cries. 4. Mor. When we have received a good turn, let us be thankful to him that hath done us a pleasure. 5. For ingratitude is worthy to be deprived even of a benefit, which it hath but lately received. 98. Of the Bull and the he-Goat. 1. A Bull fld from a Lyon: he came to a Cave seeking a place to lie hid in. 2. An he-goat that was within, push'd at him as he went in, with his horns▪ 3. Then the bull roared out these expressions, thou indeed dst push at me, now
that I fly; but if he shall go away whom I flee from, thou shalt then understand, how much an he-goat differeth from a bull's strength. 4. Mor. The he-goat, is one that knoweth not, that poor folks must be holpen, or at least not hurt. 5. For whosoever shall not refrain from wronging poor folks, if, as fortune is mutable, poor folks come again to be happy, he shall cer∣tainly be sorry, that he hath harmed poor folks. 99. Of the Ape and its Young. 1. JUpiter had commanded all living Creatures to appear in his sight, being to judge whose young was the fairest. 2. The wild beasts hasten, the birds flie, and the fish also swim to the contest. 3. The Ape comes in haste, the last of all, drayling her young one with her. 4. At the ugly buttocks of which young, when every one laughed, she said thus, Let him win whom Jupiter shall like best; yet for all that, in my judgment, this Cub of mine is a pretty one, and ought to be pre∣ferred before all others young ones. 5. At this saying even Jupiter himself smiled. 6. Mor. Both we and our own things like our selves. 7. But let other men judge concerning us, and our doings, lest if we our selves judge, we be laughed at as the Ape was. 100. Of the Peacock and the Crane. 1. THE Peacock and the Crane supped together. 2. The Peacock vaunted of her self, shewed her tail, and scorneth the Crane. 3. The Crane confesseth, the Peacock had fine feathers; but that she her self cuts through the clouds with her stout flight, whilst the Pea∣cock has much adoe to flie over a house. 4. Mor. Let no man despise another. 5. Every one hath his portion, every one hath his vertue. 6. He that wanteth thy vertue, perhaps hath that which thou wantest. 101. Of the Oak and the Reed. 1. THE Oak being broken down by a strong South-wind, was thrown into a river; and, as it swum, stuck by chance with his boughs upon a Reed. 2. It wonders, that the Reed stood safe in such a whirlwind. 3. It made answer, That she was safe by yielding and giving way; that she bended at the South-wind, and North-wind, and every blast. 4. And that it was no wonder, that the Oak-fell down, which desired not to yield but to resist. 5. Mor. Resist not a more powerfull man, but overcome him by yield∣ing and suffering. 6. Which the most elegant Poet Virgil expresseth neatly. Which way the fates do drive, thou gallant man, Let's move; by suffering is a way we can Conquer all fortune.
102. Of the Tyger and the Fox. 1. A Hunter darted at wild beasts. 2. The Tyger bids all wild Beasts stand away, and said, that she onely would make an end of the war. 3. The Hunter darteth on. 4. The Tyger is forthwith wounded. 5. The Fox asked her, as she fled out of the battle, and drew out the dart, Who had so much wounded a lusty beast? 6. She made answer, That she did not know the causer of her wound; but that she guessed by the greatness of the wound that it was some Man. 7. Mor. Stout men are for the most part rash; but skill overcometh force, and with strength. 103. Of the Bulls, and the Lyon. 1. THere were four Bulls that resolved to live and die one with another. 2. A Lyon espyed them feeding together, and although he was hungry, yet, he was afraid to set upon them all together. 3. First, he laboured by cunning words to part them; and then he tears them in pieces being parted. 4. Mor. Nothing is more strong than concord: discord maketh even strong men weak. 104. Of the Fir-tree and the Brambles. 1. THE Fir-tree is reported, to have once despised the Brambles; it brags that it was tall, was placed in buildings, and that it stood in ships with a sail; but that the brambles were low and base, and fit for no service at all. 2. Whose answer was on this manner, Thou Fir-tree, for soth, dost glory in thine own good things, and dost insult in our ills. 3. But thou dost not relate thine own ills, and thou omittest our good things. 4. When thou art cut down with a sounding ax, O how thou couldst then wish, thou wert like us that are secure. 5. Mor. Both high fortune hath its evil, and low fortune its good things. 6. That I may say nothing else, this is secure and safe; but that is neither without fear, nor without dangen. 7. Horace sings in his Lyrick verses, The loftiest towers are o'er born, With greater falls; high hills are torn With thunder. 105. Of the Fisher and the little Fish. 1. A Little fish being pull'd out with a hook intreats the fisher, that he would let it escape. 2. It said it was but newly spawned by its dam, and that it should not do much good at a table, seeing it was but yet a very small one: If he would let it go, it would come again afterwards of its own mind to his hook, when it was a good big one. 3. The fisher said, He would not forgo a certain booty though it was but a very little one.
4. What I have, quoth he, I know; what I may have I know not: I will not forgo a bird in the hand for two in the wood. 5. Mor. A thing certain is better than an uncertain; a thing present is better than that which is to come: although sometimes a small pro∣fit being let go hath brought a great one. 106. Of the Bird and her young Ones. 1. A Bird advised her young ones, being laid in standing corn, that they would be sure to mind, if any thing was spoken concern∣ing the season [or reaping time] whilst she was away. 2. The young ones being sad, told the dam, when she came back again from feeding, that the Landlord had let that work to his neighbours. 3. She made answer, that there was no danger. 4. Likewise on another day, being in a fright, they told her, that his friends were intreated to come and reap. 5. She bids them again be quiet. 6. The third time, as soon as ever she heard that the Landlord and his Son were resolved, the next morning to begin to shear; Now, quoth she, it is time for us to get away. 7. I did not fear the neighbours and friends, because I knew they were not like to come. 8. But I fear the Landlord, for he hath a care of the business. 9. Mor. The most of us are slothfull in other mens business: but, if thou would'st have any thing well looked to, put it not over to an∣other, but look to it thy self. 107. Of the Covetous and the Envious man. 1. TWo men prayed to Jupiter, a covetous man, and an envious man. 2. Jupiter sends Apollo to satisfie their desires: he grants them both liberty to wish what they would, on this condition, that what thing soever the one requested, the other should receive it double. 3. The covetous man makes a stand a great while, because he thinks nothing will be enough. 4. At the last, he asked a many things, and his fellow received double. 5. Now then, the envious man desired this, That he himself might lose one of his eyes, being glad that his fellow should be punished with the loss of both. 6. Mor. What can satisfie Covetousness? 7. But nothing is madder than envy, which, so that it may hurt an∣other, wisheth it self a mischief. 108. Of the Lyon and the she-Goat. 1. A Lyon saw a she-Goat hanging upon a rock full of brambles. 2. He persuades her to come down, to crop the thyme, and the willows in the plain ground. 3. The she-goat refuseth to come down, making a loud answer, that his words indeed were not ill, but his mind was full of knavery. 4. Mor. Consider who persuades you to any thing. 5. Many persuade thee to things that are good, not for thee, but for themselves.
109. Of the Crow and the Pitcher. 1. A Thirsty Crow found a Pitcher of water; but the pitcher was too deep for the Crow to reach to the water. 2. He strives to pour out the pitcher, but he was not able to doe it. 3. Then he puts in pebble stones, which he gathered out of the Sand: and by this means the water is raised, and the Crow drinks. 4. Mor. Sometimes thou shalt doe that by wisdom and advice, that thou canst not doe by force. 110. Of the Lyon and the Hunter. 1. A Lyon wrangleth with an Hunter. 2. He preferreth his own strength beyond a mans strength. 3. After long disputes, the Hunter brings the Lyon to a stately Tomb, wherein a Lyon was engraven, laying his head upon a mans knee. 4. The beast said, that was not evidence enough. 5. For he said, Men engrave what they list: but if Lyons also were crafts-masters, a Man should be engrauen under the Lyons feet. 6. Mor. Every one as far as he can, both saith and doth what he thinketh may advantage his own party and cause. 111. Of the Boy and the Thief. 1. A Boy sat at a well weeping. 2. A thief asked him the cause of his weeping. 3. The boy said, that the rope was broken, and a pitcher of gold was fallen into the water. 4. The man stript himself, and leaped into the well and looked. 5. When he could not find the Vessel, he came up again, and could neither find the boy nor his coat there. 6. Because the boy had taken his coat, and run away. 7. Mor. They are deceived sometimes, that use to deceive others. 112. Of the Country-man and the Bullock. 1. A Country-man had a bullock that would neither abide tying nor yoking. 2. The man being somewhat cunning, cuts off the beasts horns, for he snag'd with his horns, then he yoked him, not to the wain, but to the plow, lest as he was wont, he should kick his Master. 3. He holds the plow himself, being glad that by his pains he had brought it to pass, that he could now be safe from his horns and hoofs. 4. But what became of it? the bullock every like resisting, fills the Country-mans head and face with sand, by scraping it abroad with his feet. 5. Mor. There are some so intractable, that they cannot be dealt withall by skill or any policy.
113. Of the Satyr and Traveller. 1. A Satyr, which was formerly accounted the god of the woods, taking pity of a Traveller, that was covered with the snow, and starved with cold, brought him into his cave and cherished him with a fire. 2. And as he blew his hands, he asked him the reason; who made answer, and said; That they may be warm. 3. Afterwards, when they were set down, the Traveller blew his fried barley; and being asked why he did it, he said, That it may be cold. 4. Then the Satyr presently casting out the Traveller, said, I will not have him to be in my Cave, that hath a mouth of so contrary tempers. 5. Mor. Take heed you live not with a double tongued man, and one that is a Protus in his talk. 114. Of the Boar and the Country-man. 1. THE Country-man cut off the ear of a Boar, that spoiled his corn. 2. He cut off the other ear of him, being found a second time. 3. He caught him when he came again, for all that; and then carried him, being caught, into the city, as intended for a dainty to his Lord. 4. Now when the beast was cut up at the table, the heart was not to be found. 5. When the Master chased, and asked the Cooks earnestly for it, the Baily answered; My Lord, it is no wonder that the heart is not to be found, I think the foolish boar never had any heart. 6. For, if he had had any heart, he would never have returned so often to my corn, to his own smart. 7. Thus said the Country-man. 8. But all the guests were ready to die with laughing, and set up a loud laughter at the folly of the Country-man. 9. Mor. Many mens life is so witless, that you may make a question, whether they haue a heart or not. 115. Of the Bull and the Mouse. 1. A Mouse had bitten a Bull by the foot, and run into her hole. 2. The Bull shakes his horns, and seeks for the enemy, but could not see him any where. 3. The mouse mocks him, and saith, Because thou art strong and big, thou must not therefore scorn every body. 4. Now a little mouse hath hurt thee, and that indeed without re∣compence. 5. Mor. That proverb is thread bare, which I would express more significantly in our own tongue, Let no man be too heedless of his ene∣my. In Latin thus: Nemo hostem suum flocci pendat. 116. Of the Country-man and Hercules. 1. A Country-mans waggon stuck fast in the deep clay. 2. He presently lay all along, and besought the god Hercules to help him. 3. A voice thundred from heaven; it saith, Thou feel, whip thy horses, & set
thy shoulders to the wheels, and then call Hercules. 4. For then Hercules will come if he be called. 5. Mor. Idle wishes do no good, which verily God doth not heed. They say, Help thy self, and then God himself will help thee. 117. Of the Goose. 1. THere was a Goose which layed golden eggs, every day one. 2. The owner, that he might become rich on a sudden, killeth the goose, hoping that a treasure lay within her. 3. But when the goose was found empty, the poor man was amazed, and from thence forward sighed heavily, and took on, that both the thing and the hope of it, were lost. 4. Mor. Our desires are to be moderated. We must have a care, that we be not over hasty, or too greedy: for, both too much haste doth hurt, and he that seeketh for more than is fitting, doth oftentimes get nothing. 118. Of the Grashopper and the Pismire. 1. WHereas the Grashopper chirps all Summer, the Pismire is busie about her harvest; she hurrieth corns inter her hole, laying them up against winter. 2. When the winter grew sharp, the hunger starv'd Grashopper came to the Pismire and begged meat. 3. The Pismire refused to give her any, and told her, That she herself had taken pains whilst she sung. 4. Mor. He that is slothfull in youth shall want in old age; and he that doth not spare, shall beg in time to come. 119. Of the Ape and her two Cubs. 1. WHen as an Ape, as they say, hath brought forth two cubs, she lo∣veth the one, and careth not for the other. 2. She had two at a litter, and when a fright came upon her, she, to avoid the danger, caught that which she loved, in her arms, which (as she ran away in haste) she dashed against a great stone, and killed. 3. But that which was not regarded, which stuck close on her rough back as she ran away, remained safe. 4. Mor. It often comes to pass, that parents are an occasion of mis∣chief and danger to that son, whom they tenderly affect, through their too much indulgency: whilst he, whom they less affect, behaves himself gal∣lantly and honestly. 120. Of the Ox and the Steer. 1. AN Ox being now grown ancient, drew the plow every day. 2. A Steer, that had never known labour, skippeth in the Neighbouring pastures, and at last insulteth over the fortune of his elder. 3. He vaunteth, That he never knew yoke or bands, that he was free and at ease: whereas the Ox had his neck worn bare with labour. 4. And again, That he was stick and in good case: whereas the Ox was rugged and lean.
5. His elder at that time indeed said nothing to the contrary; but short∣ly after he saw this skipper to be drawn to the Altars, and then he speaks to him in these words. 6. What is thy easie life come to? 7. That secure ease hath brought thee to the ax. 8. Now at the least way, as I suppose, thou dost rather persuade me to labour, which preserves me, than to ease, which hath now haled thee to the slaughter. 9. Mor. To order our life well, we had need of labour and watcbfulness. 10. But a slothfull person, and one that is given to pleasure, shall have that end of his things, which he would be loth to have. 121. Of the Dog and the Lyon. 1. THE dog meets a Lyon, and jeers him, saying, Why dost thou, poor wretch, being starved with hunger, run up and down the woods, and by-places? 2. Look upon me, that am fat, and well liking; and I get not these by labour but by ease. 3. Then the Lyon made answer, Thou indeed hast thy good fare; but thou fool, thou hast hands withall. 4. Be thou a slave, thou canst do like a slave; I indeed am free, and will not serve. 5. Mor. The Lyon answered gallantly; for Liberty is better than a∣ny thing whatsoever. 122. Of the Fishes, 1. A Fresh-water fish was carried into the Sea by the force of the stream: where it bragging of its nobility, set light by all the Sea kind of fish. 2. The Seal could not endure this, but said, its Nobility should then be shewed, if it being caught with the Seal, should be carried with him to the market. 3. That he himself should be bought up by the Nobles, but is by the ordinary sort of people. 4. Mor. Many are so taken with a desire of glory, that they them∣selves vaunt and brag of themselves. 5. But the commendation of his own mouth, is not accounted a com∣mendation for a man, but it is entertained with the laughter of them that hear it. 123. Of the Libard and the Fox. 1. A Libard, that hath a speckled back, began to look big upon it; the other wild beasts, and the very Lyons being scorned by him. 2. A Fox comes to him, and persuades him not to be proud, saying, That he indeed had a gay skin, but himself had a gallant wit. 3. Mor. There is a difference and an order of good things. 4. The Goods of the body, excel the Goods of fortune; and it behoveth, that the Goods of the mind he preferred before them both. 124. Of the Fox and the she-Libard. 1. WHen the she-Libard once set light by a Fox, in comparison of her self, because she had a skin speckled with all kind of colou∣red spots; the Fox made answer, That she her self had that comeliness in her mind, which she had in her skin. 2. Mor. And indeed it is much better to have a nimble wit, than a speckled skin.
125. Of the Fox and the Cat. 1. WHen once the Fox, in a discourse that she had with the Cat, brag∣ged, that he had several shifts, so that he had een a budget full of tricks; the Cat answered, That she had but one shift only to rely upon, if any danger should be. 2. As they were talking, on a sudden, a cry was heard, of dogs co∣ming towards them. 3. Then the Cat leap'd into a very high tree, whereas the Fox in the interim being surrounded with a kennel of Hounds, was catch't. 4. Mor. The fable implies, that one device is better sometimes, so that it be true and effectual, than many tricks and vain devices. 126. Of the King and the Apes. 1. A King of Aegypt taught some Apes, that they might perfectly learn how to dance. 2. For, as no living creature doth more resemble the shape of a man, so none else doth better, or more willingly, imitate mens actions. 3. Therefore after they were very well taught the art of dancing, they began to dance, being clad in purple roes, and disguised: and the show took very well a long time, till a conceited merry man, a∣mong the spectators, threw nuts amongst them which he carried privately in his pocket. 4. Then presently the Apes, as soon as they had seen the nuts, having for∣gotten the dance, began to be that which they were before: and ox a sudden from dancers▪ they returned to Apes: and having torn their visards and rent their Clothes, they scrambled one with another for the nuts, to the exceeding great laughter of the beholders. 5. Mor. This fable advertiseth us, that the ornaments of fortune, do not alter a neans disposition. 127. Of the Ass and the Travellers. 1. WHen two men by chance had found an Ass in the desart, they began to fall out betwixt themselves whether of them should lead him home as their own. 2. For he seemed to be offered by fortune to both alike. 3. In the mean time, whilst they wrangled about this matter one with another, the Ass got away, and neither of them enjoyed him. 4. Mor. Some men fall short of present advantage, which through their ignorance they know not how to make use of. 128. Of the Fishermen. 1. SOme fishermen having cast in their nets, haled out Tortoises. 2. When they had shared them amongst themselves, and were not able to eat them up all, they invited Mercury, as he chanced to come to them, to their chear. 3. But he, perceiving that he was not at all invited out of any good will, but that he might ease them from over glutting themselves with the meat, , and had them eat the Tortoises themselves, which they had aught.
4. Mor. Some men after they have unadvisedly undertaken any thing, implore other mens ad, whom they may engage in their own business. 129. Of the Ass. 1. AT Cumanum, an Ass, that was weary of his slavery, having bro∣ken the bridle, had run away into a forest: He fitted a Lyons skin, which by chance he had found there, to his body, and so behaved himself instead of a Lyon; frighting both men and wild beasts with his voice and tail. 2. For the Cumani do not know a Lyon. 3. This disguised Ass therefore, bare sway a great while after this manner, being taken and feared for an huge Lyon; till a stranger go∣ing to Cumae, (one who had oftentimes seen both a Lyon and an Ass, and therefore it was no hard matter for him to know him) found that it was an Ass by his loaf ears, and by some other signs, and brought him home, being soundly cudgeled; and restored him to his master, that owned him. 4. Now in the mean time, the Ass being already owned, made all the people of Cumanum laugh exceedingly, whom ere while▪ he being thought to be a Lyon, had almost frighted to death. 5. Mor. We cannot well hide those vices which have grown up with us, ever since we were children. 130. Of the Beetle and the Eagle. 1. A Beetle on a time, being slighted by an Eagle, began to think of taking revenge one way or other. 2. He searched diligently where the Eagle had built her nest; the Beetle crept to it, and threw down her eggs, with the like wile. 3. When the Eagle had of en changed her dwelling, and did no good, she went to Jupiter her Patron, and told him her misery. 4. He bids her lay her, eggs in his lap, which were like to be safe even in that place. 5. But the peevish Beetle crept hither also, by the welts and plaits of his cloaths, whilst Jupiter never felt it at all. 6. Afterwards, when Jupiter saw the eggs to be stirred, and did not well mind, being affrighted at the strangeness of the matter, he shaked his lap, and threw them on the ground. 7. Mor. This fable teacheth us, That no man, though he be never so little, is to be undervalued. 131. Of the Satyr and the Country-man. 1. A Satyr, when he was very cold, in an extraordinary great frost, was brought into his house and entertained by a Country-man. 2. And wondring why the man blew into his hands, which he held to his mouth, he asked him why he did so? 3. He made answer, That he might warm his cold hands, with the warmth of his breath. 4. After wards when, after a fire was made, and the Table furnish∣ed, he blew again into his hot pottage; He wondring also the more at him, enquired of him what this might mean.
5. That I might cool my pottage, quoth he, which is too hot, with my breath. 6. Then the Satyr rising from the table saith, What do I hear? 7. Dost thou blow both hot and cold too, out of the same mouth? 8. You shall pack. 9. For, I do not like to live in the same house with such a man. 10. Mor. Double tongued men are here set out, who sometimes com∣mend, and sometimes discommend the same man. 132. Of the Lark and her young ones. 1. AESop, that Fabulist of Phrygia, was, for good reason, thought to be a wise man, because he did not severely and imperiously command and censure what were good to be advised and persuaded unto, as the Phi∣losophers are wont to do, but, having feigned merry & delightfull tales, he brought into mens understandings & minds, things that were wholesom∣ly and heedfully taken notice of, with a winning way of hearing. 2. At this little fable of his, concerning a little bird's little nest, doth prettily and pleasantly premonish, that the hope & confidence of business, which one may dispatch, is never to be put in another, but in ones self. 3. There is a little bird, quoth he, her name is a Lark, she lives and builds her nest in the standing corn, about the time almost that harvest is ready, her young ones being just then ready to flie. 4. That Lark as it fell out, was gone into a crop of corn, that was soo∣ner ripe than ordinary; and therefore when the corn began to grow white, her young ones were not fledged. 5. Therefore when she went to seek meat for her young, she warned them, that they should take notice, if any new thing were there said or done, and that they should tell it her, when she came back again. 6. Afterwards the owner of that corn calls his son being a young man, and saith, Dost thou not see that these are ripe, and require hands now? 7. Therefore to morrow, as soon as it shall be light see thou go to our friends, and intreat them that they would come and lend us their pains, and help us in with this harvest. 8. When he had said these words, he went his way: and when the Lark came again her young ones quivering, made a noise about her, and intreated their dam that she would now make haste quickly and remove her self in∣to another place. 9. For the owner,  they, hath sent his son to intreat his friends, that they would come by peep of day, and shear. 10. The dam bids them, not to fear any thing. 11. For if the owner, quoth she, hath put off his harvest to his friends, the corn will not be shorn to morrow; nor is there any great need, that I should take you away to day. 12. On the day after therefore, the dam flies abroad to get meat; th Master tarries for them that he had intreated; the Sun groweth hot and nothing is done, and there were no friends. 13. Then saith he again to his son, Those friends are for the most par of them idle persons: but let us two go rather, and intreat our Cousins & kinsfolks, and neighbours, that they may come to morrow in time to shea▪ 14. The young ones being affrighted told this in like manner to their dam▪
15. The dam exhorts them that then also they would not fear, nor take any care; she saith, That no Cousins, or Kinsfolks almost, were so bane, as to make no delay to take a toyl upon them, and to do as they are bidden presently: Onely mind you, quoth she, if so be any thing be said again any further. 16. Another morning betimes, the bird went to feed, the cousins and kinsfolks forbear the pains, which they were intreated to afford. 17. At the last therefore the Master said to his Son, Let our friends & our kindred farewell, thou shalt bring two sickles, as soon as ever it is day, I my self will take one to me, and thou shalt take the other to thee, and we our selves will shear the corn to morrow with our own hands. 18. When the dam heard of her young ones, that the Master said that; she said, It is time to give place, and to be gone. 19. It will now without question be done, what he hath said shall be. 20. For now it resteth in him, whom the matter concerneth, not in another, of whom help is desired. 21. And so the Lark removed from her nest, and the corn was shorn by the owner of it. 22. Mor. This indeed is a Fable of Aesop's, touching the relying upon friends and near acquaintance which is for the most part light and vain. 23. But what else do the purer books of the Philosophers advise us, than that we should trust to our selves only; & that we should esteem all other things, which are without us, and without our mind, neither for ours, nor for us. 24. Ennius in his Satyrs, hath very wittily & handsomely comprised this tale of Aesop's, in well compacted verses: the two last whereof are these, which Iverily think it is worth the labour, to have in ones heart & memory. 25. Be sure this thing be always in thy thought; What thou canst do, trust not thy friends for ought. 133. Of the Birds and the Owl. 1. ALmost all the birds once went to the Owl, and intreated her, that hereafter she would not build in the false roofs of houses, but rather in the boughs of a tree, and amongst the green branches, for there she might more sweetly take the pleasure of the spring. 2. Moreover, they shewed her a little Oak, that was newly sprung up, and somewhat tender as yet; in which forsooth the Owl, as they said, might sometimes sit softly, and make her nest for her self. 3. But she said, she would not do it. 4. But, on the other side, she gave them counsel, that they should not trust themselves to that little tree. 5. For it would one time or other bring forth bird-lime, to wit, the very bane of birds. 6. They, as they are a light and flickering kind, scorned the counsel of a wise Owl. 7. Now the Oak was grown up, now it was spread, now it was full of green leaves. 8. Behold, there all the birds flutter by flocks in the boughs, they are merry, they hop up and down, they play together, and they chirp. 9. In the mean time, that Oak had brought forth bird-lime, and men had observed it; thereupon, all the poor birds alike, were entangled there on a sudden; and when it was too late, they repented themselves in vain, because they had scorned that whole some advice.
10. And they say, this is the reason, why all the birds now, when they see the Owl, thronging about her do as it were compliment her, bring her along, follow her, sit about her, and flie about her. 11. For, remembring her advice, they now admire her as one that is wise, and stand round about her in a throng, that forsooth, they may once learn of her to be wise. 12. But I think to no purpose, nay indeed, also sometimes to their great harm. 13. For those ancient Owls were wise in good earnest; and now there are many Owls, which indeed have the feathers, and the eyes, and the beak of Owls, but they have not the wisdom. 14. Mor. This fable teacheth you, that you do not scorn the Counsel of him, that giveth you good advice. 134. Of the Gourd and the Pine-tree. 1. A Gourd was once sown near a Pine-tree, which was a very great one, and had broad boughs. 2. Now the Gourd, when it was grown big with many showers, and sea∣sonableness of the weather, began to be wanton, and to reach out its boughs somewhat saucily. 3. Now it crept into the Pine, now it advanced to get up, now it adven∣tured to wrap about the boughs and green branches, making shew of its greater leaves, its white flowers, and of its huge and fresh green fruits. 4. Therefore it grew so proud and insolent that it adventured to chal∣lenge the Pine-tree, and saith, Thou seest how I out-go thee, how I excell in large leaves, how I excell in greenness, and straightway over-top thee. 5. Then the Pine, which was gravely wise and strong, did not at all wonder at the boldness of the saucy Gourd, but answered it thus. 6. I have here abode many winters, heats, sun burnings, and sundry calamities, and do yet remain sound. 7. Thou wilt have less presumption at the first frost nips, when both thy leaves shall fall down, and all thy greenness shall be gone. 8. Mor. We must not be proud in prosperity. 135. Of the Crow and the Wolves. 1. A Crow bears the Wolves company along steep tops of the high moun∣tains: she desires that she might have a part of the prey, because having followed them she had at no time left them, and she had been a companion. 2. Afterwards she was shaken off by the Wolves, as having not followed them, but the prey and the meat; and was no less like to devour the in∣wards of the Wolves, if they should be killed, than she did of other li∣ving creatures. 3. Mor. We must not always look upon what we do, but how we stand affected when we do it. 136. Of the Earth's labour. 1. THE earth on a time being grown big▪ and wonderfully swoln, made shew, as if she would bring forth some great thing. 2. They that dwell near, run to her, the husbandmen stand amazed; they between hope and fear expect the earth's delivery. 3. Some thought, that that Typhoeus, with an hundred hands; others thought, that mountains were like to burst forth.
4. The earth is opened, there came forth a Mouse; and they turned that into a laughter and a jest, which was thought would be a wonder to all. 5. Mor. We must not always believe gay promises. 137. Of the Members and the Belly. 1. MAns joynts, when they saw the belly idle, fell out with it, and denied it their help. 2. When they also by th means fainted, they understood, that the belly divided the meat, which it had received throughout all the mem∣bers; and they became friends with it again. 3. Mor. Great matters decay by discord, they avail by concord. 138. Of Arion and the Dolphin. 1. ARion was an ancient and famous Fidler. 2. He was of the place and town Methymna, and of th Coun∣try and Isle Lesbos. 3. Periander the King of Corinth esteemed that Arion as a friend, and loved him for his skill. 4. He travels thence from the King, to see the famous Countries Si∣cily and Italy. 5. When he came thither, he pleased both the ears and the minds of all, in the Cities of both the Lands; and there the men prized him, took pleasure in him, and loved him. 6. He then afterwards, having gotten good store of money, and a good estate, resolved to return to Corinth. 7. He therefore chose a ship and mariners, that were Corinthians, as being better known, and more friends to him. But the Corinthians, after they had entertained that man, and the ship was carried into the deep, be∣ing greedy of the booty and the money, took counsel about killing Arion. 8. Then he, when he understood the villany, ave them his money, and his other things that they might have it; and intreated them that they would but spare his life. 9. The Mariners were so far moved with these prayers of his, that they forbare to kill him by force with their own hands; but commanded him to leap headlong presently into the sea before their faces. 10. The man being daunted at that, and all hope of life being lost, af∣terwards intreated this one thing, that before he died, they would give him leave to put on his clothes, and to take his fiddle, and to sing a song of that his hap which might be able to comfort him. 11. Then the wild and savage Seamen had a great desire to hear him. 12. He obtains what he had intreated. 13. And there presently, being girt after his manner, cloathed, made fine, and standing upon the hatches of the top of the stem, he sung the ong which vs called Orthyum, with a very loud voice. 14. Towards the end of his song, he threw himself a good way into the deep, with his fiddle, and all his dressing, as he stood, and sung. 15. The Mariners, not making any other question, but that he had pe∣rished, held on in the course which they had begun to make. 16. But a strange, and wonderfull, and loving act befell, a Dolphin on a sudden swam to him amongst the waves, and holding up his back above the wves, took him up, and carried him with his body and clothes safe to Taenarus, in the country of Laconia.
17. Then Arion went quite from that place to Corinth, and offered him∣self to King Periander, as he had been carried by the Dolphin, and told him the thing as it had happened. 18. The King did not believe it, but gave order, that Arion should be kept in prison, as if he deceived him: and in a dissembling manner asked the Seamen, being sought for, whilst Arion was kept close, whether they had heard any thing concerning Arion, in those places from whence they came. 19. They said the man was in Italy when they went thence, and did very well there, and that the Cities did much affect him, and delight in him, and that he was happy in their favour, and store of money. 20. Then whilst they speak these words, Arion slipt forth with his harp and cloaths, with which he had cast himself into the Sea. 21. The Mariners being astonished and convicted, could not deny. 22. Mor. This fable teacheth us that more pity is sometimes found in the brute creatures, than in those men, that, besides wealth, have no worth; besides shape, nothing of a man. 139. Of the Spider and the Gout. 1. THE Spider being somewhat more at leisure from weaving; wal∣ked seasonably abroad to refresh her self. 2. The Gout offereth to meet her though she could very hardly overtake her by uneven strides. 3. After that days journey was pretty well passed, they were not far from a little town, which the Inhabitants of that Country called Tyche. 4. They took both a resolution, to seek out an host agreeable to their condition. 5. The Spider, without making much ado, goes to lodge in a rich man's house, there she hangs out her webs on every side, and spreads out her nets. 6. Presently there came, I know not what ugly faces, which pulled down her weavers shop. 7. Therefore her buildings were but for a little while, which way soever she turned her self. 8. For she could no where avoid the Grooms beesoms, that could espy a thing quickly. 9. She was in a very sad condition, which alone was vexed and troubled, amidst such plenty of all things. 10. But the Gout, like a poor beggar had at last with much ado, got leave to come into a poor mans cottage: when she had sat down in that place she endured all kind of miseries. 11. Coarse bread was set before her, when she had a mind to her supper, & a pot of water, when she could scarce gape, because her chaps were so drie. 12. A boarded bed was spread, not with green leaves, not with grass, but with small chaff for her that was weary with travel on the day time. 13. And it is not my purpose now to tell, how hardly such hard bed∣ding, such coarse ruggs agreed with her soft members, with a skin (as I may say of silk. 14. That stately Star therefore, which hears and sees all things, was scarce risen, when the Spider and the Gout met again together. 15. The Spider first tells the troubles of the night past, the changing of so many places, sometimes blaming the Master's neatness, and sometimes the overmuch observance of the Groom.
16. The Gout, on the contrary, frameth many stories, concerning the poverty of her Host, nor hath she leasure to shew the Spider the blew marks, which the hard bed-stead had made in her tender skin. 17. They make a motion that the Spider ought thenceforward to en∣ter into poor mens cottages, and the Gout into rich mens halls; they both willingly condescend to this opinion. 18. But yet, as it grew darker and darker, they drew near to a City. 19. The Gout not forgetting what was decreed upon, stole softly in∣to the house of a certain monied man. 20. Who being, as good hap was, espied by the Master, O strange, with what kind respect, with what courtesie and with what comple∣ments was she entertained! 21. Swan-down beds, and bolsters stuft with the underwing down of Partridges, were put and spread under her. 22. I forbear to speak of the Hypocras, the Alicant, the wine of Les∣bos, and of Tarentum. 23. I forbear to speak of the Snap-figs, the Pheasants, and these small birds, which pride it with two colours. 24. In short, there was no delight, no pleasure, which she enjoyed not. 25. The Spider having entred into the poor mans cottage, weaves her webs; which way soever the wall lieth with open di∣stances she hangs her nets. 26. She bestirs her self busily about her round fashioned work; she mends what was broken, she finishes what was begun: and, that I may speak briefly, she bears all the sway in the empty house. 27. She fears no ambuscadoes, she fears no open on sets; nay indeed she is out of the reach of besoms. 28. Not long after, the Gout meets the Spider, she set out at large her delights, her happiness, her fortunes. 29. The Spider extolls her Empire, and her liberty to weave, with wonderfull commendations. 30. This resolution at the last liked them both, that what way soever they travelled, the Gout should turn into rich mens ouses, and the Spider into poor mens Cottages. 31. Mor. Though this Apologue may be applied to several uses, yet it declareth this especially, that one is in one place more fortunate than in another. 32. Besides, that great mens houses are the receptacles of diseases. 33. Lastly, that there is no where greater liberty, than where there is less wealth. 140. Of the Mouse that was bred in a Chest. 1. A Mouse that was bred in a Chest, had spent almost all her life there, being fed with nuts, which used to be kept in it. 2. As she was playing about the sides of the Chest, and had fallen down, and sought how to get up again she found good chear very dain∣tily provided. 3. Which when she had begun to taste she said, How foolish have I been hitherto, who thought nothing in the world to be better thn my Chest, look what sweeter meats I eat here! 4. Mor. This fable sheweth, that we must not be so in love with our country if it be mean, as not to g to other places, seeing we may be more happy elsewhere.
141. Of the Country-man that had obtained, that Wheat might grow without Beards. 1. A Country-man had obtained of Ceres, that Wheat should grow with∣out beards, lest it should hurt the hands of them that did shear or hresh it: which, as soon as it ripened was eaten up by the little birds. 2. Then said the Country-man, how deservedly do I suffer, who have lost very great profits, for a little conveniency sake. 3. Mor. This fable signifieth, that small inconveniences are to be weigh∣ed with a greater profit. 142. Of the Hawk, that pursued the Pigeon. 1. WHen a Hawk pursued a Pigeon with a speedy flight, he went into a Farm-house, and the Country-man caught him. 2. Whom he intreated in a fair manner, that he would let him go: for, said he, I have done thee no hurt. 3. To whom the Country-man made answer, neither had the Pigeon hurt thee. 4. Mor. This fable sheweth, that they are deservedly punished, who strive to hurt the innocent. 143. Of the Spider and the Swallow. 1. A Spider being vext against a Swallow, because she catch'd flies, which are her meat, had hang'd her nets in a door stead, through which she used to flie, that she might catch her. 2. But the Swallow, as she flew, carried the nets, with her that wove them through the air. 3. Then the Spider hanging in the air, and perceiving that she was like to perish presently said: 4. How justly do I suffer these things, which having much ado to catch the least things that flie, with great toil, did think that I could hold such great birds! 5. Mor. We are advised by this fable, not to undertake things be∣yond our strength. 144. Of a Country-man that was to pass over a River. 1. A Country-man being to pass over a River, which by chance had grown big with showers, sought for a ford. 2. And when he had first tried that part of the River, which seemed more quiet and still, he found it deeper, than he had thought in his mind. 3. Again where he found it more shallow and safe there the streams ran with a greater noise of waters. 4. Then he said to himself, how more safely may we commit our life to waters that make a great noise, than to them that are still and quiet. 5. Mor. We are admonished by this fable, that we should less fear men that are full of words, and use to threaten, than still men.
145. Of the Pigeon and the Magpy. 1. A Pigeon being asked by a Magpy, what persuaded her to build always in the same place, seeing her young ones were always taken thence from her? 2. Answered, Simplicity. 3. Mor. This fable sheweth▪ that honest men are oftentimes easi∣ly deceived. 146. Of the Cuckow and the Hawk. 1. THE Cuckow was jeered by the Hawk that, whereas she was as big bodied as she, and not unlike in colour to her (for narrow∣ness of spirit) she would rather eat earth-worms, than the sweet flesh of other birds. 2. Within a few days after, she saw the Hawk being caught by a Country-man, whose pigeons she pursued, to hang down from an high turret, for the terrour of others. 3. To whom the Cuckow said, Friend, how much better had it been for you to hunt worms, than to make after other folks birds? 4. Mor. This fable sheweth, that their life is safer, and more to be liked of, that are content with their own things without danger, than theirs who coveting other mens things, undergo great perils of life. 147. Of the Ass and the Calf. 1. THE Ass and the Calf feeding in the same pasture, had perceived by the sound of a Bell that the Enemies army came towards them. 2. Then the Calf said, O companion, let us run away hence, lest the enemies carry us away prisoners. 3. To whom the Ass said, Do thou run away, whom the enemies have used to kill and eat. 4. It maketh no matter to the Ass, to whom the same article of car∣rying a burden is every where offered. 5. Mor. This fable admonisheth servants that they do not much fear to change their Masters, if so be that they are not like to be worse than their former. 148. Of the Fox and the Women that eat the Hens. 1. A Fox passing by a farm-house, espied a company of women, very silently eating a great many hens, very daintily roasted. 2. Towards whom she turning her self said, What outcries and barking of dogs would there be against me, if I should do that which you do? 3. To whom an old woman answering said, Thou base creature, we those things that are our own, but thou stealest other mens things. 4. Mor. This fable adviseth us, that we do not think, we may do that with other mens things, which the owners may do.
149. Of the fat Capons and the lean one. 1. A Man had largely crammed many Capons, which were shut up in the same coop, who were made fat all saving one, whom his fellows mocked as a lean rascal. 2. The Master being to entertain some noble guests, at a dainty and costly feast, commands the cook, that he should kill and dress some of those, which he should find fatter than others. 3. The fat ones hearing this troubled themselves, saying, How much better had it been for us, to be lean. 4. Mor. This fable was invented for poor mens comfort, whose life is safer than rich mens. 150. Of the piece of Timber, and the Oxen that drew it. 1. A Piece of Elm-Timber complained to the Oxen, saying, O ye ingratefull Oxen, I have fed you a long time with my green boughs; but you drag me that have nourished you, along the stones and the mire. 2. To whom the Oxen made answer, Our groans, and our sighs, and the goad wherewith we are pricked, can teach thee, that we draw thee full sore against our wills. 3. Then the piece of timber pardoned them. 4. Mor. This fable teacheth us, that we be not angry against them, that hurt us against their wills. 151. Of the goodly Trees, and the ill-favoured one. 1. A Great many trees grew together in the same place, being tall, streight and free from knots▪ except one that was low, little and knotty, which the other used to make a mocking stock on, as being ill favoured and dwarfish. 2. The Owner of them being about to build an house in a place, gave order, that they should all be fell'd except that which seemed likely to make the house unhandsome, by its shortness and ill favouredness. 3. When the rest were cut down, the ill favoured one said thus with it self; Nature, I will no more complain of thee, because thou hast bred me ill favoured, seeing I see such great dangers to hang over the heads of them that are fair. 4. Mor. This fable doth admonish us, that we be not sorry, that we are born unhandsome, seeing handsomness hath oftentimes done many hurt. 152. Of the Swan that sung at her death, and was blamed by the Stork. 1. THE Swan being ready to die, was asked by the Stork, why she sung far more sweetly at her death, (which other living creatures so much dread) than she had done in all her life, seeing she ought rather to be sad? 2. To whom the Swan said, Because I shall never be vexed any more with the care of seeking meat, nor shall I fear the snares of Fowlers. 3. Mor. This fable admonisheth us, that we do not fear death, by which, all the miseries of this present life are cut off.
153. Of the Woman that wailed for her dying Husband, and of her Mother that comforted her. 1. A Mother comforted a woman, that was yet but young, whose Hus∣band lay a dying, saying, Daughter, do not afflict thy self, do not take on so very much; for I have found thee another husband, a great deal handsomer than this, who will quickly ease thee of thy want of thy former husband. 2. But the woman, not able to refrain her sorrow, (as one that did ardently affect her husband) did not onely turn the deaf ear towards her mother's words; but blamed the unseasonable mention of another husband. 3. But as soon as she saw her husband dead, amidst her tears and mour∣ning she asked her mother, whether the young Man was there, whom she would give her for a husband. 4. Mor. This tale sheweth, how quickly women use to forget their love to their deceased husbands. 154. Of a Woman that wept for her Lovers departure. 1. A Dishonest woman wept sore for her sweet-heart, when he went away, whom she had pillaged of almost all his things. 2. And when a neighbour asked her, why she wept so, and would not be comforted; she said, I do not weep for his departure, but for the Cloak which I have left him. 3. Mor. This fable sheweth, that not the lovers, but their goods are beloved by whores. 155. Of the Flie, which sitting upon a Chariot, said she had raised a dust. 1. CHariots, upon which there sat a flie, ran in a race. 2. And when there was a very great dust risen, both by the trampling of the horses feet, and the rowling of the wheels, the flie said, What a mighty dust have I raised? 3. Mor. This fable belongs to them, who, although they be cowar∣dous, endeavour to take other mens glory to themselves, by their brag-words. 156. Of the Eel that complained that she was infested more than the Serpent. 1. AN Eel asked a Serpent, Why seeing they were alike, and a kin, men should rather pursue her than him. 2. To whom the Serpent said, because men seldom hurt me, without danger. 3. Mor. This fable sheweth, that they use less to be hurt, who re∣venge themselves.
157. Of the Ass, the Ape, and the Mole. 1. WHen the Ass complained, that he wanted horns, and the Ape that she wanted a tail; the Mole said, hold you your tongues, forasmuch as ye may see me blind. 2. Mor. This fable belongs to them who are not content with their con∣dition; who, if they did but consider other mens misfortunes, would more patiently endure their own. 158. Of the Sea-men that implored the help of Saints. 1. A Sea-man that was overtaken with a sudden and black storm in the Sea, said to the rest of his fellows, that implored the help of of divers Saints, Ye know not what ye ask. 2. For, before that those Saints can go to God for our deliverance, we shall be overborn with this storm, that hangs over our heads. 3. I think therefore we had best flie to him, who will be able to deliver us from so great evils, without the help of another. 4. When therefore they had called upon God Almighty's help, the storm presently ceased. 5. Mor. This fable sheweth, where the help of one that is more able can be had, we must not flie to them that are weaker. 159. Of the Fish, that leaped out of the Frying-pan into the hot Coals. 1. THE Fish being yet alive, were fried in a frying-pan, with scal∣ding hot oyl; whereof one said, Brethren, let us go away hence, left we perish. 2. Then they, leaping all at once out of the frying-pan, fell upon the burning hot coals. 3. When therefore they felt the more smart, they condemned the coun∣sel which they had taken, saying, By how much a more cruel death do we now die? 4. Mor. This fable teacheth us, so to avoid present dangers, that we fall not into greater. 160. Of the four-footed Beasts that made a League with the Fish against the Birds. 1. THE four-footed beasts, when war was proclaimed against them by the birds, made a league with the fish, that by their help they might defend themselves from the fury of the Birds. 2. But when they expected their desired succours, the fish said, They could not come to them by land. 3. Mor. This fable adviseth us, that we should not make them our allies, who, when need is, cannot come at us.
161. Of the covetous Ambassadour, that beguiled the Trumpeters. 1. A Certain covetous person being sent Ambassadour for his Country, came into another City, upon whom the Trumpeters readily wai∣ted, that they might fill his ears with the sound of their Trumpets, and their own pockets with his money. 2. To whom be sent word, That it was now no time for musick: that he was in great mourning and sorrow, because his Mother was dead. 3. The Trumpeters then being frustrated of their expectation, went away sorrowfull. 4. A friend of the Ambassadours hearing of his mourning, comes to him to visit him, and to comfort him, and asks him, how long his mo∣ther had been dead? 5. It is now forty years ago, quoth he. 6. Then his friend when he understood the Ambassadours witty put off, laughed heartily. 7. Mor. This fable belongs to covetous men, who strive with all their skill to save their money. 162. Of a man that came to a Cardinal that was newly created, to bid him joy. 1. A Notable merry conceited and jesting fellow, hearing that his friend was preferred to the dignity of a Cardinalship, came to him to bid him joy. 2. Who being puft up with honour, and loth to own his old friend, asked him, who he was? 3. To whom he, as he was ever ready to bring out his jests, said, I am sorry for you, and others that come to such honours as this. 4.

14. Vesperì enim ciconia cubitum eunte, ex antris egressae rauc uatu murmurant: sed surdo canunt. 15. Vult enim Jupiter, ut quae regem clementem sint depreca∣, jam ferant inclementem. 16. Mor. l'erinde atque Ranis, evenire solet plebi; quae si Regem mansuetiorem habet, ignavum & inertem esse causatur: op∣tat aliquando contingere sibi virum. 17.

Non sunt cuncta credenda cunctis. 5. Multi suam operam pollicentur, non tuî amore, sed suî▪ suum
21. De partu Montium. 1. OLim rumor erat parturire Montes. 2. Homines accurrunt, circumsistunt, monstri quippiam non sine pavore expectantes. 3. Parturiunt tandem Montes, exit mus. 4. Tum omnis risu emori. 5. Mor. Hanc fabellam tangit Horatius. Parturiunt Montes, nascetur ridiculus Mus. 6. Notat etiam jactantiam. 7. Jactabundi enim, cum magna profitentur & ostentant, vix arva faciunt. 8. Quapropter Thrasones illi, jure sunt materia joci & scomma∣um. 9. Vetat item haec Fabula inanes timores. 10. Plerum{que} enim gravior periculo est periculi metus; imò, ridi∣lum est quod metuimus. 22. De cane venatico qui ab Hero contemnitur. 1. CAnem venaticum, qui jam senuerat, instigat herus; frustra hortatur, tardi sunt pedes, non properat. 2. Praehenderat feram; Fera edentulo elabitur. 3. Increpat herus verbere & verbo. 4. Canis respondet, debere sibi jure ignosci; jam senuisse, at venem fuisse strenuum. 5. Sed ut video, inquit, nil placet sine fructu, juvenem amâsti edabundum; odisti tardum, edentulum. 6. Sed, si gratus esses, quem olim juvenem frugis cauâ dilexisti, em fructuosae juventutis gratiâ diligeres. 7. Mor. Recte Canis. 8. Nam teste Nasone, Nil, nisi quod prodest, charum est; n, detrahe menti Spem fructûs avidam, nemo petrendus erit. 9. Praeteriti commodi nulla est memoria, futuri autem gratia non gna, praesentis commodi summa. Turpe quidem dictu, sed si modò vera fatemur, Vulgus amicitias utilitate probat. 23. De Leporibus & Ranis. Ylvâ insolito mugiente turbine, trepidi Lepores rapidè occipiunt fugere. Fugientibus cum obsisteret palus, stetere anxii, utrinque com∣ensi periculis. Quodque majoris esset incitamentum timoris, vident in palu∣ergi Ranas. Tunc ex Leporibus unus prudentior caeteris ac disertior, Quid, , inaniter timemus?
5. Animo opus est. 6. Corporum quidem agilitas nobis est, sed animus deest. 7. Hoc periculum turbinis non fugiendum, sed est contemnendum. 8. Mor. Omni in re opus animo. 9. Jacet virtus sine confidentiâ. 10. Confidentia enim dux & regina virtutis est. 24. De Hoedo & Lupo. CApra cùm esset pastum itura, Hoedum domi concludit, monens aperire nemini, dum redeat ipsa. 2. Lupus, qui id procul audierat, post matris discessum pulsa res: voce Cuprissat, jubens recludi. 3. Hoedus dolum praesentiens, Non aperio, inquit; nam etsi x caprissat, tamen equidem per rimulas Lupum video. 4. Mor. Obedire parenti filios, ipsis est utile; & Juvenem seni cet auscultare. 25. De Cervo & Ove. CErvus coram Lupò Ovem eam facit, modium tritici debere clamitans. 2. Ovis debiti quidem erat inscia, tamen Ob Lupi praesentiam ndet se daturam. 3. Dicitur solutioni dies: adest: monet Cervus Ovem. Illa it inficias. Quod enim promiserat, excusat factum id metu & praesenti pi. Votum extortum non esse servandum. Mor. Sententia juris est, Vim vi repellere licet. Ex hâc Fabellâ nova quaedam nascitur, Fraudem fraude, re∣re licet. 36. De Rustico & Angue. RUsticus quidam nutrierat anguem. Iratus aliquando bestiam petit securi. Evadit ille, non sine vulnere. Postea rusticus deveniens ad paupertatem, ratus est id infor∣i propter anguis Injuriam sibi accidere. Igitur supplicat angui, ut redeat. Ille ait, Ignoscere se, sed redire nolle; neque fore securum rustico, cui tanta fit domi securis; livorem vulneris desiisse, esse tamen memoriam. Mor. Ei, qui semel fidem solvit, iterum habere fidem vix est . Injuriam quidem condonare, id sanè misericordiae est: cave∣
27. De Vulpecula & Ciconia. 1. VUlpecula vocavit Ciconiam ad coenam. 2. Opsonium in mensam effundit; quod, cum liquidum esset, ciconiâ frustrà rostro tentante. Vulpecula lingit. 3. Abit elusa avis pudetque pigetque injuriae. 4. Post plusculum dierum redit, invitat Vulpeculam. 5. Vitreum vas situm erat plenum opsonii: quod quidem vas, cùm esset arcti gutturis, Vulpeculae opsonium licuit videre, & esurire, gustare non licuit. 6. Ciconia rostro facilè exhausit. 7. Mor. Risus risum, jocus jocum, dolus dolum, fraus meretur fraudem. 28. De Lupo & Capite Picto. 1. LUpus in officina sculptoris caput humanum repertum versat, miratur, sentiens (id quod erat) nihil habere sensus. 2. O pulchruro, inquit, caput! 3. Est in te artis multum, sed sensûs nihil. 4. Mor. Externa pulchritudo si adsit interna grata est. 5. Sin alterutra carendum est, praestat externa, quam interna carens. 6. Illa enim sine hac interdum incurrit odium, ut stolidus e ò fit odiosior, quò formosior. 29. De Graculo. 1. GRaculus ornavit se plumis pavonis. 2. Deinde pulchellus sibi visus, fastidito genere suo, con∣tulit se ad pavonum genus. 3. Illi tandem, intellecta fraude, stolidam avem coloribus nudâ∣runt, & plagis affecerunt. 4. Horatius hanc Fabellam, primo Epistolarum libro, narrat de Cornicula. 5. Ait eam olim adornatam collectis, quae avibus exciderant, plumis: postea autem, cum unaquae{que} avium suam pluman decerpsisset, ridiculam fuisse. 6. Ne si fortè suas repetitum venerit olim Grex avium plumas, moveat cornicula risum, Furtivis nudata coloribus.— 7. Mor. Notat haec Fabula eos, qui se gerunt aequo sublimius; qui cum his vivunt, qui & ditiores sunt & magis nobiles; quare sape inopes fiunt & sunt ludibrio. 8. Probe Juvenalis monet. —è coelo descendit, . Hoc est, Nosce teipsum. 30. De Musca & Formica. 1. MUsca altercabatur cum Formica; se nobilem, illam ignobi∣lam
in cavernis latêre, segetem rodere, aquam bibere; se splen∣idè epulari jactabat; & haec tamen otio nancisci. 2. E regione, Formica se non ignobilem esse, sed suis nat alibus ontentam. Muscam Vagam esse, se stabilem; sapere Formicoe grana & fluenta, quod Muscae pastilli, & vina, atque haec se non segni tio, at strenuâ operâ nancisci: porrò formicam laetam esse & tu∣am, charam omnibus, exmplar denique laboris; Muscam anxiam um periculo esse, cunctis infestam, cunctis invisam, exemplar deni∣que segnitiei: formicam hyemis memorem alimenta reponere: muscam in diem vivere, hyeme aut esurituram, aut certe mori∣uram. 3. Mor. Qui pergit quae vult dicere, ea quae non vult audiet. 4. Musca si bene dixisset, bene audisset. 5. Assentior autem Formicae. 6. Videtur enim optabilior vita obscura a cum securitate, quam cum periculo splendida. 31. De Rana & Bove. 1. RAna cupida aequandi Bovm se distendebat. 2. Filius hortabatur matrem coepto desistere, nihil enim esse ranam ad bovem. 3. Illa secundum intumuit. 4. Clamitat natus; Crepes licèt, Mater, bovem nunquam vinces. 5. Tertiùm autem cùm intumuisset, crepuit. 6. Mor. Cuique sua dos. 7. Hic formâ, ille viribus; hic opibus, ille pollet amicis; unum∣quemque suo decet esse contentum. 8. Valet ille corpore, tu ingenio. 9. Quocirca quisque semet consulat: nec invideat superiori, quod miserum est: nec, quod stultitiae est, certare optet. 32. De Equo & Leone. 1. VEnit ad Equum commedendum Leo: carens autem prae se∣nectâ viribus, meditari coepit artem: medicum se profitetur: verborum ambage equum moratur. 2. Hic dolo dolum, artem apponit arti. 3. Fingit se nuper in loco spinoso pupugisse pedem, orat, ut inspi∣ciens sentem medicus educat. 4. Paret Leo. 5. At equus, quantâ potuit vi, calcem leoni impingit, & se con∣tinuò conjecit in pedes.
6. Leo vix tandem ad se rediens (ictu enim propè exanimatus suerat) Pretium, inquit, ob stultitiam fero: & is jure auffugit: dolum enim dolo ultus est. 7. Mor. Odio digna est simulatio, & simulatione capienda. 8. Non est timendus hostis, qui hostem prae se fent, sed qui, cùm hostis sit benevolentiam fimulat, is demum timendus est, & odio dignissimus. 33. De Equo, & Asino. 1. EQuus phaleris sellaque exornatus, cum ingenti hinnitu per viam currebat. 2. Currenti autem onustus asellus forte obstat. 3. Equus ira fremebundus, & —Frana ferox spumantia mandens. 4. Quid, inquit, tarde & ignave, obsistis equo? 5. Cede, inquam, aut proculcabo te pedibus. 6. Asellus, contrà rudere non ausus, cedit tacitus. 7. Equo autem provolanti, & cursum intendenti crepat inguen: 8. Tum cursu & ostentui inutilis, ornamentis spoliatur, deinde Carrario venditur. 9. Postea cum Carro venientem videt asellus, & affatur. 10. Heus bone vir! quid istuc ornati est? 11. Ubi aurata sella, bullata cingula? ubi nitidum fraenum? 12. Sic, amice, necesse fuit evenire superbienti. 13. Mor. Plerique in secundis rebus elati sunt, nec sui memores, nec modestiae: sed, quia prosperitate insolescunt, adversitatem incurrunt. 14. Eos qui videntur felices, monuerim esse cautos; etenim si rota fortuna circumacta fuerit, sentient miserrimum genus infortunii esse fuisse felices. 15. Accedit ad cumulum infelicitatis in quoque mali; contem∣nentur ab iis quos ipsi contempsere & illudent eis ii, quos ipsi risere. 34. De Avibus, & Quadrupedibus. 1. AVibus pugna erat cum quadrupedibus. 2. Utrinque spes, utrinque metus, utrinque erat periculum. 3. Vespertilio autem, relictis sociis, deficit ad hostes. Vincun aves, duce & auspice Aquila. 4. Transfugam verò Vespertilionem damnant, uti ne ad ave unquam illi sit reditio, uti nè lui unquam sit volatus.
5. Haec causa Vespertilioni est, ut non nisi noctu volet. 6. Mor. Qui cum sociis adversitatis & periculi particeps esse re∣nuit prosperitatis & salutis expers erit. 35. De Lupo & Vulpe. 1. LUpus, cùm praedae satis esse, in otio degebat. 2. Accedit Vulpecula, sciscitatur otii causam. 3. Sensit Lupus insidias fieri: simulat morbum esse causam: orat vulpeculam deprecatum ire deos. 4. Illa dolens dolum non succedere, adit pastorem, monet patêre latebras lupi: hostem enim securum posse inopinatò opprimi. 5. Adoritur pastor lupum, mactat. 6. Illa potitur antro, & praeda. 7. Adfuit illi breve sceleris sui gaudium: nam non ita multò post idem pastor & ipsam capit. 8. Mor. Foeda res invidia est, & ipsi interdum authori quoque perniciosa. 9. Flaccus Epistolarum, Lib. 1. Invidus alterius rebus macrescit opimis. Invidiâ Siculi non invenere tyranni Majus tormentum— 36. De Cervo. 1. CErvus in perspicuo fonte se conspicatus, Probat procera fron∣tis & ramosa cornua: sed tibiarum exilitatem damnat. 2. Fortè, dum contemplatur, dum judicat, intervenit venator: fugit cervus. Ocyor pilis, & agente nimbos, Ocyor Euro. 3. Insectantur fugientem canes. 4. Sed cùm intrasset condensam sylvam, implicita sunt ramis cornua. 5. Tum demum tibias laudabat, & cornua damnabat, quae fecêre ut praeda esset canibus. 6. Mor. Fugienda petimus: petenda fugimus. 7. Placent, quae officiunt: quae conferunt, displicent. 8. Beatitudinem cupimus, priusquam, ubi fit, intelligamus. 9. Opum excellentiam, & bonorum celsitudinem quaerimus: in∣his beatitudinem sitam opinamur, in quibus tamen multum labo ris est, & doloris. 10. Pulchrè id significat Lyricum ille noster. Saepius ventis agitatur ingens Pinus, & celsae graviore casu Decidunt turres, feriuntque summos Fulmina montes.
37. De Vipera & Lima. 1. IN Fabrica offendens limam Vipera, coepit rodere. 2. Subrisit lima, quid, inquiens, inepte? quid agis? 3. Tu tibi antè contriveris dentes, quam me atteras, quae duri∣tiem aeris praemordere soleo. 4. Mor. Etiam atque etiam vide, quicum tibi res sit. 5. Si in fortiorem dentes acuas, non illi sed tibi nocueris. 38. De Lupis & Agnis. 1. LUpis & agnis, quibus natura est discordia, foedus aliquando fuit, datis utrinque obsidibus. 2. Lupi suos catulos, oves canum cohortem dedere. 3. Quietis ovibus ac pascentibus, lupuli matrum desiderio ulu∣latus edunt. 4. Tum lupi irruentes fidem foedusque solutam clamitant, oves∣que canum praesidio destitutas laniant. 5. Mor. Inscitia est, si in foedere tua praesidia hosti tradas. 6. Nam qui hostes fuit, hostis forsan nondum esse desiit: for∣tassis & causam ceperit, cur te nudatum praesidio adoriatur. 39. De Sylva & Rustico. 1. QUo tempore etiam arboribus suus sermo erat, venit rusticus in sylvam, rogat ut ad securim suam tollere liceat capulum. 2. Annuit sylva. 3. Rusticus, aptata securi, coepit, arboris succidere. 4. Tum, & quidem sero, poenituit sylvam suae facilitatis: doluit seipsam esse causam sui exitij. 5. Mor. De quo bene merearis, vide. 6. Multi fuerunt, qui, accepto beneficio, in authoris abusi sunt perniciem. 40. De Membris & Ventre. 1. PEs & manus ventrem olim incusarunt, quod ab otioso eo lucra ipsorum vorarentur. 2. Jubent aut laboret, aut ali nè petat. 3. Supplicat ille, semel atque iterum. 4. Negant tamen manus alimentum. 5. Exhausto inediâ ventre, ubi coepere omnes artus deficere, tum manus voluit tandem osticiosa esse: verum id serò. 6. Nam venter desuetudine debilis, cibum replit.
7. Ita cuncti artus, dum ventri invident, cum ventre pereunte pe∣unt. 8. Mor. Perinde atque in membrorum societate est, ita se habet cietas humana. 9. Membrum eget membro; amicus eget amico. 10. Quare mutuis officiis, mutuis operibus utendum est; neque di∣tiae, neque dignitatem apices, hominem satis tuentur. 11. Unicum & summum praesidium, complurium amicitia est. 41. De Simia & Vulpecula. SImia vulpeculam orat, ut partem caudae sibi donet ad tegendas na∣tes, illi enim esse oneri, quod sibi foret usui & honori. 2. Respondet illa, nihil nimis esse: & se malle humum cauda sua rri, quàm simiae nates tegi. 3. Mor. Sunt qui egent, sunt quibus superest, nulli tamen divitum moris est, ut re superflua beet egenos. 42. De Cervo & Bobus. CErvus venatorem fugiens, conjecit se in stabulum: boves orat, ut in praesepi latitare liceat. 2. Boves tutum esse negant: mox enim & dominum & famulum uturos. 3. Ille fecurum se esse ait, modò nè ipsi prodant. 4. Intrat famulus, occultum foeno non videt, exit. 5. Gestire cervus, & nihil jam timere. 6. Tum unus è bobus, & aevo & consilio gravis, facilè, inquit, erat c (qui talpa est) fallere, sed ut herum (qui Argus est) lateas. Hic labor, hoc opus est. . Mox deinde introgreditur herus, qui, ut servi negligentiam cor∣at, cuncta lustrans oculis, & praesepe mnu tentans, cervi depre∣dit sub foeno cornua, inclamat famulos, accurrunt, feram conclu∣t, capiunt. . Mor. In adversis rebus, periculis, latebrae difficiles sunt inventu, quia miseros, ut coepit, fortuna exagitar, aut, quia ipsi, meu im∣iti, consilii semet imprudentia produnt. 43. De Leone & Vulpecula. Eo aegrotabat, visebant animalia, unâ officium differente Vulpe∣cula. . Ad hanc legatum mittit leo cum epistola, quae venire admoneat, issimam rem aegroto fore ejus unius praesentiam, nec quicquam uli fore cur vulpecula metuat, leonem enim
3. Deinde aegrotum esse, & decumbere, ut etiamsi (id quod non e∣rat) velit, nocere tamen non queat. 4. Rescribit vulpecula, Optare se ut Leo convalescat, id{que} oratu∣ram superos, caeterum minimè visuram; terreri enim se vestigiis. 5. Quae quidem vestigia cum omnia sint antro leonis adversa, & nulla aversa, eam rem indicium esse, multum quidem animalium in∣troisse, sed exisse nullum. Horatius. 6. Olim quod vulpes aegroto cauta leoni, Respondit, referam; Quia me vestigia terrent, Omnia te adversum spectantia, nulla retrorsum. 7. Mor. Cave fidem habeas verbis. Ni caveris, saepe tibi dabuntur verba. 8. Capienda est conjectura tum ex verbis, tum ex factis; & ex his, illa sunt judicanda. 42. De Vulpecula & Mustela. 1. VUlpecula, longâ inediâ tenuis, fortè per angustiorem rimam ad cumeram frumenti repsit: in quâ cùm probè pasta fuit, deinde rursus tentantem egredi distentus impedit venter. 2. Mustela luctantem procul contemplata, tandem monet, si exire cupiat, ad cavum macra redeat, quò macra intraverat. 3. Mor. Videas complures in mediocritate laetos esse, atque alacres, vacuos curis, expertes animi molestiis. 4. Sin hi divites facti fuerint, videbis eos moestos incedere, nunquam frontem porrigere, plenos curis, animi molestiis obrutos. 5. Hanc fabellam sic Horatius canit, lib. 1. Epist. 7. Fortè per angustum tenuis Vulpecula rimam. Repserat in cumeram frumenti: pastaque rursus Ire foras pleno tendebat corpore, frstra. Cui Mustela procul, Si vis, ait, effugere ist hinc, Macra cavum repetas arctum,quem macra subisti. 43. De Equo & Cervo. 1. EQuus gerebat bellum cum Cervo. 2. Pulsus tandem è pascuiis, implorabat opem humanam. 3. Redit cum homine, descendit in campum; victus antea jam fit victor. 4. Sed tamen, hoste devicto & sub jugum misso, ipse victor necesse est serviat Homini. 5. Equitem fert dorso, fraenum ore. 6. Mor. Dimicant multi contra paupertatem: quâ per fortunam & industriam victâ, saepè victoris interit libertas. 7. Domini quippe & victores paupertatis servire incipiunt divitiis; anguntur avaritiae flagris, parsimoniae cohibentur fraenis: nec quae∣rendi tenent modum, nec (justo quidem avaritiae supplicio) artis rebus
8. De hac re Horatius. lib. 1. Epistolarum 10. Epist. Cervus equum pugnâ melior, communibus herbis Pellebat, donec minor in certamine longo. Imploravit opes hominis, fraenumque recepit. Sed postquam victor violens discessit ab hoste, Non equitem dorso, non fraenum depulit ore. Sic, qui pauperiem veritus, potiore metallis Libertate caret, dominum veet improbus, atque Serviet aternum, quia parvo nesciat uti. 46. De duobus Adolescentibus. 1. ADolescentes duo opsonium apud coquum sese emptúros simulant▪ 2. Coquo alias res agente, carnem alter è canistro arripit: dat socio, ut sub veste occulat. 3. Coquus subreptam sibi carnis partem ut vidit, furti utrumque coepit insimulare. 4. Qui abstulerat, per Jovem nihil habere: is verò qui habuit, nil se abstulisse identidem pejerat. 5. Ad quos, Me quidem, inquit coquus, fur nunc latet: sed is inspexit, is scit, per quem jurâstis. 6. Mor. Si quid peccavimus, id statim non sciunt homines: at Deus om∣nia videt, qui sedet super coelos & intuetur abyssos. 7. Quod si cogitent homines, suppressius prudentiusque peccabitur. 47. De Cane, & Lanio. 1. CAnis in macello, cùm lanio carnem abstulisset, in pedes sese continuo, quantum potuit conjecit. 2. Lanius, jacturâ rei perculsus, primùm tacuit: deinde animum reci∣piens, sic procul acclamavit, O furacissime curre tutus, impunè tibi licet. tutus enim es nunc ob celeritatem; posthac autem cautius observaberis. 3. Mor. Haec fabula significat, plerosque omnes tum demum fieri cautiores ubi damnum acceperint. 48. De Cane, & Ove. 1. CAnis vem in jus vocat, panem ex mutuo debere clamitans. 2. Illa it inficias. 3. Milvus, Lupus, Vultur accersuntur; rem affirmant. 4. Damnatur Ovis, damnatam canis rapit ac deglubit. 5. Mor. Ealsis Testimoniis opprimi quamplurimos, tum nemo nescit, tum haec quàm optimè docet fabellula.
49. De Agno & Lupo. 1. AGno comitanti caprum lupus fit obviàm: rogitat, cur, reli matre, olidum potius sequatur hircum: suadetque ut ad distenta  matris ubera redeat: sperans ita fore, abductum ut laniet. 2. Ille verò, Mater me, O Lupe, inquit, huic commisit: huic summa cura servandi data est: parenti potius quàm tibi obsequendum, qui me re∣ducere istis dictis postulas, subductum mox discerpere. 3. Mor. Noli omnibus fidem habere: multi enim, dum aliis videntur velce prodessè, sibi interdum consulunt. 50. De Adolescente & Cato. 1. Um adolescens quidam in deliciis amoribúsque usurpasse catum, Vene∣rem precibus fatigavit, ut catum in foeminam tranfiguraret. 2. Commiserescit & audit orantem Venus: fit metamorphosis, quae ado∣lescenti miserè amanti perplacuit: nempe, tota succi plenula, tota candidula, tota clegantula. 3. Nec vero ita multo post, percupiens experiri Dea, numquid eatus cum corpore mutâsset & mores, per impluvium immittit muscul 4. Ibi risu prorsus atque ludo res digna accidit. 5. Conspectam illicò bestiolam insequitur muliercula. 6. Venus indignans, foeminae vultus in catum mutavit. 7. Cum pedibusque manus, cum parvis brachia mutat Cruribus: & cauda est mutatis addita membris. 8. Mor. Coelum non animum mutant, qui trans mare . 9. Nimisque difficile est, assueta relinquere. 10. Horat. Naturam expellas furcā licèt, usque recuret. 51. De Agricola & Filiis. 1. COmplures habebat agricola adolescentulos, iique inter se discordes fuêre: quos pater elaborans trahere ad mutuum amorem, apposi fasciculo, jubet singulos brevi circundatum funiculo effringere. 2. Imbecilla nequicquam conatur aetatula. 3. Solvit pater, reddítque singulis virgulam; quam cùm pro  quis que vireculis facilè frangeret, O, inquit, filioli, sio concordes,  vos vincere poterit nemo. 4. Sed si mutuis volueritis sevire vulneribus, atque int estinum bellum eritis tandem praeda hostibus. 5. Mor. Docet hic Apologus, Concordia parvas res crescere, discordia mag∣nas dilabi.
52. De Rustico & Equo. 1. RUsticus equum vacuum, asinumque sarcinulis egregie onustum producit ad viam. 2. Defessus asellus equum, sibi onera ut adjuvet, orat, si salvum velit. 3. Negat facturum equus. 4. Asellus tandem sarcinae pondere gravatus procumbit, moritur. 5. Herus omne onus, mortui quoque aselli corium, in equi dorsum re∣clinat. 6. Quibus cùm ille deprimeretur, Me miserum! inquit, merito meo sic nunc excrucior, qui dudum laboranti asino opitulari nolui. 7. Mor. Monemur hac fabula, ut oppressis subveniamus amicis. 8. Ortus nostri (inquit Plato) partem sibi patria vendicat, partem amici. 53. De Carbonario & Fullone. 1. FUllonem invitabat carbonarius, ut secum in unis aedibus habitaret. 2. Fullo, non est, inquit, mi homo, istud mihi vel cerdi, vel utile, ve∣reor enim magnopere nè quae ego eluam, tu reddas tam atra quam carbo est. 3. Mor. Monemur hoc Apologo, cum inculpatis ambulare, monemur sce∣leratorum hominum consortium, velut pestem quandam, devitare. 4. Trahunt (inquit Campanus) hominum sodalitia, commercia etiam in mores penetrant, & perinde quisque evadit, ut ii quibuscum versatur. 54. De Aucupe & Palumbo. 1. IT venatum auceps videt nidulantem procul in altissima arbore palumbum adproperat, denique insidias molitur, premit calcibus anguem. 2. Hic mordere. 3. Ille, improviso exanimatus malo, Me miserum! inquit, dum alteri in∣sideor, ipse dispereo. 4. Mor. Significat haec fabella, nonnunquam eos suis artibus circumveniri, qui res uovas moliuntur. 55. De Buccinatore. 1. BUccinator quidam ab hostibus capitur, abducitur. 2. Trepidare ille, supplicare ut parcant innoxio: se, quando nihil armorum unquam praeter unam buccinam gestaverit, hominem nè potuisse quidem occidere, nedum voluisse. 3. Illi contra murmure, tum saevo tum verberibus, inonant.
4. Nil agis, scelus, maximè noces; atque nunc hìc trucidabert: quòd cùm ipse (ut sateris) sis rei militaris imperitus, cornu isto tuo aliorum exci∣tas evibrásque animos. 5. Mor. Gravissimè peccant nonnulli, qui, ad mala alioqui satis pronis principibus, ut iniquè agant, consulunt, atque hujusmodi quaedam ad illorum aures occinunt. 6. Quid etiam dubitas? An te principem esse oblitus es? An non tibi quod lubeat, licet? Tu legibus major: In te legirupae nomen cadere haud potest, qui ipsis etiam dominaris legibus. 7. Tui nihil possident, quod tuum non sit. Tu potes & servare & perdere. Tibi fas est opibus dignitatéque augere, quem visum sit. Fas est, ubi libuerit, adimere. 8. Mor. Alios alia vel damnant, vel commendant: Tibi nihil non ho∣nestissimum futurum. 56. De Lupo & Cane. 1. LUpus cani ante lucem in sylvâ forte fortuna fit obviam: salutat, ad∣ventum gratulatur: denique rogat, quo pacto tam sit nitidus. 2. Cui ille, Herilis cura hoc efficit: herus me blandientem sibi demul∣cet, de mensa pascor herili nitidissimâ, nunquam sub dio dormio; tum uni∣versae familiae dici non potest quàm sim gratus. 3. Nae tu, inquit lupus, multò es felicissimus. O canis! cui tam benignus & comis contigit herus, quocum O utinam commorari & mihi liceat: nullum me animalium esset uspiam fortunatius. 4. Canis, novi status cupidissimum videns lupum, effecturum se pollicetur, ut haereat in parte aliqua apud herum, modo de pristina ferocia, aliquid re∣mittere, & servitudinem servire, velit. 5. Stat sententia: Lupo libitum est deambulare ad villam: sermones edunt in itinere prorsus jucundissimos. 6. Postea verò cum illuxit, contritum canis ëollum videns lupus, Quid sibi vult, inquit, O Canis, tua ist haec prorsus depilata cervix? 7. Solebam, inquit ille, feroculus, notis pariter & ignotis allatrare, obmor∣deréque nonnunquam: Id aegrè ferens herus, crebris me tundebat verberibus, prohibens etiam nè quem praeter furem lupúmque adorerer. 8. Ego sic vapulando victus sum, & mitior factus, hócque genialis saevitia servavi signum. 9. Lupus, hoc audito, Ego, inquit, heri tui amicitiam tanti non emo. 10. Vale igitur, O canis, cum tuâ isthâc servitute: mihi mea potior est libertas. 11. Mor. Optabilius est humili casa dominum esse, & panem atrum vorare, quàm in amplissima regia opiparis mensis frui, & obnoxium trepidùmque de∣gere. 12. Nam, libertas subiimi exulat aula, ubi accipienda venit, & nssitanda injuria est.
57.De Agricola & Canibus. 1. AGricola cum ruri plusculos hyemâsset dies, coepit tandem necessariarum rerum penuriá laborare: interficit oves, mox & capellas, postremò heves quo{que} mactat, ut habeat quo inedia penè exhaustum corpusculum sustentet. 2. Id videntes canes, salutem fugâ quaerere constituunt; sese enim non vi∣ctuors diutius, quando nè bobus quidem, quorum in opere rustico faciendo ut ebatur operâ, pepercit herus. 3. Mor. In quam domum mercedis gratiâ te tradas, vide. 4. Nonnulli inhumanissimi sunt heri. 5. Multi enim hodiè eò dementiae prolabuntur, ut vel servos infortunio malo, & damno libenter mactent. 58. De Vulpe & Leone. 1. VUlpecula quae leonis immanitatem insuetam habebat, semel atque iterum id fortè animal contemplata, trepidare & fugitare. 2. Cum jam tertio obtulisset sese obviam leo, tantum abfuit, ut metuerit quicquam vulpes, ut confidenter illum adierit, salutaveritque. 3. Mor. Omnes nos consuetudo audaciores facit, vel apud eos quos anteae aspicere vix ausi fuimus. 59. De Vulpe & Aquila. 1. VƲlpeculae proles foràs excurrebat, ab Aquila comprehensa matris fidem implorat. 2. Accurrit illa; ut captivam prolem dimittat, Aquilam rogat. 3. Aquila, nacta praedam, ad pullos subvolat. 4. Vulpes, correpta face, quasi illius munitiones incendio absumptura esset, insequitur. 5. Cum jam arborem ascendisset, Et ipsa nunc te, inquit, tuosque si po∣tes, tuêre. 6. Trepidans aquila incendium dum metuit, Parce, inquit, mihi parvisque liberis; tuum quicquid, habeo, reddider. 7. Mor. Per Aquilam, potentis atque audacis animi homines intellige; per vulpem, pauperculos, quos calumniis premere, contumeliisque afficere divitibus aeque studium est. 8. Verùm, quando est sua & formicis ira, impotentes ii acceptam inter∣dum probe ulciscuntur injuriam. 60. De Agricola & Ciconia. 1. GRuibus anseribusque sata depascentilus, laqueum pratendit rusticus: capiuntur grues, capiuntur anseres, capitur & ciconia.
2. Supplicat illa, innocentem sese clamitans: & nec gruem nec anserem esse, sed avium omnium optimam, quippe quae parenti sedulò semper inservire, eundémque senio confectum alere consueverit. 3. Horum, inquit, nil me fugit; verum, cum nocentibus postquam te cepi∣mus, cum eis quoque morieris. 4. Mor. Qui flagitium committit, & is qui impuris se adjungit socium, pari poenâ plectuntur. 61. De Gallo & Cato. 1. VEnit ad Gallum commedendum Catus; non satis autem habens ad no∣cendum causae, gallum criminari occipit, obstreperam esse avem dicti∣tans, utpote quae voce tam acuta noctu dormientes homines expergefaciat. 2. Ille se innocentem ait, cum sic excitet ad opera mortales. 3. Catus intereà intonat; Nil agis, sceleste; cum matre rem habes, nec à sorore abstines. 4. Id gallus quoque cum expurgare niteretur; Nec hoc, inquit, perseverantius saeviens Catus, quicquam faciet; tu mihi hodiè discerperis. 5. Mor. Vetus dictum esse ait Guil. Gaudanus, Ʋt canem caedas facilè inveniri baculum. 6. Malus, si libitum fuerit, quo jure quaque injuria, te praecipitem dabit. 62. De Opilione & Agricolis. 1. PUer editiore pratulo oves pascebat, atque per jocum térque quatér{que} lu∣pum adesse clamitans, agricolas undique exciebat. 2. Illi saepius illusi, seriò auxilium imploranti dum non subveniunt, fiunt oves praedae lupo. 3. Mor. Si mentiri consueverit quispiam, huic si quando verum narrare occaeperit, haud facilè habebitur fides. 4. Superiori Apologo finitimus est ille, apud Horat. lib. 1. Epist. 17. de Plano scurrâ jocus. 5. Nec, semel irrisus, triviis attollere curat Fracto cure Planum, licet illi plurima manet Lachryma; per sanctum juratus dicat Osirim, Credite, non ludo; crudeles tollite claudum, Quare peregrinum, vicinia rauca reclamat. 63. De Aquila & Corvo. 1. RƲpe editissimâ in agni tergum devolar Aquila. 2. Videns id Corvus, imitari, velut simia, gestit Aqullam, in arietis
vellus se demittit, demissus impeditur, impeditus comprehenditur, com∣prehensus projicitur pueris. Mor. Non aliorum, sed sua se quisque virtute aestimet. 4. Tuo te pede metire, inquit Horatius. 5. Id velis, id tentes, quod possis. 64. De Cane invido & Bove. 1. PRaesepi faeni pleno decumbebat canis. 2. Venit bos ut comedat. 3. Ille sese surrigens, prohibere, 4. Bos, Dii te cum isthac invidia perdant, inquit. qui, nec foeno vesceris nec me visci sinis. 5. Mor. Eo sunt ingenio plerique, ut aliis invideant quod ipsi mentis inopia assequi nequeant. 65. De Cornicula & Ove. 1. STrepitat in oviculae dorso cornicula. 2. Ovis, Cani, inquit, si sic obstreperes, ferres infortunium. 3. At cornicula, Scio, inquit, quibus insultem; placidis molesta, saevis amica. 4. Mor. Impotenti & sincero perpetuò est cum malis parata certatio. 5. Illiditur solo innocentissimus quisque; nocentis verò, ac praeferocis ho∣minis auribus obstrepit nemo. 66. De Pavone & Luscinia. 1. PAvo apud summi Jovis sororem & conjugem Junonem, queritur, lusci∣niam suave cantillare; se ob raucam ravim ab omnibus irrideri. 2. Cui Juno, Dos sua à diis cuique: luscinia cantu, tu plumis longe su∣peras: unumquemque sua sorte decet esse contentum. 3. Mor. Quae dii largiuntur, grato sumamus animo, neque majora quae∣ramus. 4. Superi temerè agunt nihil. 67. De Mustela senicula & Muribus. . MUstela, prae senio viribus carens, mures jam, ità ut soler, insequi non valebat; meditari coepit dolum; in farinulae colliculum se illatebrat; sic sperans forte, ut citra laborem venetur. 2. Accurrunt mures, & farinam esitare dum cupiunt, ad unum omnes à mustela vorantur. 3. Mor. Ubi viribus quisp iam destitutus fuerit, ingenio opus est. 4. Lysander Lacedaemonius subinde dicere solebat, Quo non perveniret
leonina pellis, vulpinam assuendum esse. 5. Quod si lucidus dixeris, Ʋbi virtus non satis potest, adhibenda est a∣stutia. 68. De Rustico & Malo. 1. RUsticus quidam ex malo, quam in proximo habebat agello sapidissima quotannis legebat poma: hero lecta donabat urbano; illectus incredibili pomorum dulcedine, malum tandem ad se transtulit. 2. Ea veterrima repentè exaruit, atque ibi poma pariter & malus peri∣êre. 3. Quod cùm patrifamilias nuntiaretur; Heu! difficile est, inquit, anno∣sam transplantare arborem, satis supérque fuerat (si fraenos meoe novissem imponere cupiditati) fructus ramo decerpere. 4. Hanc fabellam sic Mantuanus cecinit. Rusticus ex malo dulcissima poma legebat, Ʋnde dare urbano dona solebat hero. Ast herus, illectus frugum dulcedine, malum Transtulit in laribus proxima rura suis. At quia malus erat senior, translata repente Aruit, & proles cum genitrice perit. Heu! male transfertur, senio cum induruit arbor, Inquit herus: fuerat carpere poma satis. 5. Mor. Qui. nimium sapiunt, atque inconcessa sequuntur. Desipiunt: cohibet qui sua vota, sapit. 69. De Leone & Rana. 1. AUdire vocem visus Leo, prosiliit; substitit non sine trepidatione, magni quippiam expectans. 2. Egreditur tandem aquis ranula. 3. Leo deposito metu adproperans, bestiolam proculcat pedibus. 4. Mor. Vetat hic Apologus inanes timores, ut illa à Guilielmo Gandano versa fabula, de partu montium. 70. De Formica. 1. SItiens venit ad fontem ut biberet formica, incidit fortè in puteum: o∣pitulatur eminus, ex arbore dejecto ramo, columba: Ramum con∣scendens formica, servatur. 2. Adest, columbam ut capiat, auceps; non sinit formica; aucupis pedem arripit mordicus; avolat columba. 3. Mor. Docet haec fabùla praeclarè, Moritis referendam esse gratiam.
71. De Pavone & Pica. 1. GEns avium cùm liberè vagaretur, optabat sibi dari regem. 2. Pavo se imprimis dignum qui eligeretur, putabat, quia esset for∣mosissimus. 3. Hoc in rem accepto, Pica, O Rex, inquit, si, te imperante, aquila nos perstrenuè, ut solet, insequi coeperit, quo illam modo abiges? quo nos pacto servabis? 4. Mor. In principe non tam forma, quàm corporis fortitudo spectanda opus est prudentiâ 72. De Aegroto & Medico. 1. MEdicus curàbat aegrotum: ille tandem moritur. 2. Tum ad cognatos medicus, Hic, inquit, intemperantia periit. 3. Mor. Bibacitatem & libidinem nisi quis maturè reliquerit, aut nun∣uam perveniet ad atatem, aut perbrevem est habiturus senectutem. 73. De Leone & quibusdam aliis. 1. LEo asinus, vulpes eunt venatum: capitur ampla venatio; capta par∣tiri jussa. 2. Asino singulis singulas partes ponente, irrugiit leo: asinum rapit, ac niat. 3. Postea, vulpecula id dat negotii: quae astutior cùm leoni longè op∣a propositâ. sibi vix minimam particulam reservâsset, rogat leo, à quo sic cta sit? 4. Cui illa, Hujus me, inquit, clamitans docuit: mortuum asinum ostendens. 5. Mor. Foelix quem faciunt aliena pericula cautum. 74. De Hoedo & Lupo. EFenestrâ prospectans hoedus, praetereuntem lupum convitiis incessere audebat. 2. Cui lupus, Non tu, ait, sceleste, mihi convitiaris, sed locus. 3. Mor. Et tempus & locus semper audaciam addunt homini. 75. De Asino. ASinus, de hortulani saevitiâ querens, Jovi supplicat, alium dari he∣rum. 2. Exaudire Jupiter vora asini, dat regularium: apud quem cùm tegu-graviorâque tergo vectaret onera, accessit rursum ad Jovem; orat dari mitior sit. 3. Ridere Jupiter. 4. Ille tamen non destitit instare, orare, usque adeò donec perpelleret,
5. Dat illi coriarium: quem ubi pernovit asellus, Me miserum! inquit qui dum nullo sum contentus domino, in eum inciderim, qui nec corio quidem meo (quantum auguror) parcet. 6. Mor. Semper damnamus quae praesentia sunt; & nova appetimus, quae (ut dici solet) veteribus non sunt potiora. 76. De Anu & Ancillis. 1. ANus quaedam domi habebat ancillas complures, quas quotidiè antequam lucesceret, ad galli gallinacei, quem domi habebat, cantum, excita∣bat ad opus. 2. Ancillae, quotidiani tandem negotii commotae taedio, gallum obtruncant, sperantes, jam necato illo, in medios sese dies dormituras; sed haec spes miseras frustrata est. 3. Hera enim, ut interemptum gallum rescivit, intempesta deinceps nocte surgere jubet. 4. Mor. Non pauci, gravius malum dum student evitare, in lterum diversum incidunt. 5. Pervulgatum est; Incidit in Scyllam, qui vult vitare Charybdin. 77. De Asino & Equo. 1. ASinus beatum putabat equum, quod pinguis esset & in otio degeret; se verò infoelicem dicebat, quòd macilentus esset, ac strigosus quo∣tidieque ferendis oneribus ab immiti hero exerceretur. 2. Haud multò pòst ad arma clamatum est. 3. Tum equus: Non equitem dorso, non fraenum repulit ore, Nec telum corpore. 4. Hoc viso, Asinus magnas diis gratias agebat, quod non equum se, sed asinum fecissent. 5. Mor. Miseri sunt, quos vulgus beatos judicat: & non pauci beati, qui se miserrimos putant. 6. Sutor crepidarius regem dicit foelicem, quem rerum omnium compo∣tem videt: non considerans, in quantas res & solicitudines distrahatur, dum interim ipse cum optima paupertate cantillat. 78. De Leone & Capra. 1. EDita rupe ambulantem capram fortè conspicatus Leo, monet, ut poti∣us in viride pratum descendat. 2. Capra, Facerem fortassis, inquit, si tu abesses, qui mihi non istud suades, ut ego inde ullam capiam voluptatem, sed ut tu habeas quod vores famelicus. 3. Mor. Omnibus ne habeas fidem. 4. Quidam enim non tibi, sed sibi consulunt.
79. De Vulture aliisque Avibus. 1. ANnuum se natalem celebrare adsimulat Vultur; aviculas ad coenam invitat. 2. Veniunt pleraeque omnes; venientes magno plausu faveribusque accipit. acceptas laniat Vultur. 3. Mor. Non sunt amici omnes qui blande dicunt, aut benigne se facere velle simulant. 4. Hinc Ovidius. Melle sub hyblaeo saepe venena latent. 80. De Anseribus. 1. ANseres unà cum gruibus agrum vastabant; quibus auditis, rustici protinus in illos foruntur. 2. Rusticos conspicatae avolant grues, capiuntur anseres, qui impediti cor∣poris onere subvolare non poterant 3. Mor Expugnata ab hostibus urbe, facile se subducit inops; at dives ser∣vit captus. 4. In bello divitiae magis oneri sunt quam usui. 81. De Jove & Simia. 1. JUpiter scire percupiens quisnam mortalium scitissimos ederet liberos, con∣vocari jubet quicquid uspiam est animantium. 2. Concurrunt ad Jovem undique. 3. Aderat jam alitum pecudumque genus, inter quas & simia. deformes ca∣tulos brachia gestans; cum advenisset, à risu nemo temperare potuit; quinetiam Jupiter ipse profuse admodum risit. 4. Ibi continuò simia ipsa; Imò inquit, novit & Jupiter judex noster, ca∣tulos meos magnopere omnes, quotquot adsunt, praecellere. 5. Mor. Suum cuique pulchrum, ut est adagium. 6. Et alibi apud Theocrium in Idylliis Quae minime sunt pulchra, ea pulchra videntur amanti. 82. De Quercu & Arundine. 1. FAstus olim adeo insolentiae plena quercus arundinem aggressa est; Si nunc, inquie is pectus ammosum est tibi, procede agidum, ad pugnam, ut noster duarum eventus ostendat utra viribus praester. 2. Arundo quercus tantam exultationem fortidudinisque jactationem va∣nam nihil mirata, sic respondit, Certamen nunc abnuo, nec meae sortis me piget. 3. Nam, etsi in omnem partem mobilis, tempestares tamen pervinco sono∣ras; tu si semel vasto rex Aeolus antro luctantes emiserit ventos, concides, & mihi tum rideberis. 4. Mor. Declarat hoec fabula, non semper eos fortissimos esse, qui
(nulla etiam lacessiti injurià) aliis insultant. 83. De Piscatore & Pisciculo. 1. PIscator, jacto in aquam hamo cibis illito, pisciculum eduxit. 2. Orat obsecátque captivus, se minutulum ut abire sinat, & adolescere, ut postea majore potiatur. 3. Piscator. Ego, inquit, spem pritio non emam: quippe qui eo fuerim ingenio semper, ut, quicquid possem, mallem auferre potius in praesentia. 4. Mor. Haec nos monet fabella, ne certa incertorum spe unquam amitta∣mus. 5. Quid enim stultius, ut est apud Ciceronem, quàm incerta pro certis habere? 84. De Formica & Cicada. 1. APpetente hyeme, frumentum in arcam, ad solem trahebat formica. 2. Vidit id Cicada, accurrit, rogitat granum. 3. Formica, Cur non inquit, & tu, meo exemplo, aestate trahis quod∣cunque potes, atque addis acervo? 4. Respondet illa sibi id temporis cantando transigi. 5. Ridens formica, Si. air, aestate cantare soles, merito nunc esuris. 6. Mor. Monemur hâc fabellâ, dum adhuc robur corporis adest, quaerere ea quibus imbecilla sustentetur senectus. 85. De Leone & Tauro. 1. LEonem fugiebat taurus, in hircum incidit: is cornus & caperatâ minitabatur fronte. 2. Ad quem plenus irarum taurus, Non tua, inquit, in rugas contracta frons me territat: sed immanem metuo leonem, qui nisi tergo haereret meo, jam scires, non ita parvam rem esse pugnare cum rauro, & nostro sequi de vulnere sanguinem. 3. Mor. Calamitosis non est addenda calamitas. 4. Sat miser est, qui semel est miser. 86. De Nutrice & Lupo. 1. NUtrix minatur puerum plorantem, ni taceat, datum iri Lupo. 2. Lupus id forte audit: spe cibi manet ad fores. 3. Puer tandem silescit obrepente somno. 4. Regreditur lupus in sylvam, jejunus & inanis. 5. Vulpes ubi sit praeda, sciscitatur. 6. Gemebundus ille, Verba, inquit, mihi data sunt: puerum plorantem abjicere minabatur nutrix, at fefellit.
7. Mor. Foeminoe non est adhibenda fides. 87. De Testudine & Aquila. 1. CEperat testudinem toedium reptandi. 2. Si quis eam in coelum tolleret, pollicetur baccas maris rubri. 3. Sustulit eam Aquila. 4. Poscit praemium. 5. Non habentem fodit unguibus. 6. Ità testudo, quae concupiit videre astra, in astris vitam reliquit. 7. Mor. Tua sorte sis contentus. 8. Fuere nonnulli, qui, si mansissent humiles, poterant esse tuti: facti sublimes, inciderunt in pericula. 88. De Cancris Matre & Filio. 1. CAncrum retrogradum monet mater, antrorsum ut eat, 2. Filius respondet, Mater, I prae, sequar. 3. Mor. Nullum reprehenderis vitii, cujus ipse queas reprehendi. 89. De Sole & Aquilone. 1. SOl & Aquilo certant, uter sit fortior. 2. Conventum est experiri vires in viatorem, ut palmam ferat qui excusserit manticam. 3. Boreas horrisono nimbo viatorem aggreditur; at ille non desistit ami∣ctum gradiendo duplicare. 4. Assumit vires sol, qui, nimbo paulatim evicto, emolitur radios. 5. Incipit viator aestuare, sudare, anhelare. 6. Tandem progredi nequiens, captat frigus opacum, atque sub frondoso nemore, abjecta mantica, resedit: ita Soli contigit victoria, 7. Mor. Quicum certes, etiam at que etiam vide. 8. Nam etsi tu fortior es, est forsitan alius te fortior: aut si non fortior, certè callidior, ut consilio suo tuum vincat robur. 90. De Asino. 1. ASinus venit in sylvam, offendit exuvias leonis; quibus indutus redit in pascua, greges armentaque territat & fugat. 2. Venit qui perdiderat, quaeritat suum Asinum. 3. Asinus, viso hero occurrit: imò cum rugitu suo incurrit. 4. At herus, prehensis, quae extabant, auriculis; Alios licet, inquit, fal∣las; te, aselle mi, prolè nevi.
8. Mor. Quod non es, nec te esse simules: non doctum, cùm sis indoctus: non divitem, nobilem, cum sis pauper & ignobilis, te jactes, 9. Vero enim comperto, rideberis. 91. De Rana & Vulpe. 1. RAna egressa paludem, in sylvis apud feras medicinam profitetur. 2. Ait, se nec Hippocrati, nec Galeno cedere. 3. Caeteris habentibus fidem, illusit vulpes. 4. An haec, inquit, medicinae habebitur perita, cui sic pallet os? 5. Quin curet seipsam. 6. Sic illusit vulpes; est enim ranae os, caeruleo colore. 7. Mor. Stultitiae est, profiteri quod nescis, & ridiculum. 92. De Cane Mordaci. 1. CAni subinde homines mordenti, ut sibi quisque caveret, alligavit do∣minus nolam. 2. Canis, ratus virtuti suae tributum decus, suos populares despicit. 3. Accedit ad hunc canem aliquis jam aetate & authoritate gravis, monens eum nè erret: nam ista, inquit, nola data est tibi in dedecus, non in decus. 4. Mor. Gloriosus interdum sibi ducit laudi, quod ipsi est vituperio. 93. De Camelo. 1. CAmelus, sui poenitens, querebatur, tauros insignes ire geminis cor∣nubus se inermem objectum caeteris animalibus. 2. Orat Jovem donare sibi cornua. 3. Ridet Jupiter stultitiam cameli, nec modo votum negat, verùm & auriculas decurtat. 4. Mor. Sit quisque fortunâ contentus suâ. 5. Etenim, multi fortunam sequuti meliorem, incurrêre pjorem. 94. De duobus Amicis & Ʋrso. 1. DUo amici faciunt iter, occurrit in itinere ursus. 2. Unus, arbore conscensâ, periculum evitat: alter, cum sper fuga non esset, collidit se humi. 3. Accedit bellua, contrectat jacentem, os explorat & aures. 4. Homine spiritum continente ac motum, ursus qui mortuis parcit, ratus cadaver esse, innocuus discedit. 5. Percunctante posteà socio, quidnam bestia dixisset jacenti in aurem;
hoc monuisse, ait, Nè unquam cum illiusmodi amicis iter faceret. 6. Mor. Rara avis in terris nigroque simillima cygno, fides est. 7. Verum amicum res adversae & pericula designant. 95. De Equite calvo. 1. EQues calvus illigârat pileo comam fictitiam. 2. Venit in campum acri spirante Boreâ: ac, dum male ob∣servat capillatum galerum, subitò apparet calvities. 3. Tollit cachinuum corona, nec non & ipse ridet. 4. Quid novi est, inquit, avolare capillos alienos, cîm olim fluxe∣rint qui fuerant mei? 5. Mor. Belle fecit eques, qui non est indignatus, sed cum ridenti∣bus risit. 6. Socrates verò, cùm, accepisset in soro alapam, hoc modo respon∣dit; Molestum esse, nescire homines, quando debeant prodire cum galea. 96. De duabus Ollis. 1. DUAE ollae stetêre in ripa: altera erat lutea, altera aerea: u∣tramque tulit vis fluvii. 2. Luteae collisionem metuenti respondet aerea, nè quid timeat: sese enim nè collidantur satis curaturam. 3. Tum altera, seu me, inquit, tecum, sen te mecum flumen col∣liserit, cum meo utrumque siet periculo. 4. Quare certum est à te separari. 5. Mor. Satius est vivere cum socio pari, quam cum potentiori. 6. A potentiori enim potest esse periculum tibi, non illi à te. 97. De Rustico & Fortuna. 1. RUsticus, cum araret, offendebat in sulcis the saurum: gratias agit telluri, quae hunc edidisset. 2. Fortuna videns nihil honoris haberi sibi, ita est secum locuta. 3. Thesauro reperto stolidus mihi non est gratus; at eo ipso the∣sauro postea amisso, me primam omnium votis & clamore solicitabit. 4. Mor. Beneficio accepto, grati simus, bene de nobis merenti. 5. Ingratitudo enim digna est etiam beneficio, quod jam accepe∣rit, privari. 98. De Tauro & Capro. 1. FUgit leonem taurus; venit ad speluncam quaerens latibulum. 2. Intranti occursat cornibus, qui intus erat, caper. 3. Tum his verbis bos emugit: Tu quidem cornibus tuis meam excipis
fugam: verùm si abierit, quem fugio; quantum à viribus tauri distet caper, tum senties. 4. Mor. Qui nescit, miseris esse succurrendum, aut certè non no∣cendum, caper est. 5. Quisquis enim â miserorum injuriis non temperaverit, si (ut est for∣tuna mutabilis) miseris redierit felicitas, nimirum nocuisse miseris eum poenitebit. 99. De Simia & ejus Prole. 1. OMnes animantes suo conspectui Jupiter adesse jusserat, cujus∣nam soboles esset pulcherrima, judicaturus. 2. Properant ferae, advolant aves, nec non ad id certamen adna∣tant pisces. 3. Omnium postrema festinat Simia, trahens secum suam prolem. 4. Cujus quidem prolis foedas nates cunctis ridentibus, sic inquit: Maneat, cui saverit Jupiter, victoria: meo tamen judicio, hic meus natus est bellus, & omnium natis jure praeferendus. 5. Hoc dicto, subrisit & Jupiter. 6. Mor. Et nos & nostra nobis placent. 7. Sed de nobis & nostris factis aliorum sit judicium; ne, si ipst judicemus, cum Simiâ rideamur. 100. De Pavone & Grue. 1. PAvo & Grus unà coenant. 2. Pavo se jactat, caudam ostentat, gruem contemnit. 3. Grus fatetur pavonem formosis esse pennis: se tamen, dum vioc tectis supervolat pavo, animoso volatu penetrare nubes. 4. Mor. Nemo alterum contempserit. 5. Sua cuique dos, su cuique est virtus. 6. Qui tuâ virtute caret, forsan habet quâ careas tu. 101. De Quercu & Arundine. 1. VAlidiore Noto effracta quercus in flumen praecipitatur, fluitat, haeret forte ramis suis in arundine. 2. Miratur arundinem in tanto turbine stare incolumem. 3. Haec respondet, cedendo & declinando esse iuram, inclinare ad Notum, ad Boream, ad omnem statum. 4. Nec mirum esse quod quercus exciderit, quae non cedere, sed resistore, concupivit. 5. Mor. Potentiori nè resistas, sed hunc cedendo & ferendo vincas. 6. Quod pulchre docet facundissimus poetarum Virgilius. Nata Deâ, quò fata trabunt retrahuntque sequamur: Quicquid erit, superanda omnis, fortuna ferondo est.
102. De Tigride & Vulpe. 1. VEnator jaculis agitabat feras. 2. Tigris jubet omnes feras absistere; sese unam ait bellum confecturam. 3. Pergit venator jaculari. 4. Tigris oppido sauciatur. 5. Fugientem è praelio, telumque extrahentem percontatur vulpes, Quisnam valentem belluam tam valdè vulnerasset. 6. Respondet, se authorem vulneris haud nosse: verum ex vulne∣ris magnitudine capere se conjecturam, aliquem fuisse virum. 7. Mor. Fortes plerumque sunt temerarii: & ars vim, ingenium for∣titudinem superat. 103. De Tauris & Leone. 1. QUatuor fuêre tauri, quibus placuit communem ipsorum esse salu∣tem, & commune periculum. 2. Vidit leo simul pascentes; etsi esurit, tamen conjunctos aggredi metuit. 3. Primum, dat operam verbis fallacibus segregare; tum segre∣gatos laniat. 4. Mor. Concordia nihil est firmius: discordia etiam fortes reddit imbecilles. 104. De Abiete & Dumis. 1. FErtur olim abies despicere dumos: jactat se proceram esse, locari in aedibus, cum velo stare in navibus: Dumos autem hu∣miles, viles, nulli usui idoneos. 2. Quorum quidem tale fuit responsum: Tu sanè, Abies, tuis glo∣riare bonis, & nostris insultas malis. 3. Verum nec tua refers mala, & nostra praeteris bona. 4. Cum tu sonanti detruncare securi, quàm velles tum nobis, qui se∣curi sumus, esse te similem. 5. Mor. Et summae fortunae sua insunt mala, & humili fortunae sua bona. 6. Ut nil aliud nunc dicam, haec secura est ac tuta, illa nec extra metum est, nec caret periculo. 7. Horatius canit in Lyricis, —Celsae graviore casu Decidunt turres; feriuntque summos Fulmina montes. 105. De Piscatore & Pisciculo. 1. SUbductus hamo pisciculus, orat piscatorem se dimittat. 2. Ait modò se à matre fusum; atque mensam, cum adhuc minutus sit, non multum juvare. Si dimittat, postea grandem ultro ad hamum ejus rediturum. 3. Piscator negat se dimissurum praedam certam, licet exiguam.
4. Quid habeam, inquit, scio; quid sim habiturus, nescio: Ego spem pretio non emam. 5. Mor. Certum praestat incerto, praesens futuro; esi nonnunquam exile commodum omissum, attulit magnum. 106. De Alite & Pullis ejus. 1. ALes positos in segete pullos monet, ut, dum ipsa abest, diligenter attendant, si fiat Sermo de occasione. 2. Redeunti à pastu matri, pulli anxii narrant, dominum agri operam illam mandasse vicinis. 3. Respondet, nihil esse periculi. 4. Item alio die trepidi aiunt, rogatos ad metendum esse amicos. 5. Iterum jubet illa, ut sint securt. 6. Tertiò, ut audivit ipsum dominum cum filio statuisse, postero mane, cum falce messem intrare; Jam, inquit, tempus est, ut sugiamus. 7. Vicinos & amicos non timui, quia non venturos scivi. 8. Timeo dominum, illi enim res cordi est. 9. Mor. Socordes alienis rebus plerique sumus; quòd si quid rectè curatum velis, alteri nè mandes, sed cures ipse. 107. De Avaro & Invido. 1. DUO homines orabant Jovem, cupidus, & invidus. 2. Mittitur à Jove Apollo, per hunc ut eorum votis satisfiat; dat hic utrique optandi liberam facultatem, hac conditione, ut quod∣cunque petisset alter id ipsum alter acciperet duplicatum. 3. Haeret diu cupidus, cùm nihil putat sore satis. 4. Petit tandem non pauca, & duplum accipit socius. 5. Porro, invidus hoc petit, ut ipse uno privetur oculorum, laetus socium mulctandum esse utroque. 6. Mor. Avaritiam quid potest satiare? 7. Invidiā verò dementius est nihil; quae dummodo noceat alteri, sibimet impreacatur malum. 108. De Leone & Capella. 1. VIdet leo pendêre dumosa de rupe capellam. 2. Suadet descendere, ut in campo thymum salicesque carpat. 3. Recusat capella descendere; verba quidem ejus haud sanè mala, sed mentem esse plenam doli, reclamans. 4. Mor. Cogita quis quid saadeat. 5. Multi suadent utilia non tibi, sed sibi.
109. De Cornice & Ʋrna. 1. SItibunda cornix reperit urnam aquae; sed erat urna prefundior, quàm ut posset à cornice aqua contingi. 2. Conatur effundere urnam, nec valet. 3. Tum lectos ex arena scrupulos injectat; hoc modo aqua levatur, & cornix bibet. 4. Mor. Interdum id, quod non potes efficere vi, efficies prudentià & consilio. 110. De Leone & Venatore. 1. LIgat leo cum venatore. 2. Suam praesert fortitudinem, hominis fortitudini. 3. Post longa jurgiae, venator ducit leonem ad Mausoleum, in quo sculptus erat leo caput deponens in gremium viri. 4. Negat fera, id satis esse idicii. 5. Homines enim sculpere quod vellent, ait; quod si & leones fo∣rent artifices, jam virum sculptum iri sub pedibus leonis. 6. Mor. Quisque quoad potest, & dicit & facit, quod suae parti & causae putat prodsse. 111. De Puero & Fure. 1. SEdebat puer flens apud puieum. 2. Fur rogat causam flendi. 3. Puer dicit, rupto fune incidisse in aquas urnam auri. 4. Homo exuit se, insulit in puteum, quaerit. 5. Vase non invento, conscendit, atque ibi nec puerum, nec suam invenit tunicam. 6. Puer quippe sublatâ fugerat. 7. Mor. Falluntur interdum, qui fallere solent. 112. De Rustico & Juvenco. 1. ERat rustico juvencus, vinculi omnisque jugi impatiens. 2. Homo astutulus bestiae resecat cornua (cornibus enim pe∣tebat,) tum jungit non currui sed aratro, ne, ut solet, herum pul∣saret calcibus. 3. Stivam ipse tenet, gaudens industria effecisse, ut jam foret tutus, & à cornibus, & ab ungulis. 4. Sed quid evenit? Taurus subinde resistens, spargendo pedibus, os caputque rustici opplet arenâ. 5. Mor. Sunt nonnulli sic intractabiles, ut nullâ queant arte, nullo consilio tractari.
113. De Satyro & Viatore. 1. SAtyrus, qui deus memorum olim est habitus, viatorem nive ob∣rutum, atque algore enectum, miseratus, ducit in antrum suum, fovet igne. 2. Spirantem autem in manus percontatur causam, qui respondens, ut calesiat, inquit. 3. Postea cùm accumberent, sufflat viator in polentam; quod cur faceret interrogatus, ut frigescat, inquit. 4. Tunc continuò Sutyrus viatorèm ejiciens, Nolo, inquit, in meo sit antro, cui tam diversum est os. 5. Mor. Cave sit in tuo convictu homo duplici ore, quique in sermone est Proteus. 114. De Apro & Rustico. 1. APro vastanti segetes rusticus praecidit auricu'am. 2. Iterum deprehenso praecidit alteram. 3. Et tunc quoque redeuntem capit, captum portat in urbem, de∣stinatum lautitiae sui paroni. 4. Secta jam in convivio belluâ, nusquam apparet cor. 5. Excandescente hero, & flagitante coquos, villicus respondet; Patrone, non est mirum non apparere cor: credo stultum aprum nun∣quam cor habuisse. 6. Nam si cor habuisset, nunquam in poenam suam ad meas sege∣tes toties rediisset. 7. Sic rusticus. 8. At omnes convivae emori risu, cachinnari de stultitia rustici. 9. Mor. Multorum hominum est adeò excors vita, ut an cor habe∣ant possis ambigere. 115. De Tauro & Mure. 1. MUS tauri pedem momorderat fugiens in antrum suum. 2. Taurus vibrat cornua, quaerit hostem, nusquam videt. 3. Irridet eum mus; quia, inquit, robustus es, ac vallus, non id∣circo quemvis contempseris. 4. Nunc te, & quidem gratis, laesit exiguus mus. 5. Mor. Tritum est illud verbum, quod significantiùs nostrate linguâ dixerim, Let no man be too heedless of his enemy. Latine sic: Nemo hostem suum flocci pendat. 116. De Rustico & Hercule. 1. RUstici currus haeret in profundo luto. 2. Mox supinus deum Herculem implorat. 3. Intonut vox è coelo: Inepte, inquit, flagella equos, & ipse annitere
rotis, atque tum Herculem vocato. 4. Tum enim aderit Hercules vocatus. 5. Mor. Nil prosunt otiosa vota, quae sanè Deus non audit. Juva te∣met, inquiunt; ipse tum juvabit te Deus. 117. De Ansere. 1. FUit anser qui ponebat ova aurea, singulis diebus singula. 2. Dominus, ut subitò fiat dives, anserem jugulat; sperans intus latere gazam. 3. Sed ansere invénto vacuo, stupet miser, anxiéque dehinc suspi∣rat, ac plangit, & rem & spem periisse. 4. Mor. Moderanda sunt vota. Curandum est, ne vel praeproperi simus vel nimili. Nam & festinantia nocet: & qui plura, quàm decet, quaerit, interdum acquirit nihil. 118. De Cicada & Formica. 1. CUM per aestatem cicada cantat, formica suam exercet messem; trahit in antrum grana, reponens in hyemem. 2. Saeviente brumâ, famelica cicada venit ad formicam, mendicat victum. 3. Renuit formica, dictitans sese, dum illa cantabat, laborâsse. 4. Mor. Qui segnis est in juventâ, egebit in senectâ; & qui non parcit, olim mendicabit. 119. De Simia & duobus ejus Natis. 1. SImia, ut ferunt, cùm peperit gemellos, alterum diligit, alte∣rum negligit. 2. Erat puerpera cum gemellis, atque cum incidisset terror, vitatu∣ra periculum, dilectum prehendit ulnis, quem (dum praeceps fugitat) collidit petrae, atque enecat. 3. Neglectus autem, qui in hirsuto haeserat tergo fugientis, man∣sit incolumis. 4. Mor. Solet evenire, ut ipsi parentes, filio quem tenere amant, prae nimia indulgentia sint mali occasio & periculi; eo, quem minùs amant, praestante se strenuum ac probum. 120. De Bove & Juvenco. 1. BOS jam grandis aevo quotidie trahebat aratrum. 2. Juvencus laboris expers, vicinis exultat in pascuis, ac tan∣dem insultat fortunae senioris. 3. Jactat se jugi ac vinculi inscium, se liberum, se otiosum: illi attritum esse labore collum. 4. Denique se glabrum, ac nitidum: illum esse hirsutum ac squa∣lidum.
5. Senior tum quidem nihil contra; sed brevi post tempore videt hunc insultorem duci ad aras, ac tum hisce verbis affatur. 6. Quo tua mollis vita pervenit? 7. Securum istud otium rediit ad securim. 8. Jam saltem (ut opinor) potius suades mihi laborem, qui me tu∣etur, quàm otium, quod nunc te traxit ad necem. 9. Mor. Ad vitàm rectè gerendam opus est labore & vigilantiâ. 10. Socors autem & voluptati deditus, suarum rerum, quem nollet, sortitur exitum. 121. De Cane & Leone. 1. OCcurrit canis leoni, jocatur; Quid tu miser exhaustus inediā percurris sylvas & devia? 2. Me specta pinguem ac nitidum; atque haec non labore conse∣quor, sed otio. 3. Tum leo, habes quidem tuas epulas; sed habes, stolide, etiam vincula. 4. Tu servus esto, qui servire potes; ego quidem sum liber, nec servire volo. 5. Mor. Pulchrè respondit leo; quibustibet enim rebus potior est libertas. 122. De Piscibus. 1. PIscis fluviatilis vi fluminis correptus est in mare, ubi suam effe∣rens nobilitatem, omne marinum genus, vili pendehat. 2. Non tulit hoc phoca, sed ait, tunc fore indicium Nobilitatis, si cum phoca captus portetur ad forum. 3. Se emptum iri à Nobil bus, illum autem à plebe. 4. Mor. Multi sic capti sunt libidine gloriae, ut sese ipsi praedient & jactent. 5. Sed laus sui oris non datur homini laudi, at excipitur cum au∣ditorum risu. 123. De Pardo & Vulpecula. 1. PArdus, cui pictum est tergum; caeteris seris, etiam leonibus de∣specti, intumscebat. 2. Accedit ad hunc vulpecula, suadet non superbire, dicens, Illi quidem speciosam esse pellam, sibi vero speciosam esse mentem. 3. Mor. Discrimen est bonorum, & ordo. 4. Bona corporis praestant bonis fortunae: utrisque illis animi bona praeferantur oportet. 124. De Vulpecula & Pardale. 1. CUM aliquando pardalis vulpem prae se contemneret, quòd ipsa pellem haberet omnigenis colorum maculis variegatam. Respon∣dit vulpes, sibi id decoris in animo esse, quod illi esset in cute. 2. Mor. Neque verò pauls saius est ingenio praeditum esse vsro, quàm cute versicolere.
125. De Vulpe & Fele. 1. CUM aliquando vulpes in colloquio, quod illi erat cum fele, jacta∣ret sibi varias esse technas, adeò ut vel peram haberet dolis re∣fertam: Felis autem respondit, sibi unicam duntaxat artem esse cui fideret, si quid esset discriminis. 2. Inter confabulandum, repentè canum accurentium tumultus auditur. 3. Ibi felis in arborem altissimam subsiliit, cùm vulpes interim à canum agmine cincta capitur. 4. Mor. Innuit fabula, praestabilius esse nonnunquam unicum consi∣lium, modò id sit verum, & efficax, quam plures dolos, consiliaque frivola. 126. De Rege & Simiis. 1. REX quidam Aegyptius aliquot simias instituit, ut saltandi ra∣tionem perdiscerent. 2. Ut enim nullum animal ad figuram hominis propiùs accedit; ità nec aliud actus humanos aut melius, aut libentius, imitatur. 3. Artem itaque saltandi protinus edoctae saltare coeperunt insignibus indutae purpureis, ac personatae: multoque jam tempore mirum in modum placebat spectaculum; donec è spectatoribus facetus quispiam, nuces, quas clanculum in sinu gestabat, in medium abjecit. 4. Ibi statim simiae, simulatque nuces vidissent, oblitae choreae, id esse coe perunt, quod antea fuerunt: ac repentè è saltatricibus in simias redie∣runt, contritisque personis, dilaceratisque vestibus, pro nucibus inter se pugnabant non sine maximo spectatorum risu. 5. Mor. Admonet haec fabula, fortunae ornamenta non mutare ho∣minis ingenium. 127. De Asino & Viatoribus. 1. DUO quidam cùm in desertis locis asinum quempiam fortè for∣tuna nacti esseut, contendere inter se coeperunt, uter eorum, uti suum, domum abduceret. 2. Nam utrique pariter à fortunâ videbatur objectus. 3. Hac interim de re illis invicem altercantibus, asinus sese subduxit, ac neuter eo potitus est. 4. Mor. Quidam à praesentibus commodis, quibus ob inscitiam uti nesciunt, excidunt. 128. De Piscatoribus. 1. PIscatores aliquot, jacto rti, testudines eduxerunt. 2. Eas cum essent inter se partiti, neque sufficerent omnibus comedendis: Mercurium fortè accedentem, invitârunt ad convivium. 3. At is, intelligens se neutiquam humanitatis gratiâ vocari, sed ut eos fastidio cibi sublevaret recusavit; jussitque ut ipsi suas testudines e∣derent, quas cepissent.
4. Mor. Nonnulli, posteaquam inconsultè quippiam adorti sunt, aliorum implorant auxdium, quos suo negotio admisceant. 129. De Asino. 1. APud Cumanos asinus quispiam pertaesus servitutem, abrupto loro in sylvam aufugerat; illic fortè repertus leonis exuvias cor∣pori applicabat suo, atque ita pro leone se gerebat, homines pariter ac feras voce caudaque territans. 2. Nam Cumani leonem ignorant. 3. Ad hunc igitur modum regnabat aliquamdiu personatus hic asinus, pro leone immani habitus ac formidatus, donec hospes quispiam Cumas profectus (qui saepenumero viderat & leonem, & asinum, atque ob id non erat ei difficile dignoscere) aurium prominentium indicio, at∣que aliis quibusdam conjecturis, asinum esse deprehendit, ac probe fustigatum reduxit, dominoque agnoscenti reddidit. 4. Interim autem risum non mediocrem concitabat omnibus Cumanis asinus jam agnitus, quos dudum, creditus leo, metu propemodum exa∣nimaverat. 5. Mor. Hand facilè tegimus vitia, quae à pueris nobiscum ado∣leverunt. 130. De Scarabaeo & Aquila. 1. SCarabaeus aliquando spretus ab aquilâ, coepit de vindicta quoquo pacto sumenda cogitare. 2. Pervestigavit ubinam aquila nidum collocâsset, adrepsit scara∣baeus, & ova simili dolo dejcit. 3. Aquila cum saepius domicilium commutâsset, neque quicquam proficeret, Jovem patronum adiit, exponit calamitatem suam. 4. Is jubet, ut suo in gremio ponat ova, vel istic in tuto futura. 5. Et huc per vestis laecinias, sinusque prorepsit pertinax scarabae∣us, haud quaquam sentiente Jove. 6. Deinde ubi videt ova commoveri Jupiter, éque satis animad∣verteret, territus rei novitate, excusso gremio in terram dejeccit. 7. Mor. Monet haec fabella, neminem, quantumvis pusillum, con∣temnendum esse. 131. De Satyro & Rustico. 1. SAtyrus quidam cum vehementer àlgeret, hyberno glu supra mo∣dum saeviente, à rustico quodam inductus est in hospitium. 2. Admiratus autem cur homo inflaret in manus ori admotas, roga∣vit cur ita faceret. 3. Is respondit, Ut frigidas manus halitûs tepore calefaceret. 4. Deinde ubi, extracto foco, appositâ mensâ, in pultem fervidam rur∣sum inflaret, magis etiam admiratus, sciscitatus est quid hoc sibi vult.
5. Uti pultem, inquit ille, nimium ferventem halitu refrigerem. 6. Tum Satyrus surgens à mensa, Quid ego audio, inquit? 7. Tune eodem ex ore pariter & calidum & frigidum efflas? 8. Valebis. 9. Neque enim mihi ratio est cum ejusmodi homine commune habere hospitium. 10. Mor. Notantur bilingues, qui eundem modò laudant, modò vituperant. 132. De Cassra & ejus Pullis. 1. AESopus ille Phrygiae Fabulator, haud immerito sapieus existi∣matus est, cùm quae utilia monitu suasuque erant, non seve∣rè non imperiose praecepit, & censuit, ut Philosophis mos est; sed festi∣vos delectabilesque Apologos commentos res salubriter ac prospicienter animadversas, in mentes animosque hominum cum audiendi quadam illecebra induxit. 2. Velut haec ejus fabella de aviculae nidulo, lepide atque jucunde praemonet spem fiduciamque rerum, quas efficere quis possit haud un∣quam in alio, sed semet ipso habendam. 3. Avicula inquit est parva, nomen est cassita, habitat, nidulatur∣que in segetibus id ferme temporis, quo appetit messis, pullis jamjam plumantibus. 4. Ea cassita in sementes forte concesserat tempestiviores; propterea frumentis flavescentibus pulli etiam tunc involucres erant. 5. Cùm igitur ipsa iret cibum pullis quaesitum, monet eos, ut si quid ibi novae rei sieret, dicereturve, animadverterent, idque uti sibi, ubi rediisset, renunciarent. 6. Dominus postea sagetum illarum, filium adolescentem vocat, &, Videsne, inquit, haec ematuruisse, & manus jam postulare. 7. Idcirco die crastino, ubi primum diluculabit, fac amicos adeas, & roges, ut veniant, operamque mutuam dent, & messem hanc nobis adjuvent. 8. Haec ubi dixit, discessit; atque ubi rediit cassita, pulli trepiduti circumstrepere, orareque matrem, ut statim jam properet, atque ali∣um in locum sese asportet. 9. Nam dominus, inquiunt, misit filium, qui amicos rogaret, ut luce oriente veniant, & metant. 10. Mater jubet eos, à metu otiosos esse. 11. Si enim dominus, inquit, messem ad amicos rejecit, crastino se∣ges non metetur, neque necesse est hodie uti vos auferam. 12. Die igitur postero, mater in pabulum volat; dominus quos ro∣gaverat, operitur: Sol fervet, & sit nihil, & amici nuili erant. 13. Tum ille rursum ad filium, Amici isti, inquit, magnam in par∣tem cessatores sunt: quin potius imus, & cognatos, affines, vicinos∣que nostros oramus, ut adsint cras tempore ad metendum. 14. Itidem hoc pulli pavefacti matri nunciant.
15. Mater hortatur, ut tum quoque sine metu, ac sine cura sint: cognatos affinesque nullos fermè tam esse obsequibiles, ait, ut ad la∣borem capessendum nihil cunctentur, & statim dicto obediant: Vos modo, inquit, advertite, si modo quid denuò dicitur. 16. Aliâ luce oriâ, avis in pastum profecta est; cognati & affines operâ, quam dare rogati sunt, supersedent. 17. Ad postremum igitur dominus silio, Valeant, inquit, amici cum propinquis; afferes primâ luce falces duas: unam egomet mihi, & tu tibi capies alteram, & frumentum nosmetipsi manibus nostris cras metemus. 18. Id ubi ex pullis dixisse dominum, mater audivit; Tempus, in∣quit, est cedendi & abeundi. 19. Fiet nunc dubio procul quod futurum dixit. 20. In ipso enim jam vertitur, cuja est res, non in alio unde petitur. 21. Atque ita cassita nido miravit & seges à domino demessa est. 22. Mor. Haec quidem est Aesopi fabula, de amicorum plerumque & propinquorum levi & inani fiducia. 23. Sed quid aliud sanctiores libri Philosophorum monent, quàm t nobis tantum ipsis nitamur; alia autem omnia, quae extra nos, extraque nostrum animum sunt, neque pro nostris, neque nobis ducamus. 24. Hunc Aesopi Apologum Ennius in Satyris scitè admodum & ve∣nusto versibus quadratis composuit: quorum duo postremi isti sunt, quos habere corde & memoria, opere praetium esse hercle puto. 25. Hoc tibi erit a gamenium semper in promptu situm, Ne quid expecta amicos, quod tu agere possis. 133. De Avibus & Noctua. 1. AVes olim propè universae noctuam adierunt, rogaruntque eam nè post hac in aedium cavis nidificaret, sed in arborum potius ramis, atque inter frondes; ibi enm vernari suavius. 2. Quin, eidem quercum modò enatam, pusillam, tenellamque ad∣huc, offendebant; in qua scilicet, molliter, ut aiebant, & sedere ipsa aliquando noctua, & saum sibi construere nidum posset. 3. At illa facturam se negavit. 4. Qum invicem consilium dedit iis, ne arbusculae illi se crederent. 5. Laturam enim quandoque esse viscum, pestem videlicet avium. 6. Contempsêre illae (ut sunt leve genus & volaticum) sapientis u∣nius Noctuae consilium. 7. Jam quercus adoleverat, jam patula, jam frondosa erat. 8. Ecce, ibi aves illae omnes gregatim ramis involitant, lasciviunt, subsultant, colludunt, cantillant. 9. Interea, quercus ea viscum protulerat, atque id homines anim∣adverterant; implicitae ergò repente ibi omnes pariter misellae; ac frustra eas sera poenitentia subiit, quod salubre illud consilium sprevissent.
10. Atque hoc esse aiunt, cur nunc aves omnes, ubi noctuam viderint, frequentes eam quasi salutant, deducunt, sectantur, circumdant, circum∣volitant. 11. Etenim consilii illius memores, admirantur eam nunc ut sapi∣entem stipantque densa caterva, ut videlicet ab eâ sapere aliquando discant. 12. Sed opinor frustra, imò verò, etiam interdum cum magno ip∣sarum malo. 13. Nam veteres illae noctuae revera sapientes erant: nunc multae noctuae sunt, quae noctuarum quidem plumas habent, & oculos, & ro∣strum, sapientiam verò non habent. 14. Mor. Benè monentis consilia ne spernas, haec fabula docet. 134. De Cucurbita & Pino. 1. SAta est olim cucurbita juxta arborem pinum, quae grandis admo∣dum & ramis patulis exstabat. 2. Cucurbita verò, cùm multis pluviis atque coeli temperamento crevisset, lascivire incepit, & ramulos audacius porrigere. 3. Jam serpebat in pinum, jam surgere, jam ramos & frondes in∣volvere audebat; ampliora folia, candentes flores, praegrandia poma & vire scentia ostentans. 4. Itaque tanto fastù atque insolentia intumuit ut pinum arborem ausa sit aggredi: & vides, inquit, ut te supero, ut amplis foliis, ut virore praesto, & jamjam ad cacumen praesurgo. 5. Tum pinus, quae senili prudentiâ & robore pollebat, nihil mirata est cucurbitae insolentis audaciam, sed ita ad eam respondit. 6. Ego hic multas hyemes, calores, aestus, variasque calamitates per∣vici, & adhuc integra consillo. 7. Tu ad primos rigores minus audaciae habebis, cum & folia con∣cident, & viror omnis aberit. 8. Mor. Secundis rebus non est superbiendum. 135. De Corvo & Lupo. 1. COrvus lupos per ardua montium juga comitatus, partem sibi praedae fieri postulat, quia eos secutus nullo tempore destitu∣isset, sociusque fuisset. 2. Repulsus deinde est à lupis tanquam non eos, sed praedam cibum∣que secutus; nec minùs luporum, si occiderentur, quàm caeterorum animalium exta fuisset voraturus. 3. Mor Non quid agamus semper inspiciendum est, sed quo simus animo cum agamus. 136. De partu Terrae. 1. TUrgida olim facta tellus, & mirum in modum tumida magnum aliquod paritura videbatur. 2. Accurrunt finitimi, stupent agricolae, terrae partum inter spem metumque expectant. 3. Alii Typhoea illum centimanum, ali montes erupturos putabant.
4. Aperitur terra, prodiit Mus; & quod miraculo fore omnibus existimabatur in risum atque jocum converterunt. 5. Mor. Non semper credendum promissis magnificis. 137. De Membris & Ventre. 1. HUmani artus, cùm ventrem otiosum vidèrent, ab eo discordâ∣runt, & suum illi ministerium negaverunt. 2. Cùm eo pacto & ipsi quoque deficerent, intellexerunt ventrem cibos acceptos per omnia membra dividere; & cum eo in gratiam re∣dierunt. 3. Mor. Magnae res discordiâ pereunt; concordiâ valent. 138. De Arione & Delphine. 1 VEtus & nobilis Arion cantator fidibus fuit. 2. Is loco & oppido Methymnaeus, terrâ atque insulâ Les∣bius fuit. 3. Eum Arionem rex Corinthi Periander, amicum amatumque ha∣buit, artis graiâ 4. Is inde a rege proficiscitur, terras inclytas Siciliam atque Itali∣um visurus. 5. Ubi eò venit, auresque omnium mentesque in utriusque terrae urbibus emulsit, in quaestibus istîc & voluptatibus amoribusque homi∣num fuit. 6. Is tum postea grandi pecuniâ & re bonâ multâ copiosus, Corin∣thum instituit redire. 7. Navem igitur, & nautas ut notiores amicioresque sibi Corinthios delegit, sed eo Corinthii homino accepto, navique in altum provecta, praedae pecuniaeque cupidi▪ ceperunt consilium de necando Arione. 8. Tum illum, ibi pernicie intellecta, pecuniam caeteraque sua ut haberent dedisse; vita modò sibi parcerent oravisse. 9. Nautas precum ejus harum comisertos esse illatenus, ut ei necem inferre per vim suis manibus temperarent; sed imperavisse, ut jam statim coràm desiliret praeceps in mare. 10. Homo ibi territus & spe omni vitae perdita, id unum postea o∣ravit, ut priusquam mortem oppeteret, iuduere permitterent sua sibi indumenta, & sides capere, & canere carmen casús illius sui consolabile. 11. Feros & immanes nautas prolubium tum audiendi subit. 12. Quod oraverat, impetra. 13. Atque ibi mo de more cinctus, amictus, ornatus, stansque in summae puppis foro, carmen quod Orihyum dicitur voce subaltissima cantavit. 14. Ad postrema cantûs, cum sidibus ornatuque omni, sicut stabat canebatque, jecit sesocul in profundum. 15. Nautae, haudquaquam dubitantes quin periisset, cursum quem facere coeperant tenuerunt. 16. Sed novum, & mirum, & pium facinus contigit: Delphinum repentè inter undas adnavisse, & dorso super fluctus edito vectavisse, incolumique cum corpore & ornatu, Taenarum in terram Laconicam devexisse.
17. Tum Arionem prorsus ex eo loco Corinthum petivisse, talemque Periandro regi, qualis Delphino vectus fuerat, sefe obtulisse, eique rem (sicuti acciderat) narravisse. 18. Regem isthaec parum credidisse, Arionem (quasi falleret) cu∣stodiri jussisse, nautas requisitos, obligato Arione, dissimulanter inter∣rogasse, Ecquid audissent, in iis locis unde venissent, super Arionem. 19. Eos dixisse, Hominem, cum inde irent, in terra Italia fuisse, e∣umque illic benè agitare, & studiis delectationibusque urbium florere, atque in gratia pecuniaque magna fortunatum esse. 20. Tum inter haec eorum verba, Arionem cum fidibus & indu∣mentis, cum quibus se in salum ejaculaverat, extitisse. 21. Nautas stupefactos convictosque, ire inficias non quîsse. 22. Mor. Documento est haec fabula, plus aliquando inveniri in brutis animalibus clementiae, quàm in his hominibus, qui praeter opes nihil habent per: praeter siguram, nihil humanitatis. 139. De Aranea & Podagra. 1. ARanea, paululum à texendi opere quietior, animi relaxandi gratiâ, commodum deambulabat. 2. Huic se obvium praebet Podagra, tametsi passibus ambiguis ad∣modum aegre illum assequeretu. 3. Ejus diei itinere utcunque emenso, non longe aberant ab oppidulo, cui regionis incolae Tyche nomen indiderunt. 4. Ʋtrique Consilium fuit, conditionis suae hospitem pervestigare. 5. Aranea, non maximopere datâ operâ, in opulenti cujusdam civis aedes divertit: inibi quaquaversum telas suas praependebat, praetende∣batque retia. 6. Aderant illico nescio qui trygodaemones, qui textrinam illius de∣moliebantur. 7. Momentaneum itaque erat ipsius, quo etiam cunque se verteret, aedisicium. 8. Nusquam enim scopariorum oculatas scopas poterat effugere. 9. Misera plane, quae it tanta rerum omnium affluentia sola ange∣batur perturbaturque. 10. Podagra vero, mendicabuli instar, vix tandem egestosi cujuspiam tuguriolum impetrârat: id loci cum decubuisset, nihil non experieba∣tur miseriarum. 11. Apponebatur coenaturienti panis cibarius, aridis vix saucibus hianti hydropoterium. 12. Jamque diurno intinere labascenti torus ligneus, nullis frondibus, nullo gramine, sed praetenuibus pale is insternebatur. 13. Atque dicere non est hujus instituti, quàm convenerint malè membris mollibus, cuticulae (ut ita dixerim) holosericae, stragula tam dura, tam barbari villi. 14. Oriente igitur vix tandem illo augusto Sydere, quod exaudit, quod intuetur omnia, convenère rursum aranea simul & podagra. 15. Prior aranea praeteritae notis molestias, tot locorum commu∣tationes denarrat: nunc hero exprobrans munditiem, nunc nimiam scopariorum observantiam.
16. Podagra contrà de hospitis sui egestate complura comminiscitur; nec otium habet admonstrare araneae lividas vibices, quos adamantina fulcra tenellae cuticulae impresserunt. 17 Consilium ineunt araneam deinceps pauperum toguria, podagram verò divitum aulas debere subingredi; in hanc aranea pedibus, podagra animis vadit sententiam. 18. Veruntamen tenebris jamjam increscentibus urbi cuipiam sese ap∣proximant. 19. Podagra, instituti non immemor, pedeterntim se in nummosi cu∣jusdam domum illatebravit. 20. Qua commodum ab hero conspecta, dii boni, qua benevolentia, qua humanitate, quibus nominibus excipitur! 21. Supponuntur, substernunturque olorinae culcitrae, toralia perdictam subalaribus plumis referta. 22. Taceo vinum dulce, vinum nigrum, Lesbium, Tarentinum. 23. Taceo fideculas, phasianos atque eas aviculas quae binis superbi∣unt coloribus. 24. In summa nihil deliciarum, nihil voluptatum non exhauriebat. 25. Aranea, pauperis casam ingressa, telas orditur, quaquaversum parietes interpatent, retia suspendit. 26. Orbiculari operi manibus pedibusque incuml it, reficit abrupta, perficit incepta: & ut dicam breviter, vacua dominatur in aula. 27. Nullas insidias, nullos formidat insultus: imò verò etiam jam scopis superior omnibus. 28. Non multo post, podagra araneam convenit, delicias suas, feli∣citatem, fortunas ampliter exornat. 29. Aranea miris laudibus extotit imperium suum, aedisicandi, texen∣dique libertatem. 30. Placuit tandem haec utrique sententia: quosumcunque proficisce∣rentur, podagram in divitum domos, araneam in pauperm tuguria debere divertere. 31. Mor. Apologus hic tametsi ad usus varios accommodari queat, id tamen imprimis declarat, alium alio loco fortunatioem esse. 32. Praetera morborum domicilia esse divitum aulas. 33. Ad ultimum nusquam libertatem majorem, quam ubi divitiarum minus. 140. De Mure in cista nato. 1. MUS in cista natus, omnem ibi serè duxerat aetatem nucibus pa∣stus quae in ea servar solebant. 2. Dum autem circa oras cistae ludens decidisset, quaereretque ascen∣sum reperit pulas lautissimè paratas. 3. Quas cum gustare coepisset, quàm stultus, inquit, hactenus sui, qui in toto terrarum orbe nihil melius eistula mea esse creeam, Ecce, quàm suavioribus hic vescor cibis! 4. Mor. Haec sabula indicat, non ità patriam diligendam, ignobilis si sit, ut alia non adeamus loca, cum alibi beatiores esse possimus.
141. De Rustico, impetrante ut Triticum absque aristis nasceretur. 1. IMpetraverat à Cerere rusticus, ut triticum absque aristis nasce∣retur, nè metentium, triturantiumque manus laederet: quod ubi iharuit, à minutis avibus depastum est. 2. Tum rusticus, Quam digna, inquit, patior, qui parvae commoditatis causa emolumenta quam maxima perdidi. 3. Mor. Fabula indicat; parva incommoda majori utilitate pensanda. 142. De Accipitre Columbam insequente. 1. CUM accipiter columbam praecipiti insequeretur olatu, villam ingressus, à rustico captus est. 2. Quem blande, ut se dimitteret, obsecrabat; Non enim te laesi, dixit. 3. Cui Rusticus, Nec haec, respondit, te laeserat. 4. Mor. Fabula indicat, merito puniri, qui innocentes laedere conantur. 143. De Aranea & Hirundine. 1. ARanea in hirundinem excandescens, quae muscas, qui suus est cibus, capiebat, retia, in foribus per quas volitare solebat, ut eum caperet, suspenderat. 2. Hirundo verò advolans, retia cum textrice per aera portabat. 3. Tum aranea in aere pendens, & sese jamjam perituram in∣telligens. 4. Quam justè haec patior, dicebat, quae minima volatilia magno la∣bore vix capiens, credidi tam magnas aves posse comprehendere. 5. Mor. Hac monemur fabula, ne viribus majora aggrediamur. 144. De Rustico amnem transituro. 1. RUsticus torrentem transiturus, qui forte imbribus excreverat, quaerebat vadum. 2. Et cum primum eam fluminis partem tentâsset, quae quietior, placidiorque videbatur, reperit eam altiorem quam animo erat o∣pinatus. 3. Rursus ubi breviorem tutioremque adinvenit, ibi majori strepitu fluvius decurrebat. 4. Tum secum, quàm tutius, inquit, clamosis aquis, quàm quietis & silentibus, vitam nostram credere possumus. 5. Mor. Hac admonemur fabula, ut minùs verboos & minaces, quàm quietos extimescamus.
145. De Columba & Pica. 1. COlumba interrogata à pica, quid eam induceret, ut in eodem semper loco nidificaret, cùm ejus pulli, inde sibi semper sur∣riperentur; 2. Simplicitas, respondit. 3. Mor. Haec indicat fabula, facilè viros probos saepe decipi. 146. De Cuculo & Accipitre. 1. IRrisus ab accipitre cuculus, quod cum sibi & corpore par, & colore non absimilis esset, (prae angustiâ animi) potius vermibus terre∣nis, quam suavibus aliarum avium carnibus, vesceretur. 2. Vidit paucis post diebus, accipitrem à rustico, cujus columbas insectabatur, captum, ad metum caeterorum ex alta turre pendêre. 3. Cui cuculus, quàm melius tibi, inquit, amice, fuisset vermes venari quàm altends aves impetere. 4. Mor. Haec fabula indicat, eorum vitam tutiorem esse, & magis probandam, qui suis rebus sine periculo sunt contenti, quam illorum, qui aliena appelentes, adeunt magna vitae discrimina. 147. De Asino & Vitulo. 1. ASinus & vitulus, in eodem pascentes prato, sonitu companae hostilem exercitum adventare praesenserant. 2. Tum vitulus, Fugiamus hinc, O sodalis, inquit, n hostes no captivos abducant. 3. Fuge tu, inquit, quem hostes occidere & esse consueverunt. 4. Asini nihil interest, cui ubique eadem ferendi oneris est proposita conditio. 5. Mor. Haec fabula servos admonet, ne dominos magnopere mu∣tare formident, modo prioribus deteriores futuri non sint. 148. De Vulpe & Mulieribas Gallinas edentibus. 1. VUlpes juxta villam quandam transiens, conspexit catervam mu∣lierum plurimas gallinas opipare assatas alto silentio comedentem. 2. Ad quas conversa, Qui clamores, inquit, & canum latratus con∣tra me essent, si ego facerem quod vos facitis? 3. Cui respondens quaedam anus, pessima animalium, inquit, nos quae nostra sunt comedimus; tu verò aliena furaris. 4. Mor. Haec fabula nos admonet, ne putemus nobis in aliena licere, quod propriis dominis licet.
149. De Caponibus pinguibus & macro. 1. VIR quidam complures capones in eodem ornithobsco inclusos largo nutrica verat cibo, qui pingues effecti sunt omnes praeter unum, quem ut macilentum irridebant. 2. Dominus, nobi es hospites lauto & sumptuoso accepturus convivi, imperat coquo, ut ex his interimat coquatque quos pinguiores in∣venerit. 3. Hoc audientes corpulenti, sese afflictabant, dicentes, Quantò praestitisset nos macilentos esse? 4. Mo. Haec fabula in pauperum solamen consicta est, quorum vita tutior est quàm divitum. 150. De Trabe & Bobus eam trabentibus. 1. TRabs ulmea de bobus conquerebatur, dicens, Ingrati, ego multo tempore meis vos frondibus alui; vos verò me nutricem ve∣stram per saxa & luta trahitis. 2. Cui boves, Gemitus suspiriáque nostra, & stimulus quo pungi∣mur, te docere possunt, quod te trahimus inviti. 3. Ignovit trabs. 4. Mor. Haec nos docet fabula, nè in eos excandescamus, qui non sua sponte nos laedunt. 151. De Arboribus pulchris & deformi. 1. ARbores complures in eodem creverant loco, procerae, rectae, enodesque praeter unum humilem, parvam, nodosamque, quam ut deformem pusillamque caeterae ludibrio babere solitae erant. 2. Aedificaturus domum loco dominus, jubet omnes excidi, praeter eam quae brevitate & deformitate sua aedificium indecorum redditura videbatur. 3. Caeteris excisis, deformis haec secum dicebat; De te non am∣plius querar, Natura, quod me turpem genueris, cum formosis tam magna videam imminere discrimina. 4. Mor. Haec fabula nos admonet, nè doleamus nos natos esse de∣formes, cùm multis formositas saepe nocuerit. 152. De Cygno in morte canente, reprehenso à Ciconia. 1. CYgnus moriens interrogabatur à Ciconia, cur in morte (quam caetera animalia adeò exhorrent) multò suaviores, quam in omni vita, emitteret sonos, cum potius moeus esse debèret. 2. Cui cygnus, quia, inquit, neque cibi quaerendi cura ampius cruci∣abor, neque aucupum laqueos extimescam. 3. Mor. Haec fabula admonet, nè mortem formidemus, qua omnes vitae praesentis miseriae praeciduntur.
153. De Muliere, Virum morientem flente, & Parente eam consolante. 1. MUlierem adhuc juvenem, cujus vir animam agebat, parens consolabatur, dicens, Nè te afflictes, nè tantopere lugeas, fi∣lia: alium enim virum tibi inveni, isto longe formosiorem, qui pri∣oris defiderium facilè mitigabit. 2. At mulier doloris impatiens (ut quae maritum ardente amore pro∣sequebatur) non modo verba parentis non admittebat, sed intempesti∣vam alterius mariti mentionem accusabat. 3. At ubi maritum defunctum videt, inter lachrymas & luctus pa∣rentem interrogat, an adsit juvenis ille quem sibi in virum dare velle se dixerat? 4. Mor. Fabula indicat, quàm citò defunctorum maritorum amor ex uxorum animo excidere soleat. 154. De Muliere amatoris discessum flente. 1. MƲlier impudica amatorem suum abeuntem, quem omnibus fere rebus spoliaverat, multis lachrymis prosequebatur. 2. Interrogante autem eam vicina, cur ita inconsolabiliter fleret; Non discessum ejus, inquit, sed pallium, quod ei reliqui fle. 3. Mor. Fabula indicat, Non amatores, sed eorum bona à mere∣tricibus amari. 155. De Musca, quae quadrigis insidens, pulverem so excitasse dicebat. 1. QUadrigae in stadio currebant, quibus musca insidebat. 2. Maximo autem pulvere, tum equorum pedum pulsu, tum rotarum volutatione, exorto, dicebat musca, Quàm magnam vim pulve∣ris excitavi? 2. Mor. Haec fabula ad eos spectat, qui, cum ignavi sunt, alie∣nam tamen gloriam suis magnificis verbis in se transferre conantur. 156. De Anguilla conquerente, quòd magis quam Serpens infestaretur. 1. ANguilla interrogabat serpentem, quare, cùm similes esseat at∣que cognati, homines tamen se potius quam illum inseque∣rentur. 2. Cui serpens, Quia rarò, inquit, me laedunt impune. 3. Mor. Haec fabula indicat, minus laedi solere, qui sese ulciscuntur.
157. De Asino, Simia & Talpa. 1. COnquerenti Asino quod cornibus careret, Simia verò quod cau∣da sibi deesset; Tacere inquit Talpa, cum me oculis captam esse videatis. 2. Mor. Haec fabula ad eos pertinet, qui non sunt sua sorte conten∣ti; qui si aliorum infortunia considerent, aequiore animo tolerarent sua. 158. De Nautis, Sanctorum auxilium implorantibus. 1. NAuta quidam, in mari subita & aira tempestate deprehensus, caeteris ejus sociis diversorum divorum auxilium imploranti∣bus, Nescitis, inquit, quid petatis. 2. Ante enim quàm Sancti isti ad Deum, pro nostra libertate se con∣ferant, hac imminente procella obruemur. 3. Ad eum igitur confugiendum censeo, qui absque alterius admi∣niculo à tantis malis nos poterit liberare. 4. Invocato igitur Dei omnipotentis auxilio illico procella cessavit. 5. Mor. Fabula indicat, Ubi potentioris auxilium haberi potest, ad imbecilliores non confugiendum. 159. De Piscibus, è sartagine in prunas desilientibus. 1. PIsces adhuc vivi in sartagine ferventi oleo coquebantur: quorum unus, Fugiamus hinc, fratres, inquit, nè pereamus. 2. Tum omnes pariter è sartagine exilientes, in ardentes prunas de∣ciderunt. 3. Majore igitur dolore affecti, damnabant consilium quod ceperant, dicentes, Quanto atrociori nunc morte perimus? 4. Mor. Haec nos admonet fabula, ut ita praesentia vitemus pericu∣la nè incidamus in graviora. 160. De Quadrupedibus, societatem adversus Aves cum Piscibus ineuntibus. 1. QUadrupedes, cùm bellum sibi ab avibus esset indictum, cum pis∣cibus foedus ineunt, ut eorum auxilio se ab avium furore tu∣erentur. 2. Cum autem optata expectarent auxilia, pisces negant se per ter∣ram ad eos accedere posse. 3. Mor. Haec nos admonet fabula, nè eos nobis socios faciamus, qui, cum opus sit nobis, adesse non possunt.
161. De Legato avaro tubicines decipiente. 1. QUidam avarus pro patria Legatus, in aliam urbem profectus erat, cui tubicines praestò affuerunt, ut illios aures tubarum clangore, locules autem suos pecuniâ implerent. 2. Quibus ille renunciari jubet, non esse nunc locum cantibus, se in summo luctu & moerore constitutum; matrem enim suam obiisse. 3. Tubicines autem spe frustrati & moesti abeunt. 4. Amicus quidam legati audiens luctum, ad eum visendum con∣solandumque accedit interrogatque quamdudum mater ejus obiisset? 5. Quadraginta jam anni sunt inquit. 6. Tunc amicus, intellectâ legati strophâ, in risum effusus est. 7. Mor. Haec fabula ad avaros facit, qui omni arte student conser∣vare pecuniam. 162. De viro, qui ad Cardinalem nuper creatam, gra∣tulandi gratia, accessii. 1. VIR quidam factus admodum, & urbanus audiens amieum su∣um ad Cardinalaius dignitatem adsumptum, ad eum gratu∣landi gratiâ accessit. 2. Qui honore tumidus, amicum veterem agnoscere dissimulans quis∣nam esset, interrogabat. 3. Cui ille (ut erat ad jocos promptus) Miseresco, inquit, tibi cae∣terisque qui ad hujusmodi honores perveniunt. 4. Quamprimum enim dignitates ejusmodi estis assecuti, visum, au∣ditumque & caeteros sensus ita amittitis, ut pristinos amicos amplius non dignoscatis. 5. Mor. Haec fabula eos notat, qui in alium sublati, veteres despici∣unt amicitias. 163. De Juvene senis curvitatem irridente. 1. JUvenis quidam conspicatus senem in arem tensi similitudinem curvum interrogavit, An sibi arcum vellet vendere? 2. Cui ille, Ecquid est tibi opus pecuniam amittere? 3. Si enim ad meam perveneris aetatem, absque pecunia arcum tibi natura concedet. 4. Mor. Haec fabula indicat, minimè irridenda vitia senilis aetatis, quam nemo vivendo effugere potest. 164. De Sene, puellam in uxorem accipiente. 1. VIR quidam imprudens exacto septuagesimo vitae auno puellam duxerat in uxorem qui ad id tempus in coelibatu permansisset. 2. Cui cum debitum solvere non posset, dicere solebat; Quam ma∣lè vitam meam disposui?
3. Juveni enim mihi uxor deerat; nunc autem senex desum uxori. 4. Mor. Haec fabula innuit, omnia suo tempore peragenda. 165. De Aquila & Pica. 1. PIca aquilam rogabat, ut se inter suos familiares & domesticos acciperet: 2. Quando id meretur, cùm corporis pulchritudine, tum ad manda∣ta peragenda linguae volubilitate. 3. Cui aquila, Hoc facerem, respondit, ni vererer, nè quae intrae tegulam fiant, tuâ loquacitate cuncta efferres. 4. Mor. Haec fabula monet, linguaces & garrulos domi non ha∣bendos. 166. De Turdo amicitiam cum Hirundine ineunte. 1. GLoriabatur turdus, se amicitiam contraxisse cum hirundine. 2. Cui mater, stultus es, fili, inquit, si credis cum ea posse convivere, cum uterque vestrum diversa soleant appetere loca. 3. Tu enim frigidis, illa tepidis delectatur locis. 4. Mor. Hâc monemur fabella, ne eos nobis faciamus amicos, quorum vita à nostra dissentit. 167. De Rustico & Mure. 1. RUsticus quidam erat admodm pauper: sed adeo facetus, ut nè calamitatis quidem tempore nativi leporis oblivisceretur. 2. Is cum villam suam casu igne injecto ita ardentem videret, ut aliquo modo ignem extinguere posse diffideret, moestus spectat in∣cendium. 3. Interim cernit murem quendam, qui villa egressus periculum quàm ocyssimè fugiebat. 4. Oblitus damnorum rusticus cucurrit, & murem corripiens, illum in medium jecit incendium, dicens, 5. Ingratum animal, tempore felicitatis mecum habitâsti; nunc quia fortuna mutata, est villam meam deseruisti. 6. Mor. Fabula indicat, eos non esse veros amicos, qui arridente fortuna à latere tuo discedunt: turbata autem praecipiti abeunt cursu. 168. De Divite quodam & Servo. 1. VIR erat dives, servum habens tardi ingenii, quem Regem stultorum solebat nuncupare. 2. Ille hi verbis saepe irritatus, statuit hero par referre.
3. Semel enim in herum conversus, utinam, inquit, rex stultorom essem. 4. In toto enim terrarum orbe, nullum meo latius esset imperium; & tu quoque meo subesses imperio. 5. Mor. Fabula significat, omnia plena esse stultorum. 169. De Canibus Ʋrbanis, Villaticum insequentibus. 1. CAnes complures urbani quendam villaticum praecipiti inseque∣bantur cursu, quos diu ille fugit, nec repugnare ausus est. 2. At ubi ad insequentes conversus substitit, & dentes ipse quoque ostendere coepit, omnes pariter substiterunt, nec aliquis urbanorum ap∣propinquare audebat. 3. Tunc Imperator exercitûs, qui forte ibi aderat, ad suos conversus milites, 4. Mor. Commilitones, inquit, hoc spectaculum nos admonet, nè fugiamus, cum praesentiora fugientibus, quam repugnantibus, videa∣mus imminere perscula. 170. De Anu Daemonem accusante. 1. VOlunt homines ut plurimum, (quando sua culpa, aliquid sibi acciderit adversi) in fortunam, vel in daemonem culpam con∣ferre, ut se crimine exuant; adeo omnes sibi indulgent. 2. Hoc daemon egrè ferens, cùm videret anum quandam, arborem ascendentem, ex quâ illam ruituram, & in se culpam collaturam prae∣videret, ascitis testibus dixit; 3. Videte anum illam absque meo consilio arborem ascendentem, unde eam casuram esse prospicio. 4. Estote mihi testes, me ei non suasisse, ut soleata illam arbo∣rem ascenderet. 5. Mox anus cecidit, & cum interrogarunt, cur soleata arborem ascendisset, Daemon inquit, me impulit. 6. Tunc Daemon, adductis testibus, probavit id ab anu absque suo factum esse consilio. 7. Mor. Fabula indicat homines minime venia dignos, qui cum li∣bere peccent, fortunam vel daemonem accusant. 171. De Testudine & Ranis. 1. TEstudo conspicata ranas, quae in eodem stagno pascebantur, adeò leves, agilesque, ut facile quolibet prosilirent, & longistime salirent, naturam accusabat, quod se tardum animal, & maximo im∣peditum onere procreasset, ut neque facile se movere posset, & magna assiduè mole premeretur. 2. At ubi vidit ranas anguillarum escam fieri, cujuscunque vel le∣vissimo ictui obnoxias, aliquantulum recreata, dicebat, 3. Quanto melius est onus, quo ad omnes ictus munita sum, ferre, quam tot mortis subire discrimina? 4. Mor. Haec fabula indicat, ne aegre seramus dona naturae, quae majori
nobis commodo saepe sunt, quam nos intelligere valcamus. 172. De Gliribus quercum eruere volentibus. 1. GLires quercum arborem glandiferam, dentibus eruere destina∣verunt: quò paratiorem haberent cibum, ne victûs gratia o∣ties ascendere & descendere cogerentur. 2. Sed quidam ex his, qui aetate & usu rerum ac prudentia caeteris longe anteibat, eos absterruit, dicens; 3. Si nutricem nostram nunc interficiemus, quis futuris annis nobis ac posteris alimenta praebebit? 4. Mor. Fabula haec monet, virum prudentem debere non modò praesentia intueri, verùm etiam futura longè prospicere. 173. De Cane & Hero. 1. CAnem quidam habens, quò magis ab illo diligeretur, semper eum suis pascebat manibus, ligatumque solvebat. 2. Ligari autem, & verberari jubebat à servo: ut beneficia à se, maleficia autem à servo in illum viderentur esse collata. 3. Aegrè autem ferens canis se assiduè ligari, verberatique, aufu∣git; & cùm increparetur à domino ut ingratus, & tantorum benefi∣ciorum immemor, qui à se fugisset, à quo semper dilectus pastusque fuisset, ligatus autem verberatusque nunquam, respondit. 4. Quod servus tuo jussu facit, à te factum puto. 5. Mor. Haec fabula indicat, eos malefactores habendos, qui male∣ficiorum cause fuêre. 174. De Avibus Scarabaeos timentibus. 1. MAgnus timor aves incesserat, nè Scarabaei arcu pilari eas oc∣ciderent; à quibus magnam pilarum vim in sterquilinio summo labore fabricatam audierant. 2. Tunc passer, Nolite, inquit, expavescere. 3. Quomodo enim pilas in nos per aera volantes jacere poterunt, cum eas per terram magno molimine vix trahant? 4. Mor. Haec fabula nos admonet, nè hostium opes extimescamus, quibus deesse videmus ingenium. 175. De Ʋrso & Apibus. 1. URsus ictus ab ape tanta ira percitus est, ut alvearia, in quibus apes mellificaverunt tota unguibus discerperet. 2. Tunc apes universae, cùm domos suas dirui, cibaria auferri, fi∣lios necari viderent, facto impetu, aculeis ursum invadentes pene ne∣cavère. 3. Qui ex earum manibus vix elapsus secum dicebat; 4. Quanto melius erat, apis unius aculeum tolerare, quàm tot in me hostes mea iracundia concitare? 5. Mor. Haec fabula innuit, longè melius interdum esse injuriam unius
sustinere, quàm dum unum punire volumus, multos nobis inimicos comparare. 176. De Aucupe & Fringilla. 1. AUceps tetenderat volucribus retia, largamque illis in area effude∣rat escam, pascentes tamen aves non capiebat, quia sibi vide∣bantur paucae. 2. Quibus pastis, ac avolantibus, aliae pastum adveniut, quas quoque propter paucitatem capere neglexit. 2. Hoc per totum dim ordine servato, ac aliis advenientibus, alii abeuntibus, illo semper majorem praedam expectante, tandem advespera∣scere coepit. 4. Tunc auceps amissâ spe multas capiendi, cum jam tempus esset quiescendi, attrahens, retia, unam tantum fringillam, quae infelix in area remanserat, cepit. 5. Mor. Haec fabula indicat, qui omnia comprehendere volunt, saepe pauca vix capere posse. 177. De Milite & duobus Equis. 1. MIles equum habens optimum, emit alium nequaquam illi bo∣nitate parem, quem multo diligentius quam priorem nutriebat. 2. Tunc priori sic ait, Cur me dominus quam te impensius curat? cum tibi neque pulchritudine, neque robore, neque velocitate compa∣randus sim. 3. Cui ille, Est haec, inquit, hominum natura, ut semper in novos hospites benigniores sint. 4. Mor. Haec fabula indicat hominum amentiam, qui nova, eti∣am si deteriora sint, solent veteribus anteponere. 178. De Sue & Cane. 1. SUS irridebat canem odorisequum, qui dominio murmure, & cauda a dulabatur, à quo artem aucupatriam multis verberibus, auri∣umque vellicationibus fuerat instructus. 2. Cui canis, Nescis, inquit, insane, nescis, quae ex verberibus il∣lis sum consecutus. 3. Per ea enim suavissimis perdicum coiurnicumque carnibus vescor. 4. Mor. Haec fabula nos monet, nè iniquo feramus animo praecepto∣rum verbera, quae multorum bonorum causa esse consuevêre. 179. De Trabe, Boum pigritiam increpante. 1. TRabs quae curru vehebatur, boves ut lentulos increpabat, dicens, Currite pigri, Onus enim leve portatis. 2. Cui boves, Irrides nos, responderunt, ignoras quae te poena maneat. 3. Onus hoc nos oitò deponemus, tum autm tu quoad rumparis, su∣stinere cogeris. 4. Indoluit trabs, nec amplius boves convitiis lacessere ausa est.
5. Mor. Haec fabula quemlibet monet, nè aliorum insultet calami∣tatibus, cùm ipse possit majoribus subjici. 180. De Carduele & Puero. 1. CArduelis avis interrogata à puero, à quo in deliciis habita, & sua∣vibus & largis cibis nutrita fuerat; cur caveâ egressa, regredi nollet: Ut meo, inquit, me arbitratu, non tuo pafcere possim. 2. Mor. Haec fabula indicat, vitae libertatem cunctis deliciis ante∣ponendam. 181. De Scurrâ & Episcopo. 1. SCurra quidam Calendis Januarii ad Episcopum quendam, divi∣tem quidem sed avarum, accedens, numisma aureum strenae no∣mine petiit. 2. Antistes insanire hominem dixit, qui crederet tantam pecuniam sibi in strenam dari. 3. Tunc scurra nummum argenteum efflagitare coepit. 4. Sed cum ille hoc quoque nimium sibi videri diceret, aereum qua∣drantem, ut saltem sibi traderet, orabat. 5. Sed cùm nè hunc quoque posset ab Episcopo extorquere; Reverende, inquit, pater, saltem, benedictione tuâ me pro strenâ imperti. 6. Tunc Episcopus, Flecte, inquit, genua, fili, ut te benedicam. 7. At ego, inquit scurra, benedictionem istam tuam tam vilem nolo. 8. Si enim nummum aereum valeret, eam mihi nunquam profecto concederes. 9. Mor. Haec fabula contra eos Episcopos & Sacerdotes confecta est, qui divitias & opes pluris faciunt, quam cuncta Ecclesiae sacra & mysteria. 182. De Ʋpupa indignè honorata. 1. INvitatae ferè omnes aves ad Aquilae nuptias, indignè ferebant u∣pupam caeteris praeferri, quia coronâ insignis esset, & veisicolori∣bus pennis ornata, cùm semper inter stercora & sordes solita esset vo∣lutare. 2. Mor. Haec fabula stultitiam eorum arguit qui in hominibus hono∣randis potius vestium nuorem, praestantiamque formae, quàm virtutes moresque soleant attendere. 183. De Sacerdote & Pyris. 1. SAcerdos quidam gulosus extra patriam ad nuptias proficiscens, ad quas fuerat invitatus, reperit in itinere pyrorum acervum; quo∣rum nè unum quidem attigit, quamvis magnâ affectus fame. 2. Quin potius ea ludibrio habens, lotio conspersit. 3. Indignabatur enim hujusmodi cibos sibi in itinere offerri qui ad lautas accedebat epulas. 4. Sed cum in itinere torrentem quendam ita imbribus auctum of∣fendisset, ut sine vitae periculo eum transire non posset, domum redire constituit. 5. Revertens autem jejunus, tantâ est oppressus fame, ut nisi pyra illa quae
urina consperserat comedisset, cum aliud non inveniret, extinctus fuisset. 6. Mor. Haec fabula monet, nihil esse contemendum, cùm nihil sit tam vile & abjectum quod aliquando usui esse non possit. 184. De Mulo & Equo. 1. MUlus conspiciens equum aureo fraeno ephippioque insignem, & purpureis opertum phaleris, rumpebatur invidià, illum beatum reputans qui continuè optimis vesceretur cibis, & decoro amiciretur or∣natu; se autem prae illo infelicem, qui clitellis male delaiis oppressus, quotidiè maxima onera fere cogeretur. 2. At ubi vidit equum è pugnâ redeuntem, multis affectum vulneri∣bus, prae illius calamitate se felicem appellabat, longe melius esse di∣cens, Quotidiano labore durum victum quaeritare & iurpiter vestiri. quà post optimos & delicatos cibos, & tantos ornatus, mortis adire discrimina. 3. Mor. Haec fabula monet, regibus & principibus minimè inviden∣dum, quia divitiis & opibus abundent, quum vitam eorum longè plu∣ribus periculis quàm pauperum, videamus esse subjectam. 185. De Porco & Equo. 1. POrcus conspiciens equum bellatorem, qui cataphractus ad pugnam prodibat; Stulte, inquit, quo properas? In pugnâ enim fortasse morieris. 2. Cui equus, Tibi inter lutum sordesque impinguato, quum nihil dignum laude gesseris, cultellus adimet vitam; mortem verò meam comitabitur gloria. 3. Mor. Haec fabula innuit, honestius esse rebus praeclare gestis oc∣cumbere, quàm vitam turpiter actam protrahere. 186. De Coriario, emente pellem ursi à Venatore nondum capti. 1. COriarius ad venatorem accedens, emit ab eo pellem ursi, pecuni∣amque pro ea protulit. 2. Ille sibi in praesentia pellem ursi non esse, caeterum postridiè venatum profeciurum; ursoque interfecto, pellem illius ei se daturum profitetu. 3. Coriarius animigratia cum venatore in sylvam profectus, altissi∣mam arborem ascendit, ut inde ursi venatorisque certamen prospiceret. 4. Venaor intrepidus ad antrum ubi ursus latebat-profectus, immis∣sis canibus illum exire compulit, qui evitato venatoris ictu, eum pro∣stravit humi. 5. Tunc venaor sciens, hanc feram in cadavera non saevire, anhelitu retento, se mortuum simulabat. 6. Ursus naribus admotis olsaciens, cùm illum nec naso, nec corde spirantem deprehenderet, abscessit. 7. Coriarius cùm feramabesse perspiceret, ac nihil amplius adesse pericui,
ex arbore se deducens, & ad venatorem, qui nondum surgere audebat, accedens, illum ut surgeret, monebat. 8. Interrogavit deinde, quid ad aurem ei ursus locutus esset; Cui Venator, Monuit me, inquit, ne deinceps ursi pellem vendere vellem, nisi eum prius ceperim. 9. Mor. Haec fabula indicat, incerta pro certis non habenda. 187. De Eremita & Milite. 1. ERemita quidam, vir sanctissimae vitae, militem hortabatur, ut relicta seculari militia, quam absque Dei offensa, & animae discrimine pauci exercent, tandem se corporis traderei quieti, & ani∣mae consuleret saluti. 2. Cui miles, Faciam, inquit, quod mones pater. 3. Verum enim est, quòd hoc tempore milites neque stipendia exi∣gere valeant, licet exigua sint, neque praedari possint. 4. Mor. Haec fabula indicat, multos vitiis renumiare, quia illa amplius exercere non possunt. 188. De Viro & Vxore bigamis. 1. VIR quidam defunctâ uxore quam valdè dilexerat, duxit alte∣ram & ipsam viduam, quae assiduè ei prioris mariti virtutes, fortiaque facinora objiciebat; cui, ut par referret, ipse quoque de∣functae uxoris mores probatissimos, pudicitiamque insignem referebat. 2. Quodam àutem die, viro irata, pauperi eleemosynam petenti, par∣tem caponis quam in coenam utriusque coxerat, dedit, dicens, Do tibi hoc pro animâ prioris viri. 3. Quod audiens maritius, accersito paupere, reliquum caponis dedit, dicens, Et ego quoque do tibi hoc pro animâ uxoris meae defunctae. 4. Sic illi, dum alteri alteri nocere cupiunt, quid coenarent tandem non habuerunt. 5. Mor. Haec fabula monet, non esse contra eos pugnandum, qui se possunt optime vindicare. 189. De Leone & Mure. 1. LEO laqueo captus in sylva cùm se ita irretitum viderit, ut nullis viribus se inde possè explicare confideret, murem rogavit, ut abroso laqueo eum liberaret, promittens tanti beneficii se non immenio∣rem futurum. 2. Quod cum mus promptè fecisset leonem rogavit, ut filiam ejus sibi traderet in uxorem. 3. Nec abnuit leo, ut benefactori suo rem gratam faceret. 4. Nova autem nupta ad virum veniens, cum eum non videret, casu illum pede pressit atque contrivit. 5. Mor. Haec indicat fabula, matrimonia, & caetera consortia impro∣banda,
quae ab imparibus contrahuntur. 190. De Ʋlmo & Silere. 1. ULmus in ripâ fluminis nata, siler sibi proximum irridebat, ut debile & invalidiem, quod ad omnem vel levissimum undarum impetum flecteretur. 2. Suam autem firmitatem & robur magnificis extollebat verbis, quod multos annos assiduos amnis impetus inconcussa perculerat. 3. Semel autem maximâ undarum violentiâ ulmus perfracta trahe∣batur ab aquis; cui siler ridens, inquit, Cur me deseris, vicina? Ʋbi est nunc fortitudo tua? 4. Mor. Haec fabula significat, sapientiores esse qui potentioribus ce∣dunt, quàm qui resistere volentes, tui piter superantur. 191. De Cera duritiem appetente. 1. CEra ingemiscebat se mollem, & cuicunque levissimo ictui pene∣trabilem procreatum. 2. Videns autem lateres ex luteo multò se molliori factos, in tantam duritiem ignis calore pervenisse, ut multa perdurarent faecula, se jecit in ignem ut tandem duritiam consequeretur. 3. Sed statim igne liquefacta consumpta est. 4. Mor. Haec admonet fabula, nè appetamus quod est nobis naturâ denegatum. 192. De Agricola, Militiam & Mercaturam affectante. 1. AGricola quidam aegrè ferebat, se assiduè terram volvere, nec perpetuis laboribus ad magnas divitias pervenire; cùm non∣nullos viderit milites, qui actis praeliis ita rem auxerant, ut bene indu∣ti incederent, & lautis epulis nutriti beatam agerent vitam. 2. Venditis igitur ovibus, capris, ac bobus, equos emit & arma, & in militiam profectus est; ubi cùm ab impratore suo male pugnatum esset, non solum quae habebat perdidit, sed etiam pluribus vulneribus affectus est. 3. Quare damnata militia mercaturam exercere statuit, ut in quâ majus lucrum & minorem laborem existimabat. 4. Praediis igitur venditis, cùm navim mercibus implevisset, navigare coeperat. 5. Sed cum in alto esset, subitâ tempestate cortâ, navis submersa est, & ipse cum caeteris qui in ea eram, ad unum omnes periere. 6. Mor. Haec fabula admonet, quemlibet debere sua sorte esse con∣tentum, cum ubique sit parata miseria. 193. De Asino & Scurra. 1. ASinus indigne ferens scurram quendam honorari & pulchris vesti∣us amiciri, quia magos ventris edebat sonos, ad magistratus accessit, petens nè se minùs quàm scurram honorari vellent.
2. Et cùm magistratus admirantes eum interrogarent, cur se ita ho∣nore dignum duceret, Quia, inquit, majores quàm scurra crepitus ven∣tris emitto, eosque absque foetore. 3. Mor. Haec fabula eos arguit, qui in rebus levissimis suas pecu∣nias profundunt. 194. De Amne, suum Fontem convitiis lacessente. 1. AMnis quidam suum Fontem convitiis lacessebat, ut intertem, quòd immobilis staret, nec ullos haberet pisces. 2. Se autem plurimum commendabat, quòd optimos crearet pisces, & per valles blando murmure serperet. 3. Indignatus fons in amnem velut ingratum, undas repressit. 4. Tunc amnis, & piscibus, & dulci sono privatus, evanuit. 5. Mor. Hac fabula eos notat, qui bona, quae agunt, sibi arrogant, non Deo attribuunt, à quo ceu à largo fonte nostra bona procedunt. 195. De Viro maligno & Daemone. 1. VIR malignus, cùm plurima perpetrasset scelera, & saepius cap∣tus, & carcere conclusus arctissimè pervigili custodia teneretur, daemonis auxilium implorabat, qui saepenumero illi affuit, & è multis eum periculis liberavit. 2. Tandem iterum deprehenso, & solitum auxilium imploranti, daemon, magnum calceorum pertusorum fascem super humeros habens, apparuit, dics, Amice, amplius tibi auxilio esse non possum 3. Tot enim loca pro te liberando hactenus peragravi, ut hos om∣nes calceos contriverim; nulla etiam mihi superest pecunia, qua alios valeam comparare. 4. Quare pereundum est tibi. 5. Mor. Haec admonet fabula, nè existimemus nostra semper im∣punita fore peccata. 196. De Avibus, plures Rege, eligere volentibus. 1. AVes consultabant de pluribus regibus eligendis, cùm aquila tan∣tos volucrum greges sola regere non posset. 2. Fecissentque voto satis nisi cornicis monitu à tali consilio destitissent. 3. Quae, cum causa rogaretur, cur non plures reges duceret e∣ligendos. 4. Quia difficilius, inquit, plures, quàm unus saccus, implentur. 5. Mor. Haec fabula docet, longe melius ab uno, quam à multis prin∣cipibus gubernari. 197. De Muliere, quae pro viro mori se velle dicebat. 1. MAtrona quaedam admodum pudica, & viri amantissima aegre ferebat marium adversâ valetudine detineri, lamentabatur, in∣gemiscebat, & ut suum in virum amorem testaretur, rogabat mortem, ut si maritum sibi esset eruptura, se potius quam illum vellet occidere.
2. Inter haec verba mortem cernit horribili aspectu venientem; cu∣jus timore perterrita, & jam sui voti poenitens, 3. Non sum ego, inquit, quem petis; jacet ibi in lecto quem occisu∣ra venisti. 4. Mor. Haec fabula indicat, neminem esse adeo amantem amici, qui non malit sibi bene esse quàm alteri. 198. De Adolescente in funere Maetris canente. 1. VIR quidam defunctam uxorem quae ad sepulhrum efferebatur, lachrymis & fletibus, prosequebatur; filius verò ejus canebat. 2. Qui cum à patre increparetur, ut amens & insanus, qui in ma∣tris funere cantaret, cum unà secum moestus esse & flere deberet, inquit. 3. Pater m, si Sacerdotes ut canerent conduxisti, cur mihi irasce∣ris, gratis concinenti? 4. Cui pater, non tuum, inquit, & sacerdotum, est idem officium. 5. Mor. Haec fabula indicat, Non omnia omnibus esse decora. 199. De Viro zelotypo, qui uxorem dederat custodiendam. 1. VIR zelotypus uxorem, quam parum pudice  compererat, cuidam amico, cui plurimum fidebat, dederat custodiendam; ingentem pollicitus pecuniam, si eam ita diligenter observaret, ut nullo modo conjugalem violaret copulam. 2. At ille, ubi aliquot dies expertus custodiam hanc nimis difficilem, & ingenium suum versutia muliris vinci comperisset, ad maritm ac∣cedens dixit, se amplius nolle hanc tam duram gerere provinciam. 3. Quandoquidem, nè Argus quidem qui totus oculatus fuit, multe∣rem invitam possit custodire. 4. Addidit praeterea, si necesse sit, malle se anno integro saccum plenum pulicibus quotidie in pratum deferre, solutoque sacco eos inter herbas pascere, vesereque facto, omnes domum reducere, quam una die impudicam mulierem servare. 5. Mor. Haec fabula indicat, nullos custodes ita esse diligentes, qui impudicas mulieres valeant custodire. 200. De Viro Clysteria recusante. 1. VIR quidam natione Germanus, dives admodum, agrotabat; ad quem curandum plures accesserunt medici (ad mel enim ca∣tervatim convolant muscae) quorum unus inter caetera dicebar, opus esse clysteribus, si vellet convalescere. 2. Quod cùm vir, hujusmodi insuetus medicinae, audiret, furore per∣citus medicos domo ejici jubet. 3. Dicens, Eos essè insanos, qui cum caput sibi doleret, podici vel∣lent mederi. 4. Mor. Haec fabula innuit, Omnia etiam salutaria, insuetis & in∣expertis, & aspera & obfutura videri.
201. De Asino aegrotante, & Lupis visitantibus. 1. ASinus aegrotabat, famaque exierat eum citò moriturum. 2. Ad eum igitur visendum cùm lupi canesque venissent, pe∣teréntque à filio, quomodo pater ejus se haberet; ille per ostii rimu∣lam respondit; Melius quam velletis. Mor. Haec indicat fabula, Quòd multi fingunt moleste serre mortem aliorum, quos tamen cupiunt celeriter interire. 202. De Nuce, Asino, & Muliere. 1. MUlier quaedam interrogabat nucem, secus viam natam, quae à praetereunte populo saxis impetebatur, quare esset ita amens, ut quòpluribus majoribusque verberibus caederetur, eò plures praestan∣tiorésque fructus procrearet? 2. Cui juglans, Esne, inquit, proverbii immemor, dicentis? Nux, Asinus, Mulier, simili sunt lege ligati: Haec tria nil recte facium, si verbera cessent. Mor. Haec fabula innuit, saepe homines propriis jaculis se solere confodere. 203. De Asino, laborum finem non inveniente. 1. ASinus hyberno tempore plurimùm angebatur, quòd nimio affi∣ceretur frigore, & durum palearum haberet victum; quare vernam temperiem, & ieneras herbas optabat. 2. Sed cum ver advenisset, cogereturque à domino, qui figulus erat, argillam in aream, & lignum ad fornacem, indeque lateres, imbrices, tegulas, ad diversa loca deferre; pertaesus veris, in quo tot labores tolerabat, aestatem omnibus votis expectabat, ut dominus, messe impeditus, eum quiescere pateretur. 3. Sed tunc quoque cum messes in arèam, & inde domum triticum ferre compelleretur, nec quieti sibi locus esset, autumnum saltem la∣borum finem fore sperabat. 4. Sed ubi ne tunc quoque malorum terminum adesse cernebat, cùm quotidie vinum, poma, ligna portanda essent, rursus hyemis nives, & glaciem efflagitabat, ut tunc saltem aliqua sibi requies à tantis labori∣bus concederetur. Mor. Haec fabula indicat, Nulla esse praesentis vitae tempora, quae non perpetuis subjecta sint laboribus.
204. De Mure, qui cum Fele amicitiam contrahere volebat. 1. MUres complures in cavo parietis commorantes, contemplaban∣tur felem, quae in tabulato, capite demisso & tristi vultu, re∣cumbebat. 2. Tunc unus ex eis, Hoc animal inquit, benignum admodum & mite videtur. 3. Vultu enim ipso sanctimoniam quandam praefert; volo ipsum allo∣qui; & cum eo indissolubilem nectere amicitiam. 4. Quae cum dixisset, & propius accessisset, à fele captus, & dila∣ceratus est. 5. Tunc caeteri hoc videntes, secum dicebant; Non est profectò, non est vultui temere credendum. Mor. Haec fabula innuit, Non ex vultu, sed ex operibus, homines judicandes; cùm sub ovina pelle saepe atroces lupi delitescant. 205. De Asino, qui Hero ingrato serviebat. 1. ASinus, qui viro cuidam ingrato multos annos inoffenso pede ser∣viebat, semel, ut fit, dum sarcina pressus esset gravi, & sate∣brosa incidens via, sub onere reciderat. 2. Tunc dominus implacabilis multis verberibus surgere compelle∣bat, pigrum animal & ignavum nuncupans. 3. At ille miser inter verbera haec secum dicebat; Infelix ego, quàm ingratum sortitus sum herum! 4. Nam quamvis ei multo tempore sine offensâ servierim, tamen non hoc unum delictum tot meis pristinis beneficiis compensat. Mor Haec fabula in eos conficta est, qui beneficiorum sibi colloca∣torum immemores, etiam minimam benefactoris sui in se offensam atro∣ci poena prosequuntur. 206. De Lupo suadente histrici, ut tela deponeret. 1. LUpus esuriens in histricem intendorat animum; quem tamen, quia sagittis undique munitus erat, invadere non audebat. 2. Excogitata autem eum perdendi astutia, illi suadere coepit, nè pacis tempore tantum telorum onus tergo reportaret. 3. Quandoquidem non aliquid sagittarii, nisi cùm praelii tempus instaret, portarent. 4. Cui histrix, Adversus lupum, inquit, semper praeliandi tempus esse credendum est. Mor. Haec fabula innuit, virum sapientem oportere, adversus ini∣micorum & hostium fraudes, semper esse munitum. 207. De Mure, liberante Milvum. 1. MUS conspicatus milvum laqueo aucupis implicitum, miseratus est avis, quamvis sibi inimicae, abrosisque dente vinculis, evolandi viam fecit.
2. Milvus tanti immemor beneficii, ubi se solutum vidit; murem nil tale suspicantem corripiens, ungnibus & rostro la∣ceravit. Mor. Fabula indicat, malignos viros hujusmodi gratias suis bene∣factoribus solere rependere. 208. De Cochlea petente à Jove, ut suam domum secum ferre posset. 1. CUM Jupiter ab exordio mundi singulis animalibus munera, quae petissent, largiretur, cochlea ab eo petiit, ut domuna suam posset circumferre. 2. Interrogata à Jove, quare tale ab eo munus exposceret, quod lli grave & molestum futurum erat; 3. Malo, inquit, tam grave onus perpetuò ferre, quàm, cùm mihi ibuerit, malum vicinum non posse vitare. Mor. Fabula indicat, Malorum vicinitatem omni commodo fugiendam. 209. De Herinaceo, Viperam hospitem ejiciente. 1. HErinaceus hyemem adventare praesentiens, blandè viperam ro∣gavit, ut in propriâ illius cavernâ adversus vim frigoris locum sibi concederet. 2. Quòd cum illa fecisset, herinaceus huc atque illuc se pervol∣vens, spinarum acumine viperam pungebat, & vehementi dolore tor∣uebat. 3. Illa male secum actum videns, quando herinaceum suscepit ho∣spitio, blandis eum verbis, ut exiret, orabat; quandoquidem locus du∣bus esset nimis angustus. 4. Cui Herinaceus, Exeat, inquit, qui hîc manere non potest. 5. Quare Vipera, sentiens sibi locum ibi non esse, illinc cessit ho∣spitio. Mor. Fabula indicat, eos in consortia non admittendos, qui nos pos∣sunt ejicere. 210. De Agricolâ quodam, & Poetâ. 1. AGricola quidam ad Poetam accedens, cujus agros colebat, cùm eum inter libros solum offendisset, interrogavit eum, quo acto ita solus vivere posset. 2. Cui ille, Solus, inquit, tantùm esse coepi, postquam te huc con∣tulisti. Mor. Haec indicat Fabula, Bruditos viros, qui doctissimorum viro∣um turba continuè stipantur, tunc solos esse, cùm inter illitertos ho∣mines fuerint.
211. De Lupo Ovis pelle induto, qui gregem devorabat. 1. LUpus, ovis pelle indutus, ovium se immiscuit gregi, quotidie∣que aliquam ex eis occidebat; quod cùm pastor animadver∣tisset, illum in altissimâ arbore suspendit. 2. Interrogantibus autem caeteris pastoribus, cur ovem suspendis∣set, aiebat; 3. Pellis quidem, ut videtis, est ovis; opera autem erant lupi. Mor. Haec indicat fabula, Homines non ex habitu, sed ex operi∣bus judicandos, quoniam multi sub vestimentis ovium, lupina faciunt opera. 212. De Patre, Filium ad virtutes frustrà hortante. 1. PAter quidam filium, ut vitiis deditum, multis hortabatur ver∣bis, ut, derelicta vitiorum via, virtutibus invigilares, quae ei laudem & decus erat pariturae. 2. Cui filius, Frustra, inquit, pater, ad haec facienda hortaris. 3. Multos enim praedicatores, ut aiunt, audivi, qui longe te meli∣us ad virtutum hortabantur viam, nunquam tamen eorum admoniti∣onibus obsecutus sum. Mor. Haec fabula indicat, Virs malignae naturae nullius hortatu à viiis velle discedere. 213. De Cane, Oves Domini sui occidente, à quo suspensus est. 1. PAstor quidam cani oves suas dederat custodiendas, optimis illum pascens cibis. 2. At ille faepe aliquam ovem occidebat. 3. Quod cùm pastor animadvertisset, canem capiens, eam volebat occidere. 3. Cui canis, Quid me, inquit, perdere cupis? Sum unus ex do∣mesticis tuis; intersice potius lupum, qui continuò tuo infidiatur ovili. 5. Imò, inquit Pastor, Te quam lupum morte dignum magis puto. 6. Ille enim palàm se meum hostem profitetur; tu verò sub amici∣tiae specie quotidie meum imminuis gregem. Mor. Haec innuit fabula, longè magis puniendos, qui sub amicitiae specie nos laedunt, quàm qui apertè se nostros inimicos profitentur. 214. De Ariete, cum Tauro pugnante? 1. ARies quidam inter lanigeros greges erat tanta cornuum & capi∣tis firmitate, ut caeteros arietes statim faciléque superaret. 2. Quare cum nullum ampliùs arietem inveniret, qui occursanti sibi auderet obsistere, Crebris elatus victoriis, taurum ausus est ad certa∣men provocare. 3. Sed primo congressu, cùm in taurinam frontem arietasset, tam a∣troci ictu repercussus est, ut fere moriens haec diceret;

VIdua quaedam coelibatum exosa, nubere cupiebat; sed non aude∣bat, verita vulgi irrisiones, qui maledictis eas solent incessere, quae ad secundas transeunt nuptias. 2. Sed Commater ejus, quàm contemnendae essent populi voces, hac arte monstravit. 3. Jussit enim asinum album, quem vidua habebat, viridi colore depingi, & per omnes urbis vicos circumduci. 4. Quod dum fieret, tanta admiratio ab initio omnes invaserat, ut non solum pueri, verùm etiam senes hac re insolita moti, asinum ani∣mi gratiâ comitarentur. 5. Deinde cùm hujusmodi animal quotidiè per urbem duceretur, desierunt admirari. 6. Itidem, inquit ad viduam commater, eveniet tibi. 7.

At illa eum ut pusillum, & terrestre animal, & ad sibi nocen∣dum impotens arbitrata, eos in conspectu matris unguibus dilacerare, & pullis suis epulandos opponere, non dubitavit. 3. Tunc cuniculus, filiorum morte commotus, hanc injuriam mi∣nimè impunitam abire permisit. 4. Arborem enim, quae nidum sustinebat radicitus effodit; quae le∣vi impulsu ventorum procidens, pullos aquilae adhuc implumes & in∣volucres in humum dejecit; qui à feris depasti magnum doloris sola∣latium cuniculo praebuerunt.

Unde cuncti eum admirabantur, & tanquam regem, praecipuo prosequebantur honore.
3. Quare in superbiam elatus, majorem principatum coepit ap∣petere. 4. Relicto igitur amne, in quo multos annos regnaverat, ingressus est mare, ut ejus regnum sibi vindicaret. 5. Sed offendens Delphinum mirae magnitudinis, qui in illo regna∣bat, ita ab illo insectatus est, ut aufugiens vix amnis ostium ingredere∣tur; unde ampliùs non ausus est exire. Mor.

Ecquid, inquit ovis, pejus mihi facere potes? 4. Ut te, inquit pastor, occidam, & lupis canibusque projiciam devorandam. 5. Siluit ovis, majora adhuc mala formidans. Mor. Haec fabula indicat, non debere homines in Deum excandes∣cere, si divitias & filios ipsis permittat auferri; cum etiam majora & viventibus & mortuis possit inferre supplicia. 219. De Aurigâ, & Ritâ currûs stridente. 1. AUriga interrogabat currum, quare rota, quae erat deterior, strideret; cùm caeterae idem non facerent. 2.

De Viro, amicos experire volente. 1 VIR quidam dives admodum & liberalis, magnam habebat ami∣corum copiam, quos ad coenam saepissimè invitabat, ad quam libentissimè accedebant. 2. Volens autem experiri, an in laboribus & periculis sibi fideles essent, omnes pariter convocavit, dicens obortos sibi inimicos, ad quos perdendos ire statuerat. 3. Quare correptis armis secum irent, ut illatas sibi ulcisceretur in∣jurias. 4. Tum omnes, praeter duos, sese excusare coeperunt. 5. Caeteris igitur repudiatis, illos tantùm duos in amicorum nume∣ro habuit, quos deinde singulari amore prosecutus est. Mor. Haec fabula indicat, Adversam fortunam amicitiae experimen∣tum esse quam optimum.
221. De Vulpe, carnem Leporis Cani laudante. 1. VUlpes cùm fugaretur à cane, & jamjam esset capienda, nec ullam aliam evadendi viam invenire se posse cognosceret: Quid me, inquit, ô canis, perdere cupis, cujus caro tibi usui esse non potest? 2. Cape potiùs leporem illum (non procul enim lepus aberat) cu∣jus carnem suavissimam mortales esse commemorant. 3. Canis igitur motus consilio vulpis, omissâ vulpe, leporem in∣secuus est, quem tamen ob incredibilem ejus velocitatem capere non potuit. 4. Paucis post diebus lepus conveniens vulpem, vehementer eam ac∣cusabat (verba enim ejus audierat) quòd se cani demonstrâsset. 5. Cui vulpes; Quid me accusas, lepus, quum tantopere te lau∣davi? Quid diceres, si te vituperassem? Mor. Haec fabula indicat, multos mortales sub laudationis specie aliis perniciem machinari. 222. De Lepore calliditatem, & Vulpe celeritatem à Jove petentibus. 1. LEpus & Vulpes à Jove petebant, haec, ut calliditati suae pedum celeritatem; ille, ut velocitati suae calliditatem adjungeret. 2. Quibus Jupiter ita respondit; Ab origine mundi è sinu nostro liberalissimo singulis animantibus sua munera sumus elargiti. 3. Ʋni autem omnia dedisse allorum fuisset injuria. Mor. Haec indicat fabula, Deum singulis sua munera, ita esse aequa∣li lance largitum, ut quisque esse debeat sua sorte contentus. 223. De Equo inculto, sed veloci; & caeteris eum irridentibus. 1. EQui complures ad Circenses ludos fuerant adducti, pulcherri∣rimis phalaris ornati, praeter unum quem caeteri incultum, & ad hujusmodi certamen ineptum irridebant, nec unquam victorem fu∣turum opinabantur. 2. Sed ubi currendi tempus advenit, & dato tubae signo cuncti car∣ceribus exiluere, tum demum innotuit, quantò hic paulò ante irrisus caeteros velocitate superaret. 3. Omnibus enim aliis post se longo intervallo relictis palmam asse∣cutus est. Mor. Fabula significat, non ex habitu, sed ex virtute, homines ju∣dicandos. 224. De Rustico, per vocem hoedi, ad Juriscon∣sultum admisso. 1. RUsticus quidam, gravi lite implicitus, ad quendam Jurisconsul∣tum accesserat, ut eo patrono sese explicaret. 2. At ille aliis negotiis impeditus, renuntiari jubet, se non posse nunc illi vacare: quare abiret, alias rediturus.
3. Rusticus, qui huic ut veteri fidoque amico plurimum fidebat, sae∣pius rediens, nunquam admissus est. 4. Tandem hoedum adhuc lactantem & pinguem secum deferens, nte aedes jurisperiti stabat, & hoedum vellicans, illum balare cogebat. 5. Janitor, qui ex praecepto heri, dona portantes admittere so∣ebat, auditâ hoedi voce, januam illicò aperiens, hominem introire ubet. 6.

Sed cùm incassum verba funderet, juvene ejus aetatem ac verba contemnente, Non in verbis tantùm, inquit, verùm etiam in herbis udio esse virtutem. 3. Herbas igitur vellere, & in illum jacere coepit. 4. Quod juvenis conspicatus, in vehementem risum effusus est, & se∣nem delirare arbitrabatur, qui crederet eum ex arbore herbis posse depellere. 5. Tunc senex omnia experiri cupiens, Quando, inquit, verborum & herbarum vires adversus raptorem mearum rerum nullae sunt, la∣pidibus agam, in quibus quoque dicunt esse virtutem. 6. Lapidesque quibus gremium impleverat, in juvenem jaciens, llum descendere & abire coëgit. Mor. Haec fabula indicat, Omnia prius sapienti tentanda, quam ad armorum confugiatur auxilium. 226.
