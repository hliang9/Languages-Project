Doubtful ROBIN; Or, Constant NANNY. A New BALLAD. Tune of, Wou'd you be a man of Fashion, or, Doubting Virgin. DEarest Nanny prithee tell me, be so just as tell me true What hard fate was that befell me to be slighted so by you: I that thought your vows so lasting did imagine no deceit, But I find all your protesting to be nothing but a cheat. But I find &c. Tell me then thou faithless woman why thou dost so ill with me, Thou that did protest that no man ever was so dear to thee: Tho' in vain I should perswade thee once thy promise to renew, Yet I pitty to upbraid thee that thou art so much untrue. Yet &c. Her Answer. Dearest Robin pray believe me, from my heart I freely speak, I did never yet deceive thee, nor my vows will never break; I did alwaies love you dearly, and no other man but you, My poor heart does shew it clearly, that I never was untrue. My poor heart &c. Tell me pray why you are frighted that I should unconstant prove, Or to think that you are slighted, or the least suspect my love; Tell me pray that I may mend it, if that any cause be due; I am sure I can defend it, for I never was untrue. I am sure &c. Take this kiss and take my heart too if that will confirm my dear, if you think I do not smart too, will you then believe this tear: Iealousie ind√©ed may wrong us, and our sorrows may renew, if your fears bring that among us, 'tis in vain for to be true. If your fears &c, Yet my dearest ne'r shall find it that I e're will prove unkind, For I never yet design'd it ever for to change my mind; Since you once believ'd I lov'd you, know I still shall do so too, Let no jealous fancy move you for to think I am untrue. Let no jealous &c. Dearest Nanny i'le believe thee, And reserve thee to my heart, For my jealous thoughts forgive me and we never more will past: All the day I will embrace thee, to my fears i'le bid adieu, VVhen at night I shall unlace thee, thou shalt say that I am true. When at night &c. But I hope that we are friends too, now thy patience I have try'd: This i'le do for thy amends too whensoe're you are my Bride, There's my heart & there's my hand too, to all sorrows bid adieu, All I have you shall command too, since I find that you are true. All I have &c. So they seal'd up their indentures with a loving kiss or two, Married straight at all adventures, never Couple lov'd so true; So I wish they may persevere in this happy way of life, Then true cause she will have never to repent she was a wife. Then true cause &c. Printed for P. Brooksby at the golden ball in Py-Corner.
