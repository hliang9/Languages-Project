A supplicacyō to the quenes maiestie. Impryntid at London / by Iohn Cawoode Prynter tho the quenes Mayestie wyth here most gra∣cyns lycence.
A supplicacyon IN Moste humble wise Cō∣playnyth vnto your highnes / that wher as this noble realm off Eng∣land / hath of long tyme out of mynd bene the most fre contre in all Christē¦dome / Now is lyke to be brought in to bōdag and slauery of such a nacy∣on as  the world both hatyth and abhoryth. The only accasion ther off is our vnthākfulnes / as our preachers ād true prophetes declarid vnto vs in the tyme off your brother / that most vertues prynce king Edward the vj.King Ed∣uord. That yff we wold not be thankful for that great benyfyte off godes holy worde / then truly preachyd among vs. God wold take away our sayd vertues king / and set vp a strang king to raygne ouer vs / for our vnrepen∣tant hartes / who shuld bring it,A strange King agayn / popery / ydolatry / and all abhomynacyons / as it is com to passe this day. For when that blessyd word off god was truly preachyd among vs / we folowyd it not in lyvyng / but dyd as the Iwes whych folo∣wyd christ / becawse thy eat off hys bread and were fyllyd.Ioā. 6. Euen so dyd the most part off euery state and degre in the comō Weal / hear the gospel prea∣chyd not because they sought the glory off god on∣ly / and so to haue framyd them selues to lyue ther after / as they owgh to do. But lyuyd as in the ty∣me off ther former darknes / in euell lust / vsyng ex∣torcyon couetusnes / and brybery? Nether sowgh they the true lyberty off the gospel / to set ther cons∣ciēces fre frō syū ād supersticiō. Which now (alas)
apperyth by ther so redy mutabylyte / prouoking godds heuy Ire and wrath wyth ther seinyng to alowe Idolatry: which Passyth all the former e∣uel. So that it is to be drad / godes Iustes doth ponysfhe one synn by another / which off al is most perelouse / and dangeruse / as appe ryth by them which be geuē vp off god / becawse they seke not to gloryfye god / accordyng to the knowledg he hath offryd vnto thē but Wanndryng in the vanyties off ther own reasons / and ymagynacyon off ther own hartes:Roma. 1 become at last to be confyrmid in er∣rour wyth strong illusyons / becawse they haue had no more ernest desyre to the truth / as the holy appostle doth most playnly declare.2 thessa. 2. 1.

Cro. 36 On the other syde / some were wylful / stubburn ād herd hartyd / and wold not receyne the gospel off the glory off god / but wyth desyre to ther old ydolatry / haste∣nyd the vegeance off god. And therfore are thes plages Iustly com vpon vs becawse off our vn∣thankfulnes / and not knowyng the tyme off our ysytacyon. For godes holy boke doth shew thes / o be the very ād in fallyble causes off the ouerthro¦we of kingdomes ād comō weales / specyally wher god off his mercy / hath offryd the knowledg off ym selff / and cawsyd hys worde to be truly prea∣hyd. Wherfore your grace may call to remembran∣ce the great and manyfold benyfytes that ye haue eceyuyd at the handes of allmyghty god / who by ys permissyō hath so quyetly sett you in your esta∣e and honour that ye be in at this tyme / and hath
also contrary to mens expectacyon geuē you frute in your body / as it is reportyd. And according to serteyne off your preuy cunsell setting forth to the world in print / wyth ther hands at it / and as the acte off perlyament doth pronunce and declare / prouydyng for the same. besydes many other gyff∣tes he hath indwed you wyth all. Wherfore looke to betymes / least ye be founde vnthankfull for all those benyfytes that god off hys mercy so rychly hath pouryd apon you / now that you see those pla∣ges Iustly com apon the realm / that god plagyd other realmes wyth all for ther vnthankfulnes. We haue a notable example off the Iwes / who were gods elect ād chosen people whom god with A myghty hand delyueryd out of the bondage of Egypt brought them thorow the red see / fede th wyth heuenlye bread xl yeres in the wyldernes / gaue them in possessyō many kingdomes / ād dro∣ue out many nacyons before them / so that quyetly they enioyed ther contres and domynyons.A notable example. And for all those benyfytes / god requyryd no more of thē but to loue hym wyth all ther hartes / ād to kepe hys commandments / and in no wyse to serue any strang godes made off syluer or gold wood o stone et c. lyke as the nacyons had done / whō god cast out before them for the same offencys. This notwythstondyng / they forgate god that had do∣ne so many benyfytes for thē / ād worshypyd strāg gods / lyke as the hethen dyd. then god sent vnto thē hys holy prophetes to warn thē to forsake ther abhominable ydolatrie / but they wold not obay
goddes holy prophetes but murtheryd them as playnly apperyth (lyke as our bysshopes will mur∣ther gods true preachers ād prophets now adays which haue preachid the lyke message of god) but what folowid for ther vnthākfulnes / dyd not god plage them by sending strāgers amōg thē / whych dystroyed many hūdryd thousands in ther former tymes off ther captyuytes and changes off ther comon weale / and at the last vtter dyssolucyon:Note. namely at the destruccyon off Ierusalem / by Titus and Vespacianus the emprours / and also dystro∣yed ther gooly cytes / caryed them out off ther own contres / wher they be now scateryd abrode / made flaues / dyspysyd / and abhorryd off all nacyons as it is manifest and playne at this day.Titus ād Vespaci∣anus Example. This is a goodly example for your grace and for all chysten prynces to marke ād to haue all wayse before your eyes / least ye and they be found vnthankful: And know ye this suerly / that yff god sparyd not the Iwes / which were hys elect and chosen people / mych lesse wyll he spare you / yff ye anger hym with strange worshyppyng ād seruyng of strāge gods / and settyng vp habomynacyons / lyke as they dyd. I haue hard many tymes that ye do it off a zeal that ye haue to Relygyō / yea but your zeal is not ac¦cordyng to knowledg of gods holy worde / for god did forbid his people / the chyldern of Israel to do that they thought good in ther own eyes: but wyl∣yd them to do that only which he comādyd them.Nadab ād abiuu Leuyti. 10. Aadab and Abyw the sonnes off Aaroy / offryd strang fyre before the lord that he comandyd them
not / ād therfor were cōsumyd wyth the same fyre. Likwise king Saul cōtrary to gods comandmēt / off a good intent reseruyd sartein off the best off the oxen and shepe / (as he sayd) to do sacryfyce to the lord / what folowyd off it?King saul 1. Samu. 15 was he not therfore deposid from his Kingdom. This is also a goodly exāple for your grace to marke / ād to beware how ye enterpryse to do things off a good intēt / hauing no warrentyse of gods reuelyd will in hys worde / but his word manifestly agaynst you. Your grace therfore before ye ha done any thyng in the chaung off relygyon / owght fyrst to haue known yff gods worde wold haue permittyd you / as in the first cō∣uocaciō / ye began well to haue had the matter opē¦ly dysputyd:Conuo∣cacion. but the more pyte / the thing was not indyfferētly hādlyd / for the cheff off the lernid men being maryed according to the lawes both of god and also off the realm / cold not be suffryd the same time to dispute / and yet those few lernid mē which were ther vnmaried / were nor indifferentlie herd / but things procedid clene cōtrary to that / those fe∣we prouid by good lernīg / as all mē that were ther present can testefye. A lamētable case / that gods worde / hys trwe relygyon / and hys mynysters / must be so condempnyd / not being indyfferently herd?Note but no great meruayle / for christ hym selff / and all his appostells ād prophetes / were so herd / and so condempnyd: and the lyke hath comonly bene vsyd sens the world began. For euer more the wyckyd persecutyd the good and godly: as kayn persecutyd hys brother Abell euen to the death / and Esawe persecutyd hys bro∣ther
Iacob / and euer the false Prophetts / and Prestes / haue persecutyd the trwe Prophetts and Preachers off god to death.Genes. 4. Kayn. Abell. Esau and Iacob. Gen. 27. A nota∣ble exam∣ple. And here off we haue a notable example in the scrypture / the which I wold desyre your grace to read / and to marke the same well. In the / 22. chapter off the thyrd book off Kings / when king Achab was go∣ing to warr agaynst the Syryans / he callyd for all hys prophets / to know of them whether he should go to warr or not / and hys false prophets cōselyd hym to go / sayeng that he should prosper agaynst them. And when only gods true prophet in deed / was callyd / the prophet Micheas / he sayeng the truth / contrary to the great nomber off the false prophets which were in nomber / 400 / was smyt∣ten therfore / which was his reward. Then he sayd here the worde off the lord / I saw the lord sitt on his seat / ād all the host of heauē stood about hym / on his right hand and on hys left. And he sa¦yd who schall perswade King Achab that he may go to warr / and fall before hys henemyse / ād ther came forth a serteine spiryt ād stode before the lord / and sayd I wyll perswade hym:Micheas the pro∣phet and the lord sayd to him wher with / and he sayd I wyll go out and be a false spirite in the mouth of his prophets / and he said thou shalt perswade hym / go forth thē and do euē so: And the prophet Micheas sayd be∣hold the lord hath put a lyeng spryte in the mouth off all thes thy prophets &c. And for hys sayeng the truth he was smytten and cast in pryson / and king Achab folouing the coūsel of hys great nom∣ber
off false prophets / wēt to the warres and was slayne. And here may your grace see also / that the truth standyth not in the multytude and nomber.☞ This example I wold desyre your grace to marke well / and geue not so mych credence / to your false bysshoppys and clergye / which wyth ther lyes de∣ceyuyrh you (as that multytude off false prophets deceiuyd King Achab 10 hys dyscructyon) ād caw sith the trwe preachers and prophets / which haue preachyd gots worde truly to be put in preson / ād yff your grace help them not / they wyll murther ād distroy thē / lyke as ther predysessors haue alw∣ais done. And here I may specyaly make mēciō to your grace of that crtwes ād lernid mā Thomas Cramner Archbisshop of Cāterbury / who hath sa∣uid your graces liff / and put him self in Ieoperdi for your graces cawse / as it is wel known Bisome off hys enemise / that were off Kinge Edwards con̄sell and I doubt not but that your grace kno∣with of it / and therfore I trust your grace will re∣quite him with merci / and not suffer that wickid bisshope off winchester / to haue his wicked will and purpose off him. We read also in the 18. chapter off the third bo∣oke off the kings / affter that allmighty god at the praier off the prophet Elias / had shut the heuens that it rainid not in thre yeres and six monithes / and king Achab meting with the prophet Elias / he sayd to him?. Reg. 18. Elias thou art he that troblest all Israel (like as steuē gardener bisshop off winchester and his feloues / saith to the pour preachers and pro∣fessors
of Christes gospell now a days) but Elias words shall answere hym / wherwith he answerid king Achab. It is he and hys cōplices / that haue forsakē the liuing god / and do go a whoring after strang gods / as the matter shall plainly appere when god will / like as it did appere by Elias / with the 400.Quene Iesabell. false prophets / which false prophetts had seducid the quene Iesabell / and had cawsid her to sley and distroy all gods holy prophetts (like as our false and cruell bisshopps intendith to do) so that the prophet Elias was fain to fly in to the wil dernes / to saue his liff / wher god appointid A Ra¦uen to feed hym? but what was the ende both of the quene and of all those false prophetts / Read the text / and you shal plainly perceiue that the que¦ne was cast down out of a window wher she bra∣ke her neke ād was eatē vp of dogs / as the prophet of god had before said / and all here false prophetts and preastes were vtterly distroied. Lett this greuous example moue your grace do beware be tymes of your false bysshopps and cler∣gye / specyally of steuen gardener bysshop of wyn∣chester / who now this thyrd tyme hath recātyd as your grace knowyth:Steuen gardener. first he sware to the pope but by all lyklyhode he played the fox / and faynyd hym selff to be a flepe / or dremyd when he so dyd / after that ē sware to your noble father K. . 8. and mo¦re playnly declaryd the same by hys bocke / devera obedientia.Vera obe∣diencia. Which was made of hym wyth great aduysement and delyberacyon / as apperyth here
after by bisshope bonner / in hys prolog to the same booke. Here I wold make a supplycacyon to your grace / besechyng you for our saueyour Iesus Chri∣stes sake / that you wyll wyth good delyberacyon / cawse to be read before you / the sayd booke which he namyd the trwe obedyence / yf it please your gra¦ce at my humble request / so to do / as your dwtye is before god:Request. you shall playnly perceyne wyth what scrypture and reasons / he throughly cōfutyth the vsurpyd pour and auctoryte of the bysshopp of Ro¦me / and in hys booke that he made agaynst the hū¦ryng of the fox lykewyse. And in the same booke de¦vera obedientia (for to flatter your noble father) he doth therin proue the maryage betwene hym. And your mother quene kateryne / not to be good nor lawfull / to your great repoch and slāder / as mych als in hym laye / fforthes be hys wordes. To make mencyon of certeine of the morall preceptes / (for I mind not to reherse all) which be in the old law a conserning mariages which befor bidden / and mariages which be incestius / those preceptes which be comandid / and pertein to cha∣stite and purite of mariages / wherin is conteinid the hole course of mans liff / and the beginning of the bringing forth of Issue consistith:Note.

voice of nature / and gods comandment agreing in one / haue forbiddē that which should be diffe∣ring for ether of them. but among thes perceptes / seing that comandment is cōteinid / which is that the brother shold not mary the brothers wiff:The bro∣ther may not mary hys bro∣thers vvif What other thing owght or cold the kings most excelēt Maiestie do / then that he hath done / with the full consent of the people / and with the Iudge¦ment of his church / that benig deuorsid from vn∣lawfull bonds (or cōuenants) to enioie laufull and permirrid copulacion / and obeieng to the prece∣pres (as it was mete) to leue herre which nether law nor right did permitt to kepe / and to geue him selff to chast and lawfull matrymonye.Vnlau∣full bōds.

HEre before I haue discribid to your grace / two of your false and dissembling bisshops / to say steuē gardener bisshop of winchester / ād Edmond Bon̄er bisshop of Londō.Note thre dissem∣bling bis∣shops, to say vvin∣chester lō∣don and durram. the third is dreming Tū∣stall bisshop of Durram / as plainlie aperith by his booke of the sermō that he made before your noble father K.H.8. on palm sonday. 1539. Wherin he al¦so clerli cōfutith / the vsurpid pouer of the bisshops of Romes auctoryte / and here I wil make rehersal of perte of hys sermon worde for worde as he caw sid it to be printid / which be these. What shall we saie of those whom god hath cre∣atid to be subiectes / coman̄ding them by hys worde / to obey princes and gouerners?Read in the leaues B. and E. of the bo¦oke of his sermō. who not only do refuse to obey gods comādment / but con∣trary to hys worde / wilbe aboue ther gouernours / in refusing to obey thē / ād further more will haue ther princes prostrat apon the grūd / to whom they owe subiection / to Adore them by godly honoure vpon the earth / and to kisse ther fete / as yf they we∣re god / wher they be but wrechyd men / ād yet they looke that ther princes should do it to them / and also al other Christen men / owing them no subiec∣tion / shold of dutie do the same. Do not thes as ye thinke folowe the pride of lucifir ther father?Note that the bisshops of Rome becompa¦ryd to lu¦cyfire. who make them selues fellous to god contrary to hys worde. but who I pray you be thes / that mē may know them? surely the bisshops of Rome be those / whom I do meane. Who do exalt ther seat aboue the sterres of god / ād do assende aboue the cludes and wilbe like to all mighty god.

Arrant traytor.And the bisshopp of Rome now of late / to sett forth his pestilēt malis the more hath alurid to his purpose a subiecte of this Realm Rainold pole / co men of a noble bloude / and therby the more arrant traitoure / to go about from prince to prince / and from cōtry to cōtry to styre thē to warr against this Realme / and to distroy the same / being his natiue countre. Whose pestilent purpose / albe it the prin∣ces that he brake it vnto / haue in mich abhomina∣ciō / both for that the bisshope of Rome (who being a bisshop should procure peace) is a stirere of warr and becawse this most arrāt and vnkind traytour re / is his minister / to so deuelishe a purpose / to di∣stroy the countre / that he was borne in:Tunstals iudgmēt of Cardi¦nal Pole. which any heathen man wold abhore to do / but for all that with out shame he still goith one / exorting ther vnto all princes that will here him. Who do ab∣horr to see such vnnaturalnes in any man / as he shamlesse doth sett forwardes / whose pernicious treasons / late secretly wrought against this realm☞ haue bene by the worke of allmighthye God / so meruclusly detectid / ād by his owne brother with out loking therfore / so disclosid / and condingne po¦nischmēt enswid / that hereafter god willing / they shall not take any more such Rote / to the noyance of this Realme.Note that Car¦dinal Po¦le is vvors then a pa¦gant. And wher ac all nacions of gen¦tils / by reason and by law of nature / do preferre ther countre / before ther parents / so that for ther countre / they will die against ther parents beinge traitors / this pestilent man worse then a pagant / is not asshamid to distroie yf he could his natine
confitre. And wheras Curtius a hethen man / was content / fo: sauing of the cite of Rome / wher he was Borne / to leape in to a gaping earth / which by the yllusions of the deuell / it was answerid should not be shute / but that it must first haue one.Note that Car∣dinall po¦le, is mo¦re vvyld ād cruell, then ani¦tygure. This pernicius man is contente to rune hedling in to hell / so that therby he may distroie his natyue con¦tre of England / being in that behalff incompari∣son worse then any pagant. And besids his pesti∣lēt treason / his vnkindnes against the kings Ma∣iestie / wo brought him vp of a child and promotid both him / and restorid his bloude being attaintid / to be of the peres of this realme / and gaue him mo¦ny yerly out of his coffers / to find hym honorably at studie / makith his treason mich more detestable to all the world / and hym to be reputid more wild and cruell then any Tigure.Also no¦tetha the Realm of Englād is geuen to the ge¦neration of ēglishe mē, and not to spā¦nierds. But for all this thou englishe mā / take good corage vnto the / thou hast god on thy side / who hath geuen this realme to the generacion of Englishmen / to euery man in his degre / after the lawes of the same / thou hast A noble victorius ād vertues king / hardy as alyō / who will not suffer the to be so deuourid / by such wild beastes: only take En anglishe hart vnto the / and mistrust not god but trust firmlie in him.Vvhat make ye of the quē thē that re¦ceuith the pope aga in contra¦ry to here fathers doings in his ti¦me.

All this with mich more / be the very wordes of

And also against Cardinal Po¦le / calling hym errant traitore and worse then a pa¦gant / as before is rehersid / for his vnnaturallnes against his own countre / which god hath geuen

Lord Cob¦ham. was ther not many felds fowght within this realm / wher were slaine allmost all the noble and gentill men / besides ma∣ny thousands of the comōs / as our own cronicles plainli declarith? was not the clergie al the hole oc¦casiō of this / first by puttig downe that good king Richard the second and setting vp.

Thys were a notable exāple and / lesson for your clergie / to make them beware how they / persecute Christ in hys power members / but I fear me god hath hardenid ther hartes / as he dyd the vnhap∣py pashure ād hys felous / ād as he dyd the hert of king Pharoe who for all the miracles and woun∣ders / that god wrought before him by the hands of moses and Aaron / wold not suffer the children of Israell gods electe people / to go out of hys coū∣tre / but plagid them the more / but what was hys rewarde / was not he with all hys hoste drownyd in the rede see?An exam¦ple for the clergye yf they had any grace or feare of god Iere. 38. exody. 7.8.9.10. Euen so what folowid all the per∣secuciōs and wickid laws that they made / to kepe gods verite vnder foote / what helpid it them / did it not still the more florishe ād Increase? And did not your noble father / in the perliament holden in the 25 yere of hys reigne / at the supplicaciō of the

That is to say? becawse the ordinarie by vertue off that wickide lawe / might as they dyd opon ther suggestion / arest or Impryson any persone or persons / whom they thought defamid or suspecte of heresie / and them to kepe in ther prisons / tyll they were purgid ther¦of / or abiurid / or comittid to the lay poure to be bur¦nid / and yet in no parte of the same wickide laws be declarid any serteigne cases of heresie / so that the most experte ād best lernid men of the realme / diligently lieng in waite / vpon hym selff / can not auoyde or esthwe / the penaltie of the sayd act / yf he should be examinid epon such captius interogati∣ons / as it hath bē accustomid to be ministrid bithe ordinaris of this Realme / in cases wher they will suspecte any persō of heresye: And ouer this for∣asmich as it stondith not wyth the right order of Iustice nor good equite that any person shold be conuicte or put to losse of hys lyff / good name or goods / onlesse he were by dwe occasion and wit∣nes or by persentment / verdite / confession / or pro∣cesse of outlarye &c.The very vvords of the statu∣de an̄o 25. H.8. Wherfore it is not reasonable that any ordinarie / by any suspection conceiuid of hys own fātasie / whith out dwe accusacion or pre¦sentment / shold put any subiecte of thys Realme in any infamy or slander of heresy / to the perell of lyff / lose of name or goods &c.Slander of heresy. Thys with mich mo¦re is declarid in the said statude of 25. H.8. Which
was the occasion that the said most wickid lawe of ex officio / was broken. More ouer your said noble father perceiuid how many honest men in his tyme / were distroied and murtherid by his said clergie / as Iohā hune / and many other honest men / which liuid both quietlye and honestlie among ther neibours / this is so plai¦ne that they are not able to deny it.Iohāhume wherfore I most humbly besech your grace to consider thes things / for it is not ynough for your grace to geue ouer your pour and auctorite / to your wickid bis∣shoppes and clergie / and so thinke to charge them and to discharge your selff / nay not so? for euery one shall beare hys own burthen as the holy ap∣postle pronouncith / and as gardener saith in hys booke de vera obediencia likewise / god hath sett you in auctorite / and it is you your selff that shall geue an accompt to a Iudge that is aboue you / whose seat is the heauen / and the earth is hys foot stole / the which by his holy worde made all thīgs / and by the same worde shall distroye all Antichri∣stes / which sekith the distruction of hys kingdom / who dwellith in the light that no man can attai∣ne / whom no man hath seen nor can see to him on∣ly be geuen all honoure and glory for euer more. FƲrthermore may it please you to knowe that themprour and diuers other princes and ma¦gistrates / haue for the paiment of a litle monie / suf¦frid ād doth suffer the wickid Iwes ād also the cur¦sid turkes / to dwell sauely in ther cōtres ād Cities / The Iues and turks

Cor. 14. Now to make an ende of this my supplicacion / I haue read a godly example of the conuercion of s. Paule / who being brought vp ffrom his youth at the feete of Gamaliell / being a pharise / of a zeale that he hade to mainteine the pharcisey call doctri∣ne of the pharises became also apersecutor with the pharisies for a space / which pharises / had wholie coruptid the law of god geuen by Moses.Antichris∣tians. Actes. 9. And as they had aduaunsid ther own tradicions / deuisid by therrabbins / which both Christ and hys appost¦les / comonly rebukid tawght and preachid ther against / and therfore they slawndrid hym and hys apostles and neuer left persecuting of thē / till they had murtherid them: Euen so our trwe preachers in thes days / which haue preachid against the abu¦se both of prayeng / fasting / and also of allmose dedes (like as Christ hym selff dyd) our bisshopes persecute to the death / falsly belieng them / saieng / that they preachid against prayer / fasting / and all∣mose deades &c. when they dyd preach / but only
against the supersticious abuse / as ther maister Christ did / which preachid against the abuse ther off / but the seruant is not aboue hys maister and lorde / for yf they haue callid the lord of the howse / helsebub / how mich more shall they call hys how∣sold seruants. Also like as the scrybes ād pharises / falsely belyed and slaunderid our saue your Christ / euē so do our bisshoppes and clergie / belye and sla¦under our trwe preachers and prophetes of gods holy worde / when they preach not against the sa∣craments and ceremonis / but against ydolatrie co¦untid a sacramēt and the abuse of the ceremonies: ffor to wryte of the abuse of the sacraments and ce∣monies a greate booke wold scarsely suffice / and therfo: I will turne againe to my matter of the cō∣uercion of s. Paule / who (as I haue said / of a zea¦le that he had to the doctrine of the pharises / perse∣cutid Christes poure members / and cawsid many to be bound and cast in to pryson.Phillip. 3. Act. 9. Galla. 1. 1. Timo 1. 1. Cor. 15. But becawse he did it ygnorantly / he obtainid mercy as he hym¦selff confessed / not being worthy to be callid an apostell becawse he persecutid the congregacion of Iesus Christ &c. Euen so I think that your grace doth this ygnorātlie / that ye haue done / and being therto perswadid by your false dissembling bissho∣pes and clergie:the quene. Whom now that your grace hath warning / what they are: beware from hence forth that ye folowe ther counsel no more in persecuting Christes poure mēbres / which haue bene the trwe prearchers of his holy and blessid worde / but do ye as s. Paul dyd when he was callid / And submitt
your selff / vnder the mighty hand of god / and tur∣ne to the lord our god who is able ād wyll receyue you to grace and mercye as he dyd. S. Paul / of ye repent ād do as he dyd / wherby you shall saue your selff and the whole Ralme frō Ruyne and vtter di¦strucciō.vvarned. But yf you wyll not submitt your selff vn¦der the mighty hād of god / ād turn to the lord our god vnfainidlie / and folowe no more / the wyckid cousell of your bloudy bisshoppes ād clergie / in per¦secuting Christes pour members / and wyll not re∣ceyue and knowledge the time of your visytacion. Then be ye assuryd / that lyki as it happenyd to the Iwes / for persecuting christe and hys pour mem∣bers / so shall it happen to you and to the whole Re¦alme / as in the beginnyng of this supplicacion is declaryd at lavge. The which I pray god defend yff it be hys holy wyll and plasure / whom I besech to open the eyes of your hart / that ye may receiue hys worde / and vnfallyble veryte / which may saue your soule in the great day of the lord / whom I be¦sech to graunt you grace thus to do / for his deare sone Iesus Christes sake amen. Thauthor io the No¦blemē and gētillmen.ANd now wyll I speake to you noble men / gen∣tillmen and comons of England / that haue of the abbey and chauntrey lands in your hands thinke you to enioie them to you and to your heires now that ye haue receiuid the bisshope of Rome a∣gaine &c. Ye ar farr deceiuid / do ye not knowe that the deuell is a crafty serpent / and loke wher he get∣tithin hys head / ther will he shortly haue in also
his hole body? but ye will saie that the bisshop of Rome by his legate cardinall Pole hath dispensid with you for thē / and that it is so concludid by acte of parliament. Well / I say ye deceiue your sel∣ues. do you not know / that in the first perliament of the quene / when / xx. of the comon house / were sent to here grace / and dyd declare vnto here / the great enormites / that wold folowe to the Reame / yf that she maried with any stranger / desiring her∣re therfore to marie within the realme.Request made in the first parliamēt to the que¦ne. But that wold not our bisshopes suffer / for they knew yf the quene maried wythin the realme / they should not so sone / haue brought in the B. of Rome againe / nor yet haue bene sure of ther wyckid and deuely∣she enterprise. But they knew / yf the quene maried wyth the prince of spaine / that he wolde not tro∣ble hym selff any thyng wyth ther affaires / hauing no more wytt then wold serue for hym selff / but they casting how to come to haue the hole antory∣torie of the Realm in ther own hāds / (lyke as they now haue) myght stablishe ther wyckyd kingdom / wythout any lert or interrupcion. The next perliament / the articles were debatyd apon / ād by the helpe of the bisshoppes were con∣cludid / vnder whych articles thes were agreid a∣pon / that is / that the prince of spaine shold not pro¦mote admitt nor aduaunce any stranger to any of∣fice or benifice / with in this Realm / but only the quenes naturall subiectes.Articles cōcluded and agre∣ed vpon. And that he should meintein all the old and ancient customs and pri∣uileges of this Realm. And shall not enterprise to
do any thyng against them.

Do not you also know that the bysshoppes went about the other perliament / to sett vp the bysshop of Rome ād how that it was denied at that tyme / becawse the state of the Realm fearyd that then / whiche shall come now apon them / that is the losses of ther abbey and chauntry lands / &c.

Wherfore god was worth wyth them / and delyue¦ryd thē in to the hāds of the hethen ther enemyes which pyllyd / and oppressyd them (lyke as the strā¦gers wyll do vs shortlye / onles god help be tymes)
then thy cryed to the lord sayeng / we haue synnyd / for we haue forsakē the lord our god / and haue ser¦uyd balym / &c.O Eng∣lād kno∣svvledge thyne of∣ence, like¦vvyse. And the lord sayd vnto them / dyd not the Egypcyans / the Amorytes / and the Phy∣lystynes / &c. opresse you / and ye cryed vnto me / and I delyueryd you out of ther hands / and for all that ye haue forsakē me / ād seruyd strāg gods / wherfore I wyll help you no more / go ād crye vnto the gods which ye haue chosen / and lett thē saue you in the tyme of your trybulacyon. And they confessyd / and sayd vnto the lord / we haue synnyd / do thou wyth vs what so euer pleasyth the / delyuer vs only thys tyme.A nota∣ble exam¦ple for ēg¦land. And they put awaye ther strangs gods / frō them / ād seruyd and delyueryd them out of ther ene∣myes hands / &c.Iere. 18. Ieuy. 26. Math. 11. Exodi. 3.14. Iud 2.3.6. Therfore lett vs wyth depe syth¦yng ernestly consyder how greuously we haue prouokyd gods Iust yre and vengeance agaynst vs / for so redelye receyuyng the wyckyd masse and yeldyng ther vnto / wyth other lyke abhomynacy∣ons. And lett vs turne to the lorde our god vnfay∣nyd lye / wyth trwe repentance. And he wyll not re¦fuse vs / but wyll hear vs / and deale wyth vs / as he dyd wyth hys people of old / yf we cast awaye / our own inuencyons and adhomynacions of ydo∣latrus worshyppyng hym as they dyd.. And be thou assuryd gentyll reader / that god our heuenly father / is mercy full / pacyent / and long suffryng / And wyll help vs / dowbt thou not therof at hys tyme appoyntyd / for he hath no pleasure in our dy∣structyō / but
as a louyng father / after a storm / sen∣dyth fayer wether / after mournyng and heuynes / he sendyth great Ioye / and gladnes / wherfo∣re hys holy name be praysyd for euermore / Amen. Praye Praye Praye. To the lyuynge only: be geuen all honoure and glorye. Anno M.D.L.
