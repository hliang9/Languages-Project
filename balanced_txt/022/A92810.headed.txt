The Preface TO THE READER. Courteous Reader, HAving lately perused a little Book, called HIND's Ram∣ble, or a History of his pranks and Exploits, and finding ma∣ny of his Knaveries undiscovered, I thought good to publish to the World these ensuing Stories of him as a secnd part, to give Gen∣tlemen and Travellers direction to avoyd many dangers, which they may fall into: and to give you, as neer as I can, a more per∣fect character of him. This James Hinde was by his Country, Glocestershire, his former profession a Butcher, which, had he not been drawn away with ill company, might have maintained him in an honest
way: For Sleights and stratagems none can parallel him: he may be called a Ma∣ster in the Art of Theevery, as the cun∣ningest and wisest of the Company, for dif∣ficult and dangerous Thefts; he hath the Theory and Practique of the Art: He hath not his name for nought: for when mounted, he is as swift as a Hinde, as ra∣pacious as an Eagle, nothing comes amiss: and to palliate all these, he is a fine compa∣nion, facetious and witty: and to be short, he hath more tricks then a hundred of his fraternity: so much for his character. And thus, courteous Reader, have I gi∣ven a true relation, in this various and plea∣sant History, of the wicked pollicies of HINDE and his Companions, that thou may be forewarned of unhappily falling into their dangers; also it may serve as a warn∣ing peece to those that are wickedly inclined, that they may be led from the Precipice of Perdition into the safe way of Vertue and Honesty.
The second Discovery of HINDE's Exploits. BEING A full Relation of his Robberies, Cozenage, and Escapes. 1 How Hinde being left alone, and most of his Crue disperst by a Hue and Cry, not having his own horse, and in distress for money, rob'd five Gentlemen as they were riding to a wedding; and how he was taken Prisoner. HINDE having intelligence of a great Feast made by a Coun∣try
Gentleman, where were many Gentlemen to meet, who lived some four, or six, or ten miles off the place appointed, there being a wedding, or some such like occasion, takes his Horse in the morning, and coasting the Country, meets with a Gentle∣man and his man riding towards the foresaid House, bids them Stand, and without much dispute the Gen∣tleman delivers him 20. pounds in Gold, thinking it better to scape with a whole skin, then lose his mony, and be beaten to boot. By that time they were parted comes to his view an an∣cient Penifather, with his only heir, who one would not have thought would have parted with their money so quietly: Hinde knowing 'twas no time for him to dally, bids them Stand, sets his pistol to the brest of the young gallant; the old man be∣ing struck with a pannick fear, cries out, Save his life, and take his money, which was quickly done, together
with his Sword; and then it came to the old mans turn to deliver, who was as ready to give as he to ask: their pockets being both emptied, Hinde threw the young gallant his Sword again, and bad him learn to make bet∣ter use of it, and draw it as occasion was offered. But the old man, willing to save the credit of his son, resolved to make no words of it, and the gen∣tleman before (being robbed) had taken the same resolution also, that the Ladies should not laugh at their hard fortune. Hinde immediately taking another rode, meets another Gentleman riding to the same house, and he resolving to make his fore∣noons work worth his labour, bids him Stand, the Gentleman drew, Hinde shewed him his pistol; You may thank that for your prize (quoth the Gentleman,) your sword should not have won my mony. At which gal∣lantry Hinde was well pleased, and gave him five of his fifteen peeces
back again. By this time Hinde thought his mornings work was over, it growing towards dinner time in∣tended to march towards his Com∣radoes, who were disperst by a Hue and Cry, which followed them three days before for another Robbery: and having not his own horse under him, thought it not best to stay too long thereabouts: Having no sooner taken this resolution, but he spies an∣other young Gentleman (supposed to be a younger Brother) upon a good Gelding riding that way; Hind being full of confidence, resolved to take his Mony and be gone, bids him Stand, at which word the Gentle∣man dismounts, and draws his sword; quoth Hinde, Shall I be troubled more with thee, than all that be gone before? Since thou art so gallant, thou shalt have fair play for thy Money: puts up his pistol, dismounts also, and draws his sword; and having made a close or two, neither being wounded, Hind
would as willingly have been rid of his Gamester, as the Gentleman would have been of him; But ere they could agree on the matter, came riding an old Gentleman with a sur∣ly Serving-man, who knew the en∣gaged Gentleman, and was quickly off his Horse with his sword drawn; Quoth Hinde, We are two fair game∣sters, we need no third man: Yes al∣ways, quoth the Serving-man, at in and in, which I suppose is your sport; With that the Gentleman made a close with Hinde, and quickly the Serving-man had his hand in Hinde's pocket, but drew forth nought but his pistol, at which Hinde yeelded himself Prisoner.
2 How Hinde, after he was taken pri∣soner by the last Gentleman and Ser∣ving-man, was carried to Dinner with them, where he met with all those he had robbed that morning; and after much pleasant discourse, gave them the slip with a good geld∣ing worth 50 pounds. HInde being taken prisoner by the young Gentleman and Ser∣ving man, thought it good to go quietly with them, that so be might be the better able to make an escape when he saw occasion; and said, Sir, I am now your prisoner, pray let me know whither you are riding; Quoth he, but to a Gentlemans house about two miles off, to dine with some friends, whither I intend you shall march; Quoth Hinde, I beleeve there be some gentlemen gone before will be glad to see me. You shall be civilly used, quoth the Gentleman,
and dine with us, and then shall I deliver you to the Justice. They being come to the house, Dinner being set, the Master of the House saluted Hinde, and bad him welcom, as the young Gentlemans friend, and caused him to sit down at Table; Hinde takes a glass of wine in his hand, and drinks to all the Company, especially to those of his acquaint∣ance (as he called them) whom he had robbed in the morning. Quoth the old Penifather, Couldst thou not be content with so good a breakfast, but must thou come and affront my son and me at Dinner? At which words the whole business was understood, and the one said, he was robbed of so much, and another of so much, and all acknowledged what they had lost. I thank ye all Gentlemen, quoth Hinde, for my breakfast; but I am most engaged to this Gentleman, for he would not let me pass till he brought me to a plentiful Dinner. Much mirth
past at the Table, and Hinde fitted them with very good discourse for the day; That pleased the company so well, that each man endevored to shew him what favor they could; so that after Dinner they took him out into the Court, where the Ma∣ster of the House had a gallant yong Gelding, never backt before that day, which was very unruly, and had thrown two or three Riders; quoth Hinde, if it please you Gentlemen to give me leave, I shall bring this Gelding to a pace in a quarter of an hour; There being a high wall round the yard, none mistrusted his inten∣tion; he mounts the Gelding with the Masters leave, and was commend∣ed by all the Gentlemen for a very good horseman; having sufficiently chafed and madded the mettalsom Beast, and spying a little broken place in the wall, with a full carier leapt the gelding over, and turning about, said, I thank you all Gentlemen for my
Breakfast and Dinner, but I must sup above forty miles off this night. So the Clark lost his labor in making his Mittimus, and his Master a Gelding worth fifty pounds. 3 How Hinde cozened an Inn-Keeper, by pretending himself to be some great Lord, to the value of threescore pounds. THere is no game comes amiss, but Hinde hath skill in it; in his low Estate he hath his conceits, and now he is a pretended Lord, here we shal shew you how he sends some of his Comradoes in the habit of Serving-men to take up a Lodging for their Master in an Inn, telling that he was a great Lord, and was desirous to lie there about some busi∣ness; but withall they told him he must have extraordinary fare, as Rab∣bits and Chickens, and all other dainties, no Butchers meat would
go down with him; and to colour the business, he sent him two great iron bound chests, with strong locks, and mailed with cords, and gave or∣der they should be put in the best room in the House, as if there had been some rich business in it; So when the Lodging was fitted, the next day comes in Hinde like a great Lord, or Don of Spain, and was welcomed by the Host with a great deal of respect and honor; nothing was omitted that might any way give him content: And thus he continu∣ed for some certain time; for he went out upon his Robbery, and came in again in his Coach, and none suspected or mistrusted; and when he thought he had layn there long e∣nough, for fear of discovery he took an occasion to borrow threescore pounds of his Host, pretending some extraordinary business; the credu∣lous Host beleeves him, and lends it him, he having (as he thought) such
good security; But (the Bird being now flegged, it is time to take wing and be gone,) Hinde goes out in the morning in his Coach, but was too wise to come any more there: he is expected at night, but no Lord comes, his Lordship was gone another pro∣gress; he stays a week, and appears not; a Moneth expires, and he is not seen: At last the Host begins to be jealous, and mistrusts, That all is not gold that glisters; He now begins to think, there's some Knave∣ry; and (to be short) calls a Con∣stable, and he sits ready to take an Inventory of the goods in the chests; The two great Chests are unmailed, or uncorded, the Locks are broken open; which being done, alass then his grief appears; For in stead of rich treasure, he finds nothing but two Chests full of stones and old rubbish cram'd together.
4 How Hinde cozened a Merchant in Holland of 300 Crowns, by giv∣ing a counterfeit chain for a pledg. THis jovial Gamester, Hinde, being in Holland, having spent his Mony, casts his wits about how to recrute himself; and you know good workmen never want their tools: You may remember I told you how he served the Inn-Keeper, just almost in the same manner he beguiles the Dutchman; He goes af∣ter the fashion of a Gallant, the better to set a gloss upon his Knave∣ry; he hath his man to wait upon him; and by his gallant garb insinu∣ates into a rich Merchants acquaint∣ance; makes the World beleeve he hath brought the wealth of the Indies with him; he pretends he hath great wealth, and happy were he that could be acquainted with him, for it is the nature of the Dutchmen to strike
sail for their own profit, to offer any Kindness where they perceive they may be any way a gainer: Amongst the rest, a Merchant of no mean qua∣lity perceiving his deportment, in∣vites him to his house; this gudgeon with little entreaty quickly swallows the bait, and accepts his proffer; when come to his House the Mer∣chant entertains him with a great deal of civility; Hinde pretends to send one of his men to his two chests, which were aboard of a ship in the Key, for some Money, which made the Merchant say, Sir, I much wonder you being a stranger dare trust your wealth in such a place; if you please sir, my house shall be at your pleasure. But Hinde takes an occasion upon dis∣course to pull out of a Box a Chain of pure gold before the Merchant, which he much admiring, said, Sir, you need not want Money so long as you have this to engage. Hinde replyed, I should be loath to engage it but up∣on
on necessity, which I am now driven to; For although I have Money, yet I cannot command it, because I must pay it presently upon a Bill of ex∣change: Sir, replyed the Merchant, I shall befriend you so far as to lend you so much money as you have occasion for: Which proffer Hinde as modestly denyed, yet with a kinde of willing unwillingness he kindly accepted his courtesie, and presently called for his man to take the Chain, and see what the Goldsmith would value it at, and to bring a Test under his hand. The Merchant as seeming unwilling to receive his Chain as a pledg, replyed, Good Sir do not trouble your self so, I dare take your word for more then this sum; (yet his fingers itcht to be fin∣gering of this pawn;) Hinde the more puts it upon him, seeing his un∣willingness to receive it;) Well Sir, saith the Merchant, seeing it is your pleasure, my man shall go with your ser∣vant to see the value of it at the Gold∣smiths.
Hinde calls his man, deli∣vers him the Chain, and together they go, and bring a Test under the Goldsmiths hand, who finds it right and rich. Now Hinde had playd his game so, that he had provided his man with another Chain of brass gilded, of the same weight to a grain, that you could not know the one from the other; and coming home, delivers the brass Chain and Ticket to Hinde; Hinde delivers them to the Merchant, he looks upon it, finds it (to his thinking) the same, sees no∣thing to the contrary: So Hinde re∣ceives his 300 Crowns, and when they had dined and talked, Hinde and his man took their leaves for the pre∣sent, as pretending to go about bu∣siness, but never returned to redeem his Chain, but left the Merchant to repent him of his dear bought pur∣chase.
5 How Hinde and his Myrmidons rob∣bed a Company of Tories in Ire∣land. WHen Hinde was in his pro∣gress in Ireland, he would sometimes scout out, and lurk about for a prey, with the rest of his Com∣radoes, and by chance he met two or three Tories, who had got a prize of Money and Plunder, and were re∣turning to their Fastues, or Quarters, but they had not so good luck with it as they expected, for Hinde and his Myrmidons fall in to them, and make them believe they were of their profession, as indeed they were, but in another way; but one of the To∣ries had a jealous minde that Hinde was not a true Brother, whereupon he asked him what he was: What am I, quoth Hinde? A Brother of the Blade, and that thou shalt know before we part; therefore deliver, or beleeve
it, this sword shall speak other language then you expect. The Gentlemen were much amazed at this unexpected an∣swer; They asked him, what he meant? What do I mean? I mean to try a touch whether or no that Mony you have shall be yours or ours; and to't they went; but Hinde so playd his game that he made them be glad to be rid of him upon such conditions as he liked, and they disliked, which was, to leave their Mony behinde them, and go home by the weeping cross, and cry, O hone, O hone! How Hinde, having lost his horse, rob∣bed a Countryman in Glocestershire, by laughing. HInde upon a time having lost his horse, meeting with a Coun∣tryman in Glocestershire; the Coun∣tryman being a pretty nimble fellow got away from him: but Hinde he as cunning, seeing he could not over∣take
take him, fell a laughing heartily, which made the Country-fellow re∣turn; thinking him to be some old acquaintance of his grown out of re∣membrance, that in jest had pursu'd him, returned back towards him; still Hinde laughed at his seeming ac∣quaintance, till the fellow came within danger, that he surprized him, and took ten pound away from him, but gave him twenty shillings again, and told him, Beleeve me not when I laugh again. How Hinde robbed a Butcher in York∣shire, by drawing him from his Com∣pany by discourse, and keeping pace with his horse. HInde coming into York-shire in the West-riding, met with a company of Butchers, which were going to a Fair to buy some Cattel; he hearing them discourse of their business, and what each party had to
bestow, he begins to take acquaint∣ance of the chiefest of them, and tell∣ing him he was of the same fraternity, and in that he lyed not, for he had been a Butcher, and therefore could discourse exactly of their profession; so cunningly did he disguise his kna∣very, and in his discourse being not mistrusted, he trotted pretty hard be∣fore the rest; the Butcher whom he singled out strived to keep pace with him, to hold discourse with him, till Hinde seeing his opportunity, and being a pretty way from the Compa∣ny, said to the Butcher, Friend, I must require you to deliver your purse; the Butcher deny'd: he presently pre∣sents his Pistol before him, which startled the Butcher, and made him deliver his money unto him, the sum being eighty pound, and so sent the Butcher to his fellows again.
How Hinde, in the habit of a serving∣man, rob'd a Traveller of 15.l. by laying a Cloak-bag in the high-way. ALL Professors have some more excellent in the Art then ano∣ther, and this Hinde he is in his pro∣fession, as sometimes he went in the habit of a Gentleman of great for∣tunes, sometimes in poor habit, and sometimes in a serving-mans habit: It fortuned, that lying in wait for some booty, sent out one of his gang that layd a Cloak-bag in the high∣way, where Travellers must of neces∣sity come by, where one coming by, seeing the Cloak-bag lie in the way, lighted from his horse, and went to take up the Cloak-bag; presently Hinde steps to him, and takes and robs him of fifteen pounds: this he did in the habit of a serving-man.
How Hinde put a trick upon a Dutch Mountebank in Holland. NOw Hinde being in Holland, and wanting money, being in a strange Country, he had nor that Command as he had in England, and to rob on the high-way as in England, hearing of a rich Mountebank that went about quacking of it, how he went never without store of money, his name was Henrick van Veldes, he was something fortunate in Cures, therefore by every one desired: this Mountebank going to visit his sick Patients in divers parts of the City, having received divers sums of money for his particular Cures, was watch∣ed by this Hinde, and as he passed through a by-street, he runs to him as in great haste, and salutes him in a kind manner, thus; Sir, I have heard much of your renown in Cures of dange∣rous consequence, and since it is my hap∣piness
to meet with you, I live not far from this place, if you please to go along with me to my house, I have a wife much troubled with a Flux in her belly for these fourteen days, and you by your ex∣perience may do her much good, if you please to give her a visit; I humbly re∣quest you to go along with me, and what content you desire, I shall willingly sa∣tisfie. This Bell sounded well in his ears: well, he goes with Hinde to his lodging, and in the way he gives Hinde comfortable answer, saying, God forbid I should neglect that little skill I have to do your wife any good I can: Upon these Complements Hinde leads him from one street to another, till at last he got him within his lodging, which was so contrived, that it was some distance from other houses; having lock'd the door upon him, he takes in one hand a Pistol, in the other a great empty purse, and fu∣riously looking upon the Mounte∣bank, he said, Sir, here is my wife,
(meaning the empty Purse,) she hath been a long time troubled with a Flux in her belly, and you are the onely man that can onely remedy and finde out a means to cure this disease; else I my self, by the help of this pistol, am resol∣ved to remedy it. This Mountebank seeing himself thus cunningly and suddenly surprized, began suddenly to cry out, but was presently silencd by the sight of the pistol, was fain for fear to let go his own purse to cure that purse which had the flux; but according to his wonted charity, seeing the man in this trembling con∣dition, he restored him some part of his Money again, promised to con∣vey him to his Lodging, and did with his pistol cockd, for fear of an out∣cry, and in the mid way left him and his lodging both together.
How Hinde and his Crue robbed a gen∣tleman of whom he had borrowed money, and how Hinde released him again. NOw Hinde having been in di∣stress, and borrowed Money of a Gentleman of his acquaintance, who knew not his manner and course of life; it fortuned this Gentleman travelling chanced to meet with this Hinde and his Companions as he was crossing a wood; he was set upon by them, and robbed of all his Mony, Besides, some of them were so cruel, that they would have killed him; but Hinde remembred his former cour∣tesies, and told them, Friends, we will spare his life, and provide for our own safety; So carrying him in∣to a thicket, they there tyed him to the body of a tree, and so left him; but Hinde spied his opportunity, and bid the Gentleman not to fear, for
he would come and release him; so Hind and his Comradoes went their way, and parted their booty; but af∣ter some time he returns, and unbinds him, and restores him his part of the prize. How Hinde and his Comradoes robbed a company of Theeves of an hundred pounds. THere was a certain Company of mad Blades, having spent their patrimony, the next work they take in hand is, God dam them, they would go take a purse too, to maintain them in their luxurious courses; and combined together to take the next opportunity: So it was the ill for∣tune of a Gentleman in Lincolnshire to be surprized by these Gallants of all his money; when they had their booty, they went out of that Coun∣ty, and came to an Inn where Hinde used to be; so there they were very
frollique and merry; and Hind ob∣serving their actions, he stood where they were to go away, and which way they were to go, he takes Horse with the rest of his Companions, and way lays them, and at the foot of an Hill they bid them Stand, and deliver: The Youngsters were much startled at it, and cry out, Why, we are your friends: What, Theeves fall out? We will fall in, saith Hinde; and so fell upon them, and took all the money they robbed the Lincolnshire Gentleman of, and their own, and left them, and away Hinde crost the Country.
How Hind cozen'd an Inn-keeper in Oxfordshire. HInd had many shifts, when put to a pinch, he sent some of his Comrades in the habit of Ser∣ving-men to take up lodging for their master in an Inn, telling the Inn∣keeper there was a great Lord to lie there about some businesse for some time, and wisht him to provide the best cheer could be devized, for he cared not for Butchers meat: and to colour the businesse, he sent two great iron chests bound and corded about, as if some rich treasure were in them, and gave order they should be set in the best room in the house; so when the lodging was fitted, the next day came in Hind like a great Lord, or Don of Spain, in his coach, attended by two Lacquaies and two Serving-men, having extraordinary respect from the Master of the house,
and so continued for a certain time, going in and out upon his robberies, but (having been there about a mo∣neth, paying for what he had) the Host mistrusted nothing, he coming in and out in his coach in that man∣mer: Hind took an occasion to bor∣row threescore pounds of his Hst, pretending some extraordinary busi∣nesse, and goes out in the morning in his coach, but came in no more: his Host thought he had been gone into the country and would return again, and consequently mistrusted not, because he conceived he had so good a pledge: but after he had been a∣bout a moneth absent, he made bold to open the chests, wherein was no∣thing but stones and brick-bats: so Hind had royall entertainment and money to boot.
How Hind rob'd a man and his wife neere Burford, and took all their mo∣ney from them. A Gentleman and his wife were travelling on their way to Bur∣ford, and Hind understanding that he had store of money, he beset him, and bid him deliver his purse; the Gentleman contested with him, with his sword drawn, Hind draws his pocket pistoll, and swore if he would not deliver he would pistoll him: the woman she cries out good husband deliver your money: the man what between Hinds threats, and his wifes cries and entreaties, Hind had the money delivered unto him: being a quarter of a mile off, the Gentleman comes into, and raises the Towne, but Hind was gone another way, and by the swiftnesse of his horse, got cleer from his pursuers.
How Hind escap'd being closely follow∣ed with a Hue and Cry for a great robbery that he had done in the habit of a Coun∣trey Grasier. HInd having done a great robbe∣ry in Darbyshire, and thinking himself secure, betook himself to an Inn, whch are as snctuaries to rob∣bers; and staying there somewhat longer then his time, he was pursued into the town by some horsemen; he knowing the matter, got his horse out of the stable, and took a back way, having on a gray coat in the ha∣bit of a Grasier: after he had beene some time gone, the pursuers had in∣telligence which way he went, his horse being almost weary, they came within sight of him, and perceived him to take into a field where were some horses at grasse, in which he no sooner came but he pull'd off his sad∣dle
and bridle, and threw them into a ditch with his sword and pistoll, and turn'd up his horse to grasse, pul'd off his own coat and turn'd it, which was black within, and with a Priests girdle he had in his pocket girt it to him, taking a little book out of his pocket, and walking under a hedge, as if he had been in study for a Ser∣mon: this was no sooner done, but his pursuers came to the place; seeing as they thought a Divine in meditati∣on, curteously desired of him if he saw any man come riding that way; Yes quoth Hind, with much speed in a gray coat, and the colour of his horse was much like that yonder you see at grasse, pointing to his own horse: he was the man, quoth they, pray which way did he tak? he took the hedge quoth Hnd; I suppose if you ride hard you may take him e're he comes to the next Town; they all gave him thanks, and with much speed hasted the way he directed them; when they were
gone, Hind laughed at their creduli∣ty, and taking his horse sadled him a∣gain, and rode his way. How Hind rob'd a Gentleman of his Watch on the high-way, and how friendly they parted. HInd, as his custome was, costing the Countrey, being never out of his way, meets with a Gentleman; quoth Hind, pray Sir how far ride you this way? the Gentleman answe∣red to Coventry, I shall rejoyce in your company, quoth Hind, I thank you sir said the gentleman, for there is some danger in this rode, for seldome a week passes but one or other is rob'd neer this place, but the best on't is, I have no money to loose, if I can keep my Watch I care not, I have been twice or thrice in danger of losing it already: Hind hear∣ing that the Gentleman had no mo∣ney, thought it best to take what he could get, and look for some other
companion: I pray sir, quoth he, what time of the day think you it is by your Watch? that you shall know present∣ly, quoth the Gentleman, and look∣ing on the same, said it's neer eleven? pay let me see, quoth Hind? the Gentleman gave him the Watch in∣to his hand, it's true indeed quoth Hind; and putting the Watch into his pocket, said, I should have been ten miles off e're this time, and you must mend your pace if you will keep me company; but howevr I shall have a care of your Watch that it take no hurt, for it never was in so much danger: so he took his leave of the gentleman, and bid him tell his friends he had been in the company of Iames Hind.
How Hind cheated a Lawyer of his Watch. HInd meeting with a Lawyer in a Tavern neer the road, fell in∣to company and were very merry to∣gether, Hind perceiving the Lawyer had a Watch in his pocket (by the key and string hanging out) made bold with it, which the Lawyer soon after miss'd and inquired after, wher∣up on Hind restored it to him again, with this Poeticall complement. A Watch in Tavern lost? Oh, that's a crime: See how in drinking men do lose their time: The string hung out, and you forgot to lock it, And so the Watch did slip out of your pocket. If you would keep your Watch, thus must you do; Pocket your Watch, but watch your pocket too. FINIS.
