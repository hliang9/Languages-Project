AN ODE UPON HIS Majesty's Birth-Day, Set to Musick by Dr. Staggins; Perform'd at WHITEHALL, November, 1694. Written by N. TATE, Servant to Their Majesties. SPRING, Where are thy Flowry Treasures? Where the Summer-Joys retreated? CAESAR's Festival Repeated, Shou'd renew your blooming Pleasures. To attend this Happy Morn, Nature should her self Adorn. Tho' the Gawdy Spring be dead, And the Joys of Summer fled; Winter has of Ivy store, Such as Great Alcides wore: Ivy and Lawrel, ever Gay, Their Verdure keep for CAESAR's Day. Our Hero's Warmth can sure inspire Coldest Orbs with vital Fire: Can absent Phoebus Task perform, And spight of Winter-Frost and Storm, Create a Joyful Quire.
Aloud the Joyful Muses call, Come Celebrate this Festival. From a Hero, for Valour and Virtue Renown'd, Let Envy retire, While the Graces conspire, With Lawrel and Myrtle his Brows to surround. All in one Harmonious Strein; Dale and Mountain, Grove and Fountain, Welcome CAESAR's Birth and Reign. Britain on CAESAR's Day shou'd Smile; From Shore to Shore resound with Mirth, Like Delos at Apollo's Birth That eas'd her Grief, and fix'd her Floating Isle. In Rome had such a CAESAR sway'd, Brutus and Cato had Obey'd. 'Tis Danger gives a Warrior Fame; Conquest by Bribes, or Stealth obtain'd, Honours true Sons have still disdain'd: Adventures Crown'd Brave Jason's Name; And Hercules by Toils o ercame. But see! the happy Season springs, That Joyful Peace to Europe brings: Vast Arrears of Bliss that may O'er-recompence the long Delay, And our Alcides Toils repay. Peaceful Arts shall then renew; Smiling Ages long ensue, To Britain's Royal Pair, (Her Guardian-Angel's Care) No less Success, no less Rewards are due. Grand CHORUS. When Laws are supported, and Monarchs are Mild, Empire and Freedom are then Reconcil'd. LONDON: Printed for Richard Baldwin, near the Oxford-Arms in Warwick-Lane. MDCXCIV.
