LONDONS LORD HAVE MERCY UPON US. A true Relation of Seven modern Plagues or Visitations in London, with the number of those that were Buried of all Diseases; viz The first in the year of Queen ELIZABETH, Anno 1592. The second in the year 1603 the third in (that never to be forgotten year) 1625. The fourth in Anno 1630. The fift in the year 1636. The sixt in the year 1637. and 1638 The seventh this present year. 1665. REader, what ever thou art, rich or poor, Rowse up thy self, for Death stands at the door; If God sayes strike, he must & wil come in For death we know is the reward of sin. His very breath is so infectious grown, He poysons every one he breathes upon; He is the Rich-man's terrour, makes him flye, And bear away his baggs, as loath to die. What shall the Poor do that behind do stay? Death makes them rich, by taking them away. But what shall Poor men do, that here do live, 'Tis surely fit the Rich should comfort give, And weekly Means unto them still afford: Oh such Rich men shall be rich in the Lord! Death startles all, but more the guilt of sin, Which sinful man long time hath lived in, Doth make them fearful of that punishment Due unto sin, for time that's evil spent. Oh why was this not thought on long ago! When God expected our Repentance so? Seventeen years since, a little Plague God sent, He shoke his Rod to move us to repent: Not long before that time, a dearth of Corn Was sent to us to see if we would turn: And after that, there's none deny it can; The Beasts did suffer for the sin of man: Grass was so short and small, that it was told, Hay for four pound a Load was daily sold. These Judgements God hath sent even to cite us Unto Repentance, and from sin to fright us. Oh stubborn England! childish and unwise, So heavy laden with iniquities: Return, return, unto thy loving Father, Return I say with speed, so much the rather, Because his Son thy Saviour pleads thy cause, Though thou hast broken all his holy Lawes: Say to thy self, My sins are cause of all Gods Judgements that upon this I and do fall, And sin's the cause that each one doth complain, They have too much, sometimes to little rain: Say to thy self, this Plague may be removed, If I repent, as plainly may be proved By Niniveh, that City great and large, For God hath given unto his Angels Charge, To strike and to forbear as he sees sit; If it be so, then learn thou so much wit, To use thy best endeavour to prevent A plague, which thou mayst do if thou repent, Let all infected Houses be thy Text, And make this Ʋse, that thine may be the next. The Red Crosse still is us'd, as it hath bin. To shew they Christians are that are within: And Lord have mercy on us on the door, Puts thee in mind, to pray for them therefore. The Watchman that attends the house of sorrow, He may attend upon thy house to morrow. Oh where's the vows we to our God have made! When death & sickness came with axe & spade, And hurl'd our Brethren up in heaps space, Even forty thousand in a little space: The Plague among us is not yet removed, Because that sin of us is still beloved. Each spectacle of Death and Funerall, Puts thee and I in mind, We must die all. An exact and true relati∣on of the number of those that were buried in Lon∣don and the Liberties of all Diseases, from the 17 of March 1591. to the 22 of December, 1592.   totall Pl.
