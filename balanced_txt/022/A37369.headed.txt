A DECLARATION OF THE COMMANDER in CHIEF IN SCOTLAND, And the Officers under his Command, In Vindication of the Liberties of the People, and Priviledges of Parliament. HAVING to the great grief of Our Hearts, information of a most unhappy difference fallen out between the PARLIAMENT and some Officers of the ARMY at LONDON, which hath occasioned the displacing of sundry Officers: And also the interrupting of the Members of PARLIAMENT in the discharge of their Duty. Wee therefore, having earnestly besought the LORD to direct Us in this great and Weighty Affair, wherein the Liberty, and Peace of these Nations, and the Interest of the godly and Faithfull therein is so nearly concerned, Do find it our Duty to Declare, and do hereby Declate, That we shall use Our Christian endeavours to the utmost, for the begetting a right Understanding and Reconciliation between the PARLIAMENT and the said Officers of the said ARMY. And We do also Declare, That We shall through the strength of God assert and maintain the Freedom and Priviledge of the present PARLIAMENT, that was so often and lately acknowledged, the Supream Authority of the Nations, and not suffer the Members thereof to be illegally interrupted, or molested in the discharge of their Duties. And We do solemnly Vow to all the World, That our only intention in doing this, is to preserve the Rights of Our Coun∣trey, And to Protect and encourage all the godly and faithfull therein, according to Our Declaration to the Churches lately emit∣ted and Published: And likewise to establish the Peace or these Nations, and the Government of a Free State or Common∣wealth, to which We stand Obliged by several Vowes and Engagements made bofore God and many Witnesses. And as We have within us the Testimony of sincere hearts, and unbyased Consciences to encourage us in these Underta∣kings: so we doubt not of the concurrent Assistance of all the unprejudiced faithful in the Land; For whose sakes principally We are drawn forth to this Engagement. And We therefore invite all Our Brethren of the ARMY, and of the MILITIA, and of all others that professe Love to God, and to his People, and to their own, and their Posterities Liberty, to come and give us their chearful ayd in this Work whereunto the Lord hath called Us, lest they be made a Prey to the Lusts of Men, and then bewaile the losse of this Opportunity which God hath put into their Hands. Signed in the Name, and by Consent of the Commander in Chief, and the Officers of the ARMY in SCOTLAND, VILLIAM CLARK,Secretary. EDENBURGH, Printed by Christopher Higgens in Harts-Close over against the Trone Church, And Re-printed at LONDON for general satisfaction, 1659.
