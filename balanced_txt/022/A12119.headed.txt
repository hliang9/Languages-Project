SIR ANTONY SHERLEY HIS RELATION OF HIS TRA∣VELS INTO PERSIA. THE DANGERS, AND DIS∣tresses, which befell him in his passage, both by sea and land, and his strange and vnexpected deliuerances. HIS MAGNIFICENT ENTERTAINE∣ment in PERSIA, his Honourable imployment there-hence, as Embassadour to the Princes of Chri∣stendome, the cause of his disapointment there∣in, with his aduice to his brother, Sir ROBERT SHERLEY, ALSO, A TRVE RELATION OF THE great Magnificence, Valour, Prudence, Iustice, Tempe∣rance, and other manifold Vertues of ABAS, now King of PERSIA, with his great Conquests, whereby he hath inlarged his Dominions. Penned by Sr. ANTONY SHERLEY, and recommended brother, Sr. ROBERT SHERLEY, being now in pro¦cution of the like Honourable Imployment. LONDON Printed for Nathaniell Butter, and Ioseph Bagfet. 1613.
TO THE READER MAny haue beene desirous to vnderstand on what hopes, helpes, and grounds, Sir Anthony Sherley, with his brother Sir Ro∣bert Sherley, and many other friends and followers, of our Nation, could not onely be induced to vndertake to trauell into a King∣dome so farre remote, and to liue amongst a people so farre different in Religion, Lan∣guage, and Manners, as that of Persia is from ours: but also he supplied of all necessa∣ries for life, in a plenteous and magnificent manner; and so highly endeare his seruice
and industry to that King and State, as to bee esteemed and called a Mirza, or Prince of Persia, and to bee employed, within few monthes after his comming thither, as Em∣bassador from so great a Potentate, in a matter of such mane consequence and trust, to many of the greatest Princes and States of Christendome. And no lesse haue many meruailed, how, after his failing in the accomplishment of so great an enterprise, for want of due corres∣pondence in an Instrument, hee had taken vnto him, out of that Country for his better credence, his Brother Sir Robert Sherley, whom hee left behind him in Persia, could not onely maintaine his reputation, but win so much credite with that King, as to be ho∣noured with the Title of his Embassadour, to the Princes of Christendome, in the like employment newly reuiued. At his late being here in England (where
hee hath beene so accepted as in the Courts of other great Princes of Christendome) a Gentleman of some vnderstanding conuer∣sing oftentimes with him, and being desirous of true information, concerning that action (whereof he had formerly heard, and read some incoherent and fabulous reports) con∣ferred with him often, concerning the car∣riage, and circumstances of their procee∣dings: and thereby gaue him occasion to dis∣course vnto him as well of the motiues of that enterprise, as of many accidents that befell him and his Brother in the conduct of that affaire. Wherein, al-be-it hee receiued good satisfaction in diuers particularities; yet, be∣cause the questions, occasioning such dis∣course, were but incidently moued; and (by many occasions that happened) their confe¦rences were often interrupted: On the en¦treaty of the said Gentleman, for the better satisfying of himselfe, and such others of
his friends, as might bee desirous, out of their curiosity, to vnderstand the whole pro∣gresse, dependance, and prosecution of the said voyage into Persia, hee obtained of the Persian Embassadour, a Copy of this dis∣course, penned by his Brother Sir Anthony Sherley (as it seemeth) since his returne out of Persia into Europe, for the better satis∣faction of his friends, and preseruing the memory of so memorable an action. To these labours of his Brother, Sir Ro∣bert Sherley himselfe as time and opportu∣nity shall giue him leaue, hath promised some addition of his owne endeuours: which being not yet in such readinesse, as his friends haue wished and desired; This discourse being but the former part, yet containing the Register f so rare an attempt (whatsoeuer the suc∣sse hath bene, or may bee) as hath seldome bene seene in this, or any former age, by a priuate Gentleman to haue beene enterpri∣zed,
the same being recorded by his owne pen who hath beene the first and chiefe Actor in it, hath bene thought by men of mature iudge∣ment, to whom it hath beene communicated, (besides the History it selfe which is pleasing and delightfull) to containe many fruitfull aduertisements. So that hauing in it both the eleuations of a high spirit, and the obseruations of a man experienced and versed in great affaires: it is the rather vnto thee re-commended.
THE TRVE History of Sir Anthony Sherleys Trauels into Persia, Penned by himselfe. SINCE men are brought forth vpon the earth for good ends, the princi∣pallest of which is the glory of God, and then to better the world; in which many haue had bands, either of necessity, or other occupations, to haue lesse experience by their knowledge: I thinke, I should migh∣tily erre, if I should not deliuer as well to others, what I haue seene and learned by my passing so many, and so strange countries; as I should haue done, if had not giuen my time and the expence of it to the first end, which was, and is, God his great glory. In my first yeares, my friends bestowed on mee those learnings which were fit for a Gentlemans ornament, without directing them to an occupation; and when they were fit for agible things, they bestowed them and me on my Princes seruice, in which I ran many courses, of diuers fortunes, according to the condition of the warres, in
which, as I was most exercised, so was I most subiect to accidents: With what opinion I carried my selfe (since the causes of good or ill must be in my selfe, and that a thing without my selfe) I leaue it to them to speake; my places yet in authority, in those occasions were euer of the best; in which, if I committed errour it was contrary to my will, and a weakenesse in my iudgement; which, notwith∣standing, I euer industriated my selfe to make perfect, cor∣recting my owne ouer-sights by the most vertuous exam∣ples I could make choise of: Amongst which, as there was not a Subiect of more worthinesse and vertue, for such examples to grow from, then the euer-liuing in honour, and condigne estimation the Earle of Essex, as my reue∣rence and regard to his rare qualities was exceeding; so I desired (as much as my humility might answere, with such an eminency) to make him the patterne of my ciuill life, and from him to draw a worthy modell of all my acti∣ons. And as my true loue to him, did transforme me from my many imperfections, to bee, as it were, an imitator of his vertues; so his affection was such to mee, that hee was not onely contended, I should do so, but in the true Noblenesse of his minde gaue me liberally the best trea∣sure of his mind in counselling mee; his fortune to helpe mee forward; and his very care to beare mee vp in all those courses, which might giue honour to my selfe, and in∣worthy the name of his friend: in so much, that after many actions, into which, peraduenture, he prouoked my owne slackenesse, The Duke of Ferrara dying, and leauing Don Cesare D'Este Inheritor of that Principality, who by his birth could, indeed, challenge nothing iustly, being a Ba∣stard; notwithstanding, in the worlds opinion hee was most likely to haue bene established in that succession, through the long continuance of the gouernment in that name; and the Princes of that name, hauing euer through
their temperate and iust condition of Ruling, wouen themselues into a sincere affection of that people: which was well proued, by that great league made against it in former time by the Pope, the French, and the Venetians, frustrated by the true deuotion of those Subiects to their Prince; besides, the great expectation, which was gene∣rally had of that Don Cesare, and the extreme bondage of the gouernment of the Church, which those that haue li∣ued in another quality do vtterly abhorre. Which that excellent Earle also considering, and besides (hauing no thought in him euer separated from those circumstances, which might bring to an happy end his infinite desire of her Maiesties Honour, Seruice, and prosperous good of his Country,) iudging that the Pope would not giue his claime vnto the Dutchy without words, and actes, and by the impotency of both those Princes in themselues, both to make and continue so great a warre (as that was likely to haue bene by former examples) but that it must grow to great partiallities: The lesser Princes of Italy being not likely to endure the Churches so great encrease of Tem∣porality, which errour was so greatly reprehended by them all in Lewis the twelfth King of France; And that gi∣uing place to the right of that title, they should interesse him in the same iudgement for Vrbine also, and many other places: so that the war, by these reasons, in all appea∣rance likely to bee somented: and that the King of Spaine, both in hope to better his estates in Italy by that trouble, and by necessity to preserue those, which hee had already, and for being Vicar to the Church, and obliged for his kingdome of Naples, must be imbarked fully in that action; which would haue bene both a great diuersion from his other designes, and a facillitating of any enterprise, which that generous spirit of that Earle was euer framing, and vndertaking against him: and holding opinion that the
Dukes greatest necessity at the first must bee of incou∣ragement, and Captaines, sent mee presently (though the least amongst many) accompanied with diuers Soul∣diers of approued valour, and procured the Count Mau∣rice, Generall of the States Army, to write him letters of as much comfort, as could bee giuen from so braue a Prince, and so famous an Estate: and though my iourney was vnder-taken in the dead of Winter, and I left no paines vntaken to accelerat it; yet before I could arriue in Italy, I found the Duke giuen ouer to quieter resolutions, and Ferrara yeelded to the Pope; himselfe satisfying himselfe with Modona, and Rhegium, of which hee now beareth the Title. Which when I had aduertised the Earle of; as he, who neuer had his owne thoughts, limited, with∣in any bounds of honourable and iust ambition; So he also desired, that those whom he had chosen into a neerenesse of affection should also answere both his owne conceipt of them, and satisfie the world in his election of them: wherefore, not willing I should returne, and turne such a voice as was raised of my going to nothing; as vnwilling that I should, by a vaine expence of my time, money, and hope, bee made a scorne to his and (through him) to my enemies: Hee proposed vnto me (after a small relation, which I made vnto him from Venice) the voiage of Persia, grounding of it vpon two points. First, the glory of God; to which, his excellent religious mind was euermore deuote. Then, if God would not please to choose me as a worthy instrument to that great end; yet by making a profitable experience of my seeing those Countries, limitting vpon the King of Spaines vniall parts, and answering to her Maiesties Merchants trades in Turky, and Muskouy; and besides, being not vnlikely but some parts might haue bene found fit for the Indian Nauiga∣tion, then principiated in Holland, and muttered of in Eng∣land;
It might proue a subiect to extract great and good matter out of, for the honor of her Maiestie, and the perti∣cular good of our Country: Besides, some more priuate de∣signes, which my fortune, being of the condition, which my persecutions haue brought it vnto, counselleth mee not to speake of: though they were most worthy ones, and honourable, and honest in him, as a great Subiect, and maine Piller of that State, which hee was bound to serue by all meanes and all industry. Hauing with these Aduer∣tisements receiued strength to my owne minde, large meanes and letters of fauour and credit to the company of Merchants at Aleppo; without opening the secrets of my deliberation to any, as fearing the strange humour of the world, rather inclined to mis-iudge of all actions, then to giue them onely a charitable construction: not willing to be scorned if it effected not; and assuring my selfe of all sort of reputation, if it proceeded well. I imbarked my selfe at Venice for Aleppo, in a Venetian ship, called the morizell, the foure and twentieth of May 1599. Fiue and twenty daies the Ship was sailing betweene Malmocko the Port of Venice, and Zant; in which space one of the worst in the Ship, a passenger to Ciprus, vsed most scandalous speeches of her Maiesty, which being brought vnto mee, not onely moued with the dutifull zeale which a Subiect oweth to his Prince; but euen with that respect which euery Gentleman oweth to a Lady, I commaunded one of my people to giue him a fit reward for so vile an abuse: which was no sooner done, but the Shippe was all in an vprore. And though the cause of the act was iust, and so vnder∣stood by diuers principall Merchants, which went to Zant, and that the punishment was nothing proporti∣onable to the sceleratnesse of the fact; yet through the instigation of one Hugo de Potso, a Portingall Factor,
which was going to Ormus (though they shewed all to bee satisfied, because they durst do no other, yet) when wee were to haue departed in the ship from Zant, they would no more receiue vs, so that wee were forced to hire a Car∣ramosall to carry vs to Candy, where wee receiued most honourable entertainement, (the comming of strangers thither being a thing so vnsuall that the Duke desired to shew the Magnificence of the great Signory to vs that came first; and peraduenture should bee the last for a long time.) From thence in the same Carramosall wee departed to Cyprus, and Paphos, where wee found nothing to answere the famous relations giuen by ancient Histores of the ex∣cellency of that Iland, but the name onely, (the barba∣rousnesse of the Turke, and time, hauing defaced all the Monuments of Antiquity) no shew of splendor, no ha∣bitation of men in a fashion, nor possessors of the ground in a Principallity; but rather Slaues to cruell Maisters, or prisoners shut vp in diuers prisons: so grieuous is the bur∣then of that miserable people, and so deformed is the state of that Noble Realme. Notwithstanding, the pre∣sent power (I meane resident in that Iland, which is the in∣strument of that great tyranny) is so small, that if the lit∣tle remnant of people, which is left there had courage; or if they haue courage, had also armes; or if the Princes Christian had but a compassionate eye turned vpon the miserable calamity of a place so neere them, rent from the Church of God, by the vsurpation of Gods and the worlds great enemy: and maintained more by the terrour, which his name hath stroke into some truely; into others no more, but that they are contented hee should bee thought terrible, for the better progresse of their owne more vniust designes; I do not see, in that small iudgement which my experience hath giuen mee, but the redempti∣on
of that place and people were most facile (being but foure thousand Turkes in the whole Iland) and the glory would bee immortall to the Actor; besides the profite which must needs follow from so great an acquist; and the preseruing of it would also bee of no expence, nor hazard: the peoples affection binding it selfe to their redeemer; besides a necessity to keepe them vnited vnto him by the meanes of so abhorred a neighbour, from whom their vindication, into liberty, must bee maintained by their owne constancy: and his extreme weakenesse by sea, war∣ranting all tranquility from feare of a powrefull inuasion, by which the Conquerour might be put in the least hazard. But God (who in his great iudgement weigheth mans sinnes, and appointeth, forth of his treasury of wrath, scourges for their iniquities) perhaps hath not fully satis∣fied his causefull indignation, yet, with the suffering of that people; and therefore blindeth the eies of the good vnder∣standing, of all his great instruments, whom hee hath rai∣sed in the world to glorifie his name, to administer iustice, and to lighten the burthen of the oppressed, that they should not see the calamites of that Country, nor that their cries should come into their eares, by which their ge∣nerous hearts should be moued to condigne compassion; nor that their iudgements should be free to see their owne particular honour, and profite: So God vseth to show man that hee is a bubble, raised onely by his breath, mouing by the same, and falling by the same, according to the will of his great prouidence, to which we in the pride of our nature, yeeld not the true attribution due vnto it: yet the powerfull working of it is such, that with the confusion of our foolish pride, it proueth it selfe an eternall wisedome, which will giue lawes to the world, and the bridle to all people, and guideth onely the hearts of Princes. From Paphos we went to the Salins in a litle hired barke,A .
where wee found the morizell, in which wee came to Zant. The Portingal, and his complices presently went on shore to the Subbassa of the place (for so is called the go∣uernour there) and told him diuers Pirats, who had lost their Ships, were come into the harbour in a small Boate, amongst whom were some boies, and youths, worth much money; besides, I know not what iewels and treasure wee had amongst vs; with the which he would giue him a good present also, if hee would send some of his Souldiers, and take vs. At this Oration of his, were present certaine Armenian passengers, who had knowne vs in the ship, which moued with the enormity of so vile an act (that Christians should sell and betray Christians to Turkes, and that vpon no cause of offence, which they were witnesses of, wee should be persecuted with such a kind of inhumane cruelty) with all speed possible hired a Boate, themselues, for Alexan∣dretta, came with it vnto vs, prouided in it victuals for vs, and the Maisters themselues to loose no time; and besee∣ched vs, with teares in their eies, to flye from thence with all speed possible; relating vnto vs the scelerattreason con∣spired against vs, and our imminent perill. Wherefore we instantly changed into that Boate, and perceiuing a Fregat a farre off, rowing towards vs, for hast, left most of our things behind vs, and yet could not make so much speed, but that the Ianizaries, which were in the Fregat, and cha∣sed vs, bestowed some shot vpon vs, and had peraduenture ouertaken vs, if the night had not ended their chasing vs, and our dangers. This Boate, in which wee were, was an ordinary passen∣ger betweene Ciprus and Alexandretta, a small way of onely a night and a halfe sayling, and halfe a daies sayling: So that by reason the Maister was vnlike to mistake his way, much lesse so iust contrary as hee did, towards two
houres in the night, we met another passage-Boate, put off from Famagusta, holding the course which wee intended: The night was faire, with the shining of the moone and star∣light; yet, by reason of the difference in sayling, wee first lost sight of that Boate, then by our different course, the Maister of ours, insteed of Alexandretta, going for Tripoly, which, certainely, was a great worke of God to preserue vs. The other Boate, at breake of the day, being taken at the entrance of the port of Alexandretta, by certaine Tur∣kish Pirates, who put all to the sword, that were in it, and hearing of vs, we had rowed so far into the Riuer Orontes, before they could recouer vs, that they durst no further prosecute that prey. There we found a goodly Country, repleat euen natu∣rally with all the blessings the earth can giue to man, for the most part vncultiuated, here and there, as it were, sprin∣kled with miserable Inhabitors, which in their fashion shewed the necessity they had to liue, rather then any plea∣sure in their liuing. From thence wee sent our Interpretor to Antiochia, to prouide vs horses to bring vs thither, which hee returned within two daies after, and with them wee proceeded thi∣ther, full of great care how we should escape from thence: The Turke hauing giuen certaine scales to trade in, out of which, as it was vnlawfull for any to conuerse; so it must needs be an vneuitable perill for so great a company, when the same great Prouidence, which at first defended vs from the former hazards, gaue vs the good hap to meete with two Ianizaries, Hungarish-runnagates, who vnderstanding that we were Christians, compelled against our dispositi∣ons into that place, our intention to be a visitation of Ieru∣salem, and with all our feare of some great preiudice by our being arriued out of the distinguished places for all Chri∣stians; hauing told vs first, that they themselues had beene
Christians, and though they had, for reasons best knowne to themselues, altered that condition; yet they wished well to those which still were so, and especially to all of those parts: and afterwards cheerefully comforting vs, inuited vs to lodge in their house, securing vs, by a number of prote∣stations, from all dangers; which as they courteously offe∣red, so (if I may giue so faire a terme, to such a people) they honourably performed: For being by the Cady of Antiochia required to present vs vnto him, they did not onely deny vs, as bound vnto it by the lawes of hospitality, in respect of their promise, as they themselues said; but called fifty other Ianizaries of Damasco, their friends, to defend vs, if the Cady should haue offered violence. And now that I haue had occasion to speake of the Iani∣zaries of Damasco, which by likely-hood, of that they presu∣med to do in that point, must bee men of great authority, both in power and estimation: It will not bee amisse, to vse so fit an opportunity to discourse of the Turkes whole go∣uernement of those parts, which I did not behold with the eies of a common Pilgrime, or Merchant; which passing onely by goodly Citties and Territories, make their iudge∣ment vpon the superficiall appearance of what they see: but as a Gentleman bred vp in such experience, which hath made me somewhat capable to penetrate into the perfecti∣on and imperfection of the forme of the State, and into the good and ill Orders by which it is gouerned. And though it bee true, that my weakenesse in iudging may rather doe harme then good, to such as will fauour me with too much beleefe; yet it will euer bee a helpe of some feeling to those which know lesse: Our duties being to further all, and chiefly those who haue most need. he course of s Turkes ouernment.The Originall of the Turkes many haue written well of; the maintaining of their state hath bene their Subects true, and deuote adherence to their religion, without
Schisme or Faction; and obedience to their Princes. They increase the same religion also, (which continually instiga∣teth them to the propogation of it) and the reason of their beginning, which was Armes; they, induced by a confi∣dence in them, haue euer desired to vse them. And to de∣taine such a stirring disposition from ciuil dissentions, their Princes haue euer with forraigne enterprises, led them to the exercise of them. The meanes of the preseruation of their States so great, and so many acquisted, haue bene the securest of any other: the Princes personally inhabiting of the most dangerous; and ruinating, and possessing by Colonies actually, though in another name, the rest. So that where the Dominion ioyneth with the power of the Christian Princes; his presence keepeth those parts from danger of innouation: Where hee is further separated, his Tymarri, (which are certaine to whom he distributeth so much land for their desert in vertue, which was their first institution; and by that tenure are bound to finde him their persons, and so many horses in his warres) they, I say, hauing their estates soly depending vpon his gouernment, assuring him from all perill of alteration. And besides, to strengthen himselfe the more, hee hath not onely destroy∣ed the Noble bloud of the Countries; but in most pla∣ces the Citties, Townes and Houses, to remoue from the very memory of men, by the renewing of those spectacles the apprehension of their former condition of liuing: and since the gouernment of those states were so far separated, least the minde of him, to whom he gaue such an admini∣stration, might lift it selfe vp to higher thoughts, he chan∣geth them continually from time, to time, without any pre∣fixed order; and giueth them by the ancient forme, which the vertuouser Princes enacted; but to men of great me∣rite: besides, so dissolueth all strength from their supreme authority in case of absolutenesse, that without a speciall
commission for some speciall cause, the Bassa hath nothing to do with the Souldiory, but those are ordered in their function, by either one Agam or Sarda, the Bashawes ends directing themselues to the ciuill gouernment; from the iust administring of which, they were learned heretofore, by terrible examples, not to decline; their faults being brought speedily to the Court, the emulation of which as speedily presented them to the Prince; the maine point of whose estate droue him to execute rigorous remedies to confirme his awfulnesse and obedience, by which hee did subsist among his Subiects. Those Ianizaries of Damasco, amongst other Garrisons were appointed as those of Cairo against the inuasions of the Arabs: who are, through all those Prouinces, a people dispersed, liuing in Tents, without a certaine place of a∣bode, remoouing their habitations according to the sea∣sons, and their owne commodities: part of which, who are remoued on that side of Euphrates, which is of Mesopota∣mia, now called Diarbeh, are peaceable to the Turke, and not much infestious to Trauellors; their King being a Sa∣niacke of the Turks, and by that title holding Ana and Der, two Townes vpon the Riuer, which pay him his stipend. The other, vpon the other side, towards Egypt, through all Arabia, Petra, and Deserta, and spreding as far as the limits of Arabia Felix; being in multitudes, and not possible bee brought to a quiet and wel-formed manner of liuing, are dangerous to strangers, and continuall spoylers of those parts of the Turkes Dominions, which euery way border vpon them: for the safety of which, as I said, those two gar∣risons of Caeiro, and Damasco were instituted, the first of 12000, the other of 1500 Ianizaries. Neither must it bee thought, since these of Damasco doe not onely defend that part, but are also distributed through other Citties of Soria, As Aleppo, Antiochia, & further in Ierusalem also, that 1500
men are able to sustaine, and answere well to such a charge. But these being both Ianizaries, and by great seruices here∣tofore done, proceeding also to be Tymarrie, haue many followers, which do augment mightely their number, and euery yeare were accustomed (besides those which staied to preserue the countrey) to send great troupes, not onely warlikely, but pompously prouided, into Hungary: but now that through the incapacity of this Prince presently reign∣ing, there are extreame corruptions growne through all the members of his estate: his subiects generally taking example of his weakensse, and particularly his great ones, making their profite thereof. As vertue is generally for∣gotten, so they which haue authority, are so farre from in∣dustriating themselues to replant it, that they, making a commodity of the ill, are euer desirous it should increase, to increase with it their gaine. For as places of gouerne∣ment, and of all sort of administration, were anciently giuen vnto those, who by their worthinesse grew to a condigne estimation with the Prince; This time hath brought things▪ to another condition; that now men are weighed by the aboundance of their fortune, not of their vertue: who buying their authority of the Prince, like Merchants, must make their profite of the people vnder their charge; wherein they rather desire to be vile, base, and offenders, then to haue them of better, fitter, and honester spirits: the gaines being small, if the people were good, by a iust caring for them; and greatest, as they are by punishing, by extortion, and oppression, and also as ill as they are by many wrongs: which the peo∣ple also finding, and withall that mischiefe increaseth, ra∣ther then diminisheth; taking example from so great patternes, adde by those more wickednesse to the badnesse of their owne dispositions. And as they are all made a prey to the greatest, so euery one according to his power, doth
deale with the lesser; like a forrest of wilde beasts, liuing all vpon rapine, without any sence of humanity, more then an appearance. This violent humour in them hath brought disobe∣dience (Couetousnesse, and Luxury, dissoluing the bonds of all respect; our willes euer carrying vs from our selues, from all awfulnesse, and all Lawes, when they are ouer-mai∣stered by those two mighty enemies to perticular men, much more then to generall states,) So that the Princes commandement is no more esteemed in any part, farre re∣moued from his owne presence, then it fitteth with the ho∣nour and profite of him to whom it commeth. From whence haue growne so many and so dangerous rebelli∣ons, so huge wasts in Countries; and caused through all those parts those Ianizaries (which were appointed for the safety of the prouinces, and had their first priuiledges, not onely for a reward to their vertues; but to binde them by such rewardes, to answere the Princes confidence in them) to obey no authority which calleth them to other warres: but by combining themselues in a strength toge∣ther, to tyrannize the Countries committed to their char∣ges: in such a sort, that they are not onely Princes, as it were, ouer the people, but do also terrific the greater Mi∣nisters. And though this be a great weakenesse in the very Basis of so huge an estate (which can by no meanes be held together but by such an vnite compaction as may iustly, and euer moue by the heads intentions; lest it should sway this way, or that way; and so either breake, or bend by his owne great weight, or bruise it selfe, which in so ouer-growne a body must come to dangerous vlcers, where no care is taken for the curing of the parts) Yet it doth not onely shew, that Gods iudgement hath deter∣mined it a short time of continuance, by that one great signe, but by many other: as their negligence of the main∣taining
of a strenth by Sea;; which did (as it were) knit together many great parts of it, farre diuided; and gaue an essentiall strength in force and reputation to his whole state: His want of necessary prouision for the warres in all those parts; not speaking of those for peace, sithence the ruine of the Prouinces, for the most part, and the misery of those poore flocke of people, which doe liue in the parts inhabited, are onely the meanes to giue him peace. Yet the negligence of the Princes Christian will not make vse of these extreame defects of his to amplifie their Dominions, to eternize their Honours; and (that which is the greatest) to glorifie God, which hath made them Princes, onely to execute his iudge∣ments; (none of which now can bee more iustly infli∣cted vpon any, then vpon that great blasphemer against his Holy one, and tyrant of the world) giue peace to their inique passions, which giue cause to the very earth to sigh, to all good hearts to groane, and kindle Gods indignation against them, and their people: and turne first their aspects to that which they owe to God; and then to the true ambition of a Prince, to doe great and iust things; which with their honour might also bring pro∣fite to their present estates; and are of such a condition, that the effecting of them is vtterly without danger, or difficulty: seeing with the very sight of a compleat Ar∣mie, his Souldiary, in those parts, would be terrified, through their inability, to resist; and the people, who can∣not change possible to worse fortune, would all follow those Ensignes, which their extremity doth already force them to wish for. And let all iudgement, giue themselues but a small time of truce, with other passions; and wee shall see, not onely what shame it is to the very Name of Christianity, to suffer that great Sepulcher of our Re∣demption to bee possessed, to our eternall ignominy, by his
professed enemies, who vouchsafed to giue his deerest bloud, to buy vs from perdition. Religion is that which euer moueth the blindest hearts of men to the most resolute enter∣prises.: and an awfull loue hath euer beene the strongest band to binde men to their Princes, to their Countrey, and to common society. Romulus, when his people fled before the Sabines; so that the victory shewed it selfe vndoubtedly on their side, and ouerthrow on his: the very remembring them of leauing Iupiter, and the rest of the Gods in the Capitoll, to the possession of their enemies, was sufficient to turne that desperate fortune. And when the French had sacked and burnt a great part of Rome; the same awfull reuerence to their Gods, and loue to their Countrey, could binde them rather to re-build their ruinated Citty, then to go to Vejes, a Towne ready, and magnificently builded. But we can leaue, in the Turkes possession, not onely the Coun∣trey of our Sauiour, (which should be deerer vnto vs then our owne, for his great name sake;) but this the Sepulcher of his precious bloud, which he gaue freely an oblation, to giue vs, by that sacrifice, that which is aboue all, eternall life; without compunction of loue or Religion. So much are our hearts hardened against the appearing mercies of God, which hath made him for a great, a weake enemy; to giue vs corage by such an vnhoped fore-signe, to produce that supreme act of our duties. Where are those gene∣rous spirits of the fore-passed Princes, and men; which a∣gainst all humane reason, to reuenge iniuries, and wrongs done to the holy name of God, thrust themselues into most dangerous enterprises, onely trusting in the true wor∣thinesse of their cause, which they iudged God would mi∣raculously prosper; being vndertaken with so good and true hearts for him? The successes of which also, we may reade to haue beene most prosperous: God striuing in
mercy with mans intentions: And though it be true, that the dayes of Visions, and such apparant Miracles are fi∣nished; yet let vs not, by too great precisenesse, mistake the things which indeed are: but take this for a great miracle, in regard of our manifold sinnes, which deserue all bitter vengeance, and no good; that God yet hath pleased, (whilst we deuoure one another in this poore small; flocke of Gods Church; and by our cruelly resoluing to our ciuill destruction, do open the breach for the common enemy) to enlarge his power and greatnesse by his onely breath to shake him with such infection, that his ouerthrow is most facille, if we will vse the time pointed vnto vs by his merci∣full finger: which also may turne vnto vs as heauy a iudge∣ment, if we do not, with the best councell, and most desi∣rous affection of our hearts, and soules, embrace the beames of his compassion. But since Princes hearts are in the hands of God, and he turneth them either for their own chastisements, or for those of the people, to a certaine secret point of direction, from the which they can∣not diuert; as those which are too great iudgements for me to penetrate into, I will leaue them, and speake of my Ianizaries rare disposition vnto me; who did not onely performe their promise in defending me in Antiochia; but deliuered me safely from them into our English Consuls hands in Aleppo: from whom, and from all the Merchants there abiding, I receiued such an entertainment, with so carefull, so kinde, and so honourable a respect, as I must needs say, they were the onely Gentlemen, or the most benigne Gentlemen that euer I met withall: For my com∣pany being so great, that it was no light burthen vnto them; besides, gaue an occasion to the Turkes condition of getting to make quarrels for that end: so that they were not onely at expence by defraying me and mine; but at more by preseruing vs from oppression amongst them. I
had not beene fully one moneth expecting a commodity of passage by carrauan into Persia: but that the Morizell arriued, who presently had the aduice of my being at A∣leppo: And though that Hugo de Potso threatned as much as an ill mind, and great purse could make him hope to pre∣uaile against me by; and questionlesse had raised some great trouble against me,happy dli∣rance from ger. if he had come safe to Aleppo: Yet euer the first prouidence, which saued me before, deter∣mined so well also for me then, that foure miles from A∣leppo he dyed: By which meanes I was preserued from pe∣rill; and those honest Merchants, my friends, from great trouble. Neither do I speake of these strange escapings with a vaine ostentation of pride, as though I would haue the world iudge more of my person, then of a most ordi∣ry fellow; but onely to example to other how much it pleaseth God to fauour good intentions: that those which put themselues into the worlds dangers, may euer arme themselues with them, as the onely preseruatiue against all sort of Inconueniences. For though in the corruption of our nature generally, and weakenesse of our faith, wee cannot possibly hope to be defended by such a strong working hand, as God vseth for the safety of his Saints: yet no question good in∣tentions haue such a sympathy with Gods owne disposition, that he will both assist them which haue them, for their better in∣couragement, and for others example, being one of the chiefe means by which he instructeth the world. After 6 weeks stay∣ing in Aleppo (a wearisome time to my selfe, being drawne from thence continually by the instigation of my desire, which longed for the accomplishment of the end, that I proposed to my selfe: and as chargeable a time for my friends, which would needs make me a burthensome guest vnto them) the Tafterdall, which is the Treasurer, and the great Cady, which is, as it were, the Lord chiefe Iustice of Babylon, arriued at Aleppo, from thence to go by the riuer of
Euphrates to the place of their regiment. With those, as di∣uers others went, so did I also, for the more security of my voyage (their company being euer defended, besides with the respect of their persons, with a good company of Ia∣nizaries) to Birr, which is the place of imbarkment. Di∣uers of our Merchants brought me, and left me not vntill I was boated. Thirty dayes we were going vpon the riuer to Babylon, resting euery night by the shore side: In all which way we found few townes; onely Racha, Ana, Derrit, and o∣therwise as little habitation, except here and there a small village: and one of better reputation, which is the landing place, thirty miles from Babylon, called Phalugium. To tell wonders, of things I saw, strange to vs, that are borne in these parts, is for a Traueller of another profession then I am, who had my end to see, and make vse of the best things; not to feed my selfe, and the world, with such trifles, as ei∣ther by their strangenesse, might haue a suspition of vn∣truth: or by their lightnesse adde to the rest of my imperfe∣ctions, the vanity, or smallnesse of my iudgement. But be∣cause I was desirous to certifie my selfe truly of the estate of the Turke in those parts, through which I passed, vnder∣standing, where wee lodged one night, that the Campe of Aborisci, King of those Arabies, which inhabite the de∣sert of Messopotamia, was a mile off; I hazarded my selfe in that curiosity, to go into it; and saw a poore King with a ten or twelue thousand beggerly subiects, liuing in tents of blacke haire-cloth: yet so well gouerned, that though our clothes were much better then theirs, and their want might haue made them apt ynough to haue borrowed them of vs; we passed notwithstanding, through them all in such peace, as we could not haue done, being strangers, amongst ciueller bred people. That day, as it happened, was the day of Iustice amongst them, which was pretty, and warlike: Certaine chiefe
Officers of the Kings, mounting on horse-backe; armed after their maner, with their staues, targets, bowes, and ar∣rows; and so giuing iudgment of all cases which the peo∣ple brought before them. The King gaue vs good words, without any kinde of barbarous wondring, or other dis∣tastfull fashion. But when wee returned to our boat, wee found the maister of his house, maister of our boat; with a sort of his Arabs: and in conclusion, we were forced to send his maister three verstes of cloth of gold, for behol∣ding his person. This is that King of the Arabs, which I said before, was a Saniake of the Turkes; and for that place held of the Turke, Ana, and Dirr, two Townes vpon the riuer. As soone as we came to Babylon, hauing put the stocke which I had all into Iewels, and Merchandize, to carry the fashion of a Merchant; at the Dogna, which is the Cu∣stome-house, all (whatsoeuer) was stayed for the Bassa: and (as I perceiued) not so much for any great vse which hee meant to make of those things; as for the suspition which he had of me, and mine extraordinary company bearing much cause thereof with it; and because I gaue out I had more goods coming with the carrauan by land, to bind me not to start from thence. In the meane time, by very neces∣sity, hauing left me nothing in the world; what extreme af∣fliction I was in, by that means, for the present; and in what iust cause of feare for the future, euery man may easily iudge. I had my brother with mee, a yong Gentleman; whose affection to me, had onely led him to that disaster; and the working of his owne vertue: desiring in the begin∣ning of his best yeares, to inable himselfe to those things, which his good minde raised his thoughts vnto. I had also fiue and twenty other, Gentlemen, for the most part: the rest, such as had serued me long; onely carried with their loues to mee, into the couse of my fortune.
I had no meanes to giue them sustenance to liue,A hard di∣stresse. and lesse hope to vnwrap them from the horrible snare, into which I had brought them; being farre from all friends, and further from counsell, not vnderstanding the lan∣guage of the people, into whose hands I was falne; much lesse their proceedings: onely thus much I knew, they were Turkes, inhumane in their natures, and adicted to get by all meanes iust, and vniust. But I will leaue my selfe a little in that great straight; and speake of Babylon; not to the intent to tell stories, either of the huge ruines of the first Towne, or the splendor of this second: but because nothing doth impresse any thing in mans nature more, then example, to shew the truth of Gods word, whose vengeance, threatned by his Prophets, are truely succeeded in all those parts; which were once so swolne with the pride of the greatnesse of their state, which they possessed, with their felicity, their mag∣nificencie, and their riches; that as they were the heads of the world, by their power, and by their excellency; so were they, by that opinion in themselues, blowne vp to a conceipt of eternity: As though any earthly foundation, let it be grounded neuer so firmely vpon councell, vpon force and reputation, could possibly be perpetuall. Niniuy (that which God himselfe calleth, that great Citty) hath not one stone standing, which may giue the memory of the being of a Towne: one English mile from it, is a place called Mosul, a small thing; rather to bee a witnesse of the others mightinesse, and Gods iudgement, then of any fashion of Magnificency in it selfe. All the ground on which Babylon was spred, is left now desolate, nothing standing in that Peninsula, betweene the Euphrates and the Tigris, but onely part, and that a small part, of the great Tower; which God hath suffred to stand (if man may speake so confidently of his great impenetrable Counsels)
for an eternall testimony of his great worke in the confu∣sion of mans pride; and that Arke of Nebuchadnezar, for as perpetuall a memory of his great idolatry, and con∣digne punishment: nothing else shewing the figure of any thing, which hath bene, either of ornament, or of great∣nesse, or of place inhabited: So truely doth God iudge the huge sinnes of the world, and maintaineth so iustly the cre∣dit of his Messengers; that though they speak great things, they neuer speake vaine things. The Towne, which is now called Bagdat, and is on the other side of Tigris, towards Persia (onely a small suburbe in the Peninsula) but remoued from any stirpe of the first; to which men passe ordinarily by a bridge of Boates, which euery night is dissolued, for feare either of the Arabs, or some storme vpon the Riuer, which might carry away the Boates, when there were no helpe ready. The buildings are after the Morisco fashion, low, without sto∣ries; and the Castle, where the Bassa is resident, is a great vaste place, without beauty or strength, either by Art, or Nature; the people some-what more abstinent from offen∣ding Christians, then in other parts, through the necessity of the trade of Ormus: vpon which standeth both the per∣ticular, and publique wealth of that State. Victuals are most aboundant, and excellent good of all sorts, and very cheape; which was a mighty blessing for Mee, which had nothing but a generall wardrope of cloaths,ard di∣esse. not in our Coffers, but vpon our backes; which wee were forced to make mony of by peece-meale, according to the falling of the lot, and our necessity; and with that liued: and if feeding-well had bene all, which wee had cause to care for, we also liued well. But after one month was past, and time fastned euery mans eies more firmely vpon vs;strange pre∣ence. One day a Florentine Merchant (whom I had onely knowne in the way betweene Aleppo and Babylon by a riding acquain∣tance)
came vnto mee, and after a little other discourse, told me, that there was a great muttering amongst diuers great men there, what I was, and what my designes might bee; that hee found me to bee dangerously spied after: and wished me to haue regard, (if not to my selfe) yet to so many, which he did imagine were impawned in that mis∣fortune by my meanes. And though it were true, that hee came vpon the motion of an honest, pious, and charitable heart; yet I was so fearefull of an Italian Merchant, that I did rather imagine him to be the spy, then lightly to haue bene an instrument of his preuention. Therefore agreeing with him in the complement onely, I answered determi∣nately in the rest; that I knew no iust cause of perill, there∣fore I feared none; and if there were any curious eies vp∣on me, because of the number of my company, the Cara∣uan comming, they should see good vse made of them all: and vntill that time I would haue patience with their loo∣king and speaking. Him I thanked for his kindnesse, and offered my selfe largely vnto him, as though I had least suspected him; though in truth I did most: and most vniust∣ly. For, two daies after hee returned to me againe, and as a man moued in his very soule with anguish, told mee that within ten daies, the Carauan of Aleppo would arriue; in the meane time, beseeched mee, not to couer my selfe longer from him, who did truely wish me well, not so much for my person (which hee could know little) but because his conceipt was, that I would not haue hazarded my selfe in such a iourney, but for some great end, which he did be∣leeue well of; and besides, in charity to a Christian, and so many Christians with me: saying, that there was a Carauan of Persian Pilgrimes, arriued two daies since from Mecca without the Towne, who were forced to take that way (though the longest) by reason of the Plague, which raig∣ned very exceedingly in those places, by which they
should haue passed.strange and traordinary ndnesse of a orentine. He was not ignorant of my wants, for which hee also had prouided; and taking me by the hand, beseeched me againe to beleeue him, and to go presently with him to the carrauan: which I did, not being able to answere, through admiration of so generous a part in him, and an amazement, with a thousand diuers thoughts spred vpon me. When I came there he brought me to a Vitto∣rin, of whom he had already hired Horses, Camels, and Moiles for me; and I found a Tent pitched by his seruants: and then opening his gowne, hee deliuered me a bag of Chakins, with these very words: The God of heauen blesse you, and your whole company, and your enterprise, which I will no further desire to know, then in my hope, which perswadeth mee that it is good; My selfe am going to China, whence if I returne, I shall little need the repay∣ment of this courtesy, which I haue done you with a most free heart; if I die by the way, I shall lesse neede it: But if it please God so to direct both our safeties with good prouidence, that we may meete againe, I assure my selfe, that you will remember mee to bee your friend; which is enough, for all that I can say to a man of your sort. And almost, without giuing me leasure to yeeld him condigne thanks (if any thankes could be condigne) for so great and so noble a benefite, he departed from me: And as I heard afterward from him by letters from Ormus, hee receiued much trouble after my departure, through his honourable desire to perfect the kindnesse which hee had begone. For imagining, that by the continuall spies, which claue to my house, that my flight could not be secret: he had no soo∣ner left mee in the Carauan, but that hee changed his lod∣ging to mine, saying that I had done the like to his; and went to the Cady, telling him that I was sicke, desiring his Physition to visite mee, knowing well enough that the Cady had none, but onely to giue colour to my not
appearing in the Towne: The Cady answered, he was sorry for my sickenesse, and would send to the Bassa for his Physition, which Signior Victorio Speciero (for so was this honourable Florentine called) would by no meanes; ho∣ping, as he said, that my sickenesse would not bee so great, as would require the trouble of his Highnesse. By this meanes fiue daies passed before I was missed; and when I was once discouered to bee gone, Fifty Ianizaries were sent after mee, to bring mee backe againe: the carauan ha∣uing diuided it selfe by the way, whereof one part went a visitation of a Santon in the deserts of Samarone; & the other passed the right way for Persia, by the Mountaines gouer∣ned by a Prince of the Courdines, called Cobatbeague. The Ianizaries hearing of them to be past, and thinking that all had bene so they returned: and that noble-minded Floren∣tine was forced to pay fiue hundred Crownes, to make his peace with the Bassa. And though it bee a miserable thing for a man to grow an example in cases of affliction, yet it is necessary that some men should be so; and because it pleaseth God, that I should bee one, and a great one of these: So I may also be taken, for as great a one of his infinite mercies, and through them his direct pleasure in what sort, hee will haue men gouerne themselues. For hauing fastened my mind to that good purpose, and intermingled some particular intentions of mine owne ambitions: as God shewed a sensible disposition to fauour the one; so by hum∣bling me to the very pit of extremities, he taught me to cast away the other; and to haue my sole confidence in him, disposing my minde to his pleasure; not to the coun∣sell of my owne frailty, which founded in the perfectest man, moueth to continuall errours: not that man doth not more desire to intend good then euill, by a naturall reason, (vertue being the health of the mind, and vice the
sickenesse, and all natures abhorring sickenesse, and the destruction of nature. But the great enemy of man-kind cousoneth our weakenesse with a shadow, and coulour of good, in the very extremest ills; and so induceth vs to em∣brace, and desire, them masked in the appearance of good: The true effect of which we afterward feele in the despe∣rate working of the poison, when it hath (for want of due prouision) so possessed our vitall parts, that were left both to our selues, and to the world, (to whose benefite the ver∣tues and good parts of good men are appropriated) and (that which is most) to God; which is the great, and onely good, to which the end of our life is, or ought to bee di∣rected. Neither must man thinke that for many burthens, which God layeth vpon him, that hee is wholy abandoned, and so leape from an awfull humility to a direct despaire of his mercies: Since God, like a great Prince, will haue men his Subiectes, so truely his, that all their thoughts shall depend vpon his autho∣rity, and not vpon the swolne bubbles of their owne hearts. which if they erre in, humility is the true reconciliation of their offence, before that great Iudge: and desperation, a mani∣fest token of a maine rebellious spirit; which, reposed vpon a vaine assurance of himselfe, plungeth him in that extre∣mity, vpon the contrary proceeding of his intentions: which are so farre from power to effect themselues by any ability in himselfe, that himselfe can no longer subsist, then Gods proui∣dence is hee should. Finally, God is not as man, whom we may abuse, by hauing diuers propositions mingled of good and bad ends: the bookes of our hearts being laid open before him, in which he readeth our most inward thoughts; for which wee must continually giue an account, feeling the reward of our good motions by the mag∣nificency of his mercies and our bad by the infliction of ca∣lamites; which wee may auoide, if wee will vnderstand God
and our selues; which we may euer do by making the best vse of the wisedome which wee haue borne in our selues; by learning of other; and exercitation; which are the acquisters of all Sciences: amongst all which, none is so great in it selfe, nor so greatly importing man. And though many, in the mis-vnder∣standing of the world, are acounted learned and wise without it; let them know, that such are like vntimely fruite, which carry with them a temporall wonder, raised through the ig∣norance of other, which put no distinction betweene the effects of the world, and the workings of God, when there is so great a one, as permanency in the last, and no more but apparition in the other, shewing it selfe, and dissoluing without, almost, any memory, that any such thing was: which should make the iudgement of men not to proceed to their absolutenesse, by be∣holding the present fortune of any; but first see the end which God hath appointed him vnto; and then to giue a diffinitiue sentence; in which they cannot erre, drawing their iudgement from his, who neuer erreth. Of most part of which things (as I said) I may bee a most present, and a most certaine ex∣ample, both of the mutablenesse of fortunes workings, of the causes, (which I confesse freely) of Gods infinite mer∣cies, and of his order of gouernement, vnder which hee disposeth mens actions. And though I had, through the sencible apprehensions of such great lessons, giuen mee by so diuers iudgements, throwne away all other opini∣ons, then those, which had their aspects onely turned to the promotion of his glory: Yet my frailty gaue me a con∣tinuall terrour during those thirty daies in which we wan∣dred with that company of blind Pilgrimes through the Deserts; not knowing what God had wrought for my secu∣rity, and those which were with mee, by that good man, Signior Vittorio. At the end of which wee arriued in the King of Persia's dominions, hauing first passed a great tract of good and ill Countries, the desert places of which be∣ing
onely sand, gaue no meanes for inhabitants to liue: the fruitfuller parts were vsed by certaine people, called Cour∣dines, liuing in Tents, knowing no other fruit of the earth, but what belonged to the sustenance of their cattell, vpon the milke, butter, and flesh, of which they liue, ruled by certaine particular Princes of their owne, which giue partly an obedience to the Turke, and part to the Persian, as they are neerest the Confines of the one or the other. Yet in that simplicity of liuing (not being without that contagion of all Mankind, of all Prouinces, and of all States, ambition of getting superiority, and larger Domi∣nion) some wars daily grow in amongst them, euen to the extirpation of a whole Nation: As wee found freshly, when wee passed by one of those Princes, called Hider∣beague, all whose people were deuored by the sword, or carried away captiue, by Cobatbeague: and himselfe remai∣ned, onely with some twenty soules, in certaine poore Holdes in a Rocke. The precise summe, which I receiued of the Florentine, I set not downe, to preuent the scandales of diuers, who measuring euery mans mind by the straightnesse of theirs, will beleeue no act, which doth not symbolize with them∣selues: but so much it was, that being thirty daies vpon the way to the Confines; then fifteene from the Confines to Casbine, where wee attended one month the Kings ar∣riuall; it was not onely sufficient to giue vs aboundant meanes for that time, but to cloth vs all in rich appa∣rell, fit to present our selues before the presence of any Prince, and to spend extraordinarily in giftes, by which wee insinuated farre into the fauour of those, which had the authority of that Prouince, during our abode, and expectation of the Kings comming: In which time wee were well vsed, more by the opinion, which they had, that the King would take satisfaction by
vs, then by their owne humors; being an ill people in them∣selues; and onely good by the example of their King, and their exceeding obedience vnto him. The Gouernour visi∣ted me once; Marganabeague, maister of the Kings house, (whom I had won vnto me by presents) came oftentimes to see me: besides (as it seemed) being more inwardly ac∣quainted with the Kings inclination, fitted himselfe more to that, then others did, which knew it lesse. And now that Iam in Persia, & speak of the kings absence; since he is both one of the mightiest Princes that are, and one of the excellētest, for the true vertues of a Prince, that is, or hath bin; and hauing come to this greatnesse, though by right; yet through the circumstances of the time, & the occasions, which then were, solely his owne worthinesse, & vertue, made way to his right: besides, the fashion of his gouernmēt differing so much from that which we call bar∣barousnesse, that it may iustly serue for as great an Idea for a Principality, as Platoes Common-wealth did for a Go∣uernment, of that sort. I hold it not amisse to speake amply first of his person, the nature of his people, the distribution of his gouernment; the administration of his iustice, the condition of the bordering Princes, & the causes of those warres, in which he was then occupied; that by the true ex∣pression of those, this discourse may passe with a more liue∣ly, and more sensible feeling. His person then is such, as a well-vnderstanding Nature would fit for the end proposed for his being, excellently well shaped, of a most well proportioned stature, strong, and actiue; his colour somewhat inclined to a man-like blacknesse, is also more blacke by the sunnes burning: his furniture of his mind infinitly royall, wise, valiant, liberall, temperate, mercifull, and an exceeding louer of Iustice, embracing royally others vertues, as farre from pride and vanity, as from all vnprincely signes, or acts; knowing his
power iustly what it is; and the like acknowledgement will also haue from others, without any gentilitious adorati∣on; but with those respects, which are fit for the maiesty of a Prince; which foundeth it selfe vpon the power of his state, general loue, and awfull terror. His fortunes determi∣ning to make proofe of his vertue, draue him (in his first yeares) into many dangerous extremities; which he ouer∣comming by his vertue, hath made great vse of, both in the excellent increase of his particular vnderstanding, and ge∣nerall tranquility, strength of his countrey, & propagation of his Empire. For the lawes, and customes, or both, of that kingdome, being such, that though the king haue a large increase of Issue, the first borne only ruleth; & to auoyd all kind of cause of ciuill dissention, the rest are not inhuman∣ly murthered, according to the vse of the Turkish gouern∣ment, but made blind with burning basons: & haue other∣wise all sort of contentment and regard fit for Princes children. Xa-Tamas King of Persia dying without Issue, Xa Codabent, his brother, was called blinde to the king∣dome; who had Issue, Sultan Hamzire Mirza the eldest, who succeeded him, and this present King called Abas. In the fathers time Sinan Basa began the enterprise of Persia (which the Turkes euer reserue in their times of peace with the Christians, to keepe their souldiary in acti∣on, and their armes from rusting) Before he could attempt any important action, hee was called to the port, and ad∣uanced to be principall Viseire: and Mustapha Bassa was appointed his successor, whose industry and valour was ac∣cōpanied with good fortune, in a short space taking Van∣nes and Tiphelis, two strong fortresses, & importing much for the entrance of Scieruan; which he with the like felicity conquered. Notwithstanding Synan taking aduantage of some sinister accident, happened him by ouer-sight (which is euer most incident to those which sway all things with a
happy course of fortune) and being his enemy, bea∣ring his suppositions also against him, by the strength of his authority, caused him to be re-called in the faire course of his victory; and being within some few dayes trauell of Constantinople, whether the cause grew from the pride of his heart, which despised to liue after such an iniury recei∣ued from his enemy, whose fortune being so great, gaue him neither meanes, nor hope of reuenge; or else for feare of death & disgrace together, at the Port, he poisoned him∣selfe. Into whose place was aduanced Osman Bassa, a great Souldier (borne of that Mamaluckes bloud, who had been last Sultan of Egypt) in great estimation with the ge∣neralty of the Turkes, and as much with the Prince him∣selfe; not only through his owne valour, which in truth did merit it; but by his mothers fauour, who was great with the Prince, and with the Sultana his mother. He instantly ac∣quitted all disorders growne, either by the death or negli∣gence of Mustapba; and intending vtterly to subdue all Per∣sia, and to extinguish the reigne of the Sophies; iudging that the shortest way was to begin with the best parts, went presently against Tauris: and though he were long impea∣ched from taking of it, both by the resolute valour of the Defendants, which was all the obstacle in the place, the walles being only of mud, without art, or strength, and by continual attempts of the king of Persia, sometimes in per∣son (though he saw nothing) but most by his eldest son to succour it: Finally after many victories, and sometimes losses, his fortune concurring with his obstinate resoluti∣on, he got the place; in which he had no sooner established a meet garrison, and an order of gouernment in the coun∣trey about it, which followed the fortune of the place; but hauing all his care fixed vpon his designe, for the through accomplishment of his prosperous begun victory, he also died, as it is said, poysoned by Cicala. Whiles the mother
cried out at the port for iustice; and the ambition of other competitors for so great a place; and so large a breach, al∣ready made to enter into honour by; the time ran so far in length, that the peace brake between the Emperour & the Turke, and the warres reuiued in Hungary: so that the age of the king of Persia, his being broken with those first trou∣bles, and suspition of intestine, answering iust to the desire of the Turke; there was a truce concluded betweene those two potentates vpon no other condition; But that each should be contented with that they had. The eldest son of the king remained at the Court of his father, administring all that, which his fathers defect of light vnabled him to doe. Abas the second sonne, twelue yeares of age, vnder the go∣uernment of Tutors, held the prouince of Yasde; and (as Courts are full of rumors, and suspition neuer wanteth in Princes, especially which haue such imperfections, as they are cōpelled to take knowledge of) the vertues of Abas, by which he bound to him the hearts of his prouincials, spred themselues further, and so to the Court; where they were increased to such a condition, as altered the father, & bro∣thers reioycing in them, to an opinion that his winning of the affections of the people, proceeded not from any o∣ther worthinesse, but artifice; which had the intent of it stretching to the Crowne: which tooke such hold in the fthers mind, worne with age, and griefe, and sore with his late misfortunes, that hee resolued secretly his death: The newes of which being brought to Abas speedily by the meanes of secret friends, not onely to himselfe, but to his Gouernors (which as they were the greatest of the state, so they were not vnfriended in the Court) being so farre from any such designe, that he had no sort of prouision at hand to defend himselfe; he fled to the king of Corasan, a coun∣trey of the Tartars, limiting vpon the east of Persia, euer in∣festu o us to that state, not more in their owne disposition,
(being a people giuen to spoile, vnquiet, and which cannot liue in rest) then through their depēdance vpon the Turke, whose religion they professe, (which the Persians do not, but much altered) and whose petnionaries they were, by which they were bound in all seasons, when the Turke was tied to the Christians wars, to diuert the Persian from loo∣king to the commodity of such a time; besides, on occasi∣ons, the Turke vsed to transport great forces of them ouer the Caspian sea into Siruana; and from thence passed them into Hungary; either the longer way by land, or the shorter by sea, ouer Negropont. To this king Abas was exceeding welcome, and cherished, and honored like his owne sonne. Shortly after the flight, the father died, and Sultan Hamzire Mirza, his sonne, succeeded him, who renued the truce with the Turke, through the necessity which he had to vse the most, which his strength and power could yeeld him, to suppresse a great rebellion of the Turcomans: whom, at the last, he so brake with diuers battels, and all other sort of af∣flictions, that they deliuered him vp their Princes, and then themselues. Their Princes he beheaded, and of them, slue twenty thousand of the ablest for the warres, assuring his peace with them by their extremest ruine; and as he was, by all reports, a most braue, & warlike Prince, hauing pacified his owne state, and desirous to recouer, not onely what was freshly lost; but all which was formerly taken from the So∣phies kingdome, by the power of the Ottomans; vnited all his thoughts, and all his Councels to that one great end; which all finished with his life, ending it selfe by treason of his Princes (not without perswasion of the Turke) when he had fit yeares, mind, and courage; and meanes ioined with ocasiō, to haue made himselfe the greatest Prince of many ages: all which though they made his death miserable, yet the manner was more miserable; being vilely slaine by his Barber, retiring halfe drunke from a banquet, to which he
was prouoked by the conspirators, which presently parted the state between them; euery man making himselfe abso∣lute Prince of those prouinces, which they had in gouern∣ment; and parting the royall treasure amongst them for their reciprocall maintenance, disposed themselues vnitely to resist the comming in of Abas; whom notwithstanding they did not much feare, hauing promise of the Turke that he should be detained in Corassan where he was refuged: & knowing that he had neither men nor money, nor years to giue him any incoragement to attempt against them, who had soone confirmed themselues, both with giuing good satisfaction to the people, and with liberality to the Souldiary; and their entrance into the state being without opposition, and so, without offence, made the foundation both more sure and more facile. The Turkes Councell also was exceeding good for his ends; for hauing dissipated the vnite power of that great dominion into so many branches, which though he knew could continue together to maintaine their wrong against the true kings right; yet that their owne ambitions in short time would stirre them to debate amongst themselues: by which, as he was out of doubt of perill, during the trauels of his warres, so he was assured that at his conuenient oc∣casion, either by their owne quarrels, or by his power, they should be all subiected to him. Abas in the meane time, whose iust Title made him king, assured himselfe that both the murder of his brother, and this parting of the state, had the Turkes counsell concur∣ring with those Princes impiety: and not doubting but the king of Corasan was also perswaded to deteine him, resol∣ued notwithstāding by his necessity, began to deale boldly with him for his assistance against his rebels, laying before him how preiuditiall the example was to all Princes; and most to him who was chiefe of all those Tartar Princes, ra∣ther
by their voluntary election, then his states surpassing them in power; that as ambitions were vnlimited general∣ly, so were they euer most in those, which had most pow∣er to vse them largely; that all the states of the Tartars were held by great Princes, and absolute, which had obey∣ed him so long, rather because they would, then they could do no other. If this rebellion of naturall subiects procee∣ded to a happy course, much more would they bee anima∣ted to do the like which were Lords, and no subiects: be∣sides, though the counsell of the Turke had not palesated it selfe openly, yet in all iudgement it might be perceiued, that he had onely raised this, as a Pageant, to fill the world with gazing, whilest hee fitted his designes to impatronize himselfe of the state; which if he should do, how terrible a neighbour he would be to the King of Corassan, he submit∣ted to his wise consideration. For himselfe, that he had bin so bound to him in his first calamity, that without other re asons, he did not doubt but the same royall and gene∣rous spirit, which moued him then to take compassion of him, would also moue him to the like now: And the more, hauing greater hopes of meanes for a gratefull acknow∣ledgement from him; which hee which had the manage∣ment so long of his disposition could not doubt of; and if he had begun to perswade him with other reasons, hee did it rather in the duty of a true friend, to lay before him his owne interest, then in any diffidence of his free inclination to his good. Whereupon the king of Corasan, though pre-occupied by the Turke, yet desirous to bee his friend a farre off, and also doubting the successe of Abas, nei∣ther hauing yeares, nor experience, nor friends; In fine, beeing destitute of all reasonable hope, not to moue the Turks displeasure vpon such a disaduantagious condition, was notwithstanding contented to see whether something might be moued by such a helpe as should not appeare to
giuen by him, but rather voluntary followers of Abas his fortune: hee gaue him three thousand horse onely to put him in possession of that state, which by his vertue, and fortune, is growne now so great, that it hath deuoured all the states of the Tartars, extended it selfe so farre as Cabull to the East; the Arabian gulfe downe to Ballsarack on the South; within three dayes iourney of Babylon on the West; and to Tauris on the North; embracing the whole circumference of the Caspian sea vnto Astracan, which is the vttermost of the Moscouites Dominion, and Seruane of the Turkes, which lyeth vpon that sea: an Em∣pire so great, so populous, & so aboundant; that as it may compare with most of the greatest that euer were, so is it terrible to the Turkes, which is the greatest that now is; though I doe thinke verily, That in Asia the Persian hath as great an extent of Territories, as the Turke, and bet∣ter inhabited, better gouerned, and in better obedience, and affection, I am sure he hath. With this small troope, the King of Persia, guided by his infinite Royall cou∣rage, entred Persia. But as those which are wicked, are euer so well instructed in the Art of their profession, that they neuer want instruments in themselues to deuise, and in others to act those counsels which must euer bee waking, to maintaine what they haue gotten by their sceleratenesse: So their Spyes hastened, with such diligence, to giue those Rebels notice, of their Kings beeing on foote, that the next of them to him, had time to arme great forces, and incountred him in a Prouince, called Si∣stane: and though his inuincible spirit, without any sparke of feare, made him aduenture to fight vpon so vn-equall termes, as was three thousand against twen∣ty thousand; hee found by his experience, that Maie∣sty and right, is nothing without power to beare them vp: and that no exquisite vigour of the minde, can resist the vio∣lence
of sinister fortune, nor oppression of many hands. Yet did fortune so much care (for so great vertue) that shee gaue him way to escape to to the Mountaines, all the rest of the small troupe being cut in peeces. This victory assured the Rebels (as they thought) from all further danger; supposing that these small forces, were all, which then their King could, or hereafter should bee able to lead against them: Imagining that the King of Cor∣rasan, if hee would haue succored him indeed, that hee would neuer haue cast a way those few, to increase the strength of their foundation, and to diminish the others reputation, which is so effectuall in a not well confirmed Princes first actions, especially in a Prince who must come to his right by his vertue and fortune. But the King of Per∣sia, whose owne minde euer comforted him, with a stedfast assurance of his greatnesse, to which hee is now growne, hauing recouered the Mountaines, liued amongst the Heardes-men for three months, vnknowne, changing con∣tinually, from place to place, without any certaine abode, accompanied onely with ten or twelue followers, which were of his first Gouernours, and other yong Gentlemen brought vp with him from his child-hood. But being now no longer able to temporize with his great desire, resoluing to proue the last, and the vttermost of his fortune, and remembring how much loue and affe∣ction those of Yasd had shewed towards him in the time of his gouerning them, and how much he had truely de∣serued of them, determined to shew himselfe in that Pro∣uince; and proue what effect the Maiesty of his person, the iustice of his cause, and former obligation would worke in them: which, though it were a foundation proued euer false, almost by all experiences, The peoples affections euer raising mens hopes, and ruining their persons: Yet it proued otherwise with this King; who was no sooner cer∣taine
knowne in those parts, but numbers of people came flocking to him, armed and appointed for the wars: in such sort, that before any prouision could bee made against him (this being an accident so farre remoued from all sort of suspition) he had a power together, too strong to be easily suppressed; which was no sooner heard by Fer∣rat Can, a great Prince, and discontented with the alte∣ration of the gouernement (to whose share none of that partition had falne, his fortune being such, that at the time of the other Kings death, he had none of the Prouinces to administer, and they were parted onely betweene them, which held them) he I say, with his brother, and a compa∣ny of some ten thousand, came and ioyned themselues to the forces of the King. Neither were the men so welcome, as that Ferrat Can, being a wise Prince, and a great Soul∣dier, grew a party, and such as the King also stood in need of: Neither did the King loose any sort of opportunity, but hearing of the Assembly which certaine of the Princes were making in the neerest Prouinces vnto him, with all speed fell vpon them, and ouer-throwing them followed them as farre as Casbin. In the meane time, those of Shyras, Asphaan, Cassan as∣sisted by the Kings of Gheylan, and Mazandran, gather mighty forces; the Turkes armed at Tauris, and the Prince of Hamadan, hauing called in a strength of the Courdiues, to his assistance, was marching also towards Casbin: So that the King was likely to be so inclosed with all these Ar∣mies, that his first victory would rather haue proued a snare to his intrapment; then important, as he hoped, to the some of his affaires: Whence he resolued to helpe, with Art, that which he was much too weake to accomplish by strength. Wherefore he leaueth Ferrat Can, in Casbin with some fiue thousand men, accompanied with Zulpher his brother; and himselfe, with the rest of his power marched
towards the Can of Hamadane. Ferrat Can, accor∣ding to the deliberation taken betweene the King and him, thewed himselfe altered from the Kings part, wri∣teth to the Rebels, which were all, in a grosse, aduanced as farre, as the mid-way betweene Cassan and Casbin, and offereth not onely to ioyne that strength which hee had with them, but to mutine the Kings army, which was lod∣ged in the Mountaines towards Hammadane, in a shew to keepe those straights, to giue impeachment to the passage of that other Army; but indeed to protract time onely, and to expect the euent of his other counsels. The other Cans rebelled easily and desirosly imbraced Ferrat Cans proposition, hasted the Army towards Casbin, which they entred without difficulty, both by the nature of the place, which is not of any strength, and conueyance of Ferrat. There were many daies spent in Counsell, and at last it was concluded, since the suppression of the King was cer∣taine, being abandoned by him which was his onely Cap∣taine and Counsellour; by so great a part of his strength; and vpon the confidence which Ferrat gaue them to mu∣tine the rest; that it would proue too dangerous, to call in those forces of the Turkes, which were in readinesse for their succour; Not knowing whether they should so easily free themselues of them againe, if they were once entred. They feared the Turkes purposes, and as much feared to know them; therefore to auoide the danger of being com∣pelled to experience them, they determined to write to the Bassa of Tauris, that the war was so certaine to bee fini∣shed, by themselues, that they would reserue his fauour till a more vrgent opportunity: and with that deliberation a principall man was dispatched with a present for the Bassa. Of this, the King had present aduice, by a confident messenger, and also that few nights after, the principals
of the Army were to meete together at Ferrats house, in∣uited to a great banquet; which being vnderstood by him, electing fiue thousand of his best men, and best horsing, with great, and close iourneies, he came to Casbin; where hauing secretly disposed his people, in the Mountaine, co∣uered with the quarter of Ferrats troupe, hee expected the signe which was to bee giuen him. The Prince (as it was appointed) failed not of comming, nor hee of his signe to the King, nor the King to accomplish his resolu∣tion: For Ferrat hauing protracted the banquet the most part of the night, when the whole company was heauy with wine and sleepe, the King was receiued into the house with three hundred men, where without any vp-roare, he slew all those which were inuited, to the num∣ber of three score and ten; the seruants and Pages being so suddenly taken hold of, and with such dexterity, that without any mouing of other rumors, the same fashion of feast of singing and of dancing, continued all the night; and in that space all the rest of those people, which the King had with him, were appointed, in the breaking of the day, to make the greatest shew, and the greatest noise that they could vnder the foote of the Mountaine, as though all the Army had beene there, marching to the Towne. When the Alarum beganne to bee hot in the Towne, and euery man fell to his Armes, and repaired to Ferrats lodging, where they supposed their Princes to haue bene; the King hauing disposed his three hundred men which were shut fitly in the house, and Zulpher ha∣uing his fiue thousand all in a Troope, in the great place, the threescore and ten Cans heades were shewed all laced vpon a string, and hung out of a Tarras; vpon which the King presently shewed himselfe, accompa∣nied with Ferrat Can; whereas the Maiesty of the King, the terrour of the sight, represented before them,
the feare of the Army, which they saw (as they thought) at hand, Zulpher and Ferrat Cans power amongst them, which they perceiued turned against them; their being destitute of Commanders, and the guiltinesse of their owne consciences, for their rebellion, stroke them into so dead an amazement, that they stood ready, rather to re∣ceiue all mischiefe, then that they had either courage, or mindes, or counsell to auoide it. The King, as though he had a while aduised with him∣selfe what he would both say and do; at last after a good pause, seeming that his royall mercy had preuailed against his iust indignation; hee told them, that the wickednesse of their vniuersall conspiracy against him, was such, that hee was distracted in himselfe, what to say or doe against them: for though they might excuse themselues vpon those Princes which had seduced them; yet they knew, that the others authority, had no more force vpon them then their own willing obedience, which called as great a punishmēt vpon the one, as the other. What cause they should haue, generally, to desire such an innouation of gouernement, as they, by their owne conuenence had erected amongst them, he could not deuise; his Grand-father, Father, and Brother, hauing euer guided the Helme of their State, with that integrity of iustice, and that vniuersall satisfacti∣on, that it was not to be wished, of any, to find more tran∣quility, for those which desired to liue onely quietly; nor more iust measure of honour, or due reward, then was magnificently giuen to those which had deserued them; and why they should haue lesse hope of him, he knew not, neuer hauing made, willingly, any other demonstration of his minde, then such as might be proportionable to their best expectations. But since his true feeling of humane frailty, made him well vnderstand how easie mens mindes are to be abused by others artifice, and their owne corrup∣tion,
hee to oke so great a compassion of the calamity into which they had, (either wilfully, or misled by others errors) cast themselues; that if he could haue any confidence, that they would truely repent of their past wickednesse, and bend their mindes to serue him with a perfect heart, hee could also easily perswade himselfe to change the seuerity of the iudgement, which they had merited, into mercy, forgiuenesse, and forgetfulnesse of their offence; and con∣tent himselfe, that this iniurious great disorder (which had hapned, as all other of that kind do, through the ignorance of many, and malice of few) should also be expiated by the bloud of those few, who had already concluded the great∣nesse of their vsurped authority, and their long hopes with a short and iust death. This being spoken, by the King, with courage and maiesty; and being so far from that which their guilty consciences did cause them to apprehend, facily brought forth the or∣dinary effectes of a multitude, which being easily inclined to hope more then they should, and to suffer lesse then is fit, as though the King, with his royall mercifull speech, had gi∣uen them as great a present good, as if hee had discharged them from the terrour of the punishment of almost an vnpardonable offence: cryed out, let the King liue, let the King liue; we are all King Abas his slaues, and will not suffer to liue any of his enemies: and there was more trouble to defend the poore people of Casbin from sacking by them, (their Towne euer hauing bene a wel-disposed harbour for the Rebels) then to turne their heartes and armes to the Kings part. Besides the succours which the Kings of Gheylan and Mazandran had sent the Rebels, were with great difficulty saued, and returned to their countries by the King of Persia, with commandement to tell their Mai∣sters, that as the poore men were not culpable, which obeyed their Princes authority, by whom they were sent
against him, and for that innocency, hee had giuen them their liues; so that hee would not bee long from seeking his reuenge vpon their Maisters, which had more iustly deserued it, by his neuer prouoking them to any offence. And when hee came with his Army thither, hee would proue, by those mens acknowledgement vnto him, whe∣ther they could discerne by the benefites they had al∣ready recieued of him in the gift of their liues, which they had forfeited vnto him, by bearing Armes with Rebels against him, what better hopes they might con∣ceiue of him, if they would dispose themselues to deserue good of him. In this meane time, the same of this great successe, flew to both the Armies about the Mountaines of Hama∣dan: which, as it comforted the Kings with exceeding ioyfulnesse; so it entred into the others with such a ter∣ror, that they presently vanished, euery man retyring to his best knowne safe-gard, that part of the warre ending with the blast onely of the fortune of the other, with little expence of time, labour, and bloud: which being vnderstood by the King, hee raised Oliuer-Dibeague to the title of a Can, and sent him, with those forces which hee had, to Hamadan, to settle the Country in a good forme of gouernement, and to ease it from the oppres∣sion of the other dispersed troupes. Zulpher hee also called Can, and sent him to Ardoutle which frontireth vpon Tauris, with an Army consisting of twenty and foure thousand men, in shew to quiet the Coun∣trey, but indeed, to preuent any moouing of the Turkes. And because hee knew, that as his state stood then weake, raised (as it were) freshly from a deadly sickenesse, it was not fitte for him (at that time) to bind himselfe to wrastle with such an enemy, by ta∣king knowledge of his ill disposition towards him; hee
dispatched Embassadours to Constantinople, to Tauris, and to the Bassa of Babylon, to congratulate with them, as with his friendes, for the felicity of his fortune; and to strengthen himselfe, by alliance, also the more firmely, against the proceeding of any thing which the Turke might designe against him, either then or in future time; he required the daughter of Simon Can, one of the Princes of the Georgians, to wife, which was, with as ready an affection performed, as demanded. Whiles that Lady was comming from her father, the King vnderstanding that the Cans sonne of Hisphaean held yet strong the Castle, and whether he gaue it out to amaze his Army, which now beganne to looke for satis∣faction, for the great trauels and dangers which they had passed, or whether hee had heard so indeed; true it is, that hee gaue out, that the most part of the treasure of the for∣mer Kings of Persia, was, by the consent of the Rebels, for security, kept together in that Castle: to receiue the which, and to chastice that Rebell, the King marched thither with a part onely of his Army, leauing the rest at Casbin, which was Frontier to Gheylan, against which his purpose carried him. Without much trouble, hee expugned the Fort at Hisphan, being a large circumference onely of Mud-wals, some what thicke, with Towers, and certaine ill battlements, and suppressed that Rebell; but Treasure hee found none, for the indignation whereof, hee made the world beleeue, he dismantled the Castle. His owne ne∣cessity to content the Army, and his Armies necessity to aske contentment, drew him suddenly back from thence to Casbin, where he had not stayed many daies, (for daily sa∣tisfaction with hope hauing no reall meanes) but that the Queene arriued, honourably accompanied with 2000 horse, and Byraicke Myrza her brother. The Marriage was soone dispatched, those countries vsing few ceremonies in
such cases: and God blessed them both so happily, that within the tearme of lesse then one yeare, shee brought him a gallant yong Prince who is now liuing, called So∣phir Mirza. The King vnwilling to oppresse his countrey, and de∣siring to reuenge himselfe vpon the kings of Gheylan, and Mazandran, to enlarge his Empire, and to content his Souldiers; hauing a flourishing Army, both in men, and the reputation of his present victory; resolued, all vnder one, to increase his stare, honour himselfe, ease his coun∣trey, and satisfie his Souldiers with the enemies spoyles. Gheylan is a country cut off from Persia, with great moun∣taines, hard to passe, full of woods (which Persia wanteth; being here and there onely sprinkled with hils, and very penurious of fuell, onely their gardens giue them wood to burne, and those hils, which are some fagots of Pista∣chios, of which they are well replenished) betweene those hils there are certaine breaches, rather then vallies; which, in the spring, when the snow dissolueth, and the great a∣boundance of raine falleth, are full of torrents; the Caspi∣an sea includeth this Countrey on the East: betweene which and the hils, is a continuing valley, so abounding in Silke, in Rice, and in Corne, and so infinitely peopled, that Nature seemeth to contend with the peoples indu∣stry; the one in sowing of men, the other in cultiuating the land; in which you shall see no peece of ground which is not fitted to one vse or other: their hils also (which are rockes towards Casbin) are so fruitfull of herbage, shado∣wed by the trees, as they shew, turned towards the sea, that they are euer full of cattell, which yeeldeth commodity to the countrey, by furnishing diuers other parts. In this then lay the difficulty most of the kings enterprize, how to en∣ter the countrey: for the rest there were great reasons of his hopes, the kings of those countries being amazed with
these first great successes of the king of Persia, their people discouraged, many Princes, which though they might v∣nite themselues against a common enemy, yet their deli∣berations could not be so speedy, as from one alone, nor so firme; many accidents happening, which might either absolutely dis-ioyne, or diuert them one from the other, or cast suspition amongst them, which might giue the way to a good occasion against one, by which the victory against the other might be also facilitated: Besides, his owne Ar∣my was so much raised in courage by their last happy suc∣cesses, and those so animated, through an opinion in themselues, of that reputation which had first followed the King, and the rest so desirous to wash away the ignominy of their offence, by some great and good act, ioyned to the hope of rich preyes; that there could bee almost thought of no obstacle able to withstand their valour and willingnesse. Yet before the king would enter into this action, re∣membring, that before he had better setled himselfe in his owne state, that he thrust himselfe vpon a cast of fortune, to seeke after the winning of others; yet since hee was for∣ced vnto it, by a certaine great necessity, hee resolued to take the best wayes for the securing all dangers which might rise against himselfe at home; and setting his coun∣trey in a reposed state, from so many tempests, which had contrarily moued it, as well as to make due and confident prouisions for his intended warres. First then he called vnto him to Casbin, all gouernors, & all administrators of Iustice, whosoeuer had occupyed those functions, during the vsurped rule of the Cans, through all his prouin∣ces; with the kinsmen, friends and children of the said Cans: besides, that all men of power, as Mirzaes, Cans, Sultans, and Beagues, which are principall Titles of Dukes, Princes, and Lords, should repaire thither,
without excuse of age,The means which K. Ab setled the qu et of Persia. sicknesse, or any other pretence whatsoeuer: which being done, he appointed new Gouer∣nors and Officers of all sorts; he cleared all his prouinces for three yeares, from paying any tribute-custome, or any other ordinary or extraordinary exaction whatsoeuer. His chiefe Viseire he made one Haldenbeague, a wise man, ex∣cellently seene in all affaires, of great experience; but such a one as was onely his creature, without friends or pow∣er: him hee commanded to passe through all his prouin∣ces, accompanied with the Xa-Hammadaga; who is, as it were, Knight Marshall, to cleare them from vagabonds, robbers, and seditious persons. Ologonlie, which had fol∣lowed him in all his aduersity (a man of great worthinesse) he made bearer of his great Seale, which is an office there, liker the Lord priuy Seale, then Chancellor (The place of the Viseire comprehending in it, the office of Chan∣cellor, and high Treasurer) him he also aduanced to the dignity of a Can. Bastana, an ancient approued man, both for fidelity and other worthinesse, he made princi∣pall Aga of his house; which is as great Chamberlaine. Curtchibasschie Captaine of his Guard, which is a gene∣ral-ship of twelue thousand shot, who attend at the Port by turnes, two hundred and fifty euery quarter; ex∣cept when the King goeth to the warres, that they are all bound to be present. Ferrat Can hee made his Ge∣nerall. Thus hauing wisely and prouidently placed, through all his estates, those who must be most assured to him, their fortunes depending onely vpon him, hauing no more strength, nor authority in themselues, then they recei∣ued from him: and hauing all the great ones in his Army with him, or such of them as could not bee able to fol∣low him, either by their few, or many yeares, or sicke∣nesse, so securely left at Casbin, that they could not by
themselues, or any other, moue any innouation. And moreouer, hauing dispatched all those, and keeping their persons with him which had any obligation to the for∣mer Cans, secured by that meanes (as much as the coun∣sell of any man could secure him) from perill at home: hauing called Oliuer di Can from Hamadan, and ap∣poynted him a successor for that Gouernement with ten thousand new men; hee set himselfe forward to his en∣terprize, with his old Troopes, and great part of his rebelled Army, with no greater courage and coun∣sell then fortune: for those men which were remitted by him to Gheylan, and Mazandran, (as those which had beene somewhat exercised in the warres) hauing, with some more, adioined vnto them the guard of the straights, from which the maine Army of the Kings was some foure leagues remoued (remembring the benefite of the King, better then their faith to their Princes) at the very sight of the first Troopes, retired themselues from the places left to their confidence in charge; which aduantage be∣ing followed by Ferrat, with the Alarum giuen, fell so iustly vpon that Army, that what with the vnexpected terror of the straights abandoning, and their being surpri∣sed in disorder, the Army was facily broken, with the death of two of the Kings, and an infinite slaughter of people, which had beene much greater if the woods had not couered them from the fury of their enemies. The greatest of those kings hauing escaped with much diffi∣culty (accompanied euer with the terror of the perill from which he had escaped) neuer ended his flight, vntill hee came into Seruane; and from thence went to Constanti∣nople, to desire succour from the Turke, where he yet li∣ueth. The other, which remained, being but one, without any great difficulty, or alteration of fortune, was sup∣pressed.
The Countrey being first spoiled, and ransomed at a great rate, which they might well beare, by reason of their great riches, which they had gathered together through a long peace, and the Kings Army excellently well satisfied; he dispatched, instantly, Embassadours to the Turke, the Georgians and his old friend, the King of Corassan, to giue them an account of this new victory: not doubting, but as it would bee exceeding pleasant to some; so it would bee as bitter to others: and leauing Ferrat Can to go∣uerne the Countrey, and Oliuer Dibeague, as his assistant, but to bee commanded by him, hee returned himselfe full of glory, and great victory into Persia, disposing himselfe to reduce his state to that excellent forme of gouernment which now it hath. First then, after his arriuall in Casbin, hauing heard by his Viseire, & the relation of Xa-Hammadaga, of some who had not onely spoyled the Subiects in their substances; but the country of all orders, & iust forme of gouernement, which now it hath; and giuen them, by that meanes, more matter of dis-vnion, then vnion; insomuch, that they were ful of theeues, of vagabonds, of factions, & such like insolencies: he iudged it fit, to reduce it the more peaceable and obedi∣ent, to giue it in those cases, a good condition of gouern∣ment: Whereupon, he presently dispatched that Xa-ham∣madaga, a terrible, and resolute person, with full power and authority, for the reformation of those disorders; who in short time, though with most terrible examples, reduced all the Prouinces to a vnite tranquility, with mighty repu∣tation. Whilst hee was busied in that administration; the King, to shew that it was necessity, that counselled to giue him that excessiue authority, and to preserue it from being odi∣ous to himselfe, appointed in the chiefe city of euery Pro∣uince, a Gouernour elected of those of most valour: to
him he ioyned two Iudges of criminall and ciuill causes, a Treasurer, two Secretaries, with an excellent president, and two Aduocates generall, for the causes both parti∣cular and generall of the whole Prouince; Besides the par∣ticular Aduocate of euery Citty, which should be resident in that Metropolis. These determined all causes within themselues of those Prouinces in which they had the ad∣ministration; and because they should neither be burthen∣some to the Prouinces, nor corrupted in paritializing; the King paid them their stipend, enioyning them vpon paine of life to take no other sort of reward. And because such things, and causes might fall out, as by reason of the im∣portance of them, or appellations of the parties might be brought before himselfe, because hee would euer know what he did, and be continually informed, not onely of the generall state of the Prouinces, but of their particular ad∣ministration; hee ordained Posts once euery weeks from all parts, to bring all sort of relations to the Court; for which cause also hee willed that one of the two generall Aduocates should euer be resident there, who receiuing those relations presenteth them to the Viseire, and hee to the King. The Viseire, sitteth euery morning in counsell about the generall state of all the Kings Prouinces, ac∣companied with the Kings Councell, Aduocates resi∣dent, and the Secretaries of State; there are all matters heard, and the opinions of the Councell written by the Se∣cretaries of State; then after dinner, the Councell, or such a part of them as the King will admit, present those pa∣pers, of which the King pricketh those hee will haue pro∣ceed; the rest are cancelled; which being done: the Coun∣cell retire them againe to the Viseirs, and then determine of the particular businesse of the Kings house. The King himselfe euery Wednesday, sitteth in the Councell pub∣likely, accompanied with all those of his Councell, and
the fore-said Aduocates: thither come a floud of all sorts of people, rich and poore, and of all Nations without di∣stinction, and speake freely to the King in their owne ca∣ses, and deliuer euery one his owne seuerall Bill, which the King receiueth; pricketh some, and reiecteth other, to be better informed of. The Secretaries of State presently re∣cord in the Kings Booke those which he hath pricked, with all other acts, then by him enacted; the which booke is carried by a Gentleman of the Chamber, into his Cham∣ber, where it euer remaineth: and woe bee to his Viseire, if after the King hath pricked, Bill, or Supplication, it bee a∣gaine brought the second time. When he goeth abroad to take the aire, or to passe the time in any exercise, the poorest creature in the world may giue him his Supplication: which hee receiueth, readeth, and causeth to bee registred; and one request, or com∣plaint, is not, ordinarily, brought him twise: and though these bee great waies, wise waies, and iust waies, to tye vn∣to him the hearts of any people; yet the nature of those is so vile in themselues, that they are no more, nor longer good, then they are by a strong and wisely-tempered hand made so: The Countrey not being inhabited by those nobly-disposed Persians, of which there are but a few, and those few are as they euer were: But being mightily wa∣sted by the inundation of Tamberlaine, and Ismael after∣ward making himselfe the head of a Faction, against the Ottomans, and by that reason, forced to re-people his Countrey to giue himselfe strength of men against so po∣tent an Aduersary, calling in Tartars, Turcomans, Courdines, and of all scum of Nations; which though they now liue in a better countrey, yet haue not changed their bad na∣tures: though as, I said, so carefull and true Princely a re∣gard of the King for the establishment of good and iust orders, for the gouernement of this Countrey, in
equity, generall security, and tranquility; had beene of sufficient ability to haue bound the hearts of people vnto him: Yet knowing what his were, and to leaue no meanes vnacted which might both assure them more, and him∣selfe with them; because he knew, that their owne dispo∣sitions, which were euill, would neuer, rightly, iudge of the cause of many rigorous examples that had passed, which by that fault in them, had ingendred him hatred amongst them; to purge their minds from that sickenesse, and gaine them the more confidently, hee determined to shew, that if there were any cruell act, brought forth, it did not grow from himselfe, but from necessity. Wherfore hee displaced, by little, (finding particular occasions daily against some or other) all the whole Tymarri of his estate; as though from them had growne all such disorders, as had corrupted the whole gouernment, sending new ones, and a great part of them Gheylaners to their possessions, with more limited authority, and more fauourable to the people; the old ones part he casherd, part he distributed in Gheylan and Mazandran, which he had new conquered: so that by that Art, the people began to rest exceeding well satisfied, and himselfe the more secured; those which suc∣ceeded them being bound to his fortune; and those which were remoued also, being disposed in the new conquered Prouinces, which they were bound to maintaine in securi∣ty, for their owne fortunes, which depended onely vpon their preseruing them for the King. When all these things were done, and the King began to thinke himselfe, throughly established, for a long time, both from intrinsicke and extrinsicke dangers, The Turkes forces being so occupied in the warres of Hungary, that hee had no leasure to looke to his increasing; the Tartarres of Corrasan, his friendes, by the old hospitality which hee had receiued from their King; and if not his
friends, yet cold enemies, such as would bee long resol∣uing, before they would attempt any thing to his preiu∣dice: There fell out a new occasion to trouble, both the peace of his minde and Countrey, if it had not beene preuented with great dexterity, celerity, and fortune. For Ferrat Can, not regarding his benefites done to the King, knowing too well his owne worthinesse, and at∣tributing vnto that, the successes of all the kings fortunes, and for so great causes, not being able to limit his mind within any compasse of satisfaction, not resting conten∣ted with the place of Generall, nor Gouernment of Gheylan, nor with the honour to be called the Kings Fa∣ther, but despising that Haldenbeague should bee Viseire, and not himselfe all; which had giuen the king all; be∣gan to take counsell, to innouate, and alter things with the Bassaes of Seruan, and Tauris. So dangerous are too great benefites from a subiect to a Prince, both for them∣selues and the Prince, when they haue their minds only capable of merit, and nothing of duty. These practises of his, were most dangerous, for which hee did more assure himselfe, to haue layd a strong foundation for the discontentment of those Ti∣mari which the King had sent into his Gouernement; and so had they beene, questionlesse, if Oliuer di-Can, through his true zeale to his Maisters seruice; and, perhappes, a little enuy at the others greatnesse, had not made him so watchfully diligent, that hauing ga∣thered his intentions by very momentuall circumstan∣ces, hee gaue the King, from time to time, notice of them; which at the first were negligently receiued, and rather taken as matter of emulation, then truth: But when those very same aduertisements euer continued, and Oliuer di Can, was not at all terrified from sending of them; neither by the kings neglecting them, nor rebuke, and that
Mahomet Shefia was also secretly arriued in the Court, with more particular and certaine aduice, that the Bassa of Seruan had sent a great summe of money to Ferrat, which was receiued on a certaine day, and in a certaine place. The king hereupon presently sent Xa-Tamascooli∣beague, his chiefe fauourite, to will Ferrat Can, for very important affaires, for the determining of which his pre∣sence was requisite, to repaire to the Court; which hee excused, through his indisposition, which he said to bee such, that he could not possibly trauell: so that persisting in that deniall, when Xa-Tamas Coolibeague perceiued that he would not be perswaded, he returned with all expe∣dition to the king; who assuring himselfe the more by the denial, of the former related accusations, instantly com∣manded his guard of twelue thousand Courtchies to be in a readinesse; with which, and a thousand of the Xa-Hamma∣gaes he vsed such celerity, that he preuented the newes of his comming, and was sooner arriued at Ferrats house then he had almost opinion that his messenger had beene returned: yet, although amazed with his owne guiltinesse, and the kings sudden comming, he made shift to make great shew of the indisposition which hee had so long counterfeited. The king, as soone as he came vnto him, said; that hee had taken a great iourney to visit him in his sicknesse, and to bring him the cure thereof; and hauing commanded all out of the Chamber, but themselues onely alone (as the king himselfe told me) he vsed such like speeches vnto him: Father,he kings gra∣us speech Ferrat. I do acknowledge, that first from God, then from you, these fortunes which now I haue, haue receiued their being; And I know, that as a man, I may both erre in my merit to God, and in my well deseruing of your seruice. But my intention, I can assure you, is most perfect in both: the time of my establishment in my estate, hath beene so
small, that I could scarce vse it sufficiently to performe my generall duty towards my people, ouer whom (by Gods permission) I am appoynted; much lesse to prouide for e∣uery particular satisfaction, as I mind, and will doe; which you principally, as a Father to me, both in your yeares, and my election should haue borne withal. But since some ill spirit hath had power to mis-leade your wisedome, so far as to make you forget your great vertue; you shall once re∣ceiue wholesome counsell from me, as I haue done often from you: And because that all counsels, as well in publicke, as priuate deliberations, require a reposed spirit, free, and pure from wrath, feare, all perturbation or perticular interest; for a troubled mind is more apt to erre, then to aduse iustly, and hath more need of proper medicines for it selfe, then it hath properly in it selfe to apply any comfort to others; and is fitter to receiue, then to giue counsell: from which, as from a great and violent current, are caried all those errours and disorders which are brought vpon rash deliberations, the which haue euer long repentances, and disasters, as the perpetuall memo∣ries of their hauing bene; and are most of all detestably blame∣able, when such an imprudency is accompanied with that infi∣nite damage, as to thinke of alteration in a state, which can∣not proceede without in-iustice, seeleratenesse, bloud, and a thousand mischiefes: an act in it selfe wonderfull difficult, wonderfull wicked, and proceeding from an incomparable vile quality. But hee that can restraine himselfe from being transported by vntemperate apetites, and can dominate his passions, and giue a iust rule to himselfe, to his cupidities and desires, doth euer giue the best time to all deliberations, by mit∣tigating heat and fury; and so altereth all counsell, from that nature which it receiueth, from an vnquiet and troubled mind: Which if you had done, you would not haue entred into a thought onely of so dangerous an action against your selfe, nor so dishonourable as to haue machinated the
ruine and trouble of your owne King, Friend, & Country; which though it be palesated, it is but to my selfe only, who rather desire to chastice you as a friend, with good admo∣nition, then by rigour. Therfore, though it be euer incident to all men, to haue this great defect, to feare chiefely nearest dangers, and to esteeme much lesse, then they ought, of the fu∣ture: Yet bee you most assured, that the perill which you might feare from my person, is much lesse then that which you had throwne your selfe into, if you had, or should pro∣secute your enterprizes. From my person you shall neuer, (except by great constraint from your selfe) looke for any thing of other condition, then a true Princely loue, and a Royall regard of your seruices: In the other course, you called against my will, vpon your selfe, the rigor of Iustice, and fury of the sword, which in the warre consumeth all a∣like. And because in that aduersity which a mans minde brin∣geth vpon himselfe, the feares and terrours are euer greater then the euils which concurre with them; be you of good comfort without the feeling onely of any such conditio∣ned thing, and call strength from your minde to your bo∣dy, that you may endure to go with me to Hisphaan, where you shall haue cause to digest all these melancholies. Fer∣rat neither excused, nor confessed; but indifferently an∣swered the king, as sory to haue giuen cause of offence, and infinitely reioycing (as hee seemed) that the king had so royally pacified himselfe with him: and not daring to re∣fuse to go with the king, desired him to vse some few daies in the visiting of the Countrey; in which time, hee hoped that God, and the comfort of his presence, would raise him from his infirmity. The king certainly (as I before said) was by all necessity in the world, either forced to execute him, or to recōcile him perfectly vnto him: for any midle course had but made him desperate, and aggrauated all sort of perill, which he might haue feared from him; his ser∣uices
already done, his valour and vertue were of great moment to perswade the king to the easier way; being ioy∣ned to his owne excellent mind, which I haue seene the ra∣rest proofes of, that may bee brought forth by Prince, or man liuing. But Ferrat Can (who knew, that true iustice neuer weigh∣eth offences, and deserts, but seuerally, and without inter∣mingling them together, rewardeth the one, and chasticeth the other; and that benefites are more easier forgotten, then in∣iuries) feeling the weight of his offence, and measuring the kings heart by his owne, gaue the wickednesse of his minde power ouer his vertue; And, though hee seemed altered to all good intentions, yet his heart was still swollen with that poyson which shortly brought him to destruction. The king hauing staid some eight, or ten dayes in the Countrey, was sooner hastened thence, then hee thought, by the newes of the Queenes death, who was deceased by a sudden and violent sicknesse, after his departure: so that with great speede, taking Ferrat with him; and leauing Lieu-tenant in the Countrey, for Ferrat, Mahomet Shefia, he returned to Hisphaan; where, after some dayes spent in sorrow, for his great losse, hee sent to Alexander, the other Can of the Georgians, to demand his daughter, by that meanes to binde againe that league, which might haue beene dissolued by the death of the other Queene: In that Embassage went Xa-Tamas Coolibeague, who returned with the Lady within few moneths. In the meane time, the brother to that king of Corasan, who had so royally and carefully brought vp the king of Persia, when he fled from the wrath of his father, rebelled a∣gainst his brother, slue him, and all his children; but onely one; whose tutors fled with him into the mountaines, & so escaped the present danger, & persecution of that tyrant.
Diuers other also, as they had been in estimation or fauour with the old king, fearing for that, the violence of the pre∣sent authority, and others, onely discontented with the al∣teration, and the wicked meanes of it, fled into Persia; by whom the king hauing largely and perfectly vnderstood the state of things, hauing so faire a way both to shew an infinite royall point of gratitude to that one poore poste∣rity of the murdered king, for great obligations to the fa∣ther; and withall, to assure himselfe in future times and oc∣casions, from that certaine enemy, which had euer hung, like a dangerous cloud ouer his state, vsually breaking into terrible tempests, as it was, or should bee carried against him by the breath of the Turke: though he knew those Tar∣tars so obstinate enemies to his Gouernment, and Religi∣on, that if they had the most odious reasons of dis-union amongst themselues, yet that they would combine against him; without reposing himselfe vpon any hope to be hol∣pen by those partialities, which the refuged vnto him see∣med to promise; but confident onely in the iustice of the cause which he intended, in his owne force, vertue, wise∣dome and fortune; hee resolued to gather his Armie, and to goe for those parts; to which hee was, besides his owne disposition, mightily instigated by Ferrat Can, whose feare & ambition, being without meanes of end, gaue him assu∣rance, by the place of Generall which hee held, to haue some faire opportunity giuen him to end them, with the kings ruine, and without his owne danger. Thirty thousand men the king tooke with him for that warre, twelue thousand Harquebusiers, which bare long peeces, halfe a foote longer then our Muskets, sleightly made; the bullet of the height of Caliuer, which they vse well and certainely: and eighteene thousand horse, which may seeme a smal troop in these places, where the wars are carried with innumerable multitudes. But the king of Per∣siaes
iudgement agreeth with that of the best experienced Captains, that multitudes are confusers of orders, & deuourers of time, and of those meanes which nourish the wars; and are good for no other vse, but to make a war soone breake off, and to consume the world. This Armie being chosen out from all his forces, of elected good men, hee carried into Corasan with wonderfull expedition; & had taken it vtterly vnpro∣uided, if Ferrat Cans aduertisement had not preuented his celerity; who had not onely giuen notice to them, but to the Bassa of Tauris, of the kings purpose, and his owne re∣solution, promising them a certaine victory, and the deli∣uery of the kings owne person. A dayes iourney the king passed peaceably into the Countrey, without the sight onely of an enemy: himselfe with fiue thousand of the best men, accompanied with diuers of the principal lest, was a kinde of vauntguard to the rest, which followed with Fer∣rat Can, Zulphir Can, and Oliuer di-Can, which marched softly. The king by that meanes, was farre aduanced; and being almost assured in himselfe, that through the celerity of his comming, he should find yet no enemy sufficiently able to resist him, & more confidently, by the perswasion of Ferrat Can: some sixe hundred horse, vnder the leading of Vseph-Aga (which were sent to discouer before the kings troope) fell vpon fifty thousand of the enemy; vpon which sight he would faine haue retired: but being so farre inga∣ged, that he could not, and vnable to resist so great a force, with the losse of almost all his cōpany, he was beaten back to the Kings grosse: who by the dust rising a farre off, and the great noyse following, imagining what it was indeed, with a great & ready courage prouided himselfe ready to fight, and dispatched Messenger vpon Messenger, to command Ferrat Can to aduance vnto him. To the first Ferrat answered, that it was but a troope of some few ras∣cals, and desired the king to march on, and not trouble
himselfe nor his Army, and to diuers the like. At the last, when yong Hassan-Can came from the king, and told him the kings danger, and that certainely the whole force of the enemy had charged him; he began to shew feare, & to call a Councell of the Commanders, then to know what they were best to resolue of, for the sauing of the Army, since the king had so rashly lost himselfe. Which when Oli∣uer di-Can heard, vpbraiding him of treason, called vpon all those which loued the king to follow him; and putting spurs to his horse, being followed by Courtchibassa, & most of the kings Guard, & many other, with all possible haste, speeded to the king; who, by this time, was forced to su∣staine, and retire, as well as he could, without disorder, or shew of feare. But when this Troope, of Oliuer di-Can was seene, his men receiued new courage; and the ene∣my, which depended more vpon Ferrats treason, then their owne valour, began to be exceeding amazed, doubt∣ing that it had bin the whole Army, and that Ferrat had ex∣changed his treason from his Maister to them: Wherefore slacking their first fury, and rather standing at a gaze, then fighting, the king commanded Vseph-Aga to charge them throughly afresh, and not to giue them time to take new courage: which hee did, with so good for∣tune, that lighting vpon the vsurper of Corasan, and his sonne, hee slue them both with his owne handes; from which grew the first maine flight of the enemy, and the be∣ginning of the victory for the king. The chase was despe∣ratly followed, so that in that battell, & the chase were slain 30000 men, with the vsurper king and his son; and diuers of the principall of the country taken. That night the king pitched his Tents in the place of the battell; and being in∣formed, by Oliuer di-Can, and the whole army, which cried out, with open mouth, of Ferrats treason, tēpering the out∣ward shew of his indignation with a compassionat feeling
of mans errours, and frailty; excused the constraint, and necessity, of the iustice which he was forced to do: prote∣sting, that though for his states, and owne preseruation he was at last compelled to giue his iustice place, aboue the power of his loue, and obligation: yet what the father had rent from himselfe, by the violence of his owne mis∣deeds; his sonne should find ripened for him, who should bee heire of what his father had well merited by his for∣mer seruices, as he hoped he would be of his vertue; pray∣ing God, that his fathers vices, onely, might die with him∣selfe. Which when he had said, he gaue Oliuer Di-Can the Generalship of his Army, and appointed him to do exe∣cution vpon Ferrat, who being resolued of that iudge∣ment, which his double offence had brought vpon him, attended ready in his Tent, without feare, to die, or desire to liue; and there receiued that punishment, which was vn∣worthy of his excellent parts, if hee had made that true vse of them which he should. Zulpher Can, his brother, knowing that he had as highly and as much offended as his brother had, yet wanting the same courage to receiue the iudgement, which he had to offend, fled to the port of the Kings Tent, and there pro∣strated himselfe on the ground; whence being called by Oliuer Di-Can, he denyed to die any where, but there; that the King when hee should come forth, might tread vpon that bloud, which had so vilely, and vndeseruedly offended him: which being brought to the King, by a Page that wished well to Zulpher, and had some good hope of the Kings nature, that hee might doe the poore Prince some good; after a little pause, the King came forth, and behol∣ding Zulpher lying grouelling on the ground, pittied him, and despising, withall, his little valour: Behold, said he, to those which stood by, how weake a foundation reputa∣tion hath, which is not erected from a mans owne vertue.
This man was so great yesterday, that you all honored him, and now lyeth despised before you all, through his owne wickednesse. He hath bene aduanced by me, for his bro∣thers vertues, and with the death of his brother, he doth shew you all, that no worthinesse of his owne, but that which abounded in his brother, if hee could haue made good vse of it, gaue him courage also to seeme capable of those honours which I bestowed on him. Zulpher, God forgiueth mee as great sinnes hourely, which I commit against him, as thy fault can be to me: and since it hath pleased him, that I hold so great a place by him here, I will also vse the example of his infinite goodnesse, for the pat∣terne of this mercy, and referre my vengeance to him, and giue thee time to repent; and the rather, because thy abiect∣nesse taketh all apprehension from me of cause to doubt thee: Hee neuer dareth hurt a King, which feareth to die. And remember that this is the first day of thy life, in which thou must take more vertuous waies, then thou hast hitherto walked in, that I may haue honour by the mercy which I haue shewed thee, and profite by thy good serui∣ces; and thy selfe, maist cast away farre from thee, by ho∣nest and good deedes, the shamefull memory which men will haue of thy past wicked Treason. This was the end of that great and foule conspiracy, which gaue great hope to the Kings enemies; and ending by such a prouidence, was the meanes of the Kings greater and better security, which could neuer haue bene perfect so long as so great a man had liued, both hauing cause to feare, & by that giuing continuall cause to be feared. Next day, the King mar∣ched farther into the Countrey, and so daily aduanced on without obstacle; the keyes of all their Townes meeting him by the way; and at the last, an Embassage from the whole state, with a generall submission: which when hee had receiued, hauing spent some time, in the setling of
such a gouernement as was securest for himselfe, and ha∣uing receiued the yong Rrince, sonne to the first King, and diuers others of the principall of the Countrey, hauing left order with Xa-Endibeague, whom hee left there with the best part of his Army, which he increased after∣wards to 30000 men, to extirpate all those which were likeliest, either through their obligation to the vsurper, or through their owne particular interest, to make innouati∣on, he returned with that yong Prince, and those prisoners into Persia. The most part of this time I was at Casbin, courteously vsed by Marganobeague, the Maister of the Kings house, and not amisse by any. When the King was come within sixe miles of Casbin, he stayed there, some three dayes, to the entent to make his entry with such an estimation of his victory,The Kings Triumphant entry into Ca¦bin after his victory. as was fit for so great and happy a successe of fortune: and, in truth, I thinke that hee did it most, to de∣clare the greatnesse of it to vs that were strangers, by such a strange demonstration. The night before hee entred, there were 30000 men, sent out of the Towne on foote with horse-mens staues, vpon which were fastened vizards of so many heads: All those in the morning, when we were commanded to meet him, (the Gouernour hauing proi∣ded vs horses) we found marching in battell aray towards the Towne; and before the two heads of the King, and his sonne, foure Officers of Armes, such as they vse, bearing in their hands great Axes of shining Steele, with long helues; after those battalions, followed the Xa-Hamma∣dagacs horse-men; after those, a number of Gentlemen of the Kings Court; after those, a 100 spare-horses, with as many of the Kings Pages; after those, the prisoners, ac∣companied with Bastan-Aga; then a great rancke of his chiefe Princes; amongst whom, were all the Embassa∣dours, which vsed to bee resident in his Court; then fol∣lowed
the yong Prince of Corazan, accompanied with Xa-Tamas-Coolibeague, the Kings principall fauorite; and then the King himselfe alone; and after him, some fiue hundred Courtiers of his Guard. Marganobeague was with vs, and making vs large passage, through all those Troupes. ir Anthony herleis first utation, and eech to the ing.When we came to the King, we alighted, and kissed his Stirrop: my speech was short vnto him; the time being fit for no other: That the fame of his Royall vertues, had brought me from a farre Countrey, to be a present specta∣tor of them; as I had beene a wonderer at the report of them a farre off: if there were any thing of worth in mee, I presented it with my selfe, to his Maiesties seruice. Of what I was, I submitted the consideration to his Maiesties iudgement; which he should make vpon the length, the danger, and the expence of my voyage, onely to see him, of whom I had receiued such magnificent and glorious relations. The Kings an∣were.The Kings answere vnto me was infinite affable: That his Countrey, whilst I should stay there, should be freely com∣manded by mee, as a Gentleman that had done him infi∣nite honour, to make such a iourney for his sake; onely bid mee beware that I were not deceiued by rumors, which had, peraduenture, made him other then I should finde him: It was true, that God had giuen him both power and mind to answere to the largest reports which might bee made good of him; which if hee erred in the vse of, hee would aske counsell of me, who must needs haue much vertue in my selfe, that could moue mee to vndergoe so much, and so many perils to know that of another. And that hee spake smiling, willing me to get on horse-backe: which when I had done, he called Haldenbeague, his Viseire, and Oliuer Di-Can his Generall, and commanded them to take my brother and me betwixt them; and my company
was disposed by Marganobeague, amongst the rest of the Kings Gentlemen of his Court: and in that ordr, the King entred Casbin, and passing to the great place, he alighted with the cheifest of his Princes & Officers, whō he caused to bring vs with them, & went into a kind of banquetting house, in which there were staires to ascend by into a Tar∣ras, where the King ate down, & the greatest of those Prin∣ces, & we among thē. This Tarras looked vpon the place, where after we had ben a litle, & beheld some of the Court exercising thēselues at giuoco-di-canna, that great troupe was suddenly vanished, so without all sort of rumor, that it bred infinite wonder in me, cōsidering how much tumulte we made in these parts in the disposing of a far lesse cōpa∣ny. Whilst we sate there, the King called me againe vnto him; & when I had confirmed in more words, the very same I had before said vnto him: Thē, said he, you must haue the proofe of time to shew you, either the errors, or the truth of these rumours, since you can make no iudgement of what you haue yet seene, which is but the person of a man, and this eminēce which God hath giuen me, for any thing you know, may be more through my fortune, thē my vertue. But since your pains & trauel hath had no other aspect, but to know me, we must haue a more intrinsicke acquaintance to perfect that knowledge; & how you wil indure the fashions of my coūtry, you can iudge best your selfe which are mai∣ster of your owne humor: This I will assure you of, you shal want no respect frō my people, nor honor from my selfe; & therwith bid me fare-wel, for that present, comitting me & my cōpany to Bastan-Aga to be conducted to my lodging. Next morning I sent the King a present,Sir Anthony Sheris pre∣sent to the King of Per of sixe paire of Pendants of exceeding faire Emerauldes, and meruailous artificially cut; and two other Iewels of Topasses, excel∣lent well cut also; one cup of three peeces, set toge∣ther with gold inameled; the other a Salte, and a very
faire Ewer of Christall, couered with a kind of cutworke of siluer and gilt, the shape of a Dragon; (all which, I had of that Noble Florentine) which his Maiesty accepted very graciously: and that night, I was, with my brother, inuited by him to a banquet, where there was onely Byra∣icke Myrza, and Sultan Alye, with Xa-Tamas-Cooli∣beague, his cheife Minion; there he had diuers discourses with mee, not of our apparell, building, beauty of our woemen, or such vanities; but of our proceeding in our warres, of our vsuall Armes, of the commodity and dis∣commodity of Fortresses, of the vse of Artillary, and of the orders of our gouernement: in which, though my vn∣skilfulnesse were such, that I knew my errours were greater then my iudgement; yet I had that felicity of a good time, that I gaue him good satisfaction, as it seemed. For in my discourse, hauing mentioned the hauing of cer∣taine Models of Fortification in some bookes at my lod∣ging, which were onely left me in the spoile which was made of me at Babylon: Next day, after dinner, he came thi∣ther, with all the principallest of the Court, where hee spent, at least, three howers in perusing them, and not vn∣properly speaking of the reasons of those things himselfe. Next night hee sent for mee againe, into a place which they call Bazar, like our Burze; the shops, and the roofe of which were so full of lights, that it seemed all of a fire. There was a litle Scaffold made where he sate, and as eue∣ry man presented him with diuers sorts of friuts, so hee parted them some to one, some to another, and there hee continued some foure howers; in which time, hee tooke mee aside, with my Interpreter, and asked mee, very sadly, whether I would content my selfe to stay with him; not for euer, for that were too a great wrong to my friends, who should loose mee from their comfort, being diuided so farre from them; for my owne fortune hee would not
speake of, but onely thus much; since I had told him I was a subiect to a Prince, he knew, that then my fortune also must depend vpon the will and fauour of that Prince; and hee assured himselfe, that he was as able, and more desirous to do me good then any: therefore if I would resolue to giue him that litle satisfaction; he should perswade himselfe the more confidently, that the cause of my comming was such, as I told him, the loue of his person and nothing else. I an∣swered him, I could say no more o his Maiesty then I had already done; that a report, onely, of his excellent vertues, had brought mee thither, that a better experience had bound me so fast to him and them, that as he was Maister of my minde, so hee should bee of my person and time, which were both subiect to his command. For those things of fortune, they were the least things that I regarded, as his Maiesty well saw by my great expence thither, onely to satisfie my sight: but as I knew my selfe infinitely ho∣noured by his Maiestie vouchsafing to serue himselfe of mee; so that was to me aboue all other fortunes and satis∣factions. His Maiesty seemed wonderfully well content with my answere; and that night began to shew me extra-ordinary publicke fauour, and so continued all the time of his being in Casbin, daily increasing by some or other great demonstration. Sixe weekes hee stayed there, giuing his accustomed audience to the people; In which time I saw the nota∣blest example of true vnpartiall royall iustice, that I thinke any Prince in the world could produce. The Gouerner of Casbin was appointed to that administration,A memo punishm extortio▪ in the maine seruice of the Kings state when the Rebels were first suppressed; A man exceedingly and perticularly fauored of the King: he taking the adantage of the time, which being troubled, gaue him liuely colour, to make great pro∣fite vpon the people, and confident in the Kings fauour,
abused both the one and the other by extreme extortions; thinking (because of his owne greatnesse, and the Countries offence against the King, the memory of which euery man would feare to receiue) that what he did by vi∣olence and force should by as great power of terrour re∣maine vnknowne: but some, to whō he had offered so much that they thought no extremity could happen them of a worse conditiō, made desperate through that hazard to put vp lamentable supplications to the King; who hauing read them (as his fashion is) commanded the parties to-speake freely; with this caution, that they should beware that they charged nothing falsely; for as he would not that any mini∣ster of his shold abuse his authority, by any vniust burthen, vpon the worst of the people; so hee would also prouide by seuere example, that none should presume to impose false accusations vpon any, whom he had thought worthy to carry authority vnder him. Notwithstanding, those poore men did not onely mainetaine their accusations, but brought forth diuers witnesses; and others, perceiuing so iust a course held by his Maiesty, emboldned by it, laid before him also, in their humble sort, their owne oppres∣sions, suffered by the like violence: Vpon which hee com∣manded Marganobeague to be sent for, who was the Mai∣ster of his house in Casbin, demanding of him whether he had heard of those things; he answered no, being pri∣uate acts of the Gouernour, (publicke causes, which were brought before the President, Iudges, Aduocates, and his Maiesties Councell, appointed for the good of the Pro∣uince, hauing euer taken those direct waies which were fit for his Maiesty, and benefite of the Prouince) if the Go∣uernour, in his particular acts, had taken counsels with his particular appetites, and executed them according to the same, neither he, nor any of the Councel were blameable; neuer hauing heard a voice onely to that effect: which
those men also, (who were a great number) falling downe vpon their faces, confessed to the King; and that their long silence had giuen the Gouernour the more boldnesse to vse the vtermost of extortion, and tyrannous exaction vpon them. The Gouernour denied some, maintained other to bee done vpon iust causes: but all so confusedly, and with so vnstable a fashion of proceeding, as hee bewrayed his owne guiltinesse: notwithstanding the king stayed his iudgement, either of him or the causes, vntill another day of hearing. In the meane time hee appoynted Marganobeague, Bastan-Aga, and one Maxausebeague; (which is, as it were, Treasurer of his house) to take some secret wayes to finde the true carriage of the Gouernour, during the whole time of his function; Which they did with great vprightnesse and dexterity. And hauing related what they had approuedly found, there were so many, and so great causes brought against him, I meane of wresting of Money, bribery, monopolizing, and such things, as more could not bee imagined: which had beene small matters in a Princes state, whose fauours and graces are priuiledged aboue the common good of the people; and who change by their owne conniuence, their Royall e∣state to a tyranny of fauourites, and a few Counsellors: who concurring in the spoyle of the people, concurre also in so cruell a suppression of their iust cryes, that their lifting vp their voyces, for Iustice, is as great a sinne, as almost a perfect Rebellion: and the same Iustice, which should protect them against inique op∣pression, inflicteth seuere chastisement; onely for pre∣suming to palesate such oppressions: A miserable cala∣mitie for the poore flocke, where the Sheepheards heareth the wooll, and the Brambles rent the flesh.
But this King (whom wee call barbarous, though from his example wee may learne many great and good things) knowing that the true care of a Prince, must bee euer the publique good; and the capablenesse of his ruling, would bee iudged by his true Iustice, and election of his Mi∣nisters, and distribution of his fauour vpon the worthi∣est (which also should make a worthy vse of it) The next day that hee sate in iudgement, hee called the Gouernour: then hauing told him that hee which had liued with him in the time of his greatest calamity, must needes bee so well acquainted with the inwardnesse of his disposition, that all the world would imagine, as Princes euer are ex∣amples of good or euill to their subiects; so they are most to those which are neereliest conuersant with them. And ac∣cording to that opinion, hee had giuen him his autho∣rity, for the great fauour and confidence hee reposed in him, that hee knew well the errour which they had both committed, the one not making a true iudgement of the others disposition. That the transgression of Lawes, and Orders in any State, was the first naturall corruption which grew in it: to prouide for which, good Princes did both watchfully industriate themselues, and dispersed part of the care, which grew too great for themselues, to the trust they had in the vertue of their Ministers, who should euer, as the very greatest and truest causes, beware of those cour∣ses of Iustice, which should bee of least terrour, and procure themselues and their Princes most hatred, which was to pill the subiects goods: a thing of no example, but to euill, and of infinite odiousnesse, especially when there was no iust cause why any sort of punishment should bee inflicted. And because these acts, of so great a Minister, as hee was, both for the place hee held of authority, and fa∣uour with him; might giue the world cause to suspect his owne inclination; the which since no former example
could make him knowe, hee would now shew the world, and teach him, that the wickednesse of Princes, and great Men, are worse in the example, thn in the fault; since, by the euill custome of the world to follow them, they generate great corruptions by the imitation of others. And because in a man of his place, there could bee no more wicked acts then hee had committed; nor, in a Prince, nothing more proportionable with his place, nor fitter for his security, then the chastisement of such wicked acts; And if hee should pardon so great extortions, and sce∣lerate wronges as hee had inflicted vpon the poore peo∣ple, committed to his charge, besides, that hee should verifie the worst suspicions men might haue of him, he should, by so ill a president, trouble the mindes of his whole state, cast many good men, and their goods, into ruine; multiply the like, or worse scandals, oppressing the causes of Iustice; and so draw into the world, with∣out shame or feare, all sort of excesses: this should bee his iudgement;The King of Persiacs iudge∣ment vpon a Extortioner. That all his Goods, and Lands, should bee sold, for the satisfaction of those men, whom hee had spoyled: And if any thing wanted, since the King, by giuing him that Authority, was partly the cause of those excesses, hee condemned himselfe to pay the re∣sidue out of his Treasury. That if any thing aduanced, it should be giuen to his Children, with a grieuous E∣dict, that no succour should bee ministred vnto himselfe. For that, since Death was a concluder of his offence, shame, and the memory of it, hee should not dye; but goe, during his life, with a great yoke, like a Hogges∣yoke, about his necke, haue his Nose and Eares cut off, and haue no charitable releefe from any, but what hee gained with his owne hands: that he might feele in him∣selfe the misery which poore men haue to get, and what a sinne it is to rent from them by violent extor∣tion,
the birth of their sweat and labour. This Iudgement strooke a mighty amazement into all the great men present, and gaue an infinite ioy and comfort to the people. The Turkes Embassadour, which was there, after he had stood silent a great while, as a man halfe distracted, sware publikely, that hee saw before his eyes, his maisters ruine: being impossible that such fortune and vertue, as the king was accompanied with, could re∣ceiue any obstacle. That night hee made Marganobeagus Gouernour of Casbin, beeing well admonished by that great example of his duty. Constantino, a braue yong Gentleman, being a Christian of Georgia, hee called Mirza, and gaue him the gouernement of Hisphaan; and mee also hee called Mirza:Sir Anthony ade a Mirza. telling mee, that hee would prouide condigne∣ly for mee. And because hee had an vrgent occasion to goe post to Cassan, I should receiue his pleasure by Marganobeague; who brought mee, the next morning, a thousand Tomanas,The rich pre∣sent sent him by the King. which is sixteene thousand Duc∣kets of our Money: fortie horses all furnished; two with exceeding rich Saddles, plated with gold, and set with Rubies and Turkesses, the rest either plated with siluer, or veluet embroidered, and guilt; sixteene Moyles; twelue Cammels, laden with Tents, and all furniture both for my house and voyage; telling mee withall, that this was but a small demonstration of the Kings fauour, by which I might (notwithstanding) conceiue what better hopes I might gather: And that it was his Ma∣iesties pleasure I should follow him to Cassan: In the house where I was I should leaue a keeper, beeing his Maiesties pleasure to bestowe it on mee: and that there were ten Courtchies which should attend me the next mor∣ning, to serue mee in my iourney. All this while I moued nothing to the King of that
which was the maine purpose of my comming, both be∣cause I had no fit opportunity; and if I had, yet it was too soone: and besides, it was too great a businesse to ex∣pose, without such an occasion as might helpe my good in∣tention, with the goodnesse of it selfe. Moreouer, though I knew little; yet so much I knew, that in handling with Princes especiall affaires, of such momentuall importance, I ought not so much to re∣pose my selfe vpon the good, and iust property of my proposition, as in the direct knowledge of the nature of the Prince; who either might grow iealous of the ha∣zard, or hauing his ambitions turned to other ends, might mistake, or not regard my aduertisements. Both which would haue beene the ruine of what I intended: A businesse hardly rising againe, and recouering grace, which hath beene once foiled. Therefore I tooke time to deeme by the proceeding of other deliberations, of the way which I should take; and to make my selfe learned in the purpose of his actions, by his nature, and inclination; besides, not onely to get, first a kinde of possession in his owne affection, but of all his great men; especially of those whom I did imagine would bee best and strongest assisters of my purpose: which I did iudge to bee Oliuer di-Can, his Generall, and Xa-Tamas Coolibeague, both which were Georgians; and though they were made Ma∣hometans by the father of the King, to whom they were brought young, yet they had euer Christians hearts, and infinitely well-inclined to all those things which might promoue the Christians enterprizes, publique∣ly wishing well to their proceedings, and taking all offered occasions, to giue them honour and reputa∣tion. Then Constantino Mirza, who was a Christian, and in great fauour with the King: Yet for all this, that I meant
to make those the maine helpers of my designe, I left no sort of fashion forgotten which might procure mee fauour from all the other: though I soone found their appearances answered not with their mindes, which were onely contained from ill demonstrations against mee, by the Kings fauour to mee, and their feare of offen∣ding him; not onely through the ordinary enuy which followeth all Courts, but by the great hatred which they had to the very name of a Christian, beeing in their soules Turkes: though not daring to palesate it for their owne certaine danger. For the king knowing how potent a vniter of mens mindes the selfe-same Religion is for the tranquility of an Estate: and the like dis-vniter seuerall Religions are for the disturbance of the peace of an Estate, hee is excee∣ding curious and vigilant to suppresse, through all his Do∣minions, that Religion of Mahomet, which followeth the interpretation of Vssen and Omar, and to make his people cleaue to that of Aly: Not (as I iudge) through any Conscience, which carrieth him more to the one then the other; but first to extirpate intrinsicke factions, then to secure himselfe the more firmely a∣gainst the Turke, who beeing head of that part which fol∣loweth Omar and Vssen, should haue too powerfull a way into his Countrey, if his peoples hearts were in∣clined vnto him by the force of Religion. Therefore hee doth not onely striue to roote it out, but to defile it, and make it odious; hauing in vse, once a yeare, with great solemnity, to burne publiquely, as maine Here∣tiques, the Images of Vssen and Omar: then doth hee cause his great men publiquely (in scorne of their insti∣tution) to goe with a Flagon of Wine, carryed by a Foote-man, and at euery Village, or where they see a∣ny Assembly of people, to drinke; which himselfe also
vseth, not for the loue of the Wine, but to scandalize so much more the contrary Religion: that by such a kinde of prophaning of it, they may weare the respect of it out of the peoples heartes: Which when it fayleth with reuerence in Religion, the pillers thereof are vtter∣ly broken. Yet (as I say) there are of the very grea∣test, exceeding precise Turkes, if they durst do other for their owne fortune sake, then couer, with all artifice, that infection. Ten dayes I was betweene Casbin and Cassan, where arriued, I receiued more gracious demonstrations from the King, then I could hope for, or wish: beeing farre be∣yond my present merit, and my iudgement how to deserue it at all. Foure dayes his Maiestie stayed there, after my com∣ming; in which time there passed many Triumphes at giuoco-di-canna in the day, & good fire-works in the night: at which I was euer present with himselfe, with no lesse respect, then if I had been his brother, as he also called me, and continued that name afterward, all the time of my be∣ing in Persia. The second day of his Iourney, from thence, to∣wardes Hisphaan, hee called mee vnto him, my Bro∣ther and my Interpreter; and (after some few discourses) hee began to tell vs the whole history of those his for∣tunes which I haue discoursed: and ioyned that hee vn∣derstood, the Turke had sent him a faire sword (hee did beleeue) to cut off his head withall, if Ferrat Cans trea∣son had well succeeded: for after the Messenger arri∣ued at Tauris, vnderstanding how God his great proui∣dence, had not onely mightely preserued, but giuen him that famous victory ouer his enemies, he had sent for new order to Constantinople, which came to no other end, but to call him back againe. But the best was, the more
the Prince hated him, the more his subiects loued him, hauing receiued newes at Cassan, of ten thousand soules of Courdins which had abandoned their possessions vnder the Turke, and required some waste land of him to inhabit in; which he had giuen them. And though this discourse opened somewhat largely the Kings heart vnto mee, I durst bee no bolder, at that time, then to say, It was euer, almost impossible to pre∣serue a quyet amity betweene two so great Potentates, as himselfe, and the Turke; especially beeing so neere neighbours: that I doubted not, but his Maiesty, in his great wisedome, prouided his Counsell and strength al∣wayes ready against any danger which might grow from him, of which there was no present doubt, as long as hee was so powerfully diuerted by the warres of Hunga∣ry; which if they were ended, I saw no Obligation of faith, or any thing else, which could secure his Maiesty from those Armes, which had beene euer so ready a∣gainst his State, in all occasions; especially now that his Maiesties vertue, and fortune ministred to the Turkes will too great maine causes; First to stop the course of his too fast rising greatnesse, which hee could by no reason wil∣lingly suffer; Then to recouer his reputation, which his Maiesty had taken from him, by assubiecting the Tartars, which were vnder his protection. And if with both these hee saw his subiects also fall from him to his Maiesty, in so great troopes, it might bee a mighty effectuall wor∣king-reason to hasten him to a conclusion, vpon indiffe∣rent tearmes of those warres in Hungary; his Maiesty be∣ing much more dangerous vnto him, not onely through his power, the reputation of his late victories, and such a floud of fortune, ioyned to his great vertue and wisdome, but also by the symbolizing of religiō, which would more facilitate an entry into his state, then the sword, when there
should grow no more mutation in the maine points of gouernement, lawes, nor orders, but the person of the Prince onely. The obstinate warres, and resistances of the progresse of the one and the other, betweene the Turkes and the Christians, grew from the maine alterations of all Lawes, Orders, and forme of gouernment, with the vtter ruine of the conquered, being so diuerse in all those; and more in the principall point of religion, by which he was euermore assured of vs, generally infestuous to the very apprehension of his Subiects. But his Maiesty, from whom there was none of these generall dangers, was, questionlesse, the more perticularly feared by him: And euer hee that is feared wrongeth his iudgement, if hee liue into great and carelesse security. I concluded, it would please his Maiesty to pardon me that I said so much, that if I had erred, it was in my iudgement, not in my zealous affection vnto him; neither had I presumed to looke into such high matters, if his Maiesty, by his discourse, had not directed my sight; which if it had bene amisse, his Maie∣sties benignity and great wisedome could pardon the fault, for the true affection which caused it. He answered, that he was so far from mis-liking my li∣berty of speech that he thanked me for it, desiring me to continue it. For Princes (said hee) are, indeed more then men, when they find faithfull friends which will freely ad∣uise them; and lesse them men when they are without such: the brightnesse of their greatnesse so dimming their sight, that they haue much more neede of helpe, then priuate men; who being conuersant in all things, gather experience of euery thing, which a Prince cannot haue; Nature, onely, bringing forth a man, his perfection following by his owne vertue, learning and experience; the two first a Prince might haue, the last hardly, and euer vnperfect. Which made him euer carefully desire such, friends, as might minister a
faithfull helpe to that defect; but because we are now in iourney we shall leaue those things for a more reposed time, to be spoken of at Hisphaan, where we shall haue leasure enough both to deliberate and resolue of some good things; and with that called some other, who enter∣tained him with discourses of Hunting, and Hauking, in which he is much delighted, and vseth them with great magnificence: Neuer going to any of those sports, but that he carrieth forth aboue fiue hundred dogges, and as many Hauks, nothing rising before him but it is game. For flies he hath sparrowes; for Birds, Hobbies and Marlins; for the greatest sort some Hawke or other; and for Roe∣deare Eagles; hee hath particular Agaes for his Hawkes and Dogges, and other Officers to them a great number. The next day, I singled out Oliuer Di-Can, with whom, (after a few complements) I communicated the Kings dis∣course with me, of his first troubles, and latter fortunes; extolling his Maiesty as it was fit; and besides, giuing the greatest honour to himselfe, without flattery, that I could deuise; then I told him of my answere to the King, and on purpose I said, I feared, that it might turne to my harme, being newly planted in the Kings fauour, subiect to the enuy of the Court, and wanting a tongue to speake for my selfe: and that to entermeddle in so great and perri∣lous matters, it could not choose but awake some couered malice, to take occasion to worke me some damage. But my confidence was such, first in the Heroycke minde of the King himselfe, then in the generous disposition of his excellency, that I should bee protected from perill for this fault, as I would preserue my selfe with more cautel heereafter. Hee answered me, that the Kings affection vnto me was such, that no man durst lift vp a thought against me: which the Court knew well. For himselfe, as he knew not
the conditions of our Courts, so I might mistake those of theirs: if enuy bare so great a sway with vs, wee had lighter Princes, and men of more presumption. In this Court there was not a Gentleman but the King: the rest were shadowes which moued with his body. But in this which I had said to the King, if I had entended it, to moue him to warre in so fit a time against the Turke, I had done well; and assured mee that both he, and Xa-Ta∣mas-Coolibeague would with all their powers concurre with me to bring it to an essentiall deliberation; though, said he, there be three dogges, Haldenbeague, Bastan-Aga, and Courtchy Bassa, that will mainely oppose themselues against it: yet in the conscience of my duty, which I owe to his Maiesty, I assure my selfe, that there is no se∣cure way, either for the preseruation of his person, or state, but that. Therefore since you haue begunne in so hap∣py an houre, to breake the Ice of so great and so good an enterprise, follow it without feare, since God will prosper your good intention in it, and we will second you, with all the strength and industry which wee haue. This was all which I desired, to be assured of some friend; es∣pecially such a one, as might haue both opinion and cre∣dite of wisedome and fauour with the King. For being a stranger, if I had vndertaken the bearing of so weighty a businesse my selfe alone, I should hardly haue escaped the being ouer-weighed with it, knowing that the best proposi∣tions haue euer oppositions, mens humours neuer concurring all to one end, and the nature of men being alwaies opposite to a strangers aduancement: Which since it must proceed in such a place from a speciall act of his owne vertue, which could neuer be produced without a subiect to worke by, the next way to wash away insensibly such a growing repu∣tation, was to keep me from any other meanes of establish∣ment, then bare Fauor, which as it is very transitory in priuate
men, so is it much more in Princes; the volubility of whose na∣tures maketh them easily glutted, and most mutable in their kinds of satisfaction: and if once I had declined in the height of my fortune, I knew there was no bayting place, etweene mediocrity, and precipitation: so dangerous are the aies of Princes, and all men so foolish to striue to runne  them. The Kings entrance into Hisphaan was there of the same fashion that it was at Cassan; differing onely in this, that for some two English miles, the waies were couered all with Veluet, Sattin, and cloth of Gold, where his orse should passe. After hee had bene setled there foure∣eene daies, remembring what Oliuer Di-Can had said vn∣to me, I determined to loose no more time, but to try the vttermost of my fortune, in bringing to a resolution, that enterprise; the imagination of which, had cost mee so much time, and so much danger; and was the chiefe mouing-cause at the first, and now the onely mouing cause of comming thither. And I was the more encouraged to do it by the fresh memory of God his mighty pro∣uidence ouer me past, and by the exceeding great fauour of the King; which I knew to be his great worke, who mo∣ueth the hearts of Princes to make them instruments of his iudgements, which by all apparant demonstrati∣ons, I conceiued, determined against the Turke: There∣fore taking the opportunity of the Kings being alone with me and my brother in a Garden, with my Interpreter onely and Xa-Tamas-Coolibeague, I spake vnto him to this effect;ir. Antony heres per∣wasiue to the , to ke warre gainst the . That my affection, growne onely vpon the fame of his Maiesty, had guided me from a farre Countrey into his presence; by which I found his royall vertues, so far ex∣ceeding the relation which I had heard, that as I did ad∣mire them, so I had a kind of forceable mouing in my na∣ture to desire condigne fortunes to accompany them: Be∣sides,
my particular obligation to his Maiesty was so great, that I was bound, not onely, to say what I thought fit for his seruice; but to do as much, as my life might ac∣complish for the same. More-ouer being emboldned by his royall gracious answer vnto me vpon the way, (which I did take for a kind of commandement) I would presume to say some-thing more largely then I did then, of that which I tooke to concerne his Maiesty, as much as any thing else could. Neither would I speake any thing of other condition, then such, as he in his great iudgement should find so well grounded; that nothing could bee ad∣ded, either to the iust cause, honour, vtility, or facility of the enterprise, which I would propose. And because I would cleare all clouds, which might hang about it, my selfe which propounded it, was such, that I was onely a shadow, which, by the vrging of my owne nature, and de∣light, should follow the body of his victories, rather then haue, or hope, for any other perticular interest in them my selfe. For the first points, There could no deliberation bee grounded vpon a greater foundation of equity, then that which had his end onely directed to the recouery of that, which was by force and violence vsurped from his State: nor no∣thing more honourable for a Prince then to bee able, without hazard, not onely to reuenge priuate and publicke wrongs; but to recouer their members againe to his seates, by his wisedome and vertue, which haue bene separate either by the defect, or fortune of his Predecessors; All this, both publicke and priuate profite, followed so great an encrease of State (in∣creasing in all points the force of his State) and his poore Subiects, which were throwne out of their possessions, either through their true deuotion to his Maiesty, which could giue them no peace vnder another gouerne∣ment, or through the extreme tyranny of the Turke, should be recouered againe to their owne, with his infi∣nite
glory, and vtility. The facility shewed it selfe diuers waies; principally in his owne fortune, wisedome, and ver∣tue; against which, there was no likely resistance, especial∣ly when there was no equall obstacle; then the reputation of his late victories, ioyned with the other, would find, or make a way through all difficulties; then his Militia which was fresh and vncorrupted; then the incapacity of the Turke, his corruptions of gouernment, want of obe∣dience, sundry rebellions, and distractions from any possibility of being able to make any potent resistance against his Maiesties proceedings, by his warres in Hunga∣ry, which his Maiesty might assure the continuance of; if it pleased him to inuite the Princes Christian to his amity, which hee should offer vpon that condition: by which also, hee should receiue one other worthy benefite fit for such excelling parts, as hee was most richly a∣boundant in, not to conclude the true knowledge of them, in that one corner of the world: but with making these great Princes knowne vnto himselfe, hee should make his owne worthinesse, like-wise, knowne vnto them. Neither, (as I said at the first to his Maiesty) though these were great points to moue so high a spirit, intending to glory, and great things, as his was, that they were so im∣portant as other were. For these might either be defer∣red, or not at all acted, being bound vnto them by no greater necessity then his owne will, counselled by good reason. But his case was such, that hee must re∣solue, both for the security of his estate and person, to make or endure a warre. As I was proceeding, Haldenbeague the Viseire, Bastan∣Aga, and Oliuer Di-Can came in: the King presently called them, and told them what I was propounding vnto him; vpon which, the Viseire swelling against me, answered instantly.
Your Maiesty may now perceiue that true which some of your seruants haue beene bold to tell you,The Vscive diswaue  position. at the first comming of these Christians, and many times since, that they were sent to disquiet your Maiesties tran∣quility of your state; and to embarke you in dangerous enterprises for others interresses. For what likely-hood was there, that a Gentleman of quality, without some great disaster fallen him, should take such a voyage, so full of dangers and expences, vpon a fame of a Prince, spread by ordinary Merchants? Since I know, hee could neuer haue spoken with men of better quality in those parts, which could haue knowne your Maiesty: And if it were true, that such a motion, onely, had brought him; why should hee not giue time to the growing of his better fortunes, by your Maiesties Munificencies and fauours; without drawing himselfe into the danger, to bee a perswader of a perrilous enterprise: then which, hee cannot bee so ignorant, as to vnderstand no way to bee so precipitious for himselfe; But because it is inioy∣ned him, hee must do it; without regard to your Ma∣iesty, to whom hee is onely, newly, bound, for present be∣nefites; which hee careth but to enioy, vntill he hath in∣tangled you in his designes: and then will hee relye vpon those, to whom hee oweth greater obedience, for more permanent benefits, and greater through so great a merite. God keepe your Maiestly from giuing care to his perswa∣sions, which carry nothing with them but extreme peril: The Turke hauing bene a heauy neighbour to your Ma∣iesties state, when it was found through a long peace, and when your Predecessours were aboundant in money, which is the heart of the warres, and the sinewes which bind together an estate. Your Maiesty hath now a cer∣taine peace with him, and that the more certaine through his necessity, which assureth you of time to gather trea∣sure
and all kind of strength against him, if hee should breake the faith of his truce, or moue against you hereaf∣ter. That it is iust, honourable, and profitable for your Maiesty, perhaps I may agree; though it bee a question, whether it be iust, or honourable, to breake a peace, with∣out a iust occasion giuen. But howsoeuer, it is more wise∣dome for your Maiesty to find a better, and more fit time which shall furnish you with all necessary prouisions for so great an enterprise: And further, I say, if the Turkes gouernement bee corrupted, giue it more time, and the sicknesse will encrease. Is hee incapable? his yeares are too many to make him amend; therefore by giuing your selfe time, you loose nothing; he will be incapable still. But Sinan Bassa was a great name; So was Mustapha; and so was Osman; and so hath hee many now; so that his state doth neither stand nor decline, with his defects, as long as hee hath worthy men to maintaine it. His Coun∣tries are full of rebellion; These are Rumours with which wise men are neuer moued: since they grow by reportes, and diminish by experience. And if they bee true, let him consume with his owne malady: and your Maie∣sties designes, (whensoeuer you shall resolue of them) will passe with the more facility. How dangerous a thing it is to embrace diuers and continuall action, your Ma∣iesties greatest wisedome can better tell you then I; your Tartars haue but newly felt the offence of your Armes; they are farre from being well tasted, or at all secured with your Maiesties gouernement: Beginne a warre with the Turke, (in which must bee ingaged the vttermost of your strength) what other opinion is to be had of them, but that, like old enemies, and freshly more then euer offended they will rebell, and infest you with the greatest resolutions that extreme enemies can? And againe, Where is your Maiesties treasure? where is your munition? and where is
your Artillery: all which must bee had for a warre; and though your fortune, and the nature of the country (which hath no strong places) did not require them against the Tartars, yet of necessity, you must haue them against the Turke, who hath a Fortresse in Tauris, Tifflis and Vannes, strong places; and neuer moueth his Armies, but full of Artillery: which you must also haue, if you meane to pro∣ceed honourably, and with condigne fortune against him. Moreouer, for you to send, and begge an Amity of the Christian Princes, what a sit perswasion is it for your Ma∣iesties greatnesse? which notwithstanding, if you were compelled by necessity, somewhat from your selfe, yet ne∣cessity would make it tollerable: But for you to seeke them which haue need of you, there is so litle reason, that he hath sinned against your power, person, and state, which hath propounded it. Your Maiesty may, in your too great be∣nignity, passe ouer your iust indignation for such acoun∣cell: but we know what it meriteth. There is behinde you, Lar, and Ormus, the one a king∣dome fomentated as a bar between you and the Portugals: and the other, which is vsurped, from a king anciently tri∣butary to your predecessors. Whilst your Maiesty maketh your selfe ready for the greater, begin with the lesser en∣terprise. Nothing will giue you more honour then that; First, to vindicate those places, in which your religiō is op∣pressed; and by that, iustifie the more whatsoeuer you shal enterprize. If this Christian can giue you these; if he can giue you aboundance of all other wants, if he can giue you Hostages from his Kings, that they shall not in Hungary a∣lone, but in other places also, fasten vpon that huge body of the Turke; and that they shall neither make peace nor truce with him, except your Maiesties consent concurre, that nothing may be defectiue in so great an action: And
that your Maiesty may be secure, that the weight of all shal not wholly fall vpon your selfe; then your Maiesty shall haue some foundation to deliberate on. Otherwise, I thinke neither his perswasions to be harkened to, nor himselfe to be retained: who sheweth by his sudden beginning, that no fauour, grace, nor benefits from your Maiesty, can acquiet his mind from stirring you against your owne peace, tran∣quillity and security of your state and person. Persian nerall his swere to the s disswa∣e.Oliuer di-Can answered, that there was difference between a proposition which was only moued to be councelled of, and a perswasion. That he thought I councelled nothing, (much lesse perswaded) but onely propounded that to the king, which if it were not then fit to bee executed, for rea∣sons that I knew not in the present condition of the kings affaires; yet I deserued not so bitter a censure: since Princes ought to heare all, and elect the best; and for that elections sake, to animate all to speake freely. And because it hath pleased his Maiesty to giue you, and me, and all of vs, leaue to speake, as it is all our duties to say what wee thinke: so our places are of such a condition, that our powers are nothing in resoluing: but onely in discoursing before his Maiesty, those things which in the truth of our consciences, wee thinke meetest for his seruice. And if conuenient and ne∣cessary things be propounded, by a Christian, by a Iew, or by the worst man liuing; not onely in religion, but the very disposition of his life, I see no cause why you, nor I, nor any should reiect that which is good for the illes sake; since Princes must, and ought, make their benefite of all men: not re∣garding what they are, but how they may serue them. This Christian hath come from farre, and through great dan∣gers (he faith) through his affection, growing from the ex∣celling fame of his Maiesty; and should not I thinke, that his glory is worthy to be carried as farre as tongues of men goe? And shall not I thinke, also, that a Merchant speaking
of his vertues, is not inabled beyond his spirit, raised by such a subiect, to shew it like it selfe, not like his owne Merchandize? And why should I iudge him sent by any, when hee hath not assumed to himselfe the honour, digni∣ty, nor priuiledges of an Embassdour in a strange Coun∣trey, where no man would neglect any thing which might aduance his quality, or security? But hee hath onely put himselfe vpon the Kings fauour; and what hee hath pro∣posed, hath proceeded rather from a minde, to merit by some good act, that fauour, then a demonstration of o∣ther dependance: for hauing giuen himselfe to the king, to serue him without limitation of time, but as long as it shal please his Maiesty to serue himselfe of him, hee sheweth plainely, that hee hath included his hope of fortune, and benefite by this, or any other action, within the compasse only of his Maiesties gracious benignity. And seruing his Maiesty in this, or any other imployment, which his Maie∣sty will vouchsafe to make vse of him, If he do it as a stran∣ger, he hath no hope, but in the merit of his owne vertue, which must be discerned and rewarded by his maiesty; if he serue as a Prince of his Maiesty (as now by his great mag∣nificency hee beareth the title and place; the same vertue must euer confirme and aduance his fauour, and the same king must iudge and reward it. And this I haue said in a double duty; first, to maintaine the act of his Maiesties great iudgment, which cannot mistake it selfe in the distri∣bution worthily of his fauors; then in that of hospitality, to answere iustly for a Gentleman, come to our home, where wee are all bound to defend him from wrong: especially bearing about him so great a priuiledge as a true affection to our king. But now to speake of the proposition, the Viseirs obiections against it: as I do thinke them worthy of so wise a man; yet because particular factions doe sometimes
blinde men, both in councelling, and deliberating: So questi∣onlesse his great iudgement hath beene much clouded with some of those; which haue made him erre directly in the iudgement of some things; and to misconceiue of the maine purpose generally of the proposition. For no mans intention is to be iudged to stretch beyond possibility: So that whatsoeuer was propounded to his Maiesty as neces∣sary, honourable, and profitable for him, and his state, in∣cluded withall that well-vnderstanding intention, that it would please his maiesty to prouide, in the firmnesse of his wisedome and councell, condignely for it: if he want trea∣sure, to gather it; if he want munition & Artilery, to make quantity of both: which must indeed require a time for the act; not the resolution vpon the act. Without which his Maiesty (as he shal haue no great cause himselfe) & his Mi∣nisters will be lesse diligent in the expedition of all such prouisions; of which (to say the truth) that huge masse of money is of least importance; his Maiesty beeing able to make in the time of this Turkes distraction (and if his whole power were also vnited) a sufficient Army of his Timarri, and such as hee already payeth, vpon the Fron∣tier, to proceede with any great designe against him. For admit hee should (vpon the mouing of the Kings Ar∣mies) come to any foule conditions of peace in Hunga∣ry, as it is vnlike that hee will; yet there must bee so much time betweene the proposition and concluding of the peace, and remouing of his Army thence, and trans∣porting it hither, that any great thing will bee first ef∣fected, before any obstacle will appeare against it. But in reason, hee should rather endure any vnreasonable losse this way, then the least there: For (besides that his principall parts are altogether disposed on that side; in so much that the danger of Hungary doth extend it selfe to Constantinople) Wee are euen of the selfe same,
or little different religion, so that the warres cannot pro∣ceed with a mortall hatred and desire of extirpation, which beareth with it so much the lesse danger: and as it is the more facile to be satisfied, so easier and lesse perillous condi∣tions will euer end it. That Tauris, Tistis, Vannes, are strong places, I do not denie it; but withal I know that the strength of no place can maintain it selfe against the power & furie, and the ordinarie miseries brought by the wars, without a certaine succour; which I cannot see how they can be confi∣dent of. The Tartars you say are newly conquered, and will rebell with such a great opportunitie: surely I take that opportunitie the onely direct meanes to answere them, no∣thing breeding discontentments to a dangerous breaking forth, so much as idlenesse, and the continuall sight of that which they take to be their oppression. Therefore his Maiestie hauing an Armie of thirty thousand men there, and from thence draw∣ing forth thirtie thousand Tartars of the best able for the warres, the Prouince must be most assured; the meanes and chiefe actors of innouation being in his Maiesties Armie; and their wiues, children, and parents, in pawne with their countrey for their true seruing his Maiestie in his warres: which he did think so necessarie for the King to vndertake, that he made no difference betweene putting his state in extreme perill, and the not vndertaking of them; coun∣selling his Maiestie to doe in that point, as all wise Prin∣ces vse to doe, not onely to haue regard to the present euils but to the future, and to repaire them with all industrious prouidence: because that by seeing them, and preuenting them a farre off, the remedie might be applied with great facilitie and good effect; but by expecting them vntill they beare downe all by their great waight with them, their cure will be taken & vsed out of time, the sicknesse being growne to incurable tearmes: as the Physitions say of the Hecticke seauer, which in his first entrance into the bodie is easie to
be cured and hard to be knowne, but through the continu∣ance of time with the rancor of the disease by not hauing known it, & applied remedie in the beginning, it changeth the first order, and groweth it selfe facile to be knowne and impossible to be remedied: so doth it occurre in matters of state; for fore-seeing with wise prouidence, the euils which rise toward it, there is no difficultie in auoiding them; but when from either neglect or ignorance of preuenting them they palisate themselues to euery mans vnderstanding, there is no more remedie familiar with our reason securely auail∣able against them. Which maketh me bee bold to say, that since the inconueniences which his Maiestie must suffer by the Turke are so apparant, he must resolue and strengthen his minde and meanes to remoue them, and not to giue them greater power to follow him by auoyding a warre: since you may know that the warre cannot be absolutely taken away, but deferred only with the enemies aduantage. Neyther will I euer be aduised by that which is alwaies in the mouth of the wise men of these daies, which is to enioy the benefit of time; but will say and euer thinke, that Euery Prince, and euery man should make vse of his owne vertue and wisdom, seeing time driuing euery thing before it doth ordinari∣ly produce as often good as ill, & ill as good. And why it should at any time diminish the reputation of his Maiesties great∣nesse to inuite the Princes Christian to so honourable and great an action, I cannot discern, when it is one of the greatest foundations of a Princes reputation to raise himselfe to the grea∣test enterprises, in which his iudgement may not be mistaken in the possibilitie of effecting them. And since it is necessary for his Maiestie to combine himselfe with them for his owne strength and reputation, if eyther he attempt the Turke, or be attempted by him, why should it not bee more honou∣rable and more facile for him, for the accomplishment of his ends, to speake vnto them in their necessitie (if there be
any of eyther part) and so to linke himselfe the stronglier with them by such a bond; then in his owne necessitie, in which condition there is a great question whether he shall be heard. Lastly, how strange a conclusion you haue made, I will desire you to behold with better consideration. You will not haue the King to make warre with the Turke, to a∣uoid expence of money and munition, where the best parts and most plentifull of both countries are confining, which would giue abundance, and cheaper liuing to an Armie; but you will haue him go to Larre, to Ormus, sterile coun∣tries farre remoued, where the charges onely of supplying victuals to an Armie, would be of more cost then all other munition and expence of the Armie besides. And besides; there is no danger of the King of Spain, who hath euer held a fashion of maintaining himselfe rather then encreasing. Besides the nature of his force is of a contrarie qualitie to giue vs feare of his too great inlargement, hauing neither abundance of horse nor men, but only gallies which assure his forts, with which also he is sufficiently contented. And how wearying out a warre to his Maiesties treasure, and men, that must be where he must fight but at the enemies pleasure and aduantage, the strength of his enemie stan∣ding vpon the Sea, in which the King hath no sort of shew of power, he submitted to his Maiesties wisest considera∣tion: besides the infinite danger by the nature of the lying of the state of the Turkes and the King of Spaines, and the essentiall of their potenties were of such a condition, that whatsoeuer was diminished from his Maiesties, or the King of Spaines, was an absolute addition to the Turke; who by that aduantage of the weakening each others for∣ces, should haue a more facile entrie vpon any one or both of them. And that it was wel proued by his Maiesties prede∣cessors, that there was not a more maine vpholder of the beginning, and foundation of their state nor manner
of preseruing it (which was all they could doe) then that league which vnited both their forces euer against the com∣mon enemie. And now that God and the great vertue of his Maiestie had so augmented the limits of his dominion, that he had power ioyned with true iustice and necessitie, to recouer those vsurped Prouinces which the Turke held from him (In which action nothing could more secure him, then first, an assured relatiue friendship betweene the Princes Christian and him generally, and particularly the forces of the King of Spaynes by Sea in those parts) it should be a strange Counsell to perswade his Maiestie to make warre with him whom he had euer profited by, and to offend all in offending him; and voluntarily to inble the Turke in whatsoeuer hee would vndertake against him: which must needs be by all reason & iudgement his enemy. Which made him beseech his Maiestie to continue that so commodious friendship vnto him, and to strengthen himselfe with new, to fomentate those rebellions, which were no rumours, (one of those that were in Armes being Moombaregue a Prince tributarie to his Maiesty; the others, though no men of great qualitie, yet of great happinesse in their proceedings) and to prouide for all things necessary for so great an enterprise: for which, though the Vicesire were otherwise perswaded, nothing did more facilitate the iudgement of his good successe, then the Prince of the Turkes owne incapacitie; Nothing hauing euer beene proued more certaine, then that the Ministers of any Prince do euer sym∣bolize with their Masters vertues or vices; and that men of ex∣traordinary vertue with them, haue euer little power, or little time: suspition being the best preseruer of their defects, which e∣uer aymeth at those who haue more vertue then themselues, as fearing them most. A discourse proued true by the mise∣rable end of all those named, and by many examples which he would leaue vnrehearsed, as things that neuer
bare more credit then the faith of the hearer gaue them. And so left off, humbly beseeching his Maiesty to pardon his bold∣nes and freenes which were euer the birth of true zealous deuotiō: he had onely expressed what he thought, his Maiesty might please to resolue of that hee thought honourable, secure, and profitable for his state and person. The causes of his danger from the Turke he spake not of, first touched by me, and apparant to all. The king then commāded Baslan-Aga to speake freely also what he thought, who after a reuerence vnto him, hauing repeated the arguments past, commen∣ded them all (as it is his fashion apparantly to offend no bodie: but what he doth in that qualitie is secretly) and then as though he meant no such matter, diuiding what he would speak into two points,The great Chamberlai speech. the warre, and my person, he proceeded thus. This proposition by the wisedome of his Maiesty resting doubtful, so that none of vs by knowing which way his owne disposition inclineth, haue any sort of constraint, either by fearing to oppose our opinions against what his will intended, or by a desire to raise our iudge∣ments into a better conceit of fuour, by making them to symbolize with his, giueth vs so great libertie of delibera∣tion, that if we speake not well to the purpose, at least we shall speake truly what we thinke. I say then that all warres are eyther made vpon the Confines of the States which moue them: or farre from the Confines of the maker of them, by penetrating further into the maine bodie of him vpon whom they are made. And it is not possible for any to vse great Armes or small a long time, which haue not a fountaine of great reuenewes from at home, and a foundation of great plentie in the field. For as without sinewes the members of this compact of our bodie cannot moue; and if they doe, shew a stirring onely, for a testimonie of their life, which may be in them; yet that mouing is vnperfect both in vi∣gour and continuance: So Armes neyther can be ga∣thered,
neyther can they be appropriated to necessarie des∣signes, nor maintained vnited in any enterprize without a Riuer of money which may refresh them in conuenient time, and make swimme after them munitions, victualles, and other necessarie prouisions both for the sustenance of euery particular bodie, and importing to the good purpose and effect of the mannagement of their Armes. And be∣cause the reuenewes of iust and good Princes, (as the fa∣culties of the subiects from whom they are deriued) are li∣mited; and drawing without measure for one yeare or two huge quantities of money out of their estates, their coun∣tries will remaine poore and exhausted of gold and siluer. From whence proceedeth that warres of such a condition as cannot be ended neere at hand, but draw (through the necessitie of perfecting them well when they are once be∣gun) the Prince and the Armie a farre off; neyther can be vndertaken nor continued, but by Princes who haue infinite treasures acumulated through long times prouidence, or neuer-ending mines (for other sort of ordinarie aboun∣dance of what greatnesse soeuer it be, will be dried vp and vanish; and a short time bringeth it to an end) the times of peace gathering by minutes that which the warre spendeth by houres: and one yeare of warre consumeth the fruits of many yeares of peace. Mustapha Bashaw, when Soliman de∣liberated of the warres which he made with our great king Ismael, told him that before he resolued of it, that there were foure torrents to be opened; the one of men, the other of victuals, the other of munition, the other of money: and in all he said well, but in the last best. For if euery sort of warre require mightie expence, questionlesse such a one doth it most, which is carried farre from your owne home, where the nourishment of your owne countrie may sub∣minister abundance and cheapnesse to your people: which the Turke proued true: for hauing vndertaken that warre
more vpon the Confidence of his resolution then good Councel, being a Prince of so great power, he so consumed his treasure that hee was compelled to abase the allay of his Gold and Siluer: and for all that to raise the price to the double value: and to comport it with the falsification of mo∣nie, and many such great inconueniencies; for which the Ia∣nizaries rushed into strange mutinies, and many perrillous successes followed: yet had he Timarri as your Maiesty hath; but whē the length & quality of the war deuoured thē faster thē their abilitie was to beare, the Prince was constrained if he would vse them, to giue them means of sustenance also: & your Maiestie which hath a state as yet exceeding feeble, and scarce recouered from a mortall sicknesse, is so much vn∣able to beare the burthen of such a warre, that by ouer weak∣ning it in drawing from it that small vital sustenance which it hath, it may (which God forbid) occasion the last ruine of it; like a sicke bodie, which aggrauated with the ill of the disease, looseth his naturall vigour. Therefore great fortunes and victories sometimes when they meete not with arude of that excellent wisdome and vertue, that is able to vse them iudi∣ciously and temperately, are the most powerfull meanes of the ruine of the Prince and state: when being carried away with the confi∣dence soly of a continuing felicitie, they embrace more then they can possibly claspe: and the mischiefes which succeede of such ill measured warres fall not only vpon the Prince, but are perni∣cious also to his poore people, when through their ambitions and cupidities they are Authors and stirrers of new perturbations. Your Maiestie hath now assured your selfe from all such ruines, as heretofore kept you from vniting your selfe ei∣ther for your defence against the Turke, or offence when your generall force might make you able for such a resolu∣tion; and that which is more, those men, which were accu∣stomably vsed against you, are added to your owne power: your wants are mony, munitions, artillarie, which you haue
time enough to prouide abundantly, by the greatnesse, vni∣tie, and wealth, of your owne Dominions: and the Turkes present distractions, troubles, and generall corruptions, which in naturall discourse are likelier to encrease by time then decrease. For Good and I'd haue in the gouernment of men this difference between themselues, that Good though it be brought forth by time, yet it is not renued by time; and though by our stu∣dies and industries it be maintained, it corrupteth not-withstan∣ding by degrees of it selfe, and finally of it selfe, also extinguisheth; as we may read and see in the succeedings of all states and of all Sects: the contrarie of which appeareth in Ill, since it doth not wast by little and little through the wearing of time, as Good doth; but rather increaseth to a more powerfull validitie, and by easie pas∣sages riseth to the extremitie of declination. So that hauing such assurance of the working of time in that qualitie with which the Turke is alreadie infected, Your Maiestie may re∣ponder and resolue at leisure of the proceeding of your en∣terprise: only prouide meanes to establish and perfect it when it shall bee concluded. This Christian hath brought with him a Founder of artillarie: let him bee vsefull to your Maiestie in something; and let vs your seruants haue the comfort to see some good fruit of your infinite magnifi∣cencie. In the meane time, by deferring your deliberation, Your Maiesty shal euer haue aduātage to determine by the progresse and successe of thinges, and so shall you either moue or stand what way soeuer you incline vnto, more surely founded. For your Maiesties sending to the Princes Christian, I giue also the same counsell to beware of er∣rour by acceleration, since if they be great, and haue neede of colligating themselues with your Maiestie (as your need of them shall neuer bee without theirs of you, both rising from the same, either the Turkes potencie to sustaine him ioyntly, or his impotencie to dissolue him ioyntly) they I say without once measuring obligations, honour done, or
benefits past, for their present interest will euer imbrace your fauour and friendship, at what time soeuer it shall bee offered. If they be Princes of no great power in themselues, their suspition, feare, and iealousie will naturally induce them to combine themselues with your Maiestie, or any Prince of a porportionable power for such an effect, for the ruine and destruction of a more powerful enemie. That this Christian doth insist to haue it done now, I cannot discerne his reason; for if his condition be good in his owne Coun∣trie, it is vnlikely that for the enioying of any other fortune he will perpetually banish himselfe from thence, and would be glad to haue such a demonstration there of his valour and fortune, to haue bin able to perswade a great King of Per∣sia to such an act: in which if the books of our former Kings erre not, many great Kings, or at least Kings, haue faied. For the present vsing of your Maiesties Souldiers to keepe them in practise and not to suffer their courage to be ouer∣come with too much and too long ease, You haue two wayes; one to change often your Armie in Corassane; the other to employ them toward Larr and these parts; which is a most iust, facile, and profitable enterprise. For taking of Larr, you shall bring those of Ormus to an acknowledge∣ment both of tribute and homage to you, which will giue a great satisfaction to your Subiects, by that beginning con∣ceiuing a hope of greater things: and bee the more assured of them and their helpe, if you neede it hereafter, by the neerer you are to preiudice them, if they should not be apt to serue you: and the expence can be nothing against a smal King, the Tymarri onely of Syraz sufficing for that enter∣prise. But as I haue said thus much by your Maiesties com∣maundement only, so I will neuer make my selfe an obsti∣nate Authour of a Councell: but humbly submit what I haue said to your Maiesties excelling iudgement, and the resolution of your determination to Gods direction, and
your wisedome; and the execution to his great prouidence and your Maiesties infinite vertue. And (laughing vpon me) sonne (said he) haue I not said true of your mind? When he had ended, I beseeched his Maiestie to vouchsafe to heare me once more; which he said was needlesse, & the day fae spent: therefore since euery man had already spoken their opinion he would also say somewhat of his owne, and re∣ferre the farther deliberation of things vntill an other time. The proposition which Mirz Antonio (saith he) made vnto me,The Kings censure & con∣ciu on o he comultation. is questonlesse in iselfe such an one, as I must not only thanke him for propounding it, by which it hath receiued life, but I must also prouide for the execution of it, that the life which it hah may be vsed to good purpose. The force of the Turke consisteth in cauallerie, infantery, gallies, ar∣tillery, munitions, money. And the cause why they procee∣ded not in their warre against this state in my fathers time, was not eyther the death of Osman Bassa, nor their diuer∣sion into Hungary, but that ancient art by the which they euer carried their warres; which hath beene alwaies to of∣fend and preuent an enemie; to vse exceeding celeriie in all their enterprises; to haue their forces in perpetuall rea∣dinesse; not to attempt two enterprises at one time, and if it were possible, not to be troubled with thē at one time; not to spend the benefit of time, and their men & treasure vpon matters of small importance: and not to continue a ware long with any, to auoid by such a meanes the informing by practise any Prince or his people in the exercise of armes. Which if it haue otherwise hapned in Hungary, it procee∣deth rather from the obstination of the Princes Christian, then from any part of his owne desire. I (said the king) want footmen, artillery, and money, which I must make readie; the Turks neuer hauing aduantage vpō my people through thir vaiour, but onely by that defect. Gallies I haue none; therefore since they must be necessary for some purpose, of
which the warres may bring forth the occasion; and per∣haps also of necessitie; and I can only hope for them of the Portugeses: it will be an ill counsell to offend them in any point, and then afterward vpon a new treatie to relie vpon them in so great a case, and in which my necessitie may also concurre. For the Turks present state, and the iudgement of his future, it is a thing facile to make, and hard to erre in; since, by the ordinarie course of the working causes of muta∣tions of states, when a gouernment doth proceed from suffering the first abuses, to confirme them in the most part of the state, a few intelligent instruments are not sufficient to beare the weight of the disorders, and to correct them; being the nature of men, when they flie from one extreeme to runn: headong without any mediocritie into another: by which the Turks extreeme obe∣dience is become a direct despisablenesse of his person and authority. And this Princes incapacity must be in this point the ruine of their state, diffusing the like infection into the members, for such as is the Prince, such are his greater mini∣sters, & such are his people. Then whether I giue my selfe time or no time, for what belongeth vnto him, that may per∣haps be all one, since his being as he is, or worse, sheweth fa∣cilitie enough for the well proceeding of any enterprise fundamentally designed against him. Yet many times gene∣rall rules faile in particular subiects, and a new Prince may & can reforme those disorders; but the time in truth which my owne wants force me to take (and not these argu∣ments which are no other then arguments) shall shew that I am not defectiue in those points, in which he is. But that which I begin shal haue the extract of it from sound coun∣sell, and the ending from as perfect vertue, if I or my people haue it. For the flame of our warre once breaking forth (be∣leeue it) will not be so facily extinguished, both, because great Princes difficilly speak of peace while they feele themselues able to make warres; and the diuersity of our religion will
striue with a more mortall rancor then contraries. There∣fore I must strengthen my selfe by all possible waies to beare the furie of it: which must be done by the inabling and augmentation of my forces, changing the orders of my owne militia, to such as are properest for the enemy which I propound to my selfe▪ establishing the gouernment of my countrie in such a sort, that the generall abundance may without the feeling of a heauie exaction replenish my trea∣sures; cause plentifull prouisions of artillerie, armes and munitions; and adde to these internal powers of my owne, those of the Princes eyther by protection or league: of which the first sort, I meane I haue alreadie the Georgians being all vnder my protection: but it is a weake helpe, I being bound by that condition to defend them vpon my charge, and they vnable to assist me, except vpon the same also. And though it be true that they bring me a fashion of reputation, yet is it such a reputation as hath no essentiall point of foundation: but onely serueth me by ignorance of the quality, in which they are vnto me, rather then in the substance and strength. Leagues are vsually of more appearance then effect, and of more splendor in the beginning, then of pro∣fit or durablenesse in the end (so many accidents causing disunion, suspition, or some other ill quality amongst con∣federates) yet when a league is made for preseruation a∣gainst the common perill rising from a potent enemie, and when diuers bodies are moued to one end, and with one consent, and not one bodie with diuers consents, and eue∣rie one of these hauing particular respect to a diuers end, and when if there be any thing acquisited the distribution of the members of that bodie is such, vpon whom the ac∣queit is to be made, that there is no possible pretendence from one to the others getting; I doe not see but that such a league must bring substantiall reputation, and gene∣rall commoditie that wil not be subiected to any common
accident of dissolution. For the Tartars which I haue as subiected if I were Oliuer Di-Chan, Hadenheagu, r Basan-Ag, I could thinke of few better meanes to assure my selfe of their rebellions, then those which they haue propoūdd: except one addition of suffering them to enioy their anci∣ent order, lawes, and their particular course of iustice. But as I am borne with a mind of another constitution, I can secure them better by giuing them to their owne na∣turall Prince, and him to them. For to whose father I was o much bound, that through the royalty of his disposition I hold my life, & had the beginning of what I am, I can do lit∣tle for the son, & no gratefull act at all for the memory of the father, if I cannot giue him a kingdom which is the least part of what I am.Th Kings  the cnsulta tion. To conclude as good deliberations in their many points, must be grounded vpon the example of the past, the experience of the present, and the iudgement of the future and the Turk hath been euer heauie to my State in long pssed, and late passd times, and is now by some ac∣cidents partly proceeding from himself, partly from others (in all liklihood) easie to be perpetually assured: which point of time that giueth so good an occasion if it be let passe, may giue him power (for a mind he can nor will neuer want) to be vntollerable againe hereafter; or if not vntolerable, at the least dangerous. We haue two great powers of our mindes, the one a wise power of vnderstanding, by which we pene∣trate into the knowledge of things; the other a strong power of resoluing, by which we execute things well vn∣derstood: and now that we haue iudged of all, we must re∣solue of somewhat; and of that which is probabliest best. Therefore our necessitie, our honour, and our iustice cal∣ling vs against the Turke, and since wih all these concur∣reth so good an opportunitie: he must be the maine end of which we will determine: and because to prepare vs to that end amongst many other circumstances, the sending to the
Princes Christian hath beene intimated as one of the most necessarie: we shall do well in the generall good vse which we must make of this interposition of time, to doe also that. For though it be true, that their interesses will euer make such a proposition acceptable: yet where there is a proffer of such a condition, as beareth with it a kinde of Obliga∣tion, as it is of mere honourable fashion for vs, so it addeth grace and reputation and more strength to it, or any such like purpose. For neither will I relie so much vpon my owne power, or fortune, or the present benefite which I meane to bestow vpon these of Corasan, that I will forget I haue offended them, and to arme my selfe with all the best aduise I can against the sinister working of any fortune. Nei∣ther will I so much preiudicate the opinion, which I desire the world (without vaine ostentation) should hold of me, & my ministers, as that my enterprises should not haue a way giuen them by the wisest & best weighed counsell, and per∣fect concurrence made betweene my fortune well iudging of my counsell, and all proper occasions. As for Mirza An∣tonio (for so he euer called mee) what he is to mee vou all must know, and my estimation of him: which I assre my selfe to be grounded vpon a good and true iudgement, since he hath beene the first and onely propounder of the mani∣fest point of all other, which doth or may concerne mee most. So for that matter of sending in which there is more diuersitie of opinions about the forme of circumstance, then essentiall matter of substance, I will remit it to his fi∣delitie and true affection to me, to dispose as hee shall in those two great works in a noble minde, finde meetest for my honour, and conuenient, & certainest for the effecting. Yet this must I tell you and him, which hath not yet beene thought of, That a great Prince, as I am, must receiue a de∣niall for an iniury: and I had rather not know them at all, then with knowing them to be also offended by them;
though (this I say also) that he cannot be iudged to haue authoritie to command their wils, therfore must be blame∣lesse in all, except in the lightnesse of his imagination, vpon which slender occasion he ought not, for the credite of his own iudgement, to haue formed a Counsell. Before I could frame one word of reply, he rose, and hauing talked a little while alone with Xathmascolibeague, he called my interpreter, and held him some quarter of an houre in a very earnest speech: which was, to command him (as he afterwards told me) not to let me know what his Viseire had said against me, but charged him to animate me to loue his people, and also to confirme (in all he could) my affection & well-hearted in∣tention to his own seruice.The Persian Vcrs com¦plement with Sir Anthony Sey. After he was retired, the Viseire came vnto me, and hauing saluted me with a goodly fa∣shion of courtesie, he began to desire me not to be offended, that his being curious of his Maiesties good, had stirred in him so violent a desire, that through it he had mistaken me, and the true aspect of my ends. But as there was euer a good remedie for all knowne errors, and especially for the most accelerated, so there should be in his towards me all the best and carefull seruice, which he might possibly doe vnto me. And though I stood in need of little helpe to put for∣ward the kings affection towardes me, yet hee assured me, that in all due and fit opportunities he would not be wanting to performe the vttermost part of a true friend, in that o any thing else which might protend my good. I did make all the shew I could to beleeue him; commended his zeale to his king; and withall desired him to haue a con∣stant opinion, that my good intention to his seruice also might mislad my iudgement of some things, but the truth of my heart neuer. Therefore I desired him, that if I did erre also in such a point, it would please him to correct me as a father, and not to oppose against the rising of my fortune as an enemie, since I knew my hopes to be of small time or
expectation if they must wrestle with his power and wise∣dome: also that I knew his vertue too great to enuie a man which could not grow at all, but vnder him, and that I knew a good desert of my selfe towardes him in the conscience of my most affectionate respectiue disposi∣tion, which would neuer faile to make very perfect de∣monstrations of it selfe vnto him, in all worthy occasions which should eyther offer themselues, or he should com∣mand. And so were parted with a mutuall shew of great satisfaction, which I know now of vs both had. That night Couchi Bassa arriued at the Court; and next day as the king told me, accompanied with the Viseir & Ba∣stan. Aga perswaded him again, not against making him rea∣die for the war against the Turke, if he should be counselled vnto it by any good aduantage, or forced by the Christians peace with him: but (because his Maiestie was almost de∣termined that way) to vse all the best meanes, first to wea∣ken him without shewing himselfe purposely an actor in it. (And that was to be done by encouraging his rebels, and by breaking as much as he could the trade and commerce in∣to his dominions, which subministred vnto him both the sinewes of his warre, and those also which did bind the bo∣die of his state together.) That Mombarecke (which held of his Maiestie the principalitie of Sustane; of the Turke Gi∣ziwr, and the deserts from Balsaracke to Damasco with the lest conuenence of his Maiestie, would continue his Armes against the Turke, and make all those passages so infestuous, that neyther Bagdet nor Damasco should receiue the com∣moditie, of any of those Carauans of Merchants which vsually came to them from Basarah: by which the Turke should loose euery yeare two millions of Entrata. For the Portugeses (if his Maiestie would please to iudge indifferently) it was as likely that they would mislike his too great increase as the Turke, and so much the more as
they were lesse able to resist him, then the Turke was; Larr and Nicolow ioyned together: whereof by taking the one, he did more assure any mouing of theirs against him; and if they ment him well they could not bee offended at the neerenesse of his neighbourhood. And ingaging the other in some actions against the Turke as to robbe, spoyle, and hinder the trafficke of the Arabian gulfe, and such like should by such an act make him desperate of the Turke; and so ioyne him through his owne necessitie surely to him: and though he were otherwise of no great importance, yet by his bordering vpon the sea, & his mens expertnes of the sea, he was to be made in that point very profitable hereafter, and a good instrument for the present (and euery small addi∣tion of force, or meanes gathereth reputation to all great actions) when the time were fit that they should appeare partials to to his Maiestie. And for sending an Ambassador to the Princes Christian, he thought it first against his dignitie to offer himself vnto them, who in their need of him through their pride neglected once to speake vnto, or with his Ma∣iestie. Then in the wel carrying of his other purposes, which would be palesated by so maine a cause of suspition. There∣fore that his Maiestie must eyther determine to breake pre∣sently with the Turk, not which he could; or else to giue him no apparant suspition of any such inclination or carriage of things: by which he should winne time to make his owne prouisions with good foundation, and keepe the Turke vn∣furnished; euer, nourishing him with so wise artifice, that he might be secured from any opinion of such mouing the time nor nothing else promising felicity to his actions so much as the wise vsing of the time, and of those things which, were offered him. What the king replied I know not (hauing receiued this opinion of Courtchi Bassa from the king himselfe, who by that and other eternall contrary counsels was so much di∣stracted
in his owne resolution as a prince that desireth to doe great things, and them also well determines not so∣dainly vpon faire hopes, but carrieth his hopes to per∣fection by the working of his wisedome: so that many daies after, when I would begin to enter into a new dis∣course of those deliberations, hee would presently turne himselfe to speake of other matters. In this fashion more then one moneth passed, in which I had no comfort of my desire, but onely that which Xa-Thamas Colibeague & Oliuer Di Chan gaue me, and the kings exceeding fauour which rather increased then decreased towards me. In this time (as though all the strength of that ill spirit, who euer raiseth the vttermost of his skill and power to preuent all good purposes had conspired to ouerthrow the well proceeding of this good businesse) There came newes to the Court, that Mahomet-Aga Generall of the Ianizaries of Bagdat was entred into the kings Confines, as Ambas∣sador from the Turke, with a rich present, and maruellous honourable traine: And that those of Ormus had stayed by force sixteene slaues which were sent by the great Mogore to the king; with nine other which Oliuer Di-Chan had bought in those parts, and the Marchants for their more security had sent them with those of the kings. This raised the courages of those which opposed themselues to the maine businesse, alienated mightily the hearts of Oliuer Di-Chan, and Xa-Tamas Colibeague from all, and exasperated the king himselfe so much against them, that his ordi∣narie speech was no other, but that hee would shortly learne them to haue a respect vnto him, which did so ex∣ceedingly fill my very soule with perplexitie, and anxietie, that I fell into a very dangerous sicknesse, in which the king neuer failed daily to visit me himselfe; and finding that the recordation of those things did aggrauate both the griefe of my minde, and vnquiet of my bodie, he forbad that any
in my presence should speake more of it, but onely com∣fort me with all sort of discourse of recreation, with so roy∣all and so gracious a regard, that he shewed apparantly enough, that few accidents could dispose his minde from any reasonable contentment which he might giue me. In the meane time Mahomet-Aga arriued at the Court, whom the king sent his Viseire and Courtchibassa to meete accompanied with a thousand horse of the principall of the Court, and of the Citie. These (no question) gaue him large instructions, and as large hopes; which if he had gui∣ded also rightly, he might haue done his Master great ser∣uice, and himselfe infinite honour: but through his owne too hastie greedinesse, assurance, and desire, he preuented himselfe whilest he striued first beyond that which was in∣differently good, then beyond that which was better, and at the last beyond all reasonable (and I thinke his owne) hopes. For first being proudly confident vpon the greatnes of his Master; then vpon the difficultie of the king of Persi∣ans present estate, to be moued to offend so potent a neigh∣bour; then vpon so great and strong a faction in the Court; besides hauing heard by them that the kings mind was al∣tered from those of Ormus, and that Oliuer Chan also was then likewise alienated from his first censure through the particular wrong done vnto himselfe, or else that he chan∣ged the inclination of his minde according to the corrupt condition of all Courts, in which the loue of obsequiousnesse to the Prince, and fitting themselues to their appetites (by that meanes to strengthen their owne emulations) is more power-able then the feare to do ill, and the working of their owne consciences: or else that in all things there is a certaine reuolution; and as there are mouings of times, so there are also vartations in our minds and fashions. Making himselfe strong in his assurance vpon these foundations, &c vpon the weaknes of his oppo∣sition, which was left much infeebled by the distraction of
Oliuer Di-Chan, he left the right way of mouing by de∣grees so great a businesse to carrie it euen without agita∣tion or danger: And as though with knowing the cir∣cumstances he had attained the end, he ouerthrew his Ma∣sters intention, his owne honour, and almost lost his life, if the kings infinite clemency had not eyther despsed or pit∣tied his error. Neyther doe I set downe these thinges with so par∣ticular a care for my owne sake to make eyther my worke the greater, or to make an ostentation of any thing which was not, but because in all discourses which I haue seene giuen forth for the worlds better vnderstanding of those things which one man hath compiled out of the largenes of his reading or experience, it hath beene a good and necessarie vse to set downe the nature of the people treated of, & in what sort they might be or were temperate∣ly gouerned, and how much was learned of the Princes and great mens disposition, iudgement and skill in ruling; by which course, they which obserued it, were accounted wise and prudent vnderstāders of the times & places which they conuersed in: so in this time of greater corruption where all contrarie examples not seen, nor knowne by vs, may breed a wonder, by that rarenesse of others vertues, and by that, a detestation of our owne familiar vices, which giue few amongst vs the wisedome to make a true distinction of honestie from dishonestie, & that which is iustly profitable from that which is vniustly harmefull; by which meanes may be gathered more and better profit by other mens foraine expe∣rience, then those examples in which they are daily exercised. But as such a fashion of declaration will be of the best sort of vse, so I am not ignorant with how little delight and cre∣dit, it will be accompanied. For to relate the situation of of countries, the variable euents of the acts of great Princes and Captaines, these do detaine and reuiue, as it were the
minds of the readers. I speake onely of a good intention, tossed with the tempests, first of many desperate calamities; then with many potent oppositions; the iustice, wisedome, temperance, liberalitie, valour, mercifulnesse, and generali∣ty of all excellent vertues in a Prince esteemed by vs barba∣rous, and yet indeed fit to be a patterne and mirrour to some of ours, who haue Christ in our mouthes, and not the least of his Saints in our hearts. Besides the varietie of his fortunes disposition, bridled and brought to a good incli∣nation by the force of his wisedome and goodnesse, and true experience of the power of fortune: in which dis∣course there is no alteration of matter; the subiect being euer the person of the king, and his excelling vertues: which I had rather speake of, to point out by them the happinesse of his state, then to see a farre off the miseries of some of ours swimming in blood, full of cruell commandement, continuall accusations, false frendships, the ruine of innocents, implacable factions, and pernicious ends of things: contrarie to that which ought to be with vs of a better profession; and is with those which we despise. But to returne to my purpose. Mahomet-Aga being ar∣riued at the Court: and refreshed some small time, the day of his audience was honoured with all the Princes of the kings Court, and my selfe being too weake through my long sicknesse, the king commanded that my brother should be present also; where after a magnificent oration of his Masters potencie in all conditions of force, he told the king,The proud message deli∣uered by the Turks Embas∣sador to the King of Pesi that he was sent to admonish him to remain constant in the truce with his Master; to require restitution of those Courdines which without licence had abandoned their possessions in his Masters Prouinces, and contrarie to the tearmes of amity were intertained by him. That his Master also demanded the restitution of Corassa to the former
gouernment in the alteration of which, though he knew his greatnesse and Maiestie violated, yet he could yeeld so much from what he ought to do to the king of Persias years and heat of valour; that hee would content himselfe with that satisfaction. Then he aduised him to force his nature, and couer this vaine glimmering of fortune with iudge∣ment and good counsell; which euer would aduise him to maintaine and preserue his estate, rather with warie then violent counsels. This his Master demanded of him to obli∣terate (by the facile granting of it) all greater iniuries; wi∣shed his Maiestie to consider well of the demand, the con∣dition of the demander and his owne: Denials euer to such Potentates being receiued for maine offences; that it was euer a wise determination to yeeld to the authoritie of time, and neces∣sitie, and to auoid by that good iudgement, vrgent perils, and si∣nister conditions: nothing being a more secure repaire, then to strike satle against insupportable tempests, it many times happe∣ning that the too great valour of men vsed with too great confi∣dence is itterly persecuted, and sometimes oppressed with an vn∣happie course of fortune: against the current of which, when once through error it breaketh, orth no humane force, or wit can make any resistance. And because all men for the most part are blind in discerning the iudgement of good or ill counsels, from their end, celebrating them when they prosper with a false argument from the successe: his Maiestie should giue a great example of true wisedome, not to be so much ouerborne with the present delight, or future hopes, extracted from those first prosperous successes, as not to be able to lift vp his eyes to see the clouds which he had raised by some of them: which if they were not preuented, would break forth into extreme tempests. To conclude, he said that his Maiestie must be so farre from thinking to weaken his Maister by cunning and by artifice, and so to keepe his Armes farre from him; that he must resolue such courses to be seruile: and to execute
apparantly and presently onely, princely, and like himselfe; so that eyther he must proue himselfe a friend, or declare himself an enemie. The first would merit any priuate grace, which should be no sooner deserued then attained; the o∣ther would giue glory and honour to the victor, euer deare and honest to the winner, precipitious and shamefull to the looser. And not speaking of the inuinciblenesse of his Ma∣ster, God himselfe would iudge the first vniust infringer of an amitie sworne to his great name. The King without any thing mouing from his accusto∣med grauitie, tempering the iustice of his indignation with the true magnanimitie of his minde, answered him to this effect.The King of  his an∣swer to the Turk Em∣baador. That as the greatnesse of riches and treasure were often∣times pernicious to Princes; so were abundance of men, and large∣nesse of dominions, to such as were too weake to gouerne them: therefore that extolling the magnificency of his Ma∣ster (which might breed wonder and terrour in those who were not capable of greatnesse, was no mouer of him to decline from any part of that which belonged to his owne greatnesse. He had receiued the Courdines (oppressed by the tyrannie of cruel ministers) into his protection; and as their comming to him proceeded of their owne will, so their re∣turne from him should be voluntarie, and not through his constraint. Corasan he had iustly taken from an vsurper, and would restore the lawfull Prince, who should receiue the benefit from his munificence: and not from any point of the Turks instance. But wherefore should he be bound to giue a stricter account of his actions to the Turke, then became equall Princes to aske the one of the other; as though the lawes of ruling had but one moderator, before whose tribunall they should be all presented? Tauris belon∣ged to his predecessors; so did Sicruan, so did Dierbech; and what iustice had his king to detaine them? If none other but by the potencie of his armes; the same point of iustice he
had also to preserue what he had alreadie gotten: and to vindicate also those vniustly detained from him. If he will breake the truce made betweene my father and him, and continued by my brother and me, vpon so manifest vniust causes; as the warre was neuer prosperously prouoked a∣gainst our state by his predecessors nor himselfe, but through some strange accident, errour, or our owne disu∣nion: so beleeue that it will now breake forth to his owne destruction. Yet I doe not denie but that I had rather, both to preserue what I haue, and to recouer what my ancestors haue lost, by equitie then bloud; and by the force of reason, rather then of armes: which if I cannot, I will certainly a∣mend by vertue what I haue erred in by cunctation. My power and glory is yet soundly whole, and more increased through the merit of Modestie, which was neuer yet despised by the greatest which haue beene among men: and is esteemed by God himselfe. Wresting of actes could not deceiue others; which as they were made to God; so the iudgement of their breaking or abusing would euer be in God, and his memo∣rie, care, and power. For Mahomet-Aga himselfe; though he had forfeited the priuiledges of an Embassador, by exe∣cuting vnder that title a contrarie office; if I should (said he) presently and condignly punish you, both the memory of your present fortune (into which pride and folly hath throwne you) and my glory would be darkned; and the pu∣nishment would be followed with a sodaine forgetfulnesse; but if I free you (as I will) from your punishment, though I cannot from the fault, I shall be an eternall memorie to the world of clemencie, and leaue you a great precept ey∣ther of more iudgement, or lesse imployment: vntill you can make your selfe fitter for such a one as this, to which you haue beene vnworthily elected. As I said before if he had vsed the opportunities (which he had) discreetly, he might haue done his Master a notable
seruice, and honoured himselfe much. Tor the kings great discontentment with those of Ormus, & the strong opposi∣tion of most of his counsell to any proposition against the Turke, did facilitate a way for him to haue fashioned the king to any condition of firmer tearmes with his Master, then they had hitherto stood in. And though it was not like∣ly that there could haue beene mediated a restitution of those Courdines, yet the losse of them had beene smal, being a people euer vnstable in any certaine habitation, neither hauing vnderstanding of good, nor care of ill; proper mi∣nisters onely of rapine, and to possesse vnproper places for ciuiller inhabitants: and he might easily haue procured a restraint that none other hereafter should haue done the like; if he had propounded it from his Master, disobliged him to the king of Persia, and restored the peoples minds to their first dependance, being a Nation, though otherwise of doubtfull faith, both through their owne nature, and situa∣tion of their countrie, yet more inclined to the Turke then any both by the bond of the same religion, and hatred to the Persians. The next morning the king came vnto me, and after some other discourses,The King of Persia agreeth to the perswa∣sion of Sir Anthony Sher∣ley. he told me he had well considered of my proposition, which though otherwise he had no great in∣clination vnto, both, because of the great separation by di∣stance, and difficult meanes of correspondencie, which could be made betweene the Princes Christian & himselfe, besides the small necessitie he had of them, (God hauing gi∣uen him so ample, so rich, and so warlike a dominion) and if he had, their owne disunion amongst themselues gaue him small hope of any great good effect in what he should propound vnto them: Besides the derogation from his own greatnesse to be a demander of their amitie, whose prede∣cessors had sought it of his by diuers meanes, and vpon great conditions. Yet to shew me how deare an estimation
he held of me, he was contented not to see what belonged to himselfe, but onely to regard my satisfaction: which he willed me to determine of, and assured me of the effecting of it whatsoeuer it was. And after I had giuen his Maiestie thanks which were conuenient for so high a fauour,Sir Anthony Shely cfir∣meth the King in hi purpos of sending to the Pines of Christnm. I told him that I had pro∣pounded nothing but that which the future experience, and present reason of things would proue not onely infi∣nitely auaileable, but also necessarie for his honour, profit and securitie: to which counsell I was readie and desirous to adde my owne perill, which could by no other meanes bring an answerable benefit to the greatnesse of itselfe, but onely in the true estimation which I made of the merit of his Maiesties vertue, and my infinite affection to his ser∣uice. The necessitie of his state, I knew eyther counselled him to prouide for a warre; or to make a warre: Priuate co∣gitation hauing their progresse of such a conditiō, that they may take (as themselues wll) eyther more of lesse of fortune; but those which had raised their thoughts to the sublimitie of dominion are no more in their owne power: hauing no meane to step vpon betweene the highest of all, and precipitation. For his Maie∣stie to sleepe longer, called vpon by so maine reasons which did euidently demonstrate vnto him the ineuitable danger, (if not raine) of his state, and contrariwise, the certaine ad∣dition which his maiestie might make to his glory and state, would seeme to those that did not rightly vnderstand the excellencie of his Maiesties heart, such a weakenesse in him, as is incident to those which haue not power to temper felicitie, from glutting themselues with the abundant fruites of present prosperitie; though they haue a pati∣ent forced vigour to withstand aduersitie. That the Turke was to bee vanquished, his owne Rebelles had shewed, which haue ouercome with small forces his great power
in sundrie encounters. If his Militia hath had heretofore more vigour and valour; it is now changed through pleasure, ease, and surferinges by (their Princes example) with great corruptions; which a more vertuous Prince may reduce to their soundnesse: his Maiesties wisedome should worke immediately vppon the present generall defect and errour. Neyther should hee make a propor∣tionable concurrence betweene his factes, and wisedome, if he did loose time in doubtfull deliberations, in such a case which did euidently shew him that if he might se∣curely continue in peace, yet that peace was more per∣nicious vnto him then warre: leesing so many fayre occasi∣ons of propagating his Empyre, and making his estate eternally inuincible, and to dangerous to bee attemp∣ted againe by the Turke: when there should bee so e∣quall a ballance of potencie, as would bee betweene them, but by the recouerie of his owne, if his desire and fortune, and vertue disposed no more vnto him then that which was iustly his owne, and was vniustly de∣teyned from him. For those rebellions of the Turkes they were likely rather to increase then diminish: such man∣ner of people euermore easily consenting in vnitie, in warre, then in peace to be commaunded, or yeeld obedi∣ence: And the greatest powers which are, haue beene, or may bee, which vnited beare all before them, the violence of their strength, once diuided eyther by time, by pt, or by diuersitie of fortune, (which cannot bee at all times, and in all places alike) may bee and are subuerted. The warre it selfe will open and disclose many hidden and swelling wounds, which are now onely couered by ignorance, and others detracting of their determination. And though it be true that the Princes Christian be farre deuided; and some of them incombred with particular de∣signes amongst themselues, through the passions of their
priuate interests; yet the Emperour (who is the greatest in title, and by his alliance of the most power) is already inga∣ged against the Turke: which warre hee will more or lesse prosecute according as hee shall haue more or lesse hopes. And what greater (almost assurance of prosperous successe can be haue then the coniunction with your Ma∣iestie, whose power and vertues hee shall know? And the mouing of both your ends being the same can loose no pro∣pertie in their working, by the large separation or distin∣ction of places. The Pope also (who carrieth a Supreme authoritie among Princes to mooue them to those thinges which shall best preserue, or augment the limits of his Church) animated by your Maiesties great name and offer; will assuredly vse the vttermost of the strength, of his au∣thoritie, and industrie, to reconcile all particular enmities, and to combine all hearts to that Generall warre, in which euerie particular is truly much interessed; if they consider their conscience to their profession, and the danger where∣with they all haue beene threatned, by that great Enemies potencie: diuers Princes hauing alreadie by it suffered the vttermost of ruine. Neither shall your Maiestie despaire, but that all may be perswaded to so honourable and pious an action being a pro∣pertie in mans nature to follow, that which hath beene contrarie to their disposition to begin: And if they all should not; yet the Emperour, Pope, and King of Spaine absolutely will em∣brace the amitie, honour the name of your Maiestie, and v∣nite themselues in any termes of Princely alliance: and your Maiestie shall haue an eternall glorie amongst all; for inviting them all to so Noble, Generous and Royall an a∣ction: and at the least, draw great intercourse of Merchants of all those parts; which will giue an entrance to a kinde of sociablenesse, and that will proceed to a common respect, and so to a mutuall friendship which will giue the communication
and knowledge of many things hidden (both in the knowledge, vse and profit of them) for want of such an intercourse. Your Maiestie also wisely desireth to take away all reputa∣tion from the Turkish Religion, through your Dominions, both by scandalizing it publikly, & punishing it in particular persons: Sithence Heresie in all Religion causeth Diuiion, & the corrupted part becommeth a pernicious enemie to the Prince who supporteth the contrarie; From it arise as from a maine turbulent Spring, Treasons, Conspiracies, secret Conventicles, and Setions. Besides the greatest and largest way, which the Turke hath into your Dominions, is the faction of his Sect; as Is∣mael your Predecessor had, of that which your Majestie pro∣fesseth, to deuide your state from him: He is an absolute and Tyrannous enemie to the Christians; Your Maiesties Re∣ligion, hath a charitable opinion of them: and if drinking of Wine, burning of their Prophets Images, and such lesse apparances be in your Maiesties opinion effectuall things to estrange the peoples heartes from that Religion, by a con∣trarie vse, with those opprobries, to the other; a greater meanes your Maiestie may worke by: in giuing libertie of Christian Religiō, so much abhorred of their part, and secu∣ritie of trade, goods and person to Christians, by which you shall bind their Princes, expresse the charitie of your Law, serue your selfe in diuers thinges of them which haue been hidden vnto you, both for your vtilitie, strength and plea∣sure: and more invre your people to despise the other Re∣ligion, by so contrarie, so apparant and so great effect. Nei∣ther can they euer bee dangerous to your Maiestie, their increase being alwayes to be limited by your will. This al∣so will giue your Maiestie great fame, since by their meanes you shall recouer auaileable instruments both to preserue and augment your estate by: as Founders of Ordinance, Makers of all sortes of Armes, and Munition. So that though it may seeme a strange act in your Maiestie to bee
contented to inlarge to Christian, so new and so great a fa¦uur, yet since all great examples euer haue in them some thing o an extraordinarie qualitie, those are to bee made vse of that re∣paire by publique profit, those particular disguls which priuate men may recee of them: I know that it is for the most part a flcious ambition which imbraceth greedily new and dangerous thinges; but to determine and execute fit and conuenient thinges, is the proper effect of wisedome and courage. Your Maiestie knoweth your present estate, remembreth the courses of the times past; and the excellencie of your iudgment weigh∣eth, that which may succeede hereafter. No man receiueth harme but from himselfe; nor your Majestie can suffer none but from that which your selfe wil determine of your selfe: you are inuited to no act depending vpon fortune, but such a one as shal haue his fundation vpon Councel, reason, and iudgment. My satisfaction shall be aboue all other greatest if your Maiestie resolue of that which will bee most secure, honourable and commodious for your person, state, and particular Subjects. Well said the King you would then haue me to write to as many of the Christian Princes as are greatest amongst them, King of  Re∣on to em∣y Sir A∣ny Sly as Embassa∣r. who if they will apply themselues to our purpose may draw all other lesser vnto it, by the example of their authoritie; or at the least (if they will not consent in that point) wil command their Marchants to repaire to our Do∣minions: so that we and they may haue some good friendly vse the one of the other. The letters you shall appoint to be written to as many and to whom, you will; with priui∣ledge for Marchants, and the secure profession of their Re∣ligion and peaceable possession of their goods, and persons, in as ample sort as your selfe will deuise; and not onely for them but for al Christians whatsoeuer, which for curiositie to see, or loue to me, wil take pains to come hither; or for a∣ny purpose so euer: being impossible their purpose can at a∣nie
time bee ill towards vs, which wish them in all things so well. And because you haue been the Mouer and Perswa∣der of this businesse, you also shalbe the Actor of it, assuring my selfe that my Honour cannot be more securely reposed many mans hands, then your own: both in that I iudge of your owne disposition; and more, in that which I know of your obligation to me; besides, There is none so proper an Executor of any enterprise,Sr A   the n . as hee which is the first deuiser of it: I humbly thanked his Maiestie for his confidence; and excu∣sed my inhabilitie to performe so great a charge; Many men being more fitte to propound then to execute: That requiring a particular valour and experience, which I had not. Notwithstan∣ding, since I would not giue his Maiestie cause to suspect, that I had intimated such a thing vnto him, as either was so dangerous to carry, or impossible to effect, that I durst not for those causes vndertake it: I would onely beseech of his Maiestie one of his Princes, either to be my superior or e∣quall in the Ambassage, or such a one as might be asolute∣ly my inferior, for a testimony, onely of my assured com∣ming from his Maiestie. The first I did require because e∣quall authority where there is the selfe same power, is commonly pernitions to all actions, being impossible to fit two minds of so  a temper, that they should not haue some motions of disseng. Yet if I must be ioyned, through the gratious fauour . Maiesty (who had no more end of his honouring me, thn my affection had in seruing him:) I desired it might  a noble man, whose mind being made to greatnes could not feele the ill working of a sudden alteration. The last I requi∣red, not, that such a one could hold any condition in the former reason, but as an Armor against enuie and malice: beeing a thing incident, and almost certaine in all mens natures to behold with sore eyes the new growne felicitie of others, and to ex∣act a sharpe account of their fortunes, especially in home they haue seene, either inferiour, or in equalitie with themselues. All which
hee promised: commended my reason and prouidence in that point; and offering also presents of great valew, and worth to accompanie his Letters, which should be goodly Carpets, Swords and Daggers couered with Gold, and Ie∣wels, Plumes according to their Countrey fashion, and o∣ther things worthy to be esteemed, both for the price and rarenesse. Then he told me I must recouer my selfe, streng∣then my minde and come abroad, that hee might feast mee before my departure. And though it is likely that the dis∣position of the World (euermore inclined to detraction, then to a generous beholding of mens actions) will in the iniquitie of that nature, hardly beleeue the magnificent fa∣shion of that King held towards me then in all points, and confirmed by his infinite Royall fauour, continued and in∣creased to my brother now: Yet the act he did, doth plaine∣ly demonstrate, part of the one, and amongst Honourable minds, I shall be beleeued for the rest. And though that vi∣per of malice which I so much feared, did bite me in a maine member of my Honour, and infeebled it so much, that it remained lame from being able to passe forward in that pase of reputation, which so great a labour, so many dan∣gers, so great an enterprise, and so pious an action merited; yet it is impossible that malice it selfe, much lesse the infusi∣on of it in wicked spirits can take from me, the true know∣ledge to this time, and memorie to posteritie, that I was a zealous author of so Christianlike a purpose: They much mistaking my mind, which iudged it rather capable and de∣sirous of apparant then the true substance of things; though it be true that euerie man will contend for both, when both are his right. For thirty dayes continuallie, the King made that feast in a great garden of more then two miles compasse,he Persian agnifience their so∣mne feasts. vnder tents pitched by certain small courses of running water, like diuers riuers, where euerie man that would come, was pla∣ced
according to his degree, either vnder one or other Tent, prouided for abundantly with meate, fruite, & wine, drinking as they would, some largelie, some mo∣deratelie without compulsion. A roialty and splndor which I haue not seene, nor shall not see againe but by the same King: Our Princes abhorring such vaine expences, desiring rather to haue the power of domi∣nion, then to make those sorts of ostentation; but such is and hath beene anciently the custome of that Coun∣try (as the holy Booke of God sheweth vs.) And if with so great authority, itwere needfull, or comely to pro∣duce other histories, there are diuers which speake also of many magnificences of those Kings, and of that amongst the rest: & therfore it is euer to be praised for the constant antiquite, if not for the reason of the ex∣pence. The ioy of the feast was much augmented by two great fortunes,Two great for∣tunes which befell the king during his feast. 1. The submission of the Tar∣tars to his Crowne. which gaue themselues at that time to the King; which were these: The Tartars of Bucke∣hawrd, (which haue euer beene of greatest reputation amongst all those of the Orient, both for their valour in armes and wealth) moued vnto it through their owne diuisions; the Captaines of which being of vali∣dity and proper industrie, to enflame the ciuill dissen∣tions, and vnfit to temper their alternate good succes∣ses, (It being the condition of troubles and disorders to giue most power and authority to those of the worst sort, and most mischieuous spirits: whereas to appease them requireth great art, and reposed spirits,) wearied with the vexation of their owne troubles in such a state of things, as produ∣ced nothing but disorders amongst the factious, a de∣sperate rage amongst the vanquished, and no authority amongst the victors: neither the vigour of the lawes
standing, none almost of the Princes liuing: when all these extremities could not bring them to consent to the erecting of their owne estate, as it first was of an ab∣solut principality, yet by the fame of the king of Persiaes iustice in gouernment, & the felicity which followed all his enterprises, they were brought to consent vnite∣ly in one to send, and deliuer themselues, and their Country vnder his subiection.2. The rich pre∣sent with the allne of the great Mogr offed to the Ps. And the great Mo∣ghor King of Labor moued by the like fame, sent a great Ambassador to desire a marriage between his el∣dest sonnes daughter, and Cephir Micza, a eldest▪ sonne to the King of Persia, with a mighty present, and as mighty offers both of ready money, & to pay 30000. men in any warre, which the King of Persia should vn∣dertake for seuen yeeres. Such a quality hath prosperity, when it beholdeth a man, or State, with affectionate eyes to intrue it selfe vpon him or it, though themselues would not: an somtimes in things which the wisdom of men holdeth im∣possible to be intimated, and nfeasible to be executed, which maketh wise men often rather to desire them, then to hope for them. In this time came vnto me a Portingal Frier, named Alphonso Cordero,The comming of two Friers to insinuate with Sir Antho∣n, Sherly. of the order of the Franciscans Secular, and an other Armenian Frier of Ierusalem, with a mes∣sage from an other Frier of better estimation, called Nichola Di-Meto: the effect of which was this, that hee had beene Inquisitor generall of the Indies, and his time being finished, as also, hauing receiued commandement from the Pope and King of Spain to return, & for som other important causes to the christianity of these parts not being willing to attend the tedious voyage of the Porting all Fleet by sea, chose rather the hassard to goe
ouer Land: to which he was the more animated hauing heard of the fauour and estimation which certaine Chri∣stians held in that Court, which hee did not doubt would Christian-like honour him, being so great an in∣strument of the Church, and of so great a Potentate as the King of Spaine. For though wee were English and hee Portugese, and by the priuate interresses of our Princes, their names were made enemies in the ordinary sort of our Nation, Yet Religious men were euer priuiledged, from common ma∣lice; and that place which was opposite of it selfe to the profession of Christ, would be a perswading argument enough, for any Noble or Pious mind, to honour, in all persons our oppressed faith, without regarding the title or Countrie of the profession thereof. But when hee came, though this insinuation of his were like a good meane; and shewed to proceed from the best condition of spirits; Yet hee did so much degenerate from the name of a Christian, much more of a Religious man, of a true Subject to his Prince, and of a Pious wisher to those thinges which tended to the generall good of the whole Common-wealth of Christendome, that he forgat not only the honour which I had freely, and with a good heart done him (waking againe the names of those enmities which he desired to haue sup∣pressed) at the first secretly, at the last openly, setting forth many pretences against mee: which if it had proceeded from the ordinarie imperfections of naue, (which runneth more headingly to the reuenge of iniuries euen in opinion, then to the recordtion of essentill and ciuid benefus: gracious acts being a burden, reuenge eseemed a game to vs) though the cause of it had proceeded from that
imperfection had beene ill; yet being naturall it, had beene somewhat tollerable: and if he had not also added to that fault another inexcusable one, not onely to neglect, but euen to des∣pise all those other greater duties: which if they bound him not in affection; yet they must haue bound in awfulnesse and feare an Ctre, which had not beene vtterly giuen ouer to the worst temptations of the wicked spirit, and enemie to Mankin and substantiall subuertor of all godly purposes. For I (though otherwise vnobliged) willing in the beginning of the foundation which the King permit∣ted me to lay, of God his true knowledge in those parts, to shew all deuout respects to God and to all his Mini∣sters and knowing that the name of diuision amongst our selues, would but scandalize all) vsed him with all those duties and reuerences which I could possibly de∣uise, or any ambtious heart could desire: which gaue (as it fell out) but a freer passage to the iniquitie of his soule; to my great grife, preiudice of the estimation in those parts of Religious men, and to the most infinite affliction of the other Franciscan, that can be expressed; he being certainely a good man, and as farre as his vn∣derstanding guided him zealous to perswade others to be so, helping to expres by a sincere and holy exam∣ple ofie what he wanted in discourse. But vbi Dei nu∣men praetenditur secleribus, subit animum timor, ne fraudibus humanis vindcandis, diuni iuris aliquid inamixtum viole∣mus. For which reason I will say only this: that to free my selfe from the vnexpected crosses which daily rose against my businesse, I pressed the King as hotly (as ciuilly I could) for my dispatch: which hee granted me at the thirtie daies end: hauing appointed Assan, Chan a gallant young Prince to goe with mee: so com∣plete
in all worthie graces that if God had pleased, that he had proceeded in the busines, he had brought great Honor to the King, reputation to his Countrie, & had established the affaires to the vniuersall good of the World. But the beginnings of all great things being deriued from God, so their ends are either perfected or disanuled by his determination. For though nature hath giuen vs as men great and excellent faculties, yet GOD will haue vs know, and acknowledge him to be GOD: and that nothing is properly our own, or gotten by our owne power but giuen vs onely through his munificencie. And therefore peraduenture,The enter∣prise of ur Ati Sl oerto vne by his owne Instment. GOD would not so much satisfie the pride which the very loue of affecting so great and glo∣rious a businesse had swolne me in: but made mee my selfe find an instrument to ouerthrow my labours ad wrestle against my proceedings (which durst not almost stand in my presence) and forced me to ake him of the King, and to bee the Authour of my owne hrme. So strangely doth God correct the errours and sinnes of our hu∣manities, and taketh from the strong imagination: which stirre in vs (through the innated iniquitie of our hearts.) the thoughts of any other causes of those inflictions, then that true working of his verie iudgements: by which wee may see if we will not be obstinate against ourselues, that the full vse of those things which wee possesse, the very light which wee enioy, the spaces of the Earth which our feet tread ouer, what∣soeuer we can doe, say, or thinke, is raised, distributed and guided, by God his counsell, will and prouidence. For when it was concluded that Assan Chan should go, and his pro∣uisions were all ready, my cōmission and parent (for the principall points of my businesse) sealed; the King mar∣ried him to an Aunt of his much against his Princes wil
and more to my griefe; none other of the great ones hauing a spirit to apprehend only such a voyage, much lesse a heart to performe it. So that being instantly sued to by Cuchin-Allibi a Courtchie of sixe Thomans stipend by the yeare, and in disgrace also, for some ill part that he had plaied, I (pres∣sed thereunto by the Viseir and Bastan Aga) spake vnto the king that he might goe with me, in the forme onely of a testimonie, though honoured with some good words in the letters, for the bettter reputation of the businesse: which the King was exceeding backward in consenting vnto, desiring me eyther to goe alone, or better accompanied. The last I told him lay in his Ma∣iesties power to command; the other I could not doe, and promise him, or hope my selfe for good successe: nothing being more fraile then such a reputation (as would suddenly grow by such a businesse) vnsuppor∣ted by any sort of strength, so that it would be an ob∣iect for all sort of malice to worke vppon, his Maiestie being too farre remoued to giue iust proofe of my im∣ployment from him, if it should be opposed. And the more strange it was, and lesse hoped for, as it would be the more ioyfully embraced by the good. So it would giue the more colour▪ and strength to bad mindes against me. At the last (I think through the secret wor∣king of those which were euer enemies to the procee∣ding of this businesse, & the mainescarcitie of others which had minds fit for such imployment, & qualities also fit for such minds.) I was vrged to take that fellow, & the king content to let him go. But would bestow on him no more then 50. Tomans for the whole expense: which he called also cast away. Him I left to bring the
appointed present after me; and the letters to the par∣ticular Princes; which were then readie at my depar∣ture not sealed, and the present not throughly pro∣uided: my selfe desiring to free my selfe from the Court, where euery occasion was receiued by those which were contrarie to the enterprise to hinder it. After I had taken my leaue of the king, the morning before my departure he came to finde me againe at my house:The cause for whi the Kng of sa detaned Sir Robert Srley. and after a little other speech he said vnto me, that my absence from him would exceedingly griue him, his affection to me being true, and his hopes of me many. If he had beene furnished of any sit to haue vndergone the mannagement of this affaire, he would neuer haue enioyned me to so much trauaile, and so many perils, but that I knew his Court to be ignorant of the language and properties of ur parts, and since he was prouoked by me to send thiher, he knew that I would be contented with my labour to keepe him, and his from all sorts of scorne. That my brother was young, and therefore the more to be tendered, and not euery day to be exposed to new labours: his loue to vs both made him carefull in that point, but more par∣ticularly his infinite desire of my returne; which hee thought would be more assured by so deare a pawne: And by daily relation which I should receiue of his royall vsage, I should also be daily inuited to returne howsoeuer. If I met with such fortunes as would be worthy to make me stay from him; or such accidents as had power to hinder me by their necessitie; the com∣pany of my brother should giue him great satisfaction in my absence. And if the worst should happen vnto me, he did desire euer to haue a subiect so neare vnto
me, vpon whom he might make a declaration vnto the world, both of what qualitie his owne minde was; and of what condition his true and royall affection to∣wards me was. Before I could answere this infinite fauourable and and gracious speech of his: my Brother (whose mind, euer disposed him to the best things) hauing by his owne nature, and excellent spirit (which in his younger yeares he bettered with higher studies, not as many who vnder a magnificent title, loue slouthfull idlenesse, but v∣sing them in their true propertie) to confirme our ordinarie weaknesse against the tempests of fortune,The abse wih the tue and roper ve o studies. and to learne by the goodly precepts of wise men, that which the frailtie of mans constitution blindeth from our sight: and to esteeme onely good that which is honest, and euill those things which do participate with viciousnesse. And though hee might arogate as mch to the Nobiitie of his bloud, as the best borne Gentleman may,Sr Anton, Sher∣leys comn∣dation of his brothe Sir Ro∣bert Serley. yet (euer making estima∣tion of that, and other such qualified ornaments as were without the minde, neither to be accouned a∣mongst the speciall good or ill things which a man should truly behold in himselfe) he hath and doth con∣tend more with himself to be worthie of the best titles, then to be esteemed by those he hath, contemning e∣qually riches and superfluitie, and pouertie which groweth by a mans owne vice: being stedfast and iust in good things, and constant against all feare: and if he bee guided by the height of his minde to striue with more feruour then warinesse, for glo∣rie and reputation, the best iudging sort of the world know that the couetousnes of that point of eter∣nitie is the last appetite which the wisest men dispoile
themselues of. Neyther am I induced to celebrate so much the memorie of so many vertues as I know in him, because he is my brother: but absolutely am led vnto it without fauour or ambition, by the perswasion onely of a good conscience, for the sole merite and re∣ward of the same. That minde I say of his euer coun∣selled by such thoughts, apprehending that his staying with the king, might be of wonderfull effect, to keepe his minde constant in the resolution which hee had ta∣ken: and gessing at many occasions which might hap∣pen in my absence, the well vsing of which might con∣firme him more: some also if they were not tempered might coole his resolutions (which he knew to be taken rather to satisfie me, and with an intent to see the suc∣cesse of the proceeding of things, then a more constant determination) answered the king,Sir Robert Serleys an∣swere to the King of Persia. presently thus. That our two soules were so vnitely conioyned, that our willes were diuided in nothing, our affections to his Maiestie, and our desires to serue him were the same, and such as they could not be separated from his com∣mandements. And though the promise of fauours from him which could command, did bring euer with it the force of necessitie, yet we both were so cleare in the iudgemēt of the royall disposition of his Maiestie that he would neither absolutely will, nor seeme to desire of vs any thing but that which should bee honourable for his authoritie, and conuenient for our obedience to bee done by vs. The parting of both our bodies from his presence was nothing, in respect of our best parts which euer should attend his Maiestie with vowes, and pro∣fers, and wishes which were worthy to proceede from his true seruants and friends. And as worthy of his
infinite vertues. But because hee did desire to haue one of vs which was himself to remaine with him, he would doe it, and giue his Maiestie so much greater occasion to loue vs both by that effect of vertue which he should proue in him, tempering the necessitie of his passion, for his Maiesties satisfaction, & better purposes which time & such occasions as must needs be brought forth, should shew his Maiestie. Neyther did he incline at all to doe this for any feeling which he would haue in that point of his Maiesties munificences promised, but onely for the sensiblenesse of doing well which hee thought and knew he should do by obeying his Ma∣iestie in that commaunding request. Hee did confesse notwithstanding that the world could not lay vpon him a greater aduersitie, then to be separated from me: yet he would neuer bee so broken with any fortune, (though it should rise from other causes) as to loose the least title of the dignitie of his minde. His yeares were but few, but neyther gray heires nor wrinckles should (with so wise an vnderstanding iudgement as his Maiesties) giue more authoritie to any then the good fruites proceeding from an honest and vertuous spending of the time which a man hath passed: hee did desire no more fauour with his Maiestie for his staying then his other merits should bee worthie of: yet because hee was left alone without other com∣fort then what his owne heart gaue him, hee would bee confident that his Maiestie would not forget what hee owed to himselfe as a Prince, nor to him as a Gentleman which had freely matched obedi∣ence with affection. What my brother shall ef∣fect with the Princes Christian, as it is a thing vncer∣taine;
so he nor I will promise any thing: but I know he will industriate himselfe to his vttermost for your Maiesties honour and seruice, and I will hope well of the end of his labours. In the meane time I beseech God, since the Turkes loue cannot apply it selfe by no meanes to your Maiestie, that their hatreds may con∣tinue one against the other: no destiny being able to vrge faster forward the greatnesse of your Dominion, nor no fortune being of more validity to make an euen way vnto it, then the amity of our Princes, and eternall discord amongst your enemies. I was almost saying, that God would prosper your Maiestie in all things; but certainely I trust hee will: and I say so, since it be∣longeth more rightly to his great Holinesse, and to our reuerence to belieue constantly of his deeds then to know them. And this great reason I haue of my con∣fidence, the greatnesse which God hath giuen your Maiesty ioined to so great and excellent vertues▪ which questionles are appointed to some great & extrordina∣ry end. Then that your Maiestie hath pleased not to deceiue your selfe in this withering peace which you haue with the Turke, which is more delighting for the present, then safe for the future: that rest being euer false, which is taken amongst inopulent and strong neighbours. The Ambassador hauing shewed by his arrogancie in speaking, that when there shall bee giuen a fit opor∣tunity for doing, modesty and honesty will bee onely names of times past. And your iust and good procee∣ding in an aduersity of fortune, will be esteemed such a weakenes as is farre from you and their good successe, will be attributed to their valour and wisdom. And thogh your Maiestie in the sublime excellency of your
royall mind doe euer number fortune amongst doubt∣full things, and vertue amongst the certaine: yet true wisdome of the world will alwayes care to strengthen the one with the other, by so proper a concurrēce, that your vertue shall euer haue the attendance of fortune, to fill your Maiesty with good and glorious acts, and the world with good and famous wordes, and re∣lations. These words of his were gratiously & tenderly recei∣ued of the king, & after some teares on al parts, the king and himselfe hauing brought me some sixe miles, wee all parted they for the Court, my selfe for my iourney, hauing first left with my brother, my heart certaine∣ly, not onely for the coniunction which nature had made between vs, but also for those worthy sparkes, which I found in him likely to be brought to great perfecti∣on by his vertue, which cannot leaue working in any, which will giue them way, much more in him, who will make way for them. And besides diuers instructions (which though hee ted not) yet the cōmon duty of those which are bound in so neer respects as we are,Sir Anthonie Sheley instru∣ctions and ad∣uice to his bro∣ther Sir Robert Sheley, when he left him in Persia. required not deeds of wāt, but abundance all benefites looing much of their splendor, both in the giuer and receiuer, that doe beare with them an exprobratiue terme of necessitie:) first, I desired him to remember, that his fortune & safety in that place sub∣sisted only vpon the kings fauour, which in vertuous prin∣ces was euer to bee maintained by vertue: That Princes ares and eyes were in euery place, Courts being full of spies, and nothing hidden from emulation; which by how much more it would bee carried couertly; so much more would it be dangerous, against which hee could pre∣uaile
of nothing better then his owne innocency, and patience, the one of which would preserue him from all fault; the other from perill; the wisdome of men o∣uercomming more by working of time, thē by violent passions which doe neuer remoue the ill, but onely open secrete imper∣fections, which giue power to our enemies to worke vp∣on, and the more courage by preuailing themselues vpon er∣rour and weaknesse. But because for what belonged to the good gouernment of himselfe, I knew that hee could haue no better precepts then those which his own mind would giue him, I wold only desire him that neither absence, nor opiniōs, which might rise throgh the tediousnes of long absēce, nor ill instruments might preuaile so fare with him as to make any breach in his affection towardes mee: our perfect vnion tending to both our preseruations, and reciprocal increase of both our fortunes.The bond of Nature and oud. Time, Fortune, or sometimes ambition, & other errors might diminish, change, and dissolue priuate friendships; but our own bloud was euer vnalterably the same & though in the freenes of our natures, others vsually parti∣cipite of our prosperities: yet none so fully as those which are bound by so deare titles of nature, and our aduersities no man would euer feele but our selues, neither could the Kings affe∣ction increase, or be constant to any of vs both, if it were not indeared by our owne example. The cause of his staying with the King, though his commandement and desire bare the colour of it; yet essentially and truly it was to aduance the great worke, of which God had laid the foundation & had chosen vs, for true instruments, not mouing it by Emperours, Kings or Princes, but by so humble Agents, questionlesse for the greater retribu∣tion of his glory: for which wee must care as his ser∣uants
and creatures in all things: but most in this as particularly directed by him to it. And though it was likely that God his infinite wisdom would not faile to subminister eternally to his vnderstanding, proper and conuenient meanes of proceeding for the perfection of his owne worke: yet we should find, that some great part of those meanes are insensibly infused into our reasons, the instruction of which in good things we must euer follow as his, and though that we speake, and speake alwaies as men, notwithstanding when it pleased God to prosper the effect of our conceptions: questionlesse, there is a greater power pre∣dominant then mans. What, we haue diuers times pro∣iected secretly together, God you see hath perfected, and therefore wee may boldly say, more intending to that end, vpon the same confidence and assurance: Wherefore, when you shall either by the Kings owne motiō or others importunde occasions fal in discourse with him vpon any point of these affaires: you must know,Negotiation with Princes. that as all Princes ought to lay the foundation of all their enterprises vpon these three maine rockes, the Iustice of the cause, Facility of the enterprise, and fruit of the victory: so in negotiations with them you must neuer be so confident vpon those points, especially, the best of equity and iustice, as vpon the true experience & knowledge of the Princes dispo∣sition, who either iealous to hazard or ambitious to get, at∣tendeth ordinarily to interest and profit, and not to what he ought to doe, neither in the vprightnesse of this honor, or faith giuen, or obligation of precedent fauour or benefite: Therefore since being too secure doth but giue way, to dan∣ger and the knowledge of the worst is the best meanes to pre∣uent all that may be ill, let not your desires of promouing this great and good businesse, blind you from foresee∣ing
all sorts of preoccupations, which we both haue ta∣ed of, and you alone may perchance find greater, but not beholding too fixed and stedfastly what the King in equitie, and the truth of the cause should doe: pene∣trate into the soule of the actiō, the stability, or mutable∣nesse of his nature: his ordinarie or forced inclinations. Finally into his present humours or uture likely pretences, and then present him with those reasons which your best iudgement, shall haue prouided for him in fit time and with a wel vnderstanding dexteritie. The factiōs of the Court you must make your selfe learned in and beare your selfe wisely and vprightly betweene both;Factions of the Court. you hauing no strēgth to adde power to any of both: but any of those hauing power to subuert you; so that by shewing to vnderstād those that are against you, you shall but make them your more apparant enemies and by depending absolutely vpō the other procure no assured strength to our selfe, but a demonstration without effect, & whensoeuer they shal ioyn together for their owne interesses (which often happeneth betweene factions in Courts) you shalbe left a pray to those which hate you; whose reuenge shalbe certaine, the others faith nothing. The cor∣ruptions of all Courts giuing a licence to great men to serue their turnes vpon lesser, in all thinges and more then for that to regard them in nothing. Besides the ordinarie dispositions of such is to winke at our priuate friends mischiefe, and as you must not declare your selfe soly for the one, nor wholy a∣gainst the other; so you must not couertly beare them both in hand that you are theirs: such artifice being of the poorest and weakest condition, nothing being able to be hid from the spying eyes in Court, and such an illusion once perceiued, is so farre without remedie as euery man will hate you and no man trust you. You must then beare your selfe equally to all, kee∣ping
all friends and making no enemies depending vpon no man,Factions. but your owne vertue and worthinesse, and his affecti∣on, which in the perfection of his owne royall minde, is onely to be preserued by honest wayes. In cases of your businesse you shall need vse no such diligence as frame, partialities, factions being alreadie made and animated and armed, watching with the ve∣rie strength of their desires to aduance their Honours by the good or ill successe of it. Rumors.You must bee constant against rumors, and beware to bee noted a willing bearer of such reports as may either touch any in Honour or otherwise to be taken for an offence, and may giue your selfe cause of suspition, for any of those bring ex∣trinsicke danger, or intrinsicke errours from both which you must liue free and vnattained. You shall heare many speake sometimes through their owne imperfections sometime to proue yours,Speeches. and sometimes to please (as they thinke) the com∣panie: but you must know that all hearts are not of one complexion: and you shall hazard euer to Card ill, that play to please one by displeasing another, since benefits euer bee more easily forgotten then iniures, and though the respect of common friendship (and almost societiere) quire otherwise; yet such wrongs are without meanes of reuenge, and good turnes are without memorie of recompence.Inconstancie. You must auoide incon∣stancie and the very appearance of lightnesse as a dangerous downefall: for where it is, there is neither vnderstanding or iudgment to discerne the actions of others nor grauitie to measure that which properly belongeth to your selfe: be∣sides the world by taking notice of your infirmitie will al∣wayes feare volubilitie in all your actions. Finally, though I am most assured vertue hath so great power in your minde, and your owne vnderstan∣ding
so full of all good thinges, that you may be an ex∣ample to my precepts: Yet I will say this, not as nee∣ding, but in the necessitie of my loue; which desireth more then it doubteth of. Giue your selfe (deare Bro∣ther) to learne of the best: fashion your selfe to the most worthie examples which you haue seene, aspire to nothing for vanitie or ostentation, neglect no good thing for feare, and mingle equally awfulnesse to offend, and diligence to proceed worthily in all your actions: And you shall haue fauour from the King, loue from the best, hatred from none, securitie from all, honour from the effects which will proceed from your doings; and God will blesse you with his mercie, directing your wayes to his glorie, to good ends: and so to good exam∣ple among these misbeleeuers, with whō for a time it is your fortune to liue, and to raise from this place, a long lasting glorie and reputation to your selfe; and name for euer. And this was all my exceeding sorrow could force it selfe to vtter: and the King returning also (whom my Brother must follow) interrupted the course of any longer discourse of mine, or his answer. But when I came to Casbin, though I knew his mind both by nature, and learning, as plentifully furnished as a Gentleman might be, who had hopefull conditi∣ons in himselfe, and all the additions which the tender care of friendes, and his owne diligently well-spent time could giue him: Yet vnderstanding well in how dangerous a sea his young years were to nauigate, and that no addition of prouidence could be superfluous firmely to support his owne securitie, and the maine end of our great businesse: hauing compiled (as well as
the shortnesse of the time of my abiding in that place would suffer me, and as much as I could bring to any sort of fashiō out of so imperfect a mould as that of my little vnderstanding) these remnants of the chiefe pro∣perties of al estates, to giue him the better light how clearly to see into that wherin he was; and to helpe the way of his businesse, according to the motiues which it was like) he might receiue by the commaundement of some of our Princes from hence: desiring him with all to remember, that Court carriages were riddles, which though seene, could not bee resolued without ex∣ceeding patience, and well iudging experience. And that by no meanes hee should flie from his owne vertue, to make his foundation vpon the Kings fauor, Princes euer hauing this imperfection almost inseparable to their greatnesse, to be infinite voluble, and as their minds are large, so they easily ouerlooke their first fauours, which they purposed, and can as hardly loue truly, as acknowledge a bene∣fite: their disposition being to be easily glutted with the pre∣sent, and hope better of the future, especially hauing no other necessity in the constāt carrying of their affections, then their owne satisfactions. And these other trifles which I lent him, I did wish him to ouerlooke as grounds, only for his spirit to discourse more largely vpon: desiring by them to point vnto him that exercise, which the cause that wee were entred in, made not onely fittest for his minde to vse, but most necessarie; our fortune hauing then giuen into our management the good or ill of di∣uers states, according to the successe of our employ∣ment. And since there is a certaine iudgement of the euent of things, according to the perfect or imperfect disposition of the body, by which those things are to be effected: his iudge∣ment
would bee the better to discourse, and discerne what the proceeding of this businesse was like to be, by vnderstanding the principal elements, by which the body of all estates are compacted, and then by dilating with himselfe the good or defectiue mixture in euery particular state, which hee knew by his owne experi∣ence and others relation. Those Elements which giue both matter and being, to those huge bodies, were Counsell, Force, and Re∣putation. The Forme, were the Lawes which Aristotle calleth Mens sine appetitu. The Organ by which this worke, and the whole bo∣dy moueth to his end, is the Prince and his Ministers. But because the time I had was so short as I could but briefly speake of all these, I did conclude them in the Discourse which I gaue him of these three maine founda∣tions, Counsell, Force, and Reputation. FINIS.
