A New BALLAD Being a Comparison between one that cut off his own Nose, and another that cut his own Throat to gain Renown. Tune of Hang sorrow cast away care, &c. I. THere is an old story That's much to the Glory Of one that was called Sophyrus, Whose Feats may be read Though the man be dead By any that are desirous. II. This man had a Nose As you may suppose In the middle of his face But cut it off clear Like a brave Cavaliere To get the Kings good grace. III. The manner is known So wee'l let that alone Yet by the way you must note Though he slashed his face In every place He had a great care of his throat. IV. Now will any man dare This Wight to compare With an Heroe that I can name Who by cutting his throat Grew a man of great note And purchas'd Eternal Fame. V. Sophyrus did well But he doth excel If he be but right understood For tis a plain case As the Nose on his Face It was done for the peoples good. VI. The design was brave The people to save By letting his own throat bleed But the Fiend that repines At all good designs Did hinder it to succeed. VII. For his hand being up To spill the last drop Of the peoples saving blood He made him flinch At the tother inch And so prevented the goodâ–ª VIII So he useth his throat For the people to Vote Yet some are so wicked to hope This obligeing knife Though it spared his life Has mark't a fair place for the Rope. IX. Now who ever bares spleen To the King or the Queen Or to James the Duke of York, He shall have my Vote To cut his own Throat Provided he'l perfect the work. A. T. FINIS.
