The loving Lad, and the Coy Lass. Being a pleasant and witty Discourse between a young Man and a Maid. To a pleasant New Tune. Man. ALl haile thou bright and bonny Lass, my joy and onely sweeting, Good Fortune now hath brought to passe, that we should have a meeting. That so I might behold thy face and speak my mind unto thee, And since here is a fitting place, I do intend to wooe thee. For I long time have lov'd the well, but yet I ne, re did show it, Because indeed the truth to tell, I durst not let thee know it. For fear thou shouldst my love disdain, and so in coyness shun me, And not my person entertain, which would have quite undone me. But now I have more courage gain'd and am resolvd to try thee, For my affection is unfeign'd how canst thou then deny me. Maid I prethee Will be soft and sweet, methinks you are too hasty, O talk no more of wooing yet for fear your Master baste ye. You are as yet a Prentice Will. then leave such fond adventures, And think not of a wife untill, y'ave serv'd out your indentures. For why I think there's no time lost, but you may longer tarry Your age is twenty years at most, a little to young to marry. Then take my councel if you please, and rest a while contented, Forbear such rash attempts as these, which oft times are repented, Man. Indeed I wish I able were, to follow your direction, But little dost thou know my Dear. The Second part, to the same Tune. For where true love the heart doh sway in any Loyal Lover He cannot brook one weeks delay, but must his mind discover. Love burns so hot within my breast that if I should conceal it, Besure 'twould never let me rest, until; I did reveal it, Therefore sweet loving Mistresse Jane, consider my condition, My heart with love is almost slain, O! prove a kind Physitian. Maid. Fye, fye, thou art a flattering youth, I do not like thy carriage, Leave off such toys for in good truth, they will thee quite disparage. Think it not strange that I am coy, or that I have deny'd thee. I never will affect a Boy, what ever doth betide me, Herein I do thee not disgrace, but speak as doth behove me For thou never hadst a Manlike face, therefore I cannot love thee. Man. Oh my Dear that's a killing word, I preth√©e henceforth forbear it, And let thy sweet lips some comfort afford speak kindly that I may hear it. I Prize thee more than Gold or Pearl, thou art my onely Iewel, Then prethee do not frown my Girle, why thouldst thou be so cruel. It thou contimtest to deny, and thus in scorn to slight me, Then surely I for love must dye, Oh! do not so requite me. But if thoul't grant me love at last, and yield thy self unto me, My grief and sorrows which are past, no harme at all can do me. For in thy love I shall rejoyce even as, it will behove me, And thou shalt find (my onely choice) how dearly I do love thee. Maid It that indeed your words be true, and you do so affect me, Grant this request and that will shew, how much you do respect me, Live for my sake a single life, untill seven years be ended, And then for to become your wife, I fully am intended. But if the same you do refuse, great cause I have to suspect you, Another mate you may go chuse, for I will never affect you. Man My Dear that is a difficult talk, and yet I tell the truly, Since thou art pleas;d the same to ask I will perform it duely, Full seven years space for thy sweet sake a Batchelor I'le tarry, And else all other Maids forsake with my True-love marry. Now give me leave to kisse thy hand,, Maid my leave is quickly gained, Man. The sweetest Damosel in the Land, at last I have obtained.
