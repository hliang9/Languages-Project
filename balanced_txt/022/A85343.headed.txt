Good English: Or, Certain REASONS Pointing out the safest way of Settlement in this KINGDOM; Drawne from the nature of the Aims and Jnterests of the severall Parties ingaged; and as the Case now stands, this second day of MAY. 1648. A Peece of serious observation, wherein the secrets of every Party, as they stand in a probability of Complyance, or Oppo∣sition to His Majesty, are fully discovered. Seneca in Hercule fur: —Prosperum ac foelix scelus, Virtus vecatur. Sontibus parent boni. Ius est in armis. Quaritur belli exitus, Non Causa: Nunc pereat omnis memoria, Et victor arma ponat, & victum decet Deponere Odia.— Printed in the Yeere 1648.
To the Lord Generall Fairfax. My Lord, THis plaine Pamphlet was written partly for your sake, and those under your Command, that you may at length consider what necessitie lies upon you, to secure your selves, and settle this Kingdom by an humble, honorable, and speedy reconcilement with His Majesty. Know this, that what I have written here, is written couragiously, and without respect of Persons: And because the truth of it is of so universall concernment, that it requires the per∣usall of all sores of men within the Kingdome, I have sent it abroad in a more homely stile than usuall, that it may find entertainment in the meanest capacities. The reason that induced me to make this Addresse unto your Lordship is, because it aimes principally at your Inte∣rest, who are the Captaine of that Army, which hitherto hath lengthened our miseries by breach of Faith with the King, and Kingdom: And though I am apt to believe (as well as others) that you had the least share in that odious and abominable designe of imprisoning our Soveraigne; yet the world knowes you may (if you please) and is almost perswaded you will, become the happy instrument of his deliverance. It is the humor of our owne and other Nations to talke, as if the Military Affaires were swayed wholly by your Lievtenant-Generall. I cannot tell how farre he and his potent Party may have wrought upon you heretofore by specious Arguments, or presumed to act many Extrava∣gancies at such a time when you could not safely oppose them; but this I assuredly know, that they are all laid upon your score, and that now is the time wherein you may quit
scores, and become your selfe, who of your selfe (I am con∣fident) are indued with such excellent principles of honor, reason, and resolution, that you cannot but doe like your selfe, having so faire an oportunity. Nor is it may opinion only, but the hope and perswasion of many gallant men, which yet retaine some thoughts of honor concerning you, for your bravery and civility in your Conquests. Oh, let not the memory of them (which may be applauded in after-times, though not for the Cause, yet for the gallant performance) be obliterated by sinister and prodigious undertakings! Remember that you stand in the rank of Nobility, and may transmit this honor with the ad∣dition of greater, unto your Posterity; acquit then your self nobly, and let not the fountain from whence you derived your honor, be thus prophaned, and vilified by the very filth of the people. Consider the miseries that must fall upon your Country, by an Army of hungry Strangers now ready to invade us: Imagine that the eyes of the Nation are up∣on you, as one that may prevent all, or at least shorten their abode here, by uniting with his Majestie. Banish that accursed Principle of not trusting an injured Prince, which becomes none but implacable and incorrigible Trai∣tors. See that such Terms be propounded unto him, that may not clash either with his Conscience or Honor, that it may appear unto all men, you desire Peace at his hands, who is the most peaceable, pious, gracious Prince living. But if you entertain other Counsells, know that you will be look'd on by the people, as the cause of all those desolations which shall befall them; and the time of Revenge will come, (from above) wherein you shall with sorrow, confesse your neglect of this honest Advice, given from a private hand, that would thinke it an honor to kisse yours, if your Lord∣ship please first to kisse Majestie's, upon just and honorable con∣ditions.
Good English: OR, Certaine Reasons pointing out the safest way of settlement in this Kingdome. Drawne from the nature of the aimes, and Interests of the severall parties ingaged; and as the case now stands, this second day of May, 1648. First, by reasons drawne from the Interest of the Royall Episcopall Party. HIs Majesty must owe the ruine of his affaires, to the emu∣lation of his Superior Officers, and the security and intem∣perance of the Inferiour. The Houses (though Conquerors) must attribute the great deficiency and instability of their affaires, to private Interest and Faction; the very Twins of all popu∣lar ingagements. The Factions are divided into these two notions, Presbyterian, and Independent; both of them humours inconsistent with the true temper of the Body Politique of England: And they may fitly be compared unto two poysons of a contrary quality, which maintai∣ning a war within the Body naturall, vex it with many dire symptoms, to the disturbance of the whole Oeconomy; and never rest, till being evacuated by some strong Purger, or else tired out by re-action, the strife ends: And so nature recovering her first vigor, reduces the Body into its former state. Such as the event in this case, is in the body of man, the like may we expect at length, to be the issue of these counter-workings of the two venemous Factions, within the bowells of this Land. For, it must needs be, either that in long running they will tire out each other; or else the Constitutions of the people not being a∣ble to beare them any longer, they may at last be vomited out of the Nation. But rather than the Kingdom should be tormented, in expectation of the issue of so pernicious a Conflict betwixt those two extremes, it were convenient, his Majesty, as a third party,
should speedily clap in, to ballance the one against the other, or else conquer both; there being but these two wayes to end the Controversie. Touching the Conquest of both (though it be the farthest way about) he hath one maine advantage which may carry him through with the work; and that is the large Empire which he yet holds in the hearts of his people, which is exceedingly confirmed and dai∣ly augmented, by reason of those intolerable burthens that lie upon them; the sense whereof makes them looke upon the King, as their companion in misery, and on the two Factions, as the Fountaines from whence all these evills flow. As for Foraine aids, it is confessed, the Affairs of Christendom are at this time so disposed, and every Potentate so exhausted, or inga∣ged, that some want leisure; others, ability to assist him: And o∣thers that have both ability, and leisure, yet refraine out of some particular Reasons of State. The Spaniard hath his hands full every way, and hath more cause to seeke to repaire himselfe, than assist others: The French are his Invaders; the Portugalls, Revolters; and the Neapolitans, Rebells. The French are busie in maintaining what they have gotten, and seeking after more: But if they were at leisure, little might be ex∣pected from them, unlesse it were to foment our differences, and as they first helped to unsettle us, so still to keep us from setling, that England (which is the ballancing power of Europe, and her King Arbiter orbis Christiani, the Arbitrator in all differences of Christendome) being broken by her owne strength at home, might have none to spend abroad, to hinder that prodigious design, where∣in the late successes of the French have heightned them to become Rivalls and Competitors with the Spaniard, for an Ʋniversall Mo∣narchy. Denmark hath enough to do in repairing those ruines, which were brought on them by the late Swedish Incursions. The Hollanders esteem it a safe way to conform themselves e∣ver to the prevailing party in England, seeing they have a great part of their livelyhood by Indulgence from the English Nation: More∣over, though at first they esteemed the Match of the Prince of O∣range with the eldest daughter of England, as a matter of much honour; yet now they look upon it as a businesse that in time may prove of ill consequence; fearing so great an alliance might dis∣pose the Prince to aspire, and establish a greater Interest of his own, than is meet for a Member of a Republike, if Monarchy were at its
height againe in England. And, further many among the Dutch, supposing that the Grandees here aime at the same forme of Go∣vernment with themselves, doe flatter themselves in conceit, that such a neighbourhood would be willing to admit of a nearer friend∣ship and complication of Interests, than can be hoped for from a Monarchy, though there be farre more reason to suspect the con∣trary. So that wee see how little his Majesty may expect from any of his Neighbors: And truly, it is no small part of our happinesse in the midst of these distractions, that we have had, and are like to have, so little of their Company. The hopes then of his Majesties restitution being wholly founded upon the affections of his People, and bounded within his owne Dominions, let us take a view of each within their station. The Scots seem to bee divided among themselves; some pretend absolutely for his Majesty; others, only upon condition of signing the Cove∣nant &c. In Ireland a Cessation will open a way for supplies out of that Kingdome. In Wales, they are in arms already for his Majesty, and all the Royall Party in England wait but for an Oportunity in the same way, to free themselves from their present vassalage, under the power of the Independent party in the Houses; wherein likewise the Presbyterian party are as much concerned as any, seeing the other of Brethren, are become their bitter enemies, and would shew them as little courtesie, as others, were it not to stop the mouthes of their leading men at home, and in hope to work upon the prime Presbyters in Scotland. What the Refult of the Scotish resolutions will be, is yet not certainly knowne. If the pretending royall party there carry an In∣gagement simply for the King, no doubt but the Royallists here joyning with them, they may finish the work by subduing both the Factions: But if they bring in a mixt Ingagement, for the King and the Covenant (which we have great cause to fear,) I conceive the Royallists ought not to joyne with them, but to expect and indea∣vour a Close with the Independent party; who will be forced for their owne safety, to wave their high-flowne Resolutions, and be∣think themselves of a Complyance with his Majesty; which ought rather to be sought after and imbraced (as lesse dangerous to the royall Prerogative) than a close with the Presbyterian. Touching the probabilitv and conveniency of a Complyance be∣twixt his Majesty and the Independent party, in case the Scots ingage for Presbyterie, I shall endeavour to fortifie my opinion by unde∣niable
Reasons: But first give me leave to manifest the great dan∣ger of closing with the Presbyterian Party, though accompanied with never so many specious pretences. That a Scotish Ingaging for the Covenant (resolved on, as it seems) will be clearly destructive to Monarchicall Interest, I shall prove in severall particulars. First, because they aim thereby at the introduction of Presbyterie, and the over-turning of Episcopacy, the maine pillar of Monarchy, as it hath ever been esteemed in this Nation. And therefore it was, that all the Kings of England, from time to time, have so willingly sworne, to grant and to preserve unto the Bishops, and to the Churches commited to their Charge, all Canoni∣call privileges, and due Law and Justice, and to protect and defend them &c. And King JAMES, who had long experience of the sad effects of the alteration of that Government in the Church of Scotland, was so fully convinced of the neare relation betwixt Episcopacie and Monarchy, that hee left this for a sure Aphorism to his Posterity, No BISHOP No KING. For, it having been of so long continuance here, and deeply rooted in the Lawes of this Kingdom, it must needs be that a change in the one, will work an alteration in the other. Secondly, The Truth hereof was so well knowne to the Master∣builders of this Reformation, whose Aime appears now to have been ab origine (how contrary soever their Pretences were) for an alte∣ration of the civill government; that they first began their work with pulling downe of Episcopacie, that in the ruines thereof they might lay the foundation of their new designe. Thirdly, It is very apparent of what ill consequence, the extirpation of Episcopacie will be to his Majesty, seeing it is a meanes to clip the Crowne of a very considerable part of its Revenues, which by the Lawes of the Land, are annexed thereunto; as the collation of Bishop∣ricks and Deaneries; the first fruits and profits of their Lands and Revenues, during their vacancies; the first fruits and yearly Tenths out of all Ecclesiasticall Promotions; and sundry other privileges, profits, and emoluments, arising out of the State Ecclesiasticall. Fourthly, to ingage for Presbytery, is to indeavour the intro∣ducing of a Democraticall form of Government, which is directly incompatible with a Monarchy; and as it cannot stand with the power of our government, so it withstands the Honour of our Go∣verner, debasing the Majesty of Monarchy into a popular parity, with∣out respect of his most sacred Person. Fifthly, by ingaging for Presbyterie, they labor to erect a power in the State Ecclesiasticall distinct from that of the Civill: for it is a
Maxim among all Presbyters, and we find it pleaded for at large in the Confession of Faith agreed upon by the Assembly at Westminster (which as yet the Houses have been more wise than to confirme) that there ought to be a power in the Church distinct from that of the Civill: which Tenet of distinction must bee the same in effect with that of the Church of Rome's supremacy; seeing, those which now plead for a power without the Ci∣vill, will not bee long before they arrive to such a height of presum∣ption, as to act above it, or against it, in pursuance of their own designes. It will be a hard matter to keep such a Governmeut within its limits, in a∣ny Common-wealth, and therefore with much difficulty will it submit to bee governed by a free Monarchy; especially a Democracie of this new Nature, which makes the same Persons civill Subjects, and ecclesiasticall Superiors. Sixthly, it is not like that Presbyterie should prove the Mother of Peace, considering that shee was born the Daughter of sedition, and hath ever since been nursed up by Tumults and Rebellion. For, Geneva was the Land of her Nativity, where M. Calvin was her Father; and no doubt, considering the state of those Affairs & conditions of men, among whom hee was conversant, it was a commendable invention, and very necessa∣ry for bridling the tumultuous Humors in a free City; And so far we may beleeve hee intended it, yeelding to a popular Parity, and not as an uni∣versall perpetuall form of government for all reformed Churches. Seventhly, it is observable, that this ill weed hath growne in none but popular gardens, in some parts of France and Germany, till some seditious Planters and Waterers, caused it to spring up among the Thistles of Scot∣land: And of what sad consequence it hath proved to Monarchicall government in that Kingdom, let the world judge: For, the Foundation of it was laid in the ruine of our King's Grandmother, and the superstru∣cture continued, to the perpetuall discontent and vexation of his Father, till hee was most happily possessed of the Crown of England; Nor could hee have been secure here, but that by his great wisedom hee staved it off: And now at length, the Faction having with great subtilty gotten foot∣ing in this Kingdom, wee see at this day, how faire a stroke it hath given toward the ruine of his Son, our most gracious Soveraigne, and his whole Posterity. For, though he languish now under the power of the other Fa∣ction, yet the first designe of war was laid in and by Presbyterie, and his Majesty suffered Restraint first under the Presbyterian power; whose au∣dacious carriage toward his Person, in hope to tire him out of his noble principles, taught others so much impudence, as to endeavour to serve their ends upon him, by a close imprisonment. Eightly, seeing His Majesty is resolved to keep so close to his Prin∣ciples, (as is well knowne unto all the world) that he will never yeeld
to the extirpation of Bishops, what then may we expect from a Presby∣teriall Ingagement, but that when they have made use of the King's Name to quell the Independent Faction, as the Independent did to quell them, they will upon his Majesties refusall of their demands, (which he hath ever declared to be against his conscience and honor) returne a∣gaine to their old vomi, and either keep his Majesty in the same con∣dition he now is, or worse, till they can settle themselves and their pernicious Presbytery, past all hope of remedy? And then (perhaps) he shall be called out of prison to be manacled in his Throne, as his Father was in Scotland, who could never act, but when they pleased to let him; and then onely according to their Directory of Kirk and State. From hence (I conceive) we may positively and plainely affirme, that the Issue of a Presbyterian Ingagement (though usher'd in with never so many specious pretences for his Majesty) will be utterly destructive to the Royall Interest of this Kingdom: And therefore if the Scots come in upon such termes, the Royall Party ought not to ingage with them, nor to countenance them, but to expect, and indeavour a Complyance with the Independent, as I shall further illustrate by reason. First, though some may object that it cannot stand with his Majesties Honor to comply with those, that have already abused his inclination in that particular: yet if they duly consider, what urgencie lies at pre∣sent upon his Majesty, and how little hope there is of any better way of restitution, they may conceive it far more politique to obey necessity, than stand upon nice Punctillo's of honor; which I must confesse a Prince in prosperity ought to have regard unto, ad conservandam Maje∣statem Imperii; but if once he be trampled under the feet of fortune, ceremonious respects must be laid aside, to Court the first Oportunity, which reason shall point out, for a deliverance. Secondly, if it be objected, that the Independent party have a designe for alteration of government, I answer, so I believe the Presbyters have too; onely here is all the difference betwixt them, that the Independents would not have a King so much as in Name, the Scots Presbyters would have no more but the Name of a King: The one aimes downright at an Aristocraticall forme of Government; the other pretends to maintain Monarchicall Government, yet actually destroyes the very Principles of Monarchy. And as for the Independent, it is cleare by their imprison∣ing of the King, their declaring against him, and to settle the Kingdom without him, that they have had, and still may continue a designe to change the Kingly Government, and (in plaine termes) declare them∣selves Free Sates, if by any meanes they can allay the Scots: But there being little hopes of that, we may guesse how unable they are to main∣taine their Station, having over-strained the sinews of the City, and the heart-strings, of the Country; and so it is probable they will scarce be so hardy as to venture, to stand upon their single leggs, against the streame
of a generall dis-affection at home, and an invasion by their opposite Facti∣on from abroad; but may, when there is no hope of carrying on their designe any longer that way, retreat with moderation toward His Majesty. Thirdly, seeing it is dangerous, in case the Scots come in for Presbyte∣ry, that the Royall party should ingage with them, it is all the reason in the world they should with speed indeavour an Agreement with the Independent: For, if Presbytery receive a foile from the Independents, then they will undoubtedly be heightned with confidence to prosecute their designe against Monarchy, and (perhaps) in time attaine so much pow∣er, as to establish themselves: And on the other side, if Independency re∣ceive a foile from the Presbyters, then Presbyteriall Government will usurp over Monarchy; both which inconveniencies will be prevented by a timely close with the Independent. For, there is no other way to re∣establish his Majesty, unlesse we suppose his Party able to carry it by force of Armes against both the Factions: which (if it were possible) cannot be effected without length of time, extreme difficulty, and the sad consequences of a Second War. Fourthly, an Agreement with the Independent is the only way to hin∣der a Second war. For, They being Possessed of all, or most of the places of strength in this Kingdom, and back't besides with an Army, it must needs bee, that an Ingaging against them, cannot be carried on to a Conquest, but through a Sea of Bloud, and a generall devastation: whereas an union betwixt them and his Majesty, contracted upon mode∣rate, just, and equitable grounds, in relation to his Majesties Interests and due Rights, and the People's Birthright, will bee a meanes not only to prevent the afore-said Mischeife; but so quell the Presbyterian Party in England, that they shall not bee able to countenance any Scotish de∣signes: And so, if the Scots do attempt an Invasion upon any Pretence whatsoever, the Warr will bee brought home to their owne dores. Fifthly, seeing there is a necessity of some form, it is probable the Complyance will extend so far, as to let us have Bishops again. And there is so much the more hope, in regard the Independents have not yet abso∣lutely agreed to the settling of any one particular way of Church-Go∣vernment; the execution of all Ordinances hitherto in relation to Pres∣byterie, being permitted merely out of policie to pacifie that Faction for a time, and not out of any respect to the Government it selfe; which they looke upon as far more destructive to liberty, and which brings in ten thousand such Inconveniences and Pressures, as are not incident in a well-regulated Episcopacy. Sixthly, if it bee objected, that there is little hope of the Independents yielding to Bishops, seeing they have been as deeply ingaged in the sale of their Lands, as ever Presbyters were; it must bee considered, that what they have done in this kind of Robbery, was only (as their elder Brethren
the Presbyters, gave them example) in order to their Designe for alte∣ration of Government; which now being forced to quit (as anon I shall prove) by invincible necessity, some other waies may and must bee taken for the satisfaction of the souldiery than by the Goods of the Church. And then likewise it will bee no hard matter to make our pur∣chasing Cormorants, to vomit up all their sweet Sacrilegious Morsels. Lastly, though most of the Royall Party are rendred wholly averse to a Close with the Independent Party, as Persons not to bee dealt with, by reason of their grosse Juglings with his Majesty; yet give me leave to say, that as their Ambition, avarice and over-weening confidence, were the causes of their declining those faire Proposals and Pretences of their first Ingagement, supposing that then they had an Oportunity to doe what they pleased; so now being deceived in their expectations, and having found by experience, that they are not able to go through with their Designe; and it being cleare also (as I shall manifest) that they have no hope of Safety, or, continuance in this Kingdom, but by a Cordiall Close with his Majesty, wee have little or no Cause to feare a second Baffle upon sophisticall Pretences, in time to come; especially if his Majestie's wisdom bee laid in the Balance with their Necessity. And so for these Reasons I conceive, we may boldly affirm; that as the roy∣all Party ought by no meanes to admit of an Ingagement with, or for Presbyterte (though set on foot with the fairest Pretences:) so their true Interest at present is to seek, and imbrace a timely discreet Complyance with that Party Paramount of this Kingdom, which they call Independent. II. Reasons drawn from the Interest of the ruling Independent Party. WHen first his Majesty became a Prisoner to the Independent Par∣ty, the Kingdom (as well as himselfe) was filled with great hope of such a mutuall Complyance betwixt him and them, as might usher in the long-desired settlement of this distracted Nation: Our expectations in this particular were exceedingly heightned by the many specious De∣clarations, Representations, and Proposalls, sent abroad from the Army; which promised much, in relation to the just Rights of his Majesty, and his Royall Posterity, and the true satisfaction of all Interests, as well as their owne; together with many glorious pretences of moderation toward those of the Royall Party, and the easing of all burthens which lay upon the Subject. These were indeed most rich and glorious pretences: And without controversie this way of Complyance was at that time their true Ineterest, and had they prosecuted it according to their Proposalls, they had laid a stable foundation of their owne and the Kingdoms future happinesse. But they, forsaking the true paths which led to Peace, immediately fell a wandring from these Principles in such an erroneous course, that as the wiser sort of men fore-saw, so themselves now begin to feare and feele,
the fatall consequences of their wretched dissimulation; which is like to bring no lesse sorrow upon the Ring-leaders of that Faction, than it hath done already upon their Fellow-Subjects, and their Soveraigne. The Reasons which induced them to deale so perfidiously with his Majesty, were (no doubt, as I mentioned before) Ambition and Avarice; as hath since appeared by their seizing all places of profit, in the hands of themselves, and their Kindred, and Creatures: And also by their grosse and palpable designings for a change of Monarchicall Government. Upon a Change (for certain) they were all resolved; but what new form to introduce in the place of it, was unknowne, and is as yet at this day, even to the principall among themselves. For, as the Cause at first was split into the two Factions of Presbyterian and Independent; so this of Independency is sub-divided into that Party which is commonly called Independent, and the other Party, most rightly called Levellers. The Grandees of that Party commonly called Independent, are some of the superior Officers of the Army, and Members of either House; the greatest part of whom are visible in the State-Committee at Derby-house: And though when his Majesty was first imprisoned, they then pretended, and would still seem, to be one in designe with the Levellers, yet time hath manifested their aim to be at an Aristocraticall Form of Govern∣ment, and (in plaine terms) to declare themselves and their select Confe∣derates FREE STATES. The other Party called Levellers, consist onely of some Colonells and Commanders of Inferiour Rank in the Army, with whom are joy∣ned some few Members of the Commons House, and a confused Rabble of Sectaries in the Army, City, and Suburbs, and some parts of the Coun∣try. Their aime is at a Democraticall form of Government; investing the power wholly in the people: So that this wild Faction ex professo, are enemies alike both to Monarchy and Optimacy, and will be governed neither by Kings, nor States. Hence it was, that as soon as his Majesty was juggled away into the Isle of Wight, the superior Officers, in order to their State-designe, saw there was a necessity of crushing the Levellers Party, after that they had served their ends upon them, by drawing them into an ingaging upon the same pretended common Principles with themselves. And therefore their first work was with all speed to dissipate the Councell of the Army, contrary to their first ingagement, and surprize them with a new ingage∣ment at Ware, destructive to the other at New-Market; whereinto the Souldiery were partly allured by soothings, and partly driven by terror, one of their fellow-souldiers being condemned for resistance, by a Councell of Warre, and shot to death before their faces at the generall Rendezvous. The Levellers Party being thus quell'd, there remained yet one Rub more in the way to this new STATE, and that was the Presbyter Party:
As for the Royall Party, they were crushed alreadie, undone for want of their Estates, or by unmeasurable Compositions to regain them, and their King reduced to a forlorn despicable condition of imprisonment, so that it was presumed, he or they could have little hope, or meanes to revive againe: There remained then onely the Gulph of Presbytery to saile through to their desired Haven. They knew very well, that the Breasts of the Presbyterians boiled high with indignation and revenge against them, as their contrary Fa∣ction, that had over-awed and subdued them by force and subtilty, to be∣come possessors of what was once theirs, and share in the glory of that new Government, which had been designed, and devoured in hope long before, by the Presbyters: Therefore the Presbyterian being a potent Fa∣ction, by reason of the great interest it hath in the City of London, and their neare union with Scotland, and indeed the major Party in the House on their side, if it were not over-awed; they judged it necessary to bethinke themselves of some way to pacifie the Presbyterians. To this end they first fell to bribing of the grand Presbyterian-sticklers in the House, either with sums of money in recompence of pretended losses, or of Arreares, or else with great Offices, which staid their stomacks, and held the rest of the Presbyters in suspence, upon hope of the like in time according to their merits. As for the Scots, it was with high confidence presumed, that they might bee taken off upon good valuable Considerations; wherein the aspiring States have not been wanting by prodigious Offers, though all will not prevaile. As for the City, if after the pacifying of the Presbyterian in the House, they could likewise have made sure of the Scots connivence, the Presby∣terian Party of Londoners must have fallen of course, as not able to stand out by themselves. And so here now we have a full view of the Designe of the present ruling Independent Party: For, if after they had crushed the Levellers, they could by any meanes have made sure work with the Presbyters at home and in Scotland, then there had been nothing betwixt them and home, but his Majesty and his posterity, who being all of them at their Disposition and power, besides the Prince, and hee not likely to receive much comfort by succour from foraine Parts, I leave the world to judge, what should have been the consequence of their wretched designe. But since it appeares (and themselves are now perswaded in their hearts,) that God hath otherwise determined concerning his sacred Majesty, and his numerous flourishing posterity; seeing their last hopes faile them, and they begin to languish in the Close of their Work, cer∣tainly it is high time to retreat, before the Dore be bolted against all hope of Pacification; and it must needs bee their true Interest, to recall his Majesty, to let him Treat with freedom, and bethink themselves of
some necessary expedients toward an honorable, equall, and perfect reconciliation; as the only meanes, of safety to Themselves, comfort to their afflicted King, and peace to these distressed Kingdoms; which I shall indeavour to prove by strength of Reason. First, though it bee a Maxim among godlesse Statesmen, never to trust Princes whom they have highly offended: yet if the Independent Gran∣dees should have no other assurance upon Agreement, than his Majestie's bare word for their Jndempuity, I am confident they might trust him; it being a knowne Principle ingrafted in his nature, not only by morall Impression, but also by Christian perswasion, to forgive those that have persecuted him, and dispightfully used him: For, undoubtedly, the whole Course of his life hath manifested him (if men would lay aside their Splene, and but speake their Consciences) to bee of a most gracious inclination, equall to any of his Predecessors, and an exact patern of true Clemency to succeeding Generations. Secondly, there is no doubt, but that upon Termes of Agreement, his Majesty will condescend to give any reall assurance for their security that shall in reason bee required; that is, so it extend not to the In∣fringement of his just Rights and royall Prerogative: For, it must bee ever supposed, that where an Accommodation is intended betwixt ad∣verse Parties, there must bee a Condescension on both sides, wherein the ordinary Principles of right Reason and Equity must bee the Rule: For, if either side keep to any one extreme, the old enmity will never want Fuell, and so the very Pretences of Accommodation will bee utterly de∣stroyed, and end in more furious flames of Dissension. Thirdly, there is a necessity of their Complyance with his Majesty, be∣cause the hatred of the People is so great, that if once they receive a Foile upon Battell; there is little possibility of recruiting, when the Hearts and purses of both City and Country are shut against them: And therefore it were madnes for men to set their whole Stock at one Cast, and hazard the fortune of themselves and Friends, upon the uncertain, chance of one single Conflict; whereas wise men, before they pitch upon Enterprizes of so high a Nature, cast about rather how to repaire them∣selves upon occasion of losse, than dream altogether of Ʋictory: For, such a provident Jealousy usually leads men to fafety, whilst the con∣sident imaginary prosperity of Fooles destroyes them. Fourthly, None can have greater cause of Jealousie touching the suc∣cesse of their owne Affaires, than the present ruling Grandees now have: For, besides the instability of their condition in respect of contrary Hu∣mors and parties ready to ingage against them at home, it is visible, that they will bee invaded from abroad. The Covenant-Faction of the Scots are concerned in point of Interest, to wage war against them, for the re∣storing of their party againe in England; and his Majesties Party in Scotland will not (as indeed they ought not) stand neutrall: And
though they have great hopes here, that the difference between his Majestie's Party and the Covenanters there, touching the Nature of an In∣gagement against England, may rise so high, as by busying them against each other, to keep them from ingaging this way at all; yet rather than suffer things to remaine at this passe in England, it is evident they will super∣sede all bandyings among themselves, and consider of some middle way, wherein to mannage their Counsels and resolutions, to bee revenged up∣on the Independent Usurpers. Besides, it is very observable, that the late falling away in Ireland, may from a cessation, proceed to a perfect Peace with the Irish, and then both joyne in one against the Houses for the re∣storing of his Majesty. In the mean time, the Cessation will make way for Supplyes & auxiliary Forces out of that Kingdom, to joyn with any discon∣tented Party in this; where it is evident, that the People are so far exaspe∣rated, that they will joyne with the Scots, Irish; yea, or the Turk, upon hope of freeing themselves & restoring their King, rather than continue in thraldom, at the will and pleasure of their present Lords and Masters. Fifthly, though the Houses have voted the sending of Forces over to hold play with Inchiquin in Munster, and so to divert his intentions from England; yet People are not so silly, but to see, they are so far unable to raise, or keep up an Army in that Country, that they want wherewithall to mainteine their owne in this. And moreover, they are now in so ill a condition to spare men, that they dare not part with any considerable peece of this Army to reduce the Welsh, for feare that if themselves were left naked, they might be surprized unawares; knowing this, that there is no sitting, without a powerfull Army to guard them; whereof they are not a little conscious, as appeares by drawing up the major part of the Army, into Quarters, at a neare distance about the City. Sixthly, as they have innumerable causes of fear from others, they wil find little ground of security even among themselves: For, if we consider the constitution of the Army, in the several parts of it, it appears to be an ag∣gregate of differing interests, opinions, & perswasions; among whom the Gran∣dees have the lesse numerous party, being over-ballanced by the Levellers, and others of the inferior Officers & private Souldiers, whom we may rec∣kon as men of fortune, who continue in the Army, not out of any devo∣tion or affection to the Cause, but only for subsistence, & therefore being rather affectionated to his Majesty, will be ready (as they receive opor∣tunity) to shew themselves in his service. And as for the Levellers, though all the industry in the world be used, to pacifie them from the remem∣brance of former injuries, and draw them in to a conjunction with the Grandees, against the King, and the Scots; yet it is probable they will ne∣ver sell their bloud and fellow-subjects at so vile a rate, as to purchase a sure dominion for such tyrannicall Masters; who, when they have help't them to do the work, will be ready (as they did before) to crush them, and pay them their wages, with perpetuall slavery.
Seventhly, their Party is very inconsiderable at Westminster, the House being no longer theirs, than whilest they over-awe it by force, as them∣selves well know: so that if it happen, the Scots come in, the Presbyteri∣an party being once back't with an Army, will soon out-vote them. And then the time will come on, wherein they shall be called to an accompt for all their forcible attempts upon the Houses and the city; and those Members that went and joyned with them therein, bee brought upon the stage for breach of trust, and have the shame of high-Treason retort∣ed upon themselves, and their August-Ingagement. Eighthly, by a timely agreement, they may settle an Interest with his Majesty, to make themselves certainly great; forasmuch as it is possible both their Interests may stand together (with discretion) entire, by the restitution of Bishops, and upon assurance given for liberty of conscience, within sober limits. Lastly, his Majesty is the very basis of peace, and the balancing power to all Parties in this Kingdom, and without him no settlement can be ex∣pected; and with whatsoever side he joynes, that will assuredly prevaile. To manifest the truth thereof, let it be remembred of what concern∣ment his complyance was to the Independents, in subduing their opposite Faction both in the Houses and the city, while he resided among them in the Army. And as by this meanes, at that time, they advanced themselves to the height of fortune; so now that they are, in the eyes of all the world, in a declining condition, they may (if they please) give a check to the triumph of their Presbyterian adversaries, by applying themselves more cordially and sincerely to the same way of complyance with his Majesty. This wil be a means to oblige him, and his Party so far that all injuries be∣ing buried in oblivion, the people gladded by the return of a long desired peace, the old enmity and malice will be soon abated, and the Royall Party and themselves strengthened in one, by an addition of the whole Body of the Nobility, Gentry and Commonalty, against all Presbyterian incroach∣ments, either within, or without the Kingdom. From all which we may sum up this conclusion; that as his Majesty is obliged in point of interest to wave all Presbyteriall Ingagements, and in∣deavour an agreement with the Independent: so likewise it appears, that the true interest of the Independent Party is, with all speed to recall those prodigious Votes of Non-Addresse, and apply themselves unto his Ma∣jesty, with such moderate desires, that may stand as well with his honor, as their safety, & be a means to remove all jealousie & distast betwixt him and them; and up∣on just and necessary grounds lay a sure foundation for a lasting peace. III. Reasons drawn from the Interest of the Presbyterian Party in England. WHence it was, and for what ends, the designe of Presbytery was first brought into this Nation, Time the mother of Truth hath at length fully manifested: for, as the pretences of it were high & glorious, so the issue hath been fallacious & dishonorable, and to it we must ascribe the
originall cause and continuance of all our miseries. That it arrived to such a hight in the opinions of many, as to be cryed up for the onely pattern of Government under the Gospel, must be imputed to the blind zeal of some, and the deceitfulnesse of others, rather then the intention of its founder, Master Calvin: For it doth not appear that he ever stretcht his model so far, as the necessity and universality of a divine right; but seems onely to have hewen part of the building out of the rock of the Scriptures, according to the literall signification, and pieced up the residue by politick and prudentiall rules, such as he conceived might sound neerest the Text, and serve most conveniently to cement the disjoynted members of that broken and tumultuous Common∣wealth of Geneva, into an entire and well compacted body. It was no sooner lick't into form there, but (as it is the fate of all things new) it began to be much extol'd and admired, and the fame thereof spreading it self in England (as well as in other parts) wrought in many of our Country-men an itching desire to go thither, and observe the manners and customes of the Government; where, of Spectators they soon became Proselites, and returning home with new affections and opi∣nions, had an evil eye upon the ancient Apostolicall government of Epis∣copacy, which they prosecuted with invective Libels from the Presse and Pulpit, as Antichristian; in the mean time extolling their new Diana, in hope to bring better advantage thereby unto themselves, then they could hope to attain under the government of Bishops: and in processe of time, their Doctrines being brought into reputation by the addition of an artificiall and counterfeit piety, they stole away the hearts of many well-meaning people throughout the Kingdom, whom they poysoned with disaffection to the present Government. So here was the rise of the old Presbyters, which passed heretofore under the names of Non conformists, or Puritans. Manifold were the Bickerings which they had with the Bishops during the reigns of Queen Elizabeth and King James; yet the Faction was then kept under hatches by great care and policy, as it was likewise all the for∣mer part of the reign of our gracious Sovereign CHARLES, though the humours began to work more strongly then ever; insomuch, that having gained a party in every Parliament; which presumed to insist upon very high particulars of Government both in Church and State, and questi∣on such Officers of both as stood in the way of their designe, his Majesty was necessitated, by reason of those audacious and factious proceedings, to a frequent dissolution of Parliaments; which though they publikely ex∣claimed against, yet inwardly they were glad enough of it, working
advantage thereby, to scandalize his Majesty, in the opinion of the peo∣ple, as one utterly disaffected to Parliaments, and that intended to govern altogether by an arbitrary power. This and other Scandals were treasured up against the time, wherein they hoped to have occasion to use them; but having often tryed their own single strength to be too weak to shake the Government, then the Grandees of the , not knowing otherwise to repair their broken for∣tunes, began to have recourse unto the Scots, a people as needy as them∣selves, and who (it was presumed) would be glad to entertain any oc∣casion to mend their Fortunes, and establish an Interest in this Nation: Be∣sides, their hope was the greater to thrive among the Scots, because they were a people that had been discountenanced and discontented by the Bishops, and had embraced the same form of Government that was aimed at by themselves, and therefore could not but be willing to contribute their best assistance toward the settlement of it in England. Therefore the motion was no sooner made from hence, but it found joyfull entertainment in Scotland, and Counsels were mutually imparted by the grand Presbyters on both sides; and in fine it was agreed, that Re∣formation should be the stalking-horse to the whole Design. The aime of the Scots therein, was the gaining of Treasure, and an union of interest with England: The aime of the English Presbyters, was the quelling of their Oppsites at Court, and supplanting them in their Offices, the destruction of Episcopacy, and with it, of Monarchy; and the enriching of themselves with the Wealth of the Kingdom, the Revenues of the Crown, and the Goods of the Church; all which become a prey unto that monster of Presbytery, till it was wrested out of their jawes, by the new brethren of the Independent party. By which brief draught of Discourse it appears, that as a great part of the Commons of England have been drawn in upon religious pretences to the faction of Presbytery, to serve worldly ends; so now that the hypocrisie and dissimulation of those proceedings is manifest unto the world, with∣out doubt the true interest of all honest-meaning Presbyters in England is the very same with that of the Nation in generall, to seek peace and ensue it, to quit all considerations of siding or faction, to open their eyes and see how they have been deceived, to loath the vanity, and prevent the mise∣ry of all engagements in and for Presbytery; to endeavour simply the re∣storing of his Majesty, and to joyn with any for that end, but with none that are contrary; and also to content themselves with a regulated Episco∣pacy, for these following Reasons. First, seeing it is most true, that there can be no settlement in this
Kingdom, but by a compliance with the royall interest, it is altoge∣ther impossible to expect peace, if a design be still cherished for the establishing Presbytery because of that absolute antipathy (or incom∣possibility) betwixt Monarchicall and Presbyteriall Government, as I have manifested before: God and Belial, light and darknesse may as soon agree together; and therefore it must not be expected, that his Ma∣jesty should yeeld up his Honour, Conscience and Crown, in sacrifice to so pernicious a rivall in his Prerogative. Secondly, if there be a fresh engaging for Presbytery to crush Inde∣pendency, what more hope of peace have we when this prevailing party shall be down, and the other up again? are we not where we were before? shall not his Majesty remain as lyable as ever to the old vex∣atious Popositions? and have not the Presbyters of the Kirk told us plainly beforehand, that they are resolved, he shall sign all their de∣sires before his resolution to the exercise of his Regall power? what then may we expect from Presbytery, after all the miseries and deso∣lations of a second War, but that his Majesty shall remain in durance, as he did at Holdenby, or does now in the Island, without all hope of remedy to himself, or end of those intolerable oppressions lying upon this afflicted Kingdom? Thirdly, it being cleer, that the design of a Presbytery hath been carried on meerly for the private ends of particular men, what mad∣nesse is it for men that pretend wisdom, Religion and godlinesse, to ha∣zard themselves and their Estates, to draw on the guilt of innocent blood by embroyling their fellow subjects, and infringe their Obli∣gations to their Soveraign, by prostituting their consciences, purses and endeavours, to serve the ambition of a few, whose practises (when they are invested with power) will be (as they ever have been) to make them share with others in the common calamity at present, and intaile slavery upon their Posterity for ever? Fourthly, Presbytery wheresoever it settles, is destructive of liberty, by reason of that popish trick taken up by the Presbyterian, in drawing all secular affaires within the compasse of their spirituall jurisdicti∣on: and this they do by means of that awe wherein they hold the consciences of the Magistrate and People; the one being lyable as well as the other, by excommunications and suspensions, to be exploded as scandalous sinners, when they please to pronounce them such; as appears by that large extent of their Authority in judging of scanda∣lous sins, which reaches almost to every action of humane life: so that
all the rest of the Kingdom, besides their favourites (from the King to the Beggar) must stoop like asses, to be ridden by a few ambitious Priests, and Lay-ignoramuses. Fiftly, a regulated Episcopacy must be the onely government for this Nation, in regard it is most suitable to the constitution of the Mo∣narchy, and the Lawes of the Land (whereto through continuance of time it hath a very neer relation) and also to the humours and good liking of the people, insomuch that the Brethren of the contrary way after all their art, industry and perswasion, have found by experi∣ence, that it is impossible to force any other upon them; therefore without all controversie, a Bishop mortified and pruned of his super∣fluities, moderated in the jurisdiction of his Court, and the compulsive power, and assisted by the Clergy of his Diocesse, will in the end ap∣pear to be the most excellent Governour. Sixtly, if any Presbyter object, that he hath sworn to the extirpa∣tion of Bishops, he may do well to consider the unlawfulnesse of such an Oath, it having never been enjoyned by any lawfull authori∣ty, but expresly without it, and against it; and moreover, to the de∣struction of that which is lawfull, viz. the government of the Church, confirmed by the Lawes of the Land; which appears also by the undoubted testimony of ancient Records and later Histories, to have been continued with an universell, uninterrupted, unquestioned suc∣cession in all the Churches of God, and in all Kingdoms that have been called Christian throughout the whole world, for fifteen hundred yeers together, without any considerable opposition made against it; and which, if it be not of divine right, hath a fairer pretension, and may lay a juster title and claim to a divine institution, then any other form of Government can do: and therefore it having been wor∣thily of such esteem in all Times and Places, and established by Law, certainly an Oath binding to extirpate it without Law and against Law, is utterly unlawfull, and so rather to be repented of, then stubbornly maintained. Seventhly, by standing out for a Presbytery, they give the more hopes and encouragement to the Independent party, to persist in a way of obstinacy against his Majesty, and oppression of the Subject; because it will be a means to hinder a cordiall joynt engaging betwixt the Presbyters and the Royall party, and enflame the old enmity, to the de∣struction of each other, whilest Independents gather strength and op∣portunity to triumph in the ruines of their division; whereas by a
speedy compliance with his Majesties interest, they may quell the pride of Independency, and either fetch them down to a composition with his Majesty; or in case they continue perverse, be surely enabled to ex∣pell them out of the Kingdom. Lastly, by a sincere, absolute close with his Majesty upon rationall grounds, they do no more then what the prevailing party among their Brethren the Scots, pretend to engage for (and truly, if their intents be otherwise, they will finde but cold entertainment in England;) therefore if the Presbyters of England would but acquit themselves like reasonable men, the work of restoring his Majesty might be done without the Scots, and all those miseries and inconveniences be a∣voyded, which must certainly follow the admission of a forreign Army; which, besides the pressures that they must bring upon the exhausted Northen parts, will expect a large retribution of Treasure for a reward of their engaging, and (perhaps) not depart in quiet, but upon such Termes, as may be exceedingly prejudiciall and dishonourable to the English Nation. From hence I once again infer, the true interest of the Presbyters, is to counter-work the Independents in their interest, which they now drive against his Majesty; and to this end, to quicken themselves to a joynt engaging with the royall party, as the onely means to beat down the ambition of the ruling Grandees of the Independent party, to prevent the miseries of a long-languishing War, with the in conve∣niences of a Scottish incursion; and also to procure the speedy settle∣ment of the King in his just Rights, and the Kingdoms in firm peace and tranquility. IIII. Reasons drawn from the interest of the City of London. This great and populous City is the epitome of the Kingdom, where∣of as it is a member, it hath the same common interest with the whole; yet being more excellent then any other part, by reason of the de∣pendance of the rest upon it, as being the principall Fountain of Traffick; and also by reason of its abundance of Wealth, the grand Priviledges of their Charter, and the multitude of their Revenues and Inhabitants, they have much the greater share in the common interest of the Nation; which is, Peace and Prosperity. The speciall interest of this City is a free trade, as well within, as without the Kingdom: The onely enemy thereto is a civill warre, which destroyes commerce betwixt man and man; whereof the Citi∣zens
have had sad experience these tumultuous times by the decay of Trading, the like hath not been many hundred yeers. So that the on∣ly way to recover againe, is to endeavour after a happy Peace; and seeing there is no possibility of attaining it, but by an establishment of his Majestie, I shall present them with a few Considerations. First, they may doe well to remember, how they were cheated heretofore with religious pretences into an Ingagement against his Ma∣jesty, and how that the whole Kingdome must owe its ruine and de∣solation to their warlike preparations and Contributions. Therfore as it hath been their unhappinesse to have the first hand in driving away the King, and un-setling the Kingdom; so let them account it their honor, to be active and industrious in bringing him back again, and to settle him in peace on the throne of the Kingdome. Secondly, in effecting this, they ought to have respect onely to the Royall Interest, without the mixture of any factious ingaging what∣soever, under pretence of Covenant, &c. lest while they seem to act in the behalfe of his Majesty, they unawares drive on the design again of some particular Faction, instead of the Publick Good, and so leave open a Gap still to Division. Thirdly, in case that the Scots come into this Kingdome againe, the Citizens ought to see very narrowly to the Principles of their ingage∣ing, ere they condescend to supply, or countenance them, secretly or openly. If they come in with the old cheat of Reformation, Covenant and Presbytery, it will be the wisdome of the Citie to consider, that this will be but a new On-set to the first designe of Scotish incroaching up∣on English Interest, and the maintaining of a Faction to serve the ends of Scotland, and the ambition of a few Scotified English, whose Aymes have been and are, to share Dominion with the Scots, to the disho∣nour and prejudice of the Nation, and the ruine of Monarchy, the alte∣ration of Church-government (how speciously soever set forth) being but a businesse subordinate to the private ends of particular Grandees among the Laity and obscure Rabbies of the Clergy. Fourthly, they may be pleased to observe, that the Game plaid hi∣therto betwixt the two Factions of Presbytery and Independency, hath been onely which of them should be our Riders; and its to be suppo∣sed now that all the strugling of the Presbyterians against the present ruling Grandees, is not by dismounting of them to free us, but onely to get themselves againe into the Saddle, that they may domineer o∣ver King and Kingdome, and then what comfort will the City or others
reap by all their paines and expences? Therefore it concerns the Ci∣tizens to looke well before they leape, and not to be deluded any longer with the stale pretences of a glorious Reformation; the end whereof is nothing else but oppression and confusion both of King and People. Fiftly, the Citizens may doe well to consider, what little benefit they are like to gaine unto themselves, in lieu of all that mischiefe that they will bring upon King and Kingdome, if the Presbyterian Faction shall prevaile againe. It may be it will somewhat tickle them for a time, to be revenged on the Independent party; and 'tis like they shall have their Members out of the Tower, and be put into the repossession of that and their Militia, so long as they imploy all to the behoofe and benefit of the Faction. But if the Presbyter-Citizens shall after a little time, upon the discovery of the Inconveniences brought upon the whole Kingdom, by the standing out against his Majesty, in point of Presbytery, begin once to grow discontented and weary of their new Masters, they may surely expect to be served the same measure that is now meted unto them by the Rulers of Independency; it being a Rule with all Ʋsurpers, no longer to countenance any that they have drawne into their Party, then they are willing to run on with them in Designe; but if once they begin to flag, to bury all their for∣mer merits in oblivion; also to reckon them as enemies, and use them accordingly. Sixthly, if they shall discover themselves so farre, as to ingage a∣gaine for Presbytery, let the Designe be attended with never so many pretences of loyalty towards the King and his Posterity, yet it being cleer notwithstanding, that such an Ingagement would be destructive to the Royall Interest, his Majesty and the Royall party can looke upon them no otherwise, then as absolutely disloyall, and resolved to con∣tinue their Rebellious courses. And then if it shall so happen (as probably it may) that there be a Complyance betwixt the Royall and Independent Party, the Doore will be in a manner bolted against any accommodation betwixt them and his Majestie; and then by the union of those two Powers before named, the Pillars of their Faction (both Scottish and English) being shken, and driven out of the KING∣DOME, They will remaine wholly at his MAJESTIES mercy, touching the forfeiture of their Charter and Priviledges, &c. and give him opportunity to bethinke himselfe of such wayes and meanes to quell their Pride, and such meanes as
may secure himself and his Successors from the rage of all turbulent and seditious humours in time to come. Seventhly, the Citizens ought to bestir themselves with such ala∣crity, and give such testimonies of their loyalty, as may serve to abate the career of our Independent Grandees, who will otherwise never be brought down to a compliance with his Majesty: and to this end, it will be their wisdom to pretend high toward an engaging any way, rather then endure them at this passe any longer; but still not∣withstanding to reserve within themselves a cordiall tender respect to the true interest of his Majesty: Moreover, if the case shall so stand, that an agreement be concluded betwixt his Majesty and the Indepen∣dents (which certainly will be happiest for this Nation, if it can possi∣bly be effected) then the Citizens ought not to let their spleens boil with the remembrance injuries received from this Faction; nor flatter themselves with imaginary benefits, which they suppose they might enjoy by advancing the other but lay aside all emulation and respect of faction on the one side or the other, and be ready to applaud any course, which his Majesty shall judge most convenient for the com∣posing of these unhappy differences. Lastly, since the restoring and selling of his Majesty is the onely way of true peace, then in case the Independents should continue obsti∣nate (to the last) against any agreement, it concerns all the honest and wise men of London, to be wary upon what terms they admit of a Scottish engagement, and not to be drawn in as they were formerly; but rather to observe the motions and directions of the royall party, and conform themselves wholly that way, as being the safest, ho∣nestest and most honourable, because free from faction and by-ends, and which hath for its sole end, the restitution of his Majesty and his royall Posterity, the preservation of the Church, and the establishment of true Religion, Peace and Liberty throughout his Majestes Realms and Dominions. V. Reasons drawn from the Interest of Scotland. The People of England being fully satisfied, that the design for al∣teration of Church-government, under pretence of Reformation, was first set on foot by the English and Scottish Grandees, meerly for am∣bitious, worldly ends and respects; and the Scots having had suffici∣ent experience of the stoutnesse of our English stomacks, that they will by no means digest the Presbyteriall government, and since it is
look't on by all knowing men, as absolutely inconsistent with, and destructive of Monarchy, without doubt it concernes the Scots to be∣thinke themselves of some other way wherby to settle an Interest and Inter-course with this Nation, than by introducing a Presbytery, where it is so extreamly distasted, by the generality of the People. That there is no way for the Scots to settle a beneficiall and last∣ing Interest here, but by an absolute and sincere Close with the Royall Interest, I shall manifest by severall Reasons: First, if they come in, and declare (in a mixed manner) for the King and the Covenant, they give the world to understand, that they come but to Act the old Cheat over again, seeing the Covenant (though there be words in it mentioning the Honour and happinesse of the King and his Posterity) would prove (in effect) the destruction of both: For if it works not an absolute change of Government in the State, as well as the Church; yet it is cleer, that it will regulate it into a po∣sture farre beneath the dignity and condition of a Monarchy. There∣fore upon such Termes, they will lose that assistance, which other∣wise they might have from the Royall Party in England. Secondly, by so declaring, they will draw the Curtaine now placed betwixt them and us, and give a perfect discovery of their Intenti∣ons; and we shall conclude, that their ayme is no wise at the good of his Majestie, but onely to serve their owne corrupt Interests. And we shall beleeve they bring in an Army for no other end, but to back their Party of Presbytery in the House and the City, so to crush the op∣posite Faction of Independencie, and then by removing the King to one of his Houses, reduce him and the Affaires of the Kingdome in Statu quo prius, as when he was at Holdenby; where he shall languish in the condition of a Prisoner, as long as he lives, or (at least) as long as they reigne; it being resolved on before hand, that he shall not be restored to the exercise of regall Power, till he have signed their Desires, and Propositions; which his Majestie hath so often declared to be against his Honour and Conscience. And then what may the Pres∣byters expect, but that the inraged People, having been so often de∣luded, and tyred in expectation of a Settlement, will take the first op∣portunity to rise all as one Man, to banish them and their Faction out of England, and upon their ruines restore both Prince and People, to their former Liberty? Thirdly, it seemes not to be the Resolution of the Covenant-A∣bettors onely in Scotland, but it is declared by that Party which pre∣tends highest for his Majestie in Scotland, and delivered in by them,
in their Answer to the Desires of the Kirke; That they resolve o to put into his Majesties hands, or any other, such power, whereby the Ends of the Covenant may be obstructed; but that his Majesty shall before any Ingagement, give assurance under Hand and Seale, for him∣selfe and Successors, to agree to certain Acts, injoyning the Cove∣nant, Presbbyterian Government, &c. and never to endeavour the change thereof. Which resolution of theirs gives us cause to suspect; that all the Bickerings heretofore between them and the Kirke, were but meer ventilations, acted on purpose to make the world beleeve some high Designe on foot there in the behalfe of his Majestie, and to feed the Royall Party with hopes of great matters from Scotland, that being held in suspence, they might remaine the lesse active, and give the Scots a more plausible and easie Ingresse into England. Fourthly, such a Resolution (if it once come to a publique Decla∣ration) will make men apt to beleeve, that under his Majesties name, those royall Pretenders doe Act some particular Interests likewise, ra∣ther then that of his Majestie and the Publique. And further, seeing Hamilton is the Chiefe among them, it cannot be judged very impro∣bable that He (who is a convicted Person, for aspiring to the Crown of Scotland, and who was so bold in the dayes of his Majesties pros∣perity, as to attempt it, and to that end (the better to compasse his Designe) had a hand in widening the distance betwixt his Majestie and the two Houses, and also in imbroyling the two Kingdomes) should take opportunity now in his Majesties lowest condition, and the present Division, to weave in his owne ambitious Interest, in hope to bring his Affaires unto perfection. I cannot accuse him; but if the Priestly Faction and his, doe close with each other upon Covenant considerations, it is a shrewd suspition: The agreement be∣twixt them (in plaine Termes) is this; That if HAMILTON serve the Presbyterian Designe in England, the Presbyters of both King∣domes shall (in requitall) connive at his doings, or assist him in his designe upon the Crowne of Scotland; and so his Majestie shall become a Sacrifice to the Covetousnesse and Pride of his malicious Adversaries. Fifthly, by an immediate and absolute Ingagement for his Maje∣stie, such jealousies as these will be quite taken away, and the hearts of the English so inclined and obliged to the Scots, that they will hezard both Lives and Estates in their assistance, and be willing by way of re-tribution, not onely to dis-burse toward the satisfaction
of their Arreares, but yeeld also, that his Majestie shall gratifie them with such other Rewards and speciall Indulgences of Grace and Favour in this Kingdome, as may tend highly to the Honour and Ad∣vantage of their Nation, even farre beyond what they may gaine by advancing their Presbyterian Interest; seeing it will be a long time ere the Kingdome can that way be stated, by reason of the contrary working humours, which will be ready to breake out ever and anon into new Insurrections; whereby the faction will be so continually bu∣sied at an excessive charge, and the People so impoverished, that they will not be more unwilling then unable to raise such vast sums, as are necessary for their satisfaction; at most, not the tithe of that pro∣portion which they may receive suddenly from the hands of the King, and with the love of the Kingdom. Sixtly, let not the Scots flatter themselves with a conceit of seeling their Presbytery amongst us, whether we will or no; for though they may do much by the strength of their faction, yet both English and Scots of that gang may consider, that the English are a va∣liant and generous people, impatient of the yoke; and though they may be beaten down for a time, yet if the Kingdom were divided into twenty parts, seeing (I am confident) at least nineteen of them are against Presbytery, it cannot be in reason imagined, that a few vo∣ting Punies, relying meerly upon Scottish Arms, should be able to trample down the spirits of this our magnanimous Nation for ever; but rather, that when they have smarted again under Presbyterian-tyranny for a time, they may recollect themselves with so much cou∣rage and successe, as will enable them to drive away the Scots and their faction, and confine the last seene of war within the limits of Scotland, where it had its Originall. Seventhly, though they may relie much upon a Party in the City, yet the Citizens eyes being well opened, to see that they have been made but stalking-horses to other mens private ends, and been gul'd out of so many millions, onely to purchase slavery unto themselves, dishonour unto their City, and destruction to their Trades, (which cannot be recovered again but by a setled peace) the Scots may guesse how little countenance or assistance they are like to obtain at their hands, except they so declare for his Majesty, as that they may receive assurance of his speedy restitution; without which, they are gene∣rally convinced, there can be no hope of Peace unto the Nation.
Lastly, if it should so happen, that the Scots play false with his Majesty, and drive both him and the Independent party to extremity, it is probable they may unite upon reasonable considerations, and mutuall compliance betwixt both their interests: and then that Party being for∣tified by an addition of the Royall, which (wheresoever it fides) brings in the affections of the whole Kingdom, it is very possible, the Scots may not onely be defeated in the hopes of that large Dominion, and those golden mountains which they promised unto themselves here, by an establishment of Presbytery; but also be forced to pack home again, without so much as one superstitious crosse, to requite them for the pains they have taken in the work of Reformation; and (per∣haps) draw revenge upon themselves, for all those affronts and in∣juries done unto his Majesty and the people of England, and renew the old antipathy with perpetuall enmity betwixt the Nations. From all which, give me leave to sum up this Conclusion in a word, that the Scots have no way to restore an Interest again in this Nation, but by waving the corrupt interest of Presbytery, and engaging abso∣lutely for the Royall Interest of his Majesty, as the onely means con∣ducing to the weal and benefit of both Kingdoms.
