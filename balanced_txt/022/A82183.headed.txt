WHEREIN Their Fidelity and true Affection to the publike good is cleary manifested, by their Voluntary Contributions, Personall Actions, and Strong Fortifications, for the safety of the King, Parliament and Kingdome.

A Declaration of the Loyalty of the Citizens of London to the KING and Parliament. MAny expressions of loyalty to a Prince from his subjects may be shewed, acceptable, but not profitable to the publick good, some aim∣ing at their owne particular preferment, and some to win his Prince his favour, this fidel∣lity is in these unfortunate times too frequent, this is loyalty without considerable premeditation, hurtfull and pernitious, this is exercised by temporary observances, the very Papists Enemies to the cause of Christ, may be indewed with this kinde of loyalty, but there is a loyalty which is unparal∣lelled, which the best and wisest men, which are not indewed with worldly, but spirituall wisdome, have rooted and fast fixed in their hearts, this loyalty is Duplex nay trip∣lex, and unremoveable, as Solomon, a threefold Cord is not easily broken, this hath its aspect fixed upon a triple object, upon their Prince, upon religion and upon law, upon their Prince as the head of that body of which they are members, and this loyalty is expressed in the indeavour to preserve both from Indemnity and dislocation or Fraction, for if either, both must needs languish and in the end perish by a
Consumption, the second is upon religion, this should be the primum mobile, the cheif mover and loadstone to draw the sincerest and heartiest affection therto, if this loyalty be wan∣ting which is called fidelity to God, in vaine can a Prince expect hearty affection from his people, if piety be not the ground of all their actions, all will come to naught and prove frustrate whether it be by Counsell, or externall ac∣tionate apparances: But here is not to be understood eve∣ry mans religion regulated by perticular fancy, for there is but one true religion grounded upon Devine Doctrine re∣corded in the sacred and Canonicall writings of the Old and new Testament; loyalty in religion must be constant & set∣led, not mutable: retain the truth and keep it, let not times alteration change our Religion, let not temporary division di∣vide the heart from his God and his verity. The third object is love, and this is Duplex, Divine and humane, upon the law of God, and Ordinance of man, the first is Devine obedience and loyalty, the other is politick fidelity, of the last I will most speake, because it is now the secondary cause of dissention, this is also twofold, grounded upon common and fundamentall lawes of this kingdome, and upon Parlia∣mentary goverment both knowne and of long continuance, the first unalterable, the last mutable according to the muta∣bility of times, both the only preservatives conjunctively, of kingdomes prosperity and tranquillity. If either fall or be destroyed, the totall frame of pollitick goverment must needs perish, for in this Consists the wel being of the whole nation, no surer ground of peace and happinesse, then the preserva∣tion of this ancient established goverment, the neglect of which breeds such ulcers and deep wounds in the body, that the cure must be so sharpe and bitter that the remedy seems to many worse then the disease, being tedious & weari∣some:
It happens just so in these times; the oppressions of the subjects of this kingdome by tyranicall courts arc now al∣most buried in oblivion, through the dilatory preventions of Malignant spirits, actors in the precedent tragedy of state oppression, whose power hath been and is so prevalent that they want not regall protection to defend their actions. Now then is the time to shew true loyalty to God, king and coun∣trey: now is the time to lay open the distinction of true and false obedience, now is the time if ever to shew who are true Patriots of the countrey, and who are perfidious betayers of the same to the will malice and tyrany of particular persons, Court favorites, and publick enemies to peace and piety. Having now to my weake abillity made distinction be∣tweene true loyalty and false, I will proceed to parallell the Actions of the worthy Cittizens of the City of London, to particulars before recited whereby it may be made manifest to the whole world, that their loyalty hath been singular and indefatigable, no trouble raised against them either in their persons or estates, hath changed their true loyalty no, thun∣der-bolt of Proclamations or Declarations against them can alter that fast grounded fidelity seated in their harts, although in this kinde they have had many discouragments if the same might have wrought upon there affections well versed in sacred writ, he that forsaketh father mother kindred freinds, lands, houses, goods, even all for the cause of God, shall re∣ceive an hundred fold in the day of their Accompts. The many contributions and dibursments that have been parted from by them, like continuall streames flowing with constancy, without intermission might have been ground suf∣ficient to have declined their fidelity, and the little benefit they have as yet received by the same, might have drowned their hopes of future happinesse, if they had not been truly
loyall to the King and parliament. But they are well read in Phisicall documents, concerning the health of materiall bodies similized to pollitick, contract∣ed and composed of a Commonwealth, that a long sicknesse must have long cure and a dangerous sore have a desperate medicine, and that if the same be applied and withdrawne before its operation, it may prove more dangerous and dead∣ly then the malady: Therefore the having well considered and pondered the premisses, count it no losse either of time or expence to wait Gods leasure for the redresse and curation of their evill, and lay no negligence or carelesnesse therein, upon the Parliament whose daily labours, dangers and vast distributions exceed any Parliament that ever sate in Eng∣land before, for the defence and maintainance of the publick good. No record of former ages can manifest the like loyalty. But to the shame of those times, the subject hath happened to forsake their Parliament in Ric. 2. and exposed both them, and themselves to the goverment of particular Parasites, and Herodian foxes, which proued destroyers of their countrey & Prince too at last: for it is received Maxime in State policy, he that is a traytor to himself can never be loyall to his king, and he that is a Traitout to his Country, is a traitour to him∣self, being a member and part of his Country. I now come to the loyalty of the Citizens of London, in their personall actions as well as in their purse-contributi∣ons, and in this respect the City may be called the Chamber or Store-house of true loyalty, a glasse wherein the whole Kingdome may see not onely the stamp or character of loy∣alty, but the substance it selfe. What City in England can compare with it, I mean not in respect of its largitude, but in respect of its alacrity and cheerfull performances of pub∣like
personall Offices tending to the common safety, the wil∣ling mind is discerned aswel in little as much, and the affecti∣on as really expressed; their industry so great, and operative actions so tractable, that it is meet to be recorded in tables of brasse, to be had in perpetuall memory, a pattern of constan∣cy to be imitated by all nations in the world. I am not able to expresse the worthinesse of their actions, conducing not not only to their own safeties and preservations, but to the benefit and profit of these whole Kingdome. Their extraordinary guards, by the heroick Companies of trained souldiers, daily exercised for the security both of Parliament and City is another demonstration of their true loyalty, maintained at their own charge, without being bur∣densome to the rest of the Kingdome, the activity of their spirits, complete habiliaments, may well render her to be the Lady and Queen of Cities, and glory to other nations, not equalized by the most famous cities of Europe, none or very few serving in this cause but the chiefest and best of the Citizens both for personage and estate, and so experien∣ced in their martiall discipline and exercises, that the mean∣est may be an Officer for his skill, in a Regall Army, the pat∣terne of magnanity and true valour, and what can more strengthen a King, and preserve the peace of his Kingdome, then true loyalty joyned with valour and courage in his people. No antiquity can record the like fortifications, bulwarks and trenches to have been about this city, as now are raised and made, for the strengthening and security thereof, who can testifie that former ages have produced such examples of loyalty; that even from the greatest to the least of the said City, from the highest to the meanest, have put their hand to the work, who can report of times past, that ever so many
thousand did daily work in their own persons, as now is seen, freely and with the work of their own hands, secure them∣selves by such out-works? who living can report that every day in the week in a warlike manner with their Commanders Colours, Drums and weapons of war in one hand, and in∣struments of labour in the orher, so many thousands should march to the work, as to a field of fight, imitating the Israe∣lites in the days of good Nehemiah, working with one hand, and upon the sound of the Drum, Arma parata, to fight with the other, and all this out of true loyalty to their King and Countrey, for the defence of the person and royall posteri∣ty of their Soveraigne, of the true religion grounded on the Word of God, of the Fundamentall and Parliamentary Lawes, and the Rights, Priviledges and Immunities of the free-born subjects of the English Nation. This is the triple object upon which the true loyalty of the Citizens of Lon∣don hath been hitherto, and yet is fast fixed and grounded: yet one mark more of their true fidelity (I had almost forgotten) worthy to be retained in perpetuall memory to succeeding ages, and that is, their searching out and rejection of the dis∣loyall hearted amongst them, and willingly exposing them to exemplary punishment for the same. There is no garden, be it never so decked with rare flowers and variety, but hath in it some weeds that must be plucked out and cast away, for the better growing of the serviceable and delectable flowers: no city that is free from evill members, that must be taken notice of, and either cropped or rooted out, least they over∣grow the good, and hinder their flourishing and increase. And thus I end, wishing the whole Kingdome in generall may i∣mitate this renowned City in its true loyalty and fidelity to God, their King and Countrey. FINIS.
