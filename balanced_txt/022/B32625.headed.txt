A PROPOSAL, Humbly offer'd to the Consideration of the Honourable the Commons of England in Parliament assembled, for raising a farther Supply towards the Erecting and Maintenance of the intended College or Hospital at Greenwich, for Ancient and Maimed Mariners and Sea-men; Or such other Good and Publick Use as the Honourable House shall think fit. THAT whereas by the Constitution and Establishment of, or some Grant to Christ's Hospital in London, the Governors thereof have Power to lett Leases, or dispose of Carooms, or Licenses and Dispensa∣tions for keeping and working for Hire, Cars and Carts, &c. within the said City and the Liberties thereof, As an Inheritance or Perpetuity belonging to the said Hospital; and no Person, who is not so qualified, can keep, or work for hire, any Car or Cart within the said City or Liberties: By virtue whereof, the Number of such Cars and Carts is setled at about 430, which is found a sufficient and convenient Number; Whereby many great Inconveniences are avoided: There being sufficient for all necessary Occasions, and yet not such an exorbitant Number as to clog up the Streets and obstruct the Passages, or cause the Owners to depend up∣on a Livelihood thereby, to the ruin of themselves and Families for want of a full Imploy: (As was the Case of many Hackny Coach-men, before their Number was limitted by Act of Parliament:) But on the contrary these Carooms, tho they cost the Owners 100 l. a piece at the least, upon taking the Lease, besides Office-Fees, and some yearly Rent or Acknowledgment to the Hospital, yet are they esteemed as valuable Chattels to be transferr'd, and as ready Money if offer'd to sale, (according to such Term and Interest as the Pro∣prietor has therein) as any other Leases whatsoever; and many Hundreds of Families are well supported thereby: And the Caroom (which is a Badg of Brass given by the Hospital, and born by the Car-man upon the String of his Car) denoting the Number of such Car, &c. gives them such a Reputation that they are readily intrusted with the Carriage of any Goods; there being a present Remedy against them in Case of any Misdemeanor, in such their Imployment. AND the City of Westminster and Liberties thereof, and Borough of Southwark, (without the Liberty of the City of London) and the several Out-Parishes in Middlesex and Surry, bordering upon the Liberties of the said Cities, and lying within the Extent of the weekly Bills of Mortality, being of late become very Populous, and likely still to Augment; And the greatest part of the Nobility and Gentry of the Kingdom living or resi∣ding therein, (especially during the Sessions of Parliament;) whose Coaches are many times not only ob∣structed, but even endamaged and broken, by over-numerous and disorderly Car-men and Carters, with their Cars and Carts, and that without any means of Reparation or Satisfaction from them; and the rather for that such Car-men and Carters, as live out of the Liberty of the said City of London, carry no Badg to denote their Place of abode, or where they may be found, and are without all Government and Restraint, as to their Number or otherwise; Whereby likewise Cheats and Frauds may the more easily be committed by them of the Goods with the Carriage whereof they are intrusted, And especially in the Case of Fires: And the ill-practice of some brings a Diseredit to the rest, to the great Hinderance of such there Imployment and Livelihood. AND therefore for preventing the several Inconveniences before mentioned, and raising some-what of a Supply for so excellent a Use as aforesaid, It is humbly proposed, That the Number of such Cars and Carts to reside and work for Hire, out of the Liberty of the said City of London, and within the Extent of the weekly Bills of Mortality, be restrain'd to 200, (or such other Number as shall be thought requisite) and Licenses granted of them from time to time for 21 Years, each to pay a Fine of 50 l. upon taking their first License, and such yearly Rent to the Hospital, during the Term, as shall be thought reasonable; And after the Ex∣piration of the Term, to pay such farther Fine, upon taking any new License, as shall be agreed upon with the Commissioners or Trustees to be appointed for the Management thereof, without any Abatement of the old Rent; And such Commissioners or Trustees to be impower'd by Act of Parliament to grant such Licenses, and make By-Laws for the well ordering and governing the Persons so to be Licensed, and to cause the same to be observed. AND forasmuch as divers Brewers, Inn-keepers, Wood-mongers, Cole-mongers, and Masters and Owners of Wharss, living within the said City and Liberties of Westminster, Borough of Southwark, and Out-Parishes aforesaid, keep and daily use divers Drays, Carts, and Carriages for carrying away their Dung, and for car∣rying out their Beer, Ale, Coles, Wood, Timber, Stones, Lime, and other their Goods and Merchandizes (ac∣cording to their respective Trades and Imployments) by whom, or their Servants, (for want of some good Orders and Rules of direction concerning them, and a ready way to detect and punish the Offenders) many Abuses and Disorders are frequently done and committed with such their Drays, Carts and Carriages, in the Streets and Passages where they pass, To the great Annoyance of divers of the Peers of England, and honou∣rable Members of Parliament, when going upon the weighty Affairs of the Nation, And to the frequent Abuse, and even hazard of the Lives of many other of his Majesties good Subjects, in passing about their Lawful Oc∣casions: THAT therefore, tho it may not seem reasonable to lay any Mulct upon the Persons aforesaid, for using such their Drays, &c. about their own Lawful Concerns and Imployments, Yet it may be requisite (for preventing Disorders and Abuses) to subject them likewise to the Orders and Government of the said Com∣missioners or Trustees so to be Constituted or Appointed as aforesaid; And to oblige the Owners or Occupiers of such Drays, Carts and Carriages, to carry a Badg or Ticket upon some apparent Place of every such Dray, Cart or Carriage, expressing the Name and Place of Abode of the Owner or Oecupier thereof; And to procure the same to be enter'd in the Office to be kept by the said Commissioners or Trustees for the Purposes afore∣said, And to be renewed so often as such Dray, Cart or Carriage, shall come to any new Owner or Occu∣pier, or that such Owner or Occupier shall have any new Habitation or Place of abode; They paying only a small Fee for the same. And the Fines and Forefeitures arising by Offences and Misdemeanors will be an Augmentation of the proposed Revenue, or help to defray the necessary Charge of the Management thereof. By P. C. and D. C.
