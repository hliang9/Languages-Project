❧ By the King. A PROCLAMATION For the Suppressing of disorderly and unseasonable Meetings, in Taverns and Tipling-houses, And also forbidding Footmen to wear Swords, or other Weapons, within London, Westminster, and their Liberties. CHARLES R. AS We cannot but hope that Our late Proclamation against Vitious, Debauched, and Prophane Persons, hath in a great measure attained those good ends and purposes, to which it was intended, So we cannot but take notice withal, that there are still some Persons, whose Licentious Appetites, are neither under the Command of any Reason, nor willing to be restrained by any Laws, Men that glory in their shame, and make this onely use of Virtuous Examples to deride them: Now (though We have made a firm and strict resolution with Our Self, never to give any the least Countenance or Imployment, to Men of such Inclinations; to the end that all Our Subjects, may at last perceive, that it will be their Interest, as well as their Religion, to be∣come Virtuous and Sober Persons; Yet) because such Methods as these, are not like to prove of so quick an operation as the infectious Manners of some Men do require; We do therefore hereby straitly Charge and Command All Our Subjects, of what Quality or De∣gree soever they be, That they presume not, contrary to the good Laws and Statutes made in the time of Our Royal Father, and Grand-father, to be Tipling in any Tavern, Victualling-house, Ale-hous, or other Tipling-house, nor to continue, or abide therein, after the hour of Nine of the Clock at night. And We do further Charge and Command All Keepers of Taverns, Ale-houses, Victualling-houses, and other Tipling-houses, That they presume not in any wise, to Receive, Harbour, or Permit any Person or Persons, to be so Tipling, or to continue in his or their houses, after the hour of Nine of the Clock at night, other then such Persons as are Lodgers in his or their respective houses, under pain of incurring the utmost Penalties, which by any Laws or Statutes of this Our Realm (those especially which have been made in the Time of Our Royal Father or Grand father) can or may be inflicted upon such Persons as shall be found there, and such Masters of houses as shall suffer them to abide there, together with such other Fines and Penalties, as upon the Centemners of this Our Royal Will and Pleasure, shall be thought fit to be further lawfully imposed. And We do further Charge and Command All Mayors, Bayliffs, Sheriffs, Iustices of Peace, Constables, and other Officers, to take strict care that this Our Proclamation be duly Obeyed, and to enter into any Tavern, Ale-house, or other Tipling-house, to search for such disorderly Persons as shall be found there Tipling contrary to the said Laws, or that shall abide there after the hour of Nine of the Clock, in contempt of Our Laws, and this Our Proclamation, and to Levy the Pe∣nalties, and cause the Offenders, together with the Master or Mistress of such respective house where they shall be found, to come before the next Iustice of Peace, who is hereby required to cause all and every the Persons so brought before him, to enter into Bond for their Appearance at the next Sessi∣ons of Peace to be held within their respective Limits, and then, and there, to answer such matters as shall be objected against them on Our behalf. And to the end that no inferiour Officers, or Ministers of Justice, may be any ways discouraged, in their diligent and vigorous Prosecution of these Our Commands; We do hereby Publish and Declare, That if any Our Officers aforesaid, shall be resisted in the execution of this his Charge, or any ways affronted or abused, We shall look upon it as a Contempt of Our own Person and Authority, and cause it to be Prosecuted and Vindicated accordingly. And forasmuch as Mischiefs have frequently hapned, and are likely to Ensue, by Pages, Footmen and Lacquies Wearing Swords and Weapons; For prevention thereof for the future, We do hereby Prohibit all Pages, Footmen, and Laquies, from carrying or using Swords or other Weapons with∣in the Cities of London and Westminster, or the Liberties thereof, at their perils, and upon pain of Our Displeasure, and the utmost punishment, which by Law can be inflicted upon them. And We do here∣by strictly Charge and Command All Masters of such Pages, Footmen, and Lacquies, That they suffer them not to wear, or use any Sword, or other Weapons, within the Places aforesaid, contrary to the Tenor of this Our Royal Proclamation in that behalf. Given at Our Court at Whitehall the Twenty ninth day of September, in the Twelfth year of Our Reign. God save the King.
