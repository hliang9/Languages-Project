A LETTER TO A GENTLEMAN ABOUT THE Election of Members For the COUNTY of CAMBRIDG, To serve in this present PARLIAMENT; With some Reflections upon a late Libellous Paper Entituled, A Letter to a Friend upon the Dissolving of the late Parliament, and the calling of a new One; together with a List of those who were against making the Prince and Princess of Orange King and Queen. Which Reflections are made to warn all their Majesties good Subjects, on this Occasion, of the Malice and Scandal of the said Libel. SIR, YOU Have already received an Account of the Election of Members to serve in this present Parliament, for the County, University, and Town of Cambridge; but were not therein acquainted with that rest∣less Spirit of Malice, and Sedition, which will be satisfied with nothing less, than the ruin of the Government in Church and State, and the Introduction of Popery, and Arbitary Power among us; As plainly appeared by the Dis∣senters adhering to, and approbation of the practices of the last Reign, in or∣der thereunto; And particularly in this County, relating to the election there lately made; towards the effecting of whose foremention'd designs; they dis∣persed that Scandalous and Libellous paper, Entitled, A Letter to a Friend &c. to this County, University, and Town of Cambridg; as they have done in all other parts of England, to prevent the honest Free-Holders and Mem∣bers of the several Corporations of England, from giving their Votes for any of those Worthy Patriots of our Church, and State, Printed in the said Scandalous Paper; And for the more effectual obtaining this their Malicious Design; they in this County spread the Venom thereof in their CON∣VENTICLES, using Vile, False, and Scandalous Reflections upon some of the said persons therein named; which coming to the knowledg of the Magistrates of the University, and Town of Cambridg, they upon strict enquiry into the matter of the said Libellous Letter, caused the following Paper to be printed and dispers'd thro' the whole County, that by this example other places might be warned against this Poysonous and Infectious Libel. The true Copy of which Paper is the following.
WHEREAS a False and Scandalous Libel hath been Printed and Dispers'd abroad against several Gentlemen of Worth and Quality, and of known Affection to the present Government; and in particular against Sir Levinus Bennet Baronet, and Sir Robert Cotton Knight, two of their Majesties Justices of the Peace of this County of Cambridg; Suggesting that they were against King William's and Queen Mary's, being King and Queen, thereby Insinuating, that they are disaffected to the present Government; which Suggestions are altogether False and Malitious. The aforesaid Gentlemen having alwaies, and in multitudes of Instances signaliz'd their affection both to the King and Queen, as likewise to the Protestant Religion; and to the end such False and Malicious Scandals and the spreders thereof may be brought to Con∣digne Punishment: It is desired by those Gentlemen, that all good men will make discovery to some Magistrate of all such Persons who shall be Instruments in Spreading and Publishing of such False and Scandalous Reflections. Imprimatur, James Johnson, Vice-Chancellour, John Pepys, Mayor. I must likewise further crave leave to tell you, That the Forementioned Paper had so good an Effect upon the Free-Holders of this County, as like∣wise upon the Members of the University and Town of Cambridg, that they have Chosen for their Representatives in Parliament, Men of Honest and Moderate Principles; Firm to the Establish'd Government in Church and State; whom we doubt not, but will upon all Occasions approve themselves steady and Zealous for the Wellfare and True Interest of both. I cannot therefore but much dislike the Example of the Author of that Malitious Libel, who durst have the Confidence to invade the Previledg of Parliaments, in Publishing the names of their Members, which is notoriously done in the foremention'd Paper; for which Reasons I have carefully forborne the mentioning of the Names of those, who would have given up all the Cor∣porations of England to the Regulators of the late Reign, who consisted cheifly in many places of Papists, as well as Disenters, and others, who were for giving up the Penal Laws and Test. Those GREAT BULWORKS OF OUR SPIRITUAL AND CIVIL RIGHTS. Nor must it be omitted, how much the Grace and Goodness of the King was abused, who did not only intend an Indemnity and Pardon to all his Subjects, at his Accession to the Crown, in imitation of all his Roy∣al Predicessors; who did the like; but for the more effectual Grant of the same, did out of his abundant Grace to his People, and for quieting their Minds, leave it to the Parliament to frame the same for the greatest Se∣curity and Advantage that could be contrived; which those Men were so far from prosecuting, That notwithstanding all the Endeavours made by those worthy Patriots of our Country (Aspersed by the forementioned Li∣bel) to answer the King's most just Desires, these irreconcileable Spirits would never suffer it to pass; thereby making the Government grievious, and hazarding its Destruction, that so they might more easily make that Change, or a worse, which they falsely and maliciously impute to the honest and well affected People of this Nation.
