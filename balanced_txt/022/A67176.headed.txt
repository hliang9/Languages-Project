CORDA ANGLIAE: OR, THE GENERALL EXPRESSIONS OF THE LAND: Moving XXV. Particulars to the Honourable Assembly in the High Court of Parliament. THAT THE CHVRCH of England may become a glorious Church of GOD. Printed in the yeare 1641.
To the High and Honourable Assembly in the upper and lower House of Parliament. Most noble Senatours: WHereas many petitions are daily presented before your Honours, some in the behalf of their friends, others also for themselves, and all for succour and re∣leefe; their causes are heard in your ho∣nourable Assembly, treated on, and accor∣ding to the truth of the cause so is it re∣leeved. Amongst the rest, may it please your high and honourable Court to deeme a favourable eye on my petition also, put up, not in the behalfe of my owne particu∣lar, nor of one or two friends alone, but
in the behalfe of the whole Church: and whatsoever in it your honourable Assem∣bly conceives not fit to grant, let it be ab∣ortive. Vouchsafe it, most noble Senators, but an eye in her behalfe, and as your Ho∣nours finde that she hath beene abused, so releeve her. But because from the highest Cedars to the lowest Lilie in the Church of Christ, all are confident in your procee∣dings, rejoycing in your high and honou∣rable Assembly, before whom I tender my cause, and with the whole Church depend on God and you for a tryall: till when, we pray for heavenly wisedome to direct you; and now, and then, and ever, the grace, peace, love, and comfort of the Trinitie to abide with you. Your poore petitioner in the behalfe of a distressed Church, Hen: Walker:

That the government of the Church be no more wholly left to Bishops im∣pious government, to bring such scandall as it hath done to Religion; but that there may be lay Elders, ac∣cording to the Primitive Churches; or some other government under the Kings Majesty (as the Honourable Assembly shall thinke meet) to assist the Clergy in Ecclesiasticall matters, that so the Clergy bee not taken off from their Pulpits, as they have been, to the great misery of many Congre∣gations under them. And that all Pa∣stors may therefore hereafter perform their office of preaching, as they ought to doe, to the peoples edification, and comfort, feeding the flock of Christ.

IV. That the Bishops bee henceforth preaching Ministers, and not any more lifted up to such lordly hierar∣chy as they have beene heretofore: that they may bee wholly taken off from temporall matters, and reduced onely to the ministery of the Word, the Sacraments, and Prayer, and such like offices of the ministeriall functi∣on, as are warrantable, and according to the word of God.

Such men (saith the Father) when you see them, you may rather judge them bridegroomes, or wooers, then Priests, or men of the Clergy. VI. That no Minister whatsoever, may bee suffered to teach or preach any doctrine grounded onely upon the bare opinions of men, except he can also prove it so to be ap∣parently evident by the word of God. And that neither the Minister nor people may be
oppressed with the observance of such tra∣ditions of men, which are repugnant to the word of God. Socrat. eccl. hist. lib. 2. cap. 38. Io∣seph. ant. lib. 20. cap. 2. Euseb. lib. 5 cap. 11.

VII. That there be no such disorderly and in∣terrupted kinde of praying, as is used in the Church Liturgy, but that the Pastor or Mi∣nister only pray aloud in a decent and order∣ly manner to the peoples capacity, as the mouth of the Congregation, not being in∣terrupted, the people silently joyning with him, that so they may pray in spirit and in truth together, and that thereby their affe∣ctions may be the more elevated, assenting thereto with the word Amen, or the like ex∣pression, without disturbance, as the custome is, when the Minister prayes one thing, the people they interrupt him, and pray for something else, who should rather give their assent to that which the Pastor or Minister prayeth for, with Amen, or the like expression.

VIII. That the Ministers of Christ may not be compelled to supertitious bowings, or to wearing of the Surplesse, Tippet, &c. or to observe any other superstitious ceremony, which Iesus Christ never imposed upon them. And that there be no Courts allow∣ed to have power to binde mens conscien∣ces to the observance of such things as are not onely not manifest in Gods word, but contrary to the same, which hath beene a great burden to the Church of God.

IX. That the faithfull and painfull Ministers of the word of God may bee reverently re∣spected, and that the people doe diligently heare and attend them, and bee not suffered in any wise to scandalize them, nor have po∣wer to depose them, or put them out, whom
before they made choice of by a free con∣sent, except upon just cause, and such proofe as shall apparently manifest that they are such as ought to bee deprived by the word of God, but otherwise to respect them as such who have the charge, and are the overseers of their soules.

That the oath ex officio be so overthrown that it may never rise againe to exact, as it hath done, in the Prelates Courts, extorting upon mens concealed thoughts, molesting innocent causes, by secret suggestions: and that all Courts shall henceforth proceed a∣gainst onely such crimes as are evident to be sins by the word of God, and made mani∣fest either by the confession of the party him∣selfe without an oath, or the witnesse of ho∣nest and sufficient testimony by an oath: And that every person accused, shall bee heard without partiality, or injustice, to speake freely what hee can for himselfe,

That no Ecclesiasticall officer may pro∣ceed to penance, or excommunicate any of∣fender for his crime, after he shall freely ac∣knowledge the same, by professing hearty repentance if the crime be private, or a pub∣like acknowledgement and confession, with protestation of penitency, if the offence bee notorious, it being the office of the civill Magistrate to doe the rest. Yet if such of∣fenders be obstinate, and will not be per∣swaded to penitency, he who shall so con∣tinue an heretick, may be excommunicated, yet not without the consent of the whole Congregation, in the publike assembly, and then to leave them to God, and the further punishment of the civill Magistrate: yet to
labour in the tender bowels of mercy, to bring them into the Church againe by re∣pentance, and not to suffer (if it be possible) the weake brethren to perish. Imp. hist. 99. Iustin▪ Apol. 2.

XIII. That no part of the Apocrypha bee ap∣pointed to be read in the Church Liturgy, as it useth to be, notwithstanding many chap∣ters
in the canonicall Scriptures which are never read: that therefore onely the Cano∣nicall Scriptures may be reade in Churches. And moreover that it be so ordered, that the whole Canonical Scriptures may be appoin∣ted to bee read through once every yeare, if not expounded also. In the third Councell of Carthag. canon. 47.

That the people may not bee constrained in the Sacrament to any particular gesture, That the people may not bee constrained in the Sacrament to any particular gesture, or outward Ceremony, nor meet with such disturbance as some have done at that very time, about outward superstition, and vaine trifles. That all such who being in the Church, come to the Sacrament prepared, may be admitted without disturbance. And that the Ministers may bee restrained from that vaine adoration of the Sacrament, by bowing, which many use, to the great dis∣honour of Almighty God, making an idoll of the bread and wine, given to us for a sa∣crament ordained by Christ, not to be ado∣red
as a God, or idoll, but used as a sacra∣ment. And that the Communion Table may never any more be altered, or called an altar, or set up otherwise, but stand as a Table in the Church, according to Christs institution. And that the Crosse in Baptisme be no more tyed to the Church, nor any such like Popish Ceremonies or circumstances, as the childe promising and answering in the godfathers and godmothers, in it selfe as it were, as if the Ghost of the childe had at that time being in them.

Saint Au∣stin in his epistle to Bonifacius, 23. Ep. We say, saith he, on Easter day, this day Christ rose from death, death, whereas we know that it was many hundred yeares since that he arose from death, yet wee doe not herein speake lyes when wee so speake, because every one knowes that we call the day so, by a simili∣tude to the day wherein the thing was done, which by the course of the yeare is a like day: so wee say such things were done this day, or that day, for the celebration of the Sacraments, when as we know both the day and the thing it selfe was long since. Was Christ offered any more but once, and he offered himselfe, so that the outward things in the Sa∣crament are not very Christ, but the sacrament or similitude of his death, &c. XV. That all Crucifixes, Candles, Tapers, and Images bee removed out of our Churches, and all Idolatry, and such like vaine worship,
that so the Church of England may become so glorious a Church, when she shall be void of all Popish shadowes and ceremonies, using no other expressions or jestures of the body, save onely such whereby the body ex∣presseth that which is in the minde.

It is lamentable to consider the lying fables and tales which the Iesuites make the simple people be∣leeve of Crucifixes, and Candles, &c. amongst the rest, how abomina∣ble is that fable which they declare and tell the people, of a wicked fellow who never did any good deeed in all his life, save onely once he offered a Candle to the Virgin Mary, for which, as their lying fable saith, when he was in hell afterwards, hee cryed to the Virgin Mary to helpe him, and she hearing of him, returned him his Candle againe, with the which he fought with the Devils, and drove them all away, and rid himselfe of them. &c. XVI. That such who are studious in Divinity, and have not received (as yet) the orders of the Ministery, (holding no heresie, nor schismaticall doctrine, but such as is sound and orthodox, and have a good report) may be suffered to preach before a Congregation, for the tryall and exercise of their abilities, to the great satisfaction and proofe on either part: albeit they exercise or meddle not with
any other part of action of the ministeriall function, save onely praying and preach∣ing, untill such time they shall bee received into orders. Councell of Toledo, ca∣non 52. Iren.

This would be a meanes to keepe many unable Schollers (who are very unfit for the Ministery) out, that such as bee received into orders, may be knowne to bee able to divide the Word aright. XVII. That every allowed Pastor and Minister of Gods word may have sufficient mainte∣nance setled upon them, in such a forme as none can deprive them of it, neither in part, nor in whole, or at any time force them to sue for it, and so bee interrupted from their studies and Pulpits to follow the Law, but that they may have it so setled upon them, that they may receive it without trouble; and that all such of them who dying shall leave behinde them wife or children of honest and good report, may (in case they should want) be provided for.

XIX. That some course be taken for the poore, other then that hath been, whereby in many places and parishes the Churchwardens have by sacriledge spent that upon them∣selves, which did belong to the poore of the Church, and converted it to great benefit for themselves, whilest the poore have had ve∣ry little of it, or benefit by it; they have made themselves richer, by making the Church-treasury poorer.

These Romish trumpery (saith he) never brought good into England. XXIII. That all Popish bookes, hereticall, and schismaticall bookes, all unjust and scanda∣lous pamphlets, which by due examinati∣on are found so to be; all vaine and ungodly bookes, ballads, love-songs, and lascivious bookes, and vaine pamphlets, may be cal∣led in, and no more such may be ever tole∣rated hereafter, or dispersed either in print, or in manuscript; which vaine bookes, bal∣lads, and pamphlets, have taken deeper im∣pression upon the hearts of many thousands,
