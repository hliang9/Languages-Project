A New SONG on the Arrival of PRINCE GEORGE, And His Intermarriage with the LADY ANN. To the Tune of, Old Jemmy. I. PRince GEORGE at last is come, Fill every man his Bumper; For the Valiant DANE make room, Confusion to each Rumper. And every prodigal starch'd Fool Aspires unto a Crown, By hopes of Plotting Knaves to Rule, Who next wou'd pull him down. II. Preserve Great CHARLES our King, And His Illustrious BROTHER, Whilst Whigs in Halter swing. And hang up one another: The joyful Bridegroom and the Bride, Prince GEORGE of Royal Race, Of all the Swains the Joy and Pride, The subject of their Lays. III. Brave GEORGE He is a Lad With all Perfections shining; With every Virtue clad, And every Grace refining: But oh! of such a war-like Race, So Conqu'ring are His Charms, No Mars in Field, but must give place To His Victorious Arms. IV. Brave GEORGE, Great Denmark's Son (A stout and war-like Nation) By Birth to ENGLAND's Crown A near and dear Relation; But now the Knot is doubly ty'd, Which makes Him still more near, The Knot which Knaves would have destroy'd, By cutting off the Heir. V. But now the Tribe's dispers'd, Their Projects are defeated, Which Walcot and the rest Did hope to have compleated: And now they'l pay for all their scores, Who for that Int'rest stood, And let 'em hang for Sons of Whores, Who thirst for ROYAL BLOOD. VI. Poor Perkin! where's the hope Of all thy high promoting? No, Bully Tom▪ a Rope Must crown thy Cheats and Plotting: Let Ferguson with Gray escape, They safe are ev'ry-where, If Murder, Treason, Lust and Rape Can pass unpunish'd here. VII. Let M—th for a Crown, That hopeful Prince so Loyal, Away with Rebels run, To raise an Army Royal: Brave George for England scorns to fly, Old Jemmy stout as He, Their Plots and Malice we defie, And all their Treachery. VIII. Nay Heav'n, which Him did raise O'th' Protestant Profession, In His Immortal Race Maintain the iust Succession, hat no pretending Bastard bold, In time to come, may dare His lawless Title to uphold, Against the lawful Heir. Printed by Nath. Thompson, at the Entrance into the Old-Spring-Garden, 1683.
