To the PARLIAMENT of the COMMON∣VVEALTH of England, Scotland, and Ireland, assembled at Westminster. The humble Petition of Humphrey Bagaley Sheweth, THat your Petitioner, having bin by a party of Horse taken out of Bed the 21th of May last, and deliver∣ed to a Company of Foot at St. James; and from thence carried to the Tower, where he was cast into a Prison-lodging commonly called Nunns Bower, or The Hole, until he had submitted to pay an arbitrary Fyne, hath ever since continued a Prisoner, though not at al brought before any Officer Millitary or Civill to be examined. Al which, as he really beleives it to be unknown to this honou∣rable House; so is he not ignorant, that it is against Magna Charta, the Petition of Right, and the sixth Article of the present Government. And therefore being conscious to him∣self, that he hath not in any manner transgrest against any Law of the Land or the present Government, Humbly prays, He may be referred to a speedy legall tryall, which is it he above all things desires, to the end his innocency may be manifested to the World. Or otherwise to release him with such consi∣deration for the heavy charge and exspence be hath thereby bin exposed to, as unto Equity and Justice doth appertein. And, as in duty bound, Your Petitioner shall pray, &c.
