ARTHVR Lord CAPELL Lieutenant Generall under the Prince His Highnesse of His Majesties Forces, in the Counties of VVorcester, Salop, and Chester, and the sixt Northern Counties of VVales. To all Commanders, Officers, and Souldiers, and to all other His MAJESTIES Subjects whatsoever, whom these presents shall or may in anywise concern. WHereas the Kings most Excellent Majestie, having a tender Regard and graci∣ous Care of the preservation of the Goods and Estates of his loving and well-affected Subjects, hath, by two severall Proclamations, the one of the fift of November last, the other of the seventeenth of March last, inhibited all His Majesties Commanders, Officers, and Souldiers of His Armies to commit any Spoyle, Robbery, Plunder or Pillage upon any His Majesties Sub∣jects, or their Goods, with direction for a strict and severe proceeding against the Offenders by the Law Martiall, Notwithstanding which His Majesties gracious and tender Provision for His People, complaints have been made to me of some Outrages, and Plunders committed by some Souldiers in His Majesties Service since the said Proclamations, and before my coming in∣to these Counties and Parts within the Command abovesaid, which occasioneth much Fear and Doubt in His Majesties well-affected People in these Counties and Parts, and may become exceedingly disadvantagi∣ous to the present Service: I hereby signifie and Declare, That if any Officer, of what Degree or Quality soever, or any Souldier under their Commands, within the Counties abovesaid, shall at any time hereafter wilfully do, or permit, or countenance to be done any Spoyle, Robberie, Plunder or Pillage upon any the Persons, Goods, Horses, Cattell, or Provisions of Corn, Hay, or Victuall of His Majesties Subjects in the said Counties, contrary to His Majesties said Proclamations, That I shall undoubtedly, upon Complaint ex∣hibited, and due proof thereof to me made, proceed strictly, according to the exact Tenor of His Majesties said Proclamations, and according to the latitude of my own Commission from His Majestie, agreeable with the Discipline of Warre, severely to punish the Offenders, and every of them. And whereas there are divers Persons within the Counties and Parts abovesaid, notoriously known to be disaffected to His Majestie, his righteous Cause, and his present Service, whose Estates are obnoxious and lyable to Seizure and Confiscation; These are to signifie and declare, That when and as often as any such seizure shall be made, the same shall not otherwise be done but by particular Warrant and Direction of His Majestie, or such who shall have the immediate Command in Chief of the Forces of these Counties and Parts: And that due care shall be had and taken for the punctuall Inventorying and valuable Apprizing of such Moneys, Goods, Cattell, or other Estate which shall be so seized, to the end that Accompt may be given thereof to His Majestie; And that the Party and Parties, Owners thereof, in case they shall acquit themselves of the Crimes to their Charges laid, may have a fitting Recompence and Restorement. And I do hereby further signifie and declare, That all such ready Moneys, and Moneys to be raised by disposall of any Goods or Cattell so at any time from such known Disaffected Persons to be seized, shall be disposed wholly and as thriftily as may be in His Majesties present Service, for defence of the said Counties and Parts, and as much as in me lyeth, for the ease of the Burthen and Charge which may otherwise fall up∣on those His Majesties good Subjects, who have readily, and in good proportion exprest their affections to the Cause and Service. Hereby Willing, and straitly Charging and Commanding, That no Officers or Soul∣diers presume to intermeddle with any estate of any man under the Notion or Reputation of a Malignant, without my speciall Warrant and Authority, him or them thereunto enabling. And I do further direct and require all Officers under my Command, That this my Command be publish∣ed in all the Quarters within the said Counties and Parts wherein His Majesties Commanders and Souldiers are, or hereafter shall happen to be Quartered, by the sounding of Trumpets and beating of Drumms for the monition of Officers and Souldiers in their duties. And that care be taken that the same may be likewise pub∣lished in all Churches and Chappells within these Counties and Parts abovesaid, for the satisfaction of His Majesties good and well-affected Subjects. Given under my Hand and Seale at Arms this Third day of Aprill. 1643. ARTHVR CAPELL. ❧ Imprinted at Shrewsbury by ROBERT BARKER, Printer to the Kings most Excellent Mastie▪ And by the Assignes of OHN BILL. 1643.
