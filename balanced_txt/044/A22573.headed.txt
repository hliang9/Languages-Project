❧ By the King. His Maiesties Proclamation restraining the abuses in Gold VVeights fraudulently committed con∣trary to a former. WHere Our Soueraigne Lord the King by Proclamation giuen at the Court at White Hall the Twentieth Day of December, in the Eighth yeere of His Maiesties Reigne: for reformation of great abuses in the Counterpoises and Weights of His money of Gold, and Graines and halfe Graines to bee vsed in poysing of them, did publish and declare that the Weights wherewith his Maiesties money of Gold should bee poised after the sixe and Twentieth day of Ianuary then next ensuing, should bee made of a round and Cir∣cular forme, wherein should bee inscribed certaine markes that they might easily be knowne from Weights formerly vsed, which should be of the full and iust size according to the true Weights of the Gold moneys, and the Graines and halfe Graines should bee apart by them∣seiues to shew the remedies and abatements as they ought to bee, and none of them should bee made with the remedies and batements purposely taken off, (commonly called Blancke-Weights;) And for the better effecting of His Maiesties pleasure, His Maiestie did commit the care of Making and Assizing of those Counterpoyses and weights to Sir Thomas Aylesbury, Baronet, one of the Masters of Request, whom his Maiestie commanded to haue in readinesse in the Lowre of London, sufficient numbers of the said Weights, Graines, and halfe Graines, with
iust and equall Beames and Ballances for the vse of them, exactly and diligently made and sized to furnish His Subiects by the said sixe and twentieth day of Ianuary, to bee issued at reasonable prizes; And His Maiesties will and Pleasure was, that the Chiefe Officers, in all Cities, Bo∣roughs and Townes Corporate, with all Conuenient speede, should prouide one paire of the said Weights and Ballances, sufficient, at the hands of the said Sir Thomas Aylesbury, or such as hee should appoint to deliuer the same, made according to the fashion aforesaid, within euery such City, Borough and Towne Corporate; well and safely to be kept, that such as would, might haue recourse and accesse vnto them, for discerning of the true weights of His Maiesties Moneys of Gold, whereof receipts or payments should bee, as occasion should require; And his Maiestie did straightly Inhibite all His Subiects, and others whatsoeuer within His Dominions, after the said sixe and twentieth day of Ianuary, to haue, or vse any o∣ther weights, of, or for the Coynes of Gold, and remedies thereof, then onely such as should be made circular, and sized and issued by the appointment of the said Sir Thomas Aylesbury. And that no person, or persons, of what estate, degree, or condition soeuer they were or should be, should at any time then after presume to make, cast, contriue, frame or cause to be made any Counterpoyses, or Weights, Graines or halfe Graines, or any Toole or Instrument, Presse, Mill, Stampes, Punchions, Counterpunchions, or any thing else whatsoeuer, for the making, casting, framing or preparing of such weights, or vent, or import the same made, o∣ther then the said Sir Thomas Aylesbury, or such as should bee thereunto appointed by his Maiestie, vpon paine of His Maiesties High Indignation and displeasure, and such other paines and penalties, as by the Lawes and Statutes of His Maiesties Realme, or by His Maiesties Prerogatiue Royall, could or might bee inflicted vpon contemners of His Maiesties Proclamations and Royall Commands; And it was His Maiesties pleasure, that in receits and payments of His Maiesties moneys of Gold, none should bee compelled to trie the Weight thereof by other Poyses or Weights then those that should bee made of a forme circular, as is before set foorth; Sithence which time some euill disposed persons, without the assent, and against the will of the said Sir Thomas Aylesbury haue presumed to make diuers Counterpoyses and Weights of His Maiesties Moneys of Gold, and Graines, and halfe Graines for poysing thereof, which were vnequall and defectiue, which were endeauoured to bee put to sale, which being discouered by the care of the said Sir Thomas Aylesbury, according to dutie, and in discharge of the trust reposed in him, hee made the same knowne to the Lords of His Maiesties Priuie Counsell: and thereupon those false Counterpoises, Weights, Graines and halfe Graines were seised vpon, and being found defectiue, are by command melted downe, whereby a great inconuenience which might otherwise happen to His Maiesties people is preuented: And some of the Delinquents haue for that attempt beene chastised:
Our said Soueraigne Lord the King of His great and abundant care that His Iustice, both in His Courts and Commerce amongst His people bee duely administred and obserued, and that His people bee not deceiued with false Weights, which are abominable: by the aduice of His Priuie Counsell, doth againe straightly Inhibite all His Subiects, that none of them doe make, forme, or offer to put to sale any Counterpoyses or Weights of the moneys of Gold, or Graines, or halfe Graines to be vsed in poysing thereof, but the said Sir Thomas Aylesbury, or such as first shall haue Licence from the said Sir Thomas Aylesbury, to vent the same; And doeth also by these presents, straightly inhibite all His Subiects and others whatsoe∣uer within His Dominions, to haue, or vse publikely, or priuately in shoppes or else-where any other Weights of or for the Coynes of Gold and remedies thereof, then onely such as shall bee made circular and sised, and issued by the appointment of the said Sir Thomas Aylesbury: And doth likewise charge the said Sir Thomas Aylesbury, that hee shall imploy none in making, venting, or issuing of any such Counterpoyses, Weights, Graines or halfe Graines, but in such manner as in the said former Proclamation is specified: Letting all men know, His Maiestie intends with all seueritie to proceed against all such as shall contemne, or not yeeld obedience to this and His said former Proclamation. Giuen at the Court at Greenewich this fist day of May, in the tenth yeere of the Reigne of Our Soueraigne Lord CHARLES, by the grace of God King of ENGLAND, SCOTLAND, FRANCE, and IRELAND, Defen∣der of the Faith, &c. God saue the King. ❧ Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most Excellent Maiestie: and by the Assignes of Iohn Bill. 1634.
