A myste∣rye of inyquyte contayned within the heretycall Genea∣logye of Ponce Pantolabus / is here both dysclosed & confu∣ted By Iohan Bale. An. M.D.xlii. ¶Marke in the capytall let∣ters of this boke / the. A. B. C. with the name of the Author. I wyll shewe the (sayth ye An¦gell to Iohan) the mysterye of the greate whore / & of ye Beast that beareth her. Apoca. 17. ☜Emprynted at Geneua. By Mychael Woode. 1545.
The Preface. EVydent is yt (dere frynde in the Lorde) vnto them which are in the scripturs exercysed / that our eternall God for his owne lye honoure created man at the first / and all other creaturs for mannys behoue. This ones conceyued by fayth in Abell and Enos / at the preachynges of Adam & Seth for the first age / prouoked the one to offre vp sacrifice vnto hi / & the other to call vpon his most gloryouse name. In this godlye offyce was Noe founde ryghtouse / Abraham sayth full / Moses myghtye / Dauid holye / Helias feruent / and manye other more in their sor∣tes zelouse for all the other ages. Farre to longe were yt and tedyouse vnto the readers to recyte the examples of all the fathers in that behalfe. Iesus Christ the onlye fulfyl∣ler of all ryghtousnesse / in all his sore trauay le here / sought the onlye glorye of his heauē¦lye father / and taught the same lesson aboue all other to be obserued of his. In the many∣folde temptacions of sathan in the wilder∣nesse he paciētlye answered to that was sug¦gested / but the presumed dishonour of God in no case coulde he suffre. The holye Apo∣stles and manye other Godlye mynysters / haue euermore daungered their syues in the lust quarell of the same. If we than wetyng∣ly shuld suffre him in this age to be blasphe¦med / all these godlye exāples reiected / we myght thereby rather apere his enemyes /
than seruauntes / his haters than louers. This consyderacion first moued my mynde / after that I had seane a thre years ago / an abhomynable Iest made vndre the tyttle of a Genealogye of heresye / & by two diuerse prentes spred abrode amonge the people / to dysclose the great mysterye of iniquyte ther∣vndre contayned / and to restore agayne the peruerted scripturs / with the names of tho∣se Godlye menne which are oblocuted ther∣in. In this will no man that is godlye be of∣fended / but thynke that I haue herin done my bounde dewtye. Though the compylet therof by the mercyfull Goodnesse of God be conuerted to repentaunce (as I am cre∣dyblye infourmed that he is) yet remayneth his blasphemouse doctryne amonge the cō∣mon people in a wonderfull nombre of cop∣pyes. I thought yt therfore mete / not vtter∣lye to destroye my labours / but for the abo∣lyshment of those wycked blasphemyes to suffre them passe at large. yet I instauntlye desyre the readers of my boke / not to thyn∣ke anye thynge therin spoken agaynst him / which is now becommen Gods seruaunte / but agaynst that olde pestysent Papyst Pan∣tolabus which styll yet blasphemeth Christ and his most faythfull wytnesses. Him wol∣de I not haue them to space / so longe as he dwesseth on the earthe / and that is that pro∣dygyouse Iest or Generacyon of heresye. Vnsemelye were yt / so manye swete scrip∣turs
to remayne so depraued / and so manye Godlye menne so slaunderouslye reported / the veryte in them both so spyghtfullye abu¦sed / for his names sake which hath wrought wyckedlye. Though Adam recanted his er∣rour / and Dauid his wycked workinges / Pe¦ter his denyall of Christ / and Paule his ty∣rannouse turmoylynges / yet are they not hydden in the scripturs / but made fiyll open to all the worlde / in reuke and warninge vnto vs of soche execrable euyls. Neuer y• lesse yet those vyces so rebuked / are now vn¦to them no rebuke / but a syngular prayse ra∣ther where as they are rehersed / beige whol¦le remitted in Christ. The great synne of A∣dam which is the onlye grounde of deathe in all mē is yet euerye yeare proclamed hap¦pye / amōge the Paschall ceremonyes. Whā Christ leaneth his churche vnrebuked and vntrobled forsynne / than rouneth she a stra¦ye by manye srunge and vncommaunded worshyppinges. Than reygneth she commō¦lye in a wycked peace / and abhominablye playeth the whore abusynge her selfe in the cowche of Iesabel. Apoca. 2. as of longe ty∣me hath done the Romyshe Synagoge. And so becommeth she no longer his chosen spou¦se / but a reproued congregacion. Moche mo¦re honoure is ours / whan our synnes are re∣buked by the scripturs / than whan the scrip¦turs remayne by vs reproued and slaunde∣red. Amonge the prophane Phylosophers &
Poetes / was euer the verite had in honou∣re / and preferred farre aboue all fleshlye a∣myte. Moche more than ought it so to be v∣sed amonge vs which are of the Christē sco∣le. The rebukes of this boke / wayeth vpon the matter and not the man / the spyghtfull blasphemer & not the godlye recanter. That his fylthye vomete is proued here abhomy∣nacion by the scripturs / to the intent that people shuld detest it and not therwith be poysened / can be vnto his name no deroga∣cion but rather a lawde amonge them that are godlye wyse. Verye vncomlye were it / that fylthynesse shuld haue fauer / and so be cowche vp as a precyouse treasure / amon∣ge menne of Christen honeste. Rather is it mete / that it were throwne fourth / & so ma∣nifesilye knowne for that it is / euen verye fylthynesse in dede. I haue no doubt therof / but. I. . becomminge the seruaunt of God vtterlye nowe detesteth that fowle Papyst Pantolab{us} that Romyshe rybalde / that ryo∣touse rayser with all his prodigiouse Poe∣syes and wolde haue him rather bayted a∣waye withe botchers dogges / than anye longar to wayte vpon him. Full glad are we to heare it / that frō Sodome he is lately departed / leauige that beast there behinde him to receyue the lordes double plage / and that his selfe nowe trauayleth (I trust) to∣wardes the mounte of sauegarde. That he is becomen of a wolfe a lambe / of a Saule a
Paule / and of a spyghtfull persecuter a god∣lye Christen preacher / it is vnto vs no smal reioyce. We lawde that heauenlye lorde / which thus of mere pytie and mercye hath founde out his almost peryshed shepe / layed him vpon his shulders / and brought him a∣geyne to his folde. If he styll perseuer accor∣dinge to his callinge. Heshall become of a forener a cytezen with the Sayntes / and a glouryouse partyner with Christ in his eter¦nall heritage. He shall also haue for his lust labours in the lordes vyneyarde here / besy∣des his penye wages his peculyar prayse in the sanctyfyed congregacyon of the ryghtouse. The eternall father & lor∣de Ies{us} Christ indue so wt his spre∣te both him & vs / that we maye vnto the ende perseuer faith¦full / to the counfort of his electes. Amen.

☜☜A mysterye of iny∣quite opened of Iohan Bale / by the manifesacion of Ponce Pantolabus Ge∣nealogye of heresye / in the year of owr lorde. M.D. and. xlii. A mysterye. 1 The Genealogye of heresye. 2 Compyled by Ponce Pantolabus ¶The openinge. O Therwyse can I not conicture of Pan¦tolabus / but that he hath put forth the¦se preciouse poesyes of some sett purpo¦se / eyther to be seane a famouse poete / or els to apere a mightye vpholder of the Popes holye churche. But yf he thinketh herin to haue my∣nistered vnto hys natiue region of Englande a doctrine of christen religion / he wonderful∣lye deceyueth himselfe. What they wyl sme to be by the towche stone of Gods worde / the sequele of this boke shall declare. I thinke nō other than the verye doctrine of deuyls / y• lyes of a popyshe hypocrite / the errours of a cruell Antichrist / the fylthye drinke of the whores cuppe of Babylon / and the stinkynge frutes of the botomlesse pytt. Expende first of all the tyttle of his tragedye / which ys / the Genealo¦gye of heresye / and ye shall fynde in yt small
goodnesse I suppose. Saint Paule ernestlye admonished his derelye beloued disciples Ty¦mothe and Tytus in anye wyse to shurne Ge¦nealogyes and fables as thinges most super∣luouse and vayne. 2 Panotlabus as one of a contrarye sprete and iudgement hath not onelye taken this for bydden office vpon him / but also vsed yt here in a moche worse kynde. For there is yt spoken concerninge. Iudaysme or vnnecessarye doub∣tes in Moyses lawe. Here doth he vsurpe yt in blasphemouse raylinges and vnshamefast lyes ageynst them whose lyues were moste in∣nocent and godlye. He sheweth himselfe ther∣for in this not onlye a spyghtfull aduersarye vnto Paules lerning / but also a cruell enemye both to Christ & his kynge / mynistrynge vn∣to that people soche doctrine of deuilyshnesse / of whome the one is the head the other his de¦pute / in that he is vndre him a christen gouer∣nour. Of this vnwholsom tyttle is yt easye to iudge / what the frutes are thervpon folowyn∣ge. Lete the Reader therfore marke them / and beware of those false Apostles whiche brynge them soche messages of myschefe. The Genea¦logye of Pantalabus now foloweth in course. A mysterye. 1 Blynde obstynacye. 2 Begate heresye. 3 By a myschaunce 4 Of dame ignoraunce.
Malicia eorum excecauit eos. Sap. 2. ¶The openinge. A Monstruouse beginninge hath this Ge∣nealogye declarynge at the first flushe both the mōstruouse hart of the author / & also the monstruouse nature of that maligna∣unt churche of Anticrist / of whom he is a pro∣fessed membre. Non other frute can the yll tre rendre / I se wele / than his owne frowarde na∣ture permitteth hi. For nought is yt not that manye excellent writers in discribinge Anti∣cristis kyngedome / hath called yt a false / fyl∣thye / fleshlye / whoryshe / preposterouse / prosty∣bulouse / promiscuouse / and abhominable gene¦racion. Here is the childe sayd to begett his fa¦ther / or the sonnes childe his grandefather / & all in y• femynine gendre. Wherfor yt is lyke to be a straūge hindred by that tyme that it be al brought forth. For here is blinde obstinacie reported to beget heresye / & yet was heresye manye years in the world before him. Non cā¦be obstynate in errour before he doth erre / nor wilfullye resyst y• verite before he doth hate it. 2 Rather shuld heresye therfore seme to brynge forth obstinacye / than obstinacye to en∣gendre heresye. For after the vocabulystes Tortellius / Valla / Perott{us} / Polycattus / Cre∣stonus / Calepinus / Guarin{us} / & soche other vo¦cabulystes: heresis / is not els but a choyse / opi¦niō / or secte. Not moche vnlyke vnto this doth Saynt Luke vse yt in the actes / and Saynt Paule also declaringe himselfe there a phary¦se.
Be it ones cowpled withean obstinate fro∣wardnesse or a wylfull resistaunce of the open verite / no longar is it an heresye / but an obsti∣nacye / rebellion / or diuisyon. Thus doth the scripture call the aduersaryes of Gods truthe on heretiques / but false prophetes / sewde a∣postles / deceitful teachers / and Anticristes. Therfore goeth Pantolabus vnlernedlye to worke in his Generacion of heresye. Rather shuld he haue begōne at the denyll which first begate darkenesse / and so haue gone forth frō darkenesse to ignoraunce / and from ignoraun∣ce to errour / with his bretherne in the captiui∣te of Babylon. Or els frō Anticrist to auarice frō auarice to symonye / & frō symonye to here∣sye in that veyne. And in so doynge / he myght at the las haue founde out his owne stinkynge sodomitycall generacion. 3 If this course had not pleased him for y• obseruacion of his meters / because he is a poe¦te lorrel / he might haue taken this waye with him. The false generacion. Of the popishe na¦cion. Begonne by the deuyll. The grounder of euyll. Of enuye and hate. The deuyll first be∣gate / The subtyle serpēt / Or worme pestilent The serpent by Cayne / Gote the kyndered vayne / Of bretherne vntrewe / That gods ser¦uauntes slewe. And so forth with the carnall chyldren of  / with Cham / Nem roth / the Sodomites / Ismael / Esau / Pharao / Manas∣ses / Antiochus / Phassur / the preses of Baall & of Bell. Herode / Cayphas / Iudas / Symon
magus / Bariehu / Diotrephes / with their suc¦cessours the Pope and his college of cardinal∣les / with his smered swarme of shauelynges both pylled & pye pecked. But this sort he cow∣de not fynde out / his eye syght is so yll on that syde. If blynde obstinacte were not his father I maruele / so moche lyght of the veryte being a brode and heretayninge so lyttle. I dare bol¦delye saye he was his leader & his great pro∣uoker ohā he made this worke. I thinke al dis¦crete readers will haue y• same opinion of him in that point that I haue here. Iugde thā whe¦ther he be out of his own Genealogye or naye. 4 Dame ignoraunce whom he here verefy¦eth to be y• mother of heresye / shuld seme to ha∣ue a great stroke in him / all circūstaūces mar∣ked / to make vp the generacion towardes him. The myschaunce wherof / though it be not per¦seyued of him for wāte of grace / yet is it know∣ne vnto vs by the frutes here. For neuer had we known what Pantolabusis / had not these poesyes declared him. All contrarye is he in opynion to the auncient doctours / yf he thin∣keth that the olde heretiques were ignoraunt & vnlerned. Saint Hierome reporteth of Ta∣cianus / that he famouslye taught the art of rhetoryck / and that he also wrote innumera∣ble workes. Marcellus was excedinge wit∣tye / and Sabinus was naturallye eloquent. Basilides compiled more than. xxiiii. volu∣mes vpon the scripturs. What Iustinus saith of Marcion / Hireneus of Montanus / Tertu∣lyane
of Valentinus / Cypriane of Nouatus / Saynt Augustin of Donatus Faustus and Felix. Saynt Cyryst of Nestorius / Pelagius / and Eunomius and other doctors of Arrius / Eutices / Fotinus / and soche other it were ve ye moche to wryte. And as concerninge Wy¦clef / Husse / Luther / Melanchton / and their fe¦lawes here regestred / it shall here after apere what they were. So that it shal wele be know¦ne that dame ignoraūce kepeth howse rather with Pantolabus and with other of his flla∣wes more in papistrye / than with them or with soche as they be in their sorte. 5 The text that he boroweth here of Sapi¦ence / Masicia corum exceauit / is as insy¦pientlye bestowed / as it had bene in the hande lynge of a moste insipient alle. The wyse man speaketh it of them whiche cruellye oppres∣seth the rightouse for rebukinge their euils / ta¦kinge for their auctoryte the lawes of vnrigh∣tousnesse. And of soche as examineth them wt spyghtfull rebukes and tormentes / so condēp∣ninge them to most shamefull deathe. Their malyce (sayth he) hath blynded them. So that it perteyneth whole to the blodye generacion of anticrist. Beholde therfor the blynde vnder¦standinge of this papist / howe he geueth it to blynde obstinacye / therwith to begett heresye of ignoraunce. Thinke ye not this scripture wele handeled? yes / and the deuil of hel shuld haue had the handelynge of it. yet is he nō he∣retyque amonge the bysshoppes / nor his boke
founde euyll / but put forth by the kynges pry∣uilege as a necessarye doctrine of their holye churche. O Englande Englande / miserablye plaged artthou to haue soche leaders. Praye to the eternall God to better it / and repēt thy vnthākefulnesse past / least thou perisshe with the wycked. Marke that foloweth in the next clause of the same Chapter of Sapience. Et¦ne scieunt sacramenta Dei &c. And ye shall fynde there that they which shuld be your in∣structers / vnderstandeth not the misteryes of God. They neyther hope for the rewarde of tightousnesse / nor yet regarde y• worship that the sayntes shall possesse. A mysterye. 1 Herefye begate. 2 Stryfe and debate. 3 Debate and ambycyon. 4 Begate supersticyon. 5 Odium suscitat rixas. Prouerb. 10. ¶The openinge. 1. BOldelye passeth forth this blynde poe∣te with his prodigyouse poesyes / to non other ende but to seduce the simple. Ne∣des wyll he haue heresye the father to stryfe & debate. And I am not ageynst it in that vnler¦ned kynde that he taketh it in without the au¦ctoryte of all good authors. But than I wolde not haue him to forget that heresye also bega∣te y• Popes power / with purgatorye / perdones /
& pylgrymages. He begate popishe presthode also of dame deuylyshnesse to synge. Masses at callettes heles for all christmas hooles. For sowles they may wele destroye / as they daylye do innumerable / but non can they saue by ther Masses. If their heresye hath not be∣gotten all abhominacions of Idolatrye in I∣mages / rodes / and rellyques / shrines / sorcery¦es / and subtylees / besydes their bastardes a brode / whose heresye hath done it? If their he resye begate not the gapinge rode of boxleye / the duckes blood of hayles / the worme aten ladye of walsyngham / holye Thomas Becket the trayter with a thousande soche other / besy¦des their holye occupiēge in Sodome and Go¦morre / manye menne are sore deceyned. 2 And as concerninge stryfe and debate / who hath engēdred more myschefe therin thā they? which to bringe their purposes to passe / hath subuerted so manye landes / destroyed so many dominiōs / subdewed so many emprours and kinges / besides their poysoninges / puttin¦ge out of eyes / and shaninge the right inheri∣tours into monkeryes / sumtyme y• father sum∣tyme the sonne / sumtyme y• dowter / sumtyme the mother / for non haue they spared in their furyes. yea / within the realme of Englande who cawsed kynge herolde to be slayne / kynge Iohan to be poysened / kynge Rycharde the se∣conde to be famished / and in a maner all other kynges to be vexed of their cōmons but they? was Iack Srawe and Wat Tyler with soche
other scysmatyckes / & now in owr dayes ma∣ster Aske and captayne Cobler / raysed by any other than by their oyled owlyshe generaciō? No trulye. For yf they were / the kynges laws hath done them wronge / to hange vp so ma∣nye in rochettes / whodes / cowles / and typpet¦tes / so smal reuerence had to their vnccions & shauinges. 3 This semeth Pantolabus to conferme in the next tyme folowinge / though he doth not so vtter it. Debate / (saith he) and ambiciō be∣gate supersticion. And he telleth the truthe of it / though it be sumwhat vnlernedlye for lac∣ke of godlye iudgement. For in dede after the papistes had by ther manifolde sysmes and diuisyons ones gotten the ouer handes of prin¦ces and worldlye gouerners by a tytle of spiri∣tualte / so crepinge into the weake consciences of menne. They beganne anon after ambyci∣ouslye to regne. Not onlye there exaltyng thē∣selues a boue God / & their owne stynkinge tra¦diciōs aboue his eternall verite / but also they outwardlye auaunced themselues by a mundy all Monarchie of pryde / Pompe / & vayne glo∣rye. Than mustred they in their myters / they sayled in their sylkes / they glyttred ī their gol¦des / ruffled ī ther rochettes / flickered in their furres / and ratled in ther rynges. 4 And to mainteyne that lucyferouse esta∣te of spirituall wickednesse in the stede of hea¦uenlye thynges / as Saint Paule doth call it / that they might sogloriouslye gouerne here in
darkenesse / they inuented all kyndes of super∣sticions in blessynges / bones / belles / candel¦styckes / cuppes / cruettes / oyle / waxe / light / ashes / palmes / and holye water / with soche o∣ther lyke. They dedicated stone walles / they cristened belles / they consecrated vestimētes they anoted chalyces / they hallowed aulters they tabernacled Images / they shryned dead mennes bones / they coniured / crossed / sensed / spatled / and breathed / with turne and halfe turne / and with seyst me and seyst me not / and a thousande feates more of cleane legerde may¦ne / to vpholde that mart of theyr maintenaun¦ce. And therfor he sayth wele here that ambi∣cyon begate supersticion / yf it had bene so tru∣lye applyed. For bysshoppes / monkes / and pre¦stes / hathe brought forthe all these spirituall frutes. 5 But where as he allegeth this text out of Salomons Prouerbes / Odium suscitatrix as / to proue that heresye begate stryfe and de∣bate / he sheweth himselfe no verie wyse inter¦pretour of the scripturs. But that he thought parauenture than / he might of thē make a wel¦che mannes hole / hauynge his lorde of Wyn∣chestire vpon his syde. Who can accuse him for an heretyque yf the Bysshoppes saye naye to it? though he playeth the deuyll with the scrip¦turs of god. It is their office neuer to pōnisshe them that peruerteth Gods worde / but to bur∣ne them alwayes that trulye preacheth it. Sa¦lomon sayth there / that hate engendreth braw¦lynges
or scysmes / & not that heresye begate stryfe. And that is spoken there of your vngod¦lye generacion / yf yow be they that are Idell worke menne and haue sluggyshe handes / op∣pressers of the poore and norryshers of synne / as all the worlde knoweth that ye are / hauin∣ge vnshame fast faces and presumptuouse mou¦thes.

But take hede of it and ye wyll ye are promised there that the thinge ye are most a frayde of shall come vpon yow. yowr hope shall perishe / and yowr years shall be shortened.

For the wickednesse of Sa¦mari is come to light. A mysterye. 1 Supersticion playne. Begate disdayne. 2 Dysdayne of trovvthe. Begate slovvthe. 3 Slovvthe & sluggyshnesse. Begate vvylfulnesse. 2 Vult & non vult piger. Prouer. 13. ¶The openinge. 1. CVryouslye styll countereth this chaunter of babylon with his mangye māgled me∣ters. For here one of thē halteth on y• one syde lyke a greye / being a syllabe shorter than
his fellawe. It is no maruele therfor though his name be slowthe / for in dede he commeth but slowlye after. Supersticion (ye saye bega∣te disdayne. And it maye welebe: for rather are his frutes afore rehersed of disdayne / than of loue / of hate than of fauer / of malyce than of pyte. And in dede the scripture sayth they are mockers and scorners / deridinge the verite / and withsandinge the helthe of the people. But surelye supersticion hath more children thā disdayne / yf Pantolab{us} loke wele abought him. Hypocresye which brought forthe latten houres / longe prayers without deuocion / leta∣nies / frydaye fastinges / owr ladies psalters / monkes / chanōs / fryres / nonnes / ankers / her∣mites / bedes / portasses / diurnals / tapers / tor∣ches / wepiges / crowchinges / knelynges / gad¦dinges / and soche other beggeryes els / shuld seme to be one of them. So shuld blasphemye also with all his abhominable of springe. 2 What disdayne this shuld be / he decla∣reth folowinglye / callynge it disdayne of trou¦the and the father of slouthe. This contēpt of godlynesse and verite sprange vp first in Cain and increased in the carnall children of mēne. And though it were in processe of tyme destroi¦ed in the generall flood / yet rose it vp ageyne after the dayes of No in Cham / and so grewe forth styll in Nemroth / Ismael / & in their wyc¦ked sede. After this had it continuaunce in the false prophetes and Idolatrouse prestes of Baal / in the Pharysees / Scribes / Bisshoppes
and heretyques / tyll the pope toke holde of it. Euer sens hath it bene gloryouslye maintey∣ned of his anoynted clergye / with churches / minsters / monasteryes / couentes / cloysters / colleges / vniuersytees / prīces lawes / swerde fyre / & halter. Whiche gloriouse habytacions hath pampred vp fatt foggye monkes / proude porkyshe prestes / great bellyed bysshoppes / as brockyshe bores in a swynes flye / in all body∣lye ease of slouthfull sluggyshnesse / Idelnes∣se / lechery / and beasilynesse / there wallowyn∣ge in Sodome and Gomorre. But trulye I thī¦ke it a great ouersyght of Pantolabus / that he here forgate scolasticall diuinite / which made the Pope Gods vicar / the head of the churche and the keye berer of purgatorye to lete out & in at his pleasure / for it hath also rysen of dis∣dayne of the truthe. 3 Of a lykelyhode wylfulnesse had .ii. fa∣thers / not all vnlyke to bishoppes bastardes / & to the popishe prestes children Which hath one father that beareth the name / & an other that toke paynes to begett him. For here are slouthe & slughyshnesse both named to be his fathers. But doubtlesse the right hayres are not here remembred / nor yet they that styll oc∣cupye their landes. And that are all puffed vp prelates / with persones / vicars / and curates. And hardelye lete not syr hugh holye water swynger be forgotten amonge thē. The thro∣winge a syde of the sacred scripturs / and the false deceyuinge of the poore laboringe man∣ne /
shuld seme also to be twygges of the same braunche and sprayes of the same sprygge / yea and to be sumwhat afore wylfulnesse in this generacion. And therfore Pantolab{us} is but a ole / and foloweth to moche the counsell of da¦me ignoraūce in the descripciō of this Genea¦logie / or els he is a parciall frinde to wylful∣nesse. And I thinke that be the verie cause in dede. This sure holde also he hath vpon his syde / that painters / poetes / and Rome tōners maye lye by auciorite. 4 The text whiche he hathe torne out of Salomons prouerbes / vult et non vult piger / proueth nothinge to the purpose that sluggish¦nesse and slouthe begate wylfulnesse. More honeste were it for him that dame ignoraunce were farder of from his elbowe / whan he shall sett his handes to the scripturs. Sathan in y• desert neuer bestowed Angelis suis Deus mā dauit dete more vnclarkelye / than this text is here bestowed. Salomons mynde is / that y• sluggarde wold fayne haue / but it cometh not so vnto him / where as the diligent labourer is habundauntlye suffysed. For thus standeth y• text after the truer translacion. Concupiscit anima pigri / et non est ei quod optat. But as the sainge is / the full fedde sowe seketh myre / the vyle vermine corrupcion / as Pantolabus hath done here the corrupt translacion for his purpose. And yet will it not serue for slouthe to beget wilfulnesse / though he turne it .xxiiii. wayes / as fryre martyn ded his desardes hart
Wonderfullye now a dayes are the scripturs handeled in Englande / yet are there non here¦tyques on that syde of the waye. For how can a papist be an heretyque to his hinderaunce / whan papistes weare styll myters and robes. It foloweth in the same chapter. Astutus om∣nia agir cum consilio / qui autem factu{us} est / a∣perit stulticiam. A wyse manne doth all with discressiō but a foole declareth his folye. But this coude not Pantolabus fynde out / wt other godlye coūsels there mēcioned. Wherfore his part here after is lyke to be sumwhat y• worse. A mysterye. 1 Vvylfulnesse verelye. Nygh cosyne to heresye. 2 Begate myschefe. Father of vvyclefe. 3 Vvhich ded bringe inne. His grand father synne. 4 Qui facit peccatum ex diabolo est, quo∣niam ab inicio diabolus peccat. Ioan. 3. The openinge. 1. DIuerslye doth this popishe poete resem¦ble himselfe / alwayes as blynde as a byttle / and wotteth not wele which wa¦ye to wandre. yet will he styll forewarde with his pedlarie wares Wilfulnesse he saith (whō he hath preferred here in his Genealogye to his other brethern / I am sure for some olde fa¦milyar
acquayntaunce) beynge nigh cosyne to heresye / begate mischefe. It shuld seme here vnto me / that Pantolab{us} is not verie wele se¦ane in genealogyes / or els he daunseth withe Iacke of Bedlem a voluntarye rounde or a ga¦learde at his pleasure. For here he calleth he∣resye cosyne to wylfulnesse / and yet he is .vi. degrees afore him. yea / and to make his owne asynishe rudenesse more manifest therin / he calleth him here his nigh cosyne. Trulye this is to folyshe to haue yt scripturs coupled withe it / yf Boner and Wynchestre with other holye fathers wynke not vpon it whā they honte for heretyques. But parauenture he doth it here that wylfulnesse shuld be known to be all one with heresye / or els to make good his purpose folowinge / as to proue Ioan Wyclef an here∣tyque. But as the Prophete sayth / he that pre∣pareth a snare for an other / most cōmonlye fal¦leth into it his selfe / as Pantolab{us} hath done here / yf the abhominable peruertige of Gods worde be a kinde therof. 2 He saith that wylfulnesse begate mische¦fe / and I beleue it wele. For Pope Hyldbran¦dus (which inhibited prestes mariage) poyso∣ned: vi. of his predecessours to optaine the pa¦pacye. Pope victor the thirde was poysoned at his masse by a spirituall chaplayne of his. So was henrye the .vii. Emprour by one Bernar∣dinus de monte policiano a dominick fryre / in receyuinge the sacrament. Pope Clement the seconde / vigilius. Sisinnius / Ioannes septi¦mus /
Alexander / and aboue .xl. of them mo¦re / were sent out of the worlde by the same spirituall polecye. How manye poore cristen innocentes the .ii. horned termagauntes of Englande hath put vnto deathe for the on∣lye truthe of God / it were moche to write. Wynchestre yet aliue is foūde no sluggarde in tha tormēting office of Anticrist though he neyther syth Standyshe nor Pantolab{us} fryre wattes nor quarry y• pardoner / wt soche other abhominable blasphemers of Gods worde. Therfor tyrannye also might haue in for a childe of wyckednesse and a brother of myschefe / yf it had pleased ma∣ster Pantolabus. So might cruell murther / the slaughter of saintes / and the vtter con∣tempt of God / haue bene called the fylthye of springe therof / and not poore Iohan wyc∣clef the verie manne of God / for withstan∣dinge Anticrist and his false kingedome / yf the true quarell of Christ had here bene so ernestlye sought as is the Popes quarell / though it be not so spoken. 3 That anye manne shuld be father to his grande father / as Pantolabus here no∣teth Iohan Wyclef / it is a matter impossi∣ble in the right course of generacion. But as he hath a monstruouse wytt / so sendeth he forth mōstruouse frutes to deceyue y• simple. Of a spyghtfull malice is it / not of Wyclef but of the verite that he taught / that he th{us} nameth him the sonne of mischefe. For Wy¦cleues
father as cōcerninge the fleshe was a christen beleuer / and a manne geuen to nō yll ha we rede of. I can not tell what euill sprete hath taught Pantolabus to be a slaū¦derouse accuser of his brother / vnlesse it we¦re he that accused Iob. And as concernin∣ge the inwarde manne / he was a sonne of God / lyke as all they are by his heauenlye gyft that beleue in his name. For non can protest that Iesus is the Lorde God / as he ded most constauntlye ageynst the whole re¦gne of Anticrist / but in the holye ghost. For so moche as raylinge Pantolab{us} falselye re∣porteth of Iohan Wyclef without auctorite that he brought in his grandefather synne / I am enforced to answer in his behalfe by y• auctorite of soche notable writers as I ha∣ue seane and redde. Iohan Wyclef beynge an Englyshe mā∣ne borne / and a doctor of diuinite / aboute y• year of owr Lorde a .M.CCC. and .lx. red∣de the common lecture at oxforde / and so cō¦tynued many yeares after. And as cōcernin¦ge his eloquence / witt / manyfolde lerninge and most innocent lyfe / Philippus repinge∣don Bysshop of Lyncolne / Nicolaus herfor∣de a Doctor / Ioannes Treuisa / Galfridus Chawcer / Ioannes Husse / Eneas Siluius Hermannus Shedel / and now in owr tyme O tho Brunfelsius hath in most ample for∣me described them / besides the large witnes¦se of his enemies / as of Iohan kyuyngham /
Thomas Walden / and soche other. yea / so∣che tyme as Wyllyā Thorpe in his exami∣nacion reported him to be a manne of most christen sobryete / conforminge his lyfe and lerninge to the doctrine of Christ and the lyuinge of his Apostles. Thomas Arondell than Archebysshop of Canterberye / beinge both an aduersarye to him and to the verite that he had taught / affermed him with his owne mouthe to be a great clarke and a per∣fight lyuer. The stomake that he bare ageīst him was for his doctrine. For that (he sayd) was▪ not agreable to the lawes of holye chur¦che. And yet he graunteth afore that it was agreable to Christ and to his Apostles. He coude not awaye in dede with their popishe tradicions / but called them the fylthye fru∣tes of Anticrist. He sayd he wolde no longar aparell the Asse that Christ shuld ryde vpō with their vayne rytes and ceremonies / but folowe the clere doctrine of his Sauer Ie∣sus / which glorified in heauē / hath nede of no soche Idell offices to be done to him. kynge Edwarde the thirde sumwhat fa∣uored him for his godlye giftis / as I haue sufficientlye to proue it. So ded kinge Ry∣charde the seconde as he durst preuylye / wt afterwarde cost him his lyfe. In this beleue Iohan Wyclef contynued / and was person of Lutterworth in lyncolne shere. And in the year of owr lorde a .M.CCC.lxxxvii. this true Apostle of Christ most constantlye and
cristenlye departed from this worlde com∣mēdinge his sowle into the handes of God. His workes were wonderful and manye / as I intende to declare God lendinge me lyfe in an other worke. Of whom Subinco lepus than Bysshop of Prage / brent more than .ii. hondreth great volumes fayre written / as witnesseth Eneas Siluius in his boke de origine Bohemorum. The .xli. yeare after his deathe / which was the year from Chri∣stes incarnaciō a M.CCCC. and .xxviii. by a cruell decree from the generall counsell of Cōstance / were his bones taken vp agey∣ne and brent by the clergye of Englande / as testifieth Walden in lib. de sacramentalib{us} Cap. 89. et fo. 199. to make foles afrayed. Nō hath condempned this wyclef for an herety¦que / but the Pope and his sworne soudiours whose cause / matter / and quarell Pantolab{us} hath here taken vpō him to defende / though it be with a small faythe to God & his Prin∣ce / and moche lesse honeste to his owne pre∣ciouse persone. 4 As touchinge his allegacion out of Io¦hans first Epistle. Qui facit peccatum ex¦diabolo est / to proue that mischefe begate Wyclef. The deuyll his master (of whom it is there spoken) might haue vttered  as godlye and to as moche edificacion of y• the as he hath done here. He that doth syn¦ne (sayth the text) is of the deuill. For the deuill styll synneth after his olde wōe and can do non other. I maruele of Pantolabus
that he coude thus with this clause blasphe¦me his dead brother in the handes of God / without all godlye feare / & thinke not ther∣in to synne. If he had marked the argumēt of that chapter wele / he shuld haue founde in it Gods singular loue towardes vs / to that ende that we shuld loue here one an o∣ther. And not to condempne by name or to make raylinge rymes of him bycause the Po¦pe hath condempned him afore. For by non other auctorite is Wyclef condēpned. Who securses God doth blesse / and ageyne doth curse his blessinges. Lete Pantolabus therfor be ware. For though he hath nowe both his good lorde of Wynchesters blessyn¦ge and the Popes / he maye chaunce yet to dwell vndre Gods curse. I Wondre that the Bysshppes so narrow¦lye serchinge for heretiq̄s / cā not here smell out both an heretique and a traytour. Hap∣plye thei are so vsed to that sauer out of their owne bosomes / that thei knowe not the one from the other. But maye saye. Thu and I are both one mannis children. Saye wele by me / and I shall do as moche forthe. By this text folowinge is Wyclef discharged of that Pantolabus layeth to him. Qui na∣tus est ex deo / peccatum non facit / quoniāsemen ipsius in Deo manet. He that is bor∣ne of God (as Iohan Wyclef was receyuyn¦ge Christes doctrine in faythe) synneth not / he folowing that doctrine in his lyfe though
he doth despyse all the Popes tradicions / as he ded also. For the sede of God which is his eternall worde remayninge styll in him / wyll not permyt hī to synne by no soche blas¦phemouse popetrye. Thys strayght waye ha¦uinge the sure promises of God perseyueth not Pantolab{que} / but strayeth wyldelye a bro¦de with the renegate Cain / desperatlye tru¦stinge to the promises of menne syckle and vncertayne / as their tradicions hath non other. A mysterye. 1 After this brother. Came forth an other. 2 His name to discusse. Menne called him husse. 3 He and his cumpanye. Began in Germanye. 4. He est gens que non audiuit vocer domini sui. Hiere. 2. The openinge. 1. EVermore doth pantolab{us} pranke forth with his pylde Popyshe Poesyes not vnlyke Iacke of Bedlem with his net full of wolle. From that bryer hath he gathe¦red that lock all tarrye / and from that thor∣ne that patche all dryseled. Lete him that hath eyther lerninge or witt / marke what dyrtye gete this is / and from what good au∣thors
borrowed. The grounde therof was first taken out of Pope Benedyct the .xiii. po¦pe Gregorye the .xii. and Pope Iohan the .xxiii. all thre deposed at ones in the gene∣rall counsell of Cōstance / & out of the cowy∣she actes and proclamacyons of Pope Mar∣tyne the fift which after supplied their rome there vpon the seate of the beast in the dar∣ke kyngedom of Anticrist or the chayre of pe¦stylence whether ye wyll. Here is the name of a brother most scornefullye vsed / whiche is in the scripturs both holye and preciouse And no maruele. For crist sayd there shuld come soche swyne as wolde treade the fayre pearles vndre their fete / and soche dogges also as wolde turne ageyne & teare his true disciples. The chefe cause of it is / that his hipocrites eyes can abyde no light. But lete him not thinke so to auoyde the great indig∣nacion of God / nor yet anye other soche scor¦ner as he is. 2 Iohan Husse that holye Apostle and true Martyr of Iesus Christ / moche pyteyn¦ge to se y• churche so wretchedlye deformed with hypocresye / pryde / Idolatrye / & other abhominaciōs of Anticrist / after he had sum what perseyued therof by the doctrine of Io∣han Wyclef / put forth his owne bodye to y• crosse for it / to suffre the death yf nede shuld require it. The pure lawe of the Gospell wa the scripturs of both testamētes ded he most constantlye preache to the pople of Boheme
ageynst that kyngdom of wyckednesse / dete∣stinge all errours / heresyes / & scysmes. His conuersacion was accordinge to his instruc¦cyons / perfight and holye. Not onlye by the report of .liiii. noble menne of the lande of Morania / but also by the testimonye of his enemyes / Pope Pius otherwyse called Ee as Siluius / Pogius the Florentyne / Plati∣na / Sabellicus / and soche other. In the opē counsell of Constance spared not he to con∣fesse y• true fayth of his Lorde Iesus Christ to the deathe / and was at the last condemp∣ned thervnto at the suggestions of the Do∣minick fryres & other vnlerned sophisters. He sayd that it behoued the Bysshoppes & clergie to be poore after the exāple of christ and not so to fyue in pryde an voluptuous∣nesse. And this was the onlye artycle wher¦for he was brent there to ashes / though the papistes hath practised other. 3 What Pantolab{us} meaneth by that cū¦panye of his which begāne in Germanye / I can not tell / vnlesse they be the Hussytes as the wytlesse Papistes doth call them. I kno∣we wele that both the Apostles and Prophe¦tes were of that opinion / yet were they no Germanes borne. Nomore dishonour is it to the most worihye lande of Germanye to be∣scornefullie dispraysed of pantolabus / than it is vnto golde to be bespryncled with swy∣nes dyrt. Consideringe that after the myn∣de of Seneca it is so fylthye a thinge to be cōmēded of him that is vyle / as to be cōmen∣ded
for fylthynesse. But this maketh me gre¦atlye to wondre. That so manye heretiques beynge afore this tyme / as were Hebion / Ce¦rinthus / Carpocras / Marcion / Basilides / Arrius / Cerdo / Pelagius / Eunomius / Ne∣stori{us} / Dioscor{us} / Etices / Sabin{us} / Faust{us} / Donat{us} / Heluidi{us} / Manes / Montan{us} / No∣uat{us} / Porphiri{us} / Petulian{us} / Sabelli{us} / Sergi¦us / Simach{us} / Vigilanci{us} / Valens / Macedo¦ni{us} / Artemon / Symon Mag{us} / & a great nā∣bre besydes / which were heretyques indede blasphemige the godhede & diuinite of crist besydes his humanite & deathe / yet is there not one of them in all this Genealogie. The cause parauēture whye he towcheth them not is this. They were for y• more part Bysshoppes & great Prelates / whose quarel he hath here takē vpon him to defende & not so to blemishe. There were in the olde lawe yll sectes / as Pharisees / Saducees / Herody¦anes / & Samaritanes. And in the new law also Saracenes / Turkes / Iewes / & Iacoby¦nes. There hath bene Popes which hath be¦ne poyseners / Byshoppes that hath bē baw¦des / Prests that hath ben trayters / fryres / monkes / & chanōs which hath bene hypocri¦tes / socerers / & sodomites / & that in a won∣derful nōbre / yet is there not one regestred in all this generacion of heresye. Not one heretyque is yet here named / but poore Io∣han Wyclef & Iohan Husse / of all the hereti¦ques that hath bene sens christes ascensiō.
And they are here regestred because they we¦re the Popes vtter enemies. If anye other heresyes than that had moued the stomake of Pantolabus / all the other coude not thus haue bene left out. But a manne maye smell the tree by the frute. He that seyth not some light at this hoole / is wurthye to be blynde alwayes. It wyll not awaye (they saye) that is bred by the bone. Full swete vnto them is that holye father of theirs. 4 The clause of Hieremye that he hath here vnto annexed / Hee est gēs que non au∣diuit vocem dominisui / is not there writen in the seconde Chapter. And yf it were / yet wolde it not serue to proue that Husse and his cumpanye beganne in Germanye / nor yet that the Germanes neglected the voice of God whan they forsoke the Pope. For the Pope is not their Lorde. But in dede this text is in that Chapter. Tenentes legem / nescierunt me. They which haue the lawe in their handes knoweth me not. They ha∣ue walked after their owne fantasies / & are now become all vayne. They haue defyled my pleasaunt lande (sayth the Lorde) & tur∣ned myne heretage into abhominaciō. The prestes haue dishonoured me / and the prea∣chers haue done their homage vnto Baall. They haue forsaken me the well of lyuinge water / and dygged them broken pyttes that wyll holde no moystre. They haue called y• stocke their father / and the stone their crea∣tor.
They haue stayned my wayes with blas¦phemie / thei haue taught their owne maly∣cyouse mischefe / and vpon their winges is founde the blood of innocēt sowles. All this with moche more is in that seconde chapter of Hieremie / yet coude it not serue the purpo¦se of Pantolabus / but he must brynge forth a text of his own makinge ageynst the Ger¦manes / bycause they haue not obeyed the Pope. A mysterye. 1 And after that. Came in a gnat. 2 Of the same kynde. Vvhose sovvle is blynde. 3 His name you shall here. Menne call him Luthere. ¶The openinge .1. Frth halteth Pantolabus and styll ta¦keth great paynes hereto manifest his owne madnesse / and to defende y• smal veriu & lesse grace of his popishe generaciō: The gnat that his blinde predecessers hath so longe strayned out / hath he no grace to perseyue / for all the lyght that hath bene in the worlde these .xx. years and more. He fa¦reth lyke a frowarde curre which barketh a∣geynst the mone for shyninge in his face in the nyght. He seyth not that those blinde gy¦des of his are curyouslye busyed in thinges
of no value / but in the wayghtye causes of the gospell they are all negligēt & vntowar∣de. Great religion shwe they in foppryes for auaūtage / but the holye cōmaūdemētes of God they miserablye contēpne. Bysshop Bōner made Towyn to stande forth at Pau¦les Crosse for a notoryouse heretyque nowe of late / bycause he made not his holye wa∣ter relygiouslye after the popes olde rewles & by cause he went not procession with Ora¦pro nobis at uensonge But ye neuer se him nor other of his fllawes put anye to open shame for not preachinge the Gospell / or for doinge Idolatrye / sorcerye / murther / rape / & violence. Or for misusinge mēnis wyues / dowrers / seruauntes / & children / with soche other fysthye enormites. Of all the Sodo∣mitee they haue as there are amonge them innumerable) ye neuer sawe one yet stande forth for an heretyque. No / alsoche mattere are discharged in y• court without consciēce. 2 Whom Pantolabus meaneth by that gnatt that shuld be of the same kynde with Wyclef & Husse / & whom he iudgeth in sow∣le to be blinde / we vnderstāde by that which foloweth here after. It is Mariyne Luther the verye trompet of this latter age of Chri¦stes Churche / whose bootes to rubbe / & to fo¦lowe him with a wyspe to the Iakes Panto∣labus shuld seme to be more fyt / than eyther to iudge his lerninge or decerne his faythe. Who hath sane a more dodypoll fole and a
more blynde assehead / than he sheweth him¦selfe here in these dyrtye Poesyes? He that iudgeth them not to be the frutes of a sowle supersticiouse & most wretchedly darkened / hath verye small godlye vnderstādinge. If that sowle be not blinde wt iudgeth whight to be blacke & vertu to be synne / there is no sowle blinde in my opinion. Sum tyme was he rekened for an heretyque that dissented in opinion from the Gospell & from the speci¦all articles of owr Christen faythe. But now is it nothinge so. For in this whole descrip∣cion of heresye is not one founde of that hin¦de / as I haue shewed twyse afore. But here are they noted onlye for heretyques which hath renounced the Popes obedience. Ther¦for it is a newe maner of heresye that is he∣re set out for menne to be ware of / than was in those dayes. 3 God hath at a tyme permitted the false Prophete to speake that was true. As we haue for exāple. Balaam the sorcerer / Saul the disobedient kynge / Cayphas the cruell Bysshoppe / and Pylate the vnryghtfull iud¦ge. But he gaue them not with it to vnder∣stande that they vttered. Pantolabus hath here mencioned Martyne Luther to be of the same kynde that Wyclef and Husse we∣re of. yet hath he done yt of a wycked spre∣te / and knoweth not what he hath writ∣ten. But the Prophecye of the seyd Io∣han Husse whiche he vttred at the houre of
his deathe / shall make that saynge good. Centum reuolutis annis / Deo respondebi∣tis e mihi. An hondreth years ones past (sayth he to the papystes) to God shall ye an¦swer and to me. By this he ment that after an hondreth years / they shuld beginne to cō¦sent to his doctrine whō at y• tyme they con∣dempned / and in proces of tyme graunt it to be agreable to the scriptures of God. This Prophecye ded the Bohemes inprint vpon the one syde of their coynes and so reserued it from the yeare of owr Lorde a. M.CCCC and .xv. tyll vnto the yeare of owr Lorde a∣geyne a. M.CCCCC. and .xvii. In the wc Martyne Luther impugned the Popes par∣dons / power / and auctorite by the open wor∣de of God. And therfor Pantolab{us} hath spo∣ken it trulye / that Luther is of the same kyn¦de. But where as he hath done it of spyght and malyce / he sheweth himselfe to be of a contrarye part. As where that Luther is the popes great enemye / he is his trustye frinde and louer. A mysterye. 1 He by his meane. Hath bānyshed cleane. 2 Out of that coste. The holye ghoste. 3 And hath brought inne. Lyberte and synne. 4 Posuerunt templū sanctum. Psal. 78.
The openinge. 1. GReat busynesse maketh Pantolabus herewith Martyne Luther for ban∣nishynge that sprete of theirs which hath so longe vpholden their popishe chur∣che of proude porkelynges / the synagoge of Sathan / the rose coloured whore / and the spowse of the deuyll. This sprete is not the holye ghost as he is here reported / but the sprete which went out from the manne and returned ageyne with .vii. spretes worse thā himselfe. As with the sprete of errour / the sprete of falshede / the sprete of sorcerye / the sprete of lyes / the sprete of fornicacion / the sprete of hypocresye / and the sprete of the vt¦ter contēpt of God with all other abhomina¦cyons of vayneglorye malyce / muther / and Idolatrye. In these spretes haue they gouer¦ned their gloriouse churche of Antichrist / e∣uer sens they sprange vp vndre Phocas wt Mahomete. Specyallye sens Syluester the sorcerer fat the deuyll from hell to graunt to his confirmacion and to geue him the iuris∣diccyon of both swerdes. In these fylthye spretes also haue their horned whoremon∣gers euer sens by the same auctoryte banni∣shed all godlye veritees and knowlege / ex∣rcysynge all tyrannye / cruelte / and vyolen¦ce possible / to holde the peple in darkenesse and ignoraunt blyndenesse. And this in de∣de hath Martyne Luther lyke christes true disciple with all dilygence sought to redres∣se /
which moueth not a lyttle here the sycke stomake of Pantolabus / he beinge the Po∣pes Apostle. 2 But that holye ghost which is the spre of wysdome / knowlege / counsell / force / scien¦ce / pyte / and the true feare of God / hath not Martyne Luther exyled / as he is here of this lymme of the deuyll most falselye repor¦ted. His workes shall in this poynt stande with him as wytnesses ageynst Wynchestre Bonner / Standishe / Wattes / Quarrye the pardoner / Pantolabus / and all their affini∣te / though they haue all the deuyls of hell vpon their syde. He that shal reade his boke ageynst y• Iewes / quod Christus Iudes sit natus / & his commentaries vpon the scrip∣turs with his other treatyses / conferrynge them with the Popes olde diuinite / Decre∣es / and Decretals / Extrauagantes / Cle∣mentynes / and Synodals / shall fynde them so moche to dyffer from them as lyght doth dyffer from darkenesse or Christ frō Belial / yf he be Christenlye lerned. It fareth here by Pantolabus as it doth by him that daun∣seth naked in a nt / thinkynge that no man∣ne seyth him whan all the world beholdeth him a presumptuouse Idyote fole. No māne there is which seyth anye truthe / but persey¦ueth that the sprete which prouoketh Mar∣tyne Luther to destroye the Popes kyngedō / is a cleane contrarye sprete to that wc hath regned in the Pope and his clergye. And
therfor yf the Popes sprete be of y• deuyll as the scripture sayth it is / his sprete must ne∣de b: of God. And therfor Pantolabus ho∣lye ghost (whom Luther hath bannisshed) is not of God but of the deuyll. 3 What lyberte this is that Pantalab{us} here coupleth with synne makinge them all one /  cā not wele tell / vnlesse it be fre will. And ther vnto geueth Martyne Luther no lyberte that is godlye / as testifyeth his bo∣ke de Seruo arbitrio. And therfor is Panto∣la{us} moche to be blamed so to slaundre him. But in dede his Lorde of Wynchestre hath brought in that lyberte now of late by y• good helpe of Eckis the dowtye doctor of the pa¦pystes / and taketh great paynes vpon him to make it a newe article of the fayth of En¦glande. I thinke not the contrarye but his great hot stodye is also to sett vp purgato∣rye ageyne / reparinge the broken chest of y• churches olde suffrages / deseruinges / and merites / to redeme the brent sowles and sen¦de them to hauē by the vertu of Scala cel. And therfor yf Pantolabus fynde fawte in the bringinge in of that lyberte / lete him bla¦me his good lorde for it & not Luther. The synne that he here speaketh of shuld seme to be Prestes marryage. For that in dede they put out as an horryble synne whan they to∣ke their oyled orders and were marryed to Sodome & Gomor. If Luther hath brought that in ageyne and dryuen out their soueray¦ne
ladye and swete sacred Sodomye / he is worthye to be condempned of them for an he¦retyqye. For holye Pope Hyldebrāde which was a Necromanser made this constitu∣cion / that non shuld be admitted to holye or∣ders / vnlesse he forsware marriage for ter∣me of his lyfe. Which constitucion hurt him nothinge at all / he hauinge at his pleasur Mawde y• Duchesse of Lotharyne with ma∣nye other more out of marryage. 4 Farre out of frame is the scripture / which he hath here alleged to conferme wt his folyshe purpose / Polluerunt templum tu¦um. O lorde God (sayth Asaph the prophe∣te) a peple is broken into thyne herytage / which hath defyled thy holye temple. If the Popes churche were ment by that temple / this text is falselye applyed to Luther and his companye. For they haue not broken in∣to that churche / but gone out of it as all the worlde knoweth. And in the verses folowin∣ge are they mencyoned / that destroyed the faythfull seruaūtes of God by sheding their blood and geuynge their fleshe to the fow∣les of the ayre. Effuderunt sanguinem co∣rum tanquam aquam. What they are that haue y• true beleuers in soche deadlye dery∣siō / it were easye ynough to perseyue though we had nothinge els to proue it but this pre¦sent Genealogye. Neuer shall ye e that spi∣ritualte of theirs persecute anye other / thā the louers of the truthe. Wynchestre at this
houre honteth nether for thefe nor murthe∣rer / aduouterer nor whore keper. If he ded / there shuld not so manye of them so bolde∣lye diuell at the next dore to him. But there shall not apere a reader of Christes gospell / that he shall not haue by the sleue by and by. He syth not Pantolabus here / which is an heretyque in dede / yf an heretyque be a per∣uerter of y• scripturs / for they are of an other veyne that he coueteth. He shuld not els be his mothers owne darlynge. HEre though I seme sumwhat to digre∣de / yet shall it be no digressyon / but a ne∣cessarye relayon / consyderyng that Pan¦tolabus hath so spyghtfullye accused matry∣monye for synne. Sumwhat shall it be nede∣full to shewe here to the commendacyon of that godlye estate of lyuynge / and to the vt∣ter reproche and shame of the contempners therof by the scriptures & chronicles. To non other ende ded y• Pope wt his prelates first inhybyt prestis their marryage / but to ape∣re therby an holy spirituall kyngdome deuy∣ded from the prophane multitude / & to lyue in all voluptuousnesse & deceyt. Marke fyrst their vngodlye sprete by this. The lorde cō∣maunded not Dauid to put from him Bersa∣be after the death of Vrias for the aduoute∣rye afore committed / but both allowed her after for his wyfe / & also greatlye loued the seconde frute of her begotten which was Salomon. The Rome churche as a congre∣gacyon
cleane contrarye to God in that / cō∣maunded their prestes first not onlye to for∣sake their most lawfull wyues / but also to leaue their most dere chyldren as frutes of fornicacyon / which cruelte we haue also felt in this age. And thus hath holye wedlock bene vnto them euer sens a most pernycyou∣se poyson / and stynkynge whoredome with buggerye a most suffren remedye of their na∣turall dyssease. Soche hath bene their sa∣thanycall tyrannye euer sens. A great aduersarye to that holye office was Pope Nycolas the first in the yeare of oure lorde. D.ccc.lxiiii. tyll Huldrichus the good bishop of Augusa in Germanye with∣stode his deuyllyshe hypocresye. yet was a wyfe non impediment to holye aynt Nyco¦las longe afore that / which was of a cōmon cytezen made the archebisshop of Myrhea and metropolytane of all the whole lande of Lycia. Nomore was it to Ignaci{us} / Hermas / Ananus / Pheleas / Spiridion / Valens / Hi∣larius / Polycrates / Dionysius Corintheo∣rum / Tartulianus / Cheremon / Basilius se∣nior / Gregorius Nazianzenus / Eupsicht{us} / Philogonius / Vitalis / Apollinaris / Vrsin{us} / Pharo Burgundus / Genebaudus / Gerol∣dus / and a great sort more / which had both wyus and chyldren / & yet they all were pre∣stes and bisshoppes. Moche better (sayth Baptista Mantuan{us}) was their yfe in mar∣ryage / than is now the lyfe of the spiritual∣te
without it. For a great consyderacyon (sayth Pius the Seconde Pope / otherwyse called Eneas Siluius) was marriage first inhibited to prestes / but for a moche great∣ter ought yt ageyne to be graunted them. Saynt Peter y• holye Apostle was not asha∣med at Antiochia / whan his wyfe was led∣de vnto death to cal her by her name (which was Eolam / or in the latyne Perpetua after writers) And to saye vnto her in the myddes of the multitude. Swete wyfe remēbre thy Lorde Iesus Christ / & feare not thē which sleyth the bodye / for they can do no harme to the sowle. Onlye couetousnesse & ambycion inter∣dicted this marryage / which hath geuen or casion to wonderfull mischeues / as I haue declared at large in my answer for Tolwyn ageynst the Bysshop of London. To whom I haue added these historyes folowynge v∣pon iust occasyons here geuen me / bycause they are yet so good vnto marriage. Pope Io¦han the. viii. was a woman / & was begotten with chylde by her owne dere chaplayne & chamberlayne a Cardinall / which God at that tyme wolde haue known to the worlde that their churche might apere as it was in dede / all whorishe / fylthye / and beastlye / ly∣ke as the Apocalips hath described her. yet was the worlde so blynde / that it neuer per∣seyued it / tyll nowe of late years. Marozia caused her husbande Guido / which was
than Marques of Chuscia / to strangle Po∣pe Iohan the .ix. with a pyllowe and to slee his brother Peter / that the bastarde which she had by Pope Sergis the thirde whan she was his concubyne / myght be saynt Pe∣ters vycar after his father. As he was sone after in dede / and was called Pope Iohan the .x. Iohan the .xii. Pope begate of his whore Iohan the .xiii. Pope / & in short spa∣ce after was stryken to death of the denyll as he was in doynge an other holye acte of bytcherye. By the auctorite and commaundement of this holye vycar of sathan / ded saynt Don∣stane here in Englande forbydde Prestes their wyues / and had thervnto the assisten∣ce of kynge Edgare. By the which occasyon Oswald{us} than bisshop of Worcestre / expel∣led the canons out of their cathedrall chur∣che and out of .vi. churches more of his dyo∣cese / and thrist in monkes there to supplye their romes / onlye bycause they worlde not leaue their wyues / for he his selfe had also bene a monke. Ehelwoldus in lyke case the bisshop of Wynchestre / ded the same selfe holye acte also at the same tyme in his dyo∣cese / for e arose also of y• same generacyon. The prestes not cōtented wt so spyghtfull an niurye / thought they wolde be euen with saynt Donstane for it / as they were in dede. For whan he shuld make his purgacyon be∣fore the kynge in y• generall synode / for soche
matters as they had by that tyme bulted out / he had moche a do to saue all thynges honest / yet had he both the prelated and kyn∣ge vpon his syde. For holye fathers wyll at a tyme be as wanton as other poore menne / and smell after smockes for all their holy∣nesse. Holye Tomas Becket wold sumtyme for his pleasure make a iournaye of pylgry∣mage to the prymerose peerlesse of Staffor∣de / as his holye lyfe mencyoneth. He that shall narrowlye serche saynt Hie∣romes Epistles / shall fynde him sumwhat famylyar with Marcella. So shall he fynde Saynt Gregorye with Domicella / and also saynt Bonifacius the archebisshop of Ma∣gunce with Tecla and Lieba .ii. Englysshe women of his owne cuntre natyue. After the death of kynge Edgare this bredde moche trouble in Englande. For the great menne of the realme put out y• monkes by vyolence / and restored agayne the Prestes with their wyues / tyll soche tyme as a counsell was holden at Wynchestre. Where as the pre∣stes were agayne dyscharged / by vertu of a voyce which came from a rode in the freyter wall (here was propre packynge) or els from the deuyll speakynge in him. For in dede the deuyll loueth wele / and first sought out that holye kynde of chastyte for to bewtyfye ther¦with the Popes holye churche / & also to fyll hell. We rede of a watchynge deuyll (whe∣ther he were a prest or no that can I not tell)
but he begate Marlyne the great Prophete of Wales of an holye nonne of saynt Peters in Carmalyn / which was the dowter of the kynge of Demecia / to conferme this blessed storye with all. About a fourescore yeares after that was one Alwinus then bysshop also of Wynche∣stre accused of yll rule with Emme kyng Ed¦wardes mother / & so commytted to the exa∣mynacyon of the clergye in the yeare of oure Lorde a thousande & fyftye / but through spi∣rituall fauer he escaped it full well. As wyt∣nesseth Rhegino pruniensis / whan Charles the seconde Emprour returned agayne into Almanye from his warres with the Norm̄∣nes / he founde Limphardus the bysshop of Versell (which was his chefe councellour) so famylyar with his wyfe or empresse Ri∣charda / that he coude do no lesse than laye aduouterye to his charge. Remigius the bis∣shop of Dorcestre / was depryued of his bis∣shoprycke by Pope Alexander the seconde / bycause he was proued a prestes sonne. Ey∣ther had prestes wyues of their owne in tho∣se dayes / or els there was some other good workemanshyp a brode. As udaicus y• ar∣chebisshop of adeburge was daunsynge at mydnyght in a towne called Caua with her that he loued best / he sodenlye fell dead and neuer recouered it / in the yeare of oure Lorde a M.CCC.lxxxiii.
As that holye nonne laye a dyenge which brought forth at one byrthe / Petrus Lombat¦dus the master of the sentēces / Petrus Com¦mestor the master of the hystories / and Gra∣cianus monachus the master of the Popes lawes or decrees / and was admonisshed of her ghostlye father to be sorye for that aduo¦trye / for soth father (quoth she) I can not repent it / consyderynge that holye churche hath receyued soche thre lyghtes thereof. Iohan Eckius that impudēt warryour of an∣ticrist / and the onlye instructour of Englan¦de in that article and certen other / in the bo∣ke which he farelye made agaynst Martyne Luther / graūteth himselfe not to be Amarti∣ton / o a māne all without synne. He can not (he sayth) excuse himselfe / but that he hath bene as other menne are which hath not ob∣serued the chastyte of Hypolitus / for yf he ded we knowe the cōtrarye. yet will not that brent consciensed hypocrite / afferme it to be lawfull for a prest to marye in the lorde / so indurate is he to this houre. Though Benedict the .xii. Pope graun∣ted to Franciscus Petrarcha / which was a Canon of Padua / & archedeacon of Parma to take one Laureta to wyfe / retayninge styll his benefices / yet wolde he not afferme it lawfull that prestes myght marrye / but one∣lye by soch blynde dispensaciōs for his owne carnall purpose. For this was the chefe cau∣se of his beneuolence towarde him. Petrar∣cha
had a fayre syster in Auinion in the how∣se of his brother Ghirarde / whose felyship the holy father ded inwardlye couete / wor∣kynge manye feate polycies for it. He promi∣sed besydes this speciall prerogatiue vnto y• seyd Petrarcha / to make him a Cardinall / and to geue him greate goodes / in case he wolde bringe it to passe. Vnto whom as a manne fearynge God Petrarcha made this answer. The lorde of heuen forbydde (sayth he) that euer so fylthye a diademe shulde couer my head. And with this he departed the Popis court / and so fled into Italie / re∣compensynge there shortlye after by wrytin∣ge this vnworthye demaunde of the Pope / as testifyeth Philelphus. His impacable fu∣rye not yet qualyfyed / this holye father by manyfolde gyftes and rewardes made Ghi∣rarde his brother a mannefyt for his hande and so at the last abhominably corrupted the mayde. For the which the seyde Ghirarde hauynge great remorse of conscience / made himselfe a Charterose monke in Materne not farre from Marsilia / to make all to the deuyll. Petruo Ryarius a mynorite or graye fryre of Genua / and prest cardinall of saynt Six∣te in Rome / procured of Pope Sixtus y• fort his vncle by the helpe of his brother Hiero∣me / a dispensacyon for the whole how sholde of the cardinall of Saynt Lucie / to haue the fre occupyenge of buggerye boyes for the .iii.
hotter monthes of the yeare / with this clau¦se in the ende / Fat vt petitur. O fylthynes∣se no to be spoken / but that their hypocresye requireth it in these latter dayes / the ven∣geaūce of God most depelye hangynge ouer them. Nomore am I now ashamed to open their abhominacions / than they are yet styll with the dissemblynge tytle of their stynkin∣ge chastyte to couer them. The seyd religion¦s cardinall Peter spent within the space of two yeares .ii. hondred thousande florence in most prodigiouse lecherye. And dyed all rotted in that fylthynesse in the .xxviii. yea∣re of his age / the yeare of oure lorde  M .CCCC.lxxiiii. Petrus Mendosa the car∣dinall of Valencia in Spayne was not on∣lye satisfyed with y• quene vndre kyng Fer∣dinandus nose / besydes other whores / but he sent to the Pope for a lycence to occupye his owne sonne the marques of zanet. What rufflynge Pope Iulius made with the car∣dinall of Nantes in Brytayne for two yonge laddes which the French quene Anne cō∣mytted vnto him / it wolde abhorre honeste eares to heare. Pope Clement the .vii. was reported of some wryters to be a bastarde / a manqueller a posener / abawde / a symonyake / a Sodo∣myte / a periure / a rauysher / a sorcerer / a sa∣creleger / & a worker of all other myscheues / as Wynchestre is now in Englande / whose chast lyfe men maye cōiecture by his chekes
and ordre. Oh / that the earthe open not at soche wretchednesse. I thinke in Sodome and Gomorre were neuer soche prodigiouse kyndes of fylthynesse as are yet in that spi∣ritualte / yet will they be styll a chast genera¦cyon and holde marryage for synne. The sy∣ster of Alexander farnesius (which is now saynt Peters vycar / yf he hath anye / vndre the name of the .iii. Paule) was at this nar∣raw poynt with Pope Leo the .x. no longar to be his owne swete lemanne vnlesse he wold make her brother a cardinall after his wyfe was dead / which was than but his scrybe and cōueyar. In all hast possyble was this graunted and perfourmed / he constitu∣te bysshop of Hostyense. These and soche other lyke examples of holye churche are the frutes of Pantolabus holye ghost / that Luther hath bannysshed by his manyfolde heresyes. And in the sted of them hath he brought in maryage / whom Pantolab{us} hath dyffyned to be synne here / though it be the clere institucyon of God? But parauenture Pantolab{us} God is not the God that made marryage / and therefore he dare do that we∣le ynough. A mysterye. 1 Next after him Is his chefe lym. 2 One Melanchtonus. Nequaquam bonus.
3 Euanuerun in cogitationibus sut. . The openinge. 1. IN this processe folowynge is Pantola∣bus compelled to playe Myhell make shyft. No longar will his wittes serue him to cōtinue forth his genealogie by anye maner waye of naturall propagacyon. But now he boroweth a lymme of him / & an other lymme of him. Now seketh he to fatche in that cōmer in and that captayne a brode. Philip Melanchton is here brought in for a lymme of Martyn Luther / and after that Peter Franke for a lymme of Lambert / yet were they neuer cuntre menne. Oecolam∣padius with zwinglius is made a cōmer in∣to helpe here at a pynche / o is Barnes with Garade and Hierome. And poore Iohan Frith is fatt out a farre of / to playe the sym∣ple captayne. So that we are lyke ere we co∣me to the ende / to close germanes lyppes / which neuer came togyther (they saye) by seuen myles. First he begāne his hygh the∣torykes in subtyle tropes of allegorye with Blynde obstinacie / Dame ignoraunce / De∣bate / Ambicion / and so forth. And when that wolde no longar serue him / he stept to the playne storye / and brought forth out of that / Wyclef / Husse / and Luther by name. As mo∣che agre they .ii. in one veyne of speakynge / as doth fyre and water / which be of a con∣trarye nature. And therefore we are lyke to haue a wyse conclusyon. yet yf all other thin¦ges
fayl / we shall haue the frutes of an folysshe ydle brayne. 2 Now cometh he to the declaracyon of the two subtyle verses which went afore / wherin ye shall fynde moche good lernyng / yf ye marke them wele whan he hath expow¦ned them. One Melanchtonus (he sayth) nequaquam bonus / and he sheweth nomore of him. Is not here thynke you a lompe of good doctryne: Doth not the prelates of En¦glande moche to the common welthe of the realme / to sende forth soche an wholsom tea∣cher: yes marrye I trow / and they wolde be sorye to sende forth anye other. Here is Phi∣lip Melanchion (whom all Christendome commendeth for his most excellent leruyn¦ge) detected for an heretyque of this bray∣nelesse hypocrite and blasphe mouse beastlye babler / non artycles of heresye expressed. But neuer the worse is the fayre fyne golde / though the fylthye ratte beshyteth it. For nought is it not that this is done in Latyne he shuld not els apere so well lerned. Sum∣what we must haue to sprede forth oure shyr∣tes with / & to haue oure phylacteris seane / all were not els worth a fart. But yf Nequa quam bonus / with insipiēs colonus / had be put to Hōtyngton{us} / it had made a better so∣nus. O insipient papistes / that ye haue no∣more wytt but to vttre soche folyshnesse. All the worlde maye se by this and soche other / how vayne ye are in youre stodyes /
and soydle in youre fantasyes. 3 The scripture that ye haue brought forth here / out of saynt Paules Epistle to the Ro∣manes / Euanuerunt in cogitationibus suis is as ryghtlye youre owne good as is possy∣ble. For yt is spoken there vnto them that withholde the truth of God in vnryghtous∣nesse / as you do here in this iest of yours / and as doth youre whole popysshe genera∣cyon / becōmynge all vayne in youre though∣tes / & hauynge youre folysshe hartes so dar∣kened. But I maruele sore whan ye redde that chapter / whye ye marked not this clau∣se folowynge. Propterea tradidit vos Deus in passiones ignominie &c. For youre obsty∣nate frowardnesse hath the sorde geuen you ouer into most shamefull lustes / and suffred you to worke fylthynesse amonge yourselues leauynge the naturall vse of women. This hath he geuen you as a due rewarde of your errour / for that ye haue turned his verite to a lye / and serued the creature rathe than y• creator or maker. This therfore doth rather perteyne to you than to Melanchton: for yo contempne marryage / & not he / you are the Sodomites / and not he. you are the abhomi∣nable ydolaters / sensynge styll stockes and stones / and not he. It is you most execrable papistes that are there now noted to be full of iniquite / malyce / fornicacyon /  / falshede / enuye / murther / contencyon / frau∣de / frowardnesse / and so forth as foloweth
there in course / and not these godlye men. A mysterye. 1 Next after this vvhelpe Came in to helpe. 2 One Oecolampadius / Vvith his brother zvinglius. ¶The openinge. 1. KNowlege I thynke verye small hath Pantolabus of y• godlye lerned men∣ne whom here he rayleth vpon in his folysshe iest / and that apereth by the vndis∣crete ordre therof. For here he reporteth Oe¦colampadius and zwinglius to come after Melanchton in the mayntenaunce of that doctryne. Where as they were auncyēt men whan Melanchton was but a chylde / & we∣re promoters of the Lordes veryte whan he knewe nothynge of yt. And therfore the mā∣ne is wele ouerseane in the matters he ta∣keth in hande. Before was Melanchton a lymme of Luther / and now he is become a whelpe / but we knowe not wherof. Dogges / cattes / and all will be lytle ynough ere we haue done I feare me / to make a wys ende of oure genealogye. We fare syke him that putt to his cart both his bore and his sowe with pygges / whan he had not horse ynough to drawe home his haruest. Salomon calleth you the wylye whespes of the foxe which hath destroyd the vynes. Hieremye telleth
you that ye haue broken downe the Lordes byne yarde / and troden vndre youre fete his pleasunt possessyon / makynge his lande a wyldernesse. I maruele therfore ye regestre them not here for heretyques. Both Christ & Iohan Baptist doth call you adders whel∣pes and the fylthye frye of the serpent / yet haue you no grace to beleue yt. 2 Ioannes Decolampadius is the first of the two that ye here blaspheme / which was borne in the lande of Sueuia. This was a manne of incomparable lernynge / & a most pure professour of the Gospell. An excellent Oratour / Poete / Philosopher / Historiane / Lawer / and doctor of diuynite / throughlye expert in the Latyne / Greke / Hebrue / and Chaldie / whose innocēt lyfe no manne cou∣de iustlye reproue. In Bononie / Hyltprunne / Heydelberge / Basyle / and Augusta was he both a common reader and also an open prea¦cher / not without great name of his audito∣rye. He translated out of the Greke into the Latyne / manye workes of saynt Iohan Chri¦sostome / saynt Lyrillus / Athanasi{us} / Dama∣scen{us} / Theophilactus / & other. More than lvi. volumes vpon the scripturs with other treatyses compyled he / which are greatlye cōmended of them that be lerned. Moche a do he had with Iohan Faber a Suffragan and fryre / with Eckius / Empser / Cochleus Fysher of Rochestre / Latomus / Clichtoue{us} / Pyrkeimerus / Pelargus / and diuerse other
great warryours of Antichristes host / whom he answered by Apologyes / besydes his con∣tynuall conflictes with the Anabaptistes / & other sectes. At the last he departed hen∣ce most godlye in the .liii. yeare of his age / and in the yeare from Christes incarnacyon a M. D. and .xxxi. euen the verye bewtye of Christen lernynge / whom Erasmus an other lyght of oure age / called a verye pure thelogyane. 3 Husdricus zwingli{us} borne in the lande of Heluecia / was a manne also of moste syn∣gular erudicyon & equall with y• other in all feates of lernynge. In all that he ded in his cōmon lecturs and preachynges / he stodyed to be brefe and playne. Neuer was ther anye that euer kynt vp more surelye / nor that sent agayne the aduersaryes dartes more sharpe¦lye. He that shall rede his boke De prouidē∣cia D / besydes his other .xxxvi. workes / shall saye yf he be lerned / that he is equall with the best that euer sett penne to paper. Mche labour he toke to extyrpe soche vy∣ces as the pple of custome were geuen vn∣to. For he which at the last he suffred most cruell death in the .xlviii. yeare of his age / a M.D. and .xxxi. from Christes incarna∣cyon / the .xi daye of Octobre. Of them was he slayne / cutt in peces / and brent in defen∣dynge the common welthe of his cyte / for whom he had afore taken wonderfull peynes to brynge them into the waye of ryghtuous∣nesse.
o these are the two bretherne that Pantolabus here rayleth vpon in his rusty∣call ymes without lernynge / wytt / and all godlynesse. Myght we not (thynke you) saye to him with Apelles? Come downe ser sow∣ter / and holde ye styll to youre last. Be con∣tented with youre homblye occupacyon / and meddle not with that which is beyonde you∣re compas. A mysterye. 1 These praters of dyuynite vvith their affynyte. hath sought about 2 The vvorlde through out 3 For vngracyoue teachers to be their preachers. 4 Conuenerunt in vnum aduersus do∣minum & aduersus Christum eius. psal. 2.

doctor Molle / & soche other / made their open complayntes that in .xxviii. yeares stodye they coude not vnderstande Dons. And as for Christes diuynite / I will beare them recorde / they knewe yt nothynge at all. I thynke these for that tyme in their dispu∣tacyons and lecturs were Iolye pratlers of diuynite. And their frutes wolde declare a great sort of them to be lyttle better now. Is not here (thynke you) in this worke of Pan∣tolabus / a plesaūt patche of diuynite: It is no maruele though so noble a clarke as he complayneth of pratynge / whan his selfe pratleth here so folyshlye. youre draffyshe diuynes / as Dons / Thomas / Guido / Gy∣les / Ockam / Baconthorpe / Durande / Ga∣briel / Dorbel / and a thousande more / hath done lyttle other these .iii. hondreth yeares but establyshe lyes in hypocresye to falsyfye the scripturs / yet were they no praters of diuynite but good doctors of holye churche. O beastlye Baalamytes / lerne ones to be godlye wyse. 2 What you & youre affynite haue sought the worlde ouer / and what ye seke yet syll / yt is knowne in this age to manye / yet are ye not ashamed of yt. ye haue sought out all the sorceryes of the Gentiles / to fyll the peple with their supersticyons. ye haue robbed y• Sophisters of their subtyle conueyaunces / to begyle y• poore innocent sowles. The wy∣lye inuencyons of ogycke / the craftye co∣lours
of Rhetoryke / & the preuye practyses of philosophie haue ye gathered togyther / to deceyue all y• worlde that knoweth not your craftes. Not one slayght is there nor cast of good legerdemayne that anye iugler hath / but ye haue sought yt oute for auauntage. Soche subtyle sekers ye are yet to this daye: What ye haue sought in other mennis how∣ses / hawles / stabyls / barnes / butteryes / ky∣chys / chambers / parlours / and sumtyme in the good mannys bedde / I thynke there be fewe alyue but knoweth. There is not a poo¦re wenche that taketh wages / but ye must haue y• tent part for preuye tythes. There is not a labourer which lyueth by the sweate of his browes / but ye must haue a patche ther∣of / though his chyldren shulde famyshe at home. youre sekynge about y• worlde through oute is an other maner of matter than the trauayle of those godlye menne hath bene / whom ye here accuse in youre ydelnesse. 3 If euer there were in the worlde tea∣chers more vngracyouse than you / I maue∣le / or yf there euer were more peruerse prea∣chers / I wondre. What other hath bene you¦re doctryne afore tyme / but that the peple shul'd beleue as holye churche doth teache them? That is to saye that the Pope was Gods vycar in earthe / & the head of that ho¦lye churche. That he coude not erre / & that his curse was most to be feared. That pur∣gatorye was peynefull / pylgrimages whol∣som /
masses merytoryouse / diryges medicy∣nable / holye water good for spretes / & soche other wretched wytcherye. All the odye of youre bysshoppes / practyse of youre prestes / dilygence of youre relygiouse / and labour of youre vnyuersytees / was about non other thynge / but to maynteyne soche beggerlye baggage. And yt apereth by Wynchestre / Bonner / Tonstall / & soche other / that ye se∣ke yet non other thynge els. The solempne declarayōs of Seyton & Tolwyn shall yet stande forth for wytnesses / yf nede be / besy∣des the workes of Standysshe & Pantolab{us}. O most shamelesse hypocrites / how dare ye be so bolde to report other menne for vngra∣cyouse teachers / your selues offerynge so vn¦gracyouse documētes to y• worlde Remoue first of all y• great beame of your owne / ere ye take y• small mote from your neyber. He that shall conferre your teachynges wt y• worde of God / shall fynde them vngracyouse ynough 4 The scripture here alleged for your vn∣gracyouse purpose: Conuenerūt in  ad∣ursus domin & aduersus Chrisium eius / maye saye that he is full vngracyouslye han¦dled. Dauid spake it in prophecye agaynst y• heythē tyraūtes / that shuld withstande both y• lord & his worde. These (sayth he) come to¦gyther agaynst God & his Christ. Into this myschefe fell at y• last y• cruell counsell also of y• Iewes / y• bishopes / pharisees / lawers / scribes / & doctours wt the vndiscrete rewlers peruerted by thē. And euer sens yt hath ben
your bloodthurstye generacyon / styll persecu¦tyng Christ in his faythfull members. They are y• false peple that ymagyne vayne thyn∣ges. They are the tyraūtes that withstande gods veryte / burnyng / hāgyng / & drownyng y• poore innocentes for yt. Who are y• kynges of y• earth but they? The other beare onlye y• name / & are but their bochers & slaues. But this shuld Pantolab{us} haue also consydered. Qui habitat in celis / irridebiteos / & tanqū¦vas figuli confringet eos. He that sitteth in heuen shall scorne their practyses in y• drede∣full daye / & dashe them in peces lyke an ear∣then vessell that is throwne agaynst an har∣de wall. Let not those termagauntes thynke so to escape y• great vengeaūce of his indig∣nacyon. For there yt doth abyde thē in dede. Though they take here their vayne pleasurs for y• tyme / yet is not y• iudgemēt farre of / ney¦ther slepeth their dānacyon / but is redye to lyght vpon thē wt vengeaūce. ¶A mysterye 1 And here in this londe Certayne they fonde. 2 Vvhich by and bye Dyd them applye. 3 For to sett forth Thynges nothynge vvorth. 4 And preached openlye Both treason and heresye. ¶The openinge. 1.
MAuele yt is to me / yf these men sou∣ghte oute vngracyouse teachers in Englande / that they founde not out Standysshe and Pantolabus / Bonner and Wynchestre. I thynke they coude not haue founde moche worse yf they had sought the worlde all ouer. No / though they had foun∣de out the deuyll himselfe. For in their doc∣tryne is y• true Christen fayth blasphemed / the sacred scripturs perueted moste wret∣chedlye / the seruauntes of God mayned / the peple of the worlde deluded / the pryce of oure redempcyon contempned / and all Ea∣bylonishe beggerye for them persuaded. yea / Standyshe was not ashamed ones in his fylthye preachynge to make Christes blood no better than the blood of a swyne. There are yet in London a greate sort lyuynge that harde him yet is he a lewde preacher styll / and not condempned of the bysshoppes for an heretyque. There shall no soche come in the Genalogie of heresye. Pantolab{us} hath here full honorably beshytt the scripturs / and full lyke a worshypfull gentylman of y• Popes churche. And so hath he putt them forth a brode vndre the kynges pryuylege. Ad imprimendum solum / both by Robert Wyer and also by Iohan Redman / which care not what they do for moneye. yet is he not founde out for an vngracyouse teacher. But yf he had ryghtlye taught the Gospell / he had bene founde out ere this tyme.
2 What labours ye haue taken and how busylye ye haue applyed yt to set vp the kyn∣gedome of the deuyll by all madde mastryes of ydolatrye / the Chronycles declareth at large. And how ye sturre about ye now with olde rotten poles and sparres to holde vp youre holye mother for fallynge / we are not so blynde but we perseyue yt. Prouyde ye for necessaryes apace / & se that she droppe not awaye sodenlye in the feuer she hath now a dayes. Bynde vp her head for sweruynge / lappe vp her bodye warme for sursetynge / and prouyde her a cawdell of calues egges to recouer her agayne yf yt maye be. Luther hath febled her sore / so hath Oecolampadi{us} and zwinglius. Barnes here in Englande was not all behynde with his part / nomore was Iohan Frith and Tyndale. But hap∣pye ye are that Thomas Crōwell lyued not / for he had by this tyme made her no verye beuityfull gentyll woman. Wele / now ye ha∣ue gotten the ouerhande of her enemyes / ap∣plye ye apace whyle ye haue layser / to set her vp agayne. Be now no sluggardes in youre holye water makynge / nor yet in youre sen∣synges and goynge processyon: ye shall fyn∣de my lorde Gardyner of Wynchestre / & my lorde Bonner of London with other good pre¦lates of the realme verye fauorable and as∣sisent vnto you / so that ye meddle not with the Gospell. Therfore applye ye apace / & se there be founde in ye no slackenesse.
3 The precyouse worthynesse of thynges out by your Egypciall generacyon / is so∣ne valued. I report me here to this worthye genealogye of yours. Forsoth yt is honora∣ble ware and worthye to haue soche a Poete for y• author. It is no maruele though these newe bokes now a dayes be thynges nothyn¦ge worth. For they bring neyther tythes nor offerynges / deuocyōs nor trētals / purgato∣rye pens nor pyssages. Ther are more swete profyghtes to be pycked oute of one Sarum masse boke / than out of them all: yea / God saue Sermones discipuli / wt the portas / pro∣cessyoner / & olde festiuall. For a moch better worlde was yt whan they were vsed / than yt is now a dayes. It was a good worlde wt pre∣stes / whan they stodyed nothynge els but fry¦re Albert de secretis mulierū / & to fatche in their tythes & other profyghtes. Longe was t ere Iohan Maior in Parys a great lerned manne / coude proue by naturall reason & by the scripturs that watchyng spretes myght begett wemen with chylde / as one of them ded the nōne of wales that was Marlynes mother: Was not this thynke you a good ver¦tuouse stodye & sumwhat worth / when it was ones brought to lyght: They haue sett forth manye of these good workes / lyke good ver∣tuouse fathers and profytable workemen / yet hath fewe or non founde sawte in them. 4 Sumwhat meaneth Pantolab{us} here by this heresye and treason that was so open¦lye
preached. But I trust he will discoue nō of his owne affynite / though manye of them were hanged for them at y• rysynge vp in the Northe. Doctor Baylye in Sothfolke wrou∣ghte great myracles by syr Roger Wenfor∣thes dowter to auaūce the great ladye of Ip¦pes wyche. Doctor Bockynge lyke wyse ded wonderfull feates at Caunterberye in kent by Elyzabeth Berton to sett vp a newe pyl∣grimage at Court vp strete. Doctor Cron∣keorne had certen reuelaciōs of a newe kyn¦gedome that was cōmynge vpon this clause of Te Deū / Aperuisti credētibus regna ce∣lorū. And preached thē in dyuerse townes of Easisexe as y• monasteryes were in suppres∣synge / by y• vertu of this text. Temp{us} faci¦di domine / dissipauerūt legem tu. It is ty∣me lorde to sturre about y•. For yf thu tarrye moche longar / y• heretyques will marre all. Doctor Pyckerynge & other prelates ded lyt¦tle other for .2. years space / but moue the pre¦sts of the North to prouoke y• peple in their lent confessyons to the pylgrimage of grace agaynst y• kynge & his counsell. Besydes y• propre feates that were done by doctor Mac¦ketell / y• vycar of Lowthe / Reynold{us} of She∣ne / y• charterouse monkes / y• obseruaūt fryers & dyuerse other that were hanged & quarte∣red. But these will not Pantolab{us} accuse for preachers of heresye & treason / because their doctryne doth please him well / & specyallye because y• pope hath newly canonysed thē for his sayntes.
A mysterye. 1 The first captayne Of this false trayne. 2 Vvas one Iohan Frith / Vvhich had no pyth. 3 Of lernynge nor vvytt Not vvorth a nytt. 4. Via stulti recta in oculis eius. psal. 12. The openinge. 1. NOt one of these scysmatiques afore re∣hersed / coude Pantolabus fynde in his hart to appoynt oute for a captayne. yet were they of a false sedicyouse trayne both of heresye and treason / as his selfe is yet syll with other of that affynite. The lorde Datsye was in those dayes a myghtye great captayne. So was the lorde Husseye. So we∣re syr Robert Constable / syr Thomas Per∣cye / syr Iohan Bulmer / syr Steuen Hamer∣ton / syr George Lumlaye / with Rafe Bul∣met / Nycolas Tempest / & a great sort more. Robert Aske was in that pylgrimage of gra∣ce for y• Popes holye churche no small doar / though he had but one eye. Nomore was cap¦tayne Cobler / that valeaūt George on hor∣se backe with his Lyncolne shere bowes and baggepypes: yet are they not founde fytt to occupye a rome in this noble Genealogye. Manye spirituall captaynes also and wyse counsellers were at the same selfe tyme ve∣rye
busye to promote that ghostlye quarell forwarde. As Iames Locherell the prior of Gysburgh / Wyllyam Wytlesse the prior of Brydlyngton / Adam Sedbar Abbot of Gar∣beleye / Wyllyam Thyrske abbot of Fenleye the abbot of Oborne / the abbot of Sawleye / the abbot of Whawleye / the abbot of Glas∣tenerye / the abbot of Redynge / the abbot of Lolchestre / and the prior of Lenton not far∣re from Nothyngham. Besydes that was do∣ne at Walsyngham in Northfolke / by syr Ny¦colas Mylam a Chanon / George Gysborow fryre Peckoc / and other more. But all these captaynes were out of Pantolabus remem∣braunce at this tyme. 2 Onlye is poore Iohan Frith a captay∣ne sounde out here to his purpose / because he was to the Pope a capitall enemye. Though Pantolabus be but a fole / he knoweth what he wotteth wele ynough. I warande you he hath no worse opinyon of all these former captaynes / than hath the holye father of Ro¦me. That is to saye / though they were by∣headed / hanged / & quartered / yet dyed they full vertuouse menne / as ded holye Thomas Beckett for the lybertees of holye churche. By this maye ye se that yt is not all one to dye forholye churche and to dye for the Gos∣pell. For they that dye for holye churche are holye sayntes and martyrs / where as they that dye for the Gospell are but heretyques and trayters. But what this will apere in y•
latter iudgement / that daye shall declare / when no worldlye polycies will helpe. This poore yonge manne Iohan Frith / which is here cōtempned for the veruytees sake / maye chaunce at that daye as the membre with y• head / with Christ to iudge y• truthes aduer∣saryes / for folowynge him in the same perse∣cucyon. For an offyce yt is to a certen sort be∣longynge. But sure I am that they are not those which lyue here voluptuouslye. Than must yt nedes be they that suffre all wron∣ges here in that verytees cause. 3 The wyfe man sayth / that they are tho∣se whom y• worlde had sumtyme in dirisyon / thynkynge their doctryne madde folyshnes∣se and their latter endes withoute honour. yet are they rekened amonge the chyldren of God / & their porcyon is plentyfull amonge the holye sayntes. Of this vnlerned hypo∣crite and braynelesse babler / is Iohan Frith noted to be without pyth of lernynge & wyte Where as the contrarye is knowne to his whole generacyon / which neuer were yet able to confute his boke of purgatorye agenst Rastell / More / and Rochestre / besydes his other workes. The veryte hath yet victorye at his hande / though he for a tyme be throw∣ne vndre the aulter / there callynge for a iust reuengement of that vnpytefull violence so cruellye here ministred vnto him. What py∣the of wytt and lernynge Pantolabus had whan he wrote this Genealogie / yt is wele
perseyued of them that hath redde yt / yf they were not as he is / all wytlesse and graceles∣se. Scarselye worth a nytt is the best verse therof / to him that shall seke eyther wytt or lernynge. But as the sayinge is / draffe is good ynough for swyne / and dyrtye puddyn∣ges for dogges. As good as the best is this fylthye baggage for the Papistes / which se∣keth nothynge els but errours and lyes in hypocrisye. 4 In his allegacyon of scripture / Panto∣labus shulde seme neyther to be wytty nor lerned. For in both his cappyes imprinted by Iohan Redman and Robert Wyer / he no∣teth yt to be in the .xii. Psalme of Dauid / and yt is not there / but in the .xii. chapter of Salomons Prouerbes. There is this text in dede. Via stulti recta in oculis eius. Loke what a fole taketh in hande / that thynketh he onlye wele done. A verye folyshe syght hath Pantolabus in Genealogies to take y• father for y• sonne. Of a lykelyhode he drea∣med that he was at Mattens whan he was at masse / by takynge of Dauid for Salomon By the orderyng of his scripturs / he semeth better lerned in his portas or Masse boke / than in the sacred Byble. No where had that text bene better bestowed / than vpon his owne precyouse bodye / yf he had seane him∣selfe ryghtlye. For by his shadowe we maye trace out an ydyote / moche more by his per∣sone / & most of all by his doltyshe doctryne
here ministred. In the same chapter is this text also: verte impios & non erunt / domus ustorum permanebit. Turne ouer the wyc∣ked / and they are nomore seane / but the buyl¦dynge of the ryghtouse shall neuer perishe. Frith shall be cōmended for his godlye wys∣dome / whan Pantolabus shall be reputed a presumptuouse fole. Abominable are deceyt∣full lyppes before the Lorde / but they that la¦bour for the truthe doth please him greatlye. A mysterye. 1 He dyd saye playne There ded not remayne. 2 Ryaye present In the blessed sacrament. 3 Os iusti pascitur imperitia. Pro. 15. ¶The openinge. 1. ODyouse vnto Pantolabus is Iohan Frith aboue all other / and that ape∣reth by this. Though he hath afore here accused Wyclef / Husse / Luther / Me∣lanchton / Oecolampadius / and zwinglius for heretyques / yet hath he layde agaynste them non artycles of heresye. But now in a great fume he layeth to Iohan Frithes char¦ge the sacramēt of the aultre / and that with no small circumstaūce. Manye menne thyn∣keth that this hote enterpryse of his / is mo∣re for the losse that he and soche other hath sustayned in dyrge pens / sowle grotes / mas∣se
offerynges / trētals / monthmyndes / year∣myndes / and soche lyke / than for anye other deryon. That is the comberouse collyk that pangeth him & his generacyon daylye at the verye hart roe / & that maketh them so malancholye / madde / and modye agaynst heretyques. They are not cōtented that Io∣han Frith was so playne in his wrytynges concernynge that matter / wherin all their commodyte and profyghtes lyeth enclosed. Had he medled with anye other thynge els / he had not so fore displeased them. For yf that ones were taken awaye / small substaū∣ce wold remayne vnto them / towardes their spirituall mayntenaunce in pryde / whore∣dom / slouthe / ydelnesse / glottonye / buggerye and soch other beastlye frutes of their vn∣cyons and shauynges. 2 Wonderfullye haue they busyed them∣selues to holde vp that buyldynge of theirs. That holye Masse or sacrifice for the quye∣ke and the dead / patched togyther by so ma∣nye holye Popes / with so manye ceremonyes dysgysynges / syghtes / instrumentes / gy∣nes / legerdemaynes / turnynges / beckyn∣ges / dreamynges / dottynges / mowynges / gapynges / breathynges with ho he haue at all / cryenges / crossynges / doppynges / dos∣synges / blessynges / breakynges / deowryn∣ges / syppynges / rynsynges / thombe lyckyn∣ges / & manye other toyes besydes. All their wyttes / labour / disygence / and stodye haue
they with Demetrius occupyed / to prepare stronge bulwerkes for this shryne of Dya∣na. Afterthat their Pope had ones optayned of Phocas the false emprour to be head of y• churche. By the craftye practyses of the mō∣kes / Paschasi{us} / Berno / Guido / Humbert{us} / Gulmundus / Algerus / Rogerus / Lanfran∣cus / Anslmus / and soche other / was realy∣te adioyned to the sacrament. Than were vnyuersytees founded euerye where by mon¦kes also to vpholde that newe buylded but∣teras. Than stode forth Peter the Lombar∣de or the Master of their sentences / which was begotten / bredde / and borne of an holye whore / a nonne I shulde saye / vndre the sa∣cred vowe of chastyte / and he gaue vnto yt transubstanciacyon. Than folowed trans∣mutacyon / transicyon / and transaccidenta∣cyon / but not transsyguracyon yet to this daye. Than ded Pope Innocent the .iii. of that name make yt Accidens sine subiecto / Tho∣mas of Aqyne supportynge that doctryne by his doltyshe diuynite. Iohan Parys and other wolde haue added vnto yt Impana∣cyon of y• worde / but that was reiected anon for daungers therevpon ensewynge. After that came in ydemptyte / realyte / formaly∣te / materyalyte / propryete / veracyte / absolu∣te beynge / multiplicacyon / vnyon / diffynita∣cyon / essenciacyon / vbiquite fyguralite / sym¦bolycalite / naturalyte / potencialite / perso∣nalyte /
presencialyte / proporcionalite / perti∣cipalite / habitualite / virtualite / dymencio∣nalite / substancialite / deificalite / carnalite corporalite / modalite / supposytalite / yposta∣ticalite / and a great sort more amonge their Sentencioners and Scolistes. Than was y boxed / pyxed / and tabernacled / & so bor∣ne forth in processyon with torche / lyght / ban¦ner / crosse / candelsyck / cope / & canape / with knelynge and crowchynge / manye wonder∣full myracles folowynge / as was seane at Lynos / Parys / Calys / Brucels / Schiedam / and in manye other places els. And so was yt clerelye altred from Christes institucyon / and became throughlye the abominacyon of desolacyon / as wytnesseth Iohan Wyclef in his .iii. chapter de Eucharistia. Than had the bisshoppes at their handes their Sophi∣sters and Summystes / their Sentēcyoners and Canonistes with all supersiciouse sub∣tyltees to defende yt for a blessed sacramēt. And whan that lowsye lernynge wolde not serue them / than had they vpon their sydes to dispute with agaynst y• heretyques / both sweedes and halters / fyre and faggottes / as they haue yet styll to this houre. 3 I wolde that the text which Pantolab{us} bringeth in here out of Salomons Prouer∣bes / to proue that Christes bodye is reallye present in the blessed sacrament / were dily∣gentlye marked of the reader. It is not the∣se / De stusti pascitur imperitia / as Pantol∣bus
hath here layed it forth. But it is in that xv. chapter. De stultorum pascetur imper∣tia / yf ye take their olde text. The mouthe of fooles shall befedde with all folyshnesse. Of a lykelyhode Pantolab{us} hath some priuy¦lege of the Pope / that he maye at his plea∣sur peruert the scripturs in the defence of ho¦lye churche. yet proueth not this peruerted text that Christ is reallye present in the sa∣crament. But in dede it declareth what Pan¦tolabus is / both reallye / naturallye / formal∣lye / and substanciallye / and so doth in a ma∣ner all the whole chapter besydes. Sone af∣ter the begynnynge therof / is soche an other: lyke clause. De fatuorum ebullit stultitiam. The mouth of lewde fooles boyleth out fo∣lyshe bablynges / as are the Poeticall verses of Pantolabus boke here / and all the ynke horne termes also of their doctors afore re∣hersed here for their blessed sacramēt. More fytlye had this clause of the same chapter bene applyed to that sacrament as it is now vsed. Victime impiorum abominabiles Do∣mino. Abhominable to y• Lorde are the sacri∣fyces of the wycked / where as the prayer of the ryghtouse is acceptable. Fylthye is the waye of the vngodlye / but he that foloweth ryghtousnesse is in Gods fauer. For whye y• ceremonyes therof are the Popes & not his. The brekefast is the prestes alone / and no communyon of Christes peple to knytt them vp togyther as members into his mysticall bodye.
A mysterye. 1 The flesshe and blood And lyuelye food. 2 And onlye vvelthe Of oure soule helthe. 3 Qul manducat hunc panem, viuet in aeternum. Ioan. 6. ¶The openinge. 1. PRoudelye styll pratleth this popishe Poete / accusynge Iohan Frith for not graūtynge Christes reall presence in their sacrament. And here he cōuerteth his fantasyed realyte into Christes fleshe and blood / callynge it the lyuelye fode of y• sowle Godlye wyse was Iohan Frith / and so shall he fynde it in the latter daye / in that he wol∣de not attribute vnto Christ that thynge / wt is not founde in y• scripturs. A popishe lyue∣rye is that realite of theirs / sophisticallye borrowed of Aristotles logyck. He wolde in no case be accursed of the mouthe of God for addynge soche beggerye to his worde. Ra∣ther ded he (good creature) offre his bodye to the fyre. I thynke not the contrarye of I¦han Frith / but yf their sacrament had bene Christes as it is the Popes / in the colours it is in now / he had graunted vnto it moche more than he ded. Christes fleshe is no so∣che pouetrye / nor his blood soche māmetrye / as their mangye myracles hath made it.
For yf their corruptyble breade were that lyuelye fode of sowle / than had all they pe∣ryshed / which hath not so outwardlye re∣ceyued it afore tyme. As Adam / Noe / Abra∣ham / Moyses / Dauid / Helias / with all the other fathers which dyed afore Christ. They receyued both his bodye and blood / els had they not bene saued. For saynt Paule doth saye that all they and we haue eaten of one spirituall meate and drōcke of one spirituall drincke / one harde rocke ministrynge it vn∣to ve both. In sprete & veryte (sayth Christ) shall the true worshippers worshippe him / and not in outwarde thynges that are seane with the eye / for they remayne onlye to the false worshippers or ydolaters. 2 Neyther haue youre Realyte power to make youre blessed sacrament Christes fles∣she nor yet his blood. Neyther can ye therby proue it oure lyuelye food nor yet oure ow∣les helthe / though ye a thousande tymes put it thervnto. For so moche as it cometh not from y• expresse worde of God / but from the fylthye doctryne of youre Philosophers / which were non other but fylthye ydolaters. Rathe shulde it seme therfore to conuert it into an ydoll to oure sowles destruccyon / than into Christes fleshe to oure sowles cō∣solacyon. A lyuelye fode it maye wele be vn∣to you which are fedde therwith daylye at youre austers / but wele I wote in that kynde it is non vnto vs in y• churches bodye which
haue no part therof. An onlye welthe it maye be vnto youre generacyon which take the swete profytes therof / & lyueth therby in all boluptuouse pleasurs of ydelnesse. But how it shulde be the helthe of youre sowles in that kynde of clowtynge / that can I not we∣le tell you. Wele I wote it is neyther wel∣the nor helthe vnto vs. For a great vndoyn∣ge hath it bene to the comonwelthe / and is yet a most ruynouse decaye of the peples sow¦le helthe / the eternall father redressel it. ye will saye parauenture ye make it Christes fleshe by the speakynge of his worde vnto it Christ neuer taughte yow to preache his worde in a foren language to a thynge that is dumme / but to the lyuynge peple in their natyue language / that they myght beleue and be saued. He bad you distribute that bre∣de vnto other / and not to slaffe it vp youre selues. He commaunded also the peple to ea∣te it / but in no case to worship it. Neuer was it worshipped in the churche / tyll it had you∣re Realyte / which Christ neuer graunted to youre breathynge. 3 The scripture that is here alleged oute of the sixt of Iohan. Qui manducat hunc panem / viuet in eternum / condempneth the whole doctrine of Pantolab{us} madde meters here / both by the sequele of the same chap. and also by the opynion of all the olde doc∣tors which nameth it a spirituall eatynge. In all that processe doth Christ reproue the
Capernaytes or carnall hearers of his wor∣de / requirynge a beleue of them that will be saued. For at that tyme nor yet of a yeare af∣ter was not that holye supper of his institu∣ted. Christ there admonished both his owne disciples and y• Capernaytes not to labour for the meate that perisheth with the bellye / but for that which endureth into the lyfe euerlastynge which is his eternall worde. And whan they grodged at his heaueulye aduertysementes / he declared vnto them what he ment by that eatynge / fayeng. Qui credit in me / habet vitam eternam. He that beleueth on me / hath the lyfe euerlastynge. As who shulde saye / that there to eate / is to beleue accordynge to his worde. Whan Chri¦ste after that he had declared hymselfe to be the breade of lyfe / and that his fleshe was meate and his blood verye drincke / and that they which ded eate him shuld lyue for euer. He gaue them this for a full cōclusyon of the vnderstandynge of that eatynge and drinc∣kynge. Spiritus est qui viificat / caro non prodest quicquā. It is onlye the sprete that quyckeneth / the carnall eatynge profyteth nothynge at all. For the bisshoppes behelde him / Iudas ded kysse him / and the cruell Ie¦wes towched his bodye / yet were they for that neuer the better. Nomore than the pre∣stes are yet to this houre / which (as they saye) do daylye receyue him with their mou∣the / eate him with their lyppes / and teare
him with their teathe. A mysterye. 1 O braynelesse nodye Christ sayd my bodye 2 Is verelye meate For manne to eate. 3 Caro mea vere est cibus, &c. Ioan. 6. The openinge. 1. QVycke is Pantolabus in his matters now / & quauereth in his quybybles at large. He cutteth his crotchettes as short as chyldes dyrt / that they shulde tonne rounde on his tonge. Now is Iohan Frith a braynelesse nodye / because he hath not written to his mynde. But what a wyt∣lesse wrangeler is he / and a dodypoll dawe pat / that thus will talke with a dead man∣ner. A cōmon custom is it amonge the vnler∣ned papistes / onlye to inueye agaynst them that are gone. Neuer will they meddle with them which are alyue / vnlesse they be sure to burne them or to hange them. Truthe it is that Christ hath sayd / that his bodye is meate / and that he which doth not receyue that meate cā haue no lyfe in him. But what that eatynge is can not Pantolab{us} tell / or at y• last he hath not yet taught it. Christ sayth that to eate his flesshe and to dryncke his blood / is to dwell in him by fayth and loue / and he agayne to dwell in vs by his sprete of
veryte / and not to heare youre popishe masse or to receyue youre sacrament. An infynite nombre of people haue thus eaten him and droncke him / which neuer knewe what your massynge or how sellynge ment / & shall lyue perpetuallye in that refeccyon. Not one euer perished that so hath receyued him / where as thousandes hath bene lost that hath be∣ne fedde at youre aulters. 2 Whereas his fleshe is eaten and sure∣lye dygested / there is seane nomore whore∣mongynge / theft / fornicacyon / ydelnesse / wytchecraft / cruelte / spyght / couetousnesse / ydolatrye / hatred / glotonye / and other fyl∣thye vyces of the fleshe. But loue / ioye / pea∣ce / pacience / longe sufferynge / gentylnesse / goodnesse / faythfulnesse / mekenesse / clen∣nesse / temperaunce / with other frutes of the sprete. It is not youre oyled generacyon ther¦fore / nor yet they that are howseled at their masses that eateth Christes fleshe & dryn∣keth his blood / which for the more part styll remayne whoremongers / buggerers / rob∣bers / cloyners / catchers / false teachers / hy∣pocrites / ydolaters / trayters / deceyuers / bellye goddes / extorcyners / murtherers of sowles / and burnets of innocentes for their true Christen beleue. Where as Christ is eaten / he dwelleth. And whereas he dwel∣leth / he will suffre no soche workes to be do∣ne. That persone can be no blasphemouse babler / no instructour of lyes / no dysdayner
of Gods worde / no peruetter of y• scripturs / as Pantolabus is here through oute all his iest. He shall not iudge that to be whyghte that is blacke / nor yet that is blacke to be whyght. But his syght shall be soche by the gyft of his sprete / that the thynge which is nought he shall so discerne it / hath it neuer so manye gloryouse glytterynge colours to the contrarye. 3 As Pantolabus is in his poesyes / so is he in his allegacyons of the scripture / a ve∣rye vnlerned ydyote / applyenge them both to his folyshe fleshlye purpose. He thynketh with Caromea vere est cibus / to proue that Christes fleshe is reallye present in their po¦pyshe sacrament. And Christ meaneth no∣thyngelesse in that whole chapter. He sayth not there my fleshe shall be naturallye pre∣sent in youre sacrament / whan ye haue ones prouyded youre oyled offycers and consecra∣te coniurers for that purpose. But my fleshe is meate / and my blood is vnfaynedlye dryn¦ke / afore there were anye soche wlyshe or∣ders. He promysed nor to dwell in that / but to dwell in vs euermore. The kyngedome of God (sayth he) cometh not with outwarde obseruacyon of lo here / and se there. For be∣holde the kyngdome of God is within yow. youre members (sayth saynt Paule) are the temple of God / and youre sowles the habi∣tacles of the holy ghost. It foloweth in that Gospell hic est panis qui de celo descendit.
He is the breade which came from heauen / & not that breade which came from the wa∣fer backers or from the breathyng of syr Lau¦rence Loyterer at the aulter. The worke of God is onlye to beleue / & not to fatche that bread at youre ydell handes. They dye that eate youre breade / and ronne headlynges to the deuyll a greate sort of them / as ded ma∣nye of the Iewes that eate Manna in the desart. But they that eate this breade shall neuer perishe. A mysterye. 1 Vvhye vvist thu then / Sett to thy penne. 2 And so playnelye Christes vvordes denye / 3 Thy peuyshe pyld reasons Vvere not vvorthe .ii. peasons 4Vvherfore in a yre Thu haddest thy hyre. 5 Iuste patiebantur secundum suas ne∣quitias. Sapien. 19. ¶The openinge. 1. RIallye styll ruffleth this rutter in his ragged rymes of rustycall rude∣nesse. He reasoneth here his matter full clarkelye with this dead manne / whye he sett his penne to boke aganyst the profy∣table wares of their markett. But so longe
as he was alyue he wolde not meddle with him. Lyke a valeaūt warryour of the Popes armye / he thynketh the victorye sone gotten of him that is gone awaye. The manne al∣redye ouerthrowne / is sone beatten. But le∣te him not thynke so to wynne anye greate worshyp at Iohan Frithes hande. For thou∣ghe his corps be dead / his sprete is alyue. Whan his fleshe was in burnyng / his fayth was most quycke / the veryte in him remay¦nynge inuincyble. The power of hell with the whole swarme of Antichrist shall neuer preayle agaynst that stronge buysdynge. Non other victorye haue ye / than had Cay∣phas ouer Christ / and the deuyll ouer Iob / tryumphe ye neuer so fast. ye maye ponnyshe the bodye and geue it to death / but ouer the sowle ye haue no power. Blessed is that mā∣ne that euer he was borne / which perseue∣reth faythfull to the ende / as Iohan Frith hath done. That he penned by his lyfe con∣cernynge the sacrament and their popyshe purgatorye / is not greatlye hyndred here as yet ōy Pantolabus dyrtye dartes. The grea∣test acte he hath done / is that he hath here paynted vs out a fole of himselfe. 2 Here is it layed vnto Iohan Frithes charge / that he shulde denye Christes wor∣des / because he wolde not in his boke admyt Aristotles realyte in their sacramēt. In de∣de he neuer denyed Christes worde / for than he shulde haue done as you do alwayes / & so
haue denyed Christ himselfe which is all one with his worde. He euermore affermed that Christes fleshe was verye meate & his blood verye dryncke / but not for the bodye. yet denyed he not the corporall eatynge. He graunted also that he was verye bread / and that he which eateth that breade shall lyue for euer. yet wolde he not haue that bread which came from the waffer backers / to be all one with that breade which came from heuen. For saynt Augustine sayth that their eatynges be diuerse. The one is eaten with the mouthe / the other with y• fayth. The one with the lyppes / the other with the harte. The one with the bodye / the other with the sowle. He wolde in no case haue them to co∣me in both at one dore. youre ordes wolde not Frith afferme / because they are not Chri¦stes but Aristotles. youre wayes are all af∣ter the Master of your sentēces / which was in an whoryshe nonne a fylthye frute of your vowed chastyte. ye folowe in youre fayth the fore steppes of Bonauenture / Thomas / Dons / Osbert / Albert / Baconthorpe / Ge∣rarde / Gyles / Gandauus / Guido / Ockham Helyoth / Holcoth / Brulifer / Dorbel / & other dyrtye diuynes forth yssuynge from him (in whom sathā hath wrought euer sens he was sett at large) refusynge the Apostles doc∣tryne. And that caused Iohan Frith neuer to agre vnto you. 3 His reasons are neuer the worse that
youre pylde popyshe brayne do not allowe them. Peuysh ynough are your poesyes / and more peuyshe a great deale youre pylde wyt∣tes. What youre reasons are / it is playne to all them / which hath eyther wytt or lernyn∣ge. The value of them is sone rekened now that they are come to y• towche stone. I thyn∣ke verelye they are neyther worth two pea∣sons / nor yet worth two nyttes or antes eg∣ges. The reasons and auctorytees of Iohan Frith concernynge Christes bodye & blood / standeth yet vntowched for all you. Moche more vndischarged. It is ynough for you to rayle and to prate / to bragge & to lye / though ye do nothynge els. ye fare lyke a gargull in a wall with a spowte in his mouthe / which doth nothynge els but spewe oute water. ye sett a greate face here vpon the matter / as though the Popes churche were holden vp by you / and nothynge do ye at all but vomete fylthye swyllynges. More lyke are you and a sort of youre fellawes more / to pull downe youre holye mother / than to kepe her vp lon∣ge / yf ye haue no better lernynge than ye shewe here. Iohan Wyclef prophecyed that your churche shuld haue an ende / had very∣te ones the victorye. Which is in short spa∣ce lyke to be founde true / yf ye plye not youre matters apace. 4 Disdaynefullye cast ye it in Iohan Fri¦thes teathe here / that he dyed in the fyre at procuremēt of your prelates. As though it
were a greate ignominye to dye for the Lor∣des veryte. But precyouse in y• syght of that lorde was the death of that faythfull yonge manne / though it were verye wretched in your syghtes regardynge nothynge but that which is pleasaunt to the fleshe. What your ende shall be / the Lorde of heauen knoweth. ye haue yet layser ynough to playe the felde bysshop / and to blesse with youre heles in an hempen corde / as a great sort of youre fella∣wes haue done which were as true menne as you are here. Therfore ye are not wyse to disdayne anye mannys ende / nor yet to iud∣ge him yll that departeth in Christes fayth. ye maye wele knowe that Christes deathe was not verye precyouse to your proude pre∣decessors the bysshoppes / pharysees / & la∣wers / whan they went vp and downe there mockynge and mowynge as you do now here with youre meters. No better is the seruaūt than his master / nor yet the disciple than he that sent him. Full vnlyke is y• syght of god to youre syght / and his insrutable iudge∣mentes to youre carnall iudgemētes. Bles∣sed is Iohan Frith that he suffreth styll at your handes these obprobryes for his holye names sake / for sure is he of the kyngedome of heauen. 5 The clause that ye haue here inspient∣lye raught out of the last chapter of Spien∣ce / to make good with it your malicyouse me∣ters agaynst Iohan Frith / will not Sapien∣ce
allowe now for his / ye haue so disuygured yt. If ye had gentyllye borowed it / & not so theuishlye stolne it / he wolde gladlye haue receyued it of you agayne. But now it is youre owne ragged stuffe & not his. He hath there / Iuste patiebātur secundum suas ne∣quitias / and not patiebatur. The Egypcya∣nes (sayth he) which cruellye persecuted the chosen people of God vndre Pharao / hath worthelye sufferd accordynge to their many folde wyckednesses. He is not contented wt you nor yet with soche other false Prophetes as will so preposterouslye bestowe his scrip∣turs / as to geue that to gods fryndes which belongeth to his enemyes. In the ende of that chapter is this text folowynge / wher∣in Iohan Frith hath now his porcyon / but that coude not Pantalab{us} perseyue. In om∣nibus enim magnificasti populum tuum Do¦mine / & honorasti. In all thynges lorde hast thu done the best for thy people / & so brought them to honoure. Thu hast not despysed thē but alwaye and in all places hast thu gra∣cyouslye stande by them. The Egypcyanes now are you / as wytnesseth saynt Iohan in the Apocalyps. 11. youre greate cyte (sayth he) hath a spirituall name / youre churche is called Sodoma and Egyptus. For there ye daylye crucifye the Lorde in his members / besydes that ye do in youre daylye Masses / or newe founde sacrifices for the quycke and the dead.
A mysterye. 1 Next of this secte That vvas suspecte. 2 Vvas one Lamberte A manne peruerte. 3 And almost vvood. 4 Probauerunt habere Deum in noti∣tia, tradidit illos Deus in reprobum sensum. Rom. 1. ¶The openinge. 1. SEryouslye hath Pantolabus sought his wyttes here / to clowte vp his Ge¦nealogie with sumwhat. But I marue¦le moche that for .v. years space betwixt the burnynges of Iohan Frith and Iohan Lam∣bert / he coude fynde out non els for his pur∣pose. His bloodye generacyon of mytred ma∣houndes and their shauen sergeaūtes / were not wonte to be so longe vnoccupyed. His ho¦lye mother (whom saynt Iohan reporteth to be droncke in the blood of martyrs) was not wonte to fast so longe from that drynke / but wolde coole her hote thirst ere that tyme / hauynge so fyerye a stomake / wele I wote that manye than suffred at London / Colche¦stre / Hadleye / Ippeswyck / Norwyche / Lyn∣ne / and in other more places of Englande. Good Wyllyā Tyndale was done to death also at Vylforde in Braban within the same years / by the procurement of youre craftye
Cayphases / in the yeare of oure Lorde a M. V. and .xxxv. in the moneth of Septembre And therfore I wondre they escaped youre hande. This maketh vs to thynke that ye entended of these onlye with those that he∣re foloweth to iest at youre pleasure / vpon soche malyce as ye had agaynst them con∣ceyued. Sure are you to be of soche a secte / as will worke lyttle goodnesse. Lete menne suspect of you what they will / but these po∣pyshe poesyes of yours smell knauyshlye / whan ye can fynde out non other heretyques but these alone / of so manye Popes / poyse∣ners / trayters / sorcerers / Sodomites / scys∣matyques / and pestylent papistes as hath bene / and are yet styll to this daye. 2 Because ye are here in hande with Lam¦bert / I will saye sumwhat for him / for I kne∣we his cōuersacyon. The truthe of it is / he was sumtyme a prest of youre generacyon / called syr Iohan Nycols / and was borne in the cyte of Norwyche. After that he had in Cambryge geuen himselfe to good letters / and became sumwhat expert both in the La¦tyne and the Greke / at the preachynges of the good menne Arthure and Bylneye / he toke repentaunce of his former lyfe. And af∣ter that the kynge by his lawfull offycers had taken of him an othe to renounce the Po¦pe as a false vsurper / he threwe from him that Antichristes yoke with his lyuerye and marke to shewe himselfe throughlye obediēt
Than leauyng papistycall customes / he en∣braced the Gospell for his lyfes direccyon / & lyued otherafter a vertuouse Christen lyfe / which you iudge here a lyfe peruert / soche is youre owne Englyshe terme. This wolde I not wryte so manyfestlye / yf I knewe it not for a certente. Where as he was before an ydell Massemonger and an hater of the scri¦pturs / he became than a fauorer and folo∣wer of them. yea / he taught them vnto other and lyued his selfe accordynge to the same. Manye Christen instruccyons wrote he to his bretherne / & brought vp their chyldren in all vertu. Dyuerse workes of Erasms / and of other good authors more / translated he into the vulgar Englyshe tonge to the Christen commodyte of other. 3 And whereas Pantolabus wryteth him here to be a manne almost woode / for that he was not in fayth and opinyon to his folyshe mynde agreable. He declareth himselfe to be of lyke iudgement with those relygyouse curates of the Iewes Synagoge / which re∣ported Iohan Baptist to be a madde manne for his abstinence / and Christ to be a dronc∣karde for his good felyship kepyng. But lete him not thynke easlye to auoyde this slaun∣derouse report before the eternall iudge / vn∣lesse he repent in tyme. What so euer thu art (sayth saynt Paule) that iudgest an other / this shalt thu be sure of forthyne owne part / to condemne thyselfe / perfourmynge the sa∣me
selfe thynges that thu condemnest him of. Moche more than / yf it be left in wrytyn∣ge / as this outragyouse slaundre is / that he was a manne peruert and almost wood. Though I and soche other which haue red∣de ouer Pantolabus iest here / ded not iudge him a fellawe of a peruerse opinyon and doc∣tryne / and a Bedlem beast more than mad∣de / the seyd iest it selfe wolde do it for vs. Therfore lete him not saye that we iudge him agayne here / for his owne fylthye fru∣tes declareth him. How abhomynably the scripturs are here peruerted for a trayterou∣se popyshe purpose / to vpholde the fylthye kyngedome of Antichrist / it will be euydent to him that shall serche the places. 4 Now cometh here one in / borowed of y• first chapter of saynt Paule to the Romanes Marke the good workemanlye handelynge (I praye ye) therof. Sicut non probauerunt (sayth he) hab ere Deum in notitia / tradidit llos Deus in reprobrum sensum. As they haue not regarded to knowe their lord god / so hath he geuen them ouer into a lewde mynde. And what is this text to the purpo∣se to proue that Iohan Lambert was a man∣ne peruert and almost wood? This is there a conclusyon of an olde stynkynge matter of yours goynge but a lyttle afore / and therfore lete it not be left so cowardlye behynde you. Relicto naturali vsu femine / exarserunt in desyderiis suis in inuicem / masculi in ma∣sculos
turpitudinem operātes. They which haue vnrightouslye with holden the truthe of the lorde in vnrightousnesse / leauinge y• naturall vse of women / haue burned in lu∣stes amonge themselues / workinge menne with menne vnspekable fylthynesse. Be a∣shamed wretches / be ashamed / and bestowe ones the scripturs whereas they shuld be bestowed. Lerne to amende yowr abhomina∣ble lyuinge / and leaue to blaspheme the poo¦re innocētes by them. For yf ye can no right¦lyar bestowe them / trulye yf yowr wrytinges come to owr handes / we shall teache yow the right waye / bycause yowr own shepeher∣des are slacke. A mysterye. 1 Vvhich vvolde make good. Vvith tonge and penne. Before all menne. 2 That in the Masse. Nothinge els vvas. 3 But a signifycacion. Of Christes passion. 4 Ne sis sapiens a pud te ipsum. Prou. 1. ¶The openinge. 1. THough this verse agreeth with his other fellawe in sownde / yet doth he not agre with him in matter / & ther∣for I haue disseuered them. It is not all one
to be wood or madde and to do good / & ther∣for I haue put the good doer from the mad∣de. Pantolab{us} saith here that Lambert wol∣de make. Than is he moche better by his owne report than is his holye generacyon / for they haue euer marred▪ yea / farthermor he saith that he wolde make good. He cānot so report of his owne monstruouse mustre / for they haue made all thinges euyll. No one thinge is there vndre the heauens / that they haue not defyled with one kynde of I∣dolatrye or other. Besydes their hypocresye whoredome / Idelnesse / buggerye / and the deuill and all of soche vyces / their shameful abhorringe of marryage / their supersticou∣se forbyddynge of meates / and their abhomi∣nable peruerting of the scripturs with their sophistrye / sorcerye / wyles / wytchecraftes / decrees / decretals / actes / clementynes / ex∣trauagantes / pryuileges / bulles / & prouinci¦all synodals / makynge playne merchandyce both of the bodyes and sowles of menne. This have they done before all menne both with tunge and penne / lyke as Pantolabus here reporteth of Lambert. 2 I wyst wele this goodnesse had a tay∣le which at the latter ende wolde not seme verye good. Lambert both with tunge and penne was a contynuall aduersarye to their holye Masse / which is their princypall mar¦ket / and that is the cause that he is here re∣gestred for an heretyq̄ yea / marrye set / now
vnderstande the matter moche better than I coude afore. Now can I tell yow what he∣resye is as ye take it / and who be the herety¦ques that yow meane. Not they that speake ageynst the father of heauen with Sabelli∣us and Arrius. Nor they that blaspheme y• sonne with Porphirius and Photinus / Nor yet they which impugne the holye ghost wt Macedonius and Eunomius. But they on∣lye which replye ageynst yowr Masse / made by so manye holye Popes. They poore sow∣les are alone in this yowr Genealogye / and non other heretyques els. By this we perscy∣ue that ye are those yll stewardes whō saint Paule speaketh of / that seke yowr owne and not Iesus Christes / makynge of yowr bel∣lyes your God. yowr vayne glorye (sayth he) wyll be yowr confusion / for nothinge ye sa∣uer but that which is earthlye. What is yowr Masse els but a gawdishe fopperye or a toye of yowr owne ymaginacyon? Nomore is it lyke the holye supper of Christ / than y• earthe is lyke heauē or fylthye dyrt lyke gol¦de. No / make of it the best ye cāne with your lyghtes / vestymentes / copes / Iewels / aul∣tres / Images / organes / prycksonge / sensyn∣ges / & the deuyll and all / as y• paganes ded in their olde sacrifices before their Idols. 3 If Lambert graunted yow that in yowr Masse so patched and peced with papystrye was a synifycacion of Christes deathe / ye were moche to blame so to burne him. For
he graunted yow more than anye māne will do els / that is godlye wyse and lerned. But surelye he neuer graūted that to yowr Mas∣se / but to the most holye supper of the lorde / and therfor ye haue mysvnderstande his sa¦ynges. In yowr Masse is nothinge but that ye make yowrselues by the vertu of Arysto∣tles realyte. No / though ye .vii. tymes brea∣the ouer it / Hoc est corpus meum. For christ is neuer made but in vs / and that is by the vertu of his worde trulye taught. And that is the cause that Saynt Paule ded saye. So oft as ye shall eate this breade and dryn¦ke of this cuppe / ye shall shewe the lordes deathe tyll he come. Whan Christ badde ye do it in his remembraunce he badde ye not make him ageyne. The trayuelynge womā which is with childe in the Apocalyps / beto¦keneth Christes people / hauinge him with∣in them and not without them. More ouer Dauid sayth that the bewtyfull dowter of y• kynge is all from within. yowr Masse mon∣gers turne their tayles to the people & prea¦che to the wall as Antichrist hath thaught them / but neuer turne they to them decla∣ringe the true meaninge therof / as Christ hath commaūded. And therfor their fylthye sacrifyces are Antichristes and not Christs and that they make there is an Idoll and no God / and therfor vnmete to be worship∣ped. They shal aryse in the morninge (saith the lorde) and not fynde me / they shall call vnto me whan I shall not heare them / and
whan they holde vp their polluted handes / I shall turne awaye my face. 4 Nothynge to the purpose is this alle∣gacyon of Salomons Prouerbes. esis sa∣piens apud temetipsum. To proue that the Masse is sumwhat more than a signifyca∣cyon of Christes passyon. And agayne y• text is falselye placed / for it is not in y• first chap∣ter / but in the .iii. This craftye cōueyaunce of yours / is to playe boo pepe with the sym∣ple people. ye ruffle out youre scripturs / but whan menne shall seke them / they shall be sure not to fynde them where you appoynt them / least they shulde with them fynde out also youre iuglynges. This is now the .iii. tyme ye haue played this towche / lete youre conueyaūce be sumwhat cleaner. If ye laye that text vnto Lambertes charge / that he was to wyse in his owne conceyt / ye do him moche wronge / for that cōcept is yours and not his. you haue for that folyshe conceyt of yours / putta syde all the wysdome of God. Vtterlye despyse you Christes institucyon / accountynge him / but an ydyote fole that coude not make soche solempne preparaciōs as ye haue made. Full lyttle consydered you in the same selfe chapter. Quod abominatio Domino est omnis illusor / & cum simplici∣bus sermocinatio eius. Abhominable to the Lorde is eeye disdaynefull scorner / where as the simple disdayned shall knowe his se∣crete counsels. The mocker will he lawgh

A mysterye. 1 And vtterlye He ded denye. 2 That Christ vnfayned Vvas there contayned. 3 Both ryastye And substancyallye. 4 Quotiescunc{que} manducabitis panem hunc▪ & calicem bibetis &c. 1. Cor. 10. The openinge. 1. UErelye these poesyes are straunge & diuerse. They make me to remem∣bre the processyon of Maydston in kent. For some of them daunse lyke greate gyauntes and are eyght syllabes a pece. As this verse here afore. But a significacyon. Some come doppynge after lyke lyttle hop∣pe on my thombes / and are but .iiii. syllabes as. And vtterlye / with his fellawe as short as he. And therfore it is but madde gere. But what is it (I praye you) that Lambert ded denye? That Christ was his Lorde. No verelye ded he not / but stode stedefastlye by it vnto the verye death / that he was his on∣lye sauer / peacemaker / helthe / ryghtuous∣nesse / and redemer. He alone was the lambe that dyed for him. And he alone was y• head
of that churche that he was a membre of. In this fayth perseuered he vnto his latter ende / and in the same departed vnto his lor∣de God. yet sought your generacion by most turkyshe tyrannye to compell him to remoue his fote from that rocke. But mercyfull was that lorde vnto him. In the myddes of the fyre denyed not he his veryte / but departed hence with the clere victorye ouer you. Non of the Popes sworne subiectes dyed he / but the verye true seruaunt of Iesus Christ. 2 His denyall was in dede that Christ shuld be contayned in the bankett of youre blessynge. Remembre first from whens your blessynges come / and out of whose auctorite they sprange first of all. Saynt Iohan sayth in the Apocalyps that the Dragon (ye wote whom he meaneth) gaue his auctoryte / sea∣te / and power vnto the great Beast that aro∣se out of the see. And in an other chapter fo∣lowyng he sayth also / that y• worldlye gouer∣nours / as emprours / kynges / and princes / shuld applye their strengthes (which con∣sisteth in their lawes / swerdes / & scepturs) vnto the same fylthye freke. Of this Beast haue you that marke wherwith ye bye & sell. youre yles and shauynges are not of Christ nomore are youre myters and typpettes. If he wolde haue sent forth soche minysters / he neded to haue gone no farther than to An¦nas and Cayphas / Ioāns and Alexander / with other of y• same affynite / for they were
of a kyndred prouyded of God to soche offy∣ces of externe obseruacions / but yet not to make newe goddes nor yet to sence ymages. youre vncommaunded exorcysmes and bles∣synges are non other than the playne practy¦ses of Necromancye. By the vertu wherof / though ye maye with youre Pope fatche the deuyll from hell (for youre sacrifices are all one) yet can ye not drawe the sonne of God out of heauen and so make oure crede of non effecte. 3 yet can ye not out of youre ragged rea∣lyte / borowed of the Paganes lernynge / for ant of scripturs to youre mynde. Ther will ye haue him to be reallye / onlye whan ye shall commaunde him. That is to saye / that the thynge there in syght made of flower and water / is verye he in dede by the vertu of youre office. ye will haue him there also substanciallye in his owne propre persone / in lengthe and in breadethe / in form and proporcion / with fleshe / blood / skynne / bo∣nes / heare / tethe / and nayles. ye are verye connynge worke menne that ye can do so mo∣che in so lyttle tyme and with so fewe wor∣des. But ye can not tell vs whether he syt∣teth or standeth / lawgheth or wepeth. I thin¦ke verelye he myght wepe in dede yf that naturall affect were now styll regnynge in his glorifyed bodye / lyke as he sumtyme we∣pte vpon Hierusalem / to se his dere heryta∣e so wretchedlye abused of you. I can not /
but moche maruele that ye requyre so great honour to those wares of yowr makinge / & so little worshipp to the eternall testament of Iesus Christ. Whye holde ye not vp that euerlastinge treasure before the people? Whye tell ye thē not that he is therin both reallye and susanciallye contained? No / ye will non therof. For it is neyther to yowr spirituall commodite nor yet auaūage. ye will cruellye persecute it and blaspheme it makinge the people to beleue that it is most detestable heresye. 4. yowr text here of / Quociesunque mā¦ducabitis panem hune / et calicem bibetis & c. is nothinge at all vpon yowr syde / but di∣rectlye ageynst yow. So oft as ye shall eate this breade (sayth Saint Paule) and drinke of this cuppe &c. Here is the communion of Christes holye supper not called Christ him selfe / but breade & drynke receyued of christ. Moche lesse than is yowr waffer cake christ which yow haue receyued of the Pope. A cur¦tal haue ye made of that text / cutting awa¦ye this tayle cleane from his rompe / Mortē dominianunciabitis donec veniat / least o∣ther menne shuld knowe the truthe of the thinge & what were the true office in that ministracion. Herin are ye tolde that whan ye so ate / ye shuld shewe the lordes deathe tyll he come / but that will ye neuer do. If ye marke wele the same (Tyll he come) yowr re¦alite and substancialite of Christes presen∣.
there bodylye / will sone apere nothinge at all. Both here & afore ye haue writē it ry∣allye with a y in both yowr prented coppy∣es. If it be yowr fawte / ye are but a fole in yowr owne occupacion. If the fawte be of yowr .ii. prenters / than are both yow lewde for teachinge of them soche wytcherye as they can not vnderstande / and they beastlye also to beleue soche blinde beggerye / myni∣strynge it so a brode for moneye. ye offe vs here ageyne in both yowr coppyes one chap¦ter for an other / and I am verye glad of it. For in so doinge / ye bringe vs to the truthe of yowr matter. In that .x. chapter is it wri¦ten. Nolo autem vos socios / fieri demonior I wyll yow in no case (saith Saint Paule) to haue felyshyp with deuils. ye cā not at ones be partakers of the lordes table / and of the table of deuils. That is offred to yowr I∣dols is no mete refecciō for the christianes. As yowr daylye sacrifices are / which ye ma∣ke before the Images of yowr aulters / and not before the people of God. It shuld se∣me a farre other catinge and drinkinge that Saint Paule doth meane / than this yowr morninge brekefast is / by that which goth afore there. For he sayth that all y• fathers afore Christes comminge. As Adam / Noe / Abraham / Moyses / Dauid / and soche other ded eate of one spirituall meate / though that Christ came longe after / yet had they neuer yowr whyght God wt so many blessin∣ges.
A mysterye. But lyke a fole He vvas set at scole. By a dyuyne For to declyne. 3 This prono vvne hoc. 4 Hoc est corpus meum. Matth. 26. ¶The openinge. 1. WOrshyplye doth this Poete bestowe his wyttes here / yf ye marke him we∣le / flatterynglye fawnynge vpon so∣me great pyller of his churche for a vaun∣age / though it be not vpon his good lorde of Wynchestre. A common custome is it of these vayne hypocrites and ydell wytted pa∣pistes / to cloyne with all craftye colours and ingyns possyble for to crepe into the fauer of those that the worlde lawheth vpon. Wo be vnto you false prophetes (sayth Ezechiel) that some pyllowes vndre mennys arme ho∣les and bolsters vndre their heades / to cat∣che sowles with all for lucre. Moche better (sayth Salomon) are the strypes of a louer / than the frawdelent kysses of a flatterer. More profyght is it to be chastened of a wy∣se manne / than to be deceyued by the law∣hynge of foles. Soche a false flatterer wol∣de not Dauid regarde / but cōmaunded him strayght wayes to be slayne. By these flat∣terynge meters it is easye to perseyue what
Pantolabus seketh here. A benefyce of my lorde to synge for butterflyes / that the pro∣fyghtes therof myght pamper him vp in all ydelnesse. And for that he hath magnyfyed his good lordeshyppe here with a lye / in re∣portynge him to proue Lambert a fole in the disputacion of their sacrament / and to sett him agayne to scole to declyne this pronow∣ne hoc. But I feare me they will proue foles both / his good lorde and he / ere the matter be fullye ended. 2 The diuynite of this great diuyne of his / will scarselye apere good sophistrye or yet simple gramer after olde Alexanders rewles / be it ones tryed by the scripturs. I thynke it be no better than course legerde∣mayne / for all these gloriouse glauerynges. Diuinare is sumtyme to gesse at a venture / and thervpon (I suppose) he calleth him he∣re a diuyne / and not for anye truthe he hath vttered therin / or in anye other godlye mat∣ter els as yet. Not onlye is this great pyller of holye churche thus regestred here of Pan¦tolabus in this his genealogie of heresye / that he shulde be good lorde vnto him in an other matter / as yf a benefyce fell that he myght be preferred for this his good zele / but also his good diuynite is putt in here with him. The nature of this dowtye diuy∣nite is to stande moche in the declynynge of pronownes / as he hath here full poeticallye described it. This was in the olde tyme but
boyes playe in the gramer scoles / and now it is taken vp for hygh diuynite in the consi∣storye scoles of the papistes / to proue Christ reallye and substanciallye present in their sacrament. Lyke is it to be no small matter for menne to be burned for / are they haue do∣ne with it / that hath so substancyall proues or argumentes. Necessarye is it to declyne a pronowne wele / for him that will knowe the mysterye therof after their meanynge. Now forsoth here is godlye Christen lernynge crept latelye into Englande for the mayn∣tenaunce of their newe Christen beleue. 3 Sumwhat must these braggynge hypo∣crites haue alwayes to blynde with the eyes of the simple / which neuer seketh oute their wyles. So folyshe are they that they nothyn¦ge els beleue / but that they haue in falsehe∣de taught them / as the blynde with the blyn¦de so fallynge into the dytche. Here is it boa∣sted of Pātolab{us} that his good lorde of Wyn¦chestre that greate diuyne proued lambert an heretyque with this pronowne hoc. The sentence that Christ spoke at his last supper amonge his disciples and bretherne / had neyther hic nor hoc / for it was in the Hebrue speche which hath neyther of both. Wherefo∣re the declynynge of hoc maketh nothynge at all for the tryall of anye veryte therin. More to the purpose had the comparynge or conferrynge of that Latine pronowne with panis or with corpus bene / than the decly∣nnge
therof. That is yet all togither to fo∣lyshe. I put Wynchestre and Pantolabus the case / that the Hebrue hath not the new∣tre gendre / as it hath not in dede. How will they thā with their newe diuinite declyne their pronowne hoc? I thinke both their wit¦tes wyll scarselye wele serue them / hauin∣ge no better helpe thā themselues. Erasm{us} saith also in his annotacions / that this ver¦be substantyue est / is not in the Greke nomo¦re than it is in the Hebrue. I maruele how they wolde handle this matter also yf they shuld grāmaticallye declyne it. It is a worl¦de (they saye) to heare foles prate whan they be vpon their alebenche. 4 Now cometh forth the text / that must make vp all their market / yf it be not all togi¦ther ageynst thē / which is to be feared. We fynde not in y• Gospell neyther of Matthew Marke / nor Luke / nor yet in Paule to the Co∣rinthes / that Christ breathed vpon y• bread whan he seyd / Hoc est corpus meum. For all they make mensyon that it was out of his handes and delyuered to his Apostles befor he spake those wordes. Therfor that brea∣thinge of yowrs vpon the breade / is but a newe sounde toye of yowr owne sorcerye / to make men beleue that ye are great doers by the vertu of yowr oylinges and shauinges. He gaue thankes in dede vnto God his fa∣ther but the wordes of his thankesgeuinge (which were the wordes of his consecraciō)
he lest not here be hinde him / soryow to df yowr feates with. For he knewe yow subty∣e worke menne. ye haue alwayes a craftye custome (for your occupaciō is nothinge els but crafte) to gelde yowr scriptures of so mo∣che as ye thinke shuld discouer yow. Quod pro vobis tradetur / had as good place and was as wele allowed in Christes consecra∣cion (as yow falselye take it) as had Hoc est corpus meū. And I thinke verely that y• one declareth the other after his meanyng / but not after your subtile meaning for your aduā¦tage. He called that his body that shuld be betrayed for thē / now construe you y• rest be∣cause yeare so cōning in construcciōs. By as clarkely diuinite as you do vse here / a māne might axe yow whether ye call that hoc of yowrs / this or that? As this is my bodye wt sitteth / or that is my bodye which ye haue eaten. For he badde them both take and ea∣te / and paused sumwhat after / before he sayd This is my bodye which shall be betrayed for yow. ¶Amysterye. 1 But lyke a blocke. He had nought to saye. Nother ye nor naye. 2 Vvher for lyke a davve. He vvas iudged by the lavve. 3 To be dravvne verelye. And burned for heresye.
4 Confuse sunt sapientes. Hiere. 3. ¶The openinge. 1. XErxes the cruell kyng of the Parthy∣anes in his frantyck furye made prou¦de preparacions of .x. hndreth thou∣sande soudiours ageynst the Grekes / yet was he at y• latter slayne but of one simple captayne called Artabanus. Verye lyke is it to be so here with Pantolabus yf he taketh not hede. Though he hath vpō his syde the Popes great armye or infynite host of cardi∣nals / Bisshoppes / suffraganes / archedea∣cons / chauncellers / officials / cōmissaryes / deanes / prebendes / colligeners / doctors / ba¦chyllers / persones / curates / prestes / lawers purgatorye prowlers / and holye water mon∣gers / with hattes / whodes / myters / scarlet∣tes / furres / cattes tayles / cōmissiōs / scrow∣les / cytacions / pardons / surpleses / crysma∣toryes / stoles / and oyle boxes with the de∣uill and all / yet shall poore Christ with one blast or puffe of his mouthe ouerthrow him. Here scornefullye disdayneth he Iohan lam¦bert a poore membre of his / full blockyshlye callinge him a blocke hauinge nought to sa∣ye (he saith) whan his reuerende lorde dispu¦ted with him / neyther yea nor naye. And I beleue it wele. For Lambert afore had ler∣ned this wyse lesson of Salomon. Ne respō∣deas stulto iuxta stulticiamsuam &c. An∣swere not a fole accordinge to his folyshnes¦nesse / least thu apere lyke to him. He consi∣dered
also that his master Iesus Christ had verye fewe wordes before Annas and Cay∣phas / and non at all before Herode / least he shuld haue geuen that was holye to dogges and that was preciouse vnto swyne. 2 What skylleth it how dawyshe and fo¦yshe you iudge him which haue no iudge∣ment that is godlye / whyls Christ hath pro¦mised him a plentuouse reward in heauē for that he suffreth here of yow. Saint Paule saith that the worde of the crosse is euermo∣re iudged folyshnesse to them that shall pe∣rishe. But vnto them that shall be saued it is y• power of God. In that he was iudged by the law at your procuremēt / he hath that rewarde which his master promised him / & that he his selfe had afore. If they haue per¦secuted me (saith he) they shall also persecu∣e yow. For no better is the scruaunt thā his master. If yowr madde modye generaciō cal¦led Christ afore tyme / samaritane / dronkar∣de / deuill / heretyque / & traytour / what mar∣uele is it though yow folowinge after in the same selfe fore steppes call so his poore mē∣bre? No lesse rewarde hath Iohan Lambert (as I beleue) for sufferinge yowr violence at London / than had Antipas the faithfull wytnesse of y• lorde which was cruellye slay¦ne at Pergamos. For that stronge victorye which he had ouer yow / not beinge ouerco∣men in his faithe by the terrour of deathe wt yow procured him / he hath now of his lorde
God that swete Manna which is hydde frō the wyse of this worlde / & that fayre whight Stone which hath the newe name writen that no manne knoweth saue he that recey∣ueth it. 3 A great sort of your shorne generacion o ere drawne to the gallowes in the seconde yeare of kynge henrye the forth / and now in owr tyme also for betrayenge this realme to the Pope as I haue tolde you afore / but at them ye triumphe nothinge at all. Fryre Iohan forest a wyse prelate of yowrs was both hanged and brent for heresye and trea¦son / yet is he non of your Genealogye. The marques of Eetur / the lorde Moūtegue / sir Edwarde neuele / sir Adryan foscue / & a great nombre of trayters more / suffred dea∣the openlye / yet are they not here remēbred. But easye it is the cause to coniecture / for they were your fryndes. They dyed for the lybertees of your whorishe churche / as ded your holy trayter Thomas Becket / to main¦teyne ye in all pryde and voluptuousnesse. ye knowe what ye do wele ynough / though / ye be not all with the godlye wysest. yowr quarell in this iest is onlye ageynst herety∣ques / speciallye ageynst soche as hath demi¦nisshed your lyuīges. As this Lambert was one / whom here ye repart to be burned for he¦resye / not yll apayed therof. To them that are brent for Christes veritees sake / remay¦neth the same crowne of rightousnesse / that
remayned vnto Polycarpus the Bisshop of Smyrna / which was also brent for the same for whan the ryghtfull iudge shall come at the latter daye / that now semeth ryght in youre eyes will than apere otherwyse. No∣thynge shall there be decysed after youre po∣pishe lawes / but all accordynge to that wor∣de whom ye now condemne for heresye. 4 For a custome in a maner ye take it / fal∣selye to allege youre scripturs. And to amen∣de the matter ye haue made it false Latine / wherby I iudge you but a sengle syr Iohan. ye occupye here the feminyne gendre for the masculyne. I suppose it is for some good loue ye beare to that gendre out of the ryght rew∣le. If these fawtes had bene but in one of youre coppyes / we myght haue thought it the printers neglygence. But now we are cō¦pelled to iudge it youre ignoraunce. Confu∣si sunt sapientes / is not in the .iii. chapter of Hieremie / but in the .viii. And it is there spo¦ken of those prestes and preachers / which ministreth vnto the people lyenge lernynge for lucre. For it foloweth immediatly after / Verbum enim Domini proiecerunt / & sapiē∣tia nulla est in eis. The worde of the Lorde haue they throwne at their tayles / and haue now no maner of wysdome. Their rebuke (sayth the prophete) is open / for they do abho¦minable thynges / yet are they not ashamed. No / they will knowe of no maner of shame. If this be not spoken of youre fylthye gene∣racion /
I report me to you. ye wolde fayne haue it serue for Frith & Lambert. As who shuld saye: They were confounded of youre bisshoppes for all their wysdome. No / no / youre bisshoppes are confounded by them / though the worldlye eyes seyth it not. And they are departed hence with victorye in the veryte. A mysterye. 1 Next after him Came in a lymme. 2 Of Antichrist An Anabaptyst. 3 One Peter Franke. 4 Hi sunt fontes sine aqua, quibus cali∣go tenebrarum reseruatur. 2. Pet. 2. ¶The openinge. 1. YMagyne yow neuer so manye craftye colours / yet can ye not hyde a wolfe. Now couple ye these good menne with the Anabaptistes / y• more to blemishe their names / though they neuer agreed to that su∣persticyouse secte. Rather shuld the Anabap¦tistes seme to be of youre sorte than of theirs For they haue in a maner the same opinion of fre will / & of iustificacion by workes that you haue. They will obeye no temporall ma∣gistrates / and nomore will you but by com∣pulsyon. They force not to breake their othe
of allegeaunce / & nomore do you. They wol∣de haue all mennes goodes in common / & so wolde you also / youre owne alwayes excep∣ted. And this foredele of them ye haue in that article. ye are sure in euery mānes goo∣des to haue a porcion by tyttle of tythes / of∣ferynges / confessions / testaments / masses / & so forth / doynge lyttle or nothynge for it / and so are not they. And therfore I can not se / but ye are a membre of theirs / as daunge¦rouse / coyeshe / and diuerse as ye make it. Marrye in dede a zele they haue vnto the Gospell / thoughe nothynge to knowlege / which yow neuer had yet / but a most bytter hate in the stede therof. And therfore ye se∣me rather to be lymmes of the denyll (which hath bene a murtherer in youre spyghtfull generacion euer sens the beginnynge) than of anye congregacion that is godlye. 2 If ye knewe so wele what an Antichrist were as ye can name him / ye shuld here pluc¦ke youre selfe by the nose harde. But I per∣seyue wele now ye are but a wytlesse fole. It is not y• ebaptisynge or retynctynge agayne in water that maketh an Antichrist / but the obstinate resistaunce of that heauenlye ve∣ryte which Christ ones taught. He is a ve∣rye Antichrist which vndre Christes tyttle playeth a part cleane contrarye to Christ. As where as Christ was meke / gentyll / sow∣lye / mercyfull / peceable / poore / pytefull / iust and true. He is cruell / ferce / frowarde / fran∣tyck /
tyrannouse / proude / vaynegloriouse / spyghtfull / wycked / and false / and yet is all done in Christes stede what blasphemye so euer he worketh. Antichrist after y• scripturs is he which calleth himselfe holye / chan∣geth y• lawes / obserueth dayes and tymes / doth manye false miracles / denyeth Christ / destroyeth peoples / woundeth vnto death / assoyleth for monye / iudgeth euyll good and good euyll / is worshypped of Princes / burneth in concupiscence / and shall be de∣stroyed with the onlye breath of Gods mou∣the. Now blowe in both youre fystes / & tell me whom they meane. ye knowe I am sure they are which worketh all these fea∣tes / els are ye a manne of verye small expe∣rience. But here perauenture ye playe Tom Nytygo. ye knowe it / but ye will not be ac∣knowne of it. 3 To assertayne yowe fullye of the mat∣ter / the great Antichrist is youre whole cler∣gye with the layte of the same false faythe. Of the which youre holye father the Pope with his college of cardinals is the head / All Patriarkes / Archebishoppes / metropo∣lytanes / bisshoppes / lawers / doctors / pre∣stes / presones / curates / monkes / chanons / and nonnes are the bodye / & the .iiii. orders of fryers which came last of all are the tayle that couereth his arse / which is now cutt of in Englande / and therfore he is there beco∣me a curtall. This is the great bodye of sa∣than
which ministreth to the worlde all fyl∣thynesse of ydolatrie and necrolatrie. What Peter Franke was by his lyfe (whom ye call here a lymme of Antichrist) I can not iustlye report / for he was of an other nacyon. But yf that mannes lyfe maye be called good / who∣se ende is godlye and perfyght / I dare bol∣delye saye that his lyfe was good. For in his death confessed he the Lorde Iesus Christ to be his onlye sauer and redemer / which is the true seale marke of the seruaunt of God. In the myddes of the fyre also he stode with¦oute feare / sorowe / tremblynge / changynge of countenaūce / or dissolute mouyng: which were playne tokens of a conscience not tro∣bled / but assertayned throughlye of a moche better lyfe after this lyfe. This lerned I in Colchestre of them which were by his onlye deathe or pacient sufferaūce / cōuerted from youre papisme vnto true repentaunce / whe∣re as nothynge afore coude conuert them. 4 A verye theues part haue ye played he∣re with the text / which ye haue taken out of saint Peters seconde epistle. Hi sunt fontes sine aqua / quibus caligo tenebrarū reserua∣tur. For ye haue left oute of it no lesse than these .iiii. wordes / & nebule turbinibus exa∣gitate. These (saith saint Peter) are y• wel∣les without water / & clowdes carryed forth with tempestes / to whom is reserued the my∣ste of darkenesse. This was neuer spoken for anye that euer yet dyed for the veryte.
But for soche subtyle soth sayers as deceyue the people / lyuinge here in all voluptuous∣nesse. For thus beginneth the chapter. Fue¦runt pseudo Prophete in populo / scut & in vob is erunt magistri mendaces. Amongest the people were false prophetes / lyke as the¦re shall be amonge yow lyenge masters al∣so. These shall preuilye bringe in dampna∣ble sectes / denienge the verye lorde that bought them. Manye will folowe their vo∣luptuouse wayes / by whom y• verite shall be blasphemed. For couetousnesse shall they with fayned wordes make merchaundyse of you (saith he) but their iudgement is not farre of / neyther slepeth their vtter damp∣nacion. All this with moche more yet folo∣winge of Balaam the false prophete / and of Sodom and Gomor / is spokē of your fylthye spiritualte / yf it be indifferentlye marked. And therfor kepe it vnto yow as yowr owne propre good / and turne it not vnto those pos¦te menne which haue no porcion therin. A mysterye. 1 Vvhich sayd full ranke. That Christ and God. Toke not manhode. 2 Of Marye the virgine. Vvhich vvas vvithout synne 3 Verbum caro factum est. Ioan. 1. ¶The openinge.
ZElouse wolde this Poete fayne be sea¦ne in his holye mothers quarell by y• vyllenouse contempt of other. But marke the ende of it. Whyls he rankelye ac¦cuseth other menne of heresyes / he playeth the ranke heretyque his selfe. He deuydeth me here Christ and God by intermingling a coniuncciō copulatiue / as though they we¦re .ii. and not one. Though Athanastus ma∣de a difference of the godhede from the mā∣hede / yet knyt he them togither in Christ. But this rāke heretique Papist disseuereth Christ from the godhede / so makinge owr la¦dye the mother of .ii. chyldren. He willeth al¦so by this proposicion / that Christ beinge manne a fore / shuld take his manhode with God ageyne in Marye. Thus concludeth he .iii. abhominable heresies in one. In this had he nede to go to scole ageyne with his great diuine / & sumwhat better to be taught to declyne this matter. Ranker heresyes thā these / were neuer taught of Marcion / Ma∣nes / Arrius / nor Eutices / the greatrest here¦tyques of all. Therfor Pantolab{us} maye we∣le stande in the fore warde of heretyques / & be first here of his owne Genealogye. But he is sure to haue no harme of the Bysshop∣pes / for their smellinge serueth thē not that waye. But se how true the promises of the lorde are. He that layeth a snare shall fall into it. Who stryketh with the swerde / shall peryshe with the same. And he that iudgeth
his poore brother / condempneth himselfe. Well / blessed / be the name of that lorde. 2 The doctrine of these papystes haue a great shyne of godlynesse / yet is it but fyl∣thye hypocresye. The blessed virgine Ma∣rye which was the elect mother of Christ / detesteth soche fryuolouse and blasphemou∣se bablinges as they geue vnto her. As that she was without sinne in her concepcion / with soche other folysh fantasyes. Was not her father a synner? was not her mother an offender? Was she not brought forth in A∣dam? Declined not she with all other? Had she no nede of Christes sufferinges with o∣ther? Though the papistes supersticiouslye denye all this / yet doth she swete virgine af¦ferme it. My sowle (saith she) magnifyeth y• lorde / and my spretereioyseth in God my sa¦uer. What neded he to haue bene her sauer / yf nothinge had bene in the waye to condēp¦nacion ageinst her? Oh / blasphemouse here tyques and excertable papystes / which thus denye her the benefight of owr redempcion. Christ came to saue synners onlye / and not the arrogaunt rightouse / which had no ne∣de of hi. Lyke as ye are false iustiiaryes / so do ye bestowe your stodyes. She neuer coue∣red as yow do with the proude Pharise / not to be as other menne are. But she was wele contented to be of the common sort / to be ex∣alted vp from mekenesse. And as touchinge Peter Franke that he shuld denye Christ to
take manhode of her / ye lye falselye of him. He dyed in no soche wycked opinion as ma∣nye haue crediblye reported. But sumthyn∣ge ye must nedes laye for your selues / whan ye haue done soche murther and mischefe. 3 Full lyke a wyse clarke brynge ye forth that text: Verbum caro factum est / the wor∣de became fleshe / and lyke a fleshlye gentyl∣manne. I maruele where this clause was a∣fore / that ye ioyned not God with Christe therwith / but made them two by the vertue of youre coniunccion copulatyue. ye do ma∣nye madde miracles / whan ye come to youre owne wyttes without the scripturs. In ipso vita erat / sayth the Gospell afore. In that worde was the lyfe and the lyght of menne. But of that worde will you fatche no lyght / nor yet suffre other menne to fatche lyght there / so farre as ye maye withstande yt. They must fatche lyght at you / & yet ye are those folyshe virgynes that Christ speaketh of / whose lampes are oute / for ye are chast geldynges all. ye are that folyshe fygge tree which hath nothynge els but leaues. Whan ye are in youre most pryde / ye shall wyther a∣waye lyke a thynge of nought. It is not this text that confuteth the vngodlye opinion of the Anabaptistes. For all they beleue that he became fleshe. But to proue that he toke that fleshe of the virgyne / we must go vnto the stronge promyses of God made vnto the Serpent / to Abraham / and to Dauid. That
Sede of the woman (sayth the Lorde) shall treade the on the head. In thy Sede (sayth he to Abraham) shall all the kyndredes of y• earthe be blessed. Blessed is the frute of thy wombe / sayth the holye ghost in Elizabeth to Marie: and so forth. That illius and that Tui in the textes must be groundelye re∣membred / & than shall they not be able ones to hysse at it. A mysterye. 1 Next after this Came in yvvys. 2 Barnes the blynde That neuer coude fynde. 3 By nyght nor daye The ryght path vvaye 4 To Christes lore. 5 Qui peruersi cordis est, non inuenit bonum. Prouer. 17. ¶The openynge. 1. BRagyngly styll brawleth this babler and can fynde non ende of his inso∣lent madnesse. The mouthe of a wyt∣lesse nodye (saith Salomon) poureth out all folyshnesse. The hart of a fole (saith Eccle∣siaticus) is lyke a pott that is broken / for it neuer retayneth wysdome. Here is now mo∣che matter agaynst Robert Barnes / and all is not worth a nutt. Now cometh Pantola∣bus
in with his rhetoryckes of this & yrcey It is verye harde aborde with vs whan we are dryuen to soche narrowe shyftes / that we must nedes haue to make vp our meters / verelye / ywys / & certayne wt soch lyke. They that are exercysed in makyng / wil iudge tho¦se meters lowsye. But it is lernynge good ynough for the gracelesse Papistes / lyke as draffe is most fyt for swyne. The more folys∣he y• better for thē / & the more dawyshe it be y• fytter it is for their grosse wyttes. No / they will be non of these newe heretyques they. The wysdome of this worlde hath taught them an other lesson than so. They will sle∣pe in an whole skynne though they shuld to the deuyll for their errours. Next after this shall come in sumwhat / but I thyncke no great wysdome into Pantolab{us} brayne / vn∣lesse he change from this frantycke frenesye into some purpose godlye / and repent soche willfull wodenesse. But I doubt verye mo∣che in that. 2 I thynke in conscience that a blynder beast than Pantolabus / is not this daye a∣lyue. If I had nothynge els / but these blyn∣de poesyes of his to beare me wytnesse / they were sufficient ynough. For soche blynde beggerye yet sawe I neuer / & so garnyshed with the scripturs. O bloderynge Balaami¦tes which stodye nothynge els / but to prouo∣ke the people to folowe youre whoredome. What Barnes was in the iuste quarell of
God agaynst youre blynde beastlye kynge¦dome of Antichrist / we are not so blynde but we knowe. And yf oure testimonye shulde fayle / the workes which he compyled are sufficient wytnesses to declare his godlye wytt and lernynge / of the which we haue seane more than .x. vndre diuerse tyttles. So blynde is youre popishe generacion that they neuer yet were able to answer one of them. Which of you all with youre dyrtye diuynite hath yet soluted but the least of his argumentes in his boke of prestes matry∣money or yet of the Masses abusyon? Naye / ye are non of those. It is ynough for you to crye heretyque / heretyque / whan ye playe nō other but an heretyques part yourselues. Neuer are you good in Christen disputaciōs but whan ye haue halters and fyre vpon youre syde. Verye blynde Asses ye apere now a dayes / for anye good lernynge ye shewe / & that is wele seane in the treatyse of Stan∣dyse / in Bonners declaraciōs / and in this worshypfull worke here of yours. 3 I praye you hartelye what swete pathes haue you founde out euer sens the yeare of oure Lorde a M. and one? In the which yea∣re was sathan youre great grandesyre sett at large by youre holye father Pope Syluestre y• seconde (which obtayned of him by Necro∣mancye / to be saint Peters vycar) to worke in the worlde all myschefe by you which are his ryght fashyoned members. I thynke the
wayes are wonderfull / yf we shuld laye th out here togither. Neyther haue you spared the nyght nor yet the daye to fynde out all fylthynesse. Ded not you fynde out the wor∣shippinge of Images / the prayēge to rodes / the knelinge to ladyes / the kyssinge of rely∣ques / the sensinge of aultres / and the sekin∣ge of shrynes / with soche lyke abhominacy∣ons? It is vnspekable what nombre of sow¦les ye haue lost by these & soche other path wayes of yours besydes your own wretched sowles. This ded ye neuer yet recant / by protestinge vnto your cures. Good people we haue ledde ye wronge wayes by these vn¦commaunded sacrifices & heythnishe wor∣shippinges. No / I dare boldelye saye before God and manne / that ye neuer yet repented it for all your oft goinge to confession / so far¦re are ye from grace and all godlynesse. The lorde of his great mercye delyuer ones his people of that malignaūt generaciō of yours For neuer shall they be but blinde / so longe as they haue yow for their gydes. 4 Here ye are not ashamed to accuse good Doctor Barnes that right disciple of Christ / that he neuer coude fynde the right waye vnto Christes lore. As who shuld saye the pathes that yow leade are the verye iust wayes vnto Christes lore. And this do yow write that the people shuld so beleue it. Lete vs pondre yowr doinges vpon your most prī¦cipall feastes of the yeare / as vpon cristmas
daye / good frydaye / easter daye / and penthe¦cost day. And so se whether they be soche wa¦yes as Christ hath walked or no. For whye / those pathes which he hath gone afore / are the onlye wayes to his lore. First ye haue e∣uen songe and compline in latyne withe the sensinge of your aultres to beginne the so∣lempnite with / & these path wayes Christ neuer knewe. The next daye folowinge ye haue mattens / prime / & houres in the same vnknowne language. ye haue holye water makinge / procession / and hygh masse with double sensinge of Images. ye haue at nyght ageyne euensonge and cōpline with sensinges. With these abhominable wayes and soche other was Christ yet neuer acqua¦inted. But he demaundeth of yow this que∣stion by his holye sprete in Esaye / who hath required these thinges at yowr handes? Cō¦cludinge with you / that his wayes are not your wayes nor yet his pathes. Therfor all your pretensed colours are false here. 5 Full true is the clause which ye haue here alleged out of Salomons prouerbes / sa¦uinge onlye that ye haue changed the tyme to come into the tyme present. Qui peruersi cordis est / nō inuenit bonum / saye you. And it is there. Non inueniet bonum. Who so hath an hart geuen to mischefe / shall in the conclusion wine no profight therbye. I mar¦uele ye toke not with it the clause next folo∣winge. Et qui vertit linguam incidet in m¦lum.
Lykewyse he that hath an ouerwhart tonge / shal come to a myschefe. This myght haue bene a premonishment for you / that ye shuld not thus haue raged to youre owne cō∣fusyon. Of a wonderfull nature are the scri∣pturs / that they neuer will serue you vnles∣se they be peruerted / mangled / & spoyled of sumwhat. This text here alleged agreeth better with no manne than with you. For I thynke the deuyll hath not a more peruerse stomake than you haue as youre frutes here declareth. I maruele ye marked not this in the chapter afore. He that disdayneth the poore / blasphemeth him that made him. And he that is glad of an other mānes hurt / shall neuer be vnponnished. Almost in the ende of that chapter / is this text for Barnes. Pre∣ciosi spiritus / vir eruditus. A preciouse spre∣te hath he that is lerned / speciallye of God. Though youre whole generacion denyeth him this / yet is it knowne to the Christen worlde by his godlye workes to youre vtter confusyon and shame. A mysterye. 1 But euermore By meane of ambycyon Ded so vve sedycyon. 2 He sayd certayne In vvordes playne. 3 It coude not be founde
That vve vvere bounde. 4 To be obedient. 5 Vir apostara iurgia seminat. Sap. 6. The openinge. 1. YDyotyshe and folyshe are youre poe∣syes euermore and full of blasphemo∣se lyes. Malyciouslye accuse ye here doctor Barnes of ambicion / which soughte nothynge lesse than ambiciouslye to regne after that maner of youre proude modye mu¦stre. Where as Ambicion is in his most pry∣de / there fynde ye no fawte with him. But there ye worshyp him with cappe / legge / and knee / and wolde kysse his arse to please him. To currye fauell he shall be youre singular good lorde / and a prelate most wyse and pre∣gnaūt / though he haue nomore godlye wytt than an ape. Thus at a tyme Ambicion shall be youre God / and yet to rebuke an other / ye can take him for a vyce. Oh vngodlye flat∣terer and false glosynge hypocrite. Lerne first to se that vyce / where it is most depelye regnyng / and correcte it in yours selfe whan ye playe soche an hypocrites part. For all youre crepynge and crowchyng to soche ydo∣louse shepeherdes / is for that swete Ambi∣cion whom youre hart so sore coueteth. And as concernynge sedicions and scysmes. Not one hath bene in Christendome notable the∣se D.CCC. yeares / but youre false genera∣cion hath bene therin the chefe doers / as all
the Chronicles mencioneth. What mysche∣fe ye ded ones in the cyte of London in kyn∣ge Rychardes tyme the seconde abought an horse lofe / it is shame yet to reherse / besydes that ye haue wrought there & in other quar∣ters of Englande euer sens that tyme. 2 He that doth speake the thynge that is true and certayne / & without false colours of cauteles doth vtter it in wordes playne / is moche better occupyed than euer were you yet. For that which you haue taught in the churche and yet do styll teache daylye / so but the verye doctryne of deuyls / so vn∣certayne and vntrue as they are. Nothynge els are youre histories of the Saintes but fables / lyes / and fantasyes taken out of Le∣genda aurea made by fryre Iames de vora∣gine. The promyses that ye make to the peo∣ple concernynge youre Masses / that some of them shuld be wholsom for the poxe / somme for the pestylence / somme for the ague / som∣me for the headake / somme for y• fwle euyll and soche other / are false and abhominably practysed of you to deceyue the simple for moneye. And lyke wyse youre frydaye fastyn¦ges / ladyes psalters / and rosaryes / with be∣des / primers / pyturs / candels / holye waxe & other wytcherye more. Neuer are the swe∣te promyses of the Gospell made playne vn∣to the people by you / but darkened euermore with youre hypocrites gloses. Neyther will ye entre into the kyngedome of God youre¦selues /
nor yet suffre anye other that wolde gladlye entre. All youre stodye is to vpholde those mytred Mahometes the Bisshoppes to maynteyne you styll in the kyngedome of fleshlye ydelnesse. And for that ye care not how manye Christen sowles ye murther. 3 As connynge as ye make ye in fyndyn∣ge / ye shewe youre selfe here but a false and a deceytfull sercher. ye saye first to Barnes charge that he sowed sedicion. This is no newe thynge in you / but an olde vsed prac∣tyse in youre craftye generacion. Of sedicion was Christ accused by the hyghe Prestes / yet caused they Barrabas that was the se∣dicion worker and a murtherer also / by their instaunt labour to be saued. Paule was com¦playned of to the debyte Felix to be a com∣mocion maker / not without the false coun∣sell of the Bisshoppe Ananias / yet was he a manne most peceable and godlye. Happye is Robert Barnes therfore with them so to be noted of. the same selfe sort. Playne are his wordes good manne / in all the workes he hath made / cōcernynge obediēce dewe both to God and to his prince. In all his wrytyn∣ges can not I fynde one clause of disobediē∣ce to eyther of them. Manifestlye declared he his obedience towardes God / in that he for his truthes sake forsoke all worldlye esti∣macion that he myght ele haue had / & at the latter ende gaue his lyfe for it also. And as touchynge the kynges mageste / his large
supplycacion vnto him directed / is a suffi∣cient wtynesse therof towardes him / besy∣des y• boke which he wrote vnto him in Lati∣ne cōcernynge the lyues of the Romishe Po∣pes. But it will here after apete some other obedience that Pantolab{us} complayneth of / than eyther of these be. 4 I perseyue by the circumstaunce of this matter / that the holye obediēce which Pan∣tolab{us} meaneth here / that coude not be foun∣de out of Barnes / smelleth towardes Rome. For it is a spirituall obedience belongynge onlye to his mother holye churche / which is no congregacion of the lewde layte / but of spirituall prelates / as his holye father the Pope with all his college of carde makers / arche byteshepes / and byteshepes / dockers / presters / and currates. These are the hyghe powers that he speaketh of here after / to whom he wolde haue vs so sore bounde to be obedient in peyne of deadlye synne / because that his honorable mastershyp myght be lo∣ked vpon also as a ryght worshypfull cura∣t amonge them / concernynge his tythes & offerynges. For it is an yll worlde whan the people will not knowe their dewtye to h¦lye churche. A great decaye is it to their ho∣lye mother that the cursynge sentence is go¦ne. This was the obediēce that doctor Bar¦nes coude neuer fynde in all the scripturs / & therfore meanes were sought out to haue him brent for an heretyque without exami∣nacion
of his articles. Where as yf he had acknowledged this / he had bene styll a lyue. Thus playe these Romishe gentylmenne / colle vndre the candelstick / cloynige vndre craftye colours to clought vp their false kin¦gedom of deuyllishnesse ageyne yf it may be The subtilte of the serpent is not yet all de∣ad / but lyeth styll lurkinge in their genera∣cion / to worke all myschefes. 5 Scripturs haue we non of this wret∣ched Papyst / but eyther they are wrasted / hacked / māgled / or els falselye alleged. Vir Apostata iurgia seminat / is here now brou∣ght in / whiche wanteth no lessethan .xvii. wordes of the whole sentence to serue his false purpose. And to amende the matter he noteth it the .vi. Chapter of Sapience / whe¦re is it is not so / but the .vi. Chapter of Sa∣lomons Prouerbes. His concordaunce the∣re deceyued him. For that onlye he sought for this text and not the Byble. And th{us} ly∣th the text there. Homo apostata vir inuit¦lis graditur ore peruerso / annuit oculis / te∣rit pede / digito loquitur / prauo corde machi∣na turmalum / et omni tempore iurgia semi∣nat. A dissemblynge persone / a manne myn∣dinge no goodnesse / hath all these propyrte∣ with him. He carryeth a deceitfull mou∣the / his eyes winketh wyles / his fete tra∣ceth toyes / he pointeth with his fingars / he is alwayes Imageninge euill / and in euery place cōmonlye he soweth discorde. To this
ende doth not Pantalabus bringe in this text here / but onlye to proue Barnes an apo¦stata for leauinge his fryres cote with y• Po¦pes obedience. And in this hath he shewed himselfe here in his owne right colours / a through Papyst in dede (I will not saye a rā¦ke traytour) to approue my coniecture afore. Easye is it to se what lyeth in the hartes of these pestilent poyseners of the people / whā the forsakinge of a pylde frytes cote is so wayghtye a matter with them yet styll. The sequele of that Chapter ded not Pantolab{us} marke / for his owne amendement & others. For he found it not in his cōcordaunce. Sex sunt que odit Dominus / et septimum dete∣statue anima eius. Sex thinges are there which the lorde hateth / and the seuenth he abhorreth without remedye. A proude loke a dissemblinge tonge / handes shedinge in∣nocent blood / an hart Imageninge euill / fe∣te that are swyft to do myschefe / a false lyen¦ge wytnesse / and he that soweth discorde a∣monge bretherne. In this clere myrrour he might haue seane himselfe in the hate of God / and a great sort more of his cumpany. A mysterye. 1 To the commanndement.

MAlice hath so blinded this imprudēt pratler / that he seyth not the waye he goeth in. And though he doth se it playne ynough yet doubteth he not the da¦ungers therof. And parauenture he nedeth nor neyther. For the wynker of wyles and y• seker out of subtyltees hath put him and his companye in assuraunce / that though they slyde a lytle in the darke / yet shall they cat∣che no scathe. For nought is it not that they daunse attendaunce / plainge placebo with Reynarde the foxe. At all tymes shall they be redye to geue warninge / yf anye parell be towardes their whelpes. Lete them do no∣thinge els in the meane season / but se alwa¦yes that the people obeye the commaunde∣ment of the high powers / meaninge by thē the spiritual prelates. And that they beleue as holye churche doth teache thē after the olde customes of their aūciēt elders / for the¦se newe falshyoned wayes are nothinge wor¦the. If any be busye with these newe bokes ageynst those hygh powers / lete them cause their sworne satellites to indite them of he∣resye.

Therfor it shall be mete at all houres & sea∣sons for him that will lyue in rest / to be obe∣diēt to these hygh powers / though he shuld for their obedience vtterlye forsake God and obeye the deuyll. For their obedience is non other. 2 A farre diuerse obedience is this frō al other. For it bideth vnto sinne / as witnes¦seth also the great wyse clarke Iohan Stan¦dishe in his treatise of reporche ageīst Bar∣nes. And I beleue it wele / for their lawes / commaundementes / and customes / to whō they wolde binde vs / are nothinge els but fylthye Idolatrye & sinne. Agreinge with y• sainge of Saint Paule. That is not of the faithe which Christ hath taught / is wicked∣nesse and sinne. I wote that of a craft they wyll saye here they meane the kīge / though they mynde nothinge lesse / but vndre that coloure to establishe ageyne the decayed a¦ctorite of their whorishe churche. Whye shuld Pantolabus els call Barnes here craf¦telye / an Apostata. That clause was not all brought in for nought. The manne ment sumwhat more thā he durst wele vtter. But where as he doth scornefullye axe this que¦stion / what Barnes ded winne by so disobe∣inge the holye fathers? I will answere it for him / bycause he is now dead. He hath won∣ne so moche as Christ promised him / which set him a worke. That is / persecucion / enpri¦sonment
and deathe. And trulye that was a swete winninge / for therwith hath he won∣ne also the lyfe euerlastinge. Who so euer will saue his lyfe (saith Christ) shall lose it. And he that shall lose his lyfe for my sake / shall fynde it ageyne in the lyfe euerlasting. Saint Paule sayed boldelye vnto the Phi∣lippyanes that deathe was vnto him a win¦ninge. And I knowe that the lyberall han∣de of the lorde is not yet abreuiated. 3 Now steppeth forth Pantolab{us} as brag¦ge a bodye lowse / and as one depelye lerned in y• scole of scornefulnesse / he soluteth his owne wyse questiō. He declareth to the worl¦de what Barnes dd wynne for not obeien∣ge holye churche / as though menne were ig¦noraunt therof. He telleth them with so mo∣che spight as he can wele Imagine / that Barnes was tyed to a poste in Smytfelde at London with .ii. companions more / and that he there ded roste. But he sayeth nothinge (I trowe) of the Popes .iii. sworne chaplay∣nes Powell / Abell / and fetherston his owne swete companions which were the some da¦ye & houre in the same selfe smithfelde both hanged and quartered for treason. No / that disobedience toucheth not Pantolabus. I tolde yow afore that he wolde at the last de∣clare vnto yow for all his craftye colours what obediēce he ment. O holy Rome holy Rome / thu spirituall Sodome and Egipt / moche beholden art thu to thy secrete louers
in Englande so workemāly to cloyne in thy cause. As concerninge good Robert Barnes whose ende is thought without honour of y• daintye babes of this worlde. He is counted amonge the dere children of God / and hath his porcion with the saintes. Though he se¦meth lost to y• vngodlye wise / yet resteth he swetelye in the peace of the lorde. As golde in the hote fyerye fornace tryeth he his ele∣ctes / and as a brent offeringe receyueth thē For soche matters passeth not after ye blin∣de iudgement of menne lyuinge here in wā∣tonnesse. 4 Alwayes is Pantolabus lyke him wc tempted Christ in the desart / whose Apostle¦ship he hath here deuoutlye taken vpō him. Styll vseth he his olde roberyes and leger∣demaynes with the scripture. Here geueth he vs a mangled texte of Saint Paule to the Romanes / appointing vs the .viii. chap¦ter instede of the. xiii. If it be not honest playe and cleane conueyaunce / I report me to yow. Omnis anima potestatibus subdit¦sit sayth he in both his coppyes but subli∣mioribus is out there / for seruinge his spiri∣tuall purpose. Lete euerye sowle (sayth he) submit it selfe to the powrs / but the hyghar powers he nameth not / least he shuld haue mencioned the kynge / myndinge nothinge¦lesse. For he is the hygher power / and God is y• hyghest of all. Powers without hygher or hyghest are alwayes indifferent / & maye
be iudgled with / & therfor he putteth them here for the Prelates of his churche. But Saint Iohan sayth in the Apocalyps / that their powers are of the Serpent / which ga∣ue his auctorite and seate to that beastlye Antichrist of theirs. Whan Christ spake of worldlye powers / he ernestlye charged his Apostles to obeye them / but in no case to ta∣ke them vpon them. I wondre of the blynde∣nesse of Pantolabus / that he perseyueth not what foloweth in the same Chapter. Nemi∣ni debeatis quicquam / nisi vt inuicem dili∣gais. Lete nothinge be donne amonge yow but in mutuall loue / sayth Saint Paule. Le∣te charite be the power that yow shall occu∣pye / for that fulfylleth the lawe. If this po∣wer regned in Prelates / and were so well taught of them as it is commaunded / ney∣ther shuld the hygh powers haue so moche a do in ponnyshinge theft / whoredome / and murther / nor yet so many of their spirituall swarme be whoremongers / murtherers / & robbers of the common people as they are.

¶The openinge. 1. Excedinge hote and modye is this mā¦ne styll in his matters / and wyll not haue done with Barnes yet for a lyt∣tle. He now describeth his standinge in the fyre betwixt Garade and Hierom. But he telleth not which of his own generacion hin¦ge that daye in the myddes / of powell / Abell & fetherstō. No / that pleased him not so wele as this. For these were fryndes to his holy father of Rome / where as they were enemi∣es. His eye syght therfor serued him not so wele vpon this syde as vpon that syde. The Popes enemies are the onlye heretiques in his Genealogye here / and not the enemyes of Christ and his kynge. Be that farre from him to iudge those good vertuouse fathers of holye churche any heretyques. No / I wa∣rande you / Cardinall Pole / fryre Peto / fryre Buckenham / & other ranke papistes abrode / are yet non heretyques with him / but relygi¦ouse vpholders of that holye mother of his the churche of Rome. Truthe it is that Tho¦mas Garade a bachelar of diuinite and per¦son of honye lane / was tyed to that poste v∣pon his ryght syde / for preachinge ageynst Antichrist. And that ded Christ afore tyme promise hī in Peter for a rewarde / yf he wol∣de be a preacher in his kyngedome. Whan thu wert yonge (sayth he) thu gyrdedst thy¦selfe / & walkedst at thy pleasure. But whan thu art olde / thu shalt streche forth thy han¦des /
and an other shall gyrde the / leadynge the contrarye to thy mynde. And therfore this was vnto him a promysed rewarde of his master / which had no better of the worl∣de his selfe. 2 If Garade were a brother of Barnes / of a lykelyhode he was non than of Panto∣lab{us} brotherhede / as were Abell & Powell. For yf he were / he wolde nor regestre him for an heretyque. But I putt the case that Garade & Barnes both be now of that bre∣therhede which God the father hath allo∣wed for his sonne Iesus sake / as it is most lyke to be so. For that heretage in Christ is not promysed vnto them which lyue here in wanton pleasurs and are murtherers in cō∣tempt of the Christen veryte / but vnto tho∣se despysed disciples that are persecuted & scorned / and that suffre death for thesame. What shall become than of Pantolab{us} and soche other disciples of Antichrist / which hath with so villenouse spyght refused that bretherhede / yt is easye to cōiecture / yf they deolye repent not in tyme. Happye is Tho∣mas Garade that euer he was borne. Not onlye in that he taught Christ here for an onlye sauer without the mangye merytes of menne / but also in that he hath with his owne dere lyfe / sealed as a sure wytnesse vn¦to the same agaynst Antichrist. This singu¦lar profyght hath he all redye gotten therby That he shall from henceforth neyther hon∣ger
nor thirst / and that God hath wyped awaye all teares from his eyes. Neuer mo∣re shall he tast of death / of losses / nor yet of sorowes / for the first sorowes are past. Now is he sure to be allowed for a fre cytezen in the newe Hierusalem / whan his lorde shall sytt in the regeneracion. 3 Pantolabus yet styll to conferme his doctryne with blasphemyes and lyes / alle∣geth here the .xvii. chapter of Ecclesiastes / otherwyse called the preacher / and the who∣le boke hath nomore but .xii. chapters in all. I warande yow the manne meaneth sum∣what by it. In dede this clause: Vna enim cathena tenebrarum colligati erant / is in y• xvii. chapter of Sapience. But I maruele sore where omnes is become. He was sure∣lye layed asyde for some cloynynge purpose. That chapter is all togyther of the sore iud∣gementes of God / concernynge the Egyp∣cyanes. They were all bounde (sayth the wyse manne) with one cheane of darkenesse. And this was for that they thought styll to haue in subieccion his holye people. Saint Iohan sayth in the Apocalyps that youre spirituall cye or holye mother churche is now that Egypt and Sodome. I praye God ye do not condempne him for an heretyque. He sayth there also that ye shulde in youre firetes throwe forth the bodyes of the lor∣des wytnesses / but ye shulde not suffre them to be layed in graues. Me thynketh he is

Propter hoc in∣disciplinate anime errauerunt / &c. for this cause onlye do menne erre / that they will not be reformed (lorde) by thy wysdome. For that shall they be wrapped in the cheances of longe darkenesse. Their sorceryes and in∣chantmētis shall come to derisyon / & their proude wysdom shall be brought to shame. A mysterye. 1 And on the lefte hande One Hierome ded stande. 2 One of that nest As blynde as the best. 3 And thus they thre Novv burned be. 4 Ipsi sibi grauiores tenebrae. Eccless. 17. ¶The openinge. 1. I Ngenyouse wolde Pantolabus apere in this descripcion / leauynge oute no cir∣cumstaūce of doctor Barnes burnynge. Now bryngeth he forth Hierome the perso∣ne of Stepnaye / declarynge him to stande vpon his lefte hande / as though it had not bene knowne afore. But fetherstone he for∣getreth which was a ryght brother of hi /
& was hanged there for treason the same sel¦fe daye. ye heare him not tell here on which syde he honge. As for the kynges matters he passeth not gratlye vpon them / but holye churches matters are an other maner of thynge. He will not describe a trayterouse Papist / least he shulde so st forth his owne propre ymage. Wyllyam Hieriome in dede / a bachelar of diuynite also / & a manne elo∣quentlye lerned / for the veryte preachynge agaynst Antichrist / stode on the leftehande of Barnes in the fyre and was brent with him to ashes. And blessed is he that euer he had a lyfe so to bestowe agaynst that abho∣minable kyngdome of yours. That fyre was vnto him but a delyueraunce from miseries / restorynge his sowle to that quyet which he hath now in Christ Iesu. Not the more vn∣pure was that offred vp treasure which the lorde left with him in an carthn vessell / though the vessell were scorfled in the heate of that flame / but the moche more oriēt and precyouse. For matters stande no a fore god as yow do iudge them / but as he hath deter¦myned them by his holye worde & promyse. 2 To enlarge his poesyes with some blyn∣de thetoryckes / he sheweth that Wyllyam Hierome was one of that nest. But what that nest is / he declareth not / but leaueth it all blynde / as he is alwayes a blynde leader. A nest in the scripturs hath both a good ori∣gynall and a godlye significacion / though
Pantolabus here mocketh with it for want of good lerninge. By the wysdome & apoint∣ment of God was it first fashioned / & sum∣tyme it betokeneth the true churche / sumty∣me the conscience of manne. The false coun¦terfet churche which Pantolabus here ma∣inteyneth / is no wholsom nest in dede / but y• insaciable chaos or bottomlesse pyt that S. Iohan speaketh of / whiche hath darkened the sunne that is Gods worde / and sendeth forth nothinge els but a fylthie smoke of tra¦dicions & of mennes lowsye lerninge with an innumerable swarme of their lecherouse locustes. As are mytred Byshopes / Gorgio¦se Prelates / Prestes smered with grese / sha¦uen sorcerers / and chaplaynes disgised lyke disardes in a mommerye in manye straūge kyndes and colours. Who can with lesse ho¦neste call a man blynde / than he that is blin¦de all togither? Of all that Pantolab{us} hath here taught in this Genealogye / is not one scripture trulye applyed nor yet after anye honest sort declared. But as a blinde sorge∣on or dogge leche / he hath turned it all into one blynde eyesalue to blynde menne all to¦gither. True is it in him that Saint Iohan ded saye. Though the lyght doth shyne in the darkenesse / yet wyll not the darkenesse receyue it. Moche water cometh by the myl (they saye) that the myller taketh not in. 3 Now cōcludeth Pantolabus his lon∣ lowsye circumstaunce conceruinge Do∣ctor
Barnes and his companye / shewinge vs hete that all they thre are burned. And not a lyttle glad is he and his generation therof / for so moche as they thre ded them so deadlye noyaunce by their preachinges. It cost them no small stodye to bringe it to pas∣se / nor yet small diligence and labour to ha∣ue it so to their mynde. But yet had they wt it a sowle displeasure / for so moche as there were the same selfe daye & houre .iii. migh∣tye captaynes of their holy assemblye / han∣ged and quartered for treason / before the sa¦me selfe people. Lyke as the deathes of the∣se. ii. companyes were diuerse / so were their opinions and causes. The one sort dyed for Christ / the other for the Pope. For vphold ¦ge of Antichrist was powell / Abell / and fe∣therston hanged. For helpinge downe his kingedom was Barnes / Garade / and Hie∣rome burned. Fortunate are they which suf∣fred for Christ / for their rewarde is sayed forth in the scripturs and promises of the lor¦de. For the other is there neyther scripture nor promise. Though they were most greuou¦slye tormented before menne / yet was their hope full of immortalyte which now they fe¦le ineffect. Their sowles are now in the hā¦des of God / and sure to suffre nomore tormē¦tes. Though they semed before the vnwyse to dye / yet are they nw in a lyfe moche bet∣ter. As sunne beames shall they shyne in y• daye appointed / and iudge y• nacions which
are now vnfaithfull. 4 Wele maye that spyghtfull spiritual t be called the kyngedom of Antichrist or be¦asiye bodye of Sathan / as the Apocasyps doth name it / for their beastlye workinge. I thinke the deuyll of hell coude not more vn∣reuerently and mockingly handle the sacred scripturs / than this wreched fellawe doth. For here he bringeth in a text. Ipsi sibi gra¦uiores tenebre / which he hath both spoyled of wordes / astered in sentēce / and distroyed for the true vnderstandinge / puttinge / the nominatiue case for the ablatiue. And bycau¦se he wolde be behinde with vs in no point of falshede / he hath sent vs to seke it in the .xvii. Chapter of Ecclesiastes / and there is no Chapter so called in the whole Byble. In dede in the .xvii. Chapter of Sapience I fynde this clause. Ipsi ergo sibi erant gra¦uiores tenebris. yea / they were worse vnto them selues (sayth Sapience) than anye o∣ther darkenesse possible. This was at that tyme spoken for the Egipcianes / and now it extendeth to yow Papystes folowinge them in the same selfe steppes of Idolatrye. The cause whye ye do so dāpnablye erre / is that ye will not be reformed by the wysdō of God as the beginninge of that Chapter specify∣th / but ye take your owne wayes in all thin∣ges. Frequenter enim (sayth he) preoccupāt pessini / redarguente consciencia. Oft ty∣mes do they those wicked thīges / that their
conscience rebuketh them of Whan ye haue practised deceyt / spoken lyes / exercysed fyl∣thynesse / done the innocent to deathe / with soche other feates / your myndes are not al∣wayes in quiet. In token wherof ye go oft to confession / yet are your lyues seldon the bet∣ter. A mysterye. 1 I feare me sore There vvyll come more. 2 Vnto that ende Except they amende. 3 Vix corriguntur impij. Eccle. 1. ¶The openinge. 1. OVt of no small charite aryseth this feare of Pantolabus / least anye mo∣re shuld come to the ende of Barnes / or be brent in the fyre as he was. yea / so bro∣therlye he tendereth that matter / and with so moche Christen loue / that he wolde not greatlye care to be the first that shuld accuse a true Christen beleuer yf he knewe his fay∣the throughlye. As moche py hath he in those matters / as hath eyther the foxe vpō the chyckens or the wolfe vpon the lambe. I wolde that Pantolabus shuld take care for his olde showes yf he hath them / and not for Christes dere members. For they must entre heauē by the strayght gote as he ded / & not by the brode waye which leadeth
to destrucciō. They must suffre hatred / wrō∣ge / spyght / vengeaunce / yll reportes / perse∣cucions / exyle / curses / lyes / blasphemies / enprisonmētes / hyrst / hongre / and deathe of their bodies / for ryghtousnesse sake / el shall they not be lyke mēbers to their head For his spouse is a churche that suffreth / & not the prde gentyll womā that, mustreth with myters / canapees / copes / crysmatory∣es / crosses / cruettes / and candelstyckes. A compnye of bretherne there are vnderneth the aulter (as Saint Iohā reporteth which daylye calleth to y• lorde to haue their blood reuenged of that gorgiouse apareled gentyl woman (which is dronken with the excesse therof and their nombre must be fulfylled with soche poor sowles. And tyll that be fy∣nished / there must daylye folowe more / n remedy. 2 Moche doubt hath Pantolab{us} for this ende. But he had more nede to take care for himselfe / least an halter be bewixt him and his ende. For he hath so plentuouslye deser¦ued it as hath anye other ranke Papist of that affinite / yf this Iest of his be but indif∣ferentlye wayed. As for those good menne (whom he hee moste cruellye blasphemeth without lerninge) though their deathes we¦re not verye preciouse in his folyshe iudge∣mēt / bycause he is ledde of a contrarye spre¦te / yet were they right pleasaunt to their lor¦de God / in whose kyngedom nowe they rest
with Abraham / Isaac / and Iacob. If they had dyed for fellonye / murther / whoredom / or treason / I wolde with Pantolabus haue iudged their deathes verye yll. Se that non of you suffre (sayth Saint Peter as an homi¦cide / thefe / or yll doe. If anye manne suffre as a cristiane / lete him not be ashamed ther¦of / but glofye God in that behalfe. For wt∣standinge the false kingedom of Antichrist in the beiytees quarell dyed they / as it is e∣uident to all ryght iudgementes / and ther∣for their deathes are gloriouse. The amen∣dement which Pantolabus requireth here / concerneth the obedience of that malygna∣unt mustre of those mitred mahoūdes / whō he wolde in no wyse to decaye. But lete him set his hart at rest / for the lorde is almost at a point with that wretched wytcherye. 3 Vnplesaūt euermore are the scripturs to Pantolab{us} / and that apereth wele by his monstruouse handelynge of them. Here brin¦geth he in to cōferme his purpose / a ragged patche out of the first chapter of Ecclesia∣stes otherwyse called the preacher / but not as it is there spokē. For here it is / Vix corri¦guntur impi. And there it is thus / peruers difficie corriguntur. A verye harde thinge is it (sayth he) to make the croked strayght / or the frowarde wele disposed. Parauenture he hath made this alteracion here to shewe himselfe copiouse in the latyne speche. For most commonlye the papistes are full of ay¦ne
glorye. But it is alwayes yll spede / whan pryde goeth afore and shame cometh after. But I thynke verelye this text folowynge was in his waye whan he made that change Ecce magn{us} effectus sum / & precessomnes sapientia &c. Loke vpon me wele / for I am a great wyse prelate. I haue gote more wys∣dome than they which went afore me. For soles manye tymes haue soche ymaginaciōs of theemselues. More mete were it both for Pantolabus and soche other to consydre by that chapter of Salomon / that all which is vndre the sunne / is but vanyte / the worde of the lorde excepted. And in so doynge / he shuld wele perseyue that all which he and his generacion here maynteyneth / is but fyl¦thynesse / dyrt / and poyson / nothynge furde∣rynge the sowle of manne / but destroyenge yt rather. A mysterye. 1 For vvithout doubte There is a rovvte. 2 Of these same slepers And corner crepers. 3 That vere a fayre face In euerye place. 4 Multos enim supplantauit nequitia il¦lorum. Sap. 19. The openinge. 1.
in preson also after the death of Iames / we∣re glad to absent themselues for a tyme / & in diuerse howses to playe the corner crepers. This therfore is non of youre seuen dead∣lye synnes. 3 Nothynge agreeth this that foloweth here / with that which went afore. For he that is a sleper beareth no fayre face a brode so longe as he is a sleper. Neyther is he sea∣ne in euerye place / which is a corner crepet. Wherfore these rhetorycall poesyes of Pan∣tolabus semeth verye folyshe and wytlesse. He shuld apere a moche better Poete / wolde he ones leaue the companye of dame igno∣raunce. Trulye she is manye tymes to nygh his elbowe whan he setteth his penne to the boke. Lyke as she is also with Doctor yncke pott otherwyse called Iohan Standyshe. A fayre face hath youre holye mother y• chur¦che of Antichrist borne outwardlye in euery place / with copes / crosses / ceremonyes / and sensynges. yet doth the scripturs call her a verye whore and the Synagoge of sathan. And that fayre face of hers was first repre∣sented as a preuyall signe / in him which was the first head of the Rome churche by the permissyon of Phocas the false emprour For his name at that tyme was Bonifaci{us} / which is as moche to saye as bona facies / a good face or a glosynge pretence of counter∣fett holynesse. The dowter of a mourthere is that holye mother of yours / therfore must
she be geuen to murther of verye nature. For Phocas trayterouslye slewe his master Mauricius which was the Emprour afore him / & so entered into his rowme. In token that she shuld destroye the Empyre / & mayn¦tayne her estate by murther. 4 I thynke verelye that Pantolab{us} will neuer be at other poynt / but styll peruert the scripturs / and sende vs to Hierico to seke them. Soche a mockynge wretche harde I neuer of / dayes of my lyfe yet / neyther amon¦ge Christianes nor Paganes / infydels nor deuyls. Here he taketh a spoyled text / Mul∣tos enim supplantauit nequitia illorum. And he appoynteth vs to seke yt in the .xix. chapter of Sapience / where as yt is but the iii. chapter of Ecclesiasticus or of Iesus Sy¦rach. And there yt standeth thus. Multos e∣nim spplantait suspicio illorum / & in va∣nitate detinuit sensus illorum / and are spo∣ken vnto them which are to curyouse in the serche of Gods hydden secretes. The med∣lynge with soche mysteryes (sayth he) hath begyled manye a manne / and tangled their wyttes in vanyte. If his syght had serued him wele / he myght haue founde after in that chapter for a farder vnderstandynge of that text / this clause also. Synagoge super∣borum non erit sanitas / &c. To the Synago∣ge of the proude pampred vp porkelynges shall be left no helthe. For the synne that is planted in them / shall be roted out / and yet
shall yt not be perceyued of them. But the hart of him which hath vnderstandynge / shall perceyue thynges verye hygh. The di∣lygent are will harken to wysdome / and the hart that is wyse shall haue persyght intel∣lygence. The godlye prudent will absteyne from vyces / and increase in the workes of ryghtuousnesse. A mysterye. 1 yet are they as frovvarde And as vnto vvarde. 2 As the other vvere Of vvhom ye ded here. 3 For vvithout doubt It vvill not out. 4 That is bred by the bone. ¶The openynge. 1. ALwayes is Pantolab{us} one manne / styll yet blasphemynge these poore innocēt sowles. True is that Lorde of his wor∣de and promes / which tolde them afore han∣de that they shulde alwayes haue the worl∣de an aduersarye. And that they shulde loke for non other frutes of gentylnesse therof / but scornefull rebukes and slaunders. In cō¦fyrmacion of this / Saynt Iohan sayth also in his reuelacion / that as the true preachers hath at anye tyme fynyshed their faythfull testimonye or massage / the beast that came
out of the bottomlesse pyt (which is the gre∣at bodye of Sathan or swarme of Antichri∣stes broode) shuld euermore make warre a∣geynst them / and styll ouercome them as cō¦cerninge the body / their faythe remayninge alwayes inuincible. Here doth Pantolabus (which is a maliciouse membre of the same mad mustre) report the true seruauntes of y• lorde to be verie frowarde in opinion & full vntowarde in faithe to his mynde. They be leue not the newe articles which his holye churche hath taught of Saintes / Images / relliques / ragges / rotten rodes / confessiōs / Masses / suffrages / diriges / purgatorye / pro¦cessions / pylgrimages / and pardons withe soche other bastlye beggeryes for their aua¦untage. But euermore blessed be the eternal name of that lorde for so visytinge his poo∣re people with knowlege from aboue / which hath taught them to abhorre that fylthines¦se / wherin is nothinge els but dampnacion. 2 As a naturall membre of the afore na¦med bodye of Sathan / doth Pantolabus she¦we himselfe here. For lyke as the seyd Sa∣than accused Iob before the lorde / and hath bene euer sens an accuser of owr bretherne in his members / so doth Pantalabus nowe accuse them also / as one naturallye geuē vn¦to the same feate. They are as frowarde (sa¦yth he) ageynst holye churche / and as vnto∣warde to do anye thinge to her commodite / as the other sort / that is to saye / frith / Lam¦bert
Barnes / and soche other were afore / of whom ye haue harde here in this worshyp∣full Genealogye. Of them in dede we haue harde sufficientlye that they coude in no wy¦se awaye with the whoredome of your holye mother in her Idolatrouse ceremonies and sacrifices. If these be now in the same selfe takinge also / we haue cause moche to reioy∣ce / and to geue hygh thankes vnto God so to delyuer thier consciences from your Ba∣bilonishe burdenes. It is a full manifest to∣ken that his persecuted churche is not yet all dead / but that he styll lyueth in his tro∣bled members according to his iust promes and shall do to the ende of the worlde. For the churche that is his dere spouse / is not gloriouslye painted out to the worlde withe golde / syluer / preciouse stone / & pearle. But inwardlye decked with faythe / hope / chari∣te / and the rightousnesse of Christ. And out∣wardlye she is adourned with calamitees / veacions / most slaunderouse rebukes / and deathe. 3 Glad are we to heare it / that the er∣nest sprete of Christ is not yet extinguished in them for all yowr most cruell assaultes of penaltees / inprisonmentes / famishemētes / halters / swerdes / faggottes / fryre / and all other tormentes els. A remnaūt is there yet lest of them which hath not bowed their kne¦es to yowr false God Baal. To them hath the lorde promised a crowne of lyfe / yf they
perseuer stedefast to the ende. For these do we praye dayly with teares wt are a brode in exyl / that they do not swetue from that ste¦defast rocke at the venemouse suggestions of your fylthye generacion / as some fleshly wantons hath done now of late to their sow¦les detriment. Better had it bene for them that they neuer had geuen that is holye to dogges and swyne after Christes premoni∣shementes / than thus shamefullye to beco∣me swyne with them and so to treade his pre¦ciouse pearles vndre their fete. For in so de¦nienge the lordes verite before menne / they haue shewed themselues what they are / euē the flesshlye louers of themselues / and vn∣worthye of Christ. More harme haue they done than they which hyd the lordes treasu¦re / neuer openinge their mouthes to decla∣re it. Those are they which are neyther ho∣te nor colde / whom the lorde hath promised to spewe out of his mouthe / or vtterlye to re¦iect them from the eternall hertage of his / clerlye racinge their names out of the boke of lyfe / yf they repent it not sore. 4 If those good creaturs (whom Pātola¦b{us} here spyghtfullye reporteth) cleaneth fast vnto their bone / we are greatlye ioyfull ther¦of. For a more manifest token cā not be that they are Christes members than that. By that inseperable saythe apere they to be his naturall spouse in dede / a bone of his bones and a rybbe of his rybbes. Now are they by
that meanes become his own dere mēbers / his misticall fleshe and bodye. He that shall now persecute them / shall persecute the ap∣ple of his eye / so dere and preciouse are they vnto him. For their faithfull perseueraūce make we daylye intercessions with teares from our hartes / which are now dispersed or scattred abrode in the regions of Samaria and Iudea / for the persecuciō that is at Hie¦rusalē. With the wiges that the lorde hath graciouslye geuē vs which are his wordes and examples ded we flye into the wylder∣nesse / so sone as we perseyued that the rode Dragon vometed waters to destroye the say¦the which we gat by his worde▪ ye shall be persecuted (saith Christ) from cyte to cyte. For yf they haue persecuted me / they shall also persecute you. But as they shall pursue yow in one cyte / flee yow alwayes into an o∣ther. Not onlye was this Christes counsell but he ded it also in effect. He fledde into Egypt in his yowthe / he declyned from the malice of his enemies / and he absented him¦selfe from the Iewes. In that wyldernesse hath he prepared for vs as he ded for Helias to fede vs there for the space of a thousande ii. hondred and thre score dayes. A mysterye. 1 For though they be gone. yet is there behinde That are as blynde.
2 As the other before Vvhich kepe in store. 3 Full close and pryuelye Their cankered heresye. 4 Stultorum infinitus est numerus. Ec∣cles. 1. ¶The openinge. 1. NArrowlye doth Pantlabus loke to his matters now / least all wolde away frō his holye mother / to the great detry∣ment of his popishe lyuinge. Though frith / Lambert / Barnes / and soche other be gone / yet are there (he sayeth) of the same sort styll remayninge / as yll to his generaciō as they Whose blood he wolde haue his holye mo∣ther to drinke / so bloodthurstye is the spiri∣tuall hart of the manne and zelouse in her quarell. He is verye glad that his good gra¦ciouse lorde of wynchestre doth sturre so we¦le aboute him as he doth. He turmoyleth in their kynde these newe Gospell readers / to cause all Englyshe menne to abhorre Chri∣stes testament / but vnto the Stewes of Lō∣don he is a full gentyll benefactor and foun¦der. Not onlye doth he leaue them vnrebu∣ked of verye tendre sauer and loue / but also full fatherlye he mainteyneth them with y• lordelye wages of his seruauntes / and sum∣tyme with the delycates of his owne table by the lyberalite of them. I thinke this fa∣therlye beniulence of his / is for some res∣pect
that he hath to the common welthe / or els to qualyfye the great heates of his hote howsholde / which euerye where tosseth lyke termagauntes with the blood of oure lorde / the sowle / the hart / the fleshe / the bodye / the bones. This is the holye Gospell that he maynteyneth. Blynde are they called here of Pantolabus / which will not folowe these vertuouse rewles to the vpholdynge of their markett in confessyons at lent. But the eter∣nall father delyuer his flocke from the abho¦minable blyndenesse of them. 2 Non can ryghtlye se after the blynde opinion of Pantolabus / vnlesse they be led∣de blyndefelde in the darke / by the sprete of his holye mother. She must sett vpon their noses y• spotted specularyes of her olde tra∣dicions and customes / or els is yt nothynge worth. If they shulde be now without their Latine houres (wherwith neuer manne yet was Christenlye edifyed) their Christen re∣lygyon were clerelye lost. If they shuld not haue their accustomed wainlynges in the temple / their processionynges / their sensyn∣ges / their holye water swyngynges with so∣che other ioyes of olde Troye / they wolde thynke that heauen were out of the worlde and hell comen home to their dores. This is the syght that Pantolabus requyreth / non other wolde he the people to haue / least they shulde in a whyle be moche godlyar wyse than he. This houglye syght despysed Io∣han
Wyclef and Iohan Husse. This fyl∣thye syght contempned Mariyne Luther & Melanchton. It was nothynge for the ap∣petyte of Oecolampadius and zwinglius / with soche other more. And that is the verye cause whye they are regestred here of Panto∣labus for heretyques. These are they that were blynde afore / because they had not that syght of his holye mother. And they which cometh after kepeth now yet styl in store the same selfe blyndenesse in his folyshe opi∣nion / and therfore he is not contented with them / but wolde verye fayne haue them bur∣ned for heretyques yf yt myght be. 3 Afore grefe is yt to the stomake of Pan¦tolabus / that anye shulde be alyue which fauoreth not the Pope. This parauenture will be rekened a slaundre / but the denyll of lye yt is. What other is yt but to preferre a manne / whan we magnifye his workes? Are anye other thynges called vpon here than matters of Papistrye? No verelye. Not one poynt is sought here of Christes clere insti∣tucion. Neyther his holye Supper nor Bap∣tym / compassion of y• poore nor mutuall cha∣ryte / nor yet the true preachynge of repen∣taunce by the Gospell of saluacion. But he∣re seketh Pantolabus with all power possy∣ble to holde vp Antichristes kyngedome for fallynge / and that with the most spyghtfull omempt of his Christen bretherne which is but a fylthye buyldynge. For more encly∣nynge
to Christes clere veryte than to their vnwolsom Papistye / he accuseth them here most malyciouslye of preuye vpstorynge and close enclosynge togyther of cankred here∣sye. As though the Gospell of y• lorde (which they haue receyued as his onlye power to saue them) were most cankred and pestylent heresye. Thus do they to cause the people to abhore yt / and to brynge the worlde in an yll opinion of them that oweth yt fauer. Non other is the nature of soche execrable lou∣stes / which are crept out of the smoke of the bottomlesse pytt / but alwayes to stynge / hur¦te / sle / and destroye all that is grene vpon the earth. All that hath receyued anye quye∣kenesse of beleue by the worde of the lyuyn∣ge Lorde / wolde they wyther vp to the fyer of hell. 4 True is the clause of Ecclesiastes that Pantolabus here allegeth for a full confir∣macion of his matter / yf yt were trulye be∣stowed. Stultorum infinitus est numerus. Of foles is there an infynite noumbre or an innumerable sort. This was not spoken for the small flocke of Christes persecuted mem¦bers / whom the worlde reputeth for foles / for they are but fewe in nombre. Manye are called (sayth he) but verye fewe are chosen. But this was first vttered for that pleasaūt¦lye disposed multitude of this worlde / whō God hath reputed / and styll doth yet repute foles in his scripturs, The noumbre of those
foles are infynite in dede / and their swarme innumerable. Of his faythfull seruauntes doth the Lorde knowe the noumbre / for he hath their names wrytten in the boke of ly∣fe. But of these ruffelynge rutters he kno∣weth no noumbre / for his knowlege most cō∣monlye is his acceptacion / which they shall neuer enioye. Wysdome had yt bene for Pan¦tolabus to haue consydered this text there also. Vidi cunca que fiunt sub sole. Et ecce vniuersa vanitas & afflictio spiritus. I be∣helde all thynges (sayth the wyse manne) done vndre the sunne. And I perceyued we∣le they were all but vanyte and vexacion of mynde. By this myght he haue consydered / what his folyshe Papistrye is / not rysynge of the expresse worde and commaundment of God / but of the syckle fantasyes of men. That yt is but mere vanyte and madnesse / and that the obseruacion therof is execra∣ble fylthynesse. A mysterye. 1 But I praye God To spare the rod. 2 And that vvith hart They maye conuert. 3 And call for grace Vvhyle they haue space. 4 Dum lucem habetis, credite in lucem, vt filij lucis sitis. Ioan. 12.
¶The openinge. 1. By all puyshe pathwayes of Papistrye hath Pantolab{us} wandered here / & at the last he playstreth vpp his pedla∣rye poesyes / and falleth full vndeuoutlye to his prayer. He desyereth God without that fayth which riseth of his veryte / to spare that rodde which he neuer yet threttened vnto manne. For the crosse of contynuall persecuciōs which cōmonlye lyghteth vpon the elect members of Christ / are not thret∣tened vnto them but promysed with his eter¦nall rewarde / yf they faythfullye beare them Only are plages threttened to the disobe∣dient breaes of the Lordes commaunde∣mentes. And those plages are the verye cur¦ses of God / where as persecuions for his truthes sake are his most wholsom blessyn∣ges. Blessed are your (sayth he) whan mēne reuyle yow / and falselye report yow for my names sake. For great is youre rewarde in heauen. A moche better waye therfore were yt for Pantolabus and for his bloodthurstye generacion / to leaue their murtherynge vp of innocentes / and to repent from the hart their manyfolde myscheues past. And that ones done / than to praye vnto the Lorde in faythe / to withdrawe from them that ven∣geaunce of innocent blood she dynge which hangeth ouer their heades as a perpetuall plage / rodde / or scourge of eternall damna∣cion. Thus doynge they myght beccome of pu¦blycanes
true Apostles with Matthew / & of cruell murtherers faythfull minysters with Paule the elect vessell of God. 2 Charytable wolde Pantolabus gladlye apere / now that he hath spewed out all his poyson and myschefe agaynst y• true seruaū∣tes of God. A fayre colour sett they alwaye vpon the matter / be their workynges neuer so vengeable. And in that they agre with their spirituall head the serpent / which tem¦ptynge Eua / shewed a bewtyfull face out∣wardlye with swete and pleasaunt wordes. Whan they sytt in their consistoryes vpon condempnacion of the innocētes with Cay∣phas / they outwardlye pretende all godly∣nesse. They first call vpon the name of God openly protestyng that they haue his ryght honour before their eyes in all that they go abought. They sweare also vpon the holye Euangelyes / that they will there do nothyn¦ge of displeasure / hate / percyalyte / nor ma∣lyce. Yet is the poore innocent in the ende cō¦dempned / accursed / geuen to the deuyll / dis∣graded / fyered / and burned / onlye for his fayth in the Lorde Iesus Christ. Neuer the more is Pantolabus here to be trusted / that he prayeth so bytterlye for their conuersyon. For abhomynable is that charyte which fo∣loweth of so moche malyce as he hath afore here vttered / and that apereth by the fyl∣thye frutes therof. Not vnto Christ and his holye verytees wolde he haue them here
with all their hartes to conuert / but vnto the Antichrist of Rome by a newe obedience of his olde cankred customes whō their lor∣de God doth detest and abhorre. This is y• dissemblynge charite of this worme of way wardnesse or maliciouse membre of Sathā. This is the conclusion he seketh. 3 Fayne wolde Pantolabus haue them to conuert to that false obedience of Anti∣christ / that he might lyue lyke a gentylman and haue his dishes the fatter / and his pur¦se the waghtyer. Oh / it is a pleasaunt thinge to haue the people on both sydes of the way salutinge them with cappe and knee. It is a good syght / (saye they) whan the flocke fo¦loweth the shepeherde / and y• parryshynes their curate. yea / but alas what is it whan the lambes folowe the wolfe / which is a cru¦ell thefe / a destroyer / and a murtherer? For whose grace wolde Pantolabus haue Chri∣sten menne to call? For the grace of holye churche / of his holye father the Pope / of his good lorde of Wynchestre / his good lorde of London. His good lordes of lyncolne / yorke and Durham / with soche other ghostlye fa∣thers. If he meaneth the grace of God / I maruele that he forgetteth himselfe & his owne generacion. Me thinketh they ought in soche prayer / to be had most in remembra¦unce / consideringe they are fardest of all mē¦ne frō his grace. yf they seke not for it whil they haue here space and layser / it wyll be wyde with them whan they shall come ones
to their strayght reakininge. But they thyn∣ke it safe ynough / so longe as they haue y• Po¦pes powr still in their handes / wt / Ego absol¦uote vndre a stulticia a stole I shuld saye. For yf they maye geue grace vnto others / they haue grace ynough for themselues / & so haue lyttle nede of Gods grace. 4 Manye a manne (they saye) shall vt∣tre the thinge which he vnderstandeth not / lyke as Pantolabus doth here. And as we haue for example of Balaam / kynge Saul / Cayphas / and Pylate / whiche prophecyed they knewe not what. Dum lucem habetis (sayth he) credite in lucem / vt filii lucis si¦tis. Whyle ye haue the lyght / beleue on the lyght / that ye maye be the chydren of lyght. This hath he borowed of the. xii. Chapter of Iohā to clought vp his matter / yet doth he not knowe what it meaneth. For yf he ded he wolde not persecute that lyght as he hath done here most spight fully. The light that is there mentioned is the lordes eter∣nall worde / which Pantolabus with soche other craftye cloyners calleth heresye / and wolde haue the people so to esteme it. But y• lyght that he wolde haue thē to beleue / is y• faythe of his holy mother with y• olde croked customes of her Papistrye / and that is no lyght but darkenesse most dampnable. Om∣nis qui credit in me / in tenebris non mane. Non that beleueth in me (sayth Christ in y• same selfe Chapter) abydeth in that darke∣nesse / meaninge therbye the doctrine of hy∣pocresye
or of outwarde obserucions inuen¦ted by mēne. This promised he there to cast out with the prince of this worlde / by the mightye aperaunce of his worde / whiche shuld iudge those infidels also at the latter daye. The cause whye they se not this light nor beholde the misteryes therof / is that he hath blynded their eyes and hardened their hartes for their vnbeleues sake least they shuld be saued. A mysterye. 1 And for this tyme Here endeth my ryme. 2 The Genealogye. Of stynkynge heresye. ¶The openinge. 1. ACcordinge to the head and bodye / hath Pantolabus here fashyoned vs out a tayle. He hath geuen vs as folyshe a cō¦clusion / as he gaue vs a processe afore. And for this ryme (he sayth) thus endeth his ry∣me / as though he were mynded here after to compyle more fumouse workes. As for this / it had made no great matter yf it had ended before it beganne / for anye witte / grace / or good lerninge is in it. For non other frutes it containeth but the cruell contempt of our Christen bretherne and abhominable peertinge of the scripturs. I call them Chri¦sten bretherne for the porcion that they haue
in Christ / wherof no worldlye power can depryue them / though they maye take from them both bodye / goodes / and lyfe. For god is of no soche malyce as is manne neyther is he displeased alwayes whan manne is di¦spleased. But euermore is he mercifull / whā he is called vpon in faythe. He receyued the thefe whan all the worlde had forsaken him and geuen him ouer vnto deathe / moche mo¦re his faythfull seruauntes which suffreth for his veritees sake. The tyme that Panto¦labus here speaketh of is full wretchedlye bestowed / and that he shall wele knowe / as he shall geue the accountes therof. As for his tymes what they are / we nede not to de¦scribe them. For they euerye where declare the insipient head and the Idell brayne of their fantasticall author / sumtyme to short sumtyme to longe / with barbarouse termes / and more barbarouse matter. What his ryme is in qualite & quan∣tite / and what it contayneth in lengthe and in bredthe / he manifesteth here in these .ii. verses folowinge. Confessinge them as he shuld do / to be his owne propre goodes / and he by them to be a stinkinge heretyque in de¦de. For he sayth that his ryme / which is a frute of his own propre popyshe faythe / witt and stodye / is the Genealogye of stynkinge heresye. Ergo he must be a stinkīge heretyq̄ / no remedy. For the tree in goodnesse is all one with his frute / and alwayes the frute de¦clareth it. For a ranke Papyst and Antichri¦stes
great frynde had we neuer knowne Pā¦tolabus / had not these papysticall Poesyes so vttred and declared him. To stinkinge a matter is it to go vndre y• kynges pryuylege Ad imprimendū solū to y• vtter poyseninge of his people / the Scripturs so shamefullye torne / and their truthe so deuilyshlye peruer¦ted. yet is it no mruele though this herety∣que Pantolabus doth vtter soche pestilent poysons / consyderinge that a worme of that nest and a locust of that lake / canne geue nō other commodite. A mysterye. 1 Vvherin I requyre. And humblye desyre. 2 All menne y vvys. That shall rede this. 3 Aboue all thinge. To praye for our kynge. 4 Domine in virtute tua letabitur rex, & super salutare tuum exultabit ve∣hementer. Psal. 20. ¶The openinge. 1. LAst of all now cometh Pantolabus in his humble requestes / as lowlye as the foxe whan he seketh his praye / and as false as the fryre whan he stodieth to decey∣ue. But marke his rhetoricall style / how ma¦nerlye it passeth here. Wherin (sayth he) I requyre. That is to saye / in that stinkinge
heresye (for that goeth inmediatlye afore) to praye for the kynge. Is not this (thinke you) full workemanlye handled and lyke a preg∣naunt Poete of the Popes pultrye / thus to regestre his kynge in the Genealogye of stin¦kinge heresye as he calleth it. And to desyre his subiectes to praye for hī in y• same stiking heresye also? Abhominable is that prayer / whiche riseth out of so stinkinge a desyre. Is not Pantolabus (suppose ye) a pure han∣ded artyficer and a cleane fyngered gentyl∣manne / that so can polyshe his poesyes? yes verelye is he / and lyke one of the scole that he cometh from. In the mart that he occupy¦eth / shall ye fynde nonother wares. All that is there done / commeth out of stinkinge he∣resye / yf antichrist their Pope be an herety∣que. For all that they do in their churche as yet / are his dyrtye leauinges / not one obser∣uacion bournisshed with the verite of the lorde. If Pantolabus hath no better thinge to bestowe vpon his kynge but a prayer ma∣de out of stinkinge heresye / it were best for hi to kepe it styll vnto himselfe. For he hath no nede of that curse of God / for all their blessinges are curses / and their prayers syn¦ne after Malachias Prophecye. 2 Certayne / verelye / and ywys cometh neuer into owr meters / but whan we lacke matter and wytt to fulfyll them / as I tolde yow afore. ywys master Pantolabus the gre∣at grounded poete of the Popes greasye gra¦uell
pyttes / requireth all menne that shall reade with a good deuocion to Antichrist / this Genealogye of stinkige heresye (which he hath of an ydle Idyotes brayne compy∣led to pondre his good zele vnto holye chur¦che / & to praye for the kynge whan they may wele intende it. For it is no gret good deuo∣cion that here moueth him vnto prayer that waye / but that he must nedes saye sumwhat though it were but for maner sake. Great pyte were it but the manne shuld desyre to haue readers of his worke / it is so notable. As full is it of good Christen erudicion / as a dogges date is full of swete honye. How shuld they be stinkinge heretyques / styff nec¦ked scysmatyques / and obstynate Papistes / yf they shuld not reade soche pratye Poesy∣es amonge. Lete no manne thinke other wy∣se but that Pantolabus and soche other intē¦deth sumwhat by soche subtyle workeman∣shippe. The Bisshopes winketh at it / as though there were in it non heresye / whan it is all stinkinge heresye by their owne con¦fession. They are wele contented whā they playe soch bussye partes / and wyll not be ac∣knowe of it / but leteth them alone. If anye of them leape so farre that he is hanged vp for treason / they care lyttle for it / for they thinke thy haue so lost but a knaue. 3 After a farre fett style / and curyouslye compassed processe / cometh Pantolabus at the last to his full desyre. Exhortynge all
menne to praye here for the kynge / with as lyttle true deuocion as he that myndeth no∣thynge lesse. And yt maketh no matter ney∣ther. For moche better yt is to be vnprayed for / than to be prayed for out of stynkynge heresye / as all their Papistrye is non other. The prayer which ought to be made for kyn¦ges & for them that are in auctoryte / ought to aryse of the sacred scripturs whereof they haue their auctorytees / and not out of syn∣kynge heresye as yt is here requyred. Saynt Paule exhorted Timothe / which was no papistycall masse sayer but a preacher of the Gospell sufferynge daylye persecucions for the same / before all other thynges to praye for kynges and for all other which were in hyghe power / that Christes disciples and true beleuers myght lyue vndre them a pea∣ceable lyfe in all godlynesse. And this is our prayer also with contynuall teares. Wherin we desyre the lorde for his eternall mercyes sake / alwayes to preserue him. But oute of stynkynge heresyes we praye not for him / neyther out of Mattenses nor Masses / euē∣songes nor complynes / which are the verye frutes of the Beast of Rome / least we shulde by those blasphemouse prayers brynge vpon him the great indignacion of God. The fru∣tes are euermore all one with their tree in goodnesse / as those fylthye obseruacions with their first fylthye begynner / haue they neuer so fayre colours of gods seruice / gods
owne worde / Christes Gospell / the vttera∣ce of his name / with soche other / yet are they abhomynacions vnspekeable after that ydo latrouse handelyge. 4 So farre are these blynde Papistes from the true sprete of Christ / that nothynge they ryghtlye vnderstande of the scripturs. This text of Dauid: Domine in virtute tuletbitur rex / & super salutare tuum exul∣abit vehementer: Perteyneth alone vnto Christ / and not to anye earthlye kynge. For in that whole Psalme is described his triū∣phaunt glorye / with his reuengement ouer them wt hath him persecuted of cruell hate & spyght. Christes humanyte is it / that is so ioyfull of the strengthe that yt hath gotten / which is the Godhede. That is yt which re∣ioyseth so ernestlye / & is so excedynge glady for the sauynge helthe of mankynde which yt hath by y• gyft of God obtayned. He hath his hartes desyre with the ful request of his lyppes / which is the eternall mercye of the Lorde. That manhode was preuented with lyberall blessynges / & now yt hath a crowne of immortalyte. He axed lyfe for him and for his / & lyfe was geuen him for euer and euer. Magna est gloria eius in salutari tuo / &c. His glorye is great / Lorde (sayth Dauid) in that sauynge helthe / and compassed he is now of the / wt eternall felycite. Soche moc∣kers as is Pantolabus shall ones fele his hande / ones will he fynde out all them that
so spyghtfullye hateth him. As an hote kyn∣deled ouen shall they at that daye apere / the fyre euerlastynge will deuoure them for euer ot ashamed is this dissemblynge mocker and pestylent hypocrite / in his glosynge flat teryes ydolatrouslye to abuse his Prince. For what is ydolatrye els / but a worshyppe geuen to a creature / which peculyarlye be∣longeth vnto God. And full therof is all the seruyce / homages / and doynges of the Pa∣pistes / the Lorde ones delyuer all Christen princes from them. A mysterye. 1 And the quene also Vvhere so euer she go. 2 And for the sauegarde Of oure prince Edvvarde. 3 Vvhom I praye Iesu Longe to contyne vve / Amen. The openinge. 1. ERnest is Pantolabus yet styll in re∣questes sprynggynge out of his gen∣tyll Genealogye of stynkynge here∣sye. For therin he homblye requyreth all these thynges by his owne confessyon afore. Herin he desyereth the dilygent readers of his worke / to praye for the quene also / which was sumtyme called the ladye kateryne ho∣warde.
He shulde seme to be some blynde chaplayne of hers / by the blynde zele he she∣weth here. For he wolde haue her remem∣bred where so euer she go / in the waye or out of the waye. Trulye that prayer were of a straunge kynde / yf yt shuld so be made as yt is here requyred. Who hath harde prayers made for menne to go where they will / or whan they are out of the ryght waye to con∣tynue so styll? I thynke fewe menne lyuynge I wolde haue no soche querestre of Baals quere / nor yet soche a chaplayne of Bels col∣lege to praye forme / as poore a man as I am Moche better grace parauenture had bene hers / yf she had chaunced of no soche ghost∣lye fathers. For where as the scripturs are / contempned / & their verytees sett at nought what els can folowe but vyce? which al∣wayes requyreth an yll ende. The true loue of Gods worde / is neuer without his feare. Neuer can that creature outragyouslye of∣fende / which foloweth the true lyne therof. A anterne to oure fete is that worde of the Lorde / and a lyght vnto oure pathe wayes in this shadowe of deathe / the eternall fa∣ther geue vs his grace to folowe yt. 2 Fynallye Pantolabus exhorteth all his readers to praye for the sauegards of our most worthye prince Edwarde. If this we∣re out of the Genealogye of stynkynge here∣sye / as yt is also therin / yt were moche more pleasynge vnto God. He abhorreth all that
is straunge / and not lyke fashyoned to the exemplar that he hath left in the scripturs. He turneth awaye his face dysdaynouslye from all mockynge sacrifyces inuented by menne and not commaunded of him. As is the Papistycall Masse with all other blas∣phmouse obseruacions of that montruou∣se madame / the athanycall Synagoge of Antichrist. Nadab and Abihu the sonnes of Aaron the hyghe Prest / were consumed in the Lordes wrathe / for offerynge sraunge fyre vncommaunded. Accursed is he which addeth his owne inuencyon vnto the Lor∣des seruyce / or anye thynge els that the scri∣pture commaundeth not. I counsell therfore all faythfull beleuers / syncerelye to praye in sprete and in veryte after Christes holye doctryne / for their most worthye kynge and the prince his naturall sonne / that the one maye succede the other as Salomon ded Dauid / & as Iosaphat ded Asa / in the fayth∣full wayes of the Lorde. And this haue they good cause to do yf they remembre all thyn∣ges. As their delyueraunce from the greate Golye of Rome / with sufferaunce to reade the scripturs which is their syngular sow∣le helthe. What though some of them at ty¦mes be brent in the fyre for Christes testy∣monye / through the Bisshoppes olde tyran∣nye. Nothynge is there lost / but their corrup¦tyble bodyes. Wheras he suffreth one bodye in their malyce so to peryshe / he saueth that
owle and a thousande more by the fredome of Christes Gospell. Blessed be the Lorde therfore that euer he was borne. 3 I coūsell no manne to make this prayer with Pantolabus nor with soche other exe∣crable Papistes / so damnablye vayne in the corrupt practyses / stodyes / and deuyses of their wretched hartes / though yt semeth ve∣rye good and godlye. But praye after y• scrip∣turs with y• dere heretage of Christ / which is a churche persecuted as he was / and not pampred vp here in pryde and in vayne glo∣rye. It is a congregacion not knowne to the worlde nor regarded of fleshlye lyuers / no∣more than he was knowne and receyued of them whan he came into his owne. Praye all from within / as that churche is from within lyke as Dauid wytnesseth with all the Apo∣stles and Prophetes. And lete this be youre specyall prayer for youre kynge and prince euermore. Thu eternall God of our fathers thre distyncte persones in one euerlastynge Godhede. Thu omnypotent father and crea¦tour of all. Thu eternall sonne and redemer Iesus Christ. Thu euerlastynge holy ghost & conforter equall vnto them both / all one God in power / substaunce / and nature of the Godhede / for thy tendre mercyes sake haue respect vnto oure kynge and yonge prince. And lyke as thu hast of thy munyfycence and lyberalyte geuen vnto them the impe∣ryall crowne and scepture of Englande.
So graunt them to lyue in thy feare / to wal∣ke in thy worde / and to do that is ryghtouse in thy syght euermore. Graunt them also Lorde with the swerde that they beare / that they carrye yt not in vayne / but alwayes to the ponnyshment of the yll doers / and to the syngular solace of thy faythfull seruauntes. For so is thy eternall will. Thus ought true subiectes to praye without all hypocresye / dissymulacyon / and glosynge flatterye. A mysterye. 1 Cōpyled by Ponce Pātolabus 2 Imprynted at London In Pater noster rovve. 3 At the signe of our ladye pytye By Iohan Redman Ad imprimendum solum. ¶The other coppye. 4 Imprented by me Robert Vvyer. Ad imprimendum so∣lum. ¶The openinge. 1. NOw shuld soche a famouse worke / made in defence of holye churche / apere nota∣ble vnto the readers therof / except the name of a notable clarke (as master Panto∣labus is) were putt ther vnto? fytt is yt that the carpenter shuld stande by his carpētrye / and the buylder by his buyldynge. A broken
wall of Babylon hath Pantolabus dawbed vp here of old fauer and loue / but his dyr∣tye dawbrye holdeth not. For lyke an vn∣worke manlye dawber he hath done yt with vntempred claye / contrarye to all godlye ad∣monyshmentes. Most dampnably hath he peruerted the sacred scripturs here / to mayn¦teyne his Popyshe malyce agaynst all Chri∣sten charyte. But Hieremye / Ezechiel / Mi∣cheas / and Abauk / with other holye Pro∣phetes / byddeth him and soche other to sett their hartes at rest. For the cyte which is buylded with blood / and the howse that stan¦deth by vnryghtousnesse / shall not alwayes contynue in the worlde. I shall cast donge in youre faces sayth the Lorde by his Prophe∣te Malachias) euen the verye donge of you∣re solempne feastes and ceremonyes. And yt shall cleaue fast vpon you and take you with yt to eternall perdicion. What Ponce Pan∣tolabus is (which putteth himselfe forth he∣re for y• Author of this Iest) I nede not to describe. For the verye worke it selfe setteth forth his lyuelye ymage. It manyfestlye de∣clareth him a braynelesse babler / a presump∣tuouse ydyote / a frantyck Papist / a peruer∣ter of the scripturs / a stynkynge heretyque / an enemye to God / a secrete louer of Anti∣christ / & a preuye conspyrer agaynst his prin¦ce for the Pope. 2 Moche accordinge to the ryght natu∣re therof / is the settinge out here of this he¦retycall
Genealogie. Abhominably blasphe¦mouse it is / and therfor it passeth forth vn∣dre some tytles of abhominacion. It is seyd first of all to be imprinted at London / which is a most noble cyte. Verye sorye I am that so¦che sylthye frutes shuld come from so wor∣thye a place. Notwithstandinge I ascribe not this partycular euyll to that worshyp∣ful cyte / wherin (I knowe) to be people most vertuouse and godlye. But of this am I cer∣tayne. Though Hierusalem were holye and the verye cyte of the lorde allowed by the scripturs / yet was it in conclusion most gre∣uouslye ponnyshed for sufferinge blasphe∣mers / and for vnthankefullye receyuinge of Christ and his verite. Pater noster was wont to be a most wholsom prayer / ordayned and commaunded of Christ to dwell onlye within mannys sowle / and from thens to be sent in dayly massage to the eternall father of heauen. And now he is becomen an out strete dweller) the name of a lane / or the sy∣gne of a tauerne. Farre is he changed from Christes first institucion / ad from the offi∣ce that he appointed him. A farre meane change from a pylde popyshe ceremony / wol¦de be called a great heresye of y• Bysshoppes. What this is I leaue it to yowr coniecture. 3 In this Pater noster rowe / or in bede¦alleye whether ye wyll / was this Genealo∣gye imprinted / at the signe afowr ladye py∣te. What that pyteouse ladye is I can not
tell / but wele I wote she hath no ust tyttle to be called owr ladye. No true fygure is she to Marye the mother of Christ. For neuer was she so farre from the ryght faythe / that she sorowed so largelye for that thīge which was vnto vs all most necessarye. I knowe she neuer wept so vndyscretely for the dea∣the of Christ / which was owr vniuersall hel¦the / but most hyghly reioysed therin. If she euer mourned / it was for the synnes of the people / and for that she sawe his veryte con¦tēpned of the cruell clergye / as it is yet styll. They therfor which worshyp that sorowfull pyte of Marye / do honour that infydelyte wt she neuer had / and make them therof an I∣doll. Thus is the sygne that Iohan Redmā dwelleth vndre / an exercrable Idoll / and he for so magnifyenge her with that tyttle / a verye Idoll worshypper. The lesse marue¦le is it / that soche fylthye frutes cometh out of his howse. Here is he not ashamed open∣lye to confesse / that he hath sett his handes to most wycked Papystrye / and vnto an hea∣pe of peruerted Scripturs / to the great dys∣honour both of God and of his kynge. Adioy¦ninge ther vnto his pryuylege / Ad imprimē¦dum solum / the rather to infect his people. 4 Now foloweth Robert wyer / & he gra∣unteth also by his owne handye worke / that he hath promoted forewarde these Popyshe Poesyes and Scripturs abhominablye per∣uerted. Wherin he hath done all that hath
lyen in him / to assure the kīges faythfull sub¦iectes to geue their good hartes to y• Popes olde faythe. An vngodlye cruell waye were it / yf menne ded but mynistre that thinge wt shuld but poyson the bodyes of the people. What shall we than recken it / whan that fylthynesse is ministred of them / which in∣fecteth their sowles to eternall deathe. So∣che is the vnsacyable thirst of thē that are couetouse / that they care not what mysche∣fes they do to get money. If the deuyll had geuen them a matter ageynst Christ / as his sworne Chaplayne hath done here ageynst his true seruauntes / and haue monyed them wele / they wolde surely haue done by that / lyke as they haue done by this. And the daye wyll ones come that they shall fynde it all one. The kynges priuylege. Ad imprimē¦dum solum / is put to the same / to bringe him also vndre the selfe same curse / of God / yf anye chaunce for it at the latter daye (whom he defende) so good subiectes are thy vnto him. By soche diuersite of printes is it easy to perseyue that the sale hath bene great & the profyghtes therof plentuouse. If the wor¦ke had bene Godly / yt neuer had gone so fre¦lye abrode / nor with so moche fauer of y• Bys¦shoppes. The lorde ones be mercyfull to his afflicted famelye / and delyuer thē frō their mycheues. Amen. ¶The conclusion. ¶Expreslye is it here to be seane (dere frynde in the lorde) what Pantolab{us} was at the makinge of this iest / and what manye
other are yet styll in the same synefull lyne of Antichrist. I perseyue by him and soche o∣ther more / that Leuiathan had than great strengthe in his loynes / to sende forth soche sturdye babes. Not longe afore that they hydde their heades / and durst not be seane abrode. But thā ded they on their mothers shamelesse face / and were ageyne as brag∣ginge as in their Popes tyme. Small harme is it to them that the Beastes head was wo∣unded / it is so wele and workemanlye heal∣led vp ageyne. Not to Christes glorye haue they fashyoned thē a newe churche now af∣ter the Gospell preachinge / but after their owne vayne glorye ageyne yet for aduaunta¦ge. Destroyed yet vtterly shall that execra∣ble mōstre be within short space (trust vpon it) by y• only breathe of y• lordes eternall mou¦the For now doth he call to remembraunce the blood of his elect Seruauntes whō she hath slayne & seduced to establyshe her kyn∣gedō of lyes & abhominaciōs.
