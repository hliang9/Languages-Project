should be forthwith sold here, according to the foregoing directions: It is therefore further Enacted and Provided, That for such particu∣lars of the premises as the said Contractors shall finde to be of that nature, they or any three or more of them may treat and agree with any Merchant Adventurer or Forreign Merchant, about transporting such of the said goods into any Forreign parts where they may be sold at the best rates, and either by immediate sale there∣of to such Merchants, to be by them transport∣ed and sold as their own (in which case the Con∣tractors may give such day or days for payment, as they shall finde needful and convenient, for the better improvement of the price) or else by hiring the Transportation of such things into Forreign parts where they may best sell, & there procuring them to be sold for this State, the said Contractors are left to take the best course they can, according to their best skil & judgements, to sell such things to the utmost advantage of the Commonwealth, although it be in a way differing from that which is before in general directed for other parts of the premises, Any thing in this Act contained to the contrary notwithstanding. Provided always, That no such particulars of the premises be sold to Merchants here, or trans∣ported into other parts, to be sold at any rates lower then by the aforesaid apprizements they are valued at, and so as the money for which they shall be so sold, be paid with all possible expedition in to the same Treasury hereafter mentioned, for the use hereafter appointed: And the said Contractors, or any three or more of them, shall be, and are hereby authorized to chuse and ap∣point a Clerk-Register, and such other Officers or Agents as they shall think fit and finde need∣ful,
for the better discharge of the trust, and dis∣patch of the service hereby committed to them; and for their own, and their Agents and Offi∣cers pains and charges therein, shall have five pence in the pound allowed them out of all such moneys as shall be made by sale of the said goods and premises, and out of the moneys to be raised, levied and received for and as the forfeiture of any buyer or buyers, making default as afore∣said in non performance of his or their bargain; which allowance of five pence per pound, shall be paid by the Treasurer hereafter mentioned un∣to the said Contractors, or to whom they or any three or more of them shall from time to time ap∣point to receive the same for their use, by warrant under their hands & seals to the said Treasurers directed; out of which allowance they are to sa∣tisfie all and every the Agents and Officers by them to be imployed in this Service; and to de∣fray all other charges of the same (except for Transportation and Sale of such particulars as shall be sent into any Forreign parts as afore∣said, to be there sold) the charges whereof shall be allowed and satisfied out of the improvement of the price of such particulars above what they would yield, if sold here. And it is further En∣acted by the authority aforesaid, That Humphrey Jones, and John Hunt, Gentlemen and Citizens of London, shall be and are hereby constituted and appointed Treasurers for all and every such sum and sums of money as shall or may be made, raised, levied and paid, by vertue of this Act, or any thing therein contained; and shall re∣ceive and safe keep all such moneys, and issue out the same for such uses, by such warrant, and ac∣cording to such directions as are in this Act ap∣pointed or prescribed, or shall further by authority
of Parliament be prescribed and appointed, and not otherwise; and of all the moneys so received and issued out shall keep, and when there unto re∣quired by authority of Parliament, shall render a just and true accompt, and faithfully observe and perform all such things as by this present Act, or any thing therein contained; and accord∣ing to the true intent and meaning thereof, the Treasurers of the moneys aforesaid, ought to do, observe and perform, and for their pains and charges therein, and satisfaction of such Clerks or other agent and assistants as they shall finde needful to employ therein, shall receive and have the allowance of two pence in the pound, out of all and singular the moneys to be received and accounted for by them as aforesaid, which al∣lowance it shall be lawful for them out of the said moneys from time to time to detain and keep, and the same shall be allowed upon ac∣count: And although most of the Goods and Premises, having been of old belonging to the Crown, and not to the persons of King, Queen or Prince, and now belonging to this Common∣wealth, the proceed upon the sale of them might justly be disposed of for publique uses, yet consi∣dering the many debts owing from the persons of the said King and Queen, and from their said Son, contracted before the late Wars, and due unto divers persons that are not Delin∣quents, but have constantly adhered to the Par∣liament, and suffered for the same, and many of them so necessitous, as that their condition can∣not bear the want of their said debts, The Par∣liament hath thought fit, and do hereby Ordain, That the moneys to be raised by sale of the said goods and premises, shall be imployed and dis∣posed for and towards the satisfaction of the
debts aforementioned, and of such of them especially as were contracted for necessary houshold expences; which debts shall be paid out of the moneys to be raised as aforesaid, as far as the same will go, in such maner, and by such proportion, as by authority of Parliament shall be hereafter directed. Provided always, That the sum of Thirty thousand pounds out of the first moneys to be raised by such sale as afore∣said, shall by the Treasurers aforementioned be issued and lent unto the Treasurer of the Navy, for supply of the present uses of the Navy; and the said Trustees, or three or more of them, shall direct their warrant or warrants for that pur∣pose, unto the Treasurers aforenamed; which said sum of Thirty thousand pounds, shall be∣fore the second day of May, One thousand six hundred and fifty, be restored and reimbursed by the Treasurer of the Navy, out of his receipts for the Navy, into the hands of the Treasurers named in this Act, for the uses therein declared. And for the better discovery and ascertaining of the sum, and several conditions of those debts, for satisfaction whereof the said moneys are designed as aforesaid, Be it further Enacted by the authority aforesaid, That the said Trustees, or any four or more of them, shall be, and are hereby authorized and required to receive such Informations and Accompts concerning the debts aforementioned, as shal be tendred to them, or any persons concerned (whom they shall or may examine upon oath, touching the truth and condition of the same) and also by warrant un∣der their hands, to call before them any such per∣son or persons, who have any books of Accompts or writings, or can give any further Informa∣tion or Evidence concerning the same, and them
to examine upon oath touching the truth, nature and ground of any the debts so informed of; and whether the same, or any part thereof hath been paid, and what remains due; as also to examine concerning the conditions of the creditors, & time of the debts contracted, & for what the same were respectively; and upon such examination, to make & certifie to the Parliament or ye Councel of State, a true list & accompt, or several lists and accompts of all such of the said debts as they shal finde to be of the condition aforementioned, expressing the several sums appearing due, and for what and when Contracted, and whether the persons to whom the same become due by assignment or o∣therwise, appear to be Delinquents or friends to the Parliament; and whether they have lent or advanced any Money, Plate, horse, Arms or furniture upon the Parliaments Propositions, before the 24th day of March, 1642. and whether they have constantly adhered to the Parliament, or suffered for the same; and whether their condition be necessitous, so as they cannot bear the want of their said debts; and of such debts, and to such per∣sons, the said Trustees are specially to make a distinct list and certificate, as they shall finde to have been Contracted for wages or sallaries to Servants, or for other necessary provisions of Chamber, houshold or Stables, to the end it may thereupon the better be determined, which of the said debts shall be paid, in what order, and by what proportions; whereupon the Parliament will determine and take order for the payment of such of the said debts as shall appear most just and equal, as far as the proceed of the said goods will extend.
