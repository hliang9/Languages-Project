To the faythfull Christians. VVHen the Gentiles heard the Law, they gaue this testimonie of the Iewes, in that be∣halfe, Deut. 46. Onely this people is wise, and prudent. No maruell: for,Psal. 19. 7. The Law giueth wisedome to the sim∣ple. Psal. 19. 7. It is perfect: ForDeut. 6. 25. it is our righteousnesse be∣fore the Lord.Pro. 3. 8, 9. It is also plaine to him that will vn∣derstande. Then seeing these Lawes areDeut. 10. 4. Tenne, andDeut. 5. 22. God added no more: Deu. 12. 32. Neither must we put any thing to them. Euery Psal. 119. 96. Commandement must of force be exceeding broade. The meanes to vnder∣stand their breadth, Mo∣ses hath set downe, when he sayd:Exod. 20. 1. Then GOD SPAKE all these wordes. The word, SPEAKE, is to proclaime with ma∣iestie: when then hee spake All; there is like maiestie in All. Then, what maiestie is in any one Commandement, is to be translated into eue∣ry one of the rest. Remem∣ber to keepe the Saboth: yea we must remember to keepe euery Law. Haue no other Gods before his face: yea, do all that is right, and no euill in his sight. Honour thy Father and Mother, that thy dayes may be longs yea, keepe all the Laws, that thy dayes may be prolōged. Once in deed, in the Law, for breuitie is set one maie∣stie, where soonest it would be missed: not for once; but to be trāslated into euery one, as Moses doth, where he expoun∣deth the ten Comman∣dements. For the ease of those that hunger af∣ter righteousnes, I haue digested the Comman∣mentes in this Table. Meditat, & so may you profite, that you may (in a maner) reduce the whole morall scriptures to these ten Comman∣dements; not without a singular delight to him that loueth know∣ledge. Enioy this, and studie it a while; and shortly (God willing) I will further helpe you herein, by a most fami∣liar explanation. Christes vnworthie minister, that desireth your edification. W. S.
