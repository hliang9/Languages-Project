How the love of God is the true ground of hatred of sin. NO man can hate sin in the ground thereof (as it is of∣fence to Gods Spirit) but in the love of God; yet there may be and is hatred of sin (that is Justifiable,) before the love of God is known, and felt, and dwelt in, and that manner of hatred of sin came up under the Law, and stands under the same (to wit, the Law-without;) where men may read such and such things were sin and offence to the Spi∣rit of God, and so believe what others have said thereof, and never come to the Spirit of God in their own hearts and particulars, that the offence and sin is against, and the love of that may be ignorant of: for that which is sin and offence to the Spirit of God, is also an offence and burden to, and on the creature and creation of God (in which this Spirit dwels, and is to be manifested in the Image, and Authority, and Dominion of God placed in his creature:) And as No man can serve two masters, but he will hate the one and love the other, or cleave to the one and despise the other: So is it in this particular of servitude; that though sin would be a master, yet the truth being received in the love thereof, and God obeyed in the heart and mind of the soul; he that is Lord in the Members, and therein hath a Law (warring against the mind and its Law,) is hated in that mind, and warred against by the man (that possesseth the whole frame,) though it may be a thorn in the flesh, and may have power to buffet, to shew the creature his weaknesse, and that he may not be exalted above measure: But where sin is loved in the heart, though the truth may be received (in that man,) yet it is held but in the unrighteous part, and the prayer is not heard, because of a regard to iniquity therein, but the subjection to God (in that state) is but for wraths sake, and so a child of wrath and fury, and against such is wrath revealed from Heaven; though that which leads into an extream in the passionate part (against that in others which is Lord at home, and which they seek to rule by as they are ruled) is as rea∣dy to lead out into the affectionate part (in any extream self may therein be pleased, and rule as Lord:) And this is a state under the Law, in which the woman would rule, and that which defileth usurp Authority, the feet abiding not
at home, nor the house kept in good order, but a tatling abroad, and the busie body becomes the complainer, and all is in a hurry, and a continual brawling, that the man gets to the top of the house, and nothing of the husbands advice is took, neither is he learned of; though the creature may be learned to cry out against that which others hath declared to be sin and evill, and may have a creaturely wisdom to discourse the offence to the Spirit of God (as so laid down by men,) but the more the creature is seen in this work, the less is God honoured, and self the more set up and exalted: Therefore that this woman may know her place and state, it would be good for her to know she is under the Law of her husband (as long as he liveth,) and let her shew him love by obedience (that is better than sacrifice,) that she pretends relation to, least he be yet found alive, that gave the bill of divorce (because of the hardnesse of thy heart;) and thou not free to be married to this other, even Christ; free from the Law of her first husband; for The froward shall not dwell in the house for ever, neither shall the complainer inherit good, but a bond-slave shall be their Lord, and they both shall possesse trouble: And she to hate that which he controles, is the fulfilling of the Law, and a subjection that answers the state of a Prophet in God, the spirit of the Prophets being the informer, until the creatures own be subjected in such a state. For which cause this Lesson (of the love of God) is worthy to be heeded and learned by all professors and professions, and submission, and subjection to the will of God, (under all tryals,) that hath pati∣ence for its rule, and fo: bearance for the shoulders, on which the work thereof is laid and built, that honour and respect the work and creature therein (in the Lord;) in that though it is become an easie thing to get words of truth, yet no man knows the mind thereof, but by its spirit, and who is in the life of its love: but whoever is in the enmity and hatred of the creatures life, are in the enmity and ha∣tred of God, and against his Spirit, because Gods life is in his crea∣ture (in whom they live, move, and have their being,) and therein he determined to rejoyce and delight; and where this love and delight dwels, it is manifested to the world (by their loving their brother they see, without which God could not be seen or known;) for it is the love of God in the heart that flows forth into the world (in charity and every good work,) but where is envying, and strife, and malice, and every evil work, the wrath of God abideth and resteth (on and in that soul) and how then can the love of God be known that
is thereby crucified and over-powred, and the delight over-born, by the worldly sorrow and discontent of spirit that works death?) In these particulars is weight to the serious hearted, that have known and endured the wrath, anger, and hatred of God (in the re∣surrection of the witnesse and testimony of his spirit, that first made against them) in the angry, wrathful nature of enmity and hatred against his Spirit, and its leading and guidance, in which all things come forth in fury and full of rage, and not in the winning overcom∣ing power of God, though service for, and to God (in reference to the subjection of what is in his way) may be, and is, in such a state, until liberty and freedome to Gods Spirit, be come up and known in the earth; for it subjects the one, for the enlargement of the other: Now when the House of God was defiled, the wrath and anger of God was kindled and inflamed against the Inhabitants (the Inhabi∣tants of the Earth,) and the bush burnt and was not consumed (the vi∣sion of which appeared in, and to Moses, that could dwell in the judgment of God, and endure his wrath and anger against what it was then kindled (for the Seeds enlargement;) but Pharoah by whom it was kept in bondage, and whose life stood in the cause and ground thereof, could not endure it, but was consumed and overthrown thereby; yet the perfection of the work of God (at that day) stood afar off the understanding of man: the substance of what did then in bon∣dage or was inbondaged, being in the two Seeds; it being for the sake of his creature (in which his own Seed and Spirit of truth had place) that he suffered the oppressures, and hard burdens, and yoaks that resteth on his Seed, in which Pharaoh magnified himself, untill God saw how to get himself a name in his destruction, that fitted the vessel, for that very end the Lord raised him up (even for the ma∣king known his power in, and on,) for the vessels were in his hand, as is the clay in the hand of the Potter, which he might make for what use he pleased, and according to the pleasure or displeasure of his Spirit (that acted the man that had his own mind and spirit that possessed the vessel,) was the use of the vessel honourable or disho∣nourable, and raised up to the same end his power was made known by, and in, he taking pleasure where his Spirit rested (that as the Sun shined on the bad, as well as good, and as the wind blowed where it listed, and no man knows whence it comes, or whither it shall re∣turn,) that returned from Pharoah finding no rest, whereby the ves∣sel was so fitted (that of necessity) must honour and magnifie the power of the Creator,) that created all things to, and for his own
praise and glory, though it had been implyed in that which was, and is, to the dishonour of his Spirit, that so created it (in reference to its freedom and liberty). And this Gods displeasure, anger and wrath, hath rested and doth rest on several conditions of the creature, which they submitting to, and laying down under, comes to witnesse a change by, and in such conditions: but if they continue in that the anger, wrath, and fury is to, they grow, and come forth creatures filled with fury, wrath and anger, which clouds the glory of the second, and more cleer ad∣ministration of God, even that of love and salvation (that exceeds the first in glory;) and this is a great mistery in the world, to con∣tinue and dwell in the love of God, and know its wound (to wound and destoy that which hath wounded and slew the soul; and so to come forth in the healing and saving Spirit of God, that is the cause and ground of destruction (at the root) to the Devils Kingdom of sin; for nothing can reach the root of sin, and offence to the Spirit of God, but a Judgment well informed by, & in the Spirit of God (faith therein works by the love of) that thereby comes forth in the vi∣ctory of the creatures faith; Therefore let all that read me, come into the love of the Spirit of God, and truth of its discovery in their own hearts, that that may grow (in every particular) which discovers what the sin and offence is to at home, and no longer depend on Judgment without, and set up any mans Judgement and Opinion (in a case of controversie) that one man may Lord it over the Conscience of another, but come out of the controversie, and let he that is Lord only, of, and over the Conscience, take place, and see that true Judg∣ment be set up at home, (within in the heart;) that can only distin∣guish for God (there) and all the rest will soon cease, and the strife about things under a Law without will be ended, and the Covenant felt that puts an end to that without (of works,) and brings in the grace and favour of God, which reacheth to deny all ungodliness and worldly lusts, the everlasting Covenant of righteousness in the heart, and that of the garments and out-side coverings, shall not be the ground of distinction (in Judgement,) that can be but according to the appearance, but the naked and unvailed heart shall be Gods witness, and no self separation will be able to darken this glory, but Power endless is on their head, and Majesty is the garment of their cloathing, that are hid in the storm of the day, and covered from the fury and rage of unreasonable men; praises endlesse to God for this great work.
