¶ By the Queene. WHereas the Queenes Maiestie our most gracious soueraigne Lady, by reason of the plague and pestilence, aswell in the Citie of London, as in the citie of Westminster, and in diuerse other places and parts of this her Maiesties Realme, did lately by her Highnes Proclamation adjourne part of the Tearme of Saint Michael, That is to say, from the vtas thereof, vntill Mensis Michaelis, then to haue begun at the said Citie of Westminster. Neuerthelesse, her Maiestie hauing then perfect vnderstanding that the said plague & pestilence did then increase more and more, did then by her Maiesties Proclamation further adjourne another part of the said Terme of Saint Mi∣chael, that is to say, from Mensis Michaelis aforesaid, vntill the returne of the same Terme, com∣monly called Crastino Martini, then to begin at the said Citie of Westminster, which her Maiestie then did, for that her Highnesse had very great hope that the said sicknes by the fauour of Almigh∣tie God, and by the coldnesse and season of the yeere growing on, and other occasions, by that  would haue ceased. Neuerthelesse, her Highnesse being lately credibly informed, that the said sicknesse continueth, not  at the said Cities of London and Westminster, and is very much there dispersed, but also in diuerse other places with∣  Realme, so that it is to be feared, by the resort of her Maiesties subjects to her said Cities of London and Westmin∣  those that be not infected, may by their comming and tarying there be in great perill and danger of the said plague  that those that come out of the Countries being infected, or from the places where the plague is, may by their comming  accompanying with those that be cleare thereof, put in danger & perill such as they shal accompany here with. And  urstie being also credibly informed, that the certificate which her Highnes receiueth weekely from her said Citie of  is not so sincerely, truely, & wholly certified, as in trueth it should be, but the number of those that die of the plague  then they are, by the corruption and indirect dealing of some inferiour minister, to her Maiesties great offence, e minded, for the better preseruation of her good subjects of all degrees that should repaire to London and West∣ by reason of the Terme, to adjourne at the day of Octabis Martini, which shall bee Tuesday next, the two last Re∣ of the said Terme of Saint Michael: that is to say, the said Octabis and Quindena Martini, vntill the Returne of  Terme next comming, commonly called Octabis Hilarii, then to begin at Westminster, as hath beene accustomed.  her Maiestie signifieth to all and singuler her louing subjects of this her Realme, to the intent that they, and euery  which hath cause or commandement to appeare in any of her Highnes Courts at Westminster, on or at any day or  on on the said Octabis Martini, may tarry at their dwellings, or where their busines otherwise shall lye, without  to any the said Courts for that cause, before the said returne of Hilary Terme, next comming, and that without  of forfeiture, penaltie, or contempt, to incurre towards her Highnes in that behalfe. Neuerthelesse her Maiestie  good and necessarie considerations, for the weale and benefite of her Subjects, is contented and pleased, that  of Castino Martini, vntill the saide Octabis, shal continue & be holden, as if this present Proclamation wer not.  Maiesties further pleasure is, that two or more of her Iustices, that is to say, of either Bench, shal the said Octa∣  adjourne her said two Courts at Westminister, at which day writtes of adiournement shalbe directed to the said  to adjourne the same, in and from the said Octabis Martini, vntill the saide returne of Hilary Terme. And her ties pleasure is, that all matters causes & suites, depending in any of her other Courts, betweene partie and partie,  Highnes Courts of Chancerie, Starre chamber and Exchequer, Courts of wards and Liueries, and Duchie of ancaster shall haue continuance, and the parties shall haue day, at and from the said Octabis Martini, vntill the said re∣ of Hilary Terme. ed alwayes, and her Maiesties pleasure and commandement is, that all Collectors, Receiuers, Sheriffes, and  accomptants, and all other persons that ought or should accompt or pay any summe or summes of money in any of  Maiesties court of Exchequer, courts of wards and Liueries, or of her Duchie of Lancaster, or any them, or that  enter into any accompt in any of the saide courts, shall at their dayes appointed, repaire vnto the accustomed places  minster, where her Highnesse hath appointed such officers and ministers, as for that purpose her Maiestie hath  expedient, and there to pay, and doe in euery behalfe, as though no such Proclamation of adjournement had  or made, any thing mentioned in this Proclamation, or in any writ of adjournement to the contrary, notwith∣ding And her Highnes further pleasure and commandement is, that all Sheriffes shall returne their Writtes and  against all such accomptants and debters at the dayes therein appointed.
