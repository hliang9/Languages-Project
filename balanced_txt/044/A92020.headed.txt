The Ranters Ranting: OR A A true Relation of a sort of People called Ranters, with some of their abominable and wicked car∣riages, and behaviour at their private meetings. J Shall in the first place give you, my friends, a brief Character of a sort of people (whereof you desire satisfaction) newly sprung up among us, called Ranters, alius Coppanits, or Clax∣tonians, tht most vile and abhominable Apostates, that we ever read or heard of, carrying about them the lively image of Satan in his Serpentine colours of seducing and drawing men and women to commitall manner of mad and desperate wickednesse (as the Apostle saith) with greedinesse. I cannot term these persons to be of any Sect, for that I do not learn, either in profession or practise, they do any thing that hath the least stamp or tincture of that which may be rightly called religion. For to rip open, and make known to the world the abominable words and practises of these people, would fill up more paper then I have allotted hereun∣to; and to repeat many things which I am confident might be said without wronging the truth, would make your ears tingle to hear, and my self blush to think or write; yet it is conceived usefull and profitable to many, that some of their deeds of darknesse should be brought forth into the light, to the end, that such as are weak and apt to be drawn aside by every wind of vanity, may be deterred from coming into such company, and with such a one not to eat; for if the Apostle forbids the Centiles (Christians) not to eat with the hea∣thens of that time, surely the same precept extends to the restraining men, that have any spark of goodnesse, from accompanying themselves with such as are
far worse than any heathen or infidels we read of then, or have heard of since; being such as (quite contrary to the rule of St. Paul,) delight not onely in gluttony and drunkennesse, chambering and wantonnesse, and the like, but de∣ride the holy Scriptures, deny Christ, blaspheming, and as it were spit in the face of God himself: for one of them being discoursing at the Spittle said, that he knew not any difference betwixt God and the Divell; and being then asked what he thought of the Divell, he answered that it was an old woman stuffed with parsly: to be short, I am credibly informed, that some of these deny the immortality of the soul, and so holding forth an opinion that there is neither heaven nor hell, it is no wonder that they should fall into all kind of vices, that they commit iniquity by a law. The chief Ringleaders of this viperous genera∣tion, are one Copp and Claxton, of whom I shall say more hereafter, Copp is in Newgate, the other is also a prisoner, this Copp being lately brought be∣fore a Committee to be examined, feigned himself mad, used strange kind of uncouth behaviour, throwing nutshels and other things about the room, and talked to himself when questions were put to him, which some thought to be Gods just judgement upon him, and others were of opinion that (as David in another case) he meerly acted the part which at length will no way stand him in stead. Having given you a general description of them, I shal in the next place come to speak of some of their particular meetings: the first that I have heard of, to be frequented by this brutish sort of people, was about Shoemakers Alley, where after a while, notice was taken, and some discovery made, by such as had been amongst them, rather to observe their vanities, than to be imitaters of their vices, which caused them shortly after to remove to another place. This time of meeting began about four of the clock in the afternoon, and was continued by some until niae or ten of the clock the next day; which time was spent in drun∣kenness, uncleanness, blasphemous words, filthy songs, and mixt dances of men and women stark naked. Not long after, they had another place of meeting about White-Chappel: where after a time they were discovered by the Officers of the place, who with a guard repaired to the house where they were: and to the end that none might make an escape, the business was carried with such secrecie, that it was not known to others till they came to the door, where these monsters of mankind were associated; which the Officers had no sooner entred, but they found some of these lascivious beasts openly satisfying their lusts. Amongst this company was that Claxton, (before mentioned) who with undanted boldness and au∣dacious carriage spake to the Officers, that came with authoritie to apprehend them, to this effect. Gentlemen, I perceive you are come to seize on us, your fellow creatures, for what cause I know not; I pray use not any violence, or terrifie and affright those of our fellow creatures here, that are of a weak and tender constitution:
if we have offended the Law, we shall readily and willingly submit to be tried by it. And taking up his cloak, he said, Gentlemen, I will not leave you, I am ready to go along with you. And sorth he went with the first; and as the o∣thers were comming forth, (about thirty in number) he framed an excuse to return back again into the house, pretending that he had left something of great use behind him, and so escaped away at a back door; but is re-taken, and at this day in prison. I cannot learn, that in any of their meetings, they have used exhortations, except such as tend onely to the making of a derision and scoffe, at all that is commended in the holy and sacred Scriptures to be good and holy; despising the word and ordinances, when they hear them spoken of: and their Ring-leader, Copp (when he was fitter to have gone to bed and slept, than to have spoken in a publick place) bestowed an hours time in belching forth im∣precations, curses, and other such like stuffe, as is not fit to be once named a∣mongst Christirns: and when he perceived that he should be called to answer for the wicked blasphemies that he had uttered, at sundry times, he took two of his she-Disciples, and went to the Citie of Coventrie, where it was soon disper∣sed abroad, that he commonly lay in bed with two women at a time; whereof he being soberly admonished by an Officer of the army, he replied, that it was his libertie, and he might use it; saying further, that unreasonable creatures are not restrained of it. With many other speeches to justifie himself in his ungodly practises, for which he was apprehended and brought up to London, and by the Magistrate committed to Newgate. I shall, in the next place, mention something concerning one or two more of their meetings, and so leave them. Not long since, a select number of men and women met together at a Tavern, where they were accomodated with the choisest wine, and many delicates; of which being plentifully filled, the women withdrew themselves into another room, and disrobed themselves of the apparel in which they were, and clad themselves all in white, (which they call, the Embleme of Innocence;) which no sooner had they done, but there comes in one of the men, and (abusing a text of Scripture) said, Fellow crea∣tures, what shall we do? and soon after, the Master and Drawers of the house perceived and heard such disorderly, and uncivil carriage amongst them, that they were desirous to rid the house of them; which some of the younger sort having notice of, put them all into another kind of passion, and made bold to discover the dissembling faces of some of the female creatures, who let drop some of their hats and black bags to pay the reckoning, and for haste, dropt a paper, which seemeth to be the summons, or invitation of the guests to that meeting, viz. Dear sister and fellow creature, whose sweetnesse we reverence, and whose person we adore, whose witty conceits we admire,
and whose subtilty we wonder at, we do by this our hand-writing, will and require you, our dearest fellow creature, that you personal∣ly appear at the place, where we last had some infernal conference, half an hour past four in the afternoon of this present day; for we have taken notice of the singular, great, and speciall services you have done for inlargement of libertie, since our last actings to∣get her, which we doubt not, will much inlarge our power, and prehe∣minence in drawing disciples to us. Hereof you are commanded not to fail, for that Belzebub, Lucifer, Pluto and above twen∣ty more of the prime officers will attend to give you then and there new documents: and we shall promise, in the word of a King infernal, that you shall raign as a Princesse with us. Signed Diabulo. Dated at our new infernall Pallace without Bishops-gate, 10 of Octob. 1650. There be copies abroad, of several other papers, which some of them have sent abroad in this nature; but this may be sufficient to declare, what a heighth of wickedness they are grown to, who despise the ways of God, and mock and scoffe at his great and glorious name; and as if that were not enough, they now come openly to side, and as it were personate the Divel himself; which makes me the less marvel at some unheard of words and behaviour that were at ano∣ther particular meeting, the sixth day of this present November, at the house of one Middleton, at the sign of David and the Harp, in Moore-lane (whose wife is suspected to be one of them.) To this place a company of them came on the day aforesaid, about five of the clock in the afternoon; but some of the female sex came not, (for at this time the before recited summons was not sent forth:) those that were there first, called for Bread, Beer, and Ale, &c. which was in the house; and as others came in, whether they were men or women, they kist each other, with this expression, welcome fellow creature. And when a competent number of them were gotten together, they began to sing filthy bawdy songs to the tune of Davids Psalms; after which, they drank a health to him, in whom they live, move, and have a being: this being over, one of them lets fall his breeches, and turning his shirt aside, another of the company runs and kisses, saying, they must all do the like, for it was their fellow crea∣ture. This being done, one of the men took a candle, and went up and down the room, as if he had been seeking of a needle; and after a while, one asked him
what he sought after? to whom he answered, That he looks for his sins, but they were not there, he could find none; then they returned again to their tu∣ning of lascivious songs or hymns, in the middest of which, the Constable and other Officers came in, and seized on them all, (except Mrs. Middleton, and one or two more, who made an escape at the back door,) and carried them before a Justice of Peace, who sent six or seven of them to Bridewel; but Mrs. Middle∣ton, and another or two that escaped, are so afraid of receiving punishment an∣swerable to thesr demerits, that they dare not (as yet) remain at their habita∣tions. When those that were taken came before the Justice to be examined, they would confess nothing of their ways, saying, that they would not accuse them∣selves. Whereupon, one that was by, asked, what they meant by the fearful execrations of Ram me, Dam me, &c. one answered, that by the word, Raml they meant God. Many other questions were also asked them, to which they gave none, or a very frivolous, which amounted to little, but to bring them to the place of their first punishment. I shall therefore hasten to decipher their words and be∣haviour in publick, to the end, that if any man chance to fall into their company, they may be known and avoided. And for that this sort of people are dispersed abroad, in the City Country and army, it is necessary that there should be somewhat said to describe them to the end they may be avoided, which by your observation of their words, and actions you may easily do, for although they carry the image and shape of men and women, yet they have the manners onely of a beast. A Description of the Ranters. IF it be a woman, she speaks highly in commendation of those husbands that give liberty to their wives, and will freely; give consent that she should asso∣ciate her self with any other of her fellow creatures, which she shall make choice of; she commends the Organ, Viol, Symbal and Tonges in Charter∣house-Lane to be heavenly musick she tosseth of her glasses freely, and conclu∣deth there is no heaven but the pleasures she injoyeth on earth. she is very familiar at the first sight, and danceth the Canaries at the sound of a horn∣pipe. The men for the most part will thwart you in your discourse, especially if you talk of religion, they can discourse of the Scriptures, and turn them to a wrong sence, if you be talking of death, they say, as a man dieth, so dieth a beast; they believe all things proceed from nature, and that there is no hell but aches and pains incident to man, and want of mony, which hindereth them of taking their fill of pleasure: and though they hold it convenient to have one woman to dwell constantly with one man, to do his necessary businesse, yet
are they of opinion that they may have carnall knowledge of any, and as ma∣ny other women as their beastly desire can make use of. And in this kind of coupling together (or making a conjunction copulative) the woman doth commonly make choice of the man she will dwell with; and as they slight and contemn all ordinances, so do they that of marriage, yet have they a kind of ceremony to be used for it, concerning which, I shall give you one familiar and merry instance, and so leave them. A sober man of good fashion, chanced to go to a place, where a Com∣pany of them were gathered together at a Conference, onely with a purpose to observe what was said and done; and at the time of their breaking up, or di∣solving that meeting, there comes to this man a young woman, and tells him, that she was single, or free to dispose of her self as she pleased, and that she had a liking unto him her fellow Creature, whom she could willingly love and serve, in the neerest relation that a womhn could be to a man: which at the first much startled the party, and after the returne of a Complement, he thought it worth his time, to see a little further concerning the temper, and disposition of this bold Creature, so desired her to take part of a pint of Sack, over which they might with the more conveniency inlarge their discourse; which she readily accepted, and to the Taverne they went, and no sooner was the wine brought up, but she calls for a Roll of bread, and holding it forth to the party that was with her said: fellow Creature, break this with me, which he did; when you have eaten that part in your hand, and I likewise this, we are in condition or acceptation of man and wife: then after some fur∣ther discourse (be knowing well that he had a wife at home of a gallant spi∣rit, and a lover of virtue) directed her home to his house, where he told her she should find a maid would give her entertainment, while he spake a few words with a Gent. with whom he had earnest businesse; whereupon she went to the house, and asked for the master of the house, and being told he was nor within, she said that she would stay his comming, and having some discourse with the maid servant, and perceiving the house well furnished, she could no longer hold, but tels the maid she was her mistresse, and all there was hers; which story the maid hasted to tell her mistresse, with whom she had lived many years; who immediately came with a good Broom-staff, and did so belabour the Gent. that she went away in a worse case then if she had beat∣en hemp a moneth in Bridewel, a just reward for her bold impudencie, and I pray God that such as heare this relation, and the wickedness of their ways, may be preserved from following them in the same excess of ryot, that every one may keep a watch over his own ways, for some of these of which I have spoken, have been thought consciencious persons, and had attained to a great measure of knowledge in the ways of God, and if these fall away, let him that standeth take heed least he fall. FINIS.
