THE SPEECH OF PATRICK Earl of Marchmont, &c. His Majesties high Commissioner to the PARLIAMENT OF SCOTLAND. On Munday the 22 of August 1698. My Lords and Gentlemen, YOU may remember, that his Majesty in his gracious Letter to you, takes Notice, that the Fonds given in the former Sessions have fallen short of what was expected, which has occasioned Arrears to be due to the Forces lately disbanded; And that there is also a Debt upon the account of the Frigots, and that the Forts and Garison'd Places need Repa∣ration: Therefore His Majesty recommends to you to provide what may be sufficient for these Ends. You have heard the Overture has been made of a Pole, to be imposed for the use of the disbanded Forces, and I hope you will proceed to the Conside∣ration of it. As for the maintaining of the Frigots, His Majesty thinks, that the conti∣nuing the Imposition of Tunnage upon ships will be one proper Fond for that purpose. And I am commanded to represent to you, that the safety of the Kingdom doth require, that the Forts and Garison'd places, particularly, that of Fort William be sufficiently repaired, and that it is necessarie the Magazines be well furnished with Arms and Ammunition. I have good Reason to be perswaded, that you will provide effectually for these needfull Purposes; And that as you hitherto have done, you will still continue, to do what will be much to His Majesties Satisfaction, and will greatly tend to the safety of this Kingdom, and to your own Honour and Reputation: Then will your Actings witness to the World, that you are alwise thankfully mindfull of the happy Deliverance you have had from the Dangers to which your Religion and Liberties were formerly exposed. Edinburgh, Printed by the Heirs and Successors of Andrew Anderson, Printer to the King's most Excellent Majesty, Anno Dom. 1698.
