¶Philip Moore to the gentill reader. I Haue (gentill reader) sette foorthe this smalle treatice, whiche I haue intiteled the hope of Health: because my chief intēt in makyng thereof, was to exhort both men and women (to preserue their heal∣thes) and to bestow soche labour in ma∣kyng of Gardaines, and in plantyng of sundrie herbes, that their Gardaines might be to them and theirs, in stede of a poticaries shop: wherin thei maie find soche medicines, as are prescribed to theim by the Phisicion, without any great cost, and to their singulare profite. in this treatise you shall finde: Firste, what thynges are necessarie to be kno∣wen, for the preseruacion and maintei∣naunce
of health. Secōdarily, what thin¦ges are to be obserued, cōcernyng thyne ordinarie diete, in sundrie meates to a∣noide sicknes. Thirdlie, thuse of a Gar∣dein, and the natures of sundrie herbes. Fowerthlie, the declaracion of sickenes and the commodities of medicines. Last of all, you shall finde certain rules of A∣stronomy, wherof the most part are an∣nexed vnto Phisicke: which simple la∣bours of mine, if you will vouchsafe wil¦lingly to accept, you shal encourage me, to bestow greater paines, for thinstruc∣cion and cōmoditie of the good readers, as farre forth as my smal learning will extende. Thus fare you wel. Frō Hal∣lesworth in Suff. The first of Maie. Anno salutis. M.D.lxiiij.
¶TO THE RIGHT VVOR∣shipfull sir Owen Hopton knight: Philip Moore wisheth eternall felicitee. WHen I consider with my self (right wor∣shipfull sir) the great nomber of externall benefites, whiche it hath pleased almigh∣tie God, of his infi∣nite mercie and goodnes, to bestowe vp∣pon all mankinde: Although I am cer∣tainlie perswaded, that no man is able to thanke and praise hym, for the least of theim sufficientlie, yet I doe thinke ne∣uerthelesse, that eche man hath cause to geue thankes to God, more for his helth then he hath for any other worldlie pro∣mocion or benefite: as riches, possessiōs, honor, dignitie, and soche like. For with out worldly wealth, a healthfull manne maie liue in that vocacion,Wealth with¦out health is nothyng. wherin God hath called him, with pleasure and good companie: But to a man whiche is ex∣treme
sicke, riches be noysome, possessi∣ons superfluous, honour neclected, di∣gnitie despised, pleasures bee lothsome, and companie is comberous, thereby al∣so strength and pleasure bee altred into imbecillitie and weakenes.Paine hathe no pleasure. And laste of the liuelie ruddie colour and beautie of the face, is conuerted into deadlie pale∣nesse, and deformitie. Since therefore, health is soche a precious iewell to mā∣kinde, that without it, all worldlie plea∣sures are painfull. I thinke it meete and expedient for eche manne, that hath any regarde to hymself, to learne the know∣lege of the constitucion of his bodie, and to obserue a meane in his diet, and other necessarie thinges concerning his health that thereby he maie escape dauugerous diseases, and preserue his bodie longe in good state, or at the least he maie signifie to the Phisicion a greate deale the bet∣ter, the occasion of his sicknes by due ob∣seruacions: so maie conueniente medici∣nes bee moche soner ministred, whereby health will quicklie be recouered again. In consideracion wherof I am perswa∣ded,
that all menne that bee of good iudgemente and vnderstandyng, dooe thinke theim worthie of greate praise, and of immortall praise, whiche haue by continuall studie, longe trauaille, and good experience founde out and lefte be∣hinde theim to vs their posteritie, soche an arte and science, as is hable to en∣structe a manne, not onelie to heale and cure, a great nomber of greuous di∣seases (whereunto eche mannes bodie, is dailie subiect.) But also it teacheth, to preserue & kepe the same bodie in health, so long as the course of nature will suf∣fer á man to liue. These be the effectes, whiche the moste excellente arte of Phi∣sicke, can certainlie performe, to as ma∣ny as wil diligently obserue the precep∣tes and doctrine thereof, whiche noble science, as holie scripture doeth testifie, was not a fonde inuencion of coueteous heddes for lucres sake, but is certainlie the necessarie gift of God,Donū dei. by hym ordai∣ned, and sente emong mortall menne, to the ende that by the helpe thereof, thei might the longer sustaine, and preserue
their fraile bodies in health, preuenting sickenes that would ensue, and curyng that whiche is presente, whiche thinges are euidentlie declared, in diuerse places of the Bible, but moste plainlie in the .38▪ chapiter of Ecclesiast. where it is writtē after this sorte. Affice medicum suis ho∣noribus & premijs, vt necessitate vrgen∣te eo vti possis nam eum creauit domi∣nus▪ Est enim a supremo medicina, & a re¦gestipendium accipiet. Dn̄s ex terra cō∣didit medicamenta, & prudens homo nō contemnit ea, cede locum medico, domi∣nus enim illum creauit. That is to saie, giue vnto the Phisicion due honour and rewards, that thou maiest haue his help in time of nede, for the Lorde hath ordai∣ned him.The greatest Minister of God mong men, next the deuine▪ to the Phisiion. Trulie Phisick is of the highest and it shall receiue a stipēde of the king. The Lorde hath made medicines on the yearth: and a wise man will not contēne them. Geue place vnto the Phisicion, for the lorde hath ordained him. By whiche wordes it is euident, that Phisike is or∣dained of God, for the profite and com∣moditie of all mākind, whiche although
perchaunce it hath been, and is abused, ought neuer the more to bee hated or dis∣pised. For, there is no science nor know∣lege in the worlde, so perfecte and good, but that it hath been of euill persones a∣bused: As it is euident, the holie scriptu∣res beeyng Gods eternall veriti, haue sondrie tymes heretofore, been abused of many sortes of detestable heretiques, as of Arrians, Anabaptistes, and the dam∣nable,A secr called the Boneri∣tes, or Reno∣bites. vile, Romishe Papistes, the Dar∣bellites, the Garnarites, the Bonerites &c. which wrieth & wresteth the scriptu∣res, to their erronious and Deuilishe o∣pinions, deceiuyng the ignoraunte peo∣ple, & bringing them to vtter distrucciō. In so moche therefore as Phisike is so highlie commended to vs in his holie scripture, as a speciall gifte of God, and also it is knowen to be, by daielie expe∣rience, moste commodious, profitable, and necessarie for all kinde of persones, beyng indued with vnderstandyng, not beyng ignorant al together in soch pre∣ceptes thereof, as doe necessarily pertain to the preseruaciō of his health. So that
eche man should so farre forthe beholde his owne bodie, that he might by diligēt obseruacion, knowe when he were in healthe, and what diet he ought chieflie to obserue, for to preserue thesame in health and good state, whiche thyng if it were well obserued, would redounde moste certainly, to the greate commodi∣tie of an infinite noumber of people, de∣fendyng them from diuers paines and diseases, into the whiche, many tho∣rowe their owne ignoraunce and necli∣gence, dooe often tymes fall. And there∣fore, I thought it verie good, to wishe all menne, to seeke the knowledge of soche thynges, as concerne healthe. For which cause (right worshipful sir) I haue endeuoired my self (as moche as in me lieth) to declare and comprehende in this small treatise, soche rules of Phisicke as are profitable to bee knowen and obser∣ued, of all soche as bee desirous to pre∣serue their bodies in healthe. Not arro∣gantlie presumyng hereby, to enstructe the learned and skilfull: but beyng mo∣ued with good will and naturall affec∣cion,
to the readers hereof, accordyng to my simple knowledge, I purpose by this my smalle trauaille, to declare vnto the willyng minded, good rules of Phisike, wherein the hope of health doe consiste.Hope of Health. And also to prescribe vnto them, the vse and commodities of a good Gardaine, with the names, natures, and vertues of diuers herbes, whiche are very requisite for meates and medicines. Beyng part∣lie prouoked therunto, by that whiche I haue perceiued in your owne self, that neither good will hath béen wāting, nor coste spared, to make a pleasant ground, furnished with many holsome and swete herbes and flowers, as at this presente tyme appereth, at your aunciēt Mansion called Cockfeld halle, whiche example I would wishe many gētlemē should imi∣tate. But chiefly again I was moued, to write somwhat of a gardein and herbes, because the greatest part of curing of di∣seases by medicines, doeth cōsiste in her∣bes, whiche ye vulgare people ar so igno∣raunt in, that thei neither knowe them, nor yet dooe endeuoire theim selues to
haue any store of them in their Gardai∣nes, whiche is greatlie to their discom∣moditie. Truely these causes moued me after that I had declared, what thynges were mete to be knowen and obserued, for presecuaciō of health, to speake som∣what of the commodities of a Gardain, that is well furnished with sundrie her∣bes: declaryng also the names, natures, and vertues, of soche herbes as be moste common in this region of Englande, to thentente I might prouoke the common people, to haue herbes in better estima∣cion, and to learne to knowe theim, to plant them, and sowe them in their gar∣daines, cherishyng theim as thynges, whereby thei maie obtaine remeadie of painfull diseases, by the coūsaill of a dis∣crete Phisicion, without any great coste or trauail. To this ende I haue declared vnto your worship, my purpose and in∣tente, in publishyng this small treatise, whiche I dooe dedicate vnto you, as an assured token of my duetie, & good harte towardes your worship, beyng thereto prouoked, by the singulare benefites, re∣ceiued
at your hādes. For whiche bene∣fites (accordyng to my habilitie) in steede of a recōpence, I signifie vnto your wor∣ship, by this simple gifte, that I am not vnmindfull of my duetie. Wherefore I desire you (right worshipfull sir) to ac∣cepte this my simple trauaile, beyng the fruites of that small talent, whiche God hath vouchesaued to lende me, in good parte. Thus wishyng vnto your wor∣ship, and to my good Ladie your bedfel∣lowe, long continuaunce of perfecte healthe, with increase of moche worship: I commit you to the tuicion of the al∣mightie God, whose hande alwaies preserue you and yours. AMEN. Your maisterships muste humble to commande. Philip Moore.

IN this former Kalender, what daie of any monethe you doe chose, you shall straight finde in the first rowe toward the lefte hande, in what signe, and in what degree the Sonne is in. In the seconde rowe you shall finde what hower, and what minute the Sonne setteth. In the fowerth row is declared the lengthe of the daie, betwene Sonne and Sonne, in howers and minutes. In the fifte rowe is set forthe the length of the night, from Sonne sette, to Sonne rise. In the sixte rowe is the noumber of daies of the mo∣neth. And in the seuenth rowe is the golden noumber. Laste of all is the dominicall letter, and the sainctes daies. As for example. If you looke the seconde daie of Aprill, straighte you shal finde in the first rowe, that the Sonne is in the .22. degree of Aries. The Sonne riseth. 16. minutes after .5. of the clocke, and setteth .44. minutes after .6. of the clocke, the daie is .13. howers and .35. minutes in lengthe: and the night is .10 . howers and .35. minutes long, and so maie you finde in like sorte for any daie, throughout the whole yere. Note, when I speake of minutes, that there bee in an hower .60. minutes: and so .45. mi∣nutes
bee three quarters of an hower, and .30. minutes bee halfe an hower, and .15. make a quarter of an hower. So that when I saied be∣fore, yt the second day of Aprill, the Sonne ri∣seth .16. minutes after .5. of the clocke, I meane it riseth one quarter of an hower and a minute after .5. And so vnderstande likewise of all mi∣nutes. Note, that there bee .12. signes in the Zodiacke of the heauens, and euery signe is deuided into .30. degrees: so that a degrée is the 30. parte of a signe. The names and Charectes of the .12. signes are these ♈ Aries, ♉ Taurus, ♊ Gemini, ♋ Cancer, ♌ Leo, ♍ Virgo, ♎ Libra, ♏ Scorpio ♐ Sagittarius, ♑ Capricornus, ♒ Aquarius, ♓ Pisces. These thynges I haue thought good to be added in the ende of the Kalender, for the better instruccion of them that bee ignoraunt, leste if thei should doubt in any parte of it, thei were not able of theim selues, to finde out the knowledge thereof. I was fullie determined, when I began this small treatise, to haue ad∣ded vnto it, diuerse necessarie rules of Astro∣nomie, concernyng the mocions of the heauēs, and of the planettes, and certaine fixed starres that the reby men that trauaile, either by lande
or by sea, might knowe the partes of ye heauens and iudge certainlie the true hower of all sea∣sons, aswell by night as by daie. But because I did consider, that these thynges did nothyng appertaine vnto these matters, y• I haue made mencion of in the premisses. And also because conuenient leisure was wanting, I thought it better to differre myne endeuor at this present entending God willyng, to publishe it with o∣ther necessary preceptes of like sort, perteining to Cosmographie, and the Mathematicall sciē∣ces, as sone as cōuenient tyme shalbe ministe∣red vnto me: if so bee I maie perceiue this my simple labour to be thanckfullie accepted. ¶Certaine fautes esca∣ped in printyng.

¶The firste booke teacheth diuers preceptes, verie necessarie to be knowen, of soche as are studious to preserue the bodie in health. ¶The .i. Chapiter. ¶Of the constitucion and ori∣ginall of mannes bodie. MOses the moste faithefull seruaunt of the high God, beeyng enspired with the holy ghost, and writing of the beginning of the world dooeth euidentlie declare in the booke, whiche is called Genesis.Genesis. i. That almigh∣tie God by his omnipotencie (after that he had made all other liuyng creatures in the world) he created Adam and Eue our first parentes, blesyng them and sai∣yng, encrease, and multiplie, and reple∣nishe the yearth: whiche blessyng (al∣though after it, through their transgres∣sion, thei were driuen out of the plea∣saunt Paradise, and cast forthe into this vale of miserie, the yearth, them selues,
and their posteritée, being cursed for their offence) yet it tooke soche effecte that all mankinde, whiche haue been since that tyme, vntill this daie, haue proceded of them and their posteritee, beyng ingen∣dred by the coniunction of their parētes. Soche was the wonderfull prouidence of God omnipotent,Generatis vius est corruptio al∣terius. Aristo. de generatione. from the beginning that all liuing creatures, should contain in theim selues soche seede, as doeth suf∣fice to engender their like in their kinde, that thereby the frailtee and mortalitee of eche kinde of liuyng creates, might by succession bee preserued from vtter de∣caie, and remain from age to age: conti∣nually increasing by many hundred ye∣res, to the settyng for the of Goddes glo∣rie, whiche thyng as dooeth plainlie ap∣pere in euery kind of creature: so it maie sufficiently and moste manifestly be per∣ceiued,Deus bene vidit presentia & futura. by consideryng the state of man∣kind. Whose life, although for the moste part after Noes lood, it hath not excea∣ded an hundred yeares in one particular man, yet none can denie but at this day,
(beyng aboue fiue thousande yeares frō the beginning of the worlde) the nom∣ber of men is so infinite proceaded of the two former persones our first parentes,The cause of generacion af¦ter the Diui∣nes and Phi∣sicions. that they be as the fane of the sea, or as the starres of the heauen, innumecrable. The body therefore of eche mankynde, (the twoo former persones onely excep∣ted) is ingēdred of the sead of his parētes in his mothers wombe eche parte of the body, being their fourmed and fashioned by diuine nature, receiuing no norishe∣ment of bloud vntill ye full time of birth. But after that the infant is borne into the worlde, as long as it is tender And weake, it is fedde and nourished with milke, and when strengthe is increased then meates are ministred to it of sondry substaunce, est corporibus puerorum. Aristo. de cono∣micorum. & harder of digestion. Wher¦in if a due order and moderate measure be kept, and certain other necessary cir∣cumstaunces obserued, which both rea∣son and arte prescribeth as shalbe here∣after declared, then the bodie continueth alwayes vnto the last age in safetie, and
health, moreouer eche member kepeth his naturall estate, and is both able and readie to doe soche functiōs and busines as nature hath ordained them to doe. As the stomack to haue a good appetite,ale. de vs artium. lib. vi. and to digest and alter meates well, the ly∣uer to engender good bloud, the raynes to seperate vrine from the bloud, & soche like, excepting alwayes some externall and violent outward cause, whiche may hinder their operation, as a wynde, a fal, or soche like, of whiche I entende not to speake further in this place. ¶The .ii. Chapter. ¶what thinges be requisite for him to knowe whiche would kepe his body in health. THe preseruatiō of health doth chiefly consiste in knowledge of the body, and in due & mo∣derate vse of sustinaunce mi∣nistred to thesame. Of the first part I will chiefly intreate in this booke. First it is requisite to come to ye know¦ledge of our bodies, by vnderstanding
wherof they are compacte and made. Secondarily,Fiue good notes to be marked. it is good and nedefull to knowe the differences of the partes of the bodie. Thirdly, their offices and powers, are to be considered. Fourthly, the diuersitie of humains. Last of all, the complexions of the bo∣dies, are to be diligently marked: which thinges duely and exactely considered & noted. A mete diet may sone bée serched out, whiche if it be obserued there is no doubte, but helthe may be preserued and sicknes eschued so long as nature is able to sustaine the body,Folowe the example of a true Phisiciā which thing Galen the Prince of all Phisitions declared in him self, who although by nature he had a weake body which was subiect to ma∣ny diseases in his youth, yet he cōfesseth him selfe, that after eightene yeares of age being thē somewhat skilful in phi∣sicke, he so preserued his body, that from those yeares vntill the time of his death, which many reporte to be about the hū∣dred yere of his age, he was neuer vexed
with any sicknes, except it were with a seuer called Ephemera,Ephemera est fe∣bris ex repletio∣ne. &c. whiche lasteth but one daye, & that also he could easely haue auoyded, if he had not more regar∣ded at sometime to pleasure his frende with his arte, then to obserue in al poin∣tes the exacte preseruation of his health. But peraduenture some wil alledge for this one example, whiche is by hearsaye that they haue seen and dooe knowe di∣uerse Phisitions whiche be often subiect to sundrie diseases, as wel as other sorts of men. And therfore, this litle perswa∣deth them that any arte maye preserue a man lōg in health:Twoo Phi∣icions, the irst for pro∣ite, the secōd or pleasure. to whom I answer that there is great difference betwene those that study phisicke only to get a li∣uing thereby, and them that searche out the knowlege therof to guide their liues according to the doctrine of it. Of this last sorte of Phisitions was Galen, who thought it a great reproche bothe to the science and to himselfe, if this prouerbe might truly haue béen verified of him. Aliorum est medicus ipse vlceribus sta∣tens,
that is to saye: he is Phisition to other himself being full of byles & sores. Of thesame sorte also, many other fa∣mous Phisitions haue béen, and at this present be,Medicus  te ipsum. whiche men of indifferent & vpright iudgement doe and may easelye perceiue. But of the first sorte, if there haue ben any, or by chaunce at this pre∣sent be, I thinke they are an example to discredite this noble sciēce, only to those that be ignoraunt, rude and vnlearned, who for that cause are enemies of this arte. And therfore it is a true prouerbe, Scientia non habet inimicum nisi igno∣rantem, that is: none is enemy to anye knowledge or science, but he that is ig∣noraunt in it: if any that bee vnlearned, doe take occasion to despise phisike as a vaine thing, takyng example at the life of the first sorte of phisitiōs aforenamed,Stomblers at strawes, despisers of vertue. I thinke I may safely iudge that they do it of an obstinate stubburnes, or of a can∣cred hatred, or els of wilfull blindnes, like as the vile Renobites and Papistes at this presēt daie, do seke meanes to dis∣credite
credite preachers as muche as they can, by scrupulous serching and examininge of their liuing, which somtime they finde to disagree from their doctrine. God geue them grace to repente in time, that they laye no soche stumbling blockes in wei∣klinges wayes. Nowe I will leaue thē, and returne againe to my purpose, de∣claring in order the thinges requisite to be vnderstanded, for the knowledge of our bodies, as is aforesaied. ¶The. iii. Chapiter. ❧wherof mans body is compacte. FIrst it is to be noted that ther are foure Elementes,Elememta inquet Auicenna sunt corpora simplicia &, sunt partes prime corporis humane & ale∣orum. &c. that is; fyre, ayre, water, and earthe, which elementes haue in thē contrarie qualities one to an other, that is, heate, colde, drienes, and moisture. And the yearth is the loweste and hea∣uiest element, and it is colde and drie by nature: Next the earth is the water, be∣yng colde and moist. The aire is aboue the water, and is hote and moiste. Then
cometh in the fire, whiche is the highest & the lightest element, being hote & drie. Of these foure elementes (according to the sentence of Hipocrates, & Galene, and all other phisitions of that secte) na∣ture hath framed and made eche mans bodie. So that euery mans body is com∣pact and doth consiste of the foure Ele∣mentes whiche are so mixed together by nature,De temperamen∣tis humani cor∣poris ex Galen that none of them doth remaine simple and pure in mannes body. And therefore we oughte not to thinke that pure fyre or water, ayre or earth, should be conteined in mans body, if that he bée made thereof, because the elementes are not vnmixed in any liuing creature, but like as in a medicine made of waxe, pitch rosyn and tallowe, when thei are melted together, there appeareth neither ware, nor pitche,Example of complexions. nor rosyn, nor yet tallowe, but a thing cōpounded of their substaūce whiche retaineth their qualities and yet is like none of them. Euen so in mans body whiche consisteth of the foure ele∣mentes being cōmixed by nature in his
generation, none of the elementes is to be séen or perceiued simplie and seperat∣ly, but there appereth euidently a sub∣staunce commixed and made of the ele∣mentes, whiche substaunce retaineth in it the qualities of theim, and yet is like none of thē.Our sences must be satis∣fied in mat∣ters of reaon It shal be sufficient therfore (for him that is not so muche addicte to his senses) that he will beleue nothyng but that whiche he ma see, féele, or per∣ceine, with outwarde senses: When he seeth in the body any mēber that is colde and drie, and harde as bones, gristles, or suche like, he maye consider that the substaunce of yearth is there, where he findeth his qualities, as likewise when he seeth bloud moiste and liquid, he may perceiue that ye element of water is ther. The great heate that is in a liuing body may put him in minde of the element of fyre:Elementa non mnet n mixto allu sd in vire . Aristo. lib. de generatione. Like as also the breath of man may sone persuade him yt the element of ayre is in mans body. This example I haue brought furth only to cause a deper con∣sideration of the coniunctiō of the foure
elemētes in man  which although it can not be iudged by outward senses, yet is it certainly to be credited that eue∣ry member in mans body be it neuer so smal, doth consiste of the foure elemētes. And therfore the aunciēt Phisitions de∣fineth an element, saiyng it to be the lest and moste simple portion of that thinge which it doth constitute and make. The cause why the knowledge of ye elemētes is both mete and necessary, as well for him that is studious to preserue helth, as for the Phisition is, that eche of thē may vnderstande that health doth consiste in a naturall temperature of heate,De elementorum naturis. ex Aui∣na. &c. colde, drynes, and moisture. And contrariwyse that disease chaunce to the body by dis∣tempure of the said foure qualities of the elemētes, for nature hath geuē to euery member of the body in the time of gene∣ration a moste mete & apt temperature∣from whiche if any member doe decline in heate, colde, drynes or moisture, there followeth some disease in that member whiche is consequent to the qualitie a∣bounding
or waunti. ¶The. iiii. Chapiter. ❧Of the difference of partes in mans bodie. THough the partes of mās body be mani in nombre, yet thei at comprehended in a fewe diui∣sions. Note therfore that there be some partes of the body that be called in Latine (Simdares partes,) that is to sate, soche partes as being deuided, eche pece is like the whole parte, & may well be called by the same denomination and name:Doctor Lāg ton haue no∣ted this from Leonardus Fut∣hius in a good Methode. As for example, the least peace of fleshe is to be called fleshe, as the whole member from whiche it was seperate. And these following be commonly cal∣led Similari or like partes, that is, fleshe, bones, sinues, gristles, filmes, ligamēts, vaines, arteries and suche like. Some other partes in the body be called in La∣tine Instrumentales or dissimilares par∣tes, that is, instrumentalles and vnlyke partes, and sche members are compoū∣ded and doe consiste of the saied similarie
and like partes: As the head, the hande, the foote, and such other members, that are compact of bones, sinues, flesh, vay∣nes, & other aforenamed. Note also that of instrumentall members there be two sortes:Cor est principi sensus & motus in animali. Aris. de somo & ∣gilia. whereof they that bee of the firste sorte be called principall members. And they are foure in nombre (that is to saye) the brayne, the harte, the liuer, and the stones. And these are called principal mē¦bers, because without the three first, no man may liue. And without the last, the generatiō of mankinde should cease▪ All other instrumentarie members besides these foure, are lesse principall, and are to be coumpted of the second sorte Note moreouer that to y• aforesaid foure prin∣cipall members, there he foure ministers or hādmaydes, that is, senues, arteries, vaines, and sparmatike vessels, whereof senues serueth for the brayne,Arteriarum as∣cendentium de∣scendentiumqu series. ex Galen libro de dissecti∣one arterri Cap. ix. Arteries for the harte, vaynes serue for the lyuer, and sparmatike vessels for the stones. Thus muche haue I spoken for the ge∣nerall difference of members in mans
body: As for the knowledge of special, or particular differences of eche parte of e∣uery member, I referre the Reader to bookes of Anatomies. ¶The. v. Chapiter. ❧Of the offices and powers of mem∣bers in mans body. THe facultie vertue or power y• nature hath graffed in any mē¦ber,Facultates ani∣mal gubnantes res  inter s genis habns  quarum alia dicitur animalis vitalis, naturalis. is the cause from whence the action, doing, or working▪ of that member procedeth & springeth. It behoueth vs therefore firste to serche out what faculties there be in the body, that thereby the operations of members may appeare. Note that there be three diuerse faculties or powers whiche doe gouerne the whole body of mā. And they be called in Latin Animalis facultas, vi∣talis, & naturalis, that is, the animal po∣wer, the vitall, and the naturall power. And these three faculties be engraffed & doe proceade from the thre first principal members, that we haue made me
of in the former chapiter, (that is) from the braine,Animalis in  trimlis erebri continetu Gle de methodo me∣dendo. lib. ii. the harte, and the liuer, from whiche members all other partes of the body receiue their force and vertue. For in the braine consisteth the facultie and power animall, whiche is deriued & sent from thēse by synowes that syring there into al partes of the bodie, guing sense and mouing throughout the bodie, and increasing wit. And therfore it is to bee noted that there be three sundrie actions or operations, that proceade from this facultie, into diuerse partes of the body. The first action whereof the power ani∣mall is cause,Alus prim &c  corpore hmani is outward sense, and that is done  maner of wayes, that to, by seing, hearing, smelling, tasting and fe∣ling. The second action is volūtarie mo∣uing of any mēber, wherby a man may moue any member of his body when he will, and state it at his pleasure, as the mouing of the legge, the arme, the head the tounge and suche like. The thirde ac¦tion is inwarde sense, and wit, or vnder¦standing, and it is called in Latine Prin∣ceps,
It may be called in Englishe prin∣cipall or chief.Partlum interios um capitis ex aleno. And there be three kindes thereof, that is imagination or common sense, reason or fantasie: And memorie wherof (according to Philosophers opi∣nions) the imagination consisteth in the formoste parte of the brayne ouer the forehead, and fantasie remaineth in the midle of the braine. Last of all, memorie is placed in the hindermost parte of the braine aboue the noddle of the necke. The seconde facultie or power,De facultatibus humani in corde  Galeno. which is called the vitall facultie, doth consiste in the harte, whiche is the fountaine of life and natural heate, and it spreadeth from thence in arteries or pulses, that haue their first beginning ther, into al partes of the bodie, geuing life to the whole bo∣die, wherfore the chiefe action and ope∣ration of this facultie proceading, is the geuing of vitall and liuely breath to all members, whiche thing is perfourmed by the pulses, cōtinually opening or ry∣sing vp, and shutting or falling downe, whiche when they open they drawe into
themseues cold ayer, whiche ayer dothe recreate, there vp, & refreshe the power vitall, whereof also the power animall is engendred. But when the pulses or Arteries shutte,Partium humani corporis. they expl and driue out soche fumous and smoky excrementes as are engendred through burninge or boiling of humours in the whole bodie,Alie Calide. Frigide. Humide, Siccae. Ve Spiritus. Cor. Sanguinis. Ietur. for naturall heate is not vnlike to a fire, whiche in boyling of any liquor raiseth a great fume, euen so whē natural heate will turne the substaunce of meates, re∣ceiued into the substaunce of the mem∣bers of our body, it first boileth them and trieth them, taking so moche of them as is moste apte and mete. And the reste is expelled out of the bodie; and is called an excrement. The thirde and last facultie or power that gouerneth the bodie, is called the naturall facultie, which consisteth in the lyuer, and it is sent from thence into all members of the bodie, in vaines whiche dooe theire beginne and spring, mini∣string nourishement and foode to eche
member. And note, that this facultie is the cause of foure sundrie operations, whiche it geueth to eche member, & that is attraction, retention, digestion, and ex¦pulsion, whose vertues are as foloweth. First by the power attractiue euery mē∣ber dothe drawe vnto it soche Iuise and foode as is metest to nourishe it.Of the fower naturall ver∣tues. Secon∣darely, by the power retentiue, eche mē∣ber is able to keepe still and retaine the iuyse that is drawen to it vntill it be al∣tered and chaunged into the substaunce of the member that it should nourishe, & these two faculties are ministers, or hād∣maides to the altring or disgesting facul¦tie. Thirdly, by the digestiue or altering power, that iuyse whiche is drawen to any member and retained there, is dige∣sted, altered, and chaunged into another substaunce, and by thesame power also it is aglutinate and ioyned to the mem∣ber whiche is to be nourished. And last of all, it is made like to yt member which it nourisheth▪ Fourthly, by the expulsiue power eche member is able to seperate,
expulse, and driue from it al suche super∣fluitées as be vnprofitable, to nourishe that member and soche as nature is not able to alter and digeste, soche superflui∣ties and excrementes eche member hath power by the expulsiue facultée to driue from it, lest if they should tarie long in any part of the body, they would putri∣fie and rotte. These be the principal po∣wers and operations whiche I alreadie haue rehersed.Hyporates . But beside them other mē¦bers that are lesse principall, haue their peculier operations: as the longes dra∣weth in, and sendeth fourth breath, the stomacke desireth meates and drinkes. The liuer draweth the iuye of meates & drinkes out of the stomacke, & the guttes and turneth it into bloude, the gail dra∣weth colerique humours frō the bloude, the splene draweth melancholie humors from the bloud: The raines drawe and seperate vrine from the bloud,Reni eicae. and sen∣deth it downe into the bladder. And di∣uerse other members haue peculier ope∣rations, whiche would be to long to re∣herse
in this small treatise. ¶The .vi. Chapiter ¶Of the diuersitee of humours in mannes bodie. THere bee in the bodie of all man∣kinde;De humoribus aliter ex Galeno & alils. fower sondrie humours, that is, blood, fleume, choler, and melancholie: whiche humours are daie∣lie nourished and engendred, of the iuise of meates and drinkes, receiued into the body, and there altered by naturall heat. These humours,Sanguis. Vituita. Bilis. Flaua. Atra bilis. maie bee called the se∣cond elementes, or the elementes of mā, for thei are equalle with the elementes, and thei haue also the qualities of Ele∣mentes. For blood is hotte and moiste, like the aire, fleume is colde and moiste, like the water: Choler is hotte and drie, like the fire, and Melancholie is cold and drie, like the yearth. These .4. humours, as long as the bodie is in health, doe re∣maine in soche porcion, as nature ordai∣ned theim in, at the firste generacion of the bodie: and thei keepe their appointed places, their colours, tastes, and opera∣tions,
for whiche nature ordeined them. Knowe therefore,Sanguinis vsus. &c. that blood is engē∣dred in the Liuer, of the iuise that is dra∣wen out of the stomacke, and is more a∣boundaunte in a haile man, then any of the humours beside: it is spread from the Liuer by vaines, into al partes of the bo∣die, his vse and propertie is to nourishe eche member. And if the blood he natu∣rall, it is hote and moiste, or rather tem∣perate: it is red in colour, and sweete in taste, whiche plainly appereth in health∣full folke. Fleume that is naturalle, is lesse in quantitie then blood, it is chiefly engen∣dred in the stomacke, and it is as it were nourishemente halfe digested, or halfe tourned into bloode, whiche beyng dra∣wen with the iuise of meates and drin∣kes to the Liuer, the greateste parte of it tourneth into bloode. The vse and pro∣pertie of the rest of flegme, is to make the blood to flowe more quicklie in the vai∣nes: and flegme also, because it is liquid and slipperie, it helpeth the mouyng of y•
ioyntes. And note, that naturall flegme is cold and moiste in operacion, white in coloure, and without taste like water. Choler that is natural, is lesse in qua∣litie then Flegme. And note, that na∣ture hath appoincted for it, a peculiar re∣ceptale and seate, that is a bladder, han∣ging on the Liuer, commonlie called the Gall: lest if that Choler should bee min∣gled with the blood, all the bodie would be yelowe, as it is in the yelowe Iaūdise And therfore nature hath ordained, that when Bloode is made in the Liuer, the Gall draweth frō it Cholerike humours to make it the more pure.ecur generaito∣is sanguinis. The vse and propertie of Cholere, is to flowe into the guttes, that it might scoure theim, and clense them from Flegmatike excremē∣tes, and that it might helpe their excre∣cion (that is) that it might raise and stire vp the vertue expulsiue, to driue out the egestions in due tyme. The Choler that is naturall, is hote and drie in operaciō, yelowe in colour,Melancholici u∣noris. and bitter in taste. As for Melancholie it is as it wer the
dregges, and grounde soppes of Blood, whiche if it be naturall, it is leste in quā∣titie of all humours. And it is to bee no∣ted, that nature hath appoincted a mem∣ber in mannes bodie,The profite of the splene. commonlie called the Splene or Milt, whiche draweth frō the blood, this blacke and yearthlie hu∣moure: leste if it should flowe with the bloode in the vaines, it would make the colour of the whole bodie blacke; as it chaunceth in the blacke Iaundise, wher∣in Melancholie floweth all ouer the bo∣die, with blood in the vaines. The splene therfore is ordained by nature, to drawe awaie the dregges, and thicke residence of the blood. The vse and propertie of the Melancholie in mannes body, is to nou∣rishe the Splene, and to helpe the acciōs and operacions of the stomack: for it cau¦seth the stomack to comprehende well in it self, meates that are receiued, and to retein and kepe them vntill thei be fully digested. The colour of natural Melan∣cholie is blacke like yearth: it is cold and drie in operacion, and sowre in taste.
These ar the qualities and quantities whiche are naturallie conteined in the humours of mannes bodie. But if it so chaunce, that any of these humours doe alter, by any meanes in quātitie, colour, substance, taste, or place, then thei cause sicknes little or moche, accordyng to the excesse or decrease, or malignaunt quali∣ties of the humors, declining frō his na∣tural state, which for breuitie I let passe. ¶The .vii. Chapiter. ¶Of the complexions of mannes bodie. THe auncient Phisicions doe saie,Temperamentū. Ignis. Aer. Aqua. Terra. that a cōplexion or temperament is nothyng els, but a mixture of the fower elementes: that is Fire, Aire, Water, and Yearth, and thei make .ix. sondrie kindes of complexions, one that is temperate, and eight that be not tem∣perate, whereof fower be simple, that is, hote or colde, or moiste, or drie. And .iiij. bee compounde, that is hote and moiste, or colde and moiste, hote and drie, or cold
and drie. But soche men as write, accor∣dyng to the capacitie, or vnderstandyng of the reader: thei do sate, that a comple∣xion is a mixture of the fower humours in mānes bodie, that is Blood, Flegme Choler, and Melācholie. And thei make but fower sondrie complexions, accor∣ding to the nomber of those humoures, whiche doctrine of theirs, although it be farre inferiour to the other, yet it is not vnprofitable, but worthie to bée marked of all menne: for, thereby thei maie haue cause to consider that somme humoure doth abounde more in some one manne, then in an other, whereby the qualities and disposicions of diuers men are alte∣red. It is necessarie therefore, for hym that would knowe, of what complexion hym selfe, or anye other persone is, to obserue and marke, as well the inward qualities and disposicions of the minde, as also the outwarde signes of the body, accordinge to the preceptes here nexte insuyng.
The bodye wherin bloud or ayer, hath dominion and preheminen doth abounde on heate and moisture, and it is counted Sanguine of complexion, & it may be kno¦wen by these signes. Mirth, iesting, & familiaritie, delight in pastimes. Liberalitie, and fréenes of harte, Simplicitie, and meane witte. Seldome angrie. Pulse great and swifte, and full. Fleshines of members, without fat, Prones to carnall luste. Largenes and fulnes of the vaines, & arreries. Aboundaunce of ordure and vrine, swette without euill sauoure. Aptnes to bleding at the nose, and flures of bloud, and diseases thereof. Colour of the face and bodie ruddie mixed with whyte and redde. Often dreaminges of bloud and redd thinges without feare. Desire of wyne, good digestion. Vrine reddishe, and often grosse. Reddishe heare in great abūdaunce.
The bodie wherin flee or water hath preheminence doth abounde in colde and moisture, and it is called heginatike of complexiō, whiche maye be knowē by these signes. Forgetfulnes. Dulnes of witte & sense in learning. Slouthfulnesse and hoai∣nesse in mouinge. Ouermuche stepines. Colours of the face & bodye, white sallow, pale or leady. Much fatnes without sound fleshe. The pulse small, slowe, seldome, & softe. Reumatike, & full of spittle, swete, white and thicke. Much moistor comming out at the nose and mouthe. Digestiō slowe and weake. Appetite of soure & sharpe meates. Smothe shynne without hears. Cowardli∣nes & feare. Vrine whitish pale & thin. Swette whi∣tish & vnsauery. Dreames of waters, snow & rain. &c. Whitish hears. Delighte in hote things, hurt ensuing cold things. Vaines smal & little apering.
The bodie wherin Cho∣er or Fire hath dominiō doeth abound in heate, and drines, and is named Cho∣lerike of com∣plexion, and it maie be kno∣wen by these signes. Rashenes in all thinges, quicke witte, Subtilitie, prodigalitie. Irefulnesse, boldenesse, and hardinesse, Desire of reuengement sharpelie, Hearines and roughnes. Drines, and leanesse of the bodie. Heare redde, Aburne, and curled. Coloure of the eyes and face yelowe, like the iaundise. The pulse great, swifte, and harde. The vrine like fine golde in colour, or like fire. Impatiente with hunger or thirste. Drynes of the tunge, and roughnes, Little filthe in the nose, and little spittle Sone very angrie, and sone appeased. Watching very longe, and often. Dreaminges of battaill, murder, fire, & bloudshed. Delight in colde thinges. Quicke and strong of digestion. Swifte and light of bodie▪ Often nawyng in the mouthe, of the stomacke and costiuenes in mid∣dellage.
The bodie wherin Me∣lancholie or yearth hath dominiō, doth abounde in coldnesse and drinesse, and is named me∣lancholie of complexion, & it may be kno¦wen by these signes. Grauitie and simplicitie. Euill disposition, so that of∣ten thei kill themselues. Enuie, couetousnes nigard¦nesse, fearfulnesse, sorowe, weping▪ kepīg secret cōs, solitarie, wittie, constant in opinion. Slowe to anger. Harde to please after anger. Leanesse and roughnesse of the whole bodie. Blacknesse or sartnesse of the face and skinne. Heare blacke and plain. Pulse slowe little and harde Vrine subcine, grenish or  bright and swearing. Oftentimes blacke  dreames of death, grauce; and soche like. Content with small sleping Impatiente of cold.
By these signes and qualities before rehersed, eche man may learne to know of what complexion he is of, if he wil di∣ligently cōsider the same. And note that it shalbe sufficient to iudge his cōplexiō to be according with y• humour to which for the moste part his qualities and out∣warde signes be agreing, and inclining. Although all the properties prescribed to the humour, doe not agree with him. For the disposition of the mynde, and also the state of the bodie, are oftentimes altered and chaunged from their natu∣rall course, sometime to better, and some time to worse, according to the good or euill education of the partie. As (among anie) this one example doth declare, whiche is written of auncient and cre∣dible Historiographiers. There was sometime in Grece a man which was named Zopirus, his vertue. who by be∣holding of a mans face, could knowe his complexion and iudge his condicions. This man beholding Socrates, an excel∣lent Philosopher, iudged him to be pro∣digall
and vnchast: Whiche iudgement whē Socrates familiar frendes had heard thei lawghed Zopirus to scorne, because they knewe Socrates to bee moste centi∣nent and thristie. But Socrates said vn∣to them, Zopirus hath nothing erred in his iudgement, for certainly I had been of soche qualities as he iudgeth me to be of, if I had not by Philosophie subdued nature. Hereby it is euident that natu∣rall dispositions of men may be altered. And that is the cause why all the quali∣ties and signes prescribed before in any of the complexions be not found to agree to euery particular mā of that cōplexiō, wherfore it is sufficient if the most of thē doe agree with him.☞ Note this well. The commodities that ensue the knowledge of a mannes owne complexion are many & notable, for thereby a man may learne to eschue the euill dispositions that he is natural∣ly inclined vnto, he may also make con∣iecture what trade of life is moste metest for him. Moreouer he shall sone learne thereby, what diet is profitable, to pre∣serue
him in health, and what is cōtrary to his nature. Besides these also he may learne thereby to knowe what diseases he is subiecte vnto moste, and so he may the better preuent them. As for example if a man by the signes and qualities pre∣scribed, knowe him selfe to be of a cole∣ricke cumplexiō, thereby he should haue iust occasion to bridle his naturall affec∣tions,Coloricke men are apte to be Capi∣taines & La∣wiers, but to hooe to bee Diuines. and endeuour to eschue rashenes, prodigalitie, hastines, and soche like. Al∣so thereby he may knowe that he is apte to learning, or to be a Lawier, or to be a Capitaine, or to doe any handie woorke wherein quickenes of witte, sleighte or subtiltie doth consiste without any great laboure. Also thereby he may learne y• often drinking of hote wynes, or eating of hote spices be noysome to him. Aboū∣daunce of swete meates honie, garlicke, and onions, may be but seldome vsed of him. He may learne also that his sto∣macke is so good of digestiō that almoste no groose meate can hurte him. Moreo∣uer, thereby he may learne, to know that
he is apte to fall into certian agues, ye∣lowe iaundies,Hote sicke∣nesses the causes. phrenesies, vomitinges, and soche like cholerique diseases, which if he will eschue, he must forbeare the thinges before rehersed, specially in Sō∣mer, and thē also he must learne of much labour and trauaile, of burning heate of the Sunne, and of great anger, and soch like thinges that inflame choler. The like commodities are to be searched out in other complexions, whiche diligent obseruation you may easely finde, wher∣in if they be able to enstructe the Phisicion, he may with more safetie, and spede, cure their diseases. ∴ Finis primi libi.
The seconde booke treateth of diet and foode, meete and necessarie for the bodie of man. And of suche herbes as a gardaine ought to be furnished withall, whiche be nede∣full in healthe and sicknes. ¶The first Chapiter. ❧ why man hath nede of nourishement. THe naturall heate whiche God hath ordained to be in mans body from the tyme of his generation vntill he departe out of this worlde doth continually waste and consume the substaunce of the members,. and therfore the whole bodie would sone bee wasted and consumed, vnlesse the like substaūce to that whiche is euaporate and spredde were daily engēdred in the body.Hypr, de . Ther∣fore nature hath engendred euen from the birth an appetite, & desire of meates & drinkes in eche mā, of whiche meates and drinkes receiued into the stomacke,
the same nature by alteration and dige∣stion of them maketh suche substaunce as eche member hath lost, that the body may long endure in good estate. This is the marueilous workyng of God and nature for the preseruatiō of mankinde, for we nede not to be taught of any bo∣die to eate,Deus lo. drinke or breath, but imme∣diatly after our generation, we haue those faculties and appetites engraffed in vs, whereby we can do them without a teacher. With meate when it is di∣gested and altered, is restored the drie & sounde substaunce that is wasted in the members, with drinke is restored the moister substaūce of the bodie that is cō∣sumed:Cibus, Potus, Aire, Hypo. de i. And so they are both reserued in their former state. By breathing and by mouing of the pulses, the ayre and the firie substaūce of the bodie, is nourished and refreshed. ¶The seconde Chapiter. ❧ Of the commodities and discommo∣dities of meates and drinkes. THe foode whiche is receiued into the stomacke by the mouthe, is there boy∣led
by naturalheate, and the iuice therof is sucked and drawen to the lyuer by cer¦taine vaines called Meseraicae, where it is purified,How Chy∣us to brde. and the best of it is turned & altered into bloud by the vertue of the li∣uer,How nature is nourished. and from thence that bloud is sente in vaines, into all partes of the bodie, with which bloud eche member is nou∣rished and restored, and by the operation of nature euery member hath bloud tur∣ned dailie into soche substaunce as the member is, whereby so muche is resto∣red to that member as naturall heate be∣fore hath wasted and consumed. Soch be the commodities of meates and drinkes if they be good and easie to digeste being taken in sufficient quantitie, good order and due time.How the nu∣tramentes ar infected. But if these circumstaun∣ces be not obserued, ther is scarcely any thing so pernicious to a mā. For so they be of great force, to engender greuous sicnesses, by engendring euill & vitious humours. These circumstaunces ther∣fore aforenamed, are diligently to be cō∣sidered and obserued of soche, as desire to
kepe their bodies in health.What, when, and at what tyme meate must be takē. First what they eate or drinke. Secondly howe moch. Thirdli after what sorte: And last of all at what time. For the first part, there ought hede to be taken, that the meates and drinkes whiche are to bee receiued into the sto∣macke, be good and holsome for the body. And therfore they must bee soche as will cause good iuyse, & engender good bloud, and soche as the stomacke is well able to digeste:Beefe is bet∣ter then a chi∣ken to a cho∣lorike bodie. For some stomack is more able of nature to digeste harde meates then many other. But note that the beste and moste holsome meates, ought to haue these properties. They must breed good iuyce, they must be light and easie of di∣gestion, and thei must be of a thinne sub∣staunce: for soche doe breede good hu∣mours in short time, without any ob∣structions and stoppinges of the vaines, and conduictes of the bodie. As for those meates that are of contrarie qualities to them aforesaid: they are hurtfull and noysome to the bodie. For soche meates
as be of euil iuyce, doe engender naugh∣tie and corrupte humours in the bodye. Soche as be harde of digestiō, doe debili∣tate and make wearie nature, ouerchar∣ging the alteratiue vertue of the sto∣mack.The nourish¦mentes of i∣uill foode. Soche as be of a grosse substaūce, doe breade obstructions and opilations, stopping the vessels that bee about the liuer, whereby for lacke of frée passage of bloud, and other humours, perilous feuers, and many other daungerous di∣seases be engendred. Moreouer, it is to be noted in this part, whiche teached to obserue what you eate or drinke, that the temperature of meates is to be marked and learned. For as long as a man is in health,Foode for healthfull bodies. soche meates as are of like tem∣perature to him selfe, are moste holsome for him and best, agreing to his nature. For this is a generall rule and precepte in phisicke, Similia similibus nutriuntur, that is as muche to saie, as thinges that are like are nourished by their like. And therfore hote meates are good to nourish hote complexions, colde meates are good
for colde complexions, drie for drie, like∣wise: and moiste meates good for moist complexions. The seconde thing which was saied,The quanti∣tie of meates. ought to be obserued in recei∣uing foode, was to take hede how much is receiued at one meale. Whosoeuer therfore entendeth to preserue him selfe in health, let him take hede that he dooe not vse to eate vs{que} ad sacietatem, that is as longe as he hath any appetite,Glotonie, the fruites therof or vn∣til he be stuffed ful: for excesse of meates doth ouercharge nature, suffocating & quenching naturall heate, so that some disease immediatly insueth, obserue ther¦fore in any case to bee contente with so moche meate as wil suffice nature, thin king it sufficient to haue hunger slaked, although the appetite be not fullie satis∣fied. This is a precepte moste worthy to be obserued of them that would prolong health, whiche thing is confirmed by a notable sentence, of the moste auncient famous, and excellent phisition Hypo∣crates, whiche is worthie to be borne in minde of all men. And it is this in latin,
Sanitatis studium est non satiari cibis▪ that is to saie: The meanes to preserue health, is to eschue sacietie & gluttonie of meates and drinkes.The waie to kepe healthe. Thirdly, there ought to be an order obserued in eating of meates: for albeit that it is moste hol∣some for all complexions, to eate of one kinde of meate only at one meale, (for so nature is able to make more perfecte di∣gestion thereof) yet because the greatest sorte of menne (specially if thei be weal∣thie) dooe commonlie vse to eate of sun∣drie meates at one meale, I thought it worthie of obseruacion, that there bee not a preposterous order vsed in eatyng of diuerse meates:Diuers mea∣tes at one meale are not holsome. for so diuersitie of mea¦tes might inferre greater daunger. Ob∣serue therefore to eate cōpitentely of one meate onely at one meale, and let it bee soche as will well agrée to your cōplexi∣on, and soche as you haue béen accusto∣med vnto. If any refuse to obserue this receipte, let them for the eschewinge of greater daunger, obserue and take hede that in diuersitée of meates, they vse to
eate soche thinges as be easie of digestiō, before meates that be of harde digestiō,Sdden be∣fore roste. and let them eate moiste meates before drie meates, and mollifiyng meates be∣fore binding and restrictiue meates. For if this order be obserued, there will lesse hurte insue.Note this. Last of all, it is not to be ne∣glected at what times meates & drinkes are to be receiued into the stomack. For foode receiued out of due time, doth ra∣ther hurte then nourishe, for the know∣ledge whereof there are fiue thinges to be considered. The age, the time of yere, the complexion, the countrie, and the custome.Age, Tyme, Complexion Region and custome. As for example, a childe or a young man, vntill he be past .xx. yeares of age, in wynter or springtime, being Cholerick or Sanguine of complexion, dwelling in a colde region, and hauing vsed to eate often: soche a one ought to féede often. But contrariwise, a manne that is past .xxx. yeares of age. in Sum∣mer and haruest time, being flegmatike or Melancolike of complexiō, dwelling in a hote region, and accustomed to eate
but seldome, soche a one ought to féede seldome.The hotter the bodie is, the soner doe meate digest. Also these aforesaied respectes, being seuerally considered, dooe partely declare the times of eating. For a childe may eate more oftener then anye other age. A cholerick complexion oftener thē any other complexiō. Likewise in win∣ter, a man that is in health, may eate oftener then in Sommer. And so forthe, is to be vnderstanded of the reste. And the contrary of the contraries.In Winter heate is dra∣wen to the in¦ward partes. But note generally that it is good for the preser∣uation of health, if those whiche bee in health, doe not vse to eate meate before that the meate whiche they did eate last, before be digested, hauīg exercised their bodies with some pastime or labour, and then as sone as hūger and appetite pro∣uoke them, let them eate competently. I thinke it be moste holsome for theim that leade a quiet and idle life [excepte they bée cholerick of complexion] to bée content with twoo meales in one daye, that is dinner and supper. And let there be vij. or viij. howers,Tyme be∣twene mea∣les. betwene meales,
and let them eschue by all meanes pos∣sible, drinking or banquetting betwene meales. But soche as vse daily great bo¦dely laboure, or that exercise themselfes moch in any pastime or trauaile, or that be of a choeerick complexion, soche per∣sones sins the coldnes of our countrie, & also custome doe permitte it.Complexion and region obserued. They may safely vse to eate three meales a daie, that is, breakefast, dynner, and supper, so that there bee fiue or sixe howres be∣twene either of them. But let them ob∣serue that their chief labour and exercise be before meate,Note this. for labour or exercise af¦ter meates, is very hurtfull to the body, for because it maketh aboundaunce of crude and rawe humours in the vaines and conduites of the body. ¶The .iii. Chapiter. ¶Of diuersities of meates. IT is moste certainly confirmed by the autoritie of aūcient phi∣sicions, and proued also by dai∣ly experience,Gal. de huribus. that humours ar
bredde in mannes bodie, as the iuyce of the meate that he receiueth is apte to make.It is true, yt euill meates will make e∣uill iuice: euē so good mea∣tes to the bo∣die ful of foule humers dooe tourne to the worse parte. For the ser∣pente and the Bee sucketh Honie & poi∣son, bothe of one herbe. And therfore there ought no litle regarde to be had, what kinde of foode is to bee vsed. For as meates of good iuyse doe engender good bloud, & pre∣serue health, so cōtrariwise soch meates as breade ill iuyse, do engendre vicious and corrupt humours, and doe cause di∣uerse and many perilous diseases. Note therefore that of meates, some be easie of digestion, and some harde of digestion. And of either of them some bee of good iuyce, and some of euil iuyce. Also some meates be apte to breede melancholie, some fleme, and some choler. Of whiche it would require long time to make par¦ticuler rehersal. I will only in the chap∣ters following brieflye declare whiche meates are accoumpted to make good iuyce, whiche make euil iuyce, & whiche are in a meane betwene them bothe. ¶The .iiii. Chapiter. ❧ Of meates makyng good iuyce.
THese meates followinge, are easie of digestion, and are wōte to make good iuyce in a haile body, that is to say: partriches, Fesantes,Meates best for tender∣lynges. Chickens, Capons, Hennes, Small byrdes that vse to be vpon moū∣taines, newe laide egges, reare or pot∣ched, younge porke, veale, newe milke, freshe fishe that be in grauellie and sto∣nie riuers.Note also milke is hurt¦full to theim, whiche haue a Feuer, as Hypocrates affirmeth, Lac capud dolentibus malum▪ To these may be added bread made of the flower of good wheate, be∣ing well leauened, sufficiently salted, & well baken in an ouen, being twoo or three daies olde. And also pure wyne. These with many other thinges which for breuitie I leaue out if they be taken in meane quantitie in due order & time, they engēder good bloud, and nourishe the bodie quickely. ¶The .v. Chapiter. ❧ Of meates engendring corrupt humours, because they be of ill iuyce. THese meates following are harde of digestion,Like doe in∣gēder the like and dooe moste commonly
make euill iuyce in a healthfull bodie, (that is) Bacon made of olde swyne,Mentes eiuil for idle people but holsome for them that labour. old biefe, tame Duckes, tame Géese, when they are olde, olde mutton, puddinges made of the bloud of beastes, tripes, and sowse, harde chese, shell fishes, vnripe fruite eaten rawe, rawe herbes & soche like. To these maie be added vnleuened bread baken vnder the ashes, and wine that is very new thicke, or sower. These and soche like, doe seldome or rather ne∣uer breede good bloude in any mannes bodie. And therefore it is good to eschue then, although labouryng men maye often vse them without any great hurt ensuing, by meanes of their great bodi∣ly laboure & vehement exercises, wher∣by the hurte that would ensue is auoi∣ded by swette and other excrementes. ¶The .vi. Chapiter. ❧ Of meates whiche are in a meane. I Counte all soche meates to bée in a meane,The meane is beste. betweene those meates that bée rehersed in the ij. former chapiters whiche ei∣ther
be somewhat hard of digestion, but being well digested, doe make indiffe∣rent good iuyce, or els soche meates as doe abounde with superfluous humidi∣ties and excrementes whereby fleme & viscious humors be engēdred. To these adde soche meates as be clammy and do make obstructions and opilations, and soche other like. Of al these sortes I wil reherse some particuler examples,Meates of the best nu∣trament and worste. wher¦by you may the better consider the rem∣naunt. Yong bief, Muttō, Kidde, Lābe, Conies, Pigges, all water foules be∣ing yonge, salte fleshe, and fishe, harde egges, newe chese, Creame, Rie bread, Venison, ripe fruites, and diuerse other thinges of like sorte to some of these, whiche at this present I pretermitte. Nowe I wil entreate of herbes, whiche be moste vsed of healthfull folkes, and be necessarie against diuerse diseases. ¶The .vii. Chapiter. ❧ Of a gardeine.
SInce herbes are so diuersly & often vsed of all kinde of peo∣ple in pottage, brothes, Sal∣lettes,Mathiolus in prol. Dioscoridi. and sauses. And be also founde by long experience to bee moste holsome and profitable against an infi∣nite nomber of diseases, I can not but la¦mente the wilfull folie of those, that nei∣ther thēselues will haue good gardeins, and to plante, and sowe good stoore of herbes therein: neither yet doe regarde the knowledge of the vertues and ope∣rations of soche herbes as are dailie in vse. But if their finger dooe but ake a little,Commoditie good cheape. they couet to haue a medicine that is brought out of India, or from the fur∣thest parte of the worlde. Where as in deede (according to the saiyng of Plini) they daily doe treade vpon soche herbes as be able to remedie many dieases, but their ignoraunce causeth theim to con∣temne them as weedes, good for no pur∣pose. And contrariwyse, I counte them worthy of great praise & of continuance of health, whiche being of abilitie, wyll
no lesse endeuoure them selues to haue a faire gardein well stored with a great nomber of good and holsome herbes, thē they will prepare to haue a gorgeous house finely furnished with many ne∣cessary implemētes since the commodi∣ties thereof be so great. For as a house is a place for a mannes reste and ease, wherein he kepeth his gooddes frō the∣ues and robbers,Ab altissimo  est medicin. euen so a garden is a place of pleasure and delight, wherein be herbes that will keepe a mans bodye from diseases and sicknes, if he liste to learne their vertues & qualities, whiche all men ought to be willing to doe, that haue any regarde to their health. For at the beginning as it appeareth in ye firste of Genesis. Almighty God did ordeine herbes and fruites, to bee sustinaunce & foode for man: saiyng vnto Adam and Eua, after that he had blessed theim in this wyse. Beholde, I haue geuen vnto you all herbes that bringe foorth seede vpon the earth, and all fruites of trees, to be meate for you. Here it appeareth,
that by Goddes ordinaunce, herbes and fruites dooe suffice to nourishe and su∣steine mannes nature. As vndoubtedly not onely Adam and Eue were nouri∣shed by herbes & fruites, but also great multitudes of people in diuerse ages, haue béen, and at this present be nouri∣shed & fedde onely with herbes, rootes, & fruites. And we our selues although ac∣cording to the custome of our progeni∣tours, vse to cate fleshe and fishe of di∣uerse sortes, yet haue wee daiely herbes and fruites in vse to nourishe oure bo∣dies withall,The profite of a good gar∣deine. and to cure suche diseases as mans bodie is subiecte vnto. In con∣sideration whereof, I wyshe and coun∣saile, as many as be able, to prepare for themselues a gardaine plotte, and to plante, sette, and sowe therein, so many sundrie herbes as they can learne to be holsome and good for their bodies being in health, and profitable against cōmon diseases, that it may bee vnto them in steede of a Poticaries shoppe, when the Phisicion shall appointe them by his bil
a remedy whiche they should make for their griefe, or when there is a diet pre∣scribed theim.How to place a garden. First, therefore whosoe∣uer entendeth to haue a gardeine, lette him chose a plotte on the Southe side or East side of his house, let the quantitie therof be according as he shal iudge suf¦ficient for his vse, let it not be nighe to a barne, for the dust and chaffe of corne de¦stroieth herbes, if you couet to set your herbes in Septēber about Michelmas time,To trim a garden, bothe the maner and tyme, then let your grounde be plowed or digged in the Spring time, in March or Aprill, that the heate and drienes of the Sommer may make it mellowe. But if you will beginne to gardaine in Februarie or Marche, let your grounde be ploughed or digged in September or October, that the frostes and colde of the wynter may make the yearth mete for your purpose, laye compasse vppon the grounde a moneth before you will sette or sowe any thinge, and lette it be horse dunge or shepes dūge, and let it be del∣ued into the ground a wéeke before you
sowe any séede, or sette any herbes, lette your grounde be suerly and closely fen∣sed with a wall or a pale, or a double quicke set hedge, that no cattell nor pul∣trie can come into it. Prouide that there be continually water nighe the gardain plotte,To water your garden. whiche thinge if you woulde be sure of, digge a well in August, for that wil not be destitute of water al ye yeare. When your grounde is readie, then set and sowe, herbes and séedes, the Moone being in the encrease, that is betwene ye chaunge and the full,Whā to sowe your seedes. and let the Moone be in one of these signes: Taurus, Virgo, or Capricorne, whiche you may learne to knowe in the ende of this treatise. ¶The .viii.

Chapiter. ¶The vertue and temperamentes of soche herbes as be named in the former Chapiter. 1. Borage. Borago. BOrage is hotte and moiste in the first degree,Diosc. cap. 122. In vino animi voluptates auget it is a comfortatiue to the harte, and the vital spirites. The wine wherin Borage hath béen stieped, beyng drounke, doeth cause mirthe and gladnesse. The flowers of

BVglosse is of thesame tempera∣ture,Diosco. lib. iii. Cap. 22. that Borage is of: and thei bee in maner of like vertues. A Iulep or decoction made of Bu∣glosse or Borage, doeth quenche thirste, and prouoke vrine, and thei are good a∣gainste diseases of the Liuer. The flou∣res of Buglosse would bee saued like like sorte, as is before saied of Borage. 3. Betes. Beta. BEtes bee of twoo sortes,Diosc. lib. ii. Cap. 116. Capud purgat aurium dolori∣bus auxiltatur. white and blacke: white Betes do lo∣sen the bealie, beyng taken in meane quantitee, but either of them cause euill iuice, and doe hurte the stomacke, if thei be abundauntly eaten. Thei nourishe but little. Thei bee verie good againste obstruccions of the Liuer and Splene: if thei bee eaten with Mu∣starde
and Vineger, specially the white Betes. Thei are of a scouryng and ab∣stersiue qualitie: The iuice of them pur∣geth the hedde, beyng put into the nose∣thrilles.

But besi∣des the herbes that are planted in gar∣deins, ther ar diuerse herbes that growe of their owne accorde in ye fieldes, which haue notable vertues for sundrie disea∣ses. And therefore I would wyshe all men and women to doe their endeuour, to knowe thē and learne their vertues.

Chapiter. ❧ A declaracion of sicke∣nes and health. I Thinke it were superfluous to declare, that healthe is profita∣ble and pleasaunt to al menne, since eche man daily doeth wish and praie, either for the restitucion, or for the continuaūce of thesame. But I sup∣pose
it be nedeful to declare, what health is, and wherein it consisteth, that there∣by the ignoraunt maie learne to knowe when thei are in perfecte health, & when thei be enclined to sicknesse. Note there∣fore, that healthe is a naturall affeccion and state of the bodie, wherein eche mē∣ber is able to doe that office and accion, that nature hath ordained it for, partly, as the stomacke to digeste perfectly, and to haue good appetite.Note this. &c. Note also, that this naturall state doeth remain so long in eche member, as it kepeth the natu∣rall temperature, that it should haue, in heate, cold, moistnes and drines: and al∣so hath thesame forme, quantitie, nom∣ber, and place, that nature hath ordai∣ned it to haue. If these thinges bee pre∣sent to eche member of the bodie, then is the hole bodie in perfect health. Excepte some externall cause dooeth hinder it, as a wounde, pricke, brouse, or some soche like outwarde euente, whiche doe demi∣nishe healthe, and cause some sickenesse. Note therefore, that sicknes is contrary
to health, and therefore it is not harde to knowe what sickenes is, and wherein it doeth consiste. Howbeeit, I will declare somwhat of it, that it maie bee the more plainlier vnderstanded of all menne. Sickenes is an vnnaturall affeccion and state of the bodie, wherein some mē∣ber is hindred and letted, that it can not perfectly fulfil that office and action, that nature hath ordained it to doe: as when the stomacke dooeth lothe meate, or can not kepe it til it be digested. &c And note that this vnnaturall affeccion of the bo∣die,Distempe∣raunce. doeth consiste in the members of the bodie,Euill forme. three diuers waies, for either it commeth by distempure of some mem∣ber, so that it is hotter, colder, moister, or drier, then it should be of nature: Or els by vndecent fashion, quantitie, nomber, or place of some member. Or last of all, by solucionSolucion. and disheue∣ring of some partes, by vlcers, impostu∣mes, woundes, or soche like: which par∣tes wer ordained by nature to be ioyned together, and therefore the separacion of
them is a disease. These bee the diuersi∣ties of diseases, whiche when thei chaūce in mānes bodie: there is a strief and bat∣taill, betwene nature and them, whiche shall ouercome other. And if sick∣nes ouercome nature, then doeth death insue: but if nature dooe ouercome the sickenes, then the bodie by little and lit∣tle, is restored to health again. And note that in this combare, betwen the disease and nature, the Phisicion is as it were a minister and aider to nature, to help her to ouercome the disease, by soche mea∣nes as the arte of Phisicke doeth teache hym, maie beste bee doen: For there are sondrie kindes of aides, whiche are to be sought out by this meanes. First, it is to bee noted, that this is a moste generalle precepte in Phisicke:Contraries doe cure their contraries. Contraria contra∣rijs curantur, that is, diseases are cured by their contraries, and therefore, if the disease bee a distempure of hotte, colde, moiste, or drie, whereby any parte of the bodie is altered from his naturall state, then to help nature against that distem∣pure,
you must applie or minister a me∣dicine, that is cōtrary to it, that is, a cold medicine to a hotte disease, a hotte medi∣cine to a cold disease, a drie medicine to a moiste disease. And this muste bee dooen with diligente obseruacion, or els there is daunger in it, rather then profite. As for an example. If a little distempure of heate should happen to a member of the bodie, there might bee applied so colde a medicine to it, that would alter the mē∣ber into a greater distēpure of cold, then the heate was. Note therefore, that the temperature of eche member, muste bee learned & considered, whē it is in health, and then the distempure must diligently be noted, how moche it diffreth from the said temperature, for so moche must the medicine differ on the cōtrary parte. As for example. If a member were distem∣pured, that it were twoo degrees hotter then it was beyng in healthe, then must the medicine bee twoo degrees colder, then the temperature of the mēber was. And so by that meanes, the twoo cold de∣grees
of the medicine, will destroie and quenche the two hote degrees of distem∣pure, and will bryng the member again into his naturall temperature. Thus a due proportion diligently to be consi∣dered alwayes betwene the disease and the medicine, or els ther will rather hard then good insue. But  a disease be cau∣sed by aboundaunce of humours in the bodie, whiche  to oppresse nature, then the phisicion helpeth nature by ta∣king away some part of the aboundaūce of those  humours, whereby nature is the  able to ouercome y• in short time. And note that this takyng awaie of humours is dooen diuersely, accordyng as occasion best ser∣ueth: Sometyme by settyng of , sometyme by purgacion, or vomite: and sometyme by prouoking of sweate, or o∣therwise, these and soche like are some∣time the doinges of the Phisicion, wher∣with he helpeth nature, against the dis∣ease of repleacion; in whiche the former rule is obserued. That is, to heale by cō∣traries,
for euacuacion and pourgyng, bée contrarie to repleacion and fulnes of humours. But in dooyng of these thyn∣ges, there ought diligent heede to be ta∣ken, that thei bee attempted in a conue∣nient tyme: and that thei be dooen with good measure, that is not to little, nor to moche. And further consider where, howe, and with what you were beste to worke that nature maie thereby receiue more cōmoditie then hinderaunce:When the Phisici, & how the Phi¦sicion should minister. Here therefore, the helpe of a skilfull and cir∣cumspecte Phisicion is moste requisite, for if euacuacion by pourging, bloodlet∣tyng, sweatyng, or otherwise, be dooen out of tyme, out of measure, or contrarie to that whiche is requisite, as if you doe pourge, when bloodletting is onely ne∣cessarie, then is the disease aided against nature, wherby greater daūger of death dooeth ensue, then would haue dooen, if nature had been let a lone. But to con∣clude briefly, note, that in all diseases the duetie of the Phisicion is, to vse the con∣trarie remedie to the disease, that healthe
maie bee restored, as to take awaie that, whiche is superfluous, & to adde to that, whiche lacketh, to soften hardnesse, and to rarifie grossenes, and contrariwise, al∣waies endeuouryng to recouer the na∣turall state of the member diseased. Like¦wise in hollowe vlcers and woundes, to cause fleshe to growe, and to set in again bones that are out of ioynt, and soche o∣ther like: alwaies addyng, subtractyng, or amondyng that whiche is wantyng, haboundyng, or out of his dewe forme and place. ¶The. xii. Chapiter. ❧ What thynges the Phisicion ought to knowe before be attempte the cure of any disease. I Haue declared sufficiētly in the former Chapiter, how that it is the propertie of nature onely, to striue and fight againste disea∣ses.The Phisi∣cion is but a scruaunte. And how that the Phisiciō is but the minister, and seruaunt of nature, either to adde soche thynges to her, as she maie vse to destroie the disease withall, or els
by pluckyng cleane awaie, the greatesse parte of that matter, whiche causeth and maintaineth the sicknes. And therefore it is mete and necessarie for the Phisiciō before he minister any thyng, to learne and searche out perfectly, the cause of the disease, in whiche if he be ignoraunte, it is more by good fortune then by cun∣nyng, that he cureth any disease. For, how is it possible to help nature wt that, that she hath nede of, excepte it bee firste knowen what she needeth, whiche none can knowe, excepte the cause of the dis∣ease be manifeste to hym, so that he maie minister thinges directly, contrary to the cause of the disease. And therefore I can not but lamente the ignoraunce of the common people, that are perswaded, that one medicin is sufficient for one disease, not consideryng that one disease maie come of sondrie causes. And therefore it necessarilie requireth diuerse medicines As for example, weakenesse of the sto∣macke, that it cannot digest well, or that it hath no good appetite, is one disease,
whiche neuerthelesse may bee caused a dosen sundrie wayes, therefore the cure of it can not be alwayes with one medi∣cine, but rather in eche cause with a sun∣dry medicine. As if weakenes of the sto∣make come of a colde distēpure of it selfe only, then it must be made hote bosome meanes. If heate causeth the weakenes then it must be cooled. Likewyse you must moisten drines,Ex pituita oritu sanguis. and drie moisture. But if the weakenes be caused of some humour that doth abounde whiche hath flowed into the stomake, or hathe been there engendred, then must that super∣fluous humour be pourged out, either by vomite or purgation, with a meke medicine. As if it be fleme, with a medi∣cine that expelleth fleme, if choler be a∣bounding there, then must it be soche a medicine as pourgeth choler. And like∣wyse for Melancholie, a mete purgatiō must be vsed to drawe out the humour. But if the imbecillitie of the stomake be caused by a distilation and rewme that falleth out of the head into it, then is the
cure to be wrought in the head, and not at all in the stomake. And likewyse if distempure of the liuer or splene, dooe weaken the stomake, the cure consisteth in healing those members, and not in ministring any thing for the stomake, for it wilbe well as sone as they are cu∣red. Thus it is declared at large in one example the diuersitie of causes in one disease, that thereby all men might likewyse consider that euery disease in eche member of the bodie may and doth likewyse come of diuerse causes, against which causes if the medicines be not di∣rectly ministred, it auaileth nothinge, but rather hurteth, Therefore let no man thinke it suffi∣cient for the Phisicion, if he knowe that a man hath soche a disease: as the ague, the Colicke, the Flixe, or soch other like, that then he may straightwaye (if he be conning) minister a medicine mete for it.Finde forthe the cause, thā the medicine. No, not so, but he must first searche by al meanes possible the verie cause of the disease, which the ignoraūt people haue
long time been persuaded, that a cun∣ning Phisition may doe in all diseases, by the onely fighte and inspection of the vrine.Stereus et vrinae medicorum fer∣cula prima. But alas, thei are craftely bewit∣ched or couetously blinded. For to come to the knowlege of the cause of some in∣ward disease, the vrine profiteth no∣thing. And in moste inwarde diseases of the bodie, there ought as good regard to be had to the pulse, and to the disposici∣ons and state of the brain of the sicke, as there should be of the vrin. Also the ege∣stions, sweate, spettle, and other excre∣mētes ar not to be neclected, in so moche as at some time, thei do declare the cause of the disease, and the state thereof, when the vrine sheweth nothyng at all. As for exāple.Signa pleuritidis In a pleurisie, or in an inflama∣cion of the lunges, or in a squinancie, or soche like. There is more to be knowen by spittle, then by Vrine, likewise in a laxe, or in a bloodie flixe, or in a Colike, or Iliacke, there is more certaintie of iudgemente to bee geuen by egestion or ordure, then is by vrine: whiche thinges
those that bee not altogether addicte, so their own fantasie, maie quickly by good reason,Vrina non est nisi sanguinis ex∣cremenium & a∣re ibus attractu at  hanc per v∣rinarios meatus in vuieam de∣latum. be perswaded to credite. For V∣rine is nothyng els but the watrie and whaishe parte of the blood: for it is strai∣ned from blood in the Liuer, and sucked from thense into the raines, from whens it distilleth doune into the bladder, and so passeth forthe. Since therefore, vrine is the excremente that is separate from blood: there is good cause why it should shewe the estate of the liuer, and of blood in all partes of the bodie. And also it can well declare the estate of soche members as it passeth by, as of the raines, the bla∣der, and soche like. But certainlie in o∣ther diseases that bee out of the vaines, and be distaunt frō the places, by which the vrin passeth, there is no certain iud∣gemente to bee geuen by the vrine, vn∣lesse the vehemencie of the disease, hath infected the blood or liuer, after some sort Neuerthelesse, soche is the ignoraunce of the common people, that thei thinke him worthie of no estimaciō in Phisick,
whiche can not at the first sight of the v∣rin (although it hath been caried .xx. mi∣les) tell whether it be a mannes water, or a womānes, and how the disease gre∣ueth the paciente, better then hymself, & also whether he shall liue or die, what disease so euer it be, whiche thinges vn∣doubtedly, in diuerse diseases are impos∣sible, to be tolde by the onely sight of the vrine. And therefore it is thought méete for hym, that will minister Phisick due∣ly and rightfullie: First to se the pacient and to talke with hym or her,Vsus pulsus. whether it be. Then to feele the pulse, & to obserue well the state thereof: nexte to viewe di∣ligentlie the excrementes, not onely the vrine, but also the ordure, spitell and sweate. Laste of all, to haue respect to the place where grief is, and to consider the accidentes that rise therof, not omitting to knowe the former diete, and trade of life of the sicke. These thynges then be∣yng diligentlie and seuerallie marked, the Phisicion maie more certainly learn the cause of the disease, the strength ther∣of,
and to what ende it will come, then he could by seyng the vrine onelie. And by that meanes he maie minister amete medicine for it, whereby the sicke shall sone finde ease,Blinde ba∣yarde is bol∣deste. and hymself great good fame. Otherwise, he might by his error and ignoraunce, tormēt the sicke worse, and bring perill of death, to his vtter re∣proche. Thus haue I partlie declared, what thynges ought to bee knowen of the Phisiciō, that thereby he might with drawe and take awaie, the fonde and fo∣lishe opinion, that a great nomber of the countrie dooe credite, to be true (that is) that the sight of the vrine is sufficiente inough for a cūning Phisicion, to know the disease of the sick, and the cause ther∣of, and to minister apte medicine for it. ¶The .xiii. Chapiter. ❧Of the vse and commodities of pour∣ging and bloudletting. MOte that if the bodie of man doe abounde with humours, whiche are ready to oppresse nature, then whether ther be
sicknes in the body present by meanes of them, or if there be but daūger of sick∣nes, those humours must bee euacuate out of the bodie, either by bloudletting or by pourging, or by vomite, swetting, or bathes, or by some other kinde of eua∣cuation. But I wil speake here onely of euacuation by bloudletting and pour∣ging. And first of bloudletting. There be diuerse thinges to be cōsidered before bloudletting.Age. Custome. Complexion. The age of the patient, the complexion, the time of the yeare, the region, the custome, the strengthe, & the vehemencie of the disease. The age must be considered, because children vn∣der 14. yeares of age, and old folke may not be let bloud without great necessitie require it. The complexion is to be no∣ted, because a hote complexiō hath large vaines, and aboūdeth with much bloud. And therfore they may forbeare a good deale of bloud. But coole complexions haue narrowe vaines and little bloude, and therfore their euacuation must bee small.Tyme. The time of the yeare must bee
marked that the weather be not to hote nor to colde. And therfore the springtime is moste apte time for bloud letting, be∣cause it is temperate. The region and countrée is rehersed,Tempus, habi∣tus, regio. because it is to be noted that if the regiō be very hote, or very colde, it is not good to let bloud: a temperate region is mea∣test for it. Custome is not to be neglec∣ted, for thereby we may know that they that haue ben accustomed to blede, may better suffer bloud letting thē those that neuer were letten bloud. The strengthe of the persone must be regarded, for if there be great weakenes, it is very daū∣gerous to let bloud at all, except extreme necessitée compelleth. Also the vehemē∣cie of the disease is worthie to bee mar∣ked: for if it be a vehement disease, you must let bloud streight, if the former cir∣cumstaunces doe suffer it. These thinges considered, if thei wil permitte bloud letting, and if it bee in a necessarie cause, it shalbe good and expe∣dient to knowe in what signe the moone
is, for you must take hede that she be not in the signe that gouerneth that mem∣ber,Gal. lib. ii. de temp. Cap. v. Malio que abun∣dant sanguine idioque copio∣sam ferunta cuationem. wherein you entende to open the vaine, and also forsee that she be in soche a signe as is good to let bloud in, which the table in the ende of this booke, wyll teache you. The vses and commodities of bloudletting, are as foloweth. First, this is a general rule, that bloudletting is a very good and moste conuenient re∣medy for all diseases that bee engendred of aboundaunce, flowing or eruption of bloud, as be chiefly the feuers called Sy∣nochi. Also the phrenesie, squinancie, pleurisi, peripneumony, opthalmie, & a∣gainst al inflammations, and impostu∣mations, engendred of bloud in the ly∣uer, the splene, the raynes, the wombe, the share, the armeholes, the armes, the legges: to conclude in al inward or out∣warde partes, wheresoeuer the infla∣mation bee, bloudletting is good for it, whether it be nowe present, or that ther be daunger that it will shortely engen∣der. Also bloudletting is good in feuers,
whether they be continual or intermit∣tent, if so bee the obstructions and stop∣pinges of the vaines, be caused of immo¦derate repletion of humours. And note that bloudletting, dothe emptie and enuacuate from the bodie, all humours alike, as wel good as bad. And therefore it is chiefly to bee vsed,Great abosi∣dāce in blood requireth to open a vaine. when there is to great an aboundaunce in the bodie of bloud & other humours, whiche do straine and stuffe the vaines, that there is a great daunger and ieo∣perdie and breaking of some vaine, or bruysing out of some flure of bloud or of choking, and ertinguish natural heate. And therfore in soche cases you must let bloud with all spede, although sicknes be not already present. For by lettinge bloud in due season, the superfluous ful∣nes of y• vaines, is brought into a meane state againe, the paines that came of ful∣nes and stretching of the vessels bee ea∣sed: The heauines that was felt in the bodie is taken awaye, and the bodie is lightened, and made more quicke and
nimble to doe all soche actions as na∣ture hath ordained it to doe. Also it cau∣seth natural heat to haue a larger scope, and a free passage by opening and emp∣tiyng the straightwayes & passages of the vaines and arteries. Last of all if it be done in time, it preuenteth diseases, into the whiche the bodie was ready to haue fallen. Many more commodities might here be rehersed of bloudletting,Moche pro∣fite in blood lettyng. whiche is done when it ought, and as it oughte to be done, but to conclude (omitting all o∣ther) note for a generall rule, that bloud letting is good against all kinde of di∣seases whiche be caused and engendred of bloud, not onely when the diseases ar present, but also it is good letting bloud to preuente any soche diseases if they be forséen or feared, alwayes obseruinge that there be none of these impedimētes aforesaid, whiche prohibite and forbidde bloud letting, except it be in great ne∣cessitie and extremitie, for then as the prouerbe is, Necessitas non habet legē,
that is: necessitie hath no lawe. Here woulde I leaue of to speake of bloudletting, but that there commeth to my mynde the common opinion of the ignorante people, which dooe certainly beleue that if any persone be let bloud one yeare, he muste bee lette bloud li∣kewyse euery yeare,A good note. or els he is in (I can not tell) howe great daunger, whiche fonde opinion of theirs, whereof soeuer it sprong at the firste, is no more like to be true, then I should saie, when a man hath a great wounde by chaunce in any part of his body, wherby he loseth moch bloud, after it is healed he must nedes haue the like woūde again the next yeare to auoyde as moche bloud, or els he is in daunger of great sickenes or of deathe. Whiche opinion if I did affirme it to be true (although it bee moste false) yet I might vse the like reason and autoritee to defende it, that the common people vse for theirs: for they can saye nothing if they be asked why they thinke so, but that they haue hearde manye saye soo.
Therefore I would wishe that no man should credite any longer this foolishe opinion, being moste false, onle she can shewe good reason for it, whiche I am sure no manne can dooe. Mary this I thinke that like as bloud letting is not good against al diseases, so also it is not good in all persones, but onely in those that will be content to vse afterwarde a moderate,Quando sangū vehementer as bundat▪ and conuenient diet. Those therefore that doe abounde with bloude & wilbe let bloud to preserue themselfes from the daunger of any disease, that is like shortly to ensue and moleste them. They must longtime after be contente to vse a moderate and conuenient diet, for those whiche be vntemperate & glut∣tonous in meates or great drinkers, and wyne bibbers, they do not only receiue no commoditie at all by bloud lotting, but also often times they catche more hurte by it then they should haue hadde without it, for in three or foure dayes space after, they fill & stuffe them selues with more rawe iuyces and humours,
(by meanes of vnmeasurable diet) then thei had before, and often times thei dye through conuulcion.Si ebrius quispiā repente obmutu∣erit conuulsus moritur. And therefore note that there is soche force & vertue in mo∣derate diete to eschue & decline diseases, that without the obseruatiō of it, bloud∣letting is to no purpose. And therefore if the commō saiyng of the people be true in any body, that they must be let bloud often, if thei be ones let bloud, it is onely true in soche as kepe an immoderate di∣et streight after bloud letting, and ther∣fore I counsaile all men to beware of ex∣cesse in eating and drinking after bloud lettyng. Also note yt after bloud letting, none ought to walke apace or to runne, or to vse any vehement exercise, but let him be quiet and reste him self vntill his spirites berefreshed and quieted againe. Note also, that none ought to slepe im∣mediatly after bloudletting, but let him kepe himselfe quiet & watche, auoydyng all contention and exercise of bodie and mynde. About twoo houres after bloud letting, there may a little foode be taken,
but let it be soche as wil make good iuice and nourishe a pace, within .iiij. howers after bloud letting or somewhat afore, it may be permitted to the patient to slepe, so that it be prouided for and taken hede of, that he turne him not vpon the arme where the vain was opened, nor that he doe not loosen the bande, and so lette the bloud flowe out again. Afterward lette him vse a straight and sparing diet, dai∣ly encreasing it by little and little, vntill you be come to your accustomed diet. And note that the morning is the me∣test tyme for blood lettyng,Sanguis qu tempore  tendus. when euery digestiō is perfectly finished, and the su∣perfluities and excrementes of eche of them auoided out, whiche must be fore∣seen that thei bee so. Or at the leaste in a time of necessitie the next apt time to let bloud is, when the stomake is somwhat emptie, that is, sixe or eight houres after meate. Thus moche for bloudletting. Nowe for pourging, whose vse and cō∣modities I promised to declare. It is to be noted, that euery kinde of
purgation hath that secrete vertue and propertie in it self, that when it is recei∣ued in a mans body and is prouoked to exercise, the vertue that it hath by natu∣rall heate labouring to digeste it, then it draweth vnto it soche humour as it hath power and vertue to pourge. And ther∣fore a pourgation is an euacuatiō of vi∣tious & corrupt humours, whiche trou∣ble and moleste the bodie, but not of all corrupte humours alike. For eche pour¦ging medicine doth draw vnto it one pe∣culier & propre humour, (that is) either fleme or choler, or melancholie, or wate∣rie humours.Who must be purged, and how. And therefore those that be perfectly in health, ought not to take a purgation, since they doe not abounde with corrupt humours, wherefore in those when the medicine findeth no soch superfluous humours as it hath vertue to drawe, it consumeth and wasteth the bloud and the fleshe. And for that cause, hole folkes are not pourged by pour∣gations, but rather consumed & wasted, for it is manifest hereby, that pourga∣tions
be very perillous to them that bée in perfect health, whiche thinge is testi∣fied also of Hippocrates in the .xxxvij. Aphorisme, of his seconde booke, where he saieth after this sorte.Pourge no hole bodies. Qui corpore bene se habent hos purgare periculosum est, (that is) it is daungerous pourging of those that be in perfect health. Also be cause eche pourging medicine hath ver∣tue to drawe one peculier humour, there is good hede to be takē that soche a me∣dicine bee ministred as hathe vertue to drawe the humour abounding, and no other, or els instede of moch good which it would do if it were conueniently mi∣nistred, it may contrariwyse doe moche hurte. According to the saiyng of Hipo∣crates in the last Aphorisme of his firste booke, in this maner. Si qua lia oportet purgari purgentur, confert, & facile fe∣ruut,Purge none humours but malignaunte to nature. sicontra, difficulter, that is, if soche thinges be pourged as ought to be, it pro¦fiteth, and may easely be suffered, but if it be contrariwyse, it hurteth and may scarsely be borne, wherefore ther ought
diligent hede to be takē in the receiuing of a purgation, that it be ministred by a skilfull Phisicion, that hathe certainly founde out what humour it is that ha∣boundeth. But alas the greatest noum∣ber of the common people, doe holde an opinion that if they may haue a medi∣cine for a little money, whiche wil pro∣uoke them often to the stoole, what hu∣mour soeuer it pourgeth out, they are safe enough:One pour∣ging medicen do not expulse thabundaūce of eche humor howebeit, I would wishe thē hereafter alwayes to haue in minde this saiyng of the moste excellent, Phi∣sicion Hipocrates in the xxiij. Aphoris∣me of the first booke, Deiectionas non multitudine sunt estimande, sed fi talia deijciantur, qualia conueniunt, that is: egestions are not to be estemed for their great quantitie, but if soche humours be pourged out as ought to be (that is) soch vitious and corrupt humours as doe a∣bounde and be superfluous in mannes body. There be diuerse thinges to be cō¦sidered of a Phisition before he minister purgation, as the qualitie of the hu∣mour,
the strengthe of the sicke, the age, the time of the yeare, & the disease. The qualitie of the humoure is to be conside∣red, that he may knowe what kinde of humour is to be euacuate, and pourged out, for it must be onely that which trou∣bleth the bodie with superfluous aboū∣daunce thereof.Debumeribus ex Galeno & aliis. As if fleme doe abeunde and trouble the bodie, he must minister a medicen, whiche purgeth fleme, and so likewise for other humours abounding The minister of medicen ought to haue respecte to the strengthe of the sicke, for if he be very weak and feble, there oughte no purgation to be ministred vnto him,Whē to purge when not. because all purgations doe weaken na∣nure and diminishe strengthe, and the stronger they be, the more they weiken. Let all men therfore beware of vehemēt and strong purgatiōs, lest they put their life in hasarde and daunger. By the age of the patient, the Phisicion is put in minde that children and old men ought not to receiue purgations, except great necessitie require it. The tyme of the
yeare is not to be neglected, for there be sometimes of the yeare wherein purga∣tions ought not to bee ministred, as in Somer,What tyme purgyng is very petilous specially the Dogge daies, as they are commonly called, during the time that the Sunne is in Leo, for then is nature burnt vp & made weake, y• she is not able to suffer the force & violēce of a purgation, but the Spring time is moste apte for purgations, because it is temperate. Last of al, ye Phisicion ought diligently to beholde and contemplate the disease, that he knowing what kind of disease it is, may the better finde out of what humour it is caused. As for ex∣ample,To a tercian the cause. if the Phisicion perceiue the di∣sease to be a tertian feuer, straightway he knoweth that it is caused of aboun∣daunce of choler, and therefore he must minister a medicine to pourge choler, & so foorth in other diseases. Note, that it there be none of the im∣pedimentes aboue named, a purgation is good to bee ministred to all soche as haue aboundaunce of euill iuyce or cor∣rupt
humours in y• bodie, for it draweth out the humours that dothe moleste, and thereby restoreth the bodie to his natu∣rall estate again. But if a purgation be rashely ministred, either to one that ne∣deth it not, or at an vnmete time, or that it be soch a medicine as draweth not out the humour whiche then aboundeth,Medicines moste apt to the paciente. or if the medicine bee vehement and very strong, it will surely put the pacient in daunger of his life. These thinges ther∣fore ought to be well taken hede of by al men, lest they catche great hurte, when they hope for some profite. But if a pur∣gation bee ministred discretely to hym that hath nede of it in due time, & by an apte medicine, whiche is able to drawe out the abounding humour in sufficient quantitie, then dooeth the medicine sin∣gulare commodities to the bodie, for it euacuateth and emptieth out al the cau∣ses of diseases and sicknesses, either pre∣sent or to come, being engendred of any superfluous or corrupt humour, as bee feuers, tertians, quartains, quotidians,
fluxes caused of rawe humours or sharp choler, Dropsies, Goutes, Palsies, Li∣targies,Preparai∣tiue before purgacion. and diuerse other. Note that be∣fore a purgatiō be ministred, ther ought a medicine to be taken, whiche shoulde prepare the body & make it apt to purge, and therfore it is called a preparatiue, it is geuen for two caused, either to deuide extenuate, and make theim grosse and clammy humours, that they may be re∣die to Aowe out, whē the medicine dra∣weth them, or els it is geuen to open & vnstoppe the cōduites and vessels of the body, by which ye purgation must drawe the superfluous humour to it. And this is that whiche Hipocrates doth counsail in the first Aphorisme of his secōd booke where he saith, Corpora cum quis{que} pur¦gare voluerit, oportet fluuia facere, that is, when any man wil pourge the body, he must make it flowing by opening & vnopening the vessels.Purge in the Mornyng. The moste mete time to receiue a purgation, is the mor∣ning, for then are all the digestions per∣fectly finished, and the stomake is with∣out
meate, there is heede to be taken, in what signe the Moone is before a purga∣tion be ministred, for some signes ar good for it, and some are euill, whiche are de∣clared in the table before, so that if any man desire to knowe a mete time for to pourge, there he may learne it. A pur∣gation must be taken hote, for so it offen¦deth the stomack lesse, and it wil worke the soner. Those that be apte to vomite, and are offended with the smell of the purgation,How to be∣haue the bo∣dy in the time of purgyng. let thē stoppe their nosethril∣les or smell some odoriferous thing in taking of it. As soone as it is taken it is good to smell to a toste of browne bread dipped in vineger, & applie warme clo∣thes to the stomake, and to washe the mouthe straighte after it is taken with odoriferous wyne, or to chewe sweete & pleasaunt things to take away the hor∣rible taste of y• medicine, by this meanes vomiting shalbe eschewed. For i. hou∣res space after the purgation is taken, let the pacient sit still and keepe himselfe the quiet and without sleepe, that the
strengthe of the medicine may passe to all partes of the body, if the purgation worke slowely, lette him walke vp and downe a good pace if he can. When it worketh, in any case there must be hede taken that the pacient doe not slepe, for so the operation of the medicine woulde be stopped. Also in the time of pourging, immoderate heate and colde are to bee eschued, and therefore a very great fier, and the colde and open aire are bothe hurtfull, for the bodie must be kept in a temperate heate.What one should do af∣ter purging. After that the purga∣tion is taken, except the stomake be very weake, it is beste not to eate any thing, lest the operation of the medicine should be hindred. After that the purgaciō hath doen working, the pacient must be nou∣rished with a meane quantitie of some broth that will breede good iuice, and be easely digested, and after by little and lit¦tle, returne to his accustomed diet. Thus haue I as briefly as I coulde, declared the commodities of bloud let∣ting and pourging, being wel and due∣ly
ministred and vsed, and the discōmo∣dities that will ensue of thē both if they be at any time misused, wishing al men as they tender their healthe and life, to beware of those ignoraūt persones that vse to open but one kinde of vaine for al diseases,One medicin helpeth not euery sicknes & occupie but one kinde of pur∣gation against all humours, not consi∣dering at all, the time, the strengthe, and age of the patient, nor the cause of the di∣sease, nor any other of the circumstaun∣ces afore named, but let theim seke for the counsaile and aide of one that is skilfull in phisike, and circū∣spectt in his doinges. Who can consider what neede they haue, and what is moste mete to be ministred vnto theim. ∴
Here followeth a Table whiche teacheth to knowe in what signe the Moone is for euer. FYrst, you must know what is Prime or golden number, and with it you must woorke after this sorte, seeke in the calender the daie of the moneth, and beginne at the nomber right against it, and tell so many dounwarde as you haue daies in your minde, then marke that noumber you finde there.The Prime. And seke the Prime of that yeare, and beginne at the noumber that is against it, and tel so many doun∣ward as the nomber was that you mar∣ked before; & where that endeth, against it you shall finde the signe in the whiche the Moone is that daye: as for example. The golden nombre this present yeare of our Lorde. 1564. is 7. that I keepe in minde all the yeare. Nowe if I desire to knowe in what signe the Moone is the first daye of Maye, I seke May in the table, and against it I finde the nomber
of 8. And because it is the first daie of the moneth, I tell no further, with that 8. in my minde, I seeke the Prime whiche is 7. and against it is 14. whiche I meddle not withall, but there I beginne and tel dounwarde vntill I haue tolde 8. which was in my mynde before,To knowe the Prime. and there is 21. against which is writtē Capricorne. And therefore I knowe that on the first daye of May the Moone is in Capricorn. Lykewyse if you wyll knowe in what signe the Moone is the 20. daye of Au∣gust this present yeare, seeke August, & against it you shall finde 18. where you must beginne to tell dounwarde to the ende. And then from the toppe doune∣warde againe vntill you haue tolde 20. and so you shall finde there 10. whiche beare in minde. Then goe to 7. the gol∣den nomber, and beginning at 14. that is against it, tell dounwarde 10. where you shall finde 23. against whiche you shall finde Aquarius, and therefore bee sure, that the twenty daye of August the Moone is in Aquarius. But in the yeare
of our Lorde. 1565. wherein the goldē nomber is 8. worke likewise, and you shall finde, that the Moone is in the last ende of Gemini. And in the yeare of our Lorde. 1566. The Prime being 9. you shall finde by like operation the Moone to be in the first part of Scorpio thesame daye. So that this rule is perpetuall, & certaine, so that you marke wel the gol∣den noumber of the yeare that you seke for, and then worke accordingly as is a∣boue taught, for by the fourmer exam∣ples you may with little studie bee able to seke out in what signe the Moone is, or was, or shalbe, any daie of any yeare present, past or to come, so that you knowe what is the Prime or golden nom∣ber of that yere that you séeke.

By this former table, after you haue founde out in what signe the Moone is in,When to sow plante. &c. you may knowe by the three rowes that followe the signes, what tyme is good to let bloud, to pourge, and to sette sowe or plāte, according as the titles on their heades doe declare, so that if you finde in what signe the Moone is, and do finde this letter G against it, looke what rowe it is in, for if it be vnder the title to let bloud, that is a good day to let bloud in: If vnder the title of pourging, it is good to purge, if vnder the last stile, it is good to plante, prouiding if you maye, that the Moone be in the encrease, (that is) as long as she is betwene the chasīge past, and the ful to come. And where there be not written any let∣ters, those daies ar either euill or but indiffe∣rent for that purpose. (.?.)
By this fi∣gure you may knowe what is the golden nom∣ber for euer, markyng di∣ligently that. 7. is Golden nomber the yeare of our Lorde. 1564. THis figure of the golden nombre is necessarie for the table, wherin is taught to knowe in what signe the Moone is in. For by this figure you may knowe what is, hath been, & shall be golden nomber for euer. As for exam¦ple, if you would know what was gol∣den
nomber the yeare of our Lord 1560. Then because you see that in the yere of our Lord. 1564. the Prime is 7. marke howe many yeares be betwene. 1560. & 1564. and you shall finde 4. therfore be∣cause it is for yeares past, beginne at 7. & tel 4. backwards towards ye left hād, & there you shall finde 3. which was prime the yere 1560. And if you will looke for 7. yeres before this presēt yere, you shall finde y• prime was. 19. But if you would knowe for any yere to come, recken frō 7. towards the right hande, & so shal you finde it, that as 7. is prime for the yere of our Lorde 1564. so is 8. prime for 1565 and 9. for 1566. & so forthe perpetually. You shall also finde in the beginning of this booke a Calender, wherein is de∣clared, the rising and going doune of the sunne, and the length of the daie & night with the prime, and Dominicall, and sainctes daies, very necessary for all kinde of men, and very plain and easie to vnderstāde.
