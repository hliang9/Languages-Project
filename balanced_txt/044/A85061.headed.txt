A further and more true Account of the Apprehending and Taking, of Gerard Dremelius the Drawer, For the Murther of Oliver Norris Esquire, At the White-Gross Tavern in East Smith field, his Examination, and Confession, together with the Exa∣mination of Micheal Van Burgh, and Catherin Truet before the Coroners Inquest, and their Commit∣ment to Newgate on Saturday last: As also a further, and more particular Account of the said barba∣rous Murther. GERARD DREMELIUS, the Dutch Mans Drawer, who was chiefly concern'd in the Murther of Oliver Norris Ess{que} at the White-Cross Tavern in East Smith-field was Discover'd and Taken after this manner, viz. the Constables and other Officers of the Parish where the Murther was Committed; having Intelligence, that he carried a Hamper out very early the next Morning, and that he went towards St. Catherins with it, they by making Enquire, along the Water side, fortunately found out the Water Man that carried him up the the River about 5 of the Clock, that Morning who inform'd them, that he carried his Hamper to Mr. Taylors at the Crown in Charles street by St. James's Square; where being come by the Water∣man's direction, they found that one of the Lord Shoots Foot-Men had fetched the said Hamper away, by the said Drawer's order, upon which sending to the Lord Shoots (who is Ambassador from the Duke of Zell) for the said Foot Man; he told them that the Drawer being his Country Man, and well known in his Lords Family, he had taken a Lodging for him at Mr. Comins at the Cock and Bottle in the same street, where he left him: But Mr. Comins, would not consent to entertain him, till he had farther enquired of him at the Lord Shoots House in St. James's Square, where the Servants gave him a favourable Character: Whereupon going thither; they found him up two pare of Staires upon the Bed about 8 in the Evening, where he was Appre∣hended and taken (and not at the Crown by St. James's Square, as was falsely given out) when being charged with the said Murther, he at first utterly deny'd it, alledging he did not forstand them but being taken thence that Night, and the next Day being Saturday, he was carried before the Worshipful Justice Bateman, in Well Colss, where the Hamper being opened, they  all bloody, at which time being Examin'd he Cnfessed that he Murtered him, and being asked why? be alledged that the Gentleman drew his Sword against him, where upon in his defence (as he says) he Knock'd him Down; and having got that advantage, it suddaidly came in his mind to Murther him for his Money, which he  perform'd by dragging him to a Dichs side behind the old Buildings near his Masters House, where he cat his Throat with a sharp Knife of his own, and having Robb'd and Strip'd him, he threw his naked Body into the Ditch, or Common Shore, which was deep of Water and Mudd, laying a consideble quanty f Dirt and Rubbish on him, and having covered the Blood as well as he could, went to his Masters House, and asked his pretended Mistress for a Hamper, who seeing his Hands bloody, asked him how they came so, he answered, he beleived he had kill'd the Gentleman; so she fetch'd him the Hamper, a sent him go▪idg. This being his real Confession, and no other, Notwithstanding the flying Reports and Pamphlets, to the contrary, However the Maid being Examin'd, declared that, when she asked her at first about the Hamper, she said it was lent to a Sugar-Baker, but before the Justice and Corner, Confssd the Drawer had it, and being found in several other contrary Tale, the Justice ordered them to be had before the Gor∣oners Inquest, where the same matters was again repeated, without any or very little Variation, where∣upon Mr. George Rives Coroner, Committed Gerard Dremeus the Drawer, together with Van Burgh and his pretended Wife to Newgate, where the two former are very much loaded with Irons, in order to be Try'd for the said Murther the next approaching Sessions, but the Maid is to be Discharged upon Bail. On Thursday last being the 13th of June 1700, Mr. Noris a Coet of Horie, belonging to the Kings-Guards, having occasion to go to Epping upon some weighty Business, his Father enjoying a very great Estate in those parts, took House in order for his Journey that Morning but unfortunately (as I may so terme it) he met with some Gentlemen of his acquaintange, who being something longer than ordinary in taking their Leaves of him; he was so much disordered in Drink as rendered him uncapable of going his Journey, having Drunk variety of Liquors in St. Catherins, that where leaving his Friends, he secretly with drew himself, and sent his Horse; by a Porter to the Bull-Head in White-Chappel, and at the same time took Coach, and came about 10 a Clock that Night to the White-Cross Tavern in East Smith-Field, the Master of which, being one Van Burgh a Dutch-Man, where he continued till after 11 a Clock, being seen there by several of the Neighbours, but was e
more heard of till next Morning about Seven, at which time was found by a strong Water Man, in a Maudlins Rents very near the said Dutch House, strip'd stark naked and Murthered in a cruel and inhuman manner, having his Throat cut from Ear to Ear, in such a savage and abominable manner as scarcely ever was known or heard of, for not only his Wind-pipe and all his Throat was cut cross, but the ve∣joints of his Neck Bones almost cut asunder, with a cruel bruise on the left side of his Head; and not only so but all his Fingers on his right Hand cut overthwart, supposed to be done by his laying hold of the Knife, which prov'd the tragical in∣strument of his Death, he likewise was barbarously hack'd, and mangled on the left Hand and Arm, being Robb'd of all his Cloathes, and a considerable qua∣nity of Gold and Silver, which his Friends has since afirm'd he had about him over Night, some says 100 Guineas besides a rich Watch, and other things of great vallue; having nothing on him but, a pair of Boots, and scarlet Stockings, which tis supposed, his Murtherers could not get off with such speed as they desired. The newes of this barbarous Cruelty being nois'd about, abundance of People came crowding from all parts of London to see this Murthered Object, upon which it appearing by several that he was late the Night before at the Dutch Mans House which was near that place; he and his Wife were taken into Custody on suspition and carried before the Worshipful Justice Constable in Goodman-Fields, where they were strickly Examined, as was also his Maid, who all Confessed that the deceased Gentleman was drinking in his House from 10 of the Clock that Night till after 11 and that Van Burgh offered his Man to conduct him to his Lodging, but he refusing it they alledged that a stranger coming by accidentuly, the Gentleman agreed with him for 6 pence to go with him to his Lodging, and that they did not seem him any more till Dead the next Morning among the crowd of People; but the Justice asking where the Drawer was, his Wife reply'd, they had sent him to fetch some Wine from a certaine place which she named, whereupon a Messinger being sent thither to know the truth, soon brought word that he had not been there, which made their Case the more Suspitious, after which the Maid declared that she saw the same Gentleman, about 10 of the Clock Drinking below Stairs with the Drawer at which time her Master and Mistrirs caused her to go to Bed contrary to her usual custom, for other Nights she us'd to sit up latest in the House but that Night she was forced to Bed in all the hast, and further declared that when in her Chamber she heard a strange bustling Noise below insomuch that she was coming down to see what was the matter, but was met by her Mistress, who told her all was well, and so she went into her Chamber again and so to Bed, but knew nothing further, only saw her Mistress fetch down the Hamper, in great hast towards the Morning, when asking her af∣terwards what was becom'd of it, her answer was, she had lent it to a Sugar-Baker, tho some hours after she told her who had it, desiring her not to speak of it, alleding her Life was in her Hand; so that altho the Drawer doth yet seem to take Fact wholy upon himself, yet there is great cause to suspect both her, and her pretended Husbands Innocency. Upon further search of his Body after he was carried in a Coffin to the Constables House, several wounds were found in divers parts of his Body, being used after such a Loathsome and Inhuman manner, that the most Savage, Barbarous, and worst of Infidels would be ashamed of. Twas observed among other discourse which the Dutch Man express'd, during his being in the Constables Custody tis said he told them that it was their way in Holland when any Person was Murthered by a Confederacy they always sent the Murtherer out of the way, the very instant after he had committed it, while the other took care to hide the Murthered Body, and by that means they usually escaped unpunished; and if so this was one of his own Countrey Tricks, but tis thought he will meet with contrary success here.
