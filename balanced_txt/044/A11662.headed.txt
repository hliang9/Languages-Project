ACT ANENT THE out comming of Horses, as well conforme to their rents as Voluntiers. AT EDINBVRGH, the last day of Iune 1640. years: These of the Committee appointed by the Estates of Parliament, taking to consideration how the instructi∣ons for putting out of Horses may be best effectuate, conforme to the Generall order: Hath ap∣pointed and ordained, that every man, as well to Burgh as Land∣wart, shall send out a sufficient and able Horse and man armed, with Jack, and Lance, or with Pi∣stols, Carobine; and that according to two thousand markes of rent, conforme to the valuations, which shall be the rule of the Mustars. And siklike, It is appointed, That every Heritour and Tennent shall put out their best and most fitting Horse for that use: Neither shall any man whatsoever, bee suffered to keepe any good and able fit Horses for the Troup at home, but must either send him out as one of their proportion for their rent; Or otherwise come presently out up∣on them themselves, or some other friend, as Voluntiers, or other∣wise sell them at a reasonable rate for the use of the Countrey. And because Barrons, and Gentle-men of good sort, are the greatest and most powerfull part of the Kingdome, by whose valour the King∣dome hath ever beene defended: Wee doe most earnestly require and expect, that every Barron and Gentle-man of good sort, shall come to the Armie in their owne persons, or at least send their ablest son, brother, or friend. And that all Noble-men, Gentle-men, and others, may bee the better encouraged to come out as Voluntiers in so good a Cause, for maintenance of Religion, and preservation of the Liber∣ties of this ancient and never conquered Kingdome, which wee are all sworne to maintaine. It is earnestly desired, That all brave Cave∣liers will take the businesse to heart, and consider that now or never is the time to gaine Honour, and Eternall reputation, and to save or losse their Countrie. Like as, It is heereby declared, That who shall so come out as Voluntiers (havng put out their proportions in good and able Horses as said is) Shal have libertie to serve upon their owne best Horses themselves as Voluntiers, and shall have corne to their Horses out of the common Magazine, and good quarters for themselves; And shall not bee put to toilesome watching, or any o∣ther troublesome duetie: So that it is hereby declared, that no good Horses shall bee suffered to stay at home upon any kinde of pretext whatsoever; With certification that these who shall faile in any of the premisses, shall not only be censured, as the Committee of E∣states shall appoint, but will also bee repute and holden as Loytterers, or averse from the good Cause.
