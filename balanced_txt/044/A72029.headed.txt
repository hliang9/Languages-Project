To al that affect the famous exercise of ARCHERIE frequenting Finsburie fieldes. SHooting in the long bow being of it selfe very laudable, and our En∣glish nation in all ages surpassing therein all others, yea neither the Ge∣tes, Seythes, Parthians, Sarmathians, Armiaspes famous for that quality, nor any other people could become equall with English Archers. And yet (a mat∣ter to be lamented) this laudable exer∣cise of late dayes hath become cold in most places of this land, famous Londō retaining the most ardēt desire to main∣taine the same, as appeareth by the daily concourse of Citizens, to their great commendations, in diuerse companies in the conuenient fields about the citie, but most especially in that choise place Fins∣burie,
most especially garnished with many beautifull Markes in this little Treatise Alphabetically mentioned, whereby the benefactors therein shall haue perpetuall memorie recorded by the titles of their seuerall erections. And for that euery hand ought to bring some portion of helpe towards the preseruation and increase of so commen∣dable actiuitie, we haue (by the helpe of our friends) cast in also our mite, wishing it to worke a continuing in the old, and a growing goodwill in such yong beginners as would become skilfull in this most acceptable qualitie, for whose sakes this litle worke is reuiewed, reuiued and re∣published, with such necessary, easie, and helpfull obseruations as may seeme best to satisfie those that are desirous to come to knowledge in the Markes.
Rules touching the vse of the Treatise. 1 First, you must note, that sun∣drie Markes haue two or three wordes for their names, looke for the marke alwaies in the first word, as in the Kings Mace, looke not for Mace but for Kings: also the House of Lancaster, looke for House not for Lancaster, and so in the rest. 2 And it is further to be noted, that the first number sheweth the scores, the second the yards: you must shoote long ayme, because this is set downe by mea∣sure of the line 3 Againe you must note, that wee haue set downe the markes to be taken all going into the fields, and if you be coming homeward, looke for the marke you shoote at, and not for the marke you stand at. And we haue placed from
euery marke all the marks from the left hand to the right, leauing out none from 9. score to 18. or 19. score. And when a marke is found along a banke, you must alwayes looke for the marke from the West towards the East. 4 Also for the aide of yong shooters wee: haue set downe in the ende of the booke a Table of the names of all the marks, with direction in what page to find them, for the ease of those that are vnacquainted with the names of the markes. For the better aduertisement of such as are not acquainted with the order of the game and custome of the field, wher∣by often arise controuersies, and diuerse times grow rash and vnaduised othes, to the derogation of Gods glory, we haue thought it good to set downe such orders as are sittest to be obserued in this ex∣ercise.
1 First for the finding of your marke, it must be within euery mans reach. Al∣so the precise naming of your marke preuenteth much cauill. 2 Secondly, for whites you may haue as many as you will, so they be all for∣wards, and if you shoote at anie loose white, and it be striken out of sight, it is no marke. 3 Thirdly, for the highest of stakes, if the wood be aboue the pin, you are to measure at the wood, although the pin hath bene put in for the same purpose. 4 Fourthly, if you finde a bush or a blacke, whatsoeuer you finde highest in it, being within the compasse of the marke, you are to take it for the height. 5 Fiftly, for all trees you are to mea∣sure at foote and pole, except in the na∣ming of it you say, at the naile in such a tree, or hole in such a tree, or being a tree of so small height, that you may
reach the top of it with halfe your bowe, then you may take the highest. 6 Sixtly, if there be so nigh a shoote that it cannot be giuen by the contrarie side, or by another companie, then the better of them two is to win the shoote at the next marke, and not to let it lye dead to the aduantage of the contrarie side. If in measuring of the shoote, by haste the marke is stirred, he is to lose the shoote that measureth it. 7 Seuenthly, when you come to the marke and claime two, and the contrary sides draw their arrowes, & when your mate comes he saith his would win too, you are to win no more then you claime. 8 Lastly, if you name one marke and shoote at another, you are to lose your shoot, and they are to follow at the mark named.
