¶ A lytell treatyse agaynst sedicyous persons. ¶ To trolle awaye or trolle in / let not trolle spare If trolle truly trolle / trolle nedeth not to care. OF late I perused / two purposes seuerall In their kyndes clerkely handeled / the truth for to tell Trolle awaye and Trolle in / men do them call Treatyng vpon mater / concernyng the late Crumwell The one vtterly myndyng / the other to repell Trolle away (the trouth is) moche touched the quycke And Trolle in (somwhat galled) began for to kycke. ¶ yet Trolle away tolde trouth / it can not be denyed Declaryng the offence / wherin Crumwell offended Trolle in beyng troubled / whan he it espyed With trollynges to couer it / full subtelly contended Some trollers there be / I wolde were amended For who that craftely couereth / any others offence Of lykelyhode / in his owne herte / hath the same pretence. ☞ Truly to trolle / it is no maner of shame And trollyng vntrue / is not to be mayntayned As euery thyng is / so to gyue it propre name Amonges all true honest men / shulde not be disdayned The scripture so techeth vs / it can not be fayned Agaynst scripture who stryueth / he is none other lyke Than a traytoure to his prince / and to god an heretyke,Ve qui di∣citis bonū malum et malum bo¦num. Esa. quinto. ❧ I entende not to trolle / to take any parte Diuisyon to encreace / it nedeth nothyng But sorowfully syghyng / I trolle in my harte With my selfe in mynde / many tymes reuoluyng How god to vs / hath ordayned the most noble kyng Who vniformly to knyt vs / hath traueyled full sore Yet many trifelyng trollers / care lytell therfore. ¶ But as trollers troubelous and full of enuy At the lawes of god / and of our good kyng In their trollynges do trust / yet that their olde heresy All good ordrys set a parte / shall florisshe and sprynge Their prechers / no lesse conforte / in their sermons do brynge Euen lately exhortyng them / auoydyng all drede And persecution not regardyng / throughly to procede. ¶ With many wordes more troublous / than now I wyll reherce Not doutyng at all / but at length they shalbe knowen Suche trollyng trecherous / my herte doth sore perce Consyderyng howe sedicyously / amonges vs they besowen Of late I well trusted / they had ben ouer blowen But now I well parceyue / that neither fauour nor smarte From the body can expell / that is rooted in the harte. ¶ A trewe trollyng hert / wolde be loth to pretende Any purpose to mayntayne / agaynst god or his kyng The confessyon of an heretyke / that lately dyd offende And amonges others / suffred for his deseruyng Secretly they embrace / as a most precyous thyng And yet playnly wyll I proue / by good lawe and reason Contayned therin / both heresy and treason.
❧ In any wyse imprynted / they wyll not it shall be The daungers therof in themselues mystrustynge Wherfore euery man may well perceyue and se What hertes they do beare to god and our good kynge Euery of them secretly must haue it in wrytynge But Chryst sayeth verely there is ndthynge conceled But at length shalbe knowen / and openly reueled. Nihil est opertum quoq non reueletur. ne{que} occul∣tum {quod} nō sciatur. Math, x, ¶ Who against them trolleth / a Papyst they him name They haue no other thing / themselues for to defende I wolde that all Papystes / had an open shame And that all heretykes / them selues wold amende Than shuld we haue no cause / further to contende But vniformly to lyue / the one with the other And ioyfully to enhabyt / as brother with brother. Ecce {quam} bo∣nū et {quam} io∣cūdū habi∣tare fratres in unum. psa, c, xxxij ☞ Such shuld be our trollynges / Christ vs so teacheth Commaunding euer peace / amonges vs for to be Mathei. x. Luce. ij. Io, xiiij. xv, Vntruly he trolleth / that otherwyse preacheth Styreng to any sedicion / malyce or enuye Where banisshed is discorde / and raygneth all charite That realme in god resteth / and god is in it / Being charite him selfe / as sayth the holy writ. De{us} chari∣tas est & {qui} manet ī ca∣ritate ī deo manet et deus in eo i. Ioha. iij. ☞ Than towardes that charite / trolle we on a pace Auauncyng our selues / with all conuenyent spede Amore acceptable pilgrimage / surely neuer was For which god gaue to man / any meryte or mede Our labour or gret burden / let vs nothing drede Nor regarding the wylfulnes / of our body or flesshe For at the iorneyes ende / Christ wyll vs refresshe. Venite ad me oēs qui laboratis & onorati e∣stis, et ego reficiā uos Mathei. xv ❧ And than as true trollers / togither let vs remayne Parfectly fast knyt / in one peace / vnyte and loue With glory vnto god / euermore glad and fayne Our noble Prince truly to serue / as doth vs behoue oīs aīa po sub. subdi∣ta sit. ro, 13. And all others to tendre / as duty doth vs moue Vsyng styll amonge vs / the selfe same loue and concorde Which is to vs commaunded / by Christ the eternall lorde. Hoc est mā¦datū meū ut diligatis īuicē sicut Ioh. xv. ❧ And nowe in that loue / let vs all with one voyce pray For the preseruacion of Henry our most noble kyng And Katheren our Quene / that they togither may Prosperously contynue / to their hertes desyring And Edward our Prince / that most angelyke thing That they all togither may longe lyue and rest And after with him to raygne / qui in celis est.
