An Item to His MAIESTIE Concerning PRINCE RVPERT And his CAVALIERS. OR, A Looking-Glasse, wherein His Majesty may see his NEPHEWS Love; Who secretly under pretence of Assisting Him, to gain an absolute Prerogative or Arbitrary Power, will disthrone Him to set up himselfe. Written by a Welwisher to His MAjESTY. Feb: 3 PRINTED, In the year of the KING of Kings. 1642.
An Item to His MAIESTIE Concerning Prince RUPERT, and his CAVALIERS. WHilest His Majesty is forcing a way through Laws and Parliaments, by seeking to eradicate the one, and overthrow the just priviledges of the other, to gain an absolute Prerogative, and establish Ar∣bitrary power, by which he and his posterity is disestee∣med, and His loving and loyall Subjects may be ensla∣ved, he plainly runs the hazard of a double destruction, and ruine to Himselfe and Posterity. The one is by endeavouring to abolish the ancient Fundamentall Constitutions of this Kingdom, establi∣shed upon Laws and Parliaments, Himselfe being the top Bough and highest Branch, which must needs there∣fore have the greatest fall, if this long flourishing Tree be digged up by the roote. And here I pray, His Maje∣stie would deliberately Consider; 1. That the Root and Body may flourish, when as the top Branch being nipt
with evill blasts, may be deprived of the sap that may remain in the Root and Body, and so may fall, or if not fall, it may be cut off as being not fit to remain thereon, lest it bring destruction to the rest being so infected with the blasts of evill Counsell. Farre be it from me to de∣sire it, the Lord grant it may bee prevented, lest this Breach from the Root and Body be not of worser conse∣quence in a civill respect, than the cutting off of the Jews, by reason of their unbeliefe in a spirituall; who though they were broken off, yet may at last be grafted in againe; and if the Lawes and Parliaments bee the Root which His Majesty hath confessed in His Coro∣nation Oath, in putting Himselfe to be guided by them; then let Him consider that He beareth not the Root, but the Root him, and though He be the Head as is confe∣ssed, yet if it be seperated from the body, it cannot long have life. But Secondly, Be pleased to consider, That the Laws and Parliaments are as properly the peoples, if not more, yet of greater concernment than either the Land-markes or Naboths Vineyard, the one of which being removed, the other taken away, did not only bring a heavy curse, but also layd a sad foundation of a ruine both to a King and his Posterity, 1 Kings 21. And truly the King of kings, the God of Justice Will do justly; regarding in this respect the persons not of any, but hath provided Tophet of old, for Kings as well as beggars if they offend
him. Therefore, deare Soveraign (for whom my soul bleedeth) be pleased to take the kingly Prophets advice, Be wise now therefore oh ye Kings, be instructed ye Iudges of the earth; Serve the Lord with feare, and rejoyce with trembling, Kisse the Sonne lest he be angry, and ye perish in the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little, Blessed are all they that trust in him. And remember the Honor of a King consists in a multitude of people; but where will that honor bee if the sword continue to devour; but it may be the ground of all this before will not be so easily believed, because His Majesty may perswade Himselfe, that either by the Transportation of Himself into another soyle, or by al∣tering the nature of that soyl, upon which and by which He most naturally standeth (that is by changing from Parliamentary, to Arbitrary) may cause Him to grow the better; but not only the Statists doth, but I hope ex∣perience may teach both His Majesty and us, That alte∣rations are dangerous, especially Fundamentall ones, both to King and people; and if neither may be be∣lieved, yet Scripture may, in which Rehobohams case stands Recorded; not onely for this, but also for his hearkning to ill Counsell, who may seeme to have grea∣ter colour for what he did, than those Kings which are onely so by compact, and are as really bound to their people, as the people to them, in the fulfilling of those Lawes agreed to by both; unlesse as King Iames sayd, They will cease to be Kings and turne Tyrants,
which I hope harbours not in your MAjESTIES breast; and if we should step lower, and look at reason, it assures us that no one mans will, though it were the same that Adam had in innocen∣cie, is so safe to govern by, as is the counsell of many, with the consent of all. The other danger His Majesty runs, is more close, and lesse dis∣cerned, lying hid under an open shew of friendship, and siding with Him against His supposed enemies, by His Nephew Prince Rupert, one of the Blood-Royall, and not so far from the Crown, but if once the course of Law and power of Parliaments be ex∣tinguished, he may bid as fair for it by the sword, as His Majesty, he having possessed himselfe of so much power already, under co∣lour of serving the King, and by his Germaine manner of plunde∣ring, and his active disposition in Military affairs, having wonne the hearts of so many thousand Souldiers of fortune and men of pray; he is already their Chieftain and Prince, and if hereafter the power be transferred from civill to Marshall, he is like enough to be their King, and if theirs, then the peoples, if once subdued; for the King having lost their hearts, and the Law having lost their force, he that hath the best sword, and is likeliest to do most mischief, will be sure to gain the greatest party, and subdue the most to his subjection. We may remember how it fared with the Romans, so soon as the Legions or Military power was too strong for the Senate, they chose the Emperor: when Law lost his force; the Emperor lost his right; so when Parliaments are o∣ver borne with Cavaliers, the King will be subject to every winde of violence, and they that now pretend to set Him above His Par∣liament, will then set themselves above him, and will retort upon Him the same language He now useth against the Parliament; for when as He shall plead the Law against violence, for His being rightfull King, it will be demanded of Him, what Written. Law He can produce to make Him King of England? if He make An∣swer, that the Fundamentall Laws put Him in that Office; it will again be told Him, That His own position is, that those Funda∣mentall Laws must be known Laws, explicit and written, else not
to be trusted or urged in Plea; and then if no Law make Him King, Conquest may without wrong to Him, prefer another to the Crown, who is no stranger in bloud, and much more deser∣ving by the sword, this whole War being managed by his skill▪ labour and industry; insomuch, as already if the King command one thing and he another, the Prince must be preferred before the King; witnesse Banbury, which was secured from plundering by the Kings own hand; but that was slighted, and the Town plun∣dered by Prince Rupert, vilifying the Kings Authority and Fide∣lity, making it a fault of His unexpertnesse; Saying, his Uncle knew not what belonged to War. This may be sufficient to de∣monstrate what he intends, but expressions newly vented may con∣firm, in which there was little civility, and lesse Loyalty; but what can be expected from schollers taught by such a Master, they coming to perform a peece of service for their Mr (and no doubt by his commands) that they might give him the earnest to assure him of the full possession of the whole kingdom; set upon Henley; who no sooner was entred within the Town, but they cryed out (as thinking it sure) God dam us, the Town is Prince Roberts, but they reckoned without their hoast, and it would be well for them they could misse of Damnation, which they so often desire, and may justly expect, especially desiring of it so near death, that it may be questioned whether they had time left to repent; as it hap∣pened with some of those that fell at that time, and I hope if they mend not their manners, their Master and the rest will be payd home in the same coyne; now how unfit both are to be taken to assist a King (in an unjust War against Loyall Subjects) who la∣bour to disthorne them and enslave the other, let the World judge; for he that dare already so far to take upon him, will doubt∣lesse when time serves, and then be but one throw for 3 King∣doms, will put home for all, and so turne Tables with His Ma∣jesty, putting Him and His to their Pensions, as himselfe now is and may be worse, and than it will be too late for the King to think His Parliament and those that adhere to them, His best sub∣jects, when the Sons of Serviah are too hard for Him; neither
will Prince Rupert want abbettors and sharers in this cursed design; for many of our young deboyced and Low-fortun'd Nobility and Gentry suting therein so naturally with this new Conqueror will make no bones to shoulder out their old King, to set up such an one, as shall make them for making him: As for those of the graver and more sober sort, some of which have been looked at as good Patriots of the Common-wealth, I admire they do not be∣thinke themselves, and get off betimes, and endeavour to helpe the Lord against the mighty; knowing this, what side soever pre∣vails, they may come sadly home in some case or other, though worse on Prince Ruperts part than the Parliament; witnesse the imprisonment of my Lord Savill and the Sheriffe of Yorke-shire, who now are imprisoned for this saying (& that upon just ground) The Papists bore the greatest sway in my Lord of Newcastles Ar∣my, and none suffered to bear offices but such; that they would not fight against Religion and their own conscience, whatsoever else may be pretended. And such a stratagem may be layd for them, when they may speak lesse matter according to their con∣science and judgement; as for the other which do hope for ad∣vancement by their Countries ruine, they may come to fall short, as Esops dogge, who snatching at a shadow lost the substance; and marvell not that I put these amongst those that will raise their Master P. R. for they that are not faithfull to their Countrey, can never be Loyall to their King, but as the winde blowes best for them, so they will sayle: But for the preventing of this, I be∣seech the Lord to open the eyes of His Majesty, that he duely and truly considering, what otherwise may come upon Him and His Dominions, may joyn Himselfe to His great Councell, that so He may flourish, and His Subjects may enjoy Peace and Truth. FINIS.
