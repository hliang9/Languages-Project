A Short Account of Sir Carbery Pryse's Lead-Work, given in the First of June, 1693. by William Waller, Steward there.   Lib. SIX hundred men employed at the great Vein till the Level be up, at 8 s. 6 d. per Tun, for getting, washing, and making Merchantable, as it is now got, every Two men must get above a Tun by Week to make them Wages; but at the rate of one Tun a Week, the 600 men will raise 300 Tuns by Week, and at 50 Weeks, 15000 Tuns by Year. This Charge of getting is   6375 Carriage to the River Dovey, at 5 s. per Tun   3750 12 d. by Tun by Water to the Port of Aberdovey; and for Landing it into Storehouses   750 15000 Tun of Oar will make 10000 Tun of Lead; Smelting of this when our Mills are up, at 15 s. per Tun   7500 Charges   18375 10000 Tun of Lead, at 9 l. per Tun   90000 Charge of getting, washing, carriage, and smelting, L. 18375 19500 Sinking Shaftes and incident Charges 1125 Clear Profit   70500 When the Level is brought up to the Great Vein, which will not cost above 500 Pounds, there may be employed 400 men more in that Vein. And the Level will serve the North Vein and the Two South Veins; and these Three Veins will be capable of receiving 400 men each; but in the North and Two South Veins it will cost us about 20 s. a Tun, getting and washing; but if they mend in sinking, as the great Vein doth, it may then be got at half the Price; neither do I know, till the Level be up, what more Veins may be discovered in that Ground, having not yet tried above 20 Yards in breadth, on each side the great Vein.
An Abstract of the PROPOSALS of Sir Carbery Pryse and his present Partners, concerning their Famous Lead-Mines called Bwlchireskirhir, in the County of Cardigan. SIR Carbery Pryse being seized of the Inheritance of the Lands where the said Mines are found, and the same being the largest Mines that were ever discovered in England, the Pattentees of Royal Mines pretended them to be Mines Royal, and sued for the same; but the said Sir Carbery Pryse and Partners being now quieted in the Possession of the said Mines by two Verdicts at the Exchequer Bar, found for them by Gen∣tlemen of great Quality both of Middlesex and Hartfordshire, and also by Their Majesties Special Order in granting them a Noli prosequi: And find∣ing that it is necessary to take in more Partners and Sharers in order to find a vend for the great product of the said Mines; for that by Experience it is found, that 600 men imployed in the great Vein alone will raise 15000 Tuns of Oar per Annum, which will yield in melting 10000 Tuns of Lead, which at 9 l. per Tun, comes to 90000 l. and the charge of digging it up, smelt∣ing it, and carrying it to the Port of Aberdovey, comes but to 19500 l. so that the Net Profit of that Vein only will be 70500 l. per Annum, if wrought to the best advantage, as by a just Computation thereof may appear. And the Profit of the Five other Veins already discovered, will also be very consi∣derable, if wrought to the best advantage; to find a vend for which great quantities will require great Assistance and help. Now for the Encourage∣ment of such Gentlemen as will make it their business to find a vend for the vast product of this Mine, The same is divided into 4008 Shares, 2004 whereof are exposed to sale: the Persons that now buy being to be let into profit from the first of this Instant, and to have a term of Two and twenty years and a half from that time. And to the end that many Persons may be concerned in the said Mines, which may conduce much towards finding a Vend for the said Product of the said Mines. It is Proposed, That within 12 days after 1200 Shares are transferred, there shall be a House taken, a general Meeting shall be summoned to chuse 12 Assistants for the Year ensuing, who with the Chairman, make a Com∣mittee, and have the management of the said Mines. The Assistants to be chose yearly. That General Meetings shall make Dividends, and shall be held once a Quarter, and oftner, if there be occasion; no Person to have a Vote in Ge∣neral Meetings unless he has Ten Shares, and each Person to have one Vote in General Meetings for every Ten Shares he has therein. That no Person shall be capable of being an Assistant, unless he has Twenty Shares or more in the said Mines. Note, That 4008 l. of the Money raised by sale of these Shares is to be paid in to the Cash keeper for a Quick Stock for carrying on the Work. London, July 31. 1693.
