DIRECTIONS BY WAY OF ALPHABET, READILY To find out the Principal HEADS or SUBJECTS contained in the Sacred BOOK CALLED DAVID'S PSALMS. TOGETHER With their respective Quotations, in order to the Holy Reading, or Singing of them, to the great Glory of GOD, and Edification of all PIOUS CHRISTIANS. Composed by a great Lover of all the Peo∣ple of God in England. LONDON, Printed in the Year 1674.
A Part of Pious and Lear∣ned Mr. ROƲS his Preface, before his Version of the Psalms into Meeter, so far as sets forth the most excel∣lent Use of them. THe Experience of Saints, if it should speak what it hath found, it would with an united Voice yield an abundant Testimony of the manifold uses of the Psalms: It would say, that they have in them Instruction to increase Knowledge, Spiritual Fervour, to inflame Zeal, Consolation, to Refresh, and Re∣vive Fainting Souls, Petitions to fetch Bles∣sings from God, Praises, as thankful Returns to God for his Blessings: Yea, it hath found in them, that Afflictions themselves do yield Con∣solation;
because, though deep Afflictions over∣whelm excellent Saints, yet even when they are Saints amidst such Afflictions, it finds yet farther, that Afflictions of Saints generally end in Consolations. The same Psalms beginning, as Jonas his Prayer, in the Belly of Hell, and ending in Heaven: For the Souls of the Saints, being stirred up by sharp Afflictions, to be earnest with God, in Mournful, yet Melodious Sup∣plications; God thus earnestly Invoked, turns in unto the Soul, and His Presence makes Heaven, even where an Hell was before: And then according to the Benefit, raiseth the Thanksgiviving, and the Soul mounts up to a heighth of Praises, as it self was mount∣ed up from the depth of Grief, to a heighth of Deliverance, Joy, and Consolation. Briefly, Experience will say, that the Psalms are Characters, and Representations of the Thought, Meditatoon, and Affection of a Sanctified Soul, throughout all the chan∣ges of her Pilgrimage: So that a good man can be in no kind of State, but he shall find his own State in a Psalm; and withal, find Thoughts, and Expressions sutable to that State, which may improve, and make it good unto him. And as the Psalms have their real and inward Excellencies; so being outwardly fit∣ted
to Measures, and by Measures to Sing∣ing: the Singing carries a delight with it, the delight invites to a more frequent use, and the frequent use increaseth the Profit of them; yea the same delight, and use fasteneth them more pleasantly, and strongly upon the Memo∣ry, and being remembred, they are thereby still at hand, and ready for more use, and so for more Profit.
The Authors Epistolatory Preface to his Following Collections and Applications upon the PSALMS. Dearly Beloved, THE Reasons inducing me to this work, were, first, the Holy Ʋse and Benefit of the Reading and Singing of the Sacred Songs, commonly Called, David's Psalms. The Super-Excellency of which I desire the Reader to view, in the first of Pious and Lear∣ned Mr. Rous his Preface, before annexed to his Version of them into Meeter. (The best ex∣tant, witness the Honourable, and Venerable Attestation prefixt in its Commendation.) Secondly, To allay the Difficulty, and lessen the Expence of time to all Persons, Families, and Congregations. Especially the Women and Children, and to others that are unlearned; as to the ready finding out upon any Holy Subject they desire to Read, or Sing of a proper Psalm, or Portion. Thirdly, That I might offer a Help to Mi∣nisters and Clerks, to readily chuse out fit Seg∣ments out of the Psalms, agreable to their Texts, to be sung before or after their Sermons. Fourthly, That I might humbly offer, I hope (through God's Assistance) the right sence of
Mystical and dark Texts, in that Book; by my brief Notes and Applications of them to some of the Respective Heads in this Work. In the next place, I desire my Reader to take this Reason for my adding sometimes the whole Psalm, or more, or fewer Verses thereof be∣fore or after the Verses Cited, as to the Head sought for (viz. that it was to make the Seg∣ment, or Portion to be read or sung, large e∣nough, and fit for the present Exercise, many Subjects, in their respective Psalms, being only mentioned in one or two Verses thereof; so that should I for enlargement of the Subject sought after, cited one, or more verses out of several other Psalms that treat thereof: It would have rendred the Duty and Work very tedious and troublesome in the Practice thereof: Onely I have been careful that all such supplements are fit and convenient to be joyned to, and read, or sung with the Subject enquired for. And as to the two principal Heads, God, and Jesus Christ, I have conceived it most for Edification, to place the great Attributes of God, and the chief Actings of our Savour, under their respective Heads. Lastly, I have Alphabetically contracted that Work into about Sixty four Heads, con∣taining most of the Doctrinal, Practical, and Prophetical Subjects in the Psalms. That so the Reader may more readily turn to
the matter he desires to Read or Sing; as under the Letter (G.) [God] the Letter (J.) [Jesus Christ] and so the rest of the Heads are to be speedily found out, together with their se∣veral Quotations in Figures; and made use of. More, was it necessary, I might have added, but for making this Collection too big to be bound up with, and placed after the singing Psalms, in Bibles of all sizes. My chief, and great design, in thus order∣ing and publishing this work, being first, the Glory of the onely true and Infinite One God. Secondly, the Edification in Grace, and Ho∣liness of you, my Dear Countrey-men of the Elect of God, in the English Nation; For whose Temporal, Spiritual, and Eternal Sal∣vation He constantly, and fervently Prays, who is Your Faithful Servant in Jesus Christ. Dated from my Study the 9th. of October, 1673.
