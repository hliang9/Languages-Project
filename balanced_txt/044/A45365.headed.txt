The PREFACE. DEar Friends unto whose hands this may come, this is to signifie of the Decease of our dear Friend Loveday Hambly, who hath finished her Course in this World and is gone to her long home, where the wicked cease from troubling: and if in former time such Women as feared God were esteemed honourable, and record∣ed to Posterity for their Vertue and good Works, may not this Friend of ours be recorded amongst the Living at this day whom the Living God raised up and made an Instrument in his hand to be serviceable in doing much good; who was a Wo∣man of a noble universal Spirit, and descended of honourable Parentage as amongst Men: Her fame, no doubt, is already gon far, especially amongst God's People, though many never knew her, or saw her Personally, to whom the following Account may be of service, as well as to such as did know her, and be a means to stir up the Mind that's Pure in all to admire the Goodness of the Lord, & may be encouraged to serve and obey him in faithfulness in their Day and Time, that they may come to rest in Gods heavenly Kingdom for evermore, into which this faithful Friend is entred. I shall not need here much to enlarge concerning this my dear, loving and well beloved Friend, because the Matter is so fully and truly Stated in the following Relation and Testimonies, to which (much of it) I can truly Subscribe: for it was my Lot to be a Houshold Servant to her about two years, to look after her Af∣fairs, and might have been to her dying day for ought I know, if I had not been taken a Prisoner for the Testimony of Truth, and kept about eight years in Prison, at which she was troubled and disappointed also; for she did manifest much Love to me; yea, I may say, she was more like a Mother to me than a Mistriss: I was an Eye-Witness to much of her Tryals and Sufferings, in which she was very va∣liant and chearful: she had a great Family, and God gave her a great Measure of Wisdom to order it: her Tables were largely and plentifully spread, which is well known to many, and she took great care that all might have sufficient, and likewise that none of the good Creatures which God had given should be abused or wasted upon any account. And how tender was she and pitiful to the meanest Servant in her Family, if they were sick, or wanted her Help and Assistance, and the Lord wonderfully blest her Endeavours; for it may be truly said, she had a true regard unto him, as I have observed upon many occasions, her Heart was often tendered in a sense of the Mercies and Love of God, and this often was her
Expression, I give God the Glory. Or, Blessed be the Name of the Lord. And many times in the day, as she had Opportunity, she betook her self to her Closet to be retired, and many times came out amongst her Family as one whose Strength was inwardly renewed, in a cool and tender Frame of Spirit. O what could I say of her Sincerity and love to the Lord, his Truth and People! But shall summe up all in this, That she was a good Woman and very serviceable, as many in those parts do right well know. And as it was her earnest desire often in my hearing, so it is mine, That the Lord who raised her up in that Place and County, would be pleased to raise another in her stead and place to do as she hath done, that her Intentions may be fulfilled and answered, even the Propagation of the pretious and everlasting Truth, in which I do dearly Salute you all, and am your real Friend, Reading the 20th. of the 1st. Month, 1682/3. Benjamin Coales. A Coyy of a Letter sent to M. D. and Friends at Plymouth, the 14th. day of 10th. Month, 1682. Margery Dyer, AND the rest of Friends in Plymouth, knowing that you have a desire to hear how it is with our Friend Loveday Hambly, whose Fame for Good Works, Charity and Hospitality, is gone forth to the uttermost Confines of the Land of our Nativity; and we believe it may be affirmed with confidence, that her Renown is gone forth to the Isles afar off, as a Per∣son accounted famous among Gods People, for Sufferings, and Zealous of Good Works, ever since the Day that she was turned from Darkness to Light, and from the Power of Satan to God. Now Dear Friend, this may certifie thee and Friends there, that our Dear Friend above mentioned L. H. hath, by reason of Old Age, great Weekness and many Infirmities kept her Bed for the most part this Seven Weeks, being aged about seventy eight Years; and though we are here as in a House of Mourning, under the consideration of her Bodily Weakness, and in the sense of the Departure of such a Serviceable Friend: yet we are Comforted and Re∣freshed in that we can give a Living Testimony, that she is in a good Frame of Spirit in relation to Heavenly Things: for it hath been observed of late, that if any Friend or other of her Relations have spoken to her about any of her Outward Affairs, her Memory fail'd her, as to give any direct Answer: but when any Friend did Read or Pray by her, or speak to her of Spiritual Matters she hath been much Revived and full of good Expressions and Praises to the Lord for his manifold Mercies towards her; often saying, She desired nothing but the Kingdom of God: and in the Evening several Friends, Relati∣ons,
and Attendants being about her Bed with a Candle; one did desire to see her Tongue, she chearfully said, Take away the Candle, and let me have the Light of the Countenance of the Lord Jesus. And dayly and hourly she ceased not to sound forth the Praises of the Lord, and her Desires and Prayers to the Lord were, to continue his Mercy towards her. She saw her own weak∣ness, and believed in the Strength of the Lord: and as she drew near her End, she grew into a loving Child-like State and Condition to all that came to see her, desiring earnestly the Prosperity of Gods Truth; and often de∣clared her Intent in bestowing her Outward Estate in the manner as she had done, was, even that the Holy Truth might be propagated, and those that profess it might be Supported by her Free Gift after her Decease, and that Friends who did Travel in the Truths Service and were in want, might be supplyed by those to whom she left her Outward Estate; else, said she, I should never have left it to him. Here follow several of her Expressions taken by such as were with her the Night before her Departure. My Heart and Soul is poured forth unto thee, O thou Eternal God, thou art the Comfort and Salvation of Old Age: and the Desire of my Heart is, that all my Friends may be kept faithful to the Living God: for I declare here in the Presence of the Lord and before you, that I do love all the Children and Ser∣vants of the Living God with all my Heart, Soul and Strength. — And I de∣sire the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob with all my Heart and Soul, that I may faithfully fight under his Banner.— Moreover she said, The Lord knows my Heart, I never loved the Riches of this World, for what is it worth, it is all Vanity and Vexation of Spirit.— At another time she said, I desire to take up the Shield of Faith and the Helmet of Salvation, and that I may dwell in the House of God. After she had layn still a pritty while, like one in a sweet, Sleep, she opened her eyes, and seeing some of her Friends and Servants about her, she smilingly said, Methinks I have been in a great Warefare, and there was mighty Doings, and O what a Comfort it was to me; we will not fall out about it, for their Kingdom must come into my Kingdom. Again she said, My God, look over them, keep all thy Handmaids, my God, my God.— And not long before her Departure, in a good sence and deep Expression of Soul, she said, Glory, Glory, Eternal Glory, for thy great Kindnest and Love to thy Handmaid. — And many times after she would begin some good words, which she was not able to utter forth, but some Friends standing by her, would help her therein, and then she would rejoyce that her Mind was uttered by another, and so continued quiet as a Lamb for about fourteen hours before her Depar∣ture: then deep groans did proceed from her unil the eighth hour in the Morning, on the 14th. day of the 10th Month, 1682, at which time she de∣parted this Life, and slept with her Fathers, and as we hope and verily be∣lieve,
is entred into a blessed Eternity. And this is written and witnessed unto by thy Loving Friends, Thomas Salthouse. Richard Tregenow. Anne Salthouse. Loveday Beachamp. With several Servants and other Attendants. A farther Testimony concerning Dear Loveday Hambly, from T. S. SHould I undertake to set forth a Declaration of her Vertue in the last twenty years of her Life, while I have had acquaintance with her, it would require the Pen of a far readyer Writer, and fill more Paper than is intended at this time, for it is not practicable among us to garnish the Se∣pulcres of the Righteous, nor is it any way needful to write Letters of Recom∣mendation for the Dead, who are entred into the Rest prepared for Gods Peo∣ple and in quiet Possession of an Inheritance among them that are Sanctifyed by Faith in Christ Jesus, for the Spirit saith expresly, Blessed are the Dead that dye in the Lord, for they rest from their Labour, and their Works follow them. Our Dear Friend L. H. is now gone to her long Home, and we cease to sorrow for her that is fall'n asleep, like those that have no hope; for if in this Life only we have hope of Christ, we are of all men most miserable, for many are the Tryals of the Righteous, &c. And truly the Tribulations, Tryals, and Exercises of this good Woman were many in the Days of her Pilgrimage in this present World, as may in part appear by the Records of our Friends Sufferings in this County, some of which are in Print, and some in Manuscript, besides Reproaches, Tryals, and cruel Mockings that did attend us while the way was every where spoken against, in which we walk, and Worship the only true God of our Fathers in Spirit and in Truth. This Good Friend and Antient Widdow Woman was several times cast into Prison at Lanceston and Bodmine for the Possession and Practice of her Reli∣gion, and once constrained to ride to London, which is about 220 Miles from her House, to make appearance there for Non-payment of Tythes, &c. and at several times had her Goods taken away in great Quantities, to the value of many hundreds of pounds, sometimes fourty Head of Cattle at once, for her faithful Testimony against the Oppression of Tythes, and she did always take joyfully the spoiling of her Goods, with Bonds and Imprisonmens that did often attend her for Matter of Conscience, for no occasion could justly be ta∣ken against her, except concerning the Righteous Law, Way, and Worship of the Living God; for in other Cases she was always careful to owe nothing to any Man but Love; greatest Policy, Prudence and Care was to promote the Interest of the pretious Truth, and not only the Form, but the Power of Godliness, her House was made a House of Prayer, her Heart and Hand was
bountiful and open to administer to such as needed Food or Physick, and the Lord was pleased to give a great Blessing to her Endeavours; many of her Neighbours are witnesses or it at this day; her Charity and Hospitality was not confined to her Relations and the People of her own Perswasion, but was extended to Rich and Poor, Strangers and Enemies; yea, she was truly Kind and Charitable in her day to the utmost of her Ability, few in this Genera∣tion did exceed her for Love and Good Works▪ she was no Orator, as to ex∣press her Mind by Men-pleasing Excellency of Speech, or inticing fine words that Mens Wisdom teacheth, but her Love was manifested to be real Love, not in words only, but in Deed and in Truth, which gives me this Confi∣dence to say she was a Disciple indeed; and the Lord blest her in her Basket and Store, after all her Sufferings for Righteousness sake, and she never want∣ed Meat, Drink nor Cloathing to accomodate her Persecutors and their Chil∣dren, if they were either in want of Food or Raiment; neither did she say, be warm, and be cloathed and fed by others, but did it dayly and freely, for they were her own words often uttered in my hearing, What's all the World? I have enough, I will never live miserable to dye Rich. And yet she hath left a competent Estate to be divided amongst many of her Friends and Relations, and to the Poor of the Neighbouring Parishes, as appears by her last Will and Testament, her Command concerning her Funeral was carefully observed by her Relations and Friends, and many hundreds of sober People did accompa∣ny her to her Grave in a Decent Burying Place, in the Tenement of Trigan∣geeves, where her Dead Body is at rest, and her Spirit is returned to God that gave it, and to the Spirits of Just Men made perfect, and I believe her Name is written in Heaven, and she is entred in the Possession of that Peace and Joy in the Holy Ghost, which is the effect of everlasting Righteousness, and hath a Name and a Place in the House of the Lord, and within the Walls of Salvati∣on, even an everlasting Name that shall never be blotted out nor forgotten. Dear Friends, Brethren and Sisters who are asking the way to Zion, with your Faces thitherward, and who have desires to have Intelligence of the State of Affairs among Friends in these Parts: this gives you advice of the Departure of the above mentioned Mother in Israel; let it not trouble you, for it is well with her; and this is a living Testimony of never dying Love, that's given forth and sent to you from your Loving Friend and Fellow Travel∣ler in the way of Holyness, Austell in Cornwall, the 20th. of the 10th. Month, 1682. Thomas Salthouse The Testimony of Thomas Curtis. AS for Loveday Hambly that honourable Woman in the Flock of God, I have this Testimony to give for her, that her Nam  eth, although
she be gone to the Place prepared for all the Living, and her Memorial will abide among many Brethren, because of her great Care of the Truth amongst the Heritage of the Almighty. Before she was convinced of the Truth, she was a Zealous Professor, a Woman seeking after the Living God in the dead Forms of this World, and very diligent to follow after the best men then in esteem amongst those Pro∣fessors, not willing to miss a Lecture or Sermon at that season, if Sickness, or some other urgent occasion drew her not aside, marvelously beloved then by those Ministers that were most eminent in that Place and Part of the County, willing to hear them in their Exercise, and then greatly to befrind them; and in the beginning or breaking forth of the Truth, when some Friends rode through the County, and sounded the Trumpet of the Lord (for which they were taken and committed to the Common Goal in that County) a Con∣cern cme upon me to visit he Prisoners of the Great God, and finding them shut up in Doomsdale, a Dungeon in the Castle in Lancestn, I was troubled in my Spirit, and a farther Concern came upon me to go to the Ses∣sions, and visit a Commander whom formerly I was acquainted with, and then in Authority, to see if possible I might do any Service for the Lord, and assist my then suffering Brethren, which in Gods Strength I did perform, and in my Journying, I was guided to the House of my deceased Friend Loveday Hambly, where, after some discourse with her, she seemed to be inclinable to know the Truth, and God gave me a Testimony suitable to her present Con∣dition, and the Lord opened her Heart as he did the Heart of Lidia, and she was melted with the Word of Life, and the Lord so wrought upon her, that although I parted with her in a little time, and went forward, as it was with me, to the Place appointed, yet when I returned, her Love was greatly inlarged, and she constrained me to stay some time, and a Door of hope was opned to that Family, and several of the Neighbourhood, and many were prickt at the heart, and several good Meetings I had in the Family, and great tenderness was amongst them, & the Fame went forth of her convince∣ment, and the Word of God had a place in their Affections, and many were broken into tears, and this honourable Friend did comfort them, and was a strength to them, and though many stood a loof off, and others taunted at them, yet her Affections strongly increased towards them, and if any thing did befall them, she made it as her own Concern, for she valued no Delights of this World, but her Delight was in the Lord; she valued not the Glory of great Men, nher did she covet after great Possessions, but was contented with  Lot in her Pilgrimage, and as one that had found a Spring in a dry Ground, so was she in her Meditations; so that her Fame went far, and ma∣ny good Inclinations were in Peoples Minds; so that when I came again, as Doves to the Windows how did many flock, so that it was then very pleasant to me, & great Desires after the Lord appeared, & God opened a Fountain in
the Desert; but this made the old Serpent angry, and set his Ministers in a rage, and some came to the House like Champions, to see if they could re∣cover her again, many strong assaults were made in that day, but all in vain, sometimes I was met with by the Ministers on the High Way, sometimes challenged to come to the Fair, some private, some publick Discourses, but still her Love was fixed to the Lord, so that nothing could draw back her Af∣fections, because she had in some Degree seen the Kindness of the Lord, the more they strove, the closer she stuck to the Truth, and the more they prest on her, the more she saw their Weakness, and when they perceived that there was no recovery like to be, the Dragon cast a Flood out of his mouth at her, and prepared a Troop to come to her House to lay hold of me, which drew many tears from her eyes, but the Lord was with us, and so prevailed with the then Commanders, that the Lieutenant and Coronet were convin∣ced, and for some time stood in their Convincement, and the Coronet had a Meeting at his House, and great Peace then was her Portion, and her de∣light was amongst the People of the Lord, and which way she might lay out her Endeavours for the Truth: and as Friends came to visit the Prisoners at Lanceston they came to visit her, and her heart was open, and her House was free, and Meetings began to be settled, and as a Nursing Mother in Israel, so was she: but when Faithfulness entred her heart, so that she could not put into the mouths of the Priests and Impropriators, they soon prepared War against her, and a deep Sufferer was she both by Priest and Impropriator, and often her Cows, Horses, Oxen, Sheep and Calves taken away, as the Records of that County can make appear; much spoil they made of her Estate, so that sometimes her Cattle was so clean gone and carryed away by the Spoilers, as if no recovery of a Stock were like to be again, but God was a Portion to her, and whil'st that Prophesie of the Prophet Isaiah was fulfilling upon her Adversaries, Isaiah 33.5. Wo unto thee that spoilest, and thou wast not spoiled. Her Cows did Calve, her Sheep did Yean and bring forth, and the Fleece did grow again; and Gods Indignation did fall upon the Spoylers, and the Goods did not prosper in their Hands, but a Consumption came upon it, and it wasted and melted away, doing but little good, and in the End the Lord cut them off from the Earth, and gave them their Portion with the Spoilers: So that Scripture came to be fulfilled, the Righteous shall be had in ever∣lasting Remembrance, but the Name of the Wicked shall rot. This did not altogether quiet the Adversaries, but when they had taken her Goods, they sought after her Body also, which they had at their Pleasure ready for the Prison, sometimes in one Prison, sometimes in another, the Goalers can give a more full account of her Personal Suffering, for having found the Pearl of great Price, she was willing to part with all for the Enjoyment of ht Treasure, and believing that there was a measure of the Sufferings of Christ Jesus behind for her to fill up, she consulted not with Flesh and Blood, but gave
her Body to the Prison, and left her Goods to the Spoyler, as believing God was able to multiply her Substance; and truly as Truth prospered in her heart, so her Substance was increased, and her Eye was to the Lord that gave it, and Gods Word was her delight, and Meetings still increased, and her Faithfulness was found, and a nursing Mother was she to the Feeble and Week, for she was a Woman of great Hospitality, and her Love extended to all; the Rich knew her heart was free, the Poor missed not her house, the Stranger lodged not in the Street, but she opened her Door to the Traveller, and many times relieved she her very Enemies, and to say the truth of her, she was very bountiful, and an open handed Woman, do∣ing good to all, but more especially to the Houshold of Faith, she was no Flat∣terer of any Person, nor one that would daub with untempered Mortar, but as her heart was, so was her Language, dealing truly with all without re∣spect of Persons, she feared no man, neither could any mans frowns make her start aside, the Plain-mans Path was her delight, she feared God, and took pleasure in his People, and it was her Meat and Drink to do the Will of her Master Christ Jesus: she loved to hear of the Prosperity of Truth, and of the well-being of Friends, and when she had their Compa∣ny, then was her heart inlarged to the Lord: after this manner she passed over about twenty six years of her Sojourning here in this World, and as all our Fathers were, so was she seeking after that Country, and to find out that City whose Builder and Maker is the Lord. She constantly had Meetings at her House once or twice a week, and took great pleasure therein, and often would have a private time to her self in her Closet, to spread her condition before the God of Jacob: She never turned her back upon the Truth, neither for fear of loss of Goods, nor did the threatnings of the Prison daunt her, but according to the measure of Grace that she had received, her Bow did abide in its full strength, and under∣went the sentence of Many Fines, and greatly rejoyced when any were convinced; the Truth was so pleasant to her, that she would still send to her Relations to come and hear it, and when she had a Friend that she was well pleased with, both Rich and Poor invited she unto the Meeting: but now she is gone from us, and we believe she is taken away from the Evil that is to come, and her Good Works and Charity follow her: yet time will speak of the Integrity of her Heart, and of her great Love to Friends, although she is removed from us; she hath been preserved af∣ter a wonderful manner in her latter years, and often saw it was the Lord that raised her up, and would say, she believed that the Prayers of Friends did prevail with the Lord, and that her Days were lengthened out that she might be yet more serviceable. She lived to a great Age, which but few do come to: David saith, The Age of Man is threescore Years and ten. But this Friend of ours lived fourscore Years want but two:
and if in that day it was counted a wondrous Old Age, what may we now esteem it? but she hath finished her Course amongst men, and departed out out of this World the 14th. of the 10th. month, 1682. And I doubt not but is ascended up to God, out of all the Troubles that overtake the Sons of Men. And the Lord Raise up many more such Mothers, for the comforting of the Distressed, saith my Soul, who am your Loving Brother and Compani∣on in the Truth of our Lord Jesus Christ. Thomas Curtis.
