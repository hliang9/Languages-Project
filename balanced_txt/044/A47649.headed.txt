The Coppy of a Letter sent from Generall Leishley to the Lord Generall the Earle of Holland, and read in the House of Commons, the 7th. of Iuly, 1641. My Lord, I Give your Lordship hearty thanks that you have been pleased to acquaint me with your arrivall at Yorke, I had some notice given me before by our Commissioners of his Majesties Commands, and the desire of the Parliament, for that happy and peaceable service your Lordship is now about. I am glad that I am at Darrington by accident, in that place where I may give the more speed and incouragement, which your Lordship desireth and expects from me. This shall be done with all possible diligence: For as at the first, the reason of sending any Troops towards the Tees, was for inlargement of their Quarter, and the great ease of the rest of the Bishoprick; so now, the retyring shalbe to take away al jealousy from the Army of our aboade in this part of the County: For although the streightning of our Quarter wilbe both prejudiciall to the Countrey and us, yet God forbid it should be
made a pretext to make the least stay to the good worke your Lordship hath in hand; and the further we remove from other in this end, we are the nearer to be joyned in all hearty affection for the service of the King: Wherfore so sure grounds of Hope are now layd, that all his Majesties Three Kingdomes Enemies will have as much cause to feare the ill efâˆ£fects of our Union, as they had matter of rejoyceing at the too long lasting discord between us: And it may be so in all ages to come; which is the hearty wish and Prayer of Your Lordships most humble Servant, H. LEISHLEY. Dorringtonthe 2 of July, 1641.
