An ACT for the Relief and Release of poor Distressed Prisoners for Debt or Dammages. CHAP. I. FORASMUCH as very many persons now detained in Prison, are miserably Impoverished, either by reason of the late Vnhappy Rebellion in this Kingdom, their own Misfortunes, or otherwise, so as they are total∣ly Disabled to give any Satisfaction to their Creditors; and by being detained in Prison without advantage to any, are rendered Vse∣less and a Burthen to the Kingdom, to the great Prejudice thereof. Be it therefore Enacted by the Kings Most Excellent Majesty, by, and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons in this present Parliament As∣sembled, and by Authority of the same, That all persons who were in Prison upon the First Day of August, in the Year of Our Lord God One thousand Six hundred Ninety seaven, for Debt or Damages, or for, or upon any Action or Actions, or upon any Mean Process for Debt, or other Actions whatsoever; which Actions by Prosecution of Law may become Iudgments, or who have Iudgments Entred upon Record against them, or are Charged in Execution, or
Imprisoned upon Attachment Debt, or upon Outlawries, before or after Iudgment for Debt, or upon any other Process whatsoever, Issuing out of any Court of Law or Equity, for the Cause of Debt or Damages, or Costs only, who shall take the Oath hereafter men∣tioned, shall and may be Released, and Dischar∣ged from their Imprisonment, in such way and manner, as is herein and hereafter provided. And be it further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That it shall and may be lawful to, and for any Iustice of the Peace of any County, City, Town or Liberty, within the Kingdom of Ireland, by Warrant under his Hand and Seal, to Require the Sheriff, Goaler, or Keé∣per of any Prison within his respective Iuris∣diction, to bring before him without delay, the Body of any Person being in Prison for Debt, or any other Action, as aforesaid, on the First Day of August aforesaid, and the said person Petitioning such Iustice to be Discharged to some convenient place, within the distance of One Mile from the said Prison, and shall certifie the Cause and Causes of the Imprisonment, before the same Iustice; which Warrant every such Sheriff, Goaler and Keéper, is hereby Com∣manded to obey: And in Case such Prisoner coming before such Iustice, shall take an Oath to this effect, before the said Iustice. I A. B. do upon my Corporal Oath, Solemnly Profess and Declare before Almighty God, That I am not worth in Lands, Money, Goods or Stock, nor any other Estate, Real or Personal in Possession, Reversion, or Remainder, of the value of Five pounds in the whole, or sufficient to pay
the Debt or Damage, for which I am Imprisoned: And that I have not directly, or indirectly Sold, Leased, or otherwise Conveyed, Disposed of, or In∣trusted all, or any part of my said Money, Lands, Goods, Stock, or Estate, whereby to secure the same to Receive, or expect any profit or advantage thereof, or to Defraud or Deceive any Creditor or Creditors whatsoever, to whom I am Indebted. So help me God, &c. Which said Oath, the said Iustice of the Peace, is hereby Impowered and Authorized to Administer; that then after the making of such Oath, the said Iustice shall Remand the Priso∣ner to Prison, and shall without Feé give a Cer∣tificate thereof in writing under his Hand and Seal, to the said Prisoner, to be served on such person or persons, his or their Executors, or Administrators, or to be left at the place of the usual Abode of such person or persons, at whose Sute the Prisoner standeth Charged and Imprisoned, thereby appointing as well the said person or persons, as the said Prisoner, to ap∣pear before the Iustices at the next General-Quarter-Sessions of the Peace, to be held for the same County, City, Town or Liberty; and when it shall appear upon Oath, before the said Iustices, which said Oath, the said Iustices are hereby Impowered and Authorized to Ad∣minister, that the said Certificate was so served, or left, Ten Days or more, before the said Ses∣sions; and that the said Oath taken by the said Prsoner, be not disproved by good Testimony, of any Credible person or persons upon Oath, to be Administred by the said Iustices, by Vir∣tue of this Act; Then the said Iustices being
satisfied therein, shall without Feé direct their Warrant under their Hands and Seals, com∣manding the said Sheriff, Goaler, or Keéper of the Prison, to let at Liberty, and Discharge the said Prisoner, if Imprisoned for the Causes a∣foresaid, and no other, without paying any thing for the Feés, or Chamber-Rent; Which Warrant shall be a sufficient Discharge to the said Sheriff, Goaler, or Keéper of the Prison, and no Action of Escape, or other Action shall be brought against them, or any of them in any wise for the same. Provided always, That if any Creditor shall insist to have his Debtor continued in Prison af∣ter he hath taken the said Oath, and will allow him a weékly Maintainance, to be appointed by the Iustices of the Peace, not exceéding Four∣teén pence the Weék; that such Prisoner shall be continued in Prison for the space of Threé Months, on Payment of the said weekly Al∣lowance, as aforesaid; which said Money shall be Paid weékly to the said Prisoner himself, and not to the Goaler, Keéper, or any other for him: And if within the space of Threé Months, after such weékly Allowance by any Creditor, no E∣state of the Prisoner shall be Discovered or Made out, before Two Iustices of the Peace of that County and Division, where the said Prisoner is kept in Prison, then the said Prisoner shall without Feé be forthwith Discharged, by War∣rant under the Hands and Seals of any Two Iustices of the Peace, of the same County or Division, where the said Prisoner shall be so Imprisoned, to the Keéper of such Prison, in that behalf Directed as fully and amply, as if such Prisoner shall be so Imprisoned to the
Keéper of such Prison in that behalf, directed as fully and amply as if such Prisoner had beén Discharged by Iustices of the Peace at the Quarter-Sessions: And that then, and from thenceforth, the said Weékly Allowance shall cease and determine, as if the same had never beén made. And be it further Enacted by the Authori∣ty aforesaid, That no Prisoner Discharged out of Prison by Virtue of this present Act, shall at any time hereafter be Im∣prisoned for, or by reason of any Debt or Dama∣ges, or any Summ or Summs of Money con∣tracted or grown due to, or recovered by any person or persons at whose Sute the said Priso∣ner did stand Charged in any Prison, or any other person or persons to whom such Prisoner did give notice under the Hand and Seal of some Iustice of the Peace of the same County or place, the space of Ten days before the time of his Discharge, of his Intention to receive the Benefit of this Act, and of the Way and Course he intended to take for obtaining the same, before the time of their Discharge, as aforesaid. But that upon any Arrest for such Debt, Damages, or Summs of Money, it shall and may be Law∣ful for them, shewing a Duplicate of their Dis∣charges under the Hands and Seals of the Iu∣stices of the Peace, by whom they were Dis∣charged, or of any Two of them, or of such Iu∣stices of the Peace, in Case such Prisoner be discharged after an Allowance of Maintenance by the Creditors for Threé Months, as afore∣said, which the said Iustices are hereby Requi∣red to give without Feé to every Prisoner so by them discharged, to retain an Attorney to appear for them, and File Common Bail to every such
Action, and Plead thereunto, so that the Plan∣tiff (if he please) may Recover and Enter Iudgment against such Prisoner, to be Execu∣ted and Levyed upon the Lands, Tenements, Goods and Chattels of such Prisoner so dischar∣ged, as aforesaid; his or her Wareing Apparel, Furniture for his or her Dwelling House, the said Furniture and Necessary Tools for his or her Trade and Occupation not exceéding Five pounds in Value, only Excepted, but not upon the person or persons of the Prisoners, the per∣sons of such Prisoners being hereby for ever freéd and discharged from Imprisonment for any Debt, Trespass upon the Case, Duty, Summ or Summs of Money, or things there∣unto relating, contracted or due before the time of their Discharge, having had Notice, as a∣foresaid. And be it further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That in Case any Sheriff, Goaler, or Keéper of a Prison, shall refuse or delay for Threé days, to bring before such Iustice of the Peace, or after a Warrant of Discharge deliver∣ed to him, as aforesaid, refuse or neglect to set at Liberty any Prisoner or Prisoners according to the said Order of the Iustice or Iustices of the Peace, made in the pursuance of this Act; every such Goaler, Sheriff, or Keéper of Prison shall Forfeit and pay to such Prisoner so detain∣ed, contrary to such Order, the Summ of Twenty pounds, to be Recovered by Bill, Plaint, Sute, or Action of Debt, in any of His Majesty's Courts of Record, wherein no Essoyne Protection, or Wager of Law is to be allowed, nor more than one Imparlance Grant∣ed; and shall also be liable and subject to such
Fine and Imprisonment for such time, not ex∣ceéding Two Months, as the said Iustices of the Peace shall, upon Complaint thereof to them made, Order and Award. And be it further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That upon any Action of Escape, or other Sute brought, or to be brought, against any Iustice of the Peace, Sheriff, Goaler, or Keéper of Prison, for any thing done in Obe∣dience to this Act, it shall and may be Lawful to, and for any such Iustice of the Peace, She∣riff, Goaler, and Keéper of Prison, to Plead the General Issue, and give this Act in Evi∣dence, which shall be a Good and Sufficient Discharge, and save harmless every such Iu∣stice of the Peace, Sheriff, Goaler and Keéper of Prison, Pleading the same; and if the Plan∣tiff in any such Action be Non-Suted, or Ver∣dict pass against him, the Defendant shall have Double Costs, to be Taxed by the Court where such Action is brought.
