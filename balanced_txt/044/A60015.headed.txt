The Episile to the Reader. COurteous Reader I have here undertaken to give you a full and satisfactory Account of the Life and Death of the far-Famed and Most Renowned English Champion GUY Earl of War∣wick, according to what can be Collected out of the best Historians, both Antient and Modern. No Work in this Nature ever yet appearing to the World with more then half a Face, or an imperfect Relation, the which has rather sullied the He∣roick Actions of so brave a man, then caused them to shine in their Native Brightness, which was one of the chief Causes that incited me to venture this vast Scene, which includes not only Europe, but great part of Asia e'r it can be finished, having ever had a Veneration for the Memories of Worthy men I thought not fit to let such Lawrels wither in the dust as hertofore have flourished on the Brows of our Renowned Hero, England's greatest boast, well knowing how great an Ingratitude it is, to let that Honour lye buryed in silence that of the Nation has deserved so well: and above all, I consider there is no greater Spur to prick forwards the minds of men to undertake Great Designs and Vallarous Exploits, than by Reading the worthy Deeds of such as have thereby attained to the height of Glory: For stories of Bat∣tels and of Warlike Enterprizes, if drawn to the Life, do most common∣ly (as it were) bear fire in themselves, the which often so inflames the Souls of youth, that it stirs them up with a desire to imitate the same, and the very remembrance inspires them with courage, for the Soul of man being composed of a fiery substance, if not restrained by dulness and gross Hu∣mours of the body, will be ever reaching after this suble, placed in a more then ordinary Sphear, especially in English men, who at this day are Famed for Courage and true Heroick Vallor through all the yet known World. No Nation under Heaven but in that must give us the prehemi∣nencey, or we may justly claim it as our Birthrights. And now dear Countrey-men since I have taken some small pains in drawing out this Hi∣story as near as possible to the Life, I hope you will be so just to the Memory of this Renowned Earl, as to read over his Warlike and Pious Actions, if not to imitate them, which is the only wish of him who is a greater admi∣rer of true worth. Your loving Country man to serve you JOHN SHURLY.
The Argument. HOw Guy Lineally descended from Cassibilanus, the Pamous British Prince, with a brief Account of the Roman and Saxon Conquest over this Isle of Guy's Birth and Parentage, his Youthful Exploits and first falling in Love with Phaelice, and what passed between them, how she sent him abroad to Fight, having been admonished of his warlike Exploits in a Dream, how Guy Landing in Nor∣mandy killed two Champions and grievously wounded the third, freeing a Lady who was wrongfully condemned to dye, how he was pursued by Duke Philbertus, how he fought with him at Sea and took him Prisoner, how he worsted all the Ger∣man Princes, and won from them the Emperours Daughter, he returning here to England kills the monstrous Dun Cow, after being sent abroad he kills sixteen of Duke Ottons men who lay in a wood to intercept his Life; assists the Duke of Lo∣vain against Lorain, raises the Siege with a dreadful overthrow, afterwards makes Peace, and with two thousand men puts to Sea in order to the Relief of Bi∣zantium, Besieged by the Turks, meets with several Pirates and destroyes many of them, raises the Siege and kills several of the Pagan Champions, routing their Armies: Terty wounded and his Lady taken from him, the which he restores and assists his Father, Besieged by Duke Otton whom he in single Combate kild, a Dra∣gon and a Bore, then returns to England and kills another Dragon in Northum∣berland, after that, is Married, then departs on Pilgrimage to the Holy Land, Kills Amarant a huge Giant and delivers those that he kept in Tortures, routs A∣manthus and restores Earl Terry to his Earldome, returns to England Combats Colbron the Danish Giant and kills him, put the Armies to rout, freeing England, then lives in a Cave unknown to all bus the King, at his death seads Phaelice his Ring, who coming to him closed his Eyes, and shortly after dyes her self for grief, are splendidly buryed in one Tombe, with an Epitaph infixed, and many other particulars more at large.
CHAP. I. A Brief Narration of the Roman and Saxon Conquest made of this Island, and of the mise∣ries it endured, which brings us to the Birth and Lineal decent of our Famous Champion the Heroick Earl. WHen Rome had spread her Ensignes wide into the world, and made most Nations yield unto her Arms, France totally subdued some wenty years before our Saviours Birth: Caesar ambitious of more Honour, from the distant shore, cast his Eyes on this our Brittish Isle, enclosed with white Rocks, (from whence most do affirm it took its name) and rounded with the Sea, then wild and barbarous, without Law or civil Customes; all painted people and in manners strange) yet the great Warriour fired with successful Fortune, regarding not the People but the Land, desirous to anex it to his Conquests, and the Roman Empire, by reason of its temperate and pleasant scituation; set sail from Callis with 200 Ships, thinking with his experienced Legions and old Sol∣diers trained in War, in a short space to over run this Isle, then ignorant in seats of Arms; but ere he Landed, found true Brittish valour so beyond his expectation, that he stood amazed: for the Britains having notice of the Invasion, all assembled under their several Kings or Princes. Cassibilain a Famous Britain, then being chief; from whom renowned Guy our famous English Champion sprung; they encountered the Romans so fiertely at their Landing, that Caesar himself was forced shamefully to retreat with the lsss of his own sword, and several Ensigns and Standards were taken, his Army broken and he forced back to France to make Recruits: such was the valour then our Nation bore, and at the first onset foiled proud Rome, to whose dread Arms the world thier portion homage paid, nor did she make a Conquest here at last by the Sword, but after infinite loss and twenty years toil, was forced to grant the Britains their own terms; the which was in the Reign of Augustus, about the time of our Saviours birth, that Prince of peace who established peace through∣out the world; and for 400 years that the Roman Emperours by their Lieutenants Ruled this Isle, no nation afforded more valiant & redoubted men, who were continually drawn out for to supply their Armies in most quarters of the world: till the Red horse went out to take peace from the Earth, and the Roman Empier was grown so great, that the bole was not able to support the branches; whereupon the Goths and Vandals breaking in∣to Italy, tore it in pieces so that the Romans to save their own nearer home abandoned this Isle, and carried with them all the flower of Brirish Chivalry; upon which the Scots and Picts taking the advantage, overrun the Northern parts, destroying all with sire & sword lamentably, that the distressed Britains were forced to call unto their aid the Saxons, a arlik people that then flourished in Germany which helped but to make their miseries the
greater, for after they had subdued the British Enemies, they became worse Enemies themselves; for Hingest and Horsus their two Captains, observing the fruitfulness and pleasant Cituation of the Countrey, were loath to return to their own barren soyl without good Bootyes; whereupon, and the better to create a quarrel, the former Married his Daughter to Vortimor the British King (descended lineally from the before mentioned Cassibilain) raised no small regret amongst the British Nobility, especially because through her means the Saxons were preferred to the chief Dignities, the which increased their interest, & got them sirmer footing in the Land, of which they complaining to the King and finding no Redress, put some Affronts upon the Saxon Chiefs, who glad of any opportuni∣ty for to beget a quarrel thereupon (as they pretended for want of their promised pay) seized several Towns wherein their Soldiers were quartered; this Allarmd the Britains, who Headed by the young Prince Vortimors Son, overthrew them in a pitched Battel though not without muth slaughter on both sides: and after having driven them out of all their places of strength, obliged them to leave the Land; but long they rested not content, for the next year having gathered a great strength, they set sail for this Isle, the shores of which were so manfully defended against them, that they finding no possibility to Land, desired a Truce, and that they might Treat with the British Nobility about delivering them their Daughter; the which after some debate was granted, and about sixty of the Saxons came on shore privately Armed to Treat with the like number of Britains; and in the midst of the Treaty, every Saxon (as it was before contrived amongst them) slew his man, unless one who Treated with (as some say) the Earl of Warwick, the Earl see∣ing the Treathery prevented him by pulling up a hedgestake, with which he heat out his brains, and kid five or six more, himself getting away with only a slight wound in the lest arm. The chief Nobility being thus murthered by Treathery, the amazed Britains Retreated, and gave the Saxons opportunity to Land, the which they had no sooner done, but they fell to their old trade of laying all wast with fire and sword; the which they exe∣ented with such cruelty, as made the people fly before them to the Mountains (which are now talled Wales, and are the real antient Britains) leaving their houses and what they could not carry or drive away to the ravage of the bloody Conquerors, who devided the Na∣tion into seven parts, and named it a Hepterchy, each portion having a King over it, which continued so in civil wars amongst themselves about three hundred years, till it was totally subdued by Edgard the great King of the West-Saxons named Athelstone a∣bout the sixt year of whose Reign was the ever famous Champion Giraldus Cassibilanius,  called Guy of Warwick, who as credible Historians do affirm, descended lineally om the British Royal ood, ever since Cassibilanius the warlike Prince before recited, through the many changes and miseries of War clouded in obscurity, which no will be the Subject of this ensing History; since we have already shown you the miserie of truel War, and the bravery of British spirits under such afflictions, and traced through
the many adverse windings the descent of our Hero, Englands chief glory, whose name will live while time shall be no more. And still be sounded by the trump of Fame, Where e'r she English Valour does proclaim. CHAP. II. How Guy descended from Cassibilanius the Renowned British Prince, of his Birth and Youthful Exploits: and how he fell in Love with Phaelice the Earls beauteous Daugh∣ter, and how she despised his suit. GUy rald us Cassibilanius Son of Gordian Caslibilanius (but more vulgarly known by the name of Guy of Warwick, by which name we must trace the History of his Life) born in the famous City of Warwick, in the Sixth year of the Reign
of Edgard the Great, his Father being an accomplished Gentleman, and had formerly a very good Estate in Northumberland, which he was forced to part with, to save his life, at the time of his being taken Prisoner; for bearing Arms under the subdued Saxon King of Mercia: Vpon which resignation obtaining his Liberty from the Martial in whose custody he was, he came to Warwick and there so well behaved himself that he won the affections and good likeing of all the Gentry, but especially of Earl Robands, whom the King had made Governour of the Town and Castle; who took him into his house and made him his Steward; in which place he behaved himself so well, that he won the affections of a Kinghts Daughter in the Town, which he married, and on her begat renowned Guy, the subject of this famous History, who might be said like Hercu∣les from his very infancy to be made for War, and great Exploits; being so well limb∣ed from head to foot, as might denote a stout and Warlike Hero would in time from that bold infant rise; nay, and his mothers Dreams presaged no less: for during her preg∣nancy, she fancied that Mars descended in a bloody Chariot drawn by two fiery Dragons, and told her, that the infant that her womb contained, should be the Glory of this Nati∣on; and so great in Arms renownd, as should amaze mankind and he the terrour of the Pagan world; this she declared to the Countess of VVarwick about a moneth before her delivery, which after wards proved true, as shall amply he related: For no sooner had he attained to eight years of age, but he began to practice skill in Wrastling, Running, Throwing stones, and other Exertises that his tender years were capable of, in which he exceeded all that were much older and far bigger than himself, to the admiration of of those that observed him more curiously; his delight was in hardships and laborious exercise, and so continued till sixteen, at which age few men could encounter with him, be then was used to enter the List, and wheresoever he came, alwaies came off with ap∣plause. Insomuch that the Earl hearing of his unmatched exploits, sent for him and entertained him at dinner with himself and several of the Gentry of that Countrey, but above all Phaelice his beauteous daughter, Angel bright, and with accomplished Graces Fraught, on whom Guy firing his youthful eyes, immediately felt Loves Arrows wound his soul, and passion, like a Fever burned within; still as he gazed he felt new flames, and so unexpected a surprise, that all began to wonder at the suddain change; his Father demanded the cause, but could not get the secret from his brest, it stuck too close, yet after the sumptuous repast he played several Prizes before the Earl, and being stung by Love, grew more fierce against his Cumbatants; or perhaps to shew the Lady his Valour, and to make her to have some esteem of his worth; so that at Wrastling, Back-word, Faulcheon, or the like, none were able to stand before him; for his force med more than man, and all that he struck or laid his hand upon he felled or tumbled to the ground; so that at the last none durst Encounter him: he seeing that, put on his Clothes, and going to the Earl humbly desired his Licence to retire himself, as he pre∣tended,
for refreshment; at which the Earl embracing him, said, Go thou worthy Youth our Nations Pride, and withal gave him a Ring set with Diamonds, as like∣wise several other Noble men made him Presants, the which he unwillingly received, modestly excusing the Applauses, and Favours they had heaped upon him, saying, he was not worthy of them, and that his whole Lives Service must make them Restitution for those benefits he had received at their hands, which modestly made them yet com∣mend him more, and have a greater Esteem of his Vertues, and each was the more desi∣rous of his company; but at his earnest request, and the approach of night they dismissed him, upon his promise to attend them the next day; after he was departed, and the Table sumptuously spread, wine in abundance was called for, and supper no sooner en∣ded, but the Earl began Guys health, each of the Lords and Gentry presant pledging it with their hats off. Such Fame got he by his prevailing manhood, after which round their whole discourse was of his hopefulness, and the great Endowments that Nature and Art had conspired to bestow upon, Guys Father was muth joyed in his happy Son, &c. But now we must leave them in the midst of their Iollitry, and sollow Guy into his secret retirement, where being arrived, he began to contemplate upon what he had seen, and could hardly perswade himself that she was mortal, so far his fancy wrought upon her perfections, for indeed she was fair even to a Miracle, so that that age afforded her no parallel; for Eyes she had that glistered like two Stars, shaded with eyehrows plea∣sant to behold, a fair high Forehead, and cheeks as smooth as Alablafter, in which the Roses and the Lisies mired so pure, that none could discern which had the superiority, her Teeth like orient Pearls, enclosed with Coral Lips, and such a winning smile as might ravish the beholder, with a smooth chin transparent, whilst in curious wreaths her Golden Tresses hung; to these add a majestick grace and comly mean: To summe up all Natures masterpiece, the only wonder of her sex. These considered, wrackt poor Guy almost to despair of ever attaining such an accomplished creature, while thus he gives his passion vent, how am I lost, for ever lost, in what a pathless maze is it I won∣der, can Loves soves force be such, to wound a heart that never injured his deity; but if it must be so, that it is thy sport (winged god) to wound us Mortals with thy staming shafts let her (in whose bright eyes thou satest when first thou wingedst them with her Glances and darted them into my breast) feell an equal passion, or else tis Tyranny to orture one thou art not purposed to relieve: how am I wrapped in clouds, not knowing here I am, so quickly snarched into the unknown Regions, where I cannor turn un∣ the right or to the left, but must either sore aloft, or fall into confusion, wild and ru∣ , the latter is sure if nor revented by the souner; for me to attain that auteous, ly form divine, my soul-desire, I fear is altogether impossible, by reason of the in∣e dissance in our Fortunes, she to high and I so mean and low; yet that me thinks
should not divide us; Love is far more pure than Gold, and wieness my wounds its forte is irresistable: O ye powers! for what are these treated beings, these soster heau∣ties if not to be enjoyed? or did ye send these Angellick shapes from your bright abodes, only to be gazed upon and wondered at by Love-sick man, and punish him by what he never must possess; tis sure they were not, nor can such lovely shapes lodge curelty, or proud disdain within their breasts, why then neglect I to declare my suit? who knows but she may prove kind or burn with equal flame? seeing her eyes bent equally with mine, and glance for glance she often sent, and now and then a heavenly smile which ended in a blush; I'l be no longer tortured thus between hope and despair, but will go to her, and with low obedience tell her that I Love, so receive my sentance of Life or Death from her fair lips; but alass! how shall I do it, seeing I am unskilful in that grand affair? assist me then thou god of Love, and send one of thy golden shafts before to make me room & yeild me succesful in this my bold attempt, Virgin I come, my Fever burns wo fierce to be delayed. So saying, he stayed his language with a peal of sighs, strait arose from the solitary bed whereon he lay, & in the best attice he had, posted to Warwick Castle where he heard his Love was gone to recreate her self, but scartely was he entered, ere he met the Earl with many of the Gentry, preparing for a Hunting match, all of them welcoming Guy, and desired his company, but he excused himself by telling them he was much in∣cisposed, and so with much adoe obtained his exemption of the Earl, who immediately sent for his Physitian, and gave him strickt charge to be careful of his bealth and preser∣vation: so the Earl to Hunting rode, and Guy was conducted to his Chamber, where the Physitian made no small ad to enquire into the Nature of his Malady; but the more he sought the more be found himself at a loss; at which he perceiving Guy to smile dis∣deinfully, the better to save his credit, told him he must be dieted, blooded, and keep his chamber, or his distemper would grow worse; to which, Guy rising from his seat, on∣swered; Truly Father, at this time of your prescriptions, ther's no need, nor can your Art afford the least rellef, no Gallen or Hipocrates themselves were they alive and both here present, could not give me ease; tis my self must be my own Physitian, or my Ma∣lady must reign for ever over me: There is a slower as I have lately heard, of precious worth, growing in this Castle, the which could I once pluck, would ease me in a mo∣ment; at which the Doctor stood in admiration, wondring what stower he meant, why truly sir said he tis called Happy, indeed quath the Doctor happiness is good, but as for a flower of that name, in all my curious search I never found nor heard of, pray sir said Guy leave me, and I sear not but to find it out, for I am sure it grows within the walls; at which the Doctor took his leave, and Guy ascended up the Castle stairs to vi the prospect of the Gardens round, into which he had no sooner cast his eyes but he beh the beauteous maid that was sole Empress of his heart, sitting alone in a shady Bov
to screen her from the suns hot Rays, while before her the springing water of a Cristal Fountain played and sent refreshment to each fragrant flower or lovely plant that crow∣ned the happy place, resembling another Paradise, and she the first created woman; these Guy takes as happy Omens and resolves to venture now for life or death, and thus invokes Loves Deity to aid him in the great design. Oh propitious power, if ever, now prove kind in aiding thy humble suppliant, who is all obedience unto thy commands and aies his unspotted vows at thy great Altar, which ever blazes bright with slaming hearts of Lovers, offered up as Trophies of thy power; assist me to Court this famous beauty, and teach me how to wooe and how to Conquer her who has already conquored me: so saying, he descended with all speed, and coming to the Garden gate, knocked softly, and soon found admittance by one of the Damsels that waited on fair Phaelice, the which he no sooner had, but composing his warlike face into the best form he could; he made towards her with low reverence, who (expecting he came with some message from her Father) rose up to meet him, when Guy with Love surtharged, thus began. Fairest of Creatures, brightest of your sexes, made of such kindred mould to Heaven that you seem Angelical, a goddess all divine; therefore I have here brought a heart by Loves command to offer at your shrine; O frown not on me with disdainful Eyes, least with such a look death enter and destroy the man that ever shall admire, and with this awful distance adore your matchless Virtues; despise me not thou only center of my soul, who loves thee more than life, O that I could express my boundless passion, or that thou couldst look into my breast, and there behold how the tormenting flames still roal about my heart, that with a continual Fever burns, in which the Arrows of your pointed beauty stick; that Lords and Noble men have courted you I am not ignorant, but none could Love like me; pardon my boldness Lady, that to save my life I sue, with the same fear a guilty prisoner beholds his angry Judge; for your power's for grea∣ter when Life or death depends upon your smiles or frowns. To whom thus Phaelice with majestick countenance replyed: Alas sir, Love is such a thildish toy I ne'r intend to try it, theresore cease your vain suit, a Virgins happy life shall be my choice for ever; Love is but a dream composed of idle santies, and that I should wound you is impossible, or if such it could be, you them must blame your rash and unadvised folly, to attempt things so far above your reath; could you imagine that the Heir of Warwick would ere condescend to Marry with one so far beneath in birth, and in each dagree unsi, no therefore I would advise you to desist this enterprize, least it come unto my Fathers rat, and beget the sharp rebuke. So saying she ended, and Guy prepared to answer, hut she turned away disdainfully and left hun to himself now hopeless, perplered and tortured worse than ever. Cursing the cruel Stars that ruled his birth And wishing now to be no more on Earth
CHAP. III. How Guy being denyed, fell distracted for a time, till Cupid representing him in a War∣like posture, and declaring what wonders should be wrought by him to Phaelice in her sleep, telling her it was his mothers command that she should love him, whereupon she granted her consent upon condition of his performing glorious enterprizes. HAlf distracted with what had passed, Guy retires to his Fathers house thinking to shake off the Chains of Love, or burst them by some other means; for like Hercu∣les's yovson'd shirt, the more he strove the more the venom worked and the distentper fol∣lowed him wheresoever he went, for which he finding no relief, grew frantick for a time, quite bereft of sence or reason, and to this purpose uttered his phrensies and ran into dis∣order far beyond Orlando or Orestes.
Am I then slighted (sald he) who evermore will trust to woman-kind? accursed cruel Love, couldst thou leave me thus? can she not Love, or loves she some one else, which hinders her Love from passing unto me? O that I knew my Rival, my dread arm should hurl such vengean an his hend as should amaze mankind; I'd drag him cound the world, ore Sea and Land, and  him into circling fires, plung him into roaring Erebus, there to broyl in Brimstone flames and scorched for ever. O Jove Jove! Ile to thy Courts and hollow loud, nay I will thunder to your regardless power, and make you deaf with everlasting cries, from the Suns bright Chariot snatch cherial sire, set your Celestial mansions in a blaze, melt down your golden Roofs, and make your gates of Adamant fly from off their Tiamond hinges; arm my self with Lightning, and make vollued thunders roar around the world; Eacus, Mines, Rodomanthus, and all the black Infernal powers, what have ye done, my Love she's lost, for ever gone; sink sink earths frame to thy first Chaos, and with thy ruine crush mankind; drop, drop ye ctars and ever wakeful Tapers of the Skies, and let combustive flames purge this grosser world; O she's gone, the Beauties gone, now night and darkness cease me, and eternal slumbers seal my Eyes. Thus saying, he groand and smote his brest, pull'd off his hair, and in disiracted sort continued till Phaelice being admonished by Cupid in a dream, sent him more comsortable hopes of her ensuing favours. When Night had drawn her Curtain, and the world in silence sate, each mortal in sweet slumbers was reposed, Morbheus the Leaden god of sleep from his drowsy Coves, by Venus command, coused up his Visionary forms, the which in various shapes present themselves to men, and one of the Faries dressed in Cupid's wonted guise, with Bow and Quiver, armed, presents it to the fancy of the slumbering Phaelice, to whom the shade being instructed, thus began. Phaelice, behold I from the Queen of Love my beauteous Mother, come to present unto thee this Martial Here, and with that a shade all clad in Aemour appeared represen∣ting Guy so to the life, that she knew him at first, and started in her sleep, while thus the wing'd form proceeded: This is the man designed for thee, whose warlike deads shall make the world amazed; and to such Fame shall soon arise that Kings and Princes shall be proud to court him, whilst the terrour of his arm shall spread over greatest part of the Earth; a friend to the distressed, and the oppressors foe; Fortune shall wait on him, and Conquering Laurels still be green upon his brows; despise him not fair Virgin for his want of wealth, it is the treasure of the mind that makes a man truly great; for know, Beauty was at first treated free, e'r Gold was known or from the vowels of the Earth was brought to light, and since it has been in estimation, it has corrupied innocence, and Vertue spoiled, therefore is to be despised in case of Love, that intellectual Essence and bright jewel of the Soul; then as the powers above decree take him, for his manhood and
accomplished virtues think him worthy of your Love even at the highest rate, for it is most assured he is so. So said the Form, and Cupid that was not wanting in the enterprise drew up his Bow charged with a Golden shaft and aimed directly at Phaelice heart, the which no soo∣er done, but swift as Lightning slew the singing Arrow through the yielding air, and fixed its point direct, at which the startling Virgin waked, and wondred to find a fire so quickly kindled in her breast, so that contemplating on the Vision, she thus began to sigh her passion out. Alas and art thou gone thou winged power, what thange is this I feel, I that so late despised all Love, and laughed at Lovers pains, now feell a fever in my brest that wist consume me if it get not vent; can it be Guy that I must Love my Fathers Stewards Son that I denyed, must I now sue to him, perhaps now he will despise me for negle∣cting him, and triumph over my weakness: O Cupid are thy Laws then so severe? pardon my offence and sle hereafter grow more mild, and pitty Lovers in distress. While she was thus struggling with her flame Guy, having recovered his senses, re∣solved not to Retreat like a Coward, but Rally once more and try his Fortune, and af∣ter some search, having found her in her Chamber he thus begins. Most Beauteous, though severe, to you once more I have presumed to come, not as a Suitor now, but as a condemned Prisoner, desiring you to strike the fatal stroak, that can only set my soul at rest, for I have born my torture long enough; no Tirant Love I can endure no more; therefore sweet Lady in pitty to a wounded Lover, if any pitty lodges in that fair breast, strike deeper, yer at last, prove kind and ease my pain, so saying he sighed and tears burst from his warlike Eyes, not knowing that the powerful god of Love had mollified her heart and made her sensible of his command &c. The which Phaelice observing, began to blush, whilst in her fair cheeks the Roses Conquest over the Lillies gained; then fetching an undiscovered sigh began no followech. Alas you ask what is not mine to grant; know gentle youth I at my Father's disposal a, nor without him dare I consent to ought, for should I how prove disobedient, who so long have been obedient to his just Commands; what would the world of Phaelice say? each tongue would wound my Faine so deep that naught but death could yield relief; nor should I so escape, for in the silent grave they would asperse me, and fix Reproach upon my Comb: To which, thus answered Guy, Fair Lady, doubt not your Fathers free coneist, for with this arm I will so far purchase the good esteem of the Renowned Earl, that my marchless deeds, instend of Gold shall win his greatness to accept of me your humble slave for his obedient Son, so ended he, and she inflamed with Love, yet willing to hide it for a time, began; Go then and in fierce Arms your Fame advance, court breadful Battels while Victoria Crowins your head with her Triumphant Lam∣rels, and when laven with the spoils of War, or great Archievements, you returne
that I may safely yield without a stain to Honour, I shall be all your own, till then I shall remain in Virgin-state your constant Phaelice ever. At which Guy overjoyed, with humble thanks vowed low as Earth, and at last through the greess, his Language found a passage, while these words he uttered: bright Star, by whose divine influence my soul is guided and disposed; If feats of Arms, greatness in Battel gained, will please my Love, through seas of blood ile wade, climb to the highest Turret in Fames brazen Tower, and from thence look down upon the Coward world, with Gh for Caesar now, or the dread Conquerour of the East, I seell new force, and on a suddain am grown more then man, i'm all on fire till my great task's begun, and for a time I willingly forego thy beauteous face, which ne'rtheless shall be for ever stamped upon my soul; my Love farwel, to Arms I must repair, for this sweet Kiss that I imprint upon thy Corral lips, ile write thy name in Crimson Characters upon the breasts of Earths proud Champions, that when they see them they may think of thee. Again Farwel my Love, I must away To find the coast where Glory bates to day.

ren Leagues off from shoar but the Winds began to blow hard from the South West, and black Clouds overspread the face of Heaven, and laud thunders from the Northern round began to roar, so that in short time a dreadful storm arose, while slight∣ning darted thick, and made the Sea seem all on sire, the Waves incaged by the winds mounted high, and seem to mix with pitchy clouds, and bandied the Ship from side to side, so that they rode on furiously before the Gusts all that day and all the following night, not having so much as the prospect of Sun, Moon or Star, but early the next morning, the Marriners from the Top-mast-head descryed Land, to which, the winds being somewhat abated, they made; and about ten in the morning sound it to be Harflew in Normandy where they put in safe, after an hours continuance in the Port, Guy and the Captain of the Vessel went a shore to refresh themselves, where they had not long been, e'r they heard loud shouts, and the noise of Drums and Trumpets, the which was most acceptable to Guy, for now he thought there was some work for him in hand, whereupon he called his Host, and demanded the cause, who with countenance sad, which shewed a sense of grief, tosd him that a beauerous young Lady of that place, Do∣rinda by name, having been sately Ravished by one of the Duke de Biloys's Sons, the which black crime, four Russins were subborned to swear that the fact was done by some other person, and that she had confessed she only laid it upon the young Lord to i∣der his Marriage, in revenge for breaking his promise that she pretended he had made to her; upon which the old Duke grew so incensed, by reason his son was in a short time to be Married to the Printess of Parma; that he condemned her to he Burnt, unless any Champion would he so kind as to vindicate her innocence by fighting with her sour Accusers one after another; this News was welcome unto Guy, as hoping now to try his first Erperiment, so that turning from his Host to the Captain, he sold, Sir, I think this enterprize is worthy of an English sword, and that wronged Benuty ought not to be left thus, in distress; perhaps the Dukes power over-aws those that are wil∣ling to venture their lives in her behalf, and so the innocent must perish, whilst the Guilty shall go free: what say you Captain, said Guy, if I adventure to preserve her, truly said the Captian I think it a meritorious Exploit, could you abieve it with safe∣fy, but I hold it no wisdome to hazard your life for the sake of a stranger whom you ne∣ver saw; truly said Guy I lest my Native Soyl for that intent, my business is only to win Fame at the hazard of my Life my Fortune, to help the weak against the mighty, and to relieve those that appressing Tyrants crush: so saying, he gave order for his Hose and Arms strait to be brought on shore, so accoutring himself in his Warlike Habille∣ments he took leave of his Host and the Captain, who endeavoured all they could to perswade him from the Enterprize, but in vain; for having desired the Captain who
would willingly have accompanied him to await his return, he set spurs to his Horse and Riding to the place where his Host had directed him, he found a great concourse of people standing round in a Ring made by the Marshal so appointed, in the middle of which was fasned to a Stake the fair Derinda, and by her stood her weeping , on whom Guy fixing his eyes was moved to pitry, and more eager to vindicate her with his Arms, the which he had scarce time to think upon, before the Russins (who had ac∣cused the Lady) entered the List, well mounted and well Armed, proudly wheeling to the Right and Left, and then making a stand, one of them with a loud voice, dentan∣ded who among the Assembly there present it was that durst, in behalf of that base wa∣man, (pointing to the disconsolate Lady) enter the List, for sayes he, although the Dukes pleasure is that he shall Combate with us four, yet I alone stand ready to receive him on my Launces point, and in death make him repent the undertaking of a Strum∣pets cause, while these my companions have no work left to do: This made Guy storm, so that his countenance to terrour changed, whereupon he bid make way, and with an undaunted courage entring, thus spake: See here presumtious man, a Cham∣pion that dares vindicate this Lavies cause, and prove her innocent, not singly with one will I dispute, but with you all at once to have the sooner done; this so inraged the Frenchman that instantly he bid the signal Trumpet sound, at which both couched their Spears, and as swift as Lightning in the midway meet, whilst the hors  dring hoofs made earth beneath them tremble, Guy's Spear came plum upon  and through his Armour, and his shirt of Mail a passage found, and  tody rushed, so that down he fell, and with a groan expired; the other three seeing their Companion thus served, charged all three with desperate fury upon Guy's high-proofed Arms, vowing Rebenge, the which Guy not enduring long, drew out his Massy blade which like a Commer portendeth death and dismal fate, and after having brandishen it began to hew upon his Combatants so dreadfully, that at every blow their Armour (piecemeal) fell unto the ground, and afterwards their mingled limbs, so that two of them immediately fell dead, and the other wounded, on his knees begged life, confessing the whole intreague, how they had been hired to accuse the Lady, and that Philbertus the Dukes son was really guilty, and had hired them for 1000 Crowns to do what they had done, at which an universal shout arose each praysing and applauding Guy, and ac∣cusing the Duke, calling him Tyrant, each enquiring who the stranger was that had wrought so great a beliverance to the distressed Lady, and with all imaginable joy ex∣pressed their thanks; Guy being rid of his foes, went to the Lady and unbound her, and delivered her to her friends, who embraced his knees, and weeping for joy, implo∣red ten thousand blessings on his head, offering him Gold, Pearls and Diamonds, but he refused them all, and only desiring them to provide for the Ladies safety, by con∣veying her out of the Dukes power, least he being exasperated, upon his being informed
what had passed, should devise some other means to put her to death in his absence; so taking his leave he departed to the Ship, and there related what had hapned to his friends who with no little joy gave attention to what he said, yet after some consult, it was not thought safe to stay in that Harbour any longer, but wrighing their Anchors they set sail. CHAP. III. How Philbertus the young Duke having notice what Guy had done, pursued him by Sea and of a dreadful Fight that hapned between them, wherein the Duke and his men were taken Prisoners. PHilbertus having notice what had passed, how one Guy an English man had : three of his Champions, and mortally wounded the fourth, and that his treachery
was discovered, the Lady Dorinda freed and conveyed away he knew not where, it so inraged him that he quaked with ire, and vowed the bloodiest vengeance upon Guy that tortures could inflict, nor delayed he, but without his Fathers knowledge, caused his servants and attendants in number sixty, to Arm themselves, and strait wayes hasted to the Port where he had notice that Guy's Ship lay, but no sooner arriving there, but he understood that they set Sail some three hours before his coming, the which made him yet more eager, as thinking Guy fled for fent of him, and that Dorinda was by him conveyed away, so that going aboard a stout Vessel that lay in the Port aforesaid, he commanded to weigh Anchor, and make all the sail they could after the English ship, whom by a small Boat they understood was sailed to the Eastward; the Marriners obey∣ed, and having a fore wind and a swift sailor, in six hours space they came in sight of the ship wherein Guy was, which bearing but half her sails rode softly on; no sooner the French ship came in sight, but the Marriners advertised their Captain of it, who with a Prospective took an Observation, and assured Guy that they were pursued, and that their foes were trebble in number, telling him that the best way for their security was to hoist up all the sails, and if possible, to out-strip them, the which if they could do till Evening, he feared not but by the help of night to get clear of them; why said Guy, how many ships have us in chase, truly said the Captain I can discern but one, yet that one carries thrice the men on board her that we have; tis no matter said Guy, Captain be of god courage, I swear I would not for the Crown of France have it reported that Guy ever sled, no rack about and let us meet them like couragious English Soldiers, my self alone will bear the brunt of war, whilst you if you please may stand and see fair play; this speech so incouragrd the Seamen, that they cryed, let us engage them strait, and the Captain, now half ashamed was no less willing, so that they had no sooner put themselves into a posture, but the ship in which the French Lord was, bore up side by side, and without any more a do grapled with the English, which made Guy smile whilst like Mars he stood upon the Deck brandishing his dreadful sword; the French en∣deavoured to board the Vessel, which Guy gave order to permit without much difficulty, to that they thinking themselves vittorious, gave such a shout as made the Drean ring; nay now quoth Guy you have awakned me, look-to it, for this rudeness, some, or most of you shall sleep until the day of Doom; with that he began to lay about him with more then humane force, whilst Arms and Heads and dead men covered all the place whereon he ought, for against his Sword no Armour could defend, but at ruch blow fresh eams of blood ra down, Philbertus seeing such havk of his Souldiers made, or∣dered those few that were left alide to retreat if possible to his ship, and immediately en∣deavoured to ungrapple, which Guy (having cleared his Deck) perceiving, leap'd on Goard the French ship, and alone for half an hour maintained the sight with such sury that many of them leaped into the Sea, for to avoid his sword, the which Philbert see∣ing,
encouraged his men all he could, and as a man grown desperate with bespair, char∣ged on Guy's Helm with such force as made it sparkle fire, at which Guy no whit daun∣ted, but retuend him such a blow as made him fall for dead at his feet, which the Sol∣diers seeing, cryed for quarter, and threw down their Arms; Guy who was alwaies merciful to the submissive, bid cease the battle, in which space Philbert came to him∣self, and with a low submission begged his life, which Guy as freely granted; and af∣ter having transported him and the rest that were left alive into his own ship, he set fire to the other; and sailing onwards of his intended course, coasting the Compass till they touched on that part of Normandy that borders on the German Empire, where Guy, nothing daunted, Landed; the which no sooner done but he hears that a great Tilt and Tournament was to be held for Blaunch the Emperours Daughter, a most beauteous and accomplished Lady, and whosoever carried the day was to have the La∣dy in marriage, and with her, a brace of Grey hounds, a Faulcon, and a milk-white steed; upon this welcome News Guy discharged the Captain of the Vessel, leaving with him the Prisoners, who put them to their Ransome, and code to the place design∣ed for the noble strife. Where Honour bated, their his Arms to try And pluck a Plume from full fledg'd Victory.
CHAP. VI. How Guy worsted all the German Princes, and won fair Blanch the Emperous Daugh∣ter, who he afterwards left and departed for England. GUy having taken his leave of his old friend the Captain, rod to the place designed for the Stage of Fortune, and the winning of the beauteous Prise, to which, he was lead by the loud sound of the Trumpets, clarions Flutes, and all manner of Warlike Msick; where no sooner arriving, but he beheld the Plain filled with Horses and Chariots and Armed Knights, whose Coats of Arms & streamers of Gold play∣ed
with the winds, and their might Armour and glittering Spears, with the re∣flection of the Sun-beams, made the place seem all on flame; a glorious sight for to be∣hold, for most of the Christian Princes and Chavalours Knights were there assembled with their splendid Retinues, thinking the Prise well worth their strife, each being ambitious of the honour to be called the Emperours Son, and over and above to gain the fairest creature that they e'r beheld; Guy was no sooner setled in his station, but the Trumpets sound the Charge, whereupon Prince Philanus a German by birth entered the List on his proud steed, who champing his silver bit scarcely endured the Reins; against him Earl Spartianus came, and both touching their Launces as swift as Lightning met, and with such force, that the splinters of their broken Launces flew around their heads, then drawing out their glittering swords they furiously en∣gaged, till by a blow the Earl received on his Helm, his eyes grew dazy, and his sword dropped from his hand, himself down from his horse fell on the ground, which Guy seeing, grew impatient of delay, and setting spurrs so his bounding steed he came up to the Prince, now proud of his late success, and laying by their Spears, they charged upon each other with their swords, but ere they had exchanged many blows, Guy's trusty sword fell with redoubled force (much like a Thunderbolt) upon the Germans head, and breaking his Helm, bruised him so, that down he fell intran∣ced, and thence was carryed off for dead upon his Shield; to revenge which disgrace done to his friend, Otton the Great Duke of Tuscany proudly entred, vowing that Guy should perish by his hand, and no less then his life should be sufficient to appease his fury, at which Guy smiling, sustain'd his first charge without much resistance, but at the second met him with such a blow as cut quite through his Armour and his shirt of Mail, so that from the gaping wound the blood streamed fast: which the Duke eager of Revenge regarded not, till fainting he fell upon the ground; and had not his blood been stayed he there had bled his last: Duke Rainer next came forth and bid defiance unto Guy, saying, presumtious Knight this Lady must be mine, nor shall that Ar∣mour guard thy brest from death, since Armed with Love and powerful steel I fight, he had no sooner said, but Guy undaunted met him stroak for stroak, so that blows like hail fell thick and thundred on their Armour, till at last Guy's better blade wounded the Duke in his right shoulder, so that he could no more resist, but down his sole wea∣pon dropped; this prodigious vallour so amazed the spectators, that long they stood ga∣zing, not knowing what to think, while various discourses rumoured round, and the ignorant sort affirmed it was no man that fought, but some-spirit transform'd into a humane shape; the Combatants stood mute, not knowing what was best to do, till the Duke of Lorain burning with Emulation, pricked forward his proud steed, and coming towards Guy, said Sir Knight, to me unknown, whom Fortune has hitherto been pleased to favour, think not to bear these Trophies of honour hence, for they of
right belong to me, so saying, he couched his Launce, but Guy met it with his sword and at one blow cut it in sunder like a Reed, then charged upon the Duke, who strait began to stagger beneath the waight of his fierce Arms, making but weak resistance, so that at a fifth blow Guy broak his Helm and bruised him sore, at which he cryed for quarter, saying, hold dread Champion, for I yield; nor is there mortal power that can resist thy force, I will no more with thee contend for woman-kind, whose strength is so much more then man; I yield and do confess thou art my Conquerour: this said, his servants bore him thence. After this Havock made among the French and Ger∣man Peers, none durst approach the List nor talk of Comating with Guy, which the Emperour pereerving, sent a Knight for him, with whom Guy went, and humbly sa∣luted the Emperour and the fair Printess who sate under a Canopy of State on his right hand; to Guy the Emperour thus began. Renowned Knight, tell me what place was first made happy with the birth, for sure that Countrey must he proud of such a worthy man, to whom Guy made answer, May it please your Imperial Majesty, your faithful servant first in England drew his breath, England my Native Soyl, from whence I long have been detained in toiles of War; surely said the Emperour that place must he impregnable that has such a Bul∣work as thou for to defend it; great Alcides thou hast sure undone, & Hector's Arms could not with thine compare: thou ever hast deseeved my praise redoubted Knight, nor canthe breath of Majesty enough proclaim thy worth; take there the Virgin thou hast won, accept her though she is unworthy of so brave a man, and with her ask (except my Diadem) ought in my Empire, and sle freely grant; to whom Guy bowing low returned all humble thanks, and excused the praises that he breathed upon him, at which the Emperour gave Guy a Jewel and departed, leaving him and the beauteous Lody to discourse of Love alone; when Guy after due reverence done, addressed himself in this manner: Fair Angel, in whom Natures chief Perfections shine, on whom not without besert the has bestowed her choicest savours, most worthy to be abored and admired, command your servant to try his obedience, in whatsoever your Princely thoughts think fit, to which with a modest yet Majestick Grace the Princess thus re∣plied. Renowned Sir, these praises are not mine, tis I must serve you now, seeing your Sword hath won me, since such is my Fathers pleasure, therefore forbear these Ex∣rasies, least your words should make me blush and so betray the weakness of our loving Sex. At which Guy half o'rcome with Love, a while stood mute, and had been surely con∣queed by her prevailing eyes, had not his vows to Phaelice made, come fresh into his mine, whereat he reassumed his manly vertue, and drove assayling passions headlong ach, and after reollecting, thus he answers: Fair Lady, in whom is lively stampt
the Image of my Love, in thy fair face my Phaelice now appears, although my sword has purthased thee with wounds, pet all I can do is but to be your servant, for know, my hearte'r I beheld your beauty, in England was linked too fast for any separation, except by the Tyrant Death that Enemy to Love: I have, said he, a beauteous Lady, not unlike to you, to whom my vows are passed, never to be recalled, I had not thought that earth could have afforded such another, but in beholding your perfections I ac∣knowledge my mistake, for her I roam the world about, to search where Mars's Tents are spread, in bloody Battels and in Combats great and hazardous to venture all the slock of life that Nature lent me, so that if I through danger can escape, her promised Love is the fair Lawel that must crown my toyl, at which he ended. And the Princess fetching a deep sigh thus began, I see, said she, that Vallour dwells not in thy brest alone, but thereby Vertue Reigns, which makes thy worth the more; sure most happy must that Lady be to whom such vows are made, and your con∣stancy appears so just and sure, I shall not dare to break the sacred by of Oathes, that link your distant souls; though I could with — at which the stopt, and turning sighed, while blushes dyed her Rosy Cheeks, and all the Lillies were quite put to slight; then turning again, she said, most honourable man, here take these Jewels and presant her with them from me, who must enjoy a bliss I dare not think upon, Icast prevai∣ling passion should too great a Conquest gain over my frailty: so saving, she after having received Guy's humble thanks departed, the place not longer being able to surpress her Love. Guy after leave taken of the Emperour, to whom he made his Love to Phaelice known, and the cause of his undertaken-travels and hardships, was by the Emperours command attompansed to the Sea-side by all the Nobility of the Court, where imbar∣quing, he set Sail for England, as now hoping Phaelice would open her willing arm to receive the Hero that had bought her Love so dear. Where Landing, he as swift as Eagles fly Speed to behold the Center of his Joy.
CHAP. VII. How Guy at his Arrival was Received by Phaelice and all the Nobility, how he is sent forth again to seek new Adventures, but e'r he goes kills a monstrons Enchanted Cow upon Dunsmore Heath, and is Knighted by the King, and many favours bestowed up∣on him. Phaelice having received the News of Guy's Approch, and by the sound of Fame heard all the Warlike Deeds his hands had done, and the Chevalerous Exploits
(of which by this time England rung) she prepares to receive him at so pleasing a rate as might become his worth and Greatness, yet woman-like resolving to stifle as much as possible her powerful passion, thereby to make him the more sond & cager in the chase of Beauty. Guy now arrived at Warwick Castle, where he heard the price of all his toyl in dreadful battel there remained, who at the inward gare carrended by her Damzels) stood ready to receive him, whom Guy no sooner saw, but bowing low he thus Sa∣lutes. Fair Phaelice, from whom I have too long been absent, how thy bright face re∣freshes now my soul, and feasts my gazing Eyes, with beauty most transplendant, as when a long benighted travellour sucounded with dark terrours, in a pathless maze, from the Orient sky beholds the comfortable dawn of Light, which users in the Sun's refulgent beams so? to invest the drowsy world with day; for Madam in the midst of War, when Death was rageing round me, the thoughts of you inspird me with double force, and gave me victory in all attempts, so that finding no more to do, I am with joy returned, to claim the promise that you made, leaving the Beautiess that this Sword in bloody Combates won, nor could the Emperours Daughter (though divinely fait, and next your self, earths chiest Iem) entire my stay; her sighs had not the pawer to make me false though through a Sea of Princly blood I waided to obtain her, yet when obtained, I left her, for your sake, and only took these ledges that you see for the recompence of hazards run; then say my goddess wilt thou now grant me a sweet repose, in that loved bosome shall I rest from bloody Mars's toyles, and cout bright Venus in thy fairer Arms, speak for  would gladly know. To whom Phaelice blushing replyed, most Honourable man, of thy great Exploits I am no waies ignorant, Fame came before and told them, e'r you came I heard what havock you have made, and what great Prizes you have won; but yet me thinks those Beauties should ae been esteemed more by you then to be left for such trifles, But I know your answer will be, you did it for my sake, tis sure it was so, I believe as much, and will reward your constancy with Love, a Love as boundless as the O∣ean, and chast as those bright fires that shine by night: but to be plain I will un∣fold a secret Vision that so me appeared, when I was cruel, and returned disdain for Love: In the midst of slumber, Cupid from his Cristal Mansion did descend, pre∣senting to my view a Martial Here much resembling your fell, commanding me to Love you for your great Renown and matchless Might, saying, the rerrour of the Nations shall he be famed to all Posterity, Kings shall be proud to court him, and great Monarchs tremble at his frown, so saying he let fly from his bended Bow a glitte∣ring Shaft, that xed in my Brest, at which, awaking I sound the kindled flame
burn bright; but though I love thee dear, yet for my Honours sake, must not con∣sent to Wed, till thy victorious brow be wreathed with more Lawrels, and when thou shalt return once more triumphant, then is Phaelice thine, and toilsome War shall tease. Then said Guy. I must not yet discharge my servant Death, he must again with me, while from the terrour of this Arm each mortal slies, and Armies fall before me like Autumnal leaves when the rossing branches are assailed by gusty winds; come my bright goddess, as I stand within these walls of steel, incircle me in thy fair arms and cheer my soul with one sofe Kiss, and e'r I do return, i'i send my Trophies home by Fame; thy longing ears shall hear of such great Actions done, as shall make thee conclude thy servant worthy of thy Love. Be constant, fairest creatures, and think upon the faithful Guy, who in the midst of Arms and death will never fail to think on thee, that so at my return, Hymeneal joyes and the possession of thy lovely bed shall crown my distant toyl in War; now look to it ye Champions of the world, Princes and Potentates, for Guy once more must wanter 'r the Globe to seek Adven∣tures out: so saying, he kissed her, and departed to take his leave of the most Noble Earl, whilst she with eyes brimful of tears withdrew to her Retirement, often ac∣culing her self for pushing him forwards on such hazardous designs, and yet ambitious of his gaining Honour, and so between willing and unwilling, she left him to his fortunate adventures. Whilst Guy unto Earl Robands goes, who received him with more joy then can be well expressed, and orders a Feast to be made in honour of his new come Guest, inviting most of the Gentry thereabouts, who hearing of Guy's Arrival in England, and that he was to be presant there, they came gladly, as being much desirous to see him after so many great Exploits, the Entertainment was very sumptuous, being ac∣commodated with all manner of Musick, and what else had power for to delight the sences. Which ended, Guy following the Earl into his Retirement, told him that he came to take his leave of his Honour, and that he had made a vow to Heaven the which he burst not violate, once more to try his Fortunes in Countries abroad, because this my Native Land affords no great Exploits worthy to be Registred by Fame: thus he said, but would not make the Earl acquainted with his Love, nor that his Daughter had enjoyned the Enterprizes he designed to make, who endeavoured all he could to perswade him to the contrary, laying before him the many hazards that must needs at∣tend, and what dire mishaps in such daring attemps must needs befal; at which Guy no waies daunted was the niore earnest to depart, saying, he could not confine himself to Ease, but for the honour of his Country would spend some daies in War, and try the various moods of Fortune and of Fate, to learn for to contemn them both, and that
his mind still prompted him to great designs, the god of Battle at his Nativity being Lord of the Assendant. The Earl seeing his perswasions could no wares work on him to stay, dismissed him, upon promise at his return he would abroad no more, but live at home with him; Guy's Father and Mother, bathed in Tears, likewise besought his stay, but all in vain; for nothing but dread Arms and sounds of War wire pleasing to is ears; all things be∣ing in readiness for his departure he embarqued for France again, to seek out new ad∣dentures, nothing fearing, though he knew that he had many there who would (it pos∣sible) by strength or fraud, surprize his Life, but before the Master of the Vessel could get clear of the Lands end, the wind turn'd about, and rising somewhat strong, forced them back into the Harbour, where they lay unknown to the people of the place who they were, then was Guy's Vessel wind-bound six daies, in which space Fame had noised through every corner of the Land, how that a dreadful and monstrous Beast, for∣med by Majick skill into the likeness of a Cow, or rather a Cow of vast bulk possessed by some tempestuous spirit did terrify the neighbouring Plains destroying the Cattle round about, and putting all their Keepers unto flight, being so strong and swift in mo∣tion, that it was thought no humane force could have destroy'd it; the monstrous descrip∣tion of her as followeth, is affirmed by Authors of great integrity and worth, that she was four yards in height, six in length, and had a head proportionable, armed with two sharp hornes growing direct, with Eyes all red and fiery, which scented to dart Light∣ning from afar, she being of a Dun colour, from whence she was named the Dun Cow and the place not many miles distant from Warwick, where she haunted; from that Monster took the name of Dunsmore Heath, which name it keeps unto this day, &c. Upon the notice the King had at York (where he then was) of the havock and slaugh∣ter this beast had made, he offered Knighthood and several other Gifts of great worth to any that would venture his life in that encounter, but the terrour of her sierceness had spread st self in such a dreadful shape, that none durst undertake the enterprize, but each one wishing sor Guy whom all supposed by this time in France; glad of this opportunity, he leaves the ship, and having changed his Armour to avoid being known, he takes a strong battle Ax his Bow and Quiver with him, and so incognito riding to the place where this Monster used to lodge, which was among a great thicket of trees that grew upon the Plain, near to a Poole or standing water finding as he had passed along all the shepherds Cottages deserted, and the Carcasses of men and beasts ly scattered round about; he no sooner came within bow shot of the place but the Monster espyed him, and putting out her head through the thicket, with dreadful eyes glared on him, and be∣gan to roar horribly, at which Guy who was one of the expectest Archers England then had, bent his Bow of Steel, and drawing and Arrow to the head let fly, the which as swift as Lightning, striking on the Monstr's hide rebounded as from a wall of Ada∣mant,
not making the least impression, at which, whilst Guy was wondring, out she rame with such speed as seemed rather through the air then on the earth, and at him aimed directly her sharp pointed horns, which he observing, lifted his Ax on high and smore her on the front with such a blow as made her to recoyl; at which she more enra∣ged came on again, and clapping her horus unto his breast, dinted his high proofed Ar∣mour e'r he could avoid her, but wheeling his warlike hore unto the right he met her again, and with a redoubled stroke gave her a wound under the ear which was the only place she was sensible of being wounded in, whereat she roared aloud, and stamped the ground, Guy perceiving she was mortal, followed that stroke with another no less for∣cible, at which she fell to the ground, and Guy alighting hewed upon her so long that through her impenitrable skin he battered her skull, till with a horrid groan she there expired, where, leaving her sweltred in a stream of blood, he rode to the next inhabited Village, where he made known the Monsters death, to the unspeakable joy of all that heard it, the poor people honourng him with presants and thanks more then can here be told, thousands from all parts flocking to behold that Monster dead, whom alive they so much feared: long it was not e'r the King had notice of it, who sent for Guy to York, where he no sooner arrived, but the King embraced him in his arms, and after a splen∣did entertainment he gave him the order of Knighthood, with many other rich gifts, tausing one of the Ribs of the said Monster to be hanged up in Warwick Castle, of which more hereafter, for now we must leave England and follow Guy into France. Where he such deeds in Arms did foon atchieve That they may stagger most for to beleive.
CHAP. VIII. How Guy Herauld, and two other Knights were set upon by sixteen Villains that lay in wait for him in a Wood, whom he destroyed, they first having Kill'd two of his Knights afterwards assisting the Duke of Lovain who was besieged by the Duke of Lorain, he routed Lorain's Armies with great slaughter, and afterwards confirms a Peace between them. GUy haveing with much adoe got leave of the King to depart the Court, secret∣ly took ship again, without the knowledge of Earl Robands, or his beauteous
Mistriss (who now doubtless would have been contented to have opened her willing Arms) so that with three Rnights more, (viz. Sr. Herauld, Sr. Edfrid, and Sr. Martis, who had entered into strictest Friendship with him, vowing to live and dye in adventuring for his sake;) He landed after two dayes Sail in France, where in search of Warlike business they crossed the Country, but finding no enterprizes worthy of their swords, they bent cowards the Emperours Court, where Guy doubted not but to imploy his Arm, and gain the Fame he thirsted for, but the gerat Duke of Tuscany, Orion by name, hearing of Guy's approach, supposed he came to deprive him of fair Blanch the Emperours daughter, into whose Favour nce Guy's departure) he had insinuated himself, many wayes excusing the foils he received by the English Knight, and therepon picking sixteen of the best and stourest Souldiers he had in his Castle, he gave them Order to Arm themselves and lye in Ambush in the Wood, near to the Road where Guy must pass, be-before he could come to the Court; and as soon as they see him, to fall upon him, and after they had killed him; to bury him in the Wood, that so the Fact might not be known. To this command of their Lord they Redily consent, not knowing what man er of man they had to deal with, so that placeing themselves behind a thicket of Trees, they had not long waited before they saw Guy and the other three come rideing toards them, regardless of any such Treathery; no sooner was they within Reach, but the Russians durst from their Ambuscade and charged upon the English Heroe's; Crying, Kill, kill, at which Guy and his three trusty Knights began to wonder what it meant, but long they wondered not, before they drew their Glistering stoords, Courage said Guy my Friends, these Villains shall pay dear for this affront, with that he frowned with such a look, as when the Skyer over cast with black Clouds, portend dread Storms and Tempest through the devious Ait, and then let y with such force, and rage, as all that his Sword touched fell, slain or wounded, on the Earth, Armour all in pieces, cut Helms, and Helmed Heads lay scattered on the place, so dreadfully he layed about, that in short space ren of them lay breathless, but casting round his Eyes, he saw the remaining six had so fiercely combated his three companions, that two of them were slain, and Sr. Herauld all besmeered with blood, which flowed from Gapeing wounds at which Guy thus expressed his Ice; Villains whose lives fate has designed a sacrifice to my revenge, let the Knight rest and combate me, what do my Eyes behold two of my dear Friends (who left their Native Land for to accompany me) silenced by Death, and the third more dear then they, mortally wounded. This Villaines is the last vile Acts your hanvs shall ever do, with that he charged upon
them with such force as for exceeded Hercules when he the Centaures flew, and in short space cut five of them in pieces the sixth upon his knees begged life, and did confess who had imployed them, and to what intent, whereupon Guy withheld his dreadful Arm, but it was too late, for the miserable man only lived to tell the treathery, and dyed, thorough his Excessive Wounds; after which Guy not unmindful of his murthered and wounded Knights, went to a Hermits Cave not far distant thence, and gave him order for to bury the two slain, and to take in Herauld into his charge, and care, laying a grievous curse upon him if he medled with the Rest, and so departed (after leave taken) through the Sollitary Grove, bewailing much the Loss of his dear Friends, yet not declining Honours search, no sonner had he passed the thick shades, but from a rising hill he beheld a fair and Goodly City, before which on a plain were many armed Knights assembled to just at Tilt and Turnanent, the which somewhat Revived his spirits, as well hoping to find Duke Orion there, and so revenge on him the Treachery, but he was not at that time so fortunate, for the Duke, by his Scouts, having notice of the death of his men, and that Guy was approaching, he feigned a suddain sick∣ness and so withdrew from Court; Guy being arrived, thrust in among the thickest Ranks to seek the man he so much longed to combate with, but not finding him, he challenged all there presant, and after having foiled the best that durst encounter him, and wone the prize, he departed with great applause to the Duke of Millaines's Court: where no sooner arrived, but the Duke embrated him in his Arms, and prepared a sumptuous entertainment for him. Long he had not rested there, before he understood that the Duke of Lovain to whom Guy had sworn Friendship, was besieged by Lorains power; whereupon Guy taking leave hasted to help his Friend, as he was rideing over a Moory Plain he met a Pilgrim, as he supposed, all Clad in Gray, who seemed faint with Travell, whom he kindly saluted and entreats for to acquaint him with some News—News said the Pilgrim, and with that he fetched a sigh, Alass sir, 'tis a thing I now am no wayes conversant with, but have renounc'd the world and all its business, since I have lost my dearest Friend, and on his searth have travailed, and must travail with many weary steps, for till I sind him, my soul can take no rest, I pitty thee said Guy, but pray be so kind as to deelare the man, perhaps I may inform you for 'tis sure that I should know that voice, Alass said he, it is a man renowned in arms through all the spaeious world, one for whose sake I left my Native land and one who saved my lift from cruel Foes, with that Guy understood that it was Herauld nor could conceal himself, but pulling up his Vizage, discovered his sate, and immediately allighting embraced him while he wept for joy, Expressing
these words, and has kind Heaven been so propitious as to restore thy life whom I supposed dead: behold me Herauld I am he you sought, henceforth let cares be ba∣nished from this brest, my only request is now to know how your wounds were cured, to whom thus Herauld replyed with his Eyes o're flowed with tears of joy, Oh how can it be, am I thus unlooked for made so happy, then know worthy Guy, the Hermit with whom you left me in charge, after having conducted me faint as I was to his Cave, poured Balsoms into my wounds, and with soveraign Cordialls refreshed my Fadeing Spirits. So that after some continuance in his Cave, I gathered strength, but could not he contented in my mind, for loss of you, which restlessness the good old Hermit perceiving, was very inquisitive to know the cause, which I as freely declared, upon which he delivered me this Gown to cover my Armour: that so I might the more seturely Travail in thy search, the which has now happily been successful, so spake Herauld, and Guy with joy again embraced him, and thanked him for his Love and Friendship, causing him to mount behind him, and so they Rode discoursing of their Various adventures, till they came to the beleaguered City, and breaking through the Hostill ranks of foes, came to the Gate where they soon found entrance, the Duke no sooner hearing that Guy was come unto his Aid, but he came and humbly saluted him, bidding him ten thousand welcomes, and each drooping souldier was revived at his Name; Crying, Lead on, Lead on, and let us sally out and charge the Foe, the Duke laying hold on this opportunity thought it not convenient to let their courages coole, gave order to his Commanders to prepare for the Battell, and that on pain of death they should be obedient unto whatsoever Guy should think fit; this being done, the Gates were opened, and the Souldiers with such a shout that Echoed through the Skies, Issued out, and charged the Foe with such bravery and courage, that they with much slaughter, forced them to Retreat, broken and in great confusion; Guy and Herauld persuing them even to their Camp, cutting their way through Armed Squadrons, and putting them to the rout, far and near, whilst all the blushing plaines lay strewed with dead and dying men, so that Guy in compassion unto Christian lives, vid spare the sword, and stayed the Souldiers fury, making slaughter cease. This overthrow so vered the Duke of Lorain so sore, that he immediately vowed revenge, giving order that all the Millitia of his Dukedome should immediately march to retrue his broken Army, so that within ten dayes he sayed siege again, with Thirty thousand Horse and Foot, vowing not to leave the City till they had layed it as low as Earth, and thereupon begirt it with his Souldiers round, Resolving so by curting off communication, to force it to a surrender, for want of
provision, but the Stratagem prevailed not, for Guy and the Duke from the walls observing their intention, the better to disencourage them in that point; like Manlius the Roman General, when besieged by the Gailisenes, in the Cappital, gave order to throw provision in abundance down, tsting the Enemy that if they wanted more, upon request they might be furnished, for id Guy I would not starve my for, least when o∣verthrown in bat he should excuse his weakness for want of food; but now you have provision feast your elves that I may find you more resolure in war then heretofore I have done, fore'r the sun deseends into the Western Deean, dreadful slaughter again shall rage through all the bloody field: this said he gave order to his Soldiers for to Arm while Drums and Trumpets roused their drousy courages; then leading forth ten thou∣sand of the most exerte in three bands, the first Commanded by himself, the second by the Duke, and the third by Herauld, the two first, each consisting of three thousand foot and one thousand horse, and the last of two thousand foot only. With these embatteled Forces Guy marching in the Van, charged the Germans in the Front, and with his word cut a passage for his squadrons through their pointed Ranks, that shivered Spears flew cound his head like hail; while this was doing, the Duke and Herauld charged on the right and the left of the Enemy with such courage and bravery, that the Germans finding themselves assaulted on all sides, endeavoured to fly, and had left their Duke to shift for his safety amidst his fors, had not pure shame restrai∣ned, Guy observing how they fell into disorder and began to shink together, pressed them the more, and having made a wide gap with infinite slaughter of his foes, at last came where the Duke of Lorain fought, who no sooner beheld all smeered with blood and what havock he had made, but by retreating amongst his own Squadrons of horse he thought sit to avoid his sury; and finding shortly after that the battle went against him, he caused a Retreat to be sounded, so that in much confusion he withdrew, leaving about ten thousand of his men dead upon the place, whiles Guy and the Lovanians char∣ged upon the flying remains, tist they stiled the ditches and fields with the slain and wounded, even till Guy out of compassion stayed the souldiers from pursuing, and with the spoil of the Enemies Camp marthed hack in trumph to the town, where Guy was received under a Canopy, and a Trophy raised in memory of his matchless valour as their chief deliverer. After the Ceremonies were overpast, Guy taking the Duke into a private retirement, demanded of him, that if after this victory he would make a League of amity with Lo∣rain, to which he joyfully replyed, he was content; why then said, Guy, I shall he more proud to establish a firm friendship between two such potentates, than in innumerable victories, for I hold it not convenient for Christians to war with Christians, and must each other to glut the jaws of slaughter; but that we rather unite our fores and dend
our Arms against the raging Infidels who now tiranize over the Eastern world, late by Vsurpation taken from the Roman Empire: Sir, replyed the Duke, if you will fa∣vour me so far as to conclude this friendly League, what ever you shall propose I wil∣lingly will sign unto, Guy thanked the Duke, and with a thousand Armed men marched towards the hill where the Loranians broken forces lay Encamped or rather scattered, and no sooner coming to the foot of the said Hill but he sounded a Parley, at which the Duke sent down his Lieutenant General to know the cause; to whom Guy ade known his undertaking, and withal desired a personal Treaty with the Duke, giving him to understand who he was; this being no sooner known, but the Duke mounted, and at∣tended by some of his choice Commanders, came riding down towards the Plain, the which Guy no sooner perceiving, but giving order to his men to stand in battel ar∣ray, he set spurrs to his horse and hasted to meet him, and in the midway they alighting embraced each other, after which Guy thus began. Great Prince against whom (in our own defence) we fought, and heaven favouring the righteous cause, commanded Victory to attend us, which has adorned our Conquo∣ring Arms with spoiles, yet forgetting & laying aside all farther enmity or Quarrels, I from Lovains Great Duke, here bring you terms of Peace, for why should Christi∣ans war, and Christians Arms shed Christians blood? then let it be no longer so, great Sir, embrace our offered friendship, and no more let us be foes; we impose no difficul∣ties as Conquerors use, but desire for to embrace with equal Arms: what though your Nephew was by accident slain, as the Duke himself confesses much against his will, which was the cause begat this war, your Highness must forget it; nay moreover when you consider that thirty thousand lives have made sufficient Attonement to his silent Ghost, let us henceforth war against the Pagan powers, to drive them back to their distant Asia, and rid Europe of such a curb, so said Heroick Guy, to whom the Duke replyed. Most honoured man, whose force in Arms no mortal can resist, though I am much grieved for my Nephews death, by Segwins hand bereaved of life, and more for these shameful overthrows, yet at thy request it shall be Peace, and hence forth horrid war in Janus Temple shall be locked up fast, whilst bound in chains on impious arms she sits complaining, with a hundred bloody mourhs: Go worthy English man, go tell my Brother, for now enmity is banished, that's the name that a Royal Tent shall on this Plain be pitched, in which an everlasting Peace shall be concluded for thy sake, upon which, Guy thanked the Duke, and returning to the City, declared to Segwin what had passed, who embraced Guy and payed his labour with rich presants and a thousand thanks, and then issuing out in pompous attire, attended by all his Nobles, Guy being pla∣ced in his Chariot on the right and Herauld on his left, they drove to the Tent or Pavil∣lion
of State where Sigbert Duke of Lorain in splended Equipage attend their coming, where allighting they embraced each other with such fervecy, as if enmity had  a stranger to them, and sumpruously feasted each other for the space of six dayes, so that the noise of war was turned into Ioy and delight, caused by all manner of noble pastime, and at last friendship so far prevaied, that at the earnest reanest of Guy, Duke Sigbert of Lorain gave Segwin Duke of Lovain his eldest daughter fair Miranda in Marriage, which doubly crowned the joy on all sides, the which being somewhat abated, Guy im∣patient of ease, requested forces of the oon Dukes to go against the Sarazens, who had then broke in upon the Greek Empire, and laid great part of it wast, to which moon they were very unwilling to condescend, desiring him out of all love to stay with them, and not to hazard himself in such dangerous enterprizes, but they finding him to persist in his resolution, and that they in vain perswaded him to the contrary, entreated him to draw out what Forces he thought sufficient, and that they would furnish them with all things convenient for the war, at which Grant Guy returned them thanks, assuring them that he would so employ them to the honour of Christendome, that after Ages should wonder at their prowess; and thereupon he selected two thousand of the choicest soldiers presant, one of Loranians and the other Lovanians, who were willinger to goe under his command then can be imagined, so he having Embarqued them upon ten ships of war took his leave of the two Dukes, with promise to visit them at his return, and bring them such Trophies as the fortunes of war should deal him, whereupon they accompani∣ed him to the shoar, and departed not thence till his ships were quite sailed out of sight. So much he honoured was where e'r he came And looked upon as the Eldest son of Fame.
CHAP. IX. How Guy being furnished with two thousand men and ten Ships of War, marched to the Relief of Bizantum, then besieged by the Turks and Zarazens, and being scattered from the rest of his Fleet, is set upon by 3 Pirates, two which he destroys, and forces the third to fly, Relieves the City, kills many of the Pagan Champions, and in his Return fights with a fiery Dragon and kills him. AFter a months sailing Guy having coasted Italy, and entered sat into the Mediterranian Sea, where by a Levant Wind being seperated above two leagues
from the rest of his Fleet, he was set upon by three Turks men of War belonging to Sally, who supposing him a Prize, and that his ship was led with rich Marchandise, came boldly up and endeavoured to board him, which Guy perceiving smiled disdainfully, and with many Heroick Expressions encouraging his men; he drew his flameing Sword, so drendfully known in War, and charged upon the assailing infidells with such fury, that all he reached glutted the gapeing jaws of death, cutting their shrouds, Tarkell, and all other their Engins in pieces like a twine thread, whilst Herauld and the rest were not idle on the other side, for having prepared Pitch, Hems, Tarr, and Rossin, they set it on fire, and with a certain Engin threw it into the Turks ship that engaged them, on that side (a Stratagem till then unknown) which catching hold on the Decks, Masts, and Rigging, blazed into a horrid flame which seemed to curle amongst the clauds, the which they being no wayes able to extinguish, with a dreadful cry forsook the burning ruined and leaped into the Ocean where many of them perished, which the other two ships seeing, hoisted up all their sails and endeavoured to fly, which one of them effected, but Guy having close grapied with the other was leaped on board her, and there made such slaughter that all the Decks were covered with the slain, which so amazed the Turks that they cryed aloud to Mahomet to come and save them from the devils that fought against them, but their prayers were in vain, till Guy out of compassion spared their lives, and putting forty of his men on board, sent them with the remaining prisoners to his Friend the Duke as the first fruits of his Atchievements; no sooner was this engagement ended, but all his ships came up with him, who by reason of a Fogg mistook their way, so that Night coming on, Guy commaned them to stand off to the South-East, and sail gently till Morning for fear of running foule upon the Rocks that are too frequent in those parts, hid under Water, near to the shoares, &c. No sooner the ensuing morning had the Sun sent forth his Orient Beams, but from his Deck Guy viewed the Coast, and from affar beheld a City besieged, and heard the murmour of their shouts to vollue through the Air, much like the sound of thunder almost spent, whereupon he ordered his Pilot to fathom for the next convenient landing place; which being found, he put in, and sent Sr. Herauld with two more Captains to understand if possible who the besieged and the bessegers were, which message they as willingly undertook, and after about five houres stay, return'd with this following account, which they learnt from a stragling Turk (whom they also brought with them as their Prisoner) that it was Bizantium made famous by the honours done to it by Constantine the Great, and late the Metrapollitane City of the Greek Empire, and that the Souldan of Babylon
with thirty thousand men layed siege against it, his forces for the most part consisting of Turks and Saraens, and that the siege had continued with much slaughter on both sides for the space of three months, the City being defended by a number of Christians, under the command of Albertus a Noble Saxon. This was not a little pleasing to Guy who had now met with a fair opportunity of making his valour known, so that immediately he sent Herauld and one Knight more to the Lord Albertus to acquaint him that he lay in the Port with two thousand Christians under his command, and that if he wd in the Evening open the Gates that looked to the Seaward, he would fight his way through the Foes and enter the City; Herauld and the other Knight undertake the Embassy, and in Turks habit having or the watchward of the Prioner, they passed the Guards, and being come to the gate knocked aloud, and no sooner declaring that their Message was to Albertus but the Porter opening the Wicker gave them Entrance, when strait they were conducted to the Castle where the General and his chief commanders were assembled in a Counsel of War, to whom after reverence done, they made known the cause of their coming; at the first mention of which Albertus and the rest were somewhat doubtful seast it might be some treacherous design to win the Town, but when these Letter of credence under Guy's hand and Seale were produced, they stood no longer pausing but recared them with all imaginable kindness; saying, that they would not only open the gate at the hour appointed, but likewise at the same time sally out upon the Foe to make his entrance more easie and so dismissed them with many expressions of joy: the time being come Guy landed his men as silently as possible, and drawing them up in Battalia upon the shore, gave order to those that remained in the ships to stand off to Sea, till he signified to them his farther pleasure by an appointed sign, which accordingly being done, he marched towards the City, but e're he could gain entrance, the Enemy took the Allarum, so that Arm, arm, they cryed throughout, they came and drew up from every quarter, which Guy perceiving held it no time to dally, but heartning his Souldiers, with testing them the uprightness of their sacred cause, he bid sound  charge, ordering his men to keep together in a Body, he draws his Sword which by Moon-light reflected like a Comet in the Air, the rest soon imitated him, and giving a great shout the which was answered from the Town, they fell upon the Foes with such undaunted fury that they bore down all before them, whilst Leggs, cadg, broken Armes, and mangled shirts of Mail belleewed the Crimson plain, Guy forceing himself, with redoubled strength the better to give his followers incouragement, had made such slaughter where he fought, that the slain like ramparts hemmed him in, the dpure continued exceeding sharp for the space of two hours,
so that what were slain by Guy and the fifteen hundred men he brought on shoat with him (the rest being left to man the ships) and by three thou and who ar the same instant sallyed from the Town, and charged them in the Rear, there perished of the Mahomitans no less then Forry thousand, so that finding themselves worsted on all sides, the in much disorder and confusion retreated to their Camp, the which when the Souldian heard, he vowed revenge, and gave orders for assaulting the City as soon as day appeared, it being then Night Guy suffered their retreat as not thinking it convenient to persue them, he with his Souldiers entered the Town, and were most joyfully received, and the hurt men lookt m with all diligence, Albertus embracing Guy, condued him to his own lodging, and there seasted him as well as the place could afford, and ordered the same should be done to all his Souidiers paing away most part of the night in various discour s conning the assaies of the War, and what had happened since the first beginning of the siege. Next morning as soon as d light appeared, the Souldian commanded the Captain of his Army to prepare for the assault, ordering the Drums to bear and the Trumpers to ound, at which the Pagans gave such a shout as made the ills resound the Eccho back, which Roued Guy from his slumber, who starting up, instantly ascended the Tower, and from thence beheld an innumerable Host of Infidells marching towards the Walls with sealeing Engins; whereupon he gave order to Herauld to get his men in readyness who cacefull obeyed his command, then turning to Albertus, he said, sir, It behoves us this day for the honour of Christendom to make a brave defence, in my opinion 'tis most sit to meet those daring incschers on yon plain, and there to give them battel e're they can reach our Walls, so that may be a means to check their pride, Victory has stood for us you see already, which will much animate our Souldiers on, and disencourage our Foes, and ser me ell you she never turn'd against me yet, nor sailed to pearch upon my Arms and savour me in all my hold attempts, follow Guy and fear not but Guy's fortunes will attend you; so said the Warlike Hero of whose high courage Albertus much appraved cendering thanks to Heaven for sending such a Champion to defend the Town, long, they pared not, because the Enemy was at hand, but inging open the Gate, sallyed our with twelve thousand men at Arms to mae them according as Guy had propsed, he with his Germans marching in the From, is great Standard being a Lyon Rampant; no sooner the Enemy beheld them  march towards them who nor in the least expected any such thing, but they made a hair, and throwing down their sealeing Engins put themselves in Battalia, the which Guy perceiving gave order to his Archers that were in the Front to
egin the Battell, who drawing their bows fent a shower of Arrows amongst them, which galled the Turkish Horse and forced them into disorder, whereupon Guy and Herauld broke into the main body, and killing or wounding all that opposed them began a dreadful sight, so that the Germaines following close after them, still pressed them to the right and the left with short of Arrows, the which struck no small terrour to the infidells the Bizantines under the command of Albeitus imitating them in a short time put the Enemies left wing to the Rout whilst Guy fought in the main body, hewing his bloody way whiles death macked his Eyes, and whereso e're they aimed he flew, nothing but rout and run inclosed him round whilst Heaps of Slain lay like a Wall on either hand, fighting on untill he came unto the Squadron that was led by Colbron Lieutenant General of the Horse, he being newly come to the Battel began to wonder when he saw what havock Guy had made, and how his Armes were all besmeered with blood, and staring with broad and siery eyes, he vowed reverge wearing to sacrifice Guy's life unto his Pagan Gods, this Monster of a man being ten foot high and seven in circuit bearing a weighty spear, and such a sword as no man in the Pagan Army (himself excepted) could undertake to weild, so that pressing forwards confronted Guy, crying aloud, Uile, Christian most odious, to my sight hold thy murthering hand and let us two each others weapon try, for e're we part I mean to sacrisice thee to the Ghost of my dear Friends whom thou hast slain, at which Guy fixing his Eyes upon him smiled, saying, thou art the only man I long have sought, therefore let us lose no time. With that they charged upon each other with such fury, that from rarling Ar∣mour the blows like thunder eccho'd, whilst either side sent shouts up to the Skies, Guy having born the brunt of the battel all that day, the Pagans doubted not but that their Champion would prevail, by reason of his monstrous size and strength, having been often tryed in dreadful Combaes, but they were mistaken, for Guy re∣doubling his strength, cut through his high proofed Armour, making such wide wounds, that made him roar like the enraged Sea, when boundins from a hollow Rock, and endeavours to retire, but Guy pursuing him with one full stroak, cut through his Helm so deep into his head, that down he fell in deaths Convulsions on the crimson Earth. At this the Pagans all amazed shrunk together, till Elmadant a fierce Sarazen charging formost encounred Herauld, who sought on the left, but long they had not engaged e'r he followed his Giantick Brother to the shades beneath. Morgadner another Collonel, monstrous for size, desperately engaged with Guy, having in his hand a battel Ax, which weighted about one hundred weight, with
which he slew several of Guy's men before he could come on that side where Guy fought, but Guy no sooner encountred him, but th his sword ut off his right arm, when falling down, and the loss of blood he was traden to death among the croud, be∣ing unable to relieve himself: Thus the Battel going against them, the Pagans on all sides fled, nor could the Souldian by his General possibly stay them being pursued by Guy and the Brizantines, the slain fell down by the way, to the number of twenty thousand, such havock made they of those Insidels, at which the Souldian storming & cursing his gods, gave order to recollect his broaken Troops, to hazard nce more the chance of War, and begin the battel, but all in vain, for the Soldiers dreading Guy far worse than death were fled into the woods and Marshy grounds without regard to their Coummanders, at which the Souldian was so much intaged, that whilst Guy was tabing the spoil, he sent a Chalenge to him demanding single combate with h to: end the business of the War, which message Guy most joyfully received; and all things being in rediness, they met with such fury as made the Earth to quake, the Souldian. being inraged by despair, and Guy couragious for the honour of Christendome, laid o him such irresistable blows, as made his gilded Armor fly like glass, and yield a pas∣sage to mortals wound that followed thick, so that with one blow on the left side that entred his heart he fell down, breathing out his soul in curses loud: this, Eskeldath  bloody and tyrannick Turkish Prince beholding, vowed revenge, and coming up to Guy defied him with disdaine, cursing him by all his gods, swearing he had vowed his head unto his Mistress, and would hear it unto her on hi Launce; hast thou so quoth Guy and drawing out his bloody sword, said, pray take it if thy courage will but let thee dare, least the Lady think you did promise more then you are able to perform, and then perhaps you lose her favour: this no sooner spoak, but they charged upon each other, that fire sprang out of their Helms like Lightning slashes, till the Pagan being wounded deep into the arm, let fall his sword, and thinking it no time for ta∣king of it up, he set spurs to his horse and fled to the woods amain. After this Routand the plunder of the field taken, Guy returns victorious to the City, where he was received with all the pomp that can be possibly conceived, whilst as he rode through the streets, the people from the houses tops, and windows, threw down Garlands before him, and strewed him with slowers, crying, Long live the Re∣nowned English Champion, our happy deliverer, and aftewards set up his Starue in the Market place, adorned with the Enemies spoyl, the which was since destroyed by the Turks; Guy having staid there with Albertus about ten days, was desirous to depart and to return to England, so that leaving one thousand of his men with Albertus for the guard of the City, he embarqued with the rest, and sailed back for Germany, but one day putting in to Harbour to refresh; Guy and Herau'd wnt on ar, and being
much taken with the plesantness of the Forrest that bordered on the Sea, they entred the same to see if they could find any Venison, the which they had no sooner done but a horrible noise or cry invades their Ears, at which, standing still to wonder what it meant, they heard it grow lowder, quoth Guy lets on and see what Monsters this wild plate affords; so passing along, at last they espyed a Dragon and a Lion encountring each other furiously, the which sport pleased Guy so well that he sate him down to be∣hold the fray, saying to Herauld whosoever gets the Victory shall try the force of my keen blade, the which no sooner said but the Dragon had so overcome the Princely Lyon with his envenomed breath, that grown faint he turned aside, at which Guy rising charged upon the Dragon's scaly hide with force exceeding, fell yet as from an Ada∣mantine Rock, his blade rebounded, till at last espying a bare place under the Mon∣sters wing, he thrust his sword some too foot deep, so that with a dreadful yell the Dra∣gon seemed to cast forth a slake of fire, and with his gushing blood his life expired; the Lion seeing his Enemy destroyed, proved not ungrateful to the destroyer, but licking of Guy's fect, and expressing all other rokens of kindness, he followed him to the Ship and then making as it were low obedience for the favour Guy had done him in killing his mortal foe he returned back to the Forrest. So to his Arms both men and beasts did yeild, Whilst Conquest crowns his brows in Mars's Field.
CHAP. X. How Guy, and Herauld travelling through a Forrest, found Earl Terry wounded and his Lady taken from him by sixteen Villains employed by Duke Otton, most of whom he kills and restores the Lady to her Husband, &c. AFter a Months Sailing by several Islands, Castles, Cities and Towns, and the many various adventites that hapned in that space, Guy arrived in Norman∣dy, where Landing, he and Herauld take their progress to the Emperours Court,
which was then kept at Burdaux, where they no sooner arrived, but the Emperour ha∣ving notice of it came to meet them, most Royasly attended, where in the entrance of the Pallace he embraced Guy, with the endearing affections and favours that Majesty could bestow, honouring him with the title of Son; so much was our Heroick Cham∣ion ostted by the greatest Potentate of Chrisendome, for his sake the Emperour cau∣sed sumptuous Feasts to be prepared, and Banquets furnished with all manner of ra∣reies, and whatsoever could delight the cast, whilst the gazing crouds flocked cound the Pallace to behold him of whom they had heard so much Fame, each chanting forth his worthy Victories, and striving to out-doe each other in singing of his praises, as the only worthy of the world: The Emperour caused Tilt and Tournament to be exerci∣sed before him, but would not suffer Guy to enter the List, because he knew none would engage with him; after he had stayed there eight daies he desired the Emperours leave ro depart that he might keep his promise with the Dukes of Lovain and Lorain, and with much difficulty obtain'd it, so loath was the Emperour and all the Princes and Nobslity of his Court to lose his company; but considring that the dearest friends must part, they dismissed him with great applause, who ordered the Captains of the Ships that then lay at Anchor in the Port to sail homewards, whilst he and Herauld trossed the Country the nearest way to the Duke of Lovains Court, the which they re∣dily obeyed, whilst Guy and Herauld mounting rode on, but had not passed above ten miles, when entring a huge Forrest, they on a suddain heard dreadful screeks and a confused noise of Kill, Kill, toward which Guy and Herauld directed by the sound came instantly, where in a path they found a man wounded, lying weltring in his blood, whom they assighting knew to be Earl Terry, whereupon they rasing him up, deman∣ed how he came in such a plight, to whom he (with a faint voice) replyed, that he ha∣ving married with a beautiful Lady, Osiled by name, whom before he was married unto, Duke Otton had requested in marriage, but she by reason of his vicious life, had efused his proffer, in revenging which he had hired sixteen villains, who having no∣rice that he and his Lady was to walk that way, lay in ambush and had set upon and mounded him after that barbarous manner; and not only so but had taken from him his wife, whom more than life he did esteem. And can the Duke said Guy deal in nothing but treachery, I lately made his vssiains repent in death so base a Treason, and if I can find out these that have thus wronged thee, they shall have equal shares dealt them; chear up my friend, and know that I am Guy, and by the Conquests that this sword has won, and all the bloody Battels this hand has sought, I fetch thee back thy Love if thou canst but direct me which way the viains went; at Guy's name Terry revived, and receiving fresh vigour saised his pale comtenance, pale for loss of blood, and rendred praise to Heaven for fending so worthy
a Hero to his aid, in such a time of great distress, and then turning to Guy, said wor∣thy sir, who have ouch  to pirty my misfortune, through that Lane they went by yonder ak; this was no sooner said, but they heard the Lady sereek, whereupon Guy ordered Herauld to stay with the Ea, and die  his wounds whilst he puruch the Ruffins, the which he had not long done before he overtook them, halling fair Osile after a rude manner: To whom Guy thus began. Villains, what dire mischief is this that your vile hands have done, for which your lives are ireited to my revenge; restore the Lady, miscreants and appease my wrath ere ir heap destruction on your wicked heads; to which they scoffingly replyed, what would this vain-glorious fellow have, he thinks, tries another, to get a name by des∣perate folly, and that for being slain, in hopes of rescuing this Lady, the world will pitry and lament his fate; a third declared that he was surely mad, which so enraged him, that bidding the Lady be of good chear, (for that he came to fetch her back unto her Lord) he drew his dreadful sword well known in war, and with it laid about so furi∣ously, that scarce a stroke fell but he kill'd or mortally wounded one or other of them, bruising their Helms and Heads, breaking their Armour at such a rate, that in an hours space ten of them lay gasping on the ground, which the trembling Lady observing, fell upon her knaes and entreated Guy to hold his Conquering hand, and shed no more blood for her sake, at which Guy moved with pitty, put up his Sword, commanding the re∣maining sir to ask the Lady forgiveness, and o thank her for their lives, the which they durst not refuse, so that Guy giving them two or three lusty knocks a piece with his sword in the eabard dismissed them, bidding them tell their treacherous Lord that his name was Guy, and that he hoped ere long to meet him in Arms, and render him the reward of his trechery; after which Guy caused the Lady to mount behind him, so they cid to the place where they left the Earl, who seeing them riding towards him, faint as he was, came supported by Herauld, to meet them, where falling down he embraced Guy's knees, readring him a thousand thanks, with nexpressible joy, saying, He should be proud to dye fighting in his cause. So much renown in Arms the Hero won That his great deeds through Europe now had run.
CHAP. XI. How Guy and Herauld went with the Earl to relieve his Father who was besiged by Duke Otton and how Guy Raised the Seige, routed the Dukes Army and kill'd him in single Combate. NOw night had cast her Sable vail over the earth, and left only the imperfect brightness of the Moons silver beams to chear the drousy Globe, when Guy, He∣rauld, Terry, and Oslil his fair spouse, had through the Forrest, vast and wild, to tra∣vel
many a mile before they came to any house or place of entertainment, but being so good company they passed on joyfully, till coming to a tuft of broad spreading trees, (that cast a horrid shade, blacker then night it self) they heard a hideous noise and roaring caused by Beasts of Prey, who having left their Dens, followed the scent of blood, as Lions, Bears, Wolves, Tigers, Panthers, Leopards and the like, when casting their eyes round they espied two Armed Knights standing with their swords drawn on their Guards, and listning to the self same eryes, who Guy and his associates coming up to, found to be two Kinsmen of the Earls, at which Terry embracing them. asked the cause that brought them into such a place so full of dread and danger, to whom they with a sigh reply. Alass my Lord! to tell you news you would not gladly hear, your Princely Father in his Castle is beseiged by raging Ottons Power, begirt with fifteen thousand men, the incensed Duke swearing to lay it level with the ground, and take your Fathers life in revenge of your taking away his Love. Alass said Terry (with a countenance that witnessed a thorow sence of grief) I take his Love, just heaven knows my innocence, speak Osi, tell this Renowned man if I at any time procured thee to break thy Faith, or ever tempted thee to act ought against thy will; never, (said the beauteous Lady) thou hast been just in all, that cruel Duke has wronged thy innocence; indeed he did make known to me his horrid Love, but his de∣sign (when I withstood to yield) was to have Ravished me by force, but Heaven alwaies pittying the distressed, prevented his black intent; thine I am and ever will be till death shall make a seperation: Well spoke fair Lady, said Guy, in whose brest are such sparks of Virtue, now I find that I must truly praise thy worth; tis for Love of a fair crea∣ture (far distant from this place) that I wars dreadful task first undertook, and through a Sea of blood have waded to obtain, and whom ere long I do intend to see, and lay my Trophies (gained by Conquest) at her feet, since I have found your constancy in perfect in their beings, fear not worthy Lovers cease your cares. Alass my Lord, said Terry, how can I be void of care and grief, when my dear Fa∣ther (dear to me as life) must unavoidably be ruined for my sake, if any guilt there could be in the case, surely I must be innocent, come then life or death, ile through the Leaguer break and free my Father, or else perish in the brave attempt. Grieve no more, said Guy, nor let restless thoughts disturb your peace; these Arms shall force the daring foe to leave the seige, or like to thundring with death hl ruine on their guilty heads, I in my Vissage bear the cripple fates, and where so e I look, se∣vere destruction marks my frowns, and death a waights to execute my will: long have I wished to meet the Duke in Arms, and now have found an opportunity unlooked for, and with as much joy go to this war as I would go to see my well pleased Phaelice smile.
At these words the Earl revived, and put on thearfulness whilst he and his fair spouse fell at Guy's feet, and would in humble thanks have kissed the ground, but that he taking them up in his arms would not permit such reverence for to be done to him a mortal man, &c. So they marched on till they came within sight of the Castle, the which stood upon a rising hill; no sooner had Fame conveyed the sound through the Army that Guy was approching, but the Commander that had heard the dreadful exploits his warlike hand had done, fled and left the Duke and some of his perticular friends to order the Forces, the Duke seeing himself in this plight grew the more desperate, vowing to continue the siege, though ten thousand Devils were approching to give the besieged aid. Guy after having dispersed some few that lay against the Eastern Gate, with the Earl Herauld and the rest entred the Castle, where finding the old Earl in much per∣plexity, Guy comforted him, as likwise Terry, Herauld, Ossil and the rest, relating what adventures had befel, at which the old man somewhat revived, Guy desired him to permit the Soldiers under his Command to sally out upon the Fee, for said he now fear has made half the Conquest, I in a minuts time will finish it, which said, all with loud shouts cryed lead on, lead on, to Victory, when on a suddain the Gates on groa∣ning hinges opened wide, and out they marched against the Foe, Guy in the Front be∣gan the Battel with such courage and fury, spurred on by keen Revenge, that the slaughtered rout fell down on either hand, and his men following it hard, in less then two hours space the amazed Tuscanes fled on all sides in confusion, leaving six thou∣sand of their dead and dying friends upon the place, which the Duke seeing, in a rage desperately minded, was resolved to dye and not survive his infamy, whereupon he sought in every part for Guy, whirling his sword about to make him room, to whom he approching, said, now have I found thee who hast haunted me from place to place, and challenge thee in Arms to try whom Fortune has designed to favour, for death is berter then an ignominious loss of honour: to whom Guy thus replyed, proud Duke, whose treacheries are not to me unknown, who causelesly sent lately to envade my life, know that I joy to meet thee; at which they rushed together, and like Lions fierce en∣countred each other, whilst from their Helms the sparks of sice flew, and ratling Ar∣mour ecchoed in the Skies till the Duke, wounded deep on the right side fainted, and fell down for loss of blood, the which Guy seeing, remembred that he was a Christian, and thereupon began to compassionate his unhappy fate, striving to recover him, but in vain; for ofter his having made a true confession of his many crimes, and asked pardon of all whom in his life-time he had offended, the crim Tyrant death prevailed and led him captive to the shades of night; at which with a relenting mind, after ha∣ving delivered him to his friends to be honourably interred, returned to the Castle,
where with great joy he was received of all, especially of Terry, Ossil and the old Earl, but after having spent two daies there with much delight, Herauld and he took their leave and departed. Still searching glory's stage to court bright fame And win themselves an everlasting name.
CHAP. XII. How Guy killed a Monstrous Bore, and of the Honour done him by the Dukes of Lo∣rain and Lovain, how he return'd to England and killed a munstrous Dragon in Northumberland, and the honour done him by the King, and his Reception by fair Phaelice. GUy and Herauld having taken leave, proceeded onwards of their journey towards the Duke of Lovains Court, but not having passed far, e're in the Forest, they saw coming towards them the hugest Bore that Earth e'r bred, whose Eyes like
two Beacons blazed, and on his back the horrid bristles stood much like a Grove of spears; his Tusks which like two Ivory bworks stood, were at least two foot in length, his jaws with blood and slaughter all besmeered, before whose rage, nor man, nor beast could staud; but Guy nothing daunted, gave his horse to Heraul for to hold and drawing out his massy blade went to meet him, at whom the beast coming with open mouth grunted horribly, Guy stood not to complement him but let sly with all his force, as if lones thunderbolts from broken-clouds had fest, so that the Bore never fee∣ling such weighty strokes nor smarting wounds till then, turned tall, and endeavou∣red to save himself by flight, but all in vain, for Guy pursuing, laid so hard upon his swinish head that down he fell be smeered with blood, and with a horrid noise that made the Forrest shake breathed out his life, after which Guy hewingoff his head, the which was at least one hundred weight, bore it upon his Launce to the Duke of Lovains Court, where no sooner arriving, but the Duke commanded all his Drums, Trum∣pets, Clarions, and other instruments of War to welcome him, going with his No∣bles to congratulate his safe return, with all the imaginable expressions of joy, and ten thousand happy wishes, sending notice of his arrival to the Duke of Lorain, wh with all the Nobility of his Court, in very splendid Equipage came to embrace the worlds admired man, and to present him with gifts and honours, though not suitable to his deserts, the two Dukes making a publique Feast for the space of ten dayes for all commers whatsoever. But Guy having been so long absent from the bright beauty who was to be the re∣ward of all his dreadful toyl, was much desirous to return for England his Native place, long it was before he could obtain their licences to depart, they still preparing one noble exercise or other to delay him, till at last he opened to them his Love, giving them to understand it was for that that he so long had roamed about the world and un∣dertaken enterprizes so perrillons, against which they could find no argument, but ordering one of the best Ships immediately to be rigged and fitted, they unwillingly dismissed him after having accompanied him to the Sea side, saying, Go and prosper thou Renowned Worthy of the world, thrice happy is the land that gave thee birth, and more happy she that must enjoy thee in her arms; may Victory a waight thee where∣soe'r thou goest, and crown thy browes with new fading Bayes. For which Guy having returned his humible thanks, gave order to hoist up Sail, and having a good forewind, in four dayes touched on English ground. The which the King no sooner hearing of but he sent several of his Nobles to de∣sire his company at York, where then he kept his Court, Guy hearing that it was his Soveraigns pleasure, stood not to dispute, but joyfully accompanied them, though he had rather have gone to his inestimable jewel, the fair Phaelice.
First no sooner Herauld and he were conducted to the Kings presence, where he sate in his Throne with all his Nobles standing cound about him, but they offered to kneell as was their duty, but the King forbade it, and rising from his Chair of State, took them in his arms and embraced them, saying, worthy Champions, by whom my Realm is famous through the world, and especially by you fir Guy, whose Arms have done such wonders as amaze mankind, before whose arm the haughty foes still bowed their stubborn necks; Monsters and Tyrants by thy prowess fell, and Armies seate∣red, strewed the field with slain, matchless in War, in Arms not to be equalled, Fames brazen Trumpet hath thy worth proclaimed, and thee the everliving Monument of true Heroick greatness stiled, spreading thy mighty Deeds unto the utmost cornees of the Laud, thou the Oppressors scourge, and the oppressed's shield, receive such fa∣vours as a King can give. At which Guy bowing low, and returned all humble thanks, he thus begun, Dread Soveraign Lord, to whom I all Allegiance owe, your praises of my worth are too to great for my deserts; but could there be an enterprize found out of greater difficulty, wherein your most obedient subject could do ought to merit the least of these favours your Highness heaps upon e, I should think my self for ever blest, a happi∣ness so infinite I should be proud to purchase with my Life. Alass said the King (and with that he sighed) there is an enterprize of dangerous consequence within the limits of this Isle, but I must hide it from thee least in such a dangerous attempt I lose the best of Subjects, and thou at home have thy Herosek deeds lipsed by foil or death. My ever honoured Lord said Guy, conceal not your Printely thoughts, give me that danger whatsoever it is, and i'l with open arms go joyfully to meet it were it the dreadfullest that ever Fate devised. Then since thou wilt know brave English Hero, tis a dreadful Dragon bred amongst the Rocks in Northumberland, of a Monstrous size, who for this moneth past has infe∣sted all that Countrey killing both man and beast, so terrible to behold, that all the peo∣ple within ten miles of his Cave have left their habitations desolate, and for hast many their flasks and heards, the which he preys upon, and gluts his venomous jaws with slaughter; many of our Knights have gone to Combate him, but with such fatal success, that either wounded with his mortal sting, or poysoned with the infectious air he breaths, they have either dyed upon the plate, and there served to gorgs his hellish maw or soon after, and so cunning is the Feind, that if he sees any number of Armed men regether, e will not descend from his Rocks, but there abide, or with expanded wings bear himself a loft in the air: I tell you not this because I would have you ha∣zard your life in so perillous an enterprize, no I had rather that County shouldly wast then you exposed unto mortal danger.
To whom Guy thus replyed. Most redoubted Soveraign, the news you tell me has already filled me with more joy then can he well expressed, shall I that have freed so many Nations from the Pests, now in the prime of all my strength, decline the free∣ing of this, in which I first breathed my vital air, no, may it but please your High∣ness to order me a Conduct where to find this Monster, or rather fiend, I now by all the favours that your Majesty has heaped upon me, that before the Sun has twice rounded this Globe of Earth, his head upon a Launce, fast fixed, shall to your Ma∣jesty be brought, more monstrous he cannot be then him whom I hereaved of Lise in the Lovanian Forrest. At Guy's earnest request, the King ordered twelve Knights to wait upon him, of whom Herauld was one, who had sworn not to leave him in any adventure whatsoe∣ver, whereupon Guy tek his leave, and the King bestowed many blessings upon him, wishing him prosperous success, and that he might be victorious over the destroying Dragon. No sooner was Guy departed on his journey, but a Messenger from the great Coun∣sel then assembled at Lincoln, came to give his Majesty to understand that his Presence was required there, about deciding a business of much concernment, whereupon he posted thither, where for a while we must leave him and follow Guy into Northumber∣land. Where being arrived, he no sooner came within keen of the Rock, wherein was the Dragons Cave, but he found the mangled carcasses of Men and Beasts lye seatre∣red on the Plain, some half devoured and others swollen with Poyson; at which sight not daunted in the least, he forwards rides, bidding his Knights stay behind at some distance, least the Monster leaving him should set on them, not so well able to with∣stand his force. Having advanced within a furlong of the Cave, the Dragon espies him, and greedy of his prey, with broad wing out-spread, that drove the air around him like a Whirl∣wind as he flew, came at Guy staring on him with eyes that seemed to bur like Lamps of sire, hissing horribly, Guy having set his Launce in his rest met him with a full career, and hitting him just upon the brest, his scaly harness burst the Launce into an hundred peices without to much as making the least impression; at which he drew his sword, and with redoubled force laid at the Monsters head, whiles he extended his for∣ked sling, disgorging black poison on the ground, and with a dreadful Yell made at him with his teeth and claws, sometimes on the Earth, sometimes aloft in the air h assails the Champion, who watching his opportunity as he was rising, struck him a full blow under the wing that spoiled his slight, the swarthy blood gushing out a main, of which Guy taking the advantage, ran him in so deep, that reathing of life's seat
with horrid yells that made the Rocks resound; he breathed out his last, whilst from his mouth that opened wide, was seen to issue forth a flake of five; his head with much labour he hewed off, and firing it upon the Truncheon of his Spear, he ids hack to his Knights, who overjoy'd at his success, welcom'd him and sung him victorious Champion, most Renown'd on earth, placing a wreath of Laurel on his head, and so rid on till they came to York, but having notice of the King's departure they stayed not there but Posted to Liacoln, where they were received with all the signs of joy ima∣ginable, the gazing couds from all parts came to see the mighty Champion so much aised by Fame. The King no sooner heard of his coming, but rising from the Counsel Board, at∣tended by all the Nobility presant, he want to meet im, when beholding the Monstrous head he blessed himself, saying, it was surely made to devour all mankind, such gla∣ring Eves, and rows of Monsteous Teeth, Rabid jaws, armed with scale of Ada∣mant, and forked stings, whose points excerded the sharpest steell, and at least a yard in length, from which, said he, her caster Heaven defend this Isle; with that he gave order to one of his Knights to receive it at Guy's hands, and afterwards embraced him with unfeigned joy, saying, west art thou worthy of our Royal favours, thou most Renowned of men, whose brave Erploits shine now as bright as the noon day-Sun, Honours first born thou art, and Eldest son of Fame, how shall we express thy praises, whose all-Conquering arm no power of mortals can withstand. The which Guy modestly endeavoured to excuse, but in vain, for the more he excu∣sed, the more he was honoured, the King sending two Knights skilled in Limnick to take the just proportion of the Dragon's carkas, the which they did, and found it to be thirty foot in length, and alike in all proportion; the Picture being hung up in War∣wick Castle, but of that more hereafter: By this time Fame had conveyed to Phaelice the news of Guy's being with the King at Lincoln (the rest she having heard before) delayes not, but mounting her Palfry came attended with several Ladies thither, where finding Guy, who little expected her there, they embraced each other, and wept for joy; Alass said Phaelice, my Love, couldst thou neglect me thus, as to be in England so long without letting me know, tis sure thou hast forgot thy vows, or were they only feigned; to whom Guy answered mild: Bright center of my soul, on whom all my joyes depend, and all the dreadful toyles of War that I have undergone seem small, since thou in recompence aford'st me Love; look on me my dear joy, my faithful heart is ever thine, it was still with thee in all the dangers that I underwent, thou art the only she this Land contains that willingly at my Arrival I would first have seen, but being fent for by the King, at my first setting foot on shoat, I was obleiged to obey my Soveraigns Commond, and after freed the land by slaying of the hugest Dragon that the earth e'r bred.
No more my Lord, said Phaelice, I have heard of all thy brave Exploits, such ha∣zards you shall never undertake for me again, I am now thy own, in Loves soft wars we will hereafter contend; so saying she wept for joy, and Guy embraced her, smo∣thering her Tears with Kisses. The Marriage day proposed, Guy gives the King to understand the summ of all, how for Love of beauteous Phaelice he had undertaken those enterprizes, and waded through a Sea of blood, desiring that his Majesty would acquaint Earl Robands with the same, and procure his free consent, for as yet he knew not of their Loves. This the King promised to perform, and that himself, his Queen, and all the Court would grace the Wedding with their presance, the which was appointed to be kept at Warwick, the Queen sending Phaelice many Iewels and other rich presants, and all imaginable preparations great and costly were prepared for entertaining of the Royal Guest. Whilst Fame did loudly sing his mighty praise And Crown'd his head with never sading Bayes.
CHAP. XIII. How Guy and Phaelice are joyned in Wedlock, and of their splendid entertainment, how afterwards be vows a Pilgrimage, and Travels to the Holy Land, how in his way he kills Amarant a monstrous Giant, and delivers the Prisoners under his Tiranny kept in tortures. THe happy Nuptial day long looked for, being come, the King and Queen with all the Court to Warwick strair repair, attended and adorned with all the Pompous Magnificence that can be imagined on so great an occasion.
Earl Roband no sooner understanding by the King's Letter that Guy was arrived in England, and that for the Love of his beauteous daughter he had undertaken the dreadful toiles of War, and Combates fierce abroad, and eke at home, and that he was come to Warwick to ask his consent, and being overjoyed he went to meet him. Guy perceiving him come towards him, bowed himself to the ground, whereup∣on the Earl hasted, and taking him in his arms, embraced him with all the expressi∣ons of Love and Friendship; Guy no sooner asking his consent, but his reply was, that he should ever be bound to bless heaven for enclining to so Heroick and brave a man to ask that of him which he himself had so often wished would come to pass, and that his generation should be so famoused by an allyance with the worthiest Champion that e'r trod the Globe; for which Guy returned humble thanks, and thereupon Phaelice being called, blushing with virgin modesty, freely, and to her no small con∣tent yielded. Business being brought to this pass, the Earl gave order for the sumptuous Enter∣tainment; commanding the Keepers of his Parks to prepare a hundred fat Bucks, which were served up with all the choicest dainties of the Land, after the Churches Seal had joyned the lovely pair, Wine flowing round in such abundance for to enter∣tain the Royal guest, that it was to be admired the Nation could affoard so much, all manner of Fowls and Fishes rateable, that the Air or Sea contained: so that Ahasu∣erus when he Feasted all the Eastern Provinces could not outdo this; the Banque ended, mellodious instruments of Musick were brought, and the Ladies of Honour, and Lords, attendants on the Court, danced before the King and Queen, the Earl and his Countess, Guy and his fair Bride, who deck with Iewels, sate bright as the Morning Star, nor was Guy's one Father and Mother wanting to be there: after the Dances ended, several Playes were presented and Songs sung containing Guy's He∣roick Acts, to the infinite satisfaction of all the Assembly, every one joying the Mar∣ryed pair, whilst Hymen descending in a Cloud, sung to soft Musick, as followeth.
SONG. 1. Happy for ever Blessed be Whom Heaven has joyn'd in Unity, Let Peace and Honour still attend And joyes, such joyes as know no end. Still live in Love, and banish care Whilst I pronounce you happy are. 2. Great Ma of War whom Beauty charms Embrace thy goddess in thy arm, Live Live for ever in delight Loves soster Wars does now invite To Mars no more dread homage pay Tis Love tis Love you must obey. 3. Loves power commands, you must submit So has the Deity thought fit Gaist pointed Beauty, Armour's vain Through it Love wounds with pleasing Pain Then happy in each others bliss Make Earth make Earth a Paradise. After the Song ended, Masquarades were performed, and all the noble sports that could be imagined to delight the senses; the Festival continuing for the space of ten daies, but no long after, this joy was eclipsed by the death of the noble Earl, who dy∣ed of a violent Fever, to the unspeakable grief of all men, making Guy sole Heir of all his Lands and Lordships; the King confirming upon him the Title of Earl of War∣wick, he being henceforwards ranked in all assemblies of Councel and other meetings
amongst the Lords and Peers of the Nation, and highly esteemed of all, &c. But to see in the midst of joy and delight what suddain Eclipses (at which the world not a little wondred) overspread the bright sun-shine of infant bliss, for Guy tumina∣ting over the past actions of his life, began seriously to consider with himself what an ocean of blood he had waded through to purchase his beauteous Bride; for which being smitten with remorse of Conscience, he fell into a deep Melancholy, and often retired in private to vewail his sins committed against Heaven, saying, That to gain honour & renown to please a woman, he had provoked the just incensed God of all the Earth, and that his crimes were many, great and grievous; and that without speedy Repentance they would prove his eternal ruine, with many other feeling expressions of deep sorrow and contrition; so that his warlike eyes that were wont to sparkle fire, now flowed with briny Tears, whilst sighs and groans declared the agony he strove under. Which Phaelice one day having watched him to his retirement, observing him in submssive wise, entreated to know the cause of so suddain alteration, saying, if she had any waies offended, she would upon her knees beg pardon, and be sure for to transgress no more in the like nature; and with that she tenderly wept, whose Tears Guy not be∣ing able to behold, raised her in his arms and began to comfort her saying, weep not bright Angel, thou fairest and divinest of thy sex, in whom alone such vertues dwell as can equal the best of women dwelling on the earth. No my adoared Mistress, tis for my boundless sins that now turn back upon my Conscience in their native ugliness and vile deformity, whose numbers are as number∣less as sands on the Barrachian shores, the flower of youth and strength I have vainly spent, puffed up with sond imaginations and the love of thee, in a red Sea of blood have I sailed about the world, and with this hand laid thousands silent, pale in deaths cold Tombs, who else might now have been alive; but thou art innocent of such impieties, twas fortunate success and my ambition that prompted me to such extream ills, the which I now with Tears lament, and must to Heaven make satisfaction, for a long and weary Pilgrimage unto the Holy Land I have resolved to take, my vows are past and shall not be recalled, therefore my lovely Phaelice weep no more, tis to the holy Sepul∣chre i'l go, and see the place where my dear Saviour for sinful mans redemption hum∣bled himself so low as to abide in, after his having taken our nature upon him, and where he suffered and laid down his precious life for us unworthy miserable wretches, who make it our chief ends to disobey his will. So saying, he sighed and groaned with∣in himself, at which Phaelice again bedewed her beauteous face with Tears, the which he smothering with a Kiss, and thus mildly did procaed; alass my fair one, for thy sake I could willingly stay at home, but for the sake of my immortal soul (more dear) I must perform my vows; live chast my Phaenix like the Turtle Dove, and win immortal
praises by thy vertuous life: Remember the Renowned Women of former times, as Penellope, Edilfridia, and Edilthrudis, with many others, who after being marryed, accounted Chastity their greatest pride, contemning all desires of marriage blis. I know thou art so much composed Divine, that thou canst equal, if not excaed them all; for sure it is twas for thy sake, and to procure thy Love, that I trampled upon Crowns and Scepters, forcing Princes and Potentates to yeild their breaths, though I must confess the fault was only mine, and thou art innocent; but alass too long I de∣lay to make satisfaction: For my guilt Armour lye there, and all my Conquests he forgot, in a Pilgrims weed I now will Travel the world with weary steps: Come my dear and gentle Phaelice deliver me thy Ring, and take thou mine, the Pledge of our dear remembrance and Love, the which beholding, though distant many miles divided by rough Waves, let us think on each other; and if e'r I return to see this my Native Land, ile send it thee that thereby thou maist have knowledge of my arrival, he had no sooner ended, but drowned in tears that burst from her starry Eyes, she wrung her hands complaining against her cruel Fates, thus soon to seperate her from her Lord, begging on her knees his stay, but finding his resolution fixed too deep to be removed, she unwillingly consented, promising to have him ever in remembrance, injoyning him the same by her, so unknown to any, she accompanied him to the Ship in which he was to pass for Ially, and there with a thousand endearing Kisses took her leave of him, not knowing where she ever should behold him more, and so with sad and heavy cheer she return'd to Warwick Castle, where for a while we must leave her and follow Guy into Itally, where suffering many storms at Sea, he arrived safe, and Landing only with a staff and scrip travelled over the Countrey pensive and alone, passing many a wild Forrest and Desart place, till having gone about two hundred miles close by a murmering Brook o'r spread with Poplars and Osiers he espyed an aged Knight sit∣ting and greatly be wailing his misfortune, Crying alass! what now but woe and mi∣sery, which nought but Death can put a period too; cruel was the Tyrant thus to be∣reave me of all my Sons, not leaving me so much as one for to support and comfort me in my deelining age; Nay more, what horrour seizes me to think the miseries they en∣dure, by his Tyrannick rage their deaths are lingring, but mine shall not be so. With that he drew his Sword and being about to fall thereon, Guy stepped to him and hindred the intended violence, saying. Reverend Sir, make known to me the cause of this your grief that has driven you upon such despair, if it lye in the power of man to right your wrongs, perhaps I may be the man that will reverse your woes. At which the Knight fixing his eyes on Guy, with a deep sigh thus spake. Alas Pil∣grim, thou art not able to give case unto my grief, 'tis death alone must cure my plaint, be not so rash said Guy but tell the cause, you know not what hidden force these Arms
contain why then said he, kind stranger, since you will understand my misery, know that yonder Castle large and strong, dwells one Amarant a Gigantiek Tyrant, of such a monstrous size, as Earth I think never brought forth before, who feeding upon hu∣mane flesh seizes all that pass these Woods, and either dead or alive bears them to his horrid Prison, in which not only of Gentlemen but tender Ladies he at this time holds Captive at least one hundred, the Women for his Lust and the men for his pastime put to various tortures; my only daughter unadvisedly straying this way, was taken by the Monster, upon which my fifteen Sons, desirous to rescue her, went Armed to fight against the Tyrant, but not being able to withstand his force were all taken Pri∣soners, whose Lives I hear, for their sisters sake he spares, but every day devises for them new torments: now thou hast heard me out, what thinkst thou? have I not cause enough for death? To whom Guy thus Replyed. Alass Sir, I pitty you, yet am glad I came so luck∣ily to save your Life, and free your Sons if yet alive; could you perform so meritori∣ous a work said the Knight, with humble thanks to you ide kiss the ground and bless this happy day, but I fear tis altogether vain for to attempt, for many have whose Skuls lye scattered round the dreadful place: Far not said Guy, lend me but your sword and Armour, ile try that fortune which has never turned against me yet whilst you stay here, and pray for my success: So saying, he departed, and coming to the Castle Gate, thundred at it so loud as made the hollow walks to eccho, at which the dreadful Giant reused, came forth Armed from head to foot, bearing a weighty Club some six foot long, and seeing Guy, stared on him with Eyes that seemed to spar∣kle like fire, saying, sirrah, how durst you thus presume to hinder my repose? know you not tis death for to approach this place, much more to be so bold, it may be so said Guy, were your arms equal to your will; but it was to seek you that drew me to this place, know Tyrant tis not your monstrous size I dread, to which the Gyant storing, re∣plyed, to an ill purpose at thou come, for with thy flesh will I feast the Fowls of the air, whilst my self shall quaff thy d, and with that laid at Guy with his Massy Club, who nimbly avoided the coming stoaks  drew his sword, so that a dreadful fight began, which long continued douful, till through excess of heat Amarant began to saint, which Guy perceiving, redoubled his force and hewed upon his Armour till he dinted and cut it through in several places, which the crafty Giant finding, the better to recover breach, feighned thirst, and besought Guy to le him drink of the adjacent Ri∣ver, and not to take the advantage of Natures enforcements, to which Guy readily condescended, saying, Drink thy fi, that so I may have the greater task to Con∣or thee, who when subdued, shall have no excuse, so said Heroick Guy. And Amarant strait to the River hasted, drinking largely of the swelling flood,
whilst Guy stood prepared to receive him at his return. The Giant having ended his draught and quenched his thirst, takes up his Club and comes at him with all his force, rest having added fresh vigour; the which Guy observing, nimbly avoided the furious stroake, which falling on the ground entred above a foot therein, so that before he could recover his stroak, Guy struck him full on the head, which made him recoil six huge paces, but wheeling about he charged again with greater force then before, so that the Combate having continued about the space of four hours, Guy grew thirsty, desiring the like leave that he before had graunted, to which Amarant scoffingly repl∣ed, he never was so great a fooll as to releive his foe, but to take all advantages; this so inraged Guy, that with force exceeding he smoat upon the Gyants Crest, and with three blows brought him to the ground, who fasting like a Ciclops made the Earth to quake, and being down cryed out for quarter, but in vain; for Guy remembring his base ingratitude, immediatly lopped off his frightful head, which divided from the Monsterous trunk he fixed on the Gates, and taking the Key he entred the Castle, where he found the wofullest Spectacles that e'r his eyes beheld; tender Ladies in k Dungeons, living for many years on humane flesh, nay forced to eat their hus∣bands, or their nearest friends; such was the rigour of the merciless Tyrant. These he released, but going farther, found a massy dore on brazen Pillars hung, he not having the Keys forced them open with Iron instruments he found in the Ca∣stle, where he had no sooner entred, but he beheld such sights as made him start with horrour, above fifty persons (among which were the Knights Sonns) hanged up by the heels, many of them with their heads downwards, other by the Wrists, and some by the middle or Privy Members, all looking as pale as death, who no sooner hea∣ring the Gate open, but supposed it had been the Gyant coming to torment them (as his use was to make himself pastime) whereupon they with lamentable cries began to beseech him to put them ut of their pains: But contray, Guy gently took them down, who through weakness were no wayes able to stand; when he had done this, he went and called the Knight, who no sooner entred and saw what Guy had done, but falling at his feet he rendred him ten thousand thanks, but Guy taking him up, embraced him, saying, he alwayes had vowed to right the wronged, and help the op∣pressed against the mighty oppressor; this he having sayed, and they understanding he was their deliverer, with tears of joy blessed the day that gave him birth, and a thou∣sand times more this in which he had released them from their torments; after which Guy having comforted them all he could, delivered the Keys of the Castle to the Knight, with strict charge carefully to look to the distressed Ladies, and the rest, he put off the Armour, and taking his gown and his staff, departed towards Jerusalem, with many a weary step over Hills and Rockey Mountains, through Woods and For∣rests,
where the dreadful wild Beasts roared around him, sositary all alone, and of∣ten sitting down in the shade, or by some murmuring brook, would with tears bewail his sins, and condemn himself for the many great transgressions he had committed, lamenting his youthful follyes, whilst Wildings and Berries were his dayly food, and water from the Christal Spring sufficed for drink to quench his thirst, whom now we must bewailing his depraveties, and return into England to take a view how Phaelice bears the absence of her wandring Lord. Whilst through untroden muzes he does stray To Juda's Land his sins to purge away.
CHAP. XIV. How Guy's departure out of England is lamented, and of strange Adventures that be∣fel him in the Holy Land, how at his return he Routed Amantbuses's his Army, and restored Earl Terry to his Lordships, afterwards returning into England which he found almost destroyed by the Danes. NO sooner did the King and the Nobility hear that Guy was departed the Land on a Pilgrimage, but they were struck mute with admiration, wondring that he could so soon leave the fairest creature England had, for a toylsome and solitary
life, yet commend his Piety that began such early Repentance, and set his Soul at far greater value then all his Honours, or glittering Treasures, so that for this he'l gain as much applause as before he had done for his victories. In the mean while Phaelice pensive, and shunned all converse unless it were concer∣ning her Lord, keeping her self reserved and Chast, seldome being seen abroad, the Queen and several great Ladies came several times to visit her, and to perswade her out of her melancholy, but in vain; she would not harken to tales of mirth, but often retiring ints her Closet, she would bewail his absence, saying, Alas where wanders now my Guy, what unknown Climate holds that far-famed man whom Europe lately held in Admiration; but now unknown in poor array he traes the Desarts thinking on me, whilst Tears gush from his brim-ful Eyes, and sitting down under some spreading shade bemoans my loanly state, wishing himself oft in my armes. Oh why did we ever part, for this short moments bliss that was scarce worth his thoughts, did he undertake such toil and six years spend in dreadful War, alass! could it be my Lord that could leave me thus forlorn, beret of joy, and comfortless, even in th dawn of Happiness, overcasting with thick Clouds of sorrow the morning Sun, when all my hopes were growing perfect; a cruel Fate to me, but it is for the sake of thy im∣mortal Soul which makes me bear it with the les regret, and be more patient in thy absence, hoping one day to behold thy much beloved face again, but where e'r thou art I know thy thoughts are fixed upon mae; thy heart is oft in England, though thou art far remote; tis sure thou canst not forget thy Phaelice whom once thou lovedt so dear, no I know thou canst not, I should wrong thy Vertues should I but imagine it; Oh my Lord couldst thou but know how sensible I am of the great dangers that you must needs hazard your self in, whilst through Wildernesses large and wide you travel, de∣detitute of food, and ly abnoctious, now unarmed, to the devouring jaws of each brast of Prey, and your absence bath tortured thus my poor bleeding heart with fear, which is worse then death it self, but wheresoever thou goest, this is my comfort my sul a∣tends thee, though my body from the watery Globe's divided, Leagues without num∣ber. So saying, her eyes burst out with Pearlly Tears, and sobs stopped the passage of her voice, refusing all pleasant Wines or sumptuous Diet, her delight being only to feast the Poor, and dayly to relieve with her own hand such as cae for Charity, whilst her Lord having travelled through Arabia and Palestin, after many a weary step ar∣rived at the long wished for place, the which to visit in those Popish times, was held sufficient to expiate all sins committed till that time, &c. Guy took curious Observations th of the Sepulchre wherein the Aramathenian deposited the glorious body of our blessed Saviour inhumanely put to death by the cruel
Iews, after that, the ruined Temple wherein he taught, as likewise Mount Calary or Golgatha, where his precious blood was shed for sinful man; then the Relies of the Cross, the Crown of Thorns and Scourge, and many other memorials kept in the Church, now built upon the Holy Sepulchre by the Patriarch. Having stayed there about some twenty years with great Devotion, he felt a natural decay, know∣ing that Age still hurryed death on; and being much desirous to lay his bones in his Native Land, and to see his virtuous Wife before death cloased his eyes with long benighting slumber; he takes his leave to tread back again those steps that he had trod before: Wandring through divers Countries and Regions barefooted all day, and when night came reposed in some hollow Cave that Nature had Arched with Pumice, or beneath some spreading Oak, laying his head upon the Mossy Bark; so passing on by degrees till he came into Itally, where long he had not travelled before he met with his old acquaintance Earl Terry, whose Father beig dead, Duke Ottons Son, by name Amanibus, had invaded his Tertitories, and having overthrown him in three huge battels, had taken from him his Lordships and Dominions in the revenging his Father, slain by Guy, and himself being forced to fly to save his life, which Guy un∣derstanding, bid him be of good chear; for as I am an English man, said he, I will do thee right, and bear the Vsurper back to his own Tuscany at the naming of an En∣glishman, Terry revived, and with a dp fetched sigh, said. Worthy Sir, there was an Englishman once so much my friend as to save mine and my Fathers Life from the, assatling Tuscanes; but I fear death has laid him low in some silent Grave, he not ha∣ving been heard of in these parts for many years; his name was Guy a man renow∣ned above the rest of men: so said, the woful Earl not knowing Guy (time having so altered his Warlik face) to whom Guy answered (not willing to make himself known) Most Noble Earl I knew the man you speak of, and oft have seen him in dreadful Battels tryed, whilst through the bloody fields I ranged and chaced the Foe with e∣qual success, speaking in these ambiguous words, he desired the Earl to fetch him auit of the highest proofed Armour and a strong sword, and then to Muster up what men he had left, and leave the event to Heaven; in all this he was readily obeyed, so that in a dayes space every thing was compleat for the March, Guy causing the Trum∣pets to sound aloud, at the noise of which some of the Tuscanes ascending the upper∣most Turcet of the Castle, saw four thousand men (all the remains of twenty thouand the rest being slain) marching toward them, of which they advertised Amanthus, who conjecturing it to be Terry, commanded his Souldiers to arm, and opening the gate  the town issue dout in good order about sixteen thousand strong, marching in three Battalia's, which Terry observing would have sled, but Guy hartned him on, saying himself would egin the Battel and charge the whole Army through; long it was not
before they came up close to each other, the Tuscans giving such a shout as made the hills to Eccho; upon which Guy having drawn out one thousand of his choscest men, ordered to sound the Charge, and thereupon with force exceeding, engaged the first Embatteiled Squadron of the Enemies main Body, who dreamed of no such fury, and broe through their Ranks disordering and putting them into great confusion, whilst Guy layd round about him, and at every stroke one or other slew: in the mean while Terry was not idle, for animated by Guy's example, he on the other side har∣ged Amanthus with the like success, so that nothing but slaughter raged through the Plain, the conflict continuing dreadful for the space of four hours, when the Tuscans found themselves infinitelp worsted began to shrink, and by disranking fell into so great a disorder that their Commanders could not draw them up, which Guy perceiving, pressed on cutting his way through Troops and Regiments, and making such dread∣ful havock that though Amanthus with many of his trusty Friends going through the Army entreated them to take courage, yet could he not restrain their flight, so that all retreat to the town, being cut off by two thousand that wheeled to the right, they fled confused to the Woods and hills scattering themselves on every hand. Guy and the Earl having pursued them till night, returned, where they found the Citizens come out to meet the Earl, with the Keys, expressing great joy, for those that were left to guard it hearing of the overthrow durst not attend the sequel, but abando∣ned it and fled, which they no sooner perceived, but they entred in great Triumph, and there that night the Earl entertained Guy with all imaginary splendor, even weeping for joy to be so unlooked for restored, desiring to know his name that had wrought such wonders in his behalf, but refused to make known who he was, nor did he as sormer∣ly, take any delight in Applauses, or entertainment, but getting up betimes the next morning, left the City unknown to the Earl or any of his Attendants, so that journy∣ing to the Sea side, he found a Ship just going for England, in which he joyfully Em∣barqued, the Vessel being bound for Bristol (which was then likewise a place famous for Marchandize) in eighteen dayes they arrived there, where Landing they heard most doleful and unwelcome News, for Canuce King of Denmark on a pretended quarrel for the loss of his Father, who putting to Sea in a small Boat, and a Tem∣pest immediately arrising he was driven on this shore, and being taken by one of the Barons of the Cinque Ports, was carryed before the King, who nobly entertained him, and for his great skill in Hawking made him his cheif Faulconer, which raised such envy in him that he was displeased upon that account, that one day taking his op∣portunity in a Forrest he slew him and fled into France. Which Murther being laid to the Kings charge, who was altogether ignorant of it, the Danes under their aforesaid Captain, and several others under pretence of Re∣venge,
but more out of greediness for Prey and Plunder, Landed with about twenty thousand men, and after them ten thousand more, with which they ravaged and laid waste the Countrey, destroying with fire and sword all before them, ravishing wo∣men and Virgins, and then ripping them up alive; dashing babes against the ground, and all other horrid impieties that can be imagined; so terrible they dealt, that the people fled before them, dreading them worse than a Pestilence; the King having ga∣rhered together the English Forces, had sought several Battels in which he was worsted, and thereupon retired with his friends to Winchester, a Town then so strong that it was impossible to take it unless by starving, Powder, that Hellish En∣gine, then lay deep hidden in the secrets of the Earth, and was not formed to belch de∣struction to mankind, against which the Danes having drawn all their Forces, besieged it almost round, there being no passage in or out but at the Western Gate, Guy upon this sad News and distress of his King and Countrey thither he makes all speed, re∣solving to raise the Siege or lose his life. Nor age detains him but through guarding Foes He Fights his way and deals them stormes of blowes.
CHAP. XV. How the King being Besieged at Winchester, Guy undertook to fight with Colbron a Monstrous Giant, Kills him and routs the Danish Army, forcing them with great slaughter to fly the Land, and then betakes himself to his solitary Cave where he lived many years unknown. GUy no sooner entring the Town, but he went upon the Walls to veiw the Ene∣mies Forces how they lay Encamped, and what their numbers were, not in the
least making himself known to any: Long he had not been there, but out from a Tent placed on the Northside, came proudly strutting, an Armed Gyant of Monstrous size, being at least twelve foot in height and eight in thickness, he being the man that had so terrified the English and made great slaughter on them in all the Battels that were fought, none being able to resist his strength, but still fled before him, he wea∣ring underneath his high proofed Armour a shirt of Mail, and bearing a great two edged Sword: Long he had not stalked like a huge Colossus on the plain, but (dis∣dainfully) aloud he called unto the King, and thus began for to Revile, Athelitone now no more King of England, but our Prisoner, mued up within these Walls which we e'r long will Level with the ground, in vain it is to trust to your defence, come forth and try your Manhoods in the field, dy here like men, and so perhaps you may purchase to your selves the names of Valiant; but if like Cowards there you stay, till we slaughter you within your walls, and roast you in the flaming Town, Infamy un∣to posterity will blot the false fam'd English Renown, which has spread wide into the world, a report of such doowds as you never durst adventure: Tis agreed by all the Cap∣tains of our Army, that if amongst all your Nobles, you can find a man that dares to Combate me, in which Combate if he remains victorious, they will not only raise the Siege but depart the Land and leave you in Peace and quietness; so said the proud insulting Foe, at which their Armies shouted loud and gave him great applause. At which daring affront, the King being much perplexed turned to his Nobles, deman∣ding if any of them would adventure on the Noble Enterprize: Remember said he how great Goliah fell by David's hand; and shall this Pagan outbrave us thus, for shame my Lords let it not be known: Tis Heavens cause we fight, for the defence of the true Christian Faith, as well as for our Countreys honour; who can tell but God may have put this offer into their hearts, either to free us from distress, or to deliver them into our hands: If none will undertake it, I my self will Encounter with the haughty Foe, and if I perish Heavens will be done. So said the King, but all around stood mute, looking on each other who should first Reply, which Guy (who had stood all that while undiscovered) observing, with anger groaned, and coming to the King most humbly besought his Majesty to confer on him the Honour of the Combate, to which the King (not dreaming who it was, for all supposed Guy then dead, by reason he had not been heard of in so long a time) made answer, las poor Pilgrim, for so thou seemest to be, thou art not able to contend with one so Mighty, I had a Champion once, whom Death has now snatch'd from me, on whose head I would have ventured my Life and Crown, Oh — Renowned Guy for ever lost, thou wouldst not have seen thy Soveraingn thus affronted and abused, with that he turn'd and went, whose Royal Tars grieved Guy for to behold, still with supplications, pressing him that he
would give consent: Saying, Dread Lord, though I'm now unknown to you, yet trust my Courage for this once, and by Heaven, I vow before the Sun descends be∣neath the Western deep, he that has braved you now shall pay his Life for the affront, at which Heroick speech the King stood amazed, and wondred at the greatness of his say∣ing, I have accepted thee, thou shalt be the man on whom I'l venture England, and immediately ordered his own Armour to be brought, which Guy retiring, put on, least he should be known, and girding on a massy sword came to the King to take his leave, which the Nobles seeing, began to offer their services, but the King would not permit them now, but embracing Guy unknown, said, Go thou worthy man and Heaven di∣rect thy hand to quest thy Foe; at which Guy returning humble thanks departed, whilst on the walls all stood for to behold the Frey: No sooner was he come within call of Colbron's Camp, so was the Giant named, but he cryed aloud: Come forth presump∣tuous Dane, who durst so late put base affront upon Majesty; behold me English born that am come to chastise thy insolence, at which the Dane rousing from his Couch whereon he was laid, came forth; where no sooner beholding Guy, but frowning, and dreadfully glared on him with his fiery Eyes, and thus disdainfully began. And could the King amongst his Lords find out no youthfuller for the Combate fit, but to send an old man ready to drop into the Grave, who weary of his Life growes desperate, and fears not death, as knowing by course of Nature a few moments more would put a period to his dayes; tis sure he sent thee to mock me, and mae me more enraged; b be it how it will thou never shallt return alive; perhaps so aid Guy, if you can hinder it, but as wise and as strong as you, have been mistook; contemn not Age in me, these arms and my just cause shall soon decide the business of the War; so saying, they char∣ged upon each other with such force as made their ratling Harness Eccho in the Skies, and fire like Lightning from each Helm flew; the Combate being dreadful to tehd, bloody and doubtful, the Dane never been so matched before, wounds were received on both sides, whiles shouts that rent the Sky (from the Town and Danish Camp) were sent, but Fortune who till now had stood neuter, began to turn on Guy's Victorious arm, whom she had failed never, so that with a full blow, he cutting through Colbron's Armour gave him a wound in the left shoulder, from whence the blood flowing amain, he begain to faint and faulter, in his strokes, which Guy perceiving laid the fiercer on, and redoubling his strength, whilst piecemeal down his harness dropped, whereupon the Giant entreated Guy for to desist, and seemingly let him the Conquest gain, and he would promote him in the Danish Army: Fooll as thou art said Guy, thy suit and Coward-fear are now to be despised, thinkest thou that England's Crown I'l lose un∣less I lose my Life; no know presumptuous man how thou wert mistaken at the first, and much more now at last; with that his dreadful blade he swings about his head,
which in the air much like a Commet showed, and with a redoubled blow, which like a Thunderbolt fell on Colbron's head, he broke his Helm and peirced so deep into his head, that staggering ten paces back he dropped upon the ground, which the Danes see∣ing, (contrary to agreement) came running to his aid, but all too late, for Guy had hewed his Head off from the Monsterous Trunk, and with his Sword drove the dis∣ordered Squadron back, slaughtering them on every side, so that none durst come within the reach of his Sword, but to the earth fell wounded or slain. The King from the walls perceiving in what danger he was in, with six thousand all that he had left, Sallied out of the Town, and instantly came to his Rescue, charging upon the formost with such bravery, that he bore down all before him, who for loss of their Champion were now grown fearful, so that breaking through their Ranks he disordered them, and the English fighting courragiously for their Lives and Liber∣ties, made a great slaughter: whilst this was doing, Guy who had retired to refresh himself, being well mounted, returned to the Battel, cutting in pieces and destroying so terribly all that durst oppose him, that all the place where he fought, lay piled with slain; so that having drawn out a thousand English Horse, he marching in the Front, Charged through the main Body of the Enemy, whilst the King Charging their Left Wing put them to the Rout, so that numbers of their Cheif Commanders and Sol∣diers being killed and taken Prisoners they fled towards the Sea where their Ship∣ping lay, but the King and Guy resolving to clear the Land of such a Plague, pursued hard after them, not without infinite slaughter, for upon the News of the Overthrow, all the Countries through which they fled, with such Weapons as they could get fell upon them, that of Thirty thousand, scarce five thousand got safe to Denmark, most of the Plunder they had gotten being likewise recovered, so great was the Victory that day. After the pursuit, the King and his Army returned to Winchester, where he would have made all the splendid provision for his unknown Champion that could be imagined, but Guy refused it, saying he had renounced all worldly Pomp, entreating his Ma∣jesty to give him leave for to depart, the which the King would by no means consent to, till he had declared his name, against which he urged many Excuses, but seeing the King so desirous, he taking him aside, told him he was his faithful Subject Guy, and that after many and various adventures which hapned in his so long wandring up and down the Earth, he was come to England for his Grave, and so happily arrived as to rid his Country of its cruel Foe, entreating his Majesty not to discover his Arri∣val to any, not so much as to his Queen, the which the King promised to observe, and with tears embracing him, after a long conference gave him Licence to depart, only binding him with promise to send him word privately where he resided, which he after∣wards
did, and the King without any Attendance came often to Visit him in his soli∣tary Cave, where he lived many years. So humble was the Warriour whose Renown, And mighty Deeds, might justly claim a CROWN.
CHAP. XVI. Of Phaelice her behaviour for the absence of her Lord, how she came to have knowledg of him, of his and her Deaths a uals the descript on of their Tombs and Epi∣taph, how Guy's Sword and the Trophies of his Conquests were hung up in the Ca∣stle. PHaelice, not all this while having heard of her Lord, remains pensive and sad, her only Recreation being to releive the Poor, who in numbers still flock about her
Gates for Alms, the which she liberally distributed with her own hand, often enqui∣ring of the Pilgrims that came from the Holy Land, if they had heard of one Guy her much loved Lord, and they answer no; she would turn away and weep concluding he was dead, and then breaking out into passionate expressions, complain of her hard Fate, which Guy himself in disguise often hearing, his eyes growing thereupon full he would turn aside and weep to bear her company, many times receiving Alms at her hands, and resolve not to discover himself: But at last finding Valours strength decay, and that death approches fast, he thought fit to send the Marriage Ring according to his promise, being much desirous to behold her once more before he dyed; so that espying a Traveller coming towards his Cave, he called to him, and out of all love desired him to do so great a favour as to carry a Ring to the Countess of Warwick, and if she re∣quested of him to direct her to his Cave, he doubted not but she would largely reward the utmost of his demands: The man at first seemed very unwilling, as not knowing what it should mean, making many excuses, till Guy pressing more and more affirming that he meant no ill, but that the Countess would gladly receive his message; he at last un∣dertook it, and Posting to Warwick Castle, knocked loudly at the gate, desiring to speak with the Countess in her proper person, for such was his Commission, no sooner she being come, but bowing low, he delivered her the Pledge of dear Remembrance, the which she no sooner saw but knew it and wept for joy; and ordering her servants to give the Messenger an Hundred Marks for the good tidings and went with him to the Cave where her Lord was, who espying her though feeble and weak, went out to meet her, where they embraced each other, not being able to speak for a md space, till Guy thus expressed himself. Alas my Love, I see thou hast well obeyed my will in every point, with joy since my return, I oft have heard thy praises told, how vertuous and chact thou hast re∣main'd and above all, took pleasure to releive the poor, my self disguised, having re∣ceived Alms from thy hands unknown. It was I that free'd England from the cruel Danes, and ever since have had my Lodging in this Cave, oft fed on Roots and drank Water from the Brook, shedding tears for true Repentance for my crying sins, and now have made my peace with Heaven; he would have proceeded but she interrup∣ted him, and fetching a deep sigh cryed: Ah my dear Lord, and could you be so cruel to your mournful Phaelice thus long to conceal your self from her that with such earnest∣ness enquired after you, but in vain, no news of you e'r reached my longing Ear: A∣las said Guy it was for the welfare of my immortal Soul that I made not my self nor solitary dwelling known, nor should I now have done (though Heaven knows I love thee above all earthly things) had not this mortal sickness seized me, and according to my promise I desired to embrace thee once before I dye; weep not my Love, tis but a
short space and we shall meet in Heaven never to be seperated more; this being no soo∣ner said, but a fit of his Disease seized him he fell into a swound, whereupon she with much rubbing and sprinkling of water in his face, with the assistance of the Travellor, brought him to life again; then sending for her servants, ordered them to fetch all manner of Cordials, and would have removed her Lord to his Castel, but he would in no wise consent to it, saying, he had chosen that silent place quietly there to resign his breath, the which he did accordingly in two daies after, commending his immortal soul into the hands of his great Creator, leaving her sole Possessor of all his worldly Goods to dispose of them as she thought good, during which space of Life she would not leave him, but warched with him in the cold Cave, and no sooner perceiving his immortal soul had taken slight, but she cryed, Ah cruel death then wilt thou let me slay, no I will but follow my dear Lord to his Eternal place; which said, she in the height of Distraction beat her snowy breasts, tore off her golden hair, and mangled her face, and had done greater violence had they not restrayn'd her; then embracing the dead Corps, she fell into a swound, which her servants perceiving, conveyed her with the body of her departed Lord to Warwick Castle: Long it was not before the fame of Guy's death (that great Champion of the World, whose equal Europe could never boast of since or be∣fore) spread through the Land, whereupon the King and Queen left York and came to Warwick to give order for the Burial of so Renowned a Subject, and like wise to com∣fort his of consolate Lady; but could not effect the latter, for she shun'd all converse, delighting more in solitary Darkness than in Light, refusing either meat or drink for three dayes space; in the mean while Guy's Corps by the King's order was Imbalmed, ad all the Castle hung with mourning to the ground, but while they were sumpteously preparing for his Funeral, the Countess through extream grief fell into a violent Fever of which in despight of Art in a short space she dyed, and breathing out her Soul, cryed, now my Lord with joy I come to enjoy thy company for ever in bright Mansions far above the Starry Skies. This renewed the former Grief throughout the Nation, each exclaiming against the Tyranny of Death, who had bereaved them in so short a space of the most Renow∣ned pair the Nation ever bred, the one for Matchless Deeds in Arms, the other for matchless Beauty and Vertue. The King gave order to Erect a spatious Monument over the Tomb designed for them, on which was Carved Guy's Noble and Heroick deeds with both their Ima∣ges, lying as it were a sleep,, whilst Angels strewed Roses and fragrant flowers around them, and placed Garlands on their heads: The time of the Solemnity be∣ing come; all the Nobility in England in Mourning attended the Beirs, the King & Queen being chief mourners, whilst the Trumpets sounded dolefully before them,
and the Priests their Requiems Sung, their bodies were laid hath Tombe, and this Cpitaph was infixed, &c. EPITAPH. Under this sacred Pile of Marble Stone Doe lye the Wonders of the World, whom none Could ever match, her's War and Beauties Pride, The far-Famed Bridegroome and his lovely Bride. Great Mars and Venus here Entombed lye VVhose Names Immortal are and cannot Dye. After this, the King caused Guy's Sword with which he fought most of his dread∣ful Battels withal, the Head of the Dragon killed in Northumberland, and the R of the Dun Cow, with several other Trophies of his Conquest, to be hanged up in Warwick Castle; as likewise on Cloth of Arras, the full proportion of the Monstrous Dragon which was about thirty foot in length; appointing a man a yearly Sallary to keep them, some of which are remaining to this day, and may be seen for the better sa∣tisfaction of the curious or incredulous of the Age, which will hardly be induced to be∣lieve that ever such Worthies were, though Scripture it self makes mention of seve∣ral.
