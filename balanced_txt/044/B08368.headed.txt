The Anatomie of the inward parts o  lively set forth, and diligently, declaring the principall V  the use of letting Bloud: very necessary for Physicians a ¦rurgians, and all other that desire to know Themse The signification of such Letters as are placed in the Figure. A SIgnifieth the gullet of the throat, called also the throatbole, in Latin Gurgulio, and Canna pul∣monis, that is to say, the Lung-pipe and Wes∣on pertaining to the lights and the heart conveying ayre to them both, and it divideth it self into many hollow pipes within the Lungs, as ye see, B Signifieth the Lungs or Lights, called in Latin pul∣mo, and it is called the bellows of the body, for it draw∣eth and sendeth forth again the ayre, with the which the heart and other members are tempered: wherefore the Lungs be full of hollownesse, even like a spunge, and empty, opening itself to the receiving of ayre, and ga∣thering itself together to expell it again, as doth a pair of bellows, fashioned much after the shape of an Oxe hoof. C. Signifieth the Heart called in Latin Cor, the seat of life, the ruler and directer of the spirit and bloud. It ap∣peareth within against the left breast, it is figured round, tending to sharpnesse at one of his ends, the which is to∣wards the breast: it is of all other members the principall, and is called the Sun of the less world: For man among Philosophers is called the less world, and the heart being in it, is to all the body as the Sun is to all this great uni∣versall world, which approaching neer unto us, all things rejoyce, herbs bring forth flowers, trees spread their branches, all fowls, fish, and beasts, receive great com∣fort  the heart in man being heavy and pensive, all the b  sad and ill disposed: The heart again be∣ing glad  merry, all the body is light and lusty, for it illuminat  and lightneth all other members with his spirit. It  he first member in man that receiveth life, and the la hat dyeth. Only this part in man is never griev bly with any disease, but if it be, forthwith it dyeth and all the man with him. D. Signifieth the Middriffe, called Diaphragma, Sep∣tum transversum, and Praecordia, and it is a thin skin which divideth the upper part of the body from the ne∣ther part, that is to say, the Heart and Lungs from the Spleen and Liver, &c. E. Signifieth the throat-pipe, called in Latin Gula, and Interior Colli fistula, that is to wit, the inner pipe or cunduit of he neck, the which cometh from the neck  ck, and thorough it is conveyed the meat and  by the mouth is sent into the stomack. And  pe doth appear above the shoulders, where also the throat-bole is seen, there it is called the throat, and the outward pipe of the neck, And this part of the same pipe shewing it self in the bulk of the body, is cal∣led the inward part of the neck-pipe and throat-pipe. F. Signifieth the upper part of the mouth of the sto∣mack, called in Latin, Os stomachi. G. Signifieth the stomack, called in Latin Stomachus, the receptacle of meat and drink, a place devised of na∣ture to concoct and digest food, as a furnace wherein meat is sodden; and it is offended with many and sundry diseases. H. Signifieth the bottome of the stomack, the (meat being in the stomack, undigested) is very and the same being once decoct and digested, it  it self again. I. Signifieth the nether mouth of the stomack  issue of the same called in Greek pylorus, and co∣ly in Latin Protonarius, the way by which the m digested, passeth down to the guts. K. Signifieth the Liver, called in Latin Hepar ¦cur, this is the place where the juyce coming of n ¦gested in the stomack is transmuted and alter  bloud: but that part of this juyce, which is no converted to bloud, is altered part to flegme, p  ¦ler, and part to melancholy. L. Signifieth the Gall, called in Latin Fel:  receiveth the refuse and dregs of the bloud, an ¦veth chiefly to the laps of the Liver. M. Signifieth a certain vein, called in Latin,  and Manus jecoris, that is, the hand of the L vein receiveth the digested juyce, by divers,  the stomack and other bowels, and sendeth  ¦choly part into the Spleen. N. Signifieth the Spleen, called in Latin  Lien, which is the receptacle and sink of mel O. Signifieth a vein, which in Latin is called  and Vena jecoraria, the hollow vein, the vein  for by this Vein the bloud ingendred in t  ministred to all parts of the body, to nouris  therewith. P. Signifieth the Kidneys, called in Lat  fastened to both sides of the body near to the L  the right Kidney standeth somewhat highe  left; by those the watry part of the bloud  drawn, descendeth thorough certain other v  see in the bladder. Q. Signifieth the bladder, in Latin Vesica,  and receiver of urine. R. Signifieth the Stones, called in Latin Tes this is the place where seed is ingendred. S. Signifieth the Cods, called in Latin Scr T. Signifieth the privy part of man, call ¦nis, in whom be two notable waies or issu  one is the urine issue, the other is called th . V. Signifieth the smal guts called in Latin Il is ingendred the cruell pain, called the gnawin in the belly. X. Signifieth the grosser and greater part  in Latin called Colon, in whom the excrements  long withholden, receiveth a certain form  after the place. This part many times is or  the collick. Y. Signifieth the latter end of all  which immediately the ordure is expell  Fundament. This place many times i  disease called the Piles or Emeroids,  Latin is named Longanon.
A Declaration of the Letters, signifying the principall veins to let blood THe Veins of the forehead and the temples, do spring and grow of the exteriour throat-veins, like branches, the which must be opened, drawing the Launcer overthwart the vein. I call it let∣ting overthwart the vein (according to antient Doctors) the which is not fully along the vein, nor fully over∣thwart the vein, but keepeth a mean between both: and the letting bloud of this vein is good for apostems in the eyes, and the Megram, and for great head-ach, and for alteration of the wit, for Frensie, and for the new leper. B. The veins of the neck (that commonly are called the veins Guiden, or Jugulare exteriores) must be opened overthwart the vein, letting the Launcer decline a little along the vein, but not too much; or else it should be hard to stanch the bloud. And he that shall open this vein well, must cause the Patient to bow his head from that side where he will open the vein, that it may be bent. And this vein must be opened (as saith Avicen) with a Launcer (cum pilo) that is to say, that hath a pin over∣thwart about the end of the Launcer, to keep it from go∣ing to deep in the vein: And the letting bloud of these veins is good for the humours of the head, for the Rheume, and the Megram. And it is to be noted, that all the veins of the head ought to be left after a man hath eaten; neither ought these veins to be let in those, in whom is required the power to ingender. For (as saith Avicen) through these veins are voided the spirits that nature doth send forth for generation. C. The Vein on the outside of the arm, the which the new practisers commonly do call Cephalica, and Galen, Vena externa and also Humeraelis, taketh his originall with the Guiden or Jugulares exteriores, from the hol∣low veins. And this vein Cephalica must be opened with a greater hole than the other eins, or else (as saith Haly abbas, the antient Physit in the fourth book of his practise) the foresaid vein  ous to fall to an apostumation. And great heed  be take for failing in opening this vein, for it is rdous to let. For if you dare not touch this vein Cike, and fear to open it as some Barbers and Chyrurgeans that be not well expert, do, ye shall do great harr to the Patient, and cause danger of apostumation. Alwaies if ye touch this vein well at the first lancing, it is the same that of all veins doth grieve least in letting of bloud: howbeit how∣soever ye do, make the hole meetly great. The opening of this vein is good for running of the eyes, and all man∣ner of head-ach, and for the falling sickness. D. The vein that appeareth in the middle of the arm, before the bowing of it, or after the bowing, the which commonly is called the Median or Mediana, or Nigra, after Avicen, or after Haly abbas Mediastina, and after Rhasis and Almansor it is called Vena matrix, or Car∣diaca; and hath his originall or spring, partly of the Ce∣phalica, and partly of the Basilica, the which must be o∣pened overthwart the vein; or at the least declining the Launcer a little awry, except one will let twice; and the letting bloud in this vein, is good for all griefs and dis∣eases of the members, stomack, ribs and sides, for it is the fountain of all the body. E. The Vein that is common called Basilica, and after Galen, Vena interna, sometimes it is called Jecor∣ria, others do call it Hepatica, or Regia. Rhasis, because it doth go thorough the armholes, doth call it Vena axil∣laris: and it doth proceed and come from the hollow vein being yet in the breast, before it hath furnished the Inte∣riores Jugulares, or throat-veins. The originall of this vein is of the stomack, liver and heart, and the best perceiver is in the outside of the arm. Of the which vein, he that shall open it, ought to take diligent heed for laun∣cing, for hard by it is a great sinew like unto a vein, wherein the spirit of life runneth up and down, and is mixt with bloud, the which if it be opened, the Patient stan∣deth in jeopardy of his life, as saith Galen in his book of letting bloud. Under the same Basilica are also great si∣news touching the foresaid vein. Therefore saith Rhasis in his 28. book, eschue the Basilica as much as possible, without it be for great need, otherwise it is better to take the Median. F. The Vein that appeareth upon the top of the pulse, is the branch or twigg of the Cephalica. G. The second vein that lightly appeareth about the middlemost finger, and is commonly called Funis Bra∣chii, is also a branch or twigg of the Cephalica. H. The third Vein of the hand, the which appeareth about the little finger, and is commonly called of the Physitians or Chyrurgeans, Salvatella, or Vena Titilla∣ris, or Ascelaris, is also a branch of the Basilica. The which veins of the hand, as also other outward veins are of small value or profit to be let bloud or opened, be∣cause they never yield much bloud: and these must be opened as those of the feet, namely in warm water, to cause the veins to swell above the sinews. I. The vein of the inner ankle of the foot, the which appeareth more perfectly than the other, is commonly called Saphena, and cometh (as doth also the Sciatica) from the great hollowness that is under the knee. K. The other Vein that is on the outside of the foot, is called Sciatica, and cometh likewise of the great hol∣lowness under the knee. And the letting bloud of these two veins, is good for all manner of swellings and apo∣stems of the privy members. The which veins of the feet are jeapardous for deep launcing, and especially the Sci∣atica, which is more dangerous to be touched than the Saphena. For if ye open the Sciatica and launch it deep for fear of failing, because they appear so small, ye shall hardly escape, but that ye shall touch some sinew adjoy∣ning to the same veins, whereof might come great pain and other evil accidents: as we have seen otherwhiles, that for ignorance of the Barbers and Chyrurgians, the Patient did fall into divers griefs of the sinews or the cramp. This and such like griefs therefore are the causes, why it is needfull to have the hands and feet in warm wa∣ter, when they shall be lanced, to cause them to swell and appear the better: for they be little of themselves, and in giving them a cut with the Launcer, ye must alwaies be∣ware of the sinew. Also the Sciatica must be launced as the Saphena, namely, a little overthwart, seeing they ap∣pear enough. And generally every vein that is in a place full of sinews, or between sinews, must be opened along the vein, and that for two reasons. The first is, to eschew the sinews in what place soever they be. The Second is, that the vein that is cut or blemished along the vein, is not so dangerous for the cramp, or other evil accidents (as saith Galen in his fift Book of Methodus Therapeu∣tice) as when it is launced along a little overthwart. Behold (Gentle Reader) these are the Veins that, are commonly inured to be cut. There be many other Veins that may be cut for divers griefs; but because they are little in use, and Galen and other antient Greeks have made no mention of them, let this suffice.
