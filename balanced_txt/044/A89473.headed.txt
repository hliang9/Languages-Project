THE MANIFEST Presented to the Parliament in Scotland, in regard of the present troubles in England;Revel. 16. Psal. 89.119. Acts. 17. Isay 11.32. according to the eter∣nall Righteousnesse of God, the Soveraign Iudge. And that they may take heed of causing a new Desolation of the Poore, by inter-medling with the judgement of God. Psalme 10. THere is no other Gospel,Galat. 1. Iohn 1.13.15. Rom. 12. Colos. 3. 1 Cor. 12.13. but that which God hath caused to be published by his Servants of old, namely, That every Member of the body of Christ ought by putting on hearty compassion, of the love of God, to have a tender fellow-feeling and care of the sufferings of his neighbour or fellow-Member. And if every Angell from Heaven should preach Gospel otherwise,Philip. 3. 1 Pet. 1.2 1. Io. 2.3.4. Colos. 2. Ephes. 4. Zephan. 3. Isay 52.54. Acts 20. Gal. 1.5. Colos. 2. 1 Pet. 1.2. Hos. 4.10.12. Rom. 16. Ier. 23.30. then God hath caused it to be taught or preached in former times by his servants the Apostles, and Prophets; Namely, that the true Belie∣vers are so fitly ioyned and compacted together, that they ought, and doe mutually help or supply one another, for the increase or im∣provement of the whole body, as the universall, temporall, and eter∣nall welfare of the Church of God, or the Members of the Body of Christ, doth require the same; let such a one be accursed together with his vaine, false, and perverted doctrine, outward Temple-service, or pretended Worship of God. Ieremiah 7.8. Whereby the bond of the Love of God being untied, there ensue such Divisions still, that there is none at all doth care or trouble himself any more for the trouble and sufferings of another, or for the affliction of Joseph. Amos 6. According to this Gospel now,Rom. 1.2 Cor. 5. where the Righteous is not to live on∣ly
to himself,1 Pet. 4. Gal. 3 John 8.12. Ephes. 1.2. Colos. 1. 1 Peter 1. 1 Cor. 1.3.15. 1 Pet. 1.2. Rom. 1.9.11. Isay 48. Matth. 24. Marke 13. Luke 21. 1 Thes. 5. Isay 45.49. Ps. 14.73, 97.102. Isay 33.52.59, 60, 61. Psal. 75.89. Acts 17. Romans 14. But in the spirit unto God, and especially by, or of his Faith, Habakuk 2. Hebrewes 10. and to walke in the light, whereunto also he is redeemed, and delivered from the power of darkenesse, and dearely bought by the blood of the Sonne of God. 1 Corinthians 6.7. They in England, Scotland, and Ireland, which doe call themselves Christians, according to the Covenant of the second or new Testament, and have the Word of God, and would be coun∣ted his people by the same, Titus 1, they should long agoe alreadie, by reason of the great Trouble and Tribulation of Mankind, Daniel 12. have lifted up their heads, desisted from sinnes, or workes of Darke∣nesse, been made free, or become sober from them. 1 Corinthians 15. And thus have soberly observed or given heed for the Deliverance of Israel, to the worke of the Lord. Psalm 28, Jsay 5. or the helpe out of Zion, Romans 11. For which end God timely sent his servant David, whom he raised in that behalfe to judge, Ieremiah 30. to come into the Land or Kingdome. Revelations 16. But because they were asleep there,Dan. 12. 1 Thes. 5. Math. 24. Luke. 18. 1 Tim. 1. Gal. 5. 1 Cor. 12.13. John 13.15. Hezek. 22. 1 Iohn 3. Iames 3.4. Hebr. 10.12. Amos 5. Ieremiah 30. Isay 47. Revel. 16.17. 1 Pet. 2. Hezek. 13. 2 Tim. 3. Rom. 16. 2 Pet. 2. Zach. 10.11.13. 2 Tim. 4. Rom. 1. Revel. 20. Marke 13. and the King of Eng∣land would at no time take the Kingdome and Iudgement of God, Daniel 2.7. for the deliverance of his Elect, into consideration, ac∣cording to the Law and Testimony, Isay 8. or in his own conscience, so as he and his were bound to doe out of a true, unfeigned, Christi∣an Faith, and through the Love of God, that incorruptable seed, 1 Peter 1. Romans 12.13. Therefore hath God also caused the fire in manner foretold, to be thus kindled upon him and his like, by the Ca∣nicall, envious, Titus 3. self-revengefull and implacable proceedings of the Parliament there, who were altogether as farre from conside∣ring the oppressed in Germanie, but suffered those their fellow-Mem∣bers to sinke and perish, Soule and Body under the Babylonian Yoake or Abomination, and instead thereof went about, even against God and Christ, only to vindicate or avenge themselves, 1 Corinthians 4. and to maintain and establish the Hypocrisie and lying of the dis-uni∣ted, distracted, 1 Timothy 1.6. divided, Hosea 10. Sectarian, and con∣tentious courses of their Shepherds, Ieremiah 23, and temporall or worldly Teachers, whom they have raised and heaped upon them∣selves
after the manner of those mischievous,Ier. 7.17.19. Ps. 10.12 94. Zach. 1.10. Habac. 3, Psal. 12.80. Mich. 2.3, 4. Hezek. 22.34. yea Divellish Ty∣rants, Isay 29. Psalme 52.68. Theeves and Murderers in Germany, Isay 1.9.34. through whose godlesse, insolent, fierce, and bar∣barous deportment, ad was turned afterwards to prey and ruine, Nahum 2.3. which must needs be judged yet, by reason of the Desolation of the poore, and for the shedding of so much innocent blood by it. And forasmuch as God will no longer endure hereupon his Earth, that robbing, & murdering in this false Hierusalem,Zach. 5.9.10. Matth. 21.24. Rev. 3.16.22. Isay 24.26.41.66. Marke 11.13. And much lesse, yet the Hypocrisie of those lukewarme, neither hot nor cold, false practises and professions, Psalme 9.50.96.98. Whereby men suffer one another to sinke and perish,Zephan. 3. Ier. 30. espe∣cially in matters concerning the Soule and Conscience, on which depends the universall, temporall, and eternall welfare of Man∣kind;Revel. 6.12. so as it hath been likewise practised in England,Hezek. 12.32. Luk 12.17.21. Mat. 24. Marke 15. when they have worried and destroyed one another, besides the leaving of their neighbour destitute and helplesse; therefore it behooveth those in Scotland, to open the inward eyes of Conscience to good purpose, & to look well to it, what they are about,Nahum 3. Ier. 2.7.22. Rom. 12. or how they are to carrie themselves in regard of their present troubles and war∣like Commotions, whereby Sathan is let quite loose now,Ephes. 4. Iames 3.4. Hebr. 10, 12. Psal. 10.94. Mich. 3. Revel. 20. with rage and fury Psalme 2.76. murther, theft, or robberies and bloodshed committed on the innocent; and that they doe not further emancipate or subiect themselves, 2 Peter 2. to the selfe-revenging, Cainicall, 1 Iohn 3. fierce, envious, Titus 3. and impla∣cable Murther, and plunder-Divell, Revel. 16.20.21. to fley, and destroy the poore people and Inhabitants of England. Souldiers indeed there will be required yet,Ioel 3. 2 Thes. 1. Wisd. 5. Rev. 18.19.22. to serve God in the execution of his vengeance or iealousie, Isa 9. Iudgement and Righteousnesse; The Method or proceeding whereof would be this; That such as will eschew the wrath of God (the King of England,Ro  and other his like in Authority) doe so order their Government according to Conscience, in the first place: as th bound by God and Right to doe in the behalfe of their own,
Subiects, Wisd. 6. Isay 32. and then also, that they be aiding and assisting their suffering or oppressed neighbour or fellow mem∣bers for their deliverance.Gal. 5. 1 Cor. 12.13 Luke 17.18. Isay 24.26. Daniel 12. 1 Thes. 5. Mal. 3.4. Mat. 24. 2 Pet. . Rev. 16.17.18. Isay 49.60. Which hitherto, for the unbelief, and Gods contempt of the spiritually Dead Revel. 12.20, that sleep in sin, were forced to perish soule and body; for which cause many shal awak, & rise again with everlasting shame & confusion. For ther is no peace at hand in the world yet, Hezek. 13. neither for those under the great Babell or Babylonian Whore, Isay 47.52 63. nor for any other unbeleevers, and ungodly Hypocrites, Scoffers and Scorners. Ep. Iude. But if so be, the Princes and Iudges, Governours or Officers of Scotland will likewise not observe this present and last time accor∣ding to the Law and Testimony of their Conscience,Mich. 5 Wisd. 6. D. 8.11.12. Luke 21. Isay 8 51.59 Ierm. 30. Hezk. 22. Isay 45. Amos 5. Zeph. 1.3. Psal. 33.68. Hosea 10, Isay 8. Isay 8. nor looke upon the universall, temporall, and eternall welfare of man∣kind, in their present confusions, great troubles and calamities, Marke 13. according to Iudgement and Righteousnesse, the very like may befall them, that hitherto befell others, whose condition they resemble. For God, who hath both light and darkenesse in his hand i as easily able to kindle the fire among them also. Ha∣ving suffered none yet, where he sent me, to prosper in their purpo∣ses, humaine devises, or consultations, against his everlasting Councell. Given according to Truth and Righteousnesse,Psal. 89.97. Acts 17. Mich. 7. Wisd. 5. (Amos 5.) Where∣by God will see the Nations of this world judged, Isay 51.59. At Edinburgh in Scotland, 1648. FINIS.
