CHARLES by the grace of God, of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland, King, Defender of the Faith, &c. To all to whom these Presents shall come, Greeting. WHereas in the time of this unnaturall Rebellion, our owne Ships and Vessells belonging to our Royall Navie have bin traiterously seized upon, and those and divers Ships and Vessells belonging to others, as∣well Strangers as our owne Subjects, have bin and still are imployed against us, or in the service of the Rebells in Armes against us, by carrying or conveying of Armes, Ammunition, Money, Victualls, and other Provisions for their aid
and assistance, or by exporting from them Money, Bullion, Plate, or prohibited Goods, without licence, contrarie to the Lawes; or by trading and carrying of Goods and Merchandize for trade and commerce, to and from those parts, Cities, Townes, and Places which are under the usurped Powers the Rebells in Armes against us: And likewise by paying Customes, Subsidies, and Imposts, to the said Rebells, contrary to the Lawes, and our Proclamation in that behalf, which affoords them meanes and ability towards the maintenance and upholding of the said unnaturall Rebellion. And whereas divers of our good Subjects adhering to us, have suffered great losse and dammage by the said Rebells, and their Ab∣betors aswell upon the Land as upon the Sea, for which they can have no remedie in ordinarie course of justice, in regard those that have done the same, are kept out of the reach or hand of justice, by the Powers and Forces so traiterously raised against us. And whereas in these times or distractions divers Pyrates, and Sea-Rovers commit great spoiles and outrages upon our owne Sub∣jects, and the Subjects of our friends and allies, and divers of our Subjects of our Kingdome of Scotland, have most perfidiously and traiterously risen up in Rebellion, and taken up Armes, against us their naturall Leige Lord and Soveraigne, and have in a hostile manner invaded this our Kingdome of England. And whereas divers Ships and Vessels as well Scottish, as others, are imployed at Sea in their aid and assistance, in manner as afore∣said. And whereas upon those occasions we have been forced to set out Ships at our own great charge, for our owne defence, and the defence of our loyall Subjects, and preventing the mischiefs be∣fore mentioned, and have likewise thought fit to give all encourage∣ment to any of our good Subjects which are willing and desirous to set out Ships at their own charges for and towards the weaken∣ing and suppressing of the said Rebells, and more particularly to those our good Subjects who have sustained dammages by the said Rebells, either at Land or Sea, to the end they may obtaine some recompence or satisfaction for their said losses. And whereas we are informed that Sir Nicholas Crisp Knight, hath suffered great losse and dammage in the time of this unnaturall
Rebellion, by the said Rebels, their Adherents, or Abettors, as well at Sea as upon the Land. Know yee therefore, that wee reposing speciall trust in his, the said Sir Nicholas Crisps fidelitie and circumspection, wher∣of we have had verie good experience, have given and granted, and by these Presents do give and grant unto him, the said Sir Nicholas Crisp, and to such as hee shall take into Partner-ship and Consort-ship with him therein, full power and authoritie, at his and their owne charges to set to Sea, out of any of our Ports of our countrey of Cornwall, or out of any other our Ports or Havens whatsoever, fifteene or twentie ships, or vessels or war, or any other number of ships and vessels, not being lesse than fifteene, equipped, victualled, fitted, furnished, and marined for war. And, wee doe hereby give unto him the said Sir Nicholas Crisp full power and authoritie to command in Chiefe, as Ad∣mirall of the said ships, and other vessels, and men in them, ei∣ther in his owne person, or by his Substitute, and to nominate and appoint Vice-Admiralls, Reare-Admiralls, Captains, Com∣manders, and Officers, in the said ships, as shall be necessarie for each ship. And, we do hereby give unto him the said Sir Nicholas Crisp, and to such as shall be employed by, or under him, in this ser∣vice, full power and authoritie with the said ships so to be set out by him and his partners, as afore-said, or any of them, to take, seize, or surprize, or in case of resistance, or where neces∣sitie requireth, by fight to compell, and take into his or their possessions, or destroy any of our owne ships or vessels, set forth without our Commission, Warrant, or Leave. And also, any other ships or vessels belonging to what person, or of what place soever, which are or shall be employed in any service for any of the said Rebels, of either our said Kingdomes of Eng∣land or Scotland, or of any their Aiders, Abettors, or Adhe∣rents; and all goods and merchandice in them contained; and all ships and vessels which shall be employed in importing, car∣rying,

the Ordnance, tackle, and furniture of the same, or belonging thereunto, be taken and restored to Vs as aforesaid: And al∣lowing also to the said Sir Nicholas Crisp his Partners, Asso∣ciates, the goods & merchandices in any such of our own ships or vessels, to be made prize and divided amongst them, in such manner, and under such reservation to Vs, as other goods and merchandices taken in any other ships or vessels ought to be, according to the tenour of this our Commission. And we do also hereby give and grant to him, the said Sir Nicholas Crisp, his Partners and Associates, that it shall and may be lawfull for him and them, to retaine, use, and employ such of our said owne ships so to be taken and surprized, till we have made payment of the said five pounds per Tun to him or them for the same, without any account or satisfaction to be made to Vs for the same whatsoever. Excepting also further, and reserving to Vs all tenths heretofore used to be paid in ca∣ses of like nature to the Admirall of England, and all Customes and duties due, or accustomably paid for and upon any the said prizes which we will shall be paid and accounted for to us, and to our use: Provided alwaies, that before any of the said ships or vessels of war so to be set out by him the said Sir Nicholas Crisp, his Partners or Associates, shall go out of the said Ports, Havens, or Harbours aforesaid, upon the said employment, the said Sir Nicholas Crisp shall cause the Captaine, Master and chiefe Mate of everie of the said ships, to enter into a bond or obligation of the penall summe of one thousand pounds to Vs, with condition thereupon, that they, nor either of them, nor any their company employed in the said ship, shall wittingly, or knowingly, rob, spoyle, hurt, or endam∣mage any of our Subjects, or the Subjects of any of our friends, or allies, other than such of either of our said Kingdoms of Eng∣land and Scotland, as shalbe in Rebellion against us, or shal be Abettors to the said Rebellion, or have, or shall pay Customes, Subsidies, or Impost to the said Rebells, contrary to the Law, without our speciall licence or allowance; or shalbe imployed in aid or service of the said Rebells, or any of them, or which

And likewise, that all Ships by them taken, and surprized, with their furniture, goods, and lading, shall be brought intire, without breaking bulk, into some Port of our Kingdome of England; now or then in our possession and obedience, except in case of apparent danger of the Rebells Ships: In which case it shall and may be lawfull to carrie the said Ships, or Vessells, or any of them, into any Port of our Kingdome of Ireland, or into any other Port of any Forragine Prince, or State in league or amity with us; and there to be and remain till the same shall receive sentence, and adjudication of any of our Courts of Admiralty, or Vice-Admiralty, in such manner and upon such testimony, as if the said Ships and Goods were in any of our owne Ports and Harbours, so as a true inventory valuation and apprize∣ment of the said Ships, and Vessells, and of their goods & ladings, be first made & delivered into the Court of Admiralty, or Vice-Admiralty, where the proceeding, sentence or adjudication touching the same shall be. And forasmuch theas setting out & finishing of the said Ships of Warre cannot be done without the great charge and expence of the said Nicholas Crisp, his Part∣ners, and Associates, and may probably conduce, not onely to and for the reparation of the losses and dammages by them sustained, by the said Re∣bels, but may also much tend to our Service,
by weakening the trength of the said Rebels, destroying their trade, and suppressing this present Rebellion. We do therefore hereby further grant unto him, the said Sir Nicholas Crisp, and such others as he shall receive into his asso∣ciation and partnership a aforesaid, that none of the said ships, or vessels of war, so by him or them to be set forth, shall be im∣prested, commanded, or employed upon any other service for Vs whatsoever, save only to fetch or convey Armes, or Am∣munition from forraine parts into this Kingdome, for our spe∣ciall service. And that only by warrant from Our Selfe, un∣der our Signe Manuall, and then not to stay in any Harbour a∣bove twentie dayes, and to be paid for everie such voyage accor∣ding to the rate of foure pounds per month for everie man to be employed in everie such voyage.

or take into his or their consortship, any other ships or vessels, as well of Forrainers in amitie with Vs, as of our owne Sub∣jects, upon the best conditions hee or they can contract or agree for the same with the Owners thereof; and to employ and use them in the said service. And Wee do like wise give unto the said Sir Nicholas Crisp, his Partners and Associates, full power and authoritie from time to time, and as often as hee or they shall think fit and re∣quisite, or conducing to the service, to land Forces as he or they shall think fit, in or neere unto any place or places within any our Dominions, where any Insurrection or Rebellion is, or shall happen to be, and to suppresse such Rebellion; and in case of opposition or resistance, by fight to subdue, or destroy all such Rebels and Traytours; and to appoint such Commanders over such part of the Forces as shall there be landed, as afore∣said, as shall be by him or them thought fit.

And to punish mutinies, tumults, rapines, mur∣thers, and other crimes which shall be committed and done by any person or persons, under his charge or command, either upon the Sea or Land, according to the course and usage of the Sea, or of War, as the case shall happen to be.
And we do hereby require and command the Judge of our Court of Admiralty, and the other Judges of their severall Vice-Admiralties within our Kingdome of England and Dominion of Wales, or elsewhere, according to this our Commission, they forthwith proceed to sentence, or adjudication of the same with speed and effect, as good and lawfull prize, without any unne∣cessary delay, which may turne to his or their prejudice.

And we do also hereby desire all others, aswell Admiralls, Vice-Admiralls, Captains, and Officers, and other the Subjects belonging unto any Prince or State now in amity with us, to be aiding and assisting to us as occasion shal require, to him the said Sir Nicholas Crisp, his Partners, and Associates, and those under his or their command, in the execution of this our Commission. And we do hereby also require and command the Judge of our Court of Admiralty, for the time being, upon Request made by him the said Sir Nicholas Crisp, for that purpose, to grant unto him the said Sir Nicholas Crisp, and to the Captains or Commanders of every the Ships to be set out, or imployed as a∣foresaid, severall Letters of Marke, or Reprisall, or Commissi∣ons of that nature, under the great Seale of our Court of Ad∣miralty, enabling them for taking prizes according to the sub∣stance of this our Commission, to the end the said Commissi∣on may have and receive the greater countenance, authority, and esteem in Forraigne parts beyond the Seas. And further know yee, that we putting speciall trust and confidence in the said Sir Nicholas Crisp, and being assured of

And do hereby require all our Officers and Ministers, to see the same observed according. And our expresse will and and pleasure is, and we do hereby charge and command the Judge of our Admiralty, and of every Vice-Admiralty, where any the said ships, goods, or merchan∣dize so agreed, or contracted for, shalbe brought, that they shall proceed to sentence or adjudication of, and upon the said ships, and goods, as if the same had been taken and seized upon by force and strength at sea.

And our will and pleasure is, and we do hereby declare, that this our Commission, and the Powers, Liberties, Licence, Au∣thority hereby respectively given and granted, shalbe and con∣tinue in force for and during the space of two whole years next ensuing the dare hereof (if this Rebellion should so long conti∣nue) and no longer. In witnesse whereof Wee have caused these our Letters to be made Patents; Witnesse Our Selfe at Oxford, the sixth day of May, in the twentieth yeare of Our Raigne. Signed Willis. Per ipsum Regem.

To the Committee for the Navie. Noble Sirs: WEE present you here one peece of the Enemies care by sea, the readi∣nesse of their undertakings, the willing acceptance of such tenders, the coun∣sell they have, their present executions, their engaging of their whole partie, even as far as Poperie reacheth, and as low as Hell; for from this Commission, the Dunkirk and Ostend Frigots get theirs, and act vigorously: some have formerly said of England, That the sea could give lawes to their forraine and do∣mestick broyles. Wee therefore desire that you would look upon this Criticall yeere, and upon such meanes as God hath betrusted you withall. Remember the sea (in former times) hath ever danced under our vessels laden with victorious trophies from abroad; let us not be baffled at our doors, the ships and sea-men are yet yours, 'tis a great prize: God keeps all the world upon the hinges by his coun∣sell;
States and Kingdomes must keep their work on the wheeles by the same way; this Kingdome will never be delivered by Law, but Men, who being good, carrie Law in their bosomes. Shew your selves now, if ever, to save a gasping Nation, that after-ages may say, There was a blessed, faithfull, State-saving Committee of the Navie: The Lord help you and us. AMEN.
