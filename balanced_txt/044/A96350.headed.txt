THE FIRST CENTVRY OF Scandalous, Malignant PRIESTS, Made and admitted into Benefices by the PRELATES, in whose hands the Ordination of Ministers and government of the Church hath been. OR, A Narration of the Causes for which the PARLIAMENT hath Ordered the Sequestration of the Benefices of severall Mi∣nisters complained of before them, for vitiousnesse of Life, errors in Doctrine, contrary to the Articles of our Religion, and for practising and pressing su∣perstitious Innovations against Law, and for Malignancy against the PARLIAMENT. IT is Ordered this seventeenth day of November, 1643. by the Com∣mittee of the House of Commons in Parliament concerning Printing, that this Booke Intituled, [The first Century of Scandalous, Malignant Priests, &c.] be printed by George Miller. JOHN WHITE. LONDON, Printed by George Miller, dwelling in the Black-Friers, M.DC.XLIII.
To the READER. Reader: THis ensuing summary Declaration, of the Grounds and Causes, whereupon this Parliament hath proceeded against di∣vers Ministers, to sequester their Be∣nefices from them, and to place in their roomes, godly, learned, orthodox Di∣vines, diligent Preachers of the Word of God, may serve thee for many excellent parposes. First, To open thine eyes and clearely convince and satisfie thee, that the Parliament had good, and very great cause from hence, a∣mong many other things, to declare and resolve, that the present Church Governement by Arch-bishops, Bishops, their Chancel∣lours, Commissaries, Deanes, Arch-deacons, and other Eccle∣siasticall Officers, depending upon the Hierarchie, is evill and justly Offensive and burdensome to the Kingdome, a great Im∣pediment to Reformation and growth of Religion, and very pre∣judiciall to the State and Government of this Kingdome, and therefore to be taken away See the Pre∣amble of the bill for the As∣sembly of Di∣vines, and of the Ordinance by which they sit.: They have beene by our Lawes entrusted with the Care and Provision for the soules of the King and Subjects, to heed, feed and watch over them Acts 20.28. 1 Pet. 5.2. Heb. 13.17.: And to attend upon the great Embassie they pretend unto, to pray and beseech them to be reconciled unto God 2 Cor. 5.20.: and to preach
and to cause to be preached by able and faithfull men 2 Tim. 2.2.: The Word of God in season and out of season 2 Tim. 4 2.: They have not onely neglected their Personall Execution of this weighty trust, but also have generally and mostly committed the same to Per∣sons illiterate and insufficient, dumbe Doggs, as the Scripture calls them Isa. 56.10., that cannot barke, against whom God hath pro∣tested for their ignorance Hos. 4.6., and to men swallowed up with Wine and strong drinke, whose Tables are full of vomit and filthinesse Isai. 28.7.8. Quorum ess. et vivere est esse & bibere.: Whoremongers and Adulterers, who as fed Horses neigh after their Neighbours Wives Jer. 5.8.: Buggerers that change the naturall use into that which is against Na∣ture Rom. 1.26.. And to others scandalous of corrupt mindes, and ill affected to the Peace and Safety of the Kingdome, men unfit to preach to, or live among Christians, their wickednesse being so great, as that they are condemned by Heathens: And hereby they have taken the high-way to destroy the souls committed to them, and to drown them in Perdition. The evill life of a Minister, being like the rods, which Jacob spread before the Sheepe Precepts are iter longum. Examples iter breve., the people write after his copie with ease and confidence. Sinnes are reputed, as none, or as veniall, which receive Patronage from the Mini∣sters Example Hae hominum faces non Dei ministri, sed Satanae satelli∣tes, non Christi seblatores, sed Antichriste successores.. And though some few of these Church Governors, have been men that have otherwise expressed in the course of their lives a true feare of God, yet by a strange Influence of the Divine Curse upon their Offices, branches of the Hierarchy of Rome, plants not planted by our heavenly Father, these as well as the rest, have unhappily laid hands suddenly upon many, and preferred divers wicked and unworthy, by partiality 1 Tim. 5.2., to marry and put off their hands a Daughter, a Kinswoman, and upon other bie and base re∣spects, without regard of the good of the soules of them, over whom they were set. And in this Booke, thou shalt have an Assay of the Gall and Worme-wood of the Episcopall Governement, taken out of London the Metropolis, and of the Counties adjacent, that when thou seest what Vermine crawles upon, and devoures the prin∣cipall and vitall parts, thou maist reflect with a mournefull heart up∣on the more miserable condition of Wales, and of the North, the more remote parts of this Kingdome, where upon scrutiny will be easily found, many for one as vile and abhominable as these. And if thou wouldost have the people perish for want of vision or impoyso∣ned
with the destructive Errours of Popery and Arminianisme, and the Land yet more defiled with cursing, swearing, drunkennesse; whoredome, sodomie, then put thy shoulders still to the support of the said Church-Government and Governours, but if thou be better minded (as in Charitie I hope thou art) then joyne heart and hand with the Parliament, to purge out such Popish dreggs, and together with them, pray for and endeavour a through Reformation, accor∣ding to the word of God. Secondly, Thou maist by perusall of this booke clearly see what manner of persons those Cleargie-men be, that favour the present course of his Majestie against his Parliament and people, and dislike and maligne the wayes of the Parliament, they will appeare unto thee to be such as cannot endure the purity, power and strictnesse of the true Religion, that hate Reformation, and to be brought in their hearts, Religion and lives to the holy Word of God, that seeks themselves and not the things of Jesus Christ, that are given over to vile affections, to superstition, ambition, persecutions, cove∣tousnesse, malignity and all wickednes, and knowing the judgement of God and what they deserve that commit such things, yet not only doe the same, but have pleasure in them that doe them Rom. 1.28, 29 32.. Thirdly, Thou maiest hereby discerne one principall ground and cause of the generall ignorance and debauchery of the Gentry and people of this Kingdome. Like Priest, like people Hos. 4..: They cause the people to erre by their lyes and by their lightnesse Jer. 23.31.: They are a snare on Mispah, and a net spread upon Tabor Hos. 5.1.. They have wrested and broken the law of the Lord, defiled his holy things, hid their eyes from his Sabbaths, polluted his Sanctua∣ry Ezek. 22.26., and seduced the people to the same wickednesse, dawbing with untempered Morter Ezek. 13.10. These Prophets prophesie falsly, the Bishops beare rule by their means, and the people love to have it so Jer. 5.31.. Fourthly, Behold with admiration, and acknowledge with love and thankefulnesse the transcendent mercie of the Lord, to his poore people among us, that whereas he hath infinite just cause to destroy these Priests and people together, cloath them with desolation, and doe unto them after their waies, and judge them according to their desert Ezek. 7.27.. He is graciously pleased to stirre up a spirit of zeale and judgement in the Parliament to deliver the people from the mouthes of these Shepheards, that feed not the flocke, but kill them that are
fed, eate the fat, and cloath themselves with the wool Ez k. 34.3, 10.: and to set true shepheards over them, to seeke that which was lost, and bring againe that which was driven away, to bind them that were broken, and strengthen them that were sick, and to feed them all, with know∣ledge and understanding; and to feed with judgment the wicked shep∣heards that before with force and cruelty ruled over them Eze. 34.15, 16.. Fiftly, Behold with comfort and assured expectation of good from Heaven, that as the Lord hath manifested his gracious purpose to re∣forme his Church in this Land, and set up the Kingdome of Christ among us, in the purity of Doctrine and Discipline, and hath for that purpose called this Parliament, fixed it, set it upon that worke, and maintained it therein, and in all these hath manifested his im∣mediate hand and finger, in stupendious works of Divine provi∣dence, opening obstructions, working that himselfe which his ser∣vants could not, making the very enemies of Reformation meanes to further it; discovering and preventing the horrid, hel∣lish, treacherous plots of his and our enemies, turning the coun∣sells of Achitophell into folly, discovering the rotten hearts of them, that said they were for the Cause of God, but are found ly∣ers; and holding up the hearts of his faithfull ones in the middest of, and against all discouragements. So the Lord is pleased to carry on his great worke of Reformation, in the very face and in aispight of all oppositions and dangers, that it gaines ground and creepes on every day. These Priests of Baal, sonnes of Be∣liall, that know not the Lord, whose sinne is very great before God, in making multitudes abhorre the Offerings of the Lord 1 Sam. 2.12, 17., are taken away and removed as filthy rubbish from the house of God. The Antinomians that destroy the Law, as neither di∣rectory nor obligatory of a Christian to duty: and teach, that God sees not, is not angry with, will not correct, requires not sorrow for, nor repentance of the grossest sinnes that are commit∣ted by such as beleeve they be in Christ; and that the elect are actually justified as soone as borne, though they have not faith in forty yeares after, and many such absurdities and barbarismes in Divinity, are questioned and in a good way to be suppressed, and the Doctrine of our Church in a great part cleared from all aspersions and misconstructions. This is the Lords doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes. And certainely these works of
God, are so many earnest-pence unto us, as the first fruits to the harvest, that God will in his own way and time perfect his said worke of a through Reformation, and bring forth and lay the head and top∣stone thereof, that we and our postority shall rejoyce and cry grace grace unto it Zech. 4.7.. Sixthly, Whereas in severall Proclamations, Declarations and Pamphlets set forth in his Majesties name, and otherwise sent us from Oxford, the Parliament hath been exceedingly reproached and condemned (as in truth they have been for all the good they have done for the Kingdome) for Sequestring the Livings of Reve∣rend Divines (as they stile them) thou mayest by a serious peru∣sall of this Booke, cleerely see what Divines the Authours and pub∣lishers of the said Pamphlets doe so reverence and esteeme; And from thence observe of what spirit these men are that side with, ho∣nour, pleade for, and receive unto them such Priests of Baal, of Bac∣chus, of Priapus; Doth not their affection unto, and high esteeme of such uncleane beasts, abundantly evince, that they serve and prosti∣tute themselves unto the same dung-hill Idols and filthy lusts, and that they are all of the same Father? And note further, that these Li∣bellers not only speake evill of Dignities, but also of those things that they know not Jude 8.10., they Censure the Supreame Court of Judicature, themselves being Delinquents, deferving the severest judgement, and that without hearing them, or informing themselves of what they have done, notwithstanding all their acts and proceedings lie fairely of record in their Journall bookes, obvious to every man that desires to understand the same. And that the Parliament may appeare just in their doings, and the mouth of iniquity may be stop∣ped, this Narrative of the crimes, The grossest faults stand proved by ma∣ny witnesses, seldome lesse then six. and misdemeanours of those sons of the earth are here published, that all the world may see, that the tongues of these that speake evill of the Parliament, are set on fire of Hell, and lift up against Heaven, and that they hide themselves un∣der falsehood, and make lies their refuge. And let not the Learning of some few of these men (for wch if they had any grace to use it well, they were considerable) move thee to thinke they be hardly dealt with, for learning in a man unsanctified, is but a pearle in a Swines snout, Arrins, Pelagius, Arminius, all of them learned, but thereby the more serviceable to doe mischiefe in the Church; like Curio, who was facundus only ad reipublicae per∣niciem. Learning and knowledge we honour in any, but vitiousnesse
and lewdnesse we condemne in all: had some of these men sanctity of life as well as light of knowledge, they had been honourable to Reli∣gion, and usefull to soules; but their abhorred lusts casting out of them the guidance of light, it is but justice to cast them off from be∣ing guides to others: I say, Justice to them, and withall mercy to the poore people, who at once are ridde of a plague, and enjoy a blessing, are freed from such who poisoned their soules, and supplied by such as take care to feed and save their soules None succeed these sequest. red Priests, but such as are ex∣amined and ap∣proved by the Assembly of Divines.. I know well that all we say or doe in this particular will be reproa∣ched by some, but good services must not therefore be deserted be∣cause reproached. When the fat Abbies were taken downe in Henry the eights time, the Friers cried out that holy Church was destroyed, yet when the draughts and ponds were searched, so many bones and skulls were found, which assured men of practises distant enough from holinesse. For my part I shall not cease to endeavour and pray for a perfect reformation of the Church, which is the garden wherein God delighteth to walke, and therefore must be purged of all stin∣king and noysome weeds. And doe thou (whosoever thou art, that fixest thine eye on this display) learne by the evills which thou readest, to bewaile the greater evills in this sinfull Land which thou yet dost not know The follow∣ing Centuries will make a more full Dis∣covery of the wickednesses that are among us.: When malice hath spoken its worst and done its utmost, then shalt thou cleerely understand what I daily see and cer∣tainely know, that the great services and paines of the Parliament have no other scope but divine glory, the Churches reformation, and the Kingdomes safety. Consider sadly and seriously of these things, and the Lord give thee and me understanding of these times, to know what Israell ought to doe in the same; and let us without feare of the hand of violence, or foote of pride, set hand and heart, and shoulder and all, to the perfect cleansing of the house of the Lord, and advancing his Sion to a perfection of beauty, and setting up his Christ upon his Throne, to rule over us in all things according to his own mind, and then expect with fulnesse of assurance, that he will speedily make all his enemies his foot-stoole, and ease himselfe and us of all his adversaries. Which is the prayer of him that desireth to spend himselfe and be spent in the service of the King and Kingdome,JOHN WHITE.

The Benefices of Nicholas Andrewes, Doctor in Divi∣nity, Rector of the Parish Churches of Guilford, and Vicar of Godalmine in the County of Surrey, are sequestred, for that he is not only negligent in preaching himselfe, but hath also ex∣pressed himselfe to be an enemy to frequent preaching, inveigh∣ing in his Sermons against long Sermons, saying, that Peters sword cut off but one eare, but long Sermons like long swords, cut off both at once, and that the surfet of the Word is of all most dangerous, and that the silliest creatures have longest eares, and that preaching was the worst part of Gods worship, and that if he left out any thing, he would leave out that, and refused to give the Parishioners
leave to have a Lecturer to preach unto them, and hath presen∣ted his Parishioners that went to heare Sermons at other Chur∣ches, when they had no preaching at home; and caused the Church-wardens and Sides-men to be presented, for not pre∣senting such into the Ecclesiasticall court: And in delivering the Bread in the Sacrament, he elevateth it, lookes upon it, and bowes low unto it, and useth other frequent bowing in admi∣nistring the Sacrament, and in his Sermons greatly exclaimes against that Doctrin which teacheth, that the greatest part of the world should be damned, and frequenteth Tavernes, and con∣sumes his time in sitting and tipling there: And hath refused to publish the Order of Parliament, concerning the remo∣vall of superstitious and Idolatrous pictures and Images, and hath substituted to officiate for him in the said Cure, very scan∣dalous and Malignant Curates, viz. Bacock, Leverland, Pastor∣loe, Heath, and one Blane, who is in the Army raised against the Parliament, and when his people have propounded honest and Orthodox men to be his Curates, he hath refused them. 22. The Benefice of Ephraim Vdall, Rector of the Parlish Church of S.

And when hee did preach, his Subject was mostly in exalting of holy ground, and pressing the practise of the said illegall Innovations, and he forced divers women that came to be churched to come up to the Altar; and there to ducke and kneele unto it, and at their comming and going from it, and had made his Parishioners, not onely to cringe to the said Table, and come up to the Rails, but also to offer money there unto him, holding a bason for the fame purpose on his knees, commanding them so to offer their gifts.

Rome above them all. And that this is my Body in the Sacra∣ment of the Lords Supper is to be understood in the literall sense, and that there is a Transmutation of the bread and wine into the body and bloud of Christ, as in John 2. the substance of water is turned into the substance of wine. And that the words, Doe this, are spoken to the Priest to create the body of our Lord, affirming, the Priest to to have power to create the very body and bloud of Christ, and that it is lawfull to invocate Saints and Angels, and that Infants dying after Baptisme, become Interceders, even for their Parents: And that auricular Confession to the Priest is absolutely necessary to salva∣tion, once a yeare, or at least once in a mans life.
