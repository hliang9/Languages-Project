A true and reall Manifestation of endeared and unfeigned Love flowing through a Brother, from the endless Life, Unto the Scattered, (yet United) flock who are of the SEED ROYALL. OH! Yee living Branches of the trve Vine; yee Children of the day whose light is come, on whom the glory of the Lord is risen, yee hungering Lambes and little ones, and thirsting soules after righteousness, and all yee in whom true desires are begotten, after the knowledge of the Lord; and whose faces are turned towards Sion, more especially to all yee amongst whom I sometimes have had my Conversation in the Gospel of Christ Iesus the light of life; unto you all, (without respect of persons) endeared everlasting love, from melt∣ing bowells, from me freely flowes and reaches, and in which receive the dear Salutation of me your Brother, fellow Travel∣ler and Companion, towards & in the promised Inheritance; and now a Prisoner for the Testimony of that Truth and Gos∣pel which in the fulness of time hath been in the demonstra∣tion of the Spirit and Power of God revealed and declared in and amongst you; yea in fulness of love and life am I even constrained hereby to salute and imbrace you: and let you know that I am yet alive, & that that life & power lives in me which shall subdue Death it selfe; & him that hath the power of it, in which life power and love I earnestly desire and wish that grace mercy love, life and peace eternal, may be abun∣dantly shed abroad and multiplied in and amongst you all. Oh! my dear and evrlastingly beloved Brethren and Sisters, what shall I say or what words shall I use to express my love vnion
and nearness to and with you, yee bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh, & love of my life; surely I am full, yea I am full of Love towards you, and have (even as it were) travelled in pain for some time waiting to bring forth a manifestation of it: And now truly rejoyce that the time is come for me to ease my self unto you, and the gates being set open, let my love swiftly run forth towards you as a mighty Stream that runs down a steep Hill, and beares down all opposition before it; When I looke back and call to minde the day, when the Lord uttered his Voice a∣mongst us, and when his call reached to his own in us, & when he bowed our hearts to answer his call, and when I with many of you turned my face toward Sion, and began to advance out of Egipt, and took our Journey together through the wilderness in a path unknown unto us; yea, my dear hearts, when I remem∣ber now in this time of my restraint & Captivity, what freedom and liberty once I had amongst you, when I went with joy & gladness with them that kept holy-day, when I assembled a∣mongst the little ones of my Fathers family to wait upon him, and when somtimes as the least of his little ones, I Ministred before him amongst you out of that euerlasting Treasury from whence I received a portion to distribute, when he uttered his Voice through me, and when his witness in many of you an∣swered and testified it was not the voice of a Stranger; When his glory even filled his house, and his presence appeared in the midst of us to the shaking of the earth removing the mountaines and rending the rocks, when his living streams swiftly run through the little vallies, and watered and re∣fresh't his pleasant heritage, when the broken in heart were bound up, and comfort and glad tidings Proclaimed to Sions mourners, when the Lambes skipt upon the mountaines, and the morning Stars rejoyced together, when with one accord from the life Eternal, in its dominion we breathed forth pray∣ses
unto Sions King, yea when these things are set before me in this my captive (yet contented state) verily, my bowells are even turned within me, and in remembrance thereof mine heart affects mine eyes, and mine eyes answers my heart, and oft teares plentifully runs down upon my Bed in the night season; Oh my deare and pretious ones! feele yee my melting, panting, yearning bowells over and towards you; Let not my teares be spilt in vaine in remembrance of you, what though I am here shut up, and numbred amongst transgressors, and seperated from your sosciety? yee know it is only for bearing record to the living hope begotten in you, even the hope of Isra∣el: Oh! how can I forget the Lords pleasant Heritage, whose beauty, whose love hath even overcome me; yee excellent ones, surely my delight is in you, my vnion, my fellowship, my life is with you, nay if I forget you, (in whom my soule re∣joyces, and in whose love I am foulded) then let the pittifull tender mother forget her innocent tender Infant of a span long, the fruite of her wombe which shee hath brought forth through sore pangs and sorrow; yea then let mine eyes forget to guide or direct my feete, and let my right hand forget his service for its fellow members, for if I forsake or turne my back from the little ones of the Campe of Israel, when in the wilderness in the day of tryal, when Amalecks forces approa∣ches near them, yea or at the Lyons mouth or Dragons Den, then let my right hand be dryed up, and my peirceing sword (which the Captaine of Israells hoste hath girt about me) re∣turne into mine own bowells, and let the sharp Arrows of my Bow (which abode in its strength when the Archers shott at me) swiftly pass through my own Breast, yea then let the e∣nemy persecute my soule and take it, and lay mine honour in the dust, and tread my life down to the ground, and let me be as them that goe down to the grave and shall never see light,
nay yee are written and sealed in my hearts love with inde∣ligable Characters, even as with the poynt of a Diamond, in the bright pollished Marble; what instrument or power shall ever be able to raze you out; or make a separation between us! yea though my outward man be here in bondage, my love, my life, my spirit is at liberty; and on a rock am I set above mine Enemies, my Tryalls and Sufferings (wherein my spirit) I oft behold the Innocent Lambs, feeding in the pleasant pas∣tures, under the good Shepherds conduct, and drinking at the living Fountaine, where I see the harmless little ones feeding in the Banqueting house in the Fathers presence; & the Banner of love displayed over them, & where I truly feed drink & am refreshed with and among them, to my unexpressable joy & great delight; yea the Innocency of the Lambes, and simpli∣city of the Babes oft times even overcomes my heart with love unto them, and the spirit of Courage and Valour which my God hath raised up in them in this day of his power, (by which they are made willing to Ieapard their lives in the high places of the Field) even fills my soule with joy, and my mouth with songs of prayses for them; Oh dear Lambes! let me have a habitation amongst you, and in your love and life let me have a resting place, yea stretch forth your Armes to im∣brace my breathing soule; and let your hearts be open to re∣ceive my love, for I am your Brother, one of your Mothers Children, let me be near unto you; And further my dearely beloved Brethren and Sisters, let me put you in remembrance that the enemies of your everlasting peace are many, subtill & Potent, yea when I have beheld the rageing sea, casting up her Monsters, when I have reviewed the strength of Amalecks Ar∣my, with the Midianitish wiles, the long wilderness uninha∣bited, and the unknown path to be passed through, with the many Bryars and Thornes, fiery Serpents and wild Beasts,
the sons of Anak to be overcome, and fenced Cities to be won in the ardency of my spirit, and fervency of love, my soule even cryes Lord preserve the Innocent and upright in heart, & carry thy little ones in thy Bossome, & let thine everlast∣ing arme encompass them, for what Power, what Wisdome, can deliver from those Enemies & lead through those straites difficulties and distresses, but the Power and Wisdome of the Lord of Hostes. And therefore in all estates and conditions whatso∣ever, let your eye be unto him, from whom alone salvation comes, and in diligence and faithfulness waite upon him, that with his wisdome and power yee may be throughly furnished, by which yee may be able to encounter with and overcome all hardships, and enemies whatsoever; for truely dear hearts, when I veiw the strength, the subtilty, the vigilancy and cruelty of these Enemies, my heart would faint, but that I also see and know the worke is the Lords, and his power is over all, whose councel shall stand; Who is bringing up his chosen with joy, and his redeemed with gladness, to the mountaine of holiness and habitation of Justice, where the weary find rest, and the hungry and thirsty are plentifully fed and refreshed and nourished up and preserved unto everlasting life, and where salvation is appointed for Walls and Bullworkes. And therefore Oh yee seed of Abraham! and little ones of the house of Israel, lift up your heads and rejoyce, feare not neither be yee dismayed, looke yee not out at enemies, neither their power, malice, subtilty, nor rage, but stay your minds in that light that first convinc't you of sin, waite very diligently in it, and be faithfull to its leading and commands in the least ap∣pearance, although you may (as to the outward), suffer great loss by so doing; and take diligent heed to watch against that which would draw your mindes from it, under what couler or pretence soever; Deare hearts take heed of selfe in every thing,
for its in League with the Prince of Darkness, and is a chief Leader in his Army; selfe love, selfe wisdome, yea, beware of the wisdome of the flesh, which will some times exercise it selfe in the things of God, and will be prying into & try∣ing, & examining, & judging, that which it understands not; but in the end it betrayes Simplicity and Innocency, beware of selfe Exaltation under what shew soever, but keep to that which keeps you in the Cross to the carnall part, that yee may dye daily thereunto, yea remember the time of your first love, and day of your espousalls, when the dread of the Lord was over you, and when you durst not utter words untill tryed and Judged, when simplicity and Innocency was sought after, to be Guid and Leader. Oh then Unity and Love increased, and the little ones grew strong in the Lord, Take heed of Covetousness, of the mind, secret stealing againe into the Earth, beware of haste and rashness in any thing, but let the meeke and gentle Spirit, Guide and Leade in every thing, and be kind and ten∣derly affectioned one to another, bearing and forbearing each other in love, looking alwayes to the better Part, where the u∣nity stands, unto that which in your selues discovers secrets, but covers and hides infirmities in the Brethren; and if any be overtaken with a fault take heed of hasty Judging & Reprov∣ing, for that will not restore, but in Pitty and Love beare; Ve∣rily when I have beheld the strong, subtill and many Enemies that the poore weake and little ones have to encounter with∣all, many strong Lusts and riseings within, and great temp∣tations and tryalls without, by which many times they are overcome, and sore wounded, my soul in secret is even melted and drawn out in love and pitty towards them; and gladly could I help bear their burthens and War against their Enemies! yea my life would not be dear unto me to save a Lambe from the Lyons mouth.
Let bowels of love reach one to another in every condition, And yee that have of this worlds goods, shutt not out from you the sence and feeling of others wants, but waite to have that eye open that beholds & feeles others necessities, yea let your bow∣ells be drawen forth to the hungry ond needy, that their bowells also may bless the Lord for you; & take heed of excuses when truth & necessity requires your aide; what if some be slack & negligent herein, let others be So much the more bountifull & liberall by such example to provoke or make them asham∣ed, that it may appear that the earth is under your feet, and that you are Children of the Lord, because you love the Bre∣thren, and in all that the sence and feeling of the love of God towards you reach forth one to another as the root and off∣spring of all, then shall peace extend to you as a River, and righteousness run down as a mighty stream, then shall there be noe mourning nor complaining in our streets, nor begger in our Israel, but Unity, joy, and gladness within our Habitati∣on, Oh its a blessed thing to have an open heart and liberall hand; a sacrifice well pleassing to the Lord. And deare hearts, take heed of that eye that will watch for evill one against another, or be too watchfull to spye others faults, take heed of suffering prejudice or offences to arise in any case within you, for if it once have got footing there, it is not easily removed, & if that which is evill in another rise against any of you, Then diligently watch over your own hearts, least the same evill rise in you and contend with the other, And this doth but gender strife & breake Unity; but in case of wrong or injury done against you, seeke not too ea∣gerly to vindicate your selues (though inocent) but in Gods wis∣dome, true patience and love to the offender, beare and for∣beare, and suffer wrong rather then to increase discord, wait∣ing patiently on the Lord, who in due time will clear your
innocency as the light. And so all dwell in love together, & let the God of peace an Unity rule in your hearts forevermore. Then shall your hearts be filled with joy and gladness, and your mouthes with joyfull praises, Oh praise the Lord forever, and exalt his Name in the Congregation of the righteous, for he hath done marvelous things, he hath regarded the low estate of the poor and needy, he hath heard the cryes of the Oppres∣sed, and sighing of his Prisoners, and with his Arme hath he brought Salvation, and with his own right hand hath he gotten himselfe the Victory. Oh! yee Innocent and upright in Heart, lift up your heads and be glad in the Lord, for his Councel concerning us shall stand, that he will never leave us untill he hath set us in full Possession of the promised Inheri∣tance: Settle it in your hearts that he hath not raised us out of the dust and brought us hitherto, now to let us fall in the wil∣derness, and give us over as a Prey to our Enemies; What then shall become of his great Name which he hath exalted and is exalting in the sight of the Nations, and for which it is that he hath done these great things for us? not for your sakes nor worthiness, (Oh Seed of Israel) hath he remembred his Covenant with you, but for his own name sake hath he wrought deliverance for you; yet know this for your consolation, for your sakes will he reprove Kings in the day of his wrath, and poure contempt upon Princes, yea and (rather then his worke of deliverance shall saile) will overthrow Kingdomes & Nations if they stand in his way: praise him forever, and give thankes in remembrance of his hollyness, for it becomes the just to be thank∣full, and praise is comely for the upright, And when you draw near unto him make mention of your Brother before him, that his loving kindness may be continued towards me, and I pre∣served in faithfulness to him, and Vnity with you all, yea let all my true hearted Brethren and Sisters know, that he hath
dealt very bountifully with me, and all his waies have I found to be Mercie and Truth unto me, for when by his grace he first called me, I obtained Mercie to be found faithfull, and when through my Labours and Travells in his Vineyard wherein he set me, my Testimony for him there was finished, and my outward strength near exhausted, he gathered me to my expect∣ed rest in peace, and though mine Enemies (in eager pursuite of their malice and envy) causelessly cast me into this Iayle a∣mongst theeues and evill doers, yet my God had a designe of Love towards me in it, who hath made it a very pleasant Ha∣bitation, and is himselfe become a little Sanctuary unto me, where in his presence I am preserved in perfect joy and peace, having the Testimony of his spirit in many of you of my faihtfull service for him towards you, and the same Testimo∣ny also in my selfe that I never consulted with flesh and blood, or disputed his Commands when and where ever he sent me, and that I this day stand clear of the Blood of all men; And now my dear and pretious Ones, in veiw of your goodly Tents & pleasant Habitation I leave you, and with plenty of teares I kiss and imbrace You, my heart being as ful of love towards you, as when I began to write, for while the streames thereof swiftly runs unto you, such is my simpathy with and nearness to you, that I am filled with the Returnes of Yours to me, it be∣ing as natural to my heart to receive it, as the parched ground the drops of raine; Oh bless yee the Lord for me, and let us magnifie his Name together. Well then dear hearts, in your love am I even rouled as in a Garment, and bound with everlasting cords, and sealed in a per∣petuall Covenant which out lasts the day and night, in this love let me live, yea in it let me dye, yet in the same I shall out live death it selfe, where (in his everlasting Armes who is love, and who never slumbers nor sleeps) I rest and so∣lace
my selfe with and in you, And so receive yee this as a token of that indeared love flowing forth from me which shall abide when I shall be no more, but yet a hope lives in me that he shall once againe see the faces of many of you Who is Your dear Brother (a Prisoner for the hope of Israel) JASPER BATT. Evilehester Goale the 18th of the 10th Month, 1661.
