TO THE CHRISTIAN READER. ALthough at the first publishing of this lit∣tle Catechisme, I cal∣led it a Method, only to distinguish it from other bookes of the same argument: yet since, it hath put me in mind to auoid some repetitions. But especially I haue respect to the be∣nefit of the simple, for whose sakes I haue cut off many particular questions, and made the rest (where I conuenient∣ly could) shorter and plainer. For the same cause I haue set down fewer quo∣tations, and those for the most part out of the new Testament, because the Rea∣der might with more ease turne vnto them. And although the most part doe let the quotations stand as ciphers in
the margent,To reade and exa∣mine the places of Scripture set downe in the mar∣gent, a most profitable exercise. neuer searching the Scrip∣tures, according to the example of those noble and worthie Christians, mentioned in the Acts, 17.11. yet I would aduise thee Christian Reader, to reforme the common fault, and with all care and diligence, to turne to the places which are noted, that thy faith and conscience may bee groun∣ded, not vpon the speeches of men, but vpō the words of the holie Ghost: to whose gratious and comfortable direction I commend and commit thee now and euer. Thine in the Lord Iesus, ST. EGERTON.
PLACES OF SCRIP∣ture, shewing the necessitie and antiquitie of Catechi∣zing, aswell priuately, as publikely. Testimonies. THese words which I command thee this day shall bee in thy heart,Deut. 16.6.7.8. and thou shalt rehearse them continuallie (setting an edge vpon them) vnto thy children: and thou shalt talke of them when thou tariest in thy house, &c. For precept must be vpon precept,Esai. 20.18. pre∣cept vpon precept, line vnto line, line vn∣to line, there a little, and there a little. Therefore leauing the doctrine of the beginning of Christ,Heb. 6.1.2. let vs be led forward to perfection, not laying againe the foun∣dation of repentance from dead works, and of faith to God, &c. And the Lord said, shall I hide from AbrahamAbraham. that thing which I doe?Gen. 18.17 for I

Chro. 28.9.10.And thou Salomon my sonne, know thou the God of thy father, and serue him with a perfect heart, and with a willing mind, &c. Christ. Mat. 16.15.16.17.He said vnto them, But who say yee that I am? Then Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art Christ, the Sonne of the liuing God. And Iesus answered and said vnto him, Blessed art thou Simon the sonne of Ionas, &c. And PhilipPhilip. ranne thither, and heard him reade the Prophet Esaias,Act. 8.30.31.35.36.37. and said: But vnderstandest thou that thou rea∣dest? And he said, How can I, except I haue a guide?

A PRAYER BEFORE the Exercise. MOst blessed Lord, and heauenly Fa∣ther, we acknow∣ledge and confesse before thy Maie∣stie, that wee are dull to conceiue, weake to remember, hard to beléeue, and slow to practise the wholesome in∣structions, fearefull threatnings, and gratious promises of thy heauenlie word. Wherfore we humbly beséech thée to be presēt with vs at this time, to teach vs and blesse vs, and to make this exercise of thy holy word, power∣full and profitable vnto vs. O Lord enlighten our minds, that wee may vnderstand, open our hearts, that we may beleeue, and so strengthen our memories, that we may hide and lay vp thy promises, precepts and threat∣nings
in our hearts, to keepe vs from sinning against thee. And though by the corruption of our nature, wee thinke euery good thing tedious and vnsauoury, yet we pray thee to san∣ctifie and sweeten the same vnto vs by thy holy Spirit, that we may find more comfort therein, then in any worldlie oz bodily exercise whatsoe∣uer. And grant O Lord our God, that this true ioy and found delight may make vs watchfull to redeeme the time, and constant in performing this holy dutie, to the dayly increase of faith & a good conscience, to thy glo∣rie and our owne saluation, through our Lord and Sauior Iesus Christ: to whom with thee and the holy Ghost, be giuen all honor and glory for euer, Amen.
A BRIEFE METHODE of Catechizing: wherein are handled these foure points. 1 How miserable al men are by nature. 2 What remedy God hath appointed for their deliuerance. 3 How they must liue that are deliuered. 4 What helps they must vse to that end. ¶ Certaine generall Questions.

Two things: The knowledge of God, and of our selues, wherein standeth our chiefe happinesse. Q. What is God? God. Iohn 4.24. 1. Tim. 1.17A. God is a Spirit, and king euer∣lasting, immortall, inuisible, and one∣ly wise. Q. Is there any more but one onely true God? A. No: but this one God hath made himselfe knowne to vs in thrée seue∣rall persons,Mar. 12.29. 1. Iohn 5.7 the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghost. Q. What are the workes of God? Decree. Rom. 11.36A. They are generallie thrée: wher∣of the first is the foreseeing and ap∣pointing of all things before all time to his owne glorie. Q. What speciall things hath God foreseene and appointed? Predestina∣tion. Eph. 1.4.5. Mat. 25.46A. Hee hath appointed some men (called therefore his elect or chosen) to eternall glory, & others to eternal fire.

He made man both male and fe∣male, in a most happie estate,Man. Col. 3.10. Ephes. 4.24 accor∣ding to his owne Image, in perfect knowledge and righteousnes. The first principall point. Q. Did man thus made, continue in this blessed estate? A. No: they fell from it,Mans fall. Gen. 3.12. Eccle. 7.31. and be∣came most cursed and miserable crea∣tures. Q. How did they fall? A. By the enticement of the di∣uell,2. Cor. 11.3. 1. Tim. 2.14 and their owne wilfull disobe∣dience in breaking the commande∣ment of God. Q. What came to vs their posteri∣tie thereby?
Originall guiltines and corrup¦tion. Rom. 5.12. Ephes. 2.1.A. Three things: Guiltines of their sinne, corruption of nature, and con∣tinuall sinning against God in moti∣on, thought, word and deede. Q.

How came these things to vs their posteritie by their fall? Gen. 5.3. Heb. 7.9.10A. Because Adam and Eue were the common parents of vs all, and the very stocke & roote from whence all mankind did spring. Q. Are all men sinners then? Rom. 3.10.11.12.A. Yea: all haue sinned and fai¦led of the glorie of God, there is none that doth good, no not one. Q. And are all subiect to this pu∣nishment? Ephes. 2.3.12. Act. 10.38.A. Yea: all without exception are the children of wrath, and bondslaues
of Satan. Q. How may we be touched with the sense of feeling of our sinnes? A. If we consider the greatnesse,Heb. 12.29. & 10.31. & 4.12.13. multitude, and filthinesse of them, be∣ing committed against the glorious Maiestie of God, and his most pure and vndefiled law. Q. How may we be touched with feare and horror of the punishment? A. If we consider how many and how grieuous Gods iudgements are in this life,Deut. 21.15 Mark. 9.43.44. and how intollerable and endlesse in the life to come. Q. What ought this feeling and feare to worke in vs? A. An vtter loathing and dislike of our selues,Mat. 11.28. Luk. 5.17.18. with an earnest desire and carefull labouring after the remedie prescribed in the Gospell. The second principall point. Q. What remedieRemedie. is there against this miserie? A. None at al, either in our selues,Acts 4.12. 1. Cor. 1.30. or in any creature, but only in Iesus Christ.
Christ. Gal. 4.4.5. Rom. 5.15.Q. What is Christ? A. The eternall Sonne of God, who in time became man, to repare the image of God in the elect, and to restore them to a better estate then they lost in Adam. Q. Why was it needfull he should be man? Christ man. Heb. 2.16. & 4.5.A. Because he could not haue died and answered for mans sinne, except he had taken mans nature. Q. Why was it needfull he should be God? Christ God. Heb. 4.14. & 7.25.A. Because else he could not haue ouercome death, and performed that perfect satisfaction and righteousnesse which the diuine iustice required. Q. What hath Christ done for man? Redemption 2. Cor. 5.21. Gal. 3.13.A. He hath fully pacified Gods infi∣nit anger against the sinnes of all the elect, fréeing them from sin, and death, and so is made our redemption. Q. What else? Righteous∣nesse.

reape by the obedience and righte∣ousnesse of Christ? A. By him they haue adoption,Adoption. Ioh. 1.12. Ephes. 1.5. that is, they are made the children of God and heires of eternall glorie. Q. What else hath Christ done for vs? A. He hath sanctified our nature in his owne person,Sanctifica∣tion. Rom. 8.2 1. Cor. 1.30. and doth sanctifie vs daily by his spirit, and so is made our sanctification. Q. Do men perfectly inioy al these benefits in this life? A. They are fully iustified in the sight of God,Sanctifica∣tion imper∣fect. 1. Ioh. 3.2. Rom. 9.23.24. and adopted into the number of his children, but not whol∣lie freed from sinne, till after death. Q. How then can any thing that pro∣ceedeth from vs, be pleasing to God? A. Because Christ,Intercession. Rom. 8.34. 1. Iohn 2.1 sitting at his right hand a mediator, maketh our duties (though weake and imperfect) acceptable to his father. Q. Who are partakers of these be∣nefits by Christ? A. Onely such as come vnto him,Mat. 11.28 Iohn 6.35. that is, which beleeue in his name. Q. What is it to beleeue in Christ?
Faith. Luk. 2.11..A. To he truly perswaded in heart that he is a Sauiour euen to vs. Q. What encouragement haue we to beleeue in Christ? Iohn 6.29. & 3.16. Mark. 5.36A. Because we are commanded and exhorted so to do, and for that he is of∣fered fréely vnto vs of God, with this only condition, to beleeue in him. Q. Is it for the worthinesse of our faith that we are saued? Mark. 9.24 1. Cor. 13.9A. No: (for we beleeue in part,) but only for the worthinesse of Iesus Christ, vpon whom faith laieth hold. Q. Is it in our power to beleeue? Ephes. 2.8.48. Act. 13.4. Rom. 10.17.A. No: It is the gift of God to his children, wrought in their hearts by the holy Ghost, through the prea∣ching of the word. The third principall point. Q. Seeing wee are saued onely by Christ through faith, may wee now liue as we list? Tit. 2.11.12. &c. 2. Tim. 2.19.A. No: for the Gospell teacheth vs to deny all vngodlinesse and worldly lusts: and Christ died to purge vs to himselfe a peculiar people, zealous of
good works. Q. What works are to be accoun∣ted good workes? A. Such as proceed from faith,Good works Heb. 11.6. 1. Cor. 10.31. Rom. 14.23 and be done to the glorie of God, & groun∣ded vpon the word of God. Q. What cal you the first & continu∣all work of Gods spirit in the faithfull? A. Repentance:Repentance that is, such a chan∣ging and renewing of the heart,Mat. 3.7.8. & 12.33.34.35. as bringeth forth a new life and conuer∣sation. Q. What be the parts of repentance? A. Two: that is, dying to sinne,Rom. 6.11. Ephe. 4.22.23. and liuing to righteousnes: or the putting off the old man, and putting on the new. Q. Whence do these two spring? A. From the power and vertue of Christs death and resurrection,Rom. 6.3.4.5. Ioh. 15.1.2. into whom we are ingrafted by faith. Q. Wherein doth repentance chiefe∣ly appeare? A. In the changing of the thoughts, affections, meditations, and delights.Rom. 2.28.29. Ephe. 4.22.23. Q. Why shuld we repent & do good works, seeing we are not saued by thē?
Motiues to repentance and good workes. Eph. 2.10. 1. Cor. 6.9.10. Mat. 5.16. 2. Pet. 1.9.A. Because God requireth them at our hands; and that no vnrighteous person, or vnrepentant sinner shal en∣ter into the kingdome of God. Q. Wherefore else? A. To glorifie God our heauenlie father, and to shew our selues thank∣full for all his benefits, especially for our redemption by Iesus Christ. Q. Is there any other reason? 1. Pet. 3.1. 2. Pet. 1.10A. Yea: by this meanes wee may win others to God, and make sure our owne calling and election to our selues. Q. How can we haue any assurance of our calling and election by works Iam. 2.14. 1. Ioh. 1.6.7. Rom. 5.1. & 2.29. Iohn 21.17. Ioh. 1.3.1.4. 1. Ioh. 5.4.A. Because they shew whether our faith in Christ be true or counterfeit liuing or dead. Q. What works do chiefly shew this? A. Peace of conscience, vprightne of hart, the true feare and loue of Go and our brethren, striuing against si victory ouer the world, and such like Q. What other witnesse haue the faithfull? Rom. 8.16.A. They haue the spirit of God be∣ring
witnes to their spirits,1. Ioh. 5.6.7 8. that they be the children of God. Q. Doe these witnesses neuer faile the faithfull? A.Luk. 22.31.32.56.57. Psal. 51.9.10.11. They may be ouershadowed in them by the malice of Satan, & con∣science of sinne: but neuer finally and wholly taken away. Q. Why so? A.Ephes. 1.4. Heb. 6.13. Ioh. 10.28. Because they are grounded vp∣on the euerlasting purpose, and faith∣full promise of almightie God. Q. Do our works deserue nothing at Gods hand? A. No: for they are his own works in vs, and a debt most due to him: be∣sides,Phil. 2.13. Luk. 17.10. Heb. 11.6. in vs they are spotted and im∣perfect: and finally, we are freely iu∣stified by faith before we doe them. Q. These are strong perswasions to liue godly: but is there no reward for good works? A. Yes: exceeding great,1. Tim. 4.8. Mat. 19.29 both in this life, and especially in the life to come. Q. Commeth this of the worthines or merit of our works? A. No:Phil. 3.8.9.10. but only of the free fauour
and mercy of God,Hebr. 6.10. through the merit and obedience of Iesus Christ. Q. What other spurre haue we to good workes? Psal. 116.12. Heb. 13.6.A. The liuely remembrance of Gods benefits past, and his promise of assistance in time of need. The fourth principall point. Q. VVhat meanes hath God ap∣pointed to continue and increase his graces in vs? A. They are generally two: pub∣like and priuate. Q. VVhat shall wee say of them which want these meanes? Ephes. 2 12 1. Cor. 5.12A. That their estate is very feare∣full, and for ought we know, plaine damnable. Q. And what of such as hauing the means, do either refuse or abuse them? A. That they be far more inexcu∣sable before the iudgemēt seat of God.Matth. 11.20.21.22. Luk. 7.301 Luk. 15.8. Luk. 18.1. Q. How must these meanes be vsed? A. With such sincerity, conscience, and feruency, that wée may feele fruit and comfort by the doing thereof.
Q. What are the publike? A. They are foure: prayer,1. Tim. 2.1. Mat. 28.18 19.20. the word preached, Sacraments, & discipline. Q. How may we profit by prayer? H.Prayer. Col. 3.17. Iam. 1.6.7. & 4.3. & 5.16. If (asking things lawfully only at Gods hands in the name of Christ) we come with reuerence of his Ma∣iestie, zeale of his glory, feeling of our wants, affiance to be heard, and loue to our brethren. Q. How may we profit by the word preached? A. If, being perswaded,Preaching. 1. Cor. 1.21 Mat. 13 19. Luk. 8.15. Rom. 1.16. that it is Gods ordinance, wee marke it dili∣gently, and after examine our selues what wee remember, and how wee practise that which was taught. Q. What say you of the word read? A. It is a part of Gods ordinance,Reading. Act. 13.15. 1. Cor. 14.24.25. Nehe. 8.8. 2. Tim. 2.15. & 4.2. yet much more effectuall when it is preached. Q. What call you preaching? A. When the word of God is tru∣ly expounded and profitably applied, with doctrine, exhortation, rebuke, and comfort. Q. Thus much of prayer and of the
word. VVhat is a Sacrament? Sacraments. Rom. 4.11. 1. Cor. 10.16A. It is a holy signe and seale ordai∣ned of God, to assure vs of his loue to vs in Christ, & to testifie & confirme our faith and obedience to him, & our loue & fellowship one with another. Q. How is it a signe, and how is it a seale? 1 Cor. 10.1 2.3.4. Mar. 16.15.16.A. It is a signe, because it setteth forth Christ & his benefits to the out∣ward senses of all: and a seale, because it doth effectually apply to the faithful the truth and fruit thereof. Q. How many Sacraments be there? 1. Cor. 10.2.3.4.A. Two: baptisme, and the Lords supper. Q. VVhy be there two seales, seeing there is but one Couenant? Ioh. 1.12. & 6.32.A. To assure vs, that by communi∣on with Christ we are borne againe: and shall be nourished to eternall life. Q. VVhat is Baptisme?Baptisme. Act. 22 16. 1. Ioh. 1.7.A. The Sacrament of our new and spirituall birth, assuring vs by the due sprinkling of water, that our sinnes are forgiuen by Christs blood, and we iustified by his obedience.
Q. What else doth it teach and as∣sure vs of? A. Dying to sin, and liuing to righ∣teousnesse;Rom. 6.2.3.4.5.6. 1. Cor. 15.29. it is also a pledge of the re∣surrection of our bodies after death. Q. Why are wee baptized in the name of the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghost? A. To teach and assure vs of our communion with one God in three persons.Mat. 28.19. 1. Iohn 1.3. Q. Why are infants baptized? A. Because the couenant and pro∣mise of God is made to the faithfull,Gen. 17.7. 1. Cor. 7.14 and to their seede. Q. What is the Lords supper? A. The Sacrament of our spiritu∣all nourishment,Lords Sup∣per. 1. Cor. 10.16. Iohn 6.51. assuring vs by bread and wine, duely giuen and receiued, that by Christ we shall be nourished to eternall life. Q. May al that professe Christianity be admitted as fit and worthie recei∣uers? A. No: but only such as can,1. Cor. 11.28.29. and al∣so doe diligentlie proue, examine and try themselues.
Q. Wherein must Christians exa∣mine and proue themselues? Rom. 14.23 2. Cor. 13.4 Matth. 3.6 and 5.23. 1. Cor. 5.7.8.A. Whether they know the grounds of religion, vnderstand the doctrine of the Sacraments, beleeue in Christ, hate their sinne, and loue their bre∣thren. Q. What if men cannot find those things in themselues? 1. Cor. 11.27.29.A. Then they must forbeare till God haue wrought them, vsing care∣fully all other helps appointed for that purpose. Q. What if they find them weake and feeble? Mat. 11.28. and 12.20.A. Then they may and ought to receiue, to be further strengthned. Q. What is discipline? Discipline. Matth. 18.15.16. &c.A. That order and power which God hath left to his Church to auoide offences, and recouer such as doe fall. Q. What is this power called in the Scripture? Matt. 16.19 Luk. 11.52.A. It is called the keyes of the kingdome of heauen, and the power of binding and loosing. Q. Why so?
A. Because the repentant are as it were loosed and let into heauen by the promise of forgiuenesse of sinnes,Ioh. 20.23. Luk. 7.50. Act. 8.20.37. and the obstinat bound and shut out. Q. Is it lawfull for euery man to preach and to administer the Sacra∣ments and Discipline, and to pray publikely? A. No:Rom. 10.15 Heb. 5.4. It is vtterly vnlawfull for any man, except hee bee lawfully cal∣led thereunto. Q. May we not rest in this publike meanes? A. No:1. Sam. 26.19. Ester. 4.16. Matth. 6.6 for we cannot alwaies haue them, and the word of God, and our necessitie requireth priuate also. Q. What is the first priuate helpe? A. Earnest thinking vpon profi∣table things,Meditation. Psalm. 11 9 15.52.97. Rom. 15.4. as the words and workes of God, his iudgements and mercies towards others, but especially to∣wards our selues. Q. What is the fruite of medita∣tion? A. Not onely to keepe the minde free from wicked and idle thoughts,Psalm. 12. Matt. 6.20. Col. 3.12. but also to fill it with some holy and
comfortable matter. Q. What is the second helpe? Prayer. Col. 4.2. 1. Tim. 4.5.A. Prayer, which must be daily of∣fered vp to God, that he may haue the glory of pardoning our daily sinnes, and of sanctifying our food, labours, and rest vnto vs. Q. What is the third helpe? Reading. 1. Tim. 4.13 Acts 17.11A. Reading of the holy Scriptures: which will both enable vs to the du∣ties of meditation and prayer, and make the publike Ministery more fruitfull vnto vs. Q. What is the fourth helpe? Conference. Heb. 3.13. & 10.14.A. Godly conference, instructing, rebuking, exhorting, comforting one another in wisdome and loue. Q. What is the fifth help? Practise. Iohn 7.17. & 13.17.A. A carefull practise of that we know, without which we shal neuer truly taste the vertue of religion and power of godlinesse. Q. Are the labours of our calling any hindrances to godlinesse? Ephes. 6.5. &c. Act. 18.3.A. No: but great helps, if they be porformed in due time, with consci∣ence, cheerfulnes and moderation, not
quenching the loue and care of better things. Q. How shal we attaine this mode∣ration? A. If we be truly perswaded that our happinesse consisteth not in out∣ward things,Luk. 12.15. Heb. 11.13.14.15.16. but is laid vp for vs in the life to come. Q. What helpe receiue Christians from Gouernours and Magistrates? A. Very great:Gouernours 2. Tim. 2.2 Rom. 13.3.4. for by their authori∣tie they are bridled from sin, and en∣couraged in vertue, and vnder them they liue a godly and peaceable life. Q. What wil the enioying and vse of all the meanes work in Gods children? A. A most happie and comfortable change from that which they were before, euen in this life.1. Cor. 6.11 Ephes. 5.8. Q. What becommeth of them af∣ter this life? A. The soule goeth immediatly into the paradise of God,Luk. 16.22. & 23.43. Mat. 25.46 and the body shal be raised vp at the last day, and ioyned with the same in glorie for euer.
THE FOVRE PRINCIPAL points contracted, and diuided in∣to euen parts: euery part con∣taining ten questions. Q. WHat is the estate of euery naturall man? Miserie. Ephes. 2.3. Rom. 7.24.8. Acts 23. Rom. 6.23.A. Very miserable, and in no wise to be rested in. Q. What maketh his estate so bad? A. Two things: sinne, and the pu∣nishment thereof. Q. What call you sinne? 1. Iohn 3.4.A. Euery breach of Gods law. Q. How doth man breake the law of God? Esai. 1.16. Dan. 9.6. Eze. 33.31.A.By doing things forbidden, lea∣uing things commanded, or failing in the maner. Q. What is the punishment of sin? Deu. 27.26 & 28.15. &c. Luk. 16.2.3 26. Prou. 6.16.A. All miseries in this life, death in the end, and hell euer after. Q. Is sin such a grieuous thing? A. Yea: it is the most filthie and
loathsome thing in the world. Q. How appeareth that?Esay. 1.14. A. Both by the punishment,Mark. 9.43.44. and by the person against whom it is com∣mitted. Q. Who is that? A. Almighty God,1. Sam. 2.25.

A PRAYER FRAMED according to the foure former points. ALmightie God, & most mercifull Father in Iesus Christ, as thou hast plainly set before vs our cursed e∣state,Miserie. in the cléere glasse of thy heauen∣ly word: so we beseech thee to opē our eies to see it, and pierce our hearts to feele it, by the inward working of thy holy spirit. For we, O Lord, are most vaine and vile creatures, iustly tain∣ted with the rebellion of our first pa∣rents, conceiued in sin, bondslaues of Satan; necessarilie, and yet willing∣lie seruing diuers lusts, and commit∣ting innumerable sinnes against thy Maiestie: whereby we deserue most iustly to endure all miseries in this life, & to be tormented in hel, for euer. But blessed be thy name, O Lord our God: who, when there was no power in vs,Deliuerāce. no not so much as any desire or endeuour to get out of this wofull e∣state, hast made vs see & feele in what case we were, and prouided a most so∣ueraigne
remedy for vs, euē thy deare and only begotten sonne, whom thou hast freely offered vnto vs: not onlie kindling in vs a desire to inioy him, but enabling vs, by a true and liuely faith to lay hold vpon him, and to be partakers of al his benefits, to the sal∣uatiō of our soules. And now, O Lord, that it hath pleased thee, by faith to ioyne vs to thy Sonne Iesus Christ, and by thy spirit to make vs members of his bodie: we humbly beseech thee, by the same spirit, to renew vs daily, according to thine owne image.Pietie. Work in our hearts a daily increase of true faith and repentance; and in our liues, a holy & comfortable change. O Lord, enable vs, in some good measure, to walke worthy of al thy mercies, and to serue thee, who hast created and chosen vs; and thy Sonne, who hath redeemed vs from death, and made vs heires of glorie; and thy blessed spirit, who doth continually sanctifie & keep vs, with faith, feare and zeale, in true holines and righteousnes, al the daies of our life. Finally, seeing of thine in∣finite
goodnes and mercy,Helpes. thou hast appointed diuers excellent and holy meanes for the daily encrease of thy graces in vs, and for the confirming and quickning of vs in a Christian conuersation, we humbly beseech thee to grant all those good meanes vnto vs, and to continue them amongst vs; giuing vs grace to vse them purely, constantly and zealouslie, to the glory of thy name, profit of our brethren, and saluation of our soules, through Iesus Christ: to whom, with thee O Father, and the holy Ghost, be giuen all honour and glorie for euer. Amen. A FORME OF EXAMI∣ning such as are to receiue the Lords Supper: diuided into two parts. The first part. Q. WHerefore do you desire to receiue ye Lords supper?
A. Because it is the ordinance of God,1. Cor. 11.24.25. appointed by him to confirme my faith. Q. Doe you then find weaknes of faith in your selfe? A. I do indeed find that my faith is feeble and needeth strengthning.Mark. 9.24 Q. How perceiue you that? A. By my coldnes in prayer, loue,Psal. 116.10. Rom. 10.14 zeale, repentance, and good works. Q. How else? A. By my feare of death,Phil. 1.23. 1. Ioh. 2.15. desire of life, loue of the world, and such like. Q. These do plainly argue a weak∣nesse of faith: but haue you faith at all or no? A. Yea:2. Cor. 5.1. for I am assuredly perswa∣ded of my owne saluation by Iesus Christ alone. Q. What is the ground of your perswasion? A. The ground of my perswasion is the free and gratious promise of God reuealed in the Gospell.Rom. 10.17 Q. What is that promise? A. That whosoeuer beleeueth in the onely begotten sonne of God,Ioh. 3.16. shal
not perish, but haue euerlasting life. Q. Why do you beleeue this pro∣mise? 2. Cor. 1.28 Heb. 11.19A. Because God, who hath made it, is both able and faithfull to per∣forme it. Q. God in his own nature is almigh∣tie, and most true: but what assurance haue you hereof? Heb. 6.12. Rom. 4.11.A. His word is sufficient: yet ten∣dring my infirmitie, he hath bound it with an oath, and set to his seale. Q. How doth he set to his seale? Rom. 4.11.A. By the ministery of the Sacra∣ments, which the Apostle calleth seales of the righteousnesse of faith. Q. Why doth he call them so? A. Because thereby God doth assure me (and euery faithfull receiuer) that Christ is mine,1. Cor. 1.11 2.25. with all his benefits. Q. What be the benefits, which the faithfull receiue by Christ? A. They be sixe; election, redempti∣on,1. Cor. 3.30 iustification, sanctification, adop∣tion, and intercession. Q. VVhat is election?Election. A. Our being chosen of God the Fa∣ther,
in Iesus Christ,Ephes. 1.4. to life euerla∣sting, before all eternitie. Q. VVhat is redemption? A.Redemptiō. Luk. 7.47. Col. 2.14.15. Our deliuerance from all our e∣nemies, sinne, death and hell. Q VVhat is iustification? A. Our being accounted perfectly righteous in the sight of God.Iustificatiō. Phil. 3.9. Q. VVhat is sanctification?Sanctifica∣tion. A. Our holines, begun in this life; and to be perfected in the life to come.Apoc. 20.6. Luke 1.75 Mortifica∣tion. Ʋiuificatiō. Rom. 6.11. Q. VVhat be the parts of sanctificatiō? A. Two: whereof the first is the Spirits killing of sinne in vs; and the other, his enabling of vs to walke in newnes of life. Q. VVhat is adoption?Adoption. A. Our being receiued into the number of Gods children,Ioh. 1.12. Ephes. 1.5. 1. Iohn 3.1 and into the inheritance of his kingdome. Q. VVhat is intercessionIntercession. or mediatiō? A. The vertue and effect of Christs death and obedience;Heb. 2.17. &. 4.14. whereof all the faithfull are partakers. Q. VVhy doth the Apostle say, that Christ is made vnto vs of God, VVis∣dome?Wisedome.
1. Cor. 1.30.31. 1. Cor. 6.7 Rom. 5.A. Both because our chiefe wisdome is to know him; and also because, as his righteousnesse, so his wisdome is counted ours that beleeue in him. Q. Why doth he set redemptiō in the last place, seeing Christ wrought it first? Luke 21.28. Rom. 8.23.A. Because we do not fully enioy the fruit of our redemption, which is, to be freed from all miserie, till after death. Q. And are you sure to bee confir∣med in all these, by the vse of this Sa∣crament? Rom. 10.13. Act. 8.39.A. Yea verily: for God will not faile to blesse his owne ordinance, to euery one that vseth it aright. Q. Who are they? Mark. 3.6.7.8.9.A. Only such as haue knowledge of Religion, faith in Christ, repentance for their sins, with loue to God and all men, euen their enemies. Q. Haue you all these? Rom. 3.6. 1. Cor. 13.9.A. Yea, I thanke my God, in some competent measure: though my wants be many and great. Q. What hold you concerning God? Knowledge of GodA. That he being infinit, aswell in
his iustice, as in his mercy,Rom. 6.23. cannot but punish sinne with all seueritie. Q. What hold you concerning man? Knowledge of man.A. That he being by nature a mise∣rable sinner, cannot escape this seue∣rity of God, without some singular and soueraigne remedie. Q. What hold you concerning Christ? A.Christ. Acts. 4.12. That there was none in heauen or earth but he alone, that could both satisfie the iustice of God, and make vs partakers of his mercy. Q. What hold you concerning the holy Ghost? A.Holy Ghost. 1. Cor. 6.15.19. That by him we are ioyned to Christ, as members of his bodie, and made partakers of all his benefits. Q. What hold you concerning Faith? A.Faith. Ioh. 1.12. & 3.14.15.

That wheresoeuer true Repen∣tance is, there is true faith also.
Q. What thinke you of faith?Faith. 2. Cor. 13.5.6.A. That whosoeuer hath true faith, is a liuely member of Iesus Christ. Q. What thinke you of Iesus Christ? Christ. Iohn 1.12.A. That euery member of Iesus Christ is the child of God, and heire of his heauenly kingdome. Q. What conclusion gather you from hence? Rom. 9.1. Repentance.A. That whosoeuer doth truly re∣pent, shall neuer perish, but be saued euerlastingly. Q. How appeareth true repentance? Mat. 26.75 Luk. 7.37.A By the vnfained sorrow for and hatred of euery knowne sin, both in others, and specially in our selues. Perseue∣rance. Phil. 1.6.Q. How know you that you shall perseuere? A.

That he hath chosen me,Ephes. 1.3.4.5. before all beginnings, in Iesus Christ, to be his child: and therefore I am bold to call him Father. Q. What beleeue you concerning Iesus Christ? A. That he is my gratious Lord:1. Cor. 6.20. because by his death I am freed from death and sinne: and by his obedience, I haue righteousnesse and life. Q. What else?

What else? A. That it is he alone, who wor∣keth all spirituall graces in mee, and that maketh all good meanes profi∣table vnto me. Q. What beleeue you concerning the Church? Gen. 4.3.26. Rom. 11.14.A. That there is, and hath bin from the beginning a number, whom the Father hath chosen, and the Sonne redeemed, and whom the holy Ghost doth sanctifie, and glorifie for euer. Q. What else? Act. 24.25. 2. Cor. 5.A. That I being one of the num∣ber, enioy the forgiuenesse of my sins, in this life; and that in the end of the

Rehearse the Commandements. Law shew∣ing mans miserie, and the rule of his life.A. I Am the Lord thy God, which haue brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. 1 Thou shalt haue none other Gods but me. 2 Thou shalt not make to thy selfe any grauen image, nor the likenes of any thing, that is in heauen aboue, or in the earth beneath, or in the water vnder the earth: Thou shalt not bow downe to them, nor worship them: For I the Lord thy God am a iealous God, and visit the sins of the fathers, vpon the children, vnto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me; and shew mercie vnto thousands in them that loue mee and keepe my Commandements.
3 Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vaine. For the Lord will not hold him guiltlesse, that taketh his name in vaine. 4 Remember that thou kéepe holy the Sabbath day. Six daies shalt thou labour, and do al that thou hast to do: but the seuenth day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt doe no manner of work, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, thy man-seruant, and thy maid-seruant, thy cattell, and thy stranger that is within thy gates.

déeds,Mar. 14.42 Luk. 12.35 &c. Redeeming the time. Ephe. 5.25 Col. 4.5. continually; not giuing any li∣berty to wandring thoughts & lusts. 2 Be wise and carefull to redéeme the time which hath been wickedlie, idely, or vnprofitably spent: bestow∣ing no more time in worldly matters, then must needs. Lie downe and arise with God. Psal. 3.5. & 4.8. & 37.5.3 At night lie downe in peace, ha∣uing blessed God for his benefits, and reconciled thy selfe to him for the sins of the day past. In the morning let him haue the first place in thy heart, com∣mitting thy selfe and all thy waies to his gracious gouernement, and conse∣crating them wholly to his glorie. Let prayer go before all businesse. Col. 3.17. Gen. 24.124 Go to no place, frequent no com∣pany, vndertake no busines, study, or trauell whatsoeuer, without heartie prayer to God, in the name of Iesus Christ, for the obtaining of his holy Spirit and mercifull protection. Let prayer be ioyned vvith all blessing. 1. Tim. 4.4.5. Mat. 14.195 In like maner forget not to per∣forme this holy duty, when thou recei∣uest any mercy from God: whether it be food, apparell, recreation, or any o∣ther thing, tending to the health of thy body, or comfort of thy soule: nei∣ther
be so bold, as to deale with any of the creatures of God, till thou hast praied and praised the Creator therof. 6 As praier must go before,Let prayer follow the fruition of all Gods be∣nefits. Mat. 26.33 and ac∣companie al the blessings of God, so it must follow the fruition of them. And therefore, herein let euery Christian set before him the example of Christ and his Apostles, who after they had receiued their bodily & spirituall food, and enioyed the company one of ano∣ther, gaue thanks to God the Father. 7 And though prayer be a spiritu∣all thing,In praying vse the tongue and voice. Psal. 16.9. & 30 12. & 3.4. and consist chiefely in the at∣tention and earnestnes of the minde: yet, for the better quickening of the heart and affections, let the tongue and voice be vsed as oft as conueni∣ently thou maist, lest dulnesse and coldnesse creepe vpon thée. 8 If your calling and estate will possiblie beare it,Set aside some time for godly exercises. Gen. .63 Dan. 5.10. Acts 12 9. let some time of the day be set apart for priuat prayer, me∣ditation, and reading of the scripture, or some other choice booke, that may best further you in the knowledge and practise of true godlinesse.
Things to be thought vpon. Iere. 12.1.2.3. Abac. 1.3. Mat. 25.31 &c.9 Bend your mind to thinke often and earnestly vpon the workes of God: as his creating, and gouerning the world, prospering or punishing the wicked, blessing or correcting his children in this life, with the eternall torment appointed for the one, and the vnspeakeable glory laid vp for the other. The worke of our re∣demption a speciall vvorke. 1. Cor. 2.6.7.8.9. 1. Pet. 1.12.10 But, aboue all the workes of God, thinke vpon the glorious and gratious worke of thy redemption by Iesus Christ; a mysterie that the holy Angels doe admire, and desire to prie into: herein behold the swéet harmo∣nie and happie coniunction of the infi∣nit mercy and iustice of God méeting together; and take comfort and de∣light herein, with thankesgiuing. The liues and deaths of other, but especially of thy selfe, must be thought vpon. Heb. 12.1.2 Ioh. 21.25.11 Marke the life and behauiour of the wicked, to auoid their steps; and of the godly, to prouoke thy selfe to a holy emulation of the like course: marke also their death with like dili∣gence, and think seriously vpon thine owne death, how thou must shortly lie downe in the dust, and part with
whatsoeuer delight thou doest héere enioy; that this may bréed in thée a contempt of the world, and a longing after the life to come. 12 Obserue daily how sinne dieth,1. The. 5.22 Reu. 2.4. Our coue∣nant made with God must be re∣newed. and is weakned in thee, and be care∣full to shun one sinne, as well as ano∣ther: and lose not thy first loue (as the most part doe) and delight in the word and worship of God, and in the fellow∣ship of his Saints; but mourne and striue against thy sinnes, renew thy couenant with God, for that end. 13 When you be in company,Nehe. 9.38 In company bevvare of breaking the third and ninth commande∣ment. haue a care to receiue and doe good, and not hurt, either by your speech or silence, countenance or example: and auoid, as rocks, those common sins against the third and ninth Commandement. Let not God, or any word or work of his be mentioned but with feare, or a∣ny man named but with loue and due regard of that royall law, Whatsoe∣euer ye would, &c. 14 Among all other things séeke to approue thy selfe to God,Mens wal∣king in their parti∣cular cal∣lings, the touchstone of religion. Mat. 23.25 26.27.28. Ierem. 7.9.10.11. Ephe. 5.35 & 6.5.6.7.8.9. his chil∣dren, and thine owne conscience, tou∣ching
thy charge and behauiour in that particular place & calling where∣in God hath set thée, and towards those persons with whom God hath ioyned thee: as, if thou be a seruant, in obeying thy master, seruing him with feare and singlenes of heart: if a ma∣ster, in guiding thy familie according to the word: if a husband, in louing thy wife without bitternes: if a wife, in reuerencing thy husband. Take heede of perfor∣ming holy duties for fashion sake. Heb. 3.12. Esa. 1.11.14 Mat. 15.8. Reu. 3.15.15 Finally, because the corrupt na∣ture of man is so prone to prophane∣nesse and hypocrisie, that when men are once come so far as to vse the out∣ward exercises of religion (without marking in what manner, with what feeling, fruit and profit to their soules they vse the same) they please them∣selues: take heede of this deceit of Sa∣tan, and keepe thy soule with all dili∣gence that these duties be not made matters of course and custome, without care and consci∣ence to grow bet∣ter thereby. FINIS.
