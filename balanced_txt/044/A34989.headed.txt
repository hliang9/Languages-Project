DEare and truely beloved in the everlasting Seed and holy Co∣venant of Life Eternall, doth my soule salute you, with Love unfeigned, for by the same holy pure spi∣rit, by which we have been comforted and refreshed in one another many a time when we have been together, by the same are you brought to my remembrance, and my spirit gives thanks to God dayly on your behalf (to whom I am knit and united by a bond inseparable) because of your preservation in the faith, and pati∣ence of Jesus our Lord, that though the mountains have swelled to a great height, and the waves of the raging Sea hath rowled so violently against the rock of your dwelling; yet you are where you were, and your faith is confirmed through your tribulations, and your patience en∣larged through the experience thereof. Oh deare Lambes! What hath our God done for us? His arme hath been underneath in
all our tryalls, else we must needs have fainted long e're now: But herein doth my soule rejoyce, that your testimony doth live, and that all the strength of dark∣ness hah not sl it, but it remains as a Crowne upon your heads. Oh my dear friends, let no man take away this your Crowne, and let none lose the price he hath already payd, for if any man suffer his testi∣mony to fall, after he hath begun to bear it, he loseth his sufferings that he hath suffered, and 'tis not accounted unto him, but as a reproach, as he that began to build an house, and could not finish it: Therefore, dear hearts, you that have this glorious testimo∣ny of salvation and life committed unto you, be tender and carefull of it, as of your most choice treasure, & count it not a small thing that God hath done for you; for no honour is like unto this honour, nor no free∣dom is like the being a faithfull servant of God; for it hath the reward of this life, and of that which is to come: But alass, my dear friends, none can accomplish this blessed testimony in these dayes of tryall, but those alone, who knows the dayly renewing of
that power, by which we were called unto it; and none feels those renewings, but they that dayly wait upon the Lord, who is the well spring of all our strength and refresh∣ment; and when so ever any comes to slight their watch, and to neglect their wait∣ing upon God, they are but as those that forsake the Fountain, and grows into dry∣ness and barrenness, and becomes unfruit∣full to God, or their own good: Therefore keep your dependence upon the Lord, that ye may abide, (for he abideth) and they that are built upon him alone, do also abide unto the end; for 'tis the unchangeable power which maketh you unchangeable in your testimony; and as you dwell in that, you have the promise, and cannot be brought to naught, as many have been, who have been exalted in the Knowledge, and grown care∣less of the Cross, who are already fallen, and set forth (as Lots Wife once was) as ex∣ampses of the judgement of God: but such as have their depondance upon the Lord alone, fel alwes cause in themselves to be humble, and lowly minded; and although they be joyned to the power of God in the
Covenant of his Light, yet selfe is kept in the death, and the confidence is in the power, and the honour of all is given to that which is eternall, and not to the creature, though never so pure: And they who thus in the true humility gives the honour of their standing and preservation unto the Lord, and not unto themselves, nor their parts, wits, understandings, nor resolutions, these doth God sufficiently honour with his glory and presence, and supports them in all their exercises: But who ever comes to dis∣regard the power, and thinks to stand by what he knows, and hath seen, he stands but in a slippery place. And dear Friends and Brethren, Remem∣ber to keep holy the Sabbath of the Lord our God which is now come, and see that you rest from your labours and toyling your spirits in the earth, and earthly things; and whoever feels a burthen, lay it off, what∣ever it be, that ye may possess all things in the free spirit, that looks not at the vallue of any thing in comparison of the truth, re∣membring the words of the Lord, That where the treasure is, the heart will also be:
So that whose heart is in a Wife, in an Hus∣band, in Children, in Trade, in Riches, in Houses and Lands, or whatever else, so farr that they cannot willingly give them up for the truth, these are such as ones treasure, and this treasure is in the earth, and the heart is there, whatever they profess; and these things comes to be the gods in the se∣cret chambers besides the Lord; and so his first and lasting Commandement (who said) Thou shalt have none other gods besides me, is broken; and this brings guilt and burthens upon the soule, and then thou canst not keep Sabbath to God, for no burthen must be borne thereon, but he that is entred into the rest, is ceased from his labour, as God did from his, and such keeps the holy Sab∣bath. So, dearly beloved, east away that labour and toyle which hath made some to walk uncomfortably in the way, and some to faint and fall from it, and lift up your hearts to God in the faith, and give up your selves, and all things in his will, and there comes an end of all your cares at once, save∣ing onely to be found doing his will in your Generation.
And in this blessed service, is my rejoyce∣ing, and my fellowship with you, and with all the faithfull in Christ Jesus, in whose love my heart is at this time inlarged towards you, beyond what words can utter; yet having no new thing to write unto you, but the very same which we have heard and learnt from the beginning, to wit, that glo∣rious testimony of the Resurrection of Life and of salvation, which God, through the manifestation of his Sonne, hath committed unto us to beare, in which blessed testimo∣ny, I still labour in the strength of the Lord, and he hath blessed me therein, and caused me, by the operation of his divine love, to sound the same Gospel unto severall Coun∣tries and Nations in the Easterne parts of the World, where a door of utterance is opened unto me, and many hath believed, and obeyed the truth; and having now been in England visiting the Churches of Christ about foure Moneths, I am again, in the will of God, about to cross the Seas, though I much desired first to have seen your faces in the Northerne parts, whom my soule deare∣ly loves; but the necessities of other Nati∣ons
and Countries, brings a constraint up∣on me at this time to omit it; but the sa∣lutation of my love abounds towards you, and I pray God give you a liveing sence thereof in your selves, to the comforting and refreshing of every faithfull one a∣mongst you. Farewell, and the God of Peace multiply and increase his goodness in all your soules, and preserve you alive to himself, to beare his holy testimony amongst his enemies, that the World may know that he is risen that saves and preserves from falling, to whom belongs everlasting honour, everlasting renowne and dominion for ever, and evermore. Essex this 15th. of the first Moneth, 1670. Your deare Friend and Brother in the Truth, and Companion in the King∣dome, patience, and tribulations of Jesus. S. C.
