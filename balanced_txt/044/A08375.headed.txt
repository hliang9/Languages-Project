ESOPS EABLES Translated Grammatically, and also in propriety of our English phrase; and, euery way, in such sort as may bee most profitable for the Grammar∣schoole. The vse of it is according to the directions in the prefaces, and more fully set downe in Ludus Lit▪ or the Grammar-schoole. LONDON. Printed by H. L. for Thomas Man. 1617.
To the Right Wor∣shipfull, Sir Iohn Harper, Knight, all true prosperity. RIght worshipfull, I may not bee forget∣ful of the loue which you haue shewed to∣wardes the furthe∣rance of my indeuours, for the Grammar-schoole. Accept ther∣fore this small pledge of my thankefull acknowledgement. Though it be little in valew and in the esteem of the most, yet the bnefit of it will (I trust) help to make amends, and further the perfecting of my desires. By the right vse heereof, may the little ones from their first yeares get much profitable vnderstanding &
wisdome, yea such, as whereof they may haue worthie vse, all their dayes, in what place soe∣uer they shall be imployed; And may moreouer haue euery point & part of the learning in it, so im∣printed in their memories as they shall neuer forget them, but haue them, as it were liuely before their faces: That so they may learne to embrace the vertues therein taught and to flee the vi∣ces, to foresee dangers and how to auoid them, to behaue them∣selues wisely and discreetly in the whole course of their life. As for example, to giue a taste hereof; in the first fable of the cock estee∣ming a barley corne aboue a precious stone, to see the foolish∣of men, especially of children preferring play before learning, a little pleasure and folly, before the most exellent and diuine wis∣dome:
to teach them to fol∣lowe after and to embrace lear∣ning and wisedome, euen from their tender yeares, and to be a∣shamed of misspending their pre∣cious time in play and idle vani∣ties. So in the second fable of the wolfe and the lambe, to teach them to take heede all their life long how they haue to deale with or any way prouoke cruell men, that are too hard for them: Be∣cause they, when they list, can take any occasion to prey vpon them, or to doe them a mischiefe, and that this is matter enough, If they bee not able to resist them. Thus likewise in the third fable of the mouse and the frog, being at war together, about the regi∣ment of the marish ground, vn∣till the kite snatch them both a∣way and deuoure them, to teach children in all their time to be∣ware
of discord and dissension with others, especially contenti∣on for superiority & preferment: Because such vsually as will goe to ware, as it were, for euery tri∣fle, make themselues a prey to o∣thers, especially to the common aduersary. And but onely to name the fourth, In the Apo∣logue of the dogge swimming o∣uer the riuer, which through o∣uer much greediness, chopping at the shadowe of the flesh which he sawe in the water, lost the flesh it selfe which hee carried in his chops, to teach children alwaies to take heed of too much gree∣dinesse, and euer to keep a mea∣sure in their desies, lest that by ouer much earnestnesse in seeking more than is fite, they come to lose all & to repent when it is too late. Now beside this sound wisedome, and besides all the o∣ther
helps concerning the more certaine, easie, and speedy means of attaining the Latine tongue (as happy experience hath taught very many, who haue giuen plen∣tifull testimony hereunto; for construing, pasing, making La∣tine, getting phrase and the like, by such translations) they may learne hereby chiefly to make re∣port of a fable, or of any like nar∣ration, or history in good sort & fit wordes, which is no small commendation to any who∣soeuer. For the manner of effec∣ting hereof, I haue set it downe shortly in the Epistle to the Rea∣der, and more fully in my Gram∣mar-schoole. And thus (that you may see my constant desire in creeping forwarde by little and little, for perfoming my pro∣mise, in accomplishing my ser∣uice for the perpetuall benefit of
schools & of all posterity, by lear∣ning still of all the learned to help the vnlearned, & by propounding to all what I haue found by expe∣rience, that they may find the like and be partakers of al my trauels) haue I presumed vpon your loue to present this little translation vnto you. Which you accepting accordingly I shal be more incou∣raged to striue forward for per∣fecting of the whole, and to spend my last thoughts for the commō good. And thus with all thanke∣full acknowledgement vnto your self with your worthy Lady and all yours I humbly take my leaue, and rest Your Worships in the Lord, I. Brinsley.
To the painefull Schoole∣master. FIrst, cause your scholar, by reading this translation, to tell you in euery fable what the matter of the fable is. Secondly, to what ende and purpose it was inuented, what it is to teach, and what wisedome hee can learne out of it. Thirdly, how to make a good report of the fable, both in English and Latine, especially in English. Fourthly and last∣ly, to make right vse of it, for all mat∣ters concerning Grammar, as for con∣struing, parsing, making and proouing the Latine; and so for reading forth of English into Latine, according to the directions in my former translations, as namely▪ in Sententiae▪ Cao, Cord. &c. And principally for obseruing the best phrases both English and Latine; thus shall you receiue your desire. Those things which are too harsh to be vttered in English, word for word, according to
the Latine phrase, I haue referred to the margent, with an Asteriske or little Star: and variety of English phrase, I haue set also in the margent, noted with a little r. But for these I referre you to that which I haue written in my for∣mer translations, and in my Grammar∣schole. Vouchsafe mee your better de∣rection, in loue; and what is defectiue, I shall (God willing) labour to supply in the next edition.

That hee neither could in∣deed marre the drinke of the wolfe, sith hee dranke farre beneath, nor yet to haue been willing. would. The wolfe on the other side. contrarily spea∣keth vehemetly or railes against the lambe. thunde∣reth: [saying,] Thou wretch church robber, this is nothing thou sayst. thou doest nothing: thou alwaies hur∣test [me] alwayes. hurtest [mee:] [thy] father, mother, all thy ened. odious stocke or kinred. kinde is against me diligently or alwayes. by all meanes.

Therefore being astonied. sore smitten with the losse both of the flesh. thing and also of his hope, first, hee was astonished. a∣mazed, and then receiuing againe courge. afterwardes getting heart againe, hee barked out. howled out thus: O wretch a measure was wanting, or thou wast too greedy. there wan∣ted a measure to thy coutousnesse. greedi∣nesse. Thou hadst e∣nough and too much. The was enough, & more than enough, vnlesse thou hadst doated, o but that thou doated. if thou hadst not doated: lesse than nothing is now to thee by thy foolishnesse. now thou hast lesse than nothing by thy foolishnesse. Mor.] Wee are admonished of modesty, or to bee modest. put in minde of modesty by this fable, wee are put in minde of wisedome, that there be a measure to our cotous∣nesse. in our desire; lest wee lose certain things for vncertain. Surely that Teentian Sanio. Sanio in Terence [speaks] sublly, . wittily: I, quoth he, will not buy hope with a price. so deare.
5Vnfaithfull dealing of great men towards their .

A countrie mouse saw this mouse. him, inuiteth [him,] it is prepared. preparation is made, it is gone to sup. they goe to supper. The countrie mouse fetcheth forth whatsoeuer hee had laid vp against winter, and draweth out. brin∣gth out all his victuals, or pro∣uision. store, that hee might fulfill, or fill. satisfie the dainti nesse of so great a guest. neuerthelesse. Yet notwithstanding, the city mouse wrinkling his forehead. frowning, condem∣neth the pouerty. scarsity of the coū∣trey, and afterward. and then praiseth the abundance. plenty of the citie. [And] go∣ing back, he leadeth the coū∣trie mouse with him into the city, that hee might giue proofe and experience of that to him. ap∣prooue in deede, that which hee had bragged of in words.

As Hercules shall help me. In good sooth, your dainties sauour more of gall than of hony. I in truth will rather, or desire. had rather haue my scarsity with securi∣ty, than this abundance with such anxiety, or care, doubtfulnesse, or fearefulnese. feare. Mor.] Riches indeed do beare before themselues [or make a shew of] pleasure. haue in∣deed a shew of pleasure, but if you looke within [them] they haue dangers. perils and bitternesse. There was one Eutrapilus, who when hee would hurt his enemies most of all, made

For as bechance I passe by this way, beholding, or seeing thee. spying you in a tr, I flee vnto thee. come running vnto you, blaming report. fame. For the fame is, thee to be blac∣ker. that you are blac∣ker than pitch, and I see [you] whiter than snow.

I will call you the queene of all the birds. The crowe beeing entiled. allured by this little flattery. pretty flattery, prepares [himselfe] to sing. But the cheese falleth our of [his] beake. bil, to him preparing as hee was preparing [to sing,] which beeing snatched vp, the fox-cub taketh vp a laughter as if he were tickled. Al. and shame be∣ing mixed to the lose of the thing he grieueth. a lowd laughter. Then at length it shames the miserable crow, and rketh him of himselfe, and the losse of the thing beeing mixed with shame it

If you will bee Thraso, Gnato shall neuer be wanting vnto thee, or thou shalt neuer want a Gna∣tho if thou wilt be a Thraso. you shall neuer want a Gnato. 12 Of a lion spent with olde age;The iust reward of cruelty. admonishing vs euer to beware of cruelty, or beeing ouer fierce in prosperity. r render him like recompence. A Lion which had made very many [his] ene∣mies by his cruelty. fierceness in [his] youth, paid punishment paid for it in [his] old age.
