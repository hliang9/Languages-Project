THE PREFACE. Reader, THis small Treatise now put into thy Hand, has no less of Authority and Ʋse, than it has of Antiquity. It con∣tains the Ancient Charter of King Henry the Third, concerning the Or∣dinance of Romney-Marsh, and the Laws and Customs made by the Learned Justice Henry de Bathe, in the Two and fortieth year of the Raign of the said Henry the Third, for the Reparation of the Sea-Banks, and for the preservation of the said Marsh
from Inundations; and is since become the Pattern or Law for all other Sea-Borders, and great Marshes and Fenns. I need not use much Art to recommend to the Ingenu∣ous Reader, the Authority and Ʋsefulness of this Book; It being the Grant of a Wise Prince, and the Law and Ordinance Fra∣med and Contrived by a Learned Sage in the Laws of this Realm, and continues to this day the Standard from whence all Eng∣land receives Light and Direction, as will appear by those following Exam∣ples. The Act of 6 H. 6. cap. 5. in the6 H. 6. cap. 5. very Form of the Commission of Sewers, it is there said, That the Commissioners shall make and ordain necessary and conveni∣ent Statutes and Ordinances for the De∣fence and Safety of the Sea-Banks and Marshes, and the parts adjoyning accor∣ding to the Laws and Customs of ROM∣NEY-MARSH, and to hear and determine according to the Law and Cu∣stom of our Realm of England, and the Custom of ROMNEY-MARSH, all and singular the Premisses, &c. The Famous English Lawyer Sir Edward Cook,4 Inst. cap. 62. fo. 276. in the Fourth Part of his Institutes of the Laws of England, hath these words, ROMNEY-MARSH in the
County of Kent containing 24000 Acres, is at this day, and long time hath been, Governed by certain Aun∣cient and Equal Laws of Sewers, made by the Venerable Justice Henry de Bathe, in the Raign of King HEN∣RY the Third, from which Laws, not only other Parts in Kent, but all ENG∣LAND receive LIGHT AND DIRECTION. For Example, in the General Act of 23 H. 8. cap.23 H. 8. cap. 5. 5. concerning Sewers in Section 3. there is a Clause which giveth pow∣er to the Commissioners to make Sta∣tutes, Ordinances and Provisions, &c. necessary and behoofeful after the Laws and Customs of ROMNEY-MARSH in the County of Kent, or otherwise by any ways and means, &c. The Learned Serjeant Callis in his Read∣ingCallis his Read∣ings. upon the Statute of 23 H. 8. cap. 5. of Sewers, makes very great use of, and frequently quotes the Charter of Romney-Marsh, as the Basis on which that Statute was founded, as you find by perusing that Reading. By all which it will evidently appear, of what Ʋse and Esteem the Law and Customs of Romney-Marsh have been held in, in
time past, by the most Eminent Pro∣sessors of the Law. Nor is it of any less Ʋse and Esteem at this day, as may be seen by the Statute of 15 Car.15 Car. 2. cap. 2. Sect. 5. 2. cap. 2. made for the draining the great Level of the Fenns, called Bedford-Le∣vel, in Section the fifth, where there is a Clause, That the Governors, Bai∣liffs, and Conservators of Bedford-Level, shall have further power (as well for the Maintenance of the said GREAT LEVEL, as for laying and levying of Taxes) to use and exercise within the said Great Le∣vel, such and the like Laws and Customs; and constitute and appoint such and the like Officers, from time to time, as are or lawfully may be used in ROMNEY-MARSH in the County of Kent. Now Read∣er, having given thee the Opinion of the Learned upon this Treatise it self: I shall let the Reader know the Rea∣sons that induced the Publisher to re∣print it: (1.) The General Benefit and Advantage that all may Reap thereby. Secondly, The particular Sollicitation of some Friends, who are Interested in this, or some other Marshes subject to
these Laws and Customs, and having long Endeavoured to purchase this small Tract, could not obtain it under 6 s price, its scarceness and usefulness ha∣ving enhanced its price so far beyond its bulk; for which Reasons the Re∣printing it was deemed of General Ac∣ceptation and Advantage; which that it may so prove, is the Publishers great De∣sign and Aim.

Henric de Bathonia, quod cum ju∣dicia fieri debeant per viginti quatu∣or legales homines de Marisco de Romenal, ad districtiones faciendas super omnes illos, qui terras, & tenementa habent in praedicto Ma∣risco, ad reparandum Wallias & Watergagia ejusdem Marisci, contra Maris impetum & inundationem aliarum aquarum. Et etiam super omnes illos qui ad reparationem prae∣dictarum Walliarum & Watergagiorum a∣lias obligati sunt vol tenentur. Et eisdem viginti quatuor Juratis, Dominus Rex, perChrta H. 3. .

majores & minores, quas homines habent in eodem Marisco, & secundum quod quidam ad hoc obligantur vel tenentur. Ita quod nullus Vicecomes Domini Regis Kanciae, vel aliquis Ballivorum suorum, de districtionibus illis per considerationem prae∣dictorum viginti quatuor Juratorum factis propter periculum praedictum evitandum, in aliquo se intromittant. Sed si quis de consideratione praedictarum districtionumCallis Lect. fol. 155. se injuste gravatum sentiret, & inde con∣queri vellet, ad ipsum Dominum Regem, querelem suam deferret, & ipse ei in Cu∣ria sua Justitiam fieri faceret, & illam Justitiam, ipsi Domino Regi vel Mandato suo speciali specialiter reservasset, iidemJuratores prop∣ter resistentiam hominum Ma∣risci dictas di∣strictiones fa∣cere nequeant. viginti quatuor Juratores, propter consi∣derationem & resistentiam quorundam ho∣minum de praedicto Marisco, qui ad re∣parationem dictarum Walliarum & Water∣gagiorum, secundum quantitatem terra∣rum & tenementorum quae habent in eodem Marisco tenentur, dictas districtiones fa∣cere nequeant, unde Walliae illae & Water∣gagiae irreparatae existunt per quod inunda∣tiones Maris & aliarum aquarum de dictoRex constituit Henricum de Bathonio ad audiend' & ' contentiones in∣ter praedicts . Jurat' & . Marisco magnum occupant spatium, ad ipsius Domini Regis & hominum dicti Marisci inestimabile dispendium. Ipse Do∣minus Rex, dictum Henricum constituit, Justiciarium suum, ad audiendum & ter∣minandum contentiones ortas de repara∣tione praedicta, inter praedictos viginti qua∣tuor
Juratos, & homines praedicti Marisci. Et providendum securitati & defensioni praedicti Marisci, contra Maris & aliarum aquarum inundationem & periculum, per reparationem praedictarum Walliarum & Watergagiorum faciendam, per eos qui ad reparationem illam, secundum quantita∣tem Terrarum & Tenementorum quae ha∣bent in eodem Marisco tenentur, & se∣cundum quod quidam ad hoc, alias obgli∣gantur & tenentur. Mandans eidem Henrico, dictus Dominus Rex, quod ad di∣em & locum quos ad hoc duxerit provi∣dendum esset in partibus illis, ad praedi∣cta faciendum sicut praedictum est: Et quod ipse quid inde fecerit, ipsi Domino Regi in scriptis, distinctè & apertè scire fa∣ceret, ut idem Dominus Rex ea irrotulari fa∣cere posset, &c. Per quod Mandatum, idem Henricus die supradicto, existens apud Romenal as∣sociatis sibi praedicto Nicholao de Handlo, & Aulredo de Dene, & assistente eidem Vicecomite Kanciae, qui per praeceptum Domini Regis ad diem illum, coram illoOrdinatio Hen∣rici de Batho∣nia Justiciarij Domini Regis H. 3. venire fecit, tot & tales probos & lega∣les homines de Balliva sua, per quod di∣ctae contentiones terminari, & dicta pro∣visio melior fieri possunt, nullo homine de praedicto Marisco tunc contradicente; dictus HENRICUS communitatis praedicti Marisci similiter ibidem tunc ex∣istentis, interveniente Consilio ordinavit in
forma subscripta: videlicet, quod per to∣tamQuod 12. ho∣mines Eligantur per totam Com∣munitatem, viz. 6. de Food' Ar∣chiepiscopi, et 6. de Baronia qui mensurabunt Wallias et Ter∣ras quae infra¦dictum Maris∣cum periculo subjacent. Callis Lect. fol. 158. communitatem dicti Marisci eligantur duodecim legales homines, videlicet, sex de feodo Archiepiscopi Cantuariensis, & sex de Baronia qui jurati mensurabunt Wallias novas & antiquas, & illas qui de novo construi oporteat. Et debet fieri ea∣dem mensuratio per unam & eandem per∣ticam, scilicet, viginti pedum. Et postea praedicti Jurati per eorum Sacramentum similiter per eandem perticam mensura∣bunt, per Acras omnes Terras & Tene∣menta quae infra dictum Mariscum peri∣culo subjacent. Quibus mensurationibus factis, viginti quatuor per communicatem prius electi & jurati, habito respectu ad quantitatem Walliarum, Terrarum & Te∣nementorum, quae periculo subjacent, per eorum Sacramentum ordinabunt, quan∣tum ad praedictarum Walliarum sustenta∣tionem & reparationem faciendam & su∣stinendam, ad quemlibet pertineat: Ita quod pro portione Acrarum TerrarumJarat' proporti∣one Acrarum Terrarum peri∣culo singulis as∣signetur sua portio pertica∣rum per loca certa. periculo subjacentium singulis assignetur sua portio perticarum, & praedicta assignatio fiat per loca certa. Ita ut sci∣atur ubi & per quae loca, ad quantum singuli defendere teneantur. Et cum ne∣cessitas evenerit cujus occasione opor∣teat periculo & impetu Maris obviare vel resistere per reparationem Wallia∣rum praedictarum, convenire debent vi∣ginti quatuor Jurati, ad videndum per quae loca praedicta emineat necessitas, &

praedicta Carta continetur; Quae quidem Carta ista non obstante Ordinatione in suo perpetuo robore perseveret, &c. Rex Vicecomiti Kanciae Salutem. Cum nuper assignaverimus dilectum & fide∣lem Domini Regis vicecomi∣te Kanciae quod de distructioni∣bus praedictis in nullo se intro∣tat. nostrum Henricum de Bathonia ad au∣diendum & terminandum contentiones habitas inter 24. legales homines de Ma∣risco de Romenal, per quorum conside∣rationem reparationes Walliarum & Wa∣tergagiorum ejusdem Marisci contra Ma∣ris impetum, & periculum aliarum a∣quarum ibidem inundantium fieri de∣bent, & alias Terras & Tenementa in eodem Marisco habentes, qui Wallias & Watergagias illas reparare debent & solebant. Et idem Henricus ad partes illas personaliter decedens, ordinaverit quod secundum considerationem praedi∣ctorum viginti quatuor Juratorum distri∣ctiones fierent pro reparatione Walliarum & Watergagiorum praedictarum. Ita quod nullus Vicecomes aut alius Ballivus noster se intromittent de districtionibus prae∣dictis, sicut in Rotulis Cancellariae no∣strae, ordinationem illam exprimentibus continetur. Tu nichilominus districtio∣nes illas propter hoc factum, per vi∣ginti quatuor Juratores in praejudicium considerationis eorundem relaxasti. Et quia si quis se gravatum sentiat, ex consideratione praedicta pro qua conqueri voluerit, ad nos venire debet remedium peti∣turus. Tibi praecipimus, quod de districtio∣nibus
praedictis in nullo te intromittas, sed eas viginti quatuor Juratoribus & eorum Ballivo ad hoc deputato, distri∣ctiones illas returnari facias. Ne itera∣tus clamor ad nos inde perveniat, pro quo ad te graviter capere debeamus. Teste meipso apud Westmonasterium vice∣simo die Aprilis, Anno Regni nostri quadragesimo tertio, per Henricum de Batho∣nia, &c. Tunc sequitur numerus omnium Acra∣rum infra dictum Mariscum sicut reperitur per mensuram factam, Anno Regni Regis Henrici quadragesimo secundo, & etiam agistatio tam in Magna Wallia de Apuldre, quam in parva Wallia, ad quantitatem Ter∣rarum Tenementum infra, &c.

Unde dicit quod deterioratus est, & damnum habet ad valenciam, &c. Et

Hamo & alii venerunt & defenderunt, &c. & quicquid quod est contra Pacem, &c. quando, &c. & bene cognoscunt quod ipsi caeperunt decem vaccas prae∣dictas, &c. ipsius Godefridae juste & in Pace Domini Regis, quia dicit quod praedictus Godefridus habet Terras, &c. in Marisco de Romeney ubi omnes tenentes Terras & Tenementa in eodem Maris∣co secundum quantitatem Terrae suae debent facere Wallias & Waterga∣gias contra Mare, propter inundationes Aquarum, ac viginti quatuor homines le∣gales de dicto Marisco electi per commu∣nitatem dicti Marisci, & Juratores super Tenentes in eodem Marisco facere debent districtiones, secundum quantitatem tene∣mentorum suorum cum necesse fuerit, ad praedictas Wallias & Watergagias facien∣dum & reparandum. Qui quidem Jurati in eodem Marisco, prout moris est, eo quod omnes ad hoc vacare non potuere, elege∣runt praedictum Hamonem, ad faciendum praedictas districtiones, & ipsum fecerunt Ballivum suum ad hoc faciendum, & istam libertatem habent per antiquam consuetudinem ejusdem Marisci, & per cartam Domini Regis quam nunc pro∣ferunt in hec verba. Henricus Dei gra∣tia, &c. Unde dicit, quod ratione de∣fectus ipsius Godefridi, juste fecit super ipsum praedictam districtionem ad praedi∣ctas Wallias & Watergagias reparandas,
de quibus in Wallia de Apuldre ei assig∣natae sunt ad portionem suam, per prae∣dictos Juratos, tres perticatae & dimidium ad minus ad Custum suum reparan∣dum, & secundum inundationem. Aqua∣rum plus, si necesse fuerit per loca di∣versa, & quod super ipsum majorem districtionem nisi fecerint ponunt se super Patriam, &c. Dicunt tamen, quod ceperunt super quendam A. B. sex Boviculos, qui fuit firmatius ipsi∣us Godefridi, & decem Agnos super I. N. Tenentes ipsius Godefridi, ratione de∣fectuum praedictarum Walliarum & Wa∣tergagiarum, propter quod post modum ipsi satisfecerunt & rehabuerunt averia sua. Quaesitis pro quanto fecit primam districtionem & pro quanto secundam di∣cunt quod primus defectus ipsius Godefri∣di estimabatur ad quatuor Marcas, & se∣cundus defectus ad quadraginta octo Soli∣dos. Et praedictus Godefridus dicit, quodReplicatio . ipse Tenet Tenementa sua in Marisco praedicto, ex dono & concessione Do∣mini Henrici quondam Regis Angliae, avi Domini Regis Henrici nunc, quae idem Dominus Henricus ded't cuidam Willielmo filio Balderi Antecessori ipsius Godefridi, cujus haeres, &c. per quam con∣cessionem antecessores sui, & ipse postea sempertenuit Tenementa sua in praedicto ma∣risco, adeo liberè & quietè sicut praedictus Balderus ea prius tenuit. Et bene dicunt quod nec ab Antecessoribus suis, nec ab ipso
nunquam fuit quaesita hujusmodi consu∣etudo, ad dictas Wallias & Watergagi∣as reparandas, nisi jam quintis Annis elapsis, postquam praedictus Hamo factus fuit Ballivus, ad praedictas Wallias & Watergagias custodiendas, nec unquam aliquo tempore ea fecerunt. Et profert cartam ipsius Henrici Regis in hec ver∣ba. Henricus Dei Gratia Rex Angliae, &c. Archiepiscopo Cantuariensis, &c. Et dicit quod praedictum Feoffamentum te∣nuere Antecessores sui, praedicta Te∣nementa adeo libere, quod nunquam fece∣runt nec reparaverunt Wallias nec Water∣gagias nec ipse, postquam Terras illas tenuit, nec antecessores sui districti fu∣erunt, quousque jam quinque Annis elap∣sis vel sex, quod praedictus Hamo & alii ceperunt averia sua. Et desicut ipsi cognoscunt quod fecerunt super ipsum, praedictam districtionem pro defectu repara∣tionis praedictarum Walliarum & Waterga∣giarum, quas nec ipse nec Antecessores sui, fecerunt nec unquam facere consueve∣runt, petit judicium de eorum recogniti∣one. Et praedictus Hamo & alii dicunt,Rejungen' Defendentum. quod aliquo tempore fuit contentio in∣ter Tenentes in praedicto marisco su∣per reparatione praedictarum Walliarum & Watergagiarum, ita quod placitum motum fuit inde in Comitatu coram Vicecomite, propter quod viginti qua∣tuor Jurati sentientes se gravatos vene∣runt ad Curiam Domini Regis & conquesti
fuerunt de Vicecomite asserentes, quod hujusmodi placitùm non pertinuit ad Vicecomitem tenendum, ita quod per Consilium Domini Regis provisum fuit, quod ibidem mitterentur Justiciarii Do∣mini Regis, ad ordinandum & dispo∣nendum quod justum esset de hujus con∣tentionibus.Ordinatio Hen∣rici de Bathonia placitata. Ita quod Henricus de Batho∣nia ibidem missus fuit, & omnes Te∣nentes dicti Marisci habuerunt Summo∣nitionem quadraginta dierum sicut fuis∣set in itinere Justiciarioriis. Et ipse Prae∣dictus Henricus, visis praedictis Walliis & Watergagiis, per assensum & volun∣tatem totius communitatis praedicti Ma∣risci ordinant, quod Archiepiscopi, Epis∣copi, Abbates, Priores, Comites, Baro∣nes, & omnes Tenentes in eodem Ma∣risco contribuerunt, secundum quantita∣tem Tenementi sui, ad praedictas Wal∣lias & Watergagias reficiendas, unde sicut praedictus Godfridus vult defendi per praedictas Wallias & Watergagias, petit quod contribuat ad easdem repa∣randas sicut coram praedicto Justiciario fuit ordinatum. Et quod talis sit or∣dinatio, sicut praedictum, ponit se su∣per Recordum Rorulorum praedicti Hen∣rici de Bathonia. Dicit etiam quod ne∣cesse est quod ipse contribuat ad praedictas Wallias, &c. quia dicit quod nisi Terra sua per praedictas Wallias esset defensa, tota Terra sua esset superundata & falsata. Et prae∣dictus Godfridus dicit quod licet praedicta
Ordinatio facta fuisset per praedictumSurrejungen' quer'. Quod ille nun∣quam eidem Ordinationi Consentit nec Summonitus fu∣it. Def' respond' quod ipse quer habuit Commu∣nem Summoni∣tionem sicut re∣liqui Marisci habuerunt. Henricum ipse Godefridus nunquam eidem Ordinationi consensit, nec summonitus fuit, nec vocatus venire coram ipso ad ipsam Ordinationem faciendam; dicit e∣tiam quod nec ante ipsam Ordinatio∣nem nec post, ipse nec Antecessores e∣jus, nuper fecerunt hujusmodi contribu∣tionem, sed semper tenuerunt Terram suam quietam ab omnimoda exactione, se∣cundum Tenorem praedictae Cartae Henrici Regis avi Regis nunc, quousque jam duo∣bus Annis elapsis, praedicti Hamo & alii ceperunt averia sua, unde petit judici∣um si praedictus debeat ei nocere in hac parte. Et praedicti Hamo & alii dicunt quod ipse habuit Communem Summonitio∣nem quadraginta dierum, sicut tota Com∣munitas praedicti Marisci, quam ipse ig∣norare non debuit, unde dicit quod li∣cet ibidem nollet venire, sicut debet cum vicinis suis, non debet esse quietus prop∣ter hoc à praedicta Contributione, ad praedictas Wallias reparandas, desicut communis utilitas est omnium Tenenti∣um in dicto Marisco, quod tam Terra ip∣sius quam Terra aliorum Tenentium de∣fendatur per praedictas Wallas & Wa∣tergagias, unde petit Judicium, dicit e∣tiam quod post praedictam Ordinationem dederunt praedictus Godfridus & homi∣nes sui unam Marcam ad Wallias & Wa∣tergagias praedictas reparandas, antequam idem Hamo esset Ballivus, & quod ita sit
paratus est verificare, &c. Et Godefri∣dus dicit quod tenet se ad praedictam Cartam Domini Regis & ad libertatem suam quam ipse & antecessores sui usi sunt, contra quas nulla ordinatio per praedictum Henricum facta, potest nec debet ei nocere, & bene defendit, quod nec ipse nec aliquis per ipsum, aliquid unquam ante praedictam Ordi∣nationem, nec post ad dictam repara∣tionemExit. dedit. Et hoc paratus est verifi∣care, &c. Postea in crastino sancti Mar∣tini, anno quadragesimo secundo, venerunt praedicti G. H. & alii, &c. Et praeceptumVen. fac. agard'. est Vicecomiti quod venire faciat, a die Pasche in Tres Septimanas ubicunque, duodecim tam milites quam, &c. per quos, &c. Et qui nec, &c. nec habent terras in praedicto Marisco ad receptum, &c. si praedictus Godefridus & antecessores sui, post∣quam habuerunt terram suam de Hurst, de dono & concessione Domini Henrici Regis Angliae, simul cum aliis homini∣bus habentibus Terram in dicto Maris∣co consueverunt reparare Wallias & Water∣gagias & contribuere cum praedictis homi∣nibus ad eas reparandum, cum necesse fuerit, unde ipse Godefridus per quan∣dam ordinationem, in quam ipse con∣cessit coram Henrico de Bathonia, quem dominus Rex ad hoc misit faciendum, dedit unam marcam ad dictas Wallias & Watergagias reparandas, antequam prae∣dictus Hamo fuisset Ballivus praedicti
Marisci, sicut praedictus H. & I. dicunt, vel si praedictus Godefridus vel antecesso∣res sui quieti fuerunt, de hujusmodi reparationibus, Williarum & Waterga∣giarum, & praestationibus ad eandem per Cartam praedicti Henrici Regis avi, &c. ita quod praedictus Godefridus non consensit praedictae ordinationi, nec ali∣quid unquam dedit ad praedictas Wal∣lias & Watergagias reparandas sicut prae∣dictus Godefridus dicit. Quia tam, &c. postea a die Paschae in tres septimanas Anno quadragesimo secundo, Viceco∣mes non misit breve suum, Ideo ipse in misericordia, &c. scilicet Fulco Peyforer, Ideo sicut prius, praeceptum est Vicecomiti quod venire faciat, hic a die sanctae Tri∣nitatis, in quindecim dies ubicunque, &c. duodecim, &c. per quos, &c. Et qui nec, &c. Postea ad diem illum venerunt prae∣dictus Godfridus H. & alii & petierunt sibi judicium fieri secundum recordum & processum loquelae praedictae, & re∣citata fuit loquela coram Domino Rege & consilio suo. Et quia compertum est secundum recordum illud, quod Domi∣nus Rex alias misit Henricum de Bathonia Justiciarium suum ad hoc assignatum, ad praedictum Mariscum de Romenal qui disposuit quod omnes illi qui Terras & tenementa in praedicto Marisco habe∣rent contributionem facerent, secundum quantitatem tenementorum, ad Wallias & Watergagias praedicti Marisci reparandum
sicut praedicti Hamo & alii dicunt, ad quam contributionem praedictus Godefridus non obligatur, sicut praedictus Godefridus di∣cit, nec adhuc constat Curiae Regis hic de praedictis ordinatione & dispositi∣one, sine quibus rite ad Judicium proce∣di non potest. Data est eis dies a die Sancti Michaelis in quindecim dies, ubi∣cunque, &c. Et interim scrutantur ro∣tuli de tempore praedicti Henrici de Ba∣thonia. Et sciendum est quod inhibi∣tum est dicto Hamoni ne pendente eodem placito distringat praedictum Godefridum. Postea a die Sancti Michaelis in quindecim dies, anno, &c. Quadragesimo tertio, venit praedictus Godefridus & subtraxit seQuer' subtraxit se de Brevi suo, Et ideo ipse in Misericordia. de Brevi suo versus praefatos Hamonem & alios, &c. & ideo ipse in misericordia, &c. Et insuper concessit pro se & hae∣redibus suis, quod de caetero reparari fa∣cient vel faciet Wallias & Watergagias pro portione quantitatis Terrae suae, una cum vicinis suis, prout consuetudo pa∣triae est, sine contradictione seu cavilla∣tione imperpetuum. Et praedictus HamoCalli. Lect 150. concessit & obligavit pro se & aliis, quod computabit coram viginti quatu∣or Juratoribus electis de patria super di∣strictionibus & averiis captis, praedicti Godefridi, pro praedictis Walliis & Wa∣tergagiis reparandis, ab initio istius pla∣citi, usque nunc, &c. Et districtiones illae, secundum quantitatem portionis sibi con∣tingentis, interim pro praedictis Walliis

Et idem Godefridus concessit, quod si praedictus Hamo non computando possit ve∣rificare, quod averia nomine districtionis per ipsum capta occasione praemissa, valorem eorundem non suffcere pro portione quan∣titatis Terrae suae, ad praedictas Willias & Wa∣tergagias reparandas, quod idem Godefri∣dus fatisfaciet el in omnibus arreragiis, ab initio ejusdem placiti, usque nunc per visum & estimationem praedictorum viginti quatu∣or Juratorum de patria, &c.

Dominus Rex mandavit dilectis & fideli∣bus suis, Johannis de Lovetot, & Henrico de Apuldrefeld, breve suum, in haec verba, Edwardus Dei gratia Rex Angliae, Dominus Hiberniae, & Dux Aquitaniae, dilectis & fide∣libus suis, Johanni de Lovetot, & Henrico de Apuldrefeld salutem. Sciatis quod cum nos
ratione dignitatis regiae, & per Juramen∣tum abstricti sumus, ad providendum sal∣vationi regni nostri, circumquaque assigna∣vimus, vos ad supervidendum Wallias & fossata per costeram maris & partium adja∣centium in comitatu Kanciae, per maris intemperiem diversimode diruta, ad in∣quirendum per quorum defecta hujus damnum contigit ibidem, & de omni∣bus illis qui Terras & Tenementa te∣nent in partibus illis, & defensionem & salvationem habent qualitercunque, vel habere possunt per hujus Wallias & fossatas, & ad eos pro quantitate terrae & tenementorum suorum, sive per nu∣merum Acrarum terrae, sive per caru∣catas pro rata portione tenurae suae di∣stringendi una cum Ballivis libertatum & aliorum de partibus illis ad ea in lo∣cis necessariis reparandum, quotiens & ubi necesse fuerit, ita quod aliqui tenen∣tes Terras seu Tenementa hujus vel alteri∣us fuerit conditionis, status seu dignitatis, qui qualitercunque defensionem habeant per hujus Wallias & fossatas, sive fu∣erit infra libertatem, sive extra nulla∣tenus parcatur in hac parte. Et ideo vobis Mandamus quod in executionem istius negotii, ita fideliter & discrete vos habeatis, quod tam homines ma∣nentes in locis praedictis, quam Terrae eorun∣dem salventur contra similia pericula, & ca∣sualiter pejora nulla consimiliter favorabili∣ter introducte resistente. Et vos super hiis
quae in hac parte feceritis & ordinave∣ritis, sub vestris sigillis & sigillis Jura∣torum tam militum, quam aliorum pro∣borum & legalium hominum, distincte & aperte reddetis certiores. Mandavi∣mus enim Vicecomiti nostro comitatus praedicti, quod ad certos dies & loca quos eis scire faceret, coram vobis venire faceret tot & tales probos & legales ho∣mines de Balliva sua, per quos rei veritas melius sciri poterit & inquiri in praemis∣sis, &c. In cujus rei testimonium, &c. Teste Edmundo Comite Cornubiae Constabula∣rio nostro, apud Westmonasterium quinto decimo die Novembris, anno regni nostro sextodecimo. Per quod quidem mandatum, praeceptum fuit Vicecomiti quod venire faceret co∣ram praefatis Justiciariis hic ad hunc di∣em,Mandatum vicecomiti. viginti quatuor Juratores de Marisco de Romenal, & omnes Dominos Wallia∣rum ejusdem Marisci, & tot & tales pro∣bos & legales homines de singulis terris Maritimis in Balliva sua, per quos rei ve∣ritas in praemissis, melius sciri poterit & inquiri, ad faciendum ulterius id quod in praemissis fuerit ordinandum, qui modo venerunt. Et praedicti viginti quatuor Juratores de Marisco praedicto una cum com∣munitate ejusdem Marisci dixerunt, quodJuratores placi∣tant Cartam H. 8. eisdem con∣cessm. Dominus Henricus Rex pater Regis nunc per Cartam suam concessit eis quasdam liberta∣tes in terris suis de Marisco praedicto & pe∣tierunt
quod libertates suae praedictae sibi salventur, & quod nihil attemptetur vel ordinetur in praejudicium libertatum sua∣rum praedictarum. Et profert Cartam Do∣mini Henrici praedicti in haec verba. Hen∣ricus Dei Gratia, &c. Dixerunt etiam quod Dominus Rex pater Domini Regis nunc Anno regni sui quinquagesimo se∣cundo ratione cujusdam dissentionis sub∣ortae inter diversos homines Marisci su∣pradicti occasione Williarum & Water∣gagiorumPlacitant eti∣am Ordinatio∣nem Henrici de Bathonia praed. ibidem reparandorum misit Hen∣ricum de Bathonia Justiciarium suum ad partes illas, ad audiendum & terminan∣dum contentiones ortas de reparatione praedicta inter viginti quatuor Juratores & homines praedicti Marisci & ad pro∣videndum securitati & defensioni ejus∣dem Marisci, contra Maris & aliarum aquarum inundationem & periculum per reparationem praedictarum Walliarum & Watergagiarum faciendam per eos qui per reparationem illam secundum quanitatem Terrarum & Tenemento∣rum suorum quae habent in eodem Marisco tenentur. Unde dicunt quod praefatus Henricus de Bathonia Aucto∣ritate mandati Domini HENRI∣CI Regis praedicti ordinavit & statuit eis ibidem certam Legem & Ordinati∣onem per quas Mariscus ille hucusque cu∣stoditur & salvatur, unde petierunt quod per ordinationem & Legem illam possint im∣posterum deduci & defendi sicut hactenus
consueverunt. Et super hoc protulerunt prae∣dictam ordinationem ipsius Henrici de Ba∣thonia sub Sigillo Domini Regis in haec ver∣ba Coram Henrico de Bathonia, &c. ut su∣pra, &c. Et quia ordinatio praedicti Henrici sta∣timConfirmatio Ordinationis Henrici de Ba∣thonia. videtur concordans equitati & hucus{que} fuit approbata, praeceptum est & statu∣tum quod ordinatio illa in omnibus ob∣servetur absque diminutione: additio ta∣men quod quia in ordinatione praedicta nihil fuit expressum de electione commu∣nis Ballivi Domini Regis in Marisco prae∣dicto,Ad quam mo∣dus Eligendi Communis Bal∣livi additur. quomodo est per quos electio illa fieri debeat, concordatum est, quod de caetero cedente vel decedente communi Ballivo praedicti Marisci locus ipsius alius eligatur, qui resideat et terras habeat in praedicto Marisco. Et fiat electio illa de caetero per communem assensum duarum villarum ejusdem Marisci, vel per Attorna∣tos suos, & ubi major pars numero con∣censerit, stabitur eorum electioni, quia sic hactenus ibi fieri consuevit. De duplo est sumptuum appositorum de reparati∣one defectuum praedicti Marisci le∣vand. in poenam negligentium defectus ipsos contingentes reparare concorda∣tum est, quod duplum illud levetur sicutQuomodo du∣plum levetur & approprietur. priori ordinatione fuerat statutum, & quod duplum illud in communem utilitatem reparationis dicti Marisci revertatur & ad usus Ballivi ejusdem Marisci de cae∣tero
non observetur. Et quia in prae∣dicto Marisco diversae Walliae & Water∣giae quarum reparationem & sustenta∣tionem communitas ejusdem Marisci non contribuit, nisi tantum illi qui di∣ctis Walliis & Watergagiis Terras habent continguas & proximas, & quidam per op∣pressiones Dominorum dicti Marisci quan∣doque tantum solverint, ad reparatio∣nem & sustentationem earundem pro quadraginta Acris quantum, alii pro quin∣quaginta Acris quod magis fuerat, contra Legem Marisci & Ordinationem prae∣dicti Henrici de Bathonia; concorda∣tum est, & ordinatum, quod nulla consuetudine a quocunque prius introducta resistente omnes & singuli Terrae & Te∣nementaQuod singuli terras & tene∣menta haben∣res quae pericu∣lo maris subja∣cent aut salva∣tionem habent pro eadem de caetero Distrin∣gantur. ibidem habentes quae periculo Maris subjacent ibidem & salvationem habent pro eadem de caetero distringantur ad Wallias & Watergagias illas reparandas & sustinendas. Ita quod singuli contribuanr equaliter juxta numerum Acrarum quas ha∣bent ibidem, ita quod nulli parcatur, cujus∣cunque fuerit status & conditionis, qui per easdem salvationem habent & defensio∣nem. Et quia in eodem Marisco de Romenal ultra cursum aquae portus il∣lius tendentem de Suergate versus Ro∣menhale ex Occidentali parte illius por∣tus usque comitatum Sussex, nulla fu∣it prius certa Lex Marisci statuta nec usitata, nisi ad voluntatem Terras habentium in eodem, per quod diversa pericula &
damna intolerabilia per Maris inunda∣tionem contingerant ut de caetero talibus periculis obvietur, & communi utilitate prospiciatur concordatum est & con∣junctim ordinatum, quod in MariscoOrdinatum est quod in Marisco ultra portum usque Sussex Juratores statu∣antur Electi pro securitate partium illarum pro ut contine∣tur in Ordina∣tione praedicti Henrici de Ba∣thonia. Calli. Lect. 39. ultra portum praedictum versus Sussex statuantur Juratores per communitatem electi qui pro securitate partium illa∣rum ad hoc jurati, habito respectu ad numerum acrarum quae dicto periculo subjacent, & ad quantitatem Wallia∣rum & Watergagiorum ibidem repa∣randorum & sustinendorum per eorum Sacramentum considerabunt & ordina∣bunt quantum necesse sit ad reparatio∣nem & sustentationem illarum, Ita quod unusquisque pro portione acrarum dicto periculo subjacentium eque contribuat, ad sustentationem earundem. Ita quod juxta portionem acrarum suarum & valorem ea∣rundem singulis assignetur in Walliis & Watergagiis praedictis portio sua perti∣carum sustinenda prout continetur pleni∣us in ordinatione praedicti Henrici de Bathonia. Et insuper quia hactenus in partibus illis ultra portum praedictum versus Sussex nullus fuerat communis Ballivus constitutus, qui de periculis i∣bidem contingentibus provideret & ca∣veret pro communi utilitate partium il∣larum, & ne de caetero consimilia pericula ibidem inveniantur, Ordinatum est, quod deQuod de caetero eligatur Balli∣vus in Mariscis ultra cursum  quae versus Suffex. caetero eligatur unus Ballivus in Mariscis prae∣dictis ultra praedictum cursum aquae versus
Sussex, ad supervidendum & custodien∣dum,Officium Ballivi. ac reparatum faciendum Wallias & Watergagias per loca & terminos toti∣us Marisci praedicti, ubi plus viderit toti communitati expedire. Et Juratores Marisci praedicti cum necesse fuerit ad loca necessaria convenire faciat, ad ordi∣nationes & considerationes suas pro salva∣tione terrarum partium illarum faciendas, & districtiones ob hoc faciendas fieri & duplum a negligentibus, cum necesse fu∣erit, levare faciat secundum formam in praedicta ordinatione Henrici de Bathonia contenta ad electionem vero praedicti Bal∣livi cum contigerit facienda semper prae∣muniantur & vocentur Domini villarum ejusdem Marisci ultra praedictum cursum aquae versus Sussex si interesse voluerint, & Juratores & tota communitas praedictiBallivus Regis in Marisco de de Romane sit supervisor Bal∣livorum & Ju∣rat in Marisco ultra cursum aquae versus Sussex.

Ordinatum est etiam quod de caetero praedictus communis Ballivus Regis in Marisco de Romane sit supervisor praedictorum Bal∣livi & Juratorum in Marisco ultra cursum aquae versus Sussex, & omnes Juratores ex utraque parte praedicti cursus aquae electos, cum necesse fuerit, ad loca necessaria con∣venire faciat ad ordinationes & considerati∣ones suas faciendas pro salvatione terrarum praedictorum Mariscorum. Ita quod semperOmnes ad ordi∣nationem & considerationem Jurat' stare. ex utraque parte praedicti cursus aquae stetur ordinationi & considerationi praedictorum Juratorum, ad minus terram perdendum & plus salvandum nulla consuetudine resisten∣te, salvo semper tenore cartae Domini Regis

THE CHARTER OF HENRY KING of ENGLAND, Concerning the Ordinance of Romney-Marsh. HENRY by the Grace of God,The Charter of King Henry the Third. King of England, Lord of Ireland, Duke of Normandy, and Earl of Andeg. To all his Bailiffs and faithful Subjects, to whom these present Letters shall come, Greeting. Because by four and twenty lawful men of Romney-Marsh (time out of mind) hereunto chosen and sworn, Distresses ought to be made upon all those which have Lands and Tenements in the said Marsh, To repair the Walls and Watergages of the same Marsh, against the dangers of the Sea. And also upon all those which are bound and charged for the reparation of the said Walls andA power grant∣ed to the 24 Iurates to make Distres∣ses. Watergages: We have granted to the same four and twenty, that for the safety of the said Marsh, they cause those distresses to be done, so that they be made equal, ac∣cording to the portions greater and les∣ser,
which men have in the same Marsh, and according to that which some are bound and charged. And therefore we will and grant, that none of our Sheriffs ofThe Sheriff or his Officers not to intermeddle with those Di∣stresses. Kent, or any his Bailiffs, do in any wise intermeddle touching those Distresses made by consideration of the same four and twenty Iurors to avoid the same danger. For whosoever shall bring Complaint unto us, of the consideration of those Distresses, we will cause Iustice to be done unto him in our Court, and that Iustice we reserve specially to our self, or our special Com∣mandment. In witness whereof, these Letters we have caused to be made Pa∣tents. Witness my self at S. Edmonds, the second day of September, in the six and thirtieth year of our Reign.
¶ The Ordinance of Henry of Batho∣nia, Iustice of our Lord King Henry, Son of King John, made by Precept of the same Lord the King, upon con∣tention arisen between the four and twenty Iurors, and the men of Romney Marsh, touching reparation of the Walls and Watergages there being, at Romney, on Saturday next after the Nativity of the blessed Virgin Mary, in the two and fortieth year of the said King Henry, adjoyning to him Nicho∣las of Handlo, and Aulred of Dene, &c. OVr Lord the King hath given inThe Ordinance of Henry de Bathonia. charge to Henry of Bathonia, that whereas Iudgment ought to be done by four and twenty lawful men of Romney-Marsh, to distrain upon all those which have Lands and Tenements in the said Marsh, to repair the Walls and Wa∣tergages of the same Marsh, against the force of the Sea, and inundation of other Waters, and also upon all those which are bound and charged with the reparation of the same Walls and Watergages. And to the same four and twenty Iuror our Lord the King by his Letters Pa∣tentsRecital of the Charter of H. 3. hath lately granted, That for safety of the said Marsh, they should cause Distresses to be made, so that they may be duly done, according to the portions,
greater or less, which men have in the same Marsh, and according as some are bound and holden hereunto. So that no Sheriff of Kent of our Lord the King, or any his Bailiffs, do in any wise inter∣meddle with those Distresses made by con∣sideration of the foresaid four and twenty Iurors for avoiding the danger afore∣said. But if any should think himself grieved unjustly touching the considerati∣on of those Distresses, and would com∣plain thereof, he should bring his Com∣plaint unto him our Lord the King, and he would cause Iustice to be done to him in his Court, and that Iustice had speci∣ally reserved to him our Lord the King, or to his special Mandate. The said four and twenty Iurors (for the considerati∣on and resistance of certain men of the same Marsh, which are bound to re∣pairThe Jurors be∣ing resisted by the Men of the Parish, cannot make their Di∣stresses. the same Walls and Watergages, ac∣cording to the Quantity of the Lands and Tenements which they have in the same Marsh) cannot make the same Distresses, whereby the Walls and Watergages lye ruinated, By reason whereof the Inundations of the Sea and other Waters do overflow a great part thereof, to the great de∣trimentThe King ap∣points Henry de Bathe his Justi∣cer to hear and determine the Controversie between the Ju∣rors and Men of the Marsh. of our said Lord the King, and men of the same Marsh. He our Lord the King, hath appointed the said Henry, his Iusticer, to hear and determine the con∣tentions arisen touching the same repara∣tion, between the same four and twen∣ty
Iurors, and men of the said Marsh. And to provide for security and defence of the said Marsh against inundation and peril of the Sea and other Waters, by reparation of the said Walls and Water∣gages to be made by them which are bound to repair it, according to the quan∣tity of the Lands and Tenements which they have in the same Marsh, and accord∣ing to that which some are otherwise bound and holden hereunto. Our said Lord the King commanding the said Hen∣ry, that at the day and place which he should limit, he should provide to dis∣patch the same, as is aforesaid: And what he shall do therein, that to him the said Lord the King he make known distinct∣ly and plainly in writing, that the same Lord the King might cause it to be inrolled, &c. By which Mandate, the said Henry, in the day aforesaid being at Romney, joyning to him the same Nicholas de Hand∣lo, and Aulred of Dene, and the Sheriff of Kent assisting him, which by PreceptThe Ordinance of Henry de Bathonia. of our Lord the King at the same day, cau∣sed to come before him so many and such honest and lawful men of his Bailiwick, by which the same Strifes may be end∣ed, and the same provision may the bet∣ter be effected, none of the same Marsh then withstanding it: The said HENRY in the presence of the Commonalty of the said Marsh then being there with their Counsel pleading, Ordained as
followeth: That is to say, that by theThat twelve men shall be chosen, viz. six of the Fee of the Archbishop, and six of the Barony, to mea∣sure the Walls and the Lands subject to dan∣ger. whole Commonalty of the same Marsh, twelve lawful men may be chosen, to wit, six of the Fee of the Archbishop of Can∣terbury, and six of the Barony, which being sworn, shall measure the Walls new and old, and those which ought to be new erected. And the same measu∣ring should be done by one and the same Perch, to wit, of twenty foots. And afterwards the same Iurors upon their Oaths also by the same Perch shall measure by all the Acres Lands and Te∣nements which are subject to danger within the same Marsh: Which measu∣rings being done, the twenty four by the Commonalty first elected and sworn, ha∣ving respect to the quantity of the Walls, Lands and Tenements which are subject to peril, by their Oath, shall ordain how much appertaineth to every one to up∣hold and repair the same Walls. So that for the portion of Acres of Lands lying subject to danger, there be assign∣ed to every one his portion of Perches by certain Bounds: so as it may be known where and by what places everyThe Jurors to assign to every man his porti∣on of Perches by certain Bounds, accord∣ing to the por∣tion of Acres subject to dan∣ger. one ought to make defencible, and when need shall be, by whose occasion the peril and force of Sea ought to be withstood by repairing the same Walls, And there ought to come the four and twenty Iurors to see through which of the same places such need chanceth, and

Within which time if they neglect to do it, the said com∣mon Bailiff of his own charge shall re∣pair such defaults by the view of the four and twenty Iurors, and the same party neg∣lecting, shall be compelled to pay double Costs to the same Bailiff for his Charges laid out upon the same reparations, which double must be reserved for the benefit of the same Reparations. And moreover, the negligent herein may be distrained by his Lands within the same Marsh. And if any Perches of Lands be holden in com∣mon ot Partners, so that to every Partner, a certain place for the portion of his part cannot be appointed, to wit, all or half a Perch by reason of the smalness of the same Perch, Then by the Oath of the four andOf Lands held in Common. twenty Iurors it shall be ordained and seen, how much the same Land which is so holden in common ought to defend, andThe Jurors to ordain how much every one is to defend. there shall be a certain portion of defence assigned to the same Partners in com∣mon for the portion of their common Land. And if any of the Partners shallIf one Partner neglects his part to be as∣signed to the o∣ther who makes his defence. be remiss in defending his part when the same Partners shall be warned by the said Bailiff, the part of the Partner so remiss,

the said Charter is contained; which Charter, this Ordinance notwithstand∣ing shall continue in his perpetual force, &c. The King to the Sheriff of KentThe Kings Writ to the Sheriff of Kent, commanding him not to meddle with the distresses made by the Jurates. greeting. Whereas we lately appoint∣ed our beloved and faithful Henry de Bathonia to hear and determine vari∣ances depending between four and twenty lawful men of Romney-Marsh, by whose consideration the Walls and Watergages of the same Marsh a∣gainst the force of the Sea and peril of other Waters there overflowing,Callis Lect. 155. ought to be repaired, and such as have other Lands and Tenements in the same Marsh, which ought and were wont to repair those Walls and Wa∣tergages. And the said Henry going in person to those parts, ordained, that according to the consideration of the said four and twenty Iurors Distres∣ses should be made for reparation of the said Walls and Watergages. So that no Sheriff or other our Bailiff do intermeddle with the same Distresses, as in the Rolls of our Chancery ex∣pressing that Ordinance is contained. Nevertheless, you have released those Di∣stresses for this Deed by four and twenty Iurors, to the prejudice of their considerati∣on. And because, if any think himself griev∣ed of the same consideration, for which he will complain, he ought to come to us to seek remedy. We command you, that in
no wise you meddle with the same Di∣stresses, but cause them to be return∣ed by the four and twenty Iurors and their Bailiff appointed hereunto, that no further complaint thereof come to us for which we may be displeas∣ed with you. Witness my self at West∣minster the twentieth day of April, in the three and fortieth year of our Reign, by Henry de Bathonia, &c. Then followeth the number of all the Acres within the same Marsh, as is found by measure taken in the two and fortieth year of King Henry, and also the agistation as well in the great Wall of Apuldre, as in the little Wall, to the quantity of the Lands holden within, &c. Hamo Pitte, John Cobbe, HenryAn Action of Trespass brought by Godfrey Fau∣coner against Hamo Pitte, & alios for en∣tring into his Mannor of Hurst and ta∣king away his Goods and Chattels. le Long, and John Ermynard, were attached to answer unto Godfrey le Fauconer, for that they with others, lately came to the Mannor of the said Godfrey in Hurst, and his Goods and Chattels there found to the value of twenty pounds, took and carried away, and oher Damages and Brievances to him there did, to his great loss, and against the Peace, &c. And whereof the said Godfrey complaineth, that on Thursday in Easter∣week in the year, &c. the same Hamo with others, took ten ine in the Town of Hurst, &c. whereby he saith, he is dam∣nified, and hath lost to the value, &c. and
thereupon bringeth sute, &c. And the said Hamo and others came and defen∣ded,The Defen∣dants Plea. &c. and so far forth as is against the Peace, &c. when, &c. and they well acknowledge that they took ten Kine aforesaid, &c. of the said Godfrey justly,Pleads by the Custom and Charter, and Justifies as Bai∣liff for a Di∣stress taken for Repairing the Walls, &c. and in the Peace of our Lord the King, because, he saith that the said Godfrey hath Lands,  &c. in Romney Marsh, where all the Tenents having Lands and Tenements in the same Marsh, ought according to the quantity of their Land, to make Walls and Waterga∣ges against the Sea for the inundati∣ons of the Waters, and four and twen∣ty lawful men of the same Marsh be∣ing chosen by the Communalty of the same Marsh, and the Iurates ought to make Distresses upon the Tenants in the same Marsh, according to the quantity of their Tenements, when it shall be need∣ful, to repair the same Walls and Water∣gages. Which Iurats in the same Marsh, as the manner is, for that they all could not be at leisure, have chosen the said Hamo to distrain, and have made him their Bailiff to do it, and this liberty they have by Ancient Custom of the same Marsh, and by Charter of our Lord the King, which they produce, in these words, Henry by the Grace of God, &c. Whereby he saith, that by means of the default of the said Godfrey, he law¦fully took the same Distress for repair∣ing the same Walls and Watergages,
of which in the Wall of Apuldre there were assigned to him for his part, by the same Iurates, three Perches and half at the least at his Charges to be repaired, And more, according to the Inundations of Wa∣ters, if it shall be needful through divers places, and that they take a greater Di∣stress, unless they will do it, they put them∣selves upon their Country, &c. Notwith∣standing, they say they took of one A. B. six Bullocks, who was the Farmer of the said Godfrey, and ten Lambs of I. N. Te∣nants of the same Godfrey, by reason of the defects of the same Walls and Waterga∣ges, for which they afterwards paid, and had their Beasts again. Being required for what they made the first Distress, and for how much the second, they say, that the first Default of the said Godfrey was esteemed at four Marks, and the second Default atThe Plaintiffs Replication that he claims his Land by Charter from the King and therefore ought to be discharged from Repairs. 48 shillings. And the same Godfrey saith, that he holdeth his Tenements in the same Marsh of the Gift and Grant of the Lord Henry, late King of England, Grandfather to our now Lord King Hen∣ry, the which the same Lord Henry hath given to one William the Son of Balder, the Predecessor of the said Godfrey, whose Heir, &c. By which Grant, his Pre∣decessors and he afterwards held his Tenements in the same Marsh, al∣ways as freely and quietly as the said Balder held them before. And they say, that neither of his Predecessors nor of him any
such Custom was ever sought to repair the same Walls and Watergages, unless five years past, after that the said Hamo was made Bailiff, to keepPrescribes gene∣generally in non reparando. Vid. Callis Lect. fol. 177. the same Walls and Watergages, nei∣ther did they ever at any time do it. And he bringeth the Charter of the said King Henry, in these words: Henry by the Grace of God, King of Eng∣land, &c. To the Archbishop of Canter∣bury, &c. And saith, that by the same Feoffment, his Auncestors have held the same Tenements so freely, that they never made nor repaired the Walls nor Watergages, neither was he, after that he held those Lands nor his Predecessors Distreined, until now five or six years past, that the said Hamo and others have took the Beasts and as they know which made upon him the same Distress for Default of Reparation of the same Walls and Watergages, which neither he nor his Predecessors have done, nor e∣ver used to do, desireth Iudgment ofThe Defen∣dants Rejoin¦der. their Acknowledgment. And the said Hamo and others say, that sometimes there was Contravers betwixt the Tenants in the said Marsh upon the Reparation of the same Walls and Watergages, so that Plea was moved thereby in the County before the Sheriff, for which the four and twenty Iurats finding themselves grieved, came to the Court of our Lord the King, and complained
of the said Sheriff, alledging that the same Plea appertained not not to the Sheriff to be holden, so that by Coun∣sel of our Lord the King it was pro∣vided that there might be sent the Iu∣stices of our Lord the King, to ordain and dispose that which should be meet to appease those Strifes. So that Hen∣ryHenry de Ba∣thonia, his Or∣dinance plead∣ed. de Bathonia was sent thether, and all the Tenants of the said Marsh had Summons of forty days, as he was in the Iourney with the Iustices. And the said Henry, having seen the Walls and Waterbanks aforesaid vp assent and will of the whole communalty of the said Marsh, hath ordained that the Archbishops, Bishops, Abbots, Pri∣ors, Earls, Barons, and all Te∣nents in the same Marsh, shall con∣tribute, according to the quantity of their Tenure, to make again the same Walls and Watergages, whereby as the said God∣frey will be defended by the Walls and Watergages, he requireth that he con∣tribute to repair them, as before the said Iustice it was ordained. And that the ordinance is such as aforesaid, he referreth himself to the Record of the Rolls of the said Henry de Bathonia. Also he saith, that it is needful that he Contribute to repair the same Walls, &c. for that he saith, that except his Land should be defended by the said Walls, all his Land would be overflown and washed. And the said Godfrey saith, that although the same
Ordinance had been made by the saidThe Plaintiffs Surrejoynder. Henry, the said Godfrey never consen∣ted thereto, neither was Summoned nor called to come before him to make the same Ordinance: He also saith, thatThat he never consented to the Ordinance of Hen. de Batho∣nia, and that neither before nor since the said Ordinance he nor his An∣cestors never made such Contribution. neither before the Ordinance nor after, he nor his Predecessors did lately make such Contribution, but always held their Land quietly from all manner of exacti∣on according to the Tenor of the said Charter of King Henry, Grandfather to the now King, until two years past, the said Hamo and others took his Beasts, whereof he prayeth Iudgment whether the same do hurt him in this behalf. And the said Hamo and others say that he had a Common Summons of forty days,Defendant re∣plies that he had a Common Summons as the other had. as all the Communalty of the same Marsh had, which he ought not to be ignorant of; whereby he saith, That although he would not come thither as he ought with his Neighbours, he ought not to be therefore freed from the same Contribution to repair the Walls, insomuch that it is the com∣mon benefit of all the Tenants in the said Marsh; that as well his Land as the Land of the other Tenants may be defended by the same Walls and Water∣gages, whereof he desireth Iudgment. He also saith, That, after the same Or∣dinance, the said Godfrey and those men have given a Mark to repair the Walls and Watergages aforesaid before the said Hamo was Bailiff, and that
he is ready to verifie the same, &c. And Godfrey saith that he holdeth himself to the same Charter of our Lord the King, and to his Liberty which he and his Predecessors used, against which none Ordinance being made by the said Henry, can nor ought to hurt him, and he well defendeth, that neither he nor any by him, hath given any thing at any time, before the said Ordinance nor af∣ter to the same Reparation. And this he isIssue joyned. ready to verifie, &c. Afterwards in the mor∣row after Saint Martin in the two and fortieth year, there came the said G. H. and others, &c. And it was commanded to the Sherist, that he cause to come, in threeVen. fac. award∣ed. weeks after Easter wheresoever, twelve aswel Knights, as, &c. by which, &c. And which nether, &c. nor have Lands in the said Marsh, &c. if the said Godfrey and his Prede∣cessors after that they had his Land of Hurst, of the Gift and Graunt of our Lord Henry, King of England, &c. together with other men, having Land in the said Marsh, were wont to repair the Walls and Water∣gages, and to contribute with the same men to repair them when it hath been needful, whereof the said God∣frey by a certain Ordinance in which he granted before Henry de Bathonia, whom the Lord the King had sent in that behalf, gave a Mark to repair the said Walls and Watergages before the said Hamo was Bailiff of the said
Marsh, as the said H. and I. do af∣firm, or if the said Godfrey or his Pre∣decessors were freed from those Repa∣rations of the Walls and Watergages and things incident thereto, by Char∣ter of the said King Henry, Grand∣father, &c. So that the said Godfrey hath not agreed to the same Ordinance, nor ever gave any thing to repair the same Walls and Watergages, as the said God∣frey alledgeth, because aswell, &c. Af∣terwards from three weeks after Easter, in the two and fortieth year the Sheriff hath not sent his Writ, therefore he in pity, &c. that is to to say, Fulk Payforor, therefore as before it is given in charge to the Sheriff, that he cause to come here fifteen days after the day of S. Trinity wheresoever, &c. twelve, &c. by which &c. and which neither, &c. After∣wards at that day there came the said God∣frey, H. and others, and desired Iudgment to be done according to the Record and Pro∣cess of the same Plea, and the Plea was re∣cited before the Lord the King and his Coun∣sel, and because it is found according to that Record, that the Lord the King had other∣wise sent Henry de Bathonia his Iustice thereunto assigned to the same Romney-Marsh, who disposed that all those which had Lands and Tenements in the same Marsh▪ should according to the quantity of their Tenements, Contribute to repair the Walls and Watergages of the said Marsh,
as the said Hamo and others alledge, to which Contribution the said Godfrey is not bound, as the said Godfrey saith, neither as yet is it manifest in the Court of the King here, of the same Ordinance and Disposition, without the which they cannot rightly pro∣ceed unto Iudgment.

Our Lord the King hath sent to his wel∣belovedThe Commissi∣on of E. 1. to Jo. Lovetot and Hen.

Know ye that whereas wee
are bound by reason of our Princely Dignity, and by Oath to provide for the safety of our Kingdom. We have assigned on every side you to oversee the Walls and Ditches by the Sea Coast, aud the parts thereto adjoyning in the County of Kent, diversly ruy∣nated by the stage of the ea to enquire by whose default such hurt hath hapned there, and of all those which hold Lands and Tenements in those parts, and by any means have Defence and Safety, or may have Defence or Safety by those Walls and Ditches, and them for the quantity of their Lands and Tenements, or by the number of Acres of Land, or by Carucates for the rated portion of their tenure to distrain together with the Bailiff of the Liberties and others of these parts to repair them in necessary places as often and where as need shall be, so that none having Lands or Tene∣ments of this or other, of what Condition, state, or dignity that they be, which have any Defence by these Walls and Ditches, whether it be within the liberty or with∣out, shall be spared in this behalf. And therefore we command you, that for the execution of this business, ye behave your selves so faithfully and discreetly, that as well men resident in the same places as their Lands, may be saved against like Perils, and casually no worse in like manner happen, and you upon that which
you shall do and ordain in this behalf un∣der your Seals, and the Seals of the Iu∣rors, as well Knights, as other honest and lawful men, you distinctly and publickly certifie us. For we have commanded our Sheriff of the same County, that at cer∣tain days and places which he shall limit them, he shall cause to come so many and such honest and lawful men of his Bayli∣wick, by whom the truth of the mat∣ter may be known and enquired in the premisses, in witness whereof, &c. Wit∣dess Edmund Earl of Cornewall our Constable at Westminster the fifteenth day of November, in the sixteenth year of our Raign By which Mandate it was commandedA Mandate to the Sheriff to return a Pan∣nel. to the Sheriff, that he should come be∣fore the said Iustices here at this day, four and twenty Iurors of Romney-Marsh, and all the Lords of the Towns of the same Marsh, and such and so many honest and lawful men of the seve∣ral Lands near to the Sea Coast in his Bay∣liwick, by which the truth of the matter in the premisses may the better be known and inquired of, and further to do that which in the premisses shall be ordained, who now came. And the said four and twenty Iurors of the same Marsh, toge∣therThe Jurors and Commu∣nalty plead the Charter of H. 8. and the privi∣ledges thereby to them grant∣ed. with the communalty of the said Marsh alledged, that the Lord, King Hen∣ry, Father of the now King, by his Char∣ter hath granted unto them certain liber∣ties in his Lands of the same Marsh, and
required that their liberties aforesaid may be reserved unto them, and that nothing be attempted or ordained to the prejudice of the same liberties, and produce a Charter of the Lord Henry our King aforesaid in these words, Henry by the Grace of God, &c. They also alledged, that the Lord the King,The Ordinance of Henry de Bathonia pleaded. Father of our now Lord the King, in the two and fiftieth year of his Raign, by rea∣son of certain discord arisen amongst divers men of the same Marsh, by means of re∣pairing the same Walls and Watergages, did send Henry de Bathonia his Iusticer to those parts, to hear and determine the strifes grown of the same Reparation, be∣tween four and twenty Iurors, and the men of the said Marsh, and to provide for the safety and defence of the said Marsh, against the overflowing and danger of the Sea and other Waters, by Repairing the said Walls and Watergages by them, which for Reparation thereof, are bound according to the quantity of their Lands and Tenements which they have in the same Marsh. Whereby they affirm that the said Henry de Bathonia, by Au∣thority of the same Mandate of our Lord King Henry aforesaid, hath Ordained and Established for them there a certain Law and Ordinance, by which that Marsh is hitherto kept and conserved, and therefore require that by that Ordinance and Law that may hereafter be tried and defended, as heretofore they have been
accustomed. And to that end they brought the same Ordinance of the said Henry de Bathonia, under the Seal of our Lord the King, in these words: Before Henry de Bathonia, &c. as afore, &c. And because the Ordinance of the said Henry plainly seemeth agreeable to equity, and hitherto hath been allowed. It is com∣manded and appointed that the same Ordi∣nance be in all points observed withoutA Confirmati∣on of the Or∣dinance of Henry de Ba∣thonia. impeachment, adding nevertheless, that be∣cause in the same Ordinance nothing was expressed of the choice of a common Bai∣liff of our Lord the King in the same Marsh, by what means and by whom that choise ought to be made, It is agreed, that from henceforth the said common Bai∣liffTo which is ad∣ded the man∣ner of Electing a Common Bai∣liff. of the said Marsh departing or decea∣sing, another which is resident, and hath Lands in the same Marsh, may have his place. And that the same choise from hence∣forth be made, by common assent of two Towns of the same Marsh, or by their Attorneys, and where the greater num∣ber agree, it shall stand at their choice, because it hath been so accustomed to be done. And for levying of the dou∣ble, and of the Costs bestowed for Re∣paration of the Defaults of the same Marsh, for the punishment of such asHow the dou∣ble shall be le∣vyed on the Defaulters. neglect to repair those Defaults, it is a∣greed, that the same double be levyed, as in the former Ordinance was appointed, and that the double be reverted, for the common
benefit of repairing the said Marsh, and notThe double Costs to be for the benefit of repairing the Marsh. be observed for the use of the same Bailiff hereafter. And because in the same Marsh divers Walls and Watergages, to whose re∣pairing and maintaining, the communalty of the same Marsh doth not contribute, but only they which have Lands adjacent and nearest to the said Walls and Watergages, and some by oppression of the Lords of the said Marsh, do pay but sometimes  the repairing and upholding of the same for 40. Acres, how much others for 50. Acres, that which shall be more against the Law of the Marsh, and Ordinance of the said Henry de Bathonia, it is agreed and ordain∣ed that notwithstanding any custom usedAll that have Lands or Te∣nements sub∣ject to the Danger of the Sea, and have thereby safety, shall be di∣strained to re∣pair. before of any, all and singular having Lands and Tenements, which are subject to the danger of the Sea, and have there also safe∣ty for the same, may henceforth be distrained to repair and support the Walls and Wa∣tergages. So that all do contribute e∣qually according to the number of Acres which they have there, so as none be spared, of what state and condition so∣ever they be, which thereby have safety and defence. And because in that Marsh of Ro∣meney beyond the Waterstream of that Dock, stretching from Suergate towards Romenhall on the west part of that Creek unto the County of Sussex, there was no certain Law of the Marsh appoint∣ed nor used, but of such as have Lands at will therein, whereby divers perils and
intolerable losses had happened by inunda∣tion of the Sea, that from henceforth such dangers may be prevented, and for common benefit seen into, It is agreed and joyntlyIt is ordained that in the Marshes beyond the Creek to∣ward Sussex, there be ap∣pointed to be chosen by the Commonalty, Jurors, for the security of those parts, as it is in the Or∣dinance of Hen∣ry de Bathonia. ordained, that in the Marsh beyond the same Creek towards Sussex, there be appoin∣ted to be chosen by the communalty, Iurors, which for security of those parts in this be∣half shall be sworn, and having respect to the number of acres, which are subject to the same peril, and to the quantity of Walls and Watergages there to be repaired and main∣tained, by their Oath shall consider and or∣dain as much as shall be needful to repair and uphold them. So that every one for the portion of Acres subject to the same danger, do equally contribute to sustain them. So that according to the por∣tion of their Acres and their value; there be assigned to every one in the same Walls and Watergages, his Por∣tion of Perches to be upholden, as is conteined more plainly in the ordinance of the said Henry de Bathonia. And moreover, for that hitherto in those parts beyond the same Dock towards Sussex, there was no common Bayliff appoint∣ed, which should provide and take had of the dangers there hapning, for the common good of those parts, and thatA Bayliff to be also chosen for the Marshes beyond the Wa∣tercourse to∣wards Sussex. hereafter no like perils there happen, It is ordained, that henceforth there be chosen a Bayliff in the same Mar∣shes, beyond the said Watercourse
towards Sussex, to oversee and keep and to repair the Walls and Watergages by the places and terms of all the said Marsh whereThe Office and duty of the Bailiff. he shall see it most convenient for the whole communalty. And cause the Iurors of the said Marsh to meet together at places requi∣site, when it shall be needful to make ordi∣nances and considerations for safety of the Lands of those parts, and to distrain there∣fore, and double to be taken of the negligent, when need shall be, and to levy according to the form in the same ordinance of Henry de Bathonia contained, at the choice of the said Bailiff, when it shall happen to be done, and that the Lords of the Towns of the same Marsh be always aiding and called beyond the same Watercourse towards Sussex, if they will be there, and the Iurors and the whole communalty of the said Marsh. It is also ordained, that from henceforth the said common Bailiff of the King in Romney-Marsh be overseer of the same Bailiff andThe Kings Bailiff of Romney-Marsh to be overseer of the Bailiff and Iurors be∣beyond the Watercourse towards Sussex. Iurors in the Marsh, beyond the Waterourse, towards Sussex, and all the Iurors on either side of the said Water∣course, chosen, when it shall be needful, do cause to assemble to execute their ordinan∣ces and considerations for safety of the Lands of the same Marshes, so that al∣ways on either side of the same Water∣course they stand to the ordinance and con∣sideration of the said Iurors, for theThe Jurors to determine all Controversies less damage and better safety of the Land, any custom notwithstanding, saving always the Tenor of the Charter of our
Lord the King granted to the communalty of the said Marsh, and the Ordinance of the said Henry de Bathonia, to indure for ever in his own force.
