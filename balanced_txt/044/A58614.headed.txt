A DECLARATION OF THE COMMITTEE of ESTATES OF THE PARLIAMENT of SCOTLAND, In Answer to some Printed Papers, Intituled, The Declaration of the Parliament of England, and the Declaration of the Army of England, upon their March into SCOTLAND. inted by Evan Tyler, Printer to the Kings most Excellent Majesty 1650.
Edinburgh Iuly. 1650. THE Estates of Parliament understanding that divers persons, Subjects of this Kingdom, with their ships and goods, had been lately seased at Sea, and carried into the Ports of England; And being likewise informed that an Army was marching Northward, to In-invade this Kingdom; Being resolved, so far as is in their power, to use all possible wayes and means to prevent War and Blood in these Kingdoms, did upon the 22. of June last, send to Messengers into England with Letters to Mr. Lenthal, Speaker of the House of Commons, the Lord Fairfax, and the Governour of Newcastle, Complaining of the Injuries done unto us, and desiring to know whither they would observe the rule and order prescribed in the large Treaty betwixt the Kingdoms, concerning the remonstrating first the breaches of Peace, seeking reparation, using all fair means, and giving three Moneths warning before any Engagement of these Na∣tions in War; to which Letters, we did long before this time expect an Answer, but in place thereof, Our messengers are there detained, and A Declaration is emitted by those, who ar∣rogate to themselves the Title of the Parliament of the Com∣mon-wealth of England, that they have judged it just and ne∣cessary, that an Army be forth with sent into Scotland, which accordingly is advancing to our Borders to Invade the King∣dom, without any previous Warning. The justice of this their
undertaking, they offer to demonstrate from the late Invasion of England, Authorised and Commanded by the Parliament of Scotland, in which designe (they say) all of us concurred to make a Prey of the English, though some difference fell amongst us who should have the greatest Power of Com∣mand, and thereby the greatest opportunity of advancing of either party, under the specious pretence of the Cove∣nant. This doth not well consist with what they say, Page 3. Concerning such in this Nation who may have kept them∣selves fee from the guilt of these things, and far lesse doth it consist with the truth, but we desire not to be our own Judges in the matter, let them ask their own Consciences whether ever any people in the World did more evidence their freedom from guiltinesse in a time of defection then we did in that mat∣ter of the Engagement against England: Did we not dissent and protest in Parliament against it? Did not all the Judicatores of the Church unanimously oppose it, and declare against it? did not the Ministers faithfully and freely Preach and Pray a∣gainst it, and generally all that feared GOD in the Land Petition against it? did they not suffer for not concurring in it? Yea, many choosed rather to expose their Lives and estates to the mercy of their Adversaries tyrannizing over them, then to contribute one six-pence toward the furthering of that En∣gagement, whereof the Commissioners of both Houses resi∣ding in this Kingdom were witnesses, as by some of their num∣ber was represented to the House of Commons, who upon consideration thereof, wrote a Leter to the General Assembly; Professing they were assured that these impious and unwarrantable Actions could not be done with the approbation and assent of the Reli∣gious and wel affected people of the Kingdom of Scotland, and that they did understand there was very few amongst those who were in the Engagement against them that first engaged with them in the
Covenant and Cause, but such as are professed Enemies to them, however they were then content to proceed thereunto, that they might the btter deceive the people of England, and that therefore they were unwilling to impute such evils to this Nation in generall: Did we not before we heard any thing of he defeat of the Engagers resolve to rise in Arms against the promoters of it, & being in Arms did we not refuse to make any agreement with them, though never so much to our advantage, untill in the first place Berwick & Car∣lile should be restored to the Kingdom of England, Concerning which, L. Generall Cromwel professed in his Letter of the 15. of October 1648, that he sho ever be ready to bear wines of our forwardnesse to do right to the Kingdom of England, and in a former Letter of the 19. September, Acknowledgeth our care of the Interest of England, and desire to preserve the unitie of both Nations: Did not both Houses of Parliament by their Votes of the 28. September 1648. appoint, that in case the Noblemen and others that dissented against the Invasion of the Kingdom of England, by the Army under the Command of the Duke of Hamiltoun shall desire the assistance of L. Generall Cromwell that he be ready to afford them all seasonable relief and assistance? which Votes were communicated to us by Lieu. Generall Cromwell himself, and in the same Letter, after a par∣ticular enumeration of all the wrongs and damages sustained by the Kingdom of England from the Engagers, he did de∣mand, in the name of England, this security, that none who had been active in, or consenting to the said Engagement, should be employed in any Publick place or tst whatsever, which was a cordingly granted by the Committee of Estates, and ratified in Parliament. Did We not also send Commissioners to both Houses of Parliament to Treat and correspond with them in all thing which might concern the continuance of the former Amitie and Friendship betwixt the Kingdoms, and authorised to joyn with them in presenting the Propositions
of Peace to his Majesty, which Commissioners were received, and our interest in the Propositions of peace acknowledged by both Houses of Parliament. This is a short, but true accompt concerning our carriage in relation to that Engagement, & how matters stand betwixt us and the lawfull authority of England: And as touching those who now quarrell with us, if their own consciences condemn them not (as we have reason to think they do) there is one greater then their consciences, even the Lord Jesus Christ, who knoweth all things, let Him Judge between us concerning the truth or falshood of that which they would charge upon us, that all of us concurred in designe to to make a prey of the English, though some difference fell out who should have the greatest power of Command. It is not the first time we have met with Calumnies of this kinde from that party, but we shall studie to bear it the more patiently; that still it is for our adherence to the Cause of Christ we are reproached: And as for the good people of England, we trust they will not readily give belief to such suggestions a∣gainst the wel-affected of this Kingdom, when they consider we have two severall times returned from England with strong Armies, when there was better opportunity to have prose∣cuted such designes. Touching what is farther said upon this point, to aggravate the miscarriages of the Engagers, in their taking of Berwick and Carlile, & invading England without an antecedent warning; We have nothing to say on their behalf, their proceedings were pal∣pably grosse & inexcusable; But if their wayes were so bad, why do these, who now prevail in England, trace their steps, not fearing their end, Will they justifie themselves in that very thing for which they have condemned others? We desire they may remember some expressions of a Letter written to us by Lieu. Generall Cromwel and his Counsell of War the 18. September 1648. shortly after the defeat of the Engagers, the
words are these: Give us leave to say, as before the Lord who knows the secrets of all hearts, that as we think a especiall end of Providence, in permitting the enemies of God and goodnesse in both Kingdoms to rise to that height, and exercise such tyranny over His people, was to shew the necessity of Unity amongst His of both Nations, so we hope and Pray, that the late glorious dispensation in giving so happie successe against your and our Enemies, may be the foundation of the Union of the people of God in love and Amity, unto that end we shall (God assisting) to the utmost of our power, endeavour to perform what may be behinde on our parts, and when we shall, through any wilfulnesse, falle herein, let this Profession rise up in judgement against us, as having been made in hypocrisie, a severe a venger of which God hath lately appeared in his most righteous witnessing against the Army under Duke Hamilton In∣vading Us, under specious pretences of Piety and Justice; We may humbly say, We rejoyce with more trembling, then to dare to do so wicked a thing. We may here also correct a mistake of theirs, where they say, by the Treaty six moneths warning was to precede Warre; tis strange how they have learnd to multiply when they speak against others, and to mince in relation to themselves: But be∣cause it may belong since they read the Treaty, We shall passe that, and only desire to know how it comes, that not only con∣trary to the Treaty, but to the law of Nations and common rea∣son, they have, without any previous warning, seased our ships, stopped our trade, and now have published a Declaration, shewing their resolution forth with to send an Army into this Kingdom, even the late Enga∣gers (who are justly condemned for not giving previous warn∣ing according to the Treaty) sent particular demands to the Houses of Parliament three moneths before invasion, which they declared they would prosecute, and about a moneth before invasion, they published a Declaration of their resolutions to
march into England. Another ground of the justice of their undertaking is, that they being invited to come into Scotland, and ha∣ving setled us in the power we now enjoy, wee exercise it for their destruction, That wee take on us to determine what is fun∣damentall in their Government, & direct & threaten them if they change not what is now established, & form it to our minde or ac∣comodate it to our interest, which they say is sufficiently cleared by the Protestation of our Commissioners the Earl of Lothian, Sir John Cheislie, & Mr. Glendoning, who have been owned & justified by the Parliament of Scotland, and no censure passed upon them. Wee shall first answer to this alleadged invitation, They say Sir Andro Ker, and Major Strachan were sent to them for that purpose, the letter then written was directed to the Comman∣der in chiefe of the forces of the Parliament of England, which wee heard were upon the borders, and we held it very necessary for us to acquaint the Kingdom of England, or any intrusted by them, that we dissented and protested against that unlawfull en∣gagement, and were then in Arms in opposition to the contri∣vers & abettors thereof, and were firmly resolved not to lay them down, untill the garrisons of Berwick & Carlile were restored to the Kingdom of England; Wee likewise gave instructions to these Gentlemen, But neither in the letter, nor instructions, as may be seen by the printed copies published by order of the House of Commons, is there any call given for the coming of the English forces into this Kingdom? We did only signifie to the Commander in chiefe of the English forces, that we were to send to the Houses of Parliament to desire their assistance, and that by joynt counsells and forces, the disturbers of the peace of both Kingdoms may be brought to tryal and condign punish∣ment, and that we expected the English forces on the borders should be in readinesse to concurre with us when we should give them a call, yet before any other addresse made by us either to
the Houses of Parliament or to those forces, yea before the an∣swer of our letter came to our hands, L. G. Cromwell marched into this Kingdom with his forces, without waiting for our call, which we did not intend to have given to them, but to have de∣sired the assistance of the Houses of Parliament, with whom this Kingdom had joyned in Covenant, and to whom we had formerly given assistance; In the next place, we were to have desired that those who were sent might be such as had signed the Covenant, and would preserve and defend the doctrine and discipline of this Church, according to the Covenant, and par∣ticularly, that none such should be sent as would disturb the peace of this Church, or vent strange opinions contrary to the Confession of Faith, directory of worship, and Church-Go∣vernment. In the third place, that their number should not ex∣ceed four thousand. And lastly, that the Garrisons of Berwick and Carlile being restored, and the engagers being subdued, or having submitted, the English forces should remove out of this Kingdome; Therefore so soon as wee received Lievtenant Gene∣rall Cromwels letter signifying that upon defeat of the forces un∣der command of the Duke of Hammiltoun, he had received com∣mands to prosecute the victorie untill the Enemie were put out of a condition of growing into a new Armie, and the Garisons of Berwick, and Carlile, were reduced; in order whereunto, he had resolved to march into Scotland, we dispatched away the Lord Marquis of Argyle, Lord Elcho, and others unto him with Instructions, desiring that the number of the forces should not exceed four thousand, that such as should come were qualified as is before expressed, And that the Garisons of Berwick and Carlile being restored, and those in Armes against us having sub∣mitted, his forces should return to England. As matters then stood, though we were very unsatilfied with many of the proceedings of that Armie, yet we could not but looke on them as the servants of both houses of Parliament, by
whose authority they acted, and to whose commands and dire∣ctions they professed obedience and subjection; wherefore the Houses of Parliament having, upon knowledge of the State of affaires in Scotland, appointed Lievtenant Gen. Cromwel, by their votes 28. September, 1648. to afford us assistance; which votes were communicated to us by Lievtenant Gen: Cromwel, on the fist of October, after serious debate and consultation upon the matter, wee judged it lawfull for us to accept from the houses of Parliament their offer of assistance, and accordinly desired that some of the English forces might stay here for sometime, and when they were to return to England, we wrote a letter to both houses of Parliament, wherein we Acknowledged the be∣nefice and advantage we had by the assistance of their forces, and gave them a testimony concerning their fair and civill de∣portment during their abode amongst us; all which wee are yet ready to acknowledge, and wish that these who had the charge and command of these forces would with the same rea∣dinesse acknowledge that they were then clearly convinced in their consciences of the reality of our detestation of, and opposi∣tion to the late unlawfull Engagement against England. But though wee have owned them sometime as servants of the Par∣liament of England, will this infer that we should own them now as their masters; by what law have they succeeded to their masters inheritance, and clothed themselves with all the power of England; have they not since that time they were in Scotland, violently seased the person of their King, and murthered him in the face of the Sun? have they not turned the point of their swords against the Houses of Parliament who gave them Com∣mission to rise in Arms, and whose priviledges they were sworn to defend? have they not taken away the House of Lords, im∣prisoned divers, and secluded most of the House of Commons? have they not overturned both civill and ecclesiastick Govern∣ment, and in place there of brought in a law lesse lliberty, and
godlesse Toleration, not withstanding their manifold Declara∣tions and solemn engagements to the contrary? had we known them as well when they were in Scotland as wee do now, wee would have looked upon them as the Prophet Elisha did on Hazael the servant of Benhaddad King of Syria when he weeped because of all the evill Hazaell was to do unto the children of Israell. They doe next charge us with Ingratitude, claime to them∣selves the title of being our preservators, and say we Exercise the power we have received by their means to their destruction, This might well have been spared, if they had remembred what assistance and preservation they had from this Kingdom, when they were very low, and their greatest Commanders (though then not very considerable) were countenanced because of their high professions for Religion and Monarchicall Government; Let the letter from L: G. Cromwell, and other Officers of that Armie written from their quarters about Bristow, to the Scottish Armie after the defeat of our forces at Kilsyth, speake what was their own sense of the releefe and assistance afforded them by the well affected in Scotland, and we shall be silent. Though wee would not detract from the commendation of any, even adver∣saries coming in a hostile way against us, but shall be ready to acknowledge all their good deeds; Yet wee may say, that while they were in Scotland, they neither shed their blood, nor sustain∣ed hardship for us, nor will the time they stayed be much a∣bove a week, for every yeare that the Scottish Armie, stayed in England for their assistance, And for any power which is in our hands, it hath been continued therein by the Established lawes of the kingdome, and the Lords blessing on lawfull and warran∣table means, and therefore wee are to exercise it for the honour of God, and the ends of that solemne Covenant which both they and wee have sworn with uplifted hands to the most high, and it cannot be made appeare that we have in the least sort ex∣ercised
our power to their destruction, unles they conceive their destruction to be included in the attainment of the ends of the Covenant which wee are inviolably obliged by the oath of God to endeavour in our stations and callings. But they insist, that wee pretend to matters of their Government, and take up∣on us to determine what is fundamentall there, and threaten them to forme it to our interest, which they say is sufficiently cleared from our ouneing and approving the protestation made by our Commissioners at London, and our not censuring them; surely they are farre to seek for a ground of Invadeing us, when they would found it upon that protestation. Is there any thing in it but a representation of their engagements & declarations, a so∣ber regrate that they have not been keeped, an earnest desire that they may be observed for the future, and incase they should pro∣ceed otherwise, a protestation that wee might be free before God and man of the guiltines, evills, confusions, miseries and calamities that might follow thereupon to these distracted King∣domes; Is it not Lawfull for us in a comon cause, wherein wee are both concerned, if wee apprehend them proceeding in an ill course contrary to our engagements, to warn them of it, and if they will not forbeare, for our own exoneration to declare that wee will not concurre with them, nor be Involved in the guilti∣nes by our silence. Will they quarrel with us for a meet profes∣sion of adherence to our principles? will they for this, now af∣ter 16. Moneths are past, come in a hostile manner to invade this Kingdome, dissolve our Judicatories by the sword, conquer and subdue the nation, force upon us a change of government Civil and Ecclesiasticall, Establish Anarchie and toleration under the pretence of furthering our just freedom and of preferring the peace and love of the Gospel to discipline and Government: How disagreeable is this to their own principles of liberty and toleration? The scriptures tell us that men may think it strange that we run not with them to the same excesse of riot, but for
men of one Nation to conquer, subdue and destroy another Na∣tion because they will not run with them, is almost a new thing on earth; however wee shall comfort our selves in this, that wee have not given them just grounds of offence, and that they shall give an account to him that is readie to judge the quick and the dead. And these are the two grounds of the justice of their underta∣king to invade this Kingdome, our accession to the late engage∣ment against England, and the owning of the Protestation made by our Commissioners, touching the first of which, We dare say, their own consciences are convinced of our Innocency, and touching the second, that their own judgments may freely ab∣solve us from all just ground of offence, if they be not altoge∣ther blinded. We shall proceed to consider in the next place their pretences for the necessity of this War, Fst, they say all faire and amicable wayes of procuring reparation of the dammages which England hath sustained by occasion of the late Invasion, have been deni∣ed, and rejected, and so We have owned the wrongs done to that Nation. First, We answer, that no application hath been made to us for any reparation; except in one Letter 23. May, 1649. and therein their demands for satisfaction were Generall; and therefore in our return 26. of June, 1649. We say they cannot so well receive a particular answer; how then have all amicable & fair wayes been used, when there was only one letter written, and that in generall terms; Secondly, the way proposed by them for obtaining satisfaction was such, as we could not agree to without sin, for they proposed that we should meet and treat with Commissioners authorized by them, on the behalfe of the Common-wealth of England, which was to acknowledge them the lawfull authority of England, which we look upon as sinfull to doe, being bound by Covenant to maintain and defend the Priviledges of the Parliament of England, which if it amount to
any thing, doth at least require that we hold them as the lawfull authority of England, and shall not give their titles and styles to any other that by force would usurpe the same, and seeing the wrong complained on, was done against England, when the Houses of Parliament were unquestionably the lawfull power in England, and now the complaint is made by those that have usurped that power, let any unprejudiced minde judge, whether there be not cause for us to make it a case of conscience, conside∣ring the strict Obligations betwixt us and the Parliament of England. Neither doe those, who would so earnestly have us to acknowledge them propound any thing to rid us out of this dif∣ficulty, for we suppose they will lay this common ground with us, that every new power which shall arise in any Kingdome, and prevaile by force, is not forthwith to be acknowledged by the neighbouring Nations, the very heathen Nations will stand at some distance in this case, & forbear to acknowledge; much more ought we to be tender in Christian and Covenanted Kingdoms. Now it is clear and evident, that there is a change both of Go∣vernours and Government in England of late, and how this change comes, they will not allow us to examine, if we speak anything relating thereunto, they tell us that we take upon us to determine what is fundamentall there. It is strange to see what latitude they can allow themselves in their own Actings, even to break and dissolve powers at their pleasure, laying aside formes (as themselves expresse it) for the substance sake, yet how exact are they in setting up their own form, requiting even from neighbouring Nations, the observance of the smallest punctili in their knowledgment of their new Titles and Stiles, other∣wise they will count it a ground of Invasion. Thirdly, Wee proposed to authorize Commissioners on behalfe of this Nation, to treat with Commissioners of both Houses of the Parliament of England sitting in freedome, concerning all matters of just complaint which either Nation
may have against the other, & for redresse & reparation thereof, and to do every thing that may conduce for the happy Peace & Union betwixt the Kingdoms, & never refused to speak & com∣mune anent any particular wrongs or redresses thereof in such a way, as did not import our Acknowledgement of their unlawfull Titles, and unlawful Parliament, which justly we esteem the pre∣sent pretended Parliament to be; for it hath often been declared by many Acts, Ordinances, Declarations and Protestations, that the Parliament of England doth consist of King, Lords and and Commons, and should never be altered: and in the begin∣ning of that Parliament, it was enacted by King, Lords and Com∣mons, that that same very Parliament should never be raised, nor dissolved, without consent of both Houses of Parliament. Fourthly, We answered to the matter of that Letter sent to us, so far as the generality of the expressions would guide us to conjecture what they meant; and if any other wrongs should be made known to us, we promised to return such an answer as might give just satisfaction: and untill this Declaration came to to our hands, We never understood that they were unsatisfied with our Answer, for that dormant Declaration of theirs, dated the 14. July. 1649. never came to our hands, either in write or Print till now; nor do we think that ever it saw the light, till the publishing f their other Declaration of the 26. of June last, 1650. which came to our hands but the other day; How then can they with a good conscience say, that all fair and amicable wayes have been used and rejected. Fiftly, Although we cleared our own innocencie in the mat∣ter of that Engagement, yet when it was demanded, that those who were guilty, should not be employed in places of publick trust, it was granted accordingly; and it was never craved (and so was never denyed by us) that they should be lyable to give satisfaction for the wrongs and dammages sustained by England; And while they demand satisfaction, they might very well have
remembred that the mony and great spoil which they got from that engaging Army, was very considerable, and should like∣wise have remembred that the Irishes who were Subjects of the Crown of England, had contrary to the large Treaty where∣in England was bound to suppresse them; done much more harm in this Kingdome, and that no reparation or satisfaction was given, though frequently and earnestly pressed, all which being considered, it is most apparent, that all faire and ami∣cable wayes have not been used, and so the inference which they would make, that we have owned the wrongs and dam∣mages done by the late Invasion of England, falls to the ground. The next reason of the necessity of their Invasion of Scotland, is taken from the design and resolution which they say we have to invade England; And this they would have appear, first, be∣cause when they demanded a Treaty for satisfaction for the for∣mer Invasion, we have in expres termes, declared our selves ene∣mies to the Government of their Common-wealth. This hath been already cleared, that we cannot acknowledge them to be the lawfull authority of England, which they would as∣sume to themselves excluding the King, the House of Peeres, and the fare greatest part of the House of Commons. We would gladly know vvhat Law, Reason, or Conscience, there is obliging us to acknowledge their usurpations to be lawfull actions, and though we have professed that we can∣not acknowledge them; and declared our resolution not to com∣ply vvith them, hovv doth it follovv, that therefore vve have resolved to invade England, have we not often declared our judgement against Popery, and Tyranny in other Nations, yet, neither did they fear, nor we so much as dream of an intended Invasion. Secondly, They would prove our intended Invasion of England, in that we have taken upon us to proclaim the Kings Majesty, whom they term Charles Stewart, to be King of Eng∣land
and Ireland, and in our Treaty since have promised him assistance against England, to which we answer, That we claim no authority or jurisdiction over them, and when the King was proclaimed, our Records were searched, and he was pro∣claimed with the same titles his Father was proclaimed both in England and Scotland, he was first proclaimed in England as King of Greet Brittain, and then in Scotland, and neither Nation took exception against the other, or conceived that there was any claim of Jurisdiction, or any Invasion intended, more then there was in relation to France, of which he was proclaimed King by both Kingdomes, and as to the promises made in the Treaty of assistance against England, there is nothing of that kinde in the Treaty, but that which hath been long since published to the world in the proceedings of our Commissioners the last yeer, to wit, that this Kingdome would contribute their utmost en∣deavours by all necessary and lawfull meanes according to the Covenant, and the duties of faithfull and Loyall Subjects, that his Majesty may be restored to the peaceable possession of his other dominions, accoding to his undoubted right of succession, which both Houses of the Parliament of England, and those who make this pretence of Invasion of this Kingdome, did pro∣test and declare they would never wrong not alter. And further, The Estates or Parliament have declared to his Majesty, that the expressions of the Treaty concerning our en∣deavours for his restitution to his other dominions, shall not im∣port any Engagement or Obligation upon this Kingdome to make Warre in England or Ireland, without the previous consi∣deration, and determination o the Parliament of this King∣dome, and the Generall Assembly of this Kirk, or the Commis∣missioners of this Kirk, concerning the lawfulnesse and necessi∣tie thereof, which was never so much as taken into considerati∣on in either of them to be debated, much lesse to be determined, and our Letter 6. of March, renewed the 22. of June last, decla∣reth
our obligation, and resolution to observe, the Articles of the large Treaty, so that it remains very clear from our procee∣dings, that there was no design layed, or resolution taken by this Kirk or Kingdom, to invade the Kingdom of England. Fifthly, They say the Engagers refused to treat with the Par∣liament of England, and they were answered only with the im∣mediate March of an Army into England, therefore we having refused to treat with them, they are to expect the like, but the difference is very wide and manifest, both in relation to persons and proceedings, if they had considered all things duely, they should have ranked us with the Houses of Parliament, and them∣selves with the Engagers, for their wayes are not unsuitable. What they alleage concerning the refusall of a Treaty with them hath been answered abundantly, Neither have we marched im∣mediately after our Answer into England, as the Engagers did, there are now 12. Moneths elapsed since our answer to their Letter, and they will finde us yet in Scotland. Fourthly, they say, we have equally declared against them as Sectaries as against those of Montrosse his party, ranking them with Malignants and Papists, though we know the faith which they professe; But our declaring against Sectaries in Eng∣land, doth no more prove a design to invade them, then our de∣claring against Malignants in England, or the bloody rebels in Ireland, or Papists in France or Spain, doth prove a design to in∣vade them. To declare against the sinfulnesse of any course of back-sliding apostasie or rebellion in another Nation, (either for our own vindication from jealousies and suspicions, or to warn the Subjects of this Kingdome to keep themselves from the like defection, and from complyance) or the declaring our judgement in a way of friendly admonition, will not be found a probable ground to argue, much lesse to be an evidence of a designe to invade another Nation; there may be many sufficient grounds which may warrant to give a testimony against an evill
course that will not give a good calling to make a War against it. Concerning the Faith which they professe and say, cannot but be known unto us; this is the first confession of their faith that we have seen, and it is so short, that we shall not wrong them to comment upon it, untill they shall be pleased to give us a larger, but touching the desire which they professe to restrain licenti∣ous practises, and to have them punished by the Magistrate, they can never satisfie the world, nor the most charitable disposition that is in it, that there is any such desire in their hearts so long as their practises be quite contrary, the fig-trees leaves of flou∣rishing words, may seem to serve for a covert, wherein to lurk from the eyes of men, but how do they think to escape the sear∣cher of hearts, before whom all things are naked; yea, we think they should be ashamed to say it before the world, that they are ready to beare witnesse against licentious practices, and desirous to restrain and punish them, and yet for all their readinesse and desire, be silent and fit still, we wish they did not countenance and encourage them; and shewed not themselves too ready and active against others, who strive to keep their garments cleane, and to be free of that contagion. When they have laboured to vindicate themselves, they return to cast aspersions upon us, and would have it believed that interest, dominion, and profit un∣der pretence of Presbytery and the Covenant, is our designe wherein (though we be conscious to our selves of many sinnes and infirmities in the prosecution of the work of the Lord, yet) since we are so grossely charged, we trust we may in humility and sincerity of heart, desire that he who knoweth the secrets of hearts, may judge between them and us, vvhether they, doe not falsely accuse us, and vve seriously exhort them to consider whether under the pretences of preferring the peace and love of the Gospel, to the Discipline & Government of the Church, they be not undermining and subverting the Ordinance and Govern∣ment of Jesus. Christ, that they may set up the devices of their
own heart, and erect a sanctuarie for errors, heresie, and schisme. And now having answered the reasons given by them to make it appear that we had a designe to invade England, we shall give clear evidences that we neither had, nor have any such design; First, The Estates of Parliament having about the end of Febru∣ary 1649. received severall Intelligences that there was a design in England to invade this kingdome, did then appoint a levie of horse and foot; but withall, declared (as is expressed in the nar∣rative of the said Act of Levie, then published in Print) that they did enjoyn it only for the meer just and necessary defence of this Kingdome from Invasion without any design or intenti∣on, against any who shall not first invade this Kingdome, and so soon as they understood that the forces raised in England, were marching for Ireland, they made stop of their Levy. Also upon the 6. of March, 1649. they wrote a Letter to Mr. Lenthall Speaker of the House of Commons, declaring that it was very farre from their intention to assume any power over the Lawes and Government of England, or any wayes to raise sedition, or lay the grounds of a new Warre, or doe any thing in pursuance of the late unlawfull Engagement, and that no such thing could be inferred from the paper given in by their Commissioners containing only an adherence to our former Principles acknow∣ledged by both Kingdoms. That they were so tender of the uni∣on betwixt the Nations, that they did think the remonstrating of the breaches of Peace, the craving of just reparation, and the using of all fair and amicable means, should be first essayed, and then three moneths warning should be given according to the large Treaty before any Engagement in warre, and they expe∣cted the like from England; and however any prevalent party in either Kingdome, had infringed, or might break these bonds, yet they did not conceive it either agreeable to Gods will, or conduccable to the welfare of these Nations, to lay those sacred tyes aside, as dissolved and cancelled, but rather that they should
be preserved for the good of both Kingdomes, and benefit of those who have no accession to such breaches, and of succeding generatins, who are innocent thereof, and may sustain mani∣fold inconveniences, by dissolution of the same. To this Letter we never received any answer, nor any reply to our Letter of the 26. June, but all this spring for these three or four moneths past, have weekly heard of great preparations made against us, both by Sea and Land, yet untill the Estates of Parliament understood that the English Forces were upon their March North-ward, and some of our Ships were taken at Sea, they did not so much as make ready for our Defence, and so soon as they took any resolution therein, which was about the middle of June before they made any dispatch to the Shires: Upon the 22. of June they sent Messengers to Eng∣land with Letters to Mr. Lenthal, Speaker of the House of Commons and others, wherein they complain of the wrongs done unto them, and desire redresse, declare their obligations and resolution to observe the rules, prescribed in the large Treaty, before any engagement in War, and desire to know whether these who have the present power in England, do acknowledge themselves obliged, or will oblige and declare their resolutions to observe the way and order aforesaid, and plainly and clearly to declare, whether they march for offence or defence, and withall acquainted them in that Letter, that they had renewed the Acts of Leavy, and for Posture of De∣fence, made the last yeer, wherein the same narrative is kept, as in the former, and in the power granted by the Parliament to the Committee of Estates: It is expresly excepted and re∣served that they shall not have any power to give orders to the Forces of this Kingdom for any other ends, then for the just and necessary defence of this Kingdom. Upon the whole matter, there is neither justice nor necessity of their present undertaking against us, nor can it be laid that
all fair and amicable wayes and means which were used have been refused, but on the contrary, we have since that pretended refusall used the means to prevent a War, and yet an Army is on our Borders ready to Invade us: Wherefore we may safely conclude that there is no just cause, much lesse any necessity for them to Invade this Kingdom, and if they shall Invade us, that we are obliged by all Laws, both of God and man to stand to our own just and necessary defence. Whilst this Declaration was under consideration, there was another sent unto us by a Trumpeter from L. Generall Crom∣well, Intituled, A Declaration of the Army of England, upon their march into Scotland, to which, except where we meet with repetitions, we have resolved to make a further answer, And first to the way of addresse, set down in the fronti∣spice of that Paper; It is not directed to those in Authority, more then to any other persons in the Kingdom, but after this manner, To all that are Saints and partakers of the Faith of Gods Elect in Scotland; So, as if there be none in Authority, whom they apprehend Saints, it is directed to none of them, Can there be a more lively portraytour of Anarchie in the World then this? and that varnished over with the colour of Piety and Religion! or can there be a more seditions, usurping way devised, to draw away the hearts of the people from their obedience to Authority? May we not here with great reason return them their own words, They pretend to matters of our Government, and take upon them to determine what is funda∣mentall here, and direct and threaten us, if we change not what is Established, and form it to their minde, or accomodate it t their In∣terest, And may we not justly declare against them, as they did in another case, most uniustly against us; That the said Paper doth contain much scandalous and reproachfull matter against the just proceedings of the Parliament of this Kingdom, and an assu∣ming to have power over the Laws and Government of this Nation
to the high dishonour thereof; And lastly, a designe in the contri∣vers of it to raise sedition, and lay the grounds of a new War in this Land. They begin with sugeed words, wihing like mercy and tuth, light and liberty with themselves; but are march∣ing with an Army to conquer and subdue us cruely, under er∣rour, darknesse and slavery; and then they urther preface, with a desire to make a distinction and sepaation betwixt some and others in this Kingdom; but, blessed be the Name of the Lord, there is not a different thought amongst all the godly in this Land concerning the unlawfulnesse of their Invasion, and the lawfulnesse of our defence against the same: They boast much of their great successes, and reproach the Great Name of the Lord of Hosts, fathering upon him their transgressions, but consider not that the Lord might have a hand of justice, in the same things wherein they had a hand of injustice and that he in His wise dispensation can correct one extreame by another, and yet remain displeased with both. They be∣gin also with an appeal (concerning the truth of the particu∣lars, which they are to remonstrate) to the Lord, who should they come to day of engagement (they say) will be a sore witnesse against them, it they utter these things out of hypo∣crisie, and they end with another appeal concerning the tuth of what they have said, desiring the God of Heaven to Judge them accordingly, when they come to meet their enemies in the field, to which we shall say no more, but beseech the Lord to look upon these provocations, and to vindicate the honour of His great Name. They labour in the first place to make good their proceed∣ings in relation to the late King, from his actions, which we intend not to justifie, But who made them the Kings Judge? or where is there warrant to take his life: When such a thing was suggested to David (though anointed King of Israel) against Saul, who was rejected of the Lord, he said, The Lord
forbid that I should do this thing: wickednesse proceedeth from the wicked, but mine hand shall not be upon him. They endeavour to vindicatte their actions against the Houses of Parliament, and concerning the change of the fundamentall Government from the true and equitable intent of the constitution of Eng∣land, which we shall not insist upon to answer, but we think they might with as great confidence have said to us, that white is black, and black is white, and bring arguments to make us be∣leeve it to be so in England, They would also cleer their proceed∣ings from the example of ours, in the yeer 1648. for (say they) We acted contrary to Acts of Parliament, and called a new one, excluding whom we thought fit; all which was done by vertue and authority from the Committee of Estates, which was no Committee, being constituted of such persons, as by Act of the foregoing Parliament had not legall right to sit or Act therein, they not having taken the Oath in reference to the late engagement which was enjoyned by Parliament, or else to have no place therein. To which e answer, that whatsoever we acted, was in per∣formance of the solemn League and Covenant, and Treaties be∣twixt the Kingdoms, which are above any Act of Parliament, and according to which, the Committee of Estates were by their Commission bound and appointed to mannage the affaires of the Kingdome. The solemn League and Covenant, being an oath to God allowed and appointed by the authority of both Kingdomes, cannot be repealed, or made void by any subse∣quent Acts of Parliament though of both Kingdomes; nor can all the powers on earth absolve those that have taken it from their duty therein expressed, by vvhich they are bound all the dayes of their lives, zealusl & constantly to continue in main∣taining and pursuing the ends thereof against all opposition, and to promote the same according to their povver against all lets and impediments vvhatsoever.
2. What we acted was for our ovvn just defence against an actually oppressing Army, whose proceedings were so wick∣ed and boundlesse, as they were not only contrary to the Co∣venant and Treaty betwixt the Kingdomes, but to the very Acts and Determinations of the Parliament from whom they had their Commission. 3. Though the Members of the Committee of Estates were appointed at their first meeting in the Committee, to accept their Commission, and give their oaths for faithfull discharge of the trust reposed in them, in reference to the Engagement a∣gainst England, or else to have no place therein, yet there is no∣thing in the Act of Parliam-declaring their proceedings null, and void, incase they did not take the Oath aforesaid, and the Enga∣gers themselves did admit some to sit and vote, who did not tak that Oath: will it therefore necessarily follow, that all which they did, was in Law null and void? Besides, the last Act of Parliament concerning the power of the Committee of Estates, doth not at all limit the Members to any Oath. 4. It was agreed in the Treatie at Sterling, by common con∣sent, that such Members of the Committee of Estates, as were accessory to the Engagement, should forbear coming to the Committee of Estates, untill the next Session of Parliament; to which, the determination of differences were referred, and our whole proceedings were ratified by the Parliament, and now also by the Kings Majesty. We have not done any thing against our Vowes, Oaths, Co∣venants, Protestations and Declarations, as they have done; but in pursuance of them, we have acted in our own defence a∣gainst visible and actuall tyranny and oppression, not upon jea∣lousies or suspicions against a Parliament, consulting and voting peaceably, as they have done. We have adhered to the Lawes and Constitutions of the Kingdom, and have not altered the fundamentall Government thereof, as they have done, without
any power, warrant, or calling. But what suppose they were able to justifie their proceedings, as they are not, what would that contribute for to nuke up a just ground for invading the Kingdom, even suppose they had the authority of both Houses sitting in a full Parliament, and the Kings consent thereunto, they have no power or jurisdiction over this Kingdom, the Lord hath been pleased these many hundred yers to preserve our Freedome, whilst there was little knovvledge of the Gospel in the Land: And vve do confidently trust in his Name, and are persvvaded, that hee vvill not novv give us up to the vvilland povver of those that vvould bring in Darknes for Light, Errour for Truth; and instead of Government, make vvay for Tolera∣tion, Anarchie and Confusion. If Treaties be urged against them, they were broken, say they, by the full Authority of the Parliament of Scotland, they very well know the contrary, that a very considerable number of the Parliament protested against it (which certainly even in Law much weakened the Authority) and that it was revoked by the full Authority of Parliament, and the House of Commons, in their Letter to the Generall Assembly, hath acknowledged us free of it, and our Commissioners have been since admitted and received by both Houses of Parliament, and our Interest in the Treaty acknowledged, as hath been already more fully expressed. How well can they take upon them to person at the Houses of Parliament (whom they have broken in pieces) in making up challenges against us, but they will not owne their actions in any thing that may plead for us. They insist, that the breach is not made up so, as to challenge England on agree∣ments, unlesse we think that Scotland may break, and England should remain bound, whereas it is a known Law of Nations, that in the breach of the League by the one party, the other is no longer obliged; We never said, either that the one King∣dom could be free, and the other bound; or, that the one King∣dom
having broken, the other was obliged to keep; if reparati∣on of the wrong done was refused; but that notwithstanding a prevailing Party break, yet both Kingdomes are bound still a∣gainst the breaking Party, and that reparation ought to be made. This will appear, if the scope and intent of the large Treaty made betwixt the Kingdoms, be considered, as it is expressed, to wit, That the great blessing of a constant and friendly conjun∣ction of the two Kingdoms, now united by alleageance and loy∣all subjection to one Soveraigne and Head, may be firmly ob∣served and continued to all posterity, it is agreed, &c. And words to the same purpose are again twice repeated, the severall cases of breaches of the Peace which may fall out; and the way of remedy are set down: for Commissioners are appointed in the Intervals of Parliaments for conservation of the Peace, to which Commissioners in the Intervals, as afterward to Parlia∣ments, all breaches are to be remonstrated, which had been al∣together needlesse, if every breach of the Treaty had made it null and void: According to this sense, the Houses of Parlia∣ment have formerly declared, particularly in the year 1641. when there was some appearance of the beginning of trouble in this Kingdom, the Houses of Parliament did in their sense and apprehension of the Nationall Allince betwixt the Kingdoms settled and confirmed by the large Treaty and Acts of Parlia∣ments of both Kingdoms declare, that they were bound to apply the Authority of Parliament and power of England to the preservation & conservation of our Peace, & when the troubles of England, did grovv to a greater height, about the end of the year 1642. the Houses of Parliament did again declare, that see∣ing the subtile practice of the common Enemy of the Religion and Liberty of both Nations, did then appear in England, with more evidence, strength & danger than it did in Scotland the for∣mer year: therefore in their judgment, the same obligation did ly upō their Brethren of Scotland by the afore-mentioned Act, vvith
the power & force of this Kingdom to assist England in repressing these amongst them who were in arms against the Parliament, & fordestruction thereof from which & other Declarations, and the expresse meaning and intent of the Treaty; it may be easily collected that what wrong is done by the common enemies of both Kingdoms, though it ought to be repaired, yet it is not to be looked on as that which should cancel and dissolve the Treaty and the mutuall amity and alliance that is betwixt the Kingdoms, but that either Kingdom ought when they ae desired and called thereunto to be assistant to other in their strts, and the treaties ought to continue undissolved, and to be preserved for the good of the present and future generati∣ons, unles it be intended that they shall for ever herefter re∣main in hostility, or that the one shall conquer the other; for they cannot be tyed by stricter bonds then they are already. If the Covenant be alleadged against them, they affirm they have kept it religiously, which they would make out by a distinction thus; The Articles concerning Religion and civil Liberties have the first place in the Covenant (say they) and these which concern the Kings Interest and constitution of Parliament the last, and these with subordination one to an∣other, the Covenant tyed them to preserve Religion and libertie as the ends of it, even when these were inconsistent with the preservation of the Kings Interest and the frame of Parliament, because when the means and the end cannot both be injoyed together the end is to be preferred to the means. That there was a reall inconsistence, because the Houses accepted of his Majesties concessions at Newport, which were destructive to Religion and the Covenant, and acquiesced therein, but the Armie appeared against them, and so Re∣ligion and liberties are preserved; But first there is no such di∣stinction in the Covenant betwixt Articles, as that one is a
meane, and another an end, though each of them may con∣duce to the strengthening another, the ends are expressed in the title, narrative and Articles thereof, and are unitive and copulative not disjunctive, nor is there any inconsistencie be∣twixt the Articles and ends thereof, otherwise it had been unlawfull for to have taken the Covenant. And the third Ar∣ticle, with which they quarrell most, doth oblige us expresly to endeavour the prosecution thereof with the same sincerity, reality and constancy as the rest; Neither regall nor Parlia∣mentary Government are in their own nature inconsistent with the preservation of Religion; It were absurd to say so, both reason and experience evidencing the contrary, and there is great fallacie in the argument given to prove their inconsi∣stencie, for the Instance is concerning the actions of Govern∣ours, which are sad to be destructive to Religion, But what is that to the Government, they might as well have reasoned thus; The English Army did in the yeer 1647, offer propo∣salls to the King, which were destructive to religion, there∣fore the Army must be taken away, and we will have no more Armies: If then the preservation of Religion and the civil Government be consistent, as the Covenant it self doth ne∣cessarily presuppose, then certainly our endavours to pre∣serve them may very well consist, and ought to be performed with sincerity, realty and constancie, and unavoidably it will follow, that an endeavour to destroy any of them is a cleare breach of, and inconsistent with our Covenant and oath to God, their distinction then falls to the ground, and conse∣quently their conclusion, so that their endeavouring to de∣stroy and actually destroying the King, and changing the fun∣damentall Government, is in our judgement so far from being a keeping of the Covenant, as it is a clear and evident breach thereof. It might have been much more strongly argued for Zedekiah
then any thing that can be said in the present case, that the keeping of his oath, made to the King of Babylon was destru∣ctive to Religion, and inconsistent with his dutie to God, as King of Israel, and with the civil liberties of the people of God, when the King of of Babylon had spoiled the temple and carried away all the Princes, all the mighty men of vallour all that were apt for war, and all that were crafts men and smiths, that the Kingdom might be base and not lift it self up, yet what saith the Spirit of GOD, Shall he prosper? Shall he escape that doth such things? Or shall he break the Covenant and be delivered? As I live saith the Lord God, surely in the place where the King dwelleth that made him King, whose Oath he despised, and whose Co∣venant he brake, even with him in the midst of Babylon shall he die. When it was alleadged against the late engagers, that their invading England was contrary to the 5. Article of the Cove∣nant, by which they were obliged to endeavour that the Kingdoms may remain conjoyned in a firm Peace and union to all posteriy; they were ready under the pretences of en∣deavoring the reformation of Religion, the rescuing of his Majesties Person and preservation of the priviledges of the Parliament of England, to declare before God and the world that they were resolved never to break the Union betwixt the Kingdoms, nor to entreanch upon the Nationall rights of the subjects of England, or their liberties, not considering that the Articles of the Covenant were unitive and copulative, and that the Covenant is broken, and not kept, when any one Ar∣ticle thereof is broken. And now under the like pretences of the advancement of Gods glory and the furthering just free∣dom, the Sectaries are invading Scotland, contrary to that 5. Article of the Covenant, but the same Lord who avenged the quarrell of His broken Covenant upon the late Engagers, lives
and reigns to avenge it upon the Sectaries. Whereas they mention their appearing against the Houses of Parliament, who had accepted of the Kings concessions at New∣port, which were destructive to Religion, and that thereby they have preserved both Religion and Liberty, how do they know that Religion and Liberty would have been destroyed if they had not appeared? the Lord could have preserved them by law∣full means, and stands not in need of sinfull assistance to accom∣plish his work: But how they can say to those that fear the Lord in Scotland, that Religion and Liberty are now preserved, we ve∣ry much wonder, let them read over that testimony of the Kirk of Scotland against Toleration, (from which they borrow that proof that the Kings concessions were destructive to Religion) and compare it with the state of Religion this day in England, and they shall find in the Judgement of the Kirk of Scotland, Re∣ligion is by that Army endeavoured to be destroyed, and not preserved. As their arguments from inconsistence doe not, so these taken from the subordination of the ends of the Covenant, will much lesse help them; Gods Ordinances are not contrary to, nor destructive of other; Christ commands us to give unto God what was Gods, and also unto Caesar what was Caesars, which is agreeable to that known maxim subordinata, non pugnant; some duties doe deserve preference to other, yet never so, as to take off the obligation of endeavouring to perform other duties so farre, as is in our power, much lesse doth it allow us a liberty to doe the contrary; we should not be carnally wise, and over anxious about the issue, but ought to perform duties according to Gods revealed will, and leave the event to him. The Ma∣lignants under a pretence of doing duties to the King, neglect all duties to God; and the Sectaries under pretence of Religion and Liberty, neglect all duties to the King, but neither of these wayes have been blessed of God, the Malignants have never done reall service to the King, but were seeking their own interest, and
and ends under the pretence of his service; so the Sectaries for all their fair pretences to preserve and defend Religion, are but destroying it, & can dispense with oathes and sacred Covenants, in order to their own interest; making Religion subservient to their particular ends. When the Covenant is alleged against their proceedings for changing the civill Government, the Army saith that they have kept it religiously, and they labour to answer objections to the contrary, by distinctions, granting that they have alterd the form, but say they have kept the substance, but those who claim to be the Parliament of the Common wealth of England, would seem to deal more ingenuously in their Declaration of the 14. July, 1649. for say they, the Parliament hath not by the Covenant Treaties and Declarations, excluded it selfe from the use and ex∣ercise of the supream legislative authority, to alter, repeal, and make voyd any thing whatsoever, appertaining to the Govern∣ment of that Nation, or if they have, it is not to be imagined, that any Covenant, Treaty or Declaration in that behalf, could be binding in things which a Parliament cannot give away from if selfe; or lastly, if any thing of that kind could be urged from the Covenant, Treaties, and Declarations, the late Invasion of Eng∣land hath cancelled it, and made it invalide, as to any obligation upon England. They plainly disclaim all obligations by the Co∣venant, in relation to the preservation of the form of Govern∣ment, yet what strange subterfuges are here, perhaps they would be thought to have some regard to the Covenant. In a word, that which they say, is, either there is nothng in the Cove∣nant, which rerstrains the use and exercise of the legislative au∣thority in altering any thing appertaining to the Government of that Nation, or if there be any thing in it of that nature, it is not binding, or if it be binding, the late Engagers of Scotland have loosed if, and so it is cancelled. Is it not a wonder to see how men can so dally with the oath of God, and how their
consciences can rest upon such doubtfull alternatives, and yet in all this hesitation and darknesse, act so forwardly. As to the first case which they make, it is very clear that they are bound by the Covenant all the dayes of their lives, to endeavour to pre∣serve the rights and priviledges of the Parliament, and if any rights or priviledges, certainly these which the Parl. hath both before, and since the taking of the Covenant, declared to be fun∣damentall, they are likewise to endeavour to preserve the Kings person and authoriy, in the preservation and defence of the true Religion, and Liberties of the Kingdoms, that the world may bear witnesse with their consciences of their loyalty, and that they have no thoughts or intentions to diminish his Majesties just power and greatnesse, and herein the legislative authority is undoubtedly restrained and limited from all endeavours to the contrary. And as to the second case where they say it cannot be binding, they know they should not change, though they sweare to their hurt, the Almighty (blessed bee his glo∣rious name) holdeth himselfe obliged to keep Covenant, even with his owne Creatures, and shall not the creature be bound to keep Covenant, when they swear to him. Wee know not what a vast power they would ascribe to their legis∣lative authority, but as it is used, it seems to be like that mad∣man in the Gospel that brake all bands, so as nothing could hold him fast. The power of dispensing with oathes, is condem∣ned in Popes and Princes, and there is no reason to maintain the same power in others. Neither will the third serve their turn, to say that the late Engagers have broken the Covenant, and so they are free; for the transgressions of others, cannot ab∣solve their consciences from the obligation of a Covenant made with God, the knowledge of their sin and punishment, may well aggravate their guiltinesse in the sight of God. We shall say no more on this subject, but pray the Lord to direct us, sincerely and uprightly to minde all the ends of the Covenant, and to keep us from declining or shifting the obligations which it lay∣eth
upon us as some doe, and from that which others call a re∣ligious keeping of it, though they break it in some Articles. For Presbyteriall Government (they say) it is not to be im∣posed by force, but wherefore have they opposed by force the Establishing of it as was Ordained by the Houses of Parlia∣ment, and if they desire not themselves to be forced to any way, why came they in a hostile mannner to force their wayes upon us: Certainly that is no effect of Faith, working by Love. They tell us of the danger we are in from Malignants, and bring in one instance from the procedings of some Lords and others in the North of Ireland, and another from the late en∣gagers against England, to which we say, that we are so far associating with Malignants, as we have neither admitted them to trust in our Counsels or Armies, nor permitted them to come into our armies, but have discharged them under high penalties, yet however, we do acknowlege there is dan∣ger from the pretences of Malignants, but that is no argu∣ment why we should not also beware of the smooth pretences and dangerous insinuations of Sectaries: We trust the Lord, who hath called us to a triall on both hands, will with the tentation give us the issue: We must not be discouraged, but rather count it all joy when we fall into divers temptations. Concerning our agreement with his Majestie; we know there is scarce any possibility to satisfie those who have de∣clared themselves enemies to Monarchicall Government, but we desire all good men to consider how we have been led thereunto by following our duty in prosecution of the Natio∣nall and solemn League and Covenant. After the death of his Majesties Father, having sought the LORD for his direction and had serious consultation amongst our selves, wee found it a duty lying upon us by Covenant (where∣in wee have professed in the sight of GOD that wee had before our eyes the Honour and Happinesse of the KING and his Posterity, and made an appeal to the World as
witnesses with our consciences of our loyaltie, and that we had no thoughts to diminish his Majesties just Honour and Great∣nesse) that we should proclaim and declare to all the world his Majestie to be by the providence of GOD, and Lawful Right of undoubted succession and descent, KING of Great Britain, France and Ireland, and that all the Subjects of this Kingdome were bound faithfully to obey Him, maintain and defend Him according to the Nationall Covenant, and the Solemn League and Covenant betwixt the Kingdoms, with all declaring, that before He were admitted to the exercise of His Royall Power, He should give satisfaction to this Kingdom in these things that concerned the security of Religion, the Union betwixt the Kingdoms, and the good and Peace of this Kingdom, resolving for that end, to make our humble and earnest addresses to His Majesty. This was the onely way left unto us to prosecute our dutie, without giving advantage to Malignants upon the one hand, who would admit Kings, without minding any thing of Religion, or else giving advantage to Sectaries upon the other, who without regard to the obligation lying upon them by Co∣venant, have altered the Fundamentall Government. Ha∣ving made application to His Majesty once and again, He hath now given satisfaction to all our Demands, for he hath sworn and subscribed the Nationall Covenant, and the So∣lemne League and Covenant, acknowledged the Authority of Parliament, and approved the acts thereof, agreed that all matters Civil be determined by the Parliament, or such as shall be authorised by them, and all matters Ecclesiasticall by the Generall Assembly of this Kirk, or such as shall be authorized by them. He hath further agreed to recall and disclaim all Commissions issued forth for acting any thing by Sea or Land, to the prejudice of the Covenant, or of the Kingdom of Scotland, or of any, who do or shall adhere to the Solemn League and Covenant and Monarchicall Government in any other of his Majesties Dominions, and all Declarations
made by any in his name, or by his warrant against the same, and that he shall disallow and disclaim, or declare null and void all Treaties and agreements with the bloody Rebels in Ireland, and that he will never allow nor permit any liberty or the Popish Religion in any part of his Dominions; That he shall swear the Coronation Oath, and that he shall then declare he will in matters Civil follow the Counsell of his Parliaments, and such as shall be authorised by them, and in matters Ecclesiasticall, the Generall assembly, and such as shall be authorized by them. Having granted these Demands, and the Lord in his providence having brought him amongst us, and he professing his grief and sorrow for his former wayes, whereunto he ws led by evill Counsell (of which we are bound to construct charitably, considering his age and educati∣on) The Estates of Parliament of this Kingdom, have thought it their duty to stre His Majesty to the exercise of His Royal Power: And if from a tender regard and conscience of the Oath and Covenant of God, we have been following our duty here∣in, and not for worldly Interests and designes, where is our of∣fence? or what reason or just grounds can bee given by these who are now upon our Borders for invading this Kingdome? None of His Majesties actions before His coming into this Kingdom can in the least sort be charged on us, unlesse they had been owned by us, and for the future, it shall be our care, that there may be no just ground of complaint. As for the blood and other sins which the Lord may put on the account of the KING, and that Family, we shall mourn before the Lord for it, and pray, that his wrath may be turned away, and that as the Lord hath now been pleased in his wise & gracious providence, to admit hi to enter in Covenant with Him and His People, so also that he would give him a new heart and spirit, so to guile him in all his wayes, as may be matter of rejoycing to all that fear the Lord, and may convince his greatest Adversaries, and stop their mouthes from reproaches. Themselves might be here
put in mind of that Scripture which saith; I will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu: But we take no delight in re∣criminations. To conclude, it hath been cleared, there is no just cause of their invading this Kingdom: For in the matter of the Engage∣ment against England, we blesse the Lord we are innocent; and for the testimony given by our Commissoners at London, and approven by the Parliament, it was necessary duty: Neither can there be any just pretence for the necessity of this War; all fair and amicable wayes have not been used. Wee have not refused to do them right. Wee had no designe to invade England; nor have wee given any other just ground of offence. Wherefore this War made without any just cause, necessity, or antecedent warning, is most unjust on their part, and most just on ours, be∣ing for our own lawfull and necessary defence Having answered their Declarations, we desire now to let the Kingdome know who are these that come thus in a hostile man∣ner against us, are not these the men who in their low Estate by their solemn professions, of intending nothing but the Refor∣mation, and defence of Religion, and the prosecution of unifor∣mity therein between the Churches, and unity between the King∣domes, the honour and happinesse of the King, and his posteri∣ty, and the Peace and safety of these dominions engaged us in a solemn League and Covenant with God, and with them, and by Treaties to joyn in a Warre for these ends in the year 1643. and now in place thereof have by their crafty counsells, under∣mining designes, and force of Armes obstructed and opposed the work of Reformaion, established a multiformity of Religi∣ons, destroyed the King and his family so farre as is in their power, overturned all Government Civill and Ecclesiasticall in England and Ireland, and cannot rest there, but have now resol∣ved to prosecute a war against this Kingdom also, unlesse as we did swear a Covenant with them, we will renounce and for∣swear
it, and the ends thereof? are not these the men who are a∣busers of the Ordinances of God in our neighbour land, tolera∣tors of errors, proclaimers of liberty, dispensers with Bands and Oathes in Gods matters, but rigid exactors and oppressors of persons, yea of Nations, in their Consciences, Liberties, and E∣states, in their own matters, and for their own ends, who have brought great scandall and reproach upon the name of God, the the name of his people, and the study of piety, and who have not only broken the solemn and sacred Covenant betwixt God and these Nations, but have in effect rejected it, and trampled upon it, are become enemies to all the ends thereof, and per∣secutors of the servants and people of God for their adhe∣rence to it; doe they not follow the wayes of the Prelaticall and malignant party, who in the beginning of these troubles came to invade this Kingdome, but blessed be the Lord returned with shame, are they not walking in the same paths, that the late Engagers did against England, sinning with an high hand against God, his Cause, Covenant, and People, the sin∣fulnesse of their wayes, meanes, Instruments, ends, and aymes, and the evident injustice of their quarrell against these who never gave them just ground of offence, make it appa∣rent. We assisted and relieved England twice since the begin∣ning of these troubles, and returned both times peaceably out of the Kingdome; Not only their own expressions, but their consciences can bear witnesse to our sufferings and opposition in reference to the late engagement, and will they requite us with War for our kind assistance? hostilitie for friendship, and render evill for good? Surely he seeth all these things, whose eyes run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to shew himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him, and can speak peace unto their helpers, and bring in the day of his vengeance, and the year of recompence, for the quarrell of his broken Covenant, upon these who have set up Thresholds by his Thresholds, and Posts by his Posts, and not onely do so themselves, but endeavour to compell and force others to do
the same, do they thus provoke the Lord to jealousie, are they stronger nor he? hath he not sworn by his great name, that his people shall knov whether his designes, or his enemies, his counsell or theirs, his word or theirs, his work or theirs shall stand? In the pride of their heart, because of former successes, and trusting to their Power, skill, and experience, they think to doe with Jerusalem as with Samaria, with Israel, as with Edom, and with the Covenanted people of God, as with Malignants, a∣gainst whom they were raised as a scourge and a rod of indignation, not considering that when the Lords work is done, and the axe boasteth it selfe against the hewer, then the Lord useth to send among their fat ones lean∣nesse, under their glory, to kindle a burning, and the light of Israel u∣seth to be for a fire, and his holy one for a flame to destroy the briars and thorns, in one day saith the Lord. If we shall keep malignancy out of our quarrell, and malignant Instruments out of our Counsels, and forces, and our selves free from every thing which may provoke the Lord, and doe eve∣ry duty that may engage them for us; the case of the Ammonites against Jepthah and Israel, the case of Jeroboam, against Abijah, the case of A∣maziah gainst Joash, the case of Zennacherib against Hezkiah, the case of Moab against Jehosaphat, and the judgments which came on these Inva∣ders; speak terrour to our Adversaries that come against us, and courage and comfort to the necessary defenders, for the Lord lives and reignes for ever, to confirm the word of his servants, and perform the counsell of his Messengers, and turneth the wisdom of the wise, and strength of the strong backward, maketh the Diviners mad, and the despisers to wonder and pe∣rish, for he will work a work which they shall in no wise beleeve, though a a man declare it unto them. Let us therefore arise and be doing for the Cause, and for the Cities of our God, and the Lord will be with us, and will not forsake us, if we forsake not him, And who then can be against us? He will be Jehovah Nissi, and spread a banner of love over His people, and send the angel of His presence among them for a sun and a shield, and will make Je∣rusalem a burdensome stone, a cup of trembling and a torch in a sheif to all that dare meddle with Sion, and break the staffes of beauty and bands, and he will soon go through the briars and thorns let in battell against him, for the Cause, and the battell is the Lords: Let us wait on His salvation. There is cause of humiliaton, when we consider our formality in the Worship of God, our neglect of duties, of true piety, our undervaluing of the precious Gospel, our unthankfulnes for mercies,
our stupidity under judgements, our manifold backslidings of heart, and sef-seeking our not minding as we ought the inward work of Reformation, & resting too much on the out side of duties, the profanes of many in the Land & in our Amy, and many other transgreshons. or these things we should lie low in the dust, and acknowledge that it were just with the Lord to leave us, to let our enemies prevail over us, and let in a flood∣gate of error, heresie, schisme and profanesse to overflow the Lan; But there is no cause of fear or fainting, if we will consider that the Lord delights to be called on, as a God who will keep Covenant and mercy to, and with his people, notwithstanding their failings, if we look either to the Lords former dispensations, or present engagements for his Work, and the honour of his great Name, or if we will look to the eemies quarrell, their aymes and designes, or to the resolutions of this Krk and Kingdom, to stand for the Cause and Covenant against enemies and dangers on all hands. If the Lord had intended to destroy the Land, he would not have done so much for us and amongst us, nor received a sa∣crifice off our hands; Though the enemy should come in like a flood to overflow Immanuels Land, His Spirit shall lift up a standard a∣gainst him, and not suffer His people to say a confederacy to such, but shall magnifie himself in the borders of Israel. Wherefore we desire all the people of the Land to beware that they be not deceived and insnared with the fair offers and smooth pretences of the Sectaries, whole words are soft as butter and oil, but gall and bitrernesse is in their hearts and actions; they have the smooth voyce of Jacob, but the rough hands of Esau. And we do in the name and by the warrant of the Estates of Par∣liament discharge all persons whatsoever within the Kingdom to give them aide, counsellor assistance, or to correspond or comply with them any manner of way, under the same paines and certifications that they are discarged to joyn, assist, correspond or comply with Malignants and Rebels in Arms.
