Ioseph Danyel reulers of realmes wer̄ of god chosen Iob zachee Ioseph of Aramathie we¦re fulle riche men / and nowe ben fulle high in blisse.

Therfore me thynketh alway that it is better to be rich thanne pore For pouerte & mys¦cheif drawe many a man to rob¦bery / manslaughter and lichery & other synnes many moo And therfore sayth Salomon Prop¦terinopiam multi deliquerunt: Ecclesiastes. xxviii.

Mendicitatem et diuicias ne de eris michi / ne egestate comp̄ss{us} {per}iurē nomen dei. Lorde he saith yeue me neither grete richesse ne beggery yt Ibe nat cōstreyned by nede to forswere my goddes na∣me / & holy chirche singith & saith Diuicias & pau{per}tates ne dedet m̄ Lord saith he yeue me no gret

The hole prayer of Salomon is this / Mendici∣tatem et diuicias ne dede ris mi¦chi Tribue tantum victui meo necessaria Ne forte saciatus il¦liciar ad negandum. et dicam quis est domin{us}. et egestate cō∣pulsus furer et periurem nom̄ dei mei.

After the exposicion of Bede / & Lyre. in this texte. Salomon prayeth to god that he be nat so fylled with richesses / that he for pride and aboundaūce of world¦ly godes foryet his god & endles godes / Also on that other syde that vnpacience of pouert com∣pelle him nat to stele / neither to forswere him. In whiche pray∣er he refusith no more pouertie / thanne he dothe aboundaunce. of richesse. But his prayer in dif¦ferently biholdith grete richesse / and moche pouertie. Also sir sauf thy pacience / thou rehersist the wordes of Salomones p̄yer with false englisshe and nat con¦uenyent. For he saide nat yeue me neither richesse ne beggerye. as thou saydest But he sayde ye¦ue me richesse and beggery. That is to saye / yeue me nat ri¦chesse with nygardshyp & strayt¦nesse of herte and couetyse / whi¦che make the riche man alway. to begge and craue. For as I saide. Ecclesiastes. the v. c. the nygard hath neuir enough And so by these wordes he prayeth to god that if he yeue him richesse. that he shuld gyue him therwith largenesse of hert / and grace to spende them to goddes worship and to haue gode of his gode by his lyf. For as he sayth Ecclesi¦astes vi. It is a greate myscheyf and a greate vanytye that god gyueth a man richesse. and godes ynough what he wol haue And with that he yeueth him no power fornygardship to
haue parte therof / But kepith theym to the straungere / whiche shal deuoure al that he gettyth. With moche care Ayen this mys∣cheyf and beggery of couetyse. Salomon made his prayer say¦enge to the lorde. yeue me nat ri¦chesse and beggerye to gyder. For suche nygarshyp: and beg∣gerye / makith riche men to for∣sake their god. So it is vn∣derstonde of beggery and pouer¦tie that cometh of myscouetyse / nat of pouertie and begery that comyth of nede and wantynge of gode For the riche mā nedith more to begge bodily thāne the pore. Diues. That is false. Pauper. I preue it. Dauyd ye worthy kynge sayde.

Whanne Crist badde him kepe the p̄ceptes in general he badde him kepe the x. cōmaū¦dementes & the ii p̄ceptes of cha¦ritye / & al goddes hestes & his la¦wes But he specifyed more the p̄ceptes of the secoūde table thā of the firste / & more the secoūde p̄cepte of charite than the firste. not yt he was more boūde therto but for he was more enclyned. bicause of youthe / of richesses / & of lordship / to forfet ayenst tho p̄ceptes than ayenst the other of the firste table For youthe is en¦clyned to wrathe / hastynesse. fi∣ghtyng / and so to māslaughter to lichery / auoutrye / to lyenge / & so to false wytnesse / to theft / to pryde & rebellion / to īdignacion to dispyte of his elder / And so in many wyse offendith his neigh¦boure & his euyn cristen And na¦mely whan youthe is vndersett̄ with riches / & is at his owne rule withoute drede of punysshinge. as that yonge man was. For he was fulle ryche / and he was a prynce leder and ruler of the cuntre. as saythe Seint Lu¦ke. in his gospelle. And therfore Criste moste souerayn leche. not only taught him how
he shulde lyue withouten ende. but more ouir he warned him to what seknesse he was moost dis∣posed to / wherby he myghte lese that lyf and die withouten ende & taught him medicynes ayenst tho seknesses / whan he bad him nat sle / do no lichery / no thefte. bere no false witnesse / worshyp fadre and modre / and in his reu¦lyng loue his neighbour as him self / and doo to him as he wolde men dyde to him. Diues. Why specified nat criste to him the ii. laste p̄ceptes of the secounde ta∣ble whiche be ayenst fals coueti¦se. Pauper. For yonge folk be be nat so moche enclyned to co∣uetise as they be to other synnes Diues. That is sothe / for coue¦tyse reigneth moost in olde folk And so as men wexe in age / soo encresith ther couetise And whā al other synnes forsake mā for elde and feblenesse / than couety¦se is moost breme Pryde is first i youthe / couetyse laste in age Saye forth what thou wylt. Pauper Euirmore thou shalt vndrestonde yt ther be ii. manere of lyues by the which man may be sauyd The firste is cōtempla¦tyf / the secounde is actyf. The first stondith principally in besi¦nesse to knowe god and goddes lawes / & to loue him aboue alle thinge. The secounde stondith principaly in gode dedes & gode reule / and helpe of our euyn cri∣stē The thre first p̄ceptes of the first table belongith to alle / but principaly to them that been in lyf contemplatyf that haue for∣sake the worlde and worldly be¦synesse for the loue of god. The vii. p̄ceptes of the secounde ta∣ble also longen to alle / but prin¦cipally to theym that ben in lyf actyf & in besynesse of the world The lyf contemplatif is in ease & rest of hert. The lyf actyf is in doynge & trauayl and besynesse of body & soule And of this lyf spake ye yonge riche man whāne he seyd. Lorde what shal I do. how shal I lyue to haue the lyf withoutē ende And crist taught hī what gode dedes he shuld do what mysdedes he shulde fle / if he wolde kepe wele the lyf actyf Also thou shalt vnderstonde for this speche of crist and many su¦che other / that criste ī the gospel & hole wrytte by example of the lesse preueth & shewith the more As whanne he saith yt men shuld be sauyd at the day of dome for they yaue mete to the hungrye. drynke to the thrusty / moche mo¦re than shuld ther be aued yt yaf al that they hadde or myght ha¦ue for the loue of god. and hem self to serue god night and daie. body and soule / and put them to
the dethe for his loue. And they also that fede mannys soule wt brede of goddes worde And sith they shalbe dāpned yt wole natt yeue to pore folke mete & drynk for goddes sake / Moche more shuld they be dāpned that robbe men of ther lyf & lyuelode. & they that done lechery / auoutrye / mā¦slaughter / robbery / and other or¦rible synnes. And on the same maner whanne cryste specifyed to that riche man / the preceptes of the secounde table / and the se¦counde precepte of charitye / He shewith that sithen tho were soo necessary to haue the lyf withou¦ten ende / Moche more the p̄cep¦tes of the first table and the first p̄cept of charite been necessarye to alle that wole haue the lyf wt outen ende. Diues. Therfore wolde I fayne kepe theym bet∣ter thanne I haue done. But I se many doubtes therin ye I can nat kepe theym. Pau{per}. What doute haste thou therin. The firste chaptre. DIues. In the firste commaūdement as I haue lernyd / god sayth thus. Thou shalt haue no on other straunge goddes bifore me.

Exodi xx.c. Soo by this me thinketh ye god defendeth makynge of ymages and worshippynge of them / and yit men do make ymages / these daies grete plente / bothe in chur¦che and out of churche And alle men as me thynk worshyp yma¦ges: And it is fulle harde to me but I do in that as al men done And if I worshyp them me thin¦keth I do ydolatrie ayenst god∣des lawe. Pauper. God forbe¦dith nat men to make ymages / For he bad moyses make yma∣ges of ii. aūgelys / that be clepyd cherubyn. in the lyknesse of two yonge men / as we fynd Exodi. xxxvii.c. And salomon made suche and many mo therto ī the temple / to the worshyp of god. the iii. boke of kingis vii.c. And god bad moyses make his taber¦nacle & al that longith therto / af¦tre the example and the lyknes. yt was shewyde to him vpon the hylle / whanne he was there with god xl. daies & xl. nightes. Ex¦odi. xxv. And therfore god for∣bedith nat vtterly the makynge
of ymages / but he forbedith vt∣terly for to make ymages for to worship them as goddes / and to sette their faith / their trust / their hope their loue / & their bileue in them For god wole haue man∣nys herte hole knytt to him alo∣ne / for in him is al oure help & al oure saluacion And therfore we muste worshyp him & loue him / & truste in him aboue al thynge. & no thynge worship but him or for him. That alle the worshyp that we do to any creature be do principaly for him. & arectyd to him. For he sayth. Gliam me¦am alteri non dabo / et laudem meam sculptilibus / ysaie xlii. I shal nat yeue my worshippe / my blisse / my glorye / to none o∣ther / ne my prysynge to grauyn ymages / ne to paynted ymages And in the same chaptre he saith Shamfully shent mote they be alle that set their truste ī grauen ymages. Diues. Wher∣of serue these ymages / I wolde they were brent alle / Pauper. They serue for thre. thynges / For they be ordeined to stere mā¦nys mynde to thynke on cristes incarnacion / and on his passion & on his lyuynge / & on other sein¦tes lyuynge Also they ben ordei¦ned to styre mannys affection. and hi herte to deuocion For ofte man is more steryd by sight than be herynge or redynge / Al∣so they be ordeyned to be a tokē & a boke to the leude peple / that they may rede ī ymagery & pain¦ture / that clerkes rede ī the boke as the lawe sayth. de cōsecra. dis¦tinct .iii. {per} latū.

Take hede how naked & pore he henge vpon the crosse / for thy synne & thy sake / and be thou nat ashamyd to suffre po∣uertie & myscheif for his loue. And as seynt Bernarde byddith take hede by the ymage how his hede is bowed downe to the redy to kysse the and come at one wt the / See how his armys and his hondes been spradde abrode on the tree / in token that he is redy to halse and clyppe the / & kysse the / and take the to his mercye.

seruice longith only to god And on this maner seruyce spekyth Criste whanne he sayth tho wor¦des Dominum deum tuum. &c. Thou shalte worshyp thy lorde god and serue him alone with di¦uyne seruyce / and dyuyne wor∣shyp. that is to say. Thou shalt do no Latriam. no diuyne wor¦shyp ne diuyne seruyce to no cre¦ature. but only to god / And ther¦fore who so doth any diuyne ser¦uyce that is clepyd Latria. to a∣ny creature to any ymage. or a∣ny fourme or figure. he doth ydo¦latry.

What clepist thou propirly latriam. di¦uyne worshyp and seruyce that longith only to god Pau{per}. As sayth a grete clerke Antisidoren¦sis in summa sua. libro tercio.

Thou shalt yelde thyn othes to thy lorde god & to no creature Also it is done by vo¦wes makynge For it is nat lee∣ful to make a vowe to any crea¦ture And therfore he sayth Red∣des dn̄o vota tua. Thou shalte yelde thyne a vowes to thy lord god. and to no creature. And the prophete saythe / Vouete et reddite domino deo vestro. Make ye vowes / and yelde ye youre vowes to youre lord god
nat to the ymagis stockes ne sto¦nes Also it is done with prayer. & prisynge of the mouth For we muste praye him and pryse him as souerayne might / souerayne wysdome / souerayne godenesse souerayne treuthe / as alle right¦fulle and merciful. as shapper & sauer of alle thing / & lorde of al & souerayne helpe in euery nede. And on this maner may we nat praye ne prise any creature And therfore they yt make their pray∣ers and ther prisinges bifore the ymages / & say their Pater nost. their Aue maria / and other pray¦ers & prisynges / vsed comōly of holy churche / or any suche other if they do it to the ymage / & spe∣ke to the ymage / they doo open ydolatrye And they be nat excu¦syd alle if they vnderstonde nat what they saye.

The xii. chaptre ALso this {pro}testacion and knowlechyng is done by dede / as by offrynge / & sacrifice makynge whiche longe only to god. For what man offreth or maketh sacrifice / he knoulegith him yeuer of grace. & maker of holynesse / sauyour & foryeur of synne / & this may no creature do Also it is shewyd by tokenys of the body / as by kneling loutyng lyftynge vp of hondes / by bun∣chynge of the brest / whiche toke¦nys may be do bothe to god and to resonable creatures / but other¦wise to god than to resonable cre¦atures. For as saith a clerke Ri¦cardus de media villa su{per} terciū sentenci. dist. i qōne vltima whāne we knele to god / in yt we knowlege that we may nat stō∣de in vertue / in godenesse / ne in wele but only by him / whāne we fal al downe to grounde to god we knowlege that but he helde vs & kept vs / we shulde falle al to noughte And whāne we hold vp oure hōdes to hym. We knou¦lege that we may right noughte do withouten hym / & that we be al in his power / and that he may do withouten vs what he wole / & so we put vs only in his grace Also by that we knoulege. that al that we haue of any godenes we take it of his honde / and of his yifte. Whanne we bunche oure breestys / we knowlege vs gyltye ayenste him in herte / and in dede. And that we haue done.
moche synne / whiche only god knowith For only he knowyth mannys herte and mānes wylle Also we bunche oure self on the breest in token of sorowe of hert for oure mysdedys / and that we repente vs sore of our mysdedes These toknes of reuerēce be do also to reasonable creatures / as to aūgel / man & womā / but nat in this maner: For whanne we knele or loute. or fal downe to grounde / or holde vp oure hon∣des to any creature / we knoule¦ge that ther is some souereinte & some vertue in him that we kne¦le to / wherbye he may helpe vs. nat as principal helper / but as secundary with the helpe of god And therfore these dedys of wor¦shyp and reuerence shuld not be done to ymages / stockes / or sto¦nes / ne to none suche other For they haue no suche vertue ne so¦ueraynte aboue man ne womā. ne right nought may helpe them at nede / ne themself neither So that these dedys of reuerence prī¦cipally ought to be done to god. secundary to aūgel man or wo¦man / but on no wise to noon o∣ther vnreasonable creatures / ne to none suche ymages And as sayth a grete clerke. Doctor ha¦lis in summa sua. To god men shulde knele with bothe the kne¦es / in token that in him is al our principalle help / but to man on¦ly with the one knee. Soo leue frende ye shal vnderstonde that the worshyp which is clepid La¦tria. shalbe done only to god. The worship that is clepid Du¦lia. is comon bothe to god & mā For we shulde worship man wo¦man and aungel. nat for theim self / but principally for god / for that they ben made to goddes y∣mage For they be goddes seruā¦tes and goddes mynistres.

And alle though he be nowe wycked / we woote neuir howe sone he shal amende hym. and be oure brother in blysse. as saith seint Austyn vpon the sau¦ter But to the fende shuld we do no worshyp / for he is dampned withouten ende / and ther is no hope of his saluacion. The xiii. chaptre WE shulde worship man & woman / for he is made to the lyknesse of god / for his offi∣ce / for the worshyp of god / & dis¦pyse his syn And therfore sayth seynt petre. Omnes honorate. Worshyp ye alle men and wymē Honore inuicem preuenientes. Be ye besy / who soo may euery

Couetyse of men of holy churche and leude∣nesse bothe of theym and of the people ben cause of suche ydola¦trye. Diues. I haue herde say that many grete clerkes holden therwith / & say that men shulde worshyppe ymages Pau{per}. Worshippe is a large word and comon to diuyne worshyp. and seruyce that is clepyde Latria. and to worshype that is clepyd Dulia. Whiche longith propir∣ly to speke only to resonable cre¦ature For as sayth the philoso∣phre. quarto ethico{rum}. Worshyp is mede of vertue And it owith nat to be done to any creature. but that creature haue some go¦denes of vertue moral / & of gra¦ce / or elles some office to lede & brynge folke to moralle vertue Diues. Thanne to the ymage stocke or stone / golde or syluer / longith none suche worshyppe For whāne it is so sere and dry. & worme eten / it hath no vertue at alle / but for to brenne soner ī the fyre than a grene tree But whanne it wext vpon the erthe. it hadde vertue to wex & spring & to brynge forth grene leuys & floures to conforte of mannys iye & frute. to helpe of man and beest And yit wole no man wor¦ship suche grene trees ne p̄cious stones ne erbys alle if they haf grete vertues and woūderfulle for they haue no vertue moral. ¶Moche more men shulde nat worshyppe sere drye trees / that haue no vertue at alle / Say forthe what thou wilte. Pauper· Also worshyp is cle∣pyd veneracion that stondith ī honest & siker kepynge / honeste handlynge / clene dightynge / in stondyng / in syttynge / in place settyng And this maner of wor¦shyp may be done & ought to be done to euery holy thynge yt lon¦gith to god. and holy church as boke chalyce vestment / belles & ymages. in asmoche as they be ournamentes of holy churche / and the lewde mennys boke. But this worshyp and venera∣ciō is no seruice ne subiection of hī yt doth it to the thyng yt he doth it to / but it she wyth subiection / & seruyce of the thinges so wor∣shypyd to him that putteth it so in worshyp. so kepith it & so sa∣uyth it And on this maner the lawe clepith ymages venerable & worshypful / for ther shuld no man dispyse them ne defoul bē. brenne them ne breke them De consecrac. di / iii.

But they take that dulia. fulle largely / & fulle vnpropirly / For such wor¦shyp & veneracion / is no seruice ne subiection as I saide bifore.

Thurification. & encensyng was by olde tyme an high diuyne worshyp. And many seyntes were putt to the deth for they wolde nat en∣cense ymages stockes ne stones But nowe clerkes encense yma¦ges & other / preestes & clerkes & lewde people also.

In euery lawe thurificaciō & encensyng hath been an highe dyuyne worship. yt ought nat to be done to any creature by wey of offrynge Neuirtheles it may be done on ii / maners.

For by the encensour is vnderstonde man∣nys herte / by the encēse holy py¦er / by the fyre charitie And so su¦che encensyng and thurificaciō betokneth that right as the p̄ste offrith vp in the encensoure en∣cense. swete smellyng by hete of the fyre So the preest & the peo∣ple by the preest offre vp her her¦tes to god and her prayers quyc¦ned by the fyre of charite.

For alle the masse syngyng is a special myn¦de makynge of cristes passion / And right as Cryst was meane in his passion bitwene god and mankynde / so is the preest ī his messe saynge / and sacrifice ma∣kynge and offrynge and encen∣synge / meane bitwene god and the people. And therfore only a preest shulde encense at the au∣tre / and with halowed encense / and with holy prayer sayng on this wyse for him selfe & for the people. Dirigatur oratio mea sicut incensū in conspectu tuo. Lorde make my praier go right vp in thy sighte as encense Also thurificacion may be done only for steryng to deuocion & for to kenynge And so it may be done to the clergie and to the people. in token that as the encense by hete of the fyre smellith swete / & styeth vp to heuen warde / Soo shulde they lyft vp their hertes / with deuocion / and make their prayers in charite yt they mighte be plesaunte to god / and wende vp to god. For but the preest and the peple be in charite / elles their prayer pleasith nat god / ne gothe nat vp to god as it shuld elles do. & therfore is no mā wor¦thy to be encensed but if he be in charite And whan the clergye in the quere or the people is encen∣sed / they shulde lowte lowe / for reuerēce of god / and take it nat as for worshyp done hem but as sterynge to deuocion / & as a to∣ken / what deuocion they shuld shewe to god / & by loutyng she∣we lownesse of deuocion that it sterith them to For withoute de¦uocion and lownesse of hert our prayer goth nat vp to god But as saith the wiseman The pray¦er of him that loweth him in his prayer thirlith the cloudes The myssalle and the gospel is encē∣sed in token that the praiers wri¦ten therin profit litel or nought but if they be made with deuoci¦on and ī charitie And ther shuld no man preche the gospel. butt with deuocion and for charitye & alle his spede and alle his pro∣fytte referre vp to god / and alle his prayers put in his wylle At buriynge men encense the dede bodies / in token that he dyed in charitye. & in his dyenge he had his hert vp to god / by hope feith charite & deuocion / for elles he is nat worthy to be buryed in cri¦sten buryelles.

And he hath leuyr hym selue to be holden a wytche and the de∣uylles seruaunte: thanne to be

And so lightly the feend might appe∣re to him that were alyue in the lyknesse of him that were / dede. and telle hym lesynges / and in case make him so aferyd that he shulde lese his wytte / and falle ī wanbileue / as felle to one with in a fewe yeres.

And so bothe he yt chargith hym to come ayen / and he yt hotith to come ayen tempten god. And right as god wol that euery mā and woman be vncerteyn what tyme he shal dye / for that alway he shuld be dredeful to do amys and besy to do wele Right so he wole that men be vncerteyn of their frēdes whan they ben dede in what state that they been / for that they shulde alway be besy. to helpe ther soules with messes syngynge. almes doynge / with bedys byddyng / and other gode dedes nat only for help of hī but of other that haue lytel helpe or none Also for encresyng of their owne mede For who so trauay∣leth wel for a nother trauaylith beste for him self For as saythe seynt poule. ther shal noo gode dede be vnyoldē / ne no wyckyd dede be vnpunysshed.

Is it lefulle to sett any trust or any feyth on dremys Pauper. Ther been ii. maner causes of dremys / Done from inward / a nother from out¦warde Causes of dremes from inwarde ben thre maner: Done is comon stirynge of mannes fā¦tasye. or womans in their slepe. and suche dremys ben but fanta¦sye & vanyte And therfore saith Salomon Vbi multa somnia: ibi multe vanitates. eccle. v.c. Where been many dremys there ben many vanyties / for on this maner one man shal haue moo dremys than sūme tuenty other A nother cause from inwarde is disposicion of the body. For whanne men ben colde of kynd. they dreme of frostes and snow. And so by their dremys a wyse
leche may knowe in party dispo¦sicion of her body / be it to helthe or to sekenes The thridde cause from inwarde is. disposicion of the soule For comonly men dre∣men of suche thinges as her soul and their thought is moost occu¦pied in while they waken / either by studye / by loue / or by hate / by wrathe / by drede / by sorowe / by care pride or couetise Causes of dremys from outwarde ben two maner / bodily and gostly Bodi¦ly is the disposicion of the ayre. and of the place about him / and other thinges beside him. And therfore in rayne wedyr mē dre∣me of water and of fisshes. For ofte mannys body chaūgith af∣ter the disposicion of the ayre / & of his abidynge place And for these thre causes sayth the philo¦sopher. De somno et vigilia. That leches shuld take hede to the dremys of them yt been seke. to knowe therby how they been disposed. Gostly causes from outwarde of dremys been ii. ma¦ners. The one cause is gode / for that is god by him self. Or elles by aungelles / and that on three maner For some suche dreme by ymaginacion only / as dyde the kinge pharo and nabugodono∣sor.

And so as saye clerkes in asmo∣che as dremys come by waye of kynde / in so moche it is leful to telle what they signifie after the causes that they come of Soo that in their tellinge and coniec¦tynge they passe nat the boūdes of kynde. Also it is leful to telle thinges that been to come. by dremys that come by reuela∣cion of god / if man and womā. haue grace to vnderstonde them as Ioseph and danyel hadde.

If it be so saith he yt any man emōges you begyn to be a sothe sayer & a {pro}phete and say that he had a dre¦me and a vision / and telle anye wounder / whiche wounder and token fallith as he saythe / if he stire the to mawmetry or to any wytchecrafte / here nat the wor∣des of that prophete and of that dremer. For by him god assaieth you / that it may be openly kno∣wen whether ye loue him wt alle your herte and soule or nay And therfore god byddeth that suche dremers and prohetes shulde be slayn & though he wēt thy owne broder by fader & by moder thou shuldest nat spare him in ye caas. And therfore Salomon saythe that dremys haue brought mo∣che folke in erroure and in foly. and they that truste therin falle to nought. Ecclesi. xxxiiii.c. For alle if dremys come oft ty∣mes by wey of kynde as I said yit it is ful harde to knowe whā it cmeth / by wey of kynd or by illusion of the feed And though they come by wey of kynde and though a mā knowe the causes ī kynd of dremes / yit it ful harde to telle sothly what shal fal ther¦of. For only god knowythe for certayn thinges that been to co∣me / and he may chaūge and lett the worchynge of kynde And also though men knowe the cau¦ses of kynde that dremes come of / yit knowe they nat what let¦tynges ben on other bihalue / by way of kynde.

That god badde that in nombrynge of the people euery mā shulde pay to his tabernacle half a sicle / that was fyue pēs. and that the riche shuld yeue no more as for thanne. ne the pore no lesse In token that riche and pore shulde be besy to worshyp. & to meintene goddes house and goddes seruyce. God bad that both the riche & pore shulde pay alyke / in tokē that the pore mā shulde holde hym self as moche boūde to god as shulde the riche

And therfore leeue freend thou muste take hede to the tyme and other circumstan∣ces.

In tho wordes Cryste techyth vs nat oonly where we shulde praye / but he techyth vs howe we shuld pray For the chā¦bre that we shuld entre in is our herte / for in our prayer we shuld gadre our inwyttes & oure thou¦ghtes to gyddre in oure herte / & sette oure herte only in god and take hede to oure prayer. The dore that we shulde shytte been oure v. Wyttes outwarde to flee distraction. For thāne we shuld kepe wele oure sight our heryng oure felynge / oure tastynge and semellynge. that ther come noo distraction into oure herte by a∣ny of oure fyue wyttes. And he badde alsoo in the same place / that men in theire prayer shulde fle ypocrisye. and vayne glorie. And to flee alle this it is
fulle spedefulle to man and wo¦man whanne they may nat goo to churche / to go to their cham∣bre / and into their oratory. and saye there theire prayere and de∣uociones But if they dispyse goddes house & leue goddes ser∣uyce for such pryue prayer / they synne greuously / and lese mede of their priuey prayer And ther∣fore the lawe byddyth that they that haf pryue oratories or cha∣pelles by leue of the busshop. to here in their masse and their ser∣uyce / that in the greate festes as Ester. Cristmasse / epiphany / as¦cencton / penticoste / seynt Iohn baptyst & other such / they shuld go to church. and no prest shuld thanne synge in suche oratories or chapelles withouten speciall leue of the busshop / and if he did he shulde be put from his masse. De consecrac. distinc. i. si quis. extra. Bothe pryue prayer and open been gode if they be doone in due maner. and in due place. and in due tyme Prayer is gode in chambre and in oratory / but it is better in holy churche wyth the comunyte / whan tyme is of comon prayer / and whanne mē may wele attende therto wt fer∣uēt charite Synguler prayer of one {per}sone is gode in chambre / & in oratorie and better in church. With euē charite. But comon prayer of a comunyte ī churche is bettee thanne a singuler pray¦er if euery partie of that comu∣nytie be in charite For Criste sayth in the gospel / that if ii. or thre be gadryd to gider in his na¦me that is charite / there is he in the myddes of theym / that is to say in their hertes to helpe them in their prayer. And if ii. of you sayth he consent to gider by cha¦rite ī her prayer / what euyr they axe it shalbe doo to theym Mt. xviii. And therfore sayth seynt ambrose. su{per} illud ad Ro. xvi. adiuuetis me in orationibus ve¦stris. That whanne many sma¦le been gadryd to gidre they ben fulle grete And it is nat possible that the prayers of moche folke in charite shulde nat spede. And therfore sayth the prophete Ioel iio.c. Halowe ye your fastynge. clepe ye cumpany to you / gadre ye the peple to gydre And whan ye be gadryd make ye you holy & clene of synne / take ye the old folke wt you & gadre ye to gider the yong children souking al to prayer For right as a voice of a multitude is myghtier & ferther may be herde / than the voyce of one {per}sone alone / so is the voyce & p̄yer of a multitude soner herd thā is the voyce of one {per}sone al one & soner getith grace. & therfo¦re the {pro}phet saith Laudate d.o.

Pauper. Al if they may nat come to gyder in one place / ne in one churche / yit they must cūme to gyder in charite / that ye multitude of cristen peple be of one herte and of one loue and of one feyth. The lv chapter. DIues We make many ga¦drynges to gidre many ge¦neral {pro}cessiones and prayers in comon to pray for the pees / and yit haue we noo peas / but euery yere more warre thanne other & euery yere spede worse thā other Pauper. If men came to gidre and made their prayers in low∣nes / clenesse & charite. god shuld here them For he sayth if ii. or iii consent to gydre in charite what they axe to the worship of god. & to helpe of their soules it shall be done to hem of my fader But oure prayers and processions be ayenst charite / made with grete pryde For al yf men go on pro∣cession for the peas / and synge & say with their mouthe Da pacē domine. Lord yeue vs pees / yit with hert men praye alle ayenst peas. For they wolde noo peas haue / ne desire peas / but alway to haue werre and to shede cristē mennys blode For nat withstō∣dynge alle the myscheif that the peple is in bicause of werre / and that we haue the worse on euery syde / yit the peple saythe that it is beter to haue werre than pees & they haue leuyr to here of wer than of peas. And they say that they may natt lyue withouten werre And whanne god sent hē worshipfulle peas on euery side they dispysed pees / and slewe hē that made peas for that they tra¦ueyled to make peas. And the peple had leuyr pay grete taxes for shedynge of mānes bloode / thanne for to paye smalle taxes for to haue peas. And sithe they loue no peas / ne desire peas and wole nat haue peas though god wolde yeue theym pees withou∣ten doubte they pray nat for ye
peas For no man prayeth for a thynge that he wole nat haue And so in their prayers and {pro}ces¦siones they scorne god / & more {pro}¦uoke him to vengeaunce thāne to mercy Also they make their prayer nat with lownes / but wt grete pride / for they wole nat be knowe of any myscheyf. They holde them selue so stronge and so wyse that as them thynketh. they haue no nede of helpe. And therfore though god here vs nat in oure prayer / ne helpe vs it is no wounder. For with oure mouth we axe peas / but wt oure hert we axe werre / wt our mouth we say Kyrieleyson. Lorde. haue mercy on vs / but with our herte we praye him to helpe vs. to sle our euen cristen that wold lyue in peas And so oure prayer is alle oute of charite / and oure lyuynge is fulle synful. and ful highly ayenste the plesaunce of god. The lvi. chapter. DIues. It is a comon pro¦uerbe. that a shorte pray∣er thyrleth heuene. Oratio bre∣uis penetrat celū. And therfore sayth Cryste in the gospel: Mt. vi.c. Orantes nolite multū lo∣qui. Whanne ye praye sayth he. nyl ye speke moche. Pauper. It is a comon prouerbe of truā¦tes that sone be wery of prayers and haue more haste to tauerne thanne to holy churche and ha∣ue more lykynge in the worlde. than in god Natheles if it be wel vnderstonde / the {pro}uerbe is soth gode and holy For euery thyng is clepyd shorte. Whan the endes been nigh to gyder. And the fer∣ther that the endes of any thyng is atwynne / the lēger is the thīg And so it farith by prayer For the one ende of our prayer is our herte / and the other ende is god. And therfore sayth seynt austyn that prayer is a styenge vp of a mannys herte to god And on this maner the nigher that a mā¦nes herte is to god in his prayer. by loue and lownesse and deuo¦cion and right intēcion / the shor¦ter is his prayer And this maner of prayer thirleth heuene / for as holy wrytte sayth. the prayer of him that loweth him in his pray¦er. thirleth the skyes or the clou∣des. For the more that man lo∣weth him in his prayer. the more he nighyth to god / for than god of his mercy bowythe downe to him And therfore Crist saith yt he that so lowyth him self in his p̄y¦er he shalbe highed vp to god. And therfore seynt Iames saith ye god withondith the proude. & to the lowe and meke of herte he
yeueth grace And on this maner speke a man neuir so moche / as longe as his hert is nygh to god by loue and lownesse / and right intencion and deuocion / so lōge his prayer is but shorte. though he speke neuir somoche with his mouthe And as long as he may contynue his prayer so in deuo∣cion / it is leful and medeful / to speke in his prayer. But whāne his speche begynnyth to let him of his deuocion it is gode to cese of his vocal prayer / that is ī his owne free wyl But if he be boū¦den therto by a vowe or confessi¦on or by ordre / or by office / than he must saye his bedys that he is bounde to and do his dette And he must say distincly / nat to yer¦ne ne to atrete. For if he say to yerne he may lightly ouirskyp. And if he saye to atrete / he may falle into grete distraction & lose moch tyme. and leue therby ma¦ny gode dedys that he might el∣les do / and brynge him self in lo¦thynge of prayer and lettyng of deuocion of him self / and of the people also / that wolde here his prayer and his office. The lvii. chaptre. DIues. Why badde thanne Cryst that men shuld nat speke moche in their prayer. Pauper. Cryst had nat vtterly yt mē shulde nat speke moche in their prayer / but he had that mē shulde nat speke moche in their prayer as hethen men do. For they wene that god shulde natt here them but if they spake mo∣che. Also he badde vs nat speke moche in oure prayer as ypocri∣tes done. to be holden holy & soo gette mennys gode For as crist sayth ī the gospel. Luce xxiii.c. Suche deuoure wydowes hou∣ses by feynynge of longe prayer For as the glose saith ther̄ / they praye lenger thanne other / to be holden more religiouse and ho∣lyer thanne other. And therfore their prayer turneth into synne. ī somoche that they may neither wele praye for themself ne for o∣ther. And for suche prayer. they shal the more be dampned. as cryste sayth in the same place Mar. vii.c. This people wor∣shyp me wt their lyppes / but her herte is ful ferre fro me For god is in heuene / and their herte and thought al in erthe It is a comō prouerbe / that who so spekythe vnwysely and veynely / or in e∣uyl maner / he spekyth to moche And therfore as longe as a man or woman prayeth wysely. de∣uoutly and with gode ītencion. so longe he spekyth nat to moch But if he praye vnwysely wyth
pryde and wycked intēcion / he spekyth to moche though he spe¦ke neuir so lytle And therfore ye pharise spake to moche in his p̄y¦er / for he spake alle with pryde. And petir spake to moche / for he spake vnwysely / & therfore crist repreuyd them bothe. Also they speke to moche in their prayer. that sett their hert and feyth mo∣re in sownynge and sayng of ye wordes. than they do in god. or in the thynge that they pray for and say ayen and ofte ayen we∣nynge that god herde them uatt¦tyl whanne by suche iteracions they been wery / and leue many deuociones that they shuld saye And therfore sayth the wyse man / Non iteres verbū in orōe tua. Eccle. vii. Sey no worde ayen in thy prayer For suche doubte is lettynge of deuocion. for suche speke ouir moche / and make their prayer in wanbileue For if mannes herte be to god ward. god herith his praier lōge or he speke it with his mouth. Diues. Sithen god is ouir all present / why pray we more ī ho¦ly churche than in other place. Pauper. For asmoche as he is ouir al / therfore ī euery place he owyth to be worshiped But for asmoch as we may nat worship him in due maner in euery place Therfore is holy churche ordey¦ned that men shulde fulfyl there ye they leue in other places. And therfore in euery lawe god hath ordeyned certeyne places of pra¦yer where he wolde be worshiped in / passynge other places / and yt for many skylles. Firste for co∣mon prayer and prisynge is mo¦re plesaunte as I saide firste Al¦so to fle erroures and ydolatrye For if eche man or womā drewe him alone alway in his prayer. the feende shulde disseyue hym. by illusions and by iapes / as he dothe comonly them that fle cū∣pany. and loue to be moche so∣litary. Also for to exclude slouth in goddes seruyce / yt man and woman shulde falle in For but they were boūde to come to gider in some certayne place. to worship her god and to here god¦des lawe / they wolde elles trou¦ant. and worshyp god ī no place but ful selden And they wold ex¦cuse theym by vncūnyng if they dyd amys. Also holy churche is ordeyned for comon prayer and goddes seruyce that eche man & woman may bere wytnes of o∣ther at the day of dome / ayenste the feend / that he dyd in that as a cristen man ought to doo and seruyd his god.

More ouer leue frende ye shalle vnder¦stonde / that ther is ii. maner of prayer / one is comon. another is singuler Comon prayer is the prayer of the ministres of hooly churche and of comon persones. in holy churche / whiche prayer. they make in the name of al the peple. And this maner of prayer must be done by mouth / that ye peple may knowe that they p̄ye for them And therfore it is ordey¦ned by the lawe that suche pray¦er shuld be sayde / and sumtyme sunge openly with highe voyce. that the people may here it But singuler prayer that is done but of one singuler persone / may be done with herte alone withoutē voyce of the mouthe Nathelesse sumtyme it is gode to him thatt prayeth to praye by mouth And that for many skylles / Firste to excite his herte to more deuociō by outwarde tokenes And ther∣fore as longe as man or womā. is stired to deuocion by speche or vocal prayer. by knelynge / lou¦tynge fastynge / or any other ob¦seruaunce reasonable / so longe it is wele doone to vse it. in his

That anne spake in herte to god with bytter terys / and yitt ther herde no man her voice Also mē pray with the voice of the mouthe in yeldynge of dette For man is bounden to serue god with eue∣ry might and vertue yt god hath youen him / wt hert worde werk with al his might with alle his wytte And therfore holy church syngith and saythe. Os lingua niens sensus vigor confessionē {per}sonent. Mouth tunge wytte & mighte / make knowlechynge & praisynge to god And on this maner bedys biddynge is partie of satisfaction for synne. Also men pray wt voyce of the mouy for greate deuocion yt is īwarde in herte whiche brekith oute by speche of the mouthe / as saythe Criste in the gospel. Luce vi.

Whiche had done hem so moche worship & done so many woūderful cur̄s amonges theym. The lxii. chapter. DIues. I trowe that if mē were nowe as holy as mē were thanne / they shulde do my¦racles nowe as they dyd thanne Pauper Though they were as holy or holier they shulde nat do suche myracles For they be nat nowe so nedefulle as they were thanne / ne it were nat {pro}fitable to the people. as I sayde righte nowe And I hope that they ben as holy that do no myracles as many of theim yt done miracles. For suche doynge of myracles. stondith nat in the holynesse of him that dothe the miracle / but it stondith in the clepynge. & the vertue of goddes name to the {pro}¦fytte of other / and ofte to damp¦natiō of him that so clepith god¦des name and doth the myracle As saith the glose. su{per} illud Mt viio Dn̄e nōne in noīe tuo {pro}phe¦tauimus. Diues. It semyth therby that shrewis and wycked lyuers may do miracles Pau{per} Criste saith so himself Mt. vii.c For as we rede there. at the doo¦me many that shalbe dampned. shal say to Criste O lorde we {pro}¦phecyed in thy name and castyd out feendes and dyd many tok¦nes and myracles in thy name. But he shalle say ayen to them. Wendyth hense fro me ye wor∣chers of wyckednesse. I knowe you nat for none of myne. And as sayth seynt Iohn Crisostom in tractatu. Nemo leditur nisi a semetipso.
That Iudas the traitoure had power of god for to do and dyde many greate miracles / yit is he dampned Also doynge of mira∣cles is no syker tokene of gode∣nesse neither of the doer ne of pe∣ple there that they ben done / but only charitie and gode liuynge been syker token of godenesse And therfore Criste taughte vs to know the gode {pro}phetes from the wycked. nat by her miracles ne by their prophecy / but by her gode dedys and charite Therby saith he men shal knowe that ye be my disciples if ye haue chari∣te amōges you / nat by miracles ne by prophecy For iudas dyde miracles / and cayphas and ba∣laam fulle cursed wreches. pro∣phecyed fulle truly And seynt Iohn baptiste that was so holy dyd neuir suche miracles by his lyf And therfore Cryste badde yt we shulde take hede to mennys dedys and knowe them by their fruyt. Diues. Ipocrites and he¦retikes do ful many gode dedys and yit be they shrewys Pau{per}. Suche maner of folke haue ii. maner of dedys / one in priuey. another in apert or open. Their dedis in a{per}t be nat theirs but they ben clothinges of shepe vnder whiche they hile theim or couer them as wolues to dissey∣ue gode shepe And therfore crist byddith in the gospel yt we shuld be ware of false prophetes. that yt come to vs in clothynge of she¦pe / for they ben inwarde wolues of raueyn. If their dedys be wycked / it is her owne clothing wherby they may be knowē but her priuey werkes and their pry¦uey teching ben their owne frute whiche comōly ben ful wycked And so by that that they do and teche priuely men may best kno¦we what they been. Diues. I I may wele assent to thy speche for so many wounders haue fal in this londe within a fewe yer̄s in sūne mone and sterres / ī lond ī water in the ayr / that we rede ī no boke yt euir fel so many in so litel tyme And as mē sey ful wic¦ked lyuers do many miracles & prophecye. & yit we wante grace on euery syde / & the harde venge¦ance of god is vpon vs nighte & day / shewynge that god is gre∣uously offēdyd wt vs Pauper. As saith the glose. su{per} illud. ii. ad thessalo. ii.c. In signis & {pro}di¦giis mendacibus. For asmoche as the peple is oute of charite & wole nat knowe the treuth / but trust al in lesynges & in falshede Therfore god suffreth false shre¦wys for to do woūders & mira∣cles for to disceyue the people. &
to holde them styl in her errour. I haue sayde as me thynkethe say forth what thou wylte. The lxiii. chaptre DIues. What seyst thou of them that wole no solem¦nyte haue in their buriynge. but be putt in erthe anon / and that ye shulde be spente aboute the buri¦yng they bydde that it shulde be youen to the pore folke blynde. and lame Pauper. Comonly in such priue buriynges ben ful smalle doles and lytel almes yo¦uen And in solemne buriynges. been grete doles / and moche al∣messe youen / for moche pore peo∣ple come thanne to seke almesse But whanne it is done priuely fewe wytte therof. and fewe co∣me to axe almesse / for they wote nat whanne ne where ne whom they shulde axe it. And therfore I leue sikerly that sūme fals ex¦ecutoures that wolde kepe alle to themself. bigāne firste this er¦rour and this folye Diues. And yit men holde it a grete {per}fection these daies. Pauper. Though men burie their frendes priuely. or ayertly / it is no harme to the dede ne to the liuynge But if the worship of god be withdrawen. and the almesse of the pore nedy and the holy prayers and suffra¦ges of holy churche / whiche ben ordeyned to be praied and done for the dede and the quicke that haue nede therof But it is a gre¦te foly and also a grete synne to forsake solempne buriynges / yt be done principally for the wor¦shyp of god and for the proufyt of the dede / spendyng his godes to nedeful releuyng of holy chir¦che / and the pore nedye people yt been of no power to helpe theim self. for that is a custome of fals executoures that wolden make themself riche with dede mēnys godes / and nat dele to the pore. after dedes wylle / as nowe alle false executoures vse by custo∣me. And so they that forsake worshipful buriynge as I haue rehersyd bifore lette the prisyng the worshippe / and the sacrifice and offrynge that shulde be do∣ne to god. They do also dispyte to holy churche / in that that they forsake the prayer. and the suf∣frages of holy mynistres of ho∣ly churche. Also they offende all the soules of purgatory that shulde be releuyd by messes syn∣gynge / hooly prayer and suffra¦ges of holy churche / whiche ben ordeynyde in buriynge to helpe
of alle cristen soules And they please the feende that is besy ni∣ght and day to lette goddes offi∣ce  goddes worshyp and holy p̄y¦er Also they offende mankynde. and god that tooke mankynde. of a woman / in asmoche as they putte their body in suche dispite and pryue it of the due worship For the body of a gode man / or of a gode woman that is knytte to that preciouse soule yt Cryste bought so dere. With his precio{us} blode / with whiche soule it shal ryse apen at the dome / and lyue in blysse withouten ende brigh∣ter than the sonne / it is of ful gre¦te dignyte / al if it be here in gre∣te myscheyf for a tyme for adā∣mes synne. Mannys body is of fulle grete dignyte in that / ye god toke oure body of a woman alo¦ne / and bicame man withouten parte of man / and bodily in oure kynde reigneth god and man a∣boue alle creatures And therfore by wey of kynd and for worship of god that toke oure kynde / it oweth to be worshiped / namely in his deth / for than is no drede of pryde. And therfore sayth the wyseman. Eccle. vii.c. Mor∣tuo non prohibeas graciam. withdrawe nat thy grace. & thy mercy from the dede. That is to say withdrawe nat ne lette natt he due seruyce and worshipfull cerymonies that longe to the bo¦dy / ne the suffrages and prayers that longe to the soule as sayth. the the glose And in a nother pla¦ce he sayth thus Sonne wepe thou on the dede man with byt∣ter teres and grete sorow / and af¦ter his state as righte is hile his body / dispyse nat his buriynge. make mornynge one day or .ii. after his deserte Eccle. xxxviii c. For by the lawe of kynde. by lawe writen. by lawe of grace & euery tyme worshipful sepultu∣re after mennys power hathe be due dette to mannys bodye and womannes. In the lawe of kynde haue we exāple of Abra∣ham Isaac and Iacob / and her wyues / whiche hadde ful costly buryinges. As we rede in holy wrytte Gen. lvi.c. And in the lawe wryten haue we example. of Samuel / Dauid: salomn / io¦saphat / ezechie. iosie / tobie / and of the machabeis / whose buryin¦ges were costly and worshipful In the lawe of grace / that is in the new lawe haue we example of oure lorde Ihesu Cryste / whi¦che nat withstondynge that he suffcyde spytefulle deth for man¦kynde. yitt he wolde haue / and hadde worshypfulle and costly sepulture and buriynge.
As we fynde in the gospelle Io. xix.c. wherby as the glose saith there he yaue men exāple to ke∣pe worshypful buriyng after ye custome of the cuntre And ther∣fore he cōmendyd mary mawde¦leyn / yt she came bifore his dethe to anoynte his body so precious¦ly and costly into the sepulture. And many seyntes were buryed worshipfully by the doynges of aūgelles / as seynt Clemēt. seint katheryne / seynt agace / and ma¦ny other And seint poule the first hermete was buryed worshipful¦ly and woūderly / by worchinge of lyons / and of wylde bestes / ī tokenyng that mannys body & womans owe to haue worshyp¦ful sepulture For sithen aungel¦les and wylde bestes dyde suche worship to mannys bodye after his deth Moche more mākynde shulde worshyp mannys body: after his deth / and doo worship to his owne kynde. And so men shulde releue pore folke in their myscheyf / and specially in their diynge by almes yeuyng Butte they shulde nat for that do any wronge by their lyuyng to their euen cristen for to make them ri¦che to do moche almesse at their endynge For as the lawe sayth. ther shulde no man be made rich with wronge and harme of a no¦ther. Locupletari non debet ali¦quis cum alterius īiuria vel iac¦tura. Extra de regulis iuris. li∣bro vi. The lxiiii. chaptre. DIues. What sayst thou of them that holde market∣tes and feyres in holy churche & in sanctuary / Pauper. Bothe the byer and the seller and mē of holy church that mayntene hem or suffre them whanne they my∣ght lett it ben acursed. For we fynde nat that euir Criste punis¦shed so hard any synne while he went here in erth / as he dyd by∣ynge & sellynge in goddes house as we fynde Io. xi.c. On a ty∣me he came īto the temple of Ie¦rusalem / and there he foūde mē biyng and sellyng oxen & shepe and doues to be offryd in the tē∣ple / and chaungers of money al¦so to be offryd in the temple. He was highly offendyd / and made a scourge and bette them out of the temple / and saide to them on this wyse Myne house shuld be an house of prayer / and ye haue made it a dēne of theuys. Bere ye out said he this marchaūdise Lede hēs these bestes & make ye nat my faders hous an house of
marchaundise and a dēne of the¦uys. And as seynt Matheu tel∣leth & other gospellers / he drewe downe her bothes / and ouirtur∣nyd theire stalles and their setis and shedde their money. And as seint marke sayth. he wolde nat suffre no vessel that was nat lō∣gynge to the temple. to be borne through the temple And sithen. Cryste wolde nat suffre thynge be solde in the temple / that was only for the worship of god. and help of the temple Moche more he wole nat suffre thynge to be solde in the temple that longith nat to the temple. but only to se¦culertie. Diues. Sithen god was soo offendyde for that men solde therin that was nedeful to the temple. and for easement of hem that came fro ferre cuntrees what shuld he haue do / if he had founde them biynge and selling thynge of seculerte Or if he had founde theym in bacbiyng and glotony / dronkenshyp / lichery / ī songe & speche of rybaudrye. as mē vse these daies ī holy church. Pauper. Seynt austyn sayth. that as he trowyth he shulde haf caste them to the pytte of helle. Diues. Howe mighte Cryste yt was so pore a mā haue cast out suche a multitude of people. It is a wounder yt they withstoden him nat. Pau{per}. For as the glo¦se sayth ther came suche a lighte out of his face by wey of his god hode as long as he wolde yt they were al aferid of the sight of his face and fledde awaye. And for the same skyl in tyme of his pas¦siō whā they came for to take hī he sayde I am he yt ye seke / twy¦es they went bakwarde. and for drede felle downe to grounde. Diues. Why sayde he that they made his hous a dēne of theues Pau{per}. For who so is about to begile any man or womā of his gode / he is a theef And in biyng and sellynge either of them is a∣bout to begile other / and in that they been theues. And for yt they doo it in goddes house & there ca¦ste in their herte howe priuelye & how slighly they may begile her euyn cristen / therfore they make goddes house a dēne of theuys: And comonly in suche fayres. and markettes where soo euir it be holden / ther ben many theues mychers and cutte purses. Diues. And I drede me that fulle often by suche fayres god∣des house is made a tauerne of glutones / and a bordelle of ly∣choures: For the marchaun∣tes and chapmen kepe there wt theym their wyues & lēmannes. bothe night and day.

And if any mā comyne ther̄ fles¦shely with his wyf or his lēman the churche and the church yerde also ben pollute And if it might be preuyd ther shulde no preeste synge ne say no messe therin / ne body be buryed tyl it were recoū¦seiled ayen by the busshop.

Sithen men of holy churche do somoche dispite to god and holy church / though they be ī dispite themself / it is no wounder Pau{per}. That is soth For god sayth in holy wryt Pri¦mo regū. ii.c / who so worship¦peth me sayth he / I shalle make him worshipful / And they that dispyse me shalbe in dispyte. Diues. I thanke the with alle myn herte For that me thought sumtym no synne / nowe I kno¦we wele that it is a fulle greuo{us} dedly synne For the synnes and the erroures that we haue nowe spoken of / ben openly ayenst ye worshyp of the high maiestye of god / and ayenst the first cōmaū¦dement that moste oughte to be charged / And thy skylles ben so grete and thy speche soo open / yt ignoraunce myghte nat excuse me ne any wight elles that can reason And yit the peple by mys¦custome and ignoraunce of mē of holy churche and of themself also by couetise and pryde of ye clergie is so blēt that they thynk theym no synnes. And so we wander in synne blent with foly and wante grace. Pauper. Wyckyd custome aggregith syn

I pray the en¦fourme me noweī ye secoūde {con}maūdmēt. Pauper. What doute haste thou therin Diues. In the secounde maundemente god byddeth that we shulde nat take his name ī veyne For who so dothe shalbe gilty & nat passe vnpunysshed Pauper. In thre maners goddes name is taken ī veyne. That is by myslyuyng. by mys speche / & by mysheringe Firste by myslyuyng / for whan man or woman is cristned. ther̄ he forsaketh the feende and alle his werkes and his lordshyppe. Whan his god fader and his god moder aunswere for him sayng. Abrenuncio. that is to say I for¦sake And there he knyttyth him to criste. & makith couenaunte with him to be his true seruaūte withouten ende And there he ta¦kethe the name of Cryste vpon him and bicometh cristen For al cristen people is named aft{er} cryst and he is oure principal godfa∣der For cristen cūmyth of criste. and so alle cristen people bere ye name of criste vpon theim. And so in asmoche as we been clepyd cristē and goddes peple. in that we bere the name of god vpon. vs. And therfore sayth the pro∣phete / Tu in nobis es dn̄e et no∣mē sanctū tuum inuocatum est super nos: ne derelīquas nos do¦mine deus nt. Ieremye xiiii.c. Lorde sayth he thou arte amon∣ges vs / as a lorde amonges his seruantes / and thyn holy name is clepyd vpon vs / lord our god forsake vs nat But if it be so. yt we lyue natt after oure name / yt we haue taken of cryste ne lyue nat as cristen men ne as goddes seruauntes / but forsake hym & turne ayen to the feende and ly∣ue nat as cristen folke / but as ie¦wys sarsyn or paynym / or elles worse. than take we goddes na¦me in veyne. for our name and oure lyf accordeth nat. And as seynt poule sayth / wyc∣ked cristen folke with their wyc¦ked dedys and their wycked ly∣uyng forsake god And therfore alle wyckid lyuers and namely ypocrites that bere the name of holynesse and of cristes seruaun¦tes. & wt yt they be yt feēdes seruā¦tes / they take goddes name in

My name is dis¦pised by you all day amonge o∣ther naciones or hethen men. For by the wycked lyuynge of cristē peple ye name of crist is sha¦myd And therfore we say in oure prayer. Sanctificetur nomē tu¦um. Halowyd & worshipyd be thy name. That is to say graūt vs grace no thing to do / ne wyl. ne to speke yt / wherby thy name shulde be vnworshipyde or sha∣myd in vs. The secounde chapter ALso goddes name is take in veyne by mys speche / & that in many wyse Firste by na∣mynge of goddes name ī veyne tales tellynge / in iapery ī scorne For in suche vanyte goddes na¦me shulde nat be namyd. Diues. Telle sūme example Pauper. As if one sayde to the in scorne whanne he is wroth wt the / god make the a gode man. And sūme say of a nother ī scorn that god hathe forsaken him / & iapers and disoures comōly na∣me goddes name ī veyne in this maner / though they swere none othe. And al suche take goddes name in ydelship / that teche any erroures or herisies ayenst faith and ayenst god / or preche or te∣che the treuthe only for couetyse or for enuye / or for vayne glory and nat for helth of mānys soul ne for worship of god And ther∣fore the {pro}phete saith thus. Peccatori autem dixit de{us} / qua re tu enarras iusticias meas: et assumis testamentum meum {per} os tuū. God sayde to the syn∣ful man / why tellyst thou my ri∣ghtfulnesses / and takyst my tes¦tamēt & my law by thy mouth & so ofte namyst my name. For al¦tho that teche wele & speke wele. and wole nat doo therafter: they take goddes name in veyne Al∣so goddes name is takē ī veyne by cursyng & weriyng / as whan men or wymen in wrath or elles in nyce myrthe saye to a nother. god yeue the myschaūce / god ye¦ue the euyl grace / euyl deth Al∣so it is taken in veyne oft tyme. by vowes makynge / and that ī dyuerse maner / Firste if mā ma¦ke any vowes to any creature. For vowes makynge is a dyuy¦ne worship that owyth to be do only to god and to no creature.
And therfore the prophete saith. Vouete & reddite dn̄o deo vestro Make ye youre vowes to oure lorde god / and yeldith theym to hun. Also it is taken in veyne whanne folire kepe nat their vo¦wes that been lefulle: but breke them retchesly / or by freyltie wt¦outen nede & withouten auctori¦tie. of their soueraynes / whiche haue power to dispēse with hem or chaunge their vowes. Also if men make vowes vnlefulle. ayenst charite. & to do any thing ayenst goddes lawe As if thou madest a vowe to sle thyn euyn cristen / or yt thou shuldest neuyr do gode to pore men / for parauē¦ture sūme pore man hath aggre¦ued the. Also whāne men make vowes vnwisely lightly wtoute auysement and by comon custu¦me of speche. The .iii. chaptre DIues. And suche vowes ben made these dayes ful many For with moche folke be they ones spoken. they been noo more thought on. For they be so comon in theire mouthe. Pauper. Therfore they synne ful greuously / so takinge goddes name in veyne For ther shulde no vowe be made but for a thynge of charite / and with a gode auysement. ¶We fynde in holy wrytte Iudicum xi.c. that ther was a leder & a iuge of goddes peple / whos name was Iept And whanne he shulde go to fight ayenst goddes enemyes the folke of amon / he made his vowe to god that if he yaue him the vitorye of his enemyes whā he came home ayen what lyuīg thing he mette first of his house / holde in his cūmynge hoome / he shulde sle it / & offre it vp to god ī sacrifice After this as god wold he hadde the maistree and came home with grete worship / whan his doughter herde these tidyn∣ges she was full glade and toke her tymber in her hōde and came in grete haste first of al the hous¦holde daunsynge pleynge & syn¦gynge ayēst her fader for to wel¦come him home.

It was nat lefulle For by his vowe if he hadde firste mette with a cat or an hounde cūmynge ayenst him he shulde haue made sacrifice to god therof / which sacrifice shuld haue ben abhominacion to god for neither was able to be offred in sacrifice. And for asmoche as he made his vowe so vnwysely. god suffryd him to falle īto yt mis¦cheyf to sle an īnocēte his owne doughter ayenste goddes lawe. For god saith Innocētē et iustū non occides.

The vii. chapter. DIues. Why forbidith crist men to swere by creatur̄s Pauper. Ther is ii maner of swerynge. One is a takynge of wytnesse of thynge. that a man sweryth by / and so it is nat leful for to swere by any creatur̄ For seynt poule saith. Hoīes {per} maio¦rē suū iurant. ad hebre. vi. Mē swere saith he by their more / yt is to say by him that is more of cre¦dence and of reuerēce than they been theim self But only god is more in dignitye and more in or¦der of kynde than man. for he is both god and man And therfore he wole that we take in swerīg no wytnesse but only of him / for he is souerayne treuthe And ther¦fore suche maner swerynge is a diuyne worship that longith on¦ly to god and to no creature For god wole that whāne men may haue no wytnesse of treuthe yat is nedefulle and profitable to be bileuyd / yt they take him to wyt¦nesse and swere by hym as by so¦uerayne treuthe and by no crea∣ture For suche maner swerynge is a diuyne worship that lōgith to god & to no creature. As saith the glose Mt v.c. sup illud. Nō piurabis. And as austyne saith. ī the same place / who so swerith by any creat{ur}e / he swerith by god yt made that creature And therfo¦re criste bad. yt men shulde swere by no creatures. For if they doo lightly they falle in double syn. bothe in ydolatrye and in {per}iury. Firste in ydolatrye. for the wor∣ship yt longith only to god. they do it to creatures Also they falle ofte so in {per}iurye. For men drede lesse to lye and to forswere them whanne they swere by creatures than whanne they swere by god allone. The viii. chaptre. ANother maner swerynge is by execration and imp̄¦cation / that is whanne man or woman in his sweryng prayeth openly or priuely ayenst hī self. or ayenst any thinge that he lo∣uyth / or any other thinge but it be as he saith. And th{us} sūme mā sweryth by his hede / sūme man by his thedame For as seynt au¦styn sayth / he that sweryth so he byndeth him self & leith his hede & his thedame / in plegge to god. and prayeth to god that he leese his hede and his thedame. & ne∣uyr thryue but it be as he saithe. or but he do as he saith or hotith Sūme swere by theire soule / by their chaffare & by al the gode yt they haue / and so bynde them to lese their soul / their chaffare & al their gode. and bynde their soul to the fyre of helle withoutē ēde but it be as they say.

In this othe mē forsake ye helpe of god and of oure lady / and of alle the cumpany of heuyn at the day of dome / but it be so as they saye And ouir that if they swere fals. they clepe god to wytnesse. of a thynge that is false. and sayen that god whose name is treuthe beryth them wytnesse of a thing that is fals And so they lye on god and do him greate velonye. for he was neuir fals wytnesse. ne neuyr shalbe For he is soue∣rayne treuth that nat disseyueth ne may nat be disseyued.

For that men shulde charge their othe the more.

Whan man or woman in anguysshe & disease makith a vowe to be hol¦pen / been they nat boūden to ful¦fylle that vowe though āguyssh & disease catche. or styrre theym therto Pauper. yhis forsothe if they thought on the cause whye they made it. & were in purpose. than to bynde theym if they had their desire & helpe / in that nede. so yt by kepynge of theire vowe. they ben better disposed to kepe goddes cōmaūdemētes / for ther¦to shulde al comon vowes deser¦ue And the wyf that in peryl of childe beryng or of other seknes makith a vowe al if she oughte none to make / withouten leeue of her husbonde / yit she owythe nat to do ayenste yt vowe by her owne dome / ne withoutē dome of her souerayn / if she fele her hol¦pen by the vowe. Nathelesse I trowe that her husbōde may vn∣bynde her therfro / and her confes¦soure also / by chaungynge into some other gode dede / and name¦ly if ye keping of ye vowe shuld turne īto p̄iudice of the husbōde. or lettynge of the better dede. For wyues owe nat to mak gre¦te vowes that shulde be in disese and p̄iudice of their husbonde Ne children within age. shulde make none a vowe / withouten assent of their fader or of their tu¦toure Ne the seruaūte ī p̄iudice. or hyndrynge of his lorde or of his maister And if he do / his lord or maister may reuoke it / and so may the fader the childes / and ye husbonde the wyues Other vo∣wes that been no preiudice to ye

Whethir is more med¦ful to do a gode dede wt a vowe or withoutē a vowe. Pauper. With a vowe / for vowe makīg is one of the highest worshyp yt man may do to god Quia est ac¦tus latrie. Also by vowe man lowyth him mooste to god. and yeueth to god the mooste yifte yt he may yeue that is his free wyl. As he yeueth a greter gyfte that yeueth the tree with fruyt / thāne he that yeuyth the fruyt / and re∣seruyth to him the tree Also by vowe mānys wylle is more sta∣bled in godenesse Nathelesse for asmoch as man and womā ben fulle frayl & chaungeable / ther∣fore mē shulde nat make vowes but fewe and with a gode auyse¦mente For brekynge of vowes is greate dishonoure to god. Diues. What if a man make a vowe only vnder condicion. Pauper. If the condicion fall or be he is boūde / elles nat. And if a man bynde hym by dyuerse causes / if the one falle he is boū¦den though the other falle natt. As if I made a vowe. to goo to Seynt Iames in hope to fynde there my brother / and also to ha¦ue redēpciō of my sīnes / though I wyste after certaynly that I shulde nat fynd my brother ther̄ yit I were bounde to go thyder. for the other cause. Diues. For howe many causes is mā or wo∣man vnbounde from his vowe. Pauper. For iiii. causes First if the principal causes of his vo¦we makynge fayle As if a man make a vowe to faste alle the sa¦tdayes to haue helth of his child if the child amende nat he is nat bounde therto. Also if it be made vndre condicion / yat is nat ne fallith nat Also if he soue¦reyne vnbynde him therof. Also by vnpower if may nat kepe it. Diues. Thanne if a mayden make a vowe to lyue in maydē¦hode alle her her lyf / if she be cor¦rupte and lese her maydenhode. she is vnbounde from her vowe. for she may no lēger lyue ī may∣denhode Pauper. Al if she may no lenger lyue in maydenhode. yit she is bounde to {con}tynence al her lyf / and to kepe her vowe in
asmoche as she may And so it is of other vowes yt men may natt alle do / for they ben boūde to do that they may do. Moreouir ye shal vnderstonde ye sūme vowe is of nede / as the vowe yt we ma¦ke in baptym / to forsake the fe∣ende / and to kepe the feyth of ho¦ly churche. And other vowes of free wyl. as whanne man byn∣deth him frely to do a gode dede. Withoutē which he may be saued as fastynge contynence pilgra∣mage. Two thinges be nedeful in chagyng of vowe. Rightful cause. and autorite of the soue∣raynes In dispensacion of the vowe of abstinēce or such other must be taken hede to the riches∣ses or the pouertie of the persone For a pore man ī caas owith to haue asmoche dispensacion. for a peny or for right noughte. as a grete lorde for an hundryd marke Sūme condiciones been vnderstonde in vowes thoughe a man say them nat / as I shalle do if I lyue / if god wole. Other condicions ben more special / as I shal visytte seint thomas if I go into kent By both maner of these condicions if they fayl mā is excused of his vowe / if it stō∣de ful in that condiciō The hus¦bonde may nat entre into religi∣on / but his wif make first vowe of {per}petuel contynence Neither the wyf ne the husbōde may ma¦ke vowe of contynce withoutē other assente Solempne vowe of continēce lettith matrymony doon. and for to be doone. If it be nat solēne if the {per}sone wedde the matrymony holdith. He must yelde the dette of his body to his wyf / but he may nat axe it of her Solempne vowe is ma¦de by takynge of holy ordre / or by entre into religion Thoughe a man or woman breke his fast bicaus of seknes / he brekith nat his abstinence.

The xvii. chapter. DIues. Whether is {per}iurye. more synne or manslau∣ghter. Pau{per}. Periury is more. For as saith seynt poule Ad he∣breos vi.c. Men shuld swere by their better and their greter / and of euery contrauersye / that is to say. of euery cause that is in de∣bate to conferme the true party. the laste ende is an othe For eue¦ry suche cause is termyned & en∣dyd by an othe And sithē it is so yt the cause of manslaughter and of euery open synne touchynge mannys dome muste be termy∣ned by an othe / {per}iurye muste be taken for a passynge synne and so it is. For who so forswerythe him wyttyngly he forsakith his god And therfore {per}iury is grea∣tyst syn of al synnes next ydola¦trye For it is ayenst the secoūde cōmaūdemēt / & īmediate ayēst god / & dispite & forsaking of god But manslaughter is īmediate ayenst mā And though man wt manslaughter greuyth god full highly / yit he forsakith nat god ne dispiseth hī / ne dishonoureth him so moche as he doth by {per}iu∣rye. And as the phisopher sayth. In principio metaphisice. Amō¦ges hethen mē othe hath euir be worshipful For euery sect. iewe sarsyn. paynym. fleeth to swere falslye by his goddes name / as moste incouenient And if man∣slaughter were more syn than {per}∣iurye / it were but a folye to trye the cause of manslaughter by a∣ny oth For it is semely yt he that was nat aferide to do the greate synne of manslaughter / shuld li¦tel drede to forfete ī the syn of {per}∣iury if it were lesse And thus saiy seint thomas in qōe. de quolibet & Io ī sū. li.i. ti. q̄. xxiiii vt{rum}.

Therfore men shulde bisily fle {per}iurye and

The kyngdome is flyttyd and chaungyd fro nacion to na¦cion. for wronges. vnrightful∣nes and despites done to goddes name in dyuerse gyles But {per}iu∣rye is cause of alle false domes & wronges / and of alle vnrighte∣fulnesse / cause of gyle and trea∣sone / & of greate dispites / yt been done to god and man For as I saide firste euery cause muste be endyd by wytnesses or by ques∣tes / whiche been sworne to saye treuthe / and also by a iuge whi∣che is sworne to god. and to the kinge to deme rightful doome. And if they that ben chargyd to say the treuthe yeue noo tale to forswere theym. and to lye / they shal disceyue the iuge / and doo him yeue a false dome Suche {per}∣iurers robbe men of their gode / & disherite moche folke They sa∣ue stronge theues / and slee true men Suche robbe folke of their gode name. such ben fals to god to the kynge / to prelates of holy churche. Suche been cause that this lōde is in poynte to be loste & to be chaūged to a nother naci¦on & īto a newe tūge And yt may nat be withoute shedynge of mo¦che bloode and manslaughtere. And soo periurye is cause of mo¦che manslaughter. Al∣so {per}iurye is cause why we haue so many theues & māquellers in this londe For they hope alway to be saued by {per}iurye and falshe¦de of questmongers / yt for lytelle gode wole forswere them. And therfore ī hope of {per}iury they ben so bolde in their synne / to robbe sle. & brenne / for though they be¦takē yit they hope to scape by {per}∣iurye And if they were siker that ther wolde no man ne womā for¦swere hī to saue them / they wold neuir be so bolde to synne And al other shulde be the more aferyde to synne / if they wyste wel that true dome shuld passe withoutē {per}iurye. Suche synful wretches as saith the {pro}phete ysaie xxiii.c haue put their hope al in lesīges & in {per}iury / & by lesinges falshede & {per}iurye / they been mayntened. & nat chastised Also it is syn alle ayenst kynde to saue a theef ī di¦spyte of god / whose name they forswere ayenst his cōmaūdmēt For he byddeth that ther shulde no man take his name in veyne Also he saith Non suscipies vo∣cem mendacii / nec iūges manū vt {pro} impio dicas falū testimo∣niū.

And as holy doctoures say a mā shulde rather suffre the moste dis¦pito{us} deth of body than he shuld forswere hī or do any dedly syn. Moche more he shulde nat for∣swere him ne do no dedly synne. to saue a theues lyf / that god. & londes lawe cōmannde to sle. ¶It felle late in this londe that a Scott appelyd an englisshmā of high tresone / whāne he shuld fighte bifore a iuge in their cau∣se / the iuge as the maner is putt them bothe to their othe. Whāne the scotte shulde swere he said to the iuge. Lorde I came nat hy∣der to swere I came to fight. for my chalenge was to fight / and therto I am redy / but swere wol I nat / for I made no chalenge to swere The iuge saide yt but if he wolde swere. that his appele was true / elles he shulde be ta∣ken as a cōuycte & a taynt tray∣toure / and be hangyd & drawen withoute fightynge And soo he was / for he wolde nat swere wit¦tynge wele that his appele was false / and made only for malice as he knowlechyd er he dyed. This man might haue sworne. and happely haue hadde the bet¦ter of his aduersary and escapid the dethe.

For he helde it as it is a greter synne thā mā∣slaughter And though he wolde auēge him on man for rancour of herte / yit on god he wold nat venge him by {per}iurye. And soo god saued them both fro {per}iury & māslaughter & yaue them grace to dye ī charite / & do a seeth both to god and man.
The xviii. chaptre. DIues. Sithen {per}iury is so grete a syn / what peyne is ordeyned therto by the lawe. Pauper. As the law saith xxii q̄. i. p̄dicādū. Asmoche penaūce shulde be enioyned for {per}iury / as for manslaughter and auoutre. And they shuld neuir more be ta¦ken to swere or to bere wytnesse in any dome / but be forsaken in euery dome. as taynte fals. and alwey suspecte of falshede.

For their is no synne so noyous to a reme & to euery comynte as is {per}iury For yt is cause yt yer may no syn be punysshed / ne malefac¦toures ne felones chastised / nee wronges redressyd Men of holy churche shulde be degraded / and lewde folke accursed .xi. q̄. i. cō¦spirationū &c. cōiuiationū.

For as I haue red. the Realme of englonde for {per}iurie & falshede was translated from britons to saxones Afterwarde it was trās¦latyd for {per}iurye from saxones. and englisshe men to the danys. Afterwarde whāne englisshe mē hadde the kingdome ayen by ye deth of the danys / they kepte it but two kinges tymes / seynted warde and horaldes / and anone it was translated ayen for {per}iu∣rye vnto the normaynes by wyl¦liam duke of normandy / which slowe vp nigh al the cheualrye. of this londe / and chaungyd the lordship and the prelacy of this londe nigh alle vnto the frenche mē And what mordre & sheding of blode felle for these {per}iurers in these thre tymes and chaungin∣ges is fulle harde to telle. And nowe alas newly in oure dayes we ben fallē in {per}iurye in the hy∣ghest degre / nat one but nigh al And what blode hath be shedde sithe / bicause of oure {per}iurye / no tunge can telle And this londe by shedyng of blode is so feblys∣shed ī euery state that we be nat of power withoutē special mira¦cle of god lenger to withstonde. And so it is ful moche to drede yt this Realme in shorte tyme for oure {per}iurye shalbe translatyd a∣yen to the britones / or elles to sū¦me other tunge. I pray the saye forthe what thou wylte The xix. chaptre PAuper. Ferthermore I saide yt goddes name is ta¦ken in veyne by mysheryng For if thou haue liking to here grete othes of other men / or any mys¦swerynge / Or if thou wate natl veyne othes ne art nat myspay∣ed whan thou heryst them / thou takest goddes name in veyne For thou doste no worship ther∣to: as thou oughtest to doo For as salomon saith a mānys here shulde ryse for fere / and he shuld stop his erys whan he herde god¦des name so dispised And if a man swere to the sadly ī goddes name and auysely / thou art boū¦dē to lene hī for worship of god¦des holy name / but you haue ye more euidēce to ye {con}trarie. And but thou accepte his othe & yeue

If I fynde a man ofte false in his othes / though I leue him nat I do god no dishonoure. Pau{per}. That is soth / for thou may wel wete that god souerayne treuth beryth him no wytnesse ī his fals¦hode And therfore doo worshyp to his othe and to goddes name and repreue his falsehode & dys∣pyte. that he dothe to goddes ho¦ly dame Moreouir if thou here men swere or blasphemegoddes name / or name goddes name in vanytie / if thou haue likynge therin / thou takist goddes name in veyne. And but thou snyb or rep̄ue them if thou haue power ouir them / & gruche ayen a their synful speche / elles thou takyst goddes holy name in veyne. by heryng Also if thou haue likīge to here erroures ayenst the feithe of holy churche to cōsent to hem or shrewyd tales / or veyne tales medlyd with goddes name & vn¦honest speche / ayēst the worship¦ful name of criste and of cristen¦dome / whiche speche no gode cri¦sten man ne womā owith to he¦re / thou takyst goddes name in veyne by hering For if thou loue wele thy god thou shuldest natt here paciently any speche yt sow∣neth dishonoure to his holy na∣me For if thou louedyst wele a∣ny man or woman / thou wolde here no speche sownynge ayenst their name and worship ne that might be causes of their offense. or velonye. The xx. chaptre. ALso goddes name is takē in veyne by brekynge of couenaunte made in goddes na¦me / and cōfermyd by swerynge in goddes name. As whan peas and couenaunt is made bi¦twene kinges and realmes / by∣twene comynties / and bitwene persones / and bitwene comynte & {per}sone / & is confermyd by swe∣rynge Than euery mā & womā that knowith it shulde fle to for¦fete in worde or dede ayenst the couenaunte & the pease / for re∣uerence of goddes holy name by whiche it was confermyd.

shulde be broken / if the couenāt be leful / al if it be nat plesaunte they take goddes name in veyn And alle tho that knowe of the couenaūte and of the othe / if by retchleshede of speche or of dede ben cause of brekynge of peas & of suche couenaūtes whether it touche theym or nat / they take goddes holy name in veyne and do dispyte therto / sithen the pees and the couenaunte was made ī goddes holy name / and confer∣myd also. We rede also in ho∣ly wrytte / Iosue ix. chapter. That whanne Iosue and god∣des people biganne to conquere the londe of biheste / the folke of gabaon in gyle sent messangers to iosue to make peas with Io∣sue and with goddes people. The messangers in gyle dyd on olde clothes cloutyd / olde shone patched and alle to torne They toke hored brede ī their scrippes. soure wyne in their botels. and lodyd asses with old hored brede in old sackes / and came so to io¦sue / and made a presaunt to him of olde vitayles and said to him ¶youre name springeth fer and wyde that ther may no kyng no nacion withstōde you Therfor̄ we be come to you for saluaciō of our lyues to make peas with you Thanne iosue and the peo∣ple saide to theym If ye dwel in the londe that god hath yeuen to vs / we may no peas make with you Thanne iosue axed theym what they were and from whēs they came Sir saide they we ben thy seruauntes & came to the fro fulle ferre cuntrees / sente fro the lordes & the leders of oure londe to make peas with the Thou may see by oure araye yt we be co¦me fro fer For whanne we come oute oure clothes and our shone were newe / they ben al to torne & alle to rente.

I trowe yt clerkes these daies wolde say that they were nat bounde to kepe that othe / si¦then they gate that othe of them with so grete gyle. Pauper. If they auysed hem wele they wold say as iosue saide For as I said firste. a man owythe to kepe his oth if it be leful though he made it for drede of deth For euery oth leful owyth to be kept though it be neuyr so moche ayenst herte. And that shewyth god wele aft{er}∣warde For as we fynde the se∣counde boke of kinges xxi.c. Thre hūdryd yere after.

Dauyd sente after the gabyonites that were lefte. and sayde to them. I knowe wele yt for you this hūgre and myscheif is fallen in my realme Axe ye a∣mendes what ye wole & I shall do it Thanne they saide we axe neither golde. ne syluer / ne noo mannys dethe of israel / but on∣ly vengeaunce on saule and his kynrede that so wyckydly opp̄s¦syd vs and destroied vs. We axe that euery man of his kynred be slayne. and that none be left of his kynrede.

As sayth
the maister of the stories. Whan this was done the hūgre ceased. and anone began reyne and plē¦tye of corne and fruyt. Diues. This example is ful gode and shewith wele that euery othe le∣fulle shulde be kepte And that e¦uery man and woman shuld fle to do dishonoure or spite to god¦des name Also it shewyth wele yt {per}iurye and dispisyng of goddes holy name is cause of shedynge of blode / of hungre / and of mys¦cheyf / And that god wole nat suffre that his name be dys∣pised ne taken ī veyne Pauper Therfore god saithe that euery man and woman that so takith his name in veyne. I shal do to the as thou haste hadde swering in dispyte. and chargyste nat to breke couenaunt / therfore thou shalt bere thy synne & haue dys∣pite yerfore Eze. xvi.c. Also he saith thus by the prophete If ye wole nat here ne sette in herte to yeue worshippe to my name / I shal sende in you hungre & nede and myscheyf And I shal curse your blessynges / and take your mighte from you / that ye shalle nat withstonde. Malachie ii.c. Here endith the secounde p̄cepte and begynneth the thridde DIues. I thanke the moche.

Nowe I pray the enfourme me in the thridde cōmaundmēt. Pauper. In the thridde com∣maundement god byddeth that thou shuldest bithynke the. and haue wele in mynde to halowe thyn holiday. Sixe daies thou shalte worche and do alle thyne owne werkes. In the seuynthe day is the sabot / that is to saye. reste of thy lorde god In that daye thou shalte do noo seruyle werk / neither thou ne thy sonne thy doughter / ne thy seruaunte. man ne woman / ne thy beest / ne ne the straunger. that is within thy yate. Diues. Why badde god that the seuynth day shulde more be halowed thanne the syxte daye. Pauper. For as god sayth there In syxe day∣es he made heuene and erth and see / and alle thynge that is ther∣in. And in the seuynthe daye he restyd and ceasyd of his werkes And therfore he blessyd that day and halowyde it / and ordeyned that in that day man and beeste shulde reste / And that man
that day shulde specially thank god. For alle the creatures that he made bifore ī vi. dayes he ma¦de to helpe and seruyce and sola¦ce of man Diues. Why saith ho¦ly wrytte that god restyd the se∣uynth daye. sithen he trauayled neuyr For as seint austyn saith he made alle thinges withouten trauayl / & as holy wryt shewith Genesis primo .c. He saide butt this one shorte worde Fiat. and badde that it shulde be done / a∣non it was done as he wolde. Pauper. Whanne holy wrytte saith that god rested the seuynth daye / he vnderstondeth therby yt in the seuynthe daye he ceasyde to make new creatures For eue¦ry thinge was made bifore ī the vi. daies either in the thyng him self / as aungel / light sonne mo∣ne sterres / either in his kynde & ī his simylitude / as mā best fysshe foule and grasse / and tre / either ī his causes / as thynge gendryde of corruption / and thyng made by crafte For god ī his godhede. Was neuir in trauayl but alway in blisful reste withoutē ende. And therfore holy wrytte saythe nat that he restyd after his werk ne in his werke / but yt he restyde from euery werke that he hadde made For he hadde no trauayle for any werke / and he was natt holpē by his werke / for he made no thing for nede but al for loue Diues. yit contra te. Cryste saith in the gospelle Io. Pater meus vs{que} modo opera. et ego operor. My fader wor∣chith vnto this tyme / and I wor¦che also Therfore it semyth that god ceased nat the seuynth daye from euery werke Pauper. Two maner of werk is longe to god. creation and gouernaunce From the werk of creation he ce¦syd the seuynthe day / and thāne principally beganne the werke of gouernaunce and of kepyng whiche werke he cōtynueth and shalle contynue withoutē ende. And of this werke of gouernaū¦ce spekyth Cryste the wordes in the gospelle / nat of the werke of creacion. Diues. Ben ther any mo skylles. Why god hadde the vii. day be halowed Pauper. Sixe skilles ther been as sayen these clerkes. Firste for god the vii. day restyd / that is to say / he ceased fro creation of newe crea¦tures Also in tokening that god in the vii. day delyuered the chil¦dren of israel from the harde ser∣uage of egipte / and ledde theym through the rede see drye foote / ī to the reste of the londe of bihest As we rede in holy wrytt Deut. v.c. whiche deliueraunce was
token yt mankynde shuld throu∣ghe cristes passiō & by his blode. yt he shedde vpon the rode / be de∣liuered out of the feendes serua∣ge / and come to the endles reste. of the londe of lyf The iii. cause is yt men shulde yt day principaly yeue them to holy meditacione. and to thanke god of al his yif∣tes & his benefices / and to lerne goddes lawe and to pryse god The fourth cause was to be to∣ken that criste the vii day shuld reste in his graue / after yt he had traueyled vi. daies to refourme ayen mankynd that was lorne through adams synne. The v. cause was to be token yt vs must alle cese from vices and the vii. synnes / if we wole be saued. As the prophete saith. Quiescite a∣gere peruerse / discite bene agere. ysa. i.c. Reste ye to do amys. and lerne ye to do wele The vi. cause is to betokene the endlesse reste that we shal haue from syn and peyne in heuyn blisse / for ye gode werkes that we do the vi. daies of oure lyf / that is to saye al the daies of oure lyf / & the vi. ages of oure syf. & for fulfillyng the vi. dedys of mercy which cri¦ste nameth in the gospel. For as we rede in the apocalips xiiii.c. The holy goste to whome this p̄¦cepte is applied saith that mē af¦ter this lyf shulde rest from their trauailes / for their gode werkes folowe them. The ii. chapter. DIues. Sithen that god badde the vii daye shulde be halowed / why kepe we ye viii daye. that is sundaye. and natt the vii. daye. Pauper. God in the olde lawe yaue three maner of p̄ceptes For sūme wer̄ cerimonyal / sūme iudicial / and sūme moral The cerimonialles were but figure & shadowe of thī¦ges that were to come And ther∣fore whan tho thinges were ful¦fylled that the cerimonyalles be tokenyd / the cerymonials cesyd & vanisshed. awaye / as the sha∣dowe vanyssheth away by light of the sonne Iudicial preceptes were in punisshynge of synne / & iustifiynge / of whiche sūme cea¦sed / sūme duelle yit stylle. Butt moral p̄ceptes yt teche vs to loue oure god. & oure euyn cristen / & to flee synne / & to loue vertues. tho laste alway / as the x. cōmaū¦dementes & suche other. And for asmoche as this p̄cept is cerimo¦nial in party as anentes the ty∣me / and in party it is morall / in asmoche as it techith vs to wor∣shyp
oure god / and to reste from vyces / Therfore in asmoche as it is moralle it is kepte / but in y• that it is cerymonyal / it is chaū¦gyd into sūday as for the better. For that that it figured and be∣tokned is fulfillid That was ye reste of criste in the sepulcre ī the vii day / after the grete trauayle that he hadde vi daies bifore in reformacion and redemption of mankynde Alle be we bounden to worship god nowe in ye newe lawe / but nat in that maner ne ī that tyme that they were boūdē in the olde lawe. Diues. Why is it more chaungyd in the sun∣day thanne into an other day. Pauper. For the greate benefi∣ces & the grete worshipful woun¦ders that god shewyd that daye to mankynde For on the sūday the worlde begāne / & lighte and aungelles kynde was made. That daye god sente aungelles mete manna downe the the chil∣drē of israel in deserte / and fedde them so xl. yere That daye god yaue moyses the lawe in moūte of synay That day criste was borne of the mayden mary to sa¦ue mankynde That day cryste rose from deth to lyf / yeuyng vs example and hope. to ryse from dethe to lyf That day the hooly goste lighted in cristes apostles. and in his disciples. That daye god shal come to dome / as saith a grete clerke dockyng / su{per} deu¦tronomiū. And so that day was the firste day and shalbe the last day that neuir shalle haue ende But it shalbe a daye of endlesse blisse to al yt shalbe saued For right as cryste rose vp from deth to lyf on the sunday / and neuyr dyed after ne shal dye / So shall al we in the laste sonday yt shall be ye last day / ryse vp from deth to lyf and neuir dye after / but ly¦ue in blisse withoutē ende / if we make here a gode ēde This day is so worshipful that no bisshop may be sacryd but on the sūday. As saith Reymūde li.io ti. de fe∣riis. And right as the saturday was halowed ī the olde lawe for the reste ye god made in the satur¦day after the creacion & the wer∣kes that he made in the vi. firste dayes / so holy churche throughe techynge of the holy goste hathe ordeyned the sunday to be halo∣wyd for the rest that mankynde shalle take after vi ages of this worlde on the sondaye / whiche reste and sabott shal neuir haue ende Their sabott that was on the saturday turneth alway ayē to trauayl / but oure sabote that is in the sūday at the laste shalle turne into endles rest ioy & blisse
Sabot in ebrewe is rest ī englis¦she And euery day ī the woke is clepyd sabott & ferie yt is reste in englisshe For euery day we ben boūde to ferie & to reste from syn Also al the woke is clepyd sab∣bot as there. Ieiuno bis in sab∣bato. And Mt vltīo. The sun∣day is clepyd the firste day of ye sabbottes / as there. Vna sabba¦torū. And Mt vltīo. it is saide. Prima sabbtī. For it is first nat only ī ordre of daies / but it is al¦so firste in dignite For the sabot & the reste in the solēpnyte of the saturday of the old lawe is now chaūgyd into the sūday / for syn of the iewes whiche slewe cryste on gode friday / & so putt oure la¦dy seynt mary and al holy chur∣che in sorowe & care & grete tra∣uaile bothe friday and saturday while criste lay ī his graue. But for asmoche as he rose from deth to lyf on the sūday and apperyd to his moder and to his disciples vii sithes ye day / & so on the sun∣day begāne the firste ioye blysse. & reste of the newe lawe / Therfo¦re by goddes rightful dome ye ie¦wys sabot on the saturday / tur∣nyd them to sorowe & care & mo¦che trauayle. and oure sundaye turnyd vs into grete reste & ioye and blisse And as the saturdaye was halowed by the olde lawe. for god graūted that daye firste rest to mankynde after his dam¦nacion to {per}petuel trauayle for adams synne / so is nowe the sū∣day halowyd / for than criste grā¦tyd firste reste ioye & blisse to mā¦kynd in the newe lawe after his passion & the saluacion of man∣kynde & the redempcion / & tnyd the sorowe that holy church had on the saturday by malice of the iewes / into reste & blisse on the sū¦day And so it is fulfylled yt the {pro}¦phete Ieremye saide .xxxi.c. Redemit dn̄s populum suum God hath boughte ayen his pe∣ple with his p̄ciouse blode / and hath deliuered his peple oute of the feendes power I shal saythe god turne their mournyng into ioye / I shal glade theim of their sorowe and conforte them. And by the {pro}phete Osee he saide yt he shulde make the ioy of iewys sa¦botes / & of al their solennyties. and of al their feestes to cese bi∣cause of their synne Osee .ii.c. The iii. chapter ALso for halowyng in the saturday was cerymony al For as we fynde ī diuerse pla¦ces of holy wryt. & namely Eze¦chielis xx.c. Halowyng ī the sa¦turday was a special token yo∣uen to ye iewys wherby they sh∣ulde be knowen from other peo∣ple
/ and so was circūcision. and many other obseruaūcis and ce∣rymonyes god yaue theim to be knowen from other people And therfore right as the circumcisiō and other obseruaunces / yt were bitaken them of god for tokē of distinction from other peple cea¦syd in cristes passion / so cesyd ha¦lowynge in the saturday in Cry¦stes passion For why. although it be a morall p̄cepte to halowe the vii. day / yit it is nat moralle ne byndeth vs to halowe the vii day in the saturday And therfor̄ we rede Exodi. xxxiiii. & xxxv ca. That whāne moyses hadde ben in the mounte of synay with god fourty daies and xl nightes withouten mete or drynke / and spoken with god and there takē the lawe of him in two tables of stone / two stemys and bemes of light risen oute of his face / as it had be two hornes so glysnyng & so bright / that the people was a dred of him & durste natt speke with him / and therfore he putte a veyl bifore his face whāne he shuld speke to the peple / and tel theym the lawes and the wyl of god And whāne he had so hydde his face wt the veyl / the first lawe that he yaue them in goddes na∣me was to halowe the saturday And he spake no worde than of the other ix. preceptes / but tolde forth other obseruaunces & cery∣monyes whiche longed only to the iewys / and were but figure. and shadowe of thīges to come. Whiche cesyd alle in cristes passi¦on And soo he shewyd wele that halowyng in the saturday was cerimonyal / & shulde cease with other cerymonies in cristes passi¦on And therfore whanne he bad them halowe the sat{ur}day / he put the veyle bifore his face in tokē ye halowyng on the saturdaye. & other cerimonyes and lawes yat he yaue them that tyme wer̄ but a veyle hilynge gostly vnderstō¦dyng / vnder figures of thynges that were to come. And whanne tho thinges were fulfilled by the passion of Cryste / ye veyle & mys∣tihede of figures shulde be done awaye and cese. And in token therof in tyme of cristes passion. the veyle of the iewys temple to rent and cleef in ii. parties that men mighte se al the priuey thin¦ges that were in the temple / whi¦che were bifore hyd fro the sighte of the people by that veyle Also the same texte of the cōmaunde¦mente shewyth wele / that halo∣wynge in the saturday shulde be translatyd into the sunday / that is clepyd the day of the sonne. For al though god cesyd in the
saturday from makinge of thin¦ges of newe kynde / yit in the sa∣turday he made the saturday as he made eche day bifore in the sa¦me day But in the sonnedaye next folowyng he made no new day in kynde / for that was the firste day / and so he restyd more in the sunday from worchynge. thanne he dyd in the saturdaye. Also after greate trauayl owith to be more reste. But criste god∣des sonne hadde more trauayle in recreacion & redēpcion of mā∣kynde thanne he hadde to make al this worlde For in makynge of alle the worlde he hadde noo trauayle / as seynt austyn saith. but only he bad it shuld be done. and it was done anon what he wolde But in recreation & redēp¦cion of mankynde he traueyled so that he swat blode for anguis¦she / and dyed for trauayle & shed his herte blode / and cesyd nat of trauayl tyl in the morowe tyde of the sonne day whanne he rose from deth to lyf to comforte alle mankynde yt wolde leue in hym And he shewid openly than that he was and is lorde of al thing. And saide to his apostles. yt alle power in heuene and erthe was youen to him in his manhode. And therfore the sūday is clepyd the lordes day. Dies dominic{us}. And therfore sithen god wolde yt the saturday shulde be halowed in the olde lawe / for god ceasyd thanne from creacion / and so in maner beganne to rest / moch mo¦re he wole that the sonneday be halowyde in the newe lawe / for god cesyd than from ye grete tra¦ueyl of our redempcion and our saluacion and recreacion. The iiii chapter FIgure of this we haue al¦so in holy wrytt. Leuitici xxiiio. where we fynde that god badde the children of israel kepe principally vii feestes in the yer̄ of the whiche the laste was cle∣pyd. Festum tabernaculorum. The feest of tabernacles He bad theym take bowes & braunches of palme trees and of other trees the feyrest that they might fynd and make hem tabernacles and logges & duelle therin vii. daies to gidder / ī mynde that god ma∣de theym to duelle ī tabernacles & logges xl. yere in desert & there he sauyd them & kepte them and he hadde yt the firste day and the viii shulde be ful holy. By this feest of tabernacles yt came laste after ye other festes of the iewes ben vnderstonde the festes of ye newe lawe / whiche came laste in
the ende of the worlde. after the olde lawe. For alle the festes of the newe lawe been festes of ta∣bernacles For whāne god came to be man / he made firste his ta∣bernacle in the mayde mary whi¦che tabernacle was arayed. and dight with the fairest braūches and bowes of grace and vertues and of gode thewys. that might be foūde in any creature / for she passyd al creatures in grace and godenesse. Of this tabernacle spekith the prophete. p̄o. xviii. In sole posuit tabernaculū suū et ipse tan{quam} sponsus procedens de thalamo suo. He made his tabernacle in the sōne / that was our lady mayden and moder bri¦ghter thāne the sonne. He came oute of her as an husbonde oute of his chābre Another taberna∣cle god made him in oure māho∣de and in oure kynde / that was the blisful body. Whiche he toke of the mayden mary For as the tabernacles wer̄ made of the fai¦rest braunches and bowes thatt might be founde / so the body of cryste was made and gadryd to gydder of the clenest droppes of bloode that were in oure ladye. seynt mary clene mayden with∣outen spotte of synne In this ta¦bernacle god was boorne of the mayden on Cristmasse day. In this tabernacle he was circumci¦ded / worshipped of thre kinges. and duellyd with vs ī erth ī our pilgramage xxxii. yere & more.

The v. chapter DIues. Why bad god that we shulde thynke to ha∣lowe wele the holiday and the sa¦bot. Pauper. Ther is thre ma∣ner of sabottes / that is to say. of reste or of halowynge. Scilicet. pectoris temporis et eternitatis That is to say of reste of hert / of tyme / and of endelesse restynge. By reste of hert and of thought. men come to reste of tyme. And by reste of thought and of tyme. men come to endlesse reste. Soo withouten reste. of herte and of thoughte / may no man come to endelesse reste that the sabot and the holiday betokneth And ther¦fore god bad vs that we shulde principaly trauayle to haue sa∣bot & reste of herte and of thouʒt withoutē whiche rest & sabot we may nat wele halowe any holy∣day And therfore Cryste sayd in the gospel. yt out of the hert whā it is oute of reste / come wycked thoughtes māslaughters / auou¦tryes / lechery / theftes / false wyt¦nesses / dispyte of god. Mt xv.c. whiche synnes distroye charitie. & peas / and been causes of moch vnreste in this worlde / and lette reste of tyme / so that vnnethes. may any tyme be reste And ther∣fore god saith. thynke that thou halowe wele thyne holiday. Be thynke the if thou be in charitie and reste of herte with god & mā And if thou be stired ayēst thyn euyn cristen by wrath hate or en¦uye. or haue any heuy hert ayēst thy brother / go as god biddeth ī the gospel and be firste reconsey¦led to thy brother / & than come & make thyn offryng of holy pray¦er of thankynge of prisyng / and of thy giftes to god And butt thou do so and putte away alle rancour and heuy hert / elles thy halowynge and thy sabot is nat plesaunte to god Also bithenke
the if thou be ī dedly synne / and repente the & be shreuen assoone as thou might in gode maner / & so offre vp thy self to god by cha¦rite / and by sorowe of hert & ma¦ke thy self holy / and thāne arte thou able to halowe wele the ho¦liday For as longe as thou arte ī dedly synne by wyl or by dede. so longe thou halowest nat thy haliday For thou doste seruyle werke of synne / and doist dispy¦te to the haliday. Which is ordey¦ned that men shulde thāne amē¦de them / and serue god more spe¦cially thanne in the woke daye. And as longe as man or womā is in dedly synne / he serueth the deuyl and nat god to plesaunce Also god biddeth that mē shuld bethynke theim to halowe wele the haliday For in the halidaye namely on the sūday men shuld drawe their wittes to giddre frō the worlde and bethynke theym if they hadde oughte trespassed / that woke by recheleshede or by couetise / or by lechery / or any o∣ther wyse / and axe god foryeue¦nesse. Also thynke on the spede & benefices that god hathe sente theym that woke. or euyr bifore / and thanke hym therof. Thank him of his endeles mer∣cy / and his endelesse charite that he shewyd to mākynde Thynk hou he made mā to his owne lik¦nesse to be ayre and citezen of he¦uene. Thynke howe he made alle thynge for man. Thinke what blisse he hath ordeyned to man and woman if they do wel. What peyne if they doo euyl. The vi. chaptre. THerfore saith Origenes. su{per} Leuiticum xxviii.c. On the sunday thou shuldest do no worldly thinges / but oonly yeue the to god and gostly thin∣ges. Thanne saith he come to churche / ley thyne ere to goddes worde / thynke heuynly thinges thynke on the lyf that we hopen alle to haue in endlesse blisse. Thynke on the laste dome hou harde it shalbe and howe straite Take thanne none hede to this worlde ne to thynges visible. But on the haliday haue thy go stely iye principally to thinges. that ben to come / and yit ben in¦uisible. He that thus dothe saith he. halowith wele his halidaye. and he maketh ye sacrifice of ye sabott And therfore the lawe saith thus. We haue ordeyned yt alle sundaies be kepte with all maner worship from euyn to e∣uyn / and that mē absteyne hem from al maner vnleful werkes. that ther be no markette holden on the sonneday / ne plee / ne no
man dāpned to dethe / ne to pey¦ne. ne othe taken solemnely / but it be for peas or for some greate nede. Extra li.ii. ti. de feriis. Omnes dies dominicos. The lawe saith that men shuld nought do on sunday / but yeue theym to god / ne doo no seruyle werke. But that day shulde be occupied in prisynge & wor∣shipynge of god and in goostly songes. De con. di. iii. Ieiunia Mē shulde on the haliday serue god with hert mouth and werk. With herte. thynkynge as I ha¦ue saide / with mouthe wele spe∣kynge in prayer prisynge & wor¦shipynge of god / and gode īfor∣macion of their euen cristen. In werke also of dedes of almesse. ī peas makynge & accordynge of neighboures and suche other. But nowe alas is fulfilled that Ieremye saide. Treno{rum} .io.c. Viderunt eam hostes et derisetr̄ sabbata eius. The enemyes the feendes see mannys soule & womānes how it was defouled with synne on the haliday / and scornyd his halidaies and his sa¦botes For ye haliday was ordey¦ned in confusion of the feende & ī worship of god / & for saluacion of mannes soule / but nowe it is turned to shēship of mānys soul to dispite & offēce of god. & ī ple∣saunce of the fende. For in the sunday reigneth more lecherye. gloteny / manslaughter / robbe∣ry / bacbityng / {per}iury / & other syn¦nes / more than regnyd al the we¦ke bifore And whan men come to churche / they leeue bedys byd¦dynge / and spende their tyme in synfulianglynge. For there they caste gyle ayēst their euyn cristen There they holde their {per}∣vys of manye wronges. Whiche they thynke to do. And therfore god may say to theim yt he sayde to the iewys. It is writen saide he ye myn hous shalbe clepyd an hous of prayer / & ye haue made it a dēne of theues / ī ye that ye cō¦tryue her gyle & falshede / to rob∣be your euyn cristen of his gode of his right & of his fame. And therfore he sayth by the {pro}phete. Isaie i.c. My soule hatith your solēpnities & halidayes. They ben ful heuy to me / I haue tra∣ueil to suffre them But therfore sayth he / whan ye shal lyfte vp youre hōdes to me I shal turne myn iyen away from you. And whan ye multiply youre prayer to me I shalle nat here you / for youre hondes be fulle of blode yt ye haue shedde and fulle of syn. And youre cūpanyes and youre gadrynges to gydder been fulle wycked. Iniqui sunt cetus vti.
The vii. chapter. ALso leue frende god bade that men shulde thynk to halowe wele the holyday For mā and womā shuld so bethink them bifore ī the woke day and so ordeyne their occupacions / yt they shulde nat nede to breke the holiday. For if a man nedith to breke the holiday / and that nede come of his owne folye & of his misgouernaūce bifore / he is nat excused by that nede. Moche lesse thanne is he excused if that nede come of purpose and of co∣uetise. And therfore they yt wole nat go ne sende to market in the woke daye to bye their necessari¦es / but abyde tyl on the sunday. for sparyng of tyme / they be nat excused though tho thinges ben nedeful to them Men shulde stu¦dye and dispose hem as besily to serue god on the sunday. as they studie bifore to traueyl for them self on the woke day For god hath graunted vi. daies to man and woman for to traueyle for them self / and the seuynth daye. he hath reseruyd to his seruyce ¶We rede in holy wryt Numeri. xv.c. That a man wente in the sabot day and gaderyd styckes He was taken and ledde to moi¦ses / and he putt him in prison til he had an aunswere of god what he shulde do with him. God had moyses yt he shulde be ledde oute of goddes castelles yt were clepid the duellinges and tētys of god¦des folke / and there al the peple shulde stone him to the deth And so he was slayne spitefully / for he bithought him natt bifore to halow the haliday / for he might haue gadryd styckes in the day bifore And sithē he was so spyt∣fully slayne for gadering of styc¦kes to make therwith his fyre yt was nedeful to him Moch mo∣re shulde they be punisshed that on the sūday gadre to gidre brō∣des of synnes of couetyse. of le∣chery {per}iury. and bacbitynge / to brenne with their soules in helle withouten ende but they amēde them.

For he doth yt syn and therto he brekith ye haliday ayenst goddes precepte Also seruyle werke is clepyd eue¦ry bodily werk don prīcipali for

DIues. Why bad god that bothe man & beeste shulde reste and halowe on the holiday Pauper. For as salomō saith. Sap̄. vi. & xi.c. God loueth al thinge that he made / & hath cure of alle thinges that he made. And therfore he ordeyned reste ī ye holidaies nat only for his ow¦ne worship and for gostly helpe of soule / but also for bodily help bothe of man and beste But the couetise of man were refreyned. by reste on the holiday he shulde neuir reste / But with trauail sle him self / his seruaūtis his sub¦gettes / and his bestes And ther∣fore both to saue man and beest and for grete {pro}fyte of man / god bad reste on the holiday For bo∣the man and beste nedith rest aft{er} trauayle / and shalle be the more freysshe al the woke after to tra∣uayle if they haue rest on the ho¦lyday And therfore it fallith oft that they which wole nat rest on the sundaye / been made to reste al ye woke aft{er} / either for seknes that they fal in by ouir trauayl. or by sekenes / or by feblenes of their seruaūtes / and of their bees¦tes / or elles by deth. For often they sle their bestes by ouir mo∣che trauayle / and contynuynge of trauayl And therfore in the be¦gynnynge of the worlde whāne Adam synned in the sixte daye. by etynge of appyl ayenst god∣des forbode. And that god hadde dampnyd him and al his to perpetuel trauayl for his syn After this of his greate and endelesse mercy he tempryd and
slakyd his harde dome / and or∣deyned reste bothe to man & best in the seuynth day And therfore saith holy wrytt Gen̄ ii.c. That god fulfillyde his werkes in the vii daye / nat only for he maade than the vii day & cesyd of crea∣cion / but also principally for he shewyd thanne first mercy ayēst synne grauntynge and bidding reste in the vii. day both to man & to beste whiche he dampned in the day bifore to {per}petuel traueil for adams synne / whiche mercy was fulfyllyng and {per}fection of al his werkes Quia miseratōes eius su{per} oīa o{per}a eius. For as dauyd saith goddes mercyes bē aboue al his werkes. And seynt Iames saith. Mercy enhaūsith rightful dome And but god had endyd his werkes in mercy in ye vii. day / and slakyde his harde dome ayenste mankynde for A∣dams syn / elles his werkes had nat been complete ne parfyte / in asmoche as the principal creatu¦re for whome he made al thinge was loste.

For this mercy that god shewyd to man whāne be ordeyned rest in the vii· day that was clepyde sabott. figure of endlesse reste of mankynde Crist saith in the gos¦pel. that the sabot was made for man / nat mā for the sabbotte. Mar. ii.c. But synful man is so blent with couetise / yt he turneth his dampnation and his peyne. into likynge / and hath leuyr to trauayle to his vndoynge. and vnto his dampnacion / than to reste to his saluation And hathe leuir to folowe the harde sentēce of god to his punysshyng / thāne to take his grace and his mercy. to be esyd Suche ben lyke oules & backes / whiche hate the day & loue the night / lyke to the feen∣des of helle that neuir haue reste ne for malice wole seke reste.

The firste precepte of charite is this / yt thou shalt loue thy lorde god with al thyn herte / with all thy soule. With al thy mynde / wt al thy might. Whanne he saith thou shalt loue thy god with al thyne herte / he excludeth al ma¦ner of ydolatrie / that is for forfē¦dyd by the firste cōmaundmēte. that no man set his herte / ne his feyth ne his truste in no creatur̄ more than in god / ne ayenst god¦des worshippe. For who so loueth wele another / he hathe kyndly a trust and a feith in him And after that he loueth. so he trustith And ther̄ he trustiy moste / comōly he loueth moste. And therfore god badde yt thou shuldest loue him with al thyne herte / yt is to say wt al thy feithe so that thou sett al thy feith and thy truste in him bifore al other as in him that is almightye and may best helpe at nede And ther∣fore the firste p̄cepte of thies iii. is applied prīcipaly to ye fad{er} al¦mighty.

Wt al oure werkes. And so the first p̄cept of the firste table techith vs to loue god with alle oure herte The se¦counde techith vs to loue hī wt alle oure worde / and shewe hym loue ī speche For who so loueth wele a nother / he wole speke go∣de and worship of him that he lo¦ueth / and be glade to here of his gode name and speke him gode. & worship / and sorye to here his name dispised and diffamed By ye thrid cōmaundmente we ben taught to shewe loue to god ī dede / yt is to leue oure owne oc∣cupacions on ye haliday & yeue vs prīcipaly to serue god & to be occupied wt hī / & no thīg do but for his loue & to his worship / or for grete nede of oure self For who so loueth wele a nother / he wole seke a tyme to speke wt hī. & dele wt hī And therfore god bid¦deth vs halowe wel the haliday & than attēde to hī & occupie vs wt hī as wt oure dere loue / yt ma¦de vs of nought / and bought vs with his blode ful dere / & saueth
vs / and kepith vs / and yeuethe vs al that we haue of any gode and fyndeth vs alle that vs ne∣dith and moche more And if we loue him in this maner with all oure mightes and oure dedys / & oure werkes / and halowe thus the haliday & the sabot yt he hath boden vs halowe / He shulde ye∣ue vs a sabot and reste in heuen blisse / where as saith ysaie the {pro}¦phete. shalbe sabott of sabottes. that is to say endlesse rest betok nyd by temporel rest in the hali∣daye.

Thanne some of her briddes for loue and pitee put theym to traueyle and fede their moder / & some yeue no tale of her but on∣ly fede theym self.

For the wise man saith Qui honorat prēm suū io cūda∣bitur in filiis suis Eccle. iii.c. He ye worshipeth his fader shalle haue ioye of his children. And who so worshipeth nat his fader & moder in this maner / but doth them wrath and tene by his mis¦lyuynge and euyl taches / he is a cursyd of god Maledictus qui non honorat patrē suū et matrē suā.

Eccle. iii.c. It is grete vilonye to fader and moder whanne mē curse them and deprayue theym for wyckednesse of their childrē And therfore the wise mā saithe. Non iocunderis in filiis impiis Haue thou no ioye ne likyng in thy children if they be shrewys & drede nat god It is better sayth he to haue one gode childe / than a thousande children shrewys / & better to dye withoutē / thāne to leue after them shrewyd childrē. Eccle. xvi. c. For as he saythe. Sapīe. iiii. c. Alle the children yt come of wycked folke shalle be wytnesses of wyckednesse ayēst their fader and moder / whanne they shalbe chalengyde of theire wyckydnesse at the dome For the fader and the moder shal aū¦swere thāne for their owne wyc¦kednesse / and for their children wyckednesse But the wise man saith / if thou haue children tech theym wele / and bowe them and make them souple and meke in their youthe. If thou haue dou∣ghters. kepe wele their bodies & honestly / but shewe them no gla¦de chere / be nat to homely withe them Eccle. vii.c. While a tree is a smalle sprynge it may be bo¦wyd as men wole haue it Butt whanne it is ful woxen / it wole nat be bowyd So may the child in the youghe wt a lytel twygge be chastised and made lowe and meke But whāne he is woxen & rotyd in pride and mysuse of ly∣uynge / it is ful harde to lowe hī or to amende him. And therfore the wise man sayth. Qui parcit virge odit filiū: et qui diligit il∣lū instāter erudit Prouer. xiii.c. He that sparith the yerde hatith his sonne / and he that loueth his sonne techith him and chastifeth him bisily. Example we haue in kynde of the egle. Which of al foules may se ferthest / and is mi¦ghtiest in sight / in somoche that he may se & loke ayenst the sōne whanne it shyneth moste bright without blemysshyng of the iye. And whanne she hath briddes & they be ful woxen / she doth hem loke ayenst the sonne And tho ye loke wele ayenst the sonne with oute blemysshynge of iye / them she loueth and cherissheth. And them that wole nat ne may nat loke ayenst the sōne / or blemissh their iye in lokynge ayenste the sōne / she betith them and bylleth them. And but if they amende them / she castith them out of the neste / and putteth theim oute of her cumpany as for noon of her briddes. Thus shulde faders and moders teche their children. to haue their iye vp to god / that

Tobie. iiii.c. And therfor salomon sayth. Eccle. vi. That the wicked man that loketh not vp to the sunne of rightwisnesse is so blent with derkenesse of sin¦ne / that he woot not what is go¦de: ne what is wicked / And ther¦fore sayth he in the next chapter wisdom with richessis is more {pro}¦fitable than with oute richessys: & it profith most to them that se¦the sunne. that is to say to them that haue iye to the sūne of right wisnesse. that is god / For as sa∣lomon sayth.

Sict oculi seruorum in manibus dn̄o rum fuorum et sicut oculi ancil∣le in manibus domine sue: ita o culi nostri ad dominum deū nos¦trum donec misereatur nostri. As the seruantys haue ther iyen to the handes of ther lorde: and as the mayde in chaumbre hath hyriyen to the handys of hyr la∣dy: So muste vs haue oure iyen vp to oure lorde god til he wyll haue mercy on vs. The eleuenth chapter DIues.

For it is good reson that they lyue longe: why∣th maynteyn wel theym that be beginnynge of ther lyfe: that is fader and moder / For whanne the rote of the tre faylethe by de∣faute of the tre aboue thanne ye tre shal sone fayle and sere vp. And it is not worthy that he liue lōg ne farewel that worshipeth not them ne helpe them: by whō he lyueth: and hath his lyfe and hys welfare / And he that wor∣shipeth not the begynning of his his beynge: is worthisone to lese hys beinge / And he that helpeth other withe hys good to lyue longe good life: is worthy to haue good and good lyfe.

gostly man slaughtyr and dedly synne? Pau{per}. Nay. For flate∣ring is a speche of veyn praysīg sayde to man or woman with in¦tencion to plese them / And that maye be do in three maners: as praysing man or woman ī good¦nesse and in good that he hathe. Or els praysinge them in good∣nesse and good yt they haue not. Or els praising them in threw id¦nesse and falsnesse: of which ma¦ner flatering speketh dauid and sayth. Qn̄i laudatur peccator in desideriis anime sue et iniquus benedicetur / Forsoth sayth he ye synner is praisid in desiris of his soule: and ye wicked man is bles¦sed of folys / For whanne shrew∣is haue forth ther wyl in shrewed¦nesse: thanne the world praiseth them and worshyp theym / The firste maner of praisynge if it be do only to plese man & not god: it is synne. and in cas dedly syn∣ne / And therfor saint poule saith that if he wold only plese man & not god: he were not cristys ser∣uaunt / But it be do to plese god and for a good ende it is cōmen∣dable and medful / For in good folke vertue ye is praised wexeth Virt{us} laudatur crescit / Butt this maner praysinge is no flatering The secunde maner of praysing if it be do for god and for a good ende it is sufferable: & in cas cō∣mendable and medeful / But if be do wetingly: only to plese mā and not god. it is dedly synne. The thyrd maner of praysynge if it be do wyllynge and wetyng it is dedly sinne And therfore da¦uid sayde. Oleum pccōris non ī pinguet caput meū. Lord god sayth. lete not the oyle of ye synner make fatte my hede ye si say. late my herte neuer haue no lykynge ne ioye in false flaterīg For as saint austen saith ye tūg of ye flaterer do more harme yan the swerde of the enmye pursuīg Therfore salomon saythe: it is better to be vnder nomen of the wyse man: than he deseyued by flaterīg of folis. eccle. viio.

For by cause of ther slaterynge they youen no tale of me: ne dre∣ded me: ne worship me / For an handful of barly sayth be & for a go bet of brede they slowe soulis that were not dede: and they q̄c∣kened soulys that lyued not ma¦kynge lesingys to my peple that loued lesingys / And they confor¦ted synners in ther synne and in ther falsnesse: and dyconforted good folke in ther goodnes and in ther truth.

Therfore god lycknethe flate∣rers to them that playstren & pal¦ten wallis and wowys with out For thinge that is foule thei ma¦ke it to seme fayre and make fol¦ke to haue lyking ī ther synnes. Therfore god sayth that the sin¦ner maketh the wal of synne by¦twene hym and god. But flate∣rers playsteren and paynten the wal of synne. Eze. xiiio:c. Al so flaterers be lickened to an adder that is cleped dipsa which as the master of kindes sayth. lio xviiio he is so litel yt thow a man trede theron he mai not se it But hys venī is so violent that it sleethe

Whiche is leest of al edders: and yet his venym is not curable as sayth the mayster of kynd in the same place / Right so flaterynge semeth but a ful lytyl synne and yet it is so venemous that it wyl not be lightly helyd / For whāne man or woman hath lykinge in flateringe and rewlethe hys lyfe after flateryng tunge: it is full harde to that man or woman to be saued / For as longe as men preysen him in his synne: so son¦ge he is bolde in hys synne / And if men begynne to lacke him: he falleth into sorowe and dispey∣re / Therfore saint iames sayth that the tunge is but a lityl mem¦bre: and reyseth vp grate desese it is a wickid thing that hath no rest ful of dedly venym. iac.iii.c. And the prophete dauid saythe. Acuerunt linguas suas sicut ser¦pentes: venenum aspidum sub¦sabiis eorum / They haue shar∣ped ther tungys as addris: the v∣nym of addyrs is vnder the lyp∣pes of flaterers and wicked spe∣kers / And if a man do his dedys only for to be preysed & flatered of the people: flaterynge is hys mede / And whanne flaterynge ceseth and the wynde turnethe a yens him he hath no lenger likīg in good dedys / and so as the gos¦pel saythe. for that he seketh thā¦ke in preysinge only of man for hys good dedys and not of god: therfore al suche be lyckened to the fyue maydens folys ye wolde mete with ther husbond criste ie∣su at the dome with lampis with¦outen oyle / That is to say with good dedis with oute gostli mer∣the and ioye and conscience For they hadde no ioy in ther goode dedys: but in preysing and flate¦ringe of the people / And therfor criste sayth in the gospel they ha¦ue take ther mede in this worlde and at the dome they shalbe shet oute of heuen blisse from endles mede bothe flaterers and they ye haue lykynge in flaterynge and do ther dedys only for flateryng and preysing of the people / But the fiue wys maydens as sayth the gospel hadden oyle ī ther laū¦pis that is to say gostly ioy and lykīg ī ther good dedys And ther¦fore they shal be receyued of ther hushōd crist into the blesse wyth outen ende / And as saint austen saith in hys sermon bi oyle is vn¦derstonde both gostly praysyng ¶and worldly praysynge
and myrthe. Gostly preysyng & gostly myrthes is cleped the oile of the holy gooste / But worldly preysing and worldly merthe is cleped the oyle of synners / And therfore he saythe that flaterers selle oyle to the maydens folys that is to saye to synners as ofte as they flater theym and preyse them in ther foly and in ther pry¦de for to haue mete or drinke or money or worship. or any tem∣poral lucre. & so bringe thē in er¦rour & foly & plese & praise theim in ther synne / But as dauid say¦th.

Eccle. xxviii.c. that who so taketh bede to the flaterynge tunge. that is the thirde tung: to haue lykinge therin: he shal ne∣uer haue reste / And he shal haue no frende in whom he may reste ne trust / For flaterers be no true frendys: but alle blinde so men ye thei mai not knowe ther frendis ne take hede to the speche of ther frēdys that wold say them the so¦th & warne theym of ther harme. The fifth chapter. DIues.

Pauper. Thys argumente is grounded in two false maxyms First that euery punisshyng and vengeaunce assigned of god for mannys synne and womans is assigned after yt the synne is mor or lesse / And this maxime & groū¦de is fals / wherfor thou shalt vn¦derstond that god punisshe some synnes in this worlde: and some in the other worlde: sūme bothe here and there In the other worl∣de he punyssheth euery synne af∣ter yt it is more greuous / or lesse greuous / But in this worlde he doth not alwey so / But oft ī this world he punyssheth the les syn∣ne harder: than he doth the more synne / Therfore in the old lawe auoutre was punysshed as hard or harder than manslaughter: & yit māslaughter is more gruous synne than auoutrie And god to¦ke more temporal vēgeaunce in this world for lecherie. than euer he dyd for ydolatrie. And yit ydo¦latrie is gretter synne than leche¦rie: for it is īmediat ayens god & ayens the first precept of the first table / And manslaughter is har∣der punysshed in thys worde thā periurie / And yit periurie is gret∣ter synne: as I sayde in the secū∣de cōmaundement / And synnes in symple pore folk be harder pu¦nisshed in this worlde / than syn∣nes of the gret mē / If a pore mā stele an horse: he shal be hanged But if a lorde by raueyn and ex¦torsions robbe a man of al that he hath: he shal not be hanged ne lityl or nought punisshed in this world / Dauid did auou∣tre and manslaughter for which synnes he was worthi to be slay¦ne by comon lawe of god / & yit god wold not haue him slain but if apore man had do tho synnes he shulde haue be slayne / A sym∣ple mā went & gadered styckes ī the sabot: & god bad moyses sto∣ne him to deth.

Cursed be the erth in thy werke & in thy synne / He sayd not cursed be the erth in thy werke of eue ne he sayde not cursed be the erth in youre werke: as for comon syn∣ne of them bothe: but he sayd on¦ly to adam / Cursed be theerth in thy wrke / In punysshynge also of the serpent he yaue hys curs: & sayd / Thou shalt be cursed amō¦ges al thynge lyuynge vpon er∣the / Also god cursed caym whan he punysshed hym for sleynge of hys brother Abel / But whanne god punysshed woman / he yaue not hys curse / And we rede not yt euer god yaue hys cursse to any woman openly ī special / Ne god repreued not eue so moche: as he dyd adam / And so the gret rep̄efe & blamīg & the curs that god ya∣ue in punysshyng of adam more than he dyd in punisshing of eue sheweyng wel yt the synne of adā was more greuous than was ye synne of eue / and that there was more obstynacye in adam than was eue / For cursyng is not yo∣uen of god ne of holy church but for obstinacie / As I sayde fyrste adam answerde full obstynatly / God blamed adam pryncypaly for brekynge of hys cōmaunde∣ment and sayde to hym that bre∣kyng of his cōmaundemēt was cause of his nakednesse & of hys sodeyn myschefe: and not wyth∣stondynge the techynge / and the styrynge of god: he wolde not be aknowe of his senne: but put his synne on god: and excused hym by eue: and so put synne to sinne in excusacion of his synne. Whanne god punisshed adam he cursed the erth for his synne / whi¦che curse turned to woo and tra∣ueyle of him & of all mankynde which we may not fle / And ther∣fore he sayd to adam. thou shalt ete of the erth in trauaile & sorow alle the dayes of thy lyfe / I shal brīg the forth breris and thornes and thou shalt ete erbis of the er∣the / Also in punysshīge of adam god yaue the sētence of deth vp∣on hī & al mākīde for his synne: & therfor god siad to adam thou shalt ete thi bred ī swīk & swet of thy face til thou torne ayen into the erthe For erthe thou arte ¶:and into erthe ayen thou
shalt wende / Syth thanne god for synne of adam yaue soo gre∣uously hys curse: and blamed so harde adam of his synne: and for his synne dampned hym and all mankynde: and punisshed al er∣thely creaturis for his sīne & dāp¦ned him and al mankynd to per∣tuel traueyle whanne he sayde. thou shalt ete thy mete with tra∣ueyle and sorowe al the daies of thy lyfe / And also for the synne of adam he yaue sentēce of deth: to him and to al mankynd that is moste of al peynes: it folowe∣the that god punysshed harder a∣dam for his synne: than he dyde eue for hir synne / For why in pu∣nisshyng of eue god repreued hir not so moch as he did adam And he yaue thanne no curse ne peyn perpetuel safe subiection: I shal sayde god multiplie thy mysche∣ues and thy conseyuyngys: and in sorow thou shalt bere thy chil∣dren: & thou shalt be vnder pow∣er of man: hnd he shal be thy lord God seyde not to womā: I shal multiplie thy thy myscheues all dayes of thy lyfe / For she maye kepe hir chaste if she wyl and fle mischefe and peyne of chyldren byrthe / And that god made wo∣man subget to man for the syn∣ne of eue: is was no newe thyng to woman For as sayth saīt aus¦ten su{per} gen̄. lio xio.co xiiii. womā was subget to man bifore by or¦dre of kynde: but that subiectōn was only by loue and charytye but for hyr synne she was made subget: not only by loue: but al∣so by nede and bondage of onest seruyle werke to obeye to man & be vnder his gouernaunce / By∣fore hir synne she was subgett to man only by loue / But after hir sinne she was mad subget to mā not only bi loue but by drede and by nede For she most drede man & she hath nede of his helpe / For that was the pryde of adam and of eue: that they desired to haue no soueraigne ne gouernour but god alone as clerkis sey And therfore the fend in gyle by hight thē yt they desired saiyng to eue if ye ete of ye tree yt god hathe for∣bode you: ye shal be as goddes knowynge good and euyl: that is to saye: ye shal nede no soue∣raigne ne gounoure to tech you ne to gouerne you but god / And for yt they desyred it lightly they leuyd it / For as sayth the mayst of storyes: Thynge that is desi∣red: lyghtly it is beleued And therfore god rightful iuge punis¦shed theym bothe in subiection of drede and of nede: and of har∣de seruage He made woman sub ¶get to man / and aftwarde

For though woman be in thraldome to temporal lordis as be men. that is not for the syn¦ne of eue: but prīcipaly for ye sin¦ne of adam / The subiectōn that womā is put ī for the synne of e∣ue: is the subiection that the wif owethe to hir husbond / And alle the soueraygntie and lordshyp yt any man hath here in this world eyther ouer man or woman: it is medled with moch woo and gret sorowe and care / For euery soue¦raigne in thys world moste care for his subgettys: if he be wyse. And in higher degre that he be of lordshyp and of dignitye: in the higher degre is he of perel of dre∣de of sorowe and care in punissh∣ing of adms synne: And so bothe lordship in this worlde: & subiec∣cion be punisshed of adams syn∣ne / And if subgettis can haue pa¦cience with ther degre. they be in more sikernes both of body and of soule / and in more gladnes of hert thā be the souereignes / And so punysshed god adam as moch in maner: in that he made hī lor∣de and gouernour of woman as he punysshed eue: whāne he ma∣de hir subget to adam / For in ye god bonde man to haue cure of wooman I hyr mischeefe to saue hir and to kepe hir: that was by comon soo feynte: soo feble and freel: and so mischeuous by cau∣se of hir synne. The xxv. chapter. DIues. yet clerkys ergue ayens the and sey that wo¦man synned more greuously thā adam: for she put hirsilfe ī synne and hir husbond adam / Butte a¦dam put only himsilfe in synne. Pauper. This skill is nought For as I said first adā was shēt withe preuy pryde and welth of himsilfe and felle into synne or eue profered hym the apple / Also saith saint Austē de cī. dī. lo.xiiiio co.xio. Adam wyste wele that it was a greuous synne / But eue was soo deseyued that she wend that it had be no synne / And ther¦fore the synne that she dyd by ig∣norance and deseyte of the fende excuseth not: ne lessethe nott the synne of Adam that he dyd wyl∣lynge and wyttyngly. Adā was hir soueraigne and shulde haue gouerned them bothe: and not o¦beied to ye voice of his wif ayēs
the voyce of god that forbad hī the tre Example if a symple mā be vnkunnyng and by deseyt of sum shrew do a foly wening not to do amys: and he come to his prelate or his busshop and coun¦seyle him to do the same: and his prelate or his busshop do the sa∣me wetynge wel that he doth a∣mys: and that it is a greuous sī∣ne: euery man wyl deme that ye busshop and his prelate synneth more greuously than the symple man that wend not to do amysse And thus nigh al circumstaun∣cys that agreggen any synne a∣gregged the synne of adam mo∣re than the synne of eue / For he was soueraigne and perfit more in kynde wyser and myghtier to withstonde the fendes fodynge / And with lesse temptacion fel in synne and brake goddes cōmaū¦demente wytyngly / But eue by deseyte of the adder synned by ig¦norance. as saythe saynt austē. v. su {pro}xīo. & sidor{us} de sū. bono lio.iio.

Where the glose sayth that they that synne by ignorance may li∣ghtly haue foryeuenesse. but he yt doth it wetyngly ayens the ma∣iestie of god ayens his conscien∣ce: he is worthy no foryeuenesse Also adam was more obstynat than eue was. Diues. Shewe me that Pauper. For god bla∣med hym firste of al: and decla∣red to him his synne: and god a∣bode of punysshyng tyl he hadde vndernome eue: and after eue ye fende ī the adder: and fyrst he pu¦nisshed ye adder & thā eue yt adā shuld haue beware & axed mercy And so god blamed him first and punisshed him last: so yeuyng hī respite of repentaunce: But for al this adam repented hym non ne wolde axe mercy ne lowne hī Firste god punisshed him fro fe in the adder in that he cursed the adder that was his suget & made the adder enmye to hys wife and to hir sede: that is to seye to ther children that she shuld gett of a∣dam / & so god made the adder yt was bifore suget & meke to him rebel & enemye to his loue yt was his wife & to al yt shulde come of thē two / yit adā stode abstinat. Thā god punisshed eue his wife his loue his help: & so punisshed him in Eue / For if he loued hyr
so moch as clerkes sey. it shulde haue be to him ful greate payne to se his wyfe his loue so punissh¦ed / For as clerkes seye. the grete loue that he hadde to eue: made him to breke the cōmaundemēt of god / And yit these dayes it is ful greate payne to kynde folke trewe in loue to se ther loue: and ther frendis in sorow and desese. Also god punysshed adam & eue. in that he punisshed hir with mis¦cheues of sykenesse. freeltie and feblenesse / For in so moche god toke from him his help that was woman made to be mannis hel∣pe / But the more feble that god made hyr for synne: the lesse she might helpe man / Also god pu∣nisshed theym bothe anon as A∣dam ete of the tre: and made thē so naked and so vnoneste yt they were ashamed of themsilfe whi∣che peyne fel not too adam ne to eue tyl adam hadde ete of the ap¦ple / And not withstondyng alle thys: yit adam stode obstynat & axed no mercyne knowleged no synne And thanne god rightful iuge punysshed him ful herde / bothe in thys worlde and in the other worlde and punissh∣ed al mankynd for his synne as sayth saynte Poule and saynte Austē and other doctouris / God punysshed adam and mankynd ful harde for his synne: whanne he toke moche of his lordship a∣wey from hym: and made nighe al creaturis rebelle to hym: and brought hym so lowe in ordre of kynd that though by wey of kin¦de man byfore adams synne pas¦sed woman in vertue and perfec¦cion of kynde Nowe after adās synne woman ofte tyme passeth many men in uertue and discre∣cion: and in other gyftis both of kynde and of grace / And byfore the synne of adam: man was so souereyne to woman: that wo∣man shulde not haue be hys so∣uereyne / But nowe for adamis synne of tyme mā is suget to wo¦man as to hys lady by bondage and thraldome: by hard feruage by nede: and drede: and owethe more seruage and subiection to woman for adamys synne: than doth woman to man for ye syn∣ne of eue / For god made womā for the synne of eue only subgett to hir husbond in seruice of onest werke as felawe notte as chorle in velenye werke of wordly bon¦dage. Also man for the synne of adam is ordeyned too many more perelys bothe on lond and on water & too werre / and too wo. and besynesse of thys worl∣de and to moche traueyle: and ¶manye perelys

If a man or womā selle a thing for gode and he knowe a defaut therin by whiche defaute the bier is disceiued / he doth gile & thefte Also and if the bier begile soo the seller. And therfore god seyde to the false iewys. Argentū tuū ver¦sū ē in scoriam / et vinū tuū mix∣tū est aqua Thy siluer is turned into drosse of siluer and into fals metal  and thy wyne is medlyde with water. ysa. io And therfo they that begile folke with false money wyttyngly / do grete syn. and perilous theft Also if he selle wyttyngly by fals measure / and by false weightes And therfore god saith thou shalt nat haue dy¦uerse weightes more and lesse / to bye by the more / and selle by the lesse. Ne thou shalt nat haue a more busshel and a lesse busshell. ne none other fals diuerse mesut But thou shalt haue iuste weiʒt and true and euen busshel & true. that thou may lyue longe in the londe that god shalle yeue the God hatith that man that dothe suche gyle / and he hatith al ma∣ner of vnrightfulnesse. Deutro. xxv. Also if man or woman sell seke thing for an hole thing wit∣tyngly to begile the bier / he doth theft / and is bounde to restituci∣on. And though he knowe nat ye defaute / whan he sellith it / whan he knowith yat defaut he is boū¦den to make sūme recōpēsacion. as saith the same clerk in the sa∣me boke and place. q̄. xi. Also if the seller sel a better thynge than he wenyth to selle in grete dāma¦ge of him self / as if he selle golde for latō. or if he sel a gode thing for a smalle price / wenyng that it were litel worth if he be moche harmyd therby / the bier is boūde to restitucion or recompēsacion. Diues. Is the seller holden to tel the bier the defautes of a thīg that he sellith Pauper. If the defautes be preuy and {per}ilous / he is holden to telle them to the bier and selle that thing better chepe. For if he sel an haltyng hors for a swyft hors / and a ruyno{us} hous for a stronge hous / it is {per}ilouse. and harme. to the bier / and he is bounde to restitucion But if the
defaute be open / and thoughe it may nat serue ye seller it may ser¦ue the byer / thanne it nedith nat the feller to tell the defautes but he is boūde to selle it for the lesse prise. Diues. May a man selle a thing a derrer thāne he bought it. to Pauper. Elles mighte no man lyue by his marchaūdise ne by his craft He must take vp his costes and susteyne him and his by measure and worship god and holy churche / and helpe the pore nedy after his estate And for this ende it is leful and nede∣ful to the chapmā & to the werk∣man to selle thynge derrer thāne he bought it. to And therfore seīt Poule saith. that no man is hol¦den to trauayle on his owne cos∣tes for the comynute / neither in knighthode ne in chapmanhode ne in werkmanship. And they yt with false othes / and lesynges / & slye speche begile folke in byeng and sellynge / synne greuouslye. & be holden to restitucion / if they begile so folke wyttyngnly. Diues. If ii. {per}sones betake the thridde {per}sone a thing to kepe by couenaunt that he shal nat deli∣uer it but to them bothe to gider. is he bounde to kepe couenaunt Pau{per}. yhe forsothe. Diues. And what if he deliuer it to oone of them in absence of the other / & withouten his wyttyng Pau{per}. He dothe amys / and yitt neither of hem hath lauful accion ayēst him for to compelle him to yelde it. For he that resceyued it ayen hath none accion to hym / for he toke it him ayen. And the other. hath none accion ayēst him / for he is nat bounde to him withou∣ten the other that made the coue¦nant with him / and hath rescey∣ued it ayen. Thus saith Hostiē∣sis in sū. li.iii. Rubrica de depo∣sito. S. cui detur. v. si vero. The xi. chapter. DIues. May nat a mā do almesse of euyl gotē gode Pau{per}. Salomon saith. Immo lantis ex iniquo: oblacio est ma∣culata. The offrynge of him yt offceth of euyl gotē gode / is spot¦tyd and foule in goddes sighte And he that offreth sacrifice of ye pore mannes gode / is lyke him. that sleeth the sonne in the sight of his fader. And god that is highest approueth nat the yiftes of the wicked mē / ne takith hede to their offrynge. Eccle. xxiiii. And therfore Salomon saithe Honora deum de tua substācia. Worship thy lord god with thyne owne gode / nat of other mennes

God biddeth in the gos∣pel that men shulde make theim frendes in the blisse of heuyne of richesses of wickednesse / Facite vobis amicos de māmona iniq∣tatis. Therfore it semyth yat it is leful to do almes of euyl go¦ten godes Pauper. In thre ma¦ners a thing may be euyl goten / For sūtyme it is so mys goten yt it must be yolden ayen to him yt oweth it / as in thefte / raueyne / & vsurie if he may be founde. And so of mys goten gode men shuld do none almesse / but yelde it ayē Also a thing is mys goten whan bothe yeuyng and taking of the thyng is ayenst goddes lawe / & both the yeuer and the taker lese their right / as in symonye. And therfore neither they may do ple¦saūt almesse of that gode so mys goten. Also a thynge is mys goten / whanne the dede and the crafte that it is goten by is so vn¦leful that the taker may kepe it stylle lefully / but the yeuer may nat axe it ayen / as thinge goten by licherye and by synful iapery of irregulers of mynstralles wit¦ches / and suche other. Which ma¦ner wynnyng is clepid foule wī∣nyng. that is Turpe lucrū in la∣tyne. And of suche euyl goten gode they may do none almesse. But they shulde make no open offrynge at the auter ne sacrifice of so mys goten gode. And ther∣fore god saith. Non offeres mer∣cedē {pro}stibuli in domo dn̄i dei tui quia abhominatio ē apud deum Thou shalt nat offre ye mede of the woman a comen lechoure in the house. of thy lorde god / for it is abhominacion to god. Deu¦tro. xxiii. And officers of kin∣ges princes lordes and ladies of busshoppes and prelates / yt take yiftes of men by comyn custome or by {pro}fre / that they shuld mayn¦tene them and yeue them fauour in their causes / they may doo al∣mes of godes so gotē / al though it be ful ofte euyl goten .xiiii. q̄. v. non sane. For to suche Cryste bad that they shulde make them frendes in heuene / of richesses of wyckednesse / that is to say of ri∣chesses so mys goten For he that taketh it hath noo righte therto. Diues. Why praysed Crist in ye gospel the false baily that so for yaue men their dett / in fraude of his lorde / to haue thanke of hem and helpe at nede. For he forya∣ue one the halfdele his dett / A no¦ther the fifte parte of his dette. Pau{per}. Crist prised nat the fals
ale. Butt Cryste saith that his lorde praised him nat for his fraude but for his slighte that he dyd in helpe of him self ne Criste tellith nat that parable in the go¦spel / that men shulde take exam¦ple of his fraude. to helpe theym self by fraude of robbere of other mennys gode / but to teche mē to make theym frendes by dedes of mercy and of almesse / and forye¦ue other men their dettes as they wole that god foryeue them ther dettes and make them frēdes / in heuene wt richesses of this world Diues. Why clepyd Crist riches¦ses of this world richesses of wic¦kednesse Pau{per}. For they been to moche folke occasion of mo∣che wyckednesse. and moche dis∣ease of hate / wrath / enuye / of de¦bate of plee and of grete discensi¦on And it is ful harde to gete thē or to kepe them withoutē synne. and grete disease And therfore seint Poule saythe that they yat coueyte to be riche in this world. fal in the feendes snare. And the wiseman saith if thou be riche in this worlde / thou shalt nat be vn¦giltie ne cleen from synne. Alsoo leue frende ye shal vnderstonde. that wyckednesse in holy wrytte is taken nat only for synne / but also for peyne and disease & mys∣cheuys of this worlde And so go¦des of this worlde been clepyd ri∣chesses of wyckednesse / that is to say of peyne. and disease. and of mischeif For they bringe men in to peyne trauayle and moche dis¦ease / for men haue moch trauail in gettynge / moche drede in ke∣pynge / and moche sorowe in the lesyng. Diues diuicias non con¦gregat abs{que} labore. Non tenet absʐ metu / nec deserit absʐ dolor They hote sikernesse and bryng folke into grete perel / grete drede and in grete enemyte They hote a man to haue his lust & lykyng and brynge him in endlesse hun∣gre For as salomon saith the co∣uetouse mā hath neuir ynoughe Auarus non impletur pecunia. but alway couetith more & mo Also they biete a man ease & rest and bring him in moche trauail. for nigh alle the traueyle of this worlde is to gete gode. Another skylle ther is why they been cle∣pyd richesses of wickednesse For the lawe saith .x. q̄. i. dilectissimi by wey of kynde alle men ben e∣uyn in lordeshippe and richesses. but by wyckednesse of false coue¦tise in the people men ben vneuē ī riches For sūme haue moche. so¦me litel / sūme ben riche sūme ben pore / and god hath youen more richesse to one man in dispensaci¦on and gouernaunce / thanne to
many other. And yt is to refreyne the wyckednesse o false couetise. in the peple And for wyckednes is cause that oone man is richer thanne a nother / therfore they be clepyd richesses of wyckednesse. For ne hadde be the wyckednes of Adames synne / and of fals co¦uetise of mannes herte / elles alle men shulde haue been euynly ri∣che. But nowe they ben vneuyn in richesse for synne and shrewid¦nesse / and therfore godes of this worlde ben clepyd richesses of vn¦euenes and of wyckednesse. ini∣quitatis id est non equitatis. And therfore alle the richesses yt one man hath passinge another. it is richesses of vneuenesse. For in yat he is vneuyn with his euē cristen. therfore they ben clepyde richesses of vneuynesse. Ther∣fore god biddeth the riche men yt been but his baillies and his Re¦ues in this worlde make frendes of the pore folke / bothe by yeuīg and foryeuynge / as that baillie dyd / and be nat to harde to their subgettes but merciable and for yeue hem their dettes which they owe to god & to them For god is so greate a lorde and so riche yt ther may no man do him fraude. of his gode ne hyndre ne lese hys lordshippe. The xii. chapter. DIues. In the fift precept thou seidest that riche mē. that wole nat help the pore folk ben mansleers Here thou seest yt they be theuys / and so it semyth that they do ayēst bothe precep∣tes. Pauper. In that the pore man may die for the riche mā wt holdith his gode from hym / in yt the riche man is a mansleer / and dothe ayenst this precepte Non occides. thou shalt nat slee And in that he witholdith his goode. from the pore man in his nede he is a theef and dothe ayenst this p̄¦cepte Non furtum facies Thou shalt do no thefte. For al that ye richeman hath passynge his ned∣ful lyuyng. after the state of his dispensacion / it is the pore man∣nes And therfore saith seint am∣brose. that it is no lesse synne. to the riche man for to denye the po¦re man helpe at nede whanne he may helpe him of his abūdaūce. thanne it is to robbe a mā of his goode. The brede saith he yt thou witholdest in superfluytee. is the pore folkes that haue hū∣gre And the waste clothynge yat thou shittest vp in superfluytie. is the pore wydowes. And the moneye that thou hydest in the
erthe in waste is the raunsome of the priseoners and of mischeuo{us} folke / for to deliuer them out of prisone and oute of bondes / and helpe them oute of woo. And therfore saithe he / wytte thou itt wel. that of asmany godes thou arte theif and rauenoure as thou mightest yeue to helpe of the po∣re folke if thou yeue them nat. Noo man shulde saye any thing his owne that is comyne to alle. Diues. I assent wele to thy wor¦des that riche men shulde yeue al¦messe of their haboundaunce sa∣uynge the state of their dispensa¦cion / & yt is fulle harde to do For moche thing is nedeful to the ri∣che man more thāne to the pore. bicause of his state. of dispensa∣cion. For moo thinges ben nede fulle to a kinge thāne to an erle. and moo to an Erle thanne to a simple knighte. and so it is of o∣ther staates. To kinges prin¦ces and lordes it is nedful to ha∣ue treasoure to wage men of ar∣mes in defence of the Realme / & to wage their officers in gouer∣naūce of the Realme and of ther lordship. And therfore an Em¦perour saide. Qui omnibus pre est: omnibus indiget. He that is Lorde by dispensacion of alle thinge in this worlde / hath nede of alle thinge. And so the more lorship in this worlde / the more nede. Pauper. Therfore of su¦che thinges so nedful to man af∣ter the state of his dispensacion. he is nat boūde to yeue the pore. but in greate nede. But of other superfluyte that is nat nedefulle to him in that degre / he is boūde to yeue For alway the comyn {pro}¦fytte owith to be chargyd more. thanne the profytte of one {per}sone Diues. It semyth by thy wor∣des that men of holy church whi∣che spende the godes of holy chir¦che in wicked vse / as in pompe. pride / glutony / lechery / and in o¦ther vanities be theues / for they witholde pore mēnys gode / and spende it mysuse ayēst the wylle of god and of pore folke Pau{per}. That is sothe / for seint Ierome saith that al that clerkes haue of holy churche godes / it is the pore mennys / and for helpe of the po∣re folke principaly holy churche is ēdowyd. To them that haue the benefices and ye godes of ho¦ly churche / it longith principaly to yeue almesse and to p̄aue cure of the pore people. Therfore seint Bernard / in epistola ad eu∣geniū / saith thus. the nakyd crie and the hungre pleyne them and say. ye bisshopes what doth gold in your bridles / it may nat putt away cold ne hūgre fro ye bridle
It is oure that ye so spende ī pō∣pe and vanytie. ye take it from vs cruelly / and spende it veyne∣ly. And in a nother pistle that he wrote to a chanon he saide thus. If thou serue wele goddes auter it is grauntyd to the to liue by ye auter / nat to bye their bridelles. silueryd or ouirgilt For what thou kepist for thy self of the au¦ter passinge thyn honest nedeful lyuynge / it is raueyne / it is theft it is sacrilege. Therfore these men of holy churche that boocle ther shone with boocles of siluer and vse greate siluer harneys in their girdylles and knyues / and men of religion / mōkes and cha¦nones / and suche other. that vse grete ouches of siluer and golde. on their copes to fastne their ho∣des ayenst the wynde / and ryde. on high horse with sadles harnei¦sed with gold and siluer more pō¦pouslye thanne lordes / be strōge theuys and do grete sacrilege so spēdyng the godes of holy chur∣che in vanite and pride / in luste of the flesshe / by whiche gode the pore folke shulde lyue. A lady of a thousande marke by yere cā¦pynne her hode ayenst the wynd with a smalle pynne of laton xii for a peny. But a monke that is bounden to pouertie by his pro∣fession wole haue an ouche / or a broche of golde and siluer in va∣lue of a noble or moche more. Diues Be nat such men of holy churche so mispendyng the pore mennys godes bounde to restitu¦tion. Pau{per}. If they haue wher¦of to make restitucion / they ben holden to restitucion / as saythe Dockynge super. Deutro. v.c. Quia non dimittitur peccatum donec restituatur ablatum. And therfore seint Austyne. In epistola ad Macedonium. saith thus. If a nother mannes gode be nat yoldē ayen whāne it may be yolden / he that stale it doth no verrey penaunce but he feyneth penaunce For if he do verrey pe∣naunce he must do restitucion to his power. Diues. And what saist thou of tho clerkes that spē¦de holy churche goodes. on their kynnesmen and wymen. and o∣yer rich folk for to be mayntened and for to haue a name and for to be worshiped in this worlde. Pauper If they yeue their kyn¦nesmyn and their frendes to rele¦ue theym of their nede / it is wele done. and the ordre of charite ax¦ith it. But if they yeue the godes of holy churche to make them ri∣che and grete in this world. of ye pore mennys gode / it is raueyne theft and sacrilege. Alsoo to yeue riche folke measurablye to
mayntene them rightfully in ho∣ly churche / it is wele doon Butt to yeue them holy churche godes to be worshipid and to haue a na¦me of pompe it is euyl doon and it is sacrilege & thefte so to spend the godes of holy chirch that ben the pore mennys godes. Diues. What sayste thou of theym that spende the godes of holy church. in their owne nedefulle vse / and doo nat their duite ne serue natt therfore. Pauper. The same Cclerke Dockynge in the same place faith / that they ben theues For the godes of holy churche / & the benefices ben youen to them. that they shulde trauayl and ser∣ue holy churche in techynge pre∣chynge and sacramentes yeuīge and in besy gouernaunce. And but they do so. they be natt wor∣thy to haue bn̄fices of holy chur∣che ne to lyue by holy church go∣des. And therfore Seint Poule. saith. Qui non laborat. nō mā∣ducet.· He that trauayleth natt shuld nat ete. And if yt they take holy churche godes / and traueyl nat therfore as they ben boundē they ben theuys. For if a labou∣rer toke money to trauayle in ye felde. and he trauayled nat ther∣fore / but he yaue it ayen he shuld be holden a theef. And therfore seint Poule saide. Qui episcopa¦tum desiderat / bonum opus de∣siderat. He yt desireth a busshop∣rike / he desireth a gode werke. Prima and Thimo. teercio For as saith the glose / in that that he desireth a busshoprike / he desirey a werke nat a dignitie. He desy∣reth trauayle / nat ease and reste. nat to wexe into pride / butt for to come from pride to more low¦nesse / to be seruaunt and minis∣ter of alle his subgettes of which he hath cure / or elles they be nat worthy to lyue by the goodes of holy churche For the benefices of holy churche be nat youen hē for to go pley theym / butt for to trauayle aboute their cure. Diues. They haue their vikers and their parisshe preestis vndre them. Pauper. The vyker and the parisshe preest shal aunswere for that they they resceiue and ye pesone for that / yt he resceyuethe. And he that more resceyueth mo∣re is boūde. And the benefices of holy church be nat youen to cler∣kes that they shulde betake to o∣ther men the cure / Butt for they shulde haue principal cure them self. For elles the lewyd man. & woman might haue the benefi∣ces of holy churche / as saithe the same Clerke. And he saith that persones whiche absent them fro their churches only for ese or for
couetise. or for luste of their fles∣she. and so spende the goodes of holy churche / they been theues Nathelesse as he saith they may absente them from ther churches for a tyme by leue of their soue∣raignes that may yeue theym le∣ue for sūme gode cause / as for ler¦nynge or for helpe of their chur∣ches. Also they that resceyue the benefices of holy churche and be vnable in that tyme whāne they resceyue them to serue holy chur∣che / or to haue cure of that bene¦fice / they ben theuys. But whan they falle in age and in feblenes after that they haue truly trauei¦led / or after that ye bn̄fice is yo∣uen them they may lefully lyue by their benefices but if they ha∣ue sufficient patrimony to be su¦steyned with. Also they that ap {pro}¦pre to them godes of holy church be theuys & do sacrilege as saith the same Clerke dockyng / in the same place For clerkes in theire begynnynge saie. Domin{us} pars hereditatis mee Oure lorde god is part of myne heritage For as saith seint Ierom. ad nepocianū He must be {per}te of god. and haue god to his part / and so haue him in his lyuynge / that he haue god with him and that god haue him And sithen he saith god is my {per}t. he owyth no thinge to haue butt oure lorde god.

For sūme prestes faitoures telle the people that but the messes be saide in thre daies principally of tho feestes / that is to saye in the festis and in two daies next fo∣lowynge / elles the soules be nat holpen by tho messes And so if the preest felle seke tho thre day∣es so that he might nat synge / al¦though he had sung alle thother messes / that trental mighte nat be done that yere by their oppini¦on. And soo in cas he shulde hap¦pen to be in syngyng of one tren∣tal x. yere / or twenty yere / there as he might euery yere synge his annuel.

They lye on seynt Grigory For his modre was a ful holy womā as we fynde in his lyf. And we fynde nat that seint gregory dyd any preeste synge in that maner. for any soule But we fynd libro iiii. dialogo{rum} That whan seint gregory knewe by reuelacion yt one of his monkes was in harde peyn of purgatorie for he hadde been a proprietarie vnto the ty∣me of his diynge / seint Gregory
badde one of his monkes which he leet a gode man syng for him thritty messes day by day And in the thritty daye the dede monke. apperyd to the same monke and thankyd him / for vnto this tym saide he I haue be in harde peyn but nowe I am deliueryd. And seynt Gregory tellith alsoo libro quarto dialogorum. that a soule apperyd to a preest and p̄y¦ed him that he wold haue mynde of him in his messe And he songe for him seuene daies by and by. and so the soule was deliuered For better it is to deliuer a soule oute of peyne within vii. daies. or xxx. thanne so to let him lan∣gore in peyne al ye yere whanne he might be holpen within thrit∣ty daies And so wolde euery mā. and woman that is in bodily dis¦ease and in prison.

And so it may be yt the feend fonde vp the gol¦den trental so to langore soules in their peyne / there they shulde the soner be deliuered. Pauper Therfore seint Gregory .iiio. et quarto dialogo{rum}. shewith by ma¦ny an example that it is beste to synge for the soules day by daye if the preeste be wele disposed to synge so. And he shewith there yt lettyng of any day syngynge. is grete disese to the soules / for thei desire ful moche to be deliueryd. oute of their peyne But the peo∣ple by faitre of couetous clerkes is so blent. that they haue leuyr. to yeue xx. shelinges to langore the soules in peyne al a yere / thā to yeue xx. shillinges or x. to ha¦ue them oute within a monethe. or moch lesse tym But leue frēde better it wer̄ to yeue xx shillīges to helpe them in haaste with the worship of god and of holy chur¦che. than for to yeue xx shillin∣ges late to helpe theym and that with offence of god. and p̄iudice of holy church And better it is to haue four score messes / sunge to gidre day by day for twenty shil∣linges thāne to haue thritty mes¦ses songe in the long yere for xx shillinges For why ye may for twēty shillinges do singe a quar¦ter of an annuel and do the sou∣les haue part nat only of thritty messes / but of asmany messes as be pens ī xx shilīgis For though ye yeue a thousande poūde for a
messe. the preest may nat appro∣pre that messe to any soule / butt only praye for him after yt he is bounden / & he must put his prai¦er in the wylle of god / and in his plesaunce / for in cas the soule yt he praieth fore is dampned And parauenture a pore mā. that no preest thinketh on in special / yat died in more charite than he that the preest praieth fore in special. shal rather be holpē by the messe of the preest thanne he for whom he prayeth in special. More ouir leue frende vnderstōde that praier is a grete gracious yift of god. For as say the clerkes holy praier is a stiyng vp of mannes herte and womannes to god. Oratio est ascensus mentis ī de¦um. And that may no man ha¦ue withouten special yift of god For Criste saith in the gospel / yt ther cūmeth no man to him / but ye fader of heuene drawe him by inwarde gostely mocion that is inwarde deuocion / And with∣outen this inwarde deuocion p̄y¦er of mouth is right noghtworth And therfore it is gode sumtyme to yeue almesse to a gode preeste whiche hath neede of almesse to meue him to pray for you yat ye may haue the grace of god & swe¦tenesse in him by the praier of the p̄ste and your almesse. Natheles ye shall nat yeue him almesse to cōstreyne him to certeyn prayer. after your deuise so to let him of his deuocōn. Ne ye shal nat ye∣ue him almesse with intēcion to let him to pray for whom that he wole after that his deuocion is & after ye god yeueth hī grace. For alway the prest must be more fre to pray thāne ye may be to yeue. ne ye may nat with your yift cō∣streyne him ne lett him to praye for whom that he wole praye. For al thoughe the preest be ar∣tyde by the lawe of his takynge ther may though noo lawe arte him of his praier but that he shal alway be fre to praye for whom that he wole / and as his deuoci∣on is for al cristen / and for the cō¦uersion of al hethen folke. And therfore leue frende ye shal yeue freely to the preest what you ly∣keth so to excite his deuocion to pray for you and the more to ha¦ue you in loue and mynde in his prayers / nat to lese his charite to pray for other. For the mo that he praieth fore by wey of charite the more profite it is to you and to your freendes soules. that he syngith fore. The xxiii. chapter.

The first maner of lesinges is done in v. maners. First if any man sey preche or teche any thing ayenst the feith of holy churche. The ii. is. whanne the lesyng harmethe sūme & {pro}fiteth to none / as lesyn¦ges of bacbiting & fals wytnesse of syn yt comyn lawe punyssheth The thridde is yt so {pro}fitith to one yt it harmeth to a nother / as false wytnesse in cause of dett or of he¦ritage or of suche other. The iiii. is whanne the lesynge is maade withoutē {pro}fyte / and withouten cause. saue only for likyng to lie and to disceyue / and for custome of lesinges. The fift is whan the lesynge is made only for to plese as flateringe Alle these maner of lesynges ben forboden by this cō∣maundment to alle maner folk. as dedly synne The lesynge of flatering may be done in thre ma¦ner / or prisynge a man in thyng. that he hath more than he is wor¦thy to be prised / or prisyng him ī thing that he hath nat / or prisīg him and flateryng him ī his syn. and shrewydnesse and in his foly And this maner of flatering if it be done wyttyngly / it is dedely synne The secoūde maner of lesyng that is clepyd Officiosū and proufitable / it is done in iii. maners. First for saluacion. of catel that shulde elles be loste wyckedly by theues if they wiste where it were Also for saluacion of man or of woman innocent. that is sought of his ennemyes.

But it fallith to them principal∣ly to fle ydel wordes For Criste saith in the gospel / that mē shall yeue aunswere at the dome for e∣uery ydel worde that they saye. But suche lesynges bourdful in men of {per}feccion turne lightly to lesynges {per}nicious and wycked.

The iiii. chapter. DIues Seint Austyn saith that lesynge and liynge is nat only in feyned speche but al∣so in feyned dedes. Pauper Seynt austyn saith nat that all feyned dedes ben lesynges & syn. but he saith that al feyned speche in falshede is lesyng and synne. For mā hath more fre mighte to gouerne his speche thanne for to gouerne his dedys / for alwaye a man may speke as he wole / butt he may nat alway do as he wole And the philosophre saith. po {per}y armynias / yt speche is token of thoughtes in the hert For it is or¦deyned yt mā by his speche shuld shewe thing to be or nat to be / as he felith and thynketh in his hert And therfore Crist said in the go¦spel. Sit sermo vester est ē / non nō. Be your speche yhe yhe. nay. nay / That as it is in the hert soo it be in the mouthe. yt yhe of the mouthe be yhe of the herte. And nay of the mouthe be nay of the hert / so yt the mouthe & the hert must alway accorde. For as saith seint austyn In libro cōtra mendacium. The mouth berith wytnesse to the hert And therfor̄ if man or woman say otherwise thanne it is / in his hert / he berith fals wytnesse ayēst his hert & a∣yenst him self. & doth ayēst the p̄∣cept of god / yt biddeth him say no fals witnesse ayēst his nighbour ne ayēst his nexte / yt is his owne hert and his soule Another skyll is this for dede is nat ordeyned. principally to be wytnesse to the thought of mānes herte / but it is ordeined to the profit of the doer and to the proufytte of his ney∣ghboure & to the worship of god. And therfore. Whanne feynyng in dede is profitable to the doer. and to his euyn cristen and to ye worship of god / it is leful and in case fulle medeful. And therfore dauid whan he was amōges his enemyes in perel of of dethe / me¦defully feyned him to be woode. so to saue his lyf to the worship

Thou shalte nat coueite thy nighboures gode with wronge / house ne londe In the viii. preceptes bifore god for¦bedith all wycked werkes. In these ii. last he forbedith al wyc∣ked wylles and consent to synne For of wycked wyl cūmeth yuel dede And therfore Criste saith in the gospel / that oute of the herte. cometh al maner synne. for with outen wylle and assēt of the hert is no synne done. De corde exi¦unt cogitaciones male / homici∣dia adulteria fornicationes / fur¦ta falsa testimonia / blasphemie. Mt. xv. Therfore seint Poule. saith that couetise is rote of alle euyl.

This precept is principaly a¦yēs false purchasoures / that for false couetise ben besy to begyle. and with falshed to robbe men of house / and of londe & put theym oute of their heritage. To suche false purchasoures god yeuethe his curse and saith thus. Ve qui cogitatis īutile et operamini ma¦lum in cubilibus vestris. &c.

By the asse I vnderstonde welth of this world that stondith principaly in riches¦ses and in bodily helthe / whiche berith a man vp in this world as the asse bare balaam.

and take hede what the aungell sayde to Balaam. Butt the asse sayde he. hadde gone oute of the waye I hadde slayne the For but welthe of the worlde wente sumtyme oute of the waye by ad¦uersite and by sekenesse / elles it shulde be cause to moche folke. of dethe. bothe bodily and gostly For if man hadde alway his welthe and his wyl in this world he shulde yeue no tale of god / ne of man. ¶The secounde too∣ken was that he hurte his foote. and soo diseased his bodye / thatt is whanne god sendith man seke¦nesse and castith him downe ī his bedde / and maketh him so feble. that his feete may nat bere hym. thāne take thou hede to thy wey and to thy lyf. if it be ought con¦trarie to god / and if it be amend the. The thridde token was. that the asse fel downe vndre his feet in a streyt wey / and wold no ferther bere him This streyt wey & so narow a paas / is deth where no man may flee Thanne welth of this worlde lykned to the asse. fallith downe to grounde & wole no lēger here mā vp in this world Thanne passith helth and welth and al lust of the flesshe And ther¦fore whanne thou cūmyst to the poynt / take hede to thy wey and to thy lif.

The viii. chapter. PAu{per}. Two thinges prin∣cipaly shulde abate coue∣tise of mannys herte. Vnstable∣nesse of this worlde and drede of dethe. First vnstablenesse of this worlde / for this worlde. and the welth of this world is lykned to foure thinges ful vnstable To a whele aboute turnyng / to a shyp in the se sailyng / to a floure that sone fadith and fallith to groūd. and to a shadow that alway pas¦sith and duellith but a stounde Firste welth of this world is lyk¦ned to a whele aboute turnynge. for whan the whele gothe about that / yt is byneth. anone it is abo¦ue. and that yt is aboue. anone it is byneth. And that yt is on thone syde anone it is on the other syde Right so it is in the whele of for∣tune of this worlde. For nowe a man is byneth in his youthe & in his begynnynge In myddel age he is aboue in his welthe & in his floures / But anon the whele tur¦neth downe ayen to greter age to pouert / to seknesse and feblenes. tyl at the last he fallith of ye whe¦le / & dieth / & lyeth there as a clott of erthe by the walle. Tferfore in the whele of fortune is writē this verse. Regnabo regno. regnaui. sū sine regno. Man in his youth
whanne he is towarde in hope of welthe. he saith Regnabo. I shal reigne. But whanne he is in his myddyl age and hath the world at wyll and so sytteth aboue on the whele. than he saith ī his pri∣de. Regno. Nowe I regne. I am alle aboue But anone the whele turneth doūwarde anon cūmeth age sekenesse / feblenesse / losse of catel and aduersite  than he may say Regnaui. I haue regned. sū∣tyme I was a man But whanne he lyeth on diynge he may saye Sum sine regno. I am without kingdome. My reigne my king¦dome. my welth is done. Also in the whele of fortune / that is ī the one syde / anone it is in the other syde For they that ben this daye a mannes frendes and stonde on his side to help him / the next day they shalbe his enemyes and stō∣de ayēst him with his aduersarie Of this whele speketh Dauid. In circuitu impii ambulāt. Wic¦ked couetouse folke goo aboute as a whele. Posuisti eos vt rotā. et sicut stipulam ante faciē vēti. Lorde saith he thou hast put thē as a whele / and a stoble bifor̄ the face of the wynde For as the sto∣ble while the wynde bloweth wa¦uereth and fleeth aboue in theyr. nowe high. nowe lowe / but anon as the wynde passith it fallith a downe to the erth and lyeth there stylle. Right so the proude coue¦tous folke wauere in this world in welthe and worship / nowe hi∣gher / ne lower / And as the stoble and the strawe in his flighte ke∣pith noo certeyn waye / soo kepe they no wey of goddes lawe / tyll at the last the wynd passith oute. of their body and they fal downe into ther graue / and many of thē into the pytte of helle. Also this worlde is lykned to a shyp. in the see saylyng For be the ship euir so grete of him self and haue the wynde with him al at wylle. and bere he his saile neuir so high & go he neuir so yerne / be he pas∣sed there is no tokē where he wēt Right so be a man neuir so grete in this worlde / and haue the wīd of mennys mouthe neuir so wele wt him to bere his name. to pryse him and to flatere him / thoughe his name sprynge neuir so wyde and bere him neuir so high in pri∣de / or be he so solēpne & so migh∣ty. yt no man dare quycche ayenst him ne do / be he dede. and passed oute of this world / sone he is for yetten. Men shal fynde no tokē of him within a fewe yeres / Vn∣nethes shal he fynde one frende. that wole do syng a messe for his soule. Go to the churchyerd and thou shalt knowe by the bodies.
the riche from the pore / the faire. from the foule / the wise from the foles / the free fro the bonde. But at they turne there to erth & asshē to wormes mete / to stynche and vnclēnesse Al these grete kinges that were sūtym so grete of name where ben they al bicome. Alex∣ander. Iulius cesar Nabugodo¦nosor. Octouyan. Arthur̄. king charles & al suche other / where be they bicome. Therfore they may say that is writen in the book of wysdome Quid nobis {pro}fuit su{per}¦bia &c. What profited to vs oure grete pride. What halpe vs oure pōpe & oure grete richesses. All is passed away as a shadowe / & as a ship yt passith the wawes of the see / of which be it passed mē may fynde no token Sap̄. v. c. Man¦nes lyf may wele be lykened to a ship whiche is streyt & narowe at bothe endes / but in the myddes it is wyde & large. Right so is mā∣nes lyf / for his byrth & his begyn¦nyng is ful strayt & ful narowe. For he cūmeth into this worlde naked and pore / wepynge & wa∣lyng / vnmighty. vnwytty / & no∣ght may ne can helpe hym self / & with moche trauayle is brought forth / til by litel & litel he cūmeth to mānes age. There the ship of his lyf is sūdele wyde & large / for in his myddel age he hath moost his miyht / his wytte & his wylle. But anone the ship of this lif dra¦weth to another strayte ende. A∣none cūmyth age / feblenesse sek∣nes. aduersite / losse of catel / & po¦uert / & at the last dethe maketh a ful strayte ende / whāne he dyeth with bytter peyne ī moche drede. & moche sorowe & wendith hens nakyd & pore / right as he came / & nought berith wt him but his de∣des gode & wycked. Of these ii. streyte endes saith Iob thus. Nudus egressus sum de vtero matris mee: et nudus reuertar il∣luc. Nakyd I came oute of my moders wombe / & nakyd I shal turne ayen into the erth moder of all. And if a man wole stire wele a shyp or a bote / he may nat stōd in the myddes of the ship / ne ī the former ende. but he muste stōde ī the laste ende / & there he may stir̄ the ship as he wole. Right so he yt wole styre wele the ship of his lyf in this worlde / he may nat stōde in the myddes of his ship / nat set bis thoughte & his hert in welthe yt he hath in his middel age / ne he shal nat stonde in the former ēde nat sett his hert ne his thoughte. in his byrthe ne in his begynnīge to thynke moche of his kynrede. ne of alliaunce to stire him to pri¦de. Butt he must stōde in the last ende of his shyppe. and of his lyf
and thinke on his dethe / and on laste his ende. And howe mys∣cheuously / and howe perilously. he shal wend hens / and how whe¦dyr ne whanne / wote he neuir. And in that maner he shalle best stere the shyppe of his lyf to the si¦ker hauene of heuyn blisse Ther¦fore the wyseman saith Memo∣rare nouissima tua et in eternum non peccabis. Thynke in ward∣ly of thy laste thinges & of thyne ende. and thou shalt neuir do syn Ecclesiastes vii. In the begyn∣nyng of euery dede / thynk on the ende what ende it may haue and what may falle therof. The ix. chapter. ALso welth of this world is lykned to a floure that so∣ne fadeth and fallith to ye groūd For as the rose floure is faire to the sight / swete in smellyng / soft in handlynge / soo welthe of this worlde is faire to the sight of mā and likynge in the hauyng But right as the rose wexith alway a¦monges the thornes / and he that gadrith roses but he be more wa∣re shal lightly hurte him & pryck him. Right so welth and riches∣ses of this world wexith al amō¦ges thornes of harde trauayle of thought of besynesse and of ma∣ny perels. bothe bodily and gost∣ly For a man hath moche traueil in the gettyng / moche drede ī the kepyng / moche bytter sorowe in the lesyng. Diues diuicias nō congregat abs{que} labore. Non te∣net abs{que} metu. nec deserit abs{que} dolore. Whanne a mā hath tra∣uayled all his lyf tyme to gadre gode / and to haue welth and wor¦ship in this worlde / it wole sone welke fade and fall away as the rose. Sodeynly cūmeth moreyn and his beestes dye / cūmeth ad∣uersite and losse of catel. and att last deth takith away euery deel And who soo wole be besy to ga∣dre the rose of worldly welth and of richesses / but he be right ware he shal hurte him bothe bodily. & gostly And therfore seint Poule saith that they that coueyte to be riche in this worlde / they falle in the feendes snare & into ful hard temptacions For these skylles seint Iames saith yt the riche mā shal passe away as the floure of the grasse & of the hay For whan the sonne shyneth hote on the hey it welkith and drieth & his floure fadith. and his beaute passithe Right so saith he the rich mā wel¦kith and fadith in his weyis that is to say in his lyuyng Iacobi. i.
Also worldly welth is lykned to the shadowe alway passing For al oure lyuyng in this worlde is but a passynge and a wantynge of light of heuene blisse In the middes of the day whan the sōne is highest / thanne is the shadowe shortest Right so whan a mā we∣nyth to be butt in the myddes of his lyf. and is highest in welthe. & in his pride / thanne is his lif shor¦test / for thanne men dye sonest ī their moste prosperite And the ni∣gher euen and the end of the day. the lenger is a mannys shadowe. Right so these worldly couetous men the lēger that they lyue and whanne they been att their lyues ende / thanne they thynke moste to lyue lenger Thanne they pur¦chace / than they house / than they begyn to plete tyl their lyf passe. sodenly away as the shadowe at euē Therfore mannes lyf is lyk¦ned to a slyder wey For whanne a man gothe by a slyder wey / the more that he gasith aboute / and the ferther that he loketh fro him the soner and the harder he shalle fal But if he loke wel to his feet. and to his way / he may kepe him on lofte / & though he fal. he shall take no grete harme. Right so it farithe by the lyf of this worlde. It is so slyder. that there mighte neuir mā ne womā passe by this wey / but at the laste he slydethe into sekenesse and myscheif / nd fel downe and dyed. or elles shal come to the same end And comō / ly whanne men loke ferthest fro them self and thynke to lyue len¦gest / & begynne mooste to house. & to purchace / and purpose ma∣ny shrewyd turnes / and to lyue moste in welth & in delices thāne they dye sonest and passe awaye. sodenly / as a shadowe at euen. Example Crist tellith in the go¦spel Luce. xii. Ther was saithe Criste sumtyme a riche man and hadde in a yere a plenteous crop. on his londe. in somoche that he hadde nat houses ynowe to ley it in He thākyd nat god of his yift butt turnyd him to proude coue∣tous thoughtis / and saide to him self / what shal I doo I haue no housyng to ley in my corne & my gode I shal distroy myn olde ber¦nys and garneris and mak newe lenger and larger. and stuffe thē ful of gode. and thanne shalle I say to my soule. Nowe soule thou haste goode enough for ma¦ny yeres / nowe take thy reste. Now ete and drynke and make feest So he thought al of his lyf in this worlde and nought of the lyf in the other worlde. Anone god saide to him. Fole this night fendes shall take thy soule from

The x. chapter CLerkes that trete of kynd say that the fox in wynter whanne he goth to seke his pray if he cūme to a frosen water / he ly¦eth his ere downe to the yce / & if he here any water rynnynge vn∣drenethe / he wole nat passe ouyr ther̄ / for the yce is nat syker But he sekith him a nother siker way. Thus I wolde yt al synful coue¦touse men dyd / whan they goo a¦bout to seke their pray of false co¦uetyse / of fals purchas / or to rob & begyle any man of his gode. Thanne I wolde they leyd their erys to the yce and thought how freyle a mannes lyf is For as the yce cūmeth of the water and tur∣neth ayen to the water / righte so al we came of the erthe. & shalle turne ayen. to the erthe / & if they wolde thus ley their ere to this y∣ce / they shuld here water rēnyng They shuld here say / there dyeth a pope / there a kinge / there a prī¦ce. there a duyke. there dyethe a busshoppe. there a knighte. there a squyer. They shulde here that assone dieth the riche / as the pore / the grete as the smalle / the yonge as the olde. Therfore ho∣ly wrytte saith.

And sithen they shalbe dampned that wolde nat yeue to his enemyes at nede. for his sake / moch soner shal they be dāpned yt wold nat helpe his freē¦des and his true seruaūtes at ne∣de for his sake. yt putt thē self for his loue to pouert and moch tra∣uayle for helpe of mannes soule And if it be so plesaunt and med∣full to yeue almesse to suche pore folke forsakinge the worlde / of whiche many neither shalbe res∣ceyued into endlesse tabernacles of blisse / neither shall resceyue in to that blisse. moch more it is ple¦saūt to god and meritorie to help them that ben pore in spirite. and in wyll for the loue of god. For as Crist saith in the gospell. the kīgdome of heuenes is theirs and it is grauntyd to them to res∣ceyue folk that haue holpen thē into endlesse tabernacles. The xv. chapter And therfore leue freēd wyt¦ye it wele yt if mā or womā haue more wyll to yeue to them that been pore ayenst their wylle and for the loue of synne / thanne for to yeue to them that ben pore for goddes sake. and for goddes cause. they synne ful greuously. and lese the mede of their almesse in that they putt goddes enemy∣es bifore his frendes / and vice bi∣fore vertue.

{pro}ximi tui / nō seruū / nō ancillā. nō bouē / nō asinū / nec omīa que illius sunt. Exodi. xx. Thou shalt nat desire thy neighboures wyf / nat his seruaūt nat his may¦den. nat his oxe / nat his asse / ne no thinge that to him longith. In the nynthe cōmaundemente. god forbidith couetise of a nother mannes gode nat mouable. In this laste he forbedith all maner false couetise of a nother mānes gode meuable Also in the nynthe p̄cept he forbedith couetise of the iye / in this last principaly he for / bedith couetise of the flessh. And therfore saith seynt austyne that the tenthe p̄cepte is this alloone. thou shalt nat desir̄ thy nighbou¦re wif. And all yt folowith after whāne he saith nat his seruaūte. nat his oxe ne his asse / ne no thīg yt to him lōgith / it is of the nynth p̄cepte. And it is also a newe for∣bedynge of all maner mys coue∣tise. bothe of thing meuable and nat meuable bothe of couetise of the iye & of the flessh. And therfor̄ if a man myscoueyt a nother mā¦nes seruaunt / or his wyf / or his childe / as for possession. and ser∣uyce / it is ayenst the nynthe pre∣cepte / and principally ayenst co∣uetise of the iye And if he coueyte theym for mysluste of the flesshe. thanne it is ayenst the tenthe cō∣maundement. Diues. I hope yt nat euery miscouetise is dedely synne ayenst goddes precept For couetise both of the iye and of the flesshe fallith lightly in mannes hert And it is nat in our power al¦waye to flee thoughtes of fals co¦uetise For as seynt poule saithe. the flesshe couetith alway ayenst the spirite Pauper.

Diues Sith it is so that false co¦uetise with assent and wyll to {per}∣fourme / it is dedly synne / and a∣yenst goddes p̄cepte / & as seynte poule saith / It is roote & begyn∣nyng of euery euyl.

And for as¦moche as the vnwise peple hath more knowynge yt mysdede was synne thanne myswylle / and felt them more agreuyd by mysdede. than myswylle / therfore god for∣bedith first the dede of false coue¦tyse / & after he forbedith the wyll and the assent to myscouetyse.

God in the sixte bi¦heest forbidith the dede of lichery and of spousebreche. and in this heest he forbedith the wylle. and the cōsent of hert to lecherie. and

He that seeth a womā & coueytithe her by desire to doo lechery with her / he hath do lechery ī his hert / though he do it nat in dede. And therfore eche man shulde take hede visily what thouthtes entre īto his hert & if any thoughtes ben about to drawe the reson of his soule to cō¦sent to synne / anone put he awey tho thoughtes mightilye / & let hī think on the bytter peynes. yt crist suffryd in his syde / hondes & feet & o turne his myslust into deuo∣cion of cristes passion / & quenche the brennyng thoughtes of liche¦ry with the blode and the water yt rāne out af cristes side / whan his hert was clouen a two wt yt sharp spere / & thynk on ye endles loue yt cryst shewyd than to him & to all mankynde And so to turne his foule stinkinge loue yt he begyn∣neth to falle in shame & shenship. īto the swete clene loue of ihū ful of ioye & worship Tellith the ma¦ster of kynd .li.xii. yt ther is a bird in egipt yt is clepyd a pellicane.

Wherfore this pellicane Iesus crist seynge the myscheif yt mākynde was fal in be gyle of the feēd / he had ruth on mankynde. And for grete lo∣ue yt he had to mākynde / as seint Poule saith. he auentisshed hym¦self & toke flessh and blode of the mayden marye / & bicame man in the lyknesse of a seruaunt / and in oure māhede. & in oure kynde suf¦fred to be taken and be bounde & beten / forspited / dispysed / discour¦gyd at the pyler. be crowned with thornes / be naled to the tree hon∣des & feet / & hangyd on the crosse as a theef amonges theuys / & be¦stōge to the herte with the sharpe spere. & so dyed bytter deth / al for oure gilt & nat for his gilt. for he dyd neuir amysse in worde. ne in dede. as saith seint petyr in his pi¦stel And thus for oure loue yt ben to bī ful vnkynde / he shed his p̄∣cio{us} blode out of euery {per}te of his blisful body borne of the maydē.

For if we do somoche righte and fauoure to one yt it be hyndrynge to anothers right / thā the rynges in our habergeon of rightfulnes. accorde nat ne be wele knytte to¦gider But ther is an hole wherby the feende may hurt oure soule Also he byddeth vs arme our feet & our legges with legge harneys yt is gostly pouert yt we withdra∣we oure hertes & oure affections. from erthly thinges / & nat set our loue to moche in erthely thinges ne in worldly godes / nat to stry∣ue / nat to plete for no worldly go¦des / but the more nede cōpell vs therto / but seke to lyue ī pees wt all men if it may be. And thus
arme vs with gostly pouert oure legges and our feet / that is to say oure loue and oure affections a∣yenst the temptacions of false co¦uetise. And therfore he byddeth vs shoe oure feet into the dightīg of the gospel of peas. For euery cristen man and woman owethe to haue gostly pouert which crist taughte in the gospel / and to for¦ther the gospel of crist that is the gospel of pees ī wyl & dede to his power / & to tech it if he cā. And if he can nat. helpe and forther thē that can in teching of the gospel. and of goddes lawe / & helpe thē with his gode to their nedeful su¦stenaūce if he may & and they ha∣ue nede. Also he biddeth vs take to vs the shelde of feith / for as ye sheld is a triangle & hath thre cor¦ners / in whiche triangle if fro the myddes be drawen thre lynes. in to the thre corners / ther shulde be thre triangles / whiche thre be but one triangle / and yit none of thē is other And therfore he saith. feith of the holy trinyte is likned to a shelde / for ther been thre {per}so∣nes in the holy trinyte / the fader. the sonne. and the holy gooste / & eche of them is god. and none of theym is other. And though they ben alle thre but one god in maiestie / this sheld of fei∣the of the holy Trinyte. vs must take to vs in gostly fight & bile∣ue in the hooly trinyte & sett alle oure feith & alle oure trust in one god in trinyte / and pray to the fa¦dre almighty / that he sēde vs mi∣ght. to the sonne al witty that he graunte vs wytt and wysdome. to the boly gooste all gracious & ful of mercy / that he graunte vs grace / so that we may haue miʒt wytt and grace to withstonde al gostly enemyes. Also he byddeth vs to take to vs. the basynett of helth. and of saluacion / as saith the glose / hope to haue the mais∣tre of oure enemyes by the helpe of god / and heuene blisse to oure mede for oure fightynge and for oure trauayle For ther wyl noo man put him to lauful fight / but in hope to haue the maistrie / and mede for his trauayle And as the basynet wel arayed is clene fur∣busshed from rust / and made sly∣ke and smothe. that shot may so∣ne glide of / and it is highest of al armure goyng and gaderyng vp¦warde into a smalle poynte / soo muste oure hope and oure truste. principaly go vp to god / and nat set oure hope ne oure trust to mo¦che in mannes might ne in erthly helpe / whiche is but ruste wastīg the basynet of hope that we owe to god. Therfore saith the {pro}phet Ieremye. Cursed be the mā that
trustith in man / and in flesshelye might / & lettith his hert go all ey fro god And blissed be that man. Which settith his hope & his trust in oure lorde god Ieremye xvii. Also seint poule biddeth that we shulde take with vs rerebras and vābras and gloues of plate that is to say gode occupaciones & be¦synesse in gode werkes And ther∣fore he biddeth vs wake in al ma¦ner besynesse of gode werkis For as the wise mā saith Ec. xxxiii. Idelship & sluth is cause of moch wyckednesse For an ydel man & lustles is lyke a man hondlesse / & wepenles amonge his enemyes. and lyke a man in batteyl withe naked armes and hondes / which for nakednesse and for defaut of armure lesith both arme & honde Also we must do aboue the acke or the acton of charite For as the iacke is softe and nesshe & by his softnesse and nesshenesse softithe & feynteth al strokes yat cūmeth therayenst / so charite softith and feyntith all the dyntes of the feē¦des temptacion. Therfore seint poule saith / that charite suf¦freth al thinge paciently / & ma∣keth euery trauayle soft & berith al thinge easily. Omnia suffert. oīa sustinet. Prima ad co{rum}. xiiii And therfore seyth the glose there that charite & pacience & benigny¦te. Withe compassion of otheres myscheif / been the principall ar∣mure that lōgith to cristen peple This iacke of charite is betoke∣nyd by the clothe of crist withou∣tē seme all wōne aboue into one whiche in tyme of his passion the knightes wold nat ky / but kept it hole / and kest lott who shulde haue it hole In token that euery gode knight of god shuld be besy to arme him with the clothe & the iacke & the armure of charite / and trauayle to saue peas & vnyte. & make no diuision For the end of euery batayle shulde be pees / & to ye ende & for none other mē of ar∣mes shuld traueil & fight / as saith seint austyn. Thus leue frēde I pray you yt ye arme you in gostly armure. as goddes gode knight. For though ye be nat able to bo∣dily batayl / ye be yit able to gost¦ly fight In that yt ye be cristen ye be cristes knight ordeyned to fiʒt in this gostly bateyl / if ye wol be saued. And therfore arme ye you wel as I haue nowe sayed & gird ye you with the swerde of goddis worde / by which ye shuld defēde you from al gostly enemyes For as the swerde {per}sith / kyttith & ma¦keth se{per}acion / so goddes worde. & prechinge techinge & redyng of goddes worde & of goddes lawe. {per}sith mānes hert / & womans and

Therfore crist seith that he came nat to ma¦ke sinful peas / but to sēde swerd of se{per}atione in erthe / to distroye wycked peas yt men haue in their synne Therfore leue frende as goddes gode knight gyde ye you with this swerde of goddes word yt is to say fastne ye it wel in your hert by heryng & reding / by techīg & by dede doynge / & than take ye to you the spere of cristes passion & thynke howe he was smyten to the hert for your sake wt ye sharpe spere. & his syde opned. & his hert clouen a two to shewe you howe moche he louyd you And thanne he shedde oute his hert blode and water in token. yt if he hadde had more blode more he wolde haue shed. for your loue Moreouir ye shal vnderstōde yt in bodily fight a mā must chese him a gode groū¦de & a playn place to sight in For it is no gode fightyng in myres. ne amonge corne / in slidre wey. & pitty groūde / ne in stoble groūd And therfore seint poule biddeth vs stonde in treuthe & equite yt in all oure doynge we loke to oure grounde & oure cause be true and rightful / clere & clene. & make no stryf in vncerteyne Also a wyse knight in his fight wole take wt him the hyl & the sūne & the wīde if he may. & so must vs in gostly fight take with vs the hyl of ho∣ly lyuyng yt we may say with the apostle. Nr̄a cōuersatō in celis ē Oure liuyng & cōuesacione is in heuenes & in heuynly thinges. And therfore seint poule biddeth vs stōde {per}fite in alle thinges. Al∣so we must take with vs in oure fight the sūne & the lighte of god∣des grace / & the wynde of holy p̄y¦er. And therfore seint poule bid∣deeth vs praye in euery tyme & al¦way / by al maner prayer & bise∣chyng in the holy gost / yt is to sey with the grace of the holy gooste In this maner leue frende. arme ye you in gostly armure / & dispo∣se ye you to gostly batteyl ayēste al gostly enemyes / & gouerne ye wele your hors of your boody as I haf seyd Lete it nat be to feble by oudone abstinēce & traueil / ne to wild by ouirdon rest / by gluto∣nye / by lechery / by wycked desy∣res of the flesshe & euyl wylles for in caas such wycked wylles & de¦sires been dedly synne in goddes sight & ayēst this last p̄cept Ther¦fore dauid saith yt god p̄ueth and knowith mānes hert & his leēdes yt is to say god knowith mannes wyll & his lust For he knowith
more verely the thoughtes of mē¦nes hertis & wymēs / thanne any man may. knowithe others wer∣kes He seeth & knowith alle thīg And therfore such as man or wo∣man is in hert & in soule / & in wyl suche he is bifore god yt knowyth bothe body and soule.

Diues. Why were tho vi kynredes of Iacob so assigned of god to curse the brekers of god∣des lawe / & the other vi. assigned to blesse the ke{per}s of goddes lawe Pau{per}. Them yt were most vn∣gentyl of birthe god assignyde to curse For al tho vi. sones of Ia∣cob. Were borne of the secūdarye
wyues that were but seruauntes to his cheif wyues / lya. & rachel. saaf. ruben. Whiche lost his wor∣shippe / for that he laye by his fa∣ders secundarie wyf. that highte bala. The other vi. kynredes we¦re borne gentyl of birthe / for thei were borne of the principal & mo¦re gentyl wyues / Lya & Rachel. foure of lya / & ii. of rachel. And therfore god ordeyned theym to blesse / in token yt no mā shuld be chosen to preesthode. but he were gentyl by wantyng of cursed cō∣dicions. And also in tokē that it is more kyndely to worshipful {per}¦sones as al prestes shulde be / to blesse than to curse. And therfore busshopes & other p̄stes shuld nat curse but for a full greuouse opē syn & for grete nede. Therfore poule saith. to mē of {per}feccion as al p̄stes shulde be. Benedicite. et nolite maledicere. Blesse ye and be ye nat in wylle ne redy to curs but for grete nede / and that it be done in charite to worship For cursyng in the self is a dede of im¦{per}feccion. And therfore god chose theim that were mooste im{per}fyte. and leest worshipful of the birth to {pro}nounce the curse / & the moste {per}fite & worshipful in birthe to {pro}∣nounce his blessing to ye kepers of his lawe.

Butt leue freende byleue ye it forsothe yt ther is an hundryd thousāde thousād folde more blisse than any tunge may telle. or any hert thynke.

It farith by folke borne in prisone. of the wycked worlde as it dothe by a childe borne in the depe derk pytt of the prison whan it fallith a woman with childe be put ī pri¦sone.

But aslonge as he hath his moder wt him & his sustenaunce though it be fulfeble / he maketh no sorow ne care. He lōgith after no better fare. for he knowith no better. For if his moder telle him of the ioye and welfare oute of prisone of the sūne / mone & of the sterres. of the faire floures spryngynge. vpon erth. of the briddes syngīg
of myrthe / of melodye / of rich ar¦raye / of lordes of ladies / & welth yt is oute of prison. alle hir tale is but a dreme to the childe. he bile∣uyth it nat / and therfore he lon∣gith nat therafter. and wole natt for al this blisse / & the welefare yt she spekith of / forsake his modre ne the feble fare. that he hath wt her / and that is for he bileueth it nat And yit it is as the modre tel¦lith the childe But were the child onys out of prison. and sawe the welthe & myrthe and the welfare whiche his moder told him of. he wold be ful sory for to wēde ayē to prison there to lyue wt his mo¦der For al his lyf in prison yt was firste likinge ynough to hī shuld than be full bytter. and he shulde neuir haue ioye ne rest in hert tyl he came ayen to that welefare. yt he saw out of prison. Right thus folke of this world borne & brou∣gt forth in sorowe and care and moche trauayle in the prisone of this worlde / they haue so moche loue and likynge to theire erthly moder and to ther cūpany / yt is to say in erth & in erthely thīges / for erth is moder of alle. yt they haue no likyng in heuenly thinges / ne longe nat therafter And yit their gostly moder holy churche & ther gostly fader & god hīself fader of al tellith them of the blisse of he∣uen It is to thē butt a dreme / as is the moders tale to her childe in prisō / and they haue no sad feith therin And though it be so as our moder holy church tellith vs tho∣ugh the childe bileue nat yt suche welfare be out of prisone / the wel¦fare is neuir the lesse. & though er∣thly couetouse mē haue no likīg but in erth & in erthly thinges bi∣leue nat yt suche blisse be in heuen yit ther is suche blisse. & neuir the lesse for their fals bileue But had they onys sene and assayed a ly∣tel of that blisse / all the ioye and likyng yt they haue in this world & in erthly thinges shuld be to thē ful grete bytternes ful of sorow. & care. Example we haue of seīt petyr. Whom Criste ledde vpon the hylle of Thabor. With seynt Iohn & Iames. & there he shewid them but a litel of the blisse of his manhode. His face shone as bri∣ght as the sūne / his clothes were white as snowe. Moyses & Hely aperyd wt hī ī grete blisse & maies¦tie.
