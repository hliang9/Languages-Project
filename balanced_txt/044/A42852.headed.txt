To which is annexed The nature of a Writ of ERROR, and the general proceedings thereupon. WITH A plain TABLE for the easie finding out of every particular. By William Glisson and Anthony Gulston, Esquires, Baristers at Law. The Second Edition; revised, explained, and much en∣larged by W. S. of the Inner-Temple, Esquire. Good communicated doubles it self. —Vivere nemo Nunc sine Lite solet, nec sine Lege potest. LONDON, Printed by the Assigns of Rich. and Edw. Atkins, Esq for Hen. Brome and Tho. Basset, and are to be sold at the Gun in St. Pauls Church-yard, and at the George in Fleetstreet, MDCLXXIX.
The Epistle Dedicatory. TO THE Professors & Practisers OF THE COMMON LAW OF ENGLAND. Candid Reader. THis Tract in French was be∣queathed to me by an alliance, Wil∣liam Glisson Esquire deceased, which I have translated into our own Language for the Common benefit of all. I am not singular in it, for daily experience manifests the contrary: neither is it a Novelty for Law-books to appear in this dress. Antiquity may be pleaded, Sr.
Germin Perkins, Stanford, Cromp∣ton, Lambert, Sir Henry Finch, Dalton, and divers others have in for∣mer days troden this path. My desires are that it may not be perused by those who read only to fault, what they cannot mend, but by those whose judicious Pen will correct the errors as Cognizances of humane frailty. I wish it successful to all, be he Pleader or Practiser; and that the Common Law of England may shine forth in these Cloudy, and Eclip∣sed days, is the Prayer of him who is Stple Iune, January 20th, 1658. A Well-wisher to the Laws HEN. APPLEGARTH.
To the READER. Ingenuous Reader, THese ensuing Lines were not fixed to this Treatise to commend its worth unto thee; for, if I can judge rightly, it needs them not, as I doubt not but thou wilt con∣fess upon the perusal of it. And this made me some years past take some pains in correcting many Errataes of the Press, and explaining many obscurities I met with; and in shew∣ing the reason of the Law in many places, without any other aim than my own private satisfaction. But since that understanding an intent of Re-printing of the Copy, I thought it not amiss to impart what I had done to the Undertakers thereof; not only for their benefit, but for the Readers clea∣rer information, and easier understanding of the greater variety of the matters therein contained, and in the former Edition very briefly, and in many places obscurely set forth. If my pains herein may prove pro∣fitable to any, I shall think it well bestow∣ed; however I shall rest satisfied with this perswasion, That neither the Printers nor Readers can be prejudiced by these my well intended endeavours. William Style.

Account against a Guardian in Soccage. In what Court Account lieth against a Guar∣dian in Soccage. IT lies in the County Court or Common Bank. Nat. br. 117. b. It lies not before the Sheriff, 43 Edw. 3. fol. 21. pl. 11. Thorpe: For Brook, Account 14. saith, the Sheriff cannot assign Auditors, and therefore it is in vain to bring the Action before him.
A good plea to say the Land is ancient demesn, because the reality may come in question, Coke 5. part, fol. 105. A. Aldens case. It lies not in the Marshalsey: Coke 10. part, 74. b. Marshalsey. Who shall have a Writ against Guardian in Soccage. The Heir in ward shall maintain an Action a∣gainst him after the age of 14 years, or at his full age at his election. Littleton S. 123. But Nat. br. 118. b. he shall not have it till the age of 21 years. Crook fol. 131. pl. 106. by reason of the words of the Statute of Marlebridge, cap. 17. scil.

If the Heir in such case die before his full age, his Executor shall maintain an Action of Ac∣count, Crook 131. pl. 106. because it concerns a Chattel. Yet note, the Heir in Gavel-kind at 15 years brought an Account against a Guardian in Soc∣cage, and shews, by the Custome he may alien at such age; and for this cause he was awarded to Account, per Welby. 29 Edw. 3. fol. 5. pl. 13. For if he may do the greater, he may do the less; to fell is more than to take an Account. The Executor of an Heir shall have an Ac∣count,
per West. 2. cap. 23. Littleton 27. A. Crook 131. pl. 106. Executor of an Executor shall have an Ac∣count by 25 Edw. 3. cap. 23. Com. 290. Filius & Haeres Domini defuncti non habebit breve de computo, quia pertinet ad executionem ad∣ministrationis bonorum defuncti. Regist. Orig. 135. b A Recusant shall not have an action for any thing that is seized into the hands of the King, 3 Jac. cap. 5. for the King is accountablle to no body. Against what person an Account lieth as Guardian in Soccage. Account lieth against any that taketh the pro∣fits before the Ward be of the age of 14 years, Littleton Nat. br. 118. D. 4. Hen. 7.6. 10 Hen. 6.7. 13 Edw. 3. Account 77. 29 Ed. 3.5. pl. 13. But if one occupy, and after Guardian in Soc∣cage recover in right of the Ward, the party shall not render an Account to the Heir, for the Guardian ought to account for this, 27 Edw. 3.79. Gard. 22. and therefore the Account shall be made to the Guardian. The reason is (as it seems) that the Writ doth not make mention of the blood. Regist. orig. 136. b. neither the Count, Lib. Intra. Account lieth not against an Executor of a Guardian, Littleton. Nam non jacet versus Execu∣tores, quia merè pertinet ad Curam Christianam, cognoscere de computo reddendo versus Executores. Regist. orig. 135. b. 28 Hen. 8. Dyer 23. pl. 145.
But if Executors account, an Action of Debt lieth for the Arrearages, 2 Hen. 4.13. pl. 2. And if the Testator covenants to account to the Heir and doth not, Covenant lieth against his Executor, Regist. origin. 165. b. Nat. br. 145. H. It lies against a Woman, 19 H. 6. b. Newton. It lies against the Husband and Wife, 18 Ed. 3.55. pl. 76. For what things Account lieth. It lies for Woods and Under-woods sold, for Lands, Tenements, Meadow, Pasture; also for Rents and Services, perquisites of a Court ad valentiam. Lib. Intra. 21. B, & C. Marlebridge cap. 17.

Rot. 853. Shopland against Rider: the Guardian shall present, if the Heir be not of the age of discretion. It lies for Writings, 32 Edw. 3. Account 60. The Account against a Guardian in Soccage. The Heir counts, that it was ordained by the Common Council of the Land, that the Guar∣dian in Soccage should Account, &c. and shews the tenure specially, and that the Defendant had the custody of the Lands, &c. from such a day for 12 years ensuing, and hath not accounted for the issues and profits, &c. and that at such a day the Heir was at full age. Lib. Intra. 21. b. Sect. 1, 2.29 Ed. 3.4. pl. 13. No. Lib. Intra. 47 E. Sect. 3. The Writ against a Guardian in Soccage. Rex, &c. si A. fecerit, &c. tunc summon. &c.

Et ideo, &c. This Writ is founded per le Stat. de Marlebr. cap. 17. Nat. br. 118. A. Regist. orig. 136.
Note, this Writ lies against any one that occu∣pies the Land during the nonage of the Ward, whether it be the parents of the Heir or not, Re∣gist. origin. 136. b. for it makes no mention of the blood, but only of taking the profits. The Writ was Receptor denariorum: A good plea to the Writ, because he was Guardian in Soc∣cage, for otherwise he would be twice charged, 18 Edw. 4.3. pl. 17. viz. as a Receiver of his rents or profits of the Lands, and also as a Guardian in Soccage by the Statute. The Process against a Guardian in Soccage: 1. Before appearance. 2. After appearance. The Process at Common Law before appear∣ance was but a Distress infinite, Coke 3. part. 12. A. Herberts Case. But per Marlebridge cap. 23. a Capias was gi∣ven against a Baily, and per Westm. 2. cap. 11. ex∣igend. given against a Servant, Baily, Chamber∣lain, or any other Receiver, Coke 3. part 12. A. Herberts Case. And in Account against a Guardian there shall be a Capias, 29 Edw. 3.5. pl. 13. But no exigend. because this was given against a Receiver only, 17 Edw. 2.

The Barr by a Guardian in Soccage: 1. To the Action of Account. 2. Before Auditors in discharge. That he had the Custody till such a day from such a day, and accounted till the full age of the Plaintiff without that, that he was Guardian be∣fore or after, Lib. Intr. 21. cap. Sect. 2. It is a good Barr in discharge of the Account, that he expended so much for necessaries for the Plaintiff, ultraque, &c. Littleton. No Barr to say he was not next of Kin, for the occupation is the substance, and not the Kin∣dred, Littleton 29 Edw. 3.5. pl. 13. 22 Edw. 3.11. pl. 8. 4 Hen. 7.6. b. 10 H. 6.7. pl. 21. 13 Edw. 3.

The Judgment is, Ideo consideratum est, quod

Execution against Guardian in Soccage: 1. per Common Law, 2. per Statute Law. By the Common Law it was but a Levari fa∣cias or Fieri facias: Coke 3. part 12. A. Herberts Case. And this only within the year; for if the year passed, he was put to his Action of debt. If the Process were not continued, 33 Hen. 6.49. pl. 33. Per Westm. 2. cap. 45. Scire facias is given after the year. Per Westm. cap. 2.18. Elegit is given, Coke 3. part 12. a. Per Marlebridge cap. 23. & Westm. 2. cap. 11. Capias was given in Process and by consequence, Capias ad satisfaciendum: Coke 3. part 12. a. Per Westm. 2. cap. 11. If an Accountant be∣fore Auditors be found in Arrearages, he shall be by them committed to the next Goal in execu∣tion; but then they ought to commit him forthwith, Coke 8. part 119 b. Bonhams Case. 27 Hen. 6.8. Com. 17. But if an Account be before the Plaintiff, he ought not to commit him to prison; because the Statute saith, before Auditors, 45 Edw. 3.14 pl. 13. Ex parte talis. Westm. 2. cap. 11. If Auditors are assigned by the party, which will not allow to the Guardian

If one takes goods which appertain to the King, claiming them to his own use; yet the King shall have an account, Coke 11. part. 90. A. 33 Hen. 6.2. 35 Hen. 6.27. B. Nottingham. 8. Eliz. Dyer 249. pl. 83. For the right being disputable, the Law will judge the Kings claim to be true ra∣ther than the others; for the King can do no wrong in the eye of the Law. Two offer to be bound for A, that he shall serve the King truly in such an Office, and they present him to the King, and he doth not perform his Office, they shall account to the King, though they are not bound, Coke 11. part. 92. B. Devou∣shers case. 30 Edw. 3. Rott. 6. For the King re∣posed trust in them, and he shall not be prejudiced by them. If one be entituled to an action of Account, and be outlawed, the King shall have an Account for it, 28 Edw. 3.92. pl. 10. for he comes in the stead of the party outlawed. If one be indebted to the King and dies, the King shall have an account against his Executors or Tertenant, 5 Eliz. Dyer 225. pl. 33. At his Election Q. whether against both. Against whom Account lieth as Receiver. It lies not against a Prentice, Nat. br. 119. D. 7 Hen. 4.14. 8 Edw. 3.310. pl. 26. for there is no Writ in the Register against a Prentice, Coke
11. part. 89. B. Devoushers case; for a Prentice is not sui juris. Per a. Marlebridge, cap. 8. Churchwardens shall have an account against a Baily or head Constable, for amerciaments for Highways not repaired. It lies against the Husband for the receipt of the Wife, Nat. br. 118. F. for her Receipt is his Re∣ceipt. Q. If the Receipt was dum sola fuit it seems it doth. It lies against a Deputy of a Receiver, for he receives this to the use of his Master, Nat. br. 119. B. 4 Edw. 3.100. pl. 8. therefore the Master shall have account. It lies not against an Executor,Executor. Nat. br. 117. C. Littleton, Regist. orig. 135. B. quia mere pertinet ad curam Christianam cognoscere de computo reddendo versus executores, 48 Edw. 3.2. 4. Edw. 4.25. Q. But if an Executor will account, he shall be charged afterward, 2 Hen. 4.13. pl. 2.19. Hen. 6.5. A. Fortescue; for he hath waved the Spiritual Court. Note in the case of the King he shall have ac∣count against Executors, Littleton. For he may recover his right by what Law he pleaseth. It lieth not against an Infant, Nat. br. 118. D. because he hath not discretion to account, and so may wrong himself in his Account; and per. 21 Edw. 3.8. pl. 21. Regist. orig. 135. A. 26 Edw. 3.63. he cannot wage his Law, because he must perform his Law by taking his Oath. It lies against a Woman or Chaplin, Nat. br. 118. D. viz. a Feme sole. Churchwardens shall have an account against their Predecessors, 8 Edw. 4.6. pl. 5. for they are persons intrusted by the Parish.
Two being bound, both of them to Account, and each of them of the whole; quaere if Account lies against one only, 5 Edw. 3.141. pl. 8. It lies not against a Parish-Priest that hath the Offerings, for the Clark holds the vessel in which they are put, Nat. br. 119. E. 25 Edw. 3.46. pl. 32. vide 11 Rich. 2. Jurisdiction 18. and he is not tied to be responsable for his Clark. The King grants the Toll of a Village to the Inhabitants, and in the said Village there were certain Collectors to receive it, the Village shall have a Commission out of the Chancery against him that receives this Toll, to hear and determine it, and to hear their Accounts, &c. Nat. br. 119. F. If any takes the goods of the Kings Debtors which dies, the King shall have an Account against him, Coke 11. part. 93. A. For the Law creates a privity in case of the King, for the preservation of his Revenue. It lies for the King against a Debtor, or his Executors or Tertenents, 5 Eliz. Dyer 225. pl. 33. Com. 321. Mynes. But if one purchase to him and his Wife, and he become indebted to the King, and die, his Wise shall not be charged, 5 Eliz. Dyer 215. pl. 33. Contra, if he be first in debt, and purchase but a Chattel, 5 Assiz. pl. 5. For the Feme had an in∣terest in the Land made by the Husband, and she shall not be charged with her Husbands debt; but the Executor of the Husband. If one be an Accountant to the King, and be∣come indebted to the King, and afterward sell a Lease for years, the Vendee shall not be charged, because it is but a Chattel, Coke 8. par. 171. A. and
it was lawful for him to buy it, and might not know the Vendor to be an Accountant. One in debt to the King purchases Lands with the Kings money, to the use of some Friends in Fee per covin, and yet takes the profits, the King shall have the Lands in execution, 5 Mariae, Dyer 160. pl. 41.24 Edw. 3. Rot. 4. Coke 11. part. 92. B. Devoushers case. For the Law abhors Fraud in all parties, but especially where the King is concerned. For what things Account lieth against a Receiver. A. delivers three tuns of Wine to B. to sell, he shall have an Account against him for them; but then he ought to count of the receipt of every sum received of every several man, 43 Edw. 3.21. pl. 11. 46 Edw. 3.3. pl. 6. 46 Edw. 3.9. pl. 4. Hill. 43 Eliz. Com. Ban. Rot. 1707. Tresham against Ford. A indebted to B, and C indebted to B. A sends mo∣ney to B by his Servant, which accepts of it for the debt of C, and not for the debt of A; yet A shall have an Account against B, because he cannot accept of this in any other manner than the o∣ther tendered it, which was, to satisfie his own debt. If one receive money to my use he shall account for it, Nat. br. 117. q. 6 Hen. 4.7. pl. 33. Q. if he receive it against my will or consent. So if A deliver money to B, to deliver to me, Nat. 117. g. 13 H. 4. pl. 1. Hankeford, Nat. 138. A. I shall have an account, for it was delivered for my benefit: Q. if A shall not have an account. He which ought to pay me an Annuity, pays this to another to pay me, or if my Tenant pay it
to another to pay me, I shall have an account against him that received it, or I may charge my Tenant notwithstanding the delivery of it, so not a double remedy, 6 Hen. 4.8. pl. 33. A delivers Money to B beyond the Sea to be paid in England, he shall account for it to A, be∣cause the payment was to be made in England, and that was the ground of the delivery of it. Nat. br. 118. G. 41 Edw. 3.3. Money delivered to one upon the performing of a Condition, if the condition be not perform∣ed the money to be re-delivered, he shall account, Nat. br. 118. G. 41 Edw. 3.10. 18 Hen. 8. Dyer 22. pl. 135. 11 Hen. 6.39. pl. 31. for the Condition implies an Account, if not performed. A leases Tithes to B rendring Rent: A being indebted to C, assigns B to pay this. No account lieth for this, 5 Edw. 4.140, 141. for if it be not paid A may have his Action for the Rent, and B is not a Receiver in this case. If goods be devised to the King, account lieth for them, Coke 11. part 9. A. Devoushers case. For the King may use what Action he will to recover his right, and no injustice is done to any by this Prerogative. If one take goods of the Crown, and claim them as his own proper goods, yet he shall ac∣count for them, Coke 11. part. 90. A. 33 Hen. 8.2. 35 Hen. 6.27. B. 18 Eliz. Dyer. 249. pl. 83. For such taking doth not devest them out of the Crown; for though he may have right, yet such taking is not the proper way to recover them.
The Account against a Receiver, 1. by other hands; 2. by his own hands. The Account was, that he was a Receiver till such a time, until, &c. within which time he re∣ceived of the moneys of the Plaintiff 10 l. by the hands of B, and 10 l. by the hands of C; for B and C here shall be accounted but as Servants to A, except the contrary be shewn, Lib. Intra. 19. C, & D. 1, 2, 3. fol. 20. A. Sect. 4. Account of the Receipt of Moneys by the hands of the Wife and a Stranger not good, because they ought to have been several Issues, 43 Edw. 3.33. pl. 34. For the Receipt of the Wife is the Receipt of the Husband, and therefore as to her the account ought not to be per autre maine. Note the difference between the ballment of the Wife, and the Receipt of the Wife.But if the Account be of the delivery by the hands of the Wife of the Plaintiff, it had been good, 5 Edw. 3.146. pl. 6. Count of Bailment by the hands of a Servant of the Plaintiff, Hill. 4 Eliz. Com. Ban. Rott. 1707. Tresham versus Forde. And so it is of the delivery of a Stranger, and the Wife of the Plaintiff, 43 Edw. 3.33. pl. 34. Account that the Defendant sold a thing to A, and received 20 l. for it, and another thing to another, and received of him 10 l. this is nought, for the 10 l. and good for the remainder, 46 Edw. 3.3. pl. 6. Because it is not said to whom the other thing was sold; and so there can be no issue joyned. Viz. an Executrix,Baron and Feme count, that the Defedant fuit Receiver to the Testator from such a time to such a time, and received by the hands of B, &c. and did not account to the Testator neither to the
Executrix dum sola fuit, neither to them after the coverture. Lib. Intra. 20. A. Sect. 4. Account against a Husband upon the receipt of his Wife shall be by the Husbands own hands, Nat. br. 118. F. viz. the count shall be that the Husband receive it, for the receipt of the Feme is the receipt of the Baron. Bar in detinue is a bar in account, per Brian. 2 Rich. 3.14. pl. 19,Bar. for the one and the other affirm property, and suppose a detainer. The Defendant said,Coverture. that the Plaintiff at the time, &c. was under covert Baron, and this was good, 6 Edw. 3.184. pl. 5. Vide 18 Hen. 6.3. pl. 3. 2 Hen. 7.15. for then she had no power to sue. Delivery to another by the command of the Plaintiff Male,Delivery. for it is too general; but to say, that he was Baily to the Plaintiff to deliver to B. of the which he had a deed, this is good; be∣cause he had not confessed it by the account ren∣der, this being special matter of justification. 19 Hen. 6.5. pl. 10. 26 Hen. 49. pl. 7. 30 Hen. 6 5. pl. 4. 41 Edw. 3.31. pl. 37. Lib. Intra. 20. A. Sect. 5. Account against a Carrier, who said, that goods were delivered to him to deliver to B. which he had done without that he was Receiver in any o∣ther manner; this is a good bar, per custome d' Angleterre. Mich. 40, 41 Eliz. Com. Ban. Burrel versus Callice. So if the plt. deliver to one 20 l. to carry to the Lombard to be exchanged, and he brings a Bill of exchange for the money and traverseth, without that, that he was a Receiver for account render, for by this he doth not confess the receipt for Account-render, 5 Hen. 5.4. pl. 10. 28 Hen. 6.9. pl. 1.
3 Hen. 6.4. pl. 4. but justifies by a special Receipt. So if the Plaintiff deliver to one 20 l. to ob∣tain a discharge under the great Seal of the Cu∣stomes for 10 Hogsheads of Wine, the which he hath done; this is good, 30 Hen. 6.5. pl. 4. for the former reason. Re-delivery to the plt. without acquittance not good,Redelive∣ry. 39 Edw. 3.19. pl. 21. for he confesses thereby the Receipt, and therefore it is reason he should account. So if it be with an Acquittance, 3 Edw. 3.52. pl. 13. because by this he hath confessed the receipt for Account-render, and he may plead the Acquittance before the Auditors. But this is good before Auditors, 29 Edw. 3.35. pl. 1. in discharge of the Account, though it was not good in bar of the Action. The Defendant pleads, that he, as Messenger of the Plaintiff, received of C such a sum, being Provost to the Plaintiff, and this he paid and de∣livered to the Plaintiff, this is no bar to the A∣ction, because by the Receipt he is liable to the Account, 6 Edw. 3.185. pl. 7. 29 Edw. 3.20. pl. 11. but it may be in discharge of the account. An account of a Receipt by the hands of B. 1. of May till the first of July;Mort. it is no plea that B was dead the third of May, because he may re∣ceive this the second of May. 8 Hen. 6.32. pl. 28. and so accountable by his own shewing. A delivers 20 l. to B to redeliver;Obligati∣on. B binds himself to pay this; no bar in account, 4 Edw. 3.125. pl. 45. for the obligation is but additional security, and alters not the nature of the bail∣ment.
Defendant pleads,Payment. the Plaintiff being in his debt, commands him to receive of B so much to his own use as will satisfie his debt; which he doth without that, that he was his Receiver for Account-render, and good, Lib. Intra. 20. A, & B. sect. 6. 5 Edw. 4.29. B. Brian. For there is difference betwixt a receiving by way of satisfaction, which is to the Receivers use; and a Receipt per Account-render, which is for anothers use. But if he confess the Receipt upon account, and he commands him afterwards to retain the debt, this is no bar of the Account by reason of his confession; 28 Hen. 6, 7. pl. 9. No plea,Robbery. that he was Factor and was Robbed, in bar of the Action; but a good plea before Audi∣tors, Coke 4. part. 84. A. 41 Edw. 2.2. pl. 9. in discharge of the Account; yet quaere, if he was robbed by the Kings Subjects. Vendee and takes an obligation no bar, 28 Hen. 8. Dyer. 29. pl. 193.Vendee. for that is for his own security that made the sale, and not the Owner of the goods. Upon Receipt by others hands,Unison Receiver. a good plea that he was never Receiver by their hands, 10 Edw. 4.8. A. 7 Edw. 3.259. pl. 13. 8 Edw. 3.285. pl. 34. 7 Edw. 3.242. pl. 1. 24 Edw. 3.66. pl. 74. 25 Edw. 3.39. pl. 24. for this destroys the very gift of the action. But 5 Edw. 3.159. pl. 22. this is not good; but shall say generally, that he never was his Receiver. Q. Car moy semble c'est n'est ley, si il soit charger come Receiver per autre maine. If one testifie his Receipt by deed, he cannot plead, that he never was his Receiver, 10 Edw. 3.383.
pl. 18. for he is estopped by his own deed to plead so, the Law will believe a mans deed rather than his bare averment. Defendant pleads, that he is Executor of B, and that he received the money as a debt of B; this is not good, because the Plaintiff supposeth him his Receiver; but he ought to say without that, that he received it as the money of the Plaintiff, 11 Hen. 4.79. pl. 20. 13 Hen. 4. pl. 1. for such a traverse doth destroy the Plaintiffs supposal. Note, if the Receipt be by the hands of the Plaintiff, the Defendant may wage his law, 7 Edw. 3.269. pl. 52. viz. that he oweth him nothing, be∣cause it may be a thing acted in private betwixt them, where the Nay of the Defendant is as much to be credited as the Yea of the Plaintiff. So upon the delivery of the Wife of the Plain∣tiff, 13 Hen. 4.8. 43 Edw. 3.33. pl. 31. for Hus∣band and Wife are one person in Law. But upon a Receipt by other hands he cannot, 9 Eliz. Dyer 265. pl. 2. 22 Hen. 6.39. pl. 10. 5 Edw. 3.159. pl. 22. 33 Hen. 6.8. B. Moyle, because the Receipt lies in notice of the Countrey, upon which an issue may be joyned, and a trial had. An Executor brought an Account upon the delivery of the Testator, the Defendant cannot wage his Law, 7 Edw. 3.269. pl. 52. for the delivery and the receipt was not acted betwixt them. Outlawry of the Plaintiff after the Receipt a good bar,Outlawry. although he had a Charter of Pardon, 28 Edw. 3.92. pl. 10. for the Defendant is not bound to take notice of the Pardon until it be pleaded.
A good plea,Accord. that after the Receipt he married the Daughter of the Plaintiff, and it was then agreed, that he should keep the money, 12 Hen. 4.18. A. for by this agreement the former contract in Law is destroyed. So if that he put the money in a bag, and a∣greed that he should keep it in licu of a debt, 28 Hen. 8. pl. 9. for the same reason. Delivery and Re∣delivery.Delivery over by command of the Plaintiff, a good plea, 19 H. 6.5. pl. 10. Lib. Intr. 20. A. Sect. 5. 42. Edw. 6. pl. 21. for by this command the former trust is made void. A Re-delivery is a good plea without an Ac∣quittance,Re-delive∣ry. because he cannot compel the Plaintiff to make an Acquittance, because he received but his own goods, 29 Edw. 3.35. pl. 1. 6 Edw. 3.185. pl. 7. 29 Edw. 3.20. pl. 11. but it seems it may be a good plea before Auditors. Q. Expences reasonable shall be allowed to a Fa∣ctor,Expences. 3 Edw. 3.56. pl. 30. for the labourer is wor∣thy of his hire. A Factor pleads, that he was robbed, Coke 4. part. 84. A. Southcots case 41 Edw. 3.3. pl. 9. vid. Antea, Q. So for goods lost by Tempest, 3 Edw. 3.56. pl. 30. 41 Edw. 3.3. pl. 9. For here is the hand of God, which could not be avoided, and there∣fore the party not to be punished. So for goods sold under value, by reason of War, 3 Edw. 3.56. pl. 30. because of the necessi∣ty of the time.
Receipt in Satisfacti∣on.Defendant said, he received money in full sa∣tisfaction of a debt of another, &c. This was held void, because he did not name that he never was his Receiver, the which was sound before Hill. 43 Eliz. Com. Ban. Rott. 1707. Treshams case; so that his plea doth not answer the Plaintiffs Decla∣ration. Vendee of goods takes an obligation in the name of the Plaintiff,Vendee. a good plea, 28 Hen 8. Dyer 29. pl. 193. But then he ought to shew that the obligor was sufficient to pay at that time, 3 Edw. 3.56. pl. 30. The Judgment against a Receiver, 1. to Account; 2. to Recover. 2. The Judgment is, quod computet, & ideo in misericordia quia prius inde non computavit, Coke 11. part. 38. A. Metcalfs case, Lib. Intra 19. D. Sect. 1. Quod computet for parcel, and bar for the re∣mainder, Lib. Intr. 22. A. Sect. 2. for if there be just cause to account for part, the Action is main∣tainable. But if he confess part and traverse the other, no Judgment shall be till the other be tried, 41 Edw. 3. Account 34. for it may be he is to account for all notwithstanding his traverse, which may be false. The Judgment is, Ideo consideratum quod prae∣dictus W. recuperet versus praefat. M, so much as he is found in Arcarages, & dampna sua occasione implacitationis, &c. Coke 11. part. 40. A. Metcalfs case.
The King is not held to bring a particular Ac∣count against any as Receiver, but to declare ge∣nerally, quod ille ad computum domino Regi red∣dend. tenetur: and against Executors, quod tene∣bantur tempore mortis suae, Coke 11. part. 90. De∣voushers case; for the King is not tied to pun∣ctualities of Law, where no person is injured by his not observance of them. The Writ against a Receiver. In Comita∣tu.Rex, &c. pr. A, quod juste, &c. reddat B ratio∣nabilem computum suum de tempore quo fuit Re∣ceptor denariorum ipsius B,In Com. Ban. &c. Regist. orig. 135. & ibidem B. vide diversa brevia de computo versus Re∣ceptorem.Writat the Com. Law, by the Stat. of Marleb. cap. 29. But there is another form of a Writ founded upon the Statute of Marlebridge, cap. 23. Nat. br. 117. H. Regist. orig. 136. B. A good plea to the Writ, that he was Baily and not Receiver, for otherwise he shall be twice charged, viz. as Baily and Receiver, 3 Edw. 3.70. pl. 28. 18 Edw. 4.3. pl. 17. which the Law judges unreasonable, and will prevent by making the Writ certain. A good plea to the Writ, that he was Guardian in Soccage, 18 Edw. 4.3. pl. 17. and so not pro∣perly a Receiver, as the Writ supposeth. The Writ shall be always general, and if the cause be special, it shall be set forth in the Count, Nat. br. 118.Q. F. The Defendant pleads the Receipt by deed, and demands judgment of the Writ without shewing it, this is no plea to the Writ; because the Receipt and not the Deed is the cause of Action, and he
hath confessed the Receipt, and the Deed appears not to the Court, 1 Hen. 6.8. 28 Hen. 8. Dyer 20. pl. 121. But 9 Edw. 4.50. B. per Choke contra 2. Hen. 6.9. quaere. No plea to the Writ, if it do not agree with the Plaintiff concerning the manner of the Re∣ceipt, 4 Hen. 6.12. pl. 4. The Process against a Receiver, 1. before Ap∣pearance; 2. after. At the Common Law the Process was but a distress infinite, Coke 3. part. 12. A. Harberts case. But per Sat. de Marlebridge, cap 23. a Capias is given, Coke 3. part. 12. A. for more expedition; for Liberty is more precious than ones Estate in the eye of the Law. And by Westm. 2. cap. 11. Process of Outlawry is given, Coke 3. part. 12. A. 17 Edw. 3. Process 203. 17 Edw. 3.59. pl. 55. Shard, 26 Edw. 3.5. pl. 13. which is a more violent prosecution to bring the Defendant to do right. A Scire facias shall issue against Tenant per E∣legit to account, 21 Edw. 3.2. pl 6. 5 Edw. 3.159. pl. 20. Regist. Judicial, 73. B. Old Nat. br. 34. what profits he hath received out of the lands extended, and how far his debt is satisfied. And if he come not upon Summons returned, Judgment shall be given against him, 5 Edw. 3.159. pl. 20. 21 Edw. 3.1. Quod computet. Conusor of a Statute shall have a Scire facias against a Conusee to Account, Coke 4. part. 67. B 47 Edw. 3.11. pl. 9. & fol. 25. pl. 63. So the Assignee of a Conusor, 25 Edw. 3.53. pl. 17. both for the former reason upon the Elegit.
But then he cannot surmize, that it was ap∣praised and found of base value, 17 Edw. 3.36. pl. 6. For by the bringing of the Action he admits of a certain value to account upon, and such a surmize is a matter dehors. If a Receiver come in by a Capias or Exigend. he shall be forthwith committed to the Fleet, 29 Edw. 35. pl. 63. for his contempt in not coming in till compelled by force, which is a disturbance of the publick Peace, So if he come in by distress, and the account be adjudged against him, 29 Edw. 3.35. pl. 63. for then it doth appear he was a Fort feasor. But if the account be adjudged against him, and he be not present in Court, a Capias ad computan∣dum shall issue out, 1 Edw. 3.2. pl. 10. 1 Hen. 7.1. pl. 1. Townsend, Lib. Intr. 18. Sect. 1, 2, 3. to make it appear to the Court, whether he was to account or no. If in Judgment given quod computet, the Plain∣tiff dies, the Executor shall have a Scire facias, which being served, if the Defendant appear not, an Exigend. shall issue forth against him, 14 Hen. 4.1. But if the Defendant be taken per Capias ad computandum, and dies in prison, a Scire facias lies not against his Executors, 10 Edw. 4.7.41. Assize: So that a Scire facias lies for an Executor, but not against an Executor; for the Executor may not be so privy to the receipts and payments of the Testator, as to know what to plead to the Account.
Bar by a Receiver, 1. to an Action of Account; 2. before Auditors. The Defendant pleads, he bought the goods of the Plaintiff,Bought. before he brought this Action for them, a good bar, 14 Hen. 4.19 pl. 21. for thereby he claims the property in them. The Defendant pleads,Accord. that it was agreed that he should be bound to the Plaintiff for the prin∣cipal and use, the which he did; this is a good bar to the Action, 22 Hen. 6.55. pl. 32. for this drowns the former contract: otherways he ought to plead this before Auditors. Q. Whether it may be pleaded in bar of the Action, or in dis∣charge of the Account before Auditors. It seems it is no plea before Auditors. So if the Plaintiff grant, that if the Defendant pay 20 l. he will withdraw his Action; this is a good bar to the Action, because of this Accord, 7 Edw. 3.325. pl. 11. 18 Edw. 3.39. pl. 35. which hath taken away the ground of the Action. No plea, that he put it in a bag, and that the Plaintiff agreed that he should keep it in lieu of a debt; because the Receipt for Account-render is confessed, 28 Hen. 6.7. pl. 9. and so it appears the Plaintiff hath cause of Action. The Plea was, that he did account of such a Sum such a day, and year, and place, before A and B, Auditors assigned by the Plaintiff, a good Bar, Lib. Intra. 19. D. Sect. 3. 25 Edw. 3.39. pl. 1. 2 Edw. 3.45. pl. 13. For they are Judges, and so shall not account twice for one sum.
The Plaintiff Counts of divers sums received between such and such a day, and the Defendant pleads to parcel of the time, that he hath fully accounted, and to the remainder, that he was not his Receiver; there he ought to shew of what he had accounted, 30 Edw. 3.1. pl. 4. for otherwise his plea is too general, incertain, and captious, which the Law will not permit. That he accounted to the Plaintiff from three months to three months, and so to the time of the action, a good Bar, 39 Edw. 3.5. pl. 22. A good bar that he did Account 1o April; but then he ought to say, without that, that he w his Receiver after, 21 Edw. 4.66. pl. 47. 7 Hen. 4.14. pl. 17. 45 Edw. 3.14. pl. 13. 34. Hen. 6.44.

As to 20s. received 1o Jun. fully account for, and to the Receipt afterward, or before th he never was Receiver, 27 Hen. 6.1. pl. 8. a goo plea. A good bar quod 21. Januarii Anno, &c.  D, in the County of W, he fully accounted wi the Plaintiff, Lib. Intra. 20. B. Sect. 8, 9, 10, 11. Be¦fore the Writ brought he did account with th Plaintiff, a good bar, 4 Hen. 6.43. pl. 4.

For the Plaintiff cannot commit him to prison, for Westm. 2. cap. 11. gives this power only to the Auditors, 45 Edw. 3.14. pl. 13. who are the Judges. To an Account brought by Executors it is a good bar, that the Defendant did account to the Testator, and shew his Acquittances, 1 Edw. 3.2. pl. 10. for then the Executors have no colour of action. The Defendant pleads an award made by Ar∣bitrators, that he should re-deliver the goods, this is nought; but if he had been charged only with the safe custody of them, then good, 2 Hen. 5.2. pl. 6. For the Defendant is chargeable to Account for the provent of the goods, as well as for the goods themselves. Account upon a Receipt by other hands, Arbi∣trement is a good bar, 22 H. 6.39. pl. 10. For the submission to the Arbitrement creates a new Con∣tract. Execution against a Receiver, 1. per Common Law; 2. per Statute Law. 1. By the Common Law it was but a Levari facias, or Fieri facias, Coke 3. part. 12. A. Harberts case; to levy the arrears upon his Lands, or Goods and Chattels. Q. And this only within the year; for if the year was past, then an Action of debt only lay upon the Judgment. Unless the Process be continued, 33 Hen. 6.49. pl. 33. For the Court will not grant out Execu∣tions upon sleeping Judgments, for this may prove dangerous. 2. Per Westm. 2. cap. 45. a Scire facias is given
after the year, Coke 3. part. 12. A. upon the Judg∣ment against the Defendant, to shew why he should not pay the Arrears due to the Plaintiff by the Judgment. Per Marlebridge, cap. 23. & Westm. 2. cap. 11. a Capias was given in Process, and by consequence a Capias ad satisfaciendum in execution, Coke 3. part. 12. A. Lib. Intra. 18. C. Sect. 1, 2, 3. which are both to lay hold on the person of the Defendant. Per Westm. 2. cap. 11. if the Accountant before Auditors be found in Arrearages, he shall be com∣mitted by them to the next Goal in execution: the same law is, if he will not account before the Au∣ditors, 10 Edw. 3.387. pl. 28. when he is adjudged by the Court to do it. But this shall be forthwith, Coke 8. part. 119. B. Bonhams case, 27 Hen. 6.8. Com. 17. for the Sta∣tute being penal must be strictly pursued. But if he account before the Plaintiff he can∣not commit him to Prison; for the Statute saith before Auditors, 45 Edw. 3.14. pl. and no impri∣sonment lay before the Statute. But an Accountant to the King shall be impri∣soned, and his goods and lands in execution per the Common Law, Coke 3. part. 12. B. 5 Eliz. Dyer 224.

It lies against Baron and Feme,Baron and Feme. for not repair∣ing Seabanks upon the Land of his Wife, 7 Hen. 4.31. for the tort is done by the Husband as well as by the Wife. Trover and Conversion lies against Baron and Feme for the Conversion of the Feme, for it is a disloyal act: which his Wife may do, Mich. 7 Jac. Ban. Regist. Drapers case; and so an Action upon the Case lies not. Trover and Conversion lieth not against a Car∣rier for a delivery to his Servant,Carrier. but an Action upon the Case, Pasch. 9 Jac. Ban. Reg.

Stop∣ping of it.If the whole way be stopped by one that is not owner of the Soil, it lies, 22 Hen. 5. 33 Hen. 6.26. 10 Hen. 7.21. For I am wholly deprived of my easement, and no other Action lies against him. So if Tertenant and others stop it, 34 Hen. 6.4. tamen quaere as to the Tertenant. For against Tertenant that stops all the way an assize of Nusance doth lie, and not this Action, 22 Hen. 6.14. 3 Eliz. Dyer 250. pl. 88. 19 Hen. 6 29. pl. 49. Paston. 2 Hen. 4.11. pl. 48. No. Lib.

For he can claim no inheritance in the Land where the way lies. If A stops my way, and leases the Land to B, it lies against B, if he do not open it, for conti∣nuing of the wrong; but if A build a House and leases it to B, there B cannot pull it down for to lay open my way, for this is waste in B. Trin.
13 Jac. Regis, Bolds case, and Rutlandshiers case; and therefore an Action lies not against B for not pulling down the house, for that were unreason∣able. But by 11 Hen. 4. an Action upon the case lies for stopping of a way in gross only, and an assize of Nusance for a way appendant. 21 Edw. 3.2.6. 34 Hen. 6.4. pl. 11. Note the difference, one savours of the realty, the other is but personal. But for stopping of a way in my own Land Trespass vi & armis lies, and not this Action, 31 Edw. 3. Action upon the Case 38. 13 Hen. 7.26. For there is a plain breach of the Peace by di∣sturbing my possession. But for stopping of a Highway the Desendant shall be punished in the Leet, and not by this A∣ction, unless the party had a special loss; for a special loss admits of a special remedy, 27 Hen. 8.26. 5 Edw. 4.2. b. 7 Edw. 4 8. 33 Hen. 6.26. Coke 5. part. 73. A. Williams case. 21 Hen. 7.35. Coke 9. part. 113. Mayrs case. For a Court Leet is to re∣dress such publick grievances. Slander of my Title.If A says, that B hath right in my Land for years an Action lies, Coke 1. part. 177. Mildmays case. No. Lib. Intr. 30. A. sect. 27. but I ought to shew how I am prejudiced by his saying so, or else it lies not, for his lye were it a trespass only, the Law will not punish it. A brought an Action upon the Case against B, because that B published and declared falsly, that he had the Lease of the Land of A, and that he in∣tended to sell his Land, and was thereby hindred; B said, that he had an Indent. of Lease, as in the Count is mentioned, and traverseth that he forged it not,
1. when B claims a right, though he had none; yet the Action lies not, for it appears not whether he had a right or not; 2. the Count is good, be∣cause it is, that it was against the knowledge of B that it was forged; 3. Sciens is not traversable, Coke 4. part. 18. A. case 14. See the Case at large. For stopping a Ditch by which my land is sur∣rounded with water, Nat. br. 88.

Boulstons case; and it is lawful for me to kill them if they come upon my ground. Q. tamen in regard of the trouble. If one hath a Bakehouse by Prescription,Trade. and I set up another by him to his prejudice; for the Law favours and protects ancient Rights, presu∣ming they had lawful commencements. 1. For disturbing my Baily to distrain for an amercement,Distress. 18 Hen. 6.9. pl. 20. for the wrong is done to me; for the Baily is my Servant, and acts for my benefit. 2.

3. For distraining more Suitors to come to my Leet than ought to be, Nat. br. 94. G. Coke 4.94. B. Regist. orig. 103. B. for the Law hates need∣less troubles and vexations. 4.

Sander of my Title.If A says that B hath right in my Land for years an Action lies, Coke 1. part. 177. Mildmay case, No. Lib. Intra. 30. A. Sect. 27. but I ought to shew how I am prejudiced particularly, else there appears no cause of Action. A brought an Action upon the case against B, because that he published, that he had the lease of the Land of A, and that he intended to sell it and was hindred; B said, that he had an Inden∣ture as in the Count is mentioned, and traverseth that he forged it, 1. when B claims a right, though he had none, yet the Action lies not, for it may be he thought he had a right, and so there cannot be said any malice. 2. The Count is good, because it is that it was against the knowledge of B that it was forged. 3. Sciens is not traversable, Coke 4. part. 18. A. case 14. 1.

It ought to have the same certainty as the Count, and to have the effect of all the Count except the year and day, the quantity and cer∣tainty of the Land, 38 Hen. 6.9. pl. 20. Prisott▪ for the Land comes not in question. Q. The Writ shall not be vi & armis, Nat. br. 92. E. for it supposeth not the breach of the publick Peace, but only a particular dammage. When there are two causes of Actions, 1. caus causans, 2. causa causata, the former may be al∣ledged vi & armis, Coke 9. part. 50. B. Salop▪ case: For that is but as an inducement to the cause of action, upon which the Action is brought. The Process, 1. before appearance; 2. after. At Common Law a Capias lieth not, 43 Edw. 3.11. Coke 10. part. 72. A. Marshalsey; for liberty was preferred before private wrongs, which con∣cerned the estate only.

B. It must be sure grounded on a reasonable cause of fear. 1. For arresting me in the name of B,Arrest. without his consent, 7 Hen. 6 43. pl. 19. for it may be he would not have arrested me, though he had cause. 2. For arresting me without cause, 8 Edw. 4.13. But this ought to be by collusion to vex me, 43 Edw. 3.20. for if there be probabilis causa it lies not, for one may be deceived in the Law. 3. For arresting me to appear in the Marshal∣sey, where I was not sued, 3 Hen. 6. estoppel 18. 10 Hen. 6.13. 7 Hen. 6.30. for this is vexa∣tious. 4.

Against a Sheriff for returning me nibil where I had lands, by which I was taken per Capias, Nat. br. 93. b. 31 Edw. 3. Process 55. for his false return to my prejudice. For arresting me and bringing me before a Ju∣stice, where I was indicted and acquitted, and this is good cause of Action although the time of the arrest is not shewed, because of the vexation, Trin. 7 Jac. Ban. Regis, Olivers case, which is the
cause of the Action, and the time is not mate∣rial. If one exhibit Articles to a Justice of Peace a∣gainst B,Articles. to have him bound to his good Behavi∣our, no Action lies for this, because it is in course of Justice, Coke 4. part. 14. B. But quaere if the Articles be false. For putting Irons and putting in the Stocks,Goaler. and giving little sustenance to one committed for Debt, or Arrearages in Account, Nat. br. 83 H. for the Law warrants it not, and the Law hates cru∣elty. For procuring another to be indicted without cause,Indict∣ment. Nat. br. 114. D. 116. A. viz. probable cause. For procuring B to be indicted for a common Barector, and he is acquitted secundum Leges An∣gliae, 1. good, although that the Count was not, that he was lawfully acquitted, for it is so implied; 2. he ought to have Counted quod inde acquieta∣tus fuit, or words that do amount to so much, Mich. 7 Jac. Ban. Regis, Rott. 407. Bell versus Gam∣ble; for else there appears no cause of Action. For threatning by word or writing to beat me,Menace. if I come out of my house, 17 Edw. 3.4. vide Bracton, lib. 3. cap. 4. fol. 1.13. B. for I am thereby hindered in my occasions, and so damnified. For threatning another of life and member, 10 Edw. 4 6. the Writ and Count, Lib. Intra. 661. B. sect. 1, 2. for he thereby goes in fear, and so the Peace is disturbed.

Against a Chirurgion that impairs the body by his Medicine, 21 Hen. 6.55. 11 Rich. 2. Action upon the case 37. For it is either a misfeasance of ignorance or of malice, both which are punisha∣ble on those that undertake a trust and skill. For doing a thing to the damage of another touching his Name, which is Slander; for it turns to his prejudice. Dicitur quod scandalosum est generale verbum,Slander. and signifies that which one does to the overthrow of anothers credit and repute; therefore it is con∣ceived, that if the words are spoken to the wrong of another, an Action lies, Kitchin 173. for the intended injury. Fit autem injuria non solum cum quis pugno per∣cussus fuit, verberatus, vulneratus, vel fustibus cesus, verum cum ei convitium dictum fuit, vel de eo fa∣ctum crimen famosum, & hujusmodi. Bracton, lib. 3. fol. 155. A. There are two kinds of defamations, Spiritual and Temporal, Nat. br. 55. Note, when words are not spoken adjectively, if they touch one in his Profession or Trade they are actionable, otherwise not, Coke 4. part. 19. case 15. Q. Adjective words are incertain, and signifie nothing positively or directly affirmative. Also if they imply or presume an illoyal act, viz. against the publick Peace, then an Action lies although they are spoken adjectively; but if they imply an intention only, then an Action lies not, Coke 4. part. 19. B. case 15. for the Law puni∣sheth not Intentions, except it be in cases of Trea∣son.
It lies not for calling one Adulterer,Adulterer. because it belongs to the Spiritual Court, 27 Hen. 8.17. Coke 4. part. 17. case 11. but now it doth, because Adul∣tery is made death by a late Statute. 1. For calling a man Bankrupt it lies not,Bankrupt. unless a man be a Merchant, or use a Trade, or get his living by buying and selling, Pasch. 40 Eliz. Bc∣kard & Constable; it was there doubted, then one Case was cited in Ban. Regis, that it did not lie. 2. For saying that B will be a Bankrupt within two days, it lies, 6 Edw. 6. Dyer 72. pl. 6. Coke 4. part. fol. 19. for he is impaired in his credit, for none will trust one that is likely to break. 3. A shews that he was a Shoemaker, and did use to buy and sell per 10 years; the Defendant said that he was a Bankrupt, and this was good al∣though he did not shew that he was a Shoemaker for 10 years, for it is implied in that he said, he used to buy and sell per 10 years, Mich. 9 Jac. Ban. Regis, Dayet, Chandler. 4. For calling a Merchant Bankrupt-Knave it lies, because it toucheth him in his Profession, Coke 4. part. 19. A, & B. in both the words. 1. For calling one Bastard, if he be an Heir,Bastard. No. Lib. Intr. 28. sect. 25. Trin. 25 Eliz. Ban. Regis. Q. if he be not an Heir, and no special damage laid. 2. A intends to present B to a Church, and C says that he is a Bastard, by which he is not pre∣sented, B shall have an Action, Coke 4. part. 17. case 11. for here is a particular damage laid. For calling one Bawd it lies not,Bawd. 27 Hen. 8. Kitchin 173. because it belongs to the Spiritual Court. —if it be spoken in London it lies;
And me seems the same Law, if it be in the Coun∣trey. A said to B your Attorney is a bribing Knave,Bribery. Action lies because it toucheth him in his Pro∣fession, Mich. 11 Jac. Com. Ban. Yardly & Ellil. Q. For a bribing Knave is one properly that gives bribes, and not a taker of bribes; but that is not fair practise. A said of an Attorney, you are well known to be a corrupt man, and to deal corruptly, Action lies, Coke 4. part. 16. case 6. for he is scandalized in his profession. For calling a man Common Misseasor or Bare∣ctor,Barector. it lies not, Kitchin 173. A. vide 22 Assiz. 43. Q. tamen of the word Barector. 1. For calling a man Cousener it lies not,Cousener. Coke 4. part. 15. B. Q. 2. Thou art a Cousening Knave, and hast cou∣sened my two kinsmen of Land worth 6000 l. and I will bring thee to stand upon the Pillory for it, the Action lies not, Kitchin 173. B. Q. tamen, for for calling one Cheater lately adjudged actionable in B. S. in Parkhurst and Bramptons case, by Glon. Chief Justice. 3. A is a Cousening Knave, and I have proved him a Cousening Knave for selling me a Saphir for a Diamond, it lies not, Kitchin 174. A. Q. if the words were spoken of a Goldsmith or Jeweller. 4. If Sir John S. might have his will, he would kill all true Subjects and the King, and he is a maintainer of Papists and Rebellious persons; up∣on Not guilty the Jury found that he said, I think in my Conscience ut supra, &c. 1. the words are actionable, for scandalum dicitur quod parit rui∣nam
vel occasionem ruinae, 2. the Jury found the substance and no variance, Mich. 14 Jac. Regis, Sydenham & May; one must not tell his thoughts to prejudice another. Thou art an Enemy to the State of this Realm, an Action lies, Hill. 40 Eliz. Com. Ban. Hooknell & Smith. Q. tamen, for the words seem very du∣bious. It lies for writing a Libel in a paper,Slander in writing. and affix∣ing it to the Church-door, by which I am to enter, 17 Edw. 4.3. Lib. Intr. 13 B. sect. 4. for it is in effect speaking of Scandalous words. False Ju∣stice.For calling one false Justice of Peace it lies, 4 Edw. 6.22. if spoken in relation to his Of∣fice. False Knave.It lies not for calling a man false Knave, Kitchin 173. B. for the word Knave is a general word, and a word of heat. False suit.1. It lies not for suing a man for Forgery, 11 Eliz. Dyer 245. Because for false Action sequitur nulla poena, 2 Rich. 3.9. for if the Action be false the Defendant shall have his damage pro falso clamore. For this is in course of Justice, Coke 4. part. 14. B. And if it would lie, men would be terrified from punishing Vice. 2. But if one be sued in the Star-chamber for a thing not examinable, there an Action lies, Coke 4. part. 14. B. case 3. No. Lib. Intr. 23. B. sect. 21. For Actions are to be brought in the Courts proper to try them, and not in Arbitrary Courts. Ergo Q. whether an Action upon the Case doth not lie for suing in Chancery, where a plain Action lies at the Common Law.
3. But if one bring an Appeal in Com. Ban. it lies not, because this is in the nature of a Legal suit, though brought in a wrong Court. 1. For calling a Judge a Felon,Felon. 30 Assize 19. Kitchin 173. A. for Felony is Capital. It lies for saying that one had forged a Deed,Forger. 11 Eliz. Dyer 285. for Forgery is indictable. 1. For calling one Heretick it lies not,Heretick. because it properly belongs to the Spiritual Court, 27 Hen. 4.17. Regist. orig. 54. Coke 5. part. 57. B. Specotts case.

A borrowed a Horse of B,Borrowed. which died sudden∣ly without his default, Action lies not, 40 Edw. 3.36. for this is the act of God, and not the faul of the borrower. It lies not against an Attorney that will not do his office unless he be retained,Attorney. 20 Hen. 7.9. for he is but in the nature of a Servant, and is not bound to be retained.

Against my Servant, because he pays not mo∣ney for bailing and saving harmless, 20 Hen. 6.9. for I may be damnified thereby.

For the not doing of a thing which ought to be done by the agreement of the party to the damage of another, touching things hereditary. Assumpsit. Quid. Quotuplex.ASsumpsit is either by word, or deed Poll. If it be by Covenant it lies, and needs not any consideration to be averred, 2 Hen. 7.11. 21 Hen. 6.55. for a Covenant supposeth a consideration, because it is a solemn act. If it be by word, then it ought to be upon a consideration, otherways it is but Nudum pactum unde non oritur actio, for the other hath no wrong, though the promise be not performed. A Consideration is a cause or occasion merito∣rious,Considera∣tion. Quid. Quotuplex. requiring mutual recompence in deed or in Law; in Deed expressed in words; in Law not expressed, but created by Law, 16 Eliz. Dyer 336. B. pl. 34. The Consideration is either expressed in words, or implied by Law; in every Contract there is an Assumpsit or promise implied by Law, Coke 4. part. 94. Slades case.
If it be expressed it ought to be shewed in the Count or Declaration, 3 Hen. 6.36. 11 Hen. 4.33. A Consideration of a thing past is not good, Doct. & Stud. 104. B. except it be a continuing consideration and benefit to the party. An Assumpsit may be made in the absence of another, if he will agree to it afterward, 27 Hen. 8.24. and it shall be all one as if it were made to the party. Quaere, whether he that assumed may not refuse before the other consent. General Bar. 1. Concord pleaded, viz. after the Assumpsit made, Lib. Intr. 6. C. sect. 6. 2. Non assumpsit, and this a man may plead al∣though there is no consideration, Pasch. 26 Eliz. Ban. Regis; for if there was no consideration for the promise, it is all one as if there had been no such promise made. But if the former were upon an entire sum upon two Assumpsits, then no bar, Trin. 14 Jac. Ban. Regis, Paine and Selley. A good Bar that he promised upon Condition, which is not performed, Lib. Intr. 5. D. sect. 1. and so he is not bound to perform his promise, for the Condition is to be precedent. Non emisses the Land of him, a good bar, Lib. Intra. 6. B. sect. 5. viz. an Action brought for mo∣neys promised to be paid upon a purchase of lives. That the Plaintiff discharged him of the bar∣gain, a good bar, Lib. Intr. 685.

Against him that sells Land to me, and pro∣mises to give me seisin of it, and does not, Regist. 112. A. for he hath consented to pass the Land by that kind of Conveyance. 3. A promises to convey Land to such a person as B shall name, and the Defendant shews, that he conveyed it to B, this is good; for it shall be in∣tended a nomination in B, insomuch that he did accept of it, Mich. 13 Jac. Com. Ban. Huligo and Wilde; for he might nominate himself as well as another. 4. Against him that first sells Land to me, and afterwards sells it to another, Lib. Intra. 685. B. sect. 1. Nat. br. 98. F. 20 Hen. 6.34. for I may be thereby troubled in my possession. 5. The same Law is, if he grant a Rent, and after∣wards infeoff me, not giving me notice of the Rent, 20 Hen. 6.34. for thereby my Land is charged.

And it being a Lease for years, ergo the Action lies not, Mich. 9 Jac. Ban. Regis, Coventry & Woody. Q. Against him that promises to purchase Land for me of B, and doth not do it,Purchase. he is not excused though B will not sell it, 11 Hen. 6.18. 3 Hen. 7.14. for by his promise he is bound to do it at his peril.

Against him that promises an agreement,Arbitre∣ment. and doth it not, Coke 5. part. 77. B. Sammons casee. Ne. Lib. Intra. 3. B. sect. 4. for the other thereby is de∣laied in his right. A grants his term to B, if C agree, B promises 20 l. to C for his assent,Assent. this is a good assumpsit, Trin. 12 Jac. Com. Ban. in the case of Griesly and Louther; for the assent shall be intended to be for his benefit. 1. Against one that promises to re-deliver mo∣ney, and doth not, Lib. Intr. 10. sect. 1. 2. Against a Baily that takes upon him to keep Cattel safe, and doth not, Lib. Intra 9. A. sect. 1. & fol. 3. B. sect. 1. but they are lost by his negligence. 3.

Against him who promises to make a Coach,Coach. and doth not, Nat. br. 94. A. But the Plaintiff ought to count, that he did give money for the doing it, other ways it is but Nudum pactum, unde non oritur actio, 3 Hen. 6.36. pl. 33. for there was not reason why he should do it. Gathering Tithes. A promises, if B will assist him in the gather∣ing of the Tithes of Cheese, and Apples, and other Tithes till such a time, he should have 20 s. and B shews, that he did assist him so long in the gathering the said Tithes, and good; for non constat that there are other Tithes, if there be they ought to be shewed by the other party, Mich. 7 Jac.

Delivery of a deed.A promises to deliver a deed upon request, the request ought to be shewed precisely, otherways if it be of a thing due before, or upon a sale; for in the former case the request is traversable, but not in the latter, Pasch. 28 Eliz.

Against a Smith that takes upon him to shoe my Horse, and doth not, 14 Hen. 6.18. 2. Or to cure him, 19 Hen. 6.49. Regist. orig. 119. B. but here must be a consideration prece∣dent. It is not sufficient to do all he can, but he is bound to cure him: But upon a general retainer, without taking upon him the Cure, it is not so; for there the Law implies only, that he would do his best endeavour to do it, 43 Edw. 3.33. 45 Edw. 3.17. 48 Edw. 3.6. 27 Assize 56. And the Writ shall not say contra pacem, 43 Edw. 3.33. 3. Quare tam negligenter & improvide imposuit medicinas, &c. quod equui mortuus est, 43 Edw. 3.33. pl. 38. 19 Hen. 6.49. for the Law punnisheth negligence. 1. Against a Ferryman that takes upon him to carry one over the water,Ferryman. and doth it not, and
this without consideration, because his fare is cer∣tain, 22 Assize 41. and recoverable by Law; for the Law makes the Contract. 2. For surcharging his Boat, by which my Beast is drowned, 22 Assize 41. Action upon the Case 40. for this is a misseasance. An Administratrix desires to be forborn till such a time, and then she will pay the debt;Forbear∣ance. this is a good assumpsie, Coke 9. part. 94. A. Banes case; and the Plaintiff needs not say in the Count that she hath assets, for it shall be intended; but it ought to be given in evidence, for she is not charge∣able if she have not quid pro quo, Coke 9. part. 92, 93, 94. Banes case, & fol. 90. B. Pinchons case. The same Law is of a Strangers promise,Forbear∣ance. Coke 9. part. 94. A. for though the Stranger it may be hath no benefit, yet the Plaintiff may be preju∣diced. But then he ought to shew that the Plaintiff agreed to it, Mich. 39 Eliz. Com. Ban. Milwards case. Then the Count ought to shew how the debt grew due, Coke 10. part. 77. A. Marshalsea; for if there were no debt, there can be no cause of A∣ction. A counts that B was indebted to him in 20 l. but shews not how long; and that the 10. of Sep∣tember 7 Jac. B. promises, if the Plaintiff would not arrest him, but forbear till the 21. of Sep∣tember he would pay him; and sets forth, that he did forbear so long per Curiam: if the Plaintiff counts of the forbearance for a certain time, there it is good, without shewing when the debt grew due; but otherways when the forbearance is for a
time uncertain, Trin. 9 Jac. Ban. Regis, Dean & Nuby. Q. differentiam. The Count was, that the Intestate was indebt∣ed to him in a 100 l. and the Administrator in consideration of forbearance for a reasonable time assumes to pay, and upon non assumpsit pleaded it was found for the Plaintiff; 1. Coke Chief Ju∣stice said, forasmuch as the Intestate was indebted, and the Administrator promised, &c. and pleaded non assumpsit, it shall be intended he had notice of the debt, therefore good; to which there was no answer: 2. forbearance by a reasonable time is a good consideration, because the Court may judge of it: but forbearance per paululum temporis is not good, to which the Court agreed, Trin. 14 Eliz. Ban. Regis, Lingill & Broughton; for the Court cannot judge of it, because it is incertain. The Count was, that where A. was indebted to him in 32 l. for which he sued A. and that it was agreed between him and A. to stay the suit, and if he payed it not before Mich. he should give se∣curity; 1. he need not shew how the debt grew due, because the forbearance is the cause of Acti∣on, but otherways when the Testator is indebted and promises, for there the debt is the cause of the Action; 2. Coke Chief Justice, that he needs not shew, that he did surcease his suit, because it was but a reciprocal agreement; but if A. in con∣sideration that the Plaintiff shall surcease his suit promises to pay it, then he ought to shew that he did surcease, Pasch. 14 Jac. Ban. Regis, Fullers case; for that is the ground of the Action. W indebted to B, delivers goods to L to pay him, L prays B to stay 2 or 3 days, and he will
pay him, L pays it not, B shall have an Action against L; for it is a good consideration, insomuch that L had goods to satisfie, Mich. 7 Jac. Ban. Regis, Brande & Lister, by his own confession implied in his assumpsit. A pledges goods to B for money, and if A pay not at such a day, that B shall have the goods after and afore the day, &c. C requests B to for∣bear till another day and he would pay it, B may have an Action against C, if he pay it not; for if C pay the money, then he may have a Detinue against B for the goods, for by the payment C had a special property, Trin. 13 Jac. Ban. Regis, Capper & Dickinson; per Coke Chief Justice. Against a Goaler that promises to the Sheriff to keep safe his Prisoners, and lets them escape,Goaler. Regist. 110. A, & B. for the Sheriff is answerable for the safe custody of the Prisoners within his County. Against him that warrants for 10 l. that my Boat shall come safe upon the Thames,Warranty. 34 Hen. 8. br. Action upon the Case 107. and it doth not; for there ought to be quid pro que. A Leases to B rendering Rent,Lessor. and paying all out-Rents and making reparations; the Lessor in consideration of this, promises defendere & susten∣tare statum & possessionem of the Lessee, quiete & pacifice absque interruptione; 1. here is a good consideration: 2. the said Clause amounts to so much as if he had said, that the Lessee shall quietly enjoy his Term, Mich. 7 Jac. B. R. Gamble & Terrell. Marriage money.1. Against him that promises in Marriage 10 l. if he marry his daughter, No. Lib. Intr. 2. B. sect. 2, & 4. B. sect. 1. Doct. & Stud. 104. A. 16 Hen. 3. Prohi∣bition 22. for the Marriage is a good considera∣tion.
2. A being to marry B, C living with A. says to B, if she should marry A and his Father do not make such a Joynter to her, he would give her a 100 l. B marries A, the Joynture is not made, A and B shall have an Action against C; for perad∣venture the marriage had not taken effect, but in regard of the promise of C, Mich. 29 of Eliz. Ban. Regis. 3. A promises to B 100 l. in consideration that B marrie his Daughter; this is a good considera∣tion, insomuch that the advancement continues, being even as in Frank-marriage after the marri∣age is good, Trin. 29 Eliz. Ban. Regis, Marche & Rayneforde. 4. A promises to B, that whereas his Son was a Suiter to his Daughter, if B would give his as∣sent A would give to B 50 l. This is a good consi∣deration, 1. because the Daughter ought to have the consent of her Parents; 2. because the Son of A was to have advancement by the marriage, Trin. 12 Jac. Com. Ban. Greicely & Louther. Q. whether a man shall be intended to be advanced by marriage, except it be shewn. 5. A promises 50 l. to C, if he marries B. In an Action upon the case for the 50 l. he is not bound to shew that he did give notice of the marriage, neither to make request, Mich. 7 Jac. Ban. Regis, Brently & Tod; for A might as well take notice of the marriage as B, and the bringing of the A∣ction is a request in Law. 6. A having speech with El. Stukely about marriage with her, promiseth to M. the Daughter of the said Eliz. that if she marry him without disposing of her estate, he will give to M in mar∣riage
40 l. and in an Action brought upon this, insomuch that she did not averr in his count, that she had not disposed of her estate, it was not good, Mich. 15 Jac. Ban. Regis, Kings case; for that was the sole consideration. Obtains a Lease.Against him that promises to obtain a Lease for me for 10 l. and gets it for himself, 3 Hen. 7.14. Quaere, whether an Action of Deceit doth not lie. A in consideration of divers sums received of divers persons to the use of the Plaintiff amount∣ing to 24 l. assumes to pay this,Payment. and adjudged a good count, though he doth not shew of whom he received the sums, because this is not traversable, for it is a consideration executed, Trin. 14 Eliz. Ban. Regis, Beckingham & Lambert; for the Ac∣count is confessed by the promise to pay. Counts that upon an in simul computasset the Defendant was indebted to him in 20 l. and pro∣mised to pay it, &c. Crook Justice said it was a good consideration; and Doderidge said, that in every Action of debt an Action of the case is implied, and when it appears how the debt grew due, then it is a good Assumpsit, Trin. 14 Jac. Ban. Regis, Cul∣limore and Eynison. Against him that takes upon him to plant Thorns, and doth not do it,Planting. Lib. Intr. 13. C. sect. 1. for the planting may be for my benefit. Save harmless.1. My Servant being in prison, I request his enlargement, and promise to save A harmless, an Action lies if I do it not; but without request not, 10 Eliz. Dyer 272. pl. 31. 2. If one become Bail for the Servant, and after the Master promise to save him harmless, an Action
lies not; for here is no consideration continuing Quaere, if he continue his Servant. 3. A being Bail for B in Ban. Regis, B promise to save him harmless; yet A shall not have a Action against B although he pay the money, i no Capias be awarded against the Principal,  Scire facias against the Bail, Trin. 7 Jac. Ban. Regis. Bolles & Jones error upon Judgment in Com. Bu for here is no due proceedings in Law against ei∣ther. 4. A being indebted to B, prays C to be bound to B for the debt, and he will be bound to C, & C is bound to B, &c. A refuseth to be bound to C, C shall have an Action against A, for it is a goo consideration insomuch that C is liable to the d Mich. 9 Jac. Ban. Regis, Knyvet & Pledall, and it  reason A should secure him. 5. A promises to B to discharge him, and s him harmless from all bonds in which he w bound for the Son of A, at the request of the s Son B. brought his Action, and shews that he  fidei jussor was bound. 1. It is a good considera∣tion. 2. He ought to shew precisely that his S requested him to be bound, for although fidei ju imply a request, yet it is not sufficient, Pasch. 9 Jac. Ban. Regis, Somerston & Brnby, & postea Mich.  Jac. it is shewed that it was alledged, and for th judgment was given for the Plaintiff, Lib. Intr.  C. Sect. 1. 6. An Infant borrows money,Infant. B is bound  pay it, at full age the Infant promises to save his harmless, Action lies upon it; for although th Infant was not liable in Law, yet in Conscience  was, and this sufficeth to maintain an Action upo
the Case, which is an equitable Action; for the consideration is good, Trin. 29 Eliz. Ban. Regis ad∣judged. A Widow promiseth for following her Suits to pay 200 l. this is not good;Sollicitor. for it is maintenance per 2. Justices, but Dyer against them; because it did not appear that they were Suits in Law, 19. E∣liz. Dyer 356. and they may be Suits in equity, or at the Court. A promises 10 l. to B,Sufferance if he suffer C to enjoy the Land; there although C enjoy it not, yet if A agree and do not interrupt C the Action lies, Pasch. 15 Jac. Ban. Regis, Taylor & Wilks; for he hath performed the consideration on his part. A being a Copyholder makes B his Executor, and intends to surrender, to the intent that B should satisfie a debt to D; the Son of A promises A that if he do not surrender, but suffer the Land to descend, he will satisfie the debt, A dies, B shall have an Action against the Son; for it is a good consideration, Hill. 9 Jac. Ban. Regis, Gray versus Gray, yet continuing. Tabling & Lodging.A promises to pay to B, for his reasonable board for such a time as he shall be with him; B shews that he was with him ten months, and that 5 s. the month is reasonable, amounting in all to 50 s. this is good, Pasch. 30 Eliz. Ban. Begis, Floyd & Irish. A being sick in an Inne, B promises to pay as much as shall be due for all necessaries that the Inn-keeper shall provide for A; yet in the Action the Inn-keeper shall say generally in the Writ
and Count, that he did provide necessaries from such a day, until, &c. in all to the value of 20 l. forasmuch as the promise was general, the Writ and Count is good though it be not particular. 2. It is inconvenient and dangerous to shew all things that he did provide, &c. the same Law is for: Physician per Doderidge Justice. Pasch. 13 Jac. Ban. Regis, Crips. & Baynton; for he may not remem∣ber all particulars, and so may mistake. 1. For money upon the sale of any personal things,Vendor. 33 Hen. 8 br. Action upon the Case 105, 110. 2 Rich. 3.14. Com. 102. upon an indebitatus as∣sumpsit; for the Law creates a promise. For in every Contract there is an assumpsit im∣plied, Coke 4. part. 94. Slades case; the Count needs not shew, but saepius requifitus, Pasch. 28 Elis. Com. Ban. Q. 2. In an Action for money upon the sale of a thing, he needs not count that he was possest ut de bonis propriis, Trin. 7 Jac. Ban. Regis, Fitz Willi & Blackman. viz. before the sale; for the Law im∣plies they were his, else he would not have sold them. 3. Against a Purveyor or Servant that bought goods for his Master, and promises payment, Dyer 230. pl. 56. 12 Hen. 8.12. Q. if it lies not also against the Master. 4. Against him that promises to a Baker to pay so much as he shall deliver in Bread to B, 29 Hen. 8.25. for it may be intended he gave B the Bread. 5. Upon a promise to pay for Cloth bought, i B doth not, 12 Hen. 8.12. for there he becomes i the nature of a Surety for the payment for it.
6. A brought an action, and shews that he sold a Horse to B at such a day, year, and place, to be payed at a day to come, and the Defendant ad tunc & ibidem ratione praemissorum assumes to pay, if, &c. B did not; this is nought, for the Con∣tract, and the giving of day to B, ne fuit ad instan∣tiam of the Defendant; but the Contract was compleat before, Pasch. 28 Jac. Ban. Regis, Farmer & Field, without any relation to the Defendant and his promises ex post facto, and grounded upon no consideration. 7. A promises to pay to B such sums of money as B shall disburse of his own money for Cloth, to the use of A the Defendant, this is a good con∣sideration: for by the buying of the Cloth the property was in A forthwith, Trin. 9 Jac. Ban. Regis, Moore & Moore; for it was bought for him. 8. A sold to B two ways of Barley for as much as he sold to others, the Plaintiff in the Action ought to count, 1. For what price he sold to o∣thers; 2. he ought to give notice of this to B. So if A promise to B 20 l. if he marry C, yet B ought to give notice of the marriage; but a Tayler may have an Action for as much as he shall deserve, and is not bound to give notice what he shall deserve, because it is not incertain, Hill. 13 Jac. Ban. Regis, Hall & Heminge. Q. for he must demand a certain sum, and this is notice. 1.

For not doing a thing which ought to be done by Agreement touching the body. 1. Against a Barber that takes upon him to raze the Beard,Barber. and doth it with an unwholsom Razor, Lib. Intra. 2.

Against a Physician or Chirurgeon for not curing a malady, or not applying a medicine, 14 Hen. 6.18. 43 Edw. 3.33. 21 Hen. 6.55. 48 Edw. 3.6. pl. 11. Regist. orig. 105. B. 112. A. 3. For advising his patient to apply a certain medicine to cure him, and it did not, 19 Hen. 6.49. quaere. For commanding his Servant to apply a medi∣cine, and he doth it not, 11 Edw. 4.6. Q. 4. For applying a medicine that impairs the Mayheme, 11 Rich. Action upon the Case 37.11 Hen. 6.18. pl. 10. 21 Hen. 6.55. B. But note in all these cases he ought to take upon him the Cure absolutely, 19 Hen. 6.49. 48 Edw. 3.6. else the Action lies not. The Writ. The Writ ought to shew the place where he took upon him the Cure, 48 Edw. 3.36. for it is issuable. If A promise to cure me in London, and apply unwholsom medicines in Middlesex, the Action shall be in Middlesex, because there was the wrong, 11 Rich. 2. Action upon the Case 37, and where the wrong is there must the trial be.
For not doing of a thing which ought to be done by agreement of the parties touching Suits in Law.Assumpsit. Against a Clerk that promises to enroll a Deed,Clerk. and doth it not, 34 Hen. 6.4. Serjeant. Counsel∣lor.Against a Serjeant or Counsellor that promises to plead for me, and doth it not, 14 Hen. 6.18. if I retain him and give him his fee, else not. For not doing of a thing where a man is bound to do it in one manner, and he doth it in another. Plough my land.Against him that promises to plough my land, and doth it in unseasonable time, 14 Hen. 6.18. 3 Hen. 6.36. for the Law implies he must do it for my best advantage. Against an Attorney that takes an obligation in his own name,Attorney. when it should have been in mine, 20 Hen. 6.25. Q. if an Action of Deceit do not lie. Against a Carpenter that undertakes to build a house in such a form,Carpenter. and builds it in another, Nat. br. 145. G. 2. Hen. 4.9. 21 Hen. 7.41. 20 Hen. 6.35. Q. if he build it in a better form, and more for the benefit of the Owner, and to his own loss. Against him that hath a Crane, and spoils my Merchandize,Cranage. Lib. Intr. 3. C. sect. 1. this is mis∣feasance. Against a Farrier that takes upon him to cure my Horse,Farrier. and applies unwholsom Medicines, &c. 19 Hen. 6.49. whereby my Horse is made worse.
For pricking my Horse, 46 Edw. 3.2, 3.10. Nat: br. 94. D. 18 Edw. 3 6. pl. 11. for it is the duty of an Artificer to do his office well and truly; and this is implied in Law upon his undertaking to use his art. For misusing a License,License. 21 Edw. 4.76. quaere what. Against a Serjeant at Law that is retained to plead, and mispleads,Misplead∣er. 14 Hen. 6.18. for this is misfeasance, and to his Clients prejudice it may be, but if it be not tunc quaere. To misplead is to plead otherwise than he is instructed by his Cli∣ent. For negligent suffering of a thing to be done to the damage of another. A borrowed a Horse of me, which dies suddenly,Borrowed. an Action lies not, 40 Edw. 3.6. for the borrower was in no fault. But if the thing be used in other manner than it was lent to be used, and dies, an Action lies, Doct. & Stud. 29. for this is misusing of it, and contrary to the agreement. But if it be but in the same manner that it was lent, and dies, no Action lies, Doct. & Stud. 29. for it was lent to be used, though not misused. A borrowed a Horse, and a House fell upon him; there if the house fell upon him being fee∣ble, Action lies, otherwise not, Doct. & Stud. 128. for he might have foreseen the danger, and pre∣vented it. Burning a House.Against him that keeps not well his fire, by which my house is burned, being adjoyning, 2 Hen. 4.18. 8 Edw. 4.19. pl. 30. Choke; for we
must so use our own that we hurt not another. Although his own house be burned, 33 Hen. 6.1. Lib. Intr. 8. A. sect. 1. for his own harm is no recompence to his Neighbour. 3. It lies although his Servant do it: but not if a stranger do it of malice, 33 Hen. 6.1. 2 Hen. 4.18. Doct. & Stud. 137. for the Master must be answerable for the actions of his Servants in civil matters, though not in criminal. 4. If a Servant bring fire in the street and buro a house, his Master is not chargeable; for when the Servant is out of his house he is not under his government. 5. It lies not if it be burned suddenly, and the cause not known, 42 Assize 8.2 Hen. 4.18. for the Law delights in certainties, and doth things upon just and sure grounds, and not upon probabi∣lities and surmises. Barr. That it was not burnt in default of good cu∣stody of the fire of the Defendant, Lib. Intra. 8. A. sect. 1. But by 28 Hen. 6.7. this is but a negative preg∣nant; for he might have pleaded non culp. which the other plea doth but imply. That he guarded his fire well, absque hoc that he guarded it negligently, Lab. Intra. 8. B. sect. 2. for here is a direct affirmative, and a traversing of Plaintiffs declaration. Against a Baily of Cloth, that suffers it to be consumed with Moths.Baily. 27 Hen. 8.25.13 Hen. 7.1.18 Edw. 3.23. viz. by negligent keeping, which the Law implies he ought not to do.
Against a Baily of a horse that suffers him to perish, 12 Edw. 4.13.26 Hen. 8 br. Action upon the Case 103. Lib. Intr. 3. B. sect. 1. Regist. orig. 107. A. for the former reason. For losing a Release, 34 Hen. 6.4. for the Re∣leasee may be prejudiced thereby. So of a box, Lib. Intra. 9. A. sect. 1. Against him that suffers his Dog to bite my sheep,Dog. 28 Hen. 8. Dyer 25. pl. 102. & fol. 29. pl. 195. 28 Hen. 6.7. pl. 7. Lib. Intr. 616. B. sect. 1. Regist. orig. 110. B. But then the Master ought to know that he would bite them, ibidem; for then he might have prevented it, and so is punishable for not doing it. But sciens is not traversable; but may be given in evidence, Coke 44. part. 188. for if he did not know it he may plead Not guilty, and the Plaintiff must prove he knew it. If the owner of the Dog brings him to the Master of the sheep to do justice upon him, it lies not, 7 Edw. 3. bar 290. viz. upon the first notice or knowledge of it, otherwise not. The Plaintiff declares, that the Defendant was possessed of a Dog 8. Octobris 7 Jac. using to bite, &c. and that the Dog 12. October in the same year did bite his Lambs, &c. this is not good; for he ought to have shewn, that he continued his Dog at the time of the biting; for it shall not be pre∣sumed that he continued it without shewing it, Pasch. 9 Jac. Ban. Regis, Louder versus Sounds, 21 Edw. 4.22. 15 Eliz. Dyer 320. for the Law will not presume any one will do an unlawful act, ex∣cept it be proved.
4. For suffering his Dog to bite my Servant, Regist. orig. 111. A. per quod servitium amisit, else not, as it seems. 5. For hurting of an Ox, Regist. orig. 111. A. whereby he loseth his work, or is hindred in his fatting. 6. For hurting of a Horse after warning given, Regist. orig. 106. A. for the Master ought to have kept him up. 1. Against a Warden of the Fleet,Escape. that suffers one to escape that was taken upon a Capias ad computandum, 15 Edw. 4.19. Lib. Intra. 8. C. Sect. 1. for thereby the Plaintiff is put to more trouble and charge, and is delayed in his Suit. 2. Against a Sheriff, that suffers one to escape that was taken upon a Statute Merchant, Reg. orig. 98. B. Nat. br. 93. A. the Writ there, upon the same reason. Against an Inn-keeper,Innkeeper. that suffers the goods of his guests to be stole, Coke 4. part. 32. Calyes case, Nat. 94. B. Regist. orig. 104. A, 105. A. 22 Hen. 6.21. 42 Assize 17. for the Law of the Land binds him to keep them safe at his peril. 1. But note, 1. this ought to be a common Inne, and it shall be shewed in the Count, but not in the Writ, 11 Hen. 4.45. 22 Hen. 6.21. pl. 38. Coke 8. part. 32. Calyes case, Dyer 206. pl. 9.2 Hen. 4. Not in the Writ, because that is more short, & ren breviter enarrat; but the Count ought to express things more fully. 2. It ought to be a Traveller that lodges there, otherwise the Action lies not, Coke 8. part. 32. Calyes case; for the Law looks upon an Inn only
in respect of Travellers, for in respect of others it is no more than a private house. 4. He shall declare of nothing but what was within his Inn; for if he bid the Inn-keeper put his Horse to pasture, or put him to pasture of his own accord, unless the Inn-keeper request him to do it, it lies not, Coke 8. part. 32. A. Calyes case; for he is an Inn-keeper in respect of his House, and not of his Land. 4. He ought safely to keep the goods within his Inn at his peril, 42 Assize 17. for it is no ex∣cuse that he delivered the Key to the Guest, 42 Edw. 3.11. pl. 13. 11 Hen. 4.45. 22 Hen. 6.38. or that the Guest did not acquaint him with his goods, 42 Edw. 3.11. except the Guest will not trust the Inn-keeper, but will have the Key. Quaere. Or that he knew not the Felons, 22 Hen. 6.38. A; for he must keep them safe against all persons, except forein Enemies. But if the Companion or Servant, or any other that the Guest desires to lie with him, rob him, the Inn-keeper shall not be accountable, Coke 8. part. 33. A. Calyes case, 22 Hen. 6.38. B. 22 Hen. 6.22. A. for that was his own fault to admit of such Com∣pany. Or if he say his house is full, and the other says he will make a shift, and be robbed, 5 Mariae, Dyer 158. pl. 32. for in such case he is not properly his Guest, nor takes any charge of him or his goods. Or if he command him to put his goods in such a place, and he will not, but suffer them to lie in the open Court, 10 Eliz. Dyer 266. pl. 9. for if
he cannot be Master to order his house as he de∣sires, it is no reason he should be punished for the disorder committed in it. And although the Writ is but bona & catalla, yet Evidences and all other Deeds are included: the Writ in this case shall be general, but the Count special, Coke 8. part. 33. Calyes case. Deeds and Evidences are bona & catalla, though not valuable to any person but the owner of them. But an Inn-keeper shall not be accountable for wrong done to the person of his Guest, Coke 8. part. 33. A, & B. Calyes case; for this is a crimi∣nal matter, and hath no relation to him as an Inn-keeper. 1.Servant. Against a Shepherd, that suffers my sheep to be drowned, 2 Hen. 7.11. pl. 9. Coke 5 part. 13. B. Salops case. 12 Edw. 3.4.13. Dyer 121. pl. 17. B. Salops case. 12 Edw. 3.4.13. Dyer 121. pl. 17. by negligence. 2. Against a Ploughman that suffers my Corn to be spoiled, 7 Hen. 4.14. by negligence, or ig∣norance, as it seems. Q. For Deceit in bargains and agreements with Warranty.Deceit in Bargains. 1. The Warranty of a thing sold is the cause of an Action in case of vendition, as well as of cor∣ruption, 19 Hen. 6.9. 2. And the Warranty ought to be at the time of the sale, 15 Hen. 7.41, Nat. br. 98. L. and not afterwards, 6 Edw. 6. Dyer 75. pl. 28. else not good. 3. It ought to be by the owner of the thing, and not by a Stranger; and upon the sale by the owner, and not by a Servant, 11 Edw. 4.6.
for Warranty relates immediately to him that war∣rants. It is not material whether the price be paid or not, for debt lies for it, 9 Hen. 7.21. pl. 2. Against the Seller of a Horse that is sick,Horse. and is warranted sound, Nat. br. 94. C. 7 Rich. 2.42. Regist. orig. 108. A. Lib. Intr. 9. B. sect. 1. for this is deceit. Or a lame Horse warranting sound, 31 Hen. 6.11. Statham. A strained Horse it lies not, because the buyer hath the view, 13 Hen. 4.1. pl. 4. Hank ford. Q. if he warrant him sound. Against a Seller of Cloth,Cloth. that warrants it well sulled when it is raw, 11 Hen. 6.221. Against him that warrants it of such a length, and this upon sale and warranty of the Servant, it lies against the Master, 11 Edw. 4 6. for it lies not against the Servant, ibidem, for the Cloth was the Masters. Against him that sells grain,Grain. and warrants it to be good, Lib. Intra. 9. B. sect. 1. Regist. orig. 111. A. whereas it is musty or corrupted. Against him that warrants Herrings,Herring. Regist. orig. 96. A. in the number and the goodness. Against him that sells a Saphire instead of a Diamond,Saphire. Kitchin 174. Against a Seller of wood,Wood. and shews part, and warrants the rest to be good, 14 Hen. 6.22. pl. 66. Against a Seller of corrupt Wine with war∣ranty,Wine. Nat. br. 94. C. 9 Hen. 6.35. 7 Hen. 4.14. pl. 19. that it is sound and wholsom.
If the Servant sold it by covin of the Master, Action lies against the Master, 9 Hen. 6.53. pl. 37. for it is the Masters act. For deceits in Bargains and Agreements, without Warranty. Deceit in bargain.1. Against him that sells a Horse not sound, knowing him to be so without warranty, 20 Hen. 6.34. 13 Hen. 4.2. Kitchin 174. Q. for it seems it lies not; yet if it doth, it is because the Law hates deceit in Contracts, for it hinders Commerce, which is beneficial to the Commonwealth. For selling an Horse to another that was not his own,Horse. 42 Assize 8. Coke 4. part. 18. B. for this is fraud. For selling Cloth that is nought,Cloth. knowing it to be so without warranty, 21 Hen. 7.91. pl. 16. Crooke. Against him that promises to deliver good Gum,Gum. and doth not, Mich. 7 Jac. Ban. Regis, Weston & Deighton. Against him that sells Wine mixed with water,Wine. Nat. br. 88. F. for this is but part Wine, and so the buyer hath not what he paid for. For uttering Corrupt victual,Victual. knowing it to be so, 19 Hen. 6.53. 22 Hen. 7.91. pl. 16. Crooke. 11 Edw. 4.6. B. Brian & Neal. Against him that sells good Wax and delivers ill,Wax. 6 Edw. 6. Dyer 75. pl. 18. Q. whether in all these cases an Indictment at the Common Law will not lie: It seems it will.
Trover and Conversion. In Law. In Deed. 1. Delivery as to persons unknown, 33 Hen.Trover Quid & Quotuplex. 8. Br. Action upon the Case 109. Trover for a Hawk with bells reclaimed and sold, knowing it to be the Plaintiffs, 14 Eliz. Dyer 306. pl. 66. for he cannot recover it against the Vendee. Q. The Sale here makes the Conversion. Sold as to persons unknown, Lib. Intra. 5. A. Sect. 1. 2. Wasting the goods, 34 Hen. 8. br. Action upon the Case 103. for this a Conversion in Law. 3. Denial to re-deliver. A brought an Acti∣on for Plate and Jewels, and shews, that upon request the Defendant refused to de∣liver them, this is good evidence to a Jury; but to find it at large, viz. without a re∣quest, is not a sufficient Conversion to warrant the Action, Coke 10. part. 46. B. Oxfords case, Hill. 12 Jac. Ban. Regis, Isack & Clarke, per 3 Justices, 33 Hen. 6.27. for the Count is in usum suum proprium con∣vertit & disposuit; but a nude denial is not a Conversion, Q. viz. that he hath the goods.
But if it be for money out of a bag,Money. then it is a good Conversion, if he deny it, because it cannot be known, Pasch. 14 Eliz. in Le chequer, and so the Plaintiff cannot prove that it was his money which was denied. Note, if the Plaintiff have not property in the things, it lies not, 20 Hen. 7. B. pl. 18. Q. what property he must have. 1 Pasch.Note. 43 in Eliz. Bushopps case it was a doubt, if A takes goods to the use of B, and afterwards B agree to the taking; quaere, if such Action lies against B. quia A divests the property by the taking, and not B by the consenting, as it seems. 2. The count ought to shew the place of con∣version, Mich. 26, 27 Eliz. Ban. Regis, Stranhams case; because it is traversable and issuable. So the day of the Conversion, Hill. 7 Jac. Ban. Regis; for the same reason, and without shewing that the Defendant knows not how to plead in bar. If the count be of Trover, and the Jury find up∣on Bailment; yet good, for the Conversion is the point of action, Hill. 12 Jac. Ban. Regis, Isack & Clark, and not the Trover, for it is no fault to find a thing, for no property is gained by the bat finding, but by the Conversion. Of what things it lies. 1.Money. It lies for money out of a purse upon spe∣cial matter, that he lost it and the other found it, Trin. 43 Eliz. Com. Ban. Hall & Wood; Pasch. 24 Eliz. in the Exchequer; but not generally, for money cannot be known, and so the Plaintiff can fix no property in himself.
2. The Master delivers Corn to the Servant to fell, and brings his action for the money and goods; 1. the possession of the Servant is the possession of the Master. 2. It lies of money, Mich. 4, & 41 Eliz. Ban. Regis, Holliday & Higges; for the money comes in lieu of the Corn. It lies for 20 Sheep,Sheep. Coke 5. part. 109. Foxleys case. It lies for a Chain-door, sound and sold,Chain∣door. Horse. 3 Mariae, Dyer 121. pl. 14. It lies of a Horse. But it is no plea for the Defendant that a person unknown stole them, and left them, & waiviavit, without shewing the circumstances when and where, Coke 5. part. Foxleys case 109. A. but if he had said, quidam ignotus waiviavit them, with∣out saying any more, this is good; for the cir∣cumstances shall be intended; for waiviavit est vecabulum artis, and implies all, Mich. 15 Jac. Ban. Regis, Leader & Paschall. 1. To traverse the sale is a good plea, 3 Mariae Dyer 121. pl. 16. viz. to say, he did not sell them. 2. That he distrained them for a Rent charge absque hoc, that he converted them, this is nought; for it is no Conversion at all, ideoque it amounts but to the gneral issue, non culp. Mich. 9 Jac. Ban. Regis, Davies & Knap. That he is a Horse-breaker, and the Plaintiff delivered it for him, &c. Absque hoc, &c. this a∣mounts but to the general issue, non culp. Mich. 9 Jac. Ban. Regis, Lovelace & Martyn, and not good.
Husband and Wife shall have this Action for a Deed by which an Annuity was granted to the Wife;Deeds. for the Wife should have it, if she survive the Husband, Trin. 40 Eliz. Com. Ban. Russel & Catesby; and the Husband is to have it during his life, viz. to make use of upon occasion. It lies for twenty Pooks of Corn,Frument and Grain. Trin. 38. Eliz. Com. Ban. Price versus Sr. Walter Sands. It lies of four bushels of Wheat, Trin. 12 Jac. Ban. Regis, Hill & Hawkes. The Defendant shews a prescription in the Baily of L. to elect a Belman, which ought to repair the street of the Market-place, and to cleanse it, and that he shall have of every bushel there brought to sell, one pint of Wheat, &c. and justifies, &c. this is good, because the custome is doubtful and may be put in issue, therefore a good bar; otherwise this plea would amount un∣to the general issue; Trin. 12 Jac. Ban. Regis, Hill & Hawks, and then it would not be good. For delivering of Jewels, &c. in a Box to B, who dies,Jewels. and they come to C, who breaks the Box and converts them, 20 Hen. 7.4, pl. 13. That he did not convert them to his own use is a good bar; for the Trover and breaking of the Box are but conveyances to the Conversion, 20 Hen. 7.4. pl. 13. per Fineux, and not the ground of the Action. It lies of Quinquaginta pondus of Wool ad va∣lentiam,Wool. &c. for per Curiam pondus shall be taken one pound weight, because this weight is more certainly known throughout all the Countrey, Mich. 9 Jac. Ban. Regis, Roe & Lloyd; & loquen∣dum est ut vulgus.

In what Court Covenant lies, 1. Personal; 2. Real. 1. IT lies in the County or Hundred Court, Nat. br. 145. E. 2. It lies in any Court of the Lord of a Man∣nor, Nat. br. 145. E. 3. In London, Nat. br. 146. A. and other Cor∣porations. 1. Marshalsey between two of the Houshold of the King, Coke 10. part. 74. A. otherwise not. 2.

A Fine levied in the County Palatine of Lan∣caster, good, 37 Hen. 8. cap. 19. which is in nature of a Covenant. In Banco Regis, 36 Hen. 6.34. A. Forteseue, but it shall be avoided by Writ of Error. Q. except it be meant of a fine. In Ancient demesn, quaere per 6 Edw. 3.207. pl. 20. it seems it should lie. But 44 Edw. 3.37. 50 Assize 9. Knivet, it is not good. Q. But 22 Hen. 7.90. B. pl. 14.

In Communi Banco. Before the Justices of the grand Sessions in Wales, 34 Hen. 8. cap. 26.
Who shall have Covenant, 1. Personal; 2. Real. If a man Covenant with another to enfeoff him, or to serve him, &c. the other shall have co∣venant, although he do not agree, Nat. br. 145. A. But then it ought to be by deed, Regist. orig. 165. B. Nat. br. 145. A, & G. 7 Rich. 2. deeds 160. which is an estoppel to say the other did not a∣gree. Yet in London a man shall have covenant to levy a fine without deed per custome, Nat. br. 146. A. 22 Edw. 4.2. pl. 6. Vavisor. 21 Hen. 6.10. Co∣venant 11. Administrator shall have Covenant by the e∣quity of the Stat.Admini∣strator. de 31 Edw. 3. cap. 11. Coke 9. part. 40. A. Hensloes case, made for Executors. But not before, 19 Edw. 3. Covenant 24. Assignee shall have Covenant,Assignee. where it is made to one and his Assigns, Nat. br. 145. C. Regist. orig. 165. B. for the Assignee is in place of the As∣signor. Assignee shall have Covenant without shewing the deed of covenant,Assignee. for he may not have it, Trin. 36 Eliz. Banco Regis, Noke versus Ander. But there, if the Lessee for years by estoppel grant over his term, the Assignee shall not have Covenant, because the Assignor had nothing in the land, but only an estoppel against the Lessor not to out him. A, Prior with the assent of his Covent by deed, covenants for him and his successors with B and his heirs, that he and his Covent shall sing in the Chappel of B, which is parcel of the Man∣nor of B, for the Lords of the said Mannor.
The Assignee of B shall have covenant, because it is a service annexed to the Mannor, 42 Edw. 3.3. pl. 14. Coke 5. part. 17. B. Spencers case, 45 Edw. 3.3. 28 Hen. 8. Dyer 24. pl. 149. 2 Hen. 4.6. pl. 25. and who so hath the Mannor, or is in∣teressed in the Covenant. But if the service is to be made in the Chappel of another, then the Assignee shall not have co∣venant, because it is not annexed to the Mannor, 2 Hen. 46. pl. 25. And so if one covenant with a Tenant by the Courtesie to sing in his house, although that he surrender and take for years he shall have Cove∣nant, because it was annexed to his estate, 6 Hen. 4.1. pl. 5. viz. for life. Q. Assignee by word shall have covenant, Coke 3. part. 63. A. Lincoln Colledges case; for such an assignment is good. Assignee of Assignee shall have covenant, Coke 5. part. 71. B. and so in infinitum, as it seems, so long as the estate assigned continues, if the Cove∣nant go with the estate. Assignee of one Coparcener shall have covenant against the other coparcener to acquit him of the suit, because the covenant goes with the land, Coke 5. part. 18. A. Spencers case, 42 Edw. 3.3. Lessor covenants to repair the house lett, the Assignee shall have covenant against him, because this is annexed to the estate: so the husband of the wife that is a Termor, and a Tenant per Sta∣tute Merchant staple, and every one that comes to the land Coke 5. part. 17. Spencers case, to which the Covenant is annexed.
So in all cases where it is annexed to the estate, Nat. br. 146. C. 48 Edw. 3. and not to the person otherwise than in relation to the Land. Assignee of a reversion shall have covenant as well as the Lessor shall have it, per 32 Hen. 8. cap. 34. but this is when it concerns the things demi∣sed, and not collateral Covenants, Coke 5. part. 18. A. Spencers case; for in respect of Reversion of the thing lett, he comes in room of the Lessor in privity of estate. Assignee of a Reversion for years when, the Tenant for years hath a greater Term, his As∣signee shall have Covenant within, 32 Hen. 8. al∣though the Lessor grant over his Term, Trin. 40 Eliz. Ban. Regis, Rot. 123. Natures versus Westwood, quaere. Assignee shall have covenant, upon covenant in Law, Coke 4. part. 80. B. 9 Eliz. Dyer 257. pl. 13. where it goes with the estate. Lessee covenants with the Lessor and his heirs to repair the house, the Assignee of the Lessor shall have covenant, Mich. 9 Jac. Ban. Regis, Best∣wicke & Wilborne; for it goes with the house. Husband and Wise.Lease for years to the Husband and Wife, the Lessor outs them, they may joyn in covenant, because after the death of the husband she shall have a term, if he grant it not over, 47 Edw. 3.12. pl. 11. and so she hath a possibility of interest. The Commonalty of D Covenants with the Major and Commonalty of L,Corpora∣tion. that they shall be quit of Toll, &c. in D, and after one Burgess in D takes toll of one in L, Covenant lies for one Corporation against another, 48 Edw. 3.17. pl. 2. It may be brought by the Major and Commonalty
of one Corporation against the Major and Com∣monalty of the other Corporation. Executor shall have Covenant for Covenant made to his Testator for a personal thing,Executor. for the personal estate is his to the use of the Testators will, Nat. br. 145. D. and orig. Regist. 165. B. Note, de conventione pro executoribus non invenitur breve in Registr. sed pro assignatis, tamen potest fieri pro executoribus tam bene quam pro assignatis, nam ea∣dem est ratio de utrisque. A leases to B for life for 12 years, and B dies within the 12 years, the Executors of B shall have it until 12 years, &c. B dies, A outs the Ex∣ecutors within 12 years, they shall have Covenant, 19 Edw. 3. Covenant 24. Executor of an Ex∣ecutor.Executor of an Executor shall have Covenant by the Common Law, 19 Edw. 3. Covenant 24. pol. Com. 290. Chapmans case, Lib. Intr. 134. B. sect. 1. and so forwards, for the right dies not. The Heir shall have covenant,Heir. if the deed be made to him and his heirs, Nat. br. 145. C. 16 E∣liz. Dyer 338. pl. 39. but this was to enfeoff him and his heirs: so that this holds not generally, but where the heir is interessed in the Covenant. A enfeoffs B in see, rendring for 8 years one Rose, and afterwards 20 Roses, B dies, his heir within Age, the Lord recovers the Land by rea∣son of Collusion, the Heir at full age shall have covenant, 18 Edw. 3 Covenant 7. in respect of his privity to the Covenant. A covenants with B and C and their heirs,Joynt∣tenant. & eorum utri{que} to make an estate to the heir of him which first dies (being Parcener) the heir of one shall have covenant sole, 16 Eliz. Dyer 338. pl. viz. of him that first dies.
When any of the Covenantees shall have se∣veral interests or estates, and the covenant is made with them & cum quolibet eorum, they shall have several covenants, otherways not, Coke 5. part. 22. A. Matthewsons case, in respect of their several interests. Lessee for years by deed Poll is outed by the Lessor,Lessee. he shall have covenant, Nat. br. 145. L. 21 Edw. 4.30. pl. 25. for the lease implies a covenant to enjoy during the term. But if a stranger outs him without title he shall not have Covenant, Nat. br. 145. L. 22 Hen. 9.52. pl. 26. But if he had a colourable title and ousts him. quaere. Although it be by verdict, Coke 4. part. 80. B. Nokes case; for the verdict may not be according to Law. Q. And although the Lessor warrant to him du∣ring the term, 26 Hen. 8.3. pl. 11. for the war∣ranty is not so general: but if he warrant it a∣gainst all men. Q. But if a stranger that hath Title out him, then it lies, Nat. br. 145. 32 Hen. 6.32. pl. 27. Nedham; for that proves he had no power to lett. But Lessee for life shall not have Covenant up∣on such outing, for this cannot divests him of the Freehold, 26 Hen. 16. Covenant 10. Nat. br. 145. M. if in the covenant it be not exprest. But 13 Edw. 3. sines 165. per Shard, if a lease be to A without impeachment of waste, and waste be brought against him, A shall have Cove∣nant; for the lease implies a Covenant, that he shall not be sued for waste.
Tenant for life shall not have the benefit of warranty, if he be not in possession, 26 Hen. 8.3. pl. 11. viz. at the time of the warranty. Lessee for years shall have Covenant upon a demise and grant, Coke 4. part. 80. B. Nokes case, & 5. part. 17. A. that is, if the lease runs, that Lessor doth demise and grant. Q. If the land be evicted, Pasch. 7 Jac. Ban. Regis, Winchombe & Rigge. A lease made to A. per dedi & concessi, the land is evict for years, A shall have Covenant against the lessor, for judgment was so entered, Mich. 9 Jac. But Williams & Yel∣verton said, that it was without their privity; and Williams said, that it lied not: quaere ergo. Recusant shall not have an action of covenant for any thing seised into the Kings hands,Recusant. 1 Jac. cap. 5. by vertue of the Lessors recusancy; for the Common Law takes no notice of Recusan∣cy. Successor shall have covenant upon a covenant made and broken in the time of his predecessor,Successor. 4 Edw. 3.130. pl. 71. quaere what Successor, or whether any kind of Successor. A covenants to levy a fine,Fine. the party to whom this covenant is made shall have covenant, Nat. br. 146. F. Against whom Covenant lies, 1. Personal, 2. Real. Administrator is subject to it,Admini∣strator. 13 Edw. 3. cap. 11. Coke 9. part. 40. A. Hensloes case, upon a Cove∣nant made by the Intestate. Assignee of a Termor shall be liable without naming how the condition of the thing extendsAssignee.
to the things in esse parcel of the demise, Coke 5. part. 16. A. Spencers case, & fol. 24. Worcesters case. This extends to him that comes to the demise any way, Coke 5. part. 17. B. Spencers case; viz. any legal way: but quaere, if the Lessee be outed by one who hath no interest. So if the Covenant extends to a thing to be newly made, if it shall be made upon the demised land, the Assignee shall be bound by express Cove∣nant to the Lessor and his Assigns, Coke 5. part. 16. B. Spencers case, 25 Hen. 8. br. Covenant 32. Lessee co∣venants for him and his Assigns to repair a house, Covenant lies against the Lessee, and then against the Assignee also for the same breach, and no re∣medy but an Audita querela, per Brook. Q. A leases for years to B, and covenants to suffer him to enjoy; there the Assignee of A of the Re∣version is liable, though not named, 9 Eliz. Dyer 255. pl. 4. for he comes in interest of estate in the room of A, who covenanted. When the Covenant extends to a thing which had not essence at the time of the demise, the Assignee is not liable without naming him, Coke 5. part. 16. B. as where the Lessee Covenants to build a new house upon Land lett. Q. rationem. When the demise is of a personal thing the As∣signee is not liable by express name, Coke 5. part. 16.17. because the Covenant goes to the person and not the estate. If the demise be of Land and a personal thing the Assignee is not bound by express name for the personality, for there can be no privity between the Lessor and Assignee, Coke 5. part. 16, & 17. but for the realty he shall be bound.
The Statute of 32 Hen. 8. cap. 34. extends to Covenants, which touch the thing demised, and not to collateral Covenants which concern it not, for the Statute looks at the estate. It lies against Executors,Executors. Regist. orig. 165. B. Nat. br. 145. H. and this is although they be not na∣med, 28 Hen. 8. Dyer 14. pl. 69. 45 Edw. 3.17. pl. 4. 47 Edw. 3.22. 48 Edw. 3.2. pl. 4. 9 Eliz. Dyer 255. pl. 4. for they represent the person of the Testator, and come in his stead. But all the Executors ought to be named, 47 Edw. 3.22. pl. 20. in the Writ and Declaration. A Lease is made to A, the Lessor covenants to pay the quit Rents, &c. divers dues likewise; this is a personal thing, and binds not the Executor, 2 & 3 Mariae 114. pl. 6. of the Lessor. Q. for it is paid ratione terrae. A Lease is made to the Husband and Wife,Feme. the Husband covenants to make assurance for the Rent, this binds not the wife, because it is col∣lateral, 45 Edw. 3.11. pl. 7. for the Lessor hath remedy for the Rent without such assurance. But if they covenant, that they will not assign without his consent; there the Wife is bound, if the husband die, 18 Hen. 8. Dyer 13. pl. 66. Shel∣sey; for else the Lessee is without remedy. Heir shall be bound by covenant of his Ancestor,Heir. if be named, Regist. orig. 165. B. else not. And although it be broken by his Ancestor, 4 Edw. 3.130. pl. 71. as well as if broken by himself. But not if he be not named, 28 Hen. 8. Dyer 14. pl. 69. 32 Hen. 6.32. p. 27. for then the Law will intend only, that the Executor or Administrator shall be bound.
Infant cannot be bound by his Covenant to be an Apprentice per the Common Law,Infant. but by Cu∣stome of London he may, 21 Edw. 4.6. pl. 17. But then he shall be of the age of 14 years, 21 Hen. 6.31. which are accounted years of dis∣cretion, to distinguish what may be for his benefit, and what not. But an Infant of 12 years shall be bound by his Covenant to serve in husbandry, Nat. br. 168. D. 7 Hen. 4.5. pl. 29. 9 Hen. 6.10. pl. 28. 21 Hen. 6.31. Newton. for husbandry is for the good of the Commonwealth, and the knowledge and maintenance of it are much favoured in Law. But if he be within 12 years, he shall not be bound, 2 Hen. 4.18. pl. 7. 29 Edw. 3.27. pl. 29. 41 Edw. 3.17. pl. 1. for under those years he is indeed incapable of learning the Art, by reason of disability of body and understanding also. Lessee covenants to leave the house in good case,Lessee. it lies not against him till the end of the Term, Nat. br. 145. K. 12 Edw. 2. Covenant 2. But if he covenant sustentare & reparare, it lies presently, 45 Eliz. Dyer 324. pl. 34. and when∣soever it shall be out of repair, during the term. So if he covenants to leave the Timber in good plight, this is void for the impossibility, Coke 5. part. 21. A. Mains case, 7 part. 15. A. Englefields case, Fitzberbert covenant 29. Nemo tenetur ad impossibile. For if the Trees are thrown down by Tempest, it lies not, 40 Edw. 3.6. A. Coke 1. part. 98. A. Shelleys case; for this could not be prevented. But if the house be wasted by Enemies or Tem∣pest, he ought to repair by reason of the Covenant,
or build it, 40 Edw. 3.6. A. Moris. Doct. & Stud. 66. B. 29 Hen. 8. Dyer 33. pl. 10. if there be an express Covenant to do it. Lessor is bound by express Covenant or Cove∣nants in Law.Lessor. It lies against a Lessor, if he outs his Termor, Nat. br. 145. L. 21 Edw. 4.30. pl. 25. Coke 9. part. 80. A. 32 Hen. 6.32. pl. 27. without cause, and during the term. A Parson leases his Glebe,Parson. and resigns during the term, covenant lies against him, because it is his own act and wrong, 12 Hen. 4.3. and the Suc∣cessor may avoid the Lease. Where a Parcener upon partition covenants to sue a Writ of Partition,Parcener: the other assigns his estate to B, which covenants against the Covenanter and good, Coke 5. part. 17. B. 42 Edw. 3.3. If one become pledge for another to perform such a Covenant, the Action lies against the pledge,Pledge. Nat. br. 146. B. for he is in the place of the Prin∣cipal. But then he ought to charge him as principal, 39 Edw. 3.9. pl. 14. Or shew that the Principal is not sufficient, 40 Edw. 3.5. Covenant 16. It lies against a Successor,Successor. Lib. Intra. 136. B. Sect. 2. quaere what, or whether against all. It lies against him that should make a Deed,Deed. Nat. br. 146. F. that covenants to do it, and does it not.
For what things Covenant lies, 1. Personal; 2. Real. Guardian in Soc∣cage.Guardian in Soccage grants the custody of the Ward to A, who covenants to render an Accou to the Heir at full age, Covenant lieth for not do∣ing of it, Regist. orig. 165. B. Nat. br. 145. H. so the Guardian. Q. whether an Account lies no for the heir. Covenant lies against him that doth not accord∣ing to his Covenant by deed, Nat. br. 145. A. th is, doth not perform the whole covenant. But if it be not by deed, it lies not, Regist. orig. 165. B. Nat. br. 145. A & G. 7 Rich. 2. deeds 16. Nat br. 168. F. 14 Hen. 4.26. but an Action up the Case upon the Assumpsit. Unless it be in London by Custome, Nat. br. 146. A. 22 Edw. 4.2. pl. 6. Vavisor, 27 Hen. 6.10. C∣venant 11. Doctor Hector had a Patent,Patent. that none sho bring over Spanish Wool but himself, &c. he by his Indenture grants this to another, which by the same Indenture covenants to pay yearly 100 l with this Proviso, that if he pay it not the I∣denture to be void; yet covenant lies for the money that was due before the avoiding of the I∣denture, Mich. 9 Eliz. Ban. Regis, Dr. Hectors ca. A gives a Mill to B,Mill. &c. and that with a Pro∣viso, quod nec ego, nec haeredes mei constru molendinum, in, &c. Covenant lies again the Heir, if he or his Father erect a Mill there,  Edw. 3.130. pl. 71. for the Heir is bound by his Fa∣thers covenant. A Termor deviseth the term by will to his wifTermo
during her Widowhood, the remainder to C, and dies, the Lessor sells the Fee to the wise, and co∣venants that he would discharge all former Titles, &c. she marries C in the mean time, Covenant lies against the Bargainor by the Baron and Feme, if C do oust them during the term; for it was his own folly to make such a Sale and Covenant. Coke 10. part. 51. Lampets case. A leases to B for years, if C lives so long,Lease. and covenants that he had power to do it, C being dead at the time, Covenant lies, if A had not a good estate in it, Coke 9. part. 60. Bradshaws case, though C was dead; for if he had no good estate, he had no power to lett, and so his Covenant im∣plied in Law is broken. A leases to B for years Lands in which C had a Copyhold estate, and covenants that the Lessor shall suffer him quietly to hold the same, without trouble either of the Lessor or any other. B enters, C outs him, Covenant lies not, because all the se∣quel depends upon this word [suffer,] the which extends only to the Lessor, and his Executors and Assigns, 9 Eliz. Dyer 255. pl. 4. and not to the Copy∣holder, who hath a distinct interest from the Lessor. A leases to B for years, and covenants, quod pa∣cifice gauderet, &c. sine interruptione alicujus, Co∣venant lies, if any interrupt him, 16 Eliz. Dyer 328. pl. 8. for the word alicujus is a general word, and includes all persons. Lessor covenants, that the Lessee shall quietly and peaceably have, &c. without the disturbance or hindrance of the Lessor, the Lessor sues the Lessee in Chancery, and supposes that the Lease was only made to try a Title, an Action of
Covenant lies not for such breach, Trin. 11 Jac. Com. Ban. Rot. 384. Selby versus Shute; for this was but a Lease in trust only for the benefit of the Lessor, and not of the Lessee. Lessee by deed Poll shall have a Covenant a∣gainst the Lessor,Lessee. if he out him, Nat. br. 145. l. 35 Hen. 8. Dyer 57. pl. 24. Shelley. for the Action ariseth upon the covenant of the Lessor, which may be by deed Poll. But not upon outing by a stranger without Ti∣tle, Nat. br. 145. L. 22 Hen. 6.52. pl. 26. Hill. 12 Jac. Com. Ban. Tisdale & Essex; yet quaere, if he had a colourable Title. Although it be by Recovery, by Verdict, Coke 4. part. 80. B. Nokes case. vid. antea. But if a Stranger hath Title, then it lies, Nat. br. 145. L. 32 Hen. 6.32. pl. 27. Nedham; for the the Lessor could not lett. But Tenant for life shall not have Covenant for such ousting, Nat. br. 145. M. 26 Hen. 6. Covenant so. for ousting is intended of a term, and not of a Freehold, for such ousting is a disseisin. If it be not exprest, Nat. br. 145. M. for that declares what ousting was meant by the par∣ties. Lessee for years shall have Covenant upon a demise and grant, Coke 4. part. 80. B. Nokes case 5. part. A. Spencers case; viz. upon the words de∣mise and grant in the Lease, for they imply a Covenant. Lease for years with warranty, the Lessee outed shall have Covenant, 26 Hen. 8.3. pl. 13. by all 9 Eliz. Dyer 257. pl. 13. for the warranty im∣plieth a Covenant for quiet enjoying.
Tenant for anothers life leases for years with warranty, he for whose life the Lease was dies, the first Lessor enters, Covenant lies, 32 Hen. 6.32. pl. 27.9 Eliz. Dyer 257. pl. 13. against the Lessee for life upon his warranty, because his estate was but a contingent estate, and the warranty supposed t absolute. But if it be without warranty it lies not, 9 E∣liz. Dyer 257. pl. 13. for he letts no greater estate than he hath. A Covenants to serve B for years, and dies, no Action lies, quia mors omnia solvit, 48 Edw. 3.2. B. pl. 4. Finchden. Hill. 33 Eliz. Ban. Regis, Wilson & Mapes. A Parson leases his Rectory, and covenants to save harmless the Lessee, concerning the lands and pro∣fits for one year against Blunt, Blunt enters within the year; Covenant lies, because it is expressed against a certain person. Quaere, if it had been generally. Lessee covenants, that he will not assign his Term over, by which it may come to D; the Lessee assigns it to K per Curiam, Covenant lies, for he hath put the power out of him, Trin. 13 Jac. Com. Ban. Guines case, and it may come to D whether he will or no. Of a Fine levied of Rent, a Writ of Covenant lies, 22 Edw. 4.2. pl. 6. The Count in Covenant, 1. Personal; 2. Real. The Count was, that per Indenturam suam testat. existit, that the Defendant covenanted so and so, this is good; but such plea in bar is not good,
Mich. 7 Jac. Ban. Regis, Wyrdnam versus Fankner, 2 Mariae 117. pl. 78. but he must plead Covenants performed, and tender an issue. Prior and Covent leases to two for years with warranty,Count. per Indenture, rendring Rent; one dies after possession, the other survives, and was sole possest, the Prior dies, the Defendant fuit elect & praefectus Prior, & tali die expulsus & ejectus est, the Survivor by the new Prior, and so the Defen∣dant did not hold Covenant made between the late Prior and the said Survivor, Lib. Intr. 135. D. sect. 2. this is a good Count, for the Covenant lies by the Survivor against the Successor. Count upon covenants to make a new Lease, Com. 2. Chapmans case, and good. A leases to B for 6 years, if C live so long, and covenants that he had power to demise it, &c. B in covenant needs not count that C was in life, for if he were dead at the time of the demise, yet Covenant lies; 2. he need not shew that he had the better right, because he did pursue the words of the Covenant negative, Coke 9. part. 60. Brad∣shawes case, or else it cannot appear it is the Co∣venant upon which the Action is brought. Count by the Lessor against the Lessee, that Co∣venants to pay all charges, and pays not the tenths granted per Parliament, Lib. Intr. 136. C. sect. 4. for the word Charges includes the Tenths, for they are charges issuing out of the Land, or pay∣able ratione terrae. The Count shall be general, that he hath broken covenants between them, to the dammage, &c. the other shall say, that they are performed,
the Plaintiff may reply, that they are not, because he shall have several dammages for every Cove∣nant broken; but upon an Obligation he ought to shew in what he hath made a breach, because he shall have the forfeiture for one breach, 6 Hen. 4.8. pl. 34. if but one breach. Tenant for life leases for years rendring Rent, the Lessee covenants and is expulsed by him in remainder, 1. he ought to count that he was possess'd; 2. he ought to shew the estate for life, and the remainder certain, 9 Eliz. Dyer 257. pl. 13. because it is a special ouster, and not by the Lessor; and for the first, if he were not in possession, he cannot be said to be ousted. Writ in Covenant, 1. Personal; 2. Real. Rex,In Comitat. &c. justicies A. quod. teneat B. conven∣tionem inter eos factam, de quibusdam defectibus, in Manerio ipsius B. de N. existentibus sumptibus ipsius A. competenter emendand. sicut, &c. ne am∣plius, &c. Regist. orig. 167. A. This is in the Coun∣ty Court, as it seems. Rex,In Banco. &c. praecipe A. de B. quod juste, &c. tene∣at W. conventionem, inter eos factam de viginti acris terrae in K. frumento & alio blado competenti seminandis, & de bladis & terris praedict. crescen∣tibus metend. & ad domus ipsius W. sumptibus ejusdem A. in eadem villa cariandis, & nisi fecerit, &c. Regist. orig. 166. A. This in the Common Pleas.
The Writ shall be brought where the Covenant was made, Nat. br. 146. E. 11 Rich. 2. viz. in that County where it is a real Covenant. But it is no plea to abate the Writ unless the Deed bears date in another County, Nat. br. 146. E. than where the Covenant is brought, and it may be a Covenant by parol. The Writ for outing the Lessee shall be de dampuis & de perditis occasione expulsionis, &c. 9 Eliz. Dyer 257. pl. 13. for if he be not damnified no Action lies. The Writ ought to mention all the Executors which did administer, 47 Edw. 3.22. pl. 20.48 Edw. 3.2. pl. 4. where an Action of Covenant is brought against Executors; for all the Executors are but one Executor in Law, for they have a joynt trust and interest. The Process in Covenant, 1. Before appearance; 2. After. Covenant Personal.1. By the Common Law the Process before appearance was but a distress infinite, 22 Hen. 6.13. Br. exigend. 29. 48 Edw. 3.29. pl. 15. and no Capias. 2. After appearance the parties appear, and day is given over; (salvis partibus, &c.) the Defen∣dant makes default at the day, a distress was a∣warded against him, Lib. Intra. 134. B. Sect. 1. and not a Capias. Quia non fit breve de Attachiamento,Covenant Real. quia opor∣teat quod partes compareant personaliter in Curia, Regist. orig. 165. A. and here was day given over salvis partibus, which was no personal appearance.
The Bar in Covenant, 1. Personal; 2. Real. 1. When a certain duty accrues by the Cove∣nant at the time of the making of it,Accord. an Accord with satisfaction is no plea, Coke 6. part. 44. A. Blakes case; for such an Accord cannot discharge the duty. But a release may be pleaded in bar. But where no certain duty accrues until the subsequent act or wrong, there Accord with sa∣tisfaction is a good plea, Coke 6. part. 44. A. Blakes case; for he may make satisfaction for the wrong by the agreement of the Covenantee. Covenant to a Parson for the enjoying his Benefice, and the Parson deserts, the Cure is void, if he deny it after such desertion, 14 Eliz. cap. 11. Rastall, Leases 244. D. 23 Eliz. Dyer 372. pl. 11. This is after the Parson is absent forty days in the year, and not otherwise; for that is a desertion in Law whereby he may be deprived. A covenants to gather the Rents in D,Distur∣bance. and he pleads, that he was interrupted by the Plaintiff, and so could not do it; this is a good bar, Crooke 13. Hen. 7.34. pl. 2. for the Plaintiff shall not take advantage of his own wrong. Lessee covenants to surrender before the term ends, and a Stranger that hath right enters upon the Lessee, this is a discharge, because the Lessee is disabled by an act in Law, Hill. 41 Eliz. Com. Ban. Andrews versus Nedham, 45 Edw. 3.48. Performance generally a good plea,Perform∣ance. 6 Hen. 4.8. pl. 34. In a Covenant upon a demise by Indenture and an eviction by a Stranger, by a higher Title, it is
no Bar to traverse the possession of the Plaintiff without particular causes shewing how the other had title, because it is by Indenture, Trin. 3 Jac. Ban. Regis, Stile versus Hearing, which is a ge∣neral estoppel without shewing of special matter to avoid it. A covenants to make a good estate in Copy∣hold land to B before Easter, during the life of Cox; it is no plea to say, that it was surrendred to the Lord by his procurement to the use of C, if he shews not that he was admitted; for no∣thing vests in him to whose use it is till admit∣tance, Mich. 15 Jac. Ban. Regis, Stiles versus Smith, and so the Lord was not disabled to per∣form the Covenant. Release is no Bar before the Covenant is bro∣ken,Release. viz. generally, Coke 4. part. 71. Hors case, 5 Eliz. Dyer 217. pl. 2. Coke 1. part. 99. A. Shelley case. If it be not by express words, Coke 5. part. 71. A. 35 Hen. 8. Dyer 57. pl. 24. Bramly; for so the Covenant may be released. Judgment in Covenant, 1. Personal; 2. Real. Judgment against an Executor for a Covenant broken after the death of the Testator, is of the Testators goods, 15 Eliz. Dyer 324. pl. 34. for he is in the Testators stead, and trusted with his estate. If a Lessee recovers being outed by the Lessor, he shall recover his term, viz. the remainder un∣expired, Nat. br. 145. M. 47 Edw. 3.24. pl. 61. 20 Edw. 3. Judgment 177. and also Dammages, Nat. br. 145. M.
Execution in Covenant, 1. Personal; 2. Real. 1. Per Common Law; 2. Per Statute Law. By the Common Law it is but a Levari facias,Personal. Lib. Intra. 133. D. sect. 2. & fieri facias, Lib. Intra. 138. A. sect. 1. extending but to goods and Chattels. But no other Execution, Coke 3. part. 12. A. Harberts case. And this only within the year; for if the year be past it was an Action of debt upon the Judg∣ment, Coke 3.12. A. Unless the Process were continued, 33 Hen. 6.49. pl. 33. for the continuance of it made it, as if no time were passed, but continued a present Judg∣ment. By the Stat. by Westm. 2. cap. 45. a Scire facias was given after the year, Coke 3. part. 12. A. to revive the Judgment, and so the party is not now forced to bring an Action of debt upon it. And per Westm. 2. cap. 18. Elegit is given, Coke 3. part. 12. A. which extends to lands as well as goods. By the Stat. of 23 Hen. 8. cap. 14. Capias ad exigend fuit given in Process, and by consequence a Cap. ad satisfaciond. in execution against the person. By the Common Law it was but a Writ de fine facto;2. Real. or to pay a fine, as it seems, which was but a Writ of Covenant in its nature, 43 Edw. 3.12. B. Belknap. Glanvil. lib. 8. cap. 4. vide the Writ there. But entry was congeable to execute it, 8 Edw. 3.277. 24 Edw. 3.40. pl. 49. Coke 7. part. 32. and to hold till satisfaction made, as it seems. If Land be tailed to one by fine,Fine. he shall have a Formedon in Remainder, 6 Edw. 3.185. pl. 9. Herle to execute the Fine.
But when the King levies a find, he ought to make Letters Patents to the Conusee to enter, Coke 7. part. 32. for the King passeth nothing but by Record. A Fine levied of an Advowson, this may be executed by a Quare Impedit, 24 Edw. 3.69. pl. 78. But if an usurpation be, no Scire facias lies, 33 Edw. 3. Quare Impedit 193. Knivet, against the Usurper. Fine levied of Services, there shall be a per que servitio, 29 Edw. 3.46. pl. 9. to execute the Fine. If a Fine be levied of Rent, there may be  Writ of Covenant, 22 Edw. 4.2. pl. 6. to execute the Fine. Tenant grants to do his services, there shall be but a Distress, 10 Edw. 3.371. pl. 3. for that is the proper remedy to recover them, and there needed no Covenant. Tamen quaere. Fine levied of a Reversion, there shall be a quid juris clamat to execute this. And if the Tenant alien, yet the Writ shall be against him, and his Assignee shall be bound by his Attornment, 8 Hen. 6.17. B. 18 Hen. 6.3. B. pl. 2. by the Judgment given against the Assignor and himself. Conusor of a Fine dies, there shall be no quid juris clamat against him that claims; but if the Conusee only die, quaere if his Heir shall have the Writ, 34 Hen. 6.7. B. Moyle, against the party that hath the particular estate.
Fine levied before memory, there shall be no Execution, 1 Edw. 4.6. pl. 13. for it shall be in∣tended there was Execution formerly, or that there was to be none. By Westm. 2. cap. 44. Scire facias is given after the year to revive the Fine, which is a Judgment in Law; but within the year such Execution as in other Judgments.

In what Court Detinue lies, 1. of Chattels; 2. of Deeds for Land. In Comi∣tatu.1. IT lies in the County Court Nat. br. 138. B. In any other Court, Nat. br. 138. C. In the Common Bank, Nat. br. 138. B. It lies not in the Marshalsey, Coke 10. part. 76. A. 72. A. Marshalsey, Q. if both parties be of the Kings houshold, if it lie not. 2. In the County Court, Nat. br. 138. B. Regist. orig. 159. B. It lies not in any Court without a Writ, and if it be sued so a Prohibition lies, Nat. br. 138. C. Regist. orig. 159. B. viz. upon a plaint as is used in inferiour Courts. Who shall have a Detinue, 1. of Chattels; 2. of Deeds. An Avowant shall have a Detinue against a Sheriff upon a return. Habend.Avowant. where he returns quod Averia elongata sunt, per Westm. 2. cap. 2.9 Hen. 6.42. where they are not eloigned. Q. But this shall not be until it be returned quod plegii nihil habent nec sunt inventi; for the pledges are liable to answer the distress, if the principle doth not prosecute or eloign. Goods taken out of the possession of the wife,Husband. a Feme sole, which marries and dies, the Husband shall not have a Detinue, unless his wife make him Executor, 38 Hen. 6 26. pl. 38. for the Husband gained no property by the marriage, because the wife was out of possession at the time. Executor shall have a Detinue for the goods of the Testator.Executor.
A Woman shall have a detinue after divo for the goods given in marriage with her,Woman. Nat.  139. M. 16 Hen. 8.7. pl. 1. 28 Hen. 8. Dyer  pl. 61. for the divorce devests the property out  the husband, which he only had by virtue of  Marriage. But the 13 Hen. 3. Prohibition 21. the wife  sue for them in Court Christian. Q. A Woman shall have a Detinue for a rati bile parte bonorum, where the Custome gives  part, Nat. br. 122. L. for such Custome doth ve property in her. The Heir shall have a Detinue upon Bailm to rebayl to him,Heir. viz. the Ancestor, and his Hel▪ although it be but a Chattel, 15 Edw. 3.159. pl. 2 for the Heir is privy in Law to the bailment, and  interessed in the property. Custome that the Heir shall have the princip goods of his Ancestor, he shall have a Detinue for them, 30 Edw. 3.2. pl. 9. 39 Edw. 3.6. pl. 24. gainst the Executor. And so the Heir of a Copyholder shall have▪ Detinue for the Copy before his admittance, C 4. part. 22. B. 3. for he is intituled from his A∣cestor. A leases a house with implements to B  years,Lessor. A shall have a Detinue for the implement at the end of the term, although they are wasled, 20 Hen. 6.16. pl. 2. for by the Lease the propery was not altered. The Plaintiff in a Replegiare shall not have Detinue for Cattel taken in Withernam,Proprietor 6 He. 7.8. B. 2 Hen. 4.9. Br. Debt. 51. for by the Wi∣thernam he is devested of the property.
Because he that brings a Detinue ought to have property, 6 Hen. 7.9. Nat. br. 138. 2 Hen. 4.9. which here he hath not. In a Repleg. the Avowant hath return irre∣plevisable; yet if the Plaintiff tender amends, he shall have a Detinue, Coke 8. part. 147. A. for it was but conditional, as the Law implies. or he which returns Irreplevisable had not property in them, 10 Eliz. Dyer 280. pl. 14. but only to keep them till amends made. Quaere, if the Avowant after appearance claims property, he shall have a Detinue for the goods taken in Withernam, 11 Hen. 4.10. pl. 21. If a Horse be stole and sold in a Market overt, and be not tolled according to the Statute, 2 & 3 Mariae, cap. 7. the Owner hall have Detinue by the same Statute; for by such sale the property is not altered, for it is no sale in Law, because the Statute is not pursued. In Wales, if Cattel or goods be stole and sold in a Fair or Market, there the property is not altered, although tolled, therefore the Owner shall have a Detinue, 34 Hen. 8. cap. 26. Nota & quaere ra∣tionem. The King shall have Detinue for Cattel of an Outlawed person, 4 Hen. 7.17. pl. 3. bre.King. Outlawry 41. against him that distrains them; for the pro∣perty is vested in the King by the Outlawry be∣fore seisure. The Lord shall have a Detinue for a Heriot custome, if it be taken before seisure,Lord. because he had the property before seisure, 13 Edw. 3. Br. Hariot, Trin. 9 Jac. Ban. Regis Cresses case, per Cu∣riam in a Prohibition, vide 10 Hen. 4. 4 Hen. 6.
But the 14 Edw. 3. Bar 277. (Wilby) a than shall not have an Action for a Harriot. Qerg, not a Detinue. If a thing be delivered to A to deliver to B,Use. yet B shall have a Detinue, 18 Hen. 6.9. A. New∣ton; for the property is adjudged in B, because it was delivered to A for his benefit only. Husband and wife may joyn in Detinue for a deed of Lands,Husband and wife. 38 Hen. 6.25. Lib. Intr. 209. D. sect. 3. & fol. 217. A. sect. 2. viz. concerning Lands of the wife. But this is when the Defendant comes not to the Deed by bailment, for if the Husband bail them he shall have it alone, ibidem. 8 Edw. 4.15. 38 Hen. 6.25. A. for the privity lies betwixt the Bailor and the Bailee. Vide tamen, Lib. Intra. 217. A. sect. 2. If Bailment be before coverture they ought to joyn, 21 Hen. 7.29. for conformity: But upon bailment during the Coverture the Husband sole shall have a Detinue, 8 Edw. 4.16. for that is ad∣judged his bailment only. The Donor in tail shall have a Detinue for the Indenture after the death of the Donce withou Issue,Donor. Nat. br. 138. F. in respect of his reversio which depends upon the deed. An Estranger shall not have a Detinue for deed unless he makes title to the Land,Estranger. but upon re∣quest to deliver them, and a refusal, he shall hav an Action upon the Case, 33 Hen. 6.26. pl. 1 Prisot, if the Deeds do concern him. If one have Deeds and some concern warrant some not,Feosee. and enfeoff B with warranty, B sha not have a Detinue for the deeds, which serv
to deraigne the warranty per amount, Coke 1. part. 2. Buckhursts case, 44 Edw. 3.11. B. because they do not wholly concern him. Neither is it material for to maintain the title, Coke 1. part. 1. Buckhursts case. But they shall have them which concern the possession only, ibidem. viz. of the Land; and the Feoffor is to have the Deeds to maintain his warranty. But if a Feoffment be made without warranty the Feoffee shall have a Detinue for all, Coke 1: part. 1. Buckhursts case; viz. all the Deeds that do any ways concern the title, that he may be able to defend it. Unless it be per dedi, then it is express warranty during the life of the Feoffor, per statutum de Bi∣gamis, cap. 6. Coke 1. part. Buckhursts case 1. for the word Deed implies so much. But note, that in all these Cases the Feoffee shall have Detinue for them against a Stranger, that cannot intitle himself by the Feoffor, Nat. br. 138. G. Coke 1. part. 2. A. 7 Edw. 4.26. because a Stranger cannot pretend any colour. And note, if the thing which lies in grant, as a Lordship, Rent, Advowson, &c. be granted to A with warranty, which grants it to B with war∣ranty, B shall have a Detinue for the Ancient deed; because he cannot make a title without the Ancient deed, Coke 1. part. 1. B. Buckhursts case. quaere. So in all other Cases the Feoffee shall have a Detinue for every deed which concerns the ma∣king of his estate good, Nat. br. 138. K. for the Law favours Titles to Land, and loves the main∣tenance of them.
Note,Note. if A bail deeds of Land to B to re-bail them to him and his Heirs, and afterwards enfeoff C in fee; yet C shall not have a Detinue against B, for it is a charge to A, per cause of Bailment, Crooke 18 Hen. 7.48. pl. 3. If one enfeoff another with warranty, the Feoffor shall have the ancient deeds,Feoffor. which con∣tain the warranty, or which are material for the maintenance of the Title, Coke 1. part. 1. B. Buck∣hursts case. If A grant a thing that lies in grant to B with warranty, B shall have a Detinue for the Ancient deed, because this makes his title, Coke 1. part. 1. B. A enfeoffs B per dedi, A shall have the Anci∣ent deed, which comprehends the warranty, be∣cause dedi makes an express warranty, Coke 1. part. 2. B. and therefore it is good reason he should have the deed to make out the warranty by. A makes a deed of Feoffment, and delivers this upon condition, if the Condition be not per∣formed he shall have a Detinue, 37 Hen. 6.37. B. for the deed for the property was not absolute out of him. Heir ge∣neral.The Heir general shall have the Ancient deeds comprehending warranty, or necessary for the maintenance of the title, where the Feoffor ob∣liges him and his heirs to warranty; for he is bound by his Fathers act, and its reason he should have the deed to maintain it, Coke part. 1. B. Buck∣hursts case, Nat. br. 138. L. Feoffment per dedi the heir of the Feoffee shall not have the Ancient deeds, because he is not bound to warranty, Coke 1. part. 2. B. Buckhursts case; but the heir of the Feoffor. Q.
The heir of the disseisee shall have a Detinue for the deeds, Nat. br. 138. L. for he is in by de∣ceit, and the Law will judge his title good till it be evicted. Heir spe∣cial.The Heir in tail shall have a Detinue against the Discontinuee for the deed of entail, Nat. br. 138. H. 9 Edw. 4.52. pl. 15. for it belongs to him to make out his Title by virtue of the entail. And although there be a warranty to the Fe∣offee by his Father, 9 Hen. 6.15. pl. 5. 4 Hen. 7.10. pl. 4. for the heir in tail comes in paramount the Father. One Joytenant sole delivers the deed to re∣deliver to him,Joynte∣nant. he alone shall have a Detinue per cause of this special Bailment, 13 Rich. 2. bre. 648. though the deed doth belong unto both; for the bailment is the cause of the Action. Joynte∣nant survi∣vor. A enfeoffs B and C, and the heirs of B, and delivers all the deeds to B, which dies; C shall have a Detinue for the deed of Feoffment, but not for the other deeds, 34 Hen. 6.1. A. Coke 1. part. 2. A. Nat. br. 138. F. viz. which concern the In∣heritance; but the deed of Feoffment concerns the estate for life, as well as the Inheritance. If A makes a Release to B and C, and this de∣livers to B, which dies, C shall not have it, ibidem. for the Parchment and the Wax do belong to him to whom it was delivered. But if A and B Joyntenants per defeasible title, and S. J. makes a Release to them, the Survivor shall have it, 34 Hen. 6.1. per the Report Coke 1. part. 2. A. for this concerns the Land, and shall survive with the estate. Feoffment to two in Fee, the survivor shall have
all the deeds, Coke 1. part. 2. B. Buckhursts case; because the estate survives which the deeds con∣cern. If deeds concern more Lands, if the Ter∣tenant of any part happen upon the deed, he may detain it, because he hath an interest, 4 Hen. 7.10. pl. 4. 2 Eliz. Dyer 183. pl. 57. and it is reason he should have the deeds to maintain it as well as any other. Recusant shall not have an Action for any thing seised into the hands of the King,Recusant. 3 Jac. cap. 5. By Stat. vid. 22 Hen. 6.1. A Tenant for life dies,Remain∣der. he in the Remainder shall have Detinue for the deed, 9 Hen. 6.54. pl. 39. for now his title is come in possession, and so the deed that created it belongs to him. But if the Donor release to the Tenant for life, he in the Remainder shall not have a Detinue, 9 Hen. 5.54. pl. 39. Q. If Tenant for life die, he in the Remainder of a Copyhold shall have it, Coke 4. part. 22. B. for Copyholds are in many things governed by the rules of the Common Law, and so no difference betwixt them and other estates. Land is given to A for the life of B, the Re∣mainder to C in Fee, B dies, C shall have a Deti∣nue against A without request; because he had interest in the deed during the life of B, 33 Hen. 6.30. B. 35 Hen. 6.9. A. Moyle, in respect of his Re∣mainder. But there quaere, whether it lies against the Hus∣band, when the wife is dead without issue, without request and possession, because he is a Stranger to the estate.
Tertenant shall have a Detinue for the deeds,Tertenant. Coke 1. part. 2. A. which concern the Lands in his possession. The Lord by Escheat shall have a Detinue,Lord. Coke 1. part. 2. A. 10 Edw. 4.14.6. Moyle, for the deeds which concern the Land escheated. Against whom Detinue lies, 1. Of Chattels; 2. Of Deeds. Detinue lies against an Abbot and his Com∣moigue for a thing delivered to his Commoigue fore-deliver,Abbot. 3 Edw. 3.83. pl. 32. a thing delivered to them. An Administrator sold a thing,Admini∣strator. the Executor proves the Will, he shall have a Detinue against the Vendee of the Administrator, Com. 275. Foxes case; for now the Administrators title and pro∣perty is destroyed, and the sale accounted void irreplevisable, that is, that the Cattel or Goods ought not by Law to be replevied again. Avowant returns irreplevisable,Avowant. the other ten∣ders amends, and upon refusal shall have a De∣tinue, Coke 8. part. 147. A. for the property is in him, 10 Eliz. Dyer 280. pl. 14. notwithstanding the distress; for the distress did but put them in∣to the custody of the Law, and altered not the property. Baily of goods.Goods delivered to A to keep, and they are stole, yet Detinue lies against him, Coke 4. part. 83. B. Southcots case; for he ought to have kept them at his peril, and he shall have his remedy against the Thief. But if he take them to keep, as he would keep
his own, and they are stole, Detinue lies not, Coke 4. part. 83. for here he warrants not the safe keeping of them, for he cannot warrant his own from stealing. Goods delivered to B to deliver to C, yet C shall have a Detinue against B, 18 Hen. 6.9. A. Nat. br. 138. A. for the delivery of them to be de∣livered to B, vests the property of them in B, and not in C. Husband and wife.It lies not against husband and wife, supposing they detain, 38 Edw. 3.1. pl. 1. 13 Rich. 2. Breve 644. for the wife cannot detain, but it is the de∣tainer of the Husband. But of bailment to the Wise, dum sola fuit, and that the Husband did detain, 43 Edw. 3.18. pl. 1. Lib. Intra. 219. D. sect. 4. it lies. A Carrier loseth B's goods,Carrier. or they are stole from him, yet Detinue lies against him, Coke 4. part. 84. A. 2 Hen. 7.11. B. Townsend; for the property was in the owner, and the Law chargeth the Carrier with them. It lies against an Executor,Executor. but he shall not be charged but for his Detainer, 39 Edw. 3.5. pl. 21. in his own time, and not for the Testators De∣tainer. Crooke 118. pl. 62. A bails goods to B, which dies; in Detinue against the Executors the que∣stion was, whether they shall be named Execu∣tors or not, and it seemed they needed not, for the Detainer is the point of Action. Quaeret∣men, for they detain by virtue of their Execu∣torship. For Hill. 12 Jac. Ban. Regis, Isack & Clark 13 Hen. 4.12. pl. 2. 11 Hen. 4.45. pl. 20. 2 He
5.6. pl. 29. 21 Hen. 6. pl. 1. one shall not answer without the other, therefore they are charged for the Detainer only. Quaere tamen, for although they make but one person, yet this proves not but that they detain as Executors, and are so to be charged, as it seems. It lies against an Executor upon a rationabile parte bonorum, 17 Edw. 3.9. pl. 29. brought by the Feme of the Testator. An Executor shall have a Detinue for goods in the possession of the Executor of his Joynt-executor, if the said Joynt-executor will pay a debt to the value. 3. Eliz. Dyer 187. pl. 6. for the Executorship survives. It lies against a Stranger when they come to the possession of two,Estranger. 4 Edw. 4.9. pl. 11. Nat. br. 138. E. Q. Lessor shall have a Detinue for implements leased with the house, at the end of the term,Lessee. a∣gainst the Lessee, although they are wasted, 20 Hen. 6.16. pl. 2. for the property of them was not divested out of the Lessor by the lease. Trover of goods.Against him that finds goods, if they be wasted per wilful negligence; otherways if it be by ca∣sual means, Doct. & Stud. 129. B. or a Trover lies, for that he could not prevent. If a Horse be stole and sold in a market,Vendee. but not according to the Statute, the Owner shall have a Detinue, per 3 Mariae cap. 7. for the sale is void, and so the property is not altered. Administrator sold a thing, the Executor proves the Will, he shall have a Detinue against the Ven∣dee of the Administrator, Com. 275. Foxes case. See the reason before, that the sale is made void.
It lies against a Sheriff,Sheriff. where he returns upon a returna habenda quod averia elongata sunt, per Westm. 2. cap. 2. 9 Hen. 6.42. See before the reason. A Wife Tenant in tail dies before issues,Husband. quaere, if a Detinue lies against the Husband without re∣quest, 33 Hen. 6.30. B. A Feme sues goods dum sola fuit, and takes a Husband, Detinue lies against the husband and wife, Lib. Intr. 209. D. Sect. 4. 43 Edw. 3.18. pl. 1. for now the goods are come into possession of the husband by the marriage, and so they are both to be sued; for the cause of Action begun whilst the Feme was sole, and it is continued in the husband by the intermarriage and detainer since. If A. enfeoff B. with warranty,Feoffor. B. shall have a Detinue against A. for deeds that comprehend warranty, or are material for the Title, Coke 1. part. 2. because the warranty is for his benefit. If A. enfeoff B. without warranty, B. shall have it against A. for all the deeds concerning the land, the Feoffor needs not any deeds to make out the warranty. And if the thing lies in grant, then it lies a∣gainst the Feoffor, for all Coke 1. part. 1. Buck∣hursts case; for there is no warranty for him to make out, as it seems. And so in any case for a deed that makes his estate good, Nat. br. 138. K. for it is reason to let him have weapons requisite for his necessary de∣fence. Against a Lessee for life.A Lease made to A. for the life of B. remain∣der over to C. B. dies, C. shall have a Detinue a∣gainst A. without request, because C. had interest
in it before, 33 Hen. 6.30. B. and he knows that by the death of B. his estate is determined; sed quaere, if A. do not know B. is dead. For what things Detinue lies, 1. Of Chattels; 2. Of Deeds. Detinue ought to be of a thing certain,Certain. Nat. br. 138. A. because the very thing detained is to be recovered. A Detinue lies for money in a Bag, or Box, or Coffer, Nat. br. 138. A. for that may be certainly known. And this although the Seal be broken, 21 Edw. 4.30. pl. 25. Littleton, so that the bale be not broken. But otherwise it lies not, Nat. br. 138. A. 22 Hen. 8. Dyer 22. pl. 137. for then the money can∣not be known. Note, a Detinue was brought for one piece of Dornex of the value of 22 s. and tried at Glou∣cester Assizes, 5 Martii 15 Jac. Q. what Judg∣ment. Vide tamen 21 Hen. 7.82. pl. 3. Detinue brought of a piece of silver. Quaere what piece. It lies of Rationabile parte bonorum,Rationabile parte bono∣rum. Heir. 17 Edw. 3.9. pl. 29. by custome. See before. Custome, that the Heir shall have the principal goods. Detinue lies for them, 30 Edw. 3.2. pl. 9. 39 Edw. 3.6. pl. 24. & fol. 9. pl. 15. See before. Land leased with implements,Imple∣ments. at the end of the term Detinue lies for them, although wasted, 20 Hen. 6.16. pl. 2. See before.
Goods lostIf goods are lost Detinue lies, Nat. br. 138. E. against him that finds them, or a Trover. Goods bail.Goods bailed to deliver over, Detinue lies, Nat. br. 138. A. 18 Hen. 6.9. A. against the bailee, by the party to whom they should have been bailed over. See before. A. bails goods to B. which are stole, Detinue lies against B. for them, Coke 4 part. 84. Southcots case. Vid. antea. But if he receive them to keep, as he doth his own goods, and they are stole, it lies not, Coke 4. part. 83. Southcots case, 9 Edw. 4.40. pl. 22. Danby. Antea. Carrier loseth goods.Carrier loseth goods, or is robbed, yet Detinue lies against him, Coke 4 part. 84. 2 Hen. 7.11. B. Townsend. Antea. A. contracts for Corn to be delivered at a day to come,Corn. he shall have a Detinue at the day for this, No. Lib. Intra. 169. B. sect. 1. for by the con∣tract he had a property in the Corn. After divorce it lies for goods given in mar∣riage,Divorce. Nat. br. 139. A. 26 Hen. 8.7. pl. 1. 28 Hen. 8. Dyer 13. pl. 61. Vid. antea. It lies of a Horse, Cow, &c. or more Cows o Horses, Nat. br. 138. A. be the number what it will. It lies for the Plaintiff in Replevin,Replevin. for goods taken in Withernam, because he from whom they were so taken had not the property in them, 2 Hen. 4. br. debt 51. 6 Hen. 7.8. B. Quaere, if the Avowant shall have a Detinue for his goods taken in Withernam after appear∣ance and claim of the property, 11 Hen. 4.10. pl. 21. for he claim makes not the property.
Tender a∣mends in Replevin.The Plaintiff in a Replegiare after return ir∣replevisable upon tender of amends shall have a Detinue for the goods, Coke 8. part. 147. A. for he had the property in them, 10 Eliz. Dyer 280. pl. 14. notwithstanding such Writ. Vid. antea. Corn. Wine.A delivered B Corn and Wine, &c. and they perish, yet Detinue lies for them, Doct. & Stud. 129. A. Q. what shall be recovered, dammages t videtur. But if it be a thing that be to be redelivered,Horse. as a Horse, &c. if it be used in other manner than was agreed, and if it perish in default of the party to whom it was delivered, and Action lies, Doct. & Stud. 129.

Husband and Wife for box with deedsThe Husband and Wife count, that they were possessed of a Box sealed with Deeds concerning Lands of the Wife, &c. and lost them, and they came to the hands of the Defendant such a year, day and place, per Trover, &c. Lib. Intra. 209. B. Sect. 3.
Count of a box with Deeds, Lib. Intra. 202. B. Sect. 7. Though unsealed, yet it lies. Q. whether he must not shew what deeds particularly. Heir a∣gainst hus∣band and wife.Counts that his Brother, whose Heir he is, was seized of Land in Fee, and of a box sealed with Writings touching the Land, and he lost the box, and it came to the hands of the wife dum sola fit, and that his brother dies without issue and the Lands descended to him, and that the woman takes a Husband per quod, &c. Lib. Intra. 209. D. sect. 4. the Action lay against them; for the mar∣riage gains no property where the wife had none before. Heir against Executors,Heir. Lib. Intra. 210. A. sect. 5. of the Ancestor for things touching the Lands he inherits. The heir in a Detinue for a box with deeds ought to count that it was sealed, for otherwise it belongs to the Executors, 36 Hen. 6.27. pl. 26. 39 Edw. 3.7, 8. 41 Edw. 3.2. 11 Hen. 49. A. Paston. Q. how the sealing should make a diffe∣rence. And yet the sealing is not traversable, 41 Edw. 3.2. The heir ought to count of the certainty of the Land, and also how it was conveyed to him, 3 Hen. 6.19. pl. 31. 19 Hen. 11. pl. 29. or els it cannot appear the deeds belong unto him. He ought to count as heir, if he claims as heir, 7 Hen. 6.31. pl. 25. for every one ought to make his case as it is. But if he counts upon Bailment to rebail to him and his heirs, he need not to set forth the Title to the Land, 19 Hen. 6.41. pl. 84. for
there the Action is meerly founded upon the bail∣ment and detainer. If a Feoffee with warranty make a Feoffment with warranty, his Heir shall have a Detinue, and count specially, Coke 1. part. 2. A. Buckbursts case, as his case is. The heir counts that his Father was seised in fee, and demands the deed of the estate tail, and good; for his Father may discontinue and take it again in Fee, 38 Hen. 6.24. pl. 11. and therefore his count shall be presumed to be good. Count per Feoffee,Feoffee. Lib. Intra. 210. sect. 6. Note,Note. if the Writ be of bona & catalla the Count cannot be of Charters, 22 Edw. 4.12. pl. 32. for bona & catalla are not proper words generally to express Charters by, because they belong to the real, and not personal estate, and Goods and Chattels are usually intended personal things. And needs not say in the Count how the Defen∣dant came to them, 9 Hen. 5.14. pl. 22. 4 Edw. 4.9. pl. 11. Lib. Intra. 213. A. sect. 2. If the Writ be of a box with Deeds, the Count shall be accordingly, and not of a deed certain, 41 Edw. 3.2. pl. 5. 14 Hen. 6.4. A. Pleading ought to be plain and certain. The Plaintiff in a Detinue for Deeds for Land ought to make title to the Land in the Count, 33 Hen. 6.26. pl. 12. Prisot; for otherwise he ought to make request for the deeds, and then an Action upon the Case lies, if they be detained from him.
The Writ in Detinue, 1. Of Chattels; 2. Of Deeds. 1. In Comitatu dicitur injuste detinet, Regist. orig. 139. B. that is, in the County Court. Si quis rem mobilem vendicaverit, ex quacun∣que causa oblatam vel commodatam, debet in acti∣one sua definire pretium, & sic proponere actionem suam; quia ille à quo res petitur non tenetur pre∣citè ad rem restituendam, sed sub disjunctione, vel ad rem, vel ad pretium, Bracton Lib. 3. fol. 102. B. Where you may recover dammages for the thing detained, the value of it must be set forth, that the Jury may judge of them. If it be against an Executor it needs not name him Executor, because he is only charged with the Detainer, 29 Edw. 3.38. pl. 12. quaere tamen, for the Detainer is not in his own right. Rex,In Comi∣tatu. praecipimus tibi quod justicies L. quod juste, &c. reddat T. quandam chartam, vel duas chartas, vel quoddam scriptum obligatorium, vel conventionale, vel acquietantiae, vel quiete claman∣tiae, vel testamentarium, vel quoddam Chirogra∣phum, quod, quas vel quae, ei injuste detinet, ut dicit, sicut rationabiliter monstrare poterit, ne amplius, &c.

The Writ for Deeds in a Bag, Box, or Chest. vid. Regist. 159. B. Lib. Intra. 209. C. Sect. 1.
Note, when a man demands Writings in a bag, box, or chest, he needs not make mention in the Writ or Count what Writings they were, Regist. orig. 160. A. because they were together and en∣tire; but if loose it is otherwise. If one sue for Deeds in any Court without a Writ, a Prohibition lies; vide the Writ, Regist. orig. 159. B. Nat br. 139. C. for men must pro∣ceed as the Law directs, and they are compella∣ble so to do. A bails Deeds to rebail to him and his Heirs, there the Heir need not mention that he is Heir in the Writ, 5 Edw 3.159. pl. 24. for the Action is grounded upon the bailment. Yet quaere, for here is a special bailment. The Process in Detinue, 1. Before appearance. 2. After. Detinue for Chat∣tels.By the Common Law it was but a distress in∣finite, Nat. br. 139. A. 14 Hen. 6.1. that is, o distrain him by his goods and Chattels until he appear. But per 25 Edw. 3. cap. 17. a Capias was given to arrest the body of the party, to bring him in. But lies not in a Detinue for deeds, 5 Eliz. Dyer 223. pl. 24. viz. a Capias. Q. rationem, it may be, because that may not be satisfactory to the party to have the person. Detinue for deeds.The Process at Common Law was a Summons, Attachment and Distress, Nat. br. 139. A. 14. Hen. 6.1. viz. for deeds. But if the Deeds are in a box a Capias lies,
20 Edw. 4.3. pl. 12. 7 Hen. 4.2. pl. 8. 14. Hen. 6.1. pl. 1. 40 Edw. 3.25. pl. 28. Quaere rationem. But then it ought to count of a Deed in cer∣tain, 14 Hen. 6.1. pl. 12 and not generally. The Garnishee may be summoned by word,Garnishee.  Hen. 5.13. as well as by Writ. The Garnishor may have a Soire facias to issue out against the Garnishee, and if he make de∣fault, judgment shall be given against him, Lib. Ietra. 217. B. sect. 3. upon a nihil dicit. The Garnishment in Detinue, 1. Of Chattels. 2. Of Deeds. Garnishment is granted for saving the Condi∣tion,Garnish∣ment. if it be not performed; only upon this, whether the Defendant did perform it or not, and for no other cause, 40 Edw. 3.11. pl. 24. The Defendant in Detinue pleads, that the Plaintiff and B delivered this upon condition, and prays Garnishment, and had it allowed for a good plea, without shewing what the conditions were, 3. Hen. 4.18. for that will appear upon the Inter∣pleader of the parties. And also the reason is said to be, because the Conditions come not in debate between the Plain∣tiff and Defendant. Garnishment was prayed of the Heir and Ex∣ecutor of B, and accounted good; because it did not appear whether the Deeds in the box were real or Chattels, 14 Edw. 4.1. pl. 3. 21 Edw. 3.41. pl. 44. 48 Edw. 3.30. pl. 19. and so not certain, whether the Heir or Executor was to be sued.
Garnishment granted against an Executor, be∣cause it was supposed that the Testator was one that delivered the deeds, 14 Hen. 6.11. pl. 42. The Defendant shall have Garnishment, al∣though the Garnishee was a stranger to the De∣livery, 14 Edw. 4.2. Q. If the the Garnishee be returned dead, then his Heir or Executor shall be Garnie, and if it be for a Chattel, and it is returned that he is dead intestate, the Ordinary shall be Garnie, 48 Edw. 3.3. pl. 19. viz. before letter of Administration granted. So of the Successor of a Garnishee, Lib. Inter. 217. C. Executor shall have Garnishment upon a de∣livery to his Testator, Lib. Intra. 216. D. Sect. 1. and an Action thereupon brought against him. Enterpleader in Detinue, 1. Of Chattels. 2. Of Deeds. Note,Enter∣pleader. that there shall be no Enterpleader vn∣less the Defendant pray it, 18 Edw. 3.22. pl. 3 for the Enterpleader is to secure him against both parties, and if he desire not relief, the Court will not put him upon it. If the parties are by Attorneys, day shall be given over, because they shall not enterplead be in person, 9 Edw. 3.334. pl. 12. 24 Edw. 3.24 pl. 3. which they cannot then do, because they ap∣pear by Attorney. And if one come at his day by Attorney, the other shall not have Judgment against him,  Edw. 3.334. pl. 12. for there is no default in him.
Upon several Bailments there shall be no En∣terpleader, 19 Hen. 6.2. pl. 6. for there is no pri∣vity between the parties. But if the Desendant said that he was Joynt∣tenant, absque hoc that it was several, 19 Hen. 6.3. pl. 6. then it seems there shall be an Enterplea∣der. In Detinue the Defendant pleads another Writ, hanging by another, and prays Enterpleader, and it was granted for the mischief that might be; for other wise both might recover the Deeds, and so the Defendant be twice charged, 3 Hen. 6.43. pl. 20. which is unreasonable; for nemo his pu∣iri debet pro uno solummodo delicto. But there ought to be two several Writs de∣pending at one time, for the same thing, 3 Hen. 6. 35. pl. 31. and these ought to be returned at one day, 9 Hen. 6.36. pl. 9. Q. If the Defendant and the Garnishee do not a∣gree in plea, there shall be no Enterpleader, 14 Hen. 6.11. for then the garnishment will be to no purpose to determine the question. There shall be no Enterpleader unless the De∣fendant alledge, that both demanded one thing, 8 Edw. 4.6. for the Enterpleader is to determine, who hath the right to that one thing. If the Defendant after Garnishment make de∣fault, yet there shall be an Enterpleader, 2 Rich. 2. Enterpleader 13. for his default shall not prejudice a third person. If it be returned at several days, then a day shall be given over, at which day they shall Enter∣plead, 33 Hen. 6.25. pl. 8. viz. two Writs of De∣tinue for the same thing.
But if two Writs bear the same date, then he that first comes and demands answer, shall be an∣swered, 19 Hen. 6.4. Lib. Intr. 213. A, & B. sect. 1. Vigilantibus, non dormientibus jura subveniunt. Otherwise he that the Court assigns, 19 Hen. 6.4. that is, where they demand answer at the same time; for where the parties have equal right, it is in the discretion of the Court which Cause they will first proceed in, for they cannot proceed in both together, and such favour is no Injustice. Barr in Detinus; 1. Of Chattels. 2. Of Deeds. Accord is a good plea in Detinue of any goods personal,Accord. Coke 9. part. 78. B. Petoes case; but not of real. Barr that the goods were attached and delive∣red to him,Attach∣ment. only the custome of the City, Lib. Intr. 112. C. sect. 5. of London can warrant this plea in London. A lent Sheep to a Woman sole,Command. which took a Husband, which commanded the owner to take them again, who refused; this is a good barr as to the bailment in Detinue, 43 Edw. 3.21.10. for by the intermarriage the husband had power to redeliver the goods. A good barr that they were lent to deliver over,To deliver over. of the which he had a deed, Nat. br. 138. M. to prove it. Quaere, whether he ought not to plead in Curia hic prolat. A good plea by the Executor upon bailment to the Testator, that he, viz. the Executor, had de∣livered them to him that had the right in the goods, 9 Hen. 6.58. A.
Detinue is no plea, that the Plaintiff gave him the goods, because he may wage his Law,Given. 22 Edw. 4.29. pl. 10. that the goods were not delivered to him to redeliver. Detinue upon Trover, the Defendant pleads,Distress. that he did distrain for Rent reserved upon a Lease, a good barr, 27 Hon. 8.22. pl. 15. for here can be no Trover. In Detinue of a Horse,Estray. a good plea that he did estray into his ground, and that he proclaimed him and offered the Horse to the owner, if he would pay for his meat, which he refused to do, No. Lib. Intr. 169. D. sect. 2. for such a detainer is lawful. A good barr to say,Malady. the Horse was sick in De∣tinue at the time of the demand, 21 Edw. 4. De∣tinue br. 42. and so could not be delivered without danger of his death; and the Law loves the pre∣servation of things, and not their destruction. Non detinet a good barr, Lib. Intra. 211.Non deti∣net. D. sect. 1. & 2. fol. 112. C. sect. 4, & 5. for it is di∣rectly contrary to the supposal of the Writ, and so a good issue is tendred. And this may be by the Countrey, Lib. Intra. 211. D. Sect. 1, and 112. Sect. 4. C. viz. tried by a Jury as matter in fact. Or by wager of Law, 22 Edw. 4.29. pl. 10. Lib. Intra. 112. C. Sect. 5. 5 Edw. 3. 145. pl. 4. 27 Edw. 3.83. pl. 6. 4 Edw. 3.41. by the Oath of the Defendant. Although the bailment be by deed, for the Detinet is the substance of the Action, 27 Hen. 8.22. pl. 14. and not the bailment.
An Executor may wage his Law, 11 Hen. 6.40. pl. 25. 3 Hen. 6.38. Martin, of a bailment made to the Testator. Quaere, or whether upon the detinet. Non detinet by the Law gager, although the bailment be by others hands, 8 Hen. 6.10. pl. 26. 33 Hen. 6.8. B. Moyle, is a good barr. If an Executor pays a debt of the Bailors to the value of the goods,Payment to the va∣lue. and dies, this is a good barr in Detinue brought against the surviving Ex∣ecutor, 3 Eliz. Dyer 187. pl. 6. Q The Defendant said,Pledge. that the Plaintiff pledged them for money, which is not paid; this is a good barr, 34 Hen. 6.42. pl. 13. for here is no bail∣ment, but the goods are in custody of the Law. Corn is lent, &c. and it perisheth; this is no barr,Perish. Doct. & Stud. 129. A. in a Detinue for the Corn, for the Borrower ought to make it good at his own peril. A Horse used in other manner than was agreeds no barr if he perish. Vid. antea; for he is a trust abused, which the Law hates. But if he be used in the same manner, if he perish not in desault of the party to whom he was lent, it is a good barr, Doct. & Stud. 129. A. for here was no trust deceived, nor fault in the Bai∣lee. No plea for a Carrier or Ferryman, that he was robbed,Robbery. Coke 4. part. 84. Southcots case,  Hen. 7.11. B. Townsend, but they must take their remedy against the Thieves, and they are by Law answerable to the owners of the goods. So if goods are delivered to keep, Coke 4. part. 83. B. for such an acceptance implies a war∣ranty
to keep them safe, and to redeliver them. But it is a good plea, if they are taken to keep as my own, Coke 4. part. 83. for there is no such warranty implied. Vid. antea. Recovery in Trespass a good barr in Detinue,Recovery. 20 Hen. 7.58. B. Crooke; for there shall not be a double recovery for one thing. The bailment is not traversable where he may wage his Law,Travers. 8 Edw. 4.3. pl. 7. for there his Oath that he detains not is sufficient; for if he detains not, there could be no bailment. No barr that the Horse was sold in a Market overt, unless it were tolled,Vendee. according to the Sta∣tute, 1 & 2 Phil. & Mariae, cap. 7. for no property is altered by such a sale. Vid. antea. Detinue for Deeds as Heir,Bastardy. Bastardy is a good plea, 35 Hen. 6.9. pl. 12. for if a Bastard, he is no Heir. A bailed to B to rebail, and dies,Feostment having two Sons, which makes partition, he which had the Land comprehended in the deed delivered en∣feoffs B; this is a good barr, 17 Edw. 3.12. pl. 45. for by the purchase the deed belongs to B. Warranty and Assets is no barr against the issue in Tail in Detinue,Warrant, 9 Hen. 6.15. pl. 5. 4 Hen. 7.10. pl. 4. for he comes in by the Donor. Rebailment in another County a good barr,Rebail∣ment. because he cannot wage his Law, 22 Hen. 6.15. pl. 27. because the bailment was in one County, and the Action is brought in another County. Release per the Plaintiff a good barr,Release. Lib. Intra. 290. B. Sect. 1. for by the Release the pro∣perty was altered.
The Defendant pleads bailment of deeds by the Plaintiff,Retainer. upon condition, that if his wife the Plaintess survive the Plaintiff, that the De∣fendant should retain it, and that his wise is alive, a good barr; but then he ought to shew what Lands they concern, 18 Edw. 4.18. that it may be known unto whom the deed belongs. Infancy is no plea,Infancy. because he may avoid an obligation in debt, 14 Hen. 6.11. pl. 41. by plead∣ing deins age. A good bar that the Garnishee brought a De∣tinue against the Defendant,Recovery. and prays Garnish∣ment against the Plaintiff, which makes default, and he had judgment, 34 Hen. 6.47. pl. 13. 21 Hen. 6.35. pl. 2. per Newton. Garnishee pleads release between the time of this Action brought,Release. and the delivery, & quaere, 20 Hen. 6.28. pl. 23. 49 Edw. 3.13. But 39 Edw. 3.13. adjudged, that it is a good barr, and so it seems the Law to be. The Judgment in Detinue; 1. Of Chattels. 2. Of Deeds. Against the Defen∣dant. 1.

Sect. 4. & dampua sua, &c. and upon the return of the Writ, if it appears that W. did not deliver the Corn, then the judgment shall be for the value with dammages and costs. So see the difference, where the Plaintiff himself delivers the thing, and where another.
The Plaintiff shall have judgment to recover the thing named,Plaintiff 17 Edw. 3.45. 1 Rich. 3.1. & 2. or the value of it, and dammages for detaining of it, as appears above. The judgment was, that he should recover his Chattels, and his dammages, 21 Hen 6.36. A. Bracton, Lib. 3. fol. 102. B. non tenetur precise ad rem restituend. sed sub disjunct. vel ad rem, vel ad pretium; either the thing, or the value of it indammages. Against the Defen∣dant.The judgment was, that he should recover the deeds, if they are found, and also dmmages for the detainer; and if not found, then all in dam∣mages, 7 Hen. 6.31. pl. 25. 22 Hen. 6.41. pl. 17. as well for the deeds as for the detainer of them. And this shall be, although it be proved that the Defendant burnt the deed, 17 Edw. 3.45. pl. 1. for that shall not excuse. Ideo confideratum est, quod praedictus. A. recuperet versus praefat. B. pyxidem praedictam cum chartis, &c. Lib. Intra. 218. A. Sect. 1. the box with the writings. The Heir in Detinue had judgment to recover one box, with as much as was in it contained that belongs to him, 5 Edw. 3.159. B. intended to be of writings. Against the Defen∣dant and the Gar∣nishee.The judgment was, that he should recover the deeds against the Defendant, & haberet liberatio∣nem versus the Garnishee, 21 Hen. 6.36. A. Lib. Intra. 219. D. sect. 17. 9 Hen. 6.38. pl. 13.7. Hen. 6.45. pl. 27. This is a double judgment, viz. of the right, and of the possession. But if Judgment be given upon default of the Garnishee before appearance, no dammages shall
be given, 20 Hen. 6.4. pl. 27. for this is not the Defendants fault. If the Plaintiff and Defendant make default, the Garnishee shall have Judgment, and the Plain∣tiff and Defendant in misericordia, 40 Edw. 3.39. pl. 15. for his unjust vexation. Execution in Detinue; 1. Of Defendant. 2. Against the Garnishee. 3. Of what Lands. 4. Of what Goods. Execution against the Defendant by distress for the thing detained and recovered,Chattels. Nat. Lib. Intr. 169. C. sect. 1. 20 Edw. 4.3. pl. 12. No. Lib. Intr. 170. D. 17. A. 6 Rich. . Execution. But if the thing be not delivered to the Plain∣tiff, then he shall have execution for the dam∣mages by Capias, Lib. Intra. 216. B. sect. 6. 20 Edw. 4.3. pl. 12. against the person of the Defen∣dant. For a Capias was given in the main Process per 25 Edw. 3. cap. 17. and by consequence a Capi ad satisfaciend. in execution by the equity of that Statute. At the Common Law execution was for dam∣mages by fieri facias, and also for the goods, Lib. Intra. 216. B. sect. 8. to be levied upon the goods of the Defendant. For dammages by fieri facias, and for the thing by distress of the Goods and Chattels, 6 Rich. 2. Execution 45. The Plaintiff and Defendant make default, Garnishee had Judgment and distress against the Defendant, 40 Edw. 3.39. pl. 15. Vid. antea.
Distress issued forth in execution, Lib. Intra. 215. C. sect. 1. 20 Edw. 4.3. pl. 12. 22 Hen. 6.41. pl. 17. But Capias lies not, 5 Eliz. Dyer 223. pl. 24. 21 Hen. 6.42. vid. antea. If the deeds concern Lands, 8 Hen. 6.29. pl. 24. 14 Hen. 6.1. pl. 1. But for the dammages, if they will not deliver them, a Capias lies, 22 Hen. 6.41. pl. 17. 20 Edw. 43. pl. 12. If deeds are in a box, then a Capias ad satis∣faciendum lies in execution against the person, 7 Hen. 4.2. pl. 8. 14 Hen. 6.1. pl. 1. 40 Edw 3.25. pl. 28. But for dammages at the Common Law it was but a fieri facias, Lib. Intra. 216. B. sect. 7. upon the goods and Chattels. Or a levari facias, Coke 3. part. 12. A. upon Lands and goods. And this only within the year, for after the year the party had but an Action of Debt, Coke 3. part. 12. A. vid. antea. Unless the Suit be continued, 33 Hen. 6.49. pl. 33. But by Westm. 2. cap. 450. a Scire facia is given after the year to revive the judgment, and by Westm. 2. cap. 18. an Elegit is given, antea, upon the Lands. And by the twenty fifth of Edw. 3. cap. 17. Ca∣pias is given in Process for deeds in a Box, and by consequence a Capias ad satisfaciend. in execution, Lib. Intra. 216. A. Sect. 3.40. Edw. 3.25. pl. 28. antea.
If dammages shall be recovered against a Gar∣nishee,Deeds. the execution shall be of the goods and Lands of the Garnishee, 7 Hen. 6.45. pl. 27. 9 Hen. 6.38. pl. 13. 19 Hen. 6.4, But not of his body, because he was not party to the Writ, 7 Hen. 6.45. pl. 27. 9 Hen. 6.38. pl. 13. upon which the Action was brought, but comes in by Garnishment. But the Book of Entries 216. B. sect. 6. Capias ad satisfaciendum was a warded against a Garnished for dammages recovered against him. Quaere, if as well for the detainer as for the thing detained.

A Steward of Pypowders forfeits 5 l. if they hold plea,Action po∣pular. unless the Plaintiff, or his Attorney, swear that the thing was within the Jurisdiction, and in the Fair, 1 Rich. 3. cap. 6. Debt, in what Court it lies. IN the County Court,o Nat. br. 119. G. Regist. orig. 139. A. In a Village, City, and Burrough Liberty, Nat▪ br. 119. K. In Pypowders, viz. a Court held in a Fair. But by the 17 Edw. 4. cap. 2. the Plaintiff or his Attorney ought to swear that it was in the Fair, and within the Jurisdiction, 1 Rich. 3. cap. 6. and if he refuse, the Defendant shall go quit by the Statute; for it appears not that the Court had Jurisdiction to hold plea.
It lies in the Marshalsey, if both are of the houshold of the King, otherwise not; but the Plaintiff needs not shew this in his Count, and the proceeding there is by bill, Coke 10. part. 61. Case of Marshalsey; for if it be not so the De∣fendant may demur to the jurisdiction of the Court. In Chancery, for a person priviledged de lies, viz. in that Court; for the Chancery to some purposes is a Court of Law as well as of equity. In the Exchequer by quo minus, Coke 8 part. 6 A. Trollops case; but then the Plaintiff  make himself an Accountant to the King. So if one usurp upon a Franchise of the King where the Plaintiff had Fee Farm, the Fee Fare shall sue by a Quo minus, 32 Hen. 6.24. pl. 7.  the Exchequer; for he is an Accountant to  King. An Executor shall have a Quo minus, when  is a debtor to the King by his own act, 8 Hen. 4.10. pl. 19. as Executor. In Com. Ban. Nat. br. 119. G. Debt lies not for a popular Action,Note. or upon penal Law, but in one of the four Courts of Re∣cord at Westm. per Statut. 18 Eliz. cap 5. Gk part. Grgories case; for those Courts are fine to interpret Statutes, and not inferiour Courss.
Who shall have Debt. If a Baily account for his Master,Account∣ant. and surplu∣sage be found due to his Master, he shall have debt for it, Nat. br. 121. I. the Count, Lib. Intra. 150. D. sect. 1. quaere, if it be not meant where the Baily accounts with his Master. But a Receiver shall not, Nat. br. 121. I. 38 Hen. 6.5. pl. 14. Mich. 12 Jac. Ban. Regis, Coun∣tess of Suffolke & Floyde; for the Law takes not so much notice of a Receiver, as of a Baily. Administrator shall not have debt until,Admini∣strator. 31 Edw. 3. cap. 11. Nat. br. 120. D. Coke 9. part. 39. A. Hensloes case; for the Common Law takes no notice of an Administrator. 1. An Administrator ought to count, that he which committed the Administration, was the Ordinary of the place where the intestate died, 31 Hen. 6.23. pl. 5. Com. 277. A. per Dyer. If it be a particular Jurisdiction, he must say, cui ad∣ministratio pertinuit. 2. he ought to name the place where the Ad∣ministration was to him committed, 35 Hen. 6.31. pl. 39. Danby & Moyle; because it is tra∣versable. 3. He needs not name the Ordinary by his Christian name, 7 Hen 4.10. pl. 18. for the place where makes it certain enough who it is. But in a Writ de Colligend. he shall be named. Q. de ceo brief. An Administrator shall have debt upon, 1 Edw. 2. cap. 14. for money given to Chantery.
If the Ordinary release a debt to a Debtor of the Intestate, and afterwards grants Administra∣tion to A; yet A shall have debt against the Debtor, for the Release is void in Law, 18 Hen. 6.23. Coke 9. part. 39. A. vide Crooke 127. pl. 90. for the Debt is not the Ordinaries. Attorney shall have Debt for his Fees,Attorney. and Fees of Counsel, and costs of Suits, Nat. br. 121. L. 21 Hen. 6.4. Quaere of Counsells Fees, if not expended by his Clients direction. If J. deliver money to bail over,Bailor. or to a Mer∣chant to trade with for me, or to be given is Alms, or upon a condition to rebail, if he break the trust, J. shall have debt against him, 28 Hen. 8. Dyer 22. pl. 135. 11 Hen. 6.39. pl. 3. 42 Edw. 3 9. pl. 7. Crooke, 21 Hen. 7.69. pl. 2. per Fro∣icke; for if the trust be not performed, the money belongs to the Bailor. A is bound to the Husband and Wife,Husband. the Husband alone shall have the Action, 3 Hen. 6.37. pl. 35. 12 Rich. 2. bre. 637. in his own name only, if he will. Or in both their names, 39 Edw. 3.5. pl. 19. 43 Edw. 3.10. pl. 31. 3 Hen. 6.37. pl. 35. 12 Rich 2. bre. 639. 16 Edw. 4.8. for the Husband may interest his Wife in the debt. Husband and wife.Husband and Wife assign Auditors to receive  debt due to the Wife dum sola fuit, and brought debt for the Arrearages in both their names, and good; because the wife was the cause of the Acti∣on, 16 Edw. 4 8. pl. 4. because the debt was due to her dum sola. Husband and wife lease for years Lands of the wife rendering Rent. the Husband dies, and the
second Husband brought debt, and good, 28 Edw. 3.90. pl. 4. for the Law creates a privity in him. A Woman leases at will rendering rent, and takes a husband, the Rent is behind, they joyn in debt, and good, Coke 5. part. 10. Hensteads case; for the marriage shall not determine her will so as to extinguish the debt. A Woman shall not have an Action against her husband, although she is Executrix, 8 Edw. 3. 330. pl. 48. for she cannot sue her self, and the husband and wife are but one person in Law. A is bound to the husband and wife, and they are divorced causa prae-contractus, and they brought debt in both their names, No. Lib. Intra. 121. sect. 5. for the divorce makes the marriage void ab initio, and so the obligation is void, and therefore the Action not well brought, as it seems. B had a Rectory in right of his wife for years, and they both joyned in debt upon the Statute of 2 Edw. 6. for not setting forth of Tithes, Hill. 39 Eliz. Ban. Regis Rot. 699. and good; for the Action is grounded by reason of the wife. Lease for years rendering Rent by the husband and wife, husband may have debt in his own name, 7 Edw. 4 5. pl. 16. for the Rent belongs to him. The same Law is, if the Reversion be assigned to the husband and wife, although that the hus∣band count as Assignee, Trin. 12 Jac. Ban. Regis, Wyats case. Quaere, whether in both cases the Action may not be brought in both their names.
Husband and wife sold the Land of the wife, the husband alone shall have debt, 48 Edw. 3.18. pl. 4. for the money belongs only to him. Husband and wife recover dammages, the husband alone shall have debt for them, 16 Hen. 6. bre. 939. for the husband shall have them. A woman Tenant in dower of Rent takes a husband and dies, the husband shall have debt for the Arrearages during the Coverture, Nat br. 121. C. 14 Hen. 6.26. A. 10 Hen. 6.11. 22. Hen. 6.25. 26 Edw. 3.64. for the Rent was due to him. And by 32 Hen. 8. Ca. 37. the husband shall have debt for the Arrearages before the Cover∣ture, Coke 5. part. 51. A. Ognels case, else the Rent would be lost. Annuity to the wife that takes a husband, Ar∣rearages incurr, the wife dies, the husband shall have debt, because it is more than a thing in Acti∣on, Hill. 29. Eliz. Com. Ban. St. Legers, for it is a duty incurred. But if it be but for a thing in action before the Coverture, as an Obligation, the husband shall not have it, Nat. br. 121. C. 39. Hen. 6.26. pl. 38. be∣cause of the incertainty, whether it were due to the wife, or not. But during the Coverture the husband may re∣lease it, 17 Edw. 3.66. pl. 78. Hill; for that pas∣seth nothing but by way of extinguishment of his right, if he have any. Husband makes his wife Executrix, which takes a husband, and makes him Executor, and dies; the husband brought debt for the debt to the former husband, and good, 4 Hen. 6.31.
for now it is become due to him as Executor of an Executor. Clerk of the Peace.It lies in the name of the Clerk of the Peace for the Hundred against the Village, where de∣fault is made in Hue and Cry, by the Statute of 27 Eliz. cap. 13. and reason, because thereby the Hundred becomes liable to pay the money rob∣bed. Colledge in Oxon.A Colledge shall have debt for Commons of a∣ny Student, Pasch. 9 Jac. Ban. Regis, Colledge of St. Johns in Oxford versus Brickeden. Q. if the Student be of the Foundation. Colledge of Physi∣cians.Colledge of Physicians, for practising without License shall have debt upon the Statute; but the Master sole shall not, Hill. 11 Jac. Ban. Regis, Col∣ledge of Physicians versus Dr. Tenant, Lib. Re∣ports, title Plaints. Q. Debt lies by a Conusee of a Statute or Recog∣nizance,Stat. Mer∣chant Sta∣ple. Conusee. According to 23 Hen. 8. Recogn. Counsellor Nut br. 122. D. 11 Hen. 6.49. pl. 7. 36 Hen. 6.2. pl. 2. 39 Hen. 6.3. pl. 5. 22 Eliz. Dyer 369. pl. 52. 13 Rich. 2. bre. 649. upon the Statute or Recognizance. Debt upon a retainer to be his Counsellor for 40 s. per annum; but then he ought to count that he was of his counsel, or was ready to be, 37 Hen. 6.8. B. Prisott, if required. But if I retain a Sergeant at Law for A, he shall not have debt for his salary against me, 31 Hen. 6.9. B Fortescue; for he is retained for his Client, and it is reason he should pay him. ExecutorExecutor shall have debt for a debt due to the Testator, 11 Hen. 6.7. for he is in place of the Testator.
Executor of an Executor shall have debt, 25 Edw. 3. Ca. 5. & sic in infinitum, as it seems. Executor shall not have debt before probat of the Testament, 7 Hen. 4.18. Coke 5. part. 28. A. Midletons case, Com. 278. Foxes case, Perkin 193. for before that he is not Executor in the eye of the Law. But if (pendente breve) the Testament be pro∣ved, it sufficeth, Pasch. 43 Eliz. Com. Ban. Wal∣mesly; for that relates to the death of the Testa∣tor, and so includes the time of hanging the Action. Feme.Rent services granted to the husband and wife for life, the husband dies, the wife shall have the Arrearages that did accrue in the life of the hus∣band, and debt for them after the estate ended, 29 Edw. 3.40. pl. 19. for here is a surviving estate in the wife. Grantee of a Rever∣sion. Annuity.Grantee of a Reversion shall not have debt for Rent upon a Lease for years before Attornment, Nat. br. 121. N. for before Attornment the Rever∣sion passed not. But a Devisee shall have it, Nat. br. 121. N. Mich. 14 Jac. Ban. Regis, Bayliffs and Burgesses case of Ipswiche; for there it passeth by the will. So Bargainee shall have it, Coke 3. part. 24. A. Walkers case; for it passeth by enrolment of the Deed. Heir.A is bound to B and his heirs, B dies, his heirs shall not have debt, Nat. br. 120. I. but the Execu∣tor; but contrary where A binds himself and his heirs to B.
But if a penalty be granted to one and his heirs, then the heir shall have debt, Nat. br. 120. M. 11 Hen. 4.84. 28 Hen. 8. Dyer 24. pl. 149. for that is a present duty, wherein the heir hath interest. The heir shall have debt for the reasonable part of the goods, where the custome gives it him, Nat. br. 122. L. for this is a customary duty, for which the Law will give a remedy. But if there be no such custome it lies not, Regist. orig. 142. B. 40 Edw. 3.38. pl. 19. 7. Edw. 4.20. pl. 23. 30 Edw. 3.26. A. seton. Regist. orig. 141. B. for the Common Law takes no such notice of the heir, to have any goods as heir. For the Statute of Magna Charta is but one forspris, and for that an Action shall not be found∣ed upon it, vide Lib. Intra. 541. by reason of the incertainty of the meaning of the Statute in that point. But Nat. br. 122. L. Glanvill, Lib. 12. cap. 20. 17 Edw. 3.9. pl. 29. this is by the Common Law. quaere. Custome, that the heir shall have the principal Chattels, &c. he shall have debt for them, 30 Edw. 3.2. pl. 9. 39 Edw. 3.6. pl. 24. & fol. 9. pl. 15. The Law takes notice, and maintains ancient Cu∣stomes. Lessor.Lessor shall have debt for Rent reserved upon a Lease at will, Coke 5. part. 10. Hensteads case, Lit∣tleton 15. by reason of the privity of the Con∣tract betwixt the Lessor and the Lessee. And so for a Lease for years, 7 Rich. 2. this seems a stronger case. Tenants in Common make a Lease rendring Rent, they ought to joyn, Littleton 72. in the
Action in respect of their joyning in the Lease, and so a joynt interest passed. Ordinary.The Ordinary shall not have debt, because he hath not absolute interest in the things of the Intestate, Coke 9. part. 33. Hensloes case, Nat. br. 120. D. but hath it only as a Conduit-pipe, to de∣rive it to others to whom the Law directs. Parson.A Parson shall have debt for not setting out of Tithes, by the Stat. of 2 Edw. 6. cap. 13. and re∣cover treble dammages. Physician.A Physician shall have debt for Physick and Diet, Lib. Intra. 187. B. Sect. 1. upon a quantum me∣ruit, if there be no special contract. Recusant.Recusancy shall be pleaded in disability for such Lands and Tenements which are not seized into the Kings hands, 3 Jac. cap. 5. in disability of the person to sue. Q. Robbery.The party robbed shall have an Action against the Hundred per le Stat. 27 Eliz. cap. 13. But he ought to bring his Action within the year after the Robbery done, 27 Eliz. cap. 13. And the day of the Robbery shall be accounted parcel of the time, Pasch. 15. Jac. Com Ban. per 2 Justices, as it seems, because the Law is pe∣nal. Quaere tamen. Steward.Steward of a Court retained by word for such a sum per annum, shall have debt for his salary, 8 Eliz. Dyer 248. pl. 79. Coke 4. part. 30. A. Servant.Servant shall have debt for his salary, 11 Hen. 6.10. pl. 20. upon the contract which created a duty. One retained in England to do service beyond the Sea, shall have debt in England where the retainder was, Nat. br. 120. E. and not where
the service is done, because it is beyond Sea; aliter quaere. Servant retained by a Corporation without deed, shall not have debt for his salary, 4 Hen. 7.6. Com. 91. B. for such Retainer is null in Law, and the Servant could not have been compelled to serve. Successor. Sole Corpo∣ration con∣sists of one person.One sole Corporation shall not have a personal thing in Succession, Coke 4. part. 65. A. Fulwoods case, 19 Hen. 6.44. pl. 94. 20 Edw. 4.2. vide 32 Hen. 8. Dyer 48. pl. 14. for personal things cease with the person. Unless the Custome will warrant it, Coke 4 part 65. A. Fulwoods case. Custome, if it be not un∣reasonable, makes a Law. But a Corporation aggregate, that is, consisting of many persons, shall have an Action for a per∣sonal thing in succession, Coke 4. part. 65. A. 20 Edw. 4.2. Master of an Hospital recovers dammages, the Successor shall have them, 19 Hen. 6.44. pl. 94. for the benefit of the house. Abbot recovers dammages in battery, and is re∣moved or created Bishop; his Successor shall have them, because he recovered them, but to the use of his house, 22 Hen. 6.4. B. for he could sue in no other capacity being a dead person in Law. A is bound to an Abbot sole, the Successor shall have debt, 47 Edw 3.23. pl. 57. the Count, Lib. Intra. 179. A. sect. 7. for it was to the use of the house. An Obligation made to Churchwardens, their Successors shall not have an Action being their Executors, for this is but an Office and cannot
be derived to others; but as their Successors  seems it may. Q If A contracts for B with the Chirurgeon s so much as to cure him,Chirurge∣on. if B die the Chirurge shall have debt against A, for it is a good contract 37 Hen. 6.9. A. Moyle, to bind it. Q. If J sell a Horse, and earnest is given or ∣set, J shall have debt for the money, 14 Hen. 8.19. br. Contract. 15. Coke 3. part. 22. A. Walken case, and the losing of the Earnest will not avoid the Contract, as the vulgar opinion is.

Against whom Debt lies. An Abbot shall be charged for Debt due by him which enters into Religion,Abbot. Nat. br. 121. O.  Hen. 5.8. pl. 18. into the house whereof he is Abbot; for the person himself cannot be charged, and the Abbot takes into the Covent cum caret isua. But the 45 Edw. 3.10. pl. 1. to the contrary; rere: but it seems here as not Law. If Accountant be found in Arrearages,Account∣ant. debt lies against him; for here is a duty created by ad∣judging him in Arrear.

A Recovery against one Administrator upon a nihil dicit is no plea in debt against all, Hill. 38 Eliz. Com. Ban. Furthow versus Furthow; for they are all liable, and it may be there was no sa∣tisfaction upon the recovery. If an Administrator waste the goods, and after the Administration is dissolved and granted to
another, Dbt lies against the former, Coke 6. part. 18, & 19. Packmans case; for at the time of the wasting he was Administrator, and chargea∣ble.

A woman covert being a sole Merchant, may be sued in London by the custome of the City without the husband; but not in Com. Ban. 9 Edw. 4.3. because that Law extends not out of the City. If A and his wife covert by the name of his
wife sole are obliged, it lies not against the wife, because it is a void obligation as to the wife, 14 Hen. 4.30. pl. 39.

If an Executor account before Auditors, debt lies for the Arrearage, 2 Hen. 4.13. pl. 2. 19 Hen. 6.5. A. Fortescue; for by his Accounting he sub∣mits to pay what shall be found arrear.

And likewise if he bought it in his own Name, and it comes to the use of his Master, it lies against his Master, ibidem. for the Masters making use of it shews his assent, and that it was for his bene∣fit.

If a Prisoner escape by assent,Sheriff. although the Sheriff take him again, yet debt lies. Coke 3. p 44. Boytons case. 19 Hen. 4.10. viz. assent of the Sheriff or Gaoler; for thereby the debt is discharged as to the prisoner. Unless the Sheriff brought one per habeas C∣pus, then if he had him at the day, it sufficeth Coke 3. part 44. Boytons case. yet he ought not  set him at large in the mean time.
Unless the party be in execution, Coke 5. part. 9. Frosts case. 7.

The ancient Sheriff makes no mention of one in execution in his indenture delivered to the new Sheriff, of prisoners in his custody; this is an e∣scape in the old Sheriff, but not in the new; for the new is not charged with him: but if the old Sheriff die, the other ought to take notice of the prisoners; but if the escape be in the vacancy, viz. before the new Sheriff is elected and sworn, debt lies not. Coke 3. part. 71 & 72. Westbyes case. 10 Edw. 3.375. pl. 28. for before he was not chargeable, for he was no offender in Law. If one be in execution, yet debt lies against the Sheriff, 7 Eliz.

And this is but hac vice, if there be no other words to shew the continuance of it, 32 Hen. 6.10. A. Billinge. And so upon any grant hac vice certain or un∣certain. Q. 2. Annuity or Rent-charge granted for years,Annuity. debt lies not during the term. But the 5 Edw. 4. 42 B. debt lies; and it seems this is Law; if it lie not, it seems it is because the Grantee may di∣strain and charge the Land. But against a customer it lies, if it be to be paid out of the customs of London after delivery of a Liberate, Nat. br. 121. F. for then it is a duty ve∣sted. It lies for Executors or administrators of the Grantee per Stat. 32 Hen. 8. cap. 37. viz. of an Annuity or Rent-charge. And after the term ended, it lies for the Gran∣tee, Lib. Intra. 151. C. sect. 1. for then there is no other remedy for it. 3. Annuity for life,For Life. debt lies not for this du∣ring life, 19 Hen. 6. 42 A. 37 Hen. 6.35. A. But a Distress or a Writ of Annuity, and the Land is chargeable. But against a customer it lies, Nat. br. 121. F. ntea▪ for his person is chargeable ratione officii. Also if a Parson or Prebend, &c. hath such annui∣ty
and resigne or be dispossessed, it lies for the arrerages, Coke 4. part. 48. B. Ognels case. For by his resignation it is meerly a personal thing, and the Land is not chargeable. So his Executors shall have debt by the com∣mon Law, Coke 4. part. 49. A 22 Eliz. Dyer. 37. pl. 62. Coke 10. part. 61. B. For it is accounted part of the Testators personal estate. But if it be a Rent-charge seck or service, debt lies not for any so long as the Estate continues, Coke 4. part. 49. A. Ognels case. For there the person is not chargeable. Although it have continuance but to a special intent, Coke 7. part. 39. B. For the Law takes not notice of such intents, but looks on it as up∣on a continuing Estate. But after it be determined, debt lies for the party or his Executor, Coke 4. part. 49. Ognels case. Nat. br. 121. E. Coke 4. part. 49. Ognels case. 27 Hen. 6.1. pl. 4. because the realty is re∣solved into the personality, and so the person chargeable. 4. Annuity in Tayl general or special, debt lies not during the annuity, Coke 4. part. 48. B. for the former reason. So of a Rent-seck, service or charge, vid. an∣tea.

But it lies not by a Receiver, 38 Hen. 6.5. pl. 14. Mich. 12. Jac. Ban. Regis. Countess de Suf∣folk versus Floyde. For a receiver is not to lay out for his Master.

Q. tamen; for custom makes Law in many cases. And the account is upon the Common Law, No. Lib. intra. 565. A. sect. 2. viz. per legen terrae. So debt lies where the custom is that the heir shall have the principal goods, 30 Edw. 3.2. pl. . 39 Edw. 3.6. pl. 24. & fol. 9. pl. 15. for thereby they are a duty vested in him.

But for Executors it is always in the detinet, ibidem; for the debt is due to the Testators estate, and is only detained from the Executors, in re∣tardationem testamenti Testatoris. If Debt be by Administrators,Admini∣strator. all of them must be named, Regist. orig. 140. A. for they have a joynt Authority, which must be pursued. The Writ shall be in the Detinet only, Regist. orig. 139. B. for the former reason. If one recover against Administrators, and bring debt upon the Record, the Writ shall be detinet only, 11 Hen. 4.56. pl. 2. vide 11 Hen. 6.7. 16.39. For by Newton, fol. 37. debet imports his proper debt, being upon his own Contract, 20 Hen. 6.5. A. Fortescue; for they owe nothing themselves, but only do detain in anothers place.

In ancient time in such case it was in the debet & detinet; but not at this day, because that debet supposeth a property which the Executor hath not; so that it is to be noted, that ancient Pre∣sidents
may be altered upon good grounds. All Executors ought to joyn in Debt, although that some refuse the Administration, Regist. orig. 140.

L. where an Executor sold goods and brought Debt sole for the money, and it was awarded good without his Companions; it seems it was, because he solely made the sale. Quaere tamen. An Executor and an Executor of his Fellow Executor joyned in debt, and good, 7 Edw. 3.26. pl. 22. Q. But the 28 Edw. 3.92. pl. 11. Wilby, this is not Law; for 29 Edw. 3.49.23. the surviving Executor shall have it sold, and so I conceive the Law to be. Wife Exe∣cutrix.A Wife executrix in debt, by her and her hus∣band the Writ shall suppose both Executors, 2 Hen. 6.49. pl. 8. for conformities sake; for the wife cannot sue without her husband. Feme covert Executrix shall not have debt without the husband, 8 Edw. 3.330. pl. 48. 10 Edw. 3.381. pl. 63. 21 Hen. 6.30. pl. 17. Marke∣ham, Regist. orig. 140. for the aforesaid reason. Against ExecutorsThe Writ shall be detinet only, Nat. br. 119. M. Regist. orig. 139. B. antea. But for Rent due in the time of the Executor, it shall be in the debet & detinet, Coke 5.31. Har∣graves case, 7 Edw. 6.81. for it may be for the benefit of the Executor.
A man being Executor of his own wrong takes Administration, quaere how he shall be sued, Crooke 127. pl. 91. A. it seems as Administrator, for that is his best condition. It sufficeth to name them only that be Admi∣nistrators, Regist. orig. 140 A, & B. 19 Hen. 6.31. Coke 9. part. 37. Hensloes case, 33 Hen. 6.38. pl. 15. in the Writ and Count. Debt against an Executor, which pleads joynt executorship with another; they both may plead so, but the former only cannot, 29 Edw. 3.11. pl. 32. for they are but one Executor. Debt lies against an Executor of right and of his own wrong, 39 Hen. 6.45. pl. 19. for the lat∣ter hath made himself liable. But not against an Executor, and an Executor of an Executor, 41 Edw. 3.13. pl 3. for this would be to recover one thing twice. Two Executors, viz. a Man and a Woman, ad∣minister, and intermarry, debt lies against both, 22 Hen. 6.59. pl. 12. for the marriage drowns not the Executorship in the woman. The Heir ought to be named,Heir. 30 Hen. 6.5. pl. 2. in debt brought against him as heir, that it may be known in what capacity he is chargeable. But Regist. orig. 140. A. he was named Heir in the Count only, and not in the Writ, and yet good. Quaere tamen. He was named Heir apparent, and it was er∣ronious, Pasch. 35 Eliz. Ban. Regis 242. Audleys case; for he is not chargeable during the life of his Ancestor, for the Heir is bound, and not heir Apparent.
It shall be against him in the debet & detinet, and not in the detinet only, because he hath As∣sets in his own right, Coke 5. part. 36. Walkots case, Regist. orig. 140. A. Com. 441. A. Pepys case, by in∣tendment of Law, till the contrary appear. Debt a∣gainst the Ordinary, and the Writ. Praecipe A. Episcop. London ad cujus manus be∣na & catalla quae fuerunt B. qui obiit intestat.  dicitur, devenerunt, quod juste & sine, &c. reddat, &c. C. solidos, quos idem B. ei debuit, & praedict Episcop. ei injuste detinet, ut dicit, & nisi, &c. Re∣gist. orig. 141. A. Nat. br. 120. D. Et ibidem vide the Writ against an Executor of the Ordinary, who is liable, and not his Successor, for that might be inconvenient. But it lies not for the Ordinary, Nat. br. 120. D. Coke 9. part. 39. Hensloes case, for he hath no pro∣per interest in the estate; tamen vide, the Writ for the Ordinary in the Regist. orig. 141. A. Quaere, if it lie not, what remedy the Ordinary hath to recover the estate, and to punish the tort fesor. Nota,Nota. when a man demands money it shall be debet & detinet, Nat. br. 119. G. viz. where the Action lies in the debet & detinet. And if it be for any other thing it shall be in the detinet only, Nat. br. 119. G. Regist. orig. 139. B. 34 Hen. 6.12. pl. 23. for a man is not properly said to owe goods, but to detain them. And the Writ shall make mention of the va∣lue of the goods, 17 Edw. 3.48. pl. 17. 29 Edw. 3.39. pl. 14. & fol. 45. pl. 6. that the charge may be certain. And if it be for money, or other things toge∣ther with it, then it shall say 10 l.quas ei debet & injuste detinet, & 10 l. quarters of Corn, quae ei
injuste detinet, Nat. br. 152. B. 3 Hen. 4.13. pl. 20. 11 Hen. 6.48. pl. 6. 12 Hen. 6.1. pl. 3. vide 39 Hen. 6.34. pl. 46. debt for 300 l. A man cannot demand 10 l. by one Writ, and 10 l. by another, where the contract was for 20 l. 1 Hen. 5.6. B. but the charge thust be entire as the contract was, otherwise there will be unnecessary charge. For in Mich. 14 Jac. Ban. Regis, in the case of the Bailies of Ipswich Houghton Justice said, that A was indebted to the King in 3000 l. the King granted to B 1000 l. parcel of it, yet B shall not have debt for the 1000 l. as was adjudged in the Chequer, int. Yorke & Allen, for this were to alter the debt. A was bound in 6 l.Flemmish, quaere what Writ he shall have, 34 Hen 6.12. pl. 23. 29 Edw. 3.19. pl. 5. viz. for what sum, whether it shall be reduced into sterling money. For Lib. Intra. 158. C. sect. 1. the Writ was for 28 l. and the account of the bill was 19 l. 16 s.Flemmish, which is 14 l.English, and for the Remnant, &c. the Action brought. The Process in Debt, 1. Before appearance. 2. After appearance. At the Common Law the Process was but a Summons, Attachment, and Distress infinite, Coke 12. A. Harberts case. But by 25 Edw. 3. cap. 17. Capias was given, yet the Process is yet a Summons, Attachment, and Distress, 3. a Capias and an Exigend. 14 Hen. 6.20. A.
But if Debt be in the County per Justicies, and the Baily return a Nihil habet, and afterwards this is removed, quaere if a Capias lies, 3 Hen. 5.4. Nota,Nota. that a Capias lies not upon a Recogni∣zance, 23 Hen. 7.100. pl. 1. Crooke, for that is in the nature of a Judgment, upon which a mean Process lies not. Nor against a Peer of the Realm, Coke 6. part. 52. B. 11 Hen. 4.15. 3 Hen. 6.48. 29 Edw. 3.30. pl. 40. & 42. pl. 3. 5 Edw. 4.108. B. because he is intended to have Land sufficient to pay his debts. But if a Bishop of Wales or Ireland be sued upon a Nihil habet returned, a Capias lies, ibidem. Quaere of a Welsh Bishop. The Barr in Debt.Account. For arrea∣rages of account.Debt lies for Arrearages of Account, that he owes nothing is a good barr, Lib. Intr. 149. B. sell. 2. for this may be put in issue. 1. Before Auditors.And this may be by wager in Law, because it is within the Statute, 22 Hen. 6.35. pl. 53. 9 Hen. 5.3. pl. 9. 43 Edw. 1. pl. 3. 2. Before Auditors.And so if it be before an Auditor, Coke 10. part. 103. A. 4 Hen. 6.25. pl. 3. 20 Hen. 6.16. pl. 4. 13 Hen. 7.3. B. Conesby. If it be for Arrearages of account before Audi∣tors, imprisonment by Auditors is a good Bar; but then he ought to be committed forthwith by the Auditors, 27 Hen. 6.8. pl. 7. Coke 8. part. 119. B. Com. 17. for this is as it were the Execution against him. Non computavit a good barr, 3 Mariae Dyer 122. pl. 18. for if there were no Account, there can be no Arrearages found upon it, for which to bring the Action.
Nul tiel account, 34 Hen. 6.22. A. Danby, a good barr. Arbitrement for Arrearages of the account no barr, because one is matter of Record, but the Arbitrement is not, 3 Hen. 4.5. pl. 23. 4 Hen. 6.17. 6 Hen. 4.6. pl. 28. 8 Hen. 5.3. pl. 13. Hull, 3 Hen. 6.55. A. and so cannot discharge a matter of Re∣cord. Auditors discharged by the Plaintiff a good barr, Lib. Intra. 150. A. Sect. 9. in Account, for this destroys the account upon which the Action is brought. Obligation made to the Plaintiff for Arreara∣ges no barr, 11 Hen. 4.79. for an obligation is but a thing in Action. Q. Payment in another County a good barr, Lib. Intra. 150. A. sect. 10. for the place of payment is not material or traversable. That he owes nothing per patriam, a good barr, Lib. Intra. 150. A. sect. 1.4 Mariae Dyer 145. pl. 63. for this is a direct tender of an issue. That he owes nothing by the Law no barr, because Auditors are Judges of Record, 2. cap. 11. Coke 103. A. Denbounds case, 4 Hen. 6.17. 8 Hen. 6.5. 14 Hen. 19. pl. 21. 9 Hen. 5.3. pl. 9. and they have adjudged him to owe. But the Plaintiff may be examined by the Au∣ditors, and if it be not found that the Defendant is in Arrearages, the Defendant may wage his Law, per the Statute, 5 Hen. 4. cap. 8. Coke 10. part. 103. A. 8 Hen. 6.10 & 15. 19 Hen. 6.43. pl. 90. 20 Hen. 6.32. Ashton, for then he is not con∣cluded by the Auditors. And if the Plaintiff or his Attorney refuse to
be examined, the Defendant shall wage his Law, 33 Hen. 6.24. pl. 5. for then the Defendant may be believed as well as the Plaintiff. But if the Executor brings Debt for Arreara∣ges of account in vita testatoris, he shall not be ex∣amined; but his Attorney shall, but not upon Oath, 3 Hen. 6.40. pl. 2. 19 Hen. 6.8. 10 Hen. 6.20. 34 Hen. 6.32. Ashton, 20 Edw. 4.3. pl. 24. for the Executors shall not be intended to be privy to the contracts of the Testator. But 21 Hen. 6.4. pl. 10. the Executor was ex∣amined, but not precisely, which signifies little; for in generalibus non est certitudo. So if another brought such Action against an Executor, he shall not be examined, 20 Edw. 4.3. pl. 14. viz. the Plaintiff. So if it be found that they submit themselves to Arbitrement, so that they were not Auditors, but Arbitrators, they shall wage their Law, 22 Hen. 6.41. pl. 13. for Arbitrators are not Judges of Record. The Lord shall say that he owes nothing,Lord. and waged his Law, Westm. 2. cap. 11. doth not ex∣tend to the Lord, 14 Hen. 6.24. 22 Hen. 6.41. 38 Hen. 6. A. 29 Edw. 3.26. pl. 20. Coke 9. part. 87. A. Pinchons case. Q. The Defendant alledges before Auditors, that he delivered to the Plaintiff one Statute Mer∣chant in lieu of the sum, the Plaintiff wages his Law, 30 Edw. 3.4. pl. 19. upon the delivery. Quaere. Lending: to Prede∣cessor.Successor shall wage his Law upon a thing lent to his predecessor, 13 Edw. 4.4. pl. 9. because not privy to the contract.
To the party.That he owes nothing by the Law, a good barr, Lib. Intra. 152. C. sect. 5. although the thing lent be by others hands, 29 Edw. 3.26. pl. 24. for the Law wager is upon the receipt, and not the delivery. Debt upon bailment,Bailment. the Defendant pleads that they were delivered to be redelivered to B, the which he had done, a good barr, Nat. br. 138. M. for the trust was performed, and the contract thereby discharged. Contract Real, 1. for years. 2. for life. 3. at will.Arbitrement of Rent, Trespass, and payment of the thing awarded, a good barr without saying he owes nothing, 10 Hen. 7.4. pl. 4. Q. for thereby the agreement is waved. An Accord, a good plea, 10 Hen. 7.24. 2 Rich. 3. Debt 100. Coke 9. part. 97. A. Peytoes case, for the same reason. Acquittance of the last day shall discharge all Arrearages, 11 Hen. 4.24. 10 Eliz. Dyer 271. pl. 26. due before; for it shall be intended there was nothing due when the Acquittance was given. The Lessee pleads the command of the Lessor to repair the house with the rent, because it was decayed; this is no good plea, because it is waste, 34 Hen. 6.17. 14 Hen. 4.27. pl. 35. 11 Rich. 2. Barr, in the Lessee to suffer the house to decay, if he was not Lessee at will. But if the grand Timber be in decay, per∣chance it may be a good barr, ibidem; because Lessee at years is not bound to repair them, except he be tied by special Covenant, as it seems. Quaere. The Lessee was Advocate in the Spiritual Court, the Lessor promises that he shall keep
the Rent for his Fees, this is no barr, for step∣page is no plea, but he hath a good ground to have an Assumpsit to recover his fees, Mich. 9 Jac. Ban. Regis, Jarvis versus Lea, and here is no con∣sideration for the promise, for he was his Advo∣cate upon another ground. The Lessee pleads, that the Lessor entred before the day of payment, and ejected him, a good barr, 27 Hen. 6.10. pl. 6. 46 Edw. 3.1. pl. 1. Lib. Intra. 175. D. sect. 10, 11, 12. for then the Rent could not be due, for it was payable for the whole term, and cannot be apportioned, for it is entire. A good barr to say, that the Lessor entred be∣fore his day without any more, 34 Hen. 6.21. pl. 40. for the entry implies an ejectment; for both cannot be in possession. So if the Lessor enter but in part, a good barr, Coke 3. part. 22. B. Walkers case; for the Rent is payable for the whole thing lett, and is entire. But if the Lessee enter again before the day of payment, no barr; for then he regains the posses∣sion, and hath elected to wave this advantage of the entry made upon him. So if the Lessor cuts the Trees, no barr, be∣cause the Lessor ejects not the Lessee, 33 Eliz. but is only a Trespasser. Entry by a Stranger which hath a better title, a good barr, Perkins 163. Lib. Intra. 176. A. Sect. 13. 45 Edw 3.8. pl. 10. for that makes void the Lease. But not for Arrearages due before the entry, 9 Hen. 6.17. B. Cottesmore, 19 Hen 6.42. B. Paston, 20 Hen. 6.20. pl. 15. for so long the Lease conti∣nues in being.
Debt for Rent in com. M. where the Land is in com. E. levied by distress is a good plea, without saying more, 4 Hen. 6.5. pl. 12. 22 Hen. 6.31. pl. 19. 28 Hen. 6.6. pl. 2. Although the Lease be by In∣denture, 4 Hen. 6.5. pl. 12. 18 Hen. 6.17. A. per 2 Justices, 11 Hen. 7.4. pl. 16. for it shall be intended to be levied where the Land lies, which cannot be tried where the Action is brought. But if it be in the same County where the land is, then it ought to conclude that he owed nothing, because the Countrey may have notice whether he did or not, 28 Hen. 6.6. pl. 2. 33 Hen. 6.4. pl. 12. and may try the issue. But the 9 Edw. 3.33.4. pl. 16. Herle, it is good without such conclusion. Q. It seems, he thought levied by distress doth imply that he owes nothing. Debt upon a Lease for Tithes, levied by distress is no barr, because there is nothing subject to di∣stress, 22 Hen. 6.35. pl. 53. 11 Hen. 4.40. br. debt 234. and so the plea is impossible. A good barr that the Lessor distrained, and sold the distress for the Rent by the assent of the De∣fendant, 2 Rich. 2. Debt 235. for so he might do, but not without his consent. Payment in another County, a good barr with∣out saying more, 22 Hen. 6.36. pl. 1.34. Hen. 6.17. B. Moyle, 9 Hen. 5.2. pl. 6. 11 Hen. 7.4. pl. 16. 1 Hen. 5.6 & 7. 20 Hen. 6.16. B. 22 Hen. 6.35. pl. 53. for the payment is the substance, and the place it not traversable. For otherways it shall be tried where the Writ is brought, 4 Hen. 6.5. pl. 12. viz. if he plead payment generally, for that shall be intended to be where the Action is laid.
To say, that the Lessor covenanted to repair the house, or that the custome is that he should re∣pair it, and did not do it; this is no barr, because it is but a Covenant upon which the Defendant may take his remedy: but if the Lease be that the Lessee repaird it, and paid the rent for Re∣parations, this is a good barr, that the Lessor did not repair it, 27 Hen. 6.10. pl. 6. Q. But upon a lease by Indenture, and that the Lessee should repair the house at the cost of the Lessor, it is a good plea to say, that he did expend the Rent in repairing of the house, 2 Rich. 2.235. for this agrees with the Lease. That the Lease was upon a condition, and upon the breach of the condition the Lessor entred be∣fore there was any thing in arrear, no plea, for he ought to answer the debet, Crooke 153. pl. which he doth not by this plea, which is no more but a negative pregnans. Surrender before the day a good barr, Lib. Intr. 176. C. sect. 17. for thereby the Lease was drowned before the rent due. Contract personal.Accord a good plea, Coke 6. part. Blakes case, Lib. Intra. 205. C. Sect. 11. And so, that the Plain∣tiff had an obligation for the same duty, 3 Hen. 4.17. for this is such satisfaction as the Lessor ac∣cepted of in lieu of the payment of the Rent. Payment to the Servant no barr,Servant. unless the Ser∣vant was commanded by his Master to receive it, or that the money came to the use of his Master by his assent, Doct. & Stud. 138. A. for a Servant is not a Receiver without special warrant. Rent upon a personal thing.Upon a Lease for years of a stock of Cattel, or other personal thing rendring Rent at several days,
debt lies not till the days be incurred, Coke 3. part. 22. A. Walkers case; because the Rent is entire, though the days of payment be several. That he owes nothing by the Law a good barr, 1 Hen. 6.1. pl. 3. 9 Edw. 4.1. Salary for a Counsel∣lor.That he owes nothing a good barr, although the Plaintiff be a Serjeant at Law, 3 Hen. 6.33. pl. 26. 21 Hen. 6 4. pl. 6. who sues for his Fees; for such payments use to be private. The Defendant shall not wage his Law against an Attorney,Attorney. because the Court compels him to be Attorney for the party, and so no voluntary re∣tainer; otherways, if it be upon suit in a base count, 21 Hen. 6.4. pl. 5. Fortescue Newton; for there he is not bound to be his Attorney. That he departs his service within the term,Servant. a good barr, 40 Edw. 3.25. pl. 27. against a Servant that sues for wages; for the wages is due for the whole time. That he discharged him of the service within the term to which he agreed, is a good barr, 10 Hen. 6.23. pl. 78. for this discharge is accepted in satisfaction. That he retained him not modo, sorma, &c. a good barr, 38 Hen. 6.22. pl. 41. viz. according to the Statute. Payment without specialty is not a good barr in debt, brought by a Servant retained in husbandry, 40 Edw. 3.21. pl. 27. because he is retained by Sta∣tute. And so if one be retained, but not according to the Statute, the Master may wage his Law in debt for the salary, else not, Coke 9. part. 87 & 88. Pinchons case, 3 Hen. 6.42. pl. 13. 11 Hen. 6.48.
4 Hen. 6.19. B. 2 Hen. 4.14. 39 Hen. 6.18. pl. 24. 38 Hen. 6.22. B. for such retainer is but a private agreement, whereof the Law takes no notice. But he may not plead, that the Servant de∣mands 40 s.per annum, and the Statute allows not this, because he was not retained according to it, 11 Hen. 6.10. pl. 20. So if he be retained in all occupations, although that husbandry be comprehended within it; but he must be retained particularly in husbandry. If a general receiver retain one by deed, yet the Master may plead that he owes him nothing by the Law, 28 Hen. 8 Dyer 20. pl. 12.4. for he hath no authority to retain him. If one be retained in husbandry, although he be not compellable to serve, yet his Master shall not wage his Law, 38 Hen. 6.22. B. pl. 4. because the Retainer is by Statute. A retains B to be his Steward of his Court for one year or more,Steward. he shall have debt although the retainer be by word; but not for an Annual pen∣sion, unless the retainer be by deed, Crooke 1 Hen. 8.158. pl. 6. because that is of longer continuance, and therefore the contract ought to be more so∣lemn than by parol. Infancy no barr,abilng. 18 Edw. 4.3. A. Vavisor, 10 Hen. 6.14. A. Perkins 4. in debt for diet and necessa∣ries, because the Law makes such Contracts good. That he owes nothing by the Law, a good barr, 9 Edw. 4.1. B. 19 Hen. 6.10. pl. 25. 39 Hen. 6.18. pl. 24. Moyle & Danby, 27 Edw 3.87. pl. 37. for the payment may be private as well as the contract.
So if a contract for tabling be made with B. 22 Hen. 6.13. pl. 18. for a third person. So if an Inn-keeper brings debt for Diet or Lodging because they cannot depart till they pay for it, 39 Hen. 6.78. pl. 24. therefore it is rea∣son to wage their Law to gain their liberty, if the Debt be paid. But debt brought by the Lieutenant of the Tower for a prisoners diet, the Defendant shall not wage his Law, because the Lieutenant ought to find him ordinary Diet, Coke 9 part. 87. B. and therefore here shall be supposed a special contract which must be specially pleaded to. The Defendant said that it was in another place,Vendition viz. the sale upon which the action is brought, and that it was made upon condition, and that the condition was not performed; a good bar to the Action, 34 Hen. 6.6.42. pl. 13. 44 Edw. 3.28. pl. 6. vide 47 Edw. 3.20. pl. 44. because the condition not being performed, the sale was null and void. Debt upon a simple Contract, the Defendant pleads that the Plaintiff took an obligation for it, a good barr, Coke. 6. part. 45. Heggins. 3 Hen. 4.17. 11 Hen. 4.79. 9. Edw. 4.50, 51. For this amounts to a discharge of the Contract. Payment without an Acquittance no plea, 1 Hen. 5.6. B. in debt upon a specialty, because it must be discharged by a thing of as high a na∣ture. He cannot plead to the Country for part, and wage his Law for the other; but if it be for 20 s. that the Action is brought, the Defendant may say that the contract was for 10 s. without this
that it was for 20 s. and as to the 10 s. he wages his Law: but quaere if he may tender part, and wage his Law for the remnant, Crooke. 17 Hen. 7.40. pl. 12. It seems not, for there may be more due, and therefore it ought to be put in issue. In debt upon a sale that he owes nothing by the Law, a good bar, although the Defendant bought it of the servant of the Plaintiff; for the contract of the Servant is the contract of the Ma∣ster, 30 Edw. 3.19. pl. 27. If the Servant had authority to buy and sell, or that the thing bought came to the Masters use. Unless the Contract be by deed, 39 Hen. 6.35. pl. 46. Which must be avoided by Deed, and not by the Oath of the party. Debt against the Husband and Wife upon a contract of the wife dum sola fuit, the Husband wages his Law, as now he may, for now it is his debt; but if at the day of the doing of his Law, the Wife be not there, the Husband shall be condemned, 33 Hen. 6.43. pl. 23. For the debt originally was hers, and therefore she must join. That he recovered in an Action upon the Case, upon an Assumpsit, a good bar, Coke. 4. part. 94. B. Slades case. in debt upon a Contract; for it was in his election to bring his Action upon the Case. The breaking of the Prison by Enemies or a Tempest,Escape. a good bar, 33 Hen. 6.1. pl. 3. in debt against a Gaoler upon an escape; for he could not prevent it, nor can have satisfaction. But not by Rebels, 33 Hen. 6.1. pl. 3. For Rebels may be compelled to make the Gaoler sa∣tisfaction.
The Sheriff pleads that his predecessor suffer∣ed him at large, and that he did take him again, &c. a good br, 2 Edw. 6.67. pl. 17. in debt brought against him for an escape in his predeces∣sors time. Enfancy no plea, because the Statute is gene∣ral. Doct. & Stud. 147. B. In debt for necessaries vid. antea. Debt against a Bayliff, because the Sheriff had not made out his Warrant for apprehending one in execution, and yet returns that he was taken, and was not, quaere whether the Bayliff shall say no such Warant against the return of the Sheriff, 5 Edw. 4.1. It seems not, but must have his remedy against the Sheriff. Non permisit ire ad largum, a good bar, 10 Hen. 4.10. 38 Hen. 6.29. 3 Mariae, Dyer. 121. pl. 18. in debt brought upon an escape; for this is a direct tender of an issue that there was no escape. A Return by a Bayliff of a Liberty, that the Precept was not come to him at the time, and that afterwards he was not in the Liberty, 18 Edw. 3.35. is a good bar in debt against him. Taken again before the Action brought, a good bar, if that he agree not to the escape, and make fresh suit, Coke 3. part. 52. Rigwayes case. 34 Edw. 1. debt. 162. Otherwise not; for then he is particeps criminis. That he owes nothing, is no Plea, because this Action is brought, not upon a contract, but upon a special clause of the Statute, 2 Rich. 2. Issue 160. Which cannot be discharged by a plea parol, but he must answer to the Statute.
Account upon a recovery of dammages, and the party committed in execution, Nul tiel re∣cord, a good bar, 30 Hen. 6.6. For the Action is grounded upon the Record, and if there be no such Record, there can be no Action. Judgment in Court.Debt upon a Judgment in Pypowders, a good bar that he was taken in execution, 7 Hen. 6.18. upon the Judgment given in the Court of Py∣powders. Upon a recovery in a Court Baron, if an Acti∣on of debt be brought, the Defendant shall say that he owes nothing by the Law, 49 Edw. 3.3. A. Hanmer. 13 Hen. 7.3. B. Conesby. For such recoveries are of an inferior nature. Debt for dammagesDebt for Dammages recovered in Assize of the Plaintiff after Verdict, and before Judgment plead∣ed, quaere 2 Mariae, Dyer. 107. pl. 24. Levied by the Sheriff, a good bar, 11 Hen. 4.58. pl. 8. For that is satisfaction in Law, as to the party. Elegit pleaded in Bar good, 13 Eliz. Dyer. 299. pl. 34. For by the Elegit he hath elected his Execution. Upon a recovery of Dammages in ancient de∣mesne, debt is brought against the Defendant, he shall not say that he owes nothing, but shall plead Non tiel Recovery, quare 34 Hen. 6.49. A. pl. 15. Littleton. For it seems he may as well here as upon debt brought upon a recovery in a Court Baron. vide antea. For an Amerciament in a Leet, that he owes nothing,For fine, or amerci∣ment. by the Law no plea. 12 Rich. 2. Law 33. For a Court-Leet is the Kings Court, and not a base Court.
For an Amerciament in a Court-Baron, that he owes nothing, by the Law a good plea, 12 Rich. 2. Stathan, debt 35. No. Lib. intra. 119. A. sect. 1. vid. antea. In Debt upon a Statute Merchant with a defea∣sance, the Defendant said that he was a Lay-man, and not Learned, and that the condition should have been but to bind him to pay 40 l. and it was made 60 l. This is a good plea; for the Action is brought as upon an Obligation with a conditi∣on; but otherwise if execution be sued upon it as a Statute, Hil. 9. Jac. Banc. Regis. Fox versus Brooke. For then such plea comes too late; for the Statute is extended as a Judgment. Arbitrement is no Bar in debt for arrerages of account before Auditors,Arbitre∣ment. because the sum be∣ing due by matter of Record, ought to be answer∣ed by matter of as high a nature, 3 Hen. 4.5. pl. 23. 6. Hen. 4.6. pl. 28. 8 Hen. 5.3. pl. 13. Hll. 3 Hen. 6.55. A. quaere. 4 Hen. 6.17. pl. 3. 10 Hen. 7.4. A. which an Arbitrement is not. Debt upon an in simul computaverunt that he was not accountable by the Countrey, no bar; for where the Defendant may wage his Law, the Contract is not traversable, Crooke. 13 Hen. 7.39. pl. 4. For the Action supposeth that he as∣sented to the accompt, so that that is not to be put in issue. Nullum fecerunt arbitrium, a good Bar, be∣cause this lies in notice of the Countrey, Crooke. 13 Hen. 7.39. pl. 4. In action of debt upon a Bond, to perform an award. But if he plead such a plea, he cannot rejoyn
afterwards, and say that the Arbitrators gave no notice, but must plead it in Bar, and not by way of Rejoynder, Crooke. 7 Hen. 8.155. pl. 8. For such a Rejoynder confesses an Award, and the Bar denies it; so that the Bar and the Rejoynder cannot stand together. The Arbitrators gave no notice, no Bar un∣less the submission be so, viz. that the Arbitrators should give notice; for else the parties are to take notice at their peril. The Defendant said, that before the Arbitre∣ment made, he discharged the Arbitrators; this is a good Bar, 21 Hen. 6.30. 28 Hen. 6.6. Coke 8. part. 82. B. Ʋniors case, and needs not to a∣ver that the Arbitrators had notice; for they must be discharged without notice. Debt upon an Obligation, accord with satisfa∣ction is no Bar,Obligati∣on simple accord. because the duty being certain, ought to be avoided by matter of as high a na∣ture as it was created, which cannot be by pa∣rol. Coke 6. part. 44. A. Blakes case. But if the duty accrue not until some subse∣quent act be performed, there accord with satis∣faction a good plea, Coke 6. part. 44. A. For there the duty was not certain, but depended upon a matter ex postfacto. A. obliged to B. in 100 l. shews 3 Acquittan∣ces,Acquit∣tance. 1, of 10 l. 2, of 20 l. and 3, of 20 l. which amount to a receipt of 50 l. parcel of the 100 l. in which he was bound to pay 50 l. this is a good Bar, because it appears that it was but 50 l. prin∣cipal debt, for which the Bond was made, though the penalty was 100 l. 43 Edw. 3.31. pl. 26.
Foreign Attachment in London is a good Bar,Attach∣ment. as it seems, No. Lib. intra. 139. C. sect. 20. 22 Hen. 6.47. pl. 2. By the Custom there. Q. tamen. for it may be unduly attached, and no Judgment upon it. But a Legacy cannot be attached, because it may not be due in respect of payment of the Te∣stators debts, Mich. 14. Jac. Ban. Regis. Vaugh∣ans case. and so it is a thing uncertain. Attainder of Felony no plea,Attainder. Mich. 38 & 39. Eliz. com. Ban. Banister versus Trusselle. in debt, for the Attainder doth not discharge the debt. Nil debet.Nil debet in debt upon a Obligation is no plea, because an Obligation shall not be avoided by a nude Averment, but by matter of as high a nature, Doct. & Stud. 22. Non com∣pos mentis.Non compos mentis pleaded by the party, is no good Bar. Trin. 37. Eliz. ban. Regis. Strode ver∣sus Marshal. vide 5 Edw. 3.70. For the party shall not plead in his own disability. Payment without acquittance no plea,Payment. in debt without a specialty, 33 Hen. 8. Dyer. 51. pl. 10. Coke 5. part. 43. Doct. & Stud. 22. 20 Hen. 6.3. A. Paston. 26 Hen. 8. Dyer. 6. pl. 3. 28 Hen. 8. Dyer. 25. pl. 160. 41 Edw. 3.7. pl. 15. because it must be avoided by a matter of as high a na∣ture. A. by indenture sold Land for 20 l. and there were Covenants in the Deed; for the performing of which, he bound himself in 40 l. Debt was brought for the 40 l. Payment without Acquit∣tance is no plea, 26 Hen. 8. Dyer 6. pl. 3. & fol. 25. because the Action is grounded upon the Inden∣ture and the Bond.
A Defeazance upon a Statute-Merchant to pay 20 l. thereof without an Acquittance, is a good plea; for the Defeazance is instead of an Acquit∣tance, and this is without bringing an audita que∣rela, when the party is not in execution, 17 Edw. 3.3. pl. 10. For if he be in execution, there he must have an audita querela. Obligation condition∣al.A. is bound by obligation to pay his Rent, there payment without an Acquittance is a good bar, 46 Edw. 3.1. pl. 1. because the obligation was but conditional, and made no present duty. When the original contract is for money,Accord. an accord with satisfaction is a good bar, Coke. 9. part. 79. A. Petoyes case. 22 Edw. 4.25. A. For thereby the contract is discharged. But an accord made with a general receiver is no bar to his Master, if he had not a special autho∣rity, Doct. & Stud. 137. B. But when the condition of the agreement is for a collateral thing, there an accord is no bar, Coke 9. part. 79. A. 12 Hen. 4.23. 9 Hen. 7.4. 4 Hen. 8. Dyer. 1. For such a thing cannot be ac∣corded for. And if it be before the day of doing the thing, then part of the sum received is a good bar, Coke. 5. part. 117. Pinnels case. 27 Edw. 3.84. to the Action, because the Action is brought upon the whole Contract, part whereof was discharged be∣fore the time agreed on for performing it. But at the day, or after, it is no bar, unless it be in another place, Coke 5. part. 117. Pinnels case. Because then the whole duty was due upon the en∣tire contract; part received is a good bar in another Country, else the party shall be without remedy for so much as he paid.
The Defendant pleads, he paid so much in full satisfaction, the which the Plaintiff received, and not that he paid so much, the which the Plaintiff received in satisfaction, Coke 5. part. 117. A. Pin∣nels case, and good; for he must receive the mo∣ney as it was paid, and not as he will receive it. Conditi∣ons per∣formed.Conditions performed is a good barr, 41 Edw. 3. 10. pl. 7. & fol. 25. pl. 19. Thorpe, in an action of Debt upon a Bond for performance of Conditi∣ons. One pleads part of the Arbitrement,Arbitre∣ment. it shall be intended all that was arbitrated, until the con∣trary be shewed by the other party. 2. The o∣ther may shew the remnant, and traverse absque hoc, that they arbitrated that only as he pleaded it. 3. The other needs not to rejoyn to more, but joyn issue, because else it shall be a departure from his Plea, which must not be in pleading, Pasch. 12 Jac. Ban. Regis, Linsey versus Ashton. Condition to levy a Fine.Upon an Obligation with a Condition to levy a fine upon Garnishment, the Sheriff returns him garnished in debt, he pleads that he was not by the Law, 28 Edw. 3.100. pl. 42. 29 Edw 3.44. pl. 4. and good; because it is penal unto him, and the Bond is but conditional, and no present duty, and therefore the Sheriffs return shall not bind him. Deed poll.A enfeoffs B by Deed poll, provided that if he pay 20 l. to B he may re-enter, and is bound to perform all Covenants and Payments con∣tained in the Deed poll; he is not bound to pay the 20 l. for it is at his election to pay it or lose the Land, Trin. 9 Jac. Ban. Regis, Briscoe versus
Knight, Rott. 271. for if the Proviso be not per∣formed, the Feoffment is absolute, and the Bond is but to strengthen the Feoffment. A is bound to B to pay a sum granted by C by Indenture to B, and to levy it of his goods and Chattels, viz. of C; this is void, and therefore no barr in Debt brought by C, 41 Edw. 3.7. pl. 15. Belknap, 46 Edw. 3.18. pl. 17. Belknap. Quaere. A thing void in Law cannot be pleaded in barr. A Conditions that B shall lease to C the Land in his occupation,Condition except the Trees, this excepti∣on is not good, unless they were excepted in the Original Lease, and then B ought to shew it, Mich. 15 Jac. Ban. Regis, Dores case; for he letts him not the land in his occupation, if he had the Trees and excepted them. A Conditions that Lessee for life shall make a Lease for 10 years, and he makes one for ten years, if he live so long; this is good, for it was im∣plied before, Mich. 15 Jac. Ban. Regis, per Mon∣tague Chief Justice, Woolridge & Banbury; for such a Lease could be made but conditio∣nally. A Condition to deliver such a Lease as shall be devised by the Judge of the Court of Audience, Non devisavit aliquid, &c. is no barr, for he ought to procure him to make one at his peril, Coke 5. part. 23. B. Lambs case, the Pleading. No. Lib. Intr. 130. A. for the Condition is for the Obli∣gors benefit, and therefore he must do his best to see it performed. Impossible condition.A is obliged to B in 20 l. upon Condition to pay 10 l. to such a person, at such a place and
time as B should name in his Will, B makes his Will and names none, the Executors shall not have it, for the Condition is become impossible, for he ought to be named in deed, Trin. 12 Jac. Com. Ban. Pease & alii versus Mead, Mich. 11 Jac. Rott. 945. The Defendant said that he made another ob∣ligation to the Plaintiff, the which he did accept in satisfaction of the former; this is no barr, be∣cause it is but a thing in Action, Mich. 12 Jac. Com. Ban. Rand. & Strut. Trin. 6 Jac. Com Ban. Rott. 10001. Lovelace, and one thing in action cannot be discharged with another thing in action. Payment according to the Condition a good barr, Coke 8. part. 58. A. Beechers case;Payment. but he must shew the place where he made the payment, 9 Edw. 4.141. B. becauss it is material. Payment of parcel hanging the Writ, is not good to abate the Writ without an Acquittance, 3 Hen. 7.3. pl. 12. 5 Hen. 7.10. pl. 15. 7 Edw. 4.15. Vide 28 Hen. 8. Dyer 6. pl. 3. because the duty was by specialty. A is bound to B in 10 l. and after the date is a clause that he shall pay him 5 l. the Obligation is void as to the 10 l. payment there without Ac∣quittance is good, 30 Edw. 3.3. pl. 12. Q. be∣cause the Obligation is void. But payment after the day is not good without Acquittance, 46 Edw. 3.29. pl. 23. 47 Edw. 3.13. pl. 14. 5 Hen. 7.41. pl. 5. because then it is a duty vested. A is bound to pay 20 quarters of Maule, and if he pay it not at the day, then 40 quarters; in Debt for the 40 quarters he may plead payment
of the 20 quarters without Acquittance, because it is to save a penalty; but not in debt for the 20 quarters, 28 Hen. 8. Dyer 24. pl. 154. 1 Hen: 5.7. A. because that was the original duty. Three are bound to pay their Rent, one pays it, the other pleads payment without Acquittance, 45 Edw. 3.4. pl. 9. and good; for the payment of one is the payment of all, and he may not have an Acquittance. A is bound by an Obligation dated 17th of November, 12 Jac. with condition of payment the 19th November next ensuing, per Curiam pay∣ment 19th November 13 Jac. is sufficient, for it shall not be intended 19th November in the same month, Mich. 13 Jac. Com. Ban. Price & Coe; for it shall not be intended that an Obligation should be made for two days, and the next ensuing shall relate to the month and not the day. Conusee of a Statute had Execution for 20 l. and by Indenture grants, that if the Conusor pay 8 l. at a day to come, the Statute shall be void; this is a good discharge, 20 Assize pl. 7. Quaert, whether the Statute or the Execution shall be void. Payment to a Deputy a good barr, 42 Edw. 13. pl. 35 Q. what Deputy. Payment to the Baily of a Bishop without his command is a good barr, 22 Edw. 4.25. pl. 5. for it is payment to the Bishop. But payment to a Servant without command is no barr, unless it comes to the use of his Master, Doct. & Stud. 38. A. for a Servant as a Servant is no Receiver.
Payment to a Creditor of the Obligee by his command is a good barr, 46 Edw. 3.33. pl. 45. Perkins 145. A. for it is a payment to himself, be∣ing for his benefit. But then he ought to shew that the Creditor was the Creditor of the Obligee, 27 Hen. 6.6. pl. 1. viz. in his plea. In debt upon an Obligation with a Condition to pay 20 l. to B assoon as he comes to the Age of 21 years. 1. The Defendant ought to shew in performance of the Condition, that B is of full Age. 2. He ought to shew the place where he paid it, for otherwise there cannot be any tra∣verse, Mich. 12 Jac. Ban. Regis, Halse. Condition to permit one to enjoy,Permit. &c. he pleads that he did permit him, and good, 10 Eliz. Dyer 279. pl. 6. for that answers the Condition fully. The Defendant said that the Plaintiff was in∣debted to him,Retainer. and that he commanded him to retain it, a good barr, 22 Edw. 4.25.65. for such retainer is satisfaction in Law. Barr gene∣ral to an obligation. Acquit∣tance.Acquittance a good barr, from the party him∣self. But an Acquittance by a general Receiver with∣out receipt of the money by his Master, is not good, unless he be Receiver by deed, and hath authority to make Acquittances, Doct. & Stud. 137. B. for then his Master shall be estopped by the deed, to say he was not his Receiver. A brought debt in Ban. Regis against B, and that depending brought debt for the same debt in Lon∣don, and had goods attached in the hands of C, and had judgment upon them; this is a good
barr in debt, brought by B against C for the goods attached: but if A brings debt against B, and after the debt is attached in London, and Judg∣ment given there, if the Creditor sue B he cannot plead the Attachment in barr, because he might have pleaded it to the Action brought against him in Com. Ban. Mich. 39 & 40 Eliz. Com. Ban. Jaques versus Lewkner, in barr of the Action brought in London, and so have avoided the At∣tachment. A Debt is attachable before the day in which it is payable, because it is a duty, and the debtor debet, although non detinet; but an obligation made to perform Covenants is not attachable, Mich. 39 & 40 Eliz. Com. Ban. Beacher versus Mi∣nors; for this is incertain whether it may ever be∣come a duty. Coverture a good barr,Coverture. Lib. Intr. 168. B. sect. 1. in an Action of debt brought against a Feme Co∣vert, upon an obligation made during Cover∣ture. Infancy a good barr,Infancy. Lib. Intra. 163. A. sect. 1. for an Infant cannot be bound, nor contract to his prejudice. Non est factum.Non est factum a good barr, but not if the deed be inrolled, 16 Hen. 5. B. 9 Hen. 6.60. A. Ba∣bington, 39 Hen. 6.32. pl. 45. because the party hath acknowledged it to be his deed before the Judge or Master of the Chancery. When a deed is but voidable, non est factum no plea, Coke the 5. part. 119. A. Whelpsdales case, 11 Hen. 7.15. for non est factum is a plea to destroy the deed, and to make it absolutely void, and not ad libitum.
When an obligation is once good, and after and before the plea becomes void, non est factum may be pleaded, Coke 5. part. 119. A, B. Whelps∣dales case; for the Plea was true at the time of the pleading of it, which sufficeth to make the Plea good. When 3 are bound separatim, and the Seal of one is broken, the other cannot plead non est fa∣ctum, because they are several Obligations, Coke 5. part. A. Mathewsons case; otherwise it is where they are joyntly bound. But it is not so when 3 are bound without any more, Coke 11. part. 28. B. Pigots case; 3 Hen. 7.5. Coke 5. part. 23. A. for there they shall be in∣tended to be joyntly bound. But if two be bound in debt against one only it cannot be pleaded, Coke 5. part. 119. A. Whelps∣dales case; for it is the debt of both of them. A Recovery in an inferiour Court of Record with Execution a good barr,Recovery. Coke 6. part. 45. B. Higgins case; but not, if it be not in a Court of Record, or if there be no Execution. But without Execution not, Coke 6. part. 45. A. for that is all one as if there were no Recovery had, and so there is no satisfaction. A Recovery is a good barr so long as it is in force, viz. if it be in one of the Courts at West∣minster, Coke 3. part. 44 B. Higgins case. Release a good barr:Release. A Release destroys the du∣ty, and consequently the remedy to recover it. Two bound to B, who makes the wife of one of them his Executrix, and devises his goods to her; this is a good release of the debt, for the debt is part of his goods; for if the obligee make
the wife of the Obligor his Executrix; this is a Release in Law to the husband, because the Ob∣ligation is suspended pro tempore by the act of the party himself, Trin. 12 Jao. Com. Ban. Fryer versus Gildridg; for the wife cannot sue the husband to recover the debt. A Release of all advantages in account, a good barr in debt upon an account, 9 Edw. 4.49. Coke 8. part. 152. A. Althams case; for Arrearages are advantages arising upon the account. A is bound to B to the use of C, the release of C is a good barr, 36 Hen. 8. br. Obligation 27. because the Obligation was for the benefit of C, and so upon the matter he was bound to C. The Defendant said that the agreement was for the obtaining a Benefice;Simony. this is nought, 1. Be∣cause the Statute makes the contract void, because Simoniacal. 2. It cannot be averred out of it, being a matter dehors and not appearing, Mich. 40 & 41 Eliz. Com. Ban. Gregorie versus Olden. The Defendant pleads that the Obligee accept∣ed of a Statute for the Obligation after the day of payment;Statute. this is no barr, because the Obliga∣tion is in force notwithstanding the acceptance, for ought appears to the contrary, Coke 6. part. 44. B. Higgins case. The condition of a Counter-bond was to save the Surety harmless; it is no plea that the former Bond was usurious,Statute-Law. because the Counter-bond was not for payment of money, but to save harmless, Mich. 40 & 41 Eliz. Com. Ban. Dowman versus Button, and so it matters not to him upon what consideration the former Bond was entred into.
The Judgment in Debt. Against an Executor.The Judgment, Lib. intra 173. B. sect. 1. Arrerages of account, the Executor pleads no such account, or nothing in arrear or outlary in the Plaintiff, and it is found against him, the Judgment shall be de bonis Testatoris, 34 Hen. 6.22. A. Danby, and not de bonis propriis, for here is no devastavit. Q. A Covenant broken after the death of the Te∣stator, the Judgment shall be de bonis Testatoris, 15 Eliz. Dyer. 324. pl. 34. For the Covenant concerns him only as Executor. Nothing in Arrear in Debt for rent due in vita Testatoris, or no such Lease, the Judgment shall be de bonis Testatoris, 34 Hen. 6.22. A. Danby. For such pleas an Executor may plead. An Acquittance or a Release pleaded and found against him, if it be pleaded made to the Execu∣tor, the Judgment shall be general. 11 Hen. 6.8. A. Danby. 34 Hen. 6.24. A. Prisot. Quod re∣cuperet de bonis propriis. Non Assumpsit of the Testator to pay the debt, the Judgment is of costs and dammages of suit de bonis propriis, if the Testator had not sufficient. No. Lib. intra. 1. B. sect. 1. for putting the Plaintiff to a needless suit, which it is likely the Testator would not have done. The Executor found in a Chest a Grant of the next avoidance of an advowson made to the Te∣stator, and presentation thereupon in a Recove∣ly in a quare impedit, against him, the Judgment shall be of his proper Goods, 34 Hen. 6.22. B.
Prisot. For he shall not prejudice the Testators Estate by his own wrong. Co-executor pleads, and found against him, the Judgment shall be de bonis Testatoris, 9 Hen. 6.44. 11 Hen. 6.7. 34 Hen. 6.32. A. as well as where both are sued; for one Executor may answer if he please. Confession of the Action by the Execu∣tor, where he ought not to have done it, the Judgment shall be general against him, viz. de bonis propriis, because he ought to have pleaded that he had not more than 20 s. and against the other Executor it shall be de bonis Testatoris, 14 Hen. 4.12. pl. 1. Hull; for he is in no fault, and shall not therefore be punished for his compa∣nions ill pleading. And by 33 Hen. 6.2. it shall be of the goods of the Testator, if the Executor hath none for the dammages of the goods of the Executor that confesses the action; because the Plaintiff may otherwise lose his dammages. But 4 Eliz. Dyer. 210. pl. 23. it shall be but de bonis Testatoris in both cases, 28 Hen. 6.3. pl. 13. 40 Edw. 3.2.7. pl. 3. Q. Ergo. So in a rationabili parte bonorum upon con∣fession of one Executor, 28 Hen. 6.4. pl. 20. 33 Hen. 6.24. pl. 1. Ne unques Executor found against him shal be general, 11 Hen. 4.5. 11 Hen. 6.8. A. Danby. de bonis propriis for his false plea; for his falshood shall not prejudice the Testators Estate, if he can make satisfaction. But the Judgment shall be de bonis Testatoris,  &c. and if not de bonis propriis, 9 Hen. 7.15.
pl. 1. 2 Edw. 4.4. 33 Hen. 6.23. 11 Hen. 6.10. B. Q. One pleads ne unques Executor, the other plenè administravit, all but 40 s. and found against the former, and Judgment given that there should be recovered against both as much as there was in their hands, and the residue against the other, 11 Hen. 6.37. B. Paston. 46 Edw. 3.9. B. for his false plea, and it shall be intended that he hath as∣sets, else he would have pleaded so, and not a shifting plea. One dies intestate, and Administration is com∣mitted to D, by the Ordinary, and the Defen∣dant pleads that he comes as servant to D. to ad∣minister, absque hoc that he did administer in any other manner; this is no plea, because he did not shew that it was the Ordinary of the place, and Judgment de bonis Testatoris, 31 Hen. 6.13. pl. 5. as he ought, because it is traversable. This is an unskilful, and not a false plea, therefore the Judgment shall not be de bonis propriis. 17 Edw. 3.20. pl. 58. where one Executor pleaded non factum, and found against him, there the Judgment was against him of the goods of his own, as well as of the goods of the Testator, and against the other, of the goods that he had at the day of the Writ, vide 17 Edw. 3.20. pl. 1. stat. 9 Edw. 3. cap. 3. statute 1.17 Edw. 3.46. pl. 3. because by the Deed the Testators Estate is char∣geable, and by the false plea his own. In Plenè administravit pleaded, the Judgment was for so much of the principal debt as they had, and for the dammages de bonis Testatoris, si, &c. if there were sufficient, and if not, then for dam∣mages
de bonis propriis, and for the residue, as much as they had, Coke 8. part 134. Shipleys case. 34 Hen. 6.32. B. Prisot. com. 440. B. Pe∣pyes case. vide 17 Edw. 3.66. pl. 83. 46 Edw. 3.9. pl. 6. Judgment special for the debt. Upon such a plea of the Defendant the Plain∣tiff may pray execution forthwith, because it is a confession of the debt; but no execution shall issue, until the Defendant hath goods of the Te∣stators, Coke 8. part. Shipleys case. vide 21 Hen. 6.40. But if it be found for the Plantiff, no scire facias lies against them, 4 Hen. 6.4. pl. 8. Q. Unless he prays Judgment upon the plea. But yet 33 Hen. 6.24. pl. 1. is, That a scire facias lies; yet Coke 8. part 53. A. Syms his 04 case, that if it be for Land, he shall not have a scire facias, because there is no Record upon which it may be founded. Q. Against an heir.In debt, if the heir confess the Action for as much as did descend, then there shall be a spe∣cial Judgment against him of so much as did de∣scend, Com. 440. A. Pepyes. case. 22 Eliz.

Pepyes case for the whole, for his false plea. So if he confess the Action, and shew as much as descends, if it appear to the Court that the profits of the Land from the time of the descent, until the time of the execution, are sufficient for the debt, the Judgment shall be general, else not. per Dyer. 18 Eliz. Dyer. 344. pl. 1.
Execution in debt. 1. For the Plaintiff. 2. For the Defendant. 3. Of what Lands. 4. Of what Goods. At the Common Law it was but a fieri facias, Coke 3. part. 12. or a levari facias, Coke 3. part. 12. A. and this is of Chattels and Profits of Lands and Rents, com. 441. A. Pepyes case. And this only within the year; for if the year were past, the party was put to his action of debt upon the Indictment, Coke 3. part 12. A. Herberts case, unless the process be continued, 33 Hen. 6.49. pl. 33. For if it be continued, then is the cause still fresh before them, otherwise the Court will take no notice of it. But for a recovery against an heir, then it was but a Liberate of the Land, Com. 441. A. Pepyes case. Lib. Intra. 172. D. 173. A. 3 Edw. 3. Executi∣on, 107. For the heir is only bound in respect of the Lands descended to him. But by Westm. 2. cap. 45, a Scire facias was given after the year, and per Westm. 2. cap. 18. an Elegit was given, Coke 3. part. 12. A. If a man have an Elegit filed on Record, and there be a Nichil returned, he shall never have any other Execution, 19 Hen. 6.4. 5 Edw. 4.41. 15 Hen. 7.15. Fairfax. for it is the last and highest Execution; and the Court cannot de∣scend à majore ad minorem executionem. But if it be not filed, it is otherwise. And by the Stat. of 25 Edw. 3. cap. 17. a Ca∣pias was given in debt; and per consequence a Ca∣pias ad satisfaciendum in execution of a Judgment,
in debt, Coke 3. part. 12. A. Harberts case. Fo it is reason an Execution may be of as high a na∣ture as the mean process in the Action was, and  the same nature. Mich. 41 & 42 Eliz. com. Ban. if the Plaintif die after Execution, yet the Sheriff may levy  and if there be no Executor or Administrator, the Moneys shall remain in Court until Administra∣tion. Q. whether the Ordinary may not ha it. But if the Defendant die before Execution, there the Sheriff cannot make Execution;  the words of the Writ are, That it shall be levi∣ed of the Goods of the Defendant. Thoroughgu case. Q if it may not be against the Executor, because the Testators Goods in their hands may be said to be the Defendants Goods. Upon a non est inventus returned of the Prin∣cipal upon a Capias upon a Judgment in com. Ban. the party shall have Execution against the Ba, because the debt being by Original is certain;  it is mentioned particularly in the Writ, and there the Lands of the Bail, which they had  the day of the taking the recognizance, shall be liable, but quaere in ban. Regis, if more Lands a liable than they had the day of the Judgment, because the debt is uncertain, Mich. 15. Jac. Ban Regis, Baskervile & Brocket. special verdict. The Defendant for Dammages and Costs shall have the same execution as the Plantiff should have had, if he had recovered against the Defen¦dant, per 23 Hen. 8. cap. 15. Viz. Of the Lands which he had at the  of the Judgment, and not before, Coke 8. pa 171. Fleetwoods case. 42 Edw. 3.11. pl. 13. Edw. 193. pl. 14.
But if the Judgment be the last day of the Term, the Lands which he had the first day of the Term are liable, because all the Term is but one day in Law, 42 Assiz. 17. as to the Judg∣ment; for a Judgment given the last day is a Judgment of the first day. If two Joint-Tenants are for life, and one of them and against whom the Judgment is given, dies before execution, this shall not be put in exe∣cution, 13 Hen. 7.22. A. viz. against the other, because he was not party. Land in ancient demesne shall be put in executi∣on, Coke 5. part. 105. A. Aldens case. Hill. 11. Jac. Com. Ban. Rot. 2541. Cox & Barnesly. upon a Judgment in debt given at Westminster; for the judgment is well given. The Goods that he had at the time of the exe∣cution shall be only liable to execution, Coke part. 171. A. Fleetwoods case. 2. Hen. 4.14. 9 Hen. 6.58. 11 Hen. 4.7. 34 Hen. 6.23. B. Prisot. 21 Hen. 7.87. pl. 1. Crooke. Unless it be in case of Executors, 34 Hen. 6.23. B. Prisot. For they may have other goods of the Testator come to their hands afterward. But sale by covin after Judgment cannot hin∣der the execution, 22 Assiz. 72. 13 Hen 4.4. pl. 9. Q. if sale be made pending the Suit before Judgment by covin. Hill. 40. Eliz. Com. Ban. per Curiam, if a Writ of execution be awarded for debt or dam∣mages, and between the Test of the Writ and Execution, the party sold the goods bona fide, yet these are liable to the execution. Q. If so, where the Vendee knows not of the Judgment;
for it seems hard, and yet it seems as hard on the other side also. Ejectment. In what Court it lies. IT lies not in the Marshalsey, Coke. 10. part. 72. A. Marshalsey. For no Title for Land could be tried there. In Ban. Regis it lies. In Com. Ban. it lies. In the Exchequer it lies for a party priviledg∣ed, Coke 1. part. 3. A. Pelhams case; and this was by Bill. It seems it lies as well on the Pleas side, and more properly than by Bill. But if it be for ancient demesne-Land, it lies not in the Court of the King, Coke. 5. part. 105. A. Aldens case. 9. part. 77. B. but in the Court of the Mannor by their priviledge; but by consent it may be, as it seems, tried else∣where. Because the possession is to be removed in such action, per Hobart Chief Justice, Hill. 11. Jac. com. Ban. Rot. 25.41. Cox versus Barnibee. But none can plead this out ter-tenant of the Land in ancient demesne, because the possession doth only concern him, 2 Hen. 7.17. pl. 1.
But if the Plaintiff do not put in his declara∣tion until the end of the Term, the Defendant cannot plead ancient demesne the next Term, but must move the Court that the Plaintiff put in his declaration so late, and pray no advantage may be taken against him, and then the advantage shall be saved, Trin. 12. Jac. Ban. Regis. and he shall have liberty by rule of Court to plead ancient de∣mesne the next Term. But he may plead this after view, because by this he may confess if it be frank fee or not, 50 Edw. 3.9. pl. 20. Q. Who shall have an Ejectione firmae. Lessee for years only shall have it,Possession. Nat. br. 120. F. because this action is only to recover the present possession, and concerns not the Title, but ex obliquo, or collaterally. And this only upon the possession in deed; for he shall not have it upon a possession in Law, 23 Hen. 8. br. quia ejecit, infra, &c. 5. For that is not an actual possession, and so there is no pre∣sent disturbance. Nor upon a Lease to commence in futuro, 37 Hen. 6.18. A. For the same reason, and it may be it may never come in esse. Note that Tenant for years needs not count that he entred,Note. but that a Lease was made to him, by virtue of which he has possessed, com. 503. B. Grendons case. For the Word Possessed supposeth an Entry, or at least a taking of the Profits.
Tenant for years leases to B. at will, who is outed by a stranger, tenant for years shall not have an action, because he had not the actual possession, Pasch. 11 Jac. in the Exchequer inter Sir Richard Grebham & Stone. Q. if Tenant at will may for the feebleness of his estate; it seems he may. Tenant for years.Tenant for years leases for one year, or a Lease is made for years, the remainder for years, a stran∣ger enters, none shall have an ejectment but the Tenant in possession, Crooke 130. pl. 99. for none else is disturbed. Lessee shall have an ejectment after the term ended,Lessee. and recover all in dammages, 21 Edw. 4.30. pl. 25. Brian. 7 Edw. 4.6. B. Fairfax: For other remedy he hath not to recover them. Lessee which may have a real Action, cannot have an ejectione firmae, Com. 419. B. Bracebridges case. For real Actions are to be preferred before possessory and personal, because of a higher na∣ture, and thereby justice is more speedily done. Husband and wife.Husband and Wife ought to to join, if it be in right of the Wife, 21 Edw. 4.10. pl. 1.30. pl. 25. 7 Edw. 4.6. B. Fairfax. Com. 418. B. Bracebridges case. For the Husband cannot de∣clare of a Lease made to himself, though he be interessed in it by reason of the Marriage; and the Lease may come again to the Wife by his Death. But if the term be ended, the Husband alone shall have it, because nothing shall be recover∣ed but dammages, 7 Edw. 4.6. B. Fairfax. Which do only concern the Husband.
Lessee for one year of a Copy-holder shall have an ejection firm, Coke 4. part. 26, For he is a possessor for a term of years, be∣cause the time is certain, and of less term certain than for years the Law takes no no∣tice. Lessee of a Copy-hold for more years,Copy-hold. shall have an ejection firm, although that such Lease be a forfeiture, for it is a good Lease against all but the Lord, Trin. 36 Eliz. Ban. Regis. Downings case; and it may be the Lord will take no advantage of it. Executor of a Lessee shall have it,Executors No. Lib. intra. 195. D. sect. 6. because the possession is come to him, and he is damnified by the distur∣bance. Executor Plaintiff, Husband and Wife Co∣executors, Defendants, and the Count. Lib. in∣tra. 252. B. sect. 6. Executor shall have an ejection firm in vita Testatoris, per the equity of the Statute, 4 Edw. 3. cap. 6. Coke 9. part. 78. B. Peytoes case. else he should lose the term. Churchwardens shall have it of Land leased to them, 15 Hen. 7.8. in right of the Church,Church-wardens. for it is their possession pro tempore. Q. If new be elected before the trial, what shall be done. Tenant by Elegit.Tenant by Elegit shall not have an ejectione firmae, Crooke 109. pl. 29. For he hath no cer∣tain term; for the Owner may redeem the Land when he will.
Tenant in common.Tenant in Common shall have it against his Companion, Littleton. 73. A. For they have distinct interests in Law. Father and Son having several inheritances in divers Lands, the Father levies a Fine of it all, the Son being beyond sea at the time, dies, his Issue enters and leases it (being within Age) to A, without rendring any Rent, A. enters, the Conusee of the Fine enters, and leases it to B, yet B. shall not have an ejecti∣one firmae against A, if he be outed, with∣out express outing of A, because as to the moye∣ry the Plantiff had not title; for of that the Father might levie the Fine, and the Defen∣dant had none, because there was no Rent reser∣ved, and so had for the present nothing in the Land, Pasch. 32 Eliz. com. ban. Rot. 1017. Smye versus June, and others. Against whom Ejectment lies. Husband and wife.It lies against Husband and Wife, Lib. intra. 253. C. sect 11. Coke 9. part. 77. B. Petoyes case. Com. 187. Wortleyes case. Where the Husband outs one by colour of his Wifes Title. It lies against a stranger that wrongfully outs one,Estranger. 6 Rich. 2. Ejection. firm. 2. 21 Edw. 4.30. pl. 25. Brian. Nat. br. 220. F. Coke 9. part. 80. A. 32 Hen. 6.32.27. S. to gain the possession, and to recover dammages for the disturbance. It lies not against a Feoffee of a Lessor,Feoffee. be∣cause he cannot do wrong, Nat. br. 198. A. 21 Edw. 4.10. pl. 1. Choke. 21 Edw. 4.30. 32 Hen 6.32. pl. 27. 38 Edw. 3.33. pl. 44. For
he comes in lawfully as to the reversion. Unless the Feoffee make a Deed presently up∣on the outing, to pass the possession to another, then it lies against him, Nat. br. 198. A. Or if he enter upon the Lessee, afterwards that the Lessee had entred upon him, to regain his possession, Nat. br. 198. A. Lessor grants a Reversion to A, the Lessee at∣tornes,Grantor. A outs him, the Lessee shall have an eje∣ctione firmae, Nat. br. 221. A. 1 Hen. 5.3. pl. 3. For by the Attornment only the Rent and the Re∣version passed, and not the possession. It lies against the Heir of the Lessor,Heir. Nat. br. 198. K. if he out the Lessee, in case his Ance∣stor had power to lease. It lies against the Lessor that outs the Lessee,Lessor. Nat. br. 220.

For the Re∣covery shall not destroy the Lease, except the Les∣see be party to it. It lies against the Lord per Escheat,Lord. which outs one, Nat. br. 221. I. B. 198. K. For the Lessees Title was paraount the Lords. It lies against the Lord of a Villain which en∣ters upon the Termor, Nat. br. 221. C. 198.

It lies of a Garden,Gardon, &c. Barn and Tithes, 9 Eliz. Dyer. 258. pl. 16. together, for they are all per∣sonal things. But if all the Tithing consists of a modus de∣cimandi, and a Lease be made thereof, an ejectio∣ne firmae lies not, Coke 11. part. 25. B. Harpers case. For there is no possession of any thing lett but things which lie in prender. It lies of a Water-course,Water∣course. Com. 288. B. Brown. Regist. orig. 227. B. viz. of the soil where the water runs, or for the water to pass through. It lies of a Hundred,Hundred. because it is liberum te∣nementum, 15 Hen. 7.8. pl. 1. and so it may be lett for years. It lies of a Mannor,Mannor. and the Writ Regist. orig. 227. B. Nat. br. 220. G. Com. 229. A. Barkleyes case. which consists in demesnes and

For it shall be intend∣ed arable Land; terra dicitur à terendo, because broken up by the Plough. But it lies not of a Close containing three A∣cres, but shall be of so many of the Acres by name. Coke. 11. part. 55. Savels Case. to wit, 3 Acres called Crowlands, or the like; for the word Close is uncertain. For by Crooke Justice, Mich. 15 Jac. Wicks & Sparrow, the Land of every man is enclosed, and therefore an Ejectione firmae cannot lie of it for the uncertainty of the word Close. But Coke 11 part. 55. Savels Case was, it seems, that if it be of a Close containing three acres of Pasture, it is good; because the quantity is shew∣ed, and also the quality which makes it more certain, and so it was adjudged, Mich. 15. Jac. Banc. Regis. Q. tamen. For it may be more certain.
It lies not of a piece of ground called Michels piece, Trin. 38 Eliz. Ban. Regis, Rot. 450. Pal∣mer & Humphreys; for that is incertain both in the quantity and quality, and other Lands may be called of the same name, and so that makes no certainty in it. It lies not of a virge of Land, 38 Eliz. Rot. 453. Mell versus Moor, for that may be incertain, and may differ in respect of the place. The Count Generally. If it be of a Lease made by a Bishop,Bishop. it ought to count upon the Deed, No. Lib. Intr. 186. D. Sect. 2. and set it forth; because it is not an ordi∣nary Lease whereof the Law takes notice. But if it be of a Lease made by the husband and wife,Husband and wife. he needs not count that it was by In∣denture, Lib. Intra. 252. C. Sect. 8. Coke 2. part. 61. B. Wiscots case; but it sufficeth to say that they lett, and the Law will supply the rest. If it be of a Lease made by a Person tunc & aduc seized of the Reversion,Person. it is good without averring of the life of the person, 13 & 14 Eliz. Dyer 304. pl. 52. for the Lease is good whether he be alive or not. If the Account be of a Lease made by three, where two have nothing in it, it is not good, al∣though they all joyned in the Lease, for they could not all lett; but contrary, if he count by him only that hath right, per Williams & Crooke, Mich. 10 Jac. Ban. Regis, Longs case; for he did only in truth lett, though the others joyned.
A Lease to commence at Michaelmas next after the death of A,Lease. the Count ought to shew that A is dead, 1 Mariae Dyer 97. pl. 46. & fol. 89. 19 Eliz. Dyer 357. pl. 46. for else the Plaintiff shews no title, but shews matter against himself. The Plaintiff Counts that A demised to him per Indenture dated 27 Martii,Demise. 11 Jac. & pri∣mum delibat. 10. decimo Aprilis eodem anno, for 21 years from Michaelmas next before, and the Ejectment 12 Aprilis, this is good though the year be mistaken; or he may Count that by In∣denture dated 27 Martii, & primum delibat. 10 Aprilis, Mich. 11 Jac. Ban. Regis, Michels case, which is more plain and certain. The Count upon the Imparlance Roll was upon a Lease made 10. of December, 10 Jac. and up∣on the Plea-roll it was upon a Lease made 30 Ja∣nuarii, 10 Jac. babendum from the 20. of De∣comber before; this is not good, Hill. 14 Jac. Mil∣ward & Wats Ban. Regis, for it cannot be the same Lease upon which he counted, so there is no certainty in the pleading to which the Defen∣dant may answer. The Count was that J. S. was seized, and so seised, leased to the Plaintiff, 9 Eliz. Dyer 258. pl. 16. Com. 416. A. Bracebridges case, Com. 187. A. Adams case, Com. 223. B. Barkleys case, Com. 530. B. Howel & Crosts case; here is a good colour of a Title to his Lessor, and to his own Lease. But 14 Eliz. Dyer 340. pl. 57. he doth not count of the seisin, Coke 11. part. 3. B. Coke 3. part. 16. A. Borastons case, Coke 3. part. 45. Browns case, Coke 4. part. 96. A. Lamberts case, Com. 459. B. Studs case, Com. 504. B. Snowes case; but only
declares upon a Lease made unto him by the Les∣sr, and it seems good enough. The Writ. In Wales it may be by plaint without an origi∣nal Writ, for this action is out of the Statute, 26 Hen. 8. cap. 6. Hill. 36 Eliz. Ban. Regis 610. Griffin sus Eliot & Wilkins, and is there still as it was  the Common Law. It is Vi & armis, 1 Hen. 5.3. Coke 9. part. 78. 1. Petoes case, 21 Edw. 4. pl. 1. Choke, which al∣ys supposeth breach of the publick Peace. But Hill. 36 Eliz. Ban. Regis, Rott. 610. Griffin sus Eliot & Wilkins in Error, that it may be without Vi & armis, 7 Hen. 6.4. 17 Edw. 3.1. It ms it was so held, because the Defendant might er by colour of title to the Land. Fuit ad terminum qui nondum praeteriit, 2 & Marie, Dyer 116. pl. 71. but theres not the certainty of the time, for that is not material.

Non ejecit a good barr,Ejecit. si bona & catalla are not in the Writ, 7 Edw. 6.89. pl. 111. 19 Hen. 6.56 for that is a barr only as to the Land; for a man cannot be properly said to be ejected out of goods Quaere. But if such words be in, quaere whether it be good. It is a good barr,Entry. that the Lessor had it but in right of his wife, and he entered after the death of the Lessor in right of his wife, Lib.

Onerosum, a burthen to his conscience, if he present one not able. Quart, for he is not Judge of the Ability, but the Ordi∣nary.
In what Court it lies. Bracton Lib. 3. fol. 160. A. Immediate in uria Domini Regis terminari debent placita de advoca∣tionibus Ecclesiarum, quia si alius à Rege mandaret Episcopis de admittendo Clericum, & ipse non ob∣umperabit, alius à Rege corcionem non haberet, quia Episcopus ad alterius mandatum quàm Regis Clerieum admittere non tenetur; & per consequens  temporis Rex habebatur caput Ecclesiae, & Stat. de H. 8. factum fuit solummedo in affirmatione legit. Quare Impedit of an Advowson in Wales ought to be in Com. Ban. in England, and shall be tried  the County next adjoyning to Wales; and the reason is, because the Lords there have not power to send to the Bishop, 36 Hen. 6.33. B. Forteseue, 35 Hen. 6.30. pl. 35. 3 Edw. 3.163. pl. 35. 8 Edw: 3.319. pl. 15. 24 Edw. 3.3. pl. 26. for the King is Supream Head of the Church in all his Domini∣ons. No plea to the Jurisdiction to say, that it is Ancient demean, because they cannot in their Court award a Writ to the Bishop, 7 Hen. 6.35. for the former reason no Liberty or Franchise can be endowed with this high prerogative. In Ban. Regis it lies for the King, for he may sue there, if he pleases, Nat. br. 32. G. 47 Edw. 3.4. pl. 9. or in the Exchequer, as it seemeth. It seems also that it lies in Banco Regis for a com∣mon person. The King grants Majori Ballivis & juratis Quinque Portuum, that they shall not be implead∣ed;
for no Land in no Court, nor for other cause, unless it be within the Five Ports, scil. at Shep∣way, before the Warden of the Five Ports: this extends not to a Quare Impedit, 21 Hen. 7.88. pl. 7. Crooke, for that is intended for Temporal matters only. Who shall have a Quare Impedit. He that is out of the possession of the Advow∣son shall not have a Quare Impedit;Note. which a man may be five ways, 1. by Presentation, 2. by dis∣continuance of the Land, to which the Advowson was appendant, &c. 3. by Disseisin, 4. by De∣scent, 5. by Recovery in the Writ of Right of Advowsons or Quare Impedit. He that is out of possession of an Advowson cannot Present, and therefore cannot be hindred, and so the Writ can∣not lie; for a Writ must suggest the truth, else it is naught. Husband and Wife having an Advowson in jure uxoris, they shall joyn in a Quare Impedit, Coke 5. part. 57. Specots case, 50 Edw. 3.13. pl. 4. 7 Hen. 7.2. B. 38 Hen. 6.3. pl. 9. 28 Hen. 6.8. pl. 3. for the Wife is interested in the jus Patronatus notwithstanding her marriage. But the Husband may bring this without the Wife, 14 Hen. 4.12. pl. 12. 22 Rich. 2. br. 937. for the particular wrong done to the Husband in hindering him to present hac vice. The Church is void, the Wife dies, the Hus∣band shall have the Quare Impedit, because the Presentation was a Chattel vested in the Husband, 21 Hen. 6.56. because the Church became void du∣ring his wites life.
The Husband presents, and after they are di∣vorced, the Husband shall have the Writ, 31 Hen. 8. br. Divorce 8. if he be hindred in this pre∣sentation, for the Divorce shall not look back. Cestui que use shall not have it,Cestui que use. but the Feoffees of the Land; for the presentation is always firm to the Advowson which is in the Feoffees, Crooke 17 Hen. 7. A. Frowick & ibidem, 2 Hen. 8.160. B. pl. 1. Q. if the Statute of Uses alter not the Law in this point. The Lord Chancellor shall present to all Churches under 20 Marks per annum,Chancel∣lor. which are belonging to the Crown; but not if the King have them by other Title, Nat. br. 35. K. 38 Edw. 3.3. pl. 14. Com. 528. B. as by Purchase, Attain∣der, &c. But vide Br. Praescript. 86. that at this day the Chancellor presents to all under 20 l.per Annum. Twenty Marks anciently was more than 20 l. in succeeding times, and that may be the rea∣son. The Defendant shall have a Quare Impedit a∣gainst the Plaintiff, if his Clerk be not Instituted,Defendant Nat. br. 35. C. for without it he is not a perfect In∣cumbent. The elder Brother presents and dies,Half-blood the Bro∣ther by the half-blood shall not have the next A∣voidance, Nat. br. 36. E. 3 Hen. 7.5. because, as it seems, he shall not be inheritable of the Advow∣son. But the 19 Edw. 2. Quare Impedit 177. Con∣tra. Ergo quaere; for he may come in by the Fa∣ther or Grandfather, as Heir to them.
Two Sisters by several venters make compo∣sition for the Presenting, and one dies before Pre∣sentment, the other shall have it, Nat. br. 36. E. for the Agreement lasts but during their lives, and the Executor shall take no advantage of it. Corpora∣tion. Bishop. Ratione Patronatus.The Bishop shall have a Quare Impedit ratione Patronatus, if he be disturbed. Patronage of a Deanary belongs to him of com∣mon right, 17 Edw. 3.40. pl. 17. yet the King used of late times to bestow them. The Bishop shall have a Quare Impedit ratione Lapsus, for by the Lapse a Title to present accrues to him hac vice, and the Writ shall be general, but the Count shall be of the Collation, Nat. br. 33. D. 17 Edw. 3.64. pl. 69. Lib. Intra. 501. A. and shew how he is to present. If Lapse accrue to the Metropolitan, he may put his Clerk in without the Ordinary of the place, Doct. & Stud. 125. B. because he is supream Ordinary. Yet quaere in that case, whether he shall do it without the King, who is caput Ex∣clesiae. The Ordinary is deprived after Lapse accrues, quaere who shall have it, 7 Edw. 6. Dyer 87. pl. 203. it seems the King, or it may be the Metropoli∣tan, yet be an inferiour Ordinary. In quo casu Ordinarius loci providebit Ecclesie viduitati, Bracton, Lib. 2.34. fol. 76. B. But Bracion says, Lib. 3. that Lapse was but by the Council of Lateran, and before that the Pa∣tron might present at any time Ecclesia vacante. If it be sound for one Patron in a jure Patro∣natus, and the Presenter prays not to be admitted,
the Ordinary shall present by Lapse, 34 Hen. 6.12. pl. 22. for the Ordinary is to take care to have the Church provided in convenient time. Although a Ne admittas be sued, yet the Ordi∣nary of the place shall present by Lapse, Nat. br. 48. L. for he only looks upon the vacancy of the Church. Lapse is, when the Patron doth not present in six Months, then the Ordinary presents by Lapse, Doct. & Stud. 124. B. by the Council of Lateran; by Bracton. Although the Patron be an Infant or Feme covert, Nat. br. 34. T. 3 Edw 3. Quare Impedit 41. for the Law takes care of the infancy of the Church above all other infancy, in respect of the Cure of Souls. But this rule of Lapse admits divers exceptions, Scil. 1. So long as the Church is void the Patron may present, Doct. & Stud. 126. A. for the Title by Lapse is not a Chattel vested in the Ordinary, though after six months, if the Ordinary have not presented. 2. It shall not be a Lapse of a Chappel Dona∣tive or Chantry, unless the Patron make it pre∣sentative, and then it shall, for then the nature is altered, Nat. br. 35 E. 6 Hen. 7. br. Presentment 43. Pasch. 3 Jac. Ban. Regis, Fairefield versus Gaire, or be so expressed in the foundation, 13 Edw. 4.3. 3. An Advowson approprlate shall not be Lapsed, Nat. br. 35 F. for there the Church shall be intended to be otherwise provided for, and not by presentation.
4. If the Ordinary be named a Disturber in the Quare Impedit, 5 Edw 3.2. B. 22 Hen. 6.28. And at this day he is named in the Writ to prevent the Lapse, 39 Edw. 3.15. pl. 4. Sta∣tham. For otherways the Lapse incurrs, 5 Edw. 4.115. for then he can take no notice of the Suit; but it seems that the Ordinary cannot collate him that was the Incumbent, and made Defendant in the suit; for this would be to prevent the trial of the Right. 5. In many cases Lapse shall not incurr with∣out notice, viz. where the Patron cannot take notice of the Avoidance of the Church. As, In what case Lapse cannot in∣curr with∣out notice.1. Upon a Resignation, Nat. br. 35. H. 1 Hen. 7 9. 5 Edw. 4.116. A. for this is a private act. If the Ordinary dies his Successor ought to give notice, Crooke 18 Hen. 7.41. pl. 2. Quaere of what; it seems of the Churches being void. 2. Upon privation, Nat. br. 35. H. 1 Hen. 7.9. 5 Edw. 4.118. A. for this is also a private act, which the Patron is not bound to take notice of without notice. Although the Incumbent be meerly Laicus, 13 Eliz. Dyer 293. pl. 3. Q. And although the party be party to the Suit, Coke 6. part. 29. Greens case, 22 Eliz. Dyer 369. pl. 54. And although the Title of Lapse be devolved to the King, per Lapsum temporis, 18 Eliz. Dyer 348. pl. 12. 22 Eliz. Dyer 369. pl. 54. 3. If it be Litigious, 34 Hen. 6.40. B. Prisot. Lib. Intra. 511. D. whether the Church be void or not.
4. If the Church be void by any clause of the Statute, 13 Eliz. cap. 12. for such Statute it seems is not a general Law. Quaere tamen, for it seems Patrons ought to take notice of it. 5. Where he shall lose his Benefice, per 2 Edw. 6. cap. 20. for refusing to pay Tithes, 12 Eliz. Dyer 294. pl. 3. for of such a misdemeanour the Patron is not bound to take notice, for it shall not be presumed the Incumbent will commit such an offence. 6. If one have a Benefice within 8 l.per ann. and takes another, and be Inducted, Coke 4. part. 79. and so forfeit the former. 7. If the former be of 8 l. without Induction, no Lapse without notice, Coke 4. part. 79. B. Dig∣bies case. But after Induction no notice is requisite, Coke 4. part. 75. 7 Eliz. Dyer 237. pl. 29. 8 Eliz. Dyer 255. pl. 5. for that is a notorious act, whereof the Patron may take notice. And the value of the Living shall be according to the true value, and not according to the Book of Tithes and First-Fruits, 7 Eliz. Dyer 237. pl. 29. which is at an undervalue. 8. Upon refusal of a Clerk to be admitted, Nat. br. 35. I. 15 Eliz. Dyer 327. pl. 7. for of this the Patron cannot take notice, nor shall he presume it. But Crooke 18. Hen. 7.49. pl. 2. per Frowick, if it be a Spiritual Patron, then it is not requisite to give notice, because he is presumed better know∣ing in such matters than a Lay-Patron. So for Avoidance per Creation of the Incum∣bent to be a Bishop, Cession, or Death, Doct.
& Stud. 116. B. 5 Edw. 4.115. Quaere of Death. After privation the Patron grants the Advow∣son to A, the Ordinary collates A; he cannot be removed, for notice ought not to be given him, for it was void to all but the Grantor; for the Ordinary is not bound to take notice of the Grant to A, because it is a private act, Mich. 42 & 43 Eliz. Com. Ban. Rot. 3579. Leake against the Bishop of Coventry. Notice is to be given as to the Lapse only, for as to the presentation, the Patron may be put out of the possession of the presentation for some o∣ther cause, although no notice is given him, Pasch. 39 Eliz. Com. Ban. Scriven versus Episcopum Lincoln. A Parson shall have a Quare Impedit for the Vicarage,Parson. for of common right it belongs unto him to present, Nat. br. 33. Ʋ. For if the Vicarage be void, and the Parson be made a Bishop, yet he shall present, for it was a Chattel vested in him whilst he was Parson, Nat. br. 34. N. 24 Edw. 3.26. Q. A Parson Imparsonee or Incumbent, shall have a Quare Impedit, 17 Edw. 3.51. pl. 25. for the Vicarage. For a Prebendary,Prebenda∣ry. although the Prebend resign after usurpation upon him, 26 Edw. 3.3. Q. Dean and Chapter.The Chapter brought a Quare Impedit against the Dean, and good; for their possessions are se∣veral, though they be one body Politick, 9 Edw. 3.134. & fol. 354. pl. 33. 17 Edw. 3.64. 40 Edw. 3.28. B. Finchden, 7 Edw. 3. Quare Impedit 72. Lab. Intra. 500. A.
An Hospital which hath no Spiritual possessi∣ons,Aggregate nether are a Colledge, nor have a Seal, yet the Master shall have a Quare Impedit. Corpora∣tion mixt.For a Corporation mixt, as in case of the King, 1. In right of the Crown, Nat. br. 32. E. the Writ. 2. By reason of Lapse incurred, for this makes him Supream Patron, Doct. & Stud. 124. B. Com. 498. 18 Edw. 3.19. Therefore after Lapse accured to the King, the Patron cannot present, Doct. & Stud. 126. A. 10 Eliz. Dyer 277. pl. 55. for the Kings Title shall be preserved and preferred above all other Ti∣tles. Nor the Ordinary collate after Lapse is accrued to the King, 17 Eliz. Dyer. 339 pl. 47. for the same reason. In his own right.But in case, where notice is requisite, the King cannot present without notice, 18 Eliz. Dyer 348. pl. 12. 22 Eliz. Dyer 369. pl. 54. for the King shall not take advantage against one, where there was no negligence in the party. If the Dean of the Chappel Royal presents not within six months, the King shall present, Nat. br. 34. F. 27 Edw. 3.84. Chappel-Royal is the Kings Chappel, or of his foundation, and he is instead of the Ordinary. A Parson created is a Bishop,Creation. the King shall present, 21 Edw. 3.31. pl. 14. & fol. 41. 11 Hen. 4.37. vide 6 Eliz. Dyer 228. for the Pa∣tron could not have presented till the death of the Parson, and so here is but putting in one person for another, and so he hath no injury.
Ratione temporali∣um.21 Edw. 3.5. pl. 13. the Writ was, quia per∣tinet ad Regem praesentare ratione. Episcopatus nuper vacantis, and good, when a Living fell, which be∣longed to a Bishoprick, sede vacante. The Count, Lib. Intra. 530. C. sect. 15. And the King needs not say in the Count, for that the Temporalties were seized, 42 Edw. 3.7. pl. 27. for that shall be supposed; for by the death of the Bishop the Temporalties are imme∣diately in the Kings hands. If a Church be void during the time that the Temporalties are in the hands of the King, al∣though he makes restitution of the Temporalties, yet the King shall present, Nat. br. 33. N. Stanford 44 Edw. 3.17. pl. 8. 18 Edw. 3.22. pl. 39. for it was vested in the King by the vacancy, whilst the Temporalties were in his hand. If the Church become void, and the Bishop dies, the King shall have it, and not the Execu∣tors, Nat. br. 33. Q. 9 Edw. 3.2. Quare Impedit 11. because the King is now Patron, and finds the Church empty. And although the Bishop collate, Nat. br. 34. K. 11 Hen. 4 9. A. 24 Edw. 3.30. 44 Edw. 3.3. for that makes not the party collated to be Incum∣bent, but his Induction. But if he die after Induction, although it be the same day, the King shall not have it, 44 Edw, 3.3. for then the Church was full. If a Lapse accrues to the Bishop, who dies, the King shall present, 25 Edw. 3.53. pl. 20. for he is in place of the Bishop. It a Lapse accrues after the death of the Bi∣shop, the King shall present, Nat. br. 34. G.
in respect of the Temporalties in his hands. So if he have judgment to have the Tempo∣ralties,Outlawry. 21 Edw. 3.29. for that is all one as if he were in possession of them. By Outlawry, of, the Patron in a personal Acti∣on, the King shall present, Nat. br. 34. R. 8 Rich. 2. Quare Impedit 200. 21 Hen. 6.56. if the Church become void during the Outlawry. Quaere, if afterwards the Outlawry, be reversed before the King presents. A enfeoffs. B of a Mannor, to which, &c. and before was outlawed, and presents per permission of B, the King shall present, because the presen∣tation is a Chattel, 5 Hen. 5. pl. 4. and was for∣feited to the King by the Outlawry. For Simony, upon 31 Eliz. cap. 6. The Pleadings, No. Lib. Intr. 405. C. sect. 516. B. 531. D. Note per 25 Edw. 3. cap. 1. the King shall not present in anothers right,Note. but for the Avoidance in his own time, 11 Hen. 4.7. pl. 16. which is in his own right. Note, if the King presents one that dies before Induction, the King shall present again, for he had not a compleat presentation before, Coke 9. part. Holts case, vide Regist. orig. 31. B. for his Clerk was never in. But if the King have title hac vice, and another presents A, which dies, the King hath lost his turn, Coke 7. part. 28. Baskerviles case, No. Lib. Intra. 489. A. for he was to have but this nume∣rical presentation, and is not like the having of the next presentation.
Yet if one qualified to have two Benefices takes another incompatible, the first is void by two years; the Patron presents where the King ought to have presented, and after Induction his Clerk refuses to pay his Tenths, and this is cer∣tified according to the Statute of 26 H. 8. the Bi∣shop being Patron collates, the King shall present notwithstanding, for this refusal is as it were a Resignation to the Bishop, which shall be intended a Collusion betwixt him and the Bishop, to take away the Title of the King, Mich. 29 & 30 Eliz: Com. Ban. Rot. 22 99. the King against the Bishop of Lincoln. 12 Eliz. Dyer 292. pl. 70. 25 Edw. 47. the King presents to a Prebendary ratione tempora∣lium, and revokes it before the Installment of the Prebend; and yet he is Inducted, and the King confirms it, and after he is made a Bishop, the Prebend dies, the King shall present again, and not the Bishop, for the confirmation of the King was void, because the Prebend was not in ex prae∣sentatione Regis, for that was revoked before the Confirmation. Nat. br. 38. D. the King recovers a Prebendary, and gives it by Letters Patents to A, who dies, the King gives it to B, he shall have Writ to the Justices to make execution for him, viz. of th Court where the Prebendary was recovered. Disseisee shall have a Quare Impedit before his entry into the Mannor,Disseisee. to which the Advowson belongs, 21 Hen. 6.9. B. 19 Hen. 6.33. 33 Hen. 6.33. B. Nat. br. 33. Q. 24 Hen. 8. Dyer 5. pl. 6. Crooke 6 Hen. 8.169. A. Pollard; for the Advow∣son was not divested by the disseisin.
Disseisor presents, Disseisee enters into the Man∣nor to which, &c. and presents, he shall have a Quare Impedit, if it be within six months, 14 Hen. 6.24. Fulthorp; for by his entry he hath regained the Mannor, and avoided the Disseisors presentation. Add if the Disseisor presents, and the Disseisee enters into the Mannor, to which, &c. and en∣feoffs B thereof, with the Advowson, the Church voids, B shall have a Quare Impedit; for by the entry of the Disseisee he was in the possession of the Advowson, 3 Hen. 4 7. pl. 33. 14 Hen. 6.16. pl. 52. and so it passed with the Mannor by the Feoffment. But 33 Hen. 6.33. Prisot to the contrary; for there it is said, that until Recovery the Disseisee shall not have the Advowson. Q. Disseisor dies seized of a Mannor to which the Advowson belongs, the Disseisee shall not have a Quare Impedit, 24 Hen. 8. Dyer 5. pl. 6. 33 Hen. 6.33. B. vide 19 Hen. 6.33. in respect of the de∣scent, which takes away his entry into the Man∣nor, and so he must recover the Mannor before he can have the Advowson. But if it void in the time of the Disseisor, the Disseisee shall have it, although the Disseisor died seized afterwards of the Mannor, to which, &c. 24 Hen. 8. Dyer 5. pl. 6. for there was no descent barr when the Church became void, and so it was a Chattel vested. A Disseisor suffers a Usurpation, Disseisee en∣ters into the Mannor, Disseisee shall have a Quare Impedit, Nat. br. 36. F. 14 Hen. 6.14. 3 Hen. 4.7. for the usurpation is defeated by the entry of the Disseisee.
Executor of the King shall not have a Quare Impedit,Executor. but the Successor of the King, for this is a Chattel Royal, 7 Hen. 4.25. pl. 3. 1 Edw. 3.17. pl. 8. 5 Edw. 3.149. pl. 15. which shall not go to an Executor, for it is vested in the Crown. Executor of a Common person shall have a presentment to a Church, which was void in the time of the Testator, although the Testator were but Tenant in tail, Nat. br. 33. P, & Ʋ. because it was a Chattel vested in the Testator. Although the Heir be in ward to the King, Nat br. 33. R. for the King in respect of the Wardship shall not be in a better condition, than the Heir should have been, if he had been at full age at the death of his Ancestor. If one recover in a Quare Impedit and die, the Heir shall not have execution, but the Executors, 9 Hen. 6.57. A. Rolfe; for the recovery made it a Chattel vested in the Testator. At the Common Law the Infant was bound by suffering an Usurpation,Enfant. 35 Hen. 6.6. that is, to suffer one to present in his stead, 31 Edw. 3. Quare Impedit 186. 10 Edw. 2. Quare Impedit 43. for the Common Law respects the Churches good, before Infants, Widows, or Orphans, although it be tender of all. But at this day he is not, per Westm. 2. cap. 5. The Law before seemed too hard against Infants, who may be presumed not conusant of the Law, and ignorant of his title. Unless he be a Purchaser, 10 Edw. 2. Qu. Imped. 43. 35 Hen. 6.60. Nat. br. 31, & 34. It seems he is not within the Statute: He may, if a Purchaser,
be presumed not so well conusant of his title as if he had it by descent. Or that the party that usurps be remitted to an eigne title, Nat. br. 35. M. for then the presenta∣tion did not belong to the Infant. If he suffer Usurpation, having it by descent, he is bound till full age, 16 Edw. 3.9. Quare Im∣pedit 62. for he shall be judged better conusant of such estate than of a purchased estate; and he might have presented himself. And if in his minority he suffer Usurpation, and at full age enfeoff B of the Mannor, to which, &c. yet B shall not be in, Nat. br. 34. X. because it was out of the Feoffor at the time of the Feoff∣ment, and so it passeth not. But by 16 Edw. 3. Quare Impedit 67. Coke 6. part. Boswels case, the Infant is also bound in all these cases. Q. Feme Covert.The Usurpation at the Common Law shall bind a Woman Covert, 35 Hen. 6.6. Prisot, 31 Edw. 3. Quare Impedit 180. 10 Edw. 2. Quare Imped. 43. vid. antea. The husband suffers an Usurpation, where the Woman is the purchaser, she shall not have a Quare Impedit, but the husband; but if she had it by descent, she shall have the next turn, per Westm. 2. cap. 5. Nat. br. 34 S. to present. The husband discontinues one Acre of his wives Mannor, to which an Advowson is appen∣dant with the Advowson, the wife may not pre∣sent, unless after the Alience sever the Advowson from the Acre, Nat. br. 32. 17 Edw. 3.5. pl. 12. for then the Advowson is not appendant to any thing.
Feoffee or Grantee, 1. of the King; 2. of another.The King grants the Advowson in Fee, the Church being void, the Grantee presents, Nat. br. 33. N. for the grant shall be taken most benefici∣ally for the Grantee. But this is intended when the King hath but one Title to the Advowson, 10 Eliz. Dyer 269. pl. 19. 9 Edw. 3.26. Stamford. Praerogat. 44. 16 Hen. 7.7. 18 Edw. 3.22. A. Pole. for if he have two, the Grant shall not be taken to two in∣tents. For if he had two Titles the Grantee shall not present, 13 Eliz. Dyer 300. pl. 36. 18 Eliz. Dyer 300. pl. 36 Eliz. Dyer 348. pl. 12. for it is in∣certain which Title was granted, nor can be known with what Title he presents. But 9 Edw. 3.348. pl. 24. the orders of the Templers were dissolved, the Church belonging to them to present to voids, and after the Ad∣vowsons, &c. appendant to their mannors, were given to the Hospitallers per Parliament; the King shall not have the presentation, for here the King had but one Title, and also acts of grace shall be construed largely against the King. A Common person grants the Advowson in Fee when the Church was void, the Grantee shall not have the presentation, because it is a thing in action, 11 Hen. 4.54. which lies not in grant, but may pass by Act of Parliament. So of a Feoffment of Land, to which an Ad∣vowson is appendant, 24 Eliz. Staffords case, the Church being void at the time of making of the Feoffment. But if the Feoffment be upon condition, and the Church becomes void, and afterwards the
Feoffor enters for the Condition broken, the Feoffee shall present, because it is a Chattel vested in him, 24 Edw. 3. before the entry of the Feoffor. If there be a Feoffment of the third part of a Mannor, the Feoffee shall not have the third pre∣sentment, 6 Edw. 3.215. A. for the Advowson is not appendant to it, for it cannot be appendant by parcels. Unless it be with three presentments, 9 Edw. 3.341. pl. 31. viz. where three present to the Ad∣vowson by turn. Q. Grantee of the next Avoidance shall have a Quare Impedit, 39 Hen. 6. Quare Imp. 95. for he hath a good Title to present hac vice. The Count, Lib. Intra. 520. D. And if the Grantee of a Mannor to which an Advowson is appendant, levies a Fine of the Advowson, yet this puts him not out of possession of the Advowson, 19 Edw. 3. Quare Imped. 154. because it puts him not out of possession of the Mannor to which it appertains. Grantee by Parliament suffers a usurpation; this doth not put him out of possession, 16 Hen. 7.8. Keble, because he is in by Title of so high a nature, which shall not be intercepted by an ordi∣nary act of the party. Grantor by Fine usurps; this shall not trouble the Grantee, 31 Edw. 1. Quare Impedit 187. for a Fine is of a high nature, and barrs the Conusor of all right. Tenant in tail for life, or years, grants their E∣state in an Advowson, the Church voids, the Gran∣tee shall present, because it is a Chattel vested, 9 Edw 3.366. pl. 4. in the Grantee during the estate tail, and for life.
If the Daughter suffers a Usurpation,Daughter. the So afterwards born shall not have a Quare Impedit 11 Edw. 3. Quare Impedit 138. for he was not  rerum natura at the time of the usurpation, and  had no right. A Founder of a Church shall have a Quare Im∣pedit of common right,Founder. for he is presumed Pa∣tron, and because he enters upon the dissolution 12 Edw. 4.30. A. Catesby. Q. One of them,Joynt∣tenants. viz. Joyntenants, shall not have a Quare Impedit against the other, Nat. br. 34. Ʋ. 14 Eliz. Dyer 304. pl. 54. 33 Hen. 6.11. B. in re∣spect of their undivided and undistinguishable in∣terest. Nor against a Stranger; but they must joyn, or else the Disturber might be twice sued for one disturbance. But where one pleads Joyntenancy of part of the Advowson, the Plaintiff ought to entitle himself to the whole Advowson, or shew that he is Incumbent of all, 31 Hen. 6.51. B. Joyntenancy of part is no Plea, 14 Hen. 6.14. 14 Hen. 4. Joyntenants 32. for it cannot be; for Joyntenants are seised per my & per tout. Joyntenant presents sole; this shall not put his Companion out of possession, 27 Hen. 8.13. for it shall be intended, he intended it not but to pre∣sent so, as the Law requires. But 11 Hen. 4.44. Hanford e contra. Ergo quaere. If they make composition, and present accord∣ingly, yet afterwards, if one be disturbed, he shall not have an Action without his Companion, 20 Edw. 3.72. for that composition concerns not Strangers, but is only a private act betwixt them∣selves.
Nomina∣tor to a Living.Nominator to a Living shall have a Quare Im∣pedit against him that presents, Nat. br. 33. A. be∣cause by the Nomination he had the fruit of the Advowson, 14 Hen. 4.11. pl. 9. 14 Edw. 4.2. pl. 2. 32 Hen. 8. Dyer 48. pl. 16. 22 Edw. 3.77. pl. 103. 24 Edw. 3.69. pl. 78. And the Writ shall be general, Nat. br. 33. A. 24 Edw. 3.69. pl. 78. as in case of Patronage. For if it be [Nominare] this shall abate the Writ, 14 Hen. 4.11. 21 Hen. 6.17. A. for the Law takes no notice of such a term; but the Count shall be special, Nat. br. 33. A. and set forth the whole matter how he is enabled. For in 14 Hen. 4.11. per Hill. Nominator is in a manner the very Patron, and so taken notice of in Law as such, 24 Edw. 3.69. A grants to B that he shall have the next No∣mination to the Church of D when it is void, and that he shall present his Clerk to the Bishop, if the Grantee be disturbed, he shall have a Quare Impedit, for he is the Patron hac vice by the words of the Grant, Crooke 2 Hen. 8.161. pl. 1. per Read. The eldest Parcener shall have the first present∣ment,Parceners. Nat. br. 33. L. 38 Hen. 6.9. pl. 19. Doct. & Stud. 115. B. Nat. br. 34. Ʋ. Crooke 12 Hen. 7.1. A. and so in order by turns, if there be more than two. So the Husband of the eldest being Tenant by Courtesie, Nat. br. 33. L. 5 Hen. 5.10. pl. 24. for he is in upon his wifes right and title, originally. So he that hath the estate of the eldest, for his interest passeth with the estate, Nat. br. 34. Ʋ. but Crooke 18 Hen. 7.49. pl. 5. by Frowicke, if he
grant this when the Church is void before any presentment by him; the Grantee shall not have the first presentment, because he is a stranger in blood, and the Feoffee cannot claim that privi∣ledge in Law. Where a Parcener grants his Estate to B (the Church being void) yet the Parceners ought to joyn in a Quare Impedit, 11 Hen. 5.54. in respect of their joynt right and title at the time of the Grant. The pleading of a Partition between Parceners, No. Lib. Intra. 468. B, & C. If they make partition to present by turn, and the youngest dies, his Heir in ward to the King, he, viz. the King, shall present during the Non∣age, 21 Edw. 3.32. pl. 14. 22 Edw. 4. for his ward∣ship shall not make him lose his right to pre∣sent. Parceners agree to present by turn, this is a good partition as to the possession, 20 Edw. 3. Quore Imp. 63, 65. viz. of the Advowson. But Nat. br. 33 L. è contra, because the Inhe∣ritance is not. Quaere ergo. Doct. & Stud. 11. the King shall have the first presentment, the eldest the second. Quaere in what case. But 38 Hen. 6.9. pl. 19. the Issue of the eldest Coparcener was in ward to the King, there three others by their pleading shew a partition of the Mannor in Carvel, except the Advowson, and sue to the King to present, after the fourth sues for the Advowson; the Issue of the eldest shall present, because the presentment of the King was in right of them all, and not in right of the turn of the Issue.
Upon composition to present by turn, if it be inrolled in a Court of Record, they shall have a Scire facias one against the other, when their turn comes to present, Nat. br. 34. H. 21 Edw. 4.6. pl. 36. B. So against a Stranger that usurps in their turns, if the partition be of Record only, the Law takes no notice of it, Nat. br. 36. C. but they may joyn in a Quare Impedit against a Stranger, for the Law takes notice of their joynt title, and also present in common; but by this the composition is waved, Nat. br. 36. D. for it shews, they rely not upon the composition, but hold there to that way of pre∣sentation that the Law gives them. The surprize of one Parcener shall not put the other out of possession, when his turn comes a∣gain, for he gains no title by it, Nat. br. 34. J. 6 Edw. 3.210. pl. 13. 7 Edw. 3.239. pl. 27.17 Edw. 3.38. pl. 10. 30 Edw. 3.15. pl. 15. Although that it be made by the King in right of one Parcener, being in ward to the King, 22 Edw. 4.8. for the same reason. My Procurator presents as to his own Advow∣son,Procurator. as Procurator to me, by this I shall have a∣gain the possession, and out him, Nat. br. 35. O. 17 Edw. 3.60. pl 60. for by presenting as my Pro∣curator he acknowledgeth my right. Recoverer in right of an Advowson suffers an usurpation,Recoveter. he shall not have a Quaere Impedit, 45 Edw. 3. Quare Imped. 139. because he was not in actual possession of it by the Recovery, and so hath but a meer right still. Tenant for life or years of an Advowson suffers an usurpation,Reversio∣ner. the Lessor shall not be aided by
his own, Westm. 2. cap. 5. for it is a fault to lett it to such a Tenant. But his Heir shall be, Nat. br. 31. G. for he is in no fault. But 33 Hen. 6.12. pl. 3. 34 Hen. 6.27 pl. 8. è contra. Ergo quaere. If Tenant for years or a Gardein brings a Quare Impedit, and a Writ be awarded to the Bishop for the Defendant, yet the Tenant of the Franktenement is not out of possession, for the Presentee is in by course of Law, 50 Edw. 3.14. B. Coke 6. part. 50. B. Boswells case; and there∣fore the Tenants or Gardians interest shall not be prejudiced. The Queen shall have it alone,Queen. because she is a sole person exempt by the Common Law, and cannot joyn with any in a Suit; and the Writ shall not say unde queritur, because she shall not find Pledges, 18 Edw. 3.2. pl. 6. for it were dishonourable for her to find Pledges, for she shall be presumed to be sufficient, and so deal justly with all. The Lord that hath an Advowson by Escheat,Lord. shall have a Quare Impedit, the Count, Lib. Intra. 500. D. in respect of his Title accrued by Law. If an Abby, which hath an Appropriation, be dissolved, the Lord that hath the Mannor to which it was appendant shall have a Quare Impe∣dit to present to the Advowson, Nat. br. 33. K. Coke 2. part. 47. B. Canterburies case, 21 Hen. 7.4. B. Frowick, 20 Edw. 4.14. B. Com. 501. Gren∣dons case; for by the dissolution the Appropriati∣on is extinguished, and the Lord in of his old right to the Patronage.
Tenant in Tail.Tenant in tail suffers an Usurpation, he hath no remedy, for it was his own Latches to suffer it; but his Issue shall have a Quare Impedit, 49 Edw. 3.14. pl. 9. This is by the equ ty of Westm. 2. cap. 5. Coke 6. part. 50. B. Boswells case, who shall not be prejudiced by his Fathers act. Tenant in tail of a Mannor to which an Ad∣vowson belongs, enfeoffs A of the Mannor, which grants the Advowson to B, and re-enfeoffs the Tenant in tail; the Issue shall not have a Quare Impedit, because the other had no remedy, Nat. br. 35. B. 19 Hen. 6.30. and so shall not be in a better condition, and by the Grant of the Ad∣vowson apart it ceaseth to be appendant. Tenant in tail leases his Estate over, the Church voids, he dies, the Issue in tail shall present, 9 Edw. 3.10. and not the Lessee of the Mannor; for the presentation is not comprized in the Lease. Tenant in tail suffers an Usurpation before the Statute, the Issue shall not have a Quare Im∣pedit after the Statute, 8 Edw. 2. Quare Imp. 167. for before he was in no better a condition than his Ancestor, and the Statute was made for the be∣pefit of the Issue in tail. Tenant in Dower shall have the third present∣ment, where she is Dowable of the Thirds,In Dower. Nat. br. 33. L. 33 Hen. 8. br. Presentment 55. 15 Hen. 7.17. Q. what she shall have when she is Dow∣able of the half, during her Widowhood, by the custome of Gavel-kind. So if she have the third part of a Mannor to which an Advowson belongs, Nat. br. 34. Q. 6 Edw. 3.215. in the respect of interest in the Man∣nor, proportionable to it.
Tenant for life shall have a Quare Impedit,For life. in respect of his Freehold. The Count, Lib. Intra. 513. A. But if he suffers an Usurpation, he shall not have a Quare Impedit at any time after, 22 Hen. 6.26. B. for it was his own Latches to suffer it, for he might have brought his Quare Impedit upon the first disturbance. For years.Tenant for years shall have a Quare Impedit, al∣though he doth not present within the term, Nat. br. 34. B. 9 Edw. 3.338. pl. 6. 39 Hen. 6.39. viz. if the Church become void during the term, and no Lapse incurred, for it was a Chattel ve∣sted. Tenant in common shall not have it without his Companion,In com∣mon. Nat. br. 34. Ʋ. 14 Eliz. Dyer 304. pl. 52. 33 Hen. 6.11. B. in respect of their com∣mon interest, and that the Disturber may not be doubly vexed. He that traverseth an Office,Traverse. and hath the Land in Farm, shall have the presentment, if the Church be void during the time of his Lease, so it be found for him, although no mention be made of the Advowson, Nat. br. 34. P. for it goes with the Land. Note,Note. that the King upon an Office found for him, shall not put the Patron out of possession, without admission and institution of his Clerk, Coke 9. part. 96. A. Reynels case; for that is the only way to gain possession of an Advowson, and an Office may not be true, for it is traversable.
Against whom a Quare Impedit lies. Patron sole.It lies against a Patron sole, 29 Hen. 6.57. 19 Hen. 6.67. pl. 14. & fol 73. pl. 1. & fol. 75. pl. 5. But then the Incumbent shall not be removed, 29 Hen. 6.57. 7 Hen. 4.34. for if he be, it lies also against the Disturber. Unless there be no Incumbent at the time of the Writ brought, 29 Hen. 6.57. 19 Hen. 6.67. pl. 14. & fol. 73. pl. 1. & fol. 75. pl. 5. for then the Patron only must necessarily be the Distur∣ber. Incum∣bent sole.If it be against an Incumbent sole it shall abate, 3 Hen. 4.2. Quare Impedit 113. 41 Edw 3.2. Br. Quare Imped. 24. vide 47 Edw. 3.10. for he comes in under another mans right, who must be named in the Writ. But note, this is intended when the Inheritance, estate or interest of the Patron in the Patronage,Note. is to be devested by the Judgment, for otherwise he ought not to be named, Coke 7. part. 26. B. Halls case, for it concerns him not to be made a party. When there is no Patron, the Writ shall be a∣gainst the Incumbent sole, 13 Hen. 8.12. 4 Hen. 8.3. for there can be no other Disturber but he. When the King presents, it lies against the In∣cumbent sole, because the King shall not be sued, Coke 7. part. 26. B. Halls case, 92 Hen. 8. Dyer 48. pl. 16. 24 Edw. 3.77. pl. 103. Crooke 19 Hen. 7.53. pl. 9. But by Petition he may be sued too, and the Law intends he will do all his Subjects right without suit.
It lies for the Defendant against the Plaintiff,Plaintiff. if the Clerk of the Defendant be not instituted, Nat. br. 35. C. and he be disturbed by the Plaintiff. It seems this is meant where there is a cross Suit betwixt them. But not of the same presentation, if the Plain∣tiff have brought his Writ, 19 Hen. 6.67. pl. 14. & fol. 73. pl. 1. fol. 75. pl. 5. 22 Edw. 3.4. pl. 10. for he that first commences his Action shall first determine his right. The King grants a Free Chappel to B by Pa∣tent,Sheriff. if the Sheriff will not put him into possessi∣on, he shall have a Quare Impedit against the Sheriff, for this is in the nature of a Lay see, and belongs not to the Ordinary, and the Writ shall be general, 14 Hen. 4.11. pl. 9. Haukeford, as in other Quare Impedits; but the Count must be special, as it seems. Quare Impedit, of what disturbances it lies. If a Disturber presents three times within the six months;Disturber. Quare Impedit lies for the former, Nat. br. 35. R. of the Presentations; for there began the first cause of action. The Ordinary refuses to grant a Jure Patrona∣tus to try the Title, or to admit the Clerk, a Quare Impedit lies, 33 Hen. 6.12.32. 34 Hen. 6.11. 35 Hen. 6.38. for this is a disturbance to the Presentation. So if it be Litigious, and the Ordinary admit a Clerk without awarding a Jure Patronatus, 22 Hen. 6.25. Bre. 83. for this is to disturb by fore∣judging of the right.
So if he do not admit him within convenient time, 22 Hen. 6.29. for delays are disturbances, and accounted denials; for Justice ought to be speedily done. The Bishop refuses to admit the Clerk, because it was first found for another in a Jure Patronatus; this is a disturbance, Nat. br. 35. G. for he is not to take notice of the Suits between the parties. Unless the Admittas be delivered to him, 21 Hen. 6.44. for that is the Act of the Court, of which he is bound to take notice. Quare Impedit, of what things it lies. And if one had been disturbed before the Sta∣tute, yet he should have had the Writ, because the Statute refers before as well as after, 6 Edw. 3.221. pl. 51. Q. The Count, Lib. Intra. 646. C. It lies of a Chappel, 22 Hen. 6.25. B. antea.Chappel. And it lies by Westm. 2. cap. 5. Lib. Intr. 52. A. sell. 2. The Writ shall be Praesentatum ad Capellam liberam, Nat. br. 32. H. 8. But if the King brings a Quare Impedit of his free Chappel, it shall be praesentare ad Praebendam in his Frank Chappel, Nat. br. 33. & 16 Edw. 3.3. nota differentiam. It lies of a Deanary,Deanary. 17 Edw. 3.40. It lies of Domus Sancti Martini, in Bristol, Nat. br. 33 G.Domus S. Martini. Hospital. It lies of an Hospital, Nat. br. 33. G. pro Westm. 2. cap. 5. the Count, Lib. Intra. 506. C. Sect. 1. because they are all presentative.
De Medie∣tate Advo∣cationis.It lies not de medietate Advocationis, neque de Advocatioue medietatis Ecclesiae, Nat. br. 33. A. 33 Hen. 6.11. B. Prisot, vide 4 Hen. 6.15. B. for it must be of an entire thing, or at least so sup∣posed by the Writ, for the Law takes no notice of such moieties. But in such cases the Writ shall be general (scil. ad Ecclesiam) and not (ad medietatem Ec∣clesiae;) but the Count shall be special, and set forth special Title, Coke 5. part. 102. Winsors case, 16 Edw. 6. Dyer 78. pl. 44. But where there are two several Patrons, and two several Incumbents of the same Church, within one and the same Village, so that the Ad∣vowson and Church are severed in right and pos∣session, there one Patron may have a Quare Impedit de medietate Ecclesiae, Coke 10. part. 135. B. Smiths case; for there their Titles are en∣tire. 21 Hen. 6.4. pl. 8. in fine, One person says that he was Parson but of the Moiety of the Church, and good, 7 Edw. 3.246. pl. 24. Quare Impedit of the Moiety of the Church. Q. It lies of a Parsonage,Parsonage. and the Writ shall be ad Ecclesiam, because Ecclesia is intended of a Par∣sonage, Nat. br. 32. H. viz. the possession of the Church, Glebe, and Tithes. It lies of a Prebendary,Prebend. per Westm. 2. cap. 5. The Count, No. Lib. Intr. 507. B. The Writ shall be ad Praebendam, Nat. br. 32. H. 40 Edw. 3.17. pl. 7. but it ought to shew the name of it, 40 Edw. 3.17. to make it more cer∣tain, for else the word is too general.
It lies of the Subdeaconry of York,Subdea∣conry. Nat. br. 34. G. because presentative of right, as it seems. The Writ shall be quod permittat eum prae∣sentare, and yet the King gives it by his Letters ters Patents, Nat. br. 34. G. but it seems such Writs were but of puisne temps. It lies of a Vicarage,Vicarage. per 2. Westm. cap. 5. viz. a Vicarage to be endowed. The Writ shall be ad Vicariam, Nat. br. 32. H. which the Law well takes notice of. The Count in a Quare Impedit. He that brings a Quare Impedit in his count ought to alledge a Presentment in himself, or in his Ancestors, or in him by whom he claims, Nat. br. 33. H. 1. Unless a man erect a new Church, for then the Count shall be special, Nat. br. 33. H. 17 Edw. 3.12. and shall set it forth, to make it ap∣pear he cannot alledge a Presentment. 2. If he recover in a Writ of right, then he may alledge the presentation in him against whom he recovered, Nat. br. 33. J. Q. Or he may have this Writ without alleadging any presentation, for he may count upon the Re∣cord, Nat. br. 36. A. whereby he recovered, and that makes it appear the Presentation belongs to him. Or if he recover in a Quare Impedit, the same Law, 42 Edw. 3.8. pl. 5. 3. He may alleadge seisin in the Procurator, Nat. br. 33. J. 17 Edw. 3.60, & 75. which is, as it were his own seisin.
He that alleadges Presentation in himself, ought to shew that the Presentee was instituted, al∣though that it was against a Common person, for without Institution he had no fruit of his pre∣sentation, and so it is as nul. But against the King he ought to shew that he was Inducted, Com. 528. Bickleys case, Coke 6. part. 49. Boswelt case; for a man must make a full and compleat Title against the King. And such presentment ought to be within me∣mory, 17 Edw. 3.10. Quaere of the Law at this day. Presentati∣on in his own name.Devisee for life alleadges the presentation in himself, and good, Coke 5. part. 37. 8 Hen. 5.10. in respect of his Free-hold. Of the presentation of Tenant for life, vid. Coke 5. part. 97, 98. For years, 7 Edw. 4.20. 22 Edw. 4.9. B. In Dower. By the Courtesie. At Will, 5 Hen. 5.3. pl. 6. These are the presentments of him that hath Fee. Q. The King grants the Advowson to A, the Church being void, and presents, 13 Eliz. Dyer 330. pl. 36. by Lapse, 21 Eliz. Dyer 364. pl. 28. and good, for his grant hinders not, for he pre∣sents by Lapse upon another title. But the issue in Tail ought to alleadge pre∣sentment in the Donor, because he derives his title from him, or he may alledge it in himself, Com. Manxels case, fol. 4. B. If it be alleadged in the Donor or Donee, Lessor or Lessee, it is not double, because the
Presentment of the Lessor or Donor is only tra∣versable,Presentati∣on in him, by which he claims. and not of the Lessee or Donee, Coke 5. part. 99. A. Northumberlands case. For the Lessee ought regularly to alleadge it in the Lessor, Coke 5. part. 98. A. Yet, if he alleadge Presentation by himself it is good, 8 Hen. 25.4. But in the Judgment of the Law this is the Presentation of the Lessor, Coke 5. part. 89. and so taken notice of what ever he alleadge. A Purchaser may alleadge it in him whose E∣state he hath, because he derives from him, 13 Hen. 8.12. pl. 2. 2 Edw. 3. pl. 29.1. 6 Edw. 3.204. pl. 7. Nat. br. 33. H. He that brings a Quare Impedit ought to shew, specially how the Church becomes void, 5 Edw. 4.72. B. for the Iucumbent may be removed out of possession by Spoliation, Disseisin, or be outed otherways, yet then the Church is full in the eye of the Law. The Process in a Quare Impedit, 1. Before appearance; 2. After. Vide Lib. Intra. 52. B. Sect. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. At the Common Law it was but a Distress infinite, 11 Hen. 6.3. Martin. But per le Stat. Marlebridge, cap. 12. if he ap∣pears not at the Grand Distress, a Writ shall issue to the Bishop, 24 Edw. 3.37. 5 Edw. 4.115. 7 Eliz. Dyer 241. pl. 48. 7 Eliz. Dyer 241. pl. 1. Nat. br. 38. N. The same Law in a Scire facias by the King, upon a Judgment in a Quare Impedit, 14 Edw. 3. Qu. Imped. 5.
So if the Sheriff returns a Nihil upon the Grand distress, 12 Hen. 4.4. Hankeford, 21 Hen 6.56. pl. 13. 11 Hen. 6.3. pl. 8. because the Process is determined, vide 27 Hen. 6.5. pl. 32. for the Sheriff hath done as much as he can in the executing of it. And this is for the mischief of the Lapse, 24 Edw. 3.37. viz. in all the foregoing cases where∣in there is no Laches in the Patron, nor any de∣lay caused by him. But if a Nihil be returned upon the Summons, Attachment, and Distress, quaere 11 Hen. 6.3. if a Writ to the Bishop 4. shall issue; yet the better opinion there is, that a Writ shall issue to the Bishop. And this seems to be so upon the same ground, viz. for the mischief of a Lapse. And if a Quare Impedit be against two, and one appears at the Grand distress, the other makes default, a Writ shall issue to the Bishop pro querente against him that made default, Nt. br. 39. B. 14 Hen. 7.19. but not against the other because he appears according to Law. Quare Impedit against the Bishop and B,  makes default at the Grand distress, the Bishop pleads that he claims nothing but as Ordinary, the Plaintiff shall have a Writ to the Bishop against B, after the Count made against the De∣fendants upon the Bishops appearing at the Grand distress, 10 Hen. 6.4. Writ to the Bishop, 3. In a Quare Impedit the Defendant appears, and after appearance makes default, the Plantiff shall have a Writ to the Bishop, 2 Hen. 4.1. pl. 3. Nat. br. 38. S. because it shall be intended he will not longer defend himself.
At the Grand distress the Defendant pleads to issue, and after makes default, a Writ shall issue to the Bishop without more ado, for the Grand distress was issuable, 16 Edw. 3. Writ to the Bishop 17.12 Edw. 2. Quare Impedit 168. Upon a default at the Grand distress the Plain∣tiff shall have Judgment, Lib. Intra. 507. A. Sect. 1, 2, 3. Judgment, as upon a Nihil dicit. The Plaintiff is Non-suited, the Defendant shall have a Writ to the Bishop without making Title, as it seems; but the surest way is to make Title, 33 Hen. 6.1. pl. 2. for that puts all without question for the future. T brought an Assize of Darrein Presentment against P, and the Assize was taken by his, viz. P's default, and when the Assize was sworn, T with∣drawed himself; P shall have a Writ to the Bi∣shop, although he was not in Court, 9 Edw. 3. Darrein Presentment 17. for some Judgment must be, and it cannot be for T. And although P de default, yet the enquest might have found for him upon something of their own know∣ledge. Barr in a Quare Impedit, 1. By the Ordinary. 2. By others. Plea by the Ordinary the Church Litigious.The Church was Litigious, and he Collated after the six months, 34 Hen. 6.41. pl. 10. 5 Hen. 7.19. 34 Hen. 6.38. 2 Hen. 6.44. 18 Edw. 3. It shall be accounted Litigious, where there are two Presentations and two Commissions, and one
Commission is found for one,What shall be accoun∣ted Litigi∣ous. and another for ano∣ther, 22 H. 6.44. A. Newton & Paston; for no man here can judge whose the right is, for they are as it were in aequali jure. But if the Title of one be found, and another present, and request is made to admit the Clerk, for which it was found, it is not Litigious, 22 Hen. 6.28. Br. of Quare Impedit 80. for there is a Title found for one, and none for the other. If two Joyntenants, or Tenants in common present severally, it is not Litigious, Doct. & Stud. 116. A. for their right is one and the same. If two present severally, and neither the one nor the other pray a Commission to enquire the right, the Church is Litigious, Lib. Intra 511, & 512. 35 Hen. 6.18. pl. 27.8. Edw. 3.289. pl. 49. because the right of neither is put in issue. Claiming nothing but as Ordinary, Judgment, si, &c. without special disturbance; this is good, 5 Hen. 7.19. 22 Hen. 6.15. 33 Hen. 6..32. viz. a good plea in barr for the Ordi∣nary. But the Plaintiff upon this may pray Judg∣ment, and have it with Cessat Executio, until, &c. Crook 17 Hen. 7.43. pl. 9. the right determi∣ned. Pleas in disability of the person presented, are as followeth:Refusing the Clerk for default in the pre∣sentee which is. 1. An Alien, 7 Rich. 2. and this although he be made Denizen after, ibidem; viz. after he pre∣sented, for he was not idoneous at the time of the refusal.
2. Bastard, Coke 5. part. 58. A. 11 Hen. 4.8. A. 11 Hen. 7.12. 11 Hen. 4.37. but if he be ad∣mitted it is good. 29 Edw. 3.44. pl. 3. Q. whe∣ther, and by what Law it is a good plea, because he is nullius filius. 3. Blind, Coke 11. part. 29. B. For he can∣not see to study, nor can watch over his Flock. Q. tamen. For blind men have received Orders. 4. Heretick. Coke 11. part. 29. B. For he is not fit to instruct or guide his flock. 5. Homicide, 38 Edw. 3.2. For he is not fit to be a Minister of the Gospel of peace. 6. Infant, Coke. 5. part. 58. A. 6. Edw. 3.184. pl. 6. Herle. For he is not fit to guide himself or his own estate, much less others souls. 7. Jew. Coke 11. part. 29. B. qua a Jew; but if a convert, it seems he may. 8. Illiterate, 12 Eliz. Dyer. 293. pl. 3. Coke 5. part. 58. A. Specotts case. 40 Edw. 3.25. pl. 31. For he is unfit to teach, and had more need to be taught. 9. Perjured, For he will make little conscience of Religion. 10. Irreligious. 5 Hen. 7.6. Q. how. 11. Miscreant, Coke 5. part. 58. A. Specotts case, viz. that believes not rightly the Articles of the Faith: For how will he maintain and in∣struct others in it? 12. Not able upon examination, 39 Edw. 3.1. pl. 5. viz. of the Ordinary in the principles of Religion, and other fit qualifications. 13. Premunire, 38 Edw. 3.3. pl. 9. In re∣gard of the heinousness of the offence and pu∣nishment.
14. Himself patron, 31 Hen. 6.621. For he ought not to present himself. 15. Saracen, Coke 11. part 29. B. or Turk, or Infidel, not acknowledging God and Christ. 16. Schismatick, Coke 5. part. 58. A. Specotts case. For he will make disturbance in the Church. 17. Simonist. Lib. intra. 532. A. Q. By what Law. 18. Villain, 14 Hen. 7.28. B. for he is not sui juris. 19. Utlaw, Coke 5. part. 48. A. Specotts case, For he is fit for no society, and unfit to teach obedience to others, that hath none himself. These are good Causes of refusal, viz. which are above specified. Where one having a Parsonage in Wales,Note. and could not speak Welsh, and therefore excepted un∣to as insufficient, it was demurred to Trin. 27 Eliz. Albany versus Episcopum S. Asaf. Q. De¦ley. as not a sufficient cause. These are not good causes of refusal. That he hath another Benefice with Cure, 14 Hen. 7.28. B. For he may be qualified to have two Benefices by the Stat. Hunter of Taverns and a player at unlawful Games, Coke 5. part. 57. Specotts case. 9 Eliz. Dyer. 254. For this makes him not unfit to watch, though it make him scandalous, for which he ought to be punished.
Criminosus, 34 Hen. 6.39. A. For that is a word of a very large extent, and uncertain. These are good causes of refusal in the Presenter. Attainted, 15 Hen 5.17. B. Keble. viz. of Felony or Treason. Presenter which is.Excommunicated per 40 days 115 Hen. 7.7. B. Keble. and so stands excommunicated in con∣tempt of the Church. This Law is now altered by the taking away the Ecclesiastical jurisdiction in that point, and now is again revived. Infant not of the Age of 14 years, Perkins. 4. A. For he shall not be judged of sufficient discre∣tion to present a fit person. Q. tamen. Joynt Tenant or Tenant in common not a∣greeing, Nat. br. 34. V. concerning their present∣ing; for that is litigious. The same Law is of one present alone, 14 Eliz. Dyer. 340. pl. 54. except it be by con∣sent. A Master of a Colledge presented by the Col∣ledge, 14 Hen. 8.23. For that is like as when the Patron presents himself. Utlawed, 15 Hen. 7.17. B. Keble. For he can have no Title. A Corporation ought to present in writing,Presenta∣tion. 14 Hen. 8.2. and not by parol, for they cannot ill speak at once, as they may by writing. A Body natural may present by word, 14 Hen. .22. The King may present by word, 19. Edw. 3. Quare impedit. 60. For he is but one person nume∣rical,
though he hath a political capacity, and speaks in the plural number. It is no Bar to say that the other Writ was abe∣ted,Abate∣ment. if it were for form or false Latine, Coke . part 27. B. Portmans case. For that is not the fault of the Plaintiff, but of the Clark. But that it was abated, because the 1 Plaintiff was made Knight, the Writ depending, this is  good Bar, Coke 7. part. 27. B. Portmans case. For it was his own fault. The Plaintiff counts of the presentment to the Advowson in Gross,Appen∣dant. and a Grant of it to him; the Defendant pleads it was appendant, he cannot traverse that it was not in gross, because by in∣tendment they are several Advowsons, Crooke. 19 Hen. 7.51. pl. 1. For one and the same Advowsee cannot be in gross, and also appendant. An Arbitrement is a good Bar,Arbitre∣ment. Lib. intra. 498. C. s. 1. A Confirmation or ratification by the King to the Incumbent is a good Bar against the King▪ 7 Hen. 4.13.14 Hen. 4.25.837. Lib. intra. 531. sect. 22. by way of estopple.Confirma∣tion. But this ought to be after Induction, 11 He. 4.9. For before he shall not be said to be a per∣fect Incumbent, as to the King. If the King be deceived, he may repeal the Confirmation, 31 Edw. 3. Quare impedit, 161 This by his prerogative; for the King ought  be truly informed. But then the repeal ought to be before Ind∣ction or Installation, 25 Edw. 3.47. for after  is too late.
If the King recover and confirm the Incum∣bent, this is no Bar to the next avoidance, because his Judgment cannot be executed, Nat. br. 34. F. 10. Edw. 3.389. pl. 32. 18 Edw. 3.57. pl. 87. But if he Lease the Advowsons afterwards, uare who shall have them? Where one brought a Quare impedit,Disconti∣nuance. and dis∣cootinued his Action, adjudged a good Bar, al∣though that the Writ was purchased afterwards within the 6 Months, Coke 7. part. 27. B. Port∣nans case. For it shall be intended he hath no right. A Fine levied by the Ancestor of the Plaintiff of the Advowson, is a good Bar,Fine. Lib. intra. 532. C. sect. 3. Warranty and Assets descended to the heir,Warranty is a good Bar against the Issue in Tail, 43. Edw. 3.24. pl. 31. No Di∣sturber.That he did not disturb, is a good bar, Lib. tra. 503. C. sect. 2. 22 Edw. 3.17. pl. 71. For a good Issue may be taken upon it. This may be pleaded to the grand Distress, 22 Edw. 3.17. pl. 71. as well as if he had appeared upon the first summons. But 21 Hen. 6.45. A. 2 Edw. 3.32. pl. 7. It is held that it is no Bar, because no Title is made. 14. Edw. 3. Judgment, 158. and before Title made there needs no plea; yet Q. For he may, as it seems, admit a Title. But if it be a good plea before Issue, yet after Issue joyned it is not, because it is a delay, and so a disturbance in it self in the eye of the Law,
3 Edw. 3.50. pl. 6.4. Edw. 3.97. pl. 31.17. Edw. 3.71. But 18. Edw. 3.149. pl. 15. & fol. 359.  è contra, after title made, this is no plea, 5 Hen. 4.20. Br. Quare impedit, 62. Q. Against the King it is no Bar, because the patty there ought to make a title, 7 Hen. 4.32. pl. 18. Non-suit after appearance in another Quare impedit before for the same advowson,Non-suit. is a good Bar: although the last be purchased within 6 Months, Coke. 7. part. 27. B. Portmans case. 21 Hen. 6.25.27. For that argues he had no right, and that his Suit was only vexatious. And so if the former Writ were brought by the Plaintiff and another, and the Plantiff is non∣suit, 5 E. 157. pl. 10. For thereby he desists in his Claim. No such Church.No such Church in the same County, is no Bar, 8 Hen. 6.37. pl. 69. 9 Hen. 6.17. Q. But 45 Edw. 3.36. pl. 2. è contra. Q. Pardon of the King for alienation is no Bar,Pardon. if the Church be void before the pardon, 27 Edw. 3.38. For then the pardon works not upon the precedent right. Plentary a good Bar,Plentary. though the Patron his no notice of the Avoidance; for this is to stop the Collation of the Ordinary, but not the Pre∣sentation of the Patron, Pasch. 39 Eliz. Com. B. Seriven against the Bishop of Lincolne. Plenarty of a Frank Chappel is no Bar; for if he shall be put to his Quare impedit, then it shall be presentative afterwards, 22 Hen. 6.25. B. Which is mischievous to the Patron, in ma∣king
it subject to the visitation of the Ordinary. The Church is said to be full against a common person by Institution, 22 Hen. 6.27. A. 14 Hen. 8 2. Brudenel. 12 Hen. 4.38. For by that the Clerk is approved, and Induction is but as it were giving of possession. And against the King by Induction, 22 Hen. 6.27. B. which makes him a compleat Incumbent to all intents and purposes. He that pleads plenarty, ought to say that it is full of his own presentment, and not of ano∣thers; for if the Defendant be disturbed, he shall not be punished, and if he hath title, he ought to shew it, 3 Hen. 6.20. Br. plenarty 6. 16 Edw. 4.11.8 Edw. 3. Statham. He shall plead that he was in per 6 Months of his Presentment before the purchase of the Ad∣vowson by the Plantiff. But if it be of a presentment of the predecessor of the Plaintiff, yet it is good, 8 Edw. 3. pre∣sentment 5. The 6 Months shall be accounted according to the Kalendar, Coke 6. part. 61, 62. Catesbyes case; and not after 28 days to the Month; for that is the ancient account used in Law. Who shall plead Plenarty, and who not. Incumbent pleads Plenarty of himself,Incum∣bent. ex prae∣sentatione B. viz. the Plantiff. Coke. 6 part 48.2 Hen. 6.14. pl. 22. No. Lib. intra. 265. A. absque hoc that it was void; for the Incumbent is not able to plead it otherways, per 25 Edw. 3. cap. 7.
But 16 Edw. 4.11. pl. 6. Com. 501. A. Man∣wood è contra. Ergo Q. Because he that pleads this, ought to say, that the Incumbent is in of his own presentation, 2 Rich. 2. Incumbent 4. Belknap. 46 Edw. 3.19. 18 Edw. 3. Quare Impedit 48. and not of ano∣thers. But per 4 Edw. 4.13. The Incumbent pleads that the Plaintiff, or his predecessor presented him. Q. For it seems to be uncertain. Parson imparsonee cannot plead plenarty, be∣cause that he cannot say, that he is in per six Months of his own presentment, 38 Hen. 6.20. B. 33 Hen. 6.12. pl. 27. Com. 501. A. Man∣wood. 39 Hen. 6.20.46. Assize. pl. 4. A Stranger, or he that claims nothing in the Patronage, cannot plead Plenarty, 7 Hen. 4.34. per Fitz James. For it lies not in his mouth to say whether the Church be full or not. Against whom Plenarty is no Plea. Against the Lord that enters for Mortmain, it is no Plea; because the Lord hath liberty by the Law to enter at any time within the year, 21 Edw. 3.27. pl. 25. 29 Edw. 3.10. pl. 31. Thorpe. 47 Edw. 3.11. pl. 8. But after the year it is a good plea, 25 Edw. 3.34. 26 Edw. 3. Quare Impedit. 163. For then he is in the condition of another Pe∣tron. Quaere if it be good against the Lord by cheat,  Hen. 8.14. Brudenel. It seems
it is, for he shall be in no better condition then, than the Patron that died without Heir. It is no plea against the King, 35 Hen. 6.26. A. 1 Edw. 3.17. pl. 9. 8 Edw. 3.304. pl. 55. 43 Edw. 3.14. pl. 8. For it is not a Plea in chief to determine the right, but only delatory, and the King shall not be delayed. But against the Queen, Mother or Consort, it seems to be good, 18 Edw. 3.13. pl. 9. 44 Edw. 3. Br. Plenarty 4. For she is but a sub∣ject, and shall be in no better condition in the eye of the Law. A good Bar to say,Presenta∣tion. that the Plaintiff present∣ed his Clerk, and that he was inducted before the Writ purchased, 12 Hen. 4.11. pl. 21. vide Crooke. 12 Hen. 7.20. pl. 6. For then he could have no cause of Action. A Recovery in another Quare Impedit,Recovery. no Bar against the King, for he may make another Ti∣tle, Nat. br. 35. P. than was made before, and a better it may be. A Recovery by by the Plaintiff against another in a Quare Impedit for the same Advowson, no Bar; for there might be two disturbers. Recovery by a Stranger in another Quare Impe∣dit, no Bar, Crooke. 18 Hen. 7.49. pl. 4. For nothing concerns the present Plaintiff. That the Plaintiff is a Recusant Convict,Recusancy a good Bar; for the Presentment is given to the University, per 3 Jac. And therefore the Plain∣tiff can have no cause of Action. Release of Actions Personals a good Bar,Release. 22 Hen. 6.25, vel 27. Littleton. fol. 116. A.
30 Hen. 6. Bar. 59. For this is a mixt Action, and so it is personal in part. So of Actions real, Litteton 116. A. 9 Hen. 6.57. Martin: For being next, it is also real as well as personal. If a Presentment be alledged in the Ancestry of the Plaintiff, it is a good Bar to plead a Re∣lease and Quit claim of the Ancestry, pro fine 8 Edw. 2. Quare Impedit 166. For thereby the Plaintiffs cause of Action is extinct. If there be more Plaintiffs in a Quare Impedit than one, the Release of one is no Bar, but for him only that released, Coke 5. part 97. B. Nor. thumberlands case. 30 Hen. 6. Bar. 59. Forte∣scue. For their Titles may be distinct and seve∣ral. Judgment in a Quare Impedit. 1. When he shall have Judgment. 2. Of what things he shall have Judgment. Upon default after apppearance,Upon de∣fault. the Plaintiff shall have Judgment and Dammages, 2 Hen. 4.1. pl. 3. Nat. br. 38. S. For this is, as it were, the confession of the Plaintiffs Title. But upon default after a continuance, Distress shall issue out only, 6 Rich. 2. viz. before appa∣rence make him to appear. Upon Default at the grand Distress the Plain∣tiff shall have Judgment, Lib. intra. 507. A. sect. 1, 2, 3. For that is the last process to bring in the Defendant; and the Plaintiff can proceed no further upon mean process.
In a Quare Impedit against two, and one makes default after appearance, the Plaintiff shall have Judgment against him that makes default, Nat. br. 39. B. But not against the other; for anothers de∣fault shall not prejudice him. If in a Quare Impedit against three, one makes default after apparance, and it is found against the Plaintiff for the others that appeared, who make a title, and it seems they shall have a Writ to the Bishop, 31 Hen. 6.15. pl. 5. Q. One Defendant makes Title by himself, and o∣thers make default, the Judgment shall be to have a Writ to the Bishop for him that makes Title; but this is not before the Plaintiff have counted, Nat. br. 38. J. 10 Hen. 6.4. pl. 13. For before that the cause of Action doth not appear. Upon the Non-suit of the Plaintiff,Non-suit. the Defen∣dant shall have a Writ to the Bishop, but not be∣fore Title made, Nat. br. 38. K. 2 Hen. 5.6. pl. 28. 19 Edw. 4.9. pl. 10. 6 Edw. 3.23. Collu∣sion 5. 14 Hen. 4.11. That it may appear he hath a colourable right at the least. Unless the Non-suit be after a Bar pleaded, 33 Hen. 6.1. pl. 2. & fol. 55. pl. 48. against the Defendants Title. Three sue a Quare Impedit, and two are non∣suited, and one of the Plaintiffs was also one of the Defendants, therefore he cannot make Title, ideo quaere, if they shall not have a Writ to the Bi∣shop without Title made, 11 Hen. 6.8. pl. 13. Q. A. sued divers Writs of Quare Impedit against B, of the same Church, and is non suited in all exceptone, the Defendant shall not have a Writ
to the Bishop until that be determined, Nat. br. 38. R. For it may be the Plaintiff may clear his Title by that. The Defendant makes Title to himself and another, the Plaintiff is non-suited, the Defen∣dant shall have a Writ to the Bishop only, 13 Edw. 3. br. Epise. 25. For his Title is a Bar to the Plaintiff which is not opposed. The Sheriff returns a tardè, &c. the Plaintiff makes default, he shall be non-suited; Q. but the Defendant shall not have a Writ to the Bishop, because the Writ was not served, 2 Hen. 5.3. pl. 14. Nat. br. 38. O. 2 Hen. 5.6. nor the o∣ther Non-suited, as it seems, because the Writ was not duly executed. If an Infant be non-suited, the Defendant shall have a Writ to the Bishop, 2 Mariae Dyer. 104. pl. 13. to avoid a lapse, and that the Church may speedily be provided for. A. brought a Quare Impedit against B, C and D, and is non-suited, B dies, C and D shall not have execution alone, 11 Edw. 3. br. Episcopo 55. because the Action was joyntly brought against all. If one of the Co-parceners who bring a Quare Impedit, be non-suited, yet the other may sue, and the Defendant shall not have a Writ to the Bishop upon this Non-suit, 38 Edw. 3.35. br. Episc. 12. because they have several Inheritances, and the default of one shall not bind another. The Plaintiff discontinued his Suit,Disconti∣nuance. the De∣fendant shall have Judgment to have a Writ to the Bishop, Coke 7. part. 27. B. For his disconti∣nuance concludes he had no cause of Action.
A. brought a Quare Impedit against B,Composi∣tion. and sued a Ne admittas, and then they compounded to present by turn, there shall be a special Writ out of the Chancery to the Bishop, to admit the Clerk that ought first to be admitted. For a spe∣cial Cause may have a special Writ, and varying from the usual form. In a Quare Impedit the Defendant disclaims in the Advowson, the Plaintiff shall have Judgment,Disclaimer and a Writ to the Bishop, 6 Edw. 3.7. Error 78. For by the Disclaimer he acknowledgeth he hath no Title. Where a Writ abates for form or false Latine,Abate∣ment. there shall not be Judgment for the Defendant to have a Writ to the Bishop, Nat. br. 38. H. 14 Hen. 4.11. 13 Hen. 4.7. For the Title is not determined, but only the Plaintiff is delayed. The Defendant makes default, the Incumbent abates the Writ by plea, the Defendant shall not have a Writ to the Bishop, because he made de∣fault, Nat. br. 38. H, and so is not rectus in Cu∣ria. If the Plaintiff being a Prebend, be made a Bishop in Dublin, this shall abate the Writ, per Wilby, 24 Edw. 3.26. pl. 21. Q. how it shall be taken notice of here. If the Writ abates for Misnosmer, or other non-sufficiency in it, the Defendant shall not have a Writ to the Bishop, Nat. br. 38. M. 31 Hen. 6.15. For the right is not determined. If a Quare Impedit is brought in Com. M. and the Count is of a Church in Com. O, the Writ shall abate, but the Defendant shall not
have a Writ to the Bishop, 21 Rich. 2.29. for the former reason. It was found by verdict that the Metropolitan collated where the Ordinary ought to have done it,Verdict. when the year is passed, the Plaintiff shall have a Writ to the Bishop, Nat. br. 38. P. Q. In a Quare Impedit between A and B, if the Title appear for the King, Judgment shall be given for him, Nat. br. 38. E. notwithstanding he is not party to the Suit, that is, by his Pre∣rogative. All the Judges are the Kings Counsel, and ought to give Judgment for him, where his Right appears, although he sue not for it. The Writ to the Bishop, to whom it shall be directed. If a man recover against another as well as the Bishop, he ought to have a Writ to the Bishop of the Diocess, Nat. br. 38. C. For a Bishop is but a Minister to admit the party. If the Writ be against the Bishop, although he claim but as Ordinary, yet the Plaintiff shall have a Writ to the Bishop, 8 Hen. 4.22. Lib. intra. 521. For he claims no right, nor doth any thing by executing the Writ in prejudice of himself. If a man recover against the Bishop, he shall have a Writ to the Bishop or Metopolitan, Nat. br. 38. B. and Q. 18 Eliz. Dyer. 353. pl. 30. 38 Edw. 3.12. B. at the election of the party, as it seems. If it be once to the Metropolitan, he shall never have it to an inferior Bishop afterwards, ibidem,
for it is not usual in Law to descend from a higher authority to a lower. Or to the Vicar general, if the Bishop be out of the Realm, Nat. br. 38. Q. For the Vicar general an Officer under the Archbishop. Or to the Gardein of the Spiritualties of the ch-bishop, 7 Hen. 4.36. for the same reason,  it seems. If there be no Bishop of the Diocess, then to e Metropolitan; if no Metropolitan, then to e Gardein of the Spiritualties, but if before the accution the Archbishop be made, quaere if the power of the Gardein be not determined, 18 Eliz. Dyer. 350. pl. 19. It seems it is. If it be against the Arch-bishop of York, the Writ shall be to the Metropolitan, 15 Eliz. Dyer. 328. pl. 7. viz. of all England, viz. the Arch∣bishop of Canterbury. The King recovers a Prebendary or Sub-Dea∣ry, or other Dignity against the Bishop, and es it by Letters Patents to A, yet A shall uve a Writ to the Bishop to be admitted to the ings right. And if he die before induction, d the, King grants this to B, he shall have a Writ out of the Chancery, and a Writ to the Bi∣hop, Nat. br. 38. D. It seems the Writ shall be pecial. The King recovers a Prebendary, and hath  Writ to two Bishops, because the Prebendary as in one Diocess, and the Church to which e Prebendary belongs, is in another Diocess, 14 Edw. 3.37. pl. 56. and so it concerns both he Bishops.
If a man recover a Chappel donative, he shall have a Writ to the Sheriff, Nat. br. 48.8. For it is in the nature of a Lay Fee, and lies not wish∣in the jurisdiction of the Ordinary. Process in a Writ to the Bishop. The Process is alias, plures, Attachment, or a Writ de quare non admisit, Nat. br. 47. C. Of what things a man shall have Judgment. 1. A Writ to the Bishop, and no dammages. Coke 6. part. 51. A. Boswels Case. At the Common Law were no dammages in a Quare Impedit. But by the Statute dammages are given, as the Statute following mentions. Statute Westm. 2. cap. 5. is, Si tempus semestre transier it per impedimentum alicujus, ita quod Epi∣scopus ad Ecclesiam conferat, & verus Patron  ea vice praesentationem amittat, adjudicentur da∣pna ad valorem medietatis Ecclesiae pro duob annis, & si non transierit sed disrationetur praesen∣tatio infra tempus praedictum tunc adjudicentur da∣pna ad valorem medietatis Ecclesiae per unum a∣num. The King is not within this Statute to have dammages, for at the Common Law the King was not in danger to lose his presentation per ple∣narty, Coke 6. part. 51. A. Boswels case. 3 He. 6. Dammges 17. 34 Hen. 6.51. 14 Edw. 3. Quare Impedit 54. 33 Edw. 3. Br. 916. vide 7 Edw. 6. Dyer. 236. pl. 28. And the Statute was made only for that intent▪
If it is found for the Plaintiff, and that the Church is full, the Plaintiff may have a Writ to the Bishop, but then he shall recover no dam∣mages, 24 Edw. 3.35. pl. 42, & 75. pl. 97. for he could not be damnified by reason of the ple∣rty. It is found that the Ordinary presented before is time, the Plaintiff releases dammages, and had  Writ to the Bishop, 11 Hen. 4.79. pl. 22. for the Ordinary had no right to present. The Ordinary claims nothing but as Ordinary, the Plaintiff had Judgment against him as Ordi∣ty, and the Disturber and his Clerk dies, the Plaintiff shall have execution, but it seems no dammages, Crooke 17 Hen. 7.43. pl. 9. Quaere en, for it seems not reasonable that he should be without remedy. The Defendant comes the first day, and con∣fesseth the Action, there shall be a Writ to the Bishop, but no dammages, 4 Edw. 2. Dammages 9. 5 Edw. 3.133. pl. 13. 5 Edw. 3.139. pl. 44. in re∣gard of the smalness of them, for de minimis  curat Lex. In a Quare Impedit against the Incumbent, the King revokes his presentation, the Plaintiff shall have no dammages against the Incumbent, 44 Edw. 3.35. B. because he came in upon the Kings presentation, and is now ousted by him. The Plaintiff shall not have dammages against the Incumbent, if he pleads not, or is not proved  Disturber, 45 Edw. 3. Dammages 39. but shall recover only the presentation, 5 Edw. 3.13. but by his pleading he is a Disturber, and dammages are recoverable for the disturbance.
A Writ to the Bishop,Single mmages. and single dammages, 17 Edw. 3.5. pl. 12. 24 Edw. 3.37. pl. 54.26 Edw. 3.75. pl. 25. A sues B and C, and it is found that B only had right, B shall have dammages against A and C, 45 Edw. 3.14. pl. 12. & br. Episcopo, for they are both Disturbers as to B. In a Quare Impedit against the Ordinary and B, the Ordinary confesses the Action, and it is found against B, and that the Church is full of the pre∣sentment of B, the Plaintiff shall have a Writ to the Bishop, and single dammages, or double dam∣mages, and no Writ to the Bishop at his election, 39 Edw. 3.15. but shall not have both, 5 Edw. 3.150. pl. 10. for this would be double satisfaction for one tort. The Defendant confesses the Action, the Plain∣tiff shews that the six Months are past, and had a Writ to the Bishop and dammages, 21 Edw. 3.55. pl. 8. 20 Edw. 3. Collusion 34. 6 Edw. 6. Dyer 76. pl. 35. by the Statute. The Plaintiff and the Ordinary are at issue upon the ability of the Incumbent, the Ordinary admits him, the Plaintiff shall have a Writ to the Bishop, and single dammages; for the ad∣mittance proves him able, 40 Edw. 3.25. pl. 21. and consequently the Ordinary a Disturber, and to pay dammages. A Writ to the Bishop to admit the parties Clerk, and a Writ to the Sheriff to enquire of dammages, 19 Edw. 3. Quare Impedit 156. 24 Edw. 3.37. Lib. Intr. 507. C. Sect. 6, 7, 8. sustained by the distur∣bance.
It was found that the Metropolitan collated be∣fore his time, the Plaintiff shall have a Writ to the Bishop, but then he shall have but single dammages, 11 Hen. 4.80. Nat. br. 38. P. vid. le Stat. The Bishop grants proximam praesentationem to B, and dies, the Church voids, the Successor col∣lates, B brings his Quare Impedit within six Months, two years pass, the Plaintiff had judg∣ment, and upon his prayer had a Writ to remove the Incumbent, and single dammages, and a Writ to the Bishop or Metropolitan at his election, 2 & 3 Mariae, Eliz. Dyer 194. pl. 33. to admit his Clerk. Quare Impedit against the Ordinary who Collates, and pleads to the Plaintiff that the six months are passed, the Plaintiff recovers the presentation and single dammages; for where the Ordinary claims as Ordinary where he cannot maintain the right, he cannot collate as Ordinary for the time past, 5 Edw. 3.150. pl. 19. Coke 5. part. 58. B. 30 Edw. 3.15. pl. 4. The same Law is upon a recovery against ano∣ther man, if the Plaintiff will at his peril have a Writ to the Bishop, 6 Edw. 6. Dyer 77. pl. 35. 11 Hen. 4.79. pl. 22. Quare Impedit against the Bishop of L. the Me∣tropolitan, and against G his Clerk, they all three make default at the Grand distress, and a Writ of enquiry of the points in the Writ, and dammages was awarded, and thereupon found that the Church was void two years, and that the Me∣tropolitan collated G; and Judgment was that the Plaintiff shall have a Writ to the Bishop, and
single dammages; but because the Church void so long, and the Defendants in misericordia, 7 Eliz. Dyer 241. pl. 48. A Writ to the Bishop, and double dammages. Quare Impedit against the Ordinary and B, the six Months pass, the Plaintiff shall have double dammages, although the Ordinary did not col∣late, because he had jus conferendi, and also a Writ to the Bishop, 43 Edw. 3.10. pl. 33. The Plaintiff recovers double dammages, be∣cause the six Months were passed; and also a Writ to the Bishop, and his Clerk instituted, because the Bishop did not collate; but this was not done by the party, 8 Edw. 3.280. pl. 9. Q. A man shall recover double dammages, al∣though he recover all before the six Months pass, 13 Edw. 4.3. Littleton. by the Stat. of W. 2. Single dammages, and no Writ to the Bishop. Before the return of the Writ to enquire of dammages, the six Months pass, the Bishop col∣lates; yet but single dammages, 24 Edw. 3.35. pl. 13. 27 Edw. 3. Dammages 106. But the reason it seems is, because of the for∣mer Judgment, that he shall have a Writ to the Bishop; and this being of Record shall stop him from double dammages, for he is to have his Clerk thereby admitted. 22 Hen. 6.28. Dammages, but no Writ to the Bishop. Quare Impedit against a Parson impar∣sonee, and found for the Defendant, he shall
have dammages, but no Writ to the Bishop, Nat. br. 38. L. 26 Hen. 6. bre Episcopo 6. for such Writ would be to no purpose. Double dammages, and no Writ to the Bishop. Quare Impedit against the Ordinary and B, the Ordinary confesseth the Action, and it is found against B, and that the Church is full of the pre∣sentment of B, the Plaintiff shall have double dammages, but no Writ to the Bishop; or shall have single dammages, and a Writ to the Bishop at his election, 39 Edw. 3.15. but not both; for the double dammages are in recompence of his presentation. The Ordinary intitles himself by Lapse, the Patron and Incumbent confess the Action, the Plaintiff shall have double dammages against the Patron and Incumbent, 34 Hen. 6.41. 34 Hen. 6.39. because the Church is full. Quare Impedit against the Patron and Incum∣bent, they traverse the Title, the six Months pass, the Plaintiff, if he recovers, shall have dou∣ble dammages against both, 46 Edw. 3.15. pl. 5. Vid. the Stat. Two Writs to the Bishop. The Defendant in a Quare Impedit brought a Darrein presentment against the Plaintiff, the Plaintiff is nonsuited in the Quare Impedit▪ the Defendant recovers in the Darrein presentment, the Defendant shall have Judgment to have two Writs to the Bishop, but shall not have dam∣mages
twice, Nat. br. 39. D. viz. upon the Plain∣tiffs nonsuit one, and upon his own recovery ano∣ther, for that would be double amends. In what Court, and what Judges have power to award a Writ to the Bishop. Justices of Nisi prius have power, per Westm. 2. cap. 30, & 40. 14 Edw. 3. cap. 16. 9 Eliz. Dyer 260. pl. 21. 6 Edw. 6.76. pl. 34. The Lords, it seems, of Mannors, Judges in Wales, have not power, 36 Hen. 6. B. Fortesue, 35 Hen. 6.30. pl. 35. 3 Edw. 3.63. pl. 35. 8. Edw. 3.319. pl. 15. 24 Edw. 3.33. pl. 26. Regist. orig. 31. A. for the Bishops are not tied to take notice of their Writs. Lord in ancient Demesn hath no power to a∣ward a Writ to the Bishop, 7 Hen. 6.35. for this is an inferiour Court circumscribed within its own Jurisdiction. The Five Ports cannot award a Writ to the Bi∣shop, 21 Hen. 7.88. pl. 7. Crooke; for these are particular Franchises within themselves. Ne Admittas. What Persin shall have it. The Plaintiff in a Quare Impedit, or Darrein Presentment, shall have it, Nat. br. 35 F. So the Defendant shall have it, Nat. br. 37. H. In what Cases it lies. When a Quare Impedit or Darrein Presentment is depending, and the Plaintiff or Defendant sup∣poseth that the Bishop will admit the Clerk of the other, then a Ne admittas lies, Nat. br. 37. F.
Regist. orig. 31. A. 21. Hen. 44. Newton, Vet. Nat. br. 24. B. to hinder the Bishop from admitting any Clerk till the right be determined. If one of the Writs be not depending, then it Its not, Nat. br. 37. H. viz. a Quare Impedit or Darrein Presentment, for this Writ supposeth a Title in question, which must be by one of those Writs. For if the right of Advowson is depending, it lies not, because the Presentation is not to be recovered in it, Nat. br 48. Q. and so the admit∣tance of a Clerk is not in question. But note,Note. that this lies before any Certificate made, that a Quare Impedit or Darrein Present∣nent is depending, Nat. br. 37. H. for depending of the Writs rests not upon the Certificate. Yet the party grieved by the Ne admittas shall have a Writ to the Chief Justice, to certifie if any Writ be depending; and if he certifie none, then a Supersedeas shall be awarded, Nat. br. 37. H. to supersede the Ne admittas. Note,Note. that this Writ does not hinder the Or∣dinary, but that he may present by Lapse, unless he be party, Nat. br. 48. L. Vet. Nat. br. 24, & 25. iz. party to the Suit, for else it concerns him not. Within what time this ought to be brought. Within six Months, and not after by reason of Lapse. Locum habet infra tempus semestre, & non pstea, quia Diocesanus illam conferat per Lapsum temporis ad sex menses, quia Diocesanus ilud spectaliter t indutum, Regist. orig. 37. F.
Yet for the King it always keeps place, Regist. orig. 31. A. Nat. br. 37. F, & G. vide Br. for nullum tempus occurrit Regi, the King is not tied to circumstances of time or place, &c. The Writ. The Writ shall be alone, although the Bishop be party, as where not; Tamen olim fuit, ne con∣feratis alicui Ecclesiam de N. quae vacat, Regist. orig. 31. A, B. Nat. 38. A. The Process. Is Prohibition, Attachment, and Distress, Nat. br. 24, & 25. Quare non admisit. Out of what Court this issueth. It issueth out of the Com. Bau. because it issu∣eth out of the Rolls of the Court, Regist. orig. 32. A. Vet. Nat. br. 25. B. 12 Edw. 3. Quare non ad∣misit 6. For this is a Judicial Writ, Vet. Nat. br. 25. B. Regist. orig. 32. A. 12 Edw. 3. Quare non admisit 6. & per Nat. br. 47. C. grounded upon a Record of Court. This may issue out of the Chancery in the Va∣cation also; for in the Vacation it cannot issue out of the Common Pleas. If the King recover in Com. Ban. in Quare Impedit, he may have this Writ in Ban. Regis, Nat.
br. 47. D. for this Writ is but to have the effect of his Suit, and he may seek for his right in any of his Courts. What Person shall have it. Every one that recovers, if the Bishop will not admit, his Clerk shall have it, Nat. br. 47. C. Vet. Nat. br. 25. B. or else his Suit would be but fruit∣less, if it were not compulsory. Against whom it lies. It shall be brought against the Bishop, although the Vicar general made the refusal, Vet. Nat. br. 26. A. Nat. br. 47. J. 13 Edw. 36. Quare non admisit 4. for the Law takes notice of him only as a more publick person concerned. It was brought against the Gardein of the Spi∣ritualties, upon refusal of the Bishop which is dead, Vet. Nat. br. 26. A. Nat. br. 47. J. and well, for he is now in the room of the Bishop. But it was denied against the Archbishops Gar∣dein of the Spiritualties, vivente Archiepiscopo, at videtur. And yet quaere per 17 Edw. 3.27. pl. 9. if the Metropolitan of Common right be not Gardein of the Spiritualties. It seems not since Hen. 8. come. It was maintained against the Official of the Bishop, Nat. br. 47. N. who used, as it seems, to admit Clerks presented.
In what Cases this lies. When a man recovers his presentation, and the Bishop will not admit his Clerk, the party shall have this Writ, Vet. Nat. br. 25. B. Nat. br. 47. C. And this is although the Bishop return cause, why he will not admit the Clerk. 9 Eliz. Dyer 260. pl. 21. Coke 6. part. 52. A. Boswels case; for he must take notice of the Judgments given at the Law in such cases. But if the Record be removed by a Writ of Error, it lies not till Judgment be affirmed, Nat. br. 47. E. for till then it doth not appear the Judgment was duly given, and this Writ doth suppose right Judgment given. The Bishop refuses, and afterward admits him, yet the party it seems shall have this Writ, Nat. br. 47. L. Q. for it seems to little purpose, except it be to recover dammages for not admitting at first. The Writ. 1. It ought to rehearse the Recovery in the Quare Impedit, Nat. br. 47. C. because that is the ground of the Writ. 2. It ought to be brought in the County where the refusal was, because he shall recover nothing but dammages, Vet. Nat. 25. B. Nat. 47. F. Coke 7. part. 3. A. Bulwers case, 38 Hen. 6 14 & 15.39 Edw. 3.2. pl. 5. 29 Hen. 8. Dyer 40. pl. 69. and the dammages can be best enquired and known there.
The Count. The writ was against the Bishop, and counted, though the Vicar general refused, and yet good,  Edw. 3. Quare non admisit 4. Vet. Nat. br. 26.  rid. antea, why so. The King counted not upon what original or t Title he recovered, and yet good, 20 Edw. 3. e non admisit 10. for he is not bound to be  punctual in pleading as a Common person, for ceth if it be good in the substance. The Barr. That he admitted him, and made Letters to  Archdeacon to induct him, a good barr, 38  6.14. Nat. br. 47. H. for this doth disaffirm  Writ. That the Bishop collated by Lapse is a good , Nat. br. 47. M. for by that the Plaintiffs Ti∣s destroyed hac vice. Or that it was litigious by the presentment of anger, 9 Edw. 3. Quare non admisit 12. 34  6. Quare Impedit 89. 34 Hen. 6.41. pl. 10.  also the Ordinary could not know who was to  admitted. But if A and B contend, by reason of which  Bishop collates by Lapse, and after the King overs in a Quare Impedit, this is no barr in a ure non admisit brought by the King, 23 Edw.  12. Quare non admisit 11. for the Kings Title dgne to the collating.
Excommunication cannot be pleaded in the Plaintiff, because the Writ supposeth a contemp in the Ordinary, in that the Plaintiff hath present∣ed his Clerk in the Writ named after Judgment given for him, which supposeth him not Excom∣municated; but a good plea, that the Incumbe did not make request after Judgment, 21 Hen. 7.71. pl. 14. Crooke; for without request the Or∣dinary is not bound to take notice. No such Record is a good plea, Coke 8. part. Dreuries case; viz. as he pretends he hath Judg∣ment upon. A good barr, that the Church was full before the Recovery of one not named in the Recovery, Nat. 47. K. and so the Ordinary had no cause to admit his Clerk. The Bishop returned that the Advowson is seised into the hands of the King, by reason of Wardship, and is so full of the Kings presentment; this is good, 9 Eliz. Dyer. 260. pl. 21. tame Coke 6. part. 52. A. Boswels case, è contra. Q. The Judgment. The Judgment is but to have dammages, Nat. br. 47. G. Quare Incumbravit. In what Court it shall be brought. It is a Writ Original, and therefore it ought to issue out of the Chancery, Nat. br. 48. G. as all O∣riginals do; for the Chancery is Officina brevium.
But it shall be brought in Com. Ban. because it a Common plea, Vet. Nat. br. 26. B. viz. made rnable there. And although the Record be removed out of  Common pleas, Nat. br. 48. F. because it is an ginal Writ, per Shard 17 Edw. 3.55. A. But the King may bring this in Ban. Regis, al∣gh the Record be in Com. Ban. But a Com∣ person shall not. Nat. br. 48. F. 17 Edw. 3.50.  1. for the King may sue in what Court he seth, though a Subject in some cases is con∣ed. What person shall have it. The Plaintiff or Defendant in a Quare Impedit,  Darrein Presentment, that recovers; for by the ecovery it appears they have Title. Against whom it lies. It lies against the Bishop, Vet. Nat. br. A. In what Cases this lies not. It lies not in right of Advowson, Nat. br. 48. Q.  that concerns not the presentation. It lies not unless a Ne Admittas be first directed  the Bishop, a Quare Impedit depending, Vet. t. br. 26. B. Nat. br. 48. H. for by that he is to ake notice of the Suit, which otherwise he is not und to. Yet it was maintained, although no other Writ as first attained, Vet. Nat. br. 27. A. Q.
It lies not, unless the party hath recovered be∣fore by Judgment of the Court, Nat. br. 48.  17 Edw. 3. 50. pl. 21. and so cleared his Ti∣tle. The Incumbring by his Collation ought to b alledged to be within six Months, Nat. br. 48.  for after the six Months there can be no incum∣brance in respect of the Lapse. And if he admit the Clerk of the other per∣son after the six Months, which was presente before the Action, the Writ lies, Nat. br. 48. L. Quaere. The Writ is Original and issueth out of the Chancery only, Nat. br. 48. G. 17 Edw. 3.74. B. vide the Writ Nat. br. 48. O. Regist. orig. 32 A. It ought to be brought in the County where the Church is, because the Clerk of the Bishop shall by this be removed, and the Clerk of the other admitted, Coke 7. part. 3. A. Bulwers case, Nat. br. 48. D. 38 Hen. 6.14. pl. 32 and the wrong is done in the County where the Church is, and that County may have best conusance of the cause. It ought to make mention of the Recovery, Nat. br. 48. K. Regist. orig. 32. B. But 18 Edw. 3.17. by Wilby he ought not to mention it. Quaere. The Writ needs not mention before wha Justices the Recovery was, and yet good; for the Recovery is the substance, and the Court is not ma∣terial, quaere tamen, 18 Edw. 3.17. pl. 19. 17 Edw. 3.74. pl. 109. the Writ; 1. It needs not men∣tion where the Court was, when the Recovery
ad, because it is an Original Writ, and the Court is fixt. 2. Nor that the Bishop Incumbred it within the six Months, for it shall be intended so. 3. It is good, although it bore date within the six Months, for it shall be maintained after the Re∣covery, and the party shall have it. 4. It lies in Cn. Ba. although that the Record be removed, because it is an Original Writ. vid. antea. The Count. The Count ought to mention the Recovery, Nat. br. 48. K. because it is the ground of the A∣ction. It needs not to recite all the Record of the Recovery, although that it was recovered by Darrein Presentment, but the substance of it, 17 Edw. 3.55. pl. 34. The Count mentions, that the Bishop did In∣cumber (the Writ depending) the Church, yet good, 17 Edw. 3.74. pl. 109. If one Writ be abated, the Plaintiff in another Writ may vary from the former Count, Nat. br. 48. M. for he now begins de novo, and is as if he had not counted before. The Process. It is Summons, Attachment, and Distress, Vet. Nat. br. 26. B.
The Barr. The Church was Litigious, and that he did Collate by Lapse, 34 Hen. 6.38. Quare Impedit, 89. a good barr. antea. No such Record a good barr, Vet. Nat. br. 26. B. antea. Error brought, and the Record removed in Ban. Regis, no barr, Vet. Nat. br. 26. B. Q. Did not Incumber after the prohibition of the Court to him delivered, is a good barr, Nat. br. 48. M. for before he was not bound to take notice of the Suit. The Judgment. It is to have his Presentment and his Dam∣mages, Nat. br. 48. H. 38. Hen. 6.14. Coke 7. part. 3. A. Bulwers case, 21 Edw. 3.3. pl. 7. If the Plaintiff be Nonsuited, yet it is not to him peremptory, Nat. br. 48. M. but he may com∣mence a new Action; for he may be Nonfuit, and yet have a good Title.
Replevin. In what Court it lies. IN the County Court by plaint, per le Stat. dé Marlebridge, cap. 21. And this may be before the day of the Court, 9 Edw. 4.48. 21 Edw. 4.66. pl. 46. For the conveniency of the people. But by the Common Law the Sheriff cannot make a Replevin without a Writ, 8 Eliz. Dyer. 256. pl. 67. viz. out of the Chancery. In the 5 Ports, Regist. Orig. 79. A. Nat. br. 67. A. By special priviledge. In a Court-Baron by plaint, but this ought to be entred Sedente Curia, 21 Edw. 4.66. pl. 46. In Ban. Regis, or Com. Ban. An ancient Demean is a good plea to out the Court of jurisdiction, because the reality may come in debate upon the Replevin, which ought to be tried there, Coke 5. part 105. Aldens case, tide 2 Edw. 3.32. pl. 10. 17 Edw. 3.52. pl. 28. & fol. 75. 40 Edw. 3.4. pl. 9. 29 Edw. 3.9. pl. 29. 4 Edw. 3.123. pl. 34.
It lies not in the Marshalsey, Coke 10. part. 74. Marshalsey. For that is a limited Court, and holds not plea of all Actions. Who shall have a Replevin. Admini∣strator.Administrator shall have a Replevin de bonis Testatoris, vid. the Count. Lib. Intra. 560. B. sect. 2. for the benefit of the Intestates Estate. Husband and Wife.Husband and Wise join in a Replevin for a Di∣stress taken upon the Land of the Wife, 2 Edw. 2. Replevin 42. Digest. brevium. 53. sect. 2. For they are both concerned, the Husband in right of his Wife, and the Wife in her own right. But for goods of the Wife sole taken, which takes a Husband, the Husband alone shall bring the Action, Nat. br. 69. K. 33. Edw. 3. Repleg. 43. For by the Marriage the Goods and right to them are his. If Goods be bayled to A,Baylee. he shall have a Re∣plevin of them against a stranger, 21 Hen. 7.14. For he hath a property in them against all the world, but against the Bailor. An Executor shall have it for Goods taken in the Testators time,Executor. 17 Edw. 3. Executors, 106. 24 Edw. 3. Avowry, 257. 21 Hen. 6.1. B. Markham. For the right and title to the Goods is come unto him by the Executorship. Executors shall have it for the Goods in their hands that were the Testators. Regist. Orig. 81.

And when he brings it of his own possession, he shall have it before the Probat of the Testa∣ment, Com. 281. A. in regard of the property which is in him thereby. Joint-Tenant or Tenant in Common may join in a Replevin,Joint-Te∣nant, or Tenane in Common, 11 Hen. 6.31. in respect of their joint interest. But if two others join, the Writ shall abate, 11 Hen. 6.31. 3 Hen. 4.16. 21 Edw. 4.23. For one Writ cannot try distinct interests, but there must be several Writs. But in a Homine Repleg. strangers may join, Nat. 66. F. 8 Edw. 4.16. pl. 19. Propter favorem libertatis, and yet 8 Hen. 4.2. is, that they shall not join. Q. Ergo. It seems needless for two to join, because the Writ may be as well prosecuted by one. Parson shall have a Replevin of a Mortuary af∣ter Seisure,Parson. but not before, Com. 281. A.

So if one have Goods bayled to him, 21 Hen. 7.14. viz. to keep, or to bail over as it seems. Q. The Lord of a Villain shall have it for Cattel of a Villain taken,Lord. for the bringing of the Action is a sufficient claim of the Cattel, and there needs no seisure, 42 Edw. 3.18. 33 Edw. 1.3.

Yet if he be non-suited in the County-Court, and it be removed in Ban. then it shall issue out of the Ban. 13 Edw. 3. Repleg. 37. For there the Cause is now depending. And if he be non-suited in the Second Deli∣rance, he shall not have another Writ, 4 Hen. 6.8. Return of Cattel, 6. viz. of Second Deli∣rerance; for this is final.

For a Cow and a Heifer non variant specie; for they differ only in age and appellation. Upon a Non-suit in Repleg. return awarded, and upon Withernam awarded, and other Cattel taken, yet the second deliverance shall be of the former Cattel; for so the Writ imports, 36 Hen. 1. Dyer 59. pl. 14. 2 Edw. 3.17. Avowry 171. 22 Hen. 7.92. pl. 7 Crooke, there shall not be a second deliverance, because the Plaintiff had estray∣ed the former.

It seems he may; for he comes in upon a good Title. A man may distrain dammage feasant, although the owner make fresh suit, in respect of his satis∣faction for the dammage done, 7 Hn. 7.1. pl. 11. 11 Hen. 7.4. pl. 11. 10 Hen. 7.21.

A man fined in a Leet, being one of the Dezi∣ners,Leet. shall be distrained through all the jurisdicti∣on of the Leet, although that he be of another dezin, Coke 11. part. 45. A. 11 Hen. 4.89. 13 Hen. 4.9. For he may, it seems, be liable in both places. Tourne of the SheriffA man shall distrain in any place within the precinct of the Court, 19 Edw. 3.2. Avowry 225. 8 Rich. 2. Avowry 194. 47 Edw. 3. pl. 12. where the Amerciament is set, but not without; for there is no jurisdiction. For Amerciament in the Sheriffs Tourne he may distrain throughout the County, 12 Hen. 4.24. pl. 17. 13 Hen. 4.9. 8. Rich. 2. Avowry 194. because all the County is within the jurisdiction of the Sheriffs turn; for it is the County-Court. If a man had a Leet within his Mannor, he can∣not distrain out of his Mannor, 4 Edw. 3 96. pl. 26. For that is not within his jurisdiction. For a tax by the ParliamentFor a Tax by the Parliament, a distress may be
justified throughout all the Village, 11 Hen. 4.2. 18 Edw. 3.11. pl. 39. upon which the Tax is set. This was according to the old way; but now the Law is altered. A Fishing lying within tenure, a man may di∣strain in it,For Ser∣vice. for it seems that the Soil passeth, 40 Edw. 3.45. as well as the water, viz. terra aqua cooperta. Q. For a Fishing seems but a Liberty or Priviledge. Herriot-service.A man may seize his Herriot-service in any place that he shall find him, although not within his Fee, 6 Edw. 3.208. pl. 3. For it is a personal service, and not local or fixt. The Lord may enter the House of his Tenant to distrain if the Door be open,House. 38 Hen. 6. 26 pl. 4. But he cannot open the Door to do it. Q. If the Lord find the House fast with a Bar, and he break it open and distrain, this is wrongfully done, 8 Edw. 2. Distress 21. For a mans House is his Castle of defence. If the Beasts of a stranger escape into anothers Land,Estranger. and the Owner chases them out before, and the Lord comes and distrains them, here the Lord cannot distrain them; yet it is otherwise, if they go out▪ of their own accord, without chasing, 11 Hen. 7.4. pl. 11 Com. 38. A. Plats case. 2 Edw. 4.6. B. Littleton. 33 Hen. 6.52. pl. 39. 34 Hen. 6.18. B. For in the former case he may take notice of the Owner, but in the latter case he cannot. The Lord distrains the Cattel of the Patron within the Glebe belonging to the Advowson,Glebe. 33 Hen. 6.35. Littleton. This is a good distress held. A man cannot distrain for Rent but in the place leasd,Lessee. unless the Lessee grant a distress in other
Land, 9 Hen. 6.9. which he may well do by spe∣cial agreement. Lords Ecc.The Lord distrains in his Fee, the Tenant chases them out of his Fee, he may take them a∣gain, 44 Edw. 3.20. pl. 18. for by the distress he had a property. Fresh suit.A Baily attaches a Horse, which is rescued and brought into another County, he shall make fresh sit, and take him again, 33 Hen. 6.52. pl. 39. 33 Hen. 6.550. pl. 46. else not; for the gaining him upon the fresh suit re-continues the Attach∣ment. A distrains and puts them in the pound,Pound. the Owner takes them out, A may take them again in any place, 34 Hen. 6.18. pl. 33. because they were once in custody of the Law, and he may place them there again wherever he finds them. If one put his Cattel in Land charged with a Rent-charge,Rent-charge. they shall be distrained for the Rent-charge, although they are neither Levant nor Couchant: otherwise, if they escape upon the Land, 15 Hen. 7.17. pl. 13. for it shall be pre∣fumed he took notice of the Rent; but not so where the Beasts escape there, for that is against his will, and he could not help it.

Assize pl. 50. this is in respect of the great consequence of the thing distrained for, and the easiness for the Te∣nant to perform it. So likewise for fealty, 27. Assize, pl. 51. 28 Assira, pl. 50. Coke 4. part. 8. Bevils case, for the same reason, and in respect of the contempt done to the Lord. A man distrains four Horses and a Cart for two shillings rent; this is not excessive, because they are fixed to the Cart; otherwise, if not fixed: so of a fold of Sheep, 20 Edw. 4.3. otherwise, if not in the fold. Quaere rationem differentia. It seems to be, because in the former cases the intent of the party appears, but only to have his due, and not to take advantage of the Distress: But not
in the latter, for then he might have distrained  Horse, or one Sheep. 1. The Barr. 2. Justification. 3. Conusance. 4. Avowry. No Barr that the Plantiff is possessed of the tel, Nat. br. 69.

In Replevin of grain it is a good Barr to say,Grain.  was his Wises dum sola, and that the Plaintiff endred it to her, 30 Edw. 3.9. pl. 3. for by the arriage the interest is his. 2. Justifi∣cation. Difference between a Justificati∣on and an Avowry.When a man cannot have the thing for which  distrains, then he may justifie the taking in lieu  the thing, and not avow to keep it till he have  thing it self, per Curiam, 19 Hen. 6.41.83.

Because he cannot have a return for the same thing against the Executors, 22 Edw. 4.36. B. Collow. If a man distrain for Services, he may justifie or avow at his Election, 15 Edw. 4.29. In every case where he may avow, he may justi∣fie, for he hath done no wrong: sed non è contra, 5 Edw. 4.6. Young; for he may have done no wrong in taking, and yet may not be able to maintain an Avowry. A man may justifie for Rent determined, but not avow, viz. for Rent arrear before it was de∣termined, Mich. 33 & 34 Eliz. Com. Ban. God∣dards case; because he cannot make a Title. Tenant at sufferance may justifie a distress for dammage fasant, 4 Hen. 7.3. pl. 6. for he hath a Title against a Stranger.

A Tenant to a Lord makes a Feoffment, and after notice to the Lord gives seisin to the Lord; this is good, because he remains Tenant to the Lord until notice be given, Coke 6. part. 58. A.

Within what time seisin ought to be alledged. The Advowant is not bound to alledge seisin within 40 years, but may alledge it generally, and then the other may plead that he was not seised within 40 years, Coke 8. part. 65. A. Fosters case, 9. part. 36. A. Bucknalls case, 14 Eliz. Dyer 315. pl. 10. and that will destroy the seisin, if it be so. When it is not requisite to alledge Seisin. In an Avowry for an amerciament it is not re∣quisite to alledge it,Avowry. 11 Hen. 4.89. 13 Hen. 4.9. In an Avowry for a Rent-charge, 44 Edw. 3. Avowry. 75. Coke 8. part. 56. A. Fosters case, it is necessary; for if he were never seised the rent was not executed. In an Avowry for rent upon a seoffment by deed Seisin is not necessary to be alledged, because the deed is the Title, and the commencement of it appears by it, 2 Edw. 2. Avowry 185. Coke 8. part. 65. A. Fosters case. So for Rent or Service upon a gift in Tail, or other particular estate, Coke 8. part. 65. A. Fosters case, created by deed. What Seisin shall be good. Seisin of the superiour Service is seisin of all inferiours,Superiour. because they are incident to it, Coke 4. part. 8. Bevils case, and included as it were in it. For Example, seisin of Esuage is seisin of Homage, Coke 4. part. 8.
Seisin of Homage is seisin of Fealty, Coke 4. part. 8. Seisin of Homage is seisin of the Superiour or inferiour.Inferiour. For Example, seisin of Homage is seisin of Escuage the superiour, 13 Edw. 4.5. and is seisin of Relief, the inferiour service, 13 Edw. 4.5.

Seisin of Annual service is seisin of every Ca∣sual service, Coke 4. part. 8, 9. Bevills case, 20 Edw. 3. Avowry 121.76. B. Avowry 69. for the certain comprehends the incertain. Seisin of rent is seisin of fealty, 29 Edw. 3.21. A. 3 Edw. 2. Avowry 188. for fealty is incident unto it. Seisin of one Annual service is not seisin of a∣nother Annual service, because it is the folly of the Lord that he did not obtain that which is annual, Coke 4. part. 9. A. Bevills case, 16 Eliz. Dyer 330. Q Reservation the former year one Rose, and af∣terwards 20 s.per annum, the seisin of the one gives the seisin of the other, Coke 4. part. 9. Bevills case; for they depend one upon another, and hang together like links of a Chain. The Lord recovers dammage for Suit; this is a good seisin of the Suit, Coke 4. part. A. Bevills case; for the dammage comes in room of the suit, and shew it was due. Note that a seisin in Law is sufficient seisin within the Statute of 35 Hen. 8. cap. 2.1. because the intent of the makers was to limit the time,
and not to exclude any seisin that was at Common Law; 2. the words being (possession or seisin) in the disjunctive, make an actual seisin, which re∣ferrs to the three former branches, and seisin; this is either actual or in Law, which referrs to the fourth branch, Coke 4. part. 10.

G. because then the party is put to more loss and trouble. If there be tender of amends after distress, and afore impounding, the detainer is wrongful and not the distress, Coke 8. part. 147. A. Carpenters case. Q. for it seems the detainer is not wrongful, except he tender amends as well for his trouble and expences, as for the dammage done by the Cattel. The tender of amends to the Baily is not good, Coke 5. part. 76 A. Pilkingtons case, 1 Hen. 4.15. pl. 17. for he hath not power to take it, for this belongs not to him as a Baily. A claims Common appurtenant to such a house pro omnibus averiis magnis,Common. and a verdict given
for him; and it was resolved after verdict, that although he doth not say (suis) it is good; . although he said not Common appurtenant, Pasch. 15. Jac. Ban. Regis, for both shall be so in∣tended.

Grant by Tenant in tail.Avowry, because A seised in see granted a tent to the Avowant, for which he distrains, the other pleads that A was seised in t; this is not good, if he traverse not the seisin in see, 11 Eliz. Dyer 280. pl. 16. for he might be seised also in see in remainder. Out of his Fee.Out of his see is a good Barr, and every Stran∣ger to the Avowry shall plead it, Coke 9. part. 20. A. 34. 15 Rich. 2. Avowry; for then the party cannot distrain there. Note, Feodum dum homagium, & servitium,Note. & non tenementum in dominico, Bracton lib. 2. fol. 46. B. Q. I suppose the meaning is, that there is see, wheresoever homage or services are due. If one avow, the other need not say he took them in the high Street, but is put to his Action upon the Statute, 11 Rich 2. Avowry 87. which hinders the taking of such distresses. Injuria sua propria.In an Avowry for an Amerciament affered in Court Baron de injuria sua propria, is a good barr, for the Custome is traversed by that plea, Mich. 13 Jac. Com. Ban. Baker & Banks. Ought to in lose and did not.The Plaintiff says, that the Defendant ought to have inclosed, and did not do it sufficiently; ride the pleadings, 22 Eliz. Dyer 365. pl. 32. and that which is not sufficiently done is, as if it were not done at all.
Coparce∣ner.Conusance for dammage feasant, the other said that they are Coparceners; this is good, 10 & 11 Eliz. Dyer 280. pl. 15. for he is seized per my & per tout in all the Land, and therefore can∣not be a Trespasser. Nothing in arrear.Nothing in arrear a good barr; but no Stran∣ger shall plead it, Coke 9. part. 20. A. viz. upon a distress for rent or services. A release of Actions personals and reals plead∣ed in barr of the Avowry for a corrody granted with a distress,Release. a good barr, 27 Edw. 3.81. pl. 13. for the distress is in the nature of an A∣ction. When the Lord varies from the truth of the quantity of his services by reason of seisin,Seisin. there the Defendant cannot traverse the seisin, Coke 9. part. 33. A. Com. 94. B. Mantels case, for the vari∣ance destroys not the seisin. But if they differ of the quantity by reason of seisin had, there the seisin is traversable, Coke 9. part. 33. A. Bucknals case, Com. 94. B. Mantels case, 18 Edw. 2. Avowry 217. for the seisin is the chief thing in question. Not seised generally is a good barr, for by this he shall have no remedy of the Lord,Not seised. Coke 9. part. 34. B. Bucknals case, 22 Hen. 6.3 A. 30 Hen. 6. Avowry 15. but he shall only retain the di∣stress. Q. for he shall have dammages. But if the Lord avow and alledge seisin by the hands of the Plaintiff or other person, the Plain∣tiff shall say, never seised by his hands, Coke 9. part. 35. A. Bucknals case, 22 Hen. 6.3. A. and this is a good barr, for here is a good issue ten∣dered.
The seisin is not traversable, but for that only for which the Avowry is made, Coke 9 part. 35. A. Bucknals case, 26 Hen. 8.1. pl. 1. unless seisin be alledged of a superiour service, as if tenure be alledged per Homage, fealty, and rent, and the Avowry is for rent, and seisin is alledged in all, the seisin of the rent is only traversable, Coke 9. part. 34. A. because the Avowry is only for the rent. But if it be of Homage, Fealty, Rent, and Es∣cuage, and the Avowry is for Homage, and he alledgeth seisin in all, there the seisin of Escuage is traversable, because this is seisin of all, Coke 9. part. 34. A. Bucknals case, 21 Edw. 3.52. 13 Edw. 3. Avowry 103.19 Edw. 2. Avowry 224.16 Edw. 4.11. pl. 11. for Escuage includes all the rest. Tenure by Homage, Fealty, or Escuage, or Suit of Court and other services, and seisin is alledged of all, he may traverse the seisin of Homage and Escuage, 2 Edw. 3.21. pl. 4. because they include the rest. Not seised within 40 years.Not seised within 40 years is a good barr, 32 Hen. 8. cap. 2. Coke 9. part. 36. Bucknals case, 14 Eliz. Dyer 315. pl. 101. for it is not likely; if he had any right, there would have been no seisin in so long time. But he that pleads this, ought first to confess a tenure, to the intent that the Lord may have a Writ of Customes and Services, 15 Rich. 2. Avow∣ry 214. Coke 9. part. 34. B. Bucknals case. It seems the pleading so doth impliedly confess a tenure, or at least doth not deny it.
But this is no plea in an Avowry for rent upon a grant or reservation by deed, because the deed makes the Title, Coke 8. part. 65. A. Fosters case, and not the seisin. Or upon a gift in Tail, because the commence∣ment of the Estate is within the time of memo∣ry, Coke 8. part. 64. A. Fosters case, 4. part. 11. A. Bevills case. Or if it be for casual services, as homage, fealty, or to go to war, because perchance it may not happen within 40 years, Coke 4. part. 10.11. Be∣vills case, and so there could be no seisin of it. So if the Lord release to the Tenant so long as A hath heirs of his body, because A may have heirs a long time after, Coke 4. part. 11. A. Bevilis case. So if Land be conveyed to a Major and Com∣monality, which was held by homage and fealty, which conveys this over; this is no plea, because the Major and Commonalty cannot do homage or fealty, Coke 4. part. 11. A. Bevills case; for that must be done by one single person, and not by a body politick consisting of multitudes. Note, 1. The Issue in tail shall avoid seisin by the hands of the Tenant in tail,Seisin a∣voided in Avowry. Coke 9. part. 34. A. Bucknalls case, 34 Edw. 3. Avowry 131. for he comes in by the Donor. But this is intended when the Tenant of the Lord makes a gift in Tail, the remainder in Fee; for the Tenant in tail shall himself avoid the en∣croachment and seisin made between by the Do∣nor, because he ought to shew the commencement of the reservation, Coke 8. part. 65. A. Fosters case, 10. part. 108. Lofields case.
2. Successor of a Bishop shall avoid seisin be∣en by the hands of the predecessor, Coke 9. . 34. A. for the predecessors act shall not bind im. 3. Veray Tenant of the land, if he have deed od shew the contrary, Coke 9. part. 34. A. 10 Hen. .11. Nat. br. 163. C. 22 Hen. 6.5. 4 Edw. 2. vry 201, 202. shall avoid seisin. 4. Encroachment of seisin is not material, there is no tenure, Coke 9. part. 34. B. Bucknalls se; for the tenure is the ground of the seisin. 5. Such seisin shall be avoided, because it was  coercion of distress, Coke 9. part. 34. B. Buck∣nll case, 12 Edw. 4.7. pl. 18. 8 Hen. 6.18. pl. 1.  Edw. 3.4. pl. 8. and not voluntarily rendred,  is in the nature of a thing obtained by Duress. 6. If rent be payable at one day in a year, and the Lord encroacheth seisin upon two days of the year; this being involuntary, yet shall be avoided is an Avowry for this, that they agree in the ual sum, Coke 9. part. 34. B. Bucknalls case, ide 21 Edw. 4.64. pl. 36, & fol. 84. pl. 39. and the me is only in question, and the Lord is not lessen∣ed in the rent.Tenure. In an Avowry the seisin is traversable, and not the tenure, Crooke 13 Hen. 7.31. B. for without seisin the Avowry is not issuable. 1. When the Lord varies in avowing of the erity of the quantity of the services by colour of seisin, the tenure shall be traversed, Coke 9. part. 33. A. Bucknals case, 10 Hen. 7.11. pl. 31. Com 94. Mantels case, Crooke 13 Hen. 7.31. B. iz. he may say, that he holds not by so much nt, or so many services.
But then the Tenant ought to confess the Te∣nure in part, for he needs not traverse all the tenure, as to say that he holds not of him; but he may disclaim or plead out of his fee, Coke 9. part. 35. A. Bucknals case, 10 Hen. 6.6, 7. pl. 20. 37 Hen. 6.25. pl. 13. 15 Rich. 2. Avow∣ry 214. as to part. But note 11 Hen. 4.10. pl. 22. the Tenant said, that the Avowant did give the Lordship to A in tail, the remainder to B in tail, and that A died without issue, B yet living; there he needs not suffer a Disclaimer, or plead out of his fee, but there fol. 7. pl. 40. he had judgment of the A∣vowry, and admitted good. 2. When they agree in the quantity of the Services, and vary in the quantity of the Land; there the Plaintiff may traverse absque hoc, that he held modo & forma, or say that he held one Acre only, Coke 9. part. 35. B. Bucknals case, 20 Hen. 6.20, & 21. And so one may avow severally where it is a joynt Tenure, or to the contrary, Coke 9. part. 35. B. Bucknals case, 9 Hen. 6.26. pl. 24. 2. Edw. 3.34. pl. 19. But if he vary in the quantity of the Land and of the Services, he may not confess the Te∣nure according to the verity of the case, but may traverse mode & forma, or say he held one only, Coke 9. part. 35. A, & B. Bucknals case, 5 Hen 5.4. 3. When one distrains for fealty, rent, and suit of Court, and alledges seisin in all, and avows for rent, the Tenant may confess that he held by fealty and rent, and plead as to the rent nothing arrear, without that that he held by fealty, rent,
nd suit, modo & forma, as is alledged, and good; d if upon Issue joyned it be found, that he eld by fealty and rent, and not suit, although that he Avowry be for rent, yet insomuch that the tenure alledged by the Avowant was traversed and found against him, Judgment shall be given against the Avowant, for in vain shall he make this traversable, and yet that he should have the return when it is found against him, Coke 9. part. 35, & 36. Bucknals case. Tender of Homage ought to be to the person of the Lord,Tender. ubicunque fuerit infra regnum pro∣per reverentiam, Bracton lib. 2. fol. 80. A. quaere. for this may be prejudicial to the Tenant. Judgment. If the Plaintiff counts upon a Detainer, and the Defendant appears and makes default, the other shall have Judgment for dammages and costs, and also for the value of the Cattel, Nat. br. 69. L. No. Lib. Intra. 610. C. Sect. 20. for by the default he confesseth the tort. Retorno ha∣bendo Null. 1. The Defendant said that the place is ancient demesn, &c. if the issue be found for him the Plaintiff shall not have a return, 21 Edw. 3.7. pl. 18. 2. If one justifies for Services and makes no Avowry, he shall not have a return, although it be found for him, 15 Edw. 4.29. 5 Edw. 4.6. 34 Hen. 6. Avowry 47. for there is difference be∣twixt Avowing and Justifying; Avowing sup∣poseth tenure, but Justifying doth not.
If one make a Conusance as Bailiff, he shall have a return, No. Lib. Intra. 591. A. sect. 9. viz. for his Master. 3. The Plaintiff in a Recaption dies, the Lord shall have return, if another Writ be purchased, 11 Hen. 6.14. pl. 3. Q. If the Plaintiff be Nonsuited,Returno habendo. the other shall have a return, Lib. Intra. 570. D. sect. 1, 2. 11 Eliz. Dyer 280. pl. 14. 35 Hen. 6.47. pl. 12. 17 Hen. 8. br. second Deliverance 15. 22 Hen. 7.92. pl. 7. Crooke; and this, although the other do make no Avowry, 16 Hen. 6. return of Cat∣tel 1. 2 Hen. 5.6. for the Nonsuit confesseth the Distress well taken, and so the Avowry is need∣less. But otherways he may abate the Writ, by pleading 9 Hen. 6.4. pl. 10. 11 Hen. 6.5. B. Dan∣by, 35 Hen. 6.40. pl. 1. But if the Count abate, or if he count not of the place of the taking, yet he shall not have a return before an Avowry, 35 Hen. 6.40. pl. 1. because that is but for want of good pleading, and he may have just cause of com∣plaint, notwithstanding for ought that appears to the Court. The second Deliverance, he shall not have it without Avowry, per Newton, 16 Hen. 6. re∣turn of Cattel 1. for it is grounded upon a Title shewn. The Defendant cannot claim a property in Re∣pleg. to have a return, because he ought to claim at the time of the Repleg. sued, 31 Hen. 6.12. pl. 1. and now it is too late.
The Plaint is removed, and it abates for default of the Sirname, there was a return awarded without an Avowry, 27 Hen. 6.3. pl. 35. for here is no right party complained of. Repleg. against C and D, C pleads he took them not, D justifies in right of C, and found for him; yet he shall not have a return, 22 Hen. 6.52. pl. 27. because he justifies in the right of another, who disclaims the distress. The Defendant pleads property in another, and found so; there he shall have a return without an Avowry, for the Plaintiff had deliverance without cause, 39 Hen. 6.35. pl. 47. Prisott, be∣cause the Cattel belonged to another. One avows for rent at two days, one whereof is not come, the Plaintiff is Nonsuited; there shall be a return in respect of the rent due for one day, because he is not meerly an Actor, per 4. Justices against three. But Newton said, he ought to have several A∣vowries. Q. At the Common Law a return irreplevisable was but when it was found against the Plaintiff,1. Return ir∣replevisa∣ble, 1. At Common Law. 2. At the Statute Law. by an issue tried, 36 Hen. 6.8. pl. 24. Babbington, for then the matter was fully tried. If the Defendant doth not answer to the A∣vowry, there the Cattel shall be irreplevisable, Lib. Intra. 571. A. sect. 4. for he thereby con∣fesseth the distress lawful.2. Return irreplevisable after Westm. 2. cap. 2. is but upon a Nonsuit in second Deliverance, 2 Hen. 4.23. pl. 9. Lib. Intra. 571. A. sect. 4, 5. Upon a Nonsuit in Repleg. it shall not be, 24 Edw. 3.33. pl. 22. if it be not after verdict,
14 Hen. 7.6. pl. 14. for he may have just cause of complaint though he be Nonsuit; but by the ver∣dict it appears he had not. If the Plaintiff be Nonsuited in a Replevin, and after in a second deliverance, there shall be a return irreplevisable before Avowry; but quaere, if he shall have dammages before Avowry, 10 Eliz. Dyer 280. pl. 14. It seems he shall, for this double Nonsuit admits the taking lawful. If the Plaintiff be Nonsuited when the Jury comes again and gives their verdict, yet there shall not be a return irreplevisable, 34 Hen. 6.5. pl. 14. 14 Hen. 7.6. pl. 14. for it may be he hath better evidence, which he then failed of. The Plaintiff in Repleg. makes default at the Nisi prius, they shall not be irreplevisable, be∣cause it is out of the Law, 3 Hen. 6.8. pl. 24. The Plaintiff in a Repleg. is Nonsuited, and a return awarded, the King demises, the pledges being warned come not; quaere, if the return shall be irreplevisable, 1 Edw. 7. pl. 13. Or upon a Return awarded in second delive∣rance, 2 Hen. 4.23. pl. 9. Q. Or upon a judgment against the Plaintiff upon a Demurrer, 2 Hen. 4.23. pl. 9. 14. Hen. 7.6. pl. 14.2, & 3 Mariae, Dyer 118. pl. 77. Q. Upon a Demurrer upon a plea to the Writ, and judgment for the Defendant, they shall not be irreplevisable, 34 Hen. 6.37. B. br. Repleg. 6. for that is not upon the merits of the cause. Or upon issue tried, 2 Hen. 23. pl. 9. the Defendant in a Repleg. pleads to the Writ, and found by the Jury so, there shall be a return ir∣replevisable, the contrary upon a Demurrer up∣on
a Writ or Concession, 34 Hen. 6.37. B. br. Re∣pleg. 6. for a verdict is of a higher account than a Demurrer or Concession. If the Plaintiff upon a second Deliverance suf∣fer the plea to be discontinued, there it shall be irreplevisable, 17 Hen. br. second Deliverance; for the Court will not be troubled with Suits to no purpose. Dammages by Sta∣tutes.Note, that at this day dammages are given where the Plaintiff is Nonsuited, or found against him. or otherwise barred in Conusance, Avowry, or Justification, for Rents, Customes, or Services, per 7 Hen. 8. cap. 4. com. 82. B. Crokers case, 14 Mariae Dyer 141. pl. 46. 19 Hen. 8.11. pl. 7. And for dammage feasant, per 21 Hen. 8. cap. 19.1, & 3 Mariae, Dyer 118. pl. 77. 4 Mariae, Dyer 141. pl. 46. But if it be for an Estray he shall not have dam∣mages, because the Statute extends not to it, asch. 34 Eliz. Ban. Regis, Rot. 292. and being penal, it shall not be expounded by equity. But at the Common Law the Avowant shall not recover dammages, 35 Hen. 6. pl. 12. for it was though enough for him to have return of the distress. If one have a return irreplevisable upon a Non∣suit in second deliverance, it is doubted whether he shall have dammages before Avowry, 11 Eliz. Dyer 280. pl. 14. It seems he shall, because there needs no Avowry. Quaere tamen, for it appears not to the Court, that he had cause to distrain.

Trespass. In what Court Trespass lies. County Court.IN the County Court; but then it shall not say vi & armis, Nat. br. 85. G. neither against the peace, because the Sheriff cannot determine it, Regist. 92. A. for that Court is not to meddle with criminal matters. Note, Regist. orig. 111. B. Trespass vi & armis,Note. shall not be sued in any Court but the Kings, or before his Justices, if otherways a Supersedeas shall be awarded, Coke 8. part. 120. A. for he is the proper Judge of such matters, as the chief conservator of the Peace. In the Marshalsey,Marshal∣sey. if the party be of the Hou∣shold, Trespass lies; but then it shall say vi & ar∣mis, for battery or carrying away of goods, and no other causes, Coke 10. part. 72. A. which in∣deed are rather civil than criminal causes. For it shall not be Quare clausum fregit, Coke 10. part. 76. A. which is of a higher nature, and may concern title of Land. It lies in Chancery for one priviledged there,Chancery. Regist. orig. 104. A. No. Lib. Intra. 678. B. sect. 20. in respect of his attendance required there. And there shall be an Alias, &c. Regist. 104. A. It lies in Com. Ban. or Ban. Regis, Nat. br. 86. G. for these are high Courts of Record.Com. Ban. Regis.
Ancient Demean.If Trespass be brought in the Court of the King, where the reality shall come in debate, An∣cient Demean is a good plea, because the Title ought to be tried there, Coke 5. part. 105. as in trespass for Trees, where the Defendant claims Franktenement in the land where the Trees grew, 6 Hen. 4.1. pl. 6. otherwise it is no plea, 46 Edw. 3.1. pl. 2. because the Action is personal, which may be any where sued. In Trespass for a Pigeon-house with Pigeons, it is no plea, 47 Edw. 3.22. pl. 54. viz. Ancient demesn, because the Action is chiefly in respect of the Pigeons. So in Trespass upon the Case, 5 Rich. 2. cap. 7. because dammages are only to be recovered, 21 Edw. 4.3. 2 Hen. 7.17. pl. 1. 47 Edw. 3.22. pl. 54. 46 Edw. 3.1.▪ pl. 2. which are personal. And note,Note▪ none may plead this, but the Ter∣tenant of the Land in Ancient demn, 2 Hen. 7.17. pl. 1. and that in respect of his service to be done to the Lord there. Trespass in the Five Ports, the Writ is, Dilecto & fideli suo W. Constabular. Castri sui de D. & Custodi quinque Portuum suor. salutem.

Who shall have Trespass. Note, that he that taketh only the profit of the soil of anothers Land, shall not have a Tres∣pass Quare clausum fregit, 15 Hen. 7. 14 Hen. 8. because he hath no interest in the soil. He that hath certain Acres of land annuatim, shall have Trespass, for he hath a term in those Acres of land. An Administrator shall have Trespass for goods of the Intestates taken out of the possession of the Administrator,Admini∣strator. Regist. orig. 94. A. 22 Edw. 4.120. pl. 32. the Count, Lib. Intra. 649. D. Sect. 1. for he hath a property in them ratione Admini∣strationis. An Administrator shall have Trespass for goods taken out of the possession of the Intestate, in respect of his interest in them, Nat.br. 92. A. 14 Hen. 7.13. Tremaile, the Count, Lib. Intra. 640. A. Sect. 1. An Executor shall have it,Executor. per the Stat. of 4 Edw. 3. cap. 6. and the Statute of 31 Edw. 3. gives the same remedy to an Administrator; but this is by the equity of the Statute, 4 Edw. 3. cap. 7. Crooke 24 Hen. 7.101. B. pl. 2. An Administrator shall have an Action of Trespass before the Administration committed to him;Admini∣strator. but not against him that justifies under the Ordinary, for he was Administrator pro tempore, 18 Hen. 6.22. pl. 7. 36 Hen. 6.8. A Prisot, Register Original 102. B. that is, for goods taken before the Administration granted.
But if the Administration be committed by word to A, who sells goods to B, and dies, and the Administration is committed to C; quaere, if C shall have Trespass for the goods sold: It seems not, for A had authority, as it seems, to sell. An alien Friend shall have all Actions perso∣nals,Alien. 6 Hen. 8. Dyer pl. 8. Coke 7. part. 17. A. ratione commorantiae by the Law of Nations, which the Common Law maintains. But an alien Enemy shall have no Action, 6 Hen. 8. Dyer 2. pl. 8. Coke 7. part. 17. A. 14 Hen. 8.4. for it is not reason, that he that wishes ill to the Nation where he lives, should have the pro∣tection of their Laws. Husband and wife.Husband and wife Executrix to B joyn in Trespass for taking the Goods during coverture, 21 Edw. 4.5. per Littleton, and good, in respect of the Husbands interest in right of his wife, viz. in taking her goods. In a Trespass done to the wife sole, who takes a Husband, they shall have Trespass in both their names, Nat. br. 87 H. Regist. orig. 95. A. for the dammages do concern the Husband, 21 Hen. 6.30. pl. 16. Lib. Intr. 6.50. C. Sect. 3. and the Count shall be bona & catalla of the wife, 7 Hen. 7.2. vide 14 Eliz. Dyer 305. pl. 59. the Count, Lib. Intra. 650. C. Sect. 3. Husband and wife may joyn in Trespass for the beating of the wife, 46 Edw. 3.3. pl. 5. 22 Assize 60, & 87. Regist. 105. B. Lib. Intra. 612, & 668. C. Sect. 4. for he is damnified by it, as well as his wife, viz. by losing his labour and society.
So for imprisonment of the Wife, Coke 5. part 59. A. Fosters case, for the same reason. But if they joyn for battery of both, this a∣bates for the battery of the Husband, 9 Edw. 4.54. 3 Edw. 3. brev. 737. For the battery of the Husband is not the battery of the Wife; and so as to that, she hath no cause of Action. And if they brought a Trespass for beating and taking away of Goods during the coverture, thé Writ shall say de bonis of the Husband; for the Wife cannot have a property during the coverture, Regist. orig. 105. B. And if the Husband and Wife are beaten, they shall have several Actions, Regist. orig. 105. in the Note, quia transgressio personalis ought to be brought only by the person injured. Trespass quare domum suam fregit, & maremium iude asportavit, &c. being the house of the Wife, is good by the Husband alone, because he may pull it down and sell it, 43 Edw. 3.16. pl. 15 & fol. 26. pl. 6. Q. It seems so, because he cannot be sued for it during the coverture. So for entring and chasing and carrying a∣way of the Deer in a Park, although the Wife had a joint Estate with her Husband, yet it is a personal thing in the Husband, 43 Edw. 3.8. pl. 23. So for Deeds concerning the Land of the Wife, 8 Hen. 5.9. pl. 13. For Deeds are Chattels, though they concern the Realty.

It seems this Statute was but in affirmance of the common Law. Quando breve fertur ab aliquibus ad liberum te∣nementum annexis fiat in nomine amborum,Nota. sed si sit de rebus libero tenemento non annexis in no∣mine viri tantum, sed si sit de domo fracta sit in nomine amborum, sed alii Clerici dicunt quod fiat in nomine viri tantum, Regist. orig. 108. B. This is when trespass is brought concerning House and Lands of the Wife being covert. Vide tamen in nomine amborum de clauso fracto & bona, &c. Lib. intra. 640. B. sect. 4. & fol. 662.

For he hath only an interest in the Herbage, Q. tamen. He that hath not soil.A lets Land to B, for to sow, and A to have the Moiety of the Corn, yet B cannot have tres∣pass Quare clausum fregit against him for wast∣ing of the Corn, for he hath interest in the whole Crop, Hill. 30 Eliz. Hre versus Oakley. And although this was not pleaded in abatement, yet the special matter being found, the Plaintiff shall not have judgment, because it appears to
the Court they cannot be disjoined to have an acti∣on in such form. For they are upon the matter joint-tenants of the Land. He to whose use.He to whose use, shall not have Trespass in his own name, but in the name of the Feoffees, Crooke 17 Hen. 7.41. pl. 2. For the Estate in Law is in them.

Disseisee shall have Trespass for the mean pro∣fits,Disseisee. and all other things after his re-entry, Coke 11. part. 51. A. Liffords case. 3 Hen. 4.13. pl. 18. Gascoigne, 37 H. 6.7. pl. 13. but not be∣fore, because then he had no interest in the Land, but a bare right. But before his entry, he shall not have Tres∣pass, 32 Hen. 6.32. A. 38 Hen. 6.28. A. For∣tescue, viz. against one that entred before he was disscised. Q.

B. Where there is a necessity, the Law doth give way to usual things rather than there should be a failure of Justice.
An Executor shall have Trespass for Goods taken out of the possession of the Testator,Executor. Nat. Br. 87. E. Regist. 98. A. in respect of his interest by his Executorship. And the Writ shall not say ad grave damnum neque in retardationem executionis testamenti, Re∣gist. orig. 98. A. the Count, Lib. intra. 640. A. sect. 2. But this was given by the Stat. of 4 Edw. 3. cap. 6. 14 Hen. 7.13. And at this day an Executor of an Executor shall have such an Action, Regist. 98. A. the rule there; it seems upon the equity of the former Statute. But he should not have had it before, 25 Edw. 3. viz. at the Common Law. cap. 5. Com. 290. A. Chapmans case. But an Executor shall not have such Action De clauso fracto, 11 Hen. 4.3. pl. 8. 4 Edw. 4.8. A. Catesby. viz. in vita Testatoris; for this is not within the Statute. Neque de Arboribus succisis tempore Testatoris, 18 Edw. 4.16. A. Pigott. Nor this, and so both are left at the Common Law. An Executor shall not have Trespass before probate of the Will, unless it be for a thing taken out of his own possession, Com. 281. Q. ratio∣nem differentiae. One Executor shall have Trespass for a thing taken out of his possession, with his companion, 42 Edw. 3.26. pl. 12. 2 Rich. 2. Executor 75. For Executors are but as one person in Law, or he may bring it alone.
But the 19 Hen. 6.65. to the contrary. Q. Executor shall have Trespass de bonis Testatoris sportatis in custodia sua exten. Regist. orig. 94. A. 2 Hen. 7.15. 6 Edw. 4.1. and good; for they are accounted the Testators, though to be disposed of by the Executor in performance of the will. A. takes Administration of the Goods of B, C proves a Will, by which he was made Exe∣cutor, and brought Trespass against A for the Goods, it lies, although the Administration was not repealed; for the Administration was void from the beginning, Mich. 12. Jac. Ban. Regis. Fisher & Young. because there was a Will made. An Executor shall have Trespass against the lessor which outs him, during the Term, Regist. rig. 102. B. if he have a Lease parol. Q. if by Deeds, whether he ought not to bring an Action of Recovery. If the Lessor outs the Executor of the Lessee, the Writ shall be Summon. per bonos summonit. &c. but if he outs him, and takes the Goods of the Lessor within the Land, the Writ shall be pone per vad. &c. Regist. orig. 102. B. in the Note, and this is in respect of the dammages he is to an∣swer for taking the Goods. Trespass lieth by a Goaler against one that takes  prisoner from him;Goaler. for the Gaoler is liable for the person; but a good bar that he is not Goaler, because it is the ground of the Action, 4 Edw. 4.6. pl. 7. & fol. 44. pl. ult. Church-wardens shall have Trespass for the Goods of the Church taken in their time,Church-wardens or in the time of their Predecessors, Nat. br. 91. K.

But they shall count ad damnum parocbiano∣rum, 8 Edw. 4.6. pl. 12 Hen. 7.27. pl. 7. For the Goods are the Parishioners, and the Church-warden is interested in their right, and is account∣able unto them. But a good plea that he is not Churchwarden, 4 Edw. 4.7. A. For that destroys the supposal of the Writ. But 19 Hen. 6.66. says; that it is not good for Goods in the time of their Predecessors. Q. yet the Law seems to be otherwise, else the pa∣rishioners might be damnified. Trespass for making a Grant of Rent in see ta∣ken to the use of the Parochians, Lib. intra. 7. D. Q. Heir Ravish∣ment.Every Ancestor male or female, shall have Trespass for ravishing of his or her Heir appa∣rent against a stranger, but not against the Gar∣dein in Chivalry, unless the Father only, Coke. 3. part. 38.

A man shall have Trespass for his Son and Heir, Daughter and Heir taken away, Nat. br. 98. H. 29 Assize 35. 21 Hen. 6.14. pl. 29.12 Hen. 4.16. pl. 9. 3 Edw. 4.12. B. Danby. For it is an injury to the Parents to lose the comfort of the Child, especially the eldest.
And this of what age soever his Son be, 32 Edw. 3. Gard. 32. though the dammage may be greater or less in regard of the Age. A Grantee of Herbage of Land shall have Tres∣pass,Grantee. quare clausum fregit for the Grass, but not for the other profits of the Land, as Fruit-trees, and the like, 11 Eliz. Dyer. 285 pl. 40. 3 Hen. 16. 13. A. 5. Hen. 7.10. B. For he hath no∣thing but the Herbage granted unto him. The Heir shall have Trespass for taking of a Deed concerning Land to him descended,Heir. and it is good, although he doth not say, scriptum suum, because of necessity it must belong to him, 1 Edw. 3.18, pl. 11. For it goes along with the inheri∣tance. But not against an Executor that taketh a Box with Deeds. 1. Because the Box appertaineth to him. 2. He had not knowledge what was in the Box. 3. The Heir hath other remedy a∣gainst him, scilicet a Detinue, 43 Edw. 3.24. pl. 3. because the Box and Deeds come to him in a lawful way, though he cannot justifie the detain∣ing. But it lies against an Executor for taking away a Furnace fixed, or Fatts fixed to the Free-hold, or Pales fastned, Windows, Doors, Evidences loose, 21 Hen. 7.26. pl. 4. because they all be∣long to the Free-hold as part of it. It lies for an Heir against an Executor for ta∣king Fishes out of a Pond, Mich. 36 Eliz. Ban. Regis. Rot. 25. Parlett versus Gray. Crooke 118 pl. 60. For they belong to the soil, viz. the Land covered with Water which makes the Pond.
So for Deer or Pigeons, vide Assize 27. pl. 29. but not tame Deer or tame Pigeons; the out is as it were an Inheritance, the other a Chattel. The Lessor excepts the Trees,Lessor. he shall have Trespass quare clausum fregit, 14 Hen. 8.1. 28 Hen. 8. Dyer. 19. pl. 48. 46 Edw. 3.22. pl. 3. Coke 8. part. 63. A. Swaynes case. against the Lessor, if he cut them down. A Lessor at Will shall not have Trespass, al∣though he determines his Will, until he enters, Crooke 3. Hen. 8.163. pl. 4. For before he hath no Title. A enters upon Tenant at Will, and subverts the soil, he shall have one Action, and the Les∣sor another, 19 Hen. 6.45. pl. 94. so of a Copy∣holder and Lord, 2 Hen. 4.12. Coke 4. part. 31. A. For as they are both damnified, so it is reason they should both have recompence. Lessee cuts Trees to the intent to repair,Lessee. the Lessor takes them, the Lessee shall have Tres∣pass, 44 Edw. 3.44. for the dammage done him in causing him to lose his labour in cutting of them. A stranger cuts Trees, the Lessee shall have Trespass, and shall recover treble dammages, Doct. & Stud. 34. A. 23 Hen. 8. Br. wast. 138. 44 Hen. 8.26. because the Lessor shall recover so much of the Lessee in respect of the Waste. But if the Lessor dies, the Lessee shall reco∣ver but single dammages, 44 Edw. 3.26. Crooke 3 Hen. 8.163. pl. 4. because no more shall be re∣covered against him by the Heir. 1. If the Servant be beat,Master. the Master shall have Trespass, Nat. br. 91. I. Regist. orig. 102. A.
8 Hen. 6.28. 19 Hen. 6.35. pl. 73. although he be but a servant at will, 21 Hen. 6.9. A. New∣ton. vide 11 Hen. 4.2.2. For the beating of the Servant is a dammage to the Master, and the Ser∣vant may also have this Action. 2. For taking away his Apprentice, Nat. br. 91. I. 8 Hen. 6.28. 21 Hen. 6.31. pl. 18. where∣by he loseth his service. 3. The Lord of a Villain shall have Trespass, 22 Hen. 6.30.32. for taking away his Villain, or beating him, as it seems. The Ordinary shall have it for a thing taken out of his possession,Ordinary. Nat. br. 91. M. 18 Hen. 6.23. 7 Hen. 4.18. pl. 22. 11 Hen. 7.12.17 Edw. 2. brev. 8 22. as Ordinary, for he hath a kind of property in it. But not for a thing which was not in his possession, Nat. br. 92. A. Coke 9. part 39. A. Henslees case, 7 Hen. 4.18. pl. 22. For the Law takes no notice of his right without a possession. A Parson shall have Trespass for Tithes taken after severance of the 9 parts,Parson. 10 Hen. 4.2. pl. 2. Gascoign, 21 Hen. 7.27. pl. 5. before any seisure, because it is certain by the severance what was his, and the Law casts the possession and pro∣perty upon him, Com. 281. A. Foxes case. But not of a Mortuary before seisure, Com. 281. A. 10. Hen. 4.1. but there is but a bare customa∣ry right. A Parson or Vicar shall have Trespass for the Walls or Glass of the Church, or Grass or Trees in the Church-yard, &c. or Glebe-Land, 11 Hen. 4.12. pl. 25. 8 Hen. 6.9. pl. 20. 11 Hen. 6.4. B. Danby. Q. For the Church belongs
to the Parishioners, and the Chancel to the Par∣son, yet the free-hold of the Church is in the Parson. Parson imparsonee shall have Trespass against any that is admitted and inducted into the said Church, if he intermeddle with the Glebe or Tythes, Com. 500. B. 38 Hen. 6.24. 39 Hen. 6.24. & 27. because they belong unto him. Protected person.He that hath a protection Royal, shall have Trespass against him that takes his Goods, Nat. br. 92. B. though if not protected, he might take them; for during the protection, he is not to be molested, and so hath wrong done him. If one hath the possession of a thing,Possessor. he shall maintain an Action against him that hath no right, Com. 546. A. whether his possession be lawful or not. But note,Note. that upon a possession in Law only he shall not have Trespass, 22 Hen. 6.49.5. but it must be an actual possession, for that is vi∣sible and notorious, and the other is not so, but may be disputable. But if A gives Goods to B, B shall have Tres∣pass before possession, for he hath the property in Law in them, 2 Edw. 4.25. per 2 Justices, Coke 3. part. 26, 27. Butler & Baker. and pro∣perty in Law is made then a possession in Law. In a Trespass brought it was found by office, that another was Tenant, and that it escheated to the King, this shall abate the Writ as to the things upon the Land, Com. 488. B. Nichols case, & 546. A. 19 Edw. 4.2. pl. 5. because the Land was the Kings, and not the Plaintiffs.
He that enters upon the possession of the King, shall not gain possession, therefore he shall not have Trespass, Com. 546. A. Paramors case. 2 Hen. 4.7. pl. 29. For nothing can pass out of the Crown but by matter of Record. Or upon a Farmer of the King, 2 Hen. 4.7. pl. 29. For he is in upon the Kings right, and the prejudice done unto him, is done unto the King immediately. But against him that outs the Farmer, the King shall have Trespass, Com. 546. A. Para∣mors case. Q. whether the Farmer may not also have Trespass. The King shall have Trespass,King. Nat. Br. 90. I. Regist. orig. 99. A. And in this case the party cannot make fine, because the dammages are to the King himself, to Hen. 4.3. pl. 7. and the fine shall be inclu∣ded in the dammages. Q. tamen. For it seems he shall make fine. But for Trespass in the Rings Lands there uses to be an information in the Exchequer, Nat. br. 90. I. This is not by way of English Bill, but on the Pleas side. Q. if it may not be by an En∣glish Bill. And in such case the judgment is, that the par∣ty shall be removed and put out of possession, al∣though that it be but a personal Suit, and the re∣moval shall be by Writ formed in the case, di∣tected to the Sheriff. Com. 561. B. This Judg∣ment is by way of Decree; ergo on the Pleas side. But the King may have a Trespass quare clan∣sum fregit, Nat. br. 90. I. if he will.
The Queen shall have Trespass without the King,Queen. Nat. Br. 101. for Lands belonging to her Revenue, and she is not in the nature of another Feme covert. Revusancy shall be pleaded in disability to sue an Action of Trespass for as many Hereditaments as are not seised into the Kings hands,Recusant. 3 Jac. cap. 5. For such as are seised concern not the Recu∣sant. A Bishop shall not have an Action of Tres∣pass for a Trespass made in a vacancy of the Bishoprick,Bishop. 39 Edw. 3.12. pl. 18. 18 Edw. 2. Trespass 237. For that could not concern him, but the Guardian of the Spiritualties, as it seems. Vide tamen Regist. 101. A Writ formed in such case for the succeeding Bishop. Ergo. Q. Master of an Hospi∣tal.A Master of an Hospital shall have an Action of Trespass for a thing done in the time of his Predecessor; for the dammage redounds to the House, Nat. br. 89. G. Regist. orig. 196. B. the Writ there. And by the same reason why may not the Bishop for a Trespass done in the Vacancy? Tenant at will.Tenant at Will shall have Trespass against a Stranger, 19 Hen. 6.45. pl. 94. 12 Edw. 4.8. pl. 20. 35 Hen. 6.5. pl. 7. For he hath a Title against him. For entring his Close, and burning his Hay, 35 Hen. 6.5. pl. 7. Copy-holder shall have Trespass,Copy-hol∣der. Coke 4. part. 31. A. 2 Hen. 4.12. pl. 49. Coke. 4. part. 4.21. B, & 23. B. and this before his admission, per descent; for his admission is but a Ceremony, yet essential to his Estate.
Tenant in common.Tenants in Common join in Trespass touching their Tenancies, Littleton, sect. 315. 18 Hen 6.5. 14 Hen. 6.9. pl. 38. 12 Hen. 6.4. pl. 11. 45 Edw. 3.13. 5 Hen. 4.1. 14 Hen. 4.31. 43 Edw. 3.24. pl. 3: 22 Hen. 6.12. in respect of their common and undivided interests. But if one dies, the other shall have an Action for all the Trespass, 43 Edw. 3.24. pl. 3. For it survives with the Land. They ought to join in Trespass, 5 Rich. 2. cap. 7. 34 Hen. 6.32. pl. 16. 4 Edw. 4.18. 21 Hen. 7.22. because it concerns them both in common and undividedly. Note, For battery they shall not join, Reg. orig. 105. B. For that is a distinct Trespass; for the beating of one is not the beating of the other. A had Male Swans, B Female, which having young ones, for the young ones they shall join, if they be taken away, because they are Tenants in Common, Coke. 7. part. 17. A. 2 Rich. 3.15, 16. of the Swans and the young ones. One Tenanant in common shall not have Tres∣pass de bonis asportatis, against his companion that takes them, Lib. Intra. 653. B. sect. 3. be∣cause he hath an interest in them. Tenant for ano∣thers life.Tenant for anothers Life is disseised, he for whose life he held dies, Tenant for anothers Life shall have Trespass without re-entry, because the Act of God shall not prejudice him, 19 Hen. 6.28. B. Ascough. Coke 5. part. 41. Kniets case.
Tenant at sufferance.Tenant at sufferance shall not have Trespass, Crook. 17 Hen. 7.47. A. for the feebleness and uncertainty of his Estate. If a man be outlawed or attainted in Trespass or Felony,Outlawed. and pardoned, he shall have Trespass for Trespass done to his person before the pardon, 29 Assize pl. 63. No. Lib. intra. 248. A. 30 Edw. 3.4. pl. 18. For by the pardon he is made rectus in curia, and restored to the priviledge of the Law ab initio. But for other Trespass, quaere 5 Edw. 3.170. viz. concerning his Goods or Lands in respect of the forfeiture. But before a Scire facias be brought upon the pardon, he cannot without doubt, because the pardon was conditional, 21 Edw. 3.55 pl. 7. Q. Against whom Trespass lies. Administrator takes the Goods,Admini∣strator. B proves a Will, by which he was made Executor, and brought Trespass, and it lies, although the Ad∣ministration were never repealed; for the Admi∣nistration was void ab initio, and the Administra∣tor a Trespasser, Mich. 12. Jac. Ban. Regis. Fisher & Young. A makes a Trespass,Agree∣ment. B agrees to it afterwards, and avows the doing of it; yet B is no Tres∣passer, 9 Edw 3.35. pl. 17, For the consenting is a matter ex post facto, and cannot make him a Trespasser ab initio. Trespass lies against an Alien,Alien. Digest. br. 72. A. For an Alien is subject to the Laws of the Land, as much as concerns the peace and quiet of it.
Attainted person.A person attainted shall be sued in Trespass, Mich. 38, & 39 Eliz. Com. Ban. Banister & Trussel. No. Lib. intra. 248. A. For he shall not take advan∣tage of his own wrong, to plead it in bar to the prejudice of another. An Infant makes a Letter of Attorney to A,Attorney. to take Livery and Seisin for him, A takes it, the Infant shall not have Trespass against A, be∣cause it is for his advantage to take the Livery for him, 21 Hen. 6.31. B. Ascue. Husband and wife.Trespass De muliere abducta cum bonis viri, &c. lies against Husband and Wife, because the Wife may assent at the time to the Ravishment, and also to the carrying away of the Goods, 43 Edw. 3. pl. 15.44. Assize 13. and this Assent makes her a joint Trespasser with her Husband. Trespass against Husband and Wife, the Wife is taken by Capias, but not the Husband; Dod∣deridge and Haughton Justices said, that if the Declaration be against the Wife alone, it is not good, and if there be no Declaration, the Wife shall be at large; but afterwards Dodderidge said, a Declaration shall be put in against the Husband and Wife, and the Wife appearing, shall be com∣mitted to prison; to which Crooke agreed: yet quaere what was done in it, Mich. 15 Jac. Ban. Regis. Ashwel against Opshard and his Wife; if no Bail be put in for her: So hath it been since held by Rolle Chief Justice. If the Woman beat another, the Husband must be named in the Writ, Regist. orig. 105. B. Lib. intra. 612. A. sect. 11. for he must an∣swer for his Wifes behaviour.
Trespass lies against him that commands ano∣ther to do a Trespass,Comman∣der. Doct. & Stud. 19. A. ta∣men quaere. For it seems otherwise. Body po∣litick.It lies against a Master of an Hospital and his Brethren, Regist. orig. 105. B. For they are one body in Law, and so it is but one Trespass done by them all. Dean and Chapter.It lies against a Dean and Chapter, 32 Hen. 6.8. pl. 13. for the same reason. Mayor & Commu. nalty.It lies against a Mayor and Communalty, Qua∣re vi & armis, 38 Edw. 3.18. 8 Hen. 6.1. 9 Hen. 6.36. 20 Hen. 6.9. 15 Edw. 4.2. 4 Hen. 7.13. 32 Hen. 6.10. for the same cause. But no Capias lies against them, because they cannot appear all in person; for this would make confusion, 45 Edw. 3.2 & 3. 22 Assize 67. 21 Edw. 3.59. pl. 1. But they must appear by an Attorney for them all. Disseisee shall have Trespass against his Dissei∣sor before his entry,Disseisor. for the former entry upon his Disseisin, 32 Hen. 6.32. 38 Hen. 6.28. A. Fortescue. But after his entry he shall have Trespass a∣gainst the Disseisor for all the mean profits taken during the Disseisin, Coke 11. part. 51. A. Lif∣fords case, 3 Hen. 4.13. pl. 18. Gascoigne. 37 Hen. 6.7. pl. 12. But shall not have Trespass against the Dissei∣sor of the Disseisor, for then the last Disseisor should be twice charged, Coke 11. part. 51. once by the first Disseisor, and a second time by the Disseisee, which is unreasonable.
Neither against the Feoffee or Feoffor of the former Disseisor, 34 Hen. 6.30. pl. 14. 13 Hen. 7.15. Coke 11. part. 51. for the same reason. Liffords case, 2 Edw. 4.18. pl. 12. per 2 Justices, Crooke 12 Hen. 7.1. pl. 2. But against a Co-adjutor of a Disseisor it lies, 21 Edw. 4.5, & 19. for he is as the Dissei∣sor himself. It lies against an Infant,Infant. Digest. br. 72. Q. of what age. It seems at the age of Discre∣tion. It lies not against an Executor,Executor. quia actio personalis moritur cum persona, Doct. & Stud. 75. viz. for a Trespass done by the Testator, if personal. Guardian shall have Trespass against his Ward,Guardian. 5 Hen. 4.2. pl. 7. Q. for what Trespass; whe∣ther for a Trespass done to him as his Guar∣dian? It lies against an Ideot,Ideot. Digest. br. 72. A. Q. for it seems it lies not against one not com∣pos mentis. Trespass and Imprisonment lies not against any of the Judges at Westminster,Judge. although he com∣mit him without cause, 21 Hen. 6. pl. 9. in fine. For this would be to affront Justice, to call the Judges in question for doing things as Judges. But they are questionable by the King. But if Auditors commit not an Accomptant forthwith, but at another time,Auditors. Trespass lies against them, 27 Hen. 6.8. pl. 7. For their pow∣er is limited to time and place; for they are Judges but hac vice.
It lies against a Miller that takes toll of them that are Toll-free,Miller. 41 Edw. 3.24. pl. 17. 44 Ed. 3.20. pl. 16. for it is dammage to them, and wrong in the Miller. It lies against the Queen sole without joyning the King;Queen. for the King cannot be a Trespasser to any. Trespass lies not against the Lord,Lord. per Marle∣bridge cap. 13. Q. for what Trespasses, and by whom. It seems for Trespasses done to his Vil∣lains most properly. Non ideo puniatur dominus per redemptionem, Coke 4. part. 11. B. Bevills case. But afore this Statute Trespass did lie against the Lord vi & armis, 48 Edw. 3.20. pl. 16 Thorp. for there the peace of the Commonwealth is con∣cerned. The reason that it lies not against the Lord is, insomuch that he cannot come within his Te∣nants Land, being within his Fee, against the peace, although he had not cause to distrain; for it seems he may go any where within his own Fee, 47 Edw. 3.7. pl. 3. Finchden. Quaere ta∣men. This Statute is intended as well to every Lessor as of the Lord, 9 Hen. 6.43. pl. 21. this is in cases of Entries to distrain. If the Lord distrain where nothing is in ar∣rear, yet Trespass lies not against him, Coke 4. part. 11. B. Bevils case, 9. part. 76. A. because he may do this as Lord. Q. for it seems unreasonable to vex his Tenants without cause; yet they are not without remedy, for they may replevy the distress.
But if the Lord distrain where there is no∣thing arrear, and the Mesn will put his Cattel in the Pound for the Cattel of the Tenant, and the Lord will not permit him, Trespass lies against the Lord, Coke 9. part. 22. B. Case of Avowry; because here the Lord is offered a legal way to come to his right, if any thing be due to him. And if the Lord incroach, and afterwards di∣strain for the Services, and for the Incroachment also, the Tenant may tender the very Services, and shall have Trespass for the other, Coke 4. part. 11. B. Bevils case, 10 Hen. 6.3. pl. 11. for though the Law favour him as Lord, yet it will not countenance his incroaching. And if a Baily or Servant distrains where no∣thing is arrear, Trespass lies, because it is not within the Statute, Coke 9. part. 76. A. Combs case, 9 Hen. 5.10. 11 Hen. 4.78. B. 9 Hen. 7.4. 48 Edw. 3.20. pl. 16. and they must take heed not to be too officious for their Master. Against the Lord.When the Lord abuses his Authorty given him by the Law, he shall be punished by Trespass, Coke 8. part. 146. the six Carpenters case; for the Law will not countenance wrong, but punish it in any person. If he labour or kill the Distress, 8 Edw. 4.15. 22 Edw. 4, 5. pl. 16. & fol. 47. pl. 22. Coke 8. part. 146. B. Trespass lies; for he must use it only as the Law allows. If he tie the Cattel in the pound, 27 Assize 64. which he ought not to do, Trespass lies against him.
If he break the hedges or gates, or such like, of the party where he distrains, 20 Edw. 4.3. pl. 11. 48 Edw. 3.6. pl. 10. for though the Law allow him a way to come by his right, yet in do∣ing it, it allows him not to do dammage to the other unnecessarily. If he cut the Trees, or stay all night, 11 Hen. 4.75. upon the Land, for this the Law warrants him not to do. The Lessee cuts Trees to repair, the Lessor carries them away, and Trespass lies against him, 44 Edw. 3.44. for the Lessor might cut them, and therefore to take them away was a Tres∣pass. If the Lessor distrain dammage feasant, 5 Hen. 7.10. pl. 2. upon the Land left; for he hath no present interest, and so there can be no such dam∣mages. So if he out the Termor, 48 Edw. 3.6. pl. 11. Trespass and Ejectment lies. Or the Executor of the Termor, Regist. orig. 102. B. may have this Action, for now the term is come unto him. The Lessor excepts the Trees, and roots them up, it seems Trespass lies, Coke 11. part. 49. B. Lissords case, in respect of the dammage done in the Soil by the rooting. Quaere tamen, for the whole Trees are reserved. The Lord sells the Distress, and buys it again, Trespass lies, 29 Hen. 8. Dyer 35. pl. 34. for he ought not to sell it, and the buying of it again cannot salve the matter. It lies by a Copyholder against the Lord that cuts him, 21 Edw. 4.80. Coke 4. part. 22. A.
in respect of his interest in the Land by the Cu∣stome of the Mannor. The Reason in all these Cases is, when one hath authority, license, or entry by the Law given him, by the misusing it, or the not do∣ing it as he ought, he is a Trespasser ab initio, Coke 8.146. Deaf and dumb.It lies against one that is deaf and dumb, Di∣gest. br. 72. A. for he may see to do a Trespass. Q. if it lies against a blind man; it seems it doth. Tenant at will.If Tenant at will make voluntary waste, Coke 5. part. 13. B. Salops case, Littleton, 15. A. fo. per 3 Mariae Dyer 122. B. This is a determination of the Will of the Lessee, and Trespass lies by the Lessor without entry, because the term is deter∣mined. For cutting Underwood Trespass lies, 2 Edw. 4.24. pl. 25. But quaere in what cases. Tenant by sufferance.It lies not against Tenant by sufferance, be∣cause he comes lawfully to the possession, 22 Edw. 4.13. pl. 3. viz. at the first, and he holds not by tort, because by sufferance. Tenant in Common.If there be two Tenants in common of a fold∣ge by prescription, one shall have a Trespass a∣gainst the other, for the breaking the fold, Nat. br. 91. A, H. Q. For taking away the Meer-stones that bound Land,Meer-stone. 1 Hen. 5.1. pl. 1. for this is a great injury to the Owner of the Land, bounded by them. Note,Sheriff. when the Court hath not Jurisdiction of the cause commenced there, the Officer that makes the Arrest shall be a Trespasser; but where the Court hath Jurisdiction, and proceeds ronice, there it is not punishable, Coke 10. part.
76. A. for the Officer is not to judge of the pro∣ceedings; but where there is no Jurisdiction the Officers have no warrant at all for what they do, for they are accounted no Officers. The Sheriff takes one not named in the Writ, Trespass lies against the Sheriff, 11 Hen. 4.91. A. Hankeford, 13 Hen. 4.2. Hankeford & Thirning; for he hath no warrant for the Arrest. It seems also a Writ of false Imprisonment lies. But if the Plaintiff shew another person to him, that was not to be Arrested, the Action lies against them both, for they are both Actors in the same Trespass. A procures the Sheriff to Arrest B without a Writ, and after purchased a Writ, and the She∣riff arrests him afterwards, being in his custody, the Action lies, 7 Eliz. Dyer 244. pl. 61. for the purchasing the Writ, and Arresting of him after∣wards, cannot purge the first wrong. The Sheriff takes B upon a Capias, and re∣turns not the Writ, B shall have Trespass, 20 Hen. 6.24. A. 21 Hen. 6.5. for if the Writ be not re∣turned, it is as if there were no Writ. Otherwise upon a Capias ad satisfaciend. for that is an Execution, and needs no return, Coke 4. part. 67. A. Capias to the Sheriff of Middlesex, and he takes him in London, Trespass lies, 16 Edw. 4.6. for it is out of his County, and so done without warrant. So if he makes a Repleg. of Cattel distrained of an estranger, he may have Trespass against him, 14 Hen. 4 24. pl. 32. per Haukeford & Thirning, Doct. & Stud. 150. A. Q.
So if he come to make a Repleg. and breaks the hedges and gates, 20 Hen. 6.28. pl. 19. for he ought not to do such violence. So if he attach the Horse of the Master, in possession of the Servant, for the debt of the Ser∣vant, Doct. & Stud. 138. B. for the property is in the Master. So if he breaks the house to Arrest for Debt or Trespass, 13 Edw. 4.9. A. 18 Edw. 4.4. A. Coke 5. part. Semayns case; for this is against Law. So if he makes a good return in Law, but a false in deed upon a Habeas corpus, Coke 9. part. 99. B. Bags case, 9 Hen. 6.44. for he ought to return the matter of fact truly. If he takes Felons goods, where another hath them within his Hundred, Nat. br. 91. F. for this is without warrant. Difference betwixt seising & taking.One appears for receiving Felons, the Sheriff takes his Goods, and after he is acquitted, Trespass lies against the Sheriff; for he ought to have seized them only, and the other shall find Sureties, and if he can find none they shall be in the custody of his Neighbours, 43 Edw. 3.24. pl. 1. which is in custody of the Law; but where they are taken they are not so. It lies against one outlawed,Outlaw. Digest. br. 72. A. Mich. 38 & 39 Eliz. Com. Ban. Banister against Trussel, No. Lib. Intra. 248. A. for though an Out lawed person is not protected by the Law, yet he may be punished by the Law for wronging a∣nother, else it might be mischievous.
For what matters Trespass lies, viz. for doing of wrong to the dammage of another; 1. touching Inheritance: 2. touching Chattels: 3. touching the Body. The Plaintiff ought to shew the Town where the Inheritance corporate lies,Of Inhe∣ritance. concerning which the Trespass is brought; for otherwise there can be no venue to try the Issue;Note.

the disjunctive, 6 Hen. 7.12. 10 Edw. 4.11. pl. 35. viz. of a Disseisin or Detainer by force; for the word Or is sometime used copulative as well as disjunctive. It lies upon an entry with force, although the entry be congealable, 9 Hen. 6.19. because force is forbidden by that Statute. Upon 5 Rich. 2. cap. 7. the Writ needs not men∣tion what Lands certain, 4 Edw. 4.18. pl. 35. 5 Edw. 4.26. A. for the Statute doth not direct it. It shall not be vi & armis, without shewing that the entry was congealable, 34 Hen. 6.26. pl. 4. for if it were not congealable, it is supposed to be vi & armis. If the entry be supposed in A and B, where B is a Hamlet of A; yet good, because dammages is only to be recovered, 5 Edw. 4.8. and not the Land, and so the place is not much material.

But Error in process or default of Clerks ought to be reversed in the same Term, or otherwise it lies not in the same Court, as it seems by the Ju∣stices, Trin. 7. Jac. ban. regis, Prowse & Skeyn∣ner. Q. But one case was Mich. 41 & 42 Eliz. Rot. 639. which is a rule that Error lies in another Term upon Error in Process, when the party can∣not have Error in the Exchequer Chamber.
But by the Stat. of 27 Eliz. cap. 8. if Judg∣ment be given in ban. regis, upon a Suit commen∣ced there, the Writ of Error lies in the Exche∣quer-Chamber, before the Iustices of the Com∣mon Ban. and Barons of the Exchequer, or six of them, Coke 3. part 7. B. 4. part 53 & 86. A. 5 part 18. B. 28. A. 43. A. 97. B. But then it ought to be in Debt, Detinue, Ac∣count, Covenant, Ejectione firmae, Trespass upon the case, and no other Actions, for the Stat. shall not be largely expounded. And also nothing shall be assigned for Error in the jurisdiction of the Court, or form of the Writ, Return, Plaint, Bill, Declaration, Plead∣ings, Process, Verdict, or Proceedings; but on∣ly in matter in Law. And also a Writ of Error lies upon this in Parliament, viz. upon a judgment given in the Kings Bench. Iudgment given in Chancery, according to the Common Law, that is, on the Petty-bag side, shall be redressed in Parliament, 37 Hen. 6.13. 11 Edw. 4.8. Choke. So it seems of a judgment in the Exchequer-Chamber. Or in ban. regis, 14 Eliz. Dyer 315. pl. 100. and so it seems 37 Hen. 6.13. 8 Edw. 3.25. 17 Assize pl. 24. com. 393. A. 39. Assize 18.

But another Subject upon this being grieved, shall have this redressed in Parliament, 16 Edw. 3. bre. 651. 37 Hen. 6.13.

For such things are not accounted judgments, but may be rectified in some cases upon a mo∣tion made to that power. But Error was brought upon an Utlawry, up∣on an Indictment taken before Iustices of the Peace, 11 Hen. 4.53. For an Outlawry is a kind of a judgment given by the Coroner, though the Indictment pended before them.

But note,Note. in a Writ of Error upon a Judgment given in Chester, day shall be given for so long time that three Counties may be held there, be∣fore the return of the Writ in Ban. Regis, with∣in the which time the Justices or Lieutenant of the same County may redress the Error by the u∣suage of the said County, Regist. orig. 17. A. if they please. But in a Writ of Error upon a Writ of Error depending there, they have no such power; but the Record and the process ought to be remanded at the first County or Court into Ban.

Regist. orig. 17. A. The usuage is to have a Writ out of the Chan∣cery retornable in Ban. Regis; for Writs of Er∣ror are excepted in the Charters granted to Che∣ster. And in this Error there, the Justices may a∣ward a Scire facias against the Defendant, return∣able at the next County, and if the Judgment be affirmed, the party may have a special Writ of Error, reciting the former Writ, and
have the Records and Process of both Judg∣ments removed in Ban. Regis, there to be exa∣mined, and a Scire facias awarded against the Tertenant ad audiendum errores; for otherwise the party shall not be restored to that which he lost, 15 Eliz.

Dyer 345. pl. 6. if the judg∣ment be reversed, the party shall be restored, and the Judges there forfeit to the King 100 l. although the Judgment was given by their Prede∣cessors. But then it is not intended of Error in fact, but only of Error within the Record or Process, No. Lib. intra. 231. A. sect. 2. Upon a Claim allowed by the Justices of the Forest, Error lies upon it in Ban. Regis,Forest. 21 Edw. 3.48. pl. 70. For such Allowance is a Judgment in its nature. If eroneous Judgment be given in the Stanna∣ries,Stannaries it shall be redressed first before the Warden of the Stannaries, and after, before the Council of the Prince, and after, before the King himself, as supream Judge. It seems at the Council-Ta∣ble, and not in the Kings Bench. Pasch. 7. Jac. Regis. per Flemming chief Ju∣stice, a Writ of Error or false judgment lies not upon judgment given in the Court of the Stan∣naries, as was resolved by all the Justices: and it seems the reason is, because it is but an English Court, and not a Court of Record.

Note,Note. this manner of proceeding is given by the Stat. of 28 Edw. 3. cap. 10. scil. that the er∣ror shall be redressed within the City; and if they do not redress it, then there shall be a commission; and if error be found, they shall forfeit to the party his treble dammages, and to the King 1000 Marks, &c. but by the 1 Hen. 4. cap. 5. their Fine is at the discretion of the Commissio∣ners. Judgment given in the Cinque-ports,Cinque-ports. shall not be redressed in com. ban. or ban. regis, but only by the Warden of the 5 Ports, at the Court at Shepewaye, & si falsum fuerit revoca∣bitur, & Major & Jurati qui dederunt Judi∣cium
fecerint fines & Major deponetur ab officio, 23 Eliz. Dyer 376. pl. 23. The Writ to the Cinque-ports shall be direct∣ed Custodi quinque portuum, vide 30 Hen. 6.6. Pole. But 30 Hen. 6.6. the Barons of the five Ports are Judges there. Upon a Custom in Village or Town to hold in all manner of Pleas,Village. and a judgment thereupon given, error lies in ban. regis, 21 Edw. 3.40. 37 Assize pl. 5. Nat. br. 20.

Judgment in Court of Pypowders shall be re∣dressed in ban. regis,Pypowder or com. ban. Nat. br. 20. D. Who shall have a Writ of Error. He that confesses the Action shall not have a Writ of error against his own confession,Parties. Nat. br. 21. K. 34 Hen. 6.41. For he hath lost all that advantage by his confession. Conusor of a Statute shall have a Writ of error if execution be not well sued out against him,Conusor. 18 Edw. 3.25. for to overthrow the exe∣cution. And although he were outlawed (if he be pardoned) for then he is enabled again to sue. 29 Assize 47. Nat. br. 22. B.
A Corporation shall have a Writ of Error jointly for a judgment given against them,Corpora∣tion. but no single person of them, 21 Edw. 4.58. Townesend. For they are all but one body, and cannot sever, nor be severed in pleading, or in being impleaded. He that disclaims shall not have it,Disclaim. Nat. br. 22. C. Coke. 8. part 6. B, & 62. A. viz. the thing sued for, whereupon judgment is gi∣ven. But if one plead Non-Tenure, and it be found against him,Non-Te∣nure. yet he shall have it, 6 Edw. 3.188. pl. 17. Nat. br. 22. C. For that is but a plea to the Action. A brought a Praecipe against B, who infeoffs C, judgment is given for A, yet B shall have error, 21 Edw. 3.53. 12 Assize 41.20. of As∣size, 2. 50 Assize 3. Coke 1. part. 111. Alba∣nies case; because the judgment is against him, and not the Feoffee. Judgment was given against the Defendant in debt, and after, because he paid it not, nor rendred his Body, &c. judgment was given upon a Scire facias against the Bail, and they all join in a Writ of error, and therefore held not good, because one of them is not party to the judgment given against the other, Mich. 9. Jac. Regis, Wildgoose against Duport; but they are distinct and several judgments, given against them severally, and ought to have several Writs of error. Trespass against two, where one was within age, and appears by Attorney, and judgment Quod capiantur, they join in a Writ of error, be∣cause
the judgment is entire, Hil. 9. Jac. Ban. Regis, Orme & Bird; and good, though the judgment was well given against one of them. Surviving joint-tenant shall have error of all the judgment given against both;Survivor. for he is only now concerned, 19 Edw. 3. Error 1.19. Assize pl. 8. Two outlawed upon a Capias in Redisseisin with force, one shall have error sole,Outlawed. 8 Hen. 4.3. For the Outlawry is as two Outlawries, viz. against each one of them particularly. Judgment against two in conspiracy,Conspira∣cy. one dies, the other shall have a Writ of error, 24 Edw. 3.76. pl. 99. else it would be mischievous to him, if the judgment be erroneous, if he may not re∣verse it. Mich. 30, & 31 Eliz. ban. regis, Pigot being an Infant, and another levies a fine,Infant. Pigot sole brought error, and good; for this is error in fact, there∣fore it shall be brought by him it most concerns, which here is the Infant. If one makes a Retraxit, viz. upon the Roll,Retraxit. that he will not proceed, yet he shall have error, Coke. 8. part 62. A. Beechers case. For the Re∣traxit was but till the judgment. The King shall have error,Reversion. 15 Edw. 3. Er∣ror 72. and that is but reasonable. He in reversion disseises two joint-Tenants for Life, and suffers an erroneous recovery, the wife releases with warranty, and dies; this warranty is a bar to the Writ of error, because by his own Act he had disabled himself to take benefit of the forfeiture, Coke 3. part. 61. A. Lincoln-Colledg case. Q. De cest case.
A recovers a Moyety of a Mannor against B, which infeoffs C, B,Heir. and C makes partition; B dies, his Heir shall have a Writ of error, and by Newton if A had issue a Son and a Daughter by one Venter, and another Daughter by another Venter, and dies, the Son enters, and dies, the youngest Daughter is found Heir in a Nuper obiit, they make partition, the eldest Daughter shall have a Writ of Error, 19 Hen. 6.25. A. For the judgment binds her interest till it be reversed. Prayer in Aid shall have a Writ of error, Nat. br. 21. C. Coke 3. part 3. B. 4 Assize,Pray in Ayd. pl. 7. For the praying in Aid is but to satisfie his Title which he had before. Patron after Aid,Patron. Prayer shall have error, 12 Hen 8.8. Pollard. For the Judgment concerns his Title, notwithstanding the Aid-Prayer. Garnishee shall have a Writ of error, 21 Hen. 6.35. B. Paston. 7 Hen. 6.41. Coke 5. part. 99. B. Hoes case.Garnishee For he is bound by the judg∣ment. Garnishee in London upon an Attachment ac∣cording to the Custom, shall have error, 22 Edw. 4.30, & 31. For the judgment is in part against him. Tenant per Receipt shall have error, Coke 3. part. 3.4 Assize 7. 20 Edw. 3. Error 2.Tenant. For by the Receipt he is made party to the Suit, and concerned in the judgment. Vouchee shall have a Writ of error, 8 Hen. 4. 3. Nat. br. 21. C. 4. Assize 7. 17 Edw. 3. Er∣rorVouchee. 90. Nat. br. 21. M. & 108. A. For by the Voucher he is called in, and made a party.
And the Tenant shall have another Writ of Er∣ror, 8 Hen. 4.3, 21 & Nat. br. 21. C. for they are se∣verally concerned. But if the Vouchee release before Error brought, the Tenant shall not have it, 17 Edw. 2. Recovery in value 32. for by the release he is barred, viz. a release of Errors, or of his right. Heir general shall have a Writ of Error, 20 Edw. 4.13. Lib. Intra. 269. A. Sect. 1. for he is prejudiced by the Judgment. And if the Ancestor be outlawed of Felony,Heir gene∣ral. he, viz. the Heir shall have it, Nat. br. 21. N. viz. to reverse the Outlawry, and to gain his own in∣terest. But not for High Treason, per 28 Eliz. cap. 2. because thereby the blood is corrupt and disabled. The Heir special shall have it for the Lands to which he is heir,Heir spe∣cial. 3 Hen. 4.19. Nat. br. 21. K. 9 Hen. 6.47. 1 Mariae Dyer 90. pl. 5. but he must have a special Writ, as it seems. Executor shall have Error upon judgment for debt or dammages,Executor: Nat. br. 21. M. given against the Testator, for the regaining of the Testators estate. Although that he be Executor to the Bishop, Parson, or other sole Corporation, Nat. br. 22. A. Coke 4. part. 65. A. Fulwoods case, 8 Hen. 6.25. A. Martin. for that makes no difference in the case. And this upon the Statute of 29 Eliz. cap. 8. Coke 6. part. fol. ult. Executor shall have error upon an Outlawry of the Testator, and restitu∣tion of the goods lost by the Outlawry, 11 Hen. 465. pl. 22. 5 Edw. 4.7.
Although that the Outlawry be for Felony, Coke 5. part. 111. A. vid. antea. Administrator shall have error in the same manner as Executor shall have,Admini∣strator. Nat. br. 21. M. 6 Edw. 6. Dyer 76. pl. 31. for he hath the same in∣terest in the Intestates personal estate. A Successor shall have error for a thing which toucheth the Succession,Successor. to a thing whereof he is so, Nat. br. 22. A. 16 Edw. 3. Error 69. 8 Hen. 6.25. A. Martin. The King collates A to a Chappel,King. against whom an Action is brought, A resigns to the King, the King collates B, Judgment is given pro querente, B shall have Error, 15 Edw. 3. Error 7. 15 Assize 8. for now the interest concerns him. But for Debt or Dammages recovered against a Bishop,Bishop. &c. or against any Secular sole Corpo∣ration, the Successor shall not have Error, Nat. br. 22. A. for the dammages concern the Executor and not the Successor, and so he hath no right to sue. He in Reversion after the particular estate end∣ed shall have Error at Common Law,Reverson. and not before, Coke 3 part. 4. A. 21 Hen. 6.29. Newton, 3 Hen. 4.6. 32 Edw. 3. Error 73. 4 Hen. 8. Dyer 6. pl. 5. com. 24. B. Weston, for before he is not con∣cerned in the Judgment. Q. And per 9 Rich 2. cap. 3. he shall have it du∣ring the Estate for life, Coke 3. part. 4. 22 Edw. 4.31. A. Vavisor, 3 Hen. 4 6. 12 Hen. 8.9. A. Brud∣nell. And this seems reasonable, for he may be prejudiced by the delay. Q. And by equity he in the remainder shall have it, Nat. br. 108. A. 1 Mariae, Dyer 90. pl. 5.
But at Common Law the Donor in tall shall not have it altogether, com. 241. B. Q. And yet he shall not have Error during the estate Tail, because he is not within the Statute of 9 Rich. 2. cap. 3. Coke 3. part. 61. A. Lincoln Colledge case, & 10. part. 44. B. Portingtons case. But after the Estate tail ended he shall have it, because the Law reserves the reversion in the Donor, Coke 3. part. 3. B. And although Tenant in tail suffered a Com∣mon Recovery, and released Errors, and yet ings error and is barred, and dies without issue; et the Donor or he in Remainder shall have Er∣or, 3 Eliz. Dyer 188. pl. 9. to reverse the Re∣covery; or if that be erroneous, then the Estate ail is not barred by it. Note, regularly no Stranger shall have Error,Estranger. 2 Edw. 4.31. per Brian, viz. a Stranger to the Judgment; but this holds not always. Conusor aliens, Execution is sued erroneously,Conusor. the Alience shall have error, Nat. br. 22. B. 4 Hen. 8. Dyer 1. pl. 5. 17 Assize, 24. 18 Edw. 3.25. pl. 17. Crooke, 6 Hen. 8.169. A. Pollard; for his title is concerned. A claims wood in a Forest,Tenant. and this allowed before two Justices of the Forest, B, & C, which claim Estovers, brought a writ of Error in Ban. Regis, 21 Edw. 3.48. pl. 70. and good to reverse this allowance, which is in nature of a Judgment, and binds their right to the Estovers. The Tenant in a Praecipe enfeoffs B, Judgment given pro quer. B shall have Error for the mischief, that may fall to him by the Judgment, 21 Edw. 3.53. 21 Assize 41. 20 Assize 2. 50 Assize 3.
But quaere 50 Assize 3. if the Tenant in the Praecipe aliens to B, which releases to the Feoffor for life, and judgment pro querente, if B shall have Error, per 9 Rich. 2. cap. 3. It seems he shall, for all his interest is not gone by the release. Where the King is party to the judgment,King. there shall be Error against him; but not before Peti∣tion made to the King, Pasch. 12 Jac. Ban. Regis, Davies case, 23 Edw. 3.12. pl. 14. 18 Hen. 6.17. 22 Edw. 3.3. pl. 25. 24 Edw. 35. pl. 43. for it may be, that upon the Petition the King will let the judgment be reversed without Suit; and it is not fit to sue the King, where one may have right of him for asking it without suit. The Writ of Error. The Writ ought to make mention of him, which was summoned and severed, 9 Hen. 6.38.13. because he was once party to the suit. An Action of Covenant is brought against A as Assignee, and judgment given against him, he brought Error, the Writ needs not mention him as Assignee, because this Addition was not of substance, 19 Eliz. Dyer 356. pl. 41. Q. for then he must be called Lessee which properly he is not but by construction of Law.
The Process in Error, 1. Ʋpon Judgment in Ire∣land. 2. Ʋpon a Bill sealed. 3. Judgment in another Court. Error brought upon a Judgment given in Ban. Regis in Ireland,Ireland. there shall be a Scire facias in the Writ of Error against him that had the judg∣ment; for by Sharde this is the usage, and in no other manner, 34 Assize pl. 7. and it is dangerous to alter the ancient practice of proceedings in Law. In Error upon a Bill sealed,Bill sealed. there shall be a Scire facias against the Justices, which sealed it, ad cognoscend. Sigilla, &c. per Westm. 2. cap. 31. Lib. Intra. 293. C. Sect. 1. 11 Hen. 4.92. This is where Error is brought upon a Bill of exceptions. But the Justices may deliver it in Court by their own hands, 11 Hen. 4.52.92. and then there shall be no Scire facias, for thereby they acknow∣ledge their hands. The Process in a writ of Error against the Judges, to whom the Writ is directed, is Alias,Process. Pluries, and Attachment, Nat. br. 22. G. if they do not certifie the Record which is before them. Errors s∣signedWhen the Record is removed after Errors assigned, the Plaintiff shall have a Scire facias a∣gainst the Defendant ad audiend. Errores, Nat. br. 22 E. 10 Edw. 4.13. 3 Eliz. Dyer 195. pl. 38. & 201. pl. 63. 17 Edw. 3.5. This is to give him no∣tice that the Record is removed, and of his pro∣ceeding thereupon. And upon two Nihils a Non est inventus re∣turned, the Court shall come to examination of the errors, 3 Eliz. 201. pl. 63. without the De∣fendants in the writ of Errors appearance.
But until Error assigned the party shall not have a Scire facias, 24 Edw. 3.31. pl. 8. for it is to no purpose, for his appearance is to hear the cause. And if he assign that for Error, which the Court takes clearly to be no error, he shall not have a Scire facias, 18 Hen. 6.17. for that would be to trouble the Court to no purpose; but if it be colourable it is otherwise. But in Error brought against the King, there shall be no Scire facias, because the King is in∣tended to be always in Court, Nat. br. 21. H. either himself or his Counsel, for the Judges are of his Counsel. The Writ needs not mention the names of the Tertenants,Against whom a Sci. fac. in Error shall be sued. because it is of common form used otherwise, 8 Hen. 4.17. pl. 3. and the naming of them is not material. If the Sheriff return that the Heir is not in his Bailywick,Other County. and the Tertenant shews that he is in another County, there shall go a Scire facias into that other County, 8 Hen. 4.18. pl. 3. Q. if he remove out of that into another, if another Scire facias shall issue, and so till he is found. If a Recoverer make a Feoffment,Tertenant and die without Heir, it seems there that a Scire facias lies against the Tertenant only, and a Writ of Error, 8 Hen. 4.17. pl. 3. 9 Hen. 6.49. B. pl. 30. Q. whether not against the Lord by Escheat also, because he comes in by virtue of the Judg∣ment. Former Judgment.But the 9 Hen. 6.46. B. pl. 30. a Writ of Error lies against none but the party, or them that are
privy to the former Judgment. Q. if not against privities in Law as well as in fact. Gardein in right.Gardein in right of the ward recovers in a Quare Impedit, and dies, the Defendant brought Error and a Scire facias against the Heir of the Recoverer, and against the Heir of him from whose right he took his title, and against the In∣cumbent, without naming the Executor; yet good, because he recovers as Gardein in right; but the contrary as Gardein in deed, 8 Hen. 6.35. pl. 1. for there it seems the Executor is con∣cerned, for the wardship is a Chattel. False Judgment.Error upon false Judgment in Oxford, viz. for Land, the party being dead that hath the Judg∣ment, there shall go a Scire facias as well against the Heir of the Recoverer, as against the Ter∣tenant, 8 Hen. 4.18. pl. 3. A Scire facias needs not be sued against the Tertenant before the Judgment be reversed, 47 Edw. 3.7. for before that the Tertenants estate is not stirred. But before that he enter, he shall have a Scire facias against the Tertenant, for otherwise he shall be a Disseisor, 4 Hen. 7.10. 47 Edw. 3.7. but by the Scire facias it appears that he enters not as a Disseisor. But if the Recoverer make a Feoffment to his own use, and then the Judgment be reversed,Feoffment there needs no Scire facias against the Feoffe; for this is aided per the Stat. of 1 Rich. 3. 26 Hen. 8.2. Scire faci∣as in Fe∣lony.Error upon an Outlawry in Felony, the Plaintiff ought to have a Scire facias to all the Lords, me∣diate or immediate, 7 Hen. 7.5.53. 4 Edw. 4.10. 11 Hen. 4. because they are intitled by the Outlawry.
And also against the party, at whose Suit and the Tertenants, Lib. Intra. 308 B. Sect. 3. And in a writ of Error,Delay. if the Plaintiff hasten not his Suit, the Defendant shall have a Scire facias against the Plaintiff, to shew cause why he should not have Execution, 24 Edw 3.24. 9 Hen. 6.13. or else he may proceed in Court to have the Judgment affirmed. And in such case upon two Nichils returned, the Defendant shall have execution, but after this the Plaintiff shall have a Scire facias, 9 Hen. 6.13. Q. for then it seems to be too late. Diminution in Error, 1. by whom; 2. in what cases, 3. at what time. 1. The Plaintiff in Error may alledge Dimi∣nution, Nat. br. 25 A. that is, alledge that a whole Record is not removed. The Defendant may do it also, 28 Hen. 6.11. 15 Eliz. Dyer 321. pl. 21. for if the Record be not wholly removed, the Court cannot judge of it, nor can the parties tell how to assign Errors; But this alledging of Diminution is now used mostly for delay. Error in London.2. Error upon a Judgment in London, the Re∣corder certifies the Record; yet he is held to do according to the custome. Quaere, if Diminution shall be alledged, 34 Hen. 6.42. it seems it should. When all the Record is not removed Diminu∣tion may be alledged, Nat. br. 25. A. vide the Writ there.
Diminution may be alledged in 1. The Essoin, Lib. Intra. 290. C. Sect. 1. 1 Hen. 7.2. 2. Continuance of the Jury, Lib. Intra. 290. D. Sect. 2. 3. Words in title in Assize, Lib. intra. 290. D. sect. 3. or any thing material in the body of the Record. Diminution shall not be alledged upon a Bill sealed, because the bill is not of Record, 11 Hen. 4.52. Hull, & 65. but is given in to the Court by him that takes the exceptions. 3. After in nullo est erratum pleaded in another Term, the Plaintiff may not alledge Diminution,Diminuti∣on. 28 Hen. 6.11. for then he hath pleaded to the Record as it is, and acknowledged it to be rightly removed. But the Defendant may, 28 Hen. 6.11. for he hath done nothing to conclude himself. But per 7 Edw. 4.25. Error 45. the Defendant may not. Q. But Coke 5. part. 37. B. Bishops case, after in nullo est erratum pleaded, no Diminution shall be alledged by either party; for if it should be suf∣fered, it would cause great delay. The Plaintiff to the Writ before that he assigns Errors, or a Scire facias ad audiend. errores may alledge diminution, and by this means the Defen∣dant may not afterwards alledge Diminution, 16 Eliz. Dyer 330. pl. 18. vide 13 Hen. 4 Error 92. because it is done already, and it seems it may not be twice done. But note,Note. that the Defendant after that he had rejoyned in the Writ, alledged Diminution, No. Lib. Intr. 232. B. Q.
The Plaintiff may not alledge Diminution for any Error in fact after a Scire facias awarded, 22 Edw. 4.45. but only for matter in Law; for the Scire facias admits the matter of fact to be right. The Assignment of Errors, 1. by whom; 2. at what time; 3. upon what Record; 4. of what things. Assignment of Errors is in place of a Decla∣ration, 9 Edw. 4.32. for therein the Plaintiff de∣clares, why the Defendant should not have execu∣tion upon his Judgment. Assign Errors.If one brings a Writ of Error, and he and ano∣ther assign Errors, this is good, as to him that brought the Writ of Error, and void as to the other, for that was but superfluous; but if two brought error, and one assign errors, this is not good to either, because the Writ was joynt, Mich. 9 Jac. in the Chequer Chamber, Shakely versus Porter. Conusor of a Fine shall not assign error in the Conusance to reverse his own Fine,Conusor. which is his own act; neither the Conusee in the Grant and Render, which is his act; neither the Recoverer in the Recovery, Coke 5. part. 39. B. for they ought not to defeat, but to maintain their own acts. Executor in Error by him upon a Judgment given against him,Executor. shall not assign for error, that the debt was but upon a simple Contract, Com. 182. A. 10 Hen. 6.24. for he might have pleaded it in barr of the Action.
Party shall not shew error in Process,Party. unless he shews that it is for his advantage in his prosecu∣tion, 7 Edw. 3.25. Coke 8. part. 59. A. Nat. br. 21. F. But may afterwards shew that the Judgment is erroneous by reason of such Error, Coke 8. part. 59. A. Beechers case, 14 Eliz. Dyer 315. pl. 99. and then is his proper time to do it. Reversioner not being made a party shall not assign for Error,Reversio∣ner. that the Sheriff made a warrant to the Baily to make a pannel where the party was guisdable, 3 Hen. 4.6. for the trial concerns him not. The Successor shall assign for error,Successor. that his Predecessor was but named Gardein, 15 Edw. 3. Error 7. where he ought to have been otherwise named. Error shall be assigned before a Scire facias shall be awarded, 24 Edw. 3.31. pl. 8.Scire fac. for that is the ground of the Scire facias. For after a Scire facias awarded the Plaintiff cannot assign error in deed, 22 Edw. 4.45. for upon the return of the Scire facias the Defendant is to come in, and to hear the errors assigned upon the Record. Upon a Judgment given upon a Demurrer in Law, and a Writ to enquire of dammages award∣ed,Demurrer. and a Writ to enquire of dammages award∣ed, a Writ of Error was brought, and he assigned errors, 17 Edw. 3.5. and good, as it seems. Quaere tamen. If the Record and the Writ of Error do not agree, Error cannot be assigned upon that Re∣cord,Record. Error cannot be assigned upon that Re∣cord, 9 Hen. 6.4. 2 Eliz. Dyer 180. pl. 48. 28 Hen. 6.11. for it shall not be judged to be
the same upon which the Writ of Error was brought. New Writ of Error.If the Writ of Error be faulty in substance, errors shall not be assigned upon the Record, but shall have a new Writ, Quod coram vobis residet, 3 Hen. 6.3. & 26.5 Mariae Dyer 164. pl. 58. that is, upon the Record, which is removed, and re∣mains where the new Writ is brought. False JudgmentBut if it be false Judgment, then there must be a new Writ to the Suitors, who were the Judges; for it is not of Record, 3 Hen. 6.26. Error without a day.If Error be put without a day, there shall be a new Writ before that error be assigned, 26 Hen. 6. Scire facias 33. Nat. b. 20. G. for the old Writ is null, and so the Judgment stands as if no writ had been brought. Bill sealed.Upon a Bill sealed a man shall assign error, per Westm. 2. cap. 31. 11 Hen. 4.52. 27 Hen. 8.15. 25. Coke 9. part. 13. B. Dowmans case, 9 Assize 8. 14 Hen. 4.15. 4 Hen. 6.15 A. Martin, 33 Hen. 6.34. Littleton pl. 9. 7 Hen. 6.37. 10 Hen. 7.8. And if the bill is refused to be sealed, the party shall have a writ to compel them to seal it, Regist. orig. 182. A, & B. But by Hill Justice it is intended of a thing pleaded in Court; for otherwise it shall not be sealed, for the Judges are not to take notice of it. Challenge in an Assize was put in a bill sealed,Challenge. and good, 9 Assize 8. 21 Edw. 4.11. 20 Edw. 3.63. Lib. Intra. 346. C. 27 Hen. 8.24, 25.
Priviledge claimed, and not allowed,Priviledge there may be a bill sealed, 22 Edw. 4. Priviledge 1. Conusance claimed,Conusance if the plea be challenged by one that is not party, there cannot be a bill sealed, 20 Edw. 3. Conusance 46. for it concerns him not. A Patent to three to take an Assize where two take it, there may be a bill sealed,Patent. and error upon it, 29 Assize 42. 11 Hen. 92. Assize,Bill sealed. the Tenant shews that the Sheriff was beyond Sea, and had a bill sealed of it. 1. Although the bill did bear date after the Record removed; yet it is good. 2. Although the party did not bring it within the bill, but the Justices; yet good. 3. The party shall have a writ to the Justices, commanding them to seal it, where they do re∣fuse to do it. 4. A writ to the Justices ad cognoscenda sigilla. vid. antea. 5. Two Justices seal it, yet one of them may deliver it; for the sealing, not the delivery, is the principal matter. 6. The party brought a Scire facias ad cog∣noscend. sigilla, before the Justices come in Court; yet good, for after that they come the bill was of Record ab initio, and so the Scire facias may have a good relation. Upon a transcript of the note of a Fine error shall be assigned,Transcript and if Error appears they shall send for the note it self, and reverse it, 21 Edw. 3.24. 16 Edw. 3. Record 35. 40 Assize pl. 29.
For otherwise perchance the Fine may not be ingrossed, which may prove mischievous, 1 Mariae Dyer 89. pl. 4. Lib. Intra. 296. A. sect. 1. Fines, Nat. br. 20. B. But note, 5 Mariae Dyer, Record 79. the Record shall be certified, and no other proclamation shall be made. This is intended of a Fine with Pro∣clamations. But 1 Mariae, Dyer 89. pl. 4. è contra. Ergo quaere. Upon a transcript in Parliament error is assign∣ed, for the Chief Justice brought up the Record, and reported it Ban. Regis, 8 Hen. 5. Error. 88. 23 Eliz. Dyer 375. pl. 19. 22 Edw. 3.3. pl. 25. But in another Court it is otherwise, 40 Assize 29. Nat. br. 20. F. Quaere rationem. It seems, be∣cause all Courts agree not in one way of proceed∣ings. Upon an award by the Justices upon return,Priviledge upon a writ of Priviledge, no writ of Error lies, Coke 8. part. 127. B. case of the City of London; for this is no judgment upon Record. Upon allowance of claim by the Justices of the Forest,Claim. 21 Edw. 3.48. pl. 70. error lies, vid. antea, for it is in nature of a Judgment. Record removed.Upon a Judgment in an annuity, and after that a Judgment in a Scire facias upon the judgment; Error is brought upon the former judgment, the Record shall be removed, 11 Hen. 4.4. viz. the whole Record, as it seems. Error upon a Fine with proclamations,Proclama∣tions. the proclamations shall be certified, Com. 265. A. Fishes case▪ for they are part of the Record by virtue of the Statute.
A Writ of Error shall not be awarded until the final judgment be given,Award. Coke 11. part. 40. A. Met∣calfs case, 7 Rich. 2. Error 68. for the tenour of the Writ supposeth the judgment to be given. Unless the Award be ad grave dampnum, Coke 11. part. 41. A. Metcalfs case; for then it seems a necessity to grant it before. As in Debt against many by several Praecipes, and judgment is given against one, he shall have error, and the pleadings shall be several from the original, and if Error be in the original, tenore tantum shall be certified, Coke. 11. part. 41. A. Judgment in an Account quod computet,Account. error lies not until the final judgment, Coke 11. part. 38. B. 21 Edw. 3.9. 1 Hen. 7.2. B. for the judg∣ment is not perfect and entire before, nor the Re∣cord made up. When an Action of Trespass is in part deter∣mined,Trespass. error lies not until it be determined all, 32 Hen. 6.5. pl. 5. 36 Hen. 6. Coke 11. part. 39. B. for before the whole Action is not determined, and so no compleat judgment. So in a Formedon, 12 Eliz. Dyer 291. pl. 67. Coke 11. part. 39. B.Formedon. So in Trespass against two,Trespass. 34 Hen. 6.41. pl. 9. So in a Quare Impedit, 34 Hen. 6.41.Quare Impedit. Partition. So in Partition, Mich. 40, & 41 Eliz. Com. Ban. Countess of Warwick against Henry Lord Bark∣ley. All upon the same ground. If error be brought before the fourth day in Com. Ban. yet it is good,Day. because of Record at the Commencement, 34 Hen. 6. Quaere, whether so in Banco Regis.
In an Assize of Darrein Presentment, a Writ was awarded to the Bishop, and the Assize is for dammages, error brought and allowed, 17 Edw. 3.5. pl. 12. for this was a judgment. Error upon a judgment in a Scire facias upon a Fine,Record. and no Record removed, but the pro∣ceedings upon the former judgment, and yet good, 20 Edw. Error 2. viz. the Fine which is a Judgment in its nature, and the Scire facias is but to have Execution upon it; yet it seems better, if all were removed. Praecipe quod red∣dat.Upon a Praecipe quod reddat judgment is given; and error brought; the original, nor the judicial Writ, nor the essoyn shall be removed, 2 Edw. 3. Error 2. Thorpe 37. Assize 5. but only the Record of the judgment; for there the error is only sup∣posed. Unless Error be assigned in the Original, 24 Edw. 3.24. and then it must be removed, viz. the te∣nour of it. And then the transcript of the Record only shall be removed,Transcript 34 Assize 7. 36 Hen 6.13. for the Record is supposed not to be erroneous. Error upon an execution upon a Statute-Mer∣chant,Statute-Merchant. and error in process assigned, the original shall be removed, 18 Edw. 3.24. for the original is part of the process. Ancient Demean.And if it be of Ancient demesn Lands, the O∣riginal shall be removed, 34 Assize 7. out of that Court. But Error upon a judgment in Ireland, the O∣riginal shall not be removed, 74 Assize 7. 37 Assize 15. Finchden. Quaere rationem; it seems, because it is a Record of another Kingdom.
Fine and Recovery.Error lies not upon a Fine or Common reco∣very for false Latin, rasure, interlining, mis-entry of the warrant of Attorney, Proclamation mis-returned, or not return of the Sheriff, or default of form in words, 23 Eliz. cap. 3. This Statute was made in favour of Fines, and to sup∣port them, because they are the common Assu∣rances of the land. And by 27 Eliz. cap. 9. this extends to Fines in Wales, and Recoveries there. But if the fine be passed before the Kings Sil∣ver be entred, it is Error, No. Lib. Intra. 231. A. sect. 2. viz. for the not entring of it; which is paid pro licentia concordandi. If a Writ of Covenant be returned before the Teste, this shall be amended, Coke 5. part. 45. B. Gages case; for it is the misprision of the Clerk. The Caption before the Teste of the Dedimus, is no error, No. Lib. Intra. 255. C. Sect. 11. for the same reason. Pasch. 1. Jacobi Regis, Rot. 426. the Countess of Bedford against Foster, 1. Error assigned was, because the Writ of Covenant was of eight Mes∣suages and two Tofts, and the Fine certified is of eight Messuages and two Messuages, but non allo∣catur, because the Record hath relation to the Writ of Covenant. 2. Error assigned, because the Indorsement was Executio istius brevis patet in quadam panella &c. where it should be in qua∣dam schedula, sed non allocatur, because in substance it is the same thing, expressed by divers names. Mich. 30 Eliz. Ban. Regis, Austein & Steede versus Conaway & Webbe, a Fine was levied of
two Tenements, and void, because a Praecipe lies not of it; this case is entred, Hill. 30 Eliz. Rot. 165. for a Tenement is a thing incertain, of which a Fine cannot be levied. Infancy good Error in a Fine,Infancy. Nat. br. 21. D. 3 Hen. 6.16. B. 2 Rich. 3.1. 17 Edw. 3.53. pl. 33. 27 Assize pl. 53. if it be brought during his Mi∣nority, that he may be inspected by the Court, and his Age proved. But if he come to full age it is not; for then he is not in the same condition as he was when he levied the Fine, 17 Edw. 3.53. pl. 33. Greene, 17 Assize pl. 17. no can it be so well tried. And although the other ject a protection, yet if the Infant be inspected when he comes to full age, he shall have the benefit of his nonage, 22 Edw. 3.6. pl. 24. 21 Assize pl. 10. for the Infant could not proceed to reverse the Fine during his Infancy, by reason of the protection. Feme Covert.Feme Covert, as Feme sole, levies a Fine, this shall bind all but the Husband, Coke 7. part. 8. Bedfords case, 17 Edw. 3.52; & 78. 7 Hen. 4.23. because as to him she was covert, and could not act without him, though not in respect of o∣thers. But if the Husband enters and dies,Husband. the Fine is void without more suit to all parties concerned, Coke 7. part. 8. Bedfords case, 7 Hen. 4.2.23. for that shews his disagreement to his Wives act. But if living the former Husband, and she take a second Husband, and they levy a Fine; this is utterly void, because the second Marriage is void, 7 Hen. 4.24. B. Gascoign, 9 Hen. 6.34. B.
pl. 3. This was before the Statute of Jac. a∣gainst having two wives or two husbands. Note,Note: when a thing is amendable before the Writ of Error brought, it is amendable as well after, and this by a Superiour Court, as well as an Inferiour Court, Coke 8. part. 162. A. Blacka∣mores case; for the Writ of Error doth not hin∣der such amendments. Note,Note. that those things that are not amendable and yet vicious, are Errors at this day, for there is no other way to redress them. When Judgment is given, but not upon a ver∣dict of 12. upon Issue joyned, there are 7 Errors not amendable, Coke 8. part. 162. A. Blackamores case; as upon a Judgment by default, by Nihil dicit, non sum informatus, or upon a Demurrer, &c. Vid. some alterations by a late Statute temps Caroli Secundi, concerning Errors. Want of the Original Writ,1. Original. No. Lib. Intra. 246. D. Misprision of the form of the Original,2. Form. false Latin in it, or variance from the Register. Material variance between the Original and the Count or Declaration,3. Count. as C.W. in the Writ, and W. W. in the Count, Coke 5. part. 37. Bishops case. Jeosail,4. Plead∣ing. fault of Colour, insufficient pleading, or some default of the person, or of his Coun∣sel. Error, or misprision of the Judges in another Term, Misericordia pro Capiatur, & è contra, Coke 8. part. 59. A. 41 Eliz. Dyer 315. pl. 99. Want of warrant of Attorney.6. War∣rant.
Error in pleas of the Crown and Appeals,7. Appeal. or in proceedings upon them, they are not amendable, for they are excepted out of the Statute of A∣mendments; and also Error in the exigent to make one to be outlawed, Coke 8. part. 162. A. Blackamores case, Br. 10. This is in favour of life and liberty, and property. What things are amendable after ver∣dict. 1. Material variance.When Judgment is given upon a verdict of 12. men, upon issue joyned, there are 10. Mispri∣sions not to be remedied or amended, Coke 8. part. 163. Blackamores case. Material variance between the Original and the Count, Coke 5. part. 37. Bishops case. The Original is Barbara, and the Count is Bar∣baria; this is erroneous, Mich. 9 Jac. Ban. Regis, Harrison & Fettiplace, for they are two several names, and so may be two several persons. Waste brought in Burrum Appleby, and Flack∣bridge, and the Count is of waste made in Bur∣rum Appleby & Flackbridge Park in Langton, and it is variance, because there is more in the Count than in the Writ, Hill. 12 Jac. Com. Ban. Coun∣tess of Cumberlands case, and so it may not be for one and the same matter. When the Original and the Count differs in the substance, Coke 5 part. 45. Husband and wife brought debt, or an Action for rent due to them, where it was due to the wife before Coverture; this is aided by the Sta∣tute, and good after verdict, Trin. 9 Jac. Ban. Re∣gis, Peore versus Boule. Hill. 36. Eliz. Ban. Regis, Rot. 610. Griffin versus Elliot.
Ejectione firmae wants (vi & armis) this is but a fault in form; and shall not stay Judgment after Verdict; and then it was also said, that these words are not material, for it may be without them, 7 Hen. 6.4. 17 Edw. 3.1. Q. 3. Mispri∣sion of the Visne.When the Venue is mistaken. The Issue was, that within the Mannor of War∣grave, and it was of the Mannor of Wafield, de∣misable by Copy of Court Roll, &c. the Venue was of the Mannor of Wargrave, and good, be∣cause the issue was upon the Custome within the Mannor of Wargrave, Coke 11. part. 18. A. Ne∣vils case; but if one Mannor was in one County, and another in another, then it is otherways, Mich. 11 Jac. Ban. Regis, in the same case; for then that Jury could not try the issue. 1. Trin. 11 Jac. Ban. Regis, Morton versus Orde, resolved in a Writ of Error 1. Infancy during Nonage shall be tried by the Justices by inspection and other proof in Court, Coke 9. part. 30. 17 Edw. 2. Account 122. 46 Edw. 3.8. 48 Edw. 3.11. 14 Hen. 4. after Nonage by a Jury. 2. If it be doubtful to the Justices, the Infant and the Witnesses shall be examined in Court, 25 Edw. 3.42. 50 Edw. 3.5. 3. If he be of full age in Actions reals, it, viz. the Issue, shall be tried where the Land lies, 21 Edw. 3.28. 38 Edw. 3.17. 44 Assize 10. 46 Edw. 3.7. 13 Hen. 4.3. 19 Hen. 6.51. for the Land is the principal matter. 4. If it be an Action personal as Ejectione firmae, it shall be tried where the Action is brought, 21 Edw. 3.7. 3 Hen. 6.40. 34 Hen. 6.50.
and so it was adjudged, because it is transitory, and not fixt to a place. 4. Sheriffs Retorn.When the Retorn is by the Sheriff, where it ought to be by the Coroners, or è converso; for such is no retorn, because made by a wrong Offi∣cer. When the Sheriff puts not his name to the Re∣torn of the Jury,5. Jury. as he ought to do; for else it cannot be known to be his Retorn. 6. Venire facias.When there is no Retorn indorsed upon the Venire facias, so if the name of the Sheriff be not put to the Writ of Inquiry of Dammages, Mich. 9. Jac. in the Chequer Chamber, Shackly versus Porter, for these are things of sub∣stance. When one gives the Verdict that was not re∣turned in the Venire facias,7. Verdict. though he be sworn. When it appears to the Court by all the Record,8. Action. that the Plaintiff had no cause of Action; for the Court is to judge of the Record. In Appeal,9. Crown. or Pleas of the Crown, or in any proceedings upon them. Antea. Statutes penal.Or to the Writ, Bill, or Action, Informations, upon popular or penal Statutes. 10. Law. Judgment.Error in Law by misprision of the Judges in the judgment entred in another term, Coke 5. part. 57. B. Specots case; but in the same term it may, because all that term the judgment is in the breast of the Judges. Action upon the Case in Cur. Wallingford, the judgment was, quod defend. capiatur; this is Er∣ror, being but an Action upon the case, Trin. 9 Jac. Ban. Regis, Northcot versus Heywood, for the Judge ought to be defendens in misericordia; for
it is capiatur only where the Action is vi & ar∣mis, in respect of the fine to the King. Concessum est pro Con∣sideratum est.Concessum est, where it should be Consideratum est; this is Error, although there are 21. Presi∣dents in my Lord Cokes Reports to the contrary, for by Man Secondary the Books are false printed, Mich. 8. Jac. Ban. Regis, Rot. 641. and by Williams, if it be videbitur Curiae; this is erroneous, for the Court is not to vary from their forms in such high matters as Judgment are. If it be Capiatur against the Defendant in an Ejectione firmae, Mich. 8 Jac. Ban. Regis, Rot. 232. Dolby versus Holbrook, it is error, for it should be ideo in misericordia. Jurisdictiō of Court.It is ordained per 27 Eliz. cap. 8. that if Error be brought in the Chequer upon a judgment in Ban. Regis, they shall not assign it in the Juris∣diction of the Court, or in form of the Writ, Return, Plaint, Bill, Declaration, Pleading, Pro∣cess, Verdict, or Proceedings; but only insist up∣on the matter in Law. And also there is a Proviso, that it shall be in Debt, Detinue, Account, Covenant, Ejectione firmae, Traverse, Action upon the Case; and not in other Actions of a higher nature. In processThe party cannot shew Error in Process in delay of the Defendant, unless he shew that it is for his disadvantage, and that he is injured there∣by, 7 Edw. 3.25. Coke 8. part. 59. A. Beechers case. Nothing that is done contrary to the Office of a Judge shall be assigned for Error,Judge. Nat. br. 21. B. 7 Hen. 7.4. for their Authority shall not be que∣stioned this way.
Granting of Aid where it should not be, is not Error, so of Receipt, 7 Edw. 4.12. 21 Edw. 4.65 B. 5 Hen. 7.8. 8 Hen. 7.9, 11. 14 Hen. 6.5. pl. 25. but if it be denied where it ought to be granted, it is Error; for none is prejudiced by the former, but by the latter the Defendant is prejudiced. So of Garnishment, 14 Edw. 4.1. pl. 3. So of making of an Attorney, Nat. br. 22. D. 21 Edw. 4.77. But denial of Aid or Receipt,Visne. where it ought to be, is Error, Edw. 4.65. B. 5 Hen. 7.8. 8 Hen. 7.9. vid. antea. When the Visne is mistaken,Visne. it is error, for there is no right trial. In Reple∣vin.Replevin, the Defendant prescribes to have all the Pasture of such a place in W. except Com∣mon for the Inhabitants of D. and the Prescrip∣tion being traversed, the Jury was of the Visne of W. only; and this was ruled good in Error brought, because the words of exception to the Inhabitants of D. was void, therefore this was not put in issue, Trin. 11 Jac. Ban. Regis, Wicker versus Stockeman, and so nothing in Dale was put in issue. In wasteIn Waste brought, the Issue was for certain Oaks cut for repairing of the Castle of Burrum, the Visne was of the Village of Burrum, where it should have been of the Castle of Burrum, this is Eror, Hill. 12 Jac. Com. Ban. the Countess of Cumberlands case, for a Castle and a Village are two different places.
Trover & Conversi∣on.Trover and Conversion brought in Coventry, upon not guilty pleaded, the Visne was De Vi∣cineto Civitatis Coventriae, and this shewed in ar∣rest of judgment, sed non allocatur, and error up∣on in brought, and it seems that by Williams and Yelverton Justices, that it is error; for it should be of Coventry; for Vicinetum is of the Neigh∣borhood of Coventry, and excludes the City, and the Sheriff of the Country ought to make it out, 7 Hen. 6.36. B. 4 Edw. 4.39. 7 Hen. 4.12.80. In∣quest 36. Quare tamen; for the Court did ad∣vise about bringing of a new Action, and did not determine the Question, Pasch. 9. Jac. Ban. Regis, Procter versus Clifton. Trespass for lopping of Wood in Hurslay,Trespass. the Defendant pleads that the place is parcel of the Mannor of Mamden in the Parish of Hurslay, and the Custom is, that the Copy-holder may cut, &c. and found for the Plaintiff, and the Visne was of Hurslay, and it was moved that it was not good, for the Parish is not certain, because it may comprehend more Villages; but it was good per Curiam, because Hurslay shall be taken to be a Village and Parish, and shall not be intended, that there are more Villages in one Parish, ex∣cept it be shewed, 5 Edw. 3.20. Mich. 9. Jac. Ban. Regis, Brocke versus Spencer. Condition to pay money.Hill. 9. Jac. Ban. Regis, Savil & Cavendish, Condition to pay money in the Church porch of the Parish of H. and pleads performance, the Visne was of H. and yet good, for as it seems the Village and Parish shall be intended all one, and the Parish shall not be intended to comprehend more Villages.
Debt upon an Obligation to perform Cove∣nants,Obligati∣on. and declares of the breaking of the Condi∣tion, because a stranger recovered the Land at Westminster upon a good title, where the Land lies in Com. Berks, the Defendant said that it was by Covin, without this, that it was upon a good Title, the Plaintiff said that it was upon a good Ti∣tle the Visne shall be of the County of Berks, where the Issue is joined upon the good Title, and where the Land lies, but contrary if the issue be joined upon the Covin; for that is alledged at West∣minster, but it was said, if it were a personal A∣ction, it shall be where the Recovery is alledged, Mich. 9. Jac. Ban. Regis, Hansaker versus Kirby. Ejectione firmae of Land in S & T the Defendant pleads a Feoffment of the Land by Deed at S. the Plaintiff said non feoffavit,Ejectment &c. the Visne was of S. and T. and good; for the alledging of the Feoffment at S, is idle; for it cannot be but upon the Land which is alledged to be in S. and T. Mich. 9. Jac. Ban. Regis. and so the Venue is rightly laid there. Debt for 20 l. the Defendant pleads that at ano∣ther time the Plaintiff sued him in London,Debt. in such a Parish for the same debt, and shews the Record certain, &c. and that he had execution in another Parish, &c. the Plaintiff said that it was in debt for another 20 l. for the which execution was awarded absq, hoc that the plaint and the executi∣on was for the same 20 l. yet the Visne shall be in both Parishes, because the issue is as well of the execution as of the plaint, 5 Edw. 4.110. A vouches B, who vouches C, and after issue tried, the former Vouchee, viz. B. dies, this shall
not be pleaded in arrest of judgment against A, but it is error, if judgment be given, 21 Hen. 7.80. pl. 1. Crooke, but if A die, it shall abate the Writ in facto, ibidem. because he is Defendant, and so no judgment can be given. In detinue against A, he prays garnishment against B, which comes and pleads, and they are at issue, A dies, the Writ abates, ibidem. Bar in Error. No bar to say that the former Writ depending,Feofment the Plaintiff did infeoff another; for he remains Tenant notwithstanding the Feoffment, 21 Edw. 3.53. 20 Assize 2. 12 Assize 41. Coke. 1. part 111. Albanyes case; because the Feoffment was made pendente lite. In nullo est erratum.In nullo est erratum, a good Bar, 28 Hen. 6.10. 9 Edw. 4.32. 15 Eliz. Dyer 321. pl. 21. For it de∣stroys the very supposal of the Writ. But note upon Error in Deed this is no plea. 7 Edw. 4.16. 9 Edw. 4.32. 3 Edw. 6. Dyer 65.2 Mariae, Dyer. 104. pl. 10. Lib. intra. 288. D. sect. 1.289. D. sect. 1. No. Lib. intra. 233. B. be∣cause that doth not appear upon the Record. Release of Errors is a good Bar,Release. 20 Edw. 3. Er∣ror 2. Littleton 116 B. Coke 8. part 152. Althams case. 6 Hen. 4.8. pl. 36. 5 Edw. 4.96. B. For the release of Errors makes the judgment good, were it never so vicious. But a release of Actions reals and personals it is no Bar in error of an Outlawry, Coke S. part. 152. Littleton, 116. B. For the Outlawry con∣cerns the Commonwealth, which interest cannot be released by a private person.
If the Defendant be outlawed in Redisseisin, a release of all demands is no Bar, because the Ori∣ginal and the Judgment are the process upon the Outlawry. 11 Hen. 4.6. The Release of the Vouchee shall bar the Te∣nant, 17 Edw. 2. Error 90. for the Tenant reco∣vers in value against him. Release of Errors by Tenant in Tail, is no bar to the issue, although it be tried against the Te∣nant in Tail, 3 Eliz. Dyer 188. pl. 9. For the is∣sue in Tail is not bound by the judgment; for the issues derives paramount the tenant in Tail, viz. performam doni. But if he in reversion in Tail disseises Tenant in Dower, and suffers an erroneous Recovery, and Tenant in Dower releases with warranty, and dies, this is a good Bar, Coke 3. part 60, 61. Lincolne Colledge case; because the recovery cut off the entail. A Release of one bars another, when two are to recover a personal thing in respect of their joint-interest; but when they are to dischage themselves, it is otherwise, Coke 6. part 25. Rud∣docks case. As where an Action is brought against two jointly to one thing, it seems if one confess the Action, this shall not bind the other. If an Action be brought against two jointy, and a judgment is thereupon had against them, and one of them releaseth errors, this shall not hinder the other to bring a Writ of Error, because he is to be charged by the judgment. The King brought Error,Scisune. it is no plea, that his Ministers have seized the Land, unless the King agree to it, 39 Assize pl. 18. For the King shall
not be bound by the Act of his Officers without his consent. Yet Q. if it be done by an Officer of Record. The Judgment in Error. 1. For the Plaintiff. 2. For the Defendant. 3. For both. In Error two things are to be done. 1. To reverse the judgment. 2. That the party be re∣stored to all that he lost by reason of the judg∣ment, 9 Hen. 6.47. B. Martin. Coke 5. part 39. B. Tayes case. Q. Whether he shall be satisfied for all his dammages? It seems he shall. The judgment was that the Plaintiff should not be restored to the Land,Assise. with the mean pro∣fits, 11 Hen. 4: 93. pl. 49. Q. For a several A∣ction lies for the mean profits. And 8 Hen. 6.2. A. Rolfe, that he shall reco∣ver the Land and the Issues of the Land, that is, the profits. Informati∣on upon Intrusion.The judgment was, Quod judicium reversetur & adunlletur, & quod Defendens de intrasione, intrusio∣ne, transgressione & contemptu, convincatur, & à possessione amoveatur & capiatur, &c. quodque re∣cordum mittatur in Scaccarium pro executione ha∣benda, &c. Coke 1. part 40. A. Altonwoods case. The Action and judgment were in the Exche∣quer. In a Quare Impedit, that former judgment should be void,Quare im∣pedit. and the Plaintiff restored to all that he lost, 18 & 19 Eliz. Dyer 353. pl. 30. Gardein recovers in a Quare Impedit in right of the Ward, the Defendant at full age of the Ward brought error, and a Scire facias against
the Ward, the Ward entitles himself by his anci∣ent right, and found for him. 1. The judgment shall be reversed against the Gardein, and yet the Defendant shall not be restored, because he is bar∣red by the plea of the Ward, 9 Hen. 6.47.: B. Newton. The judgment was, that the judgment shall be reversed,Redisseisin and that the Plaintiff be restored to the Land, and to the issues taken in the mean time, 9 Hen. 4.6. pl. 19. that is, to the mean profits of the Land taken pendente lite. The judgment was upon an Utlawry in felony,Utlawry. that the Utlawry should be reversed, and he re∣stored at the common Law to all that he had lost by this cause, 11 Hen. 4.53. pl. 32. 7 Hen. 4.40. B. And that he should be restored at the Common Law to that he had lost, 3 Eliz. Dyer 196. pl. 39. viz. by reason of the Owtlawry. Error by Executors of the Testators being utlawed was, that the Utlawry be reversed, and that they shall be restored to the goods of their Testator, seized by reason of it, 11 Hen. 4.65. pl. 22. It shall be Quod judicium redditum staret in omni robore per Coke Chief Justice, Pasc. 12. Jac. Ban. Regis, Sir John Heydons case; and yet 21 Edw. 4.44. A. was quod judicium redditum remanebit stabile in perpetuum, nor the form is let judgment be affirmed. Et ulterius concessum est, quod praedictus A, recu∣peret versus praefat.This is the Judgment for dm∣nges. B. 10. l.eidem A. per Curiam Domini Regis hic adjudicat. juxta formam Statuti inde nuper edit. &c. promisis & costagiis & dampnis
suis quae sustinuit occasione dilatationis executionis praedict. praetextu prosecutionis dicti brevis Domini Regis de errore, &c. Lib. intra. 244. B. sect. 8. & 292. B, By the Statute of 3 Hen 7. cap. 10. if error be sued before execution, and afterwards be discon∣tinued by default of the party that brings it, or he be nonsuited, or judgment affirmed, the other shall recover his costs and dammages by the dis∣cretion of the Judges. An Infant and another levie a Fine, this may be reversed to the Infant by a Writ of Error, but it shall be good against the other, Coke 1. part 76. B. Bredons case. No. Lib. intra. 255. C. sect. 11. For the Fine shall stand good as far as by Law it may. But if the Husband and Wife levy a Fine of the Land of the Wife, and they reverse it for Error, they shall be restored forthwith, because the Hus∣band is joyned with his Wife but for conformity, Coke 2. part 77. B. Cromwels case. For the Estate passeth only from the Wife. Though Execution be reversed, the judgment is yet good, Coke 5. part 32. Pettifers case; and a new Execution may be taken out. A Fine reversed for fault in the Proclamations only, remains a good Fine at the common Law; for the other is but a Discontinuance, 4 Eliz. Dyer, pl. 54. and is nothing to vitiate the Fine. Execution in Error. Lib. intra. 307. C. sect. 1. FINIS.
