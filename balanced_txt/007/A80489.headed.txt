❧ The Copy of a Letter, sent from Two thou∣sand Youthfull Citizens, to the Menacing Marshall of the Kings-Bench, Sir John Lenthall. Sir, IT is not unknown to you, that many of your right-despising faction have wrongfully termed us irregular Round-heads, and self-will'd Seperatists; but our well grounded Actions, shall publish to the world, as well the serenity of our inten∣tion, as the verity of your delusion; For though we be Round-headed, we are not hollow hearted; And if we do affect retired separation, it follows we must hate an insinua∣ting Companion; such as you are, and would be, could you illegally get (where your conversation's not desired) an unjust possession; which (notwithstanding your power with the Judges, and many unmanly me∣nacies) your sinister endeavour shall never obtain; We being unanimously re∣solved at an houres warning, to meet you armed, and give Battalia to the Sheriff of Surrey, if he be so fool-hardy as to assist you in the justification of so palpable an injury. For we (who are the reall honourers of the Name, and memory of the Middletons) will not see the sonne of that never enough honoured Father, who was the glory of our City, unjustly suffer by a litigious Jackallent; but in vindication of his lawfull Title, will unhouse our swelling veines of every warm tennantable drop within them. Therefore in due consideration of our fixed resolution, we friendly do advise you, at length to leave of all your hate procuring undertakings, that make you despicable to the knowing world, and only, to attempt honest and noble things that are bravely justifiable, and that alone can return you amiable to those, who are rather, the desirers of your conversion, then confusion. Dated die Martis, secundo Martj, Anno Revocationis Primo. Your friends, or otherwise, as you make them, Middeltoni-Anti-Lenthalliani. MIDDLIILLLII. March 4. London, Printed by John Raworth. 1641.
