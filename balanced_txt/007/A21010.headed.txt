The prayse of Nothing. By E. D. ❧ Imprinted at London, in Fleete∣streate, beneath the Conduite, at the signe of S. Iohn Euangelist, by H. Iackson. 1585.
❧ The prayse of Nothing. DIuers of singuler reputation, to recreate themselues from their grauer studies, haue after the nature of their conceytes written diuersly, & that of such matter, which in the opinion of the people, seemed not worthy the pen of a meane scholler: in which notwith∣standing, they shewed no small argument of their greate iudgment, that erred at no time lesse, thē when it apeared most idle, and looslye giuen. For as in the quiet times of states well gouerned, Souldiers trained with shewes of no danger, and exercised in pleasant marches, feruentlye couet the hazarde of battle: so returned those rare men, from their lighter labors, more resolute, to beare the heauy burden of their ancient studies. By imitation of whome maye the meaner sorte, being also wearied with other ac∣cedents of the worlde, vndertake the like (as the poore help of cuntrey musicke for a plowemans dumpe) with no lesse warrantise, then the sheapheard may the vse of his Ofen pipe, Princes hauing the Cornet, & other excellent Instru∣ments. For to men that differ in no other circumstance, thē the fauorable aspect of Fortune, hath Nature, being as good mother to the Ideot, as the greatest clarke, vsed for one sort of sicknes, a like methode of cure, as a meane to mound hir children with the true knowledge of themselues, by which their societie, and mutuall good will is maintained. Thys equitie in nature hath moued mée, as a lenetiue of the mind (though beside my infirmities, I haue many things in com∣mon with others) to enterprise the praise of Nothing:
which I confesse might haue had more ornament, if it had fallen in the handes of the learned, by whose labors the weaknesse of the subiect might haue béene holpen. Yet for y• betwéene the déepth of their skil, and the shallownés of this matter, there is small proportion: I thought the same more agreable for my selfe, whose iudgement hath néerest con∣formitie therewith. Whilest I endeuored to shun Agrippas vanities, and Erasmus follyes, as one that might haue béene a paterne of either, I cloathed with bare garments this treatise: for equity would not that Drones féede with the Muses birds, neither that Arachne weaue in the frames of Minerua. My purpose hath not béene to publishe any thing contrary to pi∣etie (which with many obseruances, I haue regarded) or in beguiling the time, in which I salue my owne sores, to wounde the wandering appetite of such as hunt nouelties, and ingorge themselues with euery poison, that hath either his outwarde forces alaide wyth swéete smelles, or sauorie tasts. But I who had rather bréede no delight, then betraie the sences, haue in consideration therof, put this Caueat, that those fictions which be without order scattered in this pamphlet, be for no other cause layde downe, then to péece with phantasticke artificers, the defects of their inuencion: none being so hardy to drawe Venus without hir Uaile, or Mars vnarmed. The weake helpe of these supposes, I submit to the lear∣ned censure of the godly, who knowe them to be no other∣wise parte of any worke, then steyning coullers of one na∣ture, with the table or linnen hanging. I meane not to be iealous of the good report of this trea∣tise, as Appelles was of his picture: but giue leaue for all sorts to reprehende me for nothing, for whose sake I haue made apparance of some enmitie to all thinges, neither to impunge any ground of equitie, but to take such measure as I haue powred to others; of whome I entreate no other fa∣uour,
then that they thinke it the labor of him, who win∣deth quils for the web of Penelope. The quarrel is not yet ended, which hath risen amongst the anciente Phylosophers, touching the originall of the worlde, which some will haue to concerne only the earth, & hir contents: others the mighty frame of the vniuersall: e∣uery one setting downe his seuerall reason, as being loath to haue séemed ignorante of those great matters: when to things in which they had more interest, being of one crea∣tion with the heauens, and the earth, they were mere stran∣gers, for that light of which Zacharie and the Euangeliste spake, had not then shined to them, by which they mighte thorough the thicke clowdes of nature behold themselues, a knowledge discended from heauen. For whilst they tra∣ueyled (Curiositie being their guid) to find out in the num∣bers of Pythagorus, the moets of epicure, and seperated for∣mes of Democrates, the naturall cause of the worlde, they reuealed by chance, the true procreation of nothing: as men in séeking Mines doe first finde water, without which there is no store of Mettle congealed. This labor although it were not, in dangers equall to those of Herculs, yet is it worthy of great praise, in bring∣ing to light a discent further, then was eyther knowne to Vlpian, or the learned Heraulds of that time, since which, no man hath medled therin: they only endeuoring to fynd out the originall of Nilus, the causes of his inundations and ebs: the vehement motions of the Aire, and earth, the mo∣uing of the planets, their Eclipses, and other accedents. The prophane antiquitie therefore, vnlesse by casuall meanes, entreated little hereof, as of that which by their rule, y• Nihilex Nihilo fit, conteined not matter of profit, or commendation: for which those Phylosophers hunted, as ambicious men for dominion and empire. Leauing there∣fore (as men impatient to abide without the vaine praises of the people) that difficult and lawdable enterprise to the
posteritie of the children of God, they gaue themselues to be authors of many parcialities and sectes: But these latter sort; vpon whose backs this charge was cast, after they had beheld the state of all thinges, perceiued the cause of their production, to consist of a nature more excellent thē they were of: which being without the compasse of their schole causes, must of necessytie be ascribed vnto the won∣derfull omnipotencie of God, who by his diuine wisdome, composed the vniuersall substance of nothing: which is by so much of greater dignitie, by howe much it hath rather pleased the creator to fram therof the worthyest creatures. And though it liked Tully, to name the reuealing of these misteries to the multitude, great impietie: yet thinke I it necessary, as a meane to attaine to the true knowledge of God, and our selues: of God, who making all thinges for man of nothing, is preched to vs by the architecture of this mightie engin of the world: of our selues, who being made of reasonable soules, & bodyes, pertake both of the natures of Angells, and brute beasts: to that ende, we embase not with abiecte mindes the excellency of the first, or raise the second higher, then is agreable to our strength. For that sub∣stance, which we communicate with Angels, being created of nothing, draweth vs by a secreter property, to the contem∣plation of heauenly things, then the Adament doth Iron the other, being a natiue of the earth, inclineth vs by a naturall impultion, to fire our care theron, til we fall groueling from al duetie, and (being subiect to diuerse alterations, and chan∣ges, either increasing, or decreasing with the moone, are fy∣nallye eclipsed with the graue. This is therfore a matter to be regarded of them, which be rockt in the pleasures of this worlde, that the bouye being one discent more from nothing then the soule, is by many degrées further from all vertue thē the same: & that so long, as we reteined ye simple of our be∣gining, we were (as hauing our minds regolated by the good order of nature) the louers of vertue. But after that the com∣poundes
of the serpent, and our first parents, had rooted in vs these posessiues, Meum et tuum, (the elements of ambi∣cion) we declined from that age, which in respect of this, & the innocency of that time, was named golden: tasting in lieue of the pleasant fruits of ye Orcharde of Eden, the sower leauen of the first error: which so corrupted the whole state of the worlde, that as by mo ages, it stoode further remoued from the time of his creation: tooke it also, being newly se∣perated from pietie, new names, with which, his honora∣ble title was extinguished, as hauing no other effects then of iron, and therfore now named therof. In this proportion, is there to be obserued, the nature of both the mettles, if iron be to be named one, which maketh for this matter in hand. For as gold (being made of no∣thing, reteineth still his naturall propertie, and substance) neither yéelding to the moistnes of the water, or consuming by the extreame furie of the fire, is the tipe of those, who despysing all things, are afflicted for vertue: so iron being artificially made of stones, and shewing by his rust, the vn∣euen temperature of the elements, & malitious influence of the planets in his composition, prefigureth the vngodly estate of man, wasted by the flame of concupisence, & canc∣ker of loose lyfe. The meane to attaine perfection, is eyther to returne to that of which al things were created, or to be stil endowed with the simple of the first creation: which neither ye lower heauens, that ouer spreade the worlde with their beautiful lights, or the earth which is conteined in the midst of them, are: it being pronounst by the Psalmist, that they shal waxe old as doth a garment: which proueth their vertue by suc∣cession of times, to diminishe, and not to be of such efficacie in working, as when they were created of nothing: since which time, the one hath for our sinnes put on the nature of Brasse, and the other of Iron: as qualities hauing affinitie with our corruption, which were to be restored by those
things, in which it hath offended, but that the abundaunte mercie of God dispaireth, for the nurrishment of his crea∣tures, with this rule of iustice. The heauenly politicke in reforming the disorders of his common weale, referreth vs to the beginning, in which was neither corruption of law, or nature: the like haue his disciples done, as to that where lieth no suspition of il mea∣ning. But such as be croked followers of this company, & iealious of the godly antiquitie, make all beginninges doubtfull, which are of more age then themselues: and as men vtterly ignorante of the gréeuous soers of their natu∣ral cuntrie, name nothing the cause. Our soueraign gouer∣nes, applieth the easiest remedies of godly surgerie, for preseruation of the whole bodye: but in this, they be no o∣therwise deceiued, then in those actions which be squared with the rule of error. For as these Mal Contents, of the vatiean Serraglio, vse (contrary to the sincere purity of the sacred word, and imitation of the holy Fathers) prophane and supersticious worshipping of God, in stead of adoring him in truth, and veritie: in like manner, haue many enor∣mities béene perpetrated for nothing, with no lesse furie, then as though all the powers of nature, had consented to beate reason from the stearne, and to sincke the vessell of sound iudgement: to which notwithstanding, we ought not to attribute the cause of ill effects: The goodnes of wine being not impaired, though some take the Moone for a can∣dle, or the Sunne vnprofitable, for that others are scorched with the heate: which hurt not in respect of their qualities, but by meane of the pacients indisposition: so nothing, en∣tering the emptie mindes of diuers personages, with that motiue, which some schole men doubt to make either an ac∣cedent, or a substance, and therfore by cōiecture nothing also: stirreth them (as the aire of the fire, moueth either lighte or dry things) by some power of the first nature: from which because they as now excluded: they followe their seuerall
affections, whether it be in graue or lighte matter, as Wolues quarrelling with lambs, for troubling the treme beneath them, or men séeking cudgels to beate dogges for waging their tailes. For proofe, let vs descend to a perticu∣ler example of the way warde qualities of olde age: which though it be reuerenced with many ceremonies, and enter∣teyned with no commodities of the world: yet remaineth it inpacient of either fortune, consuming for nothing in great frowardnes, the residue of their brittle yeares: or as fondly turning ouer the leaues of their last times, as hauing put of the sobrietie of ancient men, or the shamfastnes of young childrē: bestow the remnant of their life in making Sonets, in smothing their wrinckled skin, coulloring their white haires, perfuming ye venimus exhalations of their stomaks, & carrolling we ratling voyce their amorous Villanella: al∣though without hazarding the losse of some tooth, they open not their hanging chappes, more fearfull then the graue. Many other thinges vnséemely that time, are intempe∣ratly passed by them, as though a doting libertie, gotten by some colloure of long experience, and imitation of lighte men, might more warrant their safetie, then a wilde Ape, deceiued by the hunters: with whome whilest they woulde séeme to be that which they are not, they pittifullye forgo ye which they be: making that in which there is no vice, the shade of their ill doing, and with little children (being de∣maunded the cause of their action) answer it is for nothing. To which notwithstanding, there is no enimie so capi∣tall, as these dotards, and light estate of louers: who neuer liked Homer, or his muses, accompanied with nothing: ac∣cording to the ground of their poet: with Muses though thou comst accompanied Homer, if thou bring nothing, ibis Ho∣mere foras: yet haue many of them therefore vowed them∣selues to the suspected holynes of Paulina, who more fauored Mundus, in the person of Anubus for nothing, then in the habit of a Romaine knight, with his xx, Miriadas.
It mattereth not that Cleopatra was more chargeable to hir Corporalls: so that the rest of that sect, who by their sober conuersations, & mildnes of nature, are to alay the bitter accedents of mans lyfe, were excluded these actions: for that their loosenes, is the looking glasse of mans sinne, and (ac∣cording to this rule, that who striketh with the sword, shal be stroke with the scabarde) a pronounced rewarde of their husbands error. Miserable is that course, and contrary to the nature of ho∣nesty, to ascribe to nothing their disloyal parts: but so doe they, that vnder their owne teste, they may be conuinced of many faultes, and their condemnation be greater. Some others there be, by a marueilous indisposition of honestie, (who although they be garded with mo felicities, then diuers ages before them haue tasted) & courted we ma∣ny fauours of hir Maiesty, floate notwithstanding ouer the landmarke of due obedience, for no other cause, if they were well examinied, then for nothing: a matter not agre∣ing with their impietie, which yearely renueth wt Aphrica, some monster, nursed in their mutinus conferences, where being impatient of any season, they woulde drawe the go∣uernments of Princes, to the ordinary rule of themselues, capitulating their fauorers, with special noats of good wil: and cancelling the good names of the rest, with infamous titles: as though that men, and not God, had the erecting of kingdoms: which whilest they frame in the aire, with the rebellious Ciclops, they vndermine their naturall dwel∣lings, and countrye walles: thinking to be made no smale fooles, in that they be, by those meanes knowne to Italie, France, and Spaine: when kings, whose secpters be suppor∣ted with prudence, and iustice, neuer reckned the executio∣ners of their furye, within the Colledge of good men, or thought the reward of such mastiues, any other then gar∣bage. A portion to good for that course, which is made misera∣ble,
in being suspected to them, from whom they looke for al fauor and good wil: a matter to be reserued by great estates, for honest men, least their own people (by an ill president) be drawne from the dutie of good subiects, and recompence their Princes error with disobedience: the same hapning by the iust iudgements of god, which hetherto neuer failed, to minister them, who haue made themselues stumbling blocks to their neighboures, new matter with which they haue béene fearefully intangled, to the terrible example of the whole worlde. Let them therfore deale vprightly with al men, that iudge the earth, and not abuse the amitie of vertuous Princes, for ouerthrowing a good cause: or alienat themselues, or peace∣able ordinaunces from their willing subiects, to the hazard of their whole interests: as though their desires were to sée the order in nature troubled, and to be the last whose eyes should behold the ruin of all things. It were a romth for some idle bodye, so looke into the ac∣cedents of euery state, which hath béen diuersly afflicted for nothing: or to péepe into euery dwelling, for examining this cause, which fathereth many nouelties, and such enter∣prises, as are either bloodily executed, or performed against the vse of common sence: as though those things were law∣full to wise and valiant men, which are not permitted ide∣ots, or thought naturall for brute beasts. In this lowest degrée of reason, Xerxes the greatest prince, and least wise of his time, by an vnspeakeable folly, acqui∣ted all other of extreame blockishnes: for whatsoeuer any dedicated to that Lady or dame he seruilly loued, applied this forgetfull king to a plane trée, putting theron his Di∣adem, yéelding humbly therto his scepter, & complaining with such iestures, as be eyther dissembled by wise louers, or plainely vsed by simple fooles: accursing that day, and night, in which neither Sun or Moone, spread on him the shadowe of his beloued boughes, which had in such sort be∣reaued
him of iudgement, by gathering in the swéete ayre, by their softe mouing, that his care of the Persian gouer∣mente lay vnder foote, more estéeming the compasse of earth, which inclosed the roote of their trunck, thē his seue∣rall gouerments, and large dominions: which in his con∣ceipte were no otherwise beautified, then by giuing nur∣rishment to the same. Of like passions, may large volumes be written, though worthy of no other pen, then a black coale: or memorie then was by decrée of all Asia, left for the burner of Dianas tem∣ple. And although nothing is absolutly simple, innocent, & harmlesse in it self, yet therfore hath all impiety been set a∣broch, duties abrogated, vertue suppressed, truth put to si∣lence, & charitie purst, which should be currant amongest men: by which peruersiō, nothing hath found no lesse fauor▪ then the ritch stone by luster of his foile, or as the faire mis∣tresse, by the company of browning hir mayde. It shall be necessary in respecte thereof, to obserue a lyke proportion, in disciphering ye incomodities of those things we estéeme profitable, to that ende, we may more apparant∣ly perceiue the good effects which come of nothing, as of the least, or no enimie of life, by whose societie many euils depart, which as murderers of peace, either drawe vs from the fauour of God, or bring vs into the vncertaine liking of the worlde: in which there was neuer any, but that he was continually foste and made seasicke, or suffered ex∣treame wracke of lyfe, or other fortunes. And although the opinion which we conceiue of this trashe, hath a like do∣minion in vs, as white or blacke in other coullors: we neuerthelesse gaze theron, we no other admiration & dan∣ger, then Narcissus beheld his beautifull reflexion, or chea∣rishe it then as the frozen serpent, in the warme bosome of the ideot: by meane wherof, we render many times a sor∣rowfull testimonie of our light choise, and dangerous af∣fections. The knot of this mistery hath closed the best wits,
for giuing iudgement, in this repugnancie in nature, vz: y• whilst euery one desireth a long and peaceable time, he yet hunteth after the vse of those things, which frowardly a∣bridge ye good course of life. It is therfore no maruel, though this supernaturall motiue, hath béene condemned of them, who estéeming al things by their weight & fashion, haue for their purpose, this croked saying. Somewhat hath some sa∣uor, not weighing consideratly, y• as by those instrumēts by which we perceiue any pleasure common to man, we per∣take also a thousand incomodities, which flocke without number to crosse the ioyes of life: which so withereth wyth any sorrow, as though we had dwelt in continuall calami∣tie, and neuer felte other then the passions of extreame mi∣sery. Compaire the ioyes and sorrowes, which grow of cor∣ruptable things, & there wil be sufficient reason minstred, to confirme this argument. For beginning with the state of mariage, from whence the maides of Greece reckned their age: who are they, that after the death of their beautifull, & chaste wiues: or contrary wise of their ritch and louing hus∣bands, that thinke not their time past vanished, the present perished, and their life following desolate? reckning the re∣membrance of their olde ioyes, the mother of their newe sorrowes, and lamentable state. Or what naturall parent, being depriued of good children, doth not more lament their losse, then he reioyced of their liues? which being carefully feared, were by so much the lesse pleasant to him, who now sorroweth them with manye teares, as hauing lost the Image of his youth, the lantren of his sight, & staffe of his olde age. Touching the powers of man (whose corrupt na∣ture, windeth as a hop wier, as well about wéedes, as hearbs) they stand vs in so smale stead, that when we haue most néede of them, we are to séeke their help. For whylest one of them empeacheth the others function, the outwarde sences wanting by that meane a moderator, take one thing for an other: obseruing no order in quantitie or qualitie, but
filling all things with iarrs, verifie the saying of the Pro∣phet: by hearing you shall heare, and not vnderstand, and seeing you shall sée, and not perceiue. If these two sences which haue a preheminence aboue the rest (as well for the necessary vse of life, as that by their means, we taste of the louing goodnes of God) be by the deuine Oracle vnprofita∣ble for vs: what is to be said of the other partes of our body which make vs by diuers insolences iniurius to God, and man? but that we haue in each of them many deformities, as though the losenes of our life, were appointed the foile of vertue, or that honesty could not be expressed without hir contrary. The charitable looking vpon the torne leaues and poore afflicted members of Christ, greatly profiteth no doubt the dulnes of our bodily sight: which being séene and not relieued, argueth vs of incrudelitie towards the head, whose parts they are. Furthermore to behold in our sensu∣ality, and not in the singlenes of the eye, the beautiful pro∣portion of the world, the wonderfull, and vnchangeable course of the heauenly bodyes, the marueilous motions of those huge heape of waters in the Sea, and dayly renuing of his other creatures, which preach to vs the infinit wis∣dome and power of God, in the composition of this mighty frame, be likewise testimonies of our darknes, and grosse ignoraunce. For better explayning this matter, in which with full consent the world hath willingly erred: let vs, although there is not any thing so agreable to nature, as the society of euery liuing thing in his kind, yet view the consequent effects of that felowship, and we shal for the most part find it so hurtfull to our selues, that in respect of our mutual en∣mity, we are (by our owne censures) iudged Wolues one to another. For whether it be for the desire of dominion, or to haue comendation for wit, strength, or comlines before others, seldome is there peace: and when it hapneth, it ra∣ther gaineth vs opportunity to breake into greater violen∣ces,
then to set the good slips of vertue: which if we plant, they prosper as growing out of their naturall soyle. It is not therfore to be marueiled, if we regarde all circumstan∣ces, thoughe the other creatures of God be enimies to vs: when our powers and natural parts discent amongst them selues, & one man with great hatred prosecuteth an other. For after the chain of our obedience (by which we were tyed to the fauour of God) was broken, all his other crea∣tures grew weary of our Empier, & as our profest enimies opposed themselues, in the quarell of their creator against vs: either vtterly refusing our company, as that which is supposed dāgerous, or so rebelliously obeying, as they séem our Maisters, vnto whom we ow our seruice, for prouiding their foode, and other necessaries: for which they (being desi∣rous to shake off the yoak of their bondage) yéelde no other recompence, then the stripe of horne, héele, or tooth: vnlesse by our tirranie, they be made the vnwilling seruitors of our appetits. For some resolucion of this matter, let vs be∣holde the naturall contradiction of the simple shéepe, who by a secret instinct, rather chooseth to go naked, by clothing the bryers with hir wooll, and to venture hir sielie body in company of hir rauening enimies, then hir natural owner should be posessed of either. Furthermore, there is not any liuing thing, being not ioyned to our fellowship by some necessitie, whether it be the smale vncleane Flie, or the hurtful and laborsome Cmot, that willingly draweth to y• ame, but to anoye vs: or those things of which we make our profit, conspiring with great mallice against our liues and comodities, for which they lye in waite, as for a praye due to them, for our transgressing the sacred ordinances of God: by whose decrée, not only they, but the elements also haue broken that amitie they had at the beginning wyth man: anoying our bodies inwardly by their vneuen pro∣portion, and no way fayling to oppresse our weake estate, by their outward effects.
For setting aside how the water ouerfloweth our cattle, perisheth our fruits, & drowneth our bodies, may we behold a malice greater then belongeth to lawfull enimies, in casting them vp to be deuoured of Foules and beasts, who are made honorable sepulchers to our miserable carcases: & not yet satisfied with this triumphe of vs (whom she find∣deth beyond al hope, receiued of these common aduersaries) procéedeth with no lesse fury (by mean of the other elemēts) against the remnant of them which perished by hir former crueltie, in yéelding fulsome vapors, which being drawne by some qualitie of the fire, are willingly receiued of the aire, to be suckt of them, who therby are made parents of mortal diseases, and long infirmities. Nether haue we any peace with the earth, a dayly and sullen enemie to man, which eyther by hir quaking, in bearing the heauie burden of our vncleannes, murdereth many: or being mindful how hir beauty faded in the deluge, for our iniquity, so opposeth hir selfe against our labors, that in gathering one ounce of things necessary, we bring in therwith two pound of sor∣row, powdring our meate with sighes, mingling our drink with teares, and slumbering in déepe care, as hauing ma∣ny calamities more attendant then our shadowes, which forsake not our payned bodies, til they haue deliuered them for a full satisfaction, to this gréedy creditor the earth. The ordinary of Tantulus were rather to be wished, then those things or their effects, which by a populer opinion, are named profitable: and therof durst I make some natiue of Platoes den, the Palemon: to whome, although Epicure had shewed the beautifull buildings of Corinth, the swéete perfumes of Thebes, the plentiful tables of Capua, or mag∣nificence of the Romaine Empire, would iudge them farre vnméete for the safe conuersation of man: who with this fraught, may as easily ariue in the heauenly port, as a Ca∣mell may passe the eie of a Néedle. It is worthy of some ob∣seruation to behold the enmitie which the other creatures
besides man, as well sencible as insencible, haue betwéene their seuerall kinds, as the Serpents & Fire, being things sencible and insencible, Oyle and Cowcumbers, feathers of Doues and Eagles, being both insencible, the smale bird Egitus and the Asse, being both sencible, &c. especiallye for that there is no hope left to gather profit by the vse of these things, which are so incomodious to themselues. It seemeth Byas, or as it pleaseth some Stilpo, disagréed not from this argumēt, who in flying naked the town of his byrth, which conteined both his friends & substance, y• were at one instāt in hazard of burning: answered them, who willed him more carefully to regard his losse. Al those things which be mine I take with me: inferring therby, that vertue is the onlye ornament and possession of a wise man: all other things being but snarles to intangle honestie, and to cast vs head-long inso much miserie. Of that opinion were many other, who beholding our states buffeted by prosperous or aduerse Fortune, vtterly condemned the life of man, as y• which by the vse of world∣ly things was made the storehouse of many euils. The consideration hereof, ministred Heraclitus large floodes of teares, and clowdes of sighes, as vnfained wit∣nesses of his continuall mourning, for those miseries wyth which he beheld our liues filled and made lamentable. The selfe same caused Democritus to laugh at them, and their madnes, that thought all other times then those, in which they pursued the causes of their short life, or infinite trouble, lost. They both agréeing, that our liues be so delu∣ded wyth the world, as the vnwarye bird, by the Fowlers call, or the gréedy Trowt, by the sundry coulors of the fethe∣red hooke. In all these matters may we behold the true portraits of sorrow, layde forth wyth the deceiuable coulors of Anagi∣rus, were we not such, which by custome, lyke as well the reflexions of light, as the natural brightnes of the Sun: or
as children ill learned to forgoe with Esau for Porrage, a land that floweth with heauenly foode. And although we deserue no better (if we respect our own worthynes) then a surplus of those euils: yet for that they may be seperated by an other trade of life, I condemn them as meanes, to drawe vs from pietie, or by which we are in∣ferior to brute beasts, who are farre from those affections, with which we be burdened and throwne downe. I may appeale in these matters, from common opinion, to the Citezens of the worlde, whose experience knoweth we be no otherwise made of, then of Sirenes, or pittied, then of Crocodils: but each way assailed with flatteries, and sup∣posed compassions, as a people il guided to discern of our ad∣uersaries. This duely considered that all things be either naturally our enimies, or by our error in vsing them, made vnprofitable: let vs as men made wise by our owne perril, make much of their contrarie, by whose benifite we fynde some inclination to honesty, or by whose meane, we lose not our liues, credite, and peaceable state: but may haue in respect of our securitie therby, one countenance with Iuue∣nals passenger: when others hauing their harts heauier then their pursses, cursse with the wearie Spainard, the ti∣tles of Crosses, they being turning markes of high wayes, farre from the dwelling of men: honoring on the other side the wheele, and gibbet, as signes of rest, being placed neare to Townes, and Citties. The affinitie which hath béene euer betweene nothing, and the pouerty of men, maketh the one hardly to be discer∣ned from the other in the possession of their owners: the ef∣fectes of both, being the cause of good arts, and inuention of some newe matter profitable to the world. For the mind being at no time idle, or as some will haue it, neyther al∣wayes wel occupied, & not impeached with forrein causes, traueileth to bring forth somwhat of excellent quality, and therefore haue I marueiled at the idlenes of those times
which had leasure to establishe this saying. Pouertie is an enimie to good manners, a prouerbe amongst vs: the same being necessary for the knowledge of our selues, that are by the contrary most insolent and intollerable. Dionisius whilst he had the pompe of a King, was estéemed of all men tirranius, & being expelled his realme, named for his tem∣perance, and wisedome, a Phylosopher. Alexander of Ma∣cedonia, being (for his dominions) wounded wyth the holy flatteries of Iupiter Hamons Preists, of a sober Prince be∣came violent: as he terriblye expressed in the miserable fortune of his faythfull counceller Clitus, and the lamenta∣ble state of Persepolis: by which & such like he brought him∣self in hatred of his people, by whose seruice he passed ma∣ny hazards of battle, which then were had in admiration, & nowe scarce beléeued of those, that haue not traueiled in the diuine Oracles of Daniell, and other wrighters (touch∣ing that matter) of good report. For such were the disagree∣ments of affections in this Prince, that whilst he estéemed the contents of the worlde, he excéeded all the great men of his time in losenes of lyfe, and extreame crueltie: and con∣trarie wise, when he feared nothing, and reuerenced the louers therof, as he confirmed by visiting Diogenes in hys Tun: there was none gained so easily the harts of all men as he: being by their whole consents iudged worthy, for his magnimitie and temperance, vnto whom the world ought only to yéeld his obedience. Notwithstanding this opinion receiued by all men of him, repaired he (as I saide) to the straight lodging of Diogenes, as vnto him with whom he had neare equalitie in nothing. The which this good Phylosopher had in such estimation, y• he offered therfore dayly supplications, to those Images which were erected in the publicke places of Athens, for ye memorie of their good Citizens: although some hold, he ob∣serued this custome to that ende he might more paciently beare the deniall of such necessaries, as he sought at the
handes of ritch men. But how vnprobable their opinion is, the conference betweene him being in his Tun, and Alexander standing betweene the sun and the mouth therof proueth. For after Alexander found that confirmed by his owne experience, which he heard reported by others, touching the excellency of Diogenes wit, and the rare quicknes of his spirite: and seeing him with a minde greater then belongeth to a man in aduersitie, to contemne both life, and other matters of the world, he studied according to ye worthines of himselfe, to nurrishe those vertues by somewhat, that might be agre∣able to the magnificence of a King: and therfore encorraged Diogenes (whom he found not stored with any thing in his Tun, which serued for all weathers) to aske possession, or other necessaries. But Diogenes who resolutely adicted him selfe to that dwelling, which he preferred before the Areo∣page, and Courts of Kings: and vnto whom the least mat∣ter in the fauour of nothing séemed gréeuous: required A∣lexander in lieu of his offer, to remoue his shadow, that had entred the mouth of his Tub, as that wherewith his lod∣ging was ouer charged, ye same being only reserued for him and nothing. Esope who painted to vs by Byrdes, Fishes, Serpents, & foure footed beasts, the forme of an honest and safe lyfe, be∣ing taken with the enimie, and made subiect (with fooles) to misery, was wt other bondmē offered to be sold to Xantus the Phylosopher, and being demaunded by Xantus what he could do, to that end he might therafter rate his price, chan∣ged not with his fortune his opinion: but answered, as if he were rather to be estéemed of the byer, he coulde do no∣thing. Xantus who became maister to this Esope, and knew the treasurers of nothing, to be the paimaisters of Phylosophie: to make triall with what iudgement, his newe seruaunt affirmed himselfe able for nothing, and desirous as well to
sée a louer, as a doer therof: had brought to his house by hys comandement, and the conduction of Esope, one that loued nothing: whom Xantus enterteined with great fare, and for a Phylosophicall conclusion, and want of other melodie, to furnishe that feast, counterfeited the inuention of Pitha∣goras musicke on his wiues backe: who singing a sorrow∣full plaine song therto, ministred such cause of mirth to his gueste, that he fel from the boorde with extreame laughter: by which Xantus knew the great iudgement of his man, in finding the owner of this Iewell, whom he caused to be so∣lemnly cōueied out of his house vpon four mens shoulders, as that which was not worthy to lodge so honorable a per∣son: an act answerable to the high renown of this learned Phylosopher. Socrates who by the Oracle of Apollo, was named the profoundest man of that time: out of whose springs Plato dranke the swéete licor of his Phylosophie: who though he might wt warrantise, in respect of that praise, haue challen∣ged the first place for his vniuersall knowledge: yet he e∣steming the same as a matter contemptible, made his choise to knowe nothing only: as by which he found the way to vertue more safe, and with lesse danger. This purpose he chaunged not at that time he went to dye for inueighing a∣gainst the Athenians adoration of Idols. For euen then, when Xantippa his wife, the same Xantippa (who not long before as a good Scholemistresse to learne him the suffe∣rance of aduersitie, had powred a vessell of colde water on his head) saw hir temperat companion (who had long bene the packehorse of hir housholde actions) taken from hir by his Idolatrus Citizens, pittifully lamented (as being per∣haps pleasd, to be otherwise honestly rid of his Philosophi∣call rules) that he should suffer for nothing. But Socrates, who at no time was vnlike himselfe, gladly confessed to dy willingly for nothing, for whose sake he had named him selfe ignoraunt of all things: and therfore blamed hir, that
rashly misliked the cause, by which he was made innocent of any crime, that might slaunder his life to the world. Caius Caesar, being of that magnanimitie, that the world difficultly conteyned his greatnes, to sound the disposition of the Senat, preferred diuers sutes to them for himselfe, & fauorers: but they as men iealius of the Romaine state, and muffeled with the ouer sight of their fatall destinie, graunted (not knowing what) nothing: a matter taken of Caesar in better part, then if they had made him perpetuall Dictator: as by which being no way their debter, he tooke occasion to enter vpon them, and their liberties, and conse∣quently to cease the large domains of their Empire into his hands: wheras if they had in the beginning alaide the heate of his ambition, with the ordinarie hope of other su∣fers, he had giuen place to some other, who had chastised their gormandise, that brought them in hatred of all men. The opinion which these great Princes, and excellente Phylosophers conceiued of nothing, might confirme o∣thers of meaner iudgement to be on their side: if either y• good euents which haue risen therof, or the authoritie of the wit, or valure of those rare men, were of force with the people: who we smale labor are made attentiue to behold Iuglers, and to creadite their craft, as a matter of no more deceite, then the teares of light women. But in as much as these prophane presidents, are not of sufficient weight, to draw those who dissembling the loue of nothing, snatch with Esops Dogge at the shadow of their bone: let vs behold what methode of teaching yt contempt of transitorie things (and the loue of their contrary) was vsed of our heauenly Doctor, who what rule soever he laid downe to be followed of his people, he first practised (as a good lawmaker) in himselfe: refusing (naturall order being peruerted) the managing of temporall things, as ill furni∣ture for the policie of yt kingdome. He framed his Saints: who being more beloued of God then the Lillie or young
Rauen: (the one beautified and the other nurrished, with∣out any helpe of the world, or nature) are to exspect greater succour in their infirmities, & stronger aide. How vnpro∣fitable mouldes the world and nature are to cast the forme of a godly perfection, he hath drawne with quicke coullors in the person of the ritch man, who is not by ye sacred rule made perfite, vnlesse he sell all that he hath, and giueth the same to them that haue nothing. Great is the excellencie therof, whose owners be the ob∣iects of charity, which (to cloath hir naked children) seeketh not those things which be hir owne: and no lesse expedient for our righteousnes, which is made perfit by possessing the same: an act to be regarded for our payment, which neyther the robber taketh, or is made corruptible by the rust, or moth. When contrariwise to entertaine them that tast the fat of the earth, is without hope of rewarde: vnlesse the casters of water into the Sea, are to be praised for their charitie. Amongst other passages which may be cited for this purpose, leauing the ordinances of Moyses, which re∣iected such as were solicited with worldly busines, as per∣sons vtterly vnprofitable for warlike discipline: the same being a tipe of the life of man, named no other then a Pil∣grimage, or warfare vpon earth. Christs louing imbrace∣ments of the little children (who cared for nothing) are not of least importance: for their simplicitie being the shadow of our fyrst innocency, is to be reentred, as the posterne of true godlynes: which lieth not open to them that haue the world in admiration, and be not resolute follows of the childrens ignorance. As the good scholler of this most excellent Maister the A∣postle, desired not to know any thing in Corinth, but Christ crucified: as if he would haue said, setting that most highe misterie aside, by which only without any adiunct, or sepe∣rated cause, the heauens lye open to vs, the rest are to be refused, as impeaching true godlines. What is there to be
gathered hereof? but y• nothing furthereth our deuotions, and therfore to be made of, before matters of the worlde, as the same Apostle, not as I make him speake, but as he fur∣ther proueth, by adding that the worldely or fleshly man, perceiueth not those things which be of God: then which ignorance, there is not any thing anexed vnto the misera∣ble and wretched estate of man of worse qualitie, the same being the bend sinister, which deuideth our parts from the inheritance of Gods children: who are not reputed his, vnlesse they shake off the loue of the world, & themselues, and boast of nothing, as without which, they pertake many things with vnreasonable creatures, whose natures by vse they put on, and are made lyke them in all things, their shapes excepted. For in that sence also spake the Apostle, when he layde before the Corinthians some course of lyfe, which he would they vsed, as though it were not: which argument, the beloued Disciple followed, wyth no lesse emphasis, then the chosen vessell of God: forbiding the loue of the world, the same being pregnant in it selfe, to seques∣ter from our vse all societie of the heauenly traine: which is to one purpose, as if he had extolled nothing: whose praises he might haue more expresly set downe, but that he endeuored to bring the same in fauor, by dispraise of the contrary: as Licurgas comended to his Cittizens sobrietie, by shewing them the vncleane behauiour of his drunken bondmen. This kinde of teaching hath béene vsed of diuers, when without iolence they entended to remoue an euill deepely rooted in our affections: which are not in weeding their vn∣naturall superfluities, to be pressed wyth the seuere disci∣pline of ruffe censures: least they being made weake by that meane, let slip the good séedes of vertue, wyth the cor∣nels of our corruption, as bodyes losing their retentiue fa∣cultie, by vehemencie of the purge. But to returne where I left, touching the contempt and
abiect vse of worldly things, Petrarck in his tryumphe of death, newly speaking in our tongue, by an vnlearned trā∣slator, mainteyneth the same argument. THe Popes (saith he) the Kings, & who cōmanded haue the worlde, Are naked now, misers, and needy persons all, Now treasures where? now honors where? and precious stones? And Scepters where? & Crownes, Myters, & purple shewes? He wretched is that layes his hope in mortall things. But who doth not? and if he finde himselfe at length Deceiued, tis reason great, and answeareth well his act. O senceles men, so much to traueile what auailes? To the auncient Mother great all shall returne at last, And hardly shall the mention of your names be found. Of a thousand labors not one a profite yeeldes, But each of them apparant vanities are knowne. Your studies who doth vnderstand can tell me this. With mindes inflamde, alwayes to domage of your selues, What profite ist? so many countryes to subdue, And nations diuers tributaries make vnknown, And after enterprices perillous and vaine, With blood to conquer walled Townes, and treasure get? A way more sweete is found with water, and with bread. With glasse & wood, then with ritch orient stone & gold. By these hurtfull effects & dangerous impressions of all things, I finde great cause why nothing should be more re∣garded: as wel for that it serueth al humors, though by sun∣dry meanes, as that also the same is enimie, or hauing soci∣etie with things hurtfull to man: but a good helpe, to make him in true godlines like pacient Iob (so much commended of God) who more then yt rest of men, stood beholding therto, as vnto his vnseperable friend, which only accompanied him into the world, remayned with him in his miserable pouerty, and sicknes, and lastly returned with him, to his
Sepulcher, the gate of his rest and felicitie, in which al∣though no man hath in this world a perfection, yet draweth he nerest therto, either in the prime of life, or decreped age therof. The first as was said of yong children not caring for the world, and therfore happy: the other being vnfit for the world, and therfore like to be happy. For in the latter time of man, when all things remaine vnpleasant to him, not for that he hateth them, but in respect of his want of power (which then wareth weake) to vse them, he maketh of hys necessity a vertue, and in lieu of his wonted violences, and ouer running the world, either restraineth himself to some monastical life, or teacheth at home the vse of true fortitude and militarie prudence: or if weakened by the dangerous assaults of loue, he highly praiseth chastitie, reading to hys wife the legend of good women, wherby she may more pai∣ently haue fellowship with him in his inuoluntarie absti∣nence: or if in his yong time he alwayes labored in the fields of Neptimus, he wareth being olde a maker of Carts for Nauigation, meaning to recompence the furious cruel∣tie of his youth, with the charitable compassion of his olde age: it is for the sequal a matter of no smale consideration: to beholde these particions, and first the infancy, which ha∣uing little or no comunitie with worldly felicities, resteth pacified with the abiect things of nature, the other being of many parts (by some participation it hath wt two faced Ianus) a neuter to all things. The contempt, or societie of the world, that hapneth by this necessitie, is no way worthy of praise in vs, though (as Vbi desinit Philosophus incipit medicus) it be an externall meane, where by we supernaturallye apprehende, the heauenly graces, that haue no societye with those things, for which we enuie, mislike, or imbrace one another: or for which we teare the bowels of the earth, or trust our selues to the vnconstant waues, or ruffe seas. From these dangers of life, if any (by the deuine proui∣dence)
escape, they are beyonde all expectation (when no o∣ther thing is lefte them then a weary confusion) mightily succored by that diuine power, which til then, lyeth aloofe, as a strong reliefe for our weake estate. To this are the testimonies of the scriptures answerable: which witnes the bountious liberality of God, to the needy, naked, miserable, and possessors of nothing, and his indig∣nation to the mighty, and rich, whom he pulleth from their seates, and sendeth emptie from his presence. Furthermore, where as the schole men haue this ground, that Natura abhorret vacuum, which is the natural element, or residence of nothing, it consequently followeth, that she also abhorreth nothing, which maketh nothing, by so much of greater dignity, by how much our nature being peruerse is prone to sinne, the only cause of Gods fearefull iudge∣ments, and heauie displeasures. These are the effects of nature (an enimie to the Courte of nothing) to kindle on our backs, hir bundle of rotten sticks, with the consuming fire of Gods wrath. I cease not in respect hereof to muse at them before mētioned, that com∣plaine for nothing, (as Procis being ielous of Aura) the same remaining a harmles companion of our life, by whose fellowship, we may say with Cicero, that we be neuer lesse alone, then when we be alone: and by our experience af∣firme, that we are not any way so safe, as when nothing is neere vs: which hauing all the parts of trust, on which we may confidently repose our selues, is to be prefered before any thing in nature: whether it be man (who for his seue∣rall perfections is named the little worlde) with whome diuers vnresonable creatures, to abate his swelling hu∣mours, are equally matched in many things he claimeth prerogatiue: or any other liuing creature, which for some perticuler qualitie, is noted to be excellent aboue the rest. For if we looke into the reasonable substance of man, & ap composition of his body, nothing is more absolute in euery
part then he: if into the courage of the Lyon, or force and docilitie of the Elephant, nothing doth apeare of more for∣titude, strength, and aptnes then either: and againe if we regard fidelitie, méeknes, and prudence of the Dog, Dooue, and Serpent: nothing goeth beyond them in their seuerall properties, being both inlarged & restrained beyond any substance that is definit: of whose favor, there is no sort may more boast, then the reuerent estate of the maryed: for that nothing maketh their attonments, renueth their leagues, & setteth order in their housholde busines, ministring in all seasons such argumente of peace: that thy stately Capitall (prowd Rome) had not beheld y• bloody fal of pacified Caesar, if nothing had accompanied him: neither had Ierusalem béene infortunat in the losse of hir beautifull Temple, and mighty walles, if nothing in place of hir seditious Cap∣tains had taken hir defence, against the terible siege of that good Emperour Titus. And yet had the France, O honorable Shatilion, beheld thy white haires and valiant bands, if no∣thing had councelled thy King to cōmend the execution of his displeasurs to the fearfull night: in which Nocte sub ob∣scura, heu flebile Martis opus. Neither had thy prouinces poore Belgia, being the sweete harborough of many nations, suffered so many violences by the incursions of the Italian, and Spanishe Armies, had their leaders loued nothing, as they did the sweetnes of the soyle, their rich Cities, and beautifull buildings: steynd by their forces with thy peo∣ples bloode, and filled with impietie, minstring to thee, in steade of thy countrey lawes, a Souldiers libertie, and vn∣to thy neighbours new motions, wherby they might more opportunely, attend the execution of their policie: which kindleth the fire of thy vayne, in the howels of thy people: who being distracted by their diuers zeales, take armes to expell themselues, and to fill al parts wyth the newes of their fall. For it accordeth with equitie, that in what we offend, we be chastised.
Thy medicine for this greefe is the vnitie of thy people, which if (by thy fatall destinie) it be impeached, learne to submit thy stiffe neck and mightie shoulders, to that yoak vnder which prowd nations haue drawne. I forget not how vnpleasant this later councell séemeth to them, who haue with so much blood mainteyned their li∣berties: yet would I haue them estéeme that sweete, which gaineth their safety, ye either is by the two former means obteyned, or purchased by alteration of times, or surely es∣tablished by nothing. Let vs in consideration of these con∣tents, in like sort estéeme nothing, as those mighty Cham∣pions, & wise men, who blushed not to be vanquished there∣with, either in matter of courage, or wit: for as nothing maistred them in their professions: so wrought it effectu∣all meanes for their preferment, honoring famous Cap∣taines for fighting their countrey battles: enritching vali∣ant Souldiers, who made their bodyes the Bulwarkes of the people: reuerencing ye lerned Iudge for doing of iudge∣ment and iustice: and peaceablie chearishing the godly ler∣ned, for redifteng the house of God. Furthermore, from this haue many attained to the highest dignities in common Weales, as Alpheus, who of a Taylor, was created Con∣sull of Rome: as also Velocissimus the Horse of the Empe∣rour Comodus had been, if his maister had not been preuen∣ted by death Moreouer this is it, which being matched in ballance, with those things the world accounteth most ex∣cellent, mounteth toward Heauen, as to his naturall Cen∣ter, the rest discending, as earthly, contemptible, and vile. It seemeth for the sequell of wonderfull price, when the profest and common enimie to man (who more then tyme deuoureth all things) vpon couenant for some seruice to an olde woman, to haue hir or nothing (as for the excellencie, impossible to be deliuered) had notwithstanding, his vn∣satiable greedines satisfied, out of a bottomlesse pitcher, which (this good mother) had hong for that paiment, behind
hir dore. To conclude, I thinke no lesse perrill to be in handling temporall things, then in pulling vp the wonderfull roote Baaras: one order being prescribde for our health in both: which consisteth in touching either, as matters which be vile and of great danger: and therefore am perswaded that this later age, cannot but acknowledge sundry benifites which rise of nothing, as that which nurseth the godly in the loue of vertue: and punisheth the transgressors of good lawes: without the execution of which two, I doubt how the beam of iustice will stand vpright, & giue gold weight, what visor of well doing soeuer is put on to deceiue the world: which being not improperly painted, to be held in the hand of God, taketh not further hurte then is due for sinne, and limited by his diuine prouidence. I feare I haue béene offensiue to many, for tarying so long on nothing: who therfore should not (if they duely regarde their particuler) remaine seuerecensors of this matter: they hauing either feared, loued, or estéemed nothing, with grea∣ter partiallitie then I haue addicted my selfe to this labor. The rest which are delighted in the study hereof, I refer to the macheronicall phantasies of Merlinus Cocaius, and sléepie Phantasmata of Francois Rabilois, men greatly traue∣led in this busines: which being so wel handled of thē both, I thought vnnecessary to touch any further at this tyme: mistrusting not, but many wil hereafter with their whole affections finishe the same: of which as the excellent sub∣stance of the heauens and earth were at the first created: so shall they within few reuolutions of yeares returne, as vnto their first matter: from ye time forth shal iniquitye be vnhorsed, that now ouerruneth the godly with many tira∣nies, and then shall the good people of God tryumph wyth the Lambe for euer. FINIS.
