By the Quene. THe Quenes Maiestie vnderstanding that there be cer∣taine persons, hauing in times past the office of Ministery in the church, which nowe do purpose to vse their former office in Prea∣ching and Ministery, and partly haue attempted the same, assem∣bling specially in the City of London in sondry places, great nom∣ber of people, wheruppon riseth amonges the common sort not on∣ly vnfrutefull dispute in matters of religion, but also contention and occasion to breake common quiet: Hath therfore according to thauthoritie committed to her highnes, for the quiet gouernaunce of al maner her subiectes, thought it necessary to charge & commaund, like as hereby her highnes doth charge and cōmaund, all maner of her Subiectes, aswel those that be called to ministery in the churche, as al others: that they do forbeare to prea∣che or teache, or to gyue audience to any maner of doctrine or preachyng, other then to the Go∣spels and Epistels, commonly called the Gospell and Epistel of the daye, and to the Ten com∣maundementes in the vulgar toung, without exposition or addition of any maner sence or mea∣ning to be applied or added, or to vse any other maner of publique Praier, Rite or Ceremonie in the churche: but that whiche is alredy vsed and by lawe receaued, or the common Letany vsed at this present in her Maiesties owne Chapell, and the Lordes praier, and the Crede in English, vntill consultation may be had by Parliament, by her Maiestie and her three estates of this Realme, for the better conciliation and accorde, of suche causes as at this present are moued in maters and ceremonies of Religion. THE true aduauncement wherof to the due honour of almighty God, the increace of vertue and godlynes with vniuersall charitie and concord amonges her people, her Maiestie mooste desyreth and meaneth effectually by all maner of meanes possible, to procure and to restore to this her Realme. VVherunto, as her Maiestie instantly requireth all her good faithfull and louing subiectes to be assenting and ayding with due obedience: So, if any shall disobediently vse them selfes to the breache herof, her Maiestie both must and will see the same duely punyshed, both for the qualite of thoffence, and for example to all others neglecting her Maiesties so reasonable commaundement. Yeuen at her highnes palais of Westminster, the .xxvij. day of December, the first yeare of her Maiesties reigne. God saue the Quene. ¶Imprynted at London by Rychard Iugge, Printer to the Quenes Maiestie. Cum priuilegio ad imprimendum solum.
