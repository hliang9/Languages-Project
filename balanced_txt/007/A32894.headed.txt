Christian Unity EXHORTED TO: BEING A few Words in tender love to all Professing of Christianity in Old England, the Land of my Nativity. WHEREIN The difference between Profession and Possession of that which is really the substance of True Religi∣on, is clearly manifested. ALSO, The great Breach of Christian Charity, caused by their furious Contentions about Formality. With a few words to the Poor in Spirit, concerning my Opi∣nion of a saving knowledge of Christ Jesus. By one who dearly loves all those whose Conversation becomes Christ's Gospel. Ephes. 4. Ver. 1.2, 3. I therefore the prisoner of the Lord be∣seech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called, with all lowliness and meekness, with long-suffering, forbearing one another in love, endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. Printed in the Year 1678.
Moderate Reader, 'TIS my hearts desire that all might come to know the difference between the Form and the Power of Godliness, which is the only Foundation of true Religion; not that I do in the least imagine that all are in igno∣rance, but because I have observed that the generality of Christians are chiefly contending about the form; and the greatest animosity, that I ever heard or read of, have been caused by their different Opinions in that matter: There∣fore, according to the knowledge the Lord hath been pleased to bestow upon me, 'tis my Judg∣ment, that if the Power of Godliness were more exalted, and the Form less regarded, our love towards God and our Neighbor would be more augmented. Reader, I doubt not but some have written largely on the same subject (however new fashions and new Books are most pleasing to the curious pallates of these times;) but I have found more of Controversie than true Pie∣ty in many of them; for 'tis most certain that Logick translated into Divinity, hath set all Christendom on fire. And he that can frame Syllogisms in the vindication of his Opinion, is reputed the best Christian, although he be but a
cold well disciplin'd. Thus hath true Religion imongst Christians (so called) been almost (if not altogether) eztinguished, Christian fellow∣ship confounded, and Charity (which no true Christian can want) buried in oblivion: Thus have they by their implacable contests about the Form, disputed themselves out of the true knowledge of the Power of Godliness: witness the sensuality, earthly mindedness, and luke∣warmness that most Professors are possessed with. Friendly Reader, 'tis not my desire to ex∣asperate the minds of any; for moderation is that which I chiefly aim at; therefore I pray be impartial in judging what thou readest, and when thy mind is retired, thou wilt find a li∣ving sense in thy self of the truth of what is written: then may we praise and magnifie the name of our God, to whom Glory; Honour, Praise, and Obedience is due, now and for ever. July 13th. 1678.
Christian Ʋnity, &c. WHen I consider'd the diversity of opinions amongst nominal Christians, I could not but consult the cause, which being found, the effect was not strange; for the Devil hath been that Jesuit which hath sown the feed of Division amongst men in former and latter Ages; and where the Notion of a Diety is not totally extinguished, the Creature is a framing to it self some∣thing that may have the form of Divine worship, wherein perhaps may be perceived some seeming satisfaction which Induceth many to make a large profession of it, but the Soul not being satisfied with shadows, puts them on seeking some∣thing else that may be more fatisfactory; so after many years Travel in the wilderness, they return empty, lamenting their lost time, spent in that which profiteth not; the sence of which causeth them to enter into a serious contemplation, at which time the still voice of the spiritual Shepherd (Jesus Christ) whispers to the Soul, if thou art thirsty I will give thee of the water of life freely, after which thou shalt never thirst, for it shall be in thee a Well of water springing up to everlasting life, so all the faculties of the Soul shall be refresh∣ed with Heavenly food, for he is the Heavenly bread which alone can satisfie the hungry Soul; he is the true living sub∣stance most to be desired; all outward elementary substances can but gratifie the sensual part of man; but such hath been the deplorable state of many Nations, since the great Apostacy from that pure Spiritual worship so much exhorted to by Christ and his Disciples, that the Lord hath suffered a Cloud of darkness to over-spread the understandings of the children of men, so that they have been a long time grovel∣ing in the dark among the earthly Elements, pleasing them∣selves with the Pictures of Divine worship, making such
great professions of the form, they deny the power of God∣liness and have destroyed thousands of each other, because their Emblems of Divine worship did not agree in likeness; how contradictory this is to a serious, humble, self-deny∣ing, meek Spirit, let the sober Reader judge. Oh therefore 'tis the desire of my Soul, that every one that professeth the name of Christ should walk worthy of him: Eph. 2.3. endeavouring with all lowliness, meekness, long suffering, and forbearing one another, in love to keep the Unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace; therefore way a with all striving and contending about matters that are only circum∣stantiall, forbear imposing that on each other which cannot freely be received by either, exclaim not against each other, because your Opinions do not agree in all particulars; but labour more and more after Unity rather then Uniformity; let all Controversie be ended, since it lies not in your power to bring each others mind into one mould, desire earnestly of the Lord to mould them into one. Ah dear Friends how helpful would you then be to each other in exalting the glory of God, and ready would the Lord of life be to water you with his blessings, that you may encrease more and more with love to each other; and this certainly will de∣stroy the design of the great Enemy of our Souls Salvation; whose design hath been chiefly to cause Dissentions amongst us: Oh that our moderation might be known to all men, that Christian Fellowship may be renewed, and our confe∣rence with one another more Heavenly, that vain Disputa∣tions may be prevented; Oh let us rather declare to each other what the Lord hath done for our Souls; how he hath filled us with spiritual joyes. How! sweet are the streams of Divine love: How! exceedingly pleasant is the Sun∣shine of his countenance, how are all the faculties of our Souls ravished with his Beauty, Oh then may not we de∣clare these things to worldly men that their affections may be more Heaven-ward. Dear Friends, these are not hearsays cull'd out of Books of mens inventions, but they are the precious fruits of Gods holy Spirit; or as Paul said, the tasting of the Heavenly Gift, which is a living power from
whence all our Spiritual comforts arise; the knowledge whereof is one of the chiefest principles which constitutes a true Christian. Friendly Reader, these are the rich possessions of a Chri∣stian, this indeed is the very substance of Religion; there∣fore I say, that man that enjoyes the substance may be a Christian without the form, but no man with the form can be a Christian without the substance. Moderate Reader, notwithstanding I have contemned the formes of Religion, I do not condemn all persons pro∣fessing any of the several forms; for there are some who have much of Gods power accompanying them in their ex∣ternal performances, but no longer then the power of the mind and all the faculties of the Soul are joyned with them; my Opinion is of that latitude which extends to all who desire to have a saving knowledge of Jesus Christ; notwithstanding I cannot but reprove those who content themselves with a bare Historical faith, and indeed 'tis to be feared that there are too too many have no other evi∣dence for their Christianity, then a verball repetition of their Creed, commonly called a confession of Faith; how far is this from that which purifies the heart, and obtains such victory over sin, even to the removing of Mountains of corruptions; let any sober Christian judge: but Christs own Testimony sufficeth; for he saith, he that believeth in him, out of his belly shall flow Rivers of living waters; therefore it manifestly appears, that, that faith which pro∣duceth not these effects, is not the true faith. A few words to the poor in spirit, who have been weary∣ed in Travelling on the barren Mountains, and do now earnestly desire to know the true way. It being my own condition in times past, I cannot but sympathize with thee who ever thou art that hast been wandering in by paths, whilst we pretend to know the true way; therefore it manifestly appears that we wanted a true acquaintance with, and a spiritual knowledge of Christ, who declared himself to be the way and the life; Let us but reason together, Was not the knowledge we had of Christ
only Notional? had we any other evidence of faith in him, but a bare ascent to what we have heard and read concerning him? what did it all amount to? what satisfaction had we? only a groundless hope of Salvation, because many others whom we supposed good Christians were of the same faith: we had hopes to be saved by Christs merits, hope after from punishment; but what experience had we of the virtue of Christs redeeming power out of sin here? he came not only to save us from the punishment, but dominion of sin, and to bring in everlasting righteousness. Now if thou art not wedded to thy former profession, and hast a true desire after the saving knowledge Christ Jesus the only Saviour of the world, I shall (according to the measure of knowledge given me of God,) plainly and af∣fectionately declare what I believe to be a saving knowledge of him; also what I have experienced of the benefits flow∣ing from him: first thou must know him to be at the door of thy heart by his invisible and eternal Spirit, at all times according to St. Johns Testimony: Behold I stand at the door and knock, if any one will open to me, I will come into him and sup with him, and he with me. Friendly Reader, how many Days, Weeks, Months, and Years, Reve. 3.20. hath our dear Saviour been knocking at the doors of our hearts, and we have passed it by, thinking't was no∣thing but the checks of a natural conscience: How! often have we vexed, grieved, and pierced, his holy spirit, how! often have we crucified him afresh by rejecting and despi∣sing his Heavenly counsel; how have we turned a deaf ear to all his reproofs; and all was because we had not a true sence of his being so nigh to us, but were a seeking him where he was not to be found. Secondly, thou must know him to be thy Teacher, and reprover: 'tis his spirit and not a natural conscience that checks thee for every evil thought, word, and deed; how often hast thou been made to cry, Lord forgive me, when no person in the world could accuse thee; he it is that in∣structs in all things that pertain to thy everlasting wellfare, for he is always wooing and beseeching thee to turn from
the evil of thy ways, Joh. 1.12. and if thou wilt but hearken to his instruction, thou shalt receive power to overcome all the Enemies temptations, for the wholy Scriptures of Truth testifie, that to as many as receive him he gives power to become the Sons of God. Thirdly, thou must know that he alone works in thee all good acts which thou performest, so thou art but the instru∣ment, and he the workman; therefore all the honour of e∣very good work is due to him, who worketh in us both to will, and to do all things that are pleasing to his Heavenly Father; all therefore that he requires of thee, is to be on a con∣tinual watch, so that thou mayst know when thou art re∣proved; for I testifie in Gods fear so long as thou art on thy spiritual watch thou shalt not think an evil thought, but thou shalt be sensible of his reproof. By this means friendly Reader thou wilt come to be more and more, inwardly ac∣quainted with him whom thou didst formerly know only by hearsay, then wilt thou cry out with Job. I have heard of thee before with the hearing of my ear, but now hath mine eyes seen thee; and the more thou comest acquainted with him, thou shalt experience the virtue of Christs purifying power, whereby thou shalt be more and more cleansed from all thy dross and corruption, and those in whom he works righteousness he will continually justifie, for the blood of Je∣sus Christ will cleanse us from all sin: so that we may be made fit Heirs of that Kingdom, prepared for those that are true believers; now dear friend thou wilt not be in want of outward representation to bring thee in remembrance of Christ Jesus, for the true real spiritual enjoyment of the sub∣stance will cause all shadows to vanish, and beggerly Ele∣ments to melt away, for it is impossible (so long as thou art on thy spiritual watch) to be unmindful of him; otherwise thou mayst take thy lot with the unwatchful Centinel, who (though well armed) is surprised with the Enemy, and taken Captive; this is the condition of many whom I believe to be true Christians, for their being overcome by the enemy, is not because they were false and hypocritical in what they pro∣fessed, but because they were sometimes off their watch, for
Christs Disciples were not all Hypocrites, because they slept when their Lord and Master commanded them to watch; yet I say, that unwatchfulness is reprovable in any, being a great duty exhorted to by Jesus Christ; for he said, what I say un∣to you, I say unto all, watch; and this comprehends all the directions which are conduceably to a holy life. Now my dear friend, I have in short declared unto thee what my opi∣nion is, concerning a saving knowledge of Jesus Christ; it is not my desire that thou shouldest vow Allegiance to my Dictates, or pin thy faith upon my sleeve, as I doubt we have both, oo much formerly upon others; but my heart earns towards thee, that thou mayst be perswaded to hearken to the teachings of Christs spirit alone; and then thou wilt not need any of mans teaching; for the Scriptures of Truth testifie that no man knoweth the things of God save the spi∣rit of God, which spirit is ready and willing to instruct thee in all things that are necessary for thee to know; so this is one great benefit thou shalt partake of by this inward acquain∣tance with Christ, in knowing him to be with thee at all times, and in all places; Nay, when thou art in thy bed, (if thy mind be retired) he will make thee remember what thou hast done in the day past, for he sits in thy conscience judg∣ing all thy actions; note therefore, that conscience is not the Judge, but the Seat wherein the Judges sits, therefore pray mistake not the Seat for the Judge: for I cannot but make mention of this thing, because of the great mistake that thousands are in about this matter; for when they have been afraid to commit some gross sin, they say their conscience will not suffer them; not considering who it is that is in their consciences restraining them from sinning; so Christ hath been robbed of his honour, and many hundreds have been in want of his Divine power, because they have not known him so near them. Friendly Reader, let me intreat thee when thou art in a serious frame of spirit, examine thy own heart, and I doubt not but thou wilt find some sense of these things in thy own particular, and it shall be the desire of my Soul, that the Lord may increase in thee more and more a lively power∣full sence of his Truths, that it may be to his glory, and
the everlasting welfare of thy poor immortal Soul: and for thy farther satisfaction, search the holy Scriptures, for I de∣sire not to write any thing but what they testifie, and wait on the Lord alone for Direction and Counsel; therefore con∣sult not with flesh and bloud, and thou shalt receive an in∣ward sence of that which thou desirest to know; for the seeking that of mans wisdom which alone belongs to the Revelation of Gods spirit, hath been the only cause that many have been always a learning, and yet never come to the knowledge of the Truth; friendly Reader, I doubt not if thou art one who desires to be acquainted with the holy di∣ctates of Christs spirit, but that thou wilt have a clear un∣understanding of the vast difference between thy seeking knowledge from the precepts of men, and the Revelations of Gods spirit; (too too much slighted by many in our Na∣tion) therefore pray let us beware of doing despite to the spirit of Grace? and resisting the Holy Ghost in working on our corrupt wills and affections, in order both to our con∣viction and conversion; for though there is no power in our natural Wills to act that which is good, yet there is an abi∣lity to refuse resisting of that which hath power to work; otherwise how could it be said in Scripture, that men grieve and quench the holy spirit of God, and resist the Holy Ghost, and turn from the grace of God to wantonness, which hath provoked the Lord to declare by his holy Prophets, that his spirit should not always strive with man; which makes me to conclude that there is a Passive, (though not an active) power in mans will; for certainly the Lord would not so much complain on the Children of men for rebelling against his good spirit, if they were not destitute of all power in yielding obedience to its holy operation; how did our dear and ever blessed Saviour Jesus Christ lament the sad state and condition of the City of Jerusalem, when he said, How would I have gathered you as a Hen gathereth her Chickens, under her wings, but you would not? which to me is a plain demonstration that there was a possibility of their re∣ceiving, as well as rejecting the tender offers of Christs love, and doubtless he would not have intreated them, were they
wholly incapable of receiving his kind Intreaties. Oh there; fore Dear friends, our destruction is of our selves, for the Lord said by his Holy Prophet in the days of old, why will you dye O House of Israel? clearly shewing forth that we our selves are the cause of our own destruction; Oh let us consider, what could he have done more for us then he hath done, he hath written his holy Laws in our hearts, which are holy Rules for us to walk by; he hath sent his only begotten Son to be our Mediator and Redeemer, that we may be saved from our sins here, and the punishment due to them hereafter; he it is who is the Captain of our Salvation: but if we will not be his faithful Souldiers, we cannot expect his protection. Oh how great hath his long∣suffering been to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance, and to the knowledge of his blessed Truths. Certainly had not our God been a God full of compassion, slow of anger, and of great kind∣ness, who retaineth not his anger for ever, but in wrath re∣membreth his mercy, because his compassions fail not; we might have long since been destroyed, and been now roaring in endless wo and misery; but blessed and for ever blessed be the name of our God whose mercy endureth for ever, that he hath been pleased to continue unto us a day of visitation; whereby we have been made to cry out, what have I done, Lord, what have I done? How have I rejected the tender visitation of thy love? how have I extinguished the Divine motions of thy holy Spirit? how have I sinned against thy loving kindness which is better then life? and abused all thy mercies? Oh therefore let us beware of letting slip the day of our visitation, being there is an Eternity of felicity depends on our improving so gracious an oppertunity: but such are the base inclinations of our corrupt natures, that we use all our dilligence, and watchfulness, rather to enjoy momentary pleasure, then to make sure our Calling and Election; how little do the generality of men regard that which is the most noble part of men, how earnestly do they pursue their sensual delights, which have anxiety always for a companion. Oh that they would be perswaded and entreated to set a part
some time for a serious contemplation on Eternity, where∣by they may be truly sensible of the sad and dangerous state that hitherto they have lived in; Oh that they would beware of being rocked asleep in the Devils Cradle of carnal secu∣rity, which is a great cause that so many have dis-regarded the knockings of Christs spirit at the door of their hearts; and if at any time they are made sensible of some gross evil which they have acted, immediately they endeavour to stop the mouth of conscience, either by hearkning to the Devils Lullabies, (viz.) Libidian Songs, or playing with his Rattles; otherwise ride abroad in his Chariots of sensual pleasures, in which they are frequently carried to the Gates of death; so the destruction of body and soul is the sad consequence which certainly attends those who are (as it were swallowed up of worldly pleasures. But oh man who ever thou art that hast been hitherto led away by the Enemy of thy immortal soul, who would wil∣lingly make thee his associate in eternal misery, be perswaded and intreated to take especial notice of these following words: first let not the Devil tempt thee to imagine, that 'tis too late to turn from the evil of thy ways, because per∣haps thou hast been an old sinner. Secondly, let not the pro∣pensity of thy corrupt will and affections, to folly and vanity induce thee to think the time too soon. Thirdly, let not the multiplicity of thy sins which thou hast not in times past re∣pented of affright thee; for be assured at whatsoever time thou hearken'st to the still voice of Christs spirit in thy con∣science, which secretly rebukes thee, and tells thee all things that ever thou didst, thou shalt find thy heart sorrowful for sin, and as thou keepest on thy watch, thou shalt be brought more and more into a tender frame of spirit, and thou shalt be enabled to turn from thy sin, perfectly, abhorring those things which formerly thou didst so much delight in, and thou shalt assuredly receive pardon for all thy sins past be they never so many and great, according to the words of Christ Jesus, John 5.24. Verily, verily I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth in him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation: for those sins which Christ
pardons in this life shall never be charged to thy account any more, Ezekiel 18.21, according to the words the Lord spoke to the Prophe Ezekiell: But if the wicked will turn from all the sins he hath committed, and keep all my Statutes, and do that which is lawfull and right, he shall surely live, he shall not dye. All his transgressions which he hath committed, they shall not be men∣tioned unto him. Now therefore thou mayst see what great encouragemet all persons have to turn from their sins; Oh that these things were more seriously consider'd by all that profess Christianity, they would certainly be more diligent in improving those golden opportunities, which the Lord through his infinite love and mercy hath allowed them. Friendly Reader, for thy farther encouragement, if thou wilt but take a walk with me in the withdrawing Room of holy Meditation, thou shalt have a Soul-ravishing prospect into the Garden of Heavenly joy, where thou shalt behold the streames of Grace flowing from the fountain of Divine love; and thou shalt drink freely out of the springs of life, which alone can satisfie the appetite of a thirsty Soul; there∣fore be entreated and perswaded no longer to continue plea∣sing thy self in the dead Pictures of Religion, which hath made thee ignorant of those spiritual enjoyments, which alone belongs to the life and power of Christianity, and for which reason many may be ignorant of what I now write: therefore those that would be of the true Religion, must stand no longer on the barren Mountains of profession, but rather hearken to the voice of the spiritual Shepherd, who will certainly lead them into the pleasant fields amongst the green Pastures, wherein grows the flowers of Heavenly joy, and through which runs the pleasant Rivers of consolation, so that thou mayst with joy draw water out of the well of Salvation, whereby thy soul shall be compleatly refreshed, then shall all her faculties (which have long languished for want of true substance) be revived; then shall she be fully sensible of the difference between her true teacher and leader, and the false guides, who had carryed her into the wilderness, where she had been a long time afflicted with trouble and sorrow; then will her bowels be filled with pity and com∣passion,
on all those who did formerly accompany her in her distressed condition, and will be grieved that any should be so deceived as not to be perswaded to hearken to the same spi∣ritual voice, whereby they may partake of the same substan∣tial food; but rather choose to feed on the husk of Religion, then to partake with her of those glorious refreshments, which causeth her to be always praising and magnifying the name of the Eternal God, at whose right hand are pleasure for ever more. A few words to those who are totally ignorant of spiritual things. That there are many in the Land of my Nativity who are totally ignorant of spiritual things, I may boldly affirm; but that 'tis in the power of any mortal man to give them a spiri∣tual discerning I utterly deny; Notwithstanding it seems to me very expedient to remove all obstacles out of the way of the ignorant, least their mis-apprehension of words cause a dis-satisfaction to the matter, which otherwise being accom∣pained with a Divine power, might prove beneficial to them; therefore according as the Lord enables me, I shall endeavour to answer with all plainness those objections which are of most weight. First, therefore it may be required, how I understand Christ to be in all men. I answer that according to the common acknowledgement of all Christians, as he is God, his Spirit is Omnipresent, for the Heavens and Earth cannot contain him, and if his ubi∣quity fills the Heavens and all Created beings, then man be∣ing a Creature must in some measure receive of his fulness; but more particularly, as he is the Son of God the only Savi∣our of the World, he is in all men, though at the same time the fulness of the Godhead is in the Heaven of Heavens at the right hand of his Father, for he doth communicate a mea∣sure of his spirit unto all every individual person in order to their instruction or reproof: Joh. 16.7, 8. Nevertheless I tell you, it is expedient for you that I go away; for if I go not a∣way, the comforter will not com: ebut if I depart I will send him unto you, and when he is come, he will remove the World of sin,
of righteousness, and of judgement. Joh. 14.15. But the Com∣forter which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my nam, he shall teach all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said; therefore 'tis evident, that Christ is by his Spirit in every man, reproving and in∣structing them, and bringing all things that he hath former∣ly said to their and our remembrance. But for a farther de∣monstration I shall use this one comparison, As the natural Son in in the firmament doth communicate its light to seve∣ral parts of the world, at one and the same time, though thousands of miles asunder, and yet the body or whole pro∣portion remains entire in the firmament without any dimi∣nution; so doth the glorious Son of righteousness, though sitting in his Kingly Throne, communicates a measure of his own spirit to every-man to profit with all; which spirit is oftentimes in Scripture called the Light of Christ Jesus, which enlighteneth every man that cometh into the world, John 1.4. sometimes the Grace of God which teacheth us to deny un∣godliness and worldly Lusts, and to walk soberly and godly in this present world; this is that which hath been often in the mouths of many, though they did not ('tis to be feared) know what it was; therefore whoever thou art that hast been in ignorance; be it known to thee, that the Grace of God which thou hast had many times in thy mouth, is Christs own spirit, which spirit hath many times restrained thee from committing wickedness, for without, thou couldest not so much as think a good thought much less do a good action; for as Christ tasted death for every man, he hath given this Heavenly gift to every man, that they may be in a possibility of Salvation; so that we are not condemned for want of grace; but because we do not improve his gift of Grace, for he com∣mands us to nothing but what his Grace or Spirit will en∣able us to perform, if we will but watch when it reproves or instructs us. Some will query thus, how I shall know that I have this good Spirit, why may not persons be deceived and be led by the evil Spirit, whilst they imagine they are under the guidance of the good one.
If thou wilt but enter into a serious examination of thy self, thou mayst call to mind some certain times, when thou hast been under some great temptation to commit some wicked action; at which time thou hast had a sence of some∣what in thy mind that caused a great unwillingness in thee to proceed, and perhaps giving way to the temptation, thou wert overcome; after which thou hast had some terrour in thy self; now therefore observe that which caused that un∣willingness to commit the sin, was Gods spirit, and that which inclined thee to the sin was the Devils spirit; so the Tree is known by the fruit; therefore be satisfied at whatsoever time thou dost sind thy self under temptation, the Spirit of Christ Jesus will be always ressisting, if thou wilt yield obedience to it, thou shalt sind power arising in thee to overcome, the tempter and temptation; by this means thou wilt come to be Spiritually acquainted with Christ, and partake of his bene∣fits, so that he will be precious to thee; for thou wilt be more in love with him then possibly thou couldest formerly, and thou wilt certainly know the difference between his spirit and the evil ones; because the one enclines thy heart at all times to good, and resists evil: and the other always enclines to evil and resists good; so thou needst not fear being de∣cieved if thou art watchful over thy own heart. Friendly Reader, these things I write to thee out of pure assection, and tender regard I have to Gods Glory, and the everlasting well∣fare of thy poor immortal Soul; and that thou mayest know the difference between profession and possession; for there are many that profess the name of Christ who are altogether ig∣norant of him; for though Christ is by his spirit in every man, yet every man is not in Christ; that is, every one hath not taken his good spirit for their Guide and Teacher, but have continued rebelling against it, in so much that they have pro∣voked him to take his good spirit from them, and then, not till then, they may be accounted reprobates; for the Lord of life is so merciful that he condemns nont, but those who have abused his long-suffering and forbearance; therefore it behoves every one to beware sinning out the day of Gods visitation, in which the tender offers of his love and mercy ere extended to them. FINIS.
