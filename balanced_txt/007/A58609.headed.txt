A Declaration of the COMMITTEE of the Estates of the Parliament of Scotland, To the Honourable Houses of the PARLIAMENT, and to all their Brethren of England. AFter so long a continuance of the sad calamities that have almost wasted these three Kingdoms, and the uninterrupted endeavours of this Nati∣on to have all the causes of them removed; We cannot possibly expresse with what grief of soul we find them still more likely to be increased than diminished; Neither did any part of our former sufferings more deeply afflict us, then again to be necessitated to Expressions and Actions, that by some will rather be looked upon as Incentives of new troubles, then meanes to quiet and calme the present distempers. Therefore we have thought fit to offer this en∣suing Declaration to the Honourable Houses of Parliament, and to our Brethren of England, for satisfaction of all religious, loyall and honest men; that Heaven and Earth may beare witnesse with us of the necessity of our Engagement and undertakings at this time, and of the candour of our Intentions and Resolutions. After that by the blessing of God upon the endeavours of this Na∣tion and their Armies at home and in England in two severall Ex∣peditions, a happy Peace was setled, Religion and the just Liberties of this Kingdom established, a Parliament called in England, and great progresse made towards the redresse of all grievances, and re∣forming abuses both in Church and State: It pleased the Lord again to call us to new troubles: For the differences betwixt the King and Parliament being increased and heightened into a bloody War, the many Addresses of this Kingdom to His Majesty and the two Houses
for an amicable composure of differences having proved fruitlesse and ineffectuall, and the Parliament reduced to a low condition, This Kingdom was invited to the assistance of their Brethren, large Pro∣fessions by them were made of their desires of unity and uniformity in Religion, of a neerer conjunction with this Kingdom, and the dangers were fully represented to us of a prevailing Party in Eng∣land, different from us in Religion and Church-Government: It was then acknowledged, that the same fate in Religion attended both: And because it was well known, that although unhappy dif∣ferences had arisen betwixt his Majesty & his Subjects of this King∣dom, yet Scotland could never be drawn into any action against His Majesty, or that fidelity and subjection which they owe to Him and his Posterity; large professions were therefore made by the two Houses of their loyalty to their King, whose greatnesse and autho∣rity they professed they never intended to diminish, as may more fully appear in the severall Declarations; Commissioners were sent into this Kingdom, Invitations renewed, a Treaty made, and a Covenant solemnly signed and sworne for Reformation and defence of Reli∣gion, the honour and happinesse of the King, and the peace and safety of the Kingdoms. Thus both Kingdoms were equally and mutually engaged, and in pursuance of the Covenant and Treaty an Army marched into England in the hardest Season; and both Kingdoms in their joynt-Declaration, Jan. 6. 1643/4. obliged themselves and decreed never to lay down Arms, till Truth and Peace by the blessing of God were setled in this Iland upon a firm foundation for the present and future Generations. Although we shall not mention what successe that Army had, what Blood they lost both in Scotland and England, what hardships they endured, and how much this Kingdome was thereby impoverished: yet we cannot but remember, how that by the blessing of God upon the joynt Councels and Forces of both Kingdoms, the two Houses of Parliament were recovered into a condition of making good those Engagements, and with what unity both Kingdoms proceeded towards the attaining of those Ends, un∣till that Party in the Houses, who since have declared themselves Independents (who seemed forward in the engaging of this King∣dom, and at first profest greatest care of our Army) had attained to power, discovered their intentions, and interrupted all these fair be∣ginnings,
They created and fomented jealousies against the Scots, and by their influence on the two Houses cashiered all in England by Sea and Land, how eminent, how faithfull soever, that they could not confide in; And by the successe of their new-modelled Army, for the most part Sectaries, they engrossed all power Military and Civill into their own and their Creatures hands: the Propositions formerly agreed on by both Kingdoms and treated on at Vxbridge, were altered; yet this Kingdom and those imployed by them were content so far to deny themselves and their own interests, as to wave the Propositions most advantagious to Scotland, and for witnessing their desire of Peace, to joyn in those framed by the two Houses, where the Independents had got such a power: And for the greatest testimony of our confidence in the Honourable Houses of Parliament (notwithstanding the many injuries and discouragements received in England from the then and still prevailing party in the English Army and their Abetters, who were grown Anti-Covenanters, and threatned a disappointment of all the Ends of the Covenant) upon the publike faith of the Houses, given to us for the preservation and safety of His Majesties sacred person, and of making joynt ad∣dresses to His Majesty for setling a safe and well-grounded Peace, and free accesse of all imployed by this Kingdom to his Majesty, the Armies of Scotland returned from England, and left the King with the English Commissioners; most of our Army were immediately thereafter disbanded, and no more kept on foot but so many as were necessary for reducing some Scots Rebels, and Irish, Subjects of the Crown of England (whom by the large Treaty England was bound to reduce) We expected that the like course would have been taken for disbanding of the Armies in England, and none kept on foot but such as were necessary for the Garrisons and safety of the Kingdom, (there being then no profest Enemy in Arms) and those to have been such as both Kingdoms might have confided in, for affection to Re∣ligion and Monarchy: whereunto the Honourable Houses of Parli∣ament did effectually apply themselves, as appears by their Decla∣ration of the 28. of May 1647. But the Independent party were as diligent to hinder it; First by contriving and procuring a Petition from the Army against their disbanding, which by the Houses was Voted mutinous, and the Abetters of it enemies to the State, 200000 l. was provided and Commissioners sent down to the Army for dis∣banding
it, and engaging a considerable Supply for Ireland under the Command of Generall-Major Skippon, and Lieut. Generall Massey, 167 Presbyterian Officers engaged for Ireland and gave obedience to the commands of the Parliament: but on a sudden, the Sectaries of that Army drew themselves together, entred into a solemn En∣gagement against the Resolutions of the Parliament, cashiered all the Prerbyterian Officers who had adhered to the Parliament or sub∣scribed for Inland, placed Sectaries in their Charges, erected a su∣preme Councel of Agitators, and then grew indeed into a compleat new Modell: Soon thereafter, a Party out of severall Regiments, (commanded by a Tailor, a Cornet of theirs, one Joyce) violently sei∣zed on the Person of the King, and carried him from his house at Holdenby, against his own will and the Protestation of the Com∣missioners then attending upon him, and against the declared reso∣lutions of both Kingdoms: and though this action was at first dis∣avowed by the GENERALL, yet it appears to have been done by some under-hand Warrant; for the King was kept still within the Army's Quarters, strong Guards placed about him; and when the Houses thought fit to command the Army not to come within thirty miles of London, and to Vote his Majesties comming to Richmond, They by threatning Messages forced the recalling of these Votes, and carried the King along with them to Hatsield and other places at their pleasure. The Houses did then justly think it necessary to look to their own preservation, lest they should be served as his Majesty was: And upon the 11. of June 1647. they appointed a Committee of Safety to meet with the Militia of London, and consider upon the preservation of the Parliament and City, the great work of the Army being to New-model the Parliament as well as they had done Themselves, and to subdue and enslave that great and glorious City: In order whereunto, they first began with a false & frivolous general Charge against divers Members of the Houses, eminent for affection & actions in this Cause, and violently prest their suspension from the House; but upon a full and free debate it was Voted to be against the Law, to suspend any Member upon a generall Charge, without bringing in and proving of particulars. This procedure did not fit the Armies occasions: Therefore by severall threatning Messages, That they would march to Westminster, That they would purge the House, and that they must take extraordinary courses, They
force the Houses to recall their Votes for a Committee of safety, to disband what forces they had drawn together under Presbyterian Officers, they compell the eleven Members to withdraw from their attendance in the House, And the Militia of London at the unani∣mous desire of the Common-Counsel, being then setled in the hands of such persons as the City might most conside in, the Army to perfect their designs upon them, enforces the Houses to a new modell of that Militia. Having thus in their power the Person of His Majestie, and having overawed the Parliament and City they disperse themselves in the severall Counties about London, list and raise daily more forces, and revolves to settle, or rather to alter and subvert Religion and Government after their own will, as is held forth in their Pro∣posalls, which they first presented to His Majestie, and afterwards sent them to the Houses, as that which they would have the ground of Peace: But the City was so enraged at the change of the Mili∣tia, that they came down to Westminster to petition against it, and the Prentices (who had learned from the Army the powerfullest Arguments to perswade) came in multitudes and prest the grant∣ing of the Common-Counsells Petition. Thus on the 26th of July 1647, the Houses again setled the Militia as formerly, many in London entered into an in Engagement, but the Militia of London quieted all Tumults, setled orderly guards, and the next day the House of Commons sate quietly; yet it was resolved by that partie that the two Speakers and the friends of the Army should flie thi∣ther, which they did: The Houses notwithstanding sate, choosed new Speakers, revived the Committee of safety, and put themselves in a posture of defence, and upon the desires of the Commissioners of this Kingdom, they invited His Majestie to come to London with Honour, Freedome and Safety. The Army drew together, refused to own the Parliament, declared against them, printed their own Proposalls, cryed out against a new War, And in the mean time them and their friends that lied to them, being engaged by a writing to live and die together, marched up against the Parliament and City, who seemed to have been in a readinesse to oppose them, untill by the endeavours of some, that were better friends to the Sectaries; then to the Parliament and City, by their many adresses to the Army nd returns, the City was surrendered, and the Sectaries having rought up the Speakers and Members that fled to them, marched
in triumph through London with Laurells in their hats; Sir Thomas Fairfax was made Captain-Generall of all England, Constable of the Tower of London and Commander of all the Garrisons in Eng∣land; he put out an honest faithfull Citizen, and put in a Sectary Livetenant of the Tower, and then they fell afresh upon the pur∣ging of the House (as they called it) Seven Lords were impeached of a new pretended Treason, the eleven Members forced to flie, and after a fourtnights debate, and being often carried in the negative (for a little Liberty yet remained) At last by a threatning Decla∣ration from the Army, and the Sword-mens coming into the House, all Orders past in absence of the old Speakers, were repealed and some of the activest of the Houses, the Lord Major, three honest Al∣dermen and dvers Common-Counsellours of London charged and imprisoned, the Officers of the City altered, and all upon generall accusations for raising a new War; but indeed really for being zealous for the ends of the Covenant and for defence of the Privi∣ledges, yea the being of the Parliament, against the violence and in∣solence of this Shismatick Army. The liberty of the Parliament being thus destroyed by their own Servants, contrary to their many professions, the famous City of London enslaved to Sectaries, and not onely those priviledges taken from them, which by their faithfulnesse to the Parliament, and with the expense of so much Blood and Treasure they had merited, but even their ancient Liberties troaden on, and all things governed at Westminister and London according to order from the Court of War, who also by a raigning spirit of Levelling Democraty, were, or seemed to be over-ruled be the new-supreme Counsell of Agi∣tators, who had been Souldiers and now were turned superlative Commanders: As the labour of the Independant Junto, was to court the people and the souldiery by Declarations and engage∣ments (which they assoon falcified) and even to trade with the Papists (as was informed) so they studied to interest the Kings party, and cajolled some of them to purpose that were most obnoxtious to the Parliament, and excepted in the Propositions: But they soon manifested to the World, what their intentions were to the King, for after they had made use of the detaining of His Majesties Person in their Army, and of pretending for His interests and partie to enable them to subdue the Parliament and City; That
work being over, they first grew severer to His party (except such as they still made very good use of) and then endeavoured by threatening to fright him away from Hampton-Court; The power of the Levellers was much talked of untill His Majestie was sure in the Ile of Wight, and then their Lievetenant-Generall found a means to quiet them: In the Ile of Wight they first made His Majestie Prisoner, without any known authority, and then got the Houses to own and order it, And by the prevalency of the Independant party, Votes were past making another kind of new high Treason, to make any application to the King, to write to him, or receive letters from him (a severity greater then is usuall against malefactors) and for justifying of these votes, a Declaration was published, with many false scandals cast upon his Majesty, and it is even declared they will put no more trust in his Majesty, yea now we are informed, that by horrid treachery and poyson, endeavours are used to take a∣way his life. As that Independent party, hath endeavoured to subvert the begunne Reformation of Religion, to destroy the King and Monar∣chy, and overthrow the Parliament, and persecute honest men, so it hath been their study even since the removall of the Scots Army, to break the happy union betwixt the kingdomes, to lay aside the Co∣venant, disappoint all the ends of it, and violate all treaties betwixt the kingdomes; we shall not need to repeat the jealousies they crea∣ted and fomented against Scotland, and the Scots Commissioners; and our Army, whilst it was there, how they withheld the maintenance from them due by the Treaty, that by free quarters they might grow burthensome and odious to the people, nor need we now to mention any violation of the large Treaty concerning the remainder of mo∣ney due upon the Brotherly assistance, nor of the money due by Trea∣ty for our Army in Ireland, or by the late Treaty upon the march of our Army; nor shall We now insist on the Breach of that Article of the large Treaty, by which the Houses were obliged to pursue, take, and punish the Irish Rebels, Subjects of the Crown of England, who so long infested us: We have already declared what Breaches they have made of the solemn engagements for the King, and when our Commissioners at London demanded whither the votes against all application to his Majesty, did extend to his Subjects of Scotland, to debarre such as are warranted by the Parliament of this kingdome,
or their Committes from free accesse to, or intercourse with his Ma∣jesty, or that he should be hindred from, and so made incapable of any Act of Government, in relation to the Affairs of Scotland? No An∣swer was then nor as yet is returned thereunto, but before that time, not only such as had warrants for accesse to him were debar'd there∣of, notwithstanding of the engagement of the House 27. of January 1647. to the contrary; But even the Earle of Lawderdaill a publick Minister of this kingdom, contrary to that engagement, and to the Law of Nations, was violently removed by a party of the Army from Woburn, where his Majesty then was, and not suffered to have ac∣cesse to him, and though reparation was therein desired by the last Committee of Estates, yet none was given; And although by the 8. Article of the Treaty 1643. It is agreed that no cessation, pacificati∣on, nor agreement for peace whatsoever shall be made by either kingdome, or the Armies of either kingdomes, without the mutuall advice and consent of both kingdomes, which engagement the Hou∣ses of Parliament also repeated in their letter of the 27. of January 1647. to observe that Article after the removall of our Army out of England; yet contrary thereunto the Sectaries and their adherents framed proposals destructive to the ends of the Covenant, which were presented to his Majesty without the advice or consent of the kingdome of Scotland, and having cunningly inserted therein some things more pleasing to his Majesty, then the propositions of both kingdomes were, it was their study to perswade his Majesty in his answer to the Propositions at Hampton Court, to throw himselfe on the proposals, and thereby unsatisfy both his kingdomes, which as soon as the King had done, they themselves laid them aside and used his Majesty as we have before exprest. And whereas the Houses of Parliament, whilst in liberty, made it their work, first to disband the Army, before any applications to be made to his Majesty, the Inde∣pendent Army having the King within the quarters of their Army, and the City reduced, prest vehemently the sending of the Propositi∣ons of both, kingdoms, whilst themselves were fastest trinketing with their Proposals; a short and peremptory day: was set for deli∣very of the Propositions, without the advice or consent of the Commissioners of the kingdome of Scotland then at London; and Instructions given, That if the Scots Commissioners were not there present at that day, the Propositions neverthelesse should be delivered
without them: And as we have great reason to believe, that it was the study of the Sectaries and those that were their Instruments in that Treaty, that His Majesty should not satisfie his Parliaments by his Answer; yet upon that Answer, by the power and prevalencie of that Party, the Houses of Parliament laid aside the Propositions agreed on by both Kingdoms, and have (contrary to the Treaty) framed and presented Propositions and Bills to His Majesty, against which the Commissioners of this Kingdom declared, and thereafter by order according to their Instructions protested against them in the Isle of Wight, as being destructive to Religion, the Crown, and union of the Kingdoms, as may at large be seen in that printed Answer to the new Propositions, which the Parliament here have owned and approved as the sense of this Kingdom, and which we hold as here repeated: The Parliament of this Kingdom taking into their consideration the dangers thus threatning Religion, His Majesties sacred Person and Posterity, yea Monarchy and all Government; how that by the injustice, violence and treachery of the Independents and their ad∣herents in Parliament and Army, the Covenant was laid aside, all the ends of it frustrated, Toleration countenanced and by the new Pro∣positions endeavoured to be setled, His Majesty imprisoned and such height of insolencies committed against him, The priviledges, yea the being of the Parliament being in a manner destroyed, and the foundations of it razed, The famous City of London (to whom this Nation and all that are faithfull in this Cause must needs acknow∣ledge so great obligations) enslaved, its Liberties troden on, and many of the best affected to the Covenant, in Parliament and City, for their fidelity persecuted and driven away, The Treaties with and engage∣ments to this Nation broken, The publike Faith of England, yea al∣most all Laws divine and humane violated, The people of England opprest with Free-Quarter and Taxes, and the union and brotherly correspondence betwixt the Kingdoms much weakened and endea∣voured to be taken away; And being very sensible of the many in∣juries and affronts done to this Nation, their Army, and those im∣ployed by them; weighing also well how fruitlesse all their en∣deavours by way of Treaty and Messages for curing those evils and removing those differences had proven, and how little regard was had to our Commissioners and their endeavours at London of late,
Thought it high time to look to their own preservation, and to put this Kingdom into a posture of Arms. Yet before any further En∣gagement, they resolved to try, if by the Three just and necessary Demands of the 26. of Aprill made to the Houses of Parliament, it were possible in an amicable way to compose those differences and provide for the security of Religion, of His Majesty, and of the peace and union of the Kingdoms: To the which had a satisfactory An∣swer been returned, all the Inconveniencies that may ensue, might have been prevented, which we have still since that time patiently expected. But in stead of security to Religion according to the Covenant against the dangers on all hands; In stead of freeing His Majesty from his base imprisonment, that he may come to some of his houses in or neer London with Honour, Freedom and Safety, where both Kingdoms may make their applications to him for setling Religion and a well-grounded Peace; In stead of disbanding the Army of Sectaries, by whose power and tyrannie all those evils are come upon us, and further threaten us, without taking any notice at all of what upon so just and necessary grounds we demanded, without any reparation given of the many injuries done to this Kingdome and those imployed by them, or any Answer to that demand made by our Commissioners, Whether it was intended that His Majesty should bee debarred from exercising any act of Government in relation to this Kingdom, Or whether Scots men imployed and al∣lowed by Scotland might have free accesse to him: In stead (we say) of all these, we have received three Propositions to be presented to His Majesty, that after His Majesty assent thereto, and to such Acts of Parliament as shall be offered by both Houses for confirmation thereof, then both Houses will treat with his Majesty, (without tel∣ling him or us, where or with what security to either) concerning the future settlement of the Government of the Church, and the settlement of the Militia, and the rest of the Propositions formerly tendered at Hampton-Court; And a desire from the English Com∣missioners residing here, for us to prepare such Propositions as we shall judge fit and necessary for this Kingdom, that they may be sent to His Majesty with all convenient speed: They did also commu∣nicate to us some Votes of the two Houses; and the Committee of E∣states told them, That they could return no Answer, till first they re∣ceived
satisfaction to the Demands of this Kingdom of the 26. of April, And these are as little satisfied, Religion, the King and his Kingdoms as little secured, and the solid grounds of a Religious and good Peace, as little provided for now as formerly. We shall not much insist on the particulars of these three Propositi∣ons: Our Commissioners did on some of them so fully expresse them∣selves, especially that of the Militia, in their late Answer to the Pro∣positions, before they went to the Ile of Wight (which we here hold as repeated) But we cannot conceale, how very unsatisfactory that con∣cerning Religion is; and we are sorry to see other Interests still so care∣fully provided for, and so little security to Religion, which indeed was the main and principall cause of our Engagement in the late warres. In these Propositions we still find the Covenant omitted, one end of it only mentioned by way of Narrative, and the Propositions for Unifor∣mity according to the Covenant, with all the other Propositions of Re∣ligion left to the future Treaty, and all that is now desired, is, That Pres∣byteriall Government be confirmed by Act of Parliament in such man∣ner as both Houses of Parliament have agreed in severall Ordinances of Parliament, That is to say, &c. The Commissioners of the Parliament and Generall Assembly of this Kingdome have severall times exprest their sense of these Ordinances, which we shall not here repeat: But we doubt this new &c. be of a larger extent, and relates to that impi∣ous Toleration setled by both Houses, so contrary to Covenant, so de∣structive to the ends of it, and for ought we know not yet repealed, a∣gainst which this Kingdom hath so fully declared in the forementioned Answer to the new Propositions: for it was then brought in as a part of the Proposition for setling Presbyteriall Government, as the way that both the Houses then agreed to: And seeing the same over-awing power continues, which first brought in that Toleration avowedly, we have reason to apprehend it still remains, but is now covered & rolled up in this new &c. And we have the greater reason to be unsatisfied, that Presbyteriall Government is only demanded for three years, and in the end of the Propositions it is professed, that the Houses will treat with his Majesty concerning the future settlement of the Government of the Church, without relating to the Covenant as a rule of the Government, or the Propositions formerly agreed upon by both Kingdoms, but in such a generall as may overthrow all the Reformation established, and open a door to Hierarchy or Anarchy, to Episcopacie or Independencie,
and to Toleration, All abjured in our solemn Covenant. And seeing no satisfaction is given to the so just & necessary demands of the Parliament of the 26 of April, either for Religion or the Kings Majesty, but that Religion is still in as much hazard as ever, the King still barbarously detained in his base imprisonment, and as we are cre∣dibly informed, daily in hazard of his life by Treachery and Poyson, and that Army of Sectaries (the great cause of all our evills and dangers) still kept up, strengthned, and a great part of it now marched close to our Border: Though this Kingdome shall never be averse from giving and receiving mutuall satisfaction by Treaty; yet we cannot agree to these Propositions, nor joyn with the two Houses in presenting of them to His Majesty, whilst neither King nor Parliament enjoy their liberties. THEREFOR we can no longer, as unconcerned spectators, be witnesses to the losse and ruine of all, which by the oath of God that lies upon us in our solemn League and Covenant, and by many other obligations, we are bound to endeavour to preserve: And the ends being now the same for which we were invited, and in prosecution whereof we lost so much Blood, did undergoe so many hardships, and so much impoveri∣shed our own country, and being engaged by the joynt Declaration of both kingdomes, never to lay down Armes, till Truth and Peace be set∣led in the Iland, upon a firm foundation for the present, and future Ge∣nerations, being also invited thereunto by many of that kingdom joyned in Covenant with us. Our forces are again in England, and in discharge of our duties to God, our Native King, our own country, and our Bre∣thren in England, we have undertaken this so necessary engagement, in prosecution of those just, pious and loyall ends, to which we are so so∣lemnly sworn. And although we have not at all departed from our good old Principles, and that our Demands and Desires are contained in our severall Declarations, Papers, and addresses this time past to the Hou∣ses of Parliament, yet seeing by the malice of our enemies, many false and scandalous aspersions are cast upon us, our Actions and intentions traduced, and jealousies raised in the minds of many good (though too credulous) men both at home annd abroad; for satisfaction of all that are satisfiable, and to witnesse the sincerity of our intentions and resolu∣tions, we shall here repeat our most material desires, and the grounds of our undertakings. 1. We declare before God and all the world, that we are resolved sincerely, really & constantly, to maintain and preserve inviolably with
the hazard of our Lives and Fortunes, and all that is dearest unto us the Reformation of Religion, in Doctrine, Worship, Discipline and Govern∣ment, as it is by the mercy of God, and his Majesties goodnesse establi∣shed by Law amongst us; and never to suffer it by fraud or force to be taken from us, nor yet to endure the bringing in of Episcopacy, the Book of Common Prayer, or any other of these Innovations and Superstitions, thrown out of this Church, (as some have bin so impudent to averre) And also with the same sincerity, reality, and constancy, in our places and callings, to the uttermost of our power faithfully to endeavour the confirming what is already done in the work of Reformation, establish∣ing the Covenant, and attaining all the ends of it in England and Ire∣land, particularly Reformation of Religion and Uniformity according to the Covenant. 2. We doe also declare that we will endeavour the Rescue of his Ma∣jesties Person from his base imprisonment, that he may come with Ho∣nour, Freedome and Safety to some of his own Houses in or near Lon∣don, that the Parliaments of both kingdomes may make their applica∣tions to him for obtaining his Royall Assent to such desires as shal be by them presented to him, for establishing Religion as is above exprest; and setling a well-grounded Peace, that so his Majesty may live in the Splendor and Glory of his Royall Progenitours, as beseemeth his Royall Place and Dignity. That all differences and troubles may end in mutuall confidence and rejoycing, the King may enjoy the comfort of his Royall Consort and children, with other contentments. And We af∣ter so great distractions and long continued sufferings may reap the blissed fruits of Truth and Peace under his Government. For however the late procedure of this kingdome, may have been misunderstood, yet God knowes that we have never admitted of any thoughts to the pre∣judice of our Gracious Soveraign, his Person and Government, to whom we pray that the Lord would grant a long and happy Reign, and that there may not want one of his seed to rule over us rightly, and to sit upon his Throne, while the Sun and the Moon endureth. 3. That the two Houses of Parliament may be restored to their Free∣dome, that all Members who have been faithfull to this Cause, may freely and safely attend their charges; That the Parliament being Ma∣sters of their own Counsels and Results, they may together with the advice and consent of the kingdome of Scotland, conclude in a Treaty with his Majesty, all other things expedient to a thorough setlement.
4. That the City of London, which hath expended so much in Blood and Treasure, may have their former Propositions presented to the King at Oxford and Newcastle, and prest as was formerly intended. 5. That the Army of Sectaries under the command of Th Lord Fair∣fax of Camron be disbanded, and none employed either in relation to the prosecution of the War in Ireland, or the necessary Garrisons and forces, but such as have or shall take the Covenant, and are well affected to Religion and Government, that so the people of England may be ea∣sed of taxes, free quarter, and other great Impositions under which they have so long groaned. 6. And although the interest of Religion, King and Kingdoms, and the setling of a solid Peace, be the cause of this undertaking: yet we do not doubt but due regard will be had to the concernments of Scotland contained in our severall former demands, both in relation to what is due to this Kingdom and their Armies here and in Ireland, as also what is necessary for the better safety, union and Government of the King∣domes. We have now exprest the true grounds and reasons of this En∣gagement, and the Ends we propose to our selves. And we doe ex∣pect that none, who will not declare themselves Enemies to God, the King, the Parliament, and peace of these kingdomes, will oppose us in this so pious and necessary an undertaking: And therefore wee hope all jealousies and misunderstandings wll be laid aside, and that we shall meet with a hearty concurrence, both of all the Subjects of this kingdom and our Brethren of England. And we doe declare, That it shall be our endeavour to protect in their persons and goods, all of the English Nation, who shall joyn in Covenant with us, and for pro∣secution of those Ends: and that we doe no prejudice nor use violence to none (as farre as we are able) but such as oppose us or those Ends a∣bove mentioned. Particularly we shall endeavour, that the Arrears due to all Souldiers who have served the Parliament of England in this Cause (excepting such as have engaged and abetted the Army in their courses, and shall not immediately desert them) may have their ac∣counts audited, part of the Arrears payed, and security for the rest with full indempnity. And because our Army will be necessitated to live upon the Coun∣try, untill a Regular course be taken for their maintenance: Wee doe declare, that it shall be our care, that they carry themselves as soberly,
and be as little burthensome as is possible; and before we return, we shall labour to see the Northern Counties satisfied for what extraordi∣nary burthens they sustain. To conclude, We declare before God and the world, That we re∣solve by Gods assistance in all our proceedings never to break on our parts the union betwixt the kingdomes, nor to encroach upon the Na∣tionall rights of the Subjects of England, or entrench upon their just Liberties: much lesse is it our intention at all to make a Nationall en∣engagement against the Parliament and kingdom of England, but for them, whose freedome, priviledges, and happinesse, shall ever be as dear to us as our own; And our desires being provided for and secured, then immediately our Army shall depart the kingdome of England, and return peaceably home again; whereof we have twice already gi∣ven real testimonies, our intentions being ever the same with our pro∣fessions, resolving still to continue stedfast in the prosecution of them, for the accomplishment whereof we shall be ready to sacrifice both our Lives and Fortunes. ARCH. PRIMEROSE. FINIS.
