THE Welsh-Mens GLORY, OR, The Famous Victories of the Ancient BRITAINS Obtain'd upon St. DAVID's Day. THe Honor, Glory and the Grace Of Valiant Brute's Tryumphant race, Shewing the Reasons, wherefore they Wear Leeks upon St. David's Day. The Valiant Deeds of Britain's bold, I here shall sing in Verse, Direct my Pen, Heroick Muse, While I the same reherse. That to the Britains Noble Fame, I bravely chant it may, The reason why, they do wear LEEKS Upon St. David's Day. I mean not to relate the Deeds Of Warlike Valiant GUY Nor England's Warwick Champion, Saint GEORGE's Chivalry; Nor any other Warriers Fame, Intend I to display, But what the Britains bold, have done Upon St. Davids Day. Cold Winter with his Frosty Face Doth bid you all farewell; And Manly March, hath taken place, A month with you to dwell: Brother to sweet April Showers, And Usher to fair MAY, And in his Hat a LEEK he wears Upon St. David's Day. 'Gainst Britain when the Romans did Their Warlike Ensigns bear, Instead of Plumes, the green top LEEKS Brute's Valiant Race did wear, Who bravely from the Roman Troop, The Conquest bore away Which Badge of Honour still they wear Upon St. Davids Day. And though stout Caesar, with his Force Did strongly invade their Land, The Britains bold, with Foot and Horse His Power did withstand, And when of them, he tribute sought, They did refuse to pay, For which they still do wear a LEEK Upon St. Davids day. The Saxons entered afterwards, And Essex did obtain, And with an Army well prepared, The Kingdom for to Gain; Each Town and City went to wrack VVhere the Saxons bore the sway, At length the Britains drove them back Upon St. David's Day. They being led by that brave Prince, King Arthur called by Name, VVhose Power with his Valiant Knights The Saxons pride did tame. In twelve Battels them did overthrow, As Chronicles doth say, The last of which, the Britains overcame Upon St. David's Day. Next after that the Lances came in, That great nerping Foe, At Winchelsy, They did begin The Land to overthrow; Till Captain Landaff, a BRITAIN true, Did make their Lives decay, And Conquered the Danish Crew, Upon St. David's Day. VVhen Crook-back Richard, wore the Crown As Regent of this Land; No Policy could put him down, Nor his proud Power withstand: Till Henry Richmond, entered Wales, VVhom BRITAINS did obey, And Conquered in Bosworth-Field, Upon St David's Day. The VVarlike Deeds which late have been, By Valiant Welsh-Men shown, Both England, France, and Germany, And other Lands have known; VVhose Honour with Tryumphant Praise, Fames Trumpet doth display, And Blazen still their Noble Acts Upon St. David's Day. Then doth not our St. DAVID's day, VVell Merit to be Fam'd; VVhereon the most Tryumphant Brute's Their mighty Foes have tam'd, And have so well behav'd themselves, That I may boldly say, The like was never yet perform'd Upon St. David's Day. Of James the Spaniard Boast, Saint Denis stands for France; Saint Patrick in the VVestern Coast, The Irish Men advance; George holds the Sword, David the Scales VVhere Justice bears the sway, And England Drinks a Health to Wales Upon St. David's Day. The BRITAINS have been ever true, And dares for to oppose, Both Pagans, Infidels and Jews, And all that are our Foes; And will maintain their Countrys good, VVhich never will decay, Then blessing be on all their Names, That Love Saint David's Day. And to Conclude, my new made Song, I wish with all my Heart, That they may never suffer wrong, That take the Welsh-Mens part; VVho stand up for their Countrys right, As Lawfully they may, And wear the LEEK as their delight Upon St. Davids Day.
