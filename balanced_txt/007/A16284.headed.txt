Cimina qui quandam studio florente peregi Flebilis heu mestos cogor inire modos ALlas I wepyng am constrained to begynne vers of soroufull matere. That whylom in flourisshing studye made delitable ditees / For lo rendyng muses of poetes enditen to me thinges to be writen / And drery vers of wretchidnes weten my face with very teeris / Atte laste no drede ne mighte onercome tho muses that they ne weren felawes and folowden my way / that is to saye. Whan I was exiled / They that weren of my yongthe whilom wele∣ful & gre conforten now sorouful wierdes of me olde man For elde is comen vnwarly vpon me hasted by the harmes that I haue. And sorow hath comaunded his age to be in me. Heeres hore arn shadde ouertymeliche vpon my heed. And the slack skynne trembleth of myn emptid body. Thilke deth of men is weleful that ne cometh not in yeris that be swete / but cometh to wretchis often y cleped. Allas Allas with how deef an ere deth cruell torneth awaye fro wretches. and nayeth for to close wepyng eyen. while for∣tune vnfaithful fauored me with light goodes. the sorow∣ful houre / that is to saye the deth had almoost dreynt myn eed. But now for fortune clowdy hath changed her de∣yuable chere to meward / myne vnpitouse lyf draweth a longe vnagreable dwellinges / O ye my frendes what or werto auaunted ye me to lene welefull / For he that hath llen, stode in no stedfast degre

I sawe standing abouen the heyght of my hede a woman̄ of ful grete reuerence by semblaunte / her eyen brennyng & clere seyng abouen the comune myghte of men with a lifly colour / & with suche vigour & strength that it ne mighte not be empted. Al were it soo that she was ful of grete age. that men ne wolde not trowen. in no maner that she were of our elde / The stature of her was of a doubtus Iugement / for somtyme she constreyned and shonke her self in the com̄une mesure of men / and somty∣me it semed that she touched the heuen with the height of her hede. & whan she heef her hede hygher she {per}ced the self he∣uen / so that the sight of men loking was in ydel / her clothes were maked of right delye thredes & subtil craft of perdu∣rable matiere. The whiche clothes she had wouen with her owne handes as I knewe wel after by her self declaring & shewing to me the beaute. the whiche clothes a drkenes of a orleten & despysed elde had dusked & derked as it is wont to derke by smoked ymages / In the netherest hēme o bordour of these clothes men red ywouen therin a grekish / A that signefieth the lyf acyf / & aboue that letter in the hiest bordour a grekish .C. that signefieth the lyf cōtemplatif. & btwen̄ these two letters ther were seen degrees nobly wrought
in maner of ladders. by whiche degrees men myghte clim∣ben from the netherest lettre to the vpperest / Natheles han∣des of som̄e men hadden kerue that clothe by vyolence or by strengthe. And euerich man of hem hadd borne aweye su∣che pieces as he myghte geten. And forsothe this forsaide woman bare smale bookes in her ighte hand. And in her lift hand she bare a ceptre / And whan she sawe this se poeticall muses approchyng aboute my bedd / And en∣diting wordes to my wepynges / she was a litill amoe∣ued and glowed with cruell eyen. Who quod she hath suffred approchen to this seke man̄ these comyne strom∣pettis / of whiche is the place that men callen Theatre / the whiche onely ne aswagen not his sorowes with remedi∣s. But they wold feden̄ and nourisshe him with swe∣te venym / Forsothe that ben thoo that with thornes and prykkinges of talentes or affections. whiche that bene noo thyng fructuous nor prouffitable. Destroyen̄ the corne plenteous of fruytes of reson. For they holden hertes of men in vsage. but they ne deliuer noo folke fro maladye But if the muses hadde withdrawen̄ fro me with your fla∣teryes ony an vncomyng and vnprouffitable man as ben wonte to fynde comynly among the peple. I wold well suffre the lasse greuously / For why in suche an vnprouffi∣table man / myne ententes were noo thing endamaged / But ye withdrawen̄ fro me this man̄ that hath ben nou∣risshed in my studies or scoles of eliaticis & of Achadem∣cis in grete / But goth now rather away ye mermayden whiche that ben swete til it be at the laste / & suffrith this man̄ to be cured and heled by my muses. that is to saye
by my notefull sciencis. And thus this cmpanye of mu∣ses yblamed casten wrothly th there doowneward to the erth. & shewyng by redenes her shame they passeden sorou∣fully the thresshwold / And I of whom the sight ploūged in teeris was derkid so. that I ne myght not knowe what that woman was of so imperial auctorite / I waxe al abas∣shed and stonyed / and cast my sight downe to the erthe And began styl for tabide what she wolde done afterward Then̄e come she nere & sette her downe vpon the vtterest cor∣ner of my bed / and she beholding my chere that was cast to the erthe. heuy and greuous of wepyng / compleyned with these wordes that I shal seyn the perturbacion of my thoughte Heu {quam} precipiti mersa profundo Mens habet & {pro}pria luce relicta Tendit ad extremas ire tenebras Ter∣renis quoiens flatibus acta Cresit in inmensum nora cura Hic quandā celo liber aperto etc ALlas howe the thoughte of this man dreynt in our∣throwyng depenes dulleth and forletteth his {pro}pre clerenes / myntyng to gone into foreyne derkenesse. as oft as his anoyous besines wexeth withoute mesure.

And why the sterre ri∣seth oute of the rede Eest to fallen in the westren wawes And what attempreth the lusty houres of the first somer season. And hightith & apparailleth the erthe with rosy floures / And who maketh the plenteous Autumpne in ful yeres fleten with heuy grapes / and eke this man was wonte to telle the diuerce causes of nature that were hidde Allas how lightly is empted the light of his thoughte. & his nekke is pressid with heuy cheynes / And berith his chere enclined a doun for the grete weight / & is constrey∣ned to loken̄ on the foule erthe Sed magis medicine inquit tempus est {quam} querele.

These wordes sayd she / And with the lappe of her garnement yplited in a frounce she dried myn eyen that weren ful of the wawes of my wepynges. Tunc  discussa liquerunt nocte tenebre Lumni∣bus{que} prior redit vigor Ut cum precipiti glomeran∣tur sidera choro Nimbosis{que} polus sttit ymbribus Sol latet ac non dum celo vementibus astris etc Thus whan that night was discussed away / derkenes forlete me.

So that I sette myne eyen vpon her and fastned my lokyng / I behelde my noryce philosophie in whos hous I hadd conuer∣sed fro my yougth. and I sayd thus / O thou maistresse of all vertues descended from the souerayne ste / why arte thou comen into this solitary place of myn exile / Arte thu comen for thou arte maad culpable with me of lse bla∣mes. O quod she my norie shuld I forsake the now. and shold I not parten with the by comyne trauayle the charge that thou hast suffrd for enuye of my name. Certes hyt were not leefful ne fitting to philosophie to leten withoute companye the way of him that is Innocent. sholde I then̄e redoubte my blame / & agrise as thaugh ther were befallen a newe thing / For trowest thou that Philosophie bee nowe alder firste assaylled in perils by folke of wicked ma∣nere haue I not striuen with full grete strife in olde tyme byfore the aage of my Plato / ayenst the folehardynesse of folye.

The heritaige of the whiche Socrates / the heritaige is to sayn the doctrine of the whiche Socrates in his opynyon̄ of felicite / that I clpe welefulnes. whan that the peuple of Epycuriens and Stoiciens and many other enforsed them to go rauisshe. euery man for his part that is to seyn That eueriche of hem wold drawen to the defence of his opynyon the wordes of Socrates. They as in partye of their praye to drowen me yg and debating ther ayenst And coruen and renten my clothes that I hadd won∣nen with myne owne handes. And wyth tho clothes that they hadd araced oute of my cloths they wnten awaye. wenyng that I hadde gone th hm euridele. In whiche Epicuriens and Stoicins for as moche as ther semed som̄e traces and steppes of my habte / The folye of we∣nyng the picuriens and Stoiciens my famylis / per∣ueted som̄e thurgh therrour of the wiked multytude of hem / This i to syn r they smd philsphrs. they wren porswed to the th and slayne / So yf thou st not knowen thexising of Anaxagoras ne then poyse∣nyng of Socrates / Ne the tormentes of eo for they we∣ren straungers. yet myghtest thou hue knowen / the se∣nctyens. the Camos / and the Soranos / Of whyche folke the renommee ys neyther euer old ne vnsolemp The whyche men noo thyng ellis ne broughte to the deth But onely for they were enformed of my maners / And semeden moost vnlyke to the sudyes of wicked folke And forthy thou oughtest not to wondren though that I in the byter see be dryuen with tempestes blowyng aboute. In the whyche thys ys my mooste pourpoose.
That is to seyne to displesen wicked men. Of whyche shrewes al be the hoost neuer so grete. it is to despyse. for hit is not gouerned with no leder of reson / But it is ra∣uisshed only by fleting errour folily & lightly. and if they somtyme make an hooste ayenst vs / Assayle vs as stren̄∣ger / Our leder draweth to gedir his richesses into his tour And they ben ententif aboute sarpleris or sachellis vnpro∣fitable for to taken.

Is this the librarye that thou haddest chosen for a right certain siege to the in myn̄ hous / there as thou dispu∣test ofte with me. of the science of thinges / touching dyui∣nite & touching mākinde / was then myn̄ habite suche as hit is now. was my face or chere suche as is now / whan I sought with the secretes of nature / whan thou enformedest my ma∣ners & the reason̄ of al my lyf to thensample of the ordre of leuene. Is not this the guerdon̄ that I referre to the / to whom I haue be obeysan̄te. Certes thou enformedest by the mouth of plato this sentence / that is to seyn̄. that comyn thinges or comynaltees weren blisfull / If they that hadde
studied all fully to wisedom gouerneden thilke thinges Or els if it so befell that the gouernours of comynaltees studieden to gete wysedom / thou saidest eke by the mouth of the saide plato that it was a necessarye cause / wise men̄ to taken & desiren the gouernan̄ce of comyne thinges. for that the gouernements of citees yleft in the handes of felonous tourmentours / cytezeins ne sholden not bringen in pestilēce & distruccion to good folke. And therfore I folowyng thilke auctours desired to put forth in execucion & in acte of comyne administracion thilk thinges that I had lernid of the among my secree restingwhiles / thou & god that put in the thoughtes of wise folk / ben knowing with me. that nothing ne brought me to maistrye or dignite / but the co∣myne studye of all goodnes. And therof cometh it that bytwene wicked folke and me haue ben greuous discordes That ne mighten not be relessed by prayers. for this liber∣te hath the fredom̄e of conscience / that the wrath of more mighty folke hath alwaye ben dispised of me for sauacōn of right. How ofte haue I resisted & withstande that man that hight Coniugast / that made alwey thassautes ayenst the prosper fortunes of poure feble folk. How ofte eke haue I putte of / or caste oute him Trigwille prouost of the kin∣ges howse. bothe of the wroonges that he hadd begonne to doon̄. And eke fully perfourmed / Howe often haue I co∣uered and defended by the auctorite of me putte ayenst parills. That is to seyne / putte myn Auctorite in perill For the wretchid poure folk. that the couetise of straun∣gers vnpunysshed tourmenteden allewaye wyth myseases and greuan̄ces oute of nombre / Neuer man̄ yet drowe

I toke striff ayeenst the Proudste of the pretorie for the comyne prouffite. And the knowyng of hit / I ouercome hit / so that the coempci∣on̄ was not axed ne tooke effecte Paulyne a counseyl∣lour of Rome. the riches of the whiche Paulyne. the hoū∣des of the palays. That is to saye / thofficers wolden̄ haue deuourd by hope and couetise. Yet drowe I oute of the Iowes of hm that gapeden. And for as moche as the payne of thaccusacion̄ aiugged biforne ne shold not soden∣ly henten ne punysshen wrongfully Albyn a counceyllour of Rome. I putte me ayenst the hates and Indignacions of thaccusour Cipryan / Is it not then̄e ynough syn̄ that I haue purchaced grete discordes ayenst my selfe. But I
ought be more assured ayenst other folke / that for the loue of rightwisnes I neuer reserued noo thyng to my self / to hemward of the kynges halle / by whiche I were the more siker. But thurgh thoo same accusours accusing / I am condempned. Of the nombre of whiche accusours one ba∣siliuz that whilome was chaced oute of the kynges serui∣ce. Is nowe compellyd in accusyng of my name. For ne∣de of foreyn moneye / Also Opilion and Gaudencius han accused me. Al bee hit soo that the Iustice regall hadd whilome demed them bothe to goon̄ in to exyle for her tre∣cheryes and frawdes with oute nombre. To whiche Iug∣gement they nolden not obeye / but defended hem by the si∣kernesse of holy howss. That is to seyne / fledden in to seyntewarye / And thenne whan this was apperceyued by the kyng / he commaunded but if they voyded the Cyte of rauenne by certayne daye assgned / that men shold marken hm on the forhede wyth an hoote yren / and chasn hem oute of the towne / Nowe what thing semeth / myghte bee likened to this cruelte. For certes this same daye was receyued the accusing of my name by thilke same accu∣sours / What maye bee sayd hereto. hath my studye and my connyng deserued thus. or ellis the forsayd damp∣nacion of me maad hem rightfull accusours or noo. was not fortune ashamed of this / Certes all hadd not for∣tune ben̄ ashamed that Innocence was accused. yet ought she han had shame of the filth of myn accusours. but axe thou in som̄e of what gylte I am accused / Men seyn̄ that I wold sauen the companye of the Senatours. And de∣sirest thou to heren in what manere I am accused that I
shold han distourbed thaccusour to beren̄ lettres / by whiche he shulde haue made the senatours gilty ayenst the kynges royal mageste / O maistresse what demest thou of this / shal I forsake this blame. that I ne be no shame to the / Certes I haue wold it. that is to saye the sauacion of the senate I ne shal neu lete to wilne it / And that I confesse and am a knowe. but thentente of thaccusour to ben distourbed shal cesse. Shal I clep that a felonye or a synne that I ha∣ue desired the sauacion of the ordre of the senate / And cer∣tes hadd thilke same senate done thurgh her decretes & her Iugementis as though it were a synne & a felonye. that is to wilne the suacion of them. But folye that lyeth al∣wey to him self may not chaūge the merite of thinges / Ne I trowe not by the Iugement of socrates that it were le∣efful to me to hide the sth ne assente to synges / but cer∣tes how so uer hit be of this I put it to gessyn or prisen of the Iugement of the and of wise folk. of whiche thyng all thrdenance and the sth. for as moche as folke that been to comen after our dayes shall knowen it / I haue put hit in scripture and in remembran̄ce / For touchyng the letters falsely made / by whiche letters I am accused to han hpd the fredom̄e of rome / what apperteyneth me to spe∣ken therof. Of whiche letters the fraude hadd ben shewde apertely if I had hadde liberte for to haue vsed and ben at confession of myne accusours / The whiche thing in al nedes hth grete strengthe. For what other fredem maye men hopen. certes I wolde that som̄e other fredome mighte be hoped. I wold then̄e haue answerd by the wordes of a man that hight Camus. for whan he was accused of gay{us}
Cesar germeynes sone. that he was knowyng and con∣sentyng of a coniuracion y made agaynst him / This Ca∣mus ansuerde thus if I had wist it / thou haddest not wist it / In whiche thinge sorow hath not so dulled my witte that I pleyne only that shrewd folke apparaillen felony∣es ayenst vertue. But I wondre gretly how that they may performe thinges that they haue hoped for to doon. fr why ne wil ne shrewdnes that cometh perauenture of our defaute But it is like a monstre and a meruaille how that in the present sight of god may been achieued and performed suche thinges. as euery felenous man hath conceyued in his thought ayenst Innocentes / For whiche thyng one of thy famyliers not vnskilfully axed thus. If god is. whens comen wicked thinges / But al hadde it been leef∣full that felonous folk / that now desiren the blode and the deeth of alle goode men. And eke of the senate han wilned to goon destroyen me whom they haue seyn̄ alwaye bataillen and defenden good men and eke al the senate that had not deserued of the faders / that is to seyn of the senatours that they sholden wille my destruccion. Thou re∣membrest wele as I gesse. that whan I wold doon or seyn ony thing. thou thy self alway present ruledest me. Atte cyte of verone whan that the kyng gredy of comyn̄ slaugh∣ter / caste him to transporten vpon all the ordre of the sena∣te the gilte of his rial mageste. of the whiche gilte that Albyn was accused. with how grete sikernes of perill to me / defended I all the senate. thou wotest well that I say soth. Ne I ne auaunted me neuer in praysing of my self For alway whan ony wight receyueth precious renom̄e
In auaunting of him self or his werkis / he amenuseth the sere of his conscience / but now thou maist wel seen to what ende I am comen. for myn Innocencie I receyue payn of fals felonnye for gwerdon of verey vertue. & what opene confession of felonnye had euer Iugges so ardant in cru∣elte. that is to seyne as myn cusing hath. that either er∣rour of man̄es witte / or els condicion of fortune. that ys vncertayn to al mortal folk ne submitted som of hem. that is to seye that it ne enclined som iuge to han pite or cōpassi∣on / for al though I had ben accused that I wolde ben̄e holy houses & strangle prestes with wicked swerde. or that I had greythed deth to al good men / algates the sentence shuld haue punysshed me p̄sent confessd or conuicte. but nowe I am remoued from the cite of rome almost. v. C. M. paa I am without defence dampned to {pro}scripcion & to deth / for the studies & boūtees that I haue done to the senate / but / o wel ben they worthy of merite / as who seith / nay / ther might yet neuer none of hem be conuicte of suche a blame as myne is. Of whiche trespaas myn accusours sayne ful wele the dignite / for they wolde drkn it with medling of som fe∣lonye. They baren me on honde & sayde that I had polute & defouled my conscience with sacrilege for couetyse of dyg∣nite / And certes thou thy selfe that arte planted in me. chacedest oute of the siege of my corage al couetise of mor∣tall thinge / Ne sacrelege ne had noo leue to haue a place in me before thyn eyen / for thou droppedest euery daye in myn¦cere & in my thought thilke com̄andement of pictagoras. That is to seye men shal seruen to god & not to goddes / Ne it was not conuenient ne none nede to taken helpe of
the foulest spirites / I that thou hast ordeigned and sette in suche excellence. that thou madest me like to god. And ou this the right clene secre chambre of myn hous / that is to seye my wyff. And the company of myn̄ honest frendes. & my wyues fader as wel holy as worthy to be / reuerensed for his dedes / defenden me from al suspeccion of suche bla∣me. But / o. malice / For they that accusen me taken of the philosophie feith of so grete blame / for they trowen that I haue had affinite to malefice or enchantement / bycause that I am replenisshed & fulfilled with thy techinges & enfor∣med of thy maners. & thus it suffrith not only that thy reuerence ne auaile me nought / but if thou of thy frewill rather be blemisshed with myn offencōn / But certes to the harmes that I haue ther betideth yet this encresse of harme. that the gessing & the iugement of moche folk ne loken no¦thing to the desertes of thinges but only to thauenture of fortune. & iuggen that only suche thinges ben pourueyed of god / which that temporal wilfulnes cōmaūdeth Glosa As thus. that if a wight haue {pro}sperite he is a goode man & worthy to haue that {pro}sperite. & who so hath adusite. he is a wicked man / & god hath forsake him / & he is worthy to haue that adusite. This is thoppinion of som folk / and therof cometh that good gessing. first of althing forsaked wretches / certes it greueth me to thinke right now in diu∣ce sentencis that the peple seith of me. & thus moche I seye that the last charge of cōtrario{us} fortune is this / that whan ony blame is leyd vpon a caytif. men wenen that he hath deserued that he suffreth. & I that am put away from good men̄ & despoiled of dignitees. & defowled of my name by
gessing haue suffred tourmentes for my good dedes. Cer∣tes me semeth / that I see the felenous couynes of wicked men haboūden in Ioye and in gladnesse.

And the drye thinges with the moiste. that the fire that is pured ne flee not ouer hye / ne that the heuynes ne drawe

Nunc demonscrandum reor. quo nā hec felicitatis perfectio constituta sit. In quo illud pri∣mum arbitror inquirendum etc For asmoch then̄e as thou hast seen whiche is the four∣me of good / that nys not {per}fyt / & the forme of good whiche that is {per}fyt. now trow I that it were good to shewe in what this {per}feccion of blisfulnes is sett / & in this thing
I trowe that we shall first enquere for to weten yf that ony suche maner good as thilke good as thou haste diffinis∣shed a litill here biforne. That is to seyne souerayn good maye bee founde in the nature of thynges / For that vaynt ymaginacion̄ of thoughte ne deceyue vs not and putt vs oute of the sothfastnes of thilke thing that is submytted to vs. But it maye not be denyed that thilk ne is / and that is righte as a welle of all goodes. For alle thyng that is clepd inparfite is proued inparfite by the amenu∣sing of perfeccion of thing that is parfite / And here of cometh it that in euery thing geeral yf that men seen eny thing that is inparfite. Certes in thilke thing generall there mote be som̄e thing that is parfite / For if so be that perfeccion is done awaye / men maye not thinke ne saye from whens thilke thing is that is cleped inparfite / for the nature ne toke not her begnnyn of thinges amenu∣sed and inparfite / but hit procedeth of thinges. that bene all ooll absolute And dscendth so downe in to th vt∣trs things and in to thinges empty and with oute fruyte / But as I haue shewd a litill here biforne that yf that there be a lisfulnes that be frele & veyne and inpfite thre maye noo man doubte that there nys som̄e blisfulnes that there is sad stedfast & parfite / B. Thys is concluded qd I fermely & sothfastly. P. But considere also qd she in whom this blisfulnes inhabiteth / The com̄une accorde & conceyte of the corage of men proueth & graūteth that god prce of all thinges is good. For so as nothing maye be thoughte better than god. hit maye not bene doubted thenne that b31e that no thyng nys better than he nys good
Certes reason̄ sheweth that god is so good that it proued by veraye force that parfyte good is in him / For if God nys suche he ne maye not been̄ prince of alle thing / for cer∣tes somthing possessing in it self parfyte good sholde bee more worthy than god. And it shuld semen that thilk thing were first and older than god. For we haue shewd ap{per}tely that alle thinges that ben parfyt ben first. or thin∣ges that ben imparfyte. And for thy for as moche as that my resone or my processe ne goo not aweye withoute an ende / we owen̄ to graūten that the souerayne good is right∣full of souerayne parfyte good. And we haue estabilis∣shed that the souerayne good is veray blisfulnesse. thenne mote it nedes bee that veray blisfulnesse is sette in souerain good. B / This take I wel qd I / ne this ne may not be withsayd in noo manere / P. But I praye the quod she See nowe howe thou maist prouen holyly / and withouten corrupcion̄. this that we haue seyd that the souerayn god is full of right surayne good. B. In whiche manere quod I. P. Wenestow ought quod she that the fader of alle thinges haue taken thilke souerayne good ony where oute of him selfe. of whiche souerayne good men proueth that he is full. righte as thou mightest thinken that god that hath blisfulnesse in him selfe / and thilk blisfulnesse that is in him were dyuerce in substan̄ce / For if thou we∣ne that god hath receyued thilke good oute of him selfe Thou mais wene that he that yaf thilke good to God be more worthy than God / But I am beknowe and con∣fesse & that right dignely that god is right worthy aboue al thinges. & if so be that this good be in him by nature
but that is dyuerce from him by wenyng reson syn we spe∣ken of god prynce of alle thinges. feyne who so feyne may Who was he that conioyned these thinges to gyder. and eke atte laste se wel that a thing that is dyuerce fro ony thing that tilke thing nys not that same thing for which it is vnderstnden to bene diuerce. thenne foloweth hit well that thilke thing / that by his nature is dyuerce from souerayne good. that thing is not souerayne good But certes it were a felonous cursednes to thinken that of hym that noo thyng nys more worth. For all waye of alle thynges the name of hem ne maye not bene better than her begynner. For whiche I maye concluden by right veraye reson. that thilke that is begynnyng of alle thin∣gs / thilke same thing is souerayne god in his substan̄ce B. Thu hast sayd rightfully quod I  Philosophia / but we haue graunted quod she that the suerayne good ys blisfulnes. B. That is sthe quod I. . Thenne qd she we moten nedes graunten and conssen that thilke same souerayn good be god. B. Certes quod I I ne may not denye ne withstande the resons purposed. And I see wll that hit foloweth by strengthe of the prmysses. P / lo∣e nowe qd she if this bee proued yet more frmely thus. That there ne mowen not bene two souerayne goodes that ben dyuerce among hem self / For certes the goodes that ben dyuerce among hem self. that one is not tht the other is. Then̄e ne mowen neythr of hem be parfyte / so as eyther of m lacketh to other / but that / that nys not {per}fyte. men may seen aprtly that it nys not souerayne / The thinges then that be soueraynly good ne mowe by no wey be dce
But I haue well concluded that blisfulnesse and God been̄ the souerayne good. for whiche hit mote nedes been that souerayne blisfulnesse is souerayne dignite. B. Noo thing quod I i more sothfaste than this / ne more ferme by reason̄ ne a more worthy thing than god maye not be concluded. Phīa. Vpon these thinges thenne qd she right as these geometriciens whan they haue shewed theire propo∣sicions been wonte to bringen in thinges that they clepen porrismes or declaracions of forsayde thinges / right so wole I yeue the here as a corallarye or a mede of Crowne. For why for as moche as by the getyng of blsfulnesse men been maked blisfull / And blisfulnesse ys dignite / then̄e hit is manifeste and open that by the getyng of digny∣te men been maked blisfull right as by the getyng of Iustice. And by the getyng of sapyence they bee maked wyse / right so nedes by the semblable reason̄ whan they haue goten dyuynyte thy e mad Goddes / Thenne is euery blisfull man̄ a God. But certes by nature there nys but one God. But by the participacion of dyuinyte there ne letteth ne distourbeth noo thing that there ne bee many Goddes / B. This is quod I a fayre thing and a pre∣cious. clepe hit as thou wilt bee hit Corallarie or porrisme or mede of Crowne or declaring / Phīa / Certes quod she no thing nys fayrer than is the thing that by reson shold bee added to these forsayd thinges / B. What thing qd I. Phīa / So quod she as it semeth that blisfulne con∣teyneth many thinges / it were for to weten whether that alle these thinges maken or conioynen as a manere body of blisfulnesse by the dyuersite of parties of membres
or els if ony of all these thinges be suche that it accompli∣ce by him selfe the substan̄ce of blisfulnes. so all these other thinges bene referred and brought to blisfulnes. that is to seye as to the chief of hem. B. I wold qd I that thou madest me clerely to vnderstande what thou seyste & what thou recordest me the forsayd thinges / P / haue I not iug∣ged qd she that blisfulnes is good / B. yes forsoth qd I and that souerayne good. P / Adde thenne qd she thilke good that is made blesfulnes to alle the forsayd thinges For thilke same blisfulnes that is demed to be souerayn suffisan̄ce. thilke self is souerayn power / souerayn reuerēce Souerayne clrens or noblesse and souerayn dlite / what sayste thou thenne of alle these thinges. that is to seye suf∣fisan̄ce. power and these other thinges / bne thy thenne as membres of blisfulnes / or bene they referred & broughte to souerayne good / right as all thinges hat ben bought to the chief of em. B. I vnderstande well quod I what thou purposest to seke. but I desire for to  that thou shewe it to me. P. Take now thus the disrecon of this question qd she / If alle thes thynges qd se weren mem∣bres to felicite / then̄e weren they dyuerce that one from that other / and suche is the nature of partyes or of membres / that dyuerce membres compowne a body / Bocius / Certes quod I. Hit hath well bee shewed here by forne that alle these thynges bene alle one thyng / Philosophia / Thenne bene they noo membres quod she. For ellis hyt shold seme that blesfulnes were coioyned all of one membe allone. But that is a thyng whyche maye not be done Bocius. Thys thyng quod I then̄e is not doubtous
But I abide to herkne the remenan̄t of thy question. P. This is open & clere qd she that al other thinges be refer∣rid and brought to good. For therfore is suffisan̄ce re∣quyred. For hit is demed for to been good / And for thy is power required. For men trowen also. that hyt be good / And this same thyng mowen wee thinken and coniecten / of reuerence. of noblesse / and of delite. Thenne is souerayne good the somme and the cause of alle that ought to be desired. For why thilke thing that withhol∣deth no good in it self / ne semblance of good / it ne may not wel in no maner be desired ne required / and the con∣trarie / For thaugh that thinges by her nature ne been not good. Al gaes if men wenen̄ that they been̄ good / yet ben they desired as thugh they weren̄ verilich good. And thr¦fore it is sayd that men ought to wene by right that boū∣te bee the souerayne fyne and the cause of alle the thinges that been to requiren̄. But certes thilke that is cause for whiche men requyren̄ ony thing / hit semeth that thilk sa∣me thing bee moost desired / As thus. yf that a wighte wolde riden for cause of hele. he ne desireth not so mochell the mouyng to riden as the effecte of his helthe. Nowe thenne syn̄ that alle thinges been̄ required for the grace of good. they ne bee not desired of alle folke more thanne the same good / But wee haue graunted that blisfulnes ys that same thing for whiche that alle these other thyn∣ges been̄ desired. Thenne is hit thus that certes onely blisfulnesse is required and desired. by whiche thyng it sheweth clerely that of good and blisfulnesse is al one and the same substan̄ce. B. I see not quod I wherefore
that men myght discorden̄ in this. Philosophia / And we han shewde that god and veray blisfulnes is al one thing Boece. That is soth qd I. P. Then̄e mowe we conclude sikerly / that the substan̄ce of good is sette in thilke same god & in none other place Nunc omnes pariter venite capti Quos fallax ligat inprobis ctems Terrenas habitans libido mentes Hoc erit vobis requies laborum Hic port{us} placida ma∣nens qete Hoc pateris vnum miseris asilum etc COmeth all to gyder nowe ye that ben ycught and bounde with wickid cheynes by the deceyuable delyte of erthely thinges inhabiting in your thught. hre shalbe the rste of youre laboure. here is the hann sable in quyete psible / This all one is the pn rute to wretches / that is to se that ye that be combed & deceyued with worldly affccions cometh now to this souereyn god that is god That is refute to hem that willen comen to him.

And thilk thing what someuer it be / by whiche that alle thinges ben y maked and led I clepe him god that is a worde that is vsed to alle folke. P. Then̄e sayde she. syn thou felest thus these thinges qd she. I trowe that I haue litel more to doon / that thou mighty of welefulnes hook & sound ne see eftesones thy coūtre / But lete vs loken the thinges that wee haue pourposed here byforne / haue I not nombred & sayd qd she that suffisan̄ce is in blisfulness / And we haue accorded that god is thilke same blsful∣nes. b / yes forsothe qd I / p / & that to gouerne this world qd she ne shal he neuer haue nede of none helpe fro without For els if he had nede of ony helpe. he ne sholde not haue no fl suffisan̄ce. B / yes thus it mote nedes be qd I / P. Then̄e ordeyned he by him self allone alle thinges qd she
B. That maye not be denyed qd I. P. And I haue shewd that god is the same good / B / It remembreth me well qd I / P / Thnne ordeneth he all tigs by thilk good qd she / syn he whiche we han acorded to be good. go∣uerneth alle thinges by him selfe. And he is a keye and a steyre by whiche the edyfice of this worlde is kept stable and withoute crumping. B / I accorde me gretely qd I. And I haue apperceyued a litil hre biforn that thou wolest saye thus / All were it so that it were by a thynne suspecion. P / I trowe well qd she / For as I trowe / thou ledeste nowe mre entensly thyne ee to loken the vereye goodes. But nahles the thing that I shall telle th. yet n sheweth not lasse to loke / B / What is that quod I P / So as men rowe qud she and that rightfully that god goueneth alle things by the kee of his goodnes. And all ths same thinges that I haue tghte the has∣ten hem b naturelle entencion to come to good / there maye noo man̄ doubten that they ne ben gouerned vsntryly / And that the n conuren hem of her owen good wille to her ordeynour / As that they been according & enclinyng to hr gouernour & to her king / B. It mote nedes be soo qd I. for the royame ne shuld not seme blsful if ther were a yok of misdrawingis in diuerce pes ne the sauyng of obedient thinges ne shold not be  thr nothing qd she that kepeth his nature that enforceh him to goone anst god / B. no qd I. P. & if that ony thing enforced him to withstande god. might it auailen at ls yn him tat we haue graūted to be almighty by the right of blisful∣nes. B. crtes qd I al vtterly it ne might not auaile him
P. Then̄e is there nothing qd she that eyther may or wil withstonden to his souerain god / B / I trowe not qd I P. then̄e qd she is thilke the soueraine god that al thinges gouerneth strongly & ordeyneh hem softly. B thenne sayd I thus I delite me qd I. not only in thendes or in the som̄e of the resons that thou hast concluded & {pro}ued / but thilke wordes that thou vsest deliten̄ me moche more. So that atte laste fooles that somtyme rnden grete thinges oughten̄ be ashamed of hem self. that is to syne that wee fooles that reprehenden wickedly the thinges that touchen goddes gouernance / we oughten ben ashamed of our selfe As I that sayde that god refuseth only the werks of men̄ & ne entermeteth not of it. P / thou hst wel herd qd she the fables of the poetes. how the Gean̄tes assaileden heuene with the godes / but forsothe the debonair force of god dis∣posed hem as it was worthy / that is to seyn̄ destroyed the gean̄ts as it was worthy / But wilt thou that we reioy∣nen to geder thilk same resons / for perauēture of suche con∣iunccion maye sterten vp som̄e fayr sparke of sothe. B. do qd I as the liste. Phīa. wenestow qd she that god ne bee almighty. B. noman̄ is in doubte of it certes quod I. P No wight ne doubteth it. if he be in his mynde qd she. but he that is almighty ther nis nothing that he ne may. B That is soth qd I / P / may god do euil qd she. B / Nay forsoth qd I. P. Then̄e is euil nothing qd she / sith that he may done none euil that may done al thinges. b. scornest thou me qd I or els pleyestow or deceyuestow me that hast so won̄en me with thy resons. the ho{us} of dedal{us} so entrelaced that it is vnable to be vnlaced that thou otherwhile entrest

The whiche {pro}ues drawen to hem selfe her feyth and hr accorde eurich f hem of other / P / Thenne sayd she thus / I ne sorne not. ne pley / ne deceyue the. But I haue shewd the ting that ys grettest ouer al thinges by the yefte of gd that we why∣lome payden. For this is the fourme of dyune substan∣ce tht is suche that hit ne slydeth not ito vtterst foreyn thinges. ne receyueth not no stran̄ge tinges in him. But right as Permemdes seyde in greke of thilk dyuine sub∣stan̄ce  He sayd thus that thilke dyuyne substan̄ce tour∣neth the worlde and the moeuable cercle of thinges / whyle thilke dyuyne substan̄ce kepeth hit selfe withouten moe∣uynges / that is to seyne that he moeueth neuer moo / & yet hit moeueth alle other thynges / But natheles yf I haue

THen̄e sayde I thus.

Considere then̄e how grete defaute of po∣wer. & how grete feblesse ther is in wicked felonous folke As who seith the greter thing that is coueyted & the desir not accmplisshd. of the lasse might is e that coueyteth it & may not accomplisshe. & for thy philosophie seith thus by souerain gode. ne shrewes ne requiren not light mdes ne veyn̄ games whiche they ne may not folowen ne holden but they faillen of thilk somme of the height of thinges. that is to sayne souerayn̄ good / ne these wretches ne comen not to tffce of souerayne good. the whiche they enfcen hem only to geten̄ by nightes and by dayes  in getyng of whi∣che good the strength of good folke is l wel ysene. for right as thou mightest demen him mighty of goyng that gooth on his fete till he mighte comen to thilke place. fro the whiche place there ne laye noo weye frther to bee goone / ryghte so muste thou nedes demen̄ hym for right myghty whiche that geteth and ateyneth to the nde of alle thinges whiche that been to desiren̄ by yonde the
whiche ende there nys noo thing to desire. of the whiche po∣wer of good folke. men maye conclude. that we wicked men semen to be bareyne and naked of alle strength. for why forleten they vertues and folowen vices. nys it not for that they ne knowen not the goodes / But what thing is more feble and more caytiue than is the blindnesse of Ignorance or ellis they knowen well whiche thinges they oughten folowe / but lechery and couetise ouerthroweth hem mystorned. And certes so dooth distemperan̄ce to feble men. that mowe not wrastelen ayeyne these vices / Ne knowe they not well that they forleten the good wilfully And tournen̄ hem wilfully to vices / And in this wyse they ne forleten not onely to be mighty. but they forleten all vtterly in any wise for to ben. For they that forlten the com̄une fyne. of alle thinges that bene. they forleten al¦so therwith all for to bene. And peraunture hit shuld semen to som̄e folke that this were a meruaille to seyne. that shrewes whiche that conteynen the more {per}ties of men̄ ne bene not ne han no beyng / but nathles hit is soo. and thus stante this thing for they that be shrewes / I denye not but that they be shrewes. but I denye simplie and playnly that they ne bee not. ne han noo beeyng. for right as thou mightest seyne of the careyne of a man that hyt were a deed man. so graūte I well forsothe that vycious folk ben wicked / but I ne maye not absolutely & simply graūt that they ben. For thilke thing that withholdeth or∣dre and kepith nature / thilke thing is & hath being / But what thing faileth that / that is to seye / he that forleteth na∣turel ordre / he forletith thilk being that is set in his nature
But thou wolt seyn̄ the shrewes mowen̄. certes that ne de∣nye y not / but certes her power ne descendeth not of strength but of feblesse. for they mowen done wickednesse / the whiche they ne myght not. if they mighten dwellen in the fourme and in the doyng of goode peple / and thilk power sheweth euydently that they mowen right nought. for so as I haue gadred & proued a litel here byforn̄. that euil is not / and so as shrewes. may only but shrewdnesse. This conclusion is all clere. that shrewes ne mowen right nought ne han no power / And for as moche as thou vnderstandest whi∣che is the strength of this power of shrewes / I haue diffi∣nisshed a litel here byforne. that nothing is so myghty as souerayne good. B. that is soth qd I / P. Is there ony wight then̄e qd she that weneth that men mowen done all thinges / B. noman̄ qd I. but he be out of his wite / P. But certes shrewes mowen done euil qd she. B. ye wold god qd I that they might done none / P / Thenne qd she so as he tht is ghty to done only good thinges maye done all thinges / And they that ben mighty to done euyll thinges. ne mowen not all thinges. then̄e is it open thing and manifeste that they that mowen done euil ben of lasse power And yet to proue this conclusion / there helpeth me I haue shewed here biforne. that all power is to be nom∣bred among thinges that men oughten to require. and I haue shewed that all thinge that oughten ben desired / be referred to god right as to a maner height of her na∣ure. But for to mowen done euil & felonye ne maye not been referred o God / thenne is not euil of the nombre of thinges that oughten to been desired and required / then̄e
is it open & clere that the power ne the moeuyng of shrewes nys noo power. And of all these thinges it sheweth well that the good folk been certaynly mighty / And the shre∣wes doubtelesse vnmighty / And it is clere and open that thilke sentence of Plato is vereye and sth. that seyth that onely wisemen̄ may done that they desiren. And shre∣wes mowen haunten̄ that hem liketh. but that they desiren That is to seyne to come to souerayne good. they ne han no power to accomplisshe that / For shrewes done what hm luste / whan by tho thinges in whiche they dlten / they we∣nen to atteyne to thilke good that they desiren / but they ne geten ne atteyne not thereto / For vices ne comen not to blisfulnesse Quos vides sedere celsos solii culmine reges.

That is to seyn̄ by vigour and strengthe of witte / For in this matiere men weren wonte to maken questyons of the simplicite of the purueance of god and of the ordre of destyne and of sodeyne happe. and of knowyng of predestinacion dyuyne And of the liberte of frewille / The whiche thinges thou thi selfe apperceyuedest well of what weighte they ben. but for as moche as the knowynges of these thinges is a ma∣ner porcion or medycine to the / al bee hit soo that I haue li∣tell tyme to doon̄ hit / yet neuertheles I wold enforcen me to shewen̄ som̄e what of hit / But al thaugh the norisshin∣ges of dite of musike deliteth the / thou muste suffren and forberen a litell of thilke delite. while that I wene to th resons knytt by ordre. B / As it liketh to the quod I so do Phīa / Tho spacke she right as by another bygynnyng & sayde right thus. The engendryng of all thinges quod she and all the progressions of meouable nature / and al that meoueth in ony maner. taketh his causes / his ordre and his fourmes of the stablenesse of dyuine thought / And thilke dyuine thoughte that is sette and put in the toure That is to seyne. in the heighte of the simplicite of God Stablissheth many maner guises to the thinges that been to doon̄. The whiche maner whan that men loken it in the pure clennesse of the dyuine Intelligence ys cleped pour∣ueyannce. But whan thilke manere ys referred by
men to thinges that hit meoueth or disponeth than of olde men hit was cleped destenye. the whiche thinges if that ony whighte loketh well in his thoughte / the strength of that one and of that other he shall lightly mowe sene. that these two thinges bene dyuerce. For pourueyance ys thilke dyuyne reason / that is establisshed in the souerayn prynce of thinges / the whiche pourueyance disponeth alle thinges. But certes destenye is the disposicion and the ordenaunce cleyng to meouable thinges / by the whiche disposicion the pourueyan̄ce knitteth alle thinges in her or∣dre. For pourueyance enbraseth alle thinges to heepe all thugh they bee dyuerce / and al thaugh they bee Infinite But desteny certayn departeth and ordeyneth alle thyn∣ges singlerly and dyuydeth in meuyng in places. in for∣mes / in tymes as thus. late the vnfolding of temporal or∣denaūce assembled and coned in the loking of the dyui∣ne thought bee cleped purueyance. and thilk same assem∣bling & onyng dyuided and vnfolden late that bee cal∣led destenye. And al be hit soo that these thinges ben dy∣uers yet neuertheles hanged that one of that other. for why the ordre destynale procedeth of the simplicite of purueyan̄ce For right as a wrkman perceyueth in his thoughte the fourme of a thing that e wole make and meoueth the effecte of the wrk / And ledeth that e d loked beforn̄ in his thought simply & presently by corpral ordenan̄ce. ctes right so god in his purueyance disponeth singlerly & sably the thinges that bee to don / but he administreth in maners & in diuers times by desteny thilke same thinges that e hath disponed then̄e whether destenye bee excercised
eyther by som̄e dyuyne spirites seruauntes to the dyuyne puruean̄ce / or els by som soule. or els by al nature seruyng to god / or els by the celestial moeuinges of sterres / or ellis by the vertue of angelles. or els by dyuerce subtilite of de∣uils / or els by ony of hem. or els by hem all / the destinall ordenan̄ce is wouen and accomplisshed. Certes it is open thing that the puruean̄ce is an vnmeouable & simple forme of thinges to done / And the meonable bonde & the tempo∣ral ordenan̄ce of thingis whiche that th dyuine simplicite of purueance hath ordeyned to done that is desteyne / For whiche it is that al thingis that ben put vnder desteyne ben certes subgittes vnto puruean̄ce. to whiche purean̄ce destenye it self is subgiect & vnder / but som̄e thinges been put vnder purueance that surmūten the ordinan̄ce of des∣tine. and tho ben thilke that stably ben fixd nigh to the first godhed they surmoūten the ordre of destynale moua∣blete. For righte as cercles tornen̄ aboute a same centre or aboute a poynte / thilk crcle that is Innerest or most with in / he ioyneth to the simplesse of the myddel / & is as it were a centre or a poynte to that other cercles that tornen aboute him. & thilk that is vtterest compassed by a larger enuiro∣nyng is vnfold by larger spaces / in somoche as it is fer∣therest fro the middelest simplicite of the point. & if ther be ony thing that knitteth & felaushippeth him self to thilk middel point / it is {con}streyned into simplicite. that is to sey into vn∣mouablete. & it cessith to ben shad & to flitte diusly / right so by semblable reson thilk thing that de{per}teth fortherest fro the first thought of god  it is vnfolden & also submitted to gret∣ter bondes of destyne / and in somoch is the thing more free
and lowse fro dignite / as it axeth and holdeth nerre to thilke Centre of thinges. That is to seyne to god. And if the thing cleueth to the stedfastnesse of the thoughte of god and bee withoute meouyng. certes it urmounteth the ncessite of destenye / Then̄e uche comparison as is ski∣ling to vnderstanding and of thing that was engen∣dred to thing that is of tyme to eternite. And of the cer∣cle to the centre right so is the ordre of meouable destyne to to stble simplicite of pourueyance / Thilk ordenance meo∣ueth the heuen and the sterres and attemprith the elemen∣ts to gdre among hem self. and transformeth hem by enrhungeable mutacion. And thilke same ordre ne∣weth aeyne alle thinges growing & falling a downe by semblabe progressions of sedes and of sexus / That is to sn̄ male and female. And thi ilk ordre constreyneth the frun & the dedes of men̄ by a bande of causes not able to bee vnounden. The whiche destynale causes whan they pasn oute fro the begynnynges of vnmeouable pouruey∣āce  moe nedes bee that they ne bee not mutable. A thus. bee the thinges well gouerned if that the simplicite dwellin in the dyuyne thoughte sheweth forth the ordre f cuses vnable to bee owed. And this ordre constrey∣neth by the ropre stablee the meouable tinges or els they shulden fle foly. For whiche hit  that thinges semen confuse and trowblye to vs men̄. For wee ne mowen not considere thilke ordenaunce. Neuertheles the propre ma∣nre of  hing dressing him to god disponeth hem all  For there nys noo thing done for euyll. for thilke thing that is dene by wicked folk nys not done for euil / the
whiche shrewes as I haue shewd ful plenteously seke good But wicked errour mystorneth hem / ne the ordre comyng fro the point of souerain good ne enclineth not fro his by∣gyn̄yng / but thou maist saye what vnrest may ben a wors confusion then̄e that goode men han somtime aduersite and somtime {pro}sperite / & shrewes han now also thinges that they desiren & now thinges that they haten / wheder men lyue now in suche holnesse of thought. As who seith. be men now so wise / that suche folk as they demen to e good folk or shre∣wes. that it mote nedes be that folk be suche as they wenen But in this maner domes of men discorden / that thilke men̄ that som̄e folk demen worthy of mede. other folk deme hem worthy of torment / but ate vs graūte I suppose that som man̄ may wel deme or knowe the goode peple & the bad May he then̄e knowe & see thilk Innerest attem{per}an̄ce of co∣rage as it hath be wont to be seyd of bodies / as who seyth May a man̄ speken̄ of complexions & attemperan̄ce of bo∣dies / ne it ne is not / as who seith but it is lik a meruaile or a miracle to hem that ne knowen it not. whi that swete thinges be couenable to som bodies that ben hole / & to som̄e peple bitter thinges be couenable. & also whi som people ben holpen with light medicines / & som̄e peple ben̄ holpen̄ wyth bittir medicines / but natheles tho that knowen̄ the maner & the actemperan̄ce of hele & of maladie ne meruaileth it noo thing / but what other thing semeth helth of corages but bounte / and what other thing semeth maladie of courai∣ge but vices / Who is els keper of good and driuer awey of euyll / but God the gouernour and lether of though∣es. The whiche God whan he hath beholden̄ from the
high toure of his pouruean̄ce / he knoweth what is couena∣ble to eny wighte / and leneth hem that he wote well that is couenable to hem. lo herof cometh and herof is done this myracle of the ordre destynable / whan god that all knoweth dooth suche thing of whiche thing vnknowyng folk ben̄ astonyed. but for to constreyne as who seith but for to comprehende and telle a fewe thinges of the dyuine dep∣nesse / the whiche that mannys reason maye vnderstande. Thilk man̄ that thou wenest to bene right Iuste & righte kepyng of equite. the contrarye of that semeth to the dy∣uine pouruean̄ce that all wote / Ad lucan my familier tellith that the vyctoriouse cause liked to the goddes / and the causes ouercomen liketh to Caton̄ / Thenne what soo euer thou maiste sene that is done in this world vnhoped or ellis vnknowen̄ / certes hit is the righte ordre of thinges But as to thy wicked opynyon / hit is a confusion / but I suppose that som̄e man̄ be so wele thewed that the dyuyne Iuggement and the Iuggement of mankynde accorden hem to geder of him / but he is so vnstidfaste of courage. that if ony aduersite come to him / he wole forleten perauenture to contynue Innocencie / by the whiche he ne maye not wyth∣holden fortune / then̄e the wise dispensacion̄ of god spareth him the whiche man aduersite might enpeyen. for that god wille not him to trauaille / to whom that trauaile nys not couenable. Another man̄ is parfyte in all vertues and y an holy man and nygh to god so that the pourueance of god wold deme that it were a felonye that he were tow∣ched with ony aduersitees. so that he wole not suffre that suche a man̄ be with ony bodily maladye meoued. But
so as sayde the philosophre / the more excellent is by me sayde in grete that vertues han edefied the body of the holy man / & ofte tyme it betideth that the sōme of thinges that bene to done is taken to gouerne to good flk. for that the malice habondan̄t of shrewes shuld bene abated / and God ye∣ueth and departeth to other folk prosperitees & aduersite∣es medeled to heepe after the qualite of her couraigis / and remordeth som̄e folke by aduersitees. for they ne shuld not waxen prowde by long welefulnesse / and other folk he suf∣freth to bee trauailled with hard thinges for that they shuld confermen the vertues of couraige by the excercitaci∣on of vsage of pacience. And other folke deden more than they oughten the whiche they myghten well beren / & som̄e dispise that they mowe not bere. And thilk folke god le∣deth into experience of hem self by aspre & sorouful thinges And many other folke haue brought honourable renom̄es of this world by the price of glorious deeth. And som̄e men that ne mowe not bene ouercomen by tourment. han ye¦uen ensample to other folke that vertue may not bene ouer∣comen by aduersitees / And of all these thinges there nys noo doubte that they ne bene done rightfully and ordeynly to the parfyte good of hem to whom wee sene these thyn∣ges betyde. For certes that aduersitees cometh somtyme to shrewes / and somtyme that they desiren hit cometh of these forsaid causes & of sorouful thinges that betiden to shrewes Certes noo man ne wondreth / for al men wene that they han deserued hit. and that they ben of wicked merite. of whiche shrewes the tourmente agasteth somtyme other to done felonyes / and somtyme it amendeth hem that suffreth
the tormentes / & the prosperite that is yeuen to shrewes. she∣weth a grete argumēt o goode peple / what thing they shulde demen of thilke welfulnes. which {pro}sperite men seen ofte serue to shrewes / in which thing I trow that god dispēseth For {per}auenture the nature of som man is so outhrowing to euil & so vncouenable that the nedy pouert of his houshold might rather agreue him to done felonies. & to the maladie of him god putteth remedie to yeuen him richesse. & som̄e other man̄ beholdeth his consciēce defouled with syn̄es and maketh com{per}ison of this fortune & of him self / & dredeth {per}auenture that the blisfulnes of whiche the vsage is Ioy∣ful to him. & the lsing of thilk blisfulnes ne be not sorou∣ful to him / & therfore he wolde chaūge his maners. & for he dredeth to lese his fortune he forleteth his wickednesse. to other folkes welfulnesse is euen vnworthily / the whiche ouerthroweth hem into destruccion̄ that they han deserued. & to som other folke is yeuen power to punisshen for that hit shalbe cause of continuacion & ecercising to goode folke & cause of torment to shrewe. for as there ns none allian̄ce btwix goode folk & shrewes. ne shrewes ne mowe not ac∣corden among hem self / And whi not. for that shrewes disorden of hm self by her vices. the whiche vices all to renden her conscience and done oftyme thinges the whiche thinges whan they han done hem / they deme that tho thinges ne shuld not han be done. for which thing the souerain pur∣ueance hath maked oftyme miracle. so that shrewes han maked shrewes to ben goode men / for whan that som shre∣wes seen that they suffre wrongfully felonies of other shre∣wes / they waxen eschaued in to hate of hem that annoyed
hem and retournen to the fruyte of vertue. than they studi∣en to be vnlike to hem that they han hated. Certes onely is this the dyuine might. to the whiche might. euils ben than good whan it vsith the euils couenably & draweth out the effecte of ony good / as who seith that euil is good on̄e to the might of god. for the might of god ordeyneth th euil to good / for one ordre enbraceth al thinges / so that what wight de{per}teth from the reson of thilke ordre that is assig∣ned to him. algates yet he slideth into another ordre. so that nothing is leueful to folie in the royame of diuyne purue∣ance. as who seith nothing is without ordenance in the roy∣ame of diuine purueance / sith that the right stronge god gouerneth al thinges in this worlde. for it is not leuefull for men̄ to comphende by witte ne vnfolden by worde al the subtil ordenance & the disposicion of the diuine entent / for only it ought to suffise to han loked that god him self ma∣ker of al natures ordeyneth al thingis to good while that he hasteth to withholde the thingis that he hath maked into his semblan̄ce that is to seye foto withholden the thingis into good. for he him self is good / he chasith out al euils fro the boūde of his cominaltees by the ordre of the necessite desty∣nable / for which it folweth that if thou loke the purueance ordening the thingis that men̄ wenen be outrageo{us} or habon∣dant in erthes thou shalt not seen in no place no thing of euil. but I see now that thou art charged with the weighte of the question & wery with length of my reson & that thou bidest som swetenes of songe. take then̄e this draught. & whan thou art wel refresshed & refecte. thou shalt bee more stedfaste to stye into higher questions or thinges

And in thys
manere thys necessite slideth ayeyne into the contrarie {per}tie Ne it behoueth not nedes that thinges betiden that ben pur∣ueyed. but it behoueth nedes that thinges that been to co∣men bene pourueyed / but as it were trauailled. As who seyth / thilke answere procedeth right as thaugh men tra∣uailleden or were besye to enqueren the whiche thing is cause of whiche thing. As whether the prescience is cause of the necessite of thinges to comen / or ellis that the necessite of thinges to comen is cause of the pourueyance / But I en∣orce me not now to shewe that the betidinges of thinges y wiste biforn̄ is necessary / how so or in what manere that the ordre of causes hath hit self / al thugh that it ne seme not that the prescience bring in necessite of betiding to thin∣ges to comen / For certes if ony wighte sitte it behoueth by necessite that the oppynion bee sothe of him that coniecteth that he sitteth. And ayeinward also hit is of the contra∣rie / For if the opinion bee sothe of ony wighte byfore that he sittith. it behoueth by necessie that he sitte / then̄e is here ne∣cessite in that one. and in that other. For in that one ys necessite of sityng. And certes in that other is necessite of soth. But therfore ne sitteth not a wighte / for that the opinion of sitting is sothe / but the opinion is rather soth / for a wighte sittith beforn̄. And thus thagh that the cause of the sothe cometh of that other side / As wo seyth. all taugh the cause of the othe cometh of the stting and not of the true opynyon. Algates yet there is a com̄une neces∣site in that one and in that other. Thus suyth hyt that I maye make semblable skilles of the purueyance of god & of thinges to comen / For al thaugh that for the thinges
be to comen. therfore ben they purueyed / And not certes for they ben purueyed. therfore ne betide they not. Natheles behoueth it by ecessite / that eyther the thinges to comen bee purueyed of god / or els that the thinges that ben puruey∣ed of god betiden / & this thing only suffiseth ynough to destroye the fredome of our arbitre. that is to seyne of our fre wille / But certes now sheweth it well how fer fro the soth. and how vpsodowne is this thing / that we seye that the betyding of temporal thinges is cause of eterne presci∣ence / but for to wenen that god purueyeth. the thinges to comen for they ben to comen / what other thing is it but for to wene that thilk thinges that betiden whilome ben cause of thilk souerayne purueance that is god. And herto ad∣de I yet this thing. that right as whan that I wote / what a thyng is / it behoueth by necessite that thilk same thing betide / So foloweth it then̄e. that the betiding of the thyng ywist byforn̄. ne may not ben eschued. And atte laste if ony wight wene a thing to be other wyse than it is. It is not onely vnscience / but it is ful deceyuable opynion / full dyuers and full ferre from the soth of science / wherfore if ony thing be so to comen / that the betidyng of it ne be not certayne ne necessarye. who maye weten bifore that thylke thing is to comen. For righte as science ne maye not bee medled with falsenesse. As whoo seith that if I wote a thing / it ne may not be fals / that I ne wote it / right soo thilke thing that is conceyued by science. ne may not ben none other weyes than as it is conceyued. For that is the cause why that science wanteth leesing. as who seith / why that wyttyng receyueth not leesing of that it wote / For
it behoueth by necessite that euery thing by right as scyence {con}prehendeth it o ben / what shal I then̄e seyn̄. in whiche ma∣ner knoweth god beforn̄ all the thinges to comen. yf they be not certayn / for if that he deme that they be to come vnes∣chuable / & so may be that it is possible. that they ne shullen not comen god is deceyued / but only to trowe that god is deceyued. for to speke it with mouth. it is a felono{us} syn̄e But if that god wote that right so as thinges ben to co∣men so shal thy come / so that he wote egaly. as who seith in∣differently that thinges mowen ben done or els not done What is thilk presciēce that comphendeth no certain thing ne stable. or els what difference is there bytwene / th presci∣ence of thilk iape worthy dyuinyng of Tyresie dyuinour that saide / Al that I see qd e / eyther it shalbe / eyther it shal not be / or els hw moche is worth the dxuine presciēce more than the opinion of mankynde. If it so be that it demeth the thinges vncertin as men done / of the whiche domes of men the betiding nys not certayn. but if so be that none vncer∣teyn thing ne may not ben in him. that is right certein wel of all thinges  then̄e  the betiding certain of thilk thing whiche he hath wist beforn̄ frmely to comen / For whiche it foloweth that the fredomes of coūseilles ad of the wer∣kes of mankynde nys noon̄  Sith that the thought of god whiche that seeth alle thinges withouten errour of false∣nesse byndeth and constreyneth hem to a bytiding by necessite. And if this thing bee ones graunted and re∣ceyued. That y to sayne / that there nys noo free wille / thenne sheweth hit well / howe grete distruccion. and how grete domage there folowen of thynges of mankynde
For in ydel ben there than purposed and bihight medes / to good folk / and peynes to badde folke. sith no meouyng of fre corage voluntarye ne hath nought deserued hem. that is to seye neyther mede ne peyne. and it shuld seme then̄e that thilke thing is alder worst / whiche that is now de∣med for aldermoost Iuste and moost rightful. that is to seyne that shrewes ben punysshed. or els that good folke ben guerdoned. The whiche folke sene that her propre wille Ne assente hem not. to that one. ne to that other. that is to seyne. neyther to good ne to harme / but constreyned hem certayn necessite of thinges to comen. than shuld ther ne∣uer bee. ne neuer weren vice ne vertu / but it shuld bee con∣fusion of alle desertes medeled withouten discrecion / and yet there foloweth another inconuenient. of the whiche there ne maye bee thought / nomore felonous ne more wik. than hit is / This that soo as the ordre of thinges is ledde and cometh of the purueance of god. ne that noo thyng ys l∣ueful to the conseylles of mankinde. as who seyth that men han no power to doo noo thing / ne wilne nothing / thenne foloweth hit that oure vices ben referred to the maker of al good. As who seith. then̄e foloweth it. that god ought to han all the blame of oure vices / sith he constreyneth. vs by necessite to done vices. Thenne is there noo reason to ho∣pen in god. ne forto preyen god. For what shuld ony wight hope to god / or why shuld he prey to god. sith that the ordenāce of destenye / whiche that ne may not be enclind knitteth & streygneth al thinges that men may desiren / then̄e shuld there be done awey thilk only alliance bitwix god & men. that is to seyne to hopen and to preyen / But by the
prys of rightwisnesse & of veray mekenesse we deseruen the guerdon̄ of the dyuine grace whiche that is inestymable. that is to seyn. that is so grete that it ne may not ben ful preysed / And this is only the maner that is to seyn hope and preyers / For whiche hit semeth that men wol speke with god. And by reason of supplicacin ben conioyned to thilk clerenesse that is not approched no rather. or that men seken it & impetren̄ it. And if men ne wene not that hope ne prayer ne han noo strengthes by the necessite of thinges to comen y receyued / what thing is there then̄e by whiche we mowe be conioyned & cliuen to thilk souerayne prince of thinges. for whiche it behoueth by necessite that the lnage of mankynde as thou songe a litel here biforn̄ be departed and vnioyned from his well and faillen of his bygynnyng.

For whiche it behoueth. firste to shewe that no thing ne betideth / that hit ne betideth by necessite / so that it maye appere that the prescience is signe of necessite. or ellis if there ner no necessite / certes thilke prescience ne mighte not bee signe of thyng that nys not.
But certes it is nowe certeyn that the proue of this y sus∣tened by stidfaste reason̄ ne shal not ben ladde ne proued by signes ne by Argumentes / taken fro withoute / but by causes couenable and necessarie / but thou maist seyne / how may it be that the thinges ne betiden not that ben purueyed to comen / but certes right as we trowen. that the thinges whiche that the purueance wote beforn̄ to comen ne bee not to betiden. But that ne shuld we not demen̄ / but rather all thaugh they shall betiden / yet ne haue they noo necessite of her kynde to betiden. And this maist thou lightly ap∣perceyuen by this that I shall seyne. For wee seen many thinges whan they been biforn̄ oure eyen̄. right as men seen the Carter worchyng in the tournyng and in the atem∣pering or addressing of his cartes or charryettes and by this maner. As who seith / maist thou vnderstande of all other weakmen̄. is there thenne ony necessite. as who seyth in oure loking that constreyneth or conpellith any of thilk thinges to be done soo. B.

And thilke same thinges all thaugh men
hadden wiste hem beforne. yet they han fre betidinges / For right as science of thinges present ne bringeth in no neces∣site to thinges that men done. right so to the prescience of thinges to comen ne bringeth in none necessite to thinges to betiden. but thou maist sayne that of thilk same hyt ys doubted / as whether that of thilk thinges that ne han non̄ issues & bitidinges necessaries. if therof may ben ony pre∣sciēce. for certes they semen to discorden̄ / for thou wenest that if that thinges ben̄ seyne before that necessite foloweth hem And if necessite failleth hem they ne might not ben wist before / & that nothing may be comprehended by science. but certain / And if tho thinges ne han n certain betidinges ben puruyed as certain. It shuld be derknesse of opinion not sothfastnesse of science. & thou wenest that it be diuerce fro the hoolnesse of sciēce that ony man shulde deme a thing to be otherwise than it is / it self / & the cause of this errour is. that of al the thinges that euy wight hath knowe. they wene that tho thinges ben knowe only by the strength & by the nature of the thinges that ben wist or know. & it is all the contrarie / for al that euer is know / it is rather {con}phended & knowe. not after his strength & his nature / but after the faculte. that is to seyne the power & the nature of hem that knowen / & for that this thing shulde now shewe by a short ensample the roūdnes of a body. otherwise than the sight of the eye knoweth it / & otherwise the touching the loking by casting of his bemes waiteth & seeth from a fer al the body to geder without meouing of it self / but the touching cleueth to the roūde body & meoueth aboute the enuiron̄ing & {con}prehendeth the {per}ties by roūdnes / & the man̄ him self otherwise beholdeth him
And otherweyes ymagynacion / and otherwise reason / & otherwise intelligence. For the witte comprehendeth with out forth the figure of the body of man̄. that is vnstablis∣shed / in the matere subiecte. But the ymagynacion compre∣hendeth only the figure withoute the matier. reason sur∣moūteth ymagynacion. and comprehendeth by vniuersal loking the com̄une speche but the eye of Intelligence is hi∣gher / for it surmoūteth the enuyron̄yng of the vniuersite & loketh ouer that by pure subtilite of thoughte. Thilke sa∣me simple fourme of man̄ that is perdurable in the dyuine thoughte / in whiche this ought gretly to be considered / that the hiest strength forto comprehenden thinges / embraseth & conteyneth the lower strength. but the lower strength. ne ariseth not in no maner. to the hier strength. for wytte ne may comphende nothing out of mater. ne the ymaginacōn ne loketh not the vniusal spieces. ne reson ne takith not the simple forme / so as intelligēce taketh it / but intelligēce that loketh al abouen. whan it hath comphendeth the fourme / it knoweth & demeth al the thinges. that ben vnder the forme But she knoweth hem in thilk maner. in the whiche it com∣phendeth thilk same simple forme. that ne may neuer been knowen of none of that other. that is to seyne to none of tho thre forsaide strengthes of the soule / for it knoweth the vniusite of reson & the figure of ymagynacōn̄. & the sensi∣ble material. conceyued by witte. ne it ne vsith not / ne of reson / ne of ymagynacion̄ ne of witte without forth. but hit beholdeth al thinges. soo as I shal seye / by a stroke of thought fermely without discours of collacion / Certes reson whan it lokith ony thing vniuersal it ne vsith not

Thenne thilke thing that suffreth temporal condicion / al thaugh that it neuer began to be / ne thaugh it neuer cesse to be / As Aristotiles demed of the worlde. And al thaugh the life of it be stretched with in∣finite of tyme / yet algates nys it noo suche thing as men myght trowen by right that it is eterne. for al thaugh that it comprehende and embrace the space of the life infinite / yet algates ne embraceth it not the space of the life al to ge∣der / For it ne hath not the futures that be not yet.

And for thy if wee wollen putten̄ worthy names to thinges that folowen plato. late vs seye thenne sothly that god is eter∣ne. and that the world is perpetuell / Thenne sith euery Iuggement knoweth and comprehendeth by his owne na∣ture thinges that ben subgiett vnto him / there is to god al wayes an eterne and a presentarye estate. And the sy∣ence of him that ouerpassith alle temporall momente dwel∣lith in simplicite of his presence / And enbraceth and considereth all the infinite spaces of tymes preterites and of tymes futures.

For addeth thy beholding any necessite. to thilke thinges whiche that thou beholdest presente. B. Naye quod I. Phīa. Certes quod she thenne. yf men myghten maken any digne com∣parison or collacion of the presence dyuine / and of the pre∣sence of mankynde. right so as ye sne somme thinges in this temporall presence. right so seeth God alle thyng by his etrne presnce. wherfore this dyuine presence ne chaū∣gth not the nature of the proprete of thinges. but beholdeth suhe thinge present to hm wad. as they shulden bety∣dn̄ to yuward in tyme to comen̄. Ne hit ne confoundeth not th Iuggmentes of thinges but by one sighte of hys thoughte he knoweth the thynges to comen as well neces∣sarye as not necessarie. ryght soo whanne ye sene to ge∣d a man̄ walke on the erthe / and the snne arisen in the heuene. All bee hit soo that ye sene to gde that one and that other / Yet neuertheles ye demn and decernen / tht that one ys voluntarye. And that other is necessarye Ryghte soo thenne the dyuyne lokyng beholding alle tnges vnder hym ne troubleth not the qualite of thyn∣ges whiche that ben certeynly present to hym ward / But
as to the condicion̄ of tyme forsothe they ben future. For whche it foloweth that this nys none oppinion but rather a stedfaste knowyng strengthed by sothenesse. that whan that god knoweth ony thing to be. he ne vnwote not that thilk thing wanteth necessite to be / That is to seyne that whan god knoweth ony thing to betide. he wote wel that it ne hath no necessite to betide / and if thou seest here that thilk thing that god seeth to betide / it ne may not vnbetide As who sith it mote betide by necessite / & that thou streig∣ne me to this name of the necessite / certes I wol wel con∣fessen & byknowen a thing of ful sadde trouth. but vn̄eth shal there ony wight mowen seen it / or come therto / but he be beholder of the dyuine thought. for I wol answeren to the thus / that thilk thing that is future whan it is referred to the dyuine knowing / then̄e is it necessarye / but crte whan it is vnderstanden in his own̄ kinde men seen it vtterly fre & absolute fro al necessite. for certes thr ben two maneres of necessitees. that oo necessite is simple as thus / that hyt behoueth by necessite. that al men be mortal or deedly / An other necessite is cōdicionel. as thus / if thou wotest that a man̄ walketh / it behoueth by necessie that he walke. thilke thing then̄e that ony wight hath knowen to be / it ne maye not ben none other than he knoweth it to be / but this condi∣cōn ne draweth not with her. thilk necessite simple / for cer∣tes this necessite condicinel. the {pro}pre nature of it. ne ma∣kith it not / but the adieccōn of the condicion maketh it / for none necessite constreyneth a man̄ to gone / that goth by his {pro}pre wil / albe it so that whan he goth / that it is necessarye that he gooth. right on the same manere then̄e. if that the
purueance of god seeth ony thing psente / then̄e mote thilk thing be by necessite. Al thaugh that it haue noon necessi∣te of his owne nature / but certes the futures that betiden by fredome of arbitrie / god seeth them all to gedres presentes These thinges then̄e if they be referred to the dyuine sight then̄e ben they maked necessarie by the condicion of the di∣uyne knowing / but certes if thilke thinges ben considered by hem slf / they ben absolute of necessite / And ne forleten not ne cessen not of the liberte of her owne nature / then̄e cer∣tes withouten doubte al the thinges shulden ben done. whi∣che that god wote beforn̄. that they ben to comen / & betiden of free arbitre. or of free wille / that albe it so. that they be∣tiden / yet algates ne lese they not her propre nature in being By the whiche. first or they weren done. they hadden power not to han betidde / B / Wht is this to seyne thenne qd I that hings ne be not necessarie by her {pro}pre nature. so that they comen in all maners in the liknesse of necessite / by cō∣dicion̄ of the dyuine science. Phīa. This is the difference quod she. that tho thinges whiche that I purposed the a litell here biforne. That is to seyne the sonne arising. and the man̄ walking. that ther whiles that thilk thinges ben done / they ne might not ben vndone. Natheles that one of hem or it was done / it behoueth by necesste that it was do∣ne. but not that other / right so it is hre that the thynges whiche that god hath present withouten doubte thy shul∣en been / but somme of em descendeth of the Nature of thynges / as the sonne arising. And somme descendeth of the power of the doers. a the man̄ walking / B. then̄e said I / no wrong that if these thinges be referred to the dyuine
knowing. thenne ben they necessarie / And if they ben con∣sidered by hem self / thenne ben they absolute. fro the boūde of necessite. right so as all thinges that appereth or sheweth to the witte. yf thou referre hem to reson. it is vniuersall / And if thou loke it / or referre it / to it self. then̄e is it sin∣guler. but now if thou seyste thus. that if that it be in my power to chaungen my pourpose. thenne shall I voyden the purueyannce of God. whan perauenture I shal haue chaū∣ged the thinges whiche that he knoweth biforne / Philoso∣phia / Thenne shal I answeren the thus. Certes thou maist wel chaunge thi purpose. but for as moche as the presente othnesse of the dyuine puruean̄ce beholdeth that thou maist chaunge thi pourpose. and wheder thou chaunge hit or noo And whiderward that thou tourne hit / thou ne maiste not eschue the dyuine prescience. ryghte soo thow ne maist not flee / the sighte of the present tye / all thaugh that thou tourne thy selfe by thi free wille. in to dyuerce Accions. But thow maiste seyne ageyne to this thus / How shalle hit thenne bee / Shalle not the dyuyne science been chaun∣ged by my disposicion. whanne that I woll one thyng nowe / and nowe another thing. And thilke prescience ne semeth hit not to ntrechaunge stonndes of knowyng As whoo seyth. Ne shalle hit not semen to vs. that the dyuyne prescience entrechaungeth his dyuerce stonndes of knowyng / So that hit knowe somme tyme oon̄ thyng And somme tyme yt knoweth the contrarie of that thing Philosophia. Noo forsoth quod she / For the dyuine ight renneth biforne and seeth all the futures and clepeth hem ayyne. and retourneth hem to the {pro}pre prescience of hys
propre knowing / Ne he entrechaūgeth not so as thou wenst the ston̄des of his forknowing. as now this. now that. but he dwelling ay cometh beforn̄. & enbaseth at oo stroke / all the mutacions / & this prescience to comprehenden & to seen al thinges. God ne hath not taken it. f the betidinges of thinges to comen / but of his propre simplicite / And herby is assoled thilke thinges that thou puttest a litil here by forn̄. That is to seyne that it is vnworthy thing to sene that oure futures yeuen cause of the prescience of god. For certes strengthe of the dyuine science. whiche that enbraseth alle thinges / by his presentarye knowyng establissheh ma∣nre to all thinges / And it ne oweth not to latter thyn∣ges.
