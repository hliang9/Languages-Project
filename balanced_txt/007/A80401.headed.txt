THE True Protestants PRAYER, OR The godly mans supplication unto Al∣mihgty God, for the afflicted Church in IRELAND. Composed by that learned and religious Divine, Francis Cook Batchelor in Divinity, and Preacher at Yoxall in STAFFORD-SHIRE. Humbly desiring all godly Christians, for the Lord Christs sake, to joyne with him in Prayer for their afflicted Brethren. O Almighty Lord, and in Iesus Christ our most mercifull Father, although by reason of our grievous back-slidings and Rebellions against thee, we be altogether unwor∣thy to put up any petitions unto thy Maiestie for our selves; yet encouraged by the manifold experience of thy mercies in hearing of sinners, wee presume to suppli∣cate thine Almighty goodnesse in the behalfe of our di∣stressed brethren in the Kingdome of Ireland: We confesse thou art iust (O most mighty Lord) and therefore for their wickednesse, hast thou hid thy face from that Nation; yea, thou hast filled it with dead bo∣dies, whom thou hast slaine in thine anger; yet behold them wee pray thee in mercy, bring health unto them and cure them, and reveale unto them the abundance of peace and truth: Lord return their captivity, and build them up as at the first, cleanse them from all their iniquities, & par∣don all their sins, whereby they have stirred up thy wrath against them, and make their name to thee a name of ioy, and before all the Nations of the Earth a prayse and an honour, for the good thou dost unto them, and to themselves an everlasting comfort; because of all the goodnesse, and for the prosperity which thou wilt procure them; and let there be heard againe among these our Kingdomes the voyce of ioy and gladnesse, of the Bride∣groome and of the Bride, and in all mouth's, the voyce of prayse and thanksgiving unto the Lord of Hostes, because his Mercy endureth for ever.
