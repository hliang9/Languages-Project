DIRECTIONS FOR THE Right Receiving OF THE Lords Supper. Question. TO whom doth the Sacrament of the LORD's SƲPPER be∣long? Answer. Not to the unworthy, but to the worthy. Q. Who are unworthy Guests at the Lords Table?
A. All grosly Ignorant, and openly Scandalous. Q. Why are all grosly Ignorant to be kept back from the Sacrament? A. Because being Ignorant, they want an eye to discern the Lord's Body, a Hand to receive him, and a Mouth to feed upon him: and therefore in so coming they eat and drink Judgement to themselves, 1 Cor. 11.29. Q. Why are openly Scandalous to be kept from the Sacrament? A. Because such in presuming to touch such holy things with unholy hearts, lips and lives, they dishonour and provoke God; pollute and prophane his Ordinance; grieve and make sad the Godly; and make them∣selves guilty of Murdering Christ, and Dmning their own souls, 1 Cor. 11.27. Q. Who are grosly Ignorant? A. Such as are ignorant of the Nature, Ends and Use of the Sacrament, and not able to give a Reason of their Faith and hope to be saved, 1 Pet. 3.15. Q Who are openly Scandalous? A. Such as live and lye Impenitently in a course of Sinning, and by their speeches and practices give just offnce to any of the Godly, 1 Cor. 10.32, 33.
Thus of such as are unworthy Guests to come to the Lords Table. Q. Who are worthy Communiants?Worthy Commu∣nicants. A. Such as are willing and in some mea∣sure able to give a Reason of their Faith and Hope to be Saved, and whose Conversati∣on is suitable to their Profession, Ephes. 4.1. Q. Are there any worthy in themselves of this honour? A. No, but the Lord is pleased to account and accept them so, in, and for, and through the Righteousness of Christ imputed to them, Rev. 3.4. And because their desire, and endeavour is to walk worthy of, and suitable to their profession, Ephes. 4.1. Col. 2.6. Q. What is required of those that would come as worthy Guests to the Table of the lord? A. A Due Preparation before,Requisite to a Right Receiving. A Right Disposition in, and an Answerable Carriage after. Q. Why is every one bound Duly to pre∣pare himself? A. Because in coming unpreparedly he not only dishonours God, and pollutes the Ordinance; but makes himself Guilty of the
Body and Blood of Christ, and  eateth and drinketh Judgement to himself, 1 Cor. 11.27, 29. Q. What is that Preparation that is re∣quired? A. It is double, Habitual, and Actual. Q. What is Habitual Preparation? Habitual Prepara∣tion.A. The Examination of our selves, Whether we have the Habit or Seed of those Graces that do qualifie and fit us for the Sacrament. Q. Why is every one to examine whether he have those Graes? A. 1. Because this is expresly required, 1. Cor. 11.28. 2. Because without Examination, we cannot come to know the truth of Grace in us, nor act our Graces, Jer. 8.6. 3. Because without a work of grace, the Sacrament will be but a Seal to a blank; of no benefit, but much hurt. Q. What are those Graces that we are to examine whether we have them? A. They are six: 1. Saving Know∣ledge. 2. Faith. 3. Repentance. 4. O∣bedience. 5. Love: and 6. A Holy de∣sire, or an Appetite to the Sacrament. Q. Why is every one bound to examine whether he have a competent measure of Knowledge?

Because we shall have no salvation, but eternal destruction, without Know∣ledge, 2 Cor. 4.3, 4. 2 Thes. 1.7, 8, 9. Q. What is Knowledge? A.

To confirm and strengthen our Faith in the Assurance of those good things pro∣mised in the Covenant of Grace, especial∣ly the Pardon of Sin, and Eternal Life by Jesus Christ, Rom. 4.11. Mat. 26.28. Joh. 6.54. 1 Cor. 11.23, 24, 25, 26. How the Sacrament streng∣thens faith above the Word.Q. How doth the Sacrament of the Lords Supper strengthen Faith above the Ministry of the Word? A. 1. As it Representeth Christ and his benefits, to the Eye and every Sense, 1 Joh. 1.1, 2. whereas in the Ministry of the Word, he is Represented to the Ear only. 2. As it is a Seal annexed to the Cove∣nant of Grace, 1 Joh. 1.1, 2, 3.
Q. What are the signs in the Lords Sup∣per? A. Bread and Wine,The Signs. and the Actions of the Minister, and the Receivers in and about them. Q. What is signified by the Bread and Wine? A. The Body and Blood of Christ.Things sig∣nified. Q. But the Body and Blood of Christ are in Heaven, and how then can we receive that being here on earth? A. Although we receive Christ truly and really, yet not corporally or carnally, but spiritually, by faith, Joh. 6.3. Faith goeth from Earth to Heaven, and taketh hold on Christ, and the Spirit comes from Heaven to Earth, and applyeth Christ unto us, 1 Joh. 4.24. Q. But the Papists say, the Bread and Wine are transubstantiated, or turned into the very body and blood of Christ, and there∣fore we receive him not only Spiritually but Corporally. A. That is a false, gross, and absurd Doctrine contrary to Scripture, sense and reason; 1. Contrary to Scripture which expresly saith, The Heavens must contain him untill the restitution of all things, Acts 3.21. And at the last day, he shall descend
from Heaven with a shout, 1 Thes. 4.16.  2. Contrary to sense, for we see and taste nothing but bread and wine, 1 Joh. 1.12. And Christs Body and Blood remained distinct from this Bread and Wine, when he spake those words, This is my Body; and 3. Contrary to reason, Because Christ ha∣ving a true Humane Body like to us, Heb. 2.14. and 4.15. and being ascended in his body up to Heaven, Mark 16.19. he cannot be here on Earth too, at the same time, for it is contrary to the nature of a body to be in many places at once. The signi∣fication of the Acti∣ons.Q. What is signified by the Ministers ta∣king, and setting apart the Bread and Wine, when he comes to the Table? 1. Of set∣ting apart.A. God the Fathers setting of his Son apart from all Eternity for our Redempti∣on, Heb. 7.26. Q. What is signified by the Ministers action of Consecrating, or seeking a Bles∣sing upon the Bread and Wine? 2. Of Con∣secration.A. God the Fathers actual sending of Christ, and Christs actual performing the great work of Redemption for us, Gal. 4.4. Q. What is signified by the Ministers action of Breaking the Bread and Pouring out the Wine?3. Of Breaking and Pour∣ing out. A. All the Sufferings of Christ; espe∣cially, the
Breaking of his Body, and  the Shedding of his Blood upon the Cross, Heb. 9.14. Q. What is signified by the Ministers Bringing, and Offering the Bread and Wine? A. God the Father freely offering of Christ,4. Of Bringing and Offer∣ing. and Christ freely offering of him∣self, with all his Benefits to true Believers. Q. What is signified by the Receivers Re∣ceiving the Bread and Wine at the hand of the Minister? A. His Believing of the truth of what Christ hath done, and God hath Promised.5. Of Re∣ceiving. Q. What is signified by your Eating the Bread, and Drinking the Wine? A. The Applying of all that Christ hath Done, and God hath Promised,6. Of Eat∣ing and Drinking. to my self in particular; so as to say with Thomas, Joh. 20.28. My Lord, and my God. Thus you see what those things are that you are to know, that you may come as worthy Guests to the Lords Table.

Whether we have received any more Assurance of Gods
Love, Peace of Conscience; any more strength of Grace, and power over Cor∣ruption. Q. What if we cannot find this, what are we then to do? A. To search out the cause, whether we were not careless in our Preparation before, or in our Disposition and behaviour in the time of Receiving, and to humble our selves accordingly. Q. What if our Conscience tell us that we were not willingly faulty this way: but that we endeavoured to prepare our selves to it, and behave our selves in it as we ought: what are we then to do, if we cannot find comfort? A. To wait upon God for the discovery of his Love to us. Because, as Physick doth not presently work, nor Meat presently nourish: So neither doth the Sacrament alwayes presently comfort; but in Gods time. Q. What if I find present Benefit and Comfort, what is then my Duty? A. To give God the Glory of his Grace in it; and to labour to walk humbly, and watchfully for the future, that we do not lose it. Q. What is another Duty in Private, be∣sides Examination?
A. 2. Reformation.2. Reforma∣tion. That we remember to observe, and make good all our vows and promises unto God, as we expect he should make good his unto us. Q. What are those things that we promise to God in the Sacrament? A. To walk more holily, humbly, spiri∣tually, and heavenly before God. To serve him more faithfully, cheerfully and fruit∣fully; To watch more against sin, and to resist the motions, temptations, and occasi∣ons of it. And to watch more over Grace, to cherish the motions of it. And to lay hold on all opportunities of honouring God, and of doing and receiving good. Q. Why is every one to be so careful of remembring, and making good his vows and promises of more circumspect walking after the Sacrament? A. Because otherwise we cannot expect that God should make good his vows, and promises unto us: we should but mock with God, and deceive our own souls. We should deprive our selves of peace and com∣fort, and expose our selves to Gods displea∣sure for the future. For it is better never to vow, than not to perform that which we have vowed, Eccles. 5.4, 5. FINIS.
