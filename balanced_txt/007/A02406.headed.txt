The Reasons For vvhich the most Jllustrious and most potent Prince, and LORD, LORD Gustavus Adolphus, King of the Svvethens, Gothes and Vandals, great Prince of Finland, Duke of Esthonia and Carelia, and Lord of Ingria, vvas at length Forced to March vvith an army into Germany. Printed according to the copie of Stralsound. Anno 1630.
IT is an ancient proverbe, that no man is able to inioy peace, any longer, then it pleaseth his neighbour: how true this is his Ma: off Swethen hath, to his great dam∣madg proved, in these yeares, and doth yet daily: for hombeit, it was his cheefecare and indevour, in all the time of his Raigne, to keepe inviolable Frindship with all his neighbours, and especially, with the States of Germany; that peace and tranquillity might flo∣rish on every side, and that trade, Comerce, and all oth repe∣aceable indevours, might be exercized, to the mutuall good off all Nations: yet could he obtaine nothing more, then that, by some haters of the publick peace, after that thay had wasted almost all Germany with fire and sworde, greater snares were laid, from yeare to yeare, against his security. his Ma: was advertised long ago, and that, not of a few States of Germany, to provide for himself more maturely, whi∣le this flame was yet spreading it self in Germany, and that he should not think, thay would be more favourable or frindly to him, if thay were admitted to aproach nearer; but that he would then, presently, take Armes, come into Germany, and with common forces, quench the common burning, being assured, that his owne cause was then in hand, when kis neighbours howse was a burning. neither was there then wanting to his Ma: either excellent occa∣sion, his subiects inviting him, or iust cause, his oppressed friends and Allies so earnestly requiring aide and succour. but still hoping, that at lenth, thay would prove more equi∣table, then so impotently to insult, over their harmles
Neighbours, measuring their manners, according to his own nature, he chose rather to committ his own security for a while, to the goodnes of god and an innocent Conscience, then rashly therin to attempt any thing. But when in the yeare 1626. by reason of his own warr, which passed betweene him and the King and common wealth of Pole, he was marching into Prussia, a Provin∣ce of the Kingdom off Pole, perceiving more narrowly, what he might promise himself, of those foresaid wasters and spoilers of Germany, he found his friends admoni∣tions to be so farr, from being vaine, that the nearer his eni∣myes approached to these Baltick provinces of Germany, so manny the more and greater occasions of warre he percei¦ved to be sowen by them dayly, even against him: for in the first place, violating the law of Nations, thay intercep∣ted his Ma. letters sent to the Prince of Transilvania, ope∣ned them, and of malice against his Ma. published them with a fained interpretation, casting withall his messenger into prison; then also, howbeit there was oftentimes no small hope, of redressing and, composing of the long con∣tinued cōtroversy, betwixt Swethen and Polland, by frind∣ly treaties, the Commissaries of both kingdomes meeting from yeare to yeare, yet these enimyes of common peace, caused, by their reiterated messengers and letters to Polland, that no peace should be made with Swethen, vntill such time, as thay had accomplished their determinations in the Romane Impire; putting the Polonians in hope, the States of Germany being once ranged in order, thay should then haue them no slow aiders and assisters to subdue Swethen. And to the end thay might effectuat, in deede, what by word thay promised: and that so farr as in them lay, thay might both deprive Swethen of all meanes, and strengthen the Pole, thay did not only prohibit all exportation of Soul∣diers and Armes, out of Germany, to the King off Swe∣then,
leaving withall the same free vnto the Polonians, then his enimyes; but also, when this seemed a small matter, and thay perceived, notwithstanding hereof, that abundance off souldiers did flock, to the most illustrious King off Sweth. not only from other parts, but also (and that against their wills) out of Germany it Self, the yeare next following, 1627 thay sent the Duke off Holsatia against his Ma. with  great Army, into Prussia, and that not, vnder his own, or vnder the Poles; but vnder the Colours off the Emperour of Rome himselff. Neither content with this kostility; but that also thay might vtterly seclude the kingdom off Sweth: from all Le∣ague of society with mankinde: thay did not only wrong∣fully spoile the innocent subiects of his Ma. arriving at the coast off Germ. for Commerce, taking their goods by for∣e, and confiscating their schipps: but also, thay did mainely effectuat that, at Lubick and the rest of the townes off the vandalls, by their Scouts, sent out, in shew, that thay might restraine trading to these townes only; but in very deede, that thay might withdraw the same, from the subiects off the kingdom of Swethen, and that by this occasion, thay might gather together schipps, and a Navie, by which, thay might belch out this venom, conceaved in their minds, u∣pon the Baltick sea it self; as in the yeare next following, thay id manifestly schew, by the monstrows titles off General∣ity off the sea coasts, and by taking in possession, as well the Land places and Fortifications, as the Coasts, and havēs of Mechlinburgh and Pomer, with the acts ensewing theron. Let any man, who is able, Iudg, that all these things perhaps ought to haue bin tollerated, and for avoyding off curiosity in other mens affaires, to haue bin passed by in pa∣tience, while thay kept them-selves as yet, vpon the Conti∣nent, opposit to Sweth: yet certainly, after thay were exten∣ded to the sea it selff, by choosing the Haven off the Sound
for a receipt of their Piracy; by how much the more this was done, to the great preiudice off all the States, who, by any necessity what soever, did depend vpon this Sea; so much the les ought it to haue bin tollerated by his Ma. off Sweth: especially, seing the iust protection off this sea was off ould, peculiar, to the Kings off Sweth. Therfore, so manny iniuries also being added to the for∣mer advertizement off Friends, when his Ma. (being now so much the more wary) in the spring off the yeare, 1628. was againe passing over to Prussia, being carefull off no∣thing, more, then that he might remedy these incommodi∣ties, by some honest meanes; it fell out that the Ambassa∣dors off the towne off Stralsound did come vnto his Ma. in Prussia; who did heavily complaine, that, allthough their harmless citty, had committed nothing, either against the Roman Imperour, or against the Impire it selff, nor a∣gainst any State off the Impire, for which it was so farr, that it was at any time Cited, or Accused, or convicted, or con∣demned; that even by an Emperial decree, it was declared innocent, and secured off withdrawing off the Army, which besiedged it: yet such was ye iniquity off that noisom army; that, vilipending their innocency, neglecting the laws and constitutions, off the Empire, contemning the Contract, made, with those off Pomer at, Arnhem, and not regarding manny other Covenants, made at divers ti∣mes, (by all which it might seeme, thay were sinceerely se∣cured) neither considering the great sommes off mony, vniustly exacted, and paid; with gifts and presents; violating the very sanctity, both off religious and common peace: it did first, wast the Neighbouring villages off the Citty, it did build divers fortes, vpon the territories off the towne, it did fortify the Ile of Benholm, lying neare vpon the haven, to the preiudice of the towne; after it had taken it, by treac∣hery, without any denunciation of enmity: it seased vpon
all passages; from the continent, to the Ile off Rugg, and from the towne to the continent, and back, from the conti∣nent to the towne, it did vex the Citticens, with divers ri∣diculous treaties, and having exhausted them by great tri∣bute, it chardged them also with Garrisons, and so, deman∣ded the haven it self, with their schipps and munition: and at lenth, all these being denied them, by their priviled∣ged liberty, it did press the towne it selff with a strait Siedge, and did persecute it, most vnworthily, to the very last, with fire and sword. Whenas therfore, the Empe∣rours decrees, did here effectuat nothing; the most Illu∣strious Duke off Pomer, would not help them; when thay were esteemed, as left of all the society off the Hanse townes: according to the Law, and custom off Nations, by favour off their priviledges, by example off their An∣cestors, being compelled, to implore the aide off a Forrain Power, vntill that suddain tempest off warr, should lea∣ve raging; thay did accept, for a while, the Garrisons off the most Illustrious King off Denmark, as most ready to re∣pell the suddennes off the first assault: yet, least that schould turn to their future preiudice, as if thay had associated them∣selves, with the Emperours enimies; at last thay found no more equitable, and present remedy, then to commit their oppressed liberty, to the tuition, off the most Illustrious King off Swethen, as to a newtrall, and friendly King. The most illustrious King off Sweth: therfore, Consi∣dering, in the first place, that thay could promise thēselves, no more favour, from so vnsatiable attemps, off an army, noted with so many hostilities; and next, marking, that the desires off this afflicted citty, were grounded, vpon divi∣ne and humane laws; as also, considering that bond off ob∣servance, vicinity, common religion, liberty and commer∣ce, by which that Citty was allway adicted, both to his Ancestors, the most Illustrious Kings, and Kingdom of
Sweth: and to himselff: and lastly, what danger it should breede, not only to himselff and the kingdom off Sweth) but also, to all his neighbours, if in this haven, any nest of Piraticall excursion were setled, by the privat ambition of any whatsoever: he could no longer refuse, by any, either meanes or equity, for the benefit off his Neighbours and friends, as also, off his own, and off the publick and com∣mon security (in the meane time) to succour and releve the oppressed, who so earnestly intreated his help, com∣fort and Councell. By which his intention, Though this was effectuated, that the Emperiall Iniunctions did keepe their own authority, and the Baltick sea should be made secure for all Nations, who haue any interest the∣rin, and that the towne of Stralsovnd, by reason of the friendly intervention of his Ma. being freed from the Garrisons, off the most illustrious King off Denmark (as then hostile) should be kept, both to its own liberty, and to the Empire of Rome, as the League, made with the towne cōcerning the same, doth yet clearly demōstrate: Notwith∣standing, it was never a whit the more obtayned, that those perturbers of peace, should yet remit any thing of their ho∣stile attempts and purposes, but by occasion theroff thay waxed more hot, in seeking the destruction therof, both by Lande and Sea: for finding themselves to be frustrate of that haven, thay sett vpon the haven of Wissmar and others: nei∣ther being content with their own shipps, thay called from Danswijck, the Navie of the enimys of the kingdom of Sweth: into their society, and thay began, so to annoy the sea neare adioining, that his Ma. was at length forced (if he would have the sea, and Commerce safe) to keepe them al∣so inclosed there by his Navie (and that, not without great expence and dammadg) vntill that, that yeare should at length be expired securely in som kinde. Yet notwithstanding, that the most Illustrious king off
Sweth: might not herefore in any kinde remit his con∣stant and perpetual care for the peace, and common quiet∣nes of these Nations; but rather that he might try all waies and meanes, to com to a friendly transaction: when he vn∣derstood that a treaty of peace was instituted at Lubeck betwixt the Roman Emperour and the king of Denmark, in the beginning of the yeare 1629. he thought it expe∣dient, to send his Ambassadors also thither in opportune time, that thay might both accommodat this matter of the towne of Stralsound, and compose all other Ielousies, which were bred in these yeares, and that also (iff thay could help any thing therin) by their mediation thay might promove the treaty it selff to the wished end: for thus he made account with himself, seeing that by occa∣sion off that warr, which passed between the Romane Em∣perour, and the king off Denmark, many suchlike Iea∣lousies seemed to haue bin bredd, that neither peace could be concluded with the king off Sweth: Stralsound being excluded, neither could that towne be bound to any Con∣ditions, it self not being comprehended in the Treaty, by reason of the mutuall contracts, agreed vpon with that Citie concerning that matter. But howbeit the most Illustrious king off Denmark did thankfully admitt the Comming of the said Ambassage; neither was the same with less courtesie and decēcie desired by letters from the other party; yet such was the humani∣ty, wherwith he was requited, that his solemn Ambassage was not only not admitted, or at least thought worthy off any answer, by letter; but also with great indignity repul∣sed, and commanded, to keepe not only from the towne off Lubeck, but also from the whole territory of Germa∣ny, vpon hazard and threatning of extremity. Which only indignity, though in the Account off all Nations, it be allway esteemed worthy of most iust revenge,
and there seemed no cause to remaine, why more rough remedies, should be any longer abstayned from: yet seeing the Deputies of the Emperour did at Length (in March, after that thay of Sweth: were recaled into the Kingdom againe) acknowledg the letters of the kings Ambassadg, by an Answer by letter, by which, as by way of excuse, thay would seem to mollify the iniquity of the former sentence; his Ma. also, in the meane time, esteemed the same to have proceeded rather from some evill Councellers, then from publick Councell; neither did he yet suffer it to be such, as might seem to be sufficient, yea even ioyned with the rest, to Committ his mutuall States to a iust warr, especially seeing the said deputies did withall signify, that thay had no power to treate with any other then the king of Denmark, yet thay knew certainly, that if the matter were yet referred, either to the Emperour himselff, or to the Duke of Fridland, thay should receiue an answer, which might give them content. It might now seem an vnworthie thing, to expose his patience any longer to such ridiculous proceedings, it ha∣ving alreadie bene wronged so many wayes: it being also very doubtfull, whither, or how, the matter might be re∣lated by the party offended, to the imperour (with whom heretofore, no such like communication had bene vsuall, to his Ma.) all wayes being prohibited in the whole Ro∣man Empire, and the treatie of Lubec drawing so neere an end: yet notwithstanding, that no labour might be omit∣ted for the desired publick tranquillitie, and that no diffi∣culty might be any hinderance thervnto, all contrary con∣siderations being laid aside, when the matter could not be related to the Emperour himself, his Ma. was at lenth, by the illustrous counsel of the Kingdom off Swethen indu∣ced, presently in the month off April, not only to write to the Electorall convention, as being the cheif prop off the
Roman Empire, to which, these proceedings with forrain kings, were thought to be most displeasing, and to sue for op∣portune remedies; but also to give consent, that a deputie, should be withall sent from the counsell, to the generall of the troups himself, who by his presence might try, whither those controversies, which seemed to be bred betwixt the mutuall armies, might not be taken away by the Conven∣tion of the same; whervpon his Mas. Chamberlane the Illu∣strious L. Steno Bielke L. Baron, was presently sent to Kro∣ker, with adjoined power, that, if he found the mynds of the contrary partie inclinable to peace, he should constitu∣te a stilstand of armes for Stralsound, while that farder preparatories of treating being made, more commissioners might Follow, who might refer the whole busines to a full transaction. But, when he, in the beginning of the spring aryved at Stralsound, and found the mynds of the adverse party, and the whole face of the matter changed to the wor∣se, and that the former hostilities, were not only not taken away, but also augmented with fresh hostilities from day to day; as also Stralsound again to be assaulted, with divers onsets, all the havens of the coast to be armed, for to pray vpon the Swetian sea; and which is the greatest of all ini∣quities, that a compleat army was again privilie sent to Prus∣sia, without any denunciation of warr, and that vnder the Emperours owne Marchall off the forces of Arnheimbia. this change did indeed, stay him from proceeding any farder, as it was fit; yet notwistanding, that he might in some mea∣sure discharge his cōmission; he wrote to the Duke of Frid∣lād, for what causes he was dispatched, and having protested against the iniquitie of that armie, that was sent over, he de∣syred that both it, and all other hostilities might be stayed, iff the answere off the deputies of Lubec might other wayes seem to be sincere: But the Duke of Fridlād was so far, aither from recalling the army, or shewing any readines to treate:
with greater mocking, he confirmed his subdeputies ans∣wers to be meerly scoffing, contending, that for this cause cheefly these souldiers could not be recalled, because the Emperour had so many forces, that off necessitie he behoo∣ved, to disburden himselff off that army off arnheimbia, and therfore, he, not without cause, sent it to his frend the King of Pole, against Swethen; as the authentike letters doe yet shew; neyther would he again answere any thing els to any purpose, to the reiterated desires off the Ambassador; but caused the said army to hasten its iorney; which also, the whole last sommer, did vse such bitternes off fight in Prussia, against the King and Kingdom off Swethen; that, vules God, the Iust revenger off iniquitie, had made the recompence, off the attemps off their wicked intension to light vpon their owne heads, no small daunger was like to have happened, both to the most Illustrious King, and Kingdom off Swethen, and to all his Mas. Frends. Can any man doubt therfore any longer, whither the most Illustrious King off Swethen had sufficient cause, to move him, (all cogitations off peace laid aside) long agoe to have taken armes, and prepared himself for warre, for the defence, off him, and his. But there was yet one thing restand, which seemed yet a litle to hinder the speedy ta∣king off armes (to wit) the expectation of an answere to the Kings letters, from the Electorall convention, and the intervention off the most Illustrious King off Denmarck, who, at the perswasion off his Royall Ma. had from the last winter, even till now, begun to vrge the matter to trea∣ties: for certanly, so long as any sufficient reparation off dammages and iniuries, and provision for the securitie off his neighbours might be wrought by treatie, his Ma. was never so covetous off revenge, but that, for the zeale he bears to the common cause, and publict quietnes, he would willingly have suffered the matter to have bene en∣ded, rather by treatie, then arms.
But seing, that, from the beginning of Aprill, in this ye∣ar 1630. when there was a day appointed for a convention at Dantsik in Prussia, vnto this very month of Iune, there is no signification of treatie made, by the partie offender, to the Commissarie of the partie offended, there present, and declaring by letters to Dantsik, his readines and power to reate; how sincerely the publict peace is desired, it is easie hereby to be Iudged, especiallie seing, their scoffings, not only of former times, but also after they had dispatched their Commissaries to Dantsik (by possessing themselvs of all fortified places and passages in Pomer, and preparing them∣selves more eagerly to warr, then heretofore) doe plainly ad∣vertise, with what securitie, any confidence may be put in such like treaties. As for the Electorall convention; it might indeed have one much in that matter, and his Royal Ma. perswaded himself, it would so have done, if the States of the Empire, ad obtained the fredom of their auncient libertie, and if the ower of evel willers had not taken such root therein, that t seemed, to reiect all internall remedie. they of the con∣vention did also, in their answere (which was in the late month of Aprill conveighed to Stocholme) praise the pea∣ceable intentions, and proffered transaction of the most Il∣lustrious King of Swethen, offering Withall reciprocall frendschip on their part. but seing they did not so much as n a word, touch the remedies of the injuries done, which the Kings letters, did cheifly requires did they not leave it neces∣sarie for his Ma. to provide opportune remedies for himself. Wherfore seing so many, and waightie injuries ar really done to his Royall Ma. his letters intercepted, and opened: his subjects, servants and soudiers spoyled, and caried away into sclavery; trade, naturally common, interdicted; the pole, his Mas. enemy, so often disswaded from peace; and a reaso∣nable army led out into Prussia, for the ruinating of his Mas.
Kingdom off Swethen. again also not graunting the King off Swethen, so much, as safe passage, yea, his Frends, neigh∣bours, and kindred (for malice towards him) oppressed, spoi∣led off their dominions, and only not altogether extirpated, the suers for peace (contrary to the custome off barbarians) ignominiously rejected; and at last, a hostile army twice sent against his Ma. and that without any cause, or pretext? Doe not all these, yea each off them (by consent off all Nations, by perswasion off reason, nature it self instigating therto) deserve a most due revenge, except due reparation doe interceed. seing so many threatnings, so great preparations, so many divices, ar as yet manifested, to the reproach off all the balthike havens, and off the very sea it self, by which, all both designes, deeds and determinations, seem everie where, both by sea and land, to cōspire for his Mas. ruine? doe they not cast vpō him (though vwilling) the right of defence, that at least, according to the custome of warr, and by the law off all nations, he may procure the moderation off a bla∣meles protection? seing, he having tryed all the wayes off law, no more equitable remedies ar graunted? yea seing ho∣stilitie is everie where offered; doth not the verie law of na∣ture require, that force be repelled by force. Since therfore there rests no other meane to procure sa∣fetie, then that his Ma. according to God, doe help the secu∣ritie off himself and his, by armes; he thought good by the∣se, tot let the Christian wordle Iudge, by what merit of him∣self, and how sore against his will, he is redacted to these ex∣tremeties. it is true, the defence only of the citie of Stral∣sound, is pretended for the ambition of most avaricious men: but how they them selves, by inferring off so many former hostilities, and how, afterward (as it is said) love off the common securitie, and so many reasons, have provo∣ked his Royall Ma. these have expressed, to the good off the Roman Empire it self.
Iff at any other tyme, he had aided the enemies off the Emperour, or the Roman Empire, or made any leauge with their enimies against thē, or at least put any other advice or counsel in executiō to their prejudice; no man might won∣der at their diffidence, and retaliation of som kind of reven∣ge flowing from hence? Now, seing such hath alwayes be∣e the constancie off his peaceable determination, that he ath not only kept inviolated Freindship and neutralitie during all this German warr; but hath neither before, nor after the same, given any Iust pretext, of offence; he can ot, but, with most iust greeff complain before all the word∣e, off so great an indignitie. Wherfore, as his Royall Ma. doth ptotest, that these his rmes, ar not as yet prepared, to any prejudice off the Roman mpire (with which he hath no inimitie) but only to the rotection off himself, and his, vntil such time, as his Frends nd neighbours be put in the same cace, in the which all he neighbourhood, hath before this warr, peaceably flou∣rished so long time; and vntill cheifly the citie off Stral∣sound, the balthik sea, and the Kingdom of Swethen may promise vnto themselves heerafter, more certan securitie: so he maketh no doubt, but that the impartiall reader, or he verie safetie of Nations, will improve and detest so in∣quitable proceedings off the contrarie party, as they have eserved; and he doth certanly hope, that all equitable Ger∣mans and all the Christian wordle, will favour this his innocencie, and Iust cause of taking ar∣mes, aiming at the lawfull staying off so vnjust persecution. FINIS.
