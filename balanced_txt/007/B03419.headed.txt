The Fame, Wit, and glory of the VVest, Here in this Song shall fully be exprest. A Caveat for young men wherein they may behold, how a youngster gave away his Mistris and his Gold; And Maids likewise may here a lesson learn, wherein good from bad they may discern; Learn but this damsels, wit, and then youl finde, a way to fit all suters in their kind. To a pleasant new Tune, Called the glory of the West. A Faire and comly creature, as ere was fram'd by nature, Lived in the west and the glory of the same; Her maiden life and carriage, Vntill her day of marriage; I of it néeds must wright unto her lasting fame, Most galants did admire, her beauty with desire, To injoy her company. and her vertues for to try; But alas poore fooles their labour was in vain, the glory of the west, they never yet could stain; Your courting, and your complements she'd say, is not the way to win me, I longer mean to stay. Perhaps you may admire, and have a great desire, To know why she was call'd the glory of the west; then give but time and leasure, And to fulfill your pleasure; her vertues here shall fully be exprest, She was proper tall and comly, no parts about her homely, She had no rowling eye, nor never used uncivility, But an amoreus swéet and lovly piersing sight, her chéeks and her lips was pure red and white, Her other parts can better be exprest, by him that now injoyes the glory of the west. So rare she was and witty, they call'd her famous Betty; Not far from Bristow this gallant spark did live; her Father was a Cavalior, And lost his life in service there, her mother was grown poor, & no portion could her giv Which made those gallants think that she would soon yéeld up her honesty, Quoth they wée'll venture, her royall fort to enter, But all their time they spent, alas it was in vain, the glory of the west, they never yet could stain, Quoth she you are deceiv'd tis not my poverty, shall ever make' me yeeld to your uncivility. My vergins life ile keep quoth she, untill such time that man I see, VVhich I can affect and chase him for my mate; when that gallant once I find, That to vertues is inclin'd and I can but fancy him, I care not for estate; If a royall heart he bear, and can love a Cavelier; That same promise he must make, for my noble fathers sake, VVhich lost his life and fortunes in the field, and to no other side my maidenhead I'le yeeld, If that he be a Cavalier, tho he be neer so poor, I'le love him, I'le serve him, and honour him the more GIve eare and listen to my Song, and I shall tell you are be long, How she hath obtaind a husband to her mind; a usurer that liv'd hard by, Left his Son when he did dye, Great sums of money, with goods and land behind; That youngster hearing of this girle, vow'd if either gold or pearle, Would this damsels favour win, then he weigh dit not a pinne. Hang money quoth he, my Gold I will let flye, my father he is dead, I have enough lye by, A conceit I have now comes into my breast, which I hope shall obtain the glory of the west. A kinsman poor I have quoth he. shall make up this same match for me, And a hundred pounds on him I will bestow, he is a comly youth and young, And knows well how to use his tongue and he will obtain her for me I do know; So forth he set this youngster brave, with money and what else hee'd have, For to try his utmost skill, to obtain this maids good will; Spare not quoth he tis no matter what you spend, doe the best you can, and be faithfull to your friend; That I will sayes he, but mark now the Iest, he consened his kinsman of the glory of the west. When first he came unto this Maid, with courteous words he to her said, Faire damsell I must court you in my kinsmans name; his father being of his life bereft, Great means behind him he hath left, and now this youngster injoyeth all the same; Which on you he will bestow, if you please it shall be so; Sir you have spoke enough quoth she, he's but a foole I plainly see. Do you present his person, and let him kéep his Gold, now you have your answer, that Riddle pray unfold; Your Riddle faire Mistris. I quickly understand. my person and my service shall be at your command. This gallant damsell faire and bright, in whom so many took delight; With this prodigals kinsman was taken so in love, which when he did perceive and see, He slipt no opportunity, but couzened his cozen as afterwards did prove; Swéet heart quoth he I am poor indeed, which made me fearfull to pceed; But what I want in wealth faire maid, shall be in love and service piad; Speak no more quoth she, few words I like the best, if you can love a Cavalier, no more shall be exprest, Swéet soule saith he tis known both farre and néer, I have lost all I had, for being a Cavalier. These lovers being vnited, his kinsman was invited; Over to her house, and he thought to get the lasse, but sure a foole he needs must be, When once he did the Mistresse see; to marry with her maid as after comes to passe, Qouth she unto this prodigall, now you have obtained all; By your kinsmans meanes quoth she, pray sweet heart tell to me, VVhat you will bestow upon him for his pain, my maid he would marry if a portion he could gain; He hearing of her words, drew forth a purse of Gold. and said sweet heart content him as long as it will hold. Five hundred pound is in't sayes he, the rest I freely give to thee; A Ring likewise he bought her, and a fam one thing of you qaoth she I crave, Our loves so secret I would have; I would not have it blaz'd abroad about So for that time he went a way. untill the appointed marriage day; VVhere in private they did meet, at a Church in Bristow street; And there his kinsman served him like a clo the Mrs. wore the maids clothes, the ma The Mistresse had her Maiden bravely dres this foole he did take her for the glory of the They vales before their faces had, so eager was this simple lad; In all the haste he marri'd néeds must be which being done his kinsman led, His Mistresse and unto him sed, this maid you must give me which he di His Gold he freely gave away, and his Mistresse oo I say, But yet he had enough beside, his Ring his gown, likewise a bride; It was too much for such a foole as he, for to maintain a kinsman his luter for to be; The clown got the Bride that was so bravely but his kinsman bore away the glory of the So from the Church away they went, this clown at first was well cotent; Thinking he had married with the glory of the w so homewards then he went apace, He never look't upon her face, but took her for her Mistresse, she was bravely His kinsman and his pritty mate, went smiling after in conseit, Thinking what the foole would say, when their vales were tooke away, Tis no matter what he said, they had his money the maid and the gown, it séems fell to his lot; I ne'er before did hear of such a pretty Iest, as here was brought about by the Glory of the w Brave gallants went to meet her, and kindly they did greet her; But thinking to salute the glory of the west, they were struck with admiration, To see such alteration; but pluking off ther wales. they soon perceiv'd This youngster when he did behold, he had lost his Mistresse and his Gold; Faith I might a looke quoth he, before that I had leapt so free; But now the proverb you may plainly see, marriage and hanging goes by destiny; Thus unto you I freely have exprest, The wit and behaviour of the glory of the west, This Song a warning well may be, to young men when they do it see If once they goe a wooing not to trust another, and maids if they this Song will learn, Good from had they may discern, and this girls behaviour they may chuse above all oth This couple lives most brave they say, n Bristow at this present day; Ever since they did agree, both in peace and unity; She never yet would give him cause of strife, I doe wish that every man could say so by his wife; Young men and maids, this Song so the glory of the west now bids you London printed for R. Burton, at the Horse-shooe in Smithfield, 164
