A TRVE RELATION OF THAT VVHICH LATELY HAPNED TO the great Spanish Fleet, and Ga∣leons of Terra Firma in America. WITH Many strange Deliueries of Captaines, and Souldiers in the tempest, and other remark∣able Accidents, worthy the Obseruation. ALSO, A Catalogue of those persons of account, which cytner perished in this Tempest, or were mira∣culously preserued. Faithfully translated out of the Spanish Origi∣nall, as it is printed and published in Madrid, Se∣vil, Lishbone, and other places. LONDON Printed for Nathaniel Butter, Nicholas Bourne, and William Sheffard, 1623.
The Printer to the Reader. THis Spanish Originall com∣ming to my hands most op∣portunely, tooke the aduan∣tage of my liking it, and sud∣den apprehension, that it would please the Reader, whosoeuer: not so much because thereby is proposed a kinde of variety of Newes, as in that the glory of God is made apparant in his workes, and wonder∣full prouidence, that can preserue men out of raging seas, and afford his mercy when wee thinke that it is quite denied vs: And although I may incurre an imputation by leaning more to the true sense, then to the words, as they lye in order: yet I will be bold to say, that the sentences here extended, shall neither receiue exoticke interpretation, nor bee carryed with any wanton hand from the true meaning:
Be therefore thus fauourable I pray, to reade it without a strict comparison of the origi∣nall. and accept of an honest intent, that ay∣meth as much at the satisfaction of worthy deseruers, as any profit can arise out of so meane a worke.
A RELATION OF THE SVCCESSE of the Galeons, and the whole Fleet of Terra Firma. THe 22. of August, 1622, the whole Fleet of Terra Firma, (that is to say, such Ships of Spaine and Galeons belong∣ing to his Maiesty,  di∣spersed, or imploy in the se∣uerall Harbors or Ports of A∣merica, or, if you had rather, the West-Indies) assembled themselues and came to∣gether into the Port of Hauana, a place belike ap∣pointed, as a Rendezvous, whither the Nauy might repayre to make their returne home. Whereupon the Generall, or, as you please, the Admirall, on the 23 of August, by publique Proclamation commanded that euery ship should register the gold, siluer, bul∣lion, merchandise, and other moueables, into their bookes of account, or office of the Admiralty, be∣cause they had a purpose to put to Sea and set Sayle the 28 day.
But considering the small dispatch was made, and the multitude of businesse wherewith they were en∣cumbred, they cast many doubts of loosing at all, or putting from the harbour vntill the coniunction of the Moone was past, whose effects they expected the 5. of September: Whereupon the Marquesse Gouernour of Hauana and the Country, called a Councel, summoning the officers, and proposing to the assembly, what was most necessary and befitting to be done for the conueniency and security of the whole Nauy: so there came accordingly the land-Gouernor or Generall ouer the Souldiers, the Ad∣mirall of the Armado, the Captaine Generall of the Fleet, and his Admirall; the Superuisor or Treasu∣rer, the Captaines of the Souldiers, and the Pilots, who with one consent determined, that in regard this Coniunction in September did commonly in those parts bring clouds and obfuscation of ayre, which would not vanish without tempests, and tur∣bulent winds, it was a seasonable prouidence, and befitting the security of the Armado, to remaine quietly in harbour, vntill the foresaid Coniunction were elapsed, which no question the same night would manifest her operation to some purpose. Vpon this resolution they prepared themselues, and setled their affaires to tarry the times appoint∣ment, and then to set forward their pretended voy∣age. But that euening promised such faire weather, and a serene Element, with a pleasant and sociable gale of winde continuing two or three dayes toge∣ther, made them all repent, and wish they had taken hold of opportunity, and set forward their iourney,
which caused the Generall to consent to their im∣portunities, and associate them as I may say, in their hopes: insomuch, that after generall musters, on Sunday the 4 of September, by breake of day they weighed anchors, and hoysed their sayles, accom∣modating the ships out of harbour to the best pur∣pose. There were 28. ships with their Admi∣rall; 8. Galeons; 3. Pinaces; and other attendants, vpon the Fleet, with their consorts. They sayled forward very prosperously, and had a time of fayre expectation. But Munday approaching, which was the day of the Coniunction, the weather according to former coniecture seemed to change, and the winde comming to North-east raised both a care and a feare in the Admirall: Besides, the Galeons forecasting all the wayes to preuent subsequent mis∣chiefe, woond vp their maine sailes, and tyed them fast to their yards, and aduanced only their Missens, making vse of their Bosprels, and in a word put in practice all the meanes which art and industry could afford to scape the danger. But it should seeme, that tempests will haue their courses, and are inexorable: For the wind increased and so whistled, that it would not hearken to the whistling of the Mariners, the clouds thickned and ouer mantled the Horizon, and the ayre was so dark and formidable, that they could not discerne one ship from another; by which chance, or rather dis∣asterous mischance, ere it was full noone, the winds continuing, and as it were couenaning to perpe∣trate some outragiousnesse, all the Galeons were dis∣sipated and disseuered, and the most part of the Fleet
for their better passage went before the wind, and tooke a course to saue themselues as well as they could: In which violence they were driuen from one another, and the wind continued so impetuous, that it not onely vnloosed their tacklings and sayles, but brake asunder their fore-masts, and rent their maine yards in shiuers, so they had no shift but to beare no sayle at all, or crosse the wind as they could. But as waues roule after waues, one mischiefe fol∣lowes another: for presently the wind turned to the South, which although it gaue them leaue the bet∣ter to accommodate themselues, and endure the tempest, yet it brought raine, and the Sea wrought as high as it did before: then they seared another misfortune, to be thrust or hurried into some creeke or bay of the coast of Florida, which they much sus∣spected by the great and wonderfull haste they had made (for they commonly ranne fiue or sixe leagues euery glasse) and then there was no hope but either splitting on the sands, or perishing on the shore. This storme and fearfull tempest continued with all outragiousnesse vntill Tuesday following, then by breake of day they assumed comfort that all was not lost and cast away: for they discried some ships afarre off, who as it seemed determined to returne to the Port of Hauana, in which course such as had masts and sayles prepared themselues, and the rest that were bruised and broken, as farre as they could discerne one another, laboured to doe the like, and prosecute the same course.
They began to enter the harbor the 10. of Septemb. and continued till the 14. The Galeons which were saued were the first, and so other ships followed, af∣ter they had knowledge of one another. The same day ariued the Galeon S. Ann de Real, hauing lost her maine Maste: with her came Captain or Admirall Esteuan Delgado, whose ship was laden with the mer∣chandise of the said Port of Hauana, she entred in safety without any impeachment, or wrecke of the tempest. The 11. entred the Admirall of Terra firma, or the Continent, with the losse of her maine Maste: in her company was a ship of Cadiz, who sustained no de∣triment, but had all her masts and tacklings in order. The 13. ariued the Admirall of Manana, with all her Masts. The same day came the Admirall Reall, though somewhat late, hauing recouered 11 ships of of the Fleet, and certaine Pinaces, wherein were 50. persons of the bay of Tortuga, who liue vnder 25 de∣grees. This Admirall likewise escaped without losse of a tackling. Other ships which were not of the Fleet, came al∣so from the Ilands into the same harbor without impeachment, obseruing the time of happy and sea∣sonable departure from the North of S. Domingo.
What Galeons and Ships were lost, and peri∣shed in this tempest. 1 THe Admirall of the whole Fleete following the storme, and driuen by the winde with the fore-saile of the middlemost Maste, ran North∣ward all night and the next day; whereupon shee proposed to rest in some harbour, or place of secu∣ritie on those shores: but suddenly shee came to shallow water, and in short space ranne her selfe on ground at two fathome water and a little more, where her beake brake a pieces, with the losse of her people, except three men and two boyes: this was on the Coast of Maracumbe in Florida. 2 The Galcon Margerita followed the same course, and participated with the same fortune: For shee was lost the 8. day, comming to three fathome wa∣ter, but she was violently thrust on a flat or sand: so that the keele sticking fast with the gusts ouer-great, and the billowes extreamely raging, the body shiue∣red all to pieces, and the passengers when it was ap∣parant they could not escape, saw as little mercy in the Sea, as they had endured in the Winde. 3. and 4. In the same houre, with the same tem∣pest, and almost at the same place, two Ships of the Fleet were swallowed in the Sea, and perished be∣fore they could approach the shore: but yet Cap∣taine don Bernardine de Lugo was miraculously saued
on a piece of timber, though some say a broken hatch, which the Sea wasted toward the shore, and 60. persons or soldiours of his company escaped vp∣on diuers things, to the broken carkasse of the for∣mer Admirall, and so by degrees, made shift to saue their liues. 5 A Frigot, which came from Cartagena with Portugals was lost at Tortuga, in one of those dange∣rous Creekes, and vnknowne Promontories: there were in her 56. persons, who all escaped vpon seue∣rall chests and plankes. 6 The Admirall Th: de Luspam saued himselfe in a little shallop, which the Galeon drew after him: For when he saw no remedie, he cut off the rope, and with a conuenient number rowed aboue three leagues in the Sea, till at last they droue themselues into a streight, and so come ashore. 7 The Galeon of our Lady del Rosario, wherein Captaine Chacurretta was Commander, likewise pe∣rished, not without great suspition before hand: she rann aground, as the Admirall did, so that none of the Ships that came into the Harbour could giue an account of her, vntill a certaine Barke arriued the 22. of September at the Port of Hauana with Letters from the said Captaine, which aduertised them, that the said Galeon perished in Tortuga, all the company escaping miraculously, who had the fortune to saue themselues with conuenient victuall and necessary suppliments, keeping firme stations on their chests, masts, and such other things. 8. and 9. Moreouer two other ships were thought and adiudged lost, because they were not heard of af∣ter
the storme. But if you will be acquainted with a wonder indeed. The Pilot of the Margarita was mi∣raculously saued vpon the rib of a ship, on which he was caried fiue daies together in the Sea, and sustai∣ned his life by a bird, or reasonable bigge foule which came to his hand, vntill a Pinace passing by him in a most seasonable time, tooke him in and brought him to safe Harbour.

So that there were 462. persons, as you may perceiue and vnderstand by this Relation, of seamen, souldiers and passengers, who embarked themselues in these two Ga∣leons, that is to say, the Admirall of the Fleet, called our Lady of Atocha, and the S. Margarite, which (as some will haue it) signifies the ship of pearle, amongst whom perished 391. and 71. were saued, as is by the same ap∣parant. Concerning the rest, I finde no other mention in the originall, but what is briefly handled before: only the Author falls to some businesse, wherein they were im∣ployed after the storme, which accordingly I thus prose∣cute, not varying from the true meaning of the same. The 25. of September 1622. the great Marquesse afore∣named, Gouernour of Hauana, assembled once againe a Councell, to which all the Officers were summoned, about the returne into Spaine with the rest of the Fleet, concluding to depart after the coniunction of October, to which it should seeme they all condescended, except the Generall Iohn de Sara moran, the Admirall Thomas de la ray pura, and two principall Pilots of the Armado, or the whole Fleet, with the Pilot of the Admirall, who for diuers reasons, besides the great prouision and treasure in the same, did not thinke it fit or conuenient in so dan∣gerous a time, and after so fearfull a warning, to aduen∣ture so great a substance and so rich a prize into the hands of fortune, wind or weather; but rather to returne into Spaine at the Spring of the yeare, and make vse of a more prosperous season: to which aduice (as it should seeme) this Nauall Councell subscribed. The eighteenth of September there departed from the
Port of Hauana three Barkes or Frigots, vnder the com∣mand of Captaine or Admirall Gaspar de Vargaz, whose charge was to search for the Artillery and treasure of the lost Galeons: and on Monday the 28. of Septem∣ber, after safe arriuall, they there summoned all the soul∣diers, sea-men and passengers, who were miraculously pre∣serued in the tempest, when the said Admirall was lost vn∣der the command of Michael de Cazaretta, and whom at their comming in Florida they found in safetie, and with whom the said Gaspar de Vargas returned after they had dis∣couered where the Admirall lay, which they might doe by the top-mast appearing aboue water, and so very fortu∣nately they dispatched their vnfortunate businesse. They diuided into these Frigots or small Barkes, the most part of the Artillery or Ordnance, which with great labour and industrie they got out of the Galeons, begin∣ning first with her that perished in the Bay of Tortaga, but they were much troubled and encombred with two speci∣all peeces, which put them to excessiue oile. Thus were they able in respect of the Fortresse of Tabaco to search further, and at conuenient leasure to effect that, which they came about: for this Fort being built and erected of purpose to keepe the inhabitants in awe, and debar stran∣gers from any intrusion, as also to accommodate them, if by disastrous chance they should be driuen into these pla∣ces, so watched the two perished Galeons, that they found what was to be found vntouched: whereupon the said Gaspar de Vargas writ of his successe to the Marquesse, and of the toile he sustained in the Margarite, with other ad∣uentures, as the danger and wonderfull paines which the Diuers endured, and the Sailers proued, euen when they
were in the waste of the lost ships, whose bodies were bro∣ken to peeces, and lay in a manner vnder water. When this was done, and that they could finde or re∣couer no more, at a quiet and a still water, in the company of Captaine Cazaretta they searched the Creeke, and the Bottome more narrowly for the bullion and treasure of the said Galleon of Rosario, and had the fortune to finde the most part of it, though it seemed smoked, blacked, and impeached with the owse and frettings of the water, yea after foure naturall daies they drew it all out with the losse onely of one Ingot. The next worke in the harbour of Hauana, was the Currying and trimming such ships as had escaped the tempest, whereupon to be more able to furnish the three distressed Galeons that came Mastlesse into the harbor (as you haue heard) they cast a crosse a ship of Cadiz, and disrobed her, as I may say, taking her Masts, Tackling and furniture, whereby they supplied many wants, and as well as they could, masted the Galeons againe, so that they were thought fit and seruiceable to prosecute the voyage of the sea, when occasion should inuite them to returne into Spaine. The fourth of October, there came into the Port of Hauana, a certaine Frigot with twentie persons, and two Friars Vittorians, who saued themselues in a ship of new Cumpechana in the first voyage, when they accompanied the Fleet of new Spaine, and were cast a shore on the rockes, and Ilands of Bermuda, hauing beene hurried and tossed two daies together with a strange storme and won∣derfull tempest, and yet the Galeons and most of their Fleet were saued, God be thanked, onely some ships pe∣rished,
amongst whom was theirs in which they first im∣barked themselues; so that there were drowned 83 per∣sons, who could by no meanes be prouided for, because one morning very early all the ship was couered with water and ready to sinke, whereupon the better sort procured to get into the boat, which with much adoe they effected, affoording leaue to none to enter but themselues, lest they should all perish, and so better saue some. They which went vp prouided one great basket of bisket, and a little fresh water, wherewith they sustained themselues, vntill they came into the har∣bour of Hauana 26. daies after their Nauigation, by which occasion many haue reported, that they had no other shallop, but the boat of the ship. The 24. of October being Sunday, the Marquesse cal∣led a Councell againe for the concurrency of al businesse, wherein it was propounded to acquaint his Maiesty by some pinnesse or other aduenturer, with their present af∣faires, and so to prouide for the furnishing of the other ships for new Spaine, and if Captaine Gasparo de Veruas returned in the meane while, then might the occurrences and particulars of the scarches of the lost Admirall and Galeon of Saint Margarite be aduertised all together, ac∣cording to the agreement of the court and assembly. The second of Nouember died the Generall of the fleet, Iohn de Lara Moran of a Calenture, which ouer ma∣stred him. Don Pedro de Vrsula, was also sent into Florida, to make further search in the Margarite and Admirall, for treasure and other things, while Captaine Gaspar de Vargas went to prouide especiall necessaries: but no man was permit∣ted
to search the sides of the broken ships, which by this time were come to the shore, but the licensed Offi∣cers. The 18. of Nouember Don Peter Vrsula, arriued at the Creeks, where the Galeons were lost, and began his aduen∣ture for the finding of more treasure, God grant a good successe may crowne his seruice. FINIS.
