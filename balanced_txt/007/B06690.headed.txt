The Womens just Complaint: OR, Mans Deceitfulness in Love. Being a most Pleasant New Play-house Song. Long time deceiv'd with feigned Vows, at last, The Females find their Coyness holds not fast; For Man, that Noble Creature, cannot Love, Nor fix his Soul on ought but what's above: 'Tis Everlasting joy he Centers on, And leaves soft Fools, Women to dote upon; Which once they finding, seem to loose their Care Of hopes they had, and fall to flat dispair. To a pleasant New play-house Tune, much in request. O Love thou art a Treasure, could Constancy remain, But for an hour of Pleasure, we feel an Age of Pain: How eager is the Lover. But when his Ioys are over, Poor Women do discover, the vow of Men are vain: Poor Women, &c. In vain are all their Swearings, 'tis but your Love to gain, In vain their promis'd Fairings, their Lusts for to obtain: Teir Cringing and ther Bowing, Is worse ten Thee and Thouing, Poor Women find the Vowing of men, is all but vain: Poor Women, &c. In vn their mean and Carriage, their promis'd Love they feign, In vain they promise Marriage, maids honours for to stain: In vain their Songs and Dances, Plays Masquerades Romances, Poor Women find the Fancies, and vows of men are vain: poor Women, &c.
All Wedlock tyes Defieing, when once their Wills they gain, Scoffing at, or denying, what once did cause their pain: When with a thousand Kisses, And with as many Wishes, Poor Women they with blisses, deceiv'd, which vows are vain: Poor women, &c. And whosoe're believes them, they snare them 'tis most plain, And when they'r took, deceive them, and leave them to complain: Whilst we poor Fools at Mourning, They our Griefs are scorning, Poor Women then take warning, for men are false and vain: Poor Women, &c. They breath false sighs to win us, and Counterfeit Loves pain, And into Bonds they bring us, with Flatteries so vain. By praising of our beauties; And Swearing 'tis their Duties, Poor Woman while she mute is, but find at last all vain: Poor woman, &c. Much like to Airy Vapours, are all the Vows they feign, Or like Expiring Tapours, that ne'r will burn again: But leave us in deep Sorrow, For joys we did but borrow, Poor Women bid Good-morrow, and leave us to Complain: Poor Women, &c. 'Tis sure the God of Lovers, made not his Laws in vain, He better joys discovers, and makes his precepts plain: Why them should man delude us, When he has so Judas'd us, Poor Women why be screw'd thus, on things we can't obtain: Poor women, &c. Let us then be contented, let Lordly still remain, For him he was invented, let us not wish in vain: For what though we endeavour, Yet can deserve him never, Poor Women wishing ever, yet all our wishes vain: Poor women, &c. Then let us be contented, and strive no more with pain, Least we at last repent it, and past all hopes, Complain: When there is no Relieving But still we must be grieving Poor Women, by deceiving, men shew their vows are vain: Poor Women, &c.
