❧ By the Queene. A Proclamation for the dearth of Corne. THE Queenes Maiestie hearing by report out of sundry Countries in the Realme, or the vnreasonable encrease of prices of Graine, to the griefe of her poorer sort of people that haue no liuing by Cillage: And though the sellers of Corne, as rich Farmers, and Ingrossers, do pretend to raise the prices by colour of the vnseasonablenesse of this Sommer: yet that being no rust cause to raise the prices of their olde Corne of the last yeeres growth, but that the Farmers and Ingrossers of Corne, of meere couetousnesse haue ve∣ry lately, euen within two moneths, most vncharitably haunced vp their prices, not collerable to be suffered. For remedie whereof, to the reliefe of the great multitude of her poore louing Subiects, lacking Corne for their foode, and also for reformation of ma∣ny other abuses committed by such couetous and vncharitable persons, being voide of all naturall compas∣sion towards their neighbours: Her Maiestie calling to her remembrance the good orders by her Maiesties commaundement published the last yeere, especially for the staye of the dearth of Corne, to be executed by the Sherifes and Iustices of Peace in euery Countie of her Realme, the good obseruation whereof would re∣medie these disorders of the yll and wealthy sort, and to the reliefe of the good and needie: Doeth therefore charge and straightly commaund all her Sherifes and Iustices of Peace, and other principall Officers in Townes Corporate, foorthwith vpon publication hereof to assemble themselues in their places accustomed, and there diligently to peruse the said Orders published in the yeere of our Lord, one thousand fiue hundred fourescore and fifteene, and diligently to consider all such points of those Orders, as may tend to the refor∣mation of all persons, that by their disorder and couetousnesse, and breach of the said Orders, are the causers directly or indirectly to encrease the prices of Graine in this lamentable sort beyond reason, and foorthwith to proceede to the execution of all such orders, as may with good reason giue remedy to the furniture of Mar∣kets, and to abate such vnreasonable encrease of prices. And of their doings her Maiestie commandeth that the saide Sherifes and Iustices, and other principall Officers, doe certifie her Maiesties priuie Counsell monthly, or oftner, vntill the last of December next, with particular notifications of such Iustices & Offi∣cers as shall herein bestowe their labours, so as her Maiestie by such certificate may be duely informed, who they are that shall duetifully towards her Maiestie, and charitably towards their neighbours, perfourme their charge committed to them, and contrariwise to mislike of such as shall neglect the execution of this her commaundement. And in like maner, her Maiestie being informed of an abuse greatly tending to make a scarcitie of Corne meet to make bread, by making of Starch within the Realme, of Corne of the Realme, doeth streightly com∣maund, that no maner of person shal make any Starch of any Corne, or branne of Corne growen within the Realme, or that is, or shall be brought into the Realme, nor wittingly sell or vtter any such Starch (except such as hath bene made by vertue of her Maiesties Letters Patents.) And whereas her Maiestie hath al∣ready, by her saide Letters Patents graunted to one of her louing Subiects, the making of Starch to bee made of Bran only: To the end, the poorer sort may be relieued this way also, Her Maiestie doth also streight∣ly inhibite and forbidde the said Patentee, his Deputies and Assignes, and euery of them, (notwithstanding her Maiesties graunt by the saide Letters Patents) hencefoorth to make any Starch of Branne, during this time of dearth, vpon paine of imprisonment by any Iustice of Peace, or other publike Officer of iustice, and forfeiture to her Maiesties vse of the same Starch so made, either of Corne or Branne, or any other Graine, or wittingly put to sale by the said Patentee, his said Deputies or Assignes, or by any other person or persons whatsoeuer. Giuen vnder our Signet. At our Mannor of Greenwich, the last day of Iuly, in the xxxviii. yeere of our Raigne. God saue the Queene. Imprinted at London by the Deputies of CHRISTOPHER BARKER, Printer to the Queenes most excellent Maiestie. 1596.
