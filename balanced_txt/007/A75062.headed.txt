A. In two principal mysteri namely, the Ʋnity and Trinity  God, the Incarnation, and De of our Saviour. Q. What means the Unity  Trinity of God? A. It means, that in God the is but one only Divine Natu though there be three Persons,  Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Q. Why are there but three P¦sons only? A. Because the Father hath  beginning, and proceedeth f no other Person, the Son proce¦eth from the Father, the  Ghost proceedeth from the F and the Son, and more proce in God, there cannot be. Q.

same Goodness, one and the same Wisdom. Q. What means the Incarnation and Death of our Saviour? A.

In the sign of the Cross, as it is made by Catholicks. Q. How shew you that? A. Because when we put our right hand to our head, saying: In the name, we signifie one God, and when we make the sign of the Cross, saying, Of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, A∣men; we signifie Trinity, or three Persons. Q. How does the sign of the Cross represent the Incarnation and Death of our Saviour?
A. By putting us in mind that he was made man to die upon the Cross for us. CHAP. II. Faith expounded. Q. WHat is Faith? A. It is the gift of God infus'd into our Souls, by which we firmly believe all those things, which God hath any way revealed to us. Q. Why must we firmly believe a matters of Faith? A. Because God hath taught them, who neither can deceive, not be deceived. Q. How are you sure that God hath taught them all?
A. By the testimony of the ho∣ly Catholick Church. Q. It is enough to believe all that is written in the Bible? A. No, it is not, for we must also believe the Creed, and Apo∣stolick Traditions, which are not there. Q. What Faith will suffice to save a man? A. Faith working by charity, Galat. chap. 5. ver. 6. Q.

of truth, 1 Tim. 3. nor can she erre in Faith. Q. Why may not a well-meaning man be saved in any Church, or Re∣ligion? A. Because there is but one Lord, one Faith, one Baptism, the 4th. to Ephes. 5.

They mean, that God is our Father by Creation & Adoption al∣so, if we be in state of grace; and therefore we may boldly come to beg all blessings of him.
Q. Why, Our Father, and not my Father? A. Because God is the common Father of all, and all good Christi∣as must pray for one another. Q. What understand you by which art in Heaven? A.
