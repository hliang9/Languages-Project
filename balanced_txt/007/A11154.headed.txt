A Search for Money. Or The lamentable complaint for the losse of the wandring Knight, Mounsieur l'Argent. Or Come along with me, I know thou louest Money. Dedicated to all those that lack Money. Frange nucis tegmen, si cupis esse nucem. By William Rowley. Imprinted at London for Ioseph Hunt, and are to be solde at Newgate Market, neere Christ Church gate. 1609.
To his entire and deare-esteemed friend, Maister Thomas Hobbs. Health on earth Temporall, and higher happinesse eternall. IT is but a toy (deare friend) that I present you with, but if you accept it not, I shall lay the prouerbe to your charge, (qui parnum contemnit, indig∣nus est magno) hee that refu∣seth a little kindnesse, is vn∣worthy of a greater, but I question it not, nor would I haue you ouer affect it for the title sake, for that it is a Searcher of Money: perhaps you would haue beene willingly one of this inquisition, but you shall not neede, onely ouer-view this, and take my opinion, where he is, and that is, where I trust you shall ne∣uer goe to seeke him. I would define to you these two prepositions, of and in, that you are in the world (though you must out of it) 'tis certeine, but be not of the world, (though you beare earth about yee,) for then you are a wordling, and haue affinitie with Money, whose best part is but earth, whose (too much worshipt greatnesse) in my iudgment is
but as a bare-legd passage through many acres of briers, for a handfull of rushes on the other side, (being found, not worth halfe the toile) but vse his companie as I do, and that's as I weare my gloues some-time on, some-time of, and many times leese them quite, take this, to refuse it: the next search I make (God willing) shall bee for wisdome, and then if you will go along with me, weele pace together: till then, Farewell. Yours, William Rowley.
To all those that lack money. GEntlemen, for so much you may be that want money, and more they cannot bee that haue it, (bee that your comfort,) Yee are indeed the onelie Maecenas∣ses and Patrons of Poesie, for to your weake purses there are alwaies ioy∣ned willing hearts, and (if not deedes) at the least, good wordes, (Similis simili gaudet) I ioye (most respected benefactors) in your fellowshippe, for from me yee are like to receiue nothing but good words, will yee now vndertake an equall trauell with me (I know not yet whither) and let the destinies (if they will) re∣ward our paines. I knowe the walkes in Paules are stale to yee, yee could tell extemporally I am sure howe many paces t'were betweene the quire and the West dore, or (like a Suffolke man) answere at the second question, dead sure: there hath beene (many of yee) seene measur∣ing the Longitude and Latitude of More-fields any time this two yeares and vpwards (all but in the hard season of the great frost) and then yee slid away the time vpon the Thames, yee haue beene either eare-or-eye-witnesses or both to many madde voiages
made of late yeares, both by sea and land, as the trauell to Rome with the returne in certaine daies, the wild mo∣rise to Norrige, the fellowes going back-ward to Bar∣wick, another hopping from Yorke to London, and the transforming of the top of Paules into a stable, to these and many more, ad one more, what oddes with him now that will bring yee to the place where your lost and long wisht friend Mounsier Money is within two houres? me thinkes yee smile now? but you would laugh if it were so indeede, you thinke it not possible now, You hauing searcht so diligentlie and are yet without him, but pluck vp a good hart, hire but this hackney and (vita pro vita) hee will bring yee to the place for the prise of a peck of oates, tis no great charge, along with him but pace him not too fast for feare of stumbling, if yee dislike this voi∣age, returne to my stable againe, if I horse yee not for better profit, turne from a Gentile to a Iew & spit at me, there has beene time and labor (a lit∣tle of both) to bring him to this small groweth. Vale. frustra nihil. Your ioynt friend in estate. VVILLIAM ROVVLEY.
A search for Money. COme my maisters, all you that will bee of this priuie search to finde this wan∣dring Knight, (Mounsieur Money) lay by your armes, and take your leggs and follow me. Stay, stay, stay, come not so fast: I call not all those that would find him, (there would be left then scarce so many behinde as there was vndrown'd at the deluge) but some of those as are fittest and most at leisure to search, as some score of idle souldiers, these are men that are experi∣enc't to walke the round, for walke yée must resolue ere yée finde him, he shifts his lodging so oft, or else he lyes so obscure he wil hardly be spoke with. Wel, I doubt not but yée will bee painfull in the quest, onely your censures which way first to begin as the likelyest to finde the nea∣rest way (being the very Nominatiue case first to finde the construction) and then haue with ée: lets first question his descent: faith from earth (of our orne kindred,) I would he were not so néere to vs in kindred, then sure he would be néerer in kindnesse, and then we must conclude (comming from earth) that thither he must returne, and therefore is now on earth. There may a doubt arise from hence too, for being here cannized, na Deified and made a God, (for therein we must néeds confesse our impure idolatr) it may be he has tane his glorious flight to heauen already. That cannot bee neither, sure Peter has bard the gates against him, for hee that would not sell heauen to Monie on earth, 'tis most likely he will not sell heauen, now once possest of
it, thinke yee then he hangs (like a defected spirit) in the ayre, no hee is too massie, or if he were, wee haue Danaes inough to bring him showring downe: in the fire thinke yee neither, I know them that haue runne through fire and water too, and yet haue not found him: the sea is lunatique too, and mad folkes keepes no money, he would sinke if he were there: is he damnd by the curses of the poore, and so gone to hell; if hee bee, weele rake hell but weele finde him, no, the Diuell builds (they say) to enlarge his kingdome, and builders commonly are without mo∣ney, well, then wee must returne to our first proposition, that hee bides in his first element, thats earth, conclude there to search for him then, set up the staffe which way to begin, & conuenimus omnes, 'tis falne to the Cittie, a hopefull way a first: enter the gates before there be any opposition: haue with yee. Let us be carefull in our inquisition, omit no (halfe sus∣pected) place, therefore let vs enquire at the Tailors shop (for that stood next the gate) if the beloued Mounsieur Mo∣ney had not there taken vp his lodging, the brauerie of the time makes a suspect, therefore enquire of him. The moti∣on was no sooner made to two or three crosse-legd iorney men, but they swore by the bread they then eate (and they seemd to relish their oathes with a good stomacke too) that there he was not, there hee should haue beene indeed, and many bills of authoritie they had sent forth to fetch him, but come hee would not, nor could they tell where he lay. Well on we goe, the next enquirie we made at a painted lattice, hauing (as we supposd) some hope there to finde him, but alas, nihil ad propositum as wee found the se∣quell, we beldiv (and officers like) enterd the house, where wee spyed a more lamentable spectacle then Amintas mourning for his Phillis: An olde woman (being the sicke minded hostesse) deiected and throwne into such a per∣plexitie, as you would haue thought her owne traiterous hes would haue blowne her vp, her hand (like a despai∣ring
louer) boulstering her cheeke, yet with a saint interga∣torie, she askt vs what wee lackt? wee tolde her Money, shee some-thing gathering her womanish spirits about her, told vs hastily, that she had paid her Brewer a month agoe, and that we did her wrong to demand it. But vpon our further and well considerd replye, shee was satisfied, that we came about no such matter, onely to know if such a traueller lay in her house, then with a sorrowfull shak∣ing of her head, her griefe was redoubled, oh no, oh no, oh no, thrise as if shee would haue coniured him thether presently, and began to plant her face for a most passio∣nate reply. You sée this roome here I haue others well and thriftily furnisht with houshold-stuffe, but in this is containd my whole sustance, which ere we goe any fur∣ther you shall heare describ'd. The battlements which had beene whit and innocent, were now sullied with vn∣capable caracters of (as I may so terme it) Candle-gra∣phie, all the sides both walles and posts showed like a fir∣mament without a sunne, all full of pale and sickly prode∣gies, which shee with a heart as colde as Aeneas recount∣ing the tale of Troy, in this manner vnfolded to vs: these longer sort (quoth the) which stood like white streamers, are the least harmful portraiting (as it were) but euen penny-worths of mishaps, these other demi-lunes or halfe Moones, and with that she vented another volley of sighes which are thrise double the mischiefe of the rest, but these round ones (quoth shee) like full Moones, (and indeed, not altogether vneffectuall) for then twas full sea, and the water stretcht a little beyond her bounds, from forth the hollow caues of her eyes issued fountaines, which walking downe the furrowed pathes of her face, and venteroustie meaning (as it were) to passe the gulfe of her mouth in quietnesse, bound her tongue for a ceraine space to peace, which afterward being releast, shee went forwarde to tell vs a strange Metamorphosis, and one indeede that Ouid had quite forgotten, how that all her
Ale was transform'd into those fatall meteors, which was indeede Chalke, 'twas strange, but not so strange as true, Money sayes shee was eyther sledde or a sleepe, for he was not stirring: shee added with all the report of her better fortunes, how shee had a swifter and more profitable mu∣tation of her Ale in former time, how that first her Ale was Ale, and then it was Langtoe, and then it was Ale againe: wee were presently (at the hearing of this) impor∣tunate, to haue the morrall of this misterie, what this Langtoe was? faith saith shee, the English phrase is a lit∣tle too broad, and comparisons are odious, else I would tell you by the way of comparison, but (a little corrupt∣ing the word) shee would tell vs by a simile, for euen as the Salt-sea-water being taken out of the Sea, and purg'd in the clouds and ayre, yet at length returnes to sea againe, and becomes perfect Sea-water againe: so Ale though kept a while in the clouds of the body, yet may againe perfectly and prouidently returne to the fatte, and so re-returne to the body, as yee may obserue in the course of things, how grasse turnes to hay, and the seedes of have make grasse againe. At this wee were all rew∣matique, and spit at the apprehension of it, concluded and folde her plainly, that we could not pittie her, for we did imagine she had poison'd her guests, and they in due re∣uenge had chok't her, fed quid hoc ad nos: what's this to our purpose? this is the generall folly of the time, when we are once got into an Ale-house, we neuer finde the way out againe: but on, on, what if we enquir'd at the Shoo∣makers ouer the way? wee did, but in vaine, the maister himselfe was not within, and all the rest lay sicke of Mer∣curies boone, (cruell Mercurie to deale so with good fel∣lowes,) yet they were labouring their hides, and singing like carelesse trauellers coram latrone: as wee were but asking the question steps mee from ouer the way (ouer∣listning vs) a news-searcher, viz a Barbar, he hoping to at∣tains some discourse for his next patient left his banner
of basons swinging in the ayre; and closely eaue-drops our conference, the saucie treble-tongu'd knaue would in∣sert some-what of his knowledge, (treble tongu'd I call him, and thus I prooue't, hee has a reasonable Mother tongue▪ hs Barber-surgions tongue, and a tongue be∣tweene two of his fingers, and from thence proceeds his wit, and tis a snapping wit too,) well sir, he (before he was askt the question) told vs, that the wandring knight sure was not farre off, for on Saterday-night hee was faine to watch till morning, to trim some of his followers, and its morning they went away from him betimes: hee swore he neuer closd his eyes till hee came to Church, and then he slept all Sermon time, but certainely hee is not farre afore, and at yonder Lauerne (showing vs the bush) I doe imagine he has tane a chamber, we went some-what hope∣full now, hauing so faire a likelihood: Thither wee came, where at the entrie wee care a confused noise (like a blacke Sanctus, or a house haunted with spirits, such hol∣lowing, shouting, dauncing and clinking of pots, that sure now we suppos'd wee had found, for all th's reuelling could not be without Mounsieur Mony had beene on of he crew, we had the salute (of welcome gentlemen) present∣ly, wilt please yee see a chamber, it was our pleasure (as wee answered the apron-man) to see, or be very neare the roome where all that noise was, we were admitted and vsherd presently into a neighbor Chamber, where by the nt obseruance both of our eyes and eares, we might be aquainted who they were, whom when we had wel ouer∣viewed, wee might truely perceiue there was no such man there as Mounsieur Mony,  that you may the better beleeue vs, oele describe the assēbly: there was (to begin with the worthiest) two or three of our own faculty & fami∣liar acquaintance, swaggering souldiers: A pair (amongst many) of thred-bare Poets, men that want mony more then wit, foure or fiue flag-falne Plaiers, poore harmelesse merrie knaues, that were now neither Lords nor Ladies,
but honestly wore their owne cloathes (if they were pale for), amongst these were two or three gun-makers, & they lookt like an Almanack dated in eighty eight, and toward the lower end of the table, which indeed we could well distinguish by neither bread nor salt, for there was nei∣ther, except two or three small biskets, which (I dare say) nere a souldier there durst venter to breake,) but by the condition of the men wes gest it so, (who were indeed a noise of musitions) those that I haue seene at the tables side (for manners sake) scraping manibus pedibusque, yet now admitted a place at table, and good reason too at this time, (as you shall vnderstand) the reckoning was cald for and within a while brought in, a mist then (with two pipes of Tobacco) was cast before our eyes, but we perceiued how it went, fire shillings dropt from the consort at lower end, which God wot, they had that morning scrapt out at an Embassadors window, little els was visible, onelie some of them whispered the drawer in the care (but hung neere a Jewell in it) he shooke his head and went a∣way, three partes discontent yet faintlie pronounst, yee are welcome Gentlemen: vpon this the companie de∣parted. Wee thought wee had staied too long, for wee might sweare he that we sought for was not there, we sent one backe to the Barbar to tell him he was an asse to gesse so like a foole, and on we trauaile, we had not measured three cinque paces, but we met with one that came a far grea∣ter pace towards vs, and had now reacht vs, a gallant (as we tearme them) who (as we afterwards vnderstood) had narrowlie escaped the hands of a shoulderclapper, we spur'd our question to him, who pantingly, yet out of breath, swore as God indge him he had not seene him this fort-night, but seeke him and finde him bee must, or it would goe worse with him, we requested his company, he told vs that may wee went hee durst not returne, nor did he thinke hee lay that way, for the last time he parted and
shooke hands with him was in the suburbes, and if thi∣ther we would walke with him, he would bring vs to the house where hee left him, wee loath to leese any hope a∣greed, and went with him, he brought vs to a house where at the very entrance I did distrust we were yet mistaken, there was but three roomes, one crowning still the toppe of the other, and little bigger then so many of Diogenes his tubs, where two could scarcely be at ouce, but one must be on the top of the other, other countries (for they are common in all countries) call these mansions. Bordel∣loes, or Biothells, but in our familliar phrase it is common∣ly cald a house of iniquity, or some-time a subaudi domus, our conducter was but setting his foote ouer the thre∣shold but hee was repulst by head and shoulders by an old Laplander and her mate, with a face like a leane tripe vn∣washt, but behinde her stood trembling, two or three of Ve∣nus her Nimphes very prompt and seruiceable which the Beldams stood garding like the fire-spitting Fulles that garded the Colchos fleece, bellowing, roring and railng against our leader, that hee had carried her bst retainer, nay her verie maintainer from her house (Mounsier Mo∣ney) and vnlesse hee wnt and brought him along with him, hee should haue no entrance there, and so doing, hee should be as welcome as euer he was, hee swore as before hee had done that there he left him, and saw him not since, she vied and revied othes to the contrary that it was not so. This matter could not be decided, till one of our com∣pany, (hauing before been somewhat familliar with one of the Nimphes) had priuately enquired if hee were there or no, she had swore to him that hee had not beene thre since the Learme, and then that Gentleman had left him there, marry it was more then her old patronesse knew of, shee kept him obscurelie a while, but not long, and from thence hee went to the Doctors, where shee thought hee yet was, wee considering the circumstance thought it not
vnlikely, and went to pursue him this way, this was a good sent, and we were loath to loose it, well towards the ountebanke Doctor wée go, and at length there we ar∣riue, where we finde him, turning ouer his Stale bookes, and poring in his prospectiue, some-times graueld in the grauell, some-time sweating, and chasing to find whether were a burning feauer or no: him at his conuenient lei∣sure we gréeted, who very reuerent and courteously re∣saluted vs, thinking by our meager lookes we had béene some patients, but alas our disease was such as he had no phisique to cure, we propounded our former inquisition to know if such a gentleman lay not in his house, he present∣ly tied his reuerence to an oth that there he was not: hee had deferu'd (hée sayd) to haue his companie, but could not obtaine it, and for his vnkindnesse he wisht the yor or some other villanous disease would catch him, and then hée should bée sure of his company for a month or so (if no lon∣ger) till he were recouered againe, well (after the cere∣mony of departing) wée had our answere and away wee went: wée had no sooner descended the staires but at the doore, wée examined a paire of Porters, (mn of great carriage) yet hauing no such burdens lying on their necke, they both answered (vna voce) that they were now come out of the City and had bin there to séeke him, but could not finde him, nor did they thinke that hée was there, but rather that hée was ridde into the countrie this hard yeare to buy wheate, and meant to turne Far∣mer: this replie did on the suddaine astonish vs which way to turne, but béeing now in the Cittie we conclu∣ded (sit fas aut nefas) to end our enquirie there ere wée past it, and at the instant (as wée were againe entring) wee spied a streete on the left hand (the verie hand that ell standes on,) al adorned like a most famous infamous wardrope, for there were exe∣cuted and hung, (some by the necke, some by the heeles) many innocent garments, whose st owners themselues
were hung (most of them) on the other side of the Citty, and now the garments (for their maisters crime) suffered the second place of paine, and were there tortur'd to bée purged in the ayre of some infections that yet either ru or crept vpon them, we did immagine that our lost Moun∣sier had been there at the receit thereof, but sure he would not lodge nor abide amongst such a tribe of Iewish bro∣kers, yet hauing opportunity to aske, for then met vs one that had newly ransomed a long executed sute, and had of purpose chose it to sée if it could conduct him the same way the former owner was gone. (For indeed he meant to weare it to the proofe.) of him we askt who might bee the patron and furnisher of this large wardrope, he answered vs that the furnisher of that place was as mad a hang∣man as any was about the towne, nay there was none like him, his name was Don Carnifexius Crackonecko Dericko, a rare fellow (for there was none such) and it was doubt∣full whether he were a magician or no, for he vsed to ride in the ayre of Pacolets wooden horse, marrie hee was a clowne in one thing, he neuer ridde with bridle, but a base∣halter alwaies, and that was but  shew hée could raine his mare without a bit, and a mare it was by approbati∣on, for thée cast many colts, and that was with his vnmer∣cifull backing of her so néere her téeming time, nay (saies hée) hée is a very Alexander for none but himselfe dares mount his Bucephalus, but is in daunger of death ere hée comes to the ground, nay his owne seruant (by credible report) that had well broke and often managed her, for offering to get vppe the wrong way, was throwne and broke his neck. This merry description made vs léese a little time, yet now wée were sated with this (hauing other businesse in hand) therefore we (some-what vnmannerly) tooke his tale out of his mouth, and desired him (for hasts sake) to tell vs if such a lost gentleman as we sought might not bée found in that lane, (nodum in scirpo querimus) hée durst sweare
and did sweare without any further premeditation that there hee could not possibly bee, for all that pendant trea∣sury that wée saw, were but baites allure him thither, yet all and more not sufficent to bring him, therefore returne if yée be wise, you fall into the ditch els, and enter the Cit∣tie againe, for if there hee be not, he is a verie extrauagant and has no abiding, this counsell wée once againe accepted and againe we enter the gates, where we found much ser∣uiceable industry to intise the Gentleman to this house and that house and indéede to euerie house, but (that wée could perceiue) hee entered into no house, the scriueners had drawne and hanged out very faire Bonds and Inden∣tures to lap him in, but we were very doubtfull he would not be bound prentise (at these yeares) to them or any one, the milliners threw out perfumes to catch him by the nose, and so (like a beare) to lead him to the stake, swéete gloues to fit his hand of what size soeuer, but they could not come to take him by the handes, the Drapers wondered that hauing kept so many men before times, (and beeing so well able to kéepe them too) that hée bought no new li∣ueries, therefore they could not imagine, but that hée had béene at dice and lost his reuenewes, so rke and was faine to liue retired with himselfe and his page a while, which was in our opinions a likely coniecture, being him∣selfe so great a personage, well this obscure place must we finde or els wée returne (sine fructibus laborum) and open∣lie hee cannot be, unlesse hee stop his eates and will not, but hée must néeds heare proclamations for himselfe, as costermongers cry out for him offering him good holsome windebreaking pippins, russettings, apple-Iohns, and diuers sorts, al which tempt him not, but could they bring along Cue with the inierdicted apple of damnation, it would sooner be receiued at his adored hands, in like man∣ner cry out your Fish-wiues, Dister-wiues-Dringes, Lemmans, but none can penetrate his obdurate eares, so generall is the cry, and indeed lamentation to finde out
this concealed Mounsieur as if Troy were now in her present destruction, yet must not wee (with the Greekes) lay a strain there and  no further, but (vsque ad inferos) till we finde him. Upon the necke of this meditation wee fell vpon a yet more hopefull accident, wee approached a post-gar∣ded doze beset round with many petitionary attendants that waited the turning of the key that yet stood the wrong way, and was indéed the mansion or rather kennell of a most dogged vsurer, (so much wee gest) and so it fell out, for those attendants, (with whom wee ioyned our obedi∣ent seruice) in the Interrim, while the lockes were set at libertie told vs wée had happened right if wée sought such a Gentleman, for sure there hee was by great pre∣sumptions, or els hee had no béeing, marrie, whether hée would be speake withall or no, that they could not tell, for (quoth one) the maister of the house is a man that loues that Mounsieur (you enquire for) more then any man I know. Nay, to say the truth, better then his child, his owne life, nay (I should not lie to say) better then his soule (if he haue any) and great reason therfore he should lie where he is so well beloued, marry there is great doubt of his con∣cealing, for hee cannot abide him out of his sight, vnlesse perhaps some of his great friends (and great they must bée howsoeuer friends) chance to request his company for a time to take viewe and possession of a purchase or to the erecting of some new edifice, and then are they on the other part bound in worse bondes and mana∣cles then the Turkes Galli-slaues to bring him in at such a day, or they fall into the deuouring mercilesse awes of prison where no man but Mounsieur Money can redéeme them, and hée then will not come at them. This description of him scarce finisht, but wee were euen readie to haue eye-proofe of what wee had heard,
we might now heare the tonguelesse staires tell vs (by force of an oppressiue footing) that there was some-bodie descending, which was better vered by a rewmatique disposition of the descender, for (with small Interims) now and then we might heare on hawking, and vomitting the best part of his corruption, that was his steame, for there was no part of him lesse harming, (yet that noisom ynough), anon his gouty footmanship had reacht the dore, where after the quest of, who was there; and our most humble answere, the locks & bolts were set at liberty, & so much of the dore was opened as we see the compasse of a bakers purgatory, or pillory, for euen so showed his head forth the dores, but as ill a head in forme (and worse in condition), then euer held a spout of lead in his mouth at the corner of a Church, an old moth-eaten cap buttoned vnder his chinne: his visage (or vizard) like the artificiall Iewe of Maltaes nose, the wormes fearing his bodie would haue gone along with his soule, came to take and indéed had taken possession, where they péept out still at certaine loope holes to sée who came néere their habitation: vpon which nose, two casements were built, through which his eyes had a little ken of vs, the fore part of his doublet was greasie Sattin, stil to put him in minde of his patron Satan, the back part eight penny canuas, a thing (worse then comparison) that loues not halfe himselfe, his heart made of the palmes of foure felt-makers hands, his soule not so bigge as an Attome, & thas lung-growne to his conscience, which conscience is the true forme of a hedge-hog that gards her selfe round with sharpe prickles, that who so touches is in danger to bléed for it, his indust∣ry is to maintaine his scalpe in a warme cap, his stinking féete in socks, his nose in sacke, his guts in capons, and his braines in mischeife: to this lumpe of iniquity, this li∣uing carrion, this house-kept for, thats only preserued to stinke (and the headach, which hee was not good for) wée (to show our humillitie) bent ith hammes, and gaue him
the worshipfull salute, he receiu'd it, and grumblingly pro∣ceeded to know what wee would with him? wee with a little smooth preface, as being afraide at first to fright him with our Embassage, tolde him wee were men that had vnder-taken a voyage, which if wee return'd with the performance would trebble a wealthy estate for vs all, and on the contrary if wee faild in the enterprise, we were vndone, to giue the banckrouts phrase, (and the most common forms of a apsters head) broke, or like the olde Gunne-powder-house blowne vp. All this appear'd to him (as it was indéed) circumstance, therefore hee de∣sired to goe a néerer way to it, and show the very subiect of the matter: faith wee told him that we sought a wan∣dring conceald traueller, and that wee had receiu'd cer∣taine notice that he had taken by his lodging at his house, this was pitch throwne vpon burning toe, and oyle vpon that to quench it withall, that face that was wilde-fire before, was now Hell-fire, raging and boyling as if the poore harmelesse wormes should then haue suffered tor∣ment; some flew out with feare, others were murthred euen in their Cabbins, that the bloud ranne about his guil∣tie ose, with the very suddaine skrewing of his face, yet after coller had procur'd a foaming vent, hee randed out these sentences, Money, vengeance and Hell so soone as Money, he will not bide with mee, he answers not my loue with his company, he has promisd me increase, but hée re∣turnes not himselfe, I haue partchment indéed, which is rotten shéepe-skinnes, I haue Inke which is gall to me, I haue paper, which is rags and trash, I haue ware, but no honnie no money, no money, no honney, I let him forth a gally-slaue to banckrouts, and now hée's sold to the Turke or the Diuell, I would I were with him wher-euer: I could hang my selfe to learne witte. Had not he wit thinke yee that gouern'd forty madde folkes? and he hangd him∣selfe, why should not I and you come to kéepe my torment in action, to enquire for him? I haue bills, and bonds, and
scroules, and ware, but no honnie, no honnie, no monie, no money, with that in a great rage hee clapt to the doores, charg'd the locks to keepe the doores, and went by the staires (I hope) to hang himselfe. This was cold comfort still, wee were now no néerer then when we first set forward, all that we knew by what was past, was that wee knew many places where he was not: many places we séeke, but that place was (as report sayes) the enchanted land: when wee suppose wee are neare, it is still further off, that now wee feared it would be Terra incognita: Tante moles erant Romanam condere gentem. Yet at length it was built, and why should we doubt then but at length to accomplish our vndertaken taske, if the Libian club-man had receiu'd (by his enuious step-mo∣ther) this, as his first labour (and the age in ioynt cor∣respondencie with this,) hee had neuer liu'd to number such a Jurie of his wonders, well then let fame pricke vs on, that if we pursue and bring to good passe this labour, it shall liue vpon our tombes (so that wee bury no treasure with vs, and therefore be digd vp againe) while the brasse and stones can agrée together. We had now shifted our ground, and were come to the Rialto, where wee heare round about vs the confusion of another Babeli, (for languages I meane not for presump∣tion) at this place often arriues the newes from many lands, amongst the which might be (as wee hop'd) some tidings of our lost traueller: faith, wee by helpe of action and interpretation had quickly made our inquisition knowne amongst them all, but straight like honest men all agréeing in one tale, they returnd this reply, that they had receiued no newes from any countrey of such a tra∣ueller: more-ouer added that all their méeting and dis∣course was but to séeke and bring home the man we mist, to further which, they had sent ships out to sea, that if they
scap't the pirats, rocks, flats, and other sea dangers, would no doubt in time happily arriue in our coast: they con∣firm'd it by another reason which indéed sounded more credibly then the former, marry it was tolde in priuate, and therefore I am loth to be found a bla of my tongue, they laide some, I a great deale of blame on their wiues, but (for quietnesse sake) I would not haue them know so much, they told vs, that they themselues had often brought many of Mounsieur Moneys followers home to their hou∣ses with great hope (in the end) to attaine the companie of his compleate selfe, but their wiues (came he neuer so priuatly) would finde him out, and then (disdaining any such inmates to lodge in their houses) sent him out of doores, and whether they went to coniurers to performe it or no, they knew not, but straight he was transform'd into chaines, iewels, bracelets, tyres, ruffes of the fashion, which still were no longer liu'd then a wonder, nine dayes, then it was stale, and they must haue a new, and (for firme approbation of what wee say) looke but on our wiues, and you will say wee haue tolde the truth, and we (to please them, and séeme gratious in their eyes) must follow the fashion too, I know not by what clause in lawe it is remoou'd, but the burthen that lay vpon their bumms is now pla'st on our shoulders, wee haue verdingales to beare vp our bands, as they had to support their loose britches. This we deliuer to yée in priuate, and you may vse here∣in a friendly concealment, we promist what wee haue not now performd, so did we as long as wee could, and that's as much as any man or woman can doe, this was our an∣swer, and wee were bound to beléeue it. Well, then wee change our walke, and from the change we goe, where we had no sooner regréeted-the stréetes, but we might behold a comely troope of white headed Senators (such as some∣time adorn'd Romes Capitoll, when the swayed the world in a single monarchy) such as were habited to custome
and comlinesse, not to fanci and immitation, by whose graue aduise this cittie did support her name, which else would quickly haue turn'd into a wildernesse, like flowers growing in the vnbarbed field, for want of due polishing turne wilde and loose their swéetnesse, these gardners or guardians of this their little viceroyship, were now appro∣ched vs, whom (with a halfe amaz'd humilitie) we salu∣ted, and remembring the prouerbe (spare to speake, & spare to spéed) went forward to this milde inquisition. Reuerend, honorable, and worthy Gentlemen, we are poore petitioners to your patience, both for audience and answer, of one singular demand, (verbum molle frangit iram,) though they might haue punisht our presumption, yet they giue vs leaue to procéed, to whom relating our aforesaid tasque, some part of the paines we had alreadie taken, we as briefe (as we could) let them vnderstand our cause, and remain'd still attendant on their answer, which we staide not long for, but one voice answerd for all in this manner. Truly Gentlemen, yée haue vndertaken a great tasque if yée haue tyed your selues to the performance of it, for here 'mongst vs, yée haue certainly mist him, (a hard case, and a mad world indéed) when all complaine for money) and surely yée prosecute your course farre contrary to the purpose: for thinke yee to catch fishe with an vnbaited hooke, or take a Whale with a pursenet, then may yeere∣turne with a hare hooke, and an emptie purse: no yee must baite your angle if ye will come home loden. I must néeds confesse we haue had, & haue yet some acquaintance with that gentleman yée séeke for, but he will not bide with vs, I tell ye, he is a wilie fellow, not woone with good words, for then would schollers haue more nap on their gownes: nor with valor, for then you would happily bee more happy in his acquaintance, nor with feature, for then so many pro∣per men should not want him: nor with knockes, for then would Fencers be more fluent, but some aequiualent
goodnesse which is an equall ballance to him-selfe or he wil not stir else, it séemes you know not his company, that are no better acquainted with his qualities, I tell yée besides this he is an obstinat wilfull fellow, for since this idolatrous adoration giuen to him here by men he has kept the scepter in his owne hand, and commands euery man: which rebel∣lious man now séeing (or rather indéed to obedient too him) inclines to all his bests, yeels no subscription nor will he be commaunted by any other power, he is besides a carelesse and ruinous defacer of all vertuous and necessary antiqui∣ties, so him-selfe lie sléeping in yron bard chests what cares he what runs to desolation? if men vndertake (as indéed we of late haue done) but some good and necessary péece of worke, as the re-edyfying of a decaied gate, built new pla∣ces for the profitable swéetnesse of the citiy, ee flies away (as ye haue perhaps sometimes noted) with more dex∣terity, then a néedy debptor hath fled the hands of any of these our Officers, therefore truly, lette this confine your answer that amongst vs he is not to be found, only there are a few followers of his the better to direct and gid yée in your determined trauaile: with that we gratefully ac∣cepted some few of his attendants, and they rid on we still prosecuted our now halfe hopelesse iourney: from thence with few paces wee had reacht a faire and sumptuous streete, a place that if a man had only liu'd to please his sight he would continually haue made that his Horrizon, or if euery coniurer had but such a prospectiue glasse of his owne, they would neuer deale so much with the Diuell as they doe here lay plate both gold and siluer, Jewels rich & orient lay in beapes, here only wanted that god (by man created) money, here we made a dilligent inquirie, but straight were we turn'd with non est inuentus, all those (as they truly answered vs) alluring temptations were but to intreat the company of the adored Gentlemā hether which if we could procure with full and perfect progresse wée might commaund al we sawe, wée should be able to furnish
with plate Marke Antonies feast thrise trebled, marry otherwise. si nihil attuleris ibis Homere, foras. This though it a little dismayd our present busines, yet it spur vs on with a more seruent desire to séeke, know∣ing what infinits followed hauing once attained his res∣pected worthines with vs, we were now come to the place where the records of all ages were kept since the creation there we turned once many leaues but few to our purpose: neuer was such a search made, many taught by quintssece & acumisticall r ras to make a new substance of this es∣sence, but they were most made beggers that vndertooke it: this walke we had soone walkt through, now wee were entred the temple, to finde him there we had not such an vnhallowed thought, for there the pillars were hung with poore mens petitions, some walking there, that if they prai as well as fasted did very well and sincerely, nap the very Temple it selfe (in bare humility) stood without his cap and so had stood many yeares, many good folkes had spoke for him because he could not speake for himselfe, and somewhat had béene gathered in his behalfe but not halfe enough to supply his necessity, here could be little hope to find him that so much wanted him, we soone turnd our backes on this place, and had assoone espied many Haberdashers that had feits of many fashions but none that would fit this foresaid bare-headed tall man, marry for Mounsieur Mony if he came himselfe (for so they answerd vs at the enquiry af∣ter him) he should haue choise of any felts of what fashion or blocke it might be his pleasure to weare, little comfort we felt by all this, but yet we must not found retreat, for∣ward we go still, many hopefull places we passe, yet after our deliuered message, we were neuer the neare, many ho∣norable gates we left vntred, and the houses unsearcht because we wanted some of the Mounsieurs kindred to open the admittance, yet we might heare of their Complaint of defect, and therefore could conclude of his non residence
there; at lenght we passe by that gracious and seuerangly Inhabited pallace, where by the dues of reason this adored Idoll should be a seruile messenger, and no doubt , for there might we behold the Princely messengers from ma∣ny seuerall countries guerdond and presented with heares of treasure. But this runnagate (whom folly and ignorance adore, as they do stockes and stones) could here haue no place of authority nor abiding, but as a mercinary bond∣slaue; whether go we now? Faith now haue with you to Westminster: and what to do there? shall we take a cham∣ber & rest our selues a while? no, nor bry neither, weele to the hall first thats certaine: well away then, and take this for a note by the way too, if ye be the tongues walke , the Mounsieur is there if not al's a sléepe, we haue now with moderate paces attaind the entrance, lets not be vnman∣nerly knocke first, or call him by his name, perhaps, be with answer if he be there. o Mounsiuer Mony, me thinkes I here him answer lie a sententious taper I canot be here and there too here was a busie house the while, such can∣uasg of cases, that our case could not yet be heard, here were two brothers at buffets with angll in their  a∣bout the thatch yr blew off of his house into the others gar∣den and so spoild a Harlichoke: here two neighbours toge∣ther by the puses the good man Nebuloes goose had leid an eg in goodman Corridons barne and he pleaded posse∣sion and the trespasse of the goose that had committed bur∣glary to come in the wrong way: this had bin long in sute, and yet was no date to the end, onely it was thought the goose should die fort and be shar' betwéene them: then one knaue was in sute for calling another by his owne name, so busie they were about these and many other such cases, that we could get ne're an Atturny to deale for vs, so that at length we concluded to be our own Heralds, & proclaime our busines our selues, so choosing the strongest voyce a∣mongst vs, began our outcry, If any man (women there were none) child, towne or country, of what degrée, quality, discretion, either wise or ignorant, or howsoeuer in this place
could tell tidings of a wandring Knight, cloth'd in armors of preefe, of two especiall coates, either in totall Argent or totall Aurū, his horse trapt somtimes in leather, somtimes in veluet & somtime embrodery, let him bring certaine notice wherehe liues either at liberty or in prison and he shal haue for his paines a thousand duckegs, and this causd a general silence ouer all the house, ther's neuer an one either Attur∣ney or Clyent that could tell what to say, till wée came to a more familiar examination: And first we began with the Clyents, they swore (as I thinke without periury they might) that hee was gone from them, they came riding vp with him at the beginning of the Tearme, and that he did take the paines to accompany vs to the Hall, and here hée was, but he is now gon, and he slipt away from vs we know not how it may be he is yet amongst the crowd: if he think you iquire for him, to his indammagement perhaps hée will shroud himselfe from this discouery (and yée cannot blame him neither to séek his safety) if you could warily ob∣serue, I think you should find him hid here-abouts: this suf∣ficeth for ye poore clients answer we now addres our selues to others where our message was stopt vp in the mid-way, with Non est nobis argentū, wee haue sent out executions for his body, but he is not yet come in, some fragments (wée must confesse) we haue of his: marrie for the substantiall angelicall, and most dearely beloued Mounsieur him-selfe, they had no acquaintance with him, nor hee residence with them: This (Contra voluntatem) must serue for an answer, necessity (being but a petti fogger) has no law law hadde no eares; we hadde ne bels what shall we now doe? Desistere victo? No, not yet wée'll yet try further, In aduersis rebus, melius sperare supersis. Whither now: ther's yet a part of ouer-sea Citty to search? Shall wée a boord, and thither ere we see the country ma∣ny different opinions were held amongst our selues about
this, some said there was a beastly buffeting about him already; fight dog fight beare, the vncharitable whip∣ping of the blind, the old ape riding post, lacked by the mz∣led dog & the buls borne-mad to haue his company but it could not bée, some said there were others that offred to suffer the Germain strappad for his sake, and to daunce in ye aire vpō a hempen cloud, nay wonders (bot maculine & feminine) yet his presence will not be obtain'e, some others said it might be possible he was there, for there were many hard-handed men that laboures fore for him, and they per∣haps might attaine his worthinesse, that was presently con∣futed by another, with this obiection, that there we co many caps vsed for felt-makers to , that was on∣mouth caps, Wantig caps, Round caps, Mother-red-caps, and Fuling caps, and none could (but bad Church-Wa∣dens) beare the bell away all this (by the helpe of some more comforted spirits) could not dissmay vs, but to sea-ward wée goe, praying for a faire wind weather, and happy successe, but here was the fright, before we came to the water wee were no sooner come within the ken of flood, but we were on∣let with such a company of Carons, howling, hallowing, & calling for passengers, as if al y•  in bel had bin imrso∣ned, and begging at the grate, fines and frks that (God be thanked) could ver the soule but not torment it, yet indeed their most power was oner the boy, for here an audacous mouthing-randing-impudnt-scullery-wastecoat-and-bodi∣ed Rascal, would haue hall'd a penny from vs for his scul∣lersh pan other paire of water-panars would pu  fee for his (w) Dares; & we should ride like ger (or rather almost empt hoshads) a  for it, but such hayling, howling and pulling there was that wee durst not ventr the flood, the wharfe being so dangerous, and further stioning y• condition of the Sea-monsters, twasold v they did b howlingly sing: for Mounsieur monie that we sought for for vs the treacherous Leuiabans had not car'd to haue ouerwhelm'e vs, had they once boored vs, well,
it was, that it was so, now hey for the country we had past. We haue past the citty as good councell passes the cares of a negligent auditor, in at the one side & out at the other and done no good within, hey for the country another while. quod non in Gallia forsitan in India. Many daies we trauelld, and many miles we measured are we reish any place (hauing the city  in our eyes of apprehension) where we might enquire for our departed friend and not be laught at for our labours, we were many times in a wood and indeed seldome out, yet it may be this ūr dealt like a Laping with vs, and cryed  of the ne; though the citty might promise  thow,  in the country might maine his being, we therefore without further question slept to a Farmers,  where we inten∣ded to vse the authority of our inquisition, his  first salu∣fe vs with a fii outh, which likewise serued for alarum bell to tell them within that one or more was entred the gates, vpon which summons, the goodman of the house came to the doore a Iolly chuff, a good formall russetcoate, and a reasonable strature for a ury man, bee were about to encounter him at first sight with our busines, but were pre∣ēted by his former salutes, for in a plaine country gréeting he inuited vs to drinke and eate with him such caes as the house afforded, good stomackes are soone invited, we had scarce the maydes manners to say nay and take it, but to take before we say nay: in we were brought, where we had cases to please fiue seuerall nations, we had the Duch-mans , Butter and Bacon, we might haue made tosts to our butter and varied it to another place as proper, we had Roots for the French-man a Pippin Pye for your Irish∣man, and a péece of chéese for the Cambro-rittansal these ifferences each one made a shift to draw to one head, once  had small béere which pleaseth no nation: this matter being reasonable well canual'd we fell to another discorse, the goodman was or would be if he might (it was his owne
phrase) so bold as to enquire whence we came and whither we would, we answered him we could resolue him whence we came, but whether we would we knew not, for that we had vndertaken a thing worse then the conquest of the In∣dies, at which he shewed vs his gums and was very plea∣santly importunate to know what it was:  saith as we had made no boues of his meate we did not of out message, told him such an one wée had long sought and him wée must séeke till we nd (vsque ad necem) with all we requested to know if he had not alighted at his house, for it was a gene∣rall report in the citty that this hard yeare he had taken his leaue of them and came into the country to buy come: bée premeditated no reply, but told vs briefely there he was not nor could it stand with reason why he should: no, no, sayes he, hee neuer visits vs in the country vnlesse it bee in some contagious pestilent time, when he is so nicted that we dare not receiue him, and then he comes downe, marry he lies without heers for his labo nay he that will not sée vs in prosperity let him kéepe away in misery, alacke alacke, he now scones our flock-beds, if we but méete with him at the market we can scarse  his company home, our great Land-lords bespke him with lofty rens with fins; and Pretoes and I know not what: deare yeares quoth ye? tis not we that thriue by deare yeares, they are deare to be, our graine is in the vsurers graner  it be growe, if we can kéepe but the plowgh at the Dretaile, spre one to fa against Christmas, our care is taken, mary for the gentle∣man you séeke for he is so seldome in sight with vs, that he is almost out of mind, a Scilla: in Charibdin, this géere wē to worke, (as Rope makers so) backeward, what reply could we make but a faint farwe what could now ur me∣ditation be, but amazement  shall  yet procéed where their's, no hope of  take the hary soldiers Mot∣cto Dumspiro spero,  breath, though almost out of breath therefore lets forward: on wée gee, but still no Midwife could be found to liuer vs of our traraite,
many daies labour we cut of, but still (like Hidracs beads) more came in the places, as weloy and inuencible as the other, wee past vp a ann is boore and hee confest het had broke the statute by antedating his bibes and taking the leane lether from the fat before the time, and all for the loue of Mounsire Mony, yet he could not winne his compa∣ny: many tradesmen swore they had (like knights of the Post) for swore them-selues all for his sake and yet went without him: the Lapster hath froth'd halfe way, but whi∣ther the Diuell had let it out a nights or no, be know not, but he could not thriue by it, indéed generally honest men, Millers and all estates did complaine and lament the ab∣sence of this their deare friend, in yt obseruance of al which, time and trauell had now brought vs in kene of a very pleasantly scituated towne, faire and sumptuously builded, partly (though not equally) deuided with a sweet currant streame, which both brought swéetnes with it selfe and bore away the anoyance of the towne, with no more preiudice to it selfe then as a drop of poyson throwne in the Dcean, whose vndiscouerd greatnes kills the opperation, where meeting one that could resolue vs, we questioned the name and quality of it: who wondered we knew it not, being one of the two sisters (being no more in the land but two) from whom as from two euerflowing fountaines, wisdome and doctrine continually old abound, we had little to examine further of either wisdome or learning, but mony we en∣quire for, and of him we desird to know if that we thought he might not be ther resident: fraith no by many presump∣tions there hee could not bee, hee guest him (though be were a great traueller) yet he was but a small student, for otherwise he would not kéepe company so much with fooles, nor any ascending degree there he could not take, for that he had attaind more worship and adoration already, thē they could alow any title for, & for the inhabitants which were all painefull labourers after the quest of wisdome and vnderstanding, and harboured not so much as a thought too
bring him into their companie, their commons was to short for him, their habits too ciuill, and their arguments to quarrelsome, alas, sir Money has no fellowship with them, they are rather (be it no disparagement for them, to haue themselues so term'd) Liberalities beads-men, and the sonnes of Wisdome: these faire foundations were raide in former ages, when this close soiourning Knight you séeke for ridde a horse-backe in open view, without a coach or a bizard before his face, 'twas Money that buil∣ded all these (Gentlemen) marrie hée was forst to it by the great, great grand-fathere to these that now kéepe him back, then was Englands whole yeare but a Saint Georges day, then had a Noble man a hundred or two continually about him, but this question Gentlemen will driure mee too farre in contemplation, therefore Ile take leane of troubling yée any further, I with yée were in a better way, for sure yée are now out of the way quite. Wee now stuck fast, and knew no way out, and thought better to scramble out the way we came, then throw our selues into some irreuocable place, wee thus resolu'd, turn'd back, and in a rage bad the Diuell goe with him, for wee would séeke no further, the Diuell was no sooner in our mouthes, but he helpt vs to another proiect in our mindes, we now (sauns feare) would goe the néerest way and know where he was quickly. And concluded certainly that his residence was not on earth. What then? shall wée giue ouer the quest? no, to hell first: agréed, agréed, euery man choose his sworne brother (euery Theseus his Piri∣thous) & lets along: but who knowes the way? and whi∣ther there be such a locall kingdome or no? oh yes, there's one could tell that had read Policronicon how many mile it was to it downe-wards, that was thrée thousand,  hundreth, fiue and fortie mile and almost a halfe, this séein'd a tedious descent, without a good pairs of staires, and wee durst not vndertake it, it was better conside∣red to cut of a great deale of the iourney, and to go head∣long,
long and bee there quickly, and that way was assooe sod, vz. we should returne back to the Suburbian Bor∣dello (before mentioned) and there to hire hackneis would hurry vs to Hell and damnation suddainely, what shall wee not do for so great a friend as Mounsieur Money? come, take horse and away. The conclusion was put to most voices, which vpon bet∣ter consideration ws giuen on the contrary, for saies one (wat it seemed was well read in the quallities of them) it were a farre eaer (though very painefull and not so speedie) iourney by land, for this way yée ride through mercilesse fire and water, tis Hell all the way to Hell, and if yée will giue the hearing ile giue yée a part of their ca∣racter, yet I am loath to foule the swéet ayre I draw, and extinguish with so polluted a rehearsall: they are faire out∣sides of sie, but like deceitful bogges our-hid with snow which melted off (vah, vah, per Stigia vehor) I am now in Hell in apprehension, yet if the Satirist would take this out of my tongue to giue trophée too, hée must confesse it were pitty that beauty and brasse-browed impudence so vnhappely met, there are lisping tongues to entise, songs to prouoke, teares extemporall Hienna-like to beguile, othes to summon an earth-quake, and mooue the marble Geometrie of Heauen, and suddainely to bring downe the pendant prodegies that ouer-hang the Zenith of ini∣quity, and to those othes their quantity in lies, (othes and lies béeing indéede inseperable companions) these raw-rosted-fire-prooued golden apples of damnation are the very common beaten pathes to Hell (I must confesse) (nam meretrix est Ianua mortis) but the way is so foule and daungerous, yée were better goe further about: In the neck of controuersie which way to take, whither the di∣uill had a further had or n (I know not) and meant to take some more pitty on be a little to ease our iourney, but wée had begotten the happiest and healthfulest way could be deuised to speake with his Diabolical blacknesse.
We would go to a Coniurer, or as some say a wise man, but I thinke to conclude him a conturer and no wiseman, were the best moderation, for I hold them méere Antipa∣thies. This was allowd a perfect and briefe way, (for we were now almost tyred) the Diuell had sure ouer-heard vs (what skill he has in muque I know not) but he has a good care) for presently was sent to vs a man (as after wee proou'd) for the purpose, a leane Meager fellow, lookt as if he had béene lately frighted with his owne pa∣tron a poore black Serge sute (scarce worth the naming) that if it had béene artificially flamed & burnisht yée would haue thought it had beene one of Lucifers cast sues, why should a man serue the Deuil & get nothing by it? but sure it is, God can kéepe them poore that the Deuil makes rich. But whats hid from the Deuill himselfe? when one of his poore rascalls can come and preuent vs and tell vs what we sought: we wondred at it, but desir'd him, since he so well knew our intents, to further our purpose with his best art, hee (for a little fée) quickly condiscended, and promist (if wee would) to bring the Deuill face to face, to answer our demand in whatsoeuer, whether hee him∣selfe were the Taylor to this lost traueller, or if he knew any of his confederates on earth that did detaine him, to the one wée agreed, that either himselfe should talke with him, or wee would if hee were not too terrible, ey∣ther was sufficient, and that following night wee should summon him to a parle: The interim while then, hee be∣stowd in preparing his incantations, exorcismes, caracters,  what dues & properties belongd else to his Cimerian Art. But to the purpose, the night was come, we were come to the place, where wee were st a loose off with a vali∣ant charge to feare nothing, our hardie leader himselfe that fearde not the Deuill, fell roundlie to his businesse with his circle round about him, where with some cere∣monies, and a triple inuration of great Beelcephon, the ground (not so hardy as the coniurer) begā to tremble,
that we all shooke for feare, anone (as if a whole legion of them had béene then taking Tobacco, and euen of such a sophisticated sent) issued forth such a cloud of smoake that wee could scarce discerne our artist, after that a noise so confused as if Hell had béene a fire and the bells of Bara∣thrum had béene rung back-wards, after this storme it be∣gan anon to be a little more calme, and then we might per∣ceiue a fellow (for sure he had more fellowes) appeare to vs in the shape of a miller in apparell, but as swartly as a Chimny-sweeper, to him our valiant orator propounded the question, whither such a wandring knight as Moun∣sieur Money was not traueled into Hell or no? he answe∣red no. The diuill (like a braue Maunder) was rid a begging himselfe, and wanted Money, (whither the diuill had bin a souldier or no I know not) but our hardie spoakesman was so bold as to giue him the lie, and bad him tell him the truth or he would force him, for he knew that he was in Hell, because he was not to be found on earth, hee an∣swered then a little nearer the matter, and told him, that his maister had put him to soiorne in certaine vsurers and extortioners houses, (very friends of his maisters) and that the day of his returne was not yet come, but ere long hee would be there againe: this seemed somewhat likely, but our arts-man better knowing his qualities then we did, was not yet sufficed, but the second time gaue him the lie, and layd another coniuro te or two vpon his shoulders, to tell him the truth, or he would binde him to his good be∣hauiour for a thousand yeares, then out came all, he then confest that he was in Hell, for the most part, many spirits had him vnder lock and key, and he was like neuer to bée set at libertie againe, and the reason was the diuill had so many children fathered on him that he neuer begat and so many of his owne, that hee had no other dowry to bestow on them, the earth was daylie more and more taken from him, as India, Virginia, and many continents, that hee
thought bée should haue no  them to inherit if Doomes-day came not quick, threfore mony by any meanes hee would not part with, many vsurers and o∣thers of his louing friends  against him for it, but he was resolued neuer to giue him liberty, this sufficed for an answere, the diuill wn ome againe and the coniu∣rer came to vs where he receiued his reward of vs, accor∣ding to our abillities, we bd the diuill kéepe his Saint for we would séeke him no more. The next voiage we vowed to make for wisdome, and wen we should haue more wit (then to seeke for Money,) whom if we mist on earth we knew where to séeke her without a Coniurer, it grew now breake of day, and wée broake vppe our search, Dixi. Take it as it is. Tam male nill cusum quod nuilum prosit ad vsum. FINIS.
