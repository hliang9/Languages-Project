Tudor rose French fleur-de-lis Scottish thistle Charles R. TRusty and Wel-beloved, We Greet you well. In these great and insup∣portable afflictions and calamities under which the poor Nation hath been so long exercised, and by which it is so near exhausted; Wee cannot think of a more Natural and proper Re∣medy, then to resort to those for Counsel and Advise, who have seen and observed the first beginning of our Miseries, the progress from bad to worse, and the mistakes and mis-understandings which have pro∣duced and contributed to inconveniences which were not intended; and after so many Revolutions, and the observation of what hath attended them, are now trusted by Our good Subjects to repair the Breaches which are made, and to provide proper
Remedies for those Evils, and for the lasting Peace, Happiness and Security of the Kingdome. We do assure you upon Our Royal word, that none of our Predecessors have had a greater esteem of Parliaments, then We have, in our judgment, as well as from our obligation; We do beleeve them to be so vital a part of the constituton of the Kingdom, and so necessary for the Government of it, that We well know, neither Prince, nor people can be in any tolerable degree happy with∣out them; and therefore you may be confident, that we shall always▪ look upon their Councels as the best We can receive, and shall be as tender of their Priviledges, and as carefull to preserve and protect them, as of that which is most neer to Our self, and most necessary for Our own preserva∣tion. And as this is our opinion of Parliaments, that their Authority is most necessary for the Govern∣ment of the Kingdom, so we are most confident, that you beleeve, and find that the preservation of the Kings Authority is as necessary for the preser∣vation of Parliaments; and that it is not the name, but the right constitution of them, which can pre∣pare, and apply proper remedies for those Evils, which are grievous to the People, and which can thereby establish their peace and security. And there∣fore we have not the least doubt, but that you will be as tender in, and as jealous of any thing that may infringe Our Honor, or impaire Our Au∣thority, as of your own Liberty and Property, which is best preserved, by preserving the o∣ther.
How far we have trusted you in this great affair, and how much it is in your power to restore the Nation to all that it hath lost, and to Redeem it from any Infamy it hath undergone, and to make King and People as happy as they ought to be; you will find by our inclosed Declaration, a Copy of which we have likewise sent to the House of Peers, and you will easily believe that we would not volun∣tarily, and of Our self have reposed so great a trust in you, but upon an intire confidence that you will not abuse it; and that you will proceed in such a manner, and with such due consideration of us who have trusted you, that we shall not be ashamed of declining other assistance (which we have assurance of) and repairing to you for more natural and proper remedies for the evils we would be freed from, nor for∣ry that we have bound up our own interest so intire∣ly, with that of our Subjects, as that we refer it to the same persons to take care of us who are trusted to provide for them. We look upon you as wise and dispassionate men, and good Patriots, who will raile up those Banks and Fences which have been cast down, and who will most reasonably hope, that the same pro∣sperity will again spring from those Roots from which it hath heretofore and alwayes grown; nor can we apprehend that you will propose any thing to us, or expect any thing from us, but what we are as ready to give, as you to receive. If you desire the advancement and propagation of the Protestant Religion, we have by our constant profession and practice of it, given sufficient Testimo∣ny to the World, That neither the unkindness of
those of the same Faith towards us, nor the Civilities and Obligations from those of a contrary Profession, (of both which we have had abundant evidence) could in the least degree startle us, or make us swerve from it; and nothing can be proposed to manifest our zeal and affection for it, to which we will not readily consent. And we hope in due time Our self to propose somewhat to you for the propagation of it, that will satisfie the World, that we have alwayes made it both our care and our study, and have e∣nough observed what is most like to bring disadvan∣tage to it. If you desire Security for those, who in these ca∣lamitous times, either wilfully or weakly have trans∣gressed those bounds which were prescribed, and have invaded each others Rights, We have left to you to provide for their security and Indempnity, and in such a way as you shall think just and reasonable; and by a just computation of what men have done and suf∣fered, as near as is possible, to take care that all men be satisfied, which is the surest way to suppress and extir∣pate all such uncharitableness and animosity as might hereafter shake and threaten that peace, which for the present might seem established. If there be a crying sinne, for which the Nation may be involved in the In∣famy that attends it, We cannot doubt but that you will be as sollicitous to Redeem and Vindicate the Na∣tion from that guilt and infamy, as we can be. If you desire that reverence and obedience may be paid to the fundamental Lawes of the Land, and that Justice may be equally and impartially admini∣stred to all men, it is that which we desire to be
sworn to Our self, and that all persons in power and authority should be so too. In a word, there is nothing that you can propose, that may make the Kingdom happie, which we will not contend with you to compass; and upon this confidence and assurance, we have thought fit to send you this Declaration, that you may, as much as is possible, at this distance, see our heart, which when God shall bring us nearer together (as we hope he will do shortly) will appear to you very agreea∣ble to what we have professed, and we hope that we have made that right Christian use of our affliction; and that the observation and experience we have had in other Countries, hath been such, as that we, and we hope all our Subjects, shall be the better for what we have seen and suffered. We shall add no more but our Prayers to Al∣mighty GOD, That he will so bless your Coun∣sels, and direct your endeavours, that his Glory and Worship may be provided for, and the Peace, Honour, and Happiness of the Nation may be E∣stablished upon those foundations which can best sup∣port it; And so we bid you farewel. Given at our Court at Breda this 4th / 14. day of April, 1660. in the twelfth year of our Raign. Superscribed, To our Trusty and welbeloved, The Speaker of the House ofCommons.
CHARLES R. TRusty and Welbeloved, We greet you well: It cannot be believed, but that We have been, are, and ever must be, as solicitous as We can, by all endeavors to improve the Affecti∣ons of Our good Subjects at home, and to procure the assistance of Our Friends and Allies abroad; for the recovery of that Right, which by the Laws of God and Man, is un∣questionable; and of which We have been so long dispossessed by such force, and with those circumstances, as We do not desire to aggravate by any sharp expressions, but ra∣ther wish, That the memory of what is passed, may be buried to the World; that We have more endeavored to prepare, and to improve the affections of Our Subjects at home, for Our Restoration, then to procure assistance from abroad, to invade either of Our King∣doms, is as manifest to the World: And We cannot give a better evidence, that we are still of the same minde, then in this conjuncture, when common Reason must satisfie all men, That We cannot be without assistance from abroad, We chuse rather to send to you, who
have it in your own power, to prevent that ruine and desolation which a War would bring upon the Nation, and to make the whole Kingdom ow the Peace, Happiness, Security, and Glory it shall enjoy, to your Vertue; and to acknowledge that your Ar∣mies have complied with their Obligations, for which they were first raised, for the preser∣vation of the Protestant Religion, the honor and dignity of the King, the priviledges of Parliament, the liberty and property of the Subject, and the Fundamental Laws of the Land; and that you have vindicated that trust, which others most perfidiously abused and betrayed. How much We desire and resolve to contribute to those good ends, will appear to you by our enclosed Declaration, which We desire you to cause to be publish∣ed for the Information and Satisfaction of all good Subjects, who do not desire a further ef∣fusion of precious Christian blood, but to have their peace and security founded upon that which can onely support it; an Unity of affections amongst our selves, an equal Ad∣ministration of Justice to Men, restoring Parliaments to a full capacity of providing for all that is amiss, and the Laws of the Land to their due veneration.
You have been your selves witnesses of so many Revolutions, and have had so much experience, how far any power and autho∣rity that is only assumed by passion and ap∣petite, and not supported by Justice, is from providing for the happiness and peace of the people, or from receiving any obedience from them, without which no Government can provide for them; that you may very reasonably believe, that God hath not been well pleased with the attempts that have been made, since he hath usually en∣creased the Confusion, by giving all the success that hath been desired, and brought that to pass without Effect, which the De∣signers have proposed, as the best means to settle and compose the Nation; and there∣fore We cannot but hope and beleive, that you will concur with Us in the remedie we have applyed, which to humane under∣standing is only proper for the Ills we all groan under; and that you will make your selves the blessed Instruments to bring this blessing of Peace and Reconciliation upon King and People, it being the usual method in which Divine Providence delighteth it self, to use and sanctifie those very means which ill men design, for the satisfaction of
private and particular Ends and Ambition, and other wicked purposes, to wholesome and publick Ends, and to Establish that Good which is most contrary to the Designers; which is the greatest Manifestation of Gods peculiar Kindness to a Nation, that can be given in this world. How far we resolve to preserve your Interests, and reward your ser∣vices, we refer to our Declaration; and we hope God will inspire you to perform your Duty to Us, and to your Native Countrey, whose happiness cannot be separated from each other. We have entrusted our Wel-beloved Servant Sir John Greenvile one of the Gen∣tlemen of Our Bed-chamber, to deliver this unto you, and to give Us an accompt of your Reception of it, and to desire you in Our Name, that it may be published. And so we bid you farewel. Given at Our Court at Breda this 14. of Aprill 1660. In the twelfth Year of Our Reign. Received 1. May 1660. To our trusty and wel-beloved General Monck. to be by him communicated to the President and Council of State, and to the Officers of the Armies under his Command.
HIS MAJESTIES DECLARATION CHARLES REX, CHARLES, By the Grace of God, King of England, Scot∣land, France, and Ireland, De∣fender of the Faith, &c. To all our loving Subjects of what Degree or Quality soe∣ver, Greeting. If the General Distracti∣on and Confusion, which is spread over the whole Kingdom, doth not awaken all men to a Desire, and Longing, that those Wounds which have so many years toge∣ther been kept bleeding, may be bound up, all We can say will be to no purpose: Howe∣ver, after this long silence, We have thought it our Duty to Declare how much we desire to contribute thereunto; and that, as We can never give over the hope in good time to obtain the Possession of that Right, which God and Nature hath made Our Due; So We do make it our daily Suit to the Divine Providence, that He will in Compassion to Vs and Our Subjects, after so long Mise∣ry and Sufferings, remit, and put Vs into a quiet and peaceable Possession of that Our Right, with as little Blood, and Da∣mage
to our People as is possible: Nor do We desire more to enjoy what is Ours, then that all Our Subjects may enjoy what by Law is theirs, by a full and entire Admini∣stration of Iustice throughout the Land, and by extending Our Mercy where it is wanted and deserved. And to the end that the fear of punish∣ment may not engage any conscious to themselves of what is past to a perseverance in guilt for the future, by opposing the quiet and happiness of their Countrey, in the Restoration both of King, Peers, and People, to their Iust, Antient and Funda∣mental Rights, We do by these presents Declare, That We do grant a Free and General Pardon, which We are ready upon demand, to pass under Our Great Seal of England, to all Our Subjects of what De∣gree or quality soever, who within Forty dayes after the publishing hereof, shall lay hold upon this Our Grace and Favour, and shall by any publick Act Declare their doing so, and that they return to the Loy∣alty and Obedience of good Subjects; Ex∣cepting onely such persons as shall hereafter be excepted by Parliament, those onely ex∣cepted, let all Our Subjects, how faulty soever, rely upon the Word of a King, so∣lemnly given by this present Declaration, That no Crime whatsoever committed a∣gainst Vs or Our Royal Father before the Publication of this, shall ever rise in judge∣ment, or be brought in question against any of them, to the least endammagement of them, either in their Lives, Liberties,
or Estates, or (as far forth as lies in Our power) so much as to the prejudice of their Reputations, by any Reproach or term of distinction from the rest of Our best Sub∣jects: We desiring and Ordaining that hence∣forward all Notes of Discord, Separation, and difference of Parties be utterly abolish∣ed among all Our Subjects, whom We invite and conjure to a perfect union among themselves, under Our Protection, for the Re-settlement of our just Rights and theirs, in a Free Parliament, by which, upon the Word of a King, We will be advised. And because the passion and uncharita∣bleness of the times have produced several opinions in Religion, by which men are en∣gaged in Parties and Animosities against each other, which when they shall hereafter unite in a freedom of conversation, will be composed, or better understood, We do de∣clare a Liberty to Tender Consciences, and that no man shall be disquieted, or cal∣led in question for differences of opinion in matter of Religion, which do not disturb the peace of the Kingdom, and that We shall be ready to consent to such an Act of Harliament, as upon mature deliberation shall be offered to Vs, for the full granting that Indulgence. And because in the continued distractions of so many years, and so many and great Revolutions, many Grants and Purchases of Estates have been made to, and by many Officers, Souldiers and others, who are now possessed of the same, and who may be liable to Actions at Law, upon several
Titles; We are likewise willing that all such differences, and all things relating to such Grants, Sales, and Purchases shall be determined in Parliament, which can best provide for the just Satisfaction all men who are concerned. And we do further Declare, That We will be ready to consent to any Act or Acts of Parliament to the purposes aforesaid, and for the full satisfaction of all Arrears due to the Officers and Soldiers of the Army under the Command of General Monck, and that they shall be received into Our Ser∣vice upon as good pay and conditions as they now enioy. Given under Our Signe Manual, and Privy Signet at our Court at Breda, this 4th/14: Day of April 1660. in the twelfth year of Our Reign. Tuesday May 1. 1660. Resolved upon the question by the Commons Assembled in Parlia∣ment (nemine contradicente) THat a Committee be appointed to prepare an Answer to His Ma∣jesties Letter, expressing the great and joyful Sence of this House of His Gracious Offers, and their humble and hearty Thanks to His Majestie for the same, and with professions of their Loyalty and Duty to His Majestie; and that this House will give a speedy Answer to His Majesties Gracious Proposals. Resolved, &c. (nemine contradicente) THat the Letters from His Majestie, both that to this House, and that to the Lord General, with His Majesties Declaration which came inclosed, and the Resolve of this House thereupon be forthwith Printed and Published. Wil. Jessop Clerk of the Commons House of Parliament.
