TO THE RIGHT HONOVRABLE, SIR ROBERT BERTIE, KNIGHT, Lord Willughby, Lord of Willughby, Berke and Erisby; my most honourable good Patron; all increase of honor in this life, and eternall happines in the life to come. INfinite are the benefits (right Honourable) that God hath prouided for man; but a∣mongst them all, the word of God hath the preeminence. For howsoeuer the fruition of the rest may seeme to make a man happie in this life; this, and onely this, doth make a man2. Tim. 3.17 absolute, as1. Tim. 4.8. hauing the promises of this present life, and that which is to come. Yea the keeping hereof doth addeProu. 3.12. an encrease of pro∣speritie to Salomons royalties; but the want hereof madeGen. 4.12.14 Kain a vagabond, and a runnagate, who was the heire of Adam the greatest Monarch; andGen. 27.40. Esau to liue by his sword, that had the birthright of better promises. The chiefest point of the Scriptures is that which saueth; namely,Rom. 10.9. confession of Christ, and faith in him. But that which striketh the veriest Atheist with greatest con∣sternation;
the false worshipper with most astonish∣ment; and the looker on with deepest admiration, isIsai. 45.21. & 41.21. &c. and 43.12. & 44.7. the propheticall spirit here to bee found, and no where else, truly, plainly and perfitly setting downe before hand, what shall be accomplished afterwards in his due time. Hereby the erroneous haue bin of∣tenMat. 22.40. &c. conuicted; and they whichDan. 9.2. &c. waited vpon the Lord singularly directedEst. 4.1. and comforted. This spi∣rit which hath bin alwaies in the word of God, doth fully shew it selfe in the Reuelation. For in it the Lord hath written vp before hand, the steps of his proui∣dence, by which he would rule the Christian world,cap. 1.19. from the time of the Apostles to the last day. Herecap. 13. the reader and hearer are blessed: the godly witnessescap. 2. & 3. of Christ are directed in their greatest tentations; andcap. 44. the honourable, wise and godly polititians in theircap. 4.11. and 5.5. grauest deliberations, andcap. 11.17.18 reuising of histo∣ries, &c. Now, though many haue laboured very profitably in the vnfolding of this booke; yet wise∣dome lieth so deepe in the waters, thatEccl. 24.32. the first man hath not knowne her perfectly; no more shall the last seeke her out. For her considerations are more abundant than the sea; and her counsell profounder than the great deepe. But howsoeuer it be, yet not∣withstanding withDan. 12.4. often running it ouer, know∣ledge is euer encreased; and this was my comfort that sought to be further satisfied in a scripture of so great vse. That which I haue attained vnto (seeing the importunitie of many godly men hath preuailed with me to publish) vpon good reasons, I doe hum∣blie present vnto your Lordship. For first, the Lord hath so mercifully disposed for me, that both I, and mine, doe liue vnder your Lordships patronage:
wherefore I was bound to make some remonstrance of my thankfulnes; and wanting other meanes I tooke this opportunitie. Againe, I was not onely set on worke to study this booke; but also much encou∣raged and holped herein, by your most honourable, wise, learned, and godly Father my dearest Lord; and therefore was to returne the fruites of my labour to his house. And further, I giuing it abroad in the lan∣guage of my nation, as a counterpoyson against the shamelesse fraudes of popish seducers; your Lord∣ships experience affoording you greater satisfaction of the times than can be knowne by bookes, will be a strong retentiue to wauerers, when they see the re∣lation of the present popish impieties, to be patroni∣zed by your good Lordship. Great and many were the benefits which the Church of God obtained by the sincere and godlie profession of the Gospell, which your Lordships most honorable ancestors did make. Your LordshipsThe Dut∣chesse of Suf∣folke. grandmother did suffer much for the Gospell, euen vnto banishment; her Graces faithfulnes appeared herein, that in the daies of her prosperitie, and peace at home, she isBy Master R. Allen some∣times her Chaplen. repor∣ted to pray vnto God, with lifted hands and eyes vn∣to heauen, that the Lord would continue her house in honour, to the glorie of God, and of the Gospell of Christ for euer. Your most honourable father, with the blessed sword of Gedeon, did fight in the defence of the Gospell; and in a sicknes, thought insupe∣rable, stood so resolued in the truth, that hee desired none other graue, than to die in the defence of the Gospell, and of his Queene. Both of them regarded the Lords Prophets, and them that feared his name, both small and great. Their vertues haue a part in the booke of life, in the holie citie, and in the things
which are written in this booke. Honourable Lord, the loue you beare to the Gospell, and your wisdome in taking to wife a daughter of the true God, doe make demonstration that your Lordship doth inhe∣rit the vertues of your most Christian ancestrie. To your Lordship therefore I presume to dedicate this Treatise. The subiect is Scripture, and therfore wor∣thie your hands; the manner of explaining is some∣what new, a thing that is wont to bee desired; the maine is historie, which giueth contentment and in∣struction to the studious. Let the faithfulnes and du∣tifull affection of the giuer, counterpoise the home∣lines of the handling. And so I doe most humblie take my leaue; praying vnto God, that we which ho∣noured your Lordships most honourable ancestrie, may still encrease our thankfulnes to God, and the ioy we take to see your Lordship and all yours euer abounding in all the blessings of almightie God; and that stil of your Lordship also Christ may say (as now he doth)Cant. 6.11. My soule hath set me in the chariots of my noble people. From my poore house at Halton-Holgate. Your Lordships in all dutie and good affection most humble, William Symonds.
TO THE CHRISTIAN READER. DEare Christian Reader. As the Prophet Esay in a case not al∣together different, so may I iustly exclaime,Esai. 53.1. VVho will be∣leeue our report? and to whom is the arme of the Lord reuea∣led▪ In the Old Testament the Prophets foretold of MES∣SIAS, describing the time, place and manner of his birth, life, passion, death, resurrection and ascension, and foreshewing that the Builders or chiefe Rulers of the Church should refuse him being the head corner stone. The learned Priests, Pharisies and Princes of the Iewes read and studied these Prophecies, hauing as good meanes for vnderstanding them (in all likelihood) as wit and learning could affoord: and yet, as the Apostle saith, they fulfilled the voyces of the Prophets by putting Christ to death. And why? they were worldly minded, proud, ambicious,Act. 3.18. and puffed vp with the opinion of their owne knowledge, they had cor∣rupted the truth with their owne deuices, and in their blinde imagina∣tion framed vnto thēselues such a Messias, that when the true Christ was come they could not know him: they expected a great Monarch, that should restore vnto them their earthly kingdome and the pleasures of the world; meane while, they crucified the true Sauiour, and fulfilled all things that were written of him. Onely a few fisher-men, and certaine poore and abiect women followed Christ and beleeued in him:Psal. 25.14. for the secret of the Lord vvas reuealed to them that feared him. In the New Testament in like manner, Christ and his Apostles fore∣shew the comming of the Great ANTICHRIST, they paint him out in his colours, what manner of one he should be; declaring the time, place and manner of his birth, life, tyrannie, pride, ruine and condem∣nation; and shewing that such as make greatest shew to the contrarie, should be the chiefest actors in this tragedie. The Pope, his Cardinals, his great Prelats and Doctors of all sorts reade and studie these Scrip∣tures, and are (to a naturall mans conceit) as likely to attaine the true sense of them, as any other: they talke much of the comming of this Monster, and yet themselues play all the parts in this Tragedie. And why so? they are as proud as the Pharisies, selfe-louers, ambicious, they haue corrupted the holy Scriptures with the leuen of their owne doctrine, they haue their fabulous inuentions touching Antichrist, so that they cannot know him: They looke for an indiuiduall Tyrant, a Jew borne, of the Tribe of Dan, who shall raigne but three yeeres and a halfe in Ie∣rusalem,
and worke I know not what wonders: meane time themselues indeede are that true Antichrist, and haue almost fulfilled whatsoeuer is written of him. O Lord hovv vnsearchable are thy iudgements, that hast sent them strong delusion,Rom. 11.33. 2. Thess. 2.11.12. Reuel. 3.10. that they should beleeue lies! That all they might be damned vvhich beleeue not the truth. Onely a few poore and contem∣ned people, vvhich haue kept the vvord of patience, haue been deliuered from that houre of temptation. The Papists wonder at our confidence in this point, and thinke the Reuelation to be so mystical, that no certainty can be concluded thence. But we wish them,Reuel. 1.3. Matth. 24.15. if euer they will enioy the blessing promised vnto the reader of that Booke, that once againe they would reade and consider; then happily may they learne that those things are hid from carnall and wicked men,Reuel. 1.1. Coloss. 1.26.27. which are shevved vnto the Saints and seruants of God: whereupon they may accuse their owne blindnes, and examine whether themselues be the seruants of God that see not the hidden mysteries re∣uealed vnto the Saints, and cease to make their grosse vnderstanding the rule and square of other mens knowledge. For my owne part, what elsewhere I haue written concerning the cer∣taintie of my knovvledge herein, I am so farre from acknowledging to be rashly spoken, as that (I thanke God) euery day I am more and more confirmed therein, as by sundrie other meanes, so especially by reading this ensuing-Tractate, and often conference with the Author thereof my louing friend, of whose holy life, graue and moderate cariage, pain∣fulnes in his ministerie, manifold learning and rare vnderstanding of Propheticall Scriptures, I shall not neede to speake any thing here, least I be thought too partiall;N B. only for thy sake (Christian Reader) I willing∣ly acknowledge that I haue profited and learned more by reading one sheere of this GOLDEN-BOOKE, than euer I could by all the In∣terpreters that I read on the Reuelation; as thou maist also do, if thou wilt vouchsafe attentiuely to reade ouer but the Authors Preface only with a single eye and docile minde. The Lord direct all thy studies to the glorie of his holy name, and thy owne soules health. Farewell. Thine euer in the Lord, Gabriel Powel.
THE PREFACE, OR INTRODVCTION: WHEREIN THE AVTHOR DOTH HVMBLY SVBMIT THESE his labours vnto the godly, and most iudicious censure of the right Reuerend Father in God, RICHARD VAVGHAN, Doctor of Di∣uinitie and Lord Bishop of London, his very honourable good Lord. HOnorable, and right reuerend Fa∣ther, as the mercie of God hath alvvaies abounded towards his Church, in giuing her Propheti∣call Scriptures, as a light that shineth in a darke place: so verie seldome haue there been wanting godly Prophets, who by diligent search haue so dressed these lights, that they haue shined to all that were about them, for their directions in the greatest mutations and difficulties. For the most part, vntill the time of the Apostles, this kinde of studie was so frequent and familiar, not onely to the good, but also to the bad; that many times it seemed Elisha was not dead,2. King. 6.12. that tolde the words which the King spake in his priuie chamber. Howbeit, though neuer Church had prophecies so particu∣lar
and plaine, as this of Christ hath vnder the Gospell; yet am I perswaded (I speake at your Lordships correction) that no age hath been so ignorant in the true vnderstanding of such as concerned their times, as (for of long after the A∣postles) the Christian Church hath been. For as all the Prophecies of the New Testament, which are many, haue been esteemed difficult: so this booke of the Reuelation hath been held impregnable. Now it is a part of S. Pauls apologie to the Elders of Ephesus:Act. 20.27. I haue shewed you all the counsel of God. The diduction from thence, bindeth all the Ministerie to endeuour the like, aswell in Propheticall, as Dogmaticall Scriptures. I haue therefore somewhat laboured in this kinde, but principally in this booke; and that (all praise be giuen to the Father of lights) to mine owne satisfaction in such sort, as that many godly men haue desired to commu∣nicate in my contentment herein. 1. Cor. 14.32.But the Scripture commandeth, that the Spirit of the Prophets be subiect to the Prophets; forbidding all to beleeue, or teach any thing, that will not endure the censure of the Prophets. The rather ought I to subiect that which I haue done herein, vnto your Lordships godly and learned censure, as a Father among the Prophets, because I haue la∣boured in this kinde, in a different manner from the rest of the Interpreters. If your Lordship like it, I haue enough. If you correct me,Psal. 141.5. where I erre, though you smite me I will take it kindly, and when any shall say vnto me, What are these wounds in thy hands?Zach. 13.6. I will answere, Thus was I wounded in the house of my friends. For the better direction of your Lordships graue and learned censure, I will communicate some part of my thoughts herein: for mine affectation of breuitie, and o∣ther
reasons of consequence, haue caused me to suppresse ma∣ny things of good importance. When I first tooke the Booke in hand to studie it, I saw it was generally accused by friend and foe, for inextricable hardnes. But when I read the text, and saw the title to be acap. 1.1. Reuelation, which is the1. Sam. 2.17. cleerest and plainest kinde of teaching, thecap. 1.2. Reader to be blessed, and the Booke to becap. 22.10. vnsealed, I durst not obiect any difficultie to the Booke; but began to inquire how it came to passe, that it was ac∣compted so hard. The phrase, though strange in appearance, is meerely propheticall. The method, though closely couched, is very Logicall. Wherefore the fault must be laid elsewhere, and not vpon the Booke, that it seemeth so darke and difficult. The reasons of the hardnes, vpon diligent considera∣tion, I resolued were these, amongst others. First, the iudgements of men haue been of long so fore∣stalled with the doctrine, that the signes of the latter day  are come, that the Interpreters haue laboured to finde the accomplishment of the Booke in the stories past. But be∣cause many things were not yet fulfilled, they knew not where they were when they tooke the booke in hand. They that in this age doe straine their wits, to see who can bring first newes of Christs last comming, besides that they ob∣scure this booke, they would haue vs to breake the comman∣dement of Christ, when many shall say,Luk. 21.8. The time draw∣eth neere, doth enioyne vs thus: Follow ye not them therefore. As also to violate the rule of the Apostle, which is, not to be troubled by any deceit,2. Thess. 2.1.2 as if the day of Christ were at hand, till Antichrist haue all things fulfilled vpon him, which are written in this Reuelation. S. Peter seemeth to giue the reason, when he sheweth that
the vntimely vrging of the last comming of Christ,2. Pet. 2.3.4. would be the mother of Atheisme. Secondly, when many doe vndertake to interpret the booke, they misse in the first foundation of their labour. For whereas it is most euident, that the booke is meerely prophe∣ticall, foreshewing the particulars of things present and to come; some of the Writers haue fled from this ground, vpon which onely there can be a safe building set vp, and haue laboured to make it Dogmaticall, containing certaine points of doctrine, handled before more largely and more plainly in the rest of the Scriptures: which cannot be affir∣med without some aduantage to the enemies of the truth; nor without some misbeseeming imputations to the holie Ghost, by whose direction the booke is written. Thirdly, many doe labour to make the booke an Ecclesia∣sticall Historie, from the birth, or preaching, or ascension of Christ: but mistaking the time when to begin, they put the whole storie cleane out of ioynt. Besides, by that proiect, they commit this absurditie, to say, that the things which were spoken and done in the eares and eyes of all men in the time of Christ and his Apostles, were in the time of S. Iohn so closely sealed,Cap. 5.3. as that none in heauen, nor in earth, nor vnder the earth was able to open them, nor looke thereon. Fourthly, some of the Interpreters haue laboured to re∣duce the Seales, Trumpets and Phials to certaine numbers of yeeres: but seeing the text in many places doth giue vs the knowledge of the visions, by the onely diuersitie of the mutations which befall the Church; wee may not tie our selues to numbers, but onely where the text doth bound the mutations with numbers. Fiftly, when as godly men had truly found, that the ty∣rannie
and corruptions of the Church of Rome, are liuely described in some parts of the booke, they haue also laboured to applie all the texts to Rome, which doe containe the de∣scription and properties of the enemies of the Church. But because in the booke is also handled of other enemies; be∣sides that the booke is obscured by this course, the enemie is aduantaged that espieth our weaknes, and the propheticall spirit is very much preiudiced; which being more generall, is wronged by restraint. Sixtly, the Historians, who in the iudgements of all men  are to be best helpes, first haue bin carelesse in setting downe the exact times of the occurrences, which they write of; so that somtimes it is worke more than enough to agree them. And then they haue rather consulted with their friends, than with S. Iohn for the heads of their obseruations. For the most of them doe labour rather to magnifie their Pa∣trones, and to set a glasse vpon a faction, than to deliuer the truth. Hereby it commeth to passe, that hee that readeth most of them, shall be sure to finde much wearines to the flesh; howsoeuer he may happily here and there finde a wise and vpright sentence. Seuenthly, there hath been found no age, till of late, so  free from ostentation and selfe-loue, but that the leaders of the times haue made it as good as mortall, to reprooue the monstrous conditions of the time, which are liuely descri∣bed here by the true interpretation of this booke: so that vpon paine of death it must be made to speake nothing at all, or any thing, rather than against the time, whatsoeuer be the truth. Eightly, some also haue not let to blaspheme this kinde  of studie as phantasticall and curious; containing either verie little, or that which God hath put in his owne and
onely power; and that no doctrine can be enforced out of Scriptures of this kinde. Lastly, these things, together with the multitude of bookes to be read, (which neither pouertie can prouide, nor weaknes studie) and the want of due conference of this booke with the former prophecies, to whom it sendeth his reader, I take to be some of the effectuall reasons, which haue impeached the labours of many herein. It remaineth now that I giue an accompt how I am per∣swaded that the proiect, which I haue laid, is the onely true and easie meanes of vnderstanding the booke. First, the text doth say, that it serueth to shew the things,cap. 1.1. which must shortly be done. Whereupon I con∣clude, THE THINGS DONE ARE THE BOOKE. Wherefore of force it doth follow, that the visions may, and onely must, be enlightened, by the carefull application of ALL the Ecclesiasticall histories vnto them. Secondly, the things are shewed to the seruants of God. Then must the seruants of God tell vs what they haue seene, if we meane to know them. And so we despise the iudgements of them in this booke, which persecute the seruants of God, be they otherwise for learning as profound as the diuell. Thirdly, the time was at hand of the prophecie. For S. Iohn was to write the things which were in action,cap. 1.9. cap. 1.19. at the time of his writing, and the things which were to come afterwards. Wherefore, without all question, the booke was to begin when it was first published. Vpon these three grounds I am bold to conclude, that The booke is a perfect Ecclesiasticall historie,NB. The ar∣gument of the Reuelation. shew∣ed to the seruants of God, containing whatsoeuer is materiall in the Church, from the time of the being
of S. Iohn in Patmos, to the end of the world. So that nothing of importance can bee found in the Christian world, which may not be referred to some part of this booke, as to his proper head; from whence it is to receiue testimo∣nie whether it be true or false; and also such due considera∣tion and censure, that it must be esteemed to be good or bad, according as the booke doth iudge. Of which my assertion, I find not any of the Interpreters greatly to doubt; yet none of thē (that I know) hath attemp∣ted to see, how he can make the text, and all stories of impor∣tance so to agree, that the collection of the mutations, with their causes and effects, may seeme worthie the holy Ghost. Wherefore, though I doe acknowledge my selfe euery way the most vnfit of all others; yet rather than it should be vndone, I haue thought good to gesse at it, as well as God hath ena∣bled me, with the small Librarie, and other meane helpes, which my poore estate would affoord me. Your Lordship may not looke here for a perfect Analy∣sis and interpretation of the whole booke; for that is a worke for a iust and full Commentarie, which here I promise not: but haue onely minded a generall disposing of the text for the storie: and therefore was not to be diligent, either in the preparations to the visions, or in the Scriptures not yet accomplished. What I thinke of the rest not greatly touched here, (as of the first fiue Chapters, containing the things which were in hand in the time of S. Iohn, and a prepara∣tion to that which was to follow; what of the sixt and se∣uenth Phials, &c. which import the confederacie of both religions, against the incursions of the Turkes; the great incredible and fearfull stirres that are yet to be betweene the Romanists and the godly; and of the diuision of the Pa∣pists among themselues; and what of the rest of the prophe∣cie,
which containeth the golden and happie daies of the Church, and the new troubles which shall arise when An∣tichrist is cast into hell; of the precise computation of the time, of as many of these things as is to be made by the po∣wer of the text:) I hope it will not be looked for here, be∣cause the nature of this Treatise doth not require it: yet happily, by the blessing of God, may hereafter appeare, if none doe better preuent me; which I much desire. That which I say my selfe, is, that by this proiect I haue bin able readily to reduce all stories of importance, to their certaine heads of the Reuelation: and to see the drifts and deuices of many writers, and some other persons, before I saw the particulars in themselues. And also to gesse trulie before hād of the future effects of some things, which, for any thing I could perceiue, were in mans reason to fall out otherwise. That which I haue done, I submit in the feare of God, not onely vnto your Lordship, but also vnto all such godlie Fathers and brethren of the Ministerie, who in the feare of God doe handle or regard his word. For the ignorant, as I doe much desire their edification; so I neglect their cen∣sures. The scornefull reiections of the malicious and ene∣mie that neglecteth, and with scoffing cauils and railings maligneth whatsoeuer doth not make for his phantasie and partialitie, I esteeme as such reproofes, as I will weare for a garland. As for the harsh phrase and haste in translations, seeing I seeke matter, whether digested, or congested, the godly will excuse. That which I would first admonish the diligent Reader of, is this. The booke hath a double method. First is set down the drift of God, in disposing the things of the Church, in the manner which he hath done; and this reacheth from the beginning, to the end of the eleuenth chapter. Secondly
is shewed the drift of the Diuell in his proceedings against the Church, in the twelfth and thirteenth chapters, and part of the twentith chapter. The rest, to the end, is an in∣terpretation of such things, as were briefly touched in some former chapters. In my Treatise I haue for shortnes and cleerenes ioyned both the methods in one, and put the inter∣pretations into the places for which they serue. The next thing I would admonish, is, that I haue diui∣ded this Treatise into seuerall periods and chapters; not according to the chapters of the booke, but according to the diuersitie of the mutations. Thirdly, that in gathering of the stories, I haue not tied my selfe to the whole discourse word for word, for it would haue growne to too great a vo∣lume, but haue briefed them for case. And where I thinke the Authors censure of the times doth agree with the text, I keepe it. Where the writer, by ignorance or partialitie, doth misse in his discerning, I take the briefe of the storie, and passe by his opinion, excepting in some very few places plain enough to be discerned. Furthermore, where the Historians in their bookes doe follow the succession of yeeres and per∣sons, I hold it sufficient to name the author, committing the reader to the easie direction of the yeere and person: but where any thing might seeme combersome to finde, I haue bin more plaine, giuing readie helpe to such as haue bookes of the same edition which I followed. Thus leauing my la∣bour not onely to the touchstone, but also to the test, I pray for your Lordships happines, and the edi∣fication of the Church of God. Your Lordships most humble in all Christian obedience, William Symonds.

PISGAH EVANGELICA. BY THE METHODE OF THE REVELATION, PRESEN∣ting to the publike view, those Canaanites, ouer whom our Lord Iesus Christ, and his holy Church, shall triumph after seuerall Bat∣tailes. CHAP. I. The first period containing a Battaile in heauen between the Dragon and the Woman. THE Reuelation cōtaineth acap. 1.1.. &c. demonstra∣tion of the most glorious and eternall pre∣sence of Christ, the Almightie one, in his Church, by his continuallcap. 12.1. &c. warre with the Dragon, the diuell,cap. 1.19. both in the pre∣sent time, when S. Iohn did write, and al∣so in the time that succeeded afterwards. In the time of S. Iohn, this fight is said to be incap. 12.1. &c heauen, that is,Mat. 13.24. & 25.1.14. in the Church of Christ, and manifest assemblie of the Saints; when the persecution is directly stirred vp against Christ. And this warre is described in the sameGen. 3.15. words, in which it was first denounced. In this wonderfull warre we are to consider, the Battaile, and Successe. And of the bat∣taile, the Enemies & their Manner of fight; the Enemies, are the partie Offendent, and Defendent.
The Defendent, is the vniuersall Church of Christ, shado∣wed vndercap. 1.12.20 the mysterie of seauen golden candlestickes: For the Church is theMath. 5.14. light of the world; as theExod. 25.37. golden candle∣stickes in the law, were the light of the Tabernacle. It is also called newcap. 3.12. Ierusalem, and thecap. 1.4 11. seauen Churches of Asia. For in the time of S. Iohn, the Churches of Asia, in a manner, a∣lone did publikely support the profession of the Christian faith. Wherefore S. Iohn is required to write to them, and in them, to all other Churches wheresoeuer. This vniuersall Church is also called acap. 12.1. woman, after thePsal. 45. Cant. vsuall metaphor of the scripture. In her description, we are to consider her ornaments, and child-bearing. Her first ornament is of her apparell, which is said to be glorious as thecap. 12.1. Sunne, hauing put on the LordMalac. 4. 2. Esay, 60.1. Phil. 2.15. Iesus the sonne of righteousnesse. For the Christians did pub∣likely professe themseluesEuseb. 3. 17. & alibi passim. to be Christians, which was the onely cause of the persecutions. The next ornament, is her Footestoole, which is said to be thecap. 12.1. Moone, that is, all mutable and corruptible things; these shee trode vnder foote, beeingcap. 2.9. rich euen in pouertie.Euseb. 4. 15. & 8.5, 6, &c. For the Christians refused life, honour, and riches beeing offered vnto them; and which some of them inioyed, rather than that they would denie Christ, or conceale the professi∣on of him. Her third ornament, is hercap. 12.1. cap. 3.8.10.11 crowne, which is said to be twelue starres, that is, the doctrine of the Lambes twelue A∣postles: not Peters onely authoritie.Euseb. 4. 14. 21. & 3. 34. & 5. 14. For the Bishops conti∣nually taught those things which they had receiued of the Apostles: which also they deliuered to the Church, as onely true.Sabel. E. 7. lib. 4. The manner of the ceremonies was bare and naked, hauing in them more pietie than pompe.Euseb. 4. 21. Then was the Church a virgin; for as yet shee was not corrupted with vaine doctrines. As concerning her childe-bearing, it is said, shee was
fruitfull in the greatest afflictions.cap. 12.. & 2.13. For shee was with childe; the faithfull taking care, to hold fast that onely faith, which they had receiued and heard, and to spread it abroad by all good meanes. Sheecap. 12.2. crieth in her trauell, by the extremity of her paines, as a woman readie to be deliuered.Euseb. 4. 3. For when the persecuti∣ons grew extreame, certaine learned and godly Christians, by their Apologies laboured to pacifie the minds of the Em∣perours. Yea the veryEuseb. 3. 30. & 4. 8. Gentiles, as Plinie & Serenius, wrote in the defence of the innocencie of the Christians, vnto the Emperours Traian and Adrian. The partie offendent, is acap. 12.3.9. wonderfull enemie, the Diuell, Sathan that old Serpent; or rather a monster compounded of diuers Serpents; but for the neerenesse of his shape; hee is called a Dragon, meaning the Romane heathen Empire, which by their idolatrie worshipped the Diuell. And it is here called a Dragon, that there might be an allusion to the temples of idols; inGesner. bib. 5 Ʋolat. lib. 25. f. 300. which were Dragons worshipped.Euseb. 5. 1. p. 62. b. And so the heathen idolatrie of the Romans, is here the ene∣mie vnto the Church of Christ. Moreouer, because these per∣secutions were a spiritualEphes. 6.12. warfare, in which the Romans did march against the Christians with spirituall armies; by a speech taken from their temporall armies, in which the Co∣horts were ledde by ensignes,Vege. 2. c. 3. in which were pictured Dragons, this enemie is said to be the Dragon. This Dragon is said to be firstcap. 12.3.9. Greate, more terrible than those of whome Strabo speaketh, which wereStrab. 15. p. 479. 80. yea 140. cubits, which may be by reason of his age, which at first was but aGen. 3.1. Serpent. And whereas there is a prouerb,Eras. chil. centu. 3. Except a serpent doe deuoure a serpent, he doth not become a Dra∣gon; the serpent of the Romane Empire, had subdued in a manner, all these countries, which were held by the former Monarchs, and so became very great. Then, this Empire be∣ing asEzech. 29.3. & 32.2. a Dragon amongst other nations, and the Dragon
beeingIsid. etym. 12. cap. 14. farre the greatest of any serpents or beasts, this Dragon must needes be terrible; both for his nature, and greatnes. His colour iscap. 12.3. Gesner. l. 5. Red; which commeth of choler, and the ouerflowing of the gall; to signifie his vnappeasable fury and rage in shedding much blood; of which bloody policie and those which succeeded there, it is said in hercap. 18.24. was found the blood of the Prophets, and of the Saints, and of all that were slaine vpon the earth. For besides the great slaugh∣ters the Romaines made to become the Lords of all; and the persecutions by Nero; in the yeere of our LordAnno 74. Carion. f. 114. Euseb. 3. 5. 6. 74. Ierusalem was destroyed by Titus. In which,Geneb. p. 490. eleuen hun∣dred thousand perished by sword and famine; one hun∣dred thousand were openly sold; sixe hundred were ex∣ecuted. Domitian also, in the yeereAnno 94. 94.Geneb. p. 492. Abb. Vrsper. who first of any, commaunded himselfe to be called Lord, and God, required all of the lineEus. 3.17. of Dauid to be diligently sought vp, and killed; and he put many Christians to death, persecuting them after the example of Nero.Euseb. 4. 2. 6. Traian slew many millians of the Iawes; as also did Adrian. He hathcap. 12.3. seauen heads,Isid. etym. lib. 2. 2. somewhat representing the Hy∣dra, of which the Poets speake. In all the seuen Churches hauingIsay 9.15. Deut. 28.13. Magistrats to deuoure the Saints. But they are also said to be seuen,cap. 17.9. because Rome their Citie was built vponVirg. Georg. 2. seuen hilles,Chron. chro. which were Palatinus, Auentinus, Ianiculus, Caelius, Aesquilinus, Viminalis, Quirinalis. And also, because it seuen times changed the forme of gouernmēt.Fulke in 17. Apo. f. 99. First ruled by Kings, 2. Consuls, 3. Decemuiri, 4. Dictators, 5. Triumuiri, 6. Emperors, 7. Popes and Emperors: He is crowned withcap. 12.3. seuen crownes vpon his heads, like herein vnto theIsid. etym. l. 12. Cockatrice. For euery policie had the so∣ueraigntie of Kings; the regall power being in their own hands. Wherefore it is said to the Church, thoucap. 2.13. dwellest where Sathans throne is. And as the SerpentIsid. etym. l. 12. Cerastes hath eight, so this Dragon
hathcap. 12.3. Euseb. 5. 1. tenne hornes, both to allure his pray; and also to push the seuen Churches, and all other that stand in his way. But they are tenne; because the Romaine Legion consisted ofVeg. l. 7. tenne Cohorts. And in the Apostles time, the countries sub∣iect to the Romanes were ruled by tenneStrab. Geog. 17. Princes, which were called Decharchae. The manner of the fight is diuers, as are the enemies. The Church doth fight withcap. 2. & 3. patience, with teares, and prayers, for theEuseb. 3. 33. & 4. 15. Saints did very willingly both manifest themselues, and offer themselues to all exquisit torments, which were deuised by the persecutors. The manner of the fight of the Dragon is, first with his tayle, for withcap. 12.4. his tayle he drew the third part of the Starres, and cast them vnto the earth, that theIob. 3.6. night might be blacke and cursed, wherein the childe of the woman should bee borne. And here hath this Serpent, the propertie of the true Dragons, who haue more force inIsid. Etym. l. 12. cap. 4. their tayles, than in their iawes. By the tayle, is signified the falseEsay 9.15. prophet that spea∣keth lies: and they which doe turne other to righteousnesse, doeDan. 12.3. shine as the Starres in the firmament. Now in these times, partly by the instigation of the diuell, partly by am∣bition or feare of persecution,Euseb. 3. 23. 24. 25. 26. & 4. 7. &c. very many became here∣tikes; and these were so much esteemed of the Romaines, that they set vpEuseb. 2. 13. 14. a pillar in Rome, in honour of Simon Ma∣gus, the most impious and abominable father of all here∣tikes, with this inscription, To Simon the holy God. These he∣resies principally sprang vp in the East, the third part of the Empire, and poysoned it with the heresies of Menander, that more pestilently continuedAug. de hares cap. 1.2. the blasphemies of Simon Magus: against the creation of the world, incarnation and passion of Christ for idolatry &c. Ebion, Cerinthus, Nicholaus, Basilides &c. which increased the former heresies, with new impietiesEuseb 4. 11. 14. euen at Rome. Besides, there were many that de∣uisedEuseb. 3. 22. & 4. 11. bookes, which they called, and obtruded to their
hearers, as Scriptures, full of vaine and peruerse, and vngod∣ly doctrines. As also they forged bookes, vnder the names of godly men, as ofEused. 3.35.

Iewes, heretikes, and priests of the Gentiles, did continually accuse the Bishops, and called importunately to haue them sought vp and martyred. For (said they) they are the fathers of the Christians. These were alwayes ready to prouide matter for their torment, and execute whatso∣euer might bring the Bishops and other Christians to their martyrdome. Yet did there step vp two for one, so that but a third part were cast downe.

And as he is fearefull to behold, so is he rauenouse, as the Dragons of India, which lie in waite for their cattell comming from their feeding, and doe much harme, often∣times they kill the Heardsmen, and thence prouide them∣selues of a large meale; Yea, it sometimes commeth to passe, that a Dragon doth draw the Indian, that hunteth him, into his denne, with his weapons and all, and deuoureth him; shaking in a manner the whole mountaine, in which he lodgeth, with his force and noyse. Vnto these sortes of Dragons are these tyrants compared.Euseb. passim. For the Emperors proclaimed seuere, fearefull, and bloody lawes against the Christians; commaunding that none should professe Christ; and if any were conuerted he should be killed, yea,Euseb. 5 19. that who∣soeuer
of the Christians were brought to the iudgement seate, he should not be let goe, except he changed his mind. Domitian, after the example of Vespasian, hunted after all that were of the line of Dauid, and persecuted the Christians;Fox Mar. ex Epistolis Tra∣iani. & plinij. Traian commaunded the Christians to be killed; which was done, without distinction of age, or sexe;Bergom. lib. 8. so that daily innumerable thousands were slaine: Adrian resolued to roote out the Christians, vnder whom suffered very many.

For vpon the death of Domitian,Euseb. 3. 18. 20. Narna called home al exiles. S. Iohn comming from Pattes, planted new Chur∣ches, and strengthened the old. As also vpon the intermissi∣on of Traian,Euseb. 3. 34. many godly men went abroad, and did the worke of Euangelists, preached to such as neuer heard of Christ. They laid the foundation of faith in new and strange places, and appointed Pastors there, &c. cap. 12.5.And that her childe was taken vp vnto God, and to his throne, The Lord causing theProu. 8.15.

Adrian decreed, that those of euery Prouince should accuse the Christians, if they did commit any thing against the Empire; but if any did traduce them without cause, the accuser should be punished with iust re∣uenge. As alsoAnno. 149. Antoninus PiusEuseb. 4. 12. 13. mooued by the Apologie
of Iustine, wrote about the yeare 149. that the Christians are not to be molested, except they attempted any thing a∣gainst the Empire; and that he that did otherwise trouble them, should beare the punishment, which he would haue inflicted on the Christian; but he that was accused should goe free.

For a lit∣tle before the times of Constantine, a counterfeit religion, shadowing the rites of the gentiles, was mixed with true christian religion; not otherwise then false prophets that arise amongst the Prophets, and false Apostles among the Apostles. So that from hence, 1260. yeeres, the Church is mingled with the wicked; and is safe amongst them; and liueth at their costs. Besides that,Isid.

The onely difference is, that wee haue the trueth without sha∣dowes; and therefore our Tabernacle hath neither vaile nor couering, nor boardes to inclose it, but standeth erected
openly in the world, vnder heauen. Hereupon thecap. 12.7.3. Dragon, the diuel beginneth new warres, in heauen and in earth: There was a great battaile in heauen, that is, in those places of the world where the Gospell of theMatth. 13.19.24. kingdomè of heauen was publikely professed. Of this battaile, we are to consider the enemies, their manner of fight, and the successe. The enemies in this battailecap. 12.7. are Michael, and his An∣gels, which fight against the Dragon and his Angels: By Michael is ment thecap. 14.1. Dan. 12.1. lambe Iesus Christ, fighting by the man childe which the woman brought foorth; that is, the godly learned and valiant Christians, which sprung vp of the doctrine of the Apostles, when the Church had peace after the first troubles. The first seale.Thecap. 6.1. manner of the fight is so wonderfull, that one of the Cherubines doth call, as with the voyce of thunder, to all men to come and see both him and his furniture, to this warre. Wherefore first Saint Iohn dothcap. 6.2. behold, and loe a white horse,Psal. 68.13.14 white for honour, and a horse forZach. 1.10. speede. Hecap. 6.2. that sat on him had a bow withPsal. 45.5. sharpe arrowes, to pearce the hearts of men, by the preaching of the Gospel, and spreading of it by word and writing. For the learned men of that time did labourEuseb. 4. 14. 18. 20. 21. & 26. 28. &. 5. 9. &c. by preaching, and wrote di∣uers treatises: some of instruction in the points of religion; others of confutation, both of the gentiles and heretikes. cap. 6.2. PsalmeA crowne is giuen vnto him to reigne in the world. For whenEuseb. 8. 1. as by the graunt of Adrian, & the royall commande∣ment of Antoninus Pius, the crowne was set vpon the head of Christ, the Gospel spread abroad very speedily, and with much glory getting honour and estimation amongst all men; as well Greekes as Barbarians. The Christians gouer∣ned in principall offices amongst the nations. They with their families most familiarly did triumph of the profession
of their faith, euen in the palaces of Princes. Bishops were in most high estimation and price amongst all men. Very po∣pulous were the assemblies of the professors, and euery day the places for their congregations were made more large; all things prospered and increased; in a word, they were happie dayes. And being thus furnished,cap. 6.2. he rideth forth conquering that he might ouercome.Euseb. 5. 19. For the doctrine of saluation, did sub∣due the mindes of all sorts of men, vntoIbm. the holy religion of one the God of all. Now these things were intolerable to the diuel; by na∣ture enemie to euery good thing, and enuious thereat.cap. 12.7. And the Dragon, by the Romane Empire as yet heathen; and his Angels both Princes or Proconsuls, with the peo∣ple and heretikes, &c. did warre against him that sat vpon the horse. The Emperors like the bloudie Dragon the diuel, did often times moue very extreame persecutions.Geneb. p. 508. p 519. Euseb. l. 4. & Carion. For after Marcus Aurelius the philosopher; monsters held the Empire to Constantines time. This Marcus with his colleague Verus, moued persecution. After them Seuerus, and Aurelius op∣posed themselues against Christ, commaunding that none should become a Christian vnder a grieuous paine. Maxi∣minus persecuted the Doctors, Bishops, and other chiefe professors: Decius was a most cruell firebrand: Valerius a bloody persecutor: Aurelianus a grieuous aduersary: Dio∣clesian in the East, and Maxentius in the West, stirred vp most barbarous persecutions against the Church, which sin∣cerely professed Christ:Euseb. 4. 15. & 5. 1. For after innumerable torments and kindes of death, they would not suffer the godly to be buried; but after their bodies had laine for euery body to gaze vpon, some were eaten with dogges; some burned, and their ashes cast into riuers, &c. There sprung vp also innumerable heretickes, b as false
Euseb. 4. 21. 27. & 5. 15. 13. &c.Christs, false Prophets, false Apostles; whom the enemie of the Church of God, hating good and louing euill, omitting no meanes or opportunitie to lie in waite to hurt man, rai∣sed vp. These, not onely deuided the vnitie of the Church, with peruerse doctrines, against God, his Christ, and all god∣inesse: but also were violent, and double diligent to bring the godly into persecution, and to execute torments vp on them. Among these wasEuseb. 4. 37. & 5. 2. Tatianus, a violent enemie of the scriptures. His Disciples at Rome teach, that the scriptures are darke and hidden. They despise the Prophesies, &c. and be∣leeue a maide that was possessed with the diuell; they teach that euery one is to bee left to himselfe, and beleeue as hee list. Montanus also, whose doctrine was spread at Rome,Euseb. 5. 13. 14. 16. ambitious of the Primacie, esteemed certaine women pro∣phetesses, which prophesied lies. He taught to dissolue mar∣riages, prescribed lawes of fasting, called Pepuza Ierusalem, to cause all to depend on his Synagogue there; vnder the name of oblations, exacted money to feede the bellies of his preachers; wrote a catholike epistle after the example of the Apostle, striuing for new doctrine.

The arguments of his bookes in word pretend the Christian religion; but indeede it smel∣leth of gentilisme. He vsed many impostures of sorcery. Such like were many others. As Michael, vnto whom none can be compared, had An∣gels or godly ministers, that soundly and painefully con∣futed the heretikes: so did hecap. 6.3. wonderfully warre against the ciuill Princes. For he sentEzech. 5.16. & 14.21. forth his foure great plagues as occasion best serued, to auenge himselfe by them, of his enemies: namely, the sword, famine, pestilence, and beasts. For the better effusion of blood,The second seale. cap. 63 4. he sent forth so wonder∣full meanes, that another Cherub saith, come and see, which is a red horse. A horse for speede, and red for bloodshed; so that there were very ready occasions for effusion of blood. This horse had a rider, vnto whom power was giuen to take peace from the earth; to bring in warre, sedition, and dissen∣tion, that they should kill one another. Vnto this rider was giuen a great sword; that is very ef∣fectuall instruments, for the more speedy and cruell effusion of blood; by mutuall murthers and warres. For onelyGeneb. p. 505. & 513. An∣toninus Pius of the Emperors, was without ciuill blood. But from the time of Comodus his sonne, treasons, and seditions were alwayes among the Princes; when as from Augustus to that time the Empire had been free from sedition. The armies or legions, which before timePolyb. l. 6. were gathered of the chiefest sort of people; euen of Rome; wereMelanct. l. 3. in Comodo. now taken of barbarous nations. The ancient military discipline was ex∣tinguished; the rapine and lust of the Magistrates and soul∣diers grew extreame, in all the prouinces. And besides this ciuill sedition, some of them were slaine by warre. For DeciusGeneb. Ca∣rion. &c. was killed by the Gothes; Valerius was slaine by Sapor King of Persia, yea some had their bane otherwise. For Aurelianus was stroken dead with lightning.
The third seale. cap. 6. 5. 6.He also pursued them, as opportunitie best serued, with so wonderfull famine; that another Cherub cryeth come and see. To this purpose he sendeth forth A blacke horse, a horse for speede, and blacke for vnseasonable times, and for blastings, and mildewes, which make the corne of a blacke colour. His rider delighteth in famine. For he that sate on him had balances in his hand:Leuit. 26.26. not onely to deliuer out i bread by waight according to the curse in the law; but also to sell that corne by small waights which was wont to be solde by measures. The price also groweth excessiue. AWeckerus Ant. speci. Choenix, which containeth about thirtie sixe ounces, and was a mans allow∣ance for a day; is solde by the commaundement of God and his Christ, by a voyce in the middest of the foure beasts, or Cherubins, for a Romane peny, answeringBudaeus. to the Atticke of Ephesus, which was the sixt part of an ounce, neere tenno pence sterling. For when theEuseb. 9. 7. tyrants in their decrees for persecutions, did triumph in the fruitfulnesse of the earth, God sent his plague: for the accustomed winter showers did not water the ground, and so there came an vnlooked for and suddaine famine.Euseb. 8. 19. When Maxentius played the tyrant at Rome, his subiects did suffer most extreame penu∣rie of necessary sustenance: and that so great as neuer was in Rome before.Euseb. 9. 8. And when Maximinus made hauocke of the Churches in the East, the inhabitants of his cities were in manner consumed with famine. One measure of wheate was solde for 2500. Atticke, that is Romane pence; but we reade of no dearth ofcap. 6.6. wine or oyle. The fourth seale.Moreouer as occasion serued, the lambe sent forth a∣gainst his enemies, that would not haue him reigne ouer them, the plague of pestilence, and beasts; and this socap. 6.7. wonderfull, that the fourth beast or Cherub doth say, come and see. To this purpose is seenecap. 6.8. A pale horse. A horse
for speede, and pale for the discolouring of such as were smitten by it, with palenes and wannes of face. His name that sate vpon him was death, soIerem. 9.21. that death came vp into the windowes, and entered into the palaces by pestilent aires, to destroy the children without, and the young men in the streetes. There being helpe to be found, no not in friends or kinsefolkes. Hell, or the graue followed after as footemen, and shewed his seueritie in refusing to giue harbour, or lodging to the dead.Ierem 9.22. The carcasses of men lying as the dunge vpon the field. For vnder GalienusEuseb. 7. 21. there was an vniuersall plague ouer the world; but especially about Alexandria; inso∣much that euery man refused to helpe his friend. Vnder Dioclesian, theEuseb. 8. 7. Lyons, Panthers, Beares, &c. vnto whom the Christians were cast to bee deuoured, left the Christians, and ramped on them which stoode without, pro∣uoking them to seaze vpon the Christians, and slew many of them. ButEuseb. 9. 8. vnder Maximinus was the greatest pestilence of all; the people died in the streetes in great multitudes; the dogges eat many of them halfe dead; their carcasses lay naked, open, and vnburied; a most lamentable spectacle to those that beheld it. And as Michael the lambe with his Angels doe fight, that he might ouercome; so did the Dragon and hiscap. 12.7.8. An∣gels fight that they might preuaile, and keepe their places of idolatrie and superstition. The Dragon doth warrecap. 12.10.11. first by accusing the brethren, and then by shedding their blood. Many grieuous accusations were laide to the charge of the Christians; first thatEuseb. 3. 17. Christ was King, and so would dis∣possesse Princes. ThenEpiphanius. where as some heretikes did vse women in common, eating horrible meates (as young chil∣dren and womens menstrues, &c.) theEuseb. 4. 7. same things were obiected to the faithfull Christians. Yea the tyrants in their
edicts publishedEuseb. 9. 5. 7. very blasphemous accusations against Christ and Christians. They slaundered the Christians, that when they assembled to their Sabbaths, vnder the colour of seruing God, they polluted themselues with promiscuous whoredomes. That the iniquitie of the Christians was the cause of the famine, earthquakes, warre, and mortalities, and that the heathen gods did thereby reuenge the indulgence of the Princes towards the Christians. Of these, and such like slaunders they write books, which they giue to the schoole-masters, to teach their schollers. As also they hang them vp vpon pillars in all publike places, to be read of all men. Yea they forbadePolychro. lib. 4. f. 169. any man that would not sacrifice to their i∣dols, to buie, or sell, or take vp water. Besides their slaunders and disgraces, they added hereun∣to most barbarous persecutions,Massaeus 10. P.p. 131. 133. determining and com∣manding to roote out the Christians. The Churches in ma∣ny places wereEuseb. 8. 2. pulled down, and the scriptures burnt and destroyed. Yea,Geneb. p. 543 Polych. 4. c. 25. in one night, twentie thousand Christians were burned, as they were assembled in the Church: seauen∣teene thousand died of most horrible and vnnaturall tor∣ments, in the space of thirtie daies. EueryEuseb. 8. 6. 7. 10. 12. & in a∣lijs suis libris. one was the more esteemed for his wisdome and obseruance to his Prince, by how much he was able to deuise and execute tor∣ments most barbarous, vnnaturall, horrible, and painefull: they spared no sexe, nor age, nor regarded any persons of honour, nor affinitie, nor consanguinitie. Then was there no place of refuge,The fift seale. cap. 6.9 11. nor time of resting from these tyrannies. Yet is the successe happie for the Saints, who got the vi∣ctorie, and triumph: andCap. 12.8.9. miserable to the Dragon and his angels, whose place was no more found in heauen, but he was cast out euen into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him. The victorie is first begged of God, and then executed. Those which obtaine the victorie, get it by deprecation, and
are said to be thecap 6.9. soules, that is,Gen. 9.4. Numb. 9.4. Leuit. 17.14. the persons and carkasses, of them that had beene killed for the word of God, and for the te∣stimonie which they maintained; to wit, the martyrs which2. Tim. 4.6. were killed, or offered, so thatLeuit. 4.34. their blood seemed to bee poured at the foote ofcap. 11.2. Exod. 21.14. the Altar, beeing slaine in the place of Gods most immediate and sincere worshippe, for the Gospel and profession of Iesus Christ; of whom is spoken before. They crieGen. 4.10. Heb. 11.4. aloud for vengeance, beeing slaine, as Abels blood did crie against his brother Caine. They are honoured with white robes; which were giuen them: eueryEuseb. 5. 2. godly man esteeming honourably of them, that they were counted worthy to suffer rebuke for the Lord Iesus Christ. Yea they also were honoured with the vi∣ctorie ouer their persecutors. For howsoeuer the estate of the Christians in the former troubles was very desperate; yet the Martyrs by the power of Christ, did so constantly endure all the torments of their persecutors, that they ouer∣came themcap. 12.11. by that word of their testimonie, in that they loued not their liues vnto the death.Euseb. 8. 12. 13 For whē the tyrants had made proofe of all kind of torments, and were not able to aug∣ment their tortures, they dispaired in themselues, as not ho∣ping to preuaile by that course. Then grewe they wearie with killing them, and were glutted with blood. They also, by reason of certain wise and iust Apologies, which the Chri∣stians published in the defence of the flocke of Christ; feared least the Princes should iustly incurre a publik note of infa∣mie for the barbarous effusion of innocent blood. And so the persecution did slacke. Thus the victorie beeing obtained at the hands of God,The sixt seale. cap. 6.12. &c. it was presently pursued with diligent execution, by the Lambe now throughly angred. To which purpose there was a great earthquake, that is aIsai, 24.17.18.19.20. Ioel, 2.20. generall doubtful tottering in the minds of men, not know∣ing
what to settle vpon. Which grew by reason thatAnn. 311. Con∣stantinus the sonne of Constantius, who fauoured the Christi∣ans, was saluted Emperour. ThenAbb. Vrsp. was there a great motion in the Christian world. The common wealth was held by foure new Emperours, which had euery one their drift to be the chiefest; which caused the people to be infinitely distra∣cted. Besides that, othersMussaeus. p. 132. sought partly by treason to take away Constantine, as Maximinianus; partly by the souldi∣ers to place themselues, as Valens in the East, and Alexander at Carthage: yea the RomansVrsp. p. 79. Massaeus. were so perplexed with the tyrannie of Maxentius, that they called to Constantine for reliefe. By the stirring of Constantine, the Princes were distressed and confounded, as if the Sunne werecap. 6.12. as blacke as sackecloth of haire, and the Moone was all made like blood: soAmos. 8.5. Ioel. 3.15. that their daies were vncomfortable, and in the night they were in feare to be slaine. For hisEuseb. 8. 14. & 9.9. comming offended Maximinia∣nus much, and his proceedings made Maximinus sadde; Maxentius was also in exceeding feare, that he durst not go out of Rome gates. The Nobles andIsai. 13.10.13. & 7.2. principall ministers of estate, such as lo∣ued the workes of darkenesse, fell from their places of emi∣nencie, ascap. 6.13. if the starres of heauen fell to the earth, and so vio∣lently were they mooued out of their places, as a figge tree casteth her greene figges, when it was shaken of a mightie winde. The publike face ofIsa. 34.4. Agg. 2.22. religion was altered; as if the heauen departed away like a scroll, when it is rolled. For ConstantineEus 9.9. & de vita Const. passim. restored libertie to the Church, and by his edicts with Lici∣nius assent, decreed a most perfit law for the Christians, com∣manded all nations to become Christians, and shut vp the temples of idols. The ciuill policie was also changed, as if thecap. 6.14.15 16.17. mountains and Isles were mooued out of their places; whereupon all sorts
of men hid themselues, and grew desperate; fearing that the Christians would reuenge the persecutions which were for∣merly inflicted on them. For inMelanct. li. 3. Constantines time was one of the greatest and most principal mutations, that haue been in mankinde.

As vpon Pencetius, whom they called Honorable; Culcianus, whom they stiled Worthie; Theotecnus, whom they named Glorious. He also plagued with infamous torments, the kinsemen and chil∣dren of the tyrants; but especially the inchaunters and priests of the idols. Yea, he subiectedEuseb. vit. Const. lib. 1. 4. vnto his Empire all the west countries, to the great ocean; all Scythia, euen to the very north; Aethiopia, towards the south; and the Lords and Earles, as farre into the east as the Indians. He restored goodMelanct. li. 3. lawes and iudgements; decreed that the Christians should not onely not be hurt, but also that they should be admitted to honors. Thus the victorie being gotten and pursued, there fol∣low great triumphs incap. 12.10. heauen, that is openly. The Saints didEuseb. 10. 1. 2. 3. 4. publikely reioyce in the Lord their redeemer; and did sing new songs vnto God of thankes giuing. And Constan∣tineEuseb. vit. Const. 1. 33. entred Rome with great triumph, presently giuing thankes to the author of his victory, and by famous inscrip∣tions vpon pillers in the principall places of Rome, publi∣shed vnto all men the signe of Christ his saluation. Yea,Geneb. p. 556. he required all nations to forsake idols, and embrace the pro∣fession of Iesus Christ by his edicts; whereupon was fulfil∣led that in the Apocalypse. Now is come saluation in heauen: And thus was the Dragon and his Angels, that is, the diuel
and his ministerscap. 12 9.10. cast into the earth, so that his place was found no more in heauen; that is, he doth persecute Christ no more openly; but is constrained to oppose himselfe by earthly policies, by the pretence of godlinesse. This fall of the Dragon didEuseb. vit. Con. l. 3. cap. 3. Constantine expresse in a picture which was hanged vp at the entry of his palace, for euery man to be∣hold. His owne picture was made, ouer his head the signe of the Lords passion; the enemie and hostile beast, which by the tyrannie of wicked men had persecuted the Church of God; was pictured, cast into a deepe sea in the shape of a Dragon, and winding serpent (meaning the diuel) whichEsay. 27.1. was thrust through with a great sword. The end of the second period and battaile in heauen, which was the first after the time of the returne of Saint Iohn from Patmos. CHAP III. The third period and first battaile on earth, betweene the Ro∣mane Empire corrupted with heresie, and the Woman the Church. NOw whencap. 12.9, 12.13. the Dragon saw that he was cast downe into the earth, and his Angels with him; he is full of wrath, knowing that hee hath but a short time, Wherefore he disposeth himselfe, to bring wofull calami∣ties, both vpon the earth and the sea (in which he had many of his Angels) if by that meanes he might also further the execution of his wrath against the woman. For he drifteth the destruction of the Church. In the storie whereof, Saint Iohn doth shew his purpose and endeuour. His purpose is by foure ofcap. 7.1. his Angels, to stay the foure windes, that they should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor
on the trees: that is, to restraineCan. 4.16. the inspiration of the holy Ghost, that men, neitherGen. 6.12. neere norIsocr. 42.10. farre off, neither such as be worldly, nor such as seemeLuc. 23.30. by their vocation and profession to be godly, might be led into all trueth. By which meanes hee would bring in Thatcap. 3.10. houre of tempta∣tion, which should come vpon all the earth; to trie them that dwell vpon the earth, whether (now that the Princes were conuerted to the Lord) the Princes and peopleDeut. 13.3. would loue the Lord their God, with all their heart, and with all their soule. For about this time manyEuseb. vita. Const. lib. 3. cap. 62. & 2. 61. 64. Socr. 1. 4. Ruf. 1. 5. &c. damnable heresies were powred into the world; namely the Arians, Maniches, Nouatians, Valentinians, Marcionires, Paulians, Cataphrigi∣ans, &c. TheseBerg. in Mil∣chiad. &c. rent in peeces the Churches in Rome, Afri∣ca, in the sea coaste, yea euery where. This purpose of the Dragon is stayed a while; but the visions of this first battell are seene afterwards. The per∣son that doth cause the stay to be made, is ancap. 7.2. Angel which came vp from the east, that is, the recalling of the doctrine, which first was declared in the East; namely the promise made to Abraham, whereunto the law was a schoolemaster; which was taught by the prophets, exhihited to the Iewes in Christ, and spread abroade in the world by the Apostles. For saluation is of theIohn 4.22. Iewes. For when the Empire was torne in peeces, by diuers heresies, and contararie factions; the EmperorEuseb. de vit. Const. 2. 65. Constantine sent abroad his edicts, to stay any further contention; declaring that the true light of discipline, and holy religion, by the mercie of almightie God, did come out of the East; the professors whereof he respected, as captaines of the nations, vnto saluation. The end of the stay, is till thecap. 7.3.9. ser∣uants of God be marked; some openly, as in their foreheads; others by the doctrine they doe maintaine. For Constantine required all men to surcease from strife; Till by a gene∣rall Councell all things might be determined according to the word of God, which came out of the East.
Those which are marked in their foreheads are such which are knowen and noted to come forth into publike action; and are calledcap. 7.4. the twelue tribes of Israel, being re∣sembled vnto them which contended with the Cananites for the land of promise. For these also contend with these vnchristian Cananites, for the true doctrine and meanes of saluation promised by Iesus Christ. Those who are sealed according to the doctrine which they keepe; and with which they worship the Lord in the secret of the Almightie,Psal. 91.1. are acap. 7.9.10. multitude which no man could number of all nations, and kindreds and people, and tongues; like holy, and these ascribe all saluation vnto our God that sitteth vpon the throne; and to the Lambe.Euseb. 10. 4. & de vi. Con. 2. 19. For the people late∣ly redeemed from the former persecutions, praysed God the King, and Christ the onely Sauiour. Yea, the Emperors did acknowledge thus much, writing it on pillers to bee read. The seuenth scale open.After the sealing of the seruants of God, followed the emotions which are comprehended in the seuenth seale, which the Lambe openeth. In the declaration whereof, first is set downe the vniuersall disposition of all, to bring into action, and to behold the visions. And this is acap. 8.1. Euseb. vit. Con. 3. 10. 11. graue silence, both in the preparation and expectation of that which should follow. Secondly, the instruments which are to bring about these troubles are seene; and are said to becap. 8.2. seuen Angels with seuen trumpets. For the future alterations were to be wrought by the diuersitie of doctrine and perswasions which should induce men to stirres. In the third place is shewed the principall matter which is to be the argument of the troubles, that these trumpeters should sound, which is concerning the doctrine of the me∣diation of Christ, which while some should labour to main∣taine precisely according to the doctrine of the East, and
others should corrupt; much trouble would arise in the world. The mediation of Iesus Christ, is presented by ancap. 8.3. other Angel differing from the foure Angels which were to holde the windes, as also from the seuen trumpeting Angels. The thing he presenteth, is the readines of Iesus Christ, to make reconciliation betweene God and man. For he stoods before the altar of incense which was before the throne; hauing a gol∣den censor, as theLeuit. 16. priest in the law was prepared to make reconciliation betweene God and the people. By this is signified the readinesEuseb. vit. Con. 3. 13. of Constantine, and all godly Bi∣shops at the Councell of Nicea, to heare with pacience, and to vnderstand in sinceritie, and to iudge with truth the que∣stions and differences which were made in that time. Hereof, first the godly make a good and religious vse; for by them muchcap. 8.3. odors was giuen vnto him,Rom. 12.1. Psal. 141.2. that is, reasona∣ble seruices and petitions; to offer with the prayers of all Saints; that is, that euery man labored for anEuseb. vi. & 3. 16. 18. & 4.36. vnitie and to be made members of the vniuersall Church, as it was re∣quired according to the prescript of the word of God. The effect hereof is an vniuersall reconciliation and peace both in heauen with God, and in earth amongst men, thecap. 8.4. Leuit. 16.2.13. smoke of the odors going vp out of the Angels hand, before the presence of God. For in the Councell of Nicea (whichCaranza. was held, Constantine being Augustus, and Licinius Caesar) there wasEuseb. de vit. Con. 3. 16. diligent enquirie into all things, till there was pro∣nounced a sentence, pleasing and acceptable to God, that beholdeth all things, for the concord and consent of the mindes of men. And that so, that there was nothing (that seemed) leaft to breede any matter of discord, or contro∣uersie of faith. In this Councell wasCaranza f. 37. b. & 39. . acknowledged the ne∣cessitie of confessing the Godhead of Christ, against Arius. As also the heresies of Photinus, Sabellius, &c. were con∣demned.
Againe, when new contentions did arise,cap. 8.5. this Angel filleth his censor full of coales of the altar, readie to make an atonement; but because men now doe not bring odors, but hypocrisie, he casteth the coales into the earth,Rom. 1.21. that is, reiecteth their seruice, and deliuereth them ouer into a re∣probate minde, to doe things not conuenient. For when as the peace of the Church was not sought, but men gaue themselues onely to pretextes of good things; there was great corruption.Socr. 1. 10. 18. 19. 20. For Constantine hauing recalled the Ari∣ans, who had made a very hypocriticall submission; he so farre trusted them, that he committed the hearing and de∣termining of the questions of the time to the discretion of such, which pretended to be Catholickes, but were Arians in heart. And thenEuseb. vit. Con. 4. 40. 43. Massaeus 10. p. 136. 137. Soc. 1. 9. 22. & 4. 18. began it to be esteemed more religion to build certaine places and to pray in them, rather than in others, and to liue by some prescriptions, and will∣worships of Monkes, Eremites, &c. than to walke by Gods word. The effect is, that hereupon arecap. 8.5. made voyces and thun∣drings, and lightnings, and earthquakes; that is, great and very fearefull emotions; both for the matter and manner of them. Here therefore doth the Dragon take the opportunitie to make his purpose appeare. For his Angels doe holde now the foure windes; that is, do bring in an. Thes. 1.11. vniuersall strong delu∣sion, that men should beleeue lyes; that they might be dam∣ned which loue not the truth; which is done by the restraint of the spirit of the truth. By this delusion, he first maketh warrecap. 12.13. against the wo∣man, the Church, which had brought forth a man childe, and after against her seede. In his warre against the woman, by strong delusion he at once persecuteth some, and corrupteth others. In his persecution, he first laboureth to destroy the Church peecemeale, and fayling of his purpose, the second
time endeuoreth to drowne it altogether. In this first battell we are to consider the enemies with their seuerall manner of fight; and the successe. The ene∣mies are the woman, the Church; and the Dragon on earth, that is, the diuel by his deputy. The woman is the selfe same before described in the first battell which was in heauen; namely those Christians which came out of the formercap. 7.14. tribulations, and great persecutions, vnder the heathen Emperors, continuing the faith which was persecuted in the first battell in Saint Iohns time, where∣of some had been marked with an eye put forth, and their hamme cut, to haue stoode against Arius before, and in the Nicene Councell. These are said to be of the twelue Tribes of Israel, that is, by their true profession of the Christian faith, and circumci∣sion of the heart, to beRom. 2.29. truely Iewes. In whom the chil∣dren of Israel are multiplied exceedingly. For first the twelue tribes are multiplied into themselues, and so are 144. and enioying the blessing of thousands,cap. 7.4. &c. are 144,000.Isai. 49.5.18. though Israel according to the flesh be not gathered, but scattered abroad. Now these lie open to affliction, as it was foreshew∣edcap. 6.11. vnto their brethren. For though Constantine didSozo. 1. 7. Euseb. & 10. vit. Con. c. 1. 44. much fauour and honour them that were with him; yet in other prouinces many did beare the brunt of bitter persecution. The Dragons deputie, is the Romane Empire corrupted with heresie, and iscap. 13.1. &c. described by the place from whence he should arise by his monstrous shape and dignitie. He is said to arisecap. 13.1. out of the sea, that is, from amongst people,cap. 17.15. and multitudes, and nations, and tongues; namely all those seuerall nations, ouer whom Constantine did gouerne. As concerning his shape, he is first said tocap. 13.1. haue seuen heads, that is, those seuen hils, and seuen formes of gouernement, euery one blasphemous; of which isSupra. cap. 1. pag. 3. spoken in the descrip∣tion of the Dragon.
He hath alsocap. 13.1. tenne hornes like the Dragon, not onely for the decharchie, &c. as before; but also for tenne kingdomes whichcap. 17.12. should arise afterwards. And whereas the Dragon was crowned on his heads, this beast hath tenne crownes vpon his hornes, to signifie that these hornes should be seuerall kingdomes, hauing regall power in their owne hands. He is bodiedcap. 13.2. like the Pantheresse, whichIsid. Etym. 12.2. is a beast very swift, venturing all dangers,Plini. 8.17. white, spotted with little eyes of blacke, rauenous, beautifull, luxurious, and with her smel, which is odoriferous, sheGerar. dial. crea. 104. allureth other beast vnto her. Footedcap. 13.2. like a Beare; forPlin. 8.15. whereas the Pantheresse, as also the Lyons, doe hide their talants, as they goe or runne, neuer putting them forth, but when they make at their pray; this wilde beast hathIsid. Etym. 12. 2. beares feete, which haue their greatest force in their loynes, and legges, and doe teare the ground as they goe. Hiscap. 13.2. mouth or face is as the mouth of a Lyon; whose ma∣iestie is inCron. 12. 8. Plin. 8.15. his face, taking scorne to looke vpon his ene∣mies or their snares; his mouthIsidor. 12.2. Plin. 8.36. of such force, that where he toucheth with his teeth, he draweth goare blood. For RomeBrought. in Concente. hauing subdued the countries, which in Da∣niel were figured by a Lyon, a Libbard, and a beast with tenne hornes; thereafter is a beast which is a Lyon in mouth, a Lib∣bard in body, and a beast with tenne hornes. He hath also this shape, because the heathenEus. 8.4. &c. Emperors, whom this beast succeedeth in cruelty, vsed especially Lyons, Beares, Libbards and horned beasts, to torment and deuoure the Christian martyres. Now that this wilde beast doth signifie the Emperors, which doe pretend themselues to be Christi∣ans, but oppose themselues against theGobel. aet. 6. cap. 64. p. 233. Church; Pope Gre∣gory the ninth is witnesse in his bull against Fredericke the second Emperor. So that nowProu. 28.15. the wicked ruler is as a roa∣ring Lyon, and hungrie Beare amongst the people. Yea, as a
Hoseah, 13.7.8. Leopard in the way that breaketh the kall of the heart. His Dignitie is the same, which the heathen Romane Em∣pire had, firstcap. 13.2. Power, and abilitie to doe. Secondly, Throne, that is,Iere. 45.10. iurisdiction to giue lawes. Thirdly, Authoritie, that is, reputation, or estimation. For there stepped vp an Em∣pire of Arians, &c pretending to be obedient to Christ, with which all the world was enamoured and followed it, as o∣ther beasts doe the Pantheresse, hoping for great comfort by it. It was strong and sure in marching against his ene∣mies; as a Beare robbed of her whelpes. It was maiesticall in countenance like a Lyon, seeming to deserue much ho∣nor and reuerence. But it proued a meere pretext to kill and to deuoure, luxurious for idolatry, and other false worships, couetous and tearing where it went; most cruell and blou∣dy where it did bite; so that it was like the beast of whichDan. 7.7, 23. Daniel speaketh, that deuoured, brake in peeces, and stam∣ped the residue vnder feete. In a word it became a monster, compounded of three fierce and wilde beasts, whom no art can tame. And although it were in appearance something different from the heathen Empire; yet forGeneb. p. 567. persecution, it was nothing inferiour to it. The manner of the fight is diuers, as are the enemies. The Dragons deputie, the Romane Empire corrupted with heresie; doth foure seuerall times charge the Church, as with the sound of a trumpet. Vpon the sound of the first trumpet,The first trum∣pet. hee chargeth the Church as with a tempest, incap. 8.7. Esay 28.2. Psal. 18.22. Ioel. 2.30. which there was haile and fire mingled with blood, cast into the earth: that is, with bloudy persecutions, in which earthly minded men had the execu∣tion of such punishments which were called the iudge∣ments of God; but were indeede very painefull and vncha∣ritable persecutions.Euseb. 10. 8. Socra. 1. . Melancton. Euseb. vit. Cor. 2.2. For the diuell through enuie and wrath, with which hee was enraged for the peace of the Church: stirred vp Licinius Caesar to persecute the Church.
He pretended that the Christians prayed for Constantine and not for him; but giuing himselfe to heathen idolatrie, sor∣cery, murther, &c. to auenge the cause of the old Romane gods, he with a cruell storme and tempest persecuted the Saints, and kindled a more lamentable flame than the former persecutors did.Haile. He raged against the Christians, souldiers, people, and Bishops. He proclaimed that it was very vnlaw∣full for any subiect, by humanity and pity to relieue those whom the Prince had imprisoned. By these vncharitable courses many poore Christian prisoners were famished. He also caused many of the Christians to be hewen in peeces, and (as butchers vse their meate) to bee hanged vp in the shambles, and after this horrible and vnnaturall spectacle, to be cast into the sea for fishes to feede vpon. But theseSozo. 1. 2. persecutions were onely about Lybia and Aegypte, and not in the rest of the Empire. Constantine also recalled certaineSocrat. 1. 10. &c. Arians from banishment, and receiued them into fauour, when they pretended to repent them of that opinion. And he committed to them the hearing and determining of the iudgements of God, which were supposed to be deseruedly inflicted vpon men, who indeede were vniustly accused. The second Trumpet.When the secondcap. 8.8. Angel had sounded his trumpet, there ariseth a persecution, as if a great mountaine burning with fire, were cast into the sea, that is,Iere. 51.25. the monarchie of the world became enragedIsaiah. 17.12. against his subiects, and a persecutor of the people of God inhabiting neere the sea coasts. This was accomplished when as Constantine by the suggestion of his sister Licinius widow (who was deluded by an Arian priest) called a Councell at Tyrus (a city standing in the sea) a∣gainst Athenasius that defended the faith of the Nicene Creede. Him had the pretended Arian Conuerts, accused to the Emperour of many crimes; and here against him and Macarius were diuers matters obiected, not pertaining to the Nicene Councell, but of supposed murther, sorcery, &c.
purposing by those collaterall accusations and calumniati∣ons to destroy the professors of the truth, and that together with them, the truth it selfe might be abolished.Ann. 33. This Coū∣cell was assembled by the craftie seducements of the Ari∣ansEus. v. c. 4. 43. and thither came certaine from Macedonia, Panonia, Mysia, Persia, Bithynia, Thracia, Cilicia, Cappodocia, Syria, Mesopotamia, Phaenicia, Arabia, Palestina, Aegyptus, Africa, Thebais, and nobles of the Emperours Court. InRuff 1. 11. Soc. 1. 21, 22, 23. Theod. 1. 25, 27, 29, 30. this Councell was Athanasius, &c. falsly accused, in hazzard, by the furie of them which were assembled, to bee torne in peeces; he was there condemned without cause, and by the Emperour was banished, and Arius restored. Yea theVlat. 23. f. 270. Emperour Constantine himselfe became an Arian; and as soone as Constantine was dead, SaporAnn. 342. Sec. 2. 12. king of Persia perse∣cuted the Christians, hee with martyrdome crowned aboue 150. Bishops, besides those of the common people. Present∣ly Constantine theMass. l. 11. Emperour fauouring the blast of Arius heresie, vowed, & laboured violently to bring all the world to Arianisme. To which purpose he held diuers Councels a∣gainst them which maintained the doctrine of the godhead of Christ, agreed vpon at the Nicene Councell. Namely,Mass. Soc. 2. 5. 22. 23. 26. 30. at Constantinople, Antiochia, Syrmia, Nicomedia,Theod. 2. 14. 26. Sozo. 4. 15. 18. Nicea, Arimi∣num, Millaine, Seleucia, and Constantinople: He also enforced his commandement for Arianisme by bloodie persecutions, imprisonments, massacres, treasons, by diuers kinds of tor∣ments and crafty wiles, yea the bodies of the slaine were not suffered to be put into their graues in some places. By his meanes many Bishops bcame Arians, as didTheod 4. 37. Vlphilas the Bishop of the Gothes, who infected that nation with that here∣sie. But this persecution was mst aboutRuff. 1. Soc. 2. 12. Soz. 6. 37. The third tr∣pet. cap. 8. 10. 1. Alexandria, and the rest of the sea coastes in the East. Againe, the Dragon causeth his deputie to sound a third trumpet, and to charge the Church afresh. To this purpose, A starre falleth from heauen: that is, someIsai. 14.12. principall person
falleth from the profession of the Christian faith to heresie, or infidelitie. By this starre, or person enraged, is stirred vp persecution, burning like a torch, that is, cruell and tormen∣ting. The effect whereof is, that the waters are made worme∣wood, whereby many doe die: that is,Amos. 5.7. & 6 12. he did corrupt & make abhorred allIsai. 41.17 18. the comforts of this life, and by name the scriptures and holy writings, making them vnsauerie. This was accomplishedAnn. 365. in Iulian the Apostata. For heGenebr. Socr. 3. 10, 11. &c. Theod. 3. 1. &c. Soz 5. 3. & 16. &c. had bene a publike professor and teacher of the Christian faith; but he became an Apostata & Witch, naming himselfe the Bishop of the Pagans. Though his persecutions were cruell and bloodie, yet was the mischiefe that came by his craft farre greater. For he defiled the waters, bread, meate, fruite, herbs, and whatsoeuer men should eate; yea his money, and statues with such filthy idolatrie, that none could partake in them, but seemed to commit idolatrie. And as he corrupted their outward comforts, so did he the knowledge with which mē should feede and refresh their mindes and soules. He forbad the Christians to keepe any schooles, to beare any armes, & to possesse any Ecclesiasticall goods. HeSoc. 3. 19. also laboured to make the scriptures vile and ridiculous, by imputing vnto them foolish precepts. Namely, that theyCarion. taught volunta∣rie pouertie and basenesse, in suffering wrongs without re∣uenge; both which he said were preiudiciall to a well orde∣red common-wealth. The godly and learned men of the time did answer him by writing,Carion. but with more diligence, than sound confutation. He began in France, and persecuted Eastward. Yet once more he foundeth theThe fourth trumpet. cap. 8.12. fourth trumpet, & char∣geth the Church againe. And now the third part of the Sunne was smitten, and of the moone, and of the starrs, so that the third part of the day did not shine, and likewise the night. That is,Ier. 51.35. with Mat. 5.14. Ruffa. 1. 9. The∣od. 4.13. the Bishops and Ministers, and other principall persons, who were called the Lights of the time, were smitten with perse∣cution.
For when the Gothes had gotten aide against their e∣nemies of the Emperour Valens, they became Arians in to∣ken of their thankfulnesse to Valens. But afterwards they harried booties out of the Empire, to the great molestation of the imperials. Whereupon Valens resoluingAnn. 368. to make warre vpon them, thought good to fortifie himselfe a∣gainst those infidels, by receiuing the sacrament of bap∣tisme. ByRuff. 25. 6. the entreaties and inticements of his wife, he was baptised by an Arian, and tooke a solemne oath to root out all that professed Christ any other way than the Arians did. Wherefore he spoiled Antiochia, Samosetenses, Laodicea, E∣dessa, Alexandria, Cappadocia, and Constantinople, of their Pa∣stors (that gaue them light) sending them to prisons, or to banishment.Socr. 4. 27. Sozo. 6. 14. Theod. 4 12. 13. 16. 19. 22. 24. And in roomes of the Pastors, he sent wolues into the assemblies of the sheepe of Christ. He also sent sol∣diers with cudgels and clubs to beate the people away from the places of their meetings. This persecution began at Con∣stantinople, and from thence was continued Southwards. ThisSoc. 4. 15. Ruff. 2. 9. Valens consulted with the Diuel, to know his succes∣sor. These persecutions were specially but in the East; and by the Emperours that were but as third men in the Empire, Iu∣lian excepted, who yet did onely afflict the East; and there∣fore the mischiefe is said to light but vpon the third part.Theod. 5. 6. The East was onely pestered with the pestilence of Arius, when as the West was in a manner alwaies free from it. And the East seemeth the third part of the Empire, bySoc. 1. 26. & alii. the diui∣ding of the Empire in three by Constātine amongst his three sonnes, Constantius, Constans, and Constantine. The manner of the fight of the woman which had brought forth the man childe, is diuerse, by her selfe, and childe. HerRuff. 2. 5. Soc. 3. 11. selfe keepeth her garments of the profession of Christ. Shee also treadeth still the moone vnder foote. For when Iulian depriued all that would not forsake the Chri∣stian
religion of their honour in his palace, those which with an vpright heart did professe the Christian faith, with a readie minde did put off their ornaments of ciuill honour, and submitted themselues to most cruell torments, rather than they would denie Christ. Shee kept also her crowne. For whereas libertie was often graunted to all others, onlyTheod. 4. 24. those which professed the do∣ctrine of the Apostles were persecuted. Now the godly would not deuiseSoc. 3. 5. 1. Ioh. 1.1.2. any new religion, nor bring any such into the Church; but onely confirme that which from the beginning was prescribed by Ecclesiasticall tradition (that is, was deli∣uered by theTheod. 2. 22.

Here are they known to be, by hauing their fathers name written in their foreheads; that is, they are marked to defend thatIoh. 1.12. Iesus Christ is the sonne of God, and in Christ themselues to be the sonnes of God. By this are signified, the many Councels which the Catholikes held against the Arians which denied the godhead of Christ; asSoc. 2. 16. 19. at Sardis, Ierusalem,& 3.5. Alexandria,Sozo. 6. 12. Tyanis. And also vn∣der Iouianus at Antiochia, where theSoc. 3. 24. most contentious A∣rians did subscribe to the clause of the Nicene Creede, that saith that Christ is of one substance with the Father. There was also one which was an Arian that denied the Godhead of Christ, and a Macedonian that opposed the doctrine of the Holy Ghost, bySoc. 2. 33. 35. name Eustathius, who attempted many things besides the Ecclesiasticall rites and customes. For hee forbad mariage, he taught to abstaine from meates and ma∣riage, whereupon hee separated many from wedlocke that had contracted matrimonie;The ground of priuate masse. and hee perswaded them that detested to come to Church, to haue Communion in their houses. He drew seruants from their masters vnder the pre∣text of godlinesse; he ware the apparell of a Philosopher, & compelled his followers to vse a strange kind of apparell; he forbad any prayers to be made in the houses of such as were married. He commanded the publike praiers (or blessings) and Communion of a Minister that had a wife (which hee lawfully married when he was a lay person) to bee auoided as a horrible sinne, &c. But by a Councell held at Gangris he was depriued of his Episcopall dignitie, and his opinions were accursed. (Yet hence doe the Papists sucke many con∣clusions.) The woman also the Churchcap 12.14. doth betake her selfe to flight from these dangers, and to the woman were giuen two
wings of a great Eagle, that shee might flie from the presence of (the monstrous beast the deputie) of the Serpent. For during the timeEuseb. 10. 8.

Constantius, Athanasius is a fugitiue all the world ouer, there were banished Dionysius, Eusebius, Paulinus Rhodanus, Lucifer, Liberius Bishop of Rome, and Miletus Bishop of Antiochia, whom much people follow∣ed. At that time the face of the Church was ougly to be∣hold, shee was wasted of her owne, one chased, another fled. In the time ofCarion. Iulian, Athanasius and others fled again. The godly and learned fathers fled from answering of the cauils which Iulian deuised and obiected against the scrip∣tures, &c. and betooke themselues to praiers vnto God, to deliuer the Church from so dangerous an enemie. In the time of Valens the Ministers and people were ba∣nished, and did flie. FromRuff. 2. 3.

The like was the condition of the Churches in other places. The successe is the safetie of the Church,cap. 12.14. who fledde for a time, times, and halfe a time; flying not onely now, but also for the most part, till the time of Antichrist. The godly and valiant champions called 144, 000: are also safe, because

For IouianusTheod. 4. 1. refused the Empire, saying he was a Christian; but the souldiers required him not to refuse the Empire, for they would be Christians and he should be the Emperour of Christians. And after the persecutor Valens, Gratian,Soc. 5. 2. &c. and Theodosius, Emperors recalled the Christian exiles, and by lawes autho∣rised the truth. There was also by Theodosius a Councell held atCaranza. Constantinople against heresies: especially the Macedo∣nians that denied the holy Ghost to be God.Socr. 5. 13. 14. Before him the tyrant Maximus fled, notwithstanding the triumphs and rumors which the Arians made to the contrarie.

CHAP. IIII. The fourth period and second battell on earth, in which the Dragon casteth a floud out of his mouth, after the wo∣man flying, and is also the first woe to the inhabitants of the earth. WHen the Dragon had failed in his hope to destroy the Church by his former trumpeters, peece∣meale; (for the Church did rather encrease than was diminished) he now taketh a new course. For being enraged, he laboureth to drowne the Church altogether, albeit with all he bring a lamentable woe vpon such, which are his owne instruments of mischiefe. Of this attempt or battell, are shewed the enemies, their seuerall manner of fight, and the successe. The enemies are the Dragon the Diuell, by forraigne and heathen people; which make incursion vpon the countries of the Church, euen both the imperials, and the visible Church. Of these strangers, is set downe: First, the meanes by which they come abroade; then the kinde of the mis∣chiefe which they doe, and lastly the manner how they hurt. The meanes by which they come abroade, is the Diuell. For the Serpentcap. 12.13. cast out of his mouth water like a flood; that is, by his words sent foorth infinit nationsIsai. 59.19. Ezech. 26.3. Amos. 8.8. after the woman, the Christian Church, that hee might cause her to bee caried away of the flood, being drowned by Gentilisme or other cor∣ruption. To this purpose heThe fifth trumpet. cap 9.1. bloweth the fifth Trumpet against the Church; whereupon a starre falleth from heauen vnto the earth, bringing in such Apostasy into the world, that some principall Christian falleth from the care of heauen, to the
loue of the earth; so desiring to possesse the earth, that he is contented to loose heauen, if that might any thing further his ambition. This was accomplished at the death ofAnno 395. Theodosius the good Emperor; who hadMassaus 21. p. 154. appointed three principall Ge∣nerals of his warres to helpe his sonnes, faithfully to admini∣ster the common-wealth. Ruffinus in the East, Gildo in Afri∣ca, and Stilico in the West. For these three persons vpon the death of their Lord Theodosius, fell from their Christian du∣ty; and sought for the Empire. RuffinusAbb. vrsp. 117. resolued to dis∣place his Lord Arcaedius Emperor of the East, and to take the roome himselfe. Stilico sought to wring the Empire from his maister Honorius Emperor of the West; and to ad∣uance his sonne Eucherius to that dignitie. And Gildo vsur∣ped the Empire in Africa. Their absolute authoritie is said to be that thecap. 9.1. Isai. 22.22. key of the bottomlesse pit was giuen them as a meanes to induce them to this apostasie. The persons hauing power in their hands to let loose as dangerous persons as the diuell himselfe is, if they would. For all the barbarians were to be disposed of by their direction. When they had resolued of this apostasie, which was a sinne neuer heard of before among Christian Princes, they laboured to couer theirIsa. 29.15. & 28.15. drifts with damnable policie, as opening thecap. 9.2. bottomlesse pit, so that there came smoke from thence as the smoke of a great fornace, euen the craft of the Diuell. By their secret and close cariage of things; they did not onely conceale their purpose from men, but also the sunne and the aire were darkened by the smoke of the pit. That is, Christ and his holy Gospell were so obscured, as if the fault had been to be layed vpon the Christian faith, that the times were so troublesome. For whenLud. Ʋiues praef. in Aug. de ciuit. dei. Ruffinus sought for the Empire for himselfe,
and Stilico for his sonne, they both resolued on this aduice, that for perfecting of their ambitions, it was behouefull to raise vp warre; that all things being in confusion by that kinde of tempest, their desires might be the more secret and easilier compassed; the Princes being amased with the terror of warre, graunting any thing to that principall Go∣uernor, that was next to them. For they knew that in peace as in a cleere sky and open weather, the darkenesse of their mindes might easily be discouered and punished. Yea, thereAmb. lib. 5. epist. 31. Aug. de cuit. dei lib. 1. &c. was for this trouble a generall murmuring against Christ and the Gospell, as if these afflictions did be∣fall the Empire, because the heathen gods were abolished, and Christ onely worshipped. Now, out of the smoke came these dangerousGeneb. p. 590. Abb. vrsp. p. 117. 118. enemies. For these protectors by their speeches and letters, powred as a flood all barbarous nations into the Empire. The persons against whom they are brought foorth, are first the woman the Church, formerly described, with her man childe, the 144,000. which attende the Lambe on mount Sion. And these arecap. 9.4. Luc. 21.18.19. Ezech. 17.24. called the grasse of the earth, euery greene thing, and trees, for the glorious royall apparell which they did weare, hauing put on Christ Iesus, and for the fruit∣fulnesse of them, their lips being as a tree of life. Against these did the diuell bring them forth. For Stilico laboured to inuest his sonne Eucherius into the Empire, whoAbb. vrsp. 118. euer of a childe did lay traps to ensnare the Christians. Secondly they were sent forth by the Lord to be a woe to thecap. 3.13. &. 9.4. imperials, which sought to inhabit the earth, though they felt from heauen, to get the possession of it. And these because of their earthly ambitions, &c. are said to be such, which haue not the seale of God in their foreheads, that is, did not openly shew any testimonie that they were the seruants or sonnes of God. The manner of the fight of these strangers iscap. 9.3. fearefull,
they being as a monstrous kinde of vermie, compounded of Locustes and Scorpions, at first in their inundation vexing the world like Locustes, but afterwards those which followed hurt men as Scorpions. For vnto them is giuen power, such as the Scorpions of the earth haue, to hurt. But in their manner of fight, we must marke diligently their diuers procceedings a∣gainst the Church and imperials; and that as they are compa∣red to Locustes and to Scorpions. The formecap. 9.7. of them as Locustes, is that they be innumerable armies of horsemen prepared to battell.Strab. Geog. l. 7. quod. Gog. l. 2. For these nations of the Gothes, as all people in the North were altogether horse∣men, none of them goeth on foote; but both great and smal did vse to ride. Their martiall discipline is to serue vnderCabellicus. Kings, which it ment by that which is said, that on theircap. 9.7. heads were set as it were crownes. For howsoeuer they had no kingdome, yet their heads were calledAbb. vrs. p. 100. Kings. They also are said to haue crownes, because that in the end ofcap. 17.12. these troubles diuers Kings did arise of them.Luc. 9.52. For the faire pretexts which they set vpon their actions, they are said tocap. 9.7. haue faces like the faces of men. For besides that they wereAbb. vrs. of a manly coun∣tenance, they were of a singular humanitie towards all men; insomuch that they were calledStrab. Geo. l. 7. iustissimi populorum, the iustest nation in the world. AndLud. Viues in praefat. Aug. de ciuit. dei. when they came into the Empire they shewed themselues willing to entertaine any reasonable condition of peace, discouering the treasons (of Stilico) which they knew; neither did they violate the peace once concluded, but vpon extreame necessities. And they hadcap 9.8. haire as the haire of women. For the Gothes were called GensVisperg. p. 96. Gent. capillata, The nation with the long haire. For the most part of that countrie people doe weare long haire; and doeQuad. Gg. 2. vse to poll their heads behind; but before of their haire they make two long (trica) tresses, or lockes like vnto our women; which they cast behinde their eares
very amorously. By this kinde of dressing isStrab. 7. p. 205. &c. also ment their effeminate and enticing conditions, and common vse of women. It is further said, that theircap. 9.8. Ioel. 1.6. teeth were as the teeth of Lyons, for the horrible waste that these Locustes doe make.Plin. l. 11. 19. For as the naturall Locustes doe gnaw with their teeth whatsoeuer they light vpon; euen the dores of mens houses sometimes; so did theseAbb. vrs. pag. 102. barbarians, they deuoured all things, as the manner of Locusts is. Their courage is vnconquerable, ascap. 9.9. if they had habergi∣ont or curets like to curets of yron, of the best proofe.Viues praes. in Aug. For they haue a certaine religion, that their soules doe returne to others when they be slaine, after the doctrine of Pythago∣ras; or else are placed in a better roome; or at least that death is better than life; wherefore they are said in their warres to come vp close to the swordes length. It is repor∣tedStrab. Geo. 7. that when their Orators were asked of Alexander the Great what they feared most; they answered, Least the sky should fall vpon their heads. The cause of their audacious resolution isAbb. vrsp. p. 100. attributed to the patronage of Mars, whom they honour. When a Heardsman had found a sword in the ground, with which a beast was wounded as he was grasing; he brought it to Attilas; with this Present he grew so cou∣ragious as if he were made by this sword, supposed to be the sword of Mars, the Prince of the whole world. These people make a fearefull incursion into the Empire, as terribly as thePlin. 11.29. Locustes, that make a noyse with their wings like other fowles, doe seeme to those whose fields they are feared to light vpon.cap. 9.9. Iudg. 4.3.13. Hab. 1.7.8. For the sound of their winges was like the sound of many chariots when many horses runne to battell. They wereƲiues vbi sup. so many that no one land was able to finde them foode, forAbb. vrsp. their countrie is called the shop of nations. And as they were alwayes knowen to be a fierce people (for Alexander would not meddle with them, Caesar auoyded himselfe of them; Pyrrhus abhorred them) so was
their comming into the Empire terrible, bothBergomensi. for the mul∣titude of wagons and horses which they brought with them. For the people did tremble and quake at their com∣ming. These firstAnno. 405. Carian. came into Italy vnder the leading of Rhadagasus in the yeere of the Lord 405. As for the persons against whom they came, they pro∣ceeded diuersly; namely the Church and imperials. As for the Church (God so commaunding) these stran∣gers proclaimed a veryAug. Ciuit. dei lib. 1. cap. 1. Viues sup. strange law. Namely that the soul∣diers should spare the Churches, and all whosoeuer fled to the Churches; and vpon paine of death hurt none of them; as if it hadcap. 94.5. been commaunded that they should not hurt the grasse, &c. but onely those men which haue not the seale of God in their foreheads. TheyGeneb. p. 592. 594. testified that they warred with the Romanes, but not with the Saints, and Apostles of God. For there was in this nation a certaine religion, to respect the worship of God as farre as their knowledge would serue, for which they were calledStrab. 7. p. 205. Godworshippers. Towards the imperials and such which haue not the seale of God in their foreheads, they are permitted to vse more violence, yet with a strange limitation, that they should notcap. 9.5. kill them, but that they should be vexed. For these barbari∣ans proclaimed aBerg. in Ala∣rico. Viues vbi sp. law amongst their souldiers, that as much as was possible, they should abstaine from blood. But as they were, so did some of them acknowledge them∣selues to be the scourge of God, wherefore they harried booties out of all places of the Empire. TheyAnno 410. Carion. besieged Rome,Vis. p. 102. tooke it and spoyled it, scraped all away that could be gotten, like Locustes. This vexation was to the Empire, as the paine that commeth by a Scorpion whenWeckerus Aut. spic. lib. 1. sect. 20. hee hath stung a man. For it bread in them diuers afflictions of hope and feare. For they oftentimes intermitted their furie, and renued it againe vnlooked for. WhilesSab. E. 7. l. 4. the Gothes vexed Italy, the Vandales, Sucues, Alani, with fire and sword, and
rapine doe make ougly waste in France and Spaine. After the Gothes, the Hunnes waste Germanie, France and Italy. After them the Bugiani, Vandales, Eruli, &c. Thecap 9.3.10. manner of their fight as they are Scorpions is with their tayles, their false prophets and wicked religion. For they transfuse their wicked doctrine into the hearts of Chri∣stians; asPlin. 11.5. Scorpions doe their gall or poyson into them whom they hurt. For whereas they held thatStra. 7. religious persons should not marry, and that it was not lawfull to eate flesh; the Christians were willing to make that to be good diuinitie. And whereas they worshipped, not onely as Kings, but also as gods, such religious persons as kept themselues in inaccessible celles; and pretended to bee a∣ble to shew them the secrets of the gods; so that they heldAb. vrs. p. 96. that onely to be safe, that onely to be profitable, that onely to be the matter of their vowes, which was commaunded them by such; the Popes fitted their turnes. For they arro∣gated to themselues, and perswaded these strangers that the Popes and their monkish and other clergie, were the onely counsellors with God. Hereby were the Popes terrible to the fiercest of them, and reuerenced as Gothes priests by that nation. For when AttilasChro. Chro. came to destroy Rome, the Ro∣manes &c. did tremble with horrible feare. But Leo theGeneb. Beugem. Pope affrighted him by a miracle, so that the tyrant obey∣ed the Pope; whereby both Rome and Italy was saued. When AttilasA. Michon. cap. 14. Ʋiues sup. souldiers scoffed at him, and said that Attilas fea∣red none but a Lyon and a wolfe (meaning Pope Leo and Lupus Bishop of Trecas, who likewise preuailed with him to spare that citie) he answered that one in the habite of a cler∣gie man, stoode by Pope Leo with a drawen two edged sword, and shaking it at him, threatned to kill him and to destroy his armie, except he did agree to the Popes request. AndGeneb. p. 608. when Gensericus with his Vandales, came resolued to burne Rome, the same Pope preuailed with him to spare
it. TotilasGreg. dial. lib. 2. 14. 15. also the King of the Gothes went to Benedict the Monke, to try whether the fame of his being a prophet were true or no. This Benedict doth report many stories of the dead, &c. and had rules for his order, to forbeare flesh &c. When Totilas came before the cell, he cast himselfe vpon the ground, and durst not come neere. But when he had heard the reproofe and prediction of Benedict, he was ex∣ceedingly affrighted. And when this Totilas besieged Rome, at the instance of Pelagius the first, whoCaranza. first brought into the masse prayer for the dead (a thing that these barbarians did much hearken after) heGeneb. p. 64. obeyed, andCario. fo. 138. caused both vir∣gins and mens liues, and Church goods to be spared. Againe they are said to hurt with their tayles, because many of those which came afterwards became tyrants, asSabellicus. Abb. vrs. p. 109.

The sound of many waters, is a confused and vndistinct murmuring.Carin. Vpon the incursion of the Gothes by Rhada∣gasus, and Alaricus &c. there was an exceeding great mur∣muring, and complaining euen against Christ the sonne of righteousnesse. For diuers obiected that these calamities be∣fell the Empire because they reiected their ancient heathen gods, and had receiued the doctrine of Christ. Insomuch that Symachus the LieftenantAmb. l. 5. epist. 30.31. of Rome was Legat from the Senate to the Emperor to craue the heathen rites to be resto∣red. Whereunto Ambrose made answere in the name of the Church and Christian Senators. With this error alsoAug. de ciui. dei lib. 1. c. 12. 27. many Christians were infected, which vpon better deliberation were brought to repentance. Many for feare they should
fall into sinne, by the terror or inticements of those tyrants, did stagger in their iudgments, whether they were not best to kill themselues, and so preuent the mischiefe of sinning. As forHist. ant. ex Paulo Diaco. p. 434. example one Dagna a noble woman of Aquileia, when the city was taken by the barbarians, cast herselfe out of a turret into the riuer; least she should be made a scorne by the barbarians and loose her chastity.Aug. de Ciuit. Dei. But against such did Augustine write in his booke de Ciuitate Dei, and stayed many. Some also ranne to the Churches hoping there to be martyred. But what by the law proclaimed, to spare such as escaped to Churches, and what by the godly perswa∣sionscap. 9.6. of learned men, in those dayes men did seeke death and did not finde it, and did desire to die, but death did flie from them. The next voyce which was heard of the Church was ter∣rible as thunder, against her hereticall enemies, which were at this time very many. AugustineDe ciuit. dei lib. 1. confuted them that said that Christ and his Gospel was the cause of these troubles; and proued by good demonstration, that the Empire was spared for Christs sake. TheMelanct. 3. Geneb. p. 589. &c. Arians, Maniches, Nestorians, and Pelagians, were vehemently and publikely confuted, some by Augustine, some by Ierome, and others; the Euty∣chians by Cyril &c. The third voyce was as of harpers harping on their harpes, that is, a most heauenly harmonie, of those which consented together, in the true doctrine of the Christian faith, singing as it were acap. 14.3. new song. Of this song is obserued the place where it was sung, and what manner of vnderstanding it required. The place is said to be beforecap. 14.3. the throne, and before the foure beastes, & before the Elders, that is, in the Church before God the father, the sonne, and the holy Ghost, before the glorious Cherubins, and before the faithfull and holy gouer∣nors of the Church. This doth signifie the good and most Christian Councels which were held before the Lord and his
Angels by the authority of godly and religious Princes, and by the assistance of the faithfull Bishops and Ministers of the word. ForCaranza. vnder Theodosius was held a Councel against the Nestorians. And also the Carthaginian, Mileuitan, and Aurasican Councels were held against the Pelagians. The AffricanMelan. 3. Epist. Aug. Councel wrote vnto Innocentius the Bishop of Rome, and exhorted him that he would also disallow the er∣rors sprung vp at Rome, and would not suffer them to spread any further. Vnder Martianus was held a Councell at Chal∣cedonia against the Eutychians.Geneb. p. 64. In the yeare of Christ 552. was held a Councell at Constantinople against certaine here∣tickes, and to confirme the foure generall Councels. A hea∣uenly harmonie of holy harpers. The song which those Fathers and Councels did sing is somewhat darke to be vnderstood. For no mancap. 14.3. could learne the song but the 144,000, which were bought frō the earth: to wit, those faithfull witnesses which are not earthly minded. For as it is said of some of Augustines latter bookes, that he hath sometimes vnproperMelan. 3. de Eccl post. Vol. 3. speeches, but if they be wel & fa∣uourably iudged of, they containe the very truth: so may it be said of the rest, because the iniquitie of the time enforced them to speake with as little offence to the impietie of men, as possibly might be, &c.

there is the Church. The successe is diuers in the Church and Empire, and also concerning these strangers. By this inundation of these barbarouscap. 13.3. nations, that one head of the beast was as wounded to death by the sword: that is, the Romane Empire in the West was cleane ouerthrowne, rent, and torne.Geneb. p. 609 Germanie, Dacia, Sarmatia, Spaine, Britaine, and France, doe altogether fall away from the Empire, to the vtterMelan. 3. ruine of the Empire.

For after that Rome was spoiled by Alaricus armie in the age of Augu∣stine and Hierome, anon it was wasted by the Vandals within 44. yeares. After that 22. yeares by Odoacer, and his Heruli.

For in AugustulusCarion. f. 143. the Empire of the Augusti in Italie perished and ended. They lost theirSab. E. 8. l. 5. language at Rome.

But the earth helpe the woman, and the earthcap. 12.16. opened her mouth and swallowed vp the flood which the Dragon had cast
out of his mouth: that is, the countries into which these stran∣gers made incursion swallowed them vs. For these strangers did content themselues to be mixed with the naturall inha∣bitantsSael. n. . l. 5. of the countries into which they came. The Gothes which remained in Italie degenerating into the name of I∣talians, in Spaine into Spaniards, leauing onely in diuers pla∣ces some places of their names which keepe their memory. And of them arose certaine kingdomes, bearing the names of the places where they were for the most part. The successe that these strangers found was first that their power was limited. Forcap. 9.5.. their power was to hurt fiue months, that is, an hundred and fiftie yeare. For a monethErasm. Rem. in tab. Prt. according to the account of the Hebrewes, Aegyptians, and Astrono∣mers containeth 30. daies, and so fiue moneths amount to 150. daies, which counting aEzech. 4.6. day for a yeare after the ma∣ner of the scripture, commeth to 150. yeare. For from the time that Rhadagasus first entred, which was inCarion. the yeare 405. vnto theSabel. death of Teias the last of these strangers that afflicted the Empire, which wasGeneb. p. 643 in the yeare 555. is precise∣ly 150. yeare. And though the people did still continue, yet the kingdome, name, power, and Empire of the Gothes were rooted out of Italie. And so in other places this number of 150. yeares is in a manner a fatall limit to such as make in∣cursions into the countries of others. Secondly, they that for 150. yeare could be brought vn∣der no mans power, were in the ende afterwards made the subiects of Antichrist.Strab. 7.

For onely the East was pestered with the pestilence of the Arians. Now are we to proceed to shew what became of thecap. 9.20. remnant; that is, the other two thirds of the Empire. For euen amongst them also was thecap. 7.3. earth hurt, after the seruants of God were sealed. That which is here to be considered, is thecap. 13.11. storie of ano∣ther beast, or kingdome, or principalitie, which is said to a∣rise out of the earth; into whichcap 12.9. the Dragon was cast, and where he deceiuethcap. 20.3. the world. In the storie hereof is set down the rising of the beast, the opposition of the Saints, and the successe. This beast though in many things it bee like the other beast; yet in some doth it differ from that which presented the Romane Empire corrupted with heresie. First, whereas that beast arosecap. 13.1.11. out of the water, to wit, from amongst many nations, this other ariseth out of the earth. Now they are said to bee of the earth, which are so
m earthie, as earthly is opposed to heauenly. So that this beast ariseth out of earthly aduancements, &c. For the West by the protection of Constantine was freed from the perse∣cution of Licinius, and also honoured by him. For first heeRuff. 1. 2. refused to cenure them, esteeming them as gods. AndGeneb. p. 5. after enriched the Church with siluer and gold, departed to Constantinople, and (as some say) gaue the citie of Rome, &c. and princely ornaments to Pope Siluester and his succes∣sors. Which (amongst other testimonies) Genebrard doeth prooue by two Rabbines. TheJdem p. 555. first Abraham Leuita, thus: He (vz. Constantine) wēt out of Rome & gaue it to the Idue∣an Priests, meaning the Popes. The other is Aben Ezra, who testifieth thus, Hee (vz. Constantine) beautified Rome, which was the place of his seate, and left it to that iniquitie which now is called Peter. It seemeth somewhat was done this way, but nothing so much as is pretended. For besides that Valla, aValla contra den. Const. man of singular knowledge, writeth against that treatise which beareth the name of The Donation of Constantine; Volateran theVolat. 23. f. 270. keeper of the Vatican librarie, and so best acquainted with the antiquities of the citie of Rome, doth denie any such donation to be made by Constan∣tine, shewing that it is to be found in no old author, but on∣ly in the Decrees, & that not in their ancient copies. Crant∣ziusCrantz. Met. l. 11. c. 24. p 772 saith the Pope was great, not by the forged donation of Constantine, which neuer was made, but by the bountie of other Princes. But such as it was, the humanitie ofEus. vit. Con. 4. 5. Constan∣tine was abused by the vnsatiable couetousnes and vnspeak∣able dissimulation of such as pretended themselues to bee Christians.Polychr. 4.26. f. 171. From that time forward, because of the great ri∣ches that the Church of Rome had, it was made the more se∣cular, and had more secular businesse than spirituall deuoti∣on; and more pompe and boast outward, than holines with∣in, as it is supposed. It is written that when Constantine had made this gift to the Church, the olde enemie cried openly
in the aire, This day is venome powred into the holy Church. Therefore Ierome in vitis Patrum saith, since the holie Church increased in possessions, it is decreased in vertues. And so the beast riseth out of the earth. He is also said to rise out of the earth for his vnsensible manner of growing. For the things which grow out of the earth are well discerned to haue growen, but the manner how no man seeth. And this is it that the scripture calleth priuily2. Pet. 2.1. bringing of damna∣ble heresies, contrarie to the declaring of the Gospel, which is seene vpon an instant, not onely like a swift horseman, but likeMath. 24.27 lightning, &c. Secondly, hee differeth from the other monster by his hornes, which are not ten, butcap. 13.1.11. cap. 5.6. two, and those like the Lamb which had eies, arrogating to himselfe to be like vnto Christ, representingN.D. Warne∣word. En. 1. c. 2. 11. 6. 7. 8. his power and wisdome vpon earth as his Vi∣car or Viceroy. So that in matters of iurisdiction and spiritual authoritie for gouernment of his Church vpon earth (hee presumeth that) Christ hath left so great power vnto his sub∣stitutes, Peters successor (the Pope of Rome) as he may doe thereby, and in his name and vertue in a certaine sort, what∣soeuer his master and Lord might doe in his Church, if hee were now conuersant amongst vs vpon earth. Thirdly, hee differeth in voice.cap. 13.11. For he speaketh like the Dragon; whereas the other did roare but as a Beare, or Pan∣theresse, or Lyon. He is said to speake like the Dragon for his terror. For it is reported that about theGesu. lib. 5. tower of Babel there dwell great Dragons, whose voice and yelling doeth terrifie men. And when Alexander went into India a Dragon with his terrible noise and hissing did terrifie his whole ar∣mie. By this is meant that the Church of Rome, or the Pope should from henceforth labour to rule by2. Tim. 3.2. cursed speaking and execrations: as also by as bloodie and cruell lawes and interdictions, as euer the heathen persecutors did tyrannize with. For in Nero theAug. de Ciu. Dei. 20. 19. facts of Antichrist were seene. So
that by those courses he should not onely fright other men, but also be terrible to Monarchs and their valiant armies. He is also said to speake like the Dragon, because by the spirit of error he1. Tim. 4.1.3 bringeth in doctrines of diuels forbidding to marrie, and commanding to abstaine from meates, &c. and diuers superstitions, telling men that theyGen. 3.4. shall not die if they transgresse Gods commandements, and haue his par∣don. That for their skinneIob. 2.4. men will blaspheme God.Mat. 4.9. Of∣fering to giue preferments to such as will fall downe and worship him, beeing a1. Kin. 22.22 lying spirit in the mouthes of the Prophets of Kings, &c.cap. 19.20. And for these & such like causes he is called The false prophet that prophesieth lies, &c. But he is like vnto the first monstrous beast in this, that he dothcap. 13.12. exercise the power of the first beast before him, taking vpon him as an Emperor in the time & presence of the Em∣perour: labouring to be as absolute ouer the Clergie as the Emperour is ouer the temporaltie; exempting his Clergie from ciuill iurisdiction.2. Thess. 5.2. Yea exalting himselfe aboue all. Yea he proposeth to himselfe to be Monarch of all, and therefore what euer be his pretext, hee in his priuate drift causeth thecap. 13.12. earth and them that dwell therein to worshippe the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed: that is, to worshippe an Ecclesiasticall Monarch which he laboureth to establish in the roome of the former ciuill Monarchie which was o∣uerthrowen in the West by the former incursions of stran∣gers, and onely healed by the Popes. Thecap. 13.13.14 meanes which he vseth to further these ambitions are great wonders, and deceiptfull in the fight of men, and of the beast; that is, seeming miracles to the Prince and people; howeuer there may be a better and truer construction made of them to be deceipts. These his miracles therefore arecap. 18.23. cal∣led inchauntments wherewith all nations are deceiued.2. Thes. 2.9.10. And this is that of which S. Paul speaketh when he saith of the aduer∣sarie of Christ, Whose comming is by the effectuall working of
Sathan with all power and signes of lying wonders, and in allAug. Ciu. Dei. 20. 19. de∣ceiuablenes of vnrighteousnes. Which are wonders either so seeming when they be but impostures; or else if true, they be the workes of the diuell to gaine credit to the great ene∣mie of the Gospel. Particularly for instance it is said that hecap. 13.13. caused fire to come downe from heauen on the earth in the sight of men; that is, he seemeth to men to cause GodIsa. 9.5. & 37 36. to send downe vengeance from heauen vpon men that doe not re∣spect him, applying all the calamities that befall them that loue him not, to be iudgements of God to reuenge the con∣tempt offered to this beast. The Popes were famous farChro. Chr. mi∣racles when they had once gotten purple. The opposition of the Saints is something, though very small, contenting themselues thatcap. 14.3. they were bought from the earth, hauing nothing to doe with the ambition of this beast, that onely minded how to possesse the earth, wincking at much corruption when they saw it. AboutFasc. Tem. f. 47 b. Frising. Chro. 4. cap. 3. the possessi∣ons of the Church, which the Prelates at this time began to haue, there was often a great contention among the Do∣ctors. Some said it was iust and profitable that the Church should abound in temporalties, and haue earthly honours, others thought not. But the Bishops of Rome accepted of these honours. And they of that Church doe thinke thatGeneb. p. 552 553. it much concerned God in some place to haue a visible Eccle∣siasticall Monarchie, which by diuine authoritie (by causing fire to come downe from heauen vpon men) might restraine, ter∣rifie, smite with lightning, and bring into obedience tyrants, hereticks, schismaticks, &c. Wherefore the Bishops of Rome, which was the chiefe citie in the world, endeauoured to at∣taine vnto that dignitie, and to inrich the Church by all meanes possible. These things will appeare more particular∣ly in the stories of the Popes, wherof doe follow some briefe collections.

Marcus appointedBerg. 9. that no Clergie man might by any meanes be drawne vnto secular businesse.Ann. 334. Hee built two Churches in Rome. Constantine enriched him with many gifts. (The beast doth rise out of the earth.) Iulius reprehended theAnno 341. Chr. Chro. Arians, especially that they cal∣led a Councel at Antiochia without the authoritie of the Pope of Rome, when as without his authority (he said) it nei∣ther ought nor could be. He decreed that whosoeuer suspe∣cted his iudge, might appeale to the seat of Rome, (the Pope) Liberius wasPo r. banished for standing against the Arians:Ann. 35. in the meane while by his Counsell the Clergie of Rome or∣dained Felix Pope.
This Felix proceeded seuerely against the Arians. Where∣fore Constantius the Emperor reconciled Liberius; for he seemed more easie to the Arians. Liberius then being ouer∣come with the griefe of exile, and glad that he was Pope againe, assented and fell into heresie, and subscribedMassaus, 11. there∣to. But Felix and theFasc. Temp. s. 48. b. Catholikes hauing admonished him, and finding him to bee contumacious, cast him out of the Church as an heretike: wherefore Liberius cast Felix out of the Papacie; held the Churches violently, and by strength; so that there was a great persecution of the faithfull, and the Clergie and priests that fauored Felix were slaine in the Churches, and Liberius forbad it not.Vol. 22. And Felix himselfe was slaine as defending the truth. This Felix wasGeneb. p. 574. also re∣ported guiltie of heresie. But such is the force of the Aposto∣licall chaire (saith Genebrard) that it would rather make a martyr than heare an heretike. Here wanteth some helpe to reconcile these popish Chronologers.

For Damasus wrote toCaranza. f. 85. b. Stepha∣nus, and an Archbishop, and to the three Councels of Afri∣ca, that the iudgement of the causes of Bishops, and all mat∣ters of great-importance, may not be determined, but by the authoritie of the Apostolike seate. (Thus did the beast rise out of the earth.) But in1. Conc. Const. can. 1.2. Ca∣ranza. his time it was contrarily decreed, that no Bishop should confound the authoritie of bishoprickes, by intermedling in another diocesse, to dispose of Ecclesia∣sticall causes.

It is said, that to him Ierom wrote, that whosoeuer should blame the faith commended by the Church of Rome should

Siricius the first, ordained thatBerg. 9. priests should be or∣dered onely by Bishops. In his time it was decreed, that euery3. Con. Carth. can. 49. Ecclesiasticall person that purchased any lands, &c. should conferre it vpon the Church. It seemeth that Bishops affected very high titles. For to take downe the pride of such, it was decreed thatIbid. can. 26. no Bishop of the first seate should be called Princeps sacerdotum, or summus sacerdos, but onely the Bishop of the first seate. This PopePlat. Berg. expelled from Ecclesiasticall offices all Cler∣gie men that maried a widow or second wife; and decreedCara. f. 90. b. that no Clergie man should haue knowledge of his wife, because it is written those which dwell in theRom. 8.8. flesh cannot please God. Agreeing herein with the heresies of the Mani∣ches, and superstition of the Gothes, thatStra. 7. p. 205. 206. would haue their religious persons without wiues. But this his decree is con∣trarie to the Gangrene Councell, which accuseth such asD. 30. si qui nuptia. accuse the marriage bed, as a let to the kingdome of heauen. Innocentius the first, (is said to haue) excommunicated theGeneb. Emperor Archadius,Anno. 406. and by his Epistle to haue depri∣ued Eudoxia the Empresse from her dignitie. He as an He∣racleonite decreed thatCaran. f. 15 all persons in their deadly and ex∣treame
sicknesses, should be anoynted with oyle hallowed by Bishops. That priests should iudge of the qualitie of the offence, and penitence of men, and at their discretion dis∣misse them. He instituted the kissing of the Pax, that all men might declare their consent to that which was done. He, after the heresie of thePonet Apol. pag. 105. Cataphrygians and Montanus, who feigned himselfe to be the holy Ghost, ordained that the custome of no Church is to be followed in diuine my∣steries, or doing of things, but onely the Church of Rome. It seemeth hee would haue Rome say, as sometimes Babylon said, IIsai. 47.10. am &c. none else; vnto whom may be said, as to the Cataphrygians, came1. Cor. 14.36. See epist. Ath. 1. in Soc. 2. 29. the word of God from you, or came it to you alone? In his time, Rome was taken by the Gothes. At the instance of the African Councell, he condemned the heresie of Pelagius. Anno 421.Zosimus sentChro. Chro. Faustinus a Bishop to the Councell at Car∣thage, to tell them that nothing ought to be done publikely without the Bishop of Rome. He absoluedFox Marty.

Preten∣ding that the Bishop of Rome had authoritie to commaund, graunted vnto him by the Councell of Nicea. (Thus farre was the beast risen out of the earth.) The African Bishops sent into the East for the originall copies of the Niceau Councel; by which they found the Pope to be an impostor. Where∣upon they doe decree, that he that isCaranza, Com.

Leo the first was of such reputation,Anno 442. that what heFasc. Tem. f. 51. spake was so approued, that it was not lawfull for any to dissent in the least thing. He firstGeneb. p. 558. brought in auricular confession, as he writeth in an Epistle. viz. It shall be sufficient hence∣forth, to shew by secret confession vnto the priest, the guilt of the conscience. (Thus riseth the beast.) He decreed that reuerenceCaranz. f. 143. a. should be giuen to the images or statues of the Saints, in paine of a curse (making way to idolatrie.) He much furthered his affaires by (supposed) miracles, for which he
was famous. It is said, that toPe. de Nat. further the credit of his let∣ters which he sent to the Councell of Calcedon, Saint Peter corrected them in al places, by the prayer, and fasting of the Pope, contrary to the commaundement of God, which very seuerely forbiddeth and condemneth consultation with the dead. He is also said to cut off his owne hand, because when a woman kissed it as he was ministring, he fell into tempta∣tion. But the virgin Mary, at his prayers brought it againe, and recured him; as he himselfe did often report. He also miraculously terrified Attilas with his fierce Hunnes; vnder him RomeMass. 12. p. 164.

And shewed that Emperors ought to put their neckes vnder the feete of the Prelates. So gree∣dy is Gratian the Canonist, to shew that in this Gelasius was to be seene, how the Pope (the beast) was risen vp to great∣nes,
that he bringeth in Gelasius, in his letters toCas. 159. 6. Alius.

The Emperor being angrie, presently thrust the Popes Legats out of the citie, saying he would commaund the Pope and others, and not be commaunded. And (as it is vnderstoode) therefore a little after, all his Princes standing by, that he might be plagued for his wickednesse and pride, he was killed with a stroake of lightening (thus the beast maketh fire to come downe from heauen in the seeming of men.) Anno 524.Iohn the first was sent byPet. de Nat. Theodoricus King of the Gothes to Iustine the Emperor; to perswade him to restore the Ari∣ans, whom Iustine had remoued for their heresie. In his way to Constantinople, lie rode vpon a Ladyes horse which was gentle and easie of pace, but after so great a Bishop had sate vpon him, he would neuer endure a woman vpon his backe. (a foolish miracle) When he came to Constantinople, at the gate in the presence of the Emperor and people, he (is said to haue) restored sight to a blinde man that begged. Where∣fore the Emperor and people receiued him with great reue∣rence. The PopeAb. vrs. p. 109. with many teares craued the Emperor to restore the Arians. The Emperor moued with his teares, graunted his request, and restored the Arians to their autho∣ritie againe.

In his way in the partes of Greece he healed a man that was brought vnto him dumbe and lame, who neuer could speake nor goe (as they say). When his neighbours brought him he asked if they did be∣leeue that hee could cure him: who answered that they ho∣ped he could, by the power of God, and authoritie of Saint Peter. When the Pope had prayed and celebrated Masse, he stretched forth his hand vnto the lame man, who presently arose in the sight of the people. And putting the Hoste into his mouth, had present vse of his tongue by the power of God, and helpe of Saint Peter. Comming therefore to thePet. de Nat. Sabel. f. 152. Ann. 536.

The Empresse dealt with Vigilius for the restoring of her friend Authemius an Eutychian. Vigilius answered, that Pope Siluerius would in no wise consent thereto; but as for himselfe, hee would easily agree, had hee power in his hands (vz. if he were Pope.) The Empresse cau∣sed Siluerius to be remooued, which was done by the sub∣ornation of witnesses that affirmed that Siluerius would de∣liuer the citie of Rome, and Belifarius the Emperours Gene∣rall into the hands of the Gothes.Pet. de Nat.

This multitude is now left to be gouerned by him which is commonly called Antichrist; who was to be reuealed vnto the world presently vpon the taking away of the Empire out of the West; which did withhold the Gospel in the times of the Apostles. As the Apostle saith, He2. Thess. 2.7.8. which now withhol∣deth (the Gospel) shall let (the disclosing of Antichrist) till he be taken out of the way. And then shall the wicked man be reuea∣led, &c.Chrys. in 2. Thess. 2. Hom. 4 Nic. Orem. ex Hierom. q. vlt. ad inquisi. Ja∣nuarii, apud Foxum Martyr p. 412. For when as the Romane (or West) Empire shal bee taken away, then shall Antichrist come.

But when the Empire shal be destroyed, he shall inuade the principalities of the Em∣pire beeing void; and shall indeauour to take vnto himselfe by force the Empire both of God and man.

As also teaching that riches, externall glorie, princely immunitie, & authority should be the onely thing that shee principally laboureth for.

As concerning her name, it is said that it was written in hercap. 17.5. forehead, that is, openly that euery man may read it. Her first name is A mysterie, which word Mysterious is written in the fore part of the Popes Miter or Crowne, to signifie that Poperie was like the learning of theEuseb. Gnostocks, some great mysterie for spirituall signification: as if the (Reg∣na mundi) kingdomes of the world were set vpon his holy head. Her second name iscap. 47.5.

For not onely after Ramulus hither vnder ciuill Princes, but also from hence vnder the
Popes for magnificence, Monarchie, amplitude of domini∣ons, &c. Rome may iustly be compared to Babylon. But this Ecclesiastical Monarchie beginning here is com∣pared to Babel in her first building. For as at the beginning when Babel was built, the Lord confounded theGen. 11.7. language of the builders, that euery one perceiued not anothers languages so was this policie of Romes greatnesse built vp in the time of Antichrist by people of diuers languages, whereof the one vnderstood not the other: namely, the people vnder the tenne kingdomes which did arise vpon the inundation of these strangers. Yea Rome vnderstood not the language of her own religion. For theySabel. En. 8. lib. 5. left off to speake latine at Rome vpon the com∣ming of the Lombards. And the Greeke and the Hebrew grew cleane out of knowledge in a small time: andCaesar bel. Gal. lib. 6. like the Druides they would not suffer their religion to be knowne to the vulgar people. And herein shee is contrarie to the Christian Church, which was built vp by theAct. 2. gift of tōgues, whereby the Teachers speake vnto euery one in his own language. Againe it is called Babylon by comparison of the crueltie which the Babylonians vsed in captiuing the Chri∣stians,Deut. 28.49. speaking to them andIsa. 28.11. teaching them in a strange language, as they did the Iewes. Therefore it is also calledcap. 11.8. Egypt. Thirdly, shee is called That mother, by excellencie the mother of all other Churches, like vnto the Cataphrygians; arrogating to herselfe to be the onely conceiuer and bring∣er forth of the children of the Church. This is a name in which the Church of Rome doth glorie in, wherefore they that follow the Church do call herSab. En. 8.6. in Bonifa. 3. c. Decr. tit. 3. c. 23. the mother, and queene, and mistresse. TheVolat. l. 22. f. 255. a. Bishop of Rome was wont to write him∣selfe the Bishop of the Church of Rome; much better than now (as Volateran thinketh) when he writeth himselfe The Bishop of the Catholike Church. For if the Romane be the Ca∣tholike,
they then seeme to take the honour from that fa∣mous city. But whatsoeuer she thinketh of herselfe, Saint Iohn saith cap. 17.5. that she is the mother of the whoredomes and abhominations of the earth. Which Saint Paul expresseth by the name of2. Thes. 2.3. the man of sinne. For all the heads of the gouernment of Rome were blasphemous, none truely religious, (howsoeuer now and then, very rarely, some godly man was in autho∣ritie.) And in the time of Saint Iohn,See Ruff. Soc. Euseb. &c. all the abhomination and idolatry, which was enforced vpon the Christians, came from Rome. So also from this time forth, Rome standeth cheefely vpon this point, that all nations must receiue the ordinances of the Church, as shee hath conceiued them. Which yet (for the most part) are whoredomes, for supersti∣tion, idolatrie, and abhominable treasons, murthers, adulte∣ries, &c. which she hath conceiued of heretikes, tyrants, and other vngodly persons. Insomuch that there is nothing so abhominable in all the earth, formerly condemned in aun∣cient heretikes, but she is willing to conceiue it, and bring it forth; if it may any wise helpe to further her greatnes. So that Rome is henceforth, an Epitome of all abhominable he∣resies. The beast that she sitteth vpon, and doth beare her vp in this wonderfull pride, is described by his originall, name, and forme. As concerning the place of his originall, he is said tocap. 11.7. & cap. 17.8. as∣cend out of the bottomlesse pit; that is, to arise to the greatnes of Babylon, by the opinion which the world had of him, that as he boasted, so he had great authoritie in the bottomlesse pit, and power (like theLiui. dec. 1. lib. 1. pontifex Maximus of Numa his in∣uenting) to pacifie the spirits in the behalfe of those which were dead. For whereas Pelagius the Pope had brought into the Masse prayer for the dead, out of the corruptions of some former ages; especially seeing the world to stand so much
affected with the Monkes ofSee Gregor. Draba. l. 2. &c. Benedicts institution, tha tooke much vpon them, as though they were able to pro∣fit the dead; this kinde of doctrine of the power that priests had, to doe the dead much good, was brought into the Church; and taught very diligently; and enforced by the lying signes of the apparition of soules that were departed; and diuers pretended reuelations, which the dead comming from the bottomlesse pit should shew vnto the liuing, &c. whereupon the ignorant and foolish world was led captiue to this beast, to make it great by the subiection of many vn∣to this his doctrine of the bottomlesse pit. It may also be said to rise out of the bottomlesse pit,N.D. ans. S. F.H. for the darke and deepe schoole-learning,cap. 2.24. or profoundnes of Sathan which it teacheth; leauing the plaine and easie doctrine of the Scriptures, the more easily to delude the world with difficul∣ties and subtilties. The name of this beast, iscap. 13.14. an image of the beast which was wounded with the sworde, and did liue againe; namely the image of the ciuill monarchie or Empire which was woun∣ded with the sworde of the Gothes, and other strangers; but did liue by meanes of the Papacie. Now because the sinnes of the Arian Princes, Constantine, Constantius, Iulian, and Valens, were the cause why God in his iust iudgement, did make the Empire in the West, and especially in Rome of which they gloried, to be abolished; this beast is the image of the Empire, as it was corrupted with heresie: wherefore this isGeneb. 552. 553. a Monarchie, not ciuill in the hands of Emperors, but Ecclesiasticall, vnder him who hath hornes like the Lambe. For the gouernment of the Church of Rome is cal∣led an Ecclesiasticall Monarchie. ForHist. ant. ex Pom. laet. p. 347 Rome, the very god∣desse of all landes, and queene of all nations, doth seeme to require the seates and Empire both of God and of man∣kinde. And this is thecap. 17.9.10.11. seuenth head, or forme of kingdome or
gouernment of Rome. For in the time of Saint Iohn, the So∣ueraigntie, first of Kings, second Consuls, third Decemuiri, fourth Dictators, fifth Triumuiri, were fallen; one was, name∣ly the Emperors being the sixth; and now the Empire be∣ing wounded to death, steppeth vp this beast, the seuenth. Whereof the Pope standing a while, as a Prince, is an eight, and is one of the seuen, being a member of this beast. As touching the forme of this beast, he is said to hauecap. 17.3. seuen heads and tenne hornes; herein, both like vnto the Dragon, which represented the heathen Empire; and also like the other monstrous beast which represented the pre∣tended Christian Empire, which was corrupted with heresie. And because this is said to be the image of the latter beast, as that was of the Dragon, it is implied that this beast hath also mouthes as Lyons for force and maiestie; body like the Pan∣theresse, for swiftnes, inamouring, deceiuing, and inchaun∣ting such which are to be deluded by her; and feete like vnto Beares feete, for strong and sure marching, and couetousnes &c. And as into the description of thecap. 17.1. other beast, so into this is to be supplied out ofDan. 7.1.7.19. Daniel, that his teeth were of yron and his nayles of brasse, which deuoured brake in peeces, and stampeth the residue vnder feete, euencap. 9.11. Abaddon and Apollyan, and therefore is called by Saint Paul2. Thes. 2.3. the sonne of perdition; wherefore this beast doth beare the image of that which signified the corrupted Empire. So that,See Ruff. Soc. Sozm. Theod. what shif∣ting, periurie, dissimulation,Soc. 8. 13. spreading of false rumors, crueltie, &c. to be found in the stories of the Arian Prin∣ces and Bishops: the same is reuiued in this beast. And whereas this beast, by reason of the number of heads and hornes, is likewise in a manner compared to the Dra∣gon; what superstition, tyrannie, and persecution is found in the stories of the heathen persecutors, the same in his time is reuiued by this beast. And this is the cause, that this beast is called by the k name of the Gentiles. Wherefore
the Pope is theLiui. det. 1. l. 4. Pont. Max. of Numaes deuising vnto whom were committed the ceremonies of diuine seruices and of funerals, with the order to pacifie the spirits, in the behalfe of them which were dead. And so at this time mencap. 17.8. wondered at the beast that was in the time Numa, and is not in the time of Saint Iohn, and yet is and was in the time of Saint Iohn, in title, in the Emperors; who called themselues Pontifices Maximi.

There can no difference be shewed, but that onely the names of the things be changed.

Cap. 1. Hiscap. 17.12. tenne hornes are tenne Kings, or principalities, which in Iohns time had not receiued the kingdome; but did re∣ceiue power as Kings at one houre with the beast; this Monar∣chicall dignitie of the Church of Rome, that is, those tenne
kingdomes, or common-wealths, which arose out of the former inundation of strangers. Furthermore this beast is said tocap. 17.3. bee scarlet coloured, herein differing from the other which was white spotted, little eyes of blacke. For this is red like the Panthers of Sy∣ria, and Africa, or rather like the red Dragon; signifying that this beast hath more authoritie, and is more bloody then were the Arians. Forcap. 18.24. in her is found all the blood that is shed vpon the earth. Thiscap. 17.3. beast is full of names of blasphemies, as a Pantheresse is full of spots. For all manner of persons in this hierarchie, from the greatest to the least, doe open their mouthes to blaspheme, curse, slaunder, lie, scoffe, &c. And as they be euer blasphemous, more or lesse; so they spare no persons nor things. For they blasphemecap. 13.6. God, his name his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heauen, yet were the Arians not so bad; for the beast representing them,cap. 13.1. had names of blasphe∣mies on his heads, onely the Princes, and some chiefe persons being blasphemous; the rest ignorantly religious or not so blasphemous. The other enemie iscap. 12.7. Michael withcap. 6.2. his horsemen; and as he is thecap. 17.14. Lambe; and they that are on his side, called and chose, and faithfull.

As he is the Priest of the Church, he causethcap. 9.13. four An∣gels, or fierce and vnresistable nations, to be loosed against them that dwell vpon the earth. To this purpose first is sounded thecap. 9.13. The sixt Trum∣pet. sixth Trumpet, that is, a sixth kinde of doctrine is brought forth into the world; to wit the doctrine of the bottomlesse pit, which was neuer
heard of in the Church of God before. A doctrine of the Gen∣tiles; henceforth, in some sort common to the papacie with the Mahumetans. But the former heresies they share be∣tweene them thus. What hath been heretically taught a∣gainst the Trinitie, the Mahumetanes take vp. What against pietie, or holines, the popish beast doth embrace. Hereupon is heard a commaundement to loose these Angels; and then the execution of the commaundement doth follow. Of the commaundement, first is shewed the place from whence it came, and then the matter commaunded. As for the place, Saint Iohn saithcap. 9.13. I heard a certaine voyce from the foure hornes of the golden Altar which is before God; meaning that he heard the voyce from Christ Iesus, as he is the high Priest; the Mediator to make reconciliation be∣tweene God and man. For that was signified by theLeuit. 16.16. Heb. 9.24. goul∣den Altar in the Tabernacle. Now because that from hence commeth not an assurance of reconciliation; but a curse; It is an argument that the world had corrupted the doctrine of the reconciliation of Christ, either in his person; or other∣wise by offering their prayers byLeuit. 10.1. strange fire, with the af∣fections of men; as did Nadab and Abihu; or arrogated theNumb. 16.21. priests office, as Chorah, Dathan and Abiram; or making themselues mediators by the merit of their prayers.See Ruff. Soc. Soz. Theod. &c. The doctrine of the person of Christ, had been horribly corrup∣ted in the East, by the Arians, Acatians, Eutychians, Ne∣storians, &c. by reason of which blasphemie, they were so farre from obtaining reconciliation by Iesus Christ; as that contrariwise they had procured a curse and iudgement. So likewise in the West he was made intercessor for the dead; and others also were ioyned with him in the office of inter∣cession, as the virgin Mary, Peter, Paul, &c. as if he himselfe were vnsufficient, &c. which also caused this fearefull curse to be sent vpon the Empire in the West, to vexe it &c.
The matter of the commaundement is,cap. 9.14. that the sixt An∣gel which had the Trumpet, should loose the foure Angels which were bound at the great riuer Euphrates, that is, that those foure nations of the Persians, Saracens, Turkes, or Parthians, and Tartars, or Sarmatians, which were bound, either by league, or affinity, or the strength of the waters, or rockes; neere to the head streame, or fall of the great riuer Euphra∣tes; should be loosed from their bond, by the ministrie of Angels, bringing in new doctrine, so that of friends they should become foes. The execution of this commaundement doth follow, by those foure nations; both ready and fierce. They are said to be ready prepared atcap. 9.15. an houre, at a day, at a moneth, and at a yeere; to wit at euery moment; short and long. Their fiercenes is this, thatcap. 9.16.17.18.19. comming with millions of horsemen, they both by their Generals, and also by their Prophets or teachers, commaund as horrible waste as was made atGen. 19.24. &c Sodom, and Gmrrah, when is was destroyed with fire and brimstone. Their commission is bothcap. 9.15. to kill the third part of the men, and to bringcap. 8.13. a woe vponcap. 9.12.20. the remnant. The third part of men, is the third part of the Empire, as it was deuided amongst three Princes, the sonnes of Con∣stantine. And because in the foure first Trumpets, was men∣tion made of acap. 8. third part, and that in the second Trumpets interpretation there is set downe by name, a catalogue of a third part; the same is to be repeated here. Wherefore it is to be thought, that the Turkes, &c. must abolish the Chri∣stian faith, in these, and these onely countries of the Empire;Euseb. vita Constan. 4. 43. Macedonia, Panomia, and in itSoc. 1. 20. Singidnum, and the cities of them which were called Masi, Mysia, Persia, Bythinia, Thracia, Cilicia, Capadocia, Syria, Mesopotamia, Phaenicia, A∣rabia, Palestina, Aegyptus, Africa, Thebani, which the nobles
of the Emperors court, viz. Constantinople. All these are constrained to blaspheme the trinitie, vnder tyrants, in the same countries, where they sinned against the trinitie vnder the Gospel. The other two thirds of the Empire, called thecap. 9.20.21. remnant must not be killed; but afflicted, for their idolatry, murther, socery, fornication, and theft. As Iesus Christ, the Lambe, iscap. 10.1. King of his Church, he warreth by ciuill Princes, in whom is a liuely type of the glo∣rious kingdome of Christ, possessing both land and sea, in such sort as none can take it from him, his feete being pillers of fire. These ciuill Princescap. 10.2. haue in their hand the little booke open, that is, they doe keepe open the Scriptures, which Anti∣christ doth labour to shut. By these Christ Iesus, both taketh possession of the land and sea; and also deliuereth the word of God, to poore af∣flicted preachers; who renew the preaching of the Gos∣pel, to people, and nations, and tongues, and many kings of the tenne, &c. As Christ is Prophet of the Church, he doth, asEzech. 40.3. Zach. 1. 16. & 2. at the buildings of the Temple, measure the Church of this new building, after this inundation of the strangers. To this purpose, to these of the spirit of Saint Iohn, who was in tri∣bulation,cap. 11.1. is giuen a reede an ordinarie instrument to mea∣sure with. But this reede is said to be like vnto a rod, which is an2. Cor. 11.25. instrument for the punishment of malefactors, and not like the ordinary measuring line; to signifie, that such as would truely measure the Church, should doe it with the rods with which they had been scourged, as malefactors; the true Prophets, from hence being commonly esteemed wicked, and therefore often exposed to tribulation. For now commeth the time, of which Christ spake when he said,Io. 16.8. they that kill you shall thinke they doe God good seruice.
cap. 11.1.2. In this measure hee meateth the Temple of God, and the Al∣tar, and them that worship therein; but casteth out the vtter court, which also the scripture calleth The temple in which Antichrist doth raigne. The speech is taken from the Temple which1. King. 6.1. &c. king Salo∣mon built, which was deuided into three parts. First the holy, and holiest places, called by excellencie The temple, & con∣tained the Arke, the Altar of incense, the lampes, and tables of shew bread; all which were couered. Secondly there was the open place, in which was placed the lauer or sea, and the altar of burnt offerings. The third part was called the2. Chro. 4.9. Courts, and was deuided into2. Chr. 6.13. Ezech. 44.19. the inner court, which was for the Priests; and the vtter court where the King, and Priests, and Prophets, and people did assemble for the seruice of God, for instruction,Psal. 122.4.5 Deut. 17.8. and for iudgement in doubtfull causes; ciuil and diuine. The doctrine figuredcap. 11.2. in the Temple and altar, which are continued in the profession of the Gospel, are to be measu∣red and esteemed holy and good, though by Antichrist shut vp, and blasphemed. But that which was represented by the vtter Court, namely the publike assemblies, for that which is called the seruice of God; their courts of iurisdiction, as farre as concerneth the causes of the Lord; the Angell comman∣deth S. Iohn to cast out, and all holy men to count them com∣mon and vncleane. The reason whereof is, thatJoseph. anti. lib 12. c. 6. 1. Macc. 1. as the tem∣ple of the Iews was deliuered into the hāds of Antiochus E∣piphanes; so by the temeritie and ignorance of Princes, the courts are giuen to such as for their manner of rites are butcap. 11.2. the Gentiles in effect, though in appearance like theSoc. 1. 17. Ma∣niches, they seeme Christians. The manner of their behauiour here, is not to rule with the key of knowledge,Dan. 8. but to de∣uoure, break in peeces, stamp and tread the residue of the holy city vnder foot, as Abaddō the son of perdition. And although the Papacie from hence forth corrupteth all assemblies with the tyrannies and superstitions of the Gentiles, and abhomi∣nations
of condemned heretickes; yet doth2. Thess. 2.4. August. de ciu. lib. 20. cap. 19. this Man of Sinne here exalt himselfe, as (if) himselfe were the temple of God, and take to himselfe whatsoeuer was figured by the temple of Salomon, and his kingly pallace. Howbeit in these courts shall bee euer found two witnesses raised vp by the Lord, euen a competent number to stablish a truth; who shall prophesie, by teaching, and cōmination, cloathed in sacke∣cloath, poore, humble,2. Macc. 2.7.14. and sorrowfull to see the abhomi∣nations and blasphemies in the Church, by the Gentiles, &c. Among such therefore is now the Church to bee sought for. These by theircap. 11.4. &c. 10. testimonie must vexe the inhabitants of the earth, both by bringing the graces of the spirit of God vpon good men; and therefore are said to be two Oliue trees, and also to giue holy light vnto them to direct them to the Lord; and therefore are called two golden candlesticks stan∣ding before the God of the earth: and by bringing heauie affli∣ction vpon such as will iniurie them in their prophecie. (For their word shall be as fire out of their mouthes to deuoure their aduersaries. And beeing equall in the power of their mini∣strie with Elias shall be able to shut the heauens, that it raine not in the daies of their prophesie; and beeing like vnto Moses in Egypt, haue power to smite the earth with all manner of plagues, as oft as they will: so that the earth is plagued because the witnesses of Christ are despised and persecuted. Yea those two witnesses (called also 144, 000. of those which haue the testimonie of Iesus Christ and keep the comman∣dements of God) oppose themselues in the open courts of the temple, called now the visible Monarchie of the Church, a∣gainst the beast; bycap. 14.4.6.8.9.15.18. innocencie, preaching, iudgements, & praier. The manner of the womans sitting vpon this scarlet coloured beast, is, to tread the holy citie vnder foote. Yea shee excel∣leth her selfe in cruelty. For while shee was borne vp by hea∣then
Emperours, shee was furious and bloodie, and therein as terrible and odious as a red Dragon. But now shee cloath∣eth her selfe with blood as withcap. 17.4.6. purple and scarlet, thinking it her honour, for the seruice of God to kill the godly. And herein shee is so vnsatiable, that shee is drunken with the blood of the Saints, and with the blood of the Martyrs of Iesus, & that in admirable manner. For shee doth not content her selfe to kill those that stand against her, but also condem∣neth their memorie,cap. 11.7.9. not suffering them to be put in monu∣ments. And though these things, to such as are of the spirit of S. Iohn, doe euer appeare; yet outwardly shee seemeth first to make plentifull prouision for this kind of warre: and then she ioyneth battell with the Lambecap. 11.7.9. and those that follow him. And these things doth this beast accomplish with his won∣ted lying signes and miracles, with false prophesie and o∣ther impostures. For the more effectuall executing of thecap. 12.17. wrath of the Dragon (which affection hee putteth on in all his oppositi∣ons) the beast prouideth himselfe with thecap. 13.3. &c. wonderfull fa∣uour and dependance of the whole earth, which is called by the name of Christian; as also studieth out a most secure dis∣cipline. The world is saidcap. 13.3. to wonder, greatly admiring the beast, the Papacie, by whose meanes the wounded head of Rome recouered life in the Hierarchie. And also they followed the beast, which was like the Pan∣theresse. For as whenGerard. dial. creas. 114. the Panther which is a beautifull and gentle beast, amongst other wilde and rauenous beasts, doth wake, and come out of his denne and roare; other beasts which heare his voice, doe gather themselues togi∣ther and follow the sweetnesse of his odour which com∣meth forth of his mouth: so also when this Papacie, who is beautifull as an harlot, and gentle as Absolom amongst men,
doth speake (though it bee like the Dragon) all men doe ga∣ther themselues together, and followe the words of his mouth, which seeme pleasant to those which are deluded. For from this time, those which before were calledcap. 9.3.11. Locust-scorpions, haue set ouer them a king, the Popes, the angel of the bottomlesse pit. For those kingdomes which rose of the inun∣dation of the Barbarians one after another, began to giue re∣spect to the Bishops of Rome.cap. 17.17.2. Thess. 2.11. For God hath put in their hearts to fulfill his decree, and to bee of one consent, and to giue their kingdomes vnto the beast, vntill the wordes of God be fulfil∣led: and then to hate her. The fauour that this beast found was so great, that the people vnder these tenne kings or principalities, were con∣tented by his meanes, euencap. 13.4. to worship the Dragon the di∣uell: that is, to become as very idolaters (for the worship of idols is the worship of diuels) as thoseƲolat. l. 25. fol. 300. Gentils which wor∣shipped Dragons in the temples of Apollo and Iuno. Forcap. 13.2. 2. Thes. 2.9. the Dragon the diuell gaue power to this beast, howsoe∣uer he pretended to haue his power from Christ, by the means of S. Peter.cap. 13.5. cap. 11.2. The continuance of this battell is 42. moneths, which af∣ter the account of theOrig. Ephe. Astronomers, at 30. daies the month is a thousand two hundred and sixtie daies: that is, according to the vsuall Propheticall account, 1260. yeares, called afterBrought. in Dan. 12. cap. 12.14. the Greeks Astronomers, A time, times, and halfe a time: that is, as many yeares as the Astronomers doe measure by an E∣quinoctiall (which they call a time) two equinoctials, and halfe an Equinoctial; which commeth to 1260. Iulian yeres. This is that time during which the woman the Church is in the wildernesse, whereas the great whore doth sit vpon the scar∣let coloured beast beeing hidden among them that follow Anti∣christ; yet kept from the presence of the serpent. This time also is thecap. 11.2. courts of the temple, that is, the publike face of religi∣on is troden vnder foote by these Antichristian Gentiles; at
least in some place. And these also are the last of theseDan. 8.14. N.B.Da. 8.1. two thousand and three hundreth yeares, spoken of by Daniel, which beganne in the third yeare of Belshazzar, which wasBrough. Con∣cent. 480. yeares before the birth of Christ. And this 42. months or 1260. yeares, is to begin in the Papacie of Pelagius 1. An∣no Christi 560. who brought in the fained superstitions of the Gentiles into the Church; so that they ende 1820. All these things will appeare in histories following. The Complement. In the time of Pelagius, who, as an Angel of the bottom∣lesse pit, brought newes into the world, that as it was among the Gentiles a thing much beleeued; so it was true among the Christians, that the liuing were able to helpe the dead by Masses, &c.Ann. 560.

to rule by Patricij, for the deadly wound of the beast was hea∣led. Geneb p. 645The office of the Exarchie of Rauenna was instituted; his office it was to confirme the election of the Pope of Rome: Michaels red horse caused that Italie was afflicted with ma∣ny slaughters by the irruption of the Barbarians, the Sueui in Galatia are conuerted from Arianisme.

Soz. 3. 17. These two did contend betweene themselues, not for religion, but for primacie, by the ouer∣much desire of honour, with which their mindes were who∣ly possessed.

Whereas be∣fore time there were no other titles in the Church, but Priests and chiefe Priests: Gregorie first deuided them into Patriarkes and Archbishops,Dist. 21. De∣crots. which difference was brought in chiefly by the Gentiles, who had Flamines and Archflami∣nes, &c.Melanct. He increased two pernicious things in the Church, concerning (the bottomlesse pit) inuocation of the dead,Libro dialog. and praier to the dead.Dial. lib. 4. c. 31. 35. 36. 37 51. 55. 58. &c. He first digested in a booke, and commē∣ded to the Church by many deceitfull miracles and reuelati∣ons; to further the new doctrine, which they say is found out of the state of the dead. Herein trusting the reports of some which heard the things reported by others, that some came from the dead. Hereby the Poets fables become good diuinitie; it beeing now acknowledged that the riuer Ache∣rou is in hell, where also a iudge sitteth like Minos, Eachus, and Radamanthus; purgatorie in Aetna, and in bathes, &c. that the dead might be holpen by masses, burials in Church∣es, praiers of Monkes, and Priests.Lib. dial. 4. cap. 41. The reason which hee rendreth why so many things are now discouered of the soules of dead men, which hitherto lay hidde, is, that the end of the world is at hand, and as it were in fight. Take2. Thes 2.1. Luk. 21.8. Isaiah 47.10. heads and be not deceiued, for many will come in my name and say, I am, and the time draweth neere, follow ye not them therefore. In this booke is deliuered this doctrine. AsDial. 4. c. 5. the soule is knowne to liue in the bodie by the motion of the members; so the life of the soule of the Saints, when it is out of the bodie, is to be esteemed by the vertue of miracles. Andibid. c. 20. that the merit of the soule some∣times

He instituted theGeneb. p. 660. worship of the crosse, barefoote on good friday, and remitted canonicall pe∣nance; and promisedPoly. inuent. 8.1. cleane remission of sinnes, to such as frequented Churches on set dayes (that men might be allured to worship the Dragon.)

WhichLib. 11.

And as the forerunner of Anti∣christ wrote to Leontia, to make especially S. Peter the pro∣tector and patrone of the Empire in earth; and intercessor in heauen (meaning that the Bishop of Rome should be in greatest estimation) (for the beast riseth out of the earth) This Pope like theAng. har. 46.

He causedVolat. lib. 22. f. 251. the auncient monuments in Rome, to be cast into Tiber; least by their beautie, they should distract men, from the religion newly instituted. In hisAug. Curie. l. 1 Geneb. p. 655. time Mahomet doth openly professe himselfe the onely Pro∣phet of God; and that whosoeuer durst gainesay his law, should be slaine.

So in the West, theGeneb. p. 661. Lombards, English, Spaniards, Venetians, Ligurians, &c. re∣ceiued the faith of the Church of Rome, and followed her. This PopeBeda. Eccl. hist. l. 1. cap. 25.27. sent Augustine into England, to conuert the English men. They which were sent (like those that built
Babel) neither vnderstoode the Scriptures, nor the language of the people. The first point of religion which they shewed was this. They spread forth a banner with a painted cru∣cifixe, and so came in procession to the King, singing the Letanie in a strange tongue, and shewing some (deceitfull) miracles. He laboured to reduce the whole land to the ex∣ample of Rome, as Montanus did all Churches to Pepuza, &c; and therefore became enemie to the seuen Churches of the Britones, who followed the custome of the East Chur∣ches; and would not submit themselues to his pride, but (cast him out and measured him not as a man of God) because he learned not of Christ to beare his yoke. who was humble and meeke. He wrote to Augustine,Bed. eccl. hist. l. 2. c. 2. dis. 15. 4. deni{que}. that the Clergie should in quinquagesima, abstaine from flesh, milke, meates, and egges, whichAugust. de haeres. 46. meates the Manachies electi or priests forbare.

CHAP. VII. Of the blasphemie of the scarlet coloured beast, and woman thereon; and first how they are blasphemous in their owne persons. THe beast hauing attained vnto this great power, and dependance, abuseth his authoritie of speak∣ing to blaspheme; and his power of doing vnto tyrannie. For it is said hecap. 13.6.7. therefore opened his mouth vnto blasphemie, and to make warre with the Saints. He is blasphemous euery way; and that first in respect of his owne conuersation, which henceforth is very flagitious. For from this time the Popes doe grow to such wickednes, and impietie, as was neuer heard the like; no not in Simon Magus or his posteritie. Secondly he is blasphemous in his doctrine; and that con∣cerning God and his worship. Simon Magus was noted for a singular blasphemer, that durst affirmeAct. 8.9. of himselfe, that he himselfe was some great man; but the Popes like the Prince of Tyrus hath his heart exalted, and saith. I am aEzech. 28.2. god, I sit in the seate of God, in the mids of the sea, the multitude of people. Yea, he thinketh in his heart tha the is equall with God:2. Thes. 2.4. Aug. ciuit. d 20. 19. For he exalteth himselfe a∣gainst all that is called God, or that is worshipped, so that he doth sit as God, and as if he were the Temple and Church of God. And now poperie being an absolute complement of all abhominable heresies, that can be brought to any tolerable appearance,cap. 13.6. doth blaspheme God, his name, his Tabernacle, and them that dwell in heauen. For now is come into the world,2. Tim. 3.2. that perilous time in which men become cursed speakers. And vnto their blasphemie they adde the persecu∣tion of the Saints. These things are to be marked as they fol∣low
in the stories at seuerall times. They are said to blaspheme the name ofMand. 3. God, which dire∣ctly commit blasphemie against the person of the Godhead, or else blaspheme any persons or things, vpon which God is named: wherefore the name of God is blasphemed, when Princes are blasphemed; seeing that vnto them, the LordExod. 22.28. Psal. 81.1. hath communicated his owne name. Those doe blaspheme his Tabernacle, which speake euillAct. 7.44. &c. 2. King. 18.30, 35. of the place where God is worshipped, according to his owne ordinance; and the worship which God hath appoin∣ted in his word, and Sacraments; or whereIere. 7.4.10.11.12. that is ascribed vnto his Church, which he neuer gaue vnto it; as to exalt it or any person thereof to a greater place then to be obedient vnto his word. They which dwell in heauen are blasphemed, when that which is proper to God, is ascribed vnto them; as to be pa∣trones, illuminers, mediators, &c. or anyPsal. 74.12. Isai. 42.3. helpers of those which are below;Gal. 1.8. when Angels are made preachers of a new Gospel, or receiuers ofCol 2.18. worships; and the Saints de∣partedLuk. 16.24.26. are supposed to ease those in hell, &c. especially, when they are reported to further the ambition and malice of men, &c. These and such like blasphemies is this beast guiltie of, from this time forth. The opposition of the Lambe doth still continue, killingcap. 9.15. of the third part of men; and bringing a was vpon the rem∣nant, by the foure Angels, which are loosed from Euphrates. Ascap. 10.2. also Christ the King by Princes doth still hold open the booke of the Gospel, and set his foote vpon the land and sea, as proprietary and true owner of both country and people. And because the beast doth labour, not onely to exemptcap. 13.12.14. himselfe from the subiection of Christ, in the ministery of Princes; but doth also arrogate to himselfe to becap. 18.7. cap. 12. Lord of the earth and sea, the Lambe that iscap. 7.17. in the throne, in the person of Princes, doth firstcap. 10.2. set his right foote vpon the sea,
that is, he taketh possession of the people, with great force and violence; and his left foote vpon the earth; that is, posses∣seth the earth. And becausecap. 10.1. his feete are pillers, his posses∣sions is sure; and because these pillars be of fire, heZach. 12.6. con∣sumeth them as stubble that will offer to take any thing from vnder his feete. Secondly, hecap. 10.3. cryed with a loud voyce, as when a Lyon roareth, that is, indignation doth proclaime, and decree seuere lawes, to bring all, both the people and the Popes into obedience; and to keep them in subiection.Pro. 19 1. & 20.2. Hol. 11. 10. For the wrath of a King is as the roaring of a Lyon. And in this phrase doth Fredericke the second, expresseGebel a. 6. cap. 64. his con∣ceiued displeasure against the Pope, that would not onely exempt himselfe from subiection to the Emperor; but ∣sult as Lord ouer the ciuill authoritie. The opposition of Christ in his witnesses, is as before, to propheciecap. 11.4. in sackecloth, like poore professors to accom∣panie thecap. 14.1.3.4.

For the Emperor would not loose the right of the Empire. This seemeth to prooue the grauntDist. 63 Ego Ludouicus. of Ludouicus to be a meete forgerie.

The Pope fortified the ruined city of Ostia, against the Saracens, and commaunded the name thereof to be Gregoriopolis, but after the Popes death it lost this new name. The Emperor Ludouicus heldPlat. f. 127. a Councell of many Bishops, to the honor of God, and profit of the Ecclesiasticall dignitie. In which was decreed, that neither the Bishop nor the Clergie of any
degree should weare any precious and costly garments, silkes, scarlets, or embroderies, nor any golde or siluer on their girdles or slippers, nor vseFox Mary. pag. 138. diceing, nor keepe harlots nor great horses.

Anno 844.Swines snowte, forCarain f. 334. & alij. the deformitie of his name, changed it to Sergius the second. Hence the Popes began the cu∣stome to change their names. As if hePoly. Jri. 4. 7. be a malefactor, he may call himselfe Bonifacius; if a coward, he may be called Leo; for a carter Vrbanus; for a cruell man, Clemens. This Pope was createdGobel. ae. 6. cap. 45. p. 197. without the consent of the Emperor, but the Emperor sending a mightie armie against Rome (setting his fiery feete on the sea and land, and roring as a Lyon) compelled the Romanes to sweare alleagance vnto the Emperor. And after vpon diuers conditions, confirmed Pope Sergius. In this Popes time, the brother of this Pope, vsurped Ecclesia∣sticall authoritie, being a lay man. Simonie was so common, that euen Bishoprickes were solde to him that would giue most. And because there was no Christian that would cor∣rect these euils; God sent his whip the Paganes, to reuenge the sinnes of the Christians. The Saracens came and killed innumerable people, and burned many cities. A horribleFasc. Temp. f. 66. a. plague is vpon Rome, and all Italy.

Anno 847.Leo the fourth,Platina. praying (blasphemously) through the me∣rits of Peter and Paul, fought in person against the Saracens; and miraculously drowned them in the sea. He decreed that a2 q. 5. Nullam. Bishop should not be condemned vnder seauentie two witnesses. He forbadGeneb. p. 776. the laytie to come into the quire,
while the Priest was at Masse. In his time the Arabians rai∣sed three persecutions against the Christians in Spaine. Theo∣dora (the Empresse of Constantinople) commaunded images to be set vp againe. The nauie of the Arabians ouercame the nauies of Venice and Constantinople; inuaded Dalmata, tooke the iland Lipara, and doe much hurt to the Empire; wasting the Cyclades &c.

Emperour was departed, the women, many in number, and not altogether vnnoble, who had bene harlots to this Pope Iohn; perswade the Romanes to recall Iohn, who vpon his returne committed many outrages.

The decree of taking from the Romans libertie to choose the Pope, was the cause of such troubles and emotions that weakened both the Em∣perours and Empire.

When there was no bishop of Germanie that would be set ouer the poisoners of Italie; hee sent an Aleman to take the place, named afterwards Leo the ninth. Thus are the Popes become a blasphemous beast; and are so farre from repenting themselues of their idolatrie, murther, sorcerie, fornication, &c. that for these things the Angels a∣bout
the riuer Euphrates doe by the reuenging hand of God bring a lamentable woe vnto them; and ciuil Princes doe set their fierie feete vpon them. CHAP. VIII. How when the Emperours had roared as a lyon, the beast crieth them downe with 7. thunders; blaspheming Princes, and making warre against the Saints: with his victorie. HItherto the beast, the Popes, haue opened their mouthes to blasphemie; beeing blasphemous in do∣ctrine and behauiour, both in word and deed pro∣digious monsters. Hitherto also the Lord Iesus by the Em∣perours, as by an angell in a cloud, &c. hath taken possession of the people by violence; and of the soile, by force and au∣thoritie. He also by seuere lawes had (as it were) cried, as when a Lyon roareth, threatning their destruction that would offer to exclude him from any part of that his possession. It now followeth hereupon, to consider how the beast behaueth himselfe in his manner of fight. And this is contai∣ned incap. 10.3. seauen blasphemous thunders that doe vtter their voi∣ces, andcap. 13.6. in other blasphemies and warres against the Saints, &c. By the voices of thunders are vnderstood such strong de∣clamations, which doe breed as fearefull emotions and pe∣rill among men, as a violent storme doth in the aire; & doth terrifie men, and beat them from their places, as if they were stroken with thunderbolts. The Popes and suchGeneb. in Siluest. 1. & Pio 5. & alii. as follow them, delight to call the Popes execrations, excommunica∣tions, and proscriptions, by the name of thunders, as Fulmen papale. Wherefore these thunders doe signifie such troubles,
as came vpon the Empire by the Popes excommunications and execrations, &c. These thunders are said to becap. 10.3.4. 7. in number. For howsoe∣euer the Popes did excommunicate more than 7. Empe∣rors; yet did they preuaile to hurt and remooue or subdue but seauen.Curio. f. 198. b All these were excommunicated in order by the Popes, when as they were most mightie Caesars, and very couragious, and accomplished great and excellent affaires. 1. Henricus the fourth: 2. Henricus the fift: 3. Fridericus the first: 4. Philippus: 5. Otho the fourth: 6. Fridericus the second: 7. Conradus. The rest despised, or escaped the danger. Besides blasphemous thunders, whereby godly Princes be terrified; the beast doth proceede tocap. 13.6. blaspheme the taber∣nacle of God, that is, that very worship of God, which isHeb. 8.5. Exod. 25.40. ac∣cording to Gods own ordinance and word, is accused to be heresie, filthinesse, sedition, rebellion, &c. Like as the wickedEus. 3.17. & 4. 7. & 9.5.7. heathen, and hereticks haue done, whose steppes this beast doth follow. He also doth blaspheme themcap. 13.6. that dwell in heauen, that is, such which are truly faithfull professors of the Gospell of the kingdome of heauen, hauing theirPhil. 3.20. conuersation and affections in heauen. Vnto these are many fowle and hor∣rible crimes obiected, if they be any way opposite to their vnrighteousnes, or vngodlines. And herein they follow the Arians,Ruff. 1. 17. Theod. 1. 25. 27. 19. Soc. 2. 21. &c. that blasphemed Athanasius, Macarius, &c. which were enemies to their heresie and crueltie. This is a good warrant to vs to thinke, that when the Popes doe curse Princes and their clients, in their iudiciall procee∣dings, and written bookes, doe impute many impieties and euils to those, that by the profession of the Gospell are their aduersaries; these reproofes are but causeles reproaches, blasphemies, slaunders and lies. So that still in them, the diuell doth accuse the brethren, as he did in the times of the heathen Emperors, and Arian heretikes.
He doth also abuse the great authoritie which is giuen him, tocap. 13.7. Make warre with the saints: namely, both by per∣secutions, when they doe submit themselues; and by armes when they stand for their liues. Herein following the hea∣then Emperors, andTheod. 2. 14. Soc. 2. 22. 23. 30. Eus. 15. 1. Arian Princes whose image they be. The seueritie of discipline which he hath found out, is in cruell lawes of confiscation of life and goods. To this purpose, firstcap. 13.15. is giuen to him (the Pope that false Prophet) to giue life vnto the image of the beast, the popish ec∣clesiasticall Monarchie, in the hands of Bishops, and popish Princes: for vnto this time, the Papacie was subiect to Prin∣ces, and for their lewde conditions were so seuerely kept in awe that they were but dead hearted. But henceforth, they by the Popes meanes take vnto themselues stoute stomacks. And by their stoutnes get powercap. 13.15. that the image of the beast (the popish Hierarchie) should speake and make such lawes, as vnder which, both Prince and people should bee sub∣iect. Their first lawe is confiscation of life; toIbid. cause that as many as would not worship the beast (the popish ecclesiasticall Monarchie) should be killed. By this it appeareth, that how∣soeuer by any necessitie the Papists doe promise and sweare peace, obedience and subiection to Princes; or giue faith and safe conduct to others; yet the resolution concluded vpon, and drifted is, when time and place shall serue, after the example ofCurio. lib. 1. Mahomet, by all manner of meanes, to kill Prince and people, that are any impediment to their reli∣gion or tyrannie. For this is a monster, compounded of three such beasts, as cannot be tamed by any arte of man. Yea, the manner of their killing is beastlike: for as they fill their bellies, gase on the rest, and doe not suffer any thing of their pray to lye hid in the earth: No more doth this popish beast suffer them that they haue slaine to be put incap. 11.9. graues nor any moniments; but gase, and stare vpon them, exposing them
to all men as an vnnaturall spectacle: contrarie to the holy captaine Ioshuah,Iosh. 8.29. and 10 27. who,Deut. 21.23 according to the lawe, would not haue his enemies hang any longer than sunset, and then cast heapes of stones vpon them for a memoriall. The second lawe is confiscation of goods,cap. 13.17. that no man might buie or sell saue he that hath one of his three priuiledges: which are these; first, The marke of the beast: secondly, The name of the beast: thirdly, The number of his name.Polychronicon lib. 4. cap. 25. Such kinde of lawes made the heathen persecutors, against those Christians that refused their superstitions. A marke or character doth signifie such signatures as men vse to brandonColumella lib. 11. cap. 1. distinguish sortes of beasts, from another, or a mans owne from other mens.Geneb  8 737. Such doe the Mahume∣tanes vse to set vpon men. The Papists haue many sorts of them, as crosses, granae benedicta, holy water, chrisme, and di∣uers other such superstitious signioles. By many of them, they distinguish (as with a brand) their faction from others. Herein they follow the steps of theSozom. 7. 17 Arians, whose image they be: for they vsed secret markes in their letters, when they seriously commended any to be receiued into com∣munion amongst them. Of this marke it is said particularlie, thatcap. 13.16. he (namely the Popish ecclesiasticall Hierarchie) made all, both small and great, rich and poore, free and bend, to receiue a marke (or cha∣racter) in their right hands, or foreheads. This is cleerely to be seene in the popish Church. For first since their lawe of confirmation was made,Polyd. Inuen. 5. 3. the Bishop with the Chrisme doth signe the partie in the forehead with the character of the crosse. And secondly, since they made their new office or sa∣cerdotall, thus they make their catechumine.Ordo facien∣di Catechume∣num. The childe, or partie, is brought to the Church dores, where the Priest ma∣keth a crosse with his thumbe on the forehead of the childe, saying, Signum saluatoris domini nostri Iesu Christi, in fron∣tem tuam pono. And at the fonte, the Priest maketh the signe
of the crosse in the right hand of the childe, &c. saying, Trade tibi signaculum domini nostri Iesu Christi, in manu tua dextra. Yea, so carefull are they this way, that if any trauaile a∣mongst them, in his pasport they mention some marke of their face or hand, &c. as cum cicatrice in vola dextrae ma∣nus, &c. or some such like. The wordCalepini in Nomen. Name amongst the humane writers of the time in which Saint Iohn did write, doth signifie glorie, esti∣mation, a faction. Then the phrase, interpreted by the Gen∣tiles, whom this beast doth imitate, doth signifie, that none may buy or sell, but such as will receiue glorie, and estimati∣on from him, and be of his faction, or make payment of money to him, &c. Specially by his Name are ment the Bulls, and letters pa∣tents of the Popes, which from this time especially, begin with the Popes name. Vnder the priueledge of the Popes Bull, Turkes, Iewes, Mores, &c. may buy and sell, though they doe not submit themselues to their superstitions by taking the marke of the beast. The word Number, among humane writers, doth signifie diuerse orders, states and degrees, &c. Then they may not buie, &c. That will not take any order in the popish Ecclesiasticall Monarchie. Hitherto belong the orders of Knights, Soul∣diers, Friers, &c. with all these seuerall rankes of them that serue to aduance his greatnes. Particularly, it is said of his number,cap. 13.18. Let him that hath wit count the number of the beast, for it is the numberNumerus ho∣minis, for numerus hu∣manus, an hebraisme. of man (peculiarly seruing to number men by) and his number is sixe hundred sixtie sixe. By this number 666.Geneb. p. 656 Genebrard,Reg in hunc locum. and Nicolais Zegerus two Docters of the Church of Rome, doe vnderstand the Militarie number of the ancient Romane Le∣gion: vnto which, they say, Saint Iohn doth allude; to note that Antichrist here spoken of, is a Legionarie Martial and bloudie king; which doth establish his lawes, not by preaching,
but by force, and armes. This interpretation seemeth to bee most to the purpose. For the Cohortes of the Romane legion wereGeneb. p. 5. 59 called Numeri. So were theExempla Plinij. orders of Tribunes; and the Leaders of a legionGeneb. p. 656 were 666. NamelyVegetius Polybius, &c. 600. Decu∣rians: 60. Centurians, and six Tribunes. Yea, there is none of the propositions, which can bee made by the connexion of this word Number to any part of the sentence where it is men∣tioned in this prophecie, but it may bee iustified by this inter∣pretation. For example, to bee a souldier for the Pope, is a priuiledge to buy and sell, and maketh him capable of the greatest grace the Church of Rome can giue. It is the number of man. It iscap. 15.2. a number ouer which the victorie may be got. And as to be of a legion was peculiar to such as fought for Rome, so now these souldiers are for the Church of Rome. Lastly, asVegetius lib. 2. cap. 19 in a Roman legion, were schooles which required learned and wittie souldiers; for the condition of the whole legion, their seruices, and Militarie numbers, &c. or paiements were more diligently written in actes, then any other affaires; so in poperie, Let him that hath wit count the Militarie num∣ber of the beast, for the seruices done for the honour and ad∣uauncement of that policie are most carefully written vp, euen in their Legend or catalogue of saints, where none els doth come, be he neuer so good. Thus is the beast now in his pride, furnished with hornes like the Lambe, accounted the Vicar of Christ. He spaketh like the Dragon for terror, blasphemie, and doctrine of diuels: he exerciseth the power of the first beast before him, playing the part of an Emperor before his face, admirable for deceitfull signes and lying miracles, done by sorcerie, and the power of the diuell. Now doth he publish decrees, capitall lawes, and hath all priueledges of earth, Purgatorie and Heauen, to bestowe at his pleasure. How fearefull then must be his thundrings, and how bloodie his warres? The Lambe, who hitherto as opportunitie serued,cap. 6.2. &c. warred
against his enemies, by the word, the sworde, famine, pesti∣lence, &c. doth still continue the same kinde of oppositions, when it seemes good. He also continueth tocap. 9.13. &c vexe the rem∣nant for idolatrie, murther, theft, fornication, &c. as in former times. He further had vexed this Antichristian beast, taking pos∣session of the people and soyle, by ciuill Princes, in whomcap. 10.3. &c. he roared as a Lion; as also by his twocap. 11.3. &c witnesses. But now as the diuell hath aduanced the malice and greatnes of this beast; so the Lambe, Christ Iesus, doth declare himselfe more mightie in his oppositions. The ciuill Princes doe labour to keepe their authoritie and possession; doe bring to light the truth of that which the thunders haue spoken; & deliuer the booke of the word of God to such poore Preachers, as doe make a conscience of the same, and are ready to suffer for it. In the prophecie of discouering the truth of that, which the confused and tumultuous thunders haue spoken,cap. 10.4. are these things to be considered. First, a desire of those of the spirit of Saint Iohn, to record them as they were: as he saith, I was about to write them, plainely for euery man to vnder∣stand. Secondly, the impediment that hindred the cleare deliuerie, which was, that all wise men and godly, as by a voyce from heauen aduised, by reason of the perils of the times, to seale vp those things which the seuen thunders haue spoken; truely reporting them, but couered ouer with pa∣rables, &c. as Prophets doe the visions, which are not to be vnderstoode of all. Hereupon it is, that the histories of these later times doe deliuer the trueth; yet in such sort, as very fewe can picke it out by them, the face of the storie loo∣king one way, and the trueth another way. Thirdly, the Lord Iesus, in the person of this Angell presenting the ci∣uill Magistracie,cap. 10.5.6. sweareth not by Idols nor supposed saints, as the idolatrous beast doth, but by him that liueth for euer,
and created all things; that the time should neuer more be so perilous as then; but that in the dayes of the seuenth Angell, that conuerteth Kings to the gospell, the mysterie of God, in bringing Antichrist into the world, shall be finished, when it shall be as lawfull for men to preach and write the plaine trueth, as euer it was declared by the seruants of God, the Prophets. As concerning the deliuerie of the booke of Gods word to Preachers: first, it is said, that all godly men perceiuing a better course to consume Antichrist by, than to write his storie plaine, doe, ascap. 10 8. a voyce from heauen, bid those of the spirit of Saint Iohn, to leaue the huge volumes of Legends, decrees and decretals, &c. and goe and take the booke (of the Scriptures) which is open in the Angels hand, presenting the Magistracie, though it be shut to all others. Hereupon godly men, which suffered tribulation as Saint Iohn did in Patmos, doe by humble petition crauecap. 10.9. that the Angell standing, as proprietarie, vpon the sea and earth, gouer∣ning people and countries, would giue them the little booke of the word of God. This petition is graunted, but in this manner. The Prin∣ces bid the PreachersIbid. take the booke, the Bible; and so stu∣die it, that they seeme to eate it vp. Howbeit (such are the times as yet) they forewarne that the word, though sweete in their mouthes as honey, shall be bitter as gall in their belliesEzech. 2.8. & 3.1.14. Ier. 4.19. as to other Prophets. For the word is sweete to speake and heare; but when the wickednes of the times will not imbrace it, but like Lions, Panthers, Beares, &c. bloodily persecute it; the Preachers haue iustcap. 11.3. cause to mourne in their bowels. The two witnesses haue the courts giuen vnto them by the An∣gell: that is, are acknowledged to be the true visible church,In those daies the Church is visible in the persecuted. and called to preach there by the ciuill Magistrate. A holy and sufficient calling in the time of these confusions. Nei∣ther
is it required that they haue the Canonicall admission of the popish Antichristian beast. Then is the publike face of Christian religion iustly esteemed the courts of the house of God, for their presence there, in persecution, and not for the soueraigntie of the popish Gentiles. The testimonie of these witnesses, is giuencap. 14.4. &c. by innocencie of life and by preaching: of their innocencie, first it is saide, These are they that are not defiled with women, by whore∣domes, adulteries, &c. As are those which folow the popish beast; but do keep themselues to theHeb. 13.4. vndefiled mariage bed; which they teach to be honorable amongst all men, & by it are as holy as Virgines. Contrarie to Antichrist that blasphe∣meth mariage in the Clergie, as if it were heresie, &c. Secondly, they follow the lambe wheresoeuer he goethIoh. 10.3.4.5 as good sheepe that know the voice of their shephearde, and follow him, as he goeth before them. For in all things they walke according to the word of God. As namly in the sacra∣ment of the supper of Christ, the true Pascal lambe, they strickly obserue his institution. Not hearing the voice of the stranger and tyrant Antichrist, that obtrudeth doctrine of another manner of the presence of Christ there, or ad∣deth, or taketh any thing away, &c. Thirdly,cap. 10.4. these are bought (by the blood of Christ) from a∣mongst men, not partaking in the ambitions, &c. of Anti∣christ, who would possesse all the earth, excluding the true owners. Wherefore the true Martyrs and godly Christians are not to be found among them. Fourthly, they be the first fruits, holy vnto God, and to the Lambe. For these onely areDeut. 12.17.18. dedicated vnto the Lord, to sanctifie the rest of mankind: which, if these were away, were altogether vnholy and prophane in their pretended profes∣sion of God and his Christ. And so in these times, there would be no Church at all. Fiftly,cap. 14.5. in their mouthes is found no guile, speaking nothing
deceiptfully, for earthly endes; but truely, as the things of God are without hypocrisie. Contrarie to Antichrist who iscap. 13.14. deceiptfull in his words, &c. Lastly,cap. 14.5. They are without spot before the throne of God. For if they be conuented before any throne of iustice, where the righteousnesse of God doth preuaile, their most subtile ac∣cusers cānot conuict their doctrine or life of any spot. How∣soeuer Antichrist and his prelates sitting in thecap. 13.2. throne of the Dragon the diuell doe accuse and iudge them, as wicked and heretickes, &c. Concerning their preaching, first is shewed the matter they preached; and after, their seuerall doctrines which they specially handled. The Matter is the Gospell, no fruitlesse Legends. Of the bringing it abroad it is said,cap. 14.6. I saw another angell flie through the mids of heauen, to signifie that the suddaine spreading of the Gospel, in times so cruell and darke, could be attributed to none other, but some diuine hand, working by his holy angels as effectually as when he gaue the law. This Gospel is called Euerlasting, and induring for euer: not subiect to abolishment, as the Antichristian Friers did after threaten: nor alteration, by addition or diminution; which corruptions the Papacie attempteth: but as it was in the beginning, so must it continue Euerlasting. This Gospel and none other, must the witnesses preach to them that dwell vpon the earth,cap. 10.11. to euery nation, and kinred, and tongue, and people, and many kings, of these tenne which arose out of the inundations of the Barbarians. Specially they vrge these doctrines, and that vehemently, ascap. 14.7. with a loud voice; Feare God, and neither idols, nor men. Giue glorie to God, and not to such mortall men, &c. as would translate the glorie of God to themselues. Worship him that made heauen, and earth, and the sea, and fountaines of waters, & the things in them; that is, the Creator of all things, and not
Rom. 1.25.23. the creature, whether angels orEph. 2.10. men, much lesse any idol which is the worke of mans hand. The successe of this warre is very doubtfull. For first the beast doth ouercome, and after that is ouer∣come. He is said tocap. 13.7.8. ouercome them that stand against him, both Princes and witnesses. For power is giuen him ouer euerie kin∣red, and tongue, and nation. Therefore all that dwell vpon the earth shall worship him, (as a God vpon earth) whose names are not written in the booke of life, of that Lambe which was slaine from the beginning of the worlds. Of the particulars hereof will afterwards more at large be spoken. But in the meane space, we must remember, that the manner of his victorie, is to breake in peeces, deuoure, and stampe the residue vnder foote. The Complement.

In this Councel was Guibertus Archbishop of Rauenna,Mass. 16. 224. who staied in Rome after the Synode, to be made Pope by the Emperour; which when Gregorie knew (hauing beene rescued from the hands of Cincius by the furie of the people) he degraded all those which were in schisme against him.

Now were the Bishops, that were ordained by the Empe∣rour, cast out of their graues, others that liued could not ob∣taine absolution, till they digged the Emperour out of his graue, and remoued him to some place not consecrated.

But Philip was strong and fortunate in his warres, which were many, because of the Popes excommunication. AndVrsp. p. 308. the Prin∣ces and Barones, taught by the diuell, cared not to breake their oath, nor violate their faith; but confounded all iustice, taking part sometimes with Philip, sometimes with Otho. By307. the meanes of this contention, the Pope made all Ec∣clesiasticall dignities litigious, and brought them to Rome. Whereupon Vrspergensis exclaimeth. Reioyce our mother Rome, because the sluces of all treasures are opened, that whole riuers of money may runne to thee. Reioyce, for the wickednes of men; because for the recompence of so great euils, some price is paide to thee. Insult for discord thy hel∣per, which came from hell to helpe thee to money, by great
heapes. Thou hast that which thou hast thirsted for. Sing this song, that by wickednesse, and not by religion, thou hast o∣uercome the world. Men come not to thee for deuotion and conscience, but for the committing of villanies, and for de∣cision of contentions, bought out with money of thee. The begging Friers beganne the wicked order, of which Ioachim prophecied before. The first thing that the Friers did labour for, was to mag∣nifie their faction.Ex Mat. Pa∣ris. p. 910.

Nowe be∣cause the Gospel which the scripture callethcap. 14.6. Eternall, was commonly preached to the hazzard of the papacie; these called their booke, The eternall Gospell, and the Gospell of the holy Ghost. This they said, excelled that written by the foure Euangelists, so much as the kernell passeth the shell, and as light excelleth darkenes. And therefore taught,N.B. that within threescore yeares, vz. 1260. the Gospel written by the foure Euangelists should cense, and bee abolished, and theirs should steppe vp instead thereof, and continue for e∣uer.Sibrandus Lb. d. Christ. og. 2. cap. 7. This booke the Friers commended to the Pope to bee canonized, who esteemed it much. For from hence the Popes doe continue many wicked prankes, to weaken, if not to a∣bolish the authority of the Scriptures.

At the same time, one Fulco preached in France, and moued many to take the crosse, and fight in the holy land. Whereupon two Earles came with their armies to the Pope, who sent one of them against his owne enemies in Campania; the other went as towards Ierusalem; in the way the Venetians spoyle a certaine citie called Satira. After the armie went to Constantinople, beat a part of the citie, entred and tooke many spoyles, and reliques of Saints. He that readeth, iudge if it were not theft; and if the Pope can excuse that rapine by the Isralites robbing the Egyptians.Trith. p. 219. After the capitu∣lations were made for the quiet of the Empire, Philip went to pursue some rebels in Saxony; and as he rested in his chamber, hauing opened a veyne, he was murthered by Otho Palatinus, because he did not worship the beast. And so was ended this fourth Thunder. The fifth Thunder. Anno 1208.VPonTrith. p. 219. 220. the death of Philip the Emperor, was Otho cho∣sen with one consent of all the Princes. The Pope hea∣ring thereof, and that he had maried his neere kinswoman, liked it, and by Legates confirmed it. Wherefore Otho go∣ing into Italy, is honorably receiued by the Princes and Pope; and is crowned. At this time the Franciscan Friers began. There were also great heates, fearefull thundrings, and lightnings. AndCrant. 7. 35. now while the Pope did chalenge Apulia, &c. to belong to the Church of Rome, and the Em∣peror thought not; there arise dissentions betweene them,Vrsp. p. 313. so that the Pope pronounceth him contumacious, excom∣municated

Whereupon the Princes elect Fridericus the sonne of Hen∣ricus the sixt Emperor, as an euill diuell in Israel: which election the Pope confirmeth, and Fridericke is garded through Italy by the Princes of Italy.

WhereforeVrsp. p. 314. the Pope sent fiue times to him in short space for peace; but the Emperor despising the Popes com∣maundements, could not be stirred, but that he would roote out Fridericus; and be reuenged of the French King, for the wrongs he had done to England. Hereupon the Pope tooke courage,Pag. 317. and resolued vpon two things; to recouer the holy land from the Saracens; and to reforme the Church against heretikes, and such as impugned the liberties there∣of. And so requiredTrith. p. 221. the Archbishop of Mogunce to de∣clare the Emperor excommunicate and deposed. The Prin∣ces that fauored Otho, spoyled the cities, religious houses and Churches of the diocesse of Mogunce; and Otho retur∣ning into Germany subdued many rebels.Geneb. pag. 957. 958. The Albingenses in the parts of Tholosa in France, maintained many doctrines against the Church of Rome, as against prayers to the virgine Mary, &c.

But now the Pope preacheth the crosse (and absolution from all sinnes) in Austria, Saxony, Westphalia, Phrisia, and all Germany, to assist his Captaine against them.

The Pope also sent hisAbb. Vrsp. p. 314. 315. letters to the Clergie and Princes, for ayde against the Saracens in the holy land. His chiefe argument to perswade by, was this. The Saracens from the time of Grego∣rius the first, when they began, haue continued 666. yeeres almost; which time according to thecap. 13. vlt. Reuelatiō they should certainly be rooted out. So foolishly did this false Prophet vnderstand that place.Vrsp. p. 319. Betweene Otho and Fridericus were warres; and Otho because his friends forsooke him, was constrained to giue ground awhile. Fridericus pursued him, and vexed his fauorites; yet did Otho gather vp himselfe to fight, both with Fridericus and the French King. But by the French King he was put to the worse.Anno 1214. Trith.

So that yet it was not concluded, that the seruice of God should be in a strange tongue, as the papists would per∣swade. This Councell ended, the Pope preacheth the crosse,Mat. Paris. p. 263. Vrs. 315. and pardon of all sinnes, for aide of the holy land; and5. D.T. 7. de haeresib. against heretikes, promising to those catholikes that take the crosse to roote out heretikes, as large priuiledges as were graunted to them that fight against the infidels; and now doe the Popes teach asCurio. 1. p. 28. Mahomet did, that who died for his religion should goe to paradise. Hereupon many tooke the crosse to goe against the Saracens. And many orders of souldiers arose, the crosse-bearing souldiers were aduanced. InVolat. 21. f. 244. Arragon were two orders of souldiers; the first, Saint Mary, for the redemption of captiues, whose colours were white, a crosse blacke. The other Monlesiae, with a red crosse; these were to defend the countrie from the irruptions of the Saracens. There were also the Domi∣nicans, or preaching Friers aduanced. InTrith. p. 224. those dayes were many (called) heretikes, men and women, which spread their opinions in Almania, France, and Italy. In the citie of Argentine were more then fourescore apprehended, whom Conrade the inquisitor thus examined. He caused an iron to to be made red hot, and whom the hot iron did hurt hee condemned for heretikes, and deliuered them to be burned, (for the beast hath teeth of yron and nailes of brasse,) many be∣leeued he condemned many innocents. InGeneb. p. 958. Alsatia many held against the Pope; and the Grecians against transubstan∣tiation. So did Almericus a very learned man; his bones, and the bones of diuers that followed him, were digged vp againe and burned at Paris, (for the beast suffereth not their
carcasses to be put in graues.)Fasc. Temp. l. 80. As the Pope preached the crosse, so did the diuell; 20, 000, boyes, &c. in Almania tooke the signe of the crosse, to goe to Ierusalem against the Turkes; but at the shore they were either drowned or sold to the Saracens. A huge company of heardesmen came from Spaine, and likewise (tooke the crosse and) spoyled the Clergie about Paris. Honorius the thirdVrsp p. 320. made such preachers as grew cold in perswading, and such people as were slacke in obeying,Anno 1216. to be more zealous to recouer the holy land; prophecying (but falsely) that in his time, Ierusalem should be recouered from the Saracens. HeGeneb. p. 961. Trith. p. 225. confirmed the order of the Domi∣nicans, and Franciscans, whomVrsp p. 318. 319. Innocentius the third ap∣proued; because their vow was in all things to be obedient to the Apostolike seate; and to stand for the defence of the mother Church. They sayPet. de Nat. Clictouens hom. de Francisco. the Pope was vnwilling to confirme their order, till in a (lying) vision by night he saw Dominicke, or as other say Francis, with his onely shoulders bearing vp the Laterane Church, that by mine was readie to fall. They also fable, that when Christ came armed with three darts to destroy the world; at the instance of his Mo∣ther, he was content to respite the world, till she had made experience of her two champions; sufficient to conuert the whole world. viz. Dominicke and Francis; and iudicially pronounced, that if the world were not conuerted by them, he would presently make an end of it. Howbeit asProg. finis mundi parte. 1. 2. Vin∣centius writeth Anno 1416. more then a hundred yeeres af∣ter the prefixed time, that the world was worse; these reli∣gious persons were abhominable, rather snares and wolues then pastors.

But whereas certaine Earles had taken some of his castles in Apulia, he fighteth with them, and doth ouercome them, who flie to the Pope that protecteth them; whereof the Emperor complaineth. The crosse is preached in Almany; whereupon the people commit many murthers and horrible facts, vpon assurance of pardon, for taking the crosse.Pag. 323. The Emperor subdueth the Saracens, and also certaine rebels in Apulia. The Christi∣ans who had taken the crosse and were come to Nilus, by the great and continual confluence of new aydes, tooke the impregnable citie of Damiata; where they make a most miserable spectacle by the slaughter of the Paganes. By the meanes of the Popes Legate (VVestmonast p. 278. who came rather to the de∣solation of the armie, then for the consolation thereof) and by meanes of Ludouicus Banarus, they proudly refused a most honorable and profitable composition, which the Soldan offered; namely to haue restored Ierusalem, and the countries about it, for the citie Damiata. But after by the stratagems of the Soldan, they were driuen to accept of their owne liues.Trith. p. 228. 230.

This Pope did strictly forbid the reading of the ciuill law in Paris and the places adioyning. He warred with the Emperor in Apulia; Iohn the Emperor of Constantinople obtained of him to absolue the Emperor Fridericus the second, that he might make an expedition a∣gainst the Turkes, who daily preuailed in Asia. Gregorius the ninthVrsp. p. 324. as a proud man, in his first yeere,Anno 1227. contrary to iustice, began to excommunicate the Emperor Fridericus, vpon friuolous and false occasions; obiecting that hee went not into the holy land, as he promised:Trith. p. 231. which excommunication also the Pope sendeth abroad to Arch∣bishops &c.Mat. Paris. 332. 333. by his bulles; in which he complaineth that the Church was indangered by the Pagans, (the Angels a∣bout Euphrates) the Emperour (the Angell that setteth his right foote on the sea and left vpon the earth) heretikes, (the two witnesses of Christ) and by false brethren (godly men hid from the presence of the Serpent.)Vrsp. p. 324. The Emperour pub∣lisheth his Apologie, andMat. Paris. p. 335. writeth to Princes, complaineth of the false imputations laid against him by the Pope; shew∣ing that the Church of Rome is so enflamed with the bur∣ning
affection of couetousnesse, that the goods of the Church are not sufficient to satisfie her thirst: and that shee blusheth not to disinherit Emperours, Kings, and Princes, and make them tributaries. &c.Vrsp. p. 325. Besides, the Emperour ma∣keth sure vnto him, diuerse of the noblest Romans, who while the Pope pursueth his excommunications, by the as∣sistance of the people, expell the Pope out of Rome with shame; and doe vexe his territories with warre. The Pope stirreth vp the King of Ierusalem, Mathew and Thomas, Earles of Tuscia, against the Emperor. The Emperor resol∣ueth to goe his voyage for the holy land, and the Pope was a meanes to hinder the assemblie of the Princes, with whom the Emperor should take order for the affaires of the Em∣pire in his absence. When the Emperor was gone, the Pope notwithstanding causedTrith. p. 231. him to be proclaimed excom∣municate, throughout all Germany, which was done espe∣cially by the begging Friers.Vrsp. Ibid. Besides, his souldiers that tooke the crosse were spoyled by the Popes meanes. InFox. Marty.

Wherefore the Emperor endured much danger by the treason of the Templars abroade; and the Pope at home inhibited all ayde that would haue gone ouer to him, but warred vpon, and subdued many of his possessions. Who is it that well considereth these things, and doth not bewaile, and detest them? which seeme an euidence and prodigious portent of the ruine of the Church.Westmo. p. 288. The Pope taking it ill that Fridericus, as despi∣sing his excommunications, did embrace the businesses of the Church, in the holy land; despayring that he would not returne to vnitie, decreed to depriue him of his Empire, and substitute another; namely the General of his warres, whom he ayded with all that the Church of Rome could doe; with
treasure, armies, pardons, and solicitations of all Prelates abundantly. Which when the Emperor vnderstoode, heVrsp. p. 325. Mat.

But when the returne of the Emperor was once knowen, the furie slacked; both Christians and Saracens cleaue vnto him, and byTrith. p. 23. the valour of his Germane souldiers recouereth many of his cities a∣gaine.

The Emperor would pacifie seditions which were risen in his strong cities of Italy; which he did with violence, and burned his rebels. At which time, in Germany, many no∣bles and meane persons; Clerkes, Monkes, and Nunnes, Citizens and countrie people, by the giddie sentence of Conrade, the Popes inquisitor, were burned in the name of heretikes.

Of which army as many as the Emperor tooke, he crossed them with crosse woundes vpon the heads, faces, or bodies.

He presently con∣firmed the excommunication of Fridericus, who therefore stopped the waies of the Popes postes, and hanged vp two Minorites, that by stealth did carry letters to mooue sediti∣on
amongst the Nobles. The Templars for hatred of the Em∣perour besieged and vexed the Teutonici in the holy land, not suffering them to burie their dead.588. Many Princes are alienated from the Emperour, and elect the Landgraue of Thuring against him.589. But the Emperour presently made peace with the Landgraue. VVise men laboured to make peace betweene the Pope and the Emperour; but the Em∣perour refused to submit himselfe absolutely to the Popes censure, desiring to haue the causes and conditions first known; neither would hee resigne the rites of the Empire.592. The lamentable newes of the Tartars had stirred all Chri∣stendome against them, had not the grieuous distraction be∣tweene the Pope and Emperour beene the let. The friers, Preachers, and Minorites, fall out bitterly betweene them∣selues.594. The Pope sendeth an Extortor into England, (&c.) with power to suspend, excommunicate, and punish many waies, all such as would not suffer him to leauie what money he pleased. (For the beast is footed like a Beare.)Mat. Paris. p. 617. 618. VVhen the Emperour laboured for peace with the Pope in vaine, the Pope (as it seemed of purpose to bring the Emperour into causelesse hatred) fled into Ianua; where he had Gallies ready to entertaine him. The Emperour (smelling the Popes drift) said with griefe, The wicked flie when none followeth. The Popes faction perswadeth the Landgraue to take the dignity of the Empire in hand, & make warre vpon Fridericus whom they called tyrant, persecutor, a confederate with Saracens, For the beast doth open his mouth to blaspheme them that are called Gods, &c. But the Landgraues friends aduiseth him not to trust the promises of the Popes partie; and the Emperour comming on a suddaine, the Landgraue was alienated from that purpose, and gaue gifts to the Emperour, and so they parted friends.622. The Pope sendeth (abroad as) to England, by strange and incredible authoritie to rake money for aide against the Emperour623. 624. who writeth to England, to staie
their contribution; and rather to exempt themselues from former impositions; protesting his innocencie; and that the Pope had reiected his submission; the manner whereof, hee was willing to referre to the censure of the Kings, of Eng∣land and France, and their Barones. (See a Lambe in the throne.)632. The French king, vpon recouerie of a desperate sickenesse, voweth a voyage into the holy land.633. After the presages of heauie things, as thunders, and lightenings,635. the Pope through France causeth the Emperour to be preach∣ed excommunicate: which when a Priest should denounce, he said to the people; I know the Pope and Emperour to be at controuersie, the cause I know not; but I pronounce the partie excommunicated that doth the wrong, and absolue the innocent.636. The Pope calleth a Councel at Lugdunum, where his chamber was burned,638. as it was thought of pur∣pose; to get occasion to extort money of the Prelates, com∣ming to the Councell.642. And partly by moning his wants, and partly by large promises of preferments, many of the prelates bestowed incredible wealth vpō the Pope,VVestmonst. whom againe he honoured with titles and dignities.Mat. Paris. p. 643. 644. 645. In the Coun∣cell, the Emperours proctor answered diligently for his Lord, & made large offers to subiect the Romane Empire to the Church of Rome; to fight against the Tartars, and for the holy land. All which the Pope insolently reiected, and refu∣sed the kings of France and England to bee sureties for the Emperours promise herein.658. And6.

The Pope to further his purposes,Volat. 22. f. 255. Geneb. 970.971. aduanced the Cardinals. For whereas before they had not that brauerie of retinue and ornaments, he granted them, for honour to ride
on white horses, and to weare red hats, in token they should spend their liues for the Church of Rome: likeCurio. 1. p. 28. the Princes that followed Mahomet, who drewe their swords and pro∣mised by solemne oath, to allow of none other law but that which Mahomet should make: in defence and setting forth whereof, they then and there protested at all times, when neede should require, to spend their blood and liues.Mat. Paris. 655. The Pope with large promises, and bribes, and supplications, re∣questeth the Electors to choose another. But Fridericus preuented him with disswasions,Pag. 658. and putteth a crowne on his own head, reuiling the Pope, and threatning bloodie warres before he would loose it.Gob. ae. 6. c. 64 There passed sharp letters betweene the Pope and the Emperour:235. the Emperour ad∣uising the Pope to absolue him, lest (saith he) our lyon which faineth himselfe to sleepe, doe wake, and with his terrible roaring doe driue all fatte bulls out of all lands, and plan∣ting righteousnesse, doe gouerne the Church, rooting out the hornes of the proud.Mat. Paris. p. 659. 660. And of that argument sent letters abroad, which was the meanes hee had lesse regard.662. The French king commandeth the Pope to conference about the Emperours peace, and his owne voyage to the holy land:664. and the kings brother and diuers Nobles take the crosse.675. 676. The French king againe importuneth the Pope for the Emperours peace, but still in vaine. Wherefore he depar∣teth from the Pope angrie, because he found not that humi∣litie, which he hoped for, in the seruant of the seruants of God.680. The Clergie of England murmureth and complaineth that they were constrained to finde and paie souldiers to serue at the Popes pleasure, which opportunitie the Empe∣rour tooke, to draw them to concurrence with him; and682. by his letters aliened many Princes hearts from the Pope, be∣cause they feared the pride of the court of Rome, if the Em∣perour were brought vnder.The sonne of perdition. Wherfore the Pope endeauou∣reth by setting vp the Landgraue to tread in peeces the Em∣perour
irrecouerably. (For now the beast doth destroy, breake in peeces, and stampe the residue vnder foote.) But the Emperour intercepted the money he sent to the Landgraue. Conradus the sonne of Fridericus comming with an armie against the Landgraue, by the Popes meanes, his souldiers ranne to his enemie, and so he was constrained to flie.Paral. Vrsp. For much distra∣ction of mindes, and many troubles were in Germanie by this occasion. AndMat. Paris. p. 684. now there was a new fashion in the court of Rome. For when any great persons were at warres, they would by absolution or excommunication, strengthen or weaken them, as might best serue for the profit of the court. The Pope raketh money, and gathereth aide against the Emperour. And contrarily, the Emperour sendeth victu∣als to the holy land. (See the difference between the monstrous beast and the Lambe.)Mat. Paris. p. 688. The French king leuieth money for his voyage, the Pope for the Landgraue, against the Empe∣rour. The Emperour by his humilitie getteth much fauour; and the Pope for his insolent reiections of his submission, exasperateth many. There690. 691. followed such lightenings and thūders, as haue not bin seene the like; after which the Pope sent certaine traitors to murther Fridericus; but missing their purpose, they were stricken with feare, as with lightening from heauen.695. After which (it is thought the Pope to crie quittance with the Emperour, falsely reported that) two ruf∣fians sent by Fridericke, should haue killed the Pope. Now697. grew the Pope detested for rapine, who raked money in∣satiably to maintaine the Landgraue against Fridericus.703. 704. But when the Landgraue was ready to be crowned, Conradus the Emperours sonne came vpon them with a mightie ar∣mie; and by wisdom and valour after much Christian blood∣shed, ouerthrewe the Landgraues forces, who for sorrow di∣ed ignominiously. TheTrith. p. 241. Landgraue liued fiue yeares with the title of a king, but did nothing worth the marking. For as long as Fridericus liued, neither the Pope, nor any prince,
preuailed against him. He contemned the Popes deposition as friuolous; and found so strong a faction of the Gibellines, that he plagued Italie in such sort, that he made the Pope wearie of his life, and wish he had neuer deposed him.Mat. Paris. p. 704. Vp∣on this successe, the Pope sendeth foure Cardinals into the foure quarters of the world, and pettie Legates to speciall places, to defame Fridericke and his sonne, and to preach pardons to all that would inuade, persecute, and teare them in peeces, if they could; and to that purpose, by couetous craft, and craftie couetousnesse, to rake what money could be got. But (while the beast thus rageth) Fridericke inforceth the Apulians, &c. to sweare homage to his sonne; and cau∣seth Hensius his sonne, to plague the Popes kinsmen, and hang them vp whom the Pope loued best. InParal. Vrsp. p. 330. Sueuia many preachers are countenanced by Conradus the sonne of Fri∣dericus, who preached against the vices, authoritie, and par∣dons of the Popes, and preached pardon by Christ:Mat.

TheMat. Paris. p. 768. Pope thinking to deale more warily, sent treasure to William by secret messengers; but both his money and pro∣uision were intercepted. The PopesMat. Paris. p. 711. 171.

The Emperour comming to besiege the Pope at Lugdunum was hindered by those of Parma, &c. and soTrith. p. 244 is William crowned with great solemnitie. But
Mat. Paris. p. 712. because all the Princes agreed not to the election, there sprung vp new contentions. Fridericke is enraged against his Italian rebels, and straiteth them by siege.721. 722. But while Fride∣ricke was absent, the Parmenses sally out, take the Emperors treasure, and kil or disperse his forces: which made the Pope incredibly ioyfull. But Fridericke reunited his forces; and there was neuer anger betweene any so great, as was be∣tweene the Pope and the Emperour. The Emperour vexed the Pope the more, and afflicted the Parmenses as before.724. The French king taking his voyage, importuneth the Pope for the peace of Fridericke, but in vaine; though hee shewed the Pope, that els the impediment of the businesses of the holy land, would be imputed to the Pope. So the king ta∣keth shippe, leauing behinde him many choise souldiers, which725. presently began to mutine; but the Pope so char∣med them, that he got from them their money, and armes, and victuals, and sent them pennilesse away.736. By the Cardi∣nals inuectiues the reputation of Frediricke did stinke, and he was accounted worse than Herod, Iudas, or Nero: and they had preuailed against him, had it not beene738. for the coue∣tousnesse, vsuries, simonies, and other filthie vices of the Court of Rome.739. By the Popes meanes, it is said, the Empe∣rours Physitian should haue poysoned him, but it was dis∣couered: and741. his aides to the Emperours rebels were in∣tercepted.742. Fridericke now toyled with sicknesse, and losse of his sonnes, offereth an honest forme of peace. The Pope re∣ioycing in his calamities (beeing such a one as will neuer be ap∣peased) would not accept it:Rom. 1. wherefore the Pope was hated by many, and they comforted Fridericke, and claue to him, detesting the pride of the seruant of the seruants of God. Hereby748. Fridericus so preuailed, that in abhomination of the Court of Rome, many thrust out William, and the Popes Legate; and bound themselues by oath to bee faithfull to Fridericus. The rebels of Italie were so vexed, that the Mar∣chants
longing for peace, detested the Pope for his rebelli∣on; and because hee would not accept the Emperours hu∣miliation, but desired to tread him vnder foote, whom hee called the great Dragon; that when hee had him vnder, hee might with more ease stampe also vpon the Kings of Eng∣land and France, and other princes, whom he called Basilisks, or little kings, and little serpents, and might at his pleasure spoile their prelates of their treasure.p. 760. The French king ta∣keth Damiata. For762. which the Soldan offereth the kingdom of Ierusalem, much treasure and peace; so that there was hope that he purposed to become a Christian. But (as the pope formerly commanded) all was refused by the popes Legate. It seemeth that he that writethAnnot. in Sonn. 107. annotations vpon Petrarchs Sonets, speaketh of this storie, when he saith that the king of Spaines brother, (I thinke he should say the king of France his brother) proclaimed the pope Soldan of Baby∣lon, which he calleth Baladac. When they had refused the Soldans offer, they could not afterwards intreate, but found bloodie warre. ButMat. Paris. 762. 763. Fridericke subdued happily many of his rebels. The popes souldiers robbed them that were sig∣ned with the crosse for the holy land; taking their money from them. And the armie in the holy land was deuided. In767. 768. fight the French king is taken, who though at first he refu∣sed, yet at last is constrained to surrender Damiata vpon hard conditions; and772. 773. sendeth by his two brethren to the pope to relieue his shame and difficulties by the absolution of Fridericke. His brethren said to the pope, that it were best to absolue him, els all would thinke the pope of an obstinate hatred, they would remooue him from Lyons, and raise all France against him. Because they vrged the Pope to make peace with Fridericke as he loued the honour of the vniuer∣sall Church, and would auoid to be charged to be the cause of the losse of the holy land, by his couetousnesse, and mar∣chandise of such souldiers that tooke the crosse for the aide
of such souldiers that tooke the crosse for the aide of the holy land; the777. pope craueth to be at Burdeux and grow∣eth inexorable. Then also died Fridericus, the wonder of the world, and so ended the sixth Thunder. The seuenth Thunder. COnradusCaron. the sonne of Fridericus the second;Anno 1250. (Trith. p. 239. who had before been chosen King of Romanes) did reigne.Mat. Paris. 780. In signe of the wrath of God, there were exceeding hor∣rible thunders; a heauie prognostication.781. Conrade ma∣keth sure his prisoners, that rebelled against his father; and with his brethren, and friends doth rise against the Pope; who for the insatiable couetousnes of his whole race, was hatefull to the Imperials,783. and feared such ginnes and snares of the Romanes, to recouer an inestimable summe of money from him, which he caused them to lay out in his warres against Fridericke, that he durst not returne to his seate in Rome.791. Yea the hearts of many departed from the father the Pope, who raged as a fierce stepfather; and from the mother the Church of Rome, who was cruell in perse∣cution, as a stepmother. The792. pope departing from Lug∣dunum, calleth the people together to bid them farwell. By his Orator after other speeches, concludeth; that the city had receiued this benefit, and almes by the Popes presence, that where at his comming, there were onely found three, or foure whorehouses in the city, he left but one; and that reached from the East gate to the west. Thus is the Popes courte the mother of fornications, and abhominations of the earth.Mat. Prris. p. 795. many heardsmen, foolishly take the crosse to fight against the Turkes in the holy land. The Pope setteth forth new decretals, and (minding peace)798. 799. absolueth some no∣bles from their excommunication. Whom he marrieth to his neeces; by which holy marriage, they which were the children of wrath, become (forsooth) the sonnes of grace
and chosen vessels. But hee excommunicateth Conrade. Whereupon, the enemies of the Church are multiplied.Pag. 800. Conrade hauing got the fauour of many of the Princes of the Empire, the Pope preacheth the crosse against him, with farre larger pardons, then were graunted to them that fought against the Turkes in the holy land. For the fathers and mothers of such were to be pardoned that sought a∣gainst Conrade. When the Queene and Nobles of France, saw the Pope to minde onely his ambition; and to neg∣lect their distressed King, in the holy laud; they tooke into their hands, the goods and lands of those that were signed against Conrade; bidding them liue of the Pope, that fought for him. The like was don in other places. Hence the Pope through shame began to treate of peace with Conra∣dus.Pag 801. There were more fearefull thunders. The Pope (to make peace) desireth to marry a neece of his,Pag. 805. to the brother of Conradus; and strengtheneth himselfe by making of new Cardinals. But the Princes of the Empire conceiued much indignation against the presumption of the Pope, for seeking to ignoble Princes, by the marriage of his neeces. William Earle of Holland, being sorrowfull for his presump∣tion in accepting the Empire, resigned,Pag. 781. and hauing lost his owne Earledome and all, detested the mousetrappes, and promises of the Pope; being constrained to begge.808. Conrade hauing gained the fauour of all the Italians, in a manner, had poyson giuen him; as was thought by the Popes faction; but hee recouered stangely, and grew in∣to more fauour. Yet would not the Pope be perswaded to crowe him, least he should proue like his father,813. but see∣ing the daunger of Christendome, by the contention, the Pope sought to make peace with his foes, by giuing them his neeces in marriage. Howbeit the poyson which Conrade escaped, and imputed to the Pope, and the contradiction of the Princes of the Empire, to such presumptuous marriages,
gained Conrade much fauour, hindred this kinde of peace; and lost the Pope many friends and much credit. Where∣upon Conradus persecuted the Pope with fire and sworde; and spoyled such as went to the court of Rome.814. And so our father the Pope, who rather followed the steps of Con∣stantine then Peter, stirred vp many calamities in the world. TheMat. Paris. p. 829. Pope considering that Richard the King of Englands brother, was very rich, baited a hooke sweetely to catch his seruice, and wealth. For trusting vpon his sophistry and deceit, that said, AllMat. 4.9. these things will I giue thee if thou wilt fall downe and worship me, caused him to be elected and cal∣led King of Apulia, Sicilia, and Calabria.Mat. Paris p. 832. At this time, (such was the couetousnes and rapine of the Pope in England) that vpon a computation, which the Bishop of Lincolne caused to be made, it appeared that this Pope, impouerished the vniuersall Church more then all his predecessors, and that in England, his gaine was more then the Kings reuenue.838. The Romanes threaten them of Perusium with sieg, and desolation, if they held the Pope any longer. Wherefore the Pope with feare and trembling, goeth to Rome; fea∣ring least the mony should be exacted of him, which was dispended in the warres against Fridericke. But he paliated his sorrow as well as he could, and went to Rome. (For the beast hath a face like a Lyon, that taketh scorne to looke vpon the nettes he is intangled with.)843. The Pope wrote to Grost∣head Bishop of Lincolne, to make a boy a Prehend at Lin∣colne, which the Bishop refused to doe; shewing that the sinne of the diuell and Antichrist, was to kill the soules of men by defrauding them of ministers able to teach. With844. which answere, the Pope was enraged; and sware by Saint Peter and Saint Paul, were it not for the gentlenes of his owne nature, his slaue, the King of England, should make the Bishop a fable, &c. The Cardinals labored much to pacifie the Popes fury; partly by preferring the goodnes of the
Bishop, before the Pope and his Cardinals; partly by ad∣uising the Pope to winke at all; least there should arise some tumult; especially because it is knowen, that there must come a departing from the Church of Rome.846. 847. 848. This Grosthead on his death-bead, reproued the preaching Friers, and Mi∣norites as heretikes; for their negligence, and the Pope of heresie, for offering to place a boy ouer the soules of men; and proueth that the Pope is Antichrist. Of the court of Rome he deliuered this censure. Eius auaritiae, totus non sufficit orbis, Aegypte. Sodom. Eius luxuriae, meretrix non sufficit omnis. Aegypte. Sodom. He also prophecied, that the Church should not be de∣liuered from the Aegyptian seruitude, in which it was, but by a bloudy sword. (Here is the policy of Rome,cap. 11.8. called Egypt.) Conrade prospereth in Italy in despite of the Pope.Mat. Paris. p. 850. 855. At this time, ignorant persons, and boyes were aduanced to Church dignities (fit builders for Babel.) The Pope in a most furious rage, purposing to auenge himselfe of Grosthead, as of an in∣fidel and rebel, &c. inIbid. Et Poly. Chr. lib. 7. cap. 36. the night Grost bead, in his Bishops ornaments appeared vnto him; and with a sterne counte∣nance and angry speech said; arise wretch and come to thy doome, &c. and smote him on the left side, right to the heart with his crosse staffe; so that the Pope awaked with feare and paine, horribly frighted. Neither did the ven∣gance of the indignation of God so rest towards him; for in his warres against Conrade he lost 4000. of his army; nei∣ther had the Pope euer any good night or day afterwards. TheMat. Paris. p. 861. dissention grew great betweene the pope and Con∣rade; and the pope sorged falsely many blasphemous ac∣cusations against him; as of heresie, murther, &c. thereby to stirre vp the King of England against him.863. 864. There was in England a miraculous thunder-clap. When the pope saw that Richard the King of Englands brother, would not be taken in his nettes; but held his gift of Apulia, &c. as if he
had giuen him the mone for the fetching; he solicited the King of Emgland to accept it; promising to turne the soul∣dier that were signed with the crosse for the aide of the ho∣ly land, to assist him. This made all the princes and prelates of the holy land deteste the Romane falsehoodes.Fox Marty. pag. 3. Ar∣noldus de noua villa, taught that Sathan by popery had de∣ceiued the world. Gulielmus de sancto amore, applieth all the textes of Scripture, that spake against Antichrist, to the pope and his Clergie.Mat. Paris. p. 864. 865. The King of England with ioy accepted the popes offer of the kingdome of Sicilia, &c. and fed the pope with mony. But vpon the resistance of Conradus, the popes army failed. Conrade also died,Gobel. 6.65. as is reported of poyson.Mat. Paris. p. 865. The pope exceedingly reioyced, and laughed for the death of his two great enemies; Grosthead, and Conra∣dus.868. Shortly after the pope himselfe dying, comforted his weeping friends thus: do not I leaue you rich enough, what would you more? when he was dead he was seene by a Car∣dinall, condemned to hell for the hurt he did to the Church. Thuscap. 10.3. &c. when the Angel Christ; the King by princes had reared for their possessions, seuen thunders of the popes ex∣ecrations, vtter their voyces, which the writers of the time doe seale vp by a darke kinde of deliuerie.Carian. f. 203. Par. Vrs. p. 332 After which time the Empire stoode without any certaine Caesar, for sea∣uenteene yeeres; for feare of the danger that might befall by the popes meanes. And the affaires of Asia came into great danger by the popes proceedings. Thus also he mak∣eth warre against the Saints, and doth ouercome them. So here is fulfilled that which is written:cap. 13. 7. 8. And power was giuen him ouer euery kindred, and tongue, and nation. Those thunders lasted 150. yeeres. For from the time of Hildebrand, which was 1074. to Alexander the fourth, which was 1254. is 180. yeeres. From whence if we take the time of peace from Honorius the second, to Adrian the fourth, which was 30. yeeres, the remainder will be 150. yeere.

In his time the preaching Friers had much dammaged the Christian saith by preach∣ing,Reade more hereof before Anno 1200. reading, & teaching certaine doctrines, & new dotings taken out of the book of Abbas Ioachim, condēned by Gre∣gorius the ninth. They also had composed a booke, which it pleased them to intitle, The euerlasting or eternall Gospel,
which now they inforced to roote out the Gospell of Christ written by the foure Euangelists. They also vrged many o∣ther things not to be spoken. Hereupon grew so many and great scandales, one preaching against the other; that the vniuersitie of Paris, with great counsaile and deliberation, sent sixe men very excellent for learning, and of noble blood, to the Pope in commission, for the repaire of the decay in faith. The Friers sent speedy messengers to resist these great men to their faces before the Pope At length after much a doe their new Gospell is commaunded to be burned secretly, without any scandall to the Friers. And so was that Gospel abolished, that by a false Prophecy threat∣ned the cessation of the Gospell written by the foure Euan∣gelists. TheGeneb. p. 978. Mass. 17. pag. 238. Fo. Marty. 326.

confirme vnto my Prince, his power, &c. doe subiect vnto him cities, nations, of countries, Eagles defend my glorie, (behold the Gentiles.) Departing from Rome he had more rebels that op∣posed themselues against him, ouer most of whom he tri∣umphed.

For that which was execrable in the Saracens,Mat.

His death was the safetie of Rupertus, and the Florentines. (For this murther, at the place and time of the worship of God according to his word) there was euery where a famine, after which followed a very great pestilence. The Pope in a Councell openly declareth the oath of the Emperour (now murthered) to bee an oath of fidelitie and obedience, and requireth it alwaies so to be vn∣derstood.Clem. 2 tit. 9. in gloss. verb. futur.

(Thus Michael fighteth for the word of God.) Many wicked things are obiected to these of Dulcinus, the Begnardes, and Lolliards opinion. But because in the time of the heathen Emperours, the diuell did accuse the brethren: and in this time of Antichrist, the beast doth blaspheme them that dwell in heauen, their accusation may iustly be suspected to be slanderous. Especially seeing they confesse that the Bo∣emians in the time of Hus were of their sect; who are very well known to maintaine none of these impieties.Paral. Vrsp. 351.

There was also the plague of bloudy flixes, and such inflammations, as consumed the flesh to the bones, not onely of liuing bodies but dead carcasses, for the earth is smitten with plagues in the dayes of their prophe∣cie.Curio.

That they were the ouerthrow of all learning and artes, the decay of stu∣dents; and by ingrossing into their libraries, bred such a want of bookes, that there was not a Bible, nor any good diuinity bookes to be had for mony. It seemeth in these times that the question was,Specul Mino. Tract. 3. f. 135. b. whether the Popes dispensa∣tions could stablish the conscience against Scripture and law. The Popes would haue it receiued for good, that his power was aboue all; but godly men thought otherwise of

CHAP. X. Of the first resurrection and the warres which followed here∣upon, with their successe. MIserable are now the times, by reason of the grosse ignorance and superstition, which preuailed. For by the tyrannie of the Popes, all men were sedu∣ced, or terrified from the study and profession of true god∣linesse. And the wickednes of the Friers by purloyning, in a manner all good bookes (which now were but manu∣scripts) and teaching nothing but fables; had made it ge∣nerally suspected, that Antichrist would take this oppor∣tunitie to obliterate the Scriptures &c; and obtrude vnto the world any such forged diuinitie, which might best serue to further his ambition. In the time of this palpable darkenes, worse then euer was any in Egypt, when as the truth lay as dead, and buried for euer; the Lord in mercy doth raise it from death to life.
And this doth cause,Dan. 12.2. such as turne others vnto righteousnes, to shine as the starres in the firmament. The summe of that which followeth, is, thatcap. 11.7. when they (the witnesses) haue finished their testimony, the beast that com∣meth out of the bottomlesse pit, with his hornes, the Kings maketh warre against them. Of this warre we are to consider the enemies; their man∣ner of fight, and the successe. The enemies are the two witnesses,cap. 19.13. vnder their captaine; yet in the wildernes, in this chapter; and in the blessed time, separated from Antichrist, in the next chapter; and19. the beast with his Kings. The captaine of these witnesses, is mighty to enable them to finish their testimony. That the witnesses may the better finish and perfect their testimony, Saint Iohn doth say. And11. I saw heauen open, that is, an expectation of all good men which belong to the kingdome of heauen, what will be the end of those cruell lawes, and bloudy executions. That which befell was this, Ancap. 18.1. Angel came downe from heauen, hauing great power, so that the earth was lightened with his glory, that is, the glorious Gospel, which now was excluded by all men, came by the mighty hand of God to be pub∣lished and preached; to the dispelling of the darkenes, which Antichrist brought into the earth; as if it had been brought from heauen, by the ministery of a mighty Angel, to enlighten men. In the parable of this Angel, by whom is signified the Lambe Iesus Christ, who is preached to the world; first is set downe the description of himselfe and his retinue; and then his warres. The parable is of acap. 19.11. horse, and his rider, as before in the sixth chapter. The horse doth signifie the speedy posting abroade of the Gospel, euen like lightning. And this horse is white for the honour and good opinion, and reputation the rider, and those that fol∣lowed
him did get among persons of honour, &c. He that sate vpon this white horse, was called (and reputed) faithfull and true; euery way sincere. Contrary to the dissi∣mulation of Antichrist, the Popes; who were so vnfaith∣full in their actions, and so false in their words and writings, that no man could safely trust what they said or did. He is also said to iudge and fight righteously; dealing vp∣rightly with all men, and iustly contending with his ene∣mies, by word and deede; so that he decideth all questions truely and rightly; and confuteth and impugneth his ad∣uersaries according to the precise rule of equitie. Contrary to the Popes, who decide all doubts, and fight all their bat∣tailes as may best serue their onely partialities and profites, without respect to iustice; and hereof are notoriously knowen to be guilty. His ability to iudge righteously appeareth by this, thatcap. 19.12. his eyes are as a flame of fire, by his cleere and piercing in∣sight, truely discerning the very secrets of all things, which he looketh vpon, euen as they be. Contrary to the Popes, whose ignorance, or malice maketh them vnable through∣ly to perceiue and see, much lesse to foresee things as they be; as appeareth by their continuall accusing of innocents, and acquiting of vngodly persons. And contrary to the popish Clergie, who know nothing, but what is reuealed to them by confession of such as neither will, nor can tell all; whereasHeb. 4.12.13. all things are naked and manifest to him, with whom we haue to doe, to wit, the word of God. As an argument of the iustnes of his warres and iudge∣ment, he hathcap. 19.12 many crownes on his head; signifying the su∣preme authority of the Scriptures to bee such, as that all Kings and Princes and people, are in right subiects there∣vnto; and so in this period shall acknowledge themselues to be; so that when he fighteth, it is to subdue his rebels. Affronting the wicked Antichristian Popes, who arrogantly
weare a triple crowne, vsurping authoritie and tyrannising ouer such as they haue no interest in, but are, and ought to be subiects of the word of God. Of the name of this rider, it is said, he hath a name written which no man knew but himselfe; to shew, that when the Popes, or others, do arrogate to themselues alone, the sense and vnderstanding of the Scriptures, as if they were to iudge thereof alone,Specul. Mino. tra. 3. f. 135. b. pretending to haue all knowledge and law in the cabenet of their owne breasts, they lie. For the written Scriptures, which are subiect to no Iudge, cannot be vnder∣stoode but by the helpe of themselues; speaking elsewhere more euidently, that which seemeth darke in any place. And hereof great persecution is to rise. Furthermore, he is saidcap. 19.13. to be clothed in a garment dipt in blood, to signifie the great effusion of bloud, by the martyr∣dome of such which should stand for the authority of the word of God against the beast Antichrist. For from hence∣forth, the great question is, of the authoritie, sufficiency, and vnderstanding of the Scriptures; about which are great con∣tentions and persecutions. His garment is also dipt in blood, to teach, that at lastIsai. 63.1.2.3. he shall victoriously triumph ouer his enemies, so as his gar∣ments shall be red with the blood of the slaine. This wonderfull person, in plaine tearmes, iscap. 19.13. the word of God; which though lately buried by the traditions, and ignorance, and malice of men, now commeth abroade againe. The retinue of this great and most mighty Generall, are said to be thecap. 19.14. hostes that are in heauen; that is, such godly men, as are come forth into Christian warfare; andPhil 3.20. haue their conuersation in heauen; and therefore those of his sidecap. 17.14. are called chosen and faithfull; professing the truth of the doctrine of vocation, election, and faith; contrary to the vocation, election, and faith of those which followed An∣tichrist; and therefore fought a good fight, vnder persecutions.
These followed him, keeping themselues in all doctrines, to the steppes of the word of God; speedily and honorably as vpon white horsescap. 19.14. clothed in fine linnen, white and pure, hauing put on the righteousnes of Christ, andDan. 12.10. being purified in the furnace of affliction. Of the manner of this riders fighting, it is said that his weapons are sure, and his confidence full of all assurance. Concerning his weapons, it is said, thatcap. 19.15. out of his mouth went a sharpe sworde; so mighty and strong, that with it, he should smite the heathen; signifying both the sharpe, and feruent, and mighty confutations of the wicked, which should be taken from the word of God; sufficient to con∣uince all the policy and superstition of the Gentiles, the papists, by a word of his mouth; and also the hot warres, which the preaching of the word should raise against Anti∣christ, and the remnant, &c. His confidence in this warre, is so great, that he doth giue assurance to all, that in the end HePsal. 2.9. shall rule the heathen with a rod of yron, keeping them vnder by seuere and mortall lawes. The reason of which assurance, is, that. He it is, that by the ordinance of almighty God treadeth the winepresse, as a seuere executioner of the fiercenes and wrath of almighty God, against all his enemies. First in token of his confidence, to triumph ouer all au∣thority, so that Kings, and Lords, &c. shall be his subiects, and seruants; hecap. 19.16. hath vpon his horsemans coate, or gar∣ment, a name written,cap. 17.14. The King of Kings and Lord of Lords. Secondly, to encourage his souldiers, and terrifie his ene∣mies, he causeth it to be generally proclaimed, or preached, as ifcap. 14.8. & 18.2. there followed an Angel, saying, Babylon, that great citie, is fallen; it is fallen, to that basenes; that whereas it was esteemed the seate and crowne of Kings and Princes; now it should become the habitation of diuels, and holde of all foule spirits, and a cage of euery vncleane, and hatefull bird.
The reasons of this fearefull iudgement, are first,cap. 18.3. because she made all nations to drinke of the wine of the wrath of her for∣nications; by diuerse interdictions, execrations, exactions, tumults, treasons, rebellions, murthers, massacres, &c, bring∣ing greiuous calamities vpon such, as refused to bee subiect vnto the idolatrie, superstitions, and other filthie constituti∣ons of that policicie, or citie. Secondly, because the kings of the earth haue committed fornication with her; giuing their power to be executioners of her fornication; which is the cause why the holy peo∣ple depart from the vngodly commaundements of them both. Thirdly, because the Marchants of the earth, are waxed rich of the abundance of such things which were gained by the marchandise of the word of God, and of the kingdome of heauen, &c. which were sold of her pleasures, as pleased her to bestow them. For now were sold both Sacraments, and Church, and heauen. They doe also abound in plea∣sures. Now because of this abundant riches, and fatnes of the great and princely Marchants; followeth as a third argu∣ment of this riders confidence; namely a publike procla∣mation to all sorts of greedy people, to take away the li∣uings of the popish Clergie, be they great or small. And to this purposecap. 19.17.18. Saint Iohn saith, I saw an Angel stand in the sunne, that is openly in all mens fight, who cryed with a loud voyce, by preaching and teaching, and saying, it is lawfull to all the fowles that did flie by the middest of heauen; euen all couetous, hungrie, and needy persons which were in estima∣tion with Princes, &c. to gather themselues together vn∣to the supper of the great God, which he had prepared by the hands of the popish prouiders and builders; who had cooked their liuings for gentlemens mouthes, &c. That they may eate the flesh, euen the fatte liuings of such as were
aduanced in the world as Kings, and the flesh of high cap∣taines: namely the Cardinals and Abbots, &c. who now be∣came Generalles of warres, &c. Contrarily, on the other side, the deputies of the Dragon, the diuel, namelycap. 19.19. the beast, the popish policy, and the Kings, the tenne principalities which inhabited the two third parts of the earth, formerly subiect to the Romane Em∣pire, and their hast of iudges, inquisitors, secular arme of fa∣miliars, executioners and souldiers, &c. gathered themselues together to make warre against the word of God, which sate vp∣on the horse, and against his armie, all those faithfull people, which did stand for the authority and sense of the Scrip∣tures. The successe of this bloudie fight, is begun in this chap∣ter, but finished afterwards, and is, that the lambe and they that are on his side, though firstcap. 13.10. ouercome; yet by patience, in the ende doe ouercome the Kings, that warre against him. For the beast,cap. 19.20. which consisted of the Romane policie the Hie∣rarchie, with the Princes, their aides; was taken, so conui∣cted by the equitie of the cause of innocentes, that they were able but onlie to answere like a rauenous beast, viz, to gnashe vpon the saintes, &c. With the beast is also taken the false Prophet, which de∣ceaued the world, with lying reuelations; to wit, the Friers, Monkes, Popes &c; which gloried in this kinde of vanitie, and all their subtile and scholasticall sophistrie profited not: but was sifted and confuted so effectually, as that they were not able to make it appeare to be the truth: yea that false Prophet is taken which wrought false miracles and ly∣ing signes before the beast, the Princes, whereby he deceiued them that receiued the beasts marke; his superstition and armes, and deceiued them that worshiped his Image, esteeming the Hierarchie as a God. All their iugling is knowne and detested.
The meanes by which the false Prophet is taken, is, thecap. 20.1. restraining the diuell, the lying spirit in the mouth of wic∣ked prophets, and by the setting vp of true iustice, accor∣ding to the word of God. In the prophecie of the diuels captiuitie, first the person is shewed, by whose ministrie it is done, who is said to becap. 18.1. and 20.1. The Angel that came downe from heauen, hauing great power to declare the power of almightie God. Secondly are shewed the instruments which he vsed in this waightie worke: first, The key of the bottomlesse pit: name∣ly, the true and faithfull opening of the doctrine of hell and damnation, as it is set downe in the word of God; farre dif∣ferent, if not contrarie to the doctrine of hell and purgato∣rie, &c. as it is deliuered by Antichrist. Secondly, he hath a great chaine in his hand, that is,Psal. 149.8.9 the doctrine of the iudgements of God, as it is written; different from that which Antichrist doeth teach of binding and loosing. Now by these two meanes, (the Lord togither working mightily)cap. 20.2. he appre∣hended the Dragon, that is, manifestly prooued that the su∣perstition of the Gentils brought into the Christian Church by the Popes, was abhominable. This Dragon was the olde serpent, euen the same that by his subtiltieGen. 3.1. &c. beguiled Eue; and now againe by lying signes and reuelations, and by so∣phisticall schoole-learning, deceiueth the world. Hee is the Diuell, and not the spirit of God in the mouthes of popish Prophets: and Sathan an aduersarie, alwaies an enemie to the good of mankinde, especially to the Saints in their pro∣phecie; now reuiuing the persecutions which their ancestors the Gentiles and Arians vsed against the truth. This wicked spirit of the Antichristian prophets, is bound by restraint, by the power of God, andcap. 20.3. cast into the bottom∣lesse pit; all men assuring themselues that the spirit of popish prophets is the diuell of hell, who now is shut vp, and sealed, that he should deceiue the people no more; but that al the sleights
of Antichrist should bee as manifest, as was the madnesse of2. Tim. 3.8.9 Iannes and Iambres. The iudgement also vpon the beast, and the false prophet, which are the whole bodie of Antichrist, is, thatcap. 19.20. they both were cast aliue into the lake of fire burning with brimstone; not onely knowne to belong to hell, but in the meane time, see∣ing plagues, like vnto those of Sodome. For the Princes henceforth doe beginne tocap. 17.16. hate the whore for her inuentions, wil-worships, and idolatries, &c. and make her desolate, forsaking her; and naked, taking from her her costly ornaments; and eate her flesh, by taking away her large reuenewes; and burne her with fire, like Sodom in the end of her iudgements. The time of which destruction, appeareth by the compu∣tation of the raigne of Antichrist, namely, 1260. yeres, from the time of Pelagius, the angel of the bottomlesse pit, to bee neere the yeare of Christ, 1820. As touching the restoring of Christian iustice, & the true administration thereof, according to the word of God: first S. Iohn doth say,cap. 20.4. And I saw thrones for iudgement, and they that were fit sate vpon them, administring iustice in iudge∣ment, according to the truth, and not according to appea∣rance or partialitie: contrarie to Antichrist,cap. 13.2. to whom the dra∣gon gaue his power, and his throne, and great authoritie; that af∣ter the1. Pet. 5.8. example of the diuell, hee, by his inquisitors, &c. might goe about, seeking whom he might deuoure. Before these thrones the principal question that is hand∣led, is, the cause of such godly men, called by the scripture phrase, soules Act. 7.14. cap. 20.4. that were as capitally punished, as if they were beheaded, not for treason, but for the witnesse of Iesus, and for the word of God; as also, because that following the word of God, they did not worship the beast, the ciuill tyrannie; nor his image, the Hierarchie of Rome: neither had taken his marke of superstition; which causes, the iniquitie of the times
held equall to treason, if not worse. The sentence that was giuen at these iudgement seats of this cause, was first, that they which haue suffered as the Mar∣tyrs of Christ, and for the word of God, and because they would not worship the beast, nor his image, nor take the superstitious marke of Antichrist, shall liue, in the persons of such as here∣after shall professe the same things. For the cause shall be ad∣iudged to deserue life, and not death, and therefore shall be defended from the tyrannie of Antichrist, by such as truely administer iustice. Yea such also shall raigne with Christ, as worthy that office, honour, and soueraigntie which is fitting a true Christian man. The second member of the iudgement is,cap. 20.5. that the rest of the dead men, which haue died in the defence of the tyrannie of the Antichristian Popes, shall not liue againe in the Church; but shall bee iustly reputed to be in hell, for their sinnes of treason, &c. whereas such as professe the cause of the Mar∣tyrs,cap. 20.6. are blessed, and holy, hauing their part in the first resurre∣ction of the Gospel, from the darkenes in which it was buri∣ed by Antichrist; for on such the second death hath no power, howsoeuer Antichrist doe threaten no lesse than purgatorie and hell to such. Yea they shall bee as the holy people of God, who are called aExod. 19.6. 1. Pet. 2.9. royall Priesthood. For they shall be kings and Priests vnto God, and of Christ, and shall raigne with him. Hereupon thecap. 18.9. &c. 15. Princes, and Merchants, and Ship-men, namely the officers of the popish gaine, shall lament and howle, but yet shall prouide for their safetie, standing farre off from the danger. But20. &c. the Saints shall reioyce and triumph for the destruction of Antichrist, that is cast into hel, like a mil∣stone into the sea. Thecap. 19.21. remnant also shall be slaine with the sword of him that sate vpon the horse; namely, the Turkes shall be conuicted by the power of the scriptures, when Anti∣christ is cast to hell: and then shall be fulfilled that which is
written, TheDan. 8.14. & 7.27. sanctuaries shall be clensed; and againe, And the kingdome and dominion and greatnesse of the kingdome vn∣der the whole heauen shall be giuen to the holy people of the most high, whose kingdome is an euerlasting kingdome, and all powers shall serue and obey him. The continuance of this period, from the reuiuing of the Gospel to the next enemies, is 1000. yeare: so long shall the Gospel come abroad, get the victory, and flourish in his due season; and so long shall men condemne the crueltie of An∣tichrist. And these 1000. yeares are to beginne, where theDan. 12.11. 1290. yeres spoken of by Daniel doe ende; namely, in the yeare of Christ 1364. whence we are to reckon the first re∣surrection.

In the time of this Wickleife, Ann.411. 412. 413 in signis 7. 1364. on the fourth sonday in Ad∣uènt, Nicolaus Orem preached at Rome before the Pope and his Cardinals; that the tribulationcap. 18.3.23. and fall of the Church was at hand, for her excessiue wickednesse hauing gotten the face of an harlot, that cannot blush. For that her Marchants which sell both Church and Sacraments, were the great men of the earth, exceeding all Princes of the earth. For pride, ty∣rannie,
for despising correction, and hating them that tell the truth: (euen the professors of the Gospell:) and that there∣fore the people were in commotions, and many thinke to doe sacrifice to God, if they may robbe and spoile certaine fatte Priests, &c. (for the fowles are called to eate the flesh of kings, &c.)415.

Then hee said to the Archbishop of Mogunce, My Lord Archbishop, we command you vpon your oath of fi∣delitie, that you reforme your Clergie, &c. And if they will not be reformed, that you command the fruits of their be∣nefices to be taken from them, and presented to our Exche∣quer, and we will conuert it to more godly vses.

He conuerted many from their vngodly life, and held a congregation. Catharina Senensis spake of the reformati∣on of the Church; Mathew Paris noteth the Pope to be An∣tichrist, Henricus de Iota, Henricus de Hassia, who writeth out of a prophecie of Hildegrade, that the diuell spake of the Priests of this time, daintie bankets and feastes wherein is all voluptuousnesse, doe I finde among these men, &c.

For money he made Iubiles to be held, not onely in great cities, but also in base places.Geneb. p. 1048 The king of England bounded the Popes authoritie at the Ocean sea; so that no English man vnder paine of perpetuall imprisonment, should deale with the Pope, to excommu∣nicate any in England. Against this Pope sate Benedict the thirteenth, vnto whomVincent. prog. part. 1. & 2. Saint Vincentius submitted his booke, and doctrine of his prognostication of Antichrist, and of the ende of the world. In which booke, though there be many things fabulous and false, after the manner of all
the Friers in their prophecies: yet there be also some things worth the marking; as of the ruine of the popish Prelates, of Antichrist mixt, which must be a Pope; of the abhominable life of the Friers, and the falshood of Francis prophecie, of his order, &c. InFox Mart. p. 446. &c. 456. 457. &c. the time of this Pope Boniface were many constant confessors of the truth, as Swinderbie, who was per∣secuted for beeing earnest against the wicked liues of Friers, and Priests of his time; refused the popish iudgement, & ap∣pealed to the kings iustice, because the Pope was Antichrist. And Water Brute, who most excellently interpreteth the mysticall numbers in Daniel, and prooueth the Pope to bee Antichrist. TheFasc. Temp. opinions of Wickleife in England, Hus, and Ierom of Prage in Boemia, doe spread amongst many.

FromPee. 5. f. 157. &c. 168. this time to the Councell of Constance, continued the schisme amongst the Popes; there beeing sometimes three at once, and euery one raging against the other, with cursings, &c. to the great griefe, perplexitie, and destruction of Christian men.See Fox Martyr. It was also a time of great persecution of
the Gospel, whose professors were many, learned, godly and constant. Peuc. 5. f. 155. &c.In the yeare 1400. was proclaimed a Iubile, to bee held at Rome. Against which, Hus did teach, that the true Iubile was in preaching of Iesus Christ; that the Pope and Cardi∣nals bee not the Church; the institution of Christ is to bee kept; there ought not to bee any worshipping of Saints; the Popes decrees are not to be admitted, &c. At this time was an extreame famine in Italie.Epit. Blond. And thus the first resurrection appeareth. CHAP XI. The warres begunne at the first resurrection are continued, &c. And the resurrection is more manifest. NOw is come that blessed time which the ProphetDan. 12.12. Daniel spoke of, namely, 1335. daies, that is, yeres after the destruction of Ierusalem, which was in the yeare of Christ, 74. At which time is a more cleare demon∣stration of the first resurrection. For here also doe ende thosecap. 12.6. 1260. daies, that is yeares, to be reckoned from the tenth yeare of Antonius Pius, which was in the yeare of Christ, 149. when the woman the Church fled into the wildernesse, af∣ter shee had brought forth many contagious professors, as a man childe. During which time shee remained confusedly a∣mongst the wicked, as in a wildernesse full of Dragons and Ostriches. But nowDan. 12.2. many that were as sleeping, and dead in the dust, doe rise vp to euerlasting life, and their cause doth come abroad by the reuiuing of the Gospel. Here therefore is continued the first resurrection, and the warre betweene the word of God, and the hostes in heauen that follow∣ed him: against the beast, and the kings of the earth. And here is
that blessed time, in which the witnesses doe separate them∣selues from the kingdome of Antichrist. The meanes by which they separate themselues from Antichrist, the beast, is said to be, that those of the spirit of Saint Iohncap. 18 4. heard a voyce from heauen, to wit, from the Church of God, in the persons of his witnesses, who had learned the doctrine of saluation of the God of heauen, out of his word, and also had spread it abroade in the world. The doctrine is a commaundement from God, the same which was giuen to theIsai. 48.20. Ier. 51.6. Zach. 2.6. Isralites, that were in the captiui∣tie of Babylon. Goecap. 18.4. out of her my people, that ye be not par∣takers of her sinnes, and that ye receiue not of her plagues. For now the people of God doe see, that she that tooke vpon her to forgiue others their sinnes, is not able herselfe to escape the damnation of hel, nor those other plagues, which euery man foresaw would light vpon her for her owne sinnes. The cause why men should flie from her, is, forcap. 18.5. that the heapes of her sinnes doe reach vp to heauen; being infinit and prodigious, euen fighting against the God of heauen; and ascending like the sins of Sodom and Egypt. As also because that God hath remembred her iniquities, to take vengeance of them, as he did of Sodom and Egypt. For these two witnesses are GodsGen. 18.21. & 19.5. Exod. 2.7. messengers, to make experience whether the sins of Antichrist be as it is reported, and henceforth principally detect her sinnes and reproue them. The plagues are first proclaimed, and then required to be executed. And this Proclamation is made as by the thirdcap. 14.9. &c. Angel which followed them that before first reuiued the preaching of the eternall Gospel, and threatned the fall of Babylon. He mightily bringeth in the doctrine of vengeance to be infli∣cted vpon Antichrist; as if he said with a loud voyce. If any man worship the beast, of hereticall monarches; and his image,
the papacie, and receiue his marke in his forehead, or in his hand, following those superstitions; henceforth the same shall drinke of the wine of the wrath of God; yea of the pure wine which is powred into the cup of his wrath, and he shall be tor∣mented in fire and brimstone, before the holy Angels, and before the Lambe. And the smoke of their torment shall ascend euer∣more, and they shall haue no rest night or day that worship the beast and his image, and whosoeuer receiueth the print of his name. Here12. cap. 13.10. are the fruites of the patients of the Saints; and here ar they that keepe the commaundements of God, and the faith of Iesus, the executioners of the fiercenes of the wrath of almighty God. That which is required to be executed, is, that the Saints, who hitherto haue been persecuted, should take the sworde in hand, andap. 18.6. reward her, to wit popish Babylon, as she hath re∣warded them, and giue her double, according to her workes; in the cup that she hath filled, fill her the double. For now begin∣neth the execution of that which is promised.cap. 13.10. If any leade into captiuitie, he shall goe into captiuitie; If any man kill with the sword, he must be killed by a sword. She must also be tormented for her pleasures and pride,cap. 18.7. For she saith in her heart, I sit being a Queene, of all other Churches, and shall see no mourning; the ship of Peter in which I sit may be tossed, but it shall not sinke. As these things are threatned, so8. shall (in due time) her plagues come in one day, together; death, sorrow and famine, and she shall be burnt with fire, for that God which condemneth her, is a strong God. During the time of which executions, if any died in the cause against Antichrist; they are Martyrs; as it is said of all men in the Church of God.cap. 14.13. Then I heard a voyce from heauen saying vnto me, write, the dead that die in the Lord, are henceforth fully blessed, euen so saith the spirit, whose testimo∣nie
is true, and no lie; for they rest from their labours, neuer feeling the terror of the second death, or purgatory, by the execration of Antichrist. And their workes follow them, to re∣ceiue a crowne at the throne of God. This testimonie beeing thus finished, and continually preached by the two witnesses, and of many beleeued,cap. 11.7. The beast that commeth out of the bottomlesse pit, maketh warre a∣gainst them, and ouercommeth them, for a while. The beast that commeth out of the bottomlesse pit, is (as hath been shewed before) the politike body of poperie, consi∣sting of the Pope and his Clergie; assisted with those tenne kingdomes and principalities, which did arise after the wounding of the Empire to death. All which grew to be an vnited body by the doctrine of purgatory, and deliue∣ring of the dead from paine, which doctrine the Popes in∣uented. This beast doth warre vpon the Martyres of Christ, not onely as barbarously, as wilde beasts doe rampe vpon men; but also as wickedly, as if the diuell himselfe came from the bottomlesse pit, in his owne person, to deuoure the godly. The successe of this warre is doubtfull. For first,7. the beast doth ouercome the witnesses, and after that it selfe is first to be frighted, of which is spoken in this chapter; and then to be vexed, captiued, and killed; of which the text hath been partly interpreted in the former chapter, in the general view of this period; the rest will be seene in the next chapter, to wit, how he is vexed. The victory of the beast appeareth, both by the death of these two witnesses whom the beast doth kill; and also by his triumphing ouer them. Concerning their death, the beast will haue it so, thatcap. 11.8. their corpes shall be killed in the streetes, or open places of the great citie of their Antichristian policie. For as at this time, so from hence they burne the Martyres, in their greatest and
most famous cities. But the citie where this cruelty is com∣mitted, is not a place where any good people be, that may lament the persecutions of the Saints,Theod. 4. 22. as when the Arians persecuted the Catholikes. But this city is it, which spiritu∣ally in a figuratiue speech borrowed from the most abho∣minable cities and places mentioned in the Scriptures, is called Sodom; because the two witnesses are assaulted for the pollution of their spirits, as the Sodomits did striue to pollute mens bodies; and because reprouing the filthines of the Antichristian citizens, they found no more fauour, thenGen. 19.9. Lot did in Sodom. It is also called Egypt, for theirEzech. 16.26 vn∣speakeable idolatry, and for the spirituall seruitude that all men were in to the papacy, worse then the Egyptians, or Isralites were to Pharaoah; but especially because the Popes had commaunded the Bishops and inquisitors to kill all godly preachers, and hearers; and by name the two wit∣nesses; asExod. 1.16. Pharaoh commaunded the Midwiues to kill the male children of the Iewes. It is also called Egypt, because the message of Iesus Christ, in the mouthes of the two wit∣nesses, was there despised, asExod. 5.2. Moses and Aron were di∣spised by Pharaoh, when they made mention of the Lord, &c. Moreouer the place is said to be where our Lord also was crucified; to signifie that the same policy that crucified Christ, did also kill his Martyrs; and by name these two witnesses. Thus distinguishing this beast from the Turkes; and shewing that howsoeuer the popish religion, in name is distinguished from the Romane heathen crueltie; yet in deede, spiritually, it is the same without material difference. The manner of their killing, farre exceedeth the manner of their ancestors the Arians, whose image they be. For theSoc. 2. 23. Theod. 2. 14. Arians did hide the bodies of them whom they had kil∣led; but here, they of the people, and kindreds,cap. 11.9. and tongues, and gentiles, doe see, or gaze vpon their corpes; the better to satisfie their cruell eyes. Not for an houre, but for three
dayes and a halfe, that is, three yeares and a halfe, their bar∣barous bloody eyes were vnsatiable. Yet like Arians, or rather like the Gentiles, whose image they be,Theod. 2. 14. Eus. 5. 1. . p. 62. they shall not suffer their carcasses to be put in Momments. Afterwards in triumph, the inhabitants of the earth, euen the people of all the christian earth, whose gouernors more regarded the possession of the earth, then the getting of heauen,cap. 11.10. reioyce ouer them whom they haue slaine, as their fathersTheod. 4. 22. the Ari∣ans did ouer the Catholikes, and they be glad, and send gifts one to another in token of happie victory. For these two prophets, after the example of Moses, and Elias, and the rest of the prophets, by the word of the Lord,1. King. 8.17 vexed them that dwell vpon the earth; by reprouing their carnall religion, earthly policies, and worldly sinfull liues. And thus farre the beast getteth the vpper hand. Howbeit, the cause of the Gospel maintained by these witnesses, is reuiued. For not∣withstanding this triumph,cap. 11.11. after three dayes and a halfe; that is, three yeeres and a halfe, the spirit of life, comming from God, shall enter into them, which were killed; and they, by the meanes of them whom God shall raise vp to defend their cause, shall, as it were, stand vp vpon their feete. The effect which followeth, when their cause is againe set on foote, is, that great feare shall come vpon them, which be∣ing their enemies, did see or gaze vpon their corpes. First they feare because their cause on the contrary part was so much affected by their friends, and so earnestly pur∣sued to their holy praise and eternall commendations, that whereas the beast had accursed them as diuels, to the bot∣tomlesse pit, they are as truly honored for Martyres, as ifcap. 11.12. they heard a great voyce from heauen, euen from all godly men saying vnto them, come vp hither and receiue the crowne prouided for holy Martyres. And hereupon, they being the true members, and Martyrs of Iesus Christ, who after his sufferings and death, did ascend
vp to heauen in a cloud, are acknowledged, through him, in soule to ascend vp to him, as truely, as if they had ascended in a cloud. And whereas ChristAct. 1.9. did ascend in the presence of his Apostles, and friends; these doe ascend, that euen their very enemies do see them accompted to be gone to heauen. The second cause of their feare, is, by reason thatcap. 11.13. at the same houre or instant, when this due regard is giuen to these two witnesses, which were thus wickedly murthered, there was a great earthquake, and emotion in the hearts and hands of many, mooued by the indignitie of their death. And this earthquake and emotion bred this effect, that both one tenth part, or kingdome, of the great citie, of popish policie, fell from them; and also, that in those troubles, called by the name of an earthquake, are slaine to the number of 7000; that is, very many. But are therefore called 7000. be∣cause the beast doth blaspheme them that brought these troubles vpon him; accompting those Papists, and Priests, which worshipped the beast, and were slaine in the emoti∣on, as the 7000. which bowed not the knee to Baall, and were persecuted by Ahab. Another effect of the reuiuing of their cause, is, thatcap. 11.13. the remnant, the other nine kingdoms, of the polititians, which held with the beast, are also sore feared, euen as the wicked, that fled when none followed: and as the souldiers of the ArianSoc. 5. 14. Maximus, fled for feare vpon the rumour of the comming of Theodosius, the true Christian Prince. Albeit the rest of the Arians presumed and reported Theodosius to be defeated, whence the Papists haue learned to spread presumptuous lying newes. Howbeit at last, euen for feare, they giue glorie to the God of heauen. TheseFox in hunc locum. things do most aptly agree vnto the times of the preaching, and martyrdome of Iohn Hus, and Ierom of Prage, &c. before, and at the Councell of Constance, and to the effects that followed thereupon.
The complement. Alexander the fifthFox Mart. p. 531. 567. was chosen Pope to take away the schisme. In his time the Boemians,Anno 1409. by the preaching of Iohn Hus, &c, encreased much in the knowledge of the Gospel: for before this time, by the spreading of Wickliefes bookes, they began to tast and sauour of it.Peuce. 5. f. 156. 157. The summe of his preaching was a reprehension of the fornication, coue∣tousnes and pride of the Priests &c, and against the magicke consecrations, of the oyle, water &c. He prooued his asserti∣ons by the word of God, the holy scriptures; vnto which alone he would reduce all doctrine. Hereupon grew contentions in the Vniuersitie of Prage. And when those which did striue for the Pope, were not able to resist the founde testi∣monies of the scripture, alleadged by Hus, they left the Vni∣uersitie.Fox Mart. 532 When the Pope heard of these preachings and disputations, he sent his bull vnto the Archbishop, requiring him to looke that no such things were maintained; and ci∣ted Iohn Hus to appeare before him. Iohn Hus answereth, the Bull to be contrary to the doings and examples of Christ and his Apostles; and to restreine (or fight against) the free course of the word of God. (Wherefore he appealeth from this mandate, to the same Pope better aduised. But as hee was prosecuting of his appeale, the Pope died, there died also the Archbishop &c,cap. 11.5. by the fire that proceeded out of the mouth of Christs witnesses, &c. Iohn the twentieth three,Gobel. aet. 6. cap. 90.94. a diuell incarnate,Anno 1410. and a most profound inuentor of all sorts of infamous wickednes: most rigorous. He receiued of the harlots of one citie, viz Bne∣nia, 300. florens euery moneth, for tribute of their whore∣dome, &c. The King of Sicilia brake into Rome, which the Pope not forseeing, with many Curtizans was spoyled. Vn∣toFox Mart. p. 567. this Pope (or rather beast) was Hus accused for an here∣tike; because he seemed rather willing to preach the Gos∣pell, then the bishops traditions. The Pope committeth the
matter to the Cardinall of Columna, who monished Hus to appeare at Rome. Wenceslaus King of Romanes, and Boem, at the suite of his wife, the whole nobilitie, citie, and Vniuer∣sitie of Prage, sent Ambassadors to Rome, crauing the Pope, to remit the citation of Hus, and to determine his cause in Boem. Hus also sent proctors to Rome to purge him, because he would auoid that dangerous iourney. The Cardinall at Rome, notwithstanding the Kings petition, excōmunicateth Hus, and emprisoneth some of his proctors; so that the rest returne without doing any thing. Howbeit Hus, notwith∣standing his excommunication, goeth on in preaching; and appealed from the Pope to Christ. YeaFox Mart. 569. when the Popes bull came to Prage, proclaiming full remission of sinnes, to all such as would fight on his side (for the Pope had warre with the king of Naples). Hus, and his followers, manifest∣ly spake against the Bull, three lay men were beheaded for speaking against these pardons; whom Hus, and such Priests as fauoured him, interred sumptuouslie, saying; These be the Saints, which for the Testament of God, did giue their bodies. AtPeuce. 5. f. 168. this time were three Popes at once, euery one fighting against the other with condemnations, and execrations. But asSocr. 5. 22. the Arians, did not striue for religion, but by rea∣son of their ouermuch desire of honour, with which their mindes were wholy possessed, did fight among themselues for the primacie, whereupon many of the Clergie, hating the contention sprung of the desire of vaine glory, departed from them, to the antient faith: so these did not striue for the glorie of the sonne of God, or for the mending of such corruptions, as were in manners and doctrine; but for the principalitie. (Wherefore many departed from them.) When the Emperor Sigismund did see, that these euils would be more duly reformed by a Councel, than by armes, hee hauing runne ouer Italy, Spaine, France, and England with in∣credible speede, and wonderfull patience, in great labours,
by consent of the kings, caused the Counsell of Constance to bee1414. decē. 3. assembled, which was frequented with the pre∣sence, or Legates of the Princes of all the Christian world; as also thither came from Bizantium, and Trapezuntium, a concourse of most diuersecap. 11.9. people, and kindreds, and tongues, and gentiles,Geneb. p. 1059 so that there were numbred of strangers of all sorts, 60,500. AfterGobel. 6. c. 94 the Councell assembled, the whole affaires of the Councell were committed to the determination of foure Prelates, chosen out of foure Nations: which much displea∣sed the Pope, and his Cardinals. In this Councell, they pro∣posed to reforme the Church, in the head and members.Peut. 5. f. 175. Wherefore Petrus de Aliaco, very grauely admonished the Councell of the most corrupt conditions of the Popes, the court of Rome, and of al degrees of the Romane Church; for the citie is Sodom. He also admonished the Councell of the many superstitions, and of the tyrannie then vsed: for this citie is also Aegypt.Specul. Minor. Tract. 3. f. 167. &c. There were also proposed diuerse complaints against the friers, for their (Sodomiticall) filthie life: and for their pride, and crueltie: who were like ruffians and cutters, to kill them that admonished them of their faults;Exod. 2.11.13.14. worse then the Aegyptian that wronged the Israelite, or the Israelite that reproched Moses, or the Sodomites that railed on Lt. The like was done by other that desired re∣formation. In this CouncellMass. 18. p. 255. Gobel 6.94. the PopeFox. Mart. p. 604. in epist. Huss. whom the Preach∣ers were wonte to call the God of the earth, was conuicted of more than fortie grieuous crimes, for which hee was de∣posed. VntoFox in hunc locum & Mar. 1575. &c. this Councell came Iohn Hus, vnder the safe con∣duct of the Emperour; and there continued vnder the war∣rantie of the Popes promise; and thither was Hierom of Prage cited. Those two were shut vp in most horrible and filthie prisons, (farre worse then sackcloth.) When Hus came to the Councell, he desired leaue to answere the obiections
brought against him. But (whereas Christ, was not only permitted, but also required to answere for himselfe before Pilate) he was commaunded to hold his peace. Wherefore in that confusion hee cried out, confirming his assertions by scripture, and appealed from that wicked synagogue to Christ. He reproued the corrupt manners of this assembly, and had the same regard which Lot had in Sodom, when he reprooued their violence. Howbeit, contrarie to the Emperours safe conduct, and to the Popes promise, he was condemned to the fire (Beware of men for they shall deli∣uer you vp to the Councels) For now is fulfilled the prophe∣cie of the2. Tim. 3.1.3 Peucer. 5. f. 176. &c. last time,Mat. 10.17. which should bee perilous, for truce∣breakers. His garments were taken from him, as Christ had his; he was crowned with a paper Miter,Mat. 10.25. with painted diuels, as Christ was with thornes. If they call the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more them of the householde? The principall cause of his condemnation was the same that the Arians obiected to Athanasius.Soc. 2. 5. Athanasius was accused, because when he was remoued from his ministerie, he tooke it againe, without the consent of the Councell. And HusFox Mart. p. 603. was not onely accused by this Councell, (the liuely image of the Arians) but also condemned; because he continued preaching, when he was excommunicated. Also Ierom of Prage was likewise vsed. Before their death, they prophecied. For Hus, who in the Boemian tongue doth sig∣nifie a Goose, prophecied, that after him should come a Swan, whō they should not burne so easily. And Ierom cited the Councell, after an hundred yeres, to answere God, and him. These prophecies doe seeme accomplished in Luther. Before their execution,Orig in Ephe. was a fearefull eclipse of the Sunne. For the Starres were seene, as in the night; and the birds by the suddaine darknes fell to the grounde. HusBuchol. ann. 1415. and Prage were condemned by the Councell; and by them committed to the ciuill Magistrate, to be put to death.
For they themselus, as theIoh. 18.31. Iewes cried to Pilate, might not lawfully put any man to death. But when they were dead, they would not grant as much fauour to their ashes, asIoh. 10.1. Pilate did to the bodie of Christ, to be put in graues, butEus. 5. 1 p. 62. they strawed their ashes in the Rhine, as the Gentiles did the Christians into the riuer of Rhodanus, to take away all hope of their resurrection. The memorie also of Iohn Wickleife was condemned. For it was decreed, that his bones should bee taken out of his graue, herein shewing themselues more cruell and vnnatu∣rall, then were the Arians against the Catholiques. Mass. 18. p. 255 Pope Martine, and the Emperour reioyced together: because that at the last, peace was restored to the Church. For these two vexed them that dwell vpon the earth. So did theTheod. 4. 22. Arians reioyce, when they had oppressed the innocent Catholiques. TheFox Mart. p. 575. Pope gaue gifts also. For he gaue full ab∣solution to all that were present at the Councell; and also hee gaue another indulgence at the houre of death, to the masters and household. But so as the pardons must bee procured vnder seale, that they may giue gifts one to an∣other. InGob. ae. 6. cap. vlt. this Councell, was no reformation of doctrine and manners.Caranza. The institution of Christ and practise of the Pri∣mitiue Church in the ministration of the Sacrament, of both kinds, was antiquated: yet do they boast of antiquitie.

Councell continued three yeere and a halfe; which the Scriptures call in a propheticall speech, three dayes and a halfe. This Pope Martine is repor∣ted to haue dispensed with a man to marrie his sister.Fasc. Temp. p. 87. 88. So corrupt were the times, that of them it is said, that conscience according to the feare of God, abounding in times past in the Prelates, did by laudable manners and examples, set vp and aduance the Church of Christ. In processe of time,
abounding with temporalties, forgetting conscience, they trusted vpon science, which maketh proud; palliating the holy Scriptures with diuers impostures, not fearing to fal∣sifie the iustice of the Lord, &c. But (O abhomination) con and sci, are raised out of conscience, and onely (entia) vnsen∣sible creatures, which neither haue knowledge nor consci∣ence, doe gouerne the spouse of Christ, &c.

Vrsp. p. 381. these Martyres were killed by the Councell, the spirit of life comming from God, entred into the witnesses. For first threescore, then fifty & foure of the Nobles of Boem wrote to the Councell, by their letters patents; shewing themselues to be wronged in the death and cause of Hus; and testified that they would defend the preaching of the word of God, with the hazard of their liues, &c. and so fulfill the precept:cap. 18.4.

The Boemians assemble, and celebrate the memorie of Hus, and Prage, as of great Martyres ascended to heauen; and decree the same yeerely to be kept. And because the Pope had thundred, and that with the Princes hee re∣solued to send armies against them, the Boemians chose Zisca for their Generall; and so began the Boemians warre for Hus, &c. which may iustly be compared to a great earth∣quake. In this emotion, Zisca winneth much.1420. Bucholcerus.

In this Councell was acknowledged, that the preaching of the Gospell ought to bee free, and faithfull. Sinne ought to be punished. The Boemians might receiue the Sacrament of the Supper in both kindes.

And now thecap. 11.14. se∣cond woe to the inhabitants of the earth, by the Turkes, &c. seemeth to be past. But the third woe will come anon. CHAP. XII. Of the third cap. 11.14. woe to the inhabitants of the earth by Kings con∣uerted to Christ. WE are now come to speake of the third woe, which shal be inflicted vpon the inhabitants of the earth; namely such which doe rather desire to possesse the earth, then to inherit heauen. And this containeth the abolishing of the kingdome of Antichrist; and the victori∣ous reigne and triumph of the word of God. That which is spoken hereof, is comprehended in the doctrine which came abroad, whencap. 11.15. the seuenth Angell blew the trumpet. The summe whereof is manifestly knowne, and euidently
spoken, by all godly men, as if there were great voyces in hea∣uen, expressing their assurance of the things that are to come to passe. And the summe is this, that certainelie it can not be, but the kings will also be conuerted to the Gospell by whose onely and holy administrations The kingdomes of this world are (to be) our Lords, and his Christs and he shall reigne for euermore. Hereupon all godly magistrates and ministers, called by the name of thecap. 11.16. foure and twentie elders, which make any consciecne of their places, as those which sit before God on their seates; First, doe humble themselues euen falling on their faces, and subiecting themselues to this kind of administration. Secondly, they doe also leaue the seruice of idols and men, and in their places worship God, both with praises, and administration of iustice. As for their praises, they do in effect, say,cap. 11.17. we giue thee thankes Lord God almightie, which art, and which wast, and which art to come; euen the same God which art euerlasting, for that taking the power out of the hands of mortall, weake, and mutable men, who of long time haue trodden thy sanctuarie vnder foote, thou hast receiued (the entrance and possession of) thy great might, and hast obtained thy king∣dome, in due time to bee fully and alone administred by thee. As for their sincere administration of iustice, they shew that they so regard the faithfull profession of the Gospell, that thereupon, such which rather professed the vanitie of the Gentiles, then Christ, (euen the Antichristian Papists) werecap. 11.18. angrie. The cause of their anger is, first, that the time is come of the wrath of God, to be inflicted vpon whosoeuer shall de∣serue it; without respect of persons. Secondly, because they see that the time is come of the dead, which haue been martyred, for the witnes of Iesus;
that they should be iudged, whether they died as innocents or not; so that the proceedings against such come to be looked into and examined againe by iustice faithfully, which they are angrie should be knowen. Thirdly, because that God hath raised vp Christian Kings, that God by them should giue rewarde vnto his seruants, the prophets, which doe sincerely speake the truth from the Lord; whereas Antichrist did tread them vnder foote. Yea, because the time was come, that he by Princes should giue reward also to the Saints, and to them that (in deede) doe feare his name to small and great, whom Antichrist exposed to death and confiscation, loading them with reproches, &c. Fourthly, because the time is come, that God by Princes should vtterly destroy them, which destroy the earth, be they Turkes or Papists. The aduancement of the godly, and destruction of the wicked, according to the exact rule of iustice, in the word of God, being thus drifted by godly Gouernors; those of the spirit of Saint Iohn,cap. 15.1. saw another great and marueilous signe in heauen, the Church of God. Namely, that God hath pre∣pared seuen Angels, hauing the seuen last plagues, which he would inflict vpon his enemies, for, not by men, but by them, euen by a diuine hand, is now to be fulfilled the wrath of God. Of these plagues, we are to consider the place whence these Angels doe receiue them, and the powring of them forth. These plagues are deliuered vnto them in the temple; which, after the godly doe put on zeale and thankesgiuing, is opened. Concerning the zeale of the godly, first is declared how the true doctrine of Christian baptisme is restored, namely that Christians ought to be vndefiled, and zealous in the cause of Christ. For the lauer of regeneration is now figured
cap. 15.2. by a glassie sea mingled with fire, godly Princes and peo∣ple, being baptisedMat. 3.11. with the holy Ghost and fire, where∣as hitherto they were baptised vnto repentance with pa∣tience. Here therefore stand the Boemians, which had gotten the victorie ouer the beast, the ciuell estate which beareth vp the whore of Babylon, and of his image, the Ecclesiasticall policie; and his marke of superstitious ceremonies; and of the num∣ber of his name, his armies which he sent against them. These I say stand constantly, at the glassie sea, mingled with fire, continuing sincere and zealous professors; being so farre from being ouercome; that contrarily they haue the harpes of God to sing praises vnto their God for their deliue∣rance from Antichrist. And they being deliuered from the kingdome of Anti∣christ, which spiritually is called Egypt,cap. 15.3. sing the like song, as was that of Moses the seruant of God, when he was past the red sea. And they sing also the song in praise of the Lambe, Iesus Christ; who had deliuered them from the beast of vn∣satiable rapine, &c. The argument of the song was in effect, Great and mer∣ueilous are thy workes,cap. 15.4. Lord God almightie, iust and true are thy waies, king of sainctes. Who shall not feare thee, O Lorde (and not men) and glorifie thy name, with the contempt of men? For thou onely, art holy, and the worlde by the kingdome of Antichrist is filthie, and corrupted. And also, how euer yet Antichrist doe lift vp himselfe, and doe fight to maintaine his kingdome, yet, all nations shall forsake Antichrist, and come, and worship before him, that is God almightie, by the conuersion of all Princes to the Gospell. For proofe whereof, his iudgements are made manifest to all, that are not wilfully blind, and all godly men doe see, what in the end shall come to passe. cap. 15.5. cap. 11.19.After this zeale is found in the people of God, the temple
of God, euen the temple of the tabernacle of the testimonie, was o∣pened in heauen. For as yet, theMat. 21.12. Act. 3.1. temple called the porch, or vtter court is for the most part troden vnder foote by the Gen∣tiles. The tabernacle of the testimonie being opened,cap. 11.19. there was seene in the temple, the arke of the couenant of grace, the do∣ctrine of iustification, beeing clearely taught; other points beeing yet in question among many of the Saints. And hereupon arise great emotions of lightening, and voi∣ces, and thunders, and earthquakes, and much haile, by excom∣munications, and alterations, &c. The complement.

Him Diatharius the Arch∣bishop of Mogunce withstood, for the exactions which hee robbed the countrie by, vnder pretext of warre against the Turkes. Wherefore the thundring Pope depriued him. The causes of his depriuation were these. 1. He would not con∣sent to the exaction of a tenth, twentith, thirtith. 2. He would not be sworne to the Pope, not to conuent the Princes Ele∣ctors,
for the affaires of the empire, without the Popes leaue. 3. He suffered not the Popes Legates at their pleasure to conuent the Clergie. The Pope excommunicated him, who writeth to the Princes of Germanie against the Pope, to dis∣charge Germanie of these exactions, & to appeale to a Coun∣cel. Some of the Princes ioyne with him, and write sharpely to the Pope; requiring the release of these exactions, (for shee is fallen, because her marchants were rich) and complaining of the grieuance offered to the Archbishop, (shee is fallen for making all nations drinke of the wine of the wrath of her fornica∣tion.)Par.

Of the seuen last plagues, by which the wrath of God is fulfilled, vpon the inhabitants of the earth. SO mightily hath the power of God appeared, as that he hath kept the temple open, and continued the preaching of the Gospell; not∣withstanding all oppositions of enemies. And now that his iudgements might be made manifest according to the word of God, he sendeth out his plagues, to the2. Thes. 2. consuming of the man of sinne, in this third woe.

Concerning the preparation, it is said, that the persons who are prouided to execute them, are6. the seuen Angels; the instruments of these punishments, being mightie, more then humane. The place whence they came, is out of the temple,Psal. 76.23.8.9. whence the Lord doth send his blessings, and plagues.

King 8.10.11. temple which Salomon built, when it was filled full of smoke of the glory of God, and of his power; which there was in Sacrament and Type, but here is in deede, and truth.

To this purpose, while Caesar tyrannised abroad, the Pope by all possible meanes, euen by the sale of all things, and leauing Rome &c, a very slaughter-house for his sonnes robbers, night and day; sought to sup∣plie
the wants of his sonne. In this Popes time were pow∣red out also the second, and third Phials. The second Phiall. Vnto the plague of sores, is added the second plague of ef∣fusion of bloud, by sea, which is contained in the second Phial, when it is said,cap. 16.3. And the second Angell powred out his Phiall, vpon the sea, and it became as the bloud of a dead man, and eue∣ry liuing thing died in the sea. That is, such a curse of God fell vpon the sea, that there were horrible slaughters made. For partly the discouerers at sea, doe bring a plague vpon it, by committing many bloudie cruelties; and no blessing thi∣ther, how euer they pretend the blessing of the spreading of the Gospell, which by their crueltie is detested. And partly many battels are now fought at sea, while one Prince war∣reth vpon another, to the great losse of both sides, and death of all sorts. The third Phiall. Yet is not the hand of the Lord shortned, but is stretched out still. For the Lord encreaseth the two former plagues with a third; which is, much effusion of bloud at land, so that the riuers and fountaines are dyed with the bloud of the slaine. Wherefore it is said,cap. 16.4. And the third Angell pow∣red out his Phiall vpon the riuers and fountaines of waters, and they became bloud. Hereupon are sung praises to the Lord, by the Angell, euen him, whose ministrie was iust and holy; by the water, to bring vengeance on the wicked, which as it were, doth say,cap. 16.5.

TO AS MANY AS CALL THEMSELVES CA∣THOLIKES, AND FOLLOW THE Church of Rome, and yet doe desire to know and embrace the truth. WE see and lament, that the multitude of those which doe beare the name of Christians is distracted into many different and contrary opinions; ye is there none of the factions, which pretendeth not that he hath the onely right way. Against this multiplicity, ariseth the word of God, which doth constantly affirme thatEphes. 4 4.5.6. there is but one God, one faith, &c. So that though1. Cor. 9.24. many runne at the price, yet but one obtaineth it. The great Question is among vs all, which side hath the true God, and true faith, and who shall get the price. In this contention none are so feruent as they who call themselues Catholikes, and follow the Church of Rome: and they who are called Protestants, and haue departed from the Church of Rome. In so great opposition, it is certaine both parties are not right. Wherefore you that follow Rome, yet loue the truth, consider with me a little, how we may be sa∣tisfied, which of vs is out of the way, and thinke no scorne to turne into the right path when we haue found it. As for the rest, whom Antichrist hath deluded to stoppe their eares, like deafe Adders against good counsaile, and to open their mouthes to blasphemie, so that they crie all is but lyes, be∣fore they heare, or reade a letter: as God hath prouided no sacrifice for their wilfull sinne; so I leaue them to him that Cor. 5.13. iudgeth them that are without.
It is confessed of vs all, that our Lord and Sauiour Iesus Christ, had the truth, and that he sent his Apostles abroad to preach the same; which they did in their sermone, and deli∣uered in their writings. Now it remaineth to be required, whether the Doctrine by them taught, and recorded in the scriptures be the onely, eternal, and immutable truth or no? Or that the Church may in time deuise more to bee added thereto, other differing from it, or some contrary vnto it, of like authoritie and reuerence? As for the Protestants they bind themselues to the written Word, as a sufficient Canon to walke by, acknowledging it to beReuel. 19.16. the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords. The Church of Rome will not be so straighted, nor so subiect; but wil assume she goeth right, when she wal∣keth by her Traditions, which change with the times; as appeareth by their seueral and opposite decrees and institu∣tions. So that she thinketh her selfe neuer out, whatsoeuer she doth in abolishing the former, and in deuising and in∣ioyning such new articles, as the godly in the primitiue Church neuer knew, nor their fathers before them; vnto which also she holdeth all men are to be subiect on paine of damnation. For the decision of this great question: because it is obiected to the parties themselues that they doe not pursue their arguments with that patience as is required at the hands of Christians: let vs commit the moderation to such, as we all agree, were both truly Christians, (which was theAct. first name, that the Disciples were called by) and truelie Catholikes, which was the next title they tooke; Namely Athanasius and his fellowes: who though they spake in a∣nother case, yet it appeareth by the waight of their argu∣ments, they would speake of our Question, were they at our Conference, in the same sort, as they did at Ari. Let vs see to which of our parties their censure were most pro∣per, if the names of the persons which they speake of, were changed into the persons of our Question. Their speech is recorded by Socrat. lib. 2. cap. 29. When Vrsacius and Valent had read a confession of the
faith, dissenting from the Nic Creede (as the Papists doe from the faith and doctrine of the word of God) published in the raigne of Constantius, Flauius and Eusebius being Consuls (as that of the Papists, is instituted by diuers Popes) the Catholikes that disliked it rose vp and said (as we also say to the Papists:) We came not together with you, because we were destitute of faith (for wee keepe that wholy which wee receiued from the beginning) but that if any did attempt any new thing of that matter, we might resist him. AThanasius (who especially disliked this innouation) wrote vnto his friends almost in these words, which, with changing but the names of the persons whom hee nameth, and are put in the margent, to the Papists, will be thus. What I pray you was wanting in the Catholike Church vnto the doctrine of godlines, that now they should en∣quire of the faith and should by name prefix theConsuls. Popes and Councels (Which were in this present time) before the words which (forsooth) they haue set downe of the faith? For theVrsatius, Va∣lens, Germa∣nius. Popish writers haue done that which was neuer done nor heard among christians. For where they wrote the things, which they thought were to be beleeued, they haue writtenConsuls. the Popes, Councels and places, moneth, and lastly the day, that it might be manifest to all wise men, that their faith had no beginning, before the beginning of the raigne ofConstantius. such Popes and Councels; yea that which is more, all of them hauing regard vnto their owne heresie, haue commit∣ted their owne sentences to writing. Moreouer when they pretend to write of the doctrine of the Lord, they haue named another for their Lord, namelyConstantius. the Pope: For he hath opened vnto them a window vnto all their impiety. And when as they did denie the word of the Sonne of God, to be eternall (for so farre were these enemies of Christ cast into wickednesse) they haue named theEmperor. decrees of the Popes to be eternall. But perchance they catch an occasion
to name theConsuls. Popes and Councels, by the example of the ho∣ly Prophets, who do set downe the time in which they liued. But if they shall dare to affirme so, they shall exceedingly bewray their folly. For albeit there be mention of the times in the prophecies of holy men, as in Esaiah and Hosea, which were in the daies of Ozias and Ioatham, & Achaz and Eze∣chias: as in the prophecie of Ieremie, who liued in the dayes of Iesias: as in the prophecies of Ezechiel and Daniel, who flourished when Cyrus and Darius did raigne, and lastly as in other Prophets which prophecied in other times: yet doe none of them lay any first foundation of pietie and holy re∣ligion. For it was before their times, and alwaies, and before the framing of the world which God by Christ hath pre∣pared for vs. And as for the times in which their faith be∣gan they did not designe (for before those times, them∣selues were faithfull) but those were the times of the pro∣mise pronounced by them. And the promise doth especi∣ally concerne the incarnation of our Sauiour. That which was annexed thereunto did clearely demonstrate those things which should befall the Iewes and Gentiles. But in the times so noted the doctrine of faith (as I said before) had not his beginning, but the Prophets shewed in what times they liued, when they prophecied these things. But these our wise men, when they doe not write things done, nor forshew things to come, but doe write our faith was set forth; presently they annexe theConsuls. Pope, Councel, moneth and day. As godly men doe set downe the times of things done, as also of their ministerie; so those doe note the time in which their doctrine and faith began and was first insti∣tuted. And I would indeede they had committed to wri∣ting their owne only faith; but now they make the begin∣ning of the doctrine of faith; and as though it had not been before, they attempt to dispute thereof. For they do not thus write. So wee do beleeue, but in this sort, The catholicke faith was set forth. Therefore the audacious attempt of this their institution, doth manifestly conuict their grosse folly; and the new instituted manner of their forme so described, doth euery way equall the heresie of the Arian. For so
haue they taught by their writings. Then began they to beleeue so, and from thence they determine to shew their faith. Not otherwise then it is in Saint Luke the Euangelist: There came forth an edicte of taxing.Luk 1. This edict indeede was not before, but from those daies it began, and was set forth by them that did write it. So when these did write thus: Now is the faith set forth, they do shew that their error was now lately deuised, and that before it was not extant. But if they shall adde the word Catholike (as the Arians did, and Papists do) they rush vnaduisedly into the wicked peruerse∣nes of the Cataphrygians, that according to their manner they also say, the christian faith is reuealed to vs, and it began of vs. And as those their Maximilla and Montanus, so they, for Christ, doe callConstantius. the Pope Lord. Now if in their times, and theseConsuls. Popes the faith had his beginning, what shall be∣come of the Fathers and blessed Martyrs, what of these whom themselues haue instructed and were dead before theseConsuls. Popes? By what meanes will they raise them from the dead, that they may altogether roote out of their minds the things which they taught them, and engraffe into them the things which now they haue deuised and written? So absurd and senseles they bee, that they haue onely skill to forge counterfeit matters, which as they are foolish and vn∣proper; so may they bee reprooued and refuted very easily. Thus much Athanasius would say to them as hee said to the Arians. To the indifferent Reader. THou seest (gentle Reader) that by the weight of Athanasius Arguments, the Papists are excluded from the number of true Christians and Catholikes, as well as the Arians, so farre forth as they obtrude any doctrine which was not from the begin∣ning, but hath been deuised at seuerall times. Of this sort are the points in which we differ from them. It remaineth therefore that thou conclude, that either Athanasius and his fellowes, or the Pope with his followers are to be auoyded. The Lord blesse thy hunger and thirst after righteousnesse. FINIS.
