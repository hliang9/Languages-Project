Sperando spiro. Operando despero. S. S. ¶ Imprented at London, for Wil∣liam Ponsonby. 1583.
To the Church of God, in Walsingham, beloued in Christe, and called to be Saints: grace, mercy, and the hope of saluation, from God the Father, thorough Christ Iesus his Sonne, be multiplyed vnto you. AS your place hath beene be∣fore (my brethren) famous▪ or rather for Idolatry infa∣mous: non tam nobilis, quàm nota, not so noble as notori∣ous: so woulde I nowe, (if I were able) perswade you, to redeeme, and purchase a new the losse of that long time so euilly spent: with the gain of greater knowledge, and more conscionable practise, in old and young of that glorious Gospell, which now thorough Gods mercies hath driuen away ignoraunce, en∣lightened your heartes, beegotten you to GOD, taught you his feare, and whereof you haue no far∣der hold, then at the Mat. 21. 33. will of the Lord. If Ephesus must redeeme the time spente in the honour of Diana, and Acts. 19. 28. dishonour of God, which walking now in the Ephe. 5. 17. knowledge of his will: what price thinke you of repentaunce must VValsingham lay downe, to recouer the losse of those daies, in the worship of an Idoll▪ and neglect of Gods ser∣uice? If Adam be Gene. 3. 17▪ curssed, for pleasing his owne fancie, and displeasing God: how sharpe a cursse thinke you, deserued that serpent, that first Gene. 3. 4. enti∣ced him herunto? If Israel did smart for Idolatrie, by whoring at 1. King. 12. Bethel: shall Heroboam goe free, that moued them to sinne? If the dayes of Iosiah must 2. King. 23. mourne, for the time of his Fathers: what
teares must Manasses shed that caused them to erre? And if all places in this land had neede to lament the filthie Idolatries of the former ages: how much more oughtest thou (VValsingham) bewaile, that hast reached foorth that Cup of poyson to infect them with all? The brasen Serpent was (. King. 18. 4.) pouldred to dust, as the instrument of the peoples fall: feare least God in iudgement make thee as dust, whiche hast caused many to slumber in their sinnes. The Temple, and house of that Idoll Baal was (. King. 10. 27) broken downe, and the Lord in his hoate displeasure made thereof a place of vile vse: thou hast been the seat and throne of many Balimes. Feare thou, and re∣pent: least the Lord in his firie wrath, make of thy proude shrine of Satan, a poore and miserable cot∣tage. Thou hast shaken the state, and enchaunted the mindes of kings, and princes, with the banefull dregges of mens inuentions: Nowe nourishe the soules of thy children that are in thee, with that (Pet. 2. 2.) sincere milke of Gods holy worde: thou hast been the puddle to defile thousandes, now become that same Bethesda (hn. 5. 2.) to heale thy selfe: thou hast beene to Englande as the waters of (od. 15. 23.) Marah to Israel, now sweeten thy selfe with the tree of life: thou hast been to all inhabitants as the vnfruitfull wa∣ter of (Kings. 2. 19.) Hiericho, now become seasoned with the salt of grace: thou hast by thy former filthinesse, drawne many to Hel: repent thee of that, and now let thy (atth. 5. 16.) light shine foorth, to call many to God. To conclude, thou hast been the very (ue. 16. 2.) foule cage of all hatefull and vglie birdes: now pray and la∣bour that thou maiest become the happie hauen, & safe harborough of all godlinesse, and integritie of life. Amen. Thine to doe thee good. S. S. Sperando spiro. Operando despero.

In that Christ teacheth vs to pray that Gods will may be done, in earth as it is in heauen: what doth he séeme to forbid? A. In teaching vs so to pray, hee woulde not haue vs to séeke our owne wils, or to sticke to our owne wisedom. Q. Then it foloweth yt we pray against pride, couetousnes, extortion, vsury, bri∣bery, excesse, dronkennes, whoredome, theft, lying & such like vices, for these be the will of man, & contrarie to the will
of God. A. VVe doe so I confesse. Q. If we pray against those sinners, and to be endewed with righteousnesse, and yet take a delight in them: what doe we? A. Euen mocke with God, and so doe heape punishment vpon our selues for it. Q. Because I sée this to be against mee, should I not therefore pray? A. If we should not pray, we were the despisers of his commandement. Mark. 14. 38. Q. VVhat are we here taught to aske? giue vs this day our daily bread. A. All thinges necessarie to this present life. Q. Why doth he teach vs to pray day∣ly for dayly bread? A. Because without his dayly blessing our food could giue small nourishment vnto vs. Q. What desire ye in this petition: For∣giue vs our trespasses. A. Here I desire his mercy: for vnlesse he be pitifull vnto vs, we are readie to
fall into vtter destruction. Q. What meaneth the condition? As we forgiue them that trespasse against vs. A. Here we desire, that it may bee his pleasure to giue vs grace that we may be ready to pardon those that haue of∣fended vs. Q. Why doe you say? Leade vs not into temptation? A. Here we pray that God will not suf∣fer vs to be ouercome of temptation: but that being for our profit or tryall, we might boldly bee strengthened in him to abide that which his pleasure is to lay vpon vs. Q. Why is this added? For thine is the kingdome, the power and the glory for euer. A. This doth teach vs to confesse that all rule and authoritie doth come from God, and ruleth all thinges according to his will. A. VVhy sayest thou, Amen, in the lat∣ter end of the prayer? A. By that word I desire the Lord God to grannt all thinges which before I
prayed for. Q. Tell me the effect in few wordes of all that thou hast saide vpon the Lordes Prayer? A. I desire Gods grace to doe his will, and thinges necessarie both to body and soule. A Prayer. THe Lord giue vs grace to lay these thinges vp déepely in our harts, and alwaies to be mindfull of them, as it be∣hooueth his true and faithfull Children in Christ Iesus. So be it. FINIS.
