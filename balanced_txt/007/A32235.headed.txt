A FOUNTAIN OF Loyal Tears, POURED FORTH BY A Sorrowful SON, for the Ʋntimely Death of His Royal FATHER. Being a Form of Prayer to be Used by all those that yet Retain a spark of Religion to God, or Loyalty to their Prince. Recommended by King Charles the II, to be used by all His faithful Subjects throughout. His Dominions, in these times of War, Sickness, Famine, Trouble, and Adversity. PARIS: Printed by His MAJESTIES special Command. 1649.
FOrasmuch as it hath been the late Re∣solves of those that call themselves The Commons Assembled in Parliament, to forbid Preaching and Praying in that Ʋ∣niform-way formerly agreed upon and en∣joyned by Our royal Father, and Free Par∣liaments: Therefore We have thought good to Commend unto all Our Loving Subjects a short and easie Method of Prayer, that by joyntly seeking unto God, he may (as from the Ninivites) turn away his fierce wrath from Ʋs miserable Creatures, that so We may receive forgiveness of al Our manifold witkedness wherewith We have justly pro∣voked his vengeance to destroy Ʋs: There∣fore as We have humbled Our Self before him by Fasting and Prayer, so We desire all Our Loving Subjects to do the like; that We being delivered from the destructi∣on of Our Enemies, may again be restored and brought to all good temprature of Go∣vernment, Love, Ʋnity, Charity, and all other Blessings; Which is the Only desire of Your Afflicted Soveraign Charles Rex. From our Court in Jersy Septemb. 14. 1649.
A Form of PRAYER. A Prayer for all oppressed People. ALmighty and everlasting God, We acknowledge and confess from the bottom of our hearts, That we are justly plagued for our manifold sins and infirmities: We beseech thee, for the merits of thy Son, to looke upon our manifold Miseries with the eye of thy Mercy; and of thine infinit goodness vouchsafe to limit out some portion of our Deliverance unto us, as may seem most conducing to the Glory of thee, and thy Son Jesus Christ: let not the children of iniquity, O Lord, any longer triumph over us; let our
thee let the bloud of Christ shed in his members appease thy justly incensed an∣ger against us for our sins: O Lord, be∣hold how they have not only destroyed their King, who was the lively Image of thy Sacred Majesty on Earth, but yet rest so unreasonable, and unsatisfied, that they content not themselves with the destruction of him and his loyal Sub∣jects, but seek the destruction of his whole Posterity: their tongues O Lord are far sharper then their Swords: they delight in nothing more, then to slan∣der the footsteps of thine Anointed: in the place where they should proclaim Peace and Salvation, they have Trum∣peted forth Rebellion, Schisme, and War, and the way of Peace they have not known: as the blind Jews, they have denyed the holy One, and the Just; and desired a Murderer and a Rober to be granted unto them; holding it liberty to be led Captive by their own sin; ra∣ther chusing to live in perpetual bon∣dage under the Iron-yoak of a wicked, perverse, and ungodly generation of men, then under the peaceable Govern∣ment of a most gracious King: forgive
we beseech thee the crying sins of this Nation, the chief of which are Perjury, Murder, Sacriledge, and contempt of thy holy Word and Commandements; O Lord, we acknowledge there is an ac∣count due for every idle word at thy Tribunal, then how much more for the breach of so many Oaths, Covenants, and Solemn Declarations pronounced with lifted up hands before thee? thou haste, O God, commanded us to fear thee, and honor thy Vicegerent; but we quite contrary, have despised thee; and dishonor'd, nay Murdered him thou commandest us to honor: Thou com∣mandest us to love one another, even as thy Son loved us: but instead of loving, we have hated, nay killed and robbed one another: thou commandest us to eate the sweat of our own brows, but we are contented with nothing more then to eat the sweat of others; nay make it our work, and sweat in defraud∣ing our Neighbors; we have neglected those things that were necessary for our eternal Salvation, and cleaved to the Momentary things of this World; we have not frequented thy house, and now
a Rebellious House of Robbers and Theeves prey upon us: we were be∣come a stiff-necked and rebellious Na∣tion; and now thou hast put an iron yoak about our necks, and made us slaves to slaves themselves, the meanest (and most contemptible) of the People; whose Designs are Treasonable, whose Religion is Hypocrisie, whose Practice is Bloudy, whose Power is Usurpation, whose Ambition is Power; who by ir∣religious Policy seek alwayes to prevent us from returning to our former Allegi∣ance to our lawful King, as thou hast commanded; Lord make them all as Athaliah, or as Rebellious Absalom, and deliver us thy people, that put our only trust in thee; raise up we beseech thee a Moses to thy People, and a Jehojadah to their King, that we being delivered from these Usurpers, may serve thee with fear and reverence all our dayes, Amen.
A Prayer in the time of Danger. O Lord ever merciful and pittiful to those that truly repent, and cry unto thee in their Afflictions, though our sins are many and grievous, that we may still rather expect thy further an∣ger, then any Deliverance to free us thy poor Servants from so many heavy Plagues and Burdens that are laid upon us by our fellow Subjects, who now U∣surpe Rule, and Tyrannize over us; O Lord, since thy Mercies are over all thy Works, and that thou never failest to Relieve all those who with humble hearts, and unfained Affections come unto thee by Repentance: We beseech thee for the Merits of thy only Son that suffered death for us, to protect us from the malice of all our cruel Enemies; since they have taken our Means, Lord, let not our Lives be the objects of their hatred; Call in we beseech thee the Heir of our Vineyard, that we may weed out those Brambls that with their sharp
fruitless thornes catch us as in a trap, and by their tyranny and injustice hold us till they have destroyed us: We be∣seech, thee since they will not frame their Will to thy Word, according to thy Word, let them perish: let them be as Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, sawllow∣ed up by the Earth or meanest of the People, although they have exalted themselves to heaven by their Prosperi∣ty in wickedness, (accounting their suc∣cess therein thy Work) yet make them know, that they have been but all this time digging their own graves, and ear∣ning the wages of death, nay double damnation: Lord we beseech thee pull off this Mask of Religion from the face of Rebellion, that thy people may be no longer deceived, but plainly see their Hypocrisie, and Restore unto us Justice, Piety, and Truth, that so we may again be made capable of Peace, Prosperity, and all other Blessings: O deliver thy Servants from the poyson under their tongues, from the snares of their lipps, and from the fire and swords of their words, that under Colour of long-Pray∣ers have not only sought to devour the
Houses of their Brethren, but of their King and their God, wresting thy holy Word to their own distruction, have heaped unto themselves false Teachers of the Calves of Jeroboam to serve them∣selves in their wickedness, and Prophe∣sie Lies till they devour the Churches Patrimony, and the Kings Life that was her Nursing Father, and the Peoples O∣bedience, that were her dear Children; their eyes swell with fatness, & as their Lust moves them, even so they do; ac∣counting it the dictates of thy holy Spi∣rit, when it is the powerful working of Sathan in the Children of disobedience: by the craft of their tongues they cor∣rupt Divers, so that many people fall unto them, out of whom they suck no small advantage, they have no misfor∣tune happens unto them, neither are they chastized as others, but puffed up with Pride, and overwhelmed with Cru∣elty, they prosper in the world, have the Houses of God and the King in pos∣session, they lay snares privily to take the upright in heart, that they may shed his innocent bloud, and devour him; they have prepar'd instruments of death
(Hooks, Pullyes, and the like) to per∣secute the Anointed of the Lord, and tread down his Life and Honour in the dust: Stand up O Lord in thy wrath, lift thy self up because of the indignati∣on of our enemies; when thou makest Inquisition for Blood remember them; and forget not the Complaint of the poor: let the Wicked be trapped in the work of their own hands, and sink down into the Pitt they have digged for o∣thers, and caught in their own Net; let them be turned backward into Hell, and all perish that forget God, and set at naught his Commandements; their mouths are full of Fraud, Deceit, and Cursing; they are become so proud that they care not for God, neither is the Almighty in any of their thoughts, their wayes are grievous to thy People (be∣cause they discern not thy Judgements) they defie the men that are more righ∣teous then themselves, they lurk privily in the theevish Corners of the streets, and in their Dens to murder the inno∣cent: their eyes are set against the poor, they dissemble, fall down and humble themselves, that the Congregations of
the poor may fal into the hands of their Captains: they flatter with their lips, and dissemble with their double hearts; they have said, With our Tongue wee will prevaile, we are they that ought to speak, who is lord over us? their throat is an open Sepulchre, the poyson of Asps is under their lips, and their tongues are tipt with deceit, their speeches are of Cursing and bitternrss, their feet are swift to shed Blood, destruction is in their wayes, and the way of Peace have they not known: they work mischief every day, and eat up the people as it were bread: they swear unto their Neighbors, and dis-appoint them, and their Judges take a Reward to destroy the Righteous: Arise O Lord and save thy People that are in great adversity and tribulation: who is God but the Lord? who hath any strength except our God: It is he that will Guide our King with strength of War, and make his way perfect: He shal teach his hands to fight, and make his armes to break a bow of Steel: He shall cause him to follow his Enemies and overtake them, and shall not return till they are de∣stroyed:
the Lord will deliver him from his Cruel Enemies, and set him up a∣bove his adversaries, even from the stri∣vings of the people shall he deliver him and make him the head of the Heathen, a strange People shall serve him: then shall the English Rejoyce and give thanks to thee O Lord, and sing praises unto thy Name that hast heard their Prayers, and (after much Chastize∣ments) hast shewed they loving kind∣ness unto thine Anointed, and to his Seed for ever. Save us O Lord, and hear us, O King of Heaven, when we call upon thee. Amen. A Prayer for the King. ALmighty and most merciful Fa∣ther, We humbly beg and be∣seech thee (for Jesus Christ his sake) to showr down thy Blessings abundant∣ly on the head of thy Servant and our Dread Soveraign Lord King Charles: We beseech thee give us Obedient and
Loyal hearts to Him, as He unto thy Commandements; increase in His Loy∣al Heart true Faith, godly Zeal, and love of the same; that He may alwayes incline to thy Will, and walk in thy wayes: give Him power and strength, that He may re-gain His Rights, van∣quish and overcome all His Enemies, and after a long and prosperous Reign, attain everlasting Joy and Felicity, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen. A Prayer for the Queen, and the rest of the Royal Branches. O Almighty God, the Fountain of all goodness; We beseech thee to bless our Gracious Queen Mary, and all Her Royal Off-spring: give Them a full measure of Joy after all their Sor∣row, and evermore mightily Defend Them: endue them with thy holy Spi∣rit, enrich Them with thy Heavenly Grace, prosper Them with all Happi∣ness, and bring Them to thine everlast∣ing Kingdom, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
A Prayer to be said this time of War. O Almighty God, King of all kings, and Governor of all things, whose power no Creature is able to resist; to whom it belongs justly to punish rebel∣lious Sinners, and to be merciful to all those that be Obedient, and truely re∣pent: Save and deliver us (we beseech thee) from the hands of our Cruel and Bloody Enemies; abate their Pride, as∣swage their Malice, and confound all their Plots and Devices; that thy Ser∣vants being armed with thy Defence, may be evermore preserved from all perils and dangers to glorifie thee that art the only giver of all Victory, through the Merits of thy only Son Je∣sus Christ our Lord. Amen. FINIS.
