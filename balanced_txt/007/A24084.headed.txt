AN EPHEMERIS FOR The Year 1654. Being the second after Leap-year. Together with a Iudgment, 1. On the great Eclipse of the SUN, August 2. 2. On the Opposition of Saturn and Iupiter. 3. On the quarterly Ingresses of the Sun into the Equinoctial and Solsti∣tial Points. 4. Monthly Observations. By NICH CULPEPER, Gent. Student in Astrology and Physick. MATTH. 16. vers. 2, 3. When it is evening ye say, It will be fair wea∣ther, for the Skie is red; and in the morning It will be foul weather to day, for the Skie is red and lowring. O ye Hypocrites, ye can dis∣cern the face of the Skie, but can ye not discern the Signs of the Times? London, Printed by Iohn Macock for the Company of STATIONERS. 1654.
I Have three things of consequence to treat of this Year, and scarce two sheets of paper allowed me to write my Judgement in; therefore upon that account let me be  if I give not  Rea∣sons for al I write, as my usual custom is; and the truth is, I see neither reason nor experience will satisfie un∣reasonable men. The things I shall treat of, are these: 1. The Opposition of Saturn and Iupiter. 2. The Eclipse of the Sun. 3. The general Judgment of the Year. Of all these in order, and in the same order they were layd down. This being the last and greatest ☍ of ♄ and ♃ I in∣tended at first to write of, and of none of the precedent: I call it the last, because there will not be another al∣most this thir∣ty years, the next ☌ inter∣vening: I call it the greatest, because they are both
with great and eminent fixed Stars of the first magni∣tude, viz. Saturn with the Basilisk, or Lions heart, Iupiter with Fomahand, and therefore this requires the more diligent speculation, and the more exact dis∣quisition; and therefore before I begin, it is not amiss to see if it may be parallel'd in by-gone Ages; and this is very difficult, if not impossible, to be done, by one who hath so little time to read Histories as I have: that which comes nearest to it in resemblance, happened anno 1434. at which time Saturn and Iupiter made an Opposition from the latter ends of Leo and Aquary, about which time appeared a most terrible Comet, and so there may do now for ought that I know; nay I verily beleeve, there will sometimes this year appear such a Comet as will amaze the beholders. Kind Coun∣trymen, let this be one Article of your Faith, That the Eternal God of Heaven and Earth shews nothing in vain: When God shews Wonders in the Heavens a∣bove, and Signs in the Earth beneath, then is the time approaching when he will pour out his Spirit upon flesh, when he will bring his people out of Babylon, or Confusion, which you will, and make Ierusalem the glory of all the world. But to proceed: In the same year 1434. the Venetians and Floren∣tines made War against his Holiness the Pope, and might have done glorious things had their principles been good, for away run his Holiness, as fast as a Hare before a kennel of Hounds, and was glad at heart (I'le warrant him) he could scape so: A general Council was held at Bazil, as there is at Ratisbone, at the wri∣ting hereof, where the Pope permitted the Bohemians to receive their Sacrament in both kinds, whereas both
before and since the Priests drink up all the wine them∣selves, and leave the people almost choake with their breaden God: But here came all the mischief, after∣wards these Princes, when they had  the Pope out of S. Peters Chair, like a company of mad Dogs, or Bedlam men, fell out, and went together by the ears one with another. The truth is, I cannot stand relating Histories: An ☍ of ♄ and ♃ seldom happens but it signifies Kings and Magistrates shall be deposed, expe∣cially such whose Kingdoms are under the Signs which the opposing Planets are in; neither did I ever read of such a memorable ☍ of ♄ and ♃ as this is; it is worth the noting, that such an ☍ should succeed such a strange and not to be parall l'd ☌ as the last was, accompanied with such a formidable Eclipse of the Sun, as this will, in the same sign, and near the same degree where Saturn is at the ☍. The Pope begins generally to be hated throughout the world, and 'tis but time; the fall of Rome approach∣eth, but not this year: I could almost afford to be afraid of a dearth of Corn and Cattel, by reason of the ex∣ceeding intemperance of the year, one way or another, as Ovid saith; Et modo Sol nimius, nimius  corripit imbor, Sidera nunc ventique nocent, avidaque volueres Sina jacta laedunt,  fatigant , & inexpugnabile . Now too much drought annoys, now lodging showres Stars smitch, Winds blast, the greedy Fowl devours The new sown grain, Rintare and Darnel tire The fetter'd Wheat, and Quitch that through it spi.
It were well if our Parliament would take some course that there might not be so much Corn spent in waste, it being easie to be proved that there is more Corn drunk down in strong Liquor in one day in Lon∣don, then would suffice the poor a week, perhaps a fort∣night; all which lies in the power of our State to a∣mend, by making an Act, That Brewers should not brew their bear so strong: neither hath any County to my knowledg yet so much as petitioned them about such a business, so tender (over the left shoulder) an rich men toward the good of the poor: Let me intreat the present Parliament to Eternalize their Names to posterity in performing so good, so righteous a work, that it may be said of them hereafter, they have done something toward the good of this Nation; in so do∣ing the poor would not want bread, neither could that beastly sin of Drunkenness rage in this Nation as now it doth: and let me tell them this, and I will tell them but the truth, It would be a work more acceptable in the sight of God, then seven years fasting and praying: I would to God they would read at their leasures Isa 58. 6, 7, 8. Is not this the Fast that I have chosen?  loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the , to let the oppressed go free; and that ye  every yoke? Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to  house? When thou seest the naked, that thou  him, and that thou hide not thy self from thine ? Then shall thy light break  as the , and thine health shall spring sorth speedily,  thy right  shall go before thee, the glory of  Lord shall be thy rereward.
for this present ☍ it happens in  eighth House of the ♂, if the received sigure of the ♂ by the Rudol∣phin Tables be true; and therefore it  to , and those no mean ones neither; let time tell you who they be, that will speak  when I may . But that we may be a little clear in this, let us see what  of the world are under Leo and Aquary, Taurus and Scorpio, for in all probability the ☍ will bite hardest upon them. Under ♉ aro, Russia, Polonia the great, Ireland, Lorrain, , Helvetia, Rhetia, Franconia, Parthia, Porfia, the Islands of Cyclades, Cyprus, and the Sea. Towns of Asia the less. Of Cities and Towns, Bononia, Sena, Mantua, Tarentum, Sicila, Parma, Brixia, Tigure,  Nantz, Lipsig, Posnania &c. Under ♌ , Gallia, Togata, the Alps, Italy, Sicity, Apulia, Bohemia, a part of Turkey, Phaenicia, Caldaea: Of Cities and Towns,  Syracusa, Rome, Ra∣venna, Cremona, , , Prauge, Lintz, Cremisum. Under ♏ , Norway the higher, Bavaria, Comage∣na, Capadocia, , Mauritania, the Kingdom of Fesse, Gethulia, : Of Cities and Towns, Algires. Valence in Spain, Trapezant, Vrbinum, A∣quilia, Pistorium, , Forum, , Messa∣na, Vienna in France, , Francford upon Odar. Under ♒ is, Amazania, , great Tartaria, Valachia, Moscovia, the South part of Swediand, West∣phalia, Mosel, Piemont, part of Bavaria, Aethiopia, Sogdiana, Media, Arabia the Desart: Of Cities,
Hamborough, Breme, Monsterrat, Pisaurum, Trent, Ingolstate. These, and as many more as God pleases, are like to suffer in the effects of this ☍; I could al∣most afford also to be afraid of France, because it hath always suffered upon such like Oppositions as these. But to proceed; It threatens War and Bloodshed both in the Eastern and Western parts of the world; Let such as traffique to the East and West Indies have a care of themselves, there  danger enough, and let them remember I told them of it; but that which may give England some cause of joy amongst so much sadness, it will go near to send many Oppressors to take a supper apud inferos. Saturn in the Eleventh before the Counsellors of Princes, and makes them prophecy as truly as Zedochia did when he made him horns of Iron, and wonderfully exhausts their estate, so that Princes will know what it is to want money,  well as Plebeians. Besides, another mischief will come in the neck of the former, Princes will be subject to break their Leagues one with ano∣ther, and use pernicious, sly and subtil practises, to the undoing of others first, and themselves afterwards. I would willingly do the Princes of Europe some good, if they were but capable of  it, not to give too much credence to the flattering Proposals of Embassa∣dors. I hope I shall prevail so far with our English State, as to put them in mind of the old Proverb, All is not Gold that glisters; let them remember I told them of it. We find Saturn in this ☍ to be in ♌, which in the Zodiack bears the emblem of Majesty, and near the most royal Star of all the Zodiack, Cor Leo: It would
make a wise man admire what ♄ should do there, he having no more right to the place, then a Plowman or a Coleheaver hath to a Crown. When Naples made  Allianello, a Fisherman, their Governor, there was a Commonwealth sweetly governed; and so will Saturn carry himself in the  of this ☍: such  will rise up to rule Kingdoms, as will per∣form their places not with a spirit of righteousness, peace, and just judgment, but with rlgor, power, and impudence; not counting godliness great gain, but gain great godliness; not counting covertousness the greatest evil, but the greatest good. Let us also remem∣ber, that the ♂ of ♄ and ♃ was in the sixth House of this figure, and Mars in the very place of the ♂; whence for all that I know there may Wars ensue it, especially in such places as are under the sign ♓; such are, , Calabria, Portugal, Galitia, Normandy, Garo∣mantes, Lidia, Pamphylia, Egypt the higher:  Ci∣ties and Towns, Alexandira, Hispalis, Compostellae, Worms, Ratisbone. Besides, ♓ being a Sea sign, Pira∣cies will be very frequent: the plain truth is, all Eu∣rope will be together by the ears; and if you look up∣on them and upon Bedlam, you would know no differ∣ence, but only one is bigger then the other, such a mad∣ness possesses their heads. I had almost forgotten poor Iupiter, and yet I should be loth, according to the custom of the world, to leave a man in his extremity: Iupiter is in the fifth House, but makes but ill-favored sport, neither can be merry in the House of pastimes, because opposed by Saturn; I am afraid it  Abortion, or hard labor to women with child, let them labor to prevent it in time.
Mars and Venus in ♂ in the Sixth  many dis∣eases arising from whoredom; indeed I am afraid the  pox will be as  in London this year, as ever it was  London was a City. The Moon is upon the  of the nineth House, which signifies such Religion as the present times ; and in , though with the , and head of , as though the Clergy should be  about this time, or rather horn-mad, and run upon such  designs (as they know how)  should bring all the Nation into trouble , and them∣selves to the Ax or the Rope at last. Our own  record, that Cardinal , when the Pope was dead, wrote to the King  France to make him Pope, and if he would not, he sent him word he would make such a russling amongst Christian Princes, as should make all Europe . Gentle Clergy, be not angry with me, he was a man of your own Coat, and if you follow his steps, you must expect his reward, which what it was you are not ignorant. In this figure the Lady of the Tenth applies to the Lady of the Ascendent, having lately passed the Lord of the Nineth and Twelfth; as who should say, the underhand dealiugs of the Clergy will be made manifest to the people, and they will be willing to be Priest∣ridden no longer, nor pay so much mony for a few words that  nothing: and  all  read this, take notice what I say; this year is like to prove a dark and dismal year to the Clergy. It were worth the knowing, when these times  probably like to have an end, when England may ex∣pect to see better days: This  us see if we
can prove by rules of Art, and so we will conclude this . That the last ☌ of Saturn and Iupiter signified a change of Government throughout the world.  tells you in his Book   Mundi; it signifies, saith he, some new kind of Government to come into the world: Aslo Mr Lilly in that admira∣ble piece of his, his Prophetical Merline, pag. 27, 28. gives you these very words: Let the inhabitants of Europe in general observe, that as this  is in an aquatical sign, so the effects proceeding from thence will be such, and of such like quality and opera∣tion, as sire is to water, or water to sire: sor as water  and abateth the extraordinary hotness of sire in Natural operations; so this Conjunction , that what  is now, or hath been illegally ob∣tained, by any Prince against his Vassals, or by the Nobility and  against their  in the  siery or cōmanding, times (when will and plea∣sure were positive Laws) shall now by the effects de∣pending upon  Conjunction receive a  or abatement of their ,  and oppression, pro∣portionable to the quality of the  or  of former . , Diff. 2. Chap. 1. Cum  in  vel signis ,  vulgi & mediocrum  corum cum regibus in ordine; Viz. When mutation or change of any of these  is either in  or  signs, it  estate of the common or mean man to be equal to that of Princes: An , if judiciously observed, and , not  from .
This is  real truth, and will in due time be  manifest so to be, for the Government must come in∣to the hands of the people after the Lord hath prepared them for it, and then everlasting Peace, and  War is like to be in England: This time  long ago looked for, but it pleased not God that good man should live to see it. Let us see now what time we may conjecture by the Rules of Astrology in sulfilling this so great a matter. That the last Conjunction of Saturn and Iupiter foreshewed it, we told you before; neither is it in the least  to me, but that this and the other Op∣positions will make way for the effecting of it, though not without some difficulty:  when, that  thing LIBERTY, which is that all honest men , when shall we see that, you say? This happily may be in consultation about the latter end of Ianuary,  when Iupiter cuts the place he was in  his last Con∣junction with Saturn. A hopeful time for England may assuredly be expected in March, 1655. when the Sun meets with Iupiter in Aries, but  brought to perfection before the  Trines of Saturn and Iu∣piter. I am curbed for want of paper: The rationality of the whole Art of Astrology, whereby a Reason of such Prognostications as these are may be drawn, I hope will shortly be printed by my special Friend  William Freeman, Practitioner in Physick in Bedford. Of the Eclipse of the Sun. TWo Eclipses of the Moon happen this Year, though but small ones, which want of paper
me to omit, and shall only treat of one great  of the Sun, which I do  natural,  the Priest told his people of the last Eclipse; The E∣clipse, quoth he, is natural, and therefore can have no such ill effects as the Astrologers tell you of. God help his Calves head; Is not meat and drink natural,  yet doth it not nourish? Is not poyson natural, and yet doth it not ? The truth is, all Eclipses work by , as I could prove Philosophically, had I paper; but I must come close home to the business. I shall give you a double Figure of the Eclipse, both of them for the Meridian  London; the one from the Tables of , the other from Vin∣cent Wing's  Caleste; I hold the first to be the . In point of  here is 21 min. dif∣ference; for my own par∣ticular, I ra∣ther assent to the Tables of , then those of our painful coun∣tryman, Vin∣cent Wing. If I should
say it would be a great E∣clipse, I shold srighten the City wives, and therefore I must not absolutely tel the truth, you shall see how big it will be whē it coms: I take not upon me the part of an A∣stronomer, to shew how many digets will be eclipsed, which is very probable will be almost all but of an Astrologer, to  what the  will be; and what they may probably be, I shall give you my Iudg∣ment, as far as the paper will  me, for  intend to  no more of this , neither shall you find me to say one thing, and do another. The Lords of this   and Mars, be∣cause they  both :   of the  Angle, busie in the  House  prayers: If  to the  Astrologers,  will take that Planet  be Lord which  most  at the time, Mercury without all dispute of  story will have the ,  whom   because both  are  between  of Saturn and Mars, I must acknowledg only  two ; and   doth but
the  of other Planets, and carries the signification of that Planet ho was last joyned withall, till he meets with another, which here was Saturn, and therefore he rather increases the , then mitigates it. There is a Regal fixed Star within the rays of this Eclipse, which some call the Lions heart, and o∣thers the Basilisk, a very  fixed Star,  ho∣norable; he knows well how to give great honour, and knows as well how to take it away again; he is of the nature of Iupiter and Mars: You may re∣member I told you before that Eclipses did harm by privation of good, and not by position of evil; if so,  Cor Leo take away honour as well as give , why may not this Eclipse do the like? In the next place let us see where the Sun is eclip∣sed; if you take it vulgarly, it is in the second face of Leo, where it signifies great , and much damage to persons of quality, both Kings and Magi∣strates: But if you take it according to  Asterism, it happens then in the first face of Leo, in which are many fixed Stars of  suffocating  pestilential na∣ture, it there signifies great  of Corn and Grain; indeed a famine is to  feared, the death of some certain famous Prince, or if  not his life, he loseth both  and Treasure. Also consider, that  Sign in which the Eclipse happens is both fixed and violent,  shews both violence and durability of the : As for the  subject to  of , they are the very  which  before  subject to the  of the ☍ of  and Iupiter,
therefore I shall not stand to name them again here; and if you do but cast a serious eye upon the  you may  a mighty harmony between them, which will mightily increase the evil influence of both. To go about to  whether the influence of this Eclipse will be good or bad, is a thing ; for what good can be expected, when the great light which God made to rule the day, is eclip∣sed  the bodies of Saturn and Mars? Be∣sides, it  a question to me whether any Eclipses  good  not. The  it happens in is the tenth House, which is  and  of the Heavens, the  of  rule, and dignity, the highest  and amongst  gives signification of Kings, Prin∣ces, , and indeed such men as these wil  be subject to the influence of this ; for indeed Spica Virginis upon the  Aicendant  promise some good to the common people, or at least  much of the evil  the Eclipse as to them . As for the Lords of the , there is no question to me  Saturn and Mars will bear the . Let us see in the next place what they  and if joyned  be the , the  are rather like to be worse then better  Authors speak of. I shall  only upon the  of Origanus, as wanting paper to write down what other Authors say:  Saturn, saith he, be Lord of the Eclipse, he corrupts the fruits of the Earth,  reason of excessive cold, and  diseases in the bodies of men, Consumptions, and wastings and
pinings away of the whole body, occasioned by some  of Rhume:  I  Saturn in Leo cannot chuse  bring  detriment to the vital spirit, and that may  be the reason why those that have written of Mathematical Physick say that Saturn in Leo, if  be  of  sickness, uni∣versally afflicts the whole body; , so  as here, he drie up , causeth Fluxes, Quartane Agues , , Lamentation, Mourning and , great , especially of aged people;  to  life; death of Cattel,  are for mens use,  those  which  with , and man by  of  when they are killed will be sick also; he  up a  misty corrupt and  Ayr,  of a cold , misty, foggy Winter to come, with dark  Ayr, with abu da ce of Snow, , : neither  he  all his mis∣chief  the , the  bear his share al∣so; there he  up sudden and most  Tem∣pests, manifold Ship , difficult and dangerous , the Sea keeps not his  banks, and great  Rivers  be expected; he  eatens destruction  of  by . or other such like ; he  de∣struction to grass and  by  sloods; he threatens destruction to Corn by blasting, violent  of hail, and furious : Let such as in∣habit those places which  Leo, I told you what they were in the ☍  Saturn and Iupiter, Ita∣ly, Rome and Bohemia are some of them; let them, I
say, take heed lest God visit them with the Sword, Famine and Pestilence all at one time: And let Hol∣land also take heed, for God is making inquisition for the innocent blood they have shed, by beginning a causless War, not only refusing to strike sail upon our Seas, but falling upon us in our own Harbors. But of this more by and by. It is time now we leave Saturn, and speak a word or two of Mars: I must speak something of him, though it be very  I shall speak but little good; generally he causeth corruption by his excess in dryness, and especially when he is in a  sign, as now he is, being in a  teering sign like him∣self, he  up war and , ,  risings in Nations, and that which is the effects of them, imprisonment, banishment, hanging and head∣ing; Kings and Magistrates will be mad, and their Subjects stubborn; Towns and Cities will be be∣sieged, taken, and fired; Great men will be suddenly arraigned, condemned, and beheaded; men will be  to acute , corruption and eruption of blood; violent deaths  threatened,  to young men, both untimely and suddenly; Kings and Magistrates will be much given to , violence, injustice and injury; and if any ask when they were ever any otherwise, let them take notice that , so posited as here, shews a great aggravation and  of their : Men will be exceedingly  to violence, injury, robbing and killing of men, plundering and firing of Towns and houses, Law∣suits and Duels: In the Ayr he stirs up extraordinary heat, sultery hot weather,  and infections
winds, much thunder and , whirl winds, and  dry .  cannot be yet out of your minds I am  what an  succeed∣ed his  Lord of  1652. and then he was in Taurus, an  sign, and therefore you may  by that what you may expect  he is in Leo, which is a sign both siery and violent. In the Sea he ,  occasioned sudden and , by reason of inordinary gusts of  and : In Rivers he dries up  fountains, corrupts and  the water, he signifies a  of corn, and  of grain, wasting them by his pernitious . The truth is, this Eclipse will  as close to the skirts of Italy and Rome her self, as ever a mans skin did to his back, and go near to be the bane of both, as I have often told you before in divers writings of mine: Only one memorable thing I shall here quote; it is the opinion of the , that the Turk is the Antichrist, not the Pope; and therefore Iames Gaf∣farel in his Unheard-of Curiosities, treating of the  of the , shewing when the Turkish Empire should fall, he gives his judgment, that it should fall in the year 1655. the very same year in which in my opinion Rome it  shall fall. But before I give my own , I must premise  line or two. As there is a Trinity in  in the , so hath there been a threefold Administra∣tion of this Trinity to  sons of men since the ; one before the Flood, one after the Flood before Christ, and another since the days of the  of Christ; each of these  Administrations had
its several time of  or darkness. First, Be∣fore the  you may find how  came  it, Gen. 6. 2. The sons of God  the daughters of men that  were fair they took them wives of all which they chose: then said God  shall not always strive with man, &c. Secondly,  Flood, the confusion came in at the  of the Tower of Babel, which indeed  confusion; the History is well known to all, though  Mystery understood by few. Thirdly, That we are in confusion now since the Incarnation of the Lord, is  to all that have but the least knowledg of themselve; but how this confusion began, or how far it extends,  not so readily answered; it is probable it might come in under the first Pope, whose name (I take it) was Gregory; but when we shall get out of it, is the next disquisition. It is not altogether unknown to me by divers  grounds both from the first building of Rome and from the several Chrisis that have since, accord∣ing to that time of building or making it a City, hap∣pened to it, that 1655. will be a fatal, if not a final year to it; and if our spiritual confusion had its rise thence,  is more then probable to me, I have great hopes of liberty, and clear light to walk in it also, so soon as that is destroyed. I  I conceive there are some things yet to be fulfilled before its fall, for the Lord Christ shall destroy the man of sin by the brightness of his , and the Iews whom the Lord hath  for their iniquity must first be gathered together. (Be  and patient, Beloved Iews, the time is not
off; when ye see the Star of Iacob appear in the East, lift up your heads; it is in vain for us Christians to look for happiness without you.) And you fellow Christians and Brethren, let me  you often seriously to read Matth. 24. and see what comfort you can pick out of it. This is most certain, that both the last ☌ of ♄ and ♃, these three Oppositions of Saturn and Iupiter, and the last Eclipse of the Sun, and the Eclipse we now treat of, are not to be parallel'd since the days of Christ, nor perhaps since the world stood: they all manifestly shew a change of Government throughout the whole world: and if there be ano∣ther Government yet to come  the ANCI∣INT of DAYS, spoken of by Daniel, uppear, I may be mistaken; but if otherwise, as is apparent to me both from the Book of the Scriptures, and from the Book of the Creatures, his coming may be during the effects of this Eclipse; if you read but heedfully the second Psalm, you see there some reasons for it: Only let me request two things of you: 1. Do not imagine a hideous coming of Christ in your minds; make not riddles of God and Christ, and every thing else in Religion: indeed it is that which most of your Priests train you up in; he will come in such a way as you little expect him to come in: ne∣ver spend the time whether he shall come in Person or in Spirit, these are  for children to talk of: I dare not write all is revealed to me in the point, for I am forbidden; yet this I say, he shall come as , a Saviour; as CHRIST, ; , God with us.
2. Tye not up your selves to a strict expectation in respect of time; the effects of the Eclipse continues two years and a half, with some advantage; neither doth it begin forcibly to operate till August 1655, for the last Eclipse 1652. will first make an end of working: The best advice I can give you in this case, is this, Look diligently into your own selves, and li∣bor to know your selves very well, there may you find the unity between you and the Godhead, and having found that, you may know what you shall  both in this world, and in that to come. But I must . A general Iudgment of the Year 1654. 'TIs confes∣sed, the figure of this Revolution is generally ill, yet worse by far it would be, were not Iupiter & Ve∣nus better dig∣nified then the rest of the Pla∣nets, and ther∣fore are doser∣vedly to be accounted the Lords of the year.   a temperate ayr, and North winds, yet sud  are very temperate, by which both living  and seeds are strenthened and preserved. ,
although she be much impedited by her neerness to Mars, yet we may conceive some hopes that she will something moisten his heat and dryness, that the  may not want water in that  which it hath done the two former years: this hope may have a further ground, from Iupiter, being in a watry sign; and from the Pleiades, being stars of a tempe∣stuous watring quality, so  the cusp of the As∣cendant; and  from Venus her , being a moist and Sea Star, placed upon the very cusp of the As∣cendant. But let us see a little particularly what the signifi∣cations of the Planets are, as they are constituted in this Scheam; and let none be angry if I begin with the , I my self being a Commoner. The Significators of the Commonalty are twosold, general and particular; generally the Moon signifies the Commonalty, particularly the Ascendant and its Lord: If you look to their particular Significatrix, which is Venus, you shall find her very strong angu∣lar, and in her own house occidental, but slow in motion, neer Retrogradation, very neer the body of Mars; and the Ascendant it self is something  ted by the Pleiades in it: Truly if I would write what I think to be truth, I cannot but guess a safe, though troublesom condition to the Commonalty; it is a year wherein they will much stand upon their priviledges, by doing which they will incur much displeasure, many troubles and many adversaries: I desire my Brethren of the Commonalty that they would make no  this year, they will exceed∣ingly be subject so to do,  yet experience tells
them, that tumults are usually bitterness at the latter end to them that make . I am straitened for want of paper exceedingly; I must speak a word or two of the Moon, who is the general Significatrix of the people, and therefore the more to be heeded. If the Moon be weak and , as she is here, and apply to an infortune, and that infortune be fix∣ed, as here she doth, she signifies an evil state to the people, and detriment in their businesses, want  food, but little gain, many infirmities in their bodies, and no fewer hinderances in their occasions: indeed I am afraid their rash attempts will go near to  many of them in prison this year, and then they  be very stayed men; if they suffer for well doing they will have the more comfort. If that  to which the ☽ applies be Lord of the eighth  from the  of the ☽, as here he is, it signifies  mortality amongst the people; and if it be Mars,  it is now, the  shall come of heat, and  of blood, although ♀, who properly  diseases incident to the year, seem to speak otherwise. As for Kings and Magistrates, Sol their  is in the twelfth house, which is the house of  enemies, calamity and imprisonment; let them  to themselves in time, und tell them I gave  warning of it. If the Sun be weak, and in an evil  at his entrance into ♈, the power and state of  and Magistrates will decrease, and they will do many and evil mischiefs to the people under them;  men wil be regarded never the more for their  nor noble men for their Nobility, but
common people will rise up against their Lords and , thus saith Haly, let them verifie the truth of . I confess here are few receptions to mitigate these evils, here is none at all to help Kings and Ma∣gistrates, there is one which may give some succor to  Commonalty, which is between the ☽ and ♂; happily the Souldier may take part with the , if they do, I cannot help . Let us now come to a particular scanning of the rest of the Planets, and so conclude. Saturn in the  house infortunate, as here he is, tumbles down Kings and Magistrates from the top of hope to the bottom of ; he consumes the fruits of the Earth by blasting and mildew; he sows Darnel a∣mongst the Corn, and makes the  coally; he  away the lives of many children, and makes such as do live stubborn. If ♃ be in the  house fortunate, is  he is, the Nations of that climate shall get profit by their enemies, and much gain, freedom and propriety, by  of  and imprisonment; Kings and Magistrates  have time enough to think on what is past, and occasion enough to repent of their op∣pressions at leasure. Before I proceed any further, take notice of  general rule which is to be observed in all annual Iudgments, none excepted. 1. The estate of the common people is always to be enquired after from the Moon. 2. The estate of Kings, Princes, , and Noble men, from the . 3. The estate of Scribes, Merchants, education of
children, and such as study Arts and Sciences, from ☿. 4. The estate of Iudges, Priests and Lawyers, from ♃ 5. The estate of all Souldiers, and such as  Kings and Kingdoms, Magistrates and Nations  danger, is to be enquired after from Mars. 6. The estate of old men, Husbandmen, and such  till the Earth, is to be enquired after from Saturn. 7. As for all womens matters, and such as belong to delights, joy and feasting, we must have an eye to ♀. If then Priests and Lawyers be signified by Iupiter, you shall find Iupiter just reformed, and coming out of prison; mock not, you may happen to sind the Iudg∣ment true enough. Mars in the  signifies much fear and dam∣age to the Nation by  of their Enemies; but truly my own opinion is, the fear will be more then the harm, Mars is so near Venus: , much con∣tention and quarrelling will be amongst men, but the best is, as good words will butter no parsnips, so  words will not break a  head. Venus in the  health to mens bo∣dies, and joy to their minds: but seeing Venus is so neu Retrogradation, falling retrograte before she touches the degree ascending, I suppose she may well be taken to be in the twelfth House, which if so, she signifies almost all the evil to women that can be imagined; many whoredoms, contentions and quarrellings,  of liberty and good name, besides other  for loving the under-sheet better then the distaff. Mercury in the Twelfth signifies much quarrelling between men and their children, and their servants. Moon in the , the Nations
that sign in which she is (of which England is one) shall be continually brawling and quarrelling, nothing  falling out one with another, as though that were the only way left to thrive. Sol in the Twelfth , that the Kings and Ma∣gistrates of that Climate, of which England is one, shall be exceedingly hated by the people, because they do them much evil, and lay such grievous Taxes upon them. Lastly, Consider, that so many Planets being in the , and the Lords both of the Sixth and Eighth there, as also the Lady of the Fourth, many  like to be committed this year: It will be very dif∣ficult to  out the causes of diseases which happen in this Revolution; only my hope is,  Sun in the Twelfth will bring to light such as deal either in , or invocation of evil Spirits.

An Explanation of the three  Tables. The use of the Tables is very easie; For when you know the day of the Month under the Month, over against the day you find the age of the Moon, which being sound, look it in the Residue of the Tyde Table on the top, and underneath it over against the place you have the hour and minute when  is full Sea. For example: The  day of Ianuary the Moon  23 days old, which if you search in the Residue of the Tyde Table, you shall find that the Moon when she is 8 days old, and when she is 23, maketh  sea at London, 24 min. past  of the clock; and this she doth always, if neither Winds nor Land Floods, &c.  for take notice, that it is  so exactly to shew the time  high water in Rivers of  indrouth, as one may in Sea .

Observations on JANUARY. DEep will the Consultations be this Moneth throughout Europe, and that about such matters  belong not to the vulgar to know; for he that lives to the middle of the Moneth shall see all the Princes of Europe in a maze, and the Commonalty sit by the fire and complain to one another of their oppression: the Alchimist mean season is busie at his furnaces; for saith Haly, the ✶ of ♂ and ☿ promiseth men shall en∣quire much after Alchymy, and such other operations as are performed by fire; I wish them all the desire of their hearts. Certainly this Month will occasion much sadness to many great men, I do not say it will be acted this Month, but occasioned, or consulted a∣bout; Consultations are the forerunners of Resoluti∣ons, and Resolutions of Actions: Mean season the Iesuits beyond Sea, and some of our Priests here, la∣bor so to uphold their Calling or Trade, and hew lo∣gick so to prop it up, that the world will have cause to curse some of them first, and they to bemoan them∣selves afterwards. The Kings of the Earth labor to uphold themselves more then they do the Truth, and the lives and liberties of their poor Subjects; for, for an idle piece of a thing called Honor, as striking sail, or the like, what care Princes how many thousands of Christians lives they throw away? But God will come and make inquisition for blood, and then—Blessed are the Peace-makers, so saith the Scripture, and so say I. The ☌ of ♂ and ♀ gives notice of many fornications, and such like evils; it happens in Aries, the Ascendent for England: The truth is, the neerness of ♂ and ♀ most part of this year gives cause enough to tear many outrages and duels concerning love matters, and that the French disease will be rife e∣nough throughout the Nation.

Observations on FEBRUARY. O curas hominum! O quantum in rebus inane est! THis Month begins pitifully with misty, foggy, stinking, noisom, cloudy, frosty weather, and tur∣bulent actions are probably like to ensue such trou∣blesom weather: Fiat justicia, say I, and all honest men harp upon the same string, though this may hap∣pily make but bad musick in the ears of some great ones, who about this time may probably be either calling to an account, or else such a thing determined. ☍ ☉ ♄ saith Haly, significat quod Reges adversarios habebunt homines de populo, Religiosos & fratres & eos qui legem predicant & his similes; Kings and Ma∣gistrates shall find enemies both amongst the com∣mon people, amongst such as profess Religion, as Fryars, &c. and amongst such as teach the Law: yet shall not all run the wrong way this Month, as in∣deed it hath done long enough; but here is some good to be hoped, that some may be called to an ac∣count of their stewardship, for they must be no long∣er Stewards. I hope the Nation shall have an account given them of their moneys, some such thing or things to this purpose seems now to be in agitation; men pay their money still, and yet the State wants money still, 'tis but fitting the reason were known; men when they know least, suspect the worst. The Law is once more called in question, and there be some that say, They know no reason why they should be governed by the Norman Laws, now the Norman Race is taken away by the same Instrument that brought it in, viz. the Sword. Certainly many overtures will be made about rectifying the Law this Month, 'tis but need, the Lord direct them for the best.

Observations on MARCH. THe Month begins with a slattering countenance, and that is no wonder,  of late found to be the best  in this Nation; but though the Heavens seem to smile, men will have but little cause so to do;  hoc sub . In the Suns ingress into Aries  sind Mars in the very same degree he was in at the Eclipse of the Sun 1652. by which it appears very probable he will this  bring to pass what there he threatened, which what it was see my  Magnatum. The truth is, I doubt the Hollander is undone, and hath lost all that he hath both in the  and West ; as he hath served others there, so is him∣self served, and that's bad enough; his Fleet comes not home at all, or else it comes home by weeping cross. Perhaps it may thunder about the 15 day. I am sorry for the poor Hollander, if it be but because he hath  one vertue we want, he provides for his Poor; yet God is just, and Cruelty will be shewed to his in that very place which he shewed it to others. Those in this Nation are like this Month to be called to an account, which had thought the world would have  always in statu quo. If the Souldier be impetuous, I cannot help it. Ill times are coming and those to no small sools. Our  in this world is but a journey, and they that  their horses in this journey, must be glad to walk . There happens two Aspects towards the latter end of this Month, the effects of which may do wonders: Out of  many great ones will be questioned, and that upon crimes no less then ; They which formerly used to command the People, would now be willing to entreat them, and glad if they would do them any good; but former inju∣ries and oppressions are not  forgotten. The Law is much controverted, and many ; I dare not say  nor .

Observations on APRIL. IT is a remarkable thing, that Saturn falls direct just upon that very degree, and almost the very minute where the ensuing Eclipse of the Sun is to be celebrated, as who should say he would exaspe∣rate the minds of men, and poyson their understand∣ing, that so they may be made sit for the consuming and destroying influences of the Eclipse, as the vi spirit became a lying spirit in the mouths of Ahabs Prophets. We do confess the Month begins very se∣renely with the common people, but it will scarce  so with the great ones. The Law is again  about the beginning of this Month, but to little purpose. If you would hinder the growing of , the best way is to pluck up the Tree by the . Many  Pamphlets are like to be printed this Month, as full of lyes as lines; and ma∣ny questioned for Necromancy, and dealing with o∣ther the like abominable Arts: Women with child must look for hard labors; and people will begin to know toward the latter end of this Month what the difference is between a right Law and a Cheat. Such as have stood stoutly for the Liberty of this Na∣tion in  times, when Will was a Law, may happily be a little esteemed; better late then never: Nunquam sera est ad bonos mores, via. Thunder and Lightening, Rain and  ends the Month; and great men begin to see themselves to be but men; it were a happiness all men in  could but do so .

on MAY. I Can tell you this will be a sad, not a merry Month  May to many;  the Month begins, if not with thundering weather, yet with thundering acti∣ons, such as I am afraid will go neer to cost some body their heads, I cannot help it, they might have looked better to it in time. I am afraid many Alchy∣mists will come off losers this Month in their search  Hermes his Elixic, it is a jewel given but to few;  quot aequus amavit Iupiter, aut ardens  ad Aethera virtus,  geniti potuere. The Month begins with lying, scribling and deceiving; Cheating and cozening are turned two main pillars of the Nation. About the middle of the Month the Law is brought into question once more, and much debating about it, pro and con, but very little conclu∣ded I am afraid: I could wish men could live ho∣nestly and lovingly, and then the Lawyers might leap for a crust, and glad if they could catch it; for 'tis well known that Lawyers get their  by none but mad men and fools. In truth I am afraid of some tumults, or risings, or something to this effect, in this Nation, nay it  be in London: when men have so carried themselves, that they fear  touchstone, because their actions will not hold water, then  next way is to : but I hope the wisdom of our State will look after such things, and prevent them. But toward the latter end of the Month  must be the other  about ordering the Law, and I hope it will be to some purpose: Great men are called in question; Lawyers mourn; Heirs weep for their lost inheritance; Priests mutter and whine; the wind blows, and so the Month ends.

Observations on JUNE. WHen mens actions are not justificable by the Rule of Truth, and Law of Reason, the last shift is to flatter with the people; and when the Lions skin will not serve the turn, to take the Foxes: But when God hath  Iustice shall be done, all the shifts of man will not avail. About the middle of the Month the Lawyars must have another wrangling fit, and so must the Clergy; 'tis a hundred to one if about that time they do not fall out a∣mongst themselves, which has been the cause of their own ruines; They say, When theeves fall out, true men come by their goods again. ' a sad case my masters, if  considered, that after a man hath spent so many thousand pounds in Learning, as the person on Fshstreet-hill said he had spent more in Learning then half his Parish was worth, and burnt out so many  candles in reading old  and his dull-headed Disciples, tired out their poor weak feeble brains in reading old Books, which they call Fathers, spent so much Ink and Paper in writing out their witty sayings, that so they sell them in the Pulpit to get a good handsom honest living, that now all should come to nothing; when a man shall spend whole days and nights in studying the tricks and quillets of Law, that so they may un∣do the poor, and cheat the rich, and when occasion is say the Crow is white, and the Swan black, and now all is come to nothing, would not this make a stone weep, and fetch tears even from a flint? If you hear the wind blow about the middle of the month, take notice such a thing may come to pass; Qui non  cavet post dolebit. Toward the latter end of the month Mars Ioyns with Mercury, and in the very degree where Saturn was at the Eclipse of the Sun 1652. threaten∣ing evil to the common people, perhaps it may  them to be mutinous; if not, they will be full enough of fears and troubles, mind nothing but deceit and cozenage, and falsifying of money: Wise men and wisdom it self will be despised and accounted little worth, and so indeed  al∣ways. Perhaps some honest Philosophers may be questioned about this time for doing good; if they be,  a hundred to one if they may not thank their own pratling tongues, for that's the usual cause of all their evils.

Observations on IULY. MEn give gallant words at the beginning of this Month, and promise the Commonalty much good, and indeed well they may, for good are cheap, and cost nothing; a good word is as soon given as a bad: but the truth is, no body will beleeve a lyar when he speaks truth. Men yet wrangle and repine at the Law, and will not be pacified, no not by peace∣making ♃ himself. Tis a sad thing I confess, when Truth and Equity will not please mens fancies, no not an Angel himself, if he should come down and speak English. The △ of ☉ and ♃ sheweth, that wis∣dom and Philosophy will be apparent and manifest, and the Law common for every one to read; but the ☌ of ☉ and ♂ threatens those places under ♋ with no small and mean evils, such be Scotland, Holland, Zealand, Burgundia, Granado, Charthage, &c. Of Cities and Towns that are like to suffer, are Constan∣tinople, Tunis, Venice, Genoa, York, S. Andrews in Scot∣land, Magdenberg, Wittenberg, &c. Let these places take heed of Mutinies and Seditions; let them take heed of Enemies, and also of their own selves. The Synod of the Sun & Mars is neer the little dog star, I am afraid he will bite, and that Holland will know to their sorrow, which will by this time be looked upon as an undone Nation; neither will the Scots leave their treachery, so long as there is one of them left. Diseases will be stirred up, which will afflict the brest with heat, and perhaps occasion Pestilence, or sudden death: The ☌ happens in the fourth house of the Revolution of the year, whence it is to be feared that it may cause much damage to the fruits of the Earth; it happens in the eight house of the Heavens, and therefore may prove dangerous and mortal to those places subject to its influence.

Observations on AUGUST. Homo Homini Daemon. IT was the speech of one of the Iewish Rabbies, whose name I do not remember, but the words he  when he lay on his death bed, and the last words of dying men are usually longest remembered; If our , said he, come not in the year 1654. that was the man we put to death  Ierusalem. Besides, it was the opinion of an Astrologer of our own, who  long since left England, that the coming of Christ to Raign should be at the instant of the Eclipse this Month; he brought this  to make his Iudgment seem like truth, Zech. 14. The Lord my God shall come, and all his  with him; and it shall come to  in that day, When the light shall not to clear nor dark, but it shall be one day known to the Lord, not day nor night. For  own particular part I understand not the mystery of that Scripture  yet, neither dare I be so critical as to appoint a particular  for  coming; it is sufficient to me that he shall come, and that I have enough to nourish my hopes that it shall be within the effects of this Eclipse. The ☌ of ☉ and ♄  tempestuous weather, and as tempestious actions, which may be read in the  about the midst of this Month by  men, if they heed but those supernatural sights which will be seen there when ♄ leaves the dominion of the Sun, and  himself to the Virgin, being just then at the Aphelion of ♂, and not far off from his body. The Princes of Europe are all in a maze, and all the world in a wonder what God determines to do. It is the property of a wise man to weigh  the begin∣ing of things, and suspend his judgment till he sees the end.

Observations on SEPTEMBER. Libertas, que sera tamon, respexit , Respexit , et LONGE POST TEMPORE venit THat the Normand Race came into this Nation under the Celestial Sign , is a point no way disputable to any Astrologer; neither is it disputable to any wise man in  Art, but that Mars changing his  from Leo to Virgo, would bring an  to that Monarchy. This was the reason Mr Lilly in his  Merline, page 116. against 1654. writes thus, A Virgin Monarchy hath been, but is no more. Mars enters Virgo, and leaves Leo his . At the very beginning of this month happens a Conjunction of  and Mars in two degr. 44 min. of Virgo: But before I proceed to tell you what I think the effects may be, give me leave to  you a little difference between the Danick Ta∣bles of Longomontanus, and  Wing his  Caeleste; By , Mars changed his  in 1650. which what hapned that year, is wel known; but by the  Tables not till the  end of the year 1654. I hold our Countryman Wings Tables to be truest in the  of all the Planets, the Luminaries excepted. But to come to the business in hand; that the  of Saturn and Mars doth always mischief, and never good, unless it be doing good to one by  another, is well known to all those that study Astrology to be an  truth; yet let it not be accounted a Paradox, if I  that the influence of this Conjunction may in all probability do England the greatest good that ever was done to it since William the Ba∣stard conquered it, I mean restore it to its desired Liberty; the Heavens promise such a thing, and I can partly beleeve: that our Slavery came in under the Norman Race, all know that know any thing; and that it may be extinguished by the effects of this , I partly beleeve: If possibly I can procure time I shall write a Treatise of this Conjuncti∣on in a Treatise be it self, the effect, of it  two year.

Observations on OCTOBER. THe Princes of Europe can agree but in one thing, and that is in oppressing the people: A dismal time is a coming both to Priests and Lawyers; many of them are clapped up this Month, and some of them may be made shorter by the head the next: Both these sorts of Cattel were established in their Authority by Will: the Conqueror; and the first game they played after they were established, was acted more wisely then honestly by half, which was to abscond from us the Laws we were governed by before the Conquest; ever since which time we have been bred up like birds in a cage, and know not what liberty we were in before that time: These things are like to called in question about this time. I pray God Paris in France be not fired down to the ground during the effects of this ☌ of ♄ and ♂: It promises Ierusalem to the Iews, I would to God once they had it, for then my joys would be full: The truth is, it happening in a humane sign, it will set all the world together by the ears; and I hope to see the Eastern Empire once in the hands of Christians. The old Laws and Cu∣stoms of this Nation will go near to appear in print this Month, and then we shall know better what Li∣berty is. Philosophers say it is an easier matter to get their Mercury, then to know it, for it is a volatile spirit every where, and in all things. This I know to be a truth, and I do as really beleeve it, it is an easier matter to get our Liberty, then to know what it is. You shall find about the latter end of this Month how Kings and Magistrates will scuffle to maintain their Prerogatives; but the Commonalty will not be content with bread and water, so long as they know where to get rost-meat at a cheap rate.

Observations on NOVEMBER. Fiat Iusticia. THe Magistrates of Europe look with rusul . Repentance sometimes comes too late, and so for all that I know may do now: But O  I Accomptants and Committees must be called to account what they have done with the  of the Nation. It would melt a heart of stone to see how pitifully they look through a prison grate, who have formerly had the world at will, and were such  to think that this life would last always, when day and night teacheth them all things are subject to change. Some new Laws may probably be establish∣ed this Month, and those a little more wholesom then the former, which may perhaps please the peo∣ple better for a little time, till Liberty break out and appear in its colours. A great many Malignants are now found out, which were never  of before, and Iustice speedily executed upon them, and that is a thing pleases God very well. The world in my judgment stands this Month in this , those Kings of Europe which are left are at Wars one with ano∣ther, mean season their own Subjects  them work enough at home, whilest we in England are pretty secure, having found out a pack of great Theeves, and are busie in executing  upon them.

Observations on DECEMBER. ABout the beginning of this Month Magna Charta it self seems to me to be called in que∣stion; and that great Liberty which so many has sought after in their stout contending for the privi∣ledges of Magna Charta, is found out to be nothing else then what this poor pitisul Nation,  it was unluckily vanquished by a Bastard, by fair terms  from the hands of the Conqueror:  suit with English mens  at this time; it is a real truth indeed, we have not so much liberty, or to speak more properly, we are not in greater bon∣dage then Magna Charta tyed us too. The cause of this I conceive to be in our former , who when they should have been  the liberty of their Subject, spent their time in consultation how far the bounds of a Forrest must go, who must keep  Park, and who must not; who must keep Hounds, Greyhounds,  Dogs, and who must not; what price must be payd for shouting of Pigeons, Partridges, and Phesants: and thus they sweeped the Liberty of the Nation up and down, as the maid swept the sur-reverence about the house, till at last she lost it: But the year seems to me to end in a bet∣ter posture, pretty pleasing to  Commonalty, and not without great hopes of our desired Liberty.
