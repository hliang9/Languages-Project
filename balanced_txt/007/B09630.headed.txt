PAUL HOOD, Doctor of Divinity, Rector of Lincoln Colledge, and Vice-Chancellour of the Vniversity of Oxford, to all whom it may concerne, Greeting. Where∣as the Statutes of the University require certaine Scho∣lasticall, and decent Habits, befitting every Person in his severall Degree to be used, and put on, when he shall appear in Publick, especially at Sermons & other Scholastical Exercises. And whereas for divers years last past, there hath been almost a totall neglect, throughout the whole University herein, contrary to the Statues, and good Discipline of the same. We therefore (considering the dishonour that may redound to the University, by this apparent neglect; and that many inconveniences may ensue thereupon, if We shall not with all se∣verity uphold that Laudable Use and Custome) doe Peremptorily, and expressly Require and Command Every Graduate to appear in his Forma∣lities, at Sermons, and elsewhere, according to the Statutes therein pro∣vided. As also Ʋnder Graduates to wear such Gowns and Caps, as are limited, and expressed for their condition. And that these commands may work the speedier redresse; VVe professe to Execute the rigour of the Statues upon such as shall offend therein. Given under my Hand this Eight day of October 1660. PAUL HOOD, Vice-Chan.
