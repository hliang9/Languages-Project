A True and Humble REPRESENTATION of Iohn Downes Esq touching the Death of the Late KING, so far as he may be concerned therein. FInding my self involved by several Votes and Orders of this present Parliament, and also in the execution of the same, with those who plotted and designed the late Kings Death, and with others who were His Judges; I think my self bound in duty and thankfulness unto God, and by all obligations to my self, Family, Posterity, and Relations, to set forth a true Narrative of all things concerning my self, and all my actings in that sad business; and I shall not make Lies a refuge, because I have hope in the God of truth. During that long time of fourteen years I served in the last Parliament, I was never of any Juncto or Cabal, indeed I did ever professedly decline it; I never knew of any business, (except perhaps by hear-say) relating to those sad distractions between the King and Parliament, until they came to be opened in the House; I never knew of the intention of bringing the King to Westminster, till he was brought, much less did I know that the end of His bringing was to take away his life; I never knew of that intention, (except what my own fears might suggest unto me) until the Bill was brought into the House to Erect an High Court of Justice (as it was called) for His Tryal; and therefore I was much perplexed and astonished when it was read; when the Bill was committed, I was not of the Committee, (though it was numerous) nor was I ever at that Committee, (though it sate very publickly in the Speakers Lodgings:) when the Committee had order to bring in Names for Judges, my Name was not put in till after the Amendments were reported, and upon a second Commitment; and then upon an unhappy occasion, passing through the Speakers Chambers, (when the Committee was not sitting) I saw two or three Members (whose Names I well remember) were in consultation at the Table, and as I passed by them, one of them said, this Gentlemans Name is not inserted, and called to me and said, Sir, you must make one in this great business; I flatly gave my denyal, and said, I could not serve them in it; it was replyed, that with my good favour I must take my share: after the Bill was passed, and the Judges summoned to meet in the Painted Cham∣ber, by express Order of the House all were injoyned to attend: And thus through weakness and fear I was insnared. I shall forbear to mention many passages betwixt my self and other Members, at several times when I met with them, (because I fear to be over tedious) though they would much make for my clearing; and therefore I do now humbly come to relate my own demeanour the last day the King appeared at the Court. When the Court was sate, and the King brought, the President told him, that he had been charged with Treason, Perjury, Murther, and other high Crimes committed against the People of this Nation, and that he had refused to give an answer to the Charge, demurring to the Jurisdiction of the Court; That he had been told the Court was satisfied of their own Jurisdiction, and that He was not to be the Judge of it; and that He had had several dayes given him for consideration; and that this was the last day the Court would demand of Him, whether He would answer to the Charge or not; if not, the Court would take the whole Charge, Pro Confesso, and would proceed to Judgment; (or words to this effect.) The King (with such undaunted composedness and wisdom, as I never beheld in man) made answer to this effect; That He could not acknowledge the Jurisdiction of the Court, He acknowledged they had power enough indeed, but where is your authority? yet said He, because I see you are ready to give a Sentence, and that such a Sentence may sooner be repented of, than revoked; and that the peace of the Nation may so much depend upon it. I think sit to let you know, that I desire to speak with my Parliament, for I have something to offer unto them which will be satisfactory [to you all] and will be for the present Settlement of the Nation. The President regarded not these gracious expressions, but told Him, he could take no notice of any thing He said, save only to demand once again, whether He would answer to His Charge or not. Then the King (not in passion) but with the greatest earnestness of affection, desired the Court, that they would once more consider of it; for said He, you may live to repent of such a Sentence; and therefore desired they would withdraw but for half an hour; or said He, if that be too much trouble for you, I will withdraw, (and passionately moved his body.) The President was not affected with all this, but commanded the Clerk to read the Sentence; God knows I lie not, my heart was ready to burst within me; and as it fell out, sitting on the seat next to Crumwel, he perceived some discomposure in me, and turned to me and said, What ailes thee, art thou mad, canst thou not sit still and bequiet? I answered, quiet? no sir, I cannot be quiet; and then I presently stood up, and with an audible voyce said, My Lord President, I am not satisfied to give my consent to this Sentence, but have reasons to offer to you against it; and therefore I desire the Court may adjourn to hear me. Then the President stood up and said, nay, if any Member of the Court be unsatisfied, then the Court must adjourn, and accordingly did adjourn into the inner Court of Wards. When the Court was sate there, (all but Members, and some Officers being turned out) I was called by Crumwel to give an Account why I had put this trouble and disturbance upon the Court? I answered, (and so near as possibly I can, after so great an clapse of time, I will set down my very Syllabical expressions:) My Lord Pre∣sident, I should have been very glad, that his Majesty would have condescended to these expressions long before this time; I say, I should have been glad of it, both for His own sake and for ours; But sir, to me they are not too late, but welcome now, for sir, God knows I desire not the Kings death, but His life; all that I thirst after, is the Settlement of the Nation in peace; His Majesty now doth offer it, and in order to it desires to speak with His Parliament; should you give Sentence of Death upon Him, before you have acquainted the Parliament with His offers, in my humble opinion, your case will be much altered, and you will do the greatest Action upon the greatest disadvantage imaginable, and I know not how ever you will be able to answer it. Crumwel in some scornful wrath stood up and answered me, (so near as I can remember in these words) My Lord President, you see what weighty Reasons this Gentle∣man hath produced, that should move him to put this trouble upon you; surely this Gentleman doth not know, he hath to deal with the hardest hearted man upon the earth; however sir, it is not the single opinion of one peevish tenacious man, that must sway the Court, nor deter them from their duty in so great a business; and I wish his Conscience doth not tell him (what ever he pretends of dissatisfaction) that he only would save his old Master; Therefore sir, I pray you lose no more time, but return to the Court and do your duty. Not one soul would second me nor speak one word, yet I knew divers by name; Sir John Bourcher, Mr. Dixwel, Mr. Love, Mr. Waite, and some others were much unsatisfied, yet durst not speak; But on the contrary divers Members took their turns with me in private discourse; Crumwel himself whispered me in the ear, and said, by this and Mr. Fries business he was satisfied. I aimed at nothing but making a mutiny in the Army, and cutting of throats; Another told me the Gene∣rations to come would have cause to curse my actings; and another (which sunk deepest of all) told me, that if I were in my wits I would never have done this, see∣ing I was before (as indeed I was) acquainted, that the King to save his life, would make these offers, but it would be as much as my life were worth to make any di∣sturbance; And besides said he, it is not in the power of man, no of this Parliament to save his life, for the whole Army are resolved, that if there be but any check or demur in giving judgment, they will immediately fall upon him and hew him to peices, and the House it self will not be out of danger. To those whose height would permit me to speak and make replies, I told them, to me it was evident, the Parliament expected some such offers from the King, why else did they make that order, (that upon any emergency which could not be thought of, that the Court should immediately acquaint the House therewith: and there was such an order entred and to be seen in the Books, if he (who in appearance) ordered all matters, hath not torn that order out, as I have heard he hath done all the rest of the proceedings; and inferred, what greater emergencies could be, than that the King demurred to the Jurisdiction of the Court, and yet desired to speak with the Parliament, and offered to do that which would be satisfaction to all, especially seeing (as was pretended) that his denying to do such things, was the ground which forc'd such a proceeding with him. And so without any more debate they returned to the Court, and I left them, and went into the Speakers Chamber, and there with tears eased my heart. The effect and substance of this narration is true, and so neer as I can remember the very words and circumstances, and it was so noto∣rious and publick, that I hope God will stirr up some worthy persons (though I have been careless not doing the same in design) to attest the truth of the chief parts hereof; but for any thing else relating to that business, I utterly deny and protest against it, nor did I ever give them one meeting more, but wholly from that time deserted them, though I was often Summoned to meet them in the Painted-Chamber; and I hope persons of so great wisdome and goodness, will suffer compassions to rise within them, and will look back unto those times wherein it was criminal for a man but to whisper a word of respect to His Majesty; and my very subsistance was by an Office upon which I had laid out almost my whole Estate: And as this relation shews I am but a weak imprudent man, yet I did what I could, I did my best, I could do no more: I was single, I was alone, only I ought not to have been there at all; I acknowledge my self to have highly offended and need pardon, and do humbly and professedly lay hold on His sacred Majesties gratious pardon; and humbly implore the high and honourable Parliaments Pardon also. I did not only forbear, but ab∣horred to buy one penniworth of the Kings Goods, or one foot of His Lands, though it's known I had as much or more opportunity than any other man, and per∣haps more temptations o have allured me than most other men had; I have neither taken advantage nor grown rich, nor have had remuneration or allowances for a∣ny Parliamentory services or imployments, as many others had, though it is well known what burthens have been laid upon me: the truth of this will be found, when Books and Treasuries shall be searched into; I may truly say, I have wore out my self, lost my Office, robbed my relations, and ow am ruined; and my Estate when searched into, will not be found as perhaps may be supposed; I have a poor Wife big with child, and eight children besides, and most of them very small, who already are forc'd to live upon charity, all my Estate being siezed on; I was the only Member in the House that was prevailed with, to deliver Mr. Loves Wifes Petition for sa∣ving of his life, and so managedit, that the House devided upon the question, and lost it but by three voyces; & I did not a little contribute to the saving of the lives of Mr. Jackson, and Mr. Jenkins, Ministers, who were in Mr. Loves condition; I have not been cruel to any, I hope God will incline the hearts of His sacred Majesty, and the High Court of Parliament, to be merciful to me and mine.
