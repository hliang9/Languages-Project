At the COURT at WHITEHALL, The Seventeenth day of January, 1676/7. By the KINGS Most Excellent Majesty, and the Right Honourable the LORDS of His Majesties Most Honourable Privy-Council. WHEREAS upon the Humble Petition of Sir John Clayton Knight, setting forth, That by vertue of His Majesties Letters Patents he had Erected, at above Two thousand Pounds Charge, several Light-houses upon the Northern Coasts, for the Benefit of Naviga∣tion; One of which being at St. Nicholas-Gatt near Yarmouth, and of great use to Ships sailing on that Coast, as well as the Fisheries, the Petitioner, at the Instance of the said Town, and of the Masters of Ships there, and in other Parts upon that Coast, kindled the same: Of which the Trinity-house of Deptford made Complaint to this Board, and gave several Reasons why the said Lights should be extinguished, as useless and dangerous: All which the Petitioner having answered, His Majesty was pleased (amongst other things) by Order of the Eleventh of August last, to recommend the Consideration of the Arguments severally brought as well by the said Trinity-house, as by the said Sir John Clayton, touching the Expediency or Inexpediency of the said Lights, to the Bayliffs, Justices, and Masters of Ships at Yarmouth, who were fully and impartially to report their Opinion touching the general or particular Usefulness of each of the said Lights, and how far they, and the Masters and Mariners belonging to that Place, are consenting to pay for the Erecting and Maintenance of the same. In pursuance whereof, there being presented to the Board Certificates signed as well by the Bayliffs and Justices, as by the Masters of Ships and Ma∣riners of Great Yarmouth aforesaid, representing, That after long Debate amongst them, and serious Consideration of the whole matter, it was con∣cluded and agreed most unanimously, both by the said Bayliffs and Magistrates, and all the said Mariners then appearing (except one William Rix) That the said Light at St. Nicholas-Gatt, as it is now erected, if it be blinded until it come upon the West-and-South, to prevent the danger of the South-head of New-orke and the Knowle, is and will be greatly useful and advantageous to Trade, and a great Security to all Ships that shall pass that way, and may be a happy means to prevent for the furture the loss of the Lives of many Persons, and to preserve their Shipping and Goods from Wrecks; and that the said Light will in all probability be a great means to encrease and encourage the Fishery of those Parts; insomuch that they shall at all times be ready to joyn their Assistance to obtain a Confirmation of His Majesties Grant to him the said Sir John Clayton; the Magistrates of the said Town declaring their free Consent to the Payment to him and his Assigns, for and in respect of the Benefit of the said Light, One Farthing per Ton, and no more, for such of their Laden Ships and Vessels as shall pass by the said Light: And the said Masters of Ships and Mariners adjudging One Farthing per Ton to be but a reasonable Allowance for every Light and Loaden Ship, except such Ships as shall hap to come from any Port Northwards of this Town, into the Harbour, and there unlade; they apprehending such Ship to have no Benefit by the said Light. Which having been read at the Board, and it appearing, That by the aforesaid Certificates there was not any mention made of the Light-houses erected by the said Sir John Clayton at Cromer, Flambrough-head, and Farn-Island, which by the aforesaid Order of the Eleventh of August was likewise referred to their Consideration; It was the First of December last Ordered, That the Bayliffs and Magistrates of the Town of Yarmouth should inform themselves by the Masters and Owners of Ships, and Mariners of that Town, and Parts adjacent, of the Expediency or In∣expediency of each of the said Lights erected by the said Sir John Clayton, at Cromer, Flambrough-head, and Farn-Island, and report their Opinion touching the same to this Board; which they accordingly did this day, as followeth; Viz. In Obedience to an Order of Your Majesty in Councill, bearing date the First day of December last past, requiring us Your Majesties Bayliffs and Magistrates of the Town of Great Yarmouth to inform our selves by the Masters and Owners of Ships, and Mariners of our Town, and Parts adjacent, of the Expediency and Inexpediency of the several Light-houses erected by Sir John Clayton Knight, at Cromer, Flambrough-head, and Farn-Island, and to report their Opinion touching the same, and how far the Masters and Marines belonging to this Place are consenting to pay for the Erecting and Maintenance of the said Lights, or any of them: We therefore the said Bayliffs and Magistrates whose Names are hereunto subscribed, in pursuance of Your Majesties said Order, do humbly certifie, That on the Nine and twentieth of December last, we did summon the greatest part of the best and most experienced Sea-men, Masters and Mariners of our said Town, then at home, to appear at our Common-Hall; and upon an indifferent and impartial Proposal of the Objections, Answers, and Observations made and given in reference to each and every of the said New-erected Lights, it was concluded and most unanimously agreed by all the said Mariners then present, as appears by their several Subscriptions remaining by and with us the said Bayliffs, That the said Light-house erected on Flambrough-head, was very happily designed, and if built than now it is, will be greatly useful to Trade, particularly to the Collery, and a great Security to all Ships that shall pass that way. We do further humbly certifie, That at the same time and place, and upon debate of he Objections, Answers, and Observations aforesaid, the Light-house erected at Cromer, and the other at Farn-Island, were by the generality and greatest of the said Masters and Mariners agreed and subscribed to, to be useful and necessary, and commodiously situated for the Benefit of Navigation; but by the residue apprehended and judged to be of less use and importance: And that the said Masters and Mariners so approving of the said Lights, are consenting to the Payment to him the said Sir John Clayton, and his Assigns, for and in respect of the apparent Benefit and Advantage of the said Lights so erected at Cromer, Flambrough-head, and Farn-Island aforesaid, One Farthing per Ton, and no more, for each and singu∣lar the said Lights, for such of their Loaden Vessels as shall happen at any time to pass by any or every of them. All which matter is in all humble manner certified and submitted to Your Majesties Princely Wisdom and Consideration, by Your Majesties most loyal, most dutiful, and most obedient Subjects, Bayliffs. Rich. Huntington, Ben. England, All which being taken into consideration, and the said Sir John Clayton by his humble Petition praying liberty to continue the Lights by him ere∣cted, and that the Grant now lying before the Lord Chancellor, being onely an Explanation of his former Patent, may pass the Broad-Seal; It was thought fit, and accordingly ordered by His Majesty in Council, That the said Bill for explaining His Majesties former Grant to Sir John Clayton, for Erecting the several Light-houses aforesaid, upon the Northern Coasts, do pass the Great Seal of England: And that the said Sir John Clayton do take especial care that the Light-house erected by him at St. Nicholas-Gatt, aforesaid, be blinded until it come upon the West-and-by-South, to prevent the danger of the South-head of New-orke and the Knowle, as is advised in the first-recited Certificate. And His Majesty doth farther re∣commend it to the said Sir John Clayton, to raise the Light at Flambrough-Head somewhat higher than now it is, if he shall be thereunto desired by the Masters of Ships and Mariners Trading on that Coast. EDWARD WALKER.
