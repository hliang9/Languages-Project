Enormytees vsyd by the Clergy. Here floweth dy∣uers enormytees vsyd by the Clergy / and by some wryters theyr adherentis / and specyally agaynst the heresy of symo¦ny vsyd by the Clergy. ¶How some of the Clergy and theyr adherentis causeles haue sklāderous¦ly spoken agayns this noble realme of Englande and agayns dyuers of the Kynges lay subiectes / and haue prechyd & wrytyn agaynst small offē∣sys / leuyng ye greter offensys in the law of god vntouheyd. Ca. i.
THe grace of our lorde Ihu Chryst / the charyte of god / and the comuny¦cacyon of ye holy goste / be euer with our noble Kyng with his nobles & coun∣sellours and with vs all Amen. OF late tyme aboute the begynnȳg of this presente parlyament / that was begonne the thryd day of No∣vember in the .xxj. yere of the Reygne of our moste drad soueraygne lorde yt now is / Kyng henry the yght, defensor of our feyth / when the clergye hard tell that the greate extorcyon that they had long tyme vsed / in the wrongfull takyng of mortu∣aryes / and by probate of testamentys / shulde be reformed / and more meanely qualyfyed to the greate relyfe and com∣forte of all the kynges laye subyectes / Then one of theym stode vp / and sayde opynly / that it was to be feared that the comons of this realme of Englonde / be mych infected with heresye bycause they intendyd to minyshe and to plucke from
the churche ye lybertyes of Chrystes chur∣che / dredyng that thereby it myght for∣tune to this realme / as lately be fell to the realme of Boeme / that was the sub¦uercion of that same realme / But it se∣myth that therin ye clarke there opyned his couetous stomake / then callynge theyr wrongfull exaccyōs to be the lyber¦tyes of Christes church / nat consideryng that there be .ii. lybertyes in the churche / one that is temporall that hath be geuyn by the kyng & by his noble progenytours which may be resumed by lyke auctoryte And there is an other spirytuall lyberty that comyth only from god / that is spokē of .i. Coryn .iij. sayeng Our lorde is the spyryte / and where the spyryte of god is / there is lybertye / and that lybertye none Emperoure ne Kyng can ne may take from the churche. ¶Now although percase the sayde clerk be a famouse doctor / & precher of ye wor∣de of god / and be also a chaste man of his body / yet it aperyth euydētly by yt seyeng
that he is sore infected wt Aueryce / which is the seruytude and bondage of Idolls and is also roote of all euylls / god of his grace amend it in hym and all other / but he wolde nat there speke of ye volupteous conuersacion / and extorcion / and other abhomynacyōs of the clergy / that ryseth of the superfluite of theyr temporall posses¦sions / and of the mysusyng thereof / ney∣ther of the vsurpacion of theyr temporall dyngnytes and auctorytes / neyther yet of the grete and moste detestable heresye of symonye vsed and longe tyme accusto∣med among theym selfys / as shall be sayde here after. ¶And also sythyn that tyme of ye begyn∣nyng of this same forsayd presente par∣lyamente it hath byn a comon sayeng of dyuerse of the clergy / that there were ne¦uer so many herytykes in Englond / as be now at this present day / yea and also dyuerse of the lay gentlemen lerned in the comon law of this realme / and other folkes beyng of kynred or hauyng offy∣ces
/ fees or rewardes or belyechere of the clergy / with a counterfett petye / mo¦nefully affyrme / and openly speke the∣same / wherein it semyth that they be nat well circumspect in theyr sayenges / for onlese that they be able to name / and to bryng forth those persons that they speke of / and meane it by / and also that they can shew theyr opynyons / and can proue them to be heretycall / It shulde ells seme to be a greate blasphemy to the Kynges hyghnes / beyng moste catholyke and chrystyane defensor of the feyth And also to be an vnnaturall and execrable sclan¦der to his most honorable counsel / to this his hygh courte of parlyament / and to all this noble and good catholyke realme / wherein is no lytell offence yf it be well considered. ¶And yet percase in theyr so sayng all though they mystake the lay fee therein yet regardyng the cler¦gy in theyr sayd sayenges / they may for∣tune to say more trewly therin than they be ware of / as shalbe sayd hereafter /
¶And although the heresye of dyuerse of the clergye shalbe here sum what spo∣ken of / yet the good sorte of good catho∣lyke and vertous clerkes be nat offēded thereby / for this wryter and compyler / euer hath sayd / and contynually wyll say with saynt Austen / O veneranda sacer¦dotum dignitas / in quorum manibus dei filius velud in vtero virginis incar∣natur / O felices sacerdotes / si sacerdo∣taliter vixeritis. &.c. yet of the voluptu∣ous and heretycall sorte of the clergye it may be sayde in contrary wyse as thus / O misera et detestanda superborum / cu∣pidorum / Iracūdorum / luxuriancium / gulosorum / Inuidorum / accidiosorum / voluptuosorum & hereticancium sacerdo∣tum / animalis & diabolica condicio / in quorum manibus dei filius iterum quan¦tum in vobis est) crucifigitur & morti tra∣ditur / et non defensi sepulcro / {sed} fetido sterquilinio mittitur / videlicʐ in ora et cor¦pora sacerdotū multiphariis viciis & heresi plenorum / O infelices sacerdotes / si non
sacerdotaliter vixeritis / And it is sayd Dist. xl. Ca. multi sunt. &.c. that there be many prestes / and that there be but few prestes / many in name and but few indede / and therof reade in aboke called Dextra pars oculi sacerdotis. ¶And also where some men haue lately taken greate study & pleasure / to ympung a vertuous Clerke & a good holsom pre∣cher of ye word of god / so estemed to be in the opyniō of many good mē / & also dyuer¦se mē hath byn sett wt theyr talles in theyr handes to wryte & to marke many of his sayenges in ye pulpit thynkyng therby to confounde / to abiure or to brenne hym / wherein appered greate lacke of good be¦nygnyte / & of charyte / & therby semith to appere greate plentye of craftye & ēuyo{us} cruelnes / & also some mē wryte agaynst dyuerse good catholyke & crystyn laymē / callyng some of theym ī mockage / ye pacy∣fyer & some other of them Euāgelyke bro¦ders / & other dyuerse names at theyr ple∣sure / wtout any louȳg & frainall spryte of
good councell / or of charytable or secrete reformacyon. ¶And also they haue taken greate study in confutyng of some other mens wry∣tynges / which they thought to be erro∣neous / and it semyth to them to be well∣don ¶But yet percase it may be sayd to suche wryters of those thynges which be but tryfles in comparyson of other great matters that they neuer lust to speke ne to wryte of / & yet they be greate errours & comōly vsed / as Chryst sayd to ye phary¦seys Ipocrytys / Math. xxiij. & Luc. xi.
