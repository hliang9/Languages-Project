The crost Couple, OR A good Misfortune. Which in a pleasant Ditty discovers, The fortunate cross of a couple of Lovers. To a New Northern Tune, much in fashion. ILle tell you a tale no stranger than true, of a fa la la la la la The sport on't is old, but the Sonnet is new 'tis a fa la la &c The story sprung from under a Bush From a tongue & a tune as sweet as a thrush But I fear it will make a fair Lady to blush with a fa &c. Nay do not turn your faces away with a fa &c. Here's nothing that can your Vertue betray with a fa &c. Let not your fancies look a squint, The Author would never have put it in Print If there had béen any uncivil word in't but a fa &c. I tell you no tales of Battels & fights with a fa &c. Of wonders, of Monsters of Goblins or sprights, with a fa &c. Nor yet of a Thief that got a reprieve I do not intend your spirits to grieve My story's as old as Adam & Eve with a fa &c. I went to walk one Evening-tide with a fa &c. My fancy did lead me by a Wood side with a fa &c. 'Twas in the prime of all the spring Which giveth delight to every thing, I saw a Maid lien to hear a man sing to her fa &c. The tempting dressings that she was in with a fa &c. Would almost seduce a new Saint to the sin with a fa &c. She was a fair & lovely maid About her wast his Arm he laid The beautiful'st baggage is soonest betrai'd to a fa &c. I got me strait up into a tree with a fa &c. Where I might see all, and no man see me with a fa &c. The tree was thick and full of growth The top on't did hover so over them both That if I had ell, I had dropt in her mouth or her fa &c.
There many amorous glances they cast with a fa &c. But that was not all, the best is at last with a fa &c. Something it seems the youth would do Which she would not consent unto Have patience, & you shall know e're you go with a fa &c. When laid on her side, she turn'd to the tree with her fa &c. I durst have sworn she had look'd upon me with her fa &c. He many points of division did run But she cryd out no, I shall be undone He tun'd up his pipes though, & thus he begun to her fa &c. Oh come my own dear let's dally a while with a fa &c. Thou hast quicken'd my spirits now with a smile and hy fa &c. The trembling of thy lips do show Thou hast no power to say me no Which makes me have a moneths mind unto thy fa &c. This hearty kisse is a sign thou wilt yield to thy fa &c. The white of thy eyes speak peace in the field with a fa &c. Their for a Vail to hide thy face Ile cloud thee with a sweet embrace There's many would with that they were in thy place with their fa &c. Oh do not sigh to hear me intice, with a fa &c. Thou ne'r hadst béen got hath thy mother been nice with her fa &c. Then prethée put me out of my pain For I am now in a merry vain Let's play at that game, where the losers do gain with their fa &c. But oh my own dear why lyest thou so still with thy fa &c. Art thou in a swound or what is thy will with thy fa &c. I prethee joy take no such grief, Since I am so ner to thy relief Oh let me play the amorous Thief with thy fa &c. My dearest of all, why hold'st thou so fast with a fa &c. Ile swear we will marry if thou wilt make hast with thy fa &c. Cupid doth give us leave to play Thy very blushes do betray That thou dost interpret what I have to say with a fa &c. Then on her brow her vail she spread with a fa &c. As if he had been going to cut off her head with his fa &c. He with his Lips her mouth did wipe, And gave her many an earnest gripe For just now my Lady was yielding ripe with her fa &c. In what a fret was I in the tree with a fa &c. That I had not then another by me with her fa &c. Then I perceiv'd they whisper'd a while With many fair pleadings he did her beguile Sure something he shew'd her which made her to smile with a fa &c. He said he was sure he could not be spy'd with a fa, &c. But I if I durst could have told him he ly'd with his fa &c. I feard I should be brought to light She so often cast up her Eyes so bright The pleasures of Love did so dazle her sight and her fa &c. My Gamester could no longer forbear her fa &c. No more should I if I had been there by her fa &c. I turn'd and scrued my body round, To sée my gallant scale the Town But his getting up made me tumble down with a fa &c Such was my fate, no mischief I had with a fa &c. My Lovers both run as if they'd béen mad with their fa &c. And now I hope a warning 'twill be How they in such sinful pleasures agree For fear of the Devil that fell from the tree with his fa la la la la la la. Printed for F. Coles T Vere J. Wright and J Clarke.
