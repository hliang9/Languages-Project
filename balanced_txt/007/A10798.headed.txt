And bycause this noble duke was not maryed his lordes and nobles with one assente besought hym to marye and take a wyfe / to thentente that his lygnage myghte be multyplyed there by / and that they myghte haue a ryghte heyre to enheryte his londes after his dysce∣se. To the whiche requeste this good duke answe∣red and sayde. My lordes what thynge that ye thin¦ke best for me to do shal be done / vpon a condicion in that ye wyl that I be maryed that ye puruey me a wyf accordinge to myne estate for and yf I shold coueyte ony heyer or noblyer of blode thā I am my self that myght not stonde with ryght. and yf I ta¦ke one that is not of so noble an house as I am that sholde be to me grete shame & al my lygnage wher¦fore me thynke it were better yt I kepte me as I am than to do that thynge that sholde not be myne ho∣neste

her maystresse answered and sayde your doughter menes by her pointynge that this daye ye haue got¦ten the bataylle and victorye thorowe the helpe of youre fole robert & the race that is in his face he ha¦the gotten it in the batayle. the Emperoure vnder¦stondyng the mynde and intent of his doughter he was angry and sayde to her maysters. ye sholde te∣che & lerne my doughter wysdome & no folye ne pe∣uyshnesse wher with all I am myscōtent the dough¦ter seynge that her fader was angry pointed no mo¦re not withstondynge she wyst well that it was tre¦we that she pointed and mente / for in as moche as she had sene ye aūgell brynge hȳ the hors & harneis This remaynde in this wyse a certeyne season and after that the sarasyns were put to flyghte by the romayns as sayde is yet came the senesshal agayne with moche more company & layde syege to Rome & the romaynes sholde haue lost the fylde ayen had not the knyghte on the white horse bene to whome god sent horsse and harnays as he had done before to make shorte tale this knyght dyde so moche that the sarasyns were put to flyght & ye romayns won̄e the felde & victorye as they dyde before. there were some of the emperours meyny layde wayte where this knyghte became. But as soone as the batayle was done he was gone noo man coude tell were he was become saue oonly the Emperours doughter whiche se hȳ at ye fontayne agayne vnarmynge hȳ ¶ How Robert gatte the thyrde batayle as he dyde before whiche she kepte secrete.
IN a shorte tyme after this the senesshal tour¦ned ageyne wt a moche greter power than he hadde before & layd syege to rome and yet yt them¦peroure rode to the batayle he commaunded his knyghtes & barones to take good hede fro whens that knyghte came wt the white horsse and what he was and where he became for he hadde grete desyre to knowe what he was / The knyghtes answered it sholde be done the daye came that they must ryde forth to the batayle and serteyne of yt best knyghtes rode pryuely into a wood that stode a lytell there be¦syde & there they wayted whiche waye the knyghte on the white horsse sholde come to the batayle but they loste theyr laboure for they coude not tell whēs he come / But whan they sawe hym in the batayle they rode towarde him to helpe hym and receiue hȳ this same batayle was sore foughten on both par∣tyes / but the sarasyns loste there courage for robert layde on so greate and myghty strokes that no mā myght stonde vnder his honde so that in conclusyō Robert dyde so moche and so valyantly that the sa¦rasyns were put to the dyscomfyture where of the Emperour was greatly enioyed and the senesshall with ye sarasyns were passynge angry and sore mo¦ued therwith all. ¶ How one of the emperoures knyghtes hurte Ro¦bert in the thyghe with a spere. THan whā this batayle was done euery mā rode home and Roberte wolde haue tour∣ned agayne to ye fontayne to vnarme hȳ as he was
wonte to do before / but the foresayd knyghtes we∣re torned agayne in to the wode / to a wayte for the knyght with the whyte hors and whan they sawe hym come they rode all at ones out of the wode & cryed with a loude voyce saynge vnto hym. O no∣ble knyght tarye & speke with vs / and tell vs who that ye be & whens & out of what londe ye come / to the entent that we maye shewe it to the Emperour whiche specyally he desyreth for to knowe. Roberte this herynge was sore a shamed & smote his why∣te hors with his sporres flyngynge ouer hylles and ouer valeyes for bycause he wolde not be knowen but there folowed hym a bolde knyght / well horsed wt a spere wenynge to haue kylled his whyte hors but be myste and smote roberte in the thyghe with his spere / and the spere heed brake of & stacke styll in his thyghe but yet for all this he coude gete no knowlege of the knyght with the whyte hors for he rode from them all euerychonc / wherof they were passynge sory. Roberte rode so sore tyll at ye last he came to the fontayne & vnarmed hym & layde the harnays on the hors as he had done before whiche in cōtynent was vanysshed awaye & gone & he dre∣we out the spere heed out of his thyghe & hyd it by¦twene two grete stones by the fontayne than he lay¦de grece & mosse vpon his woūde for he durst let no man loke therto / for fere he sholde haue bene kno∣wen. And all this sawe & marked the Emperours doughter / forbycause she se yt Roberte was a fayre & wel fauoured yonge knyght she began to cast her loue vnto hym. And whan Roberte had dressed his
wounde he came in to the halle / to gete hym some mete & he halted as lytel as he coude & kepte it secre¦tely yt almoost no man coude perceyue it & suffred more payne a thousande tymes thā it semed by hȳ Shortly after this came home ye knyght yt had hur¦te Roberte. And began to recoūte to thēperour how the knyghte wt the whyte hors had out ryden hȳ & how he had hurte hȳ sore ayenst his wyll. And sayd to ye Emperour. I beseche you my lorde Emperour here what I shall tell you how / and in what maner ye shall knowe who he is that hath holpen you it is best ye make a proclamacyon & publysshe thrughe out your Empyre / & yf there be ony knyght in why¦te harnays and a whyte hors that he be brought to your presence and that he brynge with hym the spe¦re heed where with all he was hurte in his thyghe shewynge the woūde / & yt ye gyue hym your dough∣ter to wyfe and halfe your Empyre with her / them¦perour this herynge was of his counseyll very glad and in contynent in all haste proclamed and puply¦shed thrughe out all his Empyre and thought that the knyght had gyuen hym good coūseyll. ¶ How the Seneshall thruste a spere heed in to his thyghe wenynge to haue begyled themperour and to haue wonne his doughter therby. IT befell in shorte tyme after yt the Seneshal hadde knowlege and vnderstandynge of the Emperoures proclamacyon and howe he myghte wynne themperoures doughter whiche he had ma¦ny tymes bene aboute he dyde grete dylygence and
caused to be sought & goten a whyte hors and why∣te harnays & thryste a spere heed in his thyghe we∣nynge therby to deceyue themperoure and to gete his doughter to wyfe / and whan this was done he commaunded all his men to arme theym and rode with hym to the Emperour and he rode so sore tyll he came to Rome with grete royalte and solace & without ony taryenge he rode streyght to the Em∣perour saynge to hym in this wyse / my lorde I am he that you so valyaūtly many tymes receyued thre tymes I haue caused you to haue honour & vyctory ayenst the cursed sarasyns / themperour thȳkynge vpon no treason nor dysseyte sayd ye be a valyaūt & a wyse knyght but I had wente the contrarye for we haue taken you for a vylayne and a forsworne knyght / the Seneshall was very angry & sore mo¦ued here withall and answered themperour shortly and angerly / my lorde Emperour meruayll you no¦thynge here of for I am not suche a cowarde as ye wene that I be & thus saynge he toke out the spere heed and shewed it the Emperoure and vncouered the wounde the whiche he had made hym selfe in his thyghe the knyght stode by whiche that hurte Roberte before and began to cōpasse in his mynde for he se well yt it was not the heed of the spere but he durst saye nothynge for fere leest the Seneshall wolde haue kylled hȳ we wyll leue now of the Se¦neshall & speke of Roberte whiche is amonge dog¦gers sore wounded as ye haue herde. ¶ How god sente his aungell to the heremyte yt he
sholde go to rome and seke Roberte for he had full done his penaunce. THe heremyte whiche ye haue herde of before that shroue and sette Roberte his penaunce laye on a nyght in his selle and slepte and thus sle∣pynge there came to hym a voyce / and badde hym lyghtly a ryse and go to Rome to the place where Roberte was doynge his penaunce / and the aun∣gell tolde the heremyte all the doynges of Roberte shewynge how that his penaunce was fuldone and that god hadde forgyuen hym his synnes wherof the heremyte was verye gladde and in the mornyn¦ge eerly he rose and wente to Romewarde / and in lyke wyse in the same mornynge the Seneshal rose be tyme and wente to Rome to the Emperoure to desyre and haue his doughter accordynge to the pu¦blycacyon and crye / the whiche the Emperour con∣sented her to hym without ony longe aduysement / But whan the doughter vnderstode that she was gyuen to the Seneshall she raylled and raged as though she hadde ben wood and madde she tare her here from her heed and all to tore her clothes but it myght nothynge auayll her for she was constray∣ned and must be arayed lyke a bryde and an Em∣peroures doughter whiche sholde be maryed and the Emperour ladde her by the hande hymselfe to the chyrche royally accompanyed with lordes and ladyes and gentylwomen but the doughter made the gretest sorowe of the worlde in so moche that no man coude content her mynde.
¶ How the Emperours doughter thrughe the gra¦ce of god began for to speke the fyrst that euer she spake in her lyfe. THan as the Emperour with all his estate was come in to the chyrche the Emperures doughter whiche was dumbe sholde marye the Se¦neshall there dyde our lorde a fayre myracle for the loue of the holy man Roberte to the entente he shol¦de be exalted / whome euery body helde for a fole and with hym mocked whan the preest sholde be∣gyn the seruyce & to marye the Seneshall and this yonge mayde togyder / the doughter thoroughe the grace of god began to speke to the Emperour her fader in this wyse / fader I holde you not wyse but fer ouer sene in that ye byleue / that this proude fo∣lysshe traytour telleth you / for all that he telleth you it lyes / but here in this towne is a holy and deuoute persone / for whose sake god hath gyuen me my spe¦che wherfore I loue hym in my herte for I haue all waye sene and marked his valyaunce and holynes but noo man wolde byleue me what poyntynge or sygnes that I made / than the Emperour this he¦rȳge was almoost out of his mȳde for Ioye whan he herde his doughter speke whiche neuer spake be¦fore / wherby he knewe well ynoughe the Seneshal this herynge was wood angry and foule ashamed and lyghte vpon his hors and rode awaye and all his companye the pope there beynge presente axed the mayde who the man was that she spoke of / than the mayde ladde the pope and the Emperoure her
fader to the fontayne where Roberte was wonte to arme and vnarme hym and there she toke out the spere heed from bytwene the two stones where Ro¦berte had hydde it / and than she caused the spere to be brought forth where of this heed was broken / whiche was lyghtly broughte to her and that heed & the spere Ioyned togyder in one as cloes as they had not be broken / than sayd the mayde to the pope we haue had thre tymes vyctorye by his noble va∣lyaunce ayenst the myscreaunt Sarasyns / for I ha¦ue thre tymes sene his hors and harnays wherwith he hath thre tymes armed and vnarmed hym / but I can not tell who brought hym that hors and har¦nays nor vnto whome he delyuered it / but I knowe well that whanke hadde done he layde hym selfe downe by the dogges / and the mayden sayd vnto the Emperour her fader in this wyse / this is he that hath saued your londes and your honoure and ga∣te you vyctorye of the hethen hoūdes the Sarasyns wherfore ye ought of deute to rewarde hym / and yf it please you we wyll go all to hym and speke with hym / than wente they for the pope the Emperour and the doughter with all the Lordes and Ladyes vnto Roberte whome they founde lyenge amonge dogges they folowed hym and dyde hym reuerence but Roberte answered them not. ¶ How the heremyte foūde Roberte and commaū¦ded hym to speke saynge to hym that his penaunce was full done and his synnes forgyuen.
woodcut hermit and man THe Emperoure spake to Roberte & sayd I praye you swete frende come to me & shewe me youre thyghe for I wyll nedes se / whan Roberte herde thēperour saye these wordes he wyst well ynoughe wherfore he was comen to hȳ / but he lete hȳ as thoughe he had not vnderstonden hym & Roberte dyde many madde conceytes to make the pope & themperour to laughe & forgate yt they spo∣ke of / but the pope spake to Roberte & cōiured hym in ye name of god yt on the crosse dyed for our redem¦cyon that yf it be goddes wyll yt thou hast spoken yt thou speke now vnto vs / and than Roberte rose vp
tyke a toie and gaue the pope his blessȳge and here withall Roberte loked behynde hym & sawe the he¦remyte that set hym his penaūce & as soone as the heremyte se Roberte whiche he had longe sought he cryed to hym wt a loude voyce yt euery man myght here hȳ that were there my frende harken vnto me I knowe well that ye be Roberte that men calle the deuyll but now ye be in grace and conceyte with al¦myghty god and for that foule and hydeous name ye shall haue a fayre name & be called the seruaunt of god ye be he that hath saued this londe from the Sarasyns / wherfore I praye you that ye serue and worshyp god as ye haue done hyder to / for our lorde sendeth me now to you cōmaundynge you to speke and no more to conterfeyte the fole / for it is goddes wyll & cōmaūdement / for he hath forgyuen you all your synnes for bycause ye haue made satysfaccion & ful done your penaūce / whan Roberte herde this he fell lyghtly on his knees & lyfte vp his hondes towarde heuen saynge thus. I gyue lande & than∣kes to god creature of heuen & erth yt it hath plea∣sed the to forgyue me myne abhomynable & grete synnes thrughe so lytell & lyght penaunce yt I haue done therfore / whan the pope the Emperour & the doughter & all yt were there presente herde Roberte speke thus swetely they were all here of gretely en∣ioyed & had grete meruayll here of / themperour se∣ynge his noble valyaunce vertue & curtesye that in hym was & wolde haue gyuen hym his doughter to wyf / but ye heremyte wolde not it sholde be so / wher¦fore euery man departed and wente home.
¶ Howe Roberte tourned agayne to Rome for to marye the Emperours doughter by the commaun¦dement and wyll of god. NOw the storye telleth as after that Roberte had remyssyon of his synnes & was gone to¦warde his countre / than out of Rome god cōmaun¦ded hym thre tymes by an aungell that he sholde tourne agayne to Rome and to marye the Empe∣rours doughter whiche loued hym passyngly well and he sholde haue by her a sone wherby the crysten byleue sholde be encreased and forte fyed and defen¦ded Roberte at the cōmaundement of god tourned agayne to Rome and maryed themperours dough¦ter with grete tryumphe & solace / for themperour & all the Romayns were therof very gladde / this bry¦dale was royally kepte and euery man that se Ro∣berte loued and lyked hym aboue all other / and the people sayd one to an other that they were gretely beholdynge to Roberte that he had redemed them from theyr mortall enmyes the sarasyns this feest was grete and notable and deured .xiiii. dayes and whan the feest and brydale was done Roberte wol¦de departe with his lady in to Normandye to vysy¦te his fader and moder / and toke his leue of them∣perour whiche gaue hym many royall and greate gyftes as gold & syluer & precyous stones of dyuers colours / also themperour gaue hym knyghtes and squyers to ryde & conduyte hym in to his coūtre. ¶ How Roberte & his lady came to rowane in Nor¦mandye with grete honour and worshyp.
ROberte & his lady rode so ferre tyll they ca∣me in to Normandye in to the noble Cyte of rowane with grete myrth & solace / where they were receyued with greate tryumphe for the comyntees of the countre were sorye and in grete heuynes that theyr duke. Robertes fader was dyscesed forbycau¦se yt he was a wyse and a renomed prynce. A lytell besyde Rowane dwelled a cursed knyghte whiche had done the duchesse grete wronge and suppressed many knyghtes after her husbondes dyscease. But whan Roberte was comen euery man drad hym & dyde hym grete reuerence and worshyp / than some sayd we wende he had ben deed and all the lordes and burgeys of Rowane gadred them togyder and with greate honoure and reuerence they receyued Roberte and helde hym as theyr lorde and soueray¦ne. And whan they had receyued hym honourably they shewed hym of this before sayd knyghte / he had many tymes suppresse & done wronge to his moder sythen the deth of his fader / than whan ro¦berte herde & vnderstode this he sente lyghtly men of armes to take the sayd knyght / the whiche dy∣den so moche that they toke hym / and brought hȳ to Roberte whiche made hym to be hanged wher∣fore the duches was ryght gladde / but she was mo¦che more gladder that Roberte her sone was come home for she wende he had ben deed / & whan rober¦te and his moder were thus togyder / he recounted vnto her howe the Emperoure hadde gyuen hym his doughter in maryage / and how he hadde done his penaunce / the duchesse herynge her sones wor∣des
she began to wepe very sore / for bycause he had suffred so grete pouerte and penaunce / thoroughe his defaute. ¶ How the Emperour sente a messanger vnto the duke Roberte that he sholde come and rescue hym ayenst the Seneshall. IN the meane season whyles Robert was thus at Rowane with his moder and his ladye in grete Ioye and solace / there came a messanger fro the Emperour vnto Roberte / whiche dyde hym re¦uerence and saynge thus vnto hym / my lorde duke the Emperour hath sente me hyther to you and he prayeth you for to come and rescue hym ayenst the false traytoure the Seneshall wt the sarasyns whi∣che haue layde syege to Rome / whan Roberte her∣de these wordes he was sorye in his mynde for them¦perour / and shortly assembled as many men of ar¦mes as he coude gete in his londe of Normandy / & forth withall rode with them towarde Rome to hel¦pe and socoure the Emperoure / but before he cou∣de come thyder the false traytour the Seneshal had slayne the Emperour / whiche was grete pyte / but Roberte wente streyght in to Rome / & lyghtly with all his power and myght wente ayenst the Sene∣shall. And whan Roberte aspyed the false traytour he descryed hȳ saynge thus / abyde thou false tray∣toure / now thou shalte neuer escape my hondes yf thou abyde me in the felde / for thou arte now nygh thy lyues ende / thou dydest put ones a spere heed in thy thyghe for to haue deceyued ye Romayns / defen¦de
now thy lyfe ayenst me for thou shalte neuer esca¦pe myn hondes / and thou hast also slayne my lorde the Emperour / wherfore thou shalte be well rewar¦ded after that thou haste deserued. And with these wordes Roberte with a greate desyre / and myghty courage rode in contynent vnto the Seneshall and gaue hym suche a stroke on the helmette that he clo¦ue helmet and heed vnto the teeth / and in contynent the traytour fell downe deed vnto the erth / and Ro¦berte made hym to be brought in to Rome to the en¦tente that he sholde there be slayne to reuenge the ro¦maynes / the whiche was done in the presence of all the people that were in Rome / and in this wyse fy∣nysshed that traytoure the Seneshall his lyfe and had a shamfull deth / wherby men maye make and take hede that it is greate folye to coueyte or desyre thynges passynge theyr degre / for & the Seneshall had not desyred the Emperours doughter the whi¦che passed and exceded ferre aboue his degre / he had not dyed this shamful deth / but myght haue lyued and the Emperour also / & haue dyed good frendes. ¶ How yt the duke Roberte tourned agayne to Ro¦wane after he had made the Seneshal to be slayne. ROberte the duke defended the cyte of Rome from theyr enemyes. And than he tourned agayne with all his companye vnto Rowane to his wyfe whiche was passynge sorowfull and pensyfe But whan she herde yt the traytoure the Seneshall hadde slayne her fader / she was almoost out of her mynde. But Robertes moder comforted her in the
best maner that she coude or myght. And for to ma¦ke shortly an ende of our matre & so to fynysshe this booke we wyll lette passe to wryte of the grete dole and sorowe of the yonge duchesse / and speke of the duke Roberte whiche in his youth was abte to all myschefe and vyce and all vngracyousnes without ony measure or reason for he was a more deuourer and a more vengeable than ony lyon nothynge spa¦rynge / nor on no man hauȳge mercy nor pyte. And after this he lyued .vii. yere in grete penaunce lyke a wylde man without ony speche and lyke a dumbe beest etynge and drynkynge with dogges and the∣re after was he exalted and honoured of them whi¦che before dyde holde hȳ for a fole or an innocente and mocked with hym. This Roberte lyued longe in vertue and honoure with that noble lady his wyfe / and he was beloued and dradde of hygh and lowe degre / for he dyde ryght and Iustyce / as well ouer the ryche as ouer the poore kepynge his londe in reste and in peace / and he begotte a chylde with her / the whiche he called Rycharde / whiche dyde afterwarde many noble actes and dedes of armes with grete Charlemayne kynge of fraunce / for he dyde helpe hym for to gete and fortefye the crysten fayth and he made alwayes grete warre vpon the Sarasyns. And he lyued in his londe in reste & pea¦ce / and was beloued of poore and ryche / and all his comente loued hym / in lyke wyse as Roberte his fa¦der was beloued / for they lyued both deuoutly and in vertue / wherfore I praye god that we may so ly∣ue in this lyfe / that after this lyfe we may optayne
and come to euerlastynge lyfe. To the whiche bryn¦ge vs he / that bought vs and all mankynde / with his precyous blode & bytter passyon. Amen. Thus endeth the lyfe of Robert the deuyll. That was the seruaunt of our lorde And of his condycyons that was full euyll.
