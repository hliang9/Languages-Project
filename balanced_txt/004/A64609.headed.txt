London, Printed for Richard Baddeley, and are to be sold at his Shop, within the Middle-Temple-gate, 1652.
To the READER. SOme few months af∣ter that amongst o∣ther Papers of the Author's of very great concernment and know∣ledge, which were totally lost in the Pillage ensuing the fatal Blowe given to the Royal par∣ty
at Worcester, This ancient Pedigree, from amongst the re∣gardless fingers of the promis∣cuous Souldiery, was, by a sur∣passing honest and civil Officer of Colonel Pride's Regiment, most opportunely rescued from te inexorable rage of Vulcan, to whom by a file of Musquet∣tiers it was consecrated, to af∣ford smoak to their pipes of Tobacco; it falling by meer chance into my hands, and after perusal perceiving it to be exceeding useful and ingeni∣ous, I thought my self, in du∣ty to the Publike, obliged (lest at any time hereafter it should
incur the like hazard of imbe∣zelling) faithfully to commit it to the Press. Which de∣signe I the rather undertook, that the Author, whose Gene∣alogie it is, hath▪ already been highly esteemed of for his lite∣rature and other qualificati∣ons; whereof by Treatises long ago evlged, and actions of more then ordinary vertue, he hah at several occasions gi∣ven many ample testimonies. And albeit the condition wherein for the present he stands with the State▪ in mat∣ter of his charge and deport∣ment in the Regal Army, ap∣pear
not, in the judgements of those have taken his examinati∣on, to be (as I am informed) so desperate, as that he thereby will be much endangered: yet, leaving these mysteries to whom they are competent, and medling with no more then what by a common obligation to learning, and excellent en∣dowments of the interior fa∣culties, where ever they be found, I am tyed unto; I will onely make bold to speak a word or two in behalf of the Author, and in all humility submit the censure thereof to the judicious construction of
the State, whose prisoner he is. It being here every way per∣ceptible, by the Chronologie of his house, in this little tra∣ctate so punctually deduced, that providence hath been so favourable to that his family, as to preserve it amidst the many various revolutions, and almost innumerable changes of Mo∣narchies and Estates, wherein it was in several nations very often interessed: it is humbly desired, and (as I believe) from the hearts of all that are acquainted with him, that the greatest State in the world, stain not their glory by being
the Atropos to cut the thred of that which Saturnes sithe hath not been able to mow in the progress of all former ages, especially in the person of him, whose inward abilities are like to produce effects, conducible to the State, of as long continu∣ance for the future. And al∣though (as Christians) we be not obliged to assert the truth of that Philosophical position, whereby the future is always maintained to be for duration equal with what is past: yet would his minde (by all proba∣bility) if cherished with en∣couragements, emit for utility,
pleasure, and honesty, such fruits f goodness, as might reach the ne ad post, with no less extent of space, then ab ante, fortune ath conveyed the other; so hat to make use of Aristotles ther division of good, taken from its threefold variety of ubject, to which it oweth its nexistence: the Authors minde nd fortune will conjunctly (by appearance) be able to dilate hemselves over the whole ourse of time, provided his bo∣dy, now in the custody of the tate, may (of their Grace) eceive that inlargement, toge∣ther with other favours there∣unto
concomitant, the wan whereof would quite dash, an utterly overthrow the other two aforesaid Branches of tha Trichotomie in his person, to the great prejudice of th Commonwealth; which truly considering, how formerly h hath been a Mecaenas to th Scholar, a Patron to the Soul∣dier, a favourer of the Mar∣chant, a protecter of the Arti∣ficer, and upholder of th Yeoman; it were a thousan pities, that by the austerity o a State which dependeth in bot its esse, and bene esse, upon the flourishing of these worth
Professions, effects so advanta∣ous thereto, should by not ferring deserved courtesies  him, be extinguished in the ry brood. This, out of my ty to the State, and affection  the Author, I have thought  to premise, as it becomes the eaders well wisher G. P.
Praenoscendum. THe Figures in the rows above  Proper Names, are to be unders thus: The first denotes the yee the world, wherein such a one was b to which effect, at the top of the page,  above that figure are set down the let A. M. designing Anno Mund. The ∣cond shews their number, or Series, in ∣der from their first fore father, and to  effect the word Series is placed abov a the upper end of the Page. The th signifies the difference of yeers betw any two predecessors, as they follow  another; for which cause the  Common difference is posited abov at the beginning of the Page; it b
termed common difference for no other rea∣son, but that by adding, and abstracting it from the Epochs of the world, and incar∣nation, in the nativities of any one of the List, it will afford the true foresaid Epochs, in the birth of his successor. Lastly, the fourth number expresseth the Epoch of Christ, either before, or after the incarnation; and to this purpose are su∣praposited the words Ante Chr. Anno Christi. As for example, Esormon, was born in the yeer of the world, 1810, was the sixteenth from Adam, he was 32 yeers younger then his father Pasiteles, and lived 2139 yeers before the incarna∣tion, &c.

Egypt into Portugal, and of whom are de∣scended the Clanmolinespick in Ireland. His wife Panthea was the daughter of Deucalion and Pirra, of whom Ovid maketh mention in the first of his Metamorphosis. In that part of Africk which after his name is till this hour called Molinea, by cunning and valour toge∣ther he killed in one morning three Lions, the heads whereof, when in a basket presented to his Lady Panthea, so terrified her, that (being quick with childe) for putting her right hand to her left side, with this sudden exclamation, [O Hercules, what is this!] the impression of three Lions heads was found upon the left side of the childe as soon as he was born. How Portugal was so called, after Gathelus; the Scots, after Scota; and that the Scotobrigants were the race of Molin in Spain, is clearly set down in the ample story of the House. Mo∣lin on Panthea begot EPITIMON. An. mun. Series. Com. difference. Ante Christ. 2446 41 31 1503 Epitimon maried Gonima. This Gonima was the sister of Hiber (after whom Ireland was called Hibernia) and
daughter of Gathelus, begotten on Scota; in honour of whom, Epitimon (she being his mo∣ther-in-law) after her name, called his second son Scotus; of whose progenie, shortly after, the surname of Scot▪ took its beginning, toge∣ther with the Arms which Molin  by his valour had acquired on the coast of Africk, and which upon the left side of Epi∣timon by nature were imprinted from his mo∣thers womb, as hath already been sufficiently enough glanced at in the description of Mo∣lin. Then began the old Arms of Urquhart in the house of Esormon (viz. three Banners, three Ships, and three Ladies) to be exchanged into three Lions heads. Epitimon on Goni∣wa begot HYPOTYPHOS. An. mun.

Com. difference Ante Christ. 2627 49 29 1322 Cainotomos maried Thymelica. Here is onely set down the difference be∣tween the ages of Syngenes and Cainotomos, which is 29; and not that of Polyphrades to either of them, as hath been formerly observed in Aglaestos, Magalonus, and Evemros; because Polyphrades, though psterior in suc∣cession, is elder in yeers; and therefore to re∣gard his difference, would but intangle the progress of our Chronological Genealogie.
This Cainotomos took to wife Thymelica the daughter of Bacohus, in recompence of his having accompanyed him in the conquest of the Indies. Cainotomos in his return from thence into Greece, passed through the territo∣ries of Israel, where being acquainted with Debora the Judge and Prophetess, he received from her a very rich Jewel, which afterwards by one of his succession was presented to Pen∣tasilea, that Queen of the Amozons that assist∣ed the Trojans against Agamemnon. On his wife Thymelica he begot RODRIGO. An. mun. Series. Com. difference Ante Christ. 2656 50 29 1295 Rodrigo maried Ephamilla.

This Beltistos was agnamed Chonchar, for which cause, a certain progeny descended of him, is till this hour called the generation of the Ochonchars; a race truly of great antiquity and renown in the dominion of Ireland.

This Vocompos, for his valour and gallan∣try in the field, was by King Solvatius resto∣red to that part of his Land which is called the shire of Cromartie, together with other parcels of his old inheritance in the Counties of Bu∣chan and Ross, and invested him with more priviledges and immunities, to be derived to his posterity, then he had done to any other sub∣ject in that dominion, in compensation (as it were) of thrice as many moe Lands, which Eugenius Octavus, father to the said Solva∣tius, had taken from his Grandfather Zeron,
An. mun. Series. Com. difference. Anno Christ. 4720 123 3 775 and which the said Solvatius was unwilling to cause restore to Vocompos. He had to his second brother, one named Phorbas Urqu∣hart, and Hugh to the third; of whom some few hundreds of yeers after that, the names of Forbes and Macky had their beginning. What Holinshed out of Hector Boce relates of the origine of the name of Forbes, is spoken at random, without other ground then the meer ambition of the said Boece, for the honour of his own name. That Forbes (by true Or∣thographie , of which name there was a King of Athens, and several second brothers of the predecessors of this family, of whom, some mention is made in the Chronological legend thereof, it being a name in Greece as commonly made use of, as , or such like) should of a name, which then it was, become afterwards a surname to the successors of Phorbas the se∣cond brother of Vocompos, occurred meer∣ly by reason of the Aphaeretical and Apocopal curtaling of the Syllables, Mack▪ ap▪ and son, for the quicker and more expedite deliverie in the expression of those, that, without regard
An. mun. Series. Com. difference. Anno Christ. 4720 123 3 775 of surnames, were pleased to designe men by their patrymical tides: by means of which scurvy custom; too much cheished, as yet, in many parts of both Scotland and Wales, the Forbeses since they began to have two several Lords of that name besides many other very especial Knights and Gentlemen of good estates and fortunes) becoming almost forgetful of the stock from whence they descended, would se up a Genarchie by themselves, although, by the ordinary rules of Heraldry, their very Arms do sufficiently declare their cadency. Nor need we think strange, why they are cal∣led Phorbas, or Forbes, and not Mack. Phor∣bas, Ap. Phorbas, or Phorbasson; because, for the reason before deduced, not onely it, but likewise very many other more vulgar names, such as George, Henry, Alexander, An∣drew, Wat, Tom, Gib, Dick, Peter, Iames, &c. pass for surnames, over the whole Isle of Britain, in the mouths of all; of whom not any, for the proper and peculiar designation, of several thousands of its inhabitants, is able to afford any other cognominal deno∣mination. Vocompos was the first in the
world that had the Bears heads to his Arms being induced to exchange, by the instiga∣tion King of Solvatius, his Armes of thre Lyons heads, for the three Bears heads razed because of the great exploit, in presence of the King, done by him and his two foresaid bro∣thers, in killing one morning three wild Bears, in the Caledonian Forrest: the supporters were also changed into two Grey-hounds, th Crest and Impresa remaining still the same a it was since the days of Astioremon.

SUBDICTIS. BY the chief of the Family, Sir Thomas Urquhart by name, the History of the lives of all these his predecessors is already broached, he making account to finish it how soon the amicable influence of the State (in dependance whereupon his fortune is involved) will, by acquit∣ting him of his Parole (wherein to them he stands ingaged) be pleased to release him, and in giving him full enjoyment of his own, allow him the leisure to go about it, and o∣ther things of greater importance. The History being continued from the Creation of the world, till this
present time, will contain many spe∣cious Synchronisms, worthy of re∣mark, and as it comprehendeth all the time thatis past, so shall few acti∣ons of moment, or persons of either sexe, that have been illustrious for any commendable quality, escape the tract of that his Pen, which treats of their contemporaneans.
POSTILLA. IN the great Chronicle of the house of Urquhart, the aforesaid Sir Thomas purposeth (by Gods assistance) to make ention of the illustrious families from ence descended, which as yet are in e∣eem in the Countries of Germany, Bo∣mia, Italy, France, Spain, England, Scot∣land, Ireland, and several other Nations of warmer climate, adjacent to that fa∣mous territory of Greece, the lovely mo∣er of this most ancient and honourable em. How by the iniquity of time, and con∣sion of languages, their Names have en varied, their coat Armour altered, d as new sians transplanted unto another
soil, without any reference almost to th stock from whence they sprung. And how many Towns, Castles, Church∣es, Fountains, Rivers, Nasses, Bays, Har∣bours, and such like, have from the name  Urquhart received their denomination. He likewise intendeth to omit the nomi∣nating of no family wherewith at any tim the foresaid house hath contracted allianc which for more compendiousness hath i the contexture of this epitomie been of  purpose left out. As also to set down the Branches of th foresaid Name in order as they sprung from the root, together with their alliances, ex∣ploits, and other notorie things; delecta∣ble even to those that have no interest i the family.
