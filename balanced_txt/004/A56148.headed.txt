A CATALOGVE OF SVCH TESTI∣MONIES IN ALL AGES AS PLAINLY EVIDENCE BISHOPS AND PRESBYTERS TO BE BOTH ONE, EQUALL AND THE SAME IN IURISDICTION, Office, Dignity, Order, and degree, by divine Law and instituti∣on, and their disparity to be a meere humane ordinance long after the Apostles times; And that the name of a Bishop is onely a Title of Ministration, not Dominion, of La∣bour not of Honour, of Humility, not of Prelacy, of painfullnesse not of Lordlinesse, with a Briefe Answer to the Objections out of Antiquity, that seeme to the contrary. Printed in the Yeere. 1641.
The EPISTLE to the READER. Christian Reader, THere is nothing more frquent in the mouthes of our Lording Prelates and their Flatterers, then to vaunt, That their Hierarchie and Episco∣pall Speriority over other Ministers is by divine Right and Institution; and that all Antiquity from Christs till Calvins dayes, and all learned men, ex∣cept a despicable small number of Factious Puri∣tans (as they term them) suffragate to this Conclusion. This was the more then thrasonicall bast of Dr. Lad, Arch-prelate of Canterbury, and some others, not onely at the Censure of Dr. Layton in the Star-chamber, and Dr. Bastwicke in the High-Commission some few yeares past; but likewise at the late Censure of Dr. Bastwicke, Mr. Burton, and Mr. Prynne in the Star-chamber, Iune 14. 1637. where, in his learned Speech (since Printed by speciall command, through his own underhand procure∣ment) he thus magisterially determines, pag. 6, 7. This I will say (he might have done well to have proved it first, but that his Ipse dixit only is now an Oacle) and abide by it, That the calling of Bishops (to wit Archbishops and Docaesans, superiour to, and distinct from Presy∣ters, else his Speech is not onely idle but impertinent) is Iure divino: though not all adjuncts to their cal∣lings: (he should have done well to have specifie what adjuncts in particular) And I say further, that from the Apostles times in all ages, in all places the Church of Christ was governed by Bishops (to wit
Diocaesan Bishops like to our Prelates now, which he will prove at Graecas Calendas.) And Lay-Elders never heard of, till Calvins new-fangled devise at Ge∣neva. To disprove which fabulous assertion, I have not only particularly encountred it, in the Unbishoping of Timothy and Titus, to which no Answere yet hath been returned by this Over-confident Boaster, or his Champi∣ons, though specially challenged to Answer it) but likewise by way ef Supplement to that Treaise, drawn up this ensu∣ing Catalogue (which I challenge his Arch-grace, with his brother Prelates, Doctors, Proctors, Parasites to en¦counter with as many contrary Authorities if they can;) wherby both learned and illiterate may with ease discern, that both by divine Institution, the suffrages of Fathers, Councels, forraigne and domestick writers of all sorts aswell Papists as Protestants, and the resolution of the Church and State of England in Convocation and Par∣liament, Bishops and Presbyters are but one and the sam in point of Office and Iurisdiction; and that the Superiority of Bishops over other Ministers is a meer humane Institution long after the Apostles dayes, introduced, partly by custome, partly by the Bishops owne insensible incroachmets upon their fellow brethren; but principally by the grants, con∣nivances, or indowments of Christian Princes, destitute of any divine foundation to support it. I confesse, in the Histoy of the Councel of Trent: Edit, 3. p. 589, 590, 591. to 16. Councel of Trent, it was much de∣bated among the Popish Prelates and Divines there pre∣sent; Whether Bishops were by divine Ordination, Superiour to Priests? But the Councel being divided in opinion, left the Controversie undetermined. Those Bishops and Divines who held the affirmative, pro∣duced nothing out of Scripture, or solid Antiquity to justifie their opinions, worthy answere, but that Aerius
was deemed an Heretick for affirming the contrary (which I have ere disproved:) ye Idid. p. 59 See Mi de Sacra. Horm. Origine et Cont. l. 1. c. 5. Michael of Medina who alleageth this of Aerius, was so ingenious to confsse, that Hierome, Austin, and some others of the Fathers (as Ambrose, Sedulius, Primasius, Chry∣sostomus, Theodoret, Oecumenius) did fall into Aërius heresie in this point, it being no wonder that they did so, because the matter was not cleare in all points. This his boldnesse, to say that Hierome and Austin did savour of Haeresie, gave great scan∣dall: but h insisted the more upon it: The Doctors saith the History) were equally divided into two opinions in this point. And when this Ibid. p. 589. Article was propounded in this Romish Councel; That the Bi∣shops are instituted by Christ, and are Superiour to Priests de Iure divino; The Legates with others answered, that the Lutherans and Heretiques hav∣ing affirmed, that a Bishop and a Priest is the sam thing (Ib. 591.60.606. putting no difference between a Bishop & a Priest, but by humane constitution; and affirming, that the Superiority of Bishops was first by custom, and afterwards by Ecclesiasticall constitution, for which they cie the Augustane Confession made by the German Churches;) it was fit to declare, that a Bishop is Superiour, but that it was not necessary to say qu jure, nor by whom a Bishop is instituted From whence it appeares clearly; That halfe or more of these Trent Fathers, with all the Lutherans and Protestant Churches at that time were cleare of opinion; That Prelates Epis∣copacy is not Iure divino: and those who peruse that History and De Clericis. l. 1. c. 14. Bllarmine may at irst discerne, that all our Prelates arguments and Authorities now produced to maintaine their Episcopall Iurisdiction to be divine, are taken verbatim from these Popish Fathers of Trent
who maintain their assertion, and Bellarmine de Cleri∣cis the stoutest Champion for their cause. Alas! to what miserable Shifts are our Prelates driven, when they must thus fly to Trent, to Bellarmine for ayd to support their tottering Thrones! And yet these will stand them in no stead, all the Trent Prelates confessing with S. Hierom. History of the Councel of Trent: p. 220. That in the first beginnings of Christianity, the Churches were governed by a kind of Aristocracy, by the common Councel of the Presbytery, and that the Monarchicall government and Superiori∣ty of Bishops and Archbishops crept in by custome, as the Pag. 220.330. to 335. an excellent consi∣derable place. History of the Councel of Trent relates at large; where you may read the originall of their Courts and Iurisdictions, with the steps and meanes of their ex∣orbitant growth and encroachments upon the temporall Iurisdiction and Prerogative of Princes, well worthy the greatest Statesmens consideration. Besides, Dionysius Cathusianus, and Cardinal Contarenus in their Com∣mentaries on Phil. 1.1. confesse, that in Pauls time, Bishops and Presbyters were both one, and that ei∣ther Order was conferred on the Presbyter. That Presbyters are there meant by Bishops, whence it is usually said, That in the Primitive times Bishops were not distinguished from Priests. Azorisus the Iesuite Moral. part. 2. l. 3. c. 16. confesseth, that in the Apostles times, every where, those who were or∣dained Elders in Cities were Bishops: Cardinal Cusanus. De Concordia Cathol. l. 2. c. 13. writes the same in effct: All Bishops; and perchance also Presbyters are of equall power, as to Jurisdiction, although not of execution; which executive exercise is restrai∣ned by certaine positive Laws (not Divine but Cano∣nicall) whence the cause of these Laws ceasing,Glossa, De∣cret. Distinct. 93 c. Legimu. the Laws themselvs determine. And Johannes Seme∣ca
a Popish Canonist, avers; That in the first primitive Church the Office of Priests and Bishops was the same: but in the second primitive Church, (to wit, some space after the Apostles times) both their names and Offices began to be distinguished. The same Doctrine, together with the Identity and Pa∣rity of Bishops and Presbyters is professedly averred, not only by those hereafter cited in the Catalogue; but also by In Iohn Cres∣pin. L'estate de Leglise f. 254. Huldrick Bishop of Ausburg, about the year of Christ 860. in his Epistle to Pope Nicholas, in defence of Priests Marriage: by John Crespin.

Yea, Both cite y Bishop Vser, d Bittanicarum Eccles. primo diis, p. 800. Iohn Major de Gestis Scotorum: l. 2. c. 3. wites, that in anci∣ent times the Scots were instructed in the Christian faith, by Priests and Monks, and were then without Bishops. And Iohn Fordon Scotichronicon. l. 3. c. 8. before him, records, That before the coming of Pal∣ladius, the Scots had only Presbyters or Monks to instruct them in the Faith and administer the Sa∣craments, following the custome of the primitive Church. And Henric  man,  Tom. 1 p. 31 from Palladius dayes till the reigne of Malcolm the 3d; the Bishops of Scotland had no Diocesse at all (and so were no Diocesan Prelates) but every Bishop whom holinesse had made reverend in that age, exercised his Episcopall function without distinction in every place he came. If then Bishops
and Presbyters were all one and the same in the first Pri∣mitive Church, which Churh, ogether with that of Scot∣land, was anciently governed only by Presbyters, not by any Lordly Prelaes, or Diocesan Bishops (which Dr. William Fulke in his Answer of a true Christi∣an, &c. p. 20.50. professeth o be Antichristian, Paall and no divine institution,) why the Churches of Scot∣land, and England may not now be governed by Presby∣ters only without Bishops, aswell as at first, I canno con∣ceive their regiment of late having been so tyrannicall, unchristian, antichristian and exorbitant, that they have almost wholly ruined our Religion, Church, State, and lef them in a most perplexed, if not desperate condition; which proves their Hierarchy to be rather Antichristian and Diabolicall, then Divine. And how can it be otherwise, if we rightly consider the Persons or Condition of our Hierarchy and their Anti∣christian Attendants? I remember a merry Sory in Itinear, l. 2. c 13. Giraldus Cambrensis, and out of him related by Mr. Camden in his Britannia: p. 604. It hapned that a cer∣taine Iew travelling towards Shrewsbury with the Archdeacon of Malpas (in Ches-shire) whose sur∣name was Peche, that is, Sinne, and a Deane named Devill; when he heard by chance the Archdeacon telling, that his Archdeaconry began at a place called Ill-street, and reached as farre as to Malpas towards Chester; he considering ad understanding withall aswell the Arch-deacons Surname as the Deans, came out with this merry and pleasant con∣ceit; Would it not be a wonder (quoth he) and my fortune very good, if ever I get safe againe out of this Countrey, where Sinne is the Arch-deacon, and the Devill is the Dean; where the entry into the Archdeaconry is Illstreet, and the going forth
of it Malpas? It was Fratres sic fa∣cit Iesus hdi, multos sii eli∣ge Diaolos Episcpo. In Gone. Rhe∣mensi Simo. St. Bernards complaint in his age, that Iesus Christ elected many Devils to be Bi∣shops, as he chose Iudas to be an Apostle. Since then there be so many Archbishops, Deanes, and Bishops, De∣vills, so many Archdeacons Sinners, if not Sinne; and the entrance into these Offices (by reason of Symony, Am∣bition, and th like) a meer Illstreet, and their going forth of them (by reason of their wicked lives, and exorbitant actions occsioned by their very Office) Malpas, it is al∣most a wonder, and very good fortune, if any onest godly Minister or Professor ever get safe againe out of their Courts and Diocesse, or escape drowning in their Seas. Hence is it, that the devoutest men in all ages since Prelates became Lords paramount to Ministers, have either utterly refused to accept of Bishpricks, or resigned them after acceptance; as I have In the Epistl Dedicaoy be∣foe the Vnbi∣shoping of Ti∣mothy and Titus. elswhere manifested by sundry examples, and shall here furher exemplifie by ther evidences. Les Flwrs de vies des Socts: part 1. Parisiis: 1637. p. 500. Ribadenerra a Iesuite, records it to the great praise of Bernardine of Sennes, canonized at Rome for a Saint; that out of his humility he re∣fused the 3. Bishopricks of Sennes, Ferrara, and Vr∣ban, which severall Popes offred to him: and though one Pope put a Bishops Mier on his head with his own hands, yet he put it off againe, humbly beseech∣ing him not to impose the charge of any Bishoprick upon him, and to change that estate of Poverty to which God had called him; because he should bring more advantage to the Church by preaching the Word of God, and ayding the Soules of many Bi∣shopricks, then by being a Bishop in one Church: The Pope hearing his reasons confessed them true, and left him to his own liberty. Ribadener∣ra Ibid. p. 38. Vincent Ferrier another Popish Saint, is highly magnified, for that' being urged by the Pope to accept the Bishopricke
of Leride, the Archbishopricke of Valence, and a Cardinalship; it was impossible to move him to ac∣cept of any of these charges; deeming it a greater advantage to free one Soule from the chaines of Sinne, then to gain all the great preferments of the world. For he perceived that these honourable dignities seemed like so many golden chaines, whereby he should be detained at the Court, and deprived of liberty to goe and preach the Gospell with poverty, as God had commanded him. So Tho∣mas of Idem Ibidem, p. 313. Aquin, canonised for a Saint, is highly ap∣plauded for refusing the Archbishopricke of Na∣ples, with other great dignities offered unto him by the Pope. In like sort Idem Ibidem, p. 303 304. Raimond of Rocheort, ano∣ther Roman Saint, is extolled, for refusing to accept the Archbishopricke of Arragon, which the Pope himselfe conferred upon him, and commanded him to accept within few dayes; at which news he was very sad, and most humbly and instantly intreated his Holinesse, not to lay such a burthen upon him, which he knew not how to beare: and seeing that the Pope was resolved to enforce him to accept it, he fell sicke with indignation, a ieuere continuing upon him till he died of regret, and so discharged him of this care. Idem Ibidem, p 358. Antoninus another ate Ro∣mish Saint, being elected Archbishop o Florence by Pope Eugenius the 4th, refused to accept thereof, because being retired out of the tempests of the world, he should therby return into hem to the great perill of his Salvation. The Pope hereupon commanded him by his Bull to accept it, threat∣ning else to excommunicate him: whereupon by the advise of his Covent and the Magistrates of Florence, who informed him, that he ought to obey
the Pope herein, he unwillingly accepted it; and kneeling down before them, he lift up his eyes and hands to heaven, saying; O my Lord thou knowest full well that it is much against my will to accept this charge; which I have undertaken for feare to resist thine and thy Vicars will: and since thou knowest it, I beseech thee direct me to doe what I ought. Then entring into his See, he had only 8. persons in his house; He had no Cupboord, Tapistry or hangings of Say in his Chamber; no vessels of Silver; no Horses nor Coaches, riding upo a Mule that was given him; saying, that the goods of the poore ought not to be spent in nourishing beasts, and providing Superfluities. He had the Scripture alwayes read at his Table: and ever said, they should doe him a speciall favour to thrust him from his Archbishopricke, wherein he continued with as great regret as he received it.

Richard Havering, Archbishop of Dublin, voluntarily re∣nounced his Archbishopricke upon this occasion One night he dreamed that a certaine Monster heavier then the whole world stood eminently a∣loft upon his brest, from the weight whereof he chose rather to be delivered, then alone to have all the goods of the world. When he wakened, he thought thus with himselfe, that this was nothing ls but the Church of Dublin, the fruits whereof he received, but took no paines for the same: (the case of most Prelates now:) as soon as he could therfore he came to the Pope, of whom he was much beloved, and there renounced and gave over the Archbi∣shopricke; for he had fatter and better livings then the Archbishopricke came unto. Why should not our Archbishops and Bishops now follow these many vertu∣ous examples, in resigning and abandoning all their Bi∣shopricks, for the setting of a sweet peace and blessed Har∣mony in our distracted Church and State, which their am∣bition, pride, tyranny, Exorbitances and Innovations have almost brought to ruine? Had they but their humi∣lity
and piety, they would speedily renounce their most pernicious Hierarchy, to imbrace a fraternall unity and parity with their fellow-brethren, whom Christ hath made their equals, as these and other Prelats have done; and as our present Relation of  Conerenc, p. 169 in the margin. Archbishop of Canterbury confesseth that famous Nazianzen, rather thn the peace should be broken, freely resigneth the great Patriarchate Constantinople, and retired: whose steps he should doe well to follow. But if he or they refuse to do it for our Churches peace, and Kingdomes safety, let them know that it is no new thing to abolish Bishopricks by Act of Parliam by which 31. H. 8. c 9.33 H. . c. 31.34.

Mr. Camden can at large informe us, almost halfe the Ancient Bishopricks there, being not now extant. The Bishopricke of West∣minster was no sooner erected almost, but instantly sup∣pressed; And 7.

necessary in regard of their presence in Parlia∣ments, which some conceive cannot be held with∣out the presence of these ord Spirituall. I Answer, first, that Abbots and Priors before the dissolution of Monateries were Spirituall Lords in Par∣liament aswell as Bishops: since then Parliaments both may, have been, and are now held without Lord Abbots ad riors, they may by the same reason be held without Lod Bishops. Second, Bshops sit nt in Parliament of right as they are Bshops (for as Bishops, they are not Cromptous Iu∣risdiction, , 12, b, Stamford Plee. dl Corone l, 3, c, 1, , 153, , 3, , 3, p, 161, 33, 1. .

If then the Parliament in these cases of highest naure may passe a compleat Iudgement without them, their presence is not necessary in it, nor they any needfull members of it. Fourhly, Bishops in former ages een under Popish Kings, when they had most sway, have been excluded Parliaments, much more then may they be so now: Fox Acts and Monument in the old Edition, p. 748. 901 905, 97 b 1706, b, i, 17, b, Gardner and Bonner in King Ed∣wards dayes; and all Bishops that were married (as most then were) in the first Parliament in Queen Ma∣ries reigne were excluded the Parliament; and in
King Edward the 1. his time at the Parliament held at S. Edmonds Bury, Anno 1296. all the Bishops were put out of the Parliament and Kings protection, and that Parliament held good and made Laws without them. And Anno 1273. in the 20. yeare of Henry the 3. the Statute of Merton cap. 9. toching Bastardy, was made by the Lords temporall and Commons without and against the consent of the Bishops. hse two Presidens are cited by Bishop Iewell in his Apology against So Crmtn quotes it. But it s in his defence of hi. Apology, at pat 6 c. 2 p. 5, i 522 Harding; f. 620. who there affirmes, that a Parliament may be held without any Bishops; to whch Cromptos Iu∣ridiction of Cous f 9 b. Mr. Crompton, and Bishop Bil∣son likewise assent: therfore I shall no lnger debate it, as being pas all doubt; concluding this point in Bishop Bilsons words (a great Champion for Episcopay) which are full and notable. Of the true dif∣eence between Chriian ubje∣ction and Anti∣christian ebel∣lion, pat 3, p, 541, 542, 543, Claime you (Bishops) that in∣terest and prerogative, that without you nothing shalbe done in matters of Religion, by the Laws of God, or by the liberties of this Realm. By the Laws of the Land, have no such priviledge. Parliaments have been kept by the King and his Barons, THE CLERGIE WHOLLY EXCLVDED. And when the Bishops were present, their voyces from the Conquest to this day were never negative. y Gods aw you have nothing to doe with making Laws for Kingdome, & Common-wealths: o may teach, you may not command: Prswasion is your part, compulsion is the Princes. I Princes imbrace the Truth, you must obey them; If they pursue Truth, you must abide them. By what Authority then claime you this dominion over Princes; that their Laws for Religion shalbe voyd, unlesse you consent? After which he proves at larg, that the Kings of Iudah and Israel of old, with many godly Christian
Kings and Emperours since, have made not only Civil, but cclesiasticall Laws without a Council, or any suf∣frage of Bishops: Much more then may they hold a Par∣liament without their presence; as Bishop Jewel proves at lange. It was a noable Speech and true of Ludovi∣cus Cardinall Arelatensis in the Councel of Basill;For Acts & Monuent Lond. 110 p 624 625 where he maintained the parity of Bishops and Pres∣byters: That rich and Lordly Bishops feare the power of the Prince, and to be spoyled of their temporalities, neither have they free liberty to speak as is required in Councels. Albeit if they were true Bishops and true Pastors of Soules, they would not doubt to put their lives in venture for their Sheep, nor be afraid to shd their blood for their Mother the Church. But at this present (the more is the pitty) it is too rare to find a Prelate in this world, which doth not prefer his temporalities be∣fore his Spiritualities, with the love whereof they are so withdrawn, that they study rather to please Princes then God; and confesse God in corners, but Princes they will openly confesse. Concluding hat the poor are more apt to give judgement then the rich, because their riches bringeth feare, and their poverty causeth liberty. For the poore feare not tyranny as rich men do, who being given over to all kind of vanities, idlenesse and sloth, will rather deny Christ then lacke their accustomed pleasures; Such are they whom not their flock but their reve∣nues make Bishops. Have ye not heard how they said, they would consent to the Kings will and plea∣sure? But the Inferiors are they which have had truth, righteousnesse and God himselfe before their eyes, and they are greatly to be commended for shewing themselves such men unto the Church of
God. If hen any desire the continuance of Lord Bishops in Church or Parliament, yet it wilbe necessary to strip them of their Temporalities and Lordships, and to con∣fine them to one living with Cure, where they may reside and preach like other Ministers, because their Tempora∣lities will make them Temporizers, and to vote amisse agnst God and the Republike both in Parliament and Convocation, as this Cardinall truly informs us from experience. To close up all in a few words. I shall desire  ordly Prelates and others to observe; that Rev. 4.4.10.11. c. 5, 6.11, 12.14. c. 7.11, 12, 13, 14 15. c. 11.15, 19, 17, 18. c. 19.4, 5, 6. The 24 Elders are placed next in rank to the very throne of Christ, as being next to him in Au∣thority and Iurisdiction, no Archbshops or Bishops ¦ing there named, much lesse interposed between them. That the Angels (whom our Prelates will needs interpret o be Diocesan Bishops in the 2d and 3d of the Revelation, though the Contents of our last ranslated Bibles expresly define them, to be the Ministers, not Bishops, of the 7 Churches) stand round about the Elders, and are re∣moters from Christs throne then they therfore not so honourable. That Christ standeth in the midst of the Elders; to signiie, that hey are subject to no Diocesan Bishop, but Christ alone, and hat no Lord Bishops, but Elders only belong to the Kingdome and Government of Christ, who is never said to be in the midst of Archbishop and Bishops (none of his institution) but of the 24. Elder only: That these Elders alone worship and prostrate themselves, give thanks, and resolve doubts upo all occasions not Bishops: And that when the King∣domes of this world, become the Kingdome of o Lord and his Christ, and when the Lord God om∣nipotent is said to raigne, the Elders are still said to be about Christs throne, and to adore and praise

Therfore our Prelates must needs confesse themselves to be but Elders only & properly; or else acknowldge, that Elders by divine nstitution are Superiour to them in dignity and that Archbishops and Bishops have no place at all appoin∣ted them by Christ about his throne, or withn his Church and Kingdome, and therfore must needs be Antichristian and inoerable in our reformed Church; out of which I doubt not re long to see them quite ejected, and Ma. .13.

As namely of Niclas Smih, in his modest and biefe discussion of certaine Assertions which are taught by Mr. Doctor lison in his Treatise of the cclesiasticall . where thus he determines, See C∣su a utatis Paien∣is  16.31. p. 16 21 24.2, 37 I judge is no rashnes to affirm that since England enjoyed a Bisp (to wit a Pos ishop to confirme the Papists, and controll the Piests, namely Richd bisop of Chlce∣d created the generall ishop and super∣intendnt, both of England and Scotland, by Pope Vrbaus speciall Bull, dated the 4th. of August, Anno 1625. The Coppy whereof you shall ind printed, in Cen∣sura Propositionm quaundam &c. per sa∣cram facultatem Theologa Parisinsis factae
Paisiis, 1631, p, 63, 64, 65: that more damage hath happened to the Catho∣likes in generall by reason of discord, and frequent losse of charity, then they have received benefit, by the Sacra∣ment of Conirmation onely conferred on some few. That all holy men have exceedingly edeavoured to sun such an high dig∣ity. That a Bishop is in a State which pre∣supposeth but yet gives not perfection: which the State of Religion, not onely presupposeth but giveth. That a vow not to receive a Bishop∣ricke is valid and sacred. That o desie a Bishopricke even for that which i best in it, to wit for the good of soules according to St: Thoms scunda suda, que 185. Art, 1, seemes to be presumptin, and there are some who stick not to say (and that common∣ly) it is a motall sinne. That these ropositions following are strange, idle, and absurd. That it is d iure divin, and that the law of God is, that every particular Church (as England is) ought to have a Bishop. That without a Bishop England were not a particular Church. That unlesse every particular Church hath its Bishop or Bishops, the whole and Vnivesall Church could not be) as Christ hath instituted it) an Hierarchie composed of divers particular Church∣es. That without a Bishop we cannot have conirmation &c. All which principles (saith hee) are worse then the concultion it selfe and demonstrated by us (to it in that Trea∣tise) to have no foundation at all. Thus this Popish Priest who proving that the Church of England may well sub∣sist without a Popish Bishop to sway and order it; grants that it may doe the like without our Protesant Prelates, and that plainly resolves that it is not from any divine law or institution, that the Church of England should have any Bishop at all to govern it. Daniell a Iesu another Priest, and a Reader of Divinity thus seconds him, in his Apologie for the proceeding of the holy see Apo¦stolike, as to the government of the ca∣tholickes in England during the time of Persecution Censrae Paisinsis p, 40, 48, 49, 60 That it is most false and of dangerous consequence, that a parti∣cular Church cannot be without a Bi∣shop: That Gods law requires no more, but that there be som Bishops in the Church to wit so many, that there bee no danger, that the whole Order should suddainly be taken away by their deaths and so dispersed through the world, that all Christians may bee sufficiently provided of learned and vertuous Priests. If this be done the law of God is sa∣tisfied although there be no Bishops in Fance, Spaine, or, England. Give me thereoe a mulitude of Christians how great soever who want not a Bishop to ordaine Priests, and I will boldly affirm that there is n need that the governour of that society should be a Biop. Yea let us suppose the Ordinaion o Priests and the Ministry of the Chuch, not to be necessary in the Church, and presently it followes, that there is no need the universall Church should bee governed by Bishops who are superior to Priests. That in the time of Persecution it is neither good, nor convenient, nor any solace or comfort to the Church to have a Bishop. That thoe who of Bishops are made Religious persons may be said in some sort to fly igher, and not at all to de∣scend. That if the Catholickes of England should yeeld to this motion (namey to receive the Bishop of Chalcedon as their poper Pastor and Bishp they could by no meanes excuse themselves from being worthy of that reprehension which the Crinthians received from Saint Paul, namely, that they rashly, and indiscreetly, put themselves into subjection that they should bestow their temporall goods, so as they could exspect no reward from God, as exer∣cising humility, Obedience, Patence, for which no crowne of Righteousnesse is prepared: yea that they may by their
blind receiving o him (though by the Popes owne Bull and authority) expose themselves to manifest perill by falling into mortall sinne &c. These Positions of theirs were pub∣likely taught and maintained by many other Priests both in England, and Ireland as appeares by the censure of the facul∣ty of Paris, and Nicholas I Maistre his Instauratio antiqui Principatus Episcoporum Parisijs 1633. Written upon this occa∣sion in answer of these Treatises and some others. Some of which Proposi∣tions though they were censured as E∣ronious, by the faculty of the Divine of Paris. Anno 1631. through the power of the Bishop of Chalcedon, as striking at the Popes Supremacy and the Bishops Hierarchie, yet in all that censue, I finde not one passage of Scripture produced to prove them contrary to the word of God, and therfore that censure of theirs not much to be regard. THE FOVRTH SQVADRON. THe 4th Squadron consists of For∣raigne Protestant Churches and writers, which I shall muster & ranke in order according to their an∣tiquities as neare as I may.

All which Acts and Patents judici∣ally condemne and overturn our Bishops pretended superiority, over their fellow Brethren by a divine right, the very claime whereof alone makes them all liable to a Premunire and meer perjur'd persons both to God and the King, bee∣ing directly contrary to the very oath of Supremacy, prescribed by 1 Eliz, c, 1, which every Bishop oft times takes, and every graduate and Clergie man whatsoever who must either abjure this pretended Ius Divinum with which they would support the Hierarchie, or prove: perjur'd disloyall Subjects to their So∣veraigne. Having thus presented you with this large Catalogue of Authorities proving the parity quality, and identity of Bi∣shops, and Presbiters by divine right and institution. I shall now challenge all our great swelling relates, and their satteres joyntly and severally (secially the two Arch-Bishops who have made so many throsonicall braggs of the proofe of their divine Title in open Court befoe thousands of people) to produce a con∣trary Catalogue of Authrities of thes severall kinds evidening thei divine pretended right, supeioity and juris∣diction over other Minises, f they are able to do it and to give a satisfactory, answer to this Treatise, I shall susib to their opinion, and recant what I have written. But if they cannot performe t, (as I am certaine they are altogether unable) then let them retract their former vaine glorious vaunts and abjure their pre∣tended Ius Divinum by subscribing to that truth, (which they are unable to contradict) and laying downe their Bi∣shoprickes at (least their Rochests) as they have oft-times solemnly protested they would doe. If they can or will doe neither, they must give all the world leave to passe this censure on them. That they have neither that learning truth or honesty in them as hitherto they would make the world beleeve they had And that they may have no starting hole to evade: I shall in as few words as may be, answer what ever they can Ob∣ject for themselves out of any undoubt∣ed Atiquity which is but this That Acces was braned for an He∣reticke by Epiphais and Augutine,Obiect 1. for affirming Bishops and Presbiters to bee equall one to the other: by divine insti∣ution: This is all that either the Thomas VValdensis Tom: 3, c. 60, 61, 62.

or Antiquity; and this in truth is a good as nothing. For first this opinion of Aerius was never condemned as Hereticall, by any Counsell or Father whatsoever, but only by Epiphanius, who alone is unsufficient to brand or make any man an Hereticke. Saint Augustine indeed (if the Booke be his cites this opinion of his, out of Epi∣phanius in his Book de haeresibus, c, 53, yet he brands it not as an Heresie, but stiles it Proprium Dogma in expresse termes to wit, his proper assertion (and his owne too) taxing him only of Heresie forsi∣ding with the Arrians in their branded heresie, Origi∣um l, , c, 5 Isiodor Hispalensis & Causa . qu, 3, Gra∣tian reciting the Heresie of Arrius makes no mention a all either of this as an Heresie or error in him, passing it over in silence and expresly averring it thē∣selves as a truth. Wherefore no ancient Counsell or Author whatsoever but Epiphanius brand∣ing it either for an heresie or Error. I see not well how it should be so estee∣med. Secondly, this hath been the constant received Doctrine both of Christ and his Apostles, of all the Fathers and lear∣ned Orthodoxe writers, in all ages as the precedent Catalogue witnesseth, therefore no Heresie or Error, as Epi∣phanius and some few of late (out of him alone) have rashly deemed it. Thirdly, it cannot properly be called an Heresie, because the superiority of Bi∣shops over other Ministers, by a dvine institution, as no fundamentall point of faith, neither hath it any foundation at all in Scripture, as I have elsewhere ma∣nifested. Therefoe it is most absurd to call it an heresie. Fourthly, Epiphaius there condemnes Aerius as much for reprehending and censuring Prayer for the dead, as for affirming Bishops and Presbiters to bee equall. But this our Prelates must confesse (unlesse they renounce this Doctrine of our Church) was no Error or Heresie in Aerius but rather in Epiphanius, why not therefore the other. Fifthly, Epiphanius himselfe doth not  condene Arius his opinion in this particular for an Hereticko but onely as a fond opinion (as his words) E quod tota res stutitiae plena est apud prudentes ma∣nifestum est. Sixthly, St. Hierom Naziazen, Basill  Sedulius Ambrose, Chrisostome, and August∣ine taught the same Doctrine that Aerius did, at or about the same time, but they were never taxed of Heresie or Error for it either then or since: why then should Arius only be blamed who argues just as Hierome doth, producing the same Scip∣ture to prove his assertion as Hierom hath done in his Epistle to Evagrius & on Tit. 1. Seventhly, Epiphanius his refutations  of Aerius his Arguments and opinion is very ridiculous, false, and absurd. For first he saith, that Presbiters then had not the power of ordination, nei∣ther did they use to lay on hands, in the election and Ordination of Ministers, which is a meere falshood, as Hierom in Soph. c. . with the th. Counsell of Carthage, witnes, and I have elsewhere manifested at large. Secondly, he saith that Presbiters had  no voice in the Election of Bishops and Ministers, which is See Ap∣pendix cata∣logo testium veritis End∣merus hist. novorum l, 2 3, p, 34, 36, 50, 71, 97, 109, 110, 112, 131, 132, God∣wi cata∣logue of Bi∣shops, p, 74.1, 84.106, 437, 516.525, Aventinus Armak, Boi∣corum, l, 3, p. 214, 219, and hereto∣fore p: 9.93, 103. contrary to all Antiquities, extant, and a most palpa∣ble untruth. Thirdly, he saith that there were then more Bishops then Presbiters and men sufficient & worthy enough to be made Bishops but no Presbyters, and therfore the Apostle writing to the Philippians and others makes mention only of Bishops, not of Presbyters, because they had then Bishops but not Presbyters. A miserable ridiculous, answer, which subverts that he contends for, and consti∣tutes Bishops without any Ministers un∣der their command or jurisdiction whence it will necessarily follow. That seeing the Apostles instituted Bishops without Ministers under them, ad more Bishops then Presbiters, there ought now to bee no Presbiters subject to Bishops, but Bishops to be plced in e∣very church without any Mini∣sters under hem, but Deacons only and more Bihops then Mini∣sters, which I presume the Lordly Pre∣lates will not grant, for this would over-turne
not only their Lordships, but their iocese and Episcopalities Fourthly, he saith that the Apo∣les first constituted Bishops onely in the Church, withut Elders and then they afterwards elected Elders as they fund them worthy, which is contrary to St i. ad Ev∣r & , in Ti 1. Ierome and ll an∣tiquity averring that Elders were first ordained in euery Church,  14 23, Tit. 1, 5, and that they after∣ward elected a Bishop out of them∣selves. Fifthly, he saith that the Apostles used to write to the Bishops of one Church in the plurall number, when there was but one Bishop there, which is very improbble yea con∣trary of all other expositors, on hil. . 1. Tit. 1, 5, 7, Act. 20, 17, 2. Sixthly, he peremptorily deter∣mines Timothy to be a Bishop which I have elsewhere proved false, and fom this false ground would prove Bishops and Presbiters distinct. Seventhly, he interprets an Elder  in the 1 Tim. 5.1, to be a Presbiter which most Fathers else expound on∣ly to be an ancient man. Eightly, he would prove Timothy a Bishop and Bishops to be Superior too, and distinct from Presbiters, because Paul exhorts him not to re∣buke an Elder, but to exhort him as a Father, and not to receive an accu∣sation against an Elder, but under two or three witnesses, which are grosse inconsequence (as I have else where manifested) so that Epiphanius whilst he goes about to prove Aerius his assertion still of folly steps into ma∣ny Errors, follies, and absurdities himselfe, as Tom. 1 Cntr. 5, l, 1 , 15. . Bellarmine is infor∣ced to confesse, though desirous to make the best of it.

If they object the Authority of Obiect. . Epist. 5, 6, 7 8, 9, 10. Espen∣cus digresi. in Tim. l 3, c, 1, 2, 3 Ignatius that he advanceth Bishops a∣bove Presbyters commanding them to obey the Bishops as the Apostles obeyed Christ, and willing the peo∣ple to be subject to their Bishops as to God and Christ, and to their El∣ders as to Christs Apostls: therfore in his daies Bishops were Superior to Presbiters. To this I answer,Aser. that these Epi∣stles of Ignatius are false and spurious as many Cci censu p, 5, &c. of our learned men have proved at large, therefore of no Au∣thority. Secondly, it is cleer by Acts 10.2 Phil. 1. 1. Tit. 1, 5, 7. that in Ignatius his daies Bishops & Presbiters were all one both in Title, office, and ju∣risdiction: that there were many Bishops in every chiefe City and
Church, not any sole ishop para∣mount the Presbiters, over one or many Churches: and that Diocsan Bishops were instituted long after the Apostles and therefore after Ig∣natius his dayes (who lived in the A∣postles age) as all Authors forecited accord and the whole Clergie of En∣gland, in their Institution of a Chri∣stian man dedicated to King Henry the 8 resolue in direct termes, These Epistles therefore of Ignatius which spek of one Bishop in a hurch, di∣stinct rom and superior to Presby∣ters must needs be orged. Thidly, Ignatius in these Epistles makes Bishops successors to Christ and to sand in his stead, and Presby¦ters to succeed the Apostles, where∣as all others maes them successors to the Apostles only, not to Christ, who Heb, 7, 24. let no successor or Vicar generall behind him, bt Heb. 7:17, 1 24, 28, 1 Pt, 2, 9. remains hiselfe for ever the High-Priest, chiefe Shepheard and Bishop of our Sules, and hath promised Matth. 28, 20. to e with us alwaies even to the end of the world: This therefore maes his Authority but suspicius and coteptible. Fourthly, Ignatius hath not oe word in him that Bishops are supe∣rior to ebiters y any divine lw or istitution (the thing in questi∣on) therefore his Authority (if ge∣uine) proves nothing for the opo∣sites. Fifthly, Ignaius equals Bishops and Presbyters both in jurisdiction, rule, and Authority, for pist. . ad ral∣anus he writes thus: ut be ye sub∣ject to the Presbyters as to the Apo∣stles of Christ: for the Presbyters are a certaine conjoyned Sessions and ssembly of Apostles Epist. 6. ad Magnesianes rebyteri president o∣co Sinatus Apostolis The resbyters rule in the place of the Senate of the Apostles.

O cii l, 2, c, 17, Amalarius or∣unatus de Ec∣cles Officij l 2, c, 13.6 Fathers witnesse. Sixthly, Epist, 5, 6, 10. Ignatius confesseth that the Churches in those dayes were not ruled by the Bishops as they are now but by the Colledge Senate and Sy∣nod of the Elders, & communi Praes∣bytoum concilio as Hierome Epist. ad Ena∣grilem & in Tit. 1. and all other after him affirme the Presbiters therefore had then equall and joynt authority with the Bishops even in point of Iurisdiction & go∣vernments and did rle and govern, the Church in common with them, therefore the Bishops were not then Lords Paramount, as now they mae themselves, but equall and one with them, yea their Colleagues & companions as Quid ve S∣cdoium aliud estquam sacerc∣as consiliary & assessorores Eis∣copo Epist: 5. Ignatius and the Can, 35, col∣legam se Presby∣terorum ess cog∣nosat ourh counsel o Cahge stile thē. Seventhly, his words Epist 5 6 7. that they shuld e sbject to the Bishop as to God and Christ, if rightly understood mae nothing for the Prelates Hier∣achie or Saint Paul Ephes. 6, 5.6, 7. comands servants to be obedi∣ent unto them that are their Masters according to the flesh, with eare and embling in singlenese of heart as unto Christ, not with eye-service as en pleasers but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from his heart, with good will, doing ser∣vice unto the Lord, and not to men, &c. Is therefore every Master a Bi∣shop, equall unto Christ, and superior in inrisdiction and degree to Presbyters No, So Polycarpus in his Epistle to the hilippians char∣geth them Subjecti estoe Presbyteris & Diacons sicut Deo et Christo I∣bid to be subiect to their Elders as unto God and Christ using the same words of Elders as Ignatius doth of Bishops. Are Prebyters therefore Paramount Bishops, and succesos to Christ himselfe? I trow not Ignatius his meaning therefore is not, that Bishops are as high above Presbyters and the people as God and Christ are above the Apostles (as some See Espenus Digress. in Ti l, 1, c, 12, 3. ambitious Prelates fansie) but only that we must obey Bishops
in all things that they command and prescribe us out of Gods word, as farre orth as we would obey God or Christ himselfe, for he that heareth them, heareth Christ himselfe, and hee that despiseth them, despiseth God and Chist himselfe. Luke 10.16. 1 Thes. 4 8. In this manner like∣wise are we to be subject to every Minister whatsoever Heb. 13.17.7.1 Thes. 2.13. This therefore proves nothing for the Prelates superiority over other Bishops, especially since this Ignaus himselfe Epist. 5 charg∣eth the Trallians to reverence De∣cons (ineor to resbyters) as Christ himselfe, whose Vicars they are. As for those extravagail expres∣sions of Ignatius Episl. 5. Episcopus typum Dei Patris mnium geut, quid enim aliud est Episcopus quam is qui m∣ni incipatu & protestate Superior est & quod homini licet pro viribus imitator Christi Dei factus, (and the See Coci cen∣sura p. 61.62.63 like) on Espencaeus di∣gres, in Til, 1  1.2 which same ground both the Popes and Prelates Monar∣chie, they are so ridiulous, alse, ambitious, and hyperbolical, as favor neither of Ignatius or any Christian, but rather of a meere papall and An∣ti-christian spirit discovering these Epistles to be none of his, and those relats who assme these speeches to themselues to be Rom. .9. none of Christs Mat. 11.29. All which considered this forged Atiquity will stand thē in no stead at all, to prove them supe∣rior or distinct from Presbyters by any diuine institution, and other Antiquity, making for them I find not extant. That Presbyters and Bishops by Gods law and Ordination are both one and the same & of equall autho∣rity and jurisdiction as all these au∣thorities resolve, I shall undeniable manifest by this one Argument. Presqyters by the expresse resolu∣tion of the Scripture have the very name, and not so onely but the very office of Bishops Act. 20.17, 28. Pl. 1, 1, 1. Tim. 3.1 to 5. Tit. 1, 5. to 1. the same mission, and commission, the same function, charge, Ordina∣tion, and quallification. Matth. 28.19.20. 1 Tim. 3, 1. to 7. c. 4.14. c. 5 17. 2 Tim. 4.1, 2, 1, Pet. 5, 1, 2, 3. Tit. 1, 5. to 12. neither doth the Scrip∣ture in any place make any differēce distinction, or superiority between them, or attribute any power to the one, that it doth not to the other, s the premises evidence, and Matth. 20 25.26, 27, 28. Mar. 10, 42, 43: 44 Luk. 22.25.26. Therefore by Gods law and insti∣tution they are one and the same, and of equall authority power and juris∣diction in all things. As for that distinction in power, precedency, and jurisdiction, whi hath since been made between them it hath proceeded, partly from Ca∣nons and constitutions made by Bi∣shops themselves, Institution of a Christian man ch. o Orders, partly by meer usurpation, and encrochment, but principally from the grant and large∣nesse of Christian Princes, who as they erected Bishoprickes and Dio∣cesse and multiplyed them or divided them as they saw occasion, so they limitted See Gdin Coaloge of Bi∣shops Chytr  an Sxoni, p. 23.31.226, 615.616, 617.

Againe Bishop-ricks are meer hmane institutions directly contrary to the Holy Ghost, who ordained many Bishops in every Church and City, not one Bishop o∣ver many (which he can never well instruct, rule, and oversee) Acts 20.
17.28, 1 Tim. 5.17. Pil. 1, 1, Tit. 1 5, 7. 1 Pet. 5, 1, 2, 3. Now that Epis∣copal jurisdiction which distinguish∣et Bishops rom Presbyters. was See 31, H 8. c. 9.33.

Therefore it is meerely humane, and belongs not to Bishops by any divine right, neither is it pe∣culiar unto them alone, Moreover Bishoprickes with all Episcopall ju∣isdiction; incident to them have been see Anti∣quiatae Eccle∣sia Brit.

And in Germany at this day they are given to Dukes, Earles, and Nobles, yea to Children and inants only as a temporall dig∣ity and revenue. Thereoe they are nly temprall ffices and reve∣nues, and meere huane intituti∣ons which may well be spare in the Church, not divine o Gods and Christs institution, Moreover most of the Chytraeus on Saxoniae  p 339 340, l 11 l 14 15, p. 241 43.434 435. reormed otesant church∣es beond the  the Re∣man  Bishopricks and Diocean Bishops as Anti-christian, and humane in∣tutions pernicious to the Church of Christ, and to the power puity, and progrese of the Gospell, making Bi∣ops proud, Lordly, idle, Luxui∣ous, covetous, Tyrannicall, Symo∣nicall, Seditious, Schsmatica, p∣pessive, vindictive, prophane, im∣pious, lascivious unchas, perideous, rebellious & recherous to their So∣veraigns, Therefore certainly they are no divine instiution, useull or necessary for Gods Church, and people, o which they have been the bane and ruine in all ages as our Acts and Monuments of Martyrs testifie, they being the Authors of all perse∣tions in our Church, and of al our Martyrs Buchery & blood shed.

which the Bishops are not I shall close up this discouse with a mmorable I resident of the Dnes, An Dom, 1537 Christian the third King of Denmae, removed and suppressed by publike Edict, all the Bishops of his Kingdome, for their intolerable Treasons & Rebellions, abolishing their Bishopricks as con∣trary to our Saviours institutions, (the meanes that made them, Idle, proud, ambitious, unpreaching relates, and seditious techerous Rebels to their rinces, and in stead of 7, Bishops of Demark, he insti∣tuted 7, Superintendents to execute the office of Bishops, to give orders to others, and execute all Ec∣clesiasticall afaies, which 7, Super∣intendents, (Augst 26, 1537.) e∣ceived heir ordiation from Iohn Bugenhagius ( Potestant miniser) in the Cathedrall of Hsina, in the presece of the King, and Seate of the Kingdome, Lo ee all Bishops cashiered as false rebellious Traytors to their Soveraigne, (as they have ever been in all States and ages, thee having been more notoius Traitors Rebells, and conspirtors, of Bishops then of all other ranks of men in the world (as I m able to mae good) as contrry to divine institution, and see not Iure divino, as they now bost, and Superintedents ordained by a meere esiter in their stead, to conferre orders unto others in all the Danish Churches. In the begin∣ning of reformation in Germany and other places, Luther and other Mini∣sters usually ordained Deacons and Ministers, and set out Bookes of te manner of Ordination without any Bishops assistance, which power of Ordination and imposition of hands hath, ever since been prctised by Ministers in all reformed Chuches which have abandoned Bishops (such as ours are and mae themselves as contrary to Gods word,) atrick A∣damso (Arh-Bishop of St. Andrews in Scotland,) in his recantation pub∣lickly made in the Synod of Fie, (Aprill 8, 1591,) coneseth, that this office of a Diocesan Bishop Omne uthoritate verbi dei destituitu & solo politico hminum cnmento udatur is destitute of of all autho∣rity from Gods word, and is onely ounded in the politicke figment of men, out of which the primacy of the ope or Antichrist ath sprung, and is worthily to be condemned, be∣cuse the asembly of the esbytery penes qum est jrisdictio & inspe∣ctiom in visitationibus tum in or∣dinationibus, which having the ju∣risdiction and inspection, both in vi∣sitations and in Ordinations, will performe all these things, with grea∣ter authority, piety, and zeale, then any Bishop whatsoever, whose cae is for te most part, intent not upon od or his ction, but te world which he especially serves, A  blw to our prelates Hieachie. For i Bishops be not Iure divino and have no oundation in the word of od, the the power of Ordinatiō belōgs not to them Iure divino as they ae Bishops neither can do or ught, they to conee Orders as Bishops but rely as they are Ministers: And if so (as is most certaine,) Then this power of Ordination belongs not at all to Bishops as Bisops, but only as Ministers, and every Minister as he is a Minister, ath as much right and authority to give oders as any Bishop whatsoever, the true reason why even among us at this day, Mi∣nisters ought to joyn with the Bishop in the imposition of hands, neither can our Bishops ordaine any one a Minister, unlesse 3, or 4, Ministers at least, joyne with him in the Ordi∣nation and laying on of hands. This being an apparent uth, I shal hence from the Bishops owne principles prove Presbyters Superior and grea∣ter then Bishops, in jurisdiction dig∣nity and degee. These, say they, to whom the pow∣er of Ordination belongs of Right are eater in jurisdiction, dignity, d degree then those who have not this power, and the Ordainer higher in all these then the ordained, But the power of Ordination be∣longs onely jure divino to resbyters
as presbyters, not to Bishops, as to Bi∣shops themselves, not, as Bishops, but Presbyters and Bishops when they or∣daine in a lawfull manner, do it onely as Presbyters not as Bishops. Therefore Presbyters are Superi∣or to Bishops in jurisdiction, Order, and degree, and Bishops themselves arre greater in all these as they ae Presbyters, an office of divine nction, then as they are Lordly Prelates or Diocesan Bishops, a meer humane institution. Thus are our great Lord Bishops who vaunt of the weaknesse of puri∣ne principles, whereas thir Epis∣copall are farre more feeble and ab∣sur, wounded to death with their own weapons, and all their Domi∣eering, swelling authority over∣throwne by that very principle, and foundation on which they have pre∣sumed to erect it, the ancient pro∣verbe being here truly verified, vis nsilij prs ol ruit s. I shall close p this with the words of acute A∣tius Sdl, who after a large proof of Biops and presbyter to be both ne and the same by divine institu∣tion, winds up all in this mnner. We couclude therefore, seeing that Superior Episcopall dignity is to be avouched onely humane institution, Tantum ess hmni iuris, that it is on∣ly of humne right: On the contra∣ry, since it is evident by the express testimonies of Scripture, that in the Apostles times Bishops were the same with Presbyters jur diuin ptstt ordinandi no minus presbytri qum Episcpis convenir, that by God law and divine right, the power of Ordination belongs as much to prebiters as to Bishops. I have now, I hop sufficiently ma∣ifested our Lordly prelates, Arch-ishops, Diocesn Bishops, distinct from presbyters to be none of Gods institution being therefore: none of Gods Bishop, as they vainly pretend whose then must they be, not the kings for thn they are onely Iur human which they have publikely slimed i Court therefore certainly eithe the Popes or the e∣vils or both, as many of the recited writers stile thē, for I know no other that can claime or own them: wher∣fore being neither Gods nor th Kings, but th Pope or Devills or both what remaines but that now at last they should be spred out of our Church as no members at all of Christs Church, or body but of the Devill, Pope, or Antichrist of Rome (whose limbs and creatures in tuth they are as Mauritius d D Pralln∣ti Episcopal dignitatis l, . , 1, sect, 21, & . 8, sect, 29 Ald, Henry Henry Sal∣bridge his Ex∣ortatoris Epstle Iohn Ball n I∣mage of both Churches.

I read in the Magnum chro Blgicum A 1433, p. 374. great Dutch Chronicle written by an Au∣gustin Frier, that in the year of our Lord 1033, beyond Poland there was a strange Fis taken, of the quantity, length, and breadth, and shape of a living man, adorned with a Bishop Miter a pastorall Staff, a Cassock, a white Surplesse, a Chessible Sandals Gloves and all othes Robes and or∣naments requisite to the Dignity of  Prelate, like a Bishop solemnly at∣tired and prepared to say divine Ser∣vice his Cassocke might be well lift∣ed up before, and behind, from the feet, to the knees, but not higher and he permitted himselfe to bee sufficiently andled, and touched by many but especilly of the Bishops of that Country which Fish being pre∣sented to the King, and demanded in the Language of that Country and of divers other nations who hee was, and answering othing, albeit he had opened hi mouth, giving re∣verence and honor to the Bishop that were there in the Kings pre∣sence, one Monster and dumbe un∣preaching beast saluting and respe∣cting another, the King being agry when hee had determined to com∣mit him to prisō or shut him up i sōe strōg towr, the Fis being very
sorrowfull at this newes, thereupon closed his eyes and would by no meanes open them untill the Bishops, of that Kingdome (One Monster in∣interceeds for anothers safety, but id they e∣ver so for a good pious christians life or liber∣ty?kneeling downe before the king in the fishs presece, had with many prayers intreated and ob∣tained of the King that he should be sent backe againe alive to the Sea∣shore where hee had been taken that God whose workes are incom∣prehensible might shew his nature and Acts, least otherwise a plague should there ensue, both to the King and his Subjects, which their suit the King had no sooner granted, but pre∣sently the oresaid Monster opened his eyes, giving great thankes as it were to the King, and especially to those Bishops. After with a Chariot being prepa∣red to carry the Fish backe againe, the Fish in presence of an infinite multi∣tude (of both sexes) ascending into it in a decent manner with the said Bi∣shops, ate down between them like  Domestical tame creature endued with reason. The Bishops whiles they were yet frre off from the Sea, descended out of the Chariot, and the Fish likese omming downe from the chariot by himselfe, stood upon his feet and be∣gan to walke between two Bishops, putting one of his hands upon one Bi∣shops shoulder & the other upon the other Bishops houlder, (so lovingly id these Monsters embrace on the other) as if he had been a reasonable creature, neither wondred he or was he moved with the tumult of the people who flocked round about thē, but walked modestly. When he was come to the Sea∣shore hee courteously beheld the Bihops and rout of people there pre∣sent and craving leave to depart of the Bishops with all humility, by the gesture of hi body, and obtaining it he thereupon went into the Sea∣water. And going into the Water, on his feet as high as his belly (the Se being hard y to deep for him to wade in turning himsele towards the Bishops, and people expending the end of this matter he bowed downe his head in a most humble manner bestowing a blessing on them with his right hand in forme of  crosse and fothwith descended into the depth of the Sea after which he was no more seene of any man. Thus the Historian vebatim. Now what should I make this strange dumbe Devill or Monster, in the shape, the habit and attire of a Lordly Bishop, so courteous loving, and ∣miliar towards these Lordly Bisops and they reiprocally thus to him, or what doth or could all this pretend But that Lordly Prelates with their pontificiall Masse-array, and muming disguises are meere monsters in Gods Church, and for the most part as mute as thi dumbe or other fishes in the Pulpit opening their mouthes wide oft-times, to bite, yea devoure their fellow Brethren, and God faithull people with their teeth like so many ravening woles or Sea Monsters, but seldome or never piously to instruct thē wth their diligent, pious, gracious prea∣ching tongues, and that therefore they shal one day and I hope that day is now at hand,) with all their Anti-Christian Pompe, Pride, Vestments, Trinkets, and masking massing disguised, be eternally cast out of the Church of God, sent backe againe to (the Sea of Rome) from whence they came, and there so utterly drowned, that they shall never be seen nor heard of more in our or any other true Christian Church. This hath beene already ful∣filled, not long after the appaition of this Monster in Chriau chron, Saxo∣i l. 11, p 33, 40, 41, l, 14, & 15, p, 412, 43, 44, 45, Denmarke, and most of the reformed Churches beyond
he Seas, which cast out their Lordly Prelates, as meere Anti-christian, dumbe, mishappen, ravenous Mon∣ster,, devouring Christs deare flocke, and likewise in Biscaie among the Pa∣pists Peter Hey∣lns Geogra∣phy. Edit. 3, p. 55. where Bihops ae so execra∣ble, to the people, that they will ad∣mit no Bishop so much as to come a∣mong, them or enter into their Terri∣tories, (such terrible monsers are they) insomuch that when Ferdinand the catholicie came in Progresse thi∣ther accompanied among others with the Bishop of Pampline, the people arse in Armes, draue back the Bishop and gathering all the dust which they thought he had troden on and lung it nto the Sea. And certainly their late intollerable tyanny, pride, ambtion, cruelty, op∣pression, coveuouses, Poperie, secu∣larity (for now they are altogether secula, not spirituall Lords, iniustice malice, persecutions, impieties, and monstrous prophannes, haue deserved¦ly made our Bishops as detestable as execrable to all sorts of English men (who now groane and languish under these outragious dumbe silencing and silent Monsters,) as ever hey were, or are to Bisanes, so as we shall doubt∣lesse shortly see their fatall finall ruine who now seeke nothing but the utter overthrow both of our Church, our State, and our Religion, as I will make good, at my uttermost perill, to all their faces, and proue it to their shame. We know, that two of their Cathe∣drals, Ely & Chichester, where Bishop White and Mountague, two late Inno∣vaters and Champions of the Prelates, Lord it, were lately sattered & much of them blown downe, and that the Bishop of Lincolnes chaire with the fall of his study of Bugden shattered all to peices, with a poore despicable in∣strument a suddaine unexspected blast of wind, all in one day on Novemb. 4 1636. What is this and their present great wrath, and malice against Gods peo∣ple: but a certaine prognosticke, that Rev, 12, 12. their time and Lording tyranny is short, and their totall finall ruine neer at hand, though to carnall reason it seemes impossible: and that a suddain unexpected puffe of wind, (even the prayers, cie, and teares, of those ma∣ny Godly Ministers, and poor christi∣ans they haue lately sienced, persecu∣ted, oppressed, and still proceed to vexe and greiue with all despite and cruelty, not withstanding all God plagues, all late discoveries of heir vilenes, tyranny and injusice, shall shortly and suddainly overturn their Lordly Chaires, throw downe their Epicureous Sees, Dismount their mushrom Lordships, unexspectedly sprung out of the earth, the dunghill, and swoln so great with pride and am∣bition, that they will bee all head, yea heads and Lords over all in Church and State affaires, and dash (Psal. 137..9., these Babilonish brats of Rome in peices so as they shall never recover or get head againe. In the meae time I shall pray and conclude all in the words of our En∣glish Letany From all our Lordly Prelates evill and mischiefe, from the crafts and assaults of the Devill, (who rules and workes both in and by them) from their wrath and unjust damnations, in any of their courts and Highcom∣missions, meere Spanish inquisitions,) from all their blindnes of heart, their pride vaine glory and Hypocrisie, their envy hatred, malice, and all their uncha∣ritablenesse, from all their sedition & priuy conspiracy (with Rome Priests Iesuites and betweene themselves to ruine, & root out our faithfull preach∣ing Ministers and Religion, and set up popery) from al their false doctrine and Heresie (both in Presse and Pulpit,) from their hardnesse of heart, against their poore persecuted and oppressed Brethren, against all Gods mercies, threatnings, Iudgements, ad Plague of late inflicted) and from all their contempt of Gods word and com∣mandements
in suppressing the fre∣quent Preachers, and preaching of the one, and most insolent violation of the other, especially the 2, 4, 6th Com∣mandmens, by setting up Altars, ima∣ges, crucifixes, crosses &c, & bowing downe unto them, by idolizing their owne canons ceremonies, an Ro∣mish Fopperies, by maintaining the open prophanation of Gods holy Sab∣bath, with all Heathenish sports and pastimes and spurring men on head∣long to this sinne, and starving, mur∣thering the very soules of thousands of Gods people, by robbing them of their pirituall ood, and encouraging them to al sin and dissolutenes.)
