In the first Table in the Column marked at the top with Stone weight, and over-against 8 in the Margent you find 611 l 3 ss 3 92/100 pen the Sum desired. So for a Pound weight of Silver 10 Deniers fine, the Merchant is to get out 47 l 14 ss 11 37/100 pen and so of the rest. And one is to receive for two Ounces weight of Silver 11 Deniers fine, the double value of an Ounce weight of the same fineness, which is 3 l 5 ss 7 83/100 pen to wit, 6 l 11 ss 3 66/100 pen the same way ye'l find that for 3 Drop weight of Silver 12 Deniers fine, one is to receive o l 13 ss 5 13/100 pen the triple of o l 4 ss 5 71/100 pen which is the value of one Drop weight of Silver 12 De∣niers fine. But if the Bulzeon given in to the Mint be of a fineness consisting of Deniers & Grains; For Example, a Stone weight of Silver 9 Deniers 12 Grains fine; seek in the first Table the value of a Stone weight of Silver 9 Deniers fine, which is found to be 687 l 11 ss 2 91/100 pen and to it add the value of a Stone weight of Silver 12 Grains fine found in the second Table (the same way as before in the first) to wit 38 l 3 ss 11 49/100 pen the Sum 725 l 15 ss 2 40/100 pen is the sought value of a Stone weight of Silver 9 De∣niers 12 Grains fine. The same method is to be observed in enquiring what one is to receive for any number of Stones, Pounds, Ounces, Drops, and Grains of Bulzeon of any fineness. The value of the different Weights of Bulzeon of Standart-fineness, is here inserted because of its more frequent use, albeit it might have been (as the rest) easily found, by adding together in the respective Weights the values of 11 Deniers fine and 2 Grains fine. The Fractions of Pennies in these Tables are all 100 parts, albeit for the most part they might have been of a lower denomination; that being all of the same deno∣mination, they may be more easily added.
