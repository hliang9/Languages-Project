THE FUNDAMENTALS OF THE Protestant Religion DEFINED, According to the Scripture, and Judg∣ment of the most Learned and Ortho∣dox Divines in England. Isa. 11. 9. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, for the earth shall be full of the knowledg of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea. Isa. 2. 2, 3. And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the Lords house shall be esta∣blished in the top of the mountains, and shall be exal∣ted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it. And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob, and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his path; for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem. Prov. 10. 21. The lips of the righteous feed many; but fools dye for want of wisdom. LONDON: Printed for Randall Taylor near Stationers-Hall. 1689.

THE FUNDAMENTALS OF THE Protestant Religion Defined, &c. CHAP. I. Of the Scripture. Luke 14. 45. Acts 17. 11.—18. 18. the Original or Fountain of Know∣ledg. THere are these Principles concerning the Scripture. 1. That they are the very Word of God, or they flow from God by Di∣vine Inspiration, 2 Tim. 3. 16. 2 Pet. 1. 20, 21. 2.

Psalm 19. 7. Gal. 1. 8. Deut. 12. 32. Prov. 30. 6. Revel. 22. 18. Prov. 8. 7, 8.
CHAP. II. Of God. Psalm 72. 18, 19. HItherto concerning the fountain of Knowledg. Now follows the Subject, which is God, who must be considered, 1. in his Nature. 2. In his Works. Concerning God considered in his Nature, there are four Principles. 1. That he is, Deut. 4. 7. 1 Kings 18. 39. Neh. 9. 17. Isa. 12. 2.—45. 22. Mat. 19 17. 2. That God is marvellous glorious in his Nature, Psalm 29. 18. Exod, 33. 18, 19 Isa. 62. 3. 1 Tim. 6. 16. There are ten Glories in the Nature of God. 1.

Isa. 44. 68. Matth. 12. 29. CHAP. III. Of the Creation. Revel. 4. 11. HItherto of the Nature of God; the Works of God follow. His works are either of Creation or Pro∣vidence. There are five Principles concerning the Creation. 1. That the World had a beginning, and was not eternal, Gen. 1. 1. Prov. 8. 22. Eph. 1. 4. 2. That this World, and all things therein, was made by God, Acts 17. 24. John 1. 3. Gen. 1. 1. Psalm 33. 6. Isa. 40. 28. Col. 1. 16. 3. That all was made of nothing, Rom. 4. 17. Heb. 11. 3. 4.

THere are Seven Principles that concern Gods Providence.
1. That God still knows and takes continual no∣tice of all things, Prov. 15. 3. Zech. 4. 10. 2. That God upholds and governs, and disposeth of the world, so as all things continue through him, Psalm 119. 91. John 5. 17. Acts 17. 25, 28. Psalm 104. 14, 21, 22, 28, 30. 3. That this Providence of God reacheth to all things, even the smallest things are governed and up∣held by God, Rom. 11. 36. Mat. 10. 29, 30. Psalm 147. 8, 9, 16, 17. 4. That of all Creatures, God hath most care and respect of Man, Prov. 8. 31. Psalm 8. 3, 4. 1 Cor. 9. 9, 10. and of all Men, most care of Believers, 1 Tim. 4. 10. 5. That the Good and Evil which befal Man, is not without God's Providence, Amos 3. 6. Genesis 50. 5. Job 20. 29. Isaiah 42. 24. 2 Chron. 36. 17. Jer. 24. 6. 1 Kings 11. 14. Judges 3. Jam. 1. 17. Mark for this present Providence, 1 Sam. 15. 28. Acts 13. 22. Hos. 13. 11. Psal. 75. 7. Luke 1. 11, 12. Isa. 22. 15. to the end. 6. That he doth whatsoever he pleaseth in Heaven and Earth, Psalm 115. 3. Jonah 1. 14. Eccl. 3. 14. 7. That God's Dominion is everlasting. Psalm 146. 10. Thus of the Providence of God in general. Now, as it concerns Man in special, it looks upon the State of Innocency. CHAP. V. Of Mans first Estate, viz. of Innocency. Eccl. 7. 29. THere are two Principles that concern Man's first Estate. 1. That God made Man at first, after his own Image, Gen. 1. 26. 1 Cor. 11. 7. Col. 3. 10.
2. That the Image of God consisted chiefly in Knowledg, Holiness and Righteousness, Eccl. 7. 29. Eph. 4. 24. CHAP. VI. Of the Fall of Man, so of the second Estate of Man. Eccl. 7. 29. THe Misery of Man fallen, must be considered two ways. 1. In the Cause of it. 2. In the Parts of it. 1. The Cause of it, was the fall of our first Parents; concerning which, are three Principles. 1. That our first Parents fell and lost speedily the happiness in which they were created, Gen. 3. 7. &c. And thus they did lose God, Paradice, and God's Im∣age; and that they lost it speedily, in that the Devil [one of the fallen Angels, which fell before Man did, Jude 6. 2 Pet. 2.] is called a Murderer from the be∣ginning, John 8. 44. And the fault being presently re∣lated after the Story of his Innocency in the Creation, Gen. 3. 10. 2. That this loss befel them only, for their own grie∣vous Sin, Gen. 3. Rom. 5. 12. Eccl. 7. 29. 3. That by their Sin we are all defiled, and depri∣ved of the Glory of God, Rom. 5. 12, 18, 19. Of Ori∣ginal Sin, see Job 14. 4. Eph. 2. 3. Gen. 5. 3. with Gen. 1. 6. Psalm 51. 5. Eph. 4. 22. Rom. 7. 7.—8. 13. Jam. 1. 14. It's seat is the whole Man, and the whole of Man, Rom. 3. 10, to 18. It hath its Privative part, that is, want of original Righteousness, Rom. 3. 10, 11, 12. 2dly, Positive, that is, Inclination to all Evil, Rom. 3. 14, 15, 16. and Jam. 1. 14. Rom. 7. 7.
CHAP. VII. Of Sin. Rom. 5. 12. HItherto of the Cause of our Misery; the Parts fol∣low, viz. 1. Sin 2. Punishment. The Princi∣ciples concerning Sin, are five. 1. That all Men have sinned, Psalm 14. 1, 2, 3. Prov. 20. 9. 1 Kings 8. 46. Rom. 3. 9. Eccl. 7. 20. Jam. 3. 2. 1 John 1. 8. 2. That the nature of Man is stained with Sin from the Birth, Job 14. 4.—15. 14. Psalm 51. 5. See before, about original Sin. 3. That all Men sinned in Adam, Psal. 51. 5. Rom. 5. 12. 4. That this Infection hath overspread the whole Na∣ture of Man, hence called the old Man, Eph. 4. 22. The Nature of Man is tainted with fourteen Evils. 1. The first is in Col. 1. 13. 2. The second, Eph. 4. 18. 3. The third, Isa. 44. 20. 1 John 15. 5. 2 Cor. 3. 5. 4. The fourth, Rom. 8. 7.—7. 23. 5. The fifth, Tit. 1. 15. Psalm 14. 3. 6.

The eleventh, 1 Cor. 8. 7. 1 Pet. 2. 8. 12. The twelfth, Eph. 2. 2. 13. The thirteenth, Corruption of memory, forget∣ting Good, and retaining Evil. 14. The fourteenth, Jam. 1. 14.
5. That besides these Sins, which stick fast upon our Natures, every Man is guilty of horrible, and many vile actual Sins Psal. 14. 1, 2, 3. Job 15. 15, 16. Rom. 3. 12. Gen. 6.  Isa. 46. 6. Gen. 5. 19, 20, 21. CHAP. VIII. Of the Punishment of Sin. Rom. 5. 12. 2 Thes. 1. 9. Nah. 1. 3, 6. Job 10. 17.—31. 3. Eph. 2. 3. THe Seventeen sorts of Punishment, which have been inflicted for Mans sin. 1. The first in Gen. 3. 14. 2. The second, Rom. 8. 20, 21. 3. The third, Gen. 3. 16. 4. The fourth, John 3. 36. Nah. 3. 6. 5. The fifth, Psalm 30. 2. 6. The sixth, Eph. 2. 2. 2. Tim. 2. 26. 7. The seventh, Eph. 2. 1.—4. 18. Ezek. 11. 19.—36. 26. 8. The eighth, Gen. 3. 19. Deut. 28. 21, 22. 9. The ninth, Deut. 28. 16, 17, 18. 10. The tenth, Isa. 59. 2. Job 31. 2. Acts 17. 30. 11. The eleventh, Mal. 2. 2. Psalm 69. 22. Prov. 1 26. 12. The twelfth, Rom. 1. 26, 28. 13.

CHAP. IX. Of the Estate of Grace. Eph. 1. 4. HItherto of the Estate of Man. The third state, is the Estate of Grace, which is three ways to be considered, 1. In respect of the means of the founda∣tion of it. 2. In respect of the Subject of the Posses∣ssion of it, which is the Church. 3. In respect of the degrees of Application, and Manifestation of it, which are two, viz. Justification and Sanctification. 1. The means of foundation of it, is twofold: 1. Election in God. 2. Redemption by Christ. Concerning Election, there are these five Principles. 1. That there was a Choice and Election made by God, Eph. 1. 4. 2. That this Choice was before the World was, Eph. 1. 4. Rom. 9. 11. 3. That some Men were chosen, not all; if all were taken, how could there be Election? Mat. 20. 16.—22. 14. 4. That the Cause of our Election, is only the free Grace of God, not Faith or Works foreseen, Eph. 1. 5. Rom. 9. 15, 18. 5. That God's Election is unchangeable; all the Elect shall be saved, Rom. 8. 30. Isa. 46. 10. 2 Tim. 2. 19. John 6. 37. Matth. 25. 34. Rom. 11. 29. John 10. 28, 29. It's an eternal Decree of God; whereby he freely and infallibly appointed for the Glory of his Name, to bring some Men to Glory by Christ, Eph. 1. 4, 5, 6.
CHAP. X. HItherto of Election. The second fundamental Means of Grace, is Christ; concerning whom the Principles respect, either, 1. His Person. 2. His Office. The Principles concerning his Person, looks either, 1. On his Divine, 2. or upon his Humane Na∣ture. The Principles concerning his Divine Nature, are 1. That he is very God, proved, 1. By the Testimony of Scripture, Isa. 9. 6. 1 Tim. 3. 16. Rom. 9. 5. John 1. 1. 1 John 5. 20. Genesis 3. 9, 16. Jer. 23. 6. Heb. 1. 8. 2. By Divine Properties given unto him; as Eternity, John 1. 1.—17. 5. Omnipotency, John 3. 31. Phil. 3. 21.—4. 13. Omnisciency, Heb. 4. 13. John 2. 25. Sa∣viour, John 4. 42. King of kings, &c. Rev. 19. 16. 3. by Divine works done by him, as Creation, Col. 1. 16. Forgiveness of Sins, Matth. 9. 6. working of Mi∣racles, John 10. 25. beginning and carrying on the work of Grace in his, Heb. 12. 2. and glorifying of them, John 17. 22. Mat. 25. 34. 4. By Divine Honour due to him; as Adoration, Psalm 45. 11. Heb. 1. 6. and believing in him, John 14. 1. Acts 13. 39. praying to him. 5. By the Conquest, the Gospel hath made in the Work, 1 Tim. 3. 16. and that not by any carnal Power, Zech. 4. 6. 6. Matth. 28. 18. 7. Psalm 68. 18. with Eph. 4. 9, 10, 11, 12. 8. His making the Gospel efficacious to the Conver∣sion of Sinners, Psalm 45. 6. Acts 11. 18. 9. Revel. 1. 18.
10. John 10. 28. 11. 2 Tim. 4. 1. It was needful our Mediator should be God. 12. The patient Sufferings of the Saints, Rev. 12. 11. 1. Because our Evil was so great, which no Crea∣ture could take off us, viz. 1. Sin. 2. Gods Wrath. 3. Death. 4. Satan's Tyranny. 2. Because the greatness of our Good, which none but God could restore; viz. 1. An Obedience to ju∣stify many. 2. The Image of God, 1 Cor. 1. 30. Col. 3. 10. CHAP. XI. Of Christ's Humane Nature. THere are four Principles concerning it. 1. That the Son of God was incarnate, did as∣sume the Nature of Man, and was very Man amongst us, John 1. 14. Heb. 2. 14. 2. That he was not conceived as other Men, but by the Holy Ghost, Luke 1. 35. Matth. 1. 20. 3. That he was born of a Virgin, Isa. 7. 14. Matth. 1. 18. Gen. 3. 15. 4. That his Human Nature did subsist in the Divine Nature, and so both made but one Person, (as Soul and Body make but one Person) Col. 2. 9. Luke 1. 35. He is Man, 1. That Satisfaction might be made to God in the same Nature that offended. 2. Because, else he could not dye. 3. And without that, no Pardon, Heb. 9. 22. 4. Because a Mediator should be mete to deal be∣tween both Parties, therefore he is God, for the business
with the Father and Man, for the business with Men. 5. Might have the right of Kinsman to redeem us, and so of Adoption, Jer. 32. 8. Ruth 3. 12. CHAP. XII. Of Christ as Mediator. HItherto concerning the Person of Christ; his Of∣fice follows. The Principles concerning his Of∣fice, consider it in the whole, or in the part of it; the whole Office of Christ is to be a Mediator; and so the Principles which concern the Mediatorship, are five. 1. That there is but one Mediator between God and Man, viz. Christ, 1 Tim. 2. 5. Acts 4. 12. Luke 2. 11. See his Qualification, Heb. 2. 17.—7. 25. 2. That our Salvation by his Mediation, is merit, desert in Man, but Grace in God and Christ, 2 Tim. 1. 9. Tit. 3. 4, 5. Eph. 2. 8. Rom. 3. 24. 3. That this Mediation was from the beginning of the World, and shall be to the end, Heb. 13. 8. 1 Pet. 1. 20. Rev. 13. 8. The time when this Mediator was given, was, 1. If we respect God's Decree, he was given before the World, Eph. 1. 4. 2. If we respect the Virtue and Efficacy of his Me∣diation, he was given when need was, from the be∣ginning of the World, Rev. 13. 8. 3. If we respect his Manifestation in the Flesh, he was given in the fulness of time, above 1600 years ago, Gal. 4. 4. 1 Tim. 2. 6. 4. That without the Mediation of Christ, no Flesh can be saved, Acts 4. 12. Psal. 134. 2. Jam. 3. 2. 5. That by the Mediator, a new Covenant, Agree∣ment, or Contract, was made by God with Man, Jer.
31. 33. Heb. 8. 13. Rom. 3. 23, 24. Gal. 3. 21, 22. For the meaning of this, Note, 1. That the Scripture speaks of four, that God hath made one with all Creatures, Gen. 9. But of this we have nothing to do here. 2. A Covenant between the Father and Son, which one expresses thus: Methinks, says he, I hear the Fa∣ther say, Son, here I have chosen a certain number of fallen Men, they are Enemies to me; if you will as∣sume their Nature, and satisfy my Law and Justice, and restore my Image, bring them to Faith and Re∣pentance, I will pardon, adopt and glorify them. He makes Heb. 10. 7. to be Christ's answer to the Father, so the Agreement was made, Isa. 42. 6. 3. A Covenant of Works; this was made with all mankind in Paradice, and standeth still in force since the fall, as Men are in the Estate of Nature; the Con∣ditions whereof on Man's part, is the moral Law. 4. Man by his fall being made uncapable of Life by that Covenant, God was pleased to make a Cove∣nant or Agreement with Man, by means of the Medi∣ator, and gives unto them the Conditions of it, as Faith, Repentance, sincere Obedience, Eph. 2. 8. 2 Tim. 2. 26. Acts 11. 18.—5. 31. Ezek. 36. 26, 27. and eternal Life, and all Good. God ingaged in this Covenant to give to all those that believe, &c. which is called the Covenant of Grace; This was called from the fall to Abrahams time, the Promise; being contrived in those words of Promise, Gen. 3. 15. from Abraham to Moses, the Covenant, Gen. 17. 7. From Moses to Christ, and so still, the Testament, and as it stands in difference from the Covenant of Works, it may be called for all this time, the Covenant of Grace. 2. That in this Covenant, the Mediator did under∣take for two things.
1. To pay all our Debts, and satisfy Gods Justice by a Price of infinite Value, Isa. 53. 5, 6. Job 33. 24. 1 Tim. 2. 6. 2. To Purchase and Merit for us Gods Favour and Kingdom by a most absolute and perfect Obedience, Eph. 1. 6. Rom. 5. 19. Mat. 3. 15. 3. We must understand wherein the Covenant of Works and Grace differ and agree. 1. They agree in two things. 1. Both tendered to us by God. 2. Both require a full and perfect Righteousness, as the condition of Eternal Life. 2. They differ. 1. In the manner of knowing them, the 1. is known. in some measure by Nature, Rom. 2. 15. the 2d not, Col. 1. 26. 1 Cor. 2. 7. 2 Tim. 1. 10. 2. In the Ministers of both, John 1. 17. 3. In the means attaining the end common to both; the first requires doings for Life, Rom. 10. 5. The se∣cond, Faith, Rom. 3. 21.—4. 5. Acts 16. 31.—13. 39. John 3. 16. The Law requires perfect, and perpetual, and universal Righteousness in our own Persons, Gal. 3. 10. The Gospel offers this personal, perfect, perpetual, universal Righteousness of another to be received, and is ours by Faith, Rom. 8. 3, 4.—3. 22.—5. 19.—10. 4. Dan. 9. 24. 1 Pet. 1. 19. Matth. 3. 15. 4. In effect, Efficacy; the first requires Works, but gives no Power to do them, Deut. 29. 4. The second gives the Spirit which works what God requires, Jer. 31. 33. Ezek. 36. 27. 1 Cor. 3. 9.
CHAP. XIII. Of the Prophetical Office of Christ, Deut. 18. 18. HItherto of the Principles that look on the Office of Christ; in the whole, the Principles that con∣cern the Parts of his Office, follow. There are three Parts of the Offices of Christ. 1. His Prophetical. 2. Priestly. 3. Kingly. This Division may be proved. 1. By the Degrees of Man's misery; which is, 1. Ig∣norance. 2. Unruliness. 3. Guiltiness; as a Prophet heads the first, as a King the second, and as a Priest the third. 2. By the Parts of the Typical Anointing in the Old Testament, which was threefold, 1. of Prophets. 2. Priests. 3. Kings. 1. Of his Prophetical Office; where, 1. What it is. 2. Parts of it. 3. The manner of executing of it. 1. The Prophetical Office of Christ, is that Work, by which he instructs his Church concerning the Will of God, especially his Secret Council about redeeming Mankind; the Parts are two. 1. External, Promulgation of Doctrine, which hath three things in it; 1. The Preaching of the Gospel, or the Doctrine concerning God's Grace or Redemption by Christ, Isa. 61. 1. Luke 4. 18. 2. The Interpretation of the Law, according to the mind of the Lawgiver, Matth. 5. 17. &c. 3. Prediction of things to come, Matth. 24. 2, &c.
2. The internal Illumination of the heart, or the making Doctrine effectual by the Spirit, renewing and inclining the Mind and Will of Man, John 5. 25. 1 John 2. 20, 27. 3. Of executing it, was, 1. Mediately, by Patriarchs and Prophets in the Old Testament. 2. Immediately, and that either by his Divine, or both Natures; by his Divine, he instructed the Patriarchs and Prophets in the Old Testament by Visions, Oracles and Dreams; by both Natures, by the word of mouth in the New Testament, he himself taught amongst Men, 1 Pet. 3. 19. John 1. 5. The Principles concern∣ing this Office, are Seven. 1. That in Christ all was; see Col. 2. 3. 2. That it's Christ only that reveals the Truth out of the Bosom of the Father, Matth. 11. 27. John 1. 18.—6. 68. 3. That Christ hath himself taught Doctrine amongst Men, Heb. 1. 2. Luke 4. 18. 4. That he hath revealed the whole Council of God, John 15. 15. Deut. 18. 18. John 17. 8. 5. That the Ministry in the Church, is by Authori∣ty from Christ, Matth. 23. 24. Eph. 4. 11. 2 Cor. 5. 19. 6. That the whole Efficacy of Doctrine recorded in the Scripture, or thence taught unto Men, depends on Christ, 2 Pet. 1. 20, 21. 1 Cor. 3. 9. 7. That it belongs generally to all Nations, Isa. 49. 6. Zech. 9. 10.
CHAP. XIV. Of the Priestly Office of Christ. Psalm 110. 4. Heb. 6. 20.—4. 15.—9. 12. WHich is that part of Christ's Office, whereby he maketh Satisfaction to God for Men. This Office in the Execution of it, hath three Parts, or there be three things which Christ must do, as the Priest of the Church. 1. He must obey God's Law perfectly. 2. Make Expiation for our Sins, by Sacrificing to God. 3. Make Intercession for us. 1. Concerning Christs Obedience; there are four things 1. That he was without Sin in his Nature, John 8. 46. 2 Cor. 5. 21. 1 Pet. 1. 19.—2. 22. Heb. 4. 15. 2. That he fulfilled the Law of God perfectly in all his Actions, Acts 2. 27.—13. 35.—3. 14.—4. 27. 1 John 2. 20 3. That he fulfilled the Law not only for himself, but for us in our room and stead, and for our sakes, Rom. 8. 3, 4.—10 4.—5. 18, 19. 4. That this Righteousness of his is everlasting; that is such a righteousness as cannot be lost; so better than Adams in the Estate of Innocency, Dan. 9. 24. CHAP. XV. Of the Expiation of Sin, which was by the Passion of Christ. Eph. 5. 2. Col. 1. 20. Heb. 9. 27. COncerning Christ's Passion, there are six Principles. 1. That the Passion of Christ was by the decree and everlasting fore-appointment of God, Acts 2. 23. 1 Pet. 1. 20.
2. That the Sufferings of Christ were in our room and stead, i. e. for our Sins, and for our Sakes, 1 Pet. 2. 24. Isa. 53. 6, 5, 8, 12. Rom. 4. 25. 1 Cor. 5. 7. 3. That by his Passion he did atone, pacify God, and make Expiation for all our Sins, Eph. 5. 2. Mat. 3. 17. 1 John 2. 2. 4. That in his own Person he fulfilled and finished all Sufferings needful for our Salvation; he did at once for all the Elect, 1 Pet. 3. 18. Heb. 9. 28.—10. 11, 12. 5. That the Passion of Christ is a sufficient price for the Sins of the whole World, John 1. 29. 6. That Christ suffered extreme things for us; see John 17. 5. Luke 21. 2. Matt. 8. 20.—2. 14. Mark 3. 6, 7. John 11. 54.—8. 59. 2 Cor. 5. 21. Heb. 2. 18.—4. 15. Isa. 53. 12. CHAP. XVI. Of Christ Intercession; that third Part of his Priesthood. Rom. 8. 34. THere are four Principles. 1. That he sits at God's right Hand, and does it for us, Rom. 8. 34. Heb. 7. 25. 2. That we have no other Intercessor in Heaven, but Christ, 1 Tim. 2. 5, 6. Isa. 59. 16. 3. That it's perpetual; he so doth it once, as he will never fail to do it in all Ages, Heb. 7. 25, 28. 4. That he makes Intercession only for the Elect, John 17. 9. For the Explanation of these Principles, three things must be opened. 1. The Acceptation of the word; it signifies, 1. Pray∣er, 1 Tim. 2. 1. 2ly, Complaint, Rom. 11. 2. Acts 25. 24. 3ly, Usually that part of Christs Mediation, in which he appears before God, to prevent his Displeasure towards the Elect, Rom. 8. 34.
2. How many ways Christ make Intecession for us, viz. 7. 1. He presents himself before God with his Merits, tendering his Sacrifice for our Satisfaction, Heb. 9. 24.—9. 12. and so pacifying God towards us, Jer. 30. 13. 2. He prayed, and still doth pray for us; all his Prayers on Earth, were a part of his Intercession; and he still prays for us in Heaven, Rom. 8. 34. Heb. 7. 25. 3. He offers up our Prayers and Praises to God, Rev. 8. 3, 4. 4. Undertakes for us, before God gives his Word for, us, that we shall eschew Sin by his Grace, and not provoke God any more, as we have done, John 17. 6.—25. 26. 5. He pleads our Cause as an Advocate, and Removes, and Nonsuites all Accusations, which Justice, Law, Conscience, Men or Devils, may make against us to God, Rom. 8. 34. 1 John 2. 1. 6. Poureth out upon us his Spirit of Intercession, which causes us what to do, see Rom. 8. 26, 15. Gal. 4. 6, 7. 7. He sprinkleth his Blood upon us by Application of his Merits to us, which cryes and makes Intercession for us, Heb. 12. 24. 3. In which Nature he makes Intercession? it's an∣swered in both, as a Man praying, it's with his Soul and Body he prays, if right vocal Prayer; so Christ pleads as one Person, tho two Natures. CHAP. XVII. Of Christ's Kingly Office. COncerning which, there are Seven Principles. 1. That he overcame Sin, Death, Grave and Hell, and rose again from the Dead, and ascended in∣to Heaven, and sitteth on the right hand of God, Rom. 4.
25. 1 Cor. 15. 54. Joh. 20. 12. Mark 16. 6, 14. 2 Tim. 2. 8. Mark. 16. 19. Luke 24. 51. Acts 1. 9. Eph. 4. 8, 9, 10. Heb. 1. 9.—8. 1. Eph. 1. 20, 21. Col. 3. 1. 2. That Christ, who puchased the Church by his Blood, is appointed of God, the King, and Head of the Church, and Prince over the People of God, having all Power in his own hands, Psal. 2. 6. Mat. 28. 18. Col. 1. 18. Rev. 19. 16. 3. That he is likewise appointed to be the Lawgiver to his Church, and the Judg of the World, Jam. 4. 12. John 5. 12. Acts 10. 24.—17. 31. 2 Tim. 4. 1. 4. That his Government extended to the People of all Nations, Psal. 2. 8. Matth. 28. 19. Phil. 2. 10, 11. 5. That  Kingdom is not of this World, but a Spiri∣tual and Coelestial Kingdom, John 18. 36. Rom. 14. 17. 6. That he will be with his to the end of the World, Matth. 28. 19. 20. 7. That his Kingdom is an everlasting Kingdom, Luke 1. 33. Heb. 12. 28. Dan. 2. 44.—7. 14. For the Explication of this Office of Christ, note four things. 1. That Christ sought for his Kingdom, and over∣came Satan, Sin, Death, and Hell, and rescued his Sub∣jects from their Thraldom, 1 Cor. 15. 54, 55. Col. 2. 15. Heb. 2. 14. and this Victory he accomplished, and proclaimed in his Resurrection. 2. The Kingly Glory of Christ consisted in two things. The 1. Was the Glorification of his Humane Nature, be∣ing dispossessed of all Infirmities accompanying our Na∣ture; so as he ceased to be hungry, to be weary, &c. nor could he suffer any more, or dye. 2. That the perfecting of his humane Nature with all the degrees of coelestial Gifts and Endowments, could possibly befal a created Nature, both in Body and Mind; his glorified Body surpassing the Sun for brightness, Matth. 17. 2. Acts 9. 3.—22. 11.
2. His triumph over his Enemies, which he acted two ways. 1. In those frequent Manifestations after his Resur∣rection. 2. His Ascension, leading with him Captivity Captive, Psalm 68. 18. 3. The taking Possession of his Kingdom, and this he did when he sat at the right Hand of God, Heb. 1. 8. Eph. 1. 20, 21. 4. The Administration of his Kingdom, of which he is now possest. And this hath four things in it. 1. The calling and gathering together, both Jews and Gentiles, which belong to the Election of God, Rom. 8. 30. Eph. 4. 11, 12. Isa. 11. 11, 12. 2. The prescribing Laws, as the only Lawgiver of the Church; this he doth, when he propoundeth unto his Subjects the Rules both of believing and living by the Word and Ministry of the same, adding thereunto the Work of the Spirit, writing his Laws on their Hearts, Jam. 4. 12. Jer. 31. 33. 2 Cor. 3. 17, 18. 3. The Donation of Gifts, and enabling Men for the Kingdom of God, Eph. 4. 8. Phil. 1. 29. 4. The Execution of Justice, and so he doth Justice, 1: Among his own Subjects; and so he doth them Justice, 1. In justifying them from their Sins, Rom. 5. 19. 2. Giving reward among them, both in Spiritual and Temporal things, 1 Cor. 3. 22. 3. By keeping them in a State of Grace, so as they fall not away, Heb. 12. 2. 2. Against his Enemies, whom he, 1. Restrains and defeats them in their Counsels, Rev. 20. 1. 2 Job 5. 12, 13. 2. Subdues them, either by converting them, Psal. 45. 6. or confounding them partly by Judgements here,
and casting them to Hell at last, 2 Thes. 1. 9. The Ad∣ministration of his Kingdom he executes partly in this Life, and partly in the World to come; the one in his Kingdom of Grace, the other in his Kingdom of Glory; what is begun here, is fully made compleat in the other World. CHAP. XVIII. Of the Church. Eph. 1. 12. HItherto, of the Means of Grace; the Subject of Grace follows, and that is the Church. The Church in General is the whole Multitude of Men ele∣cted to eternal Life by God in Christ. Concerning the Church in general, there are these seven Principles. 1. That it's a Company of Men separated from the World, gathered by the voice of Christ; the word sig∣nifies such as are gathered together by the Voice of God's Cryers, John 17. 9, 14. 2. That she is one, Eph. 4. 4. Cant. 6. 10. or 3. Gal. 3. 28. one, in many respects so, because all the Godly are united mystically in one Body, Rom. 12. 5. Eph. 4. 14, 16. 3. That she is knit to Christ her head, by an indisolva∣ble Union, Col. 1. 18.—2. 19. 1 Cor. 12. 27. Eph. 1. 22, 23. One with Christ in Spirit, John 4. 13. 4. That she is Holy, Eph. 5. 2, 7. Tit. 3. 5. 1 Pet. 2. 9. Dan. 7. 18. 1. By imputed and imparted Holiness, Righteous∣ness, Rom. 3. 21, 22. Heb. 10. 10. 2. By separation from this World, 2 Cor. 6. 16, 17. Rom. 12. 2. John 15. 19. 3. By Consummation of all Holiness in the other World, Eph. 5. 27. 5. She is Catholick, i. e. Universal.
1. In respect of time, all the Godly being Members of this one Body, tho they lived in all the several Ages, since the beginning of the World. 2. In respect of place, because all the Godly, both in Heaven and Earth, are all of this one Body, Eph. 1. 10. And so from all parts of the World is the Church gathered; all the particular Churches in the World are but Members of this Church Universal; of particular Churches, read Rom. 1. 1. 1 Cor. 1. 1. 2 Cor. 1. 1. Gal. 1. 1. Eph. 1. 1. Phil. 1. 1. Col. 1. 1. 1 Thes. 1. 1. 2 Thes. 1. 1. Acts 9. 31.—15 41. Rom. 16. 4. 16. 1 Cor. 7. 17.—16. 19.—14. 33.—16. 1. 1 Thes. 2. 14. 2 Cor. 8. 1. Gal. 1. 2, 20.

The Church is Universal in respect of Persons, Rev. 5. 9, 10. Gal. 3. 28. 6. That she is Militant, that is, in this Life exposed to Crosses and Afflictions, &c. Rom. 12. 11. Eph. 6. 12. 2 Tim. 4. 7, 8. Acts 14. 23. Christ will have it so, 1. For his own Sake, that he might shew how he hates Sin, even in his own; and Justice in afflicting them; and Glory, and Power, and Mercy, in delivering them. 2. For their sakes, 1 Cor. 11. 31. Rom. 8. 28. 3. For his Enemies sake, that they may know, they shall not not be spared, 1 Pet. 4. 17.
7. That she is invincible, Matth. 16. 18. Rom. 8. 37, 38, 39. 1 Pet. 5. 10. CHAP. XIX. Of Justification. HItherto of the Subject of Grace, the Church; the degrees of Grace in this Life, are two, Justifica∣tion and Sanctification; concerning Justification there are nine Principles. 1. That all Men have sinned, and are guilty before God naturally, and in themselves, Rom. 3. 9, 23. Gal. 3. 22. 2. That by Mens own Works no Flesh can be ju∣stified, Rom. 3. 20. Gal. 2. 16, 21. Tit. 3. 5. Gal. 3. 11. Phil. 3. 9. before God. 3. That the Righteousness that maketh us just, is in Christ, and being made ours by Imputation, 2 Cor. 5. 21. 1 Cor. 1. 30. Phil. 3. 9. Rom. 3. 21, 22.—4. 7. Isa. 45. 24. Jer. 23. 6. Dan. 9. 24. Rev. 19. 8. Heb. 11. 7. Luke 15. 22. 4. That this Righteousness is made ours only by Faith, and so we are justified only by Faith, as it ap∣prehends and lays hold upon, and relies on the Righ∣teousness of Christ, Rom. 3. 28. Heb. 11. 7. Rom. 3. 22. Gal. 2. 16. Rom. 1. 16, 17. Acts 13. 39. Rom. 5. 1. 5. That this Faith is Gods Work and Gift, John 6. 29, Phil. 1. 29. Eph. 2. 8. Heb. 12. 2. 6. That all Men have not Faith, 2 Thes. 3. 2. Isa. 53. 1. Hence is that in Tit. 1. 1. 7. That there is but one kind of Faith, by which all the elect are justified, Eph. 4. 5. 8. That it's of meer Grace, Rom. 3. 24. Tit. 3. 5, 6, 7.
9. That being justified by Faith, we have Peace and Pardon, and accounted just, and dealt with as such, Rom. 5. 1.—5. 19. Others thus. 1. It's a gracious Act of God, whereby he impu∣teth the Righteousness of Christ to all Believers, and for the Merit of Christ, and freely absolveth them from all their Sins, and reputeth them just unto Life, and deals with them as such, Rom. 3. 22. Psal. 32. 1, 2. 2 Cor. 5. 21. 2. That it's twofold Legal, Rom. 2. 3. So none can be justified, Jam. 3. 2. Gal. 2. 16. Evangelical, Rom. 5. 18. 3. That the matter of our Justification is Christ's active and passive Obedience, together with his ori∣ginal Righteousness, Gal. 3. 10. Rom. 5. 19. 4. That Christ's original Righteousness is part of his Satisfaction, and of our Justification. 1. Christ's original Righteousness answers our ori∣ginal Sin. 2. The Law requires not only actual Obedience, but also original and full Conformity. 3. That a whole Christ is ours, and whatsoever he was made, did, or was, that he was made, did, and was for us, Isa. 9. 6. 1 Cor. 1. 30. 5. That his active Obedience, i. e. Obedience of his Life, was necessary to our Justification. 1. Because, as his Passive, or Obedience of his Death, was necessary for the Expiation of our Sin; so the other for the obtaining like Life Eternal, Lev. 18. 5. The second frees us from Hell and Punishment. The first gives us right to Heaven. 2. That as the Law bindeth to Punishment, threat∣ning Death to them that break it, Deut. 29. 26. So it bindeth to Obedience, promising Life to them that keep it, Luke 10. 28. Lev. 18. 5.
3. As Christ's passive, answers Mans guilt of Sin and Damnation, so his other answers Mans want of Righte∣ousness, Rom. 3. 22.—5. 19. 1 Cor. 1. 3. The one an∣swers what we should have suffered; the other, what we should have done. 6. That the parts of Justification are two. 1. Imputation of Christ's Righteousness, whereby the Believer hath his Sin covered, and is accepted, and dealt with as just in the sight of God, Phil. 3. 8, 9. 2. Remission of Sins, whereby the Believer is freed from the guilt and punishment of Sin, Col. 1. 20, 21, 22. 1 Pet. 2. 24. 7. The moving cause of Justification is twofold. 1. The inward moving Cause, is Gods Mercy, and free Love Grace, Rom. 3. 24. 2. The outward moving Cause, is the Merit, Desert and Efficacy of Christ's active and passive Obedience, or the whole Obedience of Christ; his obedient Life and Death, 2 Cor. 5. 18, 19. Rom. 5. 9. 8. The formal Cause, is the Imputation of Christ's Righteousness, Rom. 3. 22. 9. The instrumental Cause, Faith, Rom. 3. 28. 10. The final Cause, God's Glory, Eph. 1. 6. CHAP. XX. Of Sanctification. 1 Thes. 4. 3. COncerning which, are five Principles. 1. That whom God justifies, he sanctifies, Rom. 8. 30. Ezek. 36. 27. 2. That to be truly sanctified, is to dye to Sin, and to rise again to newness of Life in Righteousness, Rom. 6. 1, 2, 3, 4. or it's to repent and believe the Go∣spel, Mark 1. 15.
3. Without it is no Salvation, John 3. 5. Heb. 12. 14. 1 John 1, 7. 2 Cor. 5. 17. 4. That its Gods Work and Guift, Acts 5. 31.—11. 18. 2 Tim. 2. 26. 1 Cor. 1. 30. Ezek. 36. 27.—11. 19. Tit. 3. 5. 5. That our Sancttification is imperfect, whilst we live in this World, 1 John 1. 8. Eccl. 7. 20. Isa. 46. 6. Prov. 24. 16. Jam. 3. 2. CHAP. XXI. Of the Resurrection. John 5. 28, 29. HItherto, of the Principles that concern the third state of Man; the fourth Estate of Man, is the Estate of Glory; and in this we are to consider the three degrees of it. 1. The Resurrection. 2. The last Judgment. 3. The Glory of Heaven. The Principles that concerns the Resurrection, are four. 1. The Body of dead Men shall rise out of the Dust of the Earth, and their own Souls shall enter into them again, Job 19. 25, 26. Isa. 26. 19. John 5. 29. 1 Cor. 15. 16. 2. The Bodies of all Men shall be raised, Joh 5. 28. great and small, Rev. 20. 12, 13. Just and unjust, Acts 34. 15. Tho the Unjust shall not rise in the same manner, nor by the same Power, that is, by Vertue of Christ's Resurrection, Dan. 12. 2. 3. That the same Body which Men carry about with them in this World, shall rise again, Job 19. 26, 27. Psalm 34. 20. 1 Cor. 15. 53. 1. Because every Man shall in his Body what he hath done, 2 Cor. 5. 10. 2. Because, else it would be absurd, that any other should be crowned, but that which suffered, or punished, but that which sinned. 4. That this Resurrection shall be at the end of the World, even the last day of it, John 6. 4. CHAP. XXII. Of the last Judgment. 2 Cor. 5. 10. HItherto, of the Resurrection; the last Judgment follows. The Principles concerning it, are Seven. 1. That there shall be a general Judgment, Jude 14. 18. Psalm 9. 8.—50. 1. Heb. 9. 27, 28. Dan. 7. 9, 10.
2. That Christ shall be Judg, and that in the Humane Nature, Acts 10 42.—17. 31. 2 Tim. 4. 1. John 5. 22. 3. That all Men shall be judged at that day, just and unjust, quick and dead, great and small, Jude 1. 5. Rom. 14. 9. 2 Cor. 5. 10. Psalm 9. 8. 4.  all the secret things of Man's Nature or Works, shall then be brought to light, Luke 8. 17. 1 Cor. 4. 5. Rom. 2. 16.—2. 5. 5. It shall be at the last Day; the precise Day and Hour is not known to any Man or Angels, Mat. 24. 36. 6 The Judgment shall be most just and righteous, and all shall confess it, Rom. 14. 10. 2 Tim. 4. 8. Rom. 2. 5. Psalm 9. 8. 7. The Judgment shall be according to mens Works, 2 Cor. 5. 10. Rom. 2. 6. CHAP. XXIII. Of the Glory of Heaven. 1 Cor. 2. 9. HItherto of the Resurrection and last Judgment, the Glory of Heaven follows. The Principles concerning that, are four. 1. Its unspeakable, and in respect of us here on Earth, in∣comprehensible, 1 Cor. 2. 9. 1 John 3. 2. Col. 3. 4. 2 Cor. 14. 4. Rev. 2. 17. Psalm 16. 11.—31. 19. 2. Eternal, Mat. 25. 46. 2 Tim. 1. 10. 1 Pet. 1. 4. 2 Cor. 5. 1. 3. It's the Gift of God, and proceeds only from his free Grace, and not for any merit in us, Luke 12. 32. John 3. 16. Rom. 6. 23. 4. The Elect only shall enjoy and obtain this Glory, 1 Cor. 15. 50. Rev. 21. 27. 1 Cor. 6. 9. Rom. 2. 7, 10.
