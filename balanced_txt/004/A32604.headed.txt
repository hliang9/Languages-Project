A PROCLAMATION PROHIBITING The Importation of divers Foreign Wares and Merchandizes into this Realm of England and the Dominion of Wales, and Sale thereof; and to Repress the excess of Gilding of Coaches and Chariots. CHARLES R. WHereas by several Acts of Parliament made in the times of Our Predecessors (that is to say) in the First year of King Richard the Third, in the Third year of King Edward the Fourth, in the Nineteenth year of King Henry the Seventh, and in the Fifth year of Queén Elizabeth, it is Enacted (a∣mongst other things) That no Merchant, Denizen nor Stranger, nor other person shall bring, send or convey from beyond the Sea into this Our Realm of England, or Dominion of Wales, any Laces, Ribbonds, Fringes, Im∣broidery, Laces of Silver or of Gold, Hats, Knives, Scis∣sers, Painted Ware, Caskets, Poynts, Gloves, Locks, or Brushes to be uttered and sold within our said Realm of England, or Dominion of Wales, by way of Merchandize, upon pain to forfeit the same Wares and Merchandizes, as of∣ten as they may be found in the hands of any person or persons to be sold, the one half of the said Forfeitures to go to the use of Our Self, and the other half to any of Our Subjects that shall first seize the same, the which to do, they are thereby Authorized.
And whereas complaint hath beén to Us made by the Artificers in this Our Realm of England (as well within Our City of London, as within other Our Cities, Towns, and Boroughs) that notwithstanding the said Statutes, and the Penalties therein contained, Foreign Wares and Merchandizes of the sorts aforesaid (amongst others) have of late been brought from beyond the Seas in great abundance, and sold within this Our Realm of England and Dominion of Wales, whereby the said Artificers and their Families are not only utterly impoverished, the youth not trained up in the said Sciences, and thereby the said Faculties, and the exquisite Knowledge thereof, like in short time, within this Our Realm to decay, but divers of Our Cities and Towns are thereby much impaired, the whole Realm greatly endamaged, and Foreign Countries much enriched: We with the Advice of Our Privy Councel, out of Our Princely care of the Artificers of this Our Realm, in the Sciences aforesaid, to whom We re∣solve to give all good encouragement, they being nothing inferiour to Foreigners (al∣though (as We cannot but take notice) Our Subjects are too inclinable to a prefer∣rence of Foreign Manufactures before Our own) and for prevention of like mischiefs for the time to come, have thought fit by this Our Proclamation to revive the notice and memory of the said Acts of Parliament, and the Penalties therein contained, to the end that all persons which are or shall be therein concerned, may not be able to pre∣tend ignorance of their dangers or duties touching the premisses: And do also by like Advice by this Our Proclamation streightly Charge and Command all Merchants, as well Denizens as Strangers, and all other persons whatsoever, not to presume at any time hereafter to bring, send or convey into this Our Realm of England, or Do∣minion of Wales, from any part beyond the Seas, any Foreign Bone-Lace, Cut-work, Imbroidery, Fringe of Gold, Silver, Silk, or Thread, Lace of Gold or Silver, Rib∣bonds, or Bever-Hats (or any other the Wares or Merchandizes above mentioned, or by the said Acts of Parliament, or any other Prohibited to be Imported) by way of Merchandize, to be sold, bartered, or exchanged within this Our Realm of England, or Dominion of Wales, contrary to the form and effect of the said Acts of Parliament, or any of them, upon the pains and penalties in the said Acts contained, which (if they do) they must expect, with the uttermost severity, to be inflicted upon them. And for that end We do hereby streightly Charge and Command all Searchers, Waiters, and all other Our Officers and Ministers whatsoever (upon the forfeiture of their Offices and Places, and such other Penalties, as for their negligences or connivances may by Law be inflicted upon them) to use their uttermost care and diligence to discover all Foreign Wares and Merchandize abovesaid, or others by the said Acts of Parliament, or any other prohibited, which shall be Imported from beyond the Sea into this Our Kingdom of England, or Dominion of Wales, contrary to the said Acts or any of them, and to seize the said Wares and Merchandizes to Our use, to the end such proceedings may be thereupon had, as shall be agreeable to the said Acts. And We do hereby re∣quire the Chief Baron and Barons of Our Publique Exchequer, and all other Our Iudges and Ministers of Iustice whatsoever, that they be very careful (as occasion shall require) to put Our Laws in due and ffectual execution against those which shall offend in the premisses. And whereas divers Acts of Parliament have been made for the restraint of the wasting of Gold by Gilding, upon great Penalties, notwithstanding which Acts, the Gilding of Coaches in and about Our City of London, and elsewhere in Our Realm of England, and Dominion of Wales, is grown into frequent and excessive use,
to the great wasting and expense of Gold, whereof by this means (amongst others) there is a great scarcity; We out of Our Royal Care to prevent this excess and mis∣chief for the time to come, Do (by like Advice of Our Privy Councel) by this Our Proclamation streightly Charge and Command all makers of Coaches and Chari∣ots, and all others which shall put to sale any Coaches or Chariots within this Our Realm of England, and Dominion of Wales, that they do not hereafter Gild any Coaches or Chariots, or cause the same to be Gilded, nor sell or expose the same to sale, being Gilded in any part thereof (except onely such Coaches or Chariots as are or shall be provided for the use of Us or Our Royal Family, and excepting Coats of Arms upon other Coaches) upon such Pains and Penalties to be inflicted upon the offenders, as are by Our Laws and Statutes in such case provided. Given at Our Court at Whitehall the Twentieth day of November 1661. in the Thirteenth year of Our Reign. GOD SAVE THE KING.
