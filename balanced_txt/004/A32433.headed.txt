By the King. A PROCLAMATION For Discovery of Robberies and Burglaries, and for a Reward to the Discoverers. CHARLES R. WHereas Robberies upon the High-ways, and Burglaries have been more frequent∣ly committed of late, then heretofore, and more audaciously in the open Streets, and other ways, and places, in, and about the Cities of London and Westminster, and Parts adjacent; sometimes near to His Majesties Royal Presence, and Pa∣lace, and to His Courts of Iustice, in affront to Government: Therefore for the better Suppression and Prevention thereof, and Apprehension of Offenders, The Kings most Excellent Majesty (by and with the Advice of His Privy Council) doth hereby straitly Charge and Command all Sheriffs, Iustices of the Peace, Maiors, Bailiffs, Constables, Head-burroughs, Tythingmen, and other Officers and Ministers to whom it doth or shall appertain, to take care, That the Statute of Winchester, made in the Thirteenth year of the Reign of King Edward the First, for Hue and Cries, and fresh Suit to be made after Felons and Robbers, from Town to Town, and from Countrey to Countrey, be duly observed with all dili∣gence. For which purpose, and to the end His People, for avoiding the Penalties to the contrary, may use their utmost endeavors for Apprehending the Offenders, His Majesty hath thought fit here∣by
to make known and publish, That by the said Statute of Winchester, the Inhabitants of the Countrey where the Robberies are done, are to be answerable for the Robbery, and also for the damage to the parties robbed, if the Offenders be not apprehended within the space of Forty days; And by other Laws and Statutes for deterring Offenders, they are deprived of the benefit of Clergy, in case of Robberies on the High-ways, and Burglaries, and the party robbed, for his en∣couragement to make resistance, is not to forfeit any thing, if he kill the Robber. And for the more effectual Discovery and Prosecution of the said Offenders, His said Majesty is graciously plea∣sed, and hereby doth promise to Pardon all such person and persons who have been Partakers, or guilty in committing any Robberies on the High-way, Burglaries, or other Thefts, that shall within One year, from the date of this Proclamation, discover his, or their Fellow-Offenders, or any of them, so as to cause them to be apprehended. And furthermore, His said Majesty is gra∣ciously pleased, and doth hereby declare, That such person or persons, as well the said Partakers guilty of the Offences, as all and every other person and persons, who shall at any time, within One year, now next ensuing, as to Offences already done and past, and for the future within One year after the Offences committed, discover to any Iustice of Peace, or any other Officer of Iustice, any person that hath committed, or shall commit any Robbery on the High-way, or Burglary, and shall apprehend, or cause to be apprehended such Offender, shall within Fifteen days after Convicti∣on of such Offender so apprehended upon such Discovery, have a Reward of Ten pounds for every such Offender so apprehended and convicted. And all and every Sheriff and Sheriffs of the re∣spective Counties or Sheriff-wicks, where such Conviction shall be had, are hereby required upon the Certificate of the Iudge, or under the hand of Two or more Iustices of the Peace, before whom such Conviction shall be had, to pay unto such person or persons who shall discover and appre∣hend such Offender, or upon whose Discovery such Offenders shall be apprehended, the said Reward of Ten pounds, within the time aforesaid, for every Offender so apprehended and convicted, out of the Publick Moneys received by him in that County, which shall be allowed unto him upon his ac∣compt in His Majesties Exchequer: And for allowance whereof, this Proclamation shall be a suffi∣cient Warrant. Given at His Majesties Court at Whitehal the Thirtieth day of December, in the Thir∣teenth year of His Majesties Reign. God save the King.
