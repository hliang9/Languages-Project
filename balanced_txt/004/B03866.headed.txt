His Majesties MOST GRACIOUS SPEECH To both Houses of PARLIAMENT, On Friday the 22th. of May, 1685. My Lords and Gentlemen, AFter it pleased Almighty God to take to his Mercy, the Late King, my Dearest Brother, and to bring Me to the Peaceable Possession of the Throne of My Ancestors; I immediately Resolved to Call a Parliament, as the best Means to Settle every Thing upon those Foundations that may make my Reign both Easie and Happy to you, towards which I am Disposed to Contribute all that is Fit for Me to do; What I said to My Privy Council at My first Coming there, I am desi∣rous to Renew to you; Wherein I fully Declared My Opinion concern∣ing the Principles of the Church of England, whose Members have shewed themselves so Eminently Loyal in the Worst of Times, In Defence of my Father, and Support of My Brother, of Blessed Memory, That I will always take Care to Defend and Support it: I will make it My Endeavour to Preserve this Government both in Church and State, as it is now by Law Established; and as I will never Depart from the Just Rights and Prerogative of the Crown, So I will never Invade any Mans Property; And you may be sure, That having heretofore Ventured My Life in the Defence of this Nation, I shall still Go as far as any Man in Preserving it in all it's Just Rights and Liberties. And having Given you this Assurance concerning the Care I will have of your Religion and Property, which I have chosen to do in the same Words I used at My first Coming to the Crown, the better to Evidence to you That I Spoke Them not by chance, and consequently, That you may the more Firmly Rely upon a Promise so Solemnly Made; I cannot Doubt that I shall fail of Sutable Returns from you, with all imaginable Duty and
Kindness on your Part, and particularly, In what relates to the Settling of my Revenue, and Continuing it during My Life, as it was in the Time of the King My Brother: I might Use many Arguments to En∣force this Demand, from the Benefit of Trade, The Support of the Na∣vy, The Necessity of the Crown, and the Well-being of the Govern∣ment it self, which I must not suffer to be Precarious; But I am confi∣dent, your own Consideration of what is Just and Reasonable, will Sug∣gest to you whatsoever might be Enlarged upon this Occasion. There is one Popular Argument, which I foresee may be used against what I Ask of you, from the Inclination Men may have for frequent Parliaments, which some may think would be the best Secured, by Feeding Me from Time to Time, by such Proportions as they shall think convenient; And this Argument, It being the First Time I Speak to you from the Throne, I will answer Once for All: That this would be a very improper Method to Take with Me, and, That the best Way to Engage Me to Meet you Often is, Always to Use Me well; I Expect therefore, That you will Comply with Me in what I have Desired, and, That you will Do it Speedily, That this may be a short Session, and that We may Meet again to all Our Satisfactions. My Lords and Gentlemen, I must acquaint you, That I have had News this Morning from Scot∣land, that Argile is Landed in the West High-Lands, with the Men he brought with him from Holland, and that there are two Declarations Published, one in the Name of all those in Arms there, the other in his own; it would be too long for Me to Repeat the Substance of them, it is sufficient to tell you I am Charged with Usurpation and Tyranny: The shorter of them I have Directed to be forthwith Communicated to you; I will take the best Care I can that this Declaration of their own Treason and Rebellion may meet with the Reward it deserves, and I will not doubt but that you all will be the more Zealous to Support the Government, and give Me My Revenue, as I have Desired it without Delay. FINIS.
