A new Plot against Hull. Or, A new Designe to take Hull, begun and prosecuted by a company of Factious spirits, but most auspiciously prevented. SInce his Majesties going downe to Yorke, many troubles and discontents have molested that part of the Kingdome, from which the Towne of Hull hath not been exempted: Since the first and second attempt made against it, there was lately a new De∣signe hatcht and set on foot to take the same, where∣by the malignant party may the better assert their purposes, and bring to ruine the quiet estate of the whole Kingdome: Now lately a new mischiefe was set on foot, being begun by the encouragement and countenance of some factious and disquiet spirits This design was to have surprized the Towne, to have taken possession thereof, and have gained all into their owne possession but before they could accom∣plish their wicked purposes, their intentions were discovered, by which meanes they did desist from their purpose, so that neither the Plot it self nor the Actors were brought to light, but in good time the Town was secured, and we hope the Actors or con∣federates will be found out.
EDENBURGH the 18. of May, 1642. THE Lords of the Privie Councell of the King∣dome of Scotland, in a frequent meeting, ha∣ving according to the importance of matters of so great waight and concernment, maturely and at length considered the severall Declara∣rations, Messages, Answers and Instructions sent unto them from his Mujesty: As also what hath beene represented unto them in the Declaration sent from the Parliament of England, doe finde themselves bound in duty to ac∣knowledge that they esteeme it no small happinesse to receive true and full information from the Fountaine, and not to be left to the middle and wandring streames of private mis-reports, which are ready to mislead such as are apt to follow them from the right understanding of the Truth into the dangerous by-pathes of Iea∣lousies and Errour, the preventing whereof, made the Kingdome in the time of their late Troubles so frequently to declare them∣selves and their intentions both to his Majesty and the Kingdome of England. They doe also receive and imbrace with all humble respect and thankfulnesse from his Majesty, the large and lively expressions of his Royall and Religious Resolution, and care to maintaine and preserve the true Religion, Liberties and Lawes of his Kingdomes, together with right correspondencie betwixt them, it being the true and onely foundation of greatnesse, and glory to himselfe and his Posterity, and of peace and happinesse to his People, for which this whole Kingdome being straightly bound by their common Allegeance, Naturall Obedience, and Nationall Oath, never to be forgotten, will ever most willingly and readily spend their lives and Fortunes, and what is dearest unto them.
They doe in like manner with reciprocall and Brotherly affecti∣on acknowledge the large testimony of the care and zeale of the Parliament of England, to keep a right understanding betwixt the two Nations, which both Pariaments have obliged themselves by solemne Vowes and Protestaion, by all good meanes to preserve, against which, no sinister information or mis-report shal ever make this Kingdome to fall into such mis-construction as may be a vi∣olation of their Vowe and Protestation made in Parliament. But in the middest of their joy and gladnesse, arising upon the Professions and Protestations both of King and parliament, they cannot but professe the unfeigned griefe and great feares, which they have conceived, upon the misunderstanding and so long rising distractions betwixt his Majesty and the Parliament, which unlesse they be speedily removed, can bring forth no other fruits, then the rejoycing and triumph of the common Enemies of our Religion and Peace, and such a world of evils to his Majestie, and his Do∣minions, as they are loth to suffer themselves to thinke upon, and chuse rather to wrap up in silence, wishing that they may be made never more to appeare then to the encouragement of ill-affected persons, and griefe of the soules of all good men to be expressed by words, and therefore on the one part, they are confident that the honourable Houses of Parliament, in their great wisdome and af∣fection, will leave no faire and good meanes unattempted, to in∣duce his Majesty to returne unto them. That there may be a better understanding betwixt him and his People, and they honoured with his Royall power, and strengthe∣ned by his Scepter and Authority, and although they know, that they now will nor should meddle with the publike actions of any other Kingdome then they are called interessed as fellow Sub∣jects under one Head or Monarchy, yet since the Honourable Houses of Parliament have thought meet to draw the practices of the Parliament of Scotland into Example in the point of Declaration, thay are confident that the affection of the Parlia∣ment will leade them also to the practise of this Kingdome, in com∣posing the unhappie Differences betwixt his Majesty and them, and so farre as may consist with the Religion, Liberties and Lawes, in giving his Majesty satisfaction, especially in the tender care of His Royall Person, and of His Princely Greatnesse and Authority, which will be also the most powerfull meanes of setling the great∣ness
and prosperity of that Kingdome, upon the other  the deepe sence of His Majestes trouble, and from the Love and Loyaltie of their hartes, their humble desire is that his Maiesty may be pleased to hearken to the earnest desires and hearty Invitaion of His peoples intreating to his Parliament, which as it is His greatest so it is his best and most unparalleld Counse, that by the brightnes of His Maiesties presence and Countenance all the Clouds of for∣mer Iealousies and feares may be scattered, and mutuall Confidenc may bee revived and His people satisfied, as the onely meanes of Happinesse both of the King and Kingdome, the resolution where upon this Kingdome will also in crease Our hap∣pinesse. And since his Majesty hath been pleased to make knowne unto them his Resolution to goe into Ireland in person, they are bold as his Maiesties loving Subiects and faithfull Counsellours to give their humble opinions, that as thay doe with their hearts acknowlge his Majesties fatherly compassion of the sufferings of his good Subjects by the Rebellion there, his princely endeavours in quickning all meanes that may serve for their reliefe, and for the more speedy and powerfull suppression of the Rebels and delive∣rance of his people, in offering to hazard his Royall person, then which there can be no greater Demonstration of princely care and courage, so as by their naturall affection and by their desire of the preservation of his Majesties person, upon which dependeth the safety of these Kingdomes, constrained in all humility to report that they conceive it to be a matter which requireth more mature Deliberation. Whether his Maiestie shall hazard his owne Royall Person in such a matter, and thereby also put his good Subiects in greate feares for him. Whether the great Affaires and dangerous Distractions of the Kingdome of England, which never did more require his Personall presence, may suffer his Absence at this time. Whether his going in person against such base Rebels be not a descending too low from that high dignity and Royal eminency wherein God hath placed him, as his immediate Vice-gerent, and whether it be not more for his Maiesties Honour and Safety, and for the inward security of his People against their Feares of danger, to his Maiesties person, and their outward quietnesse against dangers to themselues, to
command such Forces of his willing Subiects to goe in that expedition as by Gods helpe and assistance may be more then sufficient to cruse their Rebellion, and reduce the whole Kingdome to his Maiesties obeience, but concerning this wish and hope that His Maiesty may be pleased to hee and consider of the advice and Councell of his Parliament of ngland, as being more neerely concerned in the matters of Ireland although none be more in their interest in his majesties Royall person. In the end they doe numbly intreat that all meanes may be forborn which may make the breach wider, and the wound deeper, and that no place be given to evill Spi∣rit of Division, which at such times worketh uncessantly, and ra∣ther now that the fairest, the most expression, and compendious way be taken by so wise a King and parliament, as may against all malice and opposition make his majesty and his posterity more glorious, and his Kingdomes more happy then ever for this blessed end and earnestly wished for Conclusion, according to their mani∣fold obligations and duty, they do offer their best indeavours, and for the present have sent the Earle of Lowdon, and Chancellour of the Kingdome, who will give a more full Declaration of their minde and desires.
