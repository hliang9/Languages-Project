The Whiggish Poet's Recanâˆ£tation: With an Account of his Misfortune in his counterfeit Lawyers Gown. When that I in a Lawyers Gown, Was got amongst the Lawyers; I in my chewce was quickly found, I look'd more like a Sawyer. To the Tune of, No Ignoramus Juries now. THis is my Reformation, and perfect Recantation, Which shall appear, both far and near, through all the Land and Nation, No Whining, nor Pining, nor Loyalty declining; But let the Law, keep Whiggs in Awe, and check their damn'd designing, I writ in praise of Tony, in short it was for Mony; But when I see, their Treachery, I'de be no more their Crony. No whining, nor pining, &c. I was a noble Spender, when Tony liv'd in Splendor, I us'd to write, The Whiggs delight; to me much Fame did render. No whining, nor pining, &c And I was mighty handy, in filling out the Brandy; I'de Smoke and funk, till I was drunk, few whiggs could go beyond me. No whining, nor pining, &c. Those days Sir, while they lasted, I had Sack when I ask't it: When I was drunk they sent me home safe in a Porters Basket. No whining, nor pining, &c. When Russel was Arraigned, a Lawyers Gown I gained; I ask'd the Case, to my disgrace, and all my Credit stained. No whining, nor pining, &c. With Lawyers I Converced, but quickly was disgraced; I was undone, and forc'd to run, and dare not stand to face it. No whining, nor pining, &c. Ambition so abounded, and I with shame surrounded: I with my Gown, was tumbled down, and all my Wits confounded. No whining, nor pining, &c. This did eclipse my glory, a sad and dismal Story; The Rabble I, will now defie, and turn a Loyal Tory. No whining, nor pining, &c. God Bless great CHARLES and Jemmy, and all the whole Retinue, With Peace and Love, down from Above, with happy Days and many. No whining, nor pining, nor Loyalty declining; But let the Law, keep Whiggs in Awe, and check their damn'd designing. London, Printed for M. Smelt, in the Year, 1684.
