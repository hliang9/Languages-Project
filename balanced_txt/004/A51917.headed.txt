THE SPEECH OF PATRICK Earl of Marchmont, &c. Lord High Chancellor to the PARLIAMENT OF SCOTLAND, On Tuesday 21. May 1700. My Lords and Gentlemen, OUR Soveraign Lord the KING, who has done so great things for this Nation, as we have good reason ever to rejoyce of, and for which we ought to show our perpetual Gratitude, by a con∣stant Readiness to do His Majesty such Services as will be accep∣table to Him; has so plainly and kindly in His most gracious Letter, expressed his firm Resolution to make it the chief Design of his Reign, to do every thing that may tend to the Advantage and Good of His Subjects, that I need say nothing to perswade you to rest assured of it, and to rely u∣pon it. The Commissioners Grace, whom his constant Fidelity to His Majesty, Zeal for the Good of the Countrey, and His other fit Enduments, have justly In∣duced the King to imploy in the Great and Important Trust of representing His Majesties Royal Person in this Session of Parliament; And who is no doubt upon the mentioned Considerations most acceptable to us all: Have∣ing likeways expressed to you, His Majesties good Resolutions and Intenti∣ons; It seems not necessary for me to add to what you have heard upon that Subject. My part, shall be then earnestly to invite you to the Remembrance and Consideration of the Great and Eminent Danger this Nation was in, as to all its most valuable Interests, when it pleased GOD to put it in the Heart of our KING to appear for our Rescue and Deliverance, likeways of the great Wisdom and Prudence, Conduct and Courage, which have been eminent∣ly shown; The great Labours, Travels and Pains, which have been under∣gone and taken, the great and many Dangers and Hazards which have been encountered by His Majesty, in the Prosecution of His glorious Undertaking for Rescuing and Establishing our Religion, Liberties and Laws. But above all, to invite you to the Remembrance and Consideration of the wonderful Mercies and Goodness of GOD, who has been pleased to show
his favour to this Nation, in raising up for it so great a Deliverer, and in Coun∣tenancing and Supporting Him, and giving Him so happy a Success in His Enterprizes; That these things which seemed to be next to impossible▪ are brought to pass to the unexpressible Joy and Comfort of all good People in the Nation. An universal Peace did terminat that War wherein most part of the Princes and States in Europe were deeply concerned and engaged, one of the greatest, most Bloody and Expensive that ever Europe had seen, and of a long Conti∣nuance, tho' this Nation and its Interests were all at stake in that war; Yet by the wise Conduct of our King, we felt it not much: We were in Peace at Home, no Eenemy to invade our Houses, none to pluck the Morsel from the Mouths of our Children; Nay, not so much as to drive our Cattel from their pasture, excepting that short time, when our own unnatural Countrey∣men, ravaged in, and harased the North of Scotland to the great prejudice in∣deed of these honest hearted Patriots there, who bravely-showed their Zeal and concern for the Support of the happy Settlement then established. I hope to see the Time, and t at it is not for distant, when the Parliament of Scotland will consider the great Losses and Prejudice sustained by their fel∣low Subjects; These worthy Persons who then bore the Burden, and endured the Heat of the Day, and will do it in such a manner, as may convince the Sufferers how willing they would have been, and are, to partake with them in their Losses, as well as they do in their benefites and Advantages. But at this time, it is necessary for us to consider, that tho' we are at peace with Forreign Princes and Powers; Yet the Enmity of a Multitude, Natives of this Kingdom, living in it, and injoying the Protection of the Government; Besides these who are Abroad, is not at an end, they are not reconciled, they are still Designing and Hatching Mischief, and waiting Opportunities to put in Execution. We may justly too take notice of the Breach that is beginning among the Protestant Princes of the North, and of the Warlike Preparations which are made both for Land and Sea, by other Neigbouring Princes and States, which may at least lead us to bethink our selves, and to be so far upon our Guard, as to provide for maintaining that Tranquility within the Kingdom, which we now enjoy. The King's Majesty has told you, that he thinks it necessary for that pur∣pose, that the Forces be provided for; and I am confident that no man who observes well, and considers justly, will differ from his Majesties opinion. My Lords and Gentlemen, I cannot but tell you, that the penetrating Wisdom of our King, has been so manifest in the Course of his Reign, as justly claims a great Deference from you, that the Care he has taken of your most important Interests, and the great Things he has performed for you, do justly claim an intire Trust, and Con∣fidence to be lodged in Him, all the Proof of these which He expects at this time, is what may very well be expected from a Parliament, which all along has e∣videnced so much good Affection to Him, and Gratitude towards Him; Let us not change our way, but with honest and generous Minds, Heartily, Rea∣dily and Unanimously go in to, and joyn with the Sentiments of our Prince to His Satisfaction and Comfort, when the doing it will so much tend to our own Safety, Peace and Advantage: Now is the time, and if we lay not hold u∣pon the Occasion, we will certainly repent it, and perhaps when it is too late, which I hope GOD in His Goodness shall prevent, by guiding your Hearts and blessing your Endeavours.
