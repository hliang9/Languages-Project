OF THE PRAISE, Vertue, and Efficacie of the PSALMES. THe Kingly Prophet Dauid, Psal. 47. 6. saith; O sing prai∣ses, sing praises vnto our God, O sing praises, sing prai∣ses vnto our King: Sing praises with vnderstanding. Againe, Psal. 95. 2. Let vs shew our selues glad in him with Psalmes. And good reason haue we to sing chearefully vnto God, for the Angels ioyne their presence & con∣gratulation with the singers deuotion, as the same Psalmist singeth, Psal. 138. In conspectu angelorum psallam tibi; Euen before the Gods will I sing praise vnto thee: Wherefore we ought diligently to take heed, that by ou idlenesse, negligence, and want of practise, wee cause not the Angels to depart from vs. And indeed there is no mor∣tall man which can expresse in words, or conceiue in thought, the vertues of the Psalmes, and the praises of the Lord, if with a pure and serious attention of the heart they shall be performed as they ought to be. In the Psalmes, are described the rewards of good, the punish∣ments of euil men, the rudiments of beginners, the progresse of proficients, and consummation of perfect men: The singing of Psalmes (as say the Doctors) comforteth the sor∣rowfull, pacifieth the angry, strengtheneth the weake, humbleth the proud, gladdeth the humble, stirres vp the flow, reconcileth enemies, lifteth vp the heart to heauenly things, and vniteth the Creature to his Creator, for whatsoeuer is in the Psalmes, condu∣ceth to the edification, benefit, and consolation of mankinde. Wouldst thou make a confession, and repent thee of thy sinnes? Then sing with remorse and humility the seauen penitential Psalms
of David, and thou shalt feele the sweet mercy of God and thy minde refreshed with spirituall ioy. Wouldst thou pray? Then poure forth thy soule in the Psalmes 25. 54. 67. 70▪ 72. 86. 143. For the soule of man cannot either feelingly expresse his misery, tribulation and anguish of temptati∣on, or more powerfully call vpon the mercy of God, then in these Psalmes. Wouldst thou praise the Maiestie of God, or giue him thankes for all his benefits? then sing the 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 111, 113, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150. If thou be so farre afflicted with outward and inward temptati∣ons, that thou seemest to be forsaken, then sing heartily the 22. 64. 69. Psalmes. If this present life be tedious vnto thee, and that with an ardent desire thou waitest to see God, then sing the 42, 63, 84. Psalmes. If thou finde thy selfe quite deiected, and as it were forlorne in trouble, then with compunction of heart sing the 13, 31, 44, 54, 56. Psalmes, and when thou hast found ease and rest vnto thy soule, O sing to the praise of God, the 30, 34, 103, 104. Psalmes, and al∣wayes whether in the time of aduersity, or prosperity, sing out the song of the three Children, wherein euery creature is inuited to praise God. But dost thou desire to exercise thy selfe in the diuine praises and precepts of the Lord? Content thy selfe then and sing the 119. Psalme, wherein although euen to the end of thy life thou shalt haue sought and searcht all that thou canst, yet shalt thou neuer perfect∣ly vnderstand the vertues & excellencies, or reach vnto the heights and depths which are comprehended in it: for hardly is there a verse in that whole Psalme wherein is not mention made of Gods Law, Commandements, Testimonies and Precepts. In a word, he that would giue these heauenly Hymnes their due, had need to compose a Psalme in praise of the Psalmes, that so the deuout and ioyfull soule might with looking vp vnto God, reflect vpon its own worke, and transport it selfe vnto the quire of Angels and Saints, whose perpetuall taske is to sing their concording parts without pause, redoubling and descanting; Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God of Hosts. And if Vocall Musicke be not full enough, let the In∣strumentall be added, Reuelat. 15. 2. They haue in their hands the Harps of God, & sing the song of Moses, and the song of the Lambe, saying, Great and meruaius are thy workes Lord God Almighty. Amen.

TO ALL THAT HAVE Skill, or Will vnto Sacred Musicke, I wish CONCORD among them∣selues, with GOD, and with their owne CONSCIENCES. HArmonicall Brthren, I haue here vnderta∣ken with no small labour, and charge, to bring the Tunes of the Psalmes, Hymnes Euan∣gelicall, and Songs Spirituall, (as they are vsually sung throughout Great Britaine) into one entire volume; which are so Composed, for the most part, that the vnskilfull may with little practice, be enabled to sing them in parts, after a plausible manner. In my opinion, 'tis too Laborious a taske for any Man to study the attainement of the Hebrew Musicall Accents; For the Tunes vsed in Dauids Time, are too farre remo∣ued from our vnderstanding. For albeit the Hebrew Mu∣sicall Characters are placed sometimes aboue the Letter, sometimes beneath, yet the knowledge of what was signi∣fied by those Notes and Characters, was onely continued by Tradition, and is now vtterly lost, though many at sun∣dry times (as appeareth by their writings) haue gone about to reuiue it: But hauing no better subiect to worke vpon, then their owne weake coniectures, they haue but a little preuailed. I finde yet that the Characters now vsed in the Rushian Church, (who had their skill in Musicke from
the Graecians) though they differ in the placing, (because those of the Hebrewes are both aboue and beneath the Letter, these onely aboue) yet they partly resemble one another in the forme. Againe, I finde by sundry Manuscripts, that the Latine Church, as well in the forme of their Characters, as like∣wise in the placing of them, did participate of both. For first, according to the manner of the Hebrewes, they placed their Notes both aboue and beneath the Letter. After∣wards they vsed one line aboue the Letter, and placed their Notes both aboue and beneath the line, and that with a Geometricall distance, as the ascent and descent of the sounds did require. In processe of time (as all things are brought to their per∣fection by degrees) they came to two lines, then to three. And Gudo Aretinus, a learned man (whom Histories re∣port to haue liued in the time of Henry the 2. Emperour, in the yeare of our LORD, 1018.) was the first that inuen∣ted the vniforme of the Scale, (which we terme Gamvt) and brought in the foure lines, which was and onely is now vsed in the Church for Phonaskes, distinguished by the Gregorian, Ambrosian, and Perigrine Tones, compre∣hended in the distance of a Diatessaron or a Diapente, viz. a fourth or a fifth, or the Harmonicall proportions of sesqui tertia and sesquialtera: and by degrees it came to the distance of a Diapason, which is an eight, and a Du∣ple proportion; in which three proportions, all Simple and Compound Harmony consisteth, by the Plagall and Authenticke diuision of the Tones and Tropes. The which Phonaskes are explained by the Tenor part, being the Fa∣burden or Playn-song of the Psalmes, Anthems, and Re∣sponces vsually sung in the Church in Prose, and Hymnes
that were Composed in Verse and Meeter. The fiue lines are vsed for Symphonaskes or Parts Compounded of 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. voyces, &c. The sixe lines are vsed for Instrumentall Musicke, as Organs, Harpes, Lutes, &c. But whatsoeuer the Tunes were in Dauids time, there is no question but they were concordant and Harmonious, which could not be, had they not beene diuided in parts. For if ye looke into 1 Chro. chap. 15. 16. verse, yee shall see how the Prophet Dauid at the Reduction of the Arke, as likewise Salomon his Sonne, at the Dedication of the Temple, 2 Chro. chap. 6. 31. verse, distinguished all their Musicke in parts, and appointed such to be Masters and Ouer-seers of it, as were most eminent for their know∣ledge in that kinde; as Chenaniah the chiefe Leuite, to haue the chiefe place, which was to be Master of the Song. An office which consisted not onely in the directi∣on of the Quire, but likewise in the trayning vp of others to sing, that there might be still a supply of able persons for that seruice: Asaph the next, and so Heman his Bro∣ther, likewise Ieduthun and Ethan, all of them the most renowned chanters of those Times, and such as successiuely in one anothers absence, were to direct the due performance of that charge, so that not onely the voyce of the Singers, but likewise the sound of the Instruments agreed so well to∣gether, that they seemed to bee but one Sound, and one Voyce. Neither was this method confined onely to the Old Te∣stament, but sanctified to the Church of Christ by the pre∣scription of the holy Apostle S. Paul, Col. 3. verse 16. Let the word of God dwell plenteously in you, in all wise∣dome, teaching and admonishing your owne selues,
in Psalmes, Hymnes and Spirituall songs, singing with a Grace to the Lord in your hearts. I haue therefore endeauoured for the fitting of euery Heart to that Psalme, which it shall most affect, to place speciall Tunes, proper to the nature of each Psalme, (not imitating Art so much, as the naturall inclination, but ioy∣ning one with another,) and am bold to admonish the Sin∣gers that they obserue three Rules. 1 That Psalmes of Tribulation be sung with a low voyce and long measure, Psal. 9. 32. 38. 51. 102. 130. 143. &c. 2 That Psalmes of Thankesgiuing be sung with a voyce indifferent, neither too loud, nor too soft, and with a measure neither too swift nor too slow, Psal. 18. 23. 27. 30. 31. 46. 48. 66. 81. 104. 105. 111. 118. 122. 124. 126. 138. 144 145. 146. 3 That Psalmes of Reioycing be sung with a loude voyce, a swift and iocund measure, Psal. 33. 34. 47. 84. 95. 96. 98. 99. 108. 113. 117. 135. 136. 145. 147. 148. 150. In all which, the obseruing of Time, Tune, and Eare, will produce a perfect Harmony. Accept kindely, what I haue laboured earnestly, and vse it to thy comfort. Thus I end, humbly wishing to all true Christian hearts, that sweet consolation, in singing prayses vnto God here vpon Earth, as may bring vs here∣after, to beare a part with the Quire of Angels in the Heauens. Your well according, and best wishing Brother, Tho. Rauenscroft.

WHat man soeuer he be that saluation vvill attaine: The Catho- like beliefe he must before all things retaine. VVhich faith vnlesse he holy keepe, and vndefiledly, vvithout all doubt eternally he shall be sure to die. The Catholike beliefe is this, that God vve vvorship one In trinitie, and Trinitie in Vnitie alone. So as vve neither doe confound the persons of the three: Nor yet the substance vvhole of one in sunder parted be. One person of the Father is, another of the Sonne, Another person proper of the holy Ghost alone. Of Father, Sonne and holy Ghost, but one the God-head is: Like glory, coeternall eke the maiestie likevvise. Such as the Father is, such is the Sonne in each degree: And such also vve doe beleeue the holy Ghost to be. Vncreate is the Father, and vncreate is the Sonne: The holy Ghost vncreate, so vncreate is each one. Incomprehensible Father is, incomprehensible Sonne: And comprehensible also is the holy Ghost of none. The Father is eternall and the Sonne eternall so: And in like sort eternall is the holy Ghost also. And yet though vve beleeue that each of these eternall be: Yet there but one eternall is, and not eternals three. As ne incomprehensible vve, ne yet vncreate three: But one incomprehensible one vncreate hold to be. Almighty so the Father is, the Sonne almighty so: And in like sort almighty is the holy Ghost also. And albeit that euery one of these Almighty be: Yet there but one Almighty is, and not almighties three. The Father God is, God the Sonne, God holy Ghost also: Yet there are not three Gods at all, but one God and no moe. So likevvise Lord the Father is, and Lord also the Sonne: And Lord also the holy Ghost, yet are there not three Lords but one. For as vve are compeld to grant by Christian veitie: Each of the persons by himselfe, both God and man to be. So Catholike religion forbiddeth vs alvvay, That eyther Gods be three, or that there Lords be three to say. Of none the Father is, ne made, ne create, nor begot: The sonne is of the Father, not create ne made, but got. The holy Ghost is of them both, the Father and the Sonne: Ne made, ne create, not begot, but doth proceede alone. So vve one Father hold, not three, one Sonne also not three: One holy Ghost alone, and not three holy Ghosts to be. None in this Trinitie before nor after other is: Ne greater any then the rest, ne lesser be likevvise. But euery one among themselues, of all the persons three: Together coeternall all, and all coequall be. So Vnitie in Trinitie, as said it is before: And Trinitie in Vnitie in all things vve adore. Therefore vvhat man soeuer that saluation vvill attaine: This faith touching the Trinitie, of force he must retaine. And needfull to eternall life it is that euery vvight Of the incarnation of Christ, our Lord beleeue aright. For this the ight faith is, that vve beleeue and eke doe knovv, That Christ our Lord the Sonne of God is God and man also. God of his Fathers substance, got before the vvorld began, And of his mothers substance borne in vvorld a very man. Both perfect God and perfect man, in one, one Iesus Christ: That doth of reasonable soule and humane flesh subsist Touching his God-head, equall vvith his father God is hee: Touching his man-hood lovver then his Father in degree. VVho though he be both very God, and very man also▪ Yet is he but one Christ alone, and is not persons tvvo. One not by turning of God-head into the flesh of man: But by taking man-hood to God, this being one began. All one, not by confounding of the substance into one: But onely by the vnitie that is of one person. For as the reasonable soule and flesh but one man is: So in one person God and man, is but one Christ likevvise.
VVho suffered for to saue as all, to hell he did descend: The third day rose againe from death, to heauen he did ascend, He sits at the right hand of God, th' Almighty Father there: From thence to iudge the quick & dead, againe he shall retire. At vvhose returne all men shall rise vvith bodies nevv restorde: And of their ovvn vvorks they shall giue account vnto the Lord. And they into eternall life shall goe that haue done vvell: VVho haue done ill, shall goe into eternall fire to dvvell. This is the Catholike beliefe, vvho doth not faithfully Beleeue the same, vvithout all doubt he saued cannot be. ¶To Father, Sonne, and holy Ghost, all glory be therefore: As in beginning vvas is novv, and shall be euermore.

37 Marke & behold the perfect man, bovv God doth him increase: For the iust man shall haue at length, great ioy vvith rest and peace. 38 As for transgressors, vvoe to them, destroyde they shall all be: God vvill cut off their budding race, and rich posteritie: But the saluation of the iust, doth come from God aboue: VVho in their trouble sends them aide, of his meere grace and loue. 40 God doth them help, saue & deliuer, from levvd men and vniust: And still vvill saue them vvhilst that they in him doe put their trust.

ALL people hearken and giue eare to that that I shall tell Both high and lovv, both rich and poore, that in the vvorld doe dvvell. 3 For vvhy my mouth shal make discourse of many things right vvise: In vnderstanding shall my heart his study exercise. 4 I vvill incline mine eares to knovv thy parables so darke: And open all my doubtfull speech, in meeter on my Harp. 5 VVhy should I feare afflictions, or any carefull toyle: Or else my foes vvhich at my heeles, are prest my life to spolye? 6 For as for such as riches haue, vvherein their trust is most: And they vvhich of their treasures great themselues doe brag and boast. 7 There is not one of them that can his brothers death redeeme: Or that can giue a price to God, sufficient for him. 8 It is too great a price to pay, none can thereto attaine: 9 Or that he might his life prolong, or not in graue remaine: 10 They see vvise men as vvell as fooles, subiect vnto deaths hands: And being dead, strangers possesse their goods, their rents, their lands. 11 Their care is to build houses faire, and to determine sure: To make their name right great on earth for euer to indure. 12 Yet shall no man alvvay enioy his honour, vvealth, and rest: But shall at length taste of deaths cup▪ as vvell as the brute beast. The second part. 13 And though they try their foolish thoughts to be most levvd and vaine: Their children eke approue their talke, and in like sinne remaine. 14 As sheepe vnto the fold are brought, so shall they into graue: Death shall them eate, and in that day the iust shall Lordship haue. 15 Their image and their royall port, shall fade and quite decay? VVhen as from house to pit they passe, vvith vvoe and vveale avvay. 16 But surely God vvill preserue me from death and endlesse paine: Because he vvill of his good grace, my soule receiue againe. 17 If any man vvaxe vvondrous rich, feare not I say therefore: Although the glory of his house encreaseth more and more. 18 For vvhen he dyeth, of all these things nothing shall he receiue: His glory vvill not follovv him, his pompe vvill take her leaue. 19 Yet in this life he takes himselfe the happiest vnder Sunne: And others likevvise flatter him, saying all is vvell done. 20 And presuppose he liue as long as did his fathers old: Yet must he needs at length giue place, and be brought to deaths fold. 21 Thus man to honour God hath calde, yet doth he not consider: But like brute beasts so doth he liue, vvhich turne to dust or povvder.

This hill of Sion God doth loue, and there vvill dvvell for euer. 17 Gods army is tvvo millions of vvarriours good and strong: The Lord also in Sinai is present them among. 18 Thou didst O Lord ascend on hye, and captiue ledst them all: VVhich in times past thy chosen flocke, in prison kept and thrall. 19 Thou madest them tribute for to pay, and such as did repine. Thou didst subdue, that they might dvvel in thy Temple diuine. 20 Novv praised be the Lord, for that he poures on vs such grace: From day to day he is the God of our health and solace.

Yet more and more they did desire to serue their lusts and vvils. 30 But as the meat vvas in their mouths, his vvrath vpon them fell, 31 And slevv the flovver of all their youth and choise of Israel. 32 Yet fell they to their vvonted sinne, and still they did him grieue: For all the vvonders that be vvrought, they vvould not him belieue. 33 Their dayes therefore he shortened, and made their honour vaine: Their yeeres did vvaste and passe avvay vvith terror and vvith paine. 34 But euer vvhen he plagued them, they sought him by and by: Remembring that he vvas their strength, their help, and God most hie. 35 Though in their mouthes they did but glose and flatter vvith the Lord: And vvith their tongues, & in their harts dissembled euery vvord.

Hovv did they stir and moue the Lord to plague them vvith his stroke? 41 Yet did they turne againe to sinne, and tempted God eftsoone, Prescribing to the holy Lord vvhat things they vvould haue done. 42 Not thinking of his hand and povver, no of the day vvhen he Deliuered them out of the hands of the fierce enemy. 43 Nor ovv he vvrought his miracles, as they themselues behld In Egypt, and the vvonders that he did in Zoan field. 44 Nor hovv he turned by his povver, their vvaters into bloud: That no man might receiue his drinke at riuer or at floud. 45 Nor hovv he sent them svvarmes of Flyes vvhich did them fore annoy: And fild their country full of Frogs, vvhich did their land destroy. The fift part. 46 Nor hovv he did commit their fruits vnto the Caterpiller: And all the labour of their hands he gaue to the Grashopper. 47 VVith hailstones he destroid their vines so that they vvere all lost: And not so much as vvilde Fig-trees▪ but he consum'd vvith frost. 48 And yet vvith hailstones once againe the Lord their cattell smoe: And all their flocks & heards likevvise, vvith thunderbolts full hot. 49 He cast vpon them in his ire, and in his fury strong Displeasure, vvrath ad euill spirits to trouble them among. 50 Then to his vvrath he made a vvay, and spared not the least: But gaue vnto the pestilence, the man and eke the beast. 51 He strake also the first borne all that vp in Egypt came: And all the chiefe of men and beasts vvithin the tents of Ham. 52 But as for all his ovvne deare folke, he did preserue and keepe, And carried them through vvildernesse▪ euen like a flocke of sheepe. 53 VVithout all feare both safe & sound he brought them out of thrall: VVhereas theis foes vvith rage of sea vvere ouervvhelmed all. 54 And brought them out into the coasts of his ovvne holy land: Euen to the mount vvhich he had got by his strong arme and hand. 55 And there cast out the heathen folke, and did their land diuide: And in their tents he set the tribes of Israel to abide. 56 Yet for all this, their God most hye they stird and tempted still: And vvould not keepe his testament, nor yet obey his vvill. 57 But as their fathers turned backe, euen so they vvent astray: Much like a bovv that vvould not bend, but slip and start avvay.

The fourth part. 26 His faithfull seruant Moses then, and Aaron whom he chose: He did command to goe to them, his message to disclose. 27 The wondrous message of hi signes amongst them they did shew: And wonders in the land of Ham then did they worke also. 28 Darknesse he sent, and made it darke, in stead of brighter day: 29 And vnto his commission they did not disobey. 30 He turn'd their waters into bloud, he did their fishes slay: Their land brought frogges, euen in the place where their King Pharaoh lay. 31 He spke, and at his voice there came great swannes of noysome flies: And all the quarters of their land were fild with crawling lice. 32 He gaue them cold and stony haile in stead of milder raine: And fiery flames within their land, he sent vnto their paine. 33 He smote the vines and all the trees whereon their figs did grow: And all the trees within their coasts downe did he ouerthrow. 34 He snake, then Caterpillers did and Grashoppers abound: 35 Which eat the grasse in all their land and fruit of all their ground. The fift part. 36 The first begotten in the land eke daily did he inite: Yea, the beginning and first fruit of all their strength and might. 37 With gold and siluer he them brought from Egypt land to passe: And in the number of the Tribes no feeble one there was. 38 Egypt was glad and ioyfull then, when they did thence depart: For terrour and the feare of them was fallen vpon their heart. 39 To shroude them from the parching heate a cloud he did display: And fire he sent to giue them light, when night had hid the day. 40 They asked and he caused Quailes to raine at their request: And fully with the bread of heauen their hunger he represt. 41 He opened then the stony rockes and water gushed out▪ And in the dry and parched ground like riuers ran about. 42 For of his holy couenant aye mindfull was he tho: Which to his seruant Abraham he plighted long agoe. 43 He brought his people forth with mith and his elect with ioy: Out of the cruell land where they had liu'd in great annoy. 44 And of the heathen men he gaue to them the fruitfull land: The labours of the people eke they tooke into theer hand. 45 That they his holy statutes might obserue for euermore: And faithfully obay his lawes, praise ye the Lord therefore.

PRayse yee the Lord, for he is good, his mercy dures for aye: Who can expresse his noble acts, or all his praise display? 3 They blessed are that iudgement keepe, and iustly doe alway: With fauour of thy people Lord, remember me I pray, 4 And with thy sauing health, O Lord, vouchsafe to visit me: That I the great felicitie of thine elect may see. 5 And with thy peoples ioy I may a ioyfull mind possesse: And may with thine inheritance a glorying heart expresse. 6 Both we and eke our fathers all haue sinned euery one▪ We haue committed wickednesse, and lewdly we haue done. 7 The wonders great which thou O Lord, hast done in Egypt land: Our fathers though they saw them all yet did not vnderstand. Nor yet thy mercies multieude did keepe in thankful mind: But at the sea▪ yea, the red sea, rehelled most vnkind. 8 Neuerthelesse he saued them for honour of his name: That he might make his power knowne and spread abroad his fame. 9 The red sea he did then rebuke, and forthwith it was dride: And as in wildernesse, so through the deepe he did them guide. 10 He sau'd them from the cruell hand of their despitefull foe: And from the enemies hand he did deuer them also. The second part. 11 The Waters their oppressous whelmd, not one was left aliue: 12 Then they beleeu'd his words & praise in song they did him giue. 13 But by and by vnthankfully his words they cleane forgat: And for his counsell and his la they did neglect to waite. 14 But usted in the wildernesse with fond and greedie lust: And in the desart tempted God, the stay of all their trust. 15 And then their wanton minds defire he suffered them to haue: But wasting leannese therewithall into their soules he gaue. 16 Then when they lodged in their tent, at Moses they did gutch: Aaron the holy of the Lord so did they enuy much. 17 Therefore the earth did open wide, and Dathan did deuoure: And all Abirams company did couer in that houre. 18 In their assemblies kindled was the hot consuming fire: And wasting flame did the burne vp the wicked in his ire. 19 Vpon the hill of Horeb they an Idoll cafe did frame: And there the molten Image they did worship of the same. 20 Into the likenesse of a calfe that feedeth on the grasse: Thus they their glory turnde, and all their honour did deface. 21 And God their onely Sauiour vnkindly they forgot: Which many great and mightie thing in Egypr land had wrought. The third part. 22 And in the land of Ham for them most wondrous things had done: And by the red sea dreadfull things performed long agone. 23 Therefore for their so shewing them forgetfull and vnkind, To bring destruction on them all he purposde in his minde. Had not his chosen Moses stood before him in the breake, To turne his wrath lest he on them with slaughter should him wreake. 24 They did despise the pleasant land that he behight to giue: Yea, and the words that he had spoke they did no whit beleeue. 25 But in their tents with grudging heart, they wickediy repinde: Nor to the voice of God the Lord they gaue an hearkening mind, 26 Therefore against them lifted he his strong reuenging hand Them to destroy in wildernesse, ere they should see the land. 27 And to destroy their seed among the Nations with his rod: And through the countries of the world to scatter them abroad. 28 To Baal Peor then they did adioyne themselues also: And ate the offerings of the dead, so they forsooke him tho. 29 Thus with their owne inuentions his wrath they did prouoke: And in his so inkindled wrath, the plague vpon them broke, 30 But Phines stood vp with zeale the sinners vile to slay: And iudgement he did execute, and then the plague did stay.

His lips spake vnaduisedly, his feruour was so great. 34 Nor as the Lord commanded them they lue the people tho. But were among the heathen mixt, and learn'd their workes also. 36 And did their Idols serue, which were their ruine and decay: 37 To fiends their sons and daughters they did offer vp and slay: 38 Yea, with vnkindly murdering knife the guiltlesse bloud they spilt: Yea, their owne sons & daughters bloud without all cause of guilt. Whom they to Canaan Idols then offred with wicked hand: And so with bloud of innocents defiled was their land. 39 Thus were they stained with the worke▪ of their owne filthy way: And with their owne inuentions a whoring they did stray. 40 Therefore against his people was the Lords wrath kindled sore: And euen his owne inheritance therefore he did abhorre▪ 41 Into the hands of heathen men he gaue them for a pray: And made their foes their Lords, whom they
wr forced to obey. The fifth part. 42 Yea, and their hatefull enemie opprest them in the lad: And they were humbly made to stoope as subiect to their hand: 43 Full oftentimes from thrall had hee dliuered them before: with their counsels they to wrath prouokt him euermore. Therefore they by their wickednesse were brought full low to he: 44 Yet when he saw them in distresse, he heakned to their cry. 45 He cald to minde his couenant, which he them had swore: And by his mercies multitude, repented him therefore. 46 And fauour he them made to find before the sight of those That led them captiue from their land, when earst they were their foes. 47 Saue vs O Lord that art our God, saue vs O Lord we pray: And from among the heathen folke Lord gather vs away. 48 That we may spread the noble prayse of thy most holy name: That we may glory in rhy prayse, and sounding of rhy fame. 49 The Lord the God of Israel be blest for euermore: Let all the people say, Amen: prayse ye the Lord therefore.

GIue thanks vnto the Lord our God, for gracious is he: And that his mercy hath no end all mortall men may see. 2 Such as the Lord redeemed hath, with thanks should prayse his name: And shew how they from foes were freed and how he wrought the same. 3 He gathered them forth of land that lay so farre about: From East to West, from North to South, his hand did finde them out. 4 They wandered in the wildernesse, and strayed from the way: And found no Ctie where to dwell, that serue might for their stay. 5 Whose thirst and hunger was so great in those desarts so voyde: That faintnesse did them sore assault▪ and eke their soule annoid. 6 Then did they cry in their distresse vnto the Lord for ayde: Who did remoue their troublous state according as they prayed. 7 And by that way that was most right he led them like a guide: That they might to a citie goe, and there also abide. 8 Let men therefore before the Lord confesse his kindnesse then: And shew his wonders that he doth before the sonnes of men. 9 For he the empty soule sustaind, whom thirst had made to fant: The hungry soule with goodnesse fed, and did them eke acquaint. 10 Such as doe dwell in darknesse deep, where they of death doe wate: Fast bound to tast such troublous stormes as iron chaines doe threat. The second part. 11 For they against the Lords owne words, they sought for to rebell: Esteeming light his counsels hie, which doe so farre excell. 12 But when he humbled them full low, then they fell downe with griefe: And none was found so much to help, whereby to get reliefe. 13 Then did they cry in their distresse, vnto the Lord for aide: Who did remoue their troublous state, according as they praide. 14 For he from darknes out them brought and from deaths dreadfull shade: Bursting with force the iron bands, which did before them lade. 15 Let men therefore before the Lord confesse his kindnesse then: And shew his wonders that he doth before the sonnes of men. 16 For he threw downe the gates of brasse and brake them with strong hand: The iron bars he smote in two, nothing could him withstand. 17 The foolish folke great plagues doe feele, and cannot from them wend: But heape vp moe to those they haue, because they doe offend. 18 Their soules so much did loath all meat that none they could abide Whereby death had them almost caught, as they full truly tride, 19 Then dd they cry in their distresse vnto the Lord for aide: Who did remoue their troublous state, according as they praide. 20 For he then sent to them his word, which health did soone restore: And brought them from those dangers deepe wherein they were before. The third part. 21 Let men therefore before the Lord, confesse his kindnesse then: And shew the wonders that he doth before the sonnes of men. 22 And let them offer sacrifice with thankes and also feare: And speake of all his wondrous workes, with glad and ioyfull cheere. 23 Such as in ships or brittle Barks, into the Seas descend: Their merchandise through fearefull floud; to compasse and to end.
24 These men are forced to behold the Lords workes what they be: And in the dangerous deepe the same most meruailous they see. 25 For at his word the stormy winde ariseth in a rage: And stirreth vp the singes so as nought can them asswage. 26 Then are they lifted vp so hie, the clouds they seeme to gaine: And plunging downe the depth vntill their soules consume with paine. 27 And like a drunkard to and fro, now here, now there they reele: As men with feare, of wit bereft, or had of sence no feele. 21 Then did they cry in their distresse vnto the Lord for aide: Who did remoue their troublous state according as they prayed. 29 For with his wrath the Lord doth make the sturdie stormes to cease: So that the great waues from their age are brought to rest and peace. 30 Then are men glad when rest is come, which they so much doe craue: And are by him in hauen brought▪ which they so faine would haue. The fourth part. 31 Let men therefore before the Lord confesse his kindnesse then: And shew the wonders that he doth before the sonnes of men. 32 Let them in presence of the folke with praise extoll his name: And where the Elders doe conuent, let them there doe the same. 33 For running flouds to dry desart, he doth oft change and turne: And drieth vp as it were dust the springing well and bourne. 34 A fruitfull land with plesure deckt full barraine he doth make: When on their sins which dwell therein he doth iust vengeance take. 35 Againe the wildernesse full rude, he maketh fruit to beare: With pleasant springs of waters cleere though none before were. 36 Wherein such hungry soules are set, as he doth freely chuse: That they a Citie may them build, to dwell in for their vse. 37 That they may sow their pleasant land, and Vineyards also plant: To yeeld them fruit of such increase, as none may seeme to want. 38 They multiply exceedingly, the Lord doth blesse them so: Who doth also their brute beasts make, by numbers great to grow. 39 But when the faithfull are low brought by the oppressors stout: And minish doe through many plagues, that compasse them about. 40 Then doth he Princes bring to shame which did them sore oppresse: And likewise caused them to ere, within the wildernesse. 41 But yet the poore he raiseth vp, out of his troubles deepe: And oft times doth his traine augment, much like a flocke of sheepe. 42 The righteous shall behold this sight, and also much reioyce▪ Whereas the wicked and peruerse, with griefe shall stop their voice. 53 But who is wise that now full well he may these things record? For certainly such shall perceiue the kindnesse of the Lord. Psalme 108. Tho. Rauens. B. of M. CANTVS.

Why did your tops as trembling Lambs for feare quiuer and quake 7 O earth confesse thy soueraigne Lord, and dread his mighty hand: Before the face of Iacobs God feare ye both sea and land 8 I meane the God which from hard rocks doth cause maine flouds appeare: And from the stony flint did make gush out the fountaines cleare.

But as for me thy hests to know, I will my selfe imploy. 79 Who so with reuerence doe thee feare to me let them retire: And such as doe thy conenants know, and them alone desire. 80 My heart without all wauering, let on thy lawes be bent: That no confusion come to me, whereby I should be shent.

Euen so likewise vnto the end I will continue still. SAMECH. The XV.

Therefore can I as th statutes, loue nothing halfe so well. 120 My flesh alas is taken with feare, as though it were benumbd▪ For when I see thy iudgements, straight I am as one astond. AIN. The XVI.

PE. The XVII.

ZADE. The XVIII.

And as thou hast me iudg'd ere now, so let me life obtaine. 157 Though many men did trouble me, and persecute me sore: Yet from thy lawes I neuer shrunk. nor went awry therefore. 158 And truth it is for griefe I die, when I these traitors see: Because they keepe no whit thy word, nor yet seeke to know thee. 159 Behold for I doe loue thy lawes, with heart most glad and faine: As thou art good and gracious Lord, restore my life againe. 160 What thy word doth decree, must bee and so it hath beene euer: Thy righteous iudgements are also most true, and decay neuer.

Gods famous acts and noble lawes, are iust and perfect all. 173 Streach out thy hand I thee beseech, and speedily me saue: For thy commandements to obserue, chosen O Lord I haue. 174 Of thee alone Lord I craue health for other I know none: And in thy law and nothing else I doe delight alone. 175 Grant mee therefore long dayes to liue thy name to magnifie: And of thy iudgements mercifull, let me thy fauour try. 176 For I was lost and went astray, much like a wandring sheepe: Oh seeke me for I haue not faild thy commandements to keepe.

Therefore when remedie was none to bring vs vnto life: The Sonne of God our flesh he tooke to end our mortall strife, And all the law of God the Lord, he did it full obay: And for our sinnes vpon the crosse, his bloud our debts did pay. And that we should not yet forget what good he to vs wrought: A signe he left our eyes to tell▪ that he our bodies bought. In Bread and Wine here visible vnto our eye and taste: His mercies great thou mast record if that his spirit thou hast. As once the corne did liue and grow, and was cut downe with Sithe: And threshed out with many stripes, out of the huske to driue. And as the mill with violence did teare it out so small: And make it like to earthly dust not sparing it at all. And as the Ouen with fire hot, did close it vp in heate: And all this done that I haue said that it should be our meate. So was the Lord in his ripe age cut downe by cruell death: His soule he gaue to torments great, and yeelded vp his breath. Because that he to vs might be an euerlasting bread: With much reproch and troubles great his life on earth he led. And as the grapes in pleasant time are pressed very sore: And plucked downe when they be ripe, and let to grow no more. Because the iuyce that in them is as comfortable drinke: We should receiue and ioyfull be, when sorrowes make vs shrinke. So Christ his bloud out pressed was with nailes, and eke with speare: The iuyce whereof doth saue all those that rightly doe him feare. And as the cornes by vnitie into one loafe are knit: So is the Lord and his whole Church, though he in heauen sit. As many grapes make but one wine, so should we be but one, In faith and loue in Christ aboue, and vnto Christ alone. Leading a life without all strife, in quiet rest and peace: From enuie and from malice both our hearts and tongues to cease. Which if we doe then shall we shew that we his chosen be: By faith in him to lead a life as alwayes willed he. And that we may so doe indeed, God send vs all his grace: Then after death we shall be with him to haue a place. A Prayer Tho. Rauenscroft B. of M. CANTVS.

Further∣more, that we may in such sort trauell for our bodies and for this present life, that we may haue alwayes a further regard, that is, to the heauenly life, which thou hast pro∣mised to thy children: and in the meane season, that it may please thee to preserue and defend vs both in body and soule, to strengthen vs against all the temptations of the Deuill, and to deliuer vs from all perils and dangers that may happen vnto vs, if we be not defended with thy godly power. And for as much, as to begin well, and not to continue, is nothing: wee beseech thee to receiue vs not onely this day into thy holy protection: but also for the time of our whole life, continuing and increasing in vs daily thy good grace and gifts there∣of, vntill thou shalt bring vs to that hap∣py state, where wee shall fully and for euer
be ioyned vnto thy Sonne Iesus Christ our Sauiour which is the true light of our soules, shining day and night perpetually: and to the end that wee may obtaine such grace at thy hand, vouchsafe (most merci∣full father) to forgiue and forget all our sinnes, which wee (haue heretofore com∣mitted against thee, and for thine infinite mercies sake to pardon the same, as thou hast promised to those that aske of thee with vnfained hearts, for whom as for our selues, wee make our humble petitions vnto thee, in the name of thy Sonne, our Lord and Sauiour Iesus Christ, in such sort as he hath taught vs, saying: Our Father which art, &c. An Euening Prayer. O Lord God. Father euerlasting and full of pitie, we acknowledge and confesse, that wee be not worthy to lift vp our eyes to heauen, much lesse to present our selues before thy diuine maiestie, with confidence that thou wilt heare our prayers and grant our requests, if we consider our owne wret∣ched deseruings. For our consciences doe accuse vs, and our sins witnesse against vs, and wee know that thou art and vpright Iudge, which dost not iustifie the sinners and wicked men, but punishest the faults of such as transgresse thy Commandements. Yet most mercifull Father, since it hath pleased thee to command vs to call vpon thee in all our troubles and aduersities, promising euen then to helpe vs when wee feele our selues, as it were swallowed vp of death and desperation, we vtterly renounce all worldly confidence and trust, and flie to thy soueraigne goodnesse as our onely stay and refuge, beseeching thee not to call to remembrance our manifold sinnes, and wic∣kednesse, whereby we continually prouoke thy wrath and indignation against vs, nei∣ther our negligence, nor our vnkindnesse, which haue neither worthily esteemed, nor in our liues sufficiently expressed the sweet comfort of thy Gospell reuealed vnto vs, but rather to accept the obedience and death of thy Sonne Iesus Christ our Lord, who by offering vp his body in sacrifice once for all, hath made a sufficient recom∣pence for all our sins. Haue mercy therefore vpon vs (O Lord) and forgiue vs our of∣fences, teach vs by thy holy Spirit that we may rightly weigh them and earnestly re∣pent vs for the same: And so much the rather (O Lord our God) because that the reprobate, and such as thou hast forsaken cannot prayse thee nor call vpon thy name: but the repenting heart, the sorrowfull mind, the conscience oppressed, hungring and thirsting for thy grace, shall euer set forth thy prayse and glory. And albeit w be but wormes and dust, yet thou art our Creatour, and wee bee the worke of thy hands, yea thou art our Father, and we thy children, thou art our shepheard and wee thy flocke, thou art our Redeemer and wee thy people, whom thou hast deerly bought, thou art our God, and we are thine inheri∣tance. Correct vs not therefore in thine anger (O Lord our God) neither according to our deserts doe thou punish vs, but mer∣cifully chastise vs with a fatherly affection, that all the world may know, that at what time soeuer a sinner doth repent him of his sinne from the bottome of his heart, thou wilt put away all his wickednesse out of thy remembrance, as thou hast promised by thy holy Prophet. Finally, forasmuch, as it hath pleased thee to make the night for man to rest in, as thou hast ordained him the day to trauell, grant O deere Fa∣ther, that wee may so take our bodily rest, that our soules may continually watch for the time that our Lord Iesus Christ shall appeare for our full deliuerance out of this mortall lfe, and in the meane season, that wee bee not ouercome by any fantasies, dreames, or other temptations, but may fully set our mindes vpon thee, loue thee, feare thee, and rest in thee, in such sort that our very sleepe also may be to the glory of thy holy Name. Furthermore, that our sleepe be not excessiue or ouermuch, after the insatiable desire of the flesh, but onely sufficient to content our weake nature, that wee may the better bee disposed to liue in all godly conuersation, to the glory of thy holy Name, and profit of our brethren, through Iesus Christ our Lord, in whose Name we make our humble petitions vnto thee, as hee hath taught vs, saying: Our Father, &c. A Prayer for true repentance. MOst gracious God, and mercifull Fa∣ther of our Sauiour Iesus Christ, because I haue sinned and done wicked∣ly▪ and through thy goodnesse haue recei∣ued a desire of Repentance, whereunto this thy long-suffering doth draw my hard heart, I beseech thee for thy great mer∣cies sake in Christ, to worke the same
Repentance in me, and by thy Spirit, power and grace, so to humble, mortifie, and feare my conscience for my sins to saluation, that in thy good time thou mayst comfort and quicken me again, through Iesus Christ thy dearely beloued Sonne. So be it. A Prayer before the receiuing of the holy Communion. O Father of mercy and God of all conso∣lation, seeing all creatures doe acknow∣ledge and confesse thee to be their Gouer∣nour and Lord, it becommeth vs, the work∣manship of thine owne hands, at all times to reuerence and magnifie thy godly Maie∣stie: first, for that thou hast created vs to thine owne Image and similitude, but chief∣ly because thou hast deliuered vs from that euerlasting death & damnation, into which Satan drew mankind by the meanes of sin, from the bondage whereof, neither man nor Angell was able to make vs free: but thou (O Lord) rich in mercy and infinite in goodnesse, hast prouided our redemption to stand in thine only and welbeloued Sonne, whom of very loue thou didst giue to bee made man like vnto vs in all things, sinne excepted, that in his body he might receiue the punishment of our transgression, by his death to make satisfaction to thy iustice, and by his resurrection to destroy him that was the authour of death, and so to bring againe life to the world, from which the whole of-spring of Adam was most iustly exiled. O Lord we acknowledge that no creature was able to comprehend the length, breadth, depth, and height of thy most excellent loue which moued thee to shew mercy where none was deserued, to pomise and giue life where death had gotten victory, to receiue vs into thy grace when wee could doe nothing but rebell a∣gainst thy maiestie. The blind dulnesse of our corrupt nature will not suffer vs sufficiently to weigh these thy most ample benefits. Yet neuer thlesse at the commandement of Iesus Christ our Lord, we present our selues to this thy Ta∣ble, which he hath left to be vsed in re∣membrance of his death vntill his com∣ming againe, to declae and witnesse before the world, that by him alone wee haue re∣ceiued libertie and life: that by him alone thou doest acknowledge vs to bee thy chil∣dren and heires: that by him alone wee haue entrance to the throne of thy grace, that by him alone we are possessed into our spirituall kingdome to eate and drinke at his Table, and with whom wee haue our conuersation presently in heauen, and by whom our bodies shall be raised vp againe from the dust, and shall be placed with him in that endlesse ioy which thou O Father of mercy hast prepared for thine elect be∣fore the foundation of the world was laid. And these most inestimable benefits we ac∣knowledge and confesse to haue receiued of thy fe mercy and grace, by thine onely beloued Sonne Iesus Christ. For the which therefore we thy Congregation, moued by thy holy Spirit, doe render to thee all thankes, prayse and glory for euer and euer. A thanskgiuing after the recei∣uing of the holy Commu∣nion. MOst mercifull Father, wee render vnto thee all prayse, thankes, honour, and glory, for that it hath pleased thee of thy great mercy to grant vnto vs miserable sinners, so excellent a gift and treasure, as to receiue vs into the fellowship and com∣pany of thy deere Sonne Iesus Christ our Lord, whom thou hast deliuered to death for vs, and hast giuen him vnto vs a neces∣sary food and nourishment vnto euerlasting life. And now we beseech thee also (O hea∣uenly Father) to grant vs this request, that thou neuer suffer vs to become so vnkind as to forget so worthy benefits, but rather imprint and fasten them sure in our hearts, that we may grow and increase daily more and more in true faith, which continually i exercised in all manner of good workes: and so much the rather (O Lord) confirme vs in these perillous dayes and rage of Sa∣tan, that we may constantly stand and con∣tinue in the nonfession of the same, to the aduancement of thy glory which  od ouer all things, and blessed for euer▪ Amen.
