TO THE RIGHT HONOVRABLE, EDWARD Lord Dennie, Baron of Waltham, &c. RIght Honourable: There is no one Doctrine, reuealed in the Word of God, or dispensed by the Prophets and Apostles, of greater vse and cōsequence in the life of man, then is that, which prescribeth a Forme of releeuing and rectifying the Conscience. The benefit, which from hence issueth vn∣to the Church of God, is vnspeakable. For first, it serveth to discouer the cure of the dangerousest sore that can be, the wound of the Spirit. Which how great a crosse it is, the Wise man reporteth out of true experience, when he saith, that the Spirit of a man will su∣staine Prou. 18. 14. his infirmitie, but a wounded Spirit who can beare it? And his meaning is, that no out∣ward griefe, can fall into the nature of man, which will not be with patience indured, to the vtmost, so long as the minde is not troub∣led, or dismaied. But when once the Spirit is
touched, and the heart, (which beeing well apaied, is the very fountaine of peace to the whole man,) smitten with feare of the wrath of God for sinne; the griefe is so great, the burden so intolerable, that it will not by any outward meanes, be eased or asswaged. Secondly, it giueth for all particular Ca∣ses, speciall and sound direction; whether man be to walke with God, in the immedi∣ate performance of the duties of his Seruice; or to conuerse with man, according to the state and condition of his life, in the Familie, Church, or Common-wealth. The want of which direction, of what force it is, to turne the actions of men, which are good in them∣selues, to sinnes in regard of the agents, S. Paul affirmeth in that generall Conclusion, Whatsoeuer is not of faith, is sinne. Wherein he Rom. 14. 23. would teach vs, that whatsoeuer is done, or vndertaken by men in this life, whether it concerne the knowledge and worship of God, or any particular dutie to be perfor∣med, by vertue of their Callings, for the com∣mon good; whereof they haue not sufficient warrant, and assurance in Conscience, groun∣ded vpon the Word, that it is to be done, or not to be done; to them it is a sinne. Thirdly, it is of all other Doctrines, (bee∣ing rightly vsed) the most comfortable. For it is not founded in the opinions, and varia∣ble conceits of men, neither doth it consist, of Conclusions and Positions, which are one∣ly
probable and coniecturall: (for the Con∣science of the doubting or distressed partie, can not be established and rectified by thē:) but it resteth vpon most sufficient and cer∣taine Grounds, collected and drawne out of the very Word of God, which, as it is mightie Hebr. 4. 12. in operation, pearcing the heart, and discerning the thoughts and intents thereof, so is it alone a∣uaileable and effectuall to pacifie the minde, and to giue full satisfaction to the Consci∣ence. And as the benefit is great; so the want of this Doctrine, together with the true manner of applying the same, is, and hath beene the cause, of many and great inconueniences. For euen of those that feare God, and haue recei∣ued to beleeue, there be many, who in the time of their distresses, when they haue con∣sidered the waight and desert of their sinnes, and withall apprehended the wrath of God, due vnto them; haue beene brought vnto hard exigents, mourning, and wayling, and Psal. 6. 6. and 22. 1, 2. crying out, as if God had forsaken them, vn∣till they haue beene releeued by the Spirit of Christ, in the meditation of the word, & pro∣mise Psal. 119. v. 49, 50. of God. But those especially, who haue not beene instructed in the knowledge of the truth, nor acquainted with the course of Gods dealing, with his distressed children, by reason of ignorance and blindnes in matters of Religion and pietie, when the Lord hath let loose the cord of their Consciences, and
set before their eyes, both the number of their sinnes committed, and the iust anger of God purchased thereby, what haue they done? surely despairing of the mercie of God, and their owne saluation, they haue ei∣ther growne to phrensie, and madnes, or els sorted vnto themselues fearefull ends, some by hanging, some by drowning, others by embruing their hands in their owne blood. And if not in regard of griefe and trouble of minde; yet for want of better resolution in particular cases, within the compasse of their generall or personall callings, (though other∣wise, men indued with some measure of knowledge and obedience,) they haue either abused, or els quite relinquished and forsaken their callings, and thereby become scanda∣lous, and offensiue vnto others. Now then, as by these and sundrie other Instances of proofe, the matter it selfe ap∣peares to be of great waight and importāce, so it is most meete, that the best and fittest course should be taken, in the teaching and inforcing of the same. In which regard we haue iust cause, to challenge the Popish Church, who in their Case-writings haue er∣red, both in the substance and circumstances of this Doctrine, as shall appeare in the se∣quele. First, because the dutie of releeuing the Conscience, is by them commended to the sacrificing Priest, which, though according
to their owne Canons Decret. de poenit. dist. 6. cap. 1. Caueat spiritual is iu∣dex, vt sicut non commisit crimen ne∣quitiae, itâ ō careat mune∣re scientiae. he should be a man of knowledge, and free from imputation of wickednes, yet oft times it falls out that he is either vnlearned, or els wicked and lewd of conuersation, and consequently vnfit for such a purpose. Secondly, they teach that their Preists ap∣pointed to be comforters and releeuers of the distressed, are made by Christ himselfe Iudices in caufis poeni∣tentium. Bell. de poen. lib. 3. cap. 2.

Whereas the Scrip∣ture vttereth a contrarie voice, that Christ onely hath the keyes of Dauid, which proper∣ly and truly openeth, and no man shutteth, and properly and truly shutteth, and no man openeth. And the Ministers of God are not called to be absolute Iudges of the Consciēce, but onely Messengers and Embassadors of re∣conciliation; 2. Cor. 5. 20. wherevpon it followeth, that they cannot be Theophl. comment. in Ioan. 3. 34. & Hieron. l. 3. comment. in Math. super verba. Tibi dabo claues. the authors and giers of remission of sinnes, but onely the Ministers and Dispen∣sers of the same. Thirdly, the Papists in their writings haue scattered here and there, sundrie false and er∣ronious Grounds of Doctrine, much preiudi∣ciall to the direction or resolution of the Emanuel Sa. in Aphor. cō∣essarorum. Summa An∣gelica. capit. ides. paragr. 6, 7. Conscience in time of neede, as namely, I. That a man in the course of his life, may build himselfe vpon the faith of his teachers, and for
his saluation rest, contented with an implicite and vn-expressed faith. Which doctrine, as it is an onely meane, to keepe men in perpetuall blindnes and ignorance, so it serueth to no other purpose in the time of Temptatiō, but to plunge the hart of man into the pit of de∣spaire, it being vncapable of cōfort, for want of particular knowledg & vnderstāding of the word & promise of God. I. That euery man ought to stand in feare and doubt of the pardon of Concil. Trid. sess. 6. cap. 9. his sinnes, and that no man can be assured by the certentie of faith, either of the present fa∣uour of God, or of his owne saluation. True it is, that in respect of our owne vnworthi∣nes and indisposition, we haue iust cause, not onely to doubt and feare, but to dispaire and be confounded before the iudgement seat of God. Yet that a man should not be cer∣tainely resolued by faith of the mercie of God, in and for the merir of Christ, is a com∣fortlesse doctrine to a distressed soule, and contrarie vnto the sauing Matth. 14. 31. Iam. 1. 6. Rom. . 20. word of the Go∣spel, which teacheth, that certentie floweth from the nature of faith, and not doubting. III. That euery man is bound in conscience vpon paine of damnation, to make speciall confession of Concil. Trid. ess. 4. can. 7. his mortall sinnes, with all the particular cir∣cumstāces therof once euery yere to his Priest. This position & practise, besides that it hath no warrant of sacred writte, nor yet any ground of Orthodoxe antiquitie, for 800. yeares, more or lesse after Christ: it maketh
notably to the disturbing of the peace of Conscience, in time of extremitie, conside∣ring that is impossible, either to vnderstand or remember all, many beeing hidden and Psal. 19. 12. vnknowne. And the minde being in this case informed, that forgiuenesse dependeth vpon such an enumeration, may thus be brought into doubt and distrust, and will not be able to rest by faith in the sole mercie of God, the onely soueraigne medicine of the soule. A∣gaine, the griefe of the mind, doth not al∣waies arise from all the sinnes that a man hath committed, neither doth the Lord set before the sinners eies, whatsoeuer euill hath bin done by him; but some one or more par∣ticulars. And these are they, that doe lie hea∣vie vpon the heart; and to be eased of them, will be worke inough, though he doth not exhibite vnto the Confessour, a Catalogue of all the rest. IV. That some sinnes are veniall, because they are onely besides the Lawe of God, not against it, and because Peceatum ve∣niale, quod non tolt ordinem ad vltimum fi∣nem, vnde non meretur poenā aeternam, sed temporalem. Iacob. de Gra∣phiis: Decision. aurcar. Cas. Consc. l. 1. cap. 6. they binde ouer the sinner onely to temporal, and not to eter∣nall punishments. This conclusion, first is false; For though it be granted, that some offences are greater, some lesser, some in a higher de∣gree, others in a lower. Againe, that sinnes in regard of the euent, beeing repented of, or in respect of the person sinning, beeing in Christ, and therefore accounted iust, are par∣donable, because they are not imputed to condemnation; yet there is no sinne of what
degree soeuer, which is not simply, and of it selfe mortall, whether we respect the nature of the sinne, or the measure and proportion of diuine iustice. For in nature it is an anomie, that is to say, an aberration from the perfect 1. Ioh. 3. 4. rule of righteousnesse, & therefore is subiect to the curse, both of temporarie and eternall death. It is an offence against the highest Maiestie, and consequently, man standeth by it ingaged to euerlasting torment. Secondly, it is a weake and insufficient ground of reso∣lution, to a troubled Conscience. For whereas true and sauing ioy is the daughter of sorrow, and the heart of man cannot be lifted vp, in assurance of Gods fauour, to the apprehensiō and conceipt of heauenly comforts, vnlesse it be first abased, and by true humiliation, brought to nothing in it selfe; The remem∣brance of this, that the offence committed is veniall, may in some cases too much inlarge the heart, and giue occasion to presume, when haply there will be reason to the con∣trary. And if not that, yet in case of falling by infirmitie after grace receiued, the mind bee∣ing forestalled with this erronious conceipt, that the sinne is lesse, then it is indeede, be∣cause veniall, may in the issue be lesse quie∣ted, and more perplexed. V. That a man may satisfie the iustice of God, for the temporall punish∣ment Concil. Trid. sess. 1. can. 13. of his sinnes committed. To omit the vn∣truth of is position; Howe it maketh to the casing of the heart, or the asswaging of the
griefe of minde in temptation, I appeale to common experience. For when a man, bee∣ing assured of the pardon of his sinnes, shall yet consider, that there is something more behind to be done on his part, how can he in probabilitie, rely himselfe wholly vpon Christs satisfaction? How can he reape vnto himselfe from thence any assurance of re∣conciliation to God, whome he formerly of∣fended? If we may and must doe something in our owne persons, whereby to appease the wrath of God, why hath our Sauiour taught vs for our hearts releife, wholly and onely to make the plea of pardon for our sinnes? True it is indeede, that Popish Confessours doe teach their Penitents, when they feele the wrath of God vpon them for sinne, to stoppe the mouth of Conscience, by performance of a formall humiliation and repentance, yea to offer vnto God some ceremoniall duties in way of satisfaction. But when sorrow sea∣zeth vpon the soule, and the man falls into temptation, then it will appeare that these directions were not currant; for notwith∣standing them, he may want sound comfort in Gods mercie, and runne into despaire without recouerie. And for this cause, vpon experience it hath bin prooued, that euen Pa∣pists themselues in the houre of death, haue bin content to renounce their owne workes, yea the whole body of humane satisfactions, and to cleaue onely to the mercie of God
in Christ for their saluation. By these instances, and many more that might be alleadged to this purpose, it is ap∣parent, vpon how weake and vnstable Grounds the Case-diuinitie of the Popish Church standeth; and how indirect a course they take, for the resolution and direction of the troubled Conscience. Now by the benefit and abuse of this Do∣ctrine, we see how necessary it is, that in Churches which professe Christiā religion, it should be more taught, and further inlarged, then it is. And to this purpose it were to be wished, that men of knowledge in the Mini∣sterie, that haue by the grace of God attained vnto the Tongue of the learned, would imploy their paines this way: not onely in searching into the depth of such points as stand in bare speculation, but in annexing thereunto the grounds and conclusions of practise, wherby they might both informe the iudgement, & rectifie the conscience of the hearers. By this means it would come to passe, that the poore distressed soule might be releeued, pietie and deuotion more practised, the kingdome of Sinne, Satan, and Antichrist weakened, and impayred, and the contrarie kingdome of Christ Iesus more and more established. What the Author & Contriuer of the Dis∣course ensuing hath done in this behalfe, it is euident by the whole course of his writings, that he hath left behinde him: all which, as
they doe openly shew vnto the world, howe great a measure of knowledge and vnder∣standing, with other endowments both of nature and grace, the Lord had inriched him withall; so they doe carrie with them the sweet sauour of pietie and sanctification, wherwith he approoued his heart vnto God, and his life vnto men. Wherein also vpon oc∣casion, he hath propounded, and explained sundry notable rules of direction and resolu∣tion of the Conscience, as wil appeare to the view of the learned & well-advised Reader. To let passe all the rest: this present Trea∣tise giueth very sufficient testimonie, of his knowledge and dexteritie in that kinde; which could not be attained vnto, without great paines, much obseruation, and long ex∣perience. A labour which commendeth it selfe to the Church of God in two respects principally. One, because his grounds and principles are drawne either directly, or by iust consequence out of the written Word, and so are of greater force, to con∣vince the conscience, and to giue satisfaction to the mind, either doubting, or distressed. The other, for that it is deliuered with such perspicuitie, and disposed in such order and Methode, as fitteth best for the vnderstan∣ding and memory of any, whosoeuer shall peruse it. Now this whole Treatise of the Questiōs, I haue made bold to present vnto your
Lordsh, and to publish abroad vnder your protection. First, because God, who vouchsa∣feth speciall fauour to them that honour him, hath adorned your estate with Honour, your person inwardly with many rich graces of his Spirit, and outwardly with the professi∣on and practise of true Religion; a thing di∣rectly confirmed by your vnfained loue of the truth, and continuall fauours to the Tea∣chers of the same, the Ministers and Dispen∣sers of the Gospel. Secondly, because as the Author of these Cases, was himselfe in many respects, bound vnto your Hon. while he li∣ued; so his wife and children for his sake, haue receiued much kindnes at your hands, since his death; a manifest proofe of the truth & synceritie of your affection towards him in the Lord. And in the last place, it was my desire, by setting them forth vnder your name, to giue some testimonie of dutie to your Hon. presuming that as you loued the Author, so you will be pleased to patronize the Worke, and fauourably to interpret, of the paines and good intention of the publi∣sher. And thus crauing pardon for my bold∣nes, I humbly take my leaue, and commend your Lordsh, to the grace & fauour of God in Christ. From Emanuel Colledge in Cambr. Novemb. 20. 1606. Your Hon. in all dutie to be commanded, Tho. Pickering.
To the godly and well∣affected Reader whosoeuer. I Doe now at the length offer vn∣to thy view (Christian Reader) the whole Treatise of Case-divi∣nitie, so farre as the Author pro∣ceeded in the deliuerie thereof before his death. If thou hast bin longer held in expectation thereof, then either thy selfe desiredst, or was meete, I must intreat thy fa∣uourable interpretation of my forbearance, partly in regard of many priuate distractions, and sun∣drie occurrents wherewith I was detained from this dutie, and partly also in respect of my desire to publish it in such sort to thy contentment, that it might afterward require no further filing or for∣bishing by secondarie Corrections. Wherein, not∣withstanding mine endeauour to the contrarie, my hope hath beene in part preiudiced, by reason of some faults escaped in the Printing, through want of carefull attendance on the Presse in my necessa∣rie absence. The principall I haue noted in a Ta∣ble before the first Booke, and the other of lesser moment, I commend to thy priuate pardon. Touching the Treatise it selfe, I haue dealt as faithfully as I could, keeping close to the Preach∣ers owne wordes, without any materiall addition, detraction, or amplification. His Methode re∣maines the same in the bodie of the discourse, not admitting the least alteration. Onely it was
thought conuenient to distinguish it into Bookes according to the severall distinct parts, the Bookes into Chapters, the Chapters that were most capa∣ble of diuision into Sections; and my meaning therein was, to helpe the memorie of the Reader, and to avoid tediousnes the daughter of longsome discourses. Now if in the perusing, thou either find a∣ny thing amisse, or thy selfe haply not fully satisfi∣ed in particular; then remember what is the Lot of learned mens workes which are Scripta post∣huma (wherof these latter times haue yeelded ma∣ny examples) to be left after a sort, naked and im∣perfect, when the Authors themselues are gone, who might haue brought them to perfection. Con∣sider againe, that in regard of the weight of this worthy Argument, it were much better kindely & thankfully to accept and inioy these labours, how∣soeuer imparted, then by their suppressing to be wholly depriued of such a benefite. And withall rest with me in hope, that as himselfe hath first In the Treat. Page. 4. traced the way, and walked by the bankes of this maine Sea, so others vpon this occasion, will be in∣couraged to attempt the like course, or at least to enlarge this worke by addition of more particulars. Meane while, not doubting of thy Christian ac∣ceptance of my paines for thy good, I commend them to thy loue, thy selfe vnto God and the word of his grace. Eman. Coll. Novemb. 20. 1606.

THE FIRST BOOKE of the Cases of Conscience, concerning Man simply considered in himselfe without relation to an other. The Preface declaring the Ground and Order of the Treatise following. Isaiah, 50. 4. The Lord God hath giuen me a tongue of the learned, that I should know, to minister a word in due time, to him that is wearie. IN that part of the Pro∣phecie which goes be∣fore, the holy Ghost set∣teth downe and foretel∣leth the Calling of the Gentiles, which was to beginne at the death of Christ, and from thence to continue vnto this day, and so consequently to the ende of the world. In the former verses of this Chap∣ter, there is mention made of the reiection of the Iewes; I meane not a generall, but a
particular rejection, namely then, when they were in affliction in the daies of Isaiah. Now in this, and so in all other Prophecies of the like kind, which intreat of this point; Christ himselfe is brought in, speaking in his owne person; and the words of this Chapter from the beginning, to this present verse and the rest that follow, are the words of Christ the Mediatour. In the verses going before, he disputes the case of their rejection, and and the summe of the whole disputation is: that either he or they themselues were the causes thereof; but he was not the cause, & therfore they them∣selues by their sinnes. The reason, whereby he prooues that they themselues were the cause, is framed in this sort. You Iewes cānot bring any writing or bill of diuorce, to shew that I rejected you: therfore I appeale euen to your owne consciences, whether you haue not brought this iudgement vpon your selues, by your iniquities. vers. 1. On the other side, the reasō why God was not the cause is: because he for his part called them in great mercie and ioue: but when he called they would not obey. ver. 2. Now in the ende of the second verse, is contained an answer to a secret reply, that some obstinate Iewe might make after this manner: God hath not nowe the like power in sauing and deliuering vs, as he hath had in formr times: therefore we cannot hope or
expect any deliuerance from him, and howe then shall we doe in the meane while? To this the Lord himselfe makes answer, ver. 2, 3, 4. that his hand is not shortned, nor his power lessened in regard of greater workes, much lesse in respect of their deli∣uerance; and though the present affli∣ction which they indured, was great and tedious, yet they were not to be ouermuch dismayed in themselues, but rather to be comforted: because God had giuen him the tongue of the learned, to minister a word in season to the wearie and distressed, and consequently, that he had power to case and refresh that their wearines and afflicti∣on. In this text then, there is set downe one principal dutie of Christs propheticall office, by allusion to the practises of the Prophets in the old Testament, especially those which belonged to the schooles of Elias and Eli∣zeus, who are here tearmed, the learned. And out of the words thereof, one speciall point of instruction may be gathered, name∣ly, That there is a certaine knowledge or do∣ctrine reuealed in the word of God, whereby the consciences of the weake may be rectified and pacified: I gather it thus. It was one speciall dutie of Christs propheticall office, to giue comfort to the conscien∣ces of those that were distressed, as the Pro∣phet here recordeth. Now as Christ had this
power to execute and performe such a dutie, so he hath committed the dispensation ther∣of to the Ministers of the Gospel. For we may not thinke that Christ in his owne per∣son, ministred and spake words of comfort to the wearie, in the times of the Prophets, because he was not then exhibited in our nature; and yet he did then speake, but how? in the persons of the Prophets. So likewise, because Christ now in the new Testament, speaks not vnto the afflicted in his owne pro∣per person, it remaineth therfore, that he per∣formes this great worke in the Ministerie of Pastours and Teachers vpon earth, to whom he hath giuen knowledge, and other gifts to this ende and purpose. There must needes therefore be a certen and infallible doctrine, propounded and taught in the Scriptures, whereby the consciences of men distressed, may be quieted and releeued. And this do∣ctrine is not attained vnto by extraordinarie reuelation, but must be drawne out of the written word of God. The point therfore to be handled is, What this doctrine should be? It is not a matter easie and at hand, but full of labour and diffi∣cultie: yea very large, like vnto the maine sea: I will onely (as it were) walke by the banks of it, and propound the heads of do∣ctrine, that thereby I may, at least, occasion others, to consider & handle the same more at large.
That I may proceede in order: First, I am to lay downe certaine Grounds or Pream∣bles, which may giue light and direction to the things that follow: and in the next place, I will propound and answer the maine and principall Questions of Conscience. CHAP. I. Of the two first Grounds of Cases, Confession, and the degrees of Goodnes. THe Grounds or Pream∣bles are especially foure. The first, touching Con∣fession. The second, tou∣ching the degrees of Goodnesse in things and actions. The third, tou∣ching the degrees of Sinne. The fourth and last concerning the Subiection and Power of conscience. Of these in order. Sect. 1. The first Ground is, That in the trou∣bles of conscience, it is meete and conue∣nient, there should alwaies be vsed a pri∣uate Confession. For Iames saith, Confesse your faults one to another, and pray one for another, Iam. 5. . thereby signifying that Confession in this case, is to be vsed as a thing most requisite. For in all reason, the Physitian must first know the disease, before he can applie the remedie: and the griefe of the heart will not
be discerned, vnlesse it be manifested by the confession of the partie diseased; and for this cause also in the griefe of conscience, the scruple, that is, the thing that troubleth the conscience must be knowne. Neaerthelesse in priuate confession, these caueats must be obserued. First, it must not be vrged, as a thing simply or absolutely neces∣sarie, without which there can be no saluatiō. Againe, it is not fit that confession should be of all sinnes, but onely of the scruple it selfe, that is, of that or those sinnes alone, which do trouble and molest the conscience. Thirdly, though confession may be made to any kind of mn, (Confesse one to another, saith Iames,) yet is it especially to be made to the Pro∣phets and Ministers of the Gospell. For they in likelyhood, of all other men, in respect of their places and gifts, are the fittest and best able to instruct, correct, cōfort, & enorme the weake & wounded cōscience. Lastly, the per∣son to whome it is made, must be a man of trust & fidelity, able & willing to keepe secret things that are reueiled, yea to burie thē (as it were) in the graue of obliuion, for Loue coue∣reth a multitudeof sinnes. Sect. 2. The next Ground is touching the degrees of Goodnes in humane things and actions. Goodnesse in things is twofold; vncrea∣ted and created. Vncreated is God him∣selfe, who neuer had beginning, and
who is Goodnesse it-selfe, because his nature is absolutely and perfectly good, and be∣cause he is the author and worker thereof, in all things created. Created goodnes, is that whereby the creature is made good; and it is nothing els, but the fruit of that goodnesse, that is essentially in God. Now the degrees thereof are these. There is a generall or na∣turall Goodnesse in creatures, & a more spe∣ciall or morall Goodnesse. Generall Goodnesse is that, whereby all creatures are accepted and approoued of God, by whome they were both created & ordained. Thus euery creature is good, part∣ly by creation, and partly by ordination. By creation it is, that the substance of each crea∣ture, as of the Sunne, the Moone, the Earth, Water, Meate, Drink, &c. is good, hauing the beeing thereof from God. Hence also the es∣sentiall properties, quantities, qualities, mo∣tions, actions and inclinations of the crea∣tures, in themselues considered, with all their euents, are good. By the same generall good∣nesse also, euen the Deuill himselfe and his actions, as he is a substance, and as they are actions, hauing their beeing from God, are good. Things againe doe take vnto them the condition of Goodnesse, not onely by crea∣tion, but also by Gods ordination, whereby they are directed and appointed, to some certen vses & endes. Thus the euill Consci∣ence, Hel, & Deathare good, because they are
ordained of God, for the execution of his iu∣stice, howsoeuer in themselues & to vs they be euill. Besides this generall and naturall good∣nesse, there is also a speciall or morall goodnes properly so called: and it is that, which is a∣greeable to the eternall and vnchangeable wisdome of God, reuealed in the Morall Law, wherin it is commanded; and things as they are therein commanded to be done by God, are good morally. Now of actions mo∣rally good, there be two degrees: for they are either good in themselues alone, or good both in themselues, and in the doer. In them∣selues alone some things be morally good: for example, when a wicked man giues an almes, it is a good worke onely in it selfe, but not good in the doer, because it is not done in faith, and from a good conscience: and so are all the vertues of the Heathen, moral∣ly good in themselues, but they are not good in heathen men: for in them they are but Splendida peccata. beautifull sinnes. The next degree of good∣nesse is, whereby things and actions are both good in themselues, and in the doer also. Of this sort were the praiers and almes of Corne∣lius good in themselues, and in him also, be∣cause Act. 10. he was a beleeuer. Now opposite to things and actions mo∣rally good or euill, are actions and things of a middle nature, commonly tearmed Indiffe∣rent, which in themselues being neither good
nor euill, may be done or not done without sinne; In themselues I say, for in their cir∣cumstances, they are and may be made either euill or good. And here we must remember, to put a difference betweene conueniencie, and inconuenience, which ariseth from the nature of indifferent things. Conueniencie is, when a thing or action is so fitted to the cir∣cumstances, and the circumstances fitted to it, that thereby it becomes a thing Conueni∣ent. On the other side, Inconuenience is, when the thing or action is done in vnmeete cir∣cumstances, which bring some hurt or losse to the outward man, or stand not with de∣cencie: and therefore doe make it to be In∣conuenient. And by this that hath been said, we may discerne, when an action is good, e∣uill, indifferent, conuenient, or inconuenient. CHAP. II. Of the nature and differences of Sinne. THe third Ground, is touching the degrees or differences of Sinne. And here we must first of all search, what is Sinne properly, and what is proper∣ly a Sinner. Sect. 1. Sinne in his proper nature (as Saint Iohn saith) is an anomie, that is, a want of con∣formitie 1. Ioh. 3. 4.
to the lawe of God. For the better vnderstanding whereof, we must know, that there were in Adam before his fall, three things not to be seuered one from the other: the Substance of his bodie and soule: the Faculties and Powers of his bodie and soule: and the Image of God consisting in a straightnes, and conformitie of all the affecti∣ons, and powers of man to Gods will. Now when Adam falls, and sinnes against God, what is his sinne? Not the want of the two former, (for they both remained,) but the very want, and absence of the third thing, namely, of conformitie to Gods will. I make it plaine by this resemblance; In a musicall instrument, there is to be considered, not only the instrument it selfe, and the sound of the instrumēt, but also the harmony in the sound. Nowe the contrarie to harmonie, or the dis∣order in musicke, is none of the two former, but the third, namely the discord, which is the want or absence of harmonie, which we call disharmonie. In the same manner, the sinne of Adam, is not the absence either of the sub∣stance, or of the faculties of the soule and the bodie, but the want of the third thing before named, & that is, conformitie or correspon∣dencie to the will of God, in regard of obe∣dience. But some may say: the want of con∣formitie in the powers of the soule, is not sinne properly: because in sinne, there must bee not onely an absence of goodnesse, but
be some twentie or thirtie yeares: yet the partie offending, doth not therefore cease to be a sinner. Now then I demaund, what is the very thing, for which he is named and tear∣med still a sinner in the time present, the of∣fence beeing past? The answer is, that euery actuall sinne, beside the three former, must be considered with a fourth thing, to wit, a cer∣taine staine, or blotte, which it imprints and 4. Macul. leaues in the offender as a fruit, and that is an inclination, or euill disposition of the heart, wherby it becomes more apt & prone to the offence done, or to any other sinne. For looke as the dropsie man, the more he drinks, the drier he is, and the more he still desires to drinke: euen so a sinner, the more he sinnes, the apter is he to sinne, and more desirous to keepe still a course in wickednes. And as a man that lookes vpon the Sunne, if he turne his face away, remains turned vntill he turne himselfe againe: so he that turnes from God by any sinne, makes himselfe a sinner, and so remaines, vntill he turne himselfe againe by repentance. Thus Dauid was a sinner, not onely in the very act of his adulterie & mur ther: but euen when the act was done past, he remained still a murtherer and  dulterer; because a new, or rather a re pronenesse to these, and all oth tooke place in his heart by his fal strength, till he turned to God by vpon the admonition of the Pro
thing then, whereby a sinner is tearmed a sin∣ner, is the Fault together with the fruit there∣of, namely, the Blot imprinted in the soule, so oft as men doe actually offend. The Vse of this doctrine touching sinne, is twofold. First, by it we learne and see what is Originall sinne, wherby an Infant in the first conception and birth is indeed a sinner. Euery Infant must be considered as a part of Adam, proceeding of him and partaking of his nature: and therby it is made a sinner, not onely by imputation of Adams offence, but also by propagation of an aptesse, and pronenes vnto euery euill, receiued together with nature from Adam. And thus ought we to conceiue Originall sinne, not to be the corruption of nature alone, but Adams first offence imputed, with the fruit there∣of the corruption of nature, which is an inclination vnto euery euill, deriued together with nature from our first parents. Second∣ly; by this we are taught, to take heed of all and euery sinne, whether it be in thought, word, or deed: because the committing ther∣of, though in respect of the act it passeth a∣ in the doing, yet it breedeth and in∣seth a wicked disposition in the heart, h beene said) to the offence done, or a∣ sinne. Men deceiue themselues, that the euill of sinne, to be only in the ng & to goe no further; wheras in∣ offence hath a certen blot going
with it, that corrupteth the heart, and causeth man to delight and lie in his offence, which lying in sinne is a greater cause of damnatiō, then the very sin it selfe. This therfore must admonish vs, to take heed least we continue in any sinne, and if it fall out, that through infirmitie we be ouertaken by any tentation, we must labour to rise again, and turne from our sinne to God, by new and speedy repen∣tance. Sect. 3. Thus much of Sinne it selfe. Now follow the Differences thereof, which are manifold. The first sort are to be gathered from the causes and beginnings of sinne in man, which are threefold, Reason, will, and Affe∣ction. The differēces of sinne in respect of Rea∣son are these, First, some are sinnes of know∣ledge, some of ignorance. A sinne of Know∣ledge is, when a man offends against his knowledge, doing euill when he knoweth it to be euill: and this is greater then a sinne of ignorance, for he that knoweth his masters will, and doth it not, shall be beaten with many stripes. A sinne of Ignorance is, when a man doth e∣uill, not knowing it to be euill. Thus Paul was a blasphemer, an oppressour, and persecuted the Church of Christ ignorantly, and in a blinde zeale, not knowing that which hee did to be euill. Nowe by ignorance
here I meane, an ignorance of those things which ought to be knowne; and this is two∣fold: simple, or affected. Simple ignorance is, when a man after diligence and good paines taking, still remaines ignorant: this ignorance will not excuse any man, if it be of such things as he is bound to know: for it is said, He that doth not his masters will, by rea∣son he knew it not, shall be beaten with stripes, though fewer. And in this regard, euen the Heathen which knew not God, are inexcusable, be∣cause they were bound to haue known him. For Adam had the perfect knowledge of God imprinted in his nature, and lost the same through his owne default, for himselfe and his posteritie. And it is the commande∣ment of God, whereunto euery man is boūd to performe obedience, that man should know him, that is, his will and word. But some may say then, how can any man be saued, seeing euery man is ignorāt of ma∣ny things which he ought to know? An. If we know the groūds of religion, & be careful to obey God according to our knowledge, ha∣uing withall a care and desire, to increase in the knowledge of God and his will, God will hold vs excused: for our desire and in∣deauour to obey, is accepted for obedience it selfe. And the greater this simple ignorāce is, the lesser is the sinne. For hereupon it was, that Peter lessened, and (in some sort) excused Act. 3. .
the sinne of the Iewes, in crucifying Christ, because they did it through ignorance: and so doth Paul his sinne in persecuting the Church, when he alleadgeth, that it was done 1. Tim. 1. 13. ignorantly in vnbeleefe. But howsoeuer this sinne by such meanes may be lessened, yet re∣maines it still a sinne worthie condemnati∣on. Affected ignorance is, when a man takes delight in his ignorance, and will of purpose be ignorant: not vsing, but contemning the meanes, wherby to get and increase know∣ledge: and that carelessely and negligently, because he will not leaue sinne which he lo∣ueth, nor forsake the euill trade of life, wher∣in he delighteth. This is the sinne of those, whereof Iob speaketh, who say vnto God, Depart from vs: for we desire not the knowledge Iob 21. 14. of thy waies. And of whome Dauid complain∣eth, that they flatter themselues in their owne Psal. 36. . 3. eyes, and haue left off to vnderstand, and to doe good. This ignorance is damnable and deui∣lish: it excuseth no man, but doth rather ag∣grauate and increase his sinne: yea it is the mother of many grieuous enormities. Againe, Ignorance is twofold: of the Ignorant . Law, or of the thing the Law requireth. Ig∣norance of the Law is, when a man knowes not the Law of god writtē, nor the law of na∣ture. This ignorance may somewhat lessen the sinne, but it excuseth no man: because it is naturall, and euery man is bound to know the Law. Ignorance of the thing the Law
requireth, is the Ignorance of the Ignorantia facti. fact: and that is either with the fault of the doer, or without the fault. Faultie ignorāce, is the ignorance of a fact, which he might haue preuēted. As whē a mā in his drunkēnes killeth another: in this fact, not knowing what de doth, he also knoweth not that he hath offended: & yet because he might haue preuented his drunkennes, ther∣fore he is faultie, and sinneth. Faultlesse ig∣norance is, when a fact is done, which could not be either knowne, or auoided before hand. For example: if a man be opping a tree, and his axe head fall from the helve, out of his hand, and kills another passing by; here is indeede manslaughter, but no volun∣tarie murther: because it was a thing that could not be auoided, and did not fall out through his default. And this ignorance is excusable. The second Fountaine of Sinne, is the Will, from whence arise these three differen∣ces of sinnes: some are from the will imme∣diately, some besides the will, and some are mixt, partly with the will, and partly against the will. Sinnes proceeding from the will, are pro∣perly tearmed voluntarie; such as the doer mooued by his own wil commits, though he know them to be euill. And here, the more free the wil is, the greater is the sinne: for wil added to knowledge, makes the sinne the
greater. Vnder voluntarie sinnes, are compre∣hended all such, as proceede from stirred af∣fections; as when a man tells a lie for feare, or striketh another in anger: and the reason is because these offences, though they are not done vpon deliberation, but arise from the violence of affection, yet they doe not ex∣clude Consent. Hither also we may referre, sinnes committed by compulsion: as when a man is forced to denie his religion, his of∣fence in deede and in truth is voluntarie, (though some otherwise think it to be a mixt action) For compulsion doth not reach to the will, but to the outward man, and serues to draw forth a consent: and and when consent is yeelded, he denies his religion voluntarily: for the will cannot be constrained. Voluntas n cogitur. In the next place, sinnes beside the will are such, as are neither directly from the wil, nor against it. Of this sort are the first sudden motions vnto sinne, conceiued in the heart with some inward pleasure and delight: and these are truly sinnes, though in respect little sinnes, condemned in the last commande∣ment. And they are not from the will, be∣cause they goe without and before consent: neither yet are they against the will, because then the heart would not take delight in them. Here by the way, we are to note, against the doctrine of the Papists, that all sinnes are not voluntarie: for whatsoeuer wanteth con∣formitie
to the law of God, is sinne, whe∣ther it be with consent of will or no. But ma∣ny such desires and delights, arise suddenly in the heart of man, which are not accor∣ding to the law of God, and haue no consent or approbation of will. In like manner, whē one man kils another, thinking that he killeth a wild beast: if the same man remembreth afterwards what he hath done, and is not grieued for the fact: in this case he hath sin∣ned, because his not grieuing, is offensiue vn∣to God, though the fact were meerely be∣sides his will. Mixt sinnes are partly from the will, part∣ly against it. Of this sort are the workes of the man regenerate, which are done partly with his will, and partly against his will bee∣ing partly good, and partly euill. The reason hereof is this. There are in man after regene∣ration, two contrarie grounds or beginnings of actions: to wit, naturall corruption, or the inclination of the minde, wil, and affections, to that which is against the Law, called the Flesh; and a created qualitie of holines, wrought in the said faculties by the holy Ghost, tearmed the Spirit. And these two are not seuered, but ioyned and mingled toge∣ther, in all the faculties and powers of the soule. Now betweene these, there is a conti∣nuall combate, corruption fighting against grace, & grace against corruptiō. Hence it is, that there beeing euen in one & the same wil
trarie inclinatiōs, there must necessarily flow from the man regenerate, contrary actions; the flesh in euery action, willing that which is euill, and the Spirit on the otherside, that which is good. This Paul confessed and ac∣knowledged, vpon his owne experi∣ence, after his conuersion, when he said, To will is present with me, but I find no meanes [per∣fectly Rom. 7. 18. to do] that which is good. Again, I delight in and 22. 23. the law of God, concerning the inner man, but I see an other law in my members, rebelling against the law of my minde, and leading me captiue to the law of sinne, which is in my members. The third Ground or fountaine of sinne in man, is Affection, from whence doe pro∣ceede two kinds, namely, sinnes of Infirmitie, and sinnes of Presumption. Sinnes of Infirmitie are such, as proceede from the sudden passions of the minde, and the strong affectiōs of the heart: as from ha∣tred, griefe, anger, sorrow, & such like. These sinnes are commonly thought to be in all men: but the truth is, they are properly inci∣dent to the regenerate. For infirmitie cannot be said properly to be in them, in whome sin hath firmitie or strength, and where there is no power of grace at all. Againe, the man that is regenerate, sinneth not neither when he would, because he is restrained by the grace of God that is in him: nor in what manner he would, partly because he sinneth not with al his heart, the strength of his flesh
beeing abated by the Spirit; and partly, for that beeing fallen, he lies not still, but reco∣uers himselfe by speedy repentance. An eui∣dent argument, that the sinnes whereinto he falleth, are not presumptuous, but are ordi∣narily of weaknes and infirmitie. Sinnes of Présumptiō are such, as proceed from pride, arrogancy, wilfulnes, and hauti∣nes of mans heart. Against these Dauid prai∣eth, saying, Let not presumptuous sinnes haue do∣minion ouer me. And of them there be three Psal. 19. 13. degrees. The first is: when a man wilfully goeth on in his sinnes, vpon an erronious perswasion of Gods mercie, and of his owne future re∣pentance; this is the sinne of most men. The second is, when a man sinneth wilful∣ly, in contempt of the law of God: this is cal∣led by Moses, a sinne with a high hand, & the punnishment thereof was, by present death Num. 15. 30. to be cut off from among the people. The third, when a man sinneth, not onely wilfully and contemptuouslly, but of malice & spight against God himselfe, and Christ Iesus. And by this we may conceiue what is the sin against the holy Ghost: which is not euery sinne of presumption, or against know∣ledge and conscience: but such a kind of pre∣sumptuous offence, in which true religion is renounced: and that of set purpose and resol∣ued malice, against the very Maiestie of God himselfe and Christ. Heb. 10. 29.
Sect. 4. Now follow other Differences of sinne in regard of the obiect thereof, which is the Law. In respect of of the Law, sin is two fold: either of Commissiō or of Omission. I say, in respect of the Law, because God hath reuea∣led in his Law two sorts of precepts: the one wherein some good thing is commanded to be done, as to loue God with all our hearts, and our neighbour as our selues: the other wherin some euill is forbidden to be done, as the making of a grauen Image, the taking the name of God in vaine, &c. Now a sinne of Cōmission is, when a man doth any thing, that is flatly forbidden in the Law and word of God: as when one man kills another contrarie to the Law, which saith, Thou shalt not kill. A sinne of Omission is, when a man leaueth vnperformed, some dutie which the Law requireth: as for exam∣ple, the preseruing of his neighbours life, or good estate, when it lieth in his power so to doe. These also are truly sinnes, and by them Math. 25. 42. 43. as well as by the other, men shall be tried in the last iudgement. Sinnes of Omission haue three degrees. First, when a man doth nothing at all, but o∣mits the dutie commanded, both in whole and in part; as when hauing opportunitie & abilitie, he doth not mooue so much as one finger, for the sauing of his neighbours life.
Secondly, when a man performes the du∣tie inioyned, but failes both in the manner & measure therof. Thus the Heathen failed in doing good workes, in that the things which they did, for substance and matter were good and commendable, beeing done vpon ciuill and honest respects, and referred to the cōmon good; yet in truth their actions were no better then sinnes of omission, in as much as they issued from corrupted foun∣taines, hearts voide of faith: and aimed not at the maine end, and scope of all humane actions, the honour and glorie of God. Thirdly, when a man doth things in a right manner, but faileth in the measure thereof. And thus the children of God doe sinne, in al the duties of the lawe. For they doe the good things the law commādeth, in louing God & their neighbour: but they cannot attaine to that measure of loue, which the lawe requi∣reth. And thus the best men liuing, doe sinne in euery good worke they doe, so as if God should enter into iudgement, deale with thē in the rigour of his iustice, & examine them by the strict rule of the Lawe, he might iustly condemne them, euen for their best actions. And in this regard, when we pray daily for the pardon of our sinnes, the best workes we doe, must come in the number of them: because we faile, if not in substance & man∣ner, yet at the least in the measure of good∣nesse, that ought to bee in the doing
of them. We must also haue care to repent vs, euen of these our sins of Omission, as well as of the other of Commission: because by leauing vndone our dutie, we doe oftner of∣fend, then by sinnes committed: and the least Omission is enough to condemne vs, if it should be exacted at our hands. Sect. 5. The next difference of Sinnes may be this. Some are Crying sinnes, some are sinnes of Toleration. Crying sinnes I call those, which are so hainous, & in their kind so grieuous, that they hasten Gods iudgements, and cal downe for  speedie vengeance vpon the sinner. Of this kind there are sundry examples in the Scrip∣tures, principally foure. First, Cains sinne in murthering his innocent brother Abell; Gen. 4.  whereof it was saide, The voice of thy brothers blood crieth vnto me from the earth. The next is, the sinne of Sodome and Gomorrha, which was pride, fulnes of bread, abundance of i∣dlenesse: vnmerciful dealing with the poore, and all manner of vncleannesse, Ezech. 16. & of this, The Lord said, that the crie of Sodome Gen. . 20. and Gomorrha wa great, and their sinnes excee∣ding grieuous. The third, is the sinne of Oppres∣sion, indured by the Israelites in Egypt, at the hand of Pharao, and his task-masters. Exod. . 7. & alias Exod. 2. 23. 27. The fourth, is mercilesse Iniustice in wrongfull withholding, and detaining Iam. 5. 4.
the labourers hire. Now they are called Crying sinnes, for these causes. First, because they are now come to their full measure and height; beyond which God will not suffer them to passe, without due punishment. Againe, the Lord takes more notice, and inquires further into them, then into others, by reason that they exceede, and are most eminent where they be committed. Thirdly, they call for present helpe to the afflicted and wronged, and con∣sequently, for speedie exequution of venge∣ance, vpon the authors and committers of them. And lastly, because God is wont to giue are vnto the cryes of those, that endure  so heauie measure at the hands of others, and accordingly to helpe them, and reward the other with deserued punishment. Next vnto these are sinnes of Toleration, lesser then the former: which though in thē∣selues they deserue death, yet God in his mercie shewes his patience & long sufferāce, vpon the committers thereof, either defer∣ring the temporal punishment, or pardoning both temporall and eternall to his Elect. Such a sinne was the ignorance of the Gentiles before Christs comming: which God defer∣red to punish, and (as we say) . winked at Act. 17. 30. it. More especially, there be three sorts of sinnes of Toleratiō: the first is Originall sin, or concupiscence, in the regenerate after re∣generation,
and the fruits thereof: for it is not quite abolished by regeneration, but re∣maines more or lesse molesting & tempting a man till death. And yet if we carrie a con∣stant purpose not to sinne, and indeauour our selues to resist all tentations: this concupis∣cence of ours, shall not be imputed vnto vs, nor we condemned for it. And to this pur∣pose the holy Apostle saith, There is no con∣demnation to them that are in Christ. Yet saith Rom. 8. . he not, There is nothing worthie condemnation in them: for Originall sinne remaines till death, truly deseruing damnation, though it be not imputed. The second kind of sinnes of Toleration  are secret, vnknowne, and hidden sinnes in the regenerate. For who can tell how of he of∣fendeth? Psal. 10. saith Dauid. When a man that is the child of God, shall examine his heart, and humble himselfe euen for all his particular sinnes, which he knoweth by himselfe: there shall yet remaine some vnknowne sinnes, of which he cannot haue a particular repen∣tance: and yet they are not imputed, when there is repētance for knowne sinnes. As for example, Dauid repents of his murther & a∣dulterie, and yet afterwards (erring in iudge∣ment, by reason of the corruption of the times,) he liued to his death in the sinne of polygamie, without any particular repen∣tance, that we heare of. In like manner did the Patriarkes, who may not altogether be
excused: yet they were not cōdemned therof: neither were they saued without repentance for this sinne, but God in mercie accepted a generall repētance for the same. And the like is the case of all the Elect, in regard of their secret & hidden faults: for vnles God should accept of a general repentance for vnknown sinns, few or none at all should be saued. And herein doth the endles mercy of god notably appeare, that he vouchsafeth to accept of our repētance whē we repent, though not in par∣ticular as we ought to doe. Neuertheles, this must not incorage, or imbolden any man to liue in his sinnes, without turning vnto God. For vnlesse we repent in particular, of all the  sin we know, not only our knowne offences, but euen our secret sinnes shall cōdemne vs. Many sinnes are committed by men, which afterwards in processe of time are quite for∣gotten. Others are cōmitted, which notwith∣stāding are not knowne, whether they be sins or no. And in doing the best duties we can, we offend often, & yet when we offend, we perceiue it not: & all these in the regenerate, through the mercy of God, are sinnes of To∣leratiō, in respect of particular repentance. The third kind of sinnes of Toleration, are certaine particular facts of men not appro∣ved of in Scripture, and yet remitted in re∣spect of punishment. Such was the fact of Zipporah, in circumcising her child, in pre∣sence Exod. . 25. of her husband, he beeing able to haue
done it himselfe, and shee hauing no calling, to doe that which she did. For though the hand of God was against him, yet was he not sick, (as some would excuse the matter) neither is there any such thing in the text: but it is rather to be thought, that she her selfe circumcised her sonne in hast, to pre∣uent her husband: for the deede was done in some indignation, and shee cast the foreskin at his feete. And yet because this fact was some manner of obedience in that the thing was done which God required, (though not in the māner that he required) God accepted the same, & staied his hand frō killing Moses. Thus god accepted of Ahabs humility, thogh it were in hypocrisie, because it was a shew of 1. Kin. 21. obedience: and for that deferred a temporall punishmēt, til the daies of his posteritie. God sent Lyons to destroy the Assyrians, that dwelt in Samaria, for their Idolatrie: yet so soon as 2. in. 17. they had learned to feare the Lord after the māner of the god of Israel, though they min∣gled the same with their own Idolatric, God for that halfe obedience, suffered thē to dwel in peace. Sect. 6. The Sixt distinction of Sinnes may be this. Some are sinnes against God, some against men. This distinction is grounded vpon a place in Samuel: If one man sinne against ano∣ther, 1. Sam. . 25. the Iudge shall iudge it: but if a man sinne against the Lord, who shall plead for him?
Sinnes against God are such as are direct∣ly and immediately committed against the maiestie of God. Such are Atheisme, Idola∣trie, Blasphemie, Periurie, Profanation of the Sabboth, & all the breaches of the first Table. Sinnes against men, are iniuries, hurts, los∣ses, and damages; whereby our neighbour is in his dignitie, life, chastitie, wealth, good name, or any other way iustly offended, or by vs hindred. And such actions must be con∣sidered two waies. First, as they are iniuries and hurts done vnto our neighbour: and fe∣condly, as they are anomies, or breaches of Gods law, forbidding vs to doe them: and in this second respect they are called sinnes, be∣cause sinne is properly against God: and therefore by sinnes against man, we are to vnderstand, iniuries, losses, or damages done vnto them. In this sense, must that place in Matthew be expounded: If thy brother sinne against thee, &c. Matth. . Sect. 7. The seauenth Difference of sinnes, is noted by S. Paul, where he saith, Euery sinne that a man doth, is without the bodie: but he that com∣mits 1. Cor. 6. . fornication, sinneth against his owne bodie. In which place it is implyed that some sinnes are without the bodie, & some against mans owne bodie. Sinnes without the bodie, are such sinnes
as a man committeth, his bodie beeing the instrument of the sinne, but not the thing a∣bused. Such are Murther, Theft, & Drunken∣nesse: for in the committing of these sinnes, the bodie is but a helper, and onely a remote instrumentall cause, and the thing a∣bused is without the bodie. For example: in drunkennes, the thing abused by the drun∣kard, is wine or strong drinke: in theft, ano∣ther mans goods: in murther, the instrument whereby the fact is committed. The bodie indeede conferres his helpe to these things, but the iniurie is directed to the creatures of God, to the bodie and goods of our neigh∣bour. And such are all sinnes, adulterie onely excepted. Sinnes against the bodie, are those in which it selfe, is not onely the instrument, but the thing abused also. Such a sinne is Adulterie onely, and those that are of that kind, pro∣perly against the bodie: first, because the bo∣die of the sinner, is both a furthering cause of the sinne, and also that thing which he a∣buseth against his owne selfe. Secondly, by this offence, he doth not onely hinder, but loose the right, power, and propertie of his bodie, in that be makes it the member of an harlot. And lastly, though other sinnes in their kind, doe bring a shame and dishonour vpon the bodie, yet there is none that sit∣teth so nigh, or leaueth a blot so deepely im∣printed in it, as doth the sinne of vncleannes.
Sect. 8. The eight distinction of sinnes is grounded vpon Pauls exhortation to Timothie: Com∣municate not with other mens sinnes. Sinnes are either Other mens sinnes, or Communicatiō 1. Tim. . 2. with other mens sins. This distinction is the rather to be knowne and remembred, be∣cause it serues to extenuate or aggrauate sins committed. Communication with sinne is done sundry waies. First, by counsell: thus Caphas sinned when he gaue counsel to put Christ to death. Secondly, by commandement: so Dauid sin∣ned in the murther of Vrias. Thirdly, by con∣sent, or assistance, Rom. 1. 31. thus Saul sin∣ned in keeping the garments of them that oned Steuen, Act. 22. 20. & 7. 58. Fourthly, by prouocation: thus they sinne that pro∣uok others to sinne, and hereof Paul spea∣keth when he saith, Fathers must not prouoke their children to wrath, Eph. 6. 4. Fiftly, by neg∣ligence, or silence. This is the sinne of the Minister, when men are called to reprooue sinne and doe not. Sixtly, by flatterie, when men sooth vp others in sinne. Seauenthly, by winking at sinnes, or passing them ouer by slight reproofe, Eph. 5. 11. Thus Eli sinned in rebuking his sonnes, and thereby brought a temporall iudgement vpon himselfe, and his familie, 1. Sam. 2. chap. and 4. Eightly, by participation, Eph. 5. 7. & thus they doe sinne,
that are receiuers of the eues. Ninthely, by defending another man in his sinne: for he Prov. 17. 5. that iustifieth the wicked, and condemneth the iust, euen they both are an abomination to the Lord. Sect. 9. The Ninth distinction followeth. Some mens sinnes (saith Paul) are open before hand, 1. Tim. 5. 24. some follow after. Which place by some is ex∣pounded thus: Some mens sinnes are kept se∣cret, till the last iudgement, and some are re∣uealed in this life, before that day. This I thinke is a truth, but not the meaning of the text. For in the 23. verse the Apostle spake of Ordination, giuing charge to Timothie, that he should not suddenly admit any into Ec∣clesiasticall offices, least he did partake with their sinnes. Now in this 24. verse, e rende∣reth a reason thereof, saying, Some mens sinnes are open before hand: that i, some mens faults and wants are knowne, before their ordina∣tion to Ecclesiasticall offices, and of such the Church may know what to iudge and say. But some againe follow after, that is, they are not reuealed till after their Ordination: & thus Iudas his wickednes did not appeare at the first, but was reuealed after he was called to be an Apostle. And thus we see, what be the Differences of Sinnes: touching all which, this must be held & remembred for a Ground, That eue∣ry
sinne, in what degree soeuer it be, is mor∣tall of it selfe: and no sinne is veniall in it owne nature. For the wages of euery sinne is death. And, Cursed is euery one, that continueth Rom. 6. 23. not in all things, that are written in the booke of the Law, to doe them. Gal. 3. 10. This Ground must be holdē against the Church of Rome: who in her Case-diuinitie, vseth to pacifie the conscience, by teaching men, that sundry sinnes are veniall. Sect. 10. Now though euery sinne of it selfe be mortall, yet all are not equally mortall: but some more, some lesse. For the better vnder∣standing whereof, it is to be remembred, that in Sinne there be sundrie steppes & degrees, whereby one and the same sinne, may be les∣sened or increased, and so become more or lesse hainous before God. If it be asked, how can this be? I answer, that Sinne may admit aggrauation, or exte∣nuation, sundrie waies. First, by the Circum∣stances, which are principally seauen. The first, is the subiect, or person sinning. For example: The sinne of a publike person, is more hainous, yea more mortall, then the sinne of a priuate man, because he is in emi∣nent place, and his actions are more exem∣plarie and scandalous, then the actions of inferiour men. The seruant, that knowes his masters will, if he doth it not, is the greater sin∣ner,
and shall endure a greater punishment, then he that neglects the same vpon simple ignorance, Matth. 10. 15. The Minister and Dispenser of the Word, if he be vnfaithfull and vnprofitable, his offence, and conse∣quently his punishment, is farre greater then other mens, Matth. 5. 13. The second is, the obiect or partie which is offended. In this respect it was that the Iewes did more hainously sinne in cruci∣fying Christ the sonne of God, the Lord of glorie, then did their fathers which persequu∣ted and killed the Prophets. Againe, the word of God teacheth that the iniurie that is don vnto those whome God tenderly loueth, is farre more displeasing vnto him, then if it were done to others. He that toucheth you (saies the Prophet, meaning the Iewes his chosen and beloued people) toucheth the apple of his eye, Zach. 3. 8. The man that deuiseth mischiefe against his harmelesse brother that dwelleth peaceably by him, committeth a sinne most odious vnto God and man, Prov. 3. 29. Psal. 7. 4. He that is called and conuerted vn∣to God and Christ, and maketh not honest prouision for his owne, which are of his familie, is so notorious an offender, that S. Paul holds him a deier of the faith, and worse then an In∣sidel, 1. Tim. 5. 8. The person that shall ralle vpon the Iudge, or speake euill of the Ruler of his people, is a greater transgressour of Gods commandement, then he that reuileth, or a∣buseth
an ordinarie man, Exod. 23. 28. The third is, the Thing done in which the offence is cōmitted. Thus, to falsifie the word of God, and to prophane his worship and Seruice, is much more abominable in his sight, then is the falsifying of the word of a man, or the abuse of humane lawes and ordinances. Thus againe, the hurting and indamaging of the person and life of our neighbour, is a more odious offence, then is the diminishing of his goods and outward estate: and the hurt that redoundeth by our default vnto his soule, is more offensiue euery way, then the wrong that is offered vnto his bodie. The fourth, is the Place where it is done. According to this Circumstance, if a man shall either speake or doe any thing, that comes vnder the name of a breach of pietie or iustice, in publike place, as in the congrega∣tion, in open court, or generall assemblie, and that with publike and generall scandall: he is a greater offendour, then if he spake or did the same at home, in his house or closet. The fift is the End. In regard hereof, he that stealeth from another, that whereby he may satisfie his hunger, and saue his life, bee∣ing driuen to extreame necessitie: offendeth in a lower and lesser degree, then the theefe that robbeth by the high way side, for this ende, to enrich himselfe by the losses of other men. The sixt is the Manner how? Thus he that
committeh vncleannesse in the outward act, doeth more grieuously sinne, and with grea∣ter scandall, then if he onely entertained an vncleane thought into his heart. And he that sinneth of set purpose and presumption, or of obstinate and resolued malice against God, hath proceeded vnto a higher degree of iniquitie, then if he had fallen vpon igno∣rance, infirmity, or disordered and distempe∣red affection. In like manner, the sinne of the Iewes, in forcing. Pilate by their threatning tearmes (as that he was an enemie to Caesar, &c.) to the vniust condemnation of Christ Iesus, was an higher degree, then the sinne of Pilate himselfe, who yelding vnto their im∣portnitie, pronounced sentence against him, Ioh. 19. 11. The last is the Time, which also serues to aggrauate the sinne. For ordi∣narie disobedience in the time of grace, and wilfull neglect of gods calling, in the aboun∣dance of meanes, is a great deale more dam∣nable, then the commission of sin, in the daies of ignorance and blindnesse, when the like 2. Pet. 2. 21. meanes are wanting. The Second way to aggrauate sinne, is by addition of sin to sin: and that is done sundry waies: first, by committing one sinne in the necke of an other; as Dauid sinned, when he added murther to adulterie. Secondly, by doubling and multiplying of sinne, that is, by falling often into the same sinne. Third∣ly, by lying in sinne without repentance. And
here it must be remembred, that men of yeares liuing in the Church, are not simply condemned for their particular sinnes; but for their continuance and residence in them. Sinnes committed make men worthie of damnation; but liuing and abiding in them without repentance, is the thing that brings damnation. For as in the militant Church, men are excommunicate, not so much for their offence, as for their obstinacie; so shall it be in the church triumphant; the kingdom of heauen shall be barred against men, not so much for their sinne committed, as for their lying therin without repentance. And this is the manner of Gods dealing with those that haue liued within the precincts of the church; they shall be condemned for the very want of true faith and repentance. This should ad∣monish euery one of vs, to take heed, least we lie in any sin: and that being any way o∣uertaken, we should speedily repent, least we aggrauate our sinne by continuance therein, and so bring vpon our selues swift damnati∣on. Thirdly, the same sinne is made greater or lesser foure waies! according to the number of degrees in the committing of a sinne, no∣ted by S. Iames, Temptation, Conception, Birth, Iam. 1. 15. and Perfection. Actual sinne in the first degree of tentation, is when the minde vpon some sudden motion, is drawne away to thinke e∣uill, and withall is tickled with some delight
thereof. For a bad motion cast into the mind, by the flesh and the deuill, is like vnto the baite cast into the water, that allureth and delighteth the fish, and causeth it to bite. Sin in conception, is when with the delight of the minde, there goes consent of will to doe the euill thought on. Sinne in birth, is when it comes forth into an action or execution. Sin in perfection, is when men are growne to a cu∣stome and habit in sin, vpon long practise. For the often committing of one and the same sinne, leaues an euill impression in the heart, that is, a strong or violent inclination, to that or any other euill, as hath bin taught before. And sinne thus made perfect, brings forth death: for custome in sinning brings hardnes of heart: hardnes of heart, impeni∣tencie: and impenitencie, condemnation. Now of these degrees, the first is the least, & the last is the greatest. One and the same sin, is lesser in tentation, then in conception: & lesse in conception, then in birth: and greater in perfection, then in all the former. Sect. 11. Now from this doctrine of the increasing and lessening of Sin in these respects, we may gather, that all sins are not alike or equall, as the Stoicks of auncient times, and their fol∣lowers haue falsely imagined. For it hath bin prooued at large, by induction of sundrie
particulars, that there are degrees of sinnes, some lesser, som greater: some more offensiue and odious to God & man, some lesse. And hat the circumstances of time, place, person, and manner of doing, doe serue to enlarge or extenuate the sinne commited. If it be here alleadged, that Sin is nothing but the doing of that, which is vnlawfull to be done, and that this is equall in all men that sinne: and therfore by consequent, offences are equall. I answer, that in euery sin, mē must not consider the vnlawfulnes thereof onely, but the reason why it should be vnlawfull: and that is properly, because it is a breach of Gods law, and repugnant to his will reuealed in his word. Nowe there is no breach of a diuine Law, but it is more or lesse repugnant vnto the will of the Lawgiuer, God himselfe. And many transgressions, are more repugnāt thereunto then fewer: for the more sin is in∣creased, the more is the wrath of God inla∣med against the sinner vpon his due de∣sert. If it be said againe, that the nature of Sin stands onely in this, that the sinner makes an aberration from the scope or marke that is set before him, and doth no more then passe the bondes of dutie prescribed by God, and that all are alike in this respect; The answer is, that it is a falshood to affirme, that he which makes the lesse aberration from the dutie commanded, is equall in offence to him
that makes the greater. For the same sin for substance, hath sundrie steps and degrees, in respect whereof, one man becommeth a more heinous offender then another. For ex∣ample, in the seauenth commandemēt when God forbiddes the committing of Adultery, he forbiddeth three degrees of the same sinne; to wit, adulterie of the heart, consisting of inordinate and vncleane affections; adul∣terie of the tongue in corrupt, dishonest, and vnseemely speeches; and the very act of vn∣cleannesse and filthinesse committed by the bodie. Now it cannot be said, that he which breakes this commandement onely in the first degree, is as great a transgressour, as he that hath proceeded to the second, and so to the third. And therefore it remaines for an vndoubted truth, that Sinnes commit∣ted against the Law of God are not equall, but some lesser, some greater. Sundrie other Distinctions there are of sinnes; as namely, That the main sinnes of the first Table, are greater then the maine sins of the second Table. And yet the maine sinnes of the second, are greater then the breach of ceremoniall duties, against the first table. But this which hath beene said shall suf∣fice. The vse of this doctrine is manifold. First, by it we learne, what the heart of man is by nature: namely, a corrupt and vncleane foun∣taine, out of which issueth in the course of
this life, the streames of corruptions infinite in number, noysome in qualities, hainous in degrees, dāgerous in effects. For from thence doe flow, all the differences of sinnes before named, with their seuerall branches, and in∣finite many more, that cannot be rehearsed. This must mooue vs humbly to sue vnto God, & earnestly to entreat him, to wash vs throughly from our wickednes, & clense vs from our sinnes: yea to purge and to rinse the fountaine thereof, our vncleane and polluted hearts. And when by Gods mercie in Christ, apprehended by faith, our hearts shall be purified, thē to set watch & ward ouer them, Act. 15. 9. and to keep them with all diligence. Second∣ly it teacheth vs, that miserable mortal man, Pro. 4. 23. is not guiltie of one or more sinnes, but of many & sundrie corruptions, both of heart and life. Who can vnderstand his faults? saith Dauid. Now the alowance of sinne beeing Psal. 19. 12. death by gods ordināce, & God being iustice it selfe: answerably to the number of our of∣fences, must we needes be lyable to many punishments, yea to death it selfe, both of the bodie and of the soule. This beeing our wofull estate, little cause is there, that any man should thinke himselfe to be in good case, or presume of Gods mercie in regard of the small number of his sinnes. And much lesse cause hath he, falsly to imagine with the Popish sort, that he can merit the fauour of God by any worke done by him, aboue that
which the Law requireth; considering that it is impossible for him to know either the number, or the nature, or the measure of his sinnes. Lastly, the consideration of this point, must be a barre to keepe vs in, that we be not too secure or presumptuous of our owne e∣state: for as much as we learne out of the word of god, that in respect of the multitude of our corruptions, this our life is full of much euill, and many difficulties, that wee haue whole armies of enemies to encounter with all, not onely out of vs in the world a∣broad, but within vs, lurking euen in our owne flesh. And vpon this consideration, that we should be at cōtinuall defiance with them, vsing all holy meanes to get the victo∣rie ouer them, by the daily exercises of inuo∣cation and repentance, and by a continuall practise of new obedience, vnto all the lawes and commandements of God, according to the measure of grace receiued. And so much of the third Ground. CHAP. III. Of the subiection and power of Conscience. THe fourth and last Ground, is touching the subiection and power of Conscience. Wherein we are to remember two things: what Conscience is; and what is the naturall
condition of it in every man. For the first; the name of Conscience will giue light to the thing it selfe. For it signifieth a knowledge ioyned with a knowledge; and it is so tear∣med in two respects. First, because when a man knowes or thinks any thing, by meanes of Conscience, he knows what he knowes & thinks. Secondly, because by it, man knowes that thing of himselfe, which God also knowes of him. Man hath two witnesses of his thoughtes, God, and his owne consci∣ence; God is the first and chiefest; and Con∣science is the second subordinate vnto God, bearing witnes vnto God either with the man or against him. Therefore it is nothing els but a part of the vnderstanding, whereby a man knowes what he thinkes, what he wills and desires, as also in what manner he know∣eth, thinketh, or willeth, either good or euill. Wherevnto this must be added, that as con∣sciēce knowes our thoughts, wils, & actions, so it testifies thereof vnto God, either with vs, or against vs. In the second place, The naturall condi∣tion or propertie of euery mans conscience is this; that in regard of authoritie and pow∣er, it is placed in the middle betweene man and God, so as it is vnder God and yet a∣boue man. And this naturall condition hath two parts: the first is the Subiection of con∣science to God and his word. Concerning which subiection we haue this rule: That
God alone by his word doth onely bind the conscience, by causing it in euerie action either to excuse for well doeing, or accuse for sinne. And this God doth properly. For first, he is the onely Lord of the conscience, which created it, and gouernes it. 2. Againe, he is the only Law-giuer, that hath power to saue or destroy the soule, for the keeping & brea∣king of his Lawes, Iam. 4. 12. 3. And fur∣ther, mans conscience is knowne to none, besides himselfe, but to God: What man knoweth the things of a man, saue the spirit of a man which is in him? 1. Cor. 2. 11. And it is God onely that giues liberty to the con∣science, in regard of his owne lawes. Vpon this it followeth, that no mans commande∣ment or Law can of it selfe, and by it owne soueraigne power bind conscience, but doth it onely by the authoritie and vertue of the written word of God, or some part thereof. And therefore if it be alleadged, that sub∣iection is due to the Magistrate for consci∣ence sake, Rom. 13. 5. the Answer is at hand; that subiection is indeede to be performed to ciuill authoritie ordained by God, and o∣bediēce also to the Lawes of the Magistrate for feare of wrath, and for auoiding of pu∣nishment, but not for conscience of the said authoritie or lawes properly and directly, but for conscience of Gods commandemēt, which appointeth both Magistracie, and the authoritie thereof. This is it that bindes the
conscience immediatly; that by vertue of a superiour Law, whereby it standeth in force, namely the Law of God. The Second part of the naturall condition of conscience, is the Power which it hath o∣uer man to accuse or excuse him in respect of things done. And this is plaine by Saint Pauls Conclusion, Whatsoeuer is not of faith, Rom. 14. . that is, whatsoeuer man doth, whereof he is not certenly perswaded in judgement and conscience, out of Gods word, that the thing may be done, it is sinne. More plainely: a thing may be said, not to be done of faith three waies. First, whē it is done with doub∣ting, 1 Dubitate conscientiā. and vnresolued conscience, as in those that are weake in knowledge. Of which sort were some in the Primitiue church, who notwithstanding they heard of the doctrine of Christian libertie, yet they were of opini∣on, that after Christs ascension, there was a difference to be made of meates, and there∣upon thought, they might not eate of some kind of meats. Suppose now, that these per∣sons (by accident) should haue been drawne to eate swines flesh, which themselues had holden a thing forbidden. These men vpon this very fact had sinned, because that which they did, was vpon an vnresolued conscience. So saith the Apostle, Rom. 14. 23. He that doubteth, is condemned, if he eate, because he eateth not of faith. Secondly, when a thing is done vpon an erronious 2 rrante.
conscience, it is not of faith, and therefore it is a sinne. Thus the Masse-Priest sinneth in saying Masse, though he thinke in his con∣science, the thing he doth, is the ordinance of God. And thus Heretikes doe die Here∣tikes, though when they die, they be fully perswaded there opinions be the truth. A∣gaine in the same manner; Put the case a man should be of opinion, that fornication, or theft, were things arbitrarie and indiffe∣rent, and hereupon his conscience should tel him he might take opportunitie, and com∣mit either of these sinnes; whether is this action in the partie thus perswaded, a sinne or no? I answer, the case is plaine, that the fact is done vpon an erronious consci∣ence, and therefore must be a sinne in the doer. For the error of the iudgement cannot take away the nature of that which is simply euill. Sinne is sinne, and so remaineth not∣withstanding any contrarie perswasion of the consciēce. The reason is, because though the conscience erreth and is misinformed, yet it bindeth so farre forth, as that if a man iudge a thing to be euill, either simply or in some respect, (though falsely) and yet after∣ward doth it, he hath sinned and offended the Maiestie of God, as much as in him lieth. Thirdly, when a thing as done with a repug∣ning 3 Repugnant. or gainsaying conscience, though vpon error and false iudgement of the conscience, it is in the doer a sinne. Thus an Anabap∣tist,
that holdeth it vnlawfull to sweare, sin∣neth if he take an oath; not in swearing simp∣ly, for that is Gods ordinance, but because he sweares against the perswasion of his Con∣science. CHAP. IIII. Of the distinction of Cases. THus much touching the Preambles, or Grounds of this doctrine. Now it re∣maineth that we come to the Questions of Consci∣ence. These Questions may be fitly deuided, according to the matter or subiect of them, which is Man. Now as Man is considered diuers waies, that is to say, ei∣ther a part y himselfe; or as he stands in re∣lation to an other, and is a member of a So∣cietie: so the Questions of Conscience are to be distinguished; some concerning man simply considered by himselfe: some againe, as he stands in relation to an other. Man standeth in a twofold relation: to God, or to Man. As he stands in relation to God, he beares the name of a Christian, that is, a member of Christ, or a sonne of God, whose dutie is to know and to worship God
according to his will reuealed in his word. As he stands in relation to man, he is a part of a bodie, and a member of some societie. Now the Questions that concerne him, as a member of a societie, are of three sorts, ac∣cording to three distinct kinds of societies. For euery man is either a member of a Fa∣milie, or of the Church, or of the Common∣wealth. And answerably, some Questions concerne mā as a member of a familie: some as he is a member of the Church: some as he is a member of the Commonwealth. In a word therefore, all Questions touch∣ing man, may be reduced to three generall heads. The first whereof is, concerning man simply considered as he is a man. The se∣cond, touching man as he stands in relation to God. The third, concerning man as he is a member of one of the three societies, that is, either of the Familie, or of the Church, or of the Commonwealth. QVestions of the first sort, concerning man simply considered in himselfe as he is a man, are especially three. The first, What a man must doe, that he may come into the fauour of God, and be saued? The second, How he may be assured in conscience of his owne saluation?
The third, How he may recouer himselfe, when he is distressed or fallen? Of these in order. CHAP. V. Of the first maine Question tou∣ching Man. I. Question. What must a man doe, that he may come into Gods fauor, and be saued? FOR answer to this Question, some Groundes must be laid downe before∣hand. The first is this; That we must consider and remember, how and by what meanes, God brings any man to saluation. For looke how God saueth others; so he that would know how to be saued, must vse the meanes whereby God saueth them. Sect. 1. In the working and effecting of Mans sal∣uation, How God sa∣ueth man. ordinarily there are two special acti∣ons of God: the giuing of the first grace, and after that, the giuing of the second. The for∣mer of these two works, hath X. seuerall a∣ctions. I. God giues man the outward
meanes of saluation, specially the Ministerie of the word: and with it, he sends some out∣ward or inward crosse, to breake and sub due the stubbornnesse of our nature, that it may be made plyable to the will of God. This we may see in the example of the Iaylour, Act. 16. and of the Iewes that were conuer∣ted at Peters sermon, Act. 2. II. This done, God brings the minde of man to a conside∣ration of the Law, and therein generally to see what is good, and what is euill, what is sinne, and what is not sinne. III. Vpon a se∣rious consideration of the Law, he makes a man particularly to see and know, his owne peculiar and proper sinnes, whereby he of∣fends God. IV. Vpon the sight of sinne, he smites the heart with a Legall feare, whereby when man seeth his sinnes, he makes him to feare punishment and hell, and to despaire of saluation, in regard of any thing in him∣selfe. Now these foure actions, are indeede no fruits of grace, for a Reprobate may goe thus farre; but they are onely workes of preparation going before grace; the other actions which follow, are effects of grace. V. The fifth a∣ction of grace therefore is, to stirre vp the minde to a serious consideration, of the pro∣mise of saluation propounded and publish∣ed in the Gospel. VI. After this, the sixt is, to kindle in the heart, some seedes or sparks of faith, that is, a will and desire to beleeue,
and grace to striue against doubting & dis∣paire. Now at the same instant, when God beginnes to kindle in the heart, any sparkes of faith, then also he iustifies the sinner, and withall begins the worke of sanctification. VII. Then, so soone as faith is put into the heart, there is presently a combat: for it figh∣teth with doubting, dispaire, and distrust. And in this combate, faith shews it selfe, by feruent, cōstant, & earnest inuocatiō for par∣don: and after inuocation followes a strength and preuailing of this desire. VIII. Further∣more, God in mercie quiets and settles the Conscience, as touching the saluation of the soule, and the promise of life, where vpon it resteth and staieth it selfe. IX. Next after this setled assurance, & perswasion of mercy, followes a stirring vp of the heart to Euan∣gelicall sorrow, according to God, that is, a griefe for sinne, because it is sinne, and be∣cause God is offended: and then the Lord workes repentance, wherby the sanctified heart turnes it selfe vnto him. And though this repentance be one of the last in order, yet it shewes it selfe first: as when a candle is brought into a roome, we first see the light before wee see the candle, and yet the can∣dle must needs be, before the light can be. X. Lastly, God giues a man grace to endeauor, to obey his commaundements by a new o∣bedience. And by these degrees, doth the Lord giue the first grace.
The second worke of God tending to sal∣uation, is the giuing of the second grace: which is nothing else, but the continuance of the first grace giuen. For looke as by creation, God gaue a beeing to man & all o∣ther creatures, and then by his prouidence continued the same beeing, which was as it were a second creation; so in bringing a man to saluation, God giues the first grace, for ex∣ample, to beleeue & repent, & then in mercie giues the second, to persevere & continue in faith and repentance to the end. And this, if we regard man himselfe, is very necessary; For as fire without supply of matter, wherby it is fedde & continued, would soone goe out; so vnlesse God of his goodnesse, should followe his children, and by new and daily supplies, continue his first grace in thē, they would vndoubtedly soone loose the same, & finally fall away. The second Ground for the answere of this Question, is taken from some speciall places of Scripture, where the same is moo∣ved and resolued. The men that were at Pe∣ters sermon, being touched with the sense of their owne miserie, vpon the doctrine which had beene deliuered, as the Holy Ghost saies, were pricked in their hearts, and cried one to an other: Men & brethren, what shall we doe? Peter Act. 2. 38. mooued by the spirit of God answers them, Repent, and be baptized for the remission of your sinnes. The like was the case of the Iaylor,
who, after that the stubbornnesse of his heart was beaten downe, by feare of the departure of the prisoners, he came trembling, and fell downe before Paul and Silas, and mooued this question vnto them; Sirs, what must I doe Act. 16. 33. to be saued? to whome they gaue answer, Be∣leeue in the Lord Iesus, and thou shalt be saued, and thine houshold. The young man in the Go∣spel sues to Christ, and askes him, What shall I Mar. 10. 17. &c. doe to be saued? Christs answers him, Keepe the Commandements. When he replied that he had kept them from his youth, Christ tels him, that he must goe yet further, and sell all that he hath, and giue to the poore. And Iohn tells the Scribes and Pharises, who came vn∣to his Baptisme, and confessed their sinnes, that if they would flie from the wrath to come, they must repent, and bring forth fruits Matth. 3. 8. worthie amendment of life. From these places then, I frame this answer to the Question in hand. The man that would stand in the fa∣uour of God and be saued, must doe foure things: first, humble himselfe before God: secondly, beleeue in Christ: thirdly, repent of his sinnes: fourthly, performe new obedience vnto God. Sect. 2. For the first. Humiliation is indeode a Humiliation. fruit of faith: yet I put it in place before faith, because in practise it is first. Faith lieth hid in the heart, and the first effect whereby
it appeares, is the abasing and humbling of our selues. And here we are further to con∣sider three points: first, wherein stands hu∣miliation: secondly, the excellencie of it: thirdly, the Questions of conscience that concerne it. Touching the first point, Humiliation stands in the practise of three things. The first is, a sorrow of heart, whereby the sinner is displeased with himself, & ashamed in respect of his sinnes. The second is, a confession to god, wherin also three things are to be done: first, to acknowledge all our maine sinnes o∣riginall and actuall: secondly, to acknow∣ledge our guiltinesse before God: thirdly, to acknowledge our iust damnation for sinne. The third thing in Humiliation, is supplicati∣on made to God for mercie, as earnestly as in a matter of life and death: and of these three things we haue in Scripture the examples of Ezra, Daniel, and the prodigall sonne, Ezra 9. Dan. 9. Luk. 15. 18. The second point is, the excellencie of Humiliation, which stands in this, that it hath the promises of life eternall annexed to it, Esa. 57. 15. I dwell in the high and holy place: with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to giue life to them that are of a contrite heart. Psal. 51. 17. A contrite and a broken heart, O God, thou wilt not despise. Prov. 28. 13. He that hideth his sinnes shall not prosper: but he that
confesseth and forsaketh them, shall finde mercie, 1. Ioh. 1. 9. If we acknowledge our sinnes, he is faithfull and iust, to forgiue vs our sinnes, and to clense vs from all vnrighteousnes. By all these and many other places, it is manifest, that in the very instant, when a sinner beginnes tru∣ly in heart and conscience to humble him∣selfe, he is then entred into the state of salua∣tion. So soone as Dauid said, I haue sinned, 2. Sam. 12, 13. Nathan pronounceth in the name of the Lord, that his sinnes were put away. And Dauid himselfe saith, alluding to the former place, I said I will confesse my sinne, and loc, Psal. 32. 5. thou forgauest the wickednes of my sinne. When the Prodigall sonne had but said, I will goe to Luk. 15. 18. my father, &c. euen then, before he humbled himselfe, his father meetes him, and receiues him. The third point, is touching the Questi∣ons of conscience, concerning Humiliation, all which may be reduced to foure principall Cases. I. Case. What if it fall out, that a man in humbling himselfe, cannot call to minde ei∣ther all, or the most of his sinnes? I answer; A particular humiliation indeed is required, for maine and knowne sinnes: but yet there are two cases, wherein generall repentance, will be accepted of God for vnknowne sinnes. One is, when a man hath searched himselfe diligently, and by a serious examination, pas∣sed through all the commaundements of
God, and yet after such examination and search made, his particular offences are yet hidden and not reuealed vnto him, so as he cannot call them to remembrance; then the generall repentance is accepted. For this is answerable to the practise of Dauid, who af∣ter long search, when he could not attaine to the knowledge of his particular slippes, then he addresseth himselfe to a generall humiliation, saying, Who knoweth the errours of Psal. 19. 12. this life? clense me, Lord, from my secret faults: and vpon this, he was no doubt accepted. Againe, when a man humbleth himselfe, and yet is preuented by the time, so as he cannot search his heart and life, as he would: his ge∣nerall repentance will be taken and accep∣ted of God. The truth hereof appeares in the theefe vpon the crosse, who hauing no time to search himselfe, made no speciall humili∣ation, yet vpon his generall confession he was accepted. Now the ground of this do∣ctrine is this; He that truly repents of one sinne, in this case when he is preuented: is, as if he repented of all. II. Case. What must a man doe, that findes himselfe hard hearted, and of a dead spirit, so as he cannot humble himselfe as he would? Answ. Such persons, if they humble themselues, they must be content with that grace which they haue receiued. For if thou be truly and vnfainedly grieued for this, that thou canst not be grieued, thy hu∣miliation
shall be accepted. For that which Paul saith of almes, may be truly said in this case, that if there be a readie minde, a man shall be accepted, according to that he hath, and not 2. Cor. 8. 12. according to that he hath not. III. Case. Whether the party that is more grieued for losse of his friend, then for offēce of God by his sinne, doeth or can truly hum∣ble himselfe? Answ. A man may haue a grea∣ter griefe for an earthly losse, then for the o∣ther, and yet be truly greiued for his sinnes too. The reason is, because that is a bodily, naturall, and sensible losse, and accordingly sorrow for it is naturall. Now the sorrow for the offending of God, is no sensible thing, but supernaturall and spirituall; and sensible things doe more affect & urge the minde, then the other. Dauid did notably humble himselfe for his sinnes, and he did excee∣dingly mourne for the losse of his sonne Absolom, yea and more too then for his sinnes, Would God I had died for thee Absolom, O 2. Sam. 18. 33. Absolom my sonne, my sonne, &c. Againe I an∣swer, that the sorrow of the minde, must be measured by the intention of the affection, & by the estimation of the thing for which we sorrow. Now sorrow for sinne, though it be lesse in respect of the intention thereof; yet is it greater in respect of the estimation of the mind, because they which truly mourn for their sins, grieue for the offence of God, as the greatest euill of all; and for the losse of
the fauour of God, as for losse of the most ex∣cellent & pretious thing in the world. IV. Case. Whether it be necessarie in Hu∣miliation, that the heart should be smitten with a sensible sorrow? Answer. I. In sorrow for sinne, ther are two things: first, to be dis∣pleased for our sinns; secondly, to haue a bo∣dily moouing of the heart, which causeth crying and teares. The former of these is ne∣cessarie, namely, in heart to be deepely dis∣pleased with our selues: the latter is not sim∣ply necessary, though it be commendable in whomsoeuer it is, if it be in truth; for Lydia had the first, but not the second. II. It falleth out oftētimes, that the greatnes of the grief, taketh away the sensible paine, and causeth a mummednesse of the heart, so that the par∣tie grieueth not. III. Sometimes the com∣plexion will not affoard teares: and in such there may be true humiliation, though with dric cheekes. Sect. 3. The Secōd thing to be done for the attai∣ning Faith in Christ. of Gods fauour, and confequently of saluatiō, is to Beleeue in Christ. In the practise of a Christian life, the duties of humiliation & faith cannot be seuered, yet for doctrines sake, I distinguish them. In Faith ther are two things required, and to be performed on our behalfe. First, to know the points of religion, and namely the summe of
the Gospel, especially the promise of righte∣ousnes and life eternall by Christ. Secondly, to apprehend and applie the promise, and withall the thing promised, which is Christ, vnto our selues; and this is done, when a man vpon the commandemēt of God, sets down this with himselfe, that Christ and his merits belong vnto him in particular, and that Christ is his wisdome, iustification, sanctifi∣cation, and redemption. This doctrine is plaine out of the sixt of Iohn: for Christ is there propounded vnto vs, as the bread and the water of life. Therefore faith must not be idle in the braine, but it must take Christ and applie him vnto the soule and conscience, e∣uen as meate is eaten. The Questions of Conscience touching Faith are these. First, how we may truly applie Christ, with all his benefits vnto our selues? For wicked men applie Christ vnto them∣selues falsely, in presumption, but fewe doe it truly, as they ought to doe. I answer, That this may be done, we must remember to doe two things. First, lay downe a foundation of this action, and then practise vpon it. Our foundation must be laid in the word, or else we shall faile in our application, and it con∣sists of two principles. The one is; As God giues a promise of life eternall by Christ, so he giues commandement, that euery one in particular, should applie the promise to him∣selfe. The next is, that the Ministerie of the
word, is an ordinarie meanes, wherein God doth offer, and applie Christ with all his be∣nefits to the hearers, as if he called them by their names; Peter, Iohn, Cornelius, Beleeue in Christ, and thou shalt be saued. When we haue rightly considered of our foundation: the Second thing is, to practise vpon it, and that is, to giue our selues to the exercises of faith and repentance; which stand in meditation of the Word, and prayer for mercie and pardon: and when this is done, then God giues the sense and increase of his grace. When Lydia was hearing the Sermon of Paul, then God opened her heart, Act. 16. v. 12. Secondly, it is demaunded: When faith beginnes to breede in the heart, and when a man beginnes to beleeue in Christ? Answ. When he beginnes to be touched in consci∣ence for his owne sinnes, and withall hun∣gers and thirsts after Christ, and his righte∣ousnes, then beginneth faith. The reason is plaine. As faith is renewed, so it is begunne; but it is renewed when a man is touched in conscience for his sinnes, and beginnes a new to hunger after Christ; therefore when these things first shew themselues, then faith first beginnes. For these were the things that were in Dauid, when he renewed his repen∣tance. Psal. 51.
Sect. 4. The third dutie necessarie to saluation, is Repentance. Repentance. In which, two things are to be considered; the beginning, namely, a godly Sorrow, which is the beginning of Repen∣tance, 2. Corinth. 7. and vpon this sorrow a Change, which is indeede Repentance it selfe. In Sorrow we consider, first, the nature of it; secondly, the properties of it. Touch∣ing the nature of sorrow, it is either inward or outward. The inward sorrow, is when a man is displeased with himselfe for his sinnes. The outward, when the heart declares the griefe thereof by teares, or such like signes. And sorrow in this case, called a god∣ly sorrow, is more to be esteemed by the first of these, then by the second. The propertie of this sorrow, is to make vs to be displeased with our selues, for our sinnes directly, be∣cause they are sinnes, and doe displease God. If there were no iudge, no hel, nor death, yet we must be grieued because we haue offen∣ded, so mercifull a God and louing father. And as godly sorrow will make vs thus to doe, so is it the next cause of repentance, and by this is repentance discerned. The next thing in Repentāce, is the Change of the minde and whole man in affection, life, and conuersation. And this standeth in a constant purpose of the minde, and resoluti∣on of the heart, not to sinne, but in euery
thing to doe the will of God. Hereupon Paul exhorteth them, to whome he wrote, to continue in the loue of God, and in the o∣bedience Act. 11. 23. of his word. Barnabas when he came to Antioch, and had seene the grace of God, was glad, and exhorted all, that with pur∣pose of heart they should cleaue vnto God, or conti∣nue with the Lord. So the Prophet Ezckiel saith, if the wicked will turne from all his sinnes, Ezek. 18. 21. and keepe all my statutes, and doe that which is lawfull and right, he shall surely liue and shall not die. In this purpose stands the very nature of repentance, and it must be ioyned with humiliation and faith, as a third thing auaile∣able to saluation, and not to be seuered from them. For a man in shewe may haue many good things: as for example, he may be humbled, and seeme to haue some strength of faith; yet if there be in the saide man, a want of this purpose and resolution not to sinne, the other are but dead things, and vn∣profitable, and for all them, he may come to eternall destruction. Furthermore, we must distinguish this kinde of purpose, from the minde and purpose of carnall men, theeues, drunkards, harlots, vsurers; for they will con∣fesse their sinnes, and be sorie for them, yea and shed some teares, wishing they had ne∣uer sinned as they haue. In these men, indeed there is a wishing will for the time, but no setled purpose. And it is a propertie of na∣ture to auoid euill, but to haue a constant re∣solution
of not sinning, is a gift of grace; and for this it is, that we must labour; otherwise our repentance, is no true and sound repen∣tance. Sect. 5. The fourth and last dutie, is to performe New Obedi∣ence. New obedience vnto God in our life and conuer∣sation. In this new obedience, three things are required. First, it must be a fruit of the spirit Ioh. 15. 5. of Christ in vs: for when we doe any good thing, it is Christ that doth it in vs. To this purpose Dauid praies vnto God, Psal. 143. 10. Let thy good Spirit lead me forth into the land of righteousnes. And Paul exhorts the Ga∣latians to walke in the Spirit; and then marke what followes; and ye shall not fulfill the lusts of the flesh, Gal. 5. 16. Secondly, this new obe∣dience must be the keeping of euery com∣mandement of God: for as S. Iames saith, He that breakes one commandement, is guiltie of all, Iam. 2. 10. that is, he that doth willingly and wittingly breake any commandement, and makes not conscience of some one, maketh not consci∣ence of any, and before God he is as guiltie of all, as if he had broken all. Thirdly, in new obedience, the whole man must endeauour to keepe the whole law in his minde, will, affections, and all the faculties of soule and bodie. As it is said of Iosiah, that he turned to God, according to all the lawes of Moses, with all 2. king. 23. 25. his heart. This last point added to the rest is
the very forme and life of new obedience, & from hence it followes; First, that therepen∣tant person, must not liue in the practise of any outward sinne. Secondly, that there must be in him, an inward resisting and restraining of the corruption of nature, and of the heart, that he may truly obey God, by the grace of the spirit of God. The heart of Ioseph was Gen. 39. 9. 10. readie prest, to resist the euill request of Poti∣phars wife. And Dauid staid his affectiō from 2. Sam. 1. 1. reuenging himselfe vpon Shemei, when he cursed him. Thirdly, that he ought to stirre vp and exercise the inward man, by all spiritual motions of Faith, Ioy, Loue, Hope, and the praise of God. Now touching this point, there are 2. prin∣cipal Questions propoūded. First, How may a man frame his life to liue in New-bedience? Ans. Though all the bookes of the old and new Testament, are direction sufficient for a good life; yet a more speciall answer may be made out of the same, plainly and briefly. That, there are three maine grounds or rules of New Obedience. The first is laid downe by our Sauiour Christ, Luk. 9. 23. If any man will come after me, let him denie himselfe, and take vp his crosse, and follow me. The meaning is this; Euery one that will become a scholer in the schoole of Christ, and learn obedience vnto God, must deny himselfe, that is, he must in the first place, exalt and magnifie the grace of God, and become nothing in himselfe, re∣nouncing
his owne reason, will, & affections, and subiecting them to the wisdome & will of God in all things; yea esteeming al things in the earth, euen those that are dearest vnto him, as drosse and dung in regard of the kingdome of Christ. Againe, he must take vp his Crosse, that is, he ought alwaies to make a forehand reckoning, euen of priuate crosses and particular afflictions, and when they come, to beare them with chearefulnesse. This done, he must follow Christ, by practising the vertues of meekenes, patience, loue, and obedience, and by beeing conformable to his death, in crucifying the bodie of sinne in himselfe. The second rule is propounded by Paul, Act. 24. 14. To beleeue all things that are written in the Law and the Prophets; and that is, to hold and embrace the same faith, which was embraced by the Saints and ser∣uants of God in auncient times, and which was written by Moses and the Prophets. A∣gaine, in all reuerence to subiect himselfe, to the true manner of worshipping and seruing God, reuealed in his word; and not to de∣part from the same doctrine and worship, ei∣ther to the right hand, or to the left. The third and last rule, is to haue and to keepe faith and a good conscience, 1. Tim. 1. 19. Now faith is preserued, by knowledge of the doctrine of the Law and the Gospel, by yeelding as∣sent vnto the same doctrine, beleeuing it to be true, and by a particular application of it
vnto a mans selfe, specially of the promise of righteousnesse and life euerlasting, in and by Christ. Againe, that a man may keepe a good conscience, he must doe three things. First, in the course of his life, he must practise the duties of the generall Calling in the par∣ticular; so as though they be two distinct in nature, yet they may be both one in vse and practise. Secondly, in all euents that come to passe, euermore in patience and silence he must submit himselfe, to the good will and pleasure of God. Thus it is saide of Aaron, that when God had destroied his sonnes, for offering vp strange fire before him, he held his peace, Levit. 10. 3. And Dauid shewes that it was his practise, when beeing afflicted, he saith, I was as dumbe, and opened not my mouth, because thou, Lord, didst it, Psal. 39. 9. Thirdly, if at any time he falleth, either through in∣firmitie, the malice of Satan, or the violence of some temptation, he must humble him∣selfe before God, labour to breake off his sinne, and recouer himselfe by repentance. And these three, be the principall and maine grounds of New-obedience. The Second Question. Considering that all good works, are the fruits of a regenerate person, and are contained vnder New-obe∣dience; How may a man doe a good worke, that may be accepted of God, and please him? For resolution whereof, it is to be careful∣ly
remembred, that to the doing of a good worke, sundrie things are required: Where∣of, some in nature doe goe before the worke to be done, some doe accompanie the doing thereof, and some againe doe follow the worke, beeing required to be done, when the worke is done. Before the worke, there must goe Recon∣ciliation; whereby the person is reconciled vnto God in Christ, and made acceptable to him For it is a cleare case, that no worke of man cā be accepted of God, vnles the person of the worker be approoued of him. And the workes of men of what dignitie soeuer, are not to be esteemed by the shewe, and out∣ward appearance of them, but by the minde and condition of the doer. Againe, before we doe any good worke, we must by praier lift vp our hearts vnto God, and desire him to inable vs by his spirit to doe it, and to guide vs by the same, in the action, which we are about to doe. This did the Prophet Dauid oftentimes, as we may read in the Psalmes, but especially in Psal. 143. 10. when he saith, Teach me to doe thy will, O God, for thou art my God, let thy good spirit ld me vnto the land of righteousnes. And oftentimes in the 119. Psalme. Teach me, O Lord, the way of thy statutes, vers. 33. Giue me vnderstanding. 34. Direct me in the path of thy commandements. 35. Againe, Teach me iudgement and knowledge. 66. Let my heart be vpright in thy statutes. 80.
Stablish me, according to thy promise, 116. Di∣rect my steppes in thy word, and let none iniquitie haue dominion ouer me. 133. In the doing of the worke, we are to con∣sider two things; the matter, and the man∣ner or forme of doing it. For the matter, it must be a worke commanded in the word of God, either expressely or generally. For it is Gods reuealed will that giues the goodnes to any worke. Christ saith of the Pharises, that they worshipped him in vaine, teaching for doctrines, the commandements of men. He there∣fore Mark. 7. 7. that will doe a worke, tending to the worship of God, must doe that which God commandeth. Now actions expressely com∣manded, are the duties of the morall Law; Actions generally commanded, are all such as serue to be helpes and meanes, to further the said morall duties. And here we must re∣member, that actions indifferent in the case of offence, or edification, cease to be indiffe∣rent, and come vnder some commandement of the morall Law. To which purpose Paul saith, If eating flesh will offend my brother, I will 1. Cor. 8. vlt. eate no flesh while the world standeth; his mea∣ning is, that though his eating of flesh, was a thing indifferent in it selfe; yet in case of of∣fence, his minde was to abstaine from it, as much as from the breach of the Law of God. Againe, if an action indifferent, comes within the case, of furthering the good of the Commonwealth, or Church, it ceaseth to
be indifferent, and comes vnder comman∣dement; and so all kind of callings and their works, though neuer so base, may be the mat∣ter of good workes. This point is to be re∣membred: for it serueth to incourage euery man, of what condition soeuer he be, in the diligent performance of the duties of his calling; as also to confute the doctrine of the Popish church, which teacheth that one∣ly almes deedes, and building or maintai∣ning of Churches and religious houses, are the matter of good works. Now to the manner or Forme of a good work, there is required Faith. For as without faith, it is impossible to please God, Hebr. 11. 6. so whatsoeuer worke is vndertaken without faith, cannot in any sort be accepta∣ble vnto him. What faith then is required in this case? I answer. First a general faith, where∣by we are perswaded that the thing to be done, may lawfully be done; and of this the Apostle speaketh when he saith, whatsoeuer is not of faith, is sinne. Secondly, a particular or iu∣stifying Rom 14. vlt. faith, which purifieth the heart, and maketh it fit to bring forth a good work: for it giues a beginning to the worke, and also couers the wants and defects thereof, by ap∣prehending and applying vnto vs, Christ and his merits. Againe, a good worke for the mā∣ner thereof, must be done in obedience. For knowing that the thing to be done, is com∣manded of God, we must haue a minde, and
intention to obey God in the thing we doe, according to his cōmandement. If it be here demanded, seeing workes must be done in obedience, how, and to what part of the word we must direct our obedience? I answer: to the Law. But howe? not considered in his rigour, but as it is qualified, mollified, and tē∣pered by the gospell: for according to the ri∣gour of the Lawe, which commandes per∣fect obedience, no man can possibly doe a good worke. Furthermore, touching the maner, it must be done to good and lawfull ends. The Ends of a good worke are manifold: First, the ho∣nour and glory of God. Whether ye eate or 2. Cor. 10. 3. drinke, or whatsoeuer ye doe, doe all to the glory of God. Secondly, the testification of our thank∣fulnes vnto God, that hath redeemed vs by Christ. The third is, to edifie our neighbour, and to further him in the way to life euerla∣sting, Math. 5. 16. Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, & glorifie your father which is in heauen. The fourth is, to exercise and increase our faith & repentance, both which be much strengthned and con∣firmed, by the practise of good workes. Fift∣ly, that we may escape the punishment of sinne, the destruction of the wicked: and ob∣taine the reward of the righteoūs, life euerla∣sting. This was the end that Paul aymed at in the course of his calling; to which purpose he saith, From henceforth there is laid vp for
me the crowne of righteousnesse, which the Lord the righteous Iudge shall giue me at that day, 2. Tim. 4. 8. Sixtly, that we may be answerable to our calling, in doeing the du∣ties thereof, and in walking as children of light, redeemed by Christ Iesus. When Dauid kept his fathers sheepe, he behaued himselfe as a sheepheard; but when he was annointed King ouer Israell, God gaue him an heart & resolution, to carry himselfe as a King & go∣uernour of his people. Looke then as Dauid did, so ought we euen by our workes to be answerable to our callings. Seuenthly, that we may pay the debt, which we owe vnto God. For we are debters to him in sundry re∣gardes; as we are his creatures: as we are his seruants: as we are his children: In a word, as we are redeemed by Christ, and our whole debt is, our dutie of praise and thanks giuing. After the worke is done, then comes the acceptation of it. God accepts of our works diuers waies. First, in that he pardoneth the fault which comes from vs. Secondly, in that he approoues his owne good worke in vs. Thirdly, in that he doth giue vnto the doers of them a crowne of righteousnes and glo∣rie, according to his promise, 2. Tim. 4. 8. Rev. 2. 10. We then, after we haue done the work, must humble our selues, and intreat the Lord to pardon the wants of our workes, and say with Dauid, Lord enter not into iudgement with Psal 143. 2. thy seruant: & with Daniel, Lord vnto vs belon∣geth Dan. 9. 8, 9.
open shame & confusiō, but to thee righteous∣nes, compassion, and forgiuenes. And the reason is plaine, because in vs there is no goodnesse, no holinesse, no righteousnes, nor any thing that may present vs acceptable in his sight: & for this cause Paul saith, I know nothing by my selfe, yet am I not therby iustified. Great reason then, that we should hūble ourselues before God, for our wants, and pray vnto him, that he will in mercie accept our indeauour, and confirme the good worke begunne in vs, by his holy spirit. CHAP. VI. Of the second maine Question touching assurance of saluation. II. Question. How a man may be in con∣science assured, of his owne sal∣uation? Before I come to the Question it selfe, this conclusion is to be laid downe as a mayne Ground; That Election, vocatiō, faith, adop∣tion,
iustificatiō, sanctification, & eternal glo∣rification, are neuer separated in the saluati∣on of any man, but like inseparable compa∣nions, go hand in hand; so as he that can be assured of one of them, may infallibly con∣clude in his owne heart, that he hath and shall haue interest in all the other in his due time. This is plaine by the words of S. Paul, Rom. 8. 30. Whome he predestinate, them also he called; whome he called, them also he iustifi∣ed; whome he iustified, them also he glorified. In which place, the Apostle compares the cau∣ses of saluation, to a chaine of many linkes, whereof euery one is so coupled to the o∣ther, that he which taketh hold of the high∣est, must needes carrie all the rest with him. Againe, amongst these linkes Faith is one, a principall grace of God, whereby man is in∣grafted into Christ, and thereby becomes one with Christ, and Christ one with him, E∣ph. 3. 17. Now whosoeuer is by faith vnited vnto Christ, the same is elected, called, iustifi∣ed, and sanctified. The reason is manifest. For in a chaine, the two extremes, are knit togi∣ther, by the middle linkes; and in the order of causes of happinesse and saluation, faith hath a middle place, and by it hath the child of God assured hold of his election, and effe∣ctuall vocation, and consequently of his glo∣rification in the kingdome of heauen. To this purpose saith S. Iohn, c. 3. v. 36. He that belee∣ueth in the Sonne, hath euerlasting life. And, c. 5.
v. 24. He that beleeues in him that sent me, hath euerlasting life, and shall not come into condem∣nation, but hath passed from death to life. This is the Ground. Now for answer to the Question, diuerse places of Scripture are to be skanned; where∣in this case of Conscience is fully answered and resolued. Sect. 1. The first place is Rom. 8. 16. And the spirit Rom. 8. 16. of God testifieth together with our spirits, that we are the sonnes of God. In these words are two testimonies of our adoption set downe. The first is the Spirit of God dwelling in vs, and testifying vnto vs, that we are Gods childrē. But some will happily demaund, How Gods spirit giues witnesse, seeing now there are no reuelations? Answ. Extraordinarie reuelati∣ons are ceased; and yet the holy Ghost in and by the word, reuealeth some things vnto men: for which cause he is called truly the Spirit of Reuelation, Eph. 3. 5. Againe, the holy Ghost giues testimonie, by applying the promise of remission of sinnes, and life euer∣lasting by Christ, particularly to the heart of man, when the same is generally propoun∣ded, in the Ministerie of the word. And be∣cause many are readie presumptuously to say, they are the children of God, when they are not, and that they haue the witnesse of Gods Spirit; when in truth they want it:
therefore we are to put a difference between this carnall conceit, and the true testimonie of the Spirit. Now there be two things whereby they may be discerned one from the other. The first is, by the meanes. For the true testimonie of the holy ghost, is wrought ordinarily by the preaching, reading, and meditation of the word of God; as also by praier, and the right vse of the Sacraments. But the presumptuous testimonie, ariseth in the heart, and is framed in the braine, out of the vse of these meanes; or though in the vse, yet with want of the blessing of God con∣curring with the meanes. The second is, by the effects, and fruits of the Spirit. For it stirrs vp the heart, to praier and inuocation of the name of God, Zach. 12. 10. yea it causeth a man to crie and call earnestly vnto God, in the time of distresse, with a sense and feeling of his owne miseries; and with deepe sighes and groanes, which cannot be vttered, to crae mercie and grace at his hands, as of a louing father, Rom. 8. 26. Thus did Moses crie vnto heauen in his heart, when he was in distresse at the red sea, Exod. 14. 15. And this gift of praier, is an vnfallible testimonie of Gods Spirit; which cannot stand with car∣nall presumption. The second Testimonie of our Adoption, is our Spirit, that is, our conscience sanctified and renewed by the Holy Ghost. And this also is knowne and discerned; first, by the
greefe of the heart for offending God, cal∣led Godly sorrow, 1. Cor. 7. 10. secondly, by a resolute purpose of the heart, and endeauour of the whole man, in all things to obey God: thirdly, by sauouring the things of the Spi∣rit, Rom. 8. 5. that is, by doing the workes of the Spirit, with ioy and chearefulnesse of heart, as in the presence of God, and as his children and seruants. Now put the case, that the testimonie of the Spirit be wanting: then I answer? that the other testimonie; the sanctification of the heart, will suffice to assure vs. We knowe it sufficiently to be true, and not painted fire, if there be heate, though there be no flame. Put the case againe, that the testimonie of the spirit be wanting, and our sanctification be vncertaine vnto vs, how then may we be assured? The answer is, that we must thē haue recourse to the first beginnings, and motions of sanctificatiō, which are these. First, to feele our inward corruptions. Secondly, to be dis∣pleased with our selues for them. Thirdly, to beginne to hate sinne. Fourthly, to grieue so oft as we fal and offend God. Fiftly, to auoid the occasions of sinne. Sixtly, to endeauour to doe our dutie, and to vse good meanes. Seuenthly, to desire to sinne no more. And lastly, to pray to God for his grace. Where these and the like motions are, there is the spirit of God, whence they proceed: and
sanctification is begun. One apple is suffici∣ent to manifest the life of the tree, and one good and constant motion of grace, is suffici∣ent to manifest sanctification. Againe, it may be demanded, what must be done, if both be wanting? Answ. Men must not dispaire, but vse good meanes, and in time they shall be assured. Sect. 2. The Second place is, the 15. Psalme. In the Psal. 15. first verse whereof, this question is propoun∣ded, namely, Who of all the members of the Church, shall haue his habitation in heauen? The answer is made in the verses following: and in the second verse, he sets downe three generall notes of the said person. One is, to walke vprightly in sincerity, approuing his heart and life to God: the second is, to deale iustly in al his doings: the third is, for speech, to speake the truth from the heart, without guile or flatterie. And because we are easily deceiued in generall sinnes, in the 3, 4, and 5. verses, there are set downe seauen more eui∣dent and sensible notes of sinceritie, iustice and trueth. One is in speech, not to take vp or carrie abroad false reports and slanders. The second is, in our dealings not to doe wrong to our neighbour, more then to our selues. The third is in our companie, to con∣temne wicked persons worthy to be con∣temned. The fourth is in our estimation we
haue of others, & that is, to honour them that feare God. The fift is in our words, to sweare and not to change: that is, to make consci∣ence of our word and promise, especially if if it be confirmed by oath. The sixt is in ta∣king of gaine, not to giue money to vsurie; that is, not to take increase for bare lending, but to lend freely to the poore. The last is, to giue testimonie without briberie or partiali∣tie. In the fift verse, is added a reason of the answer: he that in his indeauour doth al these things, shall neuer be mooued, that is, cut off from the Church as an hypocrite. Sect. 3. The third place of Scripture is the first E∣pistle S. Iohns 1. E∣pistle. of Iohn: the principall scope wherof, is to giue a full resolution to the conscience of man, touching the certainty of his saluation. And the principall grounds of assurance, which are there laid downe, may be reduced to three heads. The first is this. He that hath communion or 1. Ioh. 5 . fellowship with God in Christ, may be vndoubted∣ly assured of his saluation. This conclusion is propounded, Chap. 1. v. 3, 4. Where the Apo∣stle tels the Church, that the end of the prea∣ching of the Gospell vnto them was, that they might haue fellowship, not onely mutu∣ally among themselues, but also with God the father, and with his sonne Iesus Christ. And further, that hauing both knowledge, &
assurance of this heauenly communion, to be begun in this life, and perfected in the life to come, their ioy might be full: that is, they might thence reape, matter of true ioy and sound comfort, vnto their soules and consci∣ences. Now whereas it might be haply de∣maūded by some beleeuers, how they should come to this assurance? S. Iohn answeres in this Epistle, that the certainty therof may be gathered by foure infallible notes. The first is Remission of sinnes. For though God be in himselfe, most holy and pure, and no mortall man, being vncleane and polluted by sinne, can haue fellowship with him: yet God hath shewed his mercy, to those that beleeue in him, and hath accepted of the blood of Iesus Christ his sonne, whereby they are clensed from all their corruptions. v. 7. If here it be asked, how this pardon and forgiuenes may be knowne? It is answered, by two signes. One is Hūble and heartie Confession of our sins vnto god; for so saith the Apostle, If we confesse our sins, he is faithfull and iust to forgiue vs our sins, and to clense vs from all iniquitie. v. 9. The other is the pacified Conscience; for being iustified by faith we haue peace with God: and If our heart Rom. 5. 1. condemne vs not: that is if our conscience in respect of sinne doth not accuse vs, then haue we boldnesse towards God, Chap. 3. v. 21. The se∣cond note of fellowship with God, is the sanctifying Spirit, wherby we are renewed in holines & righteousnes: Hereby we know that
he abideth in vs, euen by the Spirit which he hath giuen vs, Chap. 3. v. 24. The third is, holinesse and vprightnes of heart and life. To this end the Apostle saith, If we say that we haue fel∣lowship with him, and walke in darkenes, we lie and doe not truly: but if we walke in the light, as he is in the light, we haue fellowship one with an other, &c. Chap. 1. 6, 7. The fourth is, perseue∣rance in the knowledge and obedience of the Gospel. So the same Apostle exhorteth the Church: Let therefore abide in you that same doctrine concerning Christ, which ye haue heard from the beginning. If that which ye haue heard from the beginning, remaine in you, that is, if ye beleeue and obey it; you also shall continue in the same, and in the father. Chap. 2. 24. The second Ground, He that is the adopted sonne of God, shall vndoubtedly be saued. This point the Apostle plainly declareth, when he saith: Be loued, now are we the sonnes of God. Chap. 3. . 2. — And we knowe, that is, we are vndoub∣tedly assured by faith, that when Christ shall appeare in glory, we shal be like vnto him, for wee shall see him as he is. That the latter part of these words, is thus to be expounded, I ga∣ther out of Chap. 2. 28. as also by compa∣ring this text with that of S. Paul, where he saith, When Christ which is our life shall Col. 3. 26. appeare, then shall we also appeare with him in glorie. And againe, If we be sonnes, we Rom. 8. 7. are also heires, euen the heires of God, and
heires annexed with Christ, if so be that we suf∣fer with him, that we may also be glorified with him. Nowe put the case, that the conscience of the beleeuer, will not rest in this, but de∣sires to be further resolued, touching the certaintie of his adoption? Then I answer, that he must haue recourse vnto the signes, wher∣by a sonne of God may be discerned from a child of the deuill: and these are principally three, First is, truly to beleeue in the name of the sonne of God: for those that haue God for their father, are made the sonnes of God, by faith in Iesus Christ. And this faith snewes Gal. 3. 6. it selfe by obedience. For hereby we are sure that we knowe Christ, that is, that we beleeue in him, and apply him with all his benefits vnto our soules, If we keepe his commandemēts. Nay further, He that saies, I know him, and keepes not his commandements, is a liar, and the trueth is not in him, chap. 2, 3, 4. The second signe is, a heartie desire, and earnest in deauour to be cleansed of his corruptions. Euery sonne of God that hath this hope, purifieth himselfe, e∣uen as Christ is pure, chap. 3. vers. 3. The third is, the loue of a Christian, because he is a Christi∣an: for hereby saies the Apostle, are the chil∣dren of God knowne from the children of the deuill: because the sonnes of Satan doe hate their brethren, (as Cain did his brother Abel) euen for the good workes which they doe. On the other side, Gods adopted sonnes, may hereby know themselues to be
translated from death to life, because they loue the brethren, Chap. 3. 10, 11, 12, &c. The third Ground. They that are assured, of the loue of God to them in particular, may also be certainly assured of their owne saluation. This doctrine follows necessarily vpon the Apo∣stles words, chap. 4. v. 9. For those whome God hath loued from all eternitie, to them he hath manifested his loue, by sending his onely begotten Sonne into the world, that they might liue through him eternally. But how may a man be assured of Gods speciall loue and fauour? The same Apostle answers, by two notes; The first is the loue of our brethren, and that according to Gods commandement, wherein it is commanded; that he that loues God, should loue his brother also, 4. 21. And if any man say, I loue God, and hate his brother, he is a liar. For how can he that loueth not his brother, whome he hath seene, loue God whome he hath not seene? 4. 20. Now that a man deceiue not himselfe in the loue of his brother, Saint Iohn giues three rules; One, that Christian brotherly loue, should not be, for outward respects or considerati∣ons, but principally; because they are the sonnes of God, and members of Christ: Euery one that loueth him which did beget: that is God the fa∣ther, loueth him also which is begotten of him. 5. 1. Another is, that it must not be outward, in shew onely, but inward in the heart. Let vs not loue in word or in tongue onely, but in
deede and in truth. 3. 18. Lastly, that it be not onely in time of prosperitie, but when hee stands in most neede of our loue. For whosoe∣uer hath this worlds good, and seeth his brother haue neede, and shutteth vp the bowels of cōpassiō from him, how dwelleth the loue of God in him? 3. 17. The second note of Gods loue vnto vs is, our loue of God. For those whom God loueth in Christ, to them he giues his grace, to loue him againe. And this louing of him againe, is an euident token of that loue, wherewith he loueth them. So saith the Apo∣stle, We loue him beause he loued vs first, 4. 19. If it be demaunded, howe a man may be as∣sured that he loueth God? the answer is, hee may knowe it by two things; First, by his conformitie to him in holines. The child that loues his father, will be willing to tread in the steps of his father, and so in like manner, he that loueth God, will indeauour euen as hee is, so to be in this world. 4. 17. But howe is that? not in equalitie and perfection, but in si∣militude and conformitie, striuing to be ho∣ly, as he is holy, and indeauouring to doe his will in all things. Secondly, by the weaning of his affection from the things of this world, yea from all pleasures and delights of this present life, so farre forth, as they are seuered from the feare, and loue of God, Loue not this world, nor the things that are in the world: if any man loue this world, the loue of the father is not in him. 2. 15.
Sect. 4. The Fourth place, is in the second of 2. Tim. 2. 19. Timothie, 2. 19. The foundation of God remain∣eth sure, and hath this seale, The Lord knoweth who are his, and let euery one that calleth vpon the name of the Lord, depart from iniquitie. In these wordes, Paul goeth about to cut off an offence, which the Church might take, by reason of the fall of Hymenaeus and Philetus, who seemed to be pillars, and principall men in the Church. And to confirme them against this offence, he saith; The foundation of God, that is, the decree of Gods election, stands firme and sure: so as those which are elected of God, shall neuer fall away, as these two haue done. And this he declares by a double similitude; First of all he saith, the election of God, is like the foundation of an house, which standeth fast, though all the building be shaken. Secondly he saith, that election hath the seale of God, and therefore may not be chan∣ged; because things which are sealed, are thereby made sure and authenticall. Nowe this seale hath two parts: the first concerns God, in that euery mans sal∣uation is written in the booke of life, and God knoweth who are his. And because it might be said, God indeede
knowes who shall be saued, but what is that to vs? we know not so much of our selues. Therefore Saint Paul to answer this, sets downe a second part of this seale, which concerns man, and is imprinted in his heart and conscience; which also hath two bran∣ches: the gift of invocation, and a watchfull care, to make conscience of al and euery sin, in these words, And let euery one that calleth vpon the name of the Lord, depart from iniquitie. Wherby he signifieth, that those that can cal vpon God, & giue him thanks for his bene∣fits, and withall, in their liues make consci∣ence of sinne, haue the seale of Gods electi∣on imprinted in their hearts, and may assure themseles they are the Lords. Sect. 5. A Fift place of scripture, touching this 2. Pet. 1. 10. question is, 2. Pet. 1. 10. Giue all diligence to make your election sure, for if you doe these things you shall neuer fall. Which words containe two parts: First, an exhortation, to make our election sure, not with God, for with him both it, and all other things are vnchangea∣ble; but to ourselues, in our owne hearts & consciences. Secondly, the Meanes whereby to come to this assurance, that is, by doe∣ing the things before named, in the 5. 6, and 7. verses; and that is nothing else, but to practise the vertues of the morall Lawe,
there set downe, which I will briefly shewe what they are, as they lie in the text. To faith, adde vertue] by faith, he meaneth true religion, and that gift of God, whereby we put our trust and confidence in Christ. By vertue, he meaneth no speciall vertue, but (as I take it) an honest and vpright life before men, shining in the vertues and workes of the morall Law. By knowledge, he meanes a gift of God, wherby a man may iudge, how to carrie himselfe warily, and vprightly be∣fore men. By temperance, is vnderstood a gift of God, whereby we keepe a moderation of our naturall appetite, especially about meat, drinke, & attire. By Patience, is ment a vertue, whereby we moderate our sorrowe, in indu∣ring affliction. Godlines, is an other vertue, whereby we worship God, in the duties of the first table. Brotherly kindnesse, is also that vertue, whereby we imbrace the Church of God, & the members thereof with the bowels of loue. And in the last place, Loue, is that vertue, whereby we are well affected to all men, euen to our enemies. Now hauing made a rehersal of these vertues: in the tenth verse he saith, If ye doe these things ye shall ne∣uer fall, that is to say, If ye exercise your selues in these things, you may hereby be well assured and perswaded, of your election and saluation.
CHAP. VII. Of the third maine Question, touching di∣stresse of minde; and generally of all distresses, and their re∣medies. III. Question. How a man beeing in di∣stresse of minde, may be com∣forted and releeued? Ans. Omitting all circumstances (consi∣dering that much might be spoken touching this Question) I will onely set downe that which I take to be most materiall to the doubt in hand. Sect. 1. DIstresse of minde (which Salomon calls a Distresse of minde in ge∣nerall. Prov. 18. 14. broken or troubled spirit) is, when a man is disquieted and distempered in conscience, and consequently in his affections, touching his estate before God. This distresse hath two degrees; the lesse, and the greater. The lesse is a single Feare, or griefe, when a man standeth in suspence and doubt, of his owne
saluation, and in feare that he shall be con∣demned. The greater distresse is Despaire, when a man is without all hope of saluati∣on, in his owne sense and apprehension. I call Despaire a greater distresse, because it is not a distinct kind of trouble of minde, (as some doe thinke,) but the highest degree, in euery kind of distresse. For euery distresse in the minde, is a feare of condemnation, and comes at length to desperation, if it be not cured. All distresse of minde, ariseth from temp∣tation, In speciall. either begunne or continued. For these two doe so necessarily follow, and so inseparably accompanie each the other, that no distresse, of what kinde soeuer, can be se∣uered from temptation. And therefore ac∣cording to the diuers sorts of temptations, that doe befall men, must the distresses of the minde be distinguished. Now Temptations be of two sorts; either of triall, or seducement. Temptations of triall, are such as doe befall men, for the triall and proofe of the grace of God which is in them. The Temptations of triall, are two∣fold: the first, is a combate of the conscience directly and immediately with the wrath of God; which beeing the most grieuous temptation that can be, it causeth the greatest & deepest distresse of conscience. The second is, the Triall of the Crosse, that is, of outward affli∣ction, whereby God maketh proofe of the
faith of his children; and not onely that, but of their hope, patience, and affiance in his mercie for their deliuerance. Temptations of seducement be such, as wherin men are entised, to fall from God and Christ, to any kinde of euill. And these are of three kinds. The first is, immediatly from the Deuill; and it is called the temptation of Blasphemies, or the Blasphemous temptation. The second is, from a mans owne sinnes, origi∣nall and actuall; and this also hath sundrie branches, as we shal see afterward. The third proceedes from Imagination corrupted and depraued. Now answerable to these seuerall kinds of Temptations, are the seuerall kinds of Distresses. And as all temptations may be reduced to those fiue, which haue beene be∣fore named; so may all distresses be reduced to fiue heads, arising of the former tempta∣tions. Sect. 2. Before I come to handle them in particu∣lar; The Generall Remedie of all Distresses. we are to consider in the first place, what is the best and most sure Generall Remedie, which may serue for all these, or any other kind of temptation, that is incident to man: and by this, the curing of any particular di∣stresse, will be more easie and plaine. This generall Remedie, is the Applying of the promise of life euerlasting, in and by the blood of Christ. For no physicke, no arte or
skill of man, can cure a wounded and distres∣sed conscience, but only the blood of Christ. And that this is the soueraigne remedie of all other, no man doubteth. The maine diffi∣cultie is, touching the manner of procee∣ding, in the application of the promise. Here∣in therefore, three things must be perfor∣med. First of all, the partie must disclose the cause of the particular distresse, that the re∣medie may the better be applied. For the truth is, that the very opening of the cause, is a great ease to the minde, before any re∣medie be applied. Yet by the way, this care must be had, that the thing to be reuealed, be not hurtfull to the partie, to whome it is made knowne. For the distresse may happily arise of some confederacie, in matters of Treason; by the concealing whereof, the partie to whome they are reuealed, may in∣tangle himselfe in the same danger. Secondly, if the cause may be knowne, (for sometime it is hid from the partie di∣stressed) then triall must be made, whether the said partie, be fit for comfort yea or no? For if he be found to be vnfit, the word of God shall be misapplied, and consequently abu∣sed. His fitnesse for comfort, may be found out, by searching whether he be humbled for his sinnes, or not: for men may be in great distresse, and yet not touched at all for their sinnes. This humiliation stands in sorrow for
sinne, with confession of the same vnto God, and in earnest praier for the pardon thereof, with an heartie desire of amendment of life. But if on the otherside, the partie be vnhum∣bled, then the first and principall care must be, to worke in him some beginning of hu∣miliation. This may be done in a friendly, and Christian talke and conference, where∣by he must first be brought to see, and well to consider his owne sinnes: secondly, to grieue, and to be sorrie for them, at the least, for some of the principall. And touching this Sorrow, two things must be remembred: first, that the nature of worldly sorrow must be altered, by beeing turned, and changed into sorrow according to God. If a man be in some danger of his life, by bleeding at the nose; experience tea∣cheth, the counsell of the Physitian is, to o∣pen a vaine, and let the partie blood in the arme, that the course thereof may be turned an other way: The like order is to be taken with men, that are troubled with worldly sorrow in their distresse: and that is, to turne the course of their griefe, by causing them to grieue not for worldly respects, or onely in consideration of the punishment, due vnto them for their sinnes, but principally for the very offence of God, in, and by their sinnes committed. This done, a second care must be had, that this sorrow for sinne be not confused, but a
distinct sorrow. The man that is in sorrow, must not be grieued onely, because he is as other men are, a sinner; but more specially for this, and that particular sinne, by which it comes to passe, that he is such, or such a sin∣ner; that so his sorrow in respect of sinne, may be distinct, and brought as it were to some particular head. And men in this case, must deale with the partie distressed, as Sur∣geons are woont to doe with a tumour, or swelling in the bodie, whose manner is, first to applie drawing and ripening plaisters to the place affected, to bring the sore to an head, that the corruption may issue out at some one place: and then afterward healing plaisters which are of great vse to cure the same: Euen so confused griefe, must be redu∣ced to some particulars: and then, and not before, is a man fit for comfort, when his conscience is touched in speciall, in regard of some one or more distinct and seuerall of∣fences. And he that is grieued for one sinne truly, and vnfainedly, from his heart; shall proportionally be grieued for all the sinnes, that he knoweth to be in himselfe. The third thing required in applying this remedie is, the ministring and conuaying of comfort to the minde of him, that hath confessed his sinnes, and is truly humbled for thē: and it is a point of the greatest mo∣ment of all. Where if the question be, how this comfort should be ministred? the answer
is, it may be done, by bringing the partie troubled, within the compasse of the pro∣mise of life. And there be two waies of do∣ing this: the one false, and the other true. Sect. 3. Some thinke, that men may be brought The false way of ministring comfort. within the Couenant, by the doctrine of V∣niuersall grace and redemption. But this way of perswading a mā that he hath title in the Couenant of grace, is both false, and vn∣fit. False it is, because all the promises of the Gospel, are limited with the condition of Faith, and Repentance, not beeing vniuersall to all, but made onely to such persons, as re∣pent and beleeue: therefore they are indefi∣nite in regard of whole mankind, and to be∣leeuers onely they are vniuersall. It is obiected, that God would haue all men to be saued. Ans. The Apostle is the best expounder of himselfe, and he saith in the . Tim. 2. 4. Acts to the same effect, The time of this igno∣rance God regarded not, but NOW he admonish∣eth all men euery where to repent. In which Act. 17. 30. words, Paul addes this circumstance of time [now] to limit this good will of God, to the last age of the world, after the comming of Christ in the flesh, and not to inlarge the same to all the posteritie of Adam. And so must he be vnderstood in the place to Timo∣thie, God would haue all men to be saued, that is, now in this last age of the world. And thus
the same Apostle, 2. Cor. 6. expoundes a cer∣taine prophecie of Isay, concerning the ac∣ceptable time of grace. Now, saith he, is the acceptable time: behold, [Now] is the day of sal∣uation, Esa. 49. 8. meanig the time of the new Testa∣ment. And Coloss. 1. 26. The mysterie hid from the beginning, is now made manifest to the Saints. And, Rom. 16. 26. The revelation of the secret mysterie is now opened. All which, and many other places about the same matter, hauing this circumstance of time [Now,] must needes be limited to this last age of the world. As for the note of vniuersalitie, All, it must not be vnderstood of all particulars, but of all kinds, sorts, conditions, and states of men, as may be gathered out of the for∣mer words: I would that praiers be made for all men, not for euery particular man: (for there be some that sinne vnto death, for whome 1. Ioh. 5. 16. we may not pray,) but for all states of men, as well Princes as subiects, poore as rich, base as noble, vnlearned as learned, &c. But the saying of Paul is vrged, 2. Cor. 5. 18. God was in Christ, reconciling the World vnto himselfe: therfore the promise in Christ, belongs to the whole World, and conse∣quently to euery one. Ans. The saine Apo∣stle shall againe answer for himselfe, Rom. 11. 15. The casting away of the Iewes, is there∣conciling of the world, that is, of the Gentiles in the last age of the world: for so he said be∣fore more plainely, The falling away of the
Iew, is the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them, the riches of the Gentiles. And so must that place to the Corinthes be vnderstood, namely, not of all and euery man, that liued in all ages and times; but of them that were (by the dispensation of the Gospell) to be called out of all kingdomes, and nations, af∣ter the death and ascension of Christ. Thus then the promise of saluation, is not vniuersall, without exception, or restraint: & therfore application made by the vniuersa∣litie of the promise, admits some falshood. Secondly, this way of applying, is also Vnfit. For the reason must be framed thus: Christ died for all men: but thou art a man: ther∣fore Christ died for thee. The partie distressed will grant all, and say, Christ indeede died for him, if he would haue receiued Christ, but he by his sinnes hath cut himselfe off from his owne Sauiour, and hath forsaken him, so as the benefit of his death will doe him no good. Sect. 4. The right way of ministring Comfort to a party distressed followeth. In the handling The Grounds of Comfort. whereof, first, I will lay down the Grounds, wherby any man that belongs to God, may be brought within the Couenant. And then, I will shew the Right Way, how they must be vsed, and applied. For the first Recourse must not be bad to
all graces, or to all degrees and measures of grace; but onely such, as a troubled Con∣science may feele and reach vnto. For those that be the true children of God, and haue excellent measure of grace; when they are in distresse, feele little or no grace at all in themselues. The graces then, that serue for this purpose, are three: Faith, Repen∣tance, and the true Loue of God, which is the fruit of them both. And that we may the more easily and truly discerne of them, and not be deceiued, inquirie must be made, what be the Seedes and beginnings of them all. The first Ground of grace is this: A desire to repent, and beleeue, in a touched heart and con∣science, is faith and repentance it selfe, though not in nature, yet in Gods acceptation. I prooue it thus. It is a principle graunted and confessed of all men; that in them which haue grace, God accepteth the will for the deede. If there bee a willing minde (saith the Apostle) it is accepted not according to that a man hath 2. Cor. 8. 11. not, but according to that he hath. Againe, God hath annexed a promise of blessednes, and life euerlasting to the true and vnfained de∣sire of grace. Whence it is, that they are in Scripture pronounced blessed, which hunger and thirst after righteousnes. And who are they Math. 5. 6. but such, as feele themselues to want all righteousnes, and doe truly and earnestly de∣sire it in their hearts. For hunger and thirst
argues both a want of something, and a fee∣ling of the wāt. And to this purpose the holy Ghost saith, To him that is a thirst will I giue to drinke of the water of life freely. Now this Reuel. 21. 6. thirstie soule, is that man, which feeles him∣selfe destitute of all grace, and Gods fauour in Christ, and withall doth thirst after the blood of Christ, and desires to be made par∣taker thereof. God is wont mercifully to ac∣cept of the desire of any good thing, when a man is in necessitie, and stands in want ther∣of. The Lord (saies Dauid) heares the desire of Psal. 10. 17. the poore, that is, of them that are in distresse, either of bodie or minde. Yea, he will fulfill the desire of them that feare him. It will be said, that the desire of good Psal. 145. 19. things is naturall: and therfore God will not regard mens desires. I answer, Desires be of two sorts; Some be of such things, as men by the meere light of nature know to be good: for example; the desire of wisdome, of ciuill vertue, of ho∣nour, of happinesse, and such like: and all these nature can desire. Others be aboue na∣ture, as the desire of remission of sinnes, re∣conciliation, and sanctification: and they which seriously desire these, haue a promise of blessednes & life euerlasting. And hence it followes, that desire of mercie, in the want of mercie, is mercie it selfe; and desire of grace, in the want of grace, is grace it selfe. A second Ground is this. A godly sorrow
whereby a man is grieued for his sinnes, because they are sinnes, is the beginning of repentance, & indeed for substance is repentance it selfe. The Apostle Paul reioyced that he had in the worke of his Ministerie, wrought this godly sorrow in the hearts of the Corinthians, cal∣ling 2. Cor. 7. 9. it sorrow that causeth repentance not to be repented of. This sorrow may be discerned in this sort: The heart of him in whome it is, is so affected, that though there were no con∣science, nor deuill to accuse, no hell for con∣demnation; yet it would be grieued in it selfe, because God by sinne is displeased, and offended. If it be alleadged, that euery one cannot reach to this beginning of repentance, thus to sorrow for his sinne; then I adde further; If the partie be grieued for the hardnes of his heart, whereby it comes to passe, that he cannot grieue, he hath vndoubtedly re∣ceiued some portion of godly sorrow. For it is not nature, that makes vs to grieue for hardnes of heart, but grace. The third Ground is, that A setled purpose, and willing minde to forsake all sinne, and to turn vnto God, (though as yet no outward conuersion appeare,) is a good beginning of true conuersion, and repentance. I thought (saith Dauid) I will confesse against my selfe my wickednes vnto the Psal. 32. 5. Lord, and thou forgauest the punishment of my sinne. And to this is added (Selah,) which is not onely a musicall note, but, as some
thinke, a note of obseruation, to mooue vs to marke the things that are set downe, as bee∣ing of speciall weight and moment. And surely this is a matter of great consequence; that vpon the very vnfained purpose of con∣fession of sinne, God should giue a pardon thereof. Take a further proofe of this in the prodigall sonne, whome I take not for one that was neuer called, or turned to God, (though some doe so, and seeme to haue warrant for their opinion) but rather for him that is the Child of God, and afterward fals away. Now this man beeing brought by some outward crosses and afflictions, to see his owne miserie, purposeth with himselfe, to returne to his father againe, and to hum∣ble himselfe, and confesse his iniquitie: and vpō this very purpose, whē he had said, I will goe to my father, and say vnto him, father, I haue Luk. 15. 17. 18. sinned, &c. at his returne a farre off, his father receiues him as his child againe, and after acceptation followes his confession. The like is to be seene in Dauid, who beeing re∣prooued by the Prophet Nathan, for his 2. Sam. 12. 13. sinnes of adulterie and murther, presently made confession of them, and at the ve∣ry same time, receiued by the prophet, sentence of absolution, euen from the Lord himelfe, wherein he could not erre. The fourth Ground. To loue any man be∣cause he is a Christian, and a child of God, is a
sensible and certaine note of a man that is par∣taker of the true loue of God in Christ. Hereby (saith S. Iohn) we knowe that we are translated 1. Iohn. 3. 14. from death to life, because we loue the brethren. Loue here is not a cause but onely a signe of gods loue to vs. And our sauiour Christ saith, He that receiueth a Prophet in the name of a Matt. 10. 41. Prophet, shall receiue a Prophets reward. Nowe that we be not deceiued in these grounds; it must be remembred, that these beginnings of grace (be they neuer so weak) must not be littering and fleeting, but constant and setled, not stopped or staied in the way, but such as daily growe and in∣crease: and then they are indeed accepted of God. And he that can finde these begin∣nings, or any of them truly in himselfe, he may assure himselfe thereby that he is the child of God. Sect. 5. Hauing thus laid downe the Groundes of The true way of bringing a man within the Cove∣nant. comfort: I come now to the Way, by which the party in distresse, may be brought within the compasse of the promise of saluation. This way standes in two things; in making Triall, and in Applying the promise. First then, Triall must be made, whether the person distressed haue in him as yet, a∣ny of the forenamed groūds of grace or not. This triall may be made by him that is the
comforter, in the moouing of certaine Que∣stions to the said person. And first, let him aske whether he beleeue and repent? The distressed partie answers no, he cannot re∣pent nor beleeue. Then he must further aske, whether he desire to beleeue and repent? to this he will answer, he doth desire it with all his heart; in the same sort is he to make triall of the other groundes. When a man is in the fitte of tentation; he will say resolutely, he is sure to be damned. Aske him in this fitte, of his loue to God, he will giue answer, he hath none at all: but aske him further, whether he loue a man because he is a Christian, and a child of God, then will he say he doth in∣deed. Thus after triall made in this manner, some beginnings of faith and repentance will appeare, which at the first lay hid. For God vseth out of the time of prosperitie, by, and in distresse and affliction to work his grace. The second point followeth. After that by triall some of the foresaid beginnings of grace, be found out, then comes the right Applying of the promise of life euerlasting to the partie distressed. And that is done by a kind of reasoning: the first part whereof, is taken from Gods word; the second from the testimonie of the distressed conscience; & the conclusion is the applying of the pro∣mise, on this manner: He that hath an vnfai∣nod desire to repent and beleeue, hath remission of Maior.
sinnes, and life euerlasting: But thou hast an ear∣nest Minor. desire to repent and beleeue in Christ. There∣fore Conclusio. remission of sins and life euerlasting is thine. And here remember, that it is most con∣uenient, this Application be made by the Minister of the Gospell, who in it, must vse his ministeriall authority giuen him of God, to pronounce the pardon. For in distresse, it is as hard a thing, to make the conscience yeild to the promise, as to make fire and wa∣ter agree. For though men haue signes of grace and mercie in them, yet will they not acknowledge it, by reason of the extremitie of their distresse. In this manner, vpon any of the former grounds, may the troubled and perplexed soule be assured, that mercie be∣longs to it. And this I take to be, the onely generall and right way, of comforting a di∣stressed conscience. Nowe that the promise thus applyed, may haue good successe, these sixerules must necessarily be obserued. I. One is, that the comfort which is mini∣stred, be alaied with some mixture of the Law; that is to say; the promise alone must not be applyed, but withall mention is to be made, of the sinnes of the partie, and of the grie∣uous punishmēts, due vnto him for the same. The reason is because there is much guile in the hart of man; in so much, as oftentimes it falleth out, that men not throughly hum∣bled, beeing comforted either too soone, or
too much, doe afterward become the worst of all. In this respect, not vnlike to the yron, which beeing cast into the fire vehemently hot, and cooled againe, is much more hard, then it would haue bin, if the heate had bin moderate. And hence it is, that in the mini∣string of comfort, we must somewhat keepe them downe, and bring them on by litle and litle to repentance. The sweetenesse of com∣fort is the greater, if it be delaied with some artnesse of the Law. II. An other rule is this: If the distressed partie, be much possessed with griefe, of himselfe, he must not be left alone, but alwaies attended with good companie. For it is an vsuall practise of the Deuill, to take the vantage of the place and time, when a man is solitarie and depri∣ued of that helpe, which otherwise he might haue in societie with others. Thus he temp∣ted Eue, when shee was apart from her hus∣band. And in this regard, Salomon pronoun∣ces a woe to him that is alone. But herein doth Eccles. . 10. his malice most appeare, in that he is alway readiest, when a man is in great distresse, and withall solitarie, then vpon the sudden to tempt him to despaire, and to the making a∣way of himselfe. III. Thirdly, the partie in distresse must be taught, not to rest vpon his owne iudgement, but alwaies to submit himselfe, and be content to be aduised by others that are men of wisdome, iudge∣ment, and discretion. A thing to be obserued
the rather, because the very neglect thereof, hath caused sundrie persons, to remaine vn∣comforted for many yeares. IV. Fourthly, the partie distressed, must ne∣uer heare tell of any fearefull accidents, or of any that haue bin in like, or worse case then himselfe is. For vpon the very report, the distressed conscience will fasten the accident vpon it selfe, and thereby commonly will be drawne to deeper griefe or despaire. The mind affli∣cted is prone to imagine searefull things, and sometime, the very bare naming of the De∣uill, will strike terrour and feare into it. V. Fiftly, the partie that is to comfort, must beare with all the wants of the distres∣sed; as with their frowardnes, peeuishnes, rashnes, and with their distempered and dis∣ordered affections and actions: yea he must put vpon him (as it were) their persons, bee∣ing affected with their miserie, and touched with compassion of their sorrowes, as if they were his owne, grieuing when he seeth them to grieue, weeping when they doe weepe and lament. VI. Sixtly, he that is the comforter, must not be discouraged, though after long la∣bour and paines taking, there follow small comfort and ease, to the partie distressed. For men wil often bewray their stiffenes in temptation, and vsually it is long be∣fore comfort can be receiued; and why? surely because God hath the greatest stroke
in these distresses of minde, and brings men thorough all the temptations, that he hath appointed, euen to the last and vtmost, be∣fore he opens the heart to receiue comfort. The Church in the Canticles seekes for her beloued; but before shee can finde him, shee goes about in the citie, through the streetes, and by open places, passing by the Watch∣men themselues, and after shee hath vsed all meanes without helpe or hope, at length, and not before, shee findes her beloued, him in whom' her soule delighteth. Cant. 3. 4. Thus much for the generall Remedie of all Distresses: now I come to the particular Distresses themselues. CHAP. VIII. Of the first Speciall Distresse, arising of a divine temptation. THE first distresse ariseth of a divine Temptation, which is a combate with God himselfe immediatly. And this distresse is, when the conscience speakes some feareful things of God, and withall the partie distressed, feeles some euident tokens of Gods wrath.
Sect. 1. Examples hereof we shall finde many in Examples. the word of God. One is, the example of righteous Iob, who hauing beene long in outward afflictions, was withall exercised with the apprehension of the anger of God, and in that state he saith, that the arrowes of Iob. 6. 4. the Almightie were in him, that the venime thereof, did drinke vp his spirit, that the terrours of God did fight against him. Yea further he addeth, that God was his enemie, and writ bit∣ter things against him: and made him to possesse Iob. 13. 26. the sinnes of his youth. And at an other time he complaineth, that Gods wrath had torne him, that he hated him, gnashed vpon him with his Iob. 16. 9. teeth, and had sharpened his eyes against him: yea that he had taken him by the necke and beaten him, and set him as a marke for himselfe. In all which, and diuers other places, it appeares that his conscience was exercised, with the sense of the wrath of God, which had now euen seazed vpon his soule. Another example we haue in Dauid, who also was exercised with this temptation and trouble of minde, as the first words of the 6. Psalme, and the whole tenour thereof doe e∣uidently Psal. 6. shew: For first, he desires the Lord, not to rebuke him in his wrath, and afterward complaineth, that his griefe was so great, that his very flesh consumed, his bones were vexed, and his bodie brought to such a state,
as no sicknesse could haue brought him vn∣to. And it is not vnlike, that the same Pro∣phet did often fall into the like kind of di∣stresse of minde, as may be gathered out of Psalme 77. and sundrie other places. Now as it fared with these, and diuers o∣ther seruants of God, in ancient times, so are we not without some instances thereof in our daies. Amongst many, that worthie man Master Luther, writes of himselfe, that he was in this particular temptation, and that he learned in it, the doctrine of the Iustifica∣tion of a sinner, by the meere mercie of God, without any merit of workes: and vp∣on the sense and experience of the nature and properties of this distresse, he wrote a notable exposition of the 6. Psalme of Da∣uid, the scope and intent whereof, he writeth to be nothing els, but a soueraigne remedie of this and the like distresses of the minde and conscience. Sect. 2. If it be demaunded, what is the Occasion The Occasion. of this kind of temptation? I answer, that it ariseth sometimes, vpon the commission of some notorious sinne, which doth wound the conscience, as in Cain, Iudas, and Saul, who for their great and capitall sinnes, that stinged and wounded their consciences, grew to a fearefull state, and consequently perished in this temptation. Sometimes a∣gaine
it comes when there is no sinne com∣mitted, but obedience to God performed: and then there cannot be rendered any rea∣son of it, either in man, or out of man, saue this, that God will haue it so to be. And the truth hereof is plaine by the examples of Iob and Dauid before mentioned. Sect. 3. The Effects of this Temptation are many, The Effects of the Tempta∣tion. and very strange. For outwardly it workes a change and alteration in the body, as it were a burning ague, and it causeth the entralls to rise, the liuer to rowle in the bodie, and it sets a great heat in the bones, and consumes the flesh, more then any sicknes can doe. And that it is so, as I say, beside experience, it is cleare in the word of God. Dauid in this di∣stresse affirmeth, that his eyes were eaten as it were with wormes, and sunke into his head, Psal. 6. 7. that his moisture became as the drought in sommer. Psal. 32. 4. and Iob saies, that his skin was blacke vpon him, his bones were burnt with Iob. 30. 30. heat: yea that by meanes of this distresse he was now full of wrinkles, and his leanenes did rise Iob 16. 8. vpon him. It is a principle which Physitians doe hold, that The minde followes the tempera∣ture of the bodie, and is affected according to the good or euill constitution thereof: which though it be true, yet withall it is as manifest on the other side, that the bodie doth often follow
the state and condition of the minde. For a distressed heart, must of necessitie, make a fainting and a languishing bodie. Sect. 4. But the principall thing to be sought for The Remedie. in this temptation is the Remediē thereof: whereunto there be fiue things required, which are to be practised, as occasion shall be offered. First, choise must be made of the most fitte and present remedie, and that must be vsed in the first place. Now the most fit and present remedie is, to bring the partie troubled to the personall exercises of faith and repentance, by, and in himselfe. For this ende, he must examine his conscience most straightly and narrowly of all the sinnes of his heart, and life. Secondly, he must humbly confesse against himselfe, all his knowne sinnes: and withall acknowledge the due condemnation, that he thereby hath deserued. Thirdly, he must crie to heauen for mercie, intreating the Lord most instantly for pardon, and for the restraint of his wrath due vnto him for his sinne. Dauid beeing in this distresse, performed all these duties, as we may read in the 6. Psalme: and he saith further of himselfe, that whilst he concealed his sinnes, the hand of God was heauie vpon him: but Psal. 3. vpon his earnest confession, and deprecation, he receiued mercie. And if we read the booke of
Iob, we shall finde that the principall scope thereof is this; namely, to shew vnto vs, that Iob was throughly exercised with this temp∣tation, and that in the ende hauing beene re∣buked both by his friends, and by God him∣selfe, his recouerie was made, by humbling himselfe, when he saith, Behold, I am vile: a∣gaine, now I abhorre my selfe, and repent in dust Iob 39. 37. and ashes. Some may here demand, If it fall out, that the person himselfe, cannot performe any good dutie, of himselfe, by reason of his di∣straction in soule and bodie, what must then be done? Ans. If the partie can but sigh, and sobbe vnto God for mercie, and comfort: it is no doubt, a worke of Gods spirit, and a practise both of faith, and repentance. We know not (saith Saint Paul) what to pray as we Rom. 8. 26. ought, (namely, in our distresses) but the Spirit it selfe maketh request for vs, with sighes that cannot be expressed: and therein lies our com∣fort. Thus Moses at the redde sea beeing in Exod. 14. 15. great distresse, and not knowing what to say, or doe, sighed and groned inwardly in his soule vnto the Lord, for helpe and protecti∣on: and his very desire was in stead of a loud crie in the eares of the Lord. The second thing is, that triall must be made, whether the partie hath in him any tokens of grace, or not? These tokens are the small beginnings of grace, which before I haue declared. As for
example: a griefe because we cannot grieue for sinne as we should: a serious will and de∣sire to beleeue, and repent: a purpose to sin no more, and such like. If these be found in the partie, then by them as by sure pledges, he may bee assured of the fauour of God to∣wards him: and where any of these be found, the saying of God to Saint Paul must be vrged, My grace is sufficient for thee: and therewith must the distressed partie stay his 2. Cor. 12. 9. minde. Yea we are to be content with any condition in this life, be it neuer so misera∣ble, so long as we are in the fauour of God, though he should lay vpon vs euen the paines of hell, till the time of our death. So did Dauid, who when he was pursued by his owne sonne, vttered these words vnto God, Behold, if I please thee not, do with me what thou 2. . 15. 26. wilt And the like was the mind of Paul, who being assured of the fauour of God, was content for his glorie, & the saluation of the Israelits (if it had beene possible) to be sepa∣rated Rom. 9. 3.  Christ, and to indure the very pangs of hell. The third thing in this cure is, to Applie to the said distressed partie, such promises of God made vnto afflicted persons, as are most large and comfortable. For example, that The Lord is neere to them that are of a contrite heart, and will saue such as be afflicted in spirit. Psal. 34. 18. Againe, I came not (saith our Sauiour Christ) but to the
lost sheepe of the house of Israel. Matth. 15. 24. He saies not, to the straying sheepe, but to such as are now in the pitte, readie to be drowned, or in the Lyons mouth, readie to be deuoured. Againe. The Spirit of the Lord is Luk. 4. 18. vpon me, therefore he hath annointed me that I should preach the Gospell to the poore; that is, to such as are distressed in consciēce, and poore in spirit: he hath sent me that I should heale the broken hearted, that I should preach deliuerance to the captiues. These & many other such like promises, are in this case to be vrged, and the partie mooued to endeauour to beleeue them, to hold to them, and rest himselfe vp∣on them, though he loose all things els. Fourthly, the partie must be brought to a serious consideration of his owne life past, and of Gods mercifull dealing with him & others in his case in former times, and ther∣with is he to be comforted for the time pre∣sent. For if aforehand he hath receiued any tokens of the fauour and loue of God; by them he is now to stay and to settle his minde. The reason is plaine: the gifts of god are without repentāce; whom he loueth once he loueth to the ende, & whom he chooseth he calleth, iustifieth, and sanctifieth, and will also in time glorifie. Dauid beeing in such af∣fliction, that he could hardly thinke vpon God, yet he tooke this course, praied to the Lord for comfort, communed with his owne heart, and called to remem∣brance Psal. 7. 7. 10.
how God had formerly dealt with him, and with this meditation of the conti∣nuall course of Gods mercie in his preser∣uation, he confirmed his faith, and staied his heart in his greatest troubles. Sect. 5. The fifth and last thing to be done, is the Remoouall of Doubts. remooueall of such reasons and doubts, as the partie distressed vsually makes against him∣selfe, for his owne ouerthrow. For it is the manner of those that are troubled in minde, to dispute against themselues; and commōly they are woont to alleadge three things. First, beeing instructed how to humble themselues, and to depend on Gods mercie, they will graunt, that all these indeede are good things, but they belong not to them: for they neither do, nor can feele any thing, but the tokens of Gods anger, and that they are alreadie entred, into some degrees of condemnation. This obiection may be taken away, by in∣forming them of the manner of Gods dea∣ling in all his workes. For commonly he workes all things in his creatures, in, and by cōtraries, if we could know the whole frame of them. Thus in the Creation euery creature had his beeing of that which had no beeing, and something was made, not of something, but of nothing. After the flood, the signe of
Gods coueuant, for the preseruation of the world from destruction by raine, is the Rain∣bow, which indeed is a naturall signe of raine. When Elias was to prooue the Lord to be the onely true God, against the Idola∣trous priests of Baal, and that by burnt offe∣rings; he powred water vpon the sacrifice, & fills a trench with water round about, and in this contrarie means was the sacrifice burnt vp. Christ for the curing of a blind man, tē∣pers spittle and clay together, which in all reason, is a fitter meanes to put out the eyes, then to cause the blind to see. Thus in the worke of our Redemption, Christ giues life, not by life, but by death, and he sendes men to heauen by the gates and suburbs of hell: he shewes his greatest power, in the greatest weaknes; nay his pow∣er  Cor. 12. 9. is made perfect through weakenes. He will not build vpon an old foundation, but he pulls downe and destroies all, that Man may haue no hope at all in himselfe, but that all the hope he hath, may be in God. First he kils, and then he makes aliue, as Anna 1. Sam. 2. speaketh: first he woundeth, and then he hea∣leth. He makes man to sowe in teares, that afterward he may reape in ioy. And he that knowes Gods dealing to be this, must here∣with rest content, and satisfied: because in wrath, God vseth to remember his mercy; yea his mercie is neuer sweete vnto the pa∣late of the soule, vntill it be seasoned with
some tast of his wrath. The Paschall Lambe was eaten with sowre hearbs, to signifie, that we can feele no sweetenes in the blood of Christ, till wee first feele the smart of our owne sinnes, and corruptions. Secondly, these persons vse to alleadge a∣gainst themselues, that if they could feele a∣ny comfort at al, then they would stay their minds, and yeild to good perswasions, and exhortations. To this, the answer is; That there is a Rule of grace, (which we must follow) gathered out of the word of God, and the experience of Gods Children, contrarie to the rule of nature, and aboue the light of reason: and it is this, that in case of aliction, we must not liue by feeling, but by faith. This Rule is grounded vpon the speech of the Lord by the Prophet, the iust mā shall liue Hab. 2. 4. by his faith. When we haue neither sight, nor sense, nor any tast of Gods mercie, but onely apprehend his wrath, euen then we must la∣bour to lay hold of mercie in his word, and promise. Sense & feeling, are not alwaies fit directiōs for the time of this life: For he may be the deare child of God, that in present feeleth nothing but his wrath and indigna∣tion. This indeede is the true triail of our faith, when euen aboue and against reason, we relie on the mercie of God, in the ap∣prehension of his anger. So did Dauid. Out of the deepe, (saith he) that is, beeing nowe
deepely plunged into the pangs of a distres∣sed conscience, haue I called vpō thee, O Lord: Psal. 130. and Iob in the like case. Lord, though thou kill me, yet will I trust in thee. Abraham is com∣mended by the holy Ghost, amongst other things, for this, that he beleeued in God, a∣boue hope: that is, against all matter of hope, that might possibly be conceiued, vpon the consideration of the strength of natural cau∣ses. The thiefe vpon the crosse, feeling no∣thing but woe: and seeing nothing in Christ but misery and contempt, yet he beleeued in Christ, and was saued. In a word, Christ Rom. 4. 18. himselfe when he was sorsaken of all men, and voide of all wordly comfort, and felt nothing but the depth of the wrath God, in his agony and passion; yet by the faith of his manhood, hestaied himselfe and said, My God, my God. Thirdly they vse to plead, that their case is desperate, that neuer any was in such a state as they are, neuer any touched with the like distresse of mind. Answ. It is false: For the holy Ghost hath penned three notable places of Scripture, the booke of Iob, and two Psalmes of Dauid, Psal. 6. and 77. wherein are propounded vnto vs the ex∣amples of Iob and Dauid, Gods owne deare seruants, who were in as great distresse, as e∣uer they, or any other haue beene. And they may not thinke, that they euer could be able, to indure greater paines then Christ, who
notwithstanding in the anguish of his soule vpon the Crosse, cried out, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? And thus much touching the first kind of trouble of conscience, called the diuine temptation. CHAP. IX. Of the second Speciall Distresse, arisig from outward afflictions. THe second kind of Distresse is that which ariseth from outward afflictions. By Afflicti∣ons I vnderstand, all manner of miseries and calamities in this life, from the least to the grea∣test, from the paine of the little finger, to the very pangs of death. Nowe the Question is, howe the Trouble of minde, arising by Afflictions, may be re∣medied. For the answer of which question, two things are required of the partie distres∣sed, Practise and Meditation. Sect. 1. The Practise is that, which is to be vsed, in Practise in case of Affli∣ction. all distresses of minde what soeuer. And it is a diligent examination of the conscience in
regard of sinne; an earnest and heartie con∣fession thereof vnto God: and deprecation, that is, earnest praier vnto him, for the pardon of the same. These three things, beeing done truly and vnfainedly from the heart, are a present remedie against this trouble, and bring with them much comfort. Manasses the king of Iudah, that had cō∣mitted much wickednesse: when he was car∣ried captiue to Babel, and there put in chaines, he humbled himselfe, acknowledg∣ed 2 Chro. 33. 11. 12, his sinnes, and praied earnestly vnto the Lord, and the issue was good; for God was intreated of him, and gaue him deliuerance. Iob beeing long in outward affliction, hum∣bled himselfe in like manner, and at length receiued comfort, Daniel humbled himselfe before God, for his owne sinnes, and for the sinnes of Gods people, making request vnto Dan. 9. 10. 11. God earnestly for them, and euen when he was in the acte of praying, the Lord sent his angel Gabriel, to giue him notice of de∣liuerance. Lastly, the Church of God, vnder the crosse, performed the like dutie, Let vs Lament 3. 40. search and trie our waies, and turne to the Lord, and God in mercie gaue an eare vnto her mourning and lamentation. By all these pla∣ces, it is apparent, that there is no better remedie in the world, for the minde of man, grieued by meanes of outward afflicti∣ons, then the practise of the duties before named.
Sect. 2. The next thing vnto Practise, is the Medi∣tation of the comfortable doctrines that are Meditations in case of Af∣fliction. set downe in the word of God, touching afflictions. All which doctrines, may be re∣duced to fiue principall and maine grounds of comfort, and shall be laid downe in their order. The first Ground is, that All afflictions from Grounds. I. Gods provi∣dence. the least to the greatest, doe come to passe, not by accident, chaunce, or fortune, but by the speciall prouidence of God. I explaine it thus: In euery particular crosse and affliction, there is the hand of Gods particular prouidence, and that in three regards. First, because God decreeth, and foreappoin∣teth euery particular crosse. Marke the words of Paul, Whome God hath foreknowne, them he Rom. 8. 28. hath predestinate, to be made like vnto the image of his sne; and what is this image? nothing else, but a conformitie vnto Christ in affli∣ctions for this life, and in glorie for the life to come. Now if God hath decreed, that those whome he foreknew, should be con∣formable vnto his Sonne in these respects, then hath he also decreed the afflictions themselues. Secondly, God doth not onely barely per∣mit afflictions to be, but also he effecteth them, and brings them into execution, as they are crosses, corrections, trialls, and pu∣nishments.
I make peace (saith the Lord) and I Esa. 45. 7. create euill, that is, not the euill of sinne, but of punishment, which is euill in our sense and feeling. For things are tearmed euill two waies: some are euill indeed, some are euill not indeed, but in regard of our sense, appre∣hension, and estimation; and of this latter sort are afflictions, which God is said to cre∣ate. And to this purpose is the saying of the Prophet Amos, Shall there be euill in the citie, Amos 3. 6. and the Lord hath not done it? Thirdly, as God causeth afflictions, so he ordereth and disposeth them, that is, he limi∣teth and appointeth the beginning, the end, the measure or quantitie, and the continu∣ance thereof. Yea he also ordereth them to their right endes, namely, his owne glorie, the good of his seruants, and the be∣nefit of his Church. Thus God is saide to correct his people in iudgement, that is, so Ierem 30. 11. as he will haue the whole ordering of the correction in his owne hand. Ioseph tells his brethren, that when they intended e∣uill against him, in selling him to the Ish∣maelites for siluer, God disposed it for good. Gen. 50. 19, 20. When Shemei cursed Dauid, he forbade his seruants, so much as to meddle with him, and why? because (saith he) the Lord 2. Sam. 16. 10. bade him to curse, and who then dare say on∣to him, Why hast thou done so? And to this pur∣pose the Prophet Dauid saith, I held my peace and said nothing: why? because thou, Lord, hast
done it, Psal. 39. 9. Here some wil say, if Afflictions did come onely from God, it were somewhat, but of∣entes they come from men, that beare vs no good will, and therefore no maruell though we be impatient. Answ. When cros∣ses doe come from men, God vseth them as instruments, to execute his iudgements vp∣on vs; and in this worke, God is the chiefe doer, and they are as tooles, in the hand of the workman. And the Lord inflicteth them vpon vs by men, to trie our patience vnder the crosse. Ioseph, though he knew well, the badde dealing of his brethren towards him, yet he looked not to them alone, but to an higher cause, namely, the Lord himselfe, who executed his owne good will by them: God (faith he) disposed it to good, And againe, God did send me before you into Egypt for your Gen. 45. 5. & 50. 20. preseruation. The Second ground is, The commandement II. Gods commā∣dement. of God, touching the crosse, and obedience vnto him therein. This commaundement is expressed, Luk. 9. 23. where we are commanded to take vp our crosse euery day, and follow Christ. A∣braham was commanded, with his owne hands to sacrifice his onely sonne Isaac; and to this commandement, (though otherwise a great crosse vnto him) he addresseth him∣selfe to yeeld obedience. And in the pro∣phecie of Micah, the Church saith, Shee will Mich. 7. 9. boare the wrath of the Lord, that is, shee will
performe obedience to him in the crosse, be∣cause shee had sinned against him. And Saint Peter saith, that God resisteth the proud, and gi∣ueth grace to the humble: therefore humble your 1. Pet. 5. 5, 6. selues vnder the mightie hand of God. And this beeing the commaundement of God, that we should yeeld obedience to him, in euery affliction, we ought to be no lesse carefull to obey it, then any one commandement of the morall Law. The Third ground is, that God will be pre∣sent III. Gods presence. with his seruants in their afflictions. Vpon this ground, Dauid comforts himselfe, be∣cause God had promised to heare him, to be with Psal. 91. 5. him in trouble, and to deliuer him. And in an o∣ther place, Though I should walke in the shad∣dow of death, I would feare none ill, for thou art Psal. 23. 4. with me, &c. Now that we may the better vnderstand this doctrine, we are to consider what be the Ends or Effects of Gods beeing with vs in affliction, whereby he testifieth his presence, and they are three. The first is, to worke our deliuerance from the crosse: Call vpon me (saith the Lord) in the Psal. 50. 15. time of thy trouble, and I will deliuer thee. This promise must not be vnderstood simply, but with an exception, so farre forth as it shall be for our good. For all promises of temporall deliuerance, are conditionall, and must be conceiued, with this limitation of the crosse and chastisement, if God please to impose it.
Some may say, how if God will not deli∣uer vs, but leaue vs in the affliction, what cō∣fort shall we then haue? Answ. In the second place therefore we must remember▪ that God will temper and moderate our afflictions, so as we may be a∣ble to beare them. Habbakuk praieth vnto God, in the behalfe of the Church, that he would in wrath remember mercie. And Paul Hab. 3. 2. saith, that the Lord will not suffer vs to be temp∣ted aboue that we are able to beare, but will giue 1. Cor. 10. 13. an issue with the temptation. Thirdly, put the case that God doth not moderate our afflictions, but suffer them to remaine vpon vs, not onely for some time of our life, but to the very death: yet then will he testifie his holy presence an other way, namely, by giuing the partie distressed, power and strength to beare his affliction. Vnto you it is giuen (saith Paul) for Christ, that not onely ye should beleeue in him, but also suffer Phil. 1. 29. for his sake. The Fourth ground of comfort in afflicti∣on is, that euery affliction vpon the seruants of IV. Goodnes of Afflictions. God, hath some speciall goodnesse in it. Rom. 8. 28. We know that all things, worke together for good vnto them that loue God. And in regard here∣of, the crosses which are indured by Gods children, are so farre from beeing preiudici∣all to their saluation, that they are rather helps and furtherances of the same. Now this Goodnes is perceiued two waies. First,
by the fruit and effect of it, and then by the qualitie and condition thereof. In both which respects, afflictions are good. Touching the fruits of Afflictions, because Fruits of Af∣fliction. they are manifold, I will reduce them to sea∣uen principall heads. I. Afflictions doe make men to see and Consideration. consider their sinnes. Iosephs brethren for twentie yeares together, were little or not at all troubled for their wickednes, in selling their brother; yet vpon their affliction in E∣gypt, they began to consider what they had done. We haue (say they) verily sinned against Gen. 42. 21. our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soule, when he besought vs, and we would not heare him: therefore is this trouble come vpon vs. Manasses in the time of his peace, gaue him∣selfe to witchcraft, and the worshipping of straunge gods: but when he was captiue in Babylon, then was he brought to the sight of his sinnes, & mooued to humble himselfe before God for them. II. Afflictions serue to humble men in Humiliation. their soules before God. The young vnthrift in the Gospel, called the Prodigall childe, while his portion lasted he spent liberally, and was grieued for nothing: but when he Luk. 15. 17, &c. came to be pinched with hunger, and that through his owne follie, then he humbled himselfe before his father, & returned home vnto him. Dauid saith of himselfe, that in his prosperite be thought he should neuer be moo∣ued,
because the Lord of his goodnesse had made his mountaine to stand strong: but (saith he) thou didst hide thy face, and I was troubled, then cried I vnto the Lord. III. They serue to worke Amendment Amendment. of life. No chastising (saith the Author to the Hebrewes) for the present seemeth to be ioyous, but afterward it bringeth the quiet fruit of righ∣teousnesse, Heb. 12. 11. to them that are thereby exercised; that is, afflictions and chastisments that seaze vpon Gods children, doe leaue after them a∣mendment of life, as the needle passeth tho∣rough the cloath, and leaueth the threed be∣hinde it. When we are iudged (saith the Apo∣stle) we are nurtered of the Lord, that we might 1. Cor. 11. 31. not be condemned with the world. And Dauid confesseth, Psal. 119. It is good for me that I haue beene afflicted, that I might learne thy sta∣tutes. And the good husbandman, purgeth and pruneth the vine, that it may bring forth Ioh. 15. more and better fruit. IIII. They cause men to denie them∣selues, and to relie wholly on the mercie of Abnegation. God. Thus Paul receiued the sentence of death . Cor. 1. 9. in himselfe, that he should not trust in himselfe, but in God, that raiseth the dead. V. The fift, is Invocation. For afflictions make vs to crie heartily and feruently vnto Innosation. God, to bring our selues into his presence, and there to abase our selues before him. Thus the Lord said of the olde Israelites, that when he slew them, then they returned, & sought
him earely, Psal. 78. 34. And els where he saith of his children, that in their affliction they will Hos. 5. 15. seeke him diligently. VI. The sixth, is Patience. Affliction brin∣geth Patience. Rom. 5. 3. forth patience, patience experience, &c. As if he should say; because the loue of God is shed in our hearts, therefore in afflictions we are patient. Now whilst we patiently heare the crosse, we haue experience of the mercie and loue of God towards vs: and hauing once in some notable deliuerance, tried and tasted the mercie of God, we doe by hope (as it were) promise to our selues, the saide fa∣uour and mercie, for time to come. VII. The last fruit, is Obedience. This Obedience. the holy Ghost teacheth, to haue beene the fruit of the suffering of Christ, when he saith, Though he were the sonne, yet learned he obedi∣ence, Heb. 5. 8. by the things which he suffered. In the next place, Afflictions are good in regard of their qualitie and condition, which is, that they are tokens and pledges of our adoption, when we make the best vse of them. If ye in∣dure Heb. 12. 7. chastening, (saith the holy Ghost) God of∣fereth himselfe vnto you as vnto sonnes, that is, he comes to you in the crosse, not as a iudge and reuenger, but as a kind and louing fa∣ther; and the crosse imposed, is as it were his fatherly hand, wherewith the chastiseth vs: and therefore Iob praiseth God for his affli∣ction, saying, God hath giuen, and God hath taken away, blessed be the name of the Lord. Iob. 1. 2.
The fifth Ground of comfort is, that the partie distressed, hath partners in the crosse. For V Partakers in the Crosse. first, he hath Christ to be his partner, be∣cause he hath fellowship with him, in that he is afflicted, and is willing to obey God therein. Paul accounteth it happines, to knowe the fellowship of Christs afflicti∣ons, and to be made conformable vnto his death. Phil. 3. 10. And Saint Peter exhorteth beleeuers to reioyce in as much as they are par∣takers of Christes sufferings. 1. Pet. 4. 13. Se∣condly, if the partie afflicted repent, Christ communicateth with him in al his crosses, & accounts them as his owne. The Apostle in this regard, would haue no man thinke it strange, no not when he is in the fierie triall; but rather to reioyce because he is partaker of Christs sufferings. 1. Pet. 4. 12. And Christ saith to Saul persecuting his Church, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? Thirdly, he that is afflicted, hath other seruants of God, par∣takers with him in all his afflictions. The A∣postle Peter wisheth the Church of God to resist Sathan by faith, knowing, saith he that the same afflictions are accomplished, in your bro∣thren that are in the world. 1. Pet. 5. 9. Thus much generally of Afflictions, and of Comfort in them. It were a long and tedi∣ous worke to set all downe in particular, to∣gether with their proper and distinct Com∣forts: therefore I will passe them ouer, and speake only of three kinds of Afflictions,
with their Remedies. Sect. 2. The first is, the Deferring of deliuerance: a Desring of Deliuerance. great afflictiō, if it be considered. And touch∣ing it, I propound one Question, namely, How the minde of the partie distressed, may be staied, when as the Lord deferres deliuerance. For the answer hereof, three especiall points are to be considered. I. First, that God hath in his wisdome, set downe certen and unchangeable times, for the accomplishment and issue of all things that are. Ther is a time appointed to euery thing vnder the sunne, Eccl. 3. 1 The speech of Salomon is generall, and the meaning of it is this. Whatsoeuer there is in the world, either done, or suffered, or enioyed by man, whe∣ther it be of the number of naturall things, or of those which are voluntarily vnderta∣ken, or necessarily endured; God hath in his prouidence sorted vnto them, a set time and season, whereof dependeth the successe of them all. And this time, himselfe most freely ordereth and ruleth at his owne good plea∣sure; which, as no mā can hinder or stay, so is it not in the power of any, to hasten, or preuēt. This point, the Holy Ghost in Scripture prooueth by two instances, of the threat∣nings and promises of God, which him∣selfe accomplisheth, at some certaine and vnchangeable times.
When the old world in the daies of No∣ah, had growne to much impietie, and wic∣kednes, the Lord appointed a certaine space of 120. yeares, for their repentance and con∣uersion; at the very ende and tearme where∣of, Gen. 6. 3. he brought the flood vpon them, and not before. For if we compare the particular cir∣cumstances of time, noted in the 7. of Ge∣nesis, with that which S. Peter writeth, 1. Pet. 3. 20. ee shall find, that the inundation of waters came vpon the earth, at the very point of time before determined. Againe, God threatned by Ieremie, that the Iewes for their sins, should be led cap∣tiue, and serue the king of Babel 70. yeares. Now if we take the iust computation of Ier. 25. 11. time, it will appeare, that so soone as euer those yeres were expired, the foresaid threat was accomplished. And therefore Daniel, al∣luding to Ieremies prophecie, exactly setteth it downe, when he saith, The same night was Belshazzarking of the Chaldeans slaine, that is, Dan. 5. 30. the very night wherein those 70. yeares came to their full period. And as there are set times, allotted by God for the execution of his threatning sentēces; so also hath he determined certen∣ly, the accomplishment of all and euery of his promises. An example hereof we haue in the Israe∣lites, of whom the Lord said to Abrahā, that Gen. 15. 13. they should be in affliction in a strange land,
430. yeres, and then be deliuered. This pro∣mise of God was expressely fulfilled, as we read in the booke of Exodus. For before the ende and tearme of these yeares, they had no deliuerance at all: but when that time was expired, euen that selfe same day, departed Exod. 12. 4 all the hosts of Israel, out of the land of E∣gypt. And though Moses, fourtie yeares be∣fore this time, tooke in hand the worke of their deliuerance; yet he did it without suc∣cesse; Act. 7. 25. and vpon a certaine accident, beeing himselfe constrained to flie into Madian, he liued there as a stranger with Iethro his fa∣ther in law, till the saide time of foure hun∣dred and thirtie yeares was accomplished; toward the ende whereof, being called of God to that office, he prospered, and not be∣fore. And in the same manner, hath God set downe a certaine period of time, within which, he will exercise his children more or lesse, and at the end wherof, and not before, he will releeue and comfort them againe. Now as the certentie of the accomplish∣ment of Gods threatning word, serues to terrifie all wicked liuers from sinne: so the vnchangeable performance of his promises, at the very time prefixed, & not before, tea∣cheth the children of God sundrie things. First, that when they are in any distresse, & haue not present or speedie deliuerance, ac∣cording to their desire, they should waite the Lords leisure, and expect with patience
till the time come, which is appointed by him for their ease and releefe: and in the meane while stay their hearts, by hope and affiance in his mercie. Reason is plaine. God is sure in his word, therefore though heaui∣nes may indure for a night, yet ioy will re∣turne in the morning, Psal. 30. 5. Thus the Lord comforteth the Iewes in a particular distresse, as we may read in the prophecie of Habbakuk, where the Prophet in the name of the Iewes, complaineth and Hb. 2. 2, 3. expostulateth the matter with God, why his owne people should be so lamentably affli∣cted, by a terrible and furious nation, and why they should be led away captiues, by the Chaldeans the enemies of God? To this the Lord makes answer, that as he had certenly determined, that iudgemēt to come vpon them, so certenly had he appointed a set time, wherein they should be deliuered. In the meane while, he bids them to com∣fort themselues in this, that though the affli∣ction should rest vpon them for a season, yet vndoubtedly they should be eased at the length: and therefore, that they should in pa∣tience waite for the vision, that is, the accō∣plishment of the vision touching their deli∣uerance. Secondly, hence we learne, that we must not onely beleeue the promises of God in ge∣nerall, that God is true and faithfull in them, and that he is able & willing to fulfil them,
euen as he made them: but we must beleeue them in particular, that is with application to their proper and seuerall circumstances, which are the particular meanes, places, and times, whereby, and wherein he hath giuen his word, as touching our freedome and exemption from the crosse. Take an instance hereof in the Prophet Daniel, who knew well by the spirit of Pro∣phecie, that the Lord had determined to bring vpon the Iewes 70. yeares captiuitie in Babylon. He knew also, that God had promi∣sed to put an ende to that captiuitie, at the end and tearme of those yeares. Now what did Daniel in this case? Vpon knowledge of the will of God in that point, during the said time, he praied not vnto the Lord for Dan. 9. deliuerance of his people: But when he vn∣derstood that the time drewe neere, wherin it was the wil of God, that the Iewes should v. 2. returne out of captiuitie, then by faith ap∣plying the promise of God to that particu∣lar time: he besought the Lord in praier and supplications, with fasting, in sackcloth and ashes, and the Lord gaue eare vnto his prai∣ers, and yeelded him a gratious answer. II. The second point is, that God, when he deferres deliuerance, doth it vpon great and weightie causes and considerations, best knowne to himselfe. The first wherof is, that thereby he might humble men throughly, and bring them
to an vtter deniall of themselues, and conse∣quently cause them, to learne patience in af∣fliction; which they would not learne, if they might be their owne caruers, and haue spee∣dy deliuerance from the crosse, at their own wills and pleasures. Secondly, that beeing afflicted, they may acknowledge whence their deliuerance comes; yea, whence they doe receiue not onely that, but euery other good benefit, which they inioy; namely not from thēselues, or any creature, but onely from the Lord; and accordingly may learne to value and prize his gifts, at their deserued excellencie. For it is a true saying, and often verified in affliction & want, that benefits easily obtained, are lightly regarded, and sooner forgotten. Thirdly, that by the continuance of the crosse without intermission, he may make them to distaste the world, and consequently drawe them to the meditation of the life to come, wherein all matter of mourning shall cease, and all teares shall be wiped from their eies. Reu. 21. 4. Fourthly, the Lord deerreth deliuerance from affliction, that he might preuent grea∣ter euils and dangers, whereinto those that are afflicted might runne, if they had their heartes desire, and were eased not at his will but at their owne wishes. When the childrē of Israel came into Canaan, they were in∣formed, that they should dwell together
with the Canaanites, and Moses rendreth a reason thereof, Least (saith he) the wild beasts Deut. . 22. of the field multiply against thee. And for the preuenting of this euill, the Israelites must indure some annoyance by the Canaanites. Exod. 23. 28. Euen so the Lord keepeth his seruants vn∣der the crosse, for the preuenting of greater sins & offences. This should stay the mindes of men, & make them content to wait vpon God for deliuerance, when they are afflicted. III. The third and last point is, that God alwaies hath and doth exercise his best ser∣uants, with long and continued crosses. A∣braham was childlesse, till he was 70. yeares of age, and at those yeares the Lord promi∣sed him issue. But this promise was not accō∣plished til a long time after, when he was an hundred yeares old. Dauid had a promise to be king of Ierusalem, and Iuda; but the Lord exercised him by many and grieuous afflicti∣ons, before he came to the crowne, in so much, that he saies of himselfe, that his eies failed with waiting vpon his God. Zacharie & Psal. 119. 82. Elizabeth praied to god, both of thē in their youth, & many yeares after for issue, but the Lord granted not their request til they were Luk. 1. 13. olde. To adde no more examples; by these we see the Lords dealing, euen with holy men and women, his owne deare seruants, that he doth not alwaies grant their requests, nor condescend to their desires at the first, but
as it were holds them off, and suspends his grace and fauour for a time. And therefore if it shall please him, thus to deale with any of vs, we must from these examples be taught, to possesse our soules with patience, resting contented in his will, and waiting on his good pleasure to the ende. To conclude this point. Suppose, that the condition of Gods seruants be such, as that they finde no ende of their afflictions, but that they doe continue euen vnto death, what shall they doe in this case? Ans. Besides that which hath beene said before, for the resolution of this Question, I answer further, that first, they must still, e∣uen pag. 24. vnto death, liue by faith, and say with holy Iob, Lord, though thou kill me, yet will I trust in thee. Secondly, they must stay and releeue their soules in the meane time, with these and such like meditations. I. That it is the will and pleasure of God, that we should through many afflictions, en∣ter into the kingdome of God. Act. 14. 22. Now it is the propertie of a true child of God, to rest content in his fathers good will and pleasure, euen when he is afflicted. Prov. 3. 11. My sonne—be not grieued at my correcti∣on, that is, let it not be tedious vnto thee, be content to beare it. Our dutie therefore is, meekely to subiect our selues vnto the hand of God, as the child doth vnto the correcti∣on
of his father. II. That though afflictions be long and tedious, yet God will at length giue a ioyfull and comfortable issue. For so himselfe hath promised, Math. 5. 4. Blessed are they that mourne, for they shall be comforted. Psal. 34. 19. Great are the troubles of the righteous, but the Lord wil deliuer him out of them all, Psal. 37. 73. Marke the vpright man, and behold the iust, for the ende of that man is peace. III. Afflictions be they neuer so heauie, in regard of continuance, yet they are in no sort comparable to those eternall ioyes, that God hath prepared for them that loue him. This was Pauls meditation, who indured the crosse, euen to his dying day. Our light affli∣ction 2. Cor. 4. 17. (saith he) which is but for a moment, wor∣keth vnto vs an excellent and eternall waight of glorie. And else where he professeth, that he did not count the afflictions of this present time, answerable in value to the glorie, which shall be reuealed vnto Gods children, Rom. 8. 18. Saint Peter tells them to whome he wrote, that in regard of their assured hope of eternall life, they should reioyce, though now for a season, they were in heauines through manifold tentati∣ons, 1. Pet. 1. 6. Lastly, the Author to the He∣brewes, comforteth the Church by this rea∣son, because it is yet a very little while, and he Heb. 10. 37. that shall come, will come, and will not tarrie. IV. Though God withholdeth his hand, in respect of deliuerance euen to death, yet
his loue is constant and vnchangeable, and the crosse which we vndergoe, cannot se∣parate vs from that loue, wherewith he hath loued vs in Iesus Christ, Rom. 8. 35. And thus much of the first particular distresse of minde, arising of outward afflictions. Sect. 3. The Second particular distres, is bodily and temporarie Death, which consisteth in the se∣paration Temporarie Death. of the soule from the bodie. And touching this affliction, it is demanded, How any seruant of God, may be able to indure with comfort, the pangs of death? For the answer hereof, two things are re∣quired: a preparation to death, and helps in the time of death. Concerning preparation, there are three I. Preparation to death. duties to be performed. The first and most principall, is commen∣ded vnto vs in the booke of Psalmes, where Dauid praies vnto God, Lord, make me to know mine end, and the measure of my daies. And Psal. 39. 4. Moses in like manner, Lord, teach me to num∣ber my daies, that I may applie my heart vnto wisdome. In which places, is remembred a Psal. 90. 12. notable dutie of preparation: to wit, that a man should resolue himselfe of death con∣tinually, and before-hand number his daies. This is done, by esteeming of euery day, as the day of his death, and accordingly do∣ing Account death present. alwaies that, which he would doe, if he
were now to giue vp the ghost. Secondly, in way of preparation, we must endeauour to disarme and weaken death, who is as an armed man, that hath his wea∣pons, whereby he seekes to destroy vs. And in this case, we must deale with death, as the Philistims dealt with Sampson. They saw by experience, that he was a mightie man, and by his power and strength, had giuen them many foyles; and therefore they laboured to know, in what part of his bodie his strength did lie. And after inquirie, finding it to be in the haire of his head, they neuer rested, till they had spoiled him thereof. And questionlesse, the time will come, when we all must encounter, with this strong & pow∣erfull Sampson, Death; In the meane while, it is a point of wisdome, to inquire wherein his power and might consisteth. When this search hath bin made, we shall finde that his weapons, are our manifold sinnes, and cor∣ruptions, both of heart and life. For as Paul saith, The sting of death is sinne. Therefore, that we may spoile him of this his furniture, 1. Cor. 5. 56. we must exercise our selues in the practise of two duties. First, vse all meanes for the cutting off of the locke of our sinnes, whereby alone Sa∣tan hath the vantage of vs; and these means are the duties of humiliation, inuocation, and true repentance. We must therefore humble our selues before God, be instant in
praier, for the pardon of our sinnes past, and present, and in this point giue the Lord no rest, vntill we haue obtained in our consci∣ences, the sweet certificate of his fauour and mercie in Christ, whereby our mindes may be staied and comforted. This done, it stands vs in hand to turne vnto God, to be carefull to leaue sinne, to en∣tertaine in our hearts, a resolued purpose and intention of new obedience, and conformi∣tie to the will, and commandement of God in all things. And this is the onely way in the world, to bereaue this our enemie of his ar∣mour, to pull the sting out of the mouth of this serpent, and consequently, euen in death to prèuaile against him. Thirdly, in way of preparation, our dutie is, euen before-hand (while we liue in this world) to indeauour, to haue some true taste of life euerlasting, and the ioyes of heauen. The due consideration whereof, will be of great vse. For it will stirre vp in our hearts, a desire and loue of perfect happines in heauen, yea a feruent expectation of Christs comming to iudgement: and it will further cause vs to say with Simeon, Lord, now let thy seruant de∣part in peace: and with the Apostle, I desire to be dissolued, and be with Christ. Touching this spirituall ioy and comfort in the holy Ghost, these Questions of Con∣science are mooued. I. First, how may we in this life haue and
nourish in our hearts, a true tast of eternall happinesse, and of the ioyes of the world to come? Ans. First, by a serious consideration of the euills that doe hinder, or preiudice our hap∣pines: and they are principally foure. One is, the Miserie of our liues, in respect of sinne, and the consequents thereof. For there is no man in the world, be he neuer so righteous, that can truly say of himselfe, I am cleane from my sinne, Prov. 20. 9. Yea, uen the regenerate, that haue receiued grace to be∣leeue, to turne vnto God, and to liue accor∣ding to the Spirit, doe finde by experience, Rom. . 14. 2. &c. corruption & rebellion in their minds, wills, and affections, which daily affordeth matter of sinning against God: and on the other∣side, hindreth and quencheth, all the good motions of the Spirit, that are in them. A∣gaine, such is the irreconciliable malice of Satan, that he takes vantage of mans corrup∣tion, and neglectes no time or opportunitie, to intrappeth children of God, in the snares of his temptations. And hence it is that man, by reason of his owne corruption, and the wicked suggestions of the Deuill, is at conti∣nuall strife with himselfe, hath daily occasion of sorrow, worketh out his saluation with feare and trembling, wading (as it were) euen while he liueth, in a sea of many miseries. The second euill, is the Vanitie of all things that are in the world. For whether we
consider the world it selfe, or the things therein contained, done, or suffered, there is nothing so sure and steadie, whereunto man hauing attained, can possibly rest fully satis∣fied, and contented; or which in the ende, will not prooue to be most vaine vanitie. And the truth hereof appeareth, in the expe∣rience of Salomon himselfe; who (beeing king ouer Israel) wanted neither authoritie, nor abilitie, and opportunitie, to take know∣ledge and triall, of all worldly things in all estates and conditions. And hauing euen of set purpose, carefully and earnestly searched into them all, at length he concludes, that the issue of all was vnprofitable vanitie, and vex∣ation o minde, as we may read in his Eccle∣siastes. The third euill is, the Changeable condi∣tion of our life in this world, whereby it comes to passe, that we are alway in a flee∣ting and transitorie state. For we are (as Saint Peter speaketh) but strangers and Pilgrimes, that wander to and fro in the earth, as in a 1. Pet. . 11. strange countrey, and still are making for∣ward to our owne home. We haue here no abiding citie. The houses wherein we dwell, Heb. 13. 4. are but Innes, in which we sojourne for a time: yea the bodies which we haue, are but ents and abernacles, alway readie to be shifted, and our selues to be translated into another place. Fourthly, by remembring, that Christ our
Head, beeing now in heauen, and we his members vpon the earth; during our life, we are in presence separated from our Head, and consequently, from that happie and glorious fellowship, which we shall inioy with him, and all the Saints our fellow-members, in the kingdome of heauen. This S. Paul no∣teth, when he saith, Whilst we are at home in the bodie, we are absent from the Lord: and 2. Cor. 5. 6. thereupon himselfe desired to be dissolued, and to be with Christ. Phil. 1. 13. Hauing thus entred into the due conside∣ration of the aforesaid euills, we must in the second place, exercise our selues in the fre∣quent meditation, of the blessed estate of Gods chosen, in the kingdome of glorie: who beeing translated out of this life, into the bosome of Abraham, are fully and per∣fectly freed from sinne, from Satan, from va∣nitie and miserie: haue all teares wiped from Apoc. . 4. their eyes: doe behold the face of God; are made like vnto Christ in holines and ho∣nour: 1. Ioh. 3. . and doe with him inherit the king∣dome, prepared for them, from the founda∣tions Math. 25. 34. of the world. In the third place, hauing throughly con∣sidered of these things, we must Compare the estate of this present life, in the respects before-amed, with the estate of that, which is to come in the kingdome of heauen: and laying them in a paralell together, we shall sinde the one, infinitely farre to excell the o∣ther
in regard of true ioy and comfort. And this will make vs, though liuing in the world, yet to vse it, as if we vsed it not: to haue our conversation in heauen: to thinke, 1. Cor. 7. 31. with Paul, that to be loosed, and be with Phil. 3. 20. Christ, is best of all for vs: to haue a true and Phil. 1. 23. liuely tast of the ioyes of the world to come, and accordingly with Abraham, Isaac, and Iacob, to looke for a citie that hath founda∣tions, whose builder and maker is God. Heb. 11. 10. II. Secondly, it is demanded, how a man may truly discerne, whether this ioy of the Spirit, be in him yea or no? For answer here∣unto, it is to be remembred, that there are sundrie properties wherby it differeth from carnall ioy. And these are principally fiue. First, this ioy is brought forth (as it were) of sorrow for sinne, and for the want of Christ. Ye shal sorrow, (saith our Sauiour Christ to his Disciples, meaning for his departure,) Iohn. 1. 20. but your sorrow shall be turned into ioy. These words, are not onely meant of his Disciples, but of all beleeuers, who vpon considerati∣on of their sinnes, and the spirituall want of Christ Iesus, doe mourn and lament. For not onely they, but all true beleeuers, are there opposed vnto the World. Againe, blessed are they that mourne: that is, being touched with Matth. 5. 4. causes of exceeding griefe, doe withall mourn for their sinnes: for they shal be comfor∣ted. On the other side, carnal ioy, as it hath his beginning from the flesh, & ariseth of things
pleasing thereunto, so it ends in sorrow and heauinesse. In the end, reioycing is turned into mourning, saith Solomon. And, Woe e to you Prou. 14. 13. that now laugh: for ye shall weepe. Luk. 6. 25. Secondly, the ioy of the Spirit, is a fruit of righteousnes: that is, it issueth and floweth from Christ knowne and beleeued, to be made vnto vs of God, wisdome, righteous∣nes, Rom. 14. 17. sanctification, and full redemption. For from hence, followes peace of conscience, and from peace, comes ioy in the Holy Ghost. Contrariwise, the ioy of the flesh, ari∣seth only from the sudden feeling of some worldly delight: and therfore cannot bring any sound peace, vnto the conscience of the man possessed of it. Thirdly, spirituall ioy is founded in the holy vse of the Word, Sacraments, and Prai∣er: and in the practise of Christian duties of mercie, oue, iustice, &c. The other is not so. For the world conceiueth a ioy besides the word, o of the exercises of inuocation and repentance: which stands in the practise of crueltie, malice, oppression, iniustice, and all manner of impietie. And hence it is, that ha∣uing spēt their daies in such matter of reioy∣cing, at length in a momēt they go down to hell. Iob. 1. 13, 14, 5. Fourthly, heauenly ioy is so fixed & roo∣ted in the heart, that it cannot be remooued thence. Your ioy shal no man take from you, saith Io. 1. . Christ. It must needes therefore be true and sound, yea able to swallow vp all matter of
griefe, and heauinesse: whereas the other is neuer sincere, but with the sweetnes thereof, hath alwaies mingled some bitternes. Euen in laughter (saith Salomon, speaking thereof) the heart is heauie. When the face of the wic∣ked Prou. 14. 13. man shineth, and his countenance is pleasant, euen then is he inwardly sorrow∣full, and his minde is troubled. Lastly, the ioy of the Spirit is eternall: abi∣ding in the mind of man, not onely for the terme of this life, but for euer, in the world to come. So is not the reioycing of the world in earthly things: for it is fading and deceit∣full, as the things themselues be, wherein it is placed: it hath the beginning in corrupti∣on, and endeth with this present life. The Luk. 12. 20. and 16. 22. examples of the two rich men in the Gos∣pel, doe manifest this truth. And to this pur∣pose, is the speech of Zophar, in the booke Iob. 20. 5. of Iob, that the reioycing of the wicked, is very short, & the ioy of hypocrites is but a momēt, &c. By these fiue properties, may we put a true difference, betweene earthly and heauenly reioycing, and consequently discerne of them, euen in our seleues. And if we perceiue this ioy of the Spirit, (rightly conceiued and grounded in the right vse of the word, and Sacraments; as also in the exerci∣ses of inuocation, faith, and repentance,) to take place in our soules and consciences, we shall finde it of force, to moderate and alay the very terrours of death. And so
much for Preparation. II. Helpes in time of Death. Now the helpes to be vsed in the time of death, are manifold: the summe of all may be reduced to two heads; Meditations, and Practises. Touching Meditations, we must in the first place, consider Death in a double re∣spect; one, as it is in it owne nature, and ano∣ther, as it is changed and qualified by the death of Christ Death in it owne nature, is a Curse, or fore er of comdemnation, the very gates and suburbs of Hell it selfe: but beeing qualified by Christ, it is a blessing, an end of all miseries, a full freedome from all dangers, a short passage vnto ioy, an en∣trance into euerlasting life, a quiet sleepe, voide of all annoyance, by dreames and fan∣tasies. And the graue a resting chamber, yea a bed perfumed by the death of Christ, for the bodies of all the Elect, out of which when they awake, they shall be admitted & receiued into the presence of God in hea∣uen. Secondly, we are to consider, that there be three degrees of eternall life. The first whereof, is in this world before we die, and it is then, whē we begin to repent & beleeue in Christ, and to be assured in conscience that God the father is our father, Christ our redeemer, & the holy Ghost our comforter. For this is eternall life, to know God and him Iohn 17. . whome he hath sent Iesus Christ. The next de∣gree
is in death: for death cuts off al sin, origi∣nall & actuall: death frees vs from al wordly miseries: death prepareth the bodie, that it may be fit to enter into eternall happinesse together with the soule, which is alreadie in heauen. The last degree is, when bodie & soule reunited, goe both together into eter∣nall and euerlasting glory. Our third meditation is, that that there is a mysticall vnion and coniunctiō, betweene Christ and euery beleeuer, & that not onely in regard of soule, but of bodie also; which beeing once knit, shall neuer be dissolued, but is eternall. Wherevpon the dying, dead rotten, and consumed bodie remaineth still a member of Christ, abideth within the co∣uenant, and is and shall be euer, a temple of the Holy Ghost. Thus Adam, and Abraham, which are dead, so many thousand yeares a∣goe, yea euery true beleeuer, from them to the end of the world, shall arise at the last day in body to glory, by the power of their coniunction with Christ. In the winter sea∣son, we see the most trees voide of leaues, buddes, and blossomes: so as they seeme to vs to be dead, and yet neuerthelesse there is a sappe in the roote of them, which in the Spring wil ascend, & reuiue the decaied brā∣ches. Euen so it is with our bodies, which though they be corrupted, rotten, burnt or eaten with wormes, or deuoured by wild beasts, so as they may seeme to be vtterly
perished, yet there is (as it were) a secret and hidden sap in them, (by reason of their vni∣on with Christ) by which they shall be rai∣sed, reuiued, and quickned, being made like vntothe glorious bodie of Christ their head, with whome they shall raigne, and liue for euermore. Helpes in practise are two; First, he that will beare with comfort the pangs of death, must labour that he may die in faith: and that is done, by laying hold of the promise of God, touching forgiuenes of sinnes and life euerlasting by Christ. All these (saith the Heb. 1. 3. holy Ghost) died in faith, namely, Abel, E∣noch, No, Abraham, and Sarah, all laying hold of the promise of life by Christ. When Iacob on his death-bed, was blessing of his children, he brake forth into this heauenly Gen. 49. 18. speach, O Lord, I haue waited for thy saluation. In which words it is plaine, that his faith re∣sted on the mercie of God, and by hope he waited for his saluatiō, & our Sauiour Christ saith, As Moses lift vp the serpent in the wilder∣nesse, Ioh. 3. 14. 15. so must the sonne of man be lift vp, that whosoeuer beleeueth in him, might not perish, but haue life euerlasting. Out of which words the forenamed duty may be learned, that looke as the childrē of Israel, being stung with fiery serpēts, & that vnto death, we healed by loo∣king vp to the brasē serpēt erected by Moses: so whē we are stūg with sin & death, we must euer remēber by faith to looke vpon Christ.
But specially when we are dying, then it is our part, to sixe the eies of our soules, by faith vpon him; and thereby shall we escape death and be made partakers of eternall life and happinesse. Notable is the example of Christ, who as he was man; alwaies fixed his trust and considence in his fathers word, e∣specially at his end. For when he was dying, and the pangs of death seazed vpon him, he cries vnto the Lord, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? and againe, Father into thy hands I commend my spirit: which words are full of faith, and doe bewray what great affiance he placed in his fathers loue, &c. When Dauid in an extremitie, saw nothing before his eies but present death, the people in tending to stone him, at the very instant (as the text saith) he comforted himselfe in the Lord his God; but how? by calling to minde 1. Sam. 30. 6. the mercifull promises, that God had made vnto him, and by applying them vnto his heart by faith. And Paul saith of himselfe, & the rest of the faithfull, that they receiued the sentence of death in themselues, that they might . Cor. 1. 9. not trust in themselues, but in God. From these examples it followes, that they which desire with comfort to beare the pangs of death, must die by faith; that is, they must set before their eies, the promise of remission of sinnes, and life euerlasting, and depend vpon it, wrapping (as it were) & infolding thēselues in it, as in a close & warm
garment, that will keepe them safe and sure, against the winde and weather of temptati∣on. The second Practise in the time of death is, to die in obedience; which is nothing else, but willingly, gladly, and readily, without murmuring, to submit our selues vnto Gods will, in bearing the paines of death. A most worthie president of this obediēce, we haue in our Sauiour Christ, when he said vnto his father, Not my will, but thy will be done; thereby submitting his will, to his Fathers wil, touch∣ing the death which he then suffered. Yea when he was dying, it is said of him, that he gaue vp the Ghost; that is, he did most willingly surrender vp his soule into the hands of God his father. And this his exāple at the time of his departure, must be a rule of directiō vnto vs, vpon the like occasion. Hence it is, that in the third petitiō of the Lords praier, amōgst other things, we pray for obedience to the will of God in suffering afflictions, yea euen in the last and greatest, which is death it self. True it is, that obedience to God in death, is against corrupt nature; and therefore our dutie is, the more to inure our selues, to the performing of it: and that which the blessed Apostle said of himselfe, I die daily, ought to be continually our resolution and pra∣ctise. If we shall inquire, howe this may be done; the answer is, whē God layeth afflicti∣ons
vpon vs, in our life time, then by endea∣uouring to beare them with patience, meek∣nes, and lowlines. For euery affliction, is (as it were) a pettie death: and if we doe in it, subiect our selues to the hand of God, wee shall the better obey him, in the great death of all: and thus doing, whensoeuer God striketh vs with death, we shall with comfort endure the same. Sect. 4. The Third particular Affliction or distresse, is Satanicall molestation, whereby both per∣sons, Satanicall molestation. and places of mansion, or abode, are either possessed, or otherwise molested by the malice of the Deuill. I. Touching this Affliction, the Question of Conscience is, How such persons as are possessed, or feare possession, or else indure molestations by the Deuill in their houses, may haue their minds quieted and staed, and consequently, in that case be remedied! And here two things are generally to be considered, in way of Answer. First, it is to be remembred, that possession is knowne by two signes. The one is, when the Deuill is euidently present, either in the whole bodie, or in some part of it. The o∣ther, when he hath rule of the said bodie, ei∣ther in whole or in part: so as the partie him∣selfe, hath not that vse of his bodie, which he would. As for example: when the Deuill
possesseth the instruments of the voice, as the tongue, and makes a man to speake Latine, Greeke, Italian, or other tongues, which he vnderstandeth not. Both these things were found in them that were possessed, in the time of our Sauiour Christ. Secondly, we must consider, it falleth out oftentimes, that straunge diseases doe seaze vpon men, arising from corrupt humours in the bodie; yea men and women may haue straunge passions vpon naturall causes vn∣knowne; and these will sometimes haue strange and extraordinarie effects in them, which the art of Physicke neither can search out, nor cure; and yet they are neither acts of witchcraft, nor reall possessions. As when God laid extraordinarie diseases on the Co∣rinthians, for the contempt of his Word and Sacraments, 1. Cor. 11. 30. Like vnto which, he worthily inflicts vpon men in these daies, for the same and other sinnes. Now to stay the minde in this case, these Rules are carefully to be thought vpon. First of all, it is to be remembred, that though Satans malice and power, be very great and large: yet he can not practise the same, against the childrē of God, whē, where, and how he listeth. The malice which Satan beares to mankind, and principally to the members of Christ, appeares in this, because he is saide, to accuse them before God, day and Reuel. 20. 2. night. And, as a roaring lyon, to walke about the
world, seeking whome he may deuoure, 1. Pet. 5. 8. Againe, the Scripture noteth him, to be a powerfull Spirit, whose strength farre excee∣deth and surpasseth the might of any man or creature, that is not of an Angelical nature, as himselfe is. For he is tearmed a Prince of the aire, and the god of this world; his power rea∣cheth euen to the spirits and soules of men, whereby he worketh in the children of diso∣bedience, Ephes. 2. 2. His principalitie is so great, that no strength, no defence of man is able to withstand it, vnlesse man take vnto himselfe the whole armour of God, Eph. 6. 10. Now although the Deuill be so malitious an enemie of mankind, that he ceaseth not to deuise, whatsoeuer may be hurtfull vnto them; and withall so powerfull in his at∣tempts, that no man by his one proper strength, is able to resist him: yet he cannot put the least part of his power in execution, in what time, place, or manner he desireth. The reason is, because God hath determined his power, by certaine bounds and limits, which he cannot passe: and they are especi∣ally two. The one is, his owne nature, whereby he is a creature, and therefore finite. Hence it is, that he can neither know, nor doe any thing that is beyond the reach or capacitie of his nature, or aboue the power and skill of a creature. For example, he cannot directly and immediatly know the deepe things of
God, vnlesse they be reuealed vnto him: nor yet the secrets of mans heart. None knoweth the things of a man, saue the spirit of a man, which is in him: ouen so, the things of God know∣eth none, but the spirit of God, 1. Cor. 2. 11. A∣gaine, he cannot doe that which is truly and properly a miracle, the cause whereof is hid∣den and vtterly vnknowne, and which comes not within the power and order of nature. For this is proper vnto God, who onely doth things simply wonderfull, Psal. 77. 14. The second thing whereby Satans power is restrained, is the will of God. For looke as the sea, beeing by nature, apt to ouerflow the whole earth, is kept in, and shut vp within the shore, (as it were) with dores or gates, that it cannot breake forth; and that by the Lord himselfe, who hath established his de∣cree vpon it, Iob 38. So though Satan be by nature strong, and his malice great, yet can he doe nothing at all, no nor execute his na∣turall power, to the hurt and preiudice of a∣ny man, without the will and permission of God. Thus the euill spirit, could not goe forth to deceiue Ahab, vntill the Lord had said vnto him, Goe and thou shalt preuaile, 1. King. 22. 22. Thus the Deuill could not touch the bodie, children, goods, or friends of righteous Iob, whilest he was fenced and fortified, by the power and prouidence of God. But when the Lord, in regard of Iobs outward estate, had giuen leaue, and said, Loe
all that he hath is in thine hand, then did he ex∣ercise his power, to the vtmost: yet so farre onely, as he was permitted, and no further. Iob. 1. 12. The consideration of this first point, that Satans power is determined by God, will serue to stay the minds of those, whose per∣sons, houses, or friends are molested by him. For hereupon it followeth, that God, who hath the Deuill bound vp (as it were) in chaines, will not suffer his power to be in∣larged, against his owne children, to their de∣struction and confusion: but so farre forth a∣lone, as shall be expedient for their good and saluation. Againe, that God beeing their fa∣ther in Christ Iesus, they may in the time of such affliction, haue accesse vnto him, & call vpon him, for the restraint of Satans power and malice, and consequently, for the deliue∣rance of them and theirs. A second Rule is this. Such persons must haue recourse to God in his word, in which he promiseth his presence and protection, to his children, in their greatest dangers. And namely, that there shall no euill come vnto them, neither any plague shall come neere their dwel∣ling: Psal. 91. 10, 11. because he will giue his Angels charge ouer them, to keepe them in all their waies. Againe, that he will be a wall of fire, round about his peo∣ple. Zach. 2. 5. that he will extend peace ouer his Church, like a flood, Isa. 66. 12. And that there shal be no sorcery against Iacob, nor soothsaying in
rael, Numb. 23. 22. And yet if God sees it to be good for his children, to be tried by pos∣sessions or witchcraft, in this case the pro∣mise frees them not. For all temporall bles∣sings are promised conditionally, so farre forth as they may stand with Gods good will and pleasure, and withall may make for the good of his children. Howbeit herein lies the comfort, that though such calamities befall them, yet they shall turne to their good, rather then to their hurt. This point well considered by the way, bewraieth the great presumption of some, who are not a∣fraid to say, their faith is so strong, that the Deuill cannot touch them. Thirdly, it must be considered, that the best seruants of God, haue beene in their times molested by the Deuill. Christ in his Math. 4. 5. second temptation, was carried by the De∣uill, from the wildernessé, to a wing of the Temple of Ierusalem. The children of Iob, were destroied by the Deuill, & he himselfe was filled with boches, and sores. A cer∣taine woman, euen a daughter of Abraham, that is, one following the faith of Abraham, Luk. 13. 16. was troubled with a spirit of infirmitie, eigh∣teene yeares together. And the daughter of the woman of Canaan, was grieuously vexed with a Deuill. Math. 15. 21, 22. Fourthly, men in this case, ought by faith to lay fast hold vpon the promise of life e∣uerlasting, and wait the Lords leisure, not
limiting him in respect of time, or meanes of deliuerance. This was the practise of Iob, Though he kill me, yet will I trust in him. And of Iob 13. holy Abraham, who did not limit God, but was content to doe with Isaac, what the Heb. 11 17. Lord would: and though it was in likeli∣hood, a meane to bereaue him of all posteri∣tie, yet still he kept himselfe to the promise. Lastly, men must in this case, seeke and sue vnto God by praier, either for deliuerance, if it may stand with his good will and plea∣sure, or els for patience, that they may meek∣ly and patiently beare that particular affli∣ction. II. In the molestation and annoyance of hou∣ses by spirits, two things are to be remem∣bred. First, men must not consort together, and abide there, where it is certenly knowne, that the Lord hath giuen the Deuill power and libertie; least in so doing, they tempt the Lord. Our Sauiour Christ, did not of his owne priuate motion and will, betake him∣selfe into the wildernes, but by the direction of the Holy Ghost, Math. 4. 1. Paul in like manner, did not of his owne head goe to Ie∣rusalem, but vpon the motion of the Spirit, Act. 20. 22. In the light of these examples men arc taught, not to cast themselues, into any places of apparant danger: much lesse to frequent those, which God hath deliuered vp, into the power of Satan. And this con∣demneth
the rash, and headie conceits of some persons, who vpon confidence of their owne strength, doe put themselues into needelesse dangers, hauing neither extraor∣dinarie calling from God, nor any sufficient warrant out of his word. If it be asked, what men are to doe in this case? I answer, First, that they ought rather to flie to God by praier, and to draw neere vnto him in their hearts: and he in mercie will draw neere vnto them. Secondarily, that which we doe in meats and drinkes, is also to be done in the houses and places where we dwell. And what is that? we must sanctifie them to our vse, by the word and prayer. Noah at Gods com∣mandement, went into the Arke, abode in it, and came out againe: and when he came forth of it, into the earth afterward; it is said of him, that he built an Altar, gaue thāks Gen 8. 20. to God for his deliuerance, and praied the Lord, to vouch safe him the vse of the earth, as he had before. Though Abraham had a promise of the land of Canaan, to him and his posteritie for euer, yet he went not out of his countrey toward it, till the Lord com∣manded Gen. 1. him: and when he was come thi∣ther, he built an Altar for the worship and Gen. 13. 3. seruice of God. The like he did afterward at Gen. 59. Bethel. And many yeares after, did Iacob offer sacrifice vnto God, in the same Bethel, when he came to dwell there. And for this
very end, in the law, by a speciall ordinance the first fruites of the haruest were offered to sanctifie the rest of the corne. And so much touching the second distresse. CHAP. X. Of the third Speciall Distresse, arising of the Tentation of Bla∣sphemie. THe third kind of trouble of mind, is that which ariseth of the Tentation of Blasphe∣mie, which in regard of the vilenes and vglinesse thereof: is not amisse tearmed by some, the foule Tentation. And it is, when a Tentatio fa. man is troubled in his minde, with blasphe∣mous cogitations, and thoughts, directly a∣gainst the Maiestie of God, the Father, the Sonne, and the Holy Ghost. As for example: to thinke that God is not iust, or mercifull; that he accepteth mens persons: that he hath not know∣ledge of things, that are done here below, or at least that de doth not regard them: that God cannot doe this or that: that he is iniurious to some men, and partiall to others, &c. These and such like blasphemous thoughts there be, which are not fit to be vttered amongst mē, forasmuch as they are most horrible, and ex∣ecrable,
as any can be conceiued. Sect. 1. That we may the better know this Temp∣tation, The Cause & Daunger. let it be considered, what are the fore∣runners thereof, and by what meanes it takes place in the heart possessed of it. Sometimes it commeth, meerely and one∣ly of the suggestion of the Deuill; which troubleth the phantasie, euen of those which are in that regard innocent, and casteth into their hearts impure and vngodly thoughts. Sometimes againe, it comes vpon men, by an euill custome: when as they willingly lend their eares, to leude and cursed speeches, that immediately tend to the dishonour of God, or the wilfull abuse of his word, his iudge∣ments, and mercies; and vpon the hearing, either giue their applause and approbation, though not expressely; or doe not hinder or stay them, as much as in them lyeth. Other∣whiles, it creepes into the heart of man by degrees, when he beginnes to waxe cold in Gods seruice, to make little conscience of those duties, that immediately concerne his worship, & consequently inures himselfe, to the taking of the name of God in vaine, by often and causelesse swearing, forswearing, cursing, &c. By these and such like meanes, is this foule and horrible tentation conua∣ed into the minde of man. Now the danger of it, whether it ariseth
from these, or any other causes, is exceeding grieuous, specially to those, that haue begun to chuse the way of truth, and to applie their hearts to serue God, and to feare his name. For it bringeth forth strange and fear∣full effects; as namely, desperation, and mani∣fold horrors & troubles of minde. Yea diuers persons haue hereupō bin astonished in such sort, that they haue bin mooued to make dis∣patch of themselues; beeing in their owne iudgement no better, then the very firebrands of hell. Sect. 2. Now for the Curing of this wonderfull trouble and distraction of Conscience, two The Remedie. things are to be done: to wit, Inquirie must be made into the next causes, whence this Tentation should arise: and after that, the Re∣medie is to be applied. For the first. Inquirie is to be made, whe∣ther the present distresse, had his beginning from the thoughts of a mans owne minde, or from the suggestion of the Deuill. For this is in all likelyhoode, the next way to mini∣ster Comfort, to the afflicted partie. It may be said, How shall a man discerne the thoughts that are from the Deuill, from his owne thoughts? Ans. He shall know them by sundrie notes. First by the entrance of thē into the mind. For those that coe from the Diuill, come
speedily, as lightning into a house: and they are after a sort, forced into the minde by vi∣olence, so as the partie cannot auoide them; and they come into the minde againe and a∣gaine, yea a thousand times in a day, so as by their often comming, they weaken the me∣morie, dull the senses, wearie and confound the braine. These are thoughts that come from the Deuill, and by him are couaied from without, into the minde of man. And if such cogitations, were from a mans own self, they would not come with so great vehemē∣cie and celritie, but with leisure and they would rise with more moderation, and lesse violence. Yea further, the frequent vse of them would not produce so many, and so fearfull effects as it doth. Secondly, such thoughts may be discer∣ned, to come from the Deuil, by this signe, because they are directly against the very light of nature, the sparkes whereof are not quite extinct in vs by sinne. For euery man thinkes reuerently of God by nature. But these cogitations are most wicked and deui∣lish, fastning vpon God, things that are most vile and monstrous: whereas commonly, the thoughts that arise from our selues, are not against the light of nature, though they be most corrupt. The third signe is, that at the first concei∣uing of them, the partie  smitten with an extraordinarie feare, his flesh is troubled; and
oftentimes, sicknes and faintings doe follow. But the thoughts that men conceiue of thē∣selues, cause neither feare, nor fainting, nor sicknes. Fourthly, blasphemous thoughts cannot come ordinarily from the hart of any, saue of those alone, that are of reprobate mindes. But the parties that are thus distressed, are honest, ciuill, and such as professe the Gos∣pell, at least in shew; yea sometime they be∣fall such, as are the true members of Christ. Therefore it is manifest, that they come from without, euen from the Deuill casting them into the minde, and not from within a mans owne selfe. In the next place, Inquirie must be made, whether the partie doth approoue, loue, and like these and such like thoughts, or no? To this he will answer, if he be asked, that he abhors them as the Deuill and Hell it selfe. Thus euen naturall men will answer, & that truly. After Inquirie thus made, the Remedie is to be applied. And the first and principall re∣medie, pertaines to doctrine, and instruction: in which the partie is to be informed of his or her estate; namely, that the foresaid blas∣phemies, are not his sinnes, but his crosses. For they are the Deuils sinnes, and he shall answer for them: and they are not ours, till we intertaine, receiue, approoue, and giue consent vnto them.
For proofe hereof, let this be considered, That vncleane thoughts which haue their residence in the minde of man, are of two sorts: Inward, and Outward, Inward are such, as haue their originall from the flesh, and a∣rise of the corruption of mans nature, though stirred vp by the Deuill. And these, at the ve∣ry first conceiuing, are our sins, though they haue no long abode in our mindes: and they are directly forbidden, in the tenth comman∣dement Outward thoughts are those, which haue relation to an outward cause or begin∣ning: of which sort are those euill thoughts, that be conueied into the minde by the De∣uill: and if we take no pleasure in them, nor yeeld consent vnto them, they are not to be accounted our sinnes, but the Deuills, by whome they are suggested, The truth here∣of appeares in Christs example; into whose minde the deuill cast this blasphemous tenta∣tion, thereby moouing him to infidelitie, co∣etousnes, and idolatrie: which neuerthelesse were not his sinnes, because his holy-heart gaue not the least approbation to them, but abhorred and repelled, them, and therefore was free from any taint of sinne, in or by them. This distinction of thoughts must be re∣membred. For hence it followes, that blas∣phemous thoughts, not consented to by vs, are not our sinnes, but the Deuills. Euen as in like case, whē one wickedly disposed, solli∣cites
another to treason, or murder: if the said partie listen not, nor yeild thereto, he cannot be holden guiltie of those crimes. Therfore, men must not feare those kind of thoughts ouermuch: at lest, if they please not thēselues ouermuch in them: because, though they be indeede their crosses, yet are they not their personall sinnes, for which they shall incurre the wrath and displeasure of God. Againe, they must let them goe as they come: they are not to striue against them, for the more they labour to resist them, the more shall they be intangled with them. The second thing to be vsed in way of re∣medy, for the staying of the mind in this ten∣tation, is, that though it should be graunted, that the foresaid euill and blasphemous thoughts are our sinnes, yet we are to re∣member, that they may through the mercie and goodnesse of God, be pardoned: if they be heartily and vnfeinedly repented of: yea further, that neither they, nor any other sins (except that against the Holy Ghost) doe condemne him, that praieth against them, & is heartily sorrie for them. It was Pauls complaint, Rom. 7. 19. That he did not the good which he would doe, speaking of the inward indeauour of his heart: and a∣gaine, that he did the euill which he would not, meaning in respect of the corruption of his nature. Now vpon this, that he indea∣uoured to doe that, which was agreable to
the will of God, that he loathed and detested the contrarie, and stroue against his corrupti∣ons, how did he comfort himselfe? Marke the wordes following, v. 20. If I doe that I would not: that is to say; if against my generall pur∣pose, I sinne against God; if I be sorrie for it, if I be displeased with my selfe, because I can not obey God, in that perfectiō I desire, It is no more I that do it, but sinne that dwelleth in me. Frō this example of Paul I gather, that if any man, haue in his minde euill thoughts, and doeth (as Paul did) grieue, because he therby offendeth God; if he doe abhorre them, and pray against them; he shall not be condem∣ned for them; they shall neuer be laid to his charge. The partie then that is troubled with with these thoughts, may vpō these grounds, stay his minde; and comfort himselfe. For if he shall not be condemned for them, then let him not feare them aboue measure. The third point to be remembred is, that the partie must not be alone. For this Tenta∣tion beginnes, and is confirmed and increa∣sed by solitarinesse; and the parties thus di∣stressed, loue to be apart by themselues, from the societie of others. And for that cause, in case they be lyable to this distresse, they must vse to converse with such company, as may afford them matter of speech and confe∣rence meete for them, and may exercise their mindes with heauenly meditations in the word, and singing of Psalmes, and such like
fitte and conuenient recreations. Our first parent Eue was tempted by Satan, when shee was apart from Adam: and our Sauiour Christ, when he was alone out of companie and societie, then did the Deuill most mali∣tiously assault him, with strong and power∣full tentations in the wildernes. The fourth point, to be remembred of the partie troubled is, that he must as heartily and earnestly repent him, of those his euill thoughts, as of euill wordes and deedes. For the truth is, because men are loose-minded, and haue no more care of their thoughts, then commonly they haue; therefore the Lord iustly suffers the Deuill to plague and torment them, by conuaying into their hearts, most vile and damnable cogitations. Furthermore, the said partie must labour to be renued in the spirit of his minde, that is, Eph. 4. 23, 24. to haue his minde inlightened by the spirit, whereby he may know and vnderstand the will of God in his word. After repentance for euill thoughts, there must follow watch∣fulnesse, and a carefull circumspection ouer all his waies; but principally he must haue an eye vnto his heart, the fountaine of all. Keepe thine heart with all diligence, saith Salo∣mon: that is, aboue all things see that thou Prov. 4. 23. countergard thy thoughts, desires, motions, and affections. That the heart of a man may be guarded, two rules are to be obserued. First, that the
word of God dwell plentifully in it, by daily me∣ditation Coloss. 3. 16. of the commandements, promises, and threatnings reuealed in the same. It is noted by Dauid, as a propertie of a blessed man, that he exerciseth himselfe in meditatiō of the Law of God, day and night, Psal. 1. By this meanes the heart will be clensed, and purged from vncleane and polluted moti∣ons, and so guided & directed, that it swarue not from God. This rule is of speciall vse. For therefore doe men hatch, and breed euill thoughts in their hearts, because they are not taken vp with holy meditations: and hence it is, that the heart of man, is made e∣uen a pray vnto the Deuill, because the word of God is not lodged therein. Excellent was the practise of Dauid in this case, who kept the word of God in his heart, that he might not Psal. 119. 1. sinne against him. The second Rule of the keeping of the heart, is to establish our thoughts by counsell. It is the wise mans aduise in so many words, Prov. 20. 18. wherein he would teach vs, that it is the propertie of a worldly wise man, in matters of waight, not to trust to his owne wit, but to follow the direction and counsell of wise and skilfull men. And if this be a sound course in matters of the world, much more ought it to be taken, in the maine matters of religion, and conscience, con∣cerning the heart and soule of man. And therefore by the lawe of proportion, it
giues vs direction, not once to thinke or conceiue, so much as a thought, but vpon aduice and direction taken at God and his word. Thy testimonies (saith Dauid) are Psal. 119. 24. my delight; and my counsellers. And what bene∣fit had he by taking such a course? surely, by the word of God, which was his continuall meditation, he gat vnderstanding, he became wiser then the auncient; it made him to hate all the waies of falshood: it kept him from declining from God, either to the right hand, or to the left. The same rule must be practi∣sed of vs, in the vse of our senses, our spee∣ches, and actions, and then shall the heart be kept cleane, and free from these temptati∣ons. And seeing this temptation is so daunge∣rous and fearefull, as hath beene said, & doth often befall men; our dutie is to make con∣science, of practising the foresaid rules conti∣nually. And thus much concerning the third kinde of distresse of Conscience.
CHAP. XI. Of the fourth Speciall Distresse, arising from a mans owne sinnes. THE Fourth Distresse of minde is that, which ari∣seth from a mans owne sinnes, or rather, from some one speciall sinne committed. And this kind of Tentati∣on is twofold: For either it is more violent, and lesse common; or lesse violent and more common. Sect. 1. The violent Distresse of minde, shewes it The violent Distresse. selfe by feares and terrours of the Consci∣ence, by doubtings of the mercie of God, by lamentable and fearefull complaints made to others. Now Question is mooued, Howe this violent distresse of minde, arising from our owne sinnes, is to be cured? Answ. That it The Cure. may be cured by the blessing of God, three things must be done. First, that particular sinne must be known, which is the cause of this violent distresse. And here we are to know, by the way; that it is an vsuall thing, with the parties thus di∣stressed, to dissemble and cloake their sinnes:
and therefore they will alleadge, that their trouble ariseth from some euill thoughts, from wicked affections, and from the corrup∣tion of nature: whereas commonly men are not distressed, in violent manner, for euill thoughts, affections, &c. but the violent di∣stresse commeth from soe actuall and odi∣ous sinne or sinnes done, which wound the conscience, and are the causes of great distra∣ction of minde: and they are many, which ha∣uing bin vpon occasion before rehearsed, I will not now repeat them. Onely this must be remembred, that the greater sinns against the third, sixt, and seuenth commandements, are the maine and proper causes of violent Quo occultins peccatum. cō: mais . distresses: and the more secret the sinne is, in regard of the practise thereof, the greater horror of Conscience it bringeth; and open offences doe not giue so deepe a wound vn∣to it, as secret and hidden sinnes. Secōdly, the particular sinne being known, Inquirie must be made, as much as possibly may be, by signes, whether the partie distres∣sed repenteth, yea or no. For except he hath repented, he cannot be fitted to receiue com∣fort: & vnlesse he be first fitted to receiue cō∣fort, he cannot be releeued in Conscience. Now if it be found, that the partie hath re∣pented, then care must be had in the next place, that his repentance may be renued, for the particular sinne committed. Thirdly, hauing thus done, the comfort
must be ministred, for the moderating, or ta∣king away of the distresse. And here remem∣ber by the way, that the comforts ministred, vsually and ordinarily, must not goe alone, but be mingled and tempered, with some terrors of the Law: that beeing thereby fea∣red, with the consideration of sinne, and of the wrath of God due vnto the same, the comfort may appeare to be the sweeter. The ministring whereof, in case of this distresse, would not be direct and present, but by cer∣taine steppes and degrees: except onely in the point of death: for then a directer course must be vsed. These degrees are two. First, the partie is to be informed of a pos∣sibilitie of pardon, that is, that his sinnes are pardonable, and though in themselues they be great, and hainous, yet by the mercie of God in Christ, they may be remitted. Now put the case, that the afflicted apprehendeth onely the odiousnesse of his sinnes, and the wrath of God due to the same, and in this fitte puts off the pardon from himselfe, and cannot be perswaded that his sinne may be forgiuen, what then is to be done? Ans. Then for the effecting of this first degree, certaine Grounds are to be laid downe, whereupon assurance in that case may be built vp in his heart. The first Ground of possibilitie of pardon Groundes of possibilitie of pardon. is, That the mercie of God is infinite, yea ouer all his works, Psal. 45. 9. That the death of Christ
is of infinite price, merit, and value before God. That God is much in sparing, Isa. 55. 7. That with the Lord is mercie, and with him is plenteous redemption, Psal. 130. 7. That Christs satisfaction is not onely a . price, but a . counterprice, 1. Tim. 2. 6. able to satisfie for the sinnes of all men, yea for them that haue sinned against the holy Ghost. For that sinne, is not therefore vnpardonable, because the offence thereof is greater, then the merit of Christ; but because th partie offending, nei∣ther doth, nor can applie the merit of Christ vnto himselfe. An ancient father vpon Cains wordes, My punishment is greater then I can beare, saith, Thou liest Cain, for Gods mercie is Augustin. greater then the sinnes of all men. The mercie of God was very great to Manasses, to Salo∣mon, to Peter, and to many others, though 2. Chr. 33. 23. 2. . 7. 14. 15. they were great offenders. The second Ground. Men of yeares, liuing in the Church of God, and knowing the doctrine of saluation, shall not be condemned simply for their sinnes, but for lying in their sinnes. Vpon this ground, I say, that men distressed must be grieued, not so much for committing of sinne, as for lying and continuing in sinnes committed. A third Ground. It pleaseth God many times to leaue men to themselues, and to suffer them to commit some sinne that woundeth conscience. It is true and cannot be denied. But we must withall remember, that sinnes committed, doe
not vtterly take away grace, but rather make it the more to shine and shew it selfe. For God in mercie turneth all things, euen sinne it selfe, to the good of them that be his: and there∣fore sinne committed, cannot either waste, or extinguish grace receiued, but by diuine di∣spensation, serueth to amplifie and inlarge the same; so as where sinne aboundeth, there grace aboundeth much more, Rom. 5. 20. And the Lord saide to Paul, beeing in great extremitie, 2. Cor. 12. 9. My grace is sufficient for thee: for my power is made perfect through weakenes. Hence it appeareth, that the grace of God is not vtterly lost, but appeareth liuely in the time of distresse. The fourth Ground is this. The promises of God touching remission of sinnes, and life eternall, in respect of beleeuers are generall, and in regard of all and euery man indefinite: that is, they doe not define, or exclude any person, or any sin∣ner, or any time; onely they admit one excep∣tion, of finall impenitencie. Here a question may be mooued, How long he that mini∣streth comfort, must stand vpon the possibi∣litie of pardon? I answer, vntill he hath brought the partie distressed, to some mea∣sure of true repentance: and this beeing done, then he is to proceede to the second degree of comfort. The Second degree of comfort is, to teach, that the sinne, or sinnes of the partie distres∣sed, are indeede pardoned. But it may be as∣ked,
vpon what signes may this comfort be applyed? I answer, vpon these two. First, if the partie distressed confesse, that he or shee is heartily grieued, that by their sinne or sinnes, they haue offended so louing and so mercifull a God. Secondly, if they professe, that they desire with all their heart, to be re∣conciled vnto God in Christ: and at least doe desire to repent for their sinnes; and withall doe carrie in heart, a purpose to sinne no more, but in all things, (as much as in them lieth) to performe new obedience vnto god, Luc. 15. 11. &c. Now for the better enfor∣cing of this comfort, some textes of Scrip∣ture, fitting this purpose must be rehear∣sed, a for example, Matth. 9. 12, 13. I came not to call the righteous, that is to say, those that iudge themselues righteous, but sinners, that is, those which are grieued, be∣cause in their owne conscience, they are vile and hainous offenders, to repentance. Againe, Matth, 11. 28. Come vnto me all ye that are wea∣rie, and heauie laden, and I will refresh you. And Christ saith, it was the end of his cōming to preach deliuerance to the captiues, and to set at libertie them that are bruised. Luk. 4. 18. To conclude this point, there remaines yet a further question to be resolued, and that is The Case of Reidination. this. A man after repentance, for some grei∣uous sinne, falls into it againe, and is distressed more then before: It is a cause somewhat grieuous. For we knowe, that if a man be re∣couered
of an ague, and through distemper in diet, or otherwise, makes a relapse into it againe, his case is often desperate, and he hardly scapeth with his life. In the same mā∣ner it is a dangerous case, if after repentance, men make a relapse into the same sinne a∣gaine. It may then be asked, how such per∣sons may be recouered after a relapse? I answer, though we find not any one par∣ticular example in scripture, of any one per∣son, that was restored againe after a relapse: yet neuerthelesse there is some comfort for such persons. Vpon what grounds may some say? Ans. Men that haue not so much as a drop of mercie, in comparison of God, must forgiue ther brethren often and many times, yea as our Sauiour Christ saith to Peter, till seuenty times seuen times, if they returne and say it repents them. Now god is infinite in all his attributes. He is much in sparing: with him is plenteous redemption: and there∣fore he will questionlesse, vpon true re∣pentance, often forgiue and forget, euen the same sinne iterated againe and a∣gaine. Nowe these persons are to be releiued in this sort. First they must haue their Consci∣ences setled in this point, that their relapse is pardonable, though very dangerous. For proof hereof read Esay, 2. 18. Where menti∣on is made of diuers Apostataes, that were by God called to repentāce, with promise of
don, if they turned vnto him. And in Luk. 15. the prodigall child, (by whome I vnderstand one, that after grace receiued, fell from his repentance and obedience to God) when he did but purpose in his heart to returne again, was pardoned, and receiued into fauour. In the 2. Cor. 5. 20. Paul saith to the Corinths, that were fallen away, We pray you in Christs steade that ye be reconciled vnto God. Secondly, beeing thus setled in consciēce they must againe repent them of their sinnes. Thirdly and lastly, they are to be comfor∣ted, with the promise of remission of sinnes, after that some signes of renewed repētance for sinnes past, haue beene giuen. Sect. 2. The Second kinde of this Tentation or trouble of minde, which is more common & The Moderate Distresse. lesse violent, befalls the Children of God: and it is a griefe of heart, more or lesse, whereby men are troubled, in respect of the want of grace in their hearts, and defects of obedience in their liues. Paul the deere seruant of God, was pos∣sessed with this trouble of minde, as we may read, Rom. 7. 23. And indeede there is no child of God, but more or lesse, one time or other, he feeles the stings of sinne, and the buffetings of Satan, which cause griefe in his heart. But this griefe is a notable grace of God, and therefore they which want it, must labour to haue it, and they which haue it,
must not seeke to put it out, but to keepe it in measure and order. And the Grounds of comfort, whereby the heart may be staed in this sorrow, that it be not immoderate, may be these. I. Ground. It is Gods will, that the worke of sanctification, or regeneration, should be imperfect in this life, and remaine vnfinished til death. This point needs no proofe, it is ma∣nifest both in the word of God, and in daily experience. The reasons for which God will haue it to be so, may be these. First of all, God giues grace, according to the measure, and manner of our receiuing of it, which in this life is imperfect. Some giftes of God in Christ, bestowed on his seruants, as remission of sinnes by his death, and iusti∣fication by his obedience, are not put into vs, but are only applied and made ours by imputa∣tion. Some other giftes there be, which are in∣fused and put into vs, as namely, sanctificati∣on, regeneration, the loue of God and man: and by one of these two meanes, to wit, ei∣ther by imputation or infusion, are all the giftes of God in Christ made ours. Yet be∣fore we can haue them, we must receiue thē: and the meanes whereby we receiue them is faith, which God hath ordained, to be the hand of our soules, to receiue his benefits be∣stowed on vs. Which faith because it is weake and imperfect, in this life, therefore the gifts which we receiue thereby, are
also imperfect. For though Gods benifits be like a bottomlesse sea, yet the faith, wher∣by we lay hold of them, is like vnto a vessell with a narrow necke, which though it be cast into the great Ocean, receiues but a little wa∣ter at once, and that by degrees, droppe by droppe, according to the widenesse of the mouth. And hence it is, that though the gifts of God without vs, which are ours by im∣putation, be perfect; yet all such graces as are put into vs, are weake and imper∣fect. Secondly, if any seruant of God, should be perfectly regenerate, and made absolutely holy in this life: then he should fulfill the morall lawe, and so become a Sauiour to himselfe: and by the tenour of the law haue life: and so should not Christ be a Sauiour properly, but only an instrumēt, to dispose vs, to the keeping of the law, whereby we might saue our selues. But there is one only all sufficient Sauiour, Christ Iesus: and the be∣ginning, the middle, and the accomplishmēt of our saluation, is to be ascribed to him a∣lone. Thirdly, it is the wil God, that his owne children, with whome he is well pleased in Christ, should be brought to nothing in themselues that they might be all in all out of themselues in Christ: being, as it were, emptied of selfe-loue, and of all confidence in their owne goodnesse. But if sanctification
should be perfect at the first, then a man should not goe out of himselfe, but would rather stay as he is, and rest contented in his owne goodnesse. For this cause Paul, after his exaltation, was buffeted by Satans temptati∣ons, that he might not be exalted out of mea∣sure, 2 Cor. 12. 7. but should content himselfe with this, that he was in the loue and fauour of God in Christ. II. Ground is; To consider, what makes a man professing Christ, accepted of God, and howe much he himselfe must doe, for this end? The substance of all things to be done of vs for this ende, that we may become the children of God, may be reduced to three heads. First of all, we must heartily bewaile our sinnefull liues past, and seriously humble our selues, in regard of our owne sinnes, both of heart and life; and if by occasion wee fall in∣to any sinne, we must not lie therein, but by speedie repentance, recouer our former e∣state. Secondly, in regard of the sinnefulnesse of our hearts and liues, in times past, we must rest our selues on Gods mercie alone, lying to the throne of mercie for the pardon of them all. Thirdly, we must indeauour in the course of our liues afterward, to performe obediēce to God in all his commandements; that thereby we may shew our selues thanke∣full
to him for his mercie, and profit in our obedience. For proofe hereof, First, consider the ex∣amples of this practise in Gods children. All that Dauid that worthie seruant of God could doe, after his sinnes committed, to bring himselfe againe into the fauour of God, whome he had offended, consisted of these very heads, which haue beene named; Repentance, Confidence, and Affiance in Gods mercie, and Performance of new obe∣dience. And this his practise was verified, a∣mongst many other places, specially in the 119. Psalme, & in all the Psalmes commonly called penitentiall. Againe, the Prophet Da∣niel was accepted of God onely for the do∣ing of these things, Dan. 9. And in like man∣ner was Paul, and the rest of the Apostles. Rom. 7. 1. Tim. 1. 12. Againe, for further proofe, let it be considered; what it is that makes a man to become a Christian, and ser∣uant of God: not this, that he is pure from all sinnes, and neuer slides or swares from obedience vnto God; but because when he sinneth and falleth, he is grieued with him∣selfe, and laboureth euery day, to mortifie his corruptions, which are the matter of sinne, in his heart, and life; and suffereth not sinne to reigne in his mortall bodie, but crucifieth the flesh, with the affections and lusts therof. Yet here remaines a great difficultie. Ma∣ny a good seruant of God, may, and doth
truly say of himselfe, I bewaile my sinnes, and doe in some sort rest on Gods mercie, and withall I endeauour to performe new obedience: but alas! here is my griefe, I can∣not doe these things as I would. In matter of sorrow and griefe, I am troubled with hard∣nes of heart: in occasions of boldnes and confidence, with doubtings:  endeauour to obey, with many slippes, and sundrie falls: For the staying & moderating of this griefe, these rules may further be remembre. The first Rule. If there be in the minde, a purpose not to sinne; in the will, a desire to please God; and in the whole man, n en∣deauour to performe the purpose of the minde, and the desire of the will: marke what followes vpon this: God in mercie ac∣cepteth the purpose and will to obey, for o∣bedience it selfe. Yea though a man faile in the very act, and do not so well as he should, the Lord accepteth the affection and endea∣uour for the thing done. Excellent is the say∣ing of an auncient Father, God accepteth that Accipit suum, & remittit tu∣. which is his, and forgiues that which is thine: his is the grace whereby we are inabled to en∣deauour to obey in the want of obedience, and that he accepteth; ours i the sinne and weakenes in performance of the dutie which he requireth, and that he doth in mercie for∣giue. Herein appeareth the great goodnes of God vnto vs, and we can neuer be sufficient∣ly thankfull for the same. But yet that
we may not here delude our hearts with conceits, and bless our selues in vaine: we must knowe, that God doth not alwaies ac∣cept the will for the deede, vnlesse there be a constant purpose in heart, a true desire in will, and some resolued indeauour sutable in the life, Malac. 3. 7. God spares them that feare him, s a father spares his own child. How is that? though the sick or weake child beeing com∣ed some busines, goeth about it very vnhandsomly, and so the deede be done to little  no purpose: yet the father accepts it as well done, if he see the childe yoelde vnto his commandement, and doe his indeauour, to the vttermost of his power. Euen so will God deale with those that be his children though sicke and weake in obedience. r how will some say, can God accept a worke of ours that is imperfect? Ans. So farre forth, as the obedience is done in truth, so farre forth God accepts it, because it is his owne worke in vs: and as it is ours, he pardons it vnto vs, because we are in Christ. A second Rule is laid downe, Rom. 7. 19. where Paul saith to this purpose, the good which I would doe, I doe not, and the euill which I would not, that do I. In these words, is set down the state of all regenerate men in this life: and the meaning is this. The good things which God hath commanded, I doe them, but not as I would, and the euill forbidden I
auoid, but not as I would. This we shall see to be true by comparing the voices of three kindes of men together. The carnall man saith, I doe not that which is good, neither will I do it, and that which is euill I doe, and I will doe it. Contrariwise, the man glorified, he saith, That which is good I do, and will doe it, and that which is euill I doe not, neither will I doe it. The regenerate man, in a middle betweene them both, he saith; The good things commanded I do, but not as I would; the euill things forbidden I a∣void, but not as I would. And this is the estate of the child of God in this life, who in this regard, is like vnto a diseased man, who loues his health, and ther∣fore obserues both diet and physick: and yet he often falls into his fit againe, (though he be neuer so carefull to obserue the rules of the Physitian) by reason of the distempera∣ture of his bodie: and hereupon is saine to goe to the Physitian the second time for new counsell. In like manner, Gods children, haue indeede in their hearts, a care to please and obey God; but by reason of sinne that dwelleth in them, they aile often, and so are aine to humble themselues again be∣fore him, by new repentance. Againe, the seruants of God are like to a man, by some suddaine accident cast into the sea, who in striuing to saue himselfe from drowning, puts to all his strength, to swim to the shore, and beeing come almost vnto it, their meetes
him a waue or billow, which driues him cleane backe againe, it may be a mile or fur∣ther, and then the former hope and ioy con∣ceiued of escape, is sore abated: yet he re∣turnes againe, and still labours to come to the land, and neuer rests till he attaine vn∣to it. III. Ground. He that is indeede regene∣rate, hath this priuiledge, that the corruption of nature, is no part of him, neither doth it belong to his person, in respect of diuine im∣putation. Paul saith of himselfe, Rom. 7. 17. It is no more I, but sinne that dwelleth in me. In which words, he distinguisheth betweene his owne person, and sinne that is in him. For in man regenerate, there be three things, the bodie, the soule, and the gift of Gods i∣mage restored againe. Now touching the corruption of nature, that is in his person, and so may be said to be his; but it belongs not to the man regenerate, it is not his, be∣cause it is not imputed to him, and so indeed is, as though it were not in him. The Apo∣stle 1 Thess. 5. 23. praies for the Thessaloni∣ans, that God would sanctifie them through∣out, and preserue their whole spirit, soule, and bodie. Of which place (amongst many) this exposition may be giuen. The Apostle spea∣king of men regenerate, and sanctified, makes three parts in them: bodie, soule, and spirit: and by spirit, we are to vnderstand, not the conscience, but the gift of regeneration,
and sanctification, which is the whole man bodie and soule, opposed to the flesh, which in a naturall man, is called the olde man, Rom. 7. And the praier which Paul makes in the behalfe of the Thessalonians, teacheth vs in effect thus much; that though corruption remaine in the regenerate, after regenerati∣on; yet in respect of diuine acceptation, he is accounted as righteous, and so continu∣eth: his sinne, (by the mercie of God in Christ) not beeing imputed to him to con∣demnation. And so much for that point. Now these Grounds of comfort, and o∣thers of the like nature, may serue to su∣staine and vphold the hearts of the children of God, when they shall be pressed and troubled, in consideration of their estate in this life, which cannot till death, be fully freed, from much weakenes and manifold imperfections.
CHAP. XII. Of the fift Speciall Distresse, arising from a mans owne bodie. THe fift and last kind of Temp∣tation or Trouble of minde, ariseth from a mans owne bodie. Before I enter to speake thereof, one Question, in the meane time, must be answe∣red, namely, How the bodie beeing an earth∣ly substance, should trouble or annoie the minde, considering that the minde is not bo∣dily out spirituall: for nothing can worke a∣boue it owne power: and it is against reason, that that which is bodily, should either alter or trouble a spirit. For answer hereunto, these things must be considered. Sect. 1. First of all, the actions of man, though they be sundrie, yet they all proceede from How the body troubles the minde. one onely fountaine, and common cause, the soule; and are done by the power thereof. The bodie of it selfe, is not an agent in any worke, but as it were a dead instrument, in and by which the soule produceth all acti∣ons and workes. Secondly, though all the actions of man come from the soule, yet the most of them
are such, as be performed by the bodie, and the parts thereof, and by the spirits that are seated in the bodie, as by instruments. In∣deede some actions of the soule and minde, are done without the helpe of the bodie; but I say, that the most of them, are wrought by the bodie, and spirits therein contained. And yet notwithstanding the Spirits in thē∣selues, are no agents at all: but the onely a∣gent in any worke, is the soule it selfe. For example: the vsing of the outward senses, as of sight, hearing, tasting, touching, smelling, as also of the inward, as imagination, memo∣rie, &c. all this is done by the braine, and the parts of the braine, as proper instruments. All affections both good and bad, come from the soule, but yet they are done and acted in, and by meanes of the heart and vitall spi∣rits. So also the powers of life and nourish∣ment proceede from the soule; and yet they are done and wrought by the liuer, and other inward parts, as instruments whereby the soule nourisheth the bodie. In a word, there is no naturall action in man, but for the effe∣cting thereof, the parts of the bodie are v∣sed as it were the hands and instruments of the soule; and all this comes by reason of the vnion of the bodie with the soule, where∣by they make one person. Hence it followeth, that when the bodie is troubled, the soule is also troubled. Now the bodie affecteth and hurteth the soule and
minde, not by taking away, or diminish∣ing any part thereof: for the soule is indivi∣sible. Nor by depriuing it of any power or facultie giuen it of God: for as the soule it selfe, and the parts thereof, so also all the fa∣culties of the same, remaine whole and en∣tire, without abating or diminishing. But by corrupting the action of the minde, or more properly, by corrupting the next instrument whereby the minde worketh, and conse∣quently the action it selfe. This may be conceiued by a comparison. A skilfull artificer in any science, hauing an vnfit toole to worke withall, though his skill be good, and his abilitie sufficient: yet his in∣strument wherewith he worketh being bad, the worke which he doth must needes be an imperfect worke. Howbeit the toole takes not away the skill of his workemanship, nor his power of working, onely it hinders him from shewing his skill, and doing that well, which otherwise he should and could doe well. In like manner, the bodie beeing cor∣rupted, hinders the worke of the soule; not by taking away the worke of the soule, or the abilitie of working: but by making it to bring forth a corrupt worke, because the in∣strument which it vseth is corrupt and faul∣tie. And thus we must conceiue of all the an∣noyances of the soule by the bodie. The Temptation followeth. The bodie causeth the trouble of minde two waies, ei∣ther
by Melancholie, or by some strange al∣terations in the parts of the bodie, which of∣tentimes befall men: in what sort we shall see afterwards. For troubles of minde thus cau∣sed, are more common, and as noysome as the most of the former. Sect. 2. Touching that which comes by Melan∣choly, Melancholy. sundrie things are to be considered for our instruction, and for the Remedie of that euill. 1. And first of all; if it be asked what Me∣lancholy is? I answer, it is a kinde of earthie and blacke blood, specially in the splene, cor∣rupted and distempered; which when the splene is stopt, conuaies it selfe to the heart, and the braine; and there partly by his cor∣rupt substance, and contagious qualitie, and partly by corrupt spirits, annoyeth both heart and braine, beeing the seates and in∣struments of reason, and affections. 2. The second is, what are the effects and operations of Melancholie? Ans. They are strange, and often fearefull. There is no hu∣mour, yea nothing in mans bodie, that hath so straunge effects, as this humour hath, bee∣ing once distempeted. An auncient Diuine calls it the Deuills bait, because the Deuill Esca Diaboli. Balneum Di∣aboli. beeing well acquainted with the complexi∣on and temperature of man, by Gods iust permission, conueies himselfe into this hu∣mour
and worketh strange conceits. It is re∣corded in Scripture, that when the Lord tooke his good Spirit from Saul, wherby he did carrie himselfe well in the gouernment of his people: and an euill Spirit came vpon him, he was in so fearfull a case that he would haue slaine him that was next vnto him: how so? surely, because God in iustice withdrew his spirit from him, and suffered Satan, to enter into the humour of choler, or melancholie, or both, and by this meanes caused him to offer violence to Dauid. Now the effects therof in particular, are of two sorts. The first, is in the braine and head. For this humour being corrupted, it sends vp noysome fumes as cloudes or mists; which doe corrupt the imagination, and makes the instrument of reason unfit for vnderstanding and sense. Hence followes the first effect, strange imaginations, conceits and opini∣ons, framed in the minde: which are the first worke of this humour, not properly: but be∣cause it corrupteth the instrument, and the instrument beeing corrupted, the facultie cannot bring forth good but corrupt acti∣ons. Examples hereof are well knowne, I will onely touch one or two. One is called the Beastiall or Beastlike Melancholie; a disease in the braine whereby a man thinkes him∣selfe to be a beast of this or that kind, and carries himselfe accordingly. And here with
haue all those beene troubled, which haue thought themselues to be . wolues, and haue practised woluish behauiour. Againe, it is said of Nebuchadnezzar, Dan. 4. 30. that he was driuen from men, and did eate grasse as the oxen, that is, behaued himselfe, and fed as a beast. Now some are of opinion that his humane shape was taken from him, and that he was transformed into a beast; at least that he had the soule of a beast in stead of an hu∣mane soule for a time. But they are deceiued. For there is no such transportation of soules into bodies, either of men or beasts. Others thinke, that Nebuchadnezzar was smitten in the braine with this disease of beastlike Melancholy, whereby he was so bereft of his right minde, that he carried himselfe as a beast. And this interpretation is not against the text: for in the 31. verse of that chapter it is said, that his minde came to him againe: and therefore in the disease, his vnderstanding, and the right vse of his reason was lost. And the like is true in historie, by diuers examples, though it were not true in Nebuchadnez∣zar. Againe, take another example, that is com∣mon and ordinarie. Let a Melancholike per∣son vpon the sudden, heare or see some fear∣full thing, the strength of his imagination is such, that he will presently fasten the thing vpon himselfe. As if he see or heare that a man hath hanged himselfe, or is possessed
with a Deuil, it presently comes to his mind, that he must doe so vnto himselfe, or that he is, or at least shall be possessed. In like man∣ner vpon relation of fearefull things, pre∣sently his phantasie workes, and he imagi∣neth, that the thing is alreadie, or shall befall him. And this imagination, when it enters once and takes place, it brings forth horrible and fearefull effects. The second effect or worke of Melancho∣ly, is vpon the heart. For there is a concord and consent betweene the heart and the braine, the thoughts and the affections: the heart affecting nothing but that which the minde conceiueth. Now when the minde hath conceiued, imagined, and framed with∣in it selfe fearefull thoughts; then comes af∣fection and is answerable to imagination. And hence proceede exceeding horrours, feares, and despaires, euen of saluation it selfe, and yet the Conscience for all this vntouched, and not troubled or disquie∣ted. 3. Thirdly, it may be demanded, whe∣ther there be any difference betweene the trouble of Conscience and Melancholy? for many hold, that they are all one. Ans. They are not all one, but differ much. Affliction of Conscience is one thing, trouble by Melan∣choly is an other: and they are plainly distin∣guished thus. First, when the Conscience is troubled, the
affliction it selfe is in the Conscience, and so in the whole man. But in Melancholy, the i∣magination is disturbed, and not the Con∣science. Secondly, the Conscience afflicted, hath a true and certen cause, whereby it is troubled, namely, the sight of sinne, and the sense of Gods wrath; but in Melancholy, the imagination conceiueth a thing to be so, which is not so: for it makes a man to feare and despaire, vpon: supposed and fai∣ned causes. Thirdly, the man afflicted in Conscience, hath courage in many other matters: but the Melancholike man feares euery man, euery creature, yea himselfe, and hath no courage  all, but feares, when there is no cause of feare. Fourthly, imagina∣tions in the braine caused by Melancholy, may be cured, taken away, and cut off by meanes of Physicke: but the distresse of Conscience, cannot be cured by any thing in the world but one, and that is the blood of Christ, and the assurance of Gods fa∣uour. 4. Fourthly, the way to cure Melancholy is this. First, the person troubled must be brought to this; that he will content him∣selfe, to be aduised and ruled by the iudge∣ment of others, and cease to rest vpon him∣selfe touching his owne estate: and by this shall he reape much quiet and contenta∣tion. Secondly, search and triall must be made,
whether he hath in him any beginnings of grace, as of faith and repentance, o no. If he be a carnall man, and wanteth knowledge of his estate, then meanes must be vsed, to bring him to some sight and sorrow for his sinnes, that his melancholy sorrow, may be turned into a godly sorrow. If he want faith and true repentance, some good beginnings thereof must be wrought in his heart. Thirdly, when he is brought to faith in Gods mercie, and an honest purpose not to sinne any more; then, certaine mercifull pro∣mises of God, are to be laid before him: and he must be exhorted, to rest vpon these pro∣mises, and at no time to admit any imagi∣nation or thought, that may crosse the saide promises. Now the promises are these, and such like: Psal. 34. 9. No good thing shall be wanting to them that feare God. Psal. 91. 10. No euill shall come neere the godly man. 2. Chr. 15. The Lord is with you, while you are with him, and if you seeke him, he will be found of you. Iam. 4. 8. Draw neere to God, and he will draw neere to you. And the best meanes to cause any man thus diseased, to be at peace with him∣selfe, is to hold, beleeue, and know the truth of these promises, and not to suffer any by∣thought to enter into his heart, that may crosse them. Moreouer, though the former promises may stay the mind, yet will they not take a∣way the humour, except further helpe be v∣sed.
Therefore the fourth and last helpe, is the arte of Physick, which serues to correct and abate the humour, because it is a meanes by the blessing of God, to restore the health, and to cure the distemper of the bodie. And thus much touching the trouble of mind, caused by Melancholy. Sect. 3. The Second meanes whereby the bodie Strange alte∣rations besides Melancholy. annoies the minde is, when it occasions trouble to the minde, by strange alterations incident to the body. When a man beginnes to enter into a Phrensie, if the braine admit neuer so little alteration; presently the minde is troubled, the reason corrupted, the heart terrified, the man distracted in the whole bo∣die. Thus from the trembling of the heart, come many fearefull imaginations and con∣ceits, whereof a man knowes not the cause. The same is procured by the swelling of the splene, by the rising of the entrals, by strange crampes, convulsions, and such like. The remedie hereof is this. First, it is still to be considered, whether the partie thus troubled, hath the beginnings of true faith & repentance, or no. If he hath, it is so much the better. If he hath not, (as vsually such per∣sons are meere naturall men,) then the first dutie is, to vse all meanes, to stirre vp in him some godly sorrow for his sinnes, to bring him to the exercises of inuocation, and to
some confidence in Gods mercy for par∣don. Secondly, this beeing done, meanes must be vsed to take away the opinion conceiued, which will be done by giuing him informa∣tion of the state of his bodie, and what is the true and proper cause of the alteratiō therof. This being knowne the griefe or feare con∣ceiued, will easily be staied. For take away the false opinion, and inform the iudgement, and the whole man will be the better. Thirdly, the opinion beeing altered and reformed, it may be the alteration in the bo∣die will remaine: the partie therefore in that case must be taught, that it is a correction of God, and that God doth not barely suffer the correction to be inflicted, but is the very author of it, and therefore the partie is to be well pleased, and to rest himselfe in that will of God. For euery present estate, whether it be good or badde, is the best state for vs, be∣cause it comes by Gods will & appointment. And thus much touching the distinct kindes of distresses of minde: whereunto I adde this one thing further, that if we make examination of the estate of persons as are troubled with any of these fiue temptations we shall not vsually find them single, but mixed together, especially Melancholy, with terror of Conscience or some other tempta∣tions. For the distraction of the mind will often
breed a distemper in the body, and the distemper of the bodie likewise will sometimes cause distraction of mind. Again, Melancholy wil oftēbe an occasion, (though no direct cause) of terror of Conscience; & in the same manner the conscience touched and terrified with sense of the haynousnesse of sinne, and the Heauinesse of Gods wrath, will bring distemper of bodie by sympathy, and cause Melancholie. In this Case, if Question be made, what is to be done, I answere, that for mixt distresses, we must haue recourse to mixt Remedies, using in the first place the best meanes for the rectifying of the minde the principall growndes whereof haue beene before deli∣uered; and then taking the seasonable aduise of the Phisitian, whose calling and seruice God hath sanctified for the cure and releefe of the bodie in case of extremitie. And so much of the first Sort of Questi∣ons, concerning Man simply considered in himselfe. The ende of the first Booke.

TO THE RIGHT HONOVRABLE, EDWARD LORD DENNIE, BARON of Waltham, &c. RIght Honourable. It vvas not vvithout speciall cause, that the fa∣mous Apostle of the Gentiles, en∣tring into a serious meditation of the Calling and vvke of the Mi∣nisterie, and grovving at length to some issue of his thoughts, crieth ut (as it vvere) in tearmes of Com∣plaint; And who is sufficient for 2. Cor. 2. 16. these things? For if nquirie be made into the reason of his demand, th Scripture shall ansvver for him; That Mi∣nisters are the Angels of the Lord of Hosts; the Inter∣preters Mal. 2. 7. Iob 3. 23. Math. 5. 13, 14. of his vvill; th Salt of the earth; the Light of the World, And their Calling is, to carrie the Embassage of Reconciliation; to manifest vnto man the pleasure of the Highest; to season the corrupted heart instrumentally vvith grac; to inlighten the darkened minde, by the di∣spensation of sauing knovvledge, as the Sunne doth the Aire by the brightnesse of his beames. Novv these high Tiles and greatvvorkes, euidently de∣claring the vveight and vvorth of that Honourable Com∣mission, are not either giuen or assigned, onely in respect of publike and ordinarie duties, vvherein by Diuine ordi∣nance they be made the mouth of God vnto Man by prea∣ching, Ierem. 15. 19. Nehem. 8. 7. and againe of Man vnto God by prayer. For these are determined vpon certaine times and places, vvhen and vvhere they are to be put in execution, according to the laudable Constitutions and Canons of particular Churches:
But in a further regard, as they haue receiued from God the Tongue of the Learned, and are indued vvith knovvledge and abilitie, to informe the Consciences of men touching euery action, vvhether personall appertaining to particular states, or relatiue emploied in the vvorshippe of God, and practise of Christian vertues, A gift, as no lesse necessarie, so of a farre larger extent then the other, and consequently performable vvithout limitation of time or place, in season, out of season, vvhensoeuer the minde requi∣reth resolution in Case of doubt, or Comfort in distresse. The light of this candle is therefore erected vp on high, and set in open vivv, that it may communicate it selfe not to all in grosse, but to euery one in person. The Lords Inter∣preter in this sense, is to dispense his vvill in euery place & Matth. 5. 15. time, to the poore vvidovv of Sarepa at her ovvne home; to the Noble uch of Ethiopia in his trauell; to Dauid, 2. king. 17. 9. Act. 8. 30. 2. Sam. 12. Math. 26. 75. that he may be dravvne to Confession of his sinne; to Peter, for his restoring after his fall; to the vveake, that they may be supported; to the strong, that they may stand; to th VVauering minde for resolution; to the Troubled soule for comfort and releefe. Hence it is apparent, that this Messenger of God must be (as Paul saith) a . complete man, in euery respect, armed 2. Tim. 3. 17. and . well appointed vvith necessaries appertaining, for all purposes, to the honour of his Lord, and the credit of his Calling. He should be not onely a learned Text-man, mightie in the Scriptures; a positiue Diuine, established in the truth; a man prouided ad oppositum, to vvithstand and con the Aduersarie; but a skilfull Casist, readie at all assaies vpon good grounds of knovvledge and obser∣uation, to giue a Rule, to yeelde a Reason, to speake a vvord in time to him that is vvearie. VVhich last propertie, to omit the rest, beeing so essential (as it is) to the Calling and condition of a Minister; yea of that importance (as heretofore I haue declared to your Lords.) it seemeth strange, at least in my poore conceit, that among so many graue and learned discourses, published by vvay of Definition and Disputation in matter of Religion, evv or none haue beene framed and conriued to this pur∣pose; that in this florishing estate both of our Church and
Commonvvealth, none haue emploied their indeauours in the vnfolding and displaying of this Subiect; yea, vvhereas they of the Popish Church haue beene so plentifull, or rather lauish in their Ioannis de Thabia. Angell de Clavasio. Raymundi, &c. Summes, Martini Az∣pilcust. Navar∣ri, &c. Manuels, Emanuelis Sa. &c. Aphorismes, Franci. To∣let. &c. Instructions, Iacobi de Graphii à Ca∣pua, &c. Determinations, &c. for direction of their Confessours in Case-points; that our Protestant Diuines for the most part, haue been so sparing and silent in speaking or vvriting of this Argument. Hovvbeit, the Lord in his most vvise prouidence, hath not vvholly denied this benefit vnto our Church. For not∣vvithstanding so great silence and forbearance in matter of Deuotion, as touching the rectifying of the Coscience, there hath beene of late yeares trained vp to this ende, a M. R. Green. ha. speciall Instrument of his glorie, vvho beeing in time throughly grounded in the principles of one part of the Coses; by many graue Counsells, and comfortable directions, fetched from the vvord, and gathered by long obseruation, hath cured the vvounds of many a distressed soule. And those diuine Tractaes of his, novv gathered together since his death, and communicated to the Church of God, are full of hea∣uenly meditations to that purpose. And as himselfe desired to leaue vnto posteritie, some memorie of his knovvledge in that kind, so the talent he receiued vvas not buried in his graue, but againe reuiued in the person of that faithfull Minister of Christ, the Author of this Booke, a man both for learning and pitie deseruedly reuerenced and renovv∣ed in the iudgements of all those that loue and embrace the Truth. VVho happily attempting the same course, and referring the vvhole bodie of his labours in preaching and vvriting thereunto principally; proceeded vvith much ad∣uantage, added vnto the Cases of Distresse other Heads of Questions, and in his latter time reduced them into such a Frame and Order, a might best serue for an Introduction of Case-diuinitie, for the helpe and incouragement of o∣thers. The first Part of vvhich Frame being formerly commen∣ded by me to your Hon. I haue againe emboldened my selfe to present you vvith the rest, that so the vvhole may haue the freer passage from you, to the common vse of others. VVherein I haue taken vp no nevv shion, but kept my
self to the commendable custome of vvriters in auncien∣tr ties, vvho haue betrusted the Church of God vvith the fruits of their indeavours, vnder the patronage of Honou∣rable and vertuous Nobilitie.  namely of that renoun∣ned Coloss 4. 14. Hieron. pro. log. in Lu &  Catalog. Scrip∣tor. Ecclesiast. Nicep. l. 6. c. 16. Luc. 11. Act. 1. 1. 2. Io. 1. Phisitian of Antioche, and of S.  vvho dedica∣ted their sacred vvritings, the one to the Noble Theophi∣lus, the other to the elect Lady and her children. And that vvhich mooued these holy penmen of Scripture to this practise, hath also incouraged  vpon the same respects, to offer this Treatise to your Honourable fauour: First, because your Lordship hath beene long So was Theo∣ph. with Lukes copies. Act. 1. 1. acquainted vvith th person, life, and labours of this man, and vvell grounded in t truth of Religion, the maine subiect of all his discourses. Secondly; the Lord hath inlarged your heart by his grace, to yeeld So did Theop. Luc. 1. 1. 4. and the Lad and ers. 2. Ioh. v. 4. entertainment to that truth vvhich he did teach and vvrite: and the manifestation of your vvilling minde to accept of any Treatise compiled by him, giueth sufficient proofe of this point, uen i mine ovvne knovvledge. Thirdly, you haue not contented your selfe to be barely informed in the knovvledge of the truth, but haue further desired This was also Theoph. his de∣sire. Luk. 1. 4. confirmation and assurance in the same. One instance hereof I must needes remember in this place: Tha sundrie yeares since, it pleased you to set him a speciall Taske, the interpretation of that golden Text touch∣ing the Gaine of the greatest commoditie in the vvorld, (Phil. 3. 8.) for your further vnderstanding of the same, as himselfe reporteth to your great commendation: And great reason, you should tast both of his former and Epist. dedicat. before the True Gaine. Latter fruits, who by your motion vvas incouraged to take the paines, and no doubt revvarded for his labour by a plentifull measure of your loue. Vpon these motiues, I haue novv at length exhibited vnto your Lordship the remainder of this present Introdu∣ction, my debt by bond of promise, and your due, by speciall right of patronage. If I be haply challenged of slacke pay∣ment thereof to this time, I desire to be holden excused. First, for that the totall Summe vvhich remained behinde vnpaied, vvas the greatest part, and therevpon required further respite, that it might be more easily collected, and more fully defraied. For though it be but one intir heape,
yet it consisteth of sundry particulars, all vvhich vvere to be throughly examined, that vpon the Account, there might be a mutuall agreement of the vvhole and the parts. And further, it vvas my desire, that seeing the debt must needes be discharged, and that to an Honourable person, it might be tendred in pure and Currant Coyne, vvhich might beare the triall of the touch-stone: A thing necessarie in these times, vvherein so much corrupt stuffe in this kind, passeth abroad from hand to hand. And thus heartily vvishing that these holy Rules of Religion and vertue, may be perused at your Lordships best leysure, and entertained in practise for your daily comfort and direction: craing also your Honourable acceptation of my carefull indeauour in publishing them to the common veivve of the vvorld, I most humbly take my leaue: Besee∣ching the Almightie, vvho hath alreadie graced you vvith the true revvards of Uertue, Honour, and Nobilitie, to e∣stablish the same both in your person and issue in this vvorld, and after this life ended, to giue you that eternall inheritance of honour and happinesse, in the kingdome of glorie.

THE SECOND BOOKE of the Cases of Conscience, concerning Man as he stands in relation to God. CHAP. I. Of the order of the Questions. HItherto I haue spoken tou∣ching the first sort of Questions of the Consci∣ence, which concerne Man simply considered in himselfe as he is a man. In the next place come to be handled and resolued the Questions concerning Man, as he stands in relation. Now man standing in a two-fold relation; either to God, or to man: according to this relation, the Questions come to be conside∣red in their seuerall places. And first we are to treat of the Questions of Conscience tou∣ching man standing in relation to God; to wit, as he is a Christian. All which for order sake may be reduced to foure heads. I. Concerning the Godhead. II. Concerning the Scriptures. III. Concerning religion, or the worship that is due vnto God.
IV. Concerning the time of the worship of God, namely the Saboth. CHAP. II. Of the Godhead. Touching the Godhead, there are two maine Questions. I. Question. Whether there be a God? BEfore we come to answer the Question, this one ca∣ueat must be remembe∣red, that it is a maine Ground and Principle in all Religions whatsoeuer, not to be doubted of, or called into question, That there is a God. Heb. 11. 6. He that commeth to God, must beleeue that God is. As for those that are commonly tearmed Atheists, which denie that there is a God, they are to be punished with death, as not worthie to liue in humane societie; and the greatest torment that can be deuised by the witte of man, is too good for them. For if those be holden as Traytors to an earthly Prince, and are most deseruedly adiudged to
death, that reuile his person, and denie his lawfull authoritie: then they that call into question the Godhead; are much more wor∣thie to be esteemed traytors to God, and consequently to beare the iust punishment of their rebellion, death it selfe. For this cause I doe not meane to dispute the question, whether there be a God or no; and thereby minister occasion of doubting and deliberation in that which is the onely maine Ground and pillar of Christian religi∣on: But rather my purpose is, in shewing that there is a God, to remooue, or at least to help an inward corruption of the soule that is great and dangerous, whereby the heart and conscience by nature denieth God and his prouidence. The wound in the bodie that plucks out the heart, is the most dangerous wound that can be: and that opinion that takes away the Godhead, doth in effect rend and plucke out the very heart of the soule. This Caueat premised, I come now to the point in hand, to shew that there is a God. And for our better knowledge and assu∣rance of this truth, we are to remember thus much, that God hath giuen vnto man a threefold light: the one of nature, the other of grace, and the third of glorie. And by these, as by so many degrees of knowledge, the minde beeing inlightened by God, recei∣ueth direction in the truth of the Godhead, both for this present life, and for that which
is to come. If it be demaunded, in what order God hath reveiled this light vnto man: I answer, that the light of nature serues to giue a be∣ginning and preparation to this knowledge: the light of grace ministers the ground, and giues further proofe and euidence: and the light of glory, yeelds perfectiō of assurance, making that perfectly and fully knowne, which by the former degrees was but weak∣ly and imperfectly comprehended. Of these three in order. Sect. 1. The light of nature is that light, which the Arguments from the light of nature, and Creation. view and consideration of the creatures both in generall and particular, affordeth vnto man. From the light of nature, there are fiue distinct arguments, to prooue that there is a God: the consideration whereof will not be vnprofitable, even to him that is best setled in this point. I. The first is taken from the creation and frame of the great body of the world, and the things therein contained: Rom. 1. 20. The inuisible things of him, that is, his eternall power and Godhead are knowne by the Creation of the world beeing considered in his workes. And out of this excellent frame of the world, the truth of the Godhead may be sundry waies proo∣ued and maintained. First, I would aske this question: This
goodly frame of the world, had it a begin∣ning, or no beginning? Let either part, or both be taken. Let it first be said, it had no beginning, but is eter∣nall, as the Atheist holdeth. Then I reason thus: If it had no beginning, the world it selfe is God, and all the creatures that are therein, from the greatest and highest, to the least and basest; yea, euery droppe of water in the sea, and euery corne of sand by the sea shore, are Gods. The reason is, because according to this opinion, they haue their being of them∣selues without beginning; and that which is a substance of it selfe, & hath no beginning, is very God. Againe, if the world had no beginning, then it hath also no ending. For that which is without beginning, is without ending. Now all things in the world are lyable to corrup∣tion, and consequently are subiect to an ende. For whatsoeuer is corruptible, the same is fi∣nite: therfore the world had a beginning. Now if it had a beginning; then I demand, how it was made? did it make it selfe? or was it made of nothing? If it be affirmed, that it made it selfe, then the world was before it was. If it be said, it came from nothing: that also cannot be. For nothing brings forth no∣thing: and that which is nothing in it selfe, cannot bring forth something: therefore it is absurd in reason to say, that nothing brought forth this world. And hereupon it must
needes remaine for a truth, that there was some substance eternall and Almightie that framed this goodly Creature the World, be∣sides it selfe. If a man comes into a large forrest, and beholds therein goodly faire buildings, and sundrie kinds of hearbs, and trees, and birds, and beasts, and no man: he will presently reason thus with himselfe: these buildings are the workemanship of some man, they were not from all eternity, they did not reare themselues, neither did the hearbs, the trees, the birds, or the beasts build them: but of necessitie they must haue some first ounder, which is man. In like manner, when we con∣sider this world, so goodly a creature to be∣hold, though we see not the maker thereof, yet we cannot say that either it made it selfe, or that the things therein contained made it, but that the Creator of it, was some vn∣created substance, most wise, most cunning, and euerlasting, and that is God. Secondly, from this frame of the world and the consideration therof, I reason thus. In the world there are foure sorts and kindes of creatures. The first bare and naked substan∣ces, that haue neither life, sense, nor reason in them: as, the sunne, the moone, the starres. The second that haue substance and life, but no sense nor reason: as, plants, trees, and hearbs. The third that haue no reason, but both substance, life, sense, and power to
mooue themselues: as, the beasts of the land, and fishes of the sea. The fourth are such as haue all, namely substance, life, sense, and rea∣son: as men. Now these foure sorts of creatures excell one another in properties and degrees. For the first of them which are meere substances, doe serue those that haue life, as the trees and the plants. The trees & the plantes serue the creatures that haue sense & life, as the beastes and the fishes. The beastes and the fishes serue man, that hath substance, life, sense, and reason. And amongst them all we see that those which haue more gifts are serued of those which haue lesse, as, the sunne and moone serue the plantes, the plantes and hearbes serue the beasts, and the beasts serue man, and that creature that hath most giftes is serued of all. Man therefore excelling all these must haue something to honour and serue, which must be more excellent then the other creatures, yea then himselfe, and that is a substance vncreate, most holy, most wise, eternall, infinite, and this is God. Thirdly, all particular creatures whether in heauen or in earth are referred to their cer∣taine particular and peculiar endes, wherein euery one of them, euen the basest and mea∣nest is imployed, and which they doe all ac∣complish in their kind. And this is a plaine proofe, that there is one that excelleth in wisedome, prouidence, and power, that crea∣ted
all these to such endes, and hath power to bring them thereunto: and who is this but God? II. The second sort of arguments drawn Arguments from the go∣uernment of the world. from the light of nature, are taken from the preseruation and gouernment of the world created; and these are touched by the Holy Ghost, when he saith, that God left not himself Act. 14. 17. without witnesse, in that in his prouidence he did good, and gaue raine from heauen, and fruitfull seasons, filling our hearts with ioy and gladnesse. The particulars drawne from the gouern∣ment of the world are these. First, our food whereby we are nourished, is in it selfe, a dead foode, void of life, and yet it serues to maintain and preserue life: wher∣as in reason, it is more fit to choke and stuffe our bodies, then to feede them. Secondly, our garments which we weare, are in themselues cold, and voide of heate, and yet they haue this vse to preserue heate, and to sustaine life in the extremitie of cold. Therefore there must needes be an omnipo∣tent and diuine power, that giues vnto them both such a vertue, to feed and preserue the life and health of man. Thirdly, the raine falling, and the sunne shining vpon one & the same plot of groūd, causeth it to bring forth in his season a hun∣dred seuerall kindes of hearbes and plants, wherof euery one hath a seuerall, and di∣stinct ower, colour, forme, and sauour:
whence comes this? Not from the raine, for it hath no life in it selfe, and besides it is in it selfe all one: nor from the sunne, or the earth: for these also in their kind are all one, hauing in them no such power, wherby they should be the authors of life: therefore the differen∣ces of plants in one ground, may convince our iudgements and teach vs thus much; that there is a diuine and heauenly power aboue, and beside the power of these creatures. Fourthly, take an example of the bird and the egge. The bird brings forth the egge: the egge againe brings forth the bird. This egge considered in it selfe, hath in it neither life nor soule, and the bird can giue it neither; for all that the bird can doe is to giue it heat, and no more. Within the shell of this egge is made a goodly creature, which, whē it comes to some perfection, it breakes the shell. In the shell broken, we shall see the nibbe, the wing, the legge, and all the parts and mem∣bers of a bird. Now let this be considered, that the egge brought not forth this goodly creature, nor yet the henne. For the egge had no such power or vertue in it selfe; and the hen gaue but her heat; neither did man doe it: for that which was done, was within the egge, and within the shell. It therfore was some other wonderfull power and wisedome that made it, and brought it forth, that sur∣passeth the power of a creature. Again, consider the generation of the silk∣worme,
one of the least of the creatures, and from it we haue a notable demonstration of a divine providence. This little worme at the first, is but a small seede like vnto linseed. The same small seed breeds it and brings it forth. The worme brought forth, and growing to some bignesse, at length weaues the silke; ha∣uing woven the silke, it winds it selfe within it, as it were in a shell: there hauing lodged for a time, it conceiues a creature of another forme, which being within a short space prfited, breakes the shell and comes forth a flie. The same flie, like a dutifull creature, brings forth the seed againe, and so conti∣nues the kind thereof from yeare to yeare. Here let it be remembred, that the flie ha∣uing once brought forth the seede, leaues it and dies immediately: and yet the seede it selfe, though exposed to wind and weather, and vtterly neglected of man, or any crea∣ture, at a certaine time within few moneths becomes a worm. Whēce should al this pro∣ceede, but from a creator infinitely power∣full and wise, who by his admirable power and prouidence, dispenseth life, beeing, and propagation, euen to the least things in their particular sorts and kinds? III. The third sort of Arguments from th light of nature, are taken from the soule of man. This soule is endued with excellent gifts of vnderstanding and reason. The vn∣derstanding hath in it from the beginning
certaine principles, whereby it knowes and discernes good and bad, things to be done, and things to be left vndone. Now man can∣not haue this gift to discerne between good and euill, of, or from himselfe: but it must needes proceede from another cause, which is power, wisedome, and vnderstanding it selfe, and that is God. Againe, the conscience, another gift of the soule of man, hath in it two principall acti∣ons; testimony, and iudgement: by both which the trueth in hand is evidently confir∣med. Touching the testimonie of conscience: let it be demaunded of the Atheist, whereof doth conscience beare witnesse? he cannot denie, but of all his particular actions. I aske then, against whome, or with whome doth it giue testimony? the āswer wil easily be made, by the heart of any man, that it is with or a∣gainst himselfe. Furthermore, to whome is it a witnes? Neither to men, nor to angels: for it is vnpossible that any man or angel, should either heare the voice of cōsciēce, or receiue the testimonie thereof, or yet discerne what is in the heart of man. Hereupon it followes, that there is a substance, most wise, most powerfull, most holy, that sees and knowes all things, to whome conscience beares re∣cord, and that is God himselfe. And touching the iudgement of consci∣ence; let a man commit any trespasse or of∣fence,
though it be done in secret, and con∣cealed from the knowledge of any person liuing: yet Conscience, that knoweth it, will accuse him, terrifie him, cite him before God, and giue him no rest. What or where is the reason? man knowes not the trespasse committed: and if there be no God, whome shall he feare? and yet he feares. This also necessarily prooueth, that there is a iust and mightie God, that will take vengeance vpon him for his sinne. IV. The fourth argument from nature, is this: There is a ground or principle written in euery mans heart in the world, none ex∣cepted, that there is a God. Reasons for proofe hereof, may be these. First, the Gentiles worshipping Idoles, made of stocks and stones, doe acknowledge herein thus much, that there is something whereunto honour and seruice is due. For man by nature is proud, and will neuer yeeld to bow the knee of his bodie before a stocke or a stone to adore it, vnlesse he thinke and acknowledge that there is in them a diuine power, better then himselfe. Secondly, the oath that is taken for Con∣firmation, commonly tearmed the assertorie oath, is vsed in all countries. And it is, for the most part, generally taken to be a lawfull meanes of confirming a mans word, when it is bound by the oath taken. Iacob and Laban beeing to make a couenant, Iacob sweares
by the true God, Laban by his false gods, and by that both were bound to stand to their agreement, and not to goe backe: there∣fore neither of them did, or durst breake their oath. And among the Gentiles them∣selues there are fewe or none to be found, that will falsifie their word giuen and auow∣ed by oath. Whereupon it is a cleare case, that they acknowledged a Godhead, which knowes and discernes their hearts, yea that knowes the truth, and can and will plague them for disgracing the truth by ly∣ing. Thirdly, we are not lightly to passe ouer the vsuall tearmes and ordinarie speech of all nations, who are woont vpon occasion to say: it raines, it thunders, it snowes, it hailes. For, saying this, one while they re∣ioyce and are thankefull, otherwhiles they feare and are dismaied. They say not, na∣ture or heauen raines or thunders: for then they would neither reioyce nor tremble. In that therefore they speake this commonly sometimes reioycing, sometimes fearing, it may probably be thought, that they ac∣knowledge a diuine power, which causeth the raine to fall, and the thunder to be so terrible. Againe, for better proofe hereof, it is to be considered, that since the world began, there could not yet be found, or brought forth; any man that euer wrote, or publish∣ed
a discourse, more or lesse, to this pur∣pose, that there was no God. If it be said, that some histories doe make mention of sundrie, that haue in plaine tearmes denied there is a God, and that this is no lesse daungerous, then if a treatise of that subiect should be written, and set forth to the open view of all. I answer, indeede in the writings of men, we doe read of some that blasphemed God, and liued as without God, and they haue al∣waies beene properly and deseruedly tear∣med Atheists. Others haue denied, that made and faigned gods, that is, Idols, are gods. And amongst the heathen that liued onely by the light and direction of nature, all that can be brought is this, that some men in their writings haue doubted whe∣ther there were a God or no, but none did euer positiuely set downe reasons to prooue that there was none. V. The fifth and last argument from na∣ture, is that which is vsed by all Philoso∣phers. In the world there is to be seene an excellent wise frame and order of all things. One creature depends vpon an other by a certaine order of causes: in which, some are first and aboue in higher place, some are next and inferiour, some are the basest and the lowest. Now these lowest are mooued of those that are superiour to them, and alwaies the
superiour is the cause of the inferiour, and that whereof the inferiour depends. Some∣thing then there must be that is the cause of all causes, that must be caused by none, and must be the cause of all. For in things where∣in there is order, there is alway some first and soueraigne cause: and where there is no first nor last, there the Creatures are infinite. But seeing all creatures are finite, there must be somewhat first, as well as last. Now the first and the last cause of all is God, which mooueth all, and to whome all creatures doe tend, as to their ende, and which is mooued of none. Notwithstanding all these reasons groun∣ded in nature it selfe, it may be some man wil say, I neuer saw God, how then shall I know that there is a God? Ans. Why? wilt thou beleeue no more then thou seest? Thou ne∣uer sawest the winde, or the aire, and yet thou beleeuest that there is both. Nay, thou neuer sawest thine owne face but in a glasse, and neuer out of a glasse, and yet this conten∣teth thee. Why then may not this content thy heart, and resolue thee of the Godhead, in that thou seest him in the glasse of the creatures? True it is, that God is a spirit inuisible that cannot be discerned, by the eie of flesh and blood, yet he hath not left vs without a meanes, whereby we may behold him. For looke as we are woont by degrees to goe
from the picture to the painter, and in the picture to behold the painter himselfe: euen so by the image of God, written (as it were) in the face, and other parts of the creatures in the world, may we take a view of the wis∣dome, power, and prouidence of the Creator of them all, who is God himselfe. And these are the principall proofes of the Godhead, which are reuealed in the booke of nature. Sect. 2. The second ground of proofes, is taken from the light of grace. And it is that light Arguments fró the light of Grace. which God affordeth to his Church in the writings of the Prophets and Apostles, and this giues a further confirmation then nature doth. For the light of nature, is onely a way or preparation to faith. But this light serues to beget faith, and causeth vs to beleeue there is a God. Now in the scriptures of the Prophets and Apostles, we shall see amongst the rest three distinct proofes of this point. First, expresse testimonies that doe in plaine tearmes, note vnto vs the Godhead. Secondly, expresse prophecies and reue∣lations of things to come, euen many hun∣dred and thousands of yeares, before they came to passe. Yea things that are to come are foretold in the word of God, so and in that very manner, that they shall be in the
time, wherein they are to be fulfilled. Now there is no man able of himselfe to know or foresee these things to come; therefore this knowledge must rest in him alone, who is most wise, that perfectly vnderstandeth and beholdeth things that are not, and to whom all future things are present, and therefore certain. Thirdly, the word of God reuealeth ma∣ny miracles, which doe exceede and surpasse whole nature, yea all naturall causes: the do∣ing and working whereof, is not in the pow∣er of any meere creature in the world. As for example: the making of the sunne against his naturall course, to stand still in the firma∣ment; of the waters, which are naturally flowing, to stand as a wall, and the bottome of the sea to be as drie land. The maine ende whereof is, to shew that there is an absolute and almightie power: which is the author of nature it selfe, and all naturall things, and or∣dereth both it and them, according to his pleasure. Sect. 3. The third ground of proofes, is fetched Aments fó the light of Glorie. from the light of glorie. And this is that light which God affords vnto his seruants after this life ended, in the kingdome of hea∣uen, wherein all imperfection of knowledge being taken away, they shal see God face to face, and haue a full and perfect knowledge
of the Godhead. To this purpose the Apostle saith, that in the world we know in part, & we see as it were in a glasse. The cōparison is worth the marking. . Cor. 13. For there he compareth our knowledge of God, that we haue in this life, to a dimme sighted man, that can see either very little, or nothing at all, without his spectacles. And such is our sight & comprehension of God, darke and dimme, in that we cannot behold him as he is, but onely as he hath manifested himselfe vnto vs, in and through the glasse of the word and Sacraments, and by the spectacles of his creatures. But the time will come, when the skales of our eies shall be washed off, and they shall be made as cleare as cristall, when the imperfection and weak∣nes of our vnderstanding shall be cleane re∣mooued, and then we shall be inabled to see God clearely and fully face to face. Thus the first Question is answered, that there is a God.
II. Question. Whether Iesus the sonne of Mary, be the sonne of God, and Redeemer of the world? BY propounding this Question (as in the former) I meane not to make a doubt touching the godhead of Christ, which is one of the principall groundes of our religion, but to take away, or at least, preuent an in∣ward corruption of the heart in thē, that are weake in knowledge; whereby they may be brought sometimes to make doubt and que∣stion of the diuinitie of Christ, and therefore haue neede to be resolued in the truth here∣of. Now for the proofe of this point, that Christ is God, I will lay downe these grounds. I. The summe & substance of the Bible is to conclude, that Iesus the sonne of Mary, is the sonne of God, and the Redeemer of man∣kinde; and it may be concluded in this syllo∣gisme. He that shall come of the seede of Abraham and Dauid, and in time shall be borne of a Virgin; that shall preach the gladtidings of the Gospell, satisfie the law, offer vp an oblation of himselfe for the sinnes of them that beleeue: ouercome death by his death and resurrection, ascend into heauen, and in fulnesse of time come againe to iudge both the quicke and the dead, is the true
Messias and Sauiour of the world: But Iesus of Nazareth the sonne of Marie is he in whome alone all these things shall come to passe: Therfore he onely is the true Messias and Saui∣our of the world. The proposition or first part of the argu∣ment, is laid downe in the old Testament: the assumption or second part, in the New. The conclusion is the question in hand, the scope and drift of them both. II. Ground. In Daniel 9. 24. it was pro∣phecied, that after the time of 70. weekes, that is, 490. yeares, the Messias should be ex∣hibited. By which prophecie it is manifest, that the Messias is alreadie come into the world. For from that time till now, there are at the least 2000. yeares, as may plainly be seene by hu∣mane histories, and by the motions and course of the heauens. It is also plaine from hence, that hauing bene exhibited and come in the flesh, he hath made satisfaction by his death to the wrath of God for sinne. Hence it followes, that he is the very true Messias and Redeemer of the world, because from that time there was neuer any to whome this title, and the forenamed properties, might so truly agree, as to this Iesus the sonne of Dauid. III. Ground. Iesus the sonne of Mary did teach, professe, and dispute, that he was God,
that he and his father were one, and he tooke vnto himselfe the honour of God, Ioh. 7. and 8. An evident argument that he was so, as he professed and preached himselfe to be. For neuer any creature chalenged to himselfe the honour of God falsly, but was discouered and confounded. Adam for affecting and aspiring to it, was cast out of Paradise. And Herod for it died miserably, Act. 12. And diuers Popes are re∣corded in Ecclesiasticall stories, to haue ta∣ken this honour vnto themselues: and there was neuer any sort of men in the world, that had more fearfull iudgments vpon them, then they. But Christ chalenged this to him∣selfe, and prospered: and God did most se∣uerely reuenge his death both vpon Herod and Pilate, as also vpon the Iewes, and Em∣perours of Rome, that persecuted the Church. IV. Ground. Christ while he was on earth, before he ascended into heauen, promised his Disciples to send his spirit vnto them, so to assist them, that they should be able to do greater works, then himselfe did, Ioh. 14. 12. &c. Now whē Christ was ascended, the euent was strange, and yet fully answerable to his promise. For the disciples were but fewe, twelue in number, and all vnlearned, and yet they preached in the name of Christ, and by bare preaching (without humane eloquence, and the giftes of nature) conuerted many
nations, yea, the whole world. And though themselues were but weake men, and preach∣ed things absurd to the corrupt reason of man: yet they wonne many soules to God, and conuerted the world. V. Ground, is borrowed from the testi∣mony of the Heathen, who haue recorded in their writings, the very samethings touching Christ which are reuealed in the scriptures. Iosephus a Iew, and an enemie to Christ, in his eight booke of antiquities, Chap. 4. speakes the same things of Christ, that Mathew doth, that he was a most worthy man, that he wrought many miracles, and that he rose from the dead. Others affirme, that he was crucified vnder Pilate in the time of Tiberius, and that Tiberius would haue put him in the number of his gods. Againe, heathen writers Tacit. lib. 5. 20. report, that at his death, vnder the raigne of Tiberius, all the oracles of the world ceased, Plutarch. de rit. ac. and the great god Pan (as they say) then di∣ed.
CHAP. III. Of the Scriptures. The second maine question, is touching the truth of scripture, Whether the scriptures be the true word of God? THe answere is, that they are. And the grounds of this asser∣tion, may be reduced to sixe heades. Sect. 1. The first, is taken from the causes, namely, the author and writers of the scriptures. Touching the Author, the scripture refer∣reth The Authors and penmen of Scripture. it selfe vnto God. Therfore he alone is the true and vndoubted author thereof, and none but he. The sufficiencie of this conse∣quence, stands vpon these grounds. First, if god were not the author of scrip∣tures, there would be no one booke in the earth so fabulous and so full of errour as it, which to say, is blasphemy. For it speakes such things, as neuer any could speake, but God. Secondly, if it were not the booke of God, then all Gods will should be hidden,
and God should neuer yet haue reuealed his will to man. Thirdly, if it had not beene the word of God, the falshood therof would haue beene detected long agone. For there hath beene nothing falsly said of God at any time, which he himselfe hath not at some time or other, opened and reuealed. Euen as he did detect and discouer the falshood of the false pro∣phet Hanan Ier. 28. 16. and Gods heauie hand, no doubt; would long since haue beene vpon the Ministers and preachers of this word, if they had vniustly and wrongfully fathered it vpon him. Againe, for the writers and penmen of scripture, Moses, the Prophets, and Apostles in their writings, doe not set forth their own glory, nobility, or vertues: but all with one consent, haue acknowledged directly and plainely their owne errors, and faults; yea such faults as may be disgracefull to them∣selues, and their posteritie, and yet they haue done it. A plaine proofe, that they were not carried by policie, and naturall reason, but were holy men, guided by the Holy Ghost. For if they had beene guided by reason, they would neuer haue written that, which would haue tended to their owne disgrace: but would rather haue comended thēselues, their name, stocke, and linage. Againe, humane au∣thors in their discourses, doe commonly write of the praises and vertues of men, of
whome they write. But the penmen of scrip∣ture, with one consent, giue all to God; yea, when they speake of commendation due to men, thy giue it all to God in men. God is in their writings, the beginning, the ende, & all. Sect. 2. A second head of reasons, is taken from The Matter of Scripture. the Matter, and Contents of the Scriptures, which are manifold. The principall are these. First, the Scripture doth that, which no o∣ther bookes can doe. For it sets out the cor∣ruption of mans nature by sinne; the foun∣taine of this corruption; & the punishment of the same, both in this life, and the life to come: it discouereth sinnefull mans parti∣cular thoughts, lusts, and affections, which neuer any book hath don beside it. No Philo∣sopher was euer able to make so true record, and so plaine declaration of the thoughts, motions, and affections of the heart. The rea∣son of man cannot discerne them by nature, vnles it receiue a further light by grace, then it hath naturally in it selfe. Yea the Scripture sets downe things, that no mans heart can i∣magine, & yet are true by experiēce. For ex∣ample: that it is an euill thought to thinke there is no God, mā by nature cānot imagine, but yet it is true in experience, & by the light of the word. And therefore Dauid saith, The Psal. 14. foole hath saide in his heart, there is no God. Secondly, the maine Contents of this
booke, are sundrie articles of faith, all which are farre aboue the reach of humane reason, and yet they are not against it; but at least some of them may be prooued by it. For example, that there is a Redeemer of the world, is an article of faith, aboue reason: yet not against the same. For in naturall vn∣derstanding, God is not all iustice, and no mercie. But if there were no redeemer, then should God be all iustice, without mercie. Now because he hath reuealed himselfe to be as well mercifull, as he is iust, reason con∣cludes, there is a redeemer. Againe, that this Redeemer should be God and man, is aboue reason; yet not against it. For reason teacheth, he must be God, that he might satisfie the in∣finite iustice of God for sinne; which none but God can doe. Againe, that he must be man, because man hauing sinned, man must be punished for the sinne of man. Thirdly, in the scripture there are sundrie predictions made before hand particularly, which notwithstanding were not to come to passe till an 100, 200, 300 yeares after, & all these predictions in the same manner as they haue bin foretold, haue bin fulfilled. Iacob in his will foretold, that the scepter should not depart from Iudah till Shiloh, that is, the Messias came. This was verified, euen as it was foretold. For a little before Christs birth, the scepter was taken from the Iewes, and translated vnto the Romane Empire.
And Herod put the whole colledge of the Iewes, called their Sanedrim, to the sword, in which colledge was the heire apparent of the Kings blood. Againe, Balaam Num. 24. 24. foretold that Kittim, that is, the Grecians and the Romans, should subdue Eber, the people of the East, and that also was afterward verified. For the Hebrewes and Assyrians, were afterward o∣uercome by the Grecians, and Cilicians. The Apostle Paul in his time foretold the destruction of the Romane Empire, and the reuealing of Antichrist, 2. Thes. 7, 8. &c. which prophecie was shortly after fulfilled. For An∣tichrist grew from those times by little and little, till at length he came to sit in the Em∣perours throne. Men indeede may foretell things to come, but things foretold by them are present in their causes, and so they know and foretell them, not otherwise. But God foretelleth simply, and the scriptures foretell simply, therefore they are the word of God. Fourthly, the law, a part of the scripture, is propounded most purely & perfectly with∣out exception or limitation. Whereas, in all mens lawes some sinnes are condemned, but some be tolerated and permitted. But in Gods law euery sinne is condemned, & none either forborne or excused. Lastly, the style and speech of the Scrip∣ture is plaine and simple without affectation, and yet full of grace and maiestie. For in that
simple style, it commandeth the whole man, bodie and soule; it threatneth euerlasting death, and promiseth euerlasting life: and it doth more affect the heart of man, then all the writings in the world whatsoeuer. Sect. 3. The third reason to induce vs to receiue the scriptures, as the word of God, is taken Effects of Scripture. from the Effects: whereof I note onely two. I. The doctrine of Scripture in the Law, and specially in the Gospel, is contrarie to the corrupt nature of man. Whereupon Paul saith, The wisdome of the flesh, is enmitie against . 8. . God. And yet the same word, beeing preach∣ed by the Minister appointed by God, con∣ueteth nature, and turnes the heart of man vnto it, in such sort, as in this last age it hath wonne a great part of the world, to the im∣bracing thereof. Now in reason this is im∣possible, that a thing which is so flat against mans corrupt nature, should notwithstāding preuaile with it so farre, as to cause man to liue and die in the profession & maintenance thereof. Wee are woont to reiect the wri∣tings of men, if they please not our humors; whereas this word of God, is of force to mooue and cline our affections, though neuer so much censured, crossed, and control∣led by it. And this shewes that God is the author thereof, from whome the word of creation came, to which euery thing at the
first yeelded obedience. II. The word of God hath this effect, to be able to minister comfort and releefe, in all distresses of bodie or minde, yea in the greatest and most desperate troubles, and vexations of the Conscience. And when the helpes of humane learning and Philosophie (which are of great vse and force in other cases) haue done all that they can, to the ve∣ry vtmost, without effect or successe: euen then the sweete promises of the Gospel, will reuiue and raise vp the heart, and giue it full contentment and satisfaction. Expetience shewes this to be a confessed truth in parti∣cular cases: and it teacheth, whence and frō whome this word proceedeth, wherein these promises are contained, namely, from God. For when he sets the Conscience vpon the racke, the Word that releeueth and refresh∣eth the same, must needs proceede and come from him alone. Sect. 4. The fourth reason, is taken from the Pro∣perties Properties of Scripture. of Scripture. I will name onely two. The first, is Antiquitie, which most plainly appeares in the historie, though the doctrine it selfe be as ancient. The Scripture contains a continued historie, from age to age, for the space of 4000 yeares before Christ, euen from the beginning. Humane histories, that are of any certentie or continuance, begin
onely about the time of Ezra, and Nehemi∣ah. As for those which were written before, they are onely fragments, and of no cer∣tentie. The second propertie, is Consent with it selfe, in all parts, both for the matter, scope, and ende. The writings of men doe dissent from themselues, by reason of ignorance, & forgetfulnes in the authors. But the word of God, agrees with it selfe most exactly, and the places that seeme to disagree, may easily be reconciled; which shewes that ho∣ly men, by whome it was penned, were not guided therein by their owne priuate iudge∣ment, but were directed by the wisdome of the spirit of God. Sect. 5. The fift reason, is drawne from the Con∣traries. The Deuill and wicked men, are in Contraies. iudgement and disposition, as contrarie to scripture, as light is to darkenes. I prooue it thus. Let a man read any booke of Philoso∣phie, and labour to be resolued of any one point therein, he shall neuer be tempted to infidelitie. But if the same man, reade the bookes of Scripture, and labour to vnder∣stand them; he shall haue within himselfe, many motions and temptations, not to be∣leeue, and obey it. Now what should be the cause thereof, but that these bookes are the word of God, which the Deuill laboureth to
oppugne with might and maine? Againe, consider the same in the practise of wicked men. They will not brooke the rebuke of their sinnes, namely, their Idola∣trie, blasphemie, and other notorious crimes, by scripture; but will seeke the blood and life of him, that shall sharply taxe, and re∣prooue them. And hence it was, that wicked Kings so persecuted the Lords Prophets. Yea further, let it be marked, that these wic∣ked men, that are tainted with these horrible crimes, and cannot abide the word, nor tea∣chers thereof to the death, haue commonly fearefull endes. Now the opposition of Sa∣tan, and wicked men to the word shewes the scriptures to be a most holy word, and in∣deede the very word of God. Sect. 6. The sixt reason, is taken from sundrie Testimonies. testimonies. First, of holy Martyrs, in the Olde and New testament, who haue giuen their liues for the maintenance of this word, and sea∣led the same with their owne hearts blood; yea suffered the most horrible and exquisite torments, that the wit of man could deuise, and that most patiently and willingly, not beeing daunted or dismaied. The stories of Martyrs in all ages, confirme this truth, espe∣cially of those that suffered before, in, and af∣ter the times of the tenne bloodie persecuti∣ons.
And. vnlesse they had beene suppor∣ted by a dine power, in so good a cause, they could neuer, so many of them, haue suf∣fered in such manner, as they did. The second, is the testimonie and consent of Heathen men, who haue recorded the ve∣ry same things, at last many of the princi∣pall, that are set downe in the Bible. If this were not so, man should haue some coloura∣ble excuse of his vnbeleefe. And these things which they record, were not all taken out of the Scripture, but were registred to memorie by Historiographers, that liued in the times, when they were done. Such are the stories of the Creation, and Flood, of the tower of Ba∣bel, of the Arke, of Abraham and his possessi∣ons, of Circumcision, of the miracles of Moses, of the birth of Christ, and the slaugh∣ter of the young children, of the miracles of Christ, of the death of Herod, Agrippa, and such like. And these we take for true in hu∣mane stories: much more then ought we to doe it in the word of God. The third testimonie, is of Miracles. The octrine of scripture was confirmed by mira∣cles, wrought by the teachers thereof, the Prophets and Apostles, aboue all power & strength of nature, and such as the Deuill can not counterfeit; as the staying of the sunne, and the raising of the dead, &c. The fourth, is the testimonie of the Holy Ghost, which is the argument of all argu∣ments,
to settle and resolue the Conscience, and to seale vp the certaintie of the word of God. If any shall aske, how this testimony of the Holy Ghost may be obtained, and bee∣ing obtained, how we may discerne it to be the testimony of the Holy Ghost, and not of man: I answer, by doing two things. First, by resigning our selues to become truly obedient to the doctrine taught. Ioh. 7. 17. If any man will doe my fathers will, (saith Christ) he shall know of the doctrine whether it be of God. Secondly, by praying vnto God for his Spirit, to certifie our consciences, that the doctrine reveiled, is the doctrine of God. Aske (faith our Sauiour Christ) & it shal be gi∣uen you seeke, and ye shall find: knock, and it shall be opened vnto you. For he that asketh, receeth. Mat. 7. 7, 8. Againe, Your heauenly father will giue the Holy Ghost; to them that desire him, Luc. 11. 13. And, If any man lacke wisdome, let him aske it of God, who giueth to all men liberally, and reprocheth no man, and it shall be giuen him. Iam. 1. 7. Sect. 7. Now hauing set down the proofes of this Obiections a∣gainst the Scriptures. point, before I come to the next Question, some speciall Obiections against this do∣ctrine, are to be answered, and resolued. For there haue not beene wanting in all ages, both Atheists, and others, who haue profes∣sedly
excepted against it, and of set purpose, haue vndertaken to call the written word of God into Question. Such were Celsus, Luci∣an, Iulian, Porpherie, Apelles, and others. From whome some of latter times hauing receiued the poison of Atheisme, and prophanesse, haue not ceased as much as in them lyeth, to oppugne sundry parts and portions of holy scripture. Their principall reasons and excep∣tions, I will propound, and answere one by one. And first, they except against that which is written, Gen. 1. 16. where it is said, God Obiect. 1. made the sunne the fourth day. Now, say they, the sunne is the cause of the day; and there∣fore there could not be three daies, before the sunne was created, considering that the effect is not before the cause, but the cause before the effect. I answere. First, we must put a difference betweene cause and cause. For of causes, some be the highest, some subordinate vnto them. The highest and first cause, of all crea∣tures, is God himselfe, from whom all things at the first immediately flowed, without any relation to their causes in nature. And thus were the first, second, and third daies created and appointed immediately from God, and distinguished from the night, by an inter∣course of light, ordained by him for that purpose. But the subordinate and inferior cause of
the day, in order of nature, was the sunne, and that by the same appointment of God: and this cause was not set in nature, as the cause of the day, before the fourth day of creation; for then it pleased him to make it his instru∣ment, to distinguish the day from the night, as also for other ends and vses. And therfore it is no marueile, though the day was created before the sunne, the instrumentall cause thereof: considering that it was created be∣fore the sunne was set in the heauen, by the Creatour himselfe. Secondly, we must distinguish of times: which are either of creation, or gouernment: and there is one regard to be had of things while they were in making, and another after they were created. Now it is true, the sunne is the cause of the day and the night, in the time of the gouernment of the world, but it was not so in the time of the first making of all things. For in the three first daies of the world, there was day and night without the sunne, by a viciitude of light and darkenes, which the Lord made, and nature could ne∣uer haue found out, had not the word reuea∣led it. But since the creation, in the time of go∣uernment, the sunne is but an instrument ap∣pointed by God to cary light, and he that made the light, can now in the gouernment of the world, if it pleased him, put downe the sunne from this office, and by some other
meanes distinguish the day from the night; therefore no marueile though he did so in the beginning. The second Obiection, is touching the light of the Moone. Moses saith, it is one of Obiect. 2. the great lights which God made. Now, say they, in all reason according to humane lear∣ning, it is one of the least of the planets, and lesse then many starres. Answ. It is true which the holy Ghost saith by Moses, and yet the Moone is lesse then the Sunne, yea then many of the starres. For one and the same starre, in a diuers and diffe∣rent respect, may be tearmed greater and lesser. And in that place the Scripture speaks of the Moone, not in regard of other starres greater then it: but in respect of our sese, because it appeareth greater in quantitie, and really communicateth more light; yea, it is of more operation and vse to the earth, then any of the starres in the heauen, sauing the Sunne. The third Obiection Moses saith, Man & Obiect. 3. Beast were made of the earth, and Fishes of the waters. But all humane learning auouch∣eth, that the matter of euery creature, consi∣steth of all the foure Elements, earth, water, fire, and re. Ans. Moses speaketh onely of two, which were the principall, and in them includes the other; because they are impure, & mixt with the other since the fall. Againe, some learned
auouch, that all creatures are made of earth & water only, as being the two maine mate∣riall principles of the all; and not of ayre, nor of fire. And this accords with Moses, and is no doubt, a truth, that he speaks onely of the principall matter of these creatures: & yet the fire and ayre, are and may be called ele∣ments, or beginnings, because they serue to forme, preserue, and cherish the creatures. The fourth Obiection. Gen. 3. it is said, that Obiect. . Eue before her fall, was deceiued by the Ser∣pent. Now this, saith the Atheist, is absurd. For euen in the estate of corruption, since the fall, there is no woman so simple, that will ei∣ther admit speech, or suffer her selfe to be deceiued by a Serpent; much lesse would Eue, in the estate of her innocencie. Answ. Though Adam and Eue in their in∣nocencie, had excellent knowledge, yet they had not all knowledge. For then they should haue beene as God himselfe. But in that e∣state, ignorance befell Eve in three things. For first, though Adam himselfe was a Pro∣phet, in the time of his innocencie, yet both he and shee were ignorant of the issue of future things, which are contingent. Second∣ly, they knewe not the secrets of each others heart. For to know the euent of things con∣tingent certainely, and the secrets of the heart, belongs to God only. Thirdly, though Eue knew the kinds of creatures, yet shee knew not all particulars, and all things that
were incident to euery kind of creature, but was to attain vnto that knowledge, by expe∣rience and obseruation. Neither may this seeme strange: for Christ as he was man, had as much, yea more knowledge then our first parents had in their innocency: and yet he knew not all particu∣lars, in all singular creatures. For, seeing a fig∣tree by the way as he went to Ierusalem, he thought it had borne fruit, and yet comming towards it, he found none thereon. And in like manner, Eue might know the serpentine kind, and yet be ignorant, whether a serpent could speake. Besides that, the naming of the creatures, which argues knowledge of them, was not giuen to Eue, but to Adam. And therefore it was not so strange, that Eue should be deceiued by a serpent, considering that to know that a serpent could speake, or not speake, came by experience, which shee then had not. I will be said, that all ignorance is sinne: but Eue had no sinne: and therefore shee could not be ignorant. Answ. Ignorance is twofold; some ignorance Ignorantia pravae disposi∣tionis. ariseth of an euill disposition, when as we are ignorant of those things which we are bound to knowe, and this is sinne properly. But there is another ignorance, Ignorantia  privati∣onis vel nega∣tionis p. which is no sinne, when as we are ignorant of those things, which we are not bound to know. And this was in Christ: for he was ignorant of the figtrees bearing
fruit: and he knew not the day of iudgement as he was man. And this also was in Eue, not the other. The fift obiection; is about the Arke, Gen. Obiect. 5. 6. 15. God commaunded Noah to make an Arke of 300 cubits long, of 50 cubits broad and of 30 cubits high. This Arke, saith the Atheist, beeing so small a vessell, could not possibly containe two of euery sort of crea∣tures, with their foode, for the space of a yeare. The first author of this cauill, was Apelles the hereticke, that cauilled with Christians about the Arke. And the answer is as ancient as the heresie: namely, first, that the cubit of the arke must be vnderstood of the Egypti∣an cubit, which is with some, sixe foote, and with others, nine foote, by which measure the Arke would be in lēgth half a mile at the least. And by this means, any man may see a possibility in reason, that the Arke might containe, and preserue all creatures, with their fodder, and roome to spare. The second answere is, that as the Iewes had a shekle of the sanctuary, which was greater then the ordinary shekle, so they had beside the ordinary cubit, a sacred cubit, the cubit of the sanctuary, where of mention is made in the prophecie of Ezekiel, Chap. 40. and that was bigger by the halfe, then the ordinarie cubite. And by this measure, some say, the Arke was made. But both these
answeres are onely coniecturall, without good ground in the scripture. To them therefore I adde a third. In the daies of Noah, the stature of man was farre bigger then it is at this day. And looke as the stature of man was great and large, so was the cubite proportionall therto; contai∣ning the length of the arme, from the elbow to the longest fingers end. And this beeing considered, that the Arke was built by that measure, and not by the ordinary cubit, as it is now; it will appeare, that the Atheist hath greatly deceiued himselfe, and abused that part of Gods word that declares the storie of the Arke. Againe, the length of this vessell, beeing 300. cubits, it is plaine that it was fiue times the length of Salomons temple, which con∣tained onely 60. cubits. The breadth beeing 58. it was twise and a halfe the breadth of that, which was but 20. broad. Besides that, it is to be remembred, that in the Arke were three lofts or stories, one a∣boue another, whereof each contained 10. cubits in height, and a chamber or flore of square measure, 15000. cubits. As for the creatures that were put into it: the Fowles of the ayre, though they were of many sorts, yet the biggest fort of them, beeing the Eagle and his kind, they could not take vp any very large place for their resi∣dence. The Water creatures, as some foules,
the fishes, &c. kept the waters, and were not lodged in the Arke. And the beasts of the earth, such beeing excluded, as were bredde either by accidentall generation, as Mules; or by putrefaction, as serpents, and other creeping things, which might afterward be restored in other creatures that were prefer∣ued, though for multitude and greatnes they excelled the rest, yet (as some write) there are of them in all not aboue an 150 distinct kinds. And though there were as many more not knowne, yet in probabilitie, they could not be either many, or great. And of those that are great, there are thought not to be a∣boue 40 kinds. Now though it be graunted, that there were in the Arke 300 distinct kinds of beasts, yet this number compared with the roome, it will easily appeare, that there might be al∣lotted to euery kinde, in one onely storie 50 square cubits, which in all likelihood might well suffice them all one with an other, spe∣cially seeing all were not of an equall great∣nes: and therefore some might haue that or more space, and some lesse. All these things duly considered, the vessell beeing of such capacitie, might cōprehend all those beasts, and many more together with their prouisi∣on for a longer time then a yeare. Other doubts touching this historie, of lesse mo∣ment, I omit, and passe to the next. The sixt allegation, is out of Gen. 21. 9. Obiect. .
where Ismael is said to mocke at Isaak when he was wained, at which time Ismael was fifteene yeares of age at the least. For he was borne when Abraham was 86 yeare olde, Gen. 16. and Isaac was borne, when Abra∣ham was about a hundred, Gen. 21. 5. both which put together, make 14 yeares: where∣to one yeare beeing added, before Isaac was wained, makes vp the age of Ismael, as be∣fore. And yet afterward in that chapter, v. 14. Hagar is saide, to carrie the child in her armes, and to cast him vnder a tree, when he and his mother were cast out of Abrahams house, which argues him to haue beene but a little child: whereas before he was said to be 15 yeares olde. Ans. A foolish cauill, which blind Atheists doe draw from the errour of some translati∣on. For the text is plaine, that Ismael with his mother Hagar, by reason of extreame heate, and drought, was almost dead, wande∣ring in the wildernes of Beersheba: and bee∣ing in this extremitie, shee caried him not, but v. 18. led him in her hand, and set him downe vnder a tree, and there left him to die. For in those cuntries, men for want of water, were at deaths dore: as we may see in the example of Sisera, Iudg. 4. 19. and Samp∣son, chap. 15. 18. The seauenth Allegation. Gen. 43. 8. Iudah Iosephs brother, calls his brother Beniamin Obiect. 7. a lad, or a boy, Send the boy with me, &c. and
yet this lad (saith the Atheist) the yeare fol∣lowing, when he wēt down into Egypt, with Iacob his father, is saide to haue ten childrē Gen. 46. 21. How can these two stand toge∣ther? Ans. This cauili aiseth from the grosse ignorance of the Atheist, in the originall text. For Beniamin is called jeled, which word commonly signifies a child; but some∣times also a young man. Thus Ismael that was 15 yeares old, is called jeled, a lad, Gen. 20. 15. And so Gen. 4. 23. Lamech saith, I will stay a man in my wound, and [jeled] or a young man in my hurt: that is, If a man should wound me, and a young man hurt me, I would slay him. Now it is not like, that a child could hurt Laniech. Neither must this seeme strange: for the most valiant men that Dauid and Ishbosheth had, are called hanne∣gnaim, the boyes of Abner & Ioab, . Sam. 2. 14. And the like phrase is vsed in other languages. For the Grecians doe call young men by the name of [,] and the Latines by the name of [pueri.] boyes, or children. The eight Allegation. Exod. 7. it is saide Obiect. 8. v. 19. that all the waters in Egypt were tur∣ned into blood, by Moses and Aaron: and yet v. 22. it is saide, that the Magitians of E∣gypt turned water into blood also: which seemes to imply an absurditie, considering that all the waters were turned into blood before.
Ans. Some answer thus: that the water which the Magitians turned, was newly dig∣ged out of new pits, and therefore they vn∣derstand the former of all the waters that were seene, and that they onely were turned into blood. Others answer more fitly, that the waters which the Magitians changed, were fetched out of Goshen, from amongst the Israelites, where the waters remained pure, and were not turned, as the other were. Either of these answers may satisfie, but specially the latter. The inth Allegation. Exod. 9. 6. Moses saith, that all the beasts in Egypt died of the Obiect 9. mu, and yet v. 25. in the seventh plague, it is said, the beasts were killed with thunder, and haile, and lightening: both which can∣not be true. Ans. First, we must put a difference be∣tween a common plague, or iudgement; and an vniuersall. A common plague is, wheno sort or kinde sapeth, but all sorts are smit∣ten, and such was the murren. For no mans cattell were free, no kind of cattell were sa∣ued. But the vniuersall is, when no particular of any kinde is exempted, but all destroied. Such was not this plague, but some escaped, and were reserued for other iudgements that followed. The ground of this distincti∣on, is this: The word [all] in Scripture is of∣ten taken indefinitely for many. Thus the Prophet Esay speaks, cap. 66. 23. From moneth
to moneth, and from Saboth to Saboth, shall all flesh come to worship before me: that is, many or great multitudes. And so in the new Testa∣ment, Matth. 4. 23. Christ healed all diseases, that is, many and of all kinds some. And in like manner the text before alleadged, must not be taken generally to include all with∣out exception, but indefinitely for many or the most part of the cattell that were in the land of Egypt. The tenth Allegation. Exod. 10. 22. wee Obiect. 10. read that one of the plagues was a palpable darknes, and so great, that for three daies to∣gether, no man either saw an other, or rose vp from the place where he sate. And yet v. 23. Moses is sent for, and called to come be∣fore Pharaoh. How should this be, seeing no man could stirre from his place, nor haue any light to goe before him: for there was none to be had, the darkenes was so palpable, and the aire was so thicke. Ans. I take it the word [Then] v. 24. is to be meant thus, that Pharaoh sent for Moses after the darkenes was ended, not by candle or or other light in the time of darkenes. And this answer may very well stand with∣out further exception. The eleuenth Allegation. Iudg. 16. 29. The Obiect. 11. Atheists make a mocke at the historie of Sampson, as fabulous, where it is said, that all the Philistims came together in one house, to make sport with him, and on the roofe
sate about 3000 persons to beholde him while he plaied, and yet there were but two pillars whereupon the whole house stood, and those also standing in the midst so neere together that a man might reach them both with his armes. This, say they, is most absurd and impossible. Ans. Although the full resolution of this cauill, belongs to them that haue skill in Ar∣chitecture; yet thus much may be faide in way of answer: That the house might be capable of so many persons, and they also that stood aboue might well see and behold Sampson. For first, the whole house was not sustained by two pillars onely, but by many more, whereof two were the principall. For in likelihood the middle part whereon the whole building was knit together, from the bottome to the toppe, beeing the weightiest of all, was supported by two master-pillars. The other which was more outward, and lesse weightie might be vpholden by lesser proppes, which Artificers in that kinde call by the name of false-pillars. Hence it appea∣reth, that the two maine ones standing so nigh together, beeing shaken, the whole Ioseph. Antiq. Iudaic. . 5. c. 10. fin. house together with them must needes fall. Neither will this seeme strange, that two pil∣lars should beare vp a building of such ca∣pacitie; if we doe but consider what is re∣corded of Curio the Romance, who deuised Plin. nat. hist. lib. 36. c. 5. the frame of a great Amphitheater, the two
parts whereof were supported onely by two hinges, and yet was so large, that it contai∣ned the whole people of Rome. Secondly, old buildings in those countries were made for the most part, with open roofe. Againe, they were full of windowes on euery part like vnto great gates: and that they might be the more fit for sight from aboue, they were reared vp in some sort after the manner of the Egyptian Pyramides, wider below, and narrower aboue towardes the top. And by this meanes it is probable, not onely that they might containe a great companie, but that all those which stoode about the sides, and vpon the roofe, might very well behold what Sampson did below; specially consi∣dering that he stood in the middest of the Theater, betweene the two middle pil∣lars. The twelfth Allegation. Sam. 16. 19. &c. it Obiect. 12. is saide that Dauid plaied before Saul, and that Saul knew him. But chap. 17. 55. when he was to fight with Goliah, Saul knew him not. Here is a plaine contradiction in the A∣theists iudgement. Ans. This sort of men doe still bewray their grosse ignorance, both in the matter and in the order of Scripture. For the word of God doth not alway set downe things, as they follow in order of time iust one after an other: but sometime it doth anticipate, put∣ting such things in former histories, as are al∣readie
done and accomplished, which in re∣gard of their euent should be related after∣ward. Sometime againe it vseth by recapitu∣lation to declare things as following in or∣der of time, which doe properly belong to a former narration. An example of the latter (to omit many other that might be brought) is the text alleadged. For that part of the 16 chap. from the 19v. to the ende, should by order of historie follow the 17, as will easily appeare by comparing the place. And the like displacing of things saide and done is else-where to be found in the Scriptures. Which beeing considered, the Atheists sup∣posed Contradiction, falls to the ground. For Dauid was to fight with Goliah before he plaied before Saul, and though he was then not knowne, yet Saul after that time tooke better knowledge of him. The thirteenth Allegation is out of 2. Chron. 21. 2. where the Papist plaies the Obiect. 3. right Atheist, in going about to improoue the originall copies. There (saith he) Iehosa∣phat is called king of Israel, when as indeede he was king of Iudah, and so is he called in the former booke of Chronicles. In like manner Ahaz is tearmed king of Israel, 2. Chron. 28. 19. whereas the truth is, he was king of Iudah. Answ. After the death of Salomon the kingdome was deuided, and the ten tribes were called Israel, and the other two Iudah
and Beniamin did beare the name of Iudah. Now after the diuision, for some time the name of Israel common to both sides, was giuen to either, and both were named after it. And in this respect Iehoshaphat and Ahaz may be termed kings of Israel. A∣gaine, the name of Israel sundry times in Scripture, and namely in the prophets, is ta∣ken only for the two Tribes, which bare the name of Iudah after the defection. And thus also might Ahaz haue that name given vnto him, though he were king of Iudah. Further∣more, the word Israel, is sometimes put for a true worshipper of God, that is, for him that is a Iew not without but within, not in the letter, but in the spirit, Rom. 2. 29. Thus our Sauiour saith of Nathaniel, Ioh. 1. 48. Behold a true Israelite in whome is no guile, that is, a man of an vpright hart, that serueth God in spirit and in truth. And in this sense Iehoshaphat might be termed king of Israel, because he was a king and patrone of all true worshippers of God. For euen then the Israe∣lites sorted themselues together, and the godly among them came to liue vnder him in Iudah, though the distinction of the king∣domes did still remaine. The fourteenth Allegation is out of Act. Obiect 1. 7. 16. where the Papists and Atheists al∣leadge the Scripture to be contrary to it self: in that there it saith, Abraham bought a field of Emor, when as Gen. 33. 19. the same
field was bought by Iacob. Ans. 1. Some say that there is a fault, be∣cause Abrahams name is put for Iacob. Yet not a fault of the Bible, but of them that wrote out the Bible. Neither doth this diminish the authoritie of scripture, though the penmen did erre and slippe in writing, so long as we may find out the truth by scrip∣ture. 2. Ans. That this field was bought twice: First by Abraham, and then afterward reco∣uered by Iacob, that he might maintaine his fathers possession. 3. Answ. That Abrahams name is here put for his posterity, as Israels name is other∣where giuen to his children, yea not only to his children, but also to his fathers Isaack, & and Abraham. For Exod. 12. 40. it is said, The abode of the children of Israel while they dwelt in Egypt, was 430. yeares, which cannot be true vnlesse the abode of Abraham and Isaack be therein included. Now if the name of the successour may be giuen to his aunce∣stors, much more may the name of the aun∣cestors be giuen to the posteritie.
CHAP. IV. Of Religion. THe third Question concer∣ning man, as he stands in re∣lation to God, is touching Re∣ligion, where it is demanded, What is that Reli∣gion, that is due vnto the true God? Answ. The name Religion, is not alwaies taken in one and the same sense. For some∣time it is vsed, to signifie the whole bodie of doctrine, reuealed in the written word, that teacheth and prescribeth, whatsoeuer is to be beleeued or practized, as necessary to sal∣uation. Otherwhiles it is put for the inward vertue of the mind, where the same do∣ctirne is beleeued, and the duties therein required, practised, and performed to the Maiestie of God. And beeing thus taken, it is called by the name of Pietie or Godlinesse, in the Scripture. And in this second sense I take it in this place. Now Religion or Pietie, hath two distinct parts. The first, is knowledge of God; the se∣cond, the worship of God. These two are no∣tably
described by Dauid, in his last will and Testament, wherein he commends vnto Sa∣lomon his sonne before all other things, the care and ioue of Religion and Pietie; the summe whereof, he reduceth to these heades; the knowledge of God, and worship of God. 1. Chron. 28. 9. And thou Salomon my sonne KNOWE thou the God of thy father, and SERVE him with a perfect heart, and with a wil∣ling mind. According to this difference of heades, are the Questions concerning religion to be distinguished, and these are principally two. First, how God is to be knowne, and then how he is to be worshipped. I. Question. How God is to be concei∣ued in our mindes, when wee performe any seruice or wor∣ship vnto him? FOr answer hereunto, this ground is first to be laid, that we must not, neither can possibly knowe or conceiue God as he is in himselfe. For God in himselfe is infinite, and therefore incomprehensible in regard of vs. But we are to conceiue him so, as he hath & doth reveale himselfe to vs in his creatures, principally in his word. The truth herof may
appeare in this one example, (to alleadge no more) when Moses desired to see the glory & Maiestie of God, for a further confirmation and assurance of his calling, answer was made him by God, that he could not see his face, but he should see his back parts, as he passed by him. The meaning of this answer is, that God would manifest his glorie vnto him by his effects, by which as by a glympse or imperfect representation, he might discern some part of his Maiestie, so farre forth as he was able in the infirmitie of flesh and blood, to behold the same. But the perfect and full sight thereof, no creature was euer able to attain vnto, it beeing reserued for the life to come; when (& not before) they shall see him as he is in himselfe face to face. This Ground beeing laid, the full answer to the Question I propound in foure rules. I. Rule. When we are to pray, or to wor∣ship God, we must not conceiue him, in the forme of any earthly or heauenly, bodily, or spirituall creature whatsoeuer: for thus not to conceiue him, is a degree of conceiuing him aright. II. Rule. God must be conceiued of vs, not by his nature, but by his attributes, & works. By his attributes, as that he is infinite in mer∣cie, iustice, goodnes, power, &c. By his works of creation, and gouernement of the world, of redemption, &c. Thus the Lord reuealed himselfe to Moses, Exod. 6. 14. I AM hath
sent me vnto you: that is, one which hath his beeing in himselfe, and of himsefe, that giues being to all creatures by creation, and conti∣nues the same by his prouidence: one that giues a beeing and accomplishment, to all his mercifull promises. When the Lord ap∣peared to Moses, he shewed not his face vnto him, but passed by him with a voice, The Exod. 34. 6. Lord, the Lord, strong, mercifull, and gratious, long suffering, and plenteous in goodnes and truth. In which place, the Lord proclaimes his name, by his attributes. So in the prophecie of Ieremie, I am he that shewes mercie, iudge∣ment, Icr. 9. 24. and iustice in the land. The same, Daniel confesseth in his praier, when he saith, O Lord God, which art great and fearfull, keeping Dan. 9. 4. couenant and mercie toward thē that loue thee, & keepe thy commandements. And lastly, the au∣thor to the Hebrewes, He that comes to God, must beleeue that God is, and that he is a rewar∣der Heb. 11. 6. of them that seeke him. III. Rule. God must not be conceiued ab∣solutely, that is, out of the Trinitie: but as he subsisieth in the person of the Father, Sonne, and the Holy Ghost, so he must be knowne and conceiued of vs. The auncient rule of the Church is, that the vnitie must be worship∣ped in Trinitie, and the Trinitie in Vnitie. By this doe the protestant Churches, dif∣fer from all other assemblies of worshippers. The Turke conceiues and worships a God, creator of heauen and earth, but an abstra∣cted
God, which is neither Father, Sonne, nor Holy Ghost. The Iew worshippeth God, but out of Christ, and therefore a feigned and I∣dol God. The Papist in word acknowledgeth and so worshippeth God, but indeede makes God an Idol, because he worships him not in a true but in a feigned Christ, that sits at the right hand of the father in heauen, and is al∣so in the hands of euery Masse-priest, after the words of cōsecration. But the Protestant knowes God as he will be knowen, and con∣sequently worships him as he wilbe wor∣shipped, in Father, Sonne, and Holy Ghost. IV. Rule. When we direct our praiers, or any worship to any one person, we must in∣clude the rest in the same worship; yea fur∣ther, we must retaine in minde the distinction and order of all the three persons, without severing or sundring them; for so they are Matt. 28. 19. 1. Ioh. 5. 7. named, and propounded in the Scriptures. The reason is, because as they are not seue∣red, but conioyned in nature, so they neither are, nor must be seuered, but conioyned in worship. For example the man that praies, to God the Father for the forgiuenes of his sins, must aske it of him for the merit of the sonne, and by the assurance of the Holy Ghost. Againe, he that praies for remission of his sinnes, to God the Son, must pray that he would procure the Father to graunt his par∣don, and withall assure it by his spirit. He also that praies for the same to God the Holy
Ghost, must pray that he would assure vnto him the remission of his sinnes, from the fa∣ther, by, and for the merit of the Sonne. CHAP. V. Of the second part of Religion touching the worship of God, and first of the in∣ward worship. II. Question. How God is to be worshipped and serued. FOr the full answer hereof, we must remember that the wor∣ship of God is twofold; in∣ward or outward. Inward is the worship of the mind, the heart, the conscience, will, and affections; for man by all these ioyntly and seuerally performeth worship and seruice to his creator. The outward is that worshippe whereby the inward is testified outwardly in the speach and actions. The former of these two, is the spirituall worship of the inward man, and the very ground and foundation of all true worship of God: for God is a spi∣rit and therfore must be worshipped in spi∣rit, Ioh. 4. 24. that is, in the the minde, conscience, will, and affections. Indeede all the worshippe of
God is spirituall, euen that which we call outward; yet not of it selfe, but by vertue of the inward, from which it proceedeth. Sect. 1. The heades of Inward worship are two. Adoration. Adoration of God, and cleaving to God. For as they are two different actions of the heart, so they may fitly be termed two distinct parts of Gods worship. This distinction is in some part propounded by Moses, where he exhorteth the Israelites, to feare Iehovah their Deut. 10. 20. God, to adore him, to cleaue vnto him, and to swear by his name. Adoration, is that part of Gods worship, whereby a man, vpon a vile and base estima∣tion of himselfe, as beeing but dust and a∣shes, submits & subiects his soule to the glo∣rie and Maiestie of God. This hath two principal groundes in the heart, which if they be wanting, there can be no true worship of God. The first is Abnega∣tion or deniall of our selues, when we esteem our selues to be meerely nothing. The se∣cond is exaltation, or Advancemēt of Gods maiesty, aboue all the things in the world. Ex∣āples of these we haue many in the scriptures, as of Abraham, who called God his Lord, Gen. 8. 27. and himselfe dust and ashes: of the Angels, whome in a vision the Prophet sawe stan∣ding Esa. 6. , before God, with one wing couering their feete, which signified the abasing of
themselues; and with another couering their faces, which betokened their adoration of the maiestie of God. Of Daniel, when he confesseth, To thee, O Lord, belongeth righte∣ousnes Dan. 9. 7. it selfe, but to vs shame and confusion of face. Lastly, of the woman of Canaan, who calls Christ Lord, and her selfe, a dogge. Matth. 15. 27. Now in Adoration, there are foure Ver∣tues; Feare, Obedience, Patience, Thanke∣fulnesse. Feare, is a great part of the worship of God, which I prooue by two places laid to∣gether. Esa. 29. 13. Matth. 15. 8, 9. wherein Feare and Worship, are taken for one and the same thing: for that which Esay calls Feare, Matthew calls Worship. Now in this feare, there be two things that serue to di∣stinguish it from all other feares. First, it is absolute: for by it God is reue∣renced absolutely. Saint Paul exhorteth to yeelde tribute, feare, and honour to the Rom. 13. 7. Magistrate, not for himselfe, but for God, whose minister he is. And our Sauiour saith, Feare ye not them which kill the bodie, and are not Matth. 10. 28. able to kill the soule, but rather feare him which is able to destroy both soule and bodie in hell. As if he should say, I allow and command you to feare men, onely for God, who hath set them ouer you, but feare God for him∣selfe. Secondly, it makes a man, first of all, to feare the offence of God, and then the pu∣nishment
and iudgement. For it is not a feare of the offence alone, but of the offence and punishment together, and of the offence in the first place: Mal. 1. 6. If I be a Lord, where is my feare? And where it is saide in Matthew, but rather feare him that is able to cast bodie and Matth. 10. 28. soule into hell fire; there is commanded a feare of God, in regard of his anger. We feare the sword of man, and that lawfully, why then Rom. 13. 4. may we not feare the punishment of God? If it be said, this is a seruile feare, to feare the punishment, and agrees not to Gods chil∣dren: I answer, slauish feare is, when a man only fears the punishment, & not the offence of God, or at least the punishment more then the offence. The second vertue of Adoration, is in∣ward Obedience of the hidden man of the heart. The Lord preferres this obedience be∣fore all sacrifice, 1. Sam. 15. 22. This standeth in two things. First, in yeelding subiection of the Conscience to the commaundements, threatnings, and promises of God, so as we are willing, that it should become bound vn∣to them. Secondly, when the rest of the powers of the soule, in their place and time, performe obedience vnto God. And by this meanes doe we bring into captiuitie, euery thought vnto the obedience of Christ, as Paul speaketh, 2. Cor. 10. 5. The third vertue of Adoration, is Patience; which is, when a man in his afflictions, sub∣mitteth
his will to the will of God, and qui∣eteth his heart therein, because God sendeth afflictions. This was Dauids counsell, Be silent before the Lord, and alwaies waite vpon his plea∣sure. And his practise, when in trouble he re∣signed Psal. 37. 7. himselfe into the hands of God, and said, Lord, if I please thee not, loe I am here, doe with me as seemeth good in thine eyes. This pati∣ence 1. Sam. 15. 26. is a part of Gods worship, because it is a kind of obedience. The fourth vertue of Adoration, is Thank∣fulnesse to God, which shewes it selfe in two things. First, in an acknowledgement of the heart, that our selues and whatsoeuer we haue, is Gods, and proceedeth from his blessing alone. Secondly, in a consecration of our bodies, soules, liues, callings, and la∣bours to the honour and seruice of God. Thus much of the first head of Inward wor∣ship, or the first action of the heart, standing in Adoration. Sect. 2. The second Action of the heart in Inward Cleauing to God. worship, or the second part thereof, is Clea∣uing vnto God. Now we cleaue vnto God by foure things: by Faith, Hope, Loue, and inward Inuocation. By Faith, I meane true iustifying faith, whereby we rest vpon Gods mercie for the forgiuenes of our sinnes, and life euerlasting: and vpon his prouidence, for the things of
this life. Thus Abraham, beeing strengthened in this faith, and relying by it vpon Gods promises made vnto him, gaue glorie vnto God, Rom. 4. 20. This Sauing faith, is the ve∣ry roote, and beginning of all true worship. For Loue, which is the fulfilling of the Law, must come from it. 1. Tim. 1. 5. The second is Hope, which followes and dependes vpon faith: and it is that grace of God, whereby with patience we waite the Lords leisure, for the performance of his promises, especially touching redemption, and life eternall. If we hope (saith Paul) for that we haue not, we doe with patience expect it, Rom. 8. 25. The third, is Loue of God; which hath two effects in the heart. First, it makes the heart to cleaue vnto God, and to be well pleased with him simply for himselfe. In this manner God the father louing Christ, testifi∣eth that he was well pleased in him, Matth. 3. 17. Secondly, it mooues the heart to seeke by all meanes possible, to haue true fellowship with God in Christ. This the Church notably expresseth in the Canticles. The fourth, is Inward praier, or Inuocati∣on of the heart; and it is nothing els, but the lifting vp of the heart vnto God, according to his will, by desires and grones vnspeaka∣ble. Or, it is a worke of the heart, whereby it flies vnto God for help in distresse, & makes him a rocke of defence. When the children
of Israel were afflicted, They remembred that God was their strength, and the most high God their redeemer, Psal. 78. 35. Of this kinde of prayer Paul speakes, when he saith, pray con∣tinually, 1. Thess. 5. 17. For solemne prayer conceiued, and vttered in forme of words, cannot alwaies be vsed: but we are to lift vp our hearts vnto God, vpon euery occasion, that by inward and holy motions and affe∣ctions, they may be (as it were) knitte vnto him. Now to conclude this point touching In∣ward worship, we must remember that it a∣lone is properly, simply, and of it selfe, the worship of God; and the Outward is not simply the worship of God, but onely so farre forth as it is quickned by the Inward, and grounded vpon it. For God is a Spirit, and therefore the true worship that is done vnto him, must be performed in spirit and truth, Ioh. 4. 24.
CHAP. VI. Of the outward worship of God, and the first head thereof, Prayer. THus much of the Inward wor∣ship of God. The Outward is that, which is performed by the bodie externally, eitherin word or deede. To this be∣long many particulars, which I will reduce to eight seuerall heads. I. Prayer. II. The hearing of the word preached. III. The vse of the Sacraments. IV. Outward Adoration. V. Confession. VI. An Oath. VII. Vowes. VIII. Fasting. Touching Praier conceiued and vttered by the voice, there are many Questions of Conscience; the principall whereof are foure. I. Question. How shall a man make a Lawfull praier. lawfull and acceptable praier to God? Ans. The word of God requires many
conditions in making praier to God: they may all be brought to three heads. Some of them goe before the making of praier, some are to be performed in the act of praier, some after praier is ended. Sect. 1. Conditions to be obserued before praier, are three. Conditions be∣fore prayer. First, he that would make such a praier as God may be pleased to heare, must repent. Esa. 1. 15. God would not heare the praiers of the Iewes, because their hands were full of blood: that is, because they had not repented of their oppression and crueltie. Ioh. 9. 31. God heares not sinners: that is, such as liue and lie in their sinnes, and turne not vnto God by true repentance. 1. Ioh. 3. 22. By this we know that God heares our prayers, if we keepe his com∣mandements. I adde further, that the man which hath before-time repented, must a∣gaine renew his repentance, if he desire that his praiers should be accepted. For the very particular sinnes of men, whereinto they fall after their repentance, doe hinder the course of their praiers, from hauing accesse vnto God, if they be not repented of. And for this cause, the worthie men of God the Pro∣phets in the old Testament, doe vsually in the beginning of their praiers, still humble themselues, and confesse their sinnes; as we may see in the example of Daniel, chap. 9. v.
5, 6, &c. and of Ezra, chap. 9. v. 6. &c. Secondly, before a man make a praier, he must first (if neede require) be reconciled vn∣to his brother. If thou bring thy gift to the altar and there remembrest that thy brother hath ought against thee, leaue there thine offering and goe thy way, first be recōciled to thy brother, & then come and offer thy gift, Matt. 5. 23. When ye shall stand and pray, forgiue, if ye haue any thing against any man, &c. Mark. 11. 25. Thirdly, he that is to pray must prepare himselfe in heart and mind, as one that is to speake familiarly with God. In this preparation, foure things are requi∣red. First, the mind is to be emptied of all carnall & worldly thoughts. Secondly, there must be in the minde, a consideration of the things to be asked. Thirdly, a lifting vp of the heart vnto the Lord, Psal. 25. 1. Fourthly, the heart must be touched, with a reuerence of the maiestie of God, to whome we pray. Eccl. 5. 1. Be not rash with thy mouth, nor let thy heart be hasty to vtter a thing before God. For the neglect herof, the Lord threatneth to bring a iudgment vpon the Israelites. Esay. 29. 13. 14. Sect. 2. The second sort of Conditions, are those that are required in praier, and they are in Conditions in prayer. number eight. I. Euery petition must proceed from a liuely sense, and feeling of our owne wants,
and of our spirituall pouertie. For without this, no praier can be earnest and hartie; and consequently become acceptable vnto God. For example, when we pray that Gods name may be hallowed, we must in making that petition, haue in our harts a sense of the cor∣ruption of our nature, wherby we are prone to dishonour the name of God. II. Our praier must proceede from an earnest desire of that grace which we want: and this desire is indeede praier it selfe. Mo∣ses vttering neuer a word, but groning in the spirit vnto God, in the behalfe of the Is∣ralites, is said, to crie vnto the Lord. Exod. 14. 15. We know not (saith Paul) what to pray as we ought, but the Spirit it selfe maketh request for vs with sights, that cannot be expressed. Rom. 8. 26. III. The petition must proceede from sauing and true iustifying faith. The reason is, because without that faith, it is impossible that either our persons, or our praiers, or any other action we doe, should please God, Heb. 11. 6. IV. Euery petition must be grounded vp∣on the word of God, and not framed accor∣ding to the carnall conceit and fansie of mans braine. And this is the assurance that we haue in him, that if we aske any thing AC∣CORDING TO HIS WILL, he heareth vs. 1. Ioh. 5. 14. Now we haue a double ground of our praier in Gods word; a commande∣ment to make the praier, either generall or
particular; and a promise that our requests shalbe granted. Here we must remember two rules. First, Things to be asked are either spirituall, or temporall. Spirituall are such, as concerne God; whereof some are more necessarie to saluation, as remission of sinnes, faith, repen∣tance, and such like: some are lesse necessarie, as hope, ioy in the feeling of Gods mercie in distresse, &c. Temporall things are such, as belong to this life, as meate, drinke, clothing, preferment, and such like. Now touching things spirituall, that are moore necessary to saluation, we are to pray for them absolutely, without any exception or condition. But for things lesse necessary to saluation, and for temporall blessings, we must aske them at gods hand with this con∣dition; if it be his will and pleasure, and so farre forth, as he in his wisdome shall iudge to be most expedient for vs. Herein we must follow the example of Christ, who in his a∣gonie prayed to his father to take that cuppe from him, yet with this condition, Not my will, but thy will be done. The reason is this: Looke how far sorth God commands vs to aske, and promiseth that we shall receiue, so far forth are we warranted to aske, and may hope to receiue. Now God commands vs to aske, and promiseth vs the first sort of spiri∣tuall things, freely and simply, without any condition or exception. But the other sort of
spirituall things, that are lesse necessary, and temporall blessings, he promiseth vs with condition; and therefore in like sort ought we to aske them. The second Rule is: We must not in our prayer; bind God to any circumstances of time, place, or measure of that grace, or bene∣fit, which we aske. V. Our praiers being thus framed, (as hath beene said) are to be presented and offered to God alone, and to none but him. For first, none els can heare all men, in all places, at all times; and helpe all men, in all places and at all times, but onely he. Againe the spirit of God makes vs to pray, and in prayer to call him Abba, father. Furthermore, all praier must be grounded vpon the word; wherein we haue not the least warrant, either ex∣pressely setdowne, or by consequent imply∣ed, to preferre our sutes and requests to any of the creatures. VI. Praier is to be presented to God, in the name, merit, and mediation of Christ a∣lone. For we our selues are not worthie of any thing, but shame and confusion. There∣fore we cannot pray in our owne names, but must pray onely in the name of Christ. Our praiers are our sacrifices, and Christ alone is that Altar, whereon we must offer them to God the father. For this Altar must sanctific them, before they can be a sacrifice of a sweete smeiling sauour vnto God. Hence it
is, that not onely our petitions, but all other things, as Paul wisheth, are to be done in the name of the Lord Iesus, Coloss. 3. 17. And Christ himselfe saith, Whatsoeuer you aske the Father in my name, he will giue it you, Ioh. 16. 23. VII. There must be in praier, Instancie and Perseuerance. The heart must be instant, not onely in the act of praier; but afterwards till the thing asked, be granted. This Instan∣cie, is commended vnto vs in the parable of the widdow, and the vnrighteous iudge, Luk. 18. 1. Hereunto the Prophet exhorteth, when he saith,—keepe not silence, and giue the Lord no rest, &c. Esa. 62. 7. And S. Paul in like manner wisheth the Romanes, to striue with him by praiers to God for him, Rom. 15. 30. VIII. Euery true praier, must haue in it some thanksgiuing vnto God for his bene∣fits. In all things let your requests be shewed vnto God, in praier and supplication, with giuing of thanks, Phil. 4. 6. Christ himself, gaue directiō touching this, in that forme of prayer which he taught his Disciples, For thine is the king∣dome power and glorie. Sect. 3. The third sort of conditions, are those which are required after prayer; and they are Conditions af∣ter prayer. specially two. The first is, a particular faith, whereby he that praieth, must be assured that his particu∣lar
request shall be granted. Mark. 11. 24. Whatsoeuer ye desire when ye pray, BELEEVE that ye shall haue it, and it shall be done vnto you. And that he may haue this particular faith, he must first haue that whence it ariseth, nam∣ly, true iustifying faith, standing in a perswa∣sion of his reconciliation with God. The second is, that a man must doe and pra∣ctise that, which he praies for; and he is not onely to pray for blessings, but also to vse all lawfull meanes that he can, whereby the blessings he asketh, may be obtained. For ex∣ample. As thou praiest for the pardon of thy sinns, so thou must leaue thy sinns, and vse all good meanes, whereby the same may be mortified and crucified. And the like is to be done in all other things, which we aske of God. Thus we haue the first Question of con∣science resolued touching Praier; that then the praier is acceptable to God, when he that prayeth obserueth, as much as in him lyeth, all these conditions before, in, and after prai∣er. II. Question. Whether may a man law∣fully make Imprecations, that Of Imprecati∣ons. is to say, pray against his ene∣mies?
and how farre forth is it lawfull? Sect. 1. For answer to this, we must marke and obserue sundry distinctions, and differen∣ces. First, we must distinguish betweene the cause, and the person that defends and main∣taines the cause. The euill cause which an euil man defendeth, is to be condemned of vs; & wee may alwaies, and that lawfully, pray a∣gainst it; but we may not in like sort, con∣demne and pray against his person. Secondly, we must distinguish of the per∣sons of our enemies; Some be priuate ene∣mies, some publicke. Priuate, I call those, which be enemies of some particular men, and are against them, in regard of this or that cause or matter, and yet are not enemies of God, or of his truth. Publike are those, which are not only our enemies, but the enemies of God, of his kingdome, of his trueth, and reli∣on. Now we may not pray against priuate e∣nemies: we may (as before) pray against their euill cause, but not against their persons; Math. 5. 44. Blesse them that curse you, doe good to them that hate you, and pray for them which hurt you and persecute you. And we are com∣manded to loue our enemies, as our selues. Againe, publicke enemies of God and
his truth, are also of two sorts, either Curable or Incurable. Curable are such, as offend of ignorance, or some other humane frailty, so as there is some hope of their conuersion, and repentance. We must not pray against the persons of these, but onely against their dealings and badde causes, and pray for their persons, and for their conuersiō. Thus Christ praied for those that crucified him; Father, forgiue them: and Stephē, Act. 7. for them that stoned him. Vncureable, are those that sinne obstinately, and of malice, so as there is no hope of their amendment and conuersion. And further, for the better answering of this Question, we must marke another distin∣ction. There are two sorts of men, that are to make praier vnto God. Some that haue extra∣ordinary gifts, as the Prophets and Apostles. Now he that is an extraordinarie man, hath and must haue these two gifts; namely, first a spirit of Discerning, to discerne and iudge whether the person against whome he praies, be incureable or no: and secondly a pure Zeale of Gods honour and glory. The extraordinary man, that is qualified with these two gifts, may pray not onely against the cause of him, that is an enemie to God, but against his person. Thus Dauid did, espe∣cially in the 109. Psal. which Psalme is full of terrible curses, against his particular enemies, and typically, against Iudas. For he had the spirit of discerning, by which he knewe
that they were incurable enemies, and a pure zeale of the glorie of God, which made him breake out into such imprecations. So Paul praies, Gal. 5. 12. that they might be cut off which troubled the Church, &c. 2. Tim. 4. 14. he praies directly against the person of Alexan∣der the coppersmith, that had don him much wrong, The Lord reward him according to his workes. Which must not seeme strange: for Paul had in that imprecation; the Spirit of prophecie, and consequently both the spirit of discerning, and of pure zeale: and there∣fore he might pray against him as he did. But for Ordinarie men, such as haue no∣thing but ordinarie gifts, and want the spirit of discerning, and haue also a zeale mingled with choler, stomack, anger, and hatred; they may vse no extraordinarie praier against the person of any man. All that they may doe, is to pray, that God would restraine their ma∣lice, hinder their badde practises, and turne them to his glorie, and the good of his Church. Therefore Act. 4. 29. when there had beene a Councell holden at Ierusalem, a∣gainst the Apostles Peter, and Iohn; in the first beginning of the great persecution of Christians, in the primitiue Church, it is said, that they departed from the assembly, and praied together with the rest of the Church, in this manner; And now, O Lord, behold their threat∣nings, &c. Wherein they praied not against the Councell, nor against the men that sate
in counsell, but against their proceedings, courses, deuises, and threatnings. And their practise, may be a patterne for ordinary men to follow. In Luk. 9. 54. the Disciples asking our Sauiour Christ, whether they should call for fire from heauen, to destroy his enemies, he sharply reprooueth them, for their intempe∣rate heate against the Samaritans, and tells them, that they had not that extraordinarie Spirit, to effect such a thing, because they were but ordinarie men. Ordinarie men therefore may not pray against the persons of Gods enemies. The Pope at this day is a professed enemie to Christ, and his Gospel, yet no man may pray against the person of the Pope, but onely against his state, king∣dome, and regiment, which is Antichristian; whereby he sets himselfe against God, and his kingdome. Sect. 2. Vpon the answer to this question, there followeth an other. Sundrie Psalmes of Da∣uid are Psalmes of imprecation, wherin Da∣uid curseth his enemies fearefully, especially in the 109. Psalme; now all these psalmes were penned for our vse: It may therefore be demanded, how we may vse these, and such like, when we read or sing them? Ans. I. We must not vse them as Dauid did, namely, as praiers against the persons of our enemies, but onely as prophecies against
the enemies of God, wherein the punish∣ment of incurable men, that were enemies to God and his truth, is foretold. For wee haue not, as Dauid had, an extraordinarie spirit, or a pure zeale: therefore we cannot pray as he did. II. I answer, whereas these Imprecations were directed against particular enemies, we may vse them in some sort as praiers, but how? as generall praiers against all the in∣cureable enemies of God, not against any particulars among the Iewes, Turkes, or Pa∣pists. As therfore as we may vse these Impre∣cations as praiers, so we must vse them with∣out any particular application, to the persons of any particular men. III. Question. What be the particular Cir∣cumstances Of the Cir∣cumstances of Prayer. of Prayer? Ans. There are chiefly foure. I. The voice, or speech. II. The gesture. III. The place where. IV. The time when. Sect. 1. Concerning the Voice, this Question may Of the Voice in prayer. be mooued; Whether a Voice or words, are o be vsed in prayer, or no? Ans. Prayer is either Pubcke, or Pri∣uate.
In publike prayer, a forme of wordes must alwaies be vsed, in a knowne, plaine, and distinct voice. The reasons are these. First, the Minister is the mouth of the whole Congregation in prayer, as he is the mouth of God to the people in preaching. Now as the Minister is their mouth to God in pray∣er, so the people must giue their assent, and approbation to his prayer, by the word, A∣men. But there can be no professed and pub∣lique assent, without a voice. Secondly, God is the Creator, not onely of the soule of man, but also of his bodie; and we blesse God, not onely with the heart, but also with the Iam. 5. 9. tongue: therefore the whole man must pray in publicke. Now in priuate prayer, made in priuate and secret places, by priuate persons, the Voice is profitable, but not simply necessa∣rie. It is profitable, because it stirreth vp the affections of the heart; it serueth also to keepe the wandering minde in compasse, to expresse the affection, and to procure atten∣tion of the heart to the prayer. Yet it is not simply necessarie. For a man is not bound in cocience, to vse a forme of wordes, in all his prayers. Moses prayed, he spake neuer a word, and yet it was a prayer: for the Lord saies vnto him, Exod. 12. 15. Why criest thou? Anna praying in the Temple, her lippes did mooue onely, her voice was not heard, and yet shee is said to pray, 1. Sam. 1. 13. Againe, the
Spirit is said to pray in the Elect, with groanes that cannot be vttered, and yet the Holy Ghost giues them the name of prayers, Rom. 8. Paul biddes vs pray continually, which is not to be vnderstood of a continuall vse of a forme of words, but of the groanes and sighes of the heart, which may be made at all times. Out of this Question ariseth another; Whether it be lawfull, when we pray, to read a set Forme of prayer? for some thinke that to doe so, is a sinne. Ans. It is no sinne; but a man may law∣fully, and with good conscience doe it. Reasons. First, the Psalmes of Dauid were deliuered to the Church, to be vsed and read in a set forme of words, and yet the most of them are praiers. Secondly, to conceiue a forme of praier, requires gifts of memorie, knowledge, vtterance, and the gifts of grace. Now euery child and seruant of God, though he haue an honest heart, yet hath he not all these gifts: and therefore in the want of them, may lawfully vse a set forme of prayer; as a man that hath a weake backe, or a lame legge, may leane vpon a crutch. It is alleadged, that set formes of praier, doe limit and binde the Holy Ghost. Ans. If we had a perfect measure of grace, it were somewhat, but the graces of God are weake and small in vs. This is no binding of the Holy Ghost, but a helping of the spirit, which is weake in vs, by a crutch to leane vp∣on:
therefore a man may with good consci∣ence, vpon defect of memory and vtterance, &c. vse a set forme of prayer. Sect. 2. The second Circumstance, is the Gesture. Of Gesture in prayer. Concerning which it is demanded, what kind of gesture is to be vsed in praier? whe∣ther kneeling, standing, sitting, or the holding vp the hands, or head to heauen, or bowing the body to the earth? Answ. God in his word hath not prescri∣bed any particular gesture of the body: and therfore our consciences are not bound to a∣ny in particular. Besides that, Religion stands not properly in bodily actions, and gestures. Yet touching gesture, the word of God giues certaine generall rules to be obserued in prayers, both publicke and priuate. In Publicke praier, these rules of Gesture are prescribed. First, when publicke praier is made in the congregation, our gesture must alwaies be comely, modest, & decent. Secōd∣ly, all gesture vsed publickely, must serue to expresse, as much as may be, the inward hu∣mility of the hart without hypocrisie. Now these kinds are manifold. Some concern the whole body, as the bowing thereof, the ca∣sting of it downe vpon the ground; some a∣gaine concerne the parts of the body, as lif∣ting vp of the head, the eies, the hands, bow∣ing the knees, &c. Touching these, the scrip∣ture
hath not bound vs to any particulars; but in them all, we must haue regard, that they serue alway to expresse the humilitie of our hearts before God. Thus haue the Holy men of God behaued themselues; yea the Holy Angels standing before the Arke, doe couer their faces, in token of reuerēce of the maiestie of God, Esay. 6. 2. Thirdly, we must in publicke praier, content our selues to fol∣lowe the laudable fashion, and custome of that particular Church, where we are. For, to decline from customes of particular Church∣es, in such cases, often causeth scisme and dissensions. In priuate praier, done in priuate and se∣cret places, there is more liberty. For in it we may vse any gesture, so it be comely, and de∣cent, and serue to expresse the inward humi∣lity of our hearts. An auncient writer is of o∣pinion, that it is an vnreuerent, and vnlawfull thing, to pray sitting. But both the learned before, in, and after his time, haue iudged his opinion superstitious; specially conside∣ring that Religion stands not in the outward gesture of the body, and it skills not much what that is, so the inward humility of a syn∣cere heart be expressed therby. Sect. 3. The third Circumstance, is the place. Where The Place of prayer. Question is made, In what place we must pray? Answ. In regard of conscience, holines,
and religion, all places are equal, and alike in the New Testament, since the comming of Christ. The house or the field, is as holy as the Church; And if we pray in either of them, our prayer is as acceptable to God, as that which is made in the Church. For now the daies are come, that were foretold by the Prophet, wherein. a cleane, offering should be offered to God in euery place. Mal. 1. 11. which Paul expods, 1. Tim. 2. 8. of pure and holy prai∣er, offened to God in euery place. To this purpose, Christ said to the woman of Sama∣ria, Ioh. 4. 25. that the tyme should come, when they  not worship in Ierusalem, or in Sama∣ria, but the true worshippers of God, should worship him in spirit and in truth, wheresoeuer it be. Yet neuerthelesse, for order, decency, and quietnes sake, publicke prayer must be made in publicke places; as Churches and Chap∣pels, appointed for that vse. And priuate prai∣er, in priuate houses and clozets, Mat. 6. 5. Now the opinion of the Papist is other∣wise: For he thinkes that in the new Testa∣mēt, hallowed Churches are more holy then other places are, or can be; and doe make the prayers offered to God in them, more ac∣ceptable to him then in any other; and here∣vpon they teach, that priuate men must pray in Churches, and priuate prayers must be made in Churches, if they will haue them heard. For proofe hereof, they alleadge the practise of some particular persons in the
Scriptures. Of Anna, who praied priuately in the temple, Luk. 2. 37. Of Dauid, who in his exile, desired greatly to haue recourse vnto the temple. And of Daniel, who is saide to looke out at the window, toward the tem∣ple, and pray. Dan. 6. 10. Answ. These places are abused by the Po∣pish Church. For there is great difference betweene the temple at Ierusalem in the old Testament, and our Churches in the new. That was built by particular commandemēt from God: so were not our Churches. That was a type of the very body, and manhood of Christ. Heb. 9. 11. And of his misticall bo∣die, Col. 2. 7. Againe, the Arke in the temple was a pledge, and signification of the coue∣nant, a signe of gods presence, a pledge of his mercie, and that by his owne appoint∣ment: 1. Sam. 7. for it was his will there to answere his people: but the like cannot be shewed of our Churches or Chappells. It will be saide, that the Sacrament is a signe of Gods presence, for in it God is pre∣sent after a sort. Ans. It is true, Christ is present in the Sacrament, but when? not al∣waies, but then onely when the Sacrament is administred. And the Administration bee∣ing once ended, Christ is no more present in the Elements of bread and wine. And in the very act of celebration, he is not carnally but spiritually present.
Sect. 4. The fourth Circumstance, is the Time. The Time of prayer. Quest. What are the times, in which men are to make prayers vnto God? For answer to this question, it is first to be considered, that there is a twofold manner of praying, and consequently two kindes of prayer. The first, is the secret and sudden lifting vp of the heart to God, vpon the pre∣sent occasion. The second, is set or solemne prayer. The first sort of praiers, haue of aun∣cient time beene called Eiaculations, or the darts of the heart. And the time of this kind of prayer, is not determined, but is and may be vsed at any time, without exception. This point I make plaine by these reasons. The first, is the commandement of God, 1. Thess. 5. 17. Pray without ceasing. Eph. 6. 18. Pray alwaies, with all manner of prayer and sup∣plication in the Spirit, and watch thereunto with all perseuerance—for all Saints. In both these places, by praier and supplications, Paul vn∣derstandeth the sudden lifting vp of the heart vnto God. Secondly, whatsoeuer we speake, thinke, or doe, we must doe all to the glorie of God. Now God is glorified, when we doe in all things, from our hearts acknowledge his power, wisdome, iustice, mercie, proui∣dence, and goodnes. And these we doe ac∣knowledge, when we daily and howerly lift
vp our hearts to him, in petition, for some blessings, and in thanksgiuing for his mer∣cies. Thirdly, we are subiect to innumerable infirmities, frailties, and wants, so as we cannot of our selues, so much as thinke one good thought; therefore we are euery day and hower, to lift vp our hearts to God, part∣ly in praier, partly in giuing of thankes, that he would make a daily supplie by his grace. Fourthly, Satan seekes by all meanes to ouerthrow our soules continually; and in that regard it behooueth vs alwaies and vp∣on euery occasion, to lift vp our hearts to God, for his mercifull protection. Fiftly, the gift of faith must grow and in∣crease in vs day by day. And the meanes whereby it groweth and thriueth in vs, are the exercises of faith, not seldome and rare, but daily and continually vsed. Now of all the exercises of faith, none is more excei∣lent, then Invocation and Thanksgiuing. The Second kinde of prayer, is set and so∣lemne; when a man sets himselfe apart, to pray vnto God vsually and feruently: or, when men come reuerently and solemnely together into the congregation, to call vpon the name of the Lord. The word of God appoints no set time for this kind, but leaues it to the libertie, wisdome, and discretion of men. And the ground of this Libertie is this; There is now no difference betweene time
and time, in regard of Conscience, for per∣forming the worship of God, and the duties of religion, (the Saboth onely excepted:) but the principall and onely difference, is in re∣gard of outward order and conueniencie, whereby one time may be thought fitter then an other, and that must be discerned by the wisdome of men. In the New testament, the distinction of daies, and houres, is taken a∣way. Paul was afraid of the Galatians, be∣cause they made difference of daies, times, mo∣neths, and yeares, in respect of holines and re∣ligion, Gal. 4. By this doctrine, we may see what to iudge of the Romane religion, touching set times of prayer. They prescribe certaine houres, which they tearme Canonicall; and they distinguish them in this manner. The first, they call the Matutine, before the sunne rising. The second, the Prime, from the first houre of the day, to the third. The third from thence to the sixt hower. The fourth from the sixt to the ninth. The fift from the ninth to the twelfth, which they call the None. The fixt is in the euening about the Sunne-set∣ting. The seuenth and last, is after the Sunne-setting, which they call the Completorie. Now in these seauen prescribed howers, by the doctrine deliuered, I note three notable a∣buses. First, in that the Popish Church binds men in Conscience to obserue them, vpon paine
of mortall sinne. Whereas in regarde of Conscience, there is no difference of times. Secondly they bind the Masse-priest, the Deacon, Subdeacon, and the Beneficed man onely, to Canonicall houres, whereas those houres differ not from others in regard of performance of Gods worship, neither are these men more bound to pray in them then others. Thirdly, that a man may say and read his Canonicall houres this day for the morrow, and in the morning or after dinner for the whole day; wherein we may see their grosse superstition. IV. Question touching prayer is, How their mindes are to be pacified, which are troubled by sundry accidents, that fall out in their praiers. These Accidents are principally three. First, when they should pray, they cannot frame or conceiue a forme of praier, as other men doe. For remoouing of which trouble, let them remember this one thing. That the vnfeig∣ned desire of the touched heart, is a praier in acceptance before God, though knowledge, memorie, and vtterance, to frame and con∣ceiue a forme of prayer in words, be wāting.
Ps. 10. 17. God heares the desire of the poore, that is, of humbled persons, and them which are in distresse. Psal. 145. 19. God will fulfill the de∣sire of them that feare hi: he also will heare their cry and will saue them. Rom. 8. 26. We know not how to pray as we ought, but the Spirit of God, that is, the spirit of adoption, maketh requests for vs by grones & sighes, which cannot be vtte∣red. Where we may obserue, that the prayer of the Holy Ghost which must needes be an excellent prayer, is made by grones which cannot be vttered in words. The second Accident is, that they finde them selues full of heauines and deadnes of spirit, and their minds full of by-thoughts, and wandting imaginations. This trouble may be remooued vpon this ground; that the defects of our prayer shall neuer condemne vs, if we be heartily dis∣pleased with our selues for the same; and by prayer and other good meanes, doe struggle and striue against them. Rom. 8. 1. There is no cōdemnation to them that be in Christ. In which place it is not saide, They doe nothing worthy of cōdemation; but thus, There is no condemnation to them being in Christ, though they deserue it neuer so much. The third accidēt is, that though they pray, they receiue not the fruit of their praiers. For the remooueall of this distresse, we may con∣sider these foure things. I. The man that is thus troubled, is to
examine himselfe, whether he hath made his praier to God aright or no? For if he pray amisse, he may pray long, and neuer be heard. Our Sauiour would not grant the re∣quest of the sonns of Zebedeus, because they asked they knew not what. Matt. 20. 22. Iam. 4. 3. Ye aske & receiue not, because ye aske amisse, that ye might consume it on your lusts. Paul prayed three times, and had the repulse, because he asked things inconuenient for him to receiue: therefore answere was made, My grace is sufficient for thee, 2. Cor. 12. The man therefore that would make a praier a∣right, must haue respect vnto the matter and forme thereof, as also to the disposition of his owne heart. If he faile in any of these, then God will not heare; or if he doth, he heares in iustice. II. Though men make lawfull praiers vn∣to God, & aske things that are to be asked, and which God will grant, yet God will sometime deserre the accomplishment of their praiers, and not giue eare vnto them at the first. Dauid prayed night and day, and yet was not heard. Psalm. 22. 2. Againe, his eies failed, his throat was drie, while he waited for his God by prayer, Psal. 69. 3. The Angel Gabriel said to Zacharie, Luk. 1. 13. Thy prayer is heard. Now in all likelihood, that prayer of Zacharie was made long before, euen in his youth, yet it was not granted him till he was olde.
The Lord deferres the graunt of our re∣quests vpon good reason. For hereby he stir∣reth vp the dulnes of our hearts, and quicke∣neth our faith and hope. Againe, he makes vs when we enioy the blessings desired, to haue them in higher estimation, and to be more thankefull vnto him; yea in the want thereof, to striue the more earnestly with him by praier for them. The woman of Canaan, was repulsed and called a dogge, by our Sauiour Christ, not for that he intended to reiect her prayer, but to stirre vp her faith, to make her more earnest in asking; as also more thanke∣full for the benefit, when shee had receiued it. III. The Lord vseth to graunt our peti∣tions, two manner of waies. First, by giuing the very thing we aske; Secondly, by giuing something answerable therto, when he grā∣teth not the thing it selfe. Thus Christ was heard in that, which he feared. Heb. 5. 7. He prayed to be deliuered from that cuppe, which notwithstāding he drank of: How thē was he heard? Though he had not that which he asked, yet God granted him the thing which was proportionable to his request, namely, strength and power, whereby he was inabled to ouercome the woefull pangs of that death. IV. We must thinke this sufficient, that we can, and doe pray vnto God, though we neuer haue any request, in this world graun∣ted.
For by whose grace haue we alwaies continued in praier, but by the gift and grace of God? Paul in the like case, was an∣swered by God, My grace is sufficient for thee: that is, thine infirmitie shall not be remoo∣ued; content thy selfe in this, that thou art in my fauour, and hast receiued my grace, by which thou doest withstand this Temptati∣on. To this purpose S. Iohn saith, If we know that he heareth vs, whatsoeuer we aske, we know that we haue the petitions graunted which we desired of him, 1. Ioh. 5. 15. His meaning is, if we can perceiue, and discerne that God list∣neth to our praiers; hereby we may assure our selues that he graunts our requests. Now by this we may perceiue that he doth listen, and giue eare to vs, because the grace where∣by we pray, is from him alone.
CHAP. VII. Of the second head of Gods worship, the hearing of the word preached. THus much touching the first head of Outward worship, namely, Prayer. Nowe fol∣lowes the next, which is the Hearing of the Word preached. The Questions concerning this point, are of two sorts. Some concerne the Preachers of the word, and some the Hearers. The first sort I omit, and reserue them, to a more proper place. For the second sort, concerning Hearers, one Question may be mooued; How any man may profi∣tably, to his owne comfort and saluation, heare the word of God? The necessitie of this Question appeares, by that speciall Caueat, giuen by our Sauiour Christ, Luk. 8. 18. Take heede how ye heare. Ans. To the profitable hearing of Gods word, three things are required; Preparati∣on
before we heare, a Right disposition in hearing, and Duties to be practised after∣ward. I. In Preparation, sundrie Rules of dire∣ction are to be obserued. First Rule. We must be swift to heare, Iam. 1. 19. And this we shall doe, by disburdening our selues of all impediments, which may hinder the effectuall hearing of the word. These Impediments are especially three; all which are named by the Apostle Iames, to∣gether with their seuerall remedies. The first, is Presumption; when the hea∣rer presumes of his wisdome, knowledge, and abilitie to teach, (if neede were) his tea∣chers. The remedie hereof is, to be slowe to speake: that is, not to presume of our owne gifts, thinking our selues better able to teach others, then to be taught by them. For so the Apostle afterwardes expoundes himselfe, when he saith, My brethren, be not many ma∣sters, Iam. 3. 1. let not priuate persons take vpon them to become instructers of other men; but as Paul saith, 1. Cor. 3. 18. If any man among you seeme to be wise, let him be a foole, that he may be wise: that is, let him be willing to learne, euen of his inferiours. And in this regard, let him follow the practise of Naaman, who submitted himselfe to the ad∣uise and counsell of his maide. The second Impediment, is troubled affe∣ctions, specially rash anger, either against the
Teacher, or others. The remedie of this also is laid downe, in the place before alleadged, Be slow to wrath, v. 19. The third is, superflui∣tie of malitiousnes, that is, the abundance of euill corruptions and sinnes; which hearers shall by experience find in their owne hearts and liues. This Impediment hath many branches, principally three. 1. Hardnes of heart, noted by the stonie ground, in the pa∣rable of the lower, Matth. 13. 20. 2. The Cares of the world, signified by the thornie ground, v. 22. 3. The itching eare, 2. Tim. 4. 3. when a man will heare no other do∣ctrine, but that which is sutable to his cor∣rupt nature; not beeing willing to frame his heart to the word, but to haue the word fra∣med to his wicked heart. The remedies of this Impediment, are these. First, euery hearer of the word, must lay apart all supersluitie of malitiousnes, that is, cut off, as much as in him lieth, all corrupti∣ons both of heart and life. Hence it is, that God speaketh thus to the wicked man, Psal. 50. 16. What hast thou to doe, to take my word in thy mouth, seeing thou hatest to be reformed, and hast cast my words behinde thee? To this pur∣pose, the Prophet Ieremie exhorteth the Iewes, to be circumcised to the Lord, and to take away the foreskinnes of their hearts, &c. Ier. 4. 4. And Moses by Gods commandement, was to sanctifie the people three daies before they came to heare the Law deliuered by
himselfe in Mount Sinai, Exod. 19. 11. Again, euery man will and ought to haue a care, to prepare himselfe more or lesse, to the recei∣uing of the Lords Supper: which dutie is as well to be performed, before the hearing of the word, considering that in substance it differeth not from the Sacraments, they bee∣ing the visible, and preaching the audible voice of God. Secondly, euery hearer must receiue the word with meekenes, that is, with quietnes subiect himselfe to the word of God, in all things. Esa. 57. 15. I dwell with him, that is of an humble spirit, to reuiue the spi∣rit of the humble, &c. The second Rule of Preparation. Wee must lift vp our hearts in praier to God, that he would giue vs the Hearing eare. This hea∣ring eare, is a gift of God, inabling the heart, when it heareth, to conceiue and vnderstand the doctrine taught, and to yeeld obedience thereunto. The third Rule. The hearer must in hea∣ring, set himselfe in the presence of God. Now therefore (saith Cornelius to Peter, Act. 10. 33.) are we all here present before God, to heare all things commanded thee of God. The reason is, because God is alwaies in the con∣gregation where the word is preached. II. The second thing required to profi∣table hearing, is a right disposition. Wherein two rules are to be obserued. First, when the word of God is in deliue∣ring,
euery hearer must heare with iudgment. But some will say, many preachers bewray faults and infirmities in their preaching. To this Paul answereth notwithstanding, De∣spise not prophecie, 1. Thess. 5. 20. Yea but what if they deliuer vntruthes? Paul answeres a∣gaine, in the next verse, Try all things, and keep that which is good: and Saint Iohn to the like purpose, 1. Ioh. 4. 1. Beleeue not euery spirit, but try the spirits whether they be of God. Her by the way, we must remember one cauat. There be three kinds of iudge∣ment. The one is a priuate, wherby euery pri∣uate person may iudge of the doctrine which is taught: For he must not heare, hand ouer∣head, but iudge of that which he heareth. Of this Saint Paul speaks to the Corinths, Iudge ye what I say. 1. Cor. 10. 15. The second is, the iudgement of the Prophet or minister: And this is a surer kind of iudgement then the former, proceeding from a greater measure of Gods grace. The third is the iudgement of the Holy Ghost in scripture; and this is so∣ueraigne and absolute. For the Holy Ghost iudgeth all, and is iudged of none. These three kinds of iudgment are set in this order. The first depends vpon the second, the se∣cond vpon the third, and the third is absolute and iudged of none. Vpon this caueat, two things doe follow; First, that a priuate hearer, though he may iudge of doctrine deliuered, yet he may not
censure the Teacher, or his ministrie. Mi∣nisters are to be iudged; but their spirit is not subiect to euery priuate man; but to the pro∣phets. For the spirit of the prophet; that is, the doctrine which the prophets bring, beeing inspired by the Holy Ghost, is subiect to the Prophets. 1. Cor. 14. 32. Secondly, a priuate man, is not to publish or broach any point of doctrine, but that which is plainly propoun∣ded in the word, and taught by the ministers thereof. This is a necessarie rule; and the want of obseruation thereof, is the cause of many scismes and haeresies in the Church. The Lord commands the people, Mal. 2. 7. to require the law at the mouth of the priest in all maine points of faith and manners. The second Rule to be obserued in hear∣ing. Euery hearer must haue care that the word of God be rooted, and grounded in his heart, like good feede, in good ground: which Saint Iames expresseth, Iam. 1. 21. Re∣ceiue with meekenes the ingrafted word. Here generally it is to be remembred, that not onely ignorant people, but euen the most learned, ought to be hearers of the word preached. For the preaching thereof serues not onely for the increasing of knowledge, but also for the reformation of the affection, which may be inordinate, where knowledge doth abound. Now for the rooting of the word of God in our hearts, sundry things are required.
First, a true & right vnderstanding therof. Secondly, it must be mingled with faith, Heb. 4. 1. For the word is as wine, or water of life: our faith is the sugar that sweetneth it, and giues it a pleasant relish. The word ther∣fore must be tempered, and mixed with our saith, that it may become profitable vnto vs. Now in this mixture, there is required a dou∣ble faith; the first generall, whereby we be∣leeue the doctrine deliuered to be true, so as we neuer call the same into question; Our Gospell to you (saith Paul) was in much assurance, 1. Thess. 1. 5. The second special, whereby we apply the word preached vnto our selues, for the humbling and comforting of our hearts. Thirdly, we must labour to be affected with the word. Thus Iosiah his heart is said to melt at the reading of the law, 2. Chro. 34. 27. And the people reioyced greatly, because they vnderstood the word which the Leuites had taught them. Neh. 8. 12. The hearts of the two disciples that went to Emmaus, bur∣ned within them when Christ opened vnto them the scriptures, Luc. 24. 32. And the Iewes at Peters sermon, were pricked in their hearts, and said, Men, and brethren, what shall we doe? Act. 2. 37. Fourthly, the word of God must dwell plenteously in vs, Coll. 3. 16. This is doth, when it rules, and beares the greatest sway in the heart, and is not ouerruled by any corrupt
affection. III. The duties to be performed after hearing, are these. First, the doctrine deliuered, must be trea∣sured vp in the heart, and practised in life. Psal. 119. 11. I haue hid thy word in my heart, that I might not sinne against thee. Secondly, a man must meditate on the word which he hath heard, with lifting vp of his heart vnto God. The beasts that were clouen footed, and chewed the cudde, were fittest both for meate vnto man, and for sa∣crifice to God, Levit. 11. It was the olde and auncient opinion of the Church, that this chewing the cudde, signified holy meditati∣ons. And he that heares the word, must doe as the beast doth, fetch vp the meate out of his bellie againe, and chewe it ouer a new. The man that doth so, is the fittest for the Lords vse. Thirdly, he must haue experience of the word of God in himselfe. Psal. 34. 8. Tast and see how gracious the Lord is. Fourthly, he is to examine himselfe after he hath heard the word. Thus Dauid saith of himselfe, Psal. 119. 59. I haue considered my wayes, and turned my feete vnto thy testimo∣nies. Fiftly, he must be obedient vnto it, and testifie his obediēce, though not at all times, yet whensoeuer occasion is offered. Iam. 1. 22. Be ye doers of the word, and not hearers one∣ly,
deceiuing your owne selues. II. Question touching hearers is, How are they to be comfor∣ted, who after long hearing of the word, either profit very li∣tle, or not at all? For resolution of this Question, the Cau∣ses of not profiting, are distinctly to be con∣sidered. And they are of two sorts. The first sort of Causes, are the sinnes of the hearers. And that sinnes are the causes of not profiting, it will appeare by this signe; if the memorie, vnderstanding, and other parts of the minde in common mat∣ters, be strong and pregnant, but dull and weake in apprehending, and retaining the doctrine taught. Now these sinnes are prin∣cipally two. First, Hardnes of heart, when a man is not inwardly mooued and affected with the word preached, but remaines in the same state he was before. This is set forth by the hard ground, that is by the high way side, and by the stonie ground, Math. 13. 4, 5. And such is the heart that is not mooued nor af∣fected either with ioy, sorrow, feare, or con∣solation. The hardnes of heart, ariseth from a custome in sinning and from that the de∣ceitfulnesse of sinne, Heb. 3. 13.
Secondly, worldly Cares, that is, a heart possessed with desire of profits, pleasures, honours, preferments, and such like; which be as thornes that choake the seede of the word, and suffer it not to grow and fructifie: yea that fill the heart full of wandering ima∣ginations, which steale away the mind from attending to the word preached. Those that are thus hindred from profiting, are rather to be reprooued, then comforted: for that the cause of their non-proficiencie, is in, & from themselues. They are therefore to vse all good meanes for the remooueall of their sinnes, that of hard hearted and carnall, they may become good and profitable hearers of the word. The meanes are these. First, they must labour to be touched in heart, with sense and feeling, of their spiri∣tuall pouertie, and want of Gods fauour and mercie in the pardon of their sinnes. The reason is giuen of Dauid, Psal. 25. 9. The Lord teacheth the humble his waies. And by Marie, in her song, Luk. 1. 35. He hath filled the hun∣grie with good things, and the rich he hath sent emptie away. The second meanes is, to heare the word of God with an honest heart, ioy∣ned with a constant purpose of not sinning. The third, to be as carefull to bring good affections, as a good vnderstanding. For affe∣ctions are the feete that carrie the heart, and Salomon biddes vs to take heede to our feete, when we enter into the house of God, Eccl.
4. 17. They are the very key of knowledge and memory; and therefore Dauid saies, The secret of the Lord is reuealed to those that feare him, and his couenant is to giue them vnderstan∣ding: Psal. 25. 14. And that which he saith of Feare, may be said also of other good affecti∣ons. The second sort of Causes, are ordinary and vsuall defects of naturall gifts; as of ca∣pacity, or conceipt, of memory, and vnder∣standing. For all men haue not the like gifts of nature, and therfore all men cannot reape benefit by the word preached. These wants may be discerned thus; If the mind and me∣mory be weake or wanting, as well in com∣mon wordly matters, as in diuine things that belong to gods kingdome. And to this kinde of men which are thus troubled for not pro∣fiting, there belongeth comfort; Yet not sim∣ply, but vpon these conditions. First, if they know the principall grounds of religion. Se∣condly, if they haue care to profit and in∣crease in knowledge. Thirdly, if they liue according to the measure of their know∣ledge, in obedience to Gods will. These bee∣ing obserued, such parties are to comfort themselues in this, that God in mercy will accept of their indeauour, forgiue their ig∣norance, and beare with their infirmities. This is to be seene in the example of Peter, whose faith was highly commended by Christ, when he said, the gates of hell should not
preuaile against it. Matt. 16. 16. And yet at that very time, Peter was ignorant of many maine pointes of Religion, as of the death, resurrection, and ascension of Christ. And in his person, the other discisples are com∣mended also for their faith, because they held Christ to be the Messias and Sauiour of the world, though they were ignorant of the manner of his redemption, thinking he should haue beene an earthly king. Act. 1. A∣gaine, the want of knowledge in such as haue naturall defects, may be supplied by good affection, if they be not wanting in an honest heart, and carefull indeauour of god∣ly life. Thus the Church of the Iewes in the old Testament, did farre exceede the Church of the new, in good affection, though it came farre short of it in knowledge and appre∣hension.
CHAP. VIII. Of the Sacraments in generall, the reeeiuing, and vse of them. IN the next place, fol∣low the Questions of con∣science touching the third part of Gods Outward worship, namely, the Sa∣craments; and these con∣cerne either the admini∣stration, or the receiuing of them. The Ad∣ministration I will here let passe, and handle those Questions onely, that concerne the re∣ceiuing and vse thereof, both in generall and in particular. Touching the receiuing of the Sacraments in generall, there is one onely Question Whether the Sacraments ministred by Heretickes, Ido∣latours and vnsufficient mini∣sters be Sacraments or no? For answere hereunto, we are to knowe there be three sorts of men that may admi∣nister
the Sacraments. Some are true & law∣full ministers, lawfully called by God & men to that function, keeping the right forme of the Sacrament according to the institution. Some againe, are more priuate persons, that haue no authoritie at all to administer, whome we may oppose to the former sort as contrary to them in this action. Others a∣gaine be admitted to stand in the roome of lawfull ministers by the acceptation & con∣sent of men, or by custome, though corrupt, and these are in a meane betweene the two former sorts. Of the first there is no question. But the Sacramēt administred by the second is in truth a meere nullitie; because they haue no calling thereto, neither can they doe it of faith: forasmuch as they haue neither precept nor exāple out of the word of God. Now for the third sort, though they be not indeede lawfull pastors; yet beeing in the place of such, by the consent, allowance, and custome of men, though corrupt; their action is of force, and the Sacrament which is admini∣stred by them, is in deede a true Sacrament; which I prooue by these Reasons. First, the preaching of the word, and ad∣ministration of the Sacraments are all one in substance. For in the one the will of God is seene, in the other heard. Now the word preached by Heretikes, is the true word of God, and may haue his effect. The Scribes and Pharises, great Doctors of the Iewes,
were not all of the Tribe of Levi, but descen∣ded frō other Tribes. Againe, euen the princi∣pall of them liued by extortion and bribery, and were wicked men, yea Heretikes and A∣postataes, deposed & excommunicated per∣sons. And yet because they occupied the pla∣ces of good teachers, and sate in the chaire of Moses, that is read the doctrine of Moses Law, Christ bids his disciples to heare them. Matt. 23. 3. Prouided only that they tooke heed of the leauen of their false doctrine, and wicked life. Now if the word taught by their ministery was powerfull, why may not the Sacraments ministred by the Heretiques standing in the roome of true ministers be true Sacraments? In the daies of Paul, Phillip. 1. 15. Some preached Christ through enuy and strife, and some of good wil: what was the Apostles iudgement in this case? Himselfe answereth, v. 18. What then? yet Christ is preached all manner of wayes, whether it be vnder a pretence or sin∣ceerely, and I therein ioy, yea and will ioy. Secondly, this point is plaine by examples. The Leviticall priests vnder the Lawe, were Heretickes, and taught after a sort the breach of the morall law. Yea they held iustification by workes, Rom. 10. 3. and yet Circumcision by them administred, was in force; neither was the passeouer, celebrated by them, or the sacrifices which they offered, any other then the true Passeouer and true sacrifices. Iudas was a very hypocrite, yea Christ calls him a
Deuill, Ioh. 6. 70. and yet he preached the word at Christs commandement, and bapti∣zed with the rest of his Disciples, Ioh. 4. 1, 2. Thirdly, the Sacrament, if it be admini∣stred in the name, and by the power of Christ, is the ordinance of God, beeing re∣ceiued by faith, yea a true Sacrament of Christ; and the force and efficacie thereof, doth not depend vpon the worthines of the Minister, but vpon Christ. The letters or e∣pistle sent from one man to an other, are au∣thenticall, and serue fully to expresse the minde of the author, though the messenger or carier be a wicked or a naughtie man. And in like manner, the sinne of any man that stands in the roome of a lawfull Mini∣ster, doth not nullifie the Sacrament, and therefore not heresie, or vnsufficiencie. S. Cy∣prian who liued 300. yeares after Christ, was of this opinion, that Sacraments administred by Heretikes, were no Sacraments. But the Churches of Africa in those times conclu∣ded the contrarie against him, according to the doctrine that hath beene deliuered. The Vse. I. By this doctrine they are iust∣ly to be blamed, who would haue their chil∣dren rebaptized, which were before bapti∣zed by Popish priests; because the Sacra∣ment, though administred by a Papist, if he stand in the roome of a true Pastour, & keep the forme thereof, is a true Sacrament. II. Others by this doctrine come to be reproo∣ued,
that refuse to receiue the Sacraments at the hands of vnpreaching ministers. For though the minister be vnsufficiēt, & preach not, yet if he be called by the Church, he hath the place of a lawfull Pastour, his admi∣nistration is warrantable, and the Sacrament by him administred a true Sacrament. If it be said, that then the true Sacraments may be out of the true church, as in the church of Rome at this day; because Here∣ticks and such like Ministers are not of the church. I answer, that there is in the church of Rome, the hidden church of God, and the Sacraments are there vsed, not for the Romish church, but for the hidden church which is in the midst of Papacie; like as the lanterne beareth light not for it selfe, but for the passengers: yet hence it followeth not, that we should communicate with Ido∣laters, Hereticks, and wicked persons. And so much of the Administration of the Sacraments in generall. I come now to the Particular Sacraments.
CHAP. IX. Of Baptisme. THe first Sacrament in or∣der, is Baptisme. And the Questions touching it I reduce to fiue heads. I. Question. Whether Bap∣tisme be necessarie to saluati∣on, or no? For answer to this Question, we must rightly distinguish of necessitie. A thing is said to be necessarie two manner of waies; either absolutely and simply, or in part. Ab∣solutely necessarie is that, which is in all re∣spects necessarie, and the contrarie whereof is vtterly vnnecessarie. Necessarie in part is that, which in some respects, or vpon cer∣taine causes and considerations, is necessarie. This distinction premised, I answer: Sect. 1. First, that Baptisme is necessarie the se∣cond How Bap∣tisme is neces∣sarie, & why? way, in part and respectiuely, that is, in diuers and sundrie regards.
I. As the lawfull vse thereof is a note, whereby the true church of God is discer∣ned, and distinguished from the false church. Not that the church of God cannot be a church, without this Sacrament. For it may want Baptisme for a time, and yet remaine a true church; as well as the church of the Iewes in auncient times, wanted circumcisi∣on, for the space of fourtie yeares, Iosh. 5. 6. and yet ceased not to be a true church, and loued of God. II. As it serueth for necessarie vses and purposes, to men of yeares, that are to be baptized: as first, to testifie vnto the church and themselues, that they are receiued into the bodie of Christ, which is the companie and societie of the faithfull. Secondly, to testifie their obedience to Gods comman∣dement, & their subiection to his ordinance appointed by him for their good. Thirdly, to be a necessarie proppe, to vphold their weaknesse, a seale to confirme their faith in the couenant of grace, and an instrument to conuey Christ vnto them with all his bene∣fits. III. It is necessarie to Infants, as it serueth to enter, and admit them into the visible Church, and withall to signifie their interest in the couenant of grace, and consequently their right and title to Life euerlasting.
Sect. 2. Secondly, I answere that Baptisme is not How Baptis∣me is not ne∣cessary, and why? absolutely or simply necessary, so as the par∣tie that dies without it, remaines in the state of damnation, and cannot be saued. My rea∣sons are these. I. Baptisme is appointed by God, to be no more, but a seale annexed vnto, and de∣pending vpon the couenant; therefore we must put a difference betweene it, and the co∣uenant. The Couenant of grace, and our beeing in Christ is absolutely necessarie: for no man, woman, or childe, can be saued, vnlesse they haue God for their God. But the signe there∣of is not. For looke as to the essence of a bar∣gaine, the consent and agreement of the par∣ties alone, is of meere necessitie required; and this beeing yelded, the bargaine is a bar∣gen, though it be neither sealed, subscribed, nor confirmed by witnesses; so likewise a man may be saued, if he be within the coue∣nant of grace, though he haue not receiued the seale and signe thereof, the Sacrament of Baptisme. II. The bare want or priuation of Baptis∣me (when it cannot be had) is pardonable, & doth not condemne the partie vn-baptized. The thiefe vpon the crosse was saued, though he was neuer baptized, Luk. 23. And sundrie Martyrs in former times, who were Gods
deare children, and died for the mainte∣nance of his truth, though they wanted the outward and visible baptisme, yet by Gods mercy they were not destitute of the inward, and consequently were not condemned but saued. And so many children vnder the law died before the eight day, vncircumcised. Yea when any among them were weake, and could not indure to haue the foreskinne of their flesh cutte, in probability their cir∣cumcision was deferred, and some of them died in the meane time, which neuerthelesse being borne of beleeuing parents, were vn∣doubtedly saved, according to the promise of God made to Abraham, I will be thy God, and the God of thy seede. For as Christ saith of the Sabaoth, so may we say of Circumcision; It was made for man, and not man for it. And it were a iudgement both rash and vnchari∣table, to thinke that all the males of the chil∣dren of Israel that died before circumcision, were condemned. Yet on the other side, the wilfull con∣tempt, and carelesse neglect of this ordi∣nance, when it may conueniently be admi∣nistred and receiued, is deadly and damnable. And to them that are guilty of this sinne, is the threat of God iustly denounced, Gen. 17. 14. Euen that person shall be cut off from his peo∣ple. III. The grace and mercy of God is free, and not tied or bound to the outward ele∣ments.
Ioh. 3. 8. The wind bloweth, where it li∣steth, that is, God giues grace, and vouchsa∣feth fauour, to whome, where, and when it pleaseth him. And hence it is, that they, whome he would not haue perish but come to eternall life, shall be saued, though they be not partakers of this Sacrament. IV. Infants, borne of beleeuing parents, are holy before baptisme, and baptisme is but a seale of that holinesse, 1. Cor. 7. 14. The children of beleeuing parents are holy. Rom. 11. 16. If the first fruits be holy, so is the whole tumpe, and if the root be holy, so are the branches. Yea to them belongs the kingdome of hea∣uen as well as to others. Christ saith, Suffer li∣tle children, &c. for to them belongeth the king∣dome of heauen, Mark. 10. 14. It is alleaged, that those which are sancti∣fied haue faith, which infants haue not. Ans. God saith, I will be thy God and the God of thy head. By vertue of this promise, the parent layes hold on the couenant, for himselfe, and for his child; and the childe beleeues, because the father beleeues. It is obiected again, that infants are born in originall sinne, and therefore cannot be borne holy and sanctified. Answ. Euery be∣leeuing parent sustaines a double person. First, as he is a man, descending of Adam, by corrupted seede; and thus, beeing himselfe corrupted and vncleane, his children also are corrupt and impure. Secondly, as he is a holy
and beleeuing man, ingraffed by faith into Christ the second Adam. And thus by his faith, comes his child to be in the couenant, and partaker of the benefits and priuiledges thereof: and by the same faith he beeing a beleeuer, the guilt of originall corruption, which is in the Infant new borne, is not im∣puted vnto him to condemnation. And for these causes, the Sacrament of Baptisme, is not absolutely and precisely necessarie to saluation, but so, and in that sort, as hath bin declared. Against this Doctrine it is obiected, that Christ saith to Nicodemus, Except a man be borne of water and the holy Ghost, he can not en∣ter into the kingdome of God, Ioh. 3. 5. To this obiection, sundrie answers are gi∣uen. First, if the place be vnderstood of Bap∣tisme, then the wordes may carrie one of these two senses. First, that our Sauiour di∣rects this speech principally against Nico∣demus, who was a timerous professour; and remained ignorant, and had long neglected his baptisme. Secondly, that the kingdome of heauen, is here put, not for euerlasting happines, but to signifie the visible estate of the church of the new Testament; and then the meaning is, No man can be admitted in∣to the Church, and made a visible member thereof, but by the water of baptisme; nei∣ther can any man be made a liuely member of Christ Iesus, but by the spirit, that is, by
regeneration, which alone makes the partie that is entred into the Church by baptisme, to be a liuing mēber of the bodie of Christ. Secondly, others answer, that this place is to be vnderstood not of Baptisme, but simp∣ly of regeneration, and that Christ alludes to the sayings of the Prophets, which speake of cleane water, and expounds the same in Exod 36. 25. this sort; Thou Nicodemus, art by professi∣on a Pharisie, and vsest many outward wa∣shings, but know this withall, that vnlesse thou be washed inwardly by cleane water, that is, be regenerated and renewed by the holy Ghost, thou canst not enter into Gods kingdome. Lastly, it is answered, that the necessitie of saluation lies not in both, but onely in the new birth by the holy Ghost; as if Christ should say, Except ye be regenerate & borne a new of the spirit, which as cleane water, purgeth and clenseth you from your sinnes, ye cannot be saued. The Vse. By this doctrine touching the necessitie of Baptisme, are iustly challenged two sorts of men. The first is the Popish sort, who build the absolute necessitie of Baptisme vpon false and vnstable grounds. For they teach in their writings, that all men are borne in sinne and corruption, and vnlesse they be clensed from it, they can neuer be saued. Now Baptisme (they say) is appointed by God, as the onely remedie and sole meanes whereby they may
be purged from sinne, and come to saluati∣on. And this they snew by a comparison of Baptisme with the brazen Serpent: which as it was the only remedie for the cure of those which were stinged by serpents, so is this Sacrament the onely meanes, set apart by God, to keepe them that are partakers there∣of, from the sting of death and eternall de∣struction. But the answer is plaine out of the for∣mer doctrine. That though all men be con∣ceiued and borne in sinne, and cannot enter into the kingdome of heauen, except they be clensed; yet baptisme is not of absolute necessitie for this purpose. For it is not ap∣pointed by God, as the onely remedie of this euill, but onely to be a signe and signifi∣cation of the purging and clensing of sinne, by the blood of Christ. Now those that are within the couenant, may haue their sinnes remitted by the mercie of God, and that ac∣cording to the forme of the couenāt, though they receiue not the signe thereof; so be it they doe not wilfully contemne or neglect the same when it may be had. Againe, the serpent lifted vp by Moses, in it selfe, and by it owne vertue was a bare signe, and was no remedie to cure the diseased Israelites: but they were cured by their faith in the word of Gods promise annexed vnto the signe: ac∣cording to which Dauid saith, He sent his word and healed them, Psal. 107. 20. And to the
same effect Augustine saith, That the cure and health of the Israelites, came not from the Ser∣pent, Lib. de mirab. Script. cap. 33. Non in ser∣pente, sed in Domini impe∣rio & promis∣so, &c. but from Gods commandement obeyed, and his promise beleeued. And so is Baptisme a re∣medie, and no otherwise. The second is, the common ignorant sort of people, who thinke that an Infant dying without baptisme, dies without christen∣dome; and that it cannot possibly be a chri∣stian, vnlesse it be baptised. This their opi∣nion is very erronious. For by it they make baptisme, the seale of the couenant, to be as necessarie, as the couenant it selfe. Whereas on the contrarie, baptisme is not simply and absolutely necessarie, so as the partie dying without it, can not be saued, but onely in part, as it serues to distinguish the true church from the false, to be a necessarie signe of our admission and entrance into the church, yea to confirme our faith in the pro∣mise of God. Neither is baptisme of force to make a Christian, but onely to signifie and declare a man to be a Christian, by beeing within the couenant of grace. II. Question. Whether witnesses which we commonly call Godfathers and Godmothers be necessa∣rie?
To this there are giuen two answers. First, that the vse of Godfathers and God∣mothers, is not simply necessarie to the Sa∣crament of Baptisme. For first, it seemes that of auncient times, the parents of Children which were Heathen, and newly conuerted to Christian Religion, were either ignorant and could not, or carelesse and would not bring vp their children agreeably to the word of God, and the Religion which they newly professed. And hence it was thought meet, that some persons of good knowledge and life, should be called to witnes the Bap∣tisme, & promise their care for the childrens education. But now Parents amongst vs bee∣ing better taught and qualified, the other is not of such necessitie. Secōdly, Christ hath in∣stituted and ordained in his word, all things fitte, conuenient, and necessary vnto lawfull Baptisme amongst all which, he hath not any where expressely prescribed the vse of Sure∣ties. Thirdly, the whole congregation assem∣bled together at the administration of this Sacrament, doe present the childe to the Lord, and are witnesses that the childe is admitted into the Church, and is externally in the Couenant. And therefore, I take it to be a fault, when the Congregation doth de∣part before the child be baptized. Fourth∣ly, that which is required of them to promise and performe, may, ye must and ought to be performed of the parents of
the baptized; who are by the word of God to bring vp their children in the feare of God. The second answere is, that though such persons are not necessarie to the essence of Baptisme, yet they are not simply to be reie∣cted; this alway presupposed, that they be fitte men and well qualified. Their fittenes stands in foure things. First, that they be of yeares of discretion, sufficient to vndertake such a charge. And therfore it is a fault, when children are called to be Godfathers, and Godmothers, which neither are come to yeares of discretion, nor able to consider what they doe or ought to doe. Secondly, that they haue at least some knowledge and vnderstanding not onely in generall, of the principles and grounds of re∣ligion, but also of the nature and end of the Sacrament, and of the substance of the pro∣mise wherewith they bind themselues, in the behalfe of their God-children. It was in anci∣ent times, required of such persons as were to be witnesses, that they should know and vnderstand the Creed and the Lords Praier. Therefore those are iustly to be blamed, that call such persons to be witnesses to their children, which though they haue yeares suf∣ficient, yet they haue little or no knowledge of the grounds of the Catechisme, or of the bond wherby they oblige themselues for the
good and godly education of the infants in time to come. Thirdly, they be knowne to be of an ho∣nest and reformed life, not iustly chargeable of impietie, incivilitie, or dishonesty, that by their example the children may in time to come be drawne to holines of life & conver∣sation. For how can he that is of a dissolute and wicked life, be able to bring others committed to his charge to the embracing of true religion. Fourthly, that they be carefull to perform theirpromise made in the face of the Church for the good education and instruction of the child in the feare of God, specially when the parents be negligent and careles in that behalfe. Nor the reasons why these sureties are not to be simply reiected, if they be qualifi∣ed, as hath beene said, are these. I. Because this custome though it be not directly grounded vpon scripture, yet it is not repug∣nant thereunto. For beeing righty vsed and kept, it tendeth to the furtherance of religion and Godlines in particular families, and con∣sequently to the edification of the Church. II. It is no new thing but an ancient comen∣dable practize, continued in the Church of God aboue the space of 1200. yeares. III. Because these parties doe supply the defect of naturall parents when they be wanting, either by death or by negligence while they
liue; if they be answerable to their promise made in the behalfe of the children, touch∣ing the things that belong to their saluati∣on. Yet further touching these persons three Questions are mooued. I. Q. What dutie are they to doe in the behalfe of the party baptized? Ans. Papists teach, that the principall and proper act of the suretie is, the taking of the infant baptized from the hands of the preist, into his owne armes and custody. But this, though it be an action neither good nor e∣uill; yet considering it may as well be done by another, as by him, and the doing of it by another, is no whit preiudiciall to the ende, for which such persons were first appointed in the Church; namely, the good education of infants baptized; it cannot be the princi∣pall dutie of the suretie. But the things required of them, are espe∣cially these. I. To be speciall witnesses of the admissi∣on and entrance of the partie baptized, into the church of God. II. To binde themselues by solemne pro∣mise, in the name of the child, before the whole church assembled, that they will be carefull so soone as he comes to yeares of discretion that he be brought vp in the feare and seruice of God, and be instructed in the principles of faith and repentance, and ac∣quainted
with the promise made by them in his behalfe, that he may frame his life there∣after. III. To haue speciall care of the perfor∣mance of their promise; that by all good meanes which God hath appointed, both publicke, as hearing the word, and receiuing the Sacraments; and priuate, as exhortations and admonitions, in time to come he shalbe moved and incited to forsake the Deuill, &c. and to pay his vowes made at his Baptisme. II. Q. Whether children baptized, come to be of spirituall kindred with the whole Church, by reason of their Godfathers and Godmothers? The Papists answer yea, and they explane their answer in this manner. Looke as by carnall propagation, a man hath a naturall beeing; so by the Sacrament of Baptisme, he hath a spirituall being in the state of grace, according to which he is born againe. Now, as by carnall propagation, ariseth a bond of kindred betweene one man and an other: so by the receiuing of Baptisme, there ariseth a bond of kindred betweene the members of the Church; by meanes whereof, the sureties become as Fathers and Mothers to the par∣ties baptized. We on the other side answer negatiuely, that persons baptized, doe not by their Bap∣tisme become spiritually a-kinne to the Church. Now that this is the truth, & the con∣trary
doctrine of the Papist erronious, will appeare by these reasons. I. The Sacrament it selfe, doth not giue a spirituall beeing, to any man that is partaker thereof: neither is it of force to make a man a Christian, or a member of the inuisible Church of God. But that which doth this, is the Couenant of grace, wherein is promised remission of sinnes, and life eternall, in and by Christ. And the Sacrament, is only a seale of that couenant, and no more. Now if baptisme cannot make a Christi∣an, much lesse can it giue vnto him, a spirituall beeing in the body of Christ, and conse∣quently any such spirituall alliance, whereby one member may be allied vnto another. II. There is not the same reason of Bap∣tisme, that is of carnall propagation or birth. For Baptisme is not regeneration it selfe, but the Sacrament, that is, the signe and seale of regeneration. And therefore though natu∣rall kindred comes by carnall seed and birth, yet spirituall kindred, cannot come to any by baptisme. III. The scripture mentions onely two sorts of kindred, and no more; the one which ariseth properly, from societie and communion of blood, which we call Consanguinitie; the other, which comes by carnall coniunction of man and woman, in the estate of marriage, commonly termed Assinitie. And besides these, the scripture ac∣knowledgeth none.
If it be said, that God is the father of all beleeuers, and that they are his sonnes and daughters, and Christ their elder brother: and therefore there must needes be a spiri∣tuall alliance betweene them all. I answer, it is true: but that this kinred hath his originall from baptisme, and beginneth with that re∣lation, that is betweene the Sureties and their god-children in that Sacrament, it is a Popish inuention, deuised by the wit of man, without ground or warrant in the word of God. III. Q. But be it, that the Papists opinion were true, then a further Question may be mooued. Whether spirituall kinred contra∣cted by baptisme, can be a iust impedi∣ment of marriage betweene the witnesses themselues, or their children? The Papists in their writings answer, that spirituall alliance, beeing farre more excel∣lent Lib. sent. 4 dist. 41. quest. 2. im∣pedit contra∣hendum matri∣monium, & di∣ti nit contra∣ctum. then carnall, is of much more force, both to hinder a man from marriage, before he marrie, and to breake off marriage, when it is consummate. But this doctrine (as the former) is not warrantable. For first, they themselues af∣firme, that this impediment doth not de∣pend Bell. de matr. lib. 1. c. 30. vpon the law of nature, but vpon the iudgement of the Church. But the estate of marriage, stands by Gods ordinance, who hath giuen libertie of entrance into it, to all
men, that are out of the degrees forbidden in his law, without exception: and therefore the lawes and constitutions of men, cannot preiudice, or take away any mans libertie in that behalfe. Secondly, all beleeuers are brethren and sisters in Christ, and therefore are spiritually allied each to other. Now if this spirituall al∣liance be polluted by marriage, or maketh marriage vndertaken, a meere nullitie; then no beleeuer shall marrie in the Lord: for Christians by this meanes must neuer match with Christians, but with Pagans and Infi∣dells. Thirdly, this impediment is a superstiti∣ous inuention of Popish Canonists, onely to increase the Treasurie of their Church, by their multitude of dispensations. And it seemes that they are either ashamed of it, or wearie to beare the imputation thereof. For some of their owne Canons are against it, Decr. Greg. lib. 4. tit. 11. c. 1. which doe allowe Godfathers children to marrie, and a man to marrie his godfathers wife. And the Coūcell of Trent, hath drawn Concil. Trid. sess. 24. decrer. de reformati∣one Matrimo∣n, cap. 2. &c. this affinitie into a narrower compasse, which before was so farre inlarged, allowing the Witnesses themselues to be man and wife, not vrging all the three kinds of kinred, but onely some degrees of compaternitie.
III. Question, touching Baptisme. Whether children of ex∣communicate persons, which are cast out, and not holden as members of the Church, haue right to Baptisme? For better resoluing of this Question, the ground of the answer is first to be laide downe, and then the answer directly to be made. There are two texts of Scripture com∣monly alleadged, concerning the force and vse of Excommunication. The first, is Matth. 18. the second, is 1. Cor. 5. The scope of them both is, to shew, that the man which is excommunicated, is barred from the king∣dome of heauen. For he is not to be holden a true member of the church, but as a Hea∣then and a Publican: and therefore is put out of Gods kingdome, and deliuered vp to Sa∣tan. Of this waight is Excommunication. Nowe in Excommunication, there are three iudgements to be considered. The first, of God: the second, of the Church: the third againe, of God. The first is, when God doth hold any ob∣stinate sinner, guiltie of his offence, and con∣sequently guiltie of condemnation, vnlesse
he repent. This is the first sentence. The se∣cond, is the iudgement of Gods church vp∣on the offender, after that God hath holden him guilty. For the iudgement of the church, followeth the iudgement of God, and doth indeede nothing, but pronounce the partie guiltie, and subiect to condemnation. And the difference betweene them both, is onely this; That God holds the offender guiltie, and the Church declareth him so to be. Now the second iudgement is not to be giuen ab∣solutely, but with condition of repentance, and so farre forth, as man can iudge by the fault committed, as also by the word, which giues direction, how to discerne of the im∣penitencie of the sinner. The third and last iudgement is Gods, whereby he ratifies and confirmes that in heauen, which the Church hath done on earth: and this in order fol∣lowes the second. This ground beeing laide downe, I come now to the Answer. First therefore, the parties excommuni∣cate, are in some respects no members of Christs bodie, and in some respects they are. They are not, in two regards. First, in that they are cut off from the companie of belee∣uers, by lawfull excommunication, and so haue no participation with them, either in prayer, hearing the word, or receiuing the Sacraments. The reason is: for that the acti∣on
of the Church stands in force; God ratifi∣ing that in heauen, which the Church doth vpon earth. Secondly, because by their sinne, they haue (as much as in them lieth) depri∣ued themselues, of the effectuall power of Gods spirit, which might rule and gouerno them. But in other respects they are members, as will appeare, if we consider the diuers sorts of members. Some are members not actually, and in pre∣sent, but in the eternall counsell of God, and are to be in time when they shall be called. Thus was Paul before his conuersion, and therfore he saies of himselfe, that God had seperated him from his mothers wombe, and called him by his grace. Gal. 1. 15. Also of himselfe and other beleuers he saies, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God, by the death of his sonne. Rom. 5. 10. Some againe are members, only in shew and appearance; of which sort are hypocrites, which seeme by their outward profession, to be that they are not indeed, wherin they resē∣ble the wooden legge, that is cunningly fa∣stened to the body, but indeede is no legge, nor part of the body, wherto it is adioyned. A third sort are liuely members, which are v∣nited vnto Christ by faith, and haue fellow∣ship with God in him, beeing iustified, sancti∣fied, gouerned and preserued by his spirit; and withall doe feele, and shew forth the power of the same spirit dwelling in them.
Of these Paul speaketh, Rom. 8. 14. As many as are lead by the spirit of God, they are the sonnes of God. The fourth sort are decaied members, which though they belong to Gods electi∣on, and are plants truly ingrafted into the vine Christ Iesus, yet for the present, haue not a liuely sense of the power, and vertue of the spirit of Christ in them. These may fitly be resembled to the legge of a man, or some other part, that hath the dead palsie, which though it remaine for some time, without feeling, and vncapable of nourishment, yet beeing ioyned to the bodie, it may by ver∣tue of some strong medicine, be recouered, and made whole as the other. Of this sort, are excommunicate persons. For in regard of their ingraffing, they are true members, and can not be quite cut off from the bodie of Christ, Ioh. 10. 28. though otherwise, they are not holden so to be, in a threefold respect. One, in regard of men, because they are excluded, from their holy communion with the faithfull, by the Churches censure. The second, in regard of God, because that which the Church rightly bindeth on earth, is boūd in heauen. The third, in regard of them∣selues, because for a time, they want the power, and efficacie of the Spirit, vntill they be throughly touched with repentance, and beginne (as it were) to liue againe. Now, though in these respects, they be
not esteemed members of the church, yet the truth is, they are not wholly cut off, from the societie of the faithfull. For the seede of faith remaineth in them, and that knits the bond of coniunction with Christ, though the sense thereof be lost, vntill they repent. In this case, the partie excommunicate is, as a free man in bonds, who vntill he get out of prison, hath no vse of his freedome, and yet continues a free man still, though he re∣maine in prison. So also the childrē of God, may still be the children of God, though ex∣cluded from the cōgregation of the church, for some offences. From this that hath beene said, ariseth the Answer to the Question propounded; name∣ly, that the children of such persons, as are excommunicated, are (notwithstāding their excommunication) to be baptised, because they are indeede, and in the iudgement of charitie, true members of the bodie of Christ, though in some other regards, they are not in present holden so to be. Yet further besides the former grounds, consider these reasons. First, children of parents, that are profes∣sed members of the church, (though cut off for a time, vpon some offence committed) haue right to baptisme, because it is not in the power of man, to cut them off from Christ, though they be excommunicated. Secondly, the personall sinne of the parent,
may not keepe the blessing from the child: and therefore not depriue him, of participa∣tion of the ordinance of God. Thirdly, we must alway put a difference betweene them, which doe not make separation from the church, and yet are grieuous offenders: and open Apostataes, that ioyne themselues with the enemies of the Church, to the ruine and ouerthrow of the truth of the Gospel. Fourthly, we must put a difference betweene those, that haue giuen vp their names to Christ, though fallen grieuously; and Turks, and Infidels, that are forth of the Couenant, and neuer belonged to the Church. Lastly, if the mercie of God inlarge it selfe to thou∣sands, yea to infinite generations: why should man be so hard hearted, as to make question, whether such Infants belong to the Couenant? and consequently keepe them from the Sacrament of Baptisme. Out of this Question, ariseth a second; Whether children borne in fornication, haue right to baptisme? Ans. They are not to be kept from it. For the wickednes of the parent, ought not to preiudice the child, in things that belong to his saluation. Yet in this case, some Cautions are care∣fully to be obscrued; as first, that the parent hold the true faith and religion: secondly, that he be by the Minister exhorted, to a true humiliation of himselfe, and to earnest re∣pentance
for his sinne committed, and that before the child be baptized. Thirdly, that their be some appointed, to answere for the Infant, besides the parents; and to make so∣lemne promise openly to the Church, that it shall be carefully brought vp, and instructed in the faith. And the same is to be obserued and practized, before the baptizing of the children of parents excommunicate. IV. Question. How men are to make a right vse of their baptisme, when they become to yeares? The not obseruing hereof, is the cause of many sinnes and corruptions in the liues of men. It is commonly holden a great fault in ciuill matters, for a man not to keepe his couenants. Much more is it a hainous sinne before God, not to keepe the promises, and pay the vowes, made vnto him. For answere therefore to the Question, wee must first take this for a ground; That baptisme both for signification, force, vse, and fruit, continues not for a moment of time, but for the whole course of a mans life; It doth not respect onely the time past or present, but that which is to come, yea, that whole time, that a man hath to spend, from the very act of his baptisme to his death. A∣gaine,
baptisme is the true Sacrament of Repentance, for remission of sinnes; which being once receiued, remaineth a perpetuall Mark. 1. 4. Luk. 3. 3. testimonie and pledge of the everlasting co∣uenant of God, and of the continuall wash∣ing away of sinne in the blood of Christ. This Ground premised, I come to the vse of baptisme, which is two fold. The First is, that it serues to be a token, and pledge of Gods fauour towards vs, and that principally three waies. First, in that it sealeth and confirmeth to vs, the free pardon and forgiuenesse of our sinnes. Thus Cornelius was baptized of Pe∣ter, after he had heard the Gospell preached, and receiued the Holy Ghost; that it might be vnto him a pledge, of the remission of his sinnes, Act. 10. 48. And in like manner, doth Peter exhort the conuerted Iewes, to repent them of their sins, & to receiue the Sacramēt of Baptisme, as a seale and pledge of Gods mercie, in the forgiuenes thereof by Christ, Act. 2. 38. In regard of this vse, baptisme is of great force, to releeue the hart in distresse. For when any childe of God, feeles himselfe loden with the burden of his sinnes; the consideration and remembrance hereof, that God hath pardoned them all, and giuen him a speciall, and certaine pledge of his pardon in baptis∣me; will serue to stay and support his soule. Yea though his sinnes were of force, to make
a separation betweene God and him. Yet re∣membring, that his name is written in the Couenant of God, and that he hath by Gods mercie receiued the seale of the Couenant, he shall not neede to be much dismaied. When Satan tempteth him to doubt of his owne estate, in regard of his corruptions; even then let him haue recourse to his baptisme, and thinke of the earnest and pledge of Gods fa∣uour, which he hath receiued. Let him draw out his euidences, signed with the seale of Gods couenant, made vnto him in Iesus Christ; and that shall be sufficient to stoppe the mouth of Satan, and to repell his tempta∣tions. Secondly, Baptisme is as a pledge of the vertue of Christs death. Doe you not know, saies Paul, that all we which haue beene baptized into Iesus Christ, haue beene baptized into his death? Rom. 6. 3. For they that beleeue, are by bap∣tisme conformed to Christ their head, be∣cause they are by it, buried together with him into his death. vers. 4. This point is of excellent vse in our liues. For it teacheth a man, when his owne cor∣ruption mooueth him to sinne, and he is now euen in the Combate, (the Spirit lusting a∣gainst the flesh, and the flesh against the Spi∣rit;) even then, to call to memorie his bap∣tisme, wherein it pleased God, to seale vnto him the mortificatiō of his sinne, by the pow∣er of Christs death: and consequently to pray
earnestly vnto him, for the continuance of the same power in his his heart, for the con∣tinuall crucifiing of the old man; and the vt∣ter destroying of the body of sinne, Rom. 6. 6. Thirdly, baptisme is a pledge vnto vs, of the Life of Christ, & of our Fellowship with him therein. For looke, as he beeing dead in the graue, raised himselfe to life, by his owne power; euen so, and more then so, being now in heauen glorified, doth he by the power of his Deitie, raise vp vs his mēbers, frō death to life, Rom. 6. 4. A certaine pledge whereof, he hath giuen vs in this Sacrament. Which also affordeth singular comfort and ioy vnto a man, euen in his greatest extremity. True it is, that man by nature is dead in sinne; yet God of his mercie, sealeth vnto him in baptisme, his rising from the death of sinne, to newnesse of life. True it is againe, that all men must die. Yet this is our comfort, that in baptisme God hath sealed to vs, euen our rising from the graue to life euerlasting; and all by the vertue and power of Christs resurrection. This is a comfort of all comforts, able to vp∣hold the soule of man, euen in the houre of death. The second Vse of Baptisme is, that it serues to be a notable meanes, of our death vnto sinne, and that three waies. First, by putting vs in minde, of mortify∣ing the flesh, and crucifying our owne cor∣ruptions.
For if we be baptized into the death of Christ, as Paul saith, Rom. 6. 3. then ought we not to continue in sinne, but to la∣bour by all meanes, as by praier, by fasting, by the word preached, and by auoiding all occasions of offence, to kill and destroy the corruption of our nature, and the wickednes of our hearts, Gal. 5. 24. Secondly, it causeth vs to dedicate our selues wholly, vnto God and Christ; remem∣bring, that we once offered our selues to be baptized, (in the presence of the whole con∣gregation) in token that we should euer af∣terward, consecrate our soules and bodies vnto the Lord, and wholly renounce, and forsake the flesh, the world, and the De∣uill. Thirdly, it causeth vs to labour, to keepe and maintaine peace and vnitie with all men; but specially with Gods people. For Baptisme is a solemne testimonie, of the bond of mutuall loue and fellowship, both of Christ with his members, and of the mem∣bers one with another. To this ende Paul saith, that we are all by one spirit, baptized into one bodie, 1. Cor. 12. 13. yea, and Baptisme is one of those things, whereby the vnitie of the Spirit is preserued in the bond of peace, Eph. 4. 5. V. Question. Whether a man falling in∣to
sinne, after he is baptized, may haue any benefit of his Baptisme? Answer. He may if he repent. And the rea∣sons are these. First, his Indentures and Euidences remain whol, in respect of God, & his name is not put out of the couenant. Which is otherwise in the Evidēces of men. For if they be once can∣celled, a man cannot haue his name put into them againe, Secondly, Baptisme is indeede (as hath beene said) the Sacrament of Repentance; and (as it were) a plancke or board to swimme vpon, when a man is in danger of the shippe∣wracke of his soule. Therefore if a man re∣pent, and be hartily sorie for his sinnes committed, he may haue recourse to his bap∣tisme, wherein was sealed vnto him, the par∣don of all his sinnes past, present, and to come; he standing to the order of his baptis∣me, beleeuing and repenting. Thirdly, to them that fall euen after Bap∣tisme, there is hope of repentance, and conse∣quently of the fauour of God, if they be touched in hart with true remorse, and sor∣rowe for their offences. For hence it was, that Paul calls the Galatians (fallen after they had beene baptized) to the remembrance of the fauour of God, promised vnto them in
the Couenant, and sealed in their Baptisme, Gal. 3. 3. 19. 27. In the same manner, doth Iohn call the Churches of Asia, that had left their first loue, to repentance & conuersion, Apoc. 2. 5. 16. And the said Iohn, in Ecclesia∣sticall Euseb. Eccles. Hist. l. 3. c. 23. historie is said, to haue reclaymed a young man, who had most grieuously fallen after his Baptisme. CHAP. X. Of the Lords Supper. THus much concerning the Sa∣crament of Baptisme. Now we come to the Sacrament of the Lords Supper; concerning the vse wherof, there are two principal Questions mooued. I. Question. How farre forth men haue libertie, to vse or not vse the Lords Supper? For the answering hereof, I propound three Rules. The First. Euery man of yeares, liuing in the Church, and beeing baptized, is bound in conscience by Gods commandement, to vse the Lords supper. In the institution of
the Supper, the Lord gaue a Sacramentall Word; whereof there be two parts; a Com∣mādement, & a Promise. The Cōmandement is expressed in these termes; Take, eate, drinke, doe ye this. And it binds all men in the Church that are baptized, to the vse of the Lords Supper. The second Rule. Euery man of yeares baptized, is to receiue it often. 1. Cor. 11. 26. As oft as ye shall drinke it in remēbrance of me. The reason is, because we haue need continu∣ally to feede on Christ. And herein the Lords Supper differeth from Baptisme; because by Baptisme, a man is once onely graffed into Christ; but being in Christ, he hath neede of∣ten and continually to be fedde in him, to life eternall. And this often nourishment of the beleeuer, is sealed vnto him, by the often vse of this Sacrament. The third Rule. Euery man is to receiue, and vse the Lords Supper, according to the laudable custome of that Church, whereof he is a member, vnlesse there be a iust impedi∣ment. A iust impediment is that, which barres a man from the vse of the Supper, as Suspen∣sion, Contagious, and incurable sickenesse, Absence vpon a iust and weightie cause, as when a man is in his iourney, and such like. The reason of the Rule is; first, if any man refuse to receiue it, when he may conueni∣ently, hauing no iust Impediment; so doing, he neglects and contemnes the ordinance of
God. Secondly, for a man to abstaine, when he is called to receiue it, though happily he may be excused, in regard of some reason in∣wardly knowne to himselfe; yet his absti∣nence is a bad example, and may giue offence to others. Thirdly, the man that may receiue, and yet will not, doth in effect, suspend and withhold himselfe, from the benefite of this holy Sacrament. Now these three Rules, as they serue dire∣ctly to answer the Question in hand, so they doe plainly discouer some errours & faults, in the practise of sundrie persons in these daies. Some there be, that thinke it sufficient to receiue the Communion once by the yere, namely at Easter time. Whereas on the con∣trary, it is to be vsed, as oft as may be; consi∣dering that it is nothing, but the shewing forth of the Lords death till he come: which is not once or twise in the yeare, but often, yea continually to be remembred. Others ther are, that take liberty to thēselues, to com to this Table, & abstaine at ther pleasure; as if it were a thing arbitrary to themselues; which notwithstanding the Lord hath enioyned by expresse commandement, as hath beene said. But some alledge for this their practise, that they are at variance with such and such persons, that haue done them wrong, and whom they cannot forgiue; and in this re∣spect, they were better abstaine, then
come vnprovided. To whom it may be said; that their vnfitnes in this and other respects, ought to be a strong motiue to induce them, at least to vse all holy indeauour, to prepare themselues euery day, rather then a meanes to keepe them backe. For if a man should ab∣staine vpon euery occasion of variance, dis∣contentment, and infirmitie, he should neuer receiue, and so consequently haue no benefit by this ordinance of God. Daily preparation therefore, is the more necessarie, that when they be called, and haue opportunitie, they may come as welcome guestes, vnto that heauenly banquet. II. Question. How may a man rightly vse the Lords Supper, to his comfort and saluation? Ans. Three things are required therevnto; A right preparation; a right Receiuing, and a right Vse of it afterward. Sect. 1. That Preparation is needefull, the com∣mandement of the Apostle plainely shewes, which is directed to al Communicants with∣out exception. 1. Cor. 11. 28, Let a man, that is, let euery man examine himselfe. Now that a man may be rightly prepared, hee must bring with him foure severall
things. First, Knowledge of the foundation of Religion, specially of the vse of both the Sa∣craments. That this is necessarie to Prepara∣tion, it appeareth by that, which Paul requi∣reth in a good Communicant, 1. Cor. 11. 26. to wit, the shewing forth of Christs death, which is done by confession and thanks giuing; and these two cannot be performed without knowledge. The second thing required, is Faith For all Sacraments are seales of the righteousnes of faith, Rom. 4. 11. Now Faith is hereby dis∣cerned; when the heart of the beleeuer, con∣tents it selfe onely with Christ, in the matter of saluation; and doth beleeue, not onely that there is a remission of sinnes in generall, but that his sinnes are forgiuen to him, in par∣ticular. The third, is Repentance, standing in a hearty sorrow for sinnes committed, in a ha∣tred and detestation of the same, and in a re∣solued purpose of amendment, and obedi∣ence for time to come. Here we must remember, that renewed Re∣pentance for sinnes committed, is principal∣ly required before the Sacrament. For the Apostle chargeth the beleeuing Corinthes, with vnworthie receiuing, because they came in their sinnes, without renouation of their repentance. The fourth, is Charitie towards man. For
this Sacrament is a Communion, whereby all the receiuers, ioyntly vnited together in loue, doe participate of one and the same Christ. And therefore, as no man in the old law, might offer his Sacrifice, without a fore∣hand agreement with his brother; so no Communicant may partake with others at this Table, without reconciliation, loue, and charitie. Now further touching Preparation, there are three Cases of Conscience to be resol∣ued. I. Case. What shall a man doe, if after preparation, he finds himselfe vnworthie? Ans. There are two kinds of vnworthi∣nes; of an euili conscience, and of infirmitie. Vnworthines of an euill conscience is, when a man liues in any sinne, against his conscience. This we must especially take heede of. For it is proper to the Reprobate; and he that comes to the Table of the Lord vnworthily, in this sense, questionlesse he shall eate his owne iudgement, if not condemnation. The vnworthines of infirmitie is, when a man truly repents and beleeues, and makes conscience of euery good dutie, but yet sees and feeles wants in them all, and in regard hereof, him∣selfe vnfit to the Supper. Such vnworthines cannot iustly hinder a man, from comming to this Sacrament, neither is it a sufficient cause to make him to abstaine. The reason is, because the Lord requires not therein, perfe∣ction
of faith, and repentance; but the truth & synceritie of them both, though they be im∣perfect. If it be demanded, how the truth of faith and repentance may be knowne? I answer, by these notes. I. If our faith be directed vp∣on the right obiect, Christ alone. II. If there be a hungring and thirsting, after his bodie and blood. III. If wee haue a con∣stant and serious purpose, not to sinne. IV. If there follow a change in the life. Thus we read, that many of the Iewes, in the daies of Hezekias, came to Ierusalem, and did eate the Passeouer, which had not clensed them∣selues, according to that which was written in the Law. And yet, for those among them, that had prepared their whole hearts, to seek the Lord, the text saies, that God heard the praier of Hezekias, and healed the people, though they were not clensed, according to the purification of the Sanctuarie, 2. Chron. 30. 18, 19, 20. II. Case. Whether it be requisite to pre∣paration, that a man should come fasting to this supper? Ans. It is not necessarie. For in the Pri∣mitiue Church, Christians did first feast, and at the ende of their feast, receiued the Lords Supper. And if receiuers bring with them, attentiue mindes, reuerent and sober hearts, it matters not, whether they come fasting or not. The kingdome of God, stands not in meates, and drinkes, as Paul saith, Rom. 14. 17.
III. Case. Whether such persons, as are at contention, and goe to law one with an other, may with good conscience, come to the Lords table? The reason of the Questi∣on is, because men thinke, when they goe to law, that they doe not forgiue. Ans. There be three kinds of forgiuenes; of reuenge, of the penaltie, and of iudge∣ment. Ofreuenge, when men are content to lay aside, all hatred and requitall of euill. Of penaltie, when beeing wronged, they are con∣tent to put the matter vp, and not proceede to reuenge by inflicting punishment. Of iudgement, when a man is willing, to esteeme and iudge things badly done, as well done; and to iudge a bad man, no euill person, nor an enemie, though he be an enemie. Of these three, the first is alwaies necessa∣rie. A man is bound in conscience, to forgiue the reuenge, and leaue that to the Lord, to whome Vengeance properly belongeth. But to the forgiuenes of penaltie and iudgement, we are not alway bound. We must shunne and decline iniuries offered, as much as pos∣sibly we can; but when they be offered, we may with good conscience, seeke a remedie of them, and vse any lawfull meanes, to de∣fend our selues. Therefore I answer to the Question thus: That if a man, going to law with an other, forgiues him in regard of reuenge, when he comes to the Lords table; he doth his dutie.
For doing that, he is not bound to the other, as hath beene said. Sect. 2. The Second thing, in the right vse of the Lords Supper, is the right Receiuing of it. Wherein there be two things required. First, the renewing of our Knowledge, or Generall Faith. And then secondly, the re∣newing of our Speciall Faith in Christ. Let the reason of both be obserued. This Sacrament cōtaines many particular Signes; as not onely the bread and wine, but the a∣ctions about the same. The Signes may be thus distinguished. Some of them are repre∣senting signes; some are signes applying. Representing signes are such, as doe liuely set forth vnto vs Christ, with his benefits; as the bread and the wine, the breaking, and the powring. Applying are those, that doe appropriate the same; as, the giuing, and re∣ceiuing of the bread and wine. The first sort serues properly to renew our knowledge: The second, to confirme the saine by appli∣cation. Now answerable to the scope of the Sa∣crament, must be our right Receiuing, which consisteth, in renewing of our knowledge and faith, in the mysterie thereof. Our Knowledge is renewed principally, by meditation in the vse of the Supper, after this manner.
First, when we see two signes to be recei∣ued, we must call to minde that Christ is our perfect Sauiour, that is, both bread and wa∣ter Heb. 7. 25. of life. Secondly, when we behold the bread and wine, set apart by the Minister, and conse∣crated, by repeating the promise, and praiers made for that ende; we must remember, that Christ was ordained and appointed by God, to be our Mediatour and Sauiour. Ioh. 6. 27. Act. 2. 23. 36. Thirdly, when we see the bread broken, and wine powred out; we are to meditate of Christ, that was crucified for vs, and broken, both by the first death, and paines of the se∣cond, whereby life and righteousnesse was procured vnto vs. Fourthly, the giuing of the elements into the receiuers hands, offers vnto our medita∣tion, thus much; That God doth truly and really giue Christ, with his merits and effica∣cie, to euery beleeuing receiuer. On the otherside, our Faith is renewed, by apprehension and application, in this man∣ner. When the Minister giues the bread and wine, and the communicant receiues them; at the same time, are we to lift vp our hearts to heauen, to apprehend Christ by faith; be∣leeuing him, with all his benefits to be ours; that he was made man for vs, that he suffe∣red, and died for the remission of our sinnes. For these outward symbolicall or sacramen∣tall
actions, serue to no other end, but to sig∣nifie vnto vs, these inward actiōs of the mind and will, whereby we apprehend and receiue Christ, to our saluation. Here by the way, two Cases are propoun∣ded. I. Case. What is to be done, if a man, after often receiuing, still doubteth, whether he hath faith or no? Ans. He must striue against doubting, and indeauour to beleeue; being heartily sory for the weakenes and infirmitie of his faith; And let him withall consider and remember, that God hath not onely giuen his promise, but set apart this Sacrament, to be a special signe and pledge of his mercie contained in the promise, for the vpholding & strengthening of mans faith. But some man will say; Mine indeauour is nothing, if doubting preuaile. Ans. It is not so. For if a man can be heartily sorie for his infirmitie; if he striue to beleeue; if in heart he hungreth and thirsteth after Christ, faith is begunne, and he in some sort doth appre∣hend Christ. The poore begger by the high way side, enioyeth the almes that is giuen him, though he receiue it with a lame and leprous hand. The stomacke that lothes physicke, if it receiues into it at the first, but one droppe of the potion prescri∣bed, and that in very weake and fainting manner, it will be able at length to take be∣nefit
by a greater quantitie, and in the meane time it receiues good. The man that is in close prison, if he sees but one little beame of the Sunne, by a small crevisse; by that very beame he hath vse of the Sunne, though he seeth not the whole body of the Sunne. In like manner, though our faith, the hand of our soule, be mingled with weakenes and corruption; though we feele neuer so little measure of Gods grace in vs; yea though our knowledge be neuer so small; yet it is an ar∣gument, that the Spirit of God beginnes to worke in our harts, and that we haue by Gods mercie, begunne to lay hold on Christ. It will be said further; If I feele not Christ giuen vnto me by God, I doe not, nay, I can∣not beleeue. Answ. In Nature it is true, that Experience beginnes first, and then followes Assurance; but in Spirituall and Diuine things, there is a contrary course to be taken. For here, we must beginne with faith, and in the first place, simply beleeue Gods promises; and afterward we come, by the goodnes of God, to feele and haue experience of his mercie. This point was notably practised by Iehosaphat, who beeing in a great extremity, and seeing no way to escape, practised his faith in the first place, and said, Lord, we know not what to doe, but our eyes are towards thee. 2. Chro. 20. 12. And the like he taught the peo∣ple at the same time, ver. 20. Put your trust in
the Lord, and ye shall be assured. Thus Abraham is said, aboue hope, to beleeue vnder hope the pro∣mise of God, euen against sense, reason, and ex∣perience, Rom. 4. 18. II. Case. If in the very instant of receiuing, a man feele his heart so hard, that he cannot lift it vp vnto God, what is then to be done? Ans. First, hardnes of heart is two fold, sensi∣ble, and insensible. The Insensible hardnes of heart, is a great and dangerous iudgement. But the Sensible and felt hardnes, which is in Gods children, and which they feele and be∣waile in themselues, is rather a blessing, then a curse. Of this, the people of God complai∣ned, Esay. 63. 17. And it must not discourage any Communicant, but rather comfort him, because it is a signe of grace. For if ther were no grace in the heart, corruption & hardnes could not be felt. Secondly I answer, that the benefit of the Sacrament, is not tied to the very instant of receiuing; but if before and after, a man lift vp his heart to God, he shall find comfort, though for the present, he hath not so liuely sense and feeling thereof, as he desireth. This alway provided, that the same partie be dis∣pleased with himselfe, that he cannot doe that which he would, and ought, nor in that measure, that is required. And such a one, must consider this to his cōfort, that though he doe not apprehend Christ, yet Christ ap∣prehendeth and accepteth him.
Sect. 3. In the Third place; After the receiuing of Right vse after Receiuing. the Sacraments, two things are required. First, that Thankes be giuen vnto God, not onely in word, but in euery action of our life, for Christ, and all his benefits. Se∣condly, that not onely for the present, but e∣uer afterward, still we renue our faith, repen∣tance, and obedience. But what is a man to doe, if after recei∣uing, he finde no cōfort? Ans. First he must ex∣amine, whether he hath truly beleeued and repented, yea or no; If he hath not, then the fault is in himselfe, and not in Gods ordi∣nance. If he hath, let him not be dismaied, for the ioy of the Spirit is sowne in his heart; and though it lie hidde for a time, yet at length it will shewe it selfe. Psal. 97. 11. CHAP. XI. Of Adoration. THe Fourth Head of the out∣ward worshippe of God, is A∣doration; wherein we consi∣der two things. First, what it is? Secondly, what be the Que∣stions propounded concer∣ning it?
Sect. 1. For the former. Adoration in generall, is an outward Worship, signifying and testifying What Adora∣tion is. the inward worship of the heart. More speci∣ally, by it we must conceiue, the bowing of the head, and knee; the bending and pro∣strating of the bodie; the lifting vp of the hands, eyes, and such like. Adoration is two-fold; Religious, or Ci∣vill. Religious Adoration, is that worship of God, in which Religion and Godlines is ex∣ercised, expressed, and signified. In it there be two things alwaies ioyned together, and yet distinctly to be considered. The first and principall, beeing the foundation of all the rest, is the intention of the minde, whereby God is conceiued, as an absolute and omnipotent Lord, knowing all things, yea the heart of man: hearing the praiers of all men, in al pla∣ces, at all times; the author, preseruer, and gi∣uer of all good things. The second, depen∣ding vpon the former, is the Outward prostra∣ting of the bodie, as the bowing of the knee, and such like, for this ende, to testifie our sub∣iection vnto God, as our absolute Lord, &c. This is it, which makes Adoration a true reli∣gious worship. The other kinde of Adoration, is Civill, pertaining to the second Table, tearmed by some sociall; because it is the adoration or
worship, that fellow-creatures giue one to another. And this (as the former) hath in it two things. The one is, the Intention of him, that performeth it, which must be this; That the creature worshipped, is induced with ex∣cellent gifts of God; Or, that he hath a pow∣er of gouernment ouer vs. For one of these two, is euer the Ground of Ciuill Adorati∣on. The other is, the Action or Outward Ge∣sture of the bodie; in token that the crea∣ture worshipped, is indued with excellent gifts, and graced with authoritie before-na∣med: Here we must remember, that the bow∣ing of the bodie, &c. and in generall, all bo∣dily gesture performed, is one and the same, both in Religious, and Ciuill worship; and the distinction standeth onely in the intent of the minde. Sect. 2. Now the Questions about Adoration, are two. 1. Question. To what things is Ado∣ration due, and in what man∣ner? Ans. We must distinguish the things that are; and they be of three sorts, or rankes. In the first ranke, comes God the Creator; in the second, the Creatures: in the third, the Work
of the creatures. For the first; Adoration that is due to God the Creator, must not be sociall, (for we are not Gods mates and companions,) but onely Religious. Yea, all religious worshippe is due to God, and to him alone; which I prooue thus. The Devill when he tempted our Sauiour, desired no more of him, but the prostrating of his body; Yet vpon this ground, that he was the giuer and disposer of all the king∣domes of the earth, But Christ denies it, and answers, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and HIM ONELY shalt thou serue, Math. 4. 10. Again, the very scope of Religious Ado∣ration, is to acknowledge the Godhead, and the properties thereof. And herevpon, it must be giuen to God alone, and consequently not to the creature, vnlesse we will acknow∣ledge a Godhead in the creature. Here we are to remember two Caueats, touching Religious Adoration. First, if Adoration be giuen to the true God, with a false and erronious intention, it makes him an Idol. For example; If the body be bowed, with this intent, to worship God out of the Trinitie, as the Turke doth; or if he be worshipped out of the Son, with the Iew; thus doing, wee worship not the true God, but an Idoll. The reason is, because God is so to be conceiued of vs, as he hath manifested himselfe in his owne word, and no otherwise. If otherwise, God is not conceiued, but an I∣doll
or fiction of the braine; and the Adora∣tion is not done to God, but to the Idoll. Secondly, to worship God in, at, or before an Image, is Idolatry & superstion; and God so worshipped, is made an Idoll. For he that thus worshipps him, bindeth his presence, o∣peration, and grace, to those places, to which God never bound himselfe, or his presence, &c. God hath not appointed Images, to be pledges of these things, either by promise, or commandement. Hence it followeth, that the man, which worships God, otherwise then he would be worshipped, or lookes to be heard, when God will not be heard, is an I∣dolater. Againe, God expressely forbids the the worshippe of his Maiestie, in, at, or before any creature in heauen or in earth. Deut. 4. 16. 17. 18. 19. But the Idolater in excuse of his sinne, is wont to pretend many things. First, that whē he worshippeth, he intends not to worshippe the Image, but God in the Image. To this we answer, that it matters not what his meaning is. For let him intend what he wil, if God detesteth that manner of wor∣shippe, it is not to be tendred vnto him, in a∣ny sort. The Israelites worshipped not the calfe it selfe, but God in the calse, Exod. 32. 8. Yet then Moses saith, that they worship∣ped an Idoll. Secondly he alleadgeth, that in the old Testament, God was worshipped before the
Arke; and that there he promised to heare the praiers of his people. Ans. The reason is not alike. For they had an expresse comman∣dement, giuen them by God, touching Ado∣ration before the Arke; and a promise, that they should be accepted and heard. But the Idolater hath no such commandement, or promise. Thirdly, he obiecteth, that Subiects doe kneele downe before the chaire of estate in the absence of the King or Queene, in token of subiection due vnto them; and therefore much more may they to the Images of God, and Saintes in heauen glorified. Answ. This reason is also insufficient. For the kneeling before the chaire of estate, is a meere civill Testimonie of ciuill worshippe, and beeing referred to this end, to shew loyaltie and sub∣iection to lawfull Princes, it stands in force by the commandement of God. But there is no such warrant from Gods word, for bow∣ing to Images; neither is it his will, that they should be tokens, and pledges of his pre∣sence. The second sort of things that be, are the creatures, which must be distinguished into foure kindes. I. Wicked Spirits. II. Good An∣gels. III. Liuing men. IIII. Men departed. Touching wicked Spirits or Deuils, the Question is, What is the Adoration that is due vnto them? Ans. They are the enemies of God, and
accursed of him; therefore no honour or ser∣uice belongs vnto them, by his will and ap∣pointment. And for that very cause, we are to haue no dealing with them at all. Nay, we are vtterly to renounce, and abandon, what∣soeuer things come from the Deuill, or his instruments; as namely all Spells, Charmes, Inchantments, &c. which serue to the wor∣king of wonders, and yet haue no such ver∣tue giuen them from God for that end, either by creation, nature, word, or institution. Now concerning the good Angells; If they did now appeare vnto vs, and we had certaine knowledge thereof, we might adore them. But how? onely with ciuill and sociall worshippe. For so we read Gen. 19. 1. that Lot seeing twoo Angels comming towards Sodome, rose vp to meete them, and bowed himselfe with his face to the ground. By which example it appeareth, that though Angels may be a∣dored, yet not with Religious, or that which is mixed with Religious worship, but with worship purely & meerely ciuill. Wherevpon it was, that the Angell refused the worship done vnto him by Iohn, saying, See thou doe it not: I am thy fellow seruant, and one of thy bre∣thren, &c. Rev. 19. 10. I adde moreouer, that sith at this day, the Angels appeare not vnto vs; we may not worshippe them at all, either in ciuill or religious manner, albeit we must euer haue a reuerent estimation of them. As for liuing men, Adoration meerely ci∣vill
is onely due vnto them, and that in re∣spect of the gifts of God, which we see to be in them, as also of their authoritie and place, which they haue amongst men. This is ex∣pressely inioyned in the fist Commandement, Honour thy father, &c. and confirmed also by the example of Abraham, who stood vp, and bowed himselfe, before the people of the land of the Hittites, Gen. 23. 7. Prouided al∣waies, that this Adoration, be according to the laudable custome of the countrey, where they liue. But for worship, either simply religious, or mixt, it is in no sort to be yeelded them. Thus Peter (when Cornelius met him, and fell downe at his feete) refused to accept of the honour done vnto him; which notwithstan∣ding was not a diuine, but a mixed kinde of worship, performed vnto Peter, in a reuerent opinion of his person, as beeing more then an ordinarie man, Act. 10. 25, 26. In like man∣ner, Mordecai the Iewe denied to worship Haman, because the honour which the King appointed to be giuen vnto him, was an ex∣cessiue honour, hauing some diuine worship in it, such as was done to himselfe. Of the same sort, is the kissing of the Popes feete, which indeede is ciuill worship, but mixed with religious. For it is tendered vnto him, as to the Vicar of Christ, and one that can∣not erre; the like to which, is not done to a∣ny Emperour or Potentate on earth.
Lastly, touching dead men, or Saints de∣parted, as Peter, Paul, and the rest; all the worship we owe vnto them, is no more, but a reuerent estimation of their persons, and i∣mitation of their es. Religious or ciuill Adoration due vnto them, we acknowledge none; because neither we haue to deale with them, nor they with vs. Therefore Romish Adoration of them we renounce, as flat Ido∣latrie; considering it giues vnto them a Di∣uinitie, making them present in all places, to know our hearts, and heare our praiers at all times, which is the prerogatiue of God a∣lone. Now for vnreasonable creatures, no Ado∣ration at all appertaineth to them, but onely a reuerent, and holy vse of them. For Adora∣tion, is a signe of Subiection of the inferiour to the superiour; but man is their superiour, and therefore he is to doe them no worship or seruice. And hereupon, we iustly condemne the Adoration of the reliques of Saints, of the bread and wine in the Sacrament, &c. The Third sort of things, is the Worke of the Creature, to wit, Images. Where if it be demanded, what Adoration is due to them? I answer, None at all. Reasons. 1. We haue an expresse inhibition to the contrarie, in the third Commandement, Thou shalt not bowe downe to them, nor worship them, &c. 2. The superiour must performe no adoration to the inferiour. Now though it should be gran∣ted,
that they were the Images of God, yet man is a more excellent Image then they, and they are inferiour not onely to him, but euen to the baser sort of creatures. The woe is one of the basest creatures vpon the earth, yet it is a worke of God. The I∣mage is a worke not of God, but of man. Man therefore may as well in all reason, and better, worship the worme, then the Image. CHAP. XII. Of outward Confession. THe fift Head of Gods out∣ward worship, is Confession. I meane not the Ordinarie or Ecclesiasticall Confession, but that which is made before the Aduersarie. Concerning which, there be many Questions commonly made. I. Question. Whether Confession of faith be necessarie, and when? Ans. That Confession is necessarie, it ap∣peares by manifest testimonies of Scripture. 1. Pet. 3. 15. Be readie to giue an answer alwaies to euery man, that asketh you a reason of the hope
that is in you. Here is a flat Commandement for Confession. Againe, Rom. 10. 9, 10. If thou shalt confesse with thy mouth, and beleeue with thy heart, thou shalt be saued. For with the heart man beleeueth vnto righteousnes, and with the mouth man confesseth to saluation. And, Mark. 8. 38. Whosoeuer shall be ashamed of me, in this a∣dulterous generation, of him shall the sonne of man be ashamed also, when he commeth in the glorie of his Father, with his holy Angels. This is graunted of all Diuines, saue onely of some pestilent Heretikes. The second part of the Question is, When Confession is to be made? For answering whereof, this must be re∣membred for a Ground, that there is a di∣stinction to be made, betweene Comman∣dements affirmatiue, and negatiue. The Ne∣gatiue bindeth at all times, and to all times. For it is not lawfull at any time, for a man to doe euill. The Affirmatiue binds at, and in all times, but not to all times. For it commands a dutie to be done, which neuerthelesse is not at all times to be done. For example: To giue almes, is prescribed by an affirmatiue commandement, and yet almes are to be gi∣uen onely at fit times, and occasions. Here∣upon it pleased the Lord, to propound part of the Morall Law, in negatiue tearmes, be∣cause negatiues are of greater force. Now Confession; beeing commaunded not by a negatiue, but by an affirmatiue commande∣ment,
we are not bound thereunto, at, and to all times, but when iust occasion is offe∣red. What then (may some say) are the especi∣all times, in which, Confession is to be made before the Aduersarie? Ans. There are two principally, to which all the other may be reduced. The first is, when we are examined touching our Religi∣on, by them that are in authoritie, as by Ma∣gistrates, Princes, Iudges, &c. For at such time we are lawfully called to make confessi∣on of our faith, and may doe it with bold∣nes. Thus much the place before-named importeth, where we are inioyned to be readie to giue an account, &c. 1. Pet. 3. 15. that is, not to euery Examiner; but to those alone, who haue power and authoritie giuen them by God, for that purpose. And the same is im∣plied in Christs speech to his Apostles, Math. 10. 19. And ye shall be brought before gouerners and Kings for my sake, in witnes to them and to the Gentiles. And in this case, not to make profession of our faith, is in effect to denie Christ; to scandalize the Church, and greatly to preiudice the truth. The second time of Confession is, when in the want thereof, Gods glorie is directly impeached, the salua∣tion of men hindered, and our neighbour offended. And then we are necessarily to confesse, though no examination be made. If it be here asked, How we may be able
to discerne of this time? The answer is; by Christian wisdome, which teacheth vs, that when by our silence, wicked men are embol∣dened to speake euill of Gods word, and weake ones occasioned to fall from the faith, then is the fittest time, to stand in the defence and maintenance of the truth. Out of these two times and cases, Christians haue libertie not to confesse, but may lawfully conceale their faith; nay (which is more) their per∣sons; by changing their habit and attire, vp∣pon this ground, because the affirmatiue commandement doth not alwaies binde. Here it is obiected. First, that we are saued onely by faith, and therefore confession is not necessarie? Ans. We must consider faith two waies. First, as an instrument created in the heart, whereby we apprehend, and apply Christ with his benefites to our selues, for our iustification and saluation. Secondly, faith must be considered more largely, as it is a way, to bring vs to life euerlasting. Nowe in the first acceptiō, it may truly be said, that we are saued by faith alone. For there is no grace of God, where by we take hold of Christ, but faith. But if we take it in the second sense, as a way to life, then we may truly say, that it alone saueth not, but hope, loue, re∣pētance, good works, and all diuine vertues. In this sense Paul saith, we are saued by hope, Rom. 8. 24. because by it we wait for our saluation; and hope is the way, in which all
must walke that looke to be saued. Againe he saith; Momentany afflictions doe work vnto vs an eternall waight of glory. 2. Cor. 4. 17. But how? Not as causes, but as waies, signes, and markes, that giue vs direction to our iour∣neies ende. And thus, The woman is said to be saued by bearing of Children, 1. Tim. 2. 15. Which bearing and bringing vp of children, is no cause, but onely a way wherein she must constantly walke to glory. And though in mans iudgement, that may seeme a way of misery and death, yet indeede it is otherwise, if the Children continue in faith, loue, and holi∣nesse with modestie. Againe, the Apostle Iames saith, that Abrahams faith wrought together with his workes, Iam. 2. 2. which are likewise not to be vnderstood, as working causes, but as testmonies and euidences, declaring and manifesting that he was iust in the sight of God. Secondly it is obiected, that confession of our faith to God is sufficiēt. For so Saint Paul seemes to say; Rom. 14. 22. Hast thou faith? haue it with thy selfe before God: Therefore confession before man is not needefull. Ans. The Apostle speakes not of that faith, wher∣by we are iustified and saued, but of that which standeth in a perswasion, of the vse or not vse of things indifferent. And this a man may keepe to himselfe, that is, he may so vse it, as he shall not thereby offend his bro∣ther. That commandement was giuen by
Paul for those times, when men were not fully perswaded of the vse of God creatures, as meates, drinkes &c. but to these times it is not. II. Question. Whether it be lawfull for a man being vrged, to goe to I∣dol-seruice, and heare Masse, so as he keepe his heart to God? Ans. It is not, and I proue it by the scope of the eigth and tenth Chapters of the first Epistle to the Corinthians, where the Apostle disputes the Question, whether the Corinthi∣ans might goe into the temples of Idols, and eate of meat offered vnto them, in the meane time, not partaking with Idolaters in the wor∣ship of the Idols? This he auoucheth to be vt∣terly vnlawfull, & for that purpose tells the Corinthians, That they cannot drinke of the cuppe of the Lord, and of the cuppe of Deuills. Now as this was vnlawfull for them, so it is vnlawfull for any Protestant, to goe to any Popish assembly, to heare Masse. Again, God is the Creator of the Body and Soule; there∣fore he is to be worshipped in both; & cōse∣quently we robbe him of his due, when we reserue our hearts to him, and giue our bo∣dies
to Idolls. To this purpose Paul exhorteth the Romanes, to giue vp their bodies a liuing sacrifice, holy, and acceptable vnto God, Rom. 12. 1. Which place vtterly condemneth the errour of some, who thinke, that God wil be content with the soule, and that they may bestowe there bodie, in the seruice of the De∣vill. But against this Doctrine sundrie things are alledged. The first is, the example of Naa∣man, 2. Kings 5. 18. 19. who said to the Pro∣phet, when I bowe my selfe in the house of Rim∣mon, the Lord be mercifull to me in this thing. To whom Elisha answered, goe in peace. Here (say some) the Prophet giues leaue to Naaman, to worshippe in an Idols Temple. To this, there be sundrie answers giuen. Some affirme, that Naaman speakes only of Ciuill, and Politique worship; and not of Religious. For his office was to kneele down in the Temple, that the King might leane vp∣on his shoulder, when he worshipped the I∣doll. And Naaman makes open protestati∣on, v. 7. that he will worshippe no God, but the God of Israel. Others answere, and that more truly, that Naaman doth acknowledge it a sinne, to goe to the house of Rimmon, and therefore he craues pardon for it, at the hands of God, twice togither, ver. 18. and withall makes a vowe, that he will thenceforth offer, neither burnt offering, nor sacrifice, to any other
God, saue onely to the Lord, and hereunto Elisha answereth, Goe in peace. Yet further it is answered, that Naaman requesteth the Prophet, to pray for him, that he might be constant in the seruice of the true God. And (in case he were drawne a∣gainst his purpose, by humane frailtie, to bow againe before Rimmon, with his King;) that the Lord in mercie would pardon his offence. And to this the Prophet yeeldeth, saying, Goe in peace. As if he should say, Goe to; I will pray for thee, to this ende and pur∣pose. This text therefore giues no warrant for bodily presence, in Idolatrous assemb∣lies. The second Obiection. Iehu openly pro∣fessed the worship of Baal, and yet he dissem∣bled, meaning nothing lesse: 2. king. 10. 18. And the Lord commends him, for his dili∣gent execution of that, which was right in his eies, vers. 30. Ans. Iehu is commended, not for his dis∣sembling, but for his diligence in destroying Achabs house, his religion, & the Priests, with all that belonged vnto them; though in other matters belonging to the seruice of God, he departed not from the sinnes of Ierobo∣am. The third obiection. Dan. 3. 6. Nebu∣chad-nezzar made a decree, that whosoeuer would not fall downe and worshippe the golden I∣mage, should the same houre be cast into the mid∣dest
of an hotte fierie furnace. Now we doe not read, that any moe refused to obey but three, and therefore it seemes, that Daniel did worship the Image, as well as others. Ans. Daniel was not accused as the three children were, and for that cause, there is no mention made of his refusall. Againe, put the case he had beene accused, yet the King tooke no knowledge of his accusation, be∣cause he was in fauour, both with him, and the people. The fourth Obiection. Paul togither with foure men, that had made a vow, yeelded to purifie himselfe, according to the lawe of Moses, because he would not offend the weake Iewes, Act. 21. 24. And yet that Law concerning purification, as also the whole bodie of Ceremonies, was abrogated in the death of Christ. Now if he might doe that, which was vnlawfull, for the auoiding of of∣fence; why may not a man goe to Masse, and so preuent the scandall, which may be taken on the behalfe of the Papists? Ans. It is true, that there was an end put vnto the Ceremoniall lawe by Christs death; yet it was not at the first wholly to be aboli∣shed, but by little and little. Againe the vse of ceremonies, remained as a thing indiffe∣rene in it selfe, till the Temple of Ierusalem was destroied by Titus, and the Church of the New Testament throughly planted. And till both these were accomplished, the vse of
the Ceremonial lawe was no sinne; provided, that it were not holden, or vrged, as a thing necessarie to saluation. Now whereas it is saide, that we may be present at the Masse, for the auoiding of of∣fence; it may further be answered: first, that we are to doe our duties, though men be ne∣uer so much offended: for it was the rule of Christ in like case, Let them alone, they be the blind leaders of the blind, Matth. 15. 14. Se∣condly, we ought not to doe euill, that good may come thereof. The fift Obiection. The Masse is Gods or∣dinance, appointed by Christ, though now it be corrupted by men. Ans. It is a most damnable Idol, yea worse then any Idol of the Gentiles; and the adoration performed therein, is most abominable, and hath more affinitie with grosse Gentilisme, then with the Institution of our Sauiour Christ. III. Question. Whether any man, especi∣ally a Minister, may with good conscience flie in persecution? and if he may flie, when? Sect. 1. This Question consisteth of two parts. Whether it be lawfull to flies Touching the first. Sundrie men are of opini∣on,
that it is vtterly vnlawfull to flie in per∣secution; as Tertullian, who hath written a whole booke of this argument: and besides him, certaine Heretikes, named Circumcellio∣nes, in that part of Afrike, which we now call Barbarit, and some also of the sect of the A∣nabaptists. But the truth is, that sometimes it is lawfull to flie, though not alwaies. For proofe whereof, consider these reasons. First, Christs commandement, Matth. 10. 23. When they persecute you in one citie, flie into an other. If it be saide, that this commande∣ment was limited to the times, wherein the Aposties preached in Iewry, and therfore is temporarie. I answere, No; for there can∣not any text of Scripture be brought, to shew that it was euer yet repealed. And the Apostles (who had receiued this commande∣ment, euen after Christs ascension, and the giuing of the holy Ghost,) being persecuted, did flie from one place to another, as we may read, Act. 9. 2. Cor. 11. If it be alleadged, that if this be a commandement to flie, then all must ie; I answere againe, that though the commandement be generall to all per∣sons, and therefore euery Christian may law∣fully shunne apparent danger: yet the same is particular, in regard of circumstances, of time and place. For though all may flie, yet there be some places and times, wherin men may not vse that libertie, as shall appeare af∣terward.
The second reason, is taken from the ex∣ample of many worthy men recorded in Scripture. Iacob the Patriarch fled from the presence of his brother Esau into Haran, to Laban, Gen. 27. and againe, from thence to the land of his fathers. Gen. 31. Moses, after he had slaine the Aegiptian, fledde out of E∣gypt into Madian, where he liued 40. yeares, Exod. 2. And this was no rash flight, but a worke of faith, Heb. 11. 27. Obadiah the go∣uernour of Ahabs house, hid a hundreth men of the Lords Prophets, by fiftie in a caue, and fed them with bread and water, when Ieza∣bel would haue destroyed them, 1. King. 18. 13. Eliah being in feare of his life, fled from Iezabel into Mount Horeb, 1. King. 19. 3. A∣gaine, in the N. Testament, our Sauiour Christ being in danger, withdrew himselfe, Iohn 10. 39. and that sundry times, till the hower of his passion was come. Paul, when the Iewes tooke counsell together to kill him, was let downe by the brethren in a basket through a wall in Damascus. Act. 9. 25. And when the Grecians went about to slay him, hee was brought by the brethren to Cesarea and sent to Tarsus, ver. 29. 30. Againe, being in danger, he vsed Christian pollicie to saue himselfe. For, by saying he was a Pharisee, he made a diuision betweene his accusers, the Pharisies and Sadduces, and so escaped. Act. 23. 6. 7. And if that were lawfull for him to doe, then is it also lawfull for a man, by flight
to saue himselfe, in case of danger, whether he be a priuate man, or a Pastor. Yet for the better clearing of the Answer, some allegations to the contrarie, are to be examined. Obiection I. Persecution is a good thing, and that which is good, may not be eschew∣ed. Ans. Good things, are of two sorts. Some are simply good, in, and by themselues; as vertues, and all morall duties: and these are not to be eschewed. Some againe, are good onely in some respects. Of this sort are things Indifferent, which he neither cōman∣ded nor forbidden, but are good or euill, in respect of circumstances. And these may be eschewed, vnlesse we know that they be good for vs. Now persecution beeing of this kind, that is to say, not simply good, but one∣ly by accident, may be auoided; because no man can say that it is good or bad for him. Obiect. II. Persecution is sent of God, for the triall and good of his Church. Ans. First, euill things sent of God, may be auoi∣ded, if he shewe a meane or way, how they may be auoided. For example: God sendeth sicknes, famine, the plague and sword; he sends also meanes, and remedies for the pre∣uenting, and remoouing of them, as physicke and foode, &c. And these we may lawfully vse for the said purposes: and in like manner may persecution be auoided, if God offer meanes of escape. Secondly, there is a two∣fold
Will of God, his reuealed, and his secret will. By his Reuealed will, he hath appoin∣ted, that in case of present daunger, when meanes of escape be offered, they may be v∣sed. Now because they that flie lawfully, are assured of Gods reuealed will, therefore in o∣bedience thereunto, they vse the meanes to saue themselues from danger. As for his Se∣cret will, because it is vnknowne, and there∣fore vncertaine vnto vs, we may not rashly presume thereof, and against his expresse will, refuse the meanes offered, but vse them rather, till God reueale the contrarie. Obiect. III. To flie in persecution, is a kinde of deniall of Christ, and against con∣fession: he therefore that flies, seemes to make no confession, but rather to denie Christ. Ans. Christian confession is double, open, or implicit. Open confession is, when a man boldly confesseth his faith, before the Aduer∣sarie, euen to the death. This is the greatest and highest degree of confession; and in it the holy Martyrs in former times, continued euen to the losse of their liues, vndergoing the punishment of death, inflicted vpon them by the Aduersaries of Christ Iesus, for the maintenance of the truth. Implicit is, when a man to keepe his Religion, is content to forsake his countrey, friends, and goods. This is a second degree, inferiour to the former, and yet it is a true Confession, acceptable to
God. And vnder this kind, comes Flight in persecution. Whence it appeareth, that law∣full flight in times of danger, is no deniall of Christ, nor yet against Confession. For some∣times it pleaseth God, to call men to pro∣fesse his name and truth openly, by suffe∣ring: sometimes againe, not openly by suffe∣ring, but by flying: & this latter way, though it be not so high a degree, as is the former, yet it is indeede and in truth, in the measure, a true profession of Christ, and pleasing vnto God. Obiect. IV. Our Sauiour Christ com∣mands vs, Feare not them that can kill the bodie, Matth. 10. 28. Now if a man must not feare them, then he must not flie. Ans. The text speaketh not of all feare, but of such feare, as tendeth to Apostasie, and causeth men to renounce faith, and good conscience. Againe, it speakes of that feare, whereby man feareth man more then God. Thirdly, it speakes of such feare, as by which a man is vrged to tempt God, by doing some thing that is repugnant to his will, and that out of his calling. Now when the Question is of Flight in persecution, we vnderstand not such a flight, as tendeth to Apostasie, or argueth the feare of man, more then of God, or that is repugnant to Gods will; but that a∣lone, whereby we vse the meanes offered, ac∣cording to his appointment; least we should seeme to tempt him, and bring vpon our
selues vnnecessarie danger. And thus the first part of the Question, is answered. Sect. 2. The second is, concerning the Time; when a man may flie, Minister, or other? And for better resolution thereof, we are to remem∣ber, that there be eight Conditions required in Christian Flight, especially that, which pertaines to the Minister. The first is, if there be no hope of doing good, by his abode in that place, where the persecution is. But while he conceiues any hope of doing good, by teaching preaching, or otherwise, he may not flie. This, the Mini∣ster shall easily: discerne in Christian wise∣dome. To this purpose Paul, Act. 18. 10. ha∣uing a while preached at Corinth, and fin∣ding that the Iewes detested him, and his mi∣nisterie, intended a present departure thence. But the Lord appearing vnto him, by night in a vision, warned him to stay: for (saith he) I haue much people in this citie: that is, many that are to be conuerted, and brought vnto the faith. Euery Minister in his place, must haue a speciall care of furthering Gods king∣dome, whether it be by flying, or not fly∣ing. The second Condition. Consideration must be had, whether the persecution be per∣sonall, or publique. Personall is that, which is directed against this, or that mans person.
Publique, which is raised against the whole Church. If it be directed against the person of the Pastor, he may vse his libertie. For it may be, that his flight will bring peace to the Ch. But what if the people will not suffer him to flie? Ans. They should be so farre, from hindering of him in this case, that they ought rather to succour and releeue him. Thus, when Demetrius had raised a tumult against Paul, vnder pretence of Diana, & he would haue presented himselfe vnto the people, in the common place; the Disciples suffered him not, Act. 19. 30. And what care they had of his preseruation, the same ought the peo∣ple to haue of their Pastor, in case of like pe∣rill. But, if the persecution be common to the whole Church, then he is not to flie. For it is necessarie, at such times especially, that those which are strong, should support and con∣firme the weake. The third Condition. If there be in the Pastor a moderation of minde. For he must take heede of these two extremities, that he be neither ouercome with excessiue feare, nor through ouermuch confidence, runne headlong into apparent danger. And that he may auoide these extremities, he must first pray vnto God, for wisdome, courage, and constancie: and secondly, vse the consent and aduise of the Church, for his direction in this behalfe; that all things may be done
in wisdome. The fourth Condition of lawfull flight is, that the Minister withdraw himselfe onely for a time, & not vtterly forsake his charge, and calling. Yea, if he be principally aymed at in the persecution, he may lawfully goe apart; and it is the dutie of the Church also, to see him conuaied away in safetie, till the persecution be ouer. And thus doing, he neither forsakes the Church, nor his calling; but onely vseth the meanes of his preseruati∣on, for the keeping of faith, and a good con∣science. This warrant, our Sauiour giues to his Apostles, Matth. 10. 23. When they perse∣cute you in one citie, flie into another. The ende of that commandement was, that the Apo∣stles might preserue themselues in safetie, till they had preached the Gospel, to all the ci∣ties of Israel, as the next wordes doe de∣clare. The fift Condition. If after due triall and examination, he finde not himselfe sufficient∣ly armed with strength, to resist or beare the extremitie. For then he may retire himselfe, into some place of safetie; where he may liue to the glorie of God, keeping faith and a good conscience. The sixt Condition is, If he be expelled, or banished by the Magistrate, though the cause be vniuft. For subiection is simply to be yeelded, to the punishments and corre∣ctions of Magistrates, though we doe not al∣waies
tender Obedience to their comman∣dements. The seauenth is, If God offer a lawfull meanes, and way of escape; and doth (as it were) open a doore, and giue iust opportu∣nitie to flie. In this Case not to flie, (especial∣ly if he haue not strength sufficient to stand out) is a tempting of God. The eight condition. If the danger be not only suspected, surmised, and seene a farre off; but certaine and present. Otherwise the Pastor falles into the sinne of Ionah, who fore-casted dangers in his calling, and there∣fore preuented them by flying to Tarsus. These conditions being obserued, it may be lawfull both for Pastor and people to flie in times of persecution. Sect. 3. In the next place it may be demaunded, When a man may flie? When a Pastor, or other may not flie? For answer herevnto, the Signes of vnlaw∣full flight are to be considered, and they are principally foure. The first is, when God puts into a mans heart, the Spirit of courage and fortitude, whereby he is resolued to abide, and stand out against the force of all enemies. Thus Paul, Act. 20. 22. went bound in the Spirit to Ie∣rusalem. Where, though he knew that bonds and afflictions did abide him, yet he would not be disswaded, but vttered these words of
resolution. I passe not at all, neither is my life deare vnto my selfe, so that I may fulfil my course with ioy, and the ministration, which I haue recei∣ued of the Lord Iesus, to testifie the Gospell of the grace of God. This motion of the Spirit is not ordinarie, yet in the time of hot persecution, it hath beene found, in many worthy instru∣ments of Gods glory, as may be seene in the Histories of sundry Martyrs, in the daies of Queene Mary. But one especially, (of whom I was credibly informed) that hauing this motion, not to stand out, and yet flying: for that very act, felt such a sting in his consci∣ence, that he could neuer haue peace till his death. The second signe is, when a man is appre∣hended, and vnder the custodie of the Magi∣strate. For then hee is not to flie, because he must, in all his sufferings, obey the Magi∣strate. Here a Question is mooued, Whether a man that is imprisoned, may breake prison? To this, Popish Schoolemen answer, that he may; if the cause of his imprisonment be vniust. And sutable to this assertion, is the common practise of Papists. We on the con∣trary say, and that truly, that no man being in durance, may vse any vnlawfull or violent meanes to escape; for we may not, at any hand, resist the Magistrate in our sufferings. Seruants are commanded, to subiect them∣selues with patience, vnto the vniust corre∣ctions
of their Maisters, 1. Pet. 2. 19. And this reason is giuen; For it is thankeworthy, if a man, for conscience toward God, endure greife, suffering wrongfully. The Apostles, being in prison, v∣sed no meanes to deliuer themselues; but when the Angell of the Lord had opened the prison dores, then they came forth, and not before, Act. 5. 19. And that which Peter and the other Apostles did, must Pastors and other men also doe, in the like case, for Reli∣gion sake. The third signe, When a man is bound by his calling and ministerie, so as in it, he may glorifie God and doe good to the church by preaching; thē he must not fly. For, the duties of a mans calling, must be prefer∣red before any worldly thing whatsoeuer, whether body, goods; friends or life, &c. The fourth signe. When God in his pro∣vidence, cuts off all lawfull meanes and waies of flying, he doth then (as it were) bidde that man stay and abide. I say, lawfull meanes; because we may not vse those that are vnlawfull, but rather rest contented, and resigne our selues wholly to Gods will and pleasure. Wee must not doe any euill, that good may come thereof; and of two evills, not onely not the lesse, but neither of both is to be chosen. So much of Confession.
CHAP. XIII. Of an Oathe. THe sixt head of Gods worship is, an Oath; concerning which, three Questions are to be handled. I. What an Oathe is? II. How an Oathe is to be taken? III. How farre forth it bindeth, and is to be kept? Sect. 1. I. Question. What is an oathe? An Oathe, is a religious, and necessarie The nature of an Oathe. confirmation of things doubtfull, by calling on God, to be a witnesse of truth, and a re∣venger of falshood. First, I call it, a Confirmation; for so the Holy Ghost speaketh, An oath for confirmation, is a∣mong men an ende of all strife. Heb. 6. 16. Secondly, I terme it a religious confirmation, because an Oath is a part of Gods Religion and worshippe; Yea it is sometimes put for the whole worshippe of God; Esay. 19. 28. In that day, shall they swear by the Lord of hosts,
that is, they shall worship the true God. Thirdly I adde, a necessarie confirmation, be∣cause an Oathe is neuer to be vsed, in way of confirmation, but onely in case of meere necessitie. For when all other humane proofes do faile, then it is lawfull, to fetch testimonie from heauen, and to make God himselfe our witnes. In this case alone, and neuer els, it is lawfull to vse an Oathe. Fourthly I say, in which God is called vpon, as a witnes of the trueth, and a reuenger of false∣hoode. This is added in the last place, because herein alone, stands the forme and life of an Othe; that in things doubtfull; we call God as a witnes of truth, and a iust revenger of the contrary. There be sundry kindes of con∣firmatiō, as the affirmation, the asseueration, and the obtestation. And by this Clause, an Oath is distinguished from them all; because in it, we call vpon God to giue witnesse to the thing avouched, but in the other three we doe not. Now touching this last point, of the forme and life of an Oathe, three Questions are to be answered, for the better clearing of the whole doctrine. I. Question. Whether an Oathe taken by Creatures be a true Oath, and to be kept? Ans. An Oathe by creatures, is an Oath, though vnlawfull. For though there be not in it, a direct invocation of God for witnesse, yet when we call the creature to giue testi∣mony,
we doe then indirectly cal vpon God, because he is seene in them; and looke how many creatures there be in the world, so ma∣ny signes are they of Gods presence. This answer Christ himselfe maketh, Matth. 23. 21, 22. He that sweareth by heauen, sweareth by the throne of God, and by him that sitteth thereon, that is, by God himselfe. II. Question. Whether an oath by false gods, be a true oath or no? for example, the oath of the Turke by Mahomet; the oath of Laban, by the gods of Nachor, that is, by his Idols: when as in them, there is no inuoca∣tion of the true God of heauen and earth. I answer as before; though it be not a lawfull oath, yet it is in value & effect an oath. For though that thing be a false god indeed, by which it is taken; yet it is the true God, in the opinion of him that sweareth. Thus Mahomet is to the Turke, in stead of the true God, and is honoured of him as God: and therefore his oath by Mahomet, is a true oath. Thus when Iacob in the couenant that he made with Laban, sweares by the feare of his father Isaak, and Laban by the Idols of Nachor; Iacob accepted the oath which was tendered to him, in the name of a false god; which he would not haue done, if it had not beene an oath at all. And hence the Case is plaine, that swearing by a false god, is an oath: and therefore bindeth the swearer in Conscience, thought it be vnlawfully taken.
III. Question. If in euery oath, God ought to be cited as a witnes, how then can God sweare by himselfe, seeing none can witnes vnto him? Ans. This description of an oath, where∣by the creature sweareth, includes not that oathe, whereby God sweareth. For the ende why God sweareth is, to binde himselfe (as it were) with a bond vnto man, whereby he would haue man to repute him a lier, and no God, if he failes and keepes not his promise. Thus the Lord sweares in his wrath, Hebr. 3. 11. If they shall enter into my rest. The words of the oath, are to be vnderstoode with this clause, If, &c. then let me be holden as no God, or as a false god. And in this manner is God said to sweare, when he manifesteth to man, that he is content to be counted no God, if that which he auoucheth by oath, be not performed. Furthermore in every Oath, there be foure distinct things. First, an Asseueration of the truth; which should be avouched, though there were no oath taken. Secondly, a con∣fession or the omnipotent presence, wise∣dome, iustice and truth of God; whereby we acknowledge, that he is the searcher and knower of the heart; yea that he is both wit∣nesse, iudge, and reuenger of falshood and ly∣ing. Thirdly, Prayer and Inuocation, where∣by God is called vpon, to giue testimonie to the conscience of him that sweareth, that he
speakes nothing, but the truth. These two actions, of Confession and Invocation, doe make an othe, to be no lesse a true and pro∣per part of Gods worshippe, then praier it selfe. Fourthly, Imprecation, in which a man acknowledging God the the iust reuenger of a lie, bindes himselfe to punishment, if he shall sweare falsely, or speake an vntrueth wittingly or willingly. Now, though these be the distinct parts of an Oath, yet all of them are not expressed in the forme of euery oath; but sometimes one, sometimes two of the principall, and the o∣ther concealed, but yet alwaies vnderstood. For example. The Prophet Ieremie teacheth the people of Israel a forme of swearing, Thou shalt sweare, The Lord liueth, Ierem. 4. 2. In which, there is expressed onely the second part, Confession, and in that, the rest are to be vnderstood. Againe, the words of Ruth to Naomi, The Lord doe so to me, and more also, if ought but death depart thee and me, are onely an Imprecation, in which the other parts are infolded. So, the othe which God maketh, Heb. 3. 11. If they shall enter into my rest, is ex∣pressed onlie by imprecation, and the other parts vnderstood, though they be not men∣tioned. In common speach betweene man and man, it is vsually avouched, (though most wickedly,) If it be not thus or thus, let me be banged, I would I were dead, I would I might neuer mooue hence, &c. Now this auouchment,
howsoeuer it may be taken, is indeed a form of swearing, in value and force all one with the oath of God, when he saith, If they enter into my rest, let me be no God, but a deceiuer. Sometimes two parts of the foure, are ex∣pressed, and the rest vnderstood. 2. Cor. 1. 23. Now I call God to record vnto my Soule. Here Invocation with Imprecation, is vttered in speach, and the other two conceiued in the minde. By these particulars, we see it vsuall in Scripture, to propound formes of swea∣ring, by expressing some one, or two particu∣lar parts in stead of the rest, yet so, as the parts concealed be all vnderstood, for other∣wise the othe is not formalland entire. Sect. 2. II. Question. How an Oathe is to be ta∣ken in a good and godly man∣ner? For the answering hereof, two Rules are to be remembred. The first Rule. He that will take an Oathe by the name of God, must sweare in truth, in iudgement, in righteousnesse. Ierem. 4. 2. Here three vertues are required in a lawfull Oathe. First, that it be made in truth. And wee must know, that there is a double truth, the
one, of the thing spoken, the other, of the minde wherein it is conceiued. Truth of the thing is, when a mans speech is framed according to the thing, as it is indeede, or as neare as possibly may be; and that because God is truth it selfe: This is called by Schoolemen, Logical veritie. Sometimes by reason of mens frailtie, this truth is wanting, because we know not things as they are. The truth of the minde is, when a man speakes or sweares as he thinketh, or is in conscience perswaded of the thing; and this the Schoolemen tearme, Morall veritie. Now, though the first of these two be wanting, yet the latter must necessa∣rily be in an oath, least we fall into per∣iurie. The second vertue is Iudgement, that is, prudence or wisdome. This Iudgement re∣quires discretion, and consideration, princi∣pally of fiue things. First, of the thing in que∣stion, which is to be confirmed. Secondly, of the nature of the oath, that is taken. Thirdly, of the minde, and true meaning of him that sweareth. Fourthly, of the particular circūstā∣ces, of time, place, & persons, when, where, and before whome he sweareth. Fiftly, of the euent or issue of the oath. All these are duly to be regarded, that we sweare not rashly, or vnaduisedly. The third is Iustice, wherein also care must be had of two things. First, that the point to be confirmed, be lawefull. And it is then
lawfull, when it may stand with pietie, and charitie. Secondly, that the occasions of ta∣king the oath, be also iust; and they be chief∣ly foure. I. When it may further Gods glo∣rie and worship: or serue to prooue some do∣ctrine of saluation, in whole or in part. II. When it may tende to the furtherance of brotherly loue; or to the preseruation of our neighbours life, goods, or good name: or further, to the confirmation of some league, couenant, or contract made betweene par∣ties, vpon good ground, and for good and necessarie purposes. III. When it serueth, to releeue a mans owne priuate necessitie; as when one sweares to maintaine his owne good name, goods, or life; to confirme his owne faith and truth in contracts. An exam∣ple hereof we haue in Paul; who to confirme the Romanes, in the perswasion of his loue and care of their saluation, saith, God is my witnesse (whome I serue in my spirit, in the Gospel of his Sonne) that without ceasing, I make menti∣on of you, Rom. 1. 9. And againe, to keepe his owne credit and good name, among the Iewes, I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my con∣science bearing me witnesse, in the holy Ghost, Rom. 9. 1. IV. When the Magistrate doth exact it, by order of iustice. This, though it be a iust occasion, and warrant of an oath, yet three Caueats are in it to be obserued. First, that the oath be administred lawful∣ly, not against pietie or charitie. Secondly, he
which takes an oath, tendered by the Magi∣strate, must sweare according to the minde and meaning of the Magistrate who exacts the oath, and not according to his owne pri∣uate intent. Thirdly, he must not sweare am∣biguously, but in a simple sense, so as the words of his mouth, may be agreeable with that, which he conceiueth in his heart. Psal. 15. 2. And whatsoeuer oath is taken without obseruation of these Caueats, the same is not taken in truth, but in fraud and deceit. Po∣pish teachers affirme, that in some cases, they may sweare in a doubtfull meaning: And this they practise in time of daunger, when beeing conuented before the Magistrate, and examined, they answer Yea in word, and conceiue a negation, or No in their mindes. A practise most impious, and flat against this excellent Rule of the Prophet, that a man should sweare in truth, iudgement, & iustice. The Second Rule is, That the forme in which the oath is propounded, must be a plaine, simple, and direct forme, wherein God is directly called to witnesse. For his worship is directly to be giuen to him: and therefore the oath also, beeing an Inuocati∣on of his name, and a part of his worship, is directly to be made. That the meaning of this Rule, may the better appeare, one Question is to be answe∣red; Whether in the Forme of an oath, a man may not sweare, directly by creatures, and
indirectly by God? Most of the Popish sort, and some Prote∣stants hold, that he may. But the truth is o∣therwise. I say vnto you (saies our Sauiour) sweare not at all: neither by heauen—nor by the earth—nor by thy head, &c. Matth. 5. 34. In which words, he forbids all indirect oathes, whereby men sweare directly by creatures, and indirectly by God: for so did the Pha∣risies. Againe, if a man might sweare by creatures, and conceale the name of God, it would diminish his Maiestie and authoritie, and much deceit might be vsed: for the swearer might say, that he sware not, but on∣ly vsed an obtestation. Against this it is obiected. I. That Ioseph sware by the life of Pharaoh, Gen. 42. 25. therefore it may seeme, that oathes by crea∣tures are not vnlawfull. Ans. First, it may be said, that Ioseph sinned in so swearing: for therein he imitated the Egyptians, who sware by the life of their King. Secondly, it may be answered, that Ioseph doth onely make an asseueration, and not an oath. Obiect. II. The Church in the Canticles takes an oath, by the Creatures. Cant. 2. 7. I charge you, daughters of Ierusalem, by the roes, and by the hinds of the field, &c. Ans. It is no oath, but an obtestation, wherby the Church calls the creatures, to witnesse her earnest affection to Christ. The like is made by Mo∣ses, De. 30. 19. when he saith, I call heauen
and earth to record against you this day. And by Paul, in his charge to Timothie, 1. Tim. 5. 21. I charge thee, before the elect Angels. In which, and the like speeches, there is no swearing, but a kind of citation, or summoning of the Creatures as witnesses. And there is great difference betweene an oath, and an obtestati∣on. In the Obtestation, there is no more, but a calling of the creature to giue testimonie, the matter beeing already apparent and ma∣nifest. But in an Oath, where the matter is not so manifest, God is made not onely a witnesse, but also a iudge and reuenger. Obiect. III. Saint Paul sweares by his re∣ioycing in Christ, 1. Cor. 15. 31. which reioy∣cing was a created passion, or a creature. Ans. That was also an obtestation, or a word of auouchment, and asseueration; and not an oath. For it is all one, as if he had said thus; My sorrowes and afflictions, which I indure for Christ, would testifie (if they could speak) that as certenly as I reioyce in Christ, so certenly I die daily. Obiect. IV. Abigail sware to Dauid by the creature; As the Lord liueth, and as thy soule liueth, 1. Sam. 25. 26. Ans. The former part of her speech, may be called an oath, but the latter is onely an obtestation, or ear∣nest auouchment, ioyned with an oath. Now, although it be in no sort, lawfull to sweare by creatures, yet when a man swea∣reth directly by God, he may name the crea∣tures
in way and forme of an oath; specially if he make them as his pawnes, and pledges, set before God, that he may in iustice, be re∣uenged vpon him in them, if he lieth and sweareth not a truth. Sect. 3. III. Question. How farre-forth doth an Oath binde, and is to be kept? The answere to this Question is large, and When an oath bindes? therefore for orders sake I distinguish it into two parts, and first I will shew when an oath bindes, secondly when it bindeth not. For the first; An Oathe taken of things cer∣taine, lawfull, and possible, is to be kept, yea and bindes alwaies, though it bee tendred even to our enemies; To this purpose God hath giuē special Commandemēnt in sundry places. Numbers. 30. 3. Whosoeuer sweareth an oath, to bind his soule by a bond, he shall not break his word, but shall doe, according to all that pro∣ceeds out of his mouth: Mat. 5. 33. Thou shalt not forswear thy selfe, but shalt performe thine oathes vnto the Lord: Exod, 20. 7. Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vaine; that is, lightly and rashly. But Gods name is taken in vain, when an oathe made of things law∣full and possible is not kept; Dauid, at the humble request of Shimei, (who had before
cursed him) pardons his fault for the time, & sweares to him that he should not die, 2. Sam. 19. 23. Dauid made conscience of this oathe, knowing himselfe to be bound thereby, and therefore till his death he kept it; onely hee charged Solomon not to count him inno∣cent. 1. King. 2. 9. Now for the better clearing of the an∣swer, we are to consider four particular cases touching this point. I. Case. What if a man take an oath by false Gods, whether is he bound to keepe it, yea or no? Ans. He is, and the reasons are these; First from the like. There was a question among the Scribes and Pharises, Matt. 23. 16. whe∣ther a man swearing by the creature were a debter or no? The Pharisees taught, that if a man sware by creatures, the oathe did not binde; But Christ vers. 20. affirmeth, that he that sweares by the Temple, or by the Altar or by heauen, sweares by God indirectly, & so takes an oathe, though not a lawfull oath; and thereupon remaines bound, and is a debter; now by propotion he that sweares by false Gods, sweares by God indirectly, because the false God is, in the opinion of him that sweares, a true God, and so his oath bindeth, and is to be kept. Secondly, Abra∣ham accepts the oathe that Abimelech tendreth vnto him in the name of a false God, Gen. 21. 23 So doth Iacob accept of the
oathe made vnto him by Laban, Gen. 31. 53. which they would not haue done, if their oathes had not beene sufficient bondes, to binde them to obseruation, and perfor∣mance. It will be said; He that admits of an oathe by an Idoll, doth communicate in the sinne of him that sweareth. Ans. In case of necessi∣tie, a man may admitte of such an oath, with∣out sinne. A poore man, beeing in extreame want, borroweth of an vsurer vpon interest. It is sinne to the vsurer to take it; but it is not so in the poore man, who is compelled by the vsurer to giue interest: Thus the poore man doth vse well the iniquitio of the vsu∣rer: So it is in an oath; A Godly man may well vse, and take benefite by the wicked oathes of Idolaters, so farre forth as they shall serue for the ratifying, and confirming of lawfull couenants. II. Case. If a man take an oathe, and after∣ward endure hurt or dammage by it, whe∣ther is he then bound to keepe his oath or no? Ans. If the losse he but temporary and pri∣uate, (the oath beeing made of a thing law∣full) it must be indured. For Dauid reckoneth it among the properties of a good man, That he sweareth, and changeth not, though it be to his hurt, Psal. 15. 4. And here a difference is to be made be∣tweene a promissorie oath, and a single promise.
A single promise may be reversed by the will, and consent of him, to whom it is made; but a promise made by an oath, is to be kept, though losses and hinderances ensue therevpon. For the reuerence we beare to the name of God vsed in the oathe, ought to be of greater force with vs, then any priuate hinderance or inconueniēce, which may be∣fall vs, vpon the performance of the same. III. Case. Whether doth an oath binde conscience, whereunto a man is drawne, by fraud and subtiltie? Ans. If the oath be of things lawfull and possible, it bindeth and is to be kept, though we were induced to it by deceit. Ioshua de∣ceiued by the Gibeonites, was brought to make Couenant of peace with them, and to bind it by an oath: Now perceiuing after three daies, that they had wrought it by craft, he would not touch them, in reuerence of the oath, that he had taken. Iosh. 9. 18, 19, 20. And about 300 years after, whē Saul had slaine certaine of the Gibeonites, the Israe∣lites for that fact, were punished with three yeares famine; which could not be staied, till seauen persons of Sauls house were hanged vp in Gibeah. 2. Sam. 21. IV. Case. What if a man take an oath by feare and compulsion, is he to keepe it, yea or no? For example. A man falling into the hands of theeues, for the safetie of his life, is vrged to take a solemne oath, that he will
fetch and deliuer them some portion of mo∣ney, and withall neuer disclose the parties. The oath beeing thus taken, the Question is, whether he be bound to keepe it? Ans. Some Diuines are of opinion, that the oath is to be kept, and some say no: but generally it is answered, that it must be kept, because this feare did, not abolish the con∣sent of his will. But if it be alleadged, that in so doing, he shall hurt the Common-wealth: Answer is made, that if he doe not sweare se∣crecie, he may in probabilitie bring greater damage to the weale publike, in depriuing it of a member, by the losse of his owne life. But it will be saide, by this meanes he main∣taines a theefe. Ans. Be it so: yet he re∣maines excusable, because that was not his intent, but onely to preserue his owne life, to the good of the Common-wealth. Thus the most and best Diuines doe hold. But for my part, I leaue it in suspense; though it seemes in likelihood that the partie which sweares silence, doth after a sort maintaine theft, and communicate with the sinne of the robber: and further giues occasion, that others may fall into the like hazard and ieo∣pardie of their liues. And so much of the first part of the Answer. The second part of the Answer to this third maine Question followes: namely to VVhen an Oath bindes not? shew, when an oath bindes not. An oath doth not binde in sixe Cases.
I. When it is against the word of God, and tends to the maintenance of sinne. The reason is, because when God will not haue an oath to bind it must not bind: For an oath must not be a bond of iniquitie. Hereupon Dauid hauing sworne a rash oath, to destroy Nabal and his house, and beeing staied from it by the Lord in the meanes of Abigail; he praiseth God in this manner: Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, which sent thee this day to meete me, and blessed be thy counsell, and blessed be thou, which hast kept me this day, from cōming to shed blood. 1. Sam. 25. 32, 33. II. If it be made against the wholesome lawes of the Commonwealth; because euery soule must be subiect to the higher powers. Rom. 13. 1. III. If it be taken of such persons, as want reason; as of children, mad-men, or fooles; because they know not what they sweare: and there can be no binding of Conscience, when he that sweareth wanteth reason to discerne what he doth. IV. If it be made by those, who are vnder the tuition of their superiours, and haue no power to binde themselues; as by children which are vnder the gouernment of their Parents: For these are part of their parents goods, and therefore not fit to vndertake an oath, without their consent. Neither are they to choose a calling, or make any contract of themselues, but onely by the direction and
aduise of their parents; though some of the Popish sort do erroniously teach, that a child may binde himselfe by oath, to become a Monke of this or that order, without Con∣sent of Parents. V. If it be made of things impossible: for then it is a vaine oath. VI. If at the first it were lawfull, and af∣terward become impossible and vnlawfull. For such oathes God himselfe may be said to reuerse. Thus if a man bind himselfe by oath to liue in single life without marriage, and after findes that God-hath not giuen him the gift of continencie; in this case, his oath becomes impossible to be kept, and there∣fore beeing reversed by God, and becōming vnlawful, it may be broken without impiety. To these sixe, the Papists adde two other. The first, when the oathe is made vpon cu∣stome. And they put this example; If two men going out of a dore or ouer a bridge, the one sweares by God that he will not goe first; likewise sweares the other: yet at the last after contention, one of them goes first. In this case, saies the Papist, the othe bindes not. Ans. Custome cannot make that, which is sinne, to be no sinne, or periurie, to be no periurie: but rather doubles the sinn, & makes it aboue measure morevile & abhominable: and they that giue themselues to this vsuall, and customable swearing, cannot but often∣times become guiltie of flat periurie.
The Second Case is, when the Superiour power, that is, the Pope, or other inferiour Bishops, giue order to the contrarie, by re∣laxation or dispensation. Ans. It is falfe. For in euery lawful oath there is a double bond; one of man to man, the other of mā to God. Now if in the oath taken, man were onely obliged to man, the oath might be dispense∣able by man: But seeing man, when he swea∣reth to man, sweareth also to God, and ther∣by is immediately bound to God himselfe; hence it followeth, that an oath taken, can∣not haue release from any creature. There∣fore our Sauiour Christs commandement is, Thou shalt not forsweare thy selfe, but shalt per∣forme thy oathes, to whome? to the Lord. Math. 5. 33. And the oath that passed betweene Dauid and Ionathan, is called The Lords oath, 2. Sam. 21. 7 and 1. Sam. 20. 8. God will haue the oath to binde, as long as seemeth good vnto him; yea and cease binding, when it pleaseth him. And that which himselfe bindeth, or will haue to be bound, no crea∣ture can loose; The things which God hath cou∣pled, let no man separate. Math. 19. 6. And here∣in the Pope shewes himselfe to be Anti∣christ, in that he challengeth power to dis∣pense with a lawfull oath, made without er∣ror or deceit, of things honest and possible. Out of this answer, another Question may be resolued; namely, when doth a man com∣mit Periurie?
Ans. 1. When a man sweares that which he knowes to be false. 2. When he sweares that, which he meanes not to doe. 3. When he swearing to doe a thing, which he also meanes to doe, yet afterwards doth it not. In these three, the not performing of an oath made, it flat periurie. That we may yet be informed, concerning the sinne of Periurie, one Question of mo∣ment is to be skanned. In Societies & Cor∣porations, there be Lawes and Orders; to the keeping whereof, euery one admitted to an office, takes a corporall oath: Afterward it falls out vpon occasion, that he breakes some of the saide Statutes: The Question is, whether he be not in this case periured? Ans. Statues are of two sorts. Some are principall or fundamentall, which serue to maintaine the state of that bodie or Corpo∣ration. Others lesse principall, or mixt, that serue for order or decencie. In the statutes principall, the lawmaker intends obedience simply; and therefore they are necessarie to be kept. But in the lesse principall, he exacts not obedience simply, but either obedience, or the penaltie; because the penaltie is as much beneficiall to the state of that body, as the other. The breach of the former makes a man guilty of periurie; but it is otherwise in the latter, so be it the delinquent party be content to beare the mulct if it be impo∣sed. Thus, students and others belonging to
such societies, may in some sort excuse them∣selues, from the sinne of periurie, though not from all fault, in breaking some of the lesser locall statutes, els few could liue in any soci∣etie without periurie. Yet one more Question is propounded touching periurie, whether a man may exact an oath of him, whome he feares or knowes will forsweare himselfe. Ans. A priuate man must not; but a Magistrate may, if the partie offer to take his oath, (not beeing vrged therto,) and be first admonished of the grei∣vousnesse of the said sinne of periurie. In the execution of Ciuil Iustice, Magistrates must not stay vpon mens sinnes: Moses expected not the Israelites repentance, for their Ido∣latrie; but presently proceeded vnto punish∣ment. Neither must the publicke good of the Common wealth bee hindred, vpon the likelyhood or suspition of a mans periu∣rie.
CHAP. XIIII. Of Vowes. THe Seuenth head of the Out∣ward worship of God, is con∣cerning a vowe. All the Que∣stions whereof may be redu∣ced to these foure. I. Question. What is a Vowe? Ans. A Vowe, is a promise made to God of things lawfull and possible. I call it a pro∣mise, to distinguish a vowe from a single pur∣pose. For a purpose may be chaunged, but a vowe lawfully made cannot. Againe, there is great difference betweene these two: for in a vowe, there is first, a purpose to doe a thing: secondly, a binding of our selues to doe that we pupose. For this cause I tearme it a promise, because it is a purpose with a bond, without which there can be no vowe made. In the next place I adde, a promise made to God; not to Saint, Angel, or Man. The rea∣sons are these. First, a vowe is properly the worke of the heart, consisting in a purpose. Now God alone knowes the heart, and he
alone is able, to discerne of the purpose and intent of the same which no Angel, Saint, or other creature can possible doe. Secondly, when the vow is made, none can punish and take revenge of the breach therof, but God. Thirdly, in the old Testament, the Iewes ne∣uer vowed, but to God; because the vowe was a part of Gods worshippe: Deut. 23. 21. When thou shalt vowe a vowe vnto the Lord thy God, thou shalt not bestack to pay it; for the Lord thy God, will surely require it of thee, and so it should be sinne vnto thee. Where by the way, we may take notice, of the superstition of the popish Church, that maketh vowes to Saints and Angels, which is in effect to make thē gods, & to worship thē as the Iewes worshipped God in the old Testament. II. Question. Whether a vowe, be now in the newe Testament, any part of Religion, or Gods worship? The answere is threefold. First, if a vowe be taken for a promise of morall obedience; the answer is, that a vowe is indeed the worship of God, and so shal be, to the ende of the world. For as God (for his part) promiseth mercie, in the couenant of grace, so wee in Baptisme, doe make a vowe, and promise of obedience to him, in all his commandements; and therefore Peter cal∣leth
Baptisme a stipulation, that is, the pro∣mise of good conscience to God. This pro∣mise once made in Baptisme, is renewed so oft as we come to the Lords Supper, and fur∣ther continued in the daily spirituall exerci∣ses of Invocation, and Repentance. But it may be said, we are already bound to the obedience of the Law by order of di∣uine Iustice; therefore we cannot further binde our selues. Ans. He that is bound by God, may also bind himself. Dauid though he was boūd by god in conscience, to keepe the Law, yet he binds himselfe freely by oath, to helpe his own weaknes, & to keepe himselfe from falling, when he saith, I haue sworne, and will performe it, that I will keepe thy righteous iudgements, Psal. 119. 106. And the same bond is no lesse necessary and behooffefull for vs, if we consider how prone and readie we are to fall from the worshippe of God. The second Answere. If a vowe be taken for a promise of some ceremoniall dutie, as of Sacrifices and Oblations, or of giuing house, lands, and goods to the Temple; then we must put a difference betweene the Olde Testament and the New. In the Old Testa∣ment, the vow of such duties, was part of Gods worshippe; but in the Newe it is not, and that for these Reasons. First, The Iewish ceremonies were to the Iewes, a part of Gods worshippe, but to vs Gentiles they are not; cōsidering they are all
in Christ abolished, and none of them doe now stand in force by Gods Law to vs. Thus the Passeover was a ceremonie, or seruice, ap∣pointed by God to be obserued of the Israe∣lites and their posteritie, Exod. 12. 24. 25. and therefore stood as a part of Gods wor∣shippe to them for a perpetuall ordinance. But to vs in the new testament, both it and other Legall ceremonies are abrogated, and we haue onely two Sacraments to be admi∣nistred and receiued, as seales of the Promi∣ses of God, and parts of his worshippe, Bap∣tisme, and the Supper of the Lord. Secondly, that which is not commended vnto vs by God, in the name of worshippe, is no worshippe to vs. Now, the ceremonies of the Iewes, are no where commended vnto vs in that name; and therefore it is a vaine thing for any man to vowe the obseruation thereof. Thirdly, vowes of ceremoniall duties, did, in a peculiar manner, and vpon speciall re∣spects, pertaine to the Iewes. Hereupon, when they vowed House, Lands, Goods, &c. to the vse of the Temple, this they did, as beeing the Lords Tenants, of whome alone they helde their possessions: and hereby they ac∣knowledged and also testified their Homa∣ges and Seruices due vnto him. And this particular respect concerneth not the Church and people of the New Testament: whence it followeth, that they are not tyed
by the same bond, to performe worship vn∣to God, by the vowes of Ceremonies, gifts, oblations, and sacrifices. The third and last part of the Answer. If a vowe be taken for a promise, of some bodi∣ly and outward worke, or exercise; as fasting, giuing of almes, abstaining from certaine meates and drinkes, &c. then it is not any part of Gods worship, but onely an helpe, stay, and furtherance of the same. For first, we haue libertie of conscience in Christ, to vse or not to vse, all indifferent things. Now Gods worship is not a thing of that nature, but absolutely necessarie. Secondly, Paul, 1. Tim. 4. 8. affirmeth, that bodily exercise profiteth little, but godlines is profitable for all things: In which words, he opposeth godlines to bodi∣ly exercise, and therefore godlines, or the worship of God, consisteth not in them. But the words of Dauid are alleadged to the contrarie, Psal. 76. 11. Vowe and performe vnto the Lord your God. Where we haue a dou∣ble command, one to make Vowes, another to pay them. To which I answer: first, if Da∣uid speaketh of the vowe of all moral duties, then the Commandement concerneth euery man; because the thing commanded, is a part of Gods worship. For it is as much as if he had said, Vow thankefull obedience vnto God, and performe it. Againe, if the place be meant, of the vow of ceremoniall duties, then it is a commandement peculiar to the
old Testament, and so bindes the Iewes one∣ly: howbeit not all of them, but onely such as had iust cause to make a vow: for other∣wise they had libertie to abstaine from vow∣ing, Deut. 23. 22. When thou abstainest from vowing, it shall be no sinne vnto thee. Of one of these two kinds, must the place alleadged necessarily be vnderstoode, and not of the third, which is of bodily exercise: for then it should reuerse Christian libertie in the vse of things indifferent, which no Commande∣ment can doe. By light of this Answer, we may discerne the errour of the Popish Church, which ma∣keth Vowes a part of Religion, and the Wor∣ship of God. Nay further, it teacheth that some vowes, as namely those of Pouertie, Continencie, Regular Obedience to this or that Order, are workes of merit and supere∣rogation, tending to a state of perfection, e∣uen in this life; and deseruing a further de∣gree of glorie in heauen, then the worke of the Morall Law. III. Question. When a Uow made, doth binde, and when not? Before I giue answer to the Question, I will lay downe this Ground. In making of a lawfull Vow, foure Condi∣tions are to be obserued.
The first, concerneth the person of him that voweth; that he be a fit person. His fit∣nesse may be discerned by two things. First, if he be at his owne libertie, (as touching the things whereof he makes his vow,) and not vnder the gouernment of a superiour. Thus in the Old Testament, if a daughter had made a vow, without the consent or allow∣ance of her father, it might not stand in ef∣fect. Numb. 30. 4, 5. Secondly, if the partie keepe himselfe within the compasse of his calling generall and particular. Hence it fol∣lowes, that Vowes of going a Pilgrimage, to worship this or that Idol, in this or that place, (for example, S. Iames of Compostella, and the Ladie of Loretto, &c.) are vtterly vnlawfull; because such persons, by this practise, doe leaue their calling and condition of life, and take vpon them a calling, not warranted by the Lord. The second Condition is, concerning the Matter of a Vow. It must be Lawfull, Possi∣ble, and Acceptable to God. Hereupon it followes, that there be foure things, which cannot be the matter of a Vow. The first, is Sinne. Thus the Iewes bound themselues with a Vow, that they would neither eate, nor drinke, till they had killed Paul, Act. 23. 12, 14. This their vow was nothing els, but a threat∣ning of God himselfe: and therefore vtterly vnlawfull. Secondly, Trifles, and light mat∣ters; as, when a man voweth, not to take vp
a straw, or such like. And this is a plaine mocking of God. Thirdly, things impossi∣ble; as to flie, or to go on foote to Ierusalem. Fourthly, things meerely necessarie; as to die, which cannot be auoided. The Third, is touching the Forme of a Vowe. It must be voluntarie, and free. And that it may be so, three things are necessarily required. First, that it be made in Iudgement, that is, with reason and deliberation. Next, that it be done with consent of will. And thirdly, with libertie of conscience. Hence it appeares, that the Vowes of chil∣dren, mad-men, and fooles, or such as are ta∣ken vpon rashnes, or constraint; also the vow of perpetuall abstinence from things simply indifferent, are all vtterly vnlawfull. For, the first sort are not done vpon iudgement, the next without due consideration, and the last are greatly preiudiciall to Christian liber∣tie. The fourth concernes the Ende; which is, not to be a part of Gods worship, but onely a stay and proppe to further and helpe vs in the same. Nowe there be three particular Ends of a vow. First, to shew our selues thāk∣full to God for blessings receiued: secondly, to preuent sinne to come, by keeping so brie∣tie and moderation: thirdly, to preserue and increase our faith, prayer, repentance, and o∣bedience. This Ground beeing laide, the Answer to
the Question propounded is this. When in vowing, we obserue the conditions prae-re∣quired, the vow is lawfull, and consequently binds the partie vowing, so as if he keepe it not, he dishonoureth God. But when the saide Conditions, doe not concurre in the a∣ction of vowing, it becomes vnlawfull, and the partie remaineth free, and not bound to performance. Here by the way, a Question of some mo∣ment is made; Whether Iephte vpon his Vow, did offer his Daughter in Sacrifice or no? considering that it is plaine, euen by the light of Nature, as also by the doctrine be∣fore taught, that a man is bound by the vow which he maketh. This Question admitteth sundrie answers, according to the diuers opinions and iudge∣ments of men, vpon the place written, Iudg. 11. And my purpose is not to examine that which others haue brought in way of resolu∣tion, but briefly to deliuer that which I take to be the truth. I answer therefore that Ieph∣te did not offer his Daughter in Sacrifice vp∣on his vowe; but onely dedicated her vnto God, after the manner of the Nazarites, to the ende of her daies; to lead her life apart in a single estate. The truth of this answer will appeare by these reasons. First, in the 37. verse of the chapter, the daughter of Iephte craues leaue of her fa∣ther, to goe apart into the mountaines, for
two moneths space, to bewaile her virgini∣tie. Where it may be obserued, that she went not to deplore the losse of her life, but her future estate and condition, because shee was (vpō her fathers vow) to liue a perpetuall sin∣gle life. And why? surely, because (as the text saith, vers. 39.) she had not knowne a man; & it was accounted a curse in Iudea, for a wo∣man alwaies to liue vnmarried. Secondly, in the last verse it is said in our common English translation, that the daugh∣ters of Israel went yeare by yeare, to lament the daughter of Iephte: But I take it, it may be as well, or better translated out of the He∣brue, they went to Le-thannoth So it is ex∣pounded by the Hebrewe Doctors. Quintil. in Iud. 11. 40. talke or conferre with her, and so to comfort her: and that this interpretati∣on may not, seeme strange, the very same word is obserued in this sense, Iudg. 5. 11. there shall they Iethannu. talke or conferre of the righ∣teousnesse of the Lord. Now if they went yeare by yeare to comfort her, then shee was not put to death. Thirdly, Iephte is commended by the holy Ghost, for the excellencie of his faith, Heb. 11. 32. and that out of the same historie. Now the commendation of his faith, and the vn∣naturall murther of his daughter, cannot stand together. But it will be said, that Iephte vowed, that whatsoeuer came out of his dores to meete him should be the Lords, & he would offer it for a burnt offring, v. 31. Ans. The words may
more truly be read thus; or I will offer it in sa∣crifice. And the meaning of the vowe was this: That thing which first meeteth me, if it be a thing to be sacrificed, I will sacrifice it: if not. I will dedicate it to the Lord. For it seems to consist of two parts, wherof the lat∣ter is coupled to the former, by a discretiue coniunctiō, as the Grāmarians speake. In this manner, the word is els where taken, so as it may either way be expounded. In the fourth commandement, Exod. 20. 10. in our com∣mon translation it is read, thou and thy sonne, and thy daughter, but out of the Ebrwe, it may be translated either and, or or. It will be said againe, that Iephte rent his cloathes, because his daughter mette him, when he returned from the victorie. Ans. That was in regard of her vowed virginitie: which was a curse among the Iewes. And besides, he had but one daughter, and by this meanes of sacrifing her all hope of poste∣ritie after him was cut off. But it seemes, that Monasticall vowes of virginitie, by this example are lawfull. Ans. Indeed the custome of vowing virginitie be∣ganne in those dayes, but they thought it not a state of perfection, but rather an estate of miserie, as may appeare, in that he rent his cloaths, when she mette him, and the daugh∣ters of Israel went to comfort her, as being now in a woefull and miserable estate. Vpon these Reasons, I conclude, that
Iephte did not offer vp his daughter in sa∣crifice, but onely set her apart, to liue a single life, to the honour and seruice of God. And Iephte might knowe euen by the light of nature, that it was a finne to vow h daugh∣ters death, and a double sinne to kill her. IV. Question. Whether Monasticall, or Monkish vowes binde or no? To this the Papists answer affirmatiuely, placing the greatest part of their Religion, in practise and observance of these vowes. That we may know them the better, they are in number three. The first is, the vowe of continency, whereby a man renounceth Ma∣riage for euer, and voweth vnto God perpe∣tuall virginitie. The second, of Voluntarie Povertie, which is, when a man giueth ouer all propertie of his goods, and bindes him∣selfe to liue by begging. The third is, of Re∣gular obedience, when a man resignes him∣selfe in conscience, to be ruled by another, and to keepe some deuised order, in all acti∣ons and duties pertaining to religion. Now the Question beeing, whether these vowes binde or no? I answer in a word, they doe not, and that for these reasons. I. First, they are flat against the law of God, which I make manifest in the particu∣lars.
The vowe of perpetuall chastitie, is ex∣pressely against Gods commandement. 1. Cor. 7. 9. If they cannot abstaine, let them marry: for it is better to marrie then to burne. To this text the Papists answer, three waies. First they say, that this place of scripture, is onely a diuine permission, and not a com∣mandement: we reply againe directly, that it is a plaine commandement: For the intent of the Holy Ghost in that text, and in the whole Chapter is, to ordaine a necessarie remedie for incontinencie, which Paul calls burning, and for the auoiding of fornication, which brings destructiō to the soule. And for that purpose, he speaks not in permitting mā∣ner, but in imperatiue tearmes, Let thē marry. Secondly, they answer, that the words concerne onely incontinent persons, that commit fornication. We on the other side affirme, that they are not only giuen to them that liue incontinently, but to all persons, which are subiect to burning, which burning may be without incontinencie. For the better vnderstanding whereof, let it be considered, that there be three distinct degrees of lust in man. The first is, when the temptatiō is first receiued into the mind. The secōd, when the same temptation preuaileth, though with some resistāce & trouble of the minde & conscience, which also (though no outward offence as yet follow) is a degree of burning. The third is, whē the temptation so
far preuaileth, that the heart & will are over∣come, and the duties of religion for the time vtterly hindred: This is the highest and worst kind of burning. And if we consider these degrees well, it will easily appeare, that there may be burning without incontinent liuing. Thirdly, they answere; that this text spea∣keth not of persons that are free, but of those alone, who are bound from Mariage by solemne vow: we contrariwise affirme and hold, that the words are generall, and plain∣ly directed to all persons, bound by vowe or otherwise; and that appeares by vers. 5. where he saies, I speake not this to tangle you in a snare. These words doe shewe, that Pauls mind was, touching the vow of perpetuall virginitie. For he leaues euery man accor∣ding to Gods ordinance, to his owne liber∣tie, willing none by vowe to binde himselfe from the vse thereof. Now for the vow of Regular Obedience, that also is against the word of God. 1. Cor. 7. 27. Ye are bought with a price, be not the ser∣uants of men. Where the Apostle forbiddes vs, to subiect our hearts and consciences, to the lawes and ordinances of men, in matters of Religion; and consequently ouerthrow∣eth the vowe of Regular obedience. For in that a man bindes himselfe to be ruled (in all things belonging to Gods worship) accor∣ding to the will and pleasure of his Superi∣or, yea to eate, drinke, sleepe; to be cloathed.
&c. according to a certaine rule giuen and prescribed by him; whereas in regard of con∣science we are bound onely vnto God. Lastly, the vowe of voluntarie Pouertie, is also a plaine abuse of Gods owne ordinance and appointment, Deut. 15. 4. that there should be no begger in Israel. But it may seeme, that this law is not per∣petuall. For in the New Testament we read, that there were beggers, as namely one, that was laide at the gate of the Temple, daily to aske almes, Act. 3. Ans. This Law neither was then, nor is now abrogated by God, but the obseruation of it (at that time, and since) was much neglected. And the neglect of prouision for the poore, is the cause of beg∣ging; and the vowe of perpetuall pouertie, still remaines as a manifest breach of Gods holy ordinance, notwithstanding any thing that may be pretended to the contrarie. II. The second reason followes. Monkish vowes, as they are against Gods commande∣ment, so are they also against the Libertie of Conscience, which we haue by Christ touch∣ing the vse of the creatures, and ordinances of God: as riches, mariages, meates, drinkes, and apparell. Stand fast, saith the Apostle, in the libertie wherewith Christ hath made you free, Gal. 5. 1. Againe, Let no man iudge you in meat, or in drinke, or inrespect of an holy day, Coloss. 2. 16. In these places, there is granted vnto man, a free vse of all things indifferent, so it
be not in case of offence. Now in Monkish vowes, those things which God hath made indifferent, and put in our libertie, are made necessarie: whereas no ordinance of man, can make things simply necessarie, and parts of Gods worship, which he himselfe hath made indifferent, and left free to the will of man. And hence it was that the forbidding of meates and mariage, were tearmed by the Apostle, The doctrine of Deuills, 1. Tim. 4. 1. But (will some say) doth not the ciuill Magistrate in our Common-wealth, forbid the vse of some meates? Ans. He doth. But by his commandement he takes not away the libertie that we haue in the vse of things indifferent, but doth onely moderate it, for the common good, which he may doe law∣fully. III. The third reason. Some of them are out of the power and abilitie of him that voweth; as the vowe of perpetuall chastitie in single life. For our Sauiour saith, All men cannot receiue this word, but they to whome it is giuen, Matth. 19. 11. that is, Continencie is a gift of God, whereof all men are not capa∣ble, but those onely to whome he giueth it, when, and as long as it pleaseth him; neither is it denied vnto some, because they wil not, but because they are not able. Against this, the Papist obiecteth, that we may receiue any good gift of God, if we
pray for it: for Christ hath saide, Aske, and ye shall receiue, Matth. 7. 7. Ans. It is false. Gods gifts are of two sorts. Some are common to all that beleeue, and necessarie to saluation; as Faith, Repentance, Obedience, the Feare of God. Some againe are speciall gifts, not giuen to all, nor needs full to saluation, but peculiar onely to some; as health, wealth, continen∣cie, single life, &c. Now the promise of our Sauiour, Aske, and ye shall receiue, is meant of things necessarie to saluation, and not of par∣ticular and speciall gifts. For some may pray for them, and yet neuer receiue them. Thus Paul praied thrise, that the pricke in his flesh, the messenger of Satan, might be remooued from him, yet he was not heard, nor his peti∣tion graunted. And why? Because that which he prayed for, was not a common gift necessarie to saluation, but a speciall grace, for the time of the temptation, wherewith he was pre∣sently assaulted; whereupon Answer was gi∣uen, My grace is sufficient for thee. And hence we learne, in what manner, to aske things at the hands of God, when wee pray. Such as are necessarie to saluation, we may aske absolutely and simply; but things that are lesse necessarie, with this condition; If it may stand with the good will and plea∣sure of God. Againe, the Papist alleadgeth an example of two married persons; the one whereof beeing smitten by the hand of God with the
dead palsie, the other must needes pray for the gift of continencie. Ans. In this case a married partie may aske it, and by Gods mercy obtaine it, because now there remains vnto him or her no other remedie. But it is not so with single persons, considering that they haue an other remedie, which is Mari∣age: and therefore they may not looke, or hope to obtaine such a gift. Thirdly, they say, God hath giuen to all men sufficient aide and strength, that if they will vse the meanes, they may haue the gift of chastitie. For sufficient grace is giuen to all, though not effectuall. Ans. It is false: there is neither sufficient, nor effectuall grace giuen to all, to liue a single life; but it is a rare and speciall gift giuen onely to some. Paul to Timothie, willeth younger women, not to indeauour to forbeare, when they haue not the gift, but in want thereof to marrie, 1. Tim. 5. 14. Where he takes it for graunted, that they had no such power giuen them of God, to liue in perpetuall chastitie, though they would. IV. The fourth Reason. Popish vowes doe abolish that order, which God hath set in the Societie of mankinde, to wit, that men should not onely serue him in the duties of the first Table, out in the duties of the se∣cond, by seruing of men, Gal. 5. 13. By loue serue one another. Againe, Rom. 13. 10. Loue is called the fulfilling of the Law; because the
law of God is practised, not apart by it selfe, but in and with the loue of our neighbour. From this order it followeth, that euery man, beside the Generall calling of a Christian, must haue some particular kinde of life, in the which he must walke, and therein doe seruice to men: Which if he refuse to doe, he must not eate, according to the Apostles rule, 2. Thess. 3. 10. Now these vowes make a separation be∣tweene these two: for they bring men into a generall calling, but they vtterly frustrate and make void the particular, and the duties of it; so as a man keeping them, cannot be seruiceable to man, either in Church or Com∣monwealth. Besides, by the vow of pouer∣tie, the Apostles rule is disanulled, 1. Tim. 5. 16. which is, that if a man be able to main∣taine himselfe, or haue any kinred able to doe it, he should not be chargeable to the Church; and so there might be sufficient almes to them that are truly poore. V. The fift Reason. They bring in againe Iudaisme: for Iewish religion by Gods ap∣pointment, stood in bodily rites, and out∣ward ceremonies, actions, and gestures, yea in outward things, as garments, meats, drinks. And their rule was, Touch not, tast not: from all which we are wholly freed by Christ. VI. Sixtly, these vowes are Idolatrous and superstitious: for they are made and ob∣serued with an opinion of Gods worship, of
merit, and of the state of perfection: whereas nothing can be made Gods worship, but that which himselfe commandeth. And bo∣dily exercises are vnprofitable, as Paul saith, and therefore they can not be meritorious. And further, to dreame of a state of perfecti∣on beyond the Law of God, is to make the Law it selfe imperfect: whereas contrariwise, the Law of the Lord is perfect, righteous, and pure, Psal. 19. 7, 8. VII. Lastly, these vowes are against the preseruation of Nature: for by them, special∣ly that of perpetuall chastitie, men are brought to destroy euen their owne bodies and liues, which they are bound to preserue and maintaine. Ephes. 5. 29. No man euer yet hated his owne flesh, but nourisheth and cherisheth it. The Apostle, euen in his daies, noted it as a fault, in the voluntarie religion, that was then taken vp by some; that for the mainte∣nance thereof, they spared not their owne bodies, Coloss. 2. 23. And like vnto that, is the practise of Popish Votaries, which tendeth to the ruine and ouerthrow of nature, and life it selfe. These be the Reasons. In the next place, we are to consider the Allegations that are commonly made, in the fauour and defence of Popish vowes. And first it is obiected: In the Old Testa∣ment, Vowes were a part of Gods worship: therfore they are so to be holdē in the New.
Ans. There is great difference betweene them. For first, they had their warrant out of Gods word; these haue not so: nay there be expresse testimonies of scripture against these Vowes. Secondly, in their vowes, there was al∣waies right reserued to superiours, to reuerse them, if they liked them not. But in Mona∣sticall vowes, all right is taken from superi∣ours. For children are permitted to vow; and their promises must stand against parents consent. And wiues (according to Popish doctrine) may vow, against the expresse con∣sent of their husbands. Thirdly, they were not perpetuall, but cea∣sed with the ceremoniall Law. But these are supposed to haue a perpetuall equitie, that must continue till the ende of the world. Secondly, they alleadge that which is written, Matth. 19. 12. Some haue made them∣selues chast for the kingdome of heauen. Ans. The meaning of the text is not, that some haue vowed single life, but that there are some, who beeing assured that they haue the gift of continencie, vpon that gift, doe en∣deauour to maintaine their present estate, that so they may the better serue God, and aduance his kingdome, both in themselues and others. Thirdly, they obiect, 1. Tim. 5. 12. where Paul speakes of certaine young women, which haue damnation, because they haue bro∣ken
their first faith: that is, (as they interpret it) their vow of single life. Ans. The words are not to be vnderstood, of the faith of the vowe; but either of that faith and promise, which was made to God in their Baptisme, or the faith and promise of seruice and re∣leefe to be performed to the poore; and for the breach of either of these, they may be said to incurre damnation. Fourthly, they say, Christ himselfe was a begger, and therefore why may not we also be beggers? Ans. Though Christ was poore, yet was he no begger. For he kept a familie, and had a treasure. Iudas was the steward of his familie, and bare the bagge, Ioh. 13. 29. Againe, there is mention made of 200 pence, Ioh. 6. 7. which in likelihood was in the bagg that Iudas kept: yea, of the money which he had, the Disciples are saide to buie meate, Ioh. 4. 8. And though it were graunted, that Christ was a begger, yet it followes not, that we should be so. For his pouertie was expia∣torie, and part of his sufferings. So saith the Apostle, He beeing rich, for our sakes became poore, that we through his pouertie might be made rich, 2. Cor. 8. 9. Fiftly, they alledge, that the Disciples for∣sooke all, and liued in pouertie; and their ex∣ample is propounded for our imitation. Ans. They forsooke all indeede, yet how? not for euer, but for a time; and that not by vowe, but onely in affection and disposition of their
hearts. For after they had forsaken all, we read, that they came to their nets and boates againe, Ioh. 21. 3. Againe, the Apostle Paul speakes of himselfe and the rest, when he saith, Haue we not power to lead about a wife bee∣ing a sister? 1. Cor. 9. 5. By which it is plaine, that they put not away their wiues. Sixtly, Mat. 19. 21. If thou wilt be perfite (saith Christ to the young man) goe, sell all that thou hast, and giue to the poore, and thou shalt haue treasure in heauen, and come and followe me. Here (saith the Papist) our Sauiour prescribes perpetuall pouertie, by expresse counsell. Ans. The words are no counsell, but a speciall Commandement of triall, directed to this yoūg man. And the ende of it was, to discouer vn∣to him, his secret pride, and hypocrisie, in that he boasted, that he had kept all the com∣mandements, when as indeed he knew not what they meant. Lastly, they obiect the example of the Re∣cabites, who according to the commande∣ment of their father Ion adab, would drinke no wine, nor dwell in houses, nor build, nor plant, nor sowe, Ierem. 35. and the Lord ap∣prooueth their practise. Ans. They did o∣bey their fathers command in these things, as beeing things indifferent, but not as parts of Gods worshippe in the doing where of they pla∣ced Religion. And they obeyed it carefully, for this ende, that they might inure them∣selues vnto hardshippe. Secondly, this their
obedience, touching these things, stood not by any vowe, much lesse was it perpetuall. For then they should haue obserued all the things which they vowed, equally, which they did not; for they dispensed with their fathers voluntarie iniunction for dwelling in Tents; and as we read vers. 11. They came vp, for feare of the Chaldeans, that were in the land, and dwelt at Ierusalem. And so much touching Popish Vowes, whereof to conclude, this may be said; That they are all, but a meere will-worship, stan∣ding vpon no ground or warrant of Gods word, and therefore of no force, to bind the consciences of men, but are to be holden, as they are in truth, wicked and abhomina∣ble.
CHAP. XV. Of Fasting. THe eight Head of the outward worship of God, is Fasting. By Fasting I vnderstand, the Religious Fast, which is ioy∣ned with the duties of Religi∣on; and namely, the exercises of Praier and Humiliation. Touching it, there are three principall Questions to be handled in their order. I. Question. What is a Religious Fast? Ans. It is a voluntary and extraordinary abstinence, taken vp for a religious end; what this end is, we shall see afterward. First, I call it voluntarie, because the time, and particular manner of Fasting, is not im∣posed, or determined, but left free to our owne liberty. Againe, I tearme it extraordi∣nary, to distinguish it from ordinary fasting; which stands in the practise of temperance and sobrietie; whereby the appetite is re∣strained, in the vse of meates and drinkes, that it doe not exceede moderation. Now this kinde of fast is to be vsed of all Christi∣ans, at all times; whereas the extraordinarie
is not dayly and ordinarily to be practised, but vpon speciall occasions, and at speciall times, in as much, as it is a more strait and severe abstinence then the other. II. Question. How a Religious Fast is to be obserued? Ans. For the obseruation of it, three things are required. I. A iust and weightie cause. II. A right manner. III. Right ends. Sect. 1. Fasting is then to be vsed, when a iust and The iust cause of a fash weightie cause or occasion therof is offered. There be two iust causes of a fast. The First is, when some iudgement of God hangs over our heads, whether it be publicke, as Famine, Pestilence, the Sword, destruction, &c. or priuate. The Prophet Io∣el in the name of the Lord, calls the Iewes to a strait and solemne fast; and that vpon this iust occasion, because the Lord had sent a great dearth vpon the land, Ioel 2. 14, 15, &c. Hester and her companie fasted, when shee had heard newes of the intended destructi∣on of the Iewes, Ester. 4. 16. The people of Nineueh, which were not Iewes, but forrei∣ners in regard of the Couenant, when the
Prophet came, and denounced destruction vn∣to them for their sinnes, they gaue them∣selues generally to fasting and praier. Ion. 3. 5. 8. The second cause of fasting is, when we are to sue, & seeke by prayer to God, for some speciall blessing, or for the supply of some great want. Thus, when Daniel desired to ob∣taine the deliuerance of the children of Isra∣el, out of captiuitie in Babylon, he gaue him∣selfe to fasting, Dan. 10. 3. Thus, Christ fasted, and spent the whole night in prayer vnto God, before he chose his twelue Apostles, Luk. 6. 12. And in like manner, Paul and Si∣las when they were to found and plant Churches, vsed praier and fasting, Act. 14. 23. because in these matters of so great impor∣tance, they looked for special direction from God himselfe. Lastly, Anna, that shee might be more feruent in praier, fasted night and day in the Temple, Luc. 2. 37. Sect. 2. The second point, is the Right manner of fasting, which stands in three things. The right manner of fa∣sting. The Frist is, Abstinence from meate and drinke: for therein consisteth the very nature of a fast; and if that be wanting, it is no fast at all. Thus Ester commanding the Iewes to fast for her, biddes them neither eate nor drinke for three daies, Ester. 4. 16. The Second is, an abstinence from all de∣lights,
which may any way cheare and re∣fresh nature. In this sort Daniel fasted three whole weekes of daies, abstaining from all pleasant bread, flesh, wine, and ointments, Dan. 10. 3. So when Dauid fasted, it is saide that he lay all the night vpon the earth, that he neither washed, nor annointed himselfe, nor changed his apparell, 2. Sam. 12. 16, 20. In the solemne fast of the Iewes, the bride∣grome and bride must come out of their cham∣bers, Ioe. 2. 15, 16. By these places it is manifest, that in a true fast, there is required, not onely abstinence from meate and drinke, but from all delights, recreations, & other things that might refresh the nature of man. By this the Popish Fasting is iustly reprooued; wherein, though men are inioyned to abstaine from flesh, yet there is giuen libertie to vse other delicates. The Third thing in the manner of a Fast, is, so farre forth to abstaine from meate, and other delights, as the bodie may be thereby afflicted. Ezra proclaimes a fast, and he giues a reason thereof, that himselfe and the peo∣ple might afflict themselues, Ezra 8. 2. This Af∣flicting of a mans selfe; is expoūded by Paul, 1. Cor. 9. 27. where he saith, I beate downe my bodie, and bring it in subiection. Now, though we must humble and afflict our bodies by fasting, yet we ought not to weaken, abo∣lish, or destroy nature; or doe that whereby the strength of nature may be taken away.
For such afflicting is forbidden, Coloss. 2. 23. And contrariwise, we are commanded by Christ, to pray for daily bread, that is, such food as is fitte to sustaine our substances; and therefore we may by such exercises, ouer∣throw the same. Yet for the better vnderstanding of the manner of Fasting, three Questions are to be answered. I. Question. How long the fast must con∣tinue? Ans. The beginning and ende of a Fast, is left vnto our libertie. But it is so long to be kept, as the principall actions of the fast, that is, humiliation and prayer, doe continue, And though the beginning and ende there∣of be free to vs, yet it is most meete & con∣uenient, that solemne fasts should beginne in the Morning, and last till the Euening. This was the vsuall custome of the Church in the old Testament. II. Question. Whether in the day of a solemne fast, a man may eate any thing or no? and if he may, what? and how often? Ans. We may eate, and that (if neede re∣quire) once or twise. Yet here we must take with vs two caueats. First, concerning the quantitie of our meate; it must be lesse then ordinarie, and onely that which is necessarie to proserue nature, and no more: for if it be otherwise, we abolish our fast. Secondly, concerning the qualitie of that we eate; it
must not be daintie and pleasant, but the meanest food, and such as hath least delight∣somnes and delicacie in it. Thus Daniel fa∣sted for three weekes of daies, from morning to euening: in which time he ate but a small quantitie of meate, and that which was none of the daintiest, Dan. 10. 3. These caueats obserued, a man may law∣fully take some sustenance, euen in the time of a solemne fast. For there is no kinde of meate but may then be eaten, quantitie and qualitie beeing obserued. In the old Testa∣ment, no cleane beast was forbidden to be eaten, in the day of a fast. And in the New, To the pure, saith Paul, Tit. 1. 15. all things are pure. And the kingdome of God, stands not in meates and drinkes, but in righteousnesse, peace, and ioy in the holy Ghost, Rom. 14. III. Quest. Whether all persons, are bound to keepe the forme prescribed, in the day of the solemne fast? Ans. All that are able, and can abstaine, are bound. Yet because Gods worshippe stands not in eating or not eating, some persons are here exempted. First, all those that are weake, as children, aged persons, and those that are sickely. Se∣condly, they that, by reason of the constituti∣on of their bodies, doe find themselues vnfit to pray, and heare the word cheerefully, when their stomacks are emptie. These per∣sons may eate in the day of a solemne fast, so
that they obserue the caueats before remem∣bred. It is not with vs in these countries, as it was with the Iews: They could fast one, two, or three daies together, without any incon∣venience; we cannot doe the like. And the reason is plaine. Men that liue in those hotte countries, haue colde stomackes, and so may fast the longer; but in colder climates, such as ours is, in respect of theirs; men beeing of hotter stomackes, are not able to continue fasting so long as they. Sect. 3. The third point is, concerning the Right The right ends of fa∣sting. endes of a religious fast; and they are foure. The first is, to subdue the flesh, that is, to bring the body, and so the bodily lusts into subiection to the will and word of God. By eating and drinking, the body is made hea∣uie, the heart oppressed, the senses dull; and the whole man vnfit for the duties of humi∣liation, praier, and hearing of the word, Luk. 21. 24. That therfore this vnfitnesse may be taken away, not onely the body it selfe, but the vnruely lusts of the flesh are to be morti∣fied and subdued, by this exercise of fa∣sting. The second end is, to stirre vp our deuo∣tion, and to confirme the attention of our mindes in hearing and in praier. To this pur∣pose, in the Scripture, fasting and prayer are for the most part, if not alwaies, ioyned togi∣ther;
because, when the stomacke is full, the body and minde are lesse able, to doe any good dutie; and contrariwise, when absti∣nence is vsed, the heart is lighter, the affecti∣ons in better order, the whole man more quicke and liuely in the seruice of God. For this very cause Anna is saide, to worshippe God night and day with fasting and praier, Luk. 2. 37. And the intent of the Holy Ghost there, is to commend her for the feruencie of her praier, which shee testified in that by such exercises, shee stirred vp and increased the attention of her minde. The third ende is, to testifie the humilitie and contrition of our hearts, that is to say, our inward sorrow and griefe for sinne, and our repentance and effectuall turning vnto God. Without this ende, the fast is but a vaine ceremonie. And therefore the Prophet Ioel calls vpon the people, to turne vnto the Lord with all their hearts, with fasting, wee∣ping, and mourning; to rent their hearts and not their garments, &c. Ioel 2. 12, 13. The Pro∣phet Esay in like manner, reprooveth the Iewes, because when they fasted, they would afflict their soules for a day, and how downe their heads as a burush, and lie downe in sackcloath and ashes: But made no conscience to turne from their euill waies. Esay. 58. 5, 6. There∣fore their outward humiliation was but hy∣pocrisie. The fourth end of a fast, is to admonish
vs of our guiltines before the Lord, and to put vs in mind of the acknowledgement of our sinnes, wherby we become vnworthy of any blessing, gift, or mercie; yea vnworthy to goe vpon the ground, to breath in the aire, to eate, drinke, sleepe, or inioy any other be∣nefit. In a word, that we haue deserued by our sinnes all the plagues and punishments threatued in the Law against sinners. The Malefactor in the day of Assises, cannot giue greater testimonie of the true confession of his guiltines, then by comming before the Iudge, with the rope about his neck; neither can we bring a more notable signe, of our true humiliation before God, then by com∣ming before him, in the day of the solemne fast, with open confession and Proclamation of our guiltinesse, both of sinne and punish∣ment. Hence it was, that in the fast of Nine∣ueh, not onely men but euen the beasts were forbidden to feede or drinke water; for this very end, that the Niuevites might acknow∣ledge their sinnes to be so great, and hei∣nous in the sight of God, that in regard ther∣of, not onely the reasonable creatures them∣selues, but also the beasts of the field, for their sakes, were vnworthy of life and nou∣rishment. III. Question. Whether Popish Fasts be
lawfull, and approoued of God? Ans. They are wicked, and therefore nei∣ther approoued of God, nor to be obserued by man; and that for three speciall causes. First, the patrons & maintainers of them, doe appoint set times of fasting, which are, necessarily to be kept, vpon paine of mortall sinne. And abstinence from flesh (with them) is made a matter of conscience. Now to pre∣scribe set times necessarily to be obserued, is contrarie to that libertie, which the Church of God and the gouernours thereof haue for this purpose, onely vpon speciall occasion. When the question was mooued to our Savi∣our, by Iohns Disciples, Why they and the Pharises fasted often, whereas his fasted not; Answer was giuen in this manner, Can the children of the marriage chamber mourne, as long as the bridegrome is with them? But the daies will come, when the bridegrome shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast, Mat. 9. 15. From whence we may gather, that times of fasting must be, accor∣ding to the times of mourning. For Christ giues them to vnderstand, that they were to fast, as occasions of mourning were offered. As therefore, there can be appointed no set time for mourning, no more can there be enioyned a set time for fasting; but must be
left to the libertie of the Church, to be pre∣scribed, as God shall giue occasion. Againe, the Apostle reprooueth the Church of Ga∣latia, for obseruing set daies, and moneths, & times, and yeares, in way of Religion. Gal. 4. 10. Montanus the Hereticke is thought (in Euseb. Hist. Eccl. l. 5. c. 17. Ecclesiasticall stories) to haue beene the first, that made lawes for set-fasting. And the Churches of God in ancienter times, fasted of their own accords freely, not inforced by law or commandement, but as time and oc∣casion serued. It is alleadged, that this doctrine seemes to chalenge the Church of England of He∣resie: for it appointeth and obserueth set times of fast. Ans. Nothing lesse. For our Church inioyneth and approoueth these times, not vpō necessity, or for religions sake, but for ciuill and politicke respects: whereas the Romish church, holds it a mortal sinne, to put off a set fast appointed, so much as till the next day following. The second reason. They of the Church of Rome make a distinction of meates. For they wholly forbid flesh to be eaten vpon daies of fast, and allow whit-meates onely then to be vsed; and that of necessitie. Now this difference of meates is partly impious, partly absurd and foolish. Impious it is, because they make it for Re∣ligions sake. For since the cōming of Christ, there is a libertie giuen to all men whatsoe∣uer,
to eate of all kindes of meates, without any distinction: commanding abstinence frō nothing, which God hath created, to be re∣ceiued with thanksgiuing. It is true indeede, we hold a difference betweene meate and meate, but how? not in way of religion, but in regard of temperance & health, for ci∣uill and politike vses, and respects. As for the other, we rest vpon the word of God, & hold it with Paul, a doctrine of Deuills, to command forbearance of meates, in regard of consci∣ence, 1. Tim. 4. 3. But to this place of Paul, they giue an∣swer, and say, that it is spoken of Heretikes, such as the Manichees, & Novatiās &c. were, that held meats in their own nature vnclean. We on the other side reply, and say, that this text condemnes those that make meates any way vncleane. And that the Papists doe put this difference, in way of Religion, and con∣science; as appeareth by their strait pro∣hibitions of flesh as vncleane, and that for conscience sake. And this text they shall ne∣uer be able to shift off: for it plainely con∣demneth any such distinction; seeing to the pure, all things are pure; and euery creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, so it be receiued with thanksgiuing, 1. Tim. 4. 4. Furthermore, this difference of meates is also foolish. For first, the light of nature and common sense teacheth, that in such meates, as they permit, there is as much delicacie,
pleasure, and contentment, yea as much (if not more) strength: for example: in some fish, fruits, and wines, as is in flesh by them forbidden. Yea S. Paul ascribes flesh vnto fi∣shes, 1. Cor. 15. 39. There is one flesh of men, an other of beasts, an other of fishes, &c. Secondly, I call it foolish, because in their set Fasts they forbid flesh, but permit diuers wines, and the daintiest iuncates that the Apothecaries shoppe can affoarde: whereas in a solemne fast, all meates, drinks, and all other delights, of what kinde and nature soeuer, are to be forborne. For this was the practise of the Church in former times, to forbeare not one∣ly ordinarie foode, but soft apparell, sweete oyntments, and whatsoeuer it was, that ser∣ued to refresh and cheare the heart, as hath beene shewed. The third Reason. The Church of Rome giueth to their fastings, false and erroneous endes; as namely, to merit something at the hands of God thereby, to satisfie his iustice for sinne, and to be true and proper parts of his worship. And that these are false and er∣ronious, I prooue by these reasons. First, they do wholly frustrate the death of Christ, which is the onely thing in the world appointed by God, to be meritorious and sa∣tisfactorie. Secondly, Fasting of it selfe, is a thing in∣different, neither good nor euill. For though it be referred to a religious end, which is the
humbling of the soule; yet it is not good in it selfe, but onely in regard of the end. Neither is it any part of Gods worshippe, beeing so referred; but only a proppe and furtherance, seruing (in the right vse thereof) to make a man more fit for the duties of Gods seruice. Thirdly, these ends if they be well consi∣dered, cannot be the true ends of fasting, as will appeare by this example. A begger at our doores, entreats an almes, we giue it, and he receiues it. But will any man say, that by begging he doth merit or deserue his almes? In like manner we are all beggers, that haue nothing of our owne, neither food nor rai∣ment, nor any other blessing we doe inioy, but all we haue, commeth vnto vs onely from God. Well, vpon iust occasion we giue our selues to fasting, we pray earnestly vnto him for mercie, in the pardon of our sinnes. In this case, is it not great madnesse to thinke, that we by begging mercie can merit mercie at the hands of God? But praier (saith the Pa∣pist) as it is praier, merits nothing, but as it is a good worke. Ans. Praier as it is a good worke, is no other then begging; and then it is vnpossible, that it should be meritorious, vnlesse it be granted, that begging is merito∣rious, which cannot be. These reasons considered, I conclude, that Popish fasts, which stand in force among them at this day, are wicked and damnable, and consequently to be abolished, if it were
no more, but for the blasphemous ends, which they make of them. And thus much touching this point of Fa∣sting, as also concerning the other Heades of Gods outward worship. CHAP. XVI. Of the Sabboth day. THe fourth maine Question touching man, as he stands in relation to God, is concer∣ning the Time of Gods wor∣ship. Wherein certaine parti∣cular questions are to be re∣solued touching the Sabboth day. The First, and most principall of all the rest is this. Whether it be in the liber∣tie of the Church of God vpon earth, to alter the Sabboth day from the seuenth day, to any other? In answering to this Question I will not resolutely determine, but onely propound that which I thinke is most probable.
First therfore, I answer negatiuely. That it is not in the Churches libertie, to alter the Sabboth, from the Seuenth day. The reasons are these. I. Reason. The substance of the fourth com∣mandement is vnalterable. Now the sanctify∣ing of a rest vpon the seventh day, is the sub∣stance of the fourth cōmandement. Therfore the sanctifying of the rest of the seuenth day, is vnalterable in regard of any creature. That the truth of this reason may appeare two things are to be considered. First, what is changeable and temporarie in the Sab∣both: and then, what is morall and perpetu∣all. Sect. 1. The things which are temporarie and ce∣remoniall What is Ce∣remoniall in the Sabboth. in the Sabboth day, are these. I. That rigorous and precise rest, prescri∣bed to the Iewes, which stoode in the strait obseruation of three things. First, the Iewe might not on the Saboth goe forth, or take a iourney any whether, for any matter or busines of his owne. For of this, there was a speciall commandement gi∣uen, Exod. 16. 29. Tarry euery man in his place: let no man goe out of his place the seuenth day, namely, to doe any worke, or busines of his owne whatsoeuer. Secondly, the Iewe might not kindle a fire vpon the Sabboth day. For so saith the
Lord by Moses, Ye shall kindle no fire through∣out your habitations; &c. Exod. 35. 3. It will be then said, How did they for meate and fire in winter? Ans. They prepared and dressed their meat the day before: as they were com∣manded, Exod. 16. 24. And for fires in win∣ter, if they had any vpon the Sabboth, it was necessarie (as I suppose) that as they drest their meate the day before, so they should then beginne their fire also, which beeing then begunne, might be preserued on the Sabboth. Thirdly, the Iewe might not carrie a bur∣den. This the Lord did expressely forbidde them by the Prophet Ieremie, Thus saith the Lord, Carrie no burdens vpon the Sabboth day, neither bring them in by the gates of Ierusalem, &c. Ier. 17. 21. And Nehemiah charged the men of Iudah, with the prophanation of the Sabboth in that kinde, Neh. 13. 15, 16, 17. In these three particulars, stood the strict ob∣seruation of the Iewish rest; which is alto∣gether temporarie, and doth not concerne the times of the New Testament; because it was onely typicall, the Sabboth beeing (in regard of that manner of rest) a figure of the most strict spirituall rest from all sinne, in thought, word, and deede, required of cuery true beleeuer. II. Againe, in the Sabboth this was cere∣moniall and temporarie, that it was a speci∣all signe betweene God and his people, of
the blessings that were propounded & pro∣mised in the Couenant, Exod. 31. 13. And these were principally two. First, it was a signe of their sanctification, to teach them, that as the Lord had set apart a day of rest, so he did and would sanctifie the obseruers thereof vnto himselfe, by forgiuing their sinnes, and receiuing them into his fauour, in and by the Messias to come. Secondly, it was ordained by God, to figure and signifie the euerlasting rest of Gods children, in the kingdome of heauen. Of this the Prophet E∣say speakes, when he saith, that from moneth to moneth, and from Sabboth to Sabboth, all flesh shall come to worship before God, Esa. 66. 23. And the author to the Hebrewes, There remaineth therefore a Sabbatisme, or rest to the people of God, Heb. 4. 9. III. Furthermore, this was temporarie in the Sabboth, that it was to be obserued vpon a set day, namely, the seauenth from the Creation, and that with set rites and cere∣monies. So saith Moses, The seauenth day is the Sabboth, Deut. 5. 14. Againe, On the Sab∣both day, ye shall offer two lambes of a yeare old, without spot, and two tenth deales of fine flower, for a meate offering mingled with oyle, and the drinke offering thereof: and the burnt offering of euery Sabboth, beside the continuall burnt offe∣ring, and the drinke offering thereof, Numb. 28. 9, 10. IV. This also was Ceremoniall, that it
was to be obserued, in remembrance of their deliuerance out of Egypt Remember that thou wast a seruant in the land of Egypt, and the Lord thy God brought thee out thence, by a mightie hand and stretched out arme: therefore the Lord thy God commanded thee to obserue the Sabboth day, Deut. 5. 15. Sect. 2. Now, as there were some things tempo∣rarie and Ceremoniall in the Sabboth: so there are some things in it perpetuall & Mo∣rall, and those I take it are three especially. First, that there should be a day of rest, in which man and beast might be refreshed af∣ter labour. Secondly, that this day should be sanctifi∣ed; that is, set apart to the worship of God. These two first, are therefore morall, because they are expressely mentioned in the Com∣mandement touching the Sabboth. Thirdly, that a seauenth day should be sanctified to an holy rest, and that this holy rest should be obserued in a seauenth day. I say not, in this or that seauenth day, but in one of the seauen. Now that this also is morall, it appeares by these reasons. First, the Sabboth of the seauenth day, was instituted and appointed by God in Pa∣radise, before the fall of man, and the reuea∣ling of Christ; yea euen then, when there
was one condition of all men. This is plain∣ly set downe in Gen. 2. as also in the fourth Commandement. And vpon this ground it is manifest, that a Sabboth of a seauenth day cannot be a Ceremonie simply, considering the ordination thereof was in time long be∣fore all Ceremonies. If it be obiected, that it was made a Ceremonie afterward. I answer, that the reason is naught. For Matrimonie was ordained in Paradise, and afterward made ceremoniall, to signifie the spirituall vnion betweene Christ and his Church, and yet Matrimonie is perpetuall: and so is a Sabboth of a seauenth day. If it be againe ** alleadged, that God did then keepe a seuenth day in his owne person, and afterward inioy∣ned it to man by his commandement. I an∣swer, that the institution of the Sabboth in Paradise consisted of two parts, Blessing, and Sanctification: and the meaning of the Holy Ghost is, that God did both blesse it in re∣gard of himselfe, because he kept it in his owne person, and hallowed it also in regard of man, by commanding it to be sanctified and kept in performance of holy duties. Secondly, the reasons of the fourth Com∣mandement are generall, and the equitie of them is perpetuall, and they haue this ende, to vrge the rest of a seauenth day. Let them be considered in particular. The first, in these wordes, Sixe daies shalt thou labour. Which some take to be a permission: as if God
should haue said thus; If I permit thee sixe, thou shalt allow me a seauenth. But they may be also taken for a commandement, inioy∣ning labour in the sixe daies; first, because they are propounded in cōmanding termes; secondly, because they are an exposition of the curse laid vpon Adam, Thou shalt eate thy bread in the sweat of thy face, namely, in the sixe daies: and thirdly, because idlenes, the spoile of mankind, is there forbidden. This beeing so, there must needes be a seauenth day, not onely of rest, to ease them that la∣bour in the sixe daies, but also of an holy rest, that God might be worshipped in it. The second reason is taken from Gods ex∣ample: For in sixe daies, the Lord made heauen and earth, &c. That which the Lord himselfe hath done in person; the same must man doe by his commandement. But the Lord him∣selfe in sixe daies laboured, and rested the seauenth. Therefore man must doe the same. This reason made by God to the creature, must stand in force, till he reuerse it, which yet he hath not done, nor doth. If then these reasons doe not onely inforce a rest, and an holy rest but a rest on the seauenth day; then this lest on the seauenth day, is a part of the fourth Commandement: and consequently the Church can not alter it from the Sab∣both day, because they can not alter the sub∣stance of that Commandement which is e∣ternall.
II. Reason. The Sabboth day in the new Testament, (in all likelihood) is tied to that, which we call the Lords day, and that (as I take it) by Christ himselfe. The Reasons thereof are these. I. The sabboth day of the new Testament, is called the Lord daie, Apoc. 1. 10. Now I suppose, (for in these points still wee must goe by likelyhoods) its called the Lords day, as the last Supper of Christ, is called the Lords Supper, for two causes. First, as God rested the seauenth day after the Creation, so Christ hauing ended the worke of the new creation, rested on this day from his worke of redemption. Secondly, as Christ did substitute the last supper in roome of the passeouer, so he substituted the first day of the weeke in roome of the Iewes Sabboth, to be a day set apart to his owne worship. II. The Church of Corinth everie first day of the weeke, made a collection for the poore, as we may read, 1. Cor. 16. 2. and this collection for the poore in the primitiue church followed the Preaching of the word, Praier, and the Sacraments, as a fruite therof, Act. 2. 42. For these be Sabboth exercises, that went alwaies together in the Apostoli∣call Church. But it will be saide, that colle∣cting for the Saints, is a matter of indifferen∣cie, and may be done vpon any day, as well as vpon the Sabboth. To this I answer, that Paul cōmands the Corinths to doe it, as he
had ordained it in the Church of Galatia: whereby he makes it to be an Apostolicall, and therefore a diuine ordinance. Yea, that very text doth in some part manifest thus much, that it is an ordinance and institution of Christ, that the first day of the weeke should be the Lords daie. For Paul com∣maundeth nothing, but what he had from Christ. III. Christ and his Apostles, kept the first day of the weeke as the Sabboth. For Christ rose againe, the first day of the weeke, and appeared to his disciples, Ioh. 20. 19. and eight daies after, he appeared againe to Tho∣mas, ver. 26. which was the next first day of the weeke. And this hath beene the opinion of sundrie ancient diuines. Cyrill. lib. 12. in Iohan. cap. 58. Cyrill vpon Iohn, saies, that this eight day was without doubt the Lordes daie, and so ought to be kept, because it is likely Christ himselfe kept it holy. And the same is affirmed and taught by Ad Casula∣num. Epist 86. ad Ianuarium. Epist 119. c. 13. Augustine and Sermon. 5. de resrect. Chrysostome. Again, the Apostles also kept it. For when the Holy Ghost descended vpon them, they were a∣gaine assembled vpon this day, Act. 2. v. 1. which I prooue thus. The day of Pentecost was the first day of the weeke; for the Iewes were commanded to bring a sheafe of their first fruits, the morrow after the Sabboth in the passeouer, Levit. 23. 10. &c. and betwixt that and Pentecost, they were to reckon fiftie daies. Hence it followeth, that the day of
Christs resurrection, falling the morrow after the Iewes Sabboth, which is the first daie of the weeke; Pentecost must needes fall on that day: and therefore the Apostles met that same day, and not they onely, but also the whole Church gathered themselues toge∣ther, and celebrated this day with preaching of the word, and administration of the Sacra∣ments, Act. 20. 7. And according to this insti∣tution of Christ, and the examples of his A∣postles, hath beene the constant practise of the Church, from their times vntill now. IV. That which was prefigured, in that it was prefigured was prescribed: but the Lords day was prefigured in the eight day, wherein the children of the Iewes were circumcised: therefore it was prescribed to be kept the eight day. Thus the ancient fathers, by name Cyprian and Augustine haue reasoned and taught. Againe, the day of Christs resurrecti∣on was prefigured by that day, wherein the stone which the builders refused, was made the head of the corner, Psalm. 118. v. 24. and in that it was prefigured it was appoin∣ted by God. For then it appeared to be true which Peter saith of Christ, that god had made him both Lord and Christ, Act. 2. 36. And the same may be said of the Sabboth of the new testament, that it was in the figure preordai∣ned, and therefore limited and determined by our Sauiour Christ vnto the Lords day. Other reasons might be added, but they are
onely coniectures: these be the princi∣pall. III. Reason. God is Lord of times and seasons, and therefore in all equitie, the altering and disposing therof is in his hands, and belongs to him alone. Act. 1. 10. Times & seasons the father hath kept in his owne hand. A∣gaine, Christ is called the Lord of the Sab∣both. And Autiochus Epiphanes is condem∣ned by the Holy Ghost, because he tooke vp∣on him to alter times. Dan. 7. 25. Besides that, Daniel saith, that it is God alone that chan∣geth times and seasons, Dan. 2. 21. Now if it be proper vnto God, as to create, so to de∣termine and dispose of times, then he hath not left the same to the power of any crea∣ture. And therfore as the knowledge thereof, so the appointment, and alteration of the same, either in generall or particular, belongs not to the Church, but is reserued to him. The Church then, neither may nor can alter the Sabboth day. And this is the first part of the answer. Sect. 2. The Second is this, If the Church had li∣bertie to alter the Sabboth, then this altera∣tion must be made within the compasse of the weeke, to the sixt, or fift, or fourth, or se∣cond, or third, or first daie, and not to the eight, or ninth, or tenth daies without the compasse of the weeke. The reason is plaine.
The Church of the New Testament, hath more knowledge and more grace, then the people of the old Testament had; and in that regard, ought to haue more zeale, and greater alacritie in the worship of God then they had, that it may exceede the Iewes ac∣cording to the measure of grace receiued. And thus, the first and principall question touching the Sabboth, is answered and re∣solued. Sect. 3. Now, before I come to the next, let vs in Obiections. the meane while see and examine the Rea∣sons, that are brought against the answer pre∣sently made. First therefore it is alleadged, that in the new Testament there is no dif∣ference of daies. For if we haue or make dif∣ference of daies, we are in truth no better then Iewes. That there is no distinction of daies, they prooue out of two places. The first is, Col. 2. 16. where the Apostle saies, Let no man condemne you in respect of an holy day, or of the new moone, or of the Sabboth day. The se∣cond, Gal. 4. 10. where the same Apostle re∣prooues the Galatians, for obseruing daies, and moneths, and times, and yeares. To this I answere, that both the places speake of the Feasts of the Iewes, and of dif∣ference of daies, that stands in force by the Iewish Ceremoniall law. Paul to the Colos∣sians, warnes them to giue no occasi∣sion
to others, whereby they might iustly condemne them, for obseruing of daies in superstitious manner, vpon opinion of holi∣nes and necessitie, as if mens consciences were bound to such obseruation. And he reprooues the Galatians, for obseruing daies (as it is likely they did) not onely in the Iew∣ish, but also in the Heathenish manner. To which purpose Paul saith, v. 11. He is afraid of them. His meaning was, because they pla∣cing their saluation (in part) in their Iewish obseruation of daies, after they had beene informed touching their libertie in Christ, did thereby mixe the Gospel with the Law: and therefore he feared, least by that meanes Christ should become vnto them vnprofita∣ble, and so his preaching to small or no pur∣pose. Againe, they alleadge, Rom. 14. 5. where Paul saith, One man esteemes one day better then an other, and an other man counteth euery day a∣like. In which words the Apostle blameth not them, which thinke all daies as one. Ans. In the New Testament, all daies be as one, in regard of the aptnes thereof to the worship of God: and yet there may be a dif∣ference of daies in regard of order: and this Paul no where condemneth. That we may the better conceiue this distinction, we must consider a difference betweene the Iewes Sabboth and ours, which is this; That the Iewes Sabboth was both the time of the
worship of God, and also a part of his wor∣ship. But the Sabboth of the new Testament, though it be a necessarie time of Gods wor∣ship, yet it is not a part thereof. If it be said, that it is commanded, therfore  must needs be a part of Gods worship: I answer: It is commanded, not as Gods worship for sub∣stance, but in respect of the duties of the worship, that are to be kept and performed in it. And hence it is manifest, that in regard of Gods worship, there is no difference of daies in the new Testament, but in regard of order. Thirdly, they obiect, that Paul kept the Iewes Sabboth, as well as the Lords day. For he and Barnabas came to Antiochia, and went into the Synagogue on the Sabboth day, Act. 13. 14. And againe, he and Timothie conuerted Lydia vpon the same day. Act. 16. 13. Ans. The Apostle did this vpon very good ground, not because he held the obser∣uation of it as necessarie as the other; but in regard of the weaknes of the Gentiles and Iewes newly called. For the Church that consisted of such persons in those daies, was not yet fully perswaded and resolued of the abrogation of the wish Sabboth: and ther∣fore, for the time, he yeelded to their weak∣nes, and obserued it as well as the other. But afterward, when they were confirmed in that point, he forbare that libertie, & taught
the full abolishment both of it, and other Ceremonies. Fourthly, Act. 18. 3, 4. Paul is said to come to Corinth to Aquila and Priscilla, and to worke with them in their trade of tent-ma∣king: and further, it is said, that he disputed in the Synagogue euery Sabboth day, that is, on the Iewes Sabboths, and exherted the Iewes and Grecians: Hence it is gathered by some, that Paul did onely keepe the Sabboth of the Iewes, and that both on the Lords day, and on the weeke daies, he wrought with Aquila and Priscilla. Ans. First, we must remember this Rule, That Charitie and Necessitie, doe dispense with the Sabboth, and with Ceremonies. If a Towne should be on fire, or if a Citie or countrey should be presently assaulted by the enemie, in the time of the word preach∣ed, on the Sabboth day; the preaching of the word, in these cases, must cease for a time, till by conuenient helpe the fire be quenched, and the enemie be taken or dri∣uen backe. Now whereas Paul in the ordi∣narie daies of the weeke made tents, and on the seauenth too, not obseruing it, but the Iewes Sabboth; we must know, that he did it vpon necessitie, for the saluation of the Iewes. For Priscilla and Aquila were Iewes vnconuerted, and Christ was not yet reuea∣led vnto them. And if Paul had but once na∣med Christ, he could haue done no good a∣mong
them. Yet afterward, when he saw better opportunitie, at the comming of Silas and Timotheus from Macedonia, then he could no longer containe himselfe, but bur∣ned in the spirit, and testified to the Iewes, that Ie∣sus was the Christ, vers. 5. Now if there was cause why he did not speake of Christ for the time, then was there cause also why he did not make profession of a Sabboth. Se∣condly I answer, though Paul did not then openly sanctifie the Sabboth; yet it is to be supposed, that he kept it priuately by him∣selfe, reseruing some speciall time for that purpose: and the contrarie cannot be shew∣ed. The Second Question touching the Sab∣both. How the Sabboth of the New Testament is to be ob∣serued? Ans. In obseruing a Sabboth of the new Testament, there are two things required; a Rest, and a Sanctification of the same rest to an holy vse. This Answer is made out of the very substance of the fourth Commande∣ment, which is morall, and hath nothing ce∣remoniall in it. And the fourth Commande∣ment (for substance) consists in a ceasing frō labour, and a holy dedication of our rest to holy vse, that is, to the worship and seruice
of God. Sect. 1. Now touching the first point, the Rest of the Sabboth; there are three seuerall Opini∣ons, Rest. whereof two are contrarie, and the third is a meane betweene both. The first Opinion is, that we are bound as strictly to keepe the outward rest of the Lords day, as the Iewes were to keepe the Sabboth: and sundrie men are of this minde. But I take it, this opinion is not warrantable. For (as we said before) the Iewish manner of keeping the Sabboth in straitnes, is a Cere∣monie. And if we be bound to keepe it as straitly as the Iewes did, then Iudaisme must still remaine, and the ceremoniall Law (at least in some part) must still be in force. But in fauour of this opinion, it is allead∣ged. First, that the fourth Commandement is a Law, giuen as well to Christiās as to Iewes, and therefore it binds both alike. Ans. The fourth Commandement bindeth Christians to keepe a seauenth day for the Sabboth, both in respect of Rest, as also in regard of Sanctification thereof; but that it bindeth them to the same strait manner of keeping the rest, as it did the Iewes, we vtterly de∣nie. Secondly, That the reasons vsed to inforc▪ the Commandement, doe equally binde all: therefore the Commandement it selfe. Ans.
It is true for the dutie commanded, but not for the manner of performance. Againe, the reason alleadged doth not follow: for some∣times the holy Ghost vseth a reason that is perpetuall, to inforce a Ceremonie. That Le∣vi should haue no part, nor inheritance amōg his brethren, was a Ceremonie commanded by God; and yet the Lord inforceth it, with a reason that was perpetuall, namely, because himselfe was the part and inheritance of Le∣vi, among the children of Israel, Numb. 18. 20. Thirdly, that the Sabboth is a signe (to be∣leeuers in the new Testament) that God is their God, and they his people; and the same it was to the Iewes: therefore the bond is as strict to the one, as to the other. Ans. 1. Be∣leeuers vnder the Gospel, haue two onely signes of the Couenant, Baptisme and the Lords Supper, and no more. 2. The Scrip∣ture restraineth the Sabboth, as a signe, onely to the Iewes. It is a signe betweene me and you in your generations, Exod. 31. 13. Againe, v. 16. the children of Israel shall keepe the Sabboth—for an euerlasting couenant. 3. The Sabboth was not a signe in the first institution in Pa∣radise. For the Couenant of grace was made after the fall of man, and the signe thereof must needes be appointed after it: conside∣ring that before the fall, Ceremonies signify∣ing sanctification had no place. And this is the first Opinion.
The second Opinion touching the Rest of the Sabboth, is flat contrarie to the former; namely, that on the Sabboth day, (after the publike worship of God is ended, and the Congregation dissolued,) men haue libertie either to giue themselues to labour, or to ho∣nest pleasures and recreations. This Opinion doth quite abolish one of the Commande∣ments of the Decalogue. For it presupposeth all daies to be alike, this onely prouided, that the publike worship of God be solemn∣ly kept. Now this may be done in any day of the weeke; and there will be no neede of appointing a set time for Gods seruice, if all daies be equall, without any difference or distinctiō. But the fourth Cōmandement (for substance) is eternall, and requireth (vpon paine of the curse) both rest from labour, and a setting apart of the same rest, to the duties of holines & religion. And if it com∣mand abstinence from ordinarie abour, then much more from pleasures and recreati∣ons. The third and last Opinion, holdes the meane betweene the two former extremi∣ties, and that I take to be the best and safest. The substance hereof consists of these two conclusions. 1. That vpon the Sabboth day of the new Testament, men are to rest from the or∣dinarie labours of their callings. Thus much is commanded in the fourth commandemēt.
For the rest it selfe was not a ceremonie, (as I said before) but the straight & precise man∣ner of resting. Againe, it is most necessarie, that religion and the power thereof, should be maintained amongst Gods people, which cannot possibly be, vnlesse men (at some∣times) set themselues apart vnto it. The stu∣dent that desires learning, doth not attaine vnto knowledge, vnlesse he doe daily conse∣crate and devote himselfe to the studie ther∣of. In like maner, religion cannot be preser∣ved and maintained in the Church, except men doe whollie and continually employ themselues in the practise of the same. Fur∣thermore, it is the libertie that Gods lawe giues to seruants, yea and to beasts, that they shall not be oppressed with labour by wor∣king on the Lords day; & this liberty is groū∣ded vpon the law of nature, & cōmon equity. Here the common sort are wont to reply and say. If we must rest from the labour of our callings the whole day, we shall not be able to maintaine our selues and our fami∣lies. To which it may be answered, that they which gathered Manna onely in the sixe daies, had as much as they, that gathered it on the seuenth day; & that which they gathe∣red the seuenth day, did not remaine sweete, but stanke and perished. They therefore which rest on the Sabboth daie, must not be distracted with needelesse cares, but liue by by faith, and depend vpon Gods providence
for meate, drinke, and clothing. And the la∣bour of the calling then vsed, when it is ex∣pressely forbidden by God, bringeth ra∣ther a curse with it, then a blessing. Againe, such persons must remember, that Godlinesse hath the promises of this life, and the life to come. 1. Tim. 4. 8. and if they will first seeke the king∣dome of God and his righteousnesse, all things ne∣cessarie shall be cast vnto them in way of aduan∣tage, Mat. 6. 33. Therefore, if they keepe his commandement, and rest vpon the seuenth day, God will in mercy giue a blessing, and they shall no lesse receiue from him their dai∣ly bread, in that day, then in any other. II. Conclusion. In this Rest, sundry kindes of workes may be done, and that with good conscience; principally two. The first are workes both holy, and of pre∣sent necessitie. And they are such, as cannot be done before or after the Sabboth. These are likewise of two sorts. The first are those, that doe necessarily pertaine to Gods worshippe, so as without them God cannot be wor∣shipped. Of this kind is the Sabboth daies iourney, Act. 1. 12. allowed among the Iewes to the people, to goe and heare the word preached. Thus we read, that the Shunamite went ordinarily vpon the Sabboth and new Moone, to the Prophet, to heare him. For when shee demanded leaue of her husband, to goe to the Prophet, he askes her, Why wilt thou goe, seeing it is neither newe
Moone, nor Sabboth day, 2. King. 4. 23. Of the same sort, were the killing and dressing of sacrificed beastes, in the time of the law; wherof our Sauiour saith, Haue ye not read in the law, how that on the Sabboth daies, the Priests in the temple break the Sabboth, and are blame∣lesse, Mat. 12. 5. The next sort of workes of present necessitie, are those that belong im∣mediately, to the preseruation of the tempo∣rall life of man and beast, or that serue to the good estate of them both. Such are workes of mercie: as, the watering of cattell, Mark. 12. 11. the drawing of a beast out of a pitte, Luc. 14. 5. and such like. The second kind of workes, that may be done vpon the Sabboth, are workes of Chri∣stian libertie, out of the Case of necessitie. These were such as the Iewes might not doe, and yet we in the new Testament may doe them. For example: prouision and dressing of meate, making fires, and carrying of bur∣dens. Yet vpon this libertie, men ought not to gather, that they may doe what they will, because they must cease from the ordinarie execution of the works of their callings. For the word of God giueth no such warrant: men are in this case, to submit themselues to his will expressely reuealed, and to vse their libertie according to the same. Here two Cases are propounded. I. Case. Whether we may not lawfully vse recreations on the Sabboth day, as shoo∣ting,
bowling, hunting, hawking, wrastling, &c? Ans. I take it, we are not denied to reioice and solace our selues vpon this day. For to some men, at some times, recreation may be more necessarie then meat, in case of weake∣nes, for present preseruation of health. And though not in that regard, yet beeing well sed, it may be a furtherance to men, in the performance of the duties of godlines, as well as in the duties of their calling. But this reioycing must be such as was the reioycing of the Iewes, Nehem. 8. 12. which was onely spirituall, and in the Lord. For they reioyced onely for this, that they vnderstood the law of God, that was taught them. But as for the recreations and pastimes a∣forenamed, as bowling and such like, they are not at this time to be vsed. My reason is this. That which is the more principall and necessarie, namely labour in the execution of a mans calling, is forbidden: recreation there∣fore which is for labour, must cease on that day when labour ceaseth. Againe if the du∣ties of the ordinary vocation, otherwise law∣full and commendable, be therefore forbid∣den, because they destroy the rest comman∣ded, and take vp the mind, that it cannot be freely emploied in the affaires of God, then much more are workes of pleasures forbid∣den, because they doe the same things much more, though otherwise in themselues they
be not vnlawfull. Obiect. Seruants must haue recreation, otherwise how shall they be able to worke in the weeke day? Ans. True; but their recreation must be granted them in the daies of labour. For recreation pertaineth not to rest, but to labour, and is therefore v∣sed, that a man by it may be made more fitte to labour. II. Case. Whether men vpon any occasion, may not doe a worke of their callings, in the morning or euening of the Sabboth day, as Tradesemen, for example I answer that they may, so be it they obserue foure caveats. I. That the worke done, be no scandall to any person. II. That it withdraw not the mind of the worker or any other, from sanctifying the Sabboth, either publickely or priuately. III. That it be not a worke of gaine, but a worke of mercie, or tend to a worke of mer∣cie. IV. That it serue for the immediate pre∣seruation of life, health, or goods. Of life; thus Elias continued his flight from Iezabel many Sabboths together. 1. King. 19. 8. And the reason is good: the Sabboth was made for man (saith Christ) that is, not for the hurt, but for the good of man. Of health; and thus our Sauiour Christ visited the sicke. Ioh. 5. 3. and cured the blind man vpon the Sabboth. Ioh. 9. 14. By whose example, the Phisitian & the Chirurgion may lawfully goe, not onely to giue necessarie counsell, but to minister necessarie phisicke and doe cures. Lastly, of
goods which are in present danger of loo∣sing. Thus Christ would haue the oxe pre∣sently pulled out of the pit, Luk. 14. 5. and the shippe on the shore full fraught with wares, requires present helpe, if it be in apparent danger of sinking. Thus much concerning the first thing, required in the observation of the Sabboth. Sect. 2. The second thing, required in the halow∣ing of the Sabboth of the new testament, is Sanctification of Rest. the Sanctification of rest, which is nothing els, but the dedicating of it to a religious vse, that is, to the practise of diuine worshippe. This sanctification, is either publicke or pri∣uate. The publike, is the solemne performance of spirituall workes, commanded in the se∣cond and third Commandements, and ten∣ding to publike worship. And this may be reduced to foure principall heads. I. The reading or preaching of the word, when the Minister publikely in the Congregation as∣sembled, doth faithfully deliuer vnto the people pure and sound doctrine, and applies the same as necessitie requireth, and occasion serueth, to the edification and saluation of all and euery hearer in publicke audience: and the people on the otherside, do reuerent∣ly and attentiuely heare the same word read and preached. II. The administration of the
Sacraments according to Gods institutiō, by the Ministers of the Church lawfully called. III. Publike praier, wherein the Minister cal∣leth vpon the name of the Lord, & the whole congregation, in feruent affection, lift vp their hearts vnto him, and in mind giue assent to the praiers made in the name and behalfe of them. IV. Collection and giuing of almes for the reliefe of the poore, whether they be captiues and strangers, or those that dwell a∣mong vs, the sicke, the needie, orphanes and widowes, and such like. Vpon these foure heads, doth stand the whole publike worship of God. For proofe and declaration hereof, read these places, Neh. 8. Act. 2. 42. Act. 13. 14. 15. Act. 16. 13. Act. 20. 7. 1. Cor. 16. 1. 2. &c. Priuate sanctification, (which serueth to answer the second opinion) stands in these things. I. That euery man in the beginning of the Sabboth, in the morning, do priuatly pre∣pare himselfe to the publicke seruice that followeth, by priuate prayer, by examinati∣on and humbling of himselfe before God, in respect of his particular sinnes. This the wise∣man exhorteth vnto, when he saith, Take heede to thy foote when thou entrest into the house of God, Eccles. 4. 17. and his meaning is, that before a man betakes himselfe to the pub∣licke congregation, there to perform seruice and worship vnto God, he should looke into his heart, and examine his affections and
thoughts, that he come not vnprepared, which duty though it be alwaies to be done, yet principally on the Sabbothday. The chil∣drē of Israel rose vp early in the morning on the Sabbothday, to offer vp burnt offrings, & peace offerings to an Idol, Exo. 32. 5. 6. much more ought wee, &c. And it is said of our Sauiour Christ, that he arose very early in the morning before day, and went into a solitary place to pray; and the day following was the Sabboth, when he preached in the Syna∣gogues, Mar. 1. 35, 36. II. That when the con∣gregation is dissolued, we spend the rest of the Sabboth; in meditation and conference of the word before preached, and of the creatures. Thus it is said of some that heard Paul preach, that they receiued the word with all readines, and searched the Scripture, whe∣ther those things were so, Act. 17. 11. And the whole 92. Psalme was penned, that it might be a song of the Sabboth, and it containes nothing but a meditation of the workes of God. III. That men priuately exercise them∣selues, in the workes of charitie and mercie; as in visiting the sicke, in making peace be∣tweene those that are at discord, in releeuing the poore, in teaching and instructing the ignorant, in cōforting those that are distres∣sed and comfortlesse. Neh. 8. 12. Then all the people went to eate and to drinke, and to send par abroad to the poore, and to make great ioy. The Tthird Question touching the Sab∣both.
When the Sabboth doth beginne? To this some doe answer, in the euening, and some in the morning. My answer is this, that the Sabboth of the new Testament a∣mongst vs, is to beginne in the morning, and so to continue tl the next morrow, & not in the euening, till the euening. The reasons be these. 1. The Sabboth is to beginne, when other ordinarie daies begin, according to the order and account of the Church wherein wee liue. 2. It was the pra∣ctise of Christ and the Apostles. For Christ (as it hath beene thought of auncient times) consecrated the Sabboth, in that he rose from the dead early in the morning, when the first day of the weeke beganne to dawne, Matth. 28. 1. and therfore it is fitte that the Sabboth day should then beginne when he rose, for as much as it is kept in remembrance of his resurrection. The same was the pra∣ctise of the Apostles. For Act. 20. 7. the first day of the weeke the Iewes came togither at Troas in the morning, & there Paul preach∣ed from that time till midnight, beeing the next morning to depart, hauing staid there as is plaine out of the 6. v. seuen daies. In that text I noe two things. First, that the night there mentioned was a part of the seuenth
day of Pauls abode at Troas. For if it were not so, then he had staied at least a night lon∣ger, and so more then seuen daies, because he should haue staied part of another day. Se∣condly, that this night was a part of the Sab∣both which they then kept. For the Apostle keepes it in manner of a Sabboth, in the ex∣ercises of pietie and diuine worshippe, and namely in Preaching. Yea further he conti∣nues there till the rest was fully ended: He communed with them till the dawning of the day, and so departed. vers. 11. Besides this text, Dauid saith in his Psalme of the Sabboth, that he will declare Gods louing kindnes in the morning, and his truth in the night, Psal. 92. 2. making the night following a part of the Sabboth. Against this doctrine it is alleadged, first, that the Sabboth is to begin in the euening, because in the first of Gen. it is saide, fixe se∣uerall times, the euening and the morning made the first day, and so the second, and third, &c. Ans. First; in that text when it is said, the euening and the morning, made such & such daies, by the euening is vnderstood the night and by the morning the day, and the euening was the end of the day, and the morning the end of the night. This exposition is auncient, and yet in Scripture we find not one place where the euening is put for the night, Se∣condly, I answer that the collection from
that place is of no force. For thus the reason must needs be framed. That which God did in appointing of daies, the same must we doe in vsing of them. But God in appointing of daies, began the day at the euening. Ergo, &c. The consequent is false. For the case is other∣wise in the constitution of time, then it is in the vse of time constituted: and there is not the same reason of things in doing, as there is of the same things in beeing and vse. Thirdly, this did not bind the Iewes. For they in all likelyhood began their Sabboths in the morning. Indeede their solemne feasts, as the Passeover and such like, beganne and were kept from euening to morning, as we may read Levit. 23. 5. But their ordinarie Sab∣both was kept from morning to morning. Whence it is that Saint Matthew calls the dawning of the first day of the weeke, the ende of the Sabboth of the Iewes, Matth. 28. 1. and there is nothing (I take it) that can be brought to the contrarie. It is obiected that Moses saith, Leuit. 23. 32. From euen to euen shall ye celebrate your Sab∣both. Ans. The words must be vnderstood of the feast of reconciliation, beeing the tenth day of the seuenth moneth, which was so∣lemnized and kept from euen to euen. And it is called a Sabboth, because it was by spe∣ciall commandement appointed to be kept as the Sabboth day and that in two respects. First because it was to be kept holy by the
Iewes, in humbling themselues and offering Sacrifices, vers. 27. Secondly, because vpon that day it was not lawful to doe any seruile worke vpon paine of death, vers. 25. 30. Againe, it is alleadged that Ioseph of Ari∣mathea could not embaulme Christ, by rea∣son that the Sabboth was at hand, and this was the euening. I answer, that the Iewes Sab∣both there ment, concurred with the day of their passeouer, and hence it was that their Sabboth beganne in the euening. By this that hath beene said, the answer to the third Question is plaine, to wit, that in the new Testament the Sabboth is to begin at the morning, and so to continue to the next morning, and not as some suppose to begin at the euen, and continue till the next euen. And thus much touching the speciall Questi∣ons of Gods worshippe, as also generally concerning those that belong to Man as he stands in relation to God. The ende of the second Booke.
THE THIRD BOOKE of the Cases of Conscience, concerning Man, as he stands in relation to man. CHAP. I. Of the Nature and Differences of Vertue, and the Order of the Que∣stions. THVS farre we are pro∣ceeded in the handling of two sorts of Questions, whereof some doe con∣cerne man as he is consi∣dered apart by himselfe, without respect vnto an∣other: some againe concerne man, as he stands in the first relation, namely to God. Now we come by order, to speake of the third and last head of Cases, propounded by the Conscience of man, as he stands in the se∣cond relation, to man. And vnder this Head are comprehended all those Questions of Conscience, that are incident to the liues of men; and which doe belong vnto man, as
he is a member of some Societie, whether it be the Familie, the Church, or the Common∣wealth. For the better and more orderly procee∣ding in this Discourse, some conuenient Subiect or Matter is to be propounded, whereunto all the Questions that followe may fitly be reduced. Now of all other, the most conuenient Subiect in this kind is Ver∣tue, and therefore according the differences of Vertue, we will distinguish the Questions into three seuerall sorts. But before we proceede to particulars, it shall not be amisse to speake somewhat ge∣nerally of Vertue, so farre forth, as the knowledge thereof may giue light to the things that follow. Touching Vertue, two things are briefly to be remembred: first, what it is; and then, what be the distinct kindes thereof. Vertue is a gift of the Spirit of God, and a part of regeneration, whereby a man is made apt to liue well. I call it first, a gift of the Spirit of God, be∣cause in whomesoeuer it is, whether in Chri∣stians or in Heathen men, it hath the nature of a gift that floweth immediately from the spirit of God. And this I put in the first place, to confute the receiued errour of the wisest Heathen Philosophers, which call Vertue an habite of the minde, obtained and confirmed by custome, vse, and practise.
Secondly, I call it such a gift, as is also a part of regeneration; and this is added for two causes. First, that we may put a differēce between Christian and Heathen vertues. For, howbeit the same vertues in kind and name, are and may be found, both in them that professe Christ, and those also that are ignorant of the true God; yet they are in them after a di∣uers manner. For in Heathen men they are the gifts of God, but not parts of regenera∣tion and new birth: but in those that be true Christians, they are indeede not onely the gifts of Gods spirit, but also essentiall parts of regeneration. That we may the better yet conceiue this difference, we must vnderstand, that the grace of God in man, is two-fold; restraining, and renewing. Restraining is that, which bridleth and re∣straineth the corruption of mens hearts, from breaking forth into outward actions, for the common good, that Societies may be pre∣serued, and one man may liue orderly with another. Renewing grace is that, which doth not onely restraine the corruption, but also mortifieth sinne, and renewes the heart daily more & more. The former of these is incidēt to Heathen men; & the Vertues which they haue, serue onely to represse the act of sinne in their outward actions: but in Christians, they are graces of God, not onely bridling
and restraining the affections, but renewing the heart, and mortifyin▪ all corruption. And though those vertues of the Heathen be graces of God, yet they are but generall and common to all: whereas the vertues of Chri∣stians, are speciall graces of the spirit, sancti∣fying and renewing the minde, will, and af∣fections. For example, chastitie in Ioseph was a grace of Gods spirit, renewing his heart; but chastitie in Xeuoerates was a com∣mon grace, seruing onely to curbe and re∣straine the corruption of his heart. And the like may be saide of the iustice of Abraham; a Christian, and of Aristides, a Heathen. Secondly, I adde this clause, to meete with an errour of some learned Philosophers, who taught, that the very nature of Vertue stands in a meane, or mediocritie of affecti∣ons. This that they say is true in part, but not wholly. For the mediocritie, of which they speake, without renouation of affecti∣ons, is nothing: and therefore all vertues, that are not ioyned with a renouation and change of the affections, are no better then sinnes. This point the Philosophers neuer knew, and hence it was, that they stood one∣ly vpon a mediocritie, defining a man to be truly vertuous, that did wisely obserue a meane betweene two extreames. Lastly, I say that this gift of God, makes a man fit to liue well. In which clause standeth the proper effect of Vertue; which is, to make
those in whome it is, to lead their liues well. And by this we are aduertised, to take heede of the opinion of Philosophers, concerning some particular vertues. For in their morall discourses, they giue both the name and the nature of Vertue to those things, which are either false & counterfeit vertues, or indeede none at all. For example, Aristotle makes Vr∣banitie a vertue, which is indeede a sinne, bee∣ing nothing els, but a dexteritie in mocking and descanting vpon reens persons and names: & so it is reckoned by Paul amongst grieuous sinnes and vices, which are to be a∣uoided, Eph. 5. 4. Againe, the Philosopher calls Magnaimitie (whereby a man thinkes himselfe worthie of great honours, & there∣upon enterpriseth great things) a Vertue; which notwithstanding is to be holden a flat vice. For by the law of God, euery man is to range himselfe within the limits of his cal∣ling, and not to dare, once to goe out of it. Whereas on the contrarie, the scope and end of this vertue (as they tearme it) is to make men to attempt high and great matters a∣boue their reach, and so to goe beyond their callings. Besides, it is directly opposite to the vertue of humilitie, which teacheth that a man ought alwaies to be base, vile, & lowly in his owne eyes. The Prophet Dauid cleares himselfe of this sinne, Psal. 131. 1. when he saith, Lord, I am not high minded, mine eyes are not hautie, I haue not walked in things that be
great, and aboue my reach. Furthermore, no Vertue must make vs to forsake good life, but euery one serueth for this ende, to make vs fit to liue a godly life. The next point to be considered is, What be the kindes of vertue. Vertue is either in the minde of man, or in the will. The vertue of the minde, is Pru∣dence. The vertue of the will, is that that or∣ders mans will; and it is two-fold: for it re∣specteth either our selues, or others. That which respecteth our selues, is con∣uersant about two maine things in the heart of man, the reuenging, and the lusting pow∣er. That which respecteth the reuenging power, is Clemencie; which standeth in the ordering and reforming of the raging pow∣er of Anger. The next, which respecteth the lusting power, is Temperance. Vertues that doe respect others, are either concerning curtesie, as Liberalitie; or concer∣ning Equitie. And these consist partly in do∣ing of equitie, as Iustice; partly in defending and maintaining it, as Fortitude. Now according to this distinction of ver∣tues, the Questions of Conscience are to be distinguished, in this sort. Some of them con∣cerne Prudence; some concerne Clemencie; some Temperance; some Liberalitie; some also concerne Iustice, and some Fortitude. Of all which in order.
CHAP. II. Of Questions concerning Prudence. THere are two maine Questi∣ons of Conscience, which cō∣cerne Prudence. I. Question. How a man should practise Prudence or Wise∣dome? This I acknowledge, is a high point in the life of man, and such, as cannot be resolued, as it ought, without great deliberation; not∣withstanding I will doe mine indeauour to answer something. Concerning Prudence, there are sundrie things to be considered. First, what is the beginning of the practise of this vertue: and that in a word, is the Feare of God. This feare standeth principally in two things; the first is, a reuerent awe of the Maiestie of God in all places, & at all times, whereby we are resolued, that wheresoeuer we are, we are in his presence, and what∣soeuer we thinke, speake, or doe, it is whol∣ly and perfectly knowne vnto him. The se∣cond
is, a resolued care to walk as in the pre∣sence of God: that is, to keepe his comman∣dements, and to yeeld obedience vnto his Maiestie in all things. Now that this feare is the beginning of wisedome, it appeares by sundry places of scripture. Psal. 111. 10. The beginning of wisedome, is the feare of Iehouah. Pro. 3. 7. The beginning of knowledge is the feare of the Lord: fooles despise wisedome and vnder∣standing. Moses telleth the children of Israel that herein stood their wisedome and vnder∣standing before the eies of all people, that they obserue and practise all the ordinances and iudgements of God, which he had com∣manded them, Deut. 4. 6. And Dauid profes∣seth of himselfe, that by his daily meditati∣on in the law of God, and keeping his com∣mandements, he became wiser then his enemies, Psal. 119. 98. Yea of more vndestanding then all g teachers, ver. 99. yea further, more prudent then the ancient, ver. 100. Secondly, we must consider the rule of prudence; and that is, spiritual vnderstanding, whereby we are inabled to know and con∣ceiue spiritually truth and falshood, good & badde. This Saint Paul wished vnto the Church of Coloss. when he saith, we cease not to pray for you, and desire, that ye might be fulfil∣led with knowledge of his wil, in al wisedome & spi∣rituall vnderstanding, Col. 1. 9. And the same Apostle exhorting the Romanes, to giue vp their bodies a liuing sacrifice, holy & accep∣table
vnto God, and not to fashion them∣selues like vnto this world; he makes the ground of his exhortation, and consequent∣ly the rule of their obedience thereunto, the renouation of their mindes or vnderstandings, to this ende, That they might prooue, what is the good will of God, acceptable and perfect, and an∣swerably doe and performe the same, Rom. 12. 2. And his reason is good, because though prudence be the rule of all vertues, as the auncient Philosophers among the heathen haue affirmed, yet it selfe must be ruled by a higher rule; which they knew not, namely, by spirituall vnderstanding and knowledge, according to the word of God. Thirdly, we are to consider what is the Practise of Prudence; and wherein it consi∣steth. In the practise thereof, two actions are re∣quired; the one, is Delilration, whereby ac∣cording to spirituall vnderstanding, we ad∣uise what is good and bad, what truth and falshood, what is to be imbraced and done, and what not. The other is Determination, whereby we resolue vpon former delibera∣tion, to imbrace, to doe, to follow, and pur∣sue the best things in euery kind. And there∣in stands the very nature and forme of true Christian prudence, when a man (vpon due consideration of things and actions, toge∣ther with their properties and circumstan∣ces) proceedes to a holy and godly resoluti∣on
according to the rule aforesaid. Now the practize of Prudence in these two actions is very large, and consisteth of sundry bran∣ches. I will onely touch the principall, and propound them in these Rules following. The first Rule is this. A man must, in the first place, and aboue all things in the world, carefully prouide for the forgiuenesse of his sinnes, and the saluation of his soule. This our Sauiour Christ commandeth as a spe∣ciall dutie, Matth. 6. vers. 33. Seeke ye first the the kingdome of God and his righteousnes. And sinners and vnrepentant persons, are sundrie times in scripture termed fooles, as in many other respects, so principally in this, because they faile in this first point of wisedome, go∣ing on in their sinne without repentance. The fiue virgins in the Gospell are for this very cause pronounced foolish, or fooles, because they provided not for the oile of Faith, but did onely content themselues with shining lampes, that is, a naked profession of religion and vertue; and for want of wisedome and prudence in this point, they were iustly de∣priued of accesse into the bedde-chamber. Thus, the rich man, that had great reue∣newes and abundance of wordly wealth, is notwithstanding termed by God himselfe a foole, because he gathered riches to himselfe and was not rich in God; that is, he minded earthly things, and placed his cheife felicitie in vaine and transitorie riches, not once fore∣casting,
how to come into the fauour of God, that he might be saued. To this Rule I adde that, which Paul by way of caueat commendeth to the Ephesi∣ans, Eph. 5. 16. Take heede that ye walke circum∣spectly, not as vnwise, but as wise, redeeming the time. As if he should say, Play the part of wise men; take time while time serues, lay hold of the meanes of saluation, vse no de∣laies in heauenly matters, deferre not your repentance from day to day: for the daies are euill, and you may be surprized in your sinnes before you be aware. II. Rule. We must vse continuall watchful∣nes against our enemies, but specially against our spirituall enemies. This watchfulnes our Saui∣our commandeth often in the Gospel, but specially in Mark. 13. 33. Take heede, watch, and pray. 35. Watch therefore, for ye know not, &c. 37, Those things that I say vnto you, I say vnto all men, Watch. And S. Peter exhorteth in like manner, Be sober, and watch: for your ad∣uersarie the Deuill as a roaring lyon, walketh a∣bout, seeking whome he may deuoure. 1. Pet. 5. v. 8. Now this dutie stands principally in two things. First, that we diligently obserue the danger, wherein we are, by reason of temp∣tations. Secondly, that we daily labour to search and finde out the secret counsells, pra∣ctises, and enterprises of our enemies, and withall seeke to preuent them. To this pur∣pose,
we must watch against the corruptions of our hearts, the temptations of the Deuill, and the day and houre of our death, that we be not found vnprepared. For our owne sinnes are many; Satan is strong and subtill in his suggestions, and temptations; & death, though of all other things it be most cer∣taine, and cannot be auoided, yet it is most vncertaine in regard of the time when, the place where, and the manner and kind, of what and how a man shall ende his daies. III. Rule. Euery man must measure him∣selfe by his owne strength, and doe nothing beyond his abilitie. This Rule is set downe, though expressed in other tearmes, Rom. 12. 3. No man must presume to vnderstand, aboue that which is meete to vnderstand, but ought to be wise according to sobrietie, as God hath dealt to euery man the measure of faith. An example of the transgression of this Rule, we haue in Da∣uids three Worthies, who brake into the host of the Philistims, to fetch Dauid the king water from the well of Bethlem, 2. Sam. 23. 6. Which act of theirs, was a rash enterprise, and such a one, as Dauid himselfe condem∣neth in that Chapter, because they went be∣yond their strength, to encounter with a whole garrison of men, they beeing them∣selues but fewe, namely three in number. IV. Rule. We must distinguish betweene the necessarie workes of our callings, that pertaine to vs, and other workes that are out of our callings,
and pertaine not vnto vs: and we must doe the other, though we leaue these vndone. This Rule is propounded in 1. The. 4. 11. Medle with your owne businesse, that is, do the necessarie workes of your callings that belong to you, though you leaue the other for the time vndone. The contrary to it, is to liue or to behaue himselfe inordinately, 2. Thess. 3. 7. And we haue an example of the transgression hereof in Peter, Ioh. 21. 21. whome when Christ had com∣manded to follow him, he would needes aske him what Iohn should doe; Christs giues him this answer, what is that to thee? In which wordes, he teacheth that not onely Peter, but also euery man must attend vpon the neces∣sarie and proper workes of his owne vocati∣on, and not deale with other mens businesse; which because Peter did, he is by that an∣swer secretly repooued, and iustly condem∣ned of curiositie in that behalfe. V. Rule. We must put a difference betweene things honest and of good report, and things vn∣honest and of bad report, and these we are to let passe, and onely to doe the other. Phil. 4. 8. Whatso∣euer things are true, whatsoeuer things are honest, whatsoeuer things are iust, whatsoeuer things are pure, whatsoeuer things pertaine to loue, whatsoe∣uer things are of good report, if ther be any vertue, if there be any praise, thinke on these things. To E duobus ma∣lis non mini∣mum, sed nn∣trum eligen∣dum. this may be added one caveat, that, Of two e∣uils which are both sins, we must not onely not chuse the les, but we are to chuse neither.
For their damnation is iust, who affirme that men may doe euill, that good may come of it as the Apostle saith, Rom. 3. 8. VI. Rule. Things of profit and pleasure, must giue place to things that belong to vertue and ho∣nestie. This conclusion the light of nature teacheth. Worldly men say, who will shew vs any good? But Dauids praier is, Lord lift thou vp the light of thy countenance vpon vs, Psal. 4. 6. Godlines is the great gaine: therefore all gaine must giue place to godlines, 1. Tim. 6. 6. VII. Rule. We may not trust men vpon faire pretences, that they make vnto vs, without further triall. This point was practised by our Sauiour Christ, who, though many beleeued in his name, when they saw the miracles which he had done; yet he did not commit himselfe vnto them, because he knew them all, Ioh. 2. 24. And it is also verified by the common proverbe, First trie, and then trust. VIII. Rule. We must giue place to the sway of the times, wherein we liue, so farre forth as may stand with keeping faith, and a good con∣science. We may not be temporizers, and change our Religion with the times: but yet we may and must giue place to times, as we giue place to the streame, so that it be done with keeping of true religion, and good con∣science. This Rule was practised by Paul, Act. 28. 11. who liuing among the Heathen, was constramed to speake as they, and there∣fore
he saies, that he departed in a shippe to Rome, whose badge was Castor and Pollux, Act. 19. 10. Againe, he was three yeares in Ephesus an idolatrous place, where the great goddesse Diana was worshipped; yet in all that time he contained himselfe, and spake nothing in particular against Diana, but one∣ly in generall against false gods, saying, that they be no gods that are made with hands, v. 26. Nay. Alexander could not charge him with this, that he had in all that while, bla∣sphemed their goddesse Diana. Paul there∣fore was faine to yeeld to the sway of those times, that so he might doe some good in E∣phesus by his Ministerie. Whereas, if he had spoken against Diana directly, it had not bin possible for him, to haue done that good by preaching, which otherwise he did. Againe, in the Primitiue Church, the Apostles for the weaknes of the Iewes, did yeelde to the vse of Circumcision, and permitted abstinence from blood, and that which was strangled, &c. so farre forth, as it stood with pure reli∣gion, and good conscience: and if they had not so done, they should not haue wonne the Iewes to the faith as they did. IX. Rule. If we cannot doe the good things that we desire, in that exquisite manner that we would, we must content our selues with the meane; and in things which are good, and to be done, it is the safest course to satisfie our selues in doing the lesse, least in ventring to doe the more,
which cannot be, we grow to the extremitie, and so faile or offend in our action. It is a good and wise counsell of the Preacher, to this pur∣pose. Eccl. 7. 16. Be not iust ouermuch: and his meaning may be this; Be not too strict or curious, in effecting that which thou inten∣dest, exactly, when thou canst not; but rest contented in this, that thou hast done thine endeauour; and take to the lesse, when the greater cannot be effected. In some coun∣tries, Popish Images erected in Churches, doe stand vndefaced. The good desire of the people is, that they may be pulled downe; but this cannot be brought to passe. What then are they to doe in this case? they must not grow to extremitie, and pull them down themselues; but they must intreat the lawfull Magistrate for their remooueall, and pray to God, that he may be mooued so to doe; and in the meane time, rest content with that they haue done, and waite the Magistrates plea∣sure. In the Iudiciall law, by reason of the hardnes of the Iewes hearts, sundrie sinnes could not vtterly be taken away, as diuorce∣ments, polygamie, vsurie. Hereupon, the Lord makes a law of Toleration, without approbation; and did not remooue them quite away, for that was not possible, in re∣gard of man, for the time: but restrained the euill, that could not be quite off and aboli∣shed otherwise. And herein appeared the great wisdome of God, in making a Law not
to allow of, nor yet vtterly to take away, but to moderate the practise of these sinnes in the Iewes, for the hardnes of their hearts. In like manner, in this our land there is the pra∣ctise of Vsurie, a sinne that cannot, nor euer shall be rooted out vtterly. For this cause, the States of this kingdome, haue out of their wisdome, prouided a Law for the toleration thereof after a sort, and that vpon speciall cause. For if the Magistrate should haue en∣acted a Law vtterly to abolish it, it would before this (in likelihood) haue growne to great extremitie. The same was the practise of the Apostles in their times, who yeelded to beare with the vse of Circumcision for a time, when they could not otherwise vtterly cut it off. II. Question. Whether a man may law∣fully and with good conscience, vse Pollicie in the affaires of this life? Ans. There be foure principall Caueats, which beeing obserued, Policie may be v∣sed, and is not against Christian religion. I. Nothing must (in policie) be said, done, or in∣tended, to preiudice the truth, specially the truth of the Gospell. II. Nothing is to be said done, or intended, against the honour and
glorie of God, either in word, in deede, or in shew. III. Nothing must be wrought or con∣triued against iustice that is due to man. IV. All actions of policie, must be such as pertain to our calling, and be within the limits and bonds thereof. For if any action whatsoe∣uer, be done out of that calling wherein God hath placed vs, or at least be not answerable thereunto, though it be plotted and at∣tempted in neuer so great wisedome and policie, it is vnlawfull and not warranta∣ble. These Caueats obserued, it is not vnlawful to vse that which we commonly call Policie. And the reason is this: when any busines is to be done, we must make a twofold inquirie. First, into the thing to be done, whether it be good or badde, lawfull or not lawfull, com∣manded or forbidden. Secondly, into our selues, whether the worke in hand be agrea∣ble to the calling of the doer, or answerable to that dutie, which he oweth to God and man. Now because both these are grounded vpon the former cautions, therfore we con∣clude, that whatsoeuer busines is taken in hand, and not suted vnto them, it hath not good warrant, and so cannot be done with good conscience. Yet for better clearing of this answer, let vs a little consider the Scriptures, and the ex∣amples there recorded, touching this policie. In Iosh. 8. 5. we shall finde that Ioshua vseth
Martiall policie in the besieging of Ai, pla∣cing one part of his armie in an ambush, and causing the other part to flie: for by that meanes, the men of Ai comming out of the citie, and pursuing those that fled, the soul∣diors that lay in ambush, tooke the citie and destroied it. In 2. Sam. 5. 23. Dauid beeing to make warre against the Philistims, asketh counsell of God, and God teacheth him po∣licie; he therefore in his owne example al∣lowes policie; and more especially those wise and prudent shifts in warre, which we call Stratagms or policies of the field. We haue also the example of Paul for this pur∣pose, who Act. 21. 26. faines himselfe to haue made a vowe to be a Nazarite, that he might yeelde somewhat to the weakenes of the Iewes, who were not sufficiently infor∣med in the doctrine of Christian libertie. This practise was warrantable, neither was it a sinne in Paul: for he did it by the counsell of the Church at Ierusalem, v. 20, 24. And Paul himselfe neuer made mention of this, as of a sinne, which he would vndoubtedly haue done, had it beene sinne Againe, Act. 23. 6. when he was brought before Ananias the Priest, and the councell at Ierusalem, beeing in some danger, he vseth policie: for he pretended that he was a Pharisie, and by that meanes raised a dissension between the Pharisies and the Sadduces. And this was no sinne in Paul: for he spake no more but
the truth, onely he concealed part of the truth. Now if it fall out otherwise, that policie be vsed, and any of these foure Caueats be not obserued, then it looses both the name and nature of true Policie, and becomes fraud, craft, and deceit, and so is condemna∣ble. Example hereof we haue in Dauid, 1. Sam. 21. 14. who when he came to the court of Achish king of Gath, and saw himselfe in daunger, he faines himselfe madde. Which though he did to saue his owne life, yet his polie was not to be allowed of: for it ten∣ded to his owne disgrace, (he beeing King of Israel:) and it was also dishonourable vnto God, who had appointed him to be the king of Israel. Againe, that which is commonly called the policie of Machiavel, is here to be condemned. For it is not answerable to the Cauears before remembred. Besides that, it is not onely against the written law of God, but euen against the law of Nature. And the very foundation. thereof, standeth onely in the practise of lying, swearing, forswearing, in fraud, deceit, and injustice.
CHAP. III. Of Questions concerning Clemencie. CLemencie or meekenes, is a vertue, that serues to mode∣rate wrath and reuenge. Touching Clemency there be three Questions. I. How a man is to carrie himselfe, in respect of iniuries and offences done vnto him? II. When Anger is a sinne, and when not? III. How a man should remedie his rash and vniust anger? I. Question. How may a man carrie himselfe, in respect of iniuries and offences done vnto him? Aus. That a man may behaue himselfe so as becommeth a Christian in these cases, he must in the first place, inquire into the nature and qualitie of the wrong done. Now, Offences that are done to vs by o∣thers, are of three sorts. The first sort, and the least are, when some
things are done to vs, that do onely displease vs, but bring no losse or hurt to vs. These be light offences; and of this kind are common infirmities, as hastinesse, teastinesse, froward∣nesse, slownesse and dulnesse of nature; of this kind also, are reproches of vnskilfulnesse, ig∣norance, basenes, pouertie and such like. The first degree then of Clemency is, not so much as to take notice of these sleight offences; but to let them passe, and burie them in obli∣uion. Salomon saith, A mans vnderstanding deforreth his anger, and it is his credit to passe by an offence, Pro. 19. 11. his meaning is, that when small offences are done, which cannot be avoided, then in discretion a man should with hold his anger, and not take notice of them, but passe by them and let them goe: for this shall be a farre greater ornament vnto him, then if vpon the deede done, he should haue hastily proceeded to reuenge. The second sort of Offences, are small in∣iuries, such as doc not onely displease vs, but with all bring some little hurt to vs, either in our goods, life, or good name. Now, the se∣cond degree of meekenes is, to take notice of these, but withall to forgiue them and put them vp. The reason is, because alwaies grea∣ter care must be had of peace and loue, then of our owne priuate affaires. Read the pra∣ctise hereof, Ioh. 8. 49. It was obiected to Christ wrongfully, that he was a Samaritane, and had a Deuill. Christ takes knowledge of
the wrong, and saith, you haue reproched me; but withall he puts it vp, onely denying that which they said, and clearing himselfe, I haue not a Deuill, but I honour my father. Dauid had receiued great wrong, at the hands of Ioab and Shimei, as appeares in the historie of his life; but principally, when he came first to be King of Israel, a. Sam. 3. and yet he takes not a hastie course, presently to be reuenged vp∣on his adversaries: but proceedes in this or∣der. First, he takes notice of the fact, and com∣mits his cause to God, ver. 39. and then after∣ward, as opportunity serued, gaue the parties their iust desert. The reason was, because beeing newely invested in the kingdome, his adversaries were strong, and himselfe weake, euen by his owne confession, & ther∣fore not able at the first, to redresse the iniury done vnto him. But when he had once esta∣blished himselfe, then he doth not onely be∣ginne, 2. Sam. 19. 14. but proceedes to full execution of punishment vpon them, as we read 1. King. 2. ver. 5. 6. 34. 35. The third sort of Wrongs, are greater in∣iuries; such as are not onely offensiue to our persons, but withall doe preiudice our liues, and bring a ruine vpon our estates, both in goods and good name. These are the high∣est degree of Iniuties, manifested in open and apparent wrongs. And therefore answe∣rable to them, is required the third and high∣est degree of Clemencie, which stands in
three things. First, in taking notice: second∣ly, in forgiuing them: thirdly, in a iust and lawfull defending our selues against the wronging parties. This is the summe and substance of the answer. For the better conceiuing whereof, sun∣dry Questions are further to be propounded and resolued. First in generall; it is demanded, how a man should and ought to forgiue an iniurie? Ans. In forgiuenes there be foure things. The first is forgiuenes of Reuenge, that is of requiting euill for euill, either by thought word or deede. This must alwaies be practi∣sed. For vengeance is not ours, but the Lords, and great reason then, that we should euer∣more forgiue, in regard of reuenge and ha∣tred. This the Apostle teacheth, when he saith, 1. Cor. 13. 5. Loue is not provoked, it neuer thinketh, much lesse speakes or does, evill. The second is forgiuenesse of priuate pu∣nishment; which is, when men returne punish∣ment for iniuries done, in way of requitall; and this must alwaies take place with vs, be∣cause as vengeance it selfe, so also punishmēt in way of revenge, is Gods alone. The third is, forgiuenesse of iudgement, when we iudge an inurie done to be an iniu∣rie. This iudgement we are not bound to for∣giue vnto men. For we may with good con∣science, iudge a sinne and a wrong to be as they are. And yet notwithstanding, if a man
make satisfaction for the wrong done, then there ought to be forgiuenes, even in regard of iudgemen. The fourth is forgiuenesse of satisfaction. This we are not alway bound to remitte, but we may with good conscience, alway re∣quire satisfaction where hurt is done. Secondly, for the further clearing of this generall Question, we are to answer some particular Cases vsually propounded in the liues of men, and namely fiue. I. Whether a man may defend himselfe by law? II. How he may defend himselfe by law? III. Whether a man may defend himselfe by force? IV. How? V. Whether a man may defend himselfe by Combate? I. Case. Whether a man may, with good conscience and a meeke Spirit, defend him∣selfe by law, for wrongs that are done vnto him? I answer affirmatively: A man may, with good conscience, defend himselfe against great iniuries, by the benefite of lawe. For Magistracie is Gods ordinance, for the good of men. Rom. 13. 4. and therefore men may vse the benefite of the authoritie, iudgement, and iurisdiction of Magistrates, without breach of conscience. Again, it is the expresse
lawe of God, that when a false witnesse ri∣seth vp against a man, to accuse him of a trespasse; that both the accuser and the accu∣sed, should stand before God, that is, before his Preists and Iudges for the time beeing, and haue remedie at their hands. An example of which iudiciall defense, we haue in Paul, who in case of wrong, makes his appeale to the iudgement seate of Rome. Act. 25. 10. But it is alleadged out of Scripture, to the contrarie, Luk. 6. 29. To him that smiteth thee on the one cheeke, offer also the other, Mat. 5. 40. If any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coate, let him carry thy cloake also. Ans. These places are spoken of priuate persons, that want the defense and assistance of the publicke Magistrate; and such must rather suffer wrong vpon wrong, blow vpon blow, and losse vpon losse, then right their owne wrongs, by reuenging themselues. Againe, it is obiected, that Paul saies, Law∣ing is a fault, 1. Cor. 6. 7. There is vtterly a fault among you, because ye goe to law one with an other, &c. Ans. We must distinguish between things themselues, and the manner of doing them. When Paul saies, it is a fault, he condemneth not lawing absolutely in it selfe, but the Co∣rinthian manner of going to law: which was this. First, they went to law with scandall, be∣fore the Tribunalls of Heathenish and vnbe∣leeuing Iudges, and so made the Gospell to
be slandered and reproched. Secondly, they went to law vpon light causes, and for small iniuries, which they might well haue put vp, & easily brooked. Thirdly, in lawing they fell into rash and violent passions of rage, and enuie, so as they could not temper them∣selues, but must needes goe to law in the first place; which should rather haue been the last and the desperatest remedie of all. And this bad manner of suing one another at the law, is it which Paul rebukes as a fault. And it is to be obserued, that Paul notes their fault by a word, that signifies . Weakenesse or impotencie of their affections, whereby it came to passe, that being ouercome by the strength of their owne desires, vpon iniuries offered, they were vnable to beare them in any degree of Chri∣stian moderation, and there vpon hastily pro∣ceeded to the Courts of Heathen Iudges, for determination of controversies and conten∣tions among them. It is further alleadged, that when a man is any way wronged, it is Gods will it should be so, and therefore he ought not to seeke re∣dresse, but to rest himselfe in the will, of God. Ans. It is Gods will we should haue disea∣ses, and yet it is no lesse his will, that we should vse good means to be cured of them. So is it in wrongs and iniuries done vnto vs. As his will is, we should be afflicted, so also hath he willed our deliuerance, by such
meanes, as himselfe hath appointed. But our Sauiour would haue his Disciples, to be as sheepe among wolues, and therefore we ought to endure all wrongs without reuēge. For the sheepe takes all wrongs, and doth not so much as defend it selfe against the woolfe. Ans. So Christ commandeth, that we should be simple as doues, Matth. 10. 16. and yet withall, he commandeth vs to be wise as Serpents, to defend our owne heads, and to saue our selues. Lastly, it is alleadged, 1. Cor. 13. 5. that loue seekes not her owne: therfore loue must not defend her selfe. Ans. Loue doth not so seeke her owne things, as that shee neglecteth the good of o∣thers; but seeking her owne, shee seekes the good of all. And this practise is not against, but according to the law of Charitie. II. Case. How is a man to defend him∣selfe by Law? Ans. For the resoluing of this Question, we must take two Rules. The first is this. We must first trie all meanes, and vse all remedies that may be, before we vse the remedie of Law. It is our Sauiours direction, Matth. 5. 25. Agree with thine aduersarie quickely, while thou art in the way, that is, before the controuersie be ended by order of law. Againe, Matth. 18. 15. If thy brother trespasse against thee, goe and tell him
his fault betweene thee and him alone. And Saint Paul in this case, prescribes a course to be ta∣ken before-hand; namely, first to beare and suffer as much as may be, 1. Cor. 6. 7. Why ra∣ther suffer ye not wrong? why rather sustaine ye not harme? Then, if bearing will not ende it, to commit our cause to priuate arbitrement, of one or two, v. 5. Is it so that there is not a wise man among you, no not one that can iudge betweene his brethren? Law is to be vsed in this case, as the Physitian vseth polson, and that is, onely in desperate cases. The second Rule is, That our patient mind must be made knowne to all men, Phil. 4. 5. In taking the benefit of Law, we are to vse great Moderation of mind, and that in three respects; before we goe to law, in lawing, and when the suit is ended. The Moderation of mind, before the be∣ginning of suits in law, stands in three things. First, we must consider, that all iniuries whatsoeuer they be, doe befal vs by the pro∣uidence of God, and that for our sinnes. Vp∣on which consideration, we ought to submit our selues to Gods will, to obey him, to arme our selues with patience, and to lay aside all anger, enuie, malice, and impatience. Secondly, we must consider before-hand, that Courts of Iustice, are the ordinance of God, in which it pleaseth him to testifie his presence, iustice, and goodnes; and vpon
this ground, we shall be mooued to depart with our owne right, and to yeeld our selues, and all the right we haue, into the hands of God, in the vse of the meanes appointed; in the meane time depending on him by faith, for the issue and euent of our suit. And hence (by the way) it appeares, that few or none doe vse this ordinance of God, as they ought; because the greater sort of men, that commence suits in law, doe not consider either the nature, or ende of ciuill Courts. No man ordinarily will yeeld a haire of his right, but euery one sixeth his eyes wholly, vpon the euent of his action by ex∣tremitie of law: and so swarueth from that Christian moderation, required by the word of God in this case. Thirdly, we must set down with our selues, lawfull and iust endes of our actions, not vn∣iust and vnlawfull. These iust endes are; first, Gods glorie in the execution and manifesta∣tion of iustice: secondly, the honest defence of our owne right: thirdly, publike peace: fourthly, the amendment of disordered per∣sons, and not the defamation or hurt of any man. The Moderation of the mind in Lawing, stands in these particulars. 1. In seeking af∣ter peace to the vtmost, Rom. 12. 18. If it be possible, as much as in you is, haue peace with all men. 2. In loue of our enemies, with whom we are at controuersie in law. 3. In neither
vsing nor shewing extremitie in our procee∣dings, Matth. 5. 25. Matth. 18. 28. After that the suit is ended, the moderati∣on of our mindes must be expressed, by our behauiour, in regard of the euent of our a∣ction. For if the Law goe with vs, we are to giue God thankes for the manifestation of his iustice, in the course taken. If on the o∣therside it goe against vs, we may not rage or be discontentedly grieued, but commend our cause quietly to God, and accuse our selues for our owne sinnes, and say with Da∣uid, Righteous art thou, O Lord, and iust are thy iudgements. Psal. 119. 137. III. Case. Whether may a man defend himselfe by force, when he is wronged? Ans. In some Cases, he may lawfully de∣fend himselfe by force. Reasons. First, be∣cause the Gospel doth not abolish the Law of nature, nor the positiue lawes of all coun∣tries, but it doth establish them. Now, it is the Law of nature and nations, that a man may defend his life and health, in some ca∣ses, vpon iust occasion. Secondly, this is Gods Law, Exod. 22. 2. If a theefe be found breaking vp a house, and be smitten that he die, no blood shall be shed for him. Abraham was a stranger in the land of Sodom, and yet he re∣skued his brother Lot, and recouered all his substance that he had lost, by force & armes, Gen. 14. 14. and his action was approoued of God. For Melchisedeck met him, at his re∣turne
from the slaughter of the Kings, and blessed him. Yea and blessed God for his de∣liuerance, v. 19. 20. Againe, in some cases, a man may giue his life for his brother. So saies S. Iohn, 1. Ioh. 3. 16. We ought also to lay downe our liues for the brethren. IV. Case. When may a man defend him∣selfe by force? Ans. Not alwaies and vpon euery occa∣sion, but onely in these cases. First, when violence offered is so sudden and vnexpe∣cted, that when it comes, there can be no e∣scape, either by yeelding, or by flying, or by some suffering. Secondly, when the violence offered is open and manifest, so as there is no other way to reskue our selues, but by stri∣king or killing. Thirdly, when violence is offered, and the Magistrate absent; either for a time, and his stay be dangerous, or al∣together, so as no helpe can be had of him, nor any hope of his comming. In this case, God puts the sword into the priuate mans hands. Fourthly, when the defense is Iust, and done in a right manner. A Iust defense stands in these things. I. It must be done incontinent and forthwith, so soone as euer violence is offered. For if there be delay, and it come afterward, it loo∣ses the name of a iust defense, and becomes a reuenge, arising of prepensed malice, as the Lawyers vse to speake. II. There must be an intention, not to reuenge principally, or
to kill, but onely to defend himselfe. III. There must be a iust and equall proportion of weapons; therefore it is no iust defence to shoote a naked man through with a mu∣sket, or other peece of ordinance, when he offers violence. V. Case. Whether a man may reskue him∣selfe or others by Combate? Ans. It hath beene of ancient times, an v∣suall manner of defence in some countries, that in case of difference, betweene people and people, in matters of weight, two men should be chosen out among the rest, who by fighting hand to hand, and killing one an other, should ende the controuersie. But this way of defense, how auncient so euer it be, is vtterly vnlawfull. Reasons are these. First, it is the expresse commandement of God, Thou shalt not kill. In which, all priuate men are forbidden to kill or slay, but in the case of iust and neces∣sarie defense. Secondly, we may not hazard our liues, without some speciall warrant frō God: if we doe, it is a flat tempting of God: and this is done in euery combate. Thirdly, if Magistrates will permit such fights as this is, then they are bound to defend and saue the life of the innocent. For by such permission, oftentimes innocent blood is shedde, and the more harmelesse partie goes by the worst. But it will be, and is obiected. First, that a
Combate is a triall of innocencie. Ans. It is not so. For he that is stronger vsually ouer∣comes in the combate, not he that hath the more righteous cause. Againe, there be o∣ther meanes to trie a truth, besides this; as by examination, and by oath. Lastly, triall by the combate, is of the same nature with the triall of a murtherer by the bleeding of a corpes touched, or handled, which is very doubtfull, and of all other most vncer∣taine, Secondly, it is alleadged, that if a man take not a chalenge, he is disgraced for euer. Ans. There is no warrant in Gods word, for a priuate man to accept a chalenge. Nay, it is rather flat against the word. For God saies, Reuenge is mine. The priuate man saies the contrarie, The wrong is mine, and I will be auenged of him that hath done it. Again, it is better for any man, to indure a little re∣proch with some men, then to loose or ha∣zard his life. Thirdly, it is obiected, that the Philistims offered to trie the victorie by a single com∣bate with the Israelites, and appointed Go∣liah (on their side) to giue the Chalenge; and that Dauid (on the Israelites side) accepting the chalenge, encountred with him, and had good successe. It may seeme therefore, that combates are lawfull.. For it is better that one man should perish in warre, then that a whole armie should miscarie. Ans. That was
a speciall and extraordinarie example of tri∣all, and Dauid was a champion in that fight, not by ordinarie appointment, but by extra∣ordinarie prophetical instinct of Gods spirit. Againe, in warre, though there be lesse danger in hazarding one mans life, then a whole armie: yet a good & iust cause is to be main∣tained, with all the strength that may be made, and not to depend vpon the power and courage of one man, who, in probabili∣ty, vnlesse he be supported by speciall cal∣ling and assistance from God, may be ouer∣come and loose the victorie. Fourthly, it is alleadged, that an armie may fight against an army therfore one man against an other. Ans. The reason is not alike. For warres and armies are Gods ordinances, and so are not combates; and it is not Gods will, that men should deuise and establish new waies and meanes of triall, not allowed by his word, but rather rest content with that he hath appointed. Fiftly, Ionas did hazard his life, by casting lots; therfore a man may by combate Answ. To say that Ionas did put his life in hazard by lottes, is an vntruth. For there was onely a coniecturall triall made, who should be the cause of the present danger. And when the lot fell vpon him, he was not cast into the sea by the lotte, but by his owne advise and counsell. Againe, the casting of Ionas into the sea, did not befall him by lotte, but by his
owne voluntarie resignation of himselfe, into the hands of God; willingly vndergoing it, as a iust punishment of the neglect of his cal∣ling; which himselfe confessed in these words, For I acknowledge, that for my sake the great tempest is vpon you, Ion. 1. 12. Sixtly, Moses and the Egyptian fought a combate, and Moses slew him. Ans. Moses took vpō him publike revenge in this action, as a Magistrate, and not priuate, as a priuate man. For though as yet, his calling was not fully manifested to his brethrē, yet the truth is, God had called him to be their deliuerer out of the hands of the Egyptians; and this very action was a signe of their deliuerance, which was to come to passe afterward. It was (I say) a signe, thus; As he defended his brother and avenged his quarrell vpon the Egyptian, so in time to come the Lord would by his hand, giue them full freedome and deliuerance from the tyranny of Phara∣oh, and all his and their enemies, Act. 7. 25. Beeing then a publicke person, his example can prooue nothing for this purpose. II. Question. When Anger is a vertue, and so, good and lawfull, and whē it is a vice, & consequēt∣ly euill and vnlawfull?
This Question hath two distinct parts: of which I will speake in their order. Sect. 1. The first part is, when Anger is a vertue & lawfull? For Answer hereof, we must vnderstand, that in iust and lawfull Anger, there be three things; a right Beginning or motiue; a right Obiect; and a right Manner of beeing an∣gry. To the right Beginning of anger, three things are required. First, that the occasion of anger be iust and weightie, as namely, a manifest offence of God. Take an exāple, or two. Moses in sundry places, is said to be angrie, & the occasions of his anger were great, as appeares in the par∣ticulars. First, because some of the Israelits, a∣gainst Gods commandement, had reserued Manna till the next day, Exod. 16. 20. Again, he was angrie, because the Israelites had tempted God, in worshipping the golden calfe, Exod. 32. 19. In Numb. 16. 15. Moses againe is wroth, because Coreh, Dathan, and Abiram rebelled against him, and in him a∣gainst God. Phinees, Numb. 25. 8. 11. is said to haue beene zealous, that is, angry for God: the occasion was, because the Israelites com∣mitted fornication with Heathenish wo∣men. Dauid in like manner, 2. Sam. 13. 20, 21. was angrie vpon this occasion, because
Ammon his sonne had deffoured his sister Thamar. Elias is angry, 1. King. 19. v. 14. and why? because the Israelites forsooke the conenant of God, cast downe his altars, and had slaine his prophets with the sword. Ne∣hemias, Chap. 6. ver. 5. is very angrie, because the Israelites oppressed one another with v∣surie, and other kinds of exactions. Ieremic also, Chap. 6. 11. was angrie for this, because the Israelites were of vncircumcised hearts & eares, and the word of the Lord was vnto them as a reproch, & they tooke no delight therein. Secondly, it is required, that anger be con∣ceiued vpon counsell and deliberation, Pro. 20. 18. Establish thy thoughts by counsell. If thoughts must be established by counsell, then the affections, & so our anger also. And the Apostle saith, Iam. 1. 19. Be slow to wrath. Now the reason is plaine; Counsell ought to be the foundation of all our actions, and therfore much more of our affections, which are the beginnings of our actions. Thirdly, iust and lawful anger must be kin∣dled and stirred vp by good and holy affe∣ctions, as namely, by desire to maintaine the honour and praise of God, by the loue of iu∣stice and vertue, by hatred and detestation of vice, and of all that is evill. One saith well to this purpose, that anger must attend vpon vertue, and be stirred vp by it against sinne, as the dogge attends vpon the sheepeheard,
and waites vpon his eie and hand, when to follow him, and when to pursue the wolfe. The Second thing in good anger, is a fitte Obiect or Matter to worke vpon; touching which, two thing must be remembred. First, we must put a difference betweene the person, and the offence or sinne of the per∣son. The sinne of the person is the proper ob∣iect of anger, and not the person, but only by reason of the sinne. Thus Dauid saies of himselfe, that he was consumed with anger, not because the men with whome he was angrie, were his enemies, but because they kept not Gods law, Psal. 119. 139. Thus Moses was an∣grie at the Idolatrie of the Israelites, where∣with they had sinned against God fourtie daies togither; & yet he praies earnestly vnto God, for their persons, as we read, Exod. 32. But it is alleadged to the contrarie, that Dauid directs his anger against the persons of his enemies, especially in Psal. 109. Answ. First, Prophets (as hath beene saide hereto∣fore) were endued with a speciall measure of zeale; and their zeale was a pure zeale, ta∣ken vp specially for the glorie and honour of God; but our zeale against our enemies, is commonly mixt with hatred, enuy, and selfe∣loue, therefore we must not, nay we cannot follow their examples. Secondly, imprecati∣ons vsed by Dauid, were predictions ra∣ther then praiers: for he rather foretold in them what should come to passe, then
prayed that it might come to passe. Thirdly, Dauid in his imprecations, accurseth not his owne priuate enemies, but the enemies of God, and not al them, but such onely as were incurable: for by the spirit of prophecie, he knew the state of those, against whome he did pray, so doe not we. Secondly, we must put a difference be∣tweene the cause and offence of God, and the cause and offence of man. Now iust anger must be directed against persons, for the offence of God properly, and not for priuate of∣fence, but onely so farre forth, as it tendeth to the offence of God. Thus Miiam and Aaron murmured against Moses, because he had married a woman of Aethiopia. But this was onely a priuate offence, and therefore Moses behaued himselfe meekely towardes them, Numb, 12. 3. The Third thing in good anger, is the Right Manner of conceiuing it. Wherein these Cautions are to be obserued. First, that our anger be mixed and tempered with cha∣ritie and loue. It is the propertie of God himselfe, in wrath to remember mercie, Hab. 3. 2. and herein we must be like vnto him. This was Moses his practise, who out of his loue praied for those, with whome he was angrie, Exod. 32. Secondly, anger against a∣ny offence, must be mixed with sorrow for the same offence. Thus Christ was angrie with the Iewes, but withall he sorrowed for
the hardnes of their hearts, Mark. 3. 5. The reason hereof is this. In any societie whatso∣euer it be, if one member sinneth, the sinne of that one member, is the punishment of the rest that be in that societie; euen as it is in the bodie, if one part be affected and ill at ease, the rest will be distempered. Paul saies of himselfe, that he was afraid, least when he came to the Corinths, God would humble him for their sinnes, 2. Cor. 12. 21. A∣gaine he teacheth, that those which are fal∣len into any fault, must be restored by the spirit of meekenes, because we our selues are subiect to the same tentations, Gal. 6. 1. And in this regard, he would haue men to mourne with them that haue in them the cause of mour∣ning, Rom. 12. 15. Thirdly, iust anger must be contained within the bounds of our par∣ticular calling, and civill decencie; that is, so moderated, as it makes vs not to forsake our duties which we owe to God and man, nor breake the rules of comlines. Thus Iacob was angrie with Laban, and yet he speakes and behaues himselfe as a sonne to his father, e∣uen in his anger, Gen. 31. 36. Ionathan was angrie with Saul his father, and yet he with∣drawes not any reuerent or dutifull respect from him, 1. Sam. 20. Sect. 2. The second part of the Question is, When Anger is a vice and vnlawfull?
Ans. It is a sinne in fiue regards, contrary to the former. First, when we conceiue it without coun∣sell and deliberation. This rash, hastie, sudden and violent anger, is condemned by our Sa∣uiour Christ, Mat. 5. 22. Whosoeuer is angry with his brother vnaduisedly, shalbe culpable of iudg∣ment. Secondly, when it is conceiued for no cause, or for a light or trifling cause. Prou. 10. 12. Loue couers a multitude of sinnes. There∣fore euery light offence, must not be the cause of open anger. Prov. 19. 11. It is the glory of a man to passe by some infirmities. Eccles. 7. 23. Take not notice of all the words that men speake, no not of all those which seruants speake vnto their masters. Besides that, causelesse anger is ma∣ny times forbidden in the Scripture. And Paul saies, that loue is hardly provoked, be∣cause it will not be mooued to conceiue ha∣tred, but vpon weightie and important cau∣ses, 1. Cor. 13. Thirdly, when the occasion is iust, yet the measure of anger is immoderate. Eph. 4. 26. Be angry, & sinne not; and if by infirmitie thou fall into it, let not the Sunne goe downe vpon thy wrath. The reason is added in the next words, Giue not place to the Deuill; because he is al∣waies at hand to inflame the affection, as he did Sauls, who therefore in his rage, would haue killed him that was next him. Fourthly, when it makes vs to forget our
dutie to God or man, and to fal to brawling, cursing, and banning. Thus was Shemei an∣gry, when he railed vpon the King and flung stones at him and his seruants, giuing him bad and vnreuerent tearmes, and calling him a man of blood, and a man of Belial. 2. Sam. 16. 5. 6. 7. Thus did the Disciples forget their dutie of loue vnto their brethren, and in an∣ger desired that fire might come down from heauen, and destroy the Samaritanes, Luk. 9. 59. Thus the Iewes, in vndecent and vncha∣ritable manner, gnashed with their teeth at Steven, Act. 7. 54. And Saint Paul saies, that the fruites of wicked anger, are clamors, and crying speeches between person and person in their fury, Eph. 4. 31. And thence it is, that we find Balaam in his anger, to haue beene more void of reason then his asse, Numb. 22. 27. Fistly, when we are angrie for priuate re∣spects concerning our persons, and not con∣cerning the cause of God. Thus Cain is said to be exceeding wrothe, and to haue his countenance cast downe, onely vpon a pri∣uate respect, because he thought his brother Abel should be preferred before him, Gen. 4. 5. Thus Saul was wrath with Dauid, taking himselfe to be disgraced, because the people (after the slaughter of the Philistimes) ascri∣bed to Dauid ten thousand, and to him but a thousand. 1. Sam. 18. 7. In like manner he was angrie with Ionathan, for his loue that he
bare to Dauid, and for giuing him leaue to goe to Bethleem, 1. Sam. 20. 30. Thus Nebu∣chadnezars wrath was kindled against the three children, because he tooke himselfe to be contemned of them, Dan. 3. 19. Thus Ha∣man. meerely in regarde of priuate disgrace, growes to great indignation against Morde∣cai, Esther. 3. v. 5. Thus Asa was angry with the Prophet Hanani, because he thought it a discredit to him, to be reprooued at his hand, 2. Chron. 16. 10. And in this sort, were the Iewes filled with wrath at Christs reproofe, Luk. 4. 28. shewing thereby, as it is truly ex∣pounded by the Commenter, that they were very hotte in their own cause, and not in the cause of God. III. Question. What is the Remedie of vniust Anger? Ans. The Remedies thereof are twofold. Some consist in meditation, and some in pra∣ctise. Sect. 1. The Remedies that stand in Meditation, are of three sorts; some doe concerne God, some our neighbour, and some our selues. The Meditations cōcerning God; are spe∣cially sixe. I. Meditation. That God by expresse cō∣mandement
forbiddes rash and vniust anger, and commandeth the contrarie, namely, the duties of loue. Read for this purpose, Mat. 5. 21. 22. where we may obserue three degrees of vniust anger. The first whereof is, that which is inwardly conceiued, and not out∣wardly shewed. The second, when vniust anger shewes it selfe by signes of contempt, as by snuffing, rushing, changing and casting downe of the countenance. The third, is rai∣ling (thou foole) which is culpable of Gehen∣na fire, the highest degree of punishment. Now all these three degrees are murther; and the punishment of a murtherer is, to be cast into the lake of fire, Rev. 21. 8. Againe, Christ commandeth vs to reward good for euill, to blesse them that curse vs, and to doe good to thē that hate vs, if we will be the children of our Father which is in heauen, Mat. 5. 45. And S. Paul wisheth vs, to ouercome evill with goodnes, Rom. 12. 21. II. Meditation. That all iniuries which befall vs, doe come by Gods providence, whereby they are turned to a good ende, namely, our good. Thus David saith, that God had bidden Shemei to curse him, 2. Sam. 16. 10. And this was the ground of Christs re∣proofe of Peter, Shall I not, (saith he) drinke of the euppe which my Father hath giuen me to drinke of? Ioh. 28. 11. III. Meditation. God is long-suffering, even towards wicked men; & we in this point
must be followers of him. In regard of this, God is said to be mercifull, gracious, slow to anger, abundāt in goodnes & truth, Exod. 34. 6. Hence it was, that he spared the old world 120 yeres, . Pet. 3. 19. He spared the Israelits, after their Idolatrie, 390 yeres, Ezek. 4. 5. Be∣sides this, we haue example of the lowlines & long suffering of Christ, who saith, Matth. 11. 29. Learne of me, for I am humble and meeke: and of whome it is said, 1. Pet. 2. 22. When he was reuiled, he reuiled not againe, when he suffe∣red, he threatned not, but committed his cause to him that iudgeth righteously. Nowe because some may haply say, that these examples of God and Christ, are too perfect for man to followe, who cannot imitate God in all things? therefore besides them, consider fur∣ther the examples of some of the seruants of God. Moses, when the people mur∣mured at him, did not answer them againe by murmuring, but cried vnto the Lord, what shall I doe to this people? for they be almost readie to stone me, Exod. 17. 4. And Steuen, when he was stoned, praied for his enemies, Lord, lay not this sinne to their charge, Act. 7. 60. IV. Meditation is, concerning the good∣nes of God towards vs; an argument where∣of is this, that he doth euery day, forgiue vs farre more offences, then it is possible for vs to forgiue men. V. Meditation. All reuenge is Gods right, and he hath not giuen it vnto man.
Rom. 12. 19. Vengeance is mine, I will repay, saith the Lord. And man by reuenging his own quarell, makes himselfe both the iudge, the witnesse, the accuser, and the executio∣ner. VI. Meditation is, touching Christs death. He suffered for vs the first death, and the sorrowes of the second death; much more then ought we at his commandement, to put vp small wrongs and iniuries without reuenge. His commandement is, Resist not e∣uill, but whosoeuer shall smite thee on the right cheeke, turne to him the other also, Matth. 5. 39. Againe, Destroy not him with thy meate, for whome Christ died, Rom. 14. 15. The Meditations concerning our neigh∣bour, are two. The first, is the condition of him, with whome we are angrie, namely that he is a brother. Let there be no strife be∣tweene me and thee, for we are brethren, Gen. 13. 8. Againe, he is created in the Image of God; we must not therefore seeke to hurt or destroy that Image. The second is, concer∣ning that Equitie which we looke for at the hands of all men. If we wrong any man, we desire that he would forgiue vs: and there∣fore we must forgiue him the iniurie that he doth vnto vs, without vniust anger. This is the very Law of nature, Whatsoeuer ye would that men should doe vnto you, euen so doe you vnto them, Matth. 7. 12. Meditations concerning our selues, are
sixe. First, he that conceiueth rush anger, makes himselfe subiect to the wrath of God, if he cherish the same without relenting. Matth. 6. 15. If ye doe not forgiue men their trespasses, no more will your father forgiue you your trespasses. And, Matth. 7. 2. Iudge not, that ye be not iudged. Yea, when we pray to God to forgiue vs, and doe not resolue to forgiue our brethren, we doe in effect say, Lord condemne vs, for we will be condemned. Secondly, we are commanded to loue one another, euen as Christ hath loued vs, Eph. 5. 2. It is the propertie of loue, to suffer, and to beare, and not to be prouoked to anger, 1. Cor. 13. And it is a marke, whereby Gods children are discerned, from the children of the Deuill, that they loue their brethren, 1. Ioh. 3. 10. Thirdly, we are ignorant of mens mindes in speaking and doing: we know not the manner and circumstances of their actions. And experience teacheth, that much anger comes vpon mistaking and misconstruing them. Whereas contrariwise, if they were throughly knowne, we would not be so much incensed against men, as commonly we are. Fourthly, in rash anger, we can doe no part of Gods worshippe that is pleasing to him. We cannot pray: for he that praies, must lift vp pure hands without wrath, 1.
Tim. . 8. We cannot be good hearers of the word: for S. Iames wisheth vs to be swift to heare, and slow to wrath; because the wrath of man doth not accomplish the righteousnes of God, Iam. 1. 20, 21. Fiftly, we must consider what are the fruits and consequents of vniust anger. For first, it greatly annoies the health. It annoies the braine, and pulses; it causes the gall to flow into the stomacke and the bowells; it killeth and poisoneth the spirits; and it is the next way to procure distemper of the whole bo∣die, and consequently losse of health. Se∣condly, it makes a man captiue to the Deuill, Eph. 4. 27. which we see to be true in Sauls example, who beeing a man full of wrath, and giuing place to his owne rage and furie, an euill spirit entred into him by the iust iudgement of God. Sixtly, we must consider the Causes of vn∣iust anger. It is commonly thought, that An∣ger is nothing but the flowing of choler in the gall, and in the stomacke. But the truth is, anger is more then choler. For it riseth first, of a debilitie of reason and iudgement in the minde. secondly, from euill affections; as from enuie, and selfe-loue. thirdly, from the constitution of the bodie, that is hote and drie. Againe, we read in histories, that men hauing no gall, haue notwithstanding beene full of anger: and choler indeede is a furthe∣rance, but no cause of anger.
Sect. 2. The Remedies of vniust anger that stand in Practise, are especially fiue. The first is, in the time of anger to con∣ceale the same; both in word and deede. The indignation of a foole (saith Salomon, Prou. 12. 16.) will be knowne the same day; but the wise man couereth his shame: that is, he restraines his an∣ger, which if it should presently break forth, wold be a reproch vnto him. Answerable to this notable speech of Salomon, was the wise counsell of Ambros. de obit. Theod. Ambrose to Theodosius; that after sentēce giuen, he should take 30 daies respite before execution. And not vnlike hath been the practise of the very Heathen in their time. Socrates said, I had beaten thee, but that I was angrie. Aenodoru gaue Augustus this rule, that when he was angrie, he should first say ouer the whole Alphabet, before he put in execution his anger. Secondly, we must depart from them with whō we are angry. For this affectiō is as a fire; take the matter away from fire, and it will cease to burne; so let a man depart, and em∣ploy himselfe (for the time) some other way, and he shall soone cease to be angrie. Thus did Ionathan depart out of his fathers pre∣sence, 1. Sam. 20. 34. Abraham in his anger withdrew himselfe from Lot, Gen. 13. Ia∣cob in wrath departed from Esan, Gen. 27. 43, 44.
Thirdly, we must auoide the occasions thereof; as contentions, and contentious persons. Doe nothing through contention, Phil. 2. 3. Make no friendship with an angrie man, nei∣ther goe with a furious man, least thou learne his waies, and receiue destruction to thy soule, Prou. 22. 26. We must, for this purpose, be carefull to auoid all meanes, that may serue to fur∣ther the heate of the temperature of such a bodie, as is apt and disposed to this vnruly passion. Fourthly, we are to consider that we sinne against God, not once or twise, but often, yea euery day, and therefore the course of our anger must be turned against our own selues, for our sinnes. For this is one propertie of true repētance, to work in vs a reuenge vpon our selues, in regard of our sinnes committed against God, and our brethren. 2. Corinth. 7. 11. Fiftly, we must accustome our selues to the daily exercises of inuocation of the name of God, for this end, that he in mercie would mortifie all our affections, especially this corrupt & violent affection of vniust wrath. And this must we doe, as at all times, so then especially; when anger is creeping vpon vs. It will be saide of some; Our anger is vio∣lent, and comes vpon the sudden, and there∣fore these remedies will doe vs no good. Ans. Such persons, when their mindes be
quiet, must often read and meditate of the foresaid remedies, and by this meanes they shall be able to preuent hastines. But what if we be ouertaken with anger, what must we then doe? Ans. If thou fall into it through infirmitie, yet remember thy selfe, let not the sunne goe downe vpon thy wrath, Eph. 4. 26. Consider with thine owne heart, that anger is as a poison; if a man drinkes poison, he must not suffer it to rest, and flow into the bodie & veines, but with all speede must purge it out; and so must an∣ger be dealt withall, whēsoeuer we are ouer∣taken with it. CHAP. IIII. Of Questions concerning Temperance. TEmperance is a vertue, that moderateth appetite or lust. And this modera∣tion of appetite, stands in foure things. I. In the vse of Ri∣ches. II. In the vse of Meat and Drinke. III. In the vse of Apparell. IV. In the vse of Pleasures; wherein Re∣creations
are to be considered. Sect. 1. Concerning the Moderation of Appetite in the vse of Riches, there are two maine Questions. I. Question. How farre a man may, with good conscience, proceed in the desiring and seeking of Ri∣ches? The Answer of this Question is the rather to be considered, because this doctrine right∣ly conceiued and vnderstood, serues greatly for the direction of the whole course of our liues vnto the ende. Here therefore I will first set downe the Ground of the Answer, and then the Answer it selfe. The Ground of the Answer, I propound in fiue Rules. I. Rule. We must consider, that riches and goods, are of two sorts: some are necessarie, some are more then necessarie, which the Scripture calls Abundance. Goods and riches are two waies necessa∣rie; necessarie to nature, or necessarie to the person of a man. Goods necessarie to nature, are those, without which nature and life can∣not be well preserued; and these are most
needefull. Necessary in respect of a mans per∣son, are those goods, without which a mans state, condition, and dignitie wherein he is, cannot be preserued. Now Riches more then necessarie; I terme those, without which both the life of man, and his good estate, may well be preserued. And whatsoeuer is besides them, is necessary. For example. To the calling of a Student, meat, drinke, and cloth, are necessarie in re∣spect of nature; besides these, other things, as bookes, and such like, are also necessarie for him, in respect of his condition and place. II. Rule. Things and goods, are to be iudged necessarie and sufficient, not by the affection of the couetous man, which is vnsa∣able, but by two other things; the iudge∣ment of wise and godly men, and the exam∣ples of sober and frugall persons. III. Rule. We must not make one measure of sufficiencie of goods necessarie for all per∣sons; for it varieth, according to the divers conditions of persons, & according to time and place. More things are necessarie to a publicke man, then to a priuate; and more to him that hath a charge, then to a single man. IV. Rule. That is to be iudged necessarie, which in some short time to come may be needefull, though it haue no present vse. For example; the dowrie that a father giues to his daughter at the day of mariage, though it be not presently needefull, yet because in short time it may be necessarie, therefore it is to be
reputed amongst necessarie goods. V. Rule. We our selues doe often erre in iudgement, in determining of things neces∣sarie and sufficient for our selues: & therfore when men seeke things competent & neces∣sarie, they must alwaies pray to God, to giue them that, which he knowes in his wisdome, to be meete and necessarie, not prescribing a measure vnto him. I come now to the Answer of the Questi∣on, which is twofold. The first is this. Man may with good con∣science, desire and seeke for goods necessa∣rie, whether for nature, or for his person, ac∣cording to the former rules; but he may not desire and seeke for goods more then neces∣sarie; for if he doth, he sinneth. The reasons of this answer are these. First, Deut. 17. 16. 17. the commandement is giuen to the King, that hath most neede of abundance, that he should not multiply his horses or his siluer or his gold. That which the King may not doe, the subiects ought much lesse to doe; & therfore they are not to multi∣ply their goods. For this cause it is a great fault in subiects, remaining (as they be) subiects, to seeke to attaine to the riches of Princes. A∣gaine, Paul saith, 1. Tim. 6. 8. Hauing foode and raiment, let vs be therith content. Besides that, in the petition, Giue vs this day, &c. we craue but onely bread for our substance, that is meete to preserue vs for nature, in that calling wherein we serue God day by day.
The prayer of Agur is, that God would giue him foode conuenient for him, or (as the wordes signifie) bread of his statute, that is, which God in his counsell had appointed and ordained for him, Prov. 30. 8. Secondly, seeking of abundance is a ha∣zard to the saluation of the soule, by reason of mans corruption. Therefore, Matth. 13. Riches are called thornes, that choke the word of God sowen in the heart. And 1. Tim. 6. 9. They that will, that is desire to be rich, and content not themselues with things necessa∣rie, fall into the snare of the Deuill. Thirdly, seeking of abundance, is a fruite of diffidence in the prouidence of God. Now all frutes of vnbeleefe must be cut off; we must not therefore desire more then ne∣cessarie. In the next place, for the better clearing of this doctrine, the Obiections of Couetous men are to be answered. Obiect. I. Good things are to be sought for; but abundance is a good thing, and a blessing of God. Ans. Good things are of two sorts. Some are simply good, that is to say, good both in themselues and to vs; as re∣mission of sinnes, holinesse, righteousnesse, and life euerlasting in the kingdome of hea∣uen, and such like: these may we desire, and seeke for. Som again, are good onely in part, which though they be good in themselues, yet are not alwaies good to vs. Of this kind is
abundance of riches, and store of wealth more then necessarie for nature and person. For which cause, riches in abundance, are as the knife in the hand of a child, likely to hurt, if it be not taken away; because they are (in some men) occasions of sinne, vnlesse God in mercie preuent and hinder them. And for our selues, what know we, whether God will keepe and preserue vs from sinne, when we seeke and labour for abundance? Obiect. II. It is the promise of God, that riches and treasures shall be in the house of the iust, Psal. 112. 3. The answer is two-fold. First, riches in Scripture sometimes, doe signifie only things sufficient and competent, and of them is that place to be vnderstood. To this purpose Dauid saies, that a small thing, that is, a com∣petent and meane portion, though but very little, is to the iust man better then great riches to the wicked and mightie, Psal. 37. 16. And whereas Dauid in another place affirmeth, that nothing shall be wanting to them that feare God, Psal. 34. 9. and againe, They which seeke the Lord shall want nothing that is good: the pla∣ces are to be vnderstood with exception of the crosse & correction, in this sort; that they shall haue competencie, vnlesse the Lord in∣tend to chastice and correct them by want. Secondly, if by riches Dauid there meaneth abundance, the words must be vnderstood with this condition; if they be for their
good. For so all promises of temporal things must be limited with exception, partly of Gods glory, kingdome, and will, and partly of our good and saluation. Obiect. III. We must doe good to the poore, to the Church, to the common wealth, and we must also leaue somewhat to poste∣ritie. I answer: we may not doe euill that good may come thereof. Againe, euery man is accepted of God, according to that he hath, and not according to that he hath not, if there be a ready mind, 2. Cor. 8. 12. And the end of a mans calling, is not to gather riches for himselfe, for his familie, for the poore; but to serue God in seruing of man, and in seeking the good of all men; and to this end, men must apply their liues and labours. Obiect. IV. We are called to imitate the Ante, Prov. 6. & 13. which gathers in one season, for her reliefe in another. Ans. The Ante gathers in sommer, only things neces∣sarie; she doth not, by the instinct of nature, seeke superfluitie and more then is necessa∣rie. This doctrine serues to direct and in∣forme almost all the world, to beate downe the wicked practise of the vsurer, & to teach euery one of vs, to moderate our care in things pertaining to this life. The Second part of the Answer is this: If God giue abundance, when we neither de∣sire it, nor seeke it, we may take it, hold and
vse it as Gods stewards. Abraham & Ioseph of Arimathaea, are commended for their ri∣ches, and yet they obtained them not by their owne seeking, and moiling, after the manner of the world; but walking in their callings, God in his providence blessed and multiply∣their wealth. For further proofe of this an∣swer consider but one only place, Act. 5. 4. Where Peter saies to Ananias, When it remai∣ned, appertained it not vnto thee? and when it was sold, was it not in thy power? These words import thus much; that if we haue possessions and a∣bundance, we may with good conscience in∣ioy them as blessings and gifts of God. Against this doctrine it is alleadged first, that our Sauiour saies, It is a hard thing for him that hath riches, to enter into the kingdome of God, Matt. 19. 23. Ans. The place is to be vnderstood of them, that trust in their riches, as it is expounded, Mark. 10. 24. Secondly, it is obiected, we must forsake all and become Christs disciples, by the com∣mandement of Christ, Luk. 14. 26. Ans. A man must forsake al, not simply, but in regard of the daily disposition and preparation of his mind; and so a man ought to forsake the things that are dearest vnto him, because he must haue his minde resolued to forsake them. Againe, man must be content to part with all, not onely in affection, but actually, when it commeth to this point, that either he must loose them, or renounce Christ.
Thirdly, it is alleadged, that Riches are called vnrighteous, Luk. 16. 9. Make ye friends of vnrighteous Mammon: therefore it seemes we may not haue them. Ans. Mammon, is called Mammon of iniquitie, not because it is so in it selfe, but because it is so in the com∣mon vse, or rather abuse of wicked men: and that in sundrie respects. First, because it is commonly (though not alwaies) vniustly gotten: for it is a hard thing to become rich without iniustice. Secondly, it is made ordi∣narily, among sinnefull men, an instrument of many euills. Thirdly, euill gotten goods, are vniustly possessed, and no man can be truly tearmed rich, that vniustly possesseth riches. II. Question. How a man may, with good conscience, possesse and vse Riches! The Answer to this Question, I propound in foure Rules. I. Rule. They which haue riches are to consider, that God is not only their soueraigne Lord, but the Lord of their riches, and that they themselues are but the stewards of God, to em∣ploy and dispense them, according to his will. Yea further, that they are to giue an account vnto him, both for the hauing and vsing of those riches, which they haue and
vse. This Rule, is a confessed truth. In the pe∣tition, when we haue bread in our houses & hands, yea which is more, in our mouthes; when we are in the vse of the creature, euen then are we taught to say, Giue vs this day our daily bread, to signifie, that God is our soue∣raigne and absolute Lord, and that when we haue the creatures, we haue no vse of them, vnlesse he giue it vnto vs. Againe, the com∣mandement, Luk. 16. 2. Giue an account of thy stewardship; pertaines to all men that haue ri∣ches, though it be but meate and bread. II. Rule. We must vse speciall modera∣tion of minde, in the possessing and v∣sing of riches, & be content with our estate, so as we set not the affection of our heart vp∣on our riches, Psal. 62. 10. If riches increase, set not your heart vpon them; that is, place not your loue and confidence in them; be not puffed vp with pride and ambition, because you are rich, Luk. 6. 24. Woe be to you that are rich: that is, that put confidence in your ri∣ches, Matth. 5. 3. Blessed are the poore in Spirit. Now pouertie of Spirit is, to beare pouertie with meekenes, patience, and obedience, as a crosse imposed by God. And in this sense, the rich man may be said to be poore in spi∣rit, if he bestoweth not his loue and confi∣dence vpon his wealth, but in affection of heart is so disposed, as if he were not rich, but poore. And this pouertie is necessarie euen in the middest of wealth, because it will
restraine the furie of the vntamed and vnru∣ly affection. Againe, Christ saith, Matth. 10. 39. He that looseth his life for my sake, shall find it. Loosing there mentioned, is not an actuall loosing, but (as before) a disposition or pre∣paration of the heart to loose, for Christs sake, (if neede be) the dearest thing we haue, that is our life. And againe, Luk. 14. 26. If a∣ny man come to me, and hate not father and mo∣ther,—yea and his owne life also, he cannot be my Disciple. That place is not spoken of actu∣all, but of habituall hatred. And this stands in a readinesse and inclination of the heart to hate (if neede be,) father and mo∣ther, yea our owne life for Christ and the Gospels sake. To this purpose the Apostle saith, They that buie, must be as though they pos∣sessed not, 1. Cor. 7. 30. that is, in respect of mo∣deration of the affection, and the disposition of the heart. For otherwise, it is the Law of nature, that he that buies must possesse. Example of this moderation of the affe∣ction, we haue in Moses, who esteemed the re∣buke of Christ, greater riches then the treasures of Egypt, Hebr. 11. 26. And in Dauid, who though he were a King, and a Lord in the earth, yet saith of himselfe, that he was but a pilgrime and soiourner in it, as all his fathers were, Psal. 39. 13. And he speakes this in re∣spect of the affection of his heart, and mode∣ration thereof, because he did not fixe the same vpon abundance. And of Paul, who
professeth in this manner, I haue learned to be full, and to be hungrie: in all things I am instru∣cted, . or entred in this high point of Christi∣an practise, to be hungrie and to be full, Philip. 4. 12. In which text, two things are set down. First, that Christian moderation or content∣ment, is a high mysterie; yea that it requires much skill & arte to know, how to be poore and how to be rich. Secondly, that himselfe was a learner of this art, and that he had bin but entred and initiated into the knowledge thereof. Now, that this Moderation of minde may be learned and practised, we must remember that two especiall meanes are to be vsed. First, we must labour to be able to discerne betweene things that differ, Philip. 1. 10. How is that? by iudging aright betweene ri∣ches temporall, and the true riches, that will make a man rich before God. This gift of discerning was in Moses, who vpon a right iudgement in this point, accounted the re∣buke of Christ, greater riches, then the trea∣sures of Egypt, Hebr. 11. 26. In Dauid, who saies, that the Lord was his portion, when he was a King, and euen in the middest of his ri∣ches, Psal. 119. 57. In Paul, who esteemed the best things that were, but base, yea drosse and dung, that he might winne Christ, Phil. 3. 8. The Second meanes of Moderation is, to consider that we are in this world, as pil∣grimes and straungers, 1. Pet. 2. 11. that the
best of vs brought nothing into the world, neither shal (whē we dy) carry ought out of it. III. Rule. We must, vpon the calling of God, forsake our riches, and all that we haue in this world, not onely in disposition of minde, but in deede. The word of God teacheth, that there be three Cases, wherein a man is indeede to for∣sake all. I. If he be extraordinarily and immedi∣ately called, to publish the Gospel to all na∣tions. This was the case of the Apostles and Euangelists, who in regard of their calling, at least for vse, forsooke all that they had, Matth. 19. 27. II. In the Case of Confession; when for professing the name of Christ, a man is depri∣ued of them in the daies of triall. Thus when our Sauiour saith, Whosoeuer he be that forsa∣keth not all that he hath, &c. Luk. 14. 33. the words are spoken of all beleeuers, in the Case of Confession, when they are called by God vnto it; and therefore S. Matthew explaines it thus; Whosoeuer &c. for my names sake, he shall receiue, &c. Matth. 19. 29. III. When in the time of persecution, famine, or warre, the necessitie is so great, that it requires present releefe, which can no other way be had, but by giuing and selling the goods that a man hath. In Psal. 112. 9. the good man is saide to disperse to the poore; this dispersing must not be vnderstoode of all
times, but in case of extreame neede. Again, when Christ saies, Luk. 12. 33. ell al that thou hast; this cōmandement must be limited: for a man is not boūd to sel al at al times, but in the time of great and vrgent necessity. Thus the christiās in the Primitiue Church, in the daies of imminent persecution, sold all their pos∣sessions, Act. 2. And so Paul acknowledgeth, that the Church of Corinth releeued the Church of Macedonia, euen beyond their a∣bilitie, in the daies of extremitie that was in that Church, 2. Cor. 8. Here, another Question may be mooued; Whether a man may voluntarily, and of his owne accord, giue away all his goods, liue vpon almes, and giue himselfe to fasting and praier? Ans. He may in Popish conceit giue him∣selfe (in this sort) to voluntarie pouertie, which they hold to be lawfull, and (which is more) a state of perfection. We on the con∣trarie doe answer, that this practise is in no sort lawfull, vnlesse a man haue speciall cal∣ling and warrant from God so to doe. For first, the Law of nature sets downe and pre∣scribes distinction of possessions, and propri∣etie of landes and goods, and the Gospel doth not abolish the law of nature. Againe, the same distinction and proprietie, is allow∣able by the written Law of God. Salomon teacheth, Prou. 5. 15. that a man must let his waters flow out of his cisterne, but he must keepe
the fountaine to himselfe. And, Prou. 10. 22. It is the blessing of God to be rich, and he addeth no sorrowes to it. Men must not therefore volun∣tarily forsake their riches, and so bring sor∣row to themselues. Besides that, Agur praies against pouertie; Giue me (saith he) neither po∣uertie, nor riches, Prou. 30. 8. Dauid makes it a curse, to be a begger; Psal. 109. 10. and he neuer saw the righteous mans seede begging their bread, Psal. 36. 25. Our Sauiour Christ biddes him that had two coates, not to giue both a∣way, but one, Luk. 3. 11. And Paul saies, It is a more blessed thing to giue, then to receiue, Act. 20. 35. Therefore he biddes euery man to la∣bour with his owne hands, that he may neede nothing: that is, that he may not neede the re∣leefe and helpe of any man, or of anything, 1. Thess. 4. 11, 12. But it is alleadged to the contrarie, Matth. 19. 21. If thou n ilt be perfect, sell all. Ans. The wordes are a personall and particular com∣mandement. For this young Prince, whome Christ speakes vnto, was called to become a Disciple of Christ, and to preach the Gospel, Luk. 9. 59. And the commandement is not giuen generally to all men, but particularly to him alone: and we cannot make a gene∣rall rule of a speciall commandement or ex∣ample. Againe further, it was a commande∣ment of speciall triall. Secondly they alleadge, Matth. 10. 9. Pos∣sesse neither gold, nor siluer, nor money in your pur∣ses.
Ans. That commandement was tempo∣rall, and giuen to the Disciples, but onely for the time of their first embassage into Iurie, as appeares in the 5. v. where Christ bids them not to goe yet into the way of the Gentiles. And the commandements of their first em∣bassage, were reuersed afterward, Luk. 22. 36. Considering then that it belonged onely to their first embassage, when they preached to the Iewes, it was not giuen them for all times. IV. Rule. We must so vse and possesse the goods we haue, that the vse and possession of them, may tend to Gods glorie, and the sal∣uation of our soules. Rich men must be rich in good workes, and togither with their ri∣ches, lay vp a good foundation in consci∣ence, against the euill day, 1. Tim. 6. 18. For the better pactizing of this rule, take these three cautions. I. We must seeke to haue Christ, and to be in him iustified and sanctified: and beeing in him, then shall we in him and by him, haue the holy vse of all that we haue. Some will say; Infidels haue the vse of ri∣ches. Ans. They haue indeed, and they are to them the gifts of God: Yet they so inioy them, as that before God they are but vsur∣pers. They be gifts of God in regard of Gods giuing, but they are abuses and thefts in re∣gard of their receiuing, because they receiue them not as they ought. A father giues a gift
vnto his child, vpon condition that he shall thus and thus receiue it; now the child steales the gift that is giuen him, and therefore hath it not in that manner, that his father would he should haue it. In like manner doe Infidels steale and vsurpe the blessings of God, to which they haue no iust title, themselues be∣ing out of Christ, neither doe they vse them in that manner, which God requireth, sancti∣fying them by the word and prayer, 1. Tim. 4. 5. II. We ought to pray to God, that he would giue vs his grace, rightly to vse our ri∣ches to his glory, and our own saluation. For Riches and other temporall blessings, to sin∣full mē that haue not the gift to use thē wel, are dangerous, euen as a knife in the hand of a child. They are thornes, and choake the grace of God, they keepe those that trust in them, from entrance into the kingdome of heauen. Yea they are the deuills snare, where∣by he catcheth the wicked, & holdeth them in it at his will and pleasure. III. Our riches must be emploied to ne∣cessarie vses. These are First, the mainte∣nance of our owne good estate and conditi∣ons, Secondly the good of others, specially those that are of our family or kindred, 1. Tim. 5. 8. He that prouideth not for his owne, and namely for them of his houshould, he denieth the faith, and is worse then an Infidell. Thirdly, the releife of the poore, according to the state
and condition of euery man. Fourthly the maintenance of the Church of God, and true religion, Prov. 3. 9. Honour God with thy riches. Fiftly, the maintenance of the common wealth: Giue tribute (saith Paul) to whome tri∣bute belongeth, Rom. 13. 7. And giue vnto God, saith Christ, the things that are Gods, and vnto Casar, the things that are Caesars, Matt. 22. 21. Thus much touching the moderation of the appetite in the vse of riches. Sect. 2. In the second place follow those Questi∣ons, that concerne the Moderation of our Appetite, in the vse of Meate and Drinke. Concerning which, there are principally two; the answer to the first whereof is the ground of the second. I. Question. Whether there be any dif∣ference in the vse of Meates & Drinks, now in the times of the New Testament? Ans. There is a distinction and difference of Meates, to be obserued in sundrie respects. I. In respect of man, for healths suks. Paul counselleth Timothie; Drinke no more water, drinke a little wine, 1. Tim. 5. 23. In which it is plaine, that there is a distinction of meates
approoued and commended for man. For euery kinde of foode fittes not euery bodie: meates therefore are to be vsed with diffe∣rence. Man was not made for meate, but meate for man. II. In respect of scandall. Some are not to be vsed at some time, and some are at the same time to be eaten. Thus Paul profes∣seth, that rather then he would offend his brother, he would eate no flesh while the world endureth, 1. Cor. 8. 13. And in Rom. 14. he di∣sputes the point at large, touching the di∣stinction of meates, that is to be obserued, in regard of offending them that are weake. III. There is a distinction to be made, in respect of civill and politicke order; when for the common good of societies, certaine kindes of meates for certaine seasons of the yeare are forbidden. Thus in our commō wealth, there are appointed daies of flesh, & daies of fish, not in respect of conscience, but in regard of order, for the common good of the countrie. IV. There is a difference of meates, which ariseth vpon the bond of conscience, so as it shall be a sinne to vse or not to vse this or that meate. Touching this difference; Before the flood, the Patriarches (in all likelihood) were not allowed flesh, but only hearbs, and the fruit of the ground, Gen. 1. 29. After the flood, flesh was permitted, but blood forbid∣den, Gen. 9. 3. 4. From that time there was
commanded a dististinction of meates, wher∣of some were cleane some vncleane; which distinction stood in force till the death of Christ, and that in conscience, by vertue of diuine Law. But in the last daies, all diffe∣rence of meates in respect of obligation of the conscience, is taken away; and a free vse of all is giuen in that regard. This the Scripture teacheth in many pla∣ces, Act. 10. 15. The things that God hath puri∣fied, pollute thou not. Peter in these words tea∣cheth, that all meats in the new Testament in regard of vse, were made cleane by God, and therefore that no man by refusall of any kind of meates, should thinke or make them vn∣cleane. Againe, Rom. 14. 17. The kingdome of God is not meate or drinke, but righteousnes, peace and ioy in the holy Ghost. For whosoeuer in these things serueth Christ, is acceptable to God and ap∣prooued of him. Hence it appeareth, that in the Apostles iudgement, meat and drinke doth not make any man accepted of God, whe∣ther he vseth or vseth it not, but the worship of God is it that makes man approoued of him. To the same purpose it is said, 1. Cor. 8. 8. Meat doth not commend vs vnto God. Again, Col. 2. 16. Let no man condemne you in meat and drinke, &c. ver. 20. If ye be dead with Christ, why as if ye liued in the world, are ye burdened with Traditions, as Touch not, Tast not, Handle not? All which perish with the vsing. Here, Paul would not haue the Collossians burdened
with rites and Traditions concerning meats, so as if they vsed them not, they should in cur the blame and condemnation of men: but he would haue them to vse them freely and in∣differently. And his reason is double; First, because they were now freed in conscience, from the bond of the Ceremonial law touch∣ing meats; and therefore they were in con∣science much more freed from mens lawes. Secondly, because these traditions are not the rules and commandements of God, but the doctrine and precepts of men. Further∣more, Paul in 1. Tim. 4. 3. foretells, that there should be many in the latter daies, that should command to abstaine from meates. To which place the Papist answers, that that was, because such persons taught, that meats were vncleane by nature. But the words are simply to be vnderstood, of meates forbidden with obligation of the consci∣ence; and the text is generall, speaking of the doctrine, not of the persons of those men; nor in ciuill respects, but in regard of the bond of conscience. Lastly, it is a part of Christian libertie, to haue freedome in conscience, as touching all things indifferent, and therefore in regard of meates. To this doctrine, some things are opposed, by them of contrarie iudgement. Obiect. I. Princes doe make lawes, and in their lawes do forbidde meates and drinkes, and they must be obeyed for consciēce sake,
Rom. 13. 5. Ans. They doe so; but all these lawes are made, with reseruation of libertie of consci∣ence, and of the vse of that libertie to euery person. But to what end then (will some say) are lawes made, if they be made with reser∣vation? Ans. The scope of them is, not to take away, or to restraine libertie, or the vse of li∣bertie in conscience, but to moderate the o∣vercommon and superfluous outward vse. As for that text, Rom. 13. 5. It is to be vnder∣stood for conscience sake, not of the law of the Magistrate, but of the law of God, that bindes vs to obey the Magistrates law. Obiect. II. There was blood and things strangled forbidden, in the counsell at Ieru∣salem, after Christs ascension, Act. 15. Ans. It was forbidden onely in regard of offence, & for a time, so long as the weake Iewe remai∣ned weake, not in regard of conscience. And therfore afterward Paul saies, that all things euen blood it selfe was lawfull, though not expedient in regard of scandall, 1. Cor. 6. 12. And to the pure all things are pure, Tit. 1. 15. Obiect. III. Papists make lawes, in which they forbidde some meats, onely to restraine concupiscence. Ans. Then they should forbid wine, as well as flesh. For wine, spices, and some kindes of fish, which they permit, are of greater force to stirre vp lust, then the vse of flesh. And hence it is, that Saint Paul exhorts men not to be drunke with wine, wherein is
excesse, Eph. 5. 18. Againe, I answer, that Iust may be restrained by exhortation to tempe∣rance, without prohibitory lawes for the obligation of the conscience, which are flat against Christian libertie. Vpon this Answer a further Question may be made. Whether a man may with good conscience eate flesh at times forbidden? Ans. There are two kinds of eating; eating against the Law, and besides the law. Eating against the law is, When a man cats, and by cating hinders the ende of the law, contemns the authoritie of the law-ma∣ker, frustrates the law it selfe, and withall, by his eating, giues occasion to others to doe the same. This eating is a flat sinne against the fift commandement. For it is necessarie, that the Magistrates laws should be obeyed in all things lawfull. Heb. 13. 17. The master and the parent, must be obeyed in all lawfull things, much more the lawes of Magistrates. Eating beside the law, is, when a man eats that, which the law mentioneth and forbid∣deth, but not hurting the law. And that a man may thus eate, sundry cautions are to be ob∣serued. I. This eating must be vpon iust cause in a mans owne selfe. II. It must be without contempt of the lawmaker, and with a loy∣all mind. III. It must be without giuing of∣fence to any, by his bad example. IV. When it doth not hinder the maine end of the law.
V. When the eater doth subiect himselfe to the penaltie, voluntarily and willingly. In this eating, there is no breach in conscience, neither is it a sinne, to eate that which the law forbiddeth. For man hath free libertie, in conscience, to eat that which he doth eate. Now, if he vse his libertie, and hurt no law, obseruing these cautions, his eating is no sinne. For example. It was Gods law, that the Priests only should eat the shew-bread. Now Dauid vpon a iust cause in himselfe, (all the former cautions obserued) eates the shew-bread and sinnes not; because his conscience was free in these things; and therefore Da∣uids eating was not against the Law, but onely beside the law. II. Question. How we may rightly vse meates and drinks, in such sort as our eating may be to Gods glory, and our owne comfort? Ans. That we may so doe, some things are to be done before we eate, some in eating, & some after our eating. §ect. 1. The thing that is to be done before our ea∣ting, What is re∣quired be we eate. is the Consecratiō of the food, that is, the Blessing of the meates which we are to eate,
1. Tim. 4. 5, Euery creature of God is sanctified by the word of God, and prayer. By sanctification there, is not meant that, whereby we are san∣ctified by the holy Ghost: neither that, wher∣by the bread and the wine is halowed in the Sacrament of the supper. But it is this; when we are assured, that the creature is made so free, and lawfull to vs, in respect of our vse, that we may eate it freely, and with good conscience. By the word of God, Paul meanes the word of creation, mentioned in Gen. 1. 28. 29. & repeated, Gen. 9. 3. as also the word of God touching the libertie of conscience, namely that to the pure all things are pure, Tit. 1. 15. It is further added, and prayer, that is prayer grounded vpon the said word of crea∣tion, and the doctrine touching Christian li∣bertie; whereby wee pray for grace to God, that we may vse the creatures holily to his glorie. The reasons, why this sanctification of our meat is to be vsed, are these. First, that in the vse of it, we may lift vp our hearts vnto God, and by this meanes, put a difference between our selues and the brute beasts, which rush vpon the creatures, without sanctifying of them. Secondly, that we may be admonish∣ed thereby, touching the title we haue to the creatures, which beeing once lost by the fall of Adam, is restored vnto vs again by Christ. Thirdly, that it may be an assured testimony to our heartes, that we may vse the creature
with libertie of conscience, when we doe vse it. Fourthly, that we may be sanctified to the vse of the creature, as it is sanctified to vs, to the end, that we may vse it with temperance, and not abuse it. Fiftly, that when we vse the creature, we may depend on God for the blessing of it, to make it our nourishment. For no creature can nourish of it selfe, but by Gods commandement, who as Dauid saith, Psal. 145. 16. Openeth his hand, and filleth all things liuing of his good pleasure. And in bread, we must not consider the substance onely, but the staffe, which is the blessing of God vpholding our bodies. Sixtly, that we may not grow to securitie, forgetfulnes, and con∣tēpt of God, & so to prophanes in the vse of our meates and drinkes, as the Israelites did; which sate downe to eate and drinke, and rose vp to play. Now besides these Reasons, we haue also the Examples of holy men. This blessing of the meat, was so knowne a thing of auncient times, that the poore maides of Ramath-zo∣phim, could tell Saul, that the people would not eate their meate, before the prophet came, and blessed the sacrifice, 1. Sam. 9. 13. Christ in his owne family, would not eate of the fiue loaues and two fishes, till he had looked vp to heauen and geuen thankes. Mar. 6. 41. Paul tooke bread in the shippe, and gaue thanks in the presence of all that were with him. Act. 17. 35.
The Vse of the first point is. I. By this doctrine, all persons are taught, but specially gouerners of others, as Masters of families & Parents; neuer to vse, either meates or drinkes or any other blessing, that they receiue at the hands of God, but with praise & thanks∣giuing. For this which is said of meates and drinkes, must be inlarged also to the vse of a∣ny benefite, blessing, or ordinance, that we take in hand, to vse or inioy. II. Though we doe not simply condemne, but allow of Hal∣lowing of Creatures, yet we detest Popish consecration of salt, creame, ashes, and such like. First, because Papists halow them for wrong endes, as to procure by them remissi∣on of sinnes, to driue away deuills, &c. Se∣condly, because they sanctifie creatures without the word; yea though they doe it by praier, yet it is praier without the word, which giueth no warrant thus to vse the creatures, or to these endes; and therefore of the same nature with magical inchantments. Thirdly, if the creature must be sanctified for our vse, before we can vse it, then we our selues must be sanctified both in soule and bodie, before we can be sitte for the vse and seruice of God. Looke as the creature, by the hand and prouidence of God, is presen∣ted before vs to serue vs; so must we beeing strengthned and nourished by the same giue vp our-selues, soules, and bodies, to serue and honour him. Yea our sanctify∣ing
of the creature to our holy vse, should put vs in minde of sanctifying our selues to his glorie. So soone as the Prophet Esay was sanctified by God vnto his office, then he ad∣dressed himselfe and not before, and said, Lord, I am here, Esa. 6. 8. and so we our selues, before we can performe any acceptable du∣tie vnto God, must be purged and clensed. The sonnes of Aaron would not doe this ho∣nour vnto God, by sanctifying his name be∣fore the people, and therefore God glorified himselfe in their death, and temporall destru∣ction, Leuit. 10. 2. And when Moses the ser∣uant of God, failed in the sanctification of his name, by the circumcision of his sonne; Gods hand was vpon him to haue destroied him. This point is duely to be obserued of all, but principally of such as are appointed to any publike office; if they will serue God therein with comfort and incouragement, they must first labour to be sanctified before him, both in their soules and bodies. §ect. 2. I come now to the second thing, required What is re∣quired in our Eating. for the right and lawfull Vse of meates and drinkes, namely, a Christian behauiour while we are in vsing them. For the better vnderstanding whereof, we are to consider two points. First, what we may doe; and then, what we must doe in v∣sing the creatures.
I. Touching the former. We may vse these gifts of God, with Christian libertie: and how is that? not sparingly alone, and for meere necessitie, to the satisfying of our hunger, and quenching of our thirst, but also freely and liberally, for Christian delight and pleasure. For this is that libertie, which God hath graunted to all beleeuers. Thus we read, that Ioseph and his brethren with him, did eate and drinke together of the best, that is, li∣berally, Gen. 43. 34. And to this purpose Da∣uid saith, that God giueth wine, to make glad the heart of man, and oyle to make the face to shine, as well as bread to strengthen the bodie. Psal. 104. 15. And the Lord threatneth to bring a punishment vpon his people, Agg. 1. 6. in that he would giue them his creatures indeede, but such a portion of the, as should onely supplie their present necessities, and no more. Ye shall eate (saith he) but ye shall not haue enough: ye shall drinke, but ye shall not be filled. Againe, we read that Levi the Publi∣can, made our Sauiour Christ a great feast in his owne house. Luk. 5. 29. At the marriage in Caua a towne of Galile, where Christ was present, the guests are said, according to the manner of these countries, to haue drunke li∣berally. Ioh. 2. 10. And at an other place, in supper time, Marie is saide to haue taken a boxe of pretious and costly oyntment, and to haue annointed his feete there with, so as the whole house was filled with the sauour of the oint∣ment.
Ioh. 12. 3. Iudas indeede thought that expense which shee had made superstuous, but Christ approoues of her act, and com∣mendeth her for it. I adde further, that by reason of this liber∣tie purchased vnto vs by Christ, we may vse these and the like creatures of God, with Ioy and reioycing. This is the profit that redoun∣deth vnto man, in the vse of them, that he eate and drinke, and delight his soule with the profit of his labours. Eccles. 2. 24. The practise hereof we haue in the Acts, ch. 2. v. 46. where they of that Church that beleeued, are saide to eate their meate together with gladnesse, and singlenesse of heart. And yet this reioycing in the creatures, must be limited with this clause; that it be, in the Lord: that is to say, a hurtlesse and harmelesse ioy, tending to the glorie of God, and the good of our neigh∣bour. This condemneth the common pra∣ctise of the world, who solace and delight themselues in the vse of Gods creatures, but so, as with their ioy is ioyned the ordinarie traducing of the Magistrate, Minister, and those that feare God, and will not run with them to the same excesse of riot. 1. Pet. 4. 4. II. The second point is, what we must doe, when we take the benefit of Gods cre∣atures; a matter of great consequent in the liues of men. And it is this, that we vse our li∣bertie in the Lord, and whether we eate or eate not, we must doe both to the Lord. Rom.
14. 6. This is done by labouring, both in ea∣ting, and in abstinence, to approoue the same vnto God, vnto his Saints, and vnto our own consciēces. Wherein appeareth a mani∣fest differēce between the wicked & the god∣ly man. For the one, when he eateth or drin∣keth, he doth it in the Lord, and to the Lord; the other, doth it not to the Lord, but to himselfe, that is, to the satisfaction & con∣tentment of his owne carnall delight and pleasure. That a man may eate to the Lord, there are foure things distinctly to be obserued. I. That in our eating, we practise Iustice. Salomon saith, The bread of deceit, that is, got∣ten by vnlawfull meanes, is sweet vnto a man: but afterward, his mouth shall be filled with gra∣vell. Prov. 20. 17. And Paul giues a rule to the Church of Thessalonica, that euery man should eate his owne bread: that is, the bread which is procured and deserued, by his owne iust and honest labour, . Thess. 3. 2. This first thing, serues to checke a number of men, that liue in the daily practise of iniustice, by spending their goods in good fellowship, at Tauernes and ipling houses, neglecting (in the meane while) the maintenance of their own charge, by following their honest labour; and by this meanes, doe euen robbe their families, of their due and right. II. That we may eate to the Lord, we must practise Loue & Charitie in our eating.
How is that? First, we must giue offence to no man whatsoeuer. It is good, saith Paul, neither to eate flesh, nor to drinke wine, nor any thing, whereby thy brother stumbleth, is offended, or made weake. Rom. 14. 21. Secondly, in our eating we must haue re∣spect of the poore. Thus Nehemiah exhor∣teth the Iewes that were mourning for their sinnes, to be chearefull, to eate of the fat, and drinke the sweete, and send part vnto them, for whome none was prepared: that is, to them that were poore. Nehem. 8. 10. And the Prophet Amos, inueigheth against some of the Prin∣ces of Israel, who drunke wine in bowles, and annointed themselues with the chiefe ointments, and were not sorrie for the affliction of Ioseph: that is, did not releeue the poore brethren, that were led captiue, and wanted foode and maintenance. Amos 6. 6. III. We must vse our meate in Sobrietie. Sobrietie is a gift of God, whereby we keepe a holy moderation in the vse of our diet. Prov. 23. 1, 2. When thou sit test to eate, &c. con∣sider diligently, what is set before thee, and put the knife to thy throat, that is, be very carefull and circumspect in taking thy foode, bridle thine appetite, take heede thou doest not ex∣ceede measure. If it be asked, what Rule of moderation is to be obserued of all, whether they be men or women, young or old?
I answer. First, one mans particular exam∣ple, must not be a rule of direction to all. In the East countries, we read, that men haue li∣ued, and doe yet liue a great time with a lit∣tle; for example with parched corne and a cake. Now this example of theirs, is no rule to vs that liue in these parts. For their coun∣try is hotter then ours, and therefore lesse might serue them then vs: we are hot with∣in, and so our appetite is the more strong. A∣gaine, in eating we may not iudge or con∣demne him that eateth more, or lesse, then we our selues, because his eating is no rule to vs in this case. Secondly, a mans owne appetite, is not to be made a rule of eating for others. For a mā must not eate, so long as his stomacke craues meate; least he fal into the sinne of gluttonie, Rom. 13. 13. And this sinne is noted by our Sauiour Christ, to haue beene in the old world, in the daies of Noah, Mat. 24. 38. whē they gaue themselues to . eating and drinking like the brute beasts: for so the word signifies. If then neither example, nor appetite may rule our eating, what be the right rules of Christian moderation in this behalfe? Ans. That we may not exceede measure, we must keepe or serues within these limits. First, our food must not goe beyond the condition, place, abilitie, and maintenance that God hath giuen vs. Iohn the Baptist be∣ing in the wildernesse, contented himselfe
with very meane fare, agreable both to the manner of that countrey, and to his owne calling, and condition of life. His meate was locusts and wild hony. Mat. 3. 4. Secondly, it must be framed to the order and difference of time & place. Against this Rule the rich glutton offended, who fared deliciously euery day, without any difference of time or place, Luk. 16. Salomon pronoun∣ceth a woe to that Land, whose Princes eate in the morning, Eccl. 10. 16. S. Paul notes it a fauit in a Minister, to be . giuen to wine, 1. Tim. 3. 3. that is, a cōmon tipler, & one that loues to sit by the wine morning & euening, day by day. Thirdly, euery man must eat and drinke so much, as may serue to maintain the strength of his nature, of his bodie and mind, yea so much, as may serue to vphold the strength of grace in him. Salomon the King of Israel, would haue all Princes to eate in time, for strength, and not for drunkennes. Eccl. 10. 17. E∣say notes it as a iudgement of God vpon men, when they vse feasting and mirth, and haue not grace to consider the workes of God, Esay. 5. 12. Our Sauiour would haue all men so to eate and drinke, that they may be the fitter to watch and pray. Luk. 21. 34. 36. And the Apostle Paul exhorteth men, not to be drunke with wine wherein is excesse, but to be filled with the Holy Ghost, Eph. 5. 18. His meaning is, that men ought so to eate and drinke, that their bodies, mindes, and senses,
may not be made thereby more heauie, but rather more lightsome and able to performe their duties to God and man. For if they so eat, as that thereby they be hindred in this behalfe; they are guiltie of excesse and riot, which is greatly displeasing to God and of∣fensiue to men. This rule serueth to admonish somepersons, who (as the Prouerb is) are good forenoone-men, but bad afternoone∣men; because in the morning they be sober, but for the most part, ouer come with drinke after dinner. IV. Euery man must eate his meat in Godlines. This is indeed to eat vnto the Lord, and it may be done by obseruation of these rules. First, by taking heed of the abuse of any creature appointed for foode, by Intempe∣rance. This abuse holy Iob suspected in his sonnes, while they were a feasting, and there∣fore he sent day by day, and sanctified them, and offered vp burnt offerings vnto God accor∣ding to the number of them all. Iob. 1. 5. Secondly, by receiuing the creatures, as from the hand of God himselfe. For this very end did God, by expresse word, giue vnto A∣dam euery hearth bearing seede, which was vp∣on the earth, and euery tree wherein was the fruit of a tree bearing seed for his meat, that he might receiue it, as God had giuen it vnto him, from his owne hand, Gen. 1. 29. Thus Moses said vnto the Israelites touching
Manna: This is the bread, which the Lord hath giuen you to eate. Exod. 16. 15. This Dauid acknowledged saying, Thou giuest it them, & they gather it, thou openest thy hand and they are filled. Psal. 104. 28. and 145. 15. The Lord vp∣braideth Israel with this fault, by the Pro∣phet Hosea, She did not acknowledge that I gaue her corne, and wine, and oyle, and multiplyed her siluer and gold, Hos. 2. 8. Yea it is noted as an argument of Gods loue to Israel, by the Prophet Ioel, that he sent them corne, wine, and oyle, that they might be satiffied therewith. Ioel. 2. 19. By this dutie, are iustly to be reproo∣ved the carelesse and Godlesse beha∣uiours of sundry persons, who (with the swyne) feed vpon the Creatures of God, but neuer lift vp their eies or hands vnto him, of whome, and from whome they doe receiue them. The verie bruit beast can teach them a better lesson. For (as Dauid saith) The Lyons roaring after their pray, doe seeke their meat from God. Psal. 104. 21. Yea the heauens and the earth, and all that are in them, doe alwaies depend vpon his prouidence; and are alto∣gither guided and directed by him, Iob. 38. And shall not man much more haue an eye vnto his Creator, and wholly depend vpon him, for all blessings, from whom he receiues life and breath and all things. Thirdly, we must receiue these creatures from God our father, as tokens of our reconci∣liation
to him in Christ. So saith Saint Paul, Giuing thankes alwaies, for all things, to God euen the father, in the name of our Lord Iesus Christ. Eph. 5. 20. Thus we hold and receiue Gods blessings, and he that holds and re∣ceiues them otherwise, is an vsurper, and not a right and lawfull possessour of them. Fourthly, we must learne to be content, with that portion that God assigneth to vs, be it neuer so small; and withall labour to see the goodnes of God, euen in the meanest fare that may be. Our table is (as it were) a liuely Sermon to vs, of Gods speciall provi∣dence over our bodies. For first, in reason, dead flesh should rather kill vs, then giue vs nourishment, and yet by his blessing & pro∣vidence, it continueth life and strength. Againe, both we and our meat are but peri∣shing, and therefore when we feede theron, it may serue to stirre vs vp, to seeke for the food of the soule, that nourisheth to life e∣uerlasting. Ioh. 6. 27. Furthermore, looke as euery creature serues for our vse, euen so should we our selues, consecrate our selues vnto God, and serue him both with our soules and bodies, as before hath beene shewed. Sect. 3. The third and last point is, what we are to doe, and how to behaue our selues after our VVhat is re∣quired after out meate. meat? This Moses teacheth the Israelites, Deut. 8. 10. When thou hast eaten and filled thy
self, thou shalt blesse the Lord thy god. This prai∣sing or blessing of god stands in two things. First, in a holy remembrance, that God hath giuen vs our food. For beeing once fil∣led, we must take heed, we forget not God, who hath opened his hand, and plenteously refreshed our bodies with his creatures. Deut. 8. 11. Secondly, we must make conscience, in liew of thankfulnesse to God, to employ the strength of our bodies in seeking his glorie, and walking according to all his lawes and comandements. Whether ye eate or drinke, or whatsoeuer ye doe, doe all to the glorie of God. 1. Cor. 10. 31. We may not liue idlely, & giue our selues to riot and gaming, but labour to serue God and our countrey, in some profitable course of life, least it be said of vs, as it was once of the old Iewes, that we sitte downe to eate and drinke, and rise vp to play. To this I adde one thing further, that when we haue eaten to our contentment, and something remaine, care must be had to re∣serue it, and not to cast it away. For this pur∣pose, we haue the example of Christ, who commandeth to gather vp the broken meate that remaineth, that nothing be lost. Ioh. 6. 12. The reason is, because these reliques and fragments, are part of the creatures; yea they are as well Gods good creatures, as the rest were, and must be preserued to the same vse.
Now if these may not be abused, or lost, much lesse ought the gifts of the minde, which are greater and farre more precious, be suffered to miscarie, but rather to be pre∣serued and increased. A good lesson for such, as haue receiued any speciall gifts of nature, or grace from God; that they mi∣spend them not, or suffer them to perish, but carefully maintaine them to the glorie of God, and the good of others. To conclude this Question, we are all to be exhorted to make conscience of this du∣tie, to vse the good blessings of God in such sort, as they may alwaies tende to the ho∣nour of the giuer, auoiding all excesse and ri∣ot. Reasons to mooue vs hereunto, may be these. I. Excesse destroyes the bodie, and kills euen the very naturall strength and life thereof. II. It brings great hurt to the soule of man, in that it annoyeth the spirits, it dul∣leth the senses, it corrupteth the naturall heate, and good temper of the bodie. Now these things beeing the helpes, and next in∣struments of the soule, if they be once cor∣rupted and decaied, the soule it selfe will at length, be brought to the same passe. III. Let this be considered, that a Woe belongs vnto them, that eate and drinke immode∣rately. Esa. 5. 11. And for this very sinne, the Lord led his owne people into captiui∣tie. v. 13. Yea the drunkard and the glutton,
shall become poore. Prov. 23. 21. And both shall equally, with there pompe and excesse, descend into Hell. Esay. 5. 14. IV. We should be willing to part from all for Christs sake, much more from our excesse; and shall we thinke it possible for a man to forsake all, e∣ven his owne life, that will not forsake ex∣cesse and intemperance, in the vse of Gods creatures? It will be said of some, we are not drun∣ken, though we drinke much. Ans. It is a po∣licie of the Deuill, to delude men withall, when he perswades them, that much drink∣ing is not amisse, if a man be not ouertaken therewith. For it is a sinne to liue and sitte daily by the wine, to be alwaies bibbing and sipping. Wee know not when or where we shall die, and we are commanded to watch ouer our harts, that we be not ouercome with surfetting and drunkennesse. What a madnesse then is it, to giue over our selues to such immoderate excesse; whereby we are vtterly disabled from these, and all other du∣ties of Godlinesse? Sect. 3. In the Third place, we come to those Que∣stions, that concerne the Moderation of our appetite in the vse of Apparell. And of this kind there be two principall Questions; the former of them, beeing nothing else, but an introduction to the latter.
I. Question. Whether ornaments of gold, siluer, precious stones, silkes & veluets, &c. may not lawfully be vsed? Ans. There is a lawfull vse of these things, yet not in all, but onely in themto whome they belong. Reasons of the Answer are these. I. Gold and siluer, &c. are the gifts of God, and serue not onely for necessitie, but for ornament and comelinesse. II. We haue the Examples of sundrie persons in Scripture, which doe warrant the vse of these creatures, and blessings of God. Abrahā by his Steward sends vnto Rebec∣ca a golden abiliment, or earing, of halfe a shekel weight, and two bracelets of tenne shekels weight of gold. Gen. 24. 22. And it is said, that when shee receiued it, she ware the Iewell of gold in her forehead, and the brace∣lets vpon her hands, vers. 47. Ioseph beeing ad∣vanced in Pharaohs Court, had the signet of Pharaoh put vpon his hand, and a chaine of gold about his: necke, and was arayed in fine linnen; all which were the ornamēts of Princes in those countries. Gen. 41. 42. Againe, all the Israe∣lites did were earings of gold, which after∣ward they tooke off from their eares, and
gaue them to Aaron, to make thereof the golden calfe. Exod. 32. 3. And they are not blamed for wearing them, but because they put them to Idolatrous vses. So it is said of king Salomon, that he had siluer in such a∣bundance, that, according to his state, he gaue it in Ierusalem as stones, 2. Cron. 9. 27. And Christ speaketh of the royaltie of Salo∣mon, as of a rare and excellent thing, which himselfe approoued, howsoeuer he preferres the glorie of the Lilies of the field before it, Matt. 6. 29. The daughter of Pharaoh is said to be brought vnto Salomon, in a vesture of gold of Ophir, that is, in a garment of the fi∣nest beaten gold. Psal. 45. 10. All these exam∣ples doe shewe thus much, that there is a lawfull vse of these things in them to whom they appertaine. Against this doctrine, some things are ob∣iected. Obiect. I. In some places of Scripture, wo∣men are forbidden to weare costly apparell and gold. For Paul willeth Timothie, that the women aray themselues in comly attire, not with broidored haire, or gold, or pearles, or costly apparell. 1. Tim. 2. 9. And to the same purpose Peter speaketh. I, Pet. 3. 3. Ans. First; these ornaments, are not by Paul and Peter simply forbidden but the a∣buse of them in riot and excesse. For persons that were in those times called, were of mea∣ner estate; and the Churches in the daies of
the Apostles, cōsisted (for the greater part) of poore, base, and meane men and women. 1. Cor. 1. 28. These things therefore are forbid∣den them, because the vse of golde and pretious ornaments, is nothing els but meere riot, in those that are but of a meane condi∣tion. Secondly I answer, that the Apostles in the places alleadged, doe reprooue a great fault, which was common and ordinarie in those daies. For men and weomen desired, & affected the outward adorning and trim∣ming of their bodies, accounting the out∣ward ornament, which consisted of gold, pearle, and costly apparell, to be the princi∣pall▪ whereas indeede the chiefe ornaments of a Christian, should be the vertues of Mo∣destie and Humilitie, seated in the minde, and restified in the outward carriage. Obiect. II. The Prophet Esay condem∣neth these things in particular. For it seemeth, that he had viewed the wardrobes of the Ladies of the court in Ierusalem, Chap. 3. 18. &c. where he makes a Catalogue of their spe∣ciall attires and ornaments, and pronoun∣ceth the iudgements of God against them all. Ans. Some of the ornaments, which the Prophet there mentioneth, are indeed meere vanities, that were of no moment, and serued to no necessarie or conuenient vse or ende at all. Againe, others of them, were in them∣selues things lawfull, and the Prophet doth
not condemne thē at all, as they haue meete and conuenient vse: but he condemnes them in this regard, because they were made the instruments and signes, of the pride, wanton∣nesse, vanitie, and lightnes of those women. The truth of this answer will appeare, if we consider the 16. v. of that Chapter, where the prophet shews, what his drift was in speaking of those things; not to condemne all orna∣ments, but the pride of the daughters of Ieru∣salem, and their hautines and wantonnesse, testi∣fied by diuers particular behauiours there mentioned. Againe, some of the things there named, were the like, if not of the same kind, with those which Abraham sent to Rebecca, and which shee did weare, Gen. 24. 22. And therefore we may not thinke, that the Pro∣phet intendeth to condemne all things there specified, but onely the abuse of them, as they were then misapplied to wrong endes, and serued to proclaime to the world, the pride and wantonnes of the hearts of that people. II. Question. What is the right, lawfull, and holy vse of apparell. Answ. In the vse of Apparell, two things are to be considered: the Preparation of it, when it is to be worne; & the Wearing, when it is prepared.
§ect. 1. In the right Preparation of our apparell, two Rules are propounded in Scrip∣ture, Preparation of apparell. for our direction. I. Rule. Our care for apparell, and the ornaments of our bodies, must be very mo∣derate. This our Sauiour Christ teacheth at large, Math. 6. from the 28 to the 31 v. Where, commanding men to take no thought for appa∣rell, he forbids not all care, but the curious and immoderate care. The reason is added, because they which walke in their callings, and doe the duties thereof with diligence, shall haue, by Gods blessing, all things need∣full prouided and prepared for them. He that dwells in a borrowed house, will not fall a trimming of it, and suffer his owne hard by, to become ruinous. In like manner, our bo∣die is the house of our soule borrowed of God, and by him lent vnto vs for a time; and we are but his Tenants at-will: for we must depart out of it at his commandement. And therefore our greatest care must be emploi∣ed vpon our soules; and the other which concerneth the adorning of our bodie, must be but moderate. Againe, God in his proui∣dence, clotheth the very hearbs of the field, therefore much more is he carefull for man. And Paul saith, If we haue foode and rament, we must therewith be content, 1. Tim. 6. 8. that is, if we haue foode, and rayment necessarie for vs and ours, we ought to quiet our hearts, and haue no further care for our apparell.
It will be saide, How shall we know what is Necessarie? Answ. A thing is Necessarie two waies: first, in respect of nature, for the preseruation of life and health: secondly, in respect of place, calling, and condition, for the vphol∣ding and maintenance thereof. Now we call that Necessarie rayment, which is necessarie both these waies. For example: That apparell is necessarie for the Scholer, the Tradesman, the Countrey-man, the Gentleman; which serueth not onely to defend their bodies frō cold, but which belongs also to the plāce, degree, calling, and condition of them all. If it be asked, who shall determine and iudge, what is necessarie to these persons and purposes? I answere. Vaine and curious persons are not to be competent iudges hereof; but in these things, we must regard the iudgement and exāple of modest, graue, and frugall persons in euery order and estate; who vpon experience and knowledge, are best able to determine, what is necessarie, and what is not. Againe, though we must not seeke for more then necessarie apparell; yet if God of his goodnes, giue vs abilitie to haue and maintaine more, we must thanke∣fully receiue it, and become good stewards of the same, for the good of men. But some will say; It seemes, that we ought not to keepe abundance, when God giues it, because we may not haue aboue one
coate. For Iohn giues this rule, Luk. 3. 11. Let him that hath two coates, giue to him that hath none. Ans. Iohns meaning must needes be this; He that hath not onely necessarie rayments, but more then necessarie, he must giue of his abundance to them that want. For otherwise, his rule should not agree with Christs own practise, who had himselfe two coates, an inner and an vpper garment, which he kept and wore. Nor with S. Pauls, who had both a cloke and a coate. This Rule, discouers the common sinne∣full practise of many men in the world. The greater sort of men are exceedingly carefull, by all meanes and waies, to follow the fashi∣on, and to take vp euery new fangled attire, whensoeuer it comes abroad. A course flat contrarie to Christs doctrine, which com∣mandeth an honest care onely for necessarie ornaments, and condemneth the contrarie, and that vpon speciall reason; because this inordinate and affected care, is commonly a great picke-purse. It fills mens heades and hearts with vaine and foolish thoughts: it makes them wastfully to abuse the bles∣sings of God giuen vnto them, whereby they are disabled, from helping others that are in neede. Whereas, the first and principall care, ought to be for the adorning of the soule with grace, and putting on the Lord Iesus; and this is it, which will yeeld more comfort to the minde and conscience, then
any externall formalitie to the outward state of man. II. Rule. All apparell must be fitted to the bodie, in a comely and decent manner; such as becommeth holinesse. Tit. 2. 3. If it be here demanded, How we should thus frame and fashion our attire? The an∣swer is, by obseruing the Rules of decencie and comelinesse, which are in number sea∣uen. First, that it be according to the sexe: for men must prepare apparell for men, weomen for weomen. This rule is not Ceremoniall, but grounded vpon the Law of nature, and common honestie. Deut. 22. 5. The woman shall not weare that which pertaineth vnto the man, neither shall a man put on womans raiment: for all that doe so, are abomination to the Lord thy God. Secondly, our apparell must be made ac∣cording to our office; that is, such as may be fit and conuenient for vs, in respect of our calling: that it may not hinder or disable vs, in the performance of the duties thereof. Whereupon comes iustly to be condemned the kinde of apparell, (specially of women) that is vsed in this age. For it makes them like to an image in a frame, set bolt vpright; whereby it comes to passe, that they can not goe well, and with ease or conueniencie, a∣bout any good busines, but must of necessitie either sit, or stand still.
Thirdly, our attire must be according to our abilitie, and maintenance, either in lands or in goods and substance. We must (as the common prouerbe is) shape our coate ac∣cording to our cloath, that so we may not be in want, but haue sufficient wherewith to maintaine our families, and to releeue the poore. Which also serueth to condemne the sinne of many persons, who lay vpon their backes, whatsoeuer they can scrape and ga∣ther together; in the meane while, negle∣cting the honest maintenance of their own e∣states for time to come, and the necessarie releefe of them, that are in distresse and want. Fourthly, it must be answerable to our e∣state and dignitie, for distinction of order and degree in the societies of men. This vse of attire, stands by the very ordinance of God; who, as he hath not sorted all men to al places, so he will haue men to fitte themselues and their attire, to the qualitie of their pro∣per places, to put a difference between them∣selues and others. Thus we read, that Ioseph being by Phaaroh set ouer all the land of Egypt, was arayed with garments of sine linnen, and had a golden chaine put vpon his necke, to put a difference betweene him and the inferiour princes of Pharaoh. Gen. 41. 42. Thus in aun∣cient times, the captaines and cheife of the armies, did weare fine garments of diuers co∣lours of needle worke, to distinguish them
from others. Iud. 5. 30. Thus in Kings courts, they went in soft rayment, and the poorer people in baser and rougher attire. Matt. 11. 8. By which it appeares, that many in these daies do greatly offend. For men keepe not themselues within their owne order: but the Artificer commonly goes clad like the Yeo∣man: the Yeoman like the Gentleman: the Gentleman as the Nobleman: the Noble∣man as the Prince: which bringeth great con∣fusion, and vtterly ouerturneth the order, which God hath set in the states and condi∣ons of men. Fiftly, mens attire is to be framed and pre∣pared, according to the ancient and receiued custome of the countrey, wherein they are brought vp and dwell. Touching this Rule, it is demanded, whe∣ther, if a man see a fashion vsed in other coū∣tries, he may not take it vp here, and vse it? Ans. He may not. For God hath threatned to visite all such, as are cloathed with strange apparell. Zeph. 1. 9. And Paul taxeth it as a great disorder in the Church of Corinth, and euen against nature, that men went in long haire, and women went vncouered. 1. Cor. 11. 13. 14. And if this be so, then what a disorder is that, when men of one country, frame themselues to the fashions and attires, both of men and women of other nations. This one sinne is so common among vs, that it hath branded our English people with the
blacke marke of the vainest and most new∣fangled people vnder heauen. If a stranger comes into our land, he keepes his ancient & customeable attire, without varying or alte∣ration. We on the contrary, cā see no fashion vsed either by the French, Italian, or Spanish, but we take it vp, and vse it as our owne. Sixtly, the garments that we make to co∣uer our bodies, must be such as may expresse the vertues of our mindes; specially the ver∣tues of Modestie, Frugalitie, Shamefastnes. They should be as a booke written with text letters, wherein, at the first, any man may read the graces that be in the hart. Thus Paul exhorteth weomen, that they aray themselues with comely apparell, in shamefastnesse and mode∣sty, not with broidered haire, &c. but as becom∣meth weomen, that professe the feare of God, with good workes. 1. Tim. 2. 9. 10. And our Sauiour commandeth, that the light of our conuer∣sation, euen in outward things, should so shine vnto mē, that they seeing our good works, may glorifie the father which is in heauen. Mat. 5. 16. Seuenthly, it must be framed to the exam∣ple, not of the lighter and vainer sort, but of the grauest, and the most sober of our order and place, both of men & weomen. We haue no expresse rule in Scripture, touching the measure and manner of our apparell: and therefore, the wise and graue presidents of good and godly men, that are of the same, or
like degree with our selues, ought to stand for a rule of direction in this behalfe. To which purpose Paul exhorteth, Whatsoeuer things are pure, honest, of good report, if there be a∣ny vertue, &c. thinke of these things which ye haue both learned and receiued and heard and seene in me, those things doe, Phil. 4. 9. Examples hereof, we haue many in the word of God. Of Iohn the Baptist, who had his garments of Camels haire, Mat. 3. 4. Of Elias, who is said to be a hairie man in respect of his attire, and to be girded (as Iohn was) with a girdle of lea∣ther about his loines. 2. King. 1. 8. For these rough garments, were the principal raiments of Prophets in those times and places, as we read, Zach. 13. 4. And it was the ordinarie fa∣shion of the Iewish nation, to vse goats-hair, not onely for making of their apparel, but e∣uen of the curtaines, that were made for the vse of the sancturie, Exod. 36. 14. If this Rule were practised, it would serue to cut off ma∣ny scandalous behauiours, in the conuersati∣ons of men. For now a daies, men doe striue, who shal goe before another, in the brauest and costliest attire; hauing little or no respect at all, to the examples of godly and sober persons of their degrees and places. And this their excessiue pride and vanitie, is ordi∣narily maintained, by vniust dealing, in lying and deceipt, by couetousnes, and vnmerci∣fulnesse to the poore: sinnes which are so greatly dishonourable vnto God, that the
very earth wherupon men doe liue, can hard∣ly endure the same. Wherfore those that fear God, and haue a care to serue him in holi∣nesse and righteousnesse, ought to hate and detest these courses, renouncing the curious vanity of the world, and testifying the graces and vertues of their minds vnto men, even by their graue and sober gestures and habits of their bodies. §ect. 2. The Second thing to be considered in the VVearing of apparell. right vse of apparell, is the wearing and putting of it on. Touching which, two speciall Rules are to be obserued. I. Rule. That we weare and put on our apparell, for those proper Ends, for which God hath ordained the same. The Ends of apparell, are specially these. First, for Necessitie sake; that is, for the de∣fending of the body from the extremitie of parching heate, and the pinching cold, and consequently the preseruing of life & health. This was the end, for which garments were first made after the fall. And the reason of it is this. Whilest man was yet in the state of Innocencie, before his fall, ther was a perfect temperature of the aire, in respect of mans bodie, and so there was no need of garments; and nakednesse then was no shame vnto man, but a glorious comelines. Now after that A∣dam and in him al mankind, had sinned, vani∣tie came vpon all the creatures; & amongst
the rest, vpon the aire a maruelous distempe∣rature in respect of heat and cold. For the re∣medie whereof, it was ordained that Adam should weare apparell, which God hauing once made and appointed, he hath euer since blessed it as his owne ordinance, as daily ex∣perience sheweth. For, our attire which is void of heat and life, doth notwithstanding preserue mans bodie in heat and life; which it could not doe, if there were not a speciall prouidence of God attending vpon it. The Second Ende of apparell, is Honestie. For to this ende doe we put it on, and weare it, for the couering and hiding of that defor∣mitie of our naked bodies, which immedi∣ately followed vpon the transgression of our first parents: and in this respect also, were garments (after the fall) appointed by God, for the vse of man. It is obiected, that Esay prophecied na∣ked and bare-foot, Esa. 20. . and so did Saul, 1. Sam. 19. 24. I answer: first, that which the Prophet did, was done by commandement, as may appeare in the second verse of that Chapter. For the Lord gaue him comman∣dement so to doe. Againe, he is saide to be naked, because he put off his vpper, ent, which was sackcloath, or some other rough garment, that Prophets vsed to wenre; but it cannot be prooued, that he put off that garment which was next his flesh and skinne.
Concerning Saul, there be two answers giuen. One, that he put off his vpper gar∣ment, as Esay did. For we are not to imagine, that he prophecied naked, it beeing so vn∣seemely a thing, and euen against the Law of nature since the fall. The other answer, and that according to the true meaning of the text is; that Saul, before the Spirit of prophecie came vpon him, had put on and wore his warrelike attire, wherewith he went out to take Dauid. But when the Spi∣rit came vpon him, then he put off his mili∣tarie habite, and went in other attire, after the manner and fashion of a Prophet, and so prophecied. And therefore, whereas he is saide to goe naked, the meaning is, that he stript himselfe of his armour, which both himselfe and his messengers vsed, in pursu∣ing after Dauid. Now touching the Couering of the bodie with apparell, these things are to be remem∣bred. First, that it must be couered in de∣cent, and seemely sort. Thus Ioseph wrap∣ped Christs bodie that was dead, in a cleane linnen cloath, together with the spices, Matt. 27. 59. Secondly, the whole bodie must be co∣uered some onely parts excepted, which (for necessitie sake) are left open and bare, as the hands and face: because there is an ignomi∣nious shame, not only on some parts, but ouer the whole bodie. And here comes to be re∣proued, the affected nakednesse vsed of sun∣dry
persons, who are wont to haue their gar∣ments made of such a fashion, as that their neck and brests may be left for a great part vncouered. A practise full of vanitie, and cleane contrary to this Rule grounded in cor∣rupted nature. For if the whole body be ouer spread with shame, by sinne, why should a∣ny man by such practise, (as much as in him lies) vncouer his shame to the view of the world? The ende of attire is, to hide the shamefull nakednes of the bodie, from the sight of men. But such persons as these are, doe hereby expresse the vanitie and lightnes of their mindes, by leauing some parts of their bodies open and vncouered. Wherein, what doe they else, but euen display and manifest vnto men and Angels, their owne shame and ignominie? Nay, what doe they else, but glorie in that, which is (by the iust iudgement of God) reprochfull vnto them? Let all those that feare God, and are hum∣bled in the consideration of their sinnes, which are the matter of the shame of man∣kinde, be otherwise affected. A Third Ende of apparell is, the honouring of the bodie. To this purpose S. Paul saith, 1. Cor. 12. 23. Vpon those members of the bodie, which we think most vnhonest, put  on the grea∣ter honour, &c. v. 24. God hath tempered the bo∣die together, and giuen the more honour to that part which lacked. And in 1. Thess. 4. 4. It is the will of God, &c. that euery one of you should know
how to possesse his vessell in holinesse and honour. These words are spoken of chastitie, but they are generally to be vnderstood of any other vertue belonging to the bodie. Now the rea∣son of this ende is plaine. For the bodie of e∣uery beleeuer, is the Temple of the Holy Ghost, and a member of Christ, in the kinde and place, as well as the soule. Therefore it ought to be both holily and honourably v∣sed. For the honouring of the bodie with out∣ward ornaments, we must remember this di∣stinction. Some ornaments are inward, and some are borrowed. Inward, are the graces and gifts of God; these are our owne. Bor∣rowed, are gold, siluer, pearles, and pretious stones: and these are outward. And of the two, more speciall care ought to be had of the inward, then of the outward and bor∣rowed. For these are indeede faire and ho∣nourable, in the opinion and estimation of men, but the other are farre more honoura∣ble in the sight of God. And therefore Saint Peter exhorteth weomen, that their apparell be not outward, as with broidered haire, and gold set about, or in sumptuous garments, but that the hidden man of the heart be vncorrupt, with a meeke and quiet spirit, which is before God a thing pretious. 1. Pet. 3. 3, 4. Now that we may vse our apparell, to the Endes before rehearsed, we are yet further to obserue some speciall Rules, which may
serue for our direction in the right adorning of the bodie. First, euery one must be content with their owne naturall fauour, and complexion, that God hath giuen them; and account of it, as a pretious thing, be it better or be it worse. For the outward forme and fauour that man hath, is the worke of God himselfe, fitted and proportioned vnto him, in his concep∣tion, by his speciall prouidence. Beeing then the Lords owne worke, and his wil, thus to frame it rather then otherwise, great reason there is, that man should rest contented with the same. Here comes to be iustly reprooued, the straunge practise and behauiour of some in these daies, who beeing not contented with that forme and fashion, which God hath sor∣ted vnto them, doe deuise artificiall formes and fauours, to set vpon their bodies and fa∣ces, by painting and colouring; thereby ma∣king themselues seeme that which indeede they are not. This practise is most abomina∣ble in the very light of nature, and much more by the light of Gods word; wherein we haue but one onely example thereof, and that is of wicked Iesabel, 2. king. 9. 30. who is noted by this marke of a notorious harlot, that shee painted her face. For what is this, but to finde fault with Gods owne workeman∣ship? and to seeke to correct the same, by a counterfait worke of our owne deuising;
which cannot but be highly displeasing vn∣to him. A cunning Painter, when he hath once fi∣nished his worke, if any man shall goe about to correct the same, he is greatly offended. Much more then may God, the most wise and absolute former, and Creatour of his workes, be highly offended with all those, that cannot content themselues, with the fa∣uour and feature they haue receiued from him, but will needes be calling his worke in∣to question, and refining it according to their owne humours and fancies. Tertullian in his booke de habitu mulierū, calls such per∣sons, and that deseruedly, the Deuills hand∣maides. But may some say, if there be any defor∣mitie in the bodie, may we not labour to couer it? Ans. Yes: but we may not set any new forme on the face, or habite on the bo∣die. Dissembling is condemned, as well in deede, as in word, and such is this. Secondly, we must place the principall or∣nament of our soules and bodies, in vertue and good workes, and not in any outward things. So would Paul haue woomen to a∣ray thēselues in comely apparell, with shame∣fastnes and modestie, 1. Tim. 2. 9. Thirdly, in vsing of ornaments before∣named, we must be very sparing, and keepe our selues within the meane. Gen. 24. 22. A∣brahams seruant gaue Rebecca an abille∣ment
of halfe a shekel weight, and two bracelets of ten shekels of gold, which shee put vpon her forehead and hands, v. 47. all which were of no great value, and therefore not excessiue, but comely and moderate. And in the Old Testament, kings daughters were clad but in parti-coloured garments. 2. Sam. 13. 18. There was therefore, euen a∣mongst them, great plainenesse. It will here be demanded, What is then the measure that must be vsed? Ans. The Scripture giues no rule for our direction in this point, but the example and iudgement of the sagest and soberest persons in euery order, age, and condition; and as they doe and iudge, so must we. As for example: whe∣ther a man should weare a ruffe single, or double, or tripled, &c. the Scripture, in parti∣cular, giues no direction: onely we must looke vpon the example of the soberest, and discreetest persons of our order and age, and that ought to be our president for imita∣tion. Fourthly, ornaments must be vsed not al∣waies alike, but according to times and sea∣sons. It is noted as a fault in the rich glut∣ton, that he went euery day in costly apparell. Luk. 16. 19. In the daies of reioycing, we may put on more outward ornaments: and so they vsed of ancient times, at mariages, to put on wedding garments. Matth. 22. But in the daies of mourning, baser and courser at∣tire
is to be vsed, as fittest for the time. Fiftly, we must adorne our bodies to a right ende; to wit, that thereby we may ho∣nour them, and in them honour God. A∣gainst this Rule do offend those, that adorne their bodies, to be praised, to be counted rich and great persons, and to purchase and procure vnto themselues the loue of straun∣gers. This is the harlots practise, described by Salomon at large, Prou. 6. 25. & 7. 10. 16. These are the Endes, for which we must at∣tire our selues. And so much of the first maine Rule to be obserued, in the wearing and putting on of apparell. The Second maine Rule followeth. We must make a spirituall vse of the apparell which we weare. How may that be done? Ans. First, we must take occasion thereby to humble our selues, and that in this man∣ner. When we see the plaister vpon the sore, we know there is a wound: and so, the couer of our bodies, must put vs in minde of our shame and nakednes, in regard of grace and Gods fauour, by reason of originall sinne. And we are to know, that it is a dangerous practise for any man, to puffe vp himselfe in pride, vpon the sight and vse of his apparell. For this is to be proud of his owne shame. Nay, it is as much, as if a theese should be proud of his bolts, and of the halter about his necke, garments beeing nothing els but
the couer of our shame, and the signes of our sinnes. Secondly, by the putting on of our gar∣ments, we must be admonished to put on Christ. Rom. 13. 14. Quest. How shall wee doe that? Ans. Thus: We must conceiue Christs obedience actiue and passiue, as a couering; and therefore by praier we are to come vnto God in his name, and intreat him to accept this his obedience for vs: yea that Christ may be made vnto vs wisdome, righteousnes, sanctification, and redemption. And we on the other side, made conforma∣ble to him in life and death, in all morall du∣ties. Lastly, that we may haue the same mind, affection, and conuersation that he had. Thirdly, when we put off our clothes, we then are admonished of putting off the olde man; that is, the masse and body of sinnefull corruption. And we then put him off, when we can by grace hate sinne, and carrie a reso∣lute purpose in our hearts of not sinning. Fourthly, when we cloth our selues, and trusse our attire to our bodies; this should, teach vs a further thing, that it behooueth vs, to gird vp our loines, to haue our lightes bur∣ning, to prepare our selues to meete Christ, whether by death, or by the last iudgment. If we make not these vses of our attire, we doe not rightly vse, but rather abuse the same. In a word, to shut vp this point; we are all to be exhorted to make conscience of the
practise of these Rules, and to take heede of pride in these outward things. And in way of motiue hereunto; consider first, how great & hainous a sinne Pride is. The greatnes of it may be discerned by foure things. First, in it, and the fruit thereof, superfluity of apparell, there is an abuse of our wealth, to needlesse and superfluous vses, which ought to be employed to vses more necessa∣rie; as to the good of the Church, common wealth and familie, and especially for the re∣leife of the poore. Secondly, in this sinne there is an abuse of time. For they that giue themselues to pride; spend so much time in the adorning of their bodies, that they haue no leisure for the a∣dorning and beautifying of the soule. Hence it comes to passe, that proud persons abound with ignorance, idlenesse, wantonnesse, and many other enormities. Thirdly, in this sinne there is an abuse of the attire it selfe: in that it is made a signe of the vanitie of the mind, and wantonnesse of the heart, which should be the signe of a heart religiously disposed. Fourthly, in it there is a confusion of order in the estates & societies of men. For where∣as one order of men should goe thus attired, and another after another manner; by this it comes to passe, that equall and superior are clothed both alike, and that which should be an occasion to humble vs, is made an occasi∣on
to puffe vs vp. Fiftly, there is a great iudgement threat∣ned against this sinne. Esay. 2. 11. 12. Zeph. 3. 11. The greatnes of this vice, we are to endea∣vour, by all means possible, to redresse in our selues. For which purpose, we must be careful to see and feele, and withall to bewaile the spirituall nakednes of our soules; which is a deprauation of the image of God, wherein we are created, according to him, in holines and righteousnesse, the want whereof makes vs vgly and deformed in the eyes of God. And the true sense and experience of this, will turne our mindes and thoughts from the trimming of the body, and make vs e∣specially to labour for the righteousnesse of Christ imputed, as the onely couering which will keepe vs warme & safe from the stormes and tempests of the wrath and furie of God. Sect. 4. In the fourth place, we come to the hand∣ling of those Questions, that concerne the Moderation of our Appetite in the Vse of Pleasures and Recreations. And these are spe∣cially three. I. Question. Whether Recreation be lawfull for a Christian man?
Ans. Yea, and that for two causes. First, Rest from labour, with the refreshing of bodie and mind, is necessarie; because mans nature is like the bow, which being al∣way bent and vsed, is soone broken in pie∣ces. Now that which is necessarie, is lawfull. And if rest be lawfull, then is recreation also lawfull. Secondly, by Christian libertie, we are al∣lowed to vse the creatures of God, not onely for our necessitie, but also for meete and convenient delight. This is a confes∣sed truth; and therefore to them, which shall condemne fit and conuenient recreati∣on (as some of the ancient Fathers haue done, by name Chrysostome and Ambrose) it may be said, be not to righteous, be not to wise. Eccl. 7. 18. II. Question. What kindes of recreati∣ons and sports, are lawfull & conuenient, and what be vn∣lawfull and vnconuenient? Ans. I will first lay downe this ground, that, All lawfull Recreation is onely in the vse of things indifferent, which are in them∣selues neither commanded nor forbidden. For by christiā libertie, the vse of such things for lawfull delight and pleasure, is permitted
vnto vs. Therfore meete and fitt recreations doe stand in the vse of things indifferent, and not in things either commanded or forbid∣den. Hence I deriue three Conclusions, that may serue for the better answer of the Que∣stion. I. Recreation may not be in the vse of holy things; that is, in the vse of the word, Sacra∣ments, praier, or in any act of religion. For these things are sacred & divine, they doe stād by Gods expresse cōmandement, & may not be applyed to any common or vulgar vse. For this cause it is well provided, that the pageants which haue beene vsed in sundrie cities of this land are put downe; because they were nothing els, but either the whole or part of the historie of the Bible turned in∣to a Play. And therefore the lesse to be al∣lowed, considering that the more holy the matter is which they represent, the more vn∣holy are the plaies themselues. Againe, all such iests, as are framed out of the Phrases & sentences of the scripture, are abuses of holy things, and therefore carefully to be avoi∣ded. The common saying may teach vs thus much. Non est bo∣num ludere cum Sanctis. It is no safe course to play with holy things. Lastly, vpon the former conclusion, we are taught that it is not meete, conuenient, or laudable for men to mooue occasion of laughter in Sermons. The second Cōclusion. Recreation may not be made of the sinns or offences of men. They ought
to be vnto vs the matter of sorrow & mour∣ning. Dauid shed riuers of tears, because men brake the commandements of God, Psal. 119. 136. The righteous heart of Lot was vexed, with hearing the abominations of Sodome. 2. Pet. 2. 8. Vpon this, it followeth first, that common plaies, which are in vse in the world, are to be reprooued, as beeing not meet and conueni∣ent matter of Recreation. For they are no∣thing els, but representations of the vices & misdemeanous of men in the world. Now such representations are not to be approo∣ved. Paul saith, Fornication, couetousnes, let them not be named among you, as becommeth Saintes, Eph. 5. 3. And if vices of men may not be na∣med, vnlesse the naming of them, tend to the reproouing & further condemning of them, much lesse may they be represented, for the causing of mirth and pastime. For, naming is farre lesse, then representing, which is the re∣all acting of the vice. Indeed Magistrates & Ministers may name them, but their naming must be to punish, and reforme them, not otherwise. Againe, it is vnseemely, that a man should put on the person, behauiour, and ha∣bite of a woman; as it is also for a woman to put on the person, behauiour and habite of a man, though it be but for an houre. The law of God forbiddes both, Deut. 22. 3. And that law, for equitie, is not meerely iudiciall, but morall. Nay, it is the law of nature and
common honesty. Here also, the dauncing vsed in these daies is to be reprooued; namely, the mixed dauncing of men and weomen, in number & measure, (specially after solemne feasts) with many lascivious gestures accompany∣ing the same; which cannot, nor ought to be iustified, but condemned. For it is no better, then the very bellowes of lust and vn∣cleanes, yea the cause of much euill. It is con∣demned in the daughter of Herodias, daun∣cing before Herod. Mark. 6. 22. And in the Israelites, that sat downe to eat and drinke, and rose vp to play, that is, to daunce. We read indeed, of a kind of dauncing commended in Scripture, that Moses Aaron and Miriam vsed at the redde sea, Exod. 15. 20. And Da∣vid before the Arke, 1. Sam. 18. And the daughters of Israel, when Dauid gotte the victorie of Goliah, 2. Sam. 6. 14. But this dauncing was of another kind. For it was not mixt, but single, men together, and women apart by themselues. They vsed not in their dauncing wanton gestures, and amorous songs, but the Psalmes of praise and thanks∣giuing. The cause of their dauncing was spi∣rituall ioy, and the end of it was praise and thanksgiuing. It may be alleadged, that Ecclesiastes saith, There is a time of mourning, and a time of dauncing, Eccl. 3. And Dauid saith, Thou hast turned my ioy into dauncing, Psal. 30. 1. And
the Lord saith in Ieremie, O daughter Sion, thou shalt got forth with the daunce of them that reioyce. Ier. 31. 4. I answer: first, these places speake of the sacred dauncing before na∣med, and not of the dauncing of our times. Secondly, I say, that these places speake not of dauncing properly, but of reioycing sig∣nified by dauncing: that is to say, a heartie reioycing, or merrie-making. Besides that, the Prophet Ieremie speaks by way of com∣parison, as if he should say, Then shall the Virgin reioyce, as men are woont to doe in the duin. And it is sometimes the vse of the Scripture, to expresse things lawfull by a comparison, drawne from things vnlawfull: as in the Parables of the vnrighteous Iudge, the vniust Steward, and the theefe in the night. The third Conclusion. We may not make recreations of Gods iudgements, or of the punish∣ments of sinne. The Law of God forbiddes vs to lay a stumbling blocke before the blind, to cause him to fall, though it be not done in earnest, but in sport, Leuit. 19. 14. Vpon the same ground, we are not to sport our selues with the follie of the naturall foole. For that is the blindnes of his minde, and the iudgement of God vpon him. I know it hath beene the vse of great men, to keepe fooles in their hou∣ses: And I dare not condemne the fact. For they may doe it, to set before their cies a daily spectacle of Gods iudgement, and to
consider how God in like sort, might haue dealt with them. And this vse is Christian. Neuerthelesse, to place a speciall recreation, in the follie of such persons, and to keepe them onely for this ende, it is not laudable. When Dauid fained himselfe to be madde, before Achish the King of Gath, marke what the Heathen King could say, Haue I neede of madde men, that ye haue brought this fellow, to play the madde man in my presence? Shall he come into my house? 1. Sam. 21. 15. Againe, the Bayting of the Beare, and Cockefights, are no meete recreations. The baiting of the Bull hath his vse, and therefore it is commanded by ciuill authoritie; and so haue not these. And the Antipathie and cru∣eltie, which one beast sheweth to another, is the fruit of our rebellion against God, and should rather mooue vs to mourne, then to reioyce. The Second answer to the former Questi∣on, is this. Games may be deuided into three sorts. Games of wit or industry, games of hazard, and a mixture of both. Games of wit, or industrie are such, as are ordered by the skil and industry of man. Of this sort are Shooting in the long bow, Shoo∣ting in the caleeuer, Running, Wrastling, Fensing, Musicke, the games of Chests, and draughts, the Philosophers game, and such like. These, and all of this kind, wherein the
industry of the mind & body hath the chie∣fest stroke, are very commendable, and not to be disliked. Games of hazard are those, in which ha∣zard onely beares the sway, and orders the game, and not witte; wherein also there is (as we say) chance, yea meere chance in re∣gard of vs. Of this kind is Dicing, and sundry games at the Tables & Cardes. Now games that are of meere-hazard, by the consent of godly Divines, are vnlawfull. The reasons are these. First, games of meere hazard are indeede los; and the vse of a lot, is an act of religiō, in which we referre vnto God, the determinati∣on of things of moment, that can no other way be determined. For in the vse of a lotte there be foure things. The first is, a casuall act done by vs, as the casting of the Die. The se∣cond is, the applying of this acte, to the de∣termination of some particular controversie, the ending whereof maintaines peace, order, and loue among men. The third is confession, that God is a soueraigne iudge, to end and determine things, that can no other way be determined. The fourth is, supplication, that Go would, by the disposition of the lotte, when it is cast, determine the euent. All these actions are infolded in the vse of a lotte, and they are expressed, Act. 1. ver. 24. 25. 26. Now then, seeing the vse of a lotte is a solemne act of religiō, it may not be applied to sporting,
as I haue shewed in the first conclusion. Se∣condly, such games are not recreations, but rather matter of stirring vp troblesome pas∣sions, as feare, sorrow, &c. and so they di∣stemper the body and mind. Thirdly, cove∣tousnes is commonly the ground of them all. Wherevpon it is, that men vsually play for mony. And for these causes, such plaies by the consent of learned Divines, are vnlaw∣full. The third kind of plaies are mixt, which stand partly of hazard, and partly of witte, & in which hazard beginnes the game, and skil gets the victorie: and that which is defectiue by reason of hazard, is corrected by witte. To this kind, are referred some games at the cards and tables. Now the common opi∣nion of learned Divines is, that as they are not to be cōmended, so they are not simply to be condemned, and if they be vsed, they must be vsed very sparingly. Yet there be o∣thers, that hold these mixt games to be vn∣lawfull, and iudge the very dealing of the cards to be a lotte, because it is a meere ca∣suall action. But, as I take it, the bare dealing of the cards is no more a lotte, then the dea∣ling of an almes, when the Princes Almner puts his hand into his pocket, and giues, for example, to one man sixe pence, to another twelue pence, to another two pence, what comes forth without any choice. Now this casuall distribution is not a lot, but onely a
casuall action. And in a lot, there must be two things. The first is, a casuall act: the se∣cond, the applying of the foresaid act, to the determination of some particular and vn∣certaine euent. Now the dealing of the cards is a casuall act; but the determination of the vncertaine victorie, is not from the dealing of the cardes, in mixed games, but from the wit and skill, at least from the will of the players. But in things that are of the nature of a lot, the wit and will of man hath no stroke at all. Neuerthelesse, though the dea∣ling of the cardes, and mixed games, be no lots; yet it is farre saffer and better, to ab∣staine from them, then to vse them: and where they are abolished, they are not to be restored againe, because in common experi∣ence, many abuses and inconueniences at∣tend vpon them: and things vnnecessarie, when they are much abused, because they are abused, they must not be vsed, but rather remooued, as the brasen serpent was, 2. king. 18. 4. III. Question. How are we to vse recrea∣tions? For answer whereof, we must remember these foure speciall rules. I. Rule. We are to make choice of Re∣creations, that are of least offence, and of the
best report. Phil. 4. 8. Whatsoeuer things are of good report, thinke of them. The reason is, be∣cause in all recreations, we must take heede of occasions of sinne, both in our selues and others. And this mooued Iob, while his sonnes were a feasting, to offer daily burnt offerings, according to the number of them all, because he thought, it may be, my sonnes haue sinned, and blasphemed God in their hearts. Iob 1. 5. And not onely that, but I adde fur∣ther, we must take heede of occasions of of∣fence in others. Vpon this ground, Paul saies, that rather then his eating should offend his bro∣ther, he would eate no meate while the world in∣dured. 1. Cor. 8. 13. In this regard, it were to be wished, that games of wit should be vsed onely, and not games of hazard, because they are more scandalous then the other. Lastly, in things that are lawfull in them∣selues, we are to remember Paules rule, All things are Lawfull, but all things are not expedi∣ent. 1. Cor. 6. 12. II. Rule. Our Recreations must be pro∣fitable to our selues, and others; and they must tend also to the glorie of God. Our Sauiour Christ saies, that of euery idle word that men shall speake, they shall giue an account at the day of iudgement. Matth. 12. 36. Where by idle words, he meaneth such, as bring no profit to men, nor honour to God. And if for idle words, then also for idle recreations, must we be accountable to him. Againe, S.
Paul teacheth, that whether we eate or drinke, or whatsoeuer we doe, we must doe all to the glorie of God . Cor. 10. 31. Therefore the scope and ende of all recreations is, that God may be honoured in and by them. III. Rule. The ende of our Recreation must be, to refresh our bodies and mindes. It is then an abuse of recreation, when it is v∣sed to winne other mens money. The gaine that comes that way, is worse then vsurie, yea, it is flat theft. For by the law, we may re∣couer things stolne, but there is no law to recouer things wonne. And yet, if play be for a small matter, the losse whereof is no hurt to him that looseth it, and if it be appli∣ed to a common good, it is lawfull, other∣wise not. IV. Rule. Recreation must be mode∣rate and sparing, euen as the vse of meat and drinke, and rest. Whence it followeth, that they which spende their whole life in ga∣ming, as Players doe, haue much to answer for. And the like is to be saide of them that haue lands and possessions, and spend their time in pleasures and sports, as is the fashion of many gentlemen in these daies. Now Recreation must be sparing, two waies. First, in regard of time. For we must re∣deeme the time, that is, take time while time lasteth, for the procuring of life euerlasting. Eph. 5. 16. This condemneth the wicked pra∣ctise
of many men, that follow this game and that, to driue away time, wheras they should employ all the time that they can, to doe Gods will. And indeede, it is all to little, to doe that which we are commanded: and therfore while it is called to day, let vs make all the hast we can, to repent and be reconci∣led vnto God. Secondly, Recreation must be sparing, in regard of our affection. For we may not set our hearts vpon sports, but our affection must be tempered and alaied with the feare of God. Thus Salomon saies, that laughter is madnes, Eccles. 2. 2. so farre-forth, as it hath not the feare and reuerence of the name of God to restraine it. This was the sinne of the Iewes reprooued by the Prophet, that they gaue themselues to all manner of pleasure, and did not consider the worke of the Lord: that is, his iudgements and corrections. Esa. 5. 12. And thus if Sports and Recreations be not ordered, and guided according to this and the other Rules, we shall make them all not onely vnprofitable vnto vs, but vtterly vn∣lawfull. And so much of the vertue of Tem∣perance.
CHAP. V. Of Liberalitie. HItherto we haue treated of the first sort of Vertues, that are seated in the will, which doe respect a mans owne selfe, namely of Cle∣mencie, which standeth in the moderation of the mind in respect of anger: and Temperance, which consisteth in the moderation of our appetite, in respect of riches, apparell, meate and drinke, pleasures and recreations. Now we come to the second sort, which respect others beside our seles. And these belong to the practise either of Courtesie and kindnes, or Equitie and right. Of the first kind, is Liberalltie: of the second is Iu∣stice, in shewing or giuing Equitie, or Forti∣tude in maintaining the same. Of these in order. Liberalitie, is a vertue, seated in the will, whereby we shew or practise courtesie and kindnes to others. The principall Questions touching this Vertue, may be referred to that text of Scripture which is written Luk. 11. 41. Therefore giue almes of those things which ye haue, and behold all things shall be
cleane vnto you. The words are a rule or Counsell, deliue∣red by Christ to the Pharisies: and the true and proper sense of them, is this. You Phari∣sies, giue your selues to the practise of iniu∣stice and oppression, and thereby you desile your selues, and all your actions. For redresse hereof, I propound you this Rule; Practise Charitie in giuing of your almes, let your outward good actions, proceede from the inward syncere affection of your hearts to∣wards your brethren; and then shall you at∣taine to a holy and pure vse of your goods. The counsell of Daniel to King Nebuchad∣nezar, Dan. 4. 24. to breake off his sinnes by the practise of iustice, and his iniquities by mercie to the afflicted, may be a good Commentarie to this Text. In the words, I consider two things. A re∣medie, Therefore giue almes of those things you haue: and the fruit that followes vpon the remedie, and behold all things shall be cleane vnto you. Sect. 1. The Remedie, is the vertue of Christian Liberalitie, consisting principally in the pra∣ctise of Loue and mercie, in giuing of Almes. For the better vnderstanding whereof, fiue Questions are briefly to be propounded and resolued.
I. Question. Who, or what persons must giue Almes? Ans. There be two sorts of men, that are, and ought to be, giuers of Almes. The first sort are Rich men, who besides things necessarie, haue superfltle and abun∣dance, yea, much more then things necessa∣rie. These are such as haue the worlds good, as S. Iohn saith, whereby they are inabled, to . Ioh. 3. 17. giue and bestow releefe vpon others, out of their abundance. Thus Saint Paul saith, that the abundance of the Corinthians, must supplie the want of other Churches, 2. Cor. 8. 14. Many other proofes might be brought, but these are sufficient in a knowne and confessed truth. A second sort of giuers, are men of the poore sort, that haue but things necessarie, and sometime want them too. And because this point is not so easily graunted, therefore I will prooue it by the Scriptures. The man that liues by his work, is commā∣ded to labour in his calling, that he may haue something to giue to them that want, ∣ph. 4. 28. The poore widow that cast into the Lords treasurie of her penurie, but two mites, that is the eight part of a pennie, is commen∣ded; and Christ preserreth her almes, before the great gifts of the richer sort, luk. 21. 2. The
Church of Macedonia, beeing poore and in extreame necessitie, doth yet send reliefe to other Churches, and is commended for it by Paul. 2. Cor. 8. 2. Their povertie excused them not frō liberalitie, but they were liberall, not onely according to, but even beyond their a∣bilitie. Our Sauiour Christ himselfe liued of almes: for Ioanna the wife of Chuza Herods steward, & Susāna ministred vnto him of their substance, Luk. 8. 3. Where by the way, we note, that he did not liue by begging, as the Papists affirme, but by the voluntarie mini∣stration and contribution of some, to whom he preached. Now, though he was so poore himselfe, yet he vsed to giue aimes of that he had, Ioh. 13. 29. The oblations of the Old Testament, for the maintenance of the Altar, were a matter of great cost and charge, in sa∣crifices, & such like ceremonies: & yet al were charged with them, the poore, as well as the rich. Now in the new Testament, the materi∣all Altar is taken away, & yet we haue some∣thing in the roome therof, namely, those that are poore and destitute, which all men are bound in conscience to releeue and main∣taine, as once they were to maintaine the Al∣tar. Saint Iohn commends vnto vs Charitie, not that which consisteth in words onely, but which shewes it selfe in actions, 1. Ioh. 3. 18. teaching that the one is no way sufficient without the other. Lastly, all mankind is di∣stinguished into these two sorts: some are gi∣vers,
some are receiuers of aimes: there is not a third kind to be found in the Scriptures. Yet here an exception must be added, that this doctrine be not mistakē. There are some persons exempted from this dutie, & they be such, as are in subiection to others, and are not at their owne disposition. Of this sort, are children vnder the gouernement of their pa∣rents, and seruants subiect to the authoritie and dominion of their Masters. For the goods which they haue, are not their owne, neither may they dispose of them as they list: they therefore must not be giuers. It may be asked, whether the wife may giue almes without the consent of her hus∣band, considering that she is in subiection to another, and therfore all that she hath is ano∣thers, & not her own. Ans. The wife may giue almes of some things, but with these cautiōs; as first she may giue of those ex parapher∣nalibus. goods that she hath excepted from marriage. Secondly, she may giue of those things which are commō to them both, provided it be with her hus∣bands consent, at least generall and impli∣cite. Thirdly, she may not giue without or against the consent of her husband. And the reason is, because both the law of nature, and the word of God, commands her obedience to her husband in all things. If it be alleadged, that Ioanna the wife of Chuza Herodes steward, with others, did mi∣nister to Christ of their goods, Luk. 8. 3. I an∣swer.
It is to be presumed, that it was not done without all consent. Againe, if it be said, that Abigail brought a present to Dauid, for the releife of him and his young men, whereof she made not Nabal her husband acquainted, 1. Sam. 25. 19. I an∣swer, it is true, but marke the reason. Nabal was generally of a churlish and vnmercifull disposition, wherevpon he was altogether vnwilling, to yeeld releife to any, in howe great necessitie soeuer; whence it was, that he ailed on the young men, that came to him, and droe them away, ver. 14. Againe, he was a foolish man; and giuen to drunken∣nesse, so as he was not fitte to gouerne his house, or to dispense his almes. Besides that, Abigail was a woman of great wisedome, in all her actions, and that which she now did was to saue Nabals and her owne life, yea the liues of his whole family: for the case was desperate, and all that they had, were in present hazard. That example therefore, is no warrant for any woman to giue almes, vnlesse it be in the like case. II. Question. To whome must almes be giuen? Ans. To them that are in neede Eph. 4. 28. For the better conceiving of this answer, we must remember, that there be three degrees
of need. The first is extreame necessitie, when a man is vtterly destitute of the meanes of preseruation of life. The second is great need, when a man hath very little to maintaine himselfe, and his. The third is common neces∣sitie, when he hath something, but yet not sufficient or competent. Now those that are in the first and second degree of neede, they are the persons that must be scoured and releeued. For proofe hereof consider these places, Mat. 25. 35. 36. I was hungry, and ye gaue me meat, I thirsted, & ye gaue m drinke, I was naked, and ye clothed mee, I was sicke, and ye visited me, I was in prison, and ye came unto me. Where obserue what person Christ commendeth vnto vs to be re∣leeued, the hungry, thirstie, naked, sicke, har∣bourles, and the captue or prisoner. Rom. 12. 20. If thine enemie hunger, feede him; if the thirst, giue him drinke. We must not onely sup∣ply the need of our freindes, but also our e∣nemies. . Tim. 5. 16. If any beleeuing man or wo∣man haue widowes, let him minister vnto them, &c. that there may be sufficient for them that are widowes indeede. Here widowes that are de∣solate, without friends and goods, are com∣mended to the liberalitie of the Church. Le∣uit. 25. 35. If thy brother be impouerished, and hath the trembling hand, thou shalt releeue him, as a stranger or soiourner, so shall he liue with thee. By the trembling hand, is meant the man that workes hard for his liuing, and yet can∣not
by his labour get things necessarie, but must needes stretch out his hand, to others that are in better state for helpe. Here two Questions may further be made. First, whether we must giue almes to beg∣gers? I meane such as goe from doore to doore: for they come vnder the degrees of needie persons. Ans. Beggars are of two sorts: either such as are strong, able to labour, and doe some∣what for their liuing; or such as are weake and impotent, vnable to take paines for the maintenance of themselues, or those that belong vnto them. The first sort, are not to be reiceued. For touching them, the Apostle hath giuen this rule, He that will not labour, must not eate, 2. Thess. 3. 10. 12. Euery man must liue by the labour of his owne hands, and feede vpon his owne bread. Againe, such beggers are theeues & robbers, because they steale their labour from the Church and Common∣wealth, which is as profitable, as land and treasure. In the old Law, if two men striued together, and the one had wounded the o∣ther; the offender was inioyned, not onely to pay for the healing, but for the losse of his time also. Exod. 21. 19. And in like man∣ner, ought such persons to beare the punish∣ment, both of their theft, and of the losse of their labour. And the truth is, they that giue to them in this their loose life, doe main∣taine
them in wickednes. Yet here one Caution is to be remembred: that, if such a man be in extreame neede, he must be helped, rather then he should perish. And the Magistrate is to punish him for his idlenes; and to compell him to labour. The Magistrate, I say: for priuate persons haue no authoritie to inflict punishment in this case. As for the other sort, that are vnable to worke, they are not allowed by the word of God, to gather their almes themselues by begging from doore to doore, but to be re∣leeued at home in their houses. Deut. 15. 4. There shall not be a begger in thee. v. 11. there shall be euer some poore in the land. Here the ho∣ly Ghost makes a plaine difference, between the poore and the begger, forbidding the one, and commanding to helpe the other. Saint Paul likewise distinguisheth of wi∣dowes, whereof some haue rich kindred, and they are to be prouided for by them, 1. Tim. 5. 4. Others are destitute of friends and kin∣dred, by whome they may be releeued, and such he willeth to be maintained by the Church. v. 16. And this is no toleration or ap∣probation of beggers. Againe, the begging of almes is the very seminarie of vagabonds, rogues, & stragling psōs, which haue no calling, nor are of any corporation, Church, or commonwealth. Yea it doth proclaime to the world, in the eares
of all men, the shame either of the Magistrate who restraines it not, hauing authoritie: or of the wealthie and able, that they haue no mercy or compassion. It is also a great disor∣der in commonwealths. For the boldest and most clamarous begger, carries away all the almes from the rest: and so releefe is distribu∣ted both vnwisely and vnequally. And how∣soeuer it is the good law of our Land, agree∣able to the law of God, that none should begge that are able to labour, and all men are bound in conscience to see it obserued, that haue any care of the good of this Church and commonwealth: yet it is a plague of our times, and greatly to be bewailed, that it is neglected, and not put i executi∣on. In the Second place it is demanded, whe∣ther we must put a difference betweene per∣sons and persons, in giuing our almes. Ans. There be three differences of men, that are in neede. The first, is a mans owne: And such are they, that be of his houshold, for which he that makes not provision, is worse then an Infidell, as the Apostle speaketh, 1. Tim. 5. 8. Those also which are of a mans own blood, as father and mother, &c. Mat. 15. 5, 6. Now contrarie to this sort are strangers, to whome we must not giue. For to neglect a mans own, and to bestowe it vpon forrainers, vnlesse there be iust and necessarie cause so to doe,
is a sinne against the law of nature A second difference of men is this. Some are of the houshold of faith. Saint Pauls rule is this, that we preferre them before the other, Gal. 6. 10. Doe good vnto all men, but spe∣cially to them that are of the houshold of faith. A third difference. Some are our owne poore, of our towne, land, & country: & some be strangers in the same respects. Now, how∣soeuer we are debters to all that we can doe good to: yet those that are neerer to vs in habitation or neighbourhood, are to be re∣spected and releeued before others. This the Lord commandeth, Deu. 15. 7. If one of thy brethren with thee be poore, within any of thy gates in thy land, which the Lord thy God giueth thee; thou shalt not harden thy hart, and shut thine hand from him. And these beeing releeued, we may in the next place afford our helpe to o∣thers. Thus did the good Samaritane, in case of necessitie, practize his charitie vpon a stranger, Luk. 10. 33. and is therefore com∣mended by our Sauiour Christ. III. Question. How much releefe must e∣very man giue? Ans. We must put a difference betweene the almes of priuate men, and of Incorporati∣ons or Churches. Touching priuate mens almes, the Scripture hath not determined
how much must be giuen, but hath left it to the discreet consideration of euery Christian. And yet it must be remembred, which the Apostle saith, that he that soweth sparingly, shal reape sparingly. And againe, Let euery man giue, as he hath determined in his owne heart. Lastly, he giues a commandement touching the quantitie of giuing, that euery first day of the weeke, euery one lay aside by himselfe, and lay vp as God hath prospered him; that is, ac∣cording to the abilitie, wherewith God hath blessed him. 1. Cor. 16. 2. But two cautions are proprounded in the word, touching this quantitie. First, that we must not so giue almes, that others be ased, and we our selues grieued. 2. Cor. 8. 13. It is not Gods will, that we should giue all that we haue in almes, and keepe nothing for our selues, but that we keepe a due proportion in giuing, and doe that good to others, whereby we may not our selues be hindred or oppressed. Our foū∣taines and riuers must runne, to serue the ne∣cessitie of the stranger, in vse. Prov. 5. 16, 17. But yet the right must remaine our owne, we may not giue away fountaine and water, and all. Luk. 3. 11. He that hath two coates, let him part with him that hath none, that is, he that hath things necessarie and in abundance, let him giue freely, yet so as he reserue one coate to himselfe. Here the Papist is iustly to be blamed, who
holdeth it a state of perfection, to giue away all, and to liue by begging. For this can not be, seeing it is against Gods commandement, who will haue some giuen, and not all, one coate not both, and so is a state rather of sinne and imperfection. Secondly, in the case of extreame necessi∣tie (and not otherwise,) we must enable our selues to giue almes, though it be by the sel∣ling of our possessions, Luk. 12. 33. Sel that ye haue, and giue almes: our Sauiours mea∣ning is, in the case of extreame necessitie; when there is no other way to releeue those that are to be releeued. Dauid notes it as a propertie of a mercifull man, that he disperseth abroad, and giues to the poore, Psal. 112. 9. It was practised by the Primitiue Church, in the times of persecution, in the like case. Act. 4. 34. 35. And the Church of Macedonia, though they were in want themselues, yet supplied the extreame want of other Chur∣ches. 2. Cor. 8. 1, 2. Now touching the almes of whole bo∣dies, and Churches, this is the Rule: that, they should maintaine the poore with things ne∣cessarie, fit, and conuenient, as meate, drinke, and cloathing. 1. Tim. 5. 16. And this serues to conute a grosse errour, maintained by learned Papists; who hold, that whatsoeuer a man hath, aboue that which is necessarie, to nature and estate, he should giue it in almes. But the truth is otherwise: for a man
may and ought to giue almes more liberally, when he hath abundance, yet so, as he is not bound to giue all, but may reserue euen part of his superfluitie, for the publicke vse of Church and Common-wealth. And to this purpose, is that which our Sauiour saith, luk. 3. 1. He that hath two coates, that is, things necessarie and superfluous, must giue but one, and that in the case of the greatest necessitie; meaning thereby, that all superfluitie must not be giuen in almes, sauing onely in the case aforesaid of extreame want. IV. Question. How many waies is a man to giue almes? Ans. Three waies. First, by free giuing to the poore. Secondly, by free lending: for this is oftentimes, as beneficiall to a man, as gi∣uing. For this ende, there was a law giuen, Deut. 15. 8. Thou shalt open thy hand vnto thy poore brother, and lend him sufficient for his neede which he hath. Luk. 6. 35. Lend, looking for no∣thing againe. Exod. 22. 25. If thou lend money to the poore with thee, thou shalt not be an vsurer vnto him, thou shall not oppresse him with vsurie. Thirdly, by remitting due debt, in case of mens decay and extreame pouertie. Exod. 22. 26. If thou take thy neighbours rayment to pledge, thou shalt restore it vnto him, before the sunne goe downe. 27. For that is his couering onely, and this
is his garment for his skin: wherein shal he sleepe? therefore when he crieth vnto me (for colde and necessitie) I will heare him: for I am mercifull. According to this law, Nehemiah exhorteth the Rulers and Princes of the Iewes, that had oppressed their poore countrey-men, saying, Renit vnto them the hundreth part of the siluer, and of the corne, of the wine, and of the oyle, that ye exact of them for loane. Nehem. 5. 11. V. Question. How should almes be giuen, that they may be good workes, and pleasing vnto God? Ans. For the right manner of giuing, sundry things are required, but specially these sixe. First, a man must consecrate himselfe, and all the gifts that he hath & enioyeth, to God and his honour. This dutie is commended in the Church of Macedonia, that they gaue their owne selues, first to the Lord, and after vnto them that were in neede, by the will of God. 2. Cor. 8. 5. And thus the Prophet Esay foretelleth, that the citie Tyrus being conuerted, should con∣secrate themselues, and their goods to the Lord. Esa. 23. 18. Yet her occupying and her wa∣ges shall be holy vnto the Lord: it shal not be laid vp nor kept in store, but her marchandise shall be for them that dwell before the Lord, to eate suffi∣ciently, and to haue durable cloathing. Secondly, we must giues almes in faith.
How is that? first, we must be perswaded, that we are reconciled to God in Christ, and stand in his fauour: and then our almes shall be accepted. For, no worke of the person can please God, before the person himselfe be approoued of him. Secondly, we must de∣pend vpon God by faith, for the good suc∣cesse of our almes. Saint Paul compares the poore man to a field well tilled, and almes to the sowing of seede, which hath a most plen∣tifull haruest of blessing following it, 2. Cor. 9. 6. Now as the husbandmā, casting his seed into the earth, waiteth vpon God for the fruit thereof, Iam. 5. 7. so must the good man that giues almes, depend vpon God for the euent thereof. Salomon saies, He that hath mercy vpon the poore, lendeth to the Lord, and the Lord will recompence him that which he hath gi∣uen, Prou. 19. 17. Vpon these groūds must our faith rest, when we doe good to the poore. Thirdly, we must giue in simplicitie. Rom. 12. 8. He that distributeth, let him doe it with simplicitie, that is, of meere pity and compas∣sion, and not for any sinister respect, pleasure, or praise of men. Mat. 6. 3. When thou dost thine almes, let not thy left hand know, what thy right hand doth. Fourthly, we must giue in loue. 1. Cor. 13. 3. Though I feede the poore with all my good: &c. and haue not loue, it profiteth me nothing. Fiftly, in iustice. For we must not giue other mens goods, but our owne truly gotten. Esa.
58. 7. The true fasting is, to breake thine owne bread to the hungrie, to bring the poore that wan∣der, into thine owne house, &c. Sixtly, with a bountifull and chearefull minde. 2. Cor. 9. 7. As euery man wisheth in his heart, so let him giue, not grudgingly, or of neces∣sitie: for God loueth a chearefull giuer. Our al∣mes must not be extorted, but franke & free. And hence it followeth, that there ought to be no begging from doore to doore, in a Christian Commonwealth. For that shewes, that men part with their almes, of a niggardly and compelled minde. And thus much of the Remedie. Sect. 2. In the next place followeth the Fruit of the Remedie, in these words, And all things shall be cleane vnto you. Here first, I will speake of the false, and then of the true and right fruit of Liberalitie. The false Fruit is this, that, giuing of almes doth merit forgiuenes of sinne, and satisfie the iustice of God, for the temporall punish∣ment thereof. That we may the better see the errour of this doctrine, I will answer their arguments. Obiect. I. First, they alleadge out of this text, that giuing of almes makes all things cleane vnto vs. Ans. We must vnderstand the text, thus. If we turne to God, beleeue in Christ, and
leaue all our sinnes, then are we cleane, and all our actions, and consequently our almes∣giuing shall be cleane vnto vs: for to the pure all things are pure. Now almes and o∣ther things, are then said to be cleane vnto a man, when he beeing himselfe pure, maketh and hath a pure vse of them. Obiect. II. Dan. 4. 24. Redeeme thy sinnes, by giuing of al. Ans. This place maketh against the Pa∣pists: for by sinnes, the Prophet vnderstandeth both the guilt, & also the punishment. Whereas they affirme, that the guilt of sinne cannot be redeemed, but by Christ alone, and man one∣ly is to satisfie for the temporall punishment of sinne. Secondly, the word which they tran∣slate redeeme, doth properly signifie (as it is in the Chalde paraphrase) to breake off. As if the Prophet should haue said, Thou art, O King, a mightie Monarch, and thou hast vsed much iniustice and crueltie: therefore, now repent thy selfe, and breake off the course of thy sinnes, and testifie thy repentance, by doing iustice, and giuing almes to the poore, whom thou hast oppressed. Thirdly, the word in the ancient Latine translations, signifieth to amende; and then it beareth this sense: A∣mend thy selfe, and the course of thy life, and let thine iniustice be turned into iustice, thy crueltie into mercie. Obiect. III. Make you friends with the ri∣ches of iniquitie, that when ye shall want, they
may receiue you into euerlasting habitations, Luk. 16. 9. Ans. Receiuing here mentioned, is not by way of merit, as though a man could de∣serue it by giuing almes, but either by way of heartie praiers made by the poore, that they may be receiued, or els because their almes shall be vnto them a pledge and earnest, of their receiuing into Gods king∣dome. Obiect. IV. Prou. 16. 6. By mercie and truth, iniquitie is redeemed. Ans. 1. Salomons meaning is, that by Gods goodnes, and not ours, iniquity is par∣doned. 2. If by mercie, is meant mans mer∣cie, then are we to vnderstand it thus; that mercie and truth, are euident signes vnto vs that our sinnes are forgiuen, and not the working causes of remission. Obiect. V. Luk. 14. 14. And thou (which giuest releefe) shalt be blessed, because they can not recompense thee: therefore almes doe me∣rit. Ans. When God promiseth reward to the giuing of almes, the promise is not made to the worke, but to the worker, and that not for the merit of his person, or worke, but onely for Christ his sake, in whome he is, by whose meanes he stands reconciled vnto God. And so men that practise charitie in gi∣uing of almes, are rewarded with blessed∣nes, not for their almes, but according to
the mercie of God in Christ. Now followeth the Right fruit of Almes∣giuing: and it stands in foure things. First, they are the way in which we must walke to life euerlasting. I say the way, not the cause either of life, or any other good thing, that God hath promised. Secondly, they are effects and fruits of our faith: yea, the signes and seales of Gods mer∣cie to vs in Christ. To this purpose, S. Paul wi∣sheth Timothie, 1. Tim. 6. 17, 18, 19. to charge them that be rich in this world, that they doe good, and be rich in good workes, and be rea∣die to distribute, laying vp in store for themselues a good foundation, against the time to come, that they may obtaine eternall life. Now where is this foundation to be laide vp? not in hea∣uen, for that is impossible for vs, and it is laide vp for vs there alreadie by Christ; but in our owne consciences, and that is our as∣surance of Gods fauour in this world, and life euerlasting in the world to come: of which assurance, this and other good works, are signes and seales vnto vs. Thirdly, almes comes in the way of resti∣tution of those goods, that haue beene got∣ten fraudulently, though from whome, we know not. Thus Zacheus at his conuersion, for wrongs that he had done, he knew not to whome, gaue halfe his goods to the poore, and proclaimed restitution to those that could come forth and chalenge him.
Lastly, aimes are a notable remedie against couetousnesse. For he that hath a mercifull heart, to bestow vpon the poore, shall easily be content with that he hath, and auoid that sinne whereby otherwise he falls into tenta∣tions and snares of the Deuill. 1. Tim. 6. 9. CHAP. VI. Of Iustice. Psal. 15. 2. He that walketh vprightly, and worketh righteousnes. THe substance of the whole Psalme is a Question, and an Answer. The Question is, who are the members of Gods Church vpon earth, that shall come to life eternall in heauē. ver. 1. The Answer, is made in the rest of the Psalme. And in this answer, is contained a description of the parties, by their proper∣ties and markes. The first marke is, walking vprightly; that is, in truth and sinceritie of re∣ligion, which standeth in the sinceritie of faith, and a good conscience. The second note, is the practise of Righteousnes. Now Righteousnes, or Iustice, is two∣fold: the Iustice of the Gospel, and the Iu∣stice of the Law.
Evangelicall iustice is that, which the gos∣pell reveales, and not the Law; to witte, the obedience of Christ in his sufferings, and ful∣filling of the law, imputed to them that be∣leeue for their iustification; and this is not here meant. Legall iustice is that, which the law revea∣leth, and withall requireth. And it is either vniuersall, or particular. Vniuersall iustice, is the practise of all vertues: or that, whereby a man obserues all the commandements of the law. Of this Paul speaketh, Rom. 10. 5. in which place, he opposeth it to the righteousnes, which is by faith. And Zacharie and Elizabeth, are said to be iust before God, Luk. 1. 6. namely, by this vniuersall iustice; because they walked in all the commandements, and ordinances of the Lord, indeauouring in althings to please him. Particular iustice is that, whereby we giue to euery man his right, or due: and of this Dauid here speaketh. The reason is, because if it were not so, then this second marke should comprehend vnder it all the rest; and so there would be no good distinction of these properties, one from the other. Particular iustice, is two-fold; in distributi∣on, or in exchange, and contract. Iustice in di∣stribution is that, which keepes a proporti∣on in giuing to euery man that honour, dig∣nitie, reuerence, reward, or punishment, that
is due vnto him. Of this, there are mooued principally two Questions. I. Question. What is that iudgement, which men are to giue, and hold, one to and of another? Ans. Iudgement, is of two sorts: publicke, and priuate. Publicke, which is giuen and administred by a publicke person, in a publicke place. Such is the iudgement of the Magistrate, when he acquitteth or condemneth men, as their deserts are, to temporal punishment. Of which we may read, 2. Cron. 19. 6. Psal. 58. 1. Such also is the iudgement of the Prophet, or Minister, whereby he doth openly pro∣noūce to mē, that beleeue & repent, that their sinnes are remitted, or retained, 1. Cor. 14. 24. or that, whereby he delivereth obstinate sin∣ners vp vnto Satan, by the censure of Excom∣munication, or Suspension. 1. Cor. 5. 3. 4. 5. Priuate iudgement is that, whereby one man giues iudgement privately of another. And touching it, we are to consider two points. First, of what things iudgement must be giuen. Secondly, how we are to giue iudgement. For the first; we must giue iudgement of
three sorts of things; of mens facts, of their doctrines, and of their persons. Touching facts; the Apostle Paul would not haue vs to haue fellowship, with the vnfruitfull workes of darkenes, Eph. 5. 11. but rather to reprooue them, because they are subiect to our iudge∣ment: and being reprooued by vs, they are iudged of vs. And our Sauiour doth there∣fore command vs, when our brother trespas∣seth against vs, to goe and reprooue him, because Matth. 18. 15. his actions are liable to our censure. Secondly, the doctrines of men are to be iudged by vs. Try the Spirits, whether they are of God, or no, 1. Ioh. 4. 1. The spirituall man iudgeth all things, that is, all doctrines. 1. Cor. 2. 15. And our Sauiour saith, You shall know them by their fruits; that is, partly by their doctrine, & partly by their liues, being iudged according to the rule of Gods word. Mat. 7. 20. Thirdly, we may iudge of the persons of men. Now men are of two sorts: either in the Church, or out of the Church. The members of the Church, must be iudged by the iudge∣ment of charitie, not of infallibility. They that are out of the Church, we must suspend our iudgements concerning them, and leaue it to God. For, what haue I doe (saith the Apo∣stle) to iudge those that are without? 1. Cor. 5. 12. We may try and examine the person, but we must reserue the iudgement of condemnati∣on to God alone. The second point, is; How we are to iudge
one of another. Ans. The right manner of iudging accor∣ding to the word of God, I will lay downe in sixe Rules. The first is; If we know any good thing by any man, whether vertue, or action, we are willingly to speake of it, to commend it, and glorifie Gods name in it, and for it. Thus Paul affirmeth, that the Churches of Iudaea, when they heard the word which he preached, glo∣rified God for him. Gal. 1. 23. The second Rule; If we know any euill, sinne, vice, or offence by any man, there is a time when we may, and a time when we may not speake of it, and that with good conscience. For the better keeping of this Rule, foure cautions are to be remembred. First, he that will giue sentence of another man, must in the first place, purg and reforme himselfe. To this purpose, Christ comman∣deth, first to plucke the beame out of our owne eie, and then shal we see clearely, to cast out the more out of our brothers eie. Matth. 7. 5. And he that will not doe this, in iudgeing another, he condemneth himselfe. Rom. 2. 1. Secondly, we must be rightly and truly in∣formed in the matter, before we giue iudge∣ment. This was Gods owne practize, who came downe to see, whether the sinne of Sodome was answerable to the crie, Gen. 18. 21. Thirdly, our loue and charitie, must order
and direct, both our speech and our iudge∣ment of others, that we speake not of them without deliberation. For he that vpon ha∣tred, reports the euill he knoweth by ano∣ther, is a backebiter. When Doeg the Edo∣mite came, & shewed Saul that Dauid was gone to the house of Abimelech, he tolde no more then the truth; and yet because it proceeded from an euill minde, therefore Dauid accuseth him of hatred, backebiting, slaundering, and vnrighteousnes. Psalm. 52. 1. 2. Fourthly, he that speakes the euill he knowes by his neighbour, must haue the te∣stimonie of his owne conscience, to assure him that he hath a calling to doe it. Now a man is called by God, in three ca∣ses. First, when he is commanded by the Ma∣gistrate, to testifie what he knoweth. Second∣ly, when an euill that is in his neighbour, is to be redressed by admonition. Thirdly, when an euill is to be preuented, that it spread not abroad to the infection of others. These caueats obserued, we may speake the euill we know by others, truly and with an vpright conscience. But if they cannot be concealed, rather then a man should blaze a∣broad the faults of others, wherevnto he is privie, he ought to be silent: remembring al∣waies the saying of Salomon, that it is the glory of a man, to passe by an infirmitie, and not to take notice therof, but by loue to couer a multi∣tude
of sinnes. Prov. 19: 11. The third Rule. When a mans speech or a∣ction, is doubtfull, and may be taken either well or ill, we must alwaies interpet it in the better part. When Christ was brought be∣fore Caiphas the high priest, there came two witnesses against him, who affirmed some∣thing of him, which he had spoken: but be∣cause they changed and misconstrued his words, turning them to a wrong sense, ther∣fore they are called by the Holy Ghost, to their perpetuall shame and reproch, false wit∣nesses. Mat. 26. 90. Againe, the Apostle saith, that Loue thinkes no euill, 1. Cor. 13. 5. there∣fore loue takes euery speech and action in the better sense. The fourth Rule. Touching secret offen∣ces of our neighbour, we must suspend our iudgement of them. The reason is, because loue alwaies hopes the best, and thinkes no euill, 1. Cor. 13. 5. And our Sauiours rule is, If thy brother trespasse against thee, first reprooue him priuately, betweene thee and him, and goe no further, if that will preuaile. Mat. 27. 15. The fift Rule. Against an Elder, receiue not an accusation vnder two or three witnesses, 1. Tim. 5. 19. By an Elder, vnderstand ministers, civill gouernours, and all superiours. And if we must not receiue, then much lesse may we frame an accusation against them. This may be a lesson for all inferiours to learne, who take libertie to themselues, to speake what
euill they please of their gouernours. The sixt Rule is, concerning ministers. The Spirit of the Prophets, is subiect to the Pro∣phets, and not to priuate persons, 1. Cor. 14. 32. Indeede priuate persons haue power to examine and try their doctrine and ministry: but they must goe no further: for they haue no power to giue iudgement, either of their ministers doctrin, or persons. The doctrine & manners of teachers, are subiect to the cen∣sure of Prophets onely. For example: A pri∣uate man saies, that he may excommunicate, at his pleasure, those that sinne, if he proceed according to the three degrees mentioned, Mat. 18. But this is in him a fault; for he must not iudge in this case, at his owne pleasure, but his iudgement must follow the iudge∣ment of the Church: and when the Church hath giuen censure, then may the priuate man proceede to censure, and not before. So saith our Sauiour Christ, Mat. 18. 17. If he heare not the Church, after the Church hath iudged him, let him be vnto you as a heathen & a publicane. Here if the Question be made, how a man may with good conscience giue iudgement of his owne selfe? I answer, by obseruing two Rules. First, a man must alwaies in the presence of God, iudge himself in regard of his sinnes, both of hart & life, 1. Cor. 11. 31. If we should iudge our selues, we should not be iudged. And this iudge∣ment
of a mans selfe, must not be partiall, but sharpe and seuere, with true humiliation and lowlines of heart. For this is a true ground of all charitable iudgement of others. Second∣ly, before men a man must suppresse his iudgement of himselfe, and be silent: no man is bound either to praise or dispraise, to ex∣cuse or accuse and condemne himselfe be∣fore others: and grace must teach him thus much, not vainely to commend or boast of of his owne gifts and actions; but rather to burie them in silence, and referre them to the iudgement of others. Now to conclude this point. The doctrine deliuered, is most necessarie for these times. For the fashion of most men is, to giue rash and sinister iudgement of others; but them∣selues they will commend, and that highly. If any thing be euill saide or done, all men must haue notice of it. If a thing be doubt∣full, it is alway construed in the worser part. If a thing be done of weaknes and infirmitie, we aggrauate it, and make it a double sinne. We are curious in searching and inquiting into the liues of others, that we may haue something to carpe and finde fault with. But let this be remembred, that as we iudge, so we shall be iudged; first, of God by condem∣nation, and then by hard and vnequal iudge∣ment from others. Againe, what is it that makes men to be open mouthed, in decla∣ring and censuring our faults, but this; that
we open our mouthes to the disgrace and defamation of others? Wherefore, if we would haue other men to iudge of vs, and our actions in loue, we must also make con∣science, to giue charitable iudgement of them. II. Question. How one man should honour an other? Ans. That we may rightly honour men, we must first know the causes, for which men are to be honoured. And that the causes of honour may be conceiued, I will lay downe this Ground. Honour is in the first place, princi∣pally and properly, to be giuen vnto God. 1. Tim. 1. 17. To God onely wise, be honour and glorie. The reason hereof is rendered in the Lords pray∣er; be cause his is kingdome, power, and glorie. Againe, God is goodnes it selfe: his goodnes and his essence are one and the same: there∣fore honour is due to him in the first place. Now euery creature as it commeth neare vn∣to God, so it is honourable, and the more honourable, by how much nearer it com∣meth vnto him. But man especially, by how much nearer he commeth to God in diuine things, by so much more is he to be honou∣red in respect of other creatures. From this Ground doe follow these Conclusions. First, that Man is first of all to be honou∣red,
for vertues sake: because therein princi∣pally, standes the internall image of God, Rom. 2. 10. To euery man that doth good, shal be honour, glorie, & peaece; to the Iew first &c. Now whereas the Question might be, Who is the Iew, to whome this honour must be yeelded? Paul answers, vers. 29. that he is not a Iew, which is one outward, but he is a Iew, who is one within. And the circumcision is of the heart. And Salomon saith, that Honour is vn∣seemely for a foole, Prou. 26. 1. And the Holy Ghost to the Hebrewes saith, that by faith, our Elders were well reported of. The Heathen man Heb. 11. 2. Marcus Marcellus a Romane, dedicated a Tē∣ple to the Goddesse of Honour, and the way to that temple was, by the house of Vertue. The Second Conclusion is, That man is to be honoured, not onely for vertue, but also for diuine representations of other good things: in a word, because one man before an other, heareth the image of some thing that is in God. As First, of his Maiestie. Thus the King is honoured, because in his Maiestie and state, he carrieth a resemblance of the power and glorie of God: so as that which is saide of God, may be also spoken of him. Hence it was, that Daniel said to Nebuchad∣nezar: O King, thou art a King of Kings, and why? for the God of heauen hath giuen thee kingdome, power, strength and glorie, Dan. 2. 37. Secondly, of his Dominion. Thus the husband is to be honoured of the wife, because he
beareth before the woman, the image of the glorie of God; yea, of his prouidence, wise∣dome, Lordship, and gouernment. 1. Cor. 11. 7. Thirdly, of his Paternitie: and so the father is honoured of the sonne, because he beares in his person the image of Gods pa∣ternitie, or father-hoode. Fourthly, of his E∣ternitie; and hence it is, that honour is giuen to the aged before the young man, because he beareth the image thereof. Thus we see that Diuine representations, doe imprint a kinde of excellencie, in some persons, and consequently doe bring forth honour. The third Conclusion is, That men are to be honoured, euen for the vertues of others. Thus the sonnes of Princes, are called by the honourable name of Princes. The children of Nobles, are esteemed by birth Noble. Thus Dignities doe runne in discent, and the posteritie is honoured in the name of the an∣cestours, but principally for the vertues of the ancestours. The fourth Conclusion is, Men are to be ho∣noured for their Riches. I meane not for ri∣ches simply, but for the right vse of riches; namely, as they are made instruments, to vp∣hold and maintaine Vertue. If it be said, that to honour rich men, is to haue the faith of the Lord Iesus Christ in re∣spect of persons, Iam. . 1. I answer: In that place, we are not sorbidden to honour rich men: but the Apostles meaning is, to re∣prooue
a fault of an other kinde, when men preferre riches before pietie; when rich men are honoured beeing vngodly, and when godly poore men are despised and reiected, because they are poore. Now hauing premised the Ground, we come to giue Answer to the Question be∣fore propounded. A man therefore is to ho∣nour euery one in his place, whether he be his superiour, equall, or inferiour. Yea there is a kinde of honour to be performed to a mans owne selfe. The truth of this Answer we shall see in the particulars that follow. Sect. 1. Touching the honouring of Superiours, these Ruies are to be obserued. First: All Superiours must haue reuerence done vnto them, whether they be Superiours in age, in gifts, in authoritie, or howsoeuer, and that because they are superiours. The actions of Reuerence due to all supe∣riours, are principally sixe. The first is, to rise vp before the superiour. Levit. 19. 32. Thou shalt rise vp before the boare head, and honour the person of the old man. The second, when they are comming toward vs, to goe and meete them. Thus, when Abraham saw the three Angels comming toward him, he ranne to meete them from the tent doore, Gen. 28. 2. And king Salomon, when his mother Bath∣sheha came towards him, to speak vnto him
for Adoniah, the text saith, he rose vp to meete her, 1. King. 2. 19. The third, to bow the knee before the superiour. Thus wee read in the Gospell, that a certaine man comming to Christ, as he was going on the way, kneeled vnto him, Mark. 10. 17. Thus Abraham ranne to meete the three Angels, and bowed him∣selfe to the ground. Gen. 28. 2. And the same Abraham, els where, bowed himselfe before the people of the Land of the Hittites, Gen. 23. 7. The fourth, to giue them the first and highest seat or place. This our Sauiour Christ meaneth in the parable, wherein he willeth those who are invited to a banquet, to yeeld the chiefest place to them, that are more ho∣nourable then themselues. Luk. 14. 7. And it is set downe as a commendation of Iosephs brethren, that they sate before him in order, the eldest according to his age, & the young∣est according to his youth, Gen. 43. 33. Here we must remember; that though in common practise among men, the right hand is a note of superioritie, yet in Scripture the practise is contrarie. For in the article of our Creede, Sitting at the right hand signifieth, the inferio∣ritie of the Mediator, in respect of the father; though it be a token of his superioritie, in re∣gard of the Church. And so must the place be vnderstood, (1. King. 2. 19. where it is said, that Bathsheba sate at the right hand of Salomon,) namely, that it was an argument of Superioritie, whereunto he preferred her
before the people; but it shewed her infirmi∣tie in regard of Salomō himself. And this cu∣stome is frequent, both in the scriptures, & in humane writers. The fift, to giue libertie of speaking in the first place. This was the pra∣ctise of Elihu, one of the friends of Iob, who beeing the youngest in yeares, dared not to shew his opinion, till Iob and others, who were his ancients had spoken. But when they had left off their talke, then he is said to haue answered in his turne, Iob. 32. 6. 7. 17. The sixt, to giue the titles of reverence to all su∣periours. Sara according to this rule, called Abraham Lord, 1. Pet. 3. 9. The man in the Gospell, comming to learne something of Christ, cals him by this name, Good Master, Mar. 10. 17. And Anna rebuked by Eli, an∣swered him with reuerence, and said, nay, my Lord. 1. Sam. 1. 15. The second Rule touching honour due to superiours, is more speciall, touching su∣periours in authoritie; namely that they also must be honoured. And this honour shewes it selfe in foure things. The first is, speciall reuerence: which stands in the performance of two duties. The for∣mer is, to stand when our superiors doe sitte. For thus Abraham after he had receiued the Angels into his tent, and prepared meat for them, serued himself by them vnder the tree, giuing attendance, while they did eate, Gen. 18. 8. In like manner, when Moses sate in
iudgement, the people are said to haue stood about him, from morning vntill euening, Ex∣od. 18. 13. The latter is, not to speake, but by leaue. A dutie alwaies to be obserued, but specially in the courts of Magistrates. Exam∣ple whereof we haue in Paul, who beeing called before Foelix the gouernour, did not speake a word, vntill the gouernour had bec∣kened vnto him, & giuē him leaue. Act. 24. 10. The second thing is, subiection; which is no thing els but an inferioritie, whereby we do (as it were) suspend our wills and reasons, and withall cause them to depend (in things lawfull and honest) vpon the will of the supe∣riour. This subiectiō is yeelded to the autho∣ritie of the superiour, and is larger then obe∣dience. The third is, obedience; whereby wee keepe and performe the expresse commandement of our superior, in all things lawfull and ho∣nest, It standeth in sundry particulars, as First, it must be in the Lord, and as to the Lord himselfe, Whatsoeuer ye doe (saith the Apostle,) doe it heartily, as to the Lord, and not vnto men, Col. 3. 23. Againe, obedience must be perfor∣med euen to superiours that are euill. Thus Peter exhorts seruants to be subiect to their Masters, in all feare, not onely to the good and courteous, but also to the froward, 1. Pet. 2. 18. Thirdly, it must be done to Rulers, in whome we see weaknesses. For their infir∣mities ought not to hinder or stoppe our du∣tie
of obedience, considering that the com∣maundement of honouring the father and mother is generall without exceptiō. Fourth∣ly, it is to be performed to them that are De∣puties to Rulers, yea which are deputies of deputies. Submit your selues (saith Peter) vnto all manner ordinance of man, for the Lords sake, whether it be vnto the King as vnto the superi∣our, or vnto gouernours, as vnto them who are sent of him, &c. 1. Pet. 2. 13, 14. Fiftly, though pu∣nishment be wrongfully, and most vniustly imposed by Rulers, yet it must be borne without resistance, till we can haue our re∣medie. For this is thankeworthie, if a man for conscience toward God, indure griefe, suffering wrongfully. 1. Pet. 2. 19. The practise of this we may see in Hagar, the handmaid of Sara, who is commanded by the Angel, to returne a∣gaine to her dame, and humble her selfe vn∣der her hands, though shee had dealt very roughly with her, Gen. 16. 9. The fourth thing due to Superiours in au∣thoritie, is Thankesgiuing, in praising God for their paines, authoritie, and gifts princi∣pally. Thus Paul exhorts, that praiers, interces∣sions, and thankesgiuing, be made for Kings, and all that be in authoritie, 1. Tim. 2. 1. The reason is, because beeing ouer vs in authoritie, we haue the benefit of their gifts and authoritie. Gen. 45. 9.
Sect. 2. In the second place commeth to be con∣sidered, our honour due vnto our Equalls. Concerning which, there be two Rules. I. Rule. Equalls, must esteeme better of others, then of themselues. Thus Paul exhorts all men, in meekenes of minde, without con∣tention or vaine-glorie, to esteeme others better then themselues. Phil. 2. 3. II. Rule. Equalls, in giuing honour, must goe one before another. Rom. 12. 10. where the Apostle saith not, in taking honour, be∣cause the dutie by him prescribed, concernes not all persons, but those alone who are of a like or equall condition. Sect. 3. A third sort, to whome honour is to be yeelded, are Inferiours. And the honour due vnto them is, without all contempt, in meek∣nes of Spirit, to respect them as brethren. This dutie the Lord commands expressely to the King; That his heart be not lifted vp a∣bove his brethren. Deut. 17. 20. The same was the practise of Iob, who saith of himselfe, that he did not contemne the iudgement of his seruant, or of his maid, when they did contend with him, Iob. 31. 13. Naaman the Syrian, thought it no disgrace, to be advised and or∣dered by the counsell of his seruants. 2. King. 5. 13. And true it is, that all superiours ought
to keepe their state and place; yet so, as they haue respect also to such as are inferiour to them, without scor or contempt. Sect. 4. Lastly, there is a kind of honour to be per∣formed to a mans owne selfe, which duty the Apostle exhorteth vnto, Phil. 4. 8. where he saith; If there be any vertue, if there be any pise, thinke on these things. By which he would teach vs, not onely to tender the honour of our superiours, equalls, and inferiours, but e∣uen of our selues, in seeking after vertue and praise that followeth after it. But how should a man in righteous man∣ner honour himselfe? Ans. By obseruing two rules. I. Rule. We must preserue our selues in body and soule; specially, we must keepe the bo∣dy, that it be not made an instrument of sinne. For when we doe vse our bodies as in∣struments of vncleanes, then doe we bring a shame vpon them. And it is the will of God, that euery man should know how to possesse his ves∣sel in holines and honour, 1. Thes. 4. 4. 5. And that which is said of the bodie, is to be vnder∣stood of the hand, the heart, the tongue, and all the parts and members thereof. II. Rule. If we would truly honour our selues, we must honour God in all our waies. For God will honour them, who honour him, 1. Sam. 2. 30. Now to honour God, is to honour
him according to his will and word, in the duties of good conscience and good life. On the contrarie, they that dishonour God, God will dishonour them before all the world. And this must teach vs, even to dedicate our selues to God and his providence, in the whole course of our callings, whether in the Church or Commonwealth. &c. &c. &c. &c. &c. &c.

Kind Reader. I intreate thee to be aduertised of two texts of Scripture, alleadged pag. 578, 579. in way of proofe of a rule there mentioned. They were quoted and vttered in those very tearmes by the Author himselfe: But because they faulted in some words, and were not for matter so well filled to the point in hand, as was meete, I set vpon them a marke in my Copie, either to be explaned or wholly left out. Yet beeing in my absence, through the Printers hast, slipped in, much against my will, and now past helpe, I am forced to desire thee, for the time, in loue to passe by the examples them∣selues; and onely to take the Rule for thy directi∣on, in the vse of borrowed ornaments. Farewell.
