JOHN DURY HIS PETITION TO THE HONOURABLE HOUSE OF THE COMMONS IN ENGLAND, NOW ASSEMBLED IN PARLIAMENT. LONDON, Printed in the yeere M.DC.XLI.
To the Honourable, the Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses met in Parliament, the humble Petition of JOHN DURY, Minister of the Gospel of JESUS CHRIST. Humbly sheweth, THat whereas for the space of more then ten yeers by-past, not without knowledge and permission of his Majesty, with the good liking, approbation, and furtherance of for∣raign Protestant Princes and States, and with advice, incouragement, and instigation of the chief Divines in all the Churches whom it doth concerne, the purpose of Ecclesiasticall reconcilement amongst Protestants hath been prosecuted, and the means thereof so farre advan∣ced, as in a private Theologicall way they can be prepa∣red; which by this adjoyned briefe relation will appear, and may be made more fully evident by other circum∣stances of the Worke. Therfore my humble suit is unto your Honourable As∣sembly, to be pleased to take this matter, which so much concerneth the glory of God, and the welfare of his Church, into your pious consideration, to countenance and assist religiously the same. And to this effect, if your wisdome think it expedi∣ent, some Act or Declaration might be made, First, That the blessed, and long sought for union of
Protestant Churches may bee recommended unto the publick prayers of the Church. And secondly, That either an Evangelicall correspon∣dency for mutuall edification, for healing of breaches, for taking away of scandals, and for the advancement of the Gospel of Jesus Christ amongst Protestants, should henceforth bee entertained with forraigne Churches, by those to whom the care of so blessed a worke may be with authority referred: Or that his Majesty, with your Honours advice and grave counsell, might bee moved to call together a generall Synod of Protestants in due time, for the better setling of weighty matters in the Church, which now trouble not onely the consciences of most men, but disturb the tranquillity of publick States, and divide the Churches one from another, to the great hinderance of Christianity, and the dishonour of Reli∣gion. All which evils by this means may bee taken out of the way, and from hence a great blessing of God, and much honour amongst men will redound to this Church and Nation: And I your humble Petitioner, as in duty bound, will daily pray for his Majesties long and happy reigne over us, and for the prosperous successe of this high and Honourable Court of Parliament.
