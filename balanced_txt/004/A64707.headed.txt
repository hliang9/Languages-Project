THE UNFORTUNATE Fortunate Marry'd-Man. JACK met his Friend Dick, and some Compliments past, He said, by the by, he had marry'd at last. That's well, quoth his Friend,— No not so well neither, For none but the Dev'l cou'd link us together; Her Tongue, without ceasing, by Night or by Day, As loud as a Tempest, as rough as the Sea! Poor Jack I lament thee, so hard is thy Fate! No, not so hard neither,— I got with my Kate A Brace of good Thousands; and thus Men of Skill, By gilding, can swallow the bitterest Pill Then Matters are better by far than I thought. No, Sir,—When you hear of the Bargain I bought, I laid it all out in some Sheep, like a Sot; And they all took the Scab, and they dy'd of the Rot. Alas, I lament thee,—For better for worse! Thy Wife and thy Money have both prov'd thy Curse. No, not so bad neither; I made up what's lost: For I got for the Skins quite as much as they cost. O ho did you so,—then your Losses are easy. And were your dear Katy but so, how 'twould please ye! No, not quite so easy, two Thousand good Pound, I gave for a House, which is burn'd to the Ground. Then Dick I lament thee, thou'rt ruin'd for Life. No, not so bad neither,—It burn'd my Wife.
