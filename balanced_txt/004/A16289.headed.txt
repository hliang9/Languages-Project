THe whyle yt rome was regnīg ī her flores And of ye world held al the monarchy She was gouerned then by emperours And was renouned wonder noblely Tyl pryde had set ther hertes vp on hy Then beganne they to vse crudelyte And regned by rygurnesse and tyranny And oppressed sore the comynalte ¶For leke as pouerte causeth sobernesse And feblenes enforceth continence Rygth so prosperite and sykernesse ys the moder of vyce and neglygence And pouer also causeth insoleuce And after honour changeth good maners Ther ys none so perilouse pestilence As ys hye astate geuen to srewes
¶Of the wich was Nero one and principal That such maner tiranny began Though he bare the diademe ymperial. yet was he a very cursed man.

He wold hym put in torment and in payn.
And he that wold hys Instes ofte withsayn. He ne was but ded yf that he wold appere. For such a cause Boecius was slayn. Of whom thys processe after treteth here ¶And rygth these dayes men may se thys same Of some yt haue the astate of gouernaunce. Ho so wyl ther vyces or lustes blame.

And Boyce that lay in pryson & in payn In exyle in the cyte of Papey In Melayn he made hym to be slayn In Papey ben hys bones sykerly ¶And when these messengers at ye laste Retorned were / in herte he gan to brenne Pope Iohn in prison then he caste Fer out in the cyte of Rauenne And made hym closed in a narowe denne wher he ne mygth torne hym selfe ne wende And soth to say he wente neuer thenne Tyl of hys lyffe he had made an ende ¶Also the worthy noble Symmacus That was a man grounded al in grace The wyche in vertu was heroicus Ther lefte not suche a nother as he was Vir heroicus ys a man geuen al to contemplation & to vertu / in vvhom al flesly passyous ben quenched & repressed. withoute cause surfyt or trespace At Rauenne eke he slewe hym cruelly And after wardes iu thatsame place The next yere he dyed sodenly ¶And as sent gregory doth hym self wryte As yet hys bokes maketh mentyon Ther was yt tyme a holy heremyte As he was in hys contemplation He dyd se Theodoryke in visyon Betwene Symacus and pope Iohn Ryght as a theffe to hys dampnation How he was led / & after that anone ¶In the Ile of vulcane was he caste then That ful ys of a fyre flam of hel

And al tho the vvorchyng of reson leke to practyf in or∣dre & {pro}cesse in vs that vseth processe go before intelligence as practycke goyth before theorich / & actyf before contemplatyfe / yet in vvorthines & also in perfection of blestulhed / intelligens sormounteth & ys souerayn to reson. For the same treuthes that reson seketh & fyndeth by discours / thes pure blisful spirites (vviche ben called iutelligences) seyth & knou∣eth perfectly in the mirrour of eternal lygth / that ys goddes sonne vith outen any discurse of reson. And moche more viche ne may not be perce¦ued here of ous in thys pilgremage. But rygth as a good practiser by exercise of labur & experiens of hys craft / may deserue to be made preuy of soteltes of hys crafte & to be made a master / rygth so a soule coniuned to bodly mater / may by hys good labour of discours / deserue to atteyu to be made preuy by intelligence of al the same trouthes on hye in blysse that thes blesful spirites haueth of ther firste creation. ¶By nature of the resonabelte of mannes soule / viche resonabelte ys the forme sub∣stantial of the selfe soule / ther shuld not be denyed hem that he vvolde desyre. And that may be scheued by thys skyle. ¶The saule vhos forme substaniial ys reson or resonabilte / he may of proper kynde noʒt desyre but resonable. for yf he other desired / he vvere vnresonable. And yf he desyre but that ys proper to hem of kynde / yt may not of reson be denyed hym. But hove ys hyt that a soule coniuned desyreth ofte other than resonable / Ther be .ii. causes. One ys for some soules for
the intemperance & bosteynesse of ther material body fayleth in discours In other that haueth clere discours yet sensualite vych vs the flesly part of the soule replyeth euer a gen thys discours of reson / askyng hys lustes as proper to hys kynder And togth he be ueuer o ofte ausuered & conclu¦ded / yet euer he resorteth to hys first askyng hauyur o regarde to al the resons that may be made agenste hym. Right as a man that fayleth dis¦cours vhom men calleth a mad man / tough a man make to hym neuer so gret resons / yet ys he not ansuered / he feleth them not / but euer he resorteth to that he firste began. ¶Thys importunat pressenge of sensualite of such vnresonable replications encombreth so the reson that he leueth the true ende that he had traueled for by discours & entendethe to the luste of sensualite desiryng thynges that be vnresonable / vvyche desyre yf yt vvere grounded in sensualite vych ys changeable / yt shulde a none bring the soule in to endles mischef. for ther may no thyng stand kyndly that contrarieth hys avne kynd. Ne a resonable spirite though he be moueable in vvorkyng & in affections yet of propre kynde he may not vvyl contradiction / that ys to sey nove thys & nov the contrary for then he erred agen reson So then a soule desiryng that thyug that ys vnresonable / & consequently to hys destruction / by the hy gouerne hyt ys oftentyme denyed hym. vherfore he falleth in to a peynful heuy∣nesse be cause he lacketh that he desireth / or hath that hym lotheth. And vvere not that the sensualite bereth thys peyn the mischef vvere en¦dles. vherfore the sensualite that ys changeable & lotheth thys peyn vyl¦lyng to be deliuered therof / somtyme reforteth to reson forsakyng suche vnskyleful desires & suffreth reson to haue hys kyndly operations. And yf thys peynful heuynesse be mored in the soule & reson fully ouercome / then falleth a man in despere. & so somme destroeth themself by vvylful deth & so continue in perpetual peyn vythout ende. Thus fel hyt of the first angel that desired vndiseretly to be leken to god & for he migthe not haue hys desyre / he fel in peynful heuinesse. but in heuen may be no peyn / And he miʒth not vvyl the contraty to that he ones villed / he vvas so pure & simple of nature. vherfore vvithout remedy he vvas caste in to mischef in the peyn of hel ¶So yt be fel of thys noble clerk Boyce / because he had that he vvold not / that vvas prison & other tribulation. And also he vvanted that he vvolde haue / that vvas hys astate in the cyte of Rome / hys hovse / bokes / & hys other goodes / pre¦sens of hys vvyffe & chyldern & hys other frendes vherof he vvas vvron gfully spoyled & but out of hys cyte / exiled as a traytour / he fel in to a peynful heuinesse and made hys complaint sayug. Allas I vvreche. &c̄. But for asmoche as thys heuynesse vvas but the mevyng of sensualite / viche of hys nature ys chaūgable. And leste he fel in to ful forgetyng of hymself & in the vttermest myschef. Reson conforteth the flesly kynde / reducyng yt to knovlege of yt selfe / & so to forgete the heuynesse that he vvas so greuosly peyned vvith for losynge of hys dignyte / vvyffe / chyl∣dern / & goodes a fore rehersed.

Aga¦menon. Vlixes. & Hercules. And for cause often tymes men eschevv¦eth grete actes for lacke of corage / vvyche corage ys blemesshed or op∣pressed: by iii. thynges in specyal. Ther fore he reherseth of thes vver¦ryours, certen dedes / in vvyche they shevved the myght of ther corage not hurt ne blemesshed by none of thes causes. One thyng ys that often letteth & vvythdraeth the force of mānes corage / fro myghty and manly dedes / that ys tendrenesse of herte and affection that he hathe other to vvordly thynges vvyche he delyteth vpon / Other to vvyffe & chyldren / kynred / or frenshyppe / vvyche he kepeth not to dysplese in vvythdrayng hys presence / nether in any other thyng / that myght be cause of mornyng or heuynesse. But a geynst thys carnalyte / he putteth the exsample of Agamenon. That vvhen he vvas saylynge to∣vvardes the sege of Troye / vvhen he came to the Ile of Aulydes /
hym lacked vvynde. Then vvas hyt shevved hym by vvycches & dyuynours / that yf he vvolde haue vvynde: he must slee hys doghter Ephigenie / & brenne her in sacryfyce to the plesance of Dyane. And not vvythstandyng that he loued hys doghter passyng al thynge / yet in hope of vyctory / he put a vvay the tendrenesse of faderly affection / and made hys hert pyteles to hys dere doghter / & so sloo her in sacryfyce. And so had he vvynde to hys vvyl / & suyngly the vyctory as he desyred ¶The second thynge that letteth a mannes corage ys: vvhen he hath seyn many peryshe for a certeyn purpose: vvych hym self desyreth / and fevve or none atteyn hyt vvyth prosperyte. A geyn thys a basshe¦ment / he putteth the second exsample of Vlixes. vvyche vvhen he had x. yeres erred saylyng in the see after the destruction of Troye & suffred many mysse aduentures / & specyally in transformation & lesynge of hys feloshyppe: by the cursed enchaunteresse Circes. Here he tellethe hovv the grete gyant Poliphemus vvyth one yee in hys frount / had deuored & destroyed hys people / And not vvythstandynge the myscheffe that al hys people had suffered / yet Vlixes a basshed hym noght / but vvayted vvhen thys gyant vvas a slepe / & sodenly put oute hys yee: And theu vvas he syker of hym / that he myght harme hym no more. & so he ven¦ged the morder of hys meyne▪ ¶The moralyte of thys fable / ys thys. Poliphemus ys as moche to say / as lesynge of fame: And he that recketh not of hys fame / may vvel be called one yeed. For he re∣gardeth not that ys to come: ne that ys passed. but only to hys present lustes. But Vlixes the vvyse man / hathe regard bothe to that ys gon: & to that that ys to come / & quencheth in hym self thys one ys of thes present lustes. And thogh so be that al the vvorlde for the more part / by rauesshynge of thys one ye / peresseth / foloynge thes momen∣taney lustes: and vnnethes any man ys that can or vvyl refrayn thē: yet Vlixes the vvyse mā: vvyl stoppe thys ye / & not excuse hym by the comen excuse of vvrecches saynge: Ho ys he that may vvythstand hys desyres / syth so many myghty men & vvyse haue ben dyscomfete of ther lustes. But he vvyl myghtly represse thes passyons by good gouernāce▪ And so venge hym self vpon hys gostely enemy. ¶The thyrde thynge that a basseth the corage: ys covvardyce: vvhē a mā haldeth hym self vnable to the labour that he puryoseth / and hys myght vnsuffycyant & vnmete to resyste that: that vvythstandethe hys vvyl & enteut. Agenste thys covvardyce: philosophia Inducethe the xii. labours of the myghty man Hercules / vvyche semeth to euery mannes hyrynge ferre to excede the myght of any man▪ yet not vvyth¦standyng / Hercules a basshed neuer hys corage: but myghtely {per}formed hys entent & purpos. vvherefore as philosophia concludeth he vvas revvarded vvyth a souereyn geft / and made a bryght shynyng sterre in the heuen a boue. ¶By thes myghty manues labours / ys geuen to ous an exsample / that ther may no thynge a basshe the corage of a vvyse man: vvher by he sholde leue the labour of vertuous leuynge / ne bodely exercyse in vertu shal not seme hym ouerhard to hys myght / but that he may performe hys entente & lust. so shal hys desyre be enforced
vvyth desyre & ful hope to heuenly Ioy. ¶The fyrst labour: the proude Centaurus made he tame: Of thes Centaurus ys sayd be forn / That Ixion gate them of a cloude / vvhen he vvolde haue oypressed Iuno. But vvhat vvyse that Hercules tamed them / hyt ys expressed by the commentor thus. vvhen that thes Cen¦taurus in a certen tyme vvere come to gedres in the mount of Pheloe to a pley that vvas called Palestra / vvyche vve calle vvrastelyng / Her¦cules so sore asset them in vvrastelyng / that they bledde. ¶Also another tyme Hercules comyng oute of spayne vvas logged in the den of Tyro Centaurus that vvas one of the heffe masters. And as thys Tyro handeled an aroe / vvyth vvyche Hercules hadde slayn a serpent the venemous aroe fel vpon hys fote / and made hym a vvonde / that vvas vncurable. The thyrde tyme hyt fel that Hercules vvyth hys loue Deiamra tornyng tovvard hys contre / come to the ryuer of He∣uenū / And vvhen he taryed for caryage of hys vvyffe: Neffus Centau¦rus bade hym svvymme ouer before: & he vvold bryng her after. And vvhen that Hercules vvas come to lande / he loked after hys vvyffe / & he savv Centaurus a boute for to oppressen her / And a none vvyth a venemous aroe he shet hym thoro the hert & svve hym. And thus he tamed the proude Centaurus. ¶To the litceral truthe of thys tale. Ixion that vvas called the fader of the Centaurus / vvas the fyrst that ordeyned horsemen for to ryde in grece / and gadred of them a hundred & vvasted sore the contrey. And vvhen the rude people dyd see them so smartly prykng in and oute / they vvend hyt had ben bestes / half hors and half mē. And at last thes myghty Hercules faught vvith them & destroyed them. ¶By thes Centaurus geten of the cloude may be vnderstande suche men as ben exalted in to hye astates / not by meret of ther vertues / but by fauour of lordshyppe / & by ther vayn ple¦saunce. They ben half bestes & half men / bestly in ther leuyng / raue¦ners & extorcyoners: & leke men in pleasaunce to ther lordes Hercules the vertuous shal spare none offence of ther hye astates / ne drede of ther tyrāny / but boldly repreue them of ther vyces / & make them to loke as men sholde. ¶The second of Hercules vvas that he strepte the Lyon out of hys skyn. The truthe of thys labour vvas thys: Ther vvas a passyng hugy Lyon in the forest of Nemeas: vvyche sore a frayed the people of the contrey. vvyche Lion hercules slvve / & strept the skyn: & bare vvyth hym in sygne of vrctory. By thys Lyon ys vnderstande / proude & fers tyrantes: that delyteth al in rauen and py¦lyng of the people / hauyng no pytey vpon the poure. Thes men a vertuous man sholde spoyle of ther poure / & suffer none suche to bere astate of offce. ¶The thyrde labour vvas that he sher the herpyas vvyth aroes. ¶Syneus put oute the yees of hys sonnes / because they had accused ther stepmoder of adultery. vvherfore by Jugement of goddes he vvas blynded hym self / and had certen foules aboute hym vvyth may∣den heddes / that defoyled hys table & bare a vvay hys mete. Thes foules Hercules slvve and droue oute of contrey
¶By thes Herpyas may vvel be vnderstande rennets or ryders ouer the contre / couered vnder lordshyp / as menstrelles & Ioculers and such other / that cometh in to householdes of vvorthy men / & eteth and de∣uoreth ther vytelles / And but they haue also geftes / they vbyl defoule the table / despysyng the persons / And vvhen they ben passed / speke vylenously by al the household. Suche people a vertuous man sholde not cherysshe for fere of vvordes / but rebuke them of thys foule maners / and so destroy that foule vyce and vnhonest vsage. ¶The fourth labour vvas: that he gate the golden apples fro the dra¦gon. As Lucanus feyneth Athlaus had vii. doghters / vvyche had a gardenful of golden apples / vvych garden vvas taken to kepe to a dragon / that alvvay vvas vvakyng. But Hercules by crafte made thys dragon to slepe / and so bare a vvay the apples: and broght them to Euristeus the kyng. By thes vii. doghters of Athlaus / ben vnderstande the vii. artes liberal. Thes damseles haue a garden / that ys the lybrary disperse a monges clerkes. Appel trees ben bokes / the apples ben sotel sentence of vvysedom / vvych the vvakynge dragon / that ys the sensualyte of man hathe to kepe. vvych ys euer vvakyng to lustes and delytes / and so letteth the soule fro connyng. But Her∣cules the vertuous man oppresseth hys sensualyte by good gouernaunce so that hyt letteth hym noght fro study / And so by hys good besynesse he geteth the frute of al the vii. science. ¶The v. labour vvas vvhen he bound Cerberus the foule hound of helle. Of thes Cerberus the fable ys thys. Pirritous vvold vvedde the quene of helle. And he called Hercules & Theseus / & other myghty men to helpe hym. And vvhē they came to helle / lest Cerberus the por¦ter sholde lette them of ther purpose / Hercules bounde hym vvythe a cheyn of adamant: The quene of helle may vvel be called vvordly vvorshyp / vvych Pirritous desyreth. But he taketh vvyse men to hys counsel. And Cerberns vvyth iii. heddes Hercules byndeth / That ys Pryde / Auaryce / and Lechory. Thes iii. hed synnes letteth a man to be vvorshypful / vvhere for the vertuous man byndeth & restreyneth them vvyth a treble cheyn of vertues. And vvhen that thes vyces be so repressed by vertues / a man may not fayle to be vvorshypful. ¶The vi. labour vvas that he made diomede to be eten of hys avvne hors. The fable ys thys. Diomede kyng of Trace / fedde hys hors vvyth mannes flesshe: vvher fore he vsed to slee hys gestes for hys hors. But at last came Hercules and slvve hym / ▪ And made hys horse to ete hym. And fynally sloo the same hors. Thys Diomede beto∣keneth a vvastour that pylleth and despoyleth the people / for to mayn∣teyn hys grete a ray / vvych passeth the suffysaunce of hys astate. But a vertuous man shal besey hym self for to destroy suche maner leuers / & compelle them for to leue by ther avvne good: But vvhen they may not contynue that a ray vvythoute rauen and robbery / ther hors and ther a ray bryngeth them to noght. so that of nede they must leue hyt and leue as they may. ¶The vii. labour vvas / that he brent the serpent Idra. In the ryuer of Lerne vvas a serpent vvyth
many heddes / And euer yf one vvere cut of / ther vvaxe ii. ther fore. And vvhen that Hercules had shotte hym & no thyng a vayled / at last he made a boute thys serpēt a hugey hepe of vood: & after set hyt a fyre & so brent thys serpent. Thys fable ys toched be fore & in part declared ¶The viii. labour ys of Achilaus. the fable ys thys. Hercules and Achilaus vvressheled to gether for the mayden Dianer / & vvhen that Achilaus feld hym self at the vvorse / he torned hym self sodenly in to a serpēt / & slypte out of hys handes. And Hercules eftsones caught hym & vvas in poynt to vvery hym. And then Achilaus torned hym self in to a bole. So Hercules a none toke hym & threvv hym to the ground & breke hys horne. & he for shame lepte in to the vvater & hyd hym. The truthe of thys fable ys thys Achilaus ys a ryuer be tvvene grece & Calcedoyne. In thys Calcedoyne regned a kyng named Genus / hose doghter Hercules rauesshed. And comyng to thys ryuer vvhē he might not passe hyt he stopped an arme of hyt & dryed hyt / & so he passed vvith hys loue. By thys kynges doghter may be vnderstand vertu / vvyche Hercules the myghty man coueyteth for to haue. Achilaus betokeneth the sensualyte / vvych in youth hyley vvythstandeth a man that vvold be vertuous. But fyrst the sensualyte as a serpent assayleth hym by ma¦ny syde vvayes / And vvhen thys myghty man hath ouercome al tho ser¦pentes deceytes / he torneth in to a bole vvyth ii. hornes / Lechory / & Glotony. But thys one horne of Lechory / the vertuous man breketh & vtterly destroyeth. & then ys the sensualyte ouercome / For the other horne of glotony vvyl lyghtly of a vertuous man be put vnder by good gouernaunce. So thys bole lepeth in to the ryuer. the sensualyte ys re∣pressed & keleth hym self by penance / and so vvynneth the myghty man vertue to hys loue. ¶The ix. labour ys of Antheas the grete geaunt / vvych vvas geten of the erthe / And euer as he toched the erthe / he renued hys strengthe vvyth vvych geaunt Hercules vvrasteled / But alvvay vvhen he semed dyscomfeted / fallyng to ground he became as fresshe as he vvas before Than Hercules perceuyug thys toke hym in hys armes / & leyd hym on hys brest / and so streyned hym to deth by strengthe: & so caste hym to the grounde / & thus destroyed he the geaunt. By thes Antheus may be vnderstand vvordly couetyce / vvych encresseth & renueth hys strēgth by tochyng of the groūd. For couetyce vvyl not be quenched by plenty of vvordly good / but rather ys ther by renued & enforced. Hercules thē the vertuous man / streyneth thys couetyce vvythyn hys brest / & vvyth draeth hyt vtterly fro vvordly good / & so he quencheth the lust that he had ther on / & putteth hyt holely in vertu & in vvysedom. ¶The x. labour ys of Cakus the theffe of Libia vvych Hercules dys∣comfeted & slvve. The fable ys thys. Ther vvas in the mounte Aucentyne a monstre / that spete fyre at hys mouthe / robbyng & despoy¦lyng the people of the contrey. And he vvas the sonne of Vulcane / by vvhom Euander kyng of the land vvas gretly a noyed. And Hercules comyng by that contre / bryngyng vvyth hym out of spayn grete plenty of bestes / thys Cakus stale iiii. bolles & as many keyn: & droe them in
to hys den by the tayles bacvvard / that the stappes sholde not be seyn Invvard. And Hercules by estimation espyed vvhere they vvere / and so droe Cakus out of hys denne / and sloo hym. and so he esed the kyng destroyng hys enemy. ¶The moralyte ys thus. By thys Cakus may be vnderstand pryde. He speteth fyre at hys mouthe / hye vvordes of malyce and manace: He ys Vulcanus sonne. For that vyce ys appro¦pryat to the deuel that fyrst hyt founde. He vvasteth and deuoreth and steleth al that he may / and so harmeth the contre▪ For a proude man vvasteth moche in hys a ray & other expenses / that al that ben a boute hym ben noyed ther by. Euander the reson that ys kyng of the soule may not ouercome hym / for he vvyl not vvorche by hym / He dareth in hys den: syttyng in mannes hert / he steleth iiii. bolles of Hercules he oppresseth the iiii. cardynal vertues / & as many keyn / al other ver∣tues that ben vnder them. For a proude man ys myghtles / vntempe∣rate / vnvvare & vnryghtuous. Thys theffe Hercules that ys consciens espyeth: and draeth out thys theffe pryde out of the hert / and sleyth & destroyth hym / and so hath he hys bestes a geyn / that be vertues. And reson that vvas ouer come / novv regneth in the soule as kyng in pece and reste. ¶The xi. labour ys of the bore that Hercules svve. In archadia vvas a myghty bore that vvasted the regyon sore. vvych Hercules hun¦ted and at last thys bore torned vn to Hercules & smote hym in the shul¦der / and marked hyt vvyth the foom of hys mouthe. By thes bore may be vnderstand the vyce of the flesshe / vvyche vvasteth foule a mā hys substance: Thes vyces Hercules the myghty chaceth and hunteth / in vvyl to destroy them: But thys bore torneth and assayleth Hercu∣les: For hyt chaunceth ofte / that a ful myghty man in vertues: that pursueth & hateth al vyces / ys assayled & repted vvyth the synne of the flesshe / & perauenture ys marked fallyng theryn. But one vycyous dede beryueth not the habyte of vertu: but mah a man more vvare: and dylygent for to kepe hym self / and so at laste he ouercometh hys flesshe and sleyth thys bore of luste and lekyng. ¶The xii. labour vvas thys: after the fable of Duyde. Athlas the myghty geaunt / in the geauntes batayl / fyghtyng a genst the goddes aboue / bare heuen vpon hys shulder: And vvhen that he savve Hercu¦les come to hym / after hys other labours / he vvas vvery of fyghtyng & also of thys burden / prayd hym to helpe hym to bere heuen / And he toke and bare hyt myghtely. vvherby he deserued to be made a fayr sterre in heuen. The truthe vvas thys. Athlas vvas a cheffe astro∣nomer / vvherefore he vvas sayd that he bare heuen / the connynge of heuenly thynges. But vvhen Athlas dyed / vvych deth ys a rest and a refresshyng to the vertuous / Hercules toke heuen vpon hys shulder. The moralyte may be thus. The batayl of geauntes ys the enforsynge of goostly myghtes a genst the goddes a boue / that ys a genst natural inclination to vyces / vvyche ys caused by constella¦tions / But a genst thes inclinations / he may fyght best / that hathe connyng of astronomy. For to serche the myghtes of the planetes for
certen tymes / and knovveth also hovv thes vycious inclinations be∣caused. But at last he must leue the labour of astronomy compelled by age / vvhen al hys passyons ben cessed: and then Hercules taketh heuen vpon hys shulder: and geueth hym holly to heuenly contemplation. And so he deserueth by thys labour specyally to be made a cytesen of he¦uen. ¶Loo thus must euery myghty man that vvyl de seruen heuen. Fyrst lothe and abhorre the monstres of synne: bothe in hym self: and also in other: and at last leuyng al outvvard occupation / geue hym holly to serue god: in prayer and contemplation: and so many he be syker of al that he desyreth. ¶To vvhom so euer the moralyte of thes fables be plefaūt or vnlusty vvere ye vvel that they lacketh al in som thynges lytteral truthe. But a fable lackyng lytteral truthe vnexponed: ys noght elles but a lesyng. And as holy scripture saeth / al that euer doth or speketh lesyng / shal be parteners of the pytte of helle. Vvher fore after my symple connynge / I haue moralysed thē in my maner: leuyng the correction to other that ben clerkes and more connyng in that science.

¶As clerkes haue deffyned / Tyme ys mesure of meuyng of be¦fore & after. Thys mesure ys takē most comēly after the meuyng of the Enoc∣tial vvhos meuyng ys the svvyftest that ys possyble. The vvych lyne ys deuyded in to CCC.lx. euen partes. Of vvyche partes / eueryche ys called a degre. The mesure of a rysyng of xv. degrees / ys called an houre naturel. The mesure of a rysyng of xxiiii. houres / ys a day na∣turel. The mesure of CCC. lxv. dayes & vi. houres of encresse and certen mynutes / ys called a yere. By vvych tymes: the perdurabelte of thys vvorlde of before & after / ys mesured vsyngly. Syth than that mesure of meuyng ys called tyme / then sueth hyt: that before the vvorlde meued / ther vvas no tyme: But god eternally ys / er any thyng meued: or any tyme vvere / and shal be after that al meuynges cesseth: For hys beyng ys mesured by no meuyng of before & after / for hymself ys vnmeueable / ne hys beyng hath no regard to before & after For al tymes present / passed / and to come: ben to hym verely present Ne hys beyng ys not mesured by successyon of tymes. For he hathe hys beyng vnmesured al at ones. vvyche ys called hys eternyte. Ther fore ys god called Inmensus. But the perdurabelte of the vvorlde ys mesured by meuyng of the heuen / vvyche ys called tyme: And len∣ger than heuen meueth / shal ther be no tyme. Than ys hyt so that the beyng of god ys called erernyte. The beyng of thys vvorld ys named perpetuyte. Then ys thys the conceyte of Plato sayng that the vvorlde hath euer ben / That ys to mene / as long as any thynge hathe meued. And as long as any thyng meueth: or any tyme ys / so long hyt shal endure in suche beyng as hyt novv hathe. And after that al meuyng and al tymes cesseth / the vvorlde renued shal endure in lyffe interminable. For so sayth our lorde. Ecce noua facio omnia. ¶Thys interminable lyffe / ys the eternal beyng of our creatour▪ to vvhō as to ther ende / al thyng shal be reduced: and at hym as at ther fynal ende: rest & abyde. Therfore sayth plato as ys in the texte al¦leged / that the vvorlde hathe euer ben: that ys to say: syth any tyme vvas. and hyt shal neuer vvhyle any tyme ys / cessen of hys menynge. So meuyng & tyme shal cessen bothe at ones. And the vvorlde then shal not ende by destruction or torne in to nought / for god and nature dyd neuer thyng in vayn. Ne god noughteth neuer thyng that he made but the corruption of one thyng / ys the generation of a nother thynge. So that at last euery corruptyble thynge retorneth in rounde in to the Elementes / that hyt vvas fyrst formed of. And ther fore the autor sa∣yth / that the entent of temporel thynges that so meuethe in rounde / casteth & entendeth by ledyng of nature / to counterfete the perdurable lyffe of god. For kendly euery creature coueyteth: to conforme hym to hys make / at lest in beyng. vvher fore of nature euery thynge vvyth∣standeth in that hyt may / hys ovvne corruption & diuision of hys par¦tes. And vvhen hyt ys corrupt and resolued in to hys fyrst mater / vvyche ys the elementes / vvych ben cleped the sedes of erthly thynges then ben they apte as they vvere be fore to be mater and to clothe other dyuers formes. And so ben they perpetuate / by ther chaungeabelte in
to an endles compate. For thes thynges yf they fayle in ther indiui∣dues / yet in ther vniuersalles they a bydeth euer: after tyme that they ones be. And the mater of the singulers / torneth into other thynges / after that nature vvorcheth. Than ys thys the conceyt of the clerke in the letter. Euery creature as ys before sayd / coueyteth of na¦ture / for to counterfete hys maker. But for canse thes erthly thyn¦ges of feblenesse and contraryoustey of ther mater / may not endure / but nedes be resolued / ther fore they take that they may of beyng / en∣duryng by successyon of tymes. vvhere that god endureth (not by tem¦poral successyon) but hathe hys beyng separate fro creatures al at ones so that tovvardes hym nought ys to come / ne nought ouer passed / But al that ys / vvas / and shal be: ys be fore hym present. Than hauyng regarde to the eternyte of god / vvyche hath hys beyng al at ones vnmesured by successyon of tymes / ther ys no purueyaunce ne foresyght / but he seyth al by present knovvlege / & in hym / ys none other syght but connyng. For al knovvyng of present and passed / no∣teth imperfection of creatures that be passyng and corruptyble. And hyt nedeth nought / ne ys conuenyent / to conforme hys eternal insyght to oure temporal estimation / that al thyng demeth by before and after as vve haue ouer beynge. But hyt accordeth better / and ys more kendly / that the creature submytte al hys vvytte / and conforme al hys knovvyng holly to hys maker / vvyth oute vvhom he ys nought / can nought / ne hath nought at al / that ought ovveth to be cleped. ¶Syth hyt ys so then that euery Iugement / must sue the nature of the Iuge / that ys of hym that knovveth / hyt nedeth not thē to byn∣den thynges to falle necessaryly / ne to vvete the knovvyng of god for to compelle tho thynges to betyde / be cause that he seyth hyt presently as he al behaldeth / no more than for to vvyte me the meuyng of the sonne / by cause I se hyt meue / or for to vvyte me the deth of a man / by cause I se hym dye. For the meuyng of the sonne ys caused abso¦lutely of the fyrst ordynaunce of hym that made hyt for to meue. But that I novv se hyt meue / hyt procedeth of my ovvne fre vvylle / presupposed that I haue my yees hole & lyberte to se al present obiectes that falleth to my luste. And to an ende hyt shal neuer be brought They say therfore hyt hath eternyte As euen y leke wyth god that hath hyt wrought But yet al one in certeyn ys hyt nought A lyffe interminable for to lede As Plato thought hym self hyt ys no drede ¶Hyt ys a nother to enclosen al
