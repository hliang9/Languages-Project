AN EPITAPH Upon His Late MAJESTY, King CHARLES the II. THE Statue, which the Rhodians say, The Sun Descends on every Day; Is also here in ENGLAND set Within this Royal Cabinet; To whose Eternal Hallowed-Vrn, Pilgrims from Far, shall come and Mourn: Their Snowy-Heads shall Prostrate here, And Drop a Pearly-Aged Tear. TIME, that does make of All his Game, And over all our Hours does Reign; With this Great Treasure now Possest, May set Him down in Peace, and Rest; While We (through Sorrows-Vale) go on, As CAESAR past Great-Rubicon. Thy Actions cannot be Inrol'd, Nor can upon the Brass be told, Nor can be set in Amell'd-Gold, Like Wonders that the Poets tell Of HERO'S that in Marble Dwell; Which like to Rocks that Tempests Scorn, And oft are Angry with the Storm; Must Bow, and yield at TIMES Great Call, And into Flinty-pieces fall: While thy Blest Name shall still Out-live (All the Decay that Age can give) More sweet then those Hydaspes Lends, And the Fam'd-Phoenix e're she Ends: Thy Spirit did (like Elijah) Fall To Bless us at thy FUNERAL. FINIS. Printed for P. Brooksby, at the Golden-Ball, in Pye-Corner: 1685.
