THE COURTIERS Manual Oracle, OR, THE ART OF PRUDENCE. Written Originally in Spanish, By BALTAZAR GRACIAN. And now done into English. LONDON, Printed by M. Flesher, for Abel Swalle, at the Sign of the Ʋnicorn, at the West-End of St. Paul's. 1685.
THE Preface. THe Courtiers Manual Ora∣cle, which is here presented to the Reader, as it is an abridg∣ment of all the works of that judi∣cious and learned Spaniard Baltazar Gracian; so it carries in its own Title an abridgment of it self, as not onely pointing at the subject it treats of, but also the persons for whose use it is designed. Oracles are the glimmerings of a supernatural light, which do rather dazle than illuminate those who are not both attentive, and sharp sigh∣ted: And therefore the Maximes
which here bear that name, are not calculated for all degrees of Men, nor for all sorts of Ʋnderstandings. There is an art of short speaking, no less than that of short hand-wri∣ting, and both are obscure, but to the intelligent and thinking, who may draw considerable advan∣tage from both. It's an old saying; A word's enough to the Wise; and he that cannot crack the shell, and taste the kernel of a sentence, though he may be wise in his own Eyes, will never be reckoned so in the judgment of Sages. A Proverb patly applied and well understood, makes a deeper impression upon the minds of understanding men, than a lank declamation adorned with all the Posies and Flowers of Rheto∣rick. This made the learned and discerning Authour affect a certain vigorous laconicism in all his wri∣tings, that made him highly estee∣med
by the greatest men of his own Countrey, and of Strangers also who understood his language, though the French Authour Des Entretiens d' Ariste & Eugene, a leading Critick accounts him un∣intelligible, and by consequent un∣translateable; but whether he be so or not in this translation, it is left to the judgment of the Reader. It may be made a Probleme, per∣haps, by some, whether The Art of Prudence, be at this time sea∣sonably or not translated and pub∣lished in English; seeing to instruct and not to instruct, has great affinity with the answering and not answering a fool in his folly, according to So∣lomon, and all the World are sa∣tisfied, that there is a vast number of more than ordinary fools, and mad men amongst us at present. The title and design of the Book, I think, may salve the doubt; for
it is the Courtiers Manual Ora∣cle, not of him onely who has the honour to be actually in that station; but of others also, who by knowing, and reflecting upon the transactions of the world, may be capable, if not to serve the Publick, yet to live like men in their generation, and to such it cannot be unseasonable, if they have the ingenuity to act according to its maximes, seeing in so doing they will find by experience, that when once the ground is well known, one may hit the Jack with a Boul that runs streight, if it be their custome to bowl so, as well as with that which fetches the greatest com∣pass by its biass; and that a man may be a Politician successfully, and with applause, without forsa∣king the rational Rules of Morali∣ty and Religion, for the deceitfull Sophistry of Cunning and Artisice, which commonly soon or too late
shews its own perniciousness by the fatal disappointments of those that practise it. For the unintelligent and head-strong Mobile, that makes the greatest part of Mankind, they have nothing to doe with this Book; Odi profanum vulgus & arceo: The Authour wrote not for them, well knowing that their inveterate folly is not to be cured but restrained; and that as it is very easie by force of words and long-winded Cant, to preach them out of their senses, so it is as impossible by short docu∣ments to sentence them into their Wits and good Manners again, as to cure a Chronical Hypochondriarcy by an Aphorism of Hippocrates, or a spell of Seneca's or Plutarch's Morals. To these Animals then for whom the Bit and Bridle is de∣signed, the Discipline of the Whip is the best Doctrine, and nothing of this nature can be seasonable or un∣seasonable,
but as it may influence those of the smaller number, who are their Riders, and spur them at their pleasure; Now if these be so mad as to run upon precipices, and ride over Rocks, those Maximes can in this onely be unseasonable; that they seasonably taught them, what too late, and unseasonably they were convinced of.

THE COURTIERS MANƲAL ORACLE, OR, THE ART of PRUDENCE. MAXIME I. Every thing is now at the point of its per∣fection, and an able Man at the highest pitch thereof. THERE goes more to the making up of one Wise Man now a days, than in Ancient Times of seven: And at present there is more sense requi∣red for treating with one single Person, than heretofore with a whole Nation.
MAXIME II. Wit and a Genius Are two Qualities wherein the Capa∣city of a Man consists. To have one without the other, is to be happy but by halves. It is not enough to have a good understanding, there must be a Ge∣nius also to accompany it. It is com∣monly the ill luck of weak or aukward People to be mistaken in the choice of their Profession, of their Friends, and of the place of their Residence. MAXIME III. Not to be too free, nor open. It is the Admiration of Novelty that makes events to be valued. There is nei∣ther pleasure nor profit in playing ones Game too openly. Not to declare im∣mediately, is the way to hold minds in suspence, especially in matters of impor∣tance, which are the object of universal expectation. That makes every thing to be thought a mystery, and the secret of that raises veneration. In the manner of expression one ought to have a care not to
be too plain: and to speak with open heart is not always convenient in conver∣sation. Silence is the Sanctuary of Pru∣dence. A resolution made manifest was never esteemed. He that declares him∣self, is obnoxious to Censure: and if he succeeds not, he is doubly miserable. We ought then to imitate the method of God Almighty, who always holds men in suspence. MAXIME IV. Knowledge and Valour club to the making of great Men. These are two qualities which render Men immortal, because they themselves are so. No man is great but in so far as he knows: and when he knows, he can doe all things. Man that knows no∣thing, is the World in darkness. Pru∣dence and Strength are his Eyes and Hands. Knowledge is barren, if Valour do'nt accompany it.
MAXIME V. To be always usefull. It is not the Guilder but the Adorer that makes the God. A Man of Parts had rather meet with those who depend upon him, than that are thankfull to him. To keep People in hope, is Civility; to trust to their Gratitude, Simplicity. For it is as common for Gratitude to be for∣getfull, as for Hope to be mindfull. You get always more by this, than by the other. When one hath once drank, he turns his back upon the Well: so soon as the Orange is squeezed, it's thrown upon the ground, When Dependance ceaseth, there's an end of Correspondence, and of Esteem also. It is therefore a lesson of Experience, that a Man ought to endea∣vour always to render himself usefull, nay even to his Prince; though he must not affect an excess of silence, to make others overshoot themselves, nor for his own in∣terest render another man's evil incurable.
MAXIME VI. Man at the height of his perfection. He is not born complete; but dayly improves in his Manners and Employ∣ment, untill at length he arrive at the point of Consummation. Now these are the marks by which we may know an ac∣complished Man: a quaint perception, readiness in discerning, solidity of judg∣ment, tractableness of will, and circum∣spection in words and actions. Some ne∣ver attain to that pitch, there is some∣what always wanting: and others arrive at it, but late. MAXIME VII. To have a care not to outdoe ones Master. All Superiority is odious, but in a Sub∣ject over his Prince, it is ever foolish, or fatal. An accomplished man conceals vul∣gar advantages, as a modest Woman hides her Beauty under a negligent dress. There are many who will yield in good fortune, or in good humour; but no body will yield in Wit, and least of all a Sovereign. Wit is the King of Attributes, and by
consequent, every Offence against it, is no less a Crime than Treason. Sove∣reigns would be witty in all things that are most eminent. Princes are willing to be assisted, but not surpassed. Those who advise them, ought to speak, as if they put them in mind of what they for∣got, and not as teaching them what they knew not. This is a lesson that the Stars reade to us, which though they be the sparkling Children of the Sun, yet never appear in his presence. MAXIME VIII. A Man never taken in passion Is a mark of the sublimest reach of wit, seeing thereby a man puts himself above all vulgar impressions. It is the greatest of Dominions to rule ones self and passions. That is the triumph of free will.) If passion ever seize the mind, let it be without prejudice to our employment, especially if it be conside∣rable. That's the way to prevent much vexation, and to gain a high reputation.
MAXIME IX. To falsifie the defects of ones Nation. Water imbibes the good or bad quali∣ties of the Minerals through which it passes, and Man those of the Climates where he is born. Some are more obli∣ged than others to their Countrey, in that they have met with a more favourable constellation in it. There is no Nation how Polite soever, but hath some origi∣nal failing, which their Neighbours, ei∣ther out of caution or emulation censure. It is the victory of an able man to cor∣rect, or at least bely the censure of these failings. Thereby one acquires the glo∣rious renown of being singular, and that exemption from a common fault is the more esteemed, that no body expects it. There are also Family-defects, defects of Profession, Employment and Age, which concurring all together in one and the same subject, render it an unsupportable Monster, if they be not timely preven∣ted.
MAXIME X. Fortune and Renown. The one is as fickle, as the other firm and constant. The first serves during life, and the other after death. The one resists Envy, and the other Oblivion. For∣tune is courted, and sometimes obtained by the help of Friends. Renown is gai∣ned by Industry. The desire of Reputa∣tion springs from Virtue. Renown hath been and is the Sister of Giants: it is always upon the extremes either of Ap∣plause or Execration. MAXIME XI. To converse with those from whom one may learn. Familiar Conversation ought to be the School of Learning and breeding. A man is to make his Masters of his Friends, seasoning the pleasure of conversing with the profit of instruction. Betwixt Men of Wit the advantage is reciprocal.) They who speak are rewarded with the applause that is given to what they say; and those who hear, with the profit they receive
from it. Our own interest inclines us to conversation. A man of sense frequents the company of good Courtiers, whose Houses are rather the Theatres of He∣roism, than the Palaces of vanity. There are some men who besides their being Oracles themselves, that instruct others by their Example, are also so happy, that their Retinue is an Academy of Prudence and Breeding. MAXIME XII. Nature and Art: Matter and the Artist. There is no Beauty without help, nor perfection that is not apt to fall into bar∣barity, if Art lend not an helping hand. Art corrects what is bad, and perfects what is good. Nature commonly denies us the best, to the end we may have re∣course to Art. The best Nature with∣out Art is but a Wilderness: and how great soever a Man's Talents may be, un∣less they be cultivated, they are but half-talents. Without Art a man knows no∣thing as he ought to do, and is Clownish in every thing he sets about.)
MAXIME XIII. To proceed sometimes cunningly, sometimes candidly. Man's life is a conflict with the malice of man himself. An expert man for Weapons uses the strategems of intention. He never does what he seems to have a mind to doe. He takes an aim, but that is to deceive the Eyes that look upon him. He blurts out a word in the air, and then does a thing that no body dreamt of. If he come out with a saying, it is to amuse the attention of his Rivals, and whilst that is taken up in considering what he drives at, he presently acts what never came into their thoughts. He then, that takes heed not to be imposed upon, pre∣vents the cunning of his Companion by good reflexions. He always understands the contrary of what one would have him to understand, and thereby he im∣mediately discovers the falsifie. He lets the first pass goe, and expects the second or third with a good guard. And when afterwards his Artifice is known, he re∣fines his dissimulation, making use of truth it self to deceive by. To change his cunning, he changes his ground and
battery. His Artifice is to have no more Art, and all his subtilty is to pass from Dissimulation to Candour. He, who ob∣serves it with a piercing Eye, knowing the Arts of his Rival, stands upon his guard, and discovers darkness under a veil of light. He unddles a procedure the more mysterious, that every thing in it is sincere. And thus the wiles of Pytho engage the candour of Apollo. MAXIME XIV. The thing and the manner of the thing. The substance is not enough, unless it be cloathed with its circumstances. An ill way spoils all, it even disfigures Justice and Reason. On the contrary, a grace∣full way supplies all defects, it guilds a denial, sweetens the sharpness that is in truth, and smooths the wrinkles of old age. The How does much in all things. A free and disengaged way charms the minds of men, and makes the complete Ornament of life. This Maxime is taken out of the third Chapter of the Authours Discreet, Del modo y Agrado. And seeing that Chapter is very instructive, the Reader, I hope, will not take it ill to have here an abstract of it.
For this great Precept, says he, Cleo∣bulus got the Reputation of the chief of the Wise Men. And, indeed, it is the chief of Precepts. But if to teach it was sufficient for procuring the name of a Wise Man, nay, and of the chief of the Sages, what remins for him that shall put it in practice? For to know things, and not to practise them, is not to be a Philosopher but a Grammarian. In all things the circumstance is as ne∣cessary as the substance, nay, and more. The thing that first presents to us, is not the essence, but the appearance. By the outside we come to the knowledge of what is within. By the bark of the manner we discern the fruit of the sub∣stance: insomuch that we judge of Per∣sons whom we know not by their deport∣ment. The way and manner is that part of merit which most affects the attention. And seeing it is to be acquired, he that is without it is inexcusable. Truth has force; Reason authority; and Justice power: but they are without luster if the gracefull way be wanting; as with it every thing is set off with more advantage. It makes amends for all things, even for the defects of reason; it guilds slights, paints deformities, hides
imperfections, and in a word, disguises every thing. Great Zeal in a Minister; Valour in a Commander; learning in a Scholar; Pow∣er in a Prince; are not enough, unless these qualities be accompanied with that important formality. But it is in no em∣ployment more necessary, than in Sove∣reign Command. To be humane rather than despotick is in Superiours a singular way to engage. To see a Prince make Superiority yield to Humanity, obliges Subjects upon a double account to love him. He must reign in the first place over the wills of men, and then over the rest. Conciliate to thy self the good will, and even the applause of all men, if not out of inclination, at least by art. For they who admire, mind not whether thy way be natural or adventitious. There are many things which are worth but little in themselves, and yet are esteemed for their manner. By the help of that old things become new, and return into fashion. If the circumstances be of common use, they palliate the un∣couthness of Antiquity. The relish of men advances always, and never recoils. What is past takes not, and nothing but what is new pleases it. Nevertheless, a little change may beguile it. Circumstances
make things grow young again, they cure them of the musty scent, and the mouldiness of Too often, which is always intolerable, and especially in imitations, which can never rise neither to the height, nor Novelty of the Original. This is still more obvious to be seen in the functions of the mind. For though things be very well known, yet they ne∣ver fail to raise the Appetite, if the Ora∣tour and Historian hit upon a new way of saying or writing them. When things are exquisite, they cloy not, though they be even seven times re∣peated. But though they be not tedious, yet they are not admired. And there∣fore it is necessary to season them, other∣wise to the end they may excite atten∣tion. Novelty caresses and charms the Palate. And objects are renewed merely by changing the Ragoe, which is the true art of pleasing. Two men shall say the very same things, and yet the one shall please, and the other by the same means offend. So important it is to know the way how! So usefull is a gracefull manner, and so hurtfull an unseemly! Now if the want of a manner be so remarkable, what must that be which is actually bad, and designedly offensive, and especially in
those that hold a publick Post? Thy Clownish Air is but a small defect, said a Wise Man, and yet it is enough to make all people disgust thee. On the contrary, an external agreeableness promises a suita∣bleness of mind; and beauty vouches for good humour. The gracefull manner so guilds and sets off a No, as to make it more esteemed than an ill seasoned Yea. It so skilfully sugar's over truths, that they pass for blandishments: and sometimes when it seems to flatter, it undeceives, by telling People not what they are, but what they ought to be. MAXIME XV. To make use of Auxiliary-wits. The happiness of great men consists in having witty men about them, who clear them from the difficulties of igno∣rance, by disentangling their affairs. To entertain Wise Men, is a grandeur surpas∣sing the barbarous haughtiness of that same Tigranes, who prided himself in be∣ing served by Kings, whom he had con∣quered. It is a new kind of Dominion to make those our Servants by Art, whom Nature hath made our Masters. Man
has much to know, and but a short while to live; and he lives not at all, if he know nothing at all. It is therefore a singular piece of skill to study without pains, and to learn much, by learning of all. When that is once done, you shall see a man speak in a publick Assem∣bly with the wit of many; or rather, you hear as many Sages speaking by his mouth, as have before instructed him. Thus, the labours of others make him pass for an Oracle, seeing these Sages fit his Lesson for him, and distill into him the quintessence of their knowledge. Af∣ter all, let him who cannot have Wisedom for a Servant, endeavour at least to have it for a Companion. MAXIME XVI. Knowledge and a right intention. Both these together are the source of good successes. A good Understanding with a bad Will, make a monstrous Mar∣riage. An ill intention is the poison of Humane life, and is the more mischie∣vous when backed by knowledge. That's an unlucky Wit which is employed to doe evil. Learning destitute of true judg∣ment is double folly.)
MAXIME XVII. Not to follow always one and the same Conduct. It is good to vary, that you may fru∣strate the Curiosity, especially of those who envy you. For if they come to ob∣serve an uniformity in your actions, they will prevent your enterprizes, and by con∣sequent make them miscarry.) It is easie to shoot a Fowl that flies out-right, but not a Bird which is irregular in its flight. Yet it is not good to be always upon the intrigue neither; for at second bound the cunning will be discovered. Jealousie is upon the watch; there is much skill re∣quired to guard against it. (A cunning Gamester never plays the Card which his Adversary expects, and far less that which he desires.) MAXIME XVIII. Application and Genius. No body can be eminent without both these. When those two parts concur, they make a great man. An ordinary Wit that applies it self, goes farther than a sublime
mind without application. Reputation is got by indefatigable labour. What costs but little, is good for nothing. Some have wanted application even in the highest employments; so rare a thing it is to force ones Genius. To have rather be indifferent in a sublime employment, than excellent in an indifferent, is a desire rendred excusable by Generosity. But he is not to be pardoned who rests satis∣fied to be indifferent good in a small em∣ployment, when he might excell in a great. One must have Art and a Ge∣nius then, which he is to complete by ap∣plication. MAXIME XIX. Not to be too much blazed abroad by the noise of Fame. It is the usual misfortune of every thing that hath been much talked of, always to come short of the perfection that men have imagined to themselves.) Reality can never equal imagination, seeing it is as difficult to have all perfections, as it is easie to entertain a notion of them. Since desire is the Husband of imagination, it always conceives much more of things than they are in effect. How great soe∣ver
perfections may be, they never match the Idea of them. And as men find themselves frustrated of their expectation, so they undeceive themselves in stead of admiring. Hope always lessens the truth. And therefore Prudence ought to correct it, by qualifying it so, that the enjoy∣ment may surpass the desire. Some be∣ginnings of Credit serve to awaken the Curiosity, but not to endear the object of it. It is most honourable when the effect exceeds the notion and expectation. This rule holds not good in evil, wherein exaggeration serves to belie, calumnie, and detraction with the greater applause, by making that appear tolerable which was thought to be abominable. MAXIME XX. Every man in his time. People of extraordinary and eminent merit depend on the Times. All have not had the Age they deserved, and ma∣ny who have met with that, have not had the happiness to make the best of it. Others have been worthy of a better Age; which is an argument, that every thing that is good, does not always tri∣umph. Things of this world have their
seasons, and that which is most eminent, is obnoxious to the freakishness of Cu∣stome. But it is always the comfort of a Wise Man, that he is Eternal. For if his own age be ungreatefull to him, those that come after doe him Justice. MAXIME XXI. The Art of being happy. There are rules of good Fortune; and Happiness in regard of a Wise Man is not always fortuitous. His industry can help it forwards. Some think it enough to stand at the Gate of Fortune in a good posture, and expect till she open it. Others doe better, and trusting to their confidence or merit advance farther on, so that by cajo∣ling of Fortune, soon or late they gain her. However, according to right Philosophy, vertue and application are the onely Ar∣biters of a man's lot. For as imprudence is the source of all the crosses of life, so Prudence is the cause of all its happiness. MAXIME XXII. The Man that takes. A gentile Education is the portion of
Men of Breeding. The knowledge of the Affairs of the Time, good sayings spoken to purpose, pleasant ways of do∣ing things, make the man of fashion: and the more he excells in these things, the less he holds of the vulgar. Sometimes a sign or gesture makes deeper impression than all the documents of a severe Master. The art of conversing hath stood in grea∣ter stead to some, than the seven liberal Arts all together. MAXIME XXIII. To have no blemish. There is no perfection without an If, or a But. There are but very few that want faults, either in manners or body. But there are a great many who are vain of the faults, which it would be easie for them to amend. When we see the smal∣lest defect in an accomplished man, we say it's pity, because one Cloud is enough to eclipse all the Sun. These defects are blemishes at which envy levels. It would be a notable piece of skill to change them into persections, as Julius Caesar did, who being bald, covered that defect under the shadow of his Laurels.
MAXIME XXIV. To moderate ones own imagination. The true means of living happy, and of being always esteemed Wise, is either to correct it, or confine it. Otherwise it takes a Tyrannical Empire over us, and transgressing the limits of speculation, be∣comes so very absolute, that life is happy, or miserable, according to the different fancies that it imprints upon us. For to some it represents nothing but pains and trouble, and through their folly becomes their Domestick Executioner. Others there are again, to whom it proposes one∣ly pleasures and grandeurs, delighting to divert them in dreams. And these are the effects of imagination, when not curb'd by reason. MAXIME XXV. A good Pryer. To understand the art of reasoning and discourse, was heretofore the Science of Sciences: but that alone will not doe now a-days, we must guess and divine, and especially if we would undeceive our
selves. He that is not a good Pryer can never be a good Judge. There are Spies over the heart and intentions. The truths which import us most, are never told us but by halves. A man of Wit must dive into the meaning of them, checking his credulity in what appears advantageous, and giving the reins to believe as to that which is odious! MAXIME XXVI. To find out the weak side of every one. That is the art of managing humours, and of gaining our ends upon men. It depends more upon skill than resolution to know how to win upon the minds of People. There is no will that hath not its predominant passion, and these passions are different according to the diversity of tempers. All men are Idolaters: some of honour, others of interest, and most part of their pleasures. The skill is then, to know aright these Idols, if we would hit the weak side of those who adore them. He that can doe so, has the key of ano∣ther man's will.) We must move with the first mover; and that is not always the higher, but most commonly the lower fa∣culty. For in this world the number of those
who are irregular, is far greater than of those who are not. (We are first to know the Character of the Person, next feel his Pulse, and then attack him by his stron∣gest passion, which is his weaker side. That is a sure way to gain the Party.) MAXIME XXVII. To prefer intention before extention. Perfection consists not in quantity, but in quality. Of all that is very good, there is always but very little. That whereof there is much, is little esteemed. And even amongst men Giants pass common∣ly for real Dwarfs, (some value Books for their bulk, as if they were made rather to load the Arms than to exercise the mind.) Extention alone could never ex∣ceed mediocrity. And it is the unhappiness of men that offer at every thing, to excell in nothing, because they would excell in all. Intention gives an eminent rank, and makes a Heroe, if the matter be sublime. MAXIME XXVIII. To have nothing that's vulgar. He was a man of an excellent discer∣ning,
whom it displeased to please many: Wise Men are never fond of vulgar Ap∣plause. There are Camelions of so po∣pular a palate, that they take more plea∣sure to suck in a gross air, than to smell the sweet Zephyres of Apollo. Be not dazled at the sight of the miracles of the vulgar. Ignorants are always in a maze. That which makes the folly of the mo∣bile admire, undeceives the discerning of the Wise. MAXIME. XXIX. The upright Man. One ought always to be on the side of Reason, and that so constantly, that nei∣ther vulgar passion, nor any tyrannical violence may be able to make him aban∣don the party. But where is that Phoe∣nix of equity to be found? Sure, she has not many Adherents. There are many who publish her praises, but will not admit her into their Houses. Others follow her as far as danger will permit; but when they come to that, some like salse Friends deny her; and the rest, like Politicians, pretend they know her not. She, on the contrary, scruples not to fall out with Friends, with Powers, nay, and
with her own interest: and there lies the danger of mistaking her. The cunning stand neuter, and by a plausible and me∣taphysical subtilty, endeavour to recon∣cile their Conscience with reason of state. But an upright man looks upon that way of trimming as a kind of Treason, think∣ing it more honour to be constant, than to be a Statesman. He is always where truth is: and if he sometimes leave peo∣ple, it is not that he is fickle, but because they have first forsaken reason. MAXIME XXX. Not to affect extraordinary, nor yet Chi∣merical Employments. That affectation serves onely to attract contempt. Whimsey hath hatched ma∣ny Sects: but a Wise Man ought to e∣spouse none of them. There are some strange palates, that like nothing of what others love. Every thing that is singu∣lar pleases them. It is true, that makes them to be taken notice of, but rather to be laughed at than esteemed. Nay, (those who would be wise, ought to have a spe∣cial care not to affect to be so.) Upon far better ground ought they, who are of a profession, that renders the professours ri∣diculous.
We name not here the Em∣ployments, seeing the contempt that eve∣ry one has of them, makes them suffici∣ently known. MAXIME XXXI. To know happy People, to make use of them, and the unhappy to avoid them. Misfortune commonly is an effect of folly: and there is not a more dangerous contagion than that of the unfortunate. We must not open the door to the least evil, for others, and those greater too, which lie in ambush come always after. The true skill at play, is to know how to discard. The lowest Card that turns up, is better than the highest of the for∣mer dealing. In doubts, there is no bet∣ter expedient than to consult the wise: soon or late that will answer our expecta∣tion. MAXIME XXXII. To have the reputation of contenting every body. That gives Credit to those who Go∣vern. By that means Sovereigns gain
the good will of the publick. The onely advantage they have, is, that they can doe more good than other men. Those are the truest Friends who are made by reiterated Amities. But there are some of a humour of contenting no body, not so much because that would be chargeable to them, as that their Nature is averse from shewing kindness. In all things contrary to Divine Bounty, which com∣municates it self incessantly. MAXIME XXXIII. To know how to be a denied Man. If it be a great art to know how to re∣fuse favours, it is a far greater to be able to deny ones self in business and visits. There are some troublesome employments that corrode the most pretious time. It is bet∣ter to doe nothing at all, than to be busie to no purpose. It is not enough to be a prudent man, to make no intrigues, but he must also avoid to meddle in them. We must not be so much at the devotion of others, as not to be more at our own. We are not to abuse Friends, nor to re∣quire more of them than they are willing to grant. Every thing that is excessive is vitious, especially in conversation: and
without that moderation there is no pre∣serving of the good will and esteem of o∣thers, on which Civil Decency depends. One should use all his liberty in chusing what is most excellent, but so, as he ne∣ver offend against judgment and discretion. MAXIME XXXIV. To know ones own strength. That knowledge serves to cultivate the excellent and improve common endow∣ments. Many would have become great men, had they known their true Talent. Strive then to know thine own, and join to it application. In some judgment has the advantage, and in others courage: most part lay a constraint upon their Ge∣nius: whence it is that they never excell in any thing. One is late in forsaking what passion made him early espouse. MAXIME XXXV. To weigh things according to their just value. It is the onely ruine of Fools, that they never consider. Seeing they do not com∣prehend things, they neither see the da∣mage,
nor profit, and by consequent trou∣ble themselves not about them. Some set a great value upon that which is but of little worth, because they take all things the backward way. Many for want of sense, feel not their distemper. There are some things on which one can∣not think too much. The wise man re∣flects on all, but not on all alike. For he dives where there is any ground, and sometimes he thinks there is more in the thing than he thinks of: So that his re∣flexion goes as far as his apprehension went. MAXIME XXXVI. Not to engage in any enterprise before one hath examined his own fortune and a∣bility. This experience is far more necessary than the knowledge of our constitution. If it be the mark of a Fool to begin at forty years of age, to consult Hipocra∣tes about his health: He is a far greater Fool, who begins at that age, to go to the School of Seneca, to learn how to live. It is no small point to know how to govern ones fortune, whether it be in waiting till she be in the good humour:
(for she loves to be waited on) or in ta∣king her such as she offers. For she hath an ebbing and flowing, and it is impossi∣ble to fix her, being so irregular and va∣riable as she is. Let him who hath often found her favourable, not desist from im∣portuning her, because it is usual with her to declare for the bold, and being courtly, to love the young. Let him who is unhappy withdraw, that he may not meet with the affront of a double re∣pulse, in presence of a happy rival. MAXIME XXXVII. To guess at the meaning of the little hints that are given us by the bye, and to know how to make the best of them. This is the delicatest part in humane conversation; it is the finest probe of the recesses of the heart of man. There are some malitious and angry jirks dipt in the gall of passion: and these are impercepti∣ble Thunder-bolts, that strike down those whom they smite. Many times a word hath thrown down headlong from the pinacle of favour, those whom the mur∣murings of a whole people combined against them could not so much as shake. There are other words or hints which
produce an effect quite contrary, that's to say, which support and encrease the reputation of those to whom they are ad∣dressed. But seeing they are cunningly glanced, so also are they to be cautiously received. For the security consists in smelling out the intention, and the blow foreseen is always warded. MAXIME XXXVIII. To be moderate in good fortune Is the part of a good Gamester, when Reputation lies at stake. A brave Retreat is as great as a brave Enterprise. When one hath acted great exploits, he ought to secure the glory of them, by drawing off in time. A continued Prosperity is always suspected. That which hath its interruptions is the surer. A little sharp with the sweet makes it relish better. The more Prosperities crowd one upon another, the more slippery they are, and subject to a reverse. The quality of the pleasure makes sometimes amends for the shortness of the enjoyment. Fortune is weary to carry one and the same man al∣ways upon her shoulders.
MAXIME XXXIX. To know the nature and season of things, and to be able to make use of them. The works of Nature commonly at∣tain to the point of their perfection. They encrease always by degrees, untill they arrive at it; and so soon as they are come to that, decline again as fast. On the contrary, the works of art are never so perfect, but that they still may be more. It is the sign of a quaint discerning to observe what is excellent in every thing: but few are capable of that, and those who may, do not always doe it. There is a point of maturity even in the fruits of the mind: and it is good to know that point, that we may make our best of it. MAXIME XL. To gain the love of all. It is much to be admired, but it is far more to be beloved. The fortunate Pla∣net contributes somewhat to that, but Industry all the rest. This perfects what the other did but begin. An eminent
merit is not enough, though, in reality, it be easie to gain the affection, when one hath once gained the esteem. He that would be beloved, must love, be benefi∣cent, give good words, and still shew better effects. Courtesie is the politick magick of great Persons. One must first set his hand to great affairs, and then open it liberally to good Pens: alternately em∣ploy the Sword and the Paper. For the favour of Writers who perpetuate great Exploits is to be courted. MAXIME XLI. Never to Exaggerate. Never to speak in Superlatives, is a sign of a Wise Man. For that way of spea∣king always wounds either Truth or Pru∣dence. Exaggerations are so many prosti∣tutions of Reputation, in that they disco∣ver the weakness of understanding, and the bad discerning of him that speaks. Excessive Praises excite Curiosity, and in∣cite to Envy. So that if merit answer not the value that is set upon it, as it commonly happens; general opinion re∣volts against the imposture, and makes the flatterer and flattered both ridiculous. And therefore a prudent man proceeds
with a close rein, and chuses rather to offend by giving too little, than too much. Excellence is rare, and by consequent the value of it is to be well weighed. Exag∣geration is a kind of lying: by Exagge∣ration one gets himself the reputation of a man of bad discerning, and which is worse, of little judgment. MAXIME XLII. Of the Ascendant. This is a certain unaccountable force of Superiority that springs from the Nature, and not from the Artifice, nor affectation of him that has it. Every one submits thereto without knowing how, unless it be that one yields to the insinuating pow∣er of the natural authority of another. These Paramount Genies are Kings by merit, and Lions by a privilege that is born with them. They command the Heart and Tongues of others by a secret Charm, that makes them be respected. When such men have the other requisite qualities, they are cut out for the chief movers of the Government Politick, in respect they can doe more with a hint, than others with all their efforts and rea∣sons.
This Empire, saith the Authour, in the Chapter Del senorio en el dezir, &c. is skotched out by nature, and finished by art. All who have that advantage, find things ready done to their hands. Nay, Superiority it self facilitates all things to them, insomuch that nothing puzles them, but in every thing they come off with Honour. Their sayings and acti∣ons seem as great again as they are. An ordinary thing hath even appeared ex∣cellent, when seconded by that Empire. They who want that Superiority, enter diffidently upon affairs: which takes from them much of their gracefulness, especially if it be observed. From diffi∣dence immediately springs fear, which shamefully banishes assurance; and by consequent action and reason loose all their lustre. That fear so absolutely Ty∣rannizes over the mind, that it deprives it of all liberty. Insomuch that reason is at a stand, words are frozen, and activi∣ty remains under an interdict. The Ascendant of him that speaks, gains him at first the respect of him who hears. It makes the greatest Critick give attention, and Sovereignly sways the consent of a whole Company. It furni∣shes expressions, nay, and sentences to the person that speaks: whereas fear
choaks the words. Timidity is sufficient to chill reasoning: and though it could overflow with a Torrent of Eloquence, yet the great cold of fear will put a stop to its course. He that with Native Authority enters into Conversation, has respect at his De∣votion before hand: But he who comes to it with fear, accuses himself of weak∣ness, and confesses he is overcome: for which diffidence of mind he is despised, or at best not much esteemed of others. The truth is, a wise man ought to be re∣served, and particularly when he is not acquainted with his company. He first tries the foard, but especially if he fore∣see that it is deep. Though it be both Civility and Duty to qualifie this imperious boldness, in spea∣king to Princes and great men; yet one must have a care of falling into the ex∣tremity of discomposing bashfulness. There it is that a man ought to keep a mean betwixt boldness and confusion, that he may neither be disagreeable nor ridiculous. Let neither thy fear be so great, as to make thee lose assurance; nor thy boldness so sawcy, as to forget respect. That Superiority glisters in all sorts of people, but much more in great men. In
an Oratour it is more than one circum∣stance: It's essential to a Lawyer; In an Ambassadour it is a glorious Quality; and a victorious Attribute in a Comman∣der: but in a Prince it is the Ornament of perfection. It raises the price of all hu∣mane actions; and reaches even the coun∣tenance, which is the throne of comeli∣ness; and the gate also in such a manner, that the steps of a man are the signatures of the character of his heart; and judi∣cious persons delineate theirs by a noble way of acting and speaking. For sublime actions are of double value, when they are accompanied with majesty. Some are born with an universal power in all that they say and doe. One would say that nature had made them the elder brothers of mankind. They are designed to be Superiours in all things, if not in Dignity, at least in Merit. A spirit of Dominion exerts it self in them, even in their most common actions. All obey them, because in every thing they excell. They rob the hearts, and so at first be∣come the masters of others; for their ca∣pacity is large enough for all things. And though there may be others sometimes that have more learning, nobility, nay, and vrtue; yet still they get the better on't by an Ascendant, that gives them the
Superiority; so that if they be not in the right, yet at least they make good their title by possession. MAXIME XLIII. To speak with the Vulgar, but to think with the Wise. To go against the stream, is a thing wherein it is as impossible to succeed, as it is easie to be exposed to danger. Socra∣tes was the onely man that could under∣take it. Contradiction passes for an af∣front, because it is a condemning of the Judgment of another. Malecontents multiply, sometimes because of the thing that is censured; and sometimes because of the Party that it had. Truth is known but of a very few, and false Opinions go current with the rest of the world. One must not judge of a wise man by what he says, seeing sometimes he speaks at second hand, that's to say, ac∣cording to the common voice, though his judgment give the lie to the vulgar errour. A wise man shuns as much to be contra∣dicted, as to contradict. The more his judgment enclines him to censure, the more he has a care not to publish it. O∣pinion is free; it neither can nor ought to
be forced. The wise man retires within the Sanctuary of his silence, and if some∣times he be communicative, it is but to a few, and those the Wise. MAXIME XLIV. To sympathize with great men. It is the quality of a Heroe to love a Heroe; it is a secret instinct that nature bestows upon those whom she intends to conduct to Heroism. There is a kind∣red of hearts and inclinations, and the effects of it are by the vulgar attributed to enchantment. That sympathy rests not at esteem, it proceeds to good will, and at length arrives at affection: it per∣suades without speaking, and obtains without recommendation. There is an active and a passive, and the more sublime, the more happy they are. The skill lies in knowing, distinguishing, and under∣standing how to make the best use of them. Without that inclination the rest is good for nothing.
MAXIME XLV. To use Reflexion without abusing it. Reflexion ought neither to be affected nor known. Artifice is to be hid, in as much as it is suspicious, and all caution more, because it is odious. If Cheating be in vogue; double your vigilance, but with∣out making it known, lest that make people distrustfull. Suspicion provokes to revenge, and sets men upon thoughts of doing the hurt, that they never thought on before. Reflexion upon the state of affairs, is a great help in acting. There is not a better proof of a man of sense, than to be reflexive. The greatest per∣fection of actions depends on the full knowledge with which they have been executed. MAXIME XLVI. To correct ones Antipathy. It is our custome to hate right or wrong, that's to say, even before we know what he is, whom we hat: and sometimes that vulgar aversion, has the boldness to attack great persons. Prudence
ought to keep it under. For nothing dis∣credits us more, than to hate those who deserve to be beloved. As it is noble to sympathize with Heroes, so is it disgrace∣full to have antipathy against them. MAXIME XLVII. To shun Engagements Is one of the chief Maximes of Pru∣dence. In large places there is always great distance from one end to the other. It is the same in great affairs. We must jog on a good way before we come to see the end of them. And therefore the wise engage not willingly therein. They come to a rupture as late as possibly they can, seeing it is easier to wave the occa∣sion, than to get off, if engaged with honour. There are temptations of judg∣ment, which it is safer to avoid, than to overcome. One Engagement draws a greater after it, and commonly there is a precipice hard by. Some men naturally, and sometimes through a national fault, meddle in every thing, and engage incon∣siderately. But he that takes reason for his Guide, proceeds always with circum∣spection. He finds greater advantage in not engaging, than in overcoming: and
though some rash blockhead may be rea∣dy to begin, yet he has a care not to make a second. MAXIME XLVIII. The man of a good Stock. The more depth one hath, the more man he is. The inside ought to be worth as much again as what appears outwardly. Some men have no more but a front, just like Houses, which for want of a good foundation, have not been finished. The entry speaks the Palace, and the Cottage the Lodging. These men have nothing that one can fix upon, or rather every thing is fixed with them. For after the first salutation the conversation is at an end. They make their complement of entry, as the Sicilian Horses their Cara∣cols, and then all of a sudden are dumb. For words are soon drained when the Un∣derstanding is shallow. It is easie for them to deceive others, who like them∣selves have nothing but a shew; but they are fops to men of discerning, who pre∣sently discover that they are empty with∣in.
MAXIME XLIX. The judicious and penetrating man Masters objects, and is never mastered by them. He presently sounds the bot∣tom of the profoundest depth. He knows very well how to make the Anatomy of mens capacities. Let him but look upon a man, and he'll dive into the depth of him, and know him throughly. He de∣ciphers all the secrets of the closest heart. He is quick in conceiving, severe in cen∣suring, and judicious in drawing his con∣sequences. He discovers all, observes all, and comprehends all. That and the preceding Maxime have their Commentary in the Authours Discreet, ch. Hombre Juizioso y notante, where thus he speaks. Momus reasoned but very dully, when he would have had a little Window to be made in the heart of Man. It would be of very little use to some men, who look through perspective glasses. A good judgment is the principal key of another man's heart. It is to no purpose for ig∣norance to retreat into the Sanctuary of silence, and Hypocrisie into a whited Se∣pulchre, a judicious man discovers all,
guesses at all, and penetrates into all. He at first distinguishes appearance from reality. He looks into the inside, and rests not on the vulgar surface. He de∣ciphers the intentions and ends; for the key of Criticizing is in his possession. Seldom hath deceit, and far less ignorance bragg'd of being too hard for him. That pre-eminence hath rendred Tacitus so fa∣mous in the particular, and Seneca so esteemed in the common. There is no quality more opposite to vulgar ignorance than this: it is sufficient alone to gain a man the reputation of discreet. The vulgar hath always been malitious, but never judicious: And though it says any thing, yet it understands not every thing. It seldom distinguishes truth from pro∣bability. Seeing it never bites but the bark, it swallows down all, without nau∣seating a lie. And about two pages after. A yea from those judges of merit and ca∣pacity, is worth more than all the accla∣mations of a people. And it was not without ground, that Plato called Aristo∣tle his whole School; and Antigonus the Philosopher Zeno, the whole sum of his Renown. But it is to be observed that there is great difference betwixt censure and backbiting For the one is grounded upon indifference, and the other upon
malice. Our Aphorism enjoins not a dis∣creet man to be satyrical, but to be in∣telligent: it prescribes not the condem∣ning of every thing, which would be an insupportable extravagance of mind; but far less the approving all things, which is the silliest piece of Pedantry. MAXIME L. Never to lose the respect which is due to ones self. One ought to be such, as to have no cause of blushing in private. His own Conscience ought to be a sufficient rule of his Actions. A good man is more ob∣liged to his own severity, than to all Pre∣cepts. He refrains to doe what is indiffe∣rent, for fear of wounding his own mo∣desty, rather than offending against the Authority of his Superiours. When one stands in awe of himself, he stands in no need of Seneca's imaginary Tutor. MAXIME LI. The man of a good choice. A good choice supposes a good discer∣ning and good sense. Wit and Study are
not sufficient to make a happy life. There is no perfection, where there is nothing to be chosen. To be able to chuse, and to chuse well, are the two advantages of a good dis∣cerning. Many who have a pregnant and fertile wit, a strong judgment, and much knowledge acquired by study, are at a loss when they are to make a choice: it is fatal to them to hit upon the worst, and one would say, that they loved to deceive them∣selves. It is then one of the greatest gifts of Heaven, to be a man of a good choice. MAXIME LII. Never to be disordered. It is a great point always to be master of ones self. A man thereby becomes excellent, and has the heart of a King, seeing it is very difficult to shake a great Soul. Passions are the Elementary hu∣mours of the mind: so soon as these hu∣mours exceed, the mind becomes sick; and if the distemper rise to the mouth, Reputation is much in danger. One ought therefore so to get the mastery over himself, that he may never be accused of transport, neither in the height of pro∣sperity, nor in the worst of adversity; but on the contrary make himself be ad∣mired as invincible.
MAXIME LIII. Diligent and intelligent. Diligence executes speedily what intel∣ligence projects slowly. Precipitancy is the passion of fools, who not being able to discover the danger, act at hap-hazard. On the contrary, the wise trespass in slow∣ness, the common effect of reflexion. Sometimes delay makes a well concerted enterprise to miscarry. Speedy execution is the mother of good Fortune. He hath done much, who hath left nothing to be done till to morrow. It's a saying wor∣thy of Augustus: Festina lentè, make haste slowly. MAXIME LIV. To be a man of metal. When the Lion is dead, the Beasts are not afraid. Brave men are not to be jea∣sted with. If one resist not the first time, he'll far less resist the second, and it grows still worse and worse. For the same difficulty that in the beginning might have been surmounted, is greater in the end. The vigour of mind surpasses that
of the body, it must always be in a rea∣diness, as well as the Sword, to be made use of when occasion serves. By that means we gain respect. Many men have had eminent qualities, who for want of a good heart, have been looked upon as dead, seeing they have been buried alive in the obscurity of contempt. It is not without reason that Nature hath given Bees both honey and a sting, and the body of man also both nerves and bones. The mind then, must also have some mix∣ture of sweetness and resolution. MAXIME LV. The man that can wait with patience. Never to be too forward nor passionate, is the sign of a free and unconfined heart. He that is master of himself, will soon be of others. We must traverse the large carriere of time, before we come to the centre of occasion. A rational tempori∣zing ripens secrets and resolutions. The crutch of time does more business than the Club of Hercules. God himself when he punishes us, makes not use of the rod, but of the season. It was a good saying of Philip the second of Spain: Time and I are good enough for other two. Nay,
Fortune rewards with interest those who have the patience to wait for her. The Authour in the third Chapter of his Discreet, having given an allegorical de∣scription of the triumphant Chariot of Expectation, drawn by Remora's, and of her Throne made of the shell of a Tor∣toise; and having told, how that Chariot was on a day attacked by a Squadron of Monsters, which were blind passion, un∣discreet engagement, imprudent haste, fool-hardiness, inconsideration, precipita∣tion and confusion: Expectation, says he, knowing the greatness of the danger, commanded Retention to make hault; and Dissimulation to amuse the Enemies, whilst she should consult what was best to be done. The wise Bias, chief Servant to that great Mistress of her self, advised her to imitate Jupiter, whose Thunderbolts would have already been all spent, if he had not had patience. Louis XI. King of France, was of the Opinion that she should dissemble as he had done, who ne∣ver taught his Son any other Grammar, nor other Politicks. Don John II. King of Aragon, represented to her, that till then the Spanish delaying had wrought more than the French haste. The great Augustus recommended above all things,
and instead of all, his Festina Lenté. The Catholick King Don Ferdinand, as a Prince of Politicks, wherein expectation is well versed, spake more largely. One must, said he, be master of ones self, and then he'll quickly be of others. Tem∣porizing seasons resolutions, and ripens secrets: whereas precipitation always be∣gets untimely births that never attain to the life of immortality. One must think leisurely, and execute speedily. All dili∣gence that is not directed by staidness runs great risk. Things escape from it, as easily as they fall in its way: and some∣times the resounding of the fall is the first signal of their being laid hold on. Expectation is the fruit of great hearts; and abounds in good successes. Men of little courage can neither keep time nor secrets. And then he concludes with that Catalan Oracle: God makes not use of the rod but of the season. MAXIME LVI. To find out good expedients. Is the effect of a happy quickness which is no more puzled at any thing, than as if nothing happened fortuitously: Some after long plodding, are still mista∣ken
in every thing; and others hit upon expedients for all things, without think∣ing on them before. There are characters of Antiperistasis, that never succeed bet∣ter than in a plunge. These are Prodi∣gies that doe every thing well upon the spot, and all things ill which they have premeditated. What they hit not upon at first, they never hit upon. Such peo∣ple have great Reputation, because by the quickness of their thoughts, and the suc∣cess of their enterprises, men judge their capacity to be Prodigious. Promptitude, saith the Authour, in his Discreet, Chap. Tener buevos repentes, is the Mother of good Fortune. Unpreme∣ditated hits proceed always from a high∣flown mind. And some lines after. If esteem be due to all that is pertinently done or said, a pat expedient found out at the nick, deserves applause. Readiness and success give a double value to things. Some think much, and nevertheless still fail; and others succeed in all things, without thinking on them before. The quickness of wit supplies the defect of a deep judgment. What offers at first an∣ticipates consultation. There is nothing casual for such men, inasmuch as the pre∣sence of mind stands them in stead of forecast. Extemporaries are the gentile
feats of a good discerning, and the load∣stone of admiration. Ordinary actions unpremeditated, make a greater shew than high designs that have been concer∣ted. And a page after. One single ex∣temporary hit was enough to procure Solomon the renown of being the wisest of men. By one word he rendred him∣self more redoubtable, than by all his power. Alexander and Caesar deserved to be the elder Sons of Fame, the one by be∣thinking himself to cut the Gordian Knot; and the other by saying when he fell, It is a good sign that Africa is under me. Two Extemporaries were as good to both, as the Conquest of two parts of the world. That essay gave a specimen, if they were capable of ruling the Universe. If a sudden repartee hath always been plausible, a prompt resolution deserves well to be applauded. A happy promp∣titude in the effects, shews an eminent activity in the cause. Promptitude in conceiving, is a sign of subtilty, and a readiness in finding out good expedients, is a proof of Wisedom so much the more to be esteemed, that there is a great di∣stance betwixt vivacity and prudence, and betwixt wit and judgment. It is a perfection no less necessary than sublime in Generals of Armies, and brave
men, inasmuch as their actions and exe∣cutions are for most part all sudden and transitory, by reason of the many fortui∣tous cases that have neither been foreseen, nor consulted; and so must be ordered ac∣cording as occasion offers: wherein con∣sists the triumph of their presence of mind, and by consequent the whole assurance of their Victories. But it becomes Kings better to think, because all their actions are eternal. They are to consider for many, and consequent∣ly have need of much Auxiliary Prudence, that they may secure the publick repose. They have time, and their Beds, where they let their resolutions ripen. They spend whole nights in thinking, that they may spend the days in safety. In a word, they labour more with the head than with the hands. And in the third Chapter of a Heroe. He thus speaks. The sayings of Alexander are the Flamboes of his deeds. Caesar was equal∣ly prompt in thinking and in acting. The promptitude of the mind is as happy as that of the will is dangerous. It furnishes wings for soaring to the height of gran∣deur. With these wings many have raised themselves from the centre of obscurity to the orb of the Sun.
If subtilty reign not, it deserves, at least to accompany those who reign. The ordinary sayings of a King are Crowned points of Wit. The treasures of Princes often fail; but their witty sayings are everlastingly preserved in the repository of Fame. Brave men have gone farther sometimes with one word, than with the force of their Arms, Victory being the ordinary reward of a shot of wit. The King of Sages, and the wisest of Kings, acquired that reputation by the ready ex∣pedient, which he found out in the grea∣test of all differences, which was to plead for an Infant. And this shews that wit is usefull to give credit to Justice. MAXIME LVII. The surest men are men of Reflexion. What is well, comes always in good time. What is incontinently done, is as soon undone. That which is to last to eternity, ought to be an eternity a ma∣king. Perfection is the onely thing that is minded, and nothing lasts but what is perfect. All that proceeds from a pro∣found Understanding, endures for ever. What is worth much costs much. The most pretious Metal is the latest in
coming to perfection, and the heaviest. Soon enough, if well enough, said a Wise Man. We examine not how long one has been a doing of a work, but if it be well done. That onely makes it va∣luable. Fast and slow, are accidents which are unknown or forgotten: whereas Well is permanent. What is done in a trice, will be undone all of a sudden. It soon ends, because it was soon finished. The more the Children of Saturn come before the time, the faster he devours them. That which is to last for eternity, ought to be an eternity in coming. Gratian in his Discreet, Chap. Tener buevos repentes. Apelles said to a Painter, who bragg'd that he spent but little time in making his Pictures: That is easily believed, be∣cause it is seen. The famous Michael Angelo, who was very long about his Works, said, that in arts haste was good for nothing, and that as Nature takes much time in forming Animals, that are to last long: so Art that strives to imitate Nature, ought to work leisurely, it being impossible for man to doe any thing that is excellent in haste.
MAXIME LVIII. To shape ones self according to people. One must not strive to shew his parts alike with all people, nor employ greater force than the occasion requires. There must be no profusion neither of know∣ledge nor power. The skilfull Fowler throws no more meat to the Birds than what is necessary to catch them. Have a special care not to make ostentation of every thing, for you'll soon come to want admirers. Some new thing is to be kept in store, that we may appear with to mor∣row: every day a fresh proof, is the way still to keep in credit, and to be the more admired, that so one never shews the bounds of his capacity. MAXIME LIX. The man that makes himself to be desired and regretted. If a man enter the house of Fortune by the gate of pleasure, he comes out commonly by the door of vexation. It is greater art to get out happily, than to enter it with popular applause. It is the
ordinary lot of fortunate people to have most favourable beginnings, and then a tragical end. Felicity consists not in ha∣ving the applause of the people at ones entry: for that is an advantage which all that enter have. The difficult matter is to have the same applause at ones exit. You see but very few who are regrated. It seldom happens that they who go out, are accompanied with good fortune. For it is her pleasure to be as surly to those that go, as she is civil and caressing to those who come. The same applause, says he in his Discreet, Chap. Hombre de buen dexo, that one hath had in the beginning, makes the murmuring the greater at the end. The fronts of Offices are all magnificent, but never the back parts, entries into Dignities are Crowned like Victories, but the goings off are attended with cur∣ses. What strange applauses to an Authori∣ty that begins, whether because of the pleasure that people take in changes, or of the hopes that every one hath to ob∣tain particular favours! but when it ex∣pires, alas, what silence! nay, and silence would stand in stead of a favourable ac∣clamation too. Prudence applies it self wholly to end
things well. It is far more attentive how to come out, than in listening to the ap∣plauses of an entry. A vigilant Palinu∣rus governed not his Vessel by the head, but by the stern. There he keeps him∣self, that he may conduct her through the voyage of this life: all the disgrace, (and as he says in the beginning of that Chapter) all the race of misfortune re∣mains for the end, as all the bitterness is at the ground of the potion. The pre∣cept of that Roman for beginning and ending was excellent, who said that he had obtained all Dignities before he desi∣red them, and had left them all, before they were desired by others. Misfortune is sometimes the punishment of immode∣ration. It is the comfort of the Wise, that they have retired before Fortune withdrew. Heaven it self hath employed that remedy in favours of some Heroes. Moses disappeared, and Elias was taken up, that so they might end in triumph. MAXIME LX. Good sense. Some are born Prudent, by a natural in∣clination they enter into the way of wise∣dom, and they are got almost half way
at first. Their reason ripens with age and experience, and at length they attain to the highest degree of judgment. They startle at capriciousness, as a temptation of their prudence, but especially in mat∣ters of State; which by reason of their extreme importance, require the strictest circumspection. Such men deserve to sit at the helm of Government, or at least to be Counsellers to those who hold it. MAXIME LXI. To excell in the excellent Is a thing very singular in the plu∣rality of perfections. There can be no Heroe without some extreme sublimity. Mediocrity is not an object big enough for applause. Eminence in a high em∣ployment distinguishes from the vulgar, and raises one to the category of rare men. To be eminent in a low profession, is to be great in little, and something in nothing. What is most delectable is least sublime. Eminence in high matters is as a character of Sovereignty, which ex∣cites admiration, and conciliates good will.
MAXIME LXII. To make use of good Instruments. Some make the quaintness of their wit to consist in employing bad instruments. A dangerous point of honour, and wor∣thy of an unhappy issue. The excellence of the Minister hath never lessened the glory of the Master: on the contrary, all the honour of the success rebounds upon the principal cause; and in like manner all the blame. Fame sounds al∣ways the praises of the first Authours. It never says: That Man hath had good or bad Servants; but, That he hath been a good or bad Workman. One must therefore en∣deavour to chuse his Ministers well, since on them depends the immortality of Re∣putation. MAXIME LXIII. The excellence of Primacy. If Primacy be backed by Eminence, it is on a double account excellent. It is a great advantage to have the hand at play, for that gives the better on't, if the Cards be equal. Several had been the Phoenix
of their Profession, if others had not gone before them. The first have the birth∣right in the inheritance of reputation, and there remains but a scanty portion of the Juniors, nay and that too conte∣sted. It's to no purpose for those to fret, they cannot baffle the opinion which the world hath, that they doe no more but imitate. Great spirits have always affec∣ted a new way for attaining to excellence: yet so, that Prudence hath always been employed for their guide. The Wise by the novelty of their enterprises get them∣selves to be listed in the Catalogue of He∣roes. Some had rather be the Captains of the second form, than the seconds of the first. MAXIME LXIV. To vex as little as may be. Is a most usefull Science. It's as the Midwife to all the happiness of life. It is good for nothing either to give or re∣ceive bad tidings. We are onely to give entry to those that asswage trouble. There are some who employ their Ear onely in hearing flatteries; others please them∣selves to listen to false reports; and some cannot live so much as one day without
some vexation, no more than Mithrida∣tes could without poison. Nay, it is a far greater absurdity for one to be willing to disturb himself as long as he lives, that he may once give satisfaction to another, how closely soever he may be linked to him. We must never offend against our selves, to comply with him, who advises, and keeps off at a distance. It is there∣fore a rational and usefull lesson, that as often as it is put to thy option to please another or displease thy self, thou'lt doe better to let another be discontented, than to become so thy self, and that with∣out remedy. MAXIME LXV. The quaint and critical Judgment. The judgment is cultivated as well as the wit. The excellence of understan∣ding refines the desire, and then the plea∣sure of enjoyment. The extent of the capacity is measured by the niceness of the judgment. A great capacity stands in need of a great object to give it con∣tent, as a large stomach requires propor∣tionable food, so high minds demand elevated matters. The noblest objects are afraid of a delicate judgment, perfec∣tions
that are generally esteemed, dare not hope to please it. Seeing there is but very little without defect, one ought to be very sparing of esteem. Judgments are formed in conversation, and we make another man's judgment our own by fre∣quenting his company. It is then a great happiness to have commerce with per∣sons of an excellent judgment. Yet we must not make profession of esteeming nothing at all. For that is an extreme folly, and an affectation more odious than a depraved palate. Some would have God to make another world, and other beauties to satisfie their extravagant and whimsical fancies. MAXIME LXVI. To take good measures before one under∣takes. Some eye the project more than the event: and nevertheless direction is not a sufficient surety to save one from the dishonour that attends an unfortunate issue. The Conquerour has no account to give. There are but a few who are capable to examine the reasons and cir∣cumstances, but every one judges by the event. And therefore a successfull man
never loses his reputation. A happy end crowns all, though wrong means may have been used for attaining to it. For it is art to go contrary to art, when other∣wise one cannot compass what he intends. MAXIME LXVII. To prefer plausible Employments. Most things depend upon the satisfac∣tion of others. Esteem is to perfections, what the Zephyres are to flowers; that is to say, nourishment and life. There are some employments generally applau∣ded, and others, which though they be high, yet are not courted. The former gain the good will of all, because they are managed in sight of all people. The other are more majestuous, and as such, attract more veneration: but because they are undiscernable, they are the less applauded to. Amongst Princes, the victorious are the more celebrated: and hence it is that the Kings of Aragon have been so famous, by their titles of War∣riours, Conquerours, Magnanimous. Let a man of merit, if he would eternise his memory by general applause, chuse then such employments, wherein every one hath some knowledge, and all have a share.
Some, says the Authour in the eighth Chapter of his Heroe, prefer difficult employments before others that are more plausible, the admiration of some choice men being more charming to them, than the applause of a great many in the crowd. They call plausible enterprizes the mira∣cles of the ignorant. The truth is, few men know the difficulty and excellence of a great undertaking; but seeing these are sublime spirits, for all they are so few, they fail not to put them in vogue. What is plausible is easily known, it familiarizes it self to the senses; but then the applause it receives, is so much the more vulgar, that it is universal. The daintiness of the small number carries it over the multi∣tude of the vulgar. Nevertheless, it is the character of a fine wit, to bribe com∣mon attention by the charm of plausi∣bility: since eminence dazling the Eyes of all, settles Reputation by common con∣sent. We must esteem what most esteem. The excellence of plausible actions is con∣spicuous: whereas those which are above the ordinary reach, are never so evident, but that they are still very metaphysical, being no ways illustrious but by the Idea's that men conceive of them. I call that plausible which is acted in view, and to the satisfaction of all people, and hath
always reputation for a basis. Whereby I exclude some employments that are as void of credit, as they are full of osten∣tation. A Comedian is rich in applauses, but poor in esteem. In the functions of the mind the plausible hath ever had the honour. A polite and smooth running discourse tickles the ears, and charms the understanding: on the contrary, a dry, bombast, metaphysical expression offends or cloys the hearers. And in his Discreet, Chap. Hombre de buena election: There are, saith he, employments, the chief exercise whereof consists in chusing, and which depend more upon others, than upon the practiser: as are all such whose end is to teach and please. Let the Ora∣tour then prefer plausible arguments. The Historian mingle the pleasant with the usefull: and the Philosopher the specious with the sententious. Let them all study to fit the universal relish of others; which is the true method of chusing. For it is the same as in a Feast, where the Dishes are not drest for the palate of the Cooks, but of the Guests. What signifies it, that the matters exceedingly please the Ora∣tour, if they be not relished by the hea∣rers, for whom they are prepared?
—Nam coenae fercula nostrae, Malim convivis, quam placuisse cocis. Saith Martial. MAXIME LXVIII. To inform, is far better than to put in mind. Sometimes we are to rememorate, sometimes advise. There are many who fail to doe things which would be excel∣lent, because they thought not of them. Then it is that a good advice is in season, to make them conceive what is important to be done. It is one of the greatest Ta∣lents of a man to have a present mind to think on what he hath to doe, for want whereof many affairs miscarry. He then that comprehends, is to carry the light; and he that needs to be lighted, ought to make application to the other. The first ought to be sparing, and the other dili∣gent. It's enough for the former to clear the way for the latter. This is a very important maxime, and profitable for him that instructs: and in case his first lesson be not sufficient, he ought with pleasure to proceed. Having once conquered the Nay,
he must dextrously catch hold of a Yea. For it often happens, that nothing is ob∣tained, because nothing attempted. MAXIME LXIX. Not to be of the humour of the vulgar. He is a great man that gives no admis∣sion to popular impressions. It is a lesson of Prudence to reflect upon ones self, to know ones own inclination, to prevent it, and even to goe to the other extremity, that one may find the poise of reason be∣twixt nature and art. The knowledge of ones self is the beginning of amend∣ment. There are some Monsters of im∣pertinence, who are now of one humour, and by and by of another; and change their opinions as their humours. They engage in quite contrary affairs, being always hurried away by the impetuosity of that civil torrent, which not onely corrupts the will, but also the knowledge and judgment. A great Capacity (saith the Authour in the Chapter, No rendirse al humor of his Discreet) is never carried with the flux and reflux neither of humours, nor of passions. It is always above that clownish immoderation. Many shame∣fully
suffer themselves to be tyrannized over by the predominant humour. They maintain to day what they contradicted yesterday. Sometime they stand for rea∣son, and sometimes they trample it under foot. There is no rest for their judge∣ments, which is the height of extrava∣gance. You cannot take them in a good sense, because they have none. Yesterday and to day they differ as much as black and white: and then having been the first to contradict themselves, they contradict all others. When once we understand their depraved mind, it is best to let them a∣lone in their own confusion. For the more they doe, the more they undoe. It is the sign of a rich stock of sense, to know how to prevent and correct ones humour, since it is a disease of mind, wherein a wise man ought to govern himself as in a distemper of body. There are such far gone impertinents, that they are always in some humour; always galled with some passion; insup∣portable to those who have to doe with them, perpetual Enemies of conversation and civility, who have no relish of the best things; more incurable than stark fools. For with a little compliance these are wheedled, and those grow worse by it. There is nothing to be got of them
by reason, for having none themselves, they'll receive none from others. But if a man sometimes fall into a passion, and that but rarely, and for a great cause, that will be no ground to ac∣cuse him of a vulgar humour. For never to be angry, is to be always a Beast. But a constant bad humour, and towards all people, is insupportable Clownishness. Anger, which makes the slave, may still be a sawce for a free state. But he that is not capable of knowing himself, will be still less of correcting himself. MAXIME LXX. To know how to refuse. All is not to be granted, nor to all. To know how to refuse, is as important as to know how to bestow; and it is a very necessary qualification in those who com∣mand. All consists in the manner. A Nay of some is better received than a Yea of others, because a Nay seasoned with civili∣ty, gives greater content than a Yea with bad grace. There are some who have always a Nay in their mouth. No, is al∣ways their first answer, and though they chance afterwards to grant all that's desi∣red, they have no thanks for it, because
of the unsavoury No that went before. We must not refuse point blanck, but make our denial be taken down by little sips, if I may say so. Nor must we re∣fuse all things neither, lest we put peo∣ple into despair: but on the contrary, leave always a remnant of hope to swee∣ten the bitterness of the denial. Let Courtesie fill up the vacuity of favour, and good words supply the defect of good deeds. Yea and No are soon said, but before we say them, we should think on them long first. MAXIME LXXI. Not to be unequal, and irregular in ones proceeding. A prudent man never falls into that fault neither through humour nor affecta∣tion. He is still the same in relation to that which is perfect; which is the mark of a sound judgment. If sometimes he change, it is because the countenance of occasions and affairs is changed. All ine∣quality mis-becomes Prudence. There are some who dayly differ from them∣selves. Their understanding is even jour∣nal, and much more their will and con∣duct. What was yesterday their pleasant
Yea, is to day their unpleasant No. They always falsifie their proceeding, and the opinion that men have of them, because they are never themselves. MAXIME LXXII. The man of resolution. Irresolution is worse than bad execu∣tion. Waters corrupt not so long as they run, but when they are standing. There are some men so irresolute, that they ne∣ver doe any thing but when they are pusht on to it by others: and that some∣times proceeds not so much from the puzle of their judgment, which is often quick and subtile, as from a natural lazi∣ness. It is a sign of a great mind to raise to it self difficulties, but of a greater to know how to clear them. There are also men who are puzled at nothing, and these are born for great employments, inasmuch as the quickness of their con∣ception, and steadiness of their judg∣ment, facilitate to them the understan∣ding and dispatch of affairs. Whatever falls into their hands is as good as done. One of that character having given the Law to one whole world, had time e∣nough over and above to think of another.
Such men undertake with assurance, un∣der the protection of their good fortune. MAXIME LXXIII. To find out Evasions Is the knack of men of wit. With a touch of gallantry they extricate them∣selves out of the greatest labyrinth. A gracefull smile will make them avoid the most dangerous quarrel. The greatest of Captains founded all his Reputation upon that. A word of a double meaning a∣greeably palliates a negative. There is nothing better, than never to be too well understood. MAXIME LXXIII. Not to be inaccessible. The true wild Beasts are where most people are. A difficult access is the vice of those whose manners honour hath changed. To begin by rejecting of o∣thers, is not the way to get credit. How pleasant is it to see one of those untracta∣ble monsters strut it in the garb of haugh∣tiness! They, who are so unhappy as to have business with them, goe to their
Audience, as if they were going to fight with Tigers, that's to say, armed as much with fear as circumspection. To mount up to that post they cringed to all peo∣ple; but so soon as they are in it, it seems they would take their revenge by huffing every body. Their employment requires that they should be free to all men: but their pride and surly humour makes them accessible to no man. So that the true way to be revenged on them, is to let them alone by themselves, to the end, that wanting all conversation, they may ne∣ver become wise. MAXIME LXXV. To propose to ones self some Heroe, not so much to be imitated, as to be surpassed. There are models of grandeur, and living books of reputation. Let every one propose to themselves those who have excelled in their Profession, not so much to follow as to outstrip them. Alexan∣der wept, not that he saw Achilles in the Tomb, but to see himself so little known in the world, in comparison of Achilles. Nothing inspires more Ambition than the fame of another's Reputation. That which stisles envy, gives breath to cou∣rage.
MAXIME LXXVI. Not to be always in the jocose humour. Prudence appears in seriousness; and the serious are more esteemed than the jocose. He that drolls always, is never a thorough-pac'd man. We use these men, as we do liars, not believing what one nor the other says, jeasting being no less suspected than lying. It is never known when they speak with judgment, which is the same as if they had none at all. There is nothing more unpleasant than a continual pleasantness. By en∣deavouring to purchase the Reputation of being pleasant, one loses the advantage of being thought wise. Some minutes are to be allowed to mirth, and the rest to seriousness. MAXIME LXXVII. To be company for all sorts of men. He is a wise Proteus that is holy with the holy, learned with the learned, se∣rious with the serious, and jovial with the merry. That is the way to gain all hearts, similitude being the bond of good
will. To discern tempers, and by a po∣litick transformation to suit the humour and character of every one, is a secret absolutely necessary for those who de∣pend on others. But that requires a great stock. A man who is universal in know∣ledge and experience, has less trouble in doing it. MAXIME LXXVIII. The art of undertaking to purpose. Folly enters always at random: for all fools are bold. The same ignorance which hinders them at first from conside∣ring what is necessary, hides from them afterwards the knowledge of the faults which they commit. But Wisedom en∣ters with great circumspection. Her Fore-runners are reflexion and discretion, that scour the roade for her, that so she may advance without any danger. Dis∣cretion condemns all kinds of temerity to a precipice, though good fortune some∣time justify them. One ought to go step by step where he suspects there is any depth. It is the part of judg∣ment to try, and of Prudence to pur∣sue. There are at present great shelves in the commerce of the world. We
ought therefore to have a care of our soundings. MAXIME LXXIX. The jovial humour Is rather an accomplishment than a de∣fect, when there is no excess in it. A grain of mirth seasons all. The greatest men, as well as others play their frolicks, for conciliating the good will of every body: but with this difference that they always retain the preference for wisedom, and respect to decency. Others come off when they are gone too far by a spell of good humour. For some things are to be taken laughing, and the very same some∣times that others take in good earnest. Such a humour is the loadstone of hearts. MAXIME LXXX. To be carefull to be informed. The life of man is almost wholly spent in taking information. What we see is the least essential. We live upon the credit of others. The ear is the se∣cond door to truth, and the first to lies. Commonly truth is seen, but it is extra∣ordinary
to hear it. It seldom comes pure to our ears, especially when it come from a far. For then it takes some tinc∣ture of the passions that it meets by the way. It pleases or displeases, according to the colours that passion or interest give it, which aim always at prepossessing. Have a care of him that praises; but much more of him that blames. There it is that one hath need of a sharp sight, to discover the intention of him that makes his pass, and to know before hand where he has a mind to hit. Make use of reflexion in discerning the slight or counterfeit from the good stuff. MAXIME LXXXI. To revive ones Reputation from time to time Is the privilege of the Phoenix. Ex∣cellence is subject to grow old, and with it in like manner fame. Custome lessens admiration. An ordinary novelty com∣monly carries it from the highest excel∣lence, that begins to grow old. One had need then to revive in valour, wit, for∣tune, in all things, and to shew always new beauties, as the Sun doth, which so often changes Horizons and Theatres,
that so privation may make him desirable when he sets; and novelty admirable, when he rises. MAXIME LXXXII. Not to pry too much neither into good nor evil. A wise man comprehended all his wisedom in this Precept, ne quid nimis, nothing too much. Too strict a justice de∣generates into injustice. The Orange that is too much squeezed, yields a bitter juice. Nay in enjoyment, we ought ne∣ver to go to either of the two extremes. Wit it self is exhausted by too much strai∣ning. By endeavouring to draw down too much milk, bloud is often fetched. MAXIME LXXXIII. To commit some small faults on design. A little negligence sometimes sets off good qualities. Envy hath its Ostracism, and that Ostracism is the more in fashion. That it is unjust. It accuses that which is perfect of the fault of being without a fault: and the perfecter the thing is, the more it condemns it. It is an Argus in discovering faults in that which is most
excellent, and perhaps out of spight of co∣ming short of it. Censure is like the Thun∣derbolt that commonly falls upon the highest Mountains. It is convenient then to sleep sometimes, as the good Homer did, and to affect certain failings whether in wit or courage, (but without annoying reason) to appease ill will, and to hinder the imposture of bad humour from brea∣king. That is the throwing of ones cloak before the Eyes of Envy, to save repu∣tation for ever after. MAXIME LXXXIV. To know how to draw advantage from Enemies. All things are to be taken, not by the blade, which may hurt; but by the han∣dle, which is the way for defence. And upon better reason envy. The wise man draws more advantage from his Enemies, than the fool does from his Friends. The envious are as a spur to the wise man to make him surmount a thousand difficul∣ties: whereas flatterers many times divert him. Many owe their fortune to their enviers. Flattery is more cruel than ha∣tred, in as much as it palliates the faults, which the other makes us remedy. The
wise man makes the hatred of his Enviers his looking-glass, wherein he sees himself far better than in that of kindness. That looking-glass shews him the faults which he corrects, and thereby prevents back∣biting. For men keep upon their close guard, when they have rivals, or Enemies for Neighbours. MAXIME LXXXV. Not to be lavish of ones self. It is the misfortune of all that is excel∣lent to degenerate into abuse; when it is too much made use of. What all men passionately covet, comes at length to displease all men. It's a great unhappi∣ness to be good at nothing; as also to de∣sire to be good at every thing. These al∣ways lose, through a desire of gaining too much; and at long run they are as much hated, as they were favoured before. All perfections are obnoxious to this lot: so soon as they lose the reputation of be∣ing rare, they get that of being common. The onely remedy for every thing that excells, is to be moderate in shew. The excess ought to be in the perfection, and the mean in the manner of shewing it. The more light a Torch gives, the shor∣ter
while it lasts. What is cut off from appearance and ostentation, is fully made up in esteem. MAXIME LXXXVI. To arm against Calumny. The vulgar hath many Heads and Tongues, and by consequent more eyes also. Let a bad rumour slip amongst these Tongues, that alone is enough to blemish the highest Reputation: and if that rumour turn into a nick-name, fare∣well all the esteem that a man hath ac∣quired. These scoffs hit commonly upon certain obvious defects, which, if they be singular, furnish ample matter of derision. And as there are imperfections which pri∣vate envy exposes to the eyes of publick malice: there are also sharp edged Tongues, which with a word blurted in the air, destroy more suddenly a great Reputation, than others do with all their impudence. It is very easie to have an ill name, because evil is soon believed, and sinistrous impressions are very diffi∣cult to be obliterated. A wise man there∣fore ought to be upon his Guard. For it is easier to prevent Calumny, than to remedy it.
MAXIME LXXXVII. To cultivate and embellish. Man is born barbarous. He is ranso∣med from the condition of Beasts, onely by being cultivated. The more he is cul∣tivated, the more he becomes man. In respect of Education, Greece had reason to call all the rest of the world barba∣rous. There is nothing so rude as igno∣rance; nor nothing that polishes more than knowledge. But (knowledge it self is rude, if it be without art. It is not enough that the understanding is cleared, the will must also be regulated, and the manner of conversing more.) There are some men naturally polished, whether as to conceiving, or speaking; as to the ad∣vantages of the body, which are but as the bark; or of the mind, which are the fruit. There are others again so clownish, that all their actions, and sometimes even the rich Talents which they have, are disfigured by the ruggedness of their hu∣mour.
MAXIME LXXXIII. To study to have a gentile Carriage in Actions. A great man ought never to be punctili∣ous in his proceedings. One must never nib∣ble too much at things, especially at those which are not agreeable. For though it be usefull to observe every thing by the bye, yet it is not so to dive into them purposely. We ought commonly to ca∣ry with a gentile indifference, which makes a part of Gallantry. To dissem∣ble is the chief means to govern. It is good to pass by a great many things that occur in the commerce of life, but parti∣cularly amongst Enemies. The too much is always irksome, and in humour it is unsupportable. It is a kind of madness to hunt after vexations. And ordinarily such is the way of carriage, as the hu∣mour is in which one acts. Our actions take the character of the humour we are in when we doe them.
MAXIME LXXXIX. Exactly to know ones Genius, Mind, Heart and Passions. One cannot be master of himself, un∣less he know himself to the bottom. There are looking-glasses for the face, but none for the mind. That then must be supplied by a serious reflexion upon ones self. When the external image is gone, let the internal retain and correct it. Measure thy strength and skill before thou undertake any thing. Know thy activity that thou mayst engage, fathom thy depth, and examine how far thy ca∣pacity may reach in all things. MAXIME XC. The way to live long Is to live well. There are two things which shorten the life, solly and wicked∣ness. Some have lost it, because they knew not how to keep it; others because they would not. As vertue is its own re∣ward, so is vice its own executioner. Whoever lives fast in vice, dies soon, and that two ways: whereas they who live
fast in vertue never die. The integrity of mind is communicated to the body: and a good life is always long, not onely in the intension, but in the extension also. MAXIME XCI. To act without fear of failing. The fear of not succeeding, discovers the weakness of him that acts to his Ri∣val. If, even in the heat of passion, the mind is in suspense, so soon as that first flash is over, he will upbraid himself with his own imprudence. All actions that are done with doubting are dangerous, it were better to let them alone. Prudence is not satisfied with probabilities, it goes always on sure grounds. How can that enterprise succeed which fear damns, so soon as the mind hath conceived it? And if a resolution that hath been unani∣mously taken in the council of Reason, hath often a bad issue, what is to be ex∣pected from that which hath wavered from the beginning in reason and prog∣nostication.
MAXIME XCII. A transcendent Wit in all things Is the principal rule, whether for acting or speaking. The more sublime employ∣ments are, the more that Wit is ne∣cessary. A grain of Prudence is worth more than a barn full of subtilty. It is a way that leads to infallibility, although it touches not so much upon plausibility. Though the fame of Wisedom be the tri∣umph of Renown, yet it will suffice to content the wise, whose approbation is the touch-stone of enterprizes. MAXIME XCIII. The universal Man. The man who possesses all sorts of per∣fections, is alone worth a great many others. He renders life happy by com∣municating to others. Variety joined to perfection is the recreation of life. It is great skill to know how to furnish ones self with all that is good. And since na∣ture hath in man, as in the most excel∣lent of her works, made an abridgment of the whole Universe, Art ought also to
make of the mind of man an universe of knowledge and vertue. MAXIME XCIV. An inexhaustible Capacity. Let a man of parts have a special care that no man sound the depth of his know∣ledge and skill, if he would be reveren∣ced by all. Let him suffer himself to be known, but not to be comprehended. Let no man have that advantage over him as to find out the bounds of his ca∣pacity, lest he may come to be unde∣ceived. Let him husband himself so well, that no body may see him entirely. Opinion and doubting procures more ve∣neration to him of whose wit and parts the reach is not known, than when he is fully known to be what he is, let him be never so accomplished and great. The Authour Comments excellently upon this Aphorism in the first Chapter of his Heroe. As no man, says he, dares to cross a River on foot, untill he hath found out the foard, even so a man is reverenced so long as one sees not the bottom of his ca∣pacity, inasmuch as an unknown depth, and by consequent presumed to be great,
is respected out of fear. If he, who dis∣covers, becomes the master of him that is discovered, as the Proverb saith: he that stands upon his guard is never sur∣prized. Let the address of a witty man way-lay the curiosity of him that at∣tempts to find it out. For it is in the be∣ginnings of an essay that curiosity em∣ploys all its cunning. If one cannot be infinite, he ought at least endeavour to appear so. The wise man of Mitilene had reason to say, that the half was more than the whole, seeing one half in shew, and the other in reserve, is better than a whole made manifest. Thou then who aspirest to greatness, and art a candidate of Re∣nown observe well this Precept. Let all men know thee, but no man know thee thoroughly. By that industry thy little will appear great; thy great more, and thy more infinite. MAXIME XCV. To know how to entertain another's ex∣pectation. The way to feed it is always to give it fresh nourishment. Much ought to promise more; a great action ought to serve for a spur to others greater. All
must not be shewn at first time. It's a piece of skill to know how to measure ones strength according to necessity and time, and dayly to discharge what is day∣ly expected by the publick. MAXIME XCVI. Conscience. Is the Throne of Reason, and the basis of Prudence. When that is consulted, it is easie not to miscarry. It is a gift of Hea∣ven, and being so important as it is, can∣not be too much desired. It is the chief piece of the Armour of Man, and is so necessary to him, that it would be suffi∣cient, though all the rest were wanting. All the actions of life depend upon its in∣fluence, and are esteemed good or bad, according as it judges of them, since eve∣ry thing ought to be done with reason. It consists in a natural inclination, which tends to equity, and takes always the su∣rer side. MAXIME XCVII. To acquire and preserve Reputation, Is to have and to hold Fame. Repu∣tation
costs much in the purchase, because it requires for that end eminent qualities, which are as rare as the indifferent are common. Being once purchased, it is easie to preserve it. It animates much, and acts still more. It is a kind of majesty, when it com∣mands veneration, by virtue of the subli∣mity of its cause and sphere. But that Re∣putation is the most substantial, which always hath been well supported. MAXIME XCVIII. To dissemble. Passions are the breaches of the mind. The most usefull knowledge is the art to dissemble. He that shews his Game, runs the risque of losing it. Let circum∣spection combat against Curiosity. Cover thine heart with a hedge of diffidence and reserve, from those who nibble too nicely at words. Let them never know thy disposition, lest they prevent thee either by contradiction or flattery. He who yields to his passions, saith the Authour, Chap. 2. of his Heroe, stoops from the state of a Man, to the condition of a Beast; whereas he that disguises them, preserves his Credit, at least in appearance. Our passions are the
swoonings of our Reputation. He that can make a sacrifice of his will, is Lord over himself. (To dive into the will of another, is a mark of a sublime wit: to be able to hide ones own, is to get the superiority over another. To discover ones thought, is to open the gate of the fort of the mind. Here it is that poli∣tick Enemies give the assault, and most frequently with success too. When once the passions are known, all the avenues and Sally-ports of the will are known, and by consequent it may be commanded upon any occasion.) A complete man must then in the first place apply himself to the sub∣duing of his passions, and then to the dissembling of them so artfully, that no spie can ever be able to unmask his thought. This Maxime teaches one to become an able man, when he is not; and so cunningly to hide all his imper∣fections, that all the sharp-sighted spies of another man's road, lose their way in seek∣ing it. That Catholick Amazon of Sapin, (he speaks of Queen Isabelle, Wife to Fer∣dinand) may serve as a pattern in that art. When she was to be brought to bed, she shut her self up in the darkest and most secret place of her Palace; that by a veil of darkness she might cover the sower faces and distorted looks that might
be forced from her in the agony of her labour, and hinder the shrieks and com∣plainings that might escape her in the ex∣tremity of pain, from coming to peoples ears. If she observed so great measures of decency and majesty on such occasions wherein every thing is excusable, how carefull must she have been in those where her Reputation was to be maintained? MAXIME XCIX. Reality and appearance. Things are not taken for what they are, but for what they appear to be. There is scarcely any one that sees into the inside, most part of men content themselves with shews. It is not enough to have a good intention, if the action look ill. MAXIME C. The Man undeceived. The Christian Sage. The Courtly Philosopher. It is fit to be so, but not to appear to be so, and far less to affect to be thought so. Though to Philosophize be the most worthy exercise of the wise, yet it is now
a-days out of fashion. The learning of able men is despised. Seneca having in∣troduced it into Rome, it was sometime in vogue at Court, and at present it passes there for folly. But Prudence and a good mind are not fed with prejudice. MAXIME CI. One part of the World laughs at the other, and both laugh at their common folly. Every thing is good or bad, according to the whimsey of People. That Fool is insupportable, who would have all things go according to his fancy. Perfections de∣pend not upon one single approbation. There are as many Opinions as Faces, and as great difference amongst the one as the other. There is no fault without an adherent, and thou oughtest not to be discouraged, if what thou doest, pleases not some, seeing there will always be others who will value it. But be not proud of the approbation of these, since you will be still exposed to the censure of others. The rule whereby to know what deserves esteem, is the approbation of men of worth, and of such as are ac∣knowledegdly capable of being good judg∣es of the thing. The civil life moves not
upon one single opinion, nor upon one sin∣gle custome. MAXIME CII. A stomach that can well receive the large mouth-fulls of Fortune. A great stomach is not the least part of the body of Prudence. A large ca∣pacity hath need of great parts. Pros∣perities cumber not him who deserves greater. What cloys some raises an appe∣tite in others. There are many who re∣ceive prejudice from all juicy food, be∣cause they are of a weak Constitution, and are neither born, nor bred up for so high employments. The commerce of the world is bitter to their taste, and the steams of their vain-glory, which mount up to their brain, occasion dangerous giddi∣nesses: high places make their heads to swim, they cannot hold themselves, be∣cause their fortune cannot hold within them. Let a man of Brains then shew, that he has still a place left to lodge a greater fortune in: and use all his industry to avoid every thing that may give the least sign of a low courage.
MAXIME CIII. Every one is to keep the grandeur that is proper for his state. Let all thy actions proportionably to thy condition, be the actions if not of a King, at least worthy of a King. That's to say, carry Royally, as much as thy fortune can allow. Let there be gran∣deur in thine actions, elevation in thy thoughts, to the end, that if thou be not a King in reality, thou mayst be one in merit.) For true Royalty consists in Ver∣tue. He has no reason to envy the gran∣deur, who may be the model thereof. But it concerns those chiefly who are up∣on the Throne, or who approach near to it, to make some provision of true supe∣riority, that's to say, of the qualities of majesty, rather than to please themselves with the Ceremonies, which vanity and luxury have introduced. They ought to prefer the solidity of substance before the emptiness of Ostentation.)
MAXIME CIV. To examine the nature of businesses. Every employment hath its way, he must be an essay-master that can judge the difference of them. Some employ∣ments require valour, others quickness: some demand onely probity, and others again Artifice. The first are more easie, and the others more difficult to be dis∣charged. For performing the first, good natural ability is sufficient, whereas for the others, all application and vigilance is too little. It is a very painfull office to have the government of men, but much more to have the conduct of Fools and Beasts. A double portion of sense is needfull for ordering of those that have none. That is an insupportable employ∣ment which requires a man's whole la∣bour, is stinted to hours, and hath always the same thing to doe. Those are much better wherein variety concurs with im∣portance, seeing change delights the mind. But the best of all are such, which are least dependant, or whose dependance is most remote: and that is the worst, which, when we come out of it, obli∣ges us to render an account to rigorous
Judges, and especially when it is to God. MAXIME CV. Not to be tedious. A man that hath but one business, or he that hath always the same thing to say, is commonly tedious. Brevity is fit∣ter for negotiation. It gains by delight∣ing what it loses by sparing. What is good, is doubly good, if it be short: and in like manner what is bad, is less so, if there be little of it.) Spirits operate bet∣ter than mingled Potions. It is a known truth that a great talker is seldom a man of parts. There are some men that give more trouble than honour to the Uni∣verse. They are clouts thrown out into the Streets, which every one kicks out of his way. A discreet man ought to have special care not to be troublesome, especially to men of much business. For it were better to be uneasie to all the rest of the world, than to one of those. What is well said, is said in short.
MAXIME CVI. Not to be proud of ones Fortune. Ostentation of Dignity offends more than ostentation of person. To carry high, is to become odious; it is enough to be envied. The more we hunt after Reputation, the less we find it. Seeing it depends on the judgment of others, no body can give it: and by consequent it must be merited and expected. Great employments require an authority suita∣ble to their Functions, and without that, they cannot be worthily discharged. We ought to preserve all the authority that is necessary for acquitting our selves of the main of our obligations: not to make too much of it, but second it. All who pre∣tend to be overcharged with business, shew themselves to be unworthy of their employments, as loaded with a burthen they are not able to bear. If any man would set himself off, let him doe it ra∣ther by a great personal worth, than by a borrowed character. Nay, a King ought to gain himself more veneration by his own worth, than by his Sovereignty, which is but an external thing.
MAXIME CVII. Not to appear pleased with ones self. To be dissatisfied with ones self, is weakness, and to be pleased, folly.) In most men that satisfaction proceeds from ignorance, and ends in a blind felicity, which, indeed, entertains pleasure, but preserves not the Reputation. As it is rare to judge well of the eminent quali∣ties of others, so men applaud to them∣selves in those they have, how vulgar and ordinary soever they be. Diffidence hath always been usefull to the wise, whe∣ther for taking such good measures, that affairs did succeed; or for comforting themselves when they succeeded not. For he that hath foreseen the evil, is the less troubled at it, when it happens. Some∣times Homer himself is asleep, and A∣lexander descends from the Throne of his Majesty, and acknowledges his weakness. Affairs depend on many circumstances, and what hath succeeded at one time, hath been unfortunate at another. But it is the incorrigibility of fools, that they turn their vainest thoughts into flowers, and that their weeds are always sprouting.
MAXIME CVIII. The shortest way to become a great man, is to be able to chuse his company. Conversation is of great weight. Man∣ners, humours, opinions, nay, and wit, are insensibly communicated. So a hasty man should frequent the company of one that is patient, and every one his contra∣ry. By this means they will without any labour attain to a fit temper. It is no small matter to be able to moderate ones self. The alternate variety of sea∣sons causes the beauty and duration of the Universe. As contrariety makes the harmony of natural things, so the har∣mony of civil society becomes more lovely by the difference of manners. Pru∣dence ought to make use of this policy in the choice of Friends and Servants, and from that communication of contraries a most delightfull temper will arise. MAXIME CIX. Not to be Reprehensive. There are some rough men that make a crime of every thing, not so much out
of passion, as of a natural disposition. In some they condemn all that they have done; in others all that they would doe: they so exaggerate every thing, that they make of motes, beams in the eye. Their worse than cruel humour, would be e∣nough to turn the Elysian field into a Galley. But if passion mingle with it, their rigour passes all bounds. On the contrary, Candour interprets every thing favourably, if not the intention, at least the inadvertency. MAXIME CX. Not to wait, till one be a setting Sun. It is a Maxime of Prudence to leave things, before they leave us. It is the part of a wise man to make a triumph of his own defeat, in imitation of the Sun, which, though still glorious in light, is accustomed to retire into a Cloud, that he may not be seen to decline; and by that means leave it in doubt, whether he be set, or not. He ought to draw out of the way of accidents, that he may not pine away with fretting. Let him not stay till fortune turn her back upon him, lest she should bury him alive, in regard of the affliction that it would give
him; and dead in respect of his Reputa∣tion. A good Horseman gives his Horse sometimes the Reins, that he may keep him from rearing up, and himself from derision, if he should chance to fall in the middle of the carriere. A beauty ought to prevent her glass by breaking it, be∣fore it come to shew her that her charms are fading. See the Maxime 38. MAXIME CXI. To make Friends. To have Friends, is a second being. Every Friend is good to his Friend. A∣mongst Friends all things are pleasant. A man can be worth no more than what others are pleased to value him at. To encline them then to that, we must seize their mouth by their heart. There is no better charm than good Offices. The best way to have Friends, is to make Friends. All the good we have in this life, depends on others. We are to live with our Friends or Enemies. Every day we ought to gain one, and if we make him not our confident, render him at least well affected. For some of these will become intimates when they are thoroughly known.
MAXIME CXII. To gain the Heart. The chief and sovereign cause of all things disdains not to prevent and dispose it, when he hath a mind to work the greatest works. By affection men enter into esteem. Some trust so much to their merit, that they take no care to make themselves be beloved. But the wise man knoweth well, that merit hath a great compass to fetch, when it is not assisted by favour. Good will facilitates all things. It supposes not always that there is wisedom, discretion, goodness, and capacity in the object; but it gives them. It never sees faults, because it avoids seeing of them. Commonly it springs from a material Correspondence, as being of the same Nation, Countrey, Profession or Family. There is another kind of affection more formal and eleva∣ted: for it is founded on obligations, re∣putation or merit. The difficulty is in gaining it; for it is easie to preserve it. By our care we may acquire it, and then make good use thereof.
MAXIME CXIII. In Prosperity to prepare for Adversity. Summer is the time when we can most commodiously make provisions for Win∣ter. In prosperity men have many Friends, and all things at a cheap rate. It is good to lay up somewhat for bad weather. For there is want of every thing in adversity. Thou'lt doe well not to neglect thy Friends, a day may come when thou wilt think thy self happy to have some, whom thou carest not for at present. Clownish people never have Friends, neither in prosperity, because they know no body; nor in adversity, because then no body knows them. MAXIME CXIV. Never to stand in competition. Every pretension that is contested, ruines the credit. Competition never fails to blacken that it may darken. It is a rare thing to play fair play. Emulation discovers faults, which civility concealed before. Many have lived in great esteem so long as they had no Competitours.
The heat of contradiction animates or raises to life infamies which were dead: it digs up again the filth, which time had almost consumed. Competition begins with a manifesto of invectives, calling to its assistence all that it can, and ought not. And though sometimes, nay, most times reproaches be arms of no great value, yet it makes use of them for the satisfaction of a base revenge: and it runs upon that so impetuously, that it covers the faults of the Rival with the dust of Oblivion. Good will hath always been peaceable, and Reputation indulgent. MAXIME CXV. To comply with the humours of those with whom one is to live. Men are very well accustomed to look on ugly faces: they may then accustome themselves to bad humours. There are some churlish Spirits, with whom, nor without whom, one cannot live. It is Prudence then to be accustomed to them, as to ugliness, if one would not be sur∣prized, nor frighted on some occasions. At first they terrify, but by little and lit∣tle we grow acquainted with them, re∣flexion preventing what is rude in them,
or at least helping us to bear with it. MAXIME CXVI. To deal always with men who are carefull of their duty. One may both engage with them, and engage them. Their duty is their best surety, even then when one is at va∣riance with them. For they always act like themselves: and besides, it is better to fight with honest men, than to triumph over the naughty. There is no safety in dealing with wicked men, because they never stand to what is just and reasona∣ble. And therefore there is no true Friend∣ship ever to be found amongst them. How great soever their affection may seem to be, it is always of base allay, because it has not any principle of honour. Avoid always the man that hath none; for ho∣nour is the throne of honesty. Whoever esteems not honour, esteems not vertue. MAXIME CXVII. Never to speak of ones self. To praise ones self is vanity; to blame, meanness. And what is a defect of wise∣dom
in him that speaks, is a trouble to those that hear him. If that be to be shunned in familiar or domestick conver∣sation, it is more to be avoided in pub∣lick, when one speaks and holds some great post, for then the least folly passes for down-right simplicity. It is the same errour in Prudence to speak of those who are present. For there is danger of split∣ting upon one of two rocks, either of flattery or censure. MAXIME CXVIII. To affect the name of being obliging. There needs no more but that, to be∣come plausible. Civility is a chief part of the knowledge how to live, it is a kind of charm that attracts the love of all men: whereas Clownishness makes one hated and despised. For if incivility proceed from pride, it deserves to be hated; if from brutishness, it is contemptible. Too much does better in civility, than too lit∣tle. But it ought not to be alike to all; for then it would degenerate into injustice. It is even a duty, and in use amongst Enemies, which shews the power of it. Whoever honours is honoured. Gallan∣try and Civility have that advantage,
that all the glory of them rests upon their Authours. MAXIME CXIX. Not to affect to be Churlish. We ought never to provoke aversion, it comes fast enough without being sought after. There are a great many people who hate at a venture, and know neither how nor why. Hatred is readier than good will. Humour is more enclined to hurt, than to doe service. Some affect to be at odds with every body, either through a spirit of contradiction, or be∣cause they are out of humour. When once hatred has got possession of their heart, it is as hard to root it out again, as to undeceive them. Men of wit are fea∣red; backbiters are hated; the presump∣tuous are despised; scoffers are abhorred; and the singular are forsaken of all men. To be esteemed then, we must esteem. He that would make his Fortune, sets a value upon every thing.
MAXIME CXX. To comply with the Times. Knowledge it self ought to be accor∣ding to the mode, and it is no small piece of wit to counterfeit the ignorant, where there is no knowledge. The relish and language change according to times. We must not speak in the old fashion; the relish must take with the new. The re∣lish of good heads serves for a rule to others in every profession, and by conse∣quent we are to conform to it, and en∣deavour to improve our selves. Let a prudent man accommodate himself to the present, whether as to body, or mind, though the past may even seem better unto him. In manners onely that rule is not to be observed, seeing vertue is at all times to be practised. It is not known now a-days, what it is to speak truth, to keep ones word. If any doe so, they pass for old-fashioned people. So that no body imitates them, though all love them. Unhappy age, wherein vertue passes for a stranger, and vice for a cur∣rent mode! Let a wise man then live as he can, if he cannot as he would. Let him be content with what lot hath given
him, as if it were better than what it hath denied him. MAXIME CXXI. Not to make much of nothing. As there are some that perplex them∣selves about nothing, so there are others who puzle themselves about every thing. They speak always like Ministers of State. They take all things either literally or mystically. Few of those things that occasion trouble, are to be minded: else we shall torment our selves much in vain. It's to act the clean contrary way, to lay that to heart, which we should throw be∣hind our backs. Many things that were of some consequence, have signified nothing at all, because men troubled not them∣selves about them; and others which signi∣fied nothing, have become matters of im∣portance, because of the value that was put upon them. In the beginning, it is easie to master all; but not so afterwards. Most commonly the remedy increases the evil. It is not then the worst rule of living, to let things go as they come.
MAXIME CXXII. Authority in Words and Actions. That quality takes place every where, it presently commands respect. It shews it self over all, in the Conversation, in Harangues, in the carriage, in the look, and in the meen. To take hearts is a great conquest. That is not attained to by a foolish bravery, nor by an imperious way of speaking, but by a certain Ascen∣dant that springs from the greatness of the Genius, and is supported by an ex∣traordinary merit. MAXIME CXXIII. The Man without Affectation. The more there is of perfection, the less there is of affectation. For it is that commonly which spoils the finest things. Affectation is as insupportable to others, as it is painfull to him that uses it, who lives in a continual martyrdom of con∣straint, that he may be punctual in all things. The most eminent qualities lose their value, if affectation be discovered in them, because they are attributed ra∣ther
to an artificious constraint, than to the true character of the person. And what is natural, hath always been more agreeable than what is artificial. A man is looked upon to be a stranger to all that he affects. The better one does a thing, the more he ought to hide the care he takes in doing of it, to the end that all may take it to be natural. But in avoi∣ding of affectation, have a special care you fall not into it, by affecting not to be affected. An accomplished man ought never to give the least sign that he is per∣swaded of his own merit: the less he ap∣pears solicitous to make it known, the more all will mind it. He is doubly excel∣lent, who confines all his perfections within himself, without bragging of any; he arrives at the height of plausibility, by a way not much frequented. MAXIME CXXIV. How to be Regrated. Few have that happiness, and yet it is an extraordinary one to be regrated by good men. Commonly people are indifferent as to those who have finished their time. There are divers means of meriting the honour to be regrated. Visibly eminent
qualities in discharging ones office is a very sure one; and to please all people is one effectual. Eminence begets dependance; so soon as it appears that the office stood in need of the man that discharges it; and not the man of the office. Some doe honour to their places, and others are ho∣noured for them. It is not an advantage to seem good, because one hath a bad suc∣cessour. For that is not to be truly re∣grated, but onely to be less hated. MAXIME CXXV. Not to be a book of Accounts. It's a sign of a bad Reputation, to take pleasure in blasting the Reputation of ano∣ther. Some are willing to wash out, or at least to cover their stains, by exposing those of others. They ease the sense of their own defects, by considering that others have faults also: which is the con∣solation of fools. These have always a stinking breath, their mouth being the sink of civil uncleanness. The more one digs into such matters, the more he be∣mires and defiles himself. There is no man but hath some original failing, whe∣ther to the right or to the left. The faults of those who are not much known, are
unknown. Let a prudent man take good heed that he be not a register of Calum∣nies. That's the way to set up for a very unpleasant pattern, and to be without a Soul, though one be alive. MAXIME CXXVI. To commit a folly makes not a fool; but not to know how to hide it, does. If one ought to hide his passions, much more he ought his faults. All men fail, but with this difference, that men of sense palliate the faults committed, and fools shew those they are about to commit. Reputation consists more in the manner of acting, than in what is done. If thou be not Chast, saith the Proverb, be cau∣tious at least. The faults of great men are the more remarkable, that they are the eclipses of great luminaries. How great soever thy Friendship be, never trust it with thy failings. Nay, hide them even from thy self, if it be possible. At least thou mayst make use of that other rule of living, which is to know how to forget.
MAXIME CXXVII. The secret charm, or the unexpressible some∣what; which the French call Le Je-ne∣sai-quoi. And the Spaniards El despejo. Is the life of great qualities, the breath of words, the soul of actions, and the lustre of all beauties. Other perfections are the ornament of nature; the unex∣pressible somewhat, that of perfections. It is observable even in the way of reaso∣ning. It holds much more of privilege than of study; for it is even above all discipline. It is not limited to facility, but reaches the finest Gallantry. It sup∣poses a free and unstinted mind, and to that unstintedness it adds the last strokes of perfection. Without it all beauty is dead, all gracefulness ungracefull. It hath the pre-eminence over valour, dis∣cretion, prudence, nay, and majesty it self. It is a politick high way wherein affairs are soon dispatched; and, in fine, the art of coming off gallantly when one is hampered. Here it will not be amiss for a Com∣mentary, to give the translation of the whole thirteenth Chapter of the Heroe, where he gives a notion a little more
distinct of what he calls the Despejo. The unexpressible somewhat, says he, is the soul of all qualities, the life of all perfections, the vigour of actions, the gracefulness of language, and the charm of all that takes. It agreeably amuses the conceit and imagination, but it is in∣explicable. It is something that enhaun∣ces the lustre of all beauties, it is a meta∣physical and formal beauty. Other per∣fections adorn nature, but the somewhat adorns the ornaments themselves. So that it is the perfection even of perfection, ac∣companied with a transcendent beauty, and universal gracefulness. It consists in a certain taking air, in an agreeableness that hath no name, but which is seen in speaking, in the ways of acting, and in reasoning. What is most lovely in it comes from nature, and the rest depends on reflexion. For it hath never been sub∣jected to any imperious precept, but al∣ways to the best of every kind. It is called a charm, because it inchants hearts; a fine air, because it is imperceptible; a brisk air, because of its activity; a taking air, because of its politeness; jollity and good humour, for its facility and com∣plaisance. For the desire and yet impos∣sibility of defining it, have got it all these names. It's to doe it wrong, to confound
it with facility; for that comes but at a great distance after it. It advances as far as the finest Gallantry. Though it suppose an entire disengagedness, yet it is devoted to perfection. Actions have their Mid∣wife, and they are obliged to this unex∣pressible somewhat when they are well de∣livered. Without it they are still-born, without it the best things are unsavoury. Nay, it is not so much the accessory nei∣ther, but that it is sometime the princi∣pal. It serves not onely for ornament, but also for support and direction in af∣fairs. For as it is the soul of beauty, so is it the spirit of Prudence, as it is the principle of gracefulness, so is it the life of valour. In a Captain, it goes hand in hand with bravery; and in a King with Prudence. In the shock of a battle, it is no less conspicuous in its assured and un∣daunted air, than in the skill of hand∣ling arms, and in resolution. It renders a General master of himself, and then of all others. It is as impetuous on Horse∣back, as it is majestick under the Canopy. In the Pulpit it gives a grace to words. By its golden thread, Henry IV. The Theseus of France dextrously guided his way through the Labyrinth of so many obstacles and affairs. For a gloss to this description of the
Despejo, which is very metaphysical what Father Bonhours says in the fifth Confe∣rence of Aristus and Eugenius, may serve. It is far easier to perceive it, than to know it, saith Aristus. It would be no longer I know not what, if one knew what it were; its nature is to be incom∣prehensible and inexplicable. And a page after. To take it right, it is neither beau∣ty, nor good meen, nor good grace, nor briskness of humour, nor sparkling wit, seeing we dayly see men, who have all these qualities, and yet want that which pleases: and others, on the contrary, who please much, without any thing that is agreeable, except this unaccountable luck. So that the certainest thing that can be said of it, is that the greatest merit sig∣nifies nothing without it, and that it nee∣deth no more but it self to work a very great effect. It is to no purpose to be handsome, witty, blithe, &c. if the un∣expressible somewhat be wanting, all these fair qualities are, as it were, dead: but al∣so what imperfections soever one may have in body or mind, with that sole ad∣vantage he is sure to please. This some∣what sets all to rights. From thence it follows, says Eugenius, that it is an agreea∣bleness which animates beauty, and the other natural perfections, which corrects
ugliness and other natural defects; that it is a charm and an air that insinuates into all actions and words; that enters into the gate, laughing, tone of the voice, and into the least gesture of the person that pleases. And four or five pages after. He saith that the Spaniards have also their No so que, which they bring in at eve∣ry turn, besides their Donayre, their Brio, and their Despejo, which Gracian calls, Alma de toda prenda, realce de los mesmos realces, perfeccion de la misma perfeccion, and which according to the same Authour, is above the reach of our thoughts and words. Lisongea la intelligencia, y estra∣na la explicacion. This I mention here, to shew, that the Despejo, is an I know not what, which hath no name: and that all those that are given to it, are pretty words, which the learned have invented to flatter their ignorance. These are the terms of Father Bonhours. MAXIME CXXVIII. The high Courage. Is one of the principal conditions re∣quired in a Heroe, inasmuch as such a courage spurs him on to all that is great, refines his discerning, raises his heart, ele∣vates
his thoughts and actions, and dispo∣ses him to majesty. It makes its way through, wherever it is: and when hard luck is cross to it, it essays all ways to come off with honour. The more it is confined within the bounds of possibility, the more it labours its enlargement. Mag∣nanimity, Generosity, and all Heroick Qualities, own it for their original. The strong head, saith Gracian, chap. 4. of his Heroe, is for Philosophers; the good Tongue for Oratours; the Breast for Wrestlers, the Arms for Souldiers, the Feet for Runners, the Shoulders for Por∣ters, and the great Heart for Kings. The Heart of Alexander was an Arch-heart, seeing a whole world lodged easily in a corner of it, and that six more could have found room therein. That of Ju∣lius Caesar was very great; seeing it found no mean betwixt all and nothing. The heart is the stomach of Fortune. It di∣gests alike her favours and disgraces. A great stomach is not loaded with much food. A Giant is starved with that which surfeits a Dwarf. That Prodigy of Valour, Charles, Dau∣phin of France, and afterward King, the seventh of that name, being informed that his Father, and the King of England his Competitour, had got him declared in
Parliament incapable of succeeding, an∣swered boldly, That he appealed from it. And when he was asked with admiration, To whom? To my Courage, and the point of my Sword, Replyed he. The effect followed it. Charles Emanuel, the Achilles of Savoy, defeated four hundred Cuirassiers, having but four men to stand by him: and perceiving that all were sur∣prized at it, he said, that in the greatest dangers, there was no company so good as a great heart. The sufficiency of the heart supplies what is otherwise wanting. The King of Arabia shewing his Cour∣tiers a Damask Cutlass that had been pre∣sented to him, it was the opinion of them all, that the onely fault they found in it, was, that it was too short. But the Kings Son said, That there was no Wea∣pon too short for a brave Cavalier, seeing there needed no more but to advance one step, to make it long enough. MAXIME CXXIX. Never to Complain. Complaints always ruine Credit. They rather excite a passion to offend us, than compassion to comfort us. They make way for those that hear them, to doe the
same to us, that those have done, of whom we complain, and the knowledge of the injury done by the first, serves the second for an excuse. Some by complaining of past offences, give occasion for future; and instead of the remedy and consola∣tion which they pretend, they give plea∣sure to others, and even attract their con∣tempt. It's far better policy to publish the obligations that one hath to people, thereby to stir up others to oblige also. To speak often of favours received from Persons absent, is to court the like from those who are present; it is a selling the credit of the one to the other. Thus a prudent man ought never to publish dis∣graces and failings, but always favours and honours. And this serves to preserve the esteem of Friends, and to contain Enemies in their duty. MAXIME CXXX. To doe, and make it appear. Things go not for what they are, but for what they appear to be. To know how to doe, and to know how to shew it, is a double knowledge. What is not seen, is as if it had no being. Reason it self loses its Authority, when it appears
not to be so. There are more mistaken men, than knowing men. Deceit carries it cleverly, in regard that things are one∣ly considered by the outside. Many things appear quite different from what they are. A good out-side is the best re∣commendation of internal perfection. MAXIME CXXXI. The procedure of a gallant Man. Souls have their gallantry and gentili∣ty, from which arises a great heart. That is a perfection not to be found in all sorts of men, because it supposes a stock of generosity. Its first care is to speak well of Enemies, and still to serve them bet∣ter. In occasions of revenge it appears most conspicuously. It neglects not these occasions, but it is onely to make a good use of them, by preferring the glory of pardoning, before the pleasure of a victorious revenge. That is even a poli∣tick procedure, seeing the quaintest rea∣son of state never affects these advanta∣ges, because it affects nothing: and when right obtains them, modesty dissembles them.
MAXIME CXXXII. To advise and revise. To revise is the surest way, especially when the advantage is certain: It is al∣ways good to take time, whether it be for granting a thing, or for better delibe∣rating. New thoughts come into ones mind, which confirm and fortify resolu∣tion. If the matter be to give, the gift is more esteemed, because of the discerning of him that gives it, than for the pleasure of not having expected it. What hath been desired, hath always been most esteemed. If it be a thing to be refused, time facilitates the manner of it, by let∣ting the No ripen, untill the season be come. Besides, most commonly so soon as the first heat of desire is over, the ri∣gour of a denial is taken with indiffe∣rence. They who demand with speed, are to be heard at leisure. That's the true way to avoid being surprized.
MAXIME CXXXIII. Rather to be a Fool with all Men, than Wise all alone. For if all be such, there is nothing to be lost, cry Politicians: whereas if Wise∣dom be singular, it will pass for folly. Custome then is to be followed. Some∣times to know nothing, or at least to seem so, is the greatest knowledge. We must of necessity live with others, and the ig∣norant are most numerous. To live a∣lone, one must hold much of the Nature of God, or to be altogether of that of Beasts. But for qualifying the Aphorism, I would say, Rather Wise with others, than a Fool without Company. Some affect to be singular in Chimera's. MAXIME CXXXIV. To have a double portion of the things that are necessary for life. Is to live doubly. We must not re∣strict our selves to one thing onely, even though it be excellent. All things ought to be double, and especially that which is usefull and delightfull. The Moon
that changes so often, is not so variable as the will of man, so fickle is that same will. We ought therefore to put a bar∣riere to our inconstancy. Take it then for a chief rule of the art of living, to have in a double portion all that serves for convenience. As Nature hath given us pairs of the Members which are most necessary and most exposed to danger, so ought Art to double the things, whereon the happiness of life depends. MAXIME CXXXV. Not to have a spirit of Contradiction. For that's the way to become ridicu∣lous, nay, and insupportable. Wisedom will never fail to conspire against that Spirit. It's to be ingenious to find diffi∣culties in all things; but it is foolish to be an Opiniatour. Such men turn the swee∣test conversation into a skirmish, and are by consequent greater Enemies to their Friends, than to those that frequent not their company. The more savoury the piece of fish is that we put into our mouth, the more we find the bone that gets betwixt our teeth. Contradiction hath the same effect in pleasant Conver∣sation. They are Fools and fantastical
ones, that are not satisfied to be Beasts, unless they be wild Beasts. MAXIME CXXXVI. To take things aright, and presently to nick the point. Many fetch a tedious compass of words, without ever coming to the knot of the business: they make a thousand turnings and windings, that tire themselves and others, without ever arriving at the point of importance. And that proceeds from the confusion of their understanding, which cannot clear it self. They lose time and patience in what ought to be let alone, and then they have no more to bestow upon what they have omitted. MAXIME CXXXVII. The Wise Man is sufficient for himself. A Grecian Sage was to himself in stead of all things; and all that he had was al∣ways with him. If it be true, that an universal Friend is sufficient to render one as contented, as if he possessed Rome, and all the rest of the Universe: be thine own Friend, and thou mayst live all alone.
What more can be wanting to thee, if thou hast no sweeter conversation, nor greater pleasure than with thy self? thou wilt onely depend upon thy self, for it is a sovereign bliss to be like the Sovereign Being. He that can so live all alone, will hold nothing of the Beast, but much of the Wise Man, and all of God. MAXIME CXXXVIII. The Art to let things go as they can go, especially when the Sea is tempestuous. There are Tempests and Hurricanes in the life of man. It is Prudence to put into a Haven, to let them blow over. Most commonly the Remedies increase the Evil. When the Sea of humours is in agitation, let Nature work; if it be the Sea of Manners, leave it to Morality. There is as much skill required in a Phy∣sician, in not prescribing, as in prescri∣bing: and sometimes the excellency of the Art consists in applying no Remedy. The way then to calm popular gusts, is to be quiet. Then to yield to the times, will get the victory afterwards. A Well will be troubled if it be in the least stir∣red, and its water becomes clear again, by ceasing to dabble in it. There is no
better remedy for some disorders, than to let them alone. For at long run they stop of themselves. MAXIME CXXXIX. To know unlucky days. For there are some, wherein nothing will succeed. It is to no purpose to change the Game, the luck will still be the same. At the second bout, we are to take heed, if luck be for us or against us. Understanding hath its days. For no man was ever alike able at all hours. There is good luck in reasoning truly, as there is in writing a Letter well. All perfections have their season, and beauty is not always in its quarter. Discretion sometimes belies it self, now in ceding, and by and by in exceeding. In fine, to succeed well, one must have his day. As all things succeed ill to some, so every thing prospers with others, and that too with less pains and care: and some find their business ready done to their hand. Wit hath its days; Genius its Character; and all things their star. When it is your day, you are not to lose a minute. But a prudent man ought not positively to pronounce, that one day is happy, be∣cause
of his good success; nor that ano∣ther is unlucky, because of his bad; the one being, perhaps, but the effect of chance; and the other of mistimeing. MAXIME CXL. To hit at first upon the best of every thing. Is the best mark of a good discerning. The Bee goes immediately to the sweet, that it may have whereof to make honey; and the Waspe to the bitter, to suck in poison. It is so in discernings; the one sticks to the best, and the other to the worst. In all things there is somewhat that is good, and especially in a book, which commonly is made with study. Some are of so aukward a mind, that a∣mongst a thousand perfections, they'll hit upon the onely fault that is to be found, and speak of nothing else, as if they were onely cut out for common sew∣ers of the filth of the will and wit of others: and for keeping a Register of all the faults which they see. That is rather the punishment of their bad discerning, than the exercise of their subtilty. They spend their life ill, because they onely feed on naughty things. Happier are they, who amongst a thousand faults at
first discover a perfection that happe∣ned to be there by chance. MAXIME CXLI. Not to listen to ones self. It's worth little to be satisfied with one self, if one content not others. Com∣monly self-esteem is punished by univer∣sal contempt. He that pays himself, re∣mains a debtor to all others. It is misbe∣coming for one to speak, that he may hear himself. If it be folly to speak to ones self, it is doubly so to listen to him∣self before others. It is a fault in great men to speak with an imperious tone: and that which stuns those who hear them; at every word they say, their ears importunately beg applause or flattery. The presumptuous speak also by echo: and since the conversation moves upon the stilts of Pride, every word comes guarded with this impertinent exclama∣tion: Rarely well said! Ah that's a sweet saying.
MAXIME CXLII. Never to espouse a bad party in spight to an Adversary, who hath taken the better. He that does it, is half overcome, and at length will be constrained wholly to yield. That is never a good way to be revenged. If thine Adversary hath had the skill to take the better, take good heed not to commit the folly of oppo∣sing him, by espousing the worse. Ob∣stinacy in actions engages so much the more than that in words, that there is far more risque in doing, than in saying. It is the custome of the head strong to re∣gard neither truth in contradicting; nor profit in disputing. A wise man hath al∣ways reason on his side, and never falls into passion. He either prevents or re∣treats. So that if his Rival be a Fool, his folly makes him change his course, and go to the other extreme: whereby the condition of his Adversary becomes worse. The onely means then to make him for∣sake the good party, is to strike in with it, seeing that will move him to embrace the bad.
MAXIME CXLIII. To take heed not to run into Paradoxes, by shunning to be vulgar. Both extremes equally discredit. Eve∣ry project that thwarts gravity, is a kind of folly. A Paradox is a certain plausi∣ble Cheat, that at sirst surprizes by its novelty and its edge; but afterwards lo∣ses its vogue, when the falsity of it is once known in practice. It is a kind of quacking, which in matter of Politicks, is the ruine of States. They who can∣not attain to Heroism, or who have not the courage to advance towards it by the way of vertue, run into the Paradox; which makes them to be admired by fools, but serves to manifest the Prudence of others. The Paradox is a proof of an ill-tempered mind, and by consequent, most opposite to Prudence. And if some∣times it be not founded on what is false, it is founded at least on what is uncertain, to the great prejudice of affairs.
MAXIME CXLIV. Ʋnder the veil of another man's interest, to find ones own. Is a most proper strategeme for obtai∣ning what one intends. The Confessours themselves teach this pious Craft as to what concerns salvation. It is a most im∣portant dissimulation, seeing the profit that is pretended, serves as a bait to attract the will. It seems to another that his inte∣rest goes first, when it is onely to make way for thy pretension. One must ne∣ver enter hap hazard, but especially where there is danger at the bottom. And when one hath to doe with those, whose first word is always No, he must not shew them what he aims at, lest they may see Reasons for not condescending to it: and chiefly if he foresee that they have an aversion thereto. This advice is for those that can turn their wits to any thing; which is the quintessence of subtilty. MAXIME CXLV. Not to shew the sore place. For every one will have a hit at it.
Have a care also not to complain of it, seeing malice always attacks on the wea∣ker side.) Resentment serves onely to di∣vert it. Nothing pleases malice better than to put one off of the hinges. It lets fall tart words, and sets all Engines at work, untill it hath found out the quick. A man of parts then ought ne∣ver to discover his evil, whether it be personal or hereditary: seeing Fortune her self takes pleasure sometimes to wound in that place, where she knows the pain will be sharper. It mortifies al∣ways to the quick: and by consequent, one must never let it be known either what mortifies, or what quickens; that he may make the one to cease, and the other continue. MAXIME CXLVI. To look into the inside. It is commonly found that things are far different from what they appear to be; and ignorance that onely looked on the bark, is undeceived so soon as it goes in. The lie is always the first in every thing, it draws in Fools by a vulgar They say, which runs from mouth to mouth; truth arrives always last, and very late, be∣cause
it hath a lame Guide, which is time. The Wise keep for it always one half of that faculty which nature hath purposely made double. Deceit is wholly superficial: and those who are so them∣selves, are presently catched. Discerning retires inward, that so it may be the more esteemed by the wise. MAXIME CXLVII. Not to be inaccessible. Let a man be never so perfect, he some∣times stands in need of Council. He that will take none is an incurable fool. The most intelligent man ought to make room for good advice. Sovereignty it self ought not to exclude docility. Some men are incurable, because they are inac∣cessible. They precipitate themselves, because no body dares come near them to hinder them from it. A door must then be left open to Friendship, and by it re∣lief will enter. A Friend ought to have full liberty to speak, nay, and to re∣prove. The Opinion that is conceived of his Fidelity and Prudence ought to give him that Authority. But withall, that familiarity is not to be common to all. It is enough to have one secret con∣fident,
whose correction is valued, and who is to be made use of as a looking-glass for undeceiving. MAXIME CXLVIII. To have the Art of Conversing. Is the means whereby a man shews his own value. Of all humane actions there is none that requires greater cir∣cumspection, seeing it is the most usual exercise of life. There is much Reputa∣tion to be gained or lost in it. If judge∣ment be necessary for writing a letter, which is a premeditated conversation by paper: far more it is required in ordinary conversation, which brings the merit of people under a sudden Test. The Masters of the Art feel the pulse of the Wit by the Tongue, according to the saying of a Sage, Speak, if thou would'st have me to know thee. Some maintain, that the true Art of conversing, is to doe it without Art: and that conversation, if it be be∣twixt good Friends, ought to be as easie as ones cloaths. For when it is a confe∣rence of Ceremony and Respect, it is to be performed with more reserve, to shew, that one hath much of the skill of li∣ving. The way to succeed well in that,
is to follow the character of those mens wit, who are as the judges of conversa∣tion. Take heed not to be vain in cen∣suring of words, which will make thee pass for a Grammarian; nor in controlling and chopping reasons, for then all will avoid thee. To speak to the purpose is more necessary than to speak eloquently. MAXIME CXLIX. To be able to cast the blame and misfor∣tunes upon others. It is a thing of great use amongst those who govern, to have Bucklers against hatred, that's to say, men upon whom the censure, and publick grievances may light: and that is not the effect of ina∣bility, as malice imagines; but of an in∣dustry elevated above the understanding of the people. Every thing cannot suc∣ceed, nor all men be contented. There ought to be in that case then a strong head, that may serve as a But to all the shot, and bear the reproaches of all faults and miscarriages, at the cost of his own Ambition.
MAXIME CL. To be able to put a value upon what one doeth. It is not enough that things are good in themselves, because all men see not to the bottom, nor are able to discern. Most part follow the multitude, and stop not but where the greatest concourse is. It's a great point to be able to set an esteem upon ones Commodity, either by prai∣sing it; (for praise is the spur to desire) or by giving it a pretty name, which is a good way to exalt: but all this must be done without affectation. Not to write but for able men, is an universal hook, because every one thinks himself to be so; and for those who are not, privation will serve as a spur to desire. Ones projects must never be called common, nor easie, for that's the way to make them be thought trivial. All men are pleased with singularities, as being most desira∣ble both to the humour and mind.
MAXIME CLI. To think to day what may happen to mor∣row, and a long time after. The greatest fore-sight, is to have hours for it. There is nothing fortuitous for those who forecast; nor any dange∣rous case for such as expect it. We must not put off the thoughts of danger till we be sinking; we must be before-hand, and by mature consideration prevent the worst that might happen. The Pillow is a dumb Sibylle. To sleep upon a thing that is to be done, is better than to be awaked by a thing already done. Some doe first, and afterwards think: which is rather to look for excuses than expedients. Others neither think before nor after. A man's whole life should be employed in thinking that he may not mistake his way. Reflexion and fore-sight give us the advantage of anticipating life. MAXIME CLII. Never to keep company that may eclipse ones lustre. What excells in perfection, excells in
esteem. The most accomplished will al∣ways have the first rank. If his Com∣panion have any part in the praise, it will be but his leavings. The Moon shines, whilst she is alone amongst the stars: but so soon as the Sun begins to appear, she either shines no more, or disappears. Never approach him that may eclipse thee, but him that may set off thy lustre. In this manner Martial's cunning Fabulla found the way of appearing beautifull, by the ugliness or agedness of her Com∣panions. One must never run the risque of being incommoded side-ways, nor doe honour to others at the expence of ones own Reputation. It is good to frequent the society of eminent persons for sha∣ping ones self: but when one is comple∣ted, to strike in with those of inferiour size. To model thy self, chuse the most complete; and when thou art fashioned, frequent the inferiour. MAXIME CLIII. To shun being obliged to fill the place of a great Man. If one engage in that, he ought to be sure to exceed him. For to equal a Pre∣decessour, one must have double his
worth. As it requires Prudence and skill in him that succeeds, to be such, as that he may be regrated: so likewise does it Art, that he may have a care not to be eclipsed by him that went before him. It is very difficult to fill up a great vacancy, seeing commonly the first appears the best: and by consequent equality is not enough, because the former is in possession. It is therefore necessary to surpass him, to dispossess him of the advantage he hath of being most esteemed. MAXIME CLIV. Not to be easie neither to believe, nor to love. It's an argument of maturity of judg∣ment, to be hard to believe. Nothing is more common than to lie, to believe then, ought to be extraordinary. He who is apt to move, finds himself often put out of countenance. But special care is to be had not to seem to doubt the credit of another: for that passes from incivility to an offence, seeing it is to reckon him either a deceiver, or decei∣ved: nor is all the hurt there neither. For, besides that, not to believe is the sign of a liar, the liar being subject to
two misfortunes, not to believe, and not to be believed. A suspension of judg∣ment in him that hears, is laudable: but he that speaks may refer to his Authour. It is also a kind of imprudence to be easie to love. For if one lie in speech, one may also lie in fact: and that cheat is more pernicious than the other. MAXIME CLV. The Art of restraining Passions. Let a prudent reflexion prevent, if it be possible, the usual transports of the vulgar. That will be no difficult thing to a prudent man. The first step to mo∣deration, is to perceive that we are fal∣ling into passion. By that means we en∣ter the lists with a full power over our selves, and may examine how far it is necessary to give way to our resentment. With that swaying reflexion, we may be angry, and put a stop to it as we please. Strive to know where and when it is fit to stop. For it is the hardest thing in running to stop upon the spot. It is a great mark of judgment to stand firm and undisturbed amidst the Sallies of pas∣sion. Every excess of passion degene∣rates from reason. But with this ma∣gisterial
circumspection, Reason will ne∣ver be disordered, nor transgress the bounds of its duty. To be able to de∣vour a passion, we must always hold the reins fast. He who governs himself in this manner, will be reckoned the wisest man; as the foolishest if he do otherwise. MAXIME CLVI. Friends by Election. Friends ought to abide the test of dis∣cretion, and the trial of fortune. It is not enough that they have had the suffrage of the will, if they have not also that of the understanding. Though that be the most important point of life, yet there is least care taken about it. Some make their Friends by the intervention of others, and most part by chance. We judge of men by the Friends he hath. A knowing man never chose ignorants. But though a man may please, we must not there∣fore say that he is an intimate Friend. For that may proceed rather from the pleasantness of his humour and ways, than from any assurance that one hath of his capacity. There are lawfull Friend∣ships, and bastard Friendships. These are for pleasure; but the others for more
security in acting. There are few friends of the person, but many of the fortune. The good wit of a Friend is better than all the good will of others. Take thy Friends then by choice, and not by lot. A prudent Friend eases many troubles: whereas one who is not so, multiplies and encreases them. If thou would'st not lose thy Friends, never wish them a great Fortune. MAXIME CLVII. Not to be mistaken in People. That is the worst, and yet most ordi∣nary mistake. It is better to be deceived in the Price, than in the Commodity: And there is nothing that one ought more narrowly to look into. There is a great deal of difference betwixt knowing of things, and knowing of persons: and it is quaint Philosophy, to discern the minds and humours of men. It is as necessary to study them, as to study Books. MAXIME CLVIII. To know how to use Friends. That's a thing that requires great skill.
Some are good to be made use of at a di∣stance; and others to be near us. One that hath not been fit for Conversation, may be good for Correspondence. Di∣stance effaces some certain defects, which presence rendered unsupportable. In Friends we are not onely to look for plea∣sure, but for profit also. A Friend ought to have the three qualities of a Being, or as the Schools say of an Ens: Unity, Goodness, and Truth: in respect that a Friend stands in stead of all things. There are but very few that can be given for good: and by not knowing how to chuse them, the number becomes less. To know how to preserve them, is more than to have been able to make them. Look out for such as may continue long: and though in the beginning they may be new, it is enough to content thee, that they may become old. To take things aright, those are the best, which are not acquired, till we have eat a bushel of Salt with them. There is no such horrid a Desart, as to live without Friends. Friend∣ship multiplies blessings, and divides cros∣ses. It is the onely remedy against bad Fortune. It is the vent by which the Soul discharges it self.
MAXIME CLIX. To know how to bear with Fools. Wise Men have always been bad-suffe∣rers. Impatience grows with knowledge. A vast reach is hard to be contented. In the judgment of Epictetus, the best Maxime of life is to Suffer. He hath placed one half of Wisedom in that. If all imper∣tinences are to be born with, without doubt there is need of much patience. Sometimes we suffer most from those on whom we depend most; and that serves to exercise us to patience. From suffe∣ring, springs that inestimable peace, which makes the happiness of this world. Let him that finds not himself in a humour to suffer, withdraw, if he be able to bear with himself. MAXIME CLX. To speak sparingly to our Competitours for Caution sake, and to others for Civility. One hath always time to let slip his words, but not to retain them. We ought to speak as men do in their last Wills, seeing the fewer the words are,
the less will be the Law suits. We are to accustome our selves to that, in mat∣ters of no importance, that we may not fail in it, when it is important. Silence holds much of Divinity. Whosoever is ready to speak, is always upon the point of being cast and Convicted. MAXIME CLXI. To know the failings wherein one takes pleasure. The most accomplished man hath al∣ways some, whereof he is either the Hus∣band or Gallant. They are to be found in the wit, and the greater that is, the greater, and more remarkable are they: not but that he who has them, knows them; but because he loves them. To be passionate, and to be passionate for vices, are two evils. These faults are the blemishes of perfection. They as much offend those who see them as they please those who have them. Here is the fair occasion for one to overcome him∣self, and to put the cap-stone upon his other perfections. Every one levels at that work, and in stead of praising all that is to be admired, stop short to Cen∣sure a fault, which, as they say, disfigures all the rest.
MAXIME CLXII. To be able to triumph over Jealousie and Envy. Though it be Prudence to slight Envy, yet that contempt is a small matter now a-days: Gallantry works a far better ef∣fect. He cannot be sufficiently praised, who speaks well of him, that speaks ill. There is not any revenge more Heroick, than that which torments Envy, by doing good. Every good success is a strapado for the envious man, and the glory of his Corrival is a Hell to him. To make ones happiness to be a poison to his En∣viers, is held to be the most rigorous punishment that they can endure. En∣viers die as often as they hear the praises of the Envied revive. Both contend for immortality, but the one to live always in glory, and the other always in misery. The Trumpet of Fame, which sounds to immortalize the one, pronounces death to the other, by condemning him to the punishment of expecting in vain that the cause of his pains should cease.
MAXIME CLXIII. One must never lose the favour of him that is happy, to take compassion on a Wretch. Commonly that which makes the hap∣piness of some, makes the misery of o∣thers: and you may see one that could not be happy, if many others were not miserable. It is the property of wretches to gain peoples good will. For all take pleasure to gratifie with an unprofitable favour, those who are persecuted by For∣tune. Nay it hath sometimes happened that a man hated of all the world in his prosperity, hath been pitied by all people in his misfortune; the fall having chan∣ged into compassion the desire of revenge. Let a man of wit then take heed of the turns of Fortune. There are some that never associate but with the unfortunate. He, whom they shunned yesterday be∣cause of his prosperity, has them for Companions to day, because of his ad∣versity. That Conduct is sometimes the mark of a good nature, but never of a good wit.
MAXIME CLXIV. To let fly some shot in the Air. Is the way to know how that which is intended to be done, will be received, especially, when they are matters, the issue and approbation whereof is doubt∣full. By that means we are sure to hit our mark, and always at liberty to re∣treat or advance. Thus we pump out mens minds, and know where it is best to set our foot. That prevention is most necessary, for asking pertinently, placing Friendship aright, and for governing well. MAXIME CLXV. To wage War fairly. A brave man may, indeed, be induced to make War, but not to make it other∣wise than he ought. All men ought to act according to what they themselves are, and not to what others are. Gal∣lantry is most plausible, when it is used towards an Enemy. We are not onely to overcome by force, but also by the manner. To Conquer basely is not to overcome, but to be Conquered rather.
Generosity hath always had the advan∣tage. A worthy man never makes use of forbidden Weapons. To employ the wrack of an old Friendship, in framing a new hatred, is to use such arms. For it is not lawfull to take the advantage of a trust and confidence in revenge. What∣ever looks like treachery infects the good name. The least atome of baseness is in∣consistent with the generosity of great Souls. A brave man ought to make it his glory to be such, that if gallantry, generosity and fidelity, were lost in the world, they might be found in his heart. MAXIME CLXVI. To distinguish betwixt the man of Words, and the man of Deeds. This distinction is as absolutely necessa∣ry as that of the friend of the person, and the friend of the employment. For they are very different friends. He is out of the way, who doing no bad Deeds, gives no good Words: And he again more, who giving no bad Words, does no good Deeds. Now a-days men feed not upon words, seeing they are but wind; nor do they live on Civilities, these being onely a formal juggle. To
go a birding with a light, is the true way to dazle the birds eyes. The vain and fools are content with wind. Words ought to be the pledges of actions, and by consequent have their value. Trees that bear no fruit, and have onely leaves, have commonly no heart. It is necessary to know them all; the one, to make pro∣fit of them; and the other, to stand under their shade. MAXIME CLXVII. To be able to help ones self. In troublesome encounters, there is no better company than a great heart: and if this come to fail, it ought to be assisted by the parts that are about it. Crosses are not so great for those who can tell how to assist themselves. Yield not to Fortune. For she'll become insupportable to thee. Some give themselves so little help in their troubles, that they increase them, because they know not how to bear them with courage. He that un∣derstands himself well, finds in reslexion relief to his weakness. A man of judg∣ment comes off in all things advantage∣ously, were it even to come down from the stars.
MAXIME CLXVIII. Not to be Monstrous. All the Hair-brained, Vain, Opinionative, Capricious, Self-conceited, Extravagant, Fawners, Buffoons, News-mongers, Au∣thours of Paradoxes, Phanaticks, and in a word, all sorts of irregular persons: all these, I say, are so many Monsters of im∣pertinence. The ugliness of the Soul is al∣ways more monstrous, than the defor∣mity of body, seeing it more dishonours the beauty of its original. But who shall correct so great and general a disorder? where reason is wanting, direction has nothing to doe: inasmuch as that which ought to be the cause of a serious reflexion upon that which gives occasion to pub∣lick laughter, makes men fall into the vanity of believing, they are admired. MAXIME CLXIX. To take more heed not to miss once, than to hit an hundred times. When the Sun shines no body minds him; but when he is eclipsed, all consider him. The vulgar will keep no account
of your hits, but of your misses. The bad are more known by murmurings, than the good by applauses: and many have not been known untill they fell. All good successes put together are not enough to obliterate one bad one. Un∣deceive thy self then, and take it for a certain truth, that Envy will observe all thy faults, but not one of thy good acti∣ons. MAXIME CLXX. To be sparing in all things. That's the way to succeed in matters of importance. One must not at every turn employ all his Capacity, nor shew all his strength. One must be sparing even in knowledge: for that serves to double the value of it. There is a neces∣sity of having always something to trust to, when the question is how to get out of the mire. The relief is more conside∣rable than the fight, because it is always accompanied with the reputation of va∣lour. Prudence keeps always to the su∣rer side. And in that sense the ingenious Paradox is true: That the half is more than the whole.
MAXIME CLXXI. Not to abuse Favour. Great Friends are for great occasions. Much favour is not to be employed in matters of small importance: that's scat∣tering of it. The sheet Anchor is always reserved for the last extremity. If we squander away the much for the little, what will remain for the next need? There is nothing now a-days better than Protectours, nor more precious than fa∣vour. It does and undoes, even so far as to give wit, and take it. Fortune hath always been as much a Step-mother to the Wise, as Nature and Fame have been favourable unto them. It's better to know how to preserve our Friends, than our Estates. MAXIME CLXXII. Never to engage with him that hath no∣thing to lose. To doe otherwise, is to fight at a disad∣vantage. For the other enters the lists unconcernedly. Seeing he hath lost all shame, he hath no more to lose, nor to
husband; and so he runs hand over head into all extravagances. Reputation, which is an inestimable value, ought never to be exposed to so great risques. Having cost a great many years in purchasing, it comes to be lost in a moment. A small breeze of wind is enough to freeze a great deal of sweat. A Prudent Man is with∣held by the consideration that he hath much to lose. When he thinks of his Reputation, he presently considers the danger of losing it. And by means of that reflexion he proceeds with so great reserve, that Prudence has time to retire in time, and to secure his Credit. One can never be able to recover by a Victory what he hath already lost in exposing himself to lose. MAXIME CLXXIII. Not to be a Glass in Conversation, and much less in Friendship. Some are easie to break, and thereby discover their insolidity. They fill them∣selves with discontent, and others with distate. They shew themselves to be tenderer than the Eyes, because they are not to be touched neither in jest nor earnest. Motes even offend them; (for
they have no need of Apparitions.) They who keep them company, ought to put an extreme constraint upon themselves, and study to observe all their nicities. There is no stirring before them, for the least gesture disturbs them. Commonly they are a self-abounding kind of people, slaves to their humour, and Idolatours of their silly point of honour, for which they would turn the world topsie-turvey. He that truly loves, is of the nature of a Diamond, both as to its lastingness, and its being hard to break. MAXIME CLXXIV. Not to live too fast. To know how to distribute time, is to know how to enjoy life. To many there is much of life remaining, but they want the felicity of it. They lavish away pleasures: (for they enjoy them not,) and when they are gone on a great way, they would be willing, if they could, to come back again. These are the Postil∣lions of life, who to the swift motion of time, add the rapidity of their own minds. They would devour in one day what hardly they could be able to digest in all their life time. They live in plea∣sures
as men that would taste of them all before hand. They eat up future years, and seeing they doe all things in haste, they have soon done with all. The desire of knowledge it self ought to be moderated, that we may not know things imperfect∣ly. There are more days than prosperi∣ties. Make haste to doe, and enjoy at leisure. It is better to have affairs done than to doe, and the contentment which lasts, is to be preferred before that which ends. MAXIME CLXXV. The substantial Man. He that is so, is not satisfied with those who are not so. Unhappy is that emi∣nence that hath nothing substantial in it. All who appear to be men, are not all so. There are some artificial men, that con∣ceive Chimera's, and are brought to bed of mistakes. There are others that re∣semble them, and set a value upon them, being better satisfied with the uncertainty that a false shew promises, because the much is there; than with the certainty that offers truth, because that appears lit∣tle: but at long run their Caprices come to an unlucky end, inasmuch as they
have no solid foundation. Nothing but truth can give a true Reputation; and nothing but substance turns to account. One cheat stands in need of a great many others, and by consequent, the whole building is but imaginary: and seeing it is founded in the air, it must of necessity fall to the ground. An ill conceived de∣sign never comes to maturity. The much which it promises, is enough to render it suspected: just so as the argument which proves too much, proves nothing. MAXIME CLXXVI. To know, or to hearken to those who know. There is no living without understan∣ding, it must be had, either by nature, or at second hand. Yet there are some, who are ignorant that they know no∣thing; and others, who think they know, though they know nothing at all. The faults that proceed from the want of wit, are incurable. For as ignorants know not themselves, so they take no care to search for that they want. Some would be wise, if they did think themselves so. Hence it is that the Oracles of Wise∣dom be so rare, yet they have nothing to doe, seeing no body consults them. It is
neither a diminution of Grandeur, nor a sign of incapacity to take Counsel: on the contrary, one puts himself in the state of a knowing man by advising well. De∣bate with thy Reason, that thou mayst not be beaten by ill fortune. MAXIME CLXXVII. To avoid too much familiarity in Conver∣sation. It is neither pertinent to practise it, nor to suffer it. He that familiarizes himself, presently loses the Superiority that his serious air gave him, and by consequent his Credit. The stars retain their splen∣dour, because they mingle not with us. By Divinizing, one gets Respect, by Hu∣manizing, Contempt. The more com∣mon humane things are, the less they are esteemed. For communication discovers imperfections, that reservedness concea∣led. We must not be too familiar with any body;) not with Superiours, because of danger; nor with inferiours, by reason of Indecency: and far less with mean people whom ignorance renders insolent, inasmuch that being unsensible of the ho∣nour that is done them, they presume it is their due. Facility is a branch of a low mind.
MAXIME CLXXVIII. To believe the Heart, and especially if it be a presaging Heart. It is never to be contradicted: for it is accustomed to prognosticate what most concern us. It is a Domestick Oracle. Many have perished, because they were too diffident of themselves. But to what end should one distrust himself, if he look not out for the remedy? Some have a heart that tells them every thing: a cer∣tain mark of a rich stock. For that heart always prevents them, and rings the allarum Bell upon the approach of evils, to make them fly to the remedy. It is not the part of a wise man to go out and receive evils, but to be before-hand with them and disperse them. MAXIME CLXXIX. To be reserved in speaking, is the Seal of the Capacity. A Heart without secrecy is an open letter. Where there is depth, the secrets are deep. For there must be much room and large spaces, where all that is thrown
in may be easily kept. Reservation pro∣ceeds from the great command that one hath over himself, and that is, indeed, a real triumph. We pay tribute to as ma∣ny as we discover our selves to. The se∣curity of Prudence consists in internal moderation. The snares that are laid for discretion, are to contradict, to draw out an explanation; and to glance biting words, to set one in a flame. Then it is that a Wise Man ought to keep the closer! Things that are to be done, are not to be told; nor are those that are fit to be told, good to be done.) See the Maxime 279. MAXIME CLXXX. Not to take the design of an Enemy for the rule of our Measures. A Blockhead will never doe what a man of Wit thinks he should, because he is not able to discern what is to the purpose. And if he be a prudent man, less still; because he may go contrary to an advice that has been blow'd upon, and perhaps even prevented by his adversary. Mat∣ters ought to be examined on both sides, and prepared for pro and con: so that one may be ready for the yea and the no. Judgments are different. Indifference
ought always to be attentive, not so much for what shall happen, as for what may happen. MAXIME CLXXXI. Not to tell a lie, and yet not to speak all the truth neither. Nothing requires more circumspection than truth. For to tell it, is to draw the hearts bloud. There needs as much skill to know when to tell it, as to know when to conceal it. By on single lie, a man loses all his good name. Deceit goes for false Coin, and the Deceiver for a Coiner, which is worse still. All truths cannot be told: some, because they concern my self; and others, because they concern a third person. MAXIME CLXXXII. A grain of boldness is worth a pound weight of skill. It is good not to conceive such a high notion of people, as to become bashfull in their presence. Let never the imagi∣nation debase the heart. Some appear to be men of importance, till others treat with them; but communication soon un∣deceives
the Credulous. No body goes beyond the narrow bounds of man. Eve∣ry one hath his if, some as to their Wit; and others as to their Genius. Dignity gives an apparent Authority; but it is rare, when the personal qualities answer it. For fortune is wont to clog the Su∣periority of the employment, by the in∣feriority of merits. Imagination is al∣ways upon the wing, and represents things greater than they are: It conceives not onely what there is, but what there may be also: Reason having been unde∣ceived by so many experiences, ought to undeceive it. In a word, it neither be∣comes ignorance to be bold, nor capacity to be bashfull. And if Confidence be use∣full to them who have but a small stock, upon stronger reason it ought to be use∣full to those who have a great deal. MAXIME CLXXXIII. Not to be Head-strong. All Fools are Opiniatours, and all Opi∣niatours are Fools. The more Erroneous their Opinions are, the more they hug them. It is civil to yield, even in those things wherein we have greatest reason and certainty: for then all know, who
had reason on their side: and besides the reason, Gallantry is also discovered in the procedure. There is more esteem lost, by a wilfull resistence, then there is got by car∣rying it by open force. For that is not so much a defending of truth, as a demonstrati∣on of Clownishness. There are knotty heads very difficult to be cleft, and which al∣ways run upon some incurable extremity: and when once whimsey joins to their head-strongness, they contract an indisso∣luble league with extravagance. Inflexi∣bility ought to be in the will, and not in the judgment: though there be excepted cases too, wherein one is not to suffer himself to be gained, nor doubly over∣come; that's to say, both in the reason, and in the execution. MAXIME CLXXXIV. Not to be Ceremonious. The affectation of being so was here∣tofore censured as a piece of vitious sin∣gularity, and that in a King too. Punc∣tiliousness is tiresome. There are whole Nations sick of that Nicety. The robe of silliness is wrought with small stitch. These Idolatours of the point of honour give a demonstration, that their honour
is founded on a small matter, seeing they fansie every thing may wound it. It is good so to carry, as to gain Respect, but it is ridiculous to pass for a great Master of Compliments. It is very true, that a Man without Ceremony hath need of a great Merit in place of it. Courtesie ought neither to be affected nor slighted. He shall never gain the esteem of an able man, who sticks too much upon Forma∣lities. MAXIME CLXXXV. Never to expose ones Credit to the risque of one single interview. For if one come not well of, it is an irreparable loss. To fail once happens often, and especially the first time. One is not always in the kue; whence cometh the Proverb: It is not my day. One must therefore endeavour; that if he hath failed the first time, the second may make amends for all: or that the first may vouch for the second, that succeeded not. One ought always to have his recourse to better, and to appeal from much to more. Affairs depend on certain fortui∣tous cases, and on many too: and by con∣sequence good success is a rare good for∣tune.
MAXIME CLXXXVI. To discern faults, though they be in fashion. Though Vice be cloathed in cloth of gold, yet a good man will still know it. It is to no purpose for it to be apparelled in gold, it can never so well disguise it self but that it will be perceived to be of iron. It would cloak it self with the no∣bility of its Adherents, but it is never stript of its baseness, nor the misery of its slavery. Vices may very well be exalted, but not exalt. Some observe, that such a Heroe hath had such a Vice, but they consider not, that it was not that Vice which made him a Heroe. The example of great men is so good an Oratour, that it persuades one to infamous matters. Sometimes flattery hath affected even bo∣dily defects, without observing, that though they be born with in great men, they are insupportable in the mean. MAXIME CLXXXVII. To act all that is agreeable to ones self, and all that's odious by others. The one conciliates good will, and the
other banishes hatred. There is more pleasure in doing good, than in receiving it. It's in that, that generous Souls place their felicity. It seldome happens that one vexes another without being troubled himself, either through compassion or re∣taliation. Superiour causes never ope∣rate, without reaping praise or reward. Let the good come immediately from thee; and the evil by another. Take some body, upon whom the blows of discontent may fall, that's to say the ha∣tred and the murmurings. The anger of the Rabble is like that of Dogs; not knowing the cause of its evil, it falls up∣on the Instrument. So that the instru∣ment bears the punishment of the evil whereof it is not the principal cause. MAXIME CLXXXVIII. To bring always into company something to be praised. That's a means to make one esteem∣ed a man of good discerning, and upon whose judgment one may be assured of the goodness of things. He that hath known the perfection before, will be sure to esteem it afterwards. He furnishes matter to conversation
and imitation, by unfolding plausible knowledges. It is a politick way of selling Courtesie to those that are pre∣sent, who have the same perfections. Others on the contrary bring always with them something to be blamed, and flatter the present, by despising the absent. This succeeds with them, when they are in the company of those who onely look on the outside: seeing such observe not the cun∣ning of speaking ill of some in presence of others. Some think it a piece of Po∣licy to esteem more the ordinary perfec∣tions of to day, than the wonders of yesterday. A Prudent Man then is to have a care of all these Artifices, (where∣by these blades endeavour to attain to their ends) that he may not be discoura∣ged by the exaggeration of the one, nor puffed up by the flattery of the others. Let him know, that both proceed the same way with both parties, and onely give them the alternative, by adjusting their sentiments to the place where they are. MAXIME CLXXXIX. To make use of the needs of others. If privation come the length of desire,
it is the most efficacious constraint. Phi∣losophers have said, that privation was nothing, and the Politicians say, that it's all in all. And without doubt these have best understood it. There are some who to obtain their ends, make their way by the desire of others. They lay hold of occasion, and stir up the desire by the difficulty of obtaining. They promise themselves more from the heat of passion, than from the lukewarmness of possession. Insomuch that the desire enflames the more as the resistence grows greater. The true secret of attaining to ones ends is, to keep people always in dependence. MAXIME CXC. To be satisfied in all conditions. Even they who are useless, have the consolation that they are eternal. There is no trouble but hath its satisfaction. Luck for the fools, and chance for the ugly, saith the Proverb. To live long, there needs no more but to be of little worth. The crackt pot seldom breaks, it lasts commonly till people be weary of using it. It would seem that fortune envies men of importance, seeing it joins dura∣tion with incapacity in some, and short
life to much merit in others. All they who by right ought to live, always fail in good fortune: and such as are good for nothing, you'll find to be eternal, whe∣ther because they appear to be so, or be∣cause in effect they are so. It seems that destiny and death are agreed to forget the unfortunate. MAXIME CXCI. Not to be gull'd with excessive Courtesie. For it's a kind of Cheat. There are some who stand not in need of the herbs of Thessaly to bewitch with, for they charm fools and vain people merely with a low Bow. They make a Traffick of Honour, and pay for it with the wind of some fair words. He that promises all promises nothing, and promises are so many slippery steps for fools. True Courtesie is a debt, that which is affected and uncommon, is a Cheat. It is not a civility, but a dependance. They make not the Bow to the Person, but to the Fortune. Their flattery is not an acknow∣ledgment of merit, but a bait to the pro∣fit, which they hope for. See the Maxime 118.
MAXIME CXCII. The peaceable man is the long lived man. Live, and let live. Peacefull men not onely live but reign. We must hear and see, but withal, hold our peace. The day spent without contention, makes us spend the night in sleep. To live much, and to live with pleasure, is the life of two: and it is the fruit of internal peace. That man hath all, who does not at all care for what concerns him not. There is nothing more impertinent, than to lay to heart that which touches us not, or not to be affected with that which con∣cerns us. MAXIME CXCIII. Watch strictly over him that engages in thy interests, to come off with his own. There is no better preservative against Cunning, than Caution. A word to the wise. Some doe their own business by seeming to doe another man's. So that if one have not the key of intentions, he is forced at every turn to burn his own fin∣gers, to save other men's goods from the fire.
MAXIME CXCIV. To have a modest Opinion of ones self, and of his affairs, especially when he does but begin the world. All People have high Conceits of them∣selves, and especially they who signify least. Every one fansies to himself a brave Fortune, and imagines himself to be a Prodigy. Hope engages rashly, and then experience seconds it in nothing. Reality is the executioner of a vain ima∣gination by undeceiving it. Prudence then ought to correct such extravagances: and though it be allowable to desire the best, yet we ought always to expect the worst, that so we may take all that hap∣pens patiently. It is dexterity to take ones aim a little higher, that he may hit the juster, but he ought not to shoot so high, as to fail at the first shot. That reformation of imagination is necessary, for vanity without experiences makes men onely to dote. A good understan∣ding is the most universal remedy against all impertinences. Let every one know the sphere of his own activity, and condi∣tion. That will teach a man to square the opinion of himself according to reality.
MAXIME CXCV. To be able to judge. There is no man but may be another's Master in some thing. He that exceeds, finds always some body that exceeds him. To know how to pick out the best of every thing, is a usefull knowledge. The Wise Man esteems all men, because he knows what's good in every one, and what things cost in doing of them well. The Fool despises all, in respect that he is ignorant of what is good, and always chuses the worst. MAXIME CXCVI. To know ones Planet. There is no man so miserable, but that he hath his Planet: and if he be unfortu∣nate, it is because he knoweth it not. Some have access to Princes, and great Men, and know neither how, nor why; unless it be that their luck hath made way for them. So that they need onely a little industry to preserve favour. There are others born as it were to please the Wise. One man hath been more accep∣table
in one Countrey than another, and better received in this City than in that. One man happens also to be more fortunate in one employment, than in all others, though he be neither more nor less capable of all. Destiny makes and unmakes how and when it pleases. Eve∣ry one then ought to labour to know his Destiny, and to try his Minerva; on which depends all the loss and all the gain. Let him know how to comply with his fate, and take good heed he attempt not to change it. For that would be to for∣sake the North-star in his course. MAXIME CXCVII. Never to be hampered with Fools. It is a perplexity not to know them, and much more for him that knows them not to rid his hands of them. It is dan∣gerous to keep them Company, and per∣nicious to admit them to our Confidence. For though their own timerousness, and the Eye of another may for some time keep them in awe, yet their extravagance will break out at long-run, seeing they have onely deferred the shewing of it, that they might doe it with more solem∣nity. It is very difficult for him that can∣not
keep his own Credit, to maintain another Man's. Besides, Fools are ex∣tremely unhappy. For misery is fastened to impertinence, as the skin to the bone. They have onely one thing that is not so very bad. And that is, that as the Wise∣dom of others signifies nothing to them, so on the contrary, they are very usefull to the Wise, whom they instruct and cau∣tion at their own proper cost. MAXIME CXCVIII. To know how to transplant ones self. There are some, who, to set off their own value, are obliged to change Coun∣tries, especially if they aspire to great places. Ones Countrey is the Step-mother to eminent Qualities. Envy reigns there as in its Native Land. Men remember better the imperfections that one had in the beginning, than the merit, whereby he is advanced to grandeur. A Pin hath been esteemed a thing of value, when car∣ried from one world into another: and sometimes a glass brought from a-far, hath made a Diamond to be undervalued. E∣very thing that is foreign, is esteemed, whether because it comes from a far Coun∣trey; or because it is found to be com∣plete,
and in its perfection. We have seen men who have been the refuse of a little Canton, and are now the honour of the World, being equally reverenced by their Countrey-men and Strangers; by the one, because they are far off, and by the others, because they are come from a-far. He will never have great venera∣tion for a Statue, who hath seen it the stump of a Tree in a Garden. MAXIME CXCIX. To be a Wise Man, and not an intrieguing Man. The shortest way to attain to Reputa∣tion, is the way of merit. If industry be founded on merit, it is the true way of obtaining it. Integrity alone is not sufficient; and the onely Intrieguer de∣serves it not: inasmuch that matters are then so defective, that they infect the Re∣putation. It is then requisite both to have merit, and to know how to bring ones self into play.
MAXIME CC. To have always something still to desire, that one may not be unhappy in his happiness. The body breaths, and the mind as∣pires. If one enjoyed all things, he would be disgusted with every thing. Nay, it is even necessary for the satisfac∣tion of the understanding, that there re∣main always something to be known, for feeding Curiosity. Hope gives life, and the glut of pleasure makes the life a bur∣then. In matter of reward, it is prudent not to give it all at once. When there is no more to be desired, every thing is to be feared: and that is an unhappy felici∣ty. Fear beginneth where desire endeth. MAXIME CCI. All who appear Fools, are so, and one half also of those who appear not to be. Folly hath taken possession of this World, and if there be the least wisedom in it, it is more folly in respect of the wisedom from above. But the greatest Fool is he that thinks himself wise, and
accuses all others of folly. To be wise, it is not sufficient to seem so, and far less to seem so to ones self. He is so, that thinks not himself to be so: and he who perceives not, that others see, sees not himself. Though the world be so full of Fools and Blockheads, yet no body be∣lieves himself to be one, nor so much as suspects it. MAXIME CCII. Sayings and Actions render a Man accom∣plished. We must speak well, and act well. The one shews a good head, and the other a good heart: and both spring from a supe∣riority of mind. (Words are the shadow of actions. Saying is the Female, and doing the Male. It is better to be the sub∣ject of a Panegyrick, than the Panegyrist. It is better to receive praises, than to give them. To say is easie; but to doe, diffi∣cult. Brave actions are the substance of life, and good sayings the ornament of it. The excellence of actions is permanent, that of words transient.) Actions are the fruit of reslexions. Some are wise, others valiant.
MAXIME CCIII. To know the Excellencies of ones Age. They are not very numerous. There is but one Phoenix in the world. Hardly is there to be found in an age a great Ge∣neral, a perfect Oratour, a Sage. And an excellent King is to be lookt for in many ages. Mediocrities are common, both for number, and for esteem: but Ex∣cellencies are every way rare, because they require an accomplished perfection: and the higher the form, the harder it is to get to be Captain of it. Many have usurped the Sirname of Great from Caesar and Alexander, but all in vain. For with∣out the actions, the voice of the people is but a little air. There have been but few Seneca's, and Fame hath celebrated but one Apelles. MAXIME CCIV. What is easie ought to be set about, as if it were difficult; and what is difficult as if it were easie. The one for fear of slackening through too much confidence; and the other for
fear of losing courage through too much apprehensiveness. The way to fail in doing of a thing, is to reckon it already done: on the contrary, diligence sur∣mounts impossibility. As to great enter∣ptizes, we must not stand reasoning, it is enough that we embrace them when they present, lest the consideration of their difficulty make us abandon the at∣tempt. MAXIME CCV. To know how to make use of Contempt. The true secret for obtaining the things which one desires, is to undervalue them. Commonly they are not to be found when they are sought: whereas they offer themselves, when one cares not for them. As the things of this World are the shadow of those in Heaven, so have they that property of a shadow, that they fly from him that follows them, and pursue him who flies from them. Contempt also is the most politick re∣venge. It's the general Maxime of the wise, never to defend themselves with the Pen, because it leaves tracts, that turn more to the glory of their Enemies, than to their humiliation. Besides that, that
kind of defence gives more honour to envy, than mortification to insolence. It's cunning in inconsiderable persons to vie with great men, that they may get themselves Credit by an indirect way, when they cannot have it by right. (Ma∣ny men had never been known, if excel∣lent Adversaries had not taken notice of them.) There is no higher revenge, than Oblivion. For it is the burying of these men under the dust of their own nullity. Rash blades imagine to purchase to them∣selves an eternal fame, by setting fire to the Wonders of the world, and ages. The art of repressing Calumny, is, not to mind it. To answer it, is, to doe prejudice to ones self. To be offended thereat, is, to discredit ones self, and to give envy ground of satisfaction. For there needs no more but that shadow of defect, if not for obscuring a perfect beauty entire∣ly, at least for depriving it of its liveliest lustre. MAXIME CCVI. We must know that the vulgar humour is every where. Even at Corinth, and in the most ac∣complished Family. Every one hath the
experience of it in his own house. There is not onely a vulgar, but a doubly vul∣gar humour, which is worse. This hath the same properties with the Rabble, just so as the pieces of a broken Looking-glass have all the same transparency: but it is far more dangerous. It speaks foo∣lishly, and censures impertinently. It is the great Disciple of ignorance, the God∣father of silliness, and the near Cosin of quacking. (We must not mind what it says, and far less what it thinks. It is convenient to know it, that we may get rid of it, so that we be neither it's com∣panion nor object. For all silliness is of the nature of the Rabble, and the vulgar is onely made up of Fools. MAXIME CCVII. To use Retention. We ought to mind what we doe, espe∣cially on unexpected occasions. The eruptions of Passions are so many slippe∣ry places that make Prudence to slide. There lies the danger of being undone. A man engages farther in a minute of rage or pleasure, than in many hours of indifference. Sometimes a little pelting fret costs a repentance, that lasts as long
as life. Other men's Malice lays ambushes for Prudence, that it may discover foot∣ing. It makes use of that kind of rack, for extorting the most hidden secret of the heart. Retention then must raise the counter-battery, and particularly on hot occasions. There needeth much re∣flexion to keep a Passion in order. He is a wise man that leads it by the Bri∣dle. Who knows there is danger, counts his steps. A word seems as offensive to him that catches at it, and weighs it, as it appears of little consequence to him that spake it. MAXIME CCVIII. Not to die the death of a Fool. Wise Men die commonly poor in Wise∣dom: on the contrary, Fools die rich in Council. To die like a Fool, is to die of too much Logick. Some die, because they feel, and others live because they feel not. So that the one are Fools, be∣cause they die not of feeling, and the others because they die of it. That man is a fool, who dies of too much under∣standing. So that some die to be Ʋn∣derstanding Men, and other's live, not to be understood. But though many die like Fools, yet very few Fools die.
MAXIME CCIX. Not to imitate the folly of others. Is an effect of rare wisedome; for whatever is introduced by example and custome, is of great force. Some who have guarded against particular ignorance, have not been able to avoid the general. It's a common saying, that no man is con∣tent with his own condition, though it be the best: nor dissatisfied with his wit, though it be the worst. Every one en∣vies the happiness of another, because he is not content with his own. Modern men praise ancient things, and those that are here, things that are there. All that's past seems best, and all that's remote is most esteemed. He is as great a Fool that laughs at all things, as he that vexes at every thing. MAXIME CCX. To know how to make use of truth. Truth is dangerous, but yet a good man cannot forbear to speak it. And in that there is need of art. The skilfull Physicians of the Soul have essayed all
means to sweeten it. For when it tou∣ches to the quick, it is the quintessence of bitterness. Discretion in that particu∣lar unfolds all its address: with the same truth it flatters one, and kills another. We ought to speak to those that are pre∣sent, under the name of the absent or dead. To the understanding, a sign is enough: and if that be not sufficient, the best expedient is to hold ones peace. Prin∣ces are not cured by bitter Medicines. It requires art to guild their Pill. In the third Critick of the third part of the Authours Criticon, he saith, That after many consultations about the means of recalling Truth into the world, from whence men had banished it, to put falshood in its place, it was resolved to make it up in a great quantity of Sugar, for qualifying the bitterness of it, and then to doe it over with the Powder of Amber, to take from it its strong and un∣pleasant smell. After that it should be given to men to drink in a Golden Cup, and not in a Glass, least it might be seen through it: telling them that it was an excellent liquour, brought from a-far, and more precious than Chocolate, Coffee or Sarbet. Then he adds. They began with Princes, to the end that in imitation of them all men might drink of it. But
seeing they have a very delicate smelling, they smelt the bitterness of that drink at a Leagues distance, which began to turn their stomach, and force them to vomit, &c. And in his Discreet, in the Dialogue entituled, El Buen entendedor, he brings in a Doctour, saying; to speak truth now a-days, is called brutishness and folly. And he makes answer. And therefore no body will speak it to those who are not accustomed to hear it. There remain onely now some scraps of it in the world, nor do these neither appear, but with mystery, ceremony, and circumspection. With Princes, (replies the Doctour) men always fetch a compass. It concerns them then to take good heed to that, (answers Gracian) inasmuch as the losing or gain∣ing of all lies thereby at stake. (Verity, adds the Doctour, is a Maid no less mo∣dest than beautifull: and that's the reason why she goes always veiled. But Prin∣ces then, (replyed Gracian,) ought gal∣lantly to uncover her.) It concerns them much to be good Diviners, and sharp∣sighted Linxes, that they may dive in truth, and discern falshood. The more every one studies to mutter onely the truth to them between their teeth, the more they give it them ready chewed, and easie to be digested, to the end it
may doe them the more good. At pre∣sent undeception is politick, it goes com∣monly betwixt two lights, either that it may get out of the darkness of flattery, if it meet a Fop; or that it may advance to the light of truth, if it meet with a Man of wit. MAXIME CCXI. In Heaven all is pleasure; in Hell all pain. The world being in the middle, has a share of both. We are betwixt two extremes, and so we participate of both. There is an al∣ternative of destiny, neither can all be happiness, nor all unhappiness. This world is a cypher, all alone it is of no value, joined to Heaven it is worth a great deal. It is wisedome to be indifferent as to all its changes, for Novelty moves not the wise. Our life is acted like a Play. The Catastrophy is in the last Act. The chief part then is, to end it well. MAXIME CCXII. Not to discover the mystery of ones Art. Great Masters use this Cunning, even
when they teach their Trade. One must always preserve a Superiority, and con∣tinue to be Master. There is need of Art in communicating ones Art, the source of teaching, and that of giving must never be drained. That's the means of preser∣ving Reputation and Authority. To have always somewhat that may feed ad∣miration, by advancing things still to greater perfection, is a great precept to be observed in the matter of pleasing and teaching. In all sorts of Professions, and particularly in the most sublime employ∣ments, not to be lavish of ones self, hath been a great rule for living and prevailing. MAXIME CCXIII. To know how to contradict. It is an excellent stratagem, when one can doe it, not to be engaged, but to engage. It is the onely Rack that can extort Passions. Slowness in believing is a Vomitive that brings up secrets, and a Key that can open the best lockt heart. To sound both the will and judgment, requires great dex∣terity. A slie contempt of some myste∣rious words of another's, hunts out the most impenetrable secrets, and pleasantly wheadles them to the point of the Tongue,
that they may so be caught in the toils of artifice.) The reservedness of him who stands upon his guard, makes his spy draw off to a distence: and so he disco∣vers the thought of another, which other∣wise was impenetrable. An affected Doubt is a false Key of a cunning contri∣vance, whereby Curiosity unlocks all that it hath a mind to know.) In matter of learning it is a cunning fetch in the Schollar to contradict his Master, inas∣much as it lays an obligation upon him, to labour to explain the truth with grea∣ter perspicuity and solidity.) So that mo∣derate contradiction gives him that tea∣ches occasion to teach thoroughly. MAXIME CCXIV. Of one Folly not to make two. Nothing more ordinary than after one hath committed one piece of foppery, to doe three or four more in making amends for it. One impertinence is excused by another greater. Foppishness is of the race of Lying, or this of the race of that: to make good one, there is need of a great many others. The defence of a bad Cause, hath always been worse than the Cause it self. Not to know how to
cover the evil, is a greater evil than the evil it self. The revenue of imperfecti∣ons is, to let out a great many others to Rent. The wisest man may very well fail once, but not twice; transiently, and by inadvertency, but not deliberately. See the Maxime 261. MAXIME CCXV. To have an eye over him that looks one way, and rows another. It's the stratagem of a man of business to amuse the will that he may attack it. For so soon as it is convinced it is over-come. He dissembles his intention, that he may attain to it: he puts himself in the second rank, that he may be the first in execution. He makes sure of his blow through the inadventency of his Adversary. Let not then thy atten∣tion sleep, since the intention of thine adversary is so vigilant. And if the inten∣tion be the second in dissimulation, the dis∣cerning ought to be the first in knowledge. It is an act of circumspection to find out the artifice that one makes use of, and to observe the aims he takes for hitting the ends of his intentions. Seeing he propo∣ses one thing, and pretends another, and
that he turns and winds, that he may slily reach his ends, we are to look well about us what we grant to such an one; and sometimes it will not even be amiss to let him know that we have discovered his designs. MAXIME CCXVI. To speak clearly. That shews not onely a disengagedness, but also a vivacity of wit. Some conceive well, and bring forth ill. For without light the Children of the Soul, that's to say, thoughts and expressions, cannot come into the World. There are some, much like to those pots, which hold much, and let little out: On the contra∣ray, others say more than they know. What resolution is in the will, expression is in the understanding. They are too great perfections. Clear Wits are plau∣sible; confused heads have been admired, because not understood. Sometime ob∣scurity is gracefull, to distinguish one from the Rabble. But how can others judge of what they hear, if those who speak, conceive not themselves what they say?
MAXIME CCXVII. We must neither love, nor hate for ever. Live to day with thy Friends, as with those who to morrow may be thy worst Enemies.) Seeing that is found by expe∣rience, it is very reasonable to be upon ones guard. Have a care not to give Arms to the deserters of Friendship, inas∣much as they'll fight with them more cruelly against thy self. On the contrary, in regard of thine Enemies, leave always a door open to reconciliation, to wit, that of Gallantry, which is the surest. Some∣times former revenge hath been the cause of future repentance, and the pleasure of doing evil, turns into the displeasure of having done it. MAXIME CCXVIII. To doe nothing whimsically, but every thing with circumspection. Every whimsey is an imposthume. It is the eldest son of passion, that does all things the backward way. There are some who turn every thing into a kind of skirmishing. They are Ruffians in
Conversation; and would make a triumph of every thing they doe. They know not what it is to be peacefull. In com∣manding and governing they are perni∣tious, because they turn Government in∣to a league offensive, and form a party of Enemies of those whom they ought to look upon as Children. They'll have all things go in their way, and carry every thing as the result of their Conduct. But so soon as men discover their paradoxical humour, they stand upon their guard against them; their Chimera's are flung back to them again: and by consequent they are so far from gaining their point, that they heap up to themselves vexati∣ons, every one lending a hand to their mortification. These silly people have a crackt brain, and sometimes also an un∣sound heart. The way to get rid of such Monsters, is to flie to the Antipodes, the barbarity whereof will be more suppor∣table than the fierce and haughty humour of these men. MAXIME CCXIX. Not to pass for a Crafty Man. The truth is, there is no living now a∣days without using it. But it is better to
chuse to be prudent than cunning. An open humour is agreeable to all men, but a great many love not to have it. Sin∣cerity ought not to degenerate into sim∣plicity, nor Wisedom into Artifice. Bet∣ter it is to be respected as Wise, than fea∣red as Crafty. Sincere People are loved, but deceived. It is the greatest cunning to hide that which passes for cheating. Candour flourished in the golden Age, Malice has its turn in this age of Iron. The reputation of knowing what one hath to doe, is honourable, and procures confidence; but that of being artificious, is sophistical, and begets distrust. MAXIME CCXX. To cover our selves with the Foxe's skin, when we cannot doe it with the Lyon's. [To yield to the times, is to exceed. He that compasses his design, never loses his Reputation.] Art ought to supply strength. If we cannot proceed in the King's high∣way of open force, we must take the by∣path of Artifice. Wiles are far more ex∣peditious than strength. The wise have oftener got the better of the brave, than the brave of the wise. When an enter∣prize fails, the door is open to contempt.
MAXIME CCXXI. Not to be too ready to engage, nor to en∣gage another. There are some men cut out for blun∣dering, and making others stumble against decency. They are always at the point of doing some foppery. They are very apt to jostle rudely, but they unhappily break to pieces. They don't come off for an hundred quarrels a day. Their hu∣mour being cross-grained, they contra∣dict all men in all things. Having their judgment set the wrong way, they disap∣prove every thing. It belongs onely to these great free-booters of prudence to doe nothing right, and to censure every thing as wrong. What Monsters are there in the large Countrey of imperti∣nence! MAXIME CCXXII. A reserved man is apparently a prudent man. The Tongue is a wild Beast, very hard to be chained again, when once it is let loose. It is the pulse, whereby the wise
know the disposition of the Soul. By that, intelligent men feel the motion of the heart. The mischief is, that he who ought to be the most discreet, is the least. The wise man avoids fretting and enga∣ging, and thereby shews how much he is master of himself. He acts with circum∣spection. He is a Janus in counterpoi∣sing, and an Argus in discerning. Mo∣mus might have said with better reason, that the hands wanted eyes, than that the heart needed a little window. MAXIME CCXXIII. Not to be too singular, neither through af∣fectation, nor inadvertency. Some make themselves remarkable by their singularity, that's to say, by foolish actions, which are rather faults than diffe∣rences: and as some are known to all men, by some deformity in the face; so are these by I know not what excess, that appears in their countenance. To be sin∣gular is good for nothing, unless it be to make one pass for an original imperti∣nent: which alternately provokes the scorn of some, and the bad humour of others. This Maxime being taken out of the Chap∣ter
of the Author's Discreet, entituled, La Figureria, I have thought it pertinent to in∣sert an extract of it here as a Commentary. There are, says he, many people, that serve as an object to be laughed at by others, and those are purposely so, who to distinguish themselves from other men, affect an extravagant singularity, which they observe in all their actions. You shall see a man that would give any thing he could speak from his poll, that he might not speak by the mouth, as others doe. But since that's impossible, they transform their voice, affect a little ac∣cent, invent idiomes, and lisp it sweeting∣ly, that they may be rare in every thing. They torture their palate, in depriving it of all that naturally it loves. Seeing it is common to them with the rest of Man∣kind and other Animals, they would change it by an excess of singularity, which is rather the punishment of their affectation, than the elevation of their grandeur. Sometimes they'll be pleased to drink dregs, and say it's Nectar. They leave the generous King of Liquours for Waters, which are onely pretious in their fancies; they smell of Physick, and they call them Ambrosia. Every day they invent Novelties, that they may always improve in singularity; and the truth is,
they succeed in it, since no body else finds either the goodness or relish in the Ra∣goes, which they so magnify. So that they remain all alone in their extrava∣gancy, or as others call it, impertinence. And some lives after. In Heroick acti∣ons, singularity is becoming, and no∣thing gains more veneration to great em∣ployments. Grandeur consists in the sublimity of wit, and in elevated thoughts. There is no nobility like to that of the Heart. For it never stops to Artifice. Virtue is the Character of Heroism. Dif∣ference is becoming there: Princes ought to live with so great lustre and splen∣dour, by means of their good qualities, and virtues, that, if the Stars descended from their Celestial Sphere, to come and dwell with us, they should not be more luminous than they. There are others who are not men; they affect to distin∣guish themselves by modes, and to sin∣gularize themselves by an extraordinary air. They abhor all that is in practice. They shew an antipathy against custome. They affect Antiquity, and to revive old fashions. Others in Spain wear the French habit, and in France the Spanish. Nay, there are some that go into the Countrey with a Gorget, and to court with a Band, playing so the Puppits, as
if Derision needed a Ragoe. Men ought never to give occasion of laughter to Peo∣ple of sense; nay, not so much as to Children; and nevertheless there are a great many who seem to place their whole study and care in making them∣selves ridiculous, and to be talked of by others. They'd think the day ill spent, if they signalized it not by some ridicu∣lous singularity. But how could the mirth of some be entertained without the extravagance of others? Some Vices serve as matter for others. And thus Foppishness is the food of Calumny. But if frivolous singularity in the bark, that's to say, in the outside, be a subject of laughter, what will the internal, I mean, that of the mind be? There are some men, in whom, one would say, that Na∣ture had placed all things, Wit, Judge∣ment and all, the wrong way. They affect to appear so, for fear of conforming to Custome. Unintelligible in their Rea∣soning, depraved in their Opinion, and irregular in all. For the greatest singu∣larity, without doubt, is that of the Un∣derstanding. Others cloath their capri∣ciousness with a vain Pride, lined with foppishness and folly. With that they affect in all things and all places, a star∣ched gravity. They would seem to doe
honour with a look, and favour with a word of their mouth. MAXIME CCXXIV. Never to take things against the hair, though they come that way. Every thing hath a right side and a wrong: The best thing hurts, if we take it the wrong way. On the contra∣ry the most unfitting fits, if it be taken by the handle. Many things have given trouble that would have been pleasant, if one had known the good of them. In all things there is good and bad. The skill lies in knowing how to find out the good. One and the same thing, hath its good day, and its bad. Examine it on the fairest side. We must not give the contrary reines to good and evil. Hence it is that some take pleasure in all things, and others in nothing. A good expedi∣ent against the reverse of fortune, and for living in any time, and in any employ∣ment that happens to men.
MAXIME CCXXV. To know ones prevailing fault. Every one hath one, that makes a counterpoise to his predominant perfecti∣on. And if it be backt by inclination, it rules like a Tyrant. Let one begin to to make War against it then, by declaring it: and let that be by a manifesto. For if it be known, it will be overcome; and especially if he that hath it, judge it to be as great, as it appears to others. To be master of ones self, there is need of re∣flecting upon ones self. If once that root of imperfections be pluckt out, we'll soon be able to master the rest. MAXIME CCXXVI. Attention to engage. Most part of men neither speak nor act according to what themselves are, but according to the impression of others. There is no body, but is more than suf∣ficient for persuading evil, because evil is most easily believed, even sometimes when it is incredible. The best thing we can pretend to, depends on the fancy
of others. Some are satisfied to have reason on their side: but that is not e∣nough, and by consequent, it needs to be pursued. Sometime the care of engaging costs but very little, and is worth a great deal. With words we purchase good deeds. In this great Inn of the World, there is no utencil so small, but that it may happen to be usefull once in a year: and, for all it is of so little worth, it will be very inconvenient to be without it. Every one speaks of the object according to his passion. MAXIME CCXXVII. Not to be a man of the first impression. Some espouse the first information, so that all others are but Concubines. And as falshood goes always first, so truth finds no place after. Neither the mind, nor the will, ought ever to be filled nei∣ther with the first proposition, nor the first object: which is the sign of a poor stock. Some resemble a new pot that retains always the smell of the first liquour good or bad, that hath been put into it. When that weakness comes to be known it is pernicious, because it gives advantage to the artifices of malice. They who
have bad intentions, hasten to give their tincture to credulity. A void space must be left then for revision. Let Alexander keep the other ear for the adverse party. Let a door be open for a second and third information. It's a sign of incapacity to stick to the first, nay, and a fault that borders upon head-strongness. MAXIME CCXXVIII. To have neither the report, nor reputation of being a bad Tongue. For that's to be reckoned a general scourge. Be not ingenious at the cost of another: which is more odious than pain∣full. All men revenge themselves of an evil Speaker, by speaking evil of him: and seeing he is alone, he'll be sooner overcome than the others, who are nu∣merous, can be convicted. Evil ought never to be the subject of contentment nor commentary. A detractor is eter∣nally hated, and if sometimes great men converse with him, it is more out os plea∣sure to hear his Satyres, than for any esteem they have of him. He that speaks ill, causes always more to be said of him∣self.
MAXIME CCXXIX. To know how to divide ones life, like a man of Parts. Not according as occasions present, but by foresight and choice. A life that hath no intermission, is painfull, like a long way, where there is no Inn. Variety well understood makes it happy. The first period ought to be spent in speaking with the dead. We are born to know, and to know our selves: and it is by Books that we truly learn that, and be∣come complete men. The second station is to be allotted for the living, that's to say, that we ought to see what is best in the World, and keep a register of it. [All is not to be found in one place. The uni∣versal Father hath distributed his gifts, and sometimes it hath pleased him to give a largess to the most miserable Coun∣trey. The third pause ought to be all for our selves.] The chief happiness is to Philosophize. This Maxime is taken out of the last Chapter of his Discreet, an abstract where∣of it is fit to subjoin as a Commentary to it. The Wise Man, says he, measures his life, as one that hath little and much to
live. A life without rests is a long way without Inns. Nature hath proportio∣ned the life of man according to the course of the Sun; and the four ages of life according to the four seasons of the year. The Spring of man begins in his Infancy. The flowers of it are tender, and the hopes frail. It is followed by the hot and excessive Summer of Youth, every way dangerous, because of the boyling bloud, and the frequent erup∣tions of passions. The Autumn of Man∣ly Age comes next, crowned with the ripe fruits of mind and will: and then at length the Winter of old Age, wherein the leaves of vigour fall; when the rivu∣lets of the veins freeze; Snow covers the Head, when the Hair and Teeth are gone; and when life trembles at the approaches of death. And a page after. It was a piece of celebrated wit in that gallant Person, who divided the Comedy into three days, and the voyage of life into three stations. The first he employed in speaking with the dead; the second in conversing with the living; and the third in entertaining ones self. Let us explain the riddle. I say, he gave the first term of life to Books. He read them, and that was rather a pleasure than a toil. For if one be the more a man, the more
he knows, the noblest employment will be to learn. He devoured Books, which are the food of the Soul, and the delights of the mind. It's great happiness to meet with the best on every subject. He learn't the two universal Languages, La∣tine and Spanish, which are now a-days the Keys of the World; and the five par∣ticular, to wit, the Greek, the Italian, the French, the English, and the Dutch; that he might make his profit of all the good that is celebrated in them. After that, he bequeathed himself to that Grand-mother of life, the Wife of the Mind, and the Daughter of Experience, plausible History, I mean that which de∣lights and instructs most. He began with the Ancients, and ended with the Modern, though others take the contrary course, chusing his Authours, and distin∣guishing the Times, the Dates, Centuries, and Ages; searching into the causes of the growth, fall, and revolution of Mo∣narchies, and Re-publicks; the number, order, and qualities of their Princes, their Actions in Peace and War. He walked in the delicious Gardens of Poetry, not so much to exercise himself as to play there. Yet he was not so ignorant, but that he knew how to make a verse; nor so unadvised, as to make two. Amongst
all the Poets he gave his heart to senten∣tious Horace, and his hand to subtile Martial: which was to give him the Laurel. To Poesie he joined savoury Humanity. Then he proceeded to Phi∣losophy, and beginning with Natural, he acquired the structure of the Universe, of the marvellous being of Man, of the properties of Animals, and Plants, and in fine, of the qualities of pretious Stones. But he took more pleasure in Moral Phi∣losophy, which is the food of real men, as that which gives life to Prudence: and he studied it in the Books of the Wise and Philosophers, who have compiled it to us in Sentences, Apophthegms, Emblems and Apologues. He knew both Cosmo∣graphies, the material and formal, mea∣suring the Earth and the Sea; distingui∣shing the Elevations and Climates, the four parts of the world, and in them, Provinces and Nations: that he might not be one of those Ignorants and half Beasts, who have never known what it is they tread upon. Of Astrology he knew as much as Wisedom suffers to be known, &c. In fine, he crowned his Studies by a long and serious application to the rea∣ding of Holy Scriptures, which is the most usefull, universal and pleasant study for men of judgment. So that Moral
Philosophy rendred him Prudent; Na∣tural, Knowing; History, Discreet; Poe∣try, Ingenious; Rhetorick, Eloquent; Humanity, Polite; Cosmography, Intel∣ligent; and the study of Holy Scripture, Pious and Devote. He employed the second part of his life in Travelling, which is the second happiness of a man that's curious, and ca∣pable of making good use of it. He sought and found all that was best in the world. For when we see not things, we enjoy them not fully. There is a great deal to be said betwixt what one imagines, and what he sees. He takes more plea∣sure in objects who sees them but once, than he that sees them often. The first time one is contented, at all others he is tired. The first day, a pretty thing is the pleasure of him who is the master of it; but after that, it affects him no more than that of a stranger. He saw the Courts of greatest Princes, and by con∣sequent the Prodigies of Nature and Art in Picture, Sculpture, Tapestry, Jewels, &c. He conversed with the excellentest men of the World, either in learning, or any thing else, whereby he had the means of observing, censuring, confronting, and putting the just value upon all things. He spent the third part of so fine a
life in meditating upon the much which he had read; and the more which he had seen. All that enters by the door of the senses into this Haven of the Soul, is un∣loaded at the Custom-house of the mind, where every thing is Registred. There it is that things are weighed, judged, exa∣mined, and the quintessences of truths drawn. Ripe age is designed for contem∣plation. For the more strength the Body loses, the more the Soul acquires. The balance of the superiour part rises as much, as that of the inferiour falls. At that time men judge of things in a far different manner. Maturity of age sea∣sons Reason, and tempers the Passions. From seeing, one becomes intelligent; from contemplating wise. The Crown of a Prudent Man is to be a Philosopher, by drawing from all things, in imitation of the laborious Bee, either the honey of pleasant profit, or the wax that may serve to make a Torch to undeceive him. Phi∣losophy is nothing else but a meditation on death. It is good to think on it many times before, that one may succeed in it at the last.
MAXIME CCXXX. To open ones Eyes when it is time. All who see, have not their Eyes open; nor do all that look see. To reflect too late, is not a remedy, but a vexation. Some begin to see when there is no more to be seen. They have undone their houses, and squandered away their for∣tunes, before they made any thing of themselves. It's hard to give understan∣ding to him that has no mind to have it; and harder still to give the will to him that has no understanding. They who are about them, play with them, as with blind men, and they are a diversion for all the company. And seeing they are deaf to hear, they never open their Eyes to see. Nevertheless there are some who foment that insensibility, because their well-being consists in procuring others to be nothing. Unhappy the Horse, whose Master has no Eyes! He will hardly ever be fat.
MAXIME CCXXXI. Never to shew things before they be finished. All beginnings are defective, and the imagination is always prejudiced. The remembring to have seen a thing imper∣fect, takes from one the liberty of think∣ing it pretty when it is finished. To have a full view at once of a great object, is a hindrance to judge of every part of it; but it is also a pleasure that fills the whole imagination. A thing is nothing, till it be all: and when a thing begins to be, it is farther from being any thing. To see the most exquisite Dishes drest, provokes more disgust than Appetite. Let every skilfull Master then, have a care not to let his works be seen in embrio. Let him learn of Nature not to expose them, till they be in a condition of appearing. MAXIME CCXXXII. To understand the Commerce of life a little. All must not be Theory, let there be some Practice also. The wisest are easily deceived. For though they understand the extraordinary, yet they are ignorant
of the ordinary way of living; which is the most necessary. The contemplation of high things, suffers them not to think of those which are common: and seeing they are ignorant of what they ought first to know, that's to say, of what eve∣ry one doth, they are lookt upon with wonder, or esteemed ignorant by the vul∣gar, who consider onely the surface. Let a wise man then take care to know as much of the Commerce of life, as may serve to keep him from being the fop, or laughing stock of others. Let him be a man of management. For though that be not the highest point of life, it is ne∣vertheless the most usefull. What is knowledge good for, if it be not put into practice? To know how to live, is now a days the true knowledge. MAXIME CCXXXIII. To find out the palate of others. Else you'll displease, instead of plea∣sing. Some for want of understanding the tempers of people, vex when they thought to oblige. There are actions that are flattery for some, and an offence for others: and many times that which was believed to be a good Office, hath
proved a disservice. It hath sometimes cost more to doe a displeasure, than to doe a pleasure. How can we please other men, if we know not their humour? Hence it is that some have censured, think∣ing they praised: a punishment which they well deserved. Others think to di∣vert by their Eloquence, and cloy the mindby their babling. MAXIME CCXXXIV. Never to engage ones Reputation without good assurances of the honour and inte∣grity of others. To follow the way of silence, is the way to profit: but to lose, facility will doe the work. As to the concerns of Honour, it is good always to make one in company: so that ones own Reputa∣tion be obliged to take care of the Repu∣tation of another. One must never be surety: but if that sometimes happen, let it be done so discreetly, that Prudence may yield to Circumspection. Let the risque be common, and the Cause reci∣procal, to the end that he who is the Accomplice, may not set up for an Evi∣dence.
MAXIME CCXXXV. To know how to ask. There is nothing easier for some, nor more difficult for others. Some there are, who cannot refuse, and by conse∣quent there's no need of a hook to draw from them what one would have. There are others again, whose first word is al∣ways no: with those there is need of cunning. But of whomsoever we have any thing to ask, we ought to nick our time; as, for instance, at the conclusion of a good Meal, or of some other re∣freshment, that hath put them in a good humour: in case the Prudence of him that is addressed to, prevent not the Artifice of him who desires. Days of rejoycing are the days of favour, because the joy within spreads it self abroad. We are not to present our selves, when we see another denied, seeing then the fear of saying no, is surmounted. When there is melancholly within doors, nothing is to be done. To oblige before hand, is a bill of Exchange, when the Correspon∣dent is a civil man.
MAXIME CCXXXVI. To make that a favour, which would have been afterwards but a reward. That's the art of greatest Politicians. Favours, which go before Merits, are the touch-stone of Gentlemen. An antici∣pated favour hath two perfections: one is, the promptitude, which obliges the receiver to greater gratitude: and the other, because the same gift, which co∣ming later would be a debt, by anticipa∣tion is a pure favour. A cunning way of transforming obligations, since he, who would have deserved to be rewar∣ded, is obliged to a thankfull acknow∣ledgment. I speak of men of honour. For, as to others, it would rather be a curb than a spur, to give them an honou∣rary before hand. MAXIME CCXXXVII. Never to be privy to the secrets of Supe∣riours. You may think to share in the Plums, but it is onely in the Stones. To have been confidents, hath been the undoing
of many. It is with confidents, as with the crust of bread, that is used instead of a spoon, which runs the risque of being swallowed down with the broth. Confi∣dence is not the favour, but the impost of the Prince. Many break their Look∣ing-glass, because it shews them their ug∣liness. A Prince cannot abide to see the man, who may have seen him: and the witness of an ill act, is always ill lookt upon. One ought never to be too much obliged to any body, and far less to great men. Services rendred, stand better with them than favours received. But above all things, the confidences of Friend∣ship are dangerous. He that hath entru∣sted his secret to another, hath made him∣self his slave: and in Sovereigns, it is a violence that cannot last long. For they are impatient to redeem their lost liberty: and for succeeding in that, they'll overturn every thing, nay, and reason it self. It's a Maxime for secrets, Neither to hear them, nor tell them. MAXIME CCXXXVIII. To know the piece that we want. Several men would be great, if they wanted not a somewhat, without which
they never attain to the height of per∣fection. It's to be observed in some, that they might be worth much, if they would supply a little defect. To some, seriousness is wanting, for fault of which great qualities have no lustre in them. To others, sweetness of carriage: a defect, which those that frequent their company, soon discover, and especially in dignified persons. In some more briskness is desi∣red; and in others more reservedness. It were easie to supply all these defects, if one minded them. For reflexion may turn Custome into a second Nature. MAXIME CCXXXIX. Not to be too-quaint. It's better to be reserved. To know more than is needfull, is to blunt the edge of wit, seeing subtilties, commonly, are easily crackt. Truth well authorized is surer. It is good to have understan∣ding, but not a flux at the mouth. Too much reasoning looks like jangling. A solid judgment that reasons no more than what is fit, is much better.
MAXIME CCXL. To know how to play the Ignorant. The ablest man sometimes acts this part: and there are occasions, when the best knowledge is to pretend not to know. One must not be ignorant, but onely pretend to be so. It sig∣nifies little to be knowing with Fops, and Prudent with Fools. We are to speak to every man according to his Character. He is not the ignorant who pretends to be such, but he that is catch'd by such. Not he that counterfeits, but he that really is so. The onely way to be beloved, is to put on the skin of the silliest of Animals. MAXIME CCXLI. To suffer raissery, but not to use it. The one is a kind of Gallantry; the other a sort of Engagement. He that is off of the hinges when people are re∣joycing, has much, and shews still more of the nature of a Beast. Jocoseness is di∣verting. He that can suffer it, passes for a man of great stock: whereas he that is netled at it, provokes others to nettle
him the more. The best way is to let it pass without making too much on't. The greatest truths have always come from raillery. There is nothing that demands more circumspection nor skill. Before one begin, he ought to know the reach of him, with whom he intends to make himself merry. MAXIME CCXLII. To pursue ones point. There are some onely good for begin∣ning, who never bring any thing to an end. They invent, but they prosecute not, so inconstant is their mind. They never acquire Reputation, because they never proceed to a period. These always end by stopping short. In others, that comes from impatience, and it is the fault of the Spaniards, as patience is the vertue of the Flemings. These see the end of affairs, and affairs see the end of those. They sweat till they have overcome the difficulty, and then rest content that they have weathered it. They know not how to make the best of their victory. They shew that they can, but that they will not. But after all, it is still a fault either of inability, or levity. If the design be good,
why should it not be accomplished? if it be bad, why begun? let a man of parts then, kill his game, and let him not stop at starting of it. MAXIME CCXLIII. Not to be a Dove in all things. Let the cunning of the Serpent go in course with the simplicity of the Dove. There is nothing easier than to deceive a good man. He that neverlies, easily be∣lieves; and he that never deceives, confides much. To be deceived is not always a sign of brutishness: For goodness is some∣times the cause of it. There are two sorts of people that well knew how to prevent a mischief, the one, because they have learnt what it is at their own cost; and the others, because they have learnt it at the expence of others. Prudence ought then to be as carefull to caution it self, as cunning is to cheat. Have a care not to be so good a man, that others may take occasion from it of being bad. Be a composition of the Dove and Serpent; not a Monster, but a Prodigy.
MAXIME CCXLIV. To know how to oblige. Some so well metamorphose favours, that it seems they doe them, even when they receive them. There are men of such parts, that they oblige by asking, because they transform their own interest into anothers honour.) They so adjust matters, that one would say, others dis∣charged their duty, when they grant them what they ask, so dextrous they are in inverting the order of obligations by a singular knack of Policy. At least they make it doubtfull who it is that obliges. They buy the best thing with praises: and when they insinuate a desire to have it, it is thought an honour to bestow it. For they ingage Civility by making that a debt, which ought to be the cause of their thankfulness. Thus they change the obligation from passive to active, be∣ing better Politicians than Grammarians. That, in reality, is a great dexterity: but it would be a greater still to see into it, and to baulk such a foolish bargain, by giving them back their Civilities, and every one re-taking his own.
MAXIME CCXLV. To reason sometimes quite contrary to the mobile. That shews a high mind. A great Genius ought not to esteem those who never contradict him. For that's no mark of their affection to him, but of their love to themselves. Let him have a care of being the fop to flattery by an∣swering it any otherwise, than with the contempt which it deserves. Let him even take it for an honour to be censu∣red by some people, and particularly by those, who speak ill of all good men. Let it vex him, if his actions please all sorts of men, seeing that's a sign that they are not such as they ought to be: what is perfect being observed but of a very few. MAXIME CCXLVI. Never to give satisfaction to those who demand none. To give even too much to those who demand it, is a blameable action. To make an excuse before it be time, is to
accuse ones self. To be let bloud, when one is in health, is a signal for a sickness to come. An anticipated excuse awakens a discontent that slept. A Prudent Man ought not to seem sensible of another's suspicion, because that is to court his re∣sentment. He ought onely endeavour to cure that suspicion by a sincere and civil deportment. MAXIME CCXLVII. To know a little more, and to live a little less. Others on the contrary say, that ho∣nest leisure is better than much business. Nothing is ours, but time, which even they, who have no fixt habitation enjoy. It is an equal misfortune to employ the pretious time of life in mechanical exer∣cises, or in the hurry of great affairs. One is not to load himself neither with business, nor envy. That's to live, and yet be choak't in a Croud. Some extend this precept even to Sciences. But not to know, is not to live. See Maxime 4.
MAXIME CCXLVIII. Not to put off to the last. There are men of a last impression, (for impertinence runs always upon ex∣tremes.) They have a mind and a will of wax. The last applies the Seal, and effaces all the others. These men are ne∣ver gained, because with the same facility they are lost. Every body gives them a tincture. They are the worst confidents in the world. They are Children as long as they live: and as such, they onely flote in the ebb and flood of their opini∣ons and passions, always lame both in will and judgment, because they toss themselves now to one side, and by and by again to the other. MAXIME CCXLIX. Not to begin to live, where we should leave off. Some take their ease in the beginning, and leave the pains to the latter end. What is substantial ought to go first, and the accessory after, if there be place for that. Others would triumph, before
they fight. Some again begin their know∣ledge by what least concerns them, de∣laying the study of things that might prove usefull and honourable unto them, till life is like to fail. Hardly hath such a man begun to make his fortune, but he is gone, or going. The method is equally necessary both for knowing and living. MAXIME CCL. When must one reason the contrary way. When men speak to us with a design to surprize us. With some people every thing ought to be taken in a contrary sense. The yea is the no, and the no the yea. To undervalue a thing is a sign one esteems it: seeing he that would have it for himself, depretiates it to others. To praise is not always to speak good: for some, that they may not praise the good, affect to commend the bad. He that thinks no body bad, will think no man good.
MAXIME CCLI. We are to use Humane means, as if there were none Divine; and Divine means, as if there were none Humane. It is the precept of a great Master, and needs no Commentary. MAXIME CCLII. Not altogether for thy self, nor altogether for others neither. Both the one and the other is an insup∣portable Tyranny. To be altogether for ones self, infers necessarily, that one would have all to himself. These men cannot part with an ace of any thing that's con∣venient for them. They oblige little, they trust to their Fortune, but com∣monly that support fails them. It is good sometimes to forsake our selves for the sake of others, to the end others may doe so for us. Whoever is in publick place, is by duty a publick Servant. Otherwise it will be said to him, what the old Wo∣man said once to Adrian the Emperour: Renounce then thy place, as thou dost thy duty. On the contrary, others are al∣together
for others. For folly runs always to excess, and is very unlucky in that par∣ticular. They have not a day, nor so much as an hour for themselves, and they are so little their own men, that there was one who was called Every bodies man. They are not themselves even in the un∣derstanding. For they know for all, and are ignorant for themselves. Let a man of sense consider, that it is not he who is courted, but an interest that is in him, or depends upon him. MAXIME CCLIII. Not to be too intelligible. Most part do not esteem what they conceive, but admire what they under∣stand not. Things must cost somewhat, that they may be valued. One will pass for an able man, when he is not under∣stood. He is to appear always more pru∣dent, and intelligent than is needfull, with him to whom he speaks; but with pro∣portion rather than excess. And though good sense be of great weight amongst knowing men, yet sublimity is necessary to please the most part. We must take from them the means of censuring, by busying their minds in conceiving. Ma∣ny
praise that which they can give no reason for, when it is asked them: be∣cause they reverence as a mystery all that is hard to be comprehended, and extoll it, by reason they hear it extolled. MAXIME CCLIV. Not to slight the evil, because it is little. For an evil never comes all alone. Evils, as well as blessings hang together as by links. Happiness and misery attend those commonly who have most of either: and thence it is, that all avoid the unhappy, and court the fortunate. Doves them∣selves, for all their simplicity, rest on the fairest Pidgeon House. Every thing goes wrong with the unfortunate man, he is wanting to himself, in losing the favoura∣ble gale. Misfortune, when asleep, is not to be awakened. A slippery step is no great matter, and yet it hath occasioned a fatal fall, from which one could not tell how to recover. For as no good is per∣fect, so is there no evil neither at its high∣est pitch. That which proceeds from Heaven above, requires patience; and that which arises from the world below, Prudence.
MAXIME CCLV. To doe small kindnesses at a time, but often. Engagement should never exceed Abili∣ty. Whoever gives much, does not give but sell. Gratitude is not to be overloa∣ded▪ For he that finds himself in an im∣possibility to make satisfaction, will break off the Correspondence. The way to lose many Friends, is excessively to oblige them. Being unable to re-pay, they with∣draw, and from being obliged, turn Enemies. A statue would be willing never to see its maker, nor the obliged his benefactour. The best method in giving, is to order things so, that it cost but little, and that that little be earnestly desired, to the end it may be the more esteemed. MAXIME CCLVI. To be always in a readiness to ward the blows of Clowns, Opiniatours, proud Per∣sons, and of all other Impertinents. There are a great many such to be met with, and it is Prudence never to come to a brush with them: Let a wise man dayly look in the glass of reflexion, that
he may see the need he hath of arming himself with resolution, and by that means he will disappoint all the jirks of folly. If he think seriously on that, he'll never expose himself to the ordinary risques that men run into, by engaging with Fools. A man armed with Pru∣dence, will never be baffled by imperti∣nence. The Navigation of civil life is dangerous, because it is full of Rocks, on which Reputation splits. The surest way is to turn aside, taking lessons of cunning from Ʋlysses. Here an artificious defeat does great service. But above all, save thy self by thy wit. For that's the shor∣test way of making the best of a bad bar∣gain. MAXIME CCLVII. Never to come to a Rupture. For Reputation by so doing comes al∣ways off shattered. Any man is suffici∣ent to be an Enemy, but not a Friend. Few are in a condition of doing good, but all almost can doe mischief. The Eagle is not secure in the armes of Jupiter him∣self, if it offend the Beetle. Secret Ene∣mies that lie upon the watch, blow the fire, when they see the War declared.
Friends that quarrel, become the worst Enemies. They reckon their own choice amongst other mens faults. Spectatours of the rupture speak severally of it, as they think, and think what they desire. They condemn both parties either for want of foresight in the beginning, or of patience in the end, but always of Pru∣dence. If the rupture be inevitable, it ought at least to be excusable. An indiffe∣rence would doe better than a violent de∣claration. On this occasion, a handsome retreat is honourable. MAXIME CCLVIII. To look out for one that may help to carry the burthen of adversity. Be never alone, especially in dangers. Else thou wilt charge thy self with all the hatred. Some think to raise them∣selves by taking upon them the whole oversight of businesses, and they attract to themselves all the envy: whereas with a companion one secures himself against the evil, or at least bears but part of it. Neither fortune nor the whimsey of the people can play so easily upon two. The skilfull Physician, who hath not succeeded in the cure of his Patient, never fails to
take the assistence of another, who un∣der the name of consultation, helps him to bear up the Pall. Divide then the office and trouble of it: for it is intolera∣ble to suffer alone. MAXIME CCLIX. To prevent offences, and turn them into favours. There is more dexterity in shunning, than in revenging them. It is great address to make a confident of him, who might have been an Adversary; and to transform those into butteresses of Reputation, who threatned to ruine the same. It is of great use to know how to oblige. To prevent an injury by a favour, is to intercept its course: and it is great skill in living, to change that which was like to cause no∣thing but discontent into pleasure. Place then thy confidence in malevolence it self. MAXIME CCLX. Thou shalt never be wholly at the devotion of any one, nor any one at thine. Neither is bloud, friendship, nor the strictest obligation sufficient for that. For
it must be another-guess interest that can oblige one to abandon his heart and will. The greatest union admits of exception, and without prejudice too to the laws of most intimate Friendship. The Friend al∣ways reserves some secret, and the Son conceals somewhat even from the Father. Some things are made mysteries to some, and yet communicated to others; and contrariwise: so that a man resigns or re∣fuses himself wholly, according to the distinction he makes of those of his Cor∣respondence. MAXIME CCLXI. Not to continue a Foppery. Some make an engagement of their mistakes: when they have once be∣gun to fail, they think they are concer∣ned in honour to continue. Their heart accuses their fault, and their mouth defends it. Whence it happens, that if they have been taxed for inadvertency, when they began the foppery, they pass for fools, when they continue it. An im∣prudent proneness, and a rash resolution, impose no obligation. Thus, some con∣tinue their first foolery, and make their
silliness the more remarkable, by a vani∣ty in appearing constant impertinents. See the Maxime 214. MAXIME CCLXII. To know how to forget. That's a happiness rather than an art. Those things are best remembred which ought most to be forgotten. The memo∣ry hath not onely the incivility to fail one in time of need, but also the imper∣tinence, to be unseasonably officious. In all that's like to be troublesome, it is pro∣digal; and barren in every thing that might give pleasure. Sometimes the re∣medy of the evil consists in forgetting it, and we forget the remedy. Memory then must be accustomed to take another course, because it is it that can give us ei∣ther a Paradise or a Hell. I except those who live contentedly. For in their state of Innocence they enjoy the felicity of Idiots.
MAXIME CCLXIII. Many things that serve for pleasure, ought not to be peculiar. One enjoys more of what is another's, than of what belongs to himself. The first day is for the Master, and all the rest for Strangers. One doubly enjoys what belongs to others, that's to say, not onely without fear of loss, but also with the pleasure of Novelty. Privation makes every thing better. The water of another man's Well is as delicious as Nectar. Besides that possession lessens the pleasure of enjoyment, it augments the trouble, whether in lending, or in not lending. It serves onely to preserve things for another: and over and above, the number of the discontented is always greater, than of the thankfull. MAXIME CCLXIV. To be at no time careless. Lot takes pleasure in surprize. It will let slip a thousand occasions to take its men one day napping. Wit, Prudence and Courage ought to be upon the guard,
and in like manner beauty, inasmuch as the day of its confidence, will be that of the loss of its credit. The Who thought on't is the trip that turns up the heels. Besides, it is an ordinary trick of others malice to lay a snare for good qualities, that they may be more rigorously sifted. The days of ostentation are well known, and cunning pretends not to mind it: but it chuses the day when one least expects, to make a tryal of what one is able to doe. MAXIME CCLXV. To know how to engage ones Dependents. A pat engagement hath put a great ma∣ny men in credit, just as a ship wreck makes good swimmers. By that, many have displayed their industry and abili∣ty, which would have lain buried in their retirement, if occasion had not presen∣ted. Difficulties and dangers are the causes and spurs of Reputation. A great courage, in the occasions of honour, does as much service as a thousand others. Queen Isabelle of Castile, knew eminent∣ly that lesson of engaging, as well as all others: and the great Captain Gonsalvo owed all his Reputation to that politick
Address, which was the cause also, that many others became great men. MAXIME CCLXVI. To be too good, is to be naught. He is so, who is never angry. Insen∣sible men are scarcely men. That quali∣ty proceeds not always from indolency, but often from incapacity. To resent when it is proper, is the action of a com∣plete man. Birds at first sight scorn your carved figures. To mingle the sharp with the sweet, is the sign of a good relish. Sweetness alone is onely for Chil∣dren and Idiots. It's a great misfortune to fall into that insensibility, by being too good natured. That man, says he, in the seventh Cri∣tick of the third part of his Criticon, is one of those who are called insensible; of those people, whom nothing can alter, and who are not concerned at any thing; not so much as at the greatest reverse of fortune, nor the imperfection of their own nature, nor yet the home-thrusts of malice. The whole world may conspire against them, it's all one to them; it will nei∣ther spoil their Appetite, nor break their sleep. And that they call indolence, nay, great courage too.
MAXIME CCLXVII. Silken words. Arrows pierce the body, and bad words the soul. A good humour makes a good tongue. It's a great art in life to know how to sell air. Words answer almost every thing, and nothing is impossible for them. Men negotiate in the air, and with the air: and a strong breath lasts long. The mouth must always be full of sugar to sweeten the words. For Enemies themselves can then relish them. The onely way to be amiable is to be affable. See the end of the Commentary of the Maxime 14. MAXIME CCLXVIII. The Wise Man ought to doe in the begin∣ning, what the Fool does in the end. Both doe the same thing: the diffe∣rence is that the one does it in season, and the other out of season. He, who in the beginning has his mind wrong set, continues to be so in all the rest. He draws with his foot what he should carry on his head; he makes his right hand his left: so that he is left-handed in all his Conduct. After all, it always happens, that they doe by force what they might
have done of their own accord: whereas the wise man sees what is to be done time∣ly and at leisure, and puts it in execution with pleasure and Reputation. MAXIME CCLXIX. To make the best of ones being new. So long as it lasts, one will be estee∣med. It generally takes because of va∣riety, which pleases the palate. An or∣dinary thing, but spick and span new, is more valued, than a rarity that is seen of∣ten. Excellences wear out and soon grow old. That glory of Novelty will not last long, it's but a nine days wonder. Make use then of the first fruits of E∣steem, by gaining speedily all that thou can'st pretend to from a transi∣ent complaisance. For if once the fresh gloss be gone, the passion will cool, and that which pleased as being new, will cloy as being common. Every thing hath had its time, and then been slighted. MAXIME CCLXX. Not to condemn singly what pleaseth many. For there must be some good in it, when
so many are content with it: and though it be not told what it is, yet it is known and enjoyed. Singularity is always odi∣ous, and when ill grounded, ridiculous. It disgraces rather the person than the ob∣ject. So that one will be left alone with his whimsical palate. Let him that is not able to discern the good conceal the weak∣ness of his judgment, and not meddle in condemning at random. For a bad dis∣cerning springs from ignorance. What all men say, is, or would be so. MAXIME CCLXXI. Let him that knows but little in his pro∣fession, stick to what he knows best. For if he be not reckoned quaint, at least he'll be reckoned solid. He that knows, may engage, and doe at his plea∣sure: but to know little, and to run a risque, is a voluntary precipice. Hold always to the surer side. What is au∣thorized cannot fail. For a weak know∣ledge a beaten path: and besides, securi∣ty is better than singularity, not onely for the knowing, but also for the igno∣rant.
MAXIME CCLXXII. To sell things as Courtesie thinks fit to va∣lue them. That's the way to oblige the more. The selfish demand of the interested man will never equal the good grace of a ge∣nerous obliged heart in giving. Courte∣sie does not give, but engage; and the gallant way of it renders the obligation the greater. Nothing costs an honest man dearer, than what is frankly given him. It is to sell it to him twice, and at two different rates, the one at the worth of the thing, and the other at the value of the Generosity. It's true, however, that Gallantry is not a Commodity for the use of sneaking beggarly fellows, be∣cause they know not what it is to live like men. MAXIME CCLXXIII. Thoroughly to know the temper of those with whom we have to doe. The effect is soon known, when once the cause is known. It is known first in it self, and then its motive. The melan∣choly
person always, presages misfor∣tunes, and the back-biter faults. The worst runs always in their heads; and as they see not the present good, so they denounce future evils that may or may not happen. A man prepossessed with passion, speaks always in a style different to what things are. Passion and not rea∣son speaks in him; every one judges ac∣cording to his caprice or humour, and no body according to truth. Learn then to unmask a counterfeit shew, and to spell out the characters of the heart. Study with thy self to know him that always laughs without reason; and him that ne∣ver laughs but when he should. Distrust an asker of many questions as an imperti∣nent, or a spy. Seldom expect good from those who have any natural defor∣mity in body. For it is usual with them to be revenged of Nature in doing her as little honour as she hath done to them. Commonly silliness bears proportion to beauty. MAXIME CCLXXIV. To have the gift of pleasing. Civility is a strong political magick. It is a gentile hook, to be used rather for at∣tracting
hearts, than drawing in of pro∣fit; or rather, indeed, for all things. Merit will not doe the work, if it be not seconded by agreeableness, on which de∣pends all the plausibility of actions. This agreeableness is the most efficacious in∣strument of Sovereignty. There is a luck in't to put others into appetite: yet Artifice contributes to that also. In all things where there is much of Nature, Art always succeeds best. From thence springs that unaccountable somewhat, which gains universal favour. MAXIME CCLXXV. To conform to common Custome, but not to common Folly. Be not always starched in thy gravity, it's part of Gallantry to dispence with a little decorum for gaining the common good will. Sometimes we may doe as others have done, and still without in∣decency. He that is taken for a fool in publick, will never be reckoned a Wise Man in private. There is more lost in one day of liberty, than gained by a long course of seriousness. But one must not always be for exception neither. To be singular is to condemn others. And it's
worse still to affect sanctified looks. That's to be left to the Women. Nay, some∣times your Godly render themselves ridi∣culous. It is the best of a man to appear like a man. A Woman may with grace∣fullness affect a manly air, but a Man cannot without disparagement take upon him that of a Woman. MAXIME CCLXXVI. To be able to retrieve ones Genius by Na∣ture and by Art. Man, they say, changes his temper once in seven years. In a good time, if it be for the better. In the first seven years reason comes to him. Let him so order things, that at every change he may acquire some new perfection. He ought to observe that natural revolution, that he may second it, and advance still farther and farther in the sequel. Thus many have changed their Conduct, as well in their condition, as employment. And sometimes it is not perceived, till the greatness of the alteration be observed. At twenty years of age a Peacock; at thirty a Lion; at fourty a Camel; at fifty a Serpent; at sixty a Dog; at seventy an Ape; at fourscore nothing at all.
This Allegory is explained in the dis∣course 56 of the Authour's Agudeza, in these terms. Man, because of the dignity of his Nature, thinking that he ought to be im∣mortal, ask't Jupiter, how long he was to live, Jupiter made answer, That when he resolved to create all Animals, and then man, he had proposed to allow eve∣ry one of them thirty years of life. Man was surprized to hear that so wonderfull a piece of Workmanship, as he was, had been made to last so short a time, and that his life must pass like a slower. He thought it strange, that being scarcely come out of his Mother's Womb, he was to enter into that of the Earth, without enjoying the pleasant state, wherein he was created. I beseech thee then, said he, O Jupiter, (if it be so that my desire be not contrary to thy Decrees) that since all the Animals unworthy of thy favours, have refused twenty years of the term of life, which thou hast given them, being ignorant of the good thou didst them, as being destitute of reason: it would please thee to grant them to me, that I may live them in their stead, and that thou mayst be better served by me. Jupiter finding the desire reasonable, allowed it: so that ha∣ving lived his own thirty years, he should
begin to live, first, the twenty years, that the Ass yielded, on condition that he should perform all its duties, in labou∣ring, carting, drawing, and carrying to the House all that was necessary for Hus∣bandry. That from fifty to seventy years of age he should live the twenty years of the Dog, barking, and growling, as ha∣ving many troubles, and no pleasure in any thing. And that at length from se∣venty to ninety he should accomplish the years of the Ape, in imitating the defects of Nature. So we see that they who come to that age, are accustomed, as old as they are, to affect to seem young, to dress and spruce up themselves, and to use the exercises of Youth, that they may seem to be what they are not; as also to play with Children, as Apes doe. He says the very same thing almost in the last Chapter of his Discreet. Thirty years, says he, were given to man for enjoyment and rejoycing; twenty were lent him upon his word, for labouring; twenty more of the Dog for barking; and the last twenty to play and fool with little Children, like Apes.
MAXIME CCLXXVII. The man of true Ostentation. That Talent gives luster to all others, every thing hath its time, and that time is to be watched. For every day is not a day of triumph. There are some men of a particular Character, in whom little appears to be much, and the much makes them admired. When excellence concurs with stallage, it passes for a Prodigy. There are ostentative Nations, and the Spanish with the first. The shew stands in stead of much, and particularly, if reality vouch for it. Heaven, which gives perfection, bespeaks ostentation; for without it all perfection would be un∣der constraint. Art must goe along with Ostentation. The excellentest things depend on circumstances, and by conse∣quent are not always in season. When∣ever Ostentation comes unseasonably, it succeeds ill. Nothing admits less of af∣fectation, and that's the rock that Osten∣tation always splits upon, because it bor∣ders near upon vanity, and vanity is very subject to contempt. It hath need of great moderation, that it may not be offensive. For the too much of it hath
already discredited it amongst men of parts. Sometimes it consists in a dumb Elo∣quence, and in shewing perfection with∣out design. For a wise dissimulation makes a plausible Parade; the same pri∣vation exciting curiosity the more. Its greatest art is, not to shew all its perfecti∣on at once, but by degrees, and as if one were a-painting of it, to discover it the more. A lovely pattern ought to oblige men to shew somewhat still more lovely, and the applause given to the first piece, makes the Spectatours impatient to see the rest. This Maxime is taken from the Au∣thour's Apologue, entituled, Hombre de Ostentation, the Abstract whereof shall serve for a Commentary. What is not seen, saith he, is as if it were not in being. All knowledge is no∣thing, if others are ignorant of that thou knowest, said a great Satyrist. Scire tuum nihil est, nisi te scire hoc sciat alter. Pers. Things go not for what they are, but for what they appear to be. There are many more fops than men of wit. Those are satisfied with appearance; and though these stick to the substance, yet deceit
prevails, and makes all things to be va∣lued according to the outside. And a page after. Know, said the Ambassadours of the other Birds, to the Peacock, that all our Re-publick is offended at thy in∣supportable Pride. For it is an odious piece of singularity in thee, that thou alone must spread thy vain tail before the Sun, which no other Bird dares to doe, though there be many that have better right to doe it than thou hast. And there∣fore thou art commanded by an irrevo∣cable sentence, to abstain for the future from signalizing thy self, &c. To which the Peacock made answer: Why do you condemn in me the Ostentation, and not the Beauty? Heaven that hath bestowed this upon me, hath in like manner com∣plemented me with the other. What would reality signifie to me without shew? Politicians now a-days moot nothing else, but that the greatest Wisedom consists in making it appear. To know, and to know how to set it off, is doubly to know. For my own part, I would say of Ostentation, what others say of good fortune, that an ounce of Ostentation is better than pounds of capacity without it. What signifies it, though a thing be excellent, if it appear not? And two pages after. It is a politick Probleme,
whether or not reality be better than ap∣pearance. There are things great in themselves, which appear not, and others that are inconsiderable, which appear much. So great effect produces the ha∣ving or wanting Ostentation. There are men in whom the little makes a great shew, and whose much is a subject of ad∣miration. These are men of Parade; for when excellence and appearance con∣cur, they form a Prodigy. On the con∣trary, we have seen eminent persons, who have not appeared to be one half of what they were, for want of the dexte∣rity of Ostentation. It is not long since, that a great Man, who in the field drove all before him, being called to a Council of War, was afraid of every body. He, that was so proper for action, was not at all for speaking. Ostentation gives a true lustre to Heroick Qualities, and, as it were, a second being to all things: that's to say, if reality vouch for it. For without merit, it is but a vulgar cheat: it serves onely to manifest defects, and by consequent to beget contempt instead of applause. Some make a great bustle to get out and appear upon the Theatre of the World, and all they doe is to publish the ignorance, which retirement civily concealed. But that is not to make Osten∣tation
of Talents, but foppishly to de∣clare ones faults. MAXIME CCLXXVIII. In all things to avoid being remarkable. By being so too much, perfections themselves will be defects. This comes of singularity, and singularity hath al∣ways been censured,. Whoever affects to be singular, must live by himself. Po∣liteness it self is ridiculous, if it be exces∣sive; it offends, when it glares too much to the Eye. Upon much stronger reason ought extravagant singularities to be nau∣seous. Nevertheless some would be known even by their vices to that de∣gree, that they seek out Novelty in wick∣edness, and glory in having so bad a Re∣putation. Nay, in the matter of ability it self, the too much degenerates into quack∣ing. MAXIME CCLXXIX. To suffer Contradiction without Gain-saying. It is to be distinguished when Contra∣diction proceeds from Cunning or Clow∣nishness. For it is not always an Opinio∣nativeness,
sometimes it is Artifice. Take heed then not to engage into the one, nor to stumble into the other. There is no pains better bestowed than in spying: nor no better counter-battery against those, who would pick the lock of the heart, than to put the key of reserve in the inside. See the Maxime 179. MAXIME CCLXXX. The man of good stuff. Honesty and integrity are gone: obli∣gations are forgotten. There are but few good Correspondences. The best service has the worst reward. This is the guise of the World now a days. There are whole Nations enclined to evil. Of the one, the treachery is always to be feared; of others the inconstancy; and of some the cheating. Make use then of the bad Correspondence of others, not as an exam∣ple to be imitated; but as a warning to be upon thy guard. Integrity runs a risque of being warped at the sight of a dishonest procedure; but a good man never forgets what he himself is, because of what others are.
MAXIME CCLXXXI. The approbation of knowing Men. An indifferent yea of a great man is more to be valued than the applause of a multi∣tude. When there is a bone in the wind-pipe, to snuffle is not to breath. The wise speak with judgment, and by consequent, their approbation gives complete satisfac∣tion. Prudent Antigonus placed his whole Renown in the single testimony of Zeno. And Plato called Aristotle his whole School. Some mind onely the filling of their Bellies, without minding that the Commons are but ordinary. Sovereigns themselves stand in need of good Writers, whose Pens are more to be feared by them, than a Picture to the life, by the ugly. MAXIME CCLXXXII. To make absence an expedient, for being respected, or esteemed. If presence lessen Reputation, absence encreases it. He who being absent is ta∣ken for a Lion, appears but a Mouse, when present. Perfections lose their lustre, if they be lookt upon at too near
distance: because men look more upon the back of the outside, than the substance and inside of the mind. Imagination goes much farther than the sight: and the mistake that commonly enters by the Ears, goes out by the Eyes. He that rests in the centre of the good Opinion, that People have of him, preserves his Re∣putation. The Phoenix it self makes use of retirement and desire, to make it self to be the more esteemed and regrated. MAXIME CCLXXXIII. The Man of good invention. Invention marks a fruitfulness of wit. But where is it to be found without a grain of folly? Invention is the share of quick wits, and the good choice that of so∣lid judgments. The former is rarer, and more esteemed, inasmuch as many have succeeded in chusing well, and very few in inventing well, and in having the pre∣cedency of excellence, as well as that of time. Novelty is insinuant, and if it be happy, it sets a double value upon what is good. In matters that concern judg∣ment, it is dangerous, because it runs up∣on Paradoxes; in knacks of subtilty it is laudable: and if Novelty and invention
jump well together, they are plaufible. MAXIME CCLXXXIV. Meddle not in other mens business, and thine own will go well. Esteem thy self, if thou wouldst be esteemed. Be rather covetous than pro∣digal of thy self. Make thy self to be desired, and thou shalt be well received. Never come till thou be called, and never go till thou be sent. He that engages of his own head, incurs all the hatred, if he succeed not; and though he succeed, he is not liked the better for it. A man that is too intrigueing, is the But of contempt: and as he introduces himself without shame, he is repulsed with confusion. MAXIME CCLXXXV. Not to lose ones self with another. Know, that he who is in the mire, calls thee not, but to comfort himself at thy cost, when thou art bemired with him. The unfortunate look out for some body, to help them to bear their affliction. He who in prosperity turned his back, will in adversity stretch forth his hand. Con∣sider
well that thou mayst not be drow∣ned, by endeavouring to help those who are a-drowning. MAXIME CCLXXXVI. Suffer not thy self to be obliged, nor by all sorts of People. For that would be to become a com∣mon slave. Some are born to be more happy than others; the first for doing of good, and the others for receiving it. Li∣berty is more pretious than all gifts: and to receive, is to lose it. It is better to keep others in dependance, than to de∣pend upon one alone. The onely advan∣tage of Sovereignty is, that it can doe more good. Above all, have a care not to reckon any obligation as a favour. Be persuaded, that men most commonly seek to oblige, that they may engage. MAXIME CCLXXXVII. Never to act in passion. Otherwise, all will be spoil'd. Let him that is not himself, have a care not to doe any thing by himself. For passion always banishes reason. Let him then
substitute a prudent Mediatour, who will be so, if he be without passion. Standers∣by judge better than the Gamesters, be∣cause they fall not into passion. When one finds himself moved, retentiveness should beat the retreat, lest the choler may be more heated. For then every thing would be done violently, and by some minutes of fury, one would prepare to himself a subject of long repentance, and great repining. MAXIME CCLXXXVIII. To live according to occasion. Whether it be action, or discourse, all ought to be squared according to the time. We must resolve; when we can, for Time and Tide stays for no man. Re∣gulate not thy life by general Maximes, unless it be in favour of Vertue. Pre∣scribe no positive laws to thy will: for thou wilt be forced next day to drink of the same water which thou despisest to day. Some mens impertinence is so whimsical, that they would have all the circumstances of a project quadrate to their madness, instead of accommodating themselves to circumstances. But a Wise Man knoweth that to conform to the
times, is the North Star of Prudence. MAXIME CCLXXXIX. What most discredits a Man, is to shew that he is man. He is no longer reckoned Divine, so soon as he is known to have much in him of man. Levity is the greatest counter∣poise of Reputation. As a grave man passes for more than man, so a light shit∣tlecock is hardly reckoned a man. No vice discredits so much as levity, inasmuch as it is diametrically opposed to gravity. A light man cannot be substantial, and especially if he be old, seeing his age re∣quires more Prudence. And though this fault be very common, yet it is strangely derived in every particular person that has it. MAXIME CCXC. It's a happiness to join esteem with affection. To be respected, there is no need to be too much beloved. Love is bolder than hatred. (Affection and veneration sel∣dom agree together. And though it is not fit to be too much feared, yet neither
is it good to be too much beloved. Love begets familiarity, and as fast as this comes in, esteem goes out. It is better to be loved with respect, than with tender∣ness. That is the love which great men require. MAXIME CCXCI. To know how to make an essay. Let the address of a Judicious man coun∣terbalance the reservedness of a cunning man. A great judgment is required to measure the capacity of another. It's far better to know the character of minds, than the virtue of herbs and stones. That is one of the greatest secrets of life. Metals are known by their sound, and Men by their talk. Integrity is known by words, but much more y deeds. In this, much penetration, circumspection and caution is required. MAXIME CCXCII. To be above, and not below ones Employ∣ment. How great soever the station be, he who holds it, should shew himself still to
be greater. A man that hath wherewith, is still growing, and signalizes himself more and more in his employments: whereas he that hath a narrow heart, is soon at a stand, and is at length reduced to an inability of performing his obliga∣tions, and maintaining his Reputation. Augustus made it his honour to be a grea∣ter Man than Prince. A great heart, and a reasonable confidence in ones self are of great use here. MAXIME CCXCIII. Of Maturity. It's conspicuous in the garb, but much more in the manners. Material gravity makes Gold pretious, and Moral the Man. That gravity is the ornament of Quali∣ties, through the veneration that it attracts to them. The outside of Man is the fron∣tispiece of the Soul. Maturity is not a dull look, nor an affectation of demure gestures, as Dunces say; but a well weighed Authority. It speaks by senten∣ces, and acts always to the purpose. It supposes a complete man, that's to say, who is as much a great person, as a ma∣ture man. So soon as a man ceases to be a Child, he begins to be grave, and to shew his value.
MAXIME CCXCIV. To be moderate in ones Opinions. All judge according to their interests, and abound in their own sense. Most men make reason give way to passion. Let two be of a contradictory Opinion, yet each presumes to have reason on his side. But reason that hath always been faithfull, hath never had two faces. A Wise Man is to reflect upon so nice a point: and thereby, his doubting will correct the head-strongness of others. Let him sometimes go to his adversaries side, that he may examine what he grounds upon, and that will hinder him from con∣demning him, and so easily arrogating to himself the victory. MAXIME CCXCV. To be, and not seem to be a man of business. Those who have least to doe, would ap∣pear to be loaded with affairs. They make a mystery of every thing, and that with the greatest silliness imaginable. These are Cameleons of applause, but are heartily laughed at by every body.
Vanity is insupportable every where, but here it is flouted at. These little Pismires of honour go a-begging the glory of great exploits. Shew as little as thou canst thy most eminent qualities. Rest satis∣fied to doe, and leave it to others to talk of it. Give thy good actions, but sell them not. Golden Pens must never be hired to write upon dirt; which is an Eye-sore to all men of sense. Strive ra∣ther to be a Heroe, than to shew it. Those, (says he in the Chapter of his Discreet, entituled Hazasleria) pretend to most business, who have least, because they go a-hunting after occasions, and magnifie them. They set a great value upon things that are worth less than no∣thing. They make a mystery of every thing, and the smallest matter is to them a Prodigy. All their affairs are the prime transactions of the world, and all their actions exploits. Their whole life is a train of Miracles, to be published by the Trumpet of Fame. They have nothing that's common, every thing is singular in them, whether it be Valour, Knowledge, or Fortune. All vanity is justly recko∣ned foppish, but bragging is intolerable. Wise Men make it more their honour to be great, than to appear so. But these men rest satisfied with the bare appea∣rance.
To love to appear is so far from being a mark of sublimity in them, that on the contrary it is a demonstration of a low mind, since the least thing appears as much to them as the greatest. Pride is offensive every where, but chiefly here. They meet with contempt where they look for esteem. When they fansie to themselves that they will be admired, they find themselves exposed to the de∣rision of all men. Their vanity proceeds not at all from the greatness of Soul, but from the lowness of Heart, seeing they aspire not to true honour, but onely to shews; not to real exploits, but to brag of them, without doing them. There are others, who would seem to be migh∣ty Ministers, great men for magnifying objects, there is no business small as to them, of Atomes they make a great dust, and of a little a great noise. They give themselves out for men overwhelmed in business, and by consequent, desirous of repose and leisure. They speak onely by mystery, their least gesture is a subject of Divination. They make great excla∣mations, and then, that they may the more surprize, stop short, like to the Ma∣chines of Gianello della Torre, of as great noise, and as little profit. There is a great deal of difference, nay, and con∣trariety
betwixt great Doers, and great Talkers. For the more brave actions the former doe, the less they affect to speak of them. They are satisfied to doe, and leave it to others to tell what they have done; and though others should be silent, yet the things themselves would sufficient∣ly speak. The second sell at a dear rate, what others give gratis. They publish it with sound of Trumpet: and for want of Pens enough amongst those of Fame, they hire golden Pens, (that's to say mer∣cenary Pens) to make them write dirty Characters. And then he concludes in these terms. The Pens of Fame are not of Gold, because they are neither to be sold nor hired: but they have a better sound than the finest Silver; they are of no value; but they bestow it upon merit. To this may be added what Diogenes said one day to a young bragadocio, who alledged to him the multitude of his business: That it became him well to ape the Woman. MAXIME CCXCVI. The man of value, and majestick qualities. The great qualities make the great men. One of these alone is equivalent
to all the indifferent put together. Here∣tofore a man made it his honour to have nothing but what was great in his house, even to the most common utensils. By much stronger reason ought a great man to endeavour that all the qualities of his mind be great. As every thing is im∣mense and infinite in God, so ought all things to be great and majestick in a He∣roe. So that all his actions, nay, and all his words should be cloathed with a tran∣scendent majesty. MAXIME CCXCVII. To doe all things, as in the presence of wit∣nesses. That is a man worthy of considera∣tion, who considers that men behold him, or will behold him. He knows that the walls hear, and that wicked actions would rather burst than not get out. Even then when he is alone, he acts as if he were in the presence of all men, because he knows that all things will be known. He looks upon these as present witnesses, who by their discovery will be so afterwards. That man was not afraid that his Neigh∣bours should keep a Register of all he did in his house, who desired that all men might see it.
MAXIME CCXCVIII. The ready Wit, the profound Judgment, and the quaint Discerning. These three things make a Prodigy, and are the greatest gift of Divine boun∣ty. It is a great advantage to conceive well, a greater to reason well, and above all to have a good understanding. Wit ought not to be in the back-bone, which would render it more painfull than sharp. To think well is the fruit of being ratio∣nal. At twenty years of age the Will reigns; at thirty the Wit; at fourty, the Judgment. There are Wits, which, like the eyes of the Lynx, of themselves send forth light, and are most intelligent, when the obscurity is greatest. There are o∣thers, who are extemporary, and hit al∣ways upon that which is pattest to the purpose. They are always ready furni∣shed, and with what is good too. A most happy fecundity. But a discerning judg∣ment seasons the whole life.
MAXIME CCXCIX. To leave with an Appetite. Men are to be left with the Nectar up∣on their lips. Desire is the standard of esteem. Even in bodily thirst, it is a skil∣full management to provoke it, and not to satisfie it wholly. The good is doubly good, when there is but little of it. The abatement is great at the second bout. Too full an enjoyment is dangerous. For it causes the highest perfection to be de∣spised. The onely rule to please is to find an appetite left with a desire. If it be to be provoked, let it rather be by the im∣patience of longing, than the glut of en∣joyment. A felicity that costs pains, gives double contentment. MAXIME CCC. In a word, to be Holy. That is to say all at once. Vertue is the chain of all perfections, and the cen∣tre of all felicity. It renders a man pru∣dent, attentive, circumspect, wise, valiant, reserved, sincere, fortunate, plausible, true, and a Heroe in all things. Three things
make him happy, Health, Wisedom, and Holiness. Vertue is the Sun of the Mi∣crocosme, and a good Conscience is its Hemisphere. It is so lovely, that it gains the favour both of Heaven and Earth. Nothing but it is amiable, and nothing hatefull but Vice. Vertue is a thing in good earnest, every thing else is but mockery. Capacity and Grandure are to be measured by Vertue, and not by fortune. Vertue stands in need of nothing but it self. It renders man amiable in this life, and memorable af∣ter death. Principibus placuisse viris non ultima laus est. Non cuivis homini contingit adire Corin∣thum. Hor. Ep. 17. lib. 1. Epist. THE END.
