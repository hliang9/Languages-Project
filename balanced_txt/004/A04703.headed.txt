The vnite and Scisme of the olde Chirche. Blessed ar the atonmakers studyinge for peace / for thei ar the childern of God. Ma∣thew .v. M.D.XLIII. In Iune.
Of the vnite & Scisme of the olde Chirche. OWr Lorde / being the au∣tour of peace and vnite & not of stryfe & dissencion / anon from the begininge and from the fyrst calling of his people the Iewes / he most straightly bound them to gither reteyned into the felowship of one bodie bothe with lawes ecclesiastik and politike.Isa. lvij i. Cor. xiiij. For he com∣māded them to cleaue onely to the one god / him onely to call vpon / him onelye to loue & worship / yea and that with no nother rites nor by nonother wais then himself had pre∣scribed and taught them he prescribed them not aftir their own deuyce / not in euery pla¦ce thei listed / but in one place / at one altare / and that aftir his own prescript lawes to sa¦crifice / and not any where els to runforthe to strange gods for helpe / lest thei shuld di∣uyd their hertis vnto manye with helpinge gods or saintes as thei be nowe called: but as thei were the membres of one body / so to haue respecte onelye to one god / his lawes onely to obserue and fermelye to perseuer & abyde in vnite and concorde of religiō. And althoughe this peple then beinge vnder the
Iuges did oftē tymes erre & transgresse yet abode thei in that vnite / namely vnder Sa∣muel and Kinge Dauid and in the fyrst ye∣res of king Solomon his raigne. But that firste most vngodly and ambicious herety a Hieroboam dissolued and broke this aunci∣ent intire vnite of that chirch / for he did fyr∣ste set vp the Calues to be worshiped in Dā and Bersaba / inuenting a newe religion & a newe worship for god / that is / euen a strā∣ge worship agenst gods lawe wherby him∣self with his peple were alienated frō God and his trwe worship / he so diuidīg the her¦tis of the peple that thei coude nether depē∣de onely nor wait vpon the onely one God and his lawes / nor yet agree amonge them selues in any ciuile societe.Hiero∣boā the fyrst he¦retyke. The .iij of the kinges ca. xi. & xij. For let our faith ☞and religion be once corrupt diuided & mixt with mens dreamed rites / supersticious ce∣remonies / troublous tradiciōs with armed Actis and articles / and anon there must ne∣dis folowe ciuyle sedicions bataill and stry∣fes as ye may see it this daye begun. And here by the waye / thow shalt knowe that an heretyk is he that by false doctryne or by de¦fendinge the same / diuideth any chirch whi∣che was / or is lykelye to be / wel instituted.who be herety∣kes. But in these troublous contencions and se¦dicious
strifes the pore miserable peple we∣re then greuouslye tormoiled and tormēted vntil the Lorde with the swerde of the Assi∣rions did kutof and made an ende (for that tyme) of their abhominable heresies and scis¦mes / as euē now aftir the thrustinge away of the Gospell graciouslye offced vs / there must nedis folow blody bataill and mutaci∣ons of kinges and realmes as the stories & wordes of the Byble playnly declare. For when Princes feare that the worde of pea∣ce and obedience frely and purely preached wold make mutacion tumulte and sedicions and so for this cause represse the free course therof ether by puttinge the prechers to si∣lence / by banisshing them or burning them / then (be thei sewer) Quod verebantur / hoc accidet illis.Iob. iij. That at thei feared shall come vpon them / the Lord so threatening and ad¦sewering them saing. For as asmich as this people abhorred the swete waters of Silo that flow so still (Silo is the swete gospel of peace sent vs) & hath rather pleasure in this king Rezin & in the sone of Romilus / that is in their wont wiked Romisshe rites and tra¦diciōs:Isa. viij behold / behold saith the Lord / I shall cause the mighty flowdes to swel vp and to breake in vpon them / euen the kinge of the
Assirions / whose parte (aftir the way be ma¦de for him by the ciuyle batails of the christi¦ans emonge them selues) the greate Turke shall play it. Oh Immanuel. Let this therfore be a warninge in tyme to all realmes christen / wherin because the ve∣ry Hieroboams euē the counsails of the Bis¦shops with their captiued seculare armes ha¦ue most heretically & scismatykly with their borowed seclar swerd kut in sondre the most holy vnite and concorde of Christes chirche mangled and hacked into so many decent ri¦tes & laudable (as thei saye) ceremonies &c̄ / by burning and banisshing the fre trwe pre∣chers / holdinge yet fast in their honowr the Popes thorney tradicions and false religiō diuiding the peples hertis from god into a thousande wais / workes / worshipings / me¦rites / saintes to pray with / or for vs (I can not tell whether) some sent to the Bisshops boke for their saluaciō / some to the Actes of the perlement to seke oute their articles of the Popes faith fathered by these sedicious Hieroboams counsail vpon the Kinge & his Nobles / but none do thei sende to the holye Byble / albeit vnder a colowr it be layd in e∣uery parissh Chirch and the curate which e∣ther with an euill wille or els can skant spel
it / commanded to reade it. Because (I saye) these faccious bocherely Hieroboams haue made lyke diuision in our chirches / therfore a lyke swerde (if thei repent not in tyme) a∣bideth them to diuide thir heads from their bodies and their soules from god. But I re¦turne to where I left of. Thē was there yet left in Iudea two trybs whiche worshiped the Lorde at Hierusalem / which peple for al this godly monicion and blody ensample at Israel their neyghbours captyuite / yet dyd theis twe trybs haunt still their newe gods and a newe wais in worshiping their verye God aftir their owne deuices mixt togither with gods prescripte lawes. Wherfore euē those same two trybs also / it behoued into the vengeance taking of their heresy and di¦uision (Heresy (I saye) is a scabbe which diui¦deth christen chirches) to be kut away withe the swerde of the Caldeis.Heresie For so sayd the Lorde oft before by his {pro}phetis. Thus thou seest (good reader) how that stryf and batail☞ folowe the diuision of the vnite of chirches and the corrupcion of religiō: which vngod∣lines / heresyes / and scismes / the swerde of the Turke at laste must kutte clene awaye / when our vnientle Hieroboams wil not suf¦fer the sweet swerde of gods worde peacea∣bly
preched to diuide vs from owr wiked ly¦uinge into the vnite of one faithe onely ther¦by to be iustified / and into one and the same christen religion to be baptized. From the returne out of the Babilonik cap¦tiuite / for a lytle space the Iewes were som¦what more religious / perseuering in the v∣nite of the trwe doctrine. And thē were the∣re Bysshops vnto whose cure the doctryne of the trwthe and vnite of the chirch was cō¦mitted: but aftir that the bisshops neglected the doctryne and began to studie scolde and stryue who shulde bere most rule making al¦tercacion for crownes / myters / diademes / robes / rochettes / bisshopryks and I can tell for what wother popissh paludaments or ra¦ther very nugaments / euē the very badges of their lordly bysshopryks:The he¦resies & scismes aftir the Babilo¦nyk cap¦tiuitie / when bishops ruled. then at laste be∣gane the trwe religion to be shaken in son∣drye and scatred / and euil men were spron∣gen vp / which yet for their shyning hipocry¦sye semed somwhat pope holy / whiche open¦ly stered vp heresyes / that is to saye / sectes and diuisions from the holy tradicion of the lawe / and in conclusion brought the people into varye and diuerse contrarye faccions & scismes Omnia enim plena fiunt impij  vanitas exaltatur inter filios hominū. And
so by their own tradicions and institucions thei derkened and oppressed the holy sacred religion of god / yea by their hipocrysy and supersticion thei vtterly so deformed it / that thei made it abhominable heresye (as thei ha¦ue now done) and new lerning to be lothed & detested of all men / In somiche that Iohn Bapt. and Christe himself now comen / the trwe religion / pure gospell / and the playne doctrine of the trwthe were skant knowne / for that thei were so vtterly deformed & cor∣rupted (as thei be now I saye) with mennis vayn tradicions. This corrupte deformite and abhominable corrupcion began aboute the tyme of the Machabeis and so forth en∣creased the yeres folowinge. For Iosephus verely writing of the Iestes of Ionathas / in the .xiij. boke of his Antiquites / the .viij. chap. saith that in the same tyme there were iij. sectes or heresies emōge the Iewis / whi∣che sectary or hereticall men beleued contra¦ry and ersly of owr iustificacion / of mās state and condicion:iij. sects before christes coming of whiche one was the Pharisaikal secte / the tother / the secte of the Saduceis / and the thirde the Essenes. For these sectes preceded the coming of Christe into flesshe not litle lesse then an .c.xlviij. ye¦res / but in their owne opinions / in their ha∣bits
/ and almoste in all thinges / thei were firste of all amonge themselues / and sone af¦tir from the wother comē sorte / most diuers and most contrary. And thei drewe aftir thē to folowe the same their owne folisshe faci∣ons very many / in somich that at laste euen the priests and full many of the greatest ler∣ned descēded into their orders and instituts For we haue herdeoute of the testimony of Iohn theuangelist / the Leuites and priestes to haue bene pharisais / yea ond the Apostle Paul said himself to haue had ben the moste straightest folower of the pharisayes secte / so that what soeuer was sene to these mē to be ordined enacted and decreed (as ye see it nowe) in thinges concerninge the faith and religion of god / it was decreed enacted and made so fast of them that noman might saye agenst it / and it was setforthe and geuen of the priests to all the peple for gods law and for his decrees / and were called the decente rites of their fathers and laudable tradiciōs of their elders / of which tradiciōs Paul in∣cidently maketh menciō in the .i. chap. to the Galathiās / and Mat. in the .xv. chap.Ioan. i.Gala. i.Philip. iij.The tra¦dicions of the pharises fathers. The∣se pharisais wolde be exalted and excell the more in autorite & glory for that their own tradicionsmat. xvPhari∣seis. rytes and ceremonies aftir their
own pleasure inuēted semed aftir their own corrupt iugemente to them selues and to o∣ther lyke / lesse then other mens instituciōs to varye from the holy scriptures. Their cō∣uersacion and outward lyuing semed sober abiect / and as though thei wolde be litle set by / geuinge themselues to no excesse nor to no dilicate superfluite nor superfluous dain¦tyes. Thei beleued althingis to be caried of fortune / chaunce / and destiney (as thei call it) but yet in the meā ceason free liberty thei toke not fro man. These aknowleged the iugement of god / the paynes of the euil and rewardes of the good / thei confessed the im¦mortalite of soules and the resurreccion of the bodies. Some saye thei had their name of phares which signifieth to se{per}ate or diui∣de for thei shewed thēselues in their hole ha¦bit and lyuing to be holier then the comō pe¦ple / and so for their pure holynes to be diui¦ded from them (as nowe of late were / & yet be / owr pharisais) some then into cloisters / and some yet into collegis / wearing distinct aparel and shauen crownes from the layite. Some thinke thei had their names of a no∣ther hebrew worde whiche signifieth to ex∣plane and interprete scripturs / for thei we∣re the cheif and moste busyest prechers & te∣chers
of the peple / which thing I beleue the more / because the story of the gospell decla∣reth our Lorde often tyme to haue had refu∣ted their false gloses vnwriten verites and vntrwe exposicions / playn examples there ar setforth in Mat. v. and .xv. chapt Forther¦more / the Saduceis wold apere to kepe no nother obseruacions besyds the law of Mo∣ses / these gaue nothing to fortune and desti¦nye / but to the free lybertye thei attributed althinges.Sadu∣ceis. For thei threw althings subiecte vnder owr own power / aknowleginge owr owne selues to be the autors of good wor∣kes. Thei denyed to be any spirits and aun∣gels and the resurreccion of the dead / which thing Luke in the actis of the apostles shew¦eth / and therfore were thei estiewed of the pharisais as men most vile and vnpure / and thus was there perpetuall stryfe betwixte them both.xxiij. ca Wherof euen the sory miserable vnlerned peple was so wrapped and intri∣cated in their stryffes and diuersite of their inuented dreamis that not onely thei might not vnwrap and lose themselues out of the∣se perplex tryfles / but thei were made igno¦rāt of the very right and trwe way of their iustificacion and of the trwe waye of their saluacion / which rightwyse making onelye
by faith and trwe wais of saluacion thorow Christe onely / when Iohn Bapt. and chryst and his apostles wold repare declare & shew them playnly and openly / then thei reputed and toke them for siche haynous heretiques preching agenst them / that there was neuer no kynde of doctryne so bitterly refused / un¦pugned / thrust from them / and dampned of the pharisais and saduces as was christis ho¦ly & trwe prechinge / in this mischeif thei cō¦sented / although thei neuer agreed emonge them selues in their doctryn. For neuer had Christe owr Lorde and christis verite more {per}nicious enymies (as ye yet see it this day) then the Pharisais and Saduceis. And as for the Essenes / who so lyste to see them in their owne lyuely colours paynted / let him loke but on a Monke of the charture house / or a fryer obseruāt / whom Plinye paynteth very lyuely in his fyrste boke of the natural storyes ca. xvij. and Iosephus in his .xviii. boke of thātiquites ca. ij. and in his .ij. boke of the Iewes batail cap. vij.Esse∣nes. Nowe compare the state of their tyme to owr tyme and to owr pharisais.Of the vnite & Scisme of chri∣stē chir∣ches. But yet (christē reader) that thou mightest the clearlyer by comparinge togither / vnderstand this hole cause and ma¦ter of the sectis of the Iewes / thowe muste
know those heresyes to be very lyke the sec¦tis and heresyes whiche in these laste dayes haue ben / and yet ar sprongenvp in the chir¦che of christe. Christe with his apostles deli¦uered to vs the doctryne of vnite / that is to weit / onely helthe & saluacion to be setforth in him onely / which alone is owr iustificaci∣on / holymaker / satisfaccion / euen that hoost once alone for all offerd vp for owr synnes / owr mediator / intercessor / and to be shorte / he alone is vnto his faithful chirch althings and in althingis. He cōmanded his apostles to glewe togither his chirche by this perfit doctrine of vnite into one bodye / and by his Baptisme and Brede brekīge to gather thē togither nowe conseigned and sealed vp to¦gither / so to seke allthings in thonely sone of God / that thei emonge themselues tho∣row loue might consent and godly agree be¦ing all one thinge in christe / and that there be no dissencions nor sectis in his chirch / vn¦to no creatures being addict vnto none but to christe hir spouse dedicatinge hirself / whē nether Paul nor Peter was crucified for hir nor she hirselfe baptized into the names of any men. This doctrine of vnite / those same goodmen which in times past professed and taught it / and by the same doctryne conser∣ued
the vnite / the christē chirches held them for catholyk and faithfull / but the aduersa∣ries and fyghters agenst this doctryne and vnite thei toke them for heretiques.The ca∣tholike and he∣retyk. And so for certayne .C. yeres the chirch was conser¦ued in the euangelik vnite by the godlynes erudicion / and diligent watche of the faith∣full flockfeders of christe / whom thei called bisshops. But aftirward whē these bisshops (this doctryne of the vnite neglected) begā to scolde and brawle aboute (I can not tell what) tryfles questions of naughte / and to bende and applye their ambicious myndes to be lordes and occupy kingdom / thorow their satanicall altercacions and most pesti∣ferous prophane ambicion / the doctryne of vnite was smiten oute of wynt. For then sa¦tisfaccions / wilworks / good deadis / money and mennes merites bought and solde begā to be bosted and preched for men to come to heuē by them / wherby the merite of christis passiō was blotted out of mēnis brestis and mēnis hertis were diuided in sondre. Then was it disputed (as ye haue sene it of late in owr parleaments and conuocacions) of the intercession and prayinge to saints / and of their worshiping (god saue it) and of the ve¦neracion of images and reliques / of purga∣tory
/ vnwriten verites / of Kinges autorite and power ouer gods holy euerlasting wor¦de / of gay significacions for decent ceremo∣nies and laudable rytes / of preistis vowes / Sacraments / and I can not tell what: and whether thei might be sewerlyer stablisshed by mortall menis transitory new vayne ac∣tes / then by the olde euerlastinge worde of the euer lyuinge god. Here of lo / ar the her∣tes of the faithfull thus abstracte from the doctryne of vnite / that thei seke not althin∣gis at / and in christe: yea and in those lyke dayes of disceptacion paste / there enfolow∣ed the diuisiō of the weste empery from the easte / and that euen for the worshipinge of images. Thē the Monkes with all the false religious rablemēt thrusted in them selues whiche with their dirtye doctryne cōfirmed faste this forsaid defecciō and affall / encrea¦singe the same with newe addicions and to∣puttings / and odious ordināces out of their nwne sike heads deuillisshly dreamed. The∣se mōstrese mōks and flatering fryers (with their Poped and Cardinaled holy bisshops and shauelings assisting them) inuēted and caryed into the chirche newe fathers / newe rules / newe vowes / newe felowships and false fraternities / newe wiked worships /
newe names / newe Sacraments / newe cere¦monies rytes tradiciōs / yea and a newe god to / and to be breif / all newe and all agēst the olde holye scriptures / so that if thou wolust seke for the olde institucions of God thow shalt nowhere in their new doctrine of diui∣sion fynde their propper names / and yet (by your leaue) these Monks with their shauen sorte / as thei differ and discorde in habite / a∣parell and in their lyuing / so did thei yet ne¦uer agree amonge themselues in their doc∣tryne. For thei fyght one agenste another / thei haat / thei curse and bāne eche other / but agēst chryst thei be all one. The peple folow their faccions / doctrynes and actis made as thei lyfte / and is kut and diuided into more then a thousand peeses. These fryerly flyes monkisshe monsters / and busye blynde bys∣shops (their counsell gathered) decree what thei lyste / and defende it with the seculare swerde / then thei cause it to be often in the yere red and preched to all the world and re¦ceyued payne of death / and with these their owne dead dreames ar the miserable mortal men implexed and masshed / yea and so mad∣ded / that as thei can not vnderstande their newe strange termed scolastik doctryne and vntrwe theologie / so can thei not know the
holsome playn doctryn and trwe diuinite of Christe and his apostles. For whyls thei be set of these blynde goydes into a thousande wais / by misses / by vowes / by intercessiō of saintes / by pardons / satisfaccions / by & tho∣row purgatory / yeretids / mōthids / by their owne works and other mens merits and all for money / the pore wretches not knowing christe the very waye / nor ones so hardye to open their lippis / to reason agenst them / but secretly lamenting their miserable ignorāce ar thruste headlōgs into hel with these their beastly blynd leders. In the mean tyme if a∣ny man come sente from God and desire the doctryn of vnite to be brought in agene pre¦ching the olde and onelye waye by Christe / yea if he in any wyse dissent from their opi∣nions lately receiued of blynde fools (for a∣genst the trwe doctryn as sayth the prophet thei haue coniured and sworen) vpon him a∣none thei laye busy waite / & for because thei chalenge to themselues the lordly censure & cruell correccion of the doctrine in the chirch anon thei send owt enquirours to fetche thē in to be prisoned and brent. By these edders spirituall spume the way of the trwthe and vnite is blasphemed: nether ar ther this day lyuing more pernicious pestilent enymyes
to the vnite of the chirche and to the christen doctryne then this serpentyne sead oute of whose mouthes continuallye the spightfull lothely names of heretiks and heresyes and new lerning ar forth vomited and out spew¦ed into euery disshe vpon their tables. Tho∣row these dronken crownis of Ephraim / by their own pleasante opinions / by their own consaighted doctrine and sworne tradicions the trowth of the gospel and of the apostles is obscured and oppressed daily. Now (good reader) thow seest (I thinke) how properlye the tymes before christes incarnacion / and now this laste time before his coming to iu∣gement agree to gither and be correspondēt for in ether of them / heretyks & sectesowers did runne and preek before him / miserablye kutting into peeses and pituously pollutīg the chirche of God. But bothe of them / the Lorde at his cominge reueleth openeth and destroyeth / and his own chirche he reduceth into the righte waye defendeth and delyue∣reth it mightely. Now therfore nedis muste the Turke (the waye firste prepared for him by yowr owne blody persecucion of the iust and by intestyn batail) come in and make an ende of these your heresies and scismes. For there is nether Emperowr no Kinge that
will yet suffer them / when good occasyon & oportunite was offerd them / to be reformed in their chirches and vnite and christen reli∣gion to be restored in their tyme. Here thou seest (good reader) who in the chirche be had for faithfull / and who for heretikis. Who be faithful & who be here¦tyks. Euery trwe faithfull / is he that professeth trwlye the doctrine of vnite / and in the onely holye chirch grounded vpō chryst he onely aknow¦legeth christe the verye flokfeder & sauiour / althings reposing into christe / althinges of christe askinge / and besydes christe he know¦eth no parte of saluacion nor helpe or hope of lyfe to be loked for / onely of the voice of his shepherde depending / chosinge nothing oute of himself nor out of any mans inuen∣cion to folow it as a mean to his saluacion. But whoso folowth the cōtrary / he is an he¦retike & a scismatyk / namely if he be incura∣ble and pertinate stiffe in his owne false opi¦niō and will not fall from creatures to chri∣ste onely / from lyes and vayne fryuole tra∣dicions with their vnsauerye significacions fained of men / vnto the trowth and gospell of Iesu Christe / but entyse and wrap other men withe himself into the same errours.

Here may ye see by christis & Ioans ensam∣ples to be lawfull for prechers sharply to re¦buke grete mens open crymes:Greate mennis crymes must be opēly re¦buked. but to flater and dissemble with them it is not lawefull. Awaye therfore with these flateringe ypo∣crites which cry oute saing. The crymes and synnes of great men & noble prelates muste be kouered with Noes cloke Gene. ix. For in the scriptures it is inueyed of gods owne spirit more vehemenly and sharplier agenst the euil prelates and worse heades ouer the peple thē agenst the sely subiectes. For the∣se simpilons erre not vtterlye of their owne faute / but by the euill ensamples and synful techinge of their prelates & naughty liuing of their rulers & magistrates whiche seduce
the laye people of the Lorde. Wherfore the more sinne steketh in thē the more greuous∣ly to be tormēted / as ye may see it in the .vi. chapter of the boke of Wysedome / whiche wold god the Magistratis wold with feare laye before their eyes. Ye see now in this ty¦me verely how that by the beastlye idlenes / malice and vngodlines of the bisshops prei∣stes and seclare monkes with the negligēce of their captiued seclare sorte / the chirche of Christe erreth and strayethe farre from the waye of the trwthe greuously labouring in heuye paynes oppressed of tyranous perse∣cutors: and thorowe the faute of these men cheifly / Peters pore lytle fysshinge bote is almoste ouerwhelmed with the terrible tem¦pestuous soden sourges. Right well therfor do thei which plucking the visar from their faces / shew their abhominacion to the peple sharplye rebukinge their vngodlines / that these ypocrits once known / mē may be war of them and their doctryne.Howe the pre∣lates & Magi∣strates shulde be rebu¦ked. Rebuke thē ther¦fore for the zele thou hast to the trwth to the glory of god and to thy brothers saluacion. And let thy libertye in speking be the liber∣tye of the free benigne spirit / & rebuke not of malice aftir the fleshly licēce of thy nown affected mynde. Lette the wordis and wry∣tingis
of the ministers of the trwthe be pru¦dent rather then bolde / graue and not lyght ardent not in yre and wrath but in the vehe∣mence of the spirit of god / let them be sham∣faste modeste in a iust seuerite tempred with holy deuocion and deuoute holines so longe as thou seest them not in a desperat state ob∣stinatly and openly stifnecked agenste gods worde fyghting / wetingly to synne agenst the holy goste. But yet be thou (as Christe ordined the) the salte of the erthe / that is / let thy wordes be quik liuely and sharpe in thy sermons and ernest in thy rebukis / be salte sauory and no waterisshe beet.Mat. v For constan∣cy and liberty in speking conciliateth & ioy∣neth autorite to the minister / be feruente as Isaye and Paul bid the / although some cold softlings and menpleasars earetulers syni∣strely interprete thy zelous constant feruen¦cy to be folissh rasshnes.Isaye. lviij.ij. timo iiij. Tell them that god is no slowe auenger of euill / he is no insen∣sible stock but as full of eyes as Argos and as clere eyed as the lysarde or slowe worme presentlye and thorowlye beholding them. Pharisais Hypocrits and Epicures promes thēseues securite and long lyf / but tell thou them with Ioan bapt. that the axe is nowe laid to the tree root. Which presente wrathe
the Lorde in Luke expresseth sainge. Wo be to womē with childe and to the soukgeuers with their nieples in these dayes / for there shalbe great afflicciō vpon the erthe & wrath vpon this peple. For thei shalbe smitēdown with the edge of the swerde / and shall be led captiue into among all the strange nacions. And Ierusalem / that is thei that ar now na∣med christians shalbe trodēdown of the hei∣then Turkes. Let vs nowe therfore in tyme (christen bretherne) fere the lord and walke in his precepts / not promising ourselues a∣ny securite or longe life in this our corrup∣cion and synnes / for God owr iuste iuge is awake. This therfore is my cownsell / euen to do penance / that is turne quiklye and er∣nestly vnto owr Lord God / and to confesse our synnes to him / amend owr liues and to serue him in holines & rightwisnes / for the∣se ar the frutes of a repentant herte / whiche herte thorow faith hathe now trwly cōsecra¦ted and geuen herself ouer wholl to god.The way in∣stituted of God to mo∣ue vs to repen∣tance. But firste let vs take away the impedimēts of trwe repentāce / as ar securite of lōge life the opinion of owr owne ryghtwysnes by good workis / faith and truste in vayne lies &c̄. And then teche nothing els to be in owr selues but poison synne and corrupciō / and
that in god onely we haue lyfe and saluaciō which is not apeaced with externe worship∣ings and workes dreamed oute of owr own headis. Then thonderforthe the feare of the terrible iugemente of god at hande and his present wrath and indignacion redye to be powred down from heuen vpon all vnright wysnes. If these things be taught and recei¦ued and the wother impediments remoued / we be sone conuerted to god onely / workīg the very godly repentāce in the fere of god / or els is the axe layid to the root of the tree / that is to saye / destruccion and dethe daunse p̄sent before thy dore / so that now ther is no hope to the of any lenger life. For aslonge as there is anye hope of frute in trees / thei dunge the roots / rubof the mosse / kutof the sere branches / but it is the token of the laste desperacion of any frute whē the axe is laid to the root / to the root he saithe & not to the body or branches / signifying a soden reme∣diles downfall. For the root kutt in sondre / the tree is dead. Repent ye therfore and re∣ceiue the gospell / or els stretcheforthe your neckis vnto the axe bent ouer your heades. For this is sewer that the wrath of the lord which shall smite you down by the rootis hā¦geth ouer your shauen crownes. For euery
tree that bringethe not forthe good frute is kut downe. He saith not / shalbe kutdowne / for his iugement and dampnaciō to present. We be trees planted of the Lorde into this ende / euē to beare and bringforth good fru∣te / that is good workis / yea and that by the heuenly iewce & moister of owr Lord Chri∣ste. These ar the frutes of the spirit / as faith and trwth &c̄ / of the whiche aftir Isaye had writē / Paul often times repete the same na¦mely to the Galathens to the Ephe. &c̄.Isay. v.Gala. v.Ephe. iiij. Vn¦to this place laye the .xiij. of Luke and .xv. of Ioan and thou haste a playn exposicion ther¦of. Of all these wordis may we lerne the ve¦ry trwe good workis to be requyred of eue∣ry of vs / and not figge leaues of our owne patching togither to kouer our shamful na∣kednes as did Adam and Eue / not the glit∣tering shewe of godlines / but euē godlines innocency and christen religiō in ded. Agen we lerne herof the heuye vengeance of god to be redy prepared for all sinfull vngodlye men / yea and that the most certayn vēgeāce and wrath / left any man dirst promise him∣self to escape vnpunisshed for the contempt of the most highe God. Longsuffering dou¦teles is the lord / but yet in the mean ceason he is rightwyse and an aduenger not ouer¦flowe
nor to slak. And nowe to warne the in tyme / here haste thou which is trwe repē¦tance and which is false: and how we may a∣uoid the imminente plages to be caste vpon vs by the incursions of the Turks with wo∣ther plages imminent / that is if from the bo¦tome of our hertie we be conuerted vnto the Lorde amending owr corrupte maners / no∣thing douting of the mercy of our god. For this is once full of counforte / that christe ca∣me to call sinners to repentance and not thē that semed iuste in their own eyes. The pha¦risais / scrybes / and saduceis as ar now owr antichristē spiritualte with their captiued se¦culare / were the most desperate vngodly as Christe and Ioan bapt. well knew them / & yet thei both / exhorted them to repentance / Christe called them to him promising them forgeuenes if their penance were trwe. Let vs not therfore despeire of forgeuenes / nor castawaye and condempne a man neuer so synfull and cryminous except his synne be vnto death.i Ioā in the last chapt. For God our father is Ientle & of an infinite mercye constante and trwe of his promises as ye see in Iere. and Ezechie. xviij. chap. At laste that thou maiste knowe what is trwe repētance and to stere the ther vnto / let this be the diffinicion therof. Re∣pentance
or penance is a turning or conuer¦sion vnto the Lorde god / wherby we / of the syncere feare of god humbled / aknowelege our synnes / and all our whole life we make newe.Penāce what it is. This diffiniciō hath certain cheif prin¦cipals / oute of the which / the hole nature of penāce shalbe fullier expressed and known. Fyrst thou hearest it called a turninge / and because it is not a turninge to what soeuer dead satisfacciō or creature thou lyftest / ther¦fore is it added vnto the lorde god / for so re∣dest thou it in Ieremye. Israel / if thou wilte be returned / be returned vnto me / saithe the Lorde.The tur¦ning to God. Here is excluded all turnings to sain¦tis and to any wother creature / agene / here is included the turning away from lyes frō the deuill & the turning to the trwth. Whe∣re it is playne that here it behoueth to haue the doctryne of trwth which must shewe vs who is god to whom we must be conuerted / what is good & trwe / to the which we must be turned / and what is euill and false from whiche we oughte to be auerted / and to be breif what must be amended and howe. For this cause the prophetis and apostles exhor∣tinge men to penance / longe and miche do cleaue / tarye / and labour in the descripciō of the nature of god / in his goodnes rightwys¦nes
verite & mercy / in describinge the lawes to liue wel and in the offices of men / and al∣so in the sinnes of men to be accused opened and exaggered or throne vpō heaps as thus to be shewed many and greuous / then thei throwto threateninge & menacings laid be∣fore their eyes with the terrible and horri∣ble syght of the iugement of god to be at hā∣de: in whiche all / the syncere fear of god (the spirit of god workinge togither in owr her∣tes) is stered vp / so that nowe with reuerēce we fear god iustly being āgry with vs / whi∣che ar verely alto corrupted / yea we be not els then the stinking canell and sinfull sinke of all synne and mischeif.the fear of god. But this feare of god wherof we here speake is called syncere into the difference of that fear which casteth downe into desperacion. For syncere feare / out of herself bringeth forth euen the verye trew offices and dedis of repentance / name∣ly the confession and aknowleginge of syn∣nes. Nether is it enoughe to haue herde thy self to be a synner and god to be angry with the / onlesse thow confessest thyself to be euē siche one and offcest vp thy self standing be∣fore god in iugement / that is to saye onlesse thyself now humbled before god in his pre∣nce diffidest & distrustest thy nown right∣wysnesThe cō∣fessiō of synnes & humi∣liacion.
whiche thou seest to be the most cor¦rupt / and aknowlegest thyself to be euē the very most bonde man of sinne & dethe. This confessiō of synnes and humbling of thyself Ieremy requiring / in his .viij. chap. saithe. There was not one that repēted him of his euill doing saing. What haue I done? But this aknowleging of thy synnes hathe a so∣rowe and heuines annexed / for the trwe re∣penters sorow and lament that euer thei ha¦ue offended so benigne and ientle a father / and that thei haue cōmitted so greuous syn¦nes which could not be forgeuen but by the bloudsheding of his  sone so innocente a lombe.Heuy∣nes. Nowe may thy herte bld for thy synnes beholden in the deathe and bloudye woundis of christe. Here here dothe this so∣rowfull heuines / this aknowleging / & hum¦bled herte / expresse the fre confessiō of thy synnes and the humble askinge forgeunes of thy trespassis. And now forberse Repē¦tance is the conuersiō vnto god and not the turning away from him / therfore hath this humiliacion and confession now a great mā¦ly faith & a large hope.The cō∣fessiō of sin with faithe & hope. For this sinner thu confessing casteth and geueth himselfe ouer into the mercy of god / and downe vpon his knees he asketh mekely forgeuenes of him
whom he now accouraged and ēstruct with the promises of god / dowteth not to be mer¦cyfull to all siche confessours. On this ma∣ner euery where in the Psalmes the penitē∣tes so praye that euery man might see bothe to confesse and expresse their faith & to trust also in the trowth and rightwysmakinge of god thorow christe. For penance with owte faith firste beholdinge christes passion is of none effecte / but pernicious and deadlye / as it apereth in the penance of Iudas / wherof Paul speaketh thus.False penāce The heuines whiche is godly aftir gods will / that bringeth forthe holsom repentance neuer to be repēted:ij. Cor. vij. but cōtrary / the worldly heuines bringeth deth: and thus therfore we conclude. Penance to be the conuersion vnto god / wherby we out of the syncere feare of god humkled / a know¦lege and confesse owr synnes neuer to be cō¦mitted agen. Now there folowth the tother cheif principall belongīg to penance / which is the innouacion of thy wholl lyfe.The in∣nouaciō of thy life. Thei ve¦rely which feare god and haue felt his iuge∣ments and mercye / maye not make a lyghte thing nor litle regard their synnes vnto the which thei haue hitherto maried themselues but thei know that thei must vtterly abhor∣re and deteste them / occupyinge themselues
moste holely in godly thoughtis words and works / before althings fighting all their li∣ues kinge agenst the world the deuil & their fleshe For penāce is not the worke of a few dayes / but the perpetuall custody of the life and the euerlasting study to liue innocētly. Also the works done of the penitēt & of the new lyuers ar called the frutes of penance / and works worthei penance / of which / cheif¦ly ar the mortyfying of the flesshe & the stu∣dy to lyue vertuouslye / the batail with syn∣nes / watche / fasting / prayer / alms / paciēce / abstinēce with like frutes of the spirit.The fru¦tes of penāce. Paul nowmbrīg like work of trew penāce saith.ij. Cor. vij. This worke euē to be heuey & sorowfull as god asketh it how great care hath it brought forth? yea what a satisfacciō? indignaciō & dis¦pleasure? what zele? what feare? desier? & ven¦geāce? Firste lo penāce or the heuines cōcei∣ued of the holy goste begetteth in you (saithe he) care / that is the study & most careful cure and diligēt hede taking lest ye be polluted a¦gen with those filthinesses frō which by the grace of god ye be pourged / thē he addeth / that this godly heuines begetteth Satisfac∣ciō / that is the excusaciō or clēsing from syn:Godly heuy∣nes what frute it brīgeth forthe. for so mich signifieth the greke worde Apo∣logia / which Paul there vseth / adding ther∣to.
Euery where ye haue goten yourselues praise because ye be pure in this behalf. Thē there folowth Indignaciō / that is the verye vehemēt wrath & displeasure to yourselues for your cryme cōmitted and for your moste shamelesse filthines / for with repētāce / owr own shame begineth: vnto the which / feare is ioined / euē the cōtinual feare of god. For the neglecting and litle regarding of god is the cause of miche abhominaciō. Also there folowth desier / which cōteineth louing pro∣misessis to do good / & an erneste feruour to godward / wherof Dauid speking saith. As the hunted hert desyereth the fresshe waters so desyereth my soul my liuing god. There is added / zele / that is an ardēt study & imita∣cion to attayn and set hold vpō the most ho∣nest wais of liuing. At last thee stādeth vē∣geāce / for he that thus is displesed with him¦self & punissheth his body mortifying it for his sinnes / that mā verely scourgeth his bo¦dy being auēged therof for so boldly & prow¦dely resisting the spirit of god fyghtinge a∣genst his flesshe. Thismiche hast thou of the nature of Repentāce / which thou maist well diuyde into opē and priuate penance / . Opē penance is opēly receiued for opē sinnes / as to be smitē opēly with manifest famin / peste¦lence
or batail / of which thou hast an elegāt exāple Ionas .iij. & Ioele .ij. and in diuers o∣ther places of the holy scripturs. Priuate pe¦nance is that at euerye man receiueth of his own mynde the holy gost so / to do / excitinge him wherby the worde of trweth herde / the herte is pricked with remorse for his secrete and open synnes to / which he lamenting cō¦uertethe vnto God: of this penance / manye right fayer and holye ensamples ye haue in the olde and newe Testamente / but cheiflye of Dauid .ij. Reg. xij. of Achab. iij. of Kingis xxi. of Manasses .ij. para. xxxiij. of Mathew Mat. ix. of the synfull woman Luke .vij. of Zachey Luke .xix. of Peter Mat. xxvi. and Ioan .xxi. and of the Iewes Act. ij. Of the penance / confession / and fonde fassi∣ons of satisfccions / which aftir the tyme of the Apostles / aboute the tyme of Cypriane and Councel of Nece and so folowing some fathers did thruste into their chirchis / I wil not here greatly reason ne wryte / because I am full assewered / the doctryne of the apos∣tles / to be perfecte enoughe / so that whoso will walk aftir their lanterne he shall walk in the sufficient lyght and not in derkenes. Nowe at laste / as ye see Baptisme to go be∣fore the Lordes Souper / so see ye synne to
precede Penance and bothe the sacraments / Paul exhorting eueryman to proue and ex∣amyn himselfe ere he eate of this breade and drinke of this cuppe / whiche texte how wic∣edly the Bisshops haue translated in their boke in the .xxxix lefe all men may see it.i. cor. xi Al∣so synne precedeth Baptisme / for we be con¦ceiued and borne in synne / and who wold be wasshen except he were fowle?
