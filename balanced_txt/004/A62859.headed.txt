To the Right Honourable Bulstrode Whit∣lock Serjeant at Law, John Lisle Esq Richard Keble Serjeant at Law, Lords Commissioners of the Great Seal of England; Major Generall Thomas Har∣rison; Edmund Prideaux Esq Atturney General for the State. OUt of a love to truth, and respect to my Engage∣ment by Solemn Covenant I framed, and out of desire to prevent (if possible) the oppression of men, for holding a truth, I printed (some years since) Two Treatises and an Appendx to them, and after that an Apology for them, with a Postscript; which were presented to some of your hands by me. Finding that great hatred is against such as dissent from the Assemblies de∣terminations, specially in the two points of Baptism, & Disci∣pline, (which this writing treats of;) and those that shelter them from violence; and that a great part of the quarrel between England and Scotland is, for not establishing Presbyterial Government, with rigour, which is thus ex∣pressed in the Scottish Assemblies Reply to the  Declara∣tion, Edius. 22. Julii 1650. Sess. 17. That Jesus Christ be Lord over his own house, and that his Ministers keep Courts and ex∣ercise Jurisdiction and discipline, and all the censures of the Kirk from the lowest to the highest, in his name only, against all that depart from and do oppose the truth; or that walk loosely as doth not become the Gospell: and hoping this writing to one of the Chief Presbyterians in Scotland▪ may contribute something to discover the unreasonablenesse of their violent proceed∣ings in their way; and some Truths, not commonly dis∣cerned;
I have yielded to the publishing thereof, in this sad time of a bloody warre, raised much from the foremen∣tioned hatred. Such as it is, I humbly present to your Honours, in testi∣mony of my thankfulnesse for the favour and pitty to me, vouchsafed by some of your Honors in conferring on me, & others in being eminently instrumental in the quiet settling of me in this place; in which, after plunderings, and many tossings up and down, I have had some abiding: wherein I still endeavour to be serviceable to the publique, and to acquit my self Your Honours humble and devoted Servant, JOHN TOMBES. Ledbury-Hospitall in Herefordshire Sept. 4. 1650.
To the Reverend the Moderator and Commissioners in the next Nationall Assembly of the Church of Scotland, or the next Provincial Assembly unto which Glasgow in the Kingdome of Scotland belongs; the Com∣plaint of John Tombes Presbyter, Humbly sheweth, THat in pursuance of the SOLEMNE COVENANT taken by me to endeavour reformation in Gods worship, ac∣cording the word of God; I published Two Treatises a∣bout INFANT-BAPTISME at London December 15. 1645. and an APOLOGY for them in August 1646. d that in the year 1647. a book intituled ANA∣BAPTISME was published at London, by ROBERT BAYLY Mini∣ster of Glasgow: wherein I was wronged by many grievous false accusa∣tions: concerning which I have (as near as I could,) followed the rule of Christ Ma. 18. 15, 16, 17. as may be perceived by the close of the letter to Mr. BAYLY himself: For after I had advertised him by Mr. Henry Sddr, of the injury he had done me, I wrote to him July 22. 1647. which letter was delivered to Mr. Samuel Rutherford Sept. 17. 1647. with Directions how to send back. And in the year 1649. I wrote a letter to Mr. Rutherford, to certify me what became of my wri∣ting delivered to him? with desire to know what Mr. BAYLY would do to right me; yet after so long waiting, I find no remorse or righting of me made by the said Mr. ROBERT BAYLY: And therefore I do de∣volve the matter into your hands, being taken for the Church, to which such complaints should be made, according to the rule Mat. 18. 17. and do expect to have right done by you to him and me, as to a Fellow-Christi∣an,—Presbyter,—and Covenanter with you, as is meet in such a cause concerning the truth of God, and innocency of your Brother. And for∣asmuch as the charge against him and proof may be evidently seen in this letter to him, and his and my writings, (which [if you please to take no∣tice of,] you may easily come by;) I presume you will not expect my per∣sonal appearance before you to pursue this Complaint: but of your selves examine the matter, as I conceive the rule of Christ binds you; besides the engagements towards a Fellow-Covenanter in the sixth article of the Solmne League and Covenant: and permit your fellow-servant to attend the work of Christ, in the place where he is seated; who shall pray for your welfare; and continue Your brothor and Fellow-Servant in Christ, JOHN TOMBES. London Sept. 24. 1650.
To the Reverend, Mr. Samuel Rutherfurd Professor at St. An∣drews in Scotland. SIR, ANno 1647. was delivered to you a letter of mine to Mr. Robert Bayly of Glasgow your fellow-Commissioner, which you undertook as I am told to send to him, and not hearing any thing from Mr. Bayly in answer to it, An∣no 1649. I sent a letter to you to itreate a word from you, what became of that letter with directions to what place in London your letter might be sent for me; of which likewise I have heard nothing. Forasmuch as without publishing something a blot inde∣lible may lie on me and (which is more) on the truth I assert for my sake, and that in after ages when Mr. Bayly's book shall be read, and those false criminations found therein without any Vindication of mine, and I per∣ceive by experience that such false reports as have been vented in Mr. Ed∣wards his Gangrn (upon whose credit Honorius Reggius hath blazed them in a Latin writing) and in Mr. Bayly's Disswasives have made ma∣ny men undeservedly odious, and such reports vented in pulpits upon their credit have been the bellowes that did blow the fire of warre, which hath to the rejoicing of Malignants and grief of godly persons wasted your and our Countrey, and Mr. Cotton of N. E. thought meet to print an Apology for himself and the Churches there to vindecate himself from Mr. Bayly's aspersions in one part of his disswasive, I have thought it necessary to vin∣dicate my self in this, and have sent it to you, being one that I conceive cordially affected with the breaches that are among the Godly & studious of truth and peace, that you may impart this as you may opportunely to some Synod in your Countrey, and indeavour, as conscience and Covenant I think bind you, in the most prudent way you can to take of the injury of Mr Bayly; and which is the chief thing I aim at and humbly desire, that there may be some Course taken effectually to prevent such injurious mis∣representations of mens tenents, and practises in pulpits and presses, that so (if the Lord shall vouchsafe such a mercy) dissenters at last may in a calme and amicable way debate differences to the healing of our breaches: which is the prayer and aime of Lemster in Hereford∣shire Decem. 4. 1651. Your Fellow-Servant and Brother in Christ, JOHN TOMBES.

To the reverend and worthy Master ROBERT BAYLIE, Minister at GLASGOW in SCOTLAND. SIR, IN your Book intituled ANABAPTISMI, you charge me falsly in these following Accusations chap. 4. page 92. you say, in these following things he flies as high, as any civil and discreet Anabaptist I have met with. 1. In spoyling Christian infants not only of Baptisme, but of all interest in the Covenant of Grace. And in the margine, and Table in the end of your book, you say, He spoyles all infants of all inte∣rest in the Covenant of Grace. 2. In making Circumcision a seal to the Jews onely of earthly and tem∣poral priviledges. 3. In denying to Jewish infants all right to the new Covenant, till in their riper years they become actuall believers. SECT I. Of the first Crimination, that I spoile all Infants of all inte∣rest in the Covenant of Grace. To prove these accusations which you so expresly charge me with, and tend to make your adversary odious, (which it seems you made
your businesse, and not to clear truth;) you referre the Reader to the let∣ters A A page 110. where you cite one passage of my Apology page 64. which doeth directly deny the first accusation, and where the passage of Mr. Marshall you alledge for proof of it, (a most unreasonable way to prove a mans position by his Antagonists conceit of it, as, that Calvin made God the author of sin, because Bellarmin accused him of it,) is sufficiently an∣swered: yea in my Post script to Mr. Blake in the end of my Apology Sect. 22. I charge Master Blake of unjust crimination of me in this, and challenge Mr. Marshall, Mr. Vines, Mr. Calamy, and now your self to make good that charge if you can. And yet you are not ashamd to say, pag. 113. All our adversaries deny to all infants all right in God, all in∣terests in his promises, and Covenant, as much as they do to Turks, and Pagans. And chap. 4. page 89, 90. after you had charged this accusa∣tion on others; in the close you say, This makes them uncertain what to say of infants dying before conversion. Some save them all, (which is con∣trary to what you say page 133;) others incline to the damnation of them all; others professe the uncertainty of the thing, whether infants before their conversion be within the Kingdome of Satan, or that of God. And for proof of this last you referre the Reader to the letter K; and there you alledge my words in my Apology page 64, 66. which speak not at all of the uncertainty of the thing you were speaking of, to wit, the salvation or damnation of infants dying before conversion, but the contrary, saying expresly, That every infant is either in the visible Kingdome of God, or of Satan, that is, elect, or reprobate. And for the certainty of the subject, I conceive neither you nor I, nor any on earth are certain what child of a Believer is elect, or reprobate. Sure I am Mr. Marshall in his Sermon page 48▪ saith, Charity is not tyed to conclude certainly of any of them, although in the beginning of his Sermon page 7. he would ground the sal∣vation of all the infants of believers dying in their infancy, on Gods promise, to be the God of Believers, and of their seed. Besides, my words in my A∣pology page 64, 66. which you alledge, speak onely of infants belonging visibly to the Kingdome of the Devil or God; and I still deny that they belong to either visibly, untill they make their profession, accord∣ing to the constitution of the visible Church of Christians, which it be∣hoved you to disprove, and not to misreport my words as you do.
SECT. II. Of the second Crimination, that I make Circumcision to the Jewes, a Seal onely of earthly and temporall priviledges. AS for your second accusation, you bring onely Mr. Marshals words which onely declare his suspicion; yet so unreasonable and groundless, as one might wonder any man should have the face to draw me into a su∣spicion of that, the contrary whereof is delivered in my Exercitation page 2. and very often in my Exercitation and Examen of his Sermon; in which I still make the Covenant made with Abraham Gen. 17. which Circumci∣sion confirmed, to be a mixt Covenant, containing both spirituall and temporal promises. And yet you expresly accuse me of the contrary; & against my plain words prove your charge, onely by Master Marshals suspition expressed in this manner; What your meaning is in this expression, I can∣not tell; it hath an untoward look, as if the meaning were, &c. which was unreasonable in him to raise such a jealousie of me for citing onely a passage in that so approved Treatise of Cameron that learned Scot, de tri∣plici foedere, th. 78. (which was also much approved at Heidelberg) by the publisher of his works according to an order in a Synod of the French Churches; as to be stiled in Cameron's Icon, accurratissimae theses; and they are now translated into English by Mr. Samuel Bolton, and printed at the end of his treatise, of the true bounds of Christian freedom with this commendation (too precious to be any longer concealed, or hid under the shell of an unknown tongue.) And yet these words were cited by me so warily page 4. of my Exercitation as that I say, and if we may be∣lieve Mr. Cameron; yet Mr. Marshall had so much ingenuity, as to say of me in that place page. 98. of his Defence, It is too grosse a thing to ima∣gine of God, and so expresly contrary to the word, that untill you own it, I will not impute it to you: which words you leave out in your allegation against me from Mr. Marshall, whether needlesly or fraudulently, I leave it to your own conscience to consider.
SECT. III. Of the third crimination, That I deny to the Jewish infants all right to the new Covenant till they become actuall belie∣vers, from whence occasion is taken to shew the insuffici∣ency of Mr. Gerees shift in expounding the words of the Directory [the promise is made to believers and their seed] And the insufficiency of Mr. Marshals proof of Connex∣ion between the seal and Covenant from God's institution, and Mr. Baylies from the nature of the termes. AS for the third accusatio, you bring not a word to prove it, yet you often charge sometimes all your adversaries, as in chap. 5. pag. 133. sometimes the principall of them (among whom I assure my self, you rec∣kon me) with it, as when you say, pag. 151. ch. 5. The ground of this reason is granted by the Principal of our adversaries, who avow their exclusion of infants from baptisme upon this ground mainely, that they believe they are excluded from the Covenant of Grace, remission of sins, the saving grace of the Spirit, till in the years of dscretion they be brought a∣ctually to believe, which thing I do expresly deny in my Exercitation pa. 24. with obhorrency from it, and Examen page 150. and page 109. I say, it were a madnesse to go about to put them out of the Covenant of Grace. You are often told in my Examen as page 29, 38, 110, 154. and many more places, that I avow exclusion of infants from baptism upon this ground mainly, that there is no Institution of it gathered by precept or Apostolical example, and therefore it is will-worship: As for a command of Circum∣cision I conceive it is a brogated, and so can be no rule now about Baptism; and the maintaining that a command of Circumcision stil binds us (as Mr. Marshall doth in his Sermon page 35, 36, 37.) is the most manifest here∣sie of any, as being condemned in the first Councel by the Apostles, Acts 15. 28. & 21. 25. Indeed to shew the weaknesse of Mr. Marshalls argu∣ment thus framed, The infants of believing parents are within the Cove∣nant of Grace, therefore they are to partake of the seale of the Covenant, which in Mr. Marshals language is all one with baptisme: I did say that I did conceive the antecedent of his Enthymeme not true, Examen Part 3.
Sect. 1. page 39. conceiving that as your practise is, so Mr. Marshall in∣tended to defend this conclusion; All the infants born of a believer by pro∣fession are to be baptized according to ordinary rule, and so I expressed my selfe in my Examen Part 3. Sect. 15. Exercit. page 1. and elsewhere, and then his antecedent must be thus, All the infants born of a believer are within the Covenant of grace, or else his argument is manifestly inconclu∣dent; if we would prove, all infants of believers are to be baptized, because some onely are in the Covenant of grace. Now I know not how to con∣ceive that Mr. Marshall meant any other, then the Covenant of saving grace (of which I have given reasons not yet answered by Mr. Marshall, in my Ex∣amen page 45. and could adde more if it were needful) and that the belie∣vers infants were in the covenant of saving grace in that God hath made that promise to them. And in this sense I denied this proposition, All the infants of a believer are within the Covenant of Grace, and disproved it so fully in my Examen part 3. Sect. 4. that Mr. Marshall renouncth that proposition in that sense page 116. of his Defence, and then betakes him∣self to this shift, to understand it of the outward covenant as he calls it, in which sense I have proved in my Apology Sect. 10. his first argument to be meer trifling, and his speeches to be full of equivocation, or ambiguity, which I have also further proved in my Postscript in answer to Mr. Blke Sect. 6. Mr. Geree being inforced to deny that proposition in that sense, and being pressed by me with the words of the Directory, [that the promise is made to believers and their seed] he shifted it off in his Vindiciae paedobap∣tismi page 13. by interpreting the words of the Directory thus, This is to be presumed by men out of charity, till they discover the contrary, that all the infants of believers have the inward graces of the Covenant, which I proved could not be the sense of the words of the Directory in my Apo∣lgy Sect. 9. especially from the term [made] which imports Gods act, not mans charitable presumption. Now what doth Mr. Geree reply hereto? In his Vindiciae Vindicarum chap. 4. page 16. he alters the words of the Directory thus, That the promise is to believers and their seed, leaving out the word [made] upon which my argument rested, and then page 18. tells me, the quaery is in what sense and in what respect children of blie∣vers are said to be in the Covenant of Grace, whereas the quaery is in what sense the Directory meant these words [the promise is made to believers and their seed] not in what sense either in Gen. 17. 7. or Rom. 9. 4. or Acts 3. 25. Children of Believers are said to be in the Covenant of grace. And whereas Mr. Geree in the same book cha. 10. page 41. complains of my words in the Epistle Dedicatory of my Apology, that the doctrine of
the Directory is disavowed by two of my most eminent Antagonists, mean∣ing himself and Mr. Marshall, I have, and am further ready to justify that speech, and if many of the Assembly have assured him in private, that they intended the expressions questioned by me in no other sense then he ex∣pounded them, I would have them know, that either they must alter the words as Mr. Geree doth, not reading them as they are printed, and as Mr. Marshall in his Defence page 116. Mr. Geree Vindic. Paedobap. page 13. reads them, or else those Assembly men must make a new Dictionary for us to understand their language by afore any man that understands com∣mon English will understand them so. And whereas he would have by this one Examination men iudge of all the rest, I am contented with it, provided that men by his superficial and shifting dealing in this judge of all the rest. But to returne, as I denyed the antecedent in Mr. Marshalls Enthy∣meme, so I denied the consequence page 36. and did more then make some vlitatio, I proved by a just dispute that the proposition is not true, All that are in the Covenant of Grace must be sealed, and though Mr. Marshall page 92. of his Defence, say somewhat to prove it from Gods will Gen. 17. 7, 9, 10, 14. yet what is said there is only of circumcision, nothing of baptisme, and the word [therefore] upon which Mr. Marshalls proof rests is in the Hebrew  which may be and is translated other∣wise, as by the Tigres Et tu by Parreus Tu autem, by Piscator Tu ve∣re, &c. and the proposition is manifestly false in Mr. Marshalls sense, yea he granted page 92, 182. that the formal reason of their being circumci∣sed was the command of God, which I truely observed and proved in my Apology in the Epistle Dedicatory and in the Apology it self page 90. over∣throws his argument from the Covenant to the seale, which rests on this, that such as received the initial seal, received it because they were in the Covenant, which are Mr. Marshalls words in his Defence page 92. you in your Anabaptisme chap. 5. page 132. say, your proposition is grounded on the nature of the terms, which you never go about to prove but dictate thus: The Major, [Whoever have right to the chief promises of the New Testament, they have right to the first Sacrament of the New Testament, if the Lord have not put some impediment to their participa∣tion of that Sacrament] is grounded on the nature of the terms of the pre∣position the chief promises of the New Testament, and the first Sacra∣ment, this is the sign and seal, that the thing signified. The reason proceeds not from every thing signified to every sign but from the chief thing signi∣fied to the first signe. Give me leave to tell you that I seldome meet with a passage that
hath more absurdity then this of yours. 1. You set not down right the terms of your own proposition, which are not [the chief promises of the New Te∣stament, and the First Sacrament] but [having right to the chief promi∣ses of the New Testament, and having right to the First Sacrament, if the Lord have not put some impediment to their participation of that Sa∣crament] as if you had forgotten so soon or could not analyse your own proposition. 2. You tell us [this is the sign and seale, that the thing signi∣fied] as if this were the nature of the terms. But what an illogical con∣ceit is this? Logicians call a reason from the nature of the terms, when the terms are included, the one in Conceptu quidditativo alterius, so as that the one cannot be conceived without the other. Now may not the chief promises of the New Testament be conceived without the first sign and seale? Did not God make the chief promises of the New and Old Testa∣ment before ever any sign or seale was appointed, much more before bap∣tisme? Did not God make the chief promise  Tit. 1. 2. which we translate before the world began, most rigtly as I conceive Dr. wisse Vind. grat. lib. 1. par. 1. dig. 2. cap. 5. referres to that in para∣dise Gen 3. 15. your own Mr. Dicksor, either to that or to Gods promise to Christ afore the world was made, all I meet with make it antecede any first signe or seal of the Old or New Testament? Now how is there a conne∣xion between terms from the nature of them, whereof one may not only be conceived, but be also existent both de facto and diure without the other? If the terms were [having the chief promises of the New Testament, and having the First Sacrament] yet there is no such connexion from the na∣ture of the terms. Innumerable may have, and have the chief promises of the New Testament, that have not the first Sacrament, et vice versa. Else you must hold worse positions then the Papists that none but baptized per∣sons have or can have the chief promises of the New Testament, and that every baptized person hath the chief promises of the New Testament. There is lesse connexion from the nature of the terms between the having right to the chief promises of the New Testament, & having right to the First Sacra∣ment of the New Testament. For if you meane it of right before God, thousands may have right in Gods election and covenant with Christ, that are not in being, that are in their mothers womb, that are yet among in∣fidels uncalled: have these right to the First Sacrament? If you mean it of right in facie Ecclesiae onely, then I grant the proposition is true: but your Minor hath clean another sense then your words and proofs import you conceived of it: however this right comes meerly from Gods institution, which is to be the rule of the Churches judging and administrators action,
and that is not from the right to the chief promises, but from profession of faith arising from Gods will not the nature of the terms. There is no es∣sential connexion between them constitutive or consecutive, neither is one of the definition or essential property to the other: and God hath much more plainly put a barre against infant-baptisme then infant-communion, not only in that there is neither expresse precept nor example for it in Scri∣pture, but also the very intitution excludes them, appointing it only to dis∣ciples Mat. 28. 19. putting believing before baptisme Mark 16. 16. & in practise requiring it Act. 8. 37. besides the image of it in all ages of the Church requiring profession of faith of some for them even in the baptisme of infants. But you shew the nature of the terms in these words, This is the sign and seal, that the thing signified. By your Logick then if the chief promises of the New Testament be to be defined you would define them to be the thing signified by the first Sacrament of the New Testament: which were to define ignotum per ignotius, and by that which is meerly extrinsecal to it. A promise is an action: the thing signified by the first Sacrament is not only something to come but also something past as the death, burial, resurrection of Christ in baptisme Rom. 6. 3, 4. Col. 2. 12. the thing promised is something we are to have, the promise is Gods act, the first Sacrament the administrators act. How inept a definition is such a definition in which the genus doth not praedici in quid on the defini∣tum, or the whole definition is reciprocal with the definitum, besides o∣ther defects? But it maybe you meant that it is of the nature of the first Sacrament to be a sign and sale of the chief promises of the New Testa∣ment. Were this so, you should not rightly argue: for then the right to the promises should be derived from the seal, not to the seale from the pro∣mise, if the promise be of the nature of the seale, and not econtra: wheras you say that your reason proceeds from the chief thing signifyed to the first sign. But how can you or any make this good that it is the nature of the first Sacrament only (for you exclude the second expressely after in these words, nor do we  but of the ) to be a signe and seale of the chief promises of the New Testament? Is not the second sign as wel a sign and seal of them as the first? Besides what is the term [seale] there but a Metaphor? And is it not absurd to make a Metaphr of the nature of a term, which doeth not shew what a thing is but what it is like, con∣trary to the rule of Logicians? Scheibler. op. a. 30. num. 126. Defi∣nitio non sit ex verbis Metaphoricis. Ita Aristot. Top. Lib. 2. cap. 2. Sect 4 K ker Syst. Logi. Lib. 1. Sect. 2. cap. 2. &c. Yet how absurdly is a seale of the Covenant made the Genus in the definition of a
sacrament being but a Metaphor, and books and Sermons stuffed with collections of duties and priviledges about the Sacraments from a meer Metaphor? A thing I am assured worthy Lamentation when I consider the trouble it hath brought to many consciences, and disquiet in the Church. But were it granted that the term, signe or seal were of the nature of the first Sacrament, how doth it appear that it is the nature of the Sacrament to signifie Gods promise to us rather then our promise to God? Though I de∣ny not but baptisme signifies and in a sense seales Gods promises to us, as may be seen in my former writings, yet so farre as I am able to discern the chief and primary use is to signifie our profession and promise to God, and therefore it is required as our act and duty, and therein we are said to put on Christ. And why then should we not rather say, that it is the nature of baptisme to be a sign or seale of our profession, and then we have a bet∣ter argument from the nature as you speak, from the use, as I would speak, of the first Sacrament to prove that infants are not to be baptized, then that they are. The trueth is Sacraments are not signes natural but positive, and so have no nature to sign or seale but by institution, and therefore there's no connexion, or right between the Covenant and seal, as they speak, from the nature of the tenns, but by Gods institution. And therefore Mr. Mar∣shall did more considerately ascribe it to Gods will, then you do to  it from the nature of the terms, you miscarry as much in that which followes when you say, The reason proceeds not from every thing signified to every sign, but from the chief thing signified to the first sign: yet before you expressed the nature of the terms thus, The one is the sign, the other the thing signified, and you give no reason why there should be more connex∣ion between the chief things signified, and the first sign, then the not chief things signified, and the second, nor do I know by what rule you proceed in making some promises of the New Testament chief, and some not: It follows, Some of the blessings which Circumcision diaseal belonged to Melchizedeck, to Lo to Job, and others who were not so farre as we reade circumcised, but the main promise sealed by Circumcision, In thy seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed, The Messias comming of the posterity of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, the Covenant of Grace as it was administred under the figure of the Ceremoniall Law did belong to the people of Israel alone, nd to the proselytes who joined themselves to their body. You intimate truly that the reason of circumcising infants was not taken from the common right of believers to the Covenant of Grace, but from the end God had in signifying Christ to come of Abraham, which is a good evidence that baptizing infants now hath not the same reason that
circumcising of infants had then, and so all your argument from the a∣nalogy between Ifant-Baptisme and Infant-Circumcision from the like reason of both falls to the gound: But sure the main promise of the New Testament did belong to , Lot and Job as much as to be∣lievers now, and if righteousnesse by faith be sealed by circumcision, as you expressely teach page 141. from Rom. 4. 11. then the main promise sealed by Circumcision belonged to Melchizeck, Lot and Job, and so if there be such a connexion between the chief promise and the first seale they should have been circumcised as well as the Jewes: and it is as strange to me how you can make the promise of the Messias comming from Abra∣ham belonging to proselytes more then to them. But this is enough to give a taste of your manner of disputing. But I must follow you, you go on. SECT. IV. Of the fourth Crimination, that I give a power to unbaptized persons to baptize others. IN giving a power to unbaptized persons to baptize others. For proof of this you referre the Reader to the letters BB page 111. and there I find one passage of Mr. Marshall, which only declares his own conceit, and one passage of mine from my Apology page 54. which speaks not at all of that point, but of another, whether in any case an unbaptized person may receive the Lords Supper. As for that you charge me with, I remem∣ber not where I have spoken to it in my printed writings. But for the thing it self. If no continuance of adult-baptisme can be proved, and bap∣tisme by such baptized persons is wanting, yet I conceive, what may Protestant writers do yield, when they are pressed by the Papists to shew the calling of the first reformers, That after an universal corruption the ne∣cessity of the thing doth justify the persons that reforme though wanting an ordinary,Vide Ans. of the Elders of New Ergl ro 32 que. q 21. p 72, 13, 74. all in defe of answ. 109  sit. page 156. regular calling (which thing I find fully avouched by the Ministers sent to Oxford in their Account given to he Parliament page 28, 29.) will justify in such a case both the lawfulnesse of a Ministers baptizing, that hath not been rightly baptized himself, and the sufficiency of that baptisme to the person so baptized. And this very thing,
that in a case where a baptized Minister cannot be had, it is lawfull for an unbaptized person to baptize, and his baptisme is valid, is both the resolution of Aquinas parte 3. q. 67. art. 5. and Lanchius an eminent Protestant Comment. in Ephes. 5. 26. Loc. 2. part. 2. cap. 4. num. 21. quaeritu an is possit baptizare eos quos ad Christum convert, cum ipse nunquam fuerit baptizatus baptismo aquae? non dubito quin possit, & vicissim curare, ut ipse ab alio ex illis a se conversis baptizetur. Ratio est: quia minister est verb:, à Christo extra ordinem excitatus: eo{que} ut talis minister, potest cum illius Ecclesolae consens, symmstam constituere, & ab eo ut baptizerer curare. Whereby you may perceive that this is no new truth, that an unbaptized person ay in some case baptize another, and he baptize him being baptized of him. And if you hold it so hai∣nous a positier, you might do well to answer Mr. Spilry his reasons in his book intituled the Sant interest, chiefly page 10. which book you cite in the third and fourth chapters of your ANABAPTISME, though in your third chapter you mistake, in alleadging words as Mr. Spilsberie's, which are in the preface to the book made by Mr. Cox. SECT. V. Of the fifth Crimination, that I make Apologies for the worst of the Anabaptists. IN making Apologies for the worst of the Anabaptists even those of Munster. And in the margin and the table in the end of your book, you say of me, He is a friend to the worst Anabaptists, and injurious to all who oppose them. And for proofe of this you referre the reader to the let∣ters CC, where is one passage cited out of my Apology page 31. which hath not a word of Apology or friendship for, or towards any of the evil practises of the Anabaptists; but you might have read in the next page before, a professed abhorring of their wicked practises, and judging them worse in them, then they would be in others not so baptized. As for the words you alledge, they contain onely a declaration of my suspension of my judgement concerning some things related of them for reasons there al∣ledged. In which suspension I am the more confirmed by your palpably righteous, if not malicious dealing with me in these accusations. And
I conceive your, Mr. Marshal's, and other Paedobaptists dealing in mis-re∣porting of me and others will better serve for their Apology, then my words. 'Tis true, I endeavour to remove that prejudice against the truth of Anti∣paedobaptisme, which your, and other mens bitter writings and preachings create to it in your charging the miscarriages of Muncer, and at Munster and some others upon the doctrine it self, never considering that now for a long time no such miscarriages are charged upon them justly, they live as peaceably as other men, their doctrine disclaimes them, the like miscarri∣ages have been in removing other evils that are confessed to be such, as in the Iconoclasts, Antiprelatists, &c. which you would think it to be un∣righteous to charge on those that have sought the removing of Images, pre∣lacy and ceremonies. Why then do you deale so unjustly with others, for∣getting that golden rule of Christ Mat. 7. 12. Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do you even so to them: for this is the Law and the Prophets? Whereto let me adde that reading lately in Grimstones General History of the Netherlands lib. 9. pag. 442. that the inquistion of Spain advised the King of Spain in these words art. 7. They shall hire at our charge thieves and spoylers of Churches and images, whose offences shall be by all the world imputed to the rebells, by some subtil meanes, and so we shall vanquish them. I conceived my speech in my Apology page 31. (which you interpret as very hainous) considerately, when I said, I do count the story of the Anabaptists to contain in it many things, the true reasons of which, and the true knowledge of the circumstances concerning them will not appear till the day of the revelation of the righteous iudgement of God. And I confesse it makes me somewhat suspicious that in these daies by Jesuiticall Emissaries horrid opinions, and unruly practises are vented; and attempted to make the party that are for reformation, and truth at this day odious to the world. SECT. VI. Of the sixth Crimination inveighing against the first reformers. ANd invectives against the best that oppose them; the first reformers. For proof hereof you referre the Reader to the letters DD page 111.
where is alledged one passage of my Apology in page 32. which hath not a word of invectivenesse against the first reformers, much lesse any inve∣ctive against the best that opposed the Anabaptists at Munster, but only in as mild an expression as I could desire, a declaration of my opinion, that the reformed Churches have beene to blame that they never yielded to re∣forme Paedobaptisme in a regular way. Will not you say the Saxon Churches have been to blame in not taking away of Images out of Churches, the English Churches in not removing Prelacy and ceremonies? yet you would think he wronged you, that should say, that in that speech you made an invective against those Churches. Yet this is your dealing with me. SECT. VII. Of the seventh Crimination inveighing against the Assembly at Westminster. THe Assembly at Westminister. For proof hereof you referre the Rea∣der to the letters E E page 111. where is cited one passage out of my Apology page 106. which hath not a word of exception against any man, much lesse of invectivenesse against the Assembly at Westminster: only it contains the expression of my belief that the ablest of the Assembly con∣trived Mr. Marshalls book, and my wish, that it were declared whether the Paedobaptists would stick to it or any other work: which I conceive a reasonable wish, finding the Proteus-like inconstancy of Paedobaptists in many points of the dispute between us, particularly in the chief argu∣ment from circumcision and the covenant Gen. 17. to infant-baptism, one forming the argument one way, another another way, one deriving the connexion between the Covenant and initial seal from the nature of the terms, another from Gods will, one ascribing an interest in the outward Covenant only to all infants of believers, another ascribing an interest to them in the inward Covenant also according to charitable presumption, a∣nother conditionally, another asserting the Covenant of Grace to belong to them for the most part, one grounding infant-baptisme on the judgement of charity, another denying that sufficient: and requiring a judgement of faith, one stating the question concerning all infants of believers, another
concerning some only, one interpreting 1 Cor. 7. 14. of federal holinesse, another of real holinesse, one waving the argument from succession of bap∣tisme to circumcision, another avouching it, with many other differences, which tend to the wearying of a disputant and the eudg of a Reader that desires to find truth, and to spend time in examining what is fixed, not to lose it in disputing against that which one will own, but it my be most will disclaim. What the Assembly have done in this matter doth not yet answer this wish. What is said in the Direstory, it may be well doubted whether Assembly-men now hold, by that which hath paed between me and Mr. Marshal and Mr. Geree, about the proposition, [the promise is made to believers and their seed,] what is said in their dvice concerning a confession of faith Ch. 28. Art. 4. is so farre from satisfying, that it is yet a riddle to me how infant-baptisme can be drawn from Ge. 17. 7, 9. with Gal. 3. 9, 14. which I remember not alledged by any Paedobaptists since I entered on the dispute, save what I heard from Mr. Herl now the Proloutor; (which I mention in my Apology page 41.) which he did with so little e∣vidence for his purpose, as I supposed it had been his own peculiar conceit, not the Assemblies argument. And for the rest of the texts, if the Assem∣bly can say any more the Mr. Marshll and others have said for deducing of Paedobaptisme out of them, it were fit it should be known, if not, I for my part count my self as much unsatisfyed by the Assemblies alledging impertinent texts, as by a private mars doing the same. This I declare to give the reason of that speech of mine in my Apology. As for the As∣sembly though I have expressed my jealousie of some defects in them, and perhaps shall not agree with them in all their determinations, yet I have cast no filth in their faces, as Mr.  injuriously accused me, even for my good will to them; but have  and spoken respectively of them, as Exmen page 1. studying what I could to prevent those blemishes in their proceedings and determinations, which will in time more appear then yet they do, and am induced to believe that there are so many of them therein that know me so well, as that they would be loath to disclaim me, what∣ever they do of my opinion. And though Mr.  in his Suspension Suspende page 21. saith, Mr.  is approved by the Assmbly, and so takes his book to be approved by them; and you count my words of that book to be an invective against the Assely: yet I do not take it to be approved by the Assmly till they declare it to be so, though I have reason to conceive, that divers of the ablest of the Assembly, especially in some part of learning, had their hand in it.
SECT. VIII. Of the eighth Crimination inveighing against the Church of Scotland. THe Church of Scotland. For proofe of this you refene the Reader to the letters F F page 112. in which you cite one passage of my Apolo∣gy page 93. which doth not so much as mention any Church, much lesse the Church of Scotland, but onely the mannagers of the censure of juridi∣cal excommunication, whom however the Papst: & Prelates use to speak, I think you use not to call the Church of Scotland, nor do I. Nor is there a word of invectivenesse aginst any in those wordes, but only a declaration, what I question upon my best intelligence which had lesse reference to Scot∣land, then to other parts of the world. SECT. IX. Of the nineth Crimination, inveighing against Mr. Marshal. MAster MARSHAL. For proofe hereof you referre your Reader to the letters G G page 112. and there you cite two passages out of my APOLOGY: one of which page 57. is this. I find the words of an intelligent man true concerning Mr. Marshal, that he was apt to mistake, and in the other page 69. I say, that I find him still a confused disputer: which indeed containes some complaint of Mr. Marshal, much lesse then I had cause: but not any invective, which I take to be an oration against a man to make him odious, such as Tllies Philippicks against Antonius, and Demosthenes against Philip, and Naziazen against Julian.
SECT. X. Of the tenth Crimination, of inveighing against Mr. Tho. Goodwin. MAster Goodwin. For proofe hereof you referre the Reader to the let∣ters H H page 112. And there you cite two shreds of a large pas∣sage concerning an accusation of Mr. Marshal, in which he chargeth me as vilifying Mr. Thomas Goodwin, which charge I there answer, and then use some words which are not invective, but a declaration, what I con∣ceived of his discourse, which if it may not be allowed in dispute the best writers among us will be condemned Dr. Twisse, Mr. Gataker, and your brethren Mr. Rutherfurd, Mr. Gillespy, your self, and who not? your own words in the first part of your Dissuasive page 119. do come neerer to an invective against Mr. Thomas Goodwin, then any words in my Apology or Examen; the former of which the licenser although Mr. Goodwins tender friend, yet judged mil. SECT. XI. Of the eleventh Crimination, of invectives against others. ANd others. For proof of this you referre the Reader to H H 2. page 112. where you cite two passages of my Apology, the one con∣taining no accusation, no nor so much as a complaint against any one, but onely a mention of my experiment, which I wish the case of Doctor Twisse (that I instance in no other) had not verified; the other passage is no invective against any but meerly an applying of Mr. Ley's words to my Treatise, which he had avowed of my Antagonists writings. Sir, I suppose it would better have suited with charity, I living the last summer at the Temple not farre from you, if you had in a brotherly way minded me of my flying hgh, of my inivility, or inisretion, that I might have seene your love in your reproof, afore I saw your accusation to my disgrace in print.
But you add more accusations of me, and say. But in those thing he goes farre beyond all the Anabaptists I have met with. SECT. XII. Of the twelfth Crimination, that I esteem baptisme an unnecessa∣ry rite. FIrst he esteems baptism so unnecessary a rite that men who are meet to receive it may very well be without it, as Constantine, Ambrose and o∣thers did delay to their old age that Sacrament. And in the margine, and ta∣ble at the end of your book. He makes baptisme a rite needlesse either to young or old, and for proof whereof you referre the Reader to the letters II page 112. and those letters referre to B B suprà, where two passages are cited, one of Mr. Marshals, which onely declares his own conceit a∣bout another point, that supposing infant-baptisme a nullity he cannot un∣derstand how any in the world should this day be lawfully baptized, and another passage out of my Apology page 54. which is cited by you maimed∣ly as Psalm 91. 11. was cited Math. 4. 6. leaving out five lines that come between [perplexities] and [for besides] without any &c. perverting there∣by the sense, as if the words [for besides, &c.] were a reason of that you cite before, whereas they are a reason of that which I expresse; but you leave out, that I do not think an unbaptized person receiving the Lords Supper is either such a new opinion or practise, as Mr. Marshall made it. And yet in the words as you cite them, there is no proof of that you charge me with. There is no mention at all of Ambrose, and that which I men∣tion of Constantine is done without any approbation. Nor will it follow from my determination, that because I say, if it be stood upon in point of conscience, so as in no case an unbaptized person is to be permitted to partake of the Lords Supper, it will of necessity make many superstitious perplexities in Ministers, and inferre many an unnecessary schisme; therefore I esteem baptisme a needlesse rite, that men who are meet to receive it may very well be without it. This argument (and such I take your proof to be) I would say, if I may use that Schoole expression any more, is a baculo ad angulum. And yet a man would think you had need of a strong proof to make men believe that I hold baptisme a needlesse rite, who have suffered
and still suffer very much for my opposing infant-baptisme. But my words truly understood do inferre the contrary to that you charge me with, sith they assert baptisme afore the Lords supper necessary to be stood upon in point of prudence for right order, and intimate the like in point of consci∣ence except in some cases. When I consider this dealing with me I cannot guesse why you should thus abuse me in this so credible a thing, unlesse you would slily insinuate as if I were of the Socainians mind in this, and thereby help to loade me with the most unbrotherly charge of Socinianizing begun by Mr. Marshal in the beginning of his Defence, for which the Lord forgive him and you. SECT. XIII. Of the thirteenth Crimination, that I am carelesse of my own baptisme. ANd it seems himself is carelesse to be baptized to this day. For his infant-baptisme according to his arguments must be null, & another baptism as yet it seems he hath not received. Here you accuse me of careles∣ness of my own baptism. But, Sir, let me tell you, that unlesse you knew it by my own confession (which I am sure you did not) you go beyond your line to judge my secret practises, yea my very thoughts, for carelessenes is a priva∣tion of cares which are thoughts. You say, I am a very bold man, but you no where find in me such boldnesse as this to judge a mans thoughts. You might do well to remember what is said Mat. 7. 1. James 3. 1. But for the thing you say, my infant-baptisme according to my arguments must be null, and as yet it seems I have not received another baptisme. Let it be granted that my infant-baptisme according to my arguments must be null, that is as I understand insufficient for the doing of the duty of be∣ing baptized according to Christs appointment (which yet you have not so much as attempted to prove) and that I have not yet received another bap∣tism, how doth this prove my carelessenesse of mine own baptisme? For if it were true indeed that according to my arguments my infant-baptisme were null, yet if it did not so appear to me (as I confesse I was once doubt∣ful, as my words Exercit. pag. 22. shew, conceiving the maine use of baptisme being a confirming of my profession of Christ, by that right an after profession might ratify a former baptisme though not every way right, though I dare not rest upon that conceit) and therefore I did not receive an∣other
baptisme, that would prove I was not altogether carelesse of my own baptisme. But what? if I did conceive my infant-baptisme a nulli∣ty, and yet doubted whether any could now be rightly baptized, because no unbaptized person can give baptism, as Mr. Marshall professeth in his Defence page 245. or because none can now give the spirit, and therefore received not baptisme yet, this might free me from your charge of careles∣nesse of my own baptisme. Again if I were resolved that right baptism might be had notwithstanding these doubts, and were resolved to receive it, but either waited to see what the Assembly would do about examining the point of Paedobaptisme, or the Churches of New England, or how I might do my duty to Christ with least offence to the State, or to my brethren in the Ministery, and with most satisfaction to my own conscience concerning the administrator, administration and other circumstances about it, I might be rather over-careful then carelesse of my own baptism for ought you knew to the contrary, and consequently your accusation of me might be (as it was) both rash and false. Will you say the Ministers about London, that have differred adminstring the Lords Supper for many years for want of settled discipline are carelesse of the Lords Supper? and yet were not you partial I were more excusable in my action about this thing. But I hope your accusation of me shall do me so much good, as to quicken me to a more spedy resolution what to do in this great businesse, though I confesse my over-tendernesse to give offence to my brethren in the Ministery who have shewed little or no tender regard of me, but rather have set themselves to make me odious, to keep me under in my credit and estate, and (which is excessive impiety) to hinder me in the work of my Ministery of the Go∣spel, hath made me somewhat the slacker in resolving and accomplishing what is my duty in this thing. SECT. XIV. Of the fourteenth Crimination, That I am unwilling to join with any of the Anabaptists Churches, and they unwil∣ling to baptize non-members. FOr he professeth an unwillingnesse to oine himself as a member to any of the Anobaptists Churches, and I suppose they are unwilling to bap∣tize
any, who will not joine in Communion with them. And for proof of the former you referre the Reader to the letters K K page 112. at which you cite (not as they are in my book) some words of my Apology page 10. which neither as they are in mine, or your book do prove my unwillingnesse to joine my self as a member to any of the Anabaptists Churches. For a man may be willing to joine himself as a Member to any of the Anabap∣tists Churches, and yet not dare to gaher a separated Church, not every one who joins as a member with a separated Church being guilty of a schisme, which a gatherer of a separated Church may be guilty of. Besides a man may not know how to justify at one time the practise of gathering a separa∣ted Church or joining with it, who may know how to justify it at another time, when there is no hope of reformation, and men are judged hereticks, and excommunicated for holding truth and doing their duty. The seven dissenting brethren in the Assembly had subscribed with fourteen more of the ablest of the Assembly to certain considerations to disswade from fur∣ther gathering of Churches in that present juncture of time, to which my words you cite had reference, who it may be now would not disswade from gathering Churches. But the truth is my not daring to gather a sepa∣rated Church then was my willingnesse to join with any Churches of Christ (and I think as much ill will as you bear to them, yet you will not dare to say, that none of the Anabaptists Churches are Churches of Christ) though I was not willing to be a separating member in any Church but willing to be a conjoined member with all the Churches of Christ in gene∣ral, and each in particular: So farre is your allegation from proving what you charge me with that it proves the contrary. And for that you say, that you suppose the Anabaptists Churches are unwilling to baptize any who will not joine in communion with them, if you meane thus, they will not baptize any who will not joine in Communion with them as fixed members entring into the Covenant called Church-Covenant, and professing the way of discipline called the Congregational way as the only way, and separaring from any Church of Christ that is in any other way of discipline (for not doing which it seems you conceive them unwilling to admit me to baptisme) I have cause to think you are mistaken. For having upon occasion of these your words written to an Elder of one of their Churches intreating him to consult with some others, and to give me resolution in these questions. 1. What joining in Communion do you require without which you will not bptize any? 2. Whether on my profession of my repentance and aith in the Lord Je∣sue,
and readinesse to hold communion with all the Churches of Christ in the things of Christ, though I do not promise to be a fixed member in any of their Congregations, you would admit me to baptisme? I received this following answer subscribed by three graduates in schooles, godly and learned men in these words: That which we require and without which we will not baptize any is a persons manifestation of himselfe to be a believer in Jesus Christ, and to desire baptisme according to the revealed will of Christ, and in obedi∣ence thereunto, we do not baptize any into this or that particular congre∣gation: but only into that one body in general spoken of 1 Cor. 12. 13. As touching joining in communion, we in this case require no more, then a manifest readinesse to hold communion with all the Churches of Christ in the things of Christ, and accordingly to shew a real willingnesse to have communion with any particular Church of Christ according as the hand of God shall give opportunity, and true seasonablenesse of and for the same. Thus we judge and practise accordingly. Benjamen Cox. Henry Jesse. Hanserd Knollys. I do testifie the substance hereof to be the professed judgement of that congregation whereto I am joined, and also that congregation, where Mr. Kiffin, Patient, and Spilsbery are joined, who did affirm so much to be their own judgement also. The Scripture upon which we so practise is that Acts 8. 37, 38. Hanserd Knollys. SECT. XV. Of the fifteenth Crimination, of my allowing frequent rebap∣tization. SEcondly when a man is baptized according to his own minde, he al∣lowes him to be oft thereafter rebaptized, even so oft as he repents for sin, which by the godly is done (as the least ought to be done) oftener then once. And in the margin and the table at the end of your book, He al∣lowes a frequent rebaptizing: and for proof you referre your Reader to the letters L L page 112. and there you send your Reader back to the letter C supr. Now after you had said: but to put the equity of this reproof out of doubt, their great Patrons now are come to defend the lawfulnesse
of baptisme not onely twice, but if ye will ten times; yea so oft as you re∣pent for sin, which ought to be oftner, then once a day. So of Anabap∣tists they become Hemerobaptists, and more, for proof of this you refer the Reader to the letter C, and there you alledge one passage in my Exa∣men page 23. and another passage in my Apology page 53. and a relati∣on of unnamed Eminent Divines. It is true, that to shew the unreasonable dealing of those that made re∣baptization an heresie, I did intreate one good argument to prove it un∣lawful in se for a man that hath been baptized rightly to be baptized a∣gaine, and to shew the weaknesse of the arguments brought to prove it unlawful in se to rebaptize, I breiefly answered the two chief, the latter wherof seems to be that upon which the Assembly rested, in that they alledge, to prove this proposition, The Sacrament of baptisme is but once to be ad∣ministred to any person, onely the text Tit. 3. 5. where God is said to save us by the washing of regeneration. Advice for confession of faith, chap. 28, art. 7. And then I added, that if there were as good example for Paedobaptisme, as that of Acts 19. 5, 6. for rebaptizing, the contro∣versie concerning Paedobaptisme were at an end with me. In which pas∣sage I did not assert the proof to be good for rebaptizing; but compared with the proof for Paedobaptisme to be better, that is more probable then the other, and such as if I had had but the like for Paedobaptisme I had not moved any more about it. Which I wrote, because I knew that very many writers both antient and latter do very probably from expresse words in that place conceive, that Paul did rebaptize, whereas there is not any probability, that any infat was baptized by the Apostles; nor have the Antients (that I know) ever gone about to prove it from any example in the Acts of the Apostles but by tradition. But in all this I did not at all set down my judgement of the thing, whether rebaptizing were lawful or not, but onely questioned the proofes alledged to make it unlawful, whe∣ther they yielded good arguments. I know there was another argument from circumcision but once: but I did not think that argument worth an∣swering, nor do I yet, notwithstanding Mr. Marhals esteem of it, nor it may seeme would the Assembly build on it by their omitting it in the place before quoted. I still professe, that I reject all arguments drawn since the Apostles from analogy of rites or customes of the Jewes in meer positive things so as to conclude thence any thing to bind us as uredivino by Gods appoinntment. And I conceive they serve for no better purpose, then to cause much wrangling, to fill people with superstitions, and to weary schollers, and that they better fit Papists and Prelates turns, then
Independents or Presbyterians. And I was sorry to reade in your brother Gil∣lespy his Aarons rod blossoming book 1 cha. 3. page 15. that from 2 Chr. 19. 8, 10, 11. the reverend and learned Assembly of Divines have drawn an argument for ruling Elders, hoping they would have discarded all such ar∣guments. But I said also Examen page 84. I conceive it true, that there is no necessity of administring either circumcision or baptism above once: but a demonstrative argument to prove it an heresie or unlawfull in it self to rebaptize I yet expect. These passages Mr. Marshall page 67. of his Defence sayes, do clearly discover my itch after new opinions. But this was inconside∣rately & uncharitably said, sith my words lead him  another reason of those passages, though it were but intimated, which is the misery and mischief which comes by mens magisterial determinations of heresies and errors, and binding mens consciences with a pretended jure divino upon topical rea∣sons, it being the cause of many schismes, and much hatred between Christians, and is the true cause of  confusions and warres be∣tweene Christians, that arise upon difference of opinion in matters of religion. I said indeed, that Mr. Marshals reasons were not convincing to me, nor is the holding of rebaptization such a new opinion as he would make it. But how do any passages of my Examen page 23. or my Apology page 53. prove that which you charge me with, that when a man is bap∣tized according to my own mind I allow him to be oft thereafter rebap∣tized, even so oft as he repents for sin, which by the odly is done, at least ought to be done every day oftner then once, that I allow of a frequent rebapization, that to put the equity of the reproach of rebaptizing out of doubt, I (whom you dubbe the Anabaptists great Patron, though indeed a Patron of nothing, but truth, and right) am now come to defend the law∣fulnesse of baptisme not onely twice, but if ye will ten times, yea so oft as you repent for sin, which ought to be oftner then once a day, so of Ana∣baptists they become Hemrobaptists and more. But you have a tale of some eminent Divines to help you out, that in my sermon before the House of Commons (for to whom else [his] can re∣fene I see not, there being no other but Mr. Marshal and my selfe men∣tioned in that paragraph) I did avow in terminis, that it is no fault to bap∣tize ten times. Now sure those Eminent Divines, and your self by hearkening to them, and reporting this in print without ever speaking or writing to me about it, though I lived not farre from you or them, do shew that to be true, which is every where complained of, that rigid Presby∣terians are very apt to receive false reports, and to publish them of any that dissent from them, that they rake into every dunghil to find some
filth to throw into the faces of their brethren, and therefore godly per∣sons are very unwilling to come under their yoke. But that you may know the plain truth, I never yet preached a sermon before the House of Commons, nor in such sermon did avow in terminis, that it is no fault to baptize ten times. I have enquired about this tale, and it is conjectured by some, that this tale was hatched out of a passage of a Sermon of Mr. Waler Cradock before the House of Commons July 21. 1646. on 1 John 1. 3, 4. page 28. which was this, When I have communion with a Saint I must not looke whether he be of such an opinior, or whether he have taken the Covenant, or have been baptized nce or twice or ten times, but see if he have fel∣lowship with the Father, and with Jesus Christ, which it's likely was misreported; and made him in the margine put these words: I speak not this as if my opinion were for rebaptization, &c. This forwardnesse to misreport things done now, as it discovers much ill affection in mens spirits, and that the Presbyterian spirit, when persons grow factious, will run into undue courses as well as the Anabaptistick spirit; so it gives much cause to considerate men to doubt whether many things reported of the Anabap∣tists heretofore, and all taken up in your dragge-net whether true or false (which are the best pillar you have to uphold the great corruption of Paedo∣baptism or Paedorantism as now it deserves to be stiled) were true as they were reported. SECT. XVI. Of the sixteenth Crimination, That I make it lawful for per∣sons unbaptized to partake of the Lords Supper. AS for that you charge me with when you say, Thirdly he makes it lawfull for persons before they be baptized to partake of the Lords Supper, and referre your Reader to MM and thence to BB and chapter 3. pag. 53. when you say, And some of their greatest Doctors hold it in no wise incongruous to admit persons to the Lords Table before they be bap∣tized, and for this you cite my words page 54. of my Apology, had you dealt candidly with me, you should have set down my opinion as I propound it, which was that in some case it might be permitted. But neither you nor Mr. Marshall have dealt fairely with me in this matter. You set not down my opinion rightly, but leave out the limitation which did right∣ly
state my opinion, and Mr. Marshall pag. 167. of his Defence misreports me, That I confesse I find no example of an unbaptized person receiving the Lords Supper, and neither youn or Mr. Marshall do take upon you to answer my reasons, which are either in my Examen pag. 85. or in my Apo∣logy pag. 53, 54. but onely censure me for freaks and outleaps, and a spice of itch after new opinions for propounding my opinion with reasons a∣bout a case of conscience, which troubles many, and is of very frequent occurrence, in a place that lead me to speak of it. But it seems neither Mr. Marshall nor your self are willing to let any thing passe, that may make me odious, or ridiculous, though you do but shew your own inconsiderate∣nesse, and uncharitablenesse, the like dealing you use towards me in the following charges. SECT. XVII. Of the seventeenth Crimination, That I am a compleate E∣rastian, wherein reason is given of my doubt, that in Scri∣pture no such juridicall Excommunication is appointed as is now contended for. YOu say, Fourthly, to shew how little inclineable he is to joine with the Anabaptists, he declares himself a compleat ERASTIAN. Sir, what I said, and to what end, I expressed plainly enough in my Apo∣logy page 91. The occasion of printing what I conceived, was a passage in Mr. Marshalls Defence, which he stuffed with all the exceptions he could thrust in against my person, but answered little or nothing punctually in the maine points of the dispute, (which praevarication, I may perhaps in time discover also, in your dispute (chap. 5.) of your ANABAPTISME) The occasion of speaking in private conference, was, to shew my sensible∣nesse of the misery of the Land, by reason of the present differences, upon some speech that was moved by some friend of mine, (as I remember,) when the Assembly brought into the House of Commons, their Petitior, desiring power to suspend persons from the Lords Supper for all scandals, without restriction; and asserted the Presbyterian Government, (unto which they advised the Parliament,) to be jure Divino, by the will and appointment of Jesus Christ. What I spake then, and since printed;
was to shew my compassion of my native Countrey like to be ruined, by the violent asserting things disputable, to be ure Divino; and thereby neces∣sitating men to oppose, lest conscience be brought in bondage, according to the Apostles warning Col. 2. 20. It was not (as you say) to shew how little inclineable I am to oine with the Anabaptists. Nor did I declare my selfe a Compleat ERASTIAN in the words you alleadge at the letters NN out of my Apology, as you charge me; but only expresse my doubts; much lesse did I declare my self a compleate ERASTIAN, that is in your sense one that holds with ERASTUS in all things, where∣in he differs from BEZA in the disputes between them. For whereas there are two main points in difference between them, Excommunication, and the mixt Presbytery; Concerning this latter, my words in my Apology speak nothing against it, but rather for it, when I say, And if any Assembly of Ministers and Rulers be set up, for the better discovery of such as live vi∣ciously, or do contrary to the Christian faith, or worship, that a person be not charged with those evils upon uncertain reports, I think it agree∣able to Gods will 1 Tim. 5. 19. And whereas Mr Gillespy in his Aarons rod blossoming, page 249. hath these words, Erasus pag. 175. hath not spared to say, that the Magistrate may in the New Testament (though he might not in the Old,) exercise the Ministeriall functior, of he can have so much leasure from his other imployments, and pag. 315. in very truth the Erastians▪ do oppose not only the institution, but the Lawfulnesse and agreeablenesse to the word of God of a Church-government distinct from the civill; yet you cannot shew that I hold either of these positions. I confesse I have read ERASTUS his Theses & Confirmatio thesium; but I could not do it so exactly, as I would have done it, if I had had Be∣za's book to compare with it. I have read that which Mr. Rutherford disputes against Erastus but it doth not satisfy me, in that he dictates ma∣ny things without proof, which are most necessary to be proved; and proves something by the sayings of Authors, that deserve to be examined; and ma∣ny times omits in reciting his Antagonists words, that which is either most or very material; and makes not his own answers punctual; which things Mr. Mather also chargeth him with, about another point; besides ma∣ny incoherent, and imperfect speeches, and inserting things impertinent. Besides in this dispute▪ I conceive, Mr. Rutherford doth yield that, which overthroweth that which he concludeth for. As when in his Divine right of Church-government chap. 4. q. 1. page 223. he hath these words, It is evident from the text Mat. 18. 15. that Christ speaks of such sins in a speciall manner committed against me or a particular brother, which
are within the verge of my power or his to pardor, as not being yet publick∣ly scandalous. which if true, then it can be meant onely of personal inju∣ries, which alone a private person hath power to pardon, and so is not an in∣stitution how to correct scandals under that notion, which Mr. Gillespy contends so much for, in his Aarons rod blossoming, book 2. chap. 9. page 295. and book 3. chap. 2. As for his agument from proportior, Christ did appoint this to be done in case of civill inuries, much more in scandals: it hath no strength to impose a thing as by Divine institution up∣on mens consciences; yea it is no better then a humane invention when only gathered by such reasoning; such arguments from proportions being weak probations, as rightly Mr. Rutherford Due right of Presbyteries chap. 2. sect. 2. page 37. and all Logicians acknowledge that an argument à com∣paratis is but Topical, yea easily overthrown if any disparity be assigned. And this is enough (though much more may be said) to shew that Mat. 18. 15, 16, 17. is impertinently alleadged, though it be one of the chief texs urged importunately for Church-government by Prelates, Indepen∣dents, Presbyterians, even the Assembly it self Advice concerning a Con∣fession of faith chap. 30. art. 2, 4. to prove a power of excommunicating for sins as scandalous, and so all scandals. And for the power of the keyes Mat. 16. 19. Mr. Rutherford chap. 3. q. 1. pag. 236. makes the power of the keyes to belong to Church-Rulers, that are the Stewards of the house, and the dspensers of the heavenly mysteries, but this may be only preaching the Gospel, of which the Apostle speaks 1 Cor. 4. 1. which place is impertinently alleadged in the Assemblies confession of faith chap. 27. art. 4. to prove, neither Sacrament may be dispensed by any, but a Minister of the word lawfull ordained, the Scripture no where calling the Sacraments mysteries, but the doctrine of the Gospel; however the Greek Fathers oft call them so. As for binding, and loosing though I conceive Dr. Hammond hath more exactly disputed this matter in his book of the power of keyes, chap. 4. then others, yet I conceive it more a∣greeable to other places in Matthew (leaving Mr. Selden to justify his ex∣plication in his preface to his book of the Calender of the Jewes out of the Talmudists as he conceives fit) as Mat. 23. 4. & 11. 28. besides Acts 15. 28. Revel. 2. 24. Luke 11. 46. to draw the Metaphor from bind∣ing and loosing burdens, rather then prisoners; which is confirmed in that the phrase is not [whomsoever] but [what things soever ye shall bind on earth] Mat. 18. 18. and this may very well stand with the coherence, signifying Gods ratifying in heaven the Commands of the Apostles, and the Church on earth in the matters wherein they are to be obeyed v. 17. and
so the binding and loosing belongs not to vindicative judicature as by Ex∣communication, but to Stewardly declarative authority what is to be done or not to be done; and consequently proves not juridical Excommunication. I add that Mr. Gillespy in his Aarons rod blossoming book 3. c. p. 412, 413. will not have binding and loosing by a dogmatical authoritative declaration of the will of Christ here excluded, but proves this sense from Mat. 28. 20. Acts 15. 28. and from the coherence with the 17. v. As for 1 Cor. 5. 5. Mr. Rutherfurd cha. 9. 4, 5. page 329. denieth not many learned Pro∣testants to conceive, that delivering to Satan might be a bodily punishment or conjoined therewith, &c. yea he addeth, and the learned Molineus denyeth delivering to Satan to be expounded of Excommunication, and will have the destruction of the flesh to be some bodily tormenting of his Body by Satar, and so do sundry of the Fathers, especially Ambrose, Hierony∣mus, Augustinus, and Chrysostome, though Augustin be doubtful; which if true it will be hard to prove juridical Excommunication now contended for from thence. And for the 13. v. if it be read as it may, And ye shall put a∣way, not, therefore put away & , not , the evil thing, not the evill person, as it's said to be in a Manuscript copy at Saint James, and is the more likely, because it seemes to many learned men, that the A∣postle tooke these phrases , v. 2. , v. 3.  or , from the Greek version, Deut. 17. 5, 7. and 22. 21, 22; 24. it will note, not a com∣mand, but an event; and so it may be either expounded impersonally, as Deut. 17. 7. ye shall put away the evil,Selden. l. 1. design. c 8. p 18. codices prisci, optim{que} habent . that is, the evil shall be put away from you, or if it be referred to their action, they may be said to do it, because they mourned that he might be taken away, ver. 2. and it was to be done when they were gathered together, ver. 4. now the phrase of ta∣king away from them, compared with those places in Deuteronomy, with the Apostles speech ver. 5. is more likely to be meant of killing then Ex∣communicating. And the putting it, ver. 13. in such an abrupt manner like to that, Deut. 17. 7. doth give great cause to imagine it hath the same sense. But if it be a command, and be referred to Excommunication with the judging them that are withir, ver. 12. yet it cannot be gathered from the text that this was the juridical Excommunication contended for, in∣vested in some Officers, or the people with the Officers as superiour judges: but rather by verses 9, 10, 11, 12. precedent, this judging and putting a∣way belongs to every private Christian jointly in a constituted Church, or severally by themselves. I have read Mr. Gillespies Aarons rod blossom∣ing,
and I think the strength of all is in the 9. chapter of his 2. book: in which I doubt whether any of his 21. arguments will prove such a fo∣rensical Ecclesiastick government, as he contends for. The argument from two distinct governments, and judicatories to censure vicious man∣ners (in which Mr. Gillespy in his first book seemes to be most elaberate) in the Jewish policy to prove the like to be among Christians is many wayes faulty. It will hardly be proved the Priests had peculiar cognizance of scandalous manners, or that any was kept from the sacrifices for moral uncleannesse, much lesse that the reason is good, men were kept away for legal uncleannesse from the sacrifices, Ergo much more for moral, or exclu∣sion for legal pollution typifies exclusion for moral in the Christian Church. You say truly in answer to Mr. Cotton first part of your Dissuasive chap. 7. pag, 172. There is no argumenting from symbolick types except where the spirit of God in Scripture apples a type to such a signification and use. Nor is the Jewish policy a patterne for us. If it were we must have a Bishop answering to an High Priest, a Parliament consisting of Bi∣shops and Nobles, as they had their Synedrium at Jerusalem of Priests and Elders of the People. These arguments cannot stand without asserting that the Jewish judicial lawes binde still. I have bin the larger in this, be∣cause in some writings especially of your Nation, to be an Erastian is now counted an high crime, and if the advice of the Assembly concern∣ing a confession of faith chap. 30. should be established as a law, assertion of a Church-government corrective of manners by censures in a juridical way would be pressed on us as of Divine institution distinct from the Civil Magistrate, which I conceive it concerns the Assertors better to prove, then yet appears they have done, or else they will in pressing it on others usurpe dominion over other mens fiath. But sure in many particulars I am not of Erastus his minde, and therefore you do ill to terme me a compleate Erastian. And though I find not by Bullingers and Gualther's letters to him, Beza's preface to his answer to his theses, Philip Pareus his Relation of his fathers life, and other wayes, but that Erastus had the repute of a werthy man, yet I take it all at your hands to be named by any name, but Christs, as you, and your fellow-Commissioners did take exception at the Apologetical narration of the five brethren for calling some Churches Cal∣vinian. But how do you prove me to be a compleat Erastian?
SECT. XVIII. Of the eighteenth Crimination, that I avow no scandalous pro∣fessor ought to be kept from the Lords Table. YOu say, that I avow that no scandalous professor ought to be kept from the Lords Table, and for proof, you referre your Reader to the letters N N, where some words of mine are recited out of my Apology page 92. which avow not any thing but my doubt, nor that of the thing it self, but of the proofe, and that not out of any Scripture whatsoever, but onely the fact of delivering to Satan the incestuous Corinthian, 1 Cor. 5. 5. Nor do I expresse my doubt to be how from that it may be conclu∣ded, that any scandalous professor ought to be kept from the Lords Table: but how hence may be concluded any power of suspension from the Lords Su∣per for every emergent scandal so judged by a Congregation or Congregational Presbytery. Yea to shew how ready you are to mis-report me, in the very next page of my Apology I have these words, And if it happen that any such facts be perperated as are like to that of the incestuous person, I doubt not but the whole Church may and ought to disclaime the person so offend∣ing, and to exclude him from all brotherly Communion, because I con∣ceive so much was done to the incestuous person; as I gather from 2 Cor. 2. 6, 7. So that my doubt was not of suspension for any, but for every e∣mergent scandal, for which the Assembly were so earnest with the Par∣liament. Many scandals there are in abuse of liberty in things indifferent, in sins of evil councel, and example which may happen through strength of temptation by infirmity in men not habitually vicios, which are not of that hainous nature, as to deserve keeping from the Lords Table; Nor doth the Scripture either prescribe such a thing to be done, or give power to do it. I like not Doctor Ames his determination lib. 4. de conscientiac. 29. num. 7. Proprium & adaequatum obeum hus censurae est scandalum datum fratre, which I imagine was the cause of the Assembly's mistake upon which they petitioned. SECT. XIX. Of the nineteenth Crimination of me, that I hold no censure of Fexcommunication. YOu further charge me, as avowing also that there is no such thing as any censure of Excommunicatior, and for proof you referre your Rea∣der
to the letters O O, where is cited one or two passages of my Apology, page 91. in neither of which do I avow any thing but my doubt, which is of 5. things, whereof one is, whether ever Excommunication a sacris, that is (as I after expresse my self) uridical, forensica, horitative, Ex∣communication by some officers, or the whole congregation as superious that have jurisdiction without special gift as the Apostles had, would be proved to be ure divino by Christs appointment. And I confesse I have still the same doubt, notwithstanding what I have read in Mr. Rutherford, Mr. Gillespy or any other. And I should be willing to be resolved, how citing to appear by power of office, keeping Courts or Assemblies, requi∣ring persons, yea of all sorts and qualities to answer as before Judges, ex∣amining witnesses, hearing causes, passing sentence, inflicting so great a punishment as Excommunication without liberty of Appeale (if by a na∣tional Assembly of Elders) on ministers and people, even the chiefest, not as Arbitrators to whom the parties referre the matter, but as Ecclesiastical Officers to whose judgement they must stand whether they will or no, will be acquitted from that dominion condemned Lu. 22. 25, 26. Mat. 20. 26. Mar. 10. 42, 43, 1 Pet. 5. 2, 3. as the Assertors of the Presbyterian discipline ex∣pound the texts against the Prelates; & what dominion more like the heathen the Prelates take upon them, then such an Assembly, and whether the Pre∣lates against whom you pleade may not acquit their Prelacy which they claime from the dominion you charge them with, out of these texts of Scri∣pture as well as you. But in this I do not avow, there is no such thing as any censure of Excommunitation, as you accuse me: yea I do expressely grant a social medicinal Excommunication by the whole Church from all brotherly communion with the whole, and by each member from arbitrary communion with himself,Allin defence of Ans. to 9 posit. p. 171. in case the fraternity without officers should cast out any, yet it is not alto∣gether the same with that which may be dis∣pensed by the officers thereof it being no offi∣ciall act. pro∣vided they do not rashly or unjustly exclude. And this I gather from 1 Cor. 5. 9, 10, 11. 2 Thess. 3. 6, 14, 15. and other places, as in my Apology page 93. may be seen. And I think the Congregational way in this nearer to the use of Excommunication in Scripture then the Presbyterian, though I think they misse in two things. 1. That they make it an act of superiority and jurisdiction, or, as they speak, of the power of the keyes in the whole Church over the person censured. 2. They a∣scribe this power only to that particular congregation of which the offender is a fixed member, which I conceive common to any other Church or bro∣ther in another Congregation, and is in effect nothing else but the non-com∣munion,
which they ascribe to one Church towards another. Nor do I conceive what other Excommunication Christians could in the primitive times exercise or did exercise one towards another, when Victor Bishop of Rome would have excommunicated Polycrates Bishop of Ephesus, or the Western the Eastern Church about Easter, or Stephanus of Rome Firmi∣lianus Bishop of Caesarca in Cappadocia holding with Cyprian about re∣baptization of persons baptized by heretiques, then this non-communion. And for the texts Mat. 16. 19. Mat. 18. 16, 17, 18. I am not yet mo∣ved from the interpretation I gave in my Apology page 91. but rather con∣ceive that I can prove it true, notwithstanding what I have read hitherto to the contrary. SECT. XX. Of the twentieth Crimination, that I hold Christ hath not appointed any particular government for his Church. YOu say further, That Christ hath not appointed any particular go∣vernment for his Church, and for proof hereof you referre the Rea∣der to the letters P P, at which you cite two passages of my Apology page 91. 93. of which neither sayes the thing you charge me with, the former onely making two things, according to my conceit, prudencial, to wit, the Independency or Dependency, and the fixednesse or moveablenesse of Pa∣stors, and Congregations. In the other I acknowledged a discipline pro∣per to the Church, and shewed what it was. And therefore you do ma∣nifestly wrong me in saying I avow a particular governmen, when my words expressely yield the contrary, onely I said, I suppose the manner of doing the thing is left to prudence, that is by whom, when, in what or∣der evils committed should be examined, the persons charged, admo∣nished, avoided, which I think you will not deny. Surely you will be hard put to it, to prove out of Scripture, the particularities of your, or any o∣ther discipline. To tell you my minde yet more plainly, the word go∣vernment comes from the Greeke , now , saith Suidas, he that guides ship by steering it. Being applied to men I conceive government is either by counsel, directing, admonishing, reproving in words or actions (as by shewing favour or dislike, in lookes,
embracing or shunning company, &c. giving example, &c. or by giving lawes, and inflicting punishments or giving rewards. I conceive Christ hath not left a particular government for his Church the latter way, but referres that unto himself, but in the former way he hath in the hands of some Officers, whom he hath made as Stewards in his house, whose go∣vernment consists chiefely in declaring the will of Christ, convincing gain∣sayers, ordaining Pastors to teach, and declaring alse teachers to be shun∣ned, and such like offices: but for the juridical government mentioned before I find it not appointed them by Christ. I like Hromes expression on Tit. 1. That the Churches comuni presbytr consilie, cura, so∣licitudine (not imperio) guvernabantur, and I like Salmasi his ob∣servation in his Apparatus de primatu Papae pag. 148.  primatu Papae part. 1. cap. 1. that the government of the Church is  urati, o∣ver-sight, not potestas, magistracy, empire. And this me thinks best suites with the Scriptures, 1 Thess. 5. 12. 1 Tim. 3. 5. Heb. 13. 7, 17. 1 Peter 5. 2, 3. SECT. XXI. Of the one & twentieth Crimination, that I hold that the govern∣ment of the Church belongs to the Magistrate onely. YOu add further, that I say, that the governing of the Church be∣longs to the Magistrate onely, and to such whom he appoints to that service by vertue of a Commission flowing from himself. And for proofe hereof you referre the Reader to the letters q q page 113. where you cite a passage out of my Apology page 93, which hath not a word of that you charge me with, but onely a declaration of my opinion in point of prudence, that the not devolving so much jurisdiction (as some desire) on a Presbytery doth not so much disadvantage the Church, as some con∣ceive, for reformation of manners, but onely for suppressing the dissenters in opinion, who are for the most part the most consciencious, and right-hearted; For usually the ruling Elders are Magistrates, or both teaching and ru∣ling Elders are chosen and act according to their minde, and serve their ends. And therefore if the Christian Magistrate be good, there's no great losse to the Church concerning the reforming of vicious manners, though
he Presbytery have not such power as some desire: if bad, little is done by the Presbytery. And for errors in opinion they are scarce ever amended by bare Excommunication, for that (if there be any number of dissenters) doth but u∣sually produce a schisme, but by teaching and cleering truth with meeknesse and forbearance one towards another, and a freedome to debate things in Sy∣nods, which is, I suppose, the proper use of them, and not to determine things and impose lawes the persons censured being never heard. This I said to allay the heate of men in engaging a Kingdome to warre upon such a cause. But because this is onely a point of prudence from experience I leave this to be considered by those that are better acquainted with hu∣mane affaires then I am. The thing you charge me with is no where as∣serted by me and therefore in this you also charge me falsely. SECT. XXII. Of my new way and boldnesse. THere are some other things in your book wherein you abuse me, as pag. 91. in your margine and table when you put Mr. ombes new way, and when you say, that at this time when so many new waies are in hand, I have thought meet to make a hotch-potch of many of them together; which is a meer reproachful or scoffical calumny, as if what I wrote, I did it out of a designe to make a new way of mine own. Whereas what I have said, I was necessitated to it, as I shew in my Apology, and was done in pur∣suance of the Covenant, and should have been taken with the right hand by men that are desirous to find out truth especially from one that you term learned, and with all his strength and greater diligence then any before him hath sifted a point. As for my boldnesse, I confesse God hath in mercy to me put more boldnesse and courage into me in this matter, then either agrees with my natural complexion, or the state of my affaires. But if you mean by saying that I am a very bold man, that I am one that is of an auda∣cious disposition to be a ringleader in a faction or an attempter of a desperate designe, or in any other bad sense (which it's likely you mean) you are de∣ceived, it being trueth which makes me bold, which I am the more bold to avouch to be so, because having tryed your strength with my other Antago∣nists, I find, that you defend that which I impugne by meer sleights.
SECT. XXIII. Of my silence concerning DIPPING, and of the novelty and insufficiency of SPRINKLING instead of baptizing. YOu say, that you have marked nothing to fall from my pen for the rite of dipping, or against the custome of sprinkling. And in the mar∣gine and the able at the end of your book you say, He is a rigid Antipaed∣baptist, but not against sprinkling. But this is more then you could infer from this, that I meddle not with this controversy in my writings. But though I say nothing, there's enough to be found of that innovation of sprinkling, in all sorts of authors. Mede in his Diatribe, or discourse on Tit. 3. 5. I dd, because perhaps some mens fancies are corrupted therewith, that there was no such thing as sprinkling or  used in baptism in the Apostles times, nor many ages after them; and therefore it is no way probable that  in St. Peter should have any reference to the Laver of baptsm. Salmasius Appar. ad librum de primatu Papae pag. 192. Non enim id  est quo hodie infantes initi∣ant, non mersio, non tctio, non lot, non lavarum, nec  ut eti∣am Graeci vocant, & vox Baptismi Graece significat, sed  asper∣sio vel infuo aquae. The like is in his Epistle ad Colvium pag. 669. An∣cient and later writers do generally avouch John Baptists and the Apo∣stles and Ancients use for many hundreds of yeares to have been by dipping or  under water: Salmasius Apparat. ad librum de primatu Pa∣pae pag. 193.

And sur.—the Lord meant not that the infant should be sprinckled onely;—but baptizea: which word signifieth the true act of the Ministery, to Di, or Do the Body, or some part of it into the water. And the  of Baptisme in te symbolicalnes of it, urgeth no.—What resemblance of our burial or resurrection with Christ is there in sprinkling?—So that—they loo more at themselves, then at God therein. And a little before he saith, To dip the infant—I so ave, as thinking it exceeding material to the Ordinance, and no sleigh: thing: Yea, which both Antiquity (—) constantly, and without exception of Countreys, hot or cold, witnesseth unto, and especially the constant word of the Holy Ghost, first and last approveth, as a learned Critick (Causan∣bon) in Mat. 3. hath noted.

Davenan. in Cl. 2. 12. &c. by the new Annot. on Mat. 20. 22. to have been the manner in Christs time; so that Keckerman. syst. Theolog. lib. 3. c. 8. saies, Non possu∣mus diffiteri primam institutionem baptismi immersion, non ver adsper∣sione constitisse, quod disertè patet ex cap 6. Roman. ver. 3. and 4. Casau∣bon. nnot. ad Mat. 3. 6. ; hic enim fuit bapti∣zandi ritu, ut in aquas immergerentur: quod vel ipsa vox  d∣clarat satis: quae ut non significat  quod est sundum petere cum sua pernicie: it à profecto non est . Differunt enim haec tri; . unde intelligimus, non esse abs re quod ampridem nonnulli disputacunt de toto corpore immergndo in ceremonia baptismi; vocem enim  urgebant. Sed horum sententia merito est jampr∣dem explosa: quum non in eo posita est mysterii hujus vis et . Ter∣tullian, who lived within lesse then a hundred years of some of the Apo∣stles, frequently calls Baptisme, Dipping; and saith the parties were Dip, Tincti: (never sprickled, aers, &c.) The like phrase hath Mus∣culus on Mat. 3. &c. The Dutl Bibles have it thus Mat. 3. 1. Johannes de Dooper. John the Diper, ghedoopt inden Jordaen ver. 6. he dipt them in Jordan. Mat. 28. 19. Doopende nden Nam-Dipping them in the Name. So in Mar. 1. 5, 9. Act. 8. 38, &c. So Mr. Thomas Goodwin holds out this manner of Baptizing fully, in his Treatise of Christ seforth in his Death, Burial—Section 3. chap. 7. It was questioned in the third
century whether the  or sprinkling or powring about of the element, that is, those who when they were sick on their beds and ready to dy, were baptized, were true baptism? Cyprian lib. 4. Epis. ad Manum. After it was questioned, whether a threefold immersion were necessary, or one would suffice?  sntent. lib. 4. distinct. 3. sect. 9. Aqun. 3. part. q. 66. art. 8. The Jewes, (from whom this rite is conceived to come,) took the baptisme wherein the whole body was not baptized, to be void, Selden de jure natur. & gent. uxta disi. Hebr. l. 2. c. 2. The force of the word is so manifest to signifie dipping, plunging, drowning, that Pi∣rus in his Pythia ode. 2. calls Corke swimming , upon the face of the waters unbaptized, and Plucerch a ship flo∣ting on the waters , unbaptized. Insomuch that I marvel greatly, that those who hold breaking of bread necessary, if not essential to the Lords Supper, having but example, use of the word, and allusion for it in Scripture; yea that are so stiffe for a table gesture; should upon such pre∣tences as these [that  sometimes signifies washing, that our Countreys are in a cold climate, or the like, alter so confirmed a , and determine that baptizing for the manner of doing , is not only , but sufficient, and most expedient to be by pouring or spriklin on the face of the child, in the Directory; and that dipping of the person into the water is not necessary: but baptisme is rightly administred by pouring or sprinkling water upon the person. Advice  confession of faith chap. 28.  3. and that so small a vessel should, according to their minds be set up, as that the Primitiv  cannot be continued by those that would, and perhaps do make conscience of it. SECT. XXIII. The Conclusion requiring reparation of the wrong done to me by Mr. Baillee. NOw Sir, I referre it to your self to judge whether any Author, Papist or Protestant, have in so small a compasse as one page of a leafe in 4. and some few lines in another so wronged his adversary, as you have done me in so many false accusations tending to beget prejudice against my
writing, and hatred against my person. Which I take the worse from you as being done not onely to a fellow-Christian, and a fellow-Prote∣stant, but also to a fellow-Minister of the Gospel, whose life and labours are not very obscure; yea to a fellow-Covenanter, and one with whom you ate bread at his and others invitation, out of the desire I had to hold amity with you, and the Churches from whence you came: nor do I know that I have done or spoken any thing that might tend to the contrary since: and this have you done in print, whereby it's likely to spread to many, and to re∣maine upon record to posterity, without any provocation by me, and with∣out any conference with me by word or writing, which might have sa∣tisfied you; though living not farre from you while you were fra∣ming your book; as I conceive you could not be ignorant from sundry passages in my Apolegy. The sin of false accusing is one of the sins, that makes times perilous, 2 Tim. 3. 3. from whence the enemy of mankind hath his name, and from whence much of our disunion, and misery comes. I do now write this letter to you being remote from you,Mr. Henry Scudder. as I did write to a neere friend before, to acquaint you with these exceptions against you; having an eye on the rule of Christ, Mat. 18. 15. that I may shew my desires of peace, and you may see trueth, and confesse your wronging of me, and may fully right me. If this do not take, I shall some other way endeavour to wash away the dirt cast in my face by you, and remaine Your brother and fellow-servant in Christ Jesus JOHN TOMBES Bewdley in Worcestershire. July 22. 1647. June 2. 1650. Imprimatur John Bachiler.
