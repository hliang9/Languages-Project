A Y T THE CELEBRATION OF THE ANNIVERSARY DAY OF HIS MAJESTIES BIRTH And RESTITUTION. May 29, 1630/60. TWas a rich dress great Englands Genius wore When she attended on her Lord to shore; When in her aemulous brav'ry of May Shee with rich garments strowd the Royall way; As if by Golden Jove shee ravisht seem'd, The Twins of Joy and Glory to have seem'd Oft had she strugled with renew'd mischance, Impregnant hopes of her deliverance; Till a ripe birth of Fate did Heaven send, Blest the beginning, and then Crown'd the end. Then her luxuriant pride could not devise A satisfaction to her curious eys; She view'd her self i'th glasse of her great fame, There frighted, as if shee were not the same, By monstrous shapes of Government deform'd, And all her pristine strength and beauty scorn'd, To forrain Triumphs shee addrest her sight, And skewd at them as falling Meteors flight: Her wondring looks at last fixt on her Prince, She took the measure of her greatness thence; The Arts of all Magnificence were scan'd, And the vast reach of mighty Glory span'd; While Jove himself did on her Monarch wait Th' observant clouds were th' Canopy of state, And gave the King the Empire of the day, That cheerfull time might on his Honour stay. Now doth this An'versary all renew And multipli'd reflect them to our view, This Happy Day, shall be the womb o'th year Our Peace and Plenty were begotten here: Indeed too scant a Festival for YOÆ², (The Birth and our Redemption make two,) Great Sir, your Crowded Blessings cannot lye Within the space in which one Sun doth dye; Take the whole revolution of Time And let there be no Holy-day but thine; And yet the pious world shall worship pay In this enough to every Sainted Day: Not all the miracles that have been wrought But may within thy Rubrick well be brought, While our Posterity shall learn to be Hereafter more Religious (Charles) for thee. Thus are our Raptures, and our Extasies, (When your first bright Approaches seiz'd our Eyes) Perpetuated into solid Joy, and thence Into Religion, whose blest Frankincense Ascends on high, and pleased Heav'n resumes Her weighty Favours in such thankful Fumes; Sublim'd thus by Divine and Sacred Art, Joy, like the vital Spirits fills our Heart. And may no other Passion swell the State, Nor these high stoods of Gladnesse e're Abate. James Heath, LONDON Printed in the Year, 1661.
