THE IDYLLIUMS OF THEOCRITUS WITH RAPIN'S Discourse OF PASTORALS Done into English. Hic igitur versus, & caetera ludicra pono; Quod verum at{que} bonum est inquiro, & totus in hoc sum. OXFORD, Printed by L. LICHFIELD, Printer to the Univer∣sity, for ANTHONY STEPHENS Bookseller near the Theatre 1684.
To His Honoured Friend ARTHƲR CHARLET A.M. Fellow of Trinity College in OXON. SIR, THis in its several parts being ad∣dress'd to my Intimate Acquain∣tance, desires a Patron of the same rank; and hath pitch'd on You as the most able to endure, and most ready to oblige by accepting a greater trouble than the rest: It is the defence of the Whole that you must be engag'd in, whilst the others singly are charged only with a Part: and in this I have fol∣lowed the example of the Antients, who tho they had one of the Lares to
preside over every little room, yet the whole house was dedicated to some Com∣mon Guardian: This Distinction pro∣ceeded either from a real inequality of Power in the Protectors, or from the difference of those benefits which They were suppos'd to have actually bestow∣ed: As to the former consideration, every one that knows my Friends will easily allow that each singly is sufficient for the whole, tho, by reason of my im∣perfections, a great task: But the lat∣ter, Sir, gives You the preference, and Gratitude forceth me to believe his po∣wer to be greatest, who hath most often, and most signally exprest it: Innume∣rable private Favours I must acknow∣ledge the same way they were bestow'd, and spare your Modesty and my own: for otherwise it wuld seem that I
thought there was some thing in my felf worth your notice; or else I must pub∣lickly proclaim, that You (which tho 'tis really your Case, yet very few can boast) are kind and generous without any prospect of return: But those which properly relate to the present oc∣casion I must beg leave to mention, since Pliny, and all agree, hath severely noted as the greatest Ingratitude not to acknowledge to whom we owe what we have attain'd; and it would argue stu∣pidity to run wilfully on that Censure, which hath been so justly pass'd, and so much applauded. You may remember Sir how often, when the publick Cares of your well-managed Office would permit you to retreat, we have retir'd to a Grove, where Quiet spreads all around, and a
springing verdure, and chequer'd va∣riety to raise the Thoughts and recre∣ate the Fancy; whilst soft breezes mur∣mur'd thro the Trees, which, like our Affections, serv'd only to intermix, but never to shatter or disturb: There I have enjoy'd whatever the Poets could imagine, a free innocent, and instructive discourse, such as reform'd my Errors, and incourag'd those Essays which you was pleas'd to think endea∣vors after vertue; till then I envied the happiness of the described Swains, and lookt on Virgil and Theocritus as disturbers of Man kind, who elaborately describ'd the most perfect and surprizing Beautys, but gave us no Hopes either to see or to enjoy. The Golden age was their scene, and 'twas necessary to look beyond Jupiter him∣self
to find any thing innocent or pleas∣ing; and how tedious such a search must be; every one may imagine, who consi∣ders that 'tis very hard to take so large a prospect, especially when there is no∣thing but a bare Contemplation to ex∣cite, and reward his Diligence. The time Sir, I found brought back a∣gain by your conversation, and all those difficulties () which were so even to a Proverb, practically explain'd: so that what∣ever in this performance is drawn soft, innocent, and pleasing; is but a Copy from You the Original: This is the happiness that attends polite Learn∣ing, it smooths all the natural Asperi∣ties of Humor and Passion, and spreads an obligeing tenderness thro the whole Man, And where the Cause
is in so eminent a degree, and the Ef∣fect too necessary, what can hinder the Production? These are the reasons that have determin'd my acknowledge∣ments for former, and given me en∣couragement to beg a new Obligation, To accept this, and pardon its defects will be a very considerable one to Sir, Your most Humble Servant THOMAS CREECH. All-Souls Coll. July 12. 1684.
A TREATISE de CARMINE PASTORALI Written by RAPIN. The First Part. TO be as short as possible in my discourse upon the present Subject, I shall not touch upon the Excellency of Poetry in general; nor repeat those high Encomiums, (as that tis the most divine of all human Arts, and the like) which Plato in his Jone, Aristotele in his Poetica, and other Learned men have copiously insisted on: And this I do that I might more closely and briefly pursue my present design, which, no doubt▪ will not please every man; for since I treat of that part of Poetry, which (to use Quintilian's words) by reason of its Clownishness, is affraid of the Court and City; some may imagine that I follow Nichocaris his humor, who would paint only the most ugly and deform'd, and those too in the meanest and most frightful dress, that real, or fancy'd Poverty could put them in.
For some think that to be a Sheapard is in it self mean, base, and sordid; And this I think is the first thing that the graver and soberer sort will be ready to object. But if we consider how honorable that em∣ployment is, our Objectors from that Topick will be easily answer'd: for as Heroick Poems owe their dignity to the Quality of Heroes, so Pastorals to that of Sheapards. Now to manifest this, I shall not rely on the authority of the Fabulous, and Heroick Ages, tho, in the former, a God fed Sheep in Thessaly, and in the latter, Hercules the Prince of Heroes, (as Paterculus stiles him) graz'd on mount Aventine: These Examples, tis true, are not convinceing, yet they sufficiently shew that the employment of a Sheapard was sometime look'd upon to be such, as in those Fabulous times was not alltogether unbecomeing the Dignity of a Heroe, or the Divi∣nity of a God: which consideration if it cannot be of force enough to procure excellence, yet certainly it may secure it from the imputation of baseness, since it was sometime lookt upon as fit for the greatest in Earth or Heaven. But not to insist on the authority of Poets, sa∣cred Writt tells us that Jacob and Esau, two great men, were Sheapards; And Amos, one of the Royal Family, asserts the same of himself, for He was among the Sheapards of Tecua, following that employment: The like by Gods own appoint∣ment
prepared Moses for a Scepter, as Philo in∣timates in his life, when He tells us, that a Sheap∣ards Art is a suitable preparation to a Kingdome; the same He mentions in the Life of Joseph, affirm∣ing that the care a Sheapard hath over his Cattle, very much resembles that which a King hath over his Subjects: The same Basil in his Homily de S. Mamm. Martyre hath concerning David, who was taken from following the Ews great with young ones to feed Israel, for He says that the Art of feeding and governing are very near akin, and even Sisters: And upon this account I suppose twas, that Kings amongst the Greeks reckoned the name of Sheapard one of their greatest titles, for, if we believe Varro, amongst the Antients, the best and bravest was still a Sheapard: Every body knows that the Romans the worthiest and greatest Nation in the World sprang from Sheap∣ards: The Augury of the Twelve Vulturs plac't a Scepter in Romulus's hand which held a Crook before; and at that time, as Ovid says, His own small Flock each Senator did keep. Lucretius mentions an extraordinary happi∣ness, and as it were Divinity in a Sheaperd's life, Thro Sheapards ease, and their Divine retreats. And this is the reason, I suppose, why the solitude of the Country, the shady Groves, and se∣curity of that happy Quiet was so grateful to the Muses, for thus Horace represents them,
The Muses that the Country Love. Which Observation was first made by Mnas∣alce the Sicyonian in his Epigram upon Venus. The Rural Muse upon the Mountains feeds. For sometimes the Country is so raveshing and delightful, that twill raise Wit and Spirit even in the dullest Clod, And in truth, amongst so many heats of Lust and Ambition which usually fire our Citys, I cannot see what retreat, what comfort is left for a chast and sober Muse. And to speak from the very bottome of my heart, (not to mention the integrity and inno∣cence of Sheapards upon which so many have in∣sisted, and so copiously declaimed) methinks he is much more happy in a Wood, that at ease con∣templates this universe, as his own, and in it, the Sun and Stars, the pleasing Meadows, shady Groves, green Banks, stately Trees, flowing Springs, and the wanton windings of a River, fit objects for quiet innocence, than he that with Fire and Sword disturbs the World, and mea∣sures his possessions by the wast that lys about him: Augustus in the remotest East fights for peace, but how tedious were his Voyages? how troublesome his Marches? how great his disqui∣ets? what fears and hopes distracted his designs? whilst Tityrus contented with a little, happy in the enjoyment of his Love, and at ease under his spreading Beech. Taught Trees to sound his Amaryllis name.
On the one side Melibaeus is forc't to leave his Country, and Antony on the other; the one a Sheapard, the other a great man, in the Com∣mon-Wealth; how disagreeable was the Event? the Sheapard could endure himself, and sit down contentedly under his misfortunes, whilst lost Antony, unable to hold out, and quitting all hopes both for himself and his Queen, became his own barbarous Executioner: Than which sad and deplorable fall I cannot imagine what could be worse, for certainly nothing is so miserable as a Wretch made so from a flowrishing & happy man; by which tis evident how much we ought to prefer before the gaity of a great and shining State, that Idol of the Crowd, the lowly sim∣plicity of a Sheapards Life: for what is that but a perfect image of the state of Innocence, of that golden Age, that blessed time, when Sincerity and Innocence, Peace, Ease, and Plenty inhabited the Plains? Take the Poets description Here Lowly Innocence makes a sure retreat, A harmless Life, and ignorant of deceit, And free from fears with various sweet's encrease, And all's or'e spread with the soft wings of Peace: Here Oxen low, here Grots, and purling Streams, And spreading shades invite to easy dreams. And thus Horace. Happy the man beyond pretence Such was the state of Innocence, &c.
And from this head I think the dignity of Bu∣oolicks is sufficiently cleared, for as much as the Golden Age is to be preferr'd before the Heroick, so much Pastorals must excell Heroick Poems: yet this is so to be understood, that if we look up∣on the majesty and loftiness of Heroick Poems, it must be confest that they justly claim the prehe∣minence; but if the unaffected neatness, elegant, graceful smartness of the expression, or the po∣lite dress of a Poem be considered, then they fall short of Pastorals: for this sort flows with Sweet, Elegant, neat and pleasing fancies; as is too evident to every one that hath tasted the sweeter muses, to need a farther explication: for tis not probable that Asinius Pollio, Cinna, Varius, Cornelius Gallus, men of the neatest Wit, and that lived in the most polite Age, or that Au∣gustus Caesar the Prince of the Roman elegance, as well as of the common Wealth, should be so ex∣treamly taken with Virgils Bucolicks, or that Vir∣gil himself a man of such singular prudence, and so correct a judgment, should dedicate his Ec∣logues to those great Persons; unless he had known that there is somewhat more then ordina∣ry Elegance in those sort of Composures, which the wise perceive, tho far above the understand∣ing of the Crowd: nay if Ludovicus Vives, a ve∣ry learned man, and admired for politer studies may be believed, there is somewhat more sublime and excellent in those Pastorals, than the Common
sort of Grammarians imagine: This I shall dis∣course of in an other place, and now inquire into the Antiquity of Pastorals. Since Linus, Orpheus, and Eumolpus were famous for their Poems,The Anti∣quity of Pastoral. before the Trojan wars; those are certain∣ly mistaken, who date Poetry from that time; I rather incline to their opinion who make it as old as the World it self; which Asser∣tion as it ought to be understood of Poetry in ge∣neral, so especially of Pastoral, which, as Scaliger delivers, was the most antient kind of Poetry, and resulting from the most antient way of Liveing: Singing first began amongst Sheapards as they fed their Flocks, either by the impulse of nature, or in imitation of the notes of Birds, or the whispering of Trees. For since the first men were either Sheapards or Ploughmen, and Sheapards, as may be gathered out of Thucydides and Varro, were before the others, they were the first that either invited by their leisure, or (which Lucretius thinks more probable) in imitation of Birds, began a tune. Thro all the Woods they heard the pleasing noise Of chirping Birds, and try'd to frame their voice, And Imitate, thus Birds instructed man, And taught them Songs before their Art began. In short, tis so certain that Verses first began in the Country that the thing is in it self evident, and this Tibullus very plainly signifies,
First weary at his Plough the labouring Hind In certain feet his rustick words did bind: His dry reed first he tun'd at sacred feasts To thank the bounteous Gods, and cheer his Guests. In certain feet according to Bern Cylenius of Verona his interpretation in set measures: for Cen∣sorinus tells us, that the antient Songs were loose and not ty'd up to any strict numbers, and after∣wards by certain laws and acknowledged rules were confin'd to such and such measures: for this is the method of Nature in all her works, from imperfect and rude beginnings things take their first rise, and afterwards by fit and appo∣site additions are polish't, and brought to per∣fection: such were the Verses which heretofore the Italian Sheapards and Plough-men, as Vir∣gil says, sported amongst themselves. Italian Plough-men sprung from antient Troy Did sport unpolish't Rhymes— Lucretius in his Fifth Book de Natura Rerum, says, that Sheapards were first taught by the rush∣ing of soft Breezes amongst the Canes to blow their Reeds, and so by degrees to put their Songs in tune. For Whilst soft Evening Gales blew or'e the Plains And shook the sounding Reeds, they taught the Swains, And thus the Pipe was fram'd, and tuneful Reed, And whilst the Flocks did then securely feed, The harmless Sheapards tun'd their Pipes to Love,
And Amaryllis name fill'd every Grove. From all which tis very plain that Poetry be∣gan in those days, when Sheapards took up their employment: to this agrees Donatus in his Life of Virgil, and Pontanus in his Fifth Book of Stars, as appears by these Verses. Here underneath a shade by purling Springs The Sheapards Dance, whilst sweet Amyntas sings; Thus first the new found Pipe was tun'd to Love, And Plough-men taught their Sweet hearts to the Grove, Thus the Fescennine jests when they sang har∣vest-home, and then too the Grape-gatherers and Reapers Songs began, an elegant example of which we have in the Tenth Idyllium of Theocri∣tus. From this birth, as it were, of Poetry, Verse began to grow up to greater matters; For from the common discourse of Plough-men and Sheap∣ards, first Comedy, that Mistress of a private Life, next Tragedy, and then Epick Poetry which is lofty and Heroical arrose, This Maximus Tyrius con∣firms in his Twenty first dissetation, where he tells us that Plough-men just comeing from their work, and scarce cleansed from the filth of their employment, did use to flurt out some sudden and extempore Catches; and from this beginning Plays were produc'd, and the Stage erected: Thus
much concerning the Antiquity, next of the Ori∣ginal of this sort. About this Learned men cannot agree, for who was the first Author, is not sufficiently un∣derstood; Donatus, tis true, tells us tis proper to the Golden Age, and therefore must needs be the product of that happy time: but who was the Author, where, what time it was first invented hath been a great Controversy, and not yet suffi∣ciently determined: Epicharmus one of Pythago∣ras his School, in his  mentions one Dio∣mus a Sicilian, who, if we believe Athoenoeus was the first that wrote Pastorals: those that fed Cattle had a peculiar kind of Poetry, call'd Bucolicks, of which Dotimus a Sicilian was inventer: Diodorus Siculus , seems to make Daphnis the son of Mercury and a certain Nymph, to be the Author; and agreeable to this, Theon an old Scholiast on Theocritus, in his notes upon the first Idyllium mentioning Daphnis, adds, he was the Author of Bucolicks, and Theocritus him∣self calls him the Muses Darling: and to this Opi∣nion of Diodorus Siculus Polydore Virgil readily assents. Br Mnaseas of Patara in a discourse of his concning Europa, speaks thus of a Son of Pan the God of Sheapards: Panis Filium Bubulcum à quo & Bucolice canere: Now whether Mnaseas by that Bubulcum, means only a Herds-man, or one skilled in Bucolicks, is uncertain: but if Valla's
judgment be good, tis to be taken of the latter: yet Aelian was of another mind, for he boldly affirms that Stesichorus called Himeroeus was the first, and in the same place adds, that Daphnis the Son of Mercury was the first Subject of Bucolicks. Some ascribe the Honor to Bacchus the Presi∣dent of the Nymphs, Satyrs, and the other Country Gods, perhaps because he delighted in the Coun∣try; and others attribute it to Apollo called No∣mius the God of Sheapards, and that he invented it then when he served Admetus in Thessaly, and fed his Herds: For, tis likely, he to recreate him∣self, and pass away his time, applied his mind to such Songs as were best suitable to his present condition: Many think we owe it to Pan the God of Sheapards, not a few to Diana that ex∣treamly delighted in solitude and Woods; and some say Mercury himself: of all which whilst Grammarians prattle, according to their usual custome they egregiously trifle; they suffer them∣selves to be put upon by Fables, and resign their judgment up to foolish pretentions, but things and solid truth is that we seek after. As about the Author, so concerning the place of its Birth there is a great dispute, some say Sparta, others Peloponesus, but most are for Sicily. Valla the Placentine, a curious searcher into An∣tiquity, thinks this sort of Poetry first appeard amongst the Lacedemonians, for when the Persians had wasted allmost all Greece, the Spartans say
that they fot fear of the Barbarians fled into Caves and lurking holes; and that the Country Youth then began to apply themselves in Songs to Diana Caryatis, together with the Maids, who midst their Songs offerd Flowers to the Goddess: which custome containing somewhat of Religion was in those places a long time very scrupulously observed. Diomedes the Grammarian, in his treatise of Measures, declares Sicily to be the Place: for thus he says, the Sicilian Sheapards in time of a great Pestilence, began to invent new Ceremonies to appease incensed Diana, whom afterward, for affording her help, and stopping the Plague they called : i. e. the Freer from their Miserys. This grew into custom, and the Sheapards used to meet in Companies, to sing their deliverer Diana's praise, and thse afterwards passing into Italy wee there namd Bucoliastoe. Pomponius Sabinus tells the story thus: When the Hymns the Virgins us'd to sing in the Coun∣try to Diana were left off, because, by reason of the present Wars, the Maidens were forc't to keep close within the Towns; the Shepherds met, and sang those kind of Songs, which are now call'd Bucolicks, to Diana; to whom they could not give the usual worship by reason of the Wars: But Donatus says, that this kind of Verses was first sung to Diana by Orestes, when he wandred about Italy; after he fled from Scythia Taurica, and had
taken away the Image of the Goddess, and hid it in a bundle of sticks, whence she receiv'd the name of Pascelina, or Phacelide ; At whose Altar, the very same Orestes was afterward expia∣ted by his Sister Iphigenia: But how can any one rely on such Fables, when the inconsiderable Authors that propose them disagree so much a∣mongst themselves? Some are of Opinion that the Shepherds, were wont in solem and set Songs about the Fields and Towns to celebrate the Goddess Pales; and beg her to bless their flocks and fields with a plente∣ous encrease, and that from hence the name, and composure of Bucolicks continued. Other prying ingenious Men make other con∣jectures, as to this mazing Controversy thus Vossius delivers himself; The Antients cannot be re∣concil'd, but I rather incline to their opinion who think Bucolicks were invented either by the Sicilians or Pe∣loponesians, for both those use the Dorick Dialect, and all the Greek Bucolicks are writ in that: As for my self I think, that what Horace says of Elegies may be apply'd to the present Subject. But who soft Elegies was the first that wrote Grammarians doubt, and cannot end the doubt: For I find nothing certain about this matter, since neither Valla a diligent inquirer after, and a god judge in such things, nor any of the late writers produce any thing upon which I can safely rely: yet what beginning this kind of Poetry
had, I think I can pretty well conjecture: for tis likely that first Shepherds us'd Songs to recreate themselves in their leisure hours whilst they fed their Sheep; and that each man, as his wit served, accommodated his Songs to his present Circum∣stances: to this Solitude invited, and the extream leisure that attends that employment absolutely requir'd it: For as their retirement gave them leisure, and Solitude a fit place for Meditation, Meditation and Invention produc'd a Verse, which is nothing else but a Speech fit to be sung, and so Songs began: Thus Hesiod was made a Poet, for he acknowledges himself that he re∣ceiv'd his inspiration; Whilst under Helicon he fed his Lambs. for either the leisure, or fancy of Shepherds seems to have a natural aptitude to Verse. And indeed I cannot but agree with Lucretius that accurate Searcher into Nature, who delivers that from that state of Innocence the Golden Age, Pastorals continued down to his time, for after he had in his fifth book describ'd that most happy age, he adds, For then the Rural Muses reign'd. From whence 'tis very plain, that as Donatus himself observ'd, Pastorals were the invention of the simplicity and innocence of that Golden age, if there was ever any such, or certainly of that time which succeeded the beginning of the World: For tho the Golden Age must be ac∣knowledged
to be only in the fabulous times, yet 'tis certain that the Manners of the first Men were so plain and simple, that we may easily de∣rive both the innocent imployment of Shepherds, and Pastorals from them.
The Second PART. NOw let us inquire into the nature of Pasto∣ral, in what its excellencies consist, and how it must be made to be exact: And this must needs be a hard Task, since I have no guide, nei∣ther Aristotle nor Horace to direct me, for both they, whatever was the matter, speak not one word of this sort of Verse. And I am of opinion that none can treat well and clearly of any kind of Poetry if he hath no helps from these two: But since they lay down some general Notions of Po∣etry which may be useful in the present case, I shall follow their steps as close as possible I can. Not only Aristotle but Horace too hath de∣fin'd that Poetry in general is Imitation; I mention only these two, for tho Plato in his Second Book de Rep. and in his Timoeus delivers the same thing, I shall not make use of his Au∣thority at all: Now as Comedy according to A∣ristotle is the Image and Representation of a gentiel and City Life, so is Pastoral Poetry of a County and Sheapards Life; for since Poetry in general is Imitation; its several Species must likewise Imitate, take Aristotles own words Cap. 1. ; And these Species are
differenc't either by the subject matter, when the things to be imitated are quite different, or when the manner in which you imitate, or the mode of imitation is so: : Thus tho of Epick Poetry and Tragedy the Subject is the same, and some great illustrious Action is to be imitated by both, yet since one by representation, and the other by plain narration imitates, each makes a diffe∣rent Species of imitation. And Comedy and Trage∣dy, tho they agree in this, that both represent, yet because the Matter is different, and Tragedy must represent some brave action, and Comedy a humor; these Two sorts of imitation are Specifi∣cally different. And upon the same account, since Pastoral chooses the mannes of Sheapards for is imitation, it takes from its matter a peculiar dif∣ference, by which it is distinguish'd frō all others. But here Benius in his comments upon Aristotle hath started a considerable query: which is this; Whether Aristotle, when be reckons up the diffe∣rent Species of Poetry Cap 1. doth include Pastoral, or no? And about this I find learn'd men cannot at all agree: which certainly Benius should have determin'd, or not rais'd: some refer it to that sort which was sung to Pipes, for that Pastorals were so Apuleius intimates, when at the marriage Feast of Phyche He brings in Paniscus singing Bucolicks to his Pipe: But since they did not seriously enough consider, what Aristotle
meant by that which he calls they trifle, talk idly, and are not to be heeded in this mat∣ter; For suppose some Musitian should sing Vir∣gils Aenoeis to the Harp, (and Ant. Lullus says it hath been done,) should we therefore reckon that divine and incomparable Master of Heroick Poetry amongst the Lyricks? Others with Coesius Bassus and Isacius Tzetzes hold that that distribution of Poetry, which Aristo∣tle and Tully hath left us, is deficient and imper∣fect▪ and that only the chief Species are reck∣one, but the more inconsiderable not mention'd: I shal not here interest my self in that quarrel of the Critiks, whether we have all Aristotles books of Poety o no this is a considerable difficulty I cfess, fo Laertius who accurately weighs this tte, says that he wrote two books of Poetry, the one lst, and the other we have, tho Mu∣tinensis is of an other mind: but to end this dis∣pute, I must agree wit Vossius, who says the Philo∣sopher compeended these Species not expressly mentioned, under a higher and more noble head: and tha therefore Pastoral was contain'd in Epick. for these are his on words, besides there are E∣picks of an inferior rank, such as the Writers of Bu∣colicks. Sincerus, as Minturnus quotes him, is of the same mind, for thus he delivers his opinion concerning Epick Verse: The matters about which these numbers may be employed is various, either mean and low, as in Pastorals, great and lofty, as when
the Subject is Divine Things, or Heroick Actions, or of a middle rank, as when we use them to deliver precepts in: And this likewise e signifys before, where he sets down three sorts of Epicks one of which, says he, is divine, and the most excellent by much in all Poetry; the other the lowest but most pure, in which Theocritus excelled, which indeed shews nothing of Poetry beside the bare numbers: These points being thus settled, the remaining difficul∣tys will be more easily dispatched. For as in Dramatick Poetry the Dignity and meanness of the Persons represented make two dif∣fferent Species of imitation the one Tragick▪ ch agrees to none but great and lustrious persons, the other Comick, which suits with common and gentile humors: so in Epick too there may be reck∣oned two sorts of Imitation, one of which blons to Heroes, and that makes the eroick; the other to Rusticks and Sheapards and that constitutes the Pastoral, now as a Picture imitates the Fetus of the face, so Poetry doth action, and is not a representation of the Person but the Action. From all which we may gather this definition of Pastoral:The Definition of Pastoral. It is the imi∣tation of the Action of a Sheapard, or of one taken under that haracter: Thus Virgil's Gallus, tho not eally a Sheapard, for he was a man of great quality in Rome, et belongs to Pastoral, becuse he is represented like a Sheapard: hece the oet:
The Goatherd and the heavy Heardsmen came, And ask't what rais'd the deadly lame. The Scene lys amongst Sheapards, the Swains are brought in, the Herdsmen come to see his mi∣sery, and the fiction is suited to the real condi∣tion of a Sheapard; the same is to be said for his Si∣lenus, who tho he seems lofty, and to sound to loud for an oaten reed, yet since what he sings he sings to Sheapards, and suits his Subject to their apprehensions, his is to be acknowledged Pasto∣ral. his rule we must stick to, that we might infallibly discern what is stricktly astoral in Vir∣gil and Theocritus, and what not: for in Theocri∣tus there are some more lofty thoughts which not having any thing belonging to Sheapards for their Subject, must by no means be accounted Pastoral, But of this more in its proper place. My present inquiry must be what is the Subject Matter of a Pastoral, about which it is not easy to resolve; since neither from Aristotle, nor any of the Greeks who have written Pastorals, we can receive certain direction. For sometimes they treat of high and sublime things, like E∣pick Poets; what can be loftier than the whole Seaventh Idyllium of Bias in which Myrsan urges Lycidas the Sheapard to sing the Loves of Deida∣mia, and Achilles. For he begins from Helen's rape, and goes on to the revengful fury of the Atrides, and shuts up in one Pastoral, all that is gret and sounding in Homers Iliad.
Sparta was fir'd with Rage And gatherd Greece to prosecute Revenge. And Theocritus his verses are sometimes as soundin and his thoughts as high: for upon se∣riu csideraion I cannot mind what part of all the Heroicks is so strong and sounding as that Idyllium on ercules  in which Hercules himslf tells hyleus how he kill'd the Lyon whose Skin he wre: for, not to mon many, what can be greater than this expression. And gaping ell received his mighty Soul: Why shoud▪ instance in the , which hath no nne below Heroick; the greatness of this is allmost inexpressible. . And some other pieces are as strong as these, such is the Panegyrick on Ptolemy, Helen's Epitha∣lamium, and the fight of young Hercules and the Snakes: now how is it likely that such Subjects should be fit for Pastorals, of which, in my opi∣nion, the same may be said which Ovid doth of his Cydippe. Cydippe, Homer, doth not fit thy Muse. For certainly Pastorals ought not to rise to the Majesty of Heroicks: but who on the other side
dares reprehend such great and judicious Au∣thors, whose very doing it is Authority enough? What shall I say of Virgil? who in his Sixth Ec∣logue hath put together allmost all the particulars of the fabulous Age; what is so high to which Silenus that Master of Mysterys doth not soar? For lo! he sung the Worlds stupendious birth, How scatter'd seeds of Sea, of Air, and Earth, And purer Fire thro universal night And empty space did fruitfully unite: From whence th' innumerable race of things By circular successive order springs: And afterward How Pyrra's Stony race rose from the ground, And Saturn reign'd with Golden plenty crown'd, How bold Prometheus (whose untam'd desire, Rivald the Sun with his own Heavenly Fire) Now doom'd the Scythian Vulturs endless prey Severely pays for Animating Clay. So true, so certain 'tis, that nothing is so high and lofty to which Bucolicks may not successfully aspire. But if this be so, what wil becom of Macrobius, Georgius Valla, Julius caliger, Vos∣sius, and the whole company of Grammarians? who all affirm that simplicity and meanness is so essential to Pastorals that it ought to be confi'd to the State, Manners, Apprehension and even common phrases of Sheapards: for nothing cn
be said to be Pastoral, which is not accommoda∣ted to their condition: and for this Reason Nan∣nius Alcmaritanus in my opinion is a trifler, who, in his comments on Virgils Eclogues, thinks that those sorts of Composures may now and then be lofty, and treat of great subjects: where he like∣wise divides the matter of Bucolicks, into Low, Middle, and High and makes Virgil the Author of this Division, who in his Fourth Eclogue, (as he imagines) divides the matter of Bucolicks into Three sorts, and intimates this division by these three words: Bushes, Shrubs and Woods. Sicilian Muse begin a loftier strain, The Bushes and the Shrubs that shade the Plain Delight not all; if I to Woods repair My Song shall make them worth a Consuls Care. By Woods, as he fancys, as Virgil means high and stately Trees, so He would have a great and lofty Subject to to be implyed, such as he de∣signed for the Consul: by Bushes, which are al∣most even with the ground, the meanest and low∣est argument; and by Shrubs a Subject not so high as the one, nor so low as the other, as the thing it-self is. And therefore these lines If I to Woods repair My Song shall make them worth a Consuls care.
are thus to be understood, That if we choose high and sublime arguments, our work will be fit for the Patronage of a Consul, This is Nanni∣u's interpretation of that place; too pedantial and subtle I'me affraid, for 'tis not credible that ever Virgil thought of reckoning great and lofty things amongst the Subjects of bucolicks especially since When his Thalia rais'd her bolder Voice And Kings and Battles were her lofty choice, Phaebus did twitch his Ear, mean thoughts infuse, And with this whisper check't th' inspiring Muse: A Sheapard, Tityrus, his Sheep should feed, And choose a Subject suited to his reed, This certainly was a serious admonition im∣plyed by the twitching of his Ear, and I be∣lieve if he had continued in this former humor and not obey'd the smarring admonition. He had still felt it: so far was he from thinking Kings and Battels fit Themes for a Sheapards song: and this evidently shows that in Virgils opinion, con∣trary to Nanniu's fancy, great things cannot in the least be comprehended within the subject matter of Pastorals; no, it must be low and hum∣ble, which Theocritus very happily expresseth by this word i. e. as the interpreters ex∣plain it, sing humble Strains. Theefore let Pastoral never venture upon a
lofty subject, let it not recede one jot from its proper matter, but be employ'd about Rustick affairs: such as are mean and humble in themselves; and such are the affairs of Shepherds, especially their Loves, but those must be pure and innocent; not disturb'd by vain suspitious jealousy, nor pol∣luted by Rapes; The Rivals must not fight, and their emulations must be without quarrellings: such as Vida meant. Whilst on his Reed he Shepherds stifes conveys, And soft complaints in smooth Sicilian lays. To these may be added Sports, Jests, Gifts, and Presents; but not costly, such are yellow Ap∣ples, young stock-Doves, Milk, Flowers, and the like; all things must appear delightful and easy, nothing vitious and rough: A persidious Pimp, a designing Jilt, a gripeing Usurer, a craf∣ty factious Servant must have no room there, but every part must be full of the simplicity of the Golden-Age, and of that Candor which was then eminent: for as Juvenal affirms Baseness was a great wonder in that Age; Sometimes Funeral-Rites are the subject of an Eclogue, where the Shepherds scatter flowers on the Tomb, and sing Rustick Songs in honor of the Dead: Examples of this kind are left us by Virgil in his Daphnis, and Bion in his Adonis, and this hath nothing disagreeable to a Shepherd: In
short whatever, the decorum being still preserv'd, can be done by a Sheapard, may be the Subject of a Pastoral. Now there may be more kinds of Subjects than Servius or Donatus allow, for they confine us to that Number which Virgil hath made use of, tho Minturnus in his second Book de Poetâ declares a∣gainst this opinion: But as a glorious Heroick action must be the Subject of an Heroick Poem, so a Pastoral action of a Pastoral; at least it must be so turn'd and wrought, that it might appear to be the action of a Shepherd; which caution is ve∣ry necessary to be observ'd, to clear a great many difficulties in this matter: for tho as the Inter∣preters assure us; most of Virgils Eclogues are about the Civil war, planting Colonys, the mur∣der of the Emperor, and the like, which in them∣selves are too great and too lofty for humble Pastoral to reach, yet because they are accomo∣dated to the Genius of Shepherds, may be the Subject of an Eclogue, for that sometimes will admit of Gods and Heroes so they appear like, and are shrouded under the Persons of Shep∣herds: But as for these matters which neither re∣ally are, nor are so wrought as to seem the acti∣ons of Shepherds, such are in Moschus's Europa, Theocritus's Epithalamium of Helen, and Virgil's Pollio, to declare my opinion freely, I cannot think them to be fit Subjects for Bucolicks: And upon this account I suppose 'tis that Servius in his
Comments on Virgil's Bucolicks reckons only se∣ven of Virgil's ten Eclogues, and onely ten of Theocritus's thirty, to be pure Pastorals, and Sal∣masius upon Solinus says, that amongst Theocritus's Poems there are some which you may call what you please Beside Pastorals: and Heinsius in his scholia upon Theocritus will allow but Ten of his Idylliums to be Bucoliks, 1.2.3.4.5.6.7.8.9.11. for all the rest are deficient either in matter or form, and from this number of pure pastoral Idylliums I am apt to think, that Theocritus seems to have made that Pipe, on which he tun'd his Pastorals and which he consecrated to Pan of ten Reeds, as Sal∣masius in his notes on Theocritus's Pipe hath learn∣edly observed: in which two Verses always make one Reed of the Pipe, therefore all are so unequal, like the unequal Reeds of a Pipe, that if you put two equals together which make one Reed, the whole ine∣quality consists in ten pairs; when in the common Pipes there were usually no more then seven Reeds, and this the less curious observers have heedlessly past by Some are of opinion that whatever is done in the Country, and in one word, every thing that hath nought of the City in it may be treated o in Pastorals; and that the discourse of Fishers, Plow-men, Reapers, Hunters, and the like, be∣long to this kind of Poetry: which according to the Rule that I have laid down cannot be true for, as I before hinted nothing but the action of a
Shepherd can be the Subject of a Pastoral. I shall not here enquire, tho it may seem pro∣per whether we can decently bring into an Ec∣logue Reapers, Vine-dressers, Gardners, Fowlers, Hunters, Fishers, or the like, whose lives for the most part are taken up with too much busi∣ness and employment to have any vacant time for Songs, and idle Chat, which are more a∣greeable to the leisure of a Sheapards Life: for in a great many Rustick affairs, either the hardship and painful Labor will not admit a song, as in Plowing, or the solitude as in hunting, Fishing, Fowling, and the like; but of this I shall dis∣course more largely in another place. Now 'tis not sufficient to make a Poem a true Pastoral, that the Subject of it is the action of a Shepherd, for in Hesiods  and Virgils Georgicks there are a great many things that belong to the employment of a Shepherd, yet none fancy they are Pastorals; from whence 'tis evident, that be∣side the matter, which we have defin'd to be the action of a Sheapard, there is a peculiar Form pro∣per to this kind of Poetry by which 'tis distin∣guish'd from all others. Of Poetry in General Socrates, as Plato tells us, would have Fable to be the Form: Aristotle Imita∣tion: I shall not dispute what difference there is between these two, but only inquire whether Imitation be the Form of Pastoral: 'Tis certain that Epick Poetry is differenc't from Tragick on∣ly
by the manner of imitation, for the latter imi∣tates by action, and the former by bare narration: But Pastoral is the imitation of a Pastoral action either by bare narration, as in Virgils Alexis, and Theocritus's 7th Idyllium, in which the Poet speaks all along in his own Person: or by action as in Virgil's Tityrus and the first of Theocritus, or by both mixt, as in the Second and Eleventh Idylli∣ums, in which the Poe partly speaks in his own Person, and partly makes, others speak, and I think the old Scholiast on heocritus took an hint from these when he says, that astoral is a mixture made up of all sorts, for 'tis Narrative, Drama∣tick, and mixt, and Aristotle, tho obscurely, seems to hnt in those words, In every one of the mentioned Arts there is Imitation, in some sim∣ple, in some mixt; now this latter being peculiar to Bucolicks makes its very form and Essence: and therefore Scaliger, in the 4th Chapter of his first Book of Poetry, reckons up three Species of Pastorals, the first hath but one Person, the second several, which sing alternately; the third is mixt of both the other: And the same observation is made by Heinsius in his Notes on Theocritus, for thus he very plainly to our purpose, the Character of Bucolicks is a mixture of all sorts of Characters, Dramatick, Narrative, or mixt: from all which 'tis very manifst that the manner of Imitation which is proper to Pastorals is the mixt: for in other kinds of Poetry 'tis one and simple, at least
not so manifold; as in Tragedy Action: in Epick Poetry Narration. Now I shall explain what sort of Fable; Manners, Thought, Expression, which four are necessary to consstitute every kind of Poetry, are proper to this sort. Concerning the Fable which Aristotle calls , I have but one thing to say: this, as the Philo∣sopher hints, as of all other sorts of Poetry, so of Pastoral is the very Soul: and therfore Socra∣tes in Plato says, that in those Verses which he had made there was nothing wanting but the Fable: therefore Pastorals as other kinds of Poetry must have their Fable, if they will be Poetry: Thus in Virgil's Silenus which contains the Stories of all∣most the whole Fabulous Age, two Shepherds whom Silenus had often promis'd a Song, and as often deceiv'd, seize upon him being drunk and asleep, and bind him with wreath'd Flowers; Aegle comes in and incourages the timorous youths, and stains his jolly red Fce with Black berries, Silenus laughs at their innocent contrivance, and desires to be unbound, and then with a pre∣mediated Song satisfies the Nymph's and Boys Curiosity; The incomparable Poet sings wonders, the Rocks rejoyce, the Vales eccho, and happy Eurotas as if Phoebus himself sang, hears all, and bids the Laurels that grow upon his Banks listen to, and learn the Song.
Happy Eurotas as he flow'd along Heard all, and bad the Laurels learn the Song. Thus every Eclogue or Idyllium must have its Fable, which must be the groundwork of the whole design, but it must not be perplext with sudden and unlookt for changes, as in Mari∣nus's Adonis: for that, tho the Fable be of a Shep∣herd, yet by reason of the strange Bombast under Plots, and wonderful occurences, cannot be ac∣counted Pastoral; for that it might be agreeable to the Person it treats of, it must be plain and simple, such as Sophocles's Ajax, in which there ls not so much as one change of Fortune. As for the Manners, let that precept, which Horace lays down in his Epistle to the Pisones, be principally observed. Let each be grac't with that which suits him best. For this, as 'tis a rule relateing to Poetry in ge∣neral, so it respect this kind also of which we are treating; and against this Tasso in his Amyn∣tas, Bonarellus in his Phyllis, Guarinus in his Pastor Fido, Marinus in his Idylliums, and most of the Italians grievously offend, for they make their Shepherds too polite, and elegant, and cloth them with all the neatness of the Town, and Comple∣ment of the Court, which tho it may seem very pretty, yet amongst good Criticks, let Veratus
say what he will in their excuse, it cannot be al∣lowed: For 'tis against Minturnus's Opinion, who in his second Book de Poetâ says thus: Mean Persons are brought in, those in Comedy indeed more polite, those in Pastorals more unelegant, as suppos'd to lead a rude life in Solitude; and Jason Denor a Doctor of Padua takes notice of the same as a very absurd Error: Aristotle heretofore for a like fault reprehended the Megarensians, who observ'd no Decorum in their Theater, but brought in mean persons with a Train fit for a King, and cloath'd a Cobler or Tinker in a Purple Robe: Invain doth Veratus in his Dispute against Jason Denor, to de∣fend those elaborately exquisite discourses, and notable sublime sentences of his Pastor Fido, bring some lofty Idylliums of Theocritus, for those are not acknowledged to be Pastoral; Theocritus and Virgil must be consulted in this matter, the former de∣signdly makes his Shepherds discourse in the Dorick i. e. the Rustick Dialect, sometimes scarce true Grammar; & the other studiously affects ignorance in the persons of his Shepherds, as Servius hath observ'd, and is evident in Meliboeus, who makes Oaxes to be a River in Crete when 'tis in Mesopo∣tamia: and both of them take this way that the Manners may the more exactly suit with the Per∣sons they represent, who of themselves are rude and unpolisht: And this proves that they scan∣dalously err, who make their Shepherds appear polite and elegant, nor can I imagine what Veratus
who makes so much ado about the polite man∣ners of the Arcadian Shepherds, would say to Polybius who tells us that the Arcadians by reason of the Mountainousness of the Country and hard∣ness of the weather, are very unsociable and austere. Now as too much neatness in Pastoral is not to be allow'd, so rusticity (I do not mean that which Plato, in his Third Book of a Common-wealth, mentions which is but a part of a down right honesty) but Clownish stupidity, such as Theophrastus, in his Character of a Rustick, de∣scribes; or that disagreeable unfashionable rough∣ness which Horace mentions in his Epistle to Lol∣lius, must not in my opinion be endur'd: On this side Mantuan errs extreamly, and is intoler∣ably absur'd, who makes Shepherds blockishly sottish, and insufferably rude: And a certain Interpreter blames Theocritus for the same thing, who in some mens opinion sometimes keeps too close to the Clown, and is rustick and uncouth; But this may be very well excus'd because the Age in which he sang was not as polite as now. But that every Part may be suitable to a Shep∣herd, we must consult unstain'd, uncorrupted Nature; so that the manners might not be too Clownish nor too Caurtly: And this mean may be easily observed if the manners of our Shep∣herds be represented according to the Genius of the golden Age, in which, if Guarinus may be be∣liev'd,
every man follow'd that employment: And Nannius in the Preface to his Comments on Virgils Bucolicks is of the same opinion, for he requires that the manners might represent the Golden Age: and this was the reason that Ʋirgil himself in his Pollio describes that Age, which he knew very well was proper to Bucolicks: For in the whole course of a Shepherds life there can be no form more excellent than that which was the practise of the Golden Age; And this may serve to moderate and temper the affections that must be exprest in this sort of Poetry, and sufficiently declare the whole Essence of it, which in short must be taken from the nature of a Shepherds life to which a Coutly dress is not agreeable. That the Thought may be commendable, it must be suitable to the manners; as those must be plain and pure that must be so too: nor must contain any, eep, exquisite, or elaborate fancies: And against this the Italians offend, who con∣tinually hunt after smart witty sayings, very fool∣ishly in my opinion; for in the Country, where all things should be full of plainess and simplicity who would paint or endeavor to be gawdy when such appearanes would be very disagreeable and offend? Pontanus in this matter hath said very well, The Thought must not be to exquisite and witty, the Comparisons obvious and common, such as the State of Persons and Things require: Yet tho too scru∣pulous a Curiosity in Ornament ought to be re∣jected,
yet lest the Thought be cold and flat, it must have some quickness of Passion, as in these. Cruel Alexis can't my Verses move? Hast thou no Pitty? I must dye for Love. And again, He neither Gods, nor yet my Verse regards. The Sense must not be long, copious, and continued, For Pastoral is weak, and not able to hold out; but of this more when I come to lay down rules for its Composure: But tho it ought to imitate Comedy in its common way of discourse, yet it must not chose old Comedy for its pattern, for that is too impudent, and licentiously abusive: Let it be free and modest, honest and ingenuous, and that will make it agreeable to the Golden Age. Let the Expression be plain and easy, but ele∣gant and neat, and the purest which the language will afford; Pontanus upon Virgils Buco∣licks gives the very same rule, In Bucolicks the Expression must be humble, nearer common discourse than otherwise, not very Spirituous and vivid, yet such as shows life and strength: Tis certain that Vir∣gil in his Bucolicks useth the same words which Tully did in the Forum or the Senate: and Tityrus beneath his shady Beech speaks as pure and good Latin as Augustus in his Palace, as Modicius in his Apology for Virgil hath excellently observ'd:
This rule, 'tis true; Theocritus hath not so strict∣ly follow'd, whose Rustick and Pastoral Muse, as Quintilian phraseth it, not only is affraid to appear in the Forum, but the City: and for the very same thing an Alexandrian flouts the Syracu∣cusian Weomen in the Fifteenth Idyllium of Theo∣critus, for when they, being then in the City, spoke the Dorick Dialect, the delicate Citizen could not endure it, and found fault with their distastful, as he thought, pronunciation: and his reflection was very smart. Like Pidgeons you have mouths from Ear to Ear. So intolerable did that broad way of pronun∣ciation, tho exactly fit for a Clowns discourse, seem to a Citizen: and hence Probus observes that 'twas much harder for the Latines to write Pastorals, than for the Greeks; because the Latines had not some Dialects peculiar to the Country, and others to the City, as the Greeks had; Besides the Latine Language, as Quintilian hath observ'd, is not capable of the neatness which is necessary to Bucolicks, no, that is the peculiar priviledge of the Greeks: We cannot, says he, be so low, they exceed us in subtlety, and in propriety they are at more certainty than We: and again, in pat and close Expressions we cannot reach the Greeks. And, if we believe Tully, Greek is much more fit for Ornament than Latin, for it hath much more of that neatness, end
and ravishing delightfulness, which Bucolicks necessarily require. Yet of Pastoral, with whose Nature we are not very well acquainted, what that Form is which the Greeks call the Character, is not very easy to determine; yet that we may come to some cer∣tainty, we must stick to our former observation, viz. that Pastoral belongs properly to the Golden Age: For as Tully in his Treatise de Oratore says, in all our disputes the subject is to be measur'd by the most perfect of that kind, and Syncsius in his Encomium on Baldness hints the very same, when he tells us that Poetry fashions its subject as Men imagine it should be, and not as really it is: : Now the Life of a Shepherd, that it might be rais'd to the highest perfection, is to be referr'd to the manners and age of the world whilst yet innocent, and such as the Fables have describ'd it: And as Simplicity was the principal vertue of that Age, so it ought to be the peculiar Grace, and as it were Character of Bucolicks: in which the Fable, Manners, Thought, and Expressi∣on ought to be full of the most innocent simplicity imaginable: for as Innocence in Life, so purity and simplicity in discourse was the Glory of that Age: So as gravity to Epicks, Sweetness to Lyr∣icks, Humor to Comedy, softness to Elegies, and smartness to Epigrams, so simplicity to Pastorals is proper; and one upon Theocritus says, that the Idea of his Bucolicks is in every part pure, and in all
that belongs to simplicity very happy: Such is this of Virgil, unwholsome to us Singers is the shade Of Juniper, 'tis an unwholsome shade: Than which in my opinion nothing can be more simply; nothing more rustically said; and this is the reason I suppose why Macrobius says that this kind of Poetry is creeping and upon mean subjects: and why too Virgils Tityrus lying under his shady Beech displeaseth some; Ex∣cellent Criticks indeed, whom I wish a little more sense, that they might not really be, what they would not seem to be, Ridiculous: Theocritus excells Virgil in this, of whom Modicius says, Theocritus deserves tht greatest commendation for his happy imitation of the simplicity of his Shepherds, Virgil hath mixt Allegories, and some other things which contain too much learning, and deepness of Thought for Persons of so mean a Quality: Yet here I must obviate their mistake who fancy that this sort of Poetry, because in it self low and simple, is the proper work of mean Wits, and not the most sublime and excellent perfections: For as I think there be can nothing more elegant than easy naked simplicity, so likewise nothing can require more strength of Wit, and greater pains; and he must be of a great and clear judgment, who at∣tempts Pastoral, and comes of with Honor: For there is no part of Poetry that requires more spirit, for if any part is not close and well com∣pacted the whole Fabrick will be ruin'd, and the
matter, in it self humble, must creep; unless it is held up by the strength and vigor of the Ex∣pression. Another qualification and excellence of Pasto∣ral is to imitate Timanthes's Art, of whom Pliny writes thus; Timanthes was very Ingenious, in all his peices more was to be understood than the Colours express'd, and tho his Art was very extraordinary yet his fancy exceeded it: In this Virgil is peculiarly happy, but others, especially raw unexperienced Writers, if they are to describe a Rainbow, or a River, pour out their whole stock, and are un∣able to contain: Now tis properly requisite to a Pastoral that there should be a great deal coucht in a few words, and every thing it says should be so short, and so close, as if its chiefest excel∣lence was to be spareing in Expression: such is that of Virgil; These Fields and Corn shall a Barbarian share? See the Effects of all our Civil War. How short is that? how concise? and yet how full of sense in the same Eclogue. I wonder'd why all thy complaints were made, Absent was Tityrus: And the like you may every where meet with, as Mopsus weds Nisa, what may'nt Lovers hope? and in the second Eclogue.
Whom dost thou fly ah frantick! oft the Woods Hold Gods, and Paris equal to the Gods. This Grace Virgil learn'd from Theocritus, all∣most all whose Periods; especially in the third Idyllium have no conjunction to connect them, that the sense might be more close, and the Affection vehement and strong: as in this Let all things change, let Pears the Firs adorn Now Daphnis dyes. And in the third Eclogue. But when she saw, how great was the surprize! &c. And any one may find a great many of the like in Theocritus and Virgil, if with a leisurely delight he nicely examines their delicate Composures: And this I account the greatest grace in Pastorals, which in my opinion those that write Pastorals do not sufficiently observe: Tis true Ours (the French) and the Italian language is to babling to endure it; This is the Rock on which those that write Pastorals in their Mother tongue are usually split, But the Italians are inevitably lost; who having store of Wit, a very subtle invention and flowing fancy, cannot contain; every thing that comes into their mind must be poured out, nor are they able to endure the least restraint: as is evident from Marinus's Idylliums, and a great many of that nation who have ventur'd on such composures: For unless there are many
and breakings off in the series of a Pastoral, it can neither be pleasing nor artificial: And in my Opinion Ʋirgil excells Theocritus in this, for Ʋir∣gil is neither so continued, nor so long as Theocri∣tus; who indulges too much the garrulity of his Greek; nay even in those things which he ex∣presseth he is more close, and more cautiously conceals that part which ought to be dissembled: And this I am sure is a most admirable part of Eloquence; as Tully in his Epistle to Atticus says, Tis rare to speak Eloquently, but more rare to be elo∣quently silent: And this unskillful Criticks are not acquainted with, and therefore are wont oftner to find fault with that which is not fitly exprest, than commend that which is prudently conceal'd: I could heap up a great many more things to this purpose, but I see no need of such a trouble, since no man can rationally doubt of the goodness of my Observation: Therefore, in short, let him that writes Pastorals think brevity, if it doth not obscure his sense, to be the greatest grace which he can attain. Now why Bucolicks should require such Brevity, and be so essentially sparing in Expression, I see no other reason but this; It loves Simplicity so much that it must be averse to that Pomp and Ostentation which Epick Poetry must show, for that must be copious and flowing, in every part smooth, and equal to it self: But Pastoral must dissemble, and hide even that which it would
show, like Damon's Galatea, who flies then when she most desires to be discovered. And to the Bushes flys, yet would be seen. And this doth not proceed from any malitious ill-natur'd Coyness, as some imagine, but from an ingenuous modesty and bashfulness, which usually accompanies, and is a proof of Simplicity: Tis very rare, says Pliny, to find a man so exquisitely skillful, as to be able to show those Features in a Picture which he hides; and I think it to be so difficult a task, that none but the most excellent Wits can attempt it with success: For small Wits usually abound with a multitude of words. The third Grace of Bucolicks is Neatness, which contains all the taking prettiness and sweetness of Expression, and whatsoever is call'd the Deli∣cacies of the more delightful and pleasing Muses: This the Rural Muses bestow'd on Virgil, as Hor∣ace in the tenth Satyr of his first Book says, And Virgils happy Muse in Eclogues plays, Soft and facetious; Which Fabius takes to signify the most taking neatness and most exquisite Elegance imaginable: For thus he explains this place, in which he a∣grees with Tully, who in his Third Book de Oratore, says, the Atticks are Facetious i. e. elegant: Tho the common Interpreters of these words are not of the same mind: But if by Facetious Horace had meant jesting, and such as is design'd to make men laugh, and apply'd that to Virgil, nothing
could have been more ridiculous; 'tis the design of Comedy to raise laughter, but Eclogue should only delight, and charm by its takeing prettiness: All ravishing Delicacies of Thought, all sweetness of Expression, all that Salt from which Venus, as the Poets Fable, rose; are so essential to this kind of Poetry, that it cannot endure any thing that is scurillous, malitiously biteing, or ridicu∣lous: There must be nothing in it but Hony, Milk, Roses, Violets, and the like sweetness, so that when you read you might think that you are in Adonis's Gardens, as the Greeks speak, i. e. in the most pleasant place imaginable: For since the subject of Eclogue must be mean and unsur∣prizing, unless it maintains purity and neatness of Expression, it cannot please. Therefore it must do as Tully says his friend Atticus did, who entertaining his acquaintance with Leeks and Onions, pleas'd them all very well, because he had them serv'd up in wicker Chargers, and clean Baskets; So let an Eclogue serve up its fruits and flowers with some, tho no costly imbellishment, such as may answer to the wicker Chargers, and Baskets; which may be provided at a cheap rate, and are agreeable to the Country: yet, (and this rule if you aim at ex∣act simplicity, can never be too nicely observ'd,) you must most carefully avoid all paint and gaw∣diness of Expression, and, (which of all sorts of Elegancies is the most difficult to be avoided)
you must take the greatest care that no scrupu∣lous trimness; or artificial finessess appear: For, as Quintilian teaches, in some cases diligence and care are most troublesomly perverse; and when things are most sweet they are next to loathsome and many times degenerate: Therefore as in Weomen a careless dress becomes some extreamly. Thus Pastoral, that it might not be uncomely, ought sometimes to be negligent, or the finess of its orna∣ments ought not to appear and lye open to every bodies view: so that it ought to affect a studied carelessness, and design'd negligence: And that this may be, all gawdiness of Dress, such as Paint and Curls, all artificial shining is to be despis'd, but in the mean time care must be taken that the Expression be bright and simply clean, not filthy and disgustful, but such as is varnisht with Wit and Fancy: Now to perfect this, Nature is chiefly to be lookt upon, (for nothing that is disagreeable to Nature can please) yet that will hardly prevail naked, by it self, and without the polishing of Art. Then there are three things in which, as in its parts, the whole Character of a Pastoral is con∣tain'd: Simplicity of Thought and expression: Shortness of Periods full of sense and spirit: and the Delicacy of a most elegant ravishing unaffected neatness. Next I will enquire into the Efficient, and then into the Final Cause of Pastorals.
Aristotle assigns two efficient Causes of Poetry, The natural desire of Imitation in Man whom he calls the most imitative Creature; and Plea∣sure consequent to that Imitation: Which indeed are the Remote Causes, but the Immediate are Art and Nature; Now according to the dif∣ferences of Genius's several Species of Poetry have been introduc'd: For as the Philosopher hath ob∣serv'd, Thus those that were lofty imitated great and Illustrious; those that were low spirited and groveling mean Actions: And every one, according to the va∣rious inclination of his Nature, follow'd this or that sort of Poetry: This the Philosopher expresly affirms, And Dio Chrysostomus says of Homer that he received from the Gods a Nature fit for all sorts of Verse: but this is an happiness which none partake but, as he in the same place inti∣mates, Godlike minds. Not to mention other kinds of Poetry, what particular Genius is requir'd to Pastoral I think, is evident from the foregoing Discourse, for as every part of it ought to be full of simple and in∣artificial neatness, so it requires a Wit naturally neat and pleasant, born to delight and ravish, which are the qualifications certainly of a great and most excellent Nature: For whatsoever in any kind is delicate and elegant, that is usually most excellent: And such a Genius that hath a sprightfulness of Nature, and is well instructed
by the rules of Art, is fit to attempt Pastorals. Of the end of Pastorals tis not so easy to give an account: For as to the end of Poetry in Gen∣eral: The Enemies of Poets run out into a large common place, and loudly tell us that Poe∣try is frivolous and unprofitable. Excel∣lent men! that love profit perchance, but have no regard for Honesty and Goodness; who do not know that all excellent Arts sprang from Poetry at first. Which what is honest, base, or just, or good, Better than Crantor, or Chrysippus show'd. For tis Poetry that like a chast unspotted Virgin, shews men the way, and the means to live happily, who afterward are deprav'd by the im∣modest precepts of vitiated and impudent Philo∣sophy. For every body knows, that the Epick sets before us the highest example of the Bravest man; the Tragedian regulates the Affections of the Mind; the Lyrick reforms Manners, or sings the Praises of Gods, and Heroes; so that there's no part of Poetry but hath its proper end, and profits. But grant all this true, Pastoral can make no such pretence: if you sing a Hero, you excite mens minds to imitate his Actions, and notable Exploits; but how can Bucolicks apply these or the like advantages to its self? He that reads
Heroick Poems, learns what is the vertue of a Hero▪ and wishes to be like him; but he that reads Pasto∣rals, neither learns how to feed sheep, nor wishes him∣self a Shepherd: And a great deal more to this purpose you may see in Modicius, as Pontanus cites him in his Notes on Virgil's Eclogues. But when tis the end of Comedy, as Jerom in his Epistle to Furia says, to know the Humors of Men, and to describe them; and Demea in Te∣rence intimates the same thing, To look on all mens Lives as in a Glass, And take from those Examples for our Own, so that our Humors and Conversations may be better'd, and improv'd; why may not Pastoral be allow'd the same Priviledge, and be admitted to regulate and improve a Shepherd's life by its Bucolicks? For since tis a product of the Gol∣den Age, it will shew the most innocent manners of the most ancient Simplicity, how plain and honest, and how free from all varnish, and de∣cet, to more degenerate, and worse times: And certainly for this tis commendable in its kind, since its design in drawing the image of a Coun∣try and Shepherd's life, is to teach Honesty, Candor, and Simplicity, which are the vertues of private men; as Epicks teach the highest For∣titude, and Prudence, and Conduct, which are the vertues of Generals, and Kings. And tis ne∣cessary
to Government, that as there is one kind of Poetry to instruct the Citizens, there should be another to fashion the manners of the Rusticks: which if Pastoral, as it does, did not do, yet would it not be altogether frivolous, and idle, since by its taking prettinesses it can delight, and please. It can scarce be imagin'd, how much the most flourishing times of the Roman Com∣mon-wealth, in which Virgil wrote, grew better and brisker by the use of Pastoral: with it were Augustus, Mecaenas, Asinius Pollio, Alphe∣nus Varus, Cornelius Gallus, the most admired Wits of that happy Age, wonderfully pleas'd; for whatever is sweet, and ravishing, is con∣tain'd in this sweetest kind of Poetry. But if we must slight every thing, from which no profit is to be hop'd, all pleasures of the Eye and Ear are presently to be laid aside; and those excel∣lent Arts, Musick, and Painting, with which the best men use to be delighted, are presently to be left off. Nor is it indeed credible, that so many excellent Wits, as have devoted them∣selves to Poetry, would ever have medled with it, if it had been so empty, idle, and frivolous, as some ridiculously morose imagine; who for∣sooth are better pleas'd with the severity of Phi∣losophy, and her harsh, deform'd impropriety of Expressions. But the judgments of such men are the most contemptible in the world; for when by Poetry mens minds are fashioned to generous
Humors, Kindness, and the like: those must needs be strangers to all those good qualites, who hate, or proclaim Poetry to be frivolous, and useless.
The Third PART. Rules for writing Pastorals. IN delivering Rules for writing Pastorals, I shall not point to the streams, which to look after argues a small creeping Genius, but lead you to the fountains. But first I must tell you, how difficult it is to write Pastorals, which ma∣ny seem not sufficiently to understand: For since its matter is low, and humble, it seems to have nothing that is troublesome, and difficult. But this is a great mistake, for, as Horace says of Co∣medy, It is by so much the more difficult, by how much the less pardonable are the mistakes committed in its composure: and the same is to be thought of every thing, whose end is to please, and delight. For whatsoever is con∣triv'd for pleasure, and not necessarily requir'd, unles it be exquisite, must be nauseous, and di∣stastful; as at a Supper, scraping Musick, thick Oyntment, or the like, because the Entertain∣ment might have been without all these: For the sweetest things, and most delicious, are most apt to satiate; for tho the sense may sometimes be pleas'd, yet it presently disgusts that which is
luscious, and, as Lucretius phraseth it, E'en in the midst and fury of the Joys, Some thing that's better riseth, and destroys. Beside, since Pastoral is of that nature, that it cannot endure too much negligence, nor too scrupulous diligence, it must be very difficult to to be compos'd, especially since the expression must be neat, but not too exquisite, and fine: It must have a simple native beauty, but not too mean: it must have all sorts of delicacies, and surprizing fancies, yet not be flowing, and luxu∣riant. And certainly, to hit all these excel∣lencies is difficult enough, since Wit, whose na∣ture it is to pour it self forth, must rather be re∣strain'd than indulg'd; and that force of the Mind, which of it self is so ready to run on, must be checkt, and bridled: Which cannot be easily perform'd by any, but those who have a very good Judgment, and practically skill'd in Arts, and Sciences: And lastly, a neat, and as it were a happy Wit; not that curious sort, I mean, which Petronius allows Horace, lest too much Art should take off the Beauty of the Simplicity. And therefore I would not have any one undertake this task, that is not very polite by Nature, and very much at leisure. For what is more hard than to be always in the Country, and yet never to be Clownish? to sing of mean, and trivial mat∣ters,
yet not trivially, and meanly? to pipe on a slender Reed, and yet keep the sound from being harsh, and squeaking? to make every thing sweet, yet never satiate?. And this I thought necessa∣ry to premise, in order to the better laying down of such Rules as I design. For the naked simpli∣city both of the Matter and Expression of a Pa∣storal, upon bare Contemplation, might seem ea∣sily to be hit, but upon trial 'twill be found a very hard task: Nor was the difficulty to be dissembled, lest Ignorance should betray some into a rash attempt. Now I must come to the very Rules; for as nothing excellent can be brought to perfection without Nature, (for Art unassisted by that, is vain, and ineffectual,) so there is no Nature so excellent, and happy, which by its own strength, and without Art and Ʋse can make any thing excellent, and great. But tis hard to give Rules for that, for which there have been none already given; for where there are no footsteps nor path to direct, I can∣not tell how any one can be certain of his way. Yet in this difficulty I will follow Aristotle's Ex∣ample, who being to lay down Rules concerning Epicks, propos'd Homer as a Pattern, from whom he deduc'd the whole Art: So I will gather from Theocritus and Virgil, those Fathers of Pa¦storal, what I shall deliver on this account. For all the Rules that are to be given of any Art, are to be given of it as excellent, and perfect, and
therefore ought to be taken from them in whom it is so. The first Rule shall be about the Matter, which is either the Action of a Shepherd, or con∣triv'd and fitted to the Genius of a Shepherd; for tho Pastoral is simple, and bashful, yet it will entertain lofty subjects, if it can be permitted to turn and fashion them to its own proper Cir∣cumstances, and Humor: which tho Theocritus hath never done, but kept close to pastoral sim∣plicity, yet Virgil hath happily attempted; of whom almost the same Character might be given, which Quintilian bestow'd n Stesichorus, who with his Harp bore up the most weighty subjects of Epick Poetry; for Virgil sang great and lofty things to his Oaten Reed, but yet suited to the Humor of a Shepherd, for every thing that is nor agreeable to that, cannot belong to Pastoral: of its own nature it cannot treat of lofty and great matters. Therefore let Pastaral be smooth and soft, not noisy and bombast; lest whilst it raiseth its voice, and opens its mouth, it meet with the same fate that, they say, an Italian Shepherd did, who having a very large mouth, and a very strong breath, brake his Pipe as often as he blow'd it. This is a great fault in one that writes Pastorals: for if his words are too sounding, or his sense too strong, he must be absurd, because indecently loud. And this is not the rule of an unskilful
impertinent Adviser, but rather of a very ex∣cellent Master in this Art; for Phoebus twitcht Virgil by the Ear, and warn'd him to forbear great Subjects: but if it ventures upon such, it may be allow'd to use some short Invocations, and, as Epicks do, modestly implore the assistance of a Muse. This Virgil doth in his Pollio, which is a Composure of an unusual loftiness: Sicilian Muse begin a loftier strain. So he invocates Arethusa, when Cornelius Gallus Proconsul of Aegypt and his Amours, matters above the common reach of Pastoral, are his Subject. One Labor more O Arethusa yield. Why he makes his application to Aretheusa is easy to conjecture, for she was a Nymph of Sicily, and so he might hope that she could inspire him with a Genius fit for Pastorals which first began in that Island, Thus in the seventh and eighth Eclogue, as the matter would bear, he invocates the Nymphs and Muses: And Theocritus does the same, Tell Goddess, you can tell. From whence 'tis evident that in Pastoral, tho it never pretends to any greatness, Invocations
may be allow'd: But whatever Subject it chooseth, it must take care to accommodate it to the Genius and Circumstances of a Shepherd. Concerning the Form, or mode of Imitation, I shall not repeat what I have already said, viz. that this is in it self mixt; for Pastoral is either Alternate, or hath but one Person, or is mixt of both: yet 'tis properly and chiefly Alternate, as is evident from that of Theocritus. Sing Rural strains, for as we march along We may delight each other with a Song. In which the Poet shows that alternate singing is proper to a Pastoral: But as for the Fable, 'tis requisite that it should be simple, lest in stead of Pastoral it put on the form of a Comedy, or Tra∣gedy if the Fable be great, or intricate: It must be One; this Aristotle thinks necessary in every Poem, and Horace lays down this general Rule, Be every Fable simple, and but one: For every Poem, that is not One, is imperfect, and this Ʋnity is to be taken from the Action: for if that is One, the Poem will be so too. Such is the Passion of Corydon in Virgil's second Eclogue, Meliboeus's Expostulation with Tityrus about his Fortune; Theocritus's Thyrsis, Cyclops, and Ama∣ryllis, of which perhaps in its proper place I may treat more largely.
Let the third Rule be concerning the Expres∣sion, which cannot be in this kind excellent un∣less borrow'd from Theocritus's Idylliums, or Vir∣gil's Eclogues; let it be chiefly simple, and in∣genuous: such is that of Theocritus, A Kid belongs to thee, and Kids are good, Or that in Virgil's seventh Eclogue, This Pail of Milk, these Cakes (Priapus) every year Expect; a little Garden is thy care: Thou'rt Marble now, but if more Land I hold, If my Flock thrive, thou shalt be made of Gold, than which I cannot imagine more simple, and more ingenuous expressions. To which may be added that out of his Palemon, And I love Phyllis, for her Charms excell; At my departure O what tears there fell! She sigh'd, Farewell Dear Youth, a long Farewell. Now, That I call an ingenuous Expression which is clear and smooth, that swells with no insolent words, or bold metaphors, but hath something familiar, and as it were obvious in its Composure, and not disguis'd by any study'd and affected, dress: All its Ornament must be like the Corn and fruits in the Country, easy to
be gotten, and ready at hand, not such as re∣quires Care, Labor, and Cost to be obtain'd: as Hermogenes on Theocritus observes; See how easie and unaffected this sounds, Pines murmurings, Goatherd, are a pleasing sound, and most of his expressions, not to say all, are of the same nature: for the ingenuous simplicity both of Thought and Expression is the natural Cha∣racteristick of Pastoral. In this Theocritus and Virgil are admirable, and excellent, the others despicable, and to be pittied: for they being en∣feebled by the meaness of their subject, either creep, or fall flat. Virgil keeps himself up by his choice and curious words, and tho his matter for the most part (and Pastoral requires it) is mean, yet his expressions never flag, as is evi∣dent from these lines in his Alexis: The glossy Plums I'le bring, and juicy Pear, Such as were once delightful to my Dear: I'le crop the Laurel, and the Myrtle tree, Confus'dly set, because their Sweets agree. For since the matter must be low, to avoid being abject, and despicable, you must borrow some light from the Expression; not such as is dazling, but pure, and lambent, such as may shine thro the whole matter, but never flash, and blind.
The words of such a Stile we are usually taught in our Nurses armes, but 'tis to be perfected and polished by length of time, frequent use, study, and diligent reading of the most approved Au∣thors: for Pastoral is apt to be slighted for the meaness of its Matter, unless it hath some additi∣onal Beauty, be pure, polisht, and so made plea∣sing, and attractive. Therefore never let any one, that designs to write Pastorals, corrupt himself with foreign manners; for if he hath once vitia∣ted the healthful habit, as I may say, of Expres∣sion, which Bucolicks necessarily require, 'tis im∣possible he should be fit for that task. Yet let him not affect pompous or dazling Expressions, for such belong to Epicks, or Tragedians Let his words sometimes tast of the Country, not that I mean, of which Volusius's Annals, upon which Catullus hath made that biting Epigram, are full; for though the Thought ought to be rustick, and such as is suitable to a Shepherd, yet it ought not to be Clownish, as is evident in Corydon, when he makes mention of his Goats. Young sportive Creatures, and of spotted hue, Which suckled twice a day, I keep for you: These Thestilis hath beg'd, and beg'd in vain, But now they're Hers, since You my Gifts disdain. For what can be more Rustical, than to design those Goats for Alexis, at that very time when
he believes Thestylis's winning importunity will be able to prevail? yet there is nothing Clow∣nish in the words. In short, Bucolicks should de∣serve that commendation which Tully gives Cras∣sus, of whose Orations he would say, that no∣thing could be more free from childish painting, and affected finery. So let the Expression in Pastoral be without gawdy trappings, and all those little fineries of Art, which are us'd to set off and var∣nish a discourse: But let an ingenuous Simpli∣city, and unaffected pleasing Neatness appear in every part; which yet will be flat, if 'tis drawn out to any length, if not close, short, and bro∣ken, as that in Virgil, He that loves Bavius Verses, hates not Thine: And in the same Eclogue, —It is not safe to drive too nigh, The Bank may fail, the Ram is hardly dry: And in Corydon, To learn this Art what won't Amyntas do? And in Theocritus much of the same nature may be seen; as in his other Pastoral Idylliums, so chiefly in his fifth. Thus Battus in the fourth Idyllium, complaining for the loss of Amaryllis,
Dear Nymph, dear as my Goats, you dy'd. And how soft and tender is that in the third Idyl∣lium, And she may look on me, she may be won, She may be kind, She is not perfect Stone, And in this concise, close way of Expression lies the chiefest Grace of Pastorals: for in my opi∣nion there's nothing in the whole Composi∣tion that can delight more than those frequent stops, and breakings off. Yet lest in these too it become dull and sluggish, it must be quickned by frequent lively touches of Concernment: such as that of the Goatherd in the third Idyl∣lium, —I see that I must die: Or Daphnis's despair, which Thyrsis sings in the first Idyllium, Ye Wolves, and Pards, and Mountain Bores adieu, The Herdsmen now must walk no more with You. How tender are the lines, and yet what passion they contain! And most of Virgil's are of this na∣ture, but there are likewise in him some touches of despairing Love, such as is this of Alphesiboeus, Nor have I any mind to be reliev'd:
Or that of Damon, I'le dy, yet tell my Love e'en whilst I dy: Or that of Corydon, He lov'd, but could not hope for Love again. For tho Pastoral doth not admit any violent pas∣sions, such as proceed from the greatest extremi∣ty, and usually accompany despair; yet because Despairing Love is not attended with those frightful and horrible consequences, but looks more like grief to be pittied, and a pleasing madness, than rage and fury, Eclogue is so far from refu∣sing, that it rather loves, and passionately re∣quires them. Therefore an unfortunate Shep∣herd may be brought in, complaining of his suc∣cesless Love to the Moon, Stars, or Rocks, or to the Woods, and purling Streams, mourning the unsupportable anger, the frowns and coyness of his proud Phyllis; singing at his Nymphs door, (which Plutarch reckons among the signs of Pas∣sion) or doing any of those fooleries, which are familiar to Lovers. Yet the Passion must not rise too high, as Polyphemus's, Galateas's mad Lo∣ver, of whom Theocritus divinely thus, as almost of every thing else: His was no common flame, nor could he move In the old Arts, and beaten paths of Love, No Flowers nor Fruits sent to oblige the Fair,
His was all Rage, and Madness: For all violent Perturbations are to be diligently avoided by Bucolicks, whose nature it is to be soft, and easie: For in small matters, and such must all the strifes and contentions of Shepherds be, to make a great deal of adoe, is as unseemly, as to put Hercules's Vizard and Buskins on an Infant, as Quintilian hath excellently observ'd. For since Eclogue is but weak, it seems not capa∣ble of those Commotions which belong to the Theater, and Pulpit; they must be soft, and gen∣tle, and all its Passion must seem to flow only, and not break out: as in Virgil's Gallus, Ah, far from home and me You wander o're The Alpine snows, the farthest Western shore, And frozen Rhine. When are we like to meet? Ah gently, gently, lest thy tender feet Sharp Ice may wound. To these he may sometimes joyn some short Interrogations made to inanimate Beings, for those spread a strange life and vigor thro the whole Composure. Thus in Daphnis, Did not You Streams, and Hazels, hear the Nymphs? Or give the very Trees, and Fountains sense, as in Tityrus, Thee (Tityrus) the Pines, and every Vale, The Fountains, Hills, and every Shrub did call: for by this the Concernment is express'd; and of the like nature is that of Thyrsis, in Virgil's Meli∣baeus,
When Phyllis eomes, my wood will all be green. And this sort of Expressions is frequent in Theocritus, and Virgil, and in these the delicacy of Pastoral is principally contain'd, as one of the old Interpreters of Theocritus hath observ'd on this line, in the eighth Idyllium, Ye Vales, and Streams, a race Divine: But let them be so, and so seldom us'd, that no∣thing appear vehement, and bold, for Boldness and Vehemence destroy the sweetness which peculiarly commends Bucolicks, and in those Composures a constant care to be soft and easie should be chief: For Pastoral bears some resem∣blance to Terence, of whom Tully, in that Poem which he writes to Libo, gives this Character, His words are soft, and each expression sweet. In mixing Passion in Pastorals, that rule of Lon∣ginus, in his golden Treatise , must be ob∣serv'd, Never use it, but when the matter requires it, and then too very sparingly. Concerning the Numbers, in which Pastoral should be written, this is my opinion; the He∣roick Measure, but not so strong and sounding as in Epicks, is to be chosen. Virgil and Theocritus have given us examples; for tho Theocritus hath in one Idyllium mixt other Numbers, yet that can be of no force against all the rest; and Virgil useth no Numbers but Heroick, from whence it may be inferr'd, that those are the fittest.
Pastoral may sometimes admit plain, but not long Narrations, such as Socrates in Plato requires in a Poet; for he chiefly approves those who use a plain Narration, and commends that above all other which is short, and fitly expresseth the na∣ture of the Thing. Some are of opinion that Bucolicks cannot endure Narrations, especially if they are very long, and imagine there are none in Virgil: but they have not been nice enough in their observations, for there are some, as that in Silenus: Young Chromis and Mnasylus chanct to stray, Where (sleeping in a Cave) Silenus lay, Whose constant Cups fly fuming to his brain, And always boyl in each extended vein: His trusty Flaggon, full of potent Juice, Was hanging by, worn out with Age, and Ʋse, &c. But because Narrations are so seldom to be found in Theocritus, and Virgil, I think they ought not to be often us'd; yet if the matter will bear it, I believe such as Socrates would have, may very fitly be made use of. The Composure will be more suitable to the Genius of a Shepherd, if now and then there are some short turns and digressions from the purpose: Such is that concerning Pasiphae in Si∣lenus, although tis almost too long; but we may give Viogil a little leave, who takes so little liber∣ty himself.
Concerning Descriptions I cannot tell what to lay don, for in this matter our Guides, Vir∣gil, and Theocritus▪ do not very well agree. For he in his first Idyllium makes such a long immode∣rate description of his Cup, that Criticks find fault with him, but no such description appears in all Virgil; for how sparing is he in his description of Melibaeus's Bechen Pot, the work of Divine Alcimedon? He doth it in five verses, Theocritus runs out into thirty, which certainly is an argu∣ment of a wit that is very much at leisure, and unable to moderate his force. That shortness which Virgil hath prudently made choice of, is in my opinion much better; for a Shepherd, who is naturally incurious, and unobserving, cannot think that tis his duty to be exact in particulars, and describe every thing with an accurate nice∣ness: yet Roncardus hath done it, a man of most correct judgment, and, in imitation of Theocritus, hath, considering the then poverty of our lan∣guage, admirably and largely describ'd his Cup; and Marinus in his Idylliums hath follow'd the same example. He never keeps within compass in his Descriptions, for which he is deservedly blam'd; let those who would be thought accu∣rate, and men of judgment, follow Virgil's pru∣dent moderation. Nor can the Others gain any advantage from Mschus's Europa, in which the description of the Basket is very long, for that Idyllium is not Pastoral: yet I confess, that some
descriptions of such trivial things, if not mi∣nutely accurate, may, if seldom us'd, be decent∣ly allow'd a place in the discourses of Shepherds. But tho you must be sparing in your Descrip∣tions, yet your Comparisons must be frequent, and the more often you use them, the better and more graceful will be the Composure; especially if taken from such things, as the Shepherds must be familiarly acquainted with: They are frequent in Theocritus, but so proper to the Country, that none but a Shepherd dare use them. Thus Me∣nalcas in the eighth Idyllium: Rough Storms to Trees, to Birds the treacherous Snare, Are frightful Evils; Springes to the Hare, Soft Virgins Love to Man, &c. And Damaetas in Virgil's Palaemon, Woolves Sheep destroy, Winds Trees when newly blown, Storms Corn, and me my Amaryllis frown. And that in the eighth Eclogue, As Clay grows hard, Wax soft in the same fire, So Daphnis does in one extream desire. And such Comparisons are very frequent in him, and very suitable to the Genius of a Shepherd: as likewise often repetitions, and doublings of some words: which, if they are luckily plac'd, have an unexpressible quaintness, and make the Numbers extream sweet, and the turns ravishing and delightful. An instance of this we have in Virgil's Meliboeus, Phyllis the Hazel loves; whilst Phyllis loves that Tree,
Myrtles than Hazels of less fame shall be. As for the Manners of your Shepherds, they must be such as theirs who liv'd in the Islands of the Happy or Golden Age: They must be can∣did, simple, and ingenuous; lovers of Goodness, and Justice, affable, and kind; strangers to all fraud, contrivance, and deceit; in their Love modest, and chast, not one suspitious word, no loose expression to be allowed: and in this part Theocritus is faulty, Virgil never; and this diffe∣rence perhaps is to be ascrib'd to their Ages, the times in which the latter liv'd being more polite, civil, and gentile. And therefore those who make wanton Love-stories the subject of Pasto∣rals, are in my opinion very unadvis'd; for all sort of lewdness or debauchery are directly con∣trary to the Innocence of the golden Age. There is another thing in which Theocritus is faulty, and that is making his Shepherds too sharp, and abusive to one another; Comatas and Lacon are ready to fight, and the railing between those two is as bitter as Billingsgate: Now certainly such Raillery cannot be suitable to those sedate times of the Happy Age. As for Sentences, if weighty, and Philosophi∣cal, common Sense tells us they are not fit for a Shepherd's mouth. Here Theocritus cannot be altogether excus'd, but Virgil deserves no repre∣hension But Proverbs justly challenge admission into Pastorals, nothing being more common in
the mouths of Countrymen than old Sayings. Thus much seem'd necessary to be premis'd out of RAPIN, for the direction and informa∣tion of the Reader. ERRATA, p. 13. l. 15. read the wind. p. 15. l. 16. read sight. p. 60. l. 4. read Shoes. p. 95. l. 17. read whilst all. p. 112. l. 9. read of my Love.
THEOCRITUS Idyllium I. Called Thyrsis, or . A Goatherd perswades the Shepherd Thrysis to bewail Daphnis who dy'd for Love, and gives him a large Cup and Goat for a reward. The Scene Sicily, about the River Himera. Thyrsis. GOatherd, that Pine-tree's boughs by yonder spring In pleasing murmurs mix, and sweetly sing: And Thou doest sweetly pipe, dear charming Swain, And well deserv'st the next reward to Pan: If He must have a Kid, a Goat's Thy due, If He a Goat, a Kid belongs to You:
And that's no mean reward, for Kids are good, And till they're milkt the flesh is dainty food. Goatherd. And, Sheapherd, sweeter Notes thy Pipe do fill Than murmuring springs that roul from yonder hill. When Muses claim a Sheep, a Lamb's thy due; When they a Lamb, thou shalt receive a Ewe. Thyrsis. And will You, by the Nymphs, grant one desire, Will you to neighbouring shady banks retire, And sit and pipe? come show thy wond'rous skill, I'le thank thee for't, and feed thy Goats the while. Goatherd. I dare not, faith I dare not pipe at Noon, Affraid of Pan, for when his Hunting's done, And He lyes down to sleep by purling streams, He's very touchy if we break his dreams: But Thyrsis (for you know fair Daphnis pains, And singst the best of all the tuneful Swains) Let's go and sit beneath you Myrtle boughs, Where stands Priapus, and the Nymphs repose, Where thy Hut's built and many an Acorn grows, And there if thou wilt pipe as sweet a Lay
As when you strove with The name of a Sheapherd. Crome and wan the day, Ile give Thee my best Goat, a lovely white; She suckles Two, yet fills Three Pails at night; Besides a Cup with sweetest Wax o're lay'd, A fine Two-handled Pot, and newly made: Still of the Tool it smells, it neatly shines, And round the brim a creeping Ivy twines With Crocus mixt; where Kids do seem to bronze, The Berryes crop, and wanton in the boughs: Within a Woman sits, a work divine, Thro envious vails her dazing Beauty's shine, And all around neat Woers offer Love, They strive, they quarrel, but they cannot move: Now smiling here, now there she casts her Eyes, And now to These, now Those her mind applyes: Whilst They, their Eyes swoln big with watchful pain, Still Love, still beg, but all, poor hearts, in vain. Near These a Fisher on white Rocks is set, He seems to gather up to cast his Net: He stands as labouring, and his Limbs appear All stretcht, and in his face mix hope and fear: The Nerves in's Neck are swoln, look firm and strong, All-tho He's old, and fit for one that's Young:
Next him ripe Grapes in blushing Clusters twine, And a fair Boy sits by to keep the Vine: On either side a Fox; one widely gapes, He eyes the Vines, and spoils the ripning Grapes: The other minds the Skrip, resolv'd to seize And rob the Fondling of his Bread and Cheese; Whilst He sets idly busy, neatly tyes Soft tender twigs, and frames a Net for Flyes; Pleas'd with his vain designes, a careless Boy, And more than Grapes or Skrip he minds the Toy. Round all a Creeping Woodbine doth aspire, A Some take , as relating to the Country, and would not have Calydon in the next line to be a proper Name. curious sight, i'me sure you must admire: 'Twas Calydons, but when he crost the Seas I bought it for a Goat, and Rammel Cheese: It never toucht my Lips, unsoild, and new, And this I freely will present to you, Heinsius reads , right no doubt, but it matters little. If you will sing how in the shady Grove Young Daphnis pin'd, and how He dy'd for Love. I am in Earnest, I will love Thee long, And surely mind the favour of thy song.
Thyrsis. Pan raise my voice, Pan move my learned tongue, Begin sweet Muse, begin the rural song: 'Tis Thyrsis song, Thyrsis from Aetna came, Some read, some . Sweet is his voice, and sounding as his fame: Where were you Nymphs? Where did the Nymphs reside, Where were you then when Daphnis pin'd and dy'd? On Pindus Top, or Tempe's open plain? Where careless Nymphs forgetful of the Swain? For not one Nymph by swift Asopus stood, Nor Aetnas Cliff, nor Acis sacred flood. Pan raise my voice, Pan move my learned tongue. Begin, sweet Muse, begin the Rural Song: For him the Woolves, the Pards, and Tigers moan'd, For Him with frightful grief the Lions groan'd: Pan raise my voice, Pan move my learned tongue, Begin sweet Muse, begin the Rural Song. A thousand Heifers, Bulls, and Cows, and Steers Lay round his feet, and melted into Tears: Pan raise my voice, Pan move my learned tongue, Begin sweet Muse, begin the Rural Song. First Hermes came, and with a gentle touch He rais'd, and and askt him whom he loved so much?
Pan raise my voice, Pan move my learned tongue, Begin sweet Muse, begin the Rural Song. The Plowmen, Heardsmen, and the Sheapherds came, And askt what ill? and what had rais'd the flame? Priapus came from neighbouring shades, and said, Poor Daphnis, why dost pine? why hang thy head? I follow Heinsius his Comment, which seems to be the best, and most agreeable to the Poets design. Mean while they Nymph doth o're the fields complain, She calls the Woods, and chides the perjured Swain; Pan raise my voice, Pan move my learned tongue, Begin sweet Muse, begin the Rural song. Ah Daphnis loose and wanton in thy Love! A Heardsman thought, thou dost a Goatherd prove! A Goatherd when he sees the Kids at rut Sits down, and grieves that He's not born a Goat; Thus when you see the Virgins dance, you grieve Because refus'd, and now disdain to live: Pan raise my voice, Pan move my learned tongue, Begin sweet Muse, begin the Rural Song. All this young Daphnis heard, but mute he sate, Indulg'd his grief, and hastened to his Fate: Pan raise my voice, Pan move my learned tongue, Begin sweet Muse, begin the Rural Song.
Then Venus came, a Smile her face possest, A faint half smile; fierce anger fill'd her breast: And said, well Daphnis you could fight with Love, With what success the haughty Sheapherd strove! You scorn'd his Bow, and you his Darts Disgrac't; But Daphnis was not Love too strong at last? Pan raise my voice, Pan move my learned tongue, Begin sweet Muse, begin the Rural Song. And thus the Youth reply'd, disdainful foe, Ah cruel Venus, cursed by all below? The Sun hath told, I fall, but still shall prove Midst shades below a deadly plague to Love: Pan raise my voice, Pan move my learned tongue, Begin sweet Muse, begin the Rural Song: Go, go to Ida, there, as story goes, Are Scenes of Pleasure, there Anchises does: — Go Venus, there are shades, and Cypress bowers, And labouring Bees buz o're the riseing flowers: Pan raise my voice, Pan move my learned tongue, Begin sweet Muse, begin the rural song: There lives Adonis, there the wondrous fair, There feeds his Sheep, shoots Beasts, and hunts the Hare:This reading seems best, tho against the opinion of several of the Criticks.
Pan raise my voice, Pan move my learned tongue, Begin sweet Muse, begin the rural song: Go now stout Diomed, go soon pursue, Go nose him now, and boast, my Arts o'rethrew Young Daphnis, fight, for I'me a match for you: Pan raise my voice, Pan move my learned tongue, Begin sweet Muse, begin the rural song: Ye Woolves, ye Lions, and ye Bores adieu, For Daphnis walks no more in Woods with you; Adieu fair Arethuse, fair streams that swell Thro Thymbrian plains, ye silver streams farewel: Pan raise my voice, Pan move my learned tongue, Begin sweet Muse, begin the rural song: That Daphnis I that here my Oxen fed, That here my Bulls and Cows to water led: Pan raise my voice, Pan move my learned tongue, Begin sweet Muse, begin the rural song: Pan, Pan, where e're you keep your Sylvan court Whether on Lyce's tops the Satyrs sport, Or wanton o're the high Menalian hill; We beg Thee visit Sicily's fair Isle, Leave Helick's Cliff, from Licon's Tomb remove, A Tomb to be admir'd by Gods above,
Pan raise my voice, Pan move my learned tongue, Begin sweet Muse, begin the rural song: Come mighty King, come Pan, and take my Pipe Well joyn'd with Wax, and sitted to my Lip, For now 'tis useless grown, Love stops my Breath, I cannot Pipe, but must be mute in death: Pan raise my voice, Pan move my learned tongue, Begin sweet Muse, begin the rural song: On every Shrub and Thorn let Lillies smile, Let Privet berries stain the Daffadil; Let all things change, the Pine tree's lofty head Let mellow Pears adorn, since Daphni's dead, Let Deer pursue the Dogs, on ever bush Let Schreech-Owls sit, and chatter with the Thrush: Pan raise my voice no more, Pan stop my tongue, End Muses, end, end Muse, the rural song: This said He dy'd, fair Venus rub'd the Swain, And idly strove to bring him back again; For cruel Fate had broken every thread And o're the Stygian Lake young Daphni fled: The cruel waves enclos'd the lovely Boy The Nymphs delight, and Muses chiefest joy:
Pan raise my voice no more, Pan stop my tongue, End Muses, end, end Muse the rural song Give me the Cup the promis'd Goat produce, That I may milk, and offer to my Muse; Hail, Muses, hail, all hail ye sacred Nine, I'le still improve, and make my Song divine. Goat-heard, Dear Thyrsis! O! may Hony drops distil, And Hony Combs, thy mouth, dear Sheaperd, fill! It fits thy sweetness, youth, for Thyrsis sings More sweet than Insects bred in flowry springs: Here take the Cup, view it, how rare the smell! As sweet as washt in the Springs fragrant well: Come The name of the Goat. Browning, milk her; Kids, forbear to skip, The Goat is wanton, Kids, and he may leap.
Idyllium II. Or the Inchantment. Samoetha being forsaken by Delphis resolves to try the force of Charms to recover his affection; applyes her∣self to the Moon as a powerful Goddess in both those matters, and after she hath sent away her maid, tells the story of her misfortune. To GEORGE PITT Jun. Esquire. MAid, where's my Lawrel? Oh my rageing Soul! Maid, where's the Potion? fill the Bason full, And crown the narrow brim with Purple wool: That I might charm my false, my perjur'd Swain, And force him back into my arms again: For Cruel he these Twelve long days hath fled, And knows not whether I'me alive or dead: He hath not broke my Doors these Twelve long days, Ah me! perhaps his varying Love decays, Or else he dotes upon another face. I'le run to morrow to the Fencing house, And ask him what he means to use me thus: But now I'le charm him, Moon, shine brignt and clear, To thee I will direct my secret prayer;
To Thee, and Hecate, whom Dogs do dread When stain'd with gore, she stalks amidst the dead: Hail frightful Hecate, assist me still Make mine as great as fam'd Medea's skill: A Bird sacred to Venus much used in Love Charms Jynx restore my false, my perjur'd Swain And force him back into my Arms again. First burn the Flowr, then strew the  other on, Strew it. How? where's your sense and duty gone? Base Thestylis! and am I so forlorn, And grown so low that I'me become your scorn! But strew the  not  Salt, and say in angry tones I scatter Delphids, perjur'd Delphids bones. Jynx restore my false, my perjur'd Swain And force him back into my Arms again. First Delphid injur'd me, he rais'd my flame, And now I burn this Bough in Delphids name: As this doth blaze, and break away in fume, How soon it takes! let Delphids Flesh consume.
Jynx restore my false, my perjur'd Swain, And force him back into my Arms again. As this devoted Wax melts ore the Fire Let Mindian Delphy melt in warm desire, And, Venus, as I whirl this brazen bowl, Before my doors let perjur'd Delphid rowl: Jynx restore my false, my perjur'd Swain, And force him back into my Arms again. Now now I strow the Flowr, Moon you can bow E'en Rhadamanth, and all that's fierce below, Hark Thestilis our Dogs begin to howl, The Goddess comes, go beat the brazen bowl. Jynx restore my false, m perjur'd Swain, And force him back into my Arms again. The Sea grows smooth, and ease becalms my Wind, But griefs still rage, and toss my troubled mind: I burn for Him, for Him whose Arts betraid And wrought my shame, for I'me no more a maid. Jynx restore my false, my perjur'd Swain, And force him back into my arms again. Thrice, thrice I pour, and thrice repeat my charms,
What ever Boy or Maid now fills his arms, Let dark oblivion spread o're Delphids mind, As dark as that, that once did The story f Theseus and Ariadne is known. Theseus blind When he at Naxos left his Love behind. Hippomanes a Plant Arcadia bears, This makes Steeds mad, and this excites the Mares, And Oh that I could see my Delphid come From th' Oyly Feneing House so raveing home. Jynx restore my false, my perjur'd Swain, And force him back into my Arms again. This piece from dear false Delphids garment torn I tear again, and am resolv'd to burn, Ah cruel Love! ah most relentless God, Why like a Leech still eager on his food, Dost wound my heart, and suck out all my blood? Jynx restore my false, my perjur'd Swain, And force him back into my Ams again. A Lizzard squeez'd shall make a powerful bowl To morrow, strong to tame his stubborn Soul: Now take these Poysons, I'le procure thee more, And strew them at the Threshold of his door,
That door where violent Love hath fixt my mind, Tho he regards not; Cruel and Ʋnkind! Strew them, and spitting say in angry tones, I scatter Delphids, perjur'd Delphids bones. Jynx restore my false, my perjur'd Swain, And force him back into my arms again. Now I'me alone shall I lament my state? But where shall I begin? what wrought my Fate? Anaxo Eubul's daughter neatly drest Begd me to go and see Diana's feast, For fame had tod, Wild beasts must there be shown In solem pomp, a Lioness was one. Tell sacred Moon what first did raise thy flame, And whence my Pain, and whence my Passion came. With Hers my Nurse, did all her vows unite, And bad me go, for 'twould be worth my ight, So forc't, and finely drest, in Pomp and State I went, attended by an evil Fate. Tell Sacred Moon what first did raise my flame And whence my Pain, and whence my Passion came. Near Lyco's House break thro the yielding throng, I saw my Delphis, vigorous, stout, and young,
A Golden Down spread o re his youthful Chin, His breast, bright Moon, was brighter far than thine: For spread with glorious Oyl he lately came From noble Fenceing, and from winning Fame: Tell sacred Moon what first did raise my flame And whence my Pain, and whence my Passion came. Oh when I saw, how did the sight surprize! My Soul took Fire, and sparkeld thro my eyes, My Color chang'd, regardless of the show I hasted home, but came I know not how; A burning feavour seiz'd my thoughtful head, And Twelve long days and nights I kept my bed, Tell sacred Moon what first did raise my flame, And whence my Pain, and whenc my Passion came My Rosy Color d'yd into a Pale, My Eyes grew dim, my hair began to fall, Meer Skin and Bones, I liv'd, I breath'd and prayd, And sought to every Cunning man for aid: All charms were try'd, and various Figures cast, But ah no help, and time did swiftly wast: Tell sacred Moon what first did raise my flame, And whence my Pain, and whence my passion came.
At last I told my Maid the naked truth, Go Thestilis, have pitty on my youth; Go find some cure to ease my rageing smart; Young Delphid is the Tyrant of my Heart: Go to the Fenceing House, ther's his delight, For there he walks, and there he loves to sit. Tell sacred Moon what first did raise my flame, And whence my Pain, and whence my Passion came. And if alone, give him a gentle Nod, And softly tell him that Samaetha wou'd (Speak, speak, tho modest fear doth strike thee dumb) Enjoy him here, and beg him he would come. She went, she found, and told him what I said, He Gladly heard, and eagerly obey'd. But when he came, how great was the surprize Chills shook my Soul, and I grew cold as Ice: Tell sacred Moon what first did raise my flame, And whence my Pain, and whence my Passion came. Cold sweat slow'd down my Cheeks like driving rain, And when I strove to speak, I strove in vain; No noise would come, not such as lulld in rest Young Infants murmur o're their mothers breast: No sign of Life did thro my Limbs appear,
But I grew stiff, stiff as this Gold I wear: Tell sacred Moon what first did raise my flame, And whence my Pain, and whence my Passion came. Then cruel he sate down, he prest my bed, His eyes were fixt, and as he sate he said, Samoetha you do me as far surpass, As I Philistus when we ran the race; Too quick for me in this your kind intent, You did my hast, tho not my wish prevent. Tell sacred Moon what first did raise my flame, And whence my Pain, and whence my Passion came. For I had come at night, by Love tis true, Unsent for I had come to wait on you: With Apples in my Lap, with This was the Custom to wait on their beloved with these Love Toys, as Apples, and Garlands to perform their Cere∣mony called , His was to be of Poplar as befiting  Wrestler, being a Tree sacred to Hercules. Poplar crown'd With Ivy twin'd, and Ribbonds neatly bound: Tell sacred Moon what first did raise my flame, And whence my Pain, and whence my Passion came. Where if admitted t' had been kindly done For I am thought the beauty of the Town;
And tho perhaps I wisht for greater bliss I would have been contented with a kiss; But if deny'd, or flam'd with dull delay Streight fire and force had come, and broke a way: Tell sacred Moon what first did raise my flame, And whence my Pain, and whence my Passion came. But now to Venus my first thanks are due, The next Samoetha must be paid to you, To you Samoetha, you, whose gentle hand From raging fires secur'd the flaming brand, And saved poor half-burnt Me, for Love doth raise Fires fierce as those that in hot Aetna blaze; Tell sacred Moon what first did raise my flame, And whence my Pain, and whence my Passion came. Young tender Maids to unknown Madness drives, And from warm Husbands Arms it forces Wives: Thus He, and heedless I believ'd too soon, He prest My hand in His, and laid me down On the soft bed, when streight lock't Arm in Arm In strickt embraces both grew gently warm; Our breath was hot and short, we panting lay, We look't, we murmur'd, and we dy'd away: Our Cheeks did glow, and fainting vertue strove,
At last it yielded to the force of Love: But what need all this talk? bright sacred Moon, Both were well pleas'd, and some strange thing was done: And ever since we lov'd, and liv'd at ease, No sullen Minutes broke our Happiness; Till oon this morning e're the Sun could rise, And drive his Charriot thro the yielding Skies To fetch the Rosy Morn from waves below, I heard the fatal news, and knew my woe: My Maids own Mother, she that lives hard by An Honest Woman, and she scorns to ly; She came and askt me, is your Delphid kind? And have you firm posession of his Mind? For I am sure, but whether Maid or Boy I cannot tell, he courts another joy: For he drinks Healths, and when those Healths are past, He must be gone, and goes away in hast: Besides with Garlands all his Rooms are drest, And he prepares, as for a Marriage Feast; This as as she walkt last night she chanc't to view, And told it me, and oh, I fear 'tis true! For He was wont to come twice, thrice a day, He saw me still as he return'd from play; But now since he was here twelve nights are past, Am I forgotten? am I left at last?
Whilst perjur'd he for other Beauty burns, My Love I'me sure deserv'd more kind returns, But now I'le Charm, but if he scorns me still I'le force him down to Hell, by Fate, I will: Such powerful drugs a Witch did once impart She taught me such strange Charms, such force of Art: But now farewel bright Moon, turn lovely Moon To Waves below, and drive thy Charriot down, Go lovely Moon, and wake the sleepy Morn: I'le bear my trouble still, as I have born; Farewel, and you attending Stars that wheel Round Nights black Axle-tree, bright Stars, farewel.
Idyllium III. The Goatherd. He repines at the coyness of his Mistriss and ends in despair. I go to Phyllis, and on yonder Rock My Goats are fed, and Tityrus keeps my flock; Dear Tityrus watch, and see the Goats be fed, To morning Pastures, Evening Waters led, But 'ware the Lybian Ridgling's butting head: Ah lovely Phyllis why so wondrous coy! Why wo'nt you take me to the promis'd joy? Why wo'nt you meet me now in yonder Grove Lean on my Breast, and Kiss, and call me Love? Dost hate me, Phyllis? do's my Nose when near Seem hookt, too long my Beard, and rough my hair? Am I deform'd? displeasing to thy Eye! Grown ugly now! I see that I must dye: Ten Apples I have sent, you show'd the Tree, Ten more to morrow; all I pluck for Thee; Could I enjoy what e're my wish can crave, I'de turn that Bee that flies into thy Cave,
There softly thro thy shady Garland creep, And steal a Kiss when you are fast asleep; I know what Love is now, a cruel God, A Tygress bore, and nurst him in a Wood; A cruel God, he shoots thro every vein, And fires my bones, have pitty on my pain: Dear, black ey'd sweet, all stone, ah lovely face, Be kind again, and grant one kind embrace; Do, clasp thy humble Swain, and grant one Kiss, E'en empty Kisses have a secret bliss. I rave, and I shall tear the Crowns I made, Of Fragrant Parsly twin'd, to grace your head; Ah me! unhappy me! what pains I bear? Ah me! undone! yet you refuse to hear: My Jerkin's off, I'le leap into the flood From you high Rock, where Olpis often stood To snare his Trouts; and tho I do not drown 'Twill please Thee Phyllis, sure, to hear 'twas done: All this I knew: when I design'd to prove Whether I should be happy in my Love, I prest the Long-live, but invain did press, It gave no lucky sound of good success: To Agrio too I made the same demand, A cunning Woman she, I crost her hand; She turn'd the Sieve and Sheers, and told me true,
That I should love, but not be lov'd by you: I have a pretty Goat, a lovely white, She bears two Kids, yet fills three Pails at night, This tawny Bess hath beg'd, and beg'd in vain, But now 'tis hers since you my gifts disdain: My right Eye itches now, and shall I see My Love? I'le sit and pipe by yonder tree, And she may look on me, she may be won, She may be kind, she is not perfect Stone: When young Hippomanes sought the Maids embrace, He took the Golden fruit, and ran the race. But when she view'd, how strong was the surprize! Her Soul took Fire, and sparkled thro her Eyes, How did her passions, how her fury move! How soon she leapt into the deepest Love! From Aetna's top to Pyle Melampus drove His tender Flock, and met a noble Love: Wise Alphisb's mother opened all her charms To Bias Eyes, and wanton'd in his Arms: Adonis liv'd a Swain, and yet the Boy Fir'd Venus breast, She prov'd so mad for joy That ir her lap she warm'd his dying Head, Kisst his cold Lips, and would not think him dead: Tho young Endymion fed ten Thousand Sheep, I envy nothing but his lasting sleep:
I envy Jason's happy dreams, my Dear, They tasted joys which no prophane must hear, Joys too divine for an unhallow'd Ear: Ah me my head! but who regards my pain! l'le fall, despair, and never pipe again: A prey to Woolvs, 'twill be a dainty feast, And sweeter far than Hony to thy tast.
Idyllium IV. Battus and Corydon in a pastoral way discourse of several things. To His good friend Mr. E. Lyde of Horspath. B. WHose Herds? Philonda's? tell whose Herds they are, C. Aegon's, for Aegon gave them to my care, B. Do'nt you play false, and sometimes milk a Cow, By stealth? C. No, my old Master eyes me so, Gives the Calves suck, and watches what I do: B. But where is Aegon? where's the Herdsman gone? C. What ha'nt you heard? for sure the story's known, B. Not I, I live out of the road of Fame: C. Milo hath him drawn to th' Olympian game: B. And what will He do there, rude artless Swain? C. But yet his strength is fam'd o're all the plain; As big as Hercules, as stout and strong, B. More known for brutal force, than fam'd for Song: C. He nere plaid Cudgels but he broak a head, Stout Castor's match I'me sure my mother said:
A score of For diet and exercise before he Wrestled. Sheep he carried, and a Spade, B. What will not Milo do, that can perswade This Clown to leave his wealth, and court a shade? C. His Cows here want him, and mourn o're the plain: B. Poor Beasts! and how unhappy in a Swain! C. Poor beasts! they will not eat, but idlely low; B. Ah careless Herdsman! look on yonder Cow, Poor Beast I pitty her, how gastly thin! Her bones are creeping thro the famisht skin: See you may tell her Ribs, her entrails view: What, like an Insect, doth she feed on Dew? C. No; and I hope to see her shortly prove, She sometimes doth in Latym's shady Grove And sometimes o're Asaru's pastures stray, And there I feed her at a rack of Hay: B. Look that red Bull is Iean, meer skin and bone, May the Lampridoe, when they would attone Great Juno's anger; meet with such a one; Lean be his aged flesh, corrupt his blood, For they deserv't, ah tis a cursed brood:
C. And yet I feed him, by the Springs He goes, Or in Neoetha's plains, where plenty flows, The Gilcup Cowslip, and the Dazy grows: B. Ah wretched Aegon here thy Oxen dye Whilst you pursue a foolish Victory: Thy best new Pipe is spoyl'd, tis mouldy grown, Alas it must be spoyl'd now Thou art gone: C. No fear of that, for when He went away He gave it me, and, Battus, I can play: I sing smooth Phyrrhus songs, I gain renown To Croto, Zacynth is a pretty Town, Lacinius rises proudly to the East, There Aegon once eat eighty Cakes at least: There did I see him whilst He bravely strove, Draw down the Bull, and give him to his love, To Amaryllis, all with joy were fill'd The Women shouted, and the Herdsman smil'd: B. Ah lovely Amaryllis, you alone Do still possess my mind, tho dead and gone; Dear as my Goats you dy'd, and left me here Ah me how hard's my Fate, and how severe! C. Cheer up, dear Battus, better days may come To morrow, chance, may bring a milder doom:
Th alive may hope, the dead are hopeless, lost; Jove sometimes smiles, and sometimes frowns in frost: B. I do cheer up, but drive your Heifers down They spoil my Olives, Browning, Hist, begone: C. Hah, Colly, to the bank: not stir by Jove? If I come to ye, In faith, I'le make ye move: See now she runs this way; a cursed Cow! Had I my Paddle thou shouldst feel me now: B. Look here for God's sake, oh it pricks, it pricks! I've caught a thorn, oh me how deep it sticks! Pray pull it out, dost see it? look 'tis there; Pox take the Cow, I'me sure 'twas long of her: C. I have it out, 'twas this, come, all is well, B. How small the wound, yet what vast Courage fell! C. Ne're walk ore mountains, Swain, without your Shoe, For there are thorns, and there sharp prickles grow: B. But Swain, does thy old Master still pursue His old Sweet-heart, or doth he court a new; C. His old one still, poor wretch! in yonder grove I trac'd, and found them in a Scene of Love: B. Oh brave old lusty Goat! thy race may vye With small shank't Pan's, or Satyr's Leachery!
Idyllium V. The Goatherd Comatas, and Herdsman Laco contend in Singing, They lay a Wager, and chuse Morso Judge: The victory is determin'd on the Goatherd's side. To Owen Salisbury Esquire. C. FLY Goats fly Laco, fly, and safely feed; He stole my skin last night, dear Goats take heed: L. Lambs do'nt you fly the springs? Lambs don't you fear, When He that lately stole my Pipe's so near? C. Thy Pipe! what Pipe hadst Thou, thou slavish lout, Couldst Thou and Corydon do ought but toot On Oaten straws, to please the foolish rout? L. The Pipe that Lycon gave, free haughty fool; But pray what skin was that that Laco stole? What skin Comatas? where couldst thou have one? Thy master wants a skin to sleep upon: C. That spotted skin which, when He kill'd a Goat To th' Nymphs, Dick gave; which you, you envious Sot, Then griev'd to see; and now by knavish theft Hast rob'd me of, 'twas all that I had left: L. By Pan not Laco, not Calaithis Son Did steal thy Pipe, or know by whom 'twas done;
If this be'nt true, may I grow frantick, leap From yonder Rocks, and sink into the Deep: C. And by the Fountain Nymphs, (those Nymphs I find My constant friends, still generous and kind) Comatas did not steal thy Pipe, believe That this is true, and I thy fault forgive: L. If I believe Thee may I bear the pains That Daphnis bore, but since you boast your strains, Come stake a Goat, I'le pipe when e're you will, Till you grow weary, and confess my skill: C. A Sow, Minerva: I'me content to lay A Kid, you stake a Lamb, and then let's play: L. And how's that equal? oh you crafty fool, Pray who Goats hair did ever shoer for Wool? C. He that's as sure as you are to excel, (Tho Wasps with Grasshoppers may strive as well) But since you think a Kid no equal stake, Look there's a full-grown Goat, you shan't draw back: L. Soft, soft, good Sir; and let us hence remove, There's better singing in that shady Grove; For there cold water flows, there Herbs do spring, And there are grassy beds, and locusts sing: C. I'me not in hast, but yet I'me vext to see,
That Thou shouldst dare at last to strive with me; With me who when a Boy did teach thee strains, Are these the kind returns for all my pains? But breed a Woolf, or an ungrateful Bear, And He'l devour Thee for thy former care: L. Pray when did I, you envious railing Sot, E're learn, or hear from you one graceful Note? But pray come hither, here are beds of grass And here wee'l sing, 'tis a convenient place: C. I'le not go thither, here are Cypress bowers, Here labouring Bees buz o're the riseing flowers; Here two cold streams, and here a fountain flows, And pratling Birds do murmur thro the boughs: Thy shade's not half so good, here Pines do grow, Rear lofty heads, and scatter Nuts below: L. No rather go with me, and every step Shall tread on Lamb skins Wool more soft than Sleep; In thine are Goat skins spread of gastly hue, They smell as rank, nay allmost worse than you: One bowl of Milk I to the Nymphs will crown, And one of Oyl, if that will draw Thee on: C. No, go with me, for mine are fairer bowers; There Thou shalt tread upon the sweetest flowers: Besides o're all I'le spread a lovely Skin,
'Tis ten times softer, and as sweet as thine: Eight Bowls of Milk to Pan I'le freely Crown, Of Hony eight, if that will draw Thee on: L. Come then I'le go, the doubt at last is clear'd Your skins, your shades shall be for once preferr'd; But who shall judge, and who shall hear us play? I wish the Herdsman Licop came this way: C. I don't care much for him, but here's as good Morson the Keeper of our Master's Wood, He makes your Faggots, and if you'l consent Wee'l call him, He shall be our Judge, L. content: C. Then call him: L. Friend, come here, we now contest: Which tunes the Rural Pipe, which Sings the best, Whose Art is greatest must be judg'd by Thee, Judge right, and neither favor him, nor me: C. No, Morson, let desert thy judgement guide, Be faire to both, and lean to neither side; This flock is Thurius flock, and these forsooth Eumara's Goats; that you may know us both: L. Did any ask to whom These flocks belong, To me, or Thurius? oh Thou hast a Tongue! C. What ere I say, Ime sure, is nought but Truth, I scorn to boast; But you've a railing mouth:
L. Sing, sing, but let thy friend return again, Alive; Comatas! Oh how sweet a Swain! C. Me more than Daphnis all the Muses love, Two Kids I lately offer'd in a Grove: L. And me Apollo loves, a wanton Steer I feed to offer, for his feast is near: C. I milk two Goats; A maid in yonder Plain: Lookt on, and sigh'd, dost milk thy self, poor Swain! L. Ha, Laco, hah, full twenty fats can fill With Cheese, and hath a lovely youth at will: C. The fair Calistris, as my Goats I drove, With Apples pelts me, and still murmurs Love: L. And me smooth Cratid, when He meets me, fires; I burn, I rage, and am all wild desires: C. Who with the Rose, whose flower the bush adorns, Compares the meaner beauties of the Thorns? L. And who will Sloes with Damzen Plums compare? For those are black, and these are lovely fair: C. I'le give my Dear a Dove, in yonder woods I'le climb, and take her down, for there she broods: L. A fleece to make a Coat, when first I sheer Black Rams, I will present unto my Dear: C. Goats from the Olives, come and feed below, By this declineing bank; there Myrtles grow:
L. Ho, Sharp-horn, Browning, leave those hurtful weeds' And come and graze this way, where Colly feeds: C. I have a Cypress Pail, and Cup; 'tis new, Well wrought, and this, my Love, I keep for you: L. I have a sturdy Spock, it Woolvs will seize, With this my Boy may hunt what Beasts He please: C. You Locusts, you, that o're my fences throng, Hurt not my Vines too much, for they are young: L. See Grasshoppers, see how I nearly touch The Goatherd, Reapers you provoke as much: C. I hate the brush tail'd Fox, He comes at night, Eats Myco's Vines; and then prepares for flight: L. I hate the Beetles, for they always prey On my Philonda's Figgs; then whisk away: C. And do'nt you mind, when I—you know the trick—, You wanton'd, laght, and clung to yonder stick: L. Not that: but when your Master us'd to bind And lash you there, I know; for that I mind: C. He's angry, Morson: art Thou frantick Swain? Go gather Scilla, that will purge thy brain: L. Morson, I nettle him, I vex him more, Swain thou art Mad, go gather Helebore: C. With milk Himera, and let Crathis slow With purple Wine; let Figgs on Brambles grow: L. Let Sybaris roul Hony, every Urn
My Servant dips with flowing Combs return: C. My Goats eat Thyme, on Figgs they freely brouze, They walk on Flaggs, and ly on tender Boughs: L. My Sheep eat Parsly, thro the fields they stray, They crop sweet flowers, and Dazies all the day: C. I love not Alcipp; (She I hop'd would prove More kind) when I presented Her a Dove, She did not clasp, and kiss, and call me Love; L. I love Eumedes much, I gave my Pipe, How sweet a kiss he gave; ah charming Lip! C. Thou art contentious, Lacon, end thy strains; Pyes should not strive with Thrushes, Owls with Swans: Morson. End, Shepherd, end thy strains, and dye for shame, For Morson says Comatas wins the Lamb: Go offer to the Muse, and send a Peice To Morson, for He claims it as his fees: Comatas. I will by Pan, my Goats all leap for joy: And I'le frisk too, I'le leap into the Sky: I'le toot at Lacon, I have won the Lamb, Go foolish Shepherd, pine, and dye for shame▪
Frisk, Goats, and leap; in Sybaris purling spring I'le wash you all, and all the while I'le sing: Push not the Kids, you Goat, till I have done The Sacrifice, if you dare push but one, Thou shalt— how now? well, thou shallt smart for this, Or may Comatas, He that wan the prize, Forget his Pipe, and loose his flock, be poor; And basely beg his bread at Laco's door.
Idyllium VI. Damaetas and Daphnis, meeting at noon, sing; Daphnis applies his Song to Polyphemus, who was in Love with Galataea, and Damaetas in his Person answers. To Thomas Wyndham of Lincolns Inn, Esquire. DAmaetas and the Herdsman Daphnis drove Their flocks to feed, and took one shady grove; The one was bearded, of a charming grace, The other young; Down cloath'd his lovely face; They sate and wanton'd by a purling spring I'th Middays heat; and thus began to sing; The lowing Herds lay round, and quencht their thirst; First: Daphnis sang, for He had challeng'd first: Daphnis. Fair Galataea from the smiling deep With Apples, Polyphemus, pelts thy Sheep; (See from the shore they all with hast remove) And says a Goatherd's an unskilful Love: But you poor wretch, ah wretch! ne're view the Maid, But sit, and pipe; and call to floods for aid: See there again, see how she pelts thy Spock, The faithful Dog that keeps thy wandring flock;
Hah, how he barks! and in a wild amaze Looks o're the flood! and whilst by shores he strays His shadow in the quiet water plays: Ah! call him back, lest when the Maid appears He rushes on, and her fair limbs he tears: But there she wantons, she, the charming fair, As Down of thistles in the Summer Air; And driven still by an unlucky fate Flies those that love, and follows those that hate: Her ways are foolish, and in vain she trys; But, Polyphem, mean things do oft surprize, For Love is Magick, and deceives the Eys: Damaetas. And next Damaetas sang; I chanc't to look, By Pan I did, whilst she did pelt my flock; She could not scape this Eye, this single one By which I see, and will, till Life is gone; Tho Tellemus foretells strange ills to come, Oh let him take, and keep his ills at home, And for his Children treasure up the Doom! But straightways I, to raise her flame the more, Seem not to see her trace the yielding shore; But can pretend I court another Miss; Then how she frets, Good God! and how she dys!
Oh with what eager hast she leaves the waves! My Folds she searches, and looks o're my Caves: Besides, my Dog, He is at my command, Shall bark at her and gently bite her hand: For whilst she was my Love, the only she, He fawn'd, and laid his head upon her knee: This if I practise long, shee'l strive to move, And send a Message to declare her Love: But I will shut my door, and scorn to heed, Unless she swears that she will grant her bed; For I'me not ugly, for last night I stood And view'd my Figure in a quiet stood; Let men say what they will, my face is fair, My Beard is fine, I'me sure; and neat my hair, And this one Eye, in my Opinion, rare: I have a set of Teeth, a finer white No Parian Marble boasts, a lovely sight: But lest she charm me, I have murmur'd thrice, Spit thrice for old Cotytto taught me this; She that of late in rich Hyppocoon's room Sate mids't the Reapers, and sang Harvest home: Thus sang Damaetas, and with eager joy Young Daphnis kisst, and claps't the lovely Boy:
I gave them gifts that suited with their youth, A Pipe, and Flute; and so I pleas'd them both: The jocund Heifers wanton'd o're the fields Whilst both unconquer'd stand, and neither yields:
Idyllium. VII. Theocritus was entertain'd by Phrasidamus and An∣tigones Licop's Sons, and invited into the Country to a feast they then kept: As He was going He meets Lycidas the Cretan, and each sings of his Love. To Mr. Tho Curganven. Now Ceres feast, was come, the Corn was grown, When I, and dear Eumedes left the Town, Amyntas made a third; we all design'd To pay a visit to a special friend, Rich Licop's Son, for then He kept the feast, And kindly bad me be a welcome guest: Rich Lycop's Son, the glory of the Plains, For generous blood runs thro his noble veins; From Chalco down it came, the brave, the bold, And gather'd still fresh honors as it roll'd. From Chalco down, That He, by whose command The Bourian spring o' reflows the fruitful Land, Around it Dazies grow, and all above Tall Poplars spread, and make a shady Grove: Scarce had we gone thro half the neighbouring Plain, By Brasil's Tomb we met a museing Swain: His name was Lycidas, the gay the young, A Cretan born, and fam'd for Rural Song:
Soon as we saw him, He by all was known To be a Goatherd, for He lookt like one: For o're his shoulders hairy skins were spread, They smelt as newly tand, or newly flead; A tatter'd Mantle o're his breast was cast, And ty'd with an old girdle to his wast; His right hand with a knotty Crab was fill'd; He lookt on me, and as he lookt, he smil'd: Gay, vigorous, sweet, and in the pride of youth, And as he spake a smile sat on his mouth: Where, Smichidas, where now at burning Noon, What urgent business makes Thee leave the Town? Whilst bleating flocks do seek the shades and cool, And every Lizzard creeps into his hole? What feast invites, or now I view your dress, Who treads his Grapes, and calls you to the press? Hark how at every step, you walk so fast, The Stones resound, and tell you are in hast: And I reply'd; dear glory of the Plains How great, how just a praise commends thy strains? Dear skilful Piper, Fame does loudly tell That you the Reapers, and the Swains excel, I'me glad on't, tho I think I pipe as well. We go to Ceres feast, this way we bend, And make a visit to a special friend,
He keeps it now, for she hath throng'd his floor; And payes the early tributes of his store: But since we walk one way, since time perswades, And we are far remov'd from gloomy shades; Let's Pipe, and wanton as we walk along, For we may please each other with a Song: For I can sing, and by our flattering Youth I'me prais'd, and call'd the charming Muses mouth; They say I pipe the best, and would deceive By praise; but I'me not easy to believe: My Songs are mean, my Pipe claims no repute Compar'd to Sceli's or Phileta's Flute; They me, and thus convince the flattering vogue, As Locusts tunes excell the croaking Frog: Thus I designdly; then He smil'd, and said, What glories, Smichidas, adorn thy head? Here take this Club, this token of my Love, 'Tis justly thine, thou care of mighty Jove: I hate the Mason, that, to boast his skill, Would raise a house to equal yonder hill: And those that rival the Sicilian Swain, I hate as much, and think their hopes as vain: But come, let's sing the Song I lately made, My Goats fed round, and wanton'd as I play'd; See if you like it; it hath pleas'd the Swains,
And sounds the best and newest of the Plains: Kind breathing Gales to Mitylenian shores Shall wast my Agis, Nymphs shall guide his Oars; Tho rainy South-winds angry Waves do raise, And rough Orion steps into the Seas; Oh would he ease my pains, give just returns, And Love for Love, for him the Goatherd burns: Let Halcyons smooth the Seas, the Storms allay And skim the floods before him all the way: The Nymphs lov'd bird, of all that haunt the flood, Skim o're the Waves, and dive for swimming food: Let my dear Agis, cut the angry Tide, And reach his Port, and there securely ride; For then with Violets or with Roses crownd I'le sport a Glass, and see his Health go round; I'le tost my Beans, to raise pall'd Appetite. Make me drink on, and lengthen the Delight: Whilst strecht on Beds I'le spend my easy hours, And roul, till I have lost my self in flowers: Then to his Health I'le sport a lusty Bowl, And pour Dear Agis Love into my Soul: Two Swains shall Pipe, the best of all the youth, And skillful Richards voice shall joyn with both, How Herdsman Daphnis did for Xenea burn, Trace o're the Woods, complaining of her scorn:
How Groves, and Echoes to his groans reply'd, And smooth Himera murmur'd when He dy'd: For He, as Snow when Summer heats the Grove Of Aetna, melted by the flame of Love: And how when force weak Innocence opprest, The Swain was shut alive into a Chest. And how the labouring Bees in every Plain Forsook their flowers, and buz'd about the Swain, Because the Muse had fill'd his charming mouth With Nectar, and preserv'd the pious youth: Happy Comatas, happy thou, the blest And wondrous darling at the Muses feast; Full twelve months nourisht by the labouring Bee, Oh had I then been born and liv'd with Thee! Then had I fed thy flock, and heard thy Pipe, Paid with a tune, and hung upon thy Lip; Whilst by a shady Tree, or purling spring Divine Comatas, thou shouldst sit and sing: Thus He, then I, dear Swain, whilst o're the hill I drove the Herds, the Muse improv'd my skill, Sweet tunes she taught, which same hath rais'd above, And bore on high to please the Ears of Jove: But this is choicest which I'le now produce To pleasure Thee, Thou darling of the Muse.
Love sneez'd on Smichid, for He Myrto loves As much as Goats the Spring, or Swains the Groves: Aratus too his dearest friend and joy, His dear Aratus deeply loves the Boy: And this sweet Acis knows, the gay, the young; Acis, a theme for great Apollo's Song: He knows how dear Aratus loves, he knows How great his flame, and how his passion grows: Pan, green Homala's Guardian, move the coy The soft Philinus; and enflame the Boy; Grown wanton, gay, and lavish of his Charms, Uncall'd for let him fly into his Arms: Ye smileing Loves, fair Venus soft delight, Like ruddy Apples pleasing to the sight, Leave Bybli's fountain, leave her purling streams That scorch the fields with her forbidden flames, And shoot Philinus, wound his stubborn mind, Shoot; for he hath no pitty for his friend; Tho soft as Parsly, tender as the Vine, And oh that he would clasp his Arms in mine! Mean while the weomen cry, and shake their heads Ah! ah! Philinus, ah thy Beauty fades! But dear Aratus let's endure no more Forget our Love, and fly the hated door:
And when the Cock calls forth the morning beams, Let broaken slumbers mixt with frighful dreams Disturb his thoughts, and by the neighbouring gate Ah! let him hang, and none bewail the Fate: Let us mind rest, and let's provide a charm To keep us safe, and free from future harm: Thes'e Songs we sung, and with a cheerful smile His Crook he gave me, to reward my skill; Take it, He said, 'tis mean, yet do'nt refuse, It is a pledge of friendship from a Muse: This said we parted, for invain we prest We could not force him to the promis'd feast: There Lycop's son, and all his friends around With sweet Amyntas sate with Roses crown'd: We lay, we wanton'd on a flowry bed, Where fragrant Mastick, and where Vines were spread, And round us Poplars rais'd their shady head: Just by a spring with pleasing Murmurs flow'd, In every bush, and thicket of the wood Sweet Insects sang, and sighing Turtles coo'd. The labouring Bees buz'd round the purling spring, Their Hony gather'd, and forgot their sting: Sweet Summers choicest fruits, and Autum's pride Pears by our head, and Apples by our side Lay round in heaps; and loaden Plums did stand
With bending boughs, to meet the reaching hand: To please us more he pierc't a Cask of Wine, Twas four years old, and from a noble Vine; Castalian Nymphs, ye Nymphs that still reside On steep Parnassus, and command his pride, Did e're old Chiron, did he e're produce For great Alcides such rich Bowls of juice? Did Polyphem the vast Sicilian Swain, That darted mountains o're the frighted main, Drink Wine like this, did e're such Bowls advance His Love-sick thoughts, and raise him to a dance? As then you gladly mixt to every guest, And poured on Cere's Altars at her feast? Oh may she often fill the fruitful Plain, And may I tread the Reeks, and fix the Fan; Whilst joyful she with smiles just thanks receives, And holds in either hand full bending Sheaves.
Idyllium VIII. Daphnis and Menalcas sing for a Wager, a Goatherd is chosen Judge, who determines Daphnis his Song to be the best. To Richard Hicks of the Mid. T. Esquire. THE Heardsman Daphnis walking o're the Plain The gay Menalcas met, a Sheapard Swain; Both yellow locks adorn'd, and both were young, Both rarely pip'd; and both divinely sung; Then first Menalcas rais'd his lovely head, And spake, and smil'd on Daphnis as he said; M. Come, Heardsman Daphnis will you pipe with me, I vow I'me sure that I can conquer Thee; I'me sure I can excel Thee as I will: D. And Daphnis thus reply'd; You boast your skill Menalcas, but I'me sure you can't excel, For pipe untill you burst I pipe as well: M. And shall we try? D. Yes Swain, I know my skill; M. And will you lay a wager? D. Yes I will: M. What will you lay, what equal to our fame? D. I'le stake a Calf, you stake a full-grown Lamb: M. I cannot stake a Lamb, for should I lose, My Father's jealous, and my Mother cross;
These watch, They know how many Lambs I keep, Both count my Lambs at night, and one my Sheep; D. What then? and what shall He that conquers, gain? M. I have a Pipe, 'tis new, of sounding Cane, Waxt at both ends, and tho I'le stake no prize That is my Father's, yet I'le venture this: D. And I have one, white Wax both ends secures It sounds as well, and is as new as yours: For when I made it, as I cleft the Reeds One prickt me, look e'en now my Finger bleeds; But since we venture, since such Pipes we lay Wha Man shall judge, and who shall hear us play? M. We'el call that Goathrd, look, the Swain is near, Our Dog barks at him, He perhaps will hear: The Sheapherds call'd, the Goatherd streight obey'd, The Goatherd judg'd, and thus the Sheapherds play'd: Menalcas first, then Daphnis tun'd his Cane, By turns they sang, Menalcas first began: M. Ye Vales, ye Springs that flow from distant Seas, If e're the sweet Menalcas Songs did please, Then feed my Lambs, if Daphnis drives his Kine To graze them here, feed his as well as mine: D. Ye Herbs and Flowers, ye glory of the Vales, If Daphnis songs are sweet as Nightingales
Then feed my Herds; if thro the flowry Mead Menalcas drives, then let his Lambs be fed: M. There Pastures flourish, there the Duggs do fill, The Lambs are suckled, and the Sheapherds smile Where my Boy comes, but when He leaves the place The Sheapherd wither's o're the fading Grass: D. There Sheep, there Goats bear twins, there labouring Bees Do sill their Hives, and there rise prouder Trees, Where Milo Treads, but when He leaves the place, The Herdsman withers, and the Herd decays: M. O Goat, the white Kids husband, stately Oaks, O flat-nos'd Kids make hast to purling Brooks For there He is, Go, let the Boy be show'd That Proteus fed his Sea Calves, tho a God: D. Not Pelops land, not heaps of Gold refind I wish, nor swiftness to outstrip the Wind, But let me fit and sing by yonde Rock, Clasp thee my Dear, and view my feeding flock: M. Rough storms to Trees, to Birds the treacherous Snare, Are frightful evils, Springes to the Hare; Soft Virgins love to man; Oh mighty Jove, Not I alone, but Thou hast stoopt to Love: Thus sang the youths by turns, and pleas'd the Swain, And thus Menalcas the last part began,
M. Woolf spare my Lambs, and let them safely bleat▪ For I am little, and my fold is great; How, White-foot, how so soon, so fast asleep; Is this your care, do you thus watch my Sheep? I faith you shall not sleep when one so young As I, is Sheapherd; and engag'd in Song: But feed dear flock, and crop the flowry plain, Feed, never fear, the Grass will grow again: Fill well your duggs, that when Night spreads her vail The Lambs may suck; and I may fill my Pail: And next fair Daphnis sang — D. And as I drove my Herd, a lovely Maid Stood peeping from a Cave; She smild, and said, Daphnis is lovely, ah a lovely youth; What smiles, what Graces sit upon his mouth! I made no sharp returns, but hung my head, And went my way, yet pleas'd with what she said: Winds sweetly murmur; The Steer sweetly lows, Sweet is the Heifers voice, and sweet the Cows: Tis sweet to ly in shades by purling streams In Summer's heat; dissolv'd in easy dreams: Acorns the Oaks, and Grass commends the Plain, Fat Calves do grace the Cows, and Cows the Swain:
Thus sang the youths, and thus the Goatherd said; Goatherd. Sweet is thy voice, and sweet the tunes you plaid Fair Daphnis, thro my Ears thy Songs have past Sweet to the Mind, as Hony to the Tast: And if you'l teach me, if instruct the Swain, That Goat is thine, it shall reward thy pain; See how her Udder swells, it ne're will fail, And every night it fills my largest Pail: The Boy rejoyc't, He leapt with youthful heat, As sucking Colts leap when they swig the Teat: The other griev'd, he hung his bashful head As married Virgins when first laid to bed: Thus Daphnis liv'd the glory of the Plains, Was thought the best, and lov'd by all the Swains: And to compleat the happiness of life The lovely Nais blest him in a Wife.
Idyllium IX. A Sheapherd invites Daphnis and Menalcas to sing, they pleasure him, and he rewards them both. To his Chum Tho. Lydgould, M.A. of Wadham. Col. SIng, Daphnis, sing; begin the rural lay, Begin sweet Daphnis; next Menalcas play: Mix Calves and Heifers, joyn the Bulls and Cows, And let them feed, and wanton in the boughs. Whilst you begin, begin the rural strain, And next Menalcas sing, and cheer the Swain: D. Sweet is the Heifers sound, and sweet the ine, Sweet is the Pipe's, the Swain's, and sweet is mine; By purling streams I have a shady bed, And or'e white Heifers skins are neatly spread, Ah careless Herd! they from a Mountains side Ah cruel storm! were blown, they fell, they dy'd: And there I value Summer's burning heats No more than Lovers do their Father's threats; Their Mother's kind complaints, or friends advice: This Daphnis sang, and next Menalcas this:
M. Me Aetna bred, to me she kindly gave Midst hollow Rocks a large and shady Cave: I live by pleasant Brooks, and purling Streams, And have as much as e're you saw in dreams: By me a thousand Goats, and flocks are fed, And Wool lies round my feet, and round my head: Soft Chitterlings afford me pleasing food, And when the Winter comes I'me stor'd with wood; So that I value Cold no more, not I, Than toohless Men do Nuts, when pulse is by: I clapt them both, to both rewards I threw, A Club that in my Father's Meadow grew To Daphnis, rude as from the Woods it fell, And yet scarce Art could shape a thing so well: Then next Menalcas did a shell receive, The flesh divided was enough for five, Caught in th' Icarian flood, He took the Shell, And smil'd as pleas'd; and lik'd the present well: Hail rural Muses, hail, produce the strains, Which once I sang, and pleas'd the listning Swains: I'le boldly sing, nor midst my wondrous Song Shall blisters rise, and gall my boasting tongue;
The Hawks to Hawks are friends, to Ews the Ews, To Larks the Larks are friends, to Me the Muse; Oh may I hear them still! The weary sleep, The Spring the Ploughman, shady Plains the sheep, Smooth Streams, and riseing flowers the labouring Bee Delight not half so much, as Muses Me; On whom they look and smile, secure they prove Fam'd Circe's Cup; nor fear the force of Love.
Idyllium X. Battus not reaping as fast as he was wont, Milo asks him the reason, Battus confesseth it was Love, and sings a Song in praise of his Sweet-heart. To my Chum Mr. Hody of Wadham Colledge. Milo. AH labouring Reaper, Wretch! what ails thee now! Thou canst not reap as thou wert wont to do; Nor yet so fast; look, He hath rais'd a Cock: You lag, as Sheep, when prickt, behind the flock: What wilt Thou do, poor wretch, before tis Noon, What wilt Thou do e're shady Night comes on Since, e're one land is cut, you fail so soon? B. Ah Milo! thou canst hold out all the day, But I'me grown weak; ah peice of flinty clay! Didst thou ne're wish for One that was away? M. Not I, for what have I that work for food To do with Love? He is an Idle God; Forget thy lazy thoughts, soft cares remove, B. Then, Milo, did you never wake for Love? M. And may it never, never break my sleep, For Dogs, once blooded, always run at Sheep:
B. But I have lov'd these ten long days, or more; M. A wealthy Man, enjoy thy fancy'd store, I am, and am contented to be poor: B. Hence 'tis that I'me o'rerun with lazy ease, My Field's neglected, and my Ploughs displease, M. But who thus wounds thee? B. Moll, the brisk the gay, She sung our Song, and was our Queen of May, M. Faith rightly serv'd, pursue thy vain delight, How that old Fly shall clasp thee all the Night! B. You flout; not only Pluto's Eyes are lost; But vexing Love's; forbear, rude Swain, to boast: M. I do not boast, but lay thy handful down, Throw by thy hook▪ unbend thy gather'd frown, And sing, (for you could sing) thy slender fair, Twill ease thy labour, and divert thy care. Battus. With me, sweet Muse, the slender Maid reherse, For all looks fair that you adorn with Verse: Bombyce charming, Sun-burnt, gastly thin You seem to many Eyes, but Brown to mine The letter'd Daffadil, and Vi'let's brown, Yet those are chiefest Graces of a Crown: The Goats their thyme, the Woolves the Goats pursue, The Crane the Plough; and I am mad for you:
Oh had I Craesus store, then both should shine, Two golden Statues fixt in Venus Shrine; Thy Hand should grace an Apple, Harp, or Rose, And me a danceing garb, and gawdy shows, Bombyce charming; oh wouldst Thou be kind! How sweet thy voice! but who can tell thy Mind? Milo. Hah, we ne're knew the value of the Swain, How well he Measures, how he tunes his Strain! Hah! no more sense, and yet thy beard so long! But stay, and hear the sweet Lytersa's Song. O fruitful Ceres bless this thriving Crop, Encrease, and make it larger than our Hope; Ye Reapers bind the Sheaves, lest some should say Ah lazy drones, they do'nt deserve their pay; Or to the North your Cocks, ye Reapers rear Or to the South, those Winds encrease the Ear: Ye Clowns that winnow never sleep at noon For then the Chaff is loose, and quickly gone: Reapers should rise with Larks, and sleep when They To Roost retire, but bear the heat all day: Frogs Lives, my boys, are blest, for midst their Pool They never want, their Cup is always full:
Boyl, Steward, boyl them whole, such pinching's mean: You'l cut your hand whilst you divide a Bean: Such Songs should Reapers sing that toyl, and sweat, That work at Noon, and bear the burning Heat, But starveing Love should never vex thy head, Such tales will bring Thee to a bit of bread, Tales for thy Mother, as She lies a bed.
Idyllium XI. He writes to a Physitian, and tells him that the Muses are the only Remedy for Love, which he proves by the example of Polyphemus. To Dr. Pitt of Wadham Colledge. IN vain, Learn'd Sir, invain is all your Art, There is no Physick for a wounded heart; No Herb can ease, no Salve the Pain remove, There is no cure for the disease of Love Beside the Muses; Those are soft and sweet, And pleasing Medcines, but are hard to get: This, Sir, you know whose skill is next divine In Physick; you, the darling of the Nine: Thus Polyphem found ease, the gay the young, He cured his rageing Passion by a Song: No mean degree of Love his breast did fire, He was all fury, rage, and wild desire; This single passion did his mind controul, And was the only business of his Soul: Oft did his Sheep his former chief delight, From Pastures fed return alone at night: Whilst on the Sedgy shore the Cyclops lay, And singing Galatea pin'd away:
From Morn till Night, for Venus powerful Dart Had gall'd his Liver, and had pierc't his heart. And yet He found a cure, on Rocks He stood, And thus he sang, as he lookt o're the stood: Fair Maid, and why dost thou thy Love despise? More white than Curds, and pleasing to my Eyes; More soft than Lambs, more wanton than a Steer, Yet harsh as Grapes unripe, and as severe: You come when pleasing sleep hath seald my Eye, When pleasing sleep unseals you quickly fly, You fly with eager hast, as fearful Lambs From ravening Woolves run bleating to their Dams: I lov'd Thee Nymph, I lov'd e're since you came. To pluck our Flowers, from thence I date my flame: My Eye did then my feeble heart betray, I know the minute of the fatal day, My Mother led you, and I show'd the way: Then when I lookt, and ever since I burn, I must Love on despairing a return: The cause of all thy hate, dear Nymph, I know, One large wide Gap spreads cross my hairy Brow From Ear to Ear, one Eye doth singly grace, My Nose is flat, and even to my face: Yet I, that ugly I, whom you refuse Feed thousand Goats, and milk ten thousand Ews,
These give me drink, and Cheeses all the year, See round my Cave my loaden Shelves appear, And bend beneath the weighty heaps they bear. Besides, I live the joy of all the Plain, No Cyclops can pretend so sweet a strain, Thee, Thee, dear Nymph, with Thee my self I sing, Till Midnight's past, and Morning spreads her Wing: Ten Cubs, I forc't them from an angry Bear, Ten Does I keep; and all to please my Dear; Come live with Me, and I sincerely vow That your condition shan't be worse than now; Forsake the Ocean, leave the angry Sea, Tis better sleeping in my Cave with Me, There Lawrels grow, and there black Ivy twines, And blushing Clusters load the bended Vines: There are cold streams which from the melting Snow Hot Aetna sends, a drink divine, below: There all things are by Nature form'd to please, And who before all this would choose the Seas? But grant that I'me deform'd, unseemly rough, Yet I am rich, and I have Wood enough, A constant blazeing flame still heats my Cave, I follow Heinsius. Tho by this Eye, the dearest thing I have, I want no outward heat, the fierce desire That burns my Breast, is a sufficient fire;
Ah me! unhappy me, how Fate prevails! Oh me! Had I been born with sins and scales, That I might dive to you, cut thro the Deep, And kiss your Hand, if you refuse your Lip; Then would I Lillies white, and Roses bring, And all the gawdy glories of the Spring, With Poppies blushing leaves, tho these do grow In Summers heat, and those in frost and snow: Well, well, Ile learn to swim, next nimble Oars That set a Seamen on our fruitful Shores Shall teach me how to dive, that I may know What pleasure 'tis you take in Waves below: Come forth, fair Nymph, come forth, and leave the main, And (as I now) ne're mind thy home again, But feed the Flocks with me, or milk the Sheep, Or run the Cheese, and never mind the Deep: My Mother's cross, her just Complaints pursue, For she ne're spoak of me kind things to you, Alltho she knew my grief, saw every day How much I wasted, how I pin'd away: I'le tell, to fright her, that my head, my thigh Are pain'd: that she might grieve as well as I: O Cyclops, Cyclops, are thy senses flown! Is all thy former wit, and vertue gone?
Go wreath thy Baskets, cut the tender boughs To feed the Lambs, and milk the burdned Cows, Go mind thy Harvest work, for that will prove Thy Wisdom greater than this whineing Love: Take those that offer, and the proud despise, The willing Love, and scorn the Maid that flies: Come leave this fooling, leave this dull despair, Another Virgin thou shallt find as fair; For many Maids invite me still to play, And titter all, as pleas'd, when I obey: Sure I am somewhat, they my worth can see, And I my self will now grow proud of Me: 'Thus Polyphemus cur'd his strong disease, His Songs tam'd Love, and gave more certain ease, Than if He had implor'd the Doctor's skill, And with just fees bought your unerring Bill.
Idyllium. XII. A Welcome to a Friend. To Mr. Edward Eaton. YOU come dear youth, now three long days are gone, You come; But Lovers do grow old in one; As much as Spring excells the Frost and Snow, As much as Plums are sweeter than a Sloe, As much as Ews are thicker fleec't than Lambs, As much as Maids excel thrice marry'd Dames: As much as Colts are nimbler than a Steer, As much as Thrushes please the listning ear More than the meaner Songsters of the Air; So much thy presence cheers; behold, I run, As Travellers to the shade at burning Noon: Oh may an equal flame our hearts engage, And let us live in Songs thro future Age! Two youths were once with mutual bands confin'd, The one was generous, and the other kind: Their Love was equal; those were golden Men, When He that was belov'd did love agen: Grant ye Immortal Powers, grant mighty Jove, Grant this once more, encrease these bands of Love;
When future Ages shall in order flow Let some descend, and tell my shade below, Thy Love, thy Lover's kindness, Faith and Truth, Are prais'd by All, but chiefly by the youth: But this I leave to Heaven's indulgent care, For Heaven can grant, or can reject my Prayer. Yet Thee I'le sing; Thee sweet, nor midst my Song Shall tell-tale Blisters rise, and gall my Tongue: The little pains you rais'd were kindly meant, Your healing Love did all the smart prevent; And I departed fraught with good content: Brave Megarensians fam'd for nimble Oars, May Peace flow in, and plenty crown your Shores, The Honors you bestow on Diocles, That constant Friend and Lover, claim no less; At his fam'd Tomb each year the boys contend Which kisses softest, which best loves his friend, And He that kisses sweetest wins the praise, And runs to his glad Mother crown'd with bays: Happy the Man that must bestow the prize, Thrice happy He that judges of the Kiss! Fair Ganymed that makes the Thunderer bow, Whose smiles can calm, and smooth his angry brow, Allay his fury and his rage command And stop his lightning in his lifted hand;
Had such a Lip (or Fame hath often ly'd, And Fame errs seldom on the better side) That like a Touch-stone try'd the proffer'd joy, And could discern true Gold from base alloy.
Idyllium XIII. He writes to his friend, a Physitian, and tells him that Love conquers the greatest Heroes, which He proves from the story of Hercules and Hylas. To Mr. William Gould M.B. of Wadham Colledge. LOve, Love, dear Friend, what e're we think 'tis true, Was not design'd for only such as you; Nor do the Charms of Beauty strike alone Us Mortals, seen to day, to morrow gone; But Hercules that Son of mighty Jove, That bore the Lion's fury. stoopt to Love: Tho rough his mind appear'd, tho steel'd to joy He Hylas claspt, and lov'd the charming Boy: He taught him as a Father would a Son, To vertuous actions still He led him on: They never parted, nor at noon, nor night, Nor when the Morn's white Horse daws forth the light, Nor when the callow Birds ly down to rest, And careful old Ones flutter o're the Nest: That still instructing as He once began, He might be wrought into a worthy Man: But when stout Jason with the youths of Greece To Colchos sail'd, their prize the Golden Fleece:
When he had gather'd all the Sons of fame That could assist, the great Alcides came To fair Jolcos, Argo's chiefest freight; Young Hylas too. the Ship scarce felt his weight: She, swift as Eagles, ply'd her nimble Oars, And safely scap't the rough Cyanean Shores. Which us'd to meet, and stave the Ships that past, But now are fix't, on firm foundations plac't: When Summer came, and when the tender Lambs Began to feed on Grass, and leave their Dams, The noble Hero's, blest with Southern Gales, Thro Hellespont did spread their swelling Sails: Thro the Propontis they did swiftly row, Where stout Cyanean Oxen wear the Plow: And landing there as shady Night came on And call'd to eat, they sate in order down: Soft Turfs were rais'd, and each possest his place, The Plain was large and gave them Beds of Grass. The charming Hylas, quick as the command, A brazen Vessel grac't his lovely hand, Ran o're the Field to see what Springs afford, And fetch some Fountain water for his Lord; His Lord, and Telamon his constant guest, One Table always joyn'd them a feast:
Just by, a murmuring Spring crept o're the ground, The Banks with Vervine, and with Parsly crownd, Within, the Nymphs, the Ladies of the Plains, The watchful Nymphs that dance, and fright the Swains: Eunica, Malis, and their chiefest grace Nicoea, Spring still opens in her face: This Hylas saw, his Cup let gently down, Well pleas'd that He could serve his Lord so soon; But streight the Nymphs, (for Love had div'd below; Their tender hearts did midst the Water glow, The Boys fair Eyes had darted warm desire, And thro the Waves had rais'd a fatal Fire:) Seiz'd on his hand, he fell, as soret from Clouds A falling Star shoot's down to under Floods: Mean-while the Boat Swain crys, Mates spread the sails The Wind's at Stern, and we have prosperous gales: The Nymphs danc't Hylas, Kisses dry'd his Tears, And Comforts were apply'd to ease his Fears: But vext Alcides, Care with Anger strove, And tore his Breast, resolv'd to find his Love, His left hand grac't a Bow of fatal Ewe, Death wing'd and pointed every Dart that flew; His right a knotty Club did well command, That constant grace and terrour of his hand;
Thrice did He Hylas call, and thrice He mourn'd, Thrice Hylas heard the voice, and thrice return'd: But small the sound which thro the Waves did rise, Tho near, far off he seem'd; so weak the crys: As shaggy Lions fierce by Hunger grown, That hear a Kid or Lamb kin bleat alone, Start from their Den, and lash their angry Breast, And fiercely run to take their easy feast: So He thro thorny paths did wildly rove, As mad and furious for his perisht Love: Mean while the Ship was rig'd, the Winds were fair And sails were spread, but no Alcides near; He far remov'd did rove thro Paths untrod For Love had gall'd his breast, a cruel God: Hence Hylas grew a God, and grac't a shrine, His Love and Beauty made him half divine; Mean while the Heroes fir'd with martial rage Alcides blam'd as fearful to engage, It argu'd not his Love, but prov'd his fear To leave the Ship, and so decline the War; But he on foot to barbarous Phasis came, And noble actions soon redeem'd his Fame.
Idyllium XIV. Eschines being scorn'd by Cunisca, who had a greater kindness for one Woolf, resolves to turn Souldier; His Friend Thynichus advises him to serve King Ptolomy. To his Friend and Tutor Mr. Balch of Wadham Coll. E. GOod morrow Thynicus. T. The like to you; E. But why so late? T. So late? What ails thee now? E. All is not well: T. I see't, you look so thin, Your Face not washt, your Beard spread o're your Chin, now? Your Eye-brows thick, last night I chanc't to view Poor Phythagorist, and He lookt like you: le, barefoot, an Athenian, as He said, But, saith, He lookt as if on Meal He fed: E. You joque; But fair Cunisca scorns my Love, And as her hatred so my flames improve, And th perhaps I no such heats betray'd Yet I'me witin an Inch of stareing mad: T. You still were passionate, you still pursue What your perverse desire hath once in view, But prethe tell me what disturbs anew: E. Tom, Wil, an Dick, and I, a jovial Crew, Not minding Fate that did too close pursue,
Drank at my House, the Glass went briskly round, Our hearts were merry, and each head was crown'd; I made them welcome, got the best I cou'd, A sucking Pig, two Chicken, Country food, And, tho I say't my self, my Wine was good: Twas four years old, yet mild, I vow tis true, With Burrage mixt it drank as well as new: At last we voted each should crown a Glass What Health he pleas'd, but name whose health it was; We drank, and halloo'd, She mute all the while And sullen sate, without one word or smile; How was I vext to find a change so soon? What Mute? what have you seen aAlludcing to the common saying. Woolf says one? At that she slusht, her guilty color rose, That you might light a Candle at her Nose: There's Woolf, there's Woolf, my Neighbour Labia's Son, Tall, slender, and the beauty of the Town: For him she burns, and sighs, and sighs again, And this I heard, but loath to find my pain, I let it lye, and grew a Man invain: When we were heated well, and slusht with Win, One sang a Song of Woolf, a curst design,
For streight Cunisca wept at the surprize, And soon betray'd her passion at her Eyes; She wept as wanton Girls that leave their Pap, And would be dandled on their Mother's Lap: Then I, you know me, vext at this disdain; Fled at her, strook, and swore, and kickt again; She rose; Oh Mischief! can I please no more? Have you another Sweet-heart? Out you Whore; Must you do this now to confirm my fears? Go to him, toy, and court him with your tears: As swift as Swallows sweeping o're the Plain, To catch their young a fly, with nimble pain, Catch one, then feed, and streight return again; So quick she left her Seat, so swift her hast, So soon she thro the Hall and Parlor past, I scarce could see her move, she went so fast: Now twenty days, and ten, and nine, and eight, And one, and two are past; two months compleat; Yet still we differ, nor in all this space Have I shav'd once, regardless of my face: But she is Woolf's, and Woolf's her chief delight, For him she will unlock the Gate at night, But I am scorn'd, I can't be lookt upon, She'l scarce vouschase the favor of a fown:
And yet, Dear friend, could I but break the chain And hate her once, all would be well again, But as the Proverb says, the heedless Mouse Hath bitten Pitch, and how shall he get loose? What Physick can these vexing Pains remove! I know no Cure for the disease of Love, Yet Dick, my friend, that equal pains endur'd For Betty, travell'd, and was quickly cur'd: And saith I'le travel too, I scorn to boast My Courage, yet I think I'me stout as Most: T. I wish Thou hadst enjoy'd thy just desire, And gain'd thy Love; But if Thou willt retire Serve Ptolomy, for He'l reward thy pain, Believ't, He loves a stout and honest Man; E. What other Vertues! T. Oh the greatest Mind, The sweetest: temper, Generous, and Kind, He marks his friend, but more he marks his foe, His hand is allways open to bestow: Petition modestly He grants the thing, And freely gives as it becomes a King; And therefore, Lover, if you bravely dare To ty your Snapsack on, and go to War, If Thou canst keep thy Post, and stand thy ground, And throw back on thy foe the comeing wound,
To Aegypt hast, make hast, e're youth decays, First from our Temples Age begins her race, Thence whitening Time creeps softly o're the face: Go on whilst youth is Green, and strength dost last, For when old Age draws nigh, the Time is past.
Idyllium XV. Two tatling Gossips go to see the Pomp at Adonis's Feast, prepar'd by Arsinoe Ptolomy Philadelphus's Queen; The humors of the Weomen he hitts exactly; intermixes some praises of the King, and describes the Glory of the Pomp to gratify the Queen. The Persons are Gorgo, Eunoe, Praxinoe, Nurse, Stranger and Mother. To Mr. Rice Williams of Wadham Coll. G. SWeetheart, is my Praxinoe at home? E. She is dear Gorgo, but how late you come? P. I scarce expected you, and sate alone, A Chair and Cushion, E Ready: P. Pray sit down: G. Ah me, I scarce could get alive along So close the people press, so great the throng; Coaches thro every Street, and Liveries shine; Beside your dwelling is so far from mine: P. Yes, my cross Sot must leave his former Seat, And on the edge of th' World choose this retreat, More like a filthy Cave than like a House, And this he does, kind heart, to separate us, My constant plague, and my continual cross.
G. Soft words, pray Madam, soft, see here's your Son, Look how he eyes you, and begins to frown: P. Cheer up my Child, I did not mean thy Dad, N. He understands her, he's a pretry Lad: P. He went last night, (old faults are all forgot,) To buy some Soap, and what d' ye think he bought? Bay Salt, longsided Fool, dull Booby Sot: G. Ah me, and mine's as bad, a squandring fool, Last Market day he went to cheapen Wool, And there five Fleeces for five Crowns he bought, All coath'd Sheep's Wool, meer dirt, not worth a Groat: But take your Hood and Scarf, and pray let's go, Let's hast to Court, for there's a gawdy show: Adonis Feast, and as I lately heard Our Royal Queen hath glorious sights prepar'd: P. Great Folks have all things fine, but pray now tell What you, for I saw nought, or nought so well: G. Another day, but now the minute calls, We that have nought to do have time for tales: P. Maid, Water quickly, faith I'le break your head, Go set it down; These Cats so love a bed, Drive them away, they'l spoyl my Cloth of State, But first the Water, there's most need of that: See how she speeds! come pour: but why so soon? A little more: what makes you wet my Gown?
Well, now I'me fairly washt the Gods be blest, But bring me streight the Key of my great Chest: G. This Mantoe sits extreamly well, I vow, What prize the Stuff? pray Madam let me know: P. It cost me twenty Shillings half a Crown, Twas dear, beside the work was all my own: G. Tis rare; P. Your Servant, Madam, bring my Hood, And Scarf, and dress me in the newest Mode; Dear Chuck, you must not go, my dear delight, For there are Bugbears, and the Horses bite, Nay you may cry, peace, peace, dear Mother's Child, Nay cry, but, Chuck, I must not have you kill'd: Here Betty take the Boy, and stay at home, Call Pretty in, and wait here till I come. O Jemminy, dear Gorgo, here's a throng, I wonder how we two shall get along: Great Ptolemy, beside a thousand things In which Thou hast excelld the former Kings; How many profits have thy care bestow'd Since Lagus dy'd and rose into a God? None now, as heretofore, infest the Street, Pick pockets, croud, and justle all they meet, What shall we do? you see we strive invain, Ah Dear, I wish I was at home again:
The Kings great Horses come, stand farther, friend, Dont tread upon me, see he rears an end, Look how he bounds, oh whether shall we run? Alas poor Soul, he'l throw his Rider down, Well, I am glad I did not bring my Son: G. Cheer up Praxinoe, come, the danger's past, And they are gone before, let's mend our hast: P. Well, now I'me comeing to my self again, A Horse, and a cold Serpents winding train allways hated; fy, we move too slow, Look there behind what Tides of People flow! G. Mother i'st you within? M. Yes Child, tis I, G. Can we get in pray Mother? M. Daughter try: For he that never trys can ne're enjoy; The Greeks by trying, Daughter, conquer'd Troy: P. She leaves us with a Riddle, what she means God knows, but sure she hath some hidden sence. Weomen know all below, and all above, E'en how Queen Juno was betroth'd to Jove: But look Praxinoe, how the People wait, How great a throng attends the crouded Gate: P. A vast one Gorgo: come, tis best to joyn, Hands round; here Gorgo, clap your hand in mine: Take Eutick Eunoe, that we may not loose Each other, come, thrust all, and still keep close:
Ah me, my veil is rent, pray, why d'ye press? My Gown! Good Sir, may Heaven conspire to bless, And you be happy Sir, as you forbear; S. I cannot, yet I'le take the greatest Care: P. The Croud increaseth, and they thrust like Swine, S. Come cherr up Madam, we are all got in: P. Well, may the bounteous Gods reward thy pain For helping us, thou art an honest Man, Poor Eunoe's justled still, she'l lose her Hood, Thrust Eunoe, stoutly thrust, and break the Croud; We are all in, as One (a Story) said When he had got his Mistress fast in Bed: G. Praxinoe look, what Hangings grace the Rooms, How fine, how rich, sure wrought in Heav'nly Looms: Oh strange, what hands could these fine things design? What Mortal Pencil draw so sweet a line? How real they appear? They seem to move, They are alive, I'me sure they can't be wove: Man's a wise thing, but see on yonder bed Adonis lies, Down o're his Cheeks is spread, Lovely Adonis, lov'd amongst the Dead: S. Hist, hist, your tatling silly talk forbear, Like Turtles you have Mouths from Ear to Ear: G. And who are you? Pray what have you to say If we will talk? Seek those that will obey,
Would you the Syracusian Weomen rule? Besides, to tell you more you medling Fool, We are Corinthians, that's no great disgrace, Bllerophon himself did boast that race: We speak our Language, use the Dorick tone, And, Sir, the Dores, sure, may use their own: P. Our Husbands are enough, let none pretend To rule beside; you are a sawcy friend, I'me ne're beholding t'ye, and there's an end: G. Peace, peace Praxinoe, streight in charming lays A Maid shall sing the dead Adonis praise, More soft than Sperchis in a mournful Song, Hark, she prepar's her voice, it won't be long▪ Great Goddess, joy of the Idalian Grove, To whom high Eryx Bows, fair Queen of Love, How charming was thy sweet Adonis lead By soft-soot hours from midst the silent Dead? The twelfth month came, when from the shades below Restord, what Beauty sate upon his Brow? The Hours the slowest of the Gods, tis true, Yet pleasing, for they still bring something new: Kind you (thus story says) did first remove Fair Berenice to the Seats above, And bath'd the Mortal in a Cup of Love:
And now Arsinoe, Helen's equal face, ust return does thy Adonis grace With all the fruit the various Earth can yeild, The Silver Basket brings from every field The choicest Flowers that please the curious Eye: In Gold the Syrian Odors breath, and dye: Of Flour and Hony mixt the sweetest Cake That Weomen's Luxury or Art can make: The Earth and Sea do give a vast supply, And Air sends all the various Kinds that fly: She raises fresh imaginary Groves, And all around do flutter wanton Loves, As new-fledgd Thrushes whilst the old one sings Do leap from bough to bough, and try their Wings: O Gold! See there two Ivory Eagles fly And bear young Ganymed thro the yielding Sky: See Purple Tapestry more soft than seep, This He'l confess that feeds Milesian Sheep: Oh happy Riches, see, two Beds are Made, And Venus here, there fair Adonis laid, A youthful Bride-groom, just mature for Bliss, No prickly Beard makes rough his pleasing Kiss: Let Venus have him, and his sweets embrace, To morrow e're the Dew forsakes the Grass
Wee'l bear him where the Waves foam round the shore Our Hair all loose, our Coats let down before, Our Breasts all bear, and as we march along With mournful voice, begin this Funeral Song: Adonis, of the Heroes you alone Now come to Ʋs, now go to Acheron; Not Agamemnon, not stout Ajax knew, And none enjoy'd the favor like to you: Not Hector, fruitful Priam's stoutest joy, Not Pyrrhus comeing from his conquer'd Troy: The Antient Lapithae Ducalion's race, Or brave Pelasgi Argo's chiefest grace: Kind now Adonis, next year kind remain, Now welcome, welcome when you come again: G. Ah dear Praxinoe, these are Curious things, O happy Creature, oh how well she sings! But I must go, for should m Husband come, He hath not din'd, and not find me at home, How he would fret, He's pettish, hates delay, Nor when He's hungry would I come ins way. Farewel Adonis, now thy Pomp must cease; But still return, and still our joys encrease.
Idyllium XVI. He complains that Poetry meets not a suitable Reward from Great Men, for that immortality which it bestows upon them. To his very good Friend John Dryden Esquire. THis is the Muses, this the Poets care To sing the Gods, and Men renown'd for War: The Muses Goddesses make Gods their theme, We Men sing Men, and raise them vast esteem? But who that lives below our pains regards? What open hand doth pour out fit rewards? Who doth receive us when we offer Fame? And send us back more wealthy than we came? The Muses baffled thus turn home again With naked feet, they sigh, they weep, complain, And frown at Me, when they have gone invain. Deep in the bottom of my empty Clest, A place too hollow, and too hard for rest, They sit and mourn; on their cold knees they lay Their bending heads, and sigh, and pine away: For who is brave? and who regards a Wit? I know not; few, ah few in praise delight:
For great and noble deeds as heretofore; Their Captive thoughts are ty'd to baser Ore: Their covetous hands they in their laps do fold, And scarce will give the Rust that eats their Gold: They cry, near is my Shirt, more near my Skin, Must I supply the hunger of the Nine? Let me grow rich in wealth, and Those in sence, A Poet is the care of Providence: What need of more since Homer lives? He brings No charge upon me, yet's the best that sings. Poor Men! what profits precious Ore that lies Heap't up within to feed the greedy Eyes? It yeilds a different profit to the wise: Some on themselves some part on Wits they spend, Some part their Kinsmen share, and some their friend; To every Man from them some goods accrew, And still the Gods receive their sacred due: He's kind and generous, nobly treats his guests, He never cloys, but pleases with his feasts. But chiefly to the Muses Sons they give, That after Death their lasting fame may live: And that they may not sit and mourn below, As those whose hands are hardned by the Plough Who sit, and sigh; and with a sad complaint For ever weep hereditary Want:
Antiochus once kept a kingly board, A thousand Menial Servants call'd him Lord: A thousand Heifers fed at Scopa's stall, Ten thousand horned Bulls low'd thro his vale, The kind Creondae fed their numerous Flocks, Their brouzing Goats still hung on Thousand Rocks: Yet when their naked Souls began to float Breath'd out in Air, and stow'd in Charon's Boat, They left their wealth beyond the Stygian shore, The crazy Vessel could not waft their Ore; And each had lain amidst the vulgar, lost, Unheard, untalkt of, like a common Ghost, Unless his Poet with exalted rage Had strook his Harp, and given them future Age. 'Tis Verse that doth with lasting Honor's grace The swiftest Horse that wins the sacred race: His Crowns had wither'd he had lost his name, Too slow to keep an equal pace with Fame: Who had the Lycians, who the Trojans known? What Fame once-female Cycnus Glory blown? Unless a Poet with immortal Song Had told their fights, and made their Wars so long? Ʋlysses, He thro various dangers tost For seven long years, that toucht at every Coast,
That He that saw the Stygian shades and liv'd, That scap't the Cyclops, had his fame surviv'd; Eumaeus, mingled with the Common Dead, Had lain as nameless as the Ox he fed, And wholy vanisht with his parting breath, If Homer had not snatcht his name from Death: The Muses raise Men's worth, their Fame they spread, Whilst Heirs consume the riches of the Dead: And 'tis a task I'me sure of equal ease To tell how many Tempests toss the Seas, With what fierce Storms the troubled Ocean roars, How many Waves it rouls to trembling Shores, To wash a Blackmore white, as to unbind A Gripeing Niggard's close contracted mind, And force him to be generous and kind: A Curse on such, vast heaps of useless Ore May those enjoy, and yet still wish for more; 'Twas allways so, and 'tis my humor still, Much more than Wealth I value Men's good-will: And now I seek what Patron I may choose, And where I may be welcome with my Muse: For Poets find but small returns of Love Without their Muse, thus stands the will of Jove: The Heaven's not weary whilst it whirls the Sun, And thousand Steeds shall draw the Charriot on,
A Man shall rise that shall my Songs employ As great as fam'd Achilles fought at Troy: As great as Ajax where smooth Simois flow'd, And Phrygian Ilu's Tomb lay drown'd in Blood; The Carthaginians dread approaching War, Forget their fury, and consent to fear: The Syracusian Troops spread ore the field, Their right-hands grace a Spear, their left a shield; These Hiero leads as antient Heroes brave, His dreadful Crest doth o're his Shoulders wave: But oh our Guardian Jove, revenge our Blood, And toss our Foes o're the Sardinian flood, Scatter their force, and send few home to tell The Wives and Children how their Fathers fell: Let old Inhabitants possess their Isle; And raise new Towns where Foes did lately spoyl; The Fields be green, and thro the fruitful Plain Great flocks of Sheep grow fat, and bleat again: The labouring Oxen bend beneath the Plough, And, slowly walking thro the Vallies, low: The Fields be reapt whilst under every shade The Insects sing, and make the Reapers glad: The Spiders weave in Sheilds, all free from fear, And hardly know the very name of War:
Let riseing Poets bear the sounding praise Of Hiero beyond the Scythian Seas; Beyond proud Babylon extend his Fame, And tell to distant worlds his glorious Name: I am but one, but more Jove's Daughters love, More wise than I am, and more apt to move: And these smooth Arethusa's streams shall sing, The brave Sicilians, and their valiant King: Ye Goddesses that Orchomenium grace The scourge and hatred of the Theban race, Uncall'd I'le stay, to those that shall invite My Muse shall offer honor and delight: I'le never leave you; what will Men receive Without the Graces? what is fit to give? O, may I ever with the Graces live!
Idyllium XVII. A Panegerick to King Ptolemy. To Ambrose Brown of — Esquire. BEgin with Jove, my Muse, and end with Jove, If you would sing the greatest God above, But if you would the best of Men reherse, Let Ptolemy's great name adorn your Verse; Let him the first, midst, last, your Songs employ, The darling of Mankind, the common joy: The Heroes born of Gods, and great in fame, Had noble Poets to record their name; And I, well skill'd in Song, with lasting lays Sing him, E'en Gods we do reward with praise: In shady Ida, where the Woods are thick, The Woodman comes, but doubts where first to strike And where shall I? there croud a thousand things, With which the Gods have blest the best of Kings: His father Lagus, who so bravely great? So deeply skill'd in all the Arts of State? What Age could boast a Prince so great so good? His Mind was high, and noble as his Blood:
Him Jove doth grace with an immortal Throne, And give a golden Palace next his own: Next Alexander sits, the Wise, the Great, A miter'd God, and checks the Persian State: Just opposite Alcides Throne doth shine, Of sparkling Diamond, the work divine; And whilst on Nectar with the Gods he feasts, He smiles too see his race his equal guests: On each great Jove repreive from Age bestow'd, And call'd immortal, rais'd into a God: When fragrant Nectar Bowls have rais'd his fires, And from the feast he to his Wife retires, His Ensigns he delivers to the Two One bears his knotty Club, and one his Bow; With these they both in decent order move, And thus to beauteous Hebe's bed of Love Their father lead, the great encrease of Jove: How Berenice shone! His charming Bride, Her Sexe's glory, and her Parents pride; Her Venus nurst with a peculiar care, And blest with all the charms that grace the fair; That e'en bold Fame it self scarce dares to tell That any Prince e're lov'd his Wife so well As generous Ptolemy his beauteous Queen; And yet he meets with greater love agen!
He Quits his State, and business of his Thrones, He leaves his Kingdom to his Loyal Sons, Whilst he to her with hasty wishes moves, And goes to play the Heroe in his Loves: A faithless Wife lets all her thoughts and cares On others rove, with easy pains she bears, Her House is full, but of the numerous race Not one can show the joyful Father's face: Fair Venus chiefest Beauty of the Sky She liv'd thy care, nor can her honor dye; Your kindness snatcht her from the Stygian shore, E're grisly Charon came to waft her o're, You gave a shrine, and taught us to adore: Just like a falling Star thrown down by Fate; You caught, and made her Partner of your State; Thence kind to all she gentle Cares inspires; And warms the Lovers breasts with pleasing fires: The fair Deipale did to Peleus bear Stout Diomed, that mighty Son of War, And beauteous Thetis to her Peleus bore The fam'd Achilles on the Grecian shore, But Berenice hath these Births outdone, She brought great Ptolemy as great a Son; First Coos danc't Thee, Thee, Mankind's delight, She took Thee at thy first approach to light,
For there thy Mother to Lucina pray'd To ease her throws, and found a speedy Aid; She came, stood by, and gently loos'd her pain, Thy very birth was easy as thy reign: The Island took Thee in her Arms, and smil'd To view the Father's Image in the Child: She shouted, and she said, Ah lovely Boy, Be born, Thy Father's Soul, be born my joy: Welcome, on me as great a Fame bestow, As Delos does to her Apollo owe: Thus spake the I'sle; an Eagle soar'd above And mixt with Clouds; the Bird of mighty Jove, With joyful sound thrice clapt auspicious Wings, 'Twas Jove's own sign, Jove is the Guard of Kings: But whom he loves as soon as he began, That lives the Potent, that the happy Man All else must yeild, and o're the Sea and Land With conquering Arms he spread a wide command: A thousand Nations boast their fruitful Plains, Where gentle Jove descends in easy rains, But none such Crops as sandy Egypt shows, Where Nile with his enriching streams o'reflows, And what the barren Clouds deny, bestows: No Nation bears, no Nation boasts to see So many Towns, and Men of Art as She,
Full Thirty Thousand Towns enjoy the sway Of Ptolemy, and eagerly obey: The stout Phaenicians too have felt his Sword, Arabia, Syria, Lybia call him Lord; The Ethiopians, the Pamphilian Horse, The Lycians, Carians own his nobler force: The Isles; for where his Navy spreads her Wings Homage to Him, and Peace to all she brings: So far his Scepters reach, and Sea, and Land And purling Streams obey his just Command: Vast Troops of Horse and Foot well arm'd for War So dreadful gay in graceful ranks appear, That e'en their proudest Foes consent to fear: His Treasure richer than e're known before, And other Kings scarce wish so great a store; All Nations send their Customs every day, And their due Tribute to his Ocean pay: The Farmer fearless ploughs his fruitful soil, No Hostile Navies press the quiet Nile; None leaps a Shore, and frights the labouring Swains, None robs us of our Flocks, and spoyls the Plains: Thus Ptolemy secures his Land from Harms, So fear'd by All he sits, so great in Arms: So careful to preserve his antient right,
This shows a King, and for new Conquests fight: And yet he doth not hoord his useless Ore, As painful Ants still turn their bury'd store; With much the Temples of the Heroes shine; His first-fruits, and his gifts sill every shrine, Much Gold to powerful neighbouring Kings he sends, Much to his Subjects, much to valiant Friends: None fam'd for Song, none great in Arts appears No charming voice can ravish listning Ears, But streight He favors, He rewards imparts, And sends them presents equal to their Arts: And therefore Poets with exalted rage Send down their Patron's praise to future Age; At what more noble can the wealthy aim Than to secure a fair, and lasting Fame? Of Great Atrides this remains alone, Whilst are the Stores of Wealth He rais'd, are gone: What e're he brought from Troy hath scap't the light, And now lies bury'd in Eternal night. He first his Glorious Parents made divine, To both He incense burns, and rears a shrine: How great they stand! how Gems their shrines enfold, And hide the Ivory, and the poorer Gold! How great they stand! what various goods bestow!
Supply our wants, and guard frail Man below: He stains red Altars with a Thousand Beasts As Months roul round, and bring the solem Feasts: He and his Queen, than whom kind Fortune led No fairer Woman to a greater Bed; There She with joy the Natural ties improves, And both as Brother, and as Husband loves: This Gods approve, thus they themselves are ty'd, And Juno lives Jove's Sister, and his Bride; Fair perfum'd Iris makes one Bed for both, Where Pleasure's hightned by eternal youth: Hail glorious Ptolemy, hail mighty King; Thee equal to the Gods my Muse shall sing; And future Age shall all my Songs approve; Great King, beg Vertue, and encrease of Jove:
Idyllium XVIII. An Epithalamium at the Marriage of Helena and Menelaus. To Edward Courthope Esquire. AT Sparta's Palace twenty beauteous Maids, The Pride of Greece, fresh Garlands crown'd their heads With Hyacinth and twineing Parsly drest, Grac't joyful Menelaus Marriage Feast; When lovely Helen great in conquering charms Resign'd her willing Beauty to his Arms: They danc't around, Joy flow'd from every tongue, And the vast Palace sounded with the Song: And why fair Bridegroom why so sleepy grown, And why to Bed e're shady Night comes on? What have you danct too much? Wine seiz'd your head, Or are you drowsy, that you must to Bed? But if you needs must sleep, then sleep alone, But why must Helen too your Bride be gone? Why must She leave her tender Mother thus? She should sit up, and play, and dance with us,
She should sit up till the bright Sun should rise, And Stars recede less beauteous than her eyes: For, Menelaus, She for all thy life For Morning, Night, and Noon must be thy Wife: O happy Bridegroom! Thee a lucky sneeze To Sparta welcom'd, where the youths of Greece Her chiefest Pride, did offer humble Love, Yet you were chose to be ally'd to Jove: A Beauty, such as never Greece did view, Now sleeps between the common Sheets with you: O happy Bridegroom, what thy Bride shall bear If like her self, it must be wondrous fair: Two hundred Spartan Maids, her Equalls We, That wrestled, fought, and ran as well as She, And e'en out did the Men; yet none appear A spotless Beauty if compar'd to Her: Just as the Morning shows her lovely face, When Winter's gone, and lazy Night withdraws, Just so doth Helen's charming Beauties rise, Tall, fair and fram'd by Nature to surprize: As Trees a Field, swift Steeds a Chariot grace, So Sparta is adorn'd by Helen's face: In all the Bride doth easily excell, None Spins with so much Art, none Weaves so well:
When She Diana or Minerva sings, None tunes so soft as She the speaking strings; That She, whose motions Charm, whose looks surprize, And Thousand Cupids wanton in her Eyes: Ah fair, ah lovely, of an envy'd life, Ah fair, and blest in being made a Wife; But we will run thro yonder spatious Mead, And crop flesh flowry Crowns to grace thy head; Mindful of Helen still, as tender Lambs Not wean'd as yet when hungry mind their Dams: We'l first low Lotus pluck, and Crowns compose And to thy Honor grace the shady Boughs, From Silver Boxes sweetest Oyls shall flow, And press the Flowers rhat rise as sweet below, And then inscribe this line, that all may see, Pay due Obedience, I am Helen's Tree: All Joy fair Bride, and happy Bridegroom joy, Let kind Latona give a lovely Boy, Let Venus, Goddess Venus mutual Love, And lasting Riches be bestow'd by Jove; That still they may descend, and grace the Throne From noble Father, to a noble Son: Sleep in each other Arms, and raise desire, Let ardent breathings fan your mutual Fire,
But rise betimes, forget not, we'l return When first the crowing Cock shall wake the Morn, When thro his feather'd throat He sends his voice: O Hymen, Hymen at this Feast rejoyce:
Idyllium XIX. On Love stung by a Bee. WHen Wanton Love design'd to theive, And steal the Hony from the Hive, An impious Bee his Finger stung, And thus reveng'd the proffer'd wrong; He blew his Fingers vext with pain, He stampt, and star'd but all in vain, At last unable to endure To Venus runs, and begs a cure; Complaining that so slight a touch And little thing should wound so much: She smil'd, and said, Son, Thou art like a Bee, Little, yet how great wounds are made by Thee!
Idyllium XX. A Shepherd complains of the coyness of a City Maid, who refus'd his proffer'd Kiss. To His good Humor'd Friend Mr. Alexander Crook of Wadham Colledge. EƲnica flouted me, She scorn'd my Kiss And when I proffer'd, answered with a hiss; Begon rough Shepherd thou dost ask invain, I faith I am not us'd to Kiss a Swain, The City Lips I press, and only them, Thou should not Kiss me, no, not in a Dream: How odd thy Courtship! and how dull thy jest! How languishing thy words, and how exprest! How soft and sweet thy voice! thy looks how fair! How smooth thy Chin! what Curls adorn thy Hair! Thy Lips are broken out, and black thy hand, Thy smell is rank, Bgon, I shall be stain'd. This said then thrice she spit, and view'd me round From head to foot, and mutter'd still, and frownd, Still scornfully she lookt, and mighty proud Of her fair Face, she sneerd, and laught aloud,
My blood began to boyl, my face was flusht, And, like a Rose with Dew o'recharg'd, I blusht: She left me streight, but I am vext at this That she proud Slut should flout, when I would Kiss: Am I not Handsome? tell me smiling Swains, For I was once the Beauty of the Plains, Tell me, have I no charms, no pleasing grace, Or hath some God oth' sudden chang'd my face? For I was handsome once, my Cheeks were red, My Beard like Ivy round an Oak was spread, And bushy hair like Parsly crown'd my head: My snowy forehead two black Eyebrows crost, My Eyes as grey as Palla's self could boast, My Mouth more sweet than Curds, my words did slow As smooth as Oyl, and soft as falling Snow: My Songs are charming, whilst my Flocks do feed I blow my Hougtboy, Pipe, or Oaten reed, Oft have I seen my Lambs forsake their grass And listning by with silent wonder gaze; And all the Country Maids my Face esteem, They kiss, and beg me I would stay with them: Are these small charms, that she should these despise? But I'me a Shepherd Swain, for that she flys, For that the City Maids refuse a Kiss,
Well, let them scorn, poor fools, they hardly know That beauteous Bacchus, fed a Herd below, Or that fair Venus wanton'd with a Swain, And fed his Cattle in the Phrygian Plain, With sweet Adonis oft she prov'd the Joy In Groves, in Groves she mourn'd the lovely Boy: Endymion was a Swain, he kept a flock, And yet for him the Moon her Skies forsook, She scorn'd a Scepter and embrac't a Crook: One Cave held both, with him she reapt delight, Came down, lay by, and kisst him all the night: E'en Rhea mourns a Swain, and mighty Jove Took Eagle's Wings, and bore a Swain above: A Swain this proud Eunica scorns alone, Better than Venus, Rhea, or the Moon: Venus, the fault was yours, you taught her pride, May, therefore, thine, thy Love be still deny'd; May you endure an injur'd Lover's pain, Ne're kiss thy Sweet, ne're wanton o're the Plain, But lye alone all night, and wish in vain.
Idyllium XXI. A discourse of two Fishermen upon a Dream. To Mr. Tho. Dunstar of Wadham Colledge. 'TIS Poverty, dear Friend, improves our Arts, It teaches Wit, and working thoughts imparts; For Cares chace Sleep from his laborious head Who sweats to earn, before he eats his bread: If lazy slumbers o're his eyes do creep, Streight noisy cares rush in, and break his sleep. Two good old Fishers slept, their bed was Sedge, Their Roof was Straw, their Walls a rotten Hedge, And round just by lay Baskets, Hooks, and Lines, Their Wiers, Sedgy Nets, their Rods, and Skins, Drawn up on some old Plank a tatter'd Boat, Their Pillow Straw, their Rugg a ragged Coat, Their Caps hung by upon a broken Oar, These were there tackling, and this all their store. Not one small Pot upon their Shelf was laid, All useless seem'd but what concern'd their trade; Thus blest they liv'd, and happy in content With their Companions, Poverty and Want:
No neighbour near, and every riseing tide Their Hovel reacht, and shook its tottering side: From midst of Heaven the Moon view'd all below, When dreams of Labor wakt the sleeping two; Each with his Thumb wip'd rest from off his Eyes, And sang, and cheer'd themselves with these replies: A. They lye, dear friend, that say the night decays When Summer comes, and Jove brings longer days; For I have seen a thousand dreams to night Long tedious dreams, and yet 'tis far from light; B. You blame the Summer, but unjustly blame, The Hours are still forc't on, their pace the same; But vexing Cares, that in a buisy throng Disturb your head, do make night seem so long: A. Can you interpret Dreams, Friend, tell me true, I've dreamt fine things, which I would tell to you: For that will ease me, and divert my Care, As we our Fish, so we our Dreams will share: B. Then tell thy friend. A. If you remember well We suppt too late, and made a spareing meal: On yonder shelving Rock methought I stood, And stoopt, intent upon the quiet flood; I saw the Fish, my Hook let gently down, And shook my cheating Bait to draw them on:
A great one bit, (for Fish is still my Theme, As Dogs of bones, so I of fishes dream) I strook, and hung him fast, I saw the Blood, The weight was great, I'me sure it bent the Rod; I strove to reach him, for my Line was weak, And faith, I fear'd my bending Hook would break, Dost prick me, for he prickt, I'le grasp the more, And so at last I drew my prey to shore; A golden Fish, I stood amaz'd, and feard 'Twas one of Neptune's own beloved herd: Or one of Sea green Amphitrite's train, A noble Fish, the treasure of the Main: I loos'd him gently, and did stricktly look That no small grain stuck round the rugged Hook: With Cords I drew him, and devoutly swore, That I would venture out to Sea no more; But stay at home, and make my self a King: At this I wakt, do you adjust the thing, Pray tell me what you think, for I'me afraid That I am bound to keep the Oath I made: B. Fear not, my friend, you did not swear, for why, You found no Fish, a Vision's but a lye: And therefore go, and draw the usual streams, Seek real Fish, no starve with golden dreams.
Idyllium XXII. A scorn'd Shepherd hangs himself, the cruel fair is kill'd by the Statue of Cupid. To Mr. Rily Painter to his Majesty. AN Amorous Shepherd lov'd a charming Boy, As fair thought could frame, or wish enjoy, Unlike his Soul, illnatur'd and unkind, An Angells body with a Fury's mind: How great a God Love was, He scorn'd to know, How sharp his arrows, and how strong his bow, What rageing wounds he scatters here below. In his address and talk fierce, rude, untame, He gave no comfort to the Shepherd's flame: No cherry Lips, no Rose his Cheeks did dye, No pleasing Fire did sparkle in his Eye, Where eager thoughts with fainting Vertue strove, No soft discourse, nor Kiss to ease his Love: But as a Lion on the Lybian Plain Looks on his Hunters, he beheld the Swain: His Lips still pouting, and his Eyes unkind, His Forehead too was rough as was his Mind; His Colour gone, and every pleasing Grace Beset by fury had forsook his face:
Yet midst his passion, midst his frowns he mov'd, As these were Charms He was the more belov'd: But when or'e come he could endure no more, He came and wept before the hated door, He wept and pin'd, he hung his sickly head, The threshold kisst, and thus at last he said: Ah cruel fair, and of a Tigress born! Ah stony Boy, compos'd of frowns and scorn: Unworthy of love, this Rope receive, The last, and wellcomst Present I can give: I'le never vex thee more, I'le cease to wo And whether you condem'd freely go, Where certain Cures for Love, as Stories tell, Where dismal shades, and dark Oblivion dwell: Yet did I drink the whole forgetful Stream, It would not drown my Love, nor quench my flame: Thy cruel doors I bid my last Adieu, Know what will come; and you shall find it true: The Day is fair but quickly yields to shades, The Lilly white, but when 'tis pluck it fades: The Violet lovely, but it withers soon, Youths beauty charming, but tis quickly gone: The time shall come when you, proud Boy, shall prove The heat of Passion, and the rage of Love: Then shall thy Soul melt thro thy weeping Eye, Whilst all shall smile, and you unpitty'd dye.
Yet grant one kindness, and I ask no more, When you shall see me hanging at the door Do not go proudly by, forbear to smile, But stay, sweet Boy, and gaze, and weep a while; Then take me down, and whilst some tears are shed, Thy own soft garment o're my body spread, And grant one Kiss, one Kiss when I am dead: Nere fear, for you may safely grant me this, shan't revive tho you could Love, and Kiss: Then dig a Grave, there let my Love be laid, And when you part, say thrice, my friend is dead, Or else go farther on to please my Ghost, And cry, my best, my dearest friend is lost: And on my Monument inscribe this Rhime, The witness of my Love and of thy Crime, This Shepherd dy'd for Love, stay Stranger here, And weep, and cry, He lov'd a cruel fair: This said, he roll'd a Stone, a mighty Stone, Fate lent a hand behind, and pusht it on: High by the Wall, on this he panting rose, And ty'd, and sitted well the fatal noose: Then from the place on which before he stood He slipt, and hung the Door's unhappy load: The Boy came forth, and with a scornful Meine And smileing look beheld the tragick Scene;
Hang there said He, but O how I despise So base, so mean a Trophy of my Eyes! The proudest Kings should fall by my disdain, Too noble to be lost upon a Swain: This said, he turn'd, and as he turn'd his head His Garments were polluted by the Dead, Thence to the Plays and to the Baths did move, The Bath was sacred to the God of Love; For there he stood in comely Majesty Smiles on his Cheeks, and softness in his Eye, That part of th' Marble wrought into his Breast By Power divine was softer than the rest, To show how Pitty did exactly suit With Love, and was his darling Atribute: The God leapt forth, and dasht the Boy, the Wound Let out his Soul, and as it fled He groan'd. Hail Lovers, hail, see here the scornful dyes, A just, and acceptable Sacrifice, Be kind, and Love for mutual Love return, For see the God takes vengeance on my scorn.
Idyllium XXIII. Hercules in his Cradle kills two Serpents which Juno sent to destroy him &c. To Mr. William Latton of Wadham Colledge. ALcides ten months old, a vigorous Child, Alcmena fed, and laid him on a Shield, (The Shield from Pterilus Amphitryo won A great auspicious Cradle for his Son;) With younger Iphiclus of human race, No part of him was drawn from Jove's embrace: On either head her tender hands she laid, And with a Mother's fondness thus she said; Sleep, sleep, dear Children, sleep, be free from pain, Rest well to night, to morrow wake again: This said she stopt, and rockt the sounding Shield, Iphiclus wept, and young Alcides smil'd: Sleep seiz'd on both: Now Mid-night's shade came on, The flying Bear in hast was tumbling down, And broad Orion's Shoulder did appear With's Sword, as still pursueing of the Bear; When wily Juno full of envious hate Drove on two dreadful Serpents to the Gate,
She forc't the Doors, and shew'd the Open way Designing young Alcides For their prey: Their Scaly trains roll'd o're the trembling floor, Their fiery Eyes shot sulphurous flames before, And from their Jaws dropt clods of Putrid gore: When near they roll'd, and did the Infants touch, E'en Sleep it self streight fled at their approach, The Children wak't, and, by Jove's order, light Shot thro the gloomy darkness of the Night: Iphiclus cry'd as soon as he beheld The Snakes twist round, and gapeing o're the Shield, He kickt the Cloaths, and tost, for flight prepar'd, As if he meant to shun the Fate he fear'd: But young Alcides stretcht his Infant hands, And graspt the rolling Snakes with fatal bands, He seiz'd their swelling throats, where stor'd by Fate Their Poyson lies, which e'en the Gods do hate: In that Death dips her darts, then takes her rounds, And on frail Mortals scatters certain wounds: Each twisted round the Babe a dreadful fold, But still he graspt, and took the firmer hold, The Babe, not wean'd as yet, in Mind a Man, He show'd his Race as soon as he began: In's Nurses Arms he ne're was heard to cry, No tear e're dropt from his unwilling Eye:
At last tir'd out they both extended lay, The Infants spoyl, his first auspicious prey: Alcmena's Ears first heard the tender crys, She started first, and said Amphytrio, rise; Rise, rise, thy aid a sudden danger calls, Do'st hear how loud the younger Infant bawls? Do'st see these Walls shine with unusual light, For yet the Morning hath not chac't the Night; There's some strange thing, there is, Rise, rise my Dear, From Danger free thy Babes, thy Wife from Fear: She spake, Amphitryo rose, such hast he show'd As nimble Lightning from a breaking Cloud, He snatcht his Sword, which o're his valiant head Hung allways fastned to the Cedar bed, A strong Belt held it, tough, and neatly made, He graspt the Sheath, and drew the flameing Blade; When streight the light withdrew its wondrous rays, In darkness left him; and in wild amaze: Still startled more, Lights Slaves, Slaves Lights, he cryes, Lights Slaves, deep sleep sat heavy on their Eyes: Lights Maids, They heard, and quick as the command, A flameing Torch now shone in every hand, They all rush in; with troubled hast they come, And buisy throngs streight fill the crouded Room:
But when they saw two Snakes twist round the Child They shreikt, and wept; the young Alcides smil'd: Held out the Snakes, pleas'd with the guilded sight, Laught at his own success, and their affright; Disdain'd those Foes that with such ease He slew, And at his Fathers feet the Monsters threw: Half dead Iphiclus on her tender brest Alcmena clapt, and lull'd him into rest: The other Babe on Skins of slaughter'd sheep Amphitryo laid, and then return'd to sleep; When thrice the Cock had Crow'd to wake the Sun, Alcmena starting from her Bed of Down Tiresias call'd, from whom Truth always fell, Scarce Phoebus knew the mind of Fate so well: She told the tale, and said, thrice reverend Seer Explain the meaning, I' me prepar'd to hear: Nor yet to pleasure me conceal the doom, Or bad or good, what Fate hath wove must come: Thus spake the Queen, and thrice his reverend Head Tiresias shook, and thus at last he said: Hail mighty Queen, the pride of Person's blood, Happy, and Mother of a future God: The time shall come as years bring round the days, When Grecian Maids shall sing Alcmena's praise, And as they weave, or whirl their Spindle roud From every tongue Alcmena's name shall sound;
The Grecians goddess thou shalt grace a shrine, So great thy Son shall be, and so divine! A generous Hero he shall mount on high, The noblest burthen of the bending Sky: To Him all Monsters, and all Men must yield, The Tyrant's Scourge, and the Oppressed's Shield▪ Twelve labors pass'd he shall the Skies enjoy, When Oeta's flames have purg'd the base alloy: Be call'd their Son in Law, appease their Hate Who rais'd these Snakes, and sent them to his Fate. Then Woolves shall see young Fawns approach their Den, And let them part unhurt, and safe again, So great a Scourge he shall to Monsters prove, And shed such Influence from his Seat above: But Queen observe, and let a Pile be made, Green Oaks, and Ash, and Birch in order laid: Then cut these Snakes, observe the time they came To eat the Babe, and burn them o're the flame: At morning peep soon quench the blazeing wood, And scatter all the Ashes o're the flood, And thence return, but with a steddy pace, Nor look behind on the polluted place: Then let pure Brimstone purge the Rooms, and bring Clear Fountain water from the sweetest Spring;
This mixt with Salt, with blooming Olives crown'd, Spread o're the Floor, and purge polluted ground: Then kill a Bore to Jove, that free from harms The Child may live, and Victory crown his Arms. This said, he bow'd, and with a staggering gate For years oppress't him, reacht his Ivory Seat. And now the Boy, his Mother's pride, was grown Like riseing Oaks, and thought Amphitryo's Son: In Letter's Linus did his Mind enlarge, A generous Hero, watchful of his charge: Eumolpus tun'd his manly voice to sing, And taught his hand to strike the tuneful string: Eurytus famous for his vast Estate To draw the Bow, and shoot as sure as Fate: To Leap, to Wrestle and to throw the Dart He learn't from fierce Autolycus's Art, Sweet Herme's Son who when he fought his Foe None dar'd, tho distant, to behold his Brow: Such frightful fierceness did in's looks appear And shot thro the amaz'd Spectators fear: To drive the Chariot, and with steddy skill To turn, and yet not break the bending Wheel Amphitryo kindly did instruct his Son; Great in that Art, for he himself had won
Vast pretious prizes on the Argive Plains, And still the Chariot, which he drove, remains, For nought but eating Time could break his Reins; To weild his Sword, and to assault his Foe, To use his Shield, and shun the comeing blow, To order Battles, and to raise their force, Close Ambush lay, and lead the furious Horse, Stout Castor taught, when he from Argos fled, Basely deserted by the force he led, When Tydeus Arms the fatal Conquest won, And forc't the weak Adrastus from his Throne: Few of the Heroes equall'd him in Fight E're trembling Age had put strong Youth to flight: Thus grew the Boy his Mother's care and pride, His bed was rais'd by his great Father's side, Spread with a Lion's Skin, whose Jaws affright The weaker Youths, but were this Boys delight: When young he often would unsheath their Paws, And use his tender Hands to break their Jaws; And when one Tooth was broke, with smiles would meet, And cast his Trophies at his Mother's feet: His food was roasted flesh, his loaf was great, As large as e'en a labouring Swain could eat:
A spareing Meal, and unprepar'd at night, His Cloaths were made for covering, not delight: Thus hardly bred the mighty Hero grew, Well fitted for the wonders He must do. Imperfect in the Greek.
Idyllium XXIV. A Dialogue between Daphnis and a Shepherdess. To Thomas Powel of Wadh. Col. Esquire. D. PAris a Herdsman Helen stole, tis said, And she that kisst me is as fair a Maid: S. Pride not thy self, what empty thing's a Kiss! D. And yet that empty thing is full of Bliss; S. I wash my mouth, and thus thy Kiss disdain; D. Dost wash my Dear? then come, let's Kiss again: S. Swain thou shouldst kiss thy Heifer, not a Maid: D. Don't scorn, thy youth, like dreams, will quickly fade, S. The Grape, when dry, grows Raisin, and is priz'd. Nor is the Rose, tho wither'd, soon despis'd: D. Come to these Shades, I've tales ne're told before S. Once your sweet tongue deceiv'd, I'le trust no more. D. Go with me to those Elms, and here my Flute, S. Go please thy self, I hate so harsh a note: D. Let fear of Venus anger seize thy mind, S. A fig for Venus, if Diana's kind; D. Ah speak not thus lest she should fix her Chain, The noose is strong, and you may strive invain.
S. Ay, let her do't, I live Diana's care, And she shall quickly free me from her Snare, Hands off Rude Swain, I vow I'le scratch, forbear, D. You must not scape, no Maid e're scap't Loves stroke, S. I'le scape, by Pan, but thou shallt bear his Yoke; D. To meaner Swains I fear you will be kind, S. Many have woo'd, none yet e're pleas'd my Mind: D. And I am one that woo, and would obtain: S. What shall I do? Marriage is full of pain, D. Not grief and pain, but Joy attends the Bed; S. Sure I have heard that Wives their Husbands dread: D. No, no, they rule, for what should Weomen fear? S. Child-birth is hard, and I'me afraid to bear: D. No fear, o're that thy own Diana reigns, And gives a speedy ease to Mother's pains: S. Yet I'me affraid, should many Births prevail My Beauty fades, and then your Love may fail: D. Yet should you bear fine Boys, a Happy Wife, How would you look into a future Life! S. But come, what Joynture, Swain, if I should yeild; D. My Flocks, my Herds, my Woods, and all my Field: S. Swear then, lest when enjoy'd you false should prove, D. Never by Pan, if you'l consent to Love: S. Will you a Bed, a House, and Meat provide? D. All this shall be the Dowry of my Bride?
Look, all these Flocks are mine, I'le still be true, And promise you no more than I can do: S. What shall I say when my old Friends shall blame? D. They'l like the Marriage when they hear my name: S. Then tell thy name, for names do often please, D: Daphnis, my Father's joy, and Mother's ease; His name is Lycidas the noble Swain, Her's Neme, once the Beauty of the Plain: S. Thy race is noble, but yet mine's as good, D. But no ways better, for in yonder Wood Menalcas lives, the Fountain of thy Blood. S. Show me thy Grove, and where thy Sheep-Coat lies: D. These are my Trees, look how my Cypress rise; S. Feed Goats, whilst I attend the Herdman's Love, D. Feed Bulls, I go to show the Maid my Grove: S. Rude Swain, what means your hand upon my breast? D. The Cluster's ripe, and sueing to be presst: Those I must pluck; oh! with what Heat they move! And how they rise at every touch of Love! S. I quake, pull out your hand, rude Swain, forbear; D. Cheer up, no harm, how timerous is my Dear! S. 'Tis Dirty, ah! look there, twill stain my Gown, And tell my jealous friends what I have done: D. I'le spread my Jerkin, 'tis a scurvy place But 'me content to pay for the embrace:
S. Forbear, we shall be caught, I hear a noise, D. Tis nought but Trees that murmur at our joys; S. You tear my Coat, ah me, I am undone. D. I'le buy a larger, and a better Gown: S. You promise all things now, but, when enjoy'd, What willt thou give? Love's gone when Lust is cloy'd: You will deceive, you Men are all deceit, And we so willing to believe the cheat: D. O, could I give my Soul, what Oaths can do Ile bind; I must, I cannot but be true: S. I yeild, forgive Diana, O forgive, I liv'd thy Votary, but no more can live: D. Pleas'd, Ravisht, O, I'le kill in yonder Grove A Steer to Venus; and a Bull to Love: S. I'me Woman grown that was a Maid before, D. A teeming Woman, and a Maid no more: Thus murmuring they did their soft Heats improve, And went, and knew the Mystery of Love: She rose, and smil'd, and banist Modesty Regain'd her Seat, and sate upon her Eye: Yet secret Pleasure thro her looks appear'd; And joyful Daphnis went, and fed his Herd.
Idyllium XXV. A short account of the Death of Pentheus the Theban King, whom his Mother and Aunts tore in Pieces for disturbing the Solemnities of Bacchus. To Mr. Dring of Wadh. Col. I NO, the fierce Autonoe, and the fair Agau three Thyrsi to the Hills did bear, In number Three; they pluckt wild Oaks and Bays, And in plain Fields did twelve green Altars raise; With Ivy shaded, and adorn'd with Vine, Fair Semele had Three, and Bacchus Nine, Bacchus the Weomen's God, and Mens delight, These take at Day, and those receive at Night: From Baskets then those sacred gifts they made They gladly took, and on the Altar laid, Mysterious gifts, to please the wondrous God, And Honor him the way that he had show'd: Young Pentheus lay in shady Hills conceal'd, And from the Rock the wondrous rites beheld, Autonoë spy'd him first, and cry'd aloud, See their the great Contemner of the God;
And out she ran, and as she went o'rethrew The sacred rites, which no profane must view: She first grew mad, then all the rest were fir'd, Their Fury rose as High as Rage inspir'd: Young Pentheus fled when he their madness view'd, They tuckt their Coats and eagerly pursu'd: He cry'd, what mean the Weomen? Oh forbear! Wretch you shall feel, they answerd, e're you hear: His Mother seiz'd, and snatcht his Head away, And roar'd, as a fierce Tigress o're her prey, Ino stampt on his Breast, his Arm she tore, And fierce Autonoe reekt with royal gore: Others seiz'd other Limbs, each snatcht a part, And every hand reacht forward to his heart: This done they shouted, and ran madly down, And bore the bloody Trophies to the Town: Deserv'd: Let none his Mighty Power offend, Lest greater mischiefs, and vast pains attend, Let me be good, Let me the just approve, For this is pleasing, and the care of Jove: For Pious Fathers on their Sons derive Sure blessings, which the Impious cannot give; They live themselves still vext with sharp remorse, And leave a long Hereditary Curse:
Hail Bacchus Hail, whom snatcht from Destiny Great Jove secur'd, and foster'd in his Thigh: Hail Semele, and all his Sisters hail, Whose fame resounds thro every Grecian vale: Their Act was just that did reward the Sin, They showd the Votary, and put off the Kin: Take heed Profane, by this Example showd, For what the Gods inspire must needs be good.
Idyllium XXVI. An advice to a Friend to be constant in his Love. To Charles Viner of Wadham Colledge, Esquire. WIne, Friend, and Truth, the Proverb says, agree, And now I'me heated take this Truth from me; The Secrets that lay deep and hid before Now rais'd by Wine swim up, and bubble o're; Then take this riseing Truth I ca'nt controul, Thou dost not Love Me, Youth, with all thy Soul; I know it, for this half of Life I boast I have from you, the other half is lost: When e're you smile I rival Gods above, Grown perfect, and exalted by thy Love; But when you frown, and when dislike you show, I sink to Hell, more curst than all below; Yet how can this with common sense agree To torture one that loves, and dyes for Thee? But Youth, could my Advice thy thoughts engage, Mine who have learn'd Experience by my Age, The Counsell's good, and when a numerous store Of Blessings Crown Thee, Thou wilt praise me more:
On one Tree build one Nest, and build it strong, Where no fierce Snake can creep, and seize thy young: Now here you stand, and suddenly are gone, You leap from Bough to Bough, and fix on none. If any views thy Beauty, and Commends, You streight enroll him midst your antient friends, Whilst all your old Acquaintance laid aside, Dear youth this smells of Vanity and Pride: Love One, your Equal, love whilst Life remains, This pleases all, and Commendation gains, By this your Passion will but light appear Which conquers all, and all are forc't to bear; Love seizes all; and doth all Minds controul, It melts the stubborn temper of my Soul; But O I must embrace, Dear, grant one Kiss, And thus reward, and practise my Advice.
Idyllium XXVII. The Bore that kill'd Adonis is brought before Venus. To William Kenrick of Wadham Colledge, Esquire. WHen Venus saw Adonis dead, His Cheeks all pale, and beauty fled, His Hair grown stiff with clotted gore, And now to be belov'd no more, She bad her Cupids trace the Grove, And bring the Bore that kill'd her Love: They, quick as the Command, ran o're The Wood, and found the hated Bore, They seiz'd, and bound, strong Cords they twin'd, Some drew before, some drove behind, One twirld his Tail to make him go, Another lasht him with his Bow: The fearful Beast went trembling on, As conscious of the deed he done, His hanging looks his guilt betray'd Of Venus Fury much affraid:
When come, Her rage these words exprest: Thou vilest Monster of a Beast, Were these the cruel Tusks did tear? Wast Thou the ruine of my Dear? The Bore, reply'd, By thee, thy Love, By All that's kind, and apt to move, By what I suffer, by these chains, And these that drive me to my pains, I ne're had a design to kill Thy Fair, it was against my Will: But when I saw his naked Thigh As white as polisht Ivory, How did my Flame and Fury rise! How was I fir'd at the surprize! At last unable to resist Ah me! too furiously I kisst, And this the Boys destruction brought, And Love betray'd me to a fault: These Tusks destroy, and punish these The curst disturbers of thy ease, For why should I have leave to prove These Tusks that have no use in Love: Or if the crime demands no less These Lips I offer to appease:
These words so moveingly exprest Calm'd all the Fury of her Breast, She soon forgave, releast her Foe, And bad her Cupids let him go, But he ne're sought Woods again, But staid attending on her train; And to the Funeral Pile he came, And burnt his Tusks in the devouring flame.
Idyllium XXVIII. He presents a Distaff to Theeugnis his Friend Nicias his Wife. To Mr. Charles Whiteing of Wadham Colledge. DIstaff, thou greatest gift on Man bestow'd By fair Minerva as the chiefest good, Whom wise and thrifty Weomen still retain, And raise their Husband's fortune by their pain, Retire with me to Nileu's beauteous Town, Where stately shrines grace Venus and her Son, For thither, Distaff, I am now design'd, And beg of mighty Jove a prosperous wind, To be enjoy'd by, and enjoy my Friend: Nicias, in whom the sweet tongu'd Graces rest, Learning it self is seated in his Breast, There thou of polisht Ivory fram'd shalt prove, A grateful present to his dearest Love; From thee shall all her Husband's Vests be spun, From thee She'l often draw a flowry Gown; For Lambs do loose their Fleeces twice a year To fill her Baskets, and be wrought by her:
So painful is Theeugnis, what the wise And thrifty Matrons value, She will prize: Nor would I send thee to an idle place Thou product of our Country, and our grace; For thou wert made where Walls stout Archias fram'd, The Pride of Sicily, for valour fam'd: Now thou shalt visit him whose wondrous skill Can save the Men that Fate designs to kill, Whose Herbs can soon restore a life when lost, And by his Art bring back the flying Ghost: That fair Theeugnis may by all be known To have the neatest Distaff in the Town; And still of me her friend kind thoughts infuse, Of me the chiefest Darling of the Muse: There some shall see thee, and these words repeat, The present's small, but yet the kindness great, The Giver's Love doth little Gifts commend, And every thing is valued from a Friend.
Idyllium XXIX. Hercules going to Augias meets a Herdsman, of whom he asks the usual questions which a Stranger makes, and re∣ceives satisfaction: and is afterward brought to the King and his Son Phyleus, who were then in the Fields; By those he is invited to the Town, and in the way tells Phyleus how he had kill'd the Nemean Lion. To Mr. Thomas Piggot of Wadham Colledge. Imperfect in the Greek. AND then the Herdsman, from his labouring hand He threw his work, thus answer'd his demand: I'le gladly tell what e're thy mind desires, This Justice craves, and Mercury requires; For he of all the Gods resents it most, When we deny a Stranger what is just: Look, Stranger, all the numerous Herds around With which the Vales are fill'd, and Hills are crown'd, King Augias owns; o're thousand Plains they spread, In different Meads, and various Pastures fed, Some on the flowry Banks of Eli stray, And some where smooth Alpheus eats his way;
Some midst the Vines in fair Boupraisium go, Some here, the Vallies tremble when they Low: For each of these the King fair Stalls hath rear'd, Tho numerous, large, and equal to the Herd: And here fresh Grass still cloaths the fruitful Plain, The Blades, as soon as cropt, arise again, For Springs cut thro the Plain, and feed the Grass, All fit to fatten Oxen, and increase: Look, on thy right hand far beyond the Flood The Stall appears between the shady Wood, Next where wild Olives, and high Planes do grow; Apollo's shrine, to whom the Herdsmen bow, And own the greatest Deity below. Next are the Farmer's Stalls, whose Labors bring Whole Streams of gain, and much inrich the King, For thrice they Plow, thrice sow the teeming soil, Which still invites, and still rewards their toil: Many large Vineyards plant, his Vines they dress▪ And sweaty Autum treads the flowing Press: For all these Gardens, Feilds, and Plains around Till yonder watry Hills the compass bound, King Augias owns, and here all day we bear The Heat and Cold, and urge the weighty share:
But Sir, (for I no common Aaid may prove) What Buisness led you to this happy Grove, Would you the King, or any Servant See, I can direct you, you shall learn from Me: For sure you seem, if well I make your face, Great in your self, and noble in your race; How brave you look! and what a Port you bear! So look the Sons of Gods when they appear: This said he bow'd, and Jove's stout Son reply'd, Swain, Generous, free from Savageness or Pride, I seek the King whom all these Realms obey, Buisness with him first drew my Feet this way, If midst his Subjects now he keeps the Town, Divideing Justice from his equal Throne, Give me a Swain to guide, a Master Swain, Who when I ask can answer me again, For Man is made to be a help to Man: Thus spake Alcides, Thus the Swain reply'd, Sir, all the way some God your feet must guide, So luckily things happen, so conspire To please your Mind, and answer your desire: Last night King Augias and his valiant Son Young Phyleus left the hurry of the Town, They came to spend some days midst peaceful Swains, And view their wondrous riches on the Plains,
This Pains some Princes take, they leave their ease, For when they watch themselves their Stores encrease: When with Heaven's Providence they joyn their own, A double guard secures their safer Throne, But come, let's go, and both the Prince attend, In yonder Stall, He'l love so great a Friend: This said he hastned to conduct his guest, His wonder still at every step encreast; His Lions Skin, vast Club, his Mein and Face Still hightned, still he wonder'd what he was; Oft he would ask, but yet as oft represt The riseing Query in his troubled Breast, Lest it should seem too rude, and ill design'd, For, O, 'tis hard to know another's Mind! Whilst yet far off the faithful Mastiffs knew The noise and smell of both, and out they flew: From every part they at the Hero run With open mouths, resolv'd to tear him down: But round the Swain they wagg'd their tails, and play'd; And in hoarse murmurs savage joy betray'd: He stoopt to take up stones, they stopt their noise, He spoke, they fear'd the thunder of his voice: All silent fled, but yet the Swain was glad To see his Mastiffs care, and thus he said: What useful Creatures are these Dogs to Man!
How full of care! how useful to a Swain! Had they but reason to know whom to tear, And whom to love, what Creature could compare! But now they'r Bruitish, then he cry'd, begone; Each took his Stall▪ and lay in quiet down: Now down the West with a descending ray Bright Phoebus drove, and bore declineing day: Now shades drew on, and full of Milk and food; The Sheep came home, and lay and chewd the Cud: Next these the Cows and Oxen fill'd the Plain, As thick as Clouds when Jove descends in rain: When watry Southwinds bring their Treasures forth, Or when They'r hudled by the stormy North: No man can count them, for so fast they rise, And follow one another thro the Skies, Still new and new the driveing tempest brings, And bears vast burthens on his weary Wings: These Herds a Herdsman drove, the fields, and road Were  the vallies sounded when they low'd: The Sta were crouded, and could scarce contain, And Sp lay round, and bleated o're the Plain: Th ousand Slaves stood round of every kind, Noe wanted work, all had their Tasks assign'd: One shackled starting Cows, and whilst they stood He milk'd, and streight the largest Pail o'reflow'd:
One let the Calves to suck, they soon were fill'd With sweetest Milk, such stores the Cows did yield: Some bore the Pails, and some did run the Cheese Hot from the Cow, some rais'd the Wring to squeeze, And some the Bulls apart from Heifers drove, They turn'd and bellow'd, eager on their Love: The King himself went round to every Herd, To see what Calves his Servants Care had rear'd: And whilst thro his vast Stores he trac'd the Plain, His Son and great Alcides made his train; Here tho our Hero's Soul great Shows despis'd, Was constant, fixt, too brave to be surpriz'd, Yet now at last his wonder rose to view, Such numerous Herds, and scarce could think 'twas true, That One such stores should have, that could suffice Ten Kings, and fill capacious Avarice: But this was a peculiar favour shown, A Blessing sent by Phoebus on his Son, His Cattle still must thrive, his Herds be blest, And Heaven secur'd what e're the King possest: His Cows ne're cast their Calves, and no disease, The Herdsman's plague, was e're allow'd to seize: From year to year the numerous Herd encreast New Calves were rear'd, and still the last were best,
Three hundred Bulls, turn'd Horns grace every head, Their legs were white, with these two hundred red, All leapt the Cows, begot a numerous race, And soon supply'd frail Nature's chance-decays, Apart from these twelve mighty Bulls did run, As white as Snow, and sacred to the Sun; Each with his shape might tempt the Tyrian Queen, They fed, were pleas'd, and wanton'd o're the Green: And when fierce Lions from the Woods appear'd They turn'd to fight, and still secur'd the Herd, They bellow'd low'd, they tore the trembling ground, And with bent foreheads aim'd a double wound: Midst these one Bull did far ecel the rest, Call'd Phaeton, a stout and mighty Beast This name the Herdsman gave deduc't from light, For his quick Courage, and his strength in fight; He all excell'd, was stately, valiant, fair, As much as Phaeton the meanest Star: The Lion's Skin, that o're the Hero spread As soon as first he saw, he bent his head, And ran to push, he quickly shun'd the wound, His left Horn grasp't, and pull'd him to the ground, Invain he strove, invain he spurn'd the Sand, With doubled strength the Hero fixt his hand,
Then urg'd his breast, and forc't the Bull to rear On high, and held him Beating in the Air: The King, his valiant Son, and all the Plain Admir'd his strength, and thought him more than Man: The Prince and Hero now dark shades grew on, The Meadows left, and hastned to the Town: They took a path which from the distant Stall Thro Vine-yards led, and thro a pleasing vale, Twas little beaten, thro a shady Grove A soft and cool retreat for happy Love, No heavy Clowns came there whose weighty tread Might spoyl the verdure of the grassy bed: And as they walkt with a Majestick look Young Phyleus turn'd his head, and thus he spoke: Sir, if I guess aright, your sounding Fame Hath reacht my Ears, tho 't has not told your name, For one an Argive, valiant, stout and young From Aelis came, and pleas'd the listning throng He said, whilst he was there, and vow'd 'twas true, A valiant Greek a furious Lion slew, Strong, cruel, bloody, that destroy'd the Swains, The fierce Nemean Terror of the Plains; But whether Argos his great Birth could boast Or Sparta gave, my Memory hath lost;
But yet he said, tho I forget the place, For that I mind, he was of Perseus race; You, Sir, I hope are he, the man that fought, This Skin proclaims as much, and clears my doubt: But pray inform me, 'twill afford delight And please me much if I conjecture right, Tell me if you are he, the brave, the bold, Of whom the Argive's wondrous tale was told; Tell how the Lion fell, what strokes he stood, And how he came to the Nemean Wood, For did you seek it, you would seek invain For such a Monster on the Grecian Plain, She breeds no such, the Bear, the Woolf, and Bore, Unlucky Beasts, she breeds, and breeds no more; Hence some admire, and some the tale accuse As if contrived to please, and to amuse: This said he bow'd, and stept aside to show The Path was large, and wide enough for two; He beg'd the Hero to advance more near, That they might speak with greater ease, and hear, He soon came forward, and whilst side by side They walkt, he to his question thus reply'd Brave Augias Son, what e're the Prince hath said Is right, and his conjecture duly weigh'd, Yet I'le inform you how the Monster fell,
And whence it came, for very few can tell; But most imagine 'twas design'dly sent To prove the base Pheroneans punishment, Neglect of Duty had provokt a God: The poor Piseans like a headlong flood He ravag'd o're and drown'd their Fields in Blood: But most the Bembinaeans felt his rage, And lingred out a miserable Age, This task Eurystheus, whom I must obey, Impos'd, and hop'd to see me prove the Lion's prey: I took my Bow, my Hollow Quiver bore Sharp Arrows arm'd with the Lernean gore, When e're I draw a shaft Deaths wait around To guide the Dart, and enter at the wound: My left hand graspt my Club, strong, knotty, rude, With all its Bark, unpolisht from the Wood; It grew on Helicon, I pluckt it thence With Roots and all, and weild for my Defence: Approaching to the Wood, I bent my Bow, My Arrow knockt, and wisht to meet my Foe, I lookt around, and try'd, prepar'd for fight, To spy the Beast, and take advantage of the sight, 'Twas midday now, and yet no Beast appear'd, No track was seen, nor any roaring heard, No Herdsman, Swain, that might his Den declare,
All lay at home chain'd up with slavish fear: But still I trac't the Groves, thro Woods I prest, Resolv'd at last to find and fight the Beast: For every Evening glutted with the Blood Of slaughter'd Beasts he took the shady Wood; His Maine was stiff with gore, his grisly Beard His long Tongue lickt with Blood and foam besmear'd; Behind a Thicket I impatient lay And wisht each Minute was the Close of day, That I might see him; Lo at last he came, In look as dreadful as he was in fame; I drew my Bow, and shot, the String did sound, And Death stood ready to attend the wound, But from his side the Shaft rebounding fell, And prov'd the hardned Beast was arm'd too well: The Lion roar'd, he rais'd his furious Head And lookt to see from whence the Arrow fled, His flameing Eyes shot Fire, unsheath'd his Paws, He gap't, and Teeth lookt dreadful in his Jaws: I knockt another Arrow, drew again, Inrag'd to see the former shot invain: The Breast it strook where Life maintains her Seat, And labouring Lungs still fan the vital Heat: But that invain did from his Breast rebound,
And rais'd his Fury only, not a wound: A third I drew, but e're I aim'd aright; The Beast perceiv'd me, and prepar'd for fight: His Tail twirl'd round, his Neck was swoln with Rage, And every Limb seem'd eager to engage, His Mane stood up, his fiery Eyes did glow, And Crooked Back was bent into a Bow: And as when Wheelers take a sturdy Oak, Or Elm, and Bath it in the glowing smoak, To make a Wheel, at first it bends, and stands And then at once leaps from their grasping Hands: So leapt the Beast at me, such Springs as these He made, grown eager and resolv'd to seize: But I receiv'd him, in my left I held My Darts, and a thick garment was my Shield, My Right did weild my Club, and aim'd a Blow, As He was leaping forward, at his Brow, A lucky blow, but on the hardned bones It broke, the Lion sigh'd in hollow groans; Some steps retir'd, as if all Sense was sled, And stood with shakeing Legs, and dizzy'd head: Mists seiz'd his Eyes, and an amazeing pain Ran thro the crazy Vessels of his Brain: This I observ'd, and now an easy prey
I threw my Quiver and my shafts away And seiz'd his Neck; and whilst his Sense was gone I grip'd him hard, and kept the Lion down; My Gpes dbled, and ehind I prest, Lest  aws should tear my adverse Breast, On's hnde  I , and squeez'd his Thighs With mine,  spurn'd invain and strove to rise: At last o'recome when he  strove invain He lay extended o the aal Plain, I held him breathless, did his force controul, And gapeing Hell receiv'd his mighty Soul: Then next I sought how I might gain the Spoyls, And with his pretious Skin reward my toyls; The task was hard, for neither Wood, nor Stone, Nor Steel could pierce, and make the Skin my own: But then some God did happy thoughts infuse, The Paws he shew'd, and taught me those to use: I did, and flead him, and the Hide I bear To be my strong security in War: Thus fell the Beast by which such numbers fell, And fled amidst his slaughter'd Heaps to Hell.
Idyllium XXX. The Fight between Amycus and Pollux: This Amycus being excellently well skill'd at Whirlebats, made a De∣cree that whatever Stranger came into his Country should fight with him; after he had slain a great many, Pollux at last overcomes him. To Mr. Robert D' oyly of Wadham Colledge. FAir Leda's Sons and mighty Jove's I sing Castor and Pollux Glories of the Ring, None toss their Whirlebats with so brave a force, None guide so well the Fury of their Horse, With trebled Songs I sing the glorious Two, The great supports and helps of Man below, When midst destructive Wars swift dangers press, Or stormy Stars send Tempests o're the Seas; They toss the Floods, and raise the swelling Tide At Poop or Prow, and dash on either side, Or pour into the Ship, the Planks and Masts Are torn, nor can the Sails endure the Blasts, But rent hang useless; Storms of Hail and Rain From Heaven descend, and beat the Spatious Main:
The Waters roar, the Troubled Ocean raves Whilst Hail and Stormy Winds do beat the Waves Yet then you draw the Ship from deepest Seas, And those that look'd for Death are cheer'd with ease; The Clouds all fly and Storms strickt silence keep, And a smooth Calmness spreads o're all the Deep: Bright Stars appear, and with a beauteous ray Presage good voyages, and shew the way: Great helps to Man, of Both my Muse must write Both skill'd in Horses, singing, and in fight, But Muse, whose Praises must I first reherse? Sing Both, first Pollux grace thy sounding Verse: When Argo's Sails had scap't the closeing Shores, And swept cold Pontus with her nimble Oars, She toucht Bebryca, forc't by prosperous fate, The Sons of Gods and Heroes were her freight: And there they landed; when they came to land Some rais'd Grass-beds, and by their Lords command Some drest their Meat upon the naked Sand: Castor and Pollux weary of the Floods Left all their Mates, and trac'd the shady Woods: And as they gaz'd, beneath a gloomy Cave They saw a Spring roul on a purling wave, Like Silver pure, and round on every part
Contriv'd by prudent Nature's happy art Small Fountains flow'd, and bubled o're the Grass, As clear as Chrystal, and as smooth as Glass: Tall Firs and Planes, and Cypress shade the Streams, Defending from the Fury of the Beams, The Banks were crown'd with Flowers, which Nature brings For Bees, and to embalm the dying Springs: By this a Man in shineing Armour sate, Frightful his look, and terrible as Fate: His Face was full of Knubs, how large his Chest? His Shoulders broad and equal to his Breast: His Flesh like Brass, more hard the more he fought, Like a Colossus on an Anvil wrought: And as tall Rocks that have long time withstood The numerous whirlings of a rapid Flood, At last grow round, but yet unconquer'd stand, So lookt the swelling Muscles on his hand; And o're his Shoulders hung a Lion's Skin Claspt by the golden Paws beneath his Chin; With some surprize and wonder in his look Brave Pollux view'd him, and at last he spoke: P. Health Sir, what Nations plough this happy shore? A. How health, when I see men ne're seen before? P. Fear not, we're honest, and no danger's near;
A. I do not, nor need you bid me not fear: P. Your Answer's rude, your manners are untame, A. What's that? Sir, as you see me, such I am: But what have you to do to tread these shores, Did e're I come to trouble you on yours? P. Sir if you did you should be entertain'd, Be grac't with gifts, and treated as a friend: A. Talk not of Presents thus, thy gifts I scorn, Nor have I any ready to return: P. May I not tast the Streams that idly flow? A. If Thirst hath scorcht thy Bowels thou shalt know: P. Here's Gold, I'le give you any price to gain: A. Then you must fight a single Man to Man: Set foot to foot, and steddy Eyes advance, And use your greatest skill, nor trust to Chance: P. Whom must I fight with? must I beat the Air? A. Thy match is ready, and thy equal near: P. And what's the prize? what must the Conqueror have? A. The conquer'd, Sir, shall be the Conquerors Slave: P. This is Cock's sport, not fit for generous Men, Where the dull Dastard leaves the Cackling Hen: A. Or Cock's or Lion's, I'me resolv'd on this: I than my self can stake no worthier prize: This said, Amycus, did his Trumpet sound,
The Vallies rung, and eccho'd all around, Thro every distant Field the noise was heard, And Crouds of stout Bebrycians soon appear'd: Whilst from the Ship the thronging Heroes press, To view the Fight and judge of the Success, Now were their Whirlbats bound, rough Thongs em∣brac't Their knotty Arms, and ty'd their Weapons fast: Out they advanc't, and each with Fury shook, They breath'd Defiance, Terror in their look: Here was a noble strife of Art begun Who on his Back should gain the setting Sun, And Pollux gain'd it, the descending Rays Shone full in mighty Amycus's Face: Inrag'd at this his headlong Fury roe, And he rusht on, and doubled all his blows, But Pollux soust his Cheek, it flow'd with gore, He saw his Blood, and then he rag'd the more: The Fight grew hotter, like a mighty Oak He backward bent to take the greater stroke, Shouts the Bebrycians gave, and rais'd his Heat, The Heroes cheer'd stout Pollux with as great; For they all fear'd lest forc't to narrow streights Pollux should fall beneath the threatned weights: But he with dextrous skill and watchful Art
Still shunn'd the strokes, secure on every part, He ply'd him hard, and did his force controul, Tho great his Courage, furious was his Soul: Doz'd with the strokes the nodding Hero stood, And from his Mouth flow'd Streams of clotted Blood▪ The Grecians shouted when they view'd the blows, And saw his broken Cheeks, and batter'd Nose, His Eyes contracted in his swelling Face, And by their shoutings doubled the disgrace: The Prince still eager prest, he ply'd him hard, And with false strokes soon beat him from his guard, And, when he saw him staggering, aim'd a blow, The stroke was sure, and smote his haughty Brow, The Ball return'd as from a hardned Stone, But tore the Flesh, and left the naked Bone: O're come by this and yielding to the wound The Hero fell, and bit the bloody ground; But rose, and then a fiercer Fight began, Inraged by his Disgrace, and by his pain: Both tost their Whirlbats, and vast wounds bestow'd, With Blood and Sweat their labouring Bodies flow'd: Stout Amycus still aim'd at Hands and Breast, And with redoubled force he bravely prest, But wiser Pollux every fatal blow
Aim'd at his Head, and craz'd his nodding Brow: His limbs grew less, his color turn'd to pale, And from a mighty Giant shrunk to small, But Pollux seem'd to grow, he lookt more great, His color better, and increast by Heat; But Muse, how Pollux did the Hero quell What stroke he gave, explain, for you can tell, I sing as you direct, your voice obey, And gladly follow, when you lead the way: Designing now to push the Combat on He seiz'd on Pollux left hand with his own, Bending to shun the stroke, and closeing nigh Reacht out his right, and graspt his Brawny Thigh: But he his body bow'd, and broke the Lock, And at his Temple aim'd a fatal stroke, Just where the vital powers their Seats maintain, And work new Spirits to support the Brain, There fell the Blow; wide gap'd the horrid wound To let in Fate, and the vast Hero groan'd: The blood sprang out, his mouth his left-hand smote And shatter'd Teeth fell down his batter'd throat: His Cheeks were beaten close, his Nose grew flat, And trebled Blows still urg'd his hasty Fate: The Hero fell extended o're the Plain,
Gave o're the Fight, nor could he rise again, His hands stretcht out, as, whilst he breath'd his last, He meant to keep off Fate that came too fast, Here no proud word, and no disdainful Eye On thy lost Foe did stain thy Victory; But he by his great Father Neptune swore, That he would never injure Strangers more: Thus have I Pollux sung, and paid my due, My next, great Castor, must be grac't by you. Castor and Pollux had taken away Phaebe and Talaris the Daughters of Lucippus, who were betroth'd to Lynceus and Idas the Sons of Aphareus: A War en∣sueing Castor kills Lynceus, and Idas is slain by Thunder. NOW had the Valiant Sons of mighty Jove, Grown fierce and too injurious by their Love Lucippus Daughters seiz'd, and forc't away Their beauteous prize, and melancholly prey: Aphareus Sons pursu'd, resolv'd to try Their Force, and gain their promis'd Brides, or dye; Both sides now meet at brave Aphareus Tomb, Which Fate design'd the Lovers Field of doom; All from their Chariots leap, for fight prepare, Well arm'd, and well appointed for the War: When Lynceus thus beneath his Helmet spoke, The Vallies Echo'd, and the Mountains shook: What means this rage, this impious violence,
To ravish first, then fight in its defence? What mean the Shields and Spears, these Iron bands, And naked Weapons in your threatning Hands? Lucippus Daughters are by right our due, Betroth'd to us before e're known to you: His Oaths confirm'd it, and 'twas base by stealth To covet others right, and others wealth; By gifts to bribe him, and his mind pervert, And win by Art, unable by desert: And often I, your base designs to check, Have said, tho I can better fight than speak; Unprincely 'tis to court another's Spouse, And tempt weak Innocence to break her Vows: Sparta and Elis breed a numerous race, All perfect Beauties both in mind and face: There you may Court, and whom you please may have, What Parents will refuse the rich and brave? Permit our Match, let us our right pursue, And we will joyn to find fit Brides for you: These were my words, but these the wanton Winds Bore to the floods, they never reacht your Minds, For both inexorabl bent appeard, You heard, but ne're regarded what you heard: Yet now be just, our promis'd Brides restore, For we are Kin, and then I ask no more: But if you needs must fight, if War desire, If nought but Blood can quench your lustful fire; Let Pollux and let Idas Arms forbear, And never try the hated chance of War; Let▪ Castor, you and I the fight maintain, And see whose Courage shows the bravest Man: For this will give our Friends sufficient proof, And if one fals there will be loss enough;
Let some survive to chear our drooping friends, And wed the Maids, and make them just amends: For this is friendly to restrain our heat, And make the loss but small, when the Contention's great▪ Thus Lynceus spoke, to this both sides agree, And Jove confirm'd it by his ixt decree; Pollux and Idas laid there Armour by, Attending on their Brother's Victory: Lynceus did first within the lists appear Beneath his Shield he shook his threatning Spear, Then Castor came, strong Shields did guard their Breasts, And on their Helmets nodded dreadful Crests; First with their Spears began the noble strife, Each sought to find an open pass to Life; But all invain, the Shields the strokes endur'd, Their Spears were blunted, and the Men secur'd; Their Swords they drew, the Blades like Lightning shone Before the Thunderbolt falls swiftly down; Now rose their Fury, Castor bravely prest, He pierc't his Shield and chopt the waveing Crest; And many thrusts the quick-ey'd Lynceus made The Shield, and Crest once felt his furious Blade: But Castor stepping backward reacht a blow, And strook his Wrist, and tam'd his haughty foe, Disabled thus, and grown unfit for fight He dropt his weapon, and prepar'd for flight To his great Father's Tomb, where Idas sate, A sad Spectator of his Brothe's Fate: But Castor soon pursu'd, close thrusts he made, And thro his Belly forc't his thundering Blade; Out rusht his Bowels thro the gapeing wound, And he fell forward on the shakeing ground, Cold Death came on and did his heart surprize,
And Sleep Eternal sate upon his Eyes. Nor did his Mother valiant Idas lead With pious wishes to his Marriage bed, For to revenge falln Lynceus hasty doom He tore a Pillar from the sacred Tomb, To dart at Castor, dreadfully he stood, The fierce Revenger of his Brother's blood; Jove interpos'd, and by his strickt command Swift Lightning strook the Marble from his hand, He strove to reach it, but his Soul was fir'd, He fell, and in no Common Destiny expir'd: Thus must the Brothers still victorious prove, So Great in Courage, and ally'd to Jove. Hail Leda's Sons, still vigorous strength infuse, And still preserve the Honor of my Muse: You, Helen, and the Valiant Brave that strove At Troy for Injur'd Menelaus Love, Poets have serv'd, for with exalted rage They tell your fame, and spread thro future Age; Homer hath rais'd it with a lofty thought, He writes with the same Spirit that you fought; He sings the Grecian fleet, grave Nestor's care, And brave Achilles, fortress of the War: I bring the Tribute of a meaner Muse, Those humble strains her spareing Heats infuse; Yet this is all, the best that I can do, The utmost that my Talent will allow: And to the Gods, let Riches vainly strive, Songs are the greatest present Men can give. FINIS.
