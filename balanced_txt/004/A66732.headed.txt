This Synopsis of Heraldry is with all possible humility and submisiveness most humbly Dedicated to your Honours by Robert Wiseman blazon or coat of arms HONI SOIT QVI MAL Y PENSE MUTARE VEL TIMERE SPERNO To the Rt and most Honble Henry Somerset Lord erbert Baron of Chepstow Raglan & Ger Earle & Marquess of Worcester Ld President & Ld Leiutenant of Wales & the Marshes Ld Leiutenant of the Counties of Glocester Hereford & Monmorth & of the Citie & County of Bristoll Ld Warden of his Maties Forrest of Dean & Costuble of the Castle of St Bri∣avell in the said forrest one of his Maies mosst Honble Privy Councell & Kt of the most noble order of the Garter &c. depiction of mounted knight Antient blazon or coat of arms PIE REPONE TE To the Right and  Marqvese of  Viscount  most Honoble  &c. depiction of mounted knight Antient To the Nobility and Gentry, My Lords and Gentlemen, I hope it will be pardona∣ble that I here present you only with your noble Coats and Surnames, since my papr will not admit of Roome to sett downe your Titles and dignities, the which are soe generally knowne that it would be impertinance in me to pretend illustration vpon those renowned monuments which will remain to all ages. And also, it being a rule for instruction, I was forced to sett Coats in order according to my purpose (though not altogether according to the antiquities of the Coates) I hope it will suffice if diligently and carfully observed, to Blazon any Coat that is presented to your view which is only the aime of My Lords and Gentlemen your most humble and most respectfull Servant. Ro: Wiseman Le Blazon Or a short and easie way to attain to the art of Heraldry. The Explanation. I have here Endeavoured to put much in a little roome, and to be as short as I could in giveing you a method to blazon any Coate whatsoever. (I hope it wil not seeme hard) all the Colours are hatcht according to the first seaven Escocheons, and taken care to name every Charge at least once as for example. In the Crosses I haue named the first a plaine Crosse, and then haue named no more but the Alterations, as wavy or Ingrayled &c. and soe of a Saltire and bend, and soe of Lions, I haue done the like of all other cha∣rges, but if any other charge accompany a Lion, or other charge then the Lion is not named, but the other things that are found. As S.r John Hoskins Coate (of Herefs) is written over between (Party per pale the Cheveron and the Lions are named in other places) therefore I say between, that is Party per pale azure and Gules, a Cheveron betweene 3 lyons Rampant or. Or thus he beareth argent 3 lozanges in ffesse Gules, within a Bordure sable, by the name of Mountagu, of which there are severall noble Familys. you see the bordure must be named, and if it be invecked ingrayl∣ed waved &c. it must be expressed, if entoyre, you must say of so many bezants, if Enaleurō of so many birds. To Blazon you must begin with the Feild, and say he bear∣eth Or Argent or Gules &c. and then name the Charge and the Charge charged, nameing their true position number and figure, and for a better rule, observe that all com∣mon Charges in the mixt bearings are borne in vpon or with Cheife, Pale, bend, Cheveron, Crosse, Saltier, Canton Fess Giron, Pile, Escocheon, bordure, or orle, or one Commō Charge in vpon or with another Observation. in Heraldry, the rule is never to put Metall upon Metall, nor Colour vpon Colour, other∣wise the Armes are ffalse. Of Termes in Heraldry, Lions, Griffons, Wlues, and Beares. are Rampant if Exactly in pale but if more bend wayes Lyons, Wolves, and Beres are Saliant, Griffons sergreiant, lyons are also gued and Armned Gules, or Azure or, the like. Griffons are arm∣ed, Eagles likewise, Swans membred, Hawkes are Iessed and Belled, Cocks are armed Cressed and Velloped, Capons are armed Cressed, and Iow∣lopped, All these things are to be expressed when they are mett with (that is) when the tongues bills and Claws are found of differing Colour from the body. And when any liveing creature proeed from the bottom of any ordinary, it is  and when oer two Colours, then Ies when it proceeds from the middle of any ordinary or common Charge, it is said, naissant of Furrs, Ermine is white, powdered  black. ermines is black powdered with white. Ermynois is yellow, powdered with black Pean black, pow∣dered with yellow. vayre is of argent, or Azure, but if of other Colours, it is to be expressd vayre of such colours. Fesse, Bend, and Cheveron, have their des as you see in their order. Their proportion, is thus, the Pale occuieth a Fifth part of the escutcheon but if charge  part the bend likewise, the fesse chiefe nd saltier likewise, the pallet is halfe the Pale,  the fourth part, the Barr halfe the fesse &  Baronetts have allways the addition of  sinister hand gules, to their coate, and single Ladys beare their Coates in the forme of a Lozange. Any Gentleman that beares a Coate may im∣ple his wives Coate with it as  as shee liv∣eth, and if shee be an hei  and his heires for ever, and soe it come  y persons of Quality have many  to blazon them you must say he beareth quarterly of 4 6 or 8 Coates, begining at ye first and soon to ye last. Coats are blazoned either by Metalls precious Stones or planetts, the latter are commonly made vse of in blazoning the armes of Princes and pers:ons of Honour.
