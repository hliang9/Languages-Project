WHereas by the Statute made in the eight and twentieth yeer of the reign of King HENRY the eight for prizing of Wines, it is provided, that the Lord Chancellour, Lord Treasurer, Lord President of the Kings most honourable Councell, Lord Privie Seal, and the Lords chief Iustices of either Bench, or five, four, or three of them, shall have power and authority by their discretions, to set the prizes of all kinde of Wines, as in the said Statute is expressed: And whereas the Lord keeper of the great Seal of England, the Lord chief Iustice of the Kings Bench, and the Lord chief Iustice of the Common-Pleas, the nine and twentieth day of December last past, upon conside∣ration of the Prizes that Wines bear this yeer in forraign parts, did order, That Canary Wines, and Allegant should be sold in grosse at eighteen pounds the Pipe, and Musca∣dels in grosse at eighteen pounds the Butt, and at twelve pence the quart by Retail: Sacks and Mallagoes at sixteen pounds the Butt in grosse, and at eleven pence the quart by Retail: the best Gascoin and French Wines at eighteen pounds the Tun, and the Ro∣chel Wines, and other small and thin Wines at fifteen pounds the Tun in grosse, and at six pence the quart by Retail; and according to these proportions for greater or lesser quan∣tities, either in Grosse or by Retail: And that none presume to sell at higher Prizes during the next yeer now ensuing, whereof the Clerk of the Crown is to take notice, and to see the same proclaimed the next Terme in Chancery, according to the Statute.

Now that all excuse may be removed from such as inhabit in remote parts of this Realm, and that such as shall be found Delinquents herein, may acknowledge their own wilfulnesse the cause of the danger, and penaltie they fall into after advertisement, Our Will and Plea∣sure is, and by this Our Proclamation We do publish and declare, That the said Prizes and Rates so ordered and set, shall be observed and kept, according as by the Lawes of this Kingdom they ought to be, for one yeer next following, in all Our Ports, and other places within this Realm, where Wines are landed, and within ten miles of those Ports and pla∣ces. And it is Our Pleasure, that in places where Wines by Land carriage shall be con∣veyed more then ten miles from the next Port, the severall sorts of Wines aforesaid, shall and may be sold according to the Rates aforesaid, allowing four pounds in the Tun, or one peny in the Quart for the carriage thereof upon Land, every thirty miles from the next convenient Port, And according to that proportion, and not at greater Rates: Straitly charging and commanding such of Our Subjects, and others whom it shall concern, that none of them, during the time aforesaid, presume to sell any of the said Wines at higher Rates, then by this Our Proclamation are declared, under the forfeitures and penalties mentioned in the said Statute, and other the Lawes and Statutes of this Realm ordain∣ed in that behalf. Given at Our Court at VVindsor, the two and twentieth day of January, in the seventeenth yeer of Our Reign. ❧ God save the King. ¶ Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most Excellent Majestie: And by the Assignes of JOHN BILL. 1641.
