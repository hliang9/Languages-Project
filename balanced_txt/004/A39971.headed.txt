THE FORFEITURES OF Londons Charter, Or an Impartial Account of the SEVERAL SEISURES OF THE City Charter, Together with the Means and Methods that were used for the Recovery of the same, with the Causes by which it came forfeited, as likewise the Im∣prisonments, Deposing, and Fining the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Sheriffs, since the Reign of King Henry the Third to this present Year, 1682. Being faithfully collected out of Antient and Modern Historys, and now Seasonably Published for the satisfaction of the Inqui∣sitive, upon the late Arrest made upon the said Charter by Writ of Quo Warranto. Printed for the Author, and are to be Sold by Daniel Brown, at the Black-Swan and Bible without Temple-Bar, and Thomas Benskin in St. Brides-Church-Yard, 1682.
Since the Charter was granted to the Antient and Famous City of London by William the Conqueror, Henry the Second, and other Kings of this Realm, we find se∣veral Inspections have been made into it, and that at sundry times the Priviledges and Charter of the said City hath been taken away and suspended; The Histo∣rical Relation of which, as it is Recorded by the most Authentick of our English Writers. Being now thought seasonable and useful, is intended to be the Subject of this Treatise. TO begin at the 50 year of the Reign of Henry the Third, Anno Dom. 1265. Upon the Citizens taking part with the Earl of Leicester and the Barons, against the King, after the said Earl was Slain at the Battle of Eversham, and the King again was restored to his Royal Dignities, he began to call to mind how the Citizens had shut their Gates against him and succour'd his Enemies, so that calling a Parliament at West∣minster about the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin, in the year aforesaid, all the Statutes that had been made by the Parliament the Barons had Assembled at Oxford were Repealed, and also all such as had favoured the Barons, and were as then either in Pri∣son or abroad should be disinherited: It was also ordain'd, and passed the Assent of both Houses, that many of the Wealthiest Citizens of London should be cast into Prison, and the City should be deprived of the Liberties and Priviledges that had been formerly granted and confirmed to them; as likewise that all the Chains and Posts should be pulled up and taken away, there∣by to leave the Streets fenceless, &c. This was no sooner En∣acted
but put in Execution, for the chief Citizens were Arrested and committed to Ward within the Castle of Windsor, till they should pay such Fines as were demanded, which was 300 pounds a peice at least, whereupon the Liberties of the City, pursuant to the said Act, were suspended, and the Tower of London forti∣fied with Outworks for its better Security, as likewise such Posts and Chains as had been brought out of the City, were placed a∣bout the Defences in nature of Barracado's; not long after ano∣ther Parliament was called at Westminster, wherein a great num∣ber of such as had been aiding to the Barons, had their Lands confiscated, which Lands the King no sooner seized, but he gave them to such as had faithfully served him in the Wars, so that a considerable number, as well of Citizens as others, were ob∣leiged to Compound with such as had the Donation bestowed upon them. Upon these and such like proceedings of the King, the Lon∣doners thought it their safest way to submit to the Kings Mercy, and after long attendance, and at the incessant Intreaties of such Noble Persons at Court as they could make their Friends, they obtained a Pardon, though many of the Commoners refused to joyne with the Mayor and Aldermen, and other Wealthy Citi∣zens therein, being rather inclined to stand it out, and held se∣veral Debates about defending the City against the King, but their Resolutions in that affair were by most of the wisest sort held as pernicious and dangerous to the Peace and Tranquility of the Nation: The reason that induced them to such obstinacy as most conjecture, was because the City at that time was Inha∣bited by sundry Nations, who, during the Intestine Broils, had been admitted as Citizens to defend the same, but in the end, all those Debates and Consultations came to no effect, for when every Man had spent his Verdict, it was thought the safest way to submit to the Kings Pleasure, and consent to what he should think fit, upon which Submission, and a Fine of 20000 Marks, the King received them again into his Favour, and ordered, that such Lands, Houses, and other things as had been Con∣fiscated,
and not disposed of, should be restored again to the Owners. After which, he did not deliver them the possession or keep∣ing of the City as formerly, but placed Sir—Othon as Custos or Guardian of the same, who was also Constable of the Tower: he likewise chose to be Bayliffs, or as they are now called Sheriffs, John Adrian and Walter Henery Citizens: The King proceeded yet farther, and compelled the most substantial a∣mongst them to give their Sons as Pledges or Hostages, thereby to prevent any Revolt for the future, which Pledges or Hosta∣ges he caused to be kept in the Tower of London, and maintained at the Cost of their Parents; as likewise by advice of his Coun∣sel, he constituted a Captain in every County, (now called by the name of Lord Lieutenant) to suppress any Rebellion that might arise upon the distast of the unruly multitude. The King having all this while continued in the City, the better to have an Eye upon, and keep in awe such as upon the aforementioned occasions were ever now and then ready to make Insurrections, and upon his departure ordained Sir John Lind and John Waldren Governours in his Absence, by the Names of Seneschals or Stewards, but such earnest Suits were made by the Londoners to obtain a free Pardon, that in the end, after the said Guardians or Governours had taken sufficient Security for the payment of the Fine of 20000 Marks, the King granted them his Charter of Pardon under the Great Seal and sent it them, wherein he freely remitted and pardoned all Trespasses and of∣fences that had been committed by them during the War, only the Lands, Houses, Goods and Persons which he had given to Prince Edward his Eldest Son, were excepted. This Charter of Pardon and Restauration of the Cities Li∣berties, Priviledges, and Immunities, was dated at Northampton in the 50 Year of his Reign, Anno Dom. 1266. upon which the Senescal was discharged, and the Citizens chose then for Mayor William Fitz Richards, and for Sheriffs Thomas de la Fourd and Gregory de Rocksledge, and had the mannagement of
the City intire as ever, so that Trade began to flourish, and the Companies began to Incorporate, but this happiness lasted not long, for in the 52 year of the said King Henry the Third, Anno Dom. 1267. The King being absent in the Country, the Earl of Gloucester taking great displeasure for that he might not have his Will, as well for Banishing of Strangers, as for Restitution to be made unto such as had been disherited, he began to raise new Tumults, for having raised a great power in the Marches of Wales, he came directly for London, pretending at first as if he came to aid the King in his intended War with France, upon which plausible pretence, he obtained leave of the Mayor and Citizens to pass through the City into Southwark, where he En∣camped, and shortly after Sir John de Evilli came and joyned him with about 2000 Horse and Foot, upon which, and some other Actions that had happened, the Mayor caused the Bridge and Water-side to be guarded Day and Night with such Forces as could be raised, and the Draw-bridge to be drawn up every Night, but within a while, the Earl used the Matter so, that he was permitted to Lodge within the City with a considerable number of his men, and getting into favour with such as bore most sway, he by degrees got all his Army to Quarter there, and having thus taken possession, he got the Keys of all the Gates, and set a Guard of his own men to Watch them, upon which the Popes Legate, who had fled to the Tower for safety came out, and exhorted the Earl to desist his Rebellious Practi∣ses, but in vain, for the Earl not only commanded him to return from whence he came, but likewise gave strict charge to such as kept the Guard on that side, that no Provision should be per∣mitted to be carried into the Tower, notwithstand about 2000 persons were got into it, resolving to defend it. for the King till such time as he Arived with such Forces as he had gathered in Cambridge-shire and other places adjacent. Upon the great abuses that were at that time used towards Strangers, a considerable number of Jews, with their Wives and Children, got likewise into the Tower, and had one quarter of
at assigned them, to defend which, they did very Manfully, so that many of the Londoners fearing new Insurrections might be occasioned by such proceedings, went out of the City, and car∣ried with them the greatest part of their Substance, and what they left behind them was seized by the Earls command, who suffered his Men to spoil it at pleasure. The greater part of the Commons of the City took part with the Earl, which highly offended the King, and the more, for that they (being as it were without Government) tumultuously Assembled at Guild-hall, and there chose for their Mayor Sir Richard de Colworth, and for Bayliffs Robert de Linton and Roger Marshal, discharging the Sheriffs of their Places, Offices, and Trusts, contrary to the desires and endeavours of the more Mo∣derate and Judicious part of the Citizens, and carrying on their outrages yet farther, they forc'd divers Aldermen and chief Citi∣zens to Prison without Law or Process, and having them in safe Custody went to their Houses, where they not onely defaced them, but took their Goods and spoyled them, under a pretence of Sequestration; as likewise all that had been Imprisoned within the City Prisons upon the Quarrel of the Barrons, they set at Liberty. Whilst these tumultuous Actions were at London, the King lay at Cambridge with a considerable Army to hinder the Rovers that had fortified the Isle of Ely) from making Incursions on that side, notwithstanding they committed many outrages, be∣ing emboldened so to do, by reason of the London Tumults, as well knowing they would oblige the King to draw off his For∣ces; and such of them as were not intercepted by the Kings Forces, frequently came to joyne with the Earl, doing great Mischiefs by the way; by whose assistance the Earl being much encouraged, undertook to assail the Tower which held for the King, in which was the Popes Legate, and a great number of Armed men, as is before recited, upon the first News of which attempt, the King dislodged his Army and Marched towards London, but finding his Power too weak, he was obliged to sell
his Plate and Jewels to raise more Forces, whereupon he sent Prince Edward and others into France and Scotland to raise them, and again retired to Cambridge, where he continued till the Prince came to him with an Army of 30000 Scots and French. The King upon this Recruit, leaving a sufficient power at Cambridge to defend those parts from the Rovers, advanced with all diligence towards London, resolving to give the Earl Battle, (if he durst leave the City to meet him) sending a Herauld to give him notice of his intent. When he was come to Windsor, he there Encamped, the bet∣ter to inform himself how affairs stood in the City, and how the people stood inclined, not wanting many Loyal persons there to give him secret Intelligence what happened from time to time; he had not long stayed at Windsor, but his Army daily encreased, which made Gloucester and his Party begin to doubt of the pro∣mised Success with which they had flattered themselves, and thereupon were very desirous of Peace, but the King would not hearken to their Proposals, whereupon they appointed to give him Battle upon Houndslow-heath, but the King coming thither with his whole Army at the day appointed, found that they had altered their resolutions, no person being there to oppose him; after he had stayed some time, and understood by his Scouts that no Army approached, he set forwards towards London, and wheeling about, brought his whole Army to Stratford, where he gave command they should Encamp. In the mean while a Party of the Rebels that Quartered in Southwark went to Westminster, where they dēstroyed the Church and much defaced the Abby; then coming to the Kings Pallace and finding it disserted, they broke open the Gates and plunder∣ed it, breaking all the Windows, and defacing the Images or Statues, scarce forbearing to set it on Fire; they likewise Rob∣bed several other great Houses about London. As the King lay thus Encamped at Stratford, there came to him from beyond the Sea the Earls of Bullogne, and St. Paul with
2000 Men at Armes; also there Arived in the Thames a Fleet of great Ships with a considerable Supply of Gascoines, which lay before the Tower waiting the Kings command, to oppose whose Landing Gloucester drew Trenches and raised Bullworks, but when no Man hoped for Peace, by the mediation of the King of Almaigne, the Lord Philip Basset and others, the King consen∣ted to a Treaty, wherein the Ordinance of Killingworth was in all points observed, and in that Treaty of Peace the Londoners were comprehended and taken into favour upon condition that they forthwith payed 1000 Marks to the King of Almaigne for the Burning his House at Thisleworth, and the Officers that had been displaced during the Tumults, to be restored to their re∣spective Trust, and such as had been wrongfully Imprisoned, to take their course at Common-Law against so many of the offen∣dors as they could Learn were concerned therein. In the 51 year of the Reign of Edward the third, Anno Dom. 1377 the Duke of Lancaster using the Kings Authority, directed Warrants to all the Lords and Barrons, Knights and Burgesses that 15 days after St. Hillary they should be present at London, there to Assemble in Parliament, to adjust matters appertaining to the Publick Weel of the Kingdom, to this Parliament came Richard of Burdaux (Son to Edward the black Prince, and Grand-Child to the King) accompanyed with a great number of Knights and Gentlemen, and was received by the Londoners after the best manner, being presented with many Rich Gifts, as likewise his Uncle the Duke of Lancaster seemed to Honour him above the rest, placeing him in the Chair of State and ad∣vised him to demand that they would give the King two Tenths in one year, or else of all the Merchandice that were sold in England for one year 12 pence of every pound, of every Fire-House one Penny, and of every Knights Fee one Pound of Silver, which demands the Duke earnestly Prosecuted, saying they of necessity must grant one of these Points, for that the Enemies had Proclaimed War, and would suddainly Invade the Realm, upon which the Parliament desired time to debate the matter,
when as the day appointed for delivering their Opinions was come, one Mr. Hungerford was elected to deliver their Opinions who had been (if at that time he was not) the Dukes Steward, though some were of Opinion that Sir Peter de la Moor was the fittest Man on that occasion, but these latter being few in num∣ber they prevailed nothing. Whilst these things were doing the Duke proceeded, yet farther and demanded a Subsidy of the whole Clergy, which so thoroughly netled the Bishops, that they mightily opposed it, but the Duke consulting with one Wicliffe, who greaaly Inveigh∣ed against the Clergy, he affirmed that it was lawful not only for the King but for Temporal Lords, to take the Goods of Cler∣gy-men towards their Subsistance if necessity required it, the better to effect this by pleasing the Bishops, he Treated with the Arch-Bishop of Canterbury, to call a Convocation, which was accordingly done, and William Wickam Bishop of Win∣chester who had been Banished several Miles from Court, was by the Dukes order brought there to this Convocation, it was ordained that the aforesaid Wicliffe should appear to answer for his spreading his Doctrine throughout the City, and in other places, as likewise giving his Opinion to the Duke in prejudice to the Clergy, and that being Tryed and Convicted for the same, he should undergo such Penaltys as that Assembly should think fit. And on the 15 of February in the year aforesaid the Convo∣cation being Assembled, he was brought forth by the Dukes com∣mand, and as he came he was greatly annimated, by such of his followers as had embraced his Doctrine and Councelled nei∣ther to fear the Bishops nor the great concourse of People, seeing not only the Duke, but likewise all the Nobillity present, were his Friends, when he came into our Ladys Chapple in St. Pauls Church, Henry Peircy chief Marshal of England, willed him to sit down and in a manner compelled him so to do, saying, that he had much to answer, and therefore ought to sit, upon which the Bishops were highly offended, the Bishop of London in the
name of all the rest, alledging that since he was come as a Cri∣minal to answer before his ordinary to such things as should be objected against him, he ought to shew more Respect and Rever∣ence to the Convocation. The Duke being present, and hearing the words of the Bishop began sharply to reprehend him, Swearing that he would pull down not only his Pride, but that of all the Bishops in England, and added, that although he Trusted in his Parents, they could profit him nothing, to which the Bishop replyed, that he neither Trusted in his Parents, nor in the Life of any Man, but in God only, in whom he ought to trust. This last answer so Inraged the Duke, that he Whispring the Bishop softly, told him, he would rather draw him out of the Church by the Hair of the Head then suffer such things at his Hands. The Londoners who were all this while waiting in Crouds without, hearing how the Duke had threatned their Bishop, gave a Loud Shout, Swearing, that they would rather loose their Lives then any violence should be offered to their Bishop in his own Church, and that which heightened their Fury the more was, that the Duke being President in Parliament, where the day before it was requested in the Kings name that from that day forwards there should be no more Mayor of London, but that a Captain should be appointed, and that the Marshal of England as well in the City as in other places, might Arrest such as offen∣ded, with many other things which were mannifestly against the Libertys of the City. The Morrow after the Londoners Assembled themselves to take Councel what they should do in such a strait they were like to fall into, in case a Captain should be chosen, they concluing their Liberties must be no longer continued, especially if the Marshals Office extended it self within their Jurisdiction, and farther, they argued what might be done in Reperation of the affront or Injury put upon their Bishop, and whilst they were debating these matters and differing in Opinions about coming to a conclusion what to do, the Lord Fitz Walter, and Sir Guidio
Brian entered the City, whether to know their minds or other∣wise is uncertain, but the unruly Multitude construing things in the worst Sense, were hardly restrained from falling upon them, nor had they escaped the Hands of the Multitude had not they Sworn they came not in the least to perjudice the City, when having no soonor obtained belief and pacified the Rabble, but the Lord Fitz Walter stood up and made an Oration, the effects of which was, that whereas he being by Antient Inheritance, Stand∣ard Bearer to the City, was to take Injuries offered to them as to him∣self, and thereupon willed them to look to their Defence. He had no sooner ended but they run to their Arms, every one taking what came next to hand, and in a great rage went to the Inn where the Marshal lay, breaking open the Doors and searching all parts of the House where they imagined he might be, but not finding him, they brought out a Prisoner whom they found there in Fetters and set him at Liberty, and then went to other places in Quest of the Marshal, but found him not, for that day he and the Duke Dined with one John of Ipre, of which they were Ignorant, but they supposed at least to have found them at the Savoy, and thereupon many of them came with all expedition thither, in the mean while one of the Dukes Ser∣vants advertized his Lord what had happened, and advised him to Shift for his safety, whereupon in a great Fright he left his Provision and Fled by Water to his Mannor at Kennington, where finding the Princess and the Young Prince, viz. Richard of Burdeaux, Son to Edward the Black Prince, he related what had happened and grievously complained against the Insolency of the Londoners, the Princess having heard what stirs were abroad, comforted him, and told him that, she would do her endeavour to compose the difference. By this time the Londoners understanding that the Duke and his accomplice Sir Henry Piercy were Fled in great Fury, hasted to the Savoy, where meeting a Priest, who demanded what the matter was, they told him, that they went to sease the Persons of the Duke and Sir Henry Piercy, that thereby they might compel
them to deliver up Sir Peter de la Moor, which they unjustly detained in Prison, upon the hearing of which, the Priest re∣plyed, that Sir Peter de-la Moor was a Traytor to the King and de∣served to be Hang'd; upon which words (so unseasonably Spoken) the Multitude cryed out, That it was Piercy in Disguise, that Tray∣tor to England, and that his Speech betray'd him, though he had changed his Habit, and thereupon they so belaboured him with Swords, Clubs, and other mischievous Instruments, that he fell down upon the place as Dead, but they finding him yet to breath, they halled him to Prison where he Dyed. The Bishop of London hearing of these Stirs as he sate at Dinner, left his Company, and hasted towards the Multitude, where being Arrived, he admonished them by many perswasive Arguments to cease from such Rebellious proceedings and to depart to their respective homes, affirming, that he wonld bring all things that had been done to their prejudice to an amica∣ble composure, upon these perswasions of the Bishop, every one returned to their Habitations, so that all the Multitude were dispersed in less then three hours, yet their hatred against the Duke could not be so thoroughly oblitered, but that the same day they hung up his Arms reverse in the prin∣cipal Streets of the City, in token of his being a Traytor to the Kingdom, (as they then Related) thereby to cast an odium upon his Name, the which when the Duke heard, he requested the Bishop to Pronounce Sentence of Excommunica∣tion against the doers thereof, the Bishop of Bangor therefore being assisted by the Aldermen and other of the prime Citi∣zens, did pronounce the aforesaid Sentence, the Bishop of Lon∣don being unwilling to Incurr the Peoples hate thereby, decli∣ning it. Within three or four days after the Duke went to the Parli∣ament House, where he and several of the Lords that were his Friends being Seated, they demanded of the Knights and Bur∣gesses to return an answer to what had been formerly propo∣sed as to the Subsidie; and had return made by the Knights Bur∣gesses,
&c. that they would not help their Soveraign Lord the King with one penny a head only, but with a groat for every Head throughout the Kingdom above 14 years of Age, if so be that Mony might be deposited in the Hands of certain Lords and Barrons, till such time occasion required the disposure of the same, in the mannagement of the Kings affairs, and that every Religious Person promoted should pay one Shilling. The Duke having thus obtained his desire, in this point began to call to mind the affront offered to him by the Londoners, wherefore he caused the King to send for the Mayor, Sheriffs, and Aldermen of the City, who being Introduced into the Kings presence (he being at his mannor of Sheene now Richmond) they found him placed in a Chair, not well able to Speak, by reason of his Sickness, the Duke, the Arch-Bishop, and other Bishops, with many Lords and Honourable Personages sitting about him, where after due Reverence made, and Silence commanded, Sir Robert Aston began an Oration, perswading the Citizens to confess their great and Heinous offences against the King and Duke, and to submit themselves to their Mercy; whereunto the Londoners an∣swered, that they had not conspired against the Duke; neither had there heen any Evildone or spoken against him, which they did consent to or know off, which they were ready to prove before their So∣veraign Lord the King and Duke himself; yet they confessed that they could not stay the Insolency of the unruly Multitude, by whom that which had chanced was committed, wherefore they requested the King that he would not by any means Punnish those that were Innocent and Ignorant of the Fact, instead of those that committed it, promising that they would do their ut∣most endeavour to apprehend such as were guilty, and compell them by Law to make satisfaction, saying, that they were no able to do in that point for the Duke as they would, whereupon they were dismissed, not a little glad that they came off so well.
A while after the King sent privately to them, and com∣manded, That they should Assemble together, and make a Wax Candle or Taper, with the Dukes Arms on it, and carry it in a General Procession, to St. Pauls Church, there continually to burn before the Image of the Virgin Mary, at the Charges of the City. This was exactly performed; but when the Duke came to hear of it, it rather Exasper∣ated him, then any ways gave him Satisfaction; wherefore he threatned the Citizens more than formerly, saying; that it rather redounded to his disgrace than Honour; for that during his Life, and in a time of Health, they had offered up his Arms: But they excused themselves, by alledging, it was done at the Commandment of the King his Father, and that they would have done any thing that might have pleased him. But this would not avail them, for the Duke ceased not till he had displaced Adam Staple, Mayor of the City, and obtained Nicholas Brember to be Elected in his room; and on the 29th of March 1377. caused him to take his Oath at the Tower of London; as likewise several Alder∣men were Outed, and others placed in their steads. And thus have I given the Reader an Impartial Relation of what happened to the Citizens and City of London, du∣ring the Reign of King Edward the Third, who Dyed at Richmond Anno. 1377. In the 65 Year of his Age, having Reigned 50 Years, 4 Months, and 6 Days. And now I shall proceed to relate what happened to the City during the Reign of Richard the Second, Son to the Black Prince, and Grand-Son to the beforementioned King. But before I Treat of the Discord that happened, I do not think it amiss (though indeed it may be counted by some a Digression) to inform the Reader, how at the beginning of this Kings Reign the Citizens were Reconciled to their Ca∣pital Enemy, the Duke of Lancaster. King Edward was no sooner departed this Life, but the City sent several of the Chief Citizens to wait upon Richard
at Kinington, where he and the Princess his Mother remain∣ed, to promise him their ready Obedience, in Proclaiming him King, as his Right by Confirmation of Parliament, and the Established Laws of the Kingdom; and to assure him of their Loyalty and constant Fidelity, Humbly beseech∣ing him, That he would take upon him to end the discord between them and his Uncle the Duke of Lancaster; to ac∣complish which, he promised to use his utmost endeavour, and with many thanks, suffered the Citizens to depart to their respective Habitations. The morrow after, there were sent into London from the King, the Lord Latimer, Sir Nicholas Bond, Sir Simon Bur∣ly, and Sir Richard Adderbury, to give them a farther Con∣firmation of the Kings affection towards them; and how that he had spoken to the Duke of Lancaster in their behalfs, and that he had submitted himself in all things to the King, touching their Cause; and that it was the Kings pleasure they should do the like; and then he would do his endea∣vour that an Honourable Agreement might be made on the behalf of the City. When the Citizens heard this Message, they were not well pleased, by reason they knew that the King being young, must do what was done by Substitutes; and that the Duke being powerful at Court, would not miss of find∣ing favour; yet notwithstanding, they promised to submit themselves; if so be the afore-mentioned Knights would un∣dertake upon their Oath of Fidelity and Knighthood, that they should not suffer either in Body or Goods; which they consenting to, the Chief Citizens went with them to Sheene where the young King was, with his Mother, the Duke of Lancaster, and a great number of Nobility; when the King knew they were come, he caused them to be brought before him, and in the full Assembly so handled the matter, that the Duke and they entred into an intire Amity, and perpetual Friendship; and after that
the Duke behaved himself so Courteously towards the Common people, that all their former hatred was turned into Love and Good-will towards him: And so much of the Citizens Reconciliation with the Duke of Lancaster, and now to my purpose. In the 15th Year of the Reign of King Richard the Se∣cond, Anno. 1392. the Parliament then Sitting, and not having concluded upon any speedy way of raising money; the King, to supply his present Occasions, sent to the City to borrow the Summ of a 1000 pounds, the which they not only uncourteously refused to lend him, but likewise beat and grievously wounded a Lumbard who offered to supply him with the like Summ; of which the King being adver∣tized, was greately displeased with the Citizens; where∣upon calling together most of the Peers and Noble men of his Kingdom, he complained to them of the froward deal∣ings of the Londoners, and desired them to take notice of the Affront they had put upon him. When the King had told them his mind, the Lords, after a short Conference a∣bout the matter, gave Counsel, That it was not only Ex∣pedient, but very requisite, that the Insolent Pride of those presumptious Persons should be speedily Repressed. The Citizens of London (as it appeareth in those days) using their Authority to the utmost, had devised and set forth divers Orders and Constitutions, to abridge the Li∣berties of Forreigners that came to the City to utter their Wares; which likewise caused great Complaints against them: They in many particulars, as some Writers affirm, having stretched beyond their Bounds, all which served but as Fuel to increase the Kings displeasure against them. And now because I will omit nothing that may occasion any Objection; It is not amiss to give the Reader another Relation, though different from the former, how the City fell into the Kings displeasure, though it was Written by an unknown Author, and therefore of what Credit, I must
leave to the judgement of the Reader, many having re∣jected it as Fabulous, and affirm, that what is before men∣tioned was the real occasion, that which was pretended be∣ing as followeth, viz. That one of the Bishop of Salisbury's Servants meeting a Bakers Boy in Fleet-street, took out of his Basket a Loaf, and utterly refused to restore it again; for which, when the Boy became Clamorous, he broke his head, and gave him many blows upon his body, which the Inha∣bitants perceiving, they came together and would have taken the Bishops man, in order to have conveyed him to Prison, but that his Fellow-Servants hearing in what dan∣ger he was, came to his Rescue, and carried him by force into the Bishops house, which was at that time in Fleet-street: whereupon the multitude increasing, they threatned to pull down the house unless the Offender was delivered up, and had effected it, had not the Mayor and Sheriffs with consi∣derable number of Halberts, come in time to appease them and oblige them to depart every man to his own House. And that of this the Bishop being advertized, made his Complaint to the King; and for that cause, says this un∣known Author, was it that the Citizens fell into the Kings displeasure: but by this his conclusion it proved fictitious; for he tells us, that the Cities Charter upon that cause be∣ing taken away, it was restored by the Intercession of Richard Gravesend, and Bishop of London. In acknowledge∣ment of which, the Citizens for a long time after repaired once a year to his Grave in the Middle Isle of St. Pauls Church, &c. But that is utterly false, for at that time Robert Braybrook was Bishop of London, the aforesaid Gravesend having been Bishop in the Reign of Edward the First, Anno. 1303. almost 90 years before this time, after whom succeeded him in the Bishoprick, Ralph Baldock, Gilbert Seagrave, Richard Newport, Stephen Gravesend, Ri∣chard Went worth, Ralph Stratford, Michael Norbrook, Si∣mon Sudbury, William Courtney, and Robert Braybrook, who sate Bishop 1381, until the year 1403.
Moreover, The place of Burial in St. Pauls, whereunto the Mayor and Citizens of London were wont to repair, was of William, who sat Bishop of London in the time of Wil∣liam the Conqueror, and of him purchased the Charter of the said City. Having thus, as I think, cleared all Objections that might have been started as to the beginning of the Feud, I shall proceed to relate what happened e're the Ci∣tizens could appease the Kings Anger. After the Lords had given their opinions as is before re∣cited, the King commanded that the Mayor, Sheriffs, and several of the most wealthy Citizens, should be Arrested and brought to Nottingham, where on the 11th of June, in the year aforesaid, John Hind the Mayor was Deposed and sent to Windsor-Castle, as likewise the Sheriffs; one of them being sent to Wallingford-Castle, and the other to O∣dam-Castle, and the other Citizens to several adjacent Pri∣sons, there to continue till such time as the King with his Councel should determine, what should be done in that Affair. The Council had not long consulted about it, before they Unanimously consented, and determined that from thenceforth the Londoners should not chuse nor have any Mayor, but that the King should appoint one of his Knights to Govern the City immediately under him; and that their Priviledges should be Revoked, their Liberties Disanull'd, and their Laws Abrogated, all which was accordingly done, the King immediately appointing for Warden or Govern∣our, Sir Edward Darlingrug, Impowering him not only to Rule the City, but to see the Administration of Justice done in all Cases, being stiled Lord Warden of the City, and so continued for the space of Ten days: When the King en∣tering the City, it being the 1 of July, in the 16th year of his Reign, he discharged him of the said Office, and placed in his stead one Sir Baldwin Radington, a right Circumspect and Discreet Gentleman, who knew how not only to please
the Kings mind, but also to retain the good Will of the Citi∣zens, by putting them in hopes of the Kings Favour, and in time to regain what, by their unadvized rashness, they had lost, as in the end it happened. For at the Incessant Intreaties and unwearied Endeavours of several Noble Persons, and especially the Duke of Glo∣cester, the King began to relent and hearken to the offered Submission of the Citizens, fully determining with himself to abate of the Rigor lately imposed, especially when he call∣ed to mind the Honour and Service they had formerly done him, upon several accounts, and the great Gifts they had be∣stowed upon him; whereupon he sent for divers of the Chief Citizens to come to him, he then keeping his Court at Wind∣sor, to shew by what Charters and Grants they held their Liberty, Priviledges, and peculiar Laws, as well the new as the old, that so he might determine by the Advice of his Council, which should be restored, and which abrogated. Hereupon when the said Liberties and Priviledges were laid forth to the view of such Persons as were appointed by the King to take them into consideration; after a due Examina∣tion some were Ratified and Tollerated, and others utterly Abrogated and taken away. Neither could they for the present recover the Person or Dignity of their Mayor, nor obtain the Kings intire favour, till they had satisfied the Damages and Injury by them done, either to the King or his People; and whereas the King had been at great Charges in preparing Forces to Chastize them, as he had absolutely determined, had they not submitted themselves to his mercy, such Charges as he had been at were expected to be payed by the City; the Citizens therefore went, and in a most Humble manner tendered again their Submission, offering, as a Recompence and Satisfaction of their Trespasses, 10000 pounds (a great Summ in those days) but they were at that time sent home, and a certain day ap∣pointed for their appearance, not being given in the least
to understand what they must pay, till the King had advised with his Council about the matter; at length, at the in∣stance of the Nobility, the King was content to pardon all Offences past, but first the Citizens were told that the King intended to come from his Mannor of Sheene to London, and then undoubtedly upon knowledge had of their good meaning and Loyal Intentions for the future, they should obtain his favour. The Citizens having received this welcome news, did not only prepare themselves to meet him, and present him with Gifts of great value, but also to adorn, deck, and trim their City with sumptuous Pageants, rich Hangings, and gorgeous Furniture in all points, as they were wont at a Coronation. At the day appointed 3 or 400 of the chief Citizens on Horse-back all in their Liverys, presented themselves be∣fore him upon the Heath on this side Sheene, and in humble wise craved pardon (in the name of all the Citizens) for their past Offences, and besought him to take his way to his Pal∣lace of Westminster, through the City of London; which request the King granted, and so held on his Journey till he came to London-bridge, where he was presented with a fair White Steed, Saddled, Bridled, and traped in Cloth of Gold, parted with Red and White: As likewise to the Queen was given, a White Palfrey, Saddled, Bridled, and traped as the former; both which were thankfully accept∣ed, and so both the King and Queen passing forwards, en∣tred the City, prepared for their Reception, as is before re∣cited; and over and above, all the substantial Citizens standing on both sides the Streets, and as the King approach∣ed, with audible voice cry'd; King Richard, King Richard. At the Standard in Cheapside, was a right sumptuous Stage ordained, on which was placed divers Representations, and amongst the rest, one Dressed like an Angel, who hold∣ing a Crown of Gold in his hand, richly set-with Stones, put it upon the Kings head as he passed by; as likewise an∣other
on the Queens; this done, the King Rode to St. Pauls Church, and there making his Offering, took Horse again, and Rode to his Pallace at Westminster, where the Mayor and Aldermen take their leave of him, and re∣turned to London. On the Morrow the Mayor and his Brethren went again to Westminster, and there being admitted to the Kings pre∣sence, presented him with two Guilt Basons, and in them 2000 Nobles in Gold, beseeching him to be a good and gra∣cious Lord to the poor distressed City. These Presents he received in Courteous manner, and gave them words of Comfort, promising to endeavour the forgetting their Of∣fences; so that three days after they received a new Con∣firmation of all their old Liberties, (at least such as were most advantageous to the City, and no Detriment to For∣reigners) wherefore the Citizens being not a little pleased, after some Consideration had, they made a Tablet for an Altar, all of Silver, Guilt with Gold, in which was curiously Ingraven the Story of St. Edward the Confessor, it being esteemed to be worth 1000 Marks; This they presented to the King, which he shortly after offered to the Shrine of St. Edward. The Londoners believed, that by these Gifts they had so far Ingratiated themselves into the Kings favour, as to be out of all danger, and that no farther trouble could accrue; notwithstanding which, they were compelled to give the King after all this, the Summ of 10000 pounds, which was raised by a general Collection amongst the Com∣mons, who payed it with great Regret and Grudging. Hitherto Reader, I have given you an account what has happened to the City of London, and what means have been used by the Mayor, Aldermen, and other Citizens, to ap∣pease the Anger of such Princes, into whose displeasure they had fallen; yet to give a greater Confirmation to the truth of what happened in the Reign of King Richard the Second, I shall give another Relation of the several Transactions, as
it was taken out of the Canon of Licester Abby, by Hen∣ry Knighton: In the year (says he) 1392. the King called a great Council at Stamford, on the morrow after Trinity Sun∣day, about certain Affairs concerning the French-men, in which Council he assembled together his chief Officers, and invited all the old Souldiers that served in former Wars, to repair to him, that so he might be the better enabled to put in practice what should be advised and concluded on; the King also held a great Council at Nottingham, at the Feast of St. John Baptist, where he caused the Mayor of London with the four and twenty Aldermen, the two Sheriffs, and, four and twenty Commoners of the most principal and weal∣thy amongst them, to be brought before him, where he Charged them, That they had forfeited a Bond of 9000 pounds to him, besides their Liberties and Priviledges; which Bond or Obligation they had formerly made to the King, as a Confirmation of their Obedience; and after the King had declared what new offences they had Com∣mitted, he discharged the Mayor, two Sheriffs, and the rest of the Officers of their respective Offices, and sent the Mayor and the two Sheriffs to a certain place, there to be kept in Custody as his Prisoners, divesting the City of Lon∣don of all her Honours and Priviledges, insomuch that a Citizen or Free-man should have no more Prerogative than a Forreigner or Stranger; He also appointed the Lord Ba∣leridge to be Governour thereof, to keep and see kept, the Kings Laws, and his Leige-people within the City of Lon∣don, in due order, until such time as the King had otherwise provided for them; after which, a day was set them to ans∣wer the King and his Council to certain Interrogatorys, which was on the Feast of St. Mary Magdalen, and the place affixed for that purpose, was VVindsor. In the mean while, through the Mediation of such as were well-willers to the City, the Kings Indignation was somewhat mittigated and pacified towards them, insomuch
that at length he released the Mayor and Sheriffs from their Confinements, sending them home to their respective houses, setting over the City (notwithstanding) a new Keeper, or Governour, reserving all the Priviledges and Liberties in his own hands: In the mean time, the Citizens consulting what was best to be done, they at last agreed to submit themselves and all their Goods, to the Kings mercy; when upon the Assumption of the blessed Virgin, all the Wealthy Citizens came to the King, and submitted themselves accor∣dingly; insomuch that he speak friendly to them, and began to receive them into favour: On the VVednesday ensuing, the King was purposed to come to London, and the Citizens in great numbers came out to meet him on Horse-back, and such as could not procure Horses, went on foot to wel∣come him, which they performed with Shouts and joyful Acclamations; and not only men, but likewise women and Children, came flocking about him: When he came near the City, the Bishop of London, with all the Clergy and Religious Persons of all Degrees whatsoever, went out to meet him, so that in that Procession, there were said to be above 500 Boys in Surplices; moreover, the Citizens trim∣ed the out-side of their houses and Chambers in every street, through which the King and Queen were to pass; as for the Houses of the wealthier sort, they were bravely garnished with Cloth of Gold, Silver, Velvet, and other Rich and sumptuous Stuffs: In Cheapside there was a Conduit, out of which two Spouts ran with red and white Wines, and upon the Conduit stood a little Boy, Appareled like an Angel, ha∣ving a Golden Cup in his hand, in which he presented Wine to the King and Queen as they passed by; In the mean time, several Citizens presented the King with a Crown of Gold, of great value, as likewise another to the Queen; and a while after they presented her with a Tablet of Gold with the Story of St. Ann Ingraven in it, the which she most greatfully accepted, and the rather, by reason her own name
was Ann; (as saith our Historian) As likewise to the King, a Golden Tablet of the blessed Trinity, to the value of 800 pounds; such, so great and wondeful Honours, did the Citizens of London to the King and Queen, as the like be∣fore had been never done to any King or Queen of this Realm; and so going forwards, they brought the King and Queen to Westminster-Hall, where the King placing himself upon his Throne, and all his Nobles standing about him, one, in the Kings behalf, as his Speaker, gave the Citizens thanks for the great Honour they had done him, and the Princely Presents which they had bestowed upon him; and then they being commanded every man to fall to his business, and that in the next Parliament they should have their final Answer, they departed with great joy: And thus far this Author makes his Report of what happened upon the afore-menti∣oned occasion. After this Reconciliation, by the means and methods be∣fore recited, the Citizens followed their Imployments peaceably, having several Grants and smunities added to the former; as also, when King Richard was Deposed by Henry Duke of Lancaster, Son to John of Gaunt, the Citizens, by siding with the Conqueror, preserved their Charter and Liberties; as likewise, during his Reign, who took the Rule of the Kingdom upon him, by the Name of Henry the 4th. After him succeeded his Son, Henry the Fifth, into whose fa∣vour the Citizens highly Ingratiated themselves, dealing likewise faithfully with his Son, Henry the Sixth, till such time as Edward the Fourth became Conqueror; at which time they neglected him, as thinking it safest to sail with the Wind of Power: During his Reign, they continued peace∣able, having many of their former Charters and Grants confirmed, though not without considerable summs of mo∣ney on the parts of the City. King Richard the Third, being a Usurper, was obliged to make the Citizens his Friends, for the better support
of his Dignity; so that they lived quietly during his Reign, as also, during the Reign of King Henry the Seventh; but in the Ninth year of Henry the Eighth, these following Di∣sturbances happened. The City of London being greatly Infested with Stran∣gers, who notwithstanding, the Priviledges and Charters granted, did use all manner of Handicrafts, and had such Licenses to vend their Manufactures, that the Citizens were greatly Impoverished; nor was that all, for they being Im∣boldened by relying upon the favour of the Courtiers, o∣penly abused the Citizens, not only with reproachful words, but likewise by Stroaks; and amongst the rest, one Fran∣cis D'Bard a Lumbard, causing a Citizens Wife to convey her Husbands Plate and other Goods, to his house, he there kept her, and would by no means restore her, although an Action was brought against him. These, and such like matters, stirred up the Citizens Indig∣nation against the Strangers; but above all, one John Lincoln a Broaker, who having drawn up a Bill of Grievances, with it he went to Dr. Standish, and desired him to read it in his Pulpit at the Spittle, (he being to Preach there on the Munday in Easter-Week;) but he like a Wise Man, and good Subject, considering of what evil consequence it might prove, refused it; upon which, Lincoln went to Dr. Bele, who was to Preach there on the Tuesday, and so prevailed with him, that he openly read it, the Contents being these. The Substance of the Bill of Complaint, Read by Dr. Bele, at the SPITTLE. TO all you, the VVorshipful Lords and Masters of this City, that will take Compassion on the poor People, your Neighbours; as also, of the great and insufferable Hurts, Losses, and Hindrances, whereof proceedeth the extream pover∣ty to all the Kings Subjects that inhabit within this City and
the Suburbs thereof; for so it is, that the Aliens and Stran∣gers eat the Bread from the Fatherless Children, and take the Living from the Artificers, and the Intercourse from all Mer∣chants, whereby Poverty is so increased, that every one be∣waileth the Misery of the other; for Crafts-men be brought to Beggery, and Merchants to Neediness; wherefore the Pre∣mises considered, the Redress must be of the Commons, knit and united to one part; and as the hurt and dammages grieveth all men, that they set their willing power for the Remedy, and not to suffer the said Aliens so highly in their Wealth, and the Natural born men of this Kingdom to come to Poverty. Of this Letter or Bill, there was more, but the Dr. would read no farther, finding it greatly tended to Sedition, by stirring up and exasperating the hot-headed multitude a∣gainst Strangers, yet he took a Text to the purpose, viz. The Heaven of Heavens is the Lords, but the Earth hath he given to the Sons of Men. And thereupon went on to en∣courage the people to stand up for their Callings and Im∣ployments, insinuating the Lawfulness of fighting for, and defending what was their Right, saying; That the Birds defended their Nests with their Bills and Claws; as also, the wild Beasts of the Forrests their Dens. This, and some other occasions of offence, that ministered themselves so inflamed, the Youths and a certain company of Deboist persons, who hoped for Plunder if it came to a Tumultuous Insurrection, that on the 28th of April, they gathered together in small Companies, and quarrel'd with such Strangers as they met in the Streets, beating and throwing them in the Kennels; insomuch that notice being given, the Lord Mayor sent and apprehended the chief Authors of such Incivilities; viz. Stephen Studly a Skinner, Bets, Stevenson, and divers others, who were imprisoned: Whereupon a Rumor (without any certain Author) was spread, That on the May-day following, the City would Rise & slay all the Aliens; of which, the Kings
Council having notice, they sent for the Lord Mayor and some of the Aldermen, telling them what had been report∣ed to them, advising them to look well to the City, and be in a readiness to suppress any Riotous Assembly, which they promised to do, and so departed. Being arrived at Guild-Hall, the Mayor Assembled the Court of Aldermen to consider what course was most con∣venient to be taken; and after many debates, concluded that every Alderman should take charge of his respective Ward; and that notice should immediately be given to e∣very Master, to keep in their Servants till Nine of the Clock the next morning, upon pain of his being imprison∣ed if he were found abroad, and so they broke up. After this Commandment, in the Evening as Sir John Mundie (one of the Aldermen) was going home, he found two young men in Cheapside, playing at Cudgels, and a great company standing about them, whereupon he, in the Kings Name, commanded them to depart to their respective homes, but they refusing, he ordered one of the most re∣solute to be carryed to the Compter; whereupon his Fel∣lows came to his Rescue, crying, Out Prentices and Clubs; whereupon the doors flew open on every side, and out came a number of Armed Youths, who altogether setting up a cry, a great multitude gathered, insomuch that the Alderman and his followers, were forced to flye, for by Eleven of the Clock that Evening, there were no less then seven hundred gathered in a company of all sorts, by whose Shouting they still increased, there coming at least 300 more out of St. Pauls Church-yard, who had no sooner joyned them, but they went and broke up the Compters, releasing not only those that were in Custody of their own gang, but likewise a considerable number of other Priso∣ners; and from thence they went to Newgate, where en∣tring by force, they delivered the rest of their Compani∣ons, without any regard to the Lord Mayor and Sheriffs,
who were come thither, and made Proclamation in the Kings Name, that every one should depart to their re∣spective homes. Then away they went to St. Martins-Le-Grand, which at that time was Inhabited for the most part, by Strangers, where they were met by Sir Thomas Moor, and others, who advized them to desist, but nothing was obeyed, for whilst he was Treating with them, the Strangers threw Stones, Bats, and scalding Water, out of their Windows; inso∣much that several honest Persons were hurt, and amongst the rest, one Nicholas Downs, a Serjeant at Arms, who in a fury cry'd, Down with 'um; whereupon the Rabble broke up the doors, and spoiled about 20 Houses, not discerning between the Goods of Aliens and Natives. From thence they went to Cornhill, where they com∣mitted the like Outrages upon the Houses of French-men, Lumbards, and others, that dwelt within the Gate of one Mr. Mutas, called Green-Gate; this Man being by Birth a Pickard, and a great promoter of the Forraign∣ers Trade and Manufacturies in England, for which he had (past doubt) been slain, had he fallen into the hands of the Rabble; but finding him not, they Riffled his House, and carried thence, things of great price: And thus they continued to range from place to place till Eleven a Clock the next day, which was the first of May, but by Three of the Clock they were many of them dispersed; upon which, the Watches of the City being in a readiness, se∣veral of them were Apprehended and committed Prisoners to the Tower, Compters, and Newgate; but they were for the most part the young Fry, the Knaves that had set them on, (with such Rich Bootys as they desired,) timely with∣drawing themselves. About 5 of the Clock, the Earls of Shrewsbury and Sur∣ry, Thomas Dokercie, Lord of St. Johns, and George Nevill, Lord of Avergavenny, with their Attendants, came into the
City, having at least 600 Men in their company, but whe∣ther for fear of their approach or otherwise, the Rioters were all dispersed, yet some of the Prisoners were brought before them in the Guild-Hall, and Examined; as also Dr. Bele, for the Seditious Sermon he Preached, upon which he was committed Prisoner to the Tower. A while after the King issued out a Commission of Oyer and Terminer, for the Tryal of the Offenders, directed to the Duke of Norfolk, and divers other Lords; as also to the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, Justices, and others; so that the Duke came into the City, attended by 1300 Men in Arms, and in the Guild-Hall Examined the matter: yet upon Ex∣amination it did not appear that there had been any for∣mer Meetings, but that it happened rather by chance, un∣less what Lincoln had done therein, by stirring up the peo∣ples hatred against Strangers. After this they went to the House of the Lord Chief Justice Fineux, Seituate in Fleet-street, there to adjudge and determine the matter; where, when the Judges and the Kings Council had well considered the Statute Anno Tertio of Henry the Fifth, in Relation to the Breach of Leagues which they said was manifestly done by the abuse offered to Merchants, Strangers, and Reteiners to Forreign Am∣bassadors; they concluded that all Persons who were actu∣ally in the Insurrection, aiding, abetting, or encouraging the same, were Guilty of High-Treason. The business being brought to this pass, they Adjourned to Guild-Hall, where on the 2d. of May, the Offenders were brought before them and Indicted, as well for the Insurrection, as the several Robberies that were Committed during the Uproar, to which they pleaded Not Guilty; a great many of them not exceeding 14 years of Age, yet were there amongst them, Laborours, Husband-men, and others, that were not of the City, the whole number a∣mounting to 278 Persons; amongst whom was John Lincoln,
who was Indicted as the principal Contriver of the said Insurrection, to which he pleaded Not Guilty, and had three days given him to prepare for his defence; so that for that day there were no farther Proceedings; but upon the day affixed, the Duke of Norfolk and the Earl of Surry, came again, attended with 2000 Armed men, who kept the Streets, and the Prisoners being brought, upon their Try∣als, 13 were found Guilty, and adjudged to be Hanged; whereupon Eleven pair of Gallows were set up in divers parts of the City; when at the day appointed for Exe∣cution, the Prisoners were brought forth with Ropes about their Necks and Arms, and in the presence of the Lord Edmund, Son to the Duke of Norfolk, (to whom the charge of seeing it done was committed) they were Executed without any respect to their Youth. On the 17th of May, Lincoln, Sherwin, and the two Bettses, being Brothers, with several of their Confederates, were found Guilty, and received Sentence as the former; when within a short time after, they were drawn upon Hurdles to the Standard in Cheapside, where Lincoln was first Executed, but as the rest were about to be turn'd off, a Reprieve came from the King to stay Execution; upon which the people Shouted, crying, God Save the King; and thereupon the Prisoners were carryed back to Prison, there to attend the Kings farther pleasure. After this, all the Armed Men which before had kept Watch in the City, were withdrawn, which gave the Ci∣tizens hope that the Kings displeasure towards them was not so great as themselves conceived; whereupon on the 11th of May, the King Riding at his Mannor of Greenwich, the Mayor, Recorder, and divers Aldermen, went in Mourning Gowns to wait upon him; and having admit∣tance to the Privy-Chamber door; and after they had at∣tended there for some time, the King, attended with seve∣ral of his Nobles, came forth; whereupon they falling
upon their Knees, the Recorder in the Name of the rest, spake as followeth. Most Natural, Benign, and our Soveraign Lord, we well know that your Grace is highly displeased with us of your City of London, for the great Riot done and Committed there; wherefore we assure your Grace, that none of us, nor no Honest Person, were condescending to that Enormi∣ty; yet we, our Wives and Children, every hour lament that your Favour should be taken from us; and forasmuch as Light and Idle Persons were the doers of the same, we most humbly beseech your Grace to have Mercy on us, for our negligence and compassion on the Offenders for their Offences and Trespasses. To which the King Replyed; Truly you have highly displeased and offended us, and therefore you ought to wail and be sorry for the same; and whereas you say that you the Substantial Citizens were not consenting to what happened, it appeareth to the contrary; for you never moved to let them, nor stirred to fight with those whom you say were so small a number of light persons; wherefore we must think, and you cannot deny, but that you did wink at the matter; therefore at this time, we will neither grant you our Favour nor Good-will, nor to the Offenders mercy, but resort to our Lord Chancellor, and he shall make you an Answer, and declare to you our pleasure. At this Speech of the Kings, the Citizens departed very sorrowful, but having notice that the King intended to be at his Pallace of Westminster on the 22d of May, they resolved to repair thither, which they did according∣ly, though not without the appointment of Cardinal Wol∣sey, who was then Lord Chancellor; when as a Cloth of Estate being placed at the upper-end of Westminster-Hall, the King took his place, and after him the Cardinal, the Dukes of Norfolk and Suffolk, the Earls of Wilt-shire, Surry, Shrewsbury, and Essex, with several others, the Lord Mayor,
Recorder, and Aldermen, together with many of the Commons, attending in their Liveries; when about Nine of the Clock, order was given for the bringing forth the Prisoners, which was accordingly done; so that in they came in their Shirts, bound together with Ropes, and Hal∣ters about their Necks, to the number of 400 Men and Eleven Women, one after another, which fight so moved several of the Nobility, that they became earnest Interces∣sors to the King for their pardon. When silence was made, and they were all come into the Kings presence, the Cardinal sharply Rebuked the Mayor, Aldermen, and Commonalty, for their Negli∣gence, and then addressing his Speech to the Prisoners, he told them, That for their Offences against the Laws of the Realm, and against his Majesties Crown and Dig∣nity, they had deserved Death; whereupon they all set up a piteous cry, saying; Mercy Gracious Lord, Mercy; which so moved the King, that at the earnest Intreaty of the Lords, he pronounced them pardoned; upon which, giving a great Shout, they threw up their Halters towards the Roof of the Hall, crying, God Save the King: When this News was bruited abroad, several that had been in the Insurrection and had escaped, came in upon their own accords with Ropes about their Necks, and received the benefit of the Kings pardon; after which the Cardinal gave them several good Exhortations, tending to Loyalty and Obedience, and so dismissed them, to their no small joy; and within a while after, the Gallowses that were set in the several parts of the City, were taken down, which so far pleased the Citizens, that they ex∣pressed infinite thanks to the King for his Clemency. This Company was called the Black VVaggon, and the day whereon this Riot and Insurrection hapned, bears the name of Ill-May-day to these our present times. And thus, have you heard how the Citizens escaped the Kings dis∣pleasure,
and were again received into favour; though, as it is thought, not without paying a considerable Summ of Money to the Cardinal to stand their Friend, for at that time he was in such Power, that he did all with the King. This Broil being over, the Citizens lived in Peace all the days of King Henry the Eighth, lending him at divers times, great Summs of Money to carry on his Wars against France, and upon other occasions. During the Reign of his Son King Edward, likewise, all things were preserved peaceably within the City, a good Understanding being for the most part between them and their Prince, insomuch that the City greatly flourished under his Pious Goverment, he giving to them his Pallace of Bridewell, Christ's-Hospital, St. Bartholo∣mews Hospital, and that of Bethelem, with an Annual Re∣venue for the relief of the Poor; together with several Grants, Priviledges, and Immunities; so that to gratifie him, they consented to the Establishing the Lady Jane Gray, his Couzen, in the Succession, and after his De∣cease were assisting at her Coronation, promising to stand by her with their Lives and Fortunes, although within a short time after, they left her to the mercy of her merciless Enemy Queen Mary, by that means think∣ing to appease her for the wrong they had done, in de∣claring her Illegitimate; but that availed not, for she was never throughly Reconciled to the Citizens during the whole course of her Reign, by reason of the Affronts they frequently offered, and the Revolt of 600 of them from the Duke of Norfolk to Wyate, upon the Dukes approach to Rochester; so that she still kept an Eye up∣on the City, and often determined with her self, to take away, or abridge the Charter; and for that purpose, consulted with her Council, and had proceeded therein, had not her death prevented it.
When her Glorious Sister, Queen Elizabeth, came to the Crown, she greatly Honoured the City, and was as intirely beloved of all the Citizens, unless a few Factious persons, who were scattered here and there, whom by wholsom Laws, she endeavoured to restrain, they other∣wise aspiring to an unparalel'd height of Insolency. After her death, King James of ever Blessed Me∣mory, Uniting the Crowns of England and Scotland, was most joyfull received by the Citizens of London, and much augmented their Priviledges, freely confirming their Charter, which they delivered up to his Majesty for that purpose, and continued during his most Christian Reign, in great Prosperity and Peace. But in the fourth year of his Son, Charles the First, of ever blessed Memory, Anno. 1628. on the 14th of July this following Disturbance happened; One Dr. Lamb (by some reputed to a Necromancer, though many were, and are to this day, of a contrary opinion) comeing through Cheapside, where being espyed by some Ill-affect∣ed persons, who envyed his great parts, they cryed out, D. Lamb, Dr. Lamb; whereupon a great number of Lewd Fellows came running with Staves, and such like mischievous Weapons; which the Dr. perceiving, and finding that it was time to shift for himself, he made his retreat down Wood-street, and there got into a house, and so far prevailed with the people, that they shut the doors against the Rabble, who were by this time in∣creased to 3 or 400. besieging the house, and demanding the Dr. instantly to be delivered up to them, or else they would fire or pull it down; but the people a long time resisted them, and endeavoured to perswade them to depart, in hopes that the Sheriffs would come with a power to receive the Dr. under a safe Conduct, but when they perceived all the Windows broak, and that the multitude had forced the outward door, and no hopes
of any rescue at hand, they were forced to deliver him up to save the spoiling of their Goods. When the Rabble had got him into their hands, some took him by the Legs, and others by the Armes, and so dragging him along the Streets, crying, Lamb, Lamb, the Conjurer, the Conjurer; every one kicking and striking him that were nearest. Now whilst this Tumult lasted, and the City was in an Uproar, the News of what had passed came to the Kings ear, who immediately ordered his Guard to make ready, and taking some of the chief Nobility, he came in person to appease the Tumult; when in St. Pauls Church-yard he met the Inhumane Villains dragging the Dr. along, and after the Knight-Marshal had proclaimed silence, who was but ill obeyed, the King, like a good Prince, mildly exhorted and perswaded them to keep his Peace, and deliver up the Dr. to be Tryed accord∣ing to Law, and that if his offence which they charged him with should appear, he should be punished accordingly; commanding them to disperse and depart every one to his own home; but the Insolent Varlets answered, That they had Judged him already, and thereupon pulled him Limb from Limb, or at least, so Dislocated his Joynts, that he instantly dyed. The King seeing no good was to be done with such people, and wanting Forces sufficient at that time to chas∣tize their Insolence, he returned to his Pallace, and in a while after sent for the Heads of the City, as the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, Sheriffs, &c. and blamed them exceed∣ingly for not raising the power of the City to prevent the Murther of his Subject, and chastize the Insolence of the Riotous Mortherers; but they excused themselves, say∣ing, they had no notice of it till such time that the mul∣titude was too great to oppose; yet his Majesty was so incenced, that he ordered Commissioners to inquire into
the matter, upon the return of whose Report, the City was Fined 6000l. and on the 16th of the same Instant, several were committed Prisoners that were present at the Riot; nor could the City appease the Kings Anger, till such time as they submitted themselves, and confessed their sorrow for what had happened. As to the Intestine Tumults and Disturbances, made by the City Uulgar, and those that incenced them to such un∣natural attempts as happened (during the Reign of this blest and for ever to be admir'd Monarch) I shall rather pass them over in silence then insist upon them, for as much as they will rather exasperate mens minds, then any ways tend to the scope & end for which this Treatise was written; for we doubt not but there formerly has been, and now are, as Loy∣al and Worthy persons Inhabiting the City, as any the Na∣tion affords; and therefore for their sakes, I shall proceed no farther as to those particulars. After the happy Restauration of His most Sacred Majesty who now is, (whose Established Throne may ever-wakeful Angels guard, and Heaven make his Reign long and happy over us, in spight of all the malice of his Foes) the City prospered, & to this day so well prospers under the benign influence of so good a Prince, that no City in the World can boast the same; having received so many favours and Imunities from his Princely Bounty, that the like it has not for these 300 y. past been, received from any King of Engl. his Predecessor; therefore how grateful ought we to be to such condescending Majesty, and yet how little some regard the same. Ingratum si Dixeris omnia Dixeris. But to conclude, I shall only give the Reader a view of the Coppy of the Writt of Quo Warranto in English, as near as possible the Original Translation from the Lattin will bear; which was served upon the City, to inquire by what Autho∣rity they lay claim to, and use, their Liberty, Franchises, and Priviledges, which take as followeth.
