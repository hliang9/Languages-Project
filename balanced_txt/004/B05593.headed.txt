C R HONI SOIT QVI MAL Y PENSE royal blazon or coat of arms PROCLAMATION, Discharging Trade and Commerce with the City of London, and other Places of the Kingdom of England, suspected of the Plague. At Edinburgh, the twenty one of December, one thousand six hundred sixty five. THe Lords of His Majesties Privy Council, taking to their serious consideration, that albeit by the infinit mercy of GOD, this Kingdom hath been hitherto preserved from the plague of Pesti∣lence, which hath long continued at London, and broken out in many other Towns and Places of the Kingdom of England; Yet the danger and fear of infection is as great as it hath been heretofore, by the resore of many People and Merchants to the City of London, and other Places suspected, for beginning Commerce and Trade, and adventuring to bring into this Kingdom all Commodities as formerly, albeit the Plague is not yet altogether ceased, and that all Goods and Merchandise to be imported from thence, may be yet justly suspected: And that Merchants and other Traffickers may conceive, that the Act and Proclamation of the twelfth of July last, whereby all Trade and Commerce betwixt this Kingdom and the City of London, and other suspected Places, was discharged till the first of November last, is now no more in force after the elapsing of the said first of November; albeit by the said former Act and Proclamation, the said restraint and prohibition is not only laid on till the said first of November, but ay and while it should be expresly taken off by another Act and Proclamation. Therefore, that none pretend ignorance, they of new ratifie and approve the foresaid Act, in the whole Heads and Clauses thereof, and ordains all parties concerned to give full and exact obedience thereto, and declares the same to stand and be of full force, untill the first day of March next to come, in the year of GOD, one thousand six hundred and sixty six, and longer, ay and while the same be discharged: With certification, if any person whatsomever shall contraveen the same, they shall be lyable to the whole pains and penalties therein contained, to be inflicted without mercy. And ordains these presents to be printed, and published by Macers or Messengers at Armes, at the Mercat-cross of Edinburgh, Peer and Shoar of Lieth, Mercat-crosses of Dunce and Jedburgh, and other places needfull, that none pretend ignorance.
