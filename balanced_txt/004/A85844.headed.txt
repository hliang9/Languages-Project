The Bloody Court; OR, The Fatall Tribunall: BEING A brief History, and true Narrative, of the strange Designs, wicked Plots, and Bloody Conspiracies, carryed on by the most sordid'st, vile, and Usurping Tyrants, in these late Years of Oppressions, Tyranny, Martyrdome, and Persecutions: DISCOVERING, I. The Poysonous Asps, King-killing Basilisks, weeping Hypocrites, and devouring Caterpillars, who in their Damnable Treasons have far surpassed the Powder-Conspiracy, secretly contriving, but openly acting the Murther of our late Gracious King Charles, the ruine of all the Royal Issue, the everthrow of all our Laws, the blowing up of all Parliaments, the subverting of the whole State of Government; and the setting up of a consused Babel, watered with the blood of the KING and His People. II. An Exact Description of these hard-hearted Belshazzars, infamous Impostors, Luciferian Brats, wicked Schismaticks, cruel Hypocrites, desperate Usurpers, Damnable Blood-suckers, both of King and Nobles, who with Iron Hands, and Adamantine Hearts, would also have pull'd our present Lord and Soveraign out of the Arms and Embraces of His Loyal and Liege Sub∣jects. III. The Bloody Tragedy of all Tragedies, against King, Lords, and Commons: the several Scenes, presenting their most horrid Villanies; and the most barba∣rous and Tyrannical Massacre that was ever heard of since the World began, consted amongst the Grandees of the Independent Sword-men, against the chief Royalists and Presbyterians, both Nobles, Gentry, and Citizens; with the manner how it was prevented; and the exposing of these Bff-Grandees, and insing proud Officers, to their Needles, Hammers, Lasts, Slings, Carts, and Flails; and all true Subjects to enjoy their Rights.

The Bloody Court; OR, The Fatal Tribunal. THe Crown of England was the ancientest Christian Crown in the World and that which had those two famous Pil∣lars, Religion and Law, the purest and best in the world to under-prop it, which made it so Renowned: But our late Vsurping Tyrant, and his King-killing Basilisks, holding a Con∣fedaracy with the Popish Faction, endeavoured a supplanting of the Magistracy and Ministry, the Laws of the Land; and the Religion of the Church of England, had not the Honest Royalist, and Sober-min∣ded Presbyter proved a strong Defence and Fortress against that Blood-sucking and Iesuitical Factin, who lay so occultly at the Helm of Government, and pretended (so cunningly) to act all for the Pro∣testant Religion: yet under the Vizard of Hypocrisie and Rebellion, they pretend a Reformation▪ but through a Sea of innocent Blood, as we shall plainly describe in the following Historical discurse, with is their setting up a High Court of Inustice, and a pretended Council of State, to be two during High-Courts: The one, for the ordering the great affairs of the Kingdom; the other to judge and determine mat∣ters Criminal. Here old England became visibly in its Government a new Spain: And it's worthy of observation to note, That Corne Joyce, having with a party of souldiers (by Order from Cromwel) sei∣zed on the Kings person at Newport in the Isle of Wight, by breaking open the door in the night when the King was in Bed, and taking him thence, and bringing him over the water to Hurst Castle, Colonel Har∣rison was by Cromwel sent with a strong party of horse to guard the King, from thence to Windsor. And immediately the their bloo∣dy Court was erected: and the Trial of Our gracious Soveraign pro∣claimed: which terrible Eccho, resounded with so much horrour and detestation▪ in the ears of all Loyal hearts that they abhorred the very thoughts of so monstrous and barbarous an Act. And notwithstanding,
all Remoras being removed (wh right under the proceeding of the Popish F in the tting in  that ever was committed upon the face of the Earth, since the ∣ring of our blessed Lord and ) to work they goe, having the King in their clutches again he being the onely Protestant King in the World; this good King had neither Wife nor Children admitted to come near him, nor Friend, nor Chaplain, nor Servant of his own, wherein he could take the least comfort, either in discourse, or in behol∣ding their countenances: He had no body to speak his mind unto, no body to sympathize with him, or so much as to bestow a sight upon him, in his solitary and disconsolate condition, but like another David, when his Wife and Children were gone, and he had no House to put his head in; Then did those about him speak it openly, That they would put Him to Death, and that not in a passion, but soberly, as if it were a pious meritorious work, to kill the onely pious Protestant King in the World. The good King through his great sufferings and unheard of afflictions both of body and mind, wherewith God was pleased to exercise him, became a pattern of patience, and will be so to all posterity; For un∣der all those reproaches which he heard with his Ears, and read with his Eyes, against his Crown, Dignity, Person, Name, and Posterity; notwithstanding the violence offered to him in the midst of the Night, in breaking into his Chamber, and taking him out of his Bed, carrying him partly by Land and partly by Sea to Hurst Castle, from thence to Windsor, from Windsor to St. James; in all which he was not heard so much as to speak evil of his Adversaries, or to use a bitter word, or demean himself impatiently; but as a Lamb leaving to the slaughter, so meek was he in those merciless Butchers hand. At St. James he was kept until the Scaffold were erected in Westminster-hall, where it was reported that not onely the Officers cast foul reproaches of Ty∣ranny and Murder into his face, dayly and hourly, but oft times the Common-souldiers by blowing of Tobacco (which he could not indure) by beating of Drums at unseasonable hours close by him, did extreamly abuse him; besides there most uncivil words to his very face, yet was he patient under all, being abused and reviled, he reviled not again. At last Colonel Tomlinson was the Kings Goaler, whose high commenda∣tions above all other men in the Army, was this; That he dealt ci∣vily with the King. On January the 20th. 1648. The pretended High Court of Iustice sate, a certain man called Bradshaw, a Counsellor at Law, who being
a man of a fluent Tongue, and bold, and it seems alwayes a bitter man against the ing, was found out, and by promises of great prefer∣ment and of matteas, was easily perswaded to be the man to act the part of a Iudge, or rather of a God, and take upon him to Iudge and Condemn the Protestant King: This Fellow they made a Searlet Gaon for him, that he might look like some body above his Fellows; they gave him also a strange name, they Dy'd him in Red, and dipped him by the name of my Lord President! yet he had his name before he had his Red coat, for it seems they were in such ha to dispatch this pi∣ons king, who stood in the way to hinder their designes, that the bu∣siness was come to the last day, ere the Taylor, as I take it, had done that garment, which made him the Scarlet coloured Beast (he was full of Blasphemy before) this Blasphemous Beast was made the Iudge, and one Cook, a Fellow that had formerly ed out of the Kingdome, whether his knavery, or Poverty, or both drove him, I cannot tell, but one or both I am sure: This Fellow (as I am in∣formed by a Gentleman of worth) was forced beyond Sea to beg for his Food; being an English-man, and having Latine enough to beg his living by, he resorted to the Colledges of English Jesuites, where like Perfius's Parot, his Belly taught his Tongue his Fluencie. I menti∣on this onely, what intrest the Jesuites had in this fellow by pre in∣gagements: This Fellow, when he asked for Bread, they gave him Scorpious doubtless, which made the Popish Faction chuse him above all others, to be a Solicitor General to mannage a Charge of Treas against a Protestant King in his own Dominions: Be consident, a true Protestant dares not be so base a Traytor, nor any, but an Apo∣state English-man, be so base a scandal to his Nation, but they were hall fellow well met at this Court; here might a man have beheld the iuice of that Toad Mariana, swelling up each Ʋillain in the Court to spet Venom in the sootiess Face of his Royal Majesty. My intention in this short Discourse is not to eatch Womens Affe∣ctions, but to inform mans Iudgements, otherwise it were very easie, I think to make the seniest heart to spring a floud of Tears, or split in shivers, to read this Tragedy. Turns Natures order upside down, transform how you can to make a prodigy, it cannot he so horrid, or so dismal a spectacle, as here I could not present the Reader. Could you see a company of ugly filthy Goal-birds, with their Fer∣ors on, rise up, lay hands upon the innocent Iudge: and clap their Fetters on his Leggs, place him at their Barr, call him the Male∣or,
and pass the Sentence of Death upon him? Could you sée this Iudge wich patience submit to the ugly and unjust Sentence of thefs Bloody Rogues, and meekly suffer himself to be led to the place of Ex∣ecution, and there have his innocent Head sbered from his Shoulders? Yet there is ten times a more horrid sight to be seen in this, then that can be: But I must pass it over, least when I get into it, I know not how to get out, onely take these sew touches, which is well wor∣thy of observation. There was never so much Majesty and meekness seen together in a∣ny man that was but a meer man, ue the Word was made that we can rd or hor of, as was in this Ki; this cause much the more, by how much be iued his Enemies reproaches, which were mo bit∣ter and cruel: He had so much Majesty at his first appearing at the Court before them, that he made his Iudge tremble at his apoar, and so much méekness in his replyes to their reproaches, that it then thawed the frozen Bawels of those rigid Clowns his Iudges, to a kind of inward renctancy; ask some of their Consciences whether this is not true? they do confess it. It should séem some of them had been enquiring of Lilly the Sorcerer whither they should take away his life, to whom he reped. That if the Head of his Staff fell off, His Head would fal off also: And the ∣ry first day the King was brought before them, they hd Bemiched the Head of his staff to fall off, which made them that were his Iudges, con∣fident of success in their Treason. They drew a formal Charge against the King, wherein they charged him as a Tyrant, a Traytor, a Murderer, and a Publick Enemy to the Commonwealth: After the Charge was read, Bradshaw desired him that he would answer to his Charge. The King with an amiable grave countenance beholding his Ene∣mies, and joyning with it such méek language▪ so full of déep and solid Reason, made his Enemies admire and applaud him, and his friends to wéep bitterly for him. The King would not (because in Conscience he could not) acknowledge their Authority; if he had, he had betray∣ed the Liberties of his People; For if the King should have granted (which was the onely thing they desired) the legality of their Court; what Subject durst have denied it? Therefore the King said (and that truly) he stood for his Peoples & Liberties, and the Peace of his Countrey, not allowing to have his Subjects cut off illegally. It was admirable to sée this Heroick Prince bear up indauntedly under all thoso discouragements with which he was oppressed: He had
at his Right hand Cook calling for Iustice against the Traytor, the Murderer, the Tyrant, and the Pubick Euemy of the Kingdom; on the Right hand and on the left, at least enty Halbertéers; directly before him Bradshaw s ily and prt ptuosly interrogating, revi∣ling, and slaeing of ; behind , in Westminster-hall, there were thousands of Souldiers, who when the King turned his face, and looked down on them, they cryed out aloud (being taught before hand what to say) Justice, Justice, Justice. The King has brought Four rimes to his publick Tryal before these Bloody-minded-men, and still benied their Authority, and proved it (as well he might) to be no legal Authority, whereupon the two next dayes they sate not publickly, but privately in the Painted Chamber, where they were drawing up the Sentence to Murder the most spotless and innocent King. I should have mentioned in due place, that when the Commons had Voted the High Court of Iustice to sit, they adjourned themselves un∣til their time of sitting was out; and also how Cromwel a little before they took this Traytorous Enterprize in hand, called for a Fast, to seek God in a business of so great concernment: This Fast the House kept, and the Souldiers at White-hall. At the same time did the Presbyte∣rian Ministers Fast and Pray to prevent the mischeifs that Cromwel was acting against the Church and State, the Magistracy, and the Mi∣nistry of England. After Cromwel had done Fasting, they presently procée ded to the Tryal of the King; He and Ireton who had promised the King to establish him, and they were the veriest Knaves and. Vil∣lains that ever-lived (They said) if they did not perform every tittle that they promised him; these two errand Knaven and Villains (from their own mouths I judge them so were there in my sight at the Court of Iustice to take away his life. The Citizens of London and the Presbiterian Ministers (for mond lse irred to save the Kings life) hearing that they were sitting in the Painted Chamber, to draw up the Sentence of Death against the King, went boldly to General Fairfax and acquainted him with the sin, and the dangerous consequence of such a horrid Murder: The General was fully convinced of it, and thereupon resolved to call a General Rende∣vous, and in the head of the Army to Declare against it; in the mean while he resolved to pot to the High Court of Iustice, and stop all their Procéedings against the King. Therefore he sought for his Lieutenant General Cromwel, and ding him, told him, he was much troubled and unsatisfied in his
mind about the proceedings of the ich Court of Iustice against the ng and therefore came on purpose to vee t to preced no fur∣ther until the House tiand sate again: Cromel told his General, That he also had the same trouble upon his spirit concerning the saving of the Kings life, they were now about his lift, he did confess, and what to do he knew not; onely  said, he saw God answeting their prayers, and going before their ets: They had sought God by Fa∣ding, and those of cnt opinion had sought God by Fasting, but God seemen to cross their prayers, and they seemed (meaning the Presbiterians, to him to he in the dark, and deserted. Let us there∣fore (said he) as we have seen the Providence of God, answering our prayers hitherto when we have sought him so let us before we pro∣ any further in such a weighty business, goe first to God in prayer, and wait; rths God may be seen in his Providence whilest we are at prayer: the General was content to use all pious means: Hereup∣on Cromwel stops the General from prohibiting the Court of Iustice, to proceed any  against the King until prayer was done in the mean time Cromwel privately sends Ireton from White-hall to the Painted Ch (to them there drawing up the Sentence) to ∣nish it, Seal it, and thwith disperse themselves: whilest Ireton goes, Cromwel keeps the General at prayer, and holds him there  than upon his knows) almost two hours, till Ireton returned again and th Cromwel (who prayed all that while) drew to a conclusion; Cromwel pretending now in all haste to goe to the Court of Iustice, to stop procéedings against the King, was told by Ireton in the Generals hearing, that they had signed the Sentence against the King, and were then, even then newly broke up, and gone to their several homes, Cromwel pretended that this was immediate Providence, and an e∣minent and gracious return of prayer and we ought not in any wise (said he) but to admire and be silent, and wait upon the Providence of God, and sée what the issue will be, for certain it must be glorious when it comes in the Arms of prayer. With such and such Saint e rorssions, did by cozen the honest General, and made him return, fru∣trate of his purpose, under pretence of using holy means to attain his own purpose. Cromwel by this Religions cheat haring put the business past recal∣ling, pretended to those Ladies and Gentlewomen that solicited him about the preservation of  Kings life, That none was s desirous to save the King as he, and therefore gave out, that the worst they should  to him, was onely to bring him on the Scaffold to er him, that
he might yeeld to those things that wer for the good of the Kingdome Thus the Officers of the Army had leave to tell their Souldiers▪ and hen thought no otherwise, as they solemaly vowed and swore after∣wards. But to the Hory in order as it lieth: January the 27th. being Saturday, the Hh Court of Iustice (as e called themselves) met, and now Bradshaw had got on his Redcoat, and  he comes, at∣tended with 67 of is party that sate with him: a angst whom were (those two Sons of Perdition) Cromwel and Ireton. The King came from Sir Robert Cotton's house Grded with Souldiers, and the Mace before him; when he came into the Court and turned himself a∣bout, looks down the Hall, and every way about him; the Souldiers (who were now taught a new Lesson) cryed out, Execution, Execu∣tion, in the Kings Ears; to astonish him with the horrid thoughts of sadden death. The King perceiving by the Red Gown on Bradshaws back, and by the cry of the Souldiers, that they intended that day to pass their Sen∣tence of Death on him, desired to be heard; and the rather, because it did conduce excéeding much to the good of the Kingdom, for the peace of it and the good of the People in it; which he protested he aime at more then his own particular good: Therefore he desired to be heard (before they passed Sentence on him) before the Lords and Commons in the Pained Chamber: there he had▪ something to say to them which apy concerned both and that which would be worth the hearing it not, he gave them leave to be the Iudges, and lay the blame on him: However such a delay (he said) could not be prejudicial to them and this demand he thought, being it so much concerned the well-fare of the Kingdom, and the life of a King it might easily be granted him▪ but it they refused to grant him this reasonable request, he would protest a∣gainst them as men that were not reall for the Liberty of the Subject and Peace of the Kingdom. The Court withdrew for half an hour▪ and then returned again with this Answer to the King. That they had been too long delayed by him already, and therefore notwithstanding all the profers of Peace to the Kingdom, and Liberty to the Subject, they were resolved to proceed to Sentence and Judgement. The King professed it was the Kingdoms welfare and peace, more een his own life, that he look  at chasfly; and a delay of a day or two thr night give Peace to the Kingdom whereas an hast I idgement way bring that trouble to the Kingdom, which the Child anboa ay re∣pent
it; And therefore (said the King) I do again out of their duty  o to God and my Countrey, desire that I may be heard by the Lords and Commons in the Painted Chamber; to this Bradshaw the President replyed, This was but that he had said before, and therefore the Court desired to hear what he would say before they did procéed to entence; this I say (said the King) that if you will hear me, I do not doubt to give satisfaction to you, and to my People, and therefore  do e qre you (as you will ader it at the Dreadful day of Iudg∣ment) that you will considr it once again. The Lord onely knowes what th King had to say to them, but it was doubtl something of great importance, and that which lay with∣in his Breast, which he would f hve rveled before he died; but these unreasonable any Bloody-mided men, whose onely design was to drink his innocent Blood, would not hear him, but after they ha exprohed him, called him the greatest of Tyrants, and used many Blasphemens Speeched against him, caused a Bold Fellow to stand us and read a Sentence, which was to sever the Royal Head of Charles Stewart, King of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland, from his Body: After it was read, said Bradshaw (standing up) this is the Sentence and Iudgement of the whole Court, at which the Court stood up: Cromwel and Ireton rising up, the two formost and readiest in the Court, though they knew themselves the very hinderers of the setiing the peace of the Kingdom, and the chief causers of the Kings ruine, in disswading him from Treating with the Commissioners of shoth Kingdoms. The King after Sentence stood up vo speak, but Bradshaw told him that after the Sentence he might not speak, neither wu'd he hear him, but gave command to the Gord to withdraw the Passoner: The King said that he might speak after Sentence and then he would have spoke, but the ard opened the Br where they put the King, and Bradshaw rese to depart, so that they sleighted the Kings words: Where∣upon the King turning himself to come forth, said, If I your King an ot suffered to speak for my self, what Justice can my People expect to have? These were the last words the King spoke in Westminster-hall, as the King passed from the C urt through the Souldiers, the Souldiers with a loud shout tryed, Execution, Execution, and with such fierce∣ness, that I which steed neat the King, trenbled with fear, least they would have Murdered him in the Hll, but it séems it was but to fright him, and distemper his well-composed Spirit: This was the hurry
of all about him immediately after the Sentence: Is the King condem∣ned? What? Is he now going to his Execution? Is it to night or the morrow morning? Thus they tryed in his Ears on purpose to am him, some they say, reviled, and mocked him, and others with indigna∣tion spit upon him, yet was he not disturbed in his Soul so much as to tread one foot awry, or to show the least discontent in his Majestick and Royal countenance. He was carried from Sir Robert Cottons to St. James, where he had the liberty of his Chaplain allowed him, who spent that last Sab∣bath of his on Earth with much comfort and joy together, all that Holy day he spent in Holy Meditations, as Hearing, Reading, and Praying, and trimming up his Celestial Spouse (his Soul) for her Celestial Bridegroom▪ which he every hour looked for. The Lords Day being done, he spent the most part of the long night in Devout Prayer, never putting of his cloaths: a worthy Lady told me, that a Souldier which Giarded him, by stealth, heard the King a∣lone at Prayer, who prayed so sweetly, so fervently, and so charitably, that he thought if ever any King had communion with God on Earth, it was he, he did confess his sin and his Families and Peoples in with much debasedness of Spirit, and prayed heartily for Remission, and for those his Persecutors pardon and for establishing of the true Prote∣stant Religion: After this manner spent he the night. The next morning being very desirous to see his Children that were in England, with much ado they were permitted to go to visit their im∣prisoned and condemned Father. At this time they  through the Kingdom in a Pamphlet, that the Presbyterian Ministers such as Mr. Calamy, Mr. Case, Mr. Love, Mr. Jenkins, &c. that they were content to have the King Tryed, Condemed, and Deposed; but not Beheaded:  I suppose, that same malicious knaves or ignorant fools brought  his for  saying, That the Presbyterians brought his Neck to the Block, and the Independents cut it off; but the  did that  themselves, and  Hugh Peters's Sermon of binding Kings in chains and Nobles in Fetters of Iron, and  the Imiprisoning. Trying, , and going about to Behead the King. The Lady Elizabeth and the Duke of Gocester being come to weep in their condemned Royal Fathers Bsome, the King with pleasant countenance and voice blessed them, and  speaking thus to the Lady Elizabeth.
SWeet heart, I am glad you are come; for though I have not time to say me to you, yet I have that to say to you which I have not to say, or leave in writing with another for you; for su is their cruelty toward me, that they will not permit me to write to you, nor any of my children. The King sing the sorrowful young Ldy weep most itery nd torment her slf wit grief he out of pity to her▪ sa: I pray thee do nt grieve nor torment thy self for me, for though I shall be put to Death to morrow, yet the Death that I shall dye will be a Glorio is Death; for I dye for the Lawes of my Kingdome and the Libertie; of my People, and the maintainance of the true Protestant Religion, in which I would have you well grounded, and therefore admonish you to read Bishop Andrews Sermons, Hookers Ecclesiasticall Policie, and Bishop Lands book against Fisher, which will ground you against Popery. I have this day forgiven all mine Enemies, and I hope God will forgive them, and I do command you, and all the rest of your Bro∣thers and Sisters to forgive them; and tell my dear Wife your Mo∣ther, that my thoughts have never straied from her, but she hath al∣wayes been next my heart, and my love shall be the same to her to my last minute: I charge you and your Brother to be obedient to her, and be sure to love your Brothers and Sisters, to whom I would have you send my Blessing, with commendation to all my Friends: And my dear Daughter, God Almighty preserve thee from all my Enemies, whom I charge you to forgive, but never to trust them; for they have been most false to me, and false to the Parliament that intrusted them, and I ear to their own Souls; and now thou art parting with thy Father (my dear Daughter) do not goe away grieving from me, for though I dye, I shall dye a Martyr, and I doubt not, but the Lord will settle my Son in my Throne, for which I am this day thrown, and and you my children will be more happy, then you could expected to have been if I had lived: All this and much more he said to the La∣dy Elizabeth, instructing the young Duke his Son, to learn betimes to serve and fear the Lord, and he would provide for him: It would have drawn water out of a Rocke-heart, to have seen the sad parting of this Solitary, Condemned, Imprisoned King, and his dear Chil∣dren. The poor Lady went away wéeping, not onely Tears, but Blood, and Blood in great abundance, so that the Physitians concluded, that she would bléed to Death. The King sadly parting with his beloved Children (for they parted
never to fée each other more). he forth with betook himself to private o∣es, knowing the time of his departing out of this World drew on a∣pace, not having many hours more to live; this night also he spent its trimming up his Lamp for to meet his Bridegroom, who was near at hand, not putting off his cloaths all night; he altogether neglected his body for the good of his precious soul. The next morning, as if the day of Iudgement had béen coue, they a∣waked him with a Trumpet, not to tell him the Resurrection was come, but to raise him up to goe to his Grave this sound was to him the less terrible, by how much the less it was unerepected, for he was quickly ready: This was on Tuesday the 30th. of January 1648. About Ten of the Cock, with a party of 500 Sudiers before the King, add a party of 500 behind him, and about 30 Partizans on each side him, he was Guarded through St. James Park to White-hall, Dr▪ Juxon being allowed to goe alonge with him as his Chapin. The King had prepared himself for the Sacrament, resolving to eat a stual Brookfall before he took his long jeuruey to the spiricual Je∣rusalem. Dr. Juxon at the Sacrament following the Protestant Liturcy of England, to the Lessons appointed for that day, the second Lessen b∣ing Matth. 27. Providence so ordeving it that Christ would not onely give himself slain (to this Royal Martyr of his) in the Sacrament for his support in his sufferings but lay before his eyes the pattern of his wer safferings for him to follow. The King asked, whether that were the Lesson appointed for the day, the Bishe told him it was, where the King exceedingly refoced, as seeing the glorious hand of his Saviour speaking as it were from Heaven to him, and resolving that doubt which he had in him, whether he had bess refuse to submit to the punishment as he did not submit to the guilt, he there prieciing how his innocent Saviour submitted to the punishment, who had no guile faund in him, reseved (being a sin∣ner) to submit willingly to the Hand of God, and to lay down his life without sturging, as his blessed Lord and Saviour had left him a pat∣ter: With much devotion, oy, and spiritual lieliness, he was obser∣ved to receive the Sacrament, after which there was a sudden messags same unto him, as it on purpose to disturb him, that he man spéedily par∣pace himself for the Glass was turned and he had but that hour near to live, which message, was as an Arrow that through the heart of the Bi∣shop, and the rish that loved the King: whereupon the King said to the Bishop, My Lord, do not you pity me, well, after one hour is expired, I shall pity you, and all the People in my Kingdom.
As he came through the Banqueting, house, there they had placêd his Cffin in his Eye, purposely to deject him, and strike him with ter∣rour when he came on the Scaffold and saw the Block, the Pullies, and Devises, which were made to bring him, as an Ore to the slaugh∣ter, and to force him to the Block, in case he resused to loy nown his Royal Neck there on: He lifted p his Eyes towores Heaven and said, I am a Sinner, and willing to submit my self to the punishing Hand of GOD; but not to the Unjust Sentence of Men. He made a Spech upth old, out of which I shall onely re∣cite this assage, because I will not be tedious. The Peoples I therty, He proves consists in Government, for the maintainance of their Government, he saith, he was condemned. Sirs, saith he, it was for this that now I am come here; If I would have given way to an Aroitrary way, for to have all Lawes changed according to the power of the Sword, I needed not to have come hi∣ther; and therefore I tell you, and pray God it be not laid to your charge, That I am the Martyr of the People. After his Speech, he called for his Night ca. and putting it on, prepared himself to suffr that punishment his Enemies had Iudged him unto. The Sun shined that morning very clear without intermis∣sion, until the King came to the Ftai Block, and lay down, and then at that instant a Dark thick Cloud covered the face of the Sn, which for a time so constimeed, insomch, that a Gentle woman anding bre to behold this Dreadful Traedy; cred out, Look, look, Sir, the Sun is ashamed, and hideth his Face, as loathing to see this Florrid Mur∣der! immediately upon her words the atal Blow was given, such a one against Christian Religion, as all the Dvtis in Hell could not strike at once, so dreadfall a peruicious blow agin. This Bloddy stroke being struck upon the Royal Neck of the onely Protestant King in the World, it séemed rather to fall upon the Peo∣ple thn the King; for so soon as it fell upon his Neck, the People cry∣ed ot with so grievous and doleful a cry. as I nvec heard before; it raised a flood of teares, which sprng out of the Eyes of all that had Ears to hear and Hearts to understand the Treason, from the Noble to the Beggar; I observed that day, was a wéeping day; I searce saw a Shop of the thousands I beheld that day, wherein I saw not wéeping Eyes, with Hands wringing each other to express the anguish of their Hearts. The Presbyterian Congregations in the City of London for the most part assembled together; all, or the most part of the night before the
King was to suffer to pray for him, if it were the will of God to pray him out of trouble, however to prepare him for his sufferings, and to carry him through them with the comforts of the Holy Ghost: Never did King goe to Heaven in a greater Cloud of Prayers and Tears, then this King; and never was their greater mourning for the loss of any King then this: I think there was scarce a Protestant in the World, to whom the true Relation came, but shed tears for him; I have tal∣ked with Travellers who can tell more then this, how much the King was mourned for, especially when they saw his Book, which is Tran∣slated into all Languages almost, and sent into every Countrey. At this time there was a consultation held amongst the Grandees of the Sword-men, concerning a Massacre  the cheif Royalists and Pres∣byterians, both Noble, Gentrey, and Citizens, of the chief of whom they had a List, as also some in Prison: This was (as I was by se∣veral hands informed) carried in the Affirmative, until one (more politick then the rest) rose up, and told them. It was the ready way to have their own Throats cut; since now they had the Army at Lon∣don, and the Army divided into Levellers, and others, which Level∣lers were falling off more and more, and therefore this Blade, like A∣chitophel, gave Councel wisely, faying, That they had time enough to deal with them hereafter, without the running of so desperate a ha∣zard. This was the stopping of that Bloody Massacre and there was good ground for it; for Lilburn, Osburn, Overton, Prince, and Walwin, perceiving themselves cheated of their design, and that Cromwel called them in onely to keep them quiet, not to yield to any of their demands; and perceiving that Cromwels designs were to bring old England into the Spannish Mode, that is, to set up a Council of State to manage the Affairs of State, and an Inquisition, or High Court of Iustice, to Iudge in matters Criminal;  into what a Tyrannical road he was got, like open-hearted men did declare to the World, That the way was Tyrannical, and against the Liberty of the People, and did protest against Cromwel as a deceitful Seducer, and a subtil Hypocri∣tical Traytor. These Libellers (as they basly called them) did lie as a cross Bar in the Popish Factions way, which hinored from wedding the Blood of the Protestants, as they intended. However they shewed their intentions▪ for within a Moneth we had News from several parts of same Ministers that were shot for praying r the King, and Preaching for the Covenant.
Or, Calton, a Pious, Grae an arued Minister of London, was within a Main so after the King was out off, appreben  a Laytor, and yt into. Prison, for praimor tht God would rifore the late Kings Son to his Ist Right; after they had out off the Parter  King, they proded to t off the at Protestant Pas it of Europe a of peclaily those that had oposen it any  heretofore the Pop∣tion: They had three insure Mes of the Land old, Du Ha∣milton, the Earl of Holland, into the Lord Capel; these three who were sincere Protestants and protectes of the Driodot Government, and Lawes of the Kingdom these had their Heads chopped est in one was upon one Block Hamilton in Holland they owen a grut too . o∣ver since they broke the Poor desion, in making up the breach  the two Nationa in 1639 no being shite nents of procuri  Maent to the over thr King of the Posh Fction, About this time those of the Lower House,  Telves the Supreain Authority of the Nation,  as a Frée State, sent to the  of London  about a Rconciliation and Ae  betwixt, them  Th they would not take away the Church Reen a but father ∣grease them. The Mster of the  made this . That before they knew in what, and how far they would require them to comply with them, they would give no posi answer. At this thur Oerton, Prince, Wlvin, no Lilburn, who were of the Levelling party, were ca one a our of Cromwels actions since I had no lise of them before he called them waints and now he call them Divels, and Giddy headed Fellowe; what ur: they opely Declared against the present Poe, as llei, Tyranical, and coutrary to the Liberty of the People of England; for which they were I prisoned in the Tower, which much laged he  party, whereby Provideuce so ordeced it that they laid over to the World in Hele Printed beeks, the secret under hand Plotting of Cromwel and eron with the Popish Faction wai Popish Pirty, to prome them∣seives to the Crown.
