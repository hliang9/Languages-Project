CHARLES, By the Grace of GOD, King of Great Britain, France and Ireland, Defender of the Faith; To Our Lovits,  Messengers, Our Sheriffs in that part, conjunctly and severally specially constitute, Greeting. Forasmuch as We, by the thirty ninth Act of Our first Parliament, holden in the year, one thousand six hundred and sixty one, Intituled, Act for the Fishing, and erecting of Companies for promoving of the same; Have, upon consideration of the best and readiest means for improve∣ing the benefit and advantages which may redound by the Fishes which are or may be taken within the Seas, Channels, Firths and Lochs adjacent to, and surrounding this Our ancient Kingdom: Especially, that the said Trade will not only be a nursery for Sea-fairing men, a speedy occasion for building of Ships for Our and Our Subjects use both in Peace and War; But like∣wise, will set many poor and idle people a work, and furnish the materials of a great native export, for the continual enriching of Our said Kingdom, by a sure foundation of Trade and Commerce. For promoving and advancing of the which Trade of Fishing, We, with consent of Our Estates of Parliament, did creat and erect particular Companies of Our own free-born naturalized Inhabitants in this King∣dom, and of all others who should be taken and inrolled in any of the same Companies and Societies, and admitted to the Priviledges thereof within any Shire or Burgh within Our said Kingdom, betwixt and a certain day thereafter: And did constitute and creat such persons who should so enter themselves, and their Successors, in a Body Politick, to exerce the Trade after-specified; and did give and grant to them the Priviledges, Liberties, Freedoms and Immunities under-written, particularly and at length specified in the said Act of Parlia∣ment; which Act hath lyen over and taken no effect now these nine years by-gone. And We, being very desirous that the good and profit of this Our ancient Kingdom, designed by the said Act, should not be altogether frustrate, have been graciously pleased, for advance∣ing of the said Trade, to proffer a considerable sum to be payed out of Our Thesaury, and to enter into the said Society and Company; after whose Royal example, divers Noblemen, Gentlemen, Merchants and others, have since entred, and are content to enter into a Contract of co-partnery for making up of the said Society and Company, and have engaged to pay several sums of money, each of them for their own parts, for advancing of the said Fishing Trade, at the termes and in manner specified in the said Contract. And We being most willing to give all due encouragement to the said Society and Company, whereby they and their Successors may be constitute in a free Society and Company of Trade for the said Fishing; and withall considering, and being sufficiently informed, how prejudicial it will be to the said Trade to be erected in several Companies, by reason of the many discouragements and impediments which will daily arise and occur, through the competition and interfearing of several Companies driving one and the same Trade.
