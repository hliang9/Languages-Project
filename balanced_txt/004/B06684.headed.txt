THE Woman Outwitted: OR, THE Weaver's Wife cunningly catch'd in a Trap, by her Husband, who sold her for ten Pounds, and sent her to Virginny. To an excellent new Tune. NOt far from hence, there dwelt, an honest Man a Weaver, He had a Wife she was witty and fai, but her Wit it did deceive her; She was a Grain too light, she calls him Fool and Ninny; Which made the Man then often say, I'll go unto Virginny. Altho' he hard did work, he ne'er could live in quiet. She said her Cloathing was too base, so was her homely Diet; Tho' nothing she did want, as he could buy for Money, Which made the Man then often say, I'll go unto Virginny. She lov'd a lusty Lad, and vow'd she'd love him ever, At last her Husband found a Trick these loving Mates to sever: Yours notes, quoth he, I'll quickly change, that now so sweetly sing ye; Vnto a Merchant straight he went that sailed to Virginny: He coming then unto the Ship, Of Women you are lacking, And I have one that I can spare, and her I will send packing: The Times are very hard, I'll sell my Wife for Mony, She is good Merchandize you know, when you come to Virginny. If she be young, bring her on board, and I will entertain her; But tell to me the lowest price, for I must be some Gainer. Ten Pound he answered, I cannot bait one penny; She is good Merchandize you know when you come to Virginny. Then he came home unto his Wife, and said that he was packing; This joyful news reviv'd her mind, and set her Heart a leaping; And smiling to herself, she said, Then farewel Goodman Ninny, My Love with me shall merry be when you are at Virginny. One thing I do desire of thee, to see me, my Dear, take shipping. Ay, that I will, my Love, said she, and seem'd to fall a weeping; A bottle of Strong-waters good I will bestow upon thee, For fear that you should be Sea-sick a sailing to Virginny. Then come into the Ship, the Captain bid theem welcome, He led them into his Cabin, whereas such Guess came seldom: He stepped forth unto her Husband, and paid him down the Money, Who straight took Boat and row'd on shor and sent her unto Virginny. But when she saw that he was gone, and that she there was staid, She bitterly did wail and weep, and said she was betray'd, Take me, said she, with you, I'll never more offend thee, He cry'd, farewel sweet Wife, adieu, God send you to Virginny. Then presently they hoist up Sail, and had good Wind and Weather, And seven long weeks they were at Sea, before that they came thither; He for a Maiden sold her there, for fifty pounds in Money, And she another Husband had when she came to Virginny. They being parted thus, so many Leagues asunder, He carries Mony in his purse, there's none to keep him under, But governs all at home, and with his Friends lives merry; Now many one doth title him, a Merchant of Verginny.
