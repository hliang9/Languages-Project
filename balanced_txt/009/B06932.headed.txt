ily in Tears: LEGY,  ed Death of his Grace Duke of Glocester, llace at Windsor, on Tuesday the 30th.  ar of his Age. But tis our Sins, makes Fatal Stars Combine, To snap in sunder England's Royal Line; Our mighty Monarch, when this News he hea He will Lament, in sad and Brinish Tears; Such disl News ne're Touch Here needs no Daubing, Flattery to Paint, A Vicious Mortal for a very Saint; No Poets Art to praise him now he's gone, Who had so many Virtues of his own; His Youthful Heart rejoyc'd in Englands good, And though a Child, for our Just Rights he stood. Yet while we Sigh, what Fate will have, must be, No Power on Earth can alter Heaven's Decree; The Great, the Good, both Old and Young must Die, A Debt to Nature due, none can deny; No Heirs to Crowns, can be Exempt from Death, The Greatest Monarch, must resign his Breath. Here lies a Princely Body in the Dust, A Child in Years, yet Pious, Wise and Just; The hopes of England's Glory and Renown, Tho not on Earth in Heaven he wears a Crown.
