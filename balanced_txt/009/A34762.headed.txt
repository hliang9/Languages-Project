THE Countries Vindication, FROM The Aspersions of a late Scandalous Paper (Nick-named) Robert Tell truths Advice in choice of the next Parliament. In which his Popish Designs are fully discovered and de∣tected. By a Lover of his King and Country. Respice & Cave. BY how muh Designs are lid most opposite to Truth and Righteousness, to much the more are those workers of iniquity active and industrious to promote those indirect Interests, Per fas anefas, turn every stone, never wanting the presence of publick advantage. In this art of Legerdemain, our old, but now most vigorous enemies, the Papists, are upon their great trial of skill. In some Pamphlets they throw off the Plot, as visible as it is; and in a late Paper hey undertake to advise the People of England in their Ele∣cions of Parliament-men; and have made it their business to create Jealousies amongst the Prote∣stants, thereby to divide that Interest which is all little enough when intire, to resist their devilish and hell-bred Machinations. This Sophister tells us, There has been Factions in all Ages playing their tricks; and that in nomine Domini, I can consent with him to our sad experience, I can turn the truth upon the Popish faction, and by that time I have done, lay all the Devilish tricks at their own door. In the mean time tell him, Turpe est Doctori cum culpa redarguit ipsum: Thou that teachest another should not steal, dost thou murder, and commit Sacriledg? thou Hypocrite, take out the beam out of thy own eye first, before thou undertake the mote in thy brothers; and ere you hope to have your Advice to pass, let us examine your Composition. I find your whole Re∣ceipt has dangerous Ingredients, Reflections upon Parliaments, upon all godly sober men, and up∣on honest Country-men. Another part in the mixture, are seeds of Jealousies and Divisions thrown amongst us, your old stratagems! this will not do, Mors in olla, we find a Snake in the sweet herbs, and death in the pot; I believe you have had this recipe from Sir George Wakeman, skilful in the venomous Art of Poysoning. Your design, Sir, is discovered, therefore you cannot hope to succeed; your caution against the Godly, the sober party, nor the honest Country-man, will not divide us: I can assure you, Sir, they are no Papists; and for those unhappy divisions that are and have been amongst us in the Church, we shall demonstrate the Jesuit inforc'd 'em; and he must needs go that the Devil drives; and to draw a suspect one amongst another, he tells us of what tricks, and what vizards were worn in Forty-eight by Puritans and others; at which time you say they lost their Mask; a favour of your own bestowing, and now has reassumed it again, with which you are playing the Devil in the shape of an Angel of light; but what have you to do to rake up our former miseries, which I hope God has forgiven, and the King has graciously so long since pardon∣ed? by whose wisdom and goodness he sits Enthroned in his peoples hearts; all your subtilties can not unsettle the favourable apprehensions his Majesty has of his Protestant subjects loyalty after twenty years experience; nor any ways bring in question the duty and affections of his People; no, Sir, the resentments of former evils are too fresh amongst us for any Popish machinations to dissolve this union; take the holy cheat to your self your Piae fraudes are the best support of your Romish Church; and had not your Engins play'd amongst us, our Puritan had never separated from the Church of England; for I must tell you, all the sober, godly party, and Puritans too, were all conformable to the decent and orderly government of the Church of England; read and heard
Divine service, and wore the Surplice, and there held steddy till the fourth Commandment was almost expunged the Decalogue; witness the Book st out by the Arch-bishop of Canterbury, for licensing Sports, Pays, and Dancings on the Lords day, enforcing all Ministers to read it in their Churches, which divers otherwise conformable out of conscience refused, for which they were turned out of their Ministry, and a company of scandalous debauchees, men of any latitude, put into their places: This was a bird hatcht at Rome, sent to be nurst in England, knowing well it would bring to pass their infallible design to divide us; and from the same counsels came into our Churches those crouds of Trumperies, Tapers, and Crucifixes, Cringings and Bowings, that the Service of God was turned to a Popish Antick; all in pretence as it was publickly asserted by some Grandees then in the Church, to bring us to as near an union with the Church of Rome as possi∣bly the temper of the present time would bear. We do not forget what was enforc'd upon the peaceable Kirk of Scotland, where the three footed Stools from the old Womens Tayls began the War; all these were likely ways to preserve us from Popery, contrary to the designs of our blessed Reformers King Edward the sixth, and Queen Elizabeth of blessed Memory, who by degrees as those days would endure, drew us still further off from those Fopperies; and we might have ex∣pected then when the Nation was become generally Protestant, to have kept a greater distance by a further Reformation; and as in the Church, so in the State, men of corrupt minds, and pernici∣ous practices, to satisfie their avarice and boundless ambitions, obtruded several Illegal Impositions, as Loan-money and Ship-money, against Law, (for which divers Noblemen and Gentlemen endured long Imprisonments); Customs exacted without Act of Parliament, with swarms of Monoplies, under which the Nation groaned; then came in the Scotch with a formidable Army to our Borders, with their Petitions. A Parliament was call'd, who inspecting the Grievances of the Nation, dis∣covered those wicked Counsellors, and dangerous Influences of the Papists, Impeaching and call∣ing to account those contrivers and actors of these Oppressions; some whereof fled; others for their own protection, (and the Jesuits the better to shuffle in their designs in the midst of our con∣fusion,) made the best of Kings suspect his safety amongst his People, and drove us into that un∣natural War; then the Papist not out of affection to his Majesty, but having no other subterfuge, and to carry on their designs, ran in with their Arms, got into several great places of Trust, Mi∣litary and Civil; contriving and effecting an Act of Pacification with the bloody Irish Rebels, after they had imbrued their hands in the blood and murder of a Hundred thousand of his Majesties Protestant Subjects in Ireland; all which begat desperate apprehensions in the minds of most men, that Arbitrariness and Popery were breaking in upon us; though as we are bound to believe, never design'd by that blessed Prince and glorious Martyr. The Papist joyning unfortunately in this War, heightned the confusion, and now blood and rapine know no bounds, the King is over thrown in his just Cause by the wicked designs of these disturbers of the World, and enemies to Man∣kind, who brought him also to his miserable End; and it can, and is now prov'd, that the Jesuits had in that Trayterous and horrid murder a principal hand, Quis Talia fando sustinet a lachrimis. After this dismal Tragedy was over, and we in the height of distraction, and the Land in a Chaos of confusions, estrang'd from peace and settlement, God in Judgment remembred mercy, and by his Miraculous Providence, our blessed Prince, like the glorious Sun, after our dismal Nights, and sharp winter of afflictions, appeared in our Horizon, to our almost distracting-joys, receiving his People with open arms of Clemency, to which his People ecchoed with all loyal expressi∣ons of grateful affections and duty, our Government of Church and State establisht, and we now in the apprehensions of peace and safety, every man expecting to sit down under his own Vine and Fig-tree, enjoying the fruits of his labours, in which the Papist had more than an equal share, through the Grace and Princely bounty of our King (not suspecting their designs) and they boasting themselves as his most loyal subjects. Whilst they were in this unquestionable credit, and all the severe Laws against them laid asleep, infinite swarms of Jesuits, Priests and Friers, and all sorts of Orders, like the Egyptian Plague of Locusts, came in amongst us, perverting the Kings Subjects contrary to Law, com∣passing Sea and Land to gain Proselytes, in which they have prov'd too successful; and amongst those many hundreds seduced (to lay their foundations sure) they have rob'd our Nation of the most Heroick Victorious Prince, next Apparent Heir to the Crown. This we may remark as an infallible confirmation of their damnable Plot, a Treason of the deepest dye, never to be forgiven by any Protestant, and a quarrel never to be reconciled; they had wounded us in our several Members before, but in this they stabbed us to the very heart; and now it began to be fair day, their designs obvious, the ruin of King and Kingdom, with all the artifice that Hell could secretly and cunningly contrive; and had been as certainly executed, had not the infinite mercy of God taken care of us, unmaskt their designs and discovered their hor∣rid Plot, by the prudent, faithful, and unquestionable Informations of Dr. Oates, Mr. Bedlow, Dugdale and others, who under God preserved the Life of our most Gracious King, and with him our Lives, Liberties, Religion, and all that's dear to us; for which faithful im∣portant
service they deserve the best of Rewards here, and their Names to be written in Cha∣racters of Gold, Chronicled to posterity; and though their serious and most congruous Evi∣dences, back'd with many most undeniable Circumstances, have past an Examination by His Majesty and Council, and by two Parliaments successively; and lasty, by all the Judges of the Na∣tion, in fair, full, and Legal Tryals confirmed, and the Conspirators justly Convicted, and brought to punishment: yet such is the blinded wilfulness of many, and the malicious Impu∣dence of others, that notwithstanding all, and the Murder of brave Sir Edmundbury Godfrey to boot, they would fain wash their hands in Innocency, and are still playing their Game in new disguises, imposing a belief upon the world, that the danger lyes in the Dissenting Prote∣stants; but the Devil cannot detect them for one act of Disloyalty since His Majesties Restaura∣tion, whilest you have been plotting all this while, and wrought your designs into Treasonable Acts of all kinds; and yet by the help of your Principles, special Merits and Absolutions, as in∣nocent as the Child unborn. But, Sir, these fig-leaves will not cover your nakedness, you can∣not catch English-men in Cobwebs; nor can you, and all your Popish Masquerado's, dance in your Nets, but you must be seen, Noscitur ungue Leo, the Devil is known by his Cloven-foot, and your Characters are written in the flames of London, and in indelible Characters of Blood, which cry for judgment to Heaven against you: Take heed therefore, you that forget God, Christianity, and Morality, lest he tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver you: 'tis not the least happiness, that you are known to the world, you cursed Jesuits; What was your behaviour when you were banish'd Franc, when you were expell'd the Venetian Territories, and other States, where they found you Firebrands that would have destroyed their Kingdoms, and Com∣monwealths? Who Murder'd the French Kings? No Puritan, no Godly party, no honest Coun∣trey man. Phanatick Priests and Jesuits are principl'd for those Butcheries. You are too well known by the bloody Colours; and the Noble Cavalier that fought Conscienciously for his King, found such ill success with you in the late War, you robbing him of his Lawrel, and of the due Rewards of his blood and sweat, will never hand with you again: All your wheadles will never gn from the Church of England, nor make him insensible of the safety of his King, nor less car of the Interest of England by well-Elected Parliaments; neither shall all your false insinuations prevail to make the world believe, That either our Parliaments or People would put down Bishops, a Trick to put the design off your selves, that you may better, without suspicion, do the wor; no, Sir, we honour that Government, and by Gods Grace will stand to it, and re∣vere our Grave and Learned Bishops, whom we look at, under God, the best Bulwarks against your Tyrannies Popish Innovations. The next thing he brings out of his Box, is a new Shiboleth, or a distinction betwixt the honest Countrey-man and Courtier; and, indeed, there is a great difference, for the honest Countrey-man is for the honour, peace, and safety of the King and Kingdom; takes care, and labours hard to get money to support the King and Government; and this Courtier detested by all, and comes under the reproachful distinction, is a pernicious piece of Luxury, a Drone, a too-fac'd Janus, that has crept into the Confines of the Royal Palace, where he fawns and flatter, till he has ob∣tain'd so much countenance, as can get him into some Trust; and observing how the wind blows, turns his Sails so readily, that in time he dare attempt with Commendatory Letters, an Election in some petty Burrough, where he must drink away an honest Countrey Gentleman; and by the strength of a publick Purse he is chosen by those pitiful Sts, that understand no other danger or advantage, than the profit of the present Carowzing; he is now return'd and sits, having nei∣ther honour, honesty, nor estate, necessary qualifications for the trust of others Lives and Estates, his work is then to make up his stake by any device. I cannot compare it better than to the practice of some Knavish Master of a Ship, who being intrusted by his Owners with a goodly Ship, and fraught with a valuable Cargo; he having no part in either, takes up on Bottom R as much money as ever his credit can possibly stretch to; and having made up his Market, the next best opportunity, when he can most colourably do it, runs his Ship upon the Rock, or Shelves, where he may save himself, but undoes his Merchants and Owners. The Metaphor will hold as well with this Courtly Senator, who will serve the French King for Crowns, and sell his own Prince, whose bread and favour supported his being, and for a Pension, betray the Lives, Liber¦ties and Religion of the three Kingdoms, and is now known to the Kingdom by the name of Pensioner. 'Tis this Treacherous Crew of Court-Vermin we inveigh against, and that we cau∣tion against in all our Elections: but for all those men of Honour, Wisdom, and Integrity, that are faithful to His Majesty, and the Interest of the Kingdoms (attending the Court) we Love and Honour: Therefore cease your Calumnious Aspersions, and pack from amongst us. The quarrel now is purely betwixt Protestant and Papist: Since all must suffer together, of what perswasion soever, under the denomination of Protestant, I think it concerns all to stand together, and unanimously provide for our selves, by all lawful means: The chief of which, and the only remedy under God, is our Parliaments; who like good Physicians, purges away
corrupt humours, representing our grievances to the King, providing Remedies for all our di∣stempers, and supporting His Majesty against all foreign and homebred enemies. This, as it is the great priviledg and birth-right of English men, and is the bond of their safety, if the best of men be elected to that great trust; so if care be not taken to keep out Atheists, Papists, Pen∣sioners, and beggarly Prodigals, that will snap at every bait, your Mcine shall prove your Poyson, and your Physicians your fatal Executioners. Shut not there your eyes, nor stop your ears, you see and understand enough by what is laid open,  ll matter of fact; This design and devilish Plot has been long a gwing, and now  is labouring in its great Crisis; now is the time that all Hands, Hearts, P,  are all little enough to succour in this deplored calamity. Parliaments would  covered the Plot; offer remedies, and some think with too much hearty zeal. So that  Parliaments are al∣ready Dissolved, to the amazement of the Nation in this jctre  and 'tis hard and strange we cannot be thought well with Parliament, be they ; neither can we be without them; and these His Majesty graciously declares shall . Therefore Gentlemen, and my dear Countrey-men, in the Name of God, and as you value the concern of the Gospel, the honour, life and safety of your Prince, your Religion, Lives, Liberties and Estates, take care now of your Elections, as much, or more than ever; up and be doing, and the Lord that hath hitherto preserved you, will still deliver, if you be not want∣ing to your selves in the use of those lawful means God has put into your hands. I shall only add this necessary Advertisement, That if Parliaments be frequent, your danger will be so; for by often dissolutions of Parliaments, and your expction ot being answered, you may thereby be discouraged, grow negligent, and so let your wachul enemy have an opportunity to bring in their rotten Hirelings, that will sell your birthright, or any things, to answer their hungry appetites. The next danger is, lest frequent Parliaments, besides the trouble, will bring on a frequent insupportable charge, which those honest Gentlemen that deserve so great a trust, cannot un∣dergo the burden of, and so be forc'd to desert you. Therefore I humbly advise, and heartily beseech you, hear and pity the dying groans of your languishing Country; it is but your reasonable service, Nomo sibi nascitur partem patria, partem Parentes, partem Amici, all are concern'd. I address my self first to you the Electors, the Principal great Ingine, by which this mighty work must move; let no discouragements make you weary, but faithfully and duly attend your Elections, and actively strive to raise all your Friends, Acquaintance and Relations with you, and make your choice of men fearing God, and hating Covetousness; men of Honour, men of Honesty, and men of Estates, and then miss of a good Parliament if you can. Next, encourage those faithful Gentlemen, of whose fidelity you have already had experience; chuse them, and that freely, not charging them with a Penny, that they may be still in a capacity to serve you, without their ruine. And you most worthy Patri∣ots, that have immortalized your names by your faithful discharging of your Trusts in Parlia∣ment, let nothing discourage you, but stand to, and for your King and Country; be not weary of well doing, let not your hearts faint before you have fully wrought deliverance for the King∣dom; your merits can never be forgotten, for the memory of the just shall never fade. Give God his due, in maintaining his truths in our establisht Religion; give Caesar his right in his Royal Prerogative, and keep and maintain the peoples right, as a sacred relique deposited in your hands; and he that will break but one Link in this Golden-Chain, let him be Anathe∣ma, Maranatha: Lift up then your heads, brave English men, let nothing daunt you, mind well your Elections, and then Pope and Devil do thy worst, nothing but our own neglects and sins can undo us: and it will be the greatest shame, that we should be less active in so good a Cause to preserve our selves, than the Enemy in a wicked one, to destroy us. FINIS.
