A Faithful RELATION OF THE Most remarkable Transactions which have happened AT TANGJER; Since the Moors have lately made their Attacques upon the Forts and Fortifications of that Famous Garrison, LIKEWISE The Strength and good posture of Defence it remains now in. With an Account of the Trenches, Lines and works they have already drawn in order to their besieging several of the said Forts strongly Guarded by the English, and the advantagious success the English have obtained over those Infidels, in a late Fight between them; burning and demolishing their works, beating them out of their Trenches, killing them and pursuing them even to their Camp. ENglish Vallour has spread it self into the corners of the yet known World, so dread in Arms have Brittains Worthies ever been, that the amazed Earth has often trem∣bled at their prouess, whilest they have with small numbers made the now haughty Nations bow and yield unto their Conquest in tears of blood our Anger mourned, and felt our just revenge; then can we fear proud Affiks threats upon our famous Garri∣son well Mann'd? Or fearful Moors though ods of numbers press? whilst such brave Heroes, fraught with highproov'd En∣glish
Souls so nobly defend their charges against those barbarous Infidels, whose slaughtered Corps so oft hath strewed the neigh∣bouring Plains, in their several but unsuccesful Attempts, yet be∣ing obstinate end wilful in their own destruction, will take no warning, but by their frequent Attacks expose themselves as subjects to the English Vallour to whet upon, and thereby to shine more bright. But seeing at this time those barbarous Moors besiege that fa∣mous english Garrison of Tangier, the honour of our Nation, lying and maintaining its bounds and large dependances in Affrica with but a handful of Men in comparison, against the populous and powerful Nations that border upon its Territories, I shall give the Reader an impartial Account of most of the noated transactions that have happened there since the beginning of the now Siege. The Moors under the command of the Alcade of Alcasar their Captain-General, in their last years Assault upon our well-mann'd Forts being shamefully repulsed with great Slaughter as well as loss of Amunition and vast expence, killed in the very breach themselves had made, so lamentably as can be imagined, in the chance of War were forced to retreat in confu∣sion to the Town of Alcazar, and being pursued, many of them fled even unto Morocco, their chief City; of which shameful de∣feat, their King or Governour being advertised, sent for the Al∣cade in great wrath, charged him to regain the Reputation he had lost, by drawing up his Forces once more against this famous Gar∣rison of Tangiers. Upon which, a Body of about 8000 Men lay hovering about the Walls of Alcazar, till Orders were gi∣ven for their breaking the Ground, in order to which, about the middle of March last they began to draw a Line between the Town and Charles and Henrietta Forts, and there intrench∣ing a great number of Foot, and some Horse, had set their Pio∣neers to undermine the said Forts in order to the blowing them up, but the Cannon and small shot playing upon them from all sides, so furiously that they proceeded but very slowly in their Enterprize, many of them being dayly killed as they endeavour to widen their Trenches, and over and above, the Forts being well mann'd and Victualled sufficiently for six Months, in Charls Fort are about one hundred and fifty Men, commanded by Cap∣tain St. Johns, and Captain Trelawney; both persons of great Courage and resolution and Henrietta Fort against which they
bend their greatest Force, Lieutenant Wilson with about an hun∣dred men furnished with all manner of Ammunition for a brave defence, upon this latter Fort, about 5 or 6 hundred Moors were commanded to make an Attack, their main Body lying about half a League distance; they came on very resolutely and brought with them long pieces of Timber; which they placed against the Walls of the said Fort, and brought Fagots, Boards and other pieces of Wood to pile upon them, that so under the shelter of them they might undermine, and blow up the Wall of the said Henrietta Fort, which being perceived by the Lieutenant he gave order to ply them with Hand-Granadoes, the which was accor∣dingly put in Execution with great success, killing and wound∣ing several of them, whilest the great Guns from the other bo played upon them, and beat in their Works upon them, and di great Execution; yet sheltered by darkness, they all that night continued the Assault, but when morning appeared, they found the place too hot for them, and that their purpose would no take effect, nor force stand them in stead against English-Vall∣our, so leaving many dead upon the place they retreated in much confusion and disorder, our Cannon and small shot still playing upon them, that for haste they left all their combustible er behind them, to set which on Fire, Lieutenant Wilson caused to be let down five men in Ropes, who effected the same, and were drawn up again without any hurt or dammage, after the Moors were retired, Lieutenant Wilson to shew them how little he fear∣ed their force caused two Moors Heads to be cut off and fixing them upon Poles, and placed them publickly upon the Walls in the sight of the Moorish Camp, which all of that Nation hold for the greatest indignity that can be put upon them, because ac¦cording to their Mahometan superstition, they hold that when they die, their Bodies immediately are translated into aradice▪ but if they are dismembred, they can in no wise enter, so blinded are they by that preposterous Doctrine, but to our purpose, sin this Attack the Moors have again advanced their Lives, and as it is supposed recruited, they have drawn a Trench between Charles▪ Fort and the other part, and made their lines of Communicati∣on, yet our Men have made several Sallies, and done great Exe∣cution upon them, filling up some of their Trenches, and taking some Prisoners; they have of late brought a great number of Boards to cover their works, which are as 'tis supposed to shelter
them from the excessive heat of the Sun and do proceed with promise to themselves of better suc∣cess than formerly; but there being about four hundred Soldiers arrived from Ireland, this Garri∣son is in so good a posture of defence that we fear not what the assailants can do against us, besides we expect new Recruits from England, and having all Provision Plenty, it is conjectured that after they can no ways prevail, they will quit the Siege and retire as they have often done, and not expose their Lives to hazard upon such impossibilities, by rea∣son there is almost every week several English Men of War and Marchants lying in the Mould which will readily supply us with Men and Arms if occasion require, so that we are able to make a considerable Body of Men, and if the Portugals who first took the piece could maintain it with half the number we have now in Garrison against the Moorish Armies under the Command of their se∣veral Kings, then it is not to be feared through the assistance of the Almighty, but we shall as bravely defend it and atchieve as great if not greater ex∣ploits for the honour of our Country and the far fam'd name of true English Vallour. FINIS.
