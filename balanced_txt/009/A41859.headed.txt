Great and Bloody News FROM TANGIER, Or a full and True RELATION OF A Great and dreadful Fight Which happened on the 3d. of this Instant November Between the English and the Moors, And continued for the space of six hours, during which time 2000 of the Moors were slain, and several taken Prisoners, their whole Army consisting of 30000 put all to Flight, with the loss of six pieces of Cannon, and many Ensigns and Standards. With the Relation how they Cowardly Shot and mortally woun∣ded that Right worthy Gentleman, Sir Palmes Fairborne, as he was Riding without the Walls. As also of the brave Behaviour of the Spanish Horse, who took part with the English, and many other remarkable Passages, the like Victory not having been obtained these many years. STill in what place soever the English are resident, Victoria Crowns their Arms with good success, their Vallours are as dauntless as in their Native Land, when ever for the ho∣nour of their Prince and Countries Renown, Stern Mars does summon them into the Bloody Field, as has been seen in their
many Victories against such ods of Foes as Sunburnt Affrick has opposed against our famous Garrison of Tangier, which has so long defended it self against a Continent that has one part of the World for its large Portion. The Relation of the late dreadful Fight as we have it from very good hands, was as followerh, The Moors since the expira∣tion of the Truce, having with an Army of thirty thousand Horse and Foot advanced themselves, making many Lines of Incroach∣ment, Circumvaliation and Counacrvaluation, so that by degrees they had brought their main works within a Furlong of the Wall of the Town, and many of their advance Works were so near that with Hand-slings they could throw into the same and hit our Men as they stood upon the Fortifications, as likewise they had planted several great pieces of Cannon upon distant Batteries, which they began to play, which the ever worthy Gentleman Sir Palmes Fairborne Governour of the said Garrison perceiving, took a Party of Horse, and Rode without the Walls to observe more narrowly their Approach, but long he had not rode before he unfortunately received a Shot in his Body from one of the Enemies, who lay entrenched upon the Right, which Wound proved so mortal that he fell from his Horse and was carried in∣to the Town, to the great grief of all his Souldiers, but was alive when these Letters came away, the Spanish Horse seeing this, who were about 200 in number, mounted, and violently charg∣ed the Moors in the Front, beating them from their works, and were seconded by the English, consisting of about four thou∣sand Horse and Foot, under the Command of Collonel Sack∣ville, the Van being composed of the Spanish Horse, and the En∣glish Horse making a right Wing to the Main Body, the Sally being made on the third of November between eleven and twelve of the Clock at Night, as well hoping to surprze the Moors in their Trenches or Works, but that expectation failed, for the Sentinels upon the approach of the Garrison gave the Alarm to the whole Army, who came up very resolutely, but were as brave∣ly repulsed, for the Spanish Horse and our English Foot break∣ing into their Ranks, put them into great disorder, and made great Slaughter amongst their best men, so that our main Body pressing on with undanted Resolution. The Enemies were for∣ced to Abandon their Trenches, and fly to their Army for shel∣ter, many of them being killed in the flight. After two hours
Dispute the Moors Horse retired and left their Foot to Dispute it with our Horse and Foot, who though they were six times as many yet the Shot pressing on, and the Charge increasing on all sides, they began to shrink together, yet being encouraged by some Christian Runagadoes, they made some small resistance during which their disordered Horse had put themselves into a tollerable posture, and rallied, who being met and Charged by the English Horse, who were then advanced in the Front of the Battel, a number of them were killed upon the Place, and some taken Prisoners, so that the Fight continued very smart∣ly, for though many of the Moors were slain, yet they being so numerous still brought up fresh supplies to fill up the Gaps Death Made. Yet were they as often put to the worst, dis∣ordered, and at last totally routed. The Collonel himself, who all the time behaved himself Gallantly, and encouraged the English, he with several other brave Commanders, and about eight hundred Foot forced their main Body which was drawn up. and fronted with Musqueteers and Harquebussers, so that their Orders being again broken and many of their prime Commanders slain, they began to shew the small liking they had to continue the Battel. Several of them turning their backs, rushed through the Ranks of their own friends, and fled, disordering them in many places, which our Comman∣ders observing, took the advantage of their Confusion, and ere they could close the points of their Circle; killed a number of them, whilst this was doing in the Front, the Horse that served for our Right Wing, charged them so furiously in the Front, that they were forced there likewise to o∣pen their orders, which their General observing, came to the side in great hast, to stay his flying Souldiers, but could by no means do it, so that finding himself worsted on all sides, he gave order to sound a Retreat, where∣upon the English were so encouraged, that they pursued them with great Slaughter for the space of two Miles, but not thinking it convenient to venture any further for fear of an Ambuscade they returned, having taken 7 or 8 of their Ensigns, killed about 2000 of their Men, and taken about 30 Prisoners with 5 or 6 pieces of Canon, so that having cleared the Field and layed the Moors dead bodies up in several piles, they returned and filled up all their Trenches, and demolished their Votes, they returned Victorious in∣to the Town. There were in this Action about 10 or 12 of the Spaniards killed, and about 100 English, among whom we do not hear of any Officers of Note when they were come into the Town, for the better encouragement of the Souldiers, each who had taken an ensign received thirty pounds, and those who took the Prisoners, who were about 20 in number, had free leave to make the best of them, This action had caused a general Joy to the In∣habitants,
had it not been dashed with the unfortunate hurt of our Gover∣nour, not long after the Moors desired a Truce to bury their dead. which was granted upon the 8th of the same Instant, they having been Reinfor∣ced, made an other Attempt, but were as bravely repulsed with considerable Siaughter. The particulars of which, we shall shortly give you a faithful account of; farther, we have Letters that Informs us, the Earl of Plymouth by reason of his tedious Voyage at Sea, sell into some disposition which turned into a Feaver, of which he dyed, &c.
