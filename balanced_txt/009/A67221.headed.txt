A True DECLARATION concerning the surrender of BRIDGEVVATER. VVritten by Coll. EDMOND VVYNDHAM, To vindicate him from some false and scan∣dalous reports, raised by some mali∣cious Adversaries. Printed in the Yeare 1646.
IT is an old saying, that it is better to be fortunate then wise; I may truly adde in what concernes my selfe, with relation to the scandalls that are throwne upon me, by the practise and mallice of such as endevour to traduce my reputation, that it is better to be successefull then honest. For the one I am confident would have preser∣ved me in a fayre opinion and good esteeme a∣mongst all men, wheras the other only continues my credit with those that personally know me; and by that knowledge are confirmed in their beleefe of my integrity. I did beleeve that my owne innocency had beene a sufficient shield to guard and defend me from the malici∣ous reports of my enemies, whose rumors being false, and wanting the basis of truth, for their foundation, I imagined they would quickly vanish and not prejudice my honour; and therefore I contemned and despised them and their authors. But finding that these untrue sugge∣stions, although they have no colour of truth, by the slie and subtile insinuations of my adversaries, have gained credit with some noble personages, whose satisfaction I desire: and also to vindicate my owne reputation, lest silence should conclude my guilt, I have thought fit and am perswaded by some friends, to justifie my selfe by this true relation, under my owne hand of my behaviour in my command, which I shall maintaine with my life, against the scandalls and aspersions of all my adversaries. And I am the rather induced hereunto, because I have now nothing left me, but my reputation, which in the cause I have un∣dertaken cannot truely be blemisht. And I shall I hope by this Apolo∣gy, (although it be an inconvenience, that truth and honesty must be enforced thereunto, whilst treachery and falshood walke openly with∣out checke or controule) satisfie all ingenuous and honorably disposed persons, that it remaines yet spotlesse. For if I am guiltie of any crime, it cannot be lesse in betraying the trust reposed in me then trechery or
cowardice, or both, and I must justifie my selfe that I am guilty of neither, but if my accusers had beene more moderate, and had laid to my charge, folly, rashnesse, or indiscretion, I should have beene so modest as not to have justified all my actions: For I should have confess'd that souldiery was not originally my profession, and that I might be guilty of some such imperfections. But the scandall of trea∣son is of too venemous a nature to be digested; for it not onely destroys me, but dishonours my Familie, and staines my Posteritie. And there∣fore to wipe away this blemish, I haue put pen to paper, and doe heere deliver the impartiall truth of my proceedings, which if any man can contradict, I shall desire no favour in their forbearance. I know well that guilt is of the nature of filthy odours, who by stirring become more unsavoury, but vertue and integrity is of a contrary quality, which by sifting and searching becomes the more pure and refined; and there∣fore in confidence of my owne innocency, I doe publish this Declarati∣on, wherein I doe challenge all my enemies to detect me, if I be guilty of any miscariage of so high a nature as is laid to my charge, hoping hereby to make it appeare that I am free and cleere from those blacke calumnies and slanders, which malice, envy, and detraction have throwne upon me. I confesse that according to the dictates of my owne conscience and reason, and according unto the obligation I stood engaged unto his Ma∣jestie, as well by my common allegiance, as by my more perticular du∣ty of personall service, in the beginning of these unhappy differences and divisions of the Kingdome, I engaged my selfe on his Majesties party, wherein I have constantly persever'd either in acting or suffering untill this day; concurring with those of the contrary party, onely in hating detestable newtrality. According to my best ability I did di∣ligently execute all such Commissions as I did receive from his Ma∣jesty, and in the place of Governour of Bridgewater, did use my utmost endeavour to preserve that Towne, and to retaine the people in obedi∣ence to his Majestie. But I, like other of his Majesties Commanders, wanted the sinews of Warre, and was enjoyned a hard taske, to make bricke without strawe, to fortifie a Towne, victuall it, leavy men, pro∣vide
arms and ammunition, with all things necessary for the defence thereof, without money to effect it. I acknowledge I had an assigne∣ment of contribution, after long solicitation to a fit proportion to doe the worke; but this was presently anticipated by particular orders of my superiour Officers, and by free quarterings, so that very little mo∣ney could be gathered by my Collectors, but all or the most part was diverted into other chanells, especially of late for the maintenance of the new erected Garrisons of Lamport and Burrowe. And the Lord Gorings horse by their free quarter and trenchar money so impoverisht the Country, that for the space of six monthes before the surrender of Bridgewater, I am assured I did not receive three hundred pounds, I beleeve not two hundred pounds towards the payment of my Garison, and the furnishing of it with all things necessary for the defence there∣of. I did often complaine of my wants, both to the Princes Councell, and to the superiour Officers of his Majesties armies, so that my defects were apparently knowne unto them, yet could have no redresse, untill the Country was possest by the Parliaments forces, and then it was too late to make use of those unprofitable graunts, which were as diffi∣cultly obtained, as if they had beene for my proper benefit, and not for his Majesties use. And yet during those last 6 months, I had my men, ammunition, and victualls, which I had procured by my own expence and credit, commanded out of my Garrison, to supply the armie before Taunton, whilst it was under Sir R. Grenvil, and afterward under my Lord Goring, which was promised to be restored, but the performance came too slow. That the Towne lay conveniently to be fortified is most apparent, and that with expence it might have beene made very strong is most certain, but that it was so by the then made fortifications the contrary is manifest through want of meanes to effect the same. For almost halfe the Towne which is called Eastover, when Sir Thomas Fairefax came before it, had onely a dike cast without any fashioning or turfing of the workes, or forming of the flankers, so that although the Graffe were a good defence in the outside, yet the inside could hardly be made use of as a convenient brestworke. But that which was most to my prejudice, was, that such soul∣diers
as I had raised in that County by my interest, were alwayes com∣manded away out of my Garrison; so that when the enemy came be∣fore the town, I had not above two hundred and fifty of my old soul∣diers left in the town, besides townesmen, the rest were made up by Pembrokeshire men, taken by my Lord Gerrard in that County, and sent over to recruit Prince Ruperts Regiment after the battell of Naze∣by, and I had likewise some of Sir John Stawels regiment, and some few souldiers belonging unto Bristoll Garrison, which were newly come from Lamport. These came into the town not above three dayes before the enemie came before it, and the Pembroke-shire men were such, for the most part, as had formerly served the Parliament. They were in number about five hundred, and had the guard of that part of the towne, called Eastover, divided from the rest of the town by the river, and were appointed to defend two third parts of that line; the other third part being to be maintained by those of Sir John Stawells regiment, and those Bristoll souldiers which came from Lamport; so that there was in that part of the town about seven hundred souldiers, I having put more men into it then into the other part of the town, be∣cause the line was not perfected, and because Sir Thomas Fairfax with most of his horse and foot lay on that side of the town; Major Generall Massey keeping guards on the other side, where I had placed those of my own regiment, the townesmen, and some voluntiers. Most of these souldiers were upon the guard every night, doing constant duty twelve nights together, and my self was continually with them all that time, visiting one guard or other, all the night. Friday, the 11th of July, Sir Thomas Fairfax drew neer the town, and that night and Saturday placed severall guards within Musket shot of our works, and so continued without advancing further untill he stor∣med the town, which was Munday morning the 21. of July, between one and two of the clock, at which time he brought on two bridges to passe his men over the Graffe, which were so narrow, that I believe not above two men could passe over abrest, and one of these bridges sailed in the bringing on, so that if these Pembroke-shire men had been stout and honest, it being their guard that he attempted to force, it is apparent
how fruitlesse his attempt must have proved. I was then in Eastover, and as I conceived, did heare some noyse of the enemies preparation before they came on, and for the more certain discovery thereof, did send out twenty musketeers under the command of a Sergeant, being drawn out of Prince Ruperts regiment, who at their return, assured mee, that the enemy moved not, yet immediatly after that, the enemie came on, and marched with their bridge over Castlefield, where they had no shelter, from our shot, and if our men had not been false, they must needs have done great execution upon them; but these Pembrokeshire men, although they fired very well, did little or no execution on the enemy; for they either shot over their heads when they shot bullets, or else shot nothing but powder, as they themselves confessed after the town was surrendred, upbraiding divers Protestant Officers, calling them Papists, and asking them, whether they believed that they would fight against the Parliament to defend Papist Rogues? And yet I am assured, that there was not one Papist that was an Of∣ficer within the Garrison. At the same time that the enemy attempted Eastover, I hearing great vollies of shot from the other side of the Town, conceiving that the enemy might enter there, thinking this part secure, because it was so well man'd, having left a reserve of horse and foot on that side of the water, to be ready on all occasions to second those who guarded the line, and to prevent the enemies assaults, I rode with much haste round the line on the other side of the town to en∣courage the townesmen, and to observe if there were any danger of the enemies entring there; but before I could ride round the line, and return into Eastover again, the Pembrookshire men had laid down their arms, and when I came back, were helping the enemy over the works, and above fourty of them entred. Major Michel, who commanded in chief over that Regiment, being shot, was carried off, and I found no Officer there, the reserve of foot, and most of the horse being gone, on∣ly I espied at a distance, five or sixe horse, which were most of them Officers, amongst them were L. Col. Jones, and Cornet Welsh, whom I commanded to joyn with me, and to indeavour to beat out the enemy that was entred, which they did, and we forced back the enemy to the
top of the work, where wee could not charge them further, by reason of the steepnesse of the bancks, where the enemy defended themselves with pikes, and our own men mingled with the enemie, and fired upon us, and kill'd L. Col. Jones, being the next man unto me: I perceiving that it was impossible with horse to beat the enemy from that stand they made on the top of the works, wheeled about my horse, intending to ride to the other side of the line, to command from thence a party of Musketteers to force off the enemie; but when I came to crosse the street, I found that by the help of these treacherous villains, the draw∣bridge was broken down, and the enemies horse entred into Eastover, so that I found three were then so many of the enemies entred in∣to that part of the town, that it was impossible to beat them thence; whereupon I indeavoured in the best manner I could, to secure the re∣treat of as many souldiers as might be, out of Eastover, into the other part of the town, beyond the river; but my souldiers being in disorder, and confusion, the enemie coming on so fast, hindred divers that were endeavouring to get over the river, and some were slain, amongst which L. Col. Glanvile was one, who escaped from the enemie at the fight at Lamport, and came into the town, just as Sir Thomas Fairfax came be∣fore it. The enemie immediatly brought up their Cannon to force the drawbridge, which was the passage over the river, and by the shelter of the houses, came within Pistol-shot thereof, and before the chaines were fastened, made some shot through him, and killed and wounded some men, yet we secured the bridge; and notwithstanding all their Cannon-shot, which played continually upon us, we made two barro∣cadoes within the bridge, from whence I stird not, untill I saw those works perfected. The enemy that night had raised three other batteries, the one in Castle-field, the other in the way going towards Taun∣ton, and the third, at the end of West-street; these played most part of the day into the town, besides a Morter-piece, which they shot often out of Eastover. After wee had finished the works about the bridge, I having discovered where their Cannon lay, which battered us there, I caused the wreathed Gun to be brought down to that side of the town, and to be planted where I conceived it might most annoy the
enemie and beat them off from their Cannon, there being a Blind made and no other security for their Gunners, which succeeded accordingly; for hereby we not onely beate them from that Gun, but also with this peece we battered Master Harvies house and drove the enemie thence, which was a great safety unto us. The enemie and we lay now onely seperated by the river, they having houses and mudde walls on their side of the river, as usefull for the safety of their souldiers, as our works, houses, and mudde walls were unto us. Onely their walls had thatch of strawe for their coverings, which we fired, and so made them too warme for them, to make use of them that day. The river was forda∣ble at low water for horse and foot to passe over. I know not what ap∣prehension the enemie had, but that day about foure of the clocke in the afternoone, they seemed to quit Eastover in some disorder, and drew off their Guns from their battery in Castle Feild, and fired that part of the Towne they were possest off, whereupon we sallied, and seazed their Cannon wherewith they battered the drawe-bridge, and we tooke divers armes they had left behind them, and brought them into the Towne, but wanted conveniencie to draw off their Cannon, because we had barrowcadoed the bridge. But within a short time the enemie returned, and placed their guardes againe in Eastover. By this storme we had lost at least six hundred souldiers, all the Welsh being turned to serve the enemie except about forty, which were in the inner Townemost of Sir Iohn Stawells Regiment, and the Bristoll souldiers were taken prisoners, so that I had remaining about five hundred soul∣diers and towns-men, that bore armes, the rest being lost in the storme of Eastover, besides we lost two iron Guns, some ammunition and pro∣vision. Notwithstanding this losse I so encouraged those souldiers I had left, telling them that now the traytors were gone, we should be the more secure, having none but such as were faithfull remaining, and as we had fewer souldiers, so we had lesse ground to defend. That night we wrought very hard to lyne our thinne workes, and to raise Blinds to prevent the enemie out of Eastover, who might else in divers places command the inside of our Curtaines. The next morning being Tues∣day about the same houre that the enemie storm'd us, the day before,
they attempted us again, but with no successe, their souldiers not daring to assault our workes, but shouting very hard at distance, at length re∣treated without gaining any advantage, which was a great encourage∣ment to my souldiers, being now confident, that the enemie durst not attempt our workes, and that what they did the day before was by in∣telligence with the Pembroke-shire men. That afternoone about two of the clocke Sir Thomas Fairefax sent his third and last summons for the surrender of the Towne, to which I returned a positive refusall. Immediately after a house was fired to∣wards the west part of the Towne, and I going to give order for the quenching thereof, had not staid long but newes was brought that the Towne was fired in divers other places, and some boyes apprehended who were actors therein, confessing that they had been hired to doe it by some of the Pembroke-shire souldiers. A Livetenant likewise was taken endeavouring as was pretended to fire the Church, conceiving the Magazine had beene there: The boyes confession was a certaine proofe, but the evidence against the Livetenant was not so cleare. A house was likewise fired where the Gunners kept all their case and round shot, and such other ammunition as was prepared for our Ord∣nance, and likewise most of our match was there consumed, in short the fire grew so great and terrible that the Towne seemed all of one flame. Those houses that were fired neere the lyne, made the place too hot and dangerous for any souldiers to abide there: the townsmen all ran off their guards to secure their goods and houses, and drew off with them divers souldiers, by giving them money to assist them therein: So that the lynes were generally quitted, the Towne likely to be burnt all to ashes, the enemie ready to assault us, and few or none could be gotten to make defence, most of our provision and ammunition burnt and destroyed by the fire: And the most part of the souldiers and peo∣ple crying out to make conditions; whereupon I call'd a Councell of warre, and by the advice of all or far the greater part of the Officers that were there present, I bekeve I may truely say by all of them that were then there, it was thought fit to send unto Sir Thomas Fairfax for conditions, which with much importunity I was perswaded to doe,
after some of the cheife Officers and Souldiers of the Garrison had by the appointment of the Councell of warre viewed the Towne and re∣turned answer that it was not possible to be held. All that were then present can bear me witnesse, with what difficul∣ty I was perswaded to hearken unto conditions, and what industry I used to encourage the souldiers to defend it, but I have been since told by some of good credit, that there were others as solicitous to disswade them from it, being more studious to preserve their lives then their honours, telling the townesmen and the souldiers, that there was no reason, now that they might have conditions, that they should all sa∣crifice their lives, to satisfie the rashnesse of the Governour, who it may be, could not find means to reconcile himself to the Parliament; but for them, their offences were not so great, but that they might make satisfaction, which most of them have since done; and after their com∣ing unto London, were quickly released; by which perswasions, and other discouragements, especially that of the fire, the whole town be∣ing probable to be burnt down to the ground, and most of the am∣munition and provision being already consumed, there was a necessity of yeelding the town, and of accepting such Articles as the Generall would give us, he having intelligence of our condition, and understand∣ing it as well as our selves, both souldiers and inhabitants pressing mee thereunto, disserting their guards, and applying themselves wholly to exstinguish the fire, which now seemed to overspread the whole town. Whereupon it was agreed, that we should draw up Articles such as we intended to yeeld the town upon, and send them unto the Generall, which was accordingly done, and Mr. Ellyot sent with them, who immediately returned, with other Articles, subscribed by Sir Thomas Fairfax, which were such as afterward we were enforced to surrender the town upon; by which, both officers and souldiers became priso∣ners, to which I returned answer by Sir Jo. Hele, and Mr. Ellyot, that we would not accept those conditions, and that unlesse we might have our liberties, we were resolved to abide the greatest extremity, and
so gave order that the parley should breake off. And I endeavoured in the mean time, to draw men to the works, for the defence of the town; but whilest I was endevoring to draw men to the line, Mr. Ellyot returned with a positive deniall from the Generall, that he would give no other conditions; whereupon it was unanimously resolved by all the Officers and Gentlemen present, that we should accept those con∣ditions offered by Sir Thomas Fairfax. And I appeal unto all, who were at the meeting and transacting of the treaty, whether, when it was objected by such Officers and Commissioners as were present, that I should be held guilty of all the blood that should be afterwards spilt, if I accepted not the conditions; and whether they did not de∣mand what I would fight for, or what I would defend, for the town would be consumed unto ashes; and whether my answer were not, that I would fight for my liberty, or to have an honourable Sepulture in those ashes, but my perswasions could not prevail with them, for all unanimously prest me to the yeelding up of the town; this is the truth, which I will justifie, concerning the delivering up of the town of Bridgewater, wherein I will appeale to all who were there pre∣sent, whether I did ever absent my self out of apprehension of dan∣ger, or did not on all occasions shew my self ready to expresse my du∣ty and my loyalty with the hazard of my life. And whereas it hath been objected, that I sold the town, I defie all the world, to proue that ever I held any correspondence or intelli∣gence with the enemie, or ever received any favour or friendship from the Parliament, or their Armie; nay, I have been so tender in seeking to the Parliament for any of those things which they ordinarily afford to men in my condition, that I have forborn to sue for them, fearing, that those, who on no probable ground are so bold to scandall me, would easily be induced to misconstrue both our intentions, and interpret civi∣lities disguised corruptions. I confesse, after the surrender of the town, I was civilly treated by the Generall, and some of his Officers, and out of that civility, I am confident they will vindicate mee from all these
aspersions, if they be required thereunto. I lost all I had in the town, which in goods and housholdstuffe, I am sure was of a considerable value, not preserving so much as mine, my wifes, or childrens clothes, which indeed were allowed us by the Generall, but after taken away by the Committee; and for ready money, the Generall allowed me to carry out thirty pounds, but truly I had not ten pounds when I left the town, but was enforced to borrow money to bring me to London, for I spent not only what I had allowed from his Majesty, but mine own revenue was imployed in that service, as those who kept my ac∣compts can cleerely justifie, besides what I borrowed and ingaged my self, to satisfie for the publike service. There was never any rationall man that was corrupt, but it was for some end or advantage, I am sure I could have none in it, for I lost all that I had in the world, not preserving a peniworth of any goods; nor had I any conditions for my other estate, which hath been ever since in sequestration. This justification I offer to the view of the world, and do challenge all my adversaries to produce but a single circumstance to make their scandalls probable, which if they shall offer any, I shall not doubt, but by the testimony of persons of honour, cleerly to convince their malice. All that I shall hereby desire, is, that having in this adventure lost all my estate, I may by the candor of those that reade it, be preserved in my reputation, and then, although few begreater sufferers then my self, yet none shall be more contented, because in the whole progresse of this businesse, I did nothing with relation to the trust reposed in me, that awakens my conscience to repentance. FINIS.
