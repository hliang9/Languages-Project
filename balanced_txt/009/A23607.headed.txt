Great News from Dublin, iving a True Account of the Seizing of a Ship coming from IRELAND, with Fifty Commissions from the late King James, to several Gentle∣men in Lancashire, in order (as suppos'd) to a Rebellion in ENGLAND. Together, with the Relation of the Papists Seizing the Protestants Estates in Ireland, and imprisoning the Vice-Provost of the Colledge of Dublin, and other Worthy Divines, on pretence of a PLOT, &c. With Allowance. Chester the 12th of June, 1689.SIR, ON the Eleventh of this Instant, Arrived here a Vessel, with some Fugitive Protestants Aboad, which give an Account, that the pretended Parliament of Dublin, after the general Concurrence of both Houses, for rescinding and abolishing the late Act of Settlement, proceeded to pass a Bill for the For∣feiture of all Estates of Protestants absent; which, with all Severity, even e Soldiers and Rabble-Papists put in Execution: That upon the Report of Supplies eing Landed at London-Derry, they immediately Issued out an Order for securing all Pro∣testants of any Note; and particularly, they have clapt up the Reverend Doctor Action, Vice∣rovost of the Coledg, and Doctor King the Minister of St. Warbourgh's Parish, and seve∣l others, upon a Blind pretence, that they were Plotting against the Government, (as ey stile it) though all that could be said for harmless and Innocent Persons, was urg'd  their behalf to the late King; but such is the Insolence and Jealousie of the French Minister, and his Party, That it is now thought no longer in his Power to deny or main∣in any thing against them. Yesterday came in a Vessel from Dublin to this Port, in com∣ny of another small Vessel, and King William's Officers of his Customs going on Board her, emember'd the Master had about five Weeks before stole out of the Harbour, without king her Entry at the Custom-House, and the Master besides being suspected for an ill Man they gave notice to the Mayor, and other the Kings Officers, who immediately Re∣t and Seize on the Kings Vessels; and, after strict Search, find packt up Fifty Commis∣, directed to several persons in Lancashire; which Commissions were forthwith sent to  Majesty, and 'tis hoped, will give an ample Discovery of all or most of the disaffected sons in that County: Colonel Kirk, with the Ships and Soldiers under his Command, 'd from the Isle of Man the fifth Instant, the Wind at East South-East, a pretty strong le, so that we doubt not, by this time, of his safe Arrival: From Dublin we hear, that the ist Army is extreamly discouraged with the vigorous Resistance of the Protestants in London-Derry, that they begin to look nearer into Matters, and do already shake their ads, and wish they could handsomely unravel their past Actions. Doctor Walker, and eutenant Baker, do labour indefatigably for the support of the Town, which stands m yet, and in good condition; though by continual Watchings, and hard Service, they o hourly wish and Sigh for their long expected Succours. The Lord Tyrconnel continues et indisposed with the Black Jaundice, which had like to have prov'd dangerous to him; e seems to be sensibly afflicted for the loss of his reputed Son the Lord Galmoy, (who was ill'd before London-Derry in the last great Sally) and is not well satisfied with the French anagement of Affairs: Many of the Irish Army desert daily, and take the Boggs for eir Refuge, being either terrified with the haughty Insolence of their French Comman∣rs, or tired with the continual drudgery of Marching, Counter-Marching, and other teigues of Martial Exercise and Dangers: We have it confirm'd, that great Num∣bers of Boats and other small Vessels, design'd (as is thought) for Transportation of Sol∣ers from any part of the North of Ireland to Scotland, have been seized and burnt by he Ships from Scotland. The Protestants of Dublin begin now to be very apprehensive  their Safety, especially since the Confinement of those Clergy men and Encroachments  the Colledge: The late King hath put a stop to all Passes; and such is the strictness and severity of the Searchers, that we are likely to have little or no Intelligence from Dublin. This is all that occurs at present From your Humble Servant, J. M. LONDON. Printed for W. Downing 168
