BY THE KING. TRustie and welbeloved, We greet you well. Hauing obserued in the Presidents and customes of former times, That the Kings and Queenes of this our Realme vpon extraordinary occasions haue vsed either to resort to those contributions which arise from the generality of subjects, or to the private helpes of some well-affected in particular by way of loane; In the former of which courses as We haue no doubt of the loue and affection of Our people when they shall againe assemble in Parliament, so for the present We are enforced to proceede in the latter course for supply of some portions of Treasure for divers publique services, which without manifold inconveniences to Vs and Our Kingdomes, cannot be deferred: And therefore this being the first time that We haue required any thing in this kind, We doubt not but that We shall receiue such a testimony of good affection from you (amongst other of Our subjects) and that with such alacrity and readines as may make the same so much the more acceptable, especially seeing We require but that of some, which few men would deny a friend, and haue a minde resolved to expose all Our earthly fortune for preâˆ£servation of the generall; The summe which We require of you by vertue of these presents is  which We doe promise in the name of Vs, our Heires and Successours to repay to you or your Assignes within eighteene moneths after the payment thereof vnto the Collector. The person that We haue appointed to collect, is  to whose hands we doe require you to send it within twelue dayes after you haue receiued this Privy Seale, which together with the Collectors acquittance, shalbe sufficient warrant vnto the Officers of Our Receipt for the repayment thereof at the time limited. Giuen vnder our Privy Seale at  the  day of  in the first yeare of our raigne of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland. 1626.
