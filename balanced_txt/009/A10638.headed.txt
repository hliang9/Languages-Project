The serpent answerd I maye doo it good / to fore al the world that I doo / the nede of hongte may cause a man to breke his oth / The man saide yf it may be not bettre / gyue me so longe respyte tyl we mete and fynde that may Iuge the mater by right / The serpente graunted therto / thus they wente to gydre so longe that they fonde tyselyn the rauen / And slyndpere his sone / there reher∣sed they theyr resons / Tiselyn the rauen Iuged anon that he shold ete the man / he wolde fayn haue eten his parte and his sone also / The serpent said to the man how is it now / what thynke ye haue I not wonne / The man saide / how sholde a robber Iuge this he shold haue a uayle therby / & also he is allone / ther muste be two or thre atte leste to gydre and that they vnderstande the right & lawe and that don / late the sentence gon / I am neue∣theles yl on ynough / They a greed and wente forth bo∣the to gydre so longe that they fonde the beer & the wulf to whom they tolde theyr mater / And they anon Iuged that the serpent shold sle the man / For the nede of hon∣gre breketh oth alway / the man thenne was in grete doubte & fere / and the serpent cam and cast his venym at hym / but the man lepe a way from hym with grete pa∣yne / And said ye doo grete wronge that ye thus lye in a wayte to slee me / ye haue no right therto / The serpent sayde / Is it not ynough yet / hit hath ben twyes Iuged / ye sa∣yd the man that is of them that ben wonde to murdr and robbe / Alle that euer they swere and promyse thy holde not / but I appele this mater in to the court to fore our lord the kyng / And that thou mayst not forsake /
And what Iugement that shal be gyuen there / I shal obeye and suffre / and neuer doo the contrarye. tHe bere and the wulf sayden that it sbold be so / And that the serpent desired no better / They sup¦posed yf it shold come to fore yow / It shold goo there as they wolde. I trowe ye be wel remembrid herof· Tho cam they alle to the court to fore yow / And the wulues two chyldren cam with theyr fader. Whiche were callyd empty bely and neuer full / by cause they wold ete of the man. ffor they howlyd for grete hongre wherfore ye commaunded them to auoyde your court / The man stode in grete drede / And called vpon your good grace and tolde how the serpente wolde haue taken his lyf from hym to whom he had sauyd his lyf and that aboue his oth & promyse he wold haue deuoured hym / The serpente an∣swerd I haue not trespaced / And that I reporte me ho∣olly vn the kyng / For I dyde it to saue my lyf / ffor ne∣de of lyf / one may breke his oth and promyse / My lord that tyme were ye and alle your counseyl here wyth a∣combryd For your noble grace sawe the grete sorow of the man / And ye wold not that the man shold for his gentilnes and kyndenes be Iuged to deth / And on that other sith hongre and nede to saue the lyf seketh narowly to be holpen / hier was none in al the court that coude ne knewe the right hierof / Ther were somme that wolde fayn the man had be holpen / I see them hier ston∣dyng / I wote wel they sayde that they coude not ende this mater / Thenne commanded ye that reynard my neuew
shold come and saye his aduy in this mater / that tym was he aboue alle other byleuyd and herd in the court / And ye bad hym gyue sentence acordyng to the best right / and we alle shal folowe hym / For he knewe the grounde of the lawe / reynard said my lord / it is not possyble te yeue a trewe sentence after theyr wordes / for in here sayeng ben ofte lesynges / But and yf I myght see the serpent in the same paryl and nede that he was in whan the man loosed hym and vnbonde / Thenne wyse I wel what I shold saye / And who that wolde doo otherwise he shold mysdoo agayn right / Thenne sayd ye my lord reynard that is wel said we alle· corde herto / ffor noman can saye better / Thenne wente the man and the serpent in to the place wher as he fonde the serpente Reynart bad that the serpent shold be sette in the snare in lyke wyse as he was / And it was don / Thenne sayd ye my lord / reynart how thynketh yow now / what Iuge¦ment shal we gyue. Thenne said reynart the fe. My lord now ben they bothe lyke as they were to ▪ they haue neyther wonne ne loste See my lord how I Iuge for a right also ferre as it shal plese your noble grace▪ yf the man wil now lose and vnbynde the serpent vpon the promyse and oth. that he to fore made to hym, he may wel doo it. But yf he thynke that he for ony thyng shold be emcombryd or hyndred by the serpent. or for nede of hongre wold breke his oth and promyse. Thenne Iuge I that the man may goo frely where he wyl. and late the serpēte abyde stylle boūden. lyke as he myght haue don at the begynnyng. fforhe wold have broken his oth and
promyse / where as he helpe hym out of suche fereful peryl / Thus thynketh me a ryghtful Iugement that the man shal haue his fre choys / lyke as he to fore hadde. lO my lord this Iugement thougt yow good / and alle your counseyl whiche at that tyme were by you / and folewed the same / And preysed reynardis wysedom that he had made the man quyte and free / Thus the foxe wysely kepte your noble honour and worship / as a triewe seruaunt is bounde to doo to his lord / wher hath the beer or the wulf don euer to yow so moche worship They conne wel huylen and blasen stele and robbe / and ete fatte morfellis and fylle theyr belyes / And thenne Iuge they for right and lawe that smale theuis that ste¦le hennys and chekyns shold be hanged / But they hem¦self that stelen kyen oxen and horses / they shal goo quyte and be lordes / And seme as though they were wyser than salamon / Auycene or aristotiles / And eche wil be olden hye proud / and preised of grete dedes and hardy But and they come where as it is to doo / they ben the firste that flee / Thenne muste the symple goo forth to fore / And they kepe the rereward behynde / Och my lorde these and other lyke to them be not wyse / but they destro∣ye towne. castel. lande and peple.

And I wold euer myssake hym / and wold euer hyndre hym to my power / Reynart the foxe thanked the kynge with fayr curtoys wordes / And sayd / dere lorde I am not worthy to haue the wrship that ye doo to me / I shal thyn¦ke theron & be trewe to you also longe as I lyue / & shal gyue you as holsom counseyl as shal be expedient to your good grace / here wyth he departed wyth his frendes fro the kynge / Now herke how Isegrym the wulf dyde / bruyn the bere / thybert the catte / and erswynde & her chyldren wyth their lignage drewen the wulf out of the felde / and leyde hym vpon a lyter of heye / & couerd hym warm / and loked to his woundes whiche were wel .xxv· and ther cam wyse maistres and surgyens Whiche bonde them & weshe hem he was so seke & feble / that he had lost his felynge / But they rubbed & wryued hym vnder his temples & yen / that he sprange out of his swoun̄ / and cryde so lowde that alle they were aferde / they had wende that he had ben wood bvt the maistres gaf hym a drynke / that comforted his herte and made hym to slepe / They comforted his wyf / And tolde to her that ther was no deth wounde ne paryl of his lyf / Thenne the court brake vp / and the beestis departed and wente to theyr places and homes that they cam froo.
