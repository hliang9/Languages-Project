To the Jngenious peruser desirous to Learn the Most, vsefull, Accomplishment of Short-Writeing Since the Decease of my quondam Master Mr Ieremiah Rich J haue taken noe small pains to Reduce his Jncomparable art into a more easy and Expeditious method soe that the meanest Capacitys may learn it in a uery short space bestowing but one howers Time in a day provided they will but heedfolly observe the Rules that are set before them and proceed orderly, Learnig one Rule throughly first, before they goe to the next, which they may well afford to doe, since the whole is Contrived with soe much plainenesse and Brevity, as might neither Clogg ye memory nor put the Vnderstanding upon the Racke, it was not first attempted with any thoughts of comeing to publique Veiw, But seeing that severall have highly pretended and Endeavoured to Bring it to something Extraordinary wherein yet their pains hath hetherto∣in my apprehension failed of that successe which the world expected I, have therefore for the Authors sake and the Reguard I beare to his mem∣ory and Excellent Art ventured this small peice to seeke its fortune amo∣ngst the rest in which I have wholly built vpon his Foundation not endeavouring to overthrowe his Ingenious structure, but only add thereunto more Beauty and ornament, and though very many Considerable Improve∣ments have been made, as the Iudicious will soon discerne yet I have soe Designed it, that the New Testament and Psalmes which are printed in Mr Richs Caracter, may bee read perfectly by those that shall Learn only this, and such as haue Learnd another method already may yet find much help from this for their further Improvement both as to exact Reading and ready — writeing, and therefore desiring the Ingenious practitioner to accept of my Good will heerein I rest An unfaigned Lover of Art Nathaniell Stringer To his Jngenious Freind M, Nathaniell, Stringer on his Vsefull Work Jn Jmproveing Mr Richs Short-Hand, Jntituled, RICH REDIVIVUS Vanish dull Scriblers with your Long Short-Hands Or Scrawl on still what noe man understands Your tedious methods soe perplext and darke They are out-run by every Limping Clarke.
