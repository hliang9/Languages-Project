Repentance of it unto his BrotherMat. 5.23, 24. who is then to forgive imLuk. 17 4 but if the Offendor neglect to doest the Brother offended is to goe, and admonish and con∣vince him of it, betweene themselves privately: If there∣upon the Offendor be brought to Repent of his offence the Admonisher hath won his Brother But if the Of∣fender heare not his Brother, the Brother offended is to take with him one or two more that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established, whether the word of Admonition, if the Offendor re∣ceive it, or the word of complaint to the Church if hee refuse it, the offended Brother is to tell the Church, if he refuse to heare the Church, then is he to bee accounted as an Heathen, and PublicanLuk. 17.3 Math. 18.15.16, 17. Quest. What if the Scandalls or Offences bee pub∣lick, how are they to be removed? Ans. By publick Reproofe1 Tim. 5.20 Gal. 2.14. and if the offences be not onely publick but haynous, then the Church is to remove the offence, by Excomunicating the Offendor out of the Church1 Cor. 5.15 1 Tim. 1.20. Quest. How is Excomunication to be administred? Ans. When the offence of any Brother is publick, and haynous, or being private is through the Offendors ob∣stinacy become publickly scandalous; the Church being met together, is in the Name and Power of the Lord Iesus, and with his Spirit, are to deliver such an one to Sathan for the destruction of the Flesh, and the Sal∣vation of his Soule, in the day of the Lord Jesus1 Cor 5.1.4. 5, 11, 12. 2 Thes. 3.14. Mat. 18.17. Quest. Is there no use of Suspension in the Church? Ans. Not as a Church Censure or as an Act of power, but as an Act of discretion in the Church Officers, dis∣cerning the uncleane from the cleane, untill they bee cleansedLev. 10.10 Quest. What is Anathama Maranatha? Ans. It is the utmost Censure of the Church, whereby a Brother falling from the love of Christ, into hatied a∣gainst him, is cut off from fellowship with Christ, for
ever even to the comming of the Lord1 Cor. 16.22. Quest. Having seene what power of Government the Church hath received, and exerciseth within it selfe. Tell me now whither one Church hath power of Go∣vernment over another? Ans. No Church hath power of Government over another, but each of them hath chiefe power within it selfe, and all of them equall power one with another, e∣very Church hath received alike the power of binding and loosing, opening and shutting the Kingdome of HeavenMat 18.17, 18. but one to another all of them are Sisters;Cant. 8.8. all of them Sarahs, all of them Queenes, none Hagar, none of them ConcubinesGal. 4.26. Cant. 6.8. but by their owne corruption or usurpation of othersRev 18.17. Finally, all of them, are Candlesticks of the same precious met∣tell, and in the middest of them all Christ equally walkethRev. 1.12, 13. Quest. But if one Church have no power of Govern∣ment over another, what course is there left to Reforme such corruptions, as may arise in any Church, whether in Doctrine or practise. Ans. The corruptions that are found in any Church, doe either infect part of the Church, or the whole body; if part onely, then the part remaining sound may either convince and reforme their Brethren themselves if they be able, or if they be not able they may at least prevaile so farre with them, as to send for light to some other Church, as they of Antioch did to the Church at Jeru∣salem. But if the Corruptions found in a Church doe infect the whole Body, yet still there is hope in Israel concerning this, for though one Church have not power of Government over another, subordinate to them, yet every Church hath equall power one with another, as coordinate with them: And therefore looke what po∣wer one Brother hath over another in the same Church, the same power hath one Church over another in Bro∣therly communion; as if one Church shall heare of any
offence in another, they may enquire the certainty of it, and thereupon send Letters and Messengers to convince and admonish them of it. If the Church offending doe heare the Church admonishing, they have gained their Brethren, and their owne desire: If the Church heare them not, then the Church may take one or two Chur∣ches more to assist them, in the conviction of that sin: if yet the Church heare them not, then (upon due notice given) all the Churches thereabouts may meete toge∣ther, and after judicious inquiry into the Cause, may by the Word of God confute and condemne such Errours, in Doctrine or practice, as are found oftensive: to pre∣vent the spreading, either of the Gangreene of Heresie, or of the Leprosie of sin, and if the Church offending shall not yet hearken to their Brethren, though the rest of the Churches have no power to deliver them to Sa∣than, yet they have power to withdraw from them, the right hand of Fellowship, and no longer to hold them in the Communion of Saints, till they approve their Repentance.By pro∣portion, from Mat. 18, 15.16, 17. 2 Thes. 3.6. FINIS.
