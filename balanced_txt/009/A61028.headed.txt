A SPEECH MADE BY A Member of the Convention of the States IN SCOTLAND. WE are now called together by his High∣ness the Prince of Orange, to Consult and Deliberate, what Methods will be most proper to secure Our Religion, Laws and Liberties, in order to which, the first thing that will fall under our Consideration, is the setling the Sovereign Power. I take for granted, that you are fully convinced, that King James the 7th, by his many Violations of the Fundamental Laws, by his endeavouring to esta∣blish a Despotick and Arbitrary Power, and intro∣duce Popery, (tho he himself had confirmed all the Laws that were enacted in Favour of the Protestant Religion,) has thereby subverted the Constitution, and (that our Miseries might have no Redress from him) has left us in a time, when we needed his Pro∣tection most. The Eyes of all Europe are upon us, and it is in our Power to make our Selves, and our Posterity, either Happy or Miserable, by making a choice either to call back the same King James, and hazard once more all that Men account Dear, to his Mercy; or to settle the Government on some other, under whom we may live Quiet and Peaceable Lives, without the perpetual Terror of being swallowed up by Popery and Arbitrary Government, which all good Men hoped were now banished, and yet be∣hold a new Off-spring is sprung up, which plead eagerly for both, tho under the mistaken Names of Duty and Allegiance: It's strange that any Man can so far Degenerate, as to prefer Slavery to Liberty, and that they should be so much in Love with Chains, that when they were fairly shaken off, they should run furiously to be Fettered again; as if the Otto∣man and French Government were so charming in our Country, that we cannot live without it, tho we have so lately groaned under the dismal Bur∣den of it: And it might have been supposed that even these, who had been Instrumental in Enslaving their Fellow Brethren, and were grown Fat with Sucking the Nations Blood, would have taken ano∣ther Method to Reconcile themselves, than by per∣suading us to purchase their Safety, at so vast an Ex∣pence as the Ruin of more than three Parts of the Nation will necessarily amount to. If we do but a little Reflect on the Motives which these Men (blinded by Self-interest) make use of, to Delude the Nation into a Security that wanted very little of proving Fatal to it, and compare them with the strong Reasons, we have to disswade us from being so imposed on, they will be found so Weak and Impertinent, that we must Judg it next to Impos∣sibility, to suffer our selves to be twice Deceived. But if the Experience of our former Miseries, so lately hanging over our heads, (the very thoughts of renewing which, make all good Men to trem∣ble) has not made us Wiser, and be not of Efficacy enough, to deter us from venturing another Ship∣wrack, and exposing all again to the Discretion of Roman Catholicks: It's more than probable that GOD has abandoned us, and given us up to be∣lieve strong Delusions. First, They will endeavour to perswade us, that Kings are Eximed from Punishments here on Earth, and nothing they do, can be Quarrelled by their Subjects, which indeed might with some Reason be urged among the Turks, who reserve nothing from the Power of their Sultans, and where it's Death to Dispute his Commands, tho never so Arbitrary and Tyrrannical: But with what Impudence can such Stuff be imposed on us, who never admit our Kings to the Government, till they Swear to Rule us ac∣cording to Law, and no other ways? The Laws are the only Security we have for our Lives and Pro∣perties, which if our Sovereign subvert, Subjects cannot be blamed, for making use of the ordinary means to preserve them, and since that cannot be done without withdrawing Obedience from such a Magistrate as goes about to destroy them, such an Act cannot properly be said to punish him, (because we take nothing from him to which he has a just Claim, but do only shun the occasion of making our selves miserable. The Speculative Doctrine of Pas∣sive Obedience, has done too much mischief among us, and what has befallen the King may be justy im∣puted to it, for the believing that without Opposi∣tion he might do what he pleased, encouraged him to take such measures as have drawn all these mis∣fortunes on him. Secondly, Others are so Fond as to believe, that we may be Secure in calling the King back, provi∣ded they so Limit him, that it will not be in his power to hurt us. These men do not consider, how small a Complement this is to a man of the Kings Temper, from an Absolute Prince, as he was pleased to fancy himself, to content himself with the bare Title of a King; and how insupportable the Change must be, if from being Master of all, he must force himself to comply with a thousand Masters, and see his Throne become his Prison. But how airy is it to fancy, that any Restrictions of our Contrivance can bind the King? For 1st, It's most certain they can never be Voluntary, and what is constrained and done by Force, is by Law declared to be Void and Null; to whose Assistance the Popes Dispensing Power being joined, would quickly blow off these Sampson Cords, and the Royal Power would again re∣vive with all its Vigour and Lustre.
Thirdly, The King is of a Religion that has in a famous Council decreed, That no Faith is to be kept with H reticks, much less with Subjects whom he looks upon as so many Rebels, and will not miss to treat them as such, whenever they give him the Op∣portunity of doing it; for his greatest Admirers do not run to that height of Idolatry, to imagine him so much Angel, as not to take all methods to revenge so great an Affront, and secure himself at our Cost from such a Treatment for the future; the appre∣hensions of which resentment will strike such terror in mens minds, that nothing will be capable to di∣vert them from offering up All for an Atonement, and Popery and Slavery will be thought a good Bar∣gain, if they can but save their Lives. Then we may lament our Miseries, but it will not be in our power to help them; for a Prince of Orange is not always ready to rescue us, with such vast Expence and so great hazard to his Person; and if our Madness hurry us so far, we deserve rather his pity than his resentment. Fourthly, What Arguments has the King given since he left us, to persuade us he will be more faith∣ful in observing his Words and Oaths, than hitherto he has been? Does he not in a Letter lately printed here, expresly say he has ruled so, as to give no oc∣casion of complaint to any of his Subjects? Is not the same Letter signed by one who sacrificed both Conscience and Honour to Interest, whose pernicious and headstrong Counsels has posted him to his Ru∣ine, tho' all that has been done cannot make Him sensible of it? Sure the reducing Hereticks to the See of Rome is not less Meritorious than before, nor King James the Seventh, by breathing the French Air, become less Bigot: It were a Dream to fancy it. For so long as the Vatican thunders Excommunica∣tions against all such as do not use their utmost en∣deavours to extirpate Heresie, a Roman Catholick must have no Religion at all, if they be not terri∣ble to him. The fourth Argument they made use of to per∣suade such as are and shall be chosen Members of the Convention, That it's their Interest to call back the King, is, That the Peace and Happiness of the Nation cannot be otherwise secured, nor Factions or Divisions extinguished. But what Factions do you observe, but such as they themselves do foment, on purpose to disturb our Harmony? all which would immediately die, if the Government were once setled on those who deserved it best: for then, if these Fops continued still fond of Popery and Ty∣ranny, they would be chastised, as Disturbers of the Publick Peace. The Argument may very justly be retorted; for if the King return, we will burst out into a flame; and England, which has already de∣clared, will quickly be on our Top, an Enemy too Potent and too Numerous for us, tho' we were all united; besides the Danger to which such a Proce∣dure will expose us, we cut off all hopes of an Uni∣on with that Nation, and thereby deprive our selves of an unspeakable Advantage, which would redound to all sorts of People, and would be the only means to support an impoverish'd and sinking Nation. Nei∣ther is this the only Inconveniency, tho' it be a very Great One; for if we state our selves in opposition to England, by Restoring the King whom they Re∣jected, it is not to be doubted but he will use his ut∣most endeavour to recover that Kingdom, the loss of which is so considerable. Now, seeing it were vain to suppose that the Scots alone were able to se∣cond his desires, he must needs have recourse to the French and Irish, whose Religion will procure a more intire Confidence than His Majesty can repose in any others. These therefore must be received in∣to our Bosom; and because Scotland is the most proper place for Invading England, it must be the Scence of all the Blood and Confusion that this me∣lancholly thought gives us a Prospect of. And what treatment can such Sham-Protestants expect from these, who otherwise would have become their Friends and Allies? And what Figure will they pre∣tend to make, when they set up for a separate In∣terest from all the Confederate Protestants in the World besides? The happy Success the PRINCE His Enterprize has met with, has made a considerable Alteration in the Affairs of Europe; for that great Enemy of the Protestants, and even of Christianity it self, who had propos'd nothing less to himself than an Universal Monarchy, whom the Strictest Leagues and Contracts cannot bind, but without regard to GOD or Man, threatens all his Neighbours with utter Destruction; by the Scene's being changed among us, is so far hum∣bled, that from a Proud and Insulting Enemy, he is become a Supplicant for Peace; well foreseeing that if Britain join with those other Princes, whom his Insolence, Cruelty, and Avarice, has so justly Armed against him, his Ruine is Inevitable  that if we have not Soul enough to enjoy this great Blessing, and can easily part with the Glory of being once more the Arbiters of Europe, let us at least have have so much Christian Love and Charity for the Neighbouring Na∣tions of our own Perswasion, as not to expose them to a necessary Participation of these Plagues, which our Common Enemies are preparing for us, and which will certainly Terminate in all our Destructions. Lastly, I beseech you to consider what Persons they are who would Instill this Poyson in you, and you will find them of three kinds. First, those who Postponing the Common Good of the Nation are wholly acted by Self-Interest, considering that in a Govern∣ment where Justice and Mercy equally Flourish, Vir∣tue and Merit, not Villany, will be rewarded. Se∣condly, They who are ignorant of the Nature of Government and were never at the pains to in∣form themselves what Measures the Law of Nature and Nations have set to mens Obedience, but are angry at every thing that thwarts their wild No∣tions, and will admit of nothing, tho never so rea∣sonable and convincing, if their dull Capacities cannot reach it. The third sort are such as have been instrumental in the enslaving their Country, and are a∣fraid if they be called to an Account, they may be brought to suffer Condign Punishment; if such can∣not succeed in their Design, they at least hope to be overlookt in a General Confusion, so they have no∣thing unessayed that may tend to their own safety; and if Heaven fail them, they summon Hell to their Aid; not that Love to their Prince, but meer Am∣bition and Interest, drives these Criminals to such At∣tempts, neither are they much to blame, if they are at such pains to sow Divisions among us; But no Person of Wit and Judgment, nor any Good Man that is truly Protestant, and minds the good of his Coun∣try, will suffer himself to be so grosly imposed on by such Firebrands, who would build their Future Ima∣ginary Greatness on the Ruine of Our Religion, Laws, and Country.
