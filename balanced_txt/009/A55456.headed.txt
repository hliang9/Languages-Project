To the truly Valiant Commanders, and all the rest of the Gentlemen Souldiers now going against TYRCONNEL. Magnanimous Sirs! IF I should present you with what is contain'd in the following Trea∣tise, which comprehends an Impartial History of the Ancient and Present State of Ireland, as also the Life and barbarous Actions of the Earl of Tyrconnel, &c. as binding Rules to your Ho∣nours, I should be like to that ridiculous Philosopher, who not knowing any thing of War more than some few Martial Axioms, pre∣sumed to read Military Lectures to Hannibal (one of the greatest Cap∣tains that ever Nature produc'd) your Noble and Victorious Souls be∣ing indued with such Principles of true Honour and Courage, that comprehend all Laws themselves, that direct and manage you. I therefore only assume the boldness (worthy Sirs!) to lay the follow∣ing Discourses at your Feet, humbly begging that they may be shrowded under the Wings of your most Noble Patronage. But tho this Treatise can be of no further Service to you than barely to set forth the Lustre of your own Observations, or to bring to remembrance what you have already seen or heard in your Travels abroad, yet it may be useful to o∣thers (more especially to the Souldiers under your Command) if it meet with your Protection; for none that have heard of your Fame will dare to disbelieve ought that is Patroniz'd by so Glorious Conquerours as you have lately been in the West of England, and in other Parts: And most certain it is, That every Turn of your Head, Glance of your Eye, Motion of your Hand, Step of your Foot, is a Vexation and a Plague to your Irish Enemies (the Papists) who believe your very Sha∣dow so fatal to all their Contrivances and Aims, that whilst you live they shrivel and wither, your Breath strikes Confusion to all their Plots and Devices, and therefore no wonder they so dread your Arrival in Ireland. And upon your Success or Overthrow the whole Protestant Religion in that Country seems to stand or fall. But (by the Blessing of Almighty God) none can doubt of the Success of your Arms, seeing you never yet saw Fear but in the Face of an Enemy, nor never yet knew what it was not to Vanquish: Conquest hath
always sate upon the Edge of your Swords, and Victory been written in your Foreheads. Then, Victorious Sirs! be not unwilling to add this one to your other numerous Triumphs! What if your Enemies exceed you in multitudes of men, you surpass them in number of Souldiers. The meaning of the word (Courage) is unknown among them: And for their Officers, the best of them had rather creep into a Scabbard than draw a Sword. As for their Common Souldiers, what are they? but the very Excre∣ment of Common Prisons, with which their Army is cumber'd, not mann'd. And as for their General (an Impartial Account of whose Life and Actions is here presented to your View) he is indeed a fit Captain for such a selected Company; It is the same Tyrconnel who is famed for a Coward throughout Europe; and I verily assure my self, that neither he dares think of mainiaining his Ground, or you of tosing your former Glories. Nay, indeed it is not Tyrconnel at all, but the shadow only of that Substance; for the Popish Religion he so eagerly embraces hath bruitified him to that degree, that he hath neither Humanity, Mercy, nor Pity left to the Distressed Protestants that you are now generously going to relieve. Courage then, Illustrious Hero's! brave Men of Arms, be (as you have still been) Glorious Conquerours. To speak more were to detain you from Victory. Only this, Call to mind your ancient Valour! and remem∣ber that you are true English Men and Protestants, and your Enemies Irish Papists and Rebels. And thou, O Almighty God, (who hast styled thy self the Lord of Hosts) make these worthy Commanders Success as great as their Cause is good: Teach their Hands to War, and their Fingers to fight; give unto them, and unto every one of their Fellow-Souldiers, the Strength of Sampson the Courage of David, and the Wisdom of Solomon, that they may undermine all the At∣tempts, and overthrow all the Plots of them that sight against thy Truth; yet even in the heat of Fury give them Pity, that they may rather spare than Spoil. And because Death is before their Eyes, give them Grace to be mindful of it, and prepared for it: Take their Bodies into thy Protection, and defend them; take their Souls into thy Tuition, and sanctifie them; and at last receive them into thy Glorious Kingdom, through Jesus Christ, Amen.
THE INTRODUCTION To the Following DISCOURSE: BEING A Brief Description of the Kingdom of Ireland, in its Provinces, Principal Towns, Fortresses and Situation; the Means how it came to be a Conquered Kingdom: With the sundry Rebellions made by the Natives against the Crown of England, and by what Means Reduced: And more Particularly the Horrid Massacre, An. 1645. FOR the Reader's better Comprehending the Affairs of the Kingdom of Ireland, where the Papists are Actually in Arms, under their Ring-leader the Earl of Tyrconnel; Before we enter upon our present Matter, it will not be at all Inconvenient, briefly to run over former Transactions, thereby to manifest how the Irish have behaved themselves, even in Popish times, when they had no Pretence of Religion, towards
the English; and consequently how little so unstedfast and a wavering People are to be trusted. The Kingdom of Ireland is properly divided into Four Pro∣vinces, viz. Munster, Lemster, Connaught and Ulster; and these Sub-divided, First, into the Counties of Limerick, Kerry, Cork, Waterford, Desmond and Holy-Cross in Tipperary. Secondly, Into East and West Meaths, Kilkenney, Cartelough, Kings-county, Queens-County, Kildare, Dublin and Wicklow. Thirdly, Into Clare, Thumond, Galloway, Maio, Slego, Amtrim and Rosccom∣mon. Fourthly, Into Tyrconnel or Dunghal, from whence the Earl derives his Title; Tyrone the Upper and nether, Fermanagh, Cavan or Cravan, Monaghan, Colrane, Antrim, Down, Armagh and Lough; thus stand the Counties of the Kingdom in their respective Divisions: And as for the Principal Cities and Towns, they are Kinsaile, London-Derry, Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Dublin, Tredah, Dungannon, Marleburg, Philips-Town, Kildare, Wexford and Armagh; for indeed there are no extraordinary Number of considerable Places, the Country (though it con∣tains four hundred Miles in length, and two in breadth, through the Laziness of the Natives, who for the most part delight rather in Rapine and Theft, than Honest Labour) being ex∣treamly overgrown with Woods, Bushes, Briars, and other cumbersom things. The Rivers, for want of keeping up the Banks, or cleansing, overflow upon every small Rain, and the Mountains frequently are found to thrust up their craggy shoulders, whilst the Bogs lye as low; and although they are extream large mirey, and dangerous to pass, yet the Na∣tives make it their business to find out steps and clumpers, and practise the Trotting them with so much ease, that like the Wild Indians in their Swamps and Woods, when they have committed any Outrage or Mischief, thither they betake them∣selves as to a Sanctuary; and from thence are called Bogg-trotters. But not to be tedious in this Particular, we proceed to other matter. In the year of our Lord 1172, the four Provinces of Ireland, being actually four Kingdoms possessed by petty Kings, and they contending amongst themselves in a tedious and bloody
War, the King of — worsted, and almost outed of his Dominions, made it his humble Suit to Henry the Second, King of England, for Aid against his Enemies, offering his Daughter to Richard the King's Son, with his little Kingdom for her Dowry, and urged it so far, that the Prince, preceded by one Robert Fitz-Stephens, passed the Seas with a considerable Army, contrary to the mind of King Henry, and beat the pre∣vailing Irish, recovering most of the Towns to the Sea-Coast; whereupon the King followed with a great Army, and made himself Master of so great a share of the Country, that some of the petty Kings submitting, and others not capable of oppo∣sing him, he marched to Dublin, rather at that time a poor Village than a City, for he found no House there fit for his Entertainment; and was thereupon obliged to build one, as likewise a Castle to keep them in awe, as plainly perceiving them a rude and untractable People. This and the Constitution of the English Laws setled amongst them, were as a Bridle for a time, but when King John came to the Crown, they fell into Rebellion: However, the Terror of his approach with an English Army, made them lay down their Arms, and humble themselves before him at Dublin; their Petty Kings there doing him Homage, and owning him their Sovereign Lord: From which time the Kings of England were styled Lords of Ireland. And although Edward the Third, taking care of that Kingdom, enacted many good Laws, yet were they but slen∣derly observed, for in the Reign of Richard the Second, they fell into Rebellion under the Leading of Oneal and Mackmur, which obliged that King to pass the Seas in order to quell them, but it proved Fatal to him, for in the mean time his Couzen, Henry of Lancaster, possessed himself of the Kingdom of En∣gland: But passing over many Feuds and Disorders, we find that in the time of King Henry the Eighth, the Irish attempted to make a General Revolt, under the Leading of the Earl of Tyrone and others, but had no Success, for the Lord Howard, Earl of Surrey, overthrew them, and dispersed their Power, making their Chieftains Prisoners, which compelled Tyrone to Sue for the King's Mercy, which he obtained under Oaths and
Protestations of Obedience, which indeed he observed during that King's Reign, who commanded himself to be proclaimed King of Ireland, the first King of England that took upon him that Title. But Queen Elizabeth had not been long setled in the Throne, before the same Earl, with others, drew a great Party, as well of the Wild as Civilized Irish after him, com∣mitting Horrid Outrages, and proceeded so far, as to resolve upon the utter Extirpation of the English, who for the most part lived in Towns by themselves, as not caring to mix with such an Uncivilized People: And finding himself too weak to oppose the English Forces, sent over at sundry times under the Earl of Essex, the Lord Norris, and others he Negotiated with, to the Pope and Spain for Aid; and had about six thousand Men sent by the Latter, under the Leading of Don Aquila; but those Spaniards, Fortifying themselves in Castles, and being besieged by the English, without any hope of Relief from the Irish, who had betaken themselves, through fear, to the Bogs and Moun∣tains, were glad to Capitulate for their departure with their Lives, and some small Subsistence to carry them into Spain. The Irish Success going at this rate, and Tyrone certified that Thomas Stuckle an English man, who had fled for Treason, had been prevailed upon by Don Sebastian King of Portugal, to ac∣company him into Africk with the six hundred Men the Pope had caused to be levied in the Territories of the Church, for the Service of Ireland, that Earl despairing of better Fortune against the prevailing English, plainly discovered to his Companions, how his hopes were frustrated, which made them with many Curses and Execrations, forsake the Author of their Ruin, and hide themselves in Holes and Corners; so that being in a man∣ner left alone, and a reward profered to any that would or could bring him dead or alive; and he fearing the Treachery of his Country, surrendred himself to the Lord Deputy, that he might be sent into England to plead his Cause before the Queen, where he by Petition and otherwise, laboured to exte∣nuate his Crime, and cast the cause of his Rebellion upon the Severity of her Ministers of State in that Kingdom. However he was committed to the Tower of London, in order to his
Tryal; but that great Queen dying before he was brought to it, and King James coming to the Throne, amongst other Pri∣soners, pardoned this Irish Earl, who had been the cause of extraordinary Ruin and Bloodshed to the English Protestants. But not to dwell upon what is Remote, let us now come nearer and shew the Irish Papist to the World, cloathed with all the Horrid Forms of Death and Desolation, spending Towns and Cities in Revengeful Fire. King James the First, as is said, coming to the Throne, and that wise Prince perceiving the Irish to be a stubborn Nation, resolved, instead of strength, to use such likely Policy as might with more ease bridle and keep them under; whereupon at the instance of sundry Undertakers, he seized upon the Six Counties within the Province of Ulster, and distributed Lands and Possessi∣ons as well to the English as the more civilized Natives, incou∣raging them to build Castles and walled Towns, to secure them∣selves, without the charge of a great Force, from the Incur∣sions and rude Assaults of the uncivilized People; and more∣over to wean them from their Barbarity by Trafick and Inter∣changes of Marriage as they saw or thought convenient, so that in this King's Reign, they were brought a great part of them to a tolerable good temper, seeming very well contented with their English Neighbours, who greatly improved the Country in Growth and Manufacture; and had not their Bloody Prin∣cipled Religion, and the Encouragement of their Priests incited them, perhaps they might have had some Bowels towards their Fellow-Creatures, who had obliged, but no ways injured them: Yet so it happened in the Reign of King Charles the First, Anno Dom. 1641. in October, that one Connally, taken as a Spy in Dublin, confessed upon Oath, after many Threats, that a general Rising was designed, to cut off all the Protestants in the King∣dom, and utterly to extirpate the English that inhabited amongst them: And although all care was taken by the Magistrates, as well by publick Papers as private Intelligence, to give notice that those who were designed for the Slaughter, might stand to their Arms, or make the best shifts they could in such an Extre∣mity; Yet the Irish Papists finding the Design discovered, and
by that means prevented from seizing Dublin, and some other Fortified places, they under the Leading of Sir Philim O Neal, the Lord Gurry, and others, fell upon the poor People, Cutting the Throats of some, Ripping others alive, dashing Childrens Brains out against the Posts or Pavements; and when they sus∣pected a Person Rich, they Tortured him till he had confessed his Treasure, and after that put them to Death: Others they enticed to a Discovery, under pretence of securing them to some Fortified Town, in the Protection of the English; and by this means having gotten what they desired, either killed them, delivered them up to such as did it, or left them to Starve in the Fields and Woods. Many, for Expedition, they forced Naked into Lakes, Ponds and Wells, overwhelming them with Earth and Stones: Some again had the ends of their Bowels drawn out and fastened to Posts, and so forced round, they with the points of Skeens were made to wind them out, and died in that manner: Some had their Feet cut off, and cast out to perish in the Snow. Nor had they any pity on Age or Sex, Women great with Child were exposed to all manner of Extremity, Virgins Deflowred, Women Ravished, Infants, as soon as come into the World, cast out to Dogs and Swine to be devoured. Those that fled to their nearest Relations, Landlords or Tenants, in hopes of Concealment or Protection, were perfidiously be∣trayed. The Popish Priests, that incouraged their Proceedings, declaring it to be a Sin beyond that of Judas, to conceal any Heretick, threatning at least Damnation to any that should presume it: Some they Whipped to death, others they hung up by the Privy-Members till they died of the pain, or were starved to death: A great number they burnt in Houses and Barns, whether they had fled for Refuge; and most of those they killed, were ripped open by the Irish Women that followed these Blood-hounds, only for their Fat to make Candles; and yet so Cowardly were they, that when they found any small number of Protestants in Arms, animated by Despair to stand for their Lives, then they would Wheedle them, upon pretence of granting them Quarter and Protection, and then either killed them, or delivered them up to such as did it. We might run
on till we tired the Reader, and made him turn his Eyes away from this Field of Blood, had not we promised this only for an Introduction to what more materially is intended. In this Massacre, which raged in all the Provinces like a de∣stroying Plague, for the space of three Months, before any con∣siderable Forces, capable of Suppressing, could arrive from England, 200000 of either Sex are held to be Murthered, be∣sides a greater number Ruined, Wounded, and forced to fly, perishing in Woods and Mountains; the Country, likewise, for the time, seemed a perpetual Bonfire; the Fields were made white with Bones, and the Rivers swelled with Blood; nor did the Wolves and other Beasts of Prey suffice to devour the Dead Bodies that lay piled on heaps. But this Blood did not fail to cry for Vengeance, as it soon after appeared. In the close of the Civil Wars of England, when the World plainly perceived that those who are the most resolute at base and un∣manly Murthers, are the most Cowardly when opposed in a manly way: According to the Poet, Blood-thirsty Slaves that dare not face the Foe, In Massacres and Murthers Valiant grow; When unoppos'd they use revengeful Might, But, as from Plagues, they fly all manly Fight. And now that the World may have a Prospect of the Valour of Irish Papists, and our Soldiers know what Pusilanimous things they have to deal withall; Pardon, Reader, the Enlargement, if we proceed to give you some Instances, not Immaterial to what is chiefly intended in these Papers. It so happpened, that during the Exile, or rather Retirement of King Charles the Second, the Irish Papists made a great Bustle in that Kingdom, not much unlike what they pretend to at present; giving out, that they were resolved to rend it from the English Crown or Obedience, greatly Oppressing the Pro∣testants, which made them send their Complaints to the Par∣liament Sitting at Westminster, desiring a speedy Succour to pre∣vent a second Massacre, of which they had no small Appre∣hensions.
Their Request was answered, Sir Charles Coot and Collonel Jones being sent over with such Forces as the short∣ness of Exigency would admit, and promise of a greater Supply. This obliged the Bogsters to apply themselves to the King, then in seeing they had no other colour or pretence of resistance, who thereupon was prevailed with to send thither several great Commanders, so that a great Army was raised to reduce the places that held out for the English, which were but few of Note, viz. Tredah, London-Derry, Dublin and Trim; and after some Exploits, before the Gross of the English Army could arrive, or they have any considerable Body in the Field, they set down before Dublin, with between fifteen and twenty thousand Men, and lying some days before it, without any con∣siderable Attempt, Collonel Michael Jones the Governour, to hinder the Progress and carrying on the Works, detached a Party to Sally upon those that were advancing, not intending any thing further, as expecting by the next fair Wind, an Army from England. But this small Party perceiving the Work slightly defended, and with ease beating the Advance-guard, and cutting the Pioneers in pieces, they resolved to follow the Advantage; so that being succoured from the Town, gaining still upon the Irish, the whole Garison at length sallied, not ex∣ceeding five or six thousand Men; and gaining in a trice all the Works, with a strong Fort, they had raised the Alarum, and the desperate Resolution of the English, so scared and daunted the Teague-landers, that the Rear fled in Rout and Confusion, whilst the Front made a weak Resistance: Nor could the Noble Marquess, since Duke of Ormond, who was there in Person, restrain them from throwing down their Arms, and shamefully running away, though he laboured to do it, and to restore the Battle, with all the Prudence and Courage of so great a Com∣mander. And thus you may see what those that rely on them may trust to. In this Defeat they lost about five thousand Men, besides those that were taken Prisoners, with all their Tents, Baggage, and Ammunition; so that instead of catching the Tartar, they, it seems, were catched themselves. Soon after this Cromwel
landed with an Army, reduced the whole Kingdom in less than a year, except some inconsiderable Towns inclosed with Boggs and Mountains, which rendred them either Inaccessible, or not worth the trouble or loss of Men, which could not have been avoided in such Attempts; and indeed here we must needs confess, as Christians, the English Zeal, in consideration of the former Massacre, waded too far in Blood, by putting three Towns to the Sword, in which, no doubt, were a great many Protestants that fell without distinction. And thus much by way of Introduction, from which we proceed to what is more largely promised in the Title Page, &c.
THE HISTORY OF THE Life and Actions OF Richard Talbot EARL OF TYRCONNEL: WITH What Memorably happened, relating to him and others, in the Kingdom of Ireland, from the time of his first Acting there in Publick Affairs, to this time, &c. SINCE the Papists in Ireland have found themselves at large under a Person, who conceives it Meritorious to promote the Interest of the Romish Church; and consi∣dering how Bloody and Cruel-minded the Sons of that Mother of Harlots are; we must from what has been already declared,
be constrained to confess, the Protestants whose Persons and Estates are in that Kingdom, cannot be without dreadful Appre∣hensions of the Fatal Consequence: And indeed what could have been expected, had not the Almighty Hand of Providence wrought this sudden and almost unexpected Change in England; which gives them a reviving prospect, of having themselves and their Posterity freed from the hard Yoke of Popery and Slavery, which exceeds all others; for it extends not only to Bodies and Estates, but even to the Enslaving the Consciences and Souls of Men, which above all is the most intolerable? Long indeed had the Popish Party, which there is much the greater number, laboured and used their uttermost Interest, with the Kings of England, to have a Deputy or Lieutenant of their own Stamp and Coining, but have found their Solicitations ineffectual, though backed and strengthened with many plau∣sible Pretences of Interest and Advantage to the Crown, till a Prince of the Roman Communion gave way to it, and thought fit, before so many Worthy English Noble-men, to advance a Person of no extraordinary Birth or Parts, removing, to make way for him, one that should have been Dearer, by reason of Alliance. But it is not for us to enter into the Cabinet-Councils and determinate thoughts of Princes; and therefore we leave the World to conjecture, by so much as has been perspicuous to Mankind, to what end this Person was advanced: And since the Noise he has made Abroad, and the Transactions of that King∣dom, have been very Remarkable, It is our purpose to give an account of many significant Particulars, as well as Generals, as at sundry times hapned, thereby to render a satisfaction to such as are but slenderly informed, or in a manner Ignorant of these Affairs. As for this Person, who has lately made such a Bluster in Ireland, he appears, as far as can be gathered, to be the Son of an ordinary Gentleman of the Family of the Talbots in Ireland, Christened by the Name of Richard, and brought up according to the Custom of that Country, in no extraordinary Literature; nor, by reason of the Roughness of his Temper, not very capable of attaining any Superlative Acquirements in Learning, being come
to some years of Maturity, and conceiving his Patrimonial Fortune too Scanty, his thoughts began to resolve themselves into a De∣sign of seeking that Advantage Abroad, which with Reason and Justice, he could not expect at Home: Launching out into these Resolutions, by the example of others prone to the like under∣taking, with what Accoutraments his Condition would furnish him withall, Don Quixot like, he set out upon Knight Errantry, in hopes, no doubt, to be Dubbed, and we see there is no failure in that Expectation. In France he gave considerable atten∣dance upon Honour and Preferment, but found them of so slen∣der a make, that he thought them not suitable to his Ambition: However at that time it was not remedied, yet by degrees, some notice being taken of his forwardness, he engaged in the Army; but as to his great Actions, or Memorable Exploits, they have not, by any private or publick notice, come to our hand; nor do those that have been since Conversant with him, remember to have seen any Scar or Mark of Disaster in War in his Face or elsewhere; or that he expresses any greater Glory of himself or Actions, than that he is become the Champion of the Roman Cause. But this is certain, being arrived to the pitch of a Colonel by degrees, and the French Interest not prospering so well as he could wish, it was apparent that the Climate disgusted him, especially at what time he felt the warm Rays of Favour dart from England; and therefore shook off a petty Foreign Service, that brought no great Advantage, for one, or at least in Expectation of one greater near Home. About this time the Face of things beginning somewhat to change their former Aspects; and instead of Worth and Inte∣grity, Favour and Interest taking place at Court, this Person found such Countenance (we do not say by the Means of the Priests, who knew him to be a Traveller, and consequently a Man fit for Business) that he was put into a considerable Station in Ireland, and got much Applause, in declaring a more than ordi∣nary Fervency for the Cause, Damming the Popish Plot, though evidently manifested in the Reign of King Charles the Second, and since more apparent to the depth of Erebus, punishing any under his Power or Jurisdiction, that durst but name it unless in ridicule.
For these and the like Services he was made yet greater, and had the whole Power of the Kingdom of Ireland committed to his Charge, which so exalted the Spirits of the Papists there, that they openly and with Confidence, declared the Protestant Religion should be suppressed and brought under foot: As ap∣pears by a Preface to the Lord Bishop of Kilmore's Sermon against Popery, preached at St. Warburgh's Church in Dublin, March 22. 1684/5. where, amongst other things, his Lordship has these Expressions, viz. Notwithstanding (sayes he) their causeless heights, and the confident Brags of some of them, that our Religion shall soon be suppressed, and the Wheedles of others of them, by which they think to prevail with us, if not to come over to theirs; yet, to speak nothing in confutation of it, we both dare and will justifie our selves and our Religion, against all the little petty Arts of Defamation or Calumny they can use against us, &c. By this we may see how early the Papists began to take upon them, as dreaming of nothing more than an entire Restorarion of Popery; nor is it to be forgot, with what unbecoming slight this Person used the Right Honourable the E. of C. during his being Lord Lieutenant of that Kingdom, whose Orders he ought to have obeyed; but without shewing any warrantable Com∣mission for so doing, he displaced the Protestant Officers, and put Papists in their room, who confirmed in such Offices as he knew would stick to the Interest of Mother Church: the next Practice was upon the standing Force, and first Teague O D'evele the Priest took the Souldiers in handling, to Doctor them with Holy Water and Wafers, Swearing by St. Patrick's Shoo-buckle, if they would not go to Mass, and be good Catholicks, they should not only be Discarded, but lose all their Arrears. And so it proved, for Talbot, by this time made Earl of Tyrconnel, causing them to be drawn up in Companies, commanded them to lay down and quit their Arms; which done, they were expresly told, that it was the King's Pleasure to have none but Roman Catholicks in his standing Forces of that Kingdom, and as many as would comply with it, might return to their Arms, and those that would not might depart; Which a considerable number did, rather choosing to struggle with Necessity, than to violate their
Consciences. And many of them afterward got into Holland, &c. entring into the Service of the States; however there were those ready provided that stepped into their places, and took up their Arms. Of these Proceedings, and many others, Complaint was made to the Court of England, and the Earl was sent for, who came over in much State and Equipage; but he was too precious and useful an Instrument to be either check'd or laid by. Father Petre who was advanced from Confessing Kitchin-Wenches and Foot-Boys, to steer at the Helm of Government, knew him Thorough-paced, and therefore his Interest was not wanting. So that contrary to the Expectation of all Men, instead of going back with Disgrace, he was, by a strange Metamorphosis, changed from a little Commander, into a Lord Deputy of the Kingdom of Ireland, and a far Worthier Person recalled to give him place. And he, with a considerable Trane, passed over with his Commission, being received by the Papists in Triumph, with, as some will have it, the Song of, Ho Brother Teague d'ye hear the Decree, &c. No sooner the Earl found himself invested with Power and Honour in so extraordinary a Degree, as to be Viceroy of a Kingdom, but he began to think himself more than a Man, look∣ing down upon all beneath him as Atoms, and things only sub∣ject to be formed at his will and pleasure; and came so near the Turkish Motto of Sic volo sic jubeo, stat pro ratione voluntas, That the Irish Protestants became very sensible they stood with their new Master; for now the Popish Priests, whose Insolencies had before been restrained, began to whet their Teeth for the Prey, expecting a sweet Morsel of Church Lands; but whilst they were Forming many pleasant Conceits, and wagging their Heads, like Esop's Dog over the Roast-Meat, when he had in∣vited his Fellow-Curs to Supper; all of a sudden News came, that a mighty Storm was coming from the North-East Quarter, which would go near to overturn the Sandy Foundation they had built upon. But to be more Serious,
The suddain Consternation in England, amongst the Papists, occasion'd from Holland, caused an Express to be sent over to Ireland, for the Forces in Arms, that could conveniently arrive with speed; but not being overwilling or forward to venture, the Priests took them to task, and by many Arts and Insinuati∣ons strove to oblige them to a ready and chearful Embarkment. But all the promises of Heaven, and Exemption from so much as calling at Purgatory by the way, would do nothing, till the Earl found out a better method; which was to cause it to be spread amongst them, upon their Arrival, they should not only be the Kings immediate Guard, and be magnificently Enter∣tain'd, but have Houses and Lands assigned them, with many other matters. And if common Fame may be Credited, ac∣cording to sundry Reports, when these Forces came over, they fell peremptorily to claiming the Houses and Possessions, where they first Quartered, upon their Landing, little dreaming they might according to that Tenure, and by the same Right, pick and chose in Cheapside or Lombard-street. But passing over such deluded Blockheads, as to Leases and Lands, this we may affirm with credible Testimony, that on the Road as they Marched to∣wards London, they not only seiz'd upon Horses of Travellers, as also the Country Carts and Waggons, under pretence of car∣rying their Baggage, which was almost as light as a Camelion, only upon the account of Extorting Mony for the releasing them, but made a bloody Massacre upon Pigs, Hens and Ducks, and where-ever a Goose came to their handling, they so ordered it, that she was never taken for a Goose afterward. In London, it's true, fear obliged the dear Joys to some moderation. These being the top of the Country, (and as Father Petre, according to the Information he had received, declared to be very good Catholicks) had not a little stress layed upon the success of their Arms; however the overruling Providence saved them, (unless in a small Skirmish, near Reading, where a few of the Horse were posted) the trial of their Courage. About this time the Foreign Forces, and such English Noble∣men and others that had joyned them (So great was the Con∣fusion at Whitehall) with the Priests packed up their Auls, as
plainly perceiving they had made the best of their Markets, and scamper'd for safety, as they found an opportunity to get off, never thinking themselves secure till they, or as many of them as escaped, had Earth'd in France or Flanders. And the King upon his hasty Retreat from Salisbury, perceiving all things tot∣tering and unstable that should have tended to his Interest, ha∣ving on the tenth of December sent away the Queen and her Re∣tinue, who partly by Land and partly by Water, getting to the Sea coast, near Dover, Embarked for France himself on the Eleventh of December 1688. took Water privately, at the back Stairs of Whitehall Palace, accompanied with a slender Retinue, about Three in the Morning, to the great Consterna∣tion of the Court; but within Three days after he was disco∣vered, in disguise, at Feversham in Kent, endeavouring to make for France; and being entreated by the Lords at Whitehall, there Assembled, to consult for the Tranquility of the King∣dom, he came back on the Sixteenth of the same Month. But on the Eighteenth, pursuant to a Message sent to entreat him to retire to Ham-House, he rather chose to be at Rochester, and there at the House of Sir Richard Head, he was pleased to ac∣cept of Entertainment, till the Twenty fecond, and then pri∣vately withdrawing himself, took Shiping and Landed in France, where he found the Queen; and was received by the French King and his Court with demonstrations of Friendship. The Irish Soldiers that came over, and in the field, were commanded to lay down their Arms and submit to Mercy, which with much grumbling and repugnancy they did; and were afterward, upon notice that Tyrconnel had Armed the Pa∣pists in Ireland, sent for their better security to the Isle of Wight, to expect further Orders how to be disposed of; but part of them under the Command of Collonel Scot, being Ingarrison∣ed in Portsmouth, made a shew of resistance; but hearing great preparations were making against them, they capitulated. Ma∣ny other things hapned of this kind, as an Alarum in the dead of the Night, in most considerable Cities and Towns in Eng∣land, that the Irish were in Arms, killing Men, Women and Children, burning the Houses, &c. and so far the terror of it
wrought, that the People every where stood to their Arms, till it was discovered to be a False Alarum, taken at first, as it is reported, from a parcel of half-starved Dear Jo s, Scuffling with an Old Chandler-woman at Hounslow for a Loaf and Cheee. However, the more Judicious are apt to conclude, there must be something in it, beyond this report, or it could not have been carried so swiftly to divers places far distant, at almost one and the same time. But leaving the true Cause in the dark, for it has not been hitherto brought to light, we return again to Ireland. No sooner came the News to Tyrconnel, that England was in the quiet possession of the Protestants, but he gave notice of it in all places inhabited by Papists, as well in the Mountains as Plains and Valleys, commanding them to Arm with such Wea∣pons as they had, and repair to the General Rendezvous some Miles from Dublin; but finding they came not in so fast as he ex∣pected, the Priests had orders to threaten and terrifie them with all the Bug-bears they could think on; telling them in their Ser∣mons, how Meritorious it was, to rise up in so Holy a Cause; and above all, protested, that those that refused, should not have the Benefit of Confession; this was such a Thunder-bolt, as made them cry O Hone, &c. So that with a Missalene of Pitchforks, Staves, Hooks, old Swords and Guns, they marched over the Bogs and Mountains to meet their General; nay, the very Tories or Out-lawed Thieves were invited, with promise of Pardon to such as came in to the Assistance of Mother Church: By which means a great number Imbattled on the Plain, some trailing their whole Faily after them, who knew not in their Absence how to subsist; and it had been worth Ob∣servation, to have taken a View of this Black-Guard. Some of them had whisps of Straw or Hay-bands about their Head instead of Hats: Others tatter'd Coats or Blankets cast over them, without any Breeches, so that the Spectators might easily perceive their Whimwhoms keep time with every motion of Exercise: Stockings and Shooes were in a manner strangers to them; and as for Shirts, one amongst three proved a Miracle: However they were Mustr'd, with a promise of speedy finding out Semstresses, Sail-men, Haber-dashers and Shoo-makers.
The Proceedings of the Earls making the Protestants more apprehensive of danger; Several, as well Noble-men as others, sent to know what he meant by drawing together such a Multi∣tude of Papists, to the disturbance of the Kingdom: But at that time could get no other Answer, than that he was resolved to stand his ground and defend the Kingdom; which obliged the Noble-men, especially in the North, to Arm themselves, Friends, Tenants, &c. resolving not only to stand upon their Defence, but as much as in them lay, oppose the Earl's Proceedings, not omitting to send Expresses to England, setting forth the State and Condition of Ireland. This made him conclude there was no better Expedient, than to Disarm the Protestants that lay within the Circle of his Command; and immediately they were summoned to bring in their Arms, under severe Penalties: But although some compied through Fear, yet others standing off, he sent his Locusts abroad to compell them, who taking Beef, Mutton, Bacon, Bread and Cheese, &c. for Helmets, Coats of Male, Bucklers and Gantlets, carried them away in Triumph, with such Weapons as they found; and many were Imprisoned, for being suspected of Concealment; others Amerced at 50 or 100 Harpers a piece, which they said, was done more to put a Terror into others, thereby to ceter them from disobeying, than for any Lucre, &c. though he that knows an Irish Man's Conscience and Covetousness, had neeed have a large Stock of Faith to believe it. The next thing that they undertook, was to seize upon such Towns and places of strength, as they supposed might prove Disadvantageous to them upon the Arrival of the English; the Ear being no ways Ignorant, that effectual Measures would be tken to send over Forces; so that finding the Walls of some Towns and Castles very Ruinous, he caused them to be re∣paired, and Moats drawn round them, Palizadong and In∣trenching, as the Situation or Necessity required; and for the better carrying on what he had undertaken, divers Consults were held, by whose pretended Authority, Sums of Money were exacted of dvers Persons, and those that had not ready Mony, were obliged to bring in their Cattel to the Value of the
Sum demanded. An Order was exhibited for the Sale of Com∣missions to raise more Forces, and that they should know with∣out much courting or attendance, whether those that desired the Preferment, were able or not to purchase it: A certain Rate was set, and for those that had no Cash, six Cows was the price of a Captains Commission, four of a Lieutenants, and two of an Ensigns, or they had liberty to pay it in any other kind, viz. in Sheep, Calves, Pigs, &c. But this amounting to no great Sum, nor being sufficient to feed the Souldiers, another Method was taken, viz. seizing the Profits and Rents of such Protestant Noble-men and Gentlemen, as were or had been in Arms, either in England or Ireland, against the Popish Interest, commanding the Tenants to make ready Payments, on pain of repaying it, and suffering Military Execution, to any, except those he should ap∣point to receive it, demanding of their Stewards a Land-Roll, &c. of their Estates, and putting Souldiers in Garison into their Castles and Houses, some of which he is at the charge of Forti∣fying; and into others puts Guards to keep under the Protestants, who are yet peaceable, from going over to those that are in Arms; and has sent some Expresses into France, to procure Arms, Ammunition and Moneys, which he declared to his Confederates, would be sent upon that notice; for although a great many Arms have been seized, and delivered to his Souldiers that came in unarmed, yet they could at this time be but very slenderly furnished; and to supply the place of Pikes, till a further Advantage or better can be got, they were obliged to use long Ash-poles sharpned at the end, and hardned in the Fire, so that if a Stranger beheld them stragling, he would take them for Gold-sinders or Night-men: As for those that are Mounted, except those of the better sort, or such as were of the standing Forces, to see them march at a distance, it would be difficult, by reason of the smallness of their Horses, to deter∣mine whether they rode or went on foot. Thus having given an account, as we may term it, of the be∣ginning of Affairs in Ireland; but the Papists proceeding to be every day more and more in earnest, and the Protestants in Arms under divers Noble-men, as resolute to oppose them, and secure
the Interest of England in that Kingdom, we now proceed to greater Matters. The Parliament of England being pressed by a compassionate Inclination, to rescue Ireland from the Imminent Dangers that threaten it, and it being a Kingdom wherein the English have so great a share and Interest, as also the Crown an Absolute Juris∣diction over it, by right of Conquest. Upon the Proclamation of King William and Queen Mary, took especial care, as they had often before done, to recommend the Safety of the King∣dom of Ireland to their Majesties immediate and peculiar Con∣sideration, in order to the sending a fit number of Forces to re∣duce the Papists in Arms, and free the Protestants from the Apprehensions of Danger they lay under. To which they re∣ceived a very Gracious and Satisfactory Return to this pur∣pose, viz. That nothing should be wanting to effect what they desired, and that it should not be only effected with all conve∣nient speed, but so effectual, that with the Blessing of God, it should not fail to answer their Expectations; nor was it delayed, Officers were appointed, and Souldiers raised in all parts of England, without the Difficulty that has been seen on other occasions, in great numbers: And amongst others, the Shoo∣makers went in considerable Bodies to wait upon their Majesties, and offer themselves and Service, which was favourably ac∣cepted. By which means they have the opportunity to try with the Irish Papists, whether St. Crispin or St. Patrick will prove the more Auspicious. And to the intent that the Irish in Arms under Tyrconnel, may be left without excuse, when they find the Effects of the Misery they have drawn upon themselves, by taking up Arms, and disturbing a Kingdom in which they might have lived quietly and peaceably; a Declaration by the King and Queen was Exhibited on the 22d of February in these words, viz. WHereas it is Incumbent upon us, to take care and preserve all our Subjects within our Dominions, of what Perswasion soever, in Matters of Religion; and we being highly sensible of the Miseries of our Kingdom of Ireland, is and may be exposed to, by
the Forces there raised and kept up under pretence of Religion, at the In∣stigaion of Romish Priests, and by the influence of Foreign Counsels, in opposition to us and our Government; and being desirous to prevent the Calamities and Destruction that must fall upon our People in that King∣dom, in case the Forces now ready to enter the said Kingdom, (which we doubt not but with God's help may be sufficient to reduce it to our Obedi∣ence) shall proceed to effect the same; We do hereby declare, and promise to all our Loving Subjects whatsoever within that Kingdom full and en∣tire Pardon and Indemnity for all things by them acted, done or com∣mitted by vertue or colour of any Authority, or pretended Authority, within the said Kingdom, and a full and free enjoyment of their respective Estates according to the Law; in case, upon notice of our Royal Will and Pleasure, signified in this our Declaration, they shall lay down their Arms, and retire to their respective Habitations and Places of Abode, at, or before the tenth day of April next there, and shall peaceably be∣have themselves, and live as good Subjects ought to do. And we do hereby further declare and promise to all our Subjects of the Romish Church, that hitherto have not taken Arms, or that shall upon notice of this our Declaration lay down their Arms, and retire, and live as aforesaid, that they shall for the future have all the favour for the private Exercise of their Religion that the Law allows, and we can now grant to them; and that we shall speedily call a Parliament in the said Kingdom, and therein promote a further Indulgence to them. And we do hereby further Declare, That if, notwithstanding this our Declaration, any of our Subjects shall continue in Arms, in opposition to us, that we shall then think our selves free and clear of all the Blood that may be spilt, and the Destruction and Misery which by reason thereof may be occasion'd; and we shall look upon our selves to be justified bfore God and Man in our Proceedings by Force and Arms against them as Rebels and Traytors, and such we do hereby declare all those to be, who shall Act as aforesaid against our Authority, as is herein expressed; and that the Lands and Estates of all such as shall after notice of this our Declaration persist in their Rebellion, or be any wise Abettors thereof, and which by Law will be forfeited unto us, shall be by us distributed and disposed to those that shall be aiding and assisting in reducing the said Kingdom to its due Obedience.
This Declaration did not a little allarm Tyrconnel and his Ad∣herents: However, having sent to France, and expecting some extraordinary return, he declared, He would not part with his Sword, but rather use it to defend himself, and free his Country; nor would he hearken to those who went about to perswade him to lay hold of the favourable opportunity, whilst he might pro∣cure honourable Conditions for himself and his Confederates; but continuing in an obstinate humour, he rather cast in his mind how he might weaken the Protestants that yet remained in the Kingdom. For indeed the Insolence of the Papists had put such a Fear into the hearts of many, that they shipped themselves, and their Effects, by stealth, for England and Scotland, by reason Tyrconnel had caused all the Ports at Dublin, Cork, &c. to be stopt, and no Passenger to go off without leave: Nay, to prevent as much as in him lay a Correspondence between the Kingdoms, Pacquets and Letters were searched, and those stopped that con∣tained any relation of the Proceeding, or Transactions of Ire∣land. Ships were likewise order'd not to set Sayl, or offer it, under pain of Confiscation, without especial leave, and the Ef∣fects of some English seized. But this he thought not sufficient, nor himself secure, till he had altogether assured him of the Ca∣pital Cities, &c. And in order thereunto he sent a competent number of his Troops to march in the Night-time to Dublin without Beat of Drum, or Sound of Trumpet, by which means they, upon the first appearance of day, seized upon the Skirts of the City, posting Troops at the Heads and Turnings of every Street; and soon after three Companies commanded by Captain Talbot surprized the Colledge, swearing to kill any that made re∣sistance, having a Basket of Hand-granadoes in readiness; and then sending for the Magistrates, Tyrconnel's Declaration was Read, commanding all Persons to bring their Swords, Bagonets, Fire-arms, and others, to the Doors of their respective Parish-Churches, and deliver them up to such Officers as should be ap∣pointed to receive them; as likewise the seisure of all their Horses, under pretence, that many of that City were gone to the North, and had joyned with those that were in Arms against him: And of this the Lord Mayor and Common Council were order'd
to give notice, further declaring, That if any Person whatso∣ever, should, in contempt of his Order, neglect producing their said Fire-Arms, Ammunition, Swords and Bagonets, their Houses and all secret places should be searched by the Souldiers with all the care imaginable, and where any such Arms should be found, the Person or Persons owning them, should not only be punished as Contemners of the Order, but run the Risk of the ill Consequences that would inevitably fall upon them by the Disorder of the Souldiers; yet in this Order Persons of Quality had leave to reserve the Swords only that they ordina∣rily wore. This was immediately put in Execution in all parts and places, and then the Dragoons proceeded to break open the Stable-doors, and search in Vaults and Cellars for Horses they pretended were concealed; which being taken, they were by Lot divided amongst the Officers and Troopers, wounding divers Prsons in the Search that made any Opposition or Repugnancy, plundering their Houses, not sparing those that had Tyconnel's Licence to keep Arms for the Defence of their Houses, as Sir Arthur Langford, Mr. Barton, Sir Thomas Newcomen, Mr. Peirce and others; the Arms they laid up in Churches, till they pro∣vided Carriages to bear them off; and so suspicious were they, that lest any should escape by Shipping, during this Confusion, or conceal their Arms on Board, Guards were placed upon the Decks, and at all the passages by Rings-end: And a solemn Procession was made for a Blessing to their Design; the Sheriffs of every County had likewise orders to Seize upon the Estates and Effects of such as were gone to England without leave: and to supply the Defect of Mony, much Plate has been borrowed on the publick Faith, in order to be Coined or cut out at a cer∣tain weight. And the more to find an occasion against such of the Protestants as were in his power or reach, he consulted the Priests about new Oaths to be imposed, thereby to try which way they stood affected to the Popish Interest; and to encou∣rage his own Party, daily gave out that his Royal Master was coming from France with a great Power; which he laboured to confirm, by the Arrival of some Ships from that Coast, who
instead of some Forces, brought only a few Officers, with a small provision of Arms; one, in which were about a hundred Men, was reported to be cast away within sight of Land, and all that were on Board perished. During these Transactions, the Protestants in the North, fearless of the many Threats with which the Deputy thought to Terrifie and Amuse them, took daily new Courage, and in∣creased their Number, supplying themselves as well as they could from Scotland, &c. with Powder and what else they wanted in Ireland, making Reprizal on the Papists for the Losses they sustained in other Parts. And here it will not be amiss, to give an account of a pleasant Passage, according to the Relation we received from credible hands, viz. Captain Coot a very Wor∣thy Gentleman, being Active in crossing the Designs of the Papists, and asserting the Protestant Interest, one of Tyrconnel's Officers undertook to surprize him, and bring him Prisoner to the Camp; and so with eight or ten Troopers, went towards the place of his Residence, sending a dissembling Letter filled with many feigned Pretences of Friendship, and his relinquishing the Popish Interest, and that he was desirous to confer with him, about Matters mainly conducing to the Interest of England. Upon this Captain Coot sent him word he would meet him, appointing the place for that purpose; but proceeded with so much caution, as to carry with him a strong Guard, which he left in a Wood a little distant from the place appointed for the Interview, and so proceeded to meeting this promising Friend, who like a true Irish Papist, dissembled no longer than he thought he had him in his power; for instead of what he had before proposed, he plainly told him, he was fooled in be∣lieving what had been sent to him; and that his business was no other, than to carry him to Tyrconnel, and to him he must go immediately, commanding his Troopers to dismount and bind him; the which whilst they were doing, his own Men, who from their Covert beheld what had passed, came on full speed, and not only rescued their Captain, but took all his Surprizers Prisoners; yet they only carried the Officer to Sligo, dismissing the Troopers after they had taken their Horse and Arms, as
not thinking them worth the Provision they would stand them in keeping. And the Lord Blaney falling suddenly with a strong Party into the Town of Armagh, surprized Captain Machoone, and the Troop of Papists he had raised for the service of Tyrcon∣nel; who thereupon flung down their Arms and begged Quarter, which was granted them. And about this time we had it strongly reported, that the Marquess Du-Ponte arrived from France in a Man of War, and Landing at Cork, was conveyed to Dublin in Tyrconnel's Coach; and a great Train of Atten∣dants sent for that purpose; being received some distance from the City, by the Earl and his Life-guard with much State, and conducted to the Castle, where he declared the French King his Master had sent him to learn the State of Affairs in that Kingdom, delivering him at the same time a Letter to that pur∣pose: Whereupon he gave order to his Secretary and others to answer it; in which the Popish Army was affirmed to be be∣tween 30 and 40000 Horse and Foot; and that he had com∣manded all Persons capable of bearing Arms, from Sixteen to Sixty, immediately to take the Field; obliging the Priests neither to Confess nor give Absolution to such as delayed it: And that he had secured such Towns as he thought might turn to his greatest Advantage, and laid up Stores of Provision therein, as fearing a Scarcity, by reason there was no great prospect of Tillage, when all hands were otherwise imployed. And it is further alledged, that the French Marquess told Tyrconnel, his Master, though his Will was not wanting, could do no more than assist him with some Officers, Arms and Ammunition, but as for Men or Mony, he expected his own Affairs would be more urgent than to suffer him to contribute assistance of that nature. However, to divertize the Marquess, and shew him the Dexterity of his Teague-landers, he ordered them to draw up in Battalia, and imitate a Mock-fight with the English, in which hapned many extravagant and ridiculous Actions; and amongst other things, they turned Jest into Earnest, viz. a Party being taken, and ordered to be trussed up with a Withe about his Neck, and a heap of Turfs under his Feet, so that he might easily stand on them, it so fell out, that whilst those that were
to watch him, went out to engage another Mock-party, the Turfs slipped away, and the Fellows hands being tied, he no ways able to help himself, and not being timely succoured, after making several wry mouths, lost his five Senses past recovery, which made the old Proverb good, viz. There is no Jest like a true Jest. The Papists growing very Insolent in Dublin, divers Com∣plaints were made to the Earl, but he appeared little to hearken to, or regard them; nor could he be prevailed with to redress the Outrages and Insolencies committed by his Souldiers, de∣claring, it was not for his Interest, at that time to punish or dis∣please them: And when he was pressed by the Archbishop and others, to assure them of his Protection; he plainly replied, he could not positively promise it them any longer: Which obliged many to withdraw themselves, with what Effects they could conveniently carry off, rather contenting themselves with that and their own Safety, than to hazard both, by lying at the discretion of men that are Strangers to Mercy or Compassion towards Protestants; who spared not at this time, to Rob and Plunder without controul, fetching the Corn and Cattel from all the Countries adjacent, the Owners not daring to controle them, though at the same time themselves and their Families are thereby reduced to great Distress: Nor are they only contented to take the Provisions for their own Necessities, but waste and spoil more than they eat; killing many Cattel only for their Skins to make Brogues of, that is, a sort of Irish Shoos, clapping the hairy side next their Feet, and the raw side, without any dressing, to the ground, sowing them with Needles and Pack-thread, or pinning them on with Skewers; they likewise Boyl their Meat in those Hides for want of Kettles; in this manner, the Irish Cook sets up four Stakes in Quadrangle, and fastens the four corners of the Skin to the top of them, suffering it to hang bagging or bellying down, with the hairy side outward, about a foot and a half from the ground, then they put in the Water and Meat, and make a Fire under it, in which manner the Skin being kept moist by the Water, will serve twice before it becomes useless by cracking or shriveling.
In the County of Cork they drove away above 10000 Head of Cattel, and seized in the Stores of one Person 500 Barrels of Salt, from another Person 1500 Sheep, and a great many Horses, from a third, and under pretence of searching for Letters and Advices, Plundered the Houses, the Souldiers Quartering at Discretion, and devouring without controle whatever came in their way, the Owners not daring to gainsay or refuse it, for fear of having their Throats cut, or Houses fired about their Ears; which renders People Heartless to labour, considering it is not for themselves, but others, and the Souldiers as obstinate to con∣tinue their Dissolute and Licentious way of living upon the Spoil and Pillage, especially the most Hunger-starved amongst them, who before lived Poor and Miserable, for the most part upon Leeks, Brown Bread, Poor Jack and Bay-Salt, being altogether Strangers to any Liquor, but Adams Ale; nor do the Priests Rebuke them in their Sermons, but altogether incite and encourage them in it, telling them, what they take from the Hereticks (for such they term the Protestants) is no other than the Israelites spoiling the Egyptians, and it is rather commendable in them, than any Crime, to persevere in so doing; and to keep them more strictly to their Arms, they render a Protestant Go∣vernment extreamly Monstrous and Dangerous, terrifying them with the Representation of dreadful Ideas if they submit, as being Slaves on Earth, when they have an opportunity to redeem them∣selves, and cast off the English Yoke; promising them on the other hand (what they are never able to give them) Heaven and Everlasting Happiness, if they dye with their Swords in their Hands. This Animates the Rabble and Rascality to so great a Degree, that the Herdsmen, Cow-boys, Swineherds and Plow∣men go Armed to Mass, with such sorts of Weapons as they can get by Plunder or Purchase: So that the Tenants, by the Routs and Outrages that are daily made, are rendred incapable of pay∣ing their Rent. Nor is this all, for of late several French Privateers have appeared upon the Coast, which prevents many, that to avoid the Storm, would pass into England or Scotland, or make any returns of the Mony they have left; and a Justice of that
Kingdom, going for England with his Lady and Goods, Tyr∣connel upon notice of it, sent to fetch him back with his Goods and Monies, commanding him, as a Judge, immediately to go for Westmeath with a Guard, and Try one Philips, Mr. Bowyen, and others, taken there and Imprisoned on pretence of holding Correspondence with the Protestants in the North, granting him a Commission of Oyer and Terminer for that purpose; further declaring, As he behaves himself in that proceeding he must expect to be dealt with all, as to the restoring of his Goods and acquiting his person, for attempting, without leave, to for∣sake the Kingdom, and consequently leaving the place of so important a Magistrate vacant. And about this time it was strongly reported that the French King had sent the Earl a Pre∣sent of a considerable number of Livers, with Tents and Arms, encouraging him to go on and persist, to keep the Sword he has taken up in his Hand, which made him to shew the Bringer he was not idle, sends a Detatchment of Horse and Foot to West Meath, Ulster, and other places, to Disarm such Prote∣stants who had not as yet had their Houses visited, Commanding the Collonels, Talbot and Hamilton, to March into the North, with a strong Party, as well to keep the Protestants from gathering, as to have an Eye upon the motion of those in Arms. Whilst these things were doing in Ireland, great care was taken in England for the raising new Forces, to joyn with those already Listed and in Arms, as likewise to stop suspected Persons who attempted to Ship themselves without leave or Licence, in any of the Ports lying over against Ireland, till they could give a good account of themselves, that they were not going to assist the Irish Papists. Ships of War were ordered likewise to stand to that Coast, to prevent any Landing from France, and disperse the French Privateers, who very much in∣commoded those Seas. And the Honourable House of Com∣mons, to declare their resolution, Voted on the 27th of Fe∣bruary, viz. That the House would stand by the King, with their Lives and Fortunes, to support his Alliances abroad, to reduce Ire∣land, and to preserve the Protestant Religion at home. So that all
things went on in a prosperous way, and the great expectation the Earl of Tyrconnel had of Succours and Supplies from France dayly lessened as to any effectual number. However, to make the best of his Markets, whilst the time seemed favourably to serve him, he resolved to bring the Protestants as low as his Power could reduce them; so that not content with the spoil his Troops had made in and about Dublin, he commanded them to do the like in the Provinces of Munster, Lemster, and Con∣naught, where for the most part, without any provocation, they disseized the Protestants of their Inheritance, plundering them of their Arms, Horses and Goods, Imprisoning sundry of the Chief, as well Noblemen, Gentry, and others that fell into their Hands by surprize; and on the Twenty fifth of February a great number of Irish Horse and Foot came to Cork, and about midnight, to the great terror of the Inhabitants, who ex∣pected nothing less than a Massacre, entred their Houses and seized their Arms, and the next day took away all their Horses, using the same method in all the Neighbouring Villages; they broke likewise into the Houses of several eminent Citizens, and mistaking Mony for Arms, carried it away as free booty; and on the Twenty sixth, the Lieutenant General Macarty, ha∣ving with the Spoils and Plunder of the English encreased his Horse, by mounting his Bogtrotters on such Horses as he had seized, with two Field pieces he Marched towards Castlemart, the House of Captain Henry Boyle, who had with him about an Hundred and forty Gentlemen and Servants, to make a Defence against the violence of the Irish; but being by his Friends per∣swaded not to make any resistance, upon the Lieutenant Gene∣rals promise, that neither their Persons nor Estates should be molested, but without the least regard to his word, which ought to have been sacred to a Man, either pretending to Honour or Honesty, the next Morning he caused the House to be Plunder∣ed, and made the Captain, with divers of his Friends, such as himself thought fit to pick out and distinguish, as altogether averse to the Popish Cause, and in a disgraceful manner convey∣ed them, under a strong Guard, to the City of Cork; and in his way thither, drove the Country of the Cattle belonging to
Protestants, accounting them, as has before been hinted, a law∣ful prize; nor could this content them, without Quartering at discretion, and robbing them: and so proceeded to March to∣wards Bandon, with a considerable Force, in order to Besiege it, giving out bloody threatnings in case of an obstinate resist∣ance, encreasing by the way, to facilitate the enterprize, his Train of Artillery; which made many persons, for their better safety, to get on Board a Ship, given out to be bound for the West Indies, without any further consideration than carrying their cloths, and such things as were portable, without giving suspition; however the Ship fell not off so secretly, but notice was given to the Fort that Commanded that Port, from which she received three Shot in her Bulk, but without doing any con∣siderable damage. About this time Tyrconnel received other News from France, that several Men of War were preparing at Brest in Britany, to bring him such things as his present occasion required, not with∣out an expectation of the arrival of that Prince, for whose Cause and Interest he pretended to continue in Arms. Which News being spread abroad, the Bells were rung, and the Streets every where swept and covered with Gravel, throughout the City of Dublin, and for want of a better conveniency, he Garrisoned St. Patricks Church; refusing at the same time, though contrary to his former Declaration, that any Gentlemen, being Prote∣stants, should wear Swords. This rigorous proceeding being conjectured the forerunner of worse, if not timely prevented, so much disheartens the Traders, not only in Country Market-Towns, but likewise in Cities and Boroughs, that many of the most considerable Traders either put off or shut up their Shops; and mony is so short amongst the poorer sort, that all their moveables will scarcely purchace a weeks Diet, though as yet Provisions are not arrived at any extraordinary dearness; yet according to the lavish and spoil that is made, it cannot be long expected to continue at so cheap a rate, unless supplies be brought out of other Countries to repair the defect of the King∣dom, &c.
And now Tyrconnel finding the Protestants obstinate against all his Threats, began to cajole them with a soft way of wheedling them into a temper more compliant, as appears by a Paper put out by him and his Council, wherein, for divers considerations, and especially for sparing the Ruine of the Kingdom, which by reason of so great Armies on foot, cannot but be rendred mise∣rable, he in a manner intreats the Protestants to lay down their Arms, and yield Obedience, requiring all Parties to disperse and retire to their respective Habitations, and to forbear to break open Prisons, or assault the Popish Party. Yet a little after he gives them to understand, That he has sent his Lieutenant General Richard Hamilton into the Province of Ʋlster, to reduce them by force; yet declaring at the said time, that the consequence of it cannot but be very fatal to that Coun∣try, and the Inhabitants thereof, and inevitably occasion the to∣tal ruin and destruction of that part of the Kingdom, alledging, That the consideration thereof gave him great disquiet and trou∣ble of mind, that a Country well planted and inhabited, should by the insolency and wickedness of its own Inhabitants, be brought to Ruin and Desolation, which he was willing to pre∣vent, if any spark of Grace was yet remaining in the hearts of his Oppressors; further declaring, That notwithstanding the many Affronts they had put upon the Government, and the seve∣ral Acts of Hostility by them committed, that if they will now submit, and become dutiful Subjects to his Royal Master, mercy shall be extended to them; excepting some Persons, whom he con∣cludes not worthy of it; strictly charging, in the name of him∣self and the Council, all armed Persons in Ʋlster, and the Town of Sligoe forthwith to lay down their Arms; and that the princi∣pal Persons with them in the North do forthwith repair to Lieu∣tenant General Hamilton, and deliver up to him their Arms and serviceable Horses, and give Hostages, as an assurance of their future Loyalty and Obedience; and that all their Adherents do deliver up their Arms and serviceable Horses to such as shall be appointed to receive them by the said Hamilton, and give Hostages for their future peaceable Deportment to himself, or Colonel Mack Donnel at Boyle, promising safe conduct to such as will sub∣mit,
with protection and pardon for all that has been done and passed, unless those excepted; but upon such refusal, he commands all his Forces to fall upon them where-ever they meet them, and to treat them as Rebels and Traytors, (for so his Ex∣cellency is pleased to style them) without considering to whom they are subject, and for what side they stand; by the Law of Na∣tions the right being devolved on England by the Conquest of that Kingdom. But to proceed, he further declares, That to the end the innocent may not suffer for the Crime of the nocent, and the committing of inhumane Acts may be prevented, he charges his Forces upon their March, that they presume not to do any vio∣lence to Women, Children, Aged or Decrepid Men, Labourers, Plowmen, or Tillers of the Ground, or to any other, who in the Commotions demeaned themselves innocently, as not joyning with those in Arms, or were any ways concerned in aiding and assisting them. The Persons by him accepted are, Hugh Earl of Mount Alex∣ander, John Lord Viscount Massereen, Robert Lord Baron of King∣ston, Clotworthy Skevington Esq Son to the Lord Viscount Massa∣reene, Sir Robert Colvil, Sir Arthur Rawdon, Sir John Magil, John Hawkins, Robert Sanderson, and Francis Hamilton, Son to Sir Charles Hamilton. And upon these Noblemen and Gentlemen he charges the incouragement of the Protestants to take up Arms, when however, by all that has yet appeared, they were necessitated so to do in the defence of their Religion, Lives and Estates; but the Earl seems very angry with them, because they would not let all these fall into his hands tamely, and suffer them, without con∣tending, to be at his mercy and disposal. But it seems some of these worthy Persons had experienced his former Civilities, and knew his humour too well to trust him with things of the highest concern, and always the dearest to Mankind. This was given in the Council-Chamber at Dublin the 7th of March, 1688. And Signed A. Tyrone, C. Granard, Lymerick, Bellew, Will. Talbot, Tho. Newcomen, Rich. Hamilton, Fran. Plowden. These Threats or Promises made but a slender Impression in the minds of the Protestants, who kept together, entring into an
Engagement mutually to stand by each other in defence of their Religion, Lives, Liberties, Estates, and the preserving the Eng∣lish interest in the Kingdom; by which means they became not a little formidable to the Papists. For to be the less incumbred, or concerned at accidents or events, many of them, as they found a convenient passage, sent away their Wives and Children for England or Scotland, and going abroad in small Parties, frequent∣ly surprized and brought in Booties taken from Tyrconnel's Soldi∣ers in their returns from ravaging the Country; beating them likewise very frequently out of Gentlemens Houses, which they had taken up for Quarters, or Engarrison'd themselves in; inso∣much that no week passed without some Hostility more or less; which induced Tyrconnel, finding his measures for the most part broken, to call frequent Councils, in one of which, as we re∣ceived it in print, he expressed himself in these words: My Lords, THe necessity of our Affairs at present require your most sedate con∣sideration, when matters of less moment are soon weighed without any great matter of debate. We are not only blamed, but threatned from England, for continuing the Sword in our Hands: And it is De∣clared, That upon our refusal to lay it down, we shall be proceeded a∣gainst as Traytors to that Government. King James, whom we shall ever acknowledge our Royal Master; nor do we think our selves obliged to have any other Monarch over us, has sent us no such Orders; but on the contrary, has laid his Royal Commands upon us to continue our Men in Arms, and use all our industry to increase Discipline, and en∣courage our Soldiery with his Princely Promises to assist us with Men and Arms from France; and not only that, but an assurance of his Royal Presence here, which will so enliven the Hearts of all his Catholick Subjects, that I hope we need not have any apprehensions, but that we shall be able to secure our Religion and Liberties against all Opposers, according to the ancient Custom of this Kingdom. My Lords, In pursuance of these Commands, we have seized the Protestants Effects in this Kingdom for the paying and encouraging our Army, and have given them such liberty of Quartering, and other∣wise, that we are afraid the consequence may prove injurious to us, as
well as the Protestant People, who are fled from their Lands and Houses, and we begin already to believe, that a Famine threatens us: It is our business therefore to considrr of a Fund to maintain our Army; for when Tenants are incapacitated to pay, how can we expect it, until we re∣ceive Supplies from France, which will not be wanting with the first Op∣portunity. There is only one way, which is this, We must borrow from our selves a while to serve the King and the Catholick Cause, that it may return to him and us. My Lords, In the first place, I hope we are all of one mind as to keeping up our Army, notwithstanding the Threats from England. Secondly, We doubt not but all of us have the same value for our Royal Masters Person and Religion, as well as the same Sense of his Misfortunes. Thirdly, The Encouragement we have from France. And Fourthly, Our Royal Masters Commands, and Expectation of seeing him here. Let these things induce you to consider about a present Fund. I have layed the way before you in a former part of my Discourse, and shall not be wanting as to my particular. By this we may see, notwithstanding the spoil they have made by plunder, and their seizing the Estates of such Protestant Gen∣tlemen as are retired, they are reduced to so great a want of Mony, that in this early day, when they are diverted but by a handful of Men, in consideration of the number they have listed, they are at a loss for paying and supporting their Army: And it seems such has been the Spoil, Extravagancy and Riot of these trusty Catholicks, (though in a time of Lent) wherein their Re∣ligion, (I had almost said Superstition) enjoins them to forbear from eating flesh; that a Famine is feared amongst them, even in a Country where Cattle abound to a miracle; which plainly appear'd, when there was no prohibition, by the great numbers transported into England, causing a Complaint of the English, that if it was suffer'd, it would create such a cheapness, that it would extreamly abate the Rents of Pasture-grounds, or the Te∣nants would not be capable of holding them. Their Rivers like∣wise abound with Fish, and especially Salmon, beyond what is seen in any other Country; though 'tis true, the Laziness of the Natives, produces no extraordinary plenty of Corn; from which
we must conclude, as has before been hinted, that they have de∣stroyed the Cattle, especially those that belonged to the Prote∣stants, out of revenge or wantonness, and suffered them to rot on the ground, as the Spaniards, though with more Inhumanity, served thc Natives in the West Indies, whose Lives (when they found the want of their service) they would have redeemed at a great value. And what Supply of Mony can come from France may appear by the necessities of the French King, who has set himself in de∣fiance of all Christendom: Nor can he be but apprehensive of the Storms that threaten his Kingdom from almost all the Quarters of Europe. And the little Credit he has, the following Account will manifest, viz. On the ninth of February, notwithstanding the first denyal, Monsieur Colbert, in the name of the French King, sent to the Bankers of Paris to furnish his Majesty, in order to the carrying on his Wars, with a Million and a half of Livres, for which they should receive extraordinary Interest, and be payed the Princi∣pal before the ensuing Christmas. To which, after mature deliberation, and some debate among themselves, they returned Answer, That they had all the respect, and desire of serving his Majesty that could be possibly conceived, and that there was none of his Subjects so forward and ready to contribute to his Assi∣stance as themselves; yet passionately entreated, that his Majesty would not take it amiss, but revolve in his Princely Consideration, their forwardness of assisting him, and that they had already performed in a manner beyond what they were able, having strain∣ed all their Credits in furnishing him with what they have done; and if now they should be obliged to do more, they must be ne∣cessitated to give over their Bank, and thereby Trade, which is the greatest support of the Nation, must of necessity receive a check and decay, because it would be impossible for them to sa∣tisfie those Bills of Exchange already chargeable upon them; but they must sink under the burden; and all they were capable of doing, amounted to no more, than that, if it so pleased him to assign any part of his Revenue for security, they would make it their business to find out such Monyed Men as might in all proba∣bility
accommode His Majesty; And this was all the Answer he could gain. And now to shew the World, that the Design of the Earl of Tyrconnel, in Assuming or Attempting to Support an Arbitrary Power, is no new Project taken up by chance upon the sudden Emergency, we think it not amiss to insert a Passage taken out of a Letter credibly affirmed to be written by the Earl of Sun∣derland's own hand, and communicated to a Friend in Town since his withdrawing himself; wherein, after it has declared the Intreagues and Resoluteness of the Popish Party at Court, for bringing in the Dispensing Power, and getting a Parliament to their mind, in order to the taking off the Penal Laws and Test, &c. we have these words. My Lord Tyrconnel, says the Letter, has been so Absolute in Ireland, that I (meaning the Earl) never had the Credit of making an Ensign, or keeping one in, nor to preserve some of my Friends; for whom I was much concerned, from the last Oppression and Injustice, though I endeavoured it to the utmost of my Power; but yet with Care and Diligence being upon the place, and he absent, I diverted the calling a Parliament there, which was designed to alter the Acts of Settlement; Chief Ju∣stice Nugent and Baron Rice were sent over, with a Draft of an Act for that purpose, furnished with all the pressing Argu∣ments that could be thought upon, to perswade the King; and I was offered Forty Thousand Pounds for my Concurrence; which I told the King, and shewed him at the same time, the Injustice of what was proposed to him, and the Prejudice it would be to that Country, &c. These were the early Resolutions of the Papists in Ireland, who bore up with hopes of Extirpating the Protestant Religion in that Kingdom, left no Stone unturned, no Design unat∣tempted, that Art or Mony could promote or bring to Perfecti∣on; promising themselves, no doubt, a lasting Tranquility from so great a Harvest of Success and prospect of Gain. Whilst things were at this pass in Ireland, no doubt at the In∣stigation of the Popish Agents, who buzzed strange Notions into their Heads, about 1200 Souldiers, with many of their Officers,
part late the Earl of Dunbarton's Regiment, and part Fuziliers, not only refused to obey their Orders to march, but seizing upon the Mony sent down to pay them, and four Field-pieces, they fell into Mutiny and Disorder; marching away, and plun∣dering the Country for Subsistence, every where seizing the Horses, and using many Outrages: News of this coming to White-hall, the Parliament Addressed the King on the Fifteenth of March, to take a speedy and effectual way of Suppressing them, as likewise to Issue out his Royal Proclamation, De∣claring them and their Adherents Rebels and Traytors, &c. for which His Majesty was Graciously pleased to return them his Thanks; letting them know at the same time, that he had sent a Force of Horse and Dragoons to Suppress the Rebels, and would take effectual care to Issue out his Proclamation as was desired: And accordingly a Proclamation was Issued out, De∣clarig them Rebels and Traytors, commanding all Magistrates and Officers, Civil and Military, to be diligent in Suppressing and Apprehending them. On the Nineteenth of March the King's Forces found the Rebels, or the main Body of them, near Sleeford under Spanny∣hedge, as they came off Bridge-end Causway, in their March for Spalding; who no sooner perceived the Regiment of Dra∣goons, but they cast themselves into a Form in order, having a Hedge on the one side them, and a Water on the other, plant∣ing their Field pieces in the Front of the Circle they made; which the Dragoons discovering, wheeled about with such swiftness to the Rear, that they gave them no time to Trans∣plant their Cannon; and passing all Difficulties, came so furi∣ously upon them, that seeing there was no other Remedy, but that they must expect immediately to be charged, they thought it more safe to beat a Chamade, and thereupon fell to Parly, offering to lay down their Arms, upon condition they might have the King's Pardon: But the Officer commanding in Chief, replying, It was more than he could promise them, and that his Orders were, If they did not forthwith lay down their Arms, he was to reduce them by Force. Upon this they offered to lay down their Arms, if he would promise to endeavour the
obtaining His Majesties Gracious Pardon for them: Which he generously profering, they flung down their Arms and sub∣mitted themselves; whereupon they were carried Prisoners to Faulkingham. And these having sent about Forty of their Com∣panions to Sleeford, to take up Quarters and provide Necessaries for them, Sixty of the King's Dragoons early the next Morning entred the Town, and found them at the Sign of the Angel, where they had been drinking so hard on Free-cost, that, more Resolute than their main Body, though with less Prudence, they provoked the Dragoons to fire upon them, killing a Sergeant and a private Souldier, mortally wounding two others. Two Captains, that had been forward in causing these mis∣guided Soldiers to revolt, made their escapes from Sleeford, up∣on such Horses as first came to their Hands, after whom a Hue and Cry was immediately sent; so that with inconsiderable blood shead, and little trouble, by a foreseen Council, and good Conduct; these Revolters, that had been for some days the ter∣ror of those parts, the people dreading the consequence, were reduced and disposed of in convenient places, in order to their being (at least the Officers) brought to London. And great are the preparations for Ireland, in all parts of this Kingdom, as well of Ammunition, Arms, and Necessaries, there being Com∣missions for raising 10000 Foot, for the Service of that King∣dom. The Colonels such worthy Persons of Fortune and known Conduct, as do's not only hasten the filling the Regi∣ments, but leaves us no ground to doubt the success, viz. The Marquess of Winchester, the Earl of Devonshire, the Lord Kingston, Earl of Roscommon, Drogheda, Viscount Gastleton, Viscount Lisbon, Lord Herbert of Cherbury, Sir Henry Bellasis, Sir Henry Ingolsby, Sir Edward Deering, Levistone Goure Esq and Major Earl. It would be too tedious, in this place, to mention all the Sub-officers, and there being as yet no perfect List made Publick, we may be rendred liable to mistake, wherefore they are omitted. And now the Coasts being narrowly watched, especially the Ports of Chester, Holihead, Beaumoris, Milford Haven, and other Ports that face the Irish Coast, to prevent the escape and
going off of sundry Irish Officers and others that are still lurk∣ing in this Kingdom, for an opportunity to get over and joyn Tyrconnels Forces; and being frustrated on that side, we had a publick Relation, that Ten that have been in considerable Com∣mands, were seized on board a Ship, fallen down to Graves; End, with a considerable quantity of Arms and Ammunition, and that they had purposely taken up the Ship for their passage at an extravagant rate; but by the vigilance of some Persons intrusted, in such like Affairs, they were discover'd and secur'd; being most or all of them Irish Men, and vehemently suspected to be Papists; who upon the rumour that has gone currently abroad of a great Man's Landing in Ireland, where perhaps hasting to prefer their Petitions for Places, before they be all disposed off; but they here found the old Proverb verified, viz. The more hast the worse speed. The Names of these Persons as we find them, are Thomas Burk, late of the Duke of Graftons Regiment, Captain Drum∣mond, Captain Owen Macarty, John Scot, Gilbert Hern, William Garel, Alexander Petre, Garret Parry, and Cornelius Mahan, this is the account, but wavering. Such like matters, after some Re∣ports on the Exchange, and other places, with much confidence and credit of a great Fight in Ireland, between the English and Scotch Protestants, and Irish Papists; we found it grounded up∣on Advice come by a Vessel from Drogheda, in the Kingdom of Ireland, to Liverpool; the Master whereof reports, that the Irish Army being sent down to the North, to Fight the Prote∣stants there in Arms, in the defence of what yet remains un∣spoil'd or destroyed, by the Plunder and Ravage of the Irish; on Wednesday the  of March, a party of Irish Horse and Dragoons, supposed to have been their forlorn Hope, advan∣cing towards Loughbricklan; the Protestants upon notice from the Scouts they had sent abroad, met them before they reached that place, and drawing up in good Order, with much Resolu∣tion and Bravery, gave them a Vigorous onset, which not only made them retire and lose ground, but fall into such dis∣order and confusion that they were no ways capable of recover∣ing their Ranks; yet the Protestants being most Foot, were not
so capable of following them, as their forwardness prompted them to; however the Irish Horse, gauled by their shot and considering themselves no longer able to sustain the shock, they from Retreating fell to open Flight; and finding no place open they in that hurry and confusion, violently pressing on, without regard to their safety, broke through a Battalion of Foot that was to support them; by which they were so far disranked, that when the Protestants came to Charge them, they made but weak resistance, insomuch that Four hundred of them were slain upon the place. This Defeat of the Forlorn or Advance party, Alarumed the main Body; so that they advanced twenty thousand strong on the Friday following, and came up with the Protestants be∣tween Loughbrickham and Hillsborough; and although the latter were much inferior in number, yet, encouraged by their late good Success, they resolved to abide the Battel, and thereupon drew up, facing the Enemy for some time before the Charge was sounded, and then charged upon the Irish with great Cou∣rage and Resolution, as determining in this Encounter, to shew the Papists how much more fit they were to Exercise their Arms in Plundering and Spoiling than in an open Fight; so that the Engagement fell out to be Bloody and Desperate. And further the Master reports, That on the Sunday following, an Express came to Droghedah, he then being at Anchor in the Port, to give notice, that about six thousand of the Irish Papists were killed, though with the loss of no less than four thousand of the Protestants: However, the latter put the former to flight and kept the Field; which successful beginning, if confirmed, will more firmly assure the Protestant Interest than ever, when it is considered they are capable already, before they have received any considerable Assistance from England, to cope with their Enemies the Papists, and wrest from them the Victory, with such considerable Advantage. This Master brought no Passengers over with him, by reason of the Prohibitions of that kind, and the strict Searches that are made in the Ports, not permitting Man, Woman nor Child to leave the Kingdom, by coming off in any of the places where
the Papists have power or command: Adding to what he has related, That the Condition of the poor Protestants is most miserable all about that place, being Plundered and unmerci∣fully Spoiled, even to the Gates of the Town; and not content to take their Goods and Cattel, or the poor Remainder they have left them to subsist, but strip them of their Cloaths, and turn them out to shift; so that many of those miserable misused People, come in a manner Naked into the Town. Nor are those in the Town free from Dreadful Apprehensions of the like Usage. And now, although it may appear somewhat Foreign from what we proposed, it may not however be altogether impro∣per, to speak something relating to Scotland, since in so doing we shall touch upon the Influence, the Irish Papists being in Arms, has given some Persons in that Kingdom, though the underhand Contrivances are not fully manifested, as to what they may tend. On the sixteenth of March, the Convention, according to Appointment, Assembled at Edinburgh, being very full, and the City moreover was filled with People more than in many years before it had been seen. After Prayers, which was said by the Bishop of Edinburgh, the Elections were given in, and amongst them all there were not above twelve Controverted. The first thing they went to, was the chusing a President, when the Duke of Hamilton and Marquess of Athol being set up, the Foreman carried it by many Voices; and then proceeded to elect a Committee of Five out of every State to examine Elections: After which they took the Matter of Edinburgh Castle into their Considera∣tion, which Castle was then commanded by the Duke of Gourdon a Papist, and sent to that Duke, requiring him to put the Castle into their hands: Whereupon he desired an Indemnity for all that was past, and Security for the future; which the Convention condescending to, so far as he had acted as a Papist; They sent the Earls of Tweedale and Lothair to the Duke, with an Indemnity in Writing for himself and all that were with him; whereupon he craved twenty four hours time to consider of it; which being readily granted, at the Expiration
of which, the Earls were again sent to require the Duke of Gourdon to deliver the Castle upon the Terms and Security de∣manded by him, and agreed to by the Convention; but instead of standing to that, he demanded twelve days more to consider of it; and after several Messages sent to and fro, he at last de∣clared, That he would not deliver up the Castle at all. Where∣upon the Convention sent up the Heraulds at Arms, in all their Formalities, to charge him in the Name and Authority of the Convention, immediately to deliver up the Castle upon pain of Treason: And upon his Refusal, the Heraulds went to the Market-Cross, and with the same Solemnity proclaimed the Duke of Gourdon Traytor and Rebel, forbidding all Persons on pain of Treason, to Converse, Correspond or Treat with him, or to Aid, Abet or Succour him, with an intention regularly to proceed to Forfeit him. And upon notice of this, for fear of a Siege, and being reduced by Arms, the Duke thought fit, be∣fore-hand to lay in his Stores of Provision; but such a strict Watch was set over him, that no Privacy could prevent the Discovery and Seizure of several Barrels of Provision that was going to supply him in the Castle. And notwithstanding his Obstinacy against a firm and stedfastly United Kingdom, in which appears so little hopes of Division may tend to, unless his own Ruin, no considerate Person is able to conjecture. That the Convention is resolved to be unshaken in Asserting their Power, has evidently appeared; for an Express Arriving, with a Letter from the King of England to the Convention, and another Letter being likewise brought by one Mr. Crane, signed by the late King James the Second, and Countersigned Melfort, His Majesties Letter was read with great Applause, and a Com∣mittee was appointed to draw up an Answer in the most Thank∣ful and obliging Terms, and Dutiful manner. But before they would admit of the Letter from the Late King James to be opened or read, an Act passed by the almost Unanimous Con∣sent of the House, Asserting and Maintaining the Lawfulness of the Convention, notwithstanding any thing that might be Alledged in the said Letter to the contrary; And Declaring That they would not Dissolve, but continue Sitting until the
Government, Religion, Laws, Liberties and Properties were set∣led and established, which Act was signed by the whole House, except a very few: After which, the Letter was read, which was so far from having the effects some expected, that it rather ser∣ved to make the Convention more unanimous for the setling the Government after the example of England, to which the Peo∣ple of the Kingdom of Scotland are so greatly enclined, that it would be but labour lost, for the Papists to go about to induce them to any thing that may tend to the advantage of the Popish Interest, seeing the Kingdom of Scotland has given early and fa∣mous instances of its detestation against Popery. Nor is it con∣jectured, that the Duke of Gourdon, who would, it seems, shew himself another Tyrconnel in Scotland, has above an hundred men with him; the Castle of Edenborough, we must own is of con∣siderable strength, yet at the same time slenderly provided with necessaries for the support of Life; and where they are wanting, and Famine, (which no Walls nor Fortresses can keep out) gets in, there is not a Saint Red-lettered in the Roman Legend that can fortifie their Patience and Constancy against her Assault. But this may seem too large a digression, and make the Reader desirous that we should keep closer to Ireland, as proposed to be the principal Subject of these Papers. And from thence, though we have received nothing of extrordinary importance, since the report the Master gave of the Fight, &c. Yet those advices that carry the fairest face of credit, continue to fill our ears with dismal Stories of Popish Cruelty; especially in those parts, where, without resistance, Tyrconnel's Forces can exert their Power, and insult over the poor Country Villagers, enfeebled by want, and reduced to a perishing condition: And although the Earl, when too late, touched with a slender Remorse, sent out his Orders to restrain the Insolencies of his Soldiers; yet their long licentious way of living rendred them forgetful what it was to obey, when they were enjoyned any thing of that nature, as perhaps resolving to make the little Hay they have whilst the Sun shines; considering the time grows near, wherein they cannot but expect another sort of Gamesters to deal with than what have hitherto fallen to their share: and it would be in
vain for them once so much as to imagine, or flatter themselves with that golden delusive Dream, That the English will at an easie rate part with their Possessions and Estates in that Kingdom, which with much hazard and danger, Toil, Blood and Treasure, they have purchased to themselves and their Posterity; or that they will ever submit to an Irish Government, where none but Wolves will of consequence be set to look and oversee the Fold. Great indeed was the prudence of our Ancestours in ma∣king wholsom Laws for regulating so stubborn a People, whom no mercies nor favours can reasonably oblige. Yet so far have they been indulged to them, that there remains nothing of hard∣ship or severity towards those that will submit themselves to live regularly, peaceably, and as good Subjects ought; seeing in that consists the happiness and tranquility of a People, and without it all is in confusion and disorder. But here we may suppose our Labour lost, and that we preach to the Wind, when we go about to inculcate morality into the Irish, a Nation so stubborn and inflexible by nature, that although they are confident nothing does more conduce to their Well-being, than the improvement the English make in their Cultivation, Manufacture and Trade; yet without any reason, it has been all along apparent, that they study nothing more than to extirpate and destroy them, continu∣ing the hereditary hatred and rudeness of their Ancestors. And this appear'd in Con O Neal, a considerable Head of a Tribe, who left a solemn Curse upon his Posterity, if ever they sowed Wheat, Speak English, or built Houses. And in this, for the most part, they followed his advice; for any one that travels among the Irish, especially the Villagers, may bless himself to see any thing like a House; and Chimneys are in a manner as scarce as Church-Steeples.
Postscript. ABout this time a Report was spread, that the Late King James was Landed in Ireland; And since a Paper in Print declaring the Manner of his Landing and Reception is come to our hand, out of which take the following Account, viz. On Thursday the Fourteenth of March, the late King being recovered of the Indisposition caused by the Sea, set for Dublin, where he arrived on Saturday following, being the Sixteenth of this Month, being met and received by the Earl of Tyrconnel ten Miles from Dublin, who con∣ducted him thither, having caused all the Forces there to be drawn up at the entrance into the Town, who saluted the late King's Arrival with three Vollies of Shot. The Lord Mayor, Aldermen and Common-Council also met Him in their Formalities: The Streets were lined with the Irish Life-guards even to the Castle-gate, where the late King was conducted and Lodged. The Papist Inhabitants shouting, the Souldiers Musquets discharging, the Bells ringing, and at Night Bonfires in all parts of the Town. The next day being Sunday, there was singing of Te Deum, and Processions for Joy, and a multitude of Masses
said for the Advancement of the Catholick Cause; to the great Terror of all the Disarmed Protestants there and there∣abouts. But upon this at present we lay no great Stress, con∣sidering the various Reports we have heard, &c.
An Account of the LIFE and Memorable ACTIONS OF Father Petre THE JESUIT. BEFORE we enter upon the Life and Actions of a Person, that has of late made such a Noise in the World, leaving to Posterity as great a Fame, as he who burnt Diana's Temple at Ephesus built all of Marble, and then accounted one of the Magnificentest Structures of the World, only to get him a Name, though by so Infamous an Act: It will not be amiss to let you know he is of the Society Founded by Ignatius Loyola, which has been ever Fatal to Kings and Kingdoms, where their Counsels have been hearkned to, and their Interest grown up to any Per∣fection. And because some may be Ignorant who this Ignatius was, we shall lay down a brief Character of him,
as we find it in his Life, written by a Roman hand, and then proceed to Edmund Petre his prosperous Brother. Ignatius Loyola was Born of Obscure Birth in Spain, and when he came of Years, he betook himself to Souldiery; but growing weary of the Hardships endured in Camps, he began to think of setting up an Order, in Imitation of those that had done it before, and found great Profit and Advantage thereby; but appeared so Silly a Fellow, quite different from his Fraternity in these days, that he knew not what to undertake; and so thoughtful he grew thereupon, that at length he seemed as one Distracted, or divided between many Opinions; insomuch, that he would run up and down the Streets in Raving Fits half Naked, sometimes throwing Stones into the Air, at other times looking with his Eyes stedfast and unmovable on the Earth; at other times he would tye or girt his Body about with Cords or Chains, his Flesh swelled, and pretend extraordinary Fasts to Mortifie himself, and seem exceeding Pitiful and Charitable, thereby to raise him some repute. When having, by his Follies and Ex∣travagancies. gotten a Crew of Followers much of the same Humour, He went to Rome and obtained of the Pope, to set up an Order of the Brotherhood or Society of Jesus, so impudently Presumptuous was this Illiterate Enthusiastick, making to himself three Vows, of Poverty, Chastity and Obedience, enjoyning all that should be of that Society, under Pains and Curses to Obedience; but how far they have complied with them, we leave the World to judge. There are several Stories go of him, viz. That when the Devil, as it seems it was his wont, came to disturb him in his Prayers, he Cudgel'd him till he roar'd again; and at such times as he composed
the Constitution of his Society, they tell us a ridiculous Story, viz. That God the Father appeared most Glori∣ously to him, Insinuating by some Mystical Signification, that it would be a thing pleasing to his Divine Majesty, that the Mother of God should offer up her Prayers unto him for him. Whereupon (if you will believe it) the Blessed Virgin suddenly appeared, and recommended this Block-head to the Eternal Father, and demonstrated, that her own Flesh was there present in the Eucharist, in the Flesh of her Son. At another time it is reported in his Life, that both he Father and the Son appeared to him, and then the Holy Spirit; with many such Extra∣vagant Passages, which may rather appear to be the Frenzies of a Mad-man than the Vision of a Saint; for God says Exodus 33.20. There shall no man see my face and live. But to bring Scripture to a Papist, who denies all Scriptures to be the Judge of Controversie, is to sow Corn in the Sea: And of this Ignatius, the Founder of the Jesuits Society or Order, so many Miracles are feigned to be done by him in his Life-time; and after his Death, that we do not read, put all the Apostles together, that theirs come near to the Multitude. But it is sufficient that we know them to be the Lying Wonders of couzen∣ing Priests, to keep up the Reputation of this hopeful Saint. And since we have gone thus far, it now remains that we leave Ignatius as we found him, and take a Survey of the Life and Actions that has even out-run him in a Race of Mischief.
The Life and Actions of Father Petre. EDmund Petre was a Person of so obscure a Birth, that it is doubted by many, whether he himself was ever acquainted with the particular place that gave him his first Birth, though some assign him one place and some another; neither hath the Quality of his Parents come to our knowledge. In his Youth he ap∣peared indeed Active and Studious, insomuch, that be∣ing put to Learning he indifferently profited, and at length being seduced, and growing a kind of a Zealot, and looked upon by some of the Papists as a hopeful Twig, that might in time grow up into a Tree to do them Service; he was encouraged to that degree, as by the Influence of some Persons Interested with the Superiors of the Jesuits, he was entred a Novice in their College, as some confidently affirm it, of St. Omers, others in a College in Spain, where, for a time, he lived, and employed such time as he could spare from Servile labour, to the Study of Politicks, and became such a Proficient, that he was much taken notice of, and often employed abroad in weighty Affairs, till growing into some Repute, he by Insinuation, at which he was excellent, wound himself into the thoughts of very considerable Persons, as having a fair smooth Tongue, and a very affable way of Flattering; and it has been whispered, that he got too great an Advantage over the late King when he was in Flanders in the Spanish Service, and wrought so powerfully upon his
Youthful Years, that the Effects have been since mani∣fested. But of this we have no certainty, and therefore passing it over, it will be convenient to draw a little near these times, that we may the better see the Father in his proper Colours. Father Le Chase having by many Arts and Insinuations wound himself into the Court of France, especially by his pernicious Councils against the Protestants, in whose Ruin and Destruction he has not been a little Instru∣mental; and swelling up Lewis the Fourteenth with thoughts of being Invincible; and making War (as he terms it) for his Glory, though to the Disturbance of all Christendom, and the loss of half a Million of Men, he could find no fitter a Person to support him in his carrying on his Designs, and keeping his Station in the Bosom of the French King, whose Confesser by this time he had been made, than by strengthning his Councils with those of another, that might Project whilst he was putting in Practice or otherways imployed; and upon Search or Inquiry for a fit Person, none found greater Recommendations to him than the Per∣son who occasions the latter Subject of our Discourse, as well for his Sagacity, as his Gravity in years. The two Jesuits soon met, and had a right understand∣ing of what was to be done for the advancement of them∣selves and their Society; the one openly, and the other secretly, by Council and Advice, managing the grand Affairs. But after a while, the secret and underhand con∣trivances of the Papists in England, called for Father Pe∣tre's assistance, as it has since appear'd by some words him∣self
let fall. But as politick as they were, Heaven design∣ing to blast their Councils and Advices, turned their Wis∣dom into Foolishness; for when they suspected the least, in the year 1678. all the projects, they had for many years been laying, were blown up on a suddain; so that this Father, and divers others, not being Martyr proof for the Catholick cause, were forced to fly and conceal them∣selves; some had not so good luck, but being taken re∣ceived the reward of their Treason and Conspiracy they had plotted and made to subvert the Government in Church and State; of which we might instance divers, but it is evidently known it may be fitly waved. The Storm continued with Violence for some time, but by degrees, like a falling Sea, it calmed; which gave se∣veral Priests and Jesuits that were Convicted of High Treason, an Opportunity to escape with their Lives, and encouraged others to come forth of their lurking holes; and amongst others this Father put forth his Meger Face, and found a Protection at St. James's; nor were they Idle that is, out of Mischief, for Note, that a Jesuit is never con∣tentedly employed, if there be nothing of that nature at the bottom of his undertaking: And because the Plots and Horrid Contrivances proved against them, nay, even the whole, as Interested Persons had blackned them to a strange degree, and rendred them Monstrous in the sight of Protestants; they labour to take off the Odium from themselves, by laying it upon the Dissenters, having before vainly tried to take off the Witnesses against them∣selves by Bribes and other means; and although they were often detected, yet in the end this Father's Counsels joyned with others, and the secret Court-Favours that
imboldened and encouraged them to go on, had nearly gained the point, and by a certain Machavilian policy of dividing Protestants, by creating heats and feuds amongst them, upon mistaken grounds, mainly helped them for∣wards with their designs; so that even in the Reign of King Charles the Second they had mainly retrieved them∣selves, and began to appear barefaced with as much con∣fidence as ever, wiping their Mouths with Solomons Harlot, and declaring, They had done no ill, no, so far they went that they brought the Dissenters to disgrace at Court, and were the occasion no doubt that many of them were Fi∣ned, Imprisoned, and more severely Punished; so that since Father Petre has brag'd, That the Jesuits had fooled them at their own Weapons; for indeed the many at∣tempts they had before made might have forewarned the Dissenters from giving the Adversary any opportunity or occasion against them. About the latter end of King Charle's Reign, Petre and others began to elevate their expectations, and no doubt at that time owed their hopes to the heats that remained yet amongst Protestants. And now, as Heaven would have it, that they might yet rise higher, to fall the lower, that good King was taken out of this Life, on the sixth of February 1684. after he had languished of an extraordinary Distemper; whereupon so great was the malice or vain-glory of the Priests, that they not only by word of Mouth declared him to dye a Roman Catholick, but put out sundry papers giving an account how they, and espe∣cially Father Hudlestone, proceeded with him upon his death-bed; and that may rather redound to their shame and impudence than glory, to assault a Prince with Im∣portunities,
and in a manner Violence, when he was worn out with a painful Distemper, sensless and dying. But this is a new piece of Romish Priest-craft, however few Protestants gave credit to any thing they assert∣ed as to this particular; though the better to confirm it, some Papers, said to be the Hand-writing of that King, were by the Art of Hocus gotten into his strong Box, wherein it was pretended he favoured the Romish Reli∣gion; and this for ought we know might be Father Pe∣tre's Master-piece, who about that time was extreamly busie at Court, and made but one small leap to jump into Cabinet Councils, nay the very Bosom of the succeeding King, where the old Snake being warmed with Power and Wealth, began to hiss aloud, and spit his Jesuitick poison, inviting the Locust from distant Lands, and no∣thing less than advising to a dispensing Power was suffici∣ent to work his Wicked and Ambitious designs; for once the Monarchy being Absolute himself doubted not but so to order it as might turn all to the advantage of the Pa∣pists, and little or nothing unless disadvantage and dis∣grace to that of the Protestants; and so enraged he was for having been formerly put to the rout, and recei∣ved some other affronts, that the poor Duke of Monmouth felt his Anger by hastening his death, through his per∣swading a great Lady to Fast, as 'twas strongly reported, till he was Executed; but even inspiring by many Argu∣ments and Perswasions, Malice and Revenge into the Lord Chief Justice, who had before a sufficient compe∣tency of his own which prompted him to a greater ri∣gour than his natural fierceness was induced withal, to∣wards the poor Wretches in the bloody Western Circuit; and who knows but this Father might by his powerful
solicitation obtain for him the Chancellorship, as the re∣ward of that Service done to the Catholick Intrest? However 'tis notoriously known that many Places and Offi∣ces were disposed by his approbation. And so great was the Jesuit grown on a suddain, having his Lodging ap∣pointed him in Whitehall, after the best manner, that his Antechambers were crouded with Petitions, for they found by experience, if he undertook their business it seldom failed to prosper; but then they must be sure not to come empty Hand, for he'd admit none to sue In for∣ma pauperis. This raised the Father to such a pitch of Ambition, that like Hammon, he expected the bowing of Knees as he passed; and such as were in Places of Trust about Court, as did not give him great observance, must be sure to expect a shrewd turn from his Hands when it came in his way to work it; not great Wolsie himself, in the Reign of Henry the VIII. aspired to more Ambiti∣on mingled with Coveteousness; but this will not do un∣less his Authority may more publickly appear; so that we find him in the Council, consulting, as you may believe if you think fit, for the good of a Protestant Kingdom, and here as the old saying is, That the Wolf was set to keep the Sheep; and that no part of the Nation might be igno∣rant of his Exaltation, his Name was Published in a Proclamation or Declaration under the rest of the Privy Counsellors, figuratively representing a Pillar to support the rest, and may be recorded the first time that ever one of his Order sat as a Privy Counsellor of England; and the Father began to stir his stumps, Mandamuses and Quo Warranto's were Order'd to be sent abroad so fast
that the Clerks were tired with writing them: Corporati∣ons and Colleges were disseised of their Charters, Grants and Priviledges, Laws dispensed with, Judges and other Magistrates that would not come up to serve their turn, layed aside, Offices, and almost all Places of Trust given away and disposed of to known Papists; and nothing to be had by those that would not say their Catechism after the Roman way; and because the Church of England would not comply with the Overtures of her Members, who had so long supported the Throne, were every where outed, and not looked upon as worthy to be trusted so much as with a Constable's Staff, or Gauging an Old Wives Ale-tub. The Dissenters were called in to swallow the Pill the Church had refused; and though but a little be∣fore persecuted with Fines, Imprisonment, and Death; now they have Liberty, and caressed in a high manner. These things plainly demonstrated, that Father Petre the Jesuit was Steers-man, sailing with the Ship of Govern∣ment directly to Rome. But the Tests and Penal Laws stood up as a Rock in the way, so that Pioneers were in∣stantly sought to remove them: But no sufficient number found, the old Jesuit was angry; and perceiving the Church of England crossed his purpose, it was resolved that a Test should be put upon her Clergy in reading the Declaration for Liberty of Conscience in time of Divine Service; and for non-compliance, the 7 Bishops were im∣prisoned, and afterward Tryed, but Acquitted themselves like Worthy Prelates armed with Courage and Innocen∣cy, which so enlightned the Eyes of the Nation, that Fa∣ther Petre found all his measures broken, which he had been many years tacking together with Golden Thred; and thereupon biting his Thumbs, from that day forward
he began to presage the downfal of Babel: And indeed he had so far overshot himself, that it was not in his pow∣er to retrieve it: Nor did he after that much pore upon Politicks, but rather made it his business to scrape all the Mony he could together against a rainy Day, which he fancied was at hand; consulting how he might the most conveniently be packing upon occasion; though in the heighth of his expectations, he had declared, nothing lay more heavy upon his Conscience, than that he had shame∣fully deserted the Catholick Cause, when the Churches Flock, as he termed them, together with their Shepherds, were persecuted in England, wishing that he had stayed and suffered even death it self with those that suffered: But it seems this was only out of a Bravado, to draw Tears out of the eyes of some of the Converts: For it plainly appears, the Father had no Stomach to it this se∣cond bout, when he might easily have had his wish, by staying a few days longer than he did: but hearing the Forces were advancing apace towards London, and fear∣ing too late a Retreat, he packed up his Awls, having scraped together, as is credibly reported, Fifty thousand Guinea's; but with what honesty, I leave to the dis∣cretion of the Reader to conjecture: But as for the manner of his going, we are as yet, though some say he went off with the late Queen; others, that he went a considerable time before; but we have not heard from any hand, that he has been since seen in the Court of France, which makes many conclude, That he either is gone to Rome with the Popes Nuntio, to giv his Holiness an account of his Proceeding: Or on the other hand, is still lurking in England in Disguise.
Thus Father Petre that wou'd stem the tide, And on a Kingdoms back in triumph ride; Striving to guide her with a Roman Bit, She winch'd and overthrew the Jesuit. FINIS.
