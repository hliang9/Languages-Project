And vpon the same suruey to obserue what numbers of Armes, Armours, Gunnes, Pikes, and Bandaliers were wholly wanting, as aforesaid, that are appointed and ought to bee charged vpon any person, or persons, in any place, and to distinguish the vtterly vn∣seruiceable from such as by mending, and repaying, might bee made seruiceable, and to set downe the numbers and natures of the defects, and to make vp the said Suruay in a Booke, vnder the hands of Our said Commissioners, or any one, two, three or more of them, to bee signed, and approoued of by the Lord Lieutenant, or Deputy Lieutenants, or such as they in euery place shall depute for that purpose, to assist in the said Suruay: And likewise vpon such their Suruay to approoue of all such Armes, of the Common Armes and Trayned Band as should bee found fit for seruice, and to prooue and try all sorts of Gunnes, Pikes, and Bandaliers of the said Common Armes, and Trayned Band before they bee vsed, or exercised, and to approoue of such as should bee seruiceable for warres, at the Owners charge, and being prooued, should allow as fit for seruice, and allowing should Stampe the same with the A. and the Crowne, being the Hall Marke of the Company of workemen Ar∣mourers of London, which Marke or Stampe shall (with the consent of the Lord Lieute∣nant or his Deputy Lieutenants) remaine in their custody who shall haue the charge to bee entrusted with the execution of this Seruice: wherein, and in Our said whole Commissi∣on, they are futher to follow such Iustructions as are, or shall bee giuen foorth from Vs, or the Lords of Our Priuie Councell, or Councell of warre in that behalfe. And to the end no abuse, or deceit might bee in the number of Armes, Armours, Gunnes, Pikes, or Bandaliers borrowed one of another, wee did by the said Commission, giue Our said Commissioners, or the Maior part of them, their Deputies, or Assignes, power and au∣thority, to cause to bee framed, and made, and to vse, two other Markes or Stampes, to be first allowed by the Lords Lieutenants, or Deputy Lieutenants, or such as they should de∣pute

And that vpon the entreatie of Our said Commissioners, their Deputies or Assignes (accor∣ding as the wants and defects of the said Armours, Gunnes, Pikes, and Bandiliers, should ap∣peare vpon the said Booke of Suruay signed as aforesaid, Our said Lords Lieutenants and their Deputy Lieutenants of the seuerall Counties respectiuely in Our name should command and giue order to the seuerall places and persons chargeable therewith, within a reasonable time, and at some conuenient place, to be prescribed to supply such defects, either by prouiding new Ar∣mours Gunnes, Pikes and Bandiliers, or by mending and repayring the old, as there should be cause. And to the end no excesse of Prices may either through necessitie or ignorance bee put vpon the Countrey for new Armours, Gunnes, Pikes, or Bandiliers; or for the dressing, repayring, prouing and stamping the old and seruiceable, wee did by Our Commission require and com∣mand, That no Armourer, Gun-maker, Pike-maker, or Bandalier-maker, who should bee im∣ployed in this Seruice, should demand, take or receiue for any new Armours, Gunnes, Pikes or Bandaliers, for dressing, repayring, proouing or stamping the old, or any part of them aboue the rates and prices in the aforesaid Schedule expressed. And wee did also by Our said Commission, will, require and command, all persons charged with Armes, Armours, Gunnes, Pikes or Bandaliers of the common Armes, or the Trayned Band, that should then after haue of Our said Commissioners, their Deputies or Assignes any new Armours, Guns, Pikes or Bandaliers, or should haue any Armours Guns, Pikes or Ban∣daliers, dressed, amended, repayred, proued or stamped by them or any of them, That they vpon such hauing or receiuing from them any such new Armours, Gunnes, Pikes, or Bandaliers; or vpon their hauing of their Armours, Gunnes, Pikes, or Bandaliers, or any of them dressed, amended, altered, repayred, proued, or stamped, as aforesaid; should satisfie, content and pay Our said Commissioners, their Deputies or Assignes, or any of them for the same, according to the Rates & Prices in the foresaid Schedule expressed and set down: And if any difference at any time should arise touching the natures or numbers of defects, betweene the Armourers, Gun-makers, Pike-makers and Bandalier-makers imployed for the said new making, mending, dressing, repay∣ring, prouing and stamping of any of the Armours, Gunnes, Pikes, or Bandaliers, of the com∣mon Armes or Trayned Band aforesaid, and those in whole custody the said Armours, Gunnes, Pikes or Bandaliers should be or remaine, That the same should be ordered by the Lords Lieu∣tenants, or Deputie Lieutenants, or any of them, or such as should be by them or any one of them deputed for the time being, who should take the Suruey about mentioned, as by Our said
Commission amongst diuers prohibitions, and other things therein contained, more at large it doth and may appeare. Now to the end all Our louing Subiects may take knowledge what wee command ro forbid to be done in this so important and necessary Seruice for the generall good of this Our King∣dome, and that Our people may not plead ignorance, wee doe hereby will, require and com∣mand all and singular Our Lieutenants, deputy Lieutenants, Iustices of Peace, Maiors, She∣riffes, Muster-masters, Captaines of Bands, and their Lieutenants, high Constables, Consta∣bles, Headboroughes, and other Our Officers, Ministers, and louing Subiects, That they and euery of them be from time to time aiding, helping, and assisting vnto Our said Commissioners, their Deputies, Assistants, and Assignes, and to such others, as shall bee by them, or any of them employed in the execution of the same Our Commission or the Seruice thereby required and in∣tended in all things, as shall be most meet, and to performe what to them or any of them respec∣tiuely shal appertaine according to Our pleasure herein, and by Our said Commission declared. And because wee are credibly giuen to vnderstand, that the often and continuall altering and changing of the fashion of Armes and Armours (some Countreys and parts of this Kingdome hauing Armours of one fashion, some of another) doe put many of Our louing Subiects to a great and vnnecessary charge and more then need requireth: For the auoding whereof, Our will and pleasure is, And we doe hereby appoint and command, That hereafter there shalbe but one vniforme fashion of Armours of the said common and Trained Bands throughout Our said Kingdome of England, and Dominion of Wales, when as any of the said Armours shall be supplied and new made, And that, that forme and fashion of Armour shall be agreeable to the last and moderne fashion lately set downe and appointed to be vsed by the Lords and others of Our Councell at warre. The paternes whereof are now and shall remaine in the Office of Our Ordinance from time to time; which is Our pleasure likewise concerning Gunnes, Pikes, and Bandaliers: whereof Paternes are and shall remaine from time to time in Our said Office. And Our will and pleasure also is, That (for the better completing of euery of the Musketiers of Our said trained Band, and that they may be better fitted and appointed for Seruice (if need require) euery Musketier of the common and Trained Band, shall haue, and bee from time to time furnished and prouided of an head piece, agreeable to the moderne fashion of the head∣pieces of the Footmans Armour, whereof the paterne remaineth also in Our foresaid Office of Ordinance. And whereas we are likewise credibly informed, That diuers Linkers, Cutlers and Smiths, and other Botchers of Armes, by their vnskilfulnesse haue utterly spoiled many Armes, Ar∣mours and Gunnes (which by a skilfull workeman might haue beene altered, dressed, amended, and made seruiceable) and yet haue required great rates of the Countrey for doing thereof, and diuers Tradesmen of other Trades and Mysteries, doe buy, barter and sell Armes, Armous, Gunnes, Pikes and Bandaliers, which are bad and insufficient, to the great preiudice of Our lo∣uing Subiects, the same also not being agreeable to the Lawes and Statutes of this Realme. Wee doe therefore hereby straightly charge and command, prohibite and absolutely forbid, That no person or persons whatsoeuer (not hauing serued seuen yeeres, or beene brought vp as an Appreutice or Apprentices in the Trade or Mystery of an Armourer, Gunn-maker, Pike∣makers, and Bandalier-maker, and thereat serued their time of seuen yeeres (other then the
said Commisioners, their Assignes, Deputies, Factors, or seruants, or such as they shall allow of, and employ, and shall bee bound to doe Vs such Seruice, when they shall bee thereunto requi∣red, and haue his Name and dwelling place entered by Our said Commissioners, or some of them by their recommendation, in the Office of Our Ordinance, as aforesaid) doe make, mend, alter, change, dresse, repaire, prooue, or stampe any Armes, Armours, Gunnes, Pikes, or Bandaliers of the Common Armes, or Trayned Band whatsoeuer, or any others, or any of them, or any part of them, or intermeddle therein. Neuerthelesse, it is Our will and Pleasure, And we doe hereby straightly charge, Command, and declare, That Our said Commissioners giue encouragement, and respect, vnto all such Skilfull and well-deseruing workemen, of all sorts of Armes as they shall finde in euery place, or part, within this Our Kingdome, and Dominion aforesaid, to haue them employed, and set on worke. And it is Our will and Pleasure, That if Our said Commissioners shall not bee present, either by themselues, their seruants, deputies, or assignes in euery County and place, when, and where any defects in Armes, Gunnes, Pikes, and Bandaliers at Musters or other such publike meetings in each County shall bee found: Or if Our said Commissioners, or any from, or vnder them, beeing so present in any County, and Place, shall bee vnwilling, and negligent to make, amend, dresse, repaire, and stampe the said Armes, Gunnes, Pikes, and Bandaliers ac∣cording to the intent to Our said Commission, and these presents. Then it shall be lawfull in such their negligence, and default, at such time, or times, and in such cases onely for the said Owners of Armes to carry their Armours, Gunnes, Pikes, and Bande∣liers vnto such Countrey workeman beeing skilfull in their Trade, as heretofore haue made, or amended any of them, to amend, and repaire them as heretofore they haue done, without any trouble, or interruption of Our said Commissioners, or any for, or vnder them, Any thing in these presents, or in Our said Commission to the contrary, notwithstanding. And wee doe hereby also absolutely forbid, That no Ironmonger, Cutler, Chaundler or other per∣sou whatsoeuer, doe from hencefoorth Went, or Sell any Armes, Armours, Gunnes, Pikes, or Bandaliers, or any part of them, but such as shall bee prooued, and stamped with the said Hall Marke of the Company of workemen Armourers aforesaid, beeing the proofe Marke, and also warranted by Our said Commisioners, or some of them, or such as they shall appoint thereunto, and be allowed by them to be sufficient, vpon paine and penalty of Our high indignation, and dis∣pleasure, and such other penalties, and imprisionments, as by the Lawes of this Realme, or by Our Prerogatiue Royall may be inflicted vpon them, for such their Offences and contempts. Giuen at Our Court at Greenwich, The thirtieth day of Iune, in the seuenth yeere of Our Reigne. God saue the King. ¶ Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most Excellent MAIESTIE: and by the Assignes of Iohn Bill, M.DC.XXXI.
