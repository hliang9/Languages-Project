THE PARLIAMENTS Love and Loyalty TO THE KINGS Most Excellent Majestie. Wherein is proved, that the Par∣liaments difcontent, and the Kings disaffection to∣wards them, is the effect of Evill Councellors, that seeke the ruine and destruction of the Kingdom. With some Additionall Reasons, Declaring what hath caused This Seperation of the Kings Majestie from London, And to raise Arms at York. WITH The occasion of these distracted Times, some standing for the King, and some for the Parlia∣ment, as if they desired Civill Wars as the Malig∣nant party doth. London, Printed for Thomas Cook, August 30. 1642.
The Parliaments LOVE and LOYALTY TO THE KINGS MAJESTIE. WHereas the Kings Majestie hath been plea∣sed to imagine and conceive by the insti∣gation of evill effected men, that the Par∣liament endeavours to impaire and give narrower limmits to the Kings Majesties Fame and Honour, and to derogate any thing from the true and Legall Prerogative inherent and essenti∣all in the Kings Person. It may be evidently observed in the many Loving and Loyall Declarations set forth by the Parliament, that they desire nothing more earnestly then to the utmost of their Lives and For∣tunes, to promote the magnificent Honour and Glo∣ry
of His Majestie, to preserve the Protestant Religi∣on, and to s it in such a true and uprg posture of reformation, that the King may still merit as He doth inherit the title of veri Defensor fidei, the Defendor of the true fah, and His Majestie doth herein  and comply with His Honourable Parliament, that He will maintaine and defend the true Protestant Religion. Whereas the Parliament knowes there can be no good Religion in such as raise Arms, and disquier the State of their native Soveraigne, contradicting their oath, bond, and obligation of their faith, whereunto they are sworne by their Allegiance, if such Arms and For∣ces be raised against the Kings Majestie, whose Per∣son they ought to defend against all dangers, both For∣raine and Domestick, yet there may be some additio∣nall reasons whereby in case of necessity, when rumors and feares of invading from the Kings party are feared and spread abroad, when there is an oposition, or an Antiparliament, established to contradict the pro∣cedings of the other, when the Libertie and Priviled∣ges of Parliaments, which ought to be preserved en∣tire, are took away, or slighted, not by distinctions, but absolute negations of their fundamentall being, where divers Members of the House of Parliament do ab∣sent themselves, and not return again upon Summons, nor fine imposed on them for their cōtempt and breach of Parliamentary Power, and when they Kings Maje∣stie seduced by evill councellors of the malignant par∣ty, is instigated to raise copious and informidable for∣ces upon groundlesse feares and jealousies, the Parlia∣ment considering those and other pretended reasons,
and being strong testimoniall witnesses in their consci∣ences of their clear intents and loyall affections to His Majestie cannot chuse but be admonished by the Kings Majesties great preparations, to imagine that when their neighbours house is on fire, their own is in great perill and danger, especially His majestie having of late through the advice of some Incendaries and those that would laugh to see the Cittie of London on fire, as they have themselves reported, strongly besieged and environed the own of Hull, entending to take it by starving them out, blocking up the passages for sup∣plying them wlth any relief or sustenance. The Par∣liament therefore and the Citie of London concurring in mutuall affection, foreseeing the storms that threat∣ens them, hanging in the Northorn Clouds, do intend to raise forces to deffend the Kings Honour, and the safety of the Parliament which desires no War, but the Peace and happinesse of the Kingdom, the preser∣vation of the Laws in their power and authority, the maintaining of Religion free from superstitious In∣novations, and that no errors of Popery and Arianisme may be imposed upon us, as the Doctrine of the Church; The conservation of the Rights and Liber∣ties of the Subject, so that all true-hearted Subjects cannot chuse but have a sensible feeling of the wrongs, indignities, and affronts, offered by the malignant par∣unto the Parliament; And since they are Patres Pa∣triae, the fathers of their Country, the Subjects of En∣gland ought like obedient children to maintain their Rights, and be subiect to all their just and legall com∣mands; how unjustly therefore doth that scandalous Declaration and Resolution of the County of Here∣ford
charge them with insuating false - hoods, and doth feare to intimate that the Body politick of this Kingdom, hath been rather wrong'd in the health thereof, then any way purg'd by the State Physitians of Parliament, being themselves corrupted with sini∣ster respects as the foresaid Declaration falsly mentions. But yet it may be objected what may be the reasons that move the King to keep such a distance from His Loving and Loyall Parliament, and to confide more in Evill Councellors at York, then in His great Coun∣cell of Parliament at London; for a generall satisfacti∣these reasons may be alledged. First, His Majesties opposition against the Parlia∣ment, and by a strong hand supporting and protecting Delinquents, so that orders of Parliament are not o∣beyed but slighted and scorn'd, so that it is made but Imago Parliamenti, a meer shaddow; and this is one cause why the Kings Majesty and the Parliament have so long dissented and disagreed. The second reason may be drawn from the feare and conscientious guiltinesse of some great Persons, who being doubtfull and timerous least the Parliament should discover their Machivilian intentions against the peace of the Kingdom, and secretly adhering to Pa∣pists, do therefore strive to incense the King against the Parliament, and set the Kings Name and Preroga∣tive in the Front of the Battell to defend their own bad causes, and keep them from that punishment which they have incurr'd by their demerits. A third reason is because there is not that mutuall relation and confidence, which ought to be between them, for the medium or meane conjunctive being ta∣ken
away, or frequently broken, or to speak plainly, when the King doth not love and respect His Parlia∣ment, but is by Evill Councell wrought to oppose them, and to suffer them to be maligned with bitter In∣vectives under his name in the forme of Doctors, it must needs consequently disanimate the Parliament, to see their love and loyalty rewarded with nothing but contempt and dislike; what son can shew any iliall duty if the father will not endure his fight but rejects him? what souldier can perform any remarkable service if their Captain do not esteem them as his friends, and confide in them as fidelious and true to their colours and how can the Parliament produce those good ef∣fects which are expected, and accomplish those seri∣ous services and businesses, wherewith their country had entrusted them, if so be that the King give no en∣couragement to their consultations, but hath gathered force at York, under the pretence of a Guard to oppose the Parliament, and besiege Hull; so that while His Majesties love is alienated and withdrawn from His Parliament, and His actions speak contrary to His words, there must needs be jealousies and disagreement betwixt them. A fourth Reason may be the constant and long con∣tinued habit of disaffection; which being like unhappy seeds sow'd abroad among the common people, hath brought a mutinous faction in their distracted minde, some dividing their opinions for the King, and others for the Parliament; so that they have discours'd them∣selves into a supposition and expectance of War, not as the Malignant party hopes to be reconciled; and this is a great reason why the Devil has brought in this
Sophistry, to disjoyn the King and Parliament, to the ubversion of this Kingdom, an effect of the evill Coun∣cells now prevailing and rending to the dissolution of this Parliament, and the disturbance of the Kingdom, This Parliament the hope and preserver of the Prote∣stant Religion, and of the good and welfare of three Kingdoms▪ The blows of friends are unkind, and therefore let us pray that God in these distracted times would change the Kings mind, in whose hands the hearts of Princes are as conformable as wax, and that he would give the Parliament his assistance, whose offence can be no other in the opinion of all true Subjects, but their Love and Loyallty to the Kings Majestie: For, Regis ad examplum totis componitur vrbis. If that the King be pleas'd Wars to make, Subjects by His example Arms must take. FINIS.
