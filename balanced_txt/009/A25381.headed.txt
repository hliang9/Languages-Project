thou maist quietly passe tho∣row the gates of death, there is neither disquieting with sorrow for sinne, nor with sin, which is beyond all sorrow; thou art there without the reach of thine adversary. Whilst thou wast mine, thou wast a wandring, faithlesse, se∣cure, carnall, and impenitent heart, (alwayes infected with the poyson of sin,) but being now thy Creators, hee will apparrell thee anew, adorning thee with the gifts of his Spi∣rit, that being here clothed with the ornaments of his grace, thou maist bee trans∣planted unto the Kingdome of glory, Vnto the which place, the Lord of his mercy bring me, through the mirits of his Sonne, my Lord and Saviour Iesus Christ: To whom with the Father and the holy Ghost,
he rendred all honour and glo∣ry, power and praise, might, Majestie, dignity, and domi∣nion, both now and evermore, Amen. In this prayer I doe from the bottome of my heart, with all humility confesse my sinnes unto my Lord and Sa∣viour Jesus Christ, most en∣tirely desiring him in his mercy, to give me his grace to returne unto him by spee∣dy repentance. O Iesus Christ my sweet Saviour, thou Sonne of God, which art most holy and most mercifull, have mer∣cie on me O Lord, for pity heare my prayers, and grant me petitions: I am a misera∣ble
and most wretched sinner, which from the crowne of mine head unto the sole of my foot, have no soundnesse in me, but wounds, blaines, and pu∣trifying sores of sinne, which deserve thy wrath and indig∣nation against me: but sweet Lord, have compassion upon me, and anoint my wounds with thine oyle of mercy. O Lord, I come with a mourning heart, and weeping eyes, with my most earnest repentance, Oh reconcile my poore, woun∣ded, and distressed soule slaine with sinne, unto thee, O Lord my God, upon the multitude of thy mercies, and with a contrite heart, with all humility, even with sighes, groanes, and tears, most lamentably bewaile my sinnes, and openly confesse them unto thee O sweet Iesus to be more in number then the hairs
of mine head, or sands in the Sea. Yet O my most merci∣full Saviour, I beseech thee forgive me, O Lord forgive me, and give me grace to re∣turne unto thee by speedy repentance, which God grant me. FINIS.
