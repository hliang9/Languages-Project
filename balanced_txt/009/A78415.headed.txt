A CAVEAT FOR KNAVES. You pearlesse Peeres, that sit in Parliament, as many of you as have Traitors been, Beware least that too late you do repent your unjust dealings with your soveraign King. Let all of you upon your knees fall down, and re-inthrone him with his Princely Crown; So may you gaine free pardon for your lives, and live in peace, whence plenty will arise. Printed in the Yeare, 1648.
A CAVEAT FOR KNAVES: THere hath been an old saying of a great while since, that the World runs upon wheels, which were it true, then every spoke (as we call it) would have his part, and bear his part; but I beleeve that it rather runnes like a Crab, al upon one side, as it hath done the time of an Ap∣prentiship with the Parliament; and now Sir is not the Par∣liament the world, or is the Independent Army, that hath of a long time over-aw'd and tutor'd the Parliament, the world; or is Mrs. London that hath by her stretched out Purse to main∣taine them both, the world; as for my part, if you will have my opinion, they are all as one, they are joynt partners in the world, and cannot be severed, but as one body they carry on this wicked world at their pleasure, and not one body alone, but three bodyes, and as they are three bodyes, yet there is but one head, that is, the Head Parliament, why yes there is the
head Army too, I and the head London purse too, and what can either of them do one without the other? for whatsoever the head Purse doth, or what the head Army, although a holy sanctified saintly one, doth do, or pretend to have done, will come to nothing without the head Parliament concur, and by her Vote or Ordinance make good: and so I conclude that the Parliament is the head, purse London the bit or naffle in the mouth of the same head, and the Army the raines to governe that head, and so there is no other now visible head to governe this wicked Kingdom, but these three in one head. And I truly for my part must confesse that this wicked Kingdom hath bin too long, and too much governed by this triple headed Hidron or in plainer tearms, this three headed monster, for in my smal judgement, there are none but monsters that will run on head∣long in wickednesse, and never look beck unto the great God who should be all our heads, nor unto their King, who imme∣diately under God should be our chiefe head, or unto their old head the true long profest Protestant Religion, which so long time hath flourished in England: But now alasse this head Par∣liament is broken, their wicked ulcers of Rebellion and extor∣tion, stink in the nostrils of men and there is no balm in Gilead to be administred unto them, nor no plaister, but his Majesties royall Pardon to cure this broken head; then unto him that we have so rebelled against, and have most offended, and most in∣juriously wronged, let us now fly for succour, and instead of ropes about our necks, present repentent sorrow in our hearts, crave pardon for our lives, and hazzard the losse of our estates, (which if wee do) it will be greater mercy and favour than ever we deserved, having not shown neither to him nor his the like favour, but he is mercifull, his mercy will exceed our inhumane cruelty: But stay, let us first see how far our power will stretch, and our purse and perswasions of our party will serve to pleasure us, and to continue warre a little longer, and maintain our Kingly places, let us continue, blinding the king∣dom as long as we are able, with dallience and delayes, sue for Petitioners in private, and then answer them and all other at
our own pleasure, put them off with the accustomed phrase of rendring them thanks for their continuall respect towards the houses, and tell them we are using al waies and means we can for the setling of a safe, and wel-grounded Peace; or satisfie them as we did the Commanders of the rained-bands of Lon∣don, that we will heare what the Common-Councell saieth in their behalfe, and whether they are of the same mind; and then if they be, we wil speedily give you an Answer at our owne leasure: but first let us see how we shall be secured by them, to sit safe in our Kingly places, and also under pretence of caring for the King, let us require from them the safety of his Maje∣sties person in London, and that there may be a visible way pre∣scribed for it, and then wee wil consider of a way to send for him: and in the mean space we shal see what our juggling Me∣phostapholisses wil doe for us, our flying spirits that we have employed both a broad and at home, how they will prevaile in their perswations, and what forces may be raised for our safety, and desending of our evill cause, we are sure that the Independent party will rise for us both abroad and at home, for they are as deeply concerned in the danger as our selves, and if Purse London wil be brought to continue our freind st, wee may chance to continue our Kingly power; we have to this purpose made an Ordinance already, giving powes uo Major Generall Skipton, to use what meanes hee may to raise what forces he can in and about London, to sudue the Royall party hereabouts, or as many of them as he can ctch,  to kill, hang, or murther them at his pleasue not asking the Lord leave, nor use any mercy at all: and indeed  no great marvaile that you should now continue merciless  practised nothing but crulty so long a time; but  the word of God, do as thu wilt be doe unto and it  then remember the old Proverb, harm watch, ha  look what you have done, will be done to you  though you be three heads yet (and great  ber whose heads you are, and unto whom  heads, and must give an account, and if you be not
then see your own errours, see with a judicious eye, the wo∣full miseries that you have brought this poor Kingdome unto already, and the miserable conditions that this poor distressed Kingdom is like to fall into, by your overswaying, unlimited powers, nay if you will ever take warning, and looke about you, now is the time, take heed, beware of a relapse, for if you persist, you are gone, therefore dally no longer, send for His Majesty without delay, provide for him with honour, free∣dom and safety, grant him his desires, let him have his owne guard, and his own attendents, freely without compulsion, let him treate with you face to face, or with as many of you as dare to look him in the face: do you not see the eminent dan∣ger that you are in? do you not see destruction before your face? your own houses devided, nay some of your housholds devided one against another, the Kingdome in generall risen up against you, all Christian Princes deriding you, the Sea∣men scorning to do you any more service, Purse London sha∣king you off by degrees, refusing to disgorge any more bags to support you any longer, London Trained-bands ready to for∣sake you, your deare brethren the Scots ready to devoure you, for falsifying your Oath to your King, your Covenant with them and the two Kingdomes, and the severe judgement of God, threatning ruin and destruction for your damnable de∣villish dealings, upon this most miserable kingdome; and if none of these will prevaile, then looke unto the handy-worke of the Lord, in raising such suddain and unexpected Armies in his Majesties behalfe, the unthought of store of Arms and Am∣munition, the multitude of Garrisons taken and rendred up for the Kings Royal Majesties use, the multitude of Shipping, the fortunate successes that his Majesties smal forces have con∣tinunally had, if truth might bee believed, and right take place, which will be hard for to make the world to believe, they have been so long blinded with lyes, however it is now visible to us here, by the multitude of your maimed Souldiers that are brought into the Hospitals in London, that there hath been many of your Saints cut off, your invincible Army is
much weakned, your Saints are amazed, your wounded men curse ye, and vow that were they as well as ever they were they would never serve you, your sound men wish that they had but half their Arreares, they would curse you to your face, and tell you that you are but blind guides, and have been the ruinning of many a soul; and if your freinds reward you thus, what shall you exspect from those that you call your enemies? and at the latter daies what may you exspect from the just se∣vere God? But you are Saints, whether God will or not, and you will make the world believe that God gives you a daily blessing, or else your intelligence lyeth, with great Victories, Langdale hee is totally routed, and the party that was in Lin∣colnshire for the King clean disperst, not two to be seen toge∣ther, ask Walkers imperfect Occurrence else, and he shall make al the world to believe it, the Scots too they are so far together by the eares themselves, that they cannot come in against us, have not we Letters daily to that effect? Yes I must needs confesse that you have Letters as from thence, although made in the Inner-Temple; for I will justify that one Gentleman there made three Letters himselfe in one day, and they must come from Scotland: and are not all these routing Letters of the same stamp? how can there be 4000 Souldiers spared out of Lancashire to recruite Lambert? when it is not able to with∣stand the Lord of Darbies forces that is now there: and what County is there in England now, that you may spare any out, or that is able to defend themselves? and for believing expe∣rience look here at home into every county about you, and you shall plainly see the good affection of them unto their King, and so by these you may plainly discern the rest; they are not meane men that are the Leaders of them neither, as yours are, Brewers, Shoomakers, Tailors, Weavers, Tinkers, Coblers, but they are Dukes, Earles, Lords, Knights, Gentlemen, and Commanders most of them, and as soon as ever tht the Prince is once seen to set foot in England, how many thousands more in England will there then appeare and rise against you? ô yee of little faith, it is not the Independent Army, nor the so many
thousand hands that you have presented unto you to have no King, nor no Personall Treaty, that can defend you, nor all the Devils in hell to boot to help you, if the Lord but once lift up his hand against you, as you may now apparently see he begins to doe, by stirring up the hearts of all the Country against, and for every thousand of Independents that stick unto you, you will have five thousand of good Christians against you, and therefore repent and amend, least it bee too late, and the Devill teare you in pieces. FINIS.
