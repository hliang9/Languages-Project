THE TRUE COPIE OF A LETTER FROM Mr Ashburnham, TO A FRIEND, Concerning his Deportment towards the KING in his late Attendance upon His Majesties Person at Hampton-Court, and the Isle of VVight. Printed in the Yeer 1648.
The Copy of a Letter from Mr. Ashburn∣ham, to a Friend, &c. SIR, I Have withheld this return too long; of which I am by so much the more ashamed, by how much I found yours so full of kindnesse: I will pretend to no excuse; but if your good nature will suggest, that the deep sense of my afflictions doth so oppresse my spirits, as it renders me altogether indisposed to the least intercourse, you will be charitable, and take me right. Would you beleeve, that to my sorrows for the sufferings of our deer Master the King, and the danger of the Publick, the generality of men in this Kingdom (and probably in many other parts too) should charge mee with the scandal of having betrayed His Majestie into the Isle of Wight, and that by compact with the Parliament and Army, before his departure from Hampton Court? And to obtain belief the better, have digested that their calumny into this form; That I did conspire with them to affright His Majestie away from thence, that they might have the better opportunity (being at a greater distance from London) to destroy him; which to effect, the neernesse of that place made it very difficult, if not impossible: and that my reward for this service hath been a great sum of money? Thus from severall hands. Which reproach, though I never deserved, and take my self to be very much above any thing of that kinde; yet since there is no person ambitious to acquire or preserve an honest reputation, but is awake, and alwayes carryes about him a tendernesse to the least prejudice or
diminution thereof; I cannot but be touched with some sense of that unhappy report, and give you (in whose good esteem I am much con∣cerned) the true state of my part in that action, so far as may enable you to satisfie (if you meet with him) the most malicious person a∣gainst me. That I was commanded by their Majesties and the Prince his High∣nesse to return into England, with Instructions to endeavour by the best means imaginable, such a compliance between His Majesty and the Army, as might have influence, and beget a right understanding between His Majestie and the Parliament, is a truth well known. That my infirmities are so great, and so publick, as that it had been better for their-service to have given that imployment to some other of more e∣minent endowments, I do acknowledge with great humility: But that I did fulfill that Trust with all industry and fidelity to their Maje∣sties, I appeal to God and them, and do not doubt but I have my portion of favour, and stand still numbred in the Catalogue of those Subjects whom they are yet pleased to stile faithfull. What passed between mee and any Member either of the Parlia∣ment or Army, as it will not at all advantage His Majesties affairs to relate; so will it not any way conduce to my vindication. This word I shall only let sall, That a wiser man then I, or whoever is my great∣est censurer, would and ought to have given credit to them, when power and interest accompanied with large expressions of good will, were the arguments and motives to gain beleef of their reall intentions. Nay truly, though His Majestie had known they intended nothing lesse then the performance of those duties to their Soveraigne and Country, I cannot finde (I know not what a quicker-sighted man might have done) how in prudence his Majestie could have pursued any other in∣terest, or made any other application then what he did, considering the power under which hee was: Which shall serve by way of glance at my part of negotiation in generall, because even therein likewise I am not without some prejudice in many mens conceptions. Some few weeks before his Majesties remove from Hampton Court, there was scarce a day in which severall alarms were not brought to his Majestie, by, and from very considerable persons (both well affected to him, and likely to know much of what was then in agitation) of the resolution which a violent party in the Army had to take away his life: and that such a designe there was, there were strong
inducements to perswade; and I hope charity will be afforded to those many who were and still are of that belief, since I confesse my self to be of that number. Which practice seemed to his Majesty the more pro∣bable, for that many other particulars which were said in those informa∣tions to precede that action, fell out accordingly; whereupon his Ma∣jestie thought it not wisdome longer to despise the possible means left him for the prevention of that danger, and therefore resolved to re∣tire himself from thence, but with this positive intention, not to desert this Kingdom, either by crossing the Seas, or going into Scotland. The reasons his Majestie gave, you will pardon me if I deliver not, and su∣spend your Censure, in case your judgement invite you to oppose that result, till you hear the weight of them, and I will ingage the little credit the world hath left me, you shall be satisfied. And what man is hee, who hath the least grain of understanding, bears about him any affections either to his sacred Person, or to the Common good, hath any regard to his own duty or reputation, would have taken upon him to disswade his Majestie from what he had then resolved on, and thereby exposed himself both to the danger and guilt of that mischief, which so many had forewarned him of, and was so likely to happen? Sure I am, if I had been that man, I should have thought my self justly to have merited the Character of unfaithfulnesse, which is now so injuriously cast upon me. It rested then that his Majestie was to make choice of a place, where he might avoid the present danger, where he might give least offence to the interest of the Parliament and Army, where he might have fre∣quent intercourse with both, for setling a Peace (of which he then despaired not;) and lastly, where he might most securely (and the measure of safety was, where there were no Souldiers) expect the a∣batement of the ruinous power of the Levellers and their faction, to be the fruits of the General Rendezvous, which was immediately to follow. Upon these grounds, his Majestie thought the Isle of Wight most proper for his residence, especially if he could obtain honourable Con∣ditions from the Governour of that place; to whom (when his Ma∣jestie was come within twenty miles) he commanded Sir John Berke∣ley and my self to repair, and make trial of what Reception we could procure for him; who, after some consideration of what we propo∣sed, proffered this Engagement, [That since it appeared his Majestie
came from Hampton-Court to save his life, if he pleased to put himself in∣te his hands, whatever he could expect from a person of honour or honesty, his Majestie should have it made good by him:] which truely to us seem∣ed sufficient; and I do for my own part acknowledge, my confidence was, that, by that Engagement, he would not have laid any restraint upon his Majestie, nor have given accesse to any Souldiers into that Island: But how honourably and how faithfully he hath performed his promised duty to the King, you are as good a witnesse as my self; and therefore, as I take little pleasure in the memory of it, so there will be little satisfaction to you in the repeating it: it shall suffice that I have now been taught, that Honour and Honesty have clear con∣trary definitions in several mens understandings. For the election his Majestie made of the Isle of Wight, upon the grounds before mentioned, as therewith I did then concur, so (with respect to their judgements who are otherwise perswaded) I do still believe it was (as his affairs then stood) the best of any place which he could make choice of: And I will not be afraid to avow my opinion, because successe hath made it seem lesse reasonable; which being taken out of the Scale, and all circumstances worthy debate before his de∣parture from Hampton-Court, considered; perhaps wiser men then chose, who in that presume to condemn his Majesties judgement, may yet approve of that choice. However, his Majestie was resolved to go from Hampton-Court; and, I know not what other mens customs are, I cannot but be well satisfied with my own, which hath been ever ready to submit, when his Majestie hath been willing to com∣mand; and I should account it a great misfortune to me, that his com∣mands should be such, to which I should think fit rather with humility to oppose my reasons, then with cheerfulness to obey his pleasure; but that straight hath never yet happened, nor (I am confident) ever will: so careful is his Majestie to impose nothing upon any man, but what he believes just and lawful. That any Member of the Parliament or Army had any knowledge by me of his Majesties removal from Hampton-Court, or that any Compact between me and any of them was ever made, to the disser∣vice of his Majestie in any particular whatsoever, I provoke them and all the world to produce the least colour of proof, and desire that no man would spare me more then I should do such whom I found guilty of so base a crime; and shall not stick to invite them to it, who have
been so liberal in blasting my reputation, when I may live with that freedom they do, which either their greater wisdom, or their lesse loy∣alty then mine, hath purchased. In the mean time, it is some comfort to me to finde these censurers to be men but of such dispositions, as will hazard no more then onely their good wishes for his Majestie; and for such I take them, and for such leave them. If I should tell these severe judges of other mens actions, that his Majesties present personal condition is the same in the Isle of Wight, with what it was when he left Hampton-Court, they would perhaps wonder at me, but upon examination finde it truth: for before his Ma∣jesties coming from thence (at least six days) he was forbidden riding abroad, and confined within the limits of that place. And if any man can assure me, that if his Majestie had continued at Hampton-Court, the Parliament would not have presented these four Bills to him, or that they being presented, his Majesties refusing to make them Laws, should not have drawn on his late restraint, or the la∣ter Votes of Parliament concerning farther application to his Majestie, I shall then (for indeed I take that to be the cause of his relapse) with great lowlinesse of spirit acknowledge my self to have been an unhap∣pie (though not an unfaithful) instrument in his Majesties remove from Hampton-Court: But till then, my sufferings in these scandals may be continued, but my opinion not changed, nor the quietnesse of my minde disturbed, for having in that action discharged my duty to his Ma∣jestie. As for the money I should have received for betraying his Majestie, if none of my Calumniators have more to subsist on, then I have had either from Parliament or Army, they would be in worse condition, then (notwithstanding all their malice to me) I wish them. In ear∣nest, it would better have become those who first designed me this in∣famy, to have made choice of some, who had a mark upon them for doing some action, which may at least be of kin to the accusation, though but between fellow-subjects: but you will pardon my vanity, if I say I abhor such unworthinesse, and defie mankinde to bring the least blemish of that nature in judgement against me. I have done, when I have told you, that I have heard Divines say, that God doth most punish us in those things we most prize, and think our selves most concerned: I shall therefore hope to make a religi∣ous use of these aspersions cast upon my integrity: for I fear I did
glory too much in my honour of faithfulnesse and loyalty to his Ma∣jestie, and did not thankfully consider (as I ought to have done) that it was the blessing of God which enabled me to go thorow with the performance of my duty in his service. If men would but as well think upon the solicitude and care of their mindes, who are honoured with neer relations to the service of great Princes, as they look upon the advantages which thereby Fortune may cast upon them, they would finde more cause to pity them for their la∣bour and hazards (which is ordinarily beyond their capacities to fa∣thom, who are at very remote distance) then to envie them for their honour or profit. But since of all evils seated in the heart of man, Malice hath the greatest dominion, it were vain for Vertue it self to hope for freedom from those effects which naturally arise from it; and much more for me, who though in this particular have as much innocence to protect me, as can be consistent with mortality, yet in other things which may be imputed to weakness, and unskilfulness in matters of great concernment, I do with all ingenuity confesse, no man carries a greater weight of guilt then he whose care it is, to preserve unspotted the reputation of an honest man, thereby to retain still the favour and affection, wherewith you have constantly honoured, Sir, Your most faithful, and most humble servant, John Ashburnham. FINIS.
