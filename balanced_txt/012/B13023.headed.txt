royal blazon or coat of arms HONI SOIT QVI MAL Y PENSE DIEV ET MON DROIT ❧ By the King. ❧ A Proclamation prohibiting the Exportation of Corne and Graine. WHereas many good Lawes and Statutes haue beene hereto∣fore made and established, prohibiting the Exportation and Transportation of any Corne or Graine, and Wee in pursuance of them, haue by sundrie Our Proclamations prohibited the same, which haue not taken such effect as Wee expected. And hauing ta∣ken into Our Princely consideration, that by reason of the late vnseasonable weather, the hopefulnesse of the next ensuing Har∣uest is very much indangered, by which, and by the former Ex∣portations, the Stores of Corne for the Prouision of this Kingdome will be much shortened, and the prices in all probabilitie may be much enhaunced. And forasmuch as Wee are enformed that the scarcitie of Corne and Graine in the Neigh∣bouring Kingdomes and parts from whence Our Dominions in times of Dearth or Scar∣citie haue formerly beene furnished and stored, is such, as little hope of Reliefe is to be expec∣ted or looked for from them: We therefore desiring as much as in Vs lyeth, by Our timely prouidence, to take speedy care for the preuention of the many inconueniences, which other∣wise may happen and ensue, haue thought fit by and with the aduice of the Lords and o∣thers of Our Priuy Councell to declare and publish Our Royall Will, Pleasure and Com∣mand therein. And Wee doe hereby straitly charge, prohibite and command, That no person or persons whatsoeuer shall, or doe, from henceforth attempt, presume, or goe about to transport, export, or send away any Corne or Graine whatsoeuer out of this Our Realme of England, or Do∣minion of Wales, or from any the Ports, Hauens or Creekes of the same, into any the parts beyond the Seas, vntill Our Royall pleasure be further declared to the contrary, although
the prices of such Corne or Graine, shall fall out to bee vnder the Rate limited by the Statute for transportation of Corne and Graine in that behalfe, any former Licence, or other com∣mand whatsoeuer to the contrary in any wise notwithstanding, vpon paine of forfeiture of all such Corne and Graine so to be Shipped, to bee exported or transported, contrary to Our Royall Commandement herein expressed, and also vpon such further Paines, Penalties, Pu∣nishments and Imprisonments, as by any the Lawes and Statutes of this Our Realme, or by Our Prtrogatiue Royal can or may be inflicted vpon the Offendors in this behalfe. And for the better Execution of Our will and pleasure herein, Wee doe hereby straitly Charge, will, require and Command, All and singuler Our Customers, Comptrollers, Collectors, Searchers, Wayters, and all other the Officers and Ministers, of all and euery Our Custome-houses and Ports of this Our Kingdome, that they and euery of them doe not vpon payne of Our high Indignation and displeasure, and losse of their Places and Offices, permit or suffer any Corne or Graine to be Shipped, to be Exported, or Transported, as afore∣said, but shall and will forthwith seize the same as forfeited to Vs. And whereas Abraham or Arthur Rutter hath by Counterfeiting of diuers Licences, as Wee are informed, beene the cause of the vndue Transporting of much Corne; Wee doe hereby strictly Charge and Command, all and singuler Our Officers and Subiects whatsoeuer, to vse all care & diligence for the finding of the said Rutter, and being found to apprehend him, and carry him before the next Iustice of the Peace, whom Wee doe hereby will & require to com∣mit him to the Gaole of that County where he shall be apprehended, and thereof speedily to certifie Vs or Our Priuy Councell, To the end he may be proceeded against according to his demerits. And Wee doe further hereby Will and Command, All Mayors, Sheriffes, Iu∣stices of Peace, and other Officers and Ministers within this Our Realme of England, to take notice of this Our Royall Command, and to see the same duely obserued, as well in the apprehending of the said Rutter, as in the execution of all other the Premisses, as they tender Our pleasure, and will auoid Our heauy Indignation and displeasure for the contrarie. Giuen at Our Court at White Hall, the thirteenth day of Iune, in the sixt yeere of Our Reigne. God saue the King. ¶ Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most Excellent MAIESTIE: and by the Assignes of Iohn Bill. M.DC.XXX.
