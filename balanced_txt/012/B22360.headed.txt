WHereas by reason of the long and cruell Siege of the Towne of Lyme by Prince Maurice, and his whole Army, for full two moneths, great numbers of miserable poore People, have lost their Houses and Goods by fire, other their Husbands, Children, and other Friends by the Sword, so that they are left utterly, destitute and desolate, in the midst of a plundered and wasted Coun∣try.

And my Lord Major is hereby desired to advance this so pious and charitable work by dispersing this Order to all the Parishes within the Cities of London and Westminster, and within the Lines of Communication and Bills of Mortality. H. Elsynge Cler. Parl. D. Com. Ordered to bee Printed.
