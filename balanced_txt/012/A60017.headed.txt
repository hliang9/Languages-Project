A CONSPIRACY OF THE SPANIARDS Against the State of VENICE. Out of French. LONDON, Printed by J. D. for Richard Chiswel, at the Rose and Crown in St. Pauls Church-yard, 1675.
A Conspiracy of the Spa∣niards against the State of Venice, &c. AMongst all Humane Enter∣prizes Conspiracies are cer∣tainly of greatest conse∣quence; for Courage, Pru∣dence and Fidelity, being e∣qually requisite to every Member are Qualities rare in themselves, therefore much more rarely found to concur in single persons. We are inclined for the most part to flatter our selves with an opinion of being better beloved than we are, especially when our Merit seconds our Belief, and we have been studious in the Art of obli∣ging. Hence some Principal Conspirators are drawn to rely entirely upon the Affection of their Party; but there is scarce any Friendship so powerful as the fear of Death, for Affection if it prove violent, perverts the Judgment in all occurrences of surprize; the aids of Dis∣cretion
being seldom at hand: and whosoever give violent instances of their Love towards any one thing, betray Infirmity and too much Subjection to their Passions. If a Conspirator on the other hand be a man of Judgment, and that there is no reason to suspect his Prudence, then the same Vertue tempers his ardour, and renders his Zeal less active than the others: he is apter to fall into the contemplation of the great hazard to which he is exposed, and of the Methods wise∣ly to disengage him; to weigh that the pro∣fits accrewing by the Conspiracy are uncer∣tain, and that to reveal it to such against whom it is contrived, his Reward is sure. Moreover the general Talents and Abilities of Men are the product for the most part of their Experience, and their reasonings seldom prove solid in affairs unpractised; Wisdom being a profiting from Errors committed, and collect∣ing thence Rules for our safer Government in the future. But since there is no comparison, either for the danger, or the difficulty, between a Conspiracy, and any other kind of Enterprize; (no Experience whatsoever in other affairs be∣ing able in any measure to enlighten Us in the conduct and managements of this) to be safe therefore against the commission of any consi∣derable Errour, imployes our acquaintance in
the Profession, and it is very rare to find a per∣son that has been twice Engaged in Affairs of this kind: for if he succeed in his first Attempt, the profits that accrew thereupon secure him against the need of exposing himself to a se∣cond danger; and if he miscarry, he is either crushed in the ruines, or will hardly be drawn to run a second risque, if he escape. To these hazards we must add, that how detested soever a Tyrant may be, yet Self-Love proves ever more powerful than our Hate towards others: For it is not enough that Conspirators be real∣ly men of Fidelity, if every Member be not so possest of all his Companions; and a Leader ought to have as serious and equal regard even to the Panick Fears, and the most airy Imagi∣nations that may occur, as to the solider and more important difficulties of his Enterprize, as being equally capable of mischief: For a sin∣gle Word spoken upon a Foreign Subject; a Gesture, without any design, may beget a sus∣picion of Treachery, and cause a precipitate Execution: also a Circumstance of time, or place, being in it self of no considera∣tion, may yet occasion much Surprize and Ap∣prehension: and all this, from the difficulty of providing against such variety of Chances. For such is the nature of man, that he fancies every body discyphers his heart, and studies to suspect he is discovered from all that is said
or done in his presence; and the Conscience of guilt corrupting our Reason attaqu's us by e∣very object. And now if the difficulties are insuperable in Conspiracies against single Per∣sons, What judgment can be made upon the in∣vading of Multitudes, and when we aspire to to the Ʋsurpation of whole Cities or States, wherein will be requir'd more time to con∣trive and digest, and greater numbers to ex∣ecute the Design? These Reflections have taught me to consider such Enterprizes as points of History, of all others the most moral and instructive, and are my Motive to the ma∣king publick a Conspiracy of an Embassadour from the Court of Spain to the State of Venice against that Common-wealth, about fifty six years since. I know not whether or no my Judgment may have been seduced by my affection to the Subject I have undertaken; though I must in∣genuously avow, I know none that affords greater instance of the effects of Prudence in the Transactions of the World, or of Chance; of the vast extent of Humane Wit, and its vari∣ous confines, of its Elevations the most aspi∣ring, and its most secret Failings, the infinite circumspection necessary to Government; the difference between Good and Evil Arts, and between Wisdom and Subtilty: and if Malice be most hateful in the abuse of things the
most excellent, then may this History be an ar∣gument of our greater Horror, where we find the most excellent Qualities employed to an End the most detestable. And hence a wise Greek, as we read, observing a Criminal per∣sist in an untruth amidst his torments with a marvelous Constancy, could not forbear ex∣claiming; Oh unfortunate wretch, that could use so excellent a Vertue to so base a purpose! The difference between Paul the fifth, and the Republick of Venice being composed by the power of France with the Honour due to the Holy See, and the deserved Glory of the Vene∣tians, Spain alone found thence subject of Complaint; for having espoused the Papal In∣terest, and proposing to reduce the Venetians by force of Arms, they were offended that a Treaty should be entred upon with so little re∣gard to them; but having more narrowly stu∣died the secret of that Accommodation, they found no just occasion of Complaint against his Holiness, & that the Contempt which appear∣ed to have been done to them in that Affair, proceeded wholly from the Venetians: for it was the Senate that endeavoured to exclude them (in some sort) the Mediation, pretend∣ing they could not well be Judges that had shewed so much partiality. How distasteful soever this Injury might be, yet they gave no hint of their resentment during the reign of
Henry the fourth; the Obligations which that Prince stood in towards the Venetians were too publick, and the Care he exprest of their Interest during their difference with the Court of Rome was no less; but his Death setting the Spaniard at Liberty, there wanted then nothing but a Pretext. There inhabited in the Territory of the house of Austria, in the quarter coasting upon the Adriatick and contiguous to that of the Venetians, a nest of Pyrats known by the name of Ʋscocks: these Pilferers having committed innumerable violences upon the Subjects of the Republick, were protected by the Arch-Duke Ferdinand de Gratz then Sovereign of that Country and afterwards Emperor; himself was a very Pious Prince, but his Ministers were sharers in the booty with the Ʋscocks, and be∣ing avowed Friends to the Spaniard made use of this occasion to revenge them on the Venetians. The Emperor Matthias moved by the just in∣stances of the Republick composed this diffe∣rence at Vienna in February Anno Dom. 1612. but the Accomodation was so ill observed on the part of the Arch-Duke that they came at length to an open War, wherein he was not so clear a Gainer as the Spaniards had proposed to themselves. The Venetians by their good conduct easily
repaired the slight Damages they sustained in some little Encounters, and being at that time secure against the least apprehension of the Turks, they were better able to support the War, than the Arch-Duke. That Prince was at length pressed by the Emperor to make a Peace in contemplation of the Grand Seignor's menacing of Hungary; himself also became engaged in a very considerable expence in fa∣vour of his Election to the Kingdom of Bohe∣mia, which happened soon after: The Spa∣niard would gladly have contributed towards the continuation of this War, had not that also in which they were then engaged with Charls Emmanuel Duke of Savoy forbid the separati∣on of their Forces, and that Duke being sup∣plied with large Sums from the Republick could by no means be wrought to violate his Amity with them. The Spanish Council laid deeply to heart the exceeding prosperity of the Affairs of Venice, and the soft & peaceable Tem∣per of King Philip, and that of his Favourite the Duke of Lerma, suggested little or no pro∣spect of a redress: But a Minister of theirs, re∣sident at that time in Italy, not guilty of the same Moderation, undertook the business; and this was Don Alphonso de la Cueva Mar∣quis of Bedamar, Ordinary Ambassador at Ve∣nice, a Man of the most exalted Understanding and dangerous Spirit that Spain has ever pro∣duced:
his own Writings, that are yet extant speak him qualified with all the requisits that Historians ancient and modern have set down to compose an extraordinary Man; he com∣pared past Transactions with the Occurrences of his own time, he observed exactly the dif∣ferences and resemblances of Affairs, and how much those which seem to be alike are changed by what is different; he was able to give his judgment of the Issue from the first draught & project of any Enterprize: If he found he had prophesied amiss, he would trace his Error back to the source, and learn the true cause of his mistake; by this study he became throughly acquainted with the surest Mothods, the truest Means, and the most material Circumstances that presage success to any great Adventure, and render them for the most part prosperous; his practice of perpetual reading, meditation, and observance of Transactions of the world, had raised him to that high pitch of Wisdom, that his conjectures as to the result of any Affair were esteemed in the Court of Spain as so ma∣ny Prophesies. To this profound Learning in the nature of great Affairs was joyned a sin∣gular Dexterity in the conductive part, a Faci∣lity in speaking and writing with a most charming elegance, a marvelous Felicity in the knowledg of men, a Behaviour ever gay and open, wherein one read more heat than gra∣vity,
so remote from Dissimulation as to look like Simplicity, a Humour free and complisant, and so much the more impenetrable by how much every body thought they understood him; of Manners, soft, insinuating and in∣dearing, whereby he serewed himself into the most dark and difficult Secrets, always preser∣ving a perfect calm and serenity of Counte∣nance amidst the most violent and cruel agita∣tations of Spirit. The Spanish Ministers had at that time a great ascendent on the Govern∣ments wherein they resided, and the Marquis of Bedamar was chosen for Venice in the year 1607. as to the most difficult of all Forreign Employments, wherein he could hope no affistance from either Women, Priest, or Fa∣vorite; the Council of Spain was so well pleased with his Ministery, that how needful soever his service was to them at home, yet in the space of six years they could not resolve to recal him. So long a Residence gave him lei∣sure to study the principles of that Govern∣ment, to penetrate their most retired Cabinets, to discover their strengths and weaknesses, their advantages and defects; He foreseeing that the Arch-Duke would be necessitated to make a Peace, and that it would reflect shame∣fully upon them, the Injury being wholly on their part, he resolveth to embarque in some Design that might prevent it: he considered
that the present state of Affairs in Venice did not render the Design of mastering it impracti∣cable, by the Intelligence he had acquired & the Forces he was able to provide. Their Armies had dreined their Magazines of Arms, and had in a greater measure diminished their Peo∣ple capable of bearing them; and as their Navy had never been in a more flourishing condition, so their Senate had never been considered so for∣midable, or held a better opinion of their own Security: howbeit, this invincible Fleet was ob∣liged to be still hovering upon the Coast of Istria, the then seat of the War; the Army too was as remote; so that in Venice there was scarce any thing that could suggest a reason a∣gainst the descent of the Spanish Naval Army: To render this descent more secure, the Mar∣quis of Bedamar resolved to possess himself of two principal posts, and those were the place of St. Mark & the Arsenal; but he considered the difficulty would be great, without some acci∣dent to disturb the repose the City at present enjoyed; he proposed therefore the applying fire in several places the most combustible and the mostneedful of relief about the City. He was not over-hasty in rendring an account hereof to his Master, knowing how tender most Prin∣ces are of explaining themselves upon Affairs of this nature until they are ripened to a degree of affording nothing more to execute, but an
assurance of possession, in case it take effect; he contented himself barely to remark to the Duke of Ʋseda principal Secretary of State, that upon considering the dishonour the House of Austria had sustained by the insolent be∣haviour of the Venetians during the War of Friol, and that all the means that had been pro∣posed for an accord, both at Vienna and else∣where, resulted in Ignominie and Contempt; he considered himself in a Station wherein Na∣ture, as well as Policy, did oblige a faithful Subject to have recourse to all imaginable Arts, to preserve his Prince and Country, from an Infamy otherwise inevitable; and that Care be∣came especially incumbent on him in regard of the Employment he exercised, wherein ha∣ving continually before his eyes the very Sour∣ces and Spring-heads of those evils so impor∣tant of Redress, no man was a better Judg than himself what sort of Remedy to apply, and that he would attempt to acquit himself of that Duty in such manner as should be worthy the Zeal he profest for the Glory of his Master. The Duke of Ʋseda, who was throughly acquainted with his Worth, soon comprehen∣ded that his discourse was the disguise of some Project equally important and dangerous; but as wise men seldom pry deeper into Secrets of this nature than they are compell'd, he forbore to communicate his thoughts thereupon to the
chief Minister, and only replyed to the Mar∣quis of Bedamar, in general terms, extolling his Zeal, and committing the rest to his accu∣stomed Prudence. The Marquis that lookt for no other, was not at all surprized at so cold an answer, and now studied nothing more than to dispose his Design that he might have perfect Assurance of the wished Event. The World never had Monarchy so abso∣lute as is the Empire by which the Senate of Venice governs that Republick; they observe a wonderful difference betwixt their Nobility & those that are not so, weighing even the most scrupulous and minute circumstance. Their Nobles only are qualified to govern in the re∣spective Countrys of their Obedience; The most eminent Gentry and Principal Magi∣strates of the Country living among them with the distinction rather of Sovereigns than Governours: and in case the Republick con∣fers at any time Offices of trust in their Mili∣tia upon Strangers, it is always on strict con∣ditions of their perfect Obedience to the Senti∣ments of their Generalissimo, which is ever a Venetian, who in effect never affords them o∣ther latitude than the executive part. As there is no Pretension so plausible as a War, for taxation of the People, that of the Ʋscocks gave a fair occasion for inriching the
Nobility of Venice, by whose conduct it was managed: this alone was an extraordinary Expence, and over and above the Treasure re∣mitted to Piedmont, they were constrained to maintain also a third Army in Lombardy to at∣tend the motions of the Governour of Milan, who daily threatned them with a diversion in favour of the Arch-Duke. The Justice of the Republick's cause rendred their Ministers yet more hardy in contriving new vexations, but not the People more patient in suffering them; herein they proceeded to such a degree as gave the Marquis of Bedamar reasonable Assurance to believe that the Revolution he had medita∣ted, would be almost as welcom to the Com∣monality, as fatal to the People of Quality. Among them also there were many that were grown out of love with the Government, and these were the Partizans of the Court of Rome; and indeed were the greatest number, ambitious and revengeful, resenting the Repub∣lick's having governed against their Councils during their contest with that Court: These seemed prepared to do or suffer any thing, to wrench the Authority out of their hands that then had i & would joyfully have beheld the Government unfortunate, as being the fruits of a Conduct they had disapproved. There was another shallow sort of Fools that would be more Catholick than the Pope, who upon
his Holiness relinquishing his Pretensions in the Accomodation, conceived he had been ob∣liged thereunto by the Rules of Policy, and consequently that if there was any mental Re∣servation in that proceeding, that it was to be feared the sentence of Excommunication still rested in force in the Intentions of his Holi∣ness: Of this number some were Senators, men as Indigent in their fortunes as their minds; these were of great use in the pursuit of the Marquis of Bedamar's Design, who, converted by expensive Gifts, became perswaded, that since that Negotiation none could be longer a Vene∣tian with a safe Conscience. Notwithstanding the rigorous Injunctions against the Nobilities holding correspondence with strangers, yet the Marquis found means to contract a very inti∣mate understanding with the necessitous and male-content Party; and in case any of these had either near Kinsman in Religious Orders, a Mistress, or any familiar Ecclesiastick, these he would compass at any rate; buying them with Presents of considerable value, making use of nothing ordinary, but curiosities from For∣reign parts: such Liberalities, on so slen∣der Motives, gave encouragement to the Recei∣vers to hope for something yet more consider∣able: In which prospect they informed him with all simplicity to the full of his Curiosity, & laboured also to furnish themselves in many
doubtful points the better to enable them to comply with his Demands; and his acknow∣ledgments still transcending their assiduity gave at length incitement to their Engaging their Patrons also in this Commerce. It is still to be concluded that Poverty was the principal wheel of this Engine, and that these Noble men could not regard but with an eye of envy, People entirely their dependents should on their consideration become more rich than themselves: But however it came to pass, from thence forth there was nothing debated by the Senate that was a Secret to the Spanish Ambassador: His advertisements were so pun∣ctual of all their resolutions, that the Generals of the Arch-Duke became still instructed in whatsoever had relation to the War before those of the Republick could receive Orders for their execution: Together with this In∣telligence it imported the Ambassador to have a considerable number of Soldiers to give life to his Enterprize; but the Spaniard having a strong Army in Lombardy, he saw no difficul∣ty in that point, provided there might be a Go∣vernour of Milan qualified to joyn with him in the Design. The Marquis de Inojosa, that then held that place, had contracted too near an Allyance with the Duke of Savoy, to be thought fit; he was newly returned from sign∣ing the Treaty at Ast, where the French and
Venetians had been Mediators between that Duke and him. The Ambassadour knowing that the negotiation would not be well relish∣ed in Spain, writ that he might be recalled; and at the same time solicited Don Pedro de Toledo Marquis de Villa Franca, his intimate Friend, to make his Interest to succeed him in the Government of Milan. Don Pedro had hereupon Orders for his departure to fill Ina∣josa's place about the end of the Year 1615. and before he was quite arrived he dispatched advice to Venice by the Marquis de Lara. The Ambassador communicates his Project to the Marquis in terms the most agreeable, charging him principally to inform himself if the new Governour could be able to provide him of 1500 choice Men, when he should see occasion. Don Pedro charmed with the Grandeur of the Enterprize resolved to second him in what he was able, not exposing himself to a certain ru∣ine in case of a defeat; He therefore dispatches the Marquis de Lara a second time to confirm the Ambassador, and also to request him to consider that the Souldiers he demanded were to be the choicest pickt Men, and in case they perisht, he should remain without excuse to have exposed to so manifest a hazard the whole Flower of his Army; howbeit he would not fail to provide him as many as possibly he could, and that they should be such as he would
answer for as for himself. Nothing was so im∣portant to this Design of the Ambassador as to obstruct all means tending to an Accommoda∣tion; on which consideration he obliged the Marquis de Lara to make Propositions of Peace to the Senate very unreasonable on the behalf of the Governour of Milan: The Se∣nates reply was as they expected, full of In∣dignation, and refusing to enter into a Treaty with them: Don Pedro also was wanting in nothing on his part to perplex matters; The Duke of Mantua was cold in his disposition of pardoning his Rebel Subjects, according to his Promise at the Treaty at Ast, and was en∣couraged in his obstinacy touching that Arti∣cle, & to persevere in his Executions he had al∣ready begun amongst them: Propositions were also made to the Duke of Savoy in relation to the fulfilling of that Treaty, forseeing that he would not accept it; they likewise excused disbanding their Army, as he had done, and as they ought, with pretext grounded on the War of Friol, wherein the Spaniard could no longer with honour refuse to take a Share. The Venetian Army had passed the Lyzonz, and besieged Gradisque the Capital City in the Arch-Dukes Territories; Whereupon The Council of Spain, who hitherto had observed a Neutrality, foreseeing the damages were like to ensue to that Prince, threatned to de∣clare;
About the same time expired the misun∣derstanding that had been in the House of Au∣stria between the two branches of Spain and Ger∣many, after the contest between the Son & Bro∣ther of Charles the fifth touching the succession of the Empire: The Interest the Spaniard took in that War was the first instance of that Recon∣cilement. Don Pedro ordered the Camp-ma∣ster Gambeletta to advance towards Crema with his troops, and commanded the mount∣ing of 24 pieces of Battery at Pravia, which as he publisht to the World, were to be the train to a Body of 8000 men, to march under the conduct of Don Sancto de Luna. On the o∣ther hand the Vice-King of Naples, that was then cruizing in the Mediterranean with the Spanish Fleet, threatned to attack the Duke of Savoy at Villa Franca; he blockt up all the passages of relief by Sea to the Republick, and appeared always in a posture of Sayling into the Gulf, to be a check there upon the Ve∣netian Fleet. The Ministers of that State made loud Complaints in all Courts touching this violent proceeding, which the Marquis of Bedamar undertook to justifie; he also foresaw that it would be of great use in his Design to undermine, if it were possible, the very Foun∣dation of their repute, famed throughout Eu∣rope for so many ages for the most Ancient and Free of all States: their Freedom had been
newly proved to the World, and magnifi∣ed more than ever (upon occasion of their late Difference with the Pope) by several Discourses that were supposed unanswerable; albeit the adverse Party wanted not able Instruments in the management of that Contest. This the Ambassador fell to examine anew, and in a few Chapters refuted all that the numerous Volumes of Venetian Authors had said on that Subject, without so much as doing any one of them the honour of making mention of his Name: And as there is no Proposition relating to matters of that sort which an able man may not render very problematick, upon pretext of establishing the Emperial Right in Venice, he obviated that the Independence of that Repub∣lick was as Chimerical as their Empire of the Ocean; it was not convenient for his purpose that he should be known the Author of this Libel, he therefore Publishes it with so cauti∣ous a Secrecy that it came not to Light during his Life, howbeit it seems strange he should not be suspected; but it is also to be believed that the Venetians at that time scarce under∣stood him; his behaviour airy and so full of emportment, (for so he studied to appear) would not permit them to conceive that a man of a Character so impetuous, could be author of so refin'd and studied a Satyre of State. Justice and Honesty seemed qually to inspire him, and
his declamations against the Enterprizes of the Venetiaus, that went also mixed, were hand∣led with a Moderation very apparent which alone was sufficient to gain applause. This Work intituled Squittinio della Liberta Veneta, made much noise, and by reason of the obscu∣rity of the Author, the suspicion fell of course upon the Court of Rome, from the occasion of their former Writings; and the ablest Sena∣tors fancied all the World made their Judg∣ment of the weight thereof, and were more affrighted than at the loss of a Battle. Francis Paoblo had ordered to examine it; but he, who could trifle with the other Writers of the contrary Party, declared this last was by no means to be answered; it being impossible without Inlightning the World in Matters that imported more should still remain con∣cealed in the dark bosom of Antiquity; how∣ever he replied that in case the Senate judged it consistent with the Dignity of the Republick to resent the outrage, he engaged himself so to perplex the Court of Rome in their Defence, that they would hardly ever think of a second attack: this Intimation was approved in the heat of their displeasure, and gave Fra. Paob∣lo the satisfaction of publishing his beloved Hi∣story of the Council of Trent, which under less motive had not appeare during his Life. In the interim the Campagne in the year 1616
passed without any considerable action on ei∣ther side; the Duke of Savoy, and the State of Venice, being tender of exposing to a second Risque the glory they had already purchased, impowered Gritty the Venetian Ambassador at Madrid to renew the negotiation; but the Spaniard, irritated by the Difficulties they had encountred, contrived Propositions so unrea∣sonable that it took no effect. Gradisque con∣tinued, blockt up the enemy, maintaining their Battery during the Winter, and the Armies were in the field betimes with an ardour that promised more success than the preceeding year. The Dutch Truce had rendred the greatest part of the Souldiery of that State useless, and many Soldiers of Fortune both French and Germans sought employment elsewhere; The Count of Nassaw and Leivesteine marched with 8000 men, Dutch and Walloons, to the Vene∣tians Service; Whereupon the Spaniards zeal∣ously complained to the Pope, that the Vene∣tians did expose Italy to the infection of Heresy by their entertaining that Militia: but the Ambassador of Venice remonstrated, that it was not so much the Spaniards concern for Religion that produced that Complaint, as their appre∣hension to see two great Republicks in con∣junction against them. The Marquis of Be∣damar would have been much perplext had
the Pope obliged the Venetians to dismiss those Troops; for as the major part of Mili∣tary people regard nothing so much as their profit, when they are in service under a For∣reign Prince, he hoped to draw the chief of Mercenaries into his Design, convincing them by largesses and the hopes of pillaging Venice. In this contemplation he fixt upon an ancient French Gentleman, by name Nico Renault, a per∣son of experience and understanding, who had taken refuge at Venice for some cause that was unknown; The Marquis of Bedamar observed him to have been a long time resident at the French Ambassadors, and from some accidental Discourses had been between them Renault dis∣covered him to be no less an able Man than fame had rendred him: and the Marquis who was glad to purchase a friend of his Character near the Ambassador of France, had contracted a strait Intimacy with Renault, who though a man extreamly indigent, yet preferred Vertue to Riches; howbeit could sacrifice his Vertue to his Ambition, and whensoever innocent methods should fail him in the pursuit of Glo∣ry, there were none too ill for his purpose: he had learnt out of ancient Authors that most excellent Indifference relating to life and death, which is the sure Foundation of an extraordi∣nary Design, and ever regretting those celebra∣ted times wherein the mer of particular men
composed the destiny of States, and where such as were possessors thereof never wanted occasions to make out their Title. The Mar∣quis of Bedamar that had thoroughly studied him, and that was in great want of a Man on whom intirely to confide in the conduct of his Enterprize reveals it at length to him, declar∣ing withal he had his eye fixt on him from the very beginning. Renault held himself ob∣liged more by that Assurance than from all the praises he could have heaped upon him; his years, wherein he was advanced, kept him steedy to his Engagements; the less Time he had to live the less was his Adventure; he conceived he could not better employ the few uneasy years he had yet to pass than to hazard them to the making his name Immortal. The Mar∣quis of Bedamar gave him Credentials and Bills of Exchange necessary to negotiate with the Hollands Officers; and charged him by no means to communicate the Design to them, and only to intimate that Affairs being embit∣tered to that degree between the Republick and the House of Austria, and the Spanish Am∣bassador resident at Venice, foreseeing a conjun∣cture that might expose his Person to the rage of the People of that City, to secure himself a∣gainst which he endeavoured to provide him∣self of a considerable number of trusty resolute Friends. This ptext was thin enough, but
the least disguize in Affairs of this nature is of great use; it imported but little though Peo∣ple suspected Mystery, provided the Truth re∣mained still in the dark: by this means he ho∣ped to debauch the Flower of the Venetian Land-Army, and for the remainder it would be so infeebled, that it would be a very easy task for Don Pedro to defeat them in their March, in case they should advance in oppo∣sition, to his design. Their Naval Army was indeed what gave greater reason of apprehension; they were at all times flesht with the opinion of Conquerors, and were easily transported; the greatest part of the Soldiery natural Subjects of the State, and it was to not be doubted but that upon the first rumor of the Conspiracy, they would fly with swiftest diligence towards Venice. To expect their defeat from the Spanish Navy was a doubtful point, and it had not been Pru∣dent to put to the hazard of a Battel the suc∣cess of an Enterprize that was otherwise so full of danger: It was therefore judged most to the purpose to contrive how to render their fleet uncapable of Service; The Ambassa∣dor, who was not so great a Master in Mari∣tine Affairs as the Vice-King of Naples, who at that time commanded the Spanish Armada, found it therefore needful to consult him up∣on that Subject: The Vi-King, who was
to be a principal Actor in this Tragedy of the Ambassador's, was that Duke of Ossuna, so fa∣mous for his Gallantries; a man as enterprizing as either Don Pedro or the Marquis of Beda∣mar: this Conformity of mind had begotten a very strait Intelligence between these three Ministers: but neither Don Pedro, nor the Duke, were the ablest Counsellors: the Duke would be sometimes guilty of excursi∣ons approaching to extravagance; howbeit the high opinion they held of the Marquis de Bedamar contained them within stricter bounds of Prudence than they profest. The pro∣fits accrewing to those that follow the Trade of Piracy under some fort of powerful Prote∣ction had drawn to the Court of the Vice-King of Naples all the renowned Pyrats of the Mediterranean: This Vice-King that was fruitful in extraordinary Adventures, and in his practice rather profuse than covetous, did not protect them so much with regard to the advantages he shared in their Booty, as to re∣tain always about him a considerable number of People fit for any Enterprize: and not con∣tent barely to receive them, but whensoever he found a man above the common Level, would covet and cherish him by such favours and presents as bound him fast to himself: he had treated after this sort a certain Captain by  Norman, and named Jacques Pierre, and
so excellent in his profession, that all others held it their Glory to proceed by his Rules and Example; a man whose manners had taken no impression from the barbarity of that course of life, who having purchased wherewithal to subsist, had resolved to quit it, albeit in the Flower of his age, and had made choice of the Duke of Savoy's Territory for his retreat, who being a Prince taken with every extraordinary Talent, and so much an abler Judge from what himself possest of Natures bounty, knowing this Corsair to have the repate of one of the bravest Men living, vouchsaft him leave to set∣tle himself in Nisa. All sorts of Maritine Peo∣ple, from Soldiers and Officers to the Seamen, that frequented that Coast, made their ordinary Court to the Captain, his Counsils were their Oracles, and he was Sovereign Arbiter of all their Differences, and was yet agreater Sub∣ject of their Wonder that he could be able to relinquish a profession wherein he was so great a Master, and which of all others was so hard to quit: of this number was one Vincent Ro∣bert de Marseilles who happened to touch in Sicily, where the Duke of Ossuna Govern∣ed as Vice-Roy, was by the kind treatment he received, induced to put himself into his Ser∣vice; The Duke having heard that this Robert had been a Comrade of the said Captains, would familiarly complain to him that his
Friend should prefer the Country of the Duke of Savoy to his Government for his retreat; to his complaint he added the highest testimonies of his esteem of the Courage and Experience of that Captain in Sea-matters, and finisht his dis∣course with assurance to spare nothing that in him lay to invite to his Court a Person of so singular merit. Robert with great Joy em∣barkt in this Affair which being managed with so generous advances on the Dukes part, the Captain was in the end vanquisht, and trans∣ported himself with his Wife and Family into Sicily, where living constantly entertained with a prospect of the Sea he became daily less Master of his Inclinations to that Element. The Vice-Roy had newly built several beau∣tiful Gallions, and it happened that a party of Turkish Vessels of great Value being on their Voyage with a very slender convoy, this temptation the Captain had not power to withstand; and he found no cause to repent him, for that he took in that attempt an in∣credible booty, the major part whereof the Duke (who from thence forwards entertained him with the Indearments of a Brother) be∣stowed on him, on condition he would accom∣pany him to Naples to which Government the Kings Instructions had ordained him, and that he would make a Voyage to Prevence, and labour to draw into his Stoice all the able
Mariners of his acquaintance upon that Coast: The Captain obeys him, and returns with a number sufficient to man five large Vessels that appertained immediately to the Vice-Roy; of this Squadron he was made Commander in chief, with which he Pillaged uncontrouled all the Islands and Coasts of the Levant, and finisht his first expedition with a Famous Battle wherein he took and sank a considerable Squadron of Turks Galleys. 'Twas about that time that the Marquis of Bedamar com∣municated his purpose to the Duke of Ossuna, with full assurance of his readiness to Embark with him: The Duke, that aspired to the Dominion of those Seas, wished nothing with so much ardour as the ruine of the Venetians, who were his only powerful Rivals, and could dispute their Title with more obstinacy than the Turks; He therefore confers with the Captain touching the Affair, obviating also the difficulties which the Captain believed were not Invincible, and after several days of secret Conference he leaves Naples abruptly, and in an Fquipage that betrayed both great haste and fear, the Vice-King dispatches People in his pursuit to all Quarters, but the way he had taken, with Order to take him dead or alive; his Wife and Children were from that day ta∣ken into Custody and treated with all appear∣ing Cruelty, his estate becae confiscate, and
the Dukes displeasure thundred with so much fury that the whole City of Naples was sur∣prized notwithstanding their long acquain∣tance with his violent temper: and now the Captain appearing also no less enraged than the Duke, gave an easie Argument for the Peo∣ples belief of the Misunderstanding, who be∣lieved he had practised something against the Spanish Interest; or that of the Dukes Designs in particular. In the mean time he returns to his first retreat; the Duke of Savoy was at that time in a declared War with Spain, and was famed for one of the most generous men of that age: and albeit he had publisht his dis∣pleasure at the Captains leaving his protection for a retreat in Sicily; yet that did not discou∣rage his presenting himself at the Dukes feet, to whom he made many false reports of Designs of the Vice-King against the Republick of Venice, full of imaginary Horror, but without any manner of agreement with the true pur∣pose, and that believing he could not with ho∣nor engage therein, he had meditated his and his families escape from Naples: But having notice that the Vice-Roy had received Intelli∣gence of his purpose, he had been constrained to fly in that miserable Equipage to escape his fu∣ry, and to abandon all that was dear to him in the world to the disposition of the most cruel man living; the Duke of Savoy was touched
with pity at the Melancholy recital, & received him with open arms; He told the Corsair that his Interests being straitly twisted with those of the Rpublick, he thought himself ac∣comptable for the Service he had rendred to their common Interest, in case the Venetians should be cold in their Acknowledgements; He also added, that it imported that the Senate should be instructed from his own Mouth of the Designs of the Duke of Ossuna, and after having exhorted him in a couragious support∣ing his affliction, having equipt him with all necessaries, and made him a noble present, dis∣patcht him towards Venice with his Letters of Credence and Recommendation. The Veneti∣ans were not less affected than the Duke of Savoy, the flight, the tears, the poverty, the despair, the abilities, the exploits, the hopes that he would draw to them that great number of brave men that he had conducted to the Duke of Ossuna's Service; but above all the Designs he revealed of that Dukes which he had invented as plausible as was necessary, all these circumstances spoke so Eloquently in his favour, that they immediately gave him the Command of a Ship. Howbeit Contarine the Am∣bassador at Rome did remonstrate, that in con∣sideration of his coming from the Vice-Roy, he was by no means to be trusted; but fear having wrought in the Spirits of the Venetians,
the usual effect of Belief, stopt their Ears to that prudent Advice. 'Twas not long er'e the Fleet put out to Sea, and the Captain, who considered of what Importance it was to signalize himself, took so many Prizes upon several Commissions he had received to pur∣sue them; that upon his return from that Ex∣pedition they added eleven Sayl of Ships to that he had. Of these happy successes he gave an Account to the Duke of Ossuna, finishing his Discourse in these words. If these Pan∣taleons proved in their easy Faith, as they have begun; I dare assure your Excellency, my Lord, that I shall lose no Time in this Country. He writ also at the same time to his several Comrades he had left at Naples, to draw them to that Service; which he found no difficulty to debauch; the Vice-King, upon his Flight, feigning to hold them all in suspicion, Treating them now as ill as be∣fore he had been kind: He made also great complaint of the Republiques protecting the Captain, and in Revenge, gave Sanctuary to several of the Ʋscocks that the Venetians had chased from their Habitations. By Virtue of his Protection, they began a Trade of Privateering; took a great Vessel bound from Corfu to Venice, and sold their Booty publickly under his Standard; He violated the freedom of Ports, and made very conside∣rable
Reprizals upon very slender Motives, and disputed the Orders he received from Spain for Restitution of what he had Seized; and publisht a Manifest to justify his Disobe∣dience. He sent also a great Fleet to Cruize in the Adriatique, and caused to enter in Triumph into Naples the Prizes that were made upon the Venetians. In brief, he ruined their Commerce at the cost of the Neapolitans themselves, who were interessed, and the Farmers of the Revenue of that Kingdom; offering to make complaint thereof, he for∣bade them on pain of Death. There being no declared War between Spain and the Repub∣lique, the Venetians became justly astonished at a proceeding so irregular: the Major part imputed it only to the bare extravagance of the Duke of Ossuna; but the Wiser sort, who knew there was nothing of so important Use as the dexterous and politick management of such People, had deeper conjectures, and that the Spaniard served himself of the Ca∣pricio's of the Duke, in order to such pro∣ceedings, as they would neither avow or maintain. His Familiar discourses were, Surprizing of the Ports in Istria belonging to the Repub∣lique, Pillaging their Islands, and also, if it were Practicable, to make a descant even up∣on the City of Venice the Design whereof
he discoursed among his Courtiers, he cau∣sed exact Draughts to be made of the Works about it; also the Building of several Barks, Brigantines, and other small Vessels, proper for all sorts of Channels: variety of Experi∣ments were also made, to discover what weight each depth of Water could sustain, & he invented every day new Engines to dimi∣nish the weight and facilitate the motion. The Venetian Resident at Naples punctually ac∣counted hereof to the great despair of the Marquess of Bedamar, who began to repent him of having joyned himself with so weak a Man: But the issue undeceived him. The Vice-Roy proceeding with all this Pomp and Noise, gave the Venetians cause to consider him in ridicule; even their Wisest Senators could by no means imagine, that any solid se∣cret could be masked under the disguize of so much Appearance and Publicity. The Duke continued his preparations with the same Vigor, whilst no body took the least notice or suspicion; and the same Indiscreti∣on that was held ruinous to the Enterprize, did more advance it than all the caution and circumspection of the Marquis of Bedamar. Howbeit, the Marquis judged it necessary to hasten the Execution, either from a reason of not giving the Venetians leisure to make Re∣flections, or from the hazard to which his per∣son
was daily exposed. The Venetian Fleet having upon an Expedition offered Battle to the Spaniards, which refusing, they plunder∣ed the Coast of Apulia; this success begat so insolent a Joy among the baser people, That, but for the Protection of the Guards that were sent in his favour, they had assassined the Ambassador with his whole Family. About the same time he received News from the Camp before Gradisque, which Relieved him upon that accident; Renault advising him that he found their Spirits so happily disposed, that the Negotiation was speedily effected. The Ambassador had ordered him to visit Mi∣lan before his return, where Don Pedro recei∣ved him with all the Caresses great Men pra∣ctise for the amusement of such as Sacrifice themselves in their Service: They concluded to∣gether, That it would much Import them to take possession of some Town in the Continent at the same time they should surprize Venice, which should be a Bridle on the other Towns, serve as a place of Arms to the Spanish Ar∣my that should March against them; and be a checque to that of the Venetians, in Case they should appear for their Relief. Renault Travelled through their Towns of chief importance, and sojourned some time at Crema, in Order to the forming a Faction in that Garrison; which he effected, and by
means of a French Lieutenant, named Jean Berard, an Italian Captain, and an Ensign that was a Provencal, one thatDon Pedro had already gained: These three engaged to re∣ceive 500 Spaniards into the Town, and without giving the least Jealousy to the Go∣vernour, who was a Venetian; and to conceal them for the space of eight days. Renault, on serious debate upon the place, concluded, That with that number of Men, the Design was infallible; there being nothing to do, but to cut the Throats of a miserable Garrison, that had been drawn out of the Country-Militia: all the Regular Troops of the Republique, being either in the Towns in Fryol, or upon Service in their Armies. The Duke of Ossuna had made the Mar∣quess de Bedamar of Opinion, That it would be necessary also, to make themselves Masters of some Venetian Port upon the Gulph, where∣by to render the Ʋscocks and the Arch-Duke, more Serviceable; and to be a retreat to the Spanish-Fleet, in Case any adverse accident should necessitate them to seek a Port in those Seas, after they should be engaged. To this purpose they made choice of Maran, a strong Town upon an Island confining upon Istria, and that had a Port capable to receive a great Fleet. An Italian, by name Mazza, that had be  Serjeant-Major there, for the space
of 40 years, and had authority almost equal to the Governors, promised the Dukes Emis∣sary in Consideration of a considerable sum of mony and the Command of the Place, to kill the Governor upon his first Order, and make himself Master of the Place for the Ser∣vice of the Spaniards. This Design was as feasible, as to engage in it: The Governor, who was the Commissary Lorenzo Theophilo, lived with him in great fa∣miliarity; and, whereas the charge of Com∣missary gave him much business upon that Frontier in time of War, he confided intirely on the Serjeant-Major, touching whatsoever had relation to matters within the Garrison, as being the most experienced and able Officer upon the place. Affairs being ripened to this Pitch, the Ambassador thought it now high time, to fall upon finishing his peice; not but that more time might give him leisure to add still maturer degrees to the measures he had taken, but he also knew, That there was nothing so fatal as delay, in Affairs of that nature. 'Tis impossible that all the different means that conspire to the prosperity of an Enter∣prize should be ascendent in one and the same moment; some change their Positions, whilst others are preparing; and whosoever is once so happy as to be able to unite a sufficient
number, it is a most capital error not to im∣prove the critical minute of so precious a con∣juncture. It highly concerned the honour of the Crown of Spain, that the Ambassador might not be convicted of having had the least hand in the Enterprize, in case it should miscarry; in contemplation whereof he re∣solved to discover himself to none of the Con∣spirators but Renault and the Captain: Nor had these two any Knowledg of each other; they never waited on the Ambassador but by his own Order, and he was always careful to appoint their Attendance, so as to avoid en∣countering; by which, had they chanced to be detected, it would have been much to his advantage that they had no understanding together. Upon this Consideration, he could have been well content that they should manage their business apart, without the least cogni∣zance each of other, as they had hitherto pro∣ceeded; but upon more deliberate thoughts he became convinced, that it was impossible; and despairing utterly of success in his Enter∣prize, but by a perfect Union and Friend∣ship between them, he resolved to overcome that difficulty, how hard soever it appeared. Albeit they were both men of Courage and Discretion; Renault valued himself principal∣ly upon the Conductive part, and to have so
methodized his business, that the Execution was most practicable, and the success Infal∣lible. The Captain on the other hand, being a person of more Youth and Vigour, studied especially to appear a Man of great Executi∣on, and capable of acquitting him of the high∣est Resolutions. To him the Marquess reveal∣ed the several Negotiations of Renault; his Experience, that furnisht him with Expedients against all accidents; his Eloquence and Ad∣dress, in Order to the acquiring new Parti∣zans; his skill in Corresp ondence, so very use∣ful in such Negotiations, wherein it was of so great importance to be continually instructed in the State of their Fleet, Provinces, and Armies; and That he concluded such a Person would prove of very great satisfaction to the Captain, he being a Man of years and great Experience, who wanted neither Courage nor Constancy; howbeit, his Age and Profes∣sion claiming more of the Councellor than the Soldier, rendred him uncapable of sharing with the Captain any part of the Glory of the Execution. As to Renault, he told him only, That the Captain was a Creature of the Duke of Ossuna's which Duke being to be the Principal Sharer in the Design, there could be no reasonable pretence to conceal any thing from his Confiden; he conjured him
therefore to condescend to the behaviour of the Corsair, as far forth as might be consistent with their purpose, and to treat him with all the Respect and Artifice as was necessary to ac∣quire the love of a Man of Action, fierce and presumptuous to the highest degree. The Marquis of Bedamar having thus la∣boured to dispose these two Men to a friendly understanding, was much astonished when he saw them embrace each other with Testimo∣nies of extream Affection, upon the very in∣stant of their Interview. There is no Constancy or Presence of mind so intire, that yields not to some imperfect reasonings upon Objects extreamly surprsing. The first judgment the Ambassador made, was, that he had been betrayed; for it having been his great care to hinder the Conference of these two Men, he could not comprehend upon what Motive they should conceal from him their acquaintance together: But this Mystery was soon revealed when he came to under∣stand, That their acquaintance arose from their having often encountred at a famous Greek Courtizan's House, a Woman of extraordi∣nary merit for one of her profession, whereof there could not be a greater Instance, than by her so religiously concealing the secret they had enjoyned her to make of each others Name.
This exactness of hers appeared also so much the more extraordinary by how much she was not ignorant that they had conceived a reci∣procal esteem one of the other. The Ambassador perfectly recovered of his Surprize, was ra∣visht to find so strict a Union, where he so much wisht it: they avowed upon entring into conversation, That they had respectively design'd to engage each other in the Enter∣prize. Having their thoughts continually agitated about this their Project, they happened some times amidst their entertainments at this Greeks to fall upon Discourses of matters of that na∣ture, talking of the Affairs of the Times, of State, and War, which they did without ma∣king any discovery, or indeed without the least purpose thereof; howbeit, they both confest ingeniously, in the presence of the Ambassa∣dor, That the warmth of their Debates had often transported them too far, and given too much Testimony of their Sentiments. The Ambassador intreated them thereupon, to make good use of that Reflection, for their greater Circumspection in the future, and col∣lect from that Experiment, That to keep a great Affair truly secret, it is not sufficient ei∣ther not to say, or do any thing that may have the least relation thereto, but even to en∣deavor to forget our own Impressions thereof.
Renault proceeded to observe, That, since the rumours of Peace, that revived again about the Month of June, the Venetian Offi∣cers had very ill treated the Forreign Troops; who, had they not been restrained by the Authority of Count Nassaw, which dyed about that time, they had rendred but an ill Account of their Service before Gradisque; That the Venetian General, who had a yet worse Opinion of them than they deserved, had separated them upon Posts, the most distant he could choose; That this Pre∣caution had publisht the diffidence they had of their Fidelity, and put them into mutiny; and having insolently refused to execute certain Orders of the Senate, the General had thought it his Duty to put to Death the principal Mutineers; That he had confin'd their Officers at Padua, and distributed the rest into di∣vers places of Lombardy, until they should be able to pay them, and the Ratification of the Treaties should permit their dismission. Re∣nault added, That the Lieutenant of the Count de Nassaw, who was one of the principal of those with whom he had dealt, had been confined at Brescia, and that he had laid a Design, by virtue whereof he would be able to deliver that Town into Don Pedro's possession: And that it was necessary to reslve first upon this parti∣cular Affair; for that the Lieutenants Letters
pressed for a decisive Answer. The Ambassa∣dor replyed, That it would not be necessary to give any Alarum on that side, before they were Masters of Venice: Moreover, they should not have occasion for more than one place in Lombardy; That they were sure of Crema, and that any other Enterprize would but divide their Forces; That hitherto they had entertained those they had gained at their own Devotion, but that they respited the Ex∣ecution upon various pretexts, and rather than expose themselves by the least noise, 'twould be better wholly to decline that Proposition. Renault replyed, That beside that Lieute∣nant, he had dealt with three French Gentle∣men, by Name, Durand, Serjeant-Major of Lievestines Regiment, Brainville and Brabe; also with a Savoyard, named Ternon, that had been at the Escalade of Geneva, a Hollander named Theodore, one Revillido, an Italian Engineer; two other Italians that had for∣merly had employment in the Arsenal, named Lewis de Villa Mezzana, Captain of Light Horse, and William Retrosi, Lieutenant and Captain Honorat in Patma: That he had judged it necessary to open himself without reserve to these nine Persons, who he had chosen, with such Caution, that he would pawn himself for their Flelity; That during his abode in the Camp they had gained above
two hundred Officers; That to these Officers he only intimated, that the Ambassador had ordered him to endeavour to be ready in Venice to rescue his Excellency from the fury of the People, whensoever he should have occasion: That since his return, he had received advice of the just number of Men, they might rely upon; and that they did not proceed, but upon methods very certain: That they depend on two thousand at the least of the Troops of Leivestein, besides three hundred of those of Nassaw; and that their Officers were all ready to deposite their Persons as Hostages for their Fidelity: That at the begining of the Negoti∣ation, they had flattered their Soldiers with the hopes of leading them upon some Expedi∣tion, when they should be dismist the Service of the Republick, which should abundantly recompence the miseries they had sustained: That it was not to be suspected that the singu∣larity of the Enterprize would discourage them, whensoever it should be necessary to publish it; That they were incenst to that de∣gree against the Senate, upon the score of the ignominious Treatment they had received, that he did avow, that single reason was suf∣ficient to incite them to any seasible Design for their Revenge: But that however, for better concealment, they would not declare, if they thought it fit, until matters were so
advanced that there would be scarce any doubt of the success; and that, upon the Resolution they had taken of exposing the City to be Plundered, there would not be found one sin∣gle Person scrupulous of enriching himself, by a way so sure and ready, and of spending the rest of his Life in ease and plenty. The Marquis of Bedamar, from the first thoughts he had conceived of this Enterprize, resolved by no means to engage but upon a sure prospect of much more means than would be necessary to the effecting it; and that these also should be so independent and disingaged, that the failure of either should in no sort in∣fluence the remaining Expedients: hereupon he omitted not to take his measures with the Duke of Ossuna, for a supply of Men, albeit he was in no doubt of Don Pedro's complement, or of Renaults success, in his understanding with the Hollanders Officers. He having treat∣ed upon each of these three Points with such prospect of security, as implyed not the least Assurance from either two, and as though they were to result in three different Enterprizes. It now imported to know precisely in what time the Duke of Ossuna would be able to put into Venice the Men he demanded; but that Duke not always taking so certain measures as to beget an implicite relyance on a naked Promise in a matter of so great importance as
well as difficulty, it became needful to dispatch a Person that should be capable to Judge upon the place, how far he was able to comply with his word. The Captain could not be absent from Venice unremarkt, and Renaults presence was indispensably necessary; they therefore re∣solved Bribe should be their Envoy, one of the French Gentlemen, with whom Renault had negotiated at Friol: But this Gentleman ha∣ving received Commission from the Republick to raise Soldiers during his preparation for his Journey, they concluded it of more use that he should prosecute that Imployment, and re∣solved upon one Laurence Nolot, a French Comptoi's, the said Captains Comrade, who departed upon Newyears day 1618. The Marquis of Bedamar thought it also now high time to explain himself with the Spanish Council; To anticipate therefore their own demand of being enlightned in the Affair, he sends them his Project the most intelligible and circumstantiat he was able: And whereas he was well acquainted with the slow delibera∣tions of that Court, he protested, by a speci∣al dispatch to the Duke of Lerma, that he would have an Answer speedy and decisive; and that the danger in which he was, made it just to explain himself in those absolute terms; and that in case they detained his Courier a∣bove eight days, he would interpret the re∣tardment
as an Order wholly to desist. He recei∣ved an Answer within the time he demanded, howbeit not so full & determinate as he hoped: They signified that in case he should incur dan∣ger by delay, that then he might proceed; but, if it were possible, they passionately desired to have first before them a faithful and ample State of the Republick. The Ambassador being prepared for that Subject, was not long in providing a Relation so exquisite, that the the Spaniards called it the Master-piece of their Politicks. It was not known upon what Design he framed it; howbeit, such as have seen it find nothing therein that is not ad∣justed to the Design. It begins with an Elo∣quent complaint of the difficulty of that Work by reason of the profound secrecy of the Go∣vernment he was to describe; he then falls upon encomiums of that Government; but the Elogy he made, regarded more the first Age of the Republick, than the present State. From their praises he falls upon a general Dis∣course, equally sad and elegant, of the de∣plorable Condition of humane things, where∣of the most excellent are most incident to Corruption; so the wisest Laws of that State by the abuse they had suffered, had been the Original Causes of its present Deformity: That, that of her Laws, which intirely ex∣cludes the people from gnizance in Affairs,
had introduced a Tyranny of the Nobles; and that which subjected the Ecclesiastical Power to the Censure of the Soveraign Magi∣strate, was the foundation of that loosness of the People of Venice in relation to the Court of Rome, since the contest of the Republick with that Court: He Illustrates that loosness by the Impiety it was reported the Hollanders committed with impunity in Fryol; and parti∣cularly declaims against their having buried a Person of Quality of their Nation, named Reynold Brederode, in the Church of the Ser∣vites of Venice, notwithstanding he was a Calvinist. In that Article he takes occasion gravely to tax Fra. Paoblo, without mention of his Name, for that it was he that inspired the Senate with that Resolution. He won∣dred how the People, being no longer tyed to their Obedience to their Prince by the Obli∣gations of Religion, violated so many ways to their Faces, could yet support the dreadful Vex∣ations they lay under. He minutely represented their Grievances, and without exaggeration made them appear intolerable. He proceeded to discover to them, That neither the Honour nor the Lives of the People were less at the dis∣cretion of their Masters than their Estates; and that the Genious of the Nation being led as it was to Lust, Avarice, and Revenge, it is no wonder if those that live under a Go∣vernment
of that nature should be opprest by their Masters. In fine, he examined the State of their Senate, of their Provinces, and Armies. In their Senate he remarkt Faction, and Division; he scrupled not to observe to them the discontents of many of their No∣bles; he represented the desolation of some of their Provinces by the Cruel War with the Ʋscocks, and the poverty of others by contribu∣ting to their Succor: That they had not three Officers paid in any of their Garrisons of Lom∣bardy, and that the Republick preserved her Authority from the only reason of no bodies moving to usurp it. As to their Armie, he made a faithful Relation of the several Muti∣nies in that by Land; and how they had dis∣persed the Factious in so great numbers, that the remainder was not to be considered but as a Rabble of an useless miserable Militia, with∣out either Courage, Experience or Discipline. As to their Naval Forces, they were become of late the Sanctuary of all the most infamous Pyrates of the Mediterranean; People un∣worthy the Name of Soldiers, and of whose Service the Republick could no longer make any account, than whilst they wanted power to be able to turn their Arms against her self. After having made this description with such Beauty of Language, and with so mar∣velous
a vigour of Expression, he examined what judgment ought to be made thereupon of the future State of that Republick, her Fortune, and Duration; and made it evident, and deducible from the principles he had laid down, that it was now languishing; and that the Disease was such as admitted no Crisis or amendment of the present Constitution, but by an intire reformation. Upon this Relation, the Council of Spain set the Marquis of Bedamar at intire Liberty to proceed, without tying him up to any In∣structions: And now Nolots delay, who was not yet returned, was the only clog to the business; and the Ambassador could not for∣give himself the error he had committed in exposing an Affair of that Nature to the Ca∣pricio of the Duke of Ossuna, in whose tem∣per so ancient an Experience ought to have instructed him: delay being mortal in the pre∣sent conjuncture. After the Spaniards had taken Versel, Gra∣disque became extreamly straitned by the Venetians; and the Council of Spain found no expedient for its Safety but the renewing propositions of Peace: There was therefore publisht by Agreement at Madrid, a Writing containing the principal Articles; but the con∣tinual disorders of the Duke of Ossuna obli∣ged the Venetians to revoke the Powers
they had given their Ambassador, and to transfer the Negotiation to France, where the Death of the Mareshal d'Ancre, had given them greater Hopes of Favour. The Peace was at length concluded the 6th of September, and the Governor of Milan held Conference some time after with Count Bethune at Pavia, in Order to the Execution thereof, in Relation to the Duke of Savoy: But at the same time the Governor omittednot to molest the Venetians, taking several places of theirs in Lombardy; whereof they made ge∣neral complaint, and were making greater preparations for War than ever, until the Marquis of Bedamar complemented them upon the Peace in full Senate, and promised punctu∣al Execution of the respective Articles: which he did, not so much in Obedience to his Or∣ders from Spain, as from a willingness to wipe out those Ill Impressions the Senate had taken of him in Relation to things past: Upon which consideration he acquitted himself of that Duty with all the Ardour and Demon∣strations of Joy and Friendship imaginable; and the Venetians, that but too much wisht what he had promised, blindly acquiesce and accord to a Suspension of Arms; which sus∣pension was a cutting blow of the Spaniarsd, and the Master-pice of their Ambassad or. Cradisque was at that time straitned to a de∣gree
of not being able to hold out fifteen days, and in the mean time Hostilities were yet to continue for the space of two Months; which time was Judged sufficient to perfect all Ra∣tifications, and to dispose things for Execu∣tion of the Treaty. It was a point of great Importance that the Town should not yield within that space; The Suspension therefore put it out of danger. And now the Spaniards, whose Motive not being so strong to press the Execution of the Treaty, were at Liberty to protract and spin out the time as should best suit with their Designs: Howbeit, the Duke of Ossuna, compelled by Orders from Madrid, and at the Popes Instance, offered some short time after, to make Restitution of the Vessels he had taken; but for their Merchandize, he knew not how it had been disposed of; not∣withstanding at the same time they were ex∣posed to Sale before the Face of the Venetian Resident, and a powerful New Fleet was at the same time fitted out to Cruize in the Adriatick. The Senate hereupon would have made complaint to the Marquis of Bedamar, which he anticipated by much greater of his own; declaring that he could not be accounta∣ble for the Actions of the Duke of Ossuna, and That the King himself, their Master, would not avow them; That amidst so many Fa∣vou and kind Treatments, he received du∣ring
his Ministry at Venice, The only displea∣sure he had conceived, was to find that they imputed the Conduct and Behaviour of that Duke wholly to his Counsels; wherein he ne∣ver had the least Share: That from the slen∣derest remarks upon the Duke of Ossuna might be easily collected, That he had no other Guide than his own Capricio; And as for his own part, they might also make a Judgment of his Temper and Disposition, from the Peaceable proceedings of the Governor of Milan, of whose preferment he gloried to have been the Author. It is true, That Governor exactly observed the Suspension; howbeit, he continued still in Arms, which to render the more plausible, he judged it needful to contrive new Disputes with the Duke of Savoy on pretext that the Troops dismist by that Prince, were still de∣tained in the Country of Vaux, to attend there the compleat Execution of the Treaty; Don Pedro therefore refused to the Count de Bethune to disarm, as had been accorded at Pa∣via; He also obliged the Duke of Mantua to the same Resolution, as far as it depended on him. The Count de Bethune publisht a Protest against them, and upon their refusal retired: Which Protest was Answered by the Marquis of Bedamar, in the most colourable Terms he could invent.
It may easily be judged by these Occurren∣ces of how much importance it was to hasten towards Execution, it being so difficult to preserve Affairs in a posture which gave so fair a promise of success. In the mean time, the Duke of Ossuna had not dispatcht Nolot; and the Ambassador on the point of despair, sent him Instructions to discover by all means possible, what should be the Cause; which in the End came to be un∣derstood. Some time after the Captain had been en∣tertained in the Venetian Service, the Duke, who would be instructed in the Affairs of Venice by variety of Methods, dispatcht after him an Italian, by Name Alexander Spinosa, who was to be a Spy on all Occurrences, and being a Stranger, was soon taken into Em∣ployment amongst the Crowd of other Soldi∣ers of Fortune that demanded it. He had a strong belief, that the Duke had some great Enterprize in Design, but did not suspect that the Corsair had been the Conductor of the Project: Howbeit, he doubted whether the Dukes displeasure lay so heavy on him as the World believed. Upon Spinosa's Arrival at Ve∣nice, he had offered to the Vice-King to Pony∣ard the Captain, which the Vice-King refused, from the danger he would run in the Executi∣on. Spinosa was a Man of Wit, and being ac∣quainted
with the Duke, Judged, That in Case he had no stronger Motive of refusal, the hazard of one Mans Life could be no retard∣ment to his Revenge: Nevertheless the Duke gave him in Charge to observe the Actions of the Corsair; which he did either to amuse Spinosa, or that the Vice-King was of those that intirely confided in no body, and was willing to mark, how far Spinosa's Account of the Captain, agreed with the Captains own Letters. Spinosa the better to acquit him of his Com∣mission, mixes himself with several French Men he had formerly known at Naples, and much frequented the Captain at Venice: These be∣ing of the Conspiracy, rendred an exact Ac∣count to the Captain of Spinosa's Disquisiti∣ons upon his Conduct; They also discovered, that this Spy traced some Design of his own, and was debauching People into the Service of the Duke of Ossuna. The Captain was in great Indignation, that the Duke scrupled to have an intire confidence in him; howbeit, was not at all surprized: He only considered that in case Spinosa should continue to Cabal, unless they had an under∣standing together, he could infeeble their Party by dividing it, and there would be no prudent declaring himself to one that had Commissi∣on to be a Spy upon him.
The Marquis of Bedamar, and Renault, Judged also that they could not spare much time in providing a remedy to this Inconveni∣ence, and after mature Conference upon the point, concluded there could be no security for them, but in Spinosa's Death: He was one that would sell his Life dear, in Case of an Attempt to assassin him; his Profession keeping him in a continual Posture of defence; And the Captain was at last reduced to im∣peach him to the Council of Ten, as a Spy of the Duke of Ossuna's, after having essayed in vain all other means for his destruction. The French Men with whom he had had Conversation, framed their Depositions so Judiciously, and Circumstantially, that he was apprehended, and privatly Strangled the same day; all that he could exhibit to the Judges, in prejudice of the Captain, being invalid, as proceeding from his Accuser, and not being a∣ble to prove any thing he depos'd. This Affair exceedingly augmented the Captains Reputation with the Venetians, but was a sensible Affliction to the Marquis of Be∣damar, as being a useful intimation to them to observe more strictly the Conduct of the Strangers entertained in their Service. The Duke of Ossuna learnt Spinosa's Death upon Nolot's Arrivalt Naples, and was not long in guessing at the Author. The dis∣pleasure
he conceived thereat, was exprest in his resentment to the Marquis of Bedamar, that he had not given him some advice thereupon; and the divers Reflections this accident crea∣ted in his Spirit, reduced him to Terms of the greatest uncertainty what to resolve on. In the mean time the Troops of Leivestein ha∣ving mutined anew, were by Order of the Senate, led to the Lazaretto about two Miles from Venice in the beginning of February. The Marquis of Bedamar, fearing they might come to an accord with the Republick touch∣ing their Pay, and that thereupon they should be compelled to depart, wrought with some of their Officers, that they should refuse the Terms were then offered them, to improve the favourable occasion of the vicinity of these Troops. Nolot was charged by an Express, to re∣present to the Vice-King, that within the Term of that Month, they should have near 5000 Men at their Devotion. Nolot forgot nothing of his Duty, but the Vice-King, who had not yet perfectly dige∣sted his Choler, amused him so long, that af∣ter six weeks expectation, the Officers fearing lest the Soldiers should be reduced by their ill Accommodation, to Treat without them; came themselves to an Agreement by consent of the Conspirators, who could find no Ex∣pedient
to prevent it. Ten days after No∣lot arrived with the Dukes Resolution, such as they could wish, but addrest to Robert Bru∣lard, one of the Captain's Comrades; but the Ambassador and the Captain being vigorously intent upon the Issue of their Intrigue, ex∣prest not the least Concern at the Affront the Duke did them in that Address. He advised, That he was now able whensoever they should desire it, to supply them with Barks, Brigan∣tines & other small Vessels, adjusted to the Ports and Channels of Venice, and in number capa∣ble to receive 6000 Men if it were needful: Nolot had viewed the Troops and Vessels, which were all in a ready Posture, and the Captain Ordered the Sounding of the several Depths of Water in the Ports and Channels that were to Conduct them to the Place of St. Mark, where they were to Land: for he having store of Seamen at his Devotion, by reason of his Command, they without suspi∣cion, had free Passage to and fro through the several Channels as often as they pleased; by which means it was very easy to take all ne∣cessary Measures most exactly. There only now rested how to prevent the departure of Lievesteins Troops, which to effect, there was no want of Money; the rigour also of the Season, was a resonable colour for their delay; the greatest p remained still at the
Lazaretto, and such as had embarkt before Nolot's Arrival, were entertained in several places at hand. To relieve Renault and the Captain, amidst the Cares of this business (which now grew too heavy for them to support) it was conclu∣ded necessary, to take in eighteen more at least, Men of Courage and Understanding, and such on whom they might intirely rely: They composed this number, of nine of those with whom Renault had dealt at Friol, and of the principal of those that the Captain had invited from Naples; they were five Captains of Vessels like himself, viz. Vincent Robert of Marseilles, Laurence Nolot, and Robert Bru∣lard (of whom mention hath been made al∣ready) the two last French Comptoi's, also one Laurence Brulard, and a Provincal, named Authony Jaffier: there were also two Brothers Lorrainers, Charles and John Boleau, and an Italian named John Rizzardo; (these three were excellent Petardiers) together with a French Man called Anglade, who had the Re∣pute of one of the ablest Fire-Masters of his time. The capacity of this last was so remarkable, that he had quickly obtained Liberty to pra∣ctice in his Profession in the Arsenal, and by that means the two Ptardiers his Comrades had free Entry: Besid these already menti∣oned,
there was one Villa Mezzana, and Re∣trosi, who were of those that Renault had gained, and that had had imployment in time past: These six drew so exact a Plot of the Design, that those that had never been upon the place, might have discoursed there∣upon as Judiciously, as those that Framed it. These received also much Assistance in their Business, from two Officers of the Arsenal, that the Captain had drawn in; they had ap∣peared to him dissatisfyed with their Imploy∣ment; were furnisht with Qualities pro∣per for his Design, capable of engaging, if con∣vinced of their Interest, and of complying faithfully, with whatsoever they should Pro∣mise: The Issue applauded the Judgment he had made, & he so seasoned his Complements to them (which he exprest on all occasions with a considerable number of Spanish Pistols, which he had by him to distribute) that they became charmed in a perfect Obedience to all he could command them. L'Anglade, and these two, had their Quar∣ters in the Arsenal; Renault had taken with himself to the Ambassadors of France, three of his Friends, Bribe, Brainville, and Laurence Brulard; the three Petardiers remained at the Marquis of Bedamars, who furnished them with Powder and other Materials and Instru∣ments necessary to employ them in their Pro∣fession,
but without ever having any Commu∣nication with them: they had already made more Petards and Fire-Works, than they should want; and the Ambassadors Palace was so filled, that it was not capable of Lodg∣ing more: The Captain remained at his Or∣dinary Quarters, but alone, to prevent su∣spicion in case he should be observed: And for the rest, he had lodged them at the Cur∣tizans, where he and Renault had their first Encounter. The Esteem and Friendship that succeded the Love they had had for that Wo∣man, but especially the Knowledg they had of her Adventure, gave them assurance they could not make a better Choice: She was of an Island of the Greeks, in the Archipelago; and of Condition as Noble as was possible in a Country under the Government of Venice. He that Commanded there for the Republick, had it seems Debaucht her upon some great Promises, and afterwards caused her Father to be assassined, for endeavouring to oblige him to comply with his Promise: The Woman thereupon, transported her self to Venice, to demand Justice of the Murder; but to no purpose, and having in the pursuit spent the little she had, her Beauty repaired now the mi∣sery it had occasioned. People of Noble extraction still form their resentments proportioned to their Quality,
when reduced to Professions unworthy their Birth; She therefore became Ravisht upon her first notice of the Project of those two Friends, and without reluctancy hazarded all in their Favour, and thereupon she hires one of the lar∣gest Houses of the Town, and under colour of some Work was first to be done, removes but part of her Goods, to the end she might have a reasonable Pretext of still keeping possession of both, being not far asunder. It was in these two Houses, that eleven of the Principal Conspirators had their Residence near six Months, and as she had freely recei∣ved Visits before from whatsoever Pleasant People, Strangers or Venetians occasionally frequented her House; Yet now, lest so great a concourse should expose her Guests to too much Observation, for more security, she feigned her self Indisposed. Whosoever has observed with what respect Women of that Profession are Treated in Ita∣ly, will easily conclude, That her House by this means became most obscure and solitary to all that had not business thither: The Con∣spirators never went abroad but by Night, and to the end they might have that at liberty, they held their Assemblies by day, in which Assem∣blies Renault and the Captain proposed such matters as had been debated with the Mar∣quis de Bedamar, wherein the Opinion of the
Company was consulted together with their Resolutions upon the Methods of Executing them. Whensoever it imported them to visit the Ambassador, they performed it with all re∣quisite Circumspection in a Country and a Conjuncture where Ambassadors Houses were watched and observed, as if they had been so many Enemies; and this more especially. It had been a standing Resolution among them, that it would be necessary to receive and conceal about a thousand Men in the Ci∣ty, before they came to Execution; But be∣cause it would be dangerous to introduce them with their Arms; The Marquis of Be∣damar had made Provision of Arms for more than 500 Men, nor was there much difficulty in doing this with a perfect security, in regard Ambassadors Gondola's were exempt from Vi∣sits of Officers, from wheresoever they should come; and therefore nothing now remained, but a fit occasion to introduce the 1000 Men into the City without exposing them to obser∣vation. The Doge Donato died, and they had cho∣sen in his stead, Anthony Priuli, whose Resi∣dence was at that time at Friol, in Order to the due Execution of the Treaty. The Ge∣neral by Sea had Order to wait upon him with the Naval Army; the Grand Chancellor and
Secretaries of State were to be more early than the rest in their Addresses to present him with the Ducal Bonnet; Twelve of the Principal Secretaries were to follow as Ambassadors of the Republick, every one by himself, in a Brigantine Armed and magnificently equipt with a Noble Attendance; The Senate it self was to go in a Body, and receive him far at Sea upon the Bucentaur, and Conduct him to the City with all that Pomp: Now because it rarely happens that their Dukes upon their Election are absent from the City, that Cere∣mony had drawn together an infinite number of curious People. The Marquis of Bedamar, that soresaw all this, upon the first notice of the Election of Priuli, sent Nolot a second time to Naples, with Order to get dispatcht in his presence, & with all possible diligence, the Brigantines, &c. of the Duke of Ossuna; and to prevent all Colour for delay, The Captain had in Charge to present the Duke with an exact Plot or Project of the Execution, and above all, to account to him what had happened at Venice, during Nolots first Voyage. The Captain therefore refines upon that Precaution, and being willing to deal with the Vice-kings humour, by variety of Me∣thods, represented That they had not concei∣ved the least reason of Complaint against his
Excellency, finishing his Address with these words: I accuse the negligence of Nolot, for so te∣dious a delay at Naples; for I cannot doubt, but if he had made just Representation of Af∣fairs, your Excellency had quickned his di∣spatch; He must needs therefore, have made demand of mony, or something equivalent; howbeit, he had express Orders to the Con∣trary: And I do engage to hold Venice yet six Months in my Power, if it be necessary, to attend your Excellencies great effect; provi∣ded, you dispatch away the Brigantines, up∣on Nolots Arrival, with the 6000 Men you have offered. This Letter is of the 7th. of April being the day of Nolots departure. In the mean time, Renault brought into Venice all the Officers of the Troops they had gained, that they might Survey the City, and acquaint themselves with their respective Posts, to the end there might be no disorder, when they should come to Execution. Before they departed, they had made choice of 1000 Men out of the Hollands Troops, to be ready to March at day-break; and that the absence of this 1000 Men might be less remarkable, they cautiously pick them out here and there, as they lay dispersed about the Country: And the better to accommodate this number every
single Officer hired what Lodgings he could, without giving occasion of suspicion, telling their Hosts they were for Strangers that came to see the Solemnity; and as to the Officers, they conceal'd themselves among the Curti∣zans, where, upon Terms of good payment, they were more secure than they could be else∣where. There remained nothing now, but to frame a Scheme of the Execution, which the Mar∣quis of Bedamar, Renault, and the Captain, concluded together should be as follows. Upon the close of the Evening, those of the 1000 Soldiers, that were come un-Armed, should repair and furnish themselves at the Ambassadors, 500 of them should draw up in the place of St. Mark, to be headed by the Captain: The best part of the remaining five hundred should joyn with Renault, near the Arsenal; and the rest should possess themselves of all the Barks, Gondolas, and other like Vessels at the Rialto; with these they should hasten with all diligence to tran∣sport near 1000 Soldiers more of the Troops of Leivestein, that were still at the Lazarerto: du∣ring which Passage they should Govern them∣selves with all the silence imaginable; to the end they might not give the Alarum till that Party should be joyn Howbeit, in case of necessity, and that they should perceive them∣selves
to be discovered, then the Captain should Retrench himself in the place of St. Mark; Renault should make himself Master of the Arsenal, as shall be described: and upon fi∣ring two pieces of Canon, (which shall be for a Signal to the Brigantines of the Duke of Ossuna, that were to be in readiness to enter the Port;) The Spaniards then should supply the want of the Troops that were to be tran∣sported. In case they should not be obliged to de∣clare during their Passage, then, upon the Landing of the Hollands Soldiers, at the place of St. Mark, the Captain should joyn 500 of those to the 500 he had with him, which the Serjeant-Major Durand should command; which 1000 Men should be ranged in Battalia in the place, whilst the Captain with 200 should possess himself of the Ducal Palace, and especially of the Armory that was there; as well to furnish their own Wants, as to pre∣vent the Enemies supply. 100 others, under the Conduct of Bribe, should make themselves Masters of the Secque; and another 100 un∣der Brainville, of the Procuratie, by the Assi∣stance of a Party they should warily intro∣duce into the Bell-Tower the same day: These last should remain as a Corps of Guard in the Tower, during the Progress of the Enter∣prize, to the End they might not toll the
Alarum. The Entries of all the Streets should also be defended by Corps of Guard, where they should also have Artillery planted to Command the Streets; and till they could be supplied out of the Arsenal, they should take some out of the Gallyfoist of the Council of Ten, which was near at hand, and would re∣quire no difficulty to seize. In all the places they surpriz'd, and where∣in they placed Corps of Guard, they should put every Man to the Sword; and during these divers Methods of Execution, round about St. Marks Place, the Serjeant-Major should continue in Battalia in the midst, with the rest of the Troops. All this Progress shall be made with the least noise possible. Then they may begin to give the Alarum, by applying the Petards to the Gates of the Ar∣senal: upon which noise, the eight Conspi∣rators, that had laid down the Draught, and that shall be within, shall apply fire in several places thereof, by the help of the Artificial Fire-Works they had prepared for that pur∣pose at the Ambassadors, as they had the Pe∣tards: and then they shall Ponyard the Prin∣cipal Officers. Herein there will be no difficulty, in the Confusion which the Fire and the Noise of the Petards will bring amongst them; especially they not being suspected by their Officers.
They shall afterwards joyn with Renault, upon whose Entry, they shall put all to the Sword; and the Soldiers then shall transport the Ar∣tillery to the several places of Importance a∣bout the Town. viz. at Arena de Mari, to the Fontego de Redeschi, to the Magazins, to the Clock-Tower of the Procuratie, to the Ryal∣to, and other Eminencies, from whence they might be able to batter the Town to Ruines, in case of Resistance. Whilst Renault is attempt∣ing the Arsenol, the Captain shall force the Prison of St. Mark, giving Arms to the Prisoners, killing also the Principal Senators: and such as are appointed shall set the Town on Fire in above forty several Places, the most remote one from another that might be, to be∣get the greater Consternation. In the mean time, the Duke of Ossuna's Party of Spaniards, having understood the Signal which shall be given upon Mastering the Arsenal, will Arrive, and Land also at the Place of St. Mark, dispersing themselves im∣mediately into all the Principal Quarters of the City, viz. St. Georges, the Jews Quar∣ter, and others under the Conduct of the nine other head-Conspirators; whilst nothing shall be Proclaimed but Liberty. And after Execution of these Orders, the Pillage shall be free; empting only Stran∣gers, from whom nothing shall be Plundered,
on pain of Death; refusing Mercy to none but to such as shall resist. Nolot found things in so prosperous condi∣tion upon his Arrival at Naples, That the 6000 Men Embarkt the next day, under Con∣duct of one Elliot an English Man. To pre∣vent all occasion of Suspition, the Duke of Ossuna Ordered his great Fleet to fetch a very large Compass before they stood their true Course; but he dispatcht Elliot and the Bri∣gantines by a shorter Cut. Upon the second day of their departure this little Fleet meets with a Squadron of Py∣rats of Barbary, which attacque them; and they being rather equipt for the convenient Carriage and Accommodation of their Soldi∣ers, than for a Battle, were extreamly prest by the Moors Artillery, whose Vessels were Yarer and better Armed: And notwithstand∣ing the great numbers of People that were crowded on Board those of Naples, much in∣commoded them in their defence: yet, being all choice Spaniards, they would have given the Enemy so brisk an Attacque with their Swords, whensoever they had Boarded, that the Pyrats would possibly have repented their having obstructed their Voyage, but a violent Storm came up and separated them in the heat of their Engagement.
The little Fleet was so Shattered, that they would not be in Condition to put to Sea again in some time; And the Marquis of Bedamar, upon advice hereof, finding he could not pre∣vent the Solemnity they were preparing at Venice, assisted there in Person, in a more Splendid manner than any body: He protest∣ed in a full Assembly of the Senate, making his Complement to the New Duke, That the particular Joy he had expressed at his Exalta∣tion, sprung from an assurance that his Sere∣nity would retain upon the Throne, the same favourable inclinations towards the accom∣plishment of the Peace he had so lately ex∣prest at Friol. After this Audience, he sent to Renault & the Captain, of whom he immediately demanded if they judged it necessary wholly to decline the Enterprize? To which, they replied, That they were not only on the contrary Opinion, but that none of their Companions had disco∣vered less Constancy upon the disgrace of the Fleet, than if they had Arrived in safety; and that they were generally disposed to take all necessary measures to preserve their Party in the best Posture, in expectation of some more favourable Conjuncture. The Ambassador, who had made this Pro∣position with much Reluctancy, upon their Answer embraced them with Tears of Joy
in his Eyes; and told them (with a freedom so Emphatical as would have fortified the weakest heart, and inspired with Courage and Bravery the most affrighted Spirit) That great Revolutions, which in Vulgar Affairs are Subjects of Surprize, are the Natural and Common Contingencies of extraordinary En∣terprizes: That these are the only Tryals of our Fortitude; and We are then only capable to conclude our selves qualified for great De∣signs, when we have once stood the Shock of a Defeat with Constancy and Tranquillity. Hereupon, it was resolved between the Mar∣quis and his two Confidents, That the Execu∣tion should be Respited until the Feast of A∣scension, which was not far off, and was the greatest Solemnity of Venice: That in the mean time, they should continue the Troops in their respective Quarters, by furnishing them with all the Conveniences they could de∣sire; and That there should be no want of mo∣ny to be distributed amongst the Officers for that purpose: That of 300 of them, which were received into Venice, they should detain the Principal among them as Hostages for the Fidelity of the rest, and return the inferior Officers to their respective Commands; as well to preserve the Soldiers in their Obedi∣ence, as to lessen the number in the Town; lest so many Officers should minister occasion
of Suspicion. That they should provide the the most agreeable Entertainments and Di∣versions they could for those that remained, for their amusement: and to the end they might not be at leisure if it were possible to make reflection upon the present Posture of Affairs; That the twenty principal Conspira∣tors should have a watchful Eye upon their Motions and Behaviour, and to oblige the Republick to consent to the retardment of the Troops of Leivestein, & not yet to dismiss those of Nassaw. The Governor of Milan, and Vice-King of Naples forbore to put in Exe∣cution the late Treaty of Peace. All that humane Wit could contrive of pretext and apology to oppose against Reason, was sug∣gested by the Marquis of Bedamar, and put in Execution by Don Pedro, and the Duke of Ossuna: howbeit, they were constrained to make daily some advance towards the Peace, in spite of their Aversion. The Council of Spain durst not hazard any thing upon their hopes of success in a Trans∣action so doubtful, as that of the Conspiracy. And France being resolved to avow the Trea∣ty of Paris, obliged the Venetians to agree that the Duke of Savoy should dismiss the Troops he had detained in the Country of Vaux, and that served  a Pretext to Don Pedro's slow motions. This difficulty being
removed, the Marquis of Bedamar thinking to make that Prince to decline Restitution of the Places he had taken in Mountferrat, caused a Rumour to be spread, That assoon as the Duke of Mantua should be reestablisht, he would dispose of that State to the Spani∣ards. At the same time Don Pedro studies an unreasonable Quarrel, with a Minister of the Duke of Savoy's that had accompanied the French Ambassador to Milan, Ordering his de∣parture thence. The Duke, incensed at this Injury, recals them to his own Court, and thereupon put a stop to the restoring of the places he possest: But the Ambassadors obvia∣ting to him, how he was hastning into the Snare Don Pedro had laid for him, prevailed upon him to deliver up at once all the Places he had taken. Don Pedro was so astonisht at this News, that he was not able to conceal his Surprize, even in his publick Discourses. And hereupon it became necessary that he should re∣lease his Prisoners, and deliver up the lesser places; but as touching Verseil, which was the Essential Point, he made so strange diffi∣culties therein that they threatned him from Spain to recal him before the ordinary time. To which he replied, That it would be a disho∣nour for him to restore that Place during the French Ambassado abode at Milan, whose presence would seem to Awe him to that
Complement; they therefore retire: and he then declares, That the Duke of Savoy ought first to make Restitution for certain Lands that appertained to some of the Duke of Mantua's Subjects; those Lands were therefore relin∣quisht; but Verseil was not yet restored. In Conclusion, France being willing to make a Match between Madam Christina the Kings Sister, and the Prince of Piedmont (whereup∣on it was accorded decisively, touching that Place) Don Pedro began now by withdrawing his Ammunition and Artillery he had there, but with most incredible protraction. The Marquis of Bedamar, injoyning him to a yet greater delay, insinuated he should exact new Assurances of the Duke of Savoy, in favour of the Duke of Mantua. But the Ministers themselves of Mantua declared by a Manifesto made publick in writing, That they did not demand those Assurances: How ill soe∣ver the Marquis Bedamar relisht this Declara∣tion, the Conduct of the Duke of Ossuna was much more distastful to him: for the Duke tired with the clamorous Complaints of the Venetians from all Parts, upon his continuing to molest the Navigation of the Gulph, and ha∣ving no other reply to make, Answered; That he would not be drawn to desist, whilst the Venetians entertained in their Service, the most implacable Enemies of the King his
Master. 'Tis not hard to make a Judgment by the endeavors of the Ambassadour, to detain the Hollands Troops (the subject of the Dukes Complaint) with what despair he learnt this Answer of the Duke: He did not doubt but the Senate that courted Peace at any Rate, would dismiss them, to leave the Duke with∣out excuse. But the Issue once more deceived the Prudence of the Marquis of Bedamar: Some Spirit, indulgent to the extravagancies of the Duke of Ossuna, compelled the Veneti∣ans to a Resolution thereupon directly contra∣ry both to their Interest and Inclination. It was remonstrated to the Senate, That the Re∣publick had but too much already betrayed their Inclinations for Peace, in all their pro∣ceedings, and which had indeed been the ground of so much Phlegme in the Spanish Ministers: and if they should be led to accord also to this last instance of the Vice-King, he would be thought to give Laws to Venice, and that, instead of dismissing the Hollands Troops, it imported rather to detain the Troops of Leivestein, that were upon depar∣ture, in Order to the intire Execution of the Articles of Peace. The Joy the Marquis of Bedamar conceived at this Resolution, was somewhat allayed up∣on the discovery of the Complot at Crema: The Ensign, Provencal, and the Italian Cap∣tain,
that had been gained, falling out at Play; the Quarrel came to a Duel, wherein the Captain was mortally wounded; who, to disburthen his Conscience, made confession of all at his Death to the Venetian Officer who commanded. The Ensign mistrusting the Issue, upon his wounding the Captain, betook him to Flight, together with such others of the Com∣plices as he had leisure to advertize: the rest were surprized; amongst which the French Lieutenant, who was the head of that Design. But whereas Renault had no correspondence with them but by an Agent who was a Mil∣lanese, and happened to be out of the way, this whole Design was imputed to Don Pedro. Eight days after this, the Serjeant Major, who had undertaken to deliver Maraw, having with-held for his own use some Profits accru∣ing to a Servant of the Commissaries, as also of a Pensioner of the Republick, these, en∣raged at their Loss, took occasion upon his absence, to enter into his House, break open his Coffers, and take away his Mony and Pa∣pers; among which were found Letters which made mention of the Design: How be∣it, he having no other light but from the Dukes Age, with whom he had Treated, he could accuse no body but the Duke; but he takes a nobler Resolution; he therefore in
the midst of his Torments replyed, That he was assured they would never save him though he should confess the naked Truth, and that he thought it better to leave to his Com∣panions, if he had any, to revenge his Death, than to betray them by a fruitless Confession. Publick thanksgivings were now performed in Venice for these two Discoveries, whilst the main Enterprize became by these accidents more prosperous than before The Senate at length concluding they had discovered the secret Cause of the Spaniards so irregular proceedings, and these two Plots being detected, they proposed to themselves a State of perfect Repose and Tranquillity, and an assurance of an intire consummation of the Treaty. In the mean Season, the time of Executi∣on draws near: After the Sunday that pre∣cedes the Ascension day until Pentecost, there is held in Venice one of the most famous Fairs in the World; the great concourse of Trading people could give no impediment to the sur∣prize of the Town, and would yield a fair opportunity of introducing the 1000 Soldi∣ers, who mixing themselves with the Mer∣chants, could enter and lodg themselves without being remarked: and it was easie to remove from the Venetian Towns wherein they were dispersed, in regard that some time
before such as had been most prest to retire home had disbanded themselves; and the Offi∣cers of the Town took now no further care, in consideration they were so many people that lived free of all Charge to the Republick. But, lest it should occasion any Surprize, that so great a number should now Disband in so short a time, the greatest part pretended at their departure they went to the Fair at Ve∣nice, disguising themselves under the Chara∣cters of all sorts of Professions: they observed to lodg themselves in Parties that spake dif∣ferent Languages, to the end the better to re∣move all suspicion of Intelligence; observing a strangeness and unacquaintance among themselves. The 500 Spaniards, destined to the Plot at Crema that was discovered, were sent at the same time into the Neighbourhood of Brescia, to possess themselves of that City upon the first intimation of success in the Conspiracy, and by favour of the Faction, that the Lieu∣tenant of the Count de Nassaw had formed there, and still held out. As to the Venetian Fleet, that was Harboured in Dalmatia, butin Condi∣tion to be able to put to Sea upon the first Sum∣mons, by reason of the Duke of Ossuna's un∣certain Motions. The Captain sent to the Commanders of the 12 Ships in his absence a sort of Fire-Works, very fierce, to distribute
secretly throughout the whole Fleet the Eve of the Execution. As no body had any cause to suspect those Officers, it was very easy to effect this, without the least observation: they were Ordered to adjust the measures of their Match, that their Fire-Works might take ef∣fect, if possible, in one and the same Mo∣ment; and that, in case any should escape, they should possess them by force of Arms, or sink them with their great Guns: That they should then make the best of their way to∣wards Venice, and there dispose themselves for a ready Execution of whatsoever Orders they should receive: Howbeit, they were to attend new Instructions. For the time of Execution, the day was appointed to be the Sunday before Ascen∣sion-day, which is the first of the Fair. The Duke of Ossuna had now so Ordered the Con∣duct of his little Fleet, that they Arrived, without any memorable Accident, within six Miles of Venice; It was ranged in two Squa∣drons, which were Ordered to keep some di∣stance in their Sailing, the better to prevent Observation: The principal was composed of Barks of the Built of Fisher-Boats, to ren∣der them less suspicious; the rest consisted of Brigantines, after the manner of Priva∣teers.
Upon the Satturday Morning Elliot received Orders to depart the next day, that he might arrive within View of the City upon the close of the Evening; That he should spread the Flag of Saint Mark; That he should possess himself of some small Islands, by which he must necessarily pass, being of no defence, and from whence possibly might be conveyed Intelligence of his Motions; That he should then boldly present himself before the two Castles of Lyde and Malamocco, for that they had no Garison within; and that he should make the best of his way between them; That he should advance to within Cannon-shot of the City, and should immediately advertise of his Arrival; and, upon the return of the Bark that should carry the Intelligence, the Captain would send them Pilots to Conduct them safe from the Shoals and Rocks, where∣with Venice is surrounded, and which render the Entry of the Ports impossible to those that are not well acquainted. Whereas the following day would be ne∣cessary to dispose things for Execution at Night, Renault and the Captain judged it ne∣cessary to hold a final Consultation the E∣vening before with the rest of the Complices; The Captain leaving to Renault to represent the true State of Affairs, and to give the ne∣cessary Advices therevpon: but with all their
diligence they could not have a full Meeting till it was almost Night. The Assembly consisted of the three French-Men that Quartered with Renault, the Lieu∣tenant of the Count de Nassaw, the three Pe∣tardiers, L' Anglade, the two Officers of the Arsenal; The Captain and Lieutenant that had been employed before Nolot, the two Brulards, Jaffier, Robert Theodore the Hollan∣der, The Savoyard that had been at the Escalade of Geneva, and the Engineer Revillido. These 20 Persons being met at the Greeks with Renault and the Captain; and having retired to the most secret Quarter of the House, after the necessary Cautions customary in these Meetings; Renault brake Silence: He began with a Narrative plain and particu∣lar of the present posture of Affairs, of the Forces of the Republick, and of their own; of the Dispositions of the City, and of the Fleet; of the preparations of Don Pedro and the Duke of Ossuna; of the Arms and other Provisions of War lodged at the Spanish Ambassadors; of the Intelligence they had in the Senate, and amongst the Nobles; in Conclusion, of the exact Measures they had taken touching all things that imported their enquiry. After having gained the approbation of his Auditory by this Recital, in the truth whereof they were all throughly informed, and where∣in
they had been equally concerned with him∣self, he continued his Discourse in the follow∣ing Terms. Thus my Companions, You have before you the means destined for your Conduct to the Glory you pursue; There is none of you but can judg if they are sufficient, and assured: We are secure of infallible Methods for introducing of 10000 Arm∣ed Men, into a City that cannot make 200 to Oppose us; and where the Plunder will invite to our Party all the Strangers that either Curiosity or Commerce hath brought amongst them; and where their very Subjects themselves will Assist us in dispoiling their Masters (who have often spoiled them) upon the least Prospect of Impunity. The principal Ships of their Fleet are at our Devotion, and the rest carry in their Bosoms what will quickly reduce them to Ashes: The Arsenal, that famous Arsenal, the wonder of Europe and ter∣ror of Asia! is as it were already in our Possession: The nine Brave Persons here
present, and that for the space of six months have had it in their Power to seiz it, have so well taken their Measures, du∣ring this retardment, that they conceive there will be no hazard in Answering on Peril of their Heads, to render themselvs Masters thereof; and though we should sail both of the Troops of the Lazaretto, and those of the Continent, of Elliots lit∣tle Fleet, and the 500 Men from Don Pedro, of the 20 Venetian Ships, of our Companion, the great Ships of the Duke of Ossuna, and the Spanish Army in Lombardy, We should yet be strong e∣nough with the Intelligence we have, and the 1000 Men that are Introduced: how∣beit all these different supplies that have been recited are so contrived, that either may fail without bringing the least da∣mage to the rest; they may exceedingly fortify each other by their help, but can never annoy. It is almost impossible that they should not all take effect, and one alone is sufficient. That after having practised all the Caution humane prudence can sug∣gest,
Judgment may be made of the suc∣cess Fortune hath destined us. What Te∣stimony now can we hope of her Favour, that would not fall short of those we have? Yes my Friends! They contain manifestly something of Prodigy: History has no Pre∣cedent of an Enterprize of this nature, where the discovery of a part has not de∣tected the whole; and ours hath stood the Tryal of five Accidents, wherein the least in all humane appearance, indangered Ruine: who would not have believed but the loss of Spinosa, who traced our steps, would have been our perdition? That the dismisssion of the Troops of Leiveistein that had all avowed our Service, had not disclosed what we held concealed? That the defeat of the little Fleet, had not broken all our Measures, and been a plen∣tiful Spring of new Mischiefs? That the discovery of Crema, and that of Maran, should not of necessity have discovered the whole Party? All these Accidents have occurred without effect▪ They have not pursued the Track that would have con∣ducted
them to us, nor have improved the hints they might have collected thence. Never did Repose so profound precede a Ca∣lamity so great: The Senate we are tho∣rowly instructed in; The Senate is in per∣fect Security: Our good Fortune hath blinded the most quick-sighted of all Man∣kind, fortified the most fearful, charmed the most suspectful, and confounded the most subtile. We are yet alive, my dear Friends, and more powerful than before these Dis∣asters, which have been the proofs only of our Constancy. We yet live, and our Life shall quickly prove fatal to these Tyrants: can a felici∣ty so extraordinary, so persevering, be na∣tural? Have we not some ground of pre∣sumption, that it is the Work of some Power exalted above the Common Level of humane thought? and indeed, my Friends, what can there be upon Earth, worthy Divine Protection, if what we un∣dertake doth not challenge it? We destroy the most detestable of all Governments,
and restore so many poor Subjects of the State that groan eternally under the Op∣pression of an Avaritious Nobility. We secure the Honour of so many Women as would one day be born under their Domini∣on, qualified for their Pleasure and Lux∣ury. We redeem an infinite number of miserable Wretches, which their Cruelty exposes a Sacrifice to their least resent∣ments upon the slendercst Motive: In a word, We punish the most Criminal of all Mankind, equally nurst up with Vices which Nature abhors, and with those she cannot suffer without Shame. Let us then without Reluctancy with Fire and Sword endeavour to extermi∣nate those Tyrants; and when we shall behold the Palace where Impicty sitson the Throne, flaming with a Fire, rather from Heaven than Ours, those Tribunals stained by the Tears and Sufferings of the Inno∣cent consumed by devouring Flames, The furious Soldier unsheathing his reaking Dagger from the Bosom of the Wretched, Death dispersed through all Quarters,
and all that the Night and a Soldiers fury can produce to compleat a spectacle of hor∣ror, let us then call to mind, my dear Friends, that there is nothing pure a∣mongst Men, that the most eligible things have the greatest allays; and to conclude, in exchange of the many Enormities under which this unfortunate Country labours, the Disorders of the approaching Night are the only means to Crown them with Peace, Justice, and Liberty for ever. This Discourse was received by the rest, with that approbation which we usually be∣stow on opinions suitable to our own; How∣beit Renault that studied their Faces, remarkt in Jaffier, one of the Captains most intimate Friends, a sudden transportment; from a most profound attention, to a disorder, which he endeavoured in vain to cover, something still remaining in his Looks of Sadness and Surprize; which betrayed a Spirit labouring under the most violent Reluctancy. This Renault observed to the Captain, who at first laught at his suspicion, but observing Jaffier with some diligence, became at length almost of the same Belief. Renault, that was a good Interpreter of the Faculties, and know how to value the secret
movements of the Soul from the least exterior hit that escapes upon any violent agitation of the Mind, having maturely considered what he had read in Jaffiers Countenance, thought it his Duty to declare to the Captain his Opi∣nion that he was not to be trusted. The Cap∣tain, who knew Jaffier to be one of the bra∣vest Men living, accused his Judgment of Vio∣lence and precipitation, but Renault obstinate in the Justification of his suspicion, explained himself with so Judicious Reason and Argu∣ment, that though the Captain was not so nearly touched as he, yet he was at least con∣vinced that Jaffier was a Man to be observed; but withal he replied to Renault that though Jaffier should be a little shaken, (which he could not tell how to believe) he would not have leisure enough by the Morrow to delibe∣rate upon his resolution of betraying them; But on the whole, that considering the posture into which their affairs were ripened, there was no room to resolve upon new Methods; and that they could not avoid embarking up∣on the Execution with all the hazard. Renault replyed, there was yet one certain way to secure them, and that was to Ponvard him themselves that Night; upon which Proposition the Captain remained some time in suspence, but in the end replyed, That he could not resolve on the death of one of his best
friends, upon the bare motive of suspicion; that a kind of Resolution might have very many evil Consequences; that he was tender of dis∣composing the minds of the rest, and becom∣ing odious to them; and considered as one that challenged an Empire over them; and pre∣tended a sovereign jurisdiction of life & death: That it was not to be hoped that they could comprehend so clearly the necessity of killing Jaffier as themselves did, and that not being so possest, each Conspirator could not but con∣sider with regret, his Life exposed upon the least hint, or imagination that should occur; And that since every Man was now under the most Violent agitations of Spirit, the slenderest Accident might occasion a Revolution, and that in such a posture of Affairs the least Change was of infinite importance, for that they had but the two extream Paths now to tread, that in case they should endeavour to conceal the Reason of Jaffier's absence, that would beget a worse suspicion, that he is dis∣covered, and either a Prisoner, or their Enemy; and what reason or pretext soever they could forge for his absence upon the Evening of the Execution, being appointed to so principal a Charge, it would not choose but much inti∣midate the rest, and suggest melancholly and doubtful apprehensions. Renault was atten∣tively harkning to the Captain's Discourse,
when one of their people entred the Room with an Order of the Senate which they had just received for the Embarking on the Mor∣row, all the Officers of the Fleet; bringing also with him a Note from the Spanish Am∣bassador, which explained to them the Rea∣son of their Embarking. The Duke of Ossuna could not Conceal his Departure so secretly from Naples to joyn with his great Fleet, but the Spies of the Re∣publick got the Wind of it: But he having left Order that no correspondence by Letter, or Courier, should be permitted with Venice till such a space of time; The Venetians had not till then got any Advice of his Departure. The Arch-Duke being newly elected King of Bohemia, had demanded Aids of the Duke against the Rebels of that Kingdom, which were drawing together about that time, and the Vice-King having Proclaimed that he would conduct these Succors by way of the Gulph, to some Port of the Arch-Dukes on the Coast of Istria, The Venetians had besought him by Mediation of the Prince himself, to take some other Course. But he who never governed himself by the currant Sentiments of the rest of Mankind, so soon as they had Intimation of his Departure, did not at all doubt but it had been an Order to the Con∣ducting those Succors in Person by the way he
had resolved: they were determined not to Dispute his Passage, which they might have done, because they would avoid all Occasions of a Breach: they concluded therefore only to dispatch their Fleet, with Order to he upon the Coast of Istria, where he was to disembark his Troops, to have an Eye upon his Motions, and to prevent the Temptation the Prospect of their Maritime Towns in his Passage might suggest. The firmest Resoluti∣on Man's Nature is capable of, springs for the most part from the strongest Imagination of the Danger he is to Incur, by Vertue of which Imagination, the Soul in the end be∣comes familiar with the Circumstances of that Danger, how srightful soever it might seem at first sight, after Duty considered; but also this steadiness of Resolution is so united to these Circumstances, that in Case any of them should chance to change upon the point of Execution, 'tis odds but it begets a wavering in our Resolutions also: This was what gave Renault and the Captain some apprehensions touching their Companions upon the occasi∣on of their Embarking so unexpectedly, upon the Venetian Fleet; Which News was very unwelcome, in that they conjectured there∣upon they should be constrained to alter some∣thing of the Method of proceeding as they had adjusted preparatory to the Execution of
their Enterprize; nor could they prevent it, by instantly Engaging, The Night being too far advanced, and it would be day ere they could give Advice to the little-Fleet, to Or∣der their approach to be within Cannon-Shot of the Town, in Order to the first Scene of the Tragedy, and before they could give In∣timation to the Troops at the Lazaretto. On the morrow the Venetian. Fleet was to Sail, and in Case they should Order Elliot to Advance, he would certainly be discovered by the Boats that would be all that day holding Correspon∣dence between the Fleet and the Town. The Course they were to steer proved the most fa∣vourable to the Conspirators they could wish, being directly contrary to Elliot's Station; and upon mature debate, it was concluded best to give them leisure till they were got a conve∣nient distance. The difficulty was, to Resolve whether the Captain L' Anglade, the three Petardiers, and the others that had Charge in the Fleet, should obey the Instructions of the Senate; Their Assistance was indispensably necessary at Venice, in Order to the Execution, and above all the Captains, howbeit, his ab∣sence from the Fleet appeared the greatest dif∣ficulty; The Character he had there, rendring him more conspicuous than al the other party, who having for the most part imployment in the Vessels in his own Squadron, he would
be able to supply the want of the rest by his single Authority, and prevent even the notice of their Absence. The Result of this Con∣ference was, That the Captain should Em∣barque with only L' Anglade, whose business together with that of the three Petardiers, de∣pended immediately on the General, howbeit they were resolved to run any hazard rather than permit their departure: the General upon the Captains coming aboard, demanded where they were? who replied he believ'd they had concealed themselves in Venice among the Cur∣tizans, together with other Officers of his Vessels which he could not find, and was so prest to his departure that he had not leisure to seek them. The Orders of the Senate were so peremptory for the Sailing of the Fleet, that the General had not leisure at first to consider upon sending to find them out, and now could less attend their fearch. Upon the Captains Embarking, he took Jaffier aside, particularly to Conjure him to fill his place near Renault upon the Night of Execution; he superadded the assurance they had in his Conduct and Courage, without which confi∣dence he had never been drawn to absent himself, and that he concluded his second-self remained with his Companions, whilst Jaffier was among them: during this Discourse the Captain observed him diligently, but he
charm'd with so many Testimonies of Esteem and Respect they had for him, replyed with so much appearance of Zeal, Fidelity, and Ac∣knowledgment, that would have confirmed the most suspicious Man living. But this was the last fit of his dying Resolution, which expired upon his Friends departure: and his absence, whose consideration alone could sup∣port him, now abandoned him wholly to his incertitude. The description Renault had made of the Night of Execution towards the end of his harangue, had so affected him, that he could no longer subdue his compassion, his Imagination added an Elegancy to the Picture, and described in the liveliest Colours all the Cruelties, and certain Violences, inci∣dent to such occasions; from that moment, his Ears were ever Assaulted with the Cries of Infants trampled under Foot, the Groans of old. Men expiring with their Wounds, the Shrieks of Ravisht Women; his Eyes behold nothing but Pallaces in Ruines, Temples in Flames, Holy places profaned, and Violated; Venice the sad, the deplorable Venice, was still in his View; no more the Triumphant as in time past, over the Ottaman Fortune, and the Spanish Insolence, but in Cinders, or in Ru∣ines; immerst more in the Blood of her In∣habitants, than in the Waters that surround her. This funest Image haunted him night
and Day, sollicited him, prest, and at length shook him: In vain he calls up his Courage to banish it, more obstinate than all the Poets furies; interrupting his Repast, troubling his Repose, and stealing into even his very Dreams. But to be∣tray all his Friends, and such friends! so brave! so prudent! so singular in the respective Talents wherein they excell'd! 'Twould be the work of many ages to unite again such a number of extra∣ordinary Men, at a conjuncture wherein they were upon rendring themselves memorable to the last posterity: Shall he eclipse the Glory of reaping the maturest Fruit, of the most exalted Resolution that hath been ever conceived by the Spirit of Man? And how shall they perish? by Torments more singular & exquisite than what all the Tyrants of of past Ages had ever invented? Who is ignorant that in Venice there is a sort of Prison more capa∣ble of shaking the strongest Resolution, than all the Pomp of the most frightful Executions of o∣ther Countries. These last reflections, which as∣saulted Jaffier upon his weak Side, reduced him to some reassurance. The concern he had enter∣tained for his Companions, had a little prevailed upon his pitty for the Desolation of Venice, and under these terms of irresolution he continued until the Feast of Ascension; to which time they had respited the Execution. On the Morning they received advice from the Captain, who assured them he would answer for the Fleet; That they
were bound towards Maran; and that at the same time they sent to the Lazaretto for the Troops of Lovestein, they should dispatch a Boat of Advice to him, which he would await in order to his attempting what was to be done on his part. They had now dispatcht to Elliot the Pilots they had promised: they had introduced into the Bell-Tower of the Procuratie of St. Mark the People that had been appointed to that Post, who being acquainted with those that held the Guard, should stupefy them with certain pre∣parations they had made, to mingle with their Meat and Drink, whereof by reason of the solem∣nity of the Feast they might oblige them to eat and drink plentifully. Orders were distributed to the respective Officers, they had chosen to at∣taque such of the Senators in their Houses as were most to be suspected, and kill them. To these each had his House assigned him, also every prin∣cipal Conspirator and Officer, had his Post ap∣pointed him, the number of Men he was to Command, and the Watch-Word accustomary: They had also sent orders to the Troops in the Lazaretto, and to the Spaniards in the little Fleet, explaining by what methods they should disperse themselves upon their Landing at the place of St. Mark, which was the general Rendezvouz: The Places they were to possess, the Leaders they were to follow, and the Word also for their con∣duct. They also caused the Galley-foist of the
Council of Ten to be Surveyed by people unsus∣pected, and found the Artillery she had aboard for their purpose. Jaffier had the curiosity of seeing the solemnity of the Dukes Espousal of the Sea, it being likely to be the last; and there his compassion is reiuforced upon the prospect of those publick rejoycings. The tranquillity where∣in he beheld the unfortunate Venetians, excited anew his concern for their hastning perdition, till at length he became more wavering than ever. But to conclude, Heaven would not abandon the work of twelve Ages, and of so many able Ma∣sters to the fury of a Courtezan, and a Troop of desperate Men. The good Genius of the Republick suggested to Jaffier an expedient whereby he concluded he might save altogether, both Venice and his Com∣panions: He therefore finds out Bartholomew Comino, Secretary to the Council of Ten; tel∣ling him he had a matter of State, of extraordi∣nary importance to communicate, but that he would first have the Dukes and Councils assu∣rance of Grace and Pardon, wherein they should tye themselves with all the Religious and Holy Circumstances possible, to ratify by the Senate what they should promise; which Grace was the Life of twenty two Persons which he should no∣minate, let the Crimes be never so monstrous; That otherwise all the Toiments they could inflict, should never be able to draw a word from his
Mouth. The Ten were thereupon immediately assembled, and Ordered a Committee to wait up∣on the Duke to receive from him the Parole Jaffier had demanded, wherein he complyed with the same readiness they had done before; and then Jaffier, fully satisfied in what he went about, dis∣covered to them the whole Conspiracy. The Story was so full of horror and wonder, that it was too big for their Belief; howbeit it being easie to verify some of the Particulars, Comino was in mediately dispatcht to the Bell-Tower of the Procuratie, and reports that he found the Guards wholly drunk or asleep; then they sent to the Arsenal, where it was long ere they could find the Officers that were concerned: but in the end, one of the Servants afrightned with the Threatnings wherewith they menaced him, dis∣covered to them a small Wicket which they forced open, after they had long knockt in vain; there they found them with the three Petardiers, employed upon finishing the five Fire-works that were destined for the Execution: they were ask'd what made them work upon so eminent a Feast-day, and why they made no answer upon their knocking so long at the door? To which they replyed with much presence of Wit; That the Petardiers being to depart on the morrow to∣wards the Fleet, and that the General had com∣manded them to prepare a quantity of Fire-works just ready to be put in use, and that not having
a sufficient quantity ready made, they had in∣treated the others to assist them to compleat that Quantity: That the Affair seeming to them of some importance, they conceived it their duty for once to dispence with the Solemnity of the Day; and the better to follow their Work with∣out scandal, they had shut themselves up as they found them into the most retired place of the Ar∣senal, which they had chosen for that purpose. Although Comino could find nothing to Reply to this Confession, yet he was careful to confine them all Prisoners: The Ten more and more amazed, dispatcht them to the Greek Courtezans, but there they found no body; those that were appointed to debauch the Guards in the Bell Tower, hav∣ing fained themselves asleep amongst the rest, up∣on Comino's appearing among them, did upon his departure immediatly hasten to the Greeks, where they gave the Alarum so warmly, that upon the very moment Nolot, Robert, Revillido, Retrosi, Villa Mezzana, Durand, Ternon, and Robert Bru∣lard that by accident were there, fled, and em∣barkt themselves in a Boat they had retained at the Rialto Bridg, for the Transportation of the Troops at the Lazaretto, and happily made their escape out of Town. The displeasure the Vene∣tians took at their missing them, put them upon resolutions of visiting the Ambassadors Houses of France and Spain, without further delay; they therefore made civil demand of Admission, upon
business that imported the Service of the Repub∣lick: The French Ambassador made no scruple to admit them, and Renault was apprehended, and led away together with Laurence Brulard and Bribe. But the Ambassador of Spain, very sharp∣ly alledged the priviledg of his Character, and with much importment protested against the vio∣lence they offered, when he perceived they would force their Passage: Upon their entry they found Arms for above 500 Men, 60 Petards, together with a very great quantity of Powder & Fire∣works, and such-like Preparations; whereof they drew up an exact Inventory, himself being present mocking at their Curiosity. Upon their carry∣ing this Inventory to the Council of Ten; a No∣ble-man of the House of Valiera a rrived, bring∣ing with him Brainvill and Theodore, two of the Principal Conspirators: These upon intimation the Plot was discovered, and despairing to save themselves by flight, the Gates being all guard∣ed upon their escaping from the Greeks, resolved upon another course, and feigning to discover the Conspiracy, sought out this Noble-man, whom they had known in Flanders, that he might car∣ry them before the Council of Ten where they were secured. In the mean time a general Search was made through all the Taverns, Inns, Lodgings of hire, Brothel-houses, and wheresoever Strang∣ers might be supposed to conceal themselves; seizing on all the Officers they found, of Hollands,
French, Spaniards, Walloons, Neopolitans, or Millanois, to the number of near 400. Amidst these Transactions, two Dauphinois arrived from Orange, Booted and Spurred, just as they had cast themselves from their Post-Horses into the Boat that conducted them thither; these declared to the Council of Ten, that some French-men of their acquaintance had written them from Venice, That if they had an inclination to enrich them∣selves, they need but hasten to Venice, where there was a Conspiracy just upon execution to surprize the whole City, and expose it to Pillage, & that they were come with all possible diligence, to make discovery of this Treason, instead of being sharers therein: they were received with thanks, and honourably entertained, and in∣treated to take their repose whilst the Senate should consider upon a fitting reward for their Service. By this time it was day, and the Senate assem∣bled, and the Marquis of Bedamar demanded Au∣dience, which in curiosity only was granted him. The noise of the Conspiracy was by this time dispersed throughout the City, and begat a general consternation among the Inhabitants; who having attained only an imperfect account that the Spaniards were the Authors, they imme∣diatly beset the Ambassadors Palace to force it, and were just upon putting fire to it, when the Guard that was to conduct him to his Audience
arrived; who making their Commission known, the People flattered with hopes the Senate would make him a publick example, permitted him to come out alone, conducting him with all the Imprecations and Indignities imaginable. The Ambassador being admitted into the Se∣nate, began his Speech, with a most angry com∣plaint against the violence had been committed upon his House against the common right of Na∣tions; he accompanied his Complaints with me∣naces of Revenge, so fierce and violent, that the Major part of the Senators were struck with Con∣sternation, and apprehended he had yet recourse to means whereof they were yet ignorant, to put his Enterprize in execution. The Duke replyed, That some excuse might be contrived for the Out∣rage, if any reason could be given for those Pre∣parations of War that had been found in his House, who being an Ambassador, ought to be a Minister of Peace: To which he replyed, That he wondered people reputed so wise, should be yet so disingenuous, to insult to his Face upon a pretext so frivolous; That they knew as well as himself, that all those Provisions were but de∣posited in his House, as at other times he had practised, to be sent to Naples and Tyrole; as to the Arms, 'twas the general Opinion that the best in the World were made by the Subjects of the Republick; and for the Fire-Works, &c. the occasion of some excellent Work-men in that
Art, that had been presented him, had engaged him to employ them out of curiosity: The Duke interrupting him, said, those Work-Men were Villains, or rather Monsters, born to the eternal shame of humane race; and, upon these words, presented the Ambassador with a Letter of Credence for the Governour of Milan, which they had found among Renault's Papers, with o∣ther Letters of the Duke of Ossuna. The Am∣bassador replyed, that for the Duke of Ossuna he had always declared that he would never be ac∣comptable for any proceedings of his: As to the Letter of Credence, it was true the Ambassador of France had some time since recommended a Gen∣tleman to him, that stood in need of his Favour, upon some pretension he had in Milan, and that upon that motive he had given him his Letter, which was the same they presented to him, but was utterly ignorant the Republick was at all in∣terested in the affair. The Duke perceiving by his Replies, that the Ambassador would never want fair Apologies, contented himself to repre∣sent to him with much gravity the foulness of his Enterprize; and concluded, protesting that they were all far from suspecting the King his Master had the least part therein: The Ambas∣sador upon that Remonstrance, answer'd with all the Emportment of an honest Man, whose Ho∣nour is unjustly attacqu'd; That he was of a Na∣tion to which Valour and Prudence were so na∣tural,
that there could be no need of recourse to Secret Practices, to destroy their Enemies; That the King his Master was a Prince of Power, suf∣ficient to subdue them by open force, without the Assistance of Treasons and Conspiracies, which possibly they might soon find to their Cost; upon these words he briskly withdraws without ob∣serving the least Ceremony; those that conduct∣ed him, conjured him to retire for some space in∣to a Neighbouring Apartment, until the Senate should take necessary care for his Preservation: he without any reply consented to the Proposition, and boiling with rage retired whithersoever they pleased to conduct him. In the mean time the People had drawn toge∣ther in the Market-place, to assassine him, in case the Senate should acquit him: But a Guard being sent to secure the embarking of his Servants, and the most valuable of his Moveables, he was himself therupon conducted by som obscure way through the Palace, on board a Brigantine; by which, under the protection of a good Convoy, he got away. The People enraged at his Escape, made Effigies both of him and the Duke of Ossuna, treating them with the same Indignities they would have done to their Persons, had they been in their pow∣er. Upon the same instant was dispatcht Orders to the General of their Fleet, to cause l'Anglade, the Captain Jaques Pierre, and all the Officers of the Conspiracy, which the Captain had on board
his Ships, to be immediately drown'd: but upon expectation that they would be upon their Guard, they made choice of a Vessel for this mes∣sage the most improper they could light on, and equipt her so, as to hinder all manner of suspi∣cion that she came from thence; Ordering her also to steer a Course with so great compass about, that she should seem of all others, least bound from the Place out of which she sailed. Information was afterwards made that the Captain had been in a readiness all the night, and that having observed the arrival of that Vessel, he retired into the midst of his Squadron, as if he had been in some suspi∣cion of the truth, and was willing to be in a po∣sture of defence in case he should be betrayed: But 'tis to be thought that he unwilling to hazard the danger of discovery upon what might prove only a bare panick fear, took some time to deliberate if it were fit to declare, whilst the General who lost not one moment of time, dispatcht two per∣sons on board him, the least suspicious he could; who appearing without any Arms, were admit∣ted to his Cabbin, where finding him alone ac∣costed him with an air of much indifference, and stabbing him, threw him into the Sea, without the least noise: L'Anglade, and 40 of his Offi∣cers were served in the same sort, with all the expedition imaginable, and the like secrecy. In the mean time Renault is examined at Ve∣nice, who replyed he understood not what they
demanded; they shew him the Letter of Cre∣dence to Don Pedro, a Pasport in Spanish, Bills of Exchange for considerable Sums of Money, and 1000 Pistols in ready Gold: Upon which he replyed, That he neither knew the Ambassa∣dor of Spain, nor the Governour of Milan; so that in case any could be found among his Papers, that led them to those Inquiries, it must needs be that some body had maliciously put them there. They brought him to the Rack, and gave him the question ordinary and extraordina∣ry, to which he answered nothing that was new, only that he was a Poor, Honest Gentleman of Quality and Honour, and that God would be his Revenge: The Rack was several days toge∣ther presented him, with promise of his Life in case he would but confess what he knew, but all to no purpose; and after having suffered all their ways of torment, he was in the end strangled in the Prison, and after exposed in publick for a Traytor, hanging by one Leg. The Lieutenant of the Count de Nassaw, the three Petardiers, Bribe, Laurence, Brulard, and the two Officers of the Ar∣senal, were all so strangled, after having suffered the question with the same constancy: But Brainvil and above 300 Officers were only strang∣led, or secretly drowned. In the mean time Jaffier in desperation upon the dismal success of his Compassion, loudly complained of the breach of promise of the Duke
and Council, touching the Preservation of his Companions: They had not indeed failed but upon deliberate advice; many were of opinion it should be religiously observed; others concluded it doubtful in case they had not received any in∣timation but by Jaffier: But the two Dauphinois that also discovered it, put the Senate upon the same resolution, as if Jaffier had not done any thing therein; to which resolution they were the rather led, for the greater horror, and example to the Publick, albeit much might have been urg∣ed to the contrary; they endeavoured therefore to appease Jaffier, by all means possible; tendring him both Money and Employment, which he refused, obstinately persisting in his fruitless de∣mand of the Lives of his Companions, and in the end left the City inconsolable for their Suffer∣ings, which the Senate coming to understand, ordered him to desert their State within the space of three days, on pain of death, and 4000 Chiquins for whosoever should take him. The resentments of his Pitty for his Companions re∣doubled upon every Reflection that himself was the Author of their Death; he considered by the way that the Enterprize of Bressia was yet in a condition of taking effect, and the desire of Re∣venge upon the Senate, carried him to that Town, where he was hardly arrived when the Ten hav∣ing discovered by some Papers of the Conspira∣tors; Troops were immediately dispatcht to pos∣sess
the Principal Posts, and to put to the Sword such Spaniards as had been Introduced: Jaffier was taken Prisoner fighting at the Head of the Party, as a Man that sought nothing more than to sell his Life at a greater rate than ordinary, who being some few days after sent to Venice, was there drown'd the day after his Arrival. The Death of this unfortunate Wretch perfe∣cted the establishment of tranquillity in that great City. The first care of the Senate was to demand an∣other Ambassador from Madrid; Don Lewis Bravo was soon nominated for that Employment, with Order to depart immediately, the Marquis of Bedamar giving him (according to custom) In∣structions which were reducible almost to two Heads: The first was, That the new Ambassa∣dor should lowly and publickly blame the Con∣duct of his Predecessor, and should affect a Me∣thod quite different in his own, even in matters of the greatest Indifference. The other was, That in all Affairs that should occur, touching the Rights and Preheminences of the Republick, he should consult above all things, Squittinio della liberta Veneta, to which the Marquis of Bedamar refers him upon several Points mentioned in those Instructions, and in terms howbeit obscure, yet evidencing the Paternal Kindness he had for that Libel. And now it was decreed by Proclamati∣on, and sound of Trumpet, through the whole
Venetian State, that none should presume on pain of death, to impute the least share of the Con∣spiracy, either to his Catholick Majesty or his Subjects. Thirty Thousand Ducats were given to the two Dauphinois, that had come express from their own Countrey to discover the Conspi∣racy. Don Pedro finding matters now past all hopes, dismist quite his Troops and surrendred Verseil; the Duke of Ossuna generously provided for the Wife and Children of the Captain, setting them at liberty; and the Marquis of Bedamar received Orders from Spain to depart and serve as Princi∣pal Minister in Flanders, and some years after from Rome a Cardinals Hat. FINIS.
