¶ An exposicyon of the .xv. psalme made by ma∣yster Erasmus of Rotherdame in whiche is full purely decla∣red the pure and clene beha∣uoure that ought to be in the pure churche of Chryst which is the multytude of all trewe chrysten people. ¶ you be the lyght of the worlde. Let therfore your lyght so shyne before men that they may see youre good workes and so glori∣fye your father which is in heuen. Mattheu. v.
¶ To the chrysten reader. IF my grosse en¦deuer coulde so purely ha∣ue sette forth in Englyshe the exposicion of this most godly and pure psalme as it is pu∣rely wrytten in pure latyne by ma∣yster Erasmus / than truely durste I promyse the that to reade it o moost pure and gentylle reader shulde be to the a passynge pure and profytable pastyme. It is in∣tytled by the sayde mayster Eras∣mus. De puritate ecclesie / that is to wytte it dothe declare the pure∣nes whiche ought to be in all chry∣sten or pure people called the chur∣che or congregacyon of god. And
I doubte nat (my grosse translacyon natwithstandynge) but who s euer shall please to reade it purely the same shall fynde godlynes in it so purely shewed that it shal synke pleasauntly and purely in to theyr breastes / and consequently aryse out of the same agayne in pure and godly behauoure to the honour of god and to the wealthe bothe of them selues and of other theyr ne∣yghbours abydynge about them. And moreouer the pure and plea∣saunt style or forme of eloquente speache whiche this wryter mays∣ter Erasmus passynge all other dothe generally vse in wrytynge / shall delyte the passynge any other mynstrelsye. For no harmonye is so pleasaunte as eloquence beynge an vndoubted and singuler good gyfte of the holy ghoste / and lyke∣wyse a gyfte more vtyle than any other mynstrelsye or harmonye
mundayne. And moreouer no mynstrel or musicyan I dare say & can well proue was euer better ex∣perte in any kynde of musyke / thā was Erasmus in eloquence. Whi∣che as it is declared in al other his noble workes / so dothe it in this moost souerayntly appeare ioyned with moste pure prophesye and de∣claracyon of scripture that is mu∣syke and harmony celestiall. So that yf thys our author dyde euer vtter these his passynge swete and melodyous gyftes of eloquence & pure prophesye in any other his workes (as vndoubtedly he hathe done) yet dyd he neuer more frelye declare hym selfe and his sayd ver∣tues or gyftes thā in this treatyse / & as I wene neuer so frely. Whi∣che worke oughte and shall delyte the so moche the more / that he doth shewe this his musyke to accorde with the moost pure expositers of
scripture / whome god hathe gracyouslye nowe in our tyme rayse vp to the expulsyon of fylthye an grosse errours / that otherwyse b called of vnpure preachers vnwrytten verytes / and to the redusynge or restorynge of the pure veryte contayned in scripture holy / whiche god graunte shortely to be knowen and folowed of vs all to his pure honoure. Amen. ¶ The texte of the psalme. LOrde who shal dwell in thy ta∣bernacle? Who shall reste vpon thy holy hylle? Euen he that entreth in with out spot or leadeth an vncorrupte lyfe / & doth the thynge whiche is ryght.
He which speaketh the truthe from  the harte / and vseth no disceyte in his tonge and dothe none euyll to his neyghbour / and sclaundreth nat his neyghbours. In whose syght the vngodlye is  nought set by / but doth glorifye or make moche of those whiche do dreade the lorde. He whiche sweareth to his neygh∣bour  and disceyueth hym nat / he that gyueth not forth his money vpon vsurye / and taketh no re∣warde agaynste the innocent. Who so dothe these thynges shall  neuer be remoued. ¶ A Paraprhase of the psalme. LOrde who shall be receyued in to thy tabernacle? Who shall abyde with the in heuen beyng as a mountayne in whiche thy holy maiestye doth appere?
A man walking syncerely witho crafte or dissimulacion doyng th is ryght and which speaketh th he sayth faythfully with harte a mynde. Whiche loueth to hurte no ma with tong / which doth none euy to his neyghboure nor sclaūderet hym or rayseth no rebuke or ignmynye vpon hym. Which set noughte by the wicke or vngodly / but estemeth hyely th which do loue god / which wyll na go from that thinge which he hat sworne or earnestly promysed. Whiche hath nat with his mone occupyed vsurye / nouther doth take brybe or mede to the domag of an innocēte / he that loueth to do these thinges shall neuer perysshe. ¶ Finis.
¶Lorde who shall dwell in thy tabernacle? FOr so moche as there is one onely way vn∣to saluacyon, & life e∣ternall / whiche is to know god, & to obeye his comaūdemētes. The prophete in the psalme goyng nexte before, dyd bewayle & lamente more, than blynde madnes of men / amonges whome were founde so fewe / whi∣che ioyfully and gladly wolde re∣ceyue or embrace the gentle, and redely offered mercye of our crea∣tour and redemer. But contrarye wyse, all they for ye more parte be∣ynge corrupte with theyr owne lustes and concupiscences, were so broughte into a peruerse mynde, that in theyr harte they wolde say: there is no god. And out of this fountayne of wycked persuasyon
which they had of god / dyd spryng all maner of myscheuous dedes done towarde our neighbour. No∣ther can any man loue his neyghbour with herte and mynde, whic dothe nat loue god.Unbl∣f is the ro o al sche∣ou de∣ds lke as aithe is the ro∣ o cha∣. And no ma dothe loue his neyghbour verely / except he doth loue him for goddes sake. From fayth, as from the rote do sprynge the workes of charyte. Who soeuer therfore spekynge or talkynge with hym selfe / doth saye in hart that there is no god (for as∣moch as he hath an hart, full wyckedly & noughtely corrupte / from whēs doth procede his speche wit all other his fautes or doynges) the same dothe breathe nothyng vpon his neyghboure but moos Psal. xiiifoule stynche / suche as dothe issue out of sepulchres or graues / no∣thynge but fraude and disceyte, & the venyme of adders / whiche an other psalme doth calle incurableDeutero xxxii.
From this corrupte harte dothe procede all leudenesse of mysche∣uous wordes / all bytternes of de∣tractyon or backebytynge / from whiche princyples & begynnynges do men go forth, vntyll they come vnto the lust or desyre of blode she∣dynge / whiche is the vttermoste poynt, or buttell of rancoure & ha∣tered / accordyng to that saynge of Iohū:i. Io. iii. He that hateth his brother, is a murtherer or manqueller. For all thoughe he dothe nat alwayes actuall murther / whiche doth hate or beare rancoure / yet natwithstā∣dynge in that,To hate oure ne∣yghbour is mur∣thr. he folowyng his yre or wrathe dothe studye to harme his neyghboure / he dothe in that approche to murther / and in that so farforthe as in hym is, he is an homicyde or murtherer. For lyke as accordynge to the testymony of Iohn̄Iohn̄. iii. / no greater ioy is vnto god∣lye people / than whan they do se
many men come to y• knowlege of the uthe / & to walke in the waye of he veryte euangelycall: Euen so is no dolour or grefe to thē more bytter & payneful,The mos byt¦te dlour of a rue chrysten / is to se his neigh¦bour a¦ke in ig∣oraūce. than whan they do cōsyder in the great multytude of mē so grosse ignoraūce / so great contempte of god moste benygne & gacyous / so great lacke of charyte to our neyghbours / and contrary∣wyse to se in so fewe men, any signe or semblaunce to appere of verye fayth and true charyte. Nother do the Epicures only say in theyr hart there is no god / but that I can nat speke without greuous syghes & doloure / we may fynde men innu∣merable amonge the christyane, whiche in theyr hart do saye, there is no god. And wolde god there were no hrysten people, whiche wolde vomyte or thruste forth such deuelysshe and wycked sayenges amonges the christyanes. But for
because we shulde lette passe suche monstrous and wōderfull wycked wordes / we wyll touche thynges more vsuall, and cōmen, or fami∣lyare. Tey whiche haue no loue or regarde of spirituall thynges / but do all coueyte & gape after ry∣ches / worldly honoures, excesse, or lechery, and suche lyke volutes / in sekynge to gette these thynges / outher by ryght or wronge / by per∣iurye, brybery, and thefte / or suche other lyke feates or craftes: which whan they haue obtayned suche thynges, do thynke them selues blessyd or happye / and whan they do lose them, be redy to blaspheme bothe god and his sayntes. Do nat suche also shewe them selues to say in theyr harte:Titus. i. there is no god? In mouth they do professe god / but in deades they do renye hym. Of such is so great a multytude & plentye / and contrarye wyse of those which
shulde truely drede god, is so great Psalme. xiii.scarcyte yt the prophete doth bryng forth god lokynge out of heauen whether any creature at all shulde be in the earth hauynge vnderstā∣dynge and requirynge or sekynge after god / and in beholdynge with his eyes from aboue all mākynde / he founde none, except one whiche is Chryste Iesus / with whome be they, natwithstandynge all ioyntly recounted & nombred / who soeuer y faythe and charyte be made one with hym.Ergo they whi¦c o trut in  good wor¦ks as thy calle th do nat please god. For no creature syth the worlde was fyrste made, dyd euer please god / excepte the same hathe put his confydence in the free and mere mercy of god offered vnto all men through Christ. For although dyuers haue be saued vnder the lawe of nature / and many vnder the lawe of Moyses / and yet more vnder the lawe of the gospell / yet saluacyon or sauetie, is nat proper∣ly
due, ne to be ascrybed vnto any lawe / but al onely vnto the mercye of god throughe Chryst.the chur∣che of Chr was ur sthe the bgyn∣nge of the worl∣de. From the very begynnynge of ye worlde was the church or cōgregacion of right∣wyse men, whiche is the bodye of Chryste / and euen from that tyme, was the euangely or gospell / that is to say remissyon of synnes reue∣led of god from heuen throughe ye mere and free mercye of god for Chrystes sake / & euen from ye tyme also was grace, whiche throughe faythe dyd purefye the hartes of men / althoughe by Chryste incar∣nate,Actes. xv and by the prechynge of the apostelles / it was than the more largely spredde abrode / and dyd also shyne ye more clerely. So that than it appered full true, that the apostell Paule doth so often incul∣cate or repete: very ryghtwysenes doth come vnto no man by ye lawe,Rom̄. iii. or by workes of the lawe / but by
faythe and confydence in Chryste But all men had nat fayth, by whche they shulde beclyppe and embrase the grace offered. Lyke as also nowe a dayes all though ther be fl many which do professe faith wt theyr mouthe / yet be there rygh fewe whiche do beare true fayth in harte / the be I saye ryght fewe, yf so they be compared with those, which outher be alyantes from the gospell / or els with a pharisacall mynde do the gospel admytte and receyue. This paucyte and smalle nombre of true faythfull people, dyd Esay see and bewayle,Esay. lii. Paule alledgynge the place of his sayde prophecye, which is thus:Roma. x. O lorde who haue beleued oure wordes? And that whiche Chryste yet aby∣dynge in the earth, dyd saye to his discyples in this wyse.Luke. xii. Feare you nat o lytle flocke, for the kyngdo∣me of god is your or dothe {per}tayne
to you / the same may euen nowe be sayd of those whiche haue verely fastened all theyr confydence in Chryste. yet natwithstandynge in the same full fewe ryght christya∣nes / all thynges be weake, inchoa∣te or begonne and vnperfytte (I mought also saye) vnpure. After that, therfore this oure prophete Dauid had bewayled so great a paucyte and smalle nombre of in∣nocente people / and that contrary¦wyse, there is so great a turbe or multytude of vnryghtwyse & wyc∣ked people / And where as he also dyd se, yt there is no hope of sauetie but in the tabernacle of god, and in the holy mountayne, whiche is the church or cōgregacyon / In whiche no man is graūted to abyde or rest, excepte he be throughe faythe im∣planted in ye body of Chryst / which same, Chryst dothe crye vnto vs in the gospell saynge:Mat. xi. Come vnto me
all ye which do labour and be greued or burdened / and I shall eas & refresshe you. He consyderyng the impuryte & fylthynes of men where as is requyred synguler & {per}fyte puryte, yf we shulde be made one with Christ, and so abyde with hym in the house of god / the sayde prophete I tell you with full great feare & care, dothe thus crye to the father: O lorde who shall abyd in thy tabernacle, or who shal rest in thy holy mountayne? Therfore after the playne & moste vulgare sence / the tabernacle which Moyses by the cōmaundement of god had made,Erodi. xl was at Hierusalem in  mounte Syon / vntyll Salomon by the worde of god dyd buylde a iii. of kin¦ges. vi.newe in the same place / the passyng ryche noble & famous temple that was had in a reuerence euen of the hethen people & panymes. There also was the regall palace of Da∣uid.
And as ye iewes dyd boste thē selues to be the chyldre or posteryte of Abraham and of Dauid / euen so had they a peculyer reioyse and glorye for the cytie of Hierusalem / by whiche as by an holy thynge they dyd swere as we may {per}ceyue by the gospell.Matth. v. They were proude and holy mynded for the temple & the aulter whiche were in the cytie / wherof dyd come that checke gy∣uen to thē by ye prophete Ieremye: The temple of the lord / the temple of ye lorde / ye temple of the lorde. &c.Ieremie. vii. There dyd they beleue god to dwel there dyd they recken he shulde be worshypped & odoured / that there he wold be prayed vnto / that there he wolde be offered vnto, and pace∣fyed with sacrifyces / that there the lawe ought to be inquyred and the questyons of the lawe / there was the propicyatorye,Erody. xxvi. Hbrues ix. out of whiche god dyd gyue and shewe forth dy∣uyne
oracles or answeres / ther were the tables written vpon wit the fynger of god. There was Aarons rodde, & the arke of the testa∣ment / the holy table / the potte o Manna / the cherubym There was sanctum sanctorum / that is to say, the holyest of all holy / in to whiche no man mought entre, excepte the hye preest onely / and yet mought he nat that do, but ones in ye yere. Of these thynges before shewed, dyd aryse pryde and presumpcyon in the people of the iewes / wherby they also contempned and dispysed all other nacyons. Fynally they had the temple in suche great re∣uerence / that they dyd obiecte it a∣gaynste Chryste, for a cryme moost horryble and outragyous that he sayd:Iohn̄. ii. vndo or distroy you this tem∣ple / and I in .iii. dayes shall rayse it vp agayne / wherby he dyd co∣uertly signyfye, that he shulde be
sayne of the iewes / and within .iii. a, he sulde reuyue or lyue a∣gayne. Therfore after my mynde this psalme after ye lytterall sence / doth peulyerly belonge to the le∣uytes and preestes / Whose duetye was to abyde and reaste in the tem¦ple, to whiche they were deputed minysers. Of these was requyred hye and perfyte puryte and syngu∣ler sanctemonye or holynes / but whiche the cōmen sorte of ye iewes dyd yet thynke to consyste in exte∣ryor ceremonyes.Theiues do recken holynesse to cōsiste ī ceremo∣nyes. Concernynge which holynes, they had holy con∣secracyon, & often locyons or was∣shynges of the heed / of the handes & also of theyr garmentes. It was was nat lefull for the preestes to be present at a buryall / nor to touche a deed caryone / nor to eate propha∣ne or vnhalowed breed / nor to vy∣syteMat. xii. theyr wyues and chyldren / nor to moue theyr fote out of the tem∣ple,
in especyall vpon those dayes in whiche they dyd minyster in th temple / leste they shulde gette o take some impurite or vnclennes But all these thynges were no∣thynge els / but shadowes and fy∣gures of thynges farre more excel∣lent and precyous. For our true Dauid) to whome promyse was made, that his kyngdome shulde be enlarged euen vnto ye vttermost costes and marches of the worlde / which kyngdome shulde cōtynewe so longe as the sonne or mone / and to whome is gyuen al power,Psalme. lxxi. both in heuen and in earth),Matthe. xxviii. is Chryste anointed nat wt the oyle of prestes / but with grace celestyall,Psalme. liiii. ouer and aboue all the chyldren of men. His regall palace is the churche or con∣gregacyon, whiche the lorde hym selfe dothe otherwhyles call the kyngdome of heuen. His imperye or dominyon, is the lyberte of the
spiryte. The tabernacles is the con¦gregacyon of all true beleuynge people in all or euery nacyon. Hie∣rusalem is yt mystycall cytie, which saynt Iohn̄ dyd se in the reuela∣cyon .xxi. beynge buylde of lyuely stones / Chryst beyng the heed cor∣ner stone.ii. Peter ii. The holy mountayne is ye sublymyte or hyghnes of ye doc∣tryne euangelycall / and the inuio∣lable veryte, vpon which the buyl∣dynge of the temple dothe leane & is grounded vpon. Of whiche is also thus mencyoned in an other psalme:Psalme C.xxiiii he that trusteth in the lord / shall as the mounte Syon, neuer be moued / whiche abydeth in Ie∣rusalem. The prophete therfore cō∣templatynge with spirituall eyes / the wonderfull maiestye and sanc∣tymonye or holynes of the church / whiche holynes the fygures of the olde lawe before shewed with other lyke dyd signefye / by the glorye of
whiche churche also those thynge whiche dyd appere very gloryou to the iewes, were obscured & darkened / & after the interpretacyo of Paule,ii. Corin. iii. were made without glorye. The same prophete also, seyn yt there is no mortall mā which ca abyde pure in the house of god, and offre to god lacrefyce acceptable  he tournynge to the father or he∣uen doth crye thus: O lorde who shall abyde in thy tabernacle, or reste in thy holy mountayne? The tue knowlege of god is drawen and coarted in to a very strayte or narowe angle of the worlde. The other nacyons do worshyppe for god, stockes and stones / they do sa∣crefyce vnto deuelles / after whose luste and pleasure, they be drawen as oxen by the nose vnto all kynde of myschefe. And amonge the selfe same nacyons or people, whome thou haste chosen aparte to the /
whome thou haste excited or called by so many wōders and myracles to the knowelege of thy maiestye / whome thou haste by so mauy be∣nefites prouoked to loue the / who∣me thou haste fensyd with so many preceptes and cōmaundementes / whome thou haste instructe by so many prophetes / amonges ye same people is none that accordynglye dothe worshyppe the. They haue one god in theyr mouthe / but in theyr harte haue they many god∣des. Whyles one dothe serue yre, enuye, and desyre of vengeaunce / another serueth auaryce / and some ambicyon & pryde. And they which do appere to thē selues excellently iuste or ryghtwyse for obseruynge the lawe / do nat yet obserue that whiche is the heed of the lawe. For who doth loue ye with all his hart, with all his mynde, & with all his power / & his neyghboure as hym
selfe? Thus thy lawe (where as of it selfe, it is good) doth come euyll to passe with them, turnynge them to euyll / nother doth it pacefye the, but prouoke the to angre / nother doth it see quyte, or dismysse them foūde gyltye or fautye / but it doth accuse & condempne them. A great sorte of men dothe worshyppe the after the cōmaūdementes of men / & with ceremonyes, they do walke in thy temple, they do kylle sacre∣fyces / they do offer oblacions.worshyp¦pynge of god fter ns com¦maunde∣mentes & remo∣nes is neare re∣bked & in the gos¦pell such is called als wor¦shyppe.

But for so moche as thou arte the hye and full parfyte truth or veryte / thou doste requyre true worshyppers, whiche shulde

For he shall come nat to destroye or cause any to pe∣rysshe / but to preserue and saue: He shall come nat to iudge or con∣dempne / but to recōcyle & to make peace betwyxte god and man. No∣ther wyll he begynne to rebuke or sclaunder his neyghbours / whiche dyenge wyl crye for his most cruell tormntours or murtherers:Luk. xxiii. Fa∣ther forgyue them for they wote

And they by ye same shal purchase none other thynge to them selues than confu∣syon or shame euerlastynge & most greuous dethe or destruccyon. For this my preest whome I wyll or∣dayne Hebrues ii.chefe ruler in my newe tem∣ple and in my kyngdome shall by deth ouercome the author of deth / and by shamefull deth of the crosse he shall haue moste honorable try∣umphe of the spirytes or deuylles his aduersaryes. And partakers of this glorye shall he make all thē whiche fearynge to offende the fa∣ther wyll heare and obey my wel∣beloued sonne.Matth. xvii. In whome onely I shal haue so great pleasure and ly∣kynge that nothynge at all can of∣fende or displease me. He moreouer shall be in so great bothe fauour &
auctoryte with me yt I wyll denye hym nothing. In the meane whyle it is ryght and true glorye to ouer∣come the worlde to ouercome the flesshe and to ouercome the deuyll. But lyke as the glory of my sonne shall in maner be hydde or vn∣knowen amonges men / whan he shall be in the shappe or semblaūce of a poore and humble or vyle ser∣uaunte / yea and of a synner / whan he shal be rebuked and reuyled ac∣cused condempned and put vpon a crosse: Euen so shall the glorye also of thē which do drede god be hydde and vtterly vnknowen amonges men by reason of infirmyte of the flesshe / or at the leaste it shal be ob∣scured and darkened. But whan he beynge nowe condempned and crucifyed betwyxte two theues shal come agayne in his maiestye with thousandes of aungelles vnnume∣rable / all godly people also rysyng
together with hym vnto lyfe / and they whiche were partakers with hym of tribulacyons shall be also partakers with hym of glory: Thā shall ye wicked se whome they haue smytten and wounded: They shall than se them (whome before they haue cōculcate and troden downe) with theyr excellent bryghtnes to obscure or darken the clerenes of y• sonne / where as they them felues shall lamente and bewayle theyr owe madnes. These thynges ha∣ue I thought good to touche / for because I do se that of ye olde doc∣tours some haue applyed all this whole psalme vnto the persone of Chryst / to whome do full parfytly quadre and agree these wordes hy∣therto spoken. But the wordes fo∣lowynge do nat seme to accorde so well to his {per}son:  Which sweareth to his neighbour and doth not dis∣ceyue hym / whiche hath nat gyuen
forth his money to vsurye / & hathe nat taken brybes or rewardes vp∣on innocentes. Nother is it any great prayse nat to haue done those thynges / whiche without a great cryme cā nat be cōmytted or done / Suche as these be: to worke false∣hede by {per}iurye / to increase worldly substaunce by vsuryes / to be cor∣rupte with brybes / to condemne or to beare false wytnes against an innocente body. They whiche vsed to do suche thynges were recoūted euyll doers euen amonges the he∣then and myscreantes / & they were punysshed by the lawes:ii. questy∣ons mo∣ued. Agayne∣wrde they whiche dyd no suche thynges dyd nat receyue any pu∣blicke rewarde vsed to be gyuen to suche men as had done for the cō∣mune weale. But nothynge dothe appertayne to Christ but tht is of hye perfeccyon / and that surmoun∣teth all the prceptes of the lawe.
Here aryseth vp also an other qutyon: wherfore in the discrybyng  Chryst doth he recyte these forsay vyces more than other whiche al the lawe dothe condempne as  ensample: whiche dothe not steal Eodi. xix.which doth nat kylle or slee / whi doth no aduoutrye or fornicacyo But these doubtes do prycke a somwhat trouble vs thoughe  shuld applye this present place  vnto the persone of Christ / but other vnto ye minysters of ye churc or els vnto euery membre of t churche. The explicacyon of the diffyculties dothe parhappes rquyre an hye or excellente wytte / that is well exercysed in holy scriptures / I natwithstandynge accordynge to my feblenes wyll shew forth my mynde or thought in suc wyse that no man shall be stoppe from sayeng his deuyse / yf he hat any better matter to brynge forth
scripture doth in dyuers fassions structe vs to lerne vertue & god∣ynesse. Other whyle it doth kepe ye rdre of nature ī callyng vs backe yrste from vyces / & there after ex∣ortyng vs to vertues.what or∣dre or fas¦siōs scrip¦ture doth vse ī tea∣chinge or exhortīg. For to for∣ette euyll and vyces is naturally he fyrste and former thynge. And he seconde or nexte to that is to go nto goodnes and vertues / lyke as naturally fyrste is the thynge whiche is vnparfyte and (as the Apostle doth calle it) naturall / and there after that is parfyte and spi∣ytuall.i. Corin. xv. This ordre dothe here the piryte of god kepe whan he sayth:Psalme. xxxiiii. Auoyde or declyne from euyll and o good / seke peace & pursue ther∣after. In a lyke wyse dothe Esaye sayenge: Take ye awaye the euyll of your cogitacyons or thoughtes from my eyes / leaste you do per∣uersly / and learne you to do well.Esaye. i. Forthwith doth he ioyne thereun∣der
the preceptes of charyte saye socour the nedy / do iudgement  the fatherlesse chylde / defende t wydowe. &c. In lykewyse also iparable of the gospell:Matthe. xii. The hou is fyrste made cleane & afterwar cōmaunded to be anourned. Clens that is to say innocencye doth come by faythe and baptysme / the ornamētes be good workes. Such a lyke thyng is that also spoken by Paule:Romans iii. let vs caste away ye workes of darkenes / and let vs put on the armoure of lyght. Also Colossians iii: Nowe put you of all thynges wrathe. &c. This ordre is somtyme also tourned / that is to witte whee as those thynges be fyrst cōmaun∣ded whiche be parfyte / and those thynges after be forbydde that be contrarye. Of whiche sorte is this sayeng of Paule:Romans iii. So that we may walke honestly as in the day nat in fraunchynge or surfettynges & in
dronkenes / nat in chambryng and vnclennes / nat in contencyon & en∣uyenge. And these fassyons be of∣ten tymes myxte or myngled toge∣ther as in the words of Chryste sayenge: Blesse hem which do per∣secute you / blesse & curse nat.Romas xii. Other whyles good thynges onely be cō∣maunded as for xample: Thou shalte loue thy lorde god with all thyne hart. &c.Matth xxii. And thy yghbour as thy selfe. The prohibytynge of euyll thynges doth rather agree to harde and obstynate people: the cō¦maundynge of good thynges is a∣greable to suche as be obdyent / & of theyr owne accorde inflamed to vertue and godlynes.Howe scripture dth tem∣pre dc∣tyne ac∣cordynge to the  posicyōs of all mē In suche fassyons doth the scripture procure the helth of all persones / so that the parfyte maye therin fynde howe they shulde procede & go forwarde: And the weake or forgetfull may there also haue howe they shulde
be refrayned & also admonysshed The rudenes or dulnes of oure nature in receuyng godly doc¦tryeThe rudenes & slouthe or dulne of mannes mynde is meruaylous And therfore the lawe of the .x. cō∣maundementes which were gyue vnto the grosse and rebellyous o obstynate people dothe contayne thre onely preceptes whiche do cō∣maunde thynges honeste and ver∣tuous / the other do prohibyte syn∣nes and enormyties: Thou shalte nat stele / thou shalt nat slee or kyll / thou shalte do no fornicacyon. &c. But so often as bothe these fassyōs be myngled to gether it moughte appere a thynge superfluous / ex∣cepte that our nature dyd requyre suche inculcacyons or repeticyons. For els whan the lorde had sayde: blesse you them which do persecute you / what nede he to adde blesse ye, but curse nat / except that he wolde the more deapely fasten the sayde lessone in the myndes of hys dysci∣ples?
Therfore bothe these fassyōs of speche be eche one vnderstande in other.In chris∣tes pre∣ceptes is an affir∣matyue alway cō¦tayned in a negaty¦ue and a negatyue in an af∣irmaty∣ue. As whan ye scrypture doh bydde god to be loued aboue all thynges & our neyghboure as our selues / ye same doth vndoutedly for¦byd al thīges which do discorde wt y• loue of god & of our neyghbour / & those be thynges innumerable. Agayne whan the lawe dothe faye: Thou shalte nat kylle / it hath well and iustly cōmaunded all ye dedes of charite by which we cā helpe our neyghbour. Also whā it sayth: thou shalte nat do fornicacyon / it dothe bydde all thynges whiche do pre∣serue clennes / sobernes / laboures / fastyng / prayeng. &c. But thynges whiche be hydde & vnknowen doth nat ye rude or vnlerned people vn∣derstande. And therfore haue the prophetes Christ and the Apostles opened bnto vs those thinges whi∣che haue be spoken cōpendiously &
couertly. Therfore ī this psalme is {pro}powned & set forth in a preposte∣rous ordre / fyrst ye cōtent & summe of {per}fyte religyon & godlynes / & thā for ye ruder sorte be the thynges ex∣pressed by name whiche be cōtrary to ye sayd descripcyon & image. For whā he sayth: he which doth entr wtout spotte & dothe worke ryght wysenes / he hath in ye same comprhēded al ryghtfulnes. For he whi∣che doth entre wtout spot doth cō∣mytte no vyce or synne / & agayne∣warde he doth omytte no vertue acordyng to ryght & his duetye. Ac∣cordyng to this intellygēce or vnderstādynge it is no faynte or febl prayse whā christ is denied to hau done any gyle wt his tonge. For s do we knowe hym alone to be suc one in whose wordes yt is to wytte Agaynste veretyes vnwryt∣ten.all ye whole canonicall scripture / eternall & vndoubted truth doth valyaūtly remayne wtout any spo
or blemysshe of erroure. Whā he is denyed to haue done euyl vnto his neyghbour / we do vnderstāde that all his lyfe & his dethe was orday∣ned and ordered to the helthe of all men. Whan he is denyed to haue begōne any rebuke or ygnomynye agaynste his neyghbours / we per∣ceyue that he dyd make intercessy∣on vnto his father euen for ye wyc∣ked and open euyll doers. Whan he is denyed to haue deceyued his neyghbour by periurye / we be ad∣monysshed that what soeuer thing Chryste dyd euer promyse by his prophetes (for by thē dyd he speke) the same hathe he ryght faythfully {per}formed.Hebrues i. He hath promysed great thynges / and that be vnnethes redyble to any mannes capacyte / hat is howe god shulde come in esshe / that he by his dethe shulde edeme mankynde / that he shulde within thre dayes reuye agayne
from deth / that he shuld ascende in to heauen / that he shulde come a∣gayne in glorye to iudge ye quyck and the deed / & to receyue his peo∣ple raysyd vnto lyfe to blessyd immortalyte. All these thinges for th most parte hath he all ready accoplysshed / and that is remaynyng wyll he perfourme in lyke fidelyte Whan he is reported that he dy nat lende or gyue forth his mone vnto vsurye / we vnderstande tha he was full pure from all earthl concupiscences / whiche was frel beneficyall to all men sekyng non outher profyte imperye or glory for so doynge: He dyd frely gyue he dyd heale frely the sycke / he dy frely redeme vs / and he be stowe frely hym selfe all whole / & all tha he had for our sakes:Matthe viii. he had nat  this worlde wherupon to reste h Iohan. xviii.heed / he dyd professe hym and h kyngdome nat to be of this world /
he sought nat his owne glorye / but the glorye of his father.Iohan. viii. So farre wyde was he from takyng rewar∣des agaynste innocentes yt he gaue hym selfe to be a ransome to rede∣me innocentes sufferynge deth for them that he shulde brynge them beynge reconsyled vnto lyfe euer∣lastyng. These thynges as they be surmountynge and passyng great / euen so dyd he onely perfourme & accomplysshe them / & therfore shal he neuer be moued.Hbrues xiii. For Iesus Chryst as sayth the Apostle yester¦day & to day he is all one for euer. And thus farforth haue I sayd cō∣cernynge the fyrst questyon which mought brynge ye reader in doubt / as if these cōmendacyons or pray∣ses were semynge vnmete and vn∣worthy for Chryst.The solucyon of the scon¦de questy¦on. Nowe is the o∣ther questyon to be soluted whiche is why the prophete dothe free and elyuer Chryste from these onely
vyces / seynge hat he was all together free and quyte from all ma∣ner crymes or vyces? The prophet appereth by these forsayd poyntes to haue properly deuyded ye person of Christ from all other. But in th onely persone of chryst were many personages / as the personage of a kynge / of a preest / of a prophete / o a iudge / & of a doctour.In the only per¦sonage of Christ be many pe¦sonages cōprehē∣ded. Luke. xi. Christ is a prfyte kng. In a kyn whiche coulde bynde the strong one mencyoned of in the gospell  entrynge in to his house violentl take away his goodes was requyred a power more than humayne  angelicall. And therfore it is sayd Te malygner in his presence i broughte to noughte.Christ is  passing hy preest In a pree whiche onely shulde purge & clen the spottes of all men was requyred a wonderfull clennes / which I can nat se founde in any man.hs. ii Psal. l. Fo we be all borne the chyldren of yre and wrathe / and accordynge to the
testymonye of Dauid we be concey¦ued in synnes. The onely sonne of god dyd come without carnall co∣pulacyon in to the wombe of a vir∣gyne / and dyd nat by his entrance in to her defyle but consecrate her purenes or clennes. And suche as was his concepcyon and natiuyte / suche was also all his lyuyng. And this noteth the prophete saynge: And he worketh ryghtewysenes." But there was neuer any preest whose concepcyon & natiuyte hath be with out all spotte / or whose lyfe hath be by all maner wyse inconta∣minate. Aaron the hye and the fyrst preest of all dyd so procede frō his mother / yt he neaded circumsicyon / Eodi xxii. 1. of yn∣ges. ii. nother dyd he a lytle offēde god fo∣lowynge the furye of the people in makynge a goldynge calfe. Hly dyd synne by ouermoche cocke∣rynge or tenderynge his sonnes.
Incredulyte was imputed & layde agaynste zachary ye father of Iohn̄ Luke. i.Baptyste / for which he was punis∣shed / the vsage of his tonge for a whyle taken away. But why do I recyte these? The very lawe dothe declare no mā to be without synne / Hebrues v.which therfore doth prescrybe a sa∣crefyce that ye preest ought to offre for his owne synne. I wyll here let passe to mencyon of the false pro∣phetes / For amonges the holy and cōmendable prophetes was neuer any pure frome all spotte or ble∣mysshe.Isay. vi. For Isaye dyd nede of a quycke cole / which shulde purefy  his lyppes. There was none of th but that was ignoraunte in somethynge / nother was the spiryte of prophecye alwaye present wt them / & thoughe he were present, yet dyd he nat put them in remembraunce of all thynges. For a certayne pro∣phete doth complayne sayeng:iiii. of kī∣ges. iiii. God
hath hydde from me this worde or thynge. To all was gyuen the gyft of prophecye accordyng to the pro∣porcyon or measure of theyr fayth:Coloss.  but in onely Chryste dyd inhabyte the fulnes of the godhede corpo∣ally / nother was he admonysshed or taught in a dreame or visyon / but he brought with hym from the father the full parfyte knowlege of all thynges that be paste present & o come. To this pertayneth that is here sayd: He spake the truth in his harte / and wrought no gyle in his tonge. In a iudge is requyred parfyte knowlege of causes / inte∣gryte or parfyte ryghtfulnes / and a mynde vncorrupte.Chryst is a syngu∣ler trewe iustyce or iudge. Iohn̄. v. The lorde doth reporte of him selfe in ye euan∣gely sayeng: The father doth iudge no man / but hath gyuen all iudge∣mente to the sonne / and in ye Crede is testefyed that he shall come to iudge the quycke and the deed. He
onely dothe iudge truely & verely Luke. xviwhich doth nat iudge after the ouwarde shewe or apparēce but doth innerly se & beholde the hartes / & regardeth nat ye estates of any mē / knowynge no parcyalyte / but ren∣dreth vnto euery man accordyng to ye workes done in his body.Romans ii. ii. Corin. v. And accordyn to the sayenge of the gos∣pell they which in ye last iudgemen shal go about to wynne the fauou of the iudge by allegacyon of old familyaryte or acquoyntaunce o of workes exteryor / to suche shal be sayde:Luke. xiii I saye vnto you truely I knowe you nat. The same thynge all be welnye requyred ī a doctou or teacher / whiche be requisyte in a prophete.A prophe¦te is a doc¦toure or teacher. Chryst is an xcel∣lent doc∣tour. For a prophete is also a doctour or teacher / lyke as he whi∣che is a kyng is also a iudge. In a doctour whiche is a teacher be re∣quisyte wysdome fidelyte autho∣ryte / and lyuynge according to his
doctryne or learnynge.Coloss. ii In onely Chryste was all fulnes of dyuyne sapyence or wysdome / he was both a faythfull and ryght prudent dis∣trybuter of mysteryes celestyall / which dyd bryng forth of his trea∣surye thynges bothe newe & olde. And as touchyng authorite it was neuer sayd absolutely of any other than of Chryste / whose wordes all were spryte & lyfe:The au∣thorite of chryst. heare you hym. Therfore ye {pro}phet doth recyte thoseIohn̄. vi. crymes or defautes chefely / which all ye {per}sonages before shewed & cō∣teynedMatthe xvii. in christ are wont to be sub∣get vnto & fautye of. So that all ye whole worlde shulde vnderstande that in conclusyon one man shulde come which shulde parfitly declare him selfe to be an innocēt kyng / a preest throughly & in all poyntes pure / a {pro}phete in al thinges iuste & true / a doctour or teacher teaching other men nothīg / which he hȳ selfe
dyd nat in dedes {per}fourme a iudg vncorrupte.gayste vnwryt∣en vey∣ies and tradicy∣ons of men. So that there is nothynge yt we oughte to seke in thi lyfe without or besydes chryste. I is no nede to tell that to all men is knowen / yt is to wytte howe grea harme dyuers kinges do vnto me by reason of theyr power & cruelte / Whan they polle the people wit vnryghtfull exaccyons / whan the do breake good lawes and mak euyll / whā they moue vniust warres / whan they harken to tale bearers and promoters or false accusers / whā they rage and shewe ry∣goure to innocente and harmeless people / whā for money they do cō∣mytte or gyue offyces to men vn∣mete and vnworthye. But let vs leaue to speake of discommendable prynces and preestes of whiche is a passynge great nombre. With howe great and noble testimonyes of scrypture was Moyses anour∣ned
/ agaynst whome natwithstan∣dyng was obiecte the cryme of im∣piete and wyckednes / for becauseN. xx. whan the people dyd thurste after waters he dyd nat glorifye god / & therfore it was nat graunted hym to entre in to the lande of promyse / howe soeuer he be excused for kyl∣lynge the Egypcyan.Exodi. ii. Nother was it any small blotte in Aaron that he folowed the mynde of the peo∣ple requyryng ydolles or false god∣des to be made them.Exodi. xxxii. Dyd nat Da¦uid of whome remayneth this no∣ble testimonye of goddes worde (Iii. of yn¦ges. iii. haue founde a man occordynge to myne owne appetite & harte) ioyne a detestable cryme with his cruel∣nes that is to saye, adulterye with murther?i. of Pa∣lippo. xxvii. He was called a man of blode or blody man / and recounted vnworthy to buylde a tēple to the lorde.iii. of ki¦ges. ii. Salomon receyued an excel∣lent testimonye of scripture / but wt
howe many crymes and outragy∣ous dedes dyd he obuscate and dymine that glory. Two ryght fa∣mous and soueraigne men haue I noted & shewed vnto you / the other do I nat mencyon of lesse I shulde be ouer prolixe and tedyous. But he whiche is our Dauid and very ryght kynge of Syon where as he had a kyngdome sempiternall and vncorruptible / yet natwithstāding accordynge to the prophecye of za∣charyezacharye ix. he came nat agaynst vs but for vs / nat with violence and ty∣ranny but with ryghtwysenes / no∣ther beynge an oppressor of ye peo∣ple but a sauyour / nother came he dredefully by reason of fearcenes or statelynes / but myldely & quiet∣ly syttynge vpon an asse. Nowe all though other shulde be broughte forth beyng neuer so moche lauda∣ble & cōmendable / & anourned wt the testymonyes of ryghtwysnes /
yet they all beynge compared to Chryst be synners.Psal. l. Euery man is conceyued in iniquyte (of ye virgyn Mary do I gyue no sentēce) eueryyet was she saued by chryst & his deth Luke. . one is borne the chylde of yre and wrath / euery one doth beare about concupiscence beynge faste roted in y• nature of man / all though none other spotte shuld cōtamynate our lyfe. But of these wyll I make no longe rehersall / seyng it sufficyent yt I haue now shewed you ye vyces before named / vnto ye which many of those {per}sonages amonge y• iewes were subget & fautye of / which {per}so∣nages al we do fynde in christ hyly reuerēt & worshipful. This is here to be noted yt the argument of this psalme doth nat differre from y• ar∣gumēt or mater of y• psalme goyng before. For whā he there had recy∣ted howe mankynde was on eueryRomans iii. syde corrupte / and howe that godGala. iii. hadde concluded and compassed
all thynges vnder synne to thentent that he shulde take mercy vpon all: He there also consyderyng that nother the lawe was sufficyē to pacefye so great wrathe of go conceyued agaynst vs (which law dyd rather prouoke the wrathe o Romans iii. & .iiii.god agaynste vs than pacefye o aswage it) nor that any sacrefyce prescrybed of Moyses were to thi sufficyent: But that we had nead of a newe kynge godly myghtye stronge which shulde do awaye th tyrannye of Satan / and that w had neade of a newe preest which shulde be voyde of all spottes tha so he shulde offer a sacrefyce farr more effectuall than was the blod of beastes / and yet he coulde fynd no suche preest amonges all mankynde / he beynge conuerted to go doth thus make exclamacyon: wh shal gyue saluacyon or helth to Israel of or from Syon? And he heareth
answere agayne: whan ye lorde shall turne awaye the captiuyte of is people / Iacob shal reioyse and sraell shall be glad. In ye mounte of Syon as we haue shewed before was bothe the tabernacle and the ynges palace. In whiche bothe is signyfyed the church which is also called the kyngdome of heauen / & in to whiche who souer be admyt∣ed or chosen they be called by thei. Peter. ii. estymonye of saynt Peter an holy acyon & a royall preeshode. But what a captiuyte was that whiche dyd nat suffre the Israelytes to be lad and reioyse? For at that tyme he people of Israell whiche were Hebrues were captyue or ī seruitu∣ to no maner of men.Gala. iii. & .iiii. But it was a sore captiuyte to be vnder ye ma∣ediccyon of the lawe whiche was n harde scole mayster to the peo∣le wantyng the spryte.ii. Corin. iii. For where oeuer the spryte is nat / there also
is no lybertie or franchyse. And where as the terrore of the law dothe manace vengeaunce ther is no pure gladnes of harte. Fo because therfore there was no ho∣pe of saluacyon in men the fathe dyd sende his only begotten sonn beynge more myghty than the deuyll beyng a tyrante / which shuld auerte & put awaye the captiuyt of his people delyuerynge or ma∣kynge vs fre by grace from ye ma∣lediccyon of the lawe. He sent hy beynge a preest full of efficacy Hbrues v.whiche makynge intercessyon fo his electe shuld be graciously her for loue of his reuerence and god¦lynes. And thus in conclusyon dy Iacob reioyse and Israell wa glad and ioyfull. Iacob & Israe be the names of one man / all be  that here accordyng to the custom of scripture they be vsed for ye peple of Israell. Furthermore bote
the wordes do signyfye a wrestler / for Iacob to the Hebrues is a sup∣planter / & Israell a stronge man towarde god. Iacob truely (as is contayned in the holy historye) dyd wrastle with Esau in his mothers belly.Genes. xxv. The same dyd also wrastle with the angell / for the whiche wrastlynge he obtayned the nameGenes. xxxii. of Israell. For I sayth he wyll nat let the departe excepte thou shalte blesse me. His brother beynge sup∣planted / he dyd obtayne his fa∣thers blessynge: He inforsynge the angell dyd purchase the blessynge of god. Nother oughte it to be thought any inconuenyence if a man be sayd to wrastle with god / seynge we do heare our sauyoure hym selfe sayenge in ye gospell thatMatthe. xi. the kyngdome of heuen doth suffre violence / and that men violently cōmynge to it do pulle it to them. The Samaritans and gentles or
infydeles dyd russhe in to it before theyr tyme / & as a man wolde say the dors broken vp.Matth. x. For fyrst was the lorde sent vnto the loste shepe of the house of Israell. But wha vyolence is that by which ye kyng∣dome of heuen is with violence ouercome?The kīg¦dome of god how it is go∣tn with violence. It is fayth a thynge myghtye and importune / whiche in a maner doth wreste out frō god that no merytes do purchase or ob∣tayne. atthe. xv.Doth nat the womā of Ca∣nanye ī a maner appere to wrastle with the lorde Iesu / prouokynge hym with importune crye to heare to heare her / whan he pretended that he wolde nat.Of the omā of Canante wrase∣ling with chryst. Agayne whan she was dryuen from hym beynge called by the rebukefull name of a dogge / yet dyd she stylle craue for cromes naming her selfe a whelpe. Doth nat she than appere to saye with Iacob: I wyll nat let ye de{per}te except thou shalt blesse me? Forth∣with
there after whā ye lorde sayth: O woman great is thy fayth be it vnto ye as thou wylte haue it / both it nat appere to be the worde or voyce of a mā ouercome in wrast∣lyng? Wyl ye thā heare howe puys∣sant pugnant and victoryous a thynge faith is?The pu∣ysance & vertue of fayth. Onely sayth he be∣leue for all thynges are possyble to hym yt beleueth.Marke. ix. But for to returne frō this digressyon to a shorte con∣clusion. Lyke as in ye psalme before ye prophete doth demaūde after the saluacion of mākynde sayeng who shal arise to helpe & remedy ye world beyng so desperate: In like fassyon doth he heare crye sayeng: O lorde who shal abyde ī thy tabernacle / or who shal reaste in thy holy moun∣tayne? In yt he nameth a taberna∣cle he requireth an hye preest / and whan he nameth a holy moūtayne he desyreth a kynge of more puis∣saūce thā is ye puissaūce of Satan /
and he heareth answere made to hym of the sprite: he whiche entreth without spotte and dothe worke ryghtwysenes. By the which testi∣monye or prayse is signyfyed the persone of Christ which onely with out all excepcyon was pure & clene frō all blemyshe or spotte. Whose doctryne doth sauer of no vylenes or basenes / but as it dyd come frō heuen euen so doth it vtter & speke heuenly thynges.Mounte Syon wherof it is so de¦nomina∣te. Mounte Syon hath his denominacyon or name of speculacyon or beholdynge / In whiche who souer dothe reaste he beynge hyer than all thynges ter∣restryall or earthly doth beholde & desyre no thynges but celestyall. And he dyd nat only worke ryght∣wysenes which in all poyntes dyd accomplisshe the workes of his fa∣ther / but he also wrought ryght∣wysenes for vs and to vs. For vn∣to i. Corin. ivs saith ye Apostle was he made
ryghtwysenes whiche nother had any of our owne / nother coulde haue any / in lykewyse as we can nowe also haue none of our owne or propre. Thus hytherto haue I applyed this psalme vnto the per∣sone of Chryste. Nother do they a∣mysse whiche do interprete this psalme of the lyfe heuenly. For in heauen also is bothe a temple and a tabernacle / in which without in∣intercessyon or cessynge is offered the sacrefyce of prayse and of than∣kes gyuyng / lyke as is sayd in an other psalme: Blessyd be they whi∣che do dwell in thy house O lorde / Psalme. lxxxiii. in worlde without ende shall they prayse the. The gospell also dothe make mencyon of tabernacles ad∣uertysyng vs that we shulde heare purchase vs fryndes with ye Mā∣monLuke. xvi of iniquyte whiche shulde re∣ceyue vs beyng destytute and suc∣courles in to euerlastynge taber∣nacles.
There therfore is ye templ of god thorowly pure and wholy / there is y• mounte Syon in which the veyle taken awaye we shall se the glorye of god presently / there is the holy cytie of Hierusalem for there is fynally parfyte and true reaste. But in to this temple and in to this palace is none entrance or ingate by ceremonyes or the Popes Agaynste ceremo∣nyes and the po∣pes bul∣les. Matthe. xxv.bulles / but by a mynde pure∣fyed by faythe / hauynge no euyll cōscience / & by the dedes of charyte which done vnto our neyghbour / Chryste wylleth them to be impu∣ted done to hym.

ouercme ye deuyll / as by cōtempte of thynges vyle and corruptyble they fynde reaste in hope of thyn∣ges heuenly and celestyall. This thynge in the meane waye is to b obserued and noted (all though i doth appere of smalle importance that this worde Entre in / i nat heare vsed as the contrarye t goynge out. Whiche worde hau yet deceyued some interpretyng that we be made immaculate by  very entrynge / and that by baptysme we do entre into the church Nother is it wrytten Eselthei bu Porefetai which is to saye goyng passyng or walkīg lyke as it is dclared ī an other passage:Psalme. C.xviii. Blessy are they whiche be immaculate i the waye / whiche do walke in th lawe of the lorde.Erodi. xiiii. For after that w dyd forsake Egypte / and dyd leau or put of all our spottes in ye redd see / this is remaynyng that we d
from henseforth walke pure & im∣maculate vntyll we do come vnto that blessyd lande / which god hath promysed to men perseuerynge in the loue of hym. To stande in the waye of the lorde is to go backe∣warde.To stāde in the waye of the lorde is to go backe∣warde / & yet is there acō¦mēdable stādyng. Philip. ii Paule dyd walke whihe forgettynge those thynges yt were left behynde hym dyd stretche hym selfe to those thynges whiche were before hym. Natwithstandynge some standyng is yet cōmendable. For so wryteth Paule sayenge: Stande ye in the faythe in whiche ye be called that is perseuer you / nat so that you shulde nat go for∣warde to thynges more parfyte / but that ye do nat fall backewarde to worse thynges. There is also a ronnynge in the waye of vertue & godlynes as is shewed in ye psal∣mes:Psalme. C.xviii. I haue ronne the waye of thy cōmaundemētes whan thou dyd∣dest dilate or comfort myne harte.
And in the cantycles or balades o Salomon:canticles fyrst. we shall rōne in ye odr or swete sauoure of thy oyntementes. And yu Apostle sayth:i. Corin∣theos. i. So rōn that ye may obtayne. He walketh  goeth forwarde. He stādeth whic perseuereth in goodnes beynge i readynes agaynste the assautes o sculkewatch of the deuyll. He dot ronne whiche wt great luste & courage / and wt stronge feruentness of the spryte is rauisshed to do th workes of fayth & godlynes. An lyke degrees be in the waye of th wycked. He is iudged blessed whiche doth nat walke in the waye o the wycked and vngodly.Psal. i. This i the fyrst degree to wyckednes an impiete: And doth nat stande or cōsyste in the way of synners / this i the seconde degree of men perseueryng in euyll: Nother doth sytte i in the chayre or seate of pestylence And this is ye thyrde degree of men
whiche do glorye in all euyll thyn∣ges & vngracyousnes. The way of the wycked hath also a propre ron∣nynge:Isay. lix. The feate sayth he of them doth ronne vnto myschefe. Nowe is there a certayne vayne & turne∣sycke walkyng / of which the scrip∣ture doth mencyon sayenge:Psal. xi. The wycked do walke in a circuyte or ambage. For whan they be caryed about with desyres & cōcupiscence of vayne and transitory thynges / so that the more they gette or pur∣chase ye more they desyre & luste for / & whā they be caryed from one lust or desyre to an other / as from the y• loue of ryches to ambicyon & to ye desyre of honoures / or to worldly pleasures neuer fyndyng y• can sa∣tisfye or cōtent theyr mȳde / do they nat seme or appeare to be rolled or tourned vp set downe in a circuyte or cyrcle? Therfore who soeuer wyll walke pure and immaculate
he muste walke within the taber∣nacle. For without the churche b euen those thynges maculate and foule whiche do appere bryght & clere. Bothe Heretykes & Scys∣matykes do faste / saye psalmes / gyue almes / lyue chaste / prea∣che the worde of god / and exercse suche other dedes whiche hau the shewe or semblaunce of vertue and godlynes. But all thes thynges for so moche as they b done without the tabernacle / the be nothynge els than spottes an blottes. And they whiche do sek very true reaste ought nat to departe from the holy mountayne o god in which is buylded the churche. The prophete hath in this on lyttelll verse as is sayde before cōprehēded vnyuersally all vertues He whiche entreth without spott & dothe worke ryghtwysenes. Th fyrst poynt is to wante al crymes
and the secōde to anourne thy lyfe with good workes. The fyrste is wrought by fayth in ye lorde Iesn / the other is caused by charite whi∣che is the cōpanyon of pure fayth.Matth. xii. Nother is it surely accordynge to the parable of the gospell to leaue the house swepte and made clene / voyde or emptye / but it muste be anourned & garnysshed with dy∣uers stuffe and apparayle of good workes / leaste ye ende be worse thā the begynnynge. There be some whiche haue meruaylously extol∣led the vertue of faythe / nother be they ī this deceyued / they do iudge faythe to be of full hye value and power / but holy scripture do nat without a cause cōmende vnto vs full greatlye in dyuers and many places good workes. Scripture doth calle all synne spottes. Nowe do all spottyng remayne in ye hart / and out of suche spottynge in the
harte as out of the rote do workes sprynge & aryse: There is the foun∣tayne of al our workes and dedes / the veyne wherof if it be syncere / i spryngeth forth fyrst in to ye tonge  & so therafter in to workes. Such a veyne had he whiche sayde:Psalme. xliiii. My tonge hathe bolked out a good worke. But yf this veyne be īfect it bubbleth or boyleth out fyrst i to speche and wordes / and so fort in to workes pestiferous. And th murren or spottes of the harte d russhe out in none other wyse / thā the very pockes do floure & bugene out in to the skynne of them  whiche haue the inner partes o theyr body infecte with euyll and noysome humoures. As for exam∣ple heresye is a foule spotte / and s is diffidencye a foule blotte / to hat our neyghbour is a foule thynge & the loue of money or of volupe is fylthy. Suche spottes whyle
they lay hydde in the harte they do defyle him onely which hath them without infectynge of other / but they can nat abyde longe hydde. For whan the preuye euyll shal be faste roted it wyl breath out pesty∣lente speache / and breake forthe in to abhomynable dedes. There is also a spotte whiche we all haue taken of y• poysone of olde Adam. Fynally concupiscence whiche we feale innerly fastened and implā∣ted in our flesshe maye ryghtully be called a spotte.Euyden signes of cōcupys∣cence shewed euen ī in∣fantes. Of whiche con∣cupiscence we do se euen in some babes and infantes an euydent prynte or simylytude as the prynte of Enuye / of Wrath / & of vengea∣blenes. Whiche affeccyons whan they can nat expresse in wordes yet do they shewe them in why∣nynge / weapynge / & channyyng / or chatterynge / and in theyr fro∣warde coūtynaūce. So that saynt
Augustyne was nat wtout a caus brought ī to doubtfulnes whethe that age of infancye was coinquy∣nate nat onely with y• synne called oryginall / but also with the synn whiche is called {per}sonall or actuall Seynge than it is thus some may thus make obieccyon howe may it "agre to vs, To entre without spot seynge that Iohn̄ the Euangelys spekynge of suche as be regenerat in Chryst doth playnly testefye:Howe chrysten men be potted & also with out spot¦tes. 1 Iohn̄. i. I we shal saye that we haue no synn we do deceyue our selues and th truth of god is nat in vs. Saynt Paule also doth crye out sayengeRomans vii. O wretched man that I am wh shall delyuer me from this body o deth? If synne be in vs howe sha we be called immaculate or with out spotte? Euen they whiche  ryghtewyse haue spottes / for e shulde they nat crye vnto the fther:Matthe. vi. Forgyue vs our trespasse
lyke as we forgyue them whiche haue trespassyd agaynste vs. Who is he whiche dothe nat often tymes and cōmenly offende god? Or who is he whiche at some tyme doth nat vexe & greue his neygh∣bour? But suche spottes whiche be in suche men dothe the flesshe that is so whyte as snowe of the immaculate lambe Iesus Chryste couer.Romans viii. For there is no dampna∣cyon to those persones whiche be in Iesu Chryste.Romans xiii. Nat in cham∣berynges (sayth the Aoostle) and in Lecherye or vnclennes / nat in surfettynges and dronkenes / And thus do you heare of spottes / but put ye on the lorde Iesu Chryste in which you may parceyue a coue for the spottes of mankynde. O our selues we be all spottye / but in Chryste we be immaculate and without spotte / yf so we abyde in hym.
And the psalmyst doth reporte thē Psalme. xxxi.to be blessyd whose syn̄es be coue∣red / and to whome the lorde hath nat imputed or layde syn̄e to theyr charge. And nowe do I speke of ye synnes which by the infyrmyte of men can nat be auoyded. For Le∣cherye or vnclennes dronkenes & surfettynge or glotony with suche lyke crimynal synnes or outrages be ones couered in Baptysme / bu therafter do nat they agree with y• flesshe of the lambe immaculate. Who soeuer hath cōmytted a deedly synne / he hathe caste awaye th whyte garment or crysome which he dyd take in Baptysme / & hath put on the blacke vesture or gar∣ment of the deuyll / Natwithstan∣dynge yt they in whiche doth dwel the vertue and power of fayth d lyghtly retourne to theyr olde innocencye nat by Baptysme but b repentaunce. And excepte they d
repent all though they do appeare to abyde in the tabernacle by pro∣fessyng of the catholyke fayth and cōmunyon of the sacramentes / yet in very dede they do nat abyde or dwell in ye tabernacle of the lorde. The ryghtewyse man therfore whiche doth abyde or dwell in the tabernacle of god and doth reaste in his holy mountayne / after that he hathe forsaken Egypte he doth nat cease / but the fyre or lyght of god shynynge before hym he doth alwaye walke beyng immaculate vnto perfeccyon vntyll yt he shall attayne & come vnto that stable & vnmouable blysse & felicyte / whi∣che is signyfyed by the fygure of the lande of beheste. It partay∣neth to innocēcye to hurte no mā. And charyte wyll be ready to pro∣fyte or helpe all men. And therfore it foloweth: And doth worke ry∣ghtwysenes."what ry∣ghtwyse¦nes doth signefye in scryp∣ture. Ryghtwysenes in the
scripture is comenly thus vsed & taken / nat yt it shulde be one parte of the morall or cardynall vertues distyncte from prudence fortytude and temperance / but that it shulde be taken for all maner of good do∣ynge:Ezechiel. xviii. I shal saith he nat remembre al his ryghtwysenes. And in Esay:Isay. lviii. And ryghtwysenes shall go before thy face / where as a lytle before he had reckened vp the dedes of cha∣ryte towarde our neyghboure say∣ynge: Breake vnto the hongry thy bredde. &c. All the lyfe of Chryste what other thynge was it than bountefulnes and good doynge alwayes open and ready to helpe all men. So that it becommeth hym whiche hathe put on Chryste to folowe so farforth as he may so well the parfyte bountefulnes or good doynge of Chryste as hys perfyte innocencye / lyke as tea∣cheth
saynt Iohn̄ sayenge:i. Iohn̄. ii he whi∣che sayth that he abydeth in Christ oughte to walke / lyke as Chryste walked. Thus hathe the prophe∣te in one verse comprehended the summe of all godlynes and ver∣tue / nowe dothe he dyscende vn∣to the kyndes of vertues and to the specyall names of vyces sayenge: whyche dothe speake truthe in his harte / whiche hathe wroughte no gyle or deceyte with hys tonge. The moost parte both of good and also of euyll wor∣kes is wroughte with the tonge. In the very mynde is also a tonge with whyche the mynde dothe speake to it selfe and to god. From the harte dothe procede lyfe and dethe. It skylleth therfore very moche what thynges euery man dothe speake with hym selfe in his harte. Nouther can he speake
true thynges to his neyghboure / which doth lye or speke falsely vn∣to hym selfe in his owne harte / True thynges I saye nat onely whiche be contrarye to falseheed / but whiche be spoken symplye / sin∣cerely / and with harte and mynde. The Pharises whā they sayd vn∣to Chryst:Matthe. x.i. Myster we wote that thou teachet y• wye of god true∣ly and thou regardest no mannes estate. In this they sayde no false thynges yet dyd they nat speake true thynges / for somoche as they spake with a gyleful and disceyte∣full mynde. And Dauus in a pro∣phane or secular comedye doth worke disceyte in speakynge true thynges / whiche is a kynde of ly∣ynge most vngracyous or mysche∣uous.Truthe disceyte∣fullye or vntruely spokē is a kynde of lyynge most per∣nicyous. How mā begyleth him self with lies which he speaketh to hym selfe. In this wyse do many speke vnto them selues in theyr harte law ghynge or smylynge at theyr owne vyces / theyr conscyence yet
repynynge. But deth approchyng doth vrter and bewray theyr false∣hede or lyenge. For than are they vexed and tormented and be fayne to cōfesse that they before haue nat spoken truely in theyr harte / but yt they haue wt flatery or fayre wor∣des disceyued them selues. Thus doth it vsually come to passe to su∣che as by pardones haue purcha∣sydAgaynste pardons remyssyon of all theyr synnes / or to suche as by defraudynge o good men by thefte and by brybery wyll seke y• iustefyenge as they call it of thynges gotten. But he whi∣che without fraude or dissymula∣cyon dothe speke the truthe in his hart / suche one euyn whan y• parell of deth dothe pynche hym obtay∣neth styll his former & olde hope or confydence. The folysshe man which hath vsed to say in his harte there is no god hath pernicyously spoken lyes vnto hym selfe.Psalme xiii. Also
heretykes whiche do persuade vn∣to them selues false doctrynes / & vpon the same do promyse to them selues trāquillyte of mynde / suche do speake to them selues falseheed & lyes. To be shorte all they which do beheste to them selues any fely∣cyte in this lyfe / the same do nat speke the truth in theyr harte. The ryche mā mencyoned of in the gos∣pell dyd deceyue & lye to hym selfe sayeng:Luke. xii. Soule thou haste moche goodes enioye thou them many yeares longe / where as yet he was inforsyd in the same nyght to gyue vp the ghoste & to departe or dye: Who soeuer doth thynke or right∣fully iudge of ye artycles of ye fayth doth speke the truthe in his harte:Agaynste re wyll. Who soeuer doth knowledge that by his owne power he can do no∣thynge / but that all his helpe and supportacyon is of the free mercye of god: Who soeuer doth confesse
or acknowledge his synne and with a syncere mynde dothe de∣syre the mery of the lorde / the sme doth speake the truth in his harte: Who soeuer dothe speake false thynges in his harte dothe deceyue hym selfe / but who souer dothe beare or worke disceyte or gyle in his tonge / he dothe dys∣ceyue his neyghboure. Agayne∣warde he which speaketh the truth in his harte dothe profyte hym selfe: And he which hath his tonge voyde of all gyle dothe edeye his neyghboure / So that the one fo∣loweth vpon the other. For howe shall he whiche lyeth to hym selfe in his harte speke true thynges to his neyghboure? And lyke as by this halfe verse: He whiche dothe speake the truthe in hys harte is excluded all errore all peruerse oppynyons / all euyll
yea and also ydle thoughtes or co∣gitacyons All ydle∣nes is falsehede & vanyte.(for all thyng is false & vayne what soeuer is ydle) and a∣gaynewarde as by the same half verse be vnderstāde all godly opi∣nyons / all affeccyōs pure and vn∣corrupte / Euen so by ye other halfe verse, Whiche hath nat wrought gyle or deceyte in his tonge, is ex∣cluded euery worde which hurteth our neyghbour. All thynge is dis∣ceyte or gyle which doth hurte the soule. By the same particle is also excluded as I haue shewed euery vayne or ydle worde. For euery thynge whiche profyteth nat doth hurte.Matth. v. The lorde cōmaundeth that our cōmunycacyon shulde be yea yea and naye naye / that is to saye we shulde afferme nothynge but that is true / nor denye any thynge but that is false.olo. iiii And Paule dothe bydde that our speache shulde al∣wayes be wel fauoured & poudred
ith salte.ol. iii. The same also byddeth that we shulde deceyue no mā with lyenge / but that we shulde speke y• ruthe amonges our selues and to all men. If it {per}tayneth to Christen purenes nat to disceyue y• infydels or myscreantes with disceytefull wordes / Is it nat than a shame to vs Chrysten people to se so fewe a∣monge vs whiche with harte do speke truely to our neyghbour? Is nat all the occupyenge of the peo∣ple abrode cōmonly full of fraude / disceyte / and lyenge? Howe many be there whiche for loue of a lytle lucre wyll nat blynde and begyle his neyghbour? Nother hath done euyll to his neyghbour. Passynge moche myschefe is wrought with the tonge / and from the speche of the tonge we do come to euyll de∣des / of whiche the tonge is the en∣tyser and procurer. Natwithstan∣dyng it is somwhat to abyde with
in dceyuablenes wought by t tonge & nat to passe it. Thou has sclaundered thy neyghboure an woūded hym with thy tonge / add thou nt there vnto euyll doyng whiche is wrought with thy hād  or wt other thy membres. It shul seme but a werisshe or fynte pray∣se / yt he hathe nat done euyll vnt his neyghboure / but as I hau shewed tofore one contrarye is t be vnderstande by an other.One con¦trary vn¦derstande by an o∣ther. So  the ryghtwyse man which is repoted to haue done euyll to his ne∣yghbour is vnderstāde he whiche hath holpen his neyghboure with all maner of gentylues and honest dedes.In omyt¦tynge to helpe our neygh∣bour we do hurte hym. For he hath hurte his neighbour & done to hym euyll / who so euer hathe nat holpen hym & done hym good whan nede was / & that he so mought. Lyke as gyle or dis∣ceyte is also wrought wt the tonge / so often as charyte dothe requyre
good doynge / and the same dothe nat her offyce in well doynge. As for example thou hearest thy ne∣yghbour to be sclaundered & thou oste holde thy peace or doste nat speke / thou hast in yt cōmitted gyle with thy tonge.By sy∣lence ke∣pyng we do often speke de∣ceyte a∣gaynste our ne∣yghbo. Thou seest thy frynde in errore & doste nat warne hym therof / disceyte is so cōmytted with thy tonge / & by sylence or nat speakynge thou speakest fraude and disceyte. In lyke wyse thou doste se thy neyghbour to be hurte and iniured / & thou (where as thou mayste) doste nat helpe hym / thou so doste to thy neyghbour wronge and iniurye. Also thou doste se thy neyghboure to be payned with nede and penurye / & thou doste nat socour hym whā yu haste wherwith to do it / in so leauyng hȳ vnsocou∣red yu hast spoyled & robbed him. It is thefte & robbery yt thou doste in leauing thy duety vndone. Behold
nowe whether y• parcell folowyng doth agree to this sence or no? And he hath nat enterprised an sclaūder agaynst his neyghbours Thon doste appere to thy selfe innocente & harmelesse in that (wha other do brynge vp a rebuke o sclaunder vpon your neyghboure thou arte styll and doste kepe sylence.In howe many wayes a man doth sclaunder his neigh¦boure. But a ryghtwyse man is na onely ware leaste he shulde sclaunder or rebuke an other man / but h also wyll nat suffre or wynke at it yf an other man shall sclaunder a innocente. He that holdynge hi peace wyll wynke to se or heare hi brother infamed / the same doth cause and worke the infamye. H is nat onely infamed or sclaundre whiche is reuyled and ignomynyouslye spoken vpon / but also whsoeuer is moued or prouoked to d synne.They sclaunder men whi¦che do en¦se them to synne. They which do moue a ma to dronkennes / do go about to d
great reproche & villanye to theyr frynde / and he whiche dothe nat mysproue or blame the entyser or mouer (whan it is oportunyte) in reuokynge or withdrawynge the man entysed or moued hath enter∣prysed to sclaūder his neyghbour. He whiche doth tempte a mayde to Lechery or vnclennes / doth cause great ignomynye and sclaunder. And he whiche in suche a case doth nat tell the man temptynge of his defaute / & doth nat helpe y• mayde beyng in parell or redy to fall with good counsayle / the same doth be∣gynne to sclaunder his neyghbour makynge hym selfe pertaker of an other mans cryme or trespasse. Some man wyl yet peraduenture thynke that forsomoche as ye world is full of men temptynge and pro∣uokynge to vyces / yf a ryghtwyse or iuste man shuld assaye to repre∣hende or admonysshe them all / he
els coulde do nothing / & yet shulde he gette to hym selfe mortall hate & displeasure. But I answere that the qualyte of some persone dothe excuse our sylence.whan we shall be excused thoughe we do nat reprhēde synne in wordes The sonne of a man beynge yonge doth nat synne if he doth nat rebuke his father or mother / or if a chylde shulde kepe hym sylente before his elder / or if a subgette and man of lowe degree doth nat mysproue or reprehende a prince. The place also doth other whyle excuse our sylence. As no mā dothe reprehende the preacher in churches: and to reprehende one before many shuld rather chafe the mysdoer than correcte or amende hym / In especyall if in the same nombre be suche persones present / before whome it is nat expedyente that the authoryte of the man tres∣passynge be hyndered or dimynys∣shed / as if the chyldren of an hous∣holder or the subgettes of a prynce
shulde be presente. The doctryne of the gospell doth also teache this moderacyon of reformynge or ad∣monicyon gyuyng / so that the fyrst admonicyon shulde wante testes / the secōde shulde admytte .ii. or .iii.Matthe xviii. and the thyrde shulde be presented before the church or congregacion. Generally where as appeareth no hope of amendement it is lefll to kepe sylēce. Intercessyon or prayer doth often tymes worke the same thynge that a rebuke shulde do or chydynge. Nowe is this kynde of reprehensyon or rebukynge graū∣tedRepre∣hēsion of synne by shewyng of doo in coūty∣naunce. to al men / to signyfye by heuy∣nes of countenaunce that he dothe nat cōmende those thynges which be done or sayd. Contrary wyse do they whiche with a mery cheare do heare a backebyter or sclaūderous body / whiche do reioyse in fowle or rybaldy ales / which do smyle vp∣on seruyle flatterers / or estynge
byters. From suche maners dothe the ryghtwyse man full greatlye abhorre.Ecclesi∣asticus. xxviii. He dothe close his eares with thornes yt he shulde nat heare the wordes of men sclaunderynge or backebytyng theyr neyghbour. Many haue delyte in obtrectacyon or to heare backebyters countynge the vitupery or blame of other to be theyr laude and prayse. With suche be tale bearers set by whome the iuste and ryghtwyse man doth abhorre and defye. For in the pre∣sence of hym (as heare sayth y• pro∣phete) is the malygner brought to nought. It is extreme contempte to counte one for noughte or no∣thynge.what a maligner is. He is a malygner and en∣uyous persone whiche dothe nat suffre the honeste fame or name of his neyghbour / but in what soeuer wyse he can doth spotte or blotte it.A malyg¦ner is in dyuerse wayes broughte to nou∣ghte. Suche one is dyuers wayes brou∣ght to nought / as whan he outher
is openly contemned / or whan he is chastysed for euyll spekynge / or els whan he is with holden frome that vyce by wholesome admoni∣cyon.whan a malgner is blessyd¦ly and for his welth brought to nou∣ghte. He is blessydly broughte to nought whiche of an euyll speaker is made a good speaker / of a repre∣hender or rebuker a prayser or cō∣mender / of an enuyous or malicy∣ous man gentle & innocent.A backe∣byter or euyll spe∣ker is a great pes¦tylence. But the iuste man for because he dothe knowe howe great a pestylence a backebyter or euyll speaker is in this life wyll whytesaue to gyue to such one none honour / but he doth flye from hym abhorrynge hym. The venyme (sayth he) of addersPsalme. xiii. is in theyr lyppes / theyr tethe be weapons and arowes / and theyrPsalme. lvi. tonge is a sharpe swearde / theyr mouthe is full of cursyd speache & bytternes / theyr wyne is the galle of dragons.Deter. xi. What thynge can be more horryble than suche a beaste?
If at any tyme he loketh or spea∣keth fayre / he reacheth forthe the gall of dragons for wyne.A malyg¦ner is a beaste most hor∣ryble. If he onely dothe breathe vpon the / he breatheth poyson or venyme. If he byteth / his tethe be arowes dyp∣ped in venyme. If he smyteth with his tōge / he sleeth with a swearde. If he openeth his lyppes / he pow∣reth out ye venyme of aspes / or ra∣ther a poyson that is worse or mor hurtefull than ye venyme of aspes.The ve∣nym of a maligner is many wayes  mo¦re hurte∣full than the ve∣nym of addrs. Psalme. C.x.x. The styngynge of an aspe or adde doth slee the body onely / but this venyme doth kylle the soule / wher∣fore the prophete beynge a frayde therof doth crye: Delyuer O lorde my soule from vngracious lyppes and from a gylefull tonge. He is a ferde of hys soule and nat of hys body. An aspe or adder all though he dothe slee with styngynge / yet doth he cause an easy deth and no∣thynge paynefull. For he that is
tynged is broughte therby in to a leape / and that so without all ma∣ner of payne / that he doth dye with some fealynge of pleasure. But it is a deth most cruell that a sclaun∣derer doth cause. Whose venyme is thā the more sore and venymous / whan it is cloked with the coloure or apparence of amyte and bene∣uolence.The ve∣nym of a maligner is than moste ve¦nymous whan it is cloked with ap∣parēce of amyte. There be some whiche be∣fore one be louesome & flatteryng / but they powre out priuely beynge with other men deedly poysone. There wyll they make couenante for sylence to be kepte / whiche sy∣lenceThe ma∣lygner doth re∣quyre sy∣lence per¦uerse. they do vnwysely requyre of other / seynge they them selues can nat kepe it. They tell to one / and after to an other / and so often to one and to other that euery man doth knowe it / and there secrete huszynge & buszynge doth breake out in to a cōmen rumoure of the people. This vyce dyd scarcely ne∣uer
so sore rage as in this our ag or tyme. All the worlde is full o obloquye / nouther be any bokes more desyrouslye redde than those which be full of raylynge or maly∣cyous wordes. And nowe do they eare away the prayse of eloquēce / which be nat afrayde to shote forth all maner rebukes or opprobrye a∣gaynste euery man. But the iuste man dothe recounte all suche for moste refuse parsones and abiectes supposynge them onely precyous whiche do feare the lorde.A ryght∣wyse mā wyll nat sclaunder hys ne∣yghbour but excu∣se hys. For who soeuer doth feare and drede ye lorde he wyll nat sclaunder or distayne his neyghbour for whome ye lorde dyd dye / but suche thynges as be doubtfull doth he interprete to the beste wyse / those thynges which be well doth he gently prayse / & those thinges which be more manyfestly euyll than that they can be excused doth he yet dimynysshe if by none
other coloure / yet at ye leaste by the greatnes of the tēptacyon / sayeng thus if a like temptacyon had hap∣pened to vs we shuld haue synned more greuously. Now doth folowe ¶ Whiche sweareth to his neyghbour and doth nat disceyue hym. IT is a detestable cryme to dis∣ceyue men by periurye / whiche vyce to wante is no very greate prayse.Fidelyte of prom¦ses na holdn doth dis∣solue all good so∣ciete or e¦lyshippe But by this forsayd sayeng of the psalme is cōmended fydelyte in all promyses / without which all socyete or company in this worlde is broken and dissolued. And nowe a dayes be they takē for infamous persones whiche haue be conuycte of periurye. But if a man wolde narowly loke vpon the matter the veyle or couer of custome beynge put away he shall fynde the lyfe of
chrysten pople / on euery syde ful of periuryes.The lyfe of christē mē is mo¦re full of periurye thā many do thinke it. The abbotte doth sweare to ye monkes. The monkes do sweare to the abbote. The bys∣shoppes do sweare to ye other cler∣gye. And the clergye is sworne a∣gaynewarde to the bysshoppe. The prynce dothe sweare to his subiec∣tes / and the subiectes be agayne∣warde sworne to ye prynce. He doth sweare whiche doth take an offyce or is made a ruler. And before tyme who soeuer was made a con∣sull or sheryffe dyd adde ouer and besydes his othe an horryble exe∣cracyon or curse sayeng: I do curse or gyue me and myne from god to the deuyll / if I shall wyttynglye disceyue you / or worke ay false∣hede. The iudge dothe sweare and so doth the testis cōmynge before hym. The deuyne doth sweare ta∣kynge the authoryte of a doctour / and so fynally doth a Notary / yea
and the poore carpynter leaste I shulde further procede to make re∣hersall of all. Go thou nowe and consydre me what euery one dothe professe by his othe made / and also examyne whether they do {per}forme the thynges whiche they haue pro∣fessed or no / and I feare leaste thou shalte fynde many multytudes of false othes & periuryes.Euyl c∣stomes do make mē blynde in iugemēt. But vsage and custome doth cause that suche thinges be nat counted periuryes / only is he noted fautye of periurye which doth forsweare a thinge put to his custodye or credyte as be pledges and suche other / or whiche doth forsweare money lent to hym. Nowe all though there is made none othe betwyxte partyes / yet who so euer doth receyue any charge or offyce / the same doth se∣cretely sweare to his neyghboure / which charge excepte he shal faith∣fully performe he is nat all clere of
periurye. As who soeuer shall tak vpō him to be a legate or embassa∣toure / or to defende and pleade a mater in the lawe / or to instructe youth in learnynge and good ma∣ners / y• same doth oblige hym selfe by a secrete othe in the takynge of any suche charge that he wyll do  faythfully. A carpenter that coue∣naunteth vpon a pryce to buylde an house / all though there be none othe expressyd / yet is he bounde to perfourme it by the secrete lawe of his conscyence. A tayler whiche ta∣keth in hande to make a garment / or a goldesmyth which taketh vp∣on hym to make a cuppe / A carye or shypman whiche taketh in hād to cary or conuey marchandyse / i he doth cōmytte fraude or disceyte / he doth couple thefte with {per}iurye / all though suche maner or fourme of speche is nat had betwyxte you: wylte thou sweare to keape fidely∣te
/ and he answeareth ye wyll I sweare. Nother doth it skyll whe∣ther he doth adde this for more as∣suraunce: I do gyue me from god to the deuyll if I be nat faythfull. For he hath all ready gyuen hym selfe to the deuyll which wyttingly hath disceyued his neyghbour. I do knowe ye pykynge or pety thefte of myllers / & of caryers drynkyng out the wynes of other men. But in chrysten people oughte to be so great synceryte or prenes that a symple or syngle promyse shulde be so substanciall or weyghtye as a solempne othe. Nother ought we ccomplysshe to our neyghboure onely what soeuer thynge we do sweare / but to our enemyes also / & & to the myscreantes or infydeles / if so it be nat a thynge mischeuous r malycyous that thou haste pro∣mysed. Whiche hathe nat gyuen out his money to vsurye.Deuter xxiii. It was
a detestable cryme in ye olde lawe  if one iewe shuld lende a thynge t an other iewe intending to receyu more than the summe lent out. For it was graunted them to occupy vsurye with straūgers or alyātes But amonge chrysten people (whi∣che ought to be coupled one to an other with more strayte bandes of amyte than before tyme were th iewes) the worde or name of vsur is verely odyous and spyteful / b wolde god the thynge selfe were so spytefull detestable and abhorred The hethen Philosophers dyd also thynke vsurye to be a thinge detestable / for so moche as money t engēdre or gette money is a thing agaynste nature.Usurye hated of th hethē Phloso¦phers as a thynge contrary to nature But besydes tha kynde of vsurye whiche is cōmytted in the open face or syght of th worlde.Moche preuy v∣sury that is not so coūted of the doers Howe many bargaynes  couetous craftes to gette luker  subteltyes be there so nye approchynge
and accordynge to vsurye yt they be many tymes more wyc∣ked and euyll than it? These do we than most chefely vse / whan neces∣syte doth pynche or greue our ne∣yghbour / and in suche a case as he oughte to be holpen or releaued frely and without any mede or mo∣ney.Agaynste īgrossers of corne. The husbande or ploughman is in nede / than wyl the ryche man or vsurer for a small summe of mo∣ney bargayne with hym / that he shal euery yeare delyuer to ye ryche vsurer so moche wheate as shall come of the husbandes landes / or so moche money as the wheate is worthe. Whan men do feare small increase or renuynge to come of fruyte and corne / or whan neade of thynges necessary doth come vpō / than they which haue corne in store wyll auaunce and set vp the pryce. He whiche dothe lende out a thou∣sande crownes in syluer / that he by
the bargayne shulde receyue s moche in golde (whiche cōmonly is more in value) doth he nat manyfestly cōmytte vsurye?Agaynste auaūsers of the va¦lacyō in coynes for coue∣tousnes. From the whiche vsurye they be nat farre wyde which do procure the valua∣cyon of money to be outher dymi∣nysshed or els to be set vp or auaūsyd to thentente they may thero haue profyte and vauntage. Nou∣ther be they which do enforce they credytours to gyue them a quyttance testefyenge them fully payd and contented (whan they haue receyued but a pace of the whol summe) clere & free from the crym of vsurye. But suche false craftes of vsurye can I nowe nat recke vp. For they be infynyte / from th whiche all natwithstandynge h ought to be quyte and fre whiche wyll dwell in ye tabernacle of god Nowe if so it lyke you we may in∣terprete or declare further this
place after the morall sence. Euery gyfte of god by whiche a man may helpe his neyghbour is money.By mo∣ney maye be vnder∣stande al giftes gy¦uen to vs of god. As in example to this man is gyuen ye gyfte of eloquence or langages / to that man is gyuen learnynge and faculte to iudge thynges ryghte∣fully / to some man is gyuen a feate or cōueyance to gouerne / some can well gyue counsayle / an other is in authoryte wt the people or lordes. He that with his gyfte gyuen of god doth frely and kyndely helpe his neyghbour is to be praysed by this testymonye of scripture: Whi∣che hath nat gyuen or lent out his money to vsurye.Matthe. xxv. But here ryseth a doubte sayeng that the seruaunt in the gospell is condempned / whi∣che dyd nat gyue the money lente hym to the vsurers / Howe doth it agree that he shulde heare be pray∣sed whiche hath nat gyuen out his money to vsurye and for vaūtage
These thynges be no whytt rpugnante.Lauda∣ble vsury The lorde doth loue vsurye whiche doth brynge to hy lucre or vaūtage / but he doth he vsurye whiche the seruaunte doth gette or clayme to hym selfe. He whiche by the gyfte of eloquence or langages doth gather glorye and profyte to him selfe is ryghtwysely condempned / for the vauntage r lucre belongeth to hym which dy gyue or lende out the first stocke r lent money. But he whiche doth so distrybute ye worde of god that ma∣ny may be inflamed to the loue f god / and that in them god may e glorifyed / the same man doth execyse a laudable vsurye. And so is  be sayde of other thynges. But the uste or rightwyse man which doh cōuert all y• gyftes of god vnto  profyte of his neyghboure / for so moch as he doth knowe & acknow∣ledge ye very same poer or halyte
by which he doth profyte othe to come of goddes bountefulnes & lyberalyte and to be his gyfte / he thervpon doth ndeuer himselfe to the beste of his power to bestowe well the lordes money / but in such wyse that he yet wyll seke therfore no prayse or worldly {pro}fyte to hym selfe / but he wyll gette & brynge all y• lucre or vaūtage to god / whiche dyd lende vnto him the fyrst stocke or sūme. Thou than wylt obiecte if we muste labour frely / than is nat ye workeman worthy of his reward or hyre? yea rather shal no mā haue a more plentuous rewarde than he whiche doth frely bestowe & deale abrode the gyftes of god.Howe this is to be vnder¦stande. He hath a gracyous and bountefull detter who soeuer doth gyue out or lende for vauntage to god.The workmā is wor∣thi of his hyre. 1. Timo. v. Further∣more this sentence of the Apostle the worke man is worthye of hys mede and hyre is nat spoken
to those whiche do distrybute o deale abrode ye gyftes of god / bu Romans xv.to them which thorowe the distry∣bucyon or bestowyng of suche gyf∣tes be holpen.. Corint. ix. Such ought to gyue theyr carnall goodes to those of whome they do receyue spirituall goodes. But a faythfull steward and distrybuter shall take of the whome he hath profyted and don good to / and yet nat all thynges nor euery where / or in all places  nor of all men.Howe a faythull stewarde shall re∣ceyue of whome worldlye liuynge / but with out requi¦ryng thē as duety. This is agaynste our bene∣ficed men whiche wyll sue in the lawe for tythes whē they yet prea∣che not. He shall suche thin∣ges nat requyre as duety / but he shall loke to receyue his mede or ¦warde of god / whose worke & busynes he doth. In lyke wyse as  is to be supposed that saynt Paul dyd receyue or take at some tyme of some men some thynges / which were wyllyngly offered and gyuen i. Corin∣theos. ix.to hym / but of ye Corinthyans dy he receyue or take nothyng / and i ii. Corin. theos. xiis nat redde yt he requyred of an
man any thynge at all. No man doth lesse in vayne bestowe goodwe do nat rede that Paule e∣uer requi¦red any temporal lyuynge for prea∣chyng doynge vpon his neyghbour / than he whiche is to them beneficyall frely without respecte of any mede or vauntage. Nowe do this thyng whiche foloweth appeare to be a smale prayse: Whiche hath taken no rewardes or brybes agaynste innocentes.He was abhomynable euen amonge the infydels whiche beyng corrupte with mede or with a brybe shulde condemne innocen∣tes / or whiche for money receyued shulde oppresse an innocente with false wytnes / or if an attourney in the lawe for loue of luker & vaun∣tage shulde defende a mysdoer a∣gaynste one whome he dyd knowe to be an innocente.Agaynste false wyt¦nes & at∣tourneys ī the lawe The playntyue in a matter of lawe sweareth his forged cause or cautell to be trewe / & his attourney sweareth to sup∣port or defende it faythfully. Whi∣che
thynge wolde to god it shuld nat so often (as it is) be {per}ceyued a∣monge christen people. But this sentence of the texte dothe procede more largely.Tayng of brybes agaynste an īnocēt hath a lar¦ge intēde¦ment or sence. He doth take a brybe against an innocent who soeuer for loue of any cōmodyte or vauntag doth nat socour an innocēt whan  or where as he may. As for ensam∣ple: If thou date se thy neighbour wronged / & thou for because of on man or other doste wynke at it /  wylte nat cōsydre to ease or remedy it / than doste thou take a brybe agaynste an innocente. He that thu thynketh if I do supporte or ayd his man / he whiche oppressed him where as before he hath be to me eneficyall) wyll withdrawe hys hāde / and so wyll stoppe his maintenaūce of the ryght / than the pro∣fyte or vauntage whiche he was wonte to take / is a brybe taken agaynste an innocente. He that
oth these thynges shall neuer be oued. It is sayd he that doth / at he whiche speaketh.atth. v. God doth bhorre them of whome he is ho∣oured with lyppes. The Pharyse  dyd well knowe and per∣eue which was the hye and chefe omaundement in the lawe dothe heare of the lorde:Luke. x. Do this & thou shalte lyue. He therfore y• doth these thynges. Whiche thynges? Entre with out pot / worke that is ryght / speake the truthe in his harte & all the other thynges whiche he hath before recyted.Iames ii For they al do ioyne together / so yt if any is faylyng / all be marred. But what frute or {pro}fite shall fynally come to the worker or accōplysshe of th? He shall neuer be moued / of y• whiche wordes may be double intēdemēt or meanyng. That is he shal neuer be moued / or els if he be moued for a tyme he shal nat be moued eternlly or for euer
but he shall aryse after fallyng and shall come agayne in fauoure with god. Lyke as he whiche trusteth in the lorde shall nat be asshamed for euer / al though that for a whyle he be shamed or put to shame before men: Euen so he whiche abydeth honestly in the tabernacle of y• lord and doth reste in his holy moun∣tayne / the same shall nat be remo∣ued for euer. Lyke as is testefyed in an other Psalme: He whiche trusteth in the lorde is as mount Syon / he shall nat be remoued which abydeth in Hierusalem.Psalme. C.xxiiii. Th cyte sayth Israell of our strength / the lorde shall be set in it the walle and the fortresse. This is the onely cyte of whiche the lorde spake say∣ynge?Matthe. xvi. And the gates of helle shall nat preuayle agaynste it.Thinges condēned by thys psalme. In this psalme is condempned all exteryor worshyppyng of god which is nat coupled with very deuocyon of the
mynde / and al knowledge or lear∣nynge whiche is ioyned with cor∣rupte maners. Ieremye doth in∣treate this matter in the .vii. cha∣piter: Stande thou (sayth he) in the gate of the lordes house and prea∣che thou there this worde or mes∣sage: Heare the worde of the lorde al ye of Iuda / whiche do entre by these gates to honoure the lorde / Thus sayth the lorde of hostes the god of Israell / take you good wayes and folowe good coūsayles and I shall dwell with you in this place / trust you nat in false lyenge wordes sayeng heare is the temple of the lorde / the temple of ye lorde / the temple of the lorde / but rather amende your wayes & counsayles / if you wyll iudge ryght betwyxte man and his neyghbour / if ye wyll nat wronge the straunger the fa∣therlesse and the wydowe / if ye wyl nat shede innocente blode in this
place if ye wyll nat go awaye after straūge goddes to your owne dis∣truccyon than wyll. I dwell with you in this place and in the lande that I gaue afore tyme to your fa∣thers for euer. And a litle therafter: what thynke ye y• this house whi∣che beareth my name / is a denn of theues? Thus se you as th lorde in these wordes lyke as in other folowynge doth conceyue indignacyō wt great stomake agains those which dyd put cōfydence in y tēple & in ye ceremonyes of the tem∣ple hauyng theyr mȳde & lyfe coinuynate wt sinfulnes.Agayste ceremoni¦al {per}sones Such do na purefye y• tēple / but rather they d pollute the temple. More playnly & sharpely doth Esaye handell this matter in the fyrst chapyter. There doth god in this wyse stomake th thynge agaynst those whiche wor∣shypped him with ceremonyes of y• tēple / where as els they lyued pol∣lutely:
why offre you sayth he to me so many sacrefyces? I am ouer ful and wery of them I wold nat haue the burnte offerynges of wethers / and the fatnes of fedde beastes / and the blode of calues / and of lambes / and of gotes. Whan ye shulde come before me / who dyd requyre these thynges of youre handes / to thenten you shulde walke in my porches? Offe ye no more oblacyons thus to me in vayne / Incense is abomyna∣cyon to me / I may nat awaye with your newe mones / youre sabbotte dayes and suche solempne feastes my soule doth hate / your calendes and solempnytes they are to me paynefull and greuous. &c. Moughte nat the grosse people and rebellyous to god make an∣sweare agayne to this: What hath chaunsed the O lorde? Doste thou nowe saye: Who dydde are
or requyre these thynges of youre handes? Where as the lawe which thou haste gyuen vs by Moyses doth so dilygentlye prescrybe and appoynte to vs all these thynges promysynge great benefytes to the obseruers / and thretenynge deth to the trāsgressers. Nowe doste tho saye that incense is to the abomyn¦cyon / whiche thou dyddest befor saye was a swete odoure. Now doth thy soule hate the feastefu dayes / in whiche before thou dyd∣dest reioyse to be presente. From whense cōmeth this so great mu∣tacyon and varyete in hym / whic onely abydeth immutable? Wha answeare shall god make to th mutterynge and rebellyous peo∣ple? I am (shal he saye) immutable / but ye do nat obserue those thyn∣ges whiche I haue commaunded / nouther haue I so prescrybed thes ryghtes or ceremonyes / that yo
shulde put parfyte truste and con∣fydence of ryghtwysenes in them / but yt partely they shulde be signes by whiche you shulde be admonys∣shed / and partely thynges furthe∣rynge or promotynge vs to very vertue and holynes. Which if it be absent all other thinges be vayne / & to me be they so lytell pleasaūte / that they do prouoke me the more to wrathe.Romans vli. The lawe is spirytuall & doth requyre the workes of cha∣ryte to be done wt puryte of mȳde / which workes except they be ioyn∣tely added / let outwarde worshyp∣pynge and ceremonyes be kepte howe moche so euer you please / yet is the lawe vyolate and broken & all your doynge hypocrysye. What thynge than is it (wyll they saye) that thou chefely doste requyre of vs? Be you wasshed sayth he and made cleane.The say∣ynge of Isay ac∣cordyng to thys psalme of Dauid. This verely is the hynge whiche the psalme dothe
heare say: Which doth eire with out spotte Take awaye your euyl thought as from my syght. Which thinge is thus spoken in ye psalme: Whiche doth speake the truthe in his hart. Seke to do ryght iudge∣mente / delyuer the oppressed / hele the orphlyne or fatherlsse to the ryght / defēde the ydowe. That  psalme doth thus recorde: Whiche worketh ryghtwysenes or doth  is ryghte. The same people in th lviii. chapy. of ye same {pro}phete dot mutter agaynst god sayeng. Wh fore haue we fasted & thou hast na beholdē it?Fastyng dyscōmē∣ded. Why haue we chastise our soules & thou hast nat knowe or regarded it? But what answear do they heare agayne of ye lorde? Is the fastynge saith he which I haue chosen of such a sorte yt a man for a day shuld chastyse hym selfe? Or to wrythe his heed about as a cy or rynge & to caste vpon hym
lothe and asshes? Or call you thi fasting / & an acceptable day vnto ye lorde? What thynge therfore in ex∣ryor matters or doynges can b pleasaūt vnto god / if fastīg solēly done in sacke clothe & asshes dothe displease him?iii. of Kī∣ges. xxi. Or dyd nat ye Nyny∣ites Achab & other ful many turne the yre of god vnto mercye wt such fastyng?Fastyng whē and whereby it is mendble Fastyng therfore doth nat displease god / but thā finally doth it please him / if puryte of mȳde an∣nexed wt the dedes of charite be ad∣d therto. And therfore it folow∣eth: Dissolue thou ye bandes of ini∣quyte / lowse ye burdens whiche do oppresse or presse downe / let thē go re which are impotent & broken wt labours / & breke all charges / deale thy breed vnto ye hongry / ye nedy & way farynge men brynge into thy house / whan thou shalte se a na∣ed man couer hym / and dispyse hou nat thyne owne flesshe / tha

Of this sentence doth the prophete intreate largelye and with many wordes: The lorde is mercyfull / & therfore is he chefely delyted or pleased with the sacrefye of mer∣cyfull doynge. To this doth Christ exhorte in the gospel sayeng:Matt. v. Be ye parfyte lyke as your father is pa∣fyte. How or in what wyse parfyte?How we shall be {per}yte as our heuē¦ly father. In doynge good to all men with out excepcyon. And therfore is ad∣ded: whiche causeth his sonne to ryse vpon the good and vpon th euyll / and doth sende rayne vpo the iuste & vniuste men. The sa
ryghtwysenes in thynges exteryor and haue sought to be recounted holy & vertuous before men rather than before god. Whose supersticy¦on the lorde dothe often & cōmonly reprehende in ye uangely. But we had nede dilygētly to forsee & take hede whether suche thynges do {per}∣tayne vnto vs or no / whiche al∣thoughe we offre or sacrifyce no beastes / yet haue we ceremonyes & rytes pretēdyng a wōderful shewe of holynes / to which men {per}happes do truste neglectyng & leauynge a parte puryte of mynde. Some do wt great coste anourne churches or ēples / founde aulters / edifye mo∣nasteryes or cloistersChurche buylders and foun¦ders of aulters & cloysters. / & yet do they nat gyue to theyr nedy neyghbour yt they owe to gyue / nother do they restore theyr euyl gotē goodes / nor chaūge theyr corrupt lyuyng / & yet hey reioyse ī thē seues / as though god were greatly beholden to thē
for theyr good doynge / yea suche wyll cause them selues to be payn∣ted and theyr ymages to be grauen in the temples ascrybynge therto theyr names and tytles. But I feare leaste god wyll also saye vn∣to them: Who dyd requyre these thynges of yur handes that you shulde wake in my porches / I Isay. i.meane that ye sude occupye the temple and myne aulters with your tytles nams and ymages? Some do beleue that he hath got∣ten god by the fote / and that he is full godlye or holy if he do gyue money for masses to be songe or celebrate for hym in certayne pla∣ces / and vpon certayne prescrybed days. An other dothe beleue in lyke wyse that he is all so well sped if he do bestowe money that the morowe masse may be solemplye songe in the honour of oure Lady with the quers and the or∣gans
goynge / and that an an∣temne be songe agayne at euen in the worshyppe of her with moost melodyous harmony of syngne men / of the organs and with ieoly¦iynglynge or chymynge of the bel∣les. If these thynges be done with myndes vnpurefyed / or with out mercye associate / is it nat to be doubted leaste they shal heare sayd agayne to them:Isay. i. And whan you shall crye vnto me I wyll nat gra∣cyouslye heare you? What than shall we neglecte and dyspyse exte∣ryor worshyppynge or ceremo∣monyes?Of et∣ror wor¦shppng god. Nay verely but we shall brynge it backe from supersticyon to ryghte holynes and deuocyon / from vnmeasurable excessyue and su{per}luous coste to a chrysten mea∣surablenes. Tha ought we pri∣cypally and aboue all thynges / cause that kynde of sacrefyces to be occupyed / which be to god prin∣cypally
delycyous and pleasaunt. And whiche be those? A mynde through fayth and innocencye im∣maculate / and through charyte all redy to do good to all men.Matthe. xiii. These thynges sayeth the lorde shulde y do / and the other oughte nat to haue be omytted. What thynges than be those whiche we oughte to do accordynge to thys sayenge of this psalme: He that doth these thynges shall neuer be moued? These thynges be they whiche of them selues do commende vs to god / all thoughe the other with∣out our blame be nat with them ioyntely added. As for example. The churche hathe assygned or commaunded fastynge / and thou doste obserue it. But yet doste thou nat refrayne from voluptu∣ousnes / frome wrathe / but thou arte more ready than thou ware
wonte to take vengeauce. Thus is thy fastynge displeasynge god which cryeth agaynst the: Thynke ye this fastynge pleaseth me? or that this is the fastynge whiche I haue chosen? Thou haste lefte vn∣done that thou oughtest do / and thou haste done the thynge whi∣che thou oughtest nat omytte. Thou doste celebrate masse but / thou arte at discencyon with thy neyghboure / knowe thou tha that thy sacrifyce or masse is dys∣pleasaunt to god. Thou cryeste to god mercye / mercye / mercye / but thou doste shewe no mercye to thy brother. Thou prayest that god wolde delyuer ye frome peryll / whan thou denyeste healpe vnto thy brother beyng in peryll. Ther∣fore so many of vs as do professe the name of Chryste and wll be recounted his membres that we

For there wanteth no spotte where as is dyscorde / nouther is there ve∣ryte in the harte where dyuersyte is of opynyons / nouther is in the tonge synceryte where as of doc∣tryne is dyuersyte. More ouer let vs dayly offe sacrefyces pea∣synge to hym / whiche hathe offe∣red hym selfe for vs / that we shulde verelye be a verye preest∣hode. And lette vs also fyghte strongely with the deuyll that we may verely be a royall generacion. Lette vs keape oure selues pure frome all corrupcyon or pollu∣cyons of the flesshe that we maye
Be ye holy for I am holy the lorde your god.euitici. xi. i. Peter.  Aaron him selfe was nat all only consecrate but all his gar∣mētes & al ye instrumētes or vessels of the temple. Nouther was any so presumptuous to applye any suche thynges to any occupyenge in his house / Howe moche more religy∣ously than and reuerently oughte we to be ware leaste we do violent∣ly or vnreuerently take awye any of those thynges (whiche be conse∣rate vnto the seruyce & worshyppe o od) vnto a prophane / vnholye and fylthy vsage.The ves∣ses & gar¦mētes of our tem∣ple. The vessels or implementes of our temple be all our membres / all the powers of our mynde. The garmētes be our dedes or workes by whiche we be anourned to ye glory of god.we be the precyous temple of god. Thou wondreste vpon and doste esteme holy a temple edifyed with whyte marble / glysterynge with golde & precyous stones. But thou arte a
tēple more precious. Thou abydest religyously & deuoutly in a temple which ye bysshop hath consecrate or halowed wt vnccyon or oyle. But y• arte more holy & more consecrate. Thou art nat anoyted wt y• preys∣tes oyle. But what than? Nouther was christ euer anoynted wt Moy∣ses oyle / where as yet he is kyng of kynges / & a preest for euer.The oin∣tement with whi¦che we be halowed Thy crowne & hādes be nat anoynted wt oyle which is made of ye poticaries / but thou arte all whole & through∣ly anoynted wit the blode of he immaculate lambe Iesu Chryste. He is gracyously and blessedly a∣noynted whiche hathe hys harte anoynted with the vnccyon of the holy ghoste. And yet natwithstan∣dynge thou doste nat lacke extery∣or vnccyon. Thou arte anoynted in baptisme / thou arte anoynted in cōfirmacion. In the fyrst thou arte anoynted to be a preest & īto preest∣hode.
And in ye secōde thou arte a∣noynted to warre & to be a warry∣our. In olde tyme men were bapty¦sed wt onely water.In olde tyme mē were bap¦tysed with wa¦ter onely. Psalme. C.iiii. The authoryte of ye fathers dyd adde therto oyle which they call chrisme. Our lorde doth crye by ye {pro}phete: Touche nat ye my christes yt is to saye myne a∣noynted. And Iohn̄ doth say:i. Iohn̄. ii The vnccyon of hȳ shal teache you of al thinges / where he speketh nat only of preestes / but of people which be secrate to christ. Let therfore eue∣ry one of vs se & take hede yt we be∣ynge pure may offe pure sacrefy∣ces / & beyng chaste may offre chaste sacrifices euery mā in his owe tē∣ple. What facrifyces (wyl you say) doste yu meane?Our sa∣crifyces  ate sacrify∣sd. He y• in hȳ selfe hath quēched ye feruent heate or carnall luste of lechery / hath both sacrifised to god a precious gote / & also stry∣stryken Satan oure enemy with a deedly wounde. He that hathe
dryuen out of his mynde the mocy¦ons of enuye hath offered to god a pleasaunte oblacyon. He that hath oppressed feruent and boylyng yre or wrath hath immolate a lyon. He that hath caste awaye foly & igno∣rance hath sacrifysed a shepe. He whiche in trouble and adfliccyons doth submytte hym selfe all whole to the wyll of god hathe offered a sacrefyce passynge acceptable. He that dothe refrayne petulancye or wantones doth offre a calfe.  reiecteth fraude or deceyte takyg to hym simplicyte & playnes dothe sacrefyce a foxe. He whiche dothe correcte or reforme excesse in mea∣tes or drynke with sobernes and tēperance hath offered vp a swyne. He that forgetteth fosysshe pratte∣lynge or clatterynge hath sacrify∣sed a pye. So that in this maner of sacrifyces be all maner of beastes sacrifysed & offered / whether they
haue the fygure or fassyon of any vyce / or els do resemble or repre∣sent any vertue. As he which doth lyue chaste with his laufull wyfe doth offre vp a couple of tyrtle do∣ues to the lord.The ma∣ryed ma is thae which oc¦cupyeth his onely lauull wyfe. He that doth syghe for desyre of lyfe heuenly and doth in all thynges loue simplicyte or playnes / ye same hath oferd vp a payre of pegyons.we ought to offre vp bohe vices sub¦dued and vertues obtained o god / & why. mattheu. v. For we ought to offre vp bothe vyces subdued and also vetues gotten to the lorde / thout whose ayde we can do no∣ the one ne the other. He which so doth leade his lyfe that men se∣ynge his good workes may glory∣fye the father whiche is in heauen / the same doth offre vp moste swete incense. Accordyng to the worde of Paule which is thus:ii. Cor. ii. we be a good auer to god in all places. Pure prayers also and geuynge of than∣kes do make to god a {per}fume more pleasante / than any incense myrhe
and galbanus.salme. ix. There is a sacrifyce of prayse geuynge with which god doth loue to be honoured. There is a sacrifyce of mercye by which we do prouoke the mercy of the lorde. He that for chrystes sake dothe so∣cour  helpe the nedy / or dothe forgyue the trespasser hath offered no vyle but a prcyous oblacyon to the lorde.phe. . olos. . And if accordynge to the admonicyon of the Apostle we do contynually syng with hymnes and songes spirytuall in our haes vnto ye lorde / this melody  xcelle all other instrumentes of musycke. Let vs therfore cōtynu∣ally and alwayes sacrifice vnto the orde with suche sacrifyces / with uche perfumes / with suche obla∣yons / with suche songes / fyght∣nge also by his ayde and suppor∣yon agaynst Satan / that we may e transposed and remoued frome this tabernacle into the tabernacle
