THE PREFACE TO THE READER. READER, it frequently appears by the Histories of all Nations, that Military Glory has not only ta∣ken up the Thoughts, but the Business of the most Illustrious part of Men, in court∣ing which they have not only spared to expose themselves to all the hazards and dangers imaginable, but pressing on even beyond the sense of danger, have perform∣ed, to their immortal Fame, such Heroick Enterprises and Actions as have shaken
the belief of many into the highest degree of Incredulity, especially such as have re∣ceived them upon bare report, naked and unadorned with the many Circumstances that attended them; wherefore I have thought it highly convenient at this jun∣cture to restore, if possible, their belief, by giving them a true Relation of the many famous Battels and Sea-Fights that have been fought under the leading of Empe∣rours, Kings, Princes, and Great Cap∣tains, the most expert of their times in Warlike Discipline, with their various Suc∣cess and Fortune. Nor may it serve less to incite or inflame the Valiant where a Just cause offers an Invitation: Prece∣dents of this Nature always being attend∣ed with powerful Motives to stir up even the Pusilanimous at least to conceive a ge∣nerous esteem of great Atchievements, and kindle in Heroick Minds a restless Flame not to be extinguished but by Death. The∣mistocles that Noble Graecian, whose Fame reaches to the end of Time, having seen the Triumph of Miltiades for a Victory he had obtained, could not (as the story of him
goes) sleep, but became altogether restless till he found Opportunity to enter upon a command wherein he became the Bulwork and Glory of his Country; and it is re∣ported of the Great Julius Caesar, first Emperour of Rome, that whilst he was but in a low Station, seeing the Statue of Alexander the great, and being sensible what vast Kingdoms and Countries that Monarch had subdued and brought under his Subjection in a short spaoe, he wept, be∣cause being equal to him in years, himself had not arrived at his Perfection, and thereupon ceased not till he made almost all the then known World at his Devoti∣on; nor of this kind is he, who was truly stiled the delight of Mankind, and the Honour of our English Nation, the wise and valiant Sir Philip Sidney to be omit∣ted, who reports of himself, That hearing the Ballad of the fight between the Earls Piercy and Dowglass sung but by a com∣mon Chanter, it raised in him such a desire of Martial Enterprises, that he from that time coveted nothing more than to signa∣lize his Valour in the Field, which after∣ward
became to his immortal Fame the wonder of the Christian World. Nor does this Treatise consist only of Battels, &c. but of the Policies, Stratagems, and Pra∣ctices of the most Expert and Renowned Generals and Captains, whereby they se∣cured themselves in a retreat, circumvent∣ed the Enemy, or obtained the Victory; To which a Scheme of Military Behavi∣our is added, &c. with the most material matters and things appertaining to Engen∣ry, especially as to what relates to Gunne∣ry and Artificial Fire works, &c. with somewhat that refers to Fortification; by which even the unlearned may have an insight into that great and curious Art and Mistery, and be made sensible at once of the danger and advantage that attend it; which insight, if it be his fortune to seek for Honour in the Field, &c. may greatly profit the Reader; or if other∣wise, he will at least get this advantage by it, to know in his Retirement what other have sought for not without effusion of Blood, through innumerable hazards and dangers. And so hoping it will prove ad∣vantageous,
not being perverted to a sini∣ster end, I humbly take leave to subscribe my self, Reader, Your devoted Friend and Servant, J. S.
ADVERTISEMENT. REader, be pleased to take notice that the Battel of Alcazar is by an unhappy Mistake placed out of due order, and ought to have follow∣ed the Battel of St. Quintines, after Page Folio 134.
A POEM Recommended to the Reader, upon the Perusal of the Book intitled The Souldiers Companion, &c. By a Person of Quality. IF Fame and Martial Glory you affect, (Reader) what more than's here can you expect; Or if you'd know what in days past was done This Book informs you how much Fame was won; How by their Valour Heroes got Renown, How never-fading Laurels wreath'd their Crown; And rising Monarchs grasp'd a lasting Throne, Or won vast kingdoms to augment their own. How Nations felt a sudden change of State, And Fortune's treacherous smiles perceiv'd too late How Princes set in Blood, how Armies fell, How Plains with might heaps of Ruine swell;
How Rivers with a Crimson Torrent rise, How th' Victors shouts, and how the vanquish'd's crys. Pierce thinner Air, and rend the blushing Skies. How clashing Arms a horrid discord bray, And Earth-born Thunders cloud the Lamp of day, How Iron Globes with Death pave all their way, Whilst angry Vollies bellow'd o're the Plain, And made it seem but one great Field of Flame, Here you may count the number of the slain; Or see the yielding Souldier on his Knee Begging for Life, from's enrag'd Enemy; See others nobly bold, maintain a fight, And in despair to conquer, take delight More in a noble death, than slavish flight. See those in rout cast every way their Arms, Whilst hot pursuit their rear with slaughter storms: Sad sights you'l say, but he who War will court, Must steel his Heart, and think the Danger Sport; Yet safely you may sit and view a Sceen That fatal has to bleeding Nations been: Nor is this all, in it more things you'l find That may more please a weak and tender mind, Though it for Heroes chiefly was design'd. With Magick Flame it treats the God of War, And new created Fires adds to his Star.
THE Souldiers Companion, &c. The Relation of the Great and Memorable Battel fought in Battel Field in Sussex, between Harrold King of England and William Duke of Normandy, on Octob. 14. 1066. KING Harrold having no sooner de∣feated the Army of Norvigians and Danes in the North with exceeding slaughter, (in which, of note fell Harfagar King of Denmark, Tosto his Bro∣ther, and Olave his Son) but News was brought him that the Normans, under the leading of their Duke, were landed in the South; whereupon he made such speed with his Army, that before they could pass through the County of Sussex, he was draw∣ing out of London, and so with the like ce∣lerity marched to give them battel, after having sent back the Messenger who came from the Duke of Normandy to demand pos∣session of the Kingdom, by vertue of a pro∣mise he had made him, when being a pri∣vate man, he was taken Prisoner upon his
Coast; so that both Armies pitching their Tents upon a great Plain, now known by the name of Battel-field, the King sent di∣vers Spies to view the Norman Camp, who being taken and presented to the Duke, he generously feasted them, causing them to be carried from Tent to Tent, and then they were dismissed without any damage or de∣triment. And now Duke William a second time sending to demand the Kingdom, or a single Combat with King Harrold, and both of them being refus'd, as also another proffer, which was to hold the Kingdom as a Feudetary of Normandy; the Armies drew out on the 14th of October 1066 to try the Fortune of a King and Kingdom by more Swords than one, when being set in ar∣ray of Battel, and incouraged on either side with moving Orations, the bloody Blast was sounded, and the Kentish Men, who claimed the Avaunt-guard or From of the Battel as their Right, moved and charged the Enemy in the Front with great fury, the Battalions and Wings of Horse on the other parts doing the like, yet keeping firm in their thick and closed Ranks, so that what with the shot of Ar∣rows and those that came to the Sword and push of Pike, a bloody and doubtful Fight ensued; nor could the Normans with the
continual wheeling of their Horse, and shot of Archers, of which they mostly consisted, dismay or disorder the English Battel, tho in their motions they shot a slaunt in the Air, that the Arrows in their fall might disable the inmost Ranks and gaul the Horse; which the Duke perceiving, and finding that unless he could loosen the Bat∣tel it was in vain for him to expect the Vi∣ctory; (nor had he any hope of return, his Fleet being before fired at his command) he ordered the Retreat to be sounded, but n such a manner, that the whole Army consisting of 50000 Horse and Foot might suddenly face about and charge at the Sig∣nal appointed to be given; which Strata∣gem answered his Expectation, for the English supposing the Normans fled, sudden∣y disranked to pursue them, so that their Orders being open, and the Duke rallying  is Men, broke in with a furious Charge, nd made such slaughter that the ground was covered with heaps of the slain, nor ould the King though he laboured to cast em into a thick Body restore the Battel; ut as he was intent upon it, he received the ot of an Arrow which entred his Brain, nd of which Wound he fell down dead ter which a miserable slaughter ensued, ough a party of the English cast them∣selves
into a Ring and manfully resisted; however, being in the end routed on all parts, there fell 97974 by the Sword and shot of Arrows, amongst which were the King and his two Brothers Leosin and Grith, together with the flower of the English No∣bility, and of the Normans not above 9000, and although their Duke escaped, he had three Horses slain under him, yet by this Battel so gained he won a Kingdom, for the Land being thus deprived of her King and Nobles, no farther resistance was made, but all things were left to the dispo∣sal of the Conqueror, who soon after cau∣sed himself to be Crowned King, and is known in our Cronologies by the style o King William the First, or William the Con∣queror. Thus Normans fierce possess'd our fruitful Soile, And stain'd with blood the famous British Isle. Speed de vitae W. C. The Battels of Jerusalem, or Jerusalem no by the Armies of the Western Princes, De∣cember 25. 1099. JErusalem being in the hands of the Infi∣dels, their unheard of Cruelties louden∣ed the crys of the oppressed Christians, an
obliged them to importune their Patriarch to implore the Christian Princes to send their Armies by Battel to rescue them from their Oppressors, who accordingly send∣ing his Letters full of lamentations, by one Peter a Hermit, with other proofs and at∣testations of the miseries they suffered in the Holy Land, such credit was given to them, that in a short time an Army of 300000 men were raised, wearing on their Breasts red Crosses in token of their holy Warfare, and were chiefly under the lead∣ing of Godfry of Bulloin, Duke of Lorrain, and his two Brothers Eustace and Baldwin, Hugh brother to the French King, Raymond and Robert Earls of Flanders, Robert Duke of Normandy, Son to William the Conqueror, Stephen de Valois Earl of Chartires, Adimer Bishop of Podolia, &c. and with this Ar∣my they passed the Hellespont, covering the shores of Asia, and brought a great Terror upon the Infidels, who gathered what For∣ces they could to oppose the progress of such a War, and were not altogether unsuccess∣ful, for Peter the Hermit advancing before the rest of the Army with 40000 men, rai∣sed in the Territories of the Church, be∣ing furiously charged by the Enemy, lost the greatest part of his Forces, and was ob∣liged to retire with the rest to Civite, a
Town a little before abandoned by the Turks, not daring to depart thence till the arrival of Duke Godfry, when with their united Forces the Christians marched to the City of Nicea, which they besieged, and made themselves Masters of it in fifty days, finding therein great Riches, and many Persons of note; amongst whom were the Turkish King Solyman's Wife and two Chil∣dren: and the King who came to the Re∣lief of it, with the whole power of the les∣ser Asia, consisting of 60000 Horse and Foot, was overthrown, with such slaughter as covered the Fields with the dead Bodies, and filled the Ditches with blood, nothing being to be heard but crys and dying groans, for the Christians following the Execution, 40000 of the Infidels fell by the Sword, which brought such a Terror up∣on those Parts, that Cities and Towns were abandoned without so much as being dis∣puted; Antioch only of all in that large Tract held out, yet made but a weak resi∣stance, for after a furious Assault it was ta∣ken; which being known to the Garrisons of Iconium and Haraclea, they surrendred upon the first summons, still flying before the Victors, and daily sending to his Co∣zen Axan, the Persian Sultan, for Aid; but he not being able to supply him against
such powerful Opponents, the Christians recovered all that had by the Infidels been torn from the Greek Empire, and then in a full Council of the Princes, agreed that an Oath should be administred to each in∣dividual Person, that none should return till Jerusalem was taken, which as well the Officers as Souldiers joyfully embraced, and so the Army passed over the River Orontes, forcing their way with shot of Ar∣rows through the Turks that guarded the further banks, and took the other Antioch in Surrya on the third day of June, An∣no 1098, and repulsed with great slaughter an Army of 100000 Horse and Foot that came to relieve it, killing 20000 of them upon the place, which made Corbanus the Persian Sultans Lieutenant raise his Siege from before Edassa, and haste to oppose the progress of their Arms; but joyning battel, after a furious and obstinate fight, he was overthrown with almost incredible slaugh∣ter of his men; so that the Valleys were filled in a manner with Blood, and the Bodies of 100000 slain, the Christians not losing above 4000 in this Enterprise; and the next day took 5000 Camels richly laden; and thus conquering on, and taking all the Cities in their way, they came to Jerusalem, at the sight of which they raised
such a shout as made the Country resound with joyful Acclamations, when with Hands and Eyes extended towards Hea∣ven, they called upon the Name of Jesus, and many of them in respect to the place where our Blessed Saviour had preached his Gospel, fell on their Knees and kissed the Ground, making fresh Vows never to leave the City till they had wrested it out of the hands of the Infidels; and thereupon, although their strength was much impair'd by sickness, as well as frequent fights and skirmishes, it was resolved in a Council of Princes, not to defer the siege, although they knew the Governour upon the ap∣proach of the Christian Army had increa∣sed his Garrison, and provided necessaries to enable him the better to defend the Ci∣ty, and make a resolute resistance; so that on Christmas day they sat down before it on the North side; for towards the East and West the Quars, broken Rocks, and shat∣ter'd Hills forbad them access, or at least, rendered any approach on those parts ve∣ry difficult and incommodious, the order of the incampment being in this manner. viz. Next to the Wall incamped Godfrey of Bulloin Duke of Lorrain, with his Lorrainers and Germans; next him on the right, Ro∣bert
Duke of Normandy, Son to the Conque∣rour, and the Earl of Flanders pitch'd their Tents: and over against the West Gate were alotted the Stations of Tancred, and the Earl of Tholous, Bohemund and Baldwin being then absent, the one remaining King at Antioch, and the other Governour at Edassa; and so having refreshed themselves, it was concluded among the Princes, that on the fifth day of January the Assault should be given, which was accordingly performed with much bravery and reso∣lution; nor were the Turks, Jews, and Sa∣razens wanting to make an obstinate de∣fence, though as they stood to it upon the Walls and Towers, they were miserably overwhelmed by showers of Arrows, so that some thousands were lost on either side, for the Christians wanting scaling Ladders to ascend, at what time the Ar∣chers caused the besieged to give back, and the Weather being exceeding hot, the Ge∣nerals thought fit at that time to sound the retreat, upon which the Souldiers, who at the utmost hazard were desirous of nothing more than winning the City, unwillingly retired; yet that the besieged might have littlerest, on the tenth day of January an∣other fierce assault was given, which being managed with the Engines of War, made
the Walls tremble, nothing therein be∣ing omitted that Policy or true Valour could afford; yet this as the former, through the excessive heat of the Weather, and want of Water, took not its desired effect; for before the arrival of the Chri∣stians, the Infidels having poisoned all the Wells about the City, or stopped them up, they could not be easily discovered; so that none but that of Siloe, which had worked out the Poison, and was become wholesom, yielded them any relief, and that yielded the Army not half enough, through the defeat of which they suffered great Extre∣mity; yet armed with a Christian Cou∣rage and Patience, they endured it without the least repining; and soon after were re∣cruited by a Fleet of Genoess; who arriving at Joppa, sunk their Gallies for fear of be∣ing taken, and marching over land, arri∣ved safe at the Camp, where, as expert En∣gineers, they became very serviceable, in making Engines for assault, and moving Towers, with flying Bridges covered with raw Hides to prevent their being fired, for from these the Christians upon equal terms fought hand to hand with those that kept the Walls and Bulwarks, these Towers overlooking even their highest Battle∣ments; so that now all things being in a
readiness for a third general assault, whilst the besieged were preparing to fire the Towers, the Wind by a sudden Provi∣dence drove back the Flames with such fury, that many of those that kept the Walls were stifled, and others forced to re∣treat; of which, Godfrey duke of Lorrain taking the advantage, mounted the Engine, and being supported by others, leaped up∣on the Wall, and there fixing his standards, defended it in spite of all the resistance that was made, continuing there fighting with his drawn Sword amongst a shower of Ar∣rows, till such time as his venturous attempt incouraged the rest of the Princes to hasten to his Relief, who pressing on with great fury, a terrible slaughter ensued, the Soul∣diers in their Rage not sparing Man, Wo∣man, or Child, that they found in the first heat of their entrance, which made the most couragious of the Turks, Sarazens, and Jews, after an obstinate fight of two hours, to retire into Solomons Temple; in the en∣trance of which they desperately disputed it till thousands of dead bodies covered the place, and all the Pavements were slipery and overflow'd with Blood: And in this fight were the Christians so eager in rush∣ing on, that those who pressed to get for∣ward, pushed many of their Fellows who
were before them, upon the Enemies Wea∣pons; yet the slaughter increasing, and the Infidels finding the City irreparably lost, gave back, and in an obstinate mood betook themselves to the vaulted Roofs of the Temple, where, with such Weapons as they had, they defended themselves till the fury of the Christians was over, and a Trumpet by the command of the Princes sounded as the signal of giving Quarter, at what time they yielded, and had their Lives spared. Thus was the famous City of Jerusalem retaken by the Christians in thirty days, Anno 1099, after it had been in the hands of the Infidels for the space of 409 years, and so great was the joy conceived by the Christians who inhabited it, and had suf∣fered so many Cruelties under the Turkish Governours, that with tears of Joy they embraced the Souldiers every where sing∣ing Praises for their Deliverance. And now a King being wanting, that good Or∣der might be maintained, the Princes in full Assembly proposed that Honour to Robert Duke of Normandy, but he having notice of his Brothers death declin'd it, as being desirous to return and take possession of his Kingdom of England, though he af∣terward found it prepossessed by his youn∣ger
Brother Henry; nor long was it e're he deprived him of his Dutchy of Normandy, and finally of his life by putting out his Eyes, which many attributed as a Judge∣ment for refusing the profferd Scepter of Jerusalem; but upon this refusal Godfry of Bulloin Duke of Lorrain was unanimously chosen King, yet refused to be crowned with a golden Crown where his Saviour for the Salvation of Mankind had sometimes worn a Crown of Thorns. And although an Army of an 100000 Turks and Sarazens advanced to recover the City, yet the Princes draw∣ing out their strength, gave them Battel with so fearful an overthrow, that all the Hills and Plains for the space of nine miles were covered with the bodies of the slain: and so Jerusalem (with other exceeding large Territories) continued in the Possession of the European Christians, during the Reign of nine Kings, and for the space of an 100 Years, when through their own Dissenti∣ons it was lost to Salladine the Sultan of Aegypt. Thus Fame and Piety drew Arms from far, And made proud Asia reel with heavy War, Whilst Christian Faith's regrafted on the stem Where it first flourish'd (great Jerusalem) Whilst Jacob's Heritage, the Promis'd Land, Do's find her Scepter in a Christian hand.
A Description of the Famous Battel fought near Cressy, between the English under the Lead∣ing of Edward the Black Prince, and the French, under the Leading of Philip their King, &c. KING Edward the third of England, ha∣ving in the right of his Mother laid claim to the Crown of France, and the French opposing to it their Salique Law, by which the Heirs Female are disabled from gover∣ning, he rais'd a powerful Army, to gain by the Sword that Right which was deny'd him by a pretended Law, made to exclude the Daughters of France, &c. taking upon him the Title of King of France, Quartering the Arms of that Kingdom with those of Eng∣land, which have so continued from that day; and landing in the North parts, he wasted the Country with Fire and Sword as far as Turwin, defeating such Forces as came to oppose him, and reduced many Towns to his Obedience, soon after de∣stroying their Fleet of 400 Sail of Ships, and in it 30000 men, (many of them of the prime Nobility;) but still being refused to be invested in the possession of the King∣dom, having refreshed himself in Eng∣land, and settled his Affairs, levied an Ar∣my
of 32500 Horse and Foot, with which he repassed the Seas, and brought such a terror upon the French, that many great Towns were abandoned without resistance, which obliged Philip the French King to raise the whole power of his Country, con∣sisting of 100000 Horse and Foot, the Flower of France, &c. and with them ad∣vanced by hasty marches to give the English battel, or to oblige them to retire; of which King Edward having notice by his Espials, caused his Horsemen to quit their Horses, and marshal'd his Army on foot in three Battalions, the chief of which himself re∣tained as a reserve, mostly composed of men at Arms; and the other two under the leading of the Black Prince, his Son, and di∣vers Nobles, he caused to advance into the Plain; where the French coming on with great Fury, as not expecting but to obtain the Victory, were received in the front by the Avaunt-guard of the Men at Arms, whilst the wings of Archers sent showers of Arrows amongst them, which gauling their squadrons of Horse in the flank, put them into great disorder; at which the French Commanders of the Horse growing impatient, broke through their own foot, and made a strong effort upon the Princes Battel, by continually pressing on with
fresh men, which made the Lords who guarded the Prince, send to the King, en∣treating him to advance with his battel to their Succour, To which he returned an∣swer, That he designed the Glory of the day to his Son, and that whilst he was alive, they must not expect any Succour from him, but fight valiantly to win Honour and Renown; which Answer so animated the English, that they fought more desperate than ever, insomuch that the French Horse being in confusion by the goaring of Pikes, and the shot of Arrows, and the Foot not able to relieve them, the men at Arms brake in with such fury, and in a firm battel piercing their squadrons, that they could find no place of retreat or rally, so that the other Battalion charging in the flank, and the Archers still delivering their Arrows with great Celerity, Victory de∣clared on the part of the English, whilst no∣thing but flight and slaughter ensued on the part of the French, insomuch that in six hours space the field was heaped with the bodies of the slain, and nothing was heard so loud as the Crys of the dying men, whilst happy was he that could escape the Swords of his fierce Pursuers. In this battel were slain the Kings of Na∣var, and Bohemia, two Princes of the blood, seven Earls, and 15000 Barons, Knights,
and men at Arms, with not less than 30000 of-lesser note, besides a great num∣ber taken Prisoners, and many of those of the first rank, which were afterwards put to their ransoms. The battel being entire∣ly won, the King and Prince marched to Calais, and besieged it, when as the Gover∣nour having capitulated for some time, and the attempts to relieve it proving un∣successful, he surrendred it to the King, who placed an English Colony therein; and whilst this War lasted, David King of Scot∣land, taking part with the French, and inva∣ding England in the absence of the King, was defeated near Durham, and himself ta∣ken Prisoner by one Copland, most of his Army being slain, and was after eleven years imprisonment redeemed at 100000 Marks; nor was Prince Edward less victo∣rious in a second battel fought between him and John the French King, Son to the fore∣mention'd Philip, who came against him with 100000 Horse and Foot, or as some will have it 130000, in which battel fought near Potus, there were slain fifty two No∣ble men, most of them Dukes and Earls, 1700 Knights and Esquires, and 16000 common Souldiers; the King himself, to∣gether with Philip the Dauphin, one Arch-Bishop, ten Earls, and about 200 Knights
and Esquires were taken Prisoners, besides a great number of lesser note, though here the French were three to one in the Field. Thus England's Antient Glory rais'd by Arms, The World through Fame's loud breathing Trumpet charms: And this Memorial through all Lands does spread, That no Land has more valiant Hero's bred. A Relation of the fatal Battel fought on the Plains of Cossovia, between Amurath the first, King of the Turks, and the Despot of Servia, in League with divers other Christian Princes, Anno 1390. THE Turkish Kingdom, founded by Otho∣man in Asia, having spread it self in a short time over the Hellespont into Europe, and their Arms brought a Terror upon the Greek Empire, now sick and languishing, by reason of intestine broils; to prevent the further incroachment of Amurath, the Des∣pot, or Prince of Servia, made a private League with the King of Bosna, that with their united Powers they might defend their Territories; which was not yet so se∣cretly done at an interview between them, but the Turk had notice of it; and ha∣ving overthrown Aladin the Caramanian
King in Asia, and stripped him out of his Countries, he drew all his Forces into Eu∣rope, to oppose the Princes, who were raising what Power they could to march against him, and knowing they had to deal with one of a fierce and cruel nature, resolved to try what might be done by stratagem; in order to which, a Captain that kept a Castle on the Confines of Bosna, hasting to the Camp of Amurath, promised him for a large Reward no put the greater part of the strong holds into his hands, if he would follow his directions, confirming him in what he said by many specious Pretences and Protestations, insomuch that the co∣vetous Turk credited him so far as to send 20000 men under the leading of his Tutor Lala-Schahin, which the Captain suffering for a while to plunder some inconsidera∣ble Places, to give them thereby the grea∣ter confidence of their security; in the end he trained them into an Ambush of 30000 Besniacks, who as they were stragling, fell upon them, and cut off 15000 of them, the other 5000 with Schahin hardly escaping to make a relation of their welcom. Amurath being not a little grieved and vexed at the misfortune and disgrace put upon him by one in whom he thought he might have confided, considering the Re∣wards
he had bestowed to ingage him on his part, breathed nothing but Revenge against the Christians, and in the height of his fury commanded his Army to march into Servia, where, somewhat contrary to his Expectation, he found the Christians with a formidable Army ready to bid him battel, when as some inconsiderable Towns being taken and possest on both parts, and the dreadful day of battel drawing nigh, the Armies, as if by consent, met upon the large Plains of Cossovia, where the Generals and Great Captains on either side having made many Speeches and moving Orati∣ons to animate the Souldiers to try their utmost Power and Force, and set them in battel array, the charge was founded, and the battalions joyned with such fury, that the Earth trembled under their Feet, and such was the horrid clashing of Arms, the noise and shouts of the Conquerors, the Groans and Crys of the vanquished, and the neighing and trampling of Horses, that many report the wild Beasts in the Moun∣tains stood trembling at what it might sig∣nifie, or whence so great a Clamour pro∣ceeded, and that such as beheld the fight at a distance, imagined the showers of Arrows that darkned the Plains, descended from the Clouds; and so furiously the Despot to
revenge the mischiefs the Turks had done in his Country, charged upon the right wing, that he broke and disordered it, and pierced the main battel: But the Turks being double the number of the Christians, and Bajazet, Amurath s Son, coming in with twenty thousand Horse, restored the battel, so that the Christians being wearied with slaughtering their Enemies, and having done all that could be expected from true Valour for the space of eight hours, for so long the battel lasted, they were at length overset and put to the worse in all parts, and the Plains were made mountainous with the heaps of the slain, so that they in some measure hindred the pursuit, though the Christians, like men, desperately resolved to conquer or dye, fled not till Lazarus the Despot, and all the great Captains were killed, valiantly fighting, or whilst there was any hopes of Victory, or of an honour∣able Retreat; Those that fell in this bat∣tel on both sides not being accounted less than 50000. But of this Victory Amurath had but small joy, for whilst he was glut∣ting his Eyes with the vast heaps of the slain, a Christian Souldier named Cobelites, half dead and faint with Wounds and loss of Blood, rising as it were from a Golgotha, or Grave, came staggering towards him, fall∣ing
two or three times in twenty paces, whilst those that were about him would have hindred his approach, but Amurath forbad them to hinder him, as supposing he came to petition for Life, when on the contrary, without a word speaking, sudden∣ly drawing out a Dagger, he stabbed him into the Belly, for which he was hewen in pieces by those that attended their King, who likewise died of that wound soon af∣ter; and for this Reason the Turks, when any one is admitted to his Audience of the Emperour, lead him by either Arm, &c. Thus were Cossova's Plains made fat with Blood, And Death was glutted with a Crimson Flood. The tot'ring State of Christendom found there A fatal Scar which still she's forc'd to wear. A Description of the Memorable Battel fought on the Plains of Sennas in Asia, between Tamerlane the Great, Prince of the Tar∣tars, and Bajazet, the First of that Name, King of the Turks, &c. BAjazet succeeding Amurath, who was kill'd on the Plains of Cossovia, not on∣ly prosecuting his Wars against the Chri∣stians, but stripping the Mahometan Princes
out of their Dominions in the lesser Asia, and they hearing of Tamerlane's Conquests in the great Kingdom of China, where he had wrought Wonders, and of his Power with the Tartarian Emperour, whose Daughter he had married, many of them fled to him for Refuge, imploring him by Arms to restore them to their just Rights that had been wrongfully taken from them; which so far prevailed with him, being at the same time sollicited by Emanuel the Greek Emperour, whom Bajazet had be∣sieged in Constantinople, the chief City of his Empire, as to send Ambassadors to the Turk with Presents on their behalf, requi∣ring him to cease from molesting his Allies, and more especially so worthy a Person as the Greek Emperour had been represented to him to be; but instead of answering his Expecta∣tions, Bajazet in a proud manner not only rejected his Presents, but in opprobrious Terms made him many foul Reproaches, telling his Ambassadors, He desired nothing more than to meet him in the Field; and so dis∣miss'd them with Threats and Scorn, which so enraged the Tartar, that being be∣fore perswaded by Axalla his great Favorite, a Genoa by Birth, and by Profession a Chri∣stian (and having an Inclination to assist the Christian Emperour, whose Opinion
he favour'd) to raise an Army, he now re∣solved to do it, and such an Army as should cover the Countries he passed through, which he soon did in those vast Domini∣ons; and taking leave of his Father-in-Law and his Wife, passing the Mountains, marched through divers Countries, draw∣ing a World of People after him, none daring oppose or attempt to hinder his Passage; when at Bachichich he mustered his Forces, and found them to consist of 800000 Horse and Foot of divers Nations, and there he gave them general Pay, not having suffered any of them to do the least Outrage or Injury to the People or their Goods through the Country they had pas∣sed. The News of whose Approach com∣ing to Bajazet as he lay at the Siege of Con∣stantinople, he rise, and with his whole Power passed into Asia, happily as the Tar∣ter wished, who would have been other∣wise much put to it for Conveniency to transport so great an Army, nor had Ba∣jazet failed with a small Fleet to have pre∣vented it. However, whilst Tamerlane was passing the Euphrates, and taking the great City of Sabastia, Bajazet joyned his Lieute∣nant in Asia; so that their united Forces made no less than 500000 effectual men, when meeting with the Governour o
Sabastia, whom Tamerlane had sent to ac∣quaint him with the Subversion of that Ci∣ty; he demanded which was the greater Ar∣my, he having seen both, to which after craving pardon, if speaking according to his Judgment he should offend, That doubtless Tamerlane's must needs be the greatest, seeing he was Lord of far greater Countries; at which Bajazet laughing, said to those that stood by, Out of doubt the sight of the Tartars have made this Coward so afraid, that he believes every one to be two. The Armies by this time being come within sight of each other upon the large Plains of Sennas, it was not thought by either General convenient to joyn Battel that Even∣ing, by reason the Day was far spent, but to stand upon their Guard till the next Morn∣ing, though several Skirmishes passed be∣tween the Turkish Avaunt-guard and the Par∣thean Horsemen, in which a Turkish Officer being taken and carried before Tamerlane, he caused him to be dismissed, with a Com∣mand to tell his Master, That now he was come to meet him in the Field as he had desi∣red, and that he might the better know him, he should find him fighting under the Green Standard. The Morning being come, and either Army standing in Battel-array, the charge was sounded, whereupon the Wings
began to move with great speed, whilst the Prince of Ciracan, Tamerlain's Lieutenant and Kinsman, with 40000 Horse gathered in Parthia and Media, charging the Avaunt-guard with great fury, pierced the main battel, and put the Janizaries into disorder. But the Prince entering too far amongst their Ranks was slain, and his squadron in the end over-borne; whereupon Axalla with his squadron, composed of Sciths and Parthians, with such fury charged the Turks left Wing, that cutting down all that oppo∣sed him, he stopped not till he faced the Bat∣talion of the Janizaries, at what time the foot-men came to joyn him; yet so valiant∣ly did the Janizaries stand to their Arms, in the middle of whom was the Person of their King, that the fight continued bloody and doubtful for the space of an hour or more, all the place being paved with dead Men and Horses; till the Tartars over∣charged, gave ground, which Tamerlain per∣ceiving, sent 10000 Horse to reinforce them and other 10000 to fight in the Rear ward whilst his foot-men fell on with the Turk main battel that was as yet unshaken; and forcing their way, opened a Passage to the Rear-ward of the Janizaries, who sustaine their charge for a considerable time; bu being in the end over-power'd by number
they were obliged to give ground; when Tamerlain coming on with a Reserve of 50000 fresh Horse, and charging through the Horsemen that covered the main battel of the Turks, and the Foot-men already wearied and tired out, making but weak resistance, many of their prime Comman∣ders being slain, they were on all sides mise∣rably beaten down by the Horsemen; who with their Maces, Poll-axes and Scimiters, entering their Ranks, made great slaughter; so that losing Courage and Power to resist, they betook themselves to flight: and amongst them Bajazet wounded in his en∣deavouring to restore the battel, who, to∣gether with his Son Musa, fell into the hands of Axalla, as also did the Despot of Servia, who were presented to Tamerlain. Nor is it held by many, thar had not the Subjects of the Mahometan princes press'd to the War n divers parts of Asia the less, perceived heir natural Lords under the Tartars Ban∣er, and in the heat of the fight gone over o them, the Victory had gone with the Turks. However, in this fight, which lasted om seven in the Morning till four in the Evening, 80000 Tartars, and 120000 Turks re computed to be slain; and amongst the ormer, of note only the Prince of Ciracan, who was slain at the beginning of the fight;
and amongst the latter, Mustapha, Bajazets eldest Son, with divers Bassa's, and the Ag of the Janizaries. And it is further con∣firmed, that when Bajazet (being a Prisoner was brought before Tamerlane, that he aske him the reason that moved him to War again so noble a Prince as the Greek Emperour, with∣out any cause given, to which he replyed Even the same Cause that moved you to inva me, viz. The desire of Glory and Sovereigm And why, said the Tartar Prince, do you  such Tyranny over those you Conquer, with respect of Sex or Age: That did I, said h to give the greater Terror to my Enemies. A Ah, continued Tamerlane, What would y have done with me if it had been your Fort to have had me in your Power? I would sa Bajazet, boldly replying, as not conque though overcome, Have put you in an I Cage, and as a Trophy of my victory, h carried you throughout my Dominions. Th said Tamerlane, It is but just that I serve  in the like kind; and thereupon comma∣ing him out of his Presence, a cage by  Order was made for him, in which he con∣tinued till in a desperate Mood he beat  Brains out against the Bars of it. And  though Tamerlain pursuing this Victor won all that which the Turks held in  rope, and most of that in Asia; yet he dy
Mahomet, Bajazets Son, recovered it in few years by Policy and Force. Thus we behold how fickle Fortunes Wheel Plays Tricks with mighty Ones, and lets them feel. How soon from th' top of Empire she can thrust Monarchs, and lay their Glory in the Dust. A Description of the Battel of Azin-Court, sought in France between Henry the Fifth, King of England, &c. and the Dolphin of France, &c. on the Plains near Azin-Court, &c. KING Henry the Fifth coming to the Crown after the Death of Henry the Fourth, his Father, and being of a Martial Spirit, began to consider how by some great Exploit he might leave a Name; and there∣upon considering that Normandy, Guien, Aqui∣tain, and Anjou, were the rightful Inheri∣tances of the Kings of England, and had without any just Cause been wrested from his Predecessors during the Intestine Troubles of this Kingdom, he sent Ambassadors to Charles the French King, to demand them, but not only being denied it, but some Affronts put upon him, he sent Antelop his Pursuvant at Arms, with Letters of defiance;
and having discovered and escaped a Con∣spiracy against his Life, laid by the Contri∣vance of the French, who had promised se∣veral of his Nobles a Million of Gold to ef∣fect his Death, he embarked with his Army for France, and landed at Harflew in Nor∣mandy, where he had Burdeaux, and many Towns of Note put into his Hands, in which he left Garrisons, and placed in them English Artizens with small Resistance, which made him resolve to pass through the Countries of Caux and Ewe, to his Town of Calais, though his Army consisted of no more than 13000 Foot, and 2000 Horse, and so set forward with easie Marches, the Country in his way being all destroyed be∣fore him; for the French having notice of what he intended, had not only removed the Forrage and Provisions, but destroyed and brake down the Bridges, fell'd Trees, and plashed Woods in the way he was to take, raising in the mean time great Forces in all parts of the Country, as not doubting but they had him and his Army at their Pleasure; and indeed for want of Necessa∣ries, and by reason of the Difficulties the Sol∣diers were forced to struggle with, many o them in a short time became sick and in∣firm; so that the King finding himself in a strait, began to repent him that he had so
far advanced into the Enemies Country, as knowing should he now retreat, he must fight his way; wherefore he made some Overtures to the French Generals, proposing to surrender several Towns he had taken in Normandy, but they rejected these Propositi∣ons with Derision, as not doubting but him∣self and them together, with his small Ar∣my, wherein were many of the English No∣bility, would be at their disposal; and so confident were they herein, that the three Generals, viz. The Dolphin, the Dukes of Burgundia and Orleans had conditioned and agreed amongst themselves for the Prisoners and Spoils, and with their huge Army, con∣sisting of 150000. Horse, and 10000 Foot, (many of the former being the Nobility and Gentry of the Kingdom, who hoped to win Honour in such, as they thought it, an assured Enterprize;) they advanced apace; so that King Henry, a Man of an undaunted Courage, seeing no way but to fight, dispo∣sed his Army to the best Advantage, placing in the front a competent number of Archers, who carried beside their Bows and Swords, long Stakes pointed with Iron, to fix in the Ground slauntwise, that when they retired, they might secure them against the Horse. And in a Meddow with a convenient Ditch to defend it, he placed as in an Amubush,
five hundred Archers, who lay within half shot of the French Wing, whilst in the main Battel stood the men at Arms, and the Horse divided into two Squadrons, were to charge as advantage gave them Opportunity. And now whilst the French, who covered the Country, were advancing in three main Battels as to assured Victory, the King with a moving Oration exhorted his Captains and Souldiers, For the Honour of their Country, and their own safety, not to faint, but stand to it manfully; and confiding in the justness of their Cause, not to despair of Victory: nor should for his part, let France see him a Captive, or Eng∣land be put to the Charge of his Ransom, as being resolved to dye with Honour, if things came to Extremity. And so the Charge being sounded, the thick squadrons of the French, who scarcely had room for an orderly march, came furiously on, and were when within shot met by a flight of English Ar∣rows, which gauling their Horses, and dis∣mounting divers of their Chiefs, command was given to press on, and come to a close fight, thereby to frustrate the Archers of the use of their Bows; at what time a furious charge being given, the Archers retreated a few Paces, and left bare a triple tire of pointed Stakes, which till that time they had covered; upon which the French Horse-men
rushing, a great number of their Horses were gored, and sticking as it were, altoge∣ther disabled, barrocaded the English Army from the approach of the rest; so that not only the Archers in the front continued to pour in their shot, but likewise those in the Meadow that flanked the squadron of the Right Wing, began incessantly to deliver their shafts, which in a short time wrought such Confusion, that the French finding no place to retire amongst the thick Ranks that still pressed on, and wedged as it were each other in, began to fall into disorder, many of them disranking, as not being able to manage their wounded Horses, nor could their Foot conveniently advance to their re∣lief; so that the men of Arms breaking in with great fury, and the English Horse char∣ging their Right Wing, a miserable slaughter ensued, nothing but death and flight being seen on their part throughout the field, whilst the King himself, distinguished by a Crown he wore on his Helmet, fought courageously, piercing their main Battel, forcing his Horse over heaps of the slain; which the Duke of Alanso, who commanded on that part, per∣ceiving, broke through the formost rank in a desperate manner, and charged with his Sword so forcibly, that with the blow he bruised the Kings Crown, and made him a
little recoil, but the King soon advancing, gave him such a stroke as beat him to the Ground, at which time he cryed out he was Alanso, and begged for quarter, notwith∣standing which, and though the King la∣boured to save him, he was there slain; and now the French began to retire in great dis∣order, nor was it in the power of the Com∣manders to restore the battel; which ad∣vantage the English perceiving, had the Ex∣ecution of them with such a fearful slaughter, that it is reported by divers Historians, and some of them their own, that no less that 4000 Noble-Men, Knights, and Esquire were slain, together with 100000 of the meaner sort, though all agree the French lost 60000 in that defeat, and so many Pri∣soners, many of them of the first Rank, were taken; that the King fearing (upon fres Troops showing themselves upon the Hills which were indeed come too late to the bat∣tel, as not hearing of the overthrow) tha being more in number than his own men if the French reinforced should rally an come to another tryal, they might fall upon his Rear in the battel, caused them all ex∣cept some of the Chief, to be slain th which, although it was a bloody Sentenc yet Self-preservation at that time made it? State Policy. And soon after this Victory
which he ascribed to God alone, the King had not only Paris put into his Hands, but Marrying Catharine, Daughter to Charles the French King, he was Crowned King of France in Reversion, and possessed himself of all the Cities and Towns of that King∣dom, except a few the Dolphin held out against him in Berry. Nor did this Glorious Victory cost the English much Blood, there being not above 2500 slain; and of Note only Edward Duke of York, and the Earl of Worcester. Thus Haughty France drunk with her Blood did reel, And fell before a Conquering Monarchs Steel. Thus in old Days kind Heav'n for England fought, And Mighty Realms to her Subjection brought. A Description of the Glorious Battel and chievements of the Mighty Scanderbeg, King of Epirus, being an Account of his many Victories over the Turks, under the leading of Amurath, the Second King of that Name, &c. AMurath, the Second Turkish King of that Name, by the many Conquests he had made, growing dreadful to the lesser Princes, divers of them conditioned to be∣come his Tributaries; and amongst others,
John Castriot, Prince of Epirus, for the due Observance of which he gave his four Sons as Hostages, viz. George, (after named by the Turks, Scanderbeg) Stamsius, Reposius, and Constantine, Amurath promising well and honourably to intreat them; yet he had no sooner gotten them into his Possession, but he caused them to be circumcised, and to be instructed in the Mahometan Supersti∣tion, poisoning, upon a Jealosie of their in∣tending to escape, all but the first; and af∣ter the Fathers Death seized, contrary to his Promise, upon the Kingdom of Epirus; which not a little grieving George Castriot, or Scanderbeg, whose Right it was, he sought  ways to escape; but the crafty Turk  watchful Eye over him, intending at  times to put him to death, but by  eans or other was as often prevented:  being at length made a Comman∣der in the Turkish Army against the Hunga∣rians, and that Army with a fearful slaugh∣ter overthrown by the Great Huniades on the Plains of Moravia, he then thought it the best time to escape and fly the Turkish Servitude; whereupon taking with him Amurath's Secretary, with divers of his trusty Friends, he led him into a large Wood, and there compelled him to write in his Masters Name to the Governour of Croija,
the chief City of Epirus, as also to sign it with his Signet, to the intent that he might deliver him up his Charge, which accord∣ingly he did; and then having secured him from making any Relation thereof, he post∣ed thither, and had it upon the sight of those Letters surrendred; at what time sending for Prince Amasa his Kinsman, Moses, an expert Captain, and divers others, he ac∣quainted them with the purpose he had to deliver his Country from the Turkish Tyran∣ny; who approving his undertaking, his Subjects frequently resorted to him, so that he became very powerful, and divers Cities revolting from the Turks, put themselves under his Protection, as Stelusia, Petra, Al∣ba Petrolla, so that with a great Power he entred Macedonia, and laid those Countries that were under the Turkish Sovereignty waste; at which unexpected News Amu∣rath being greatly alarmed, sent 40000 of his best Souldiers under the leading of Alis Bassa to surprize him; but Scanderbeg retiring in∣to Epirus, gave him battel with no more than 6000 Men, and after a sharp dispute overthrew him with the slaughter of 22000 of his Men, not losing above 300 of his own, carrying in a manner the battel with his Prowess; for charging the Turkish squa∣drons, he broke through, beating down all
with an irresistible force that stood before him; so that his men following him had little to do but to slaughter the routed and amazed Turks. After which Amurath sent Mustapha Bassa with a great Army to waste Epirus, who was by Scanderbeg overthrown, and himself taken Prisoner. These overthrows so enraged Amurath, that raising a mighty Power, he came in Person, promising great Rewards to those that could bring Scanderbeg's Head, and so besieged Sfetigrade; but although he bat∣ter'd it incessantly with his Cannon, and made frequent Assaults with the loss of 20000 of his best men, it was so resolutely defended by the Governour, who would not be corrupted by any offers of Gold, that he despaired with his huge Army to win it; and fearing by the Sallies of the besieged, and the frequent Assaults Scanderbeg made with his flying Army, by breaking into one quarter or other of his Camp, that his mul∣titude being consumed, he should be obliged to return with disgrace; he in the end in∣dented (for a Sum of Money in hand, and a larger quantity when it should be effected) with an inconsiderable Fellow, by Occupa∣tion a Smith, to cause the City to be surren∣dered, which he brought to pass in the fol∣lowing manner.
The City of Sfetigrade, by most held im∣pregnable, being scituate upon a Rock, and for that Reason affording but one Well or main Spring, which in abundance furnished the Citizens and Souldiers; into this Well in the Night-time the Traitor cast the stin∣king putrefied Carcass of a Dog that had lain a long time in the Streets, which being found and drawn thence the next Morning, as likewise noised throughout the City, as well the Citizens as Souldiers refused any more to drink of it; nor could the Gover∣nour with all his Perswasions and Intreaties oblige them to it, though himself, to con∣vince them of the wholsomness of the Wa∣ter, drank often in their sight; but they ra∣ther chose to undergo the worst Extremities of Thirst, by which means many of them died; so that the Governour through this Nicety of his Souldiers not finding the City tenable, was obliged to capitulate; and marching out with Bag and Baggage, was conducted to Scanderbegs Army: and he by whose Treachery the City fell into the Hands of the Turks, being for a while seem∣ingly carress'd, was in the end secretly made away: yet upon Amurath's return Scander∣beg fell upon the Rear of his Army, and cut off 3000 of his Men.
The year following Amurath returned with a greater Army and besieged Croija, the chief City of Epirus; but losing under its Walls without success 30000 men, and despairing notwithstanding to win it, he died in his Tent Anno 1450. leaving his Son Mahomet to succeed him in his Empire, charging him to be revenged of Scanderbeg, with whom his Armies under the leading of divers Bassa's fought many bloody Bat∣tels, but were always worsted by the invin∣cible Prince, even with a handful of men, his Force and Courage being such, that he often with his own hand turned the Scale of Victory when it was inclining to his Ene∣mies; nor could the Corruption of his great Captains with vast Sums of Turkish Gold al∣ter his Fortune: so that having stood twen∣ty four years the Champion and Bulwork of Christendom, he at last died in Peace at Lyssa; which Town nine years after his Death being taken by the Turks, they open∣ed his Sepulchre, and took thence his bones, for which they had such a Veneration, that happy was he that could get the smallest piece of them; which being got, they count∣ed of great Value, and wore it about them as an inestimable Jewel, fancying that ever after Scanderbeg's Fortune would attend them.
Thus di'd the Hero far Renown'd in Arms, Whose very Name the Globe with Wonder charms. No Pow'r from him could take the Laureat Prize, Till All-subduing Death seal'd up his Eye, And lay'd him up till he more Glorious Rise. Englands Pharsalia, or the bloody Civil War between King Henry the Sixth, of the House of Lancaster, Richard Duke of York, and Edward the Fourth, of the House of York; describing the several Fights and pitch'd Battels wherein 100000 Men on both sides are ac∣counted to be slain, &c. RIchard Duke of York taking distaste at the Release of the Duke of Somerset by King Henry the Sixth, he with the Earl of Warwick, and divers others his Accompli∣ces, fell to open Force, and levied an Army about the Marches of Wales, with which they marched towards London, under pre∣tence of redressing Grievances, and removing evil Counsellors; to oppose whom King Hen∣ry drew out, and both Armies meeting at St. Albans, in the County of Hertford, the Duke sent to the King to demand divers Lords that were about him, and such as he should name or prescribe; but being rejected with disdain, the charge was sounded, and
both Armies joyned Battel furiously, and maintained a doubtful fight, till at length Victory began to declare for the King; but the Scale was soon turned, for Warwick breaking through the Gardens with about 2000 men, and his approach not being there suspected, the Kings Army, (many of the chief Nobility being slain) was broken, yet would he not fly, but stood the shot of the Archers till wounded in the Neck, he was taken Prisoner; and being carried to London, and a Reconciliation made on both parts, the Duke being shortly constituted Gover∣nour of Ireland. In this fatal Batal of St. Al∣bans between the Houses of York and Lanca∣ster, fell forty eight Noble-men, Knights, and Esquires, and amongst them the Earls of Somerset, Northumberland, and Stafford, together with 5000 of the meaner sort, and many were wounded, amongst whom was the King. Long did not the seeming Reconciliation last, but the Duke of York raising new Trou∣bles, was, together with the Earls of March, Rutland, Warwick, and Salisbury, with others of less Note, attainted of High Treason in Parliament, but it so little discouraged them, that drawing out from the several places where they were retired with their Army, consisting of 25000 men, they took
the Field, against whom the Kings Army advanced with great speed, so that meeting at Northampton, a cruel and bloody fight ensued, but in the end, the King being un∣fortunate in War, his Army was worsted, and himself a second time made Prisoner, there being on both sides not less than ten thousand men slain, and of Note Humphry Duke of Buckingham, the Earl of Shrewsbu∣ry, and the Lord Egremont; and a Parlia∣ment being called, the Duke laid claim to the Crown, deriving his Pedigree from Leo∣nel the Third Son of Edward the Third, elder Brother to John of Gaunt, the Father of Henry the Fourth, Grandfather to the King: so that after a great debate, at length it was concluded on all parts, that King Henry du∣ring his natural Life should quietly possess and enjoy the Crowns and Kingdoms, and afterwards they to remain in general Tail to the Duke of York and his Heirs. But the Queen, a Woman of a Masculine Spirit, not approving that her Son Prince Edward, a Youth of great hope, should be so excluded, withdrew her self into the North, and there, without the consent of the King, raised For∣ces to secure his Right, against whom the Duke advanced with an Army, but unad∣visedly giving her Battel near Sands Castle before his whole Forces were come up, and
falling into several Ambushes laid for the purpose, he himself after a bloody and doubtful fight being slain, together with the Earl of Rutland, his Son, and the Earl of Sa∣lisbury, with three thousand more of lesser Note; and his Head being cut off was crowned with a Paper Crown, and in de∣rision carried through the Queens Victorious Army. The Duke slain, many hoped that this Calamitous War would have an end, but failed in their Expectations, for Edward Earl of March having raised an Army of 23000 men in the Marches of Wales, and hearing of his Fathers Death, advanced with great speed, overthrowing in a great Battel the Earls of Pembrook and Ormond, who endea∣voured near Ludlow to oppose his passage, in which Battel were slain 3800 men, and several Prisoners of Note taken, and amongst them Owen Tuder, Father-in-Law to the King, whose Head by the Command of the Earl was cut off; and so he continued his March to fight the Army that yet remained with the Queen, who was advanced as far as St. Albans, and had overthrown the Lon∣doners who came to oppose her, entering their City with the slaughter of 2000 of them, and took the King, whom they had brought along with them to countenance
their undertaking. But Edward Earl of March approaching her with his Army, which was much increased by the way, she thought it not convenient to give battel, but suffering him to enter London, retired into Scotland. Whilst he taking upon him the Title of King, was Crowned at Westminster, but was not setled in his Throne, before News was brought that King Henry with divers Lords were in the North with a great Army; whereupon he drew out his Forces to give them battel, marching directly to Pomfract in York-shire, sending the Lord Fitz-Walter before to take the Charge of the Pas∣sage of Ferry Bridge, where that Lord, with many others were slain, and King Henry's Forces gaining the Pass, the Armies came in sight of each other, and drew up in Bat∣talia, being the greatest that had been seen in England since the Conquest, Edwards con∣sisting of 48660, and Henry's of 60000 fighting Men, when after some pause the Trumpets sounded the Charge, and the Army moved furiously, when Warwick, who lead the Vaunt-guard, to incourage his men, put from his Horse, by whose Example ma∣ny did the like, resolving to win the Field, or dye in the Battel; so that after It had continued with great slaughter for the space of ten hours, and most of theCommanders
on King Henry's part slain, his Battel swer∣ved, nor could the Courage and Skill of those that survived restore it, but a fearful flight ensued, while the Victors following the Execution, covered all the Field with dead Bodies, whilst the Blood streamed in Channels; for in this Battel fought between the Towns of Towton and Saxton on the twenty ninth of March, fell Persons of Qua∣lity to the number of 375, amongst which were Henry Piercy, Earl of Northumberland, and John Lord Nevel, Brother to the Earl of Warwick, John Lord Clifford, and John Lord Wells, and of the meaner sort 35091, whereupon King Henry with his Son and Queen fled into Scotland, and Edward re∣turned to London. This fatal blow, though it put a damp to their Spirits, did not altogether discou∣rage the Lancastrians, for Queen Margaret going into France, raised new Supplies in that Kingdom, but making towards England, her Fleet was scattered by a Tempest, and she driven upon the Coast of Scotland with the smaller part of it; yet finding her Hus∣band in the Scotish Court highly entertained by James their King, she took heart, and soon after the Scots entered England as far as Durham, when King Edward preparing to meet them, marched to York, and there ma∣king
a halt, sent the Lord Montacute to op∣pose and hinder their further Progress; but being encountered on Hedgly Moor by the Lords Hungerford and Ross, together with Sir Ralph Peircey, he after a sharp dispute took Sir Ralph Prisoner, which success in∣couraged him to pass on and give battel to King Henry, who lay encamped at Hexam, where both Armies striving to do their ut∣most devoir, a bloody conflict ensued, but many being slain, and much blood spilt, di∣vers of the Commanders wounded and disabled, and taken Prisoners, Victory de∣clared against King Henry, who finding himself unfortunate in War, fled into Scotland; in this battel 5600 were slain, and the Duke of Somerset with three other Lords, and one Knight taken Prisoners, who were all beheaded. And now King Henry return∣ing privately into England in disguise, was taken Prisoner, and carried to the Tower, so that Edward seem'd established in his Throne: yet Fate not satisfied with English Blood, though the wounded Nation had bled such Streams as made her faint and languish, another cruel War arose, and the Factions began again to bandy as fierce as ever, for Warwick, who was called after∣wards the make King of those Times, being sent to solicite a Marriage between King
Edward and the Lady Bona, Daughter to Lewis Duke of Savoy, and having finished his Negotiation to the liking of the Lady and her Father, found upon his return tha the King was married to Elizabeth the Wid∣dow of Sir John Gray, slain in upholding the Cause of King Henry, at which the Eat (supposing his Honour that had been in∣gaged in the Savoiards Court greatly to suf∣fer) grew much inraged, and finding mean to withdraw himself, joyned with diver Nobles, raised a Power, and proclaime King Henry, declaring for him, and e∣pousing his Interest, growing on a sudde so strong, that King Edward was forced t draw out his Army and march against him pitching his Camp at Wolney, four Mil from the Plain on which Warwick was en∣camped; but his Guards being negligent and the Earl having notice thereof, entere the Kings Camp and took him Prisoner, ye used him very courteously, allowing him for his Keeper his Brother George Nevil Arch-Bishop of York, who suffering him t ride abroad a hunting, and to follow othe Recreations, till one day being with a slen∣der Guard far from the Castle, and meeting a great Troop of his own Men, those tha were with him durst not speak to him  returning to his Confinement, but were gla
to leave him behind them, and escape for their Lives; so that being again at Liber∣ty, he was received by his Army with great Joy, and passed to London to the great discontent and dislike of the Earl of Warwick. Things being at this pass, Sir Robert Wells, Son to the Lord Wells, raised an Army of 30000, consisting mostly of the Commons of Lincolnshire, on the behalf of King Henry, in revenge of which, King Edward caused the Lord Wells, and Sir Thomas Dimmock his Kinsman, to be beheaded; and so marched to fight Sir Ro∣bert, when charging furiously upon the un∣experienced Plebeans, they scarcely sustain∣ed the second shock, but throwing away their Coats and Weapons, fled for their Lives, from whence it was called the Bat∣tel of Loose-Coat-Field; and the Execution eing hotly pursued by the inraged Soul∣iers, 10000 of them are accounted to be ain. As for Sir Robert Wells and Sir Tho∣mas Deland, who commanded under him, hey were taken Prisoners. Upon the News of this Defeat the Earl of Warwick, and the Duke of Clarence, Brother to King Edward, ed to Callais, but being denied entrance, hey departed thence to the Court of France, where they found Queen Mar∣garet;
where gathering great Forces, they returned to England, every where pro∣claiming King Henry; so that the People from all parts hasted to their Standart, as well the Nobles as the Commons, viz. the Earl of Pembrook, the Lord Faulconberg, and others; so that marching towards London, and King Edward finding his Mandates in many places disobey'd, thought it not con∣venient in that juncture to attend the Sequel, but with divers of his trusty Friends le England, and fled to his Brother-in-Law the Duke of Burgundy, who had a little before married his Sister; so that King Henry wa Re-in-throned, but continued not long i that Estate before King Edward returned landing in the North with a small Army proclaiming King Henry as he passed, and pretending he came only as a private ma to possess himself of his Inheritance, b which means deceiving the People, h surprized the City of York, and having garrisoned it, pulled off the Vizor, and marched towards London, reconciling him∣self by the way thro' the means of a Mai (who had been brought up by the old Dutch∣es of York) to his Brother the Duke of Cl∣rence; whereupon the Citizens opening their Gates, and every where proclaiming him King, Henry was again taken Prisoner an
send to the Tower; and now the whole weight of the War lying upon Warwicks shoulders, he desperately resolved to carry the day, or fighting courageously dye in the Bed of Honour; and thereupon di∣rected his March towards London, out of which King Edward drew his Forces to meet him, and on Easter Day joyned Battel near Barnet, since known by the Battel of Barnet-field, where either of the Generals, impatient of so tedious a War, drew on their Forces with great force and fury, Warwick charging upon the Kings Squa∣dron broke in with his Sword, and made such Distruction, that they fled on that part; and the Battel had gone on his side, had there not been a mistake in part of his Men, who by mistaking their Cogni∣zances, charged upon their fellows, which making them suspect some Treason or sudden Revolt, they threw down their Weapons and fled; which Warwick per∣ceiving, and not finding it in his power to retain them, or restore the Battel, (though he laboured by Example and Perswasion to do it, resolving not to out-live the day) he rushed furiously amongst the Squadrons of the Enemy, and there fighting valiant∣ly, fell upon the heaps of the slain; and with him died his Brother the Lord Mon∣tacute,
and three other Lords were slain on the part of King Edward, and of the mean∣er sort on both sides 20000. The News of this defeat made known to Queen Marga∣ret and Prince Edward her Son, (by such as fled the field) she took Sanctuary in the Abby of Ceerne, but the Lords that escaped the Battel of Barnet, rallying their scatter∣ed Forces, gave King Edward another Bat∣tel at Tewxbury, in which they were over∣thrown with the loss of 3000 men, and of Note the Earl of Devonshire, and the Duke of Somerset's Brother: there likewise Prince Edward was taken, and soon after stabbed by Crook-back'd Richard, Duke of Glocester, in the Presence of King Edward, and soon after King Henry was murthered, and his Queen taken from Sanctuary, and put to a great Ransom. Thus stop'd the Stream of Blood when drain'd near dry, Thus our Pharsalia, England's Tragedy Was Acted in a bloody Scene, till Death With slaughter tir'd, was almost out of breath. What Lands, what Kingdoms might our men have ane With that Bloods loss which Civil hands have drawn. Such Pow'rs united as our Fields distain'd, By Conquering on vast Empires might have gain'd: Have overset bold Ott'mans Rising Throne, And seen his Conquests far beneath their own.
A Description of the Battel of Bosworth-field, fought between Richard the Third King of England, and Henry Earl of Richmond, known afterward by the Title of King Henry the Seventh, &c. AFter the Death of Edward the Fourth, Richard Plantagenet, Duke of Gloce∣ster having caused his two Nephews to be murthered, usurped the Throne, endea∣vouring to establish himself therein, as he had first acquired it, viz. by blood; so that greatly oppressing his Subjects, and especi∣ally the Nobility, as also causing Queen Ann his Wife secretly to be made away, that he might marry Elizabeth his Neece, Daughter to his Brother King Edward the Fourth; divers conspired against him, and amongst the rest the Duke of Buckingham, who had been the main Instrument in helping him into the Throne, but raising Forces, and being unsuccessful in his at∣tempt, his men flying and leaving him to shift for himself, he resorted to the House of one Banister, who had been his Steward, and had got a good Estate under him, where for a time he secured himself in dis∣guise to attend his better fortune, though it proved otherwise, for King Richard set∣ing
1000 l. upon his head, the same Bani∣ster in whom he confided discovered him to the Sherif of the County, who seizing upon him in the Disguise or Habit of a Gardiner, carried him to Salisbury, where (by the Command of the King) without Arraignment or Tryal, he was beheaded. And now by a secret Contract the Earl of Richmond being betroth'd to the Lady Eli∣zabeth, Eldest Daughter to Edward the Fourth, after having escaped many Dan∣gers beyond the Scas, and his Faction being strong in England, prepares, with such an Army as he could well gather by the fa∣vour of the Duke of Brittany, and increased by such English as fled to him for fear of the Usurper, for England, and landed at Mil∣ford-Haven, his Retinue not exceeding 2000, but was soon increased to a far greater number by those that daily came to joyn him, which made King Richard ad∣vance with his Army to oppose him, and pitched his Tents at Radmore near Bosworth in Leicestershire; and both Armies being drawn up in Battalia, the Lord Stanly with a great Detachment kept aloof on the Hills, and the King suspecting he intend∣ed to revolt from him to his Enemy, sent to him to advance, but he refused, saying, he would do it when he saw his time,
whereupon King Richard in a great Rage commanded his Son, whom he had in Ho∣stage for the Fathers Fidelity, instantly to be beheaded, but was by some of his Favo∣rites perswaded to defer it till the Battel was over, by which means the young man escaped, for both Armies joyning with great fury, a bloody and doubtful fight en∣sued; so that for a long time the Scale of Victory hung in an equal poise, King Richard commanding and fighting coura∣geously in all parts: but the Lord Stanly when both Armies had tried their Strengths, and were weary with fighting, coming in with his fresh men, bore down all before him; so that King Richard per∣ceiving the Fortune of the War to go against him, like a man in despair, resol∣ving not to survive it, charged with great fury amongst the thickest Squadrons, and having killed and beaten down many, was at length over-pow'red, and himself slain, falling upon heaps of his Enemies; his Crown was afterward found in a Hawthorn∣bush, and himself stripped naked, was carried all bloody upon a Horse to Lei∣cester, and there buried in the Grey-Friars with much Solemnity, after its being ex∣posed two days to the People. In this Bat∣tel, called the Battel of Bosworth-field, 6000
men on either side were slain, and amongst them divers of Note. And now the Earl of Richmond being Crowned in the Field, marched to London, and soon after solemn∣ly married the Lady Elizabeth, joyning the Houses of Lancaster and York; he being the Heir of the one, and she the Heiress of the other. And so the Discord to soft Concord yields, That with the Bones o' th' slain made white the Fields; Dividing Friends in an unfriendly Jar, Rending the tor'ring State with Impious War, Whilst Father against Son, Brothers with Brothers fight, Not caring who was wrong or who was right, But smeer'd with Blood in Cruelty delight: Being emulous who most cou'd vent his Rage, Such is the fate when Civil Arms ingage. A description of the Battel of Seminara, fought in the Kingdom of Naples, between King Ferdinand, then intituled to that Kingdom, and the Great Gonsalves Catain of the Spa∣niards on the one part, and the Lords Ob∣ignny and Persive, for Charles the French King on the other part, Anno 1495. CHarles the French King, victorious in Italy, having won many strong Places and Countries, and amongst the rest, the Rich and Fertile Kingdom of Naples; Ferdi∣nand,
in whose right it was, raising an Army of Spaniards, Sicilians, Italians, &c. and entred the Provinces the French had a little before brought to their Subjection, in order to re∣cover them, advancing as far as the Coun∣try of Seminara, to oppose whom the Lord Obignny Governour of Calabria for the French King, and the Lord Persive Gover∣nour of Bosilicula, marched with their uni∣ted Forces from their appointed Rendez∣vous at Terranova to Seminara, to fight the King or besiege him in the Town, who knowing nothing of their Conjunction, and ignorant of their number, issued out of the Town upon news of their approach to give them Battel, not staying for the Troops he expected from Puglia Campagnia and Arbuzzo, though Gonsalves, counted the expertest Captain of his Age, laboured to disswade him from fight; for being in the flower of Youth, and height of his Spirit, he rather strove to expose his Valour than hearken to good Counsel; and so having made an excellent Speech or Oration to animate the Captains and Souldiers to do their utmost, he marched towards Terranova three miles along the Hills; and coming to the River, lodged his Foot on the left Bank, and his Horse-men he stretched on the right to serve for a
Wing; and so continued to expect the Enemy. By this time the French and Switzers came in sight, and Obignny cast the latter into a firm Battalion, placing the Foot, raised in Calabria, behind them as a Battel of Suc∣cour, dividing the Squadron of Horse be∣tween them, being Men at Arms, and in the same order the light Horse-men; and so in a square Battel they pass d the River, whereupon the Spanish Horse advanced to oppose them, but being hotly charged by the thick Battalion of the French in the Advaunt-guard, after many of them were beaten down and slain, the rest were ob∣liged to retire, by fetching a compass in wheeling off to their main strength, which much discouraged the Arragonian Footmen, who at first supposed they were discomfi∣ted fled the Field, leaving them to the fu∣ry of the French, &c. The Horse-men thus forced to retreat, Obignny advanced with great speed, and charged the Foot-men on the right, whilst Persive did the like on the lest, disordering their Horse before the Switzers came to the fight, who no sooner came on but gave a furious Charge with their Pikes; so that the main Batte of King Ferdinand being broken and disor∣dered,
his Men were slain on all parts, nor did the Spanish Horse come timely to their Succour; nor could the King (though he laboured all eh could) restore the battel, notwithstanding (with a Troop of select Horse being his Guard) he charged despe∣rately amongst the thickest Ranks; and after having broken his Launce, drew his Sword and fought till he saw all manner of hopes to prevail were vain, and finding in his Army nothing but flight and fear∣ful Confusion, he at the perswasion of his Favorites got clear of the Battel and fled upon a swift Horse, yet by the way fell into a deep Pit with his Horse upon him, but was soon relieved by John Attavillia, who mounting the King upon his own Horse, he thereupon escaped; and him∣self on foot not capable of escaping, was slain by the Pursuers: so that he pay'd his Life to the safety of his Prince. Obignny having thus with much slaugh∣ter defeated the Kings Forces, and some being slain in the pursuit, called back his Souldiers, and encamped not far from  Place of Battel, upon which he was  by many as a Captain who  how to get a Victory, than to  obtained; for if the pursuit  few of the Kings Forces
had the Towns upon the Terror of this defeat failed to have surrendred upon sum∣mons, but staying here, the King with many of his Nobles got safe to their Ships, and Gonsalves with his rallied Troops found means ot retreat to Rezo. Thus by Neglect, a Battel when't was gain'd, Not being unprov'd, the Gen'rals Honour stain'd. A Description of the Battel of Vaila or Giard∣da, fought in Lumbardy, between Lewis the Eleventh of France, and the Seignory of Venice, Anno 1509. UPon the Venetians making their In∣croachments in Italy and other Pla∣ces, to impower and enrich themselves up∣on what appertained to others, Lewis the French King, aided by divers Princes, marched from Millan with an Army to hinder their Proceedings, and oblige them  Restitution, who likewise prepared to  him, with a great Army encamp∣  the River Adda, under the  the Earl of Petillia their Gene∣  D Alvina Master of the  were joyned George Cor∣  Grittie Providitors, who  the French, kept in a
strong Lodgment till they might find an advantageous Opportunity to draw out or decamp, which made the King seize upon Vaila and Pandino, that by the help of those Garrisons he might cut off their Provision, and by that means the sooner to oblige them to fight; nor did that Stratagem fail of its desired end, for the Venetian General knowing that by that means he must come to a Battel, drew out his Army on the right Bank of the River, consisting of 2000 men at Arms, and 20000 Foot-men, besides about 4000 Light-Horsemen, most∣ly Italians and Greeks, whilst over-against them on the other Bank, marched the French Army, consisting of 2000 men at Arms, 6000 Switzers, 12000 Gascones and Italian Foot men, with a considerable num∣ber of Pioneers, and many Field-pieces; and the Venetians being incumbred with the Bushes and Shrubs that grew on their side, were forced to march slowly, so that the French out-marched them, placing in their Avaunt-guard 500 men at Arms, and a Regiment of Switzers under the leading of Charles de' Ambroise, and John James de Trivulzi, which Vaunt-guard find∣ing means to pass the River before the Venetians expected it, attack'd the Rear of the Venetian Army commanded by Alvia,
consisting of 8000 men at Arms, and al∣most all the best foot-men, which made him to send to the Earl of Petillia, who led the Vaunt-guard, to inform him of the Necessity there was to fight, but he return∣ed answer, that he ought to march on and shun the Enemy as much as in him lay, for such was the order of the Senate; yet Alvian, carried away with the desire of Glo∣ry, resolved with such Forces as he had to bear the brunt of the Battel rather than to be out-braved, or so meanly suffer his Ho∣nour to be eclipsed; whereupon placing his Foot-men with six pieces of Cannon on a little Bay made by a certain wind∣ing of a Brook which was then dry, he with his great shot having disordered the French Foot, furiously broke in upon them and put them into great Confusion, their Horse (by reason of the Vines that grew in that Place) not being well able to sup∣port them; so that the King seeing his men put to the worst, and ready to fly, hasted to their Succour with fresh Troops, and by degrees drew Alvian into the Plain, so that the Avaunt-guard and middle Bat∣tel had Opportunity to charge him, though he wanted not Courage to make great re∣sistance, exciting them in all parts (with his Hands, Voice and Actions) to fight
courageously; nor did the French (when they saw their King in the Battel) charge with less fury, so that a bloody and doubt∣ful fight continued, though the Earl was not come up with the rest of the Forces, but the Venetians having fought with sin∣gular Valour for the space of three hours, and not being succoured, were in the end over-powered by the number of the French Horse-men, who breaking in amongst the ranks of the Foot, wearied already by a stout resistance, having done all that could be expected from true Valour, and lost ra∣ther Strength than Courage; they yet for the most part never turned their backs, but either died or were taken Prisoners fighting in the Place: so that had the other part of the Army succoured them, they had been victorious. In this Battel 8000 are reputed to be slain, and 2000 ta∣ken Prisoners, amongst which was Alvian, and soon after most of the Places the Vene∣tians had won surrendered; the Generals Excuse was that he had Command from the Senate not to fight. Thus by Neglect, or a bad tim'd Command, Battels are gone that ne'r can be regain'd; And that which Years with Blood and Labour cost, In one Ill-faughten Field few hour's hast lost.
A Description of the Battel of Ginghat, fought in Picardy between Henry the Eighth, King of England, and Monsieur de Pi∣ennes General for Lewis the French King, Anno 1513. KIng Henry the Eighth lying at the Siege of Turwin, which he beleagured with three Camps, the first commanded by himself, the second by the Earl of Shrews∣bury, and the third by the Lord Herbert; upon notice that the French Army was coming to its relief, he passed over the River with a considerable part of his Ar∣my detached for that purpose, whilst the remainder continued the siege, furnished with Ordinance and all other Necessaries to impeach or hinder their march, their Army consisting of 15000 effectual men, part of which were sent over the River ar below the Town to relieve it, whilst the rest intended only to skirmish with the Kings Army, and so to make their retreat as well as they could when the Business was effected, for the besieged were indeed in a great Straight for want of Provision, when the King, to shew the little dread he had of the French, not so much as taking down his Tents, but leaving the Lord Darcy with
a small Train to guard them, advanced his Standard, the Horse marching a mile before the Foot, which the Germans that were in the Kings Army perceiving, on a sudden imbattelled by themselves on the Right, which gave some suspition that they intended to revolt, though it proved otherwise; yet by this means they left the front of the Kings Battel unguarded; but that undaunted Monarch, not to be amu∣zed, nor in the least doubting the Victory, which never yet had failed him, kept on his way, and before he came within sight of the French, was met by Maximilian, Em∣perour of Germany, who had for his Guard 30 men at Arms well appointed, and wearing Red Crosses, when a Council be∣ing called, it was agreed that divers pieces of Ordnance being commodiously planted to incommode the Enemy in their ap∣proach; the Horse, in the head of which the King would have marched, but at the intreaty of his Nobles was perswaded to remain with the Foot as safest; with him stayed the Emperour, and amongst the Avaunt-guard were mounted divers Ar∣chers; which Resolves of the Council were scarce put in Execution before the French Army appeared marching in three long or extended battels, whereupon the Earl of
Essex, who commanded the greater part of the English Horse, and Sir John Pechey with another Squadron of English and Bur∣gundian Horse, marched in the Valley with Banners display'd, whilst the Lords Wallon and Ligney with the Burgundian Horse made a squadron seperate, and the foot moved in a gross battel, and so ascending from the lower to the higher Ground, Sir Henry Guilford, under whose charge the Archers on Horse-back were to the number of an 100, drew out as the forlorn hope, and skirmished with the Avaunt-guard of the French till the rest of the Horse came up, at what time they alighted, and strong∣ly intrenching, served as part of a Wing to flank the Foot, and the Battel joyning with great fury, so that the English Horse-men (crying St. George) charging in the Front, and the Archers continually pour∣ing in their shot of Arrows, the French bat∣tel was in a manner over-set at the first charge, for many of their Standards being overthrown, and some that commanded slain, they in great Confusion began to shrink together, and such as could conve∣niently disrank at that time fled, throwing away their Weapons, and cuting off the Barbs of their Horses to fly the lighter, whilst the English (who were far inferior
to them in number of Horse, viz. scarce one to ten) had little to do but follow the Execution and take prisoners; for though the Burgundian Horse came not in till the Battel was in a manner won, yet such was the fear of the French, that those who were in the Rear perceiving the Vaunt-guard in rout, fled without striking a stroke, as likewise did divers Troops who were not come to the Battel, for having notice of what had hapned by some that fled, they faced about and fled foremost; so that the chace being hotly made for the space of three miles, the Earl of Essex upon such an easie Victory fearing some Ambush, caus∣ed the retreat to be sounded, and returned to the Kings Battel which had not fought, bringing many Prisoners of Note, and much Riches; for in this Battel, fought on the sixth of August, were taken the Duke of Longuvile, the Lord Cleremont, and other Noble-men and Gentle-men, to the num∣ber of 242, besides what the Burgundians took and concealed in order to release them at lesser Ransomes than otherwise would have been taken. As for the slain they were not above 800, wherefore in consideration of the small resistance and cowardly flight, the French-men have nam'd it the Battel of Spurs. Nor did those that were appointed
to attack the Earl of Shrewsbury's Camp succeed better; for being no sooner skir∣mished with by Sir Rice ap Thomas, but they faced about and fled, and though the besieged sallied, yet were they valiantly repulsed by the Lord Herbert, who with considerable slaughter pursued them to the Gates of the Town, so that despairing of Relief they yielded up the Place to the King, as likewise did the famous City of Tournay. Thus fail'd French Valour, thus the English sought, By Gallick Pow'rs the Dastard Nation fought, (And they soon Conquer) Nations that the Field Will leave for threats, or un-try'd Battels yield. That th' English are not such, Fames Scroles make good, Oft writ in France like Draco's Laws in Blood. A Description of the Great and Memorable Bat∣tel fought on the Banks of the River Bori∣sthenes, between Bassilius the Great Duke of Moscovy, and Constantine General of Sigismund, King of Poland, Anno 1514. BAssilius the Great Duke of Muscovy ha∣ving taken Smolensco from the Poles by surprize, not contented therewith, advan∣ced with an Army of 40000 Horse to waste Lithuania; to oppose whose Pro∣gress King Sigismund sent Constantine his
General, a Man of great Experience in Martial Affairs, and under his Command 2000 men at Arms, 12000 Lithuanians, mostly Archers, and 3000 Foot-men, Pikes intermixed with Harquibusiers: nor did the Great Duke hinder their passing the River Boristhenes, supposing by that means to have them the surer in his Power, but making a moving Oration to incourage his Souldiers, he detached about 7000 Horse-men, whom he commanded by a great compass fetched about, to place themselves at the Rereward of the Poles, that when the Battel was joyned and hot on all parts, they might break in upon them, with strict order to cover them∣selves till an Opportunity offered, in a Neighbouring Valley overshadowed with Woods, and the rest of his Army he di∣vided into three squadrons, placing a Wing of 12000 Horse-men on the Right, com∣manded by Michael Golujza, the second he placed as a left Wing, but somewhat at a distance under the Hills, that it might be as a reserve or Battel of Succour, and the middle Battel himself commanded, where was his Baggage, and therein he placed the Strength of his Army. Whilst this was doing, Constantine was not Idle, but proposing to himself that
the unarmed Moscovites would be much Inferior to him in Prowess, though Su∣perior in number, if he could bring his Men into such Order that they might without any great damage sustain the first shock of the Archers, and suddenly bring the Battel to be tried by the Sword, where∣fore he placed the men at Arms in the front, ranging them in wedged Battel, ma∣king two Wings of the Lithuanian Horse, and placed the Foot behind the Men an Arms to support them; and so riding from Rank to Rank he admonished them to do their utmost for the Honour of their King and Country, and not by any Cow∣ardize in them be a means to lose a Battel upon which depended their Lives and Liberties, &c. He would have proceeded, but whilst he was speaking the Moscovi sounded the Charge, whereupon com∣manding the Captains in the Vaunt-guard to break in upon the Enemy with their Spears, mauger their shot of Arrows, each battel moved furiously, and although the Arrows flew thick as Hail, yet the Poles passed on, though some, yet but a few o them were slain; so that the Archers be∣ing frustrated in a trice, they brought i to the Sword, so that the Lithuanian stretching out their Wings, and the
straitning them, made good their Archers, who sorely gauled the Moscovites, who be∣ing on all sides in a manner oppressed, could neither give back, nor brake through in the front, and those that were behind still thrusting them forward, break their Ar∣ray, bearing out side-ways upon the Wings of the Lithuanians, so at one time they at∣tacked two Incounters in divers places, so that the fight being hot on all parts, and the Duke finding himself over-charged, sent to Command the Horse-men in Am∣bush to advance, who soon discovered themselves, and came on with horrid crys and sounds of Trumpets, to be thought more dreadful in their number, which the Polonian General perceiving, ordered his Battel to stand firm, yet Polosky, a Pala∣tine of that Kingdom, turned on them a squadron of Foot-men which had not been much shaken, and sustaining the first shock of their Arrows, gave Command for all the Harquibusiers to fire at once, and so by a swift advance came to the push of Pike and Halbert, causing the Moscovite Horse-men to recoil, yet their Ranks be∣ing close they could not expand them∣selves, or travers their Ground, by reason of which they were obliged to sustain the fight in that narrow compass with great
slaughter; so that it was a pitious sight to see Men and Horses dead, lying on heaps, weltering in Blood, and groaning out their last, whilst in that part where the General fought, the Ranks of Moscovites were bro∣ken and disordered, and the Right Wing of Horse almost all cut in pieces; so that the middle Battel) wherein was yet the Person of the Great Duke) was attacked on all sides, and the foremost Ranks pier∣ced through, so that he despairing to re∣store the fight, gave back; and now the Foot that had routed his Ambushment of Horse having nothing to do, charged up∣on his Battel of Succour, and entring their Ranks who had been shaken before by the Lithuanian Horse, they with their Pikes and Scimiters made a miserable slaughter, putting them in all parts to the rout; of which the Duke having notice, and how those Horse he had laid in Am∣bush were likewise defeated, whom he scarce thought as yet to have made their attack; he with a Troop of his Nobles that were his Guard, retired out of the Battel, and left his Men to shift for them∣selves, making all the speed he could to escape that Ruin and Desolation into which he had brought his Army, which once known, nothing but flight and con∣fusion
followed, whilst the Poles had the Execution of them for many Miles with great slaughter. In this Battel, fought on the eighth of Sep∣tember, 13000 men were slain, and many of them of Note; all the Baggage and rich Pavilions, with the Great Dukes Standard taken, as likewise was Michael Goliza, but Smolensco being strongly fortified could not be regained. Thus Blood still flows, thus cruel Mars still raves, And Drowns the Plains with Seas of Purple Waves. A Description of the Great and Memorable Battel fought in Persia near the City of Coy or Coios, between Hysmael the Persian Sophi, and Selymus, the First of that Name, Emperour of the Turks. SElymus, to obtain the Diadem, having caused his Father Bajazet the Second to be poysoned, and to secure himself in the Throne, strangled his three Brethren, being grieved that his two Nephews Amurath and Aladine yet lived, the one by securing him∣self in the Persian Court, and the other in that of the AEgyptian Sultan, upon the for∣mer's making some Inrodes into Capadocia,
he took an opportunity to quarrel with Hys∣mael the Persian Sophy; and thereupon rai∣sing an Army of 300000 Horse and Foot, and under pretence of his having aided his Rebels, he marched to invade his Country; and so drawing his People after him over the huge Mountains of Scodrasci, Moscii, and Ante-Taurus, he passed along the Banks of the River Euphrates holding his way East∣ward till he came to the River Araxis, where he found all the Country wasted and de∣stroyed by the Persians; upon which, the Ar∣my began to fall into great want of many things, so that the Souldiers were forced to feed upon wild Fruits, when, in the mean time Ʋsta-Ogli the Persian General approach∣ed him with an Army of 80000 Horse; and whilst either Army was at some distance one from the other, Hysael came in Person to his Camp, and from thence sent a Heraul to Selymus to know why in a Hostile man∣ner he had entred his Country, having no Title thereto; to which the Turk hautily re∣ply'd, That his Grandfather, his Uncle, and himself, had greatly endamaged the Ot∣toman Empire, by making several Incroach∣ments, Inrodes, and Invasions; and aiding the Rebels in the Reigns of Mahomet, Baja∣zet, and his own, yet he esteemed them not a sufficient ground of War, but sought after
his Enemy, young Amurath, his Brother's Son, who had lately wasted Cappadocia, whom if he would quietly and friendly de∣liver into his Hands, he would withdraw his Forces, but if he refused to gratifie him therein, he would with Fire and Sword not only destroy the Confines of Armenia, but the very heart of Persia. Notwithstand∣ing these promises and Threats, the Persian refused to comply with his demands in de∣livering up the young Prince to certain Death; yet for that day both Armies lay in their Trenches, but the next day they drew out, and each being put in Battel-Ar∣ray, and incouraged by moving Orations to do their utmost, the bloody blast was sound∣ed, after which the Persian Horsemen came on with great Futy, over-setting the Vaunt-guard, and overthrowing the Asapi by heaps: these are a sort of ordinary Souldiers pla∣ced by the Turks for the most part to dull the Swords of the Enemy with their Blood, and often set formost in Assaults to fill up the Trenches with their dead Bodies when they besieged a Town, that the Janizaries may pass the easier over them: nor was that all, for the Persians at the same time charged the Spahi or Turkish Horsemen in either Wing, causing them in some Confu∣sion to give Ground, which Selymus percei∣ving,
and finding they would soon charge the Battel of the Janizaries, (in the middle of which himself remained) he caused the Orders to open to the right and the left, where a Train of 60 pieces of Artillery was placed, and caused them to be dischar∣ged without Intermission upon the Horse-men, who likewise opened their Orders to avoid the murthering shot which over∣threw them by whole Ranks; yet the thun∣dring of the Cannon so amazed the Horse, not used to hear such Noises, nor see such deadly Engines vomit Flame, that they would not be ruled, but flouncing and floun∣dring, many of them cast their Riders, yet Hysmael with his Squadron still charging the Right Wing, composed of Asian Horse-men, cut a great number of them in pieces, but whilst Ʋsta Ogli his General was endea∣vouring to do the like in the other part, and entering too far amongst the Ranks, he was slain with a Harquibuss shot, which much abated the Courage of his Men; yet could they not be prevailed with to retire, till Se∣lymus advanced with the Battalion of the Janizaries, yet he gained but small Ad∣vantage, whereupon in a great Rage he commanded another Tire of Ordnance (which he had left as his last refuge) furi∣ously to be discharged upon the fighting
Squadrons, by which means such slaughter was made (as well of his own men as the Persians mingled together) in the attack, that what for the Dust, Smoke, and thun∣dring of the Artillery (having on both sides lost in a manner their Sight and Hearing) the Persian Horse were now so terrified, that they were no longer to be ruled, but dis∣ranking in divers parts, the battel became broken and disordered; at what time Hys∣mael having received a slight Wound with a Harquibuss-shot, was retired (at the Intrea∣ty of his Friends) to have it searched and dressed; and there having notice that his General was slain, as also what further had hapned, he caused the retreat to be sound∣ed, which was done in such order that the Turks durst not pursue them, nor durst they seize upon their Camp till they knew they were out of sight, in which they found divers rich Pavilions wrought with Needle-work and Gold, as also many beauteous Ladies that had accompanied their Husbands to the Wars, all of which he caused to be set at Liberty, except one of Hysmaels Wives, whom he gave in Marriage to one of his Bassa's. In this Battel fought in the Galderan fields near the City of Coy, Anno 1514, 30000 Turks were slain, and amongst them divers
Bassa's and Men of Note, even all the flow∣er of the Army, though of the Persians not above 8000, the chief of Note, being the General, and amongst the slain were found the bodies of divers Persian Women, who armed, had accompanied their Husbands to share in their good or evil Fortune, at which Selymus admiring, caused them to be ho∣nourably buried; and soon after had Tauris, and many other Cities put into his hands; but in his return through hardships, and such as were cut off by the Persians and Mounta∣neers, who still hover'd about his Camp to take all advantages, he lost near three parts of his Army. Thus Selymus with slaughter flesh'd at home Plotting fresh Murthers through strange Lands do's roame, (Like a Hircanian Tiger scenting blood) From cold Araxis to warm Nilus flood, Hastes to augment the Crimson stream late shed. A Discription of the great Battel fought between Campson Gaurus Sultan of Aegypt, and Selymus, the first of that Name, Emperour of the Turks, near Aleppo in Syria, &c. SElymus, the year after his Persian Expedi∣tion, having subdued the Kingdom of Aladeules the Mountain King, under pre∣tence
of Damage done him by the Mountai∣neers in his return, and getting the King in∣to his Hands by treachery, cut off his Head. Whilst he was taking some Towns belonging to the Persian Sophy, whom he heard was warring against the Indians and Bactrians, He had notice that Campson Gaurus Sultan of Aegypt was coming against him with a pow∣erful Army, levied in Aegypt and Judea, in favour of his Allie the Persian, as hating Se∣lymus for his Cruelty to his Father, Brethren and Nephews; whereupon fearing he should pass the River Euphrates, and spoil his Do∣minions in Asia, he sent Ambassadors to him to treat about renewing the League that had been between him and his Father Baja∣zet. But the young Princes, Aladine, Son to Mahomet, Selymus's elder Brother, and Ala∣deules, Son to the murther'd King of that Name, pressing the Sultan to restore them by his Arms in so just a Cause, his Embassy was rejected, whereupon, thinking it no time to delay, he resolved to give the Persians rest, and turn his Arms against the Aegyptian Sul∣tan, and thereupon passed the Mountains with an Army of 300000 Men at three Pla∣ces, causing the rough Passages to be made smooth, and the Straights to be opened for the more commodious passage of his Ord∣nance and Baggage, so that in five days, con∣trary
to the Expectation or Belief of the Sul∣tan, he had passed the huge Mountain of Amanus with his whole Army and all his Baggage, and Encamped in the Plains of Com∣megena, where, from Alis-Beg, Governour of the Mountain Kingdom, he had news of the Sultan's Army; so that he immediately marched towards him, when coming in sight of each other, and the Battel on both parts resolved upon; the Sultan divided his Army into four Battels, the first he commit∣ted to Kerebeus, the second to Sybevius, the third to Gazzeles, and the fourth himself re∣served as a Battel of Succour, as also to de∣fend the Camp; whilst on the other hand Selymus plac'd the Asian Horse-men in the Right wing, and the European's in the Left, and in the middle the battel of the Janiza∣ries, with the Artillery in the front of them, and between the two Wings his Pentioners, being Souldiers of great Experience; and in this Order the Turks always fight, if the Ground will permit it. The Battels ranged and set in order, Kere∣beius with his Squadron charged the Europe∣an Horse-men with great fury, but resolved now to be revenged on the Sultan for the death of his Brother; he intended nothing more than to betray his Trust; and there∣upon, after the first Charge, that he might
seem yet to do something, wheeling off, he fell upon the Sculions, and such other slaves as kept the Baggage, making some small slaughter of them, that at the same time, like a cunning Traytor, he might satisfie the Expectations of his Valour, and yet pene∣trate the Treason: But Sebeius the Gover∣nour of Damasco, behav'd himself far other∣wise, for entring overthwart the Ranks of the Right wing of the Turks Army, he with his Mamalukes charged with such fury, that having made great slaughter of the Asian Horse-men, he broke in like a Tempest, bearing down all before him till he charg'd upon the Ensigns in the midst of the wing, nor could Mustapha the Beglerbeg, nor Im∣brahor Bassa, with all their Forces stand be∣fore him or restrain the flight of their Souldi∣ers; so that cutting in pieces the Right wing, he resolutely thrust in between the Battali∣on of the Janizaries and Pentioners, there making so unexpected and lamentable a slaughter, that Selymus was in great danger of being taken; for by the breaking in of Sebeius, he was divided from his Foot-men, in whom he reposed his greatest Confidence; and now the Janizaries being hardly char∣ged by Gazzeles, who following the Fortune of Sebeius, were brought to great distress, nor could the routed Wing find any place of Retreat.
In this Confusion and Disorder, Sinan Bassa, who had been but lightly skirmished with by Kayerbeius, came in with the Left wing of Horse, and staid the fury of the Ma∣malukes, whereat the disperced Squadrons of the Turks rallying and taking fresh Cou∣rage, wrung the Victory out of their hands; which they could not have done had Camp∣son slighted the Baggage, and come in in time with his Squadron, or Kayerbeius been true to his Trust; but the other Comman∣ders having performed all that could be ex∣pected from men of Courage and Conduct; and now the thundering Ordnance playing upon the ingaged Squadron, as they had be∣fore on the Persian Horse-men, they found the Place too hot, and thereupon seering toge∣ther in a thick Troop, they broke through the midst of those that had enclosed them, making great slaughter of the European Horse-men and Pentioners, and so retir'd to∣wards the Camp and City of Aleppo; and being pursued by Sinan Bassa, whist Camp∣son Gaurus endeavoured to stay the flight and restore (if possible) the battel, he was borne from his Horse in the Crowd, and by reason of his Age, and the weight of his Armour, not being able to relieve himself, he was in that Hurry and Confusion troden to death; and being afterward found amongst
the slain, was expos'd to the view of the Peo∣ple, that they might not flatter themselves with his being alive. In this great battel, fought on the 17th of August 1516, no less than thirty thousand Turks were slain, and about the like number of Egyptians and Mamalukes, so that after two other mortal battels with Tomombeus, whom the Mamalukes chose their Sultan, af∣ter the death of Campson, one in the great City of Caire, which lasted three days with great Effusion of blood, and the other upon the banks of Nilus, no less dreadful, all the Rich Countries of Egypt and Palestine fell in∣to the hands of the Turks, who possess it to this day; for Tomombeus, flying after the last Defeat, was taken in a Marish among the Flags up to the Neck in Water, and brought to Selymus, who would not admit him to his Presence; but after he had rid upon a rugged Camel with his Face to the Tail quite thro' the City of Caire in derision, he was hanged upon a Hook, under the Gate of that City, and all the Mamalukes that could be found put to the Sword. Thus Turkish Cruelty do's wider spread, And Death in Triumph by their Swords is Lead, Glutted with Slaughter, he no Famine feels, But Drunk with Blood profusely shed, He reels.
A Description of the fatal Battel of Nugis, fought between Lewis King of Hungary, and Selymus, the First of that Name, Empe∣rour of the Turks, at Nugis in the King∣dom of Hungary, &c. LEwis King of Hungary, upon notice that Solyman was advancing to Invade his Kingdom with a powerful Army, and not being able to obtain Assistance of the neigh∣bouring Princes, raised the whole Power of his own Country, not amounting to above 30000 Men, and those but slenderly skill'd in the Trains of War, yet at the Perswasi∣ons of one Tomoreus, who promised him as∣sured Victory, telling him he had it by Re∣velation, the King young and unexperienc'd, rejected the Counsel of some grave Captains who foresaw the Danger of fighting eight to one, with an approved Warrior (for Soly∣man approached with no less than 300000 Men) and resolved to give the Turks bat∣tel; so that it was not long e'r both Armys confronted each other, near to a small Town called Nugis, between Belgrade and Buda, whenas the Turkish Commanders seeing the weakness of the King, besieged his Camp for many days, yet the said Tomoreus desist∣ed not to promise him Victory, and under∣took
to set the Army in Battel-array, and indeed it was now too late to think of Re∣treating without fighting their way through; so that the Foot being stretch'd in a long Line as commodiously as the Place would allow, they were supported by the Horse al∣most in the like manner, that they might not be absolutely inclosed, or if they were, by doubling their Lines they might cast them∣selves into a Ring, or Oval battel; whilst the Camp intrenched or barrocado'd with chain'd Wagons was left on the right hand to secure the approach on that part, though but slenderly guarded, and near thereunto was placed a Regiment of the most experi∣enc'd Horse-men for the security of the King's Person, who would not be perswaded to reserve himself for a better Day, by with∣drawing from the Camp e're the battel was joyned; so that now the great Guns on ei∣ther part begun to play furiously, though doing little damage, yet the Turkish Squa∣drons advancing upon the first Charge, the Hungarian Horse gave ground, and soon af∣ter broke their Array, which so discouraged the Foot-men, that they scarcely made any Resistance; but throwing away their Wea∣pons, were miserably slain; and in less than two hours space the whole Army was in Rout, upon which the Turks following the
Execution, not above 5000 escaped, all the flower of the Nobility of that Kingdom be∣ing slain, and the King attempting to escape, plunged with his Horse into a miry Place, where none coming to his Assistance, he was stifled; nor did Tomoreus escape, but fell to augment the number of the slain. After this fatal Blow was given to Hungary, which was follow'd by innumerable Calamities, occasi∣oned by Civil Dissentions. Solyman entred Buda, and taking out of the Castle divers Brazen Statues, placed there by Matthias Cor∣vinus, he departed to Constantinople, leaving the Kingdom in a manner desolate, especi∣ally of its Nobility. Thus Rashness (see) a mighty Ruine wrought, And a free Kingdom to Subjection brought, Which almost ever since has Groan'd with War, And hides more slain than in't the living ar'. A Description of the Battel of Pavye, fought between Francis the French King, and Charles Duke of Burbon, Charles de Le∣noy, and the Marquess of Picara, Generals for Charles the Fifth, Emperour of Ger∣many. THE French and Imperialists contending for the Sovereignty of Italy with vari∣ous Fortunes, and Francis the French King
endeavouring to recover the Dutchy of Mil∣lain, the Duke of Burbon, Charles Lanoy Vice Roy of Naples, and the Marquess of Piscara drew out an Army to oppose his proceedings, so that after some time spent in training their Souldiers, and putting them in order, it came to a pitched Field, and the Generals exhort∣ing their Souldiers to do their utmost Endea∣vours to gain Honour and Fame; the great Ordnance began to thunder on either part, but that of the French being on the lower Ground, had much the Advantage, the shot whereof passing through the Ranks of the German Horsemen greatly incommoded them, which the Commanders perceiving, drew their battels closer, and after some doubt∣ful fight (whilst the Battel had wandered over the Field) came to a bloody Encoun∣ter on all hands, so that the slaughter grew hot, and the Wings still charging each other, each Nation strove by all possible means to express its Valour; for in this battel fought not only French and Germans, but Spaniards, Italians, and Switzers, indifferently on ei∣ther side, being Mercenary Souldiers, and hired for pay, and especially the French, for the Honour of their King, who spared not at once to give command and charge the Enemy, ranging through the fiercest attack, as knowing that if he lost that Battel, it
would be hard for him to escape; nor were the black Battalion of Almayns (fighting on the Part of the King) less diligent in char∣ging the Switzer; so that one party ingaging after another, they fought in the end in all parts; so that the field was in a trice cover∣ed with the bodies of the slain, and so eager were they to shed blood, that they minded not as yet the taking of Prisoners on either side, by reason of which many men of Note were slain that might have been made Pri∣soners; and amongst others Solice, whose Horse being slain under him, and he op∣pressed with Armour, would have yielded to the Captain of the Squadron of Horse that fought on that part, but a certain Spani∣ard, envying the Horse should have the Ransom of so Noble a Prisoner, bent his Harquibuss against his Brest and killed him on the Place; also Tremoville, an other great Captain that had in his time won many great Victories, was shot upon the like ac∣count; and Galeazo Sansenerino was slain in the Kings sight: so that the Imperialists pres∣sing on, (as having brought their whole strength into the Field) many Gallant men were slain, and especially of the Horse, who were for the most part in the heart of the bat∣tel, sustaining not only the Charge of Horse against Horse, but frequently of the Foot-men
who flanked them, so that the shot fly∣ing like hail, a great number were over∣whelm'd, Men and Horses strugling together for Life, and many being dismounted were trampled to death; so that it frequently hap∣ned, that the Front of the Battel was so bar∣rocaded with the slain, that neither Party could well advance to break into the Squa∣drons, especially those on Horse-back; and now the Switzers over-charged, began to give ground, in striving to restrain which, the Lord Bonevet was slain, and the King's Guard being miserably cut off with the shot of the Foot-men, he was left almost void of Succour, to the fury of the Enemy, and ma∣ny who loved their Lives dearer than their Honour left him, and scatter'd in all parts, which the King perceiving, and that it was now but too apparent that the battel went against him, having fought courageously, and done all that could be expected from a great a Cptain; he laboured to get from amongst his Enemies; but being surround∣ed by the Horsemen of divers Nations, tho' they knew not directly who he was, yet supposing him a Person of Note, they pres∣sed hard upon him, nor did he forget him∣self, though he was forsaken by his Guard, but continually wheeling his Horse to avoid the thickest of his Pursuers, defended him∣self
with his Sword, both giving and taking divers Wounds; but whilst he attempted a Bridg that passed over a Water-course or small Rivolet, his Horse was thrust in with a Pike, falling immediately down, in which fall he was much bruised; so that he bled in abundance, lying at the same time with his Leg under the Horse, and not able to relieve himself, when one Didaco de Aebil∣la, and John Orbieta a Biscaian, coming in, and not well knowing him in that Conditi∣on, shook their Swords over him, and willed him to yield, or he was a dead man; but whilst he disdained to reply, or at least to discover himself, Monsieur de La Motte came up, who knowing the King, kept off the Crowd, and relieving him from the misery he lay in, required him to yield himself to the Duke of Burbon, whom he said was at hand, but that duke, having revolted from the King, whose Feudetary he was he grew angry, and in a chafe at his very Name, fiercely replying, No, but call me hither Lenoy, who in the end being sought for in all parts came of himself, and removed the great Crowd from about the King, who pressed on all sides to see him. It being known throughout the field that the King was made a Prisoner, the Courage of those French that yet stood to it, altoge∣ther
failed them, so that the Imperialists cry∣ing every where Victory, they fled in all parts, as likewise did the Switzers that sought on the Kings side, fearfully running into the River Teniso, where being unskilful in swimming, they were drowned in whole Troops; and those that remained on shore, although they threw down their Arms, and begged for Life, were mostly slain, and all the Spoil of the Camp, besides much rich Furniture of Horse and Armour taken, as likewise was Henry King of Navar, and a great number of the French Nobility: and the Count of St. Paul lying on the Ground wounded, a Spaniard cut off his Finger to take his Ring, which he could not other∣wise get off. As for the Duke of Alanson, who with a Regiment of Horse he brought during the Battel, having stood a while a looker on, he turned Tail and fled with those under his Command into France, to tell the doleful News. In this Battel, fought Anno 1523, upwards of 10000 men were slain, and as many wounded and taken Prisoners, not reckon∣ing those that were drowned in the River Ten. so. As for the King, he soon after obtain∣ed his Liberty, in consideration of his quit∣ting claim to Millain, Naples, and Asti, as al∣so his Superiority over Artois and Flanders,
paying moreover to the Emperour 120000 Crowns. By this we see how Fortune deals with Kings, Casting in doubtful chance all Earthly things. He who an Army late in Triumph led, Bereft of Power's a woful Captive made. A description of the Battel of Gabiniano, fought between Philbert Prince of Orange, General for the Emperour Charles the Fifth, and Franaio a Captain of the Florentines, Anno 1530. THE Florentines having banished the Family of the Medic's, the Emperour Charles the Fifth was so far offended thereat, that he caused his Forces under the Com∣mand of Philbert Prince of Orange, straitly to besiege the City of Florence in Italy, which being accordingly done, the Citizens resolved to send for Farnaio, a Captain of theirs, who was abroad with some Troops on the Frontiers, who by his falling into the Imperial Quarters whilst they sallied out of the City, might be a means to raise the Siege, and so without further delay they sent Han, a chosen Messenger, promising him great Rewards if he prospered therein, which made him incontinently gather what
Forces he could, and advance with all ima∣ginable Diligence and Secrecy, yet his Ap∣proach was made known by the Imperial Espials. The Prince of Orange sent to Fabri∣co Marmaldo, and Alexander Vitteli, who lay with their Regiments in the Territories of Pisa, to haste to the Camp, yet take such a way that they might follow in the Ear of Franaio's Troops, and fall upon him as they found their Advantage, whilst himself with a detached Power would oppose him in the Front, which accordingly hapned after some skirmishing by the way in the Town of Gabiniano; so that there the fury of the bat∣tel increasing, they fought on all parts with great Fury, especially in the Market-place, where Franaio leaping from his Horse, and taking a Pike in his Hand, greatly incoura∣ged his Souldiers, nor failed Marmaldo to do the like, who casting his men in a thick wedge, sustained the charge valiantly, whilst a part of Franaio's Foot sheltring amongst the Chesnut Trees that grow thick towards the Wall of the Town, poured in their shot like Hail, and as they saw it convenient, ad∣vanced in parties, and having camisado'd the Enemy, as soon retired; which the Prince of Orange (who fought on Horse∣back) perceiving, pressed on to dislodge them, to whose Relief with a Troop of
Horse, came Nicholas Mussio, a Greek of great strength, with whom the Prince fought hand to hand, and although Mussu with his Battel-Ax had bruised his Helmet, the Prince still pursued him with his Sword, but entering too far amongst the Trees, he received two mortal Wounds by Harqui∣buss shot, and fell from his Horse, and in∣stantly died; (being stripped by the Souldi∣ers of his Cloth of Siver-Coat, and guilt Armour; whereupon his Men were so dis∣couraged that many of them fled away fear∣fully and unpursued; of which Advantage Franaio laying hold, cried Victory, the better to hearten his own Souldiers, and drawing his Troops close together, made a desperate charge on those that yet stood firm, so that the Streets were covered with dead Bodies, and the Channels murmur'd with Streams of Blood, nor had Victory failed to have de∣clared on his part, had not the Lansquenets of German Foot (who were placed without the Town as a Battel of Succour) advanced and restored the fight; for upon the flying of Rusales, a Collonel of Horse, with those under his Command, the News was carried to the Camp before Florence, that the Prince was slain, and his Army routed, but these fresh Forces coming on and renewing the fight with great fury, the Florentines, after
they had disputed Street by Street, and House by House with the Imperials, found themselves too weak to make any further resistance; so that Franaio, and Paul his Lieutenant, after they had for many hours defended a strong House, and from thence with their shot and Wild-fire overthrown many of their Enemies, finding the battel inevitably lost, yielded themselves to Mar∣maldo, when being brought into his Presence armed as they were taken, he said to Fra∣naio in a great Rage, And did you think when you hanged up my Drummer against the Law of Arms, it would have been my Fortune to have had you in my Power? To which Franaio without the least shew of fear or dejection replyed, This is the chance of War, and the like may also befall you, serving in the War; but if you take my Life, you shall gain by my Death neither Profit, Honour, or Praise: yet Marmaldo having caused him to be disarmed, wounded him with his Sword in the Throat, and left him to the Souldiers to be dispatched, who in∣continently slew him. Nor fell there in this Encounter less than 2000 men, being the more memorable for that the two Generals were slain, with many more of Note; upon News of which defeat of their Forces, the Florentines yielded up the City, having de∣fended
it to the last Extremity, leaving no unclean thing un-eaten; whereupon the Emperour deprived them of their Franci∣ses, and made Alexander d' Medicis (base Son of Lawrence d' Medicis) Duke of Flo∣rence, and of all the Countries depending thereon. Thus one Succesless Battel Florence lost, And a free State with servile Bondage cro'st, Made Italy's chief Garden droop her Head, As if her sragrant Flowers had all been dead. A Description of the Memorable Battel of Cheresoles, fought in Peimont between Alphons, Marquess of Guisto, General for Charles the Fifth, Emperour, and France Duke of Anghien, General for Francis the French King, Anno 1544. FRancis Duke of Anghien; with a grea Power laving Siege to Carignano,  strong Town in Peimont, Alphons, Marque of Guisto, Governour of that Province fo Charles the fifth, Emperour of Germany thought it highly concerned him to hinde so important a Place from falling into th Hands of the French, and thereupon draw∣ing his Forces into a Body, he resolved to raise the Siege at the hazard of a battel; no
was not many days before the Armies con∣fronted each other, and began the fight (after they were arranged in battel array) with their Cannon, and thereupōn the Squardrons of Horse moved with great Courage; the first that charged being the Horsemen of Thermes and Balleone, which charge they maintained with so much Va∣lour, that many were slain on either part, and a great many borne to the Ground with their Lances, who for the most part were troden to death by the Horses, so that they soon came to use their Swords and Battel-Axes; but Thermes at length bending his Forces upon the Italian Foot-men, was beaten from his Horse, and taken Prisoner by a common Souldier, nor could Baleone's Wing (by reason of its being much in∣ferior in number) long resist the French men at Arms; so that many in that sharp conflict were slain, and amongst them Ju∣lio Azzo, Son to the Prince of Tuderto and Baleone, having his Horse slain under him, himself at the same time wounded, hardly escaped being taken Prisoner; but the bat∣tel under the Command of Raimond de Cor∣dona and Seisneich had better fortune, for charging upon the Grevers, a sort of Soul∣diers brought up in the Territories of Ge∣neva, they so plied them with Harquibuss-shot,
that they put their Battel into much disorder, and won from them the Ground they had a long time maintained; as like∣wise a Cottage that sheltered them from the shot of the other Wing, with some pieces of Ordnance; nor was it effected without great slaughter on either side, so that a Troop of Horsemen were immedi∣ately sent to succour them, lest they should be all cut off. In this Encounter Monsiew Destro and Charles Drosse, Collonels of Horse, were slain, as also Monsieur de Assier, a young Gentleman of great hope; for the Spaniard, desirous to revenge old Wrongs, pressed furiously upon the French-men in this part of the battel, insomuch that they obliged them to retire with great slaugh∣ter, even to the Gates of Carmagnola, and at the same time the German Foot, who had lain upon the Ground to avoid the shot o the great Ordnance, rose up and set for∣ward to the battel, and Aliprando their Commander going some paces before them, challenged out Monsieur de Mole, a Captain of the French, to fight him i single Combat, which after being accept∣ed, both Captains mounted, and running furiously together, fell both of them grie∣vously wounded, one in the Eye, and the other in the Cheek, and thereupon the
Souldiers rushing together to their rescue, great slaughter ensued; for Aliprandoe's Re∣giment, that joyned as the Advance-guard, was not so suddenly re-inforced as intend∣ed, which in the end being over-matched by the men at Arms, made them wheel off, which did not a little discourage their Fellows, who suddenly coming on, had their flank left open to the shot of the main battel, and those Horse that wheeled off, (being charged upon as flyers, altho the Marquess laboured to make them face about, finding no place amongst the Squa∣drons to make their retreat good) entered amongst the Ranks of the German foot, which put them into great Confusion, for finding their battel was behind the Ensigns, they brake quite through, and the French likewise pressing on, got in at the breach, making great slaughter, especially of the hindermost of those that fled, and when the Switzers who stood over-against the Italians, perceived this wavering, as like∣wise the slaughter of the Germans, they likewise fell upon them with great fury, neglecting the Italians, with whom it was expected they would have ingaged; so that they who before were hard enough put to it by the Gascoins and old Switzers, who fought in their front, and weakned
by the breaking in of their own Horse, (the French Horse likewise charging them in the Rear) were not able to withstand the fresh charge, but their Captains being most slain, and their Ensigns thrown down, turned their backs and fled; yet being hot∣ly pursued, they were most or them slain, and amongst them divers men of great Note, viz. Vulcain, Son to the Earl of Fur∣stemberg, Michael Preusinger, Lieutenant to Brannor, Scaliger, Antonya Ʋrste a Captain of Great Fame, Hildebrand Tunnie, Balthasar Chaldese, James Figero, Matrice Bursea, Adam Brall, and the Baron of Grimstein: and Aliprando near dead of his Wound, was found amongst the dead bodies and taken Prisoner; and when the Italian foot per∣ceived the Germans broken and dispersed, and that the Horsemen had left the Field, they made good their retreat, and with little loss got about Midnight to Asti, whi∣ther the Horsemen were gotten before them, and soon after came the Marquess with his Helmet much bruised and batter∣ed, and shot with a Harquibus-shot into the Knee, so that the Victory was intirely left to the French. And of the 40000 that were in the Field on both sides, 12000 are acounted to be slain, whereupon Carignan surrendred to the Duke of Haghein.
Thus Peimont sees the blood of Foreign Lands Reeking in Streams upon her thirsty Sands, Such is the Fate where cruel War Commands. A Description of the Battel of Lochen, fought in Saxony, between Charles the Fifth, Em∣perour of Germany, and John Fredrick, Dake of Saxony, on the twenty fourth of April, Anno Dom. 1547. THE Emperour Charles the Fifth be∣ing displeased with divers Princes of the Empire, and the mis-understanding growing daily greater, they thought it the surest way to arm on all parts, and stand upon their Guard, which making the Em∣perour suppose it the best way to fight them separate, he pursued John Fredrick Duke of Saxony upon his return into his own Country, by such speedy marches that the Advaunt-guard of his Army attacked the Saxons before they expected they were ar∣rived in those parts, which created much Fear and Consternation; yet maintaining only a kind of a flying fight till the gross battalions came up, the Duke had leisure to put his Troops in Order, and formed his Battel in this wise. viz. He
commanded the Foot-men of the Earl of Bichenlinghen, in whom he reposed the greatest trust, and the Horse-men of John Ponecan and Gaugulph of Eslenhen, to take their Stations in the front, ordering them that if they charged they should retire, and avoid, as much as in them lay, entering in∣to a hot dispute, till the signal was given to assure them the other Battels were in a readiness; then he cast 6000 foot-men in∣to two Squadrons, and supported them with 500 Horse-men, riding himself from Rank to Rank, to give necessary Orders and Directions for what was wanting, pla∣cing another 2000 Horse as a Wing to cover the Foot on the Right side, and so closing his Battel to prevent the Enemies breaking in, he stood in array to expect the Event, whilst the Emperour, with whom was the King of Romans, and the Great duke of Alva, placed in the Vaunt-guard of his Ar∣my 600 Launces, with 600 Hungarian Horse-men, 700 Italian Horse-men, and 100 Har∣quibusiers on Horse-back, then he divided them into three Troops, the Hungarians he placed on the Right wing, the Germans on the left, and the Italians in the middle, and of the rest of the Forces he made his battel, dividing it into three Squadrons, of whom he committed one to the charge of the
King of Romans, but the others he led himself, the one consisting of 700 Horse-men, and the other of 1000, part Lances, and part Harquibuses, commanding the whole Army to advance in such order that the front might be broad and extended, that so they might prevent being inclosed; and thus-both Armies being in array, and the Duke not perceiving it commodious to retire, proceeded with a moving Ora∣tion to incourage his Men by putting them in mind of the Prowess and Valour of their Ancestors, and exhorting them to fight like men for their Liberties, Lives, Wives, Children, and Country, and that for his part he would not be wanting to fight or succour as occasion should require it. Nor was the Emperour wanting to in∣courage his Souldiers to the like effect, so that now there being nothing wanting but the Signal to joyn battel, that was not long delayed, for the Trumpets suddenly sounding, the Imperial Battel moved with great swiftness, but the Horse coming into dirty and slippery Ground, were so mired, that the Ear-guard was forced to give back till the Advaunt guard had passed it, lest by pressing on they should have broken the Array, and caused Confusion and Dis∣order to have ensued, which gave the
Saxons Opportunity to charge the Front before the Rear could come up, insomuch that a hot and desperate fight ensued, for the battel being begun in the Right-wing, the Saxons poured in their shot like Hail, and had made great slaughter, had not the Italian and Hungarian Light-Horse-men come in, and charged them in another part; which for a time allay'd their fury: whilst in another part the men at Arms of Naples, and the German Harquibusiers sore∣ly pressed their main battel, so that the Advaunt-guard became open, and began to scatter, although the Duke laboured all that in him lay to keep his men in their Ranks, and to admonish them with Words and Actions to do their utmost to support his Honour; yet fear had so pos∣sessed them, that they could not be kept in their Battels, but began incontinently to disrank; so that the Imperialists thrusting into their Array, brought them in a short time into great Distress and Confusion; whereupon the Duke finding the Day lost, used what Industry he could to make an orderly retreat into the Neighbouring Wood, but by reason his Array was bro∣ken, the Imperialists entered with him, ma∣king great slaughter of his men, and pres∣sed so furiously upon him, that although he
stoutly defended himself, yet at length he was taken Prisoner by Hippalito a Venetian, and disarmed, as likewise were a great number of his men, and some prime Commanders. In this Battel 2000 foot were slain, as likewise 800 Horsemen, and 700 wound∣ed on the part of the Saxons, but of the Germans the slain exceeded not 500; there were likewise taken 42 Ensigns, with all the Plate, Jewels, Baggage, and Furniture of the Camp, though the Saxons made a kind of a marching or running fight for the space of fifteen miles, in all continuing about eight hours; and after this Victory all the Country of Saxony submitted to the Emperours Pleasure, as soon after did most of the other Estates and Principalities that combined to withstand and oppose him. Thus Saxony in her own Confines prest, Through one great loss is many years distrest, Labring with War till Peace at last gave rest. A Description of the Memorable battel of Muscle-borough-field, fought in Scotland between Edward Seimour Duke of Somerset, and James Hamilton Earl of Arran, Regents of England and Scotland, Anno 1547. A Great difference arising between the two Nations, upon the Scots refusing
(as it had been agreed upon in the days of Henry the Eighth,) to give their young Queen Mary (sole Heiress to the Crown of Scotland) to Edward the Sixth, King of England, &c. The English under the lead∣ing of the Duke of Somerset, and other Nobles entered that Kingdom, resolving by War to prosecute them for their Ob∣stinacy, and oblige them if possible, to the performance of what they (without any Colour or Reason) had refused; whereup∣on on the third of September, Anno 1547, the Lord Regent passed the Tweed with an Army consisting of 10000 foot, of which 600 were Harquibuses, 4000 men at Arms and Demilances, with 2000 light Horse-men, of whom 200 were Harquibusiers mounted, and 1300 Pioneers, the Train of Artillery consisting of fifteen great pieces, besides a Fleet of sixty five Vessels, where∣of a great Gally, and thirty four Ships were well appointed for War, the rest be∣ing Victuallers and Tenders, and on the ninth of September incamped within two Miles of the Scotish Army, under the com∣mand of the Earl of Arran, who the next Morning dislodged, as likewise did the English, and advanced towards each other, though the former had but a bad welcome, for some of the English Ships riding at An∣chor
in the River, let flye so soon as they came within reach of their shot, and killed a Captain, together with twenty five Soul∣diers, which made the Battalion of Ar∣chers commanded by the Earl of Argyle retreat, nor could they be perswaded to advance, which made the whole Army change the intended course by marching more Southwardly, nor stayed they till they had possessed themselves of the Hill called Fauxside-Bray, which made the duke of Somerset, the English General, send some Troops thither to secure the Hill, it being of great advantage to those that possessed it, and so successful was he therein, that he procured in a short time several pieces of Cannon to be mounted thereon, which af∣terward proved very serviceable in batter∣ing the Enemies Ranks, and in the Emer∣gency the Council debated on Horse-back what was to be done, as not having liesure otherways to do it, and came to result this, viz. that the Lord Grey of Wilton, Marshal of the Army, and Captain General of all the Horse-men should with his band of Bulloi∣ners and other Troops, to the number of 1800 Horse-men advance to charge the Enemy in the Front, whilst Sir Ralph Vane and Sir Thomas Darcy, Captains of the Pen∣tioners and Men at Arms, together with
the Lord Fitz-Walter and his band of De∣milances to the number of 1600 should be ready to support him, that so by a furious charge they might break or disorder the thick front of the Enemies Pikes; and al∣though this was a hazardous undertaking, yet the Captains disputed not the Order; [only the Lord Grey desired the General (that if he should miscarry in the Enter∣prize) he would be good to his Wife and Children] and so taking leave, he ad∣vanced to meet the Scots, who with no less speed came on in so thick a Wedge, that it appeared very difficult, if not impossible to pierce their Array, for the Earl of An∣gues, who commanded the Vaunt-guard, had in his Battel 8000 Men, and four or five pieces of Cannon, which served as a flank on his Right, and on his Left he had 400 Horse men, and was supported with 10000 Highlanders, and in the Rear-ward was the Earl of Huntly with 8000 Scots, and 4000 Irish Archers, who served as a Wing unto them both, being furnished likewise with Ordnance, as in the other battel; nor was this all, for the English had the difficul∣ty of a great Slough or miry Ditch to struggle with in their Passage, which not only obliged them to break their Ranks, but mited divers of them that were not
skilled in leaping, yet surmounting these they came to a furious charge, insomuch that although at the first onset the battel was not broken, yet it swaied and gave back to Admiration, so that the English gained Ground apace, but the Lord Marshal find∣ing he was not at that time capable of forcing their Ranks, he made a softly retreat towards the Hill, that they might disrank to follow him, and he thereby have an op∣portunity to give a second charge before they could fall into order, in which re∣treat he lost twenty five of his men, and had divers wounded, many of them Per∣sons of Quality, as the Lord Generals Son, and Sir Thomas Darcy, &c. Nor did they fail to lay hold on the Kings Standard, borne by Sir Andrew Flammock, but it was so well defended, that they only broke the Staff, and carried away the nether end; but the English Commanders having ral∣lied their Troops, and by moving Orati∣ons dissipated the fear the late slaughter occasioned, and being re-inforced, Peter Meucasa, Captain of a Company of Harqui∣busiers on foot, drew up in the front of the Enemies battel, and was seconded by Peter Gamboa a Spanish Captain, who command∣ed 200 Harquibusiers on Horseback, who with their shot made such slaughter, that
the Scots durst not advance, and by that means the English Archers had time to march on the Right-hand of our foot-men, and feather them with their flights of Ar∣rows, and the great Ordnance playing transverse within Musquet-shot, and the foot-men who had been obscured by the Horse, advancing in good array, the Scots began to shrink together, though they were far superior to the English in number, and quickly losing all Courage, betook them∣selves to open flight, their General the Earl of Arran flying foremost, nor did An∣gues stand to it, but followed with great Celerity; so that the rout was by this time in all parts, when as the English crying, they fly, they fly, followed the chace with great slaughter, the miserable Scots casting away their Weapons, and crying out for Mercy, which in the first fury or the pursuit the Souldiers being hot upon Execution, few of them obtained, so that our men using their own broad Swords, (which they had scattered) against them, 13003 of them are reputed to be slain, and of Note the Lord of Loghemworth, the Lord Fleming, the Master of Greym, the Master of Arskin, and of the better fort about 1600, and 1500 were taken Prisoners, the chief of which were the Lord Huntly, Lord
Chancellor of the Kingdom, the Lords of Yester, Hobby, and Hamilton, the Captain of Dun-Bar, the Laird Wimms, and a Brother to the Earl of Casselles. It is further reported, that many perceiving the pursuit grew hot, and that they could not escape it, fell down amongst the slain, and counterfeit∣ing themselves dead, found means when the Pursuers were past, by the shelter of the Night to get into the Woods and adjacent Towns, and so secured themselves from the destroying Swords. As for their Camp, Baggage, Ammunition, and all of that kind, they fell into the Hands of the Eng∣lish, as likewise did many considerable Towns and strong holds, but as for the young Queen, she was before hand con∣veyed secretly into France. The Scots grown obstinate thus dearly pay'd; Because the happy Ʋnion they delay'd, Which Heaven at last, more kind than they, brought on, And made the long contending Nations one. A Description of the Battel of Dreux, fought in Normandy, between Lewis of Burbon, Prince of Conde, and Aeneas Montmoren∣cy, Constable of France, Anno 1562. GReat Troubles arising in France about Religion, soon after the Reformation spread wide in Christendom, amongst o∣thers,
who took up Arms to assert and main∣tain it, was Lewis of Burbon, Prince of Conde, to oppose whom, Aeneas Montmorency drew out the French King's Forces, and hasted into Normandy with all speed; yet not so secretly but that the Prince with whom was Chastillion the Admiral, had notice of his approach, and thereupon consulted with his Associates what was best to be done, who together, all things being weighted, resolved to give the Constable Battel, though the Catholick Army much over∣match'd the Hugonots in number of Foot, consisting of 26000, whereas that of his own was scarce 11000; yet he had the ad∣vantage in Horse by almost a 1000; so that both Armies by this time being en∣camped within sight of each other; the Morning following the Prince drew into the Field and ranged his Battel, pla∣cing his Horse-men, to the number of 4000 in the Vaunt-guard, and himself led the Battel with Rechfocault, taking to him a Squadron of light Horse-men, led by Cou∣rays; and posting on the other side, the Cornets commanded by Monoy and Aveller, with certain Reysters or German Horse, com∣mitting the care of the Vaunt-guard to the Admiral, with whom he joyned the Prince of Porcien, supported by other Troops of
Horse; then followed a battalion of Ger∣man Foot consisting of 4000, supported by 500 loose shot called Enfans Perdus, who, as the occasion requires, are to march before the Battalion as the forlorn hope; then an∣other strong Battalion of 23 Ensigns, con∣sisting of French Foot-men, whose charge it was to manage and guard the Ordnance, being secured in the Flank by a Wing or Party of German Horse; and in this Array he marched with a square Battel. The Constable perceiving the Hugonot Army by the posture it was drawn into, resolved to give Battel, drew out like∣wise, comitting to the Duke of Guise the Right Wing of the Advant-guard, and next in order he placed the Battalion of the Spanish Foot, and the old French Soul∣diers, with four pieces of Canon; of the Left Wing the Marshal of St. Andrews had the Charge, and was guarded on the one side with a Battalion of Foot, and on the other with a Squadron of Horse; and the main Battel principally was composed of 17 Ensigns of French Foot, and 22 Ensigns of Switzers the Constable himself commanded, enclosing 18 pieces of great Ordnance; and thus stood the Battels of the Catholicks in a great length or depth, and the Battels of the Hugonots confronted them, when Con∣de
giving the Signal, and Curay going be∣fore with his light Horse-men, charged upon the Switzers, where he found them left naked of Horse-men, and with great fury broke in amongst them, making a considerable slaughter of them, though they at first, by the help of their Ordnance, made a stout resistance, and the strength of their own Weapons, but the shot fly∣ing thick as hail in their faces, they were soon obliged to give ground, and soon af∣ter not being able to sustain the charge of the Horsemens Launces, they broke their ar∣ray, and scattered, leaving their Ordnance behind them unguarded, whilst those that had routed them ranged with great slaughter through the bloody Attacks; not did the Admiral delay to charge the Con∣stables battel, whilst the Reysters did the like upon Avelle's Horse, who were to sup∣port it, but this beginning of good Suc∣cess and Promise of Victory lasted not long, for though the Constable was wounded and taken in the Charge, his Battel being near over-set, yet Avelle perceiving the Princes foot lest naked, broke in amongst them, and put them far and near to the rout; so that not longer being able to make resistance in the disorder they were in, they fled towards the Village of Blinvil, at
what time the Duke of Guise coming in with a strong reserve, disordered the rest of the foot that yet stood firm, as not ha∣ving been charged, though in entering amongst their Ranks, many of his Horse∣men, together with their Horses, were slain, so that Avelle who kept his Troops firm, being returned from the rout of the foot, and perceiving the Prince's Horse dis∣ordered in pursuit of the Switzers, he broke in, so that the Prince himself was wounded, over-born and taken Prisoner by him, and his Troops put to the flight, which was the only thing that put a stop to Victory's declaring on the part of the Hu∣gonots, and gave the Duke of Guise an Op∣portunity to further his Advantage, yet the Admiral made great resistance, labour∣ing all that in him lay to restore the bat∣tel, in disputing for which the Marshal of St. Andrews was slain, with divers others of Note, and many were wounded; yet the Admiral for want of Horse to second his Foot, was in the end obliged to give ground, yet the fight continued bloody and doubtful, and greater had been the slaughter, had not Night come and parted the Armies, who otherwise, as men reso∣lute, were resolved to have fought it out to the last Extremity.
In the last Encounter (besides the Mar∣shal of St. Andrews) were slain Monbrun, Son to the Constable, the Lord Phinnes, the Grand Prior, and a Brother to the Guise, Guire and Aenabault de' Brosses, with divers others of Noble descent; and amongst the wounded were the Dukes de Ama and Nevers, who soon after died of their Wounds, and many noble Prisoners were taken on either side, neither having cause to boast of any advantage, for the slain computed to ten thousand, were in a man∣ner equally divided; and the battel parted by the Night as aforesaid, the Admiral repaired with his Forces to Orleance, and the Duke of Guise with those that were now under his command, to Paris. Thus Night drew Curtains o're the fatal Field, To spare that Blood which yet remain'd unspill'd; But calm'd not their wild fury, for again Grown big with War, the Captains take the Plain. A Description of the Battel of Bassiack, fought in France between Henry Duke of Anjou, Brother to, and Lieutenant-General for Charls the Ninth, King of France, and Lewis Prince of Conde, General of the Hugonot Army, Anno 1569. ALthough the strengths of either party had been sufficiently tryed, and France
yet reeked with Blood, yet it sufficed not the hot Spirits of the Leaders, but they again drew out their Forces. The Catho∣licks under the leading of the Duke of An∣ou, and the Hugonots under the leading of the Prince of Conde, and the Admiral of Castillion, and after divers Skirmishes the Forces on either part increasing, though not half the Prince's Army were come up, Necessity obliging him to ingage, the fight began with great fury, but lasted not long before Fortune declared against the Hugo∣nots, for the Prince perceiving a great Troop approaching to fight him at disad∣vantage with 4 or 500 Horse, he turned head to charge them, till more of his For∣es might come up, and gave a very hot charge; upon the foremost pressing on with such fury, that he bore down and obliged to retreat all that stood before him; but not being seconded as he ex∣pected, and in hight of his Valour advan∣cing too far, he found himself inclosed by the Ranks of his Enemies, who layed up∣on him so forcibly, that having done all that could be expected from true Valour, he was in the end beaten from his Horse, sore bruised and wounded, where no time∣ly succour coming in, he was constrained to give place unto force; so that being
bidden to yield by de Argence and Monsieur Jean, upon their Promise to spare his Life, he surrendred himself, but soon after being known, Montesquoin, a desperate fellow, contrary to Justice or the Law of Arms, shot him dead with a Pistol: and thus end∣ed the Great and Warlike Conde, who with a handful of men for many years had resisted the power of a potent King∣dom; but here ended not the misery, for his men understanding he was dead, no longer kept the field, but were a great number of them slaughter'd in the pursuit. During the battel, Dacier, the Prince's Lieutenant, and drawn his men, to the number of 6000, out of Cognac, and, adver∣tised that his General was ingaged, hasted by a great march towards Bassiack, but com∣ing within a league of it, he understood by those that fled, that the battel was lost, which caused him to march towards Jar∣nac, but scarcely arrived there before the Catholick Troops appeared, against whom he made head with much bravery, obli∣ging them to recoil in such a manner as gave him Opportunity to make his retreat good with small loss, by passing Rivers, and cutting off Bridges, &c. to hinder the Horse that hung upon his Rear.
The Admiral, and Dandelot his Lieute∣nant, perceiving the fight irreparably lost, and the confusion in all places was great, re∣tired with a small number of the Nobili∣ty, shunning the greater number, the better to hinder the pursuit, and so came to St Jean de Ae'ngly, where being advertised that the young Princes of Navar and Conde were at Zaincles, they marched thither, and made that the place of their Randez∣vouze, whither a great number of such as escaped out of the battel resorted, and soon became a formidable Army, being joyned by those Troops that were not in the battel. In this disaster were slain on the Hugo∣not Party, many of great Note, besides the Prince As de la Tour, Chustebers, Portant, Chandenire, Mesauchere, Brandanire, Besolones, Taberiere, Barette, Lay Mesleray, and about fifty Gentlemen of lesser Note, for the heat of the battel fell upon the Horse, the Foot scarcely coming to ingage, though it went not unbloody on the other part, for a great number of prime Men lost their Lives, especially in the quarter where the Prince charged, yet the Prisoners (Pro∣testants) were many, and amongst them divers of the Scotish Nation, who had en∣gaged themselves as Voluntiers on the
part of the Prince, the chief was Corbeson, Brother to the Earl of Montgomery. As for the whole number of the slain it exceeded not 2000, yet the winning the battel proved of great Importance to the Catholicks, for soon after they over-run Zantougevis, Angue∣mois, Limousin, and other Places of Note, though thereby they gave way to the in∣crease of the Hugonot Power, which ga∣thered to the Standard of Henry, the young Prince of Navar, whom they chose their General, constituting at the same time the Admiral the Protector of his Person; whereupon the War continued as hot as ever, and many great Battels were fought with various success, nor ended it till after the death of Henry the Third. Henry Prince, and afterward King of Navar, was Crowned King of France, as being the next of the blood Royal. Thus France the fate of Civil Discord found, Which in her Bosom made a deadly Wound, War raging through her Confines Terror yields, Encumbring long her blood-bedabl'd Fields, More Red with slaughter, then her Town's with Wine, More Crimson Streams from Wounds, than from the Vine. For still where Native Arms oppress the soil, The Ground's made fat; with Blood the Rivers boil. No Foes at Odds are swell'd with so much Rage, As when two kindred Hoast's fierce battel wage: Nor need we to Pharsalian Plains retreat, Nor fatal Mundas Field's nor Africks beat,
VVhere Roman Civil Hands in slaughter tir'd Could not give Death those Lives their Rage desir'd, Since Native Albion with like Ruine spread, Yet mourns the Blood her mad-brain'd Sons have shead, And drops sad Tears upon the mighty dead. A Description of the famous battel or Sea-fight, commonly called the battel of Lepanto, fought near the Gulph of that Name, be∣tween the Navy of the Christian League, under the Conduct of Don John of Austrian, half Brother to Philip the First, King of Spain, and Haly Bassa Commander in chief for Selimus the Second, Emperour of the Turks, Anno 1572. THE Turks under the Reign of Selimus, the Second of that Name, greatly in∣festing the Seas, and riding triumphant as it were with a powerful Navy on the Ocian; the Christian Princes, especially the King of Spain, the Pope, and the Venetians, began to consider the great damage they had done, and what more they were like to do them, if not curbed in time, which made them con∣derate and hasten out their Ships of War, that they might in Conjunction oppose the growing Mischief, which meeting in the Fair or Bay of Messina on the Coast of Sicily, the Admirals and the other prime Com∣manders
called a Council to consider what course was best to be observed, or what measure to be taken in the management of the War against so powerful an Enemy, en∣eouraging each other with an assured hope of Victory, if they could come to a fair and equal fight: For the Venetians had sent thi∣ther 108 Gallies, six Galliasses, two great Ships of extraordinary force, with divers Galliots and Tenders, to which were joyn∣ed twelve of the Popes Gallies command∣ed by Collumnius, and with Don John of Au∣stria, General for Philip King of Spain, and Auria his Admiral, came 81 Gallies and other Vessels of Force, three of which ap∣pertained to the Knights of Malta, nor were other Princes and States wanting to contri∣bute to this Expedition, viz. The Dukes of Florence, Savoy, and the Estate of Genoa, &c. and in the Fleet, beside Mariners, were 20000 Persons, most of known and appro∣ved Valour, a fifth part being of the No∣bility and Gentry of Spain, Venice, and Rome, &c. all gallantly accoutred and at∣tended, the principal of which were Fran∣ciscus Maria Prince of Ʋrbin, Alexande Farnesius Prince of Parma, and Paulus Jor∣danus Ʋrsianus of the Honourable Family o the Roman Ʋrsini; so that nothing being wanting but an Enemy to contend witha
Venerius the Venetian Admiral in Council pressed the General, that for as much as they were assured that the Turkish Fleet was in the Gulph of Lepanto, speedy Orders might be taken to sail thither, and give them battel with the first advantage, which being agreed upon by all the Commanders, the Fleet was martialed in the following order, viz. In the Right-wing consisting of 53 Gallies, Auria the Spanish Admiral was placed, in the Left wing, with a like number of Gallies. Barbadicus an experienced Commander of the Venetians took his place, and in the mid∣dle the General placed himself with a Squa∣dron of 70 Gallies, Collumnius and Venerius commanding the rest of the Fleet on his Right and Left, and in this Order they set forward with a prosperous Gale. Whilst these Preparations of the Christi∣ans were in hand, the Turks had notice of ll that had passed, and calling a Council n the Bay or Gulph of Lepanto, where they ay, they held a long debate whether they ould give the Christians battel, or decline t, but at length those that were against it eing over powered by the number of Voi∣es of the contrary Opinion, they came to a esult that the Fleet should be put in order o receive them, which at the Command f Haly Bassa, General of the Land Forces,
and great Admiral, was done in this man∣ner so soon as they came out of the Gulf, viz. The middle battel consisting of about 60 Gallies, was to be conducted by Haly Bassa, assisted by Partau Bassa, attended by Agan, Master of the Turks Arsenal; and the rest, in all, to the number of 350 Gallies and Ships of War, were disposed much in the same posture as the Christian Fleet, viz. The Right wing commanded by Ma∣homet Bey, consisting of 50 Gallies, to whom many experienced Sea Captains were joyn∣ed. The Left wing was committed to the charge of Ʋluzales, Vice-Roy of Argiers, an old experienced Pirate, consisting of  Gallies, attended on by Cariolo and Arab his two Sons, and strongly manned with Pirates and Sea Rovers. In the Rearward was placed Amurath Dragut with 30 Gallies attended on by divers small Vessels. And in these Orders both Fleets being arrainged, (though indeed the Turks were deceived in the number of the Christians, by reason the Left wing of their Fleet lay under the Island, and could not be well discerned) the day being fair and calm, about noon they fierce∣ly engaged with such Shouts as made the Ocian Ring, which notwithstanding wa soon exceeded by the thunder of the Can∣nons, nor was God wanting to favour th
Christians by the suddain vering of the Wind, which drove the Smoak of the Ordnance and Vollies of small shot in the faces of the Turks, so that after a long, bloo∣dy and obstinate fight of four hours, the Turkish Admiral being slain, his Gally ta∣ken, and upward of 40 others taken, burnt, and sunk, Victory began to declare on the part of the Christians, but the Turkish Com∣manders fearing the Anger of Selimus if they should return vanquished, fought like men in despair, yet true Valour prevailing, after an obstinate fight of six hours, all the prime Commanders, except Ʋluzales Carragosa be∣ing either slain, wounded, or taken Priso∣ners; and he perceiving the battel irrepara∣bly lost, shifted with his Squadron, and get∣ting clear with about thirty or forty Gallies, fld into the Bay of Lepanto, leaving the rest in flmes, or miserably torn and disabled, to fall into the hands of the Christians, who pursued him as far as with safety they thought convenient, and then return'd to take the Spoil; where it was a dreadful Spe∣ctacle to behold the Sea coloured with Blood, and thousands of dead and dying Bodies floating upon the Waves, together with Masts, Tackle, pieces of Ships, Gallies, and such Weapons as were subject to float; as also the Cries of the wounded, and the
flaming Vessels, which made the Sea seem on a blaze. As for the exact number of the Infidels that perished in this fight, it is not known; but modest Writers, and amongst others, Antenius Gnanaerius in his History of this War, makes mention of no less than 32000, and amongst them these of Note, viz. Haly Bassa General, Mahomet Bey Governour of Alexandria, Cassanes Son to Barbarossa, the Piratical King of Argires, together with his Son Mulaune Governour of Mytilene, Giador Governour of Chis, Cassambeus Governour of Rhodes, Provi Agga, Captain of Naupp∣um, Mustapha Zelibi great Treasurer to the Grand Seignior, Caracoza and others of Note; and amongst those that were taken Priso∣ners, the chiefest of Note were Achmet and Mahomet, Sons to Haly the General, and Nephews to Selymus, and Mechmet Bey Go∣vernour of Eubaea. with 3500 of lesser Note; of the Turkish Gallies 161, as also sixty Gal∣liots and other small Vessels were taken, and upward of forty burnt or sunk during the Fight. This Important Victory to Christendom, which put a stop to the Turkish Incroach∣ment, being intirely gained; Don John, Ve∣nerius and Collumnius, coming on board, the Admiral kindly embrac'd with all the En∣dearments
of Reciprocal Love, and after∣wards in a most Christian Manner, falling on their Knees, ascribed not the Victory to the arm of Flesh, out to him who is the God of Battels, returning hearty Thanks to the great and wise Creator and Disposer of all things, for giving them so signal and important a Victory over the Enemies of his Name, in Imitation of whose pious Example the whole Fleet, as well Souldiers and Mariners, as Of∣ficers and Commanders, did the like. In this bloody and dismal Fight were slain no less than 7566 Christians of all Nations the Principal Persons were John and Barn dinus of the honourable Family of Cordona in Spain, Horatio Caraffa, Ferentes Bisballus, Horatius and Virginius Orsini, Noble Ro∣mans; and of the Venetian Nobility, Agusti∣nus Barbadicus, Benedictus Superantius, Vin∣centius Quirinus, Johanes Lauretanus, Mari∣nus Contarenus, Catharinus Maleperta, Georgi∣us Andreas Barbadious, Marcus Antonius Lan∣dus, Francisous Bonus, Hieronemas Contarenus, Antonius Poscaligus, and Hierom Venerius, all of the Order of the Senators; with many of the Spanish Nobility not mentioned by Name. The wounded of Note, were Venerius the Venetian Admiral, John de Austrae, Paulus Forano the Count de San Fiora Marcus Moli∣ni, Thomasius de Medici, Martello Reverio, Bif∣foli
Marteuno, Guicardini Spina, Mazingi Juli, Maldini Guianovo Magnali, Johanes Marea Pucci, Toraboni Figliazi, Fredricus Eecello, and Gerardo; but not many of them dyed of their Wounds, they being mostly given with Arrows After this Renowned Victory was obtai∣ned, and the account thereof taken, the Ge∣nerals and great Commanders assembled in Council, to consider what was further to be done, and ended in this Determination, viz. That Don John of Austria, with the Spanish Fleet, and Collumnius, (or as some call him) Gollonia, with the Popes Gallies should return to Mesina in Sicily, by reason Winter ap∣proaching, it was no fit Season to besiege any Place of Importance. But Venerius the Venetian Admiral, repairing his Navy, kept the Mediteranean, and won many strong Holds from the Turks, both on the European and Asian shores: and so vexed was Selymus, upon the news of this Defeat, that in a sul∣len Humor he shut himself up for three days, not admitting any to speak with him but those that brought him Necessaries; and then in a Rage, passed a bloody Decree, to Massacre all the Christians in his Dominions, which had been wickedly put in Execution, had not the Grand Visier laid many Rea∣sons before him to divert him from it; nor
have the Turks to this Day repaired the Loss, but remain inconsiderable to what they for∣merly were at Sea, saying, That God has di∣vided the World by giving to the Christians the Sea. and to the Turks the Land. Turkish Hist. in the Life of Selymus the Second. Thus were the Proud Insulting Turks subdu'd, Who had so many Lands with Slaughter strew'd, Whilst Grecian shoars beheld the woful Wrack, And trembl'd at so great a Ruin's crack. Toe Sea too Blush'd with an unwonted stain, Shrinking to see her self the shambles of the slain. A Relation of the Battel of St. Quintines, fought in France, between Aeneas Montmo∣rency, High Constable of France, and Gene∣ral for Henry the Second French King, and Philbert Duke of Savoy, Lieutenant-Gene∣ral for Philip King of Spain, Anno 1577. THE War being proclaimed between France and Spain, Philbert Duke of Savoy, with an Army of 13000 Horse, an 40000 Foot, and 8000 Pioneers, laid Siege to the Important Town of St. Quintines in Vermandois, to the Relief of which, the French King sent Montmorency High Constable of France, with an Army consisting of 4000 Horse, and 20000 Foot, with all the flower
of the French Nobility, who served as Vo∣lunteers in this Enterprize, and with him he drew a Train of twenty pieces of Ordnance; when being come within fifteen Miles of the Place, he detached 2000 Horse, causing them to advance and find out the Foard o the River, which they must pass about three Miles on this side the Town, which they accordingly did, but found it so narrow, that only six Horse a Breast could pass it; not was it abandoned bnt defended on the other Bank by a Regiment of Spanish Harquibusi∣ers, who upon the approach of the gross of the French Army were reinforced with some Troops of Horse, who kept their station notwithstanding the Canon plaid against them with great Fury; but it was not long e'r the Duke of Savoy understanding the French Army was much Inferior to his in number; calling a Council, it was after some Debate resolved therein, that the French should not give themselves the trouble o passing the River as they intended, and for that purpose were laving over Bridges: But that leaving a sufficient number to block up the Town, the rest of the Army should im∣mediately pass over and give them Battel, whereupon Count Egmont was commanded to lead the way with a 1000 Horse, Burgun∣dians and Spaniards, seconded by Ernes
and Ericus Dukes of Brunswick with 2500 Horse, after whom followed Count Mans∣field with 800 Dragoons, and Count Horne with a 1000 Men at Arms, seconded by a 1000 Horse, detach'd from divers Troops; and in this manner they forced the Passage without much Resistance, and ranged them∣selves in Battel array, for Montmorency rather desiring to put a Supply into the Town, than come to a Battel, only kept them busie with light Skirmishes, whilst the Parties he had appointed for that purpose passed the River at greater Distances; nor did he alto∣gether fail herein, for 300 resolute French∣men did enter: but finding the gross of the Spanish Army press upon him, he by little and little began to retire towards the Hills, Skirmishing in the mean time to retard their March, especially with the Light house, who sought to delay him till the gross of the Ar∣my came up: But finding in the end that his Retreat might prove disadvantageous to him, as not having any means of escaping a Battel, if the Spanish General would oblige him to it, he put his Army in Array, resol∣ving to try the Fortune of War; which he had scarce done before the Count of Egmont gave a furious Charge upon the advanced Parties of French Horse, and being second∣ed by the Dukes of Brunswick, Count Home,
Count Mansfield, and Collonel Horckstrate, after a sharp dispute, wherein the French be∣hav'd themselves with much Resolution and Bravery; fresh Troops of Spanish Horse still coming in, and much slaughter made, Mont∣morency was obliged to suffer his Horse men to Retreat to the Body of Foot, who casting themselves close together in a thick Squa∣dron, stood firm, and strongly sustained the Charge, making it a bloody and doubtful Fight, which the Duke of Savoy perceiving, poured in fresh Troops to prevent the retreat of those that were almost wearied out, com∣manding Count Egmont to renue the Charge upon the Foot men with greater fury, send∣ing other Troops at the same time to charge the Horse, that they might not have leisure to put themselves into Array; so that the French-men continually having fresh Forces to contend withall, overpowred with num∣ber, and wearied, especially the Horsemen, betook themselves to flight, abandoning the Foot to the mercy of the Enemy, so that a great slaughter ensued, the Fight being main∣tained in a flying manner over the Plains, so that on the part of the French there were slain to the number of 6000, and of note John Duke of Anguen, Brother to the King of Navar, Vicecount Touraine Nephew to the Constable, the Lords Campodenary, Eyrrie,
Galan, Plenot and Gelot, with many others, the Horse consisting mostly of Nobility, the wounded were about 2000, and of note Montmorency Constable of France, the Dukes of Longeville and Montpensire, the Marshal of St. Andrews, Lewis Brother to the Duke of Mantua, Vasey, Courtain, and Roche du Maine, the Rhinegrave, the Count Rochfocault, the Lords Obigney, the two Birons, Montbrun and Merne, and about 4000 taken Prisoners, with all the Bagage and Ammunition, whilst on the part of the Spaniards not above 1000 were slain, the chief being the Sieur Binecourt, Master de Camp, and two Noblemen of Germany, Count Mansfield was wounded in the thigh, and Count Monbrey in the knee. After this Battel the strong Town of St. Quintines fell into the hands of the Spaniard, as likewise did Haron and Chastellet, they ranging freely in those parts for that Sum∣mer without any interruption.

A Relation of the great Sea-fight, fought off the Coast of England, between the English and Spaniards in the year 1588. vulgarly called the fight of the Spanish Invasion. KIng Philip of Spain fretting in his mind at the prosperous success of Elizabeth Queen of England, both abroad and at home, and more especially resenting her assisting the Flemings, in their Wars held against him in the Low-Countries, as also the depredations made by Sir Francis Drake, and others in the West-Indias, he at the Instigation of Pope Sixtus V. and some English Fugitives pre∣pared a great Navy to Invade England, for whose vastness and seeming strength, it was named by the Spaniards the Invincible Ar∣mado, though in the sequel it proved other∣wise. This great Fleet at its setting out con∣sisted of 130 Galleoons, Gallies-men of War and Tenders containing 57808 Tuns, where in were 8405 Marriners, 19295 Souldiers, or Landmen, and 2088 Gally-slaves furnished with 220000 great shot, 4200 Kintas of Powder, 1000 Kintals of Lead for small bullets, 1200 Kintals of Match, 7000 Mus∣quets, and 10000 Halberts with Partisam, Field-Pieces, and other Provisions requisite for such an undertaking, of which the Duke
of Medina Sidona was Admiral, and was to be joyned by the Prince of Parma, Gover∣nour of Flanders, and to be supplied with further necessaries, which accordingly he provided and prepared in all parts of those Provinces, upon notice of which and the other preparations, the Queen whom they thought by reason of the close carrying on of their design to surprize, unprovided for so important a defence, caused her Navy Royal immediately to be fitted out, under the command of Charles Lord Howard of Effingham, whom she constituted Lord Ad∣miral, and Sir Francis Drake Vice-Admiral, with a Squadron was dispatched to the West of England, there to cruze and ob∣serve the motion of the Enemies Fleet, whilst Henry Lord Seymour second Son to the Duke of Somerset stood with Forty Sail to the Coast of Flanders, to prevent Parma's joyning with Medina, and there∣upon mustered an Army of Land-Forces, consisting of 10000 Horse and 32000 Foot, with part of which she not only Encamped at Tilbury in Essex, but with the rest secured the Places that seemed to Render the Ene∣my the easiest Access of Landing, though through many distresses and disappoint∣ments the Spaniards had met withall, it was confidently reported and believed by
some that they could not in any convenient time make their intended attempt or enter∣prize, yet contrary to the expectation of the English, they on the 11. of July cast Anchor in the Chanel, and from thence sent a Dis∣patch to Parma in the King's name, to joyn his Forces with them, and send such neces∣saries as were convenient to further the Ex∣pedition, but on the 20th. following about noon, being discried by the English, they hasted out of the Harbours, and on the 21. of the same instant, viz. the Lord Ad∣miral Howard, Drake, Hawkins and Forbi∣sher, the most expert in Maritime Affairs, that Europe then afforded, played furiously in the Rear of the Enemy, who were drawn up in the form of a half Moon, and so bat∣tered Rechalde who commanded a Gally of great force, that he (his Squadron being put to the worst) was so disabled, that he had fell into their hands had he not been Re∣ceived shatter'd as he was into the middle of the Armado, as likewise was the Ca∣tharine of Spain, a Ship of great burthen, although the Spanish Admiral declined fight∣ing as much as was possible, bulwarking the smaller Vessels with those of greater force, bearing from the Coast of England towards Calais, so that a great Ship of Bis∣cay, commanded by Don Oquendo, being
fired on the 22. of June, a great Gally com∣manded by Pedro Valdez fell into the hands of Sir Francis Drake, in which beside the Commander Don Pedro de Valdez, were Vas∣ques de Sylvas and Alanzo de Saijs, and other Noblemen, the whole number of Men on Board, according to their own computation being 430, which were made Prisoners and disposed of in divers places, till they were afterward Ransomed, nor fared the Vice Admiral De Oquendo better, for his Ship having received great damage by fire, she was taken with much treasure and carried into Plymouth, and although hitherto it had been a kind of a moving Fight, the Spani∣ards shewing an unwillingness to Ingage before they Received their Succours and supply from the Prince of Parma, who was indeed blocked up at the same time by the Hollanders, who stood upon their guard on the Coast, yet now the English Admiral pressed their towring Castles with his shot so furiously, that many of them were mise∣rably rent and torn, with small damage to the English, for that the Spaniards being high built could not well bear their Ca∣non upon the English Ships, whose hulls were much lower, and when at any time they did, the Commanders with their nimble Ships shifted and tacked to a better
and more commodious station of anoying the Enemy, and so incessantly the Batteries were made, that nothing was heard but the thundring of the Canons, and the cries of Men, whilst ascending smoke made dark the Skies. But the Lord Admiral not think∣ing it convenient to graple with such strength, who had a strong Army on board. After he had taken and sunk Twelve of their Ships and Gallies, and killed them above 5000 men whilst they lay at Anchor before Calais, in vain expecting the Prince of Parma: A stratagem was found out to break and disperse them, which took more effectually than what had before been put in practice, viz. into Eight of the oldest and least serviceable English Vessels were put Pitch, Tarr, Rosin, Hemp, Flax, and other combustible matter, their Guns charged and rammed higher than usual with stones, crossbar-shot, pieces of Iron, and the like, when in the Night time the wind standing fair, they were sent amongst the thick Squa∣drons of the Spaniards under the Conduct of two expert Sea-Captains, viz. Mr. Young, and Mr. Prowess, with a command to fire them so soon as they were within Musquet-shot of the Enemy, and let them drive, which by Trains lay'd for that purpose, they accordingly did with such an unex∣pected
thunder-crack, as made the Ocean tremble, and so amazed the Spaniards with the unexpected approach of these flaming messengers, which bore directly upon them, that seting up a dismal cry from all parts, they cut their Halsers and Cables, as not having time to weigh Anchor, and scatter∣ed in great confusion to avoid being fired, and such was the consternation, that run∣ing fowl upon each other, great damage ensued, and yet greater, for by reason of the nearness of the shore, divers run upon the shallows and Sands, where some of them were taken by the French as wrecks, others by the Hollanders and Flushingers, and some fell into the hands of the English, who still pursued them with the perpetual thundring of their Canon, and from that time de∣prived them of Calais Road, so that find∣ing themselves in a bad case, and no hopes of Relief from Parma, who being blocked up, could not possibly come forth, a Coun∣cil was called to determine what was fur∣ther to be done, to prevent the danger that threatned them, and after many debates, it was Resolved, that seeing the Prince of Parma had failed them, and they not in a condition to continue long in these Seas, without a supply of Provision, and other necessaries, they should immediately return
to Spain by the Northern Passage, as not imagining the English would follow them that way, yet were they not a little deceived, for the Admiral doubting they might land in Scotland, chased them to the Coast of Norway, and there left them to more serious Councils, not without much indamaging them with his shot, as he hung on their Rear by the way. The Spaniards being now freed from pur∣suit, had time to consider their loss, which they found to be very great, and not to be Repaired in those Parts, and especially wanting water, they were obliged to throw most of their Mules and Horses over Board to save that little they had, and steering towards Spain, sail'd about the Cathanes, and the Coast of Ireland even to 61 degrees North Latitude, which extraordinary change of Air disagreeing with the constitution of the Spanish bodies, many of them died by the way, and so passing between the Orca∣des and the Islands of Fare, the Duke of Medina with the best Gallies and Ships stood away to the Westward for Spain, leaving the rest to follow as they were able, where at his arrival he was deposed from all his Places of Authority and trust, forbid the Court, and commanded to Retire and live private; as for the Ships he left to
follow him, they many of them fell in with the Coast of Ireland, and being unskilful in those Seas, were cast away upon Rocks, and shallows, and some were by the force of the Current driven into the Channel, and taken by the English, but miserable was their condition, who fell into the hands of the Irish, who for the most part put them to the Sword, for the Plunder they found about them, others were taken by the Ro∣chelers, and some driven into New-Haven in Normandy, so that of 134 Sail that set out of the Bay or Port of Lisbon, only 53 returned into Spain; of the four Galleasses of Naples but one, of the four Gallioons of Portugal but one, of the 91 Gallioons from divers Provinces but 33, so that in this Expedition 81 of their Vessels, together with 13500 Souldiers and Seamen perished, many of the slain being Persons of the first Rank and of great Quality, the Prisoners of note were Don Pedro de Valdez, Don Vasques de Sylva, Don Alanzo de Saijs, Don Alanzo de Luzon, Roderigo de Lesse, and Don Diego Piementelli, nor was there a Noble Family in Spain in this Expedition, the charge of which is almost incredible, but lost a Son, a Brother, or Kinsman.

Thus, thus, to frustrate what proud Spain design'd, The Rocks, the Fire, the Seas, the Shores, the Wind, VVith English Arms and Courage all combin'd, Ambition sinks, in vain is Mortal might, VVhen 'gainst it an Immortal Power does fight, To vindicate the wrong'd, and do 'em Right. Nor has Spain yet Retrieved what there it lost, But wants those Millions that Armado cost. A Relation of the Battel of Nimbre de Dios, fought between Captain Drake and the Spa∣niards in America, on the 28 of July, 1572. SIR Francis Drake being upon the disco∣very in the West Indias, and understand∣ing from the Natives by what cruelty and oppression the Spaniards had gathered great Treasure in those Parts, he resolved to put in with them for a share, and thereupon sailed to Nimbre de Dios, a Sea-coast Town, where a great part of the Spanish Treasure lay, and in the Night time came on shore, seising upon six Pieces of Ordnance, those that guarded them being fled to Alarum the Town, when leaving a sufficient num∣ber of men to make a safe Retreat, if occa∣sion required it, he with great Resolution and bravery stormed the Town on the East-side behind the Treasure-house, not∣withstanding the opposition the Spaniards
made, and with Bea of Drum and Sound of Trumpet forced his way to the Market place, whilst the Souldiers that were there in guard, as likewise the Inhabitants put themselves in Arms, making shew (to ter∣rifie the English) of a greater force, by hang∣ing lighted Matches on Lines athwart the Streets between the Churches and the Cros∣ses, but that stratagem being discovered, they fled upon the first Charge, yet the Souldiers rallying came to push of Pike, and the But-ends of their Musquets, so that a sharp Fight on all hands ensued; but Drake encouraging his Men, and fu∣riously pressing on, the Spaniards at last throwing away their Weapons, betook themselves to flight, whose scattered Wea∣pons in the chace woundéd many of the English, which obliged them to Return to the Market-place with the Prisoners they had taken, and being shewed by them the King's Treasure-house, they perceived in it through the Grates or Iron-wickets, by the help of a Torch, a Pile of Silver-bars about seventeen foot in length, ten in breadth, and twelve in height, and were given further to understand, that in an other Treasury near the Water-side, there was much Gold, and very many Jewels, but Drake doubt∣ing that whilst they were busie in lading
them away, a greater number of Spaniards might set upon his Men, resolved to keep guard till the Morning, but some of the Souldiers, by reason of the excessive storm that then happened, murmuring at the de∣lay, he to satisfie them, said, though to the loss of any thing that might happen, see∣ing he had brought them to the mouth of the Treasury of the World, he would be no hindrance of their making themselves Master of it, and so when the storm was over, unwilling to give them any longer leisure to demur, he immediately advan∣ced, commanding part of his men under the leading of his Brother John Drake and John Oxnam, to break the King's Treasury, whilst the Rest with himself in Arms sup∣ported them; and certainly they had pos∣sessed themselves of a vast booty, had not an unhappy Accident fallen out, viz. All things being now in a readiness for the Attack: as Renowned Drake advanced to this great Enterprize, his Men perceived him to faint, and to their unspeakable sorrow found the cause to proceed from the great effusion of bloud that had issued from his Leg, woun∣ded with an Arrow, and filled the prints of his foot-steps, the which though it much pained him he concealed, till his Men dis∣covered it, as loath to dismay them, well
knowing they would not suffer him to pe∣rish, and if they forsook their station to carry him on board, they could not at that time regain it, and so it happened, for although they would have hazarded much for such a booty, yet they thought their Captain's life of greater moment that both the Indias, so that having refre∣shed him a little with some Cordials, and bound up his Leg as well as the Juncture would permit, they intreated him to go on board, but finding him unwilling to remove, rather choosing to hazard his life than retire from so great an advantage, they, partly by intreaties and partly by force, constrained him to Embarque, and so for the safety of their Captain were content to forgoe a treasure of inestimable value, yet in the Harbour they took a Ship richly laden with Wines and other Commodities; in this undertaking of the English few were lost, but of the Spaniards near 100 killed and wounded; and though he sped not in this place, yet sailing in those new discovered Parts of the World, he took may. Towns and sundry Rich Prizes, returning victorious with much Treasure and Applause. Thus Drake Renown'd, the second Neptune stil'd, In their new world th'insulting Spaniards foil'd,
And in wide Tracts discovers unknown Stars, Whilst England's Fame to both the Poles he bears, Views what e'er Phoebus sees in his vast round, And Lands unnumber'd, then unknown he found Wild Nations him Adoring as a God, Whilst he in Triumph on the Ocean rode; Their Crowns and Scepters yielding to his hands, Whose Name yet fair in Fames large Record stands. A Description of the Memorable Battel fough between Hasan Bassa General for Amurath the Third of that Name, Emperour of the Turks, and the Confederate Princes of the Empire. A Murath, the Third of that Name Emperour of the Turks, having ob∣tained a small Victory over the Persian Sul∣tan, and growing proud of his acquirement restless and impatient of Peace, called hi Bassas to consult what War was most con∣venient to be undertaken the succeeding Spring, amongst whom were eight dif∣ferent Opinions, whereof the first was to re new the War against the Persians, the se∣cond to Invade the Kingdom of Fess an Morocco, the third to War upon Spain, th fourth to besiege Malta, the fifth to Wa upon the Venetians, the sixth against Sigi∣mund King of Poland, the seventh to In∣vade
the Territories of Rodolphus the Ger∣man Emperour, all which, together with the several Reasons moving thereto, be∣ing patiently heard by Amurath, the last was approved, so that resolving to turn his Arms on Hungary, &c. he raised huge Forces in all his Dominions, as longing for the remaining part of that Kingdom, and the Principality of Austria, wherefore, the better to be at leisure, he concluded a Peace with the Persian Sophy, ordering his Garrisons on the Frontiers to prosecute thoir Advantages with Fire and Sword, which they improving, seized upon Willitz the Metropolis of Croatia, and committed therein many outrages, and still increasing in power, they suddenly and unexpectedly inclosed 6000 Foot and 500 Horse of the Christian Forces that had taken the Woods Mountains and straight Passages, and cu them almost all in pieces, loading with their heads six Waggons, which sudden Eruption so Alarmed the Christian Prin∣tes, that they incontinently raised a great Power to put a stop to the progress of the infidels, who had by that time taken ma∣ny Towns, Castles and strong Holds; and est Amurath should alledge that these un∣expected Hostilities were committed with∣out his knowledge, the Emperour Rodol∣phus
sent an Ambassadour to Constantinople to understand the reason why without any cause he had broken the League, but not being able that way to get any satisfactory answer, he prepared more vigorously for War, causing his Forces to joyn with those already raised by the Electoral Prin∣ces, &c. under the command of Rupertus Eggenbert his General, who upon the ap∣proach of the Enemy consulted with his Chief Commanders what was best to be done, and they being all of opinion that it was best speedily to give Battel, thereby to prevent their joyning such other Forces as were advancing to their Aid, it was Re∣solved that the Army, consisting of 40000 horse & root, should immediately advance, which they did with much celerity in good Array, yet not so secretly but the Turkish Commanders had notice of it, and put themselves in order to receive them and so confident were they of obtaining the Victory, that they dreamt of nothing but the spoil of the Christians, whom they already concluded overthrown, by reason of the disproportion of number, they be∣ing indeed much inferiour in number  the Infidels, yet had the Imperial General so ordered his Battel, that placing th Hussars and Croats in the Van-guard
those of Carolslad and the Harquibusiers of Serina in the left Wing, in the right the Borderers of Carrania, all Horsemen, and in the main Battel the rest of the Soldiers with the Horse-men of Silesia, under the command of Sigismund Paradiser, the Reer∣ward was incompassed or guarded with three Companies of Switzers; nor were the Turks less diligent in Marshalling their battel, placing their best Footmen in the front, and extending their Wing of horse to great advantage. Thus things being in a readiness on ei∣ther part, the Charge was sounded, where∣upon the Croats and Hussars in the Vaunt-Guard gave the first onset with such fury, that being seconded by the Lord Aremsberg, they after a cruel fight broke through the Squadrons of the Turks main battel, with their huge Swords making fearful slaugh∣er and wide desolation, insomuch that the stoutest gave way, nor could Hassan Bassa their General, with threats and pro∣mises, Restrain it, but still shrinking toge∣ther in fearful manner, and both the Wings broken by the Imperial horse, who fell upon them with a tempest of shot, by which a great number of them were over∣whelmed: this great Army consisting of 80000 horse and foot, fell into rout and
confusion in less than three hours space, and although Hasan Bassa indeavoured to make an orderly retreat, yet he could no do it, for the Christians following furi∣ously, and charging upon those that fled raised in them such a fear to prevent the Sword that urged them behind, that in ha∣stily passing the River Odder, a great number of them were strangled in the Waters, and those that stay'd in a fearful manne on the banks to search for the foards, were most of them miserably slain, so that those who remained disranked and sough every where to save themselves, by which means the slaughter was scattered over a the field, and had been very great ha not the approach of Night put an end to it yet there perished by the Sword, &c. 18000 besides a great number that perished in the River, and amongst the slain Hasan Bass the General, Mahomet Beg, Achmet Beg, Suf∣fer Beg, Meni Beg, Framulan Beg, Curlii Beg Operd Beg and Goschus Bassa, together with Sinan Beg, Amurath's Nephew, the only So of his Sister: As for the Prisoners taken they were many, yet few of note, though the spoil of the Camp was very great. The Battel thus happily obtained, the Christi∣ans, as well the Commanders as the Soldi∣ers, fell on their knees and gave immortal
thanks to the God of Battels, to whom alone they ascribed their success. The News of this overthrow coming to the Knowledge of Amurath, he highly ra∣ged, and at the Instigation of his Sister, who refused to be comforted for the loss of her Son, sent a blasphemous denuntiation of War, stiling himself there in Monarch of the World, and a Mighty God on Earth, &c. Thus those that sought for Blood, with Blood were pay'd, And meeting Death, their cruel fury stay'd, Who had with Flame whole Realms in Ashes lay'd. A Description of the famous Battel of Lutzen, fought on the sixth day of November, An∣no 1632. between Gustavus Adolphus, the Warlike King of Sweden, and Duke Walenstine, Generalissimo of the Imperi∣al Army. THE King of Sweden having entered the Empire with an Army, and over∣thrown Count Tilly, the Imperial General with incredible slaughter, the Terror of his Name spread wide, which caused ma∣ny Towns and strong holds to be at his Devotion, nor was it expected but that every where being victorious, he would in a short time make himself Master of the
Empire, though to oppose him Walenstine Duke of Frizland was made Generalissimo, and another huge Army raised, which the King, upon notice of their being at Lutzen, resolved to attack, and therefore in the most secret manner marching all Night, he came within sight of them in the Morning, and drew up into battel in this manner, viz. He divided this Army into two fronts, and each of these into the Wings and bat∣tel, with their Reserves, each of the Wings composed of six Regiments of Horse, lined with five bodies of command∣ed Musquiteers, every one of them ad∣vancing with two Field-pieces in their front, which plaied continually on the Imperialists. The battel in each front con∣sisting of four Brigades of foot, a reserve of foot being placed between the two middle Brigades of the first front, and a reserve of Horse hindermost of all between the two middle Brigades of the rear or second front, and before each Brigade marched six pieces of great Ordnance, which the King himself (who would ever be in pla∣ces of greatest danger) led, committing the lest to Duke Bernard of Saxon Weymar, and the main body to Dodo Kniphausen, Ser∣jeant-Major, and General of the whole
Army, under whom commanded many experienced Collonels and Captains, &c. of sundry Nations. The order of the Imperial Army was in this manner, viz. It being drawn into one large front, was divided into three bodies, the Right Wing of Horse which tended to the town of Lutzen, was com∣mitted to the Count Rodolpho Coloredo, ap∣pointed for that day Serjeant-Major-Ge∣neral of the Army, and was lined with commanded Musquiteers, besides support∣ed by others that were lodged in the Gar∣dens, and had likewise the advantage of certain Windmils standing upon small Hills, whereon they planted nine pieces of Ordnance, the Mills and Millers Houses serving them for a good shelter, the main battel or middleward was commanded by the Generalissimo's station, being in the head of the Regiment of Piccollommine's, consisting of Horse, which was placed in the middle of the foot Regiments, the left wing pla∣ced opposite to the right, was commanded by Collonel Henderick Holek, lately made Lieutenant velt Marshal under velt Mar∣shal Lupenheirne, yet no longer than till the other who was absent should take the field. Both Armies being ordered in battel array, and the advantages of the Ground
which was in a manner a plain Campain, unless some few ditches that proved trou∣blesome, being taken by either General as well as the time and opportunity would permit, as likewise those of the Wind and Sun, which in this case is ever observed by great Captains to be no small advantage to those whom they favour. The fight began with the thundering of the great Ordnance, by which many were over∣thrown on either side, but the eager Soul∣diers desired to come to a close fight, so that advancing hastily towards each other, after the small pieces that were in the head of the Musquiteers on the Kings part were fired, they gave their Salvos, upon which the Horse that supported them charged furiously upon the German Horse, so that many were slain, and a great number beaten down, who were most of them troden under foot, and the King having commanded Collonel Stolhaunsh a Fleming, to charge the Cuirassiers, who were all in black Armour, himself advanced at the head of the right Wing, with his Pistol in one hand, and his Sword in the other; and when he had fired his Pistols, regard∣ed not to recharge them, but charged up∣on the Enemy with his Sword so furiously, that although they fired thick upon him,
and flashes were even in his Face, he de∣sisted not till he had broke their Array; yet a Regiment of Croats taking the Ad∣vantage of the Kings being hotly ingaged, thrust between the Right Wing and the main battel, in order to seize upon the Baggage, and blow up the Powder, but Collonel Bulach making head against them, they were obliged to retire; yet upon his wheeling about to recover his station, they fell on his Rear, and much disordered that squadron of Swedish Horse, but a sudden Mist falling, it was not perceived by the rest of the Imperialists. And now the fight being hot on all parts, and the King out of the greatness of his heat and Cthge still pressing on, and entering amongst the Ranks of those Iron-men (as he called the Cuirassiers) being himself only clad in a buss Coat, and not being well supported, he was overlayed with numbers, for his men being in danger to be hemmed in by the Cuirassiers and the Regiment of Picolmaini, which came fresh to charge them, were obliged to give ground and retire towards their own bodies to prevent the danger they foresaw; so that the King being left open to the shot of the Enemy, received a shot in his left Arm by a Musquet-bullet, which in the heat of his Courage he at first sliove¦ed,
but perceiving the blood gush out a∣bundantly, and that the bone was splin∣tered, he thought fit to give way to ne∣cessity, and thereupon calling to the Duke of Saxen Luenberg who charged with a par∣ty on his right; Couzen, says he, I am surely wounded, help me to make my retreat, the which whilst the Duke la∣boured to do, the Squadron at the head of which the King charged being put to the retreat, an Officer of the Cuirasiers knowing the King broke desperately thro' the Ranks that sheltered him, and com∣ing behind him as he was Retreating, sh  through the Body with his Pistol,  at the same time, this is the right bird, yet enjoyed it not, for scarce had he done it before himself was shot dead on the place, by Luchan the Master of the Dukes horse, and so lost his expected Re∣ward, yet so hotly the Cuirasiers charged, that the Swedes were not capable of bring∣ing off the dying King, but were obliged to let him fall, where he was barbarously mangled by the Enemy, who stripped him, every one getting something that could conveniently come at him, as a Trophy of honour, all that he was heard to say, as those report who were about him, when thas demanded who he was, for at first
those that stripped him did not certainly know him, was, viz. I am the King of Sweden, who do Seal the Religion and Li∣berty of the German Nation with my bloud, and then after some hesitation sub∣joyning, Alas, my poor Queen, and so re∣commending his Soul to God, gave up the Ghost, yet was his Body after ward Rescu∣ed and honourably buried, his death be∣ing lamented even by his Enemies: and although the King was thus slain, yet he was a Conquerour even in death, for the Swedes, instead of being discouraged, grew more inraged, and breathing nothing but revenge for the death of their King, char∣ged so furiously on all parts, that although resh Supplies came hourly to the assistance of the Imperialists, yet after nine hours ob∣stinate fight, not only their right Wing but their main battel was broken and dis∣ordered, which obliged the Generalissimo, under the favour of the Night to draw off, yet in such confusion, that most part of his Souldiers, fearing the pursuit of the Swedish horse, disranked and fled, leaving their Cannon, and a great part of their Baggage behind them, together with their wounded men, and 6000 dead upon the place, many of them of great Note, when on the Swedes part there died not above
2000. the chief of Note on the part of the Imperialists were the Abot of Fulden, by his place a Prince of the Empire, the Counts Puppenheim and Bartholdus, Walen∣stine's Serjeant, Major General Bruner, Lodo∣vicus Westrum, Lancius Comargo, Witzeb and Fines, all Collonels of the respective Regi∣ments, together with Borda Taxheim, Lam∣part and Cammarhoff, Lieutenant Collonels, besides divers Serjeant Majors, Captains and Lieutenants; and on the Kings side, of Note was himself, Nicholas Count of Wesenburg, Grave Nelees, Serjeant General Isler, and Collonel Gersdorf, with some Lieutenant Collonels, and divers Cap∣tains. Thus great Gustavus fell, yet conquering dy'd, Fortune ne'er gave the battel from his side, VVhere'er he fought be was victorious still His body only Fate had powr to kill. A Brief Description of the memorable Battels and Skirmishes, &c. that happened during the un∣happy civil Wars in England, &c. in the Reign of King Charles the First, as they are taken and drawn from warrantable history, &c. AFter many Indignities had been put upon King Charles the First, of blessed Memory, by an inexorable Parliament,
whom no favours nor concessions could oblige, he thought it highly convenient to oppose their force with force, and there∣upon in August 1642. he set up his Stan∣dard at Nottingham, so that the Hostilities being begun, after the loss of about twenty men by a Sally out of Hull, and the rout∣ing of Collonel Fines and Sands, by Prince Rupert at Worcester, with cōnsiderable slaughter of their men, &c. The King resolved to march towards London, but finding the Earl of Essex, who by this time was made General for the Parliament mar∣ched after him, and hung in a manner upon his Rear, he faced about to give him battel, or oblige him to retire, so that the Armies facing each other, and the King having discovered the number of the Re∣bels from a convenient stand with a Pro∣spective, and desiring God and all good men to assist his cause, on the 13 of October 1642. he drew into a large Field or Plain, between Edghill and Keinton, in the County of Warwick, where Essex was putting his Army in order, so that both Armies being drawn up in battel array, the Charge was sounded, and thereupon a dreadful fight began, continuing bloudy and doubtful, Prince Rupert, who there commanded the King's horse, making a great slaughter,
and pursuing the Enemies horse even be∣yond their Baggage, so that they forsook the field, but fresh Troops coming in, the fight-was maintained with doubtful success till Night put an end to the fury, yet the King soon after had many Places surren∣dred to him, and marched triumphantly into Oxford with 150 Colours there taken, and in this battel are computed to be slain between 5 and 6000 men on both sides. And now the King's Army being Re∣cruited, and increased by the coming in of many Troops, and the Revolt of two Re∣giments, and a Troop of Horse from the Parliament, upon his taking of Banbury, he marched towards London, whither Essex was retired, upon which Essex with an Army composed mostly of Prentices, and the City Trained Bands, drew out to oppose his passage, which made the King advance to gain the Bridge, to prevent his being hemm'd in, by reason the Parliaments for∣ces possessed most of the Towns in those parts, but part of Hollis's Regiment made head against him, & being seconded by two other Regiments, the Passage was hotly disputed, which lasted till Night, at what time the Parlimentarians retreated, and left the Town to the Ksng, together with 200 of their men dead upon the place, eleven
Colours and fifteen Pieces of Ordnance, but he slighting that place, returned to Oxford with his Army: nor was the King's success in other Parts less, for in February following, Prince Rupert with a select Par∣ty of 4000 horse and foot, making shew to Regain Hadly Castle, a little before ta∣ken by Collonel Massey, marched imme∣diately to Cirencester, and charging the Guard, forced his way into the Town, with considerable slaughter, possessing it in two hours dispute, with all the Maga∣zine of the County, and 2000 Arms, ma∣king at the same time 1100 persons Pri∣soners, yet this Joy was somewhat lessen∣ed, by the Defeat of 1500 Welch-men, raised by the Earl of Worcester and his Son, for the service of the King at Hingham house, by the Forces under the command of Collonel Massey and Sir William Waller; as for the rest of the Year 1642. it was passed over in sundry light Skirmishes, sometimes successful to one Party, and sometimes to the other, the most material of which was, that in Hoptón-Field near Hautly in Staffordshire, where the Earl of Northampton was slain, and that of Bram∣ham Moor, wherein Sir Thomas Fairfax was routed. In April 1643, young Hautham the Son
of Sir John Hautham, whose Father had de∣nied the King entrance into Hull, was rout∣ed by Collonel Cavendish near Ancaser in Lincolnshire, and most of his party slain or taken Prisoners, and a hot skirmish hap∣ned between the Kings party and Essex's men near Causum Bridge, wherein the for∣mer was worsted and obliged to rett with some loss; and in May divers s∣mishes with various success hapned in the West between Sir Ralph Hopton, who com∣manded there for the King, and Sir Geo. Chudleige for the Parliament, though the former for the most part had the advan∣tage; nor did Hostilities cease in other parts, for in June divers skirmishes hapned between Prince Rupert and Essex, the most material of which was in Chalgrave-field in Oxford-shire, where the Prince furiously charging a body of the Parliament Horse, routed it, killing and wounding a great part of the Enemy, and amongst the latter John Hambden, who soon after dyed of his Wound, as did some others; and on the fifth of July Sir Ralph Hopton with a few Forces of the Kings under his Command, engaged Sir William Waller, who had double his number, maintaining the fight from two in the Afternoon, till about one the next Morning, whereupon Waller percei∣ving
him resolved to obtain the Victory or dye in the place, left the field, yet soon after, being ashamed of the retreat. he fol∣lowed Sir Ralph to the Devises in Wilt-shire, whither he was marched with a Resoluti∣on to set upon him, of which the King having notice, sent 1500 Horse from Ox∣ford, (where he lay encamped) to his as∣sistance; but upon the Comjunction, Waller not thinking it convenient to try the event in that place, drew off to Roundway-down, but being hotly charged he was in a short time broken and disordered, whereupon with his Horse he fled in great Confusion, leaving his foot to the mercy of the Royallists, who were most of them slain in the fight, or taken Prisoners, together with four pieces of Cannon, all the Amunition and Bag∣gage, nine Cornets, and 28 foot Colours, so that by this fatal blow given on the 13th of July, Waller having lost his Army, most of the Horse deserting him in his flight, he hasted to London with the lamentable story of his defeat. Essex by this time with a powerful Ar∣my having relieved Glocester, and surpri∣zed a Convoy of the Kings, which fell in∣to his hands through mistake, marched to Newberry, where the King remained as yet with his Army, and had prepared to re∣ceive
him in the best order the short time of notice would give leave or opportunity; so that on the 20th of September 1643, both Armies confronting each other the charge was immediately sounded, and seconded by the thundring of the Cannon, and Vol∣lies of small shot on either side, whilst Prince Rupert with his Squadron forced the main battel, and put it into great dis∣order, but whilst he pursued his good for∣tune, he found himself charged by two squadrons of Horse that descended from the Hill, where till now they had been posted, so that the fight was doubtful and bloody on all parts, it being in many places brought to the Sword; so that the Lord Jermin, who commanded there a Regiment of horse for the King, being over charged by number, was obliged to force his way (not without great hazard) through the Batta∣lions of foot, yet was the fight maintained with considerable slaughter on either part, till Night put an end to the fury, both Armies keeping the field till the next day, and then retired from each other as by con∣sent. The Persons of Note slain were the Earls of Carnarvan and Sunderland, the Lord Viscount Faulkland, and in all on both sides, near six thousand.
In March, Sir Thomas Fairfax and Mitton were set upon by Prince Rupert at Drayton in Shropshire, and routed; as likewise was Sir John Meldrum, who had entred England with his Scotch Forces, in favour of the Par∣liament, forced to leave Newark which they had besieged, with the loss of their Canon, Ammunition, and all their Baggage, which was Relieved by Prince Rupert, and only permitted to depart with their Lives: But now Sir William Waller having gotten an∣other Army, Anno 1644, fell upon the Lord Hopton's Forces near Winchester at un∣awares, and over-pow'ring him in num∣ber, cut off divers of his men, and obliged him to leave the field, whereupon Win∣chester surrendred, but Waller was soon after overthrown by the King's forces at Crop-ready Bridg, and Essex with the gross of the Parliament Army blocked up in Cornwall; and now the Earl of Newcastle being besieged in York, Prince Rupert ad∣vanced with an Army of Horse and Foot to Relieve the City, upon whose approach the Besiegers drew off, and were upon their retreat hotly pressed and charged by a Sally from the Town, when the Garrison, under the command of the Earl, joyning with the Prince, they with conjunct Forces followed the Parliament forces to a place
called Marston-Moor, where both Armies drew up, and with great sury joyned bat∣tel, which continuing with much effusion of bloud for the space of four hours, vi∣ctory in the end declared against the Roy∣alists, and in this fight, called by many the bloudy fight of Marston-Moor, 9000 men on both sides are computed to be slain, af∣ter which battel York surrendred, and al∣most all the Towns in the North, so that for a while, nothing but Skirmishes hap∣pened: But on the 27 of October both Ar∣mies meeting a second time near Newbury, an obstinate fight ensued, but the Roya∣lists having done all that could be expect∣ed from true valour, and still oppressed with fresh numbers of the Enemy, were forced in the end to give way to necessity, and leave the field in some disorder; nor is it guessed that on both sides less than 4500 were slain, after which nothing more happened in England this year, but the skir∣mishing of Parties, and taking of Towns and Castles; but in Scotland the Marquess of Montross with inconsiderable forces, rai∣sed by virtue of a Commission from the King, routed divers Armies of the Cove∣nanters, putting all Scotland in fear of being Reduced to its obedience by his Prowess.
Anno 1645, Essex having laid down his Commission, it was taken up by Sir Tho∣mas Fairfax, and Cromwel was made Lieu∣tenant General, most of the prime Offi∣cers of the Army being changed, yet the King's party strugled strongly for the Royal cause, though many finding things in a manner desperate, had retired from the Army, and passed the Seas, for be∣sides divers skirmishes, Collonel Massey in April, was routed by Prince Rupert at Lidbury with considerable loss: But in June following, the King's forces were defeated at Langport, where about 200 were slain, and 1400 taken Prisoners, which occasi∣oned soon after the surrender of Pomfret, Scarborough, Bath and Bridgwater; yet in August the Parliaments Quarters, with some slaughter on both parts, were beaten up about Tame, and the Scots defeated at Kiel∣sieth in Scotland by Montross; and in Sep∣tember, Montross was defeated at Phillipphaugh in the said Kingdom, and the King's for∣ces in England were Routed on Routon heath near Chester: and in October the Lord Digby was likewise defeated at Sherborn in the County of York; and in March follow∣ing, the Lord Ashley was defeated near Stow, and Dening surrendred to the Par∣liament; yet the great blow that caused the
Royal Cause so much to decline, was the unfortunate battel of Naseby, fought near the Town of that name, and so, as it was the saddest, I shall conclude, with the de∣scription of it, this unfortunate War. The Armies meeting near Naseby, and the King in a Council of War resolving to give battel to Fairfax, who had for some time followed him in the Rear, he so or∣dered it, that himself commanded the main Body, and Prince Rupert, assisted by his brother Prince Maurice, the right Wing, and the Lest was committed to Sir Mar∣maduke Langdale, there were likewise two Reserves, the one commanded by the Earl of Lindsey and the Lord Ashley, and the other by the Lord Bards and Sir George Lisle; of the Rebels Army Fairfax and Skippon commanded the main Body, the Right Wing was committed to Cromwell and Collonel Rossiter, and the left to Ire∣ton, there were in the Army likewise two Reserves, under the charge of Collonel Pride, Rainsborrough and Hammond. The Armies being in array, the Charge was sounded, whereupon Prince Rupert ad∣vanced with great Resolution, charging the Left Wing commanded by Ireton, which after some Resistance was forced to give ground, in this conflict Ireton was wounded
in the face and thigh, and had his Horse shot under him, and was taken Prisoner, so that the Prince pursuing this advantage, fol∣lowed the chace even to the Town of Nase∣by, and upon his return summoned the Bag∣gage and Artillery to surrender, but with∣out success in the main, for by reason of the Prince his not timely returning to the battel, Cromwel had the best opportunity to charge the King's Left Wing, which he did with such fury, that he soon broke and disorder∣ed it, whereupon that Wing fled, leaving the main battel (wherein was the Person of the King) open and unguarded in either flank, so-that the Reserves not being able to make it good, and Cromwel returning with his victorious party before the Prince, charging in the flank, whilst the battel of the Enemy did the like in the Front, not∣withstanding the great Resistance that was made, the King's battel of Footmen became broken and disordered; so that although it came to handy-strokes, with much Resolu∣tion and obstinacy on either part, yet fresh Supplies of the Parliament foot coming in, and the Royal-Army, considering the safety of the King, who was pressed on all parts, finding it self unable to make longer resist∣ance, retreated out of the Field, as the Prince was advancing, who perceiving the bad for∣tune
of the King's Army since his absence, and despairing to restore the battel, retired likewise; Fairfax pursuing the King till within two miles of Leicester, though in the way a Retreating-fight was maintained on the part of the Royalists, so that the King not thinking himself safe in Leicester, mar∣ched without staying directly to Litch∣field. In this Fight about twenty Collonels and Officers of lesser note, together with 600 common Souldiers were slain of the King's Party, and many wounded, amongst whom of note, the Earl of Lindsey, Lord Ashby, Col∣lonel Rastol, &c. but almost all the Foot, to∣gether with their Officers, were taken Pri∣soners, and in all six Collonels, eight Lieu∣tenant Collonels, eighteen Majors, seventy Captains, 4500 private Soldiers, 200 Ensigns, one of the King's Coaches, with part of his Treasure, and almost all the Waggons, Am∣munition and Baggage, together with his Letters and Furniture, with twelve Pieces of Ordnance, 8000 Arms, and the KING's Standard, which quite broke the strength o the Royalists, insomuch that they could no bring any formidable Army into the field afterward: nor was it long before the King being besieged in Oxford, made His escap thence, and cast himself upon the Scotch
Army, who for a Summ of Money deliver∣ed Him up to the Parliament, whose usage towards Him was so Inhumane, that it can∣not be mentioned without a deep sence of sorrow by any good Christian. Wherefore in silence let us mourn His fate, Who dy'd a Martyr for the Church and State. A Brief Description of the second Battel of Worcester, fought on the Fatal Third of September, Anno 1651. KIng Charles the Second, of blessed me∣mory, being crowned at Scone in Scot∣land, entred England with an Army, for the Recovery of his Right, in August 1651 and by easy Marches, with little difficulty, en∣tered Worcester on the 22 of August, being Joyfully received by the Town's men, who were glad of that opportunity to Return to their Allegiance, and there it was solemnly debated, whether he should stay there, and expect the event, or immediately march to London, but in the end the former was con∣cluded, at least so long till the Soldiers had well Refreshed themselves, which gave the Enemy advantage to gather about that City from all parts, yet care was taken for fortify∣ing the place, and securing the advantageous
Passages, to which purpose a Line, and se∣veral Mounts were raised, yet Major-Gene∣ral Lambert, who commanded for the Par∣liament, sending suddenly a Party of Horse to discover the difficulty of the passage at Ʋpton, where Major General Massey com∣manded 300 Horse and Dragoons for the King, about fifty of them venturéd over on a piece of Timber, accidentally left cross that part of the Bridge that was broken down, and although the Royal party im∣mediately took the alarum, and beat them into a Church, where they defended them∣selves, yet so speedy was Lambert in sending over a greater number of men, that after a hot dispute, Massey having his Horse killed under him, and himself shot through the Arm, was obliged to Retreat; and now Cromwell's Army that had followed the King in the Rear out of Scotland, began to joyn with those Parties that were already gather∣ed out of divers Counties, making in all between, 50 and 60000 Men, when as the King's whole Power exceeded not above 10000, so that with these numerous Forces, he was in a manner encompassed, and there being no hopes left of marching away with∣out coming to a battel, after divers Sallies with various success, the fatal day drew nigh, for Cromwell, Fleetwood, and others, after
the gaining the pass at Ʋpton, endeavoured to make themselves a clear passage to the City, that their Army might joyn in the Leaguer, to which end two Bridges were ordered to be made, the one over the Se∣vern, and the other over Thame, over the last of which Fleetwood advanced, to attaque the City on the West part, which so Ala∣rum'd the Royal Army that then lay within their Leaguer at St. Jones, that to hinder the approach, they sallied out with the greatest part of the Horse and Foot, so that a hot dis∣pute ensued, till overpowred by number, more than by true valour, they were obliged to Retire again into their Lea∣guer; But whilst this encounter was on the West side, Cromwell passed his Army over Severn, and marched directly towards the Wall, which the King perceiving, sallied at the head of the Horse, and charged with so much courage and bravery, that Cromwell's own Guard, and the best of his old Soldiers were forced to Retire, whilst seconded by those numerous Supplies of fresh Soldiers, who served like the Turkish Asapi, to blunt the Royal Swords, so that their wearied Arms, no longer able to hold out, they were forced to Retreat, notwithstanding the Ge∣nerous Example of the King, who perfor∣med things worthy of wonder, executing
at once the part of a brave Commander, and a valiant Captain, in which he had his Horse twice shot under him, yet could he not bring them to rally, for being pres∣sed and overpowred by numbers, they had not time or space to do it in; so that in the end the retreat turned into a disorderly flight, whilst the Enemy following close at their heels, entred Pell mel with them into the City. And now notwithstanding the flight and confusion, the cry went through the field to save the King, who although he was pres∣sed by Duke Hamilton and others, to reserve his fortune to a better day, yet scarcely could he be induced to quit the field, nor would he till he perceived it impossible to rally his men, and too plainly found the battel was irreparably lost, and that Cromwel had en∣tred and possessed himself of a part of the City, and soon after took the Fort Royal by assault, putting all he found therein to the Sword, but not without considerable loss, especially of the Cheshire men, 1600 of which fell in the attempt; and now when it was almost too late, the King left the field, and by the Aid of divers Loyal Souls, after a con∣siderable while concealing himself, found means to escape beyond the Seas.
In this fatal battel, fought on the third of September, most of the Kings foot were ei∣ther killed or taken Prisoners, but of the Horse about three thousand escaped out of the Field; those that account the least, recon 3000 that were slain, though none of note amongst them, and the chief of the Priso∣ners were the Earls of Derby, Lauderdale, Cleveland, Shrewsbury, and the Lord Went∣worth; and of the Scots the Earls of Cran∣worth and Kelly, and the Lord Sincler, with divers Knights and Gentlemen, and soon after Duke Hamilton and Major General Massey and others were taken. This strange and wonderful Victory, as the Juncto then sitting at Westminster, gave it out, though they had ten to one in the field, made the Sectarian party greatly re∣joyce, and to appoint publick days of Thanksgiving, as if God were the Patroni∣zer of Villanies. But since they miss'd of what was most their Aim, We won't their further wicked Acts proclaim, Lest by such Monsters we the Nation shame.
A Description of the Great and Memorable Battel, fought before the City of Vienna in Austria, on the 11. of September, Anno 1683. between the King of Poland, the Ele∣ctor of Bavaria, the Duke of Lorain, &c. and the Grand Visier Cara Mustapha, &c. VIENNA, being pressed by the Turkish Power, and the Garrison therein un∣der Ernestus Count of Staremberg, greatly weakned by sickness, and the loss sustained in divers Sallies; the Duke of Lorain having joyned the King of Poland, they thought not convenient any longer to hazard a place of such Importance, but to attempt the Re∣lieving of it, at the Price of a Battel, and so on the 10 of September, 1683. about eight in the Evening the Armies marched, in or∣der to it, making together between 70 and 80000 fighting men, the King of Poland commanding the Right Wing, the Dukes of Lorain and Bavaria the Left, and the Elector of Saxony and Prince Waldeck the main Body; and in this order, with what speed and silence they could, they marched through a great Forrest, the which had the Enemy taken care to have fortified, would have proved a work of much difficulty; Cara Mustapha, the Grand Visier, trusting
to his number of men, expected not to be attaqued in his Camp, he being at his sit∣ting down before the place 120000 strong, but finding himself mistaken, he thought it best to Rouse out of that Security, and upon the Approach of the Christian Army detached 10000 Horse, with an express com∣mand to possess themselves of the Passes, &c. but the Christians before that had passed them, yet they advanced to Charge the Front of the Army, but being gauled by a Regiment of Foot lodged in a Vineyard for that purpose, which was supported by three other Battalions, they only fired and wheeled off with great Cries, whereupon the King of Poland, and the other Comman∣ders drew the Army up in three Lines, all closed without any Interval, and in that firmness they encroached upon the Enemy, at what time the Turkish Horse advanced with great shouts, hoping to break the Ar∣ray of the Battel, but perceiving the Chri∣stians stood firm to expect them, they made a halt, and discharging their Harquibusses at a distance wheeled off, whereupon the first Line fired upon them, and the whole Army advanced by a slow March, still gaining upon the Infidels, and making of them a considerable slaughter, who Re∣turning charged as before at a convenient
distance, and so wheeled off, continuing often to do the like, and as often the Chri∣stians fired upon them, and so proceeded till within two Furlongs of their Camp, at what time a Body of Foot and Dragoons were detached to Attaque their Canon, of which they soon became Masters, without any considerable loss, the Enemy wanting Foot in a readiness to defend them; nor did their Horse make any great resistance, yet they made a shew to charge the Right wing in the Flank, to prevent which, the King of Poland commanded the second Line, to advance and make a Front on that side, whilst in Person he charged their Front with the first Line, making them continu∣ally to give ground, and whilst the Fight was hot on both sides, the Turks in the Trenches made a furious Assault upon the City, strugling even at the utmost hazard to carry it; and so resolute they were in throwing themselves into the Ditches and Breach, that great slaughter ensued, which obliged Count Steremberg, the Governour, to send with all speed to the Duke of Lorain for assistance, least the Turks at that juncture should enter, and mix the ruine of the Ci∣tizens and Garrison-Soldiers with their own, when immediately the Margrave of Baden was detached with 5000 Horse and 3000
Dragoons, who entering the Trenches at the time the Garrison sally'd, the Turks that were in them were cut in pieces, and trod∣den down on all hands to the number of 6000, which unexpected bad success made known to the Visier, and finding that now his hopes were altogether frustrated of en∣tering the City; in the time of the confu∣sion, he gave ground towards the Even∣ing with the Gross of his Army, in hopes to make an orderly retreat to the Camp, but being furiously charged by the Christians, he fled beyond it, yet the Generals suspecting they might Rally and fall upon them un∣der the favour of the Night, would not en∣ter the Camp by reason it might be a means to separate and scatter the Army, but stood in Battalia till the next Morning, at what time they perceived the Visier was retired in great confusion with all the Horse, lea∣ving the Foot behind him, to the number of 25000, who defended themselves in the Camp for a time, but the King of Poland entering furiously on the one side, and the Duke of Lorain and Elector of Bavaria breaking in on the other, for want of their Horse they could make but small Resi∣stance, for their Array being soon broken by the violent Charge of the Polish Horse, and overwhelmed with a Tempest of shot;
they were almost all of them killed or ta∣ken Prisoners, which gave the Polish Horse an unexpected opportunity to pursue the Visier, which they did with such success, that they cut off a great part of his Rear, and took very much of his Baggage, but fearing to separate themselves far from the Gross of the Army, least falling into an Ambush, the Turks might Rally and charge them, they were content to Return with what Booty they had gotten. In the Camp were found fifty Pieces of Canon, two Horses Tailes, the Grand Vi∣sier's Standard, a great Summ of Money, a little before sent thither to pay the Army, ogether with many Rich Jewels, and the Letters of divers of the discontented Hunga∣rian Nobility, wherein they pressed the Vi∣sier to besiege the City, promising him all the Assistance they were capable of contri∣buting towards his taking of it by storm or capitulation: The Visier's Horse was like∣wise taken, with his Pavilion, and all the Tents, Baggage, and most of the Provision and Forrage. In this battel, fought on the 11. of Sep∣tember, the Turks lost between 20 and 0000 men, and their loss in the Siege be∣fore this time, not being computed less than 20000, besides such as dyed of the bloody
Flux, and other diseases, and amongst the slain were divers Bassa's and Zanzacks of Provinces, and some of note taken Prison∣ers, though the loss of the Christians, in con∣sideration of so signal a Victory obtained over the Infidels was but little, viz. about 1000 slain, and as many wounded in the Action, the Chief of the former being the Count Trotmandorfe, and a Brother of the Duke of Croy, who advancing too far upon the Quarters of the Janizaries, were killed with Harquibus shot, but the loss of the Besieged was very considerable, for of 15000 fighting men which were in the City at the beginning, not above 5000 Remained, and those so weak by sickness and wounds, that they began to despair of holding out a∣gainst another vigorous Attaque. And thus was this great City Relieved and Rescued (in a manner) out of the hands of the Infi∣dels, who received such a blow in this De feat, as has ever since curbed their Towring Ambition, and for which miscarriage, as it was imputed to the Grand Visier, he lost his Head, being first strangled with a Bow∣string, by the Order of the Grand Seignior, and soon after followed another overthrow, which was given the Turks near Barkan, viz. on the ninth of October, wherein 9000 were computed to be slain and taken Priso∣ners;
and of the Poles and Germans not above 600, whereupon the Fortress of Bar∣kan capitulated, and was put into the hands of the Duke of Lorrain for the use of the Emperour Leopold the First, &c. And soon after that, upon the retreat of the Visier to Belgrade, sitting down with a part of the Army before Gran, antiently called Strigo∣nium, and having beaten the Turks from an Eminence upon the River where they had fortified themselves, he had the place sur∣rendred after a furious Battery and many Assaults, the Garrison capitulating to march out with as much baggage as they could carry to Buda or Newheusel, and since that both Newheusel and Buda are reduced to their Obedience, &c. both taken by storm, the former on the nineteenth of August, An∣no 1685, and the latter on the second of September, Anno 1686. And thus the tot'ring Ott'man state smks low, That late to all the World did dreadful show; Thus God, in whose Eternal Thoughts are shut The Fate of Empires, when he'l please to do't, Can humble haughty man, and make him know That on him does depend all things below.
The Great and Memorable Battel of Alcazar, fought in Africa on the Plains of Temista, between Don Sebastian, King of Portugal, and Mulei Moluc King of Morocco; in which perished three Kings, with all the Flower of Portugal. DON Sabastian King of Portugal, being young, and of an Heroick Spirit, de∣sirous to win Fame, cast in his Mind many things how and by what means he might accomplish some enterprize that might eclips the Glory of his Ancestors; and first he proposed to widen by a new Conquest his Territories in the East-Indias, where the Por∣tugals had many strong holds, but considering the way too long for the subsistance of so great a Fleet as he must carry with him, he in the end concluded to invade Africa, where he held several Frontire Towns, under pre∣text of re-establishing Mulei Mahomet, who had fled to him for succour, as having been a little before expulsed his Kingdom by Mulei Moluc, his Kinsman, and so with a gallant Fleet, and an Army of between 18 and 20000 men, Portugals and Strangers, he set out of the Bay of Lisbone on the 25th of June, 1578, and coasting along the shore,
obtained a fair Wind, by the favour of which in a few days he arrived at Almadra∣ves, a Town between Tangier and Arzil, and having visited his Garrison, and furnished it with all things necessary, he landed his Forces somewhat nearer to Alarach, to fur∣nish them with Water, of which they were in great distress; and after divers Councils resolved to march into the firm Land of Africa, whilst Mulei Moluc was making great Preparations to oppose him, and withal sent to offer the King of Portugal ten Miles of Country lying round his Fortress of Tangier, if he would withdraw his Army; but the King returned answer that he would not quit the Enterprize, unless he would put Tituan Alarache and Cape D' Aghero into his Possession; but this seeming to the Moor too excessive a demand, he sent back word that he must consider of it although the siege was before Morocco, and so drawing forth his Ar∣my, consisting of about 60000 men, most Horse, he advanced towards the Portugals, who had entred by easie Marches the main Land as far as the River Mucazan without any other Interruption than a light skirmish, and were by this time increased by some Troops of Moors that came and submitted to Mulei Mahomet, besides a small number of Andeluzians that guard the frontiers, so that
the Army consisted (beside those that were left to guard the Fleet) of 13000 foot, and 1600 Horse, not reckoning the Moors, who made not above six or seven hundred, viz. Ten thousand Portugals, three thousand Germans, a thousand Spaniards, and six hundred Italians. The Army of Moluc consisted of 3000 Moors of Andalouzia, as well Horse as Foot, under the conduct of Doali Algori and Osain, who had passed into Africa from the Wars of Alpussares, he had also 3000 foot, and 25000 Horse, with 1000 Harquibusiers on Horseback, the most part of them Rhenega∣dos and Turks; and although these were the chief strength on which he rely'd, yet over and above he had about 10000 Horse, and 5000 foot raised in haste, besides a great number of Arabians. And in this case Mo∣luc kept to himself the Title of Generalissimo, and gave the Title of General of the Horse to his Brother Hamet, protesting to strangle him with his own hands if he was found guilty of Cowardise, he made likewise Osa∣in Collonel of the Harquibusiers on Horse∣back, Mahomet Faba of the Rhenegados, and Musa Captain of his Guard. During the approach of the Moors, in this manner the King of Portugal divided his Ar∣my in three squadrons, almost united toge∣ther,
that the one might the better succour the other; that in the front being divided in a manner into three divisions, for in the midst the Adventurers were commanded by Alvaro Pirez, Brother and Lieutenant to Christopher D' Tavora; on the left hand were the Castilians led by Alphonso D' Agui∣lar, lined with Harquibusiers of the same Nation, commanded by Lewis d' Godoji, and the Germans on the left hand under the command of the Lord Tamberg, mingled with Italian Harquibusiers, and the Portugals of Tangier under the command of Captain Hercules Pisa, every Nation being put in ranks with their Commanders in the front. In the squadron that seconded this were the Portugals, under the command of Michael d' Norogna and Vasco d' Sylveria flanked with Harquibusiers, and in the other which ser∣ved for the Rearward, were the Portugals under the command of Diego Lopez de Sequei∣ra, and Francis de Tavora. For the Guard, of whom two wings of shot were formed, in the Rearward were likewise 300 Harqui∣busiers, and on both sides of the Army the Horse was placed in the form of Triangles. The Right Wing commanded by George d' Alancastro Duke of Avero; on the left was the Standard Royal Jean de Sylva the Spanish Kings Ambassador, and Theodose Duke of
Barcaellos, eldest Son to the Duke of Bragance, on the Right hand, a little separated from these were about 200 called Africans, which live on the Frontiers, and near them the Moors of Mahomet, and in this order they marched with their Baggage in the midst between their Horse and Foot on the Right Wing, on both sides leaving a space be∣tween their Squadrons, to Retire, if need required it. The Disposition of the Moorish Army fur∣ther than what has been mentioned, was as followeth, viz. The Footmen who were all Harquibusiers, were placed in the form of a Crescent or half Moon, the first Rank being Andalusians, the second Rhenegadoes, and the third Africans, so distinguished from others, for their living on the Borders upon the two Horns of the Crescent, he placed two Squadrons, in each 10000 horse, and behind towards the Rearward, at equal distance, followed the rest of the horse, in small Troops, with a design to extend and encompass the Portugal Army; but whilst this was doing, Moluc the Moorish King fell exceeding sick of a disease that had long af∣flcted him, yet put forth his strength to the utmost, to give necessary orders in all places, and having encouraged his Souldiers with a moving Oration to do their utmost
for the preservation of themselves, and the safety of their Country, he retired into the main Body where his Litter stood, as like∣wise his Guard and his Standard. Whilst these things passed, the Christians approached, and in the Plains of Tamista both Armies confronted each other, when by the command of Moluc, whose sickness extreamly increased, the Moorish Horsemen extending the horns of their Crescent, joyned them at the back of the Christian Army invironing the whole Camp in the form of an Oval circle, and then began to straiten it, by drawing in their Ranks closer and firmer, whilst their Footmen stood in the Front to oppose any further passage that way, when as the Canon from the Moorish Army began to play, but without any great Damage; nor had the Christians upon the discharge of their Canon much better success, but the Portugals being somewhat dismayed upon the second fire, the King to prevent their further consternation of that kind, gave the signal of Battel, where∣at the Squadrons of the Advantguard, and of the Horse moved with wonderful force and valour, the Footmen encountering the Moors with great fury, so that a bloody and doubtful Fight began, yet coming to hand strokes, the Moors were thrice broken and
put to flight with the loss of their Colours, but fresh Troops being frequently sent to fill up the Gaps their Sword had made, they wearied the Christians with slaughter. In the Rearward Francis de Tavora with the Regiment of Sequiera was hotly charged, where he made a stout Resistance, killing many with his own hand, those in the middle were the last that engaged, but Mo∣luc gave them no long time to consider e're he sent a Squadron of Horse to ingage Vasco de Sylveire and Michale de Norogna on either side, so that now the Fight grew hot on all parts, but these latter made weaker resistance than the rest, many of them throwing away their Arms, and falling on their knees yiel∣ded at discretion, most of whose Heads the Moors cleft in sunder with their Scymiters, they not being as yet at leisure to take Pri∣soners: And now the Circles of the Moorish Horse and the Squadrons that were behind move furiously, and charged the Avant∣guard, where the Italians and Castilians had cut in pieces a great number of their best men, so that the Christian Army being close∣ly begirt and presled on all sides, the Soldi∣ers grew fearful, especially the Portugals, who began to loose their order, by shrink∣ing together, whilst on the other hand the Enemies orders were open, insomuch that
they could approach without any disorder of their own, nor could the King with all his Labour and Diligence prevent it, though no Expression nor Action of Bravery was wanting in him to set them an Example of true Valour; and much worse had been their Estate, had not the Portugal Horse (accustomed to live on the Frontiers with the Moors) of King Mahomet, and the Duke of Avero with his Triangle timely charged those Troops that were hasting to break in upon, and disorder the foot, and put them to the rout; but this happy success lasted not long, for whilst the Duke, who commanded the greatest number, fought hand to hand, he discovered a squadron of Horse approaching to charge him, who being far superior to him in number, he durst not abide it, but fol∣lowed the chace of those that fled, designing to return to the fight with greater advan∣tage, as indeed he did, for turning his Horse he charged those that came to incoun∣ter him, but being overpowred by ods of number, and pressing violently by the Ene∣my, he could find no place of retreat amongst the squadrons, but rushing through the Ranks of the Germans, some part of the Horse entring amongst the foot, created no small confusion on the other side of the Ar∣my, where yet the Standard Royal remain∣ed;
the Troops of Horse there placed made great slaughter of the Moors, pursuing them even to their Artillery; but being succoured by the squadrons that were sent to support them, they returned afresh to the fight, so that in a short time it fell out worse with these Horse than those commanded by the Duke, the King not being there, but gone to the Vaunt-guard, for being home charged by the Moors, they sell in amongst and greatly disordered their own foot, so that both Horse and Foot being in disorder, and no place of retreat left, flight and Confusi∣on ensued, for although this part of the Horse consisted most of Nobility and Gen∣try, yet many of them being young men sent by their Friends to wait upon the King, and little expecting to come to so sharp a Conflict, were raw and unexperienced in the Trains of War, so that whilst some were fighting valiantly, others even in the same Troop were flying, unpursued of the Enemy; yet where the Italians and Spaniards fought, the King being then in the Vaunt-guard a looker on, great resi∣stance was made, insomuch that above 2000 Moors were killed in the place; but not being succoured, they were in the end overcome, rather weary with killing hand to hand, than by the force or Valour of
the Enemy who pressed them with their Multitude; yet the first charge of the Afri∣can Horse of the Portugal Army, command∣ed by Edward de Menesses, struck no small terror to Moluc, for seeing his men fly, (sick as he was) he left his Litter, and mounting on Horsback (notwithstanding the Chri∣stians shot approached) he in a great Chol∣ler advanced to restrain their flight or dye in the place; but being seized with a fit of his Disease, in the midst of his fury he sunk from his Horse into the Arms of his Favo∣rites, who came about him to perswade him to return; and being carried to his Litter, he there instantly dyed; yet was his Death kept secret by the Rhenegados that attended him, lest upon the bruit thereof the Moors should leave the Field, and consequently the Victory to the Portugals, which no doubt they would have done, had they at that time known it; and although the Por∣tugals had notice of it some hours afterwards by several Rhenegados that deserted the Moo∣rish Camp, and it was published to incou∣rage them to maintain the fight; yet it pro∣ved too late. for by this time the greatest part of the Army was in Confusion, losing continually ground, and shrinking toge∣ther, notwithstanding the squadrons of the main battel did not move, but unfurnished
of shot, stood lookers on, urging it was the Kings command, till charged by the Moors on Horseback, they most of them miserably perished, their Commanders in that Consternation not being able to draw thm into any proper Posture of resi∣stance or defence: and now Francis de Ta∣vora having long by his Valour withstood the Moorish charge of Horse and Foot, was slain by a Harquibus shot, whereupon his men were so discouraged, that many of them threw down their Arms and fled; and soon after the Duke D' Avero having rallyed some Troops of Horse, and char∣ged desperately upon the Moorish squadron that attempted to force the Ranks of the Germans, had his battel overborn, and was himself unhorsed and slain; and on the other side were Christopher de Tavora and Alphonso de Norogna, with divers others of account slain. And the Arabian Adventurers (who came rather to spoil the conquered than to fight, having a little before fallen upon the Moors Baggage when they sup∣posed they were in the rout) with a full carreer charging the foot that stood firm brake their Ranks, and put them into great Confusion, so that Victory now de∣claring against the Christians in favour of the Moors, and the chief Commanders being
unhorsed, and their Magazin blown up by an accidental fire, nothing but flight and slaughter ensued, though the King, with some of his trusty Friends about him, endeavoured by Words and Example of true Valour to restrain them, and restore the Battel, though in vain; for after he had acted the part of a valiant Souldier, killing many of the Enemies with his own hand, and having three Horses slain un∣der him, in vain being required to yield, he expired, fighting couragiously on the heaps of the slain, after which every one shifted for himself. King Mulei Mahomet escaped out of the battel, but hastily at∣tempting to pass the River Mucazan, now swelled by the Moons increase, he was there drowned, as were many hundreds who were deceived in the Foards, the Ri∣ver being swelled to a greater height than when they passed it; so that as the Plain were covered with the slain, the River was no less pregnant with the floting Car∣casses of those that were drowned therein. The battel thus intirely won by the Moors, Hamet hasted to his Brother Moluc Tent to rejoyce with him for the succes of his Arms, but finding him dead, and it being further made known, himself by the general consent of the Captains and
Souldery, was in the Field saluted King, and many Presents made him of the rich Plunder found in the Christian Camp, as also of sundry noble Prisoners, amongst whom of chiefest Note were, Anthony Prior of Crato, and the young Duke of Barsellos: nor was the day less famous for the Death of three Kings, viz. Don Sebastian King of Portugal, Mulei Moluc King of Morocco, and Mulei Mahomet the cherif or expulsed King, and by the imprisonment of the greatest part of the vanquished Nobility of a Realm, and so many Souldiers, the Pri∣soners being more than the slain; for of all that landed, not above one hundred returned to the Fleet to tell the News; and though the number of the slain on either side is uncertain, yet next to the Kings mentioned, there fell of the Chri∣stian Nobility, the Duke of Avero, Alphons Earl of Vimiosa, Lewis Contingo Earl of Rodondo, Vasco d' Gama Earl of Vidignera, Alphons de Norogna Earl of Mira, John Lobo Barron of Alvito, Alvara de Mello Son to the Marquess of Ferrara, Rhocterick de Me∣llo Son to the Earl Tentugvel, Jamie Bro∣ther to the Duke of Bragance, John de Syl∣veria Son to the Earl of Sorteglia, Christopher de Tavora, the Lord Tomberg, Arias de Syl∣va Bishop of Conionbra, with many others
of account; so that some Noble Families by this means were quite extinct, and sew in the Kingdom of Portugal but had a Son, Brother, Nephew, or some other Relation that fell in this unfortunate battel, sought the fourth of August, Anno 1578. Portugal Hist. Lib. 2. The Christian Arms thus Fate in Asrick crush'd. In Royal Deaths her killing fury blush'd, Whilst Crimson Streans from mixtures of the slain. Manur'd with Blood Tamista's thisty Plain, A Relation of the last glorious Victory of the Christians over the Turks, near the River Drave. THE Hardships suffered by the Imperi∣alists, as well in going to the Enemies, when they were encamped under Esseck, as in returning thence, having as it were spent all their Forces, the Duke of Lorrain had no sooner pass'd the Drave again, but that he prevail'd with the Duke of Bavaria to draw near the Danube, where Provisions could not be so scarce as in the Parts whence they came. This was a Course so necessa∣ry for the Army, that there was no other way to rescue it from absolute Ruine; the Cavalry, more especially, had been in want of Forrage for above a Month, for having been almost continually in the Mo∣rasses, it had had no other subsistence than what they afforded.
The Turks knowing its distress, and be∣ing also encourag'd by what had befallen them near Esseck, they marched after it. In the mean while the Imperialists got to Mo∣hatz', where they stay'd eight whole days to recover themselves of their. Fatigues. There the Danube furnish'd them with abun∣dance of Provisions, and their Army being in some wise recoverd, a Council of War was held to consult on what undertaking it should be employed. Herein it was re∣solv'd that Alba-Regalis should be besieged, and that they should immediately begin their march to execute this design. During these Transactions, some Parties of Tartars advanced under favour of the Woods, and snapt up our Forragers. The next day they did the same again, and our Spies brought back word that the whole Turkish Army was at hand, and was moving onward with Intention of beleaguering Ziolos. A deser∣ter and a Prisoner, taken by a Party, con∣firm'd this Report; whereupon a new Council of War was held, the Result of which was to demolish Ziolos and Five-Churches, take the Garrisons thence, and all that was within them, and then to march on to Alba-Regalis, where we were in hopes of making good Lines before the Turks could come up to us. On the 8th of August
we left Mohatz to put this design in Execu∣tion, but we had no sooner begun our march, but that there appeared a body of 3000 horse, that advanced very near us, which compelld us to halt. It skirmish'd in good order, insomuch as to hinder the Army from getting that day to the place where the Duke of Lorrain had design'd to encamp. Thus it stop'd within half a league above Mohatz, where the Spies not only confirmd the News they had brought the day before, but further, that the Grand Visier had so efficaciously represented to the Grand Seignior, that he was in a Condition to fight the Christians, that he had received Orders to give battel. The Duke of Lorrain im∣parted these News to the Elector of Bavaria and the General Officers, who did not que∣stion the Truth of the Information, seeing with what boldness the 3000 Horse had stoppd them the day before. Nevertheless they persisted in the design they had pro∣jected, and orders were given for the con∣tinuing the march on the morrow. In the mean while, part of the Night was spent in sending out parties, and in clearing our Arms. The Parties gave not any Account on which any Reliance could be had, but a Spy that had been in the Turks Camp brought back word, that the Grand Visier had
caus'd the Orders he had received from Constantinople to be proclaimed throughout the Camp, with a promise of reward∣ing all those that should behave them∣selves as became them in the battel. The Imperial Army having renew'd its march at break of day, it was again disturb'd by a body of Horse, that did not discontinue skirting it, and ever and anon coming up to try its temper; the Duke of Lorrain drew up Forces to receive it, but they made such an orderly retreat, that there was no way to get them to an Engagement. This passd on the 9th of the Month, and the Enemies Conduct was still the same on the 10th and 11th still following the Army that was marching towards Ziolos; at last the Imperialists being come that day near the Hill of Hersan, at the foot of which was formerly a fine Village bearing the same Name, but which War has totally ruined, the Duke of Lorrain had notice that the Grand Visier, after having march'd day and night, had made such expedition that he was but a league distant from him, nay that he had possess'd himself of a Wood that was on his way, and wherein he had put some Troops, hoping to fall upon his in the flank; as nothing was to be neglect∣ed with such an Enemy, that since the be∣ginning
of the Campaign had exerted such great skill and experience as was not to have been expected in the Turks, it was thought expedient to call a Council of War anew; it was the Elector of Bavarias turn to command the Van-guard the next day; but as it was dangerous to make such a movement, it was resolved, contrary to what is commonly practised in a march, that every one should remain at the Post where he was the day before. We again sent out several Parties, but of few men on∣ly, to know exactly whether what was said of the Enemy was true; but the Ene∣my on his side being not willing to lye still, sent 2 or 3000 Horse that very Evening, which gave an Allarum to the Camp. As the whole Army stood at their Arms, it was impossible for them to do any thing, on the contrary they were driven back to the very thickets, and we durst not push them further, as fearing there might be some considerable Succours behind the Bushes. The Duke of Lorrain, to be ascer∣tain'd of this, caus'd men to climb up to the Hill of Hersan, and they bringing him word that there appeared a great body beyond the thickets, some Voluntiers advanc'd to fire their Pistols at them; but not being so advantageously mounted as many of the
Turks they went to attack, they were im∣mediately surrounded, and their Heads hewn off in the Presence of the whole Ar∣my. This was done with such fearful how∣lings, that it daunted all those that had not yet been engag'd with those Barbarians. In the mean while, each man withdrow into the Camp, and as it was not questiond but that there would be a considerable brush the next day, the greater part of the Gene∣rals spent the Night on Horseback, and towards break of day the Enemies came to surprize and take away the main Guard. Some blows were given in this occasion, but the Imperialists being in a due Posture, they killed five or six Turks for as many of theirs which fell upon the Place. One of those Barbarians who was not yet dead, ha∣ving been questiond, said that the Grand Visier was hard by with his Army, consisting of 70000 men, that he had been retrenching himself all the Night, that he had also lin'd the Wood above mention'd with more men, that he pretended he was so advantageously encampd, that he braggd he should defeat the Christian Army, with∣out being compell'd to give Battel. Here∣upon a Council of War was held a-new, and as the falling back would have been the abandoning of Zyclos, and the other
Places on the Drave, they agreed to pursue their march towards the former of those Places. The Orders having accordingly been given, the Duke of Lorrain put himself at the head of the Vanguard, which was composed of the right Wing, and that he might be under Covert from the Enemies that were in the Wood, he left some Dra∣goons and Battalions to cover the flank of the Horse. The Enemies lying at watch to take their Advantages, made then a Move∣ment which perplex'd the Duke of Lorrain; He perceiv'd that they were going to fall upon the Duke of Bavaria; wherefore he De∣tach'd Picolomìni with his Brigade to go and give him Succours. And indeed they began to Skirmish with that Duke, who advan∣cing to encourage his Men by his presence, a Turk slipt along under favour of the Bush∣es, and seeing the Elector have a Red-Em∣broidered Coat on, with a white feather in his Hat, and thence presuming him to be a Person of Quality, he fancy'd it would be a brave Exploit in him to kill him. Where∣upon he fired his Fusil at him, but instead of hitting him in the Body, he hit him in the left hand, and this made so much noise that all those that were not far from his Person believed him to be dangerously wounded. Without farther Enquiry this
same rumour was immediately spread a∣bout his Troops, and this might have been of ill Consequence, had he not shewn him∣self immediately to them all. In the mean while, the Army being on its march, and the Vanguard having pass'd a Bottom, it mov'd up along a furrow, at the upper End of which there was a Hedg that covered a Plain; beyond this Hedge were some Turkish Horse, which were to a∣muse the Duke of Lorrain, while the main Body fell upon the Duke of Bavaria, making a shew as if they meant to come to Blows with him; but having avoided the Battel at the same time they seem'd to offer it, the whole stress fell upon the Duke of Ba∣varia, who having orders not to Engage, contented himself with standing upon the Defensive part. This did still the more Em∣bolden the Infidels, & coming up very close, and every other moment to try his Tem∣per, he sent to acquaint the Duke of Lorrain with the posture of his Affairs, and to ask his leave to fight. The Duke of Lorrdin sent him back word to follow the Orders they had agreed on in the Morning, but his Elec∣toral Highness seeing himself still more and more pressd, sent back to tell the Duke of Lorrain, that when they were in a Coun∣cil of War, they might argue as they pleas'd,
but that when the Enemies were pouring upon them the case was very Different; that every other minute there fell upon him new Batallions and new Squadrons, which it was impossible for him to stand the Brunt of, by meerly keeping upon the De∣fensive part, that his Men being thereby Ex∣posed, began to murmur at so much pru∣dence; that it was to be feared that after their having suffer'd much, they might take the Course of avoiding the Danger by flight, since possibly they would imagine they might honourably do so, since we led 'em not to fight. During these Occurrences the Number of the Infidels did visibly multiply, and ha∣ving flipt along a Wood, they wholly fac'd it, insomuch that when the Imperialists came to pass, they made a Discharge upon them, which laid some of them upon the spot, and compell'd the Rest to halt. To per∣plex them the more, they appeared at the same time at the Vauntguard, but then De∣sign being to make their utmost Onsets on the side of the Elector of Bavaria; they pro∣ceeded no further than to Skirmish which hindred the Duke of Lorain from being able to send other Succours than that before-mentioned to the Reer. In the mean while, as every thing till then had promis'd them
the Victory, a Body that had not as yet fall'n on, advanc'd upon the Duke of Ba∣varia, with dismal screams and howlings, insomuch that he saw himself thereby forcd, without staying for permission to fight, to use his utmost Endeavours to free himself from so great a danger. He made head against them with such Troops in whom he most Confided, and having caus'd small Field-Pieces to be plac'd at the head of the Batallions, they were put to so good a use that they kept the Enemies in great Respect. In the mean while, Picolomini; who, as has been said, was sent to the Duke of Bavaria's Succours, thinking him in great Danger, ran to him with his Men, and the Duke seeing him come, Commanded him to drive the Turks from a Bottom, which he had newly passed himself. Picolomini ex∣ecuted this Order with great Courage, and being seconded by good fortune, he not only remained Master of the Bottom, but also pursued the Enemies to the very Wood, which they still possess'd, and which was the place of their Retreat. There they per∣ceived that they had unaccountably given way, since he had none to back him; Inso∣much that being ashamed of what they had done, they returned to the Charge, and made such havock of the Regiment of Com∣merci,
which was of that Brigade, that in a trice they killed 200 of its men. The rest seeing this, betook themselves to flight, and the sooner, for that they were all terrified to see these Barbarians, who had cut off the heads of the greater part, which they car∣ried before them, howling at such a rate, as was capable of daunting the most Reso∣lute. In this Occasion was it that the Prince of Commerci was wounded with a Launce, and that the Count de Ligneville, the Major of his Regiment was killed, whose Head they cut off as well as the rest. The rest of the Turkish Cavalry, having this advantage on its side, fell anew with extraordina∣ry fury upon the Duke of Bavaria, who was not a little put to it to stand the first Onset; Nevertheless having with his own Person performed Wonders, and thereby given an Example to others, they all stood firm; Insomuch that after a long and obstinate fight the Turks begat to Buckle; but in such good order, that in turning their backs they seem'd less to Fly then make a Retreat. This induced the Elector to consider whether he ought to pursue them or not; but that held him not long in suspence, they of themselves return'd to the Charge, and that with so much Re∣solution and Fury, that had not the Elector
commanded Cannon to be brought, they had been Capable of routing him. but ha∣ving causd it to be charg'd with Cartridg∣es, he dispersed the most daring. An infi∣nite number of Volleys were fired in a trice, and this with so much success, that we heard the Cries of those that were wounded by them, which did so very much intimidate the rest, that they betook themselves to flight. They retired aside the Wood, which made us halt for some time, apprehending it might be lin'd, and that inste of pro∣secuting a Victory, we might zard the receiving an Affront. In the mean while, the Duke of Bavaria having caus'd it to be view'd, and none of them being there found, we pursued them, but the Pursuit was not long. After we had march'd a ve∣ry little time we perceived they had entred into Retrenchments, which we could scarce believe tho' we saw it with our Eyes. These Retrenchments had indeed been made in haste, and we saw they had not had time to compleat them; but as their scituation was advantageous (for they were between a Morass and a Wood) it was not judg'd convenient to advance further without first using mature consideration. We perceived it to be the Grand Visiers Camp, which was confirmed to us by some
Prisoners, who inform'd us that there were still several fresh forces that had not as yet stirred out of it. This occasion'd new thoughts, as also for that the head of this Camp was defended by a battery of twelve Pieces f Ordnance, which began to speak to us in Thunder. It was still further aug∣mented in a moment, and the Turks fearing that the Imperialists would undertake to force them, notwithstanding so many dif∣ficulties fell to work in our very fight to stop up me Passages that were as yet quite open. y, and we perceived a Man with a Turbat all beset with Jewels, and a stately Vestment give his Orders without seeming to be under the least Concern. We judg'd as well by his Character as from the richness of the things mentioned, that if it was not the Grand Visier, it was at least a Person of very great Eminency among them. This whetted the Greedi∣ness of the Soldiery, who being vex'd that they had fought so long without having got any thing, ask'd why they stopp'd at such small Impediments. The Elector was altogether of the same Opinion, but the General Officers about him having given him to understand that the undertaking to force those Rorenchments without Can∣non, would be too great a venture, several
Pieces were brought up, which were plac'd battery-wise with wonderful Expedition. The greater part of the Retrenchment be∣ing only of Dirt and Mud, having been hereby levell'd in a trice, all of a sudden we saw the Cavalry march, without stay∣ing for Orders, telling each other that if they could but pass, they were enriched for ever. That of the Turks seeing it coming with so much resolution grew daunted, and without staying for its coming up, fled cowardly away, abandoning the In∣fantry to the Discretion of the Conquerors. The Janizaries were startled at the Deser∣tion of their Horse, nevertheless they marched up to the breach, which they de∣fended with such Courage as was near a-kin to despair. But the Cavalry having open'd it self a passage thro' other Places, they were quickly surrounded and put to the Sword. The rest of the Infantry suffered very much, and none escaped but the most ready at their heels. All the Tents were found in the Camp, which the Elector ha∣ving entred made directly up to that of the Grand Visier, which was observable for its extraordinary Wealth, and for several marks which are peculiar to the Generals of those Barbarians. He found no body in it, nor about it, tho' it was well worth the
pains of looking to, as well in regard of its self, as of what it contain'd. In the mean while the Duke of Lorrain advanced, and complemented his Electoral Highness upon the happy success of that day, but having not leisure to enlarge much upon that, he gave Dunewaldt orders to pursue the Runaways, and detach'd ten thousand Horse for that Expedition. This General found some of the Fugitives on the way, but making directly to the Bridge which the Turks had o're the Drave, he found the main body had pass'd it, and had broke the Bridg after them. But the shore was all strew'd with Cloaths, and Bodies lay floating o're the River. Two Bassas, and several of the Principal Officers were taken Prisoners, with about 800 common Souldiers, and the dead ten times as many. The Conquerors got all the Canon, con∣sisting in 90 Pieces of Ordnance, and twelve Mortar-pieces, with Tents, Camels, Wag∣gons, and Elephants in abundance, with all other sorts of booty almost beyond Imagi∣nation. This Victory cost the Imperialists not above 600 men, as they themselves say, and as others eighteen hundred. Thus does the God of Battels make each man His Power and Might in every Action own, And that 'tis he that rules the World alone.
THE SECOND PART. THE Souldiers Encouragement: Or, the Nobleness of his Profession highly to be prized and esteemed; in a modest and brief Essay, containing the necessity of it in all Empires, Kingdoms, and Estates; with Directions to a young Soldier or Officer, worthy os his notice, &c. HAving thus far, Reader, proceeded to give you an Account, accord∣ing to what I find in the best Historians, of such memorable Battels, as upon which, for the most part, depended the fates of Kingdoms; and the great Captains of sundry Nations, thereby to raise in them a thirst for, and a desire to, Military Glory, which is for the most part attended by Fame and Renown; I shall
continue to say something that may yet prove more profitable and advantageous especially to the young Souldier; and first of his usefulness, and the Nobleness of his Profession, &c. As there are but chiefly four conditions, or main supports in a Civil Life, viz. the Sword, the Gown, Trade and Husbandry, so these are so linked together, that the one can but badly subsist without the o∣ther, and rarely the latter without the former, for as the Gown makes and ad∣ministers wholesome Laws, to hinder the stronger from oppressing the weaker, and to deter evil-minded men through sear of punishment, those Laws would be frequent∣ly violated & contemned by such, as would violently break through them, to execute their own wicked purposes and advanta∣ges, were not they protected by the Sword, which over-aws offenders, by carrying with it a Power sufficient to put them in execution, nor could the Merchants secure∣ly pass the Seas, to Inrich by Foreign Traf∣fick their Native Land, were they not fre∣quently Convoyed, by a Power sufficient to guard and protect them, from Pirates and Sea-Rovers, who contemn all Laws, and measure the success of right and wrong by violence and force of Arms, to the ruin
of peaceable and industruous men, or how could the laborious Husband-man gather the fruits of his Labour; and the Increase of the Earth, did not the fear of Punishment restrain such, as otherways would spoil and waste them, or convert to their own use, what never caused any sweat to de∣scend upon their brows, nor does any thing in a State more contribute to its greatness and tranquility, than an orderly and well governed Souldiery, who are at all times ready to expose their Lives to the utmost hazard and danger, in righting Injuries and affronts done to their Prince or Country; so that as well the Enemies at home, as those abroad, desist through fear of punishment, from those lawless enterprises, which otherwise they would be continually putting in practice, to the great disquiet, if not subversion of the State or Kingdom, for which tranquility and quiet Repose, a Souldier may with the least Imputation to be layed to his charge of arrogating vain glory to him∣self, conclude in some measure his Coun∣try beholden to him, nor has it been held amiss to count the profession of Arms one of the noblest, and most to be esteemed a∣mongst all others, not only for the causes I have mentioned, but for sundry other
pregnant Reasons, for by it Men's fortunes are Raised, many times from the lowest degree, to the very top of Greatness: and not only their Fortunes, but their Fame, which continues as a grateful Remem∣brance to their Country, and an honour to their Posterity: nor can the profession be said to be beneath the Regard of those of the Noblest rank, seeing the fortunes of Empires and Kingdoms are so often cast in the Ballance, and require not only Valour, but Caution, Experience, and sound Judgment, to rescue them from many dangers. Nor must those that would be truly accounted brave in this way, be unfurnished with good qualities and moral Virtues, as Prudence, Conduct, Valour, hardiness, patience, but above all, seeing a Souldier carries his Life in his hand, he must be indued with Religious and Pious Principles, that his Conscience being at peace, the terrors of Death, and conse∣quently of a fearful Judgment after it, may not terrifie or deter him from under∣taking any Enterprize that is brave and daring; for although a man given up to wickedness, may, when danger is afar off, seem bold and desperate, yet when Death stares him in the face, the thoughts of his Immortal state will trouble him, and the
twinges of Remorse maketh his Courage flag; there are many things more, neces∣sary to be known, to which great Regard ought to be had, and especially, When a young Gentleman, in what sta∣tion soever, enters the Army, without prejudice to his Reputation, he ought to understand that he is obliged to shew great Respect to those that are his Superiours in Place or Command, a civil Respect to his Equals, and to have a Love and Cha∣ritable Regard to his inferiours, or such as are under his Command, that in so doing he may win their affections, to stand by him in the greatest Extremity; for, espe∣cially where the Souldiers love their Of∣ficer, they will never leave him in any action, and gain to him a great deal of Reputation, when on the contrary they will many times shrink from him in the heat of the fight, sacrificing their honour to their Revenge; wherefore although his Courage be never so great, he is ob∣liged to yield to Invincible necessity, yet it is more honourable to be taken Priso∣ner, than to turn his back and fly, for if he be once suspected of Cowardice, it will be very difficult to raise his sinking Repu∣tation, and in many things it is better to confess Ignorance than be Presumptious to
undertake any thing he understands not, for those to whom he makes such an in∣genious acknowledgment, will rather compassionate than deride him, and take pleasure to instruct him, to shew their own Experience, and Reward his mode∣sty, nor is it any dishonour to ask advice, upon Important occasions, by way of opi∣nion, nor need he therein discover his own weakness, but by a kind of a secret Inquiry, inform himself in what may prove advantageous: There are some General Rules that ought to be known by all, especially by Commanders, viz. that a Captain of Horse ought no more to dis∣pute the command with a Captain of Foot in a Garison, than the other ought to do it with him in the Field, for in do∣ing it he would very much wrong his judgment, nor ought an elder Captain in a younger Regiment to expect he should without peculiar Orders, or an extraor∣dinary Commission command a younger Captain in an elder Regiment, for their Rank is otherwise, according to the Anti∣quity of the Regiment, and not accord∣ing to the Date of the Commission; nor is there a small respect required from subal∣ternates, to their Superiours respectfully, in all places, thereby to gain love, credit,
and applause, even of the meanest; and thus having made a small Essay, not un∣necessary to be taken notice of, by young Souldiers, and Officers: I shall now pro∣ceed to speak something of Gunnery, whereby those that are desirous to become Engeniers, may in some measure be ad∣vantaged, in their first undertakings, and then to speak of Artificial Fire-Works, and their use, as they relate to War, and Re∣creation, that nothing material may be omitted, that can be conceived necessary for the Adornment of this Work. That Arts and Arms may equally be twyn'd, Mars and Minerva in one Circle joyn'd, To give more lustre to the warlike Scene, By making publick that which envies screene, In darkness shades, as loath to let it see, The long'd for light, where it so fain would be.
THE YOUNG Engeniers Master-piece: OR, A TREATISE of GƲNNERY In all its material Parts and Particu∣lars, guiding and directing in what of that kind relates as well to Sea as Land. In knowing and managing any piece of Ordnance to the best Advantage on all Occasions, and sundry other Matters, and things highly ne∣cessary to be known, &c. AS for the Person who will undertake to be an expert Gunner, it is highly requisite that he be not unskilful in, or a stranger to the Mathematicks, whereby he will be incapacitated to work any Pro∣portion by Rule, and consequently be ob∣liged to manage his undertaking by guess, rather than by any certain Rule; nor is the Art of Geometry to be neglected, see∣ing height, breadth, and depth, as well
as lengths are to be observed in this kind of mensuration, that so the plot of any piece of Ground or convenient distance may be taken to advantage. And as for the Necessaries wherewith he ought to be provided, I hope few or none that proceed to this undertaking are ignorant: yet I think it not amiss to mention what is re∣quisite, that none may plead ignorance; and in this case they must have in a readi∣ness the following Materials, viz. Spare Wheels and Axeltrees, Rammers, Ladles or Scoups, Sheep-skins well wool∣ed for Sponges to clear the Piece, Canvas or strong Paper to make Cartrages when the Piece is hot and will not Indure loose Powder without siring it as soon as it is cast in, of which more hereafter: as for shot of all kinds, according to the undertaking, he ought to be stored, together with Arti∣ficial Fireworks and Torches, dark Lan∣thorns, &c. hand Spikes, Budgbarrels, Baskets, Match, and a well armed Line∣stock, with a pair of Compasses called Caliber Compasses, to take the exact Dia∣miter of the shot, and the bore of his piece, ever observing to charge according to the thinnest part of the Mettal, thereby to prevent breaking; and another thing ne∣cessary is to be observed, viz. When a piece
to be fired lyes upon a direct line, or under Mettal, be sure to ram it with a good wad, lest the Powder lying hollow, and not full up to the Mettal, burst it; and that he may move or traverse his piece at pleasure, he must have Crows of Iron, Coins of Wood, and take special care to know the depth of the Chamber or charging part; he must likewise be furnished with a scale whereby he may know the force, weight, measure, and carriage of his piece, as also the pro∣portion on the charge, and the weight of the shot. As for the Names of the greát Pieces commonly in use, they are the Base, the Rabanet, the Faulconet, the Faulcon, the ordinary Minnion, the Minnion of the largest size, the Sacker the lowest sort, the ordinary Sacker, the Sacker of the oldest sort, the lowest Demiculverin, the eldest sort of Demiculverin, the ordinary Demiculverin, the Culverins of the best size, ordinary Culverin, Culverin of the largest size, lowest Demicannon, ordinary Demicannon, Demicannon of the great size, Cannon Royal, or of the largest size; and to these, according to their weight and bore, ought to be proportioned the charge of Powder and Shot; and by that Rule likewise one may know how far a Piece
will carry; as suppose a Piece be eight foot long, weighing 1500 weight, and four in∣ches Diamiter in the bore, charge it (for so much it requires) with 4 pounds of Powder, and it will carry a shot of 61. 160 paces, of five foot to the pace, provided it be not defective by Reason of Flaws or Hony∣combs, and so proportionable the rest of greater or lesser weight. As for a true piece, it is for the better distinction divided by Gunners into several parts, and thus distinguished, viz. the out∣ward most part of the breech is called the Cascabel Deck, the Ring next to the Touch-hole the base Ring, and the space between the Touch-hole and the next Ring is called the Chamber or charging Cilin∣der, and the second Ring the Ramforce Ring, the third is called the Tronion or ballance Ring, that next the Muzzle is cal∣led the Cornice Ring, the Extreamity is called the Muzzle, the top the Superficies, and the whole length the chace, by readily knowing which any assistant to a Gunner may understand what he is required to do. As for Shot they are generally three sorts, either Lead, Iron, or Stone, according as the store can furnish, or the Emergency requires; and in these, according to their weight, there is a disproportion in bigness,
which to prevent trouble in a hasty En∣terprize, ought to be considered, lest in weighing alike, they prove (especially the latter) useless, by being too big for your Piece, and thus we consider them. The proportion between Lead and Iron is six to nine, so that a shot of Iron of six pound weight, is as big as a shot of Lead weighing nine pound, and the proportion between Iron and Stone is three to eight, by which means a shot of thirty pound of stone, is as big as a shot of eighty pound of Iron, and so proportionable. If there be any cracks, flaws, or honey∣combs in a piece, which not only hinder its carriage, but many times indanger its breaking, you may discover the former, viz. stop the muzle and touch-hole of the Piece, so soon as ever you have shot it off, and if there be any such thing, the smoke will come through insensible cranies, but if it be defective; by reason of the latter, viz. honey-combs, which are a sponginess, or scaling of the metal within, you must search it with a piece of candle, in a long cleft stick, or by reflecting the Sun-beams into it with a Looking-glass, which will occasion so much light, that one may thereby discover them, though there is little remedy to be had in these cases, for
the bettering the Piece, nor are they less to be discerned, by striking the Piece with an Iron hand-spike in all parts, for if it sound hoarse or jarring, then are there flaws and defects, but if it sound clear, then account it a perfect Piece, and to it you may accordingly proportion your charge, for if the Piece be not sound, or of no true bore, you must beware of o∣vercharging, least you endanger your self, and others. As for Cartrages, seeing they are very useful, in loading Pieces when hot, with often firing, and not able otherways to indure the powder, I shall speak some∣thing of them, and their use. Cartrages are usually made of stiff-pa∣per or canvass, upon a wooden Mould, proportionable to the Piece in the form of a Rocket-cartoush, but larger, the first of these must be done by rowling the pa∣per thick, and pasting it in each rowling, fixing to it a firm bottom, and the last by sowing or glewing strong canvass in the like nature; into the cavity put so much powder as is a sufficient charge for the Piece, and stop it in lightly with paper, or flax, and so thrust the hard end fore∣most into the chamber of the piece, lea∣ving about an inch vacant, that it may
the better take air, and so with a sharp priming Iron, pierce it through the touch∣hole and prime, then follow it with your shot, and discharge as you see occasion, but by the way you must observe that your Cases be dry, least by damping the powder they prevent its firing, as also to make them according to the proportion of the piece, that so without any diffi∣culty, they may be ready at hand on all occasions; as for the Ramers, Ladles and Sponges, all the difficulty in them, is to fit and proportion them to the respective pieces, having good stuff in order thereto. As for the wheels and carriages of pieces, they ought to be much regarded, especially in case of a march, lest by their defect in breaking, they hinder any extraordinary Enterprize, and it as often happens for want of a true mounting wherefore take notice, that one and a half the length of the cilender of the bore, or chamber of the piece, should be the length of the car∣riage, and the depth four damiters of the bore or concave in the middle, but at the end next the ground not above the thick∣ness of the diamiter of the shot; as for the wheels they ought to be strong, and one half of the length of the piece in height if for Land-service, but if for Sea a less proportion will serve.
As for the Turneons they must be so placed that the piece may stand true mount∣ed, lest a false shot be often made, and in this case two thirds of the piece must ap∣pear above their Center, nor must Cor∣dage be wanting, especially at Sea; and those being strong, ought to be four times the length of the piece, and the britchings twice the length of the piece, though great Pieces for fear of breaking loose, and over∣swaying the Ship, are often coined and braced so straight that they cannot give much way, especially in case of a storm. Now to charge and fire a piece dexterously, and like a Gunner, let those that undertake it observe this Method. Lay your budg-barrel or Cartrages of Powder to the Wind-ward, and your Lin∣stock with the fired Match to the Lee-ward, placing your self on the right side of the Piece, and having cleansed the Concave and the Touch-hole, fill your Ladle, but so as no Corns may scatter over, then charge it into the piece as home as you can, turning it by the end of the staff with your Thumb and Fingers, being sure to keep your Body clear of the Muzzle, and so drawing out your Ladle, ram a wad by three or four quick stroaks of your Ram∣mer to prevent the Powder from scatte
in the Chamber; then put in the shot, and after it a wad in like manner, so that the Powder may be forced yet closer, where∣by it will deliver the shot with greater vi∣olence, and prevent any Vacancy that may occasion the bursting of the piece; and whilst this is doing, you must cover the Touch-hole to prevent any accidental fire from falling into it, then prime by draw∣ing a Train to the base Ring, and so give fire, ever observing not to touch the Touch-hole with your Match-coal, lest it blow both that and your Linstock out of your hand, and disable it for some time of doing service, especially if the Touch∣hole be any thing large. If you are required to shoot at a random mark, or by Elevation, you ought to un∣derstand that the Random of a piece is the intire distance from the place of dis∣charge to the place where the Bullet first falls or grazes on the level Line, or on the Ground, by Artists termed the Horizential Plain, and to obtain the true knowledge of this it must be practised in a level Ground where nothing may obstruct the level Line, or leveling of the shot, and therein observe the distances of the paces from the Piece to the fall, then mount the Muzzle one degree, and take again the
like notice; and in still mounting by de∣grees, you will be capable of perceiving how far the piece will carry mounting, or at the level with an equal proportion of Powder, even to the tenth degree, or so high as your piece is capable of mounting, which will in a good piece advance thirty or forty paces, of five feet to the pace, through which means an experienced Gun∣ner by his Map may be certain at what distance to make his shot, whether into the Trenches or a Town, or to dismount the Enemies Cannon, or to batter a Wall, Bul∣wark, or the Ranks of an Army; but if he would make a good shot at a party of mo∣ving Horse or Foot, or at a Ship under sail. Observe in the first place your length, to know certainly whether or not you are within reach, and if so it being in a straight Line, in the second place consider the slowness or swiftness of the motion of the men or ship you intend to hit, and there∣upon lying upon an equal level, neither too high nor too low, fire at another mark some distance before it, and beyond that, so by the two motions the Bullet and the Mark you design to hit may meet, for al∣though the Bullet flys with incredible swift∣ness, yet it requires some small time to accomplish its end.
But if you aim at any Light either on the Sea or on the Shoar in a dark Night, then fix a piece of lighted Match, or a bit of a Torch on the Muzzle of the piece, and bringing that ánd the middle of the base Ring even with the light, if it stand still, or be passing on in a direct line, and give fire, by which means if your piece be stea∣dy and carry true, you can hardly miss your aim. If a shot by reason of over-rash charging (with one above proportionable size) stick in the piece, whereby if it be fired hastily it indangers the breaking, dissolve bay Salt in Vinegar, and pour it in at the Touch-hole till it has melted the Powder, then strike the piece where the Bullet sticks, the piece being lowred with the muzzle downwards, and it will fall out; if not, let the piece dry, and then put Powder in at the Touch-hole till you find a small charge, and so give fire, having struck the Bullet before with your Rammer to loosen it. It is worth observing that if a piece by reason of its being often shot off be very hot, it loses much of its force every time (after the second or third time) lessening something of its motion as to the distance; wherefore if the occasion will permit, it is best to let them cool between every shot,
but if not, cool them as well as you can with your Spong diped in Water, &c. If at any time a Gunner for want of skill, or by mistake has placed his piece amiss, so that the shot flys wide of the mark, to mend it he must observe how much wide he was, if the shot has hit any part near the mark, and if it be too high, then must he bring the piece a degree low∣er, or according to the distances he per∣ceives he erred in; but if on one side, then must the piece be breeched about, and if too low it must be better leaveled, ever observing that in making a true shot it is requisite to bring the middle of the base Ring even with the middle of the muzzle Ring, both which being exactly measured, may be notified by sticking up a nail by the help of a piece of Wax or Clay, and both those brought even with the mark, only the top of the former to be seen, give fire, and your Expectation, if the piece be a clever shooter, will be answered. Many it is true, leavel their Ordnance by Rule, and indeed it is the exactest way, though somewhat tedious, yet may it be done without any Rule by the help of a steady Eye, especially if the piece be true, and a far shooter, only it requires the Gunner to be skilful in guessing at the
distance of the mark, whither it be in a right Line, mounting or declining, by bringing the mark even with the Muzzle and Base-ring exactly in the middle. It is not the least of the Gunners care to procure good powder, such as may ea∣sily take fire, and retain its full strength, for powder in long lying, taking unsea∣sonable wet or the like, will lose so much of its strength, that a pound and a half will not work the effect of one pound, nay, that which is at the bottom of the Barrel is much more forcible than that which is at the top, and the reason is, because the force of the Salt-peter, if it be not moved or stired about, tends downward, now to know good powder from bad, observe these Rules: First, feel whether the Corns are well dryed, being of a dark blewish colour, and taste much of the fire; secondly, take some of the Corns, and lay them upon a sheet of white paper, and if when you fire them, they leave a black mark or yel∣low sindge behind them, then is the pow∣der gross and earthy, and will neither en∣dure well, nor be of any great force, but if it leave no mark, or at least a white one resembling white smoke, then is the powder good, and will fire both quick and with great force.
If the Powder be nought and unfit for se, to fine and strengthen it take it and bruise it to dust with a wooden beam or beater; then add to every pound an ounce of Salt-peter reduced into meal, sifting them together through a fine Sieve or Boulter till they are very well mixed, then having a Sieve of Parchment pun∣ched full of holes, mix the Ingredients with water, till with a wooden Bowl you may press them thro' the holes in cornes, which lying in an indifferent warm and dry place will harden of themselves, and so that powder which was very weak will become very strong, and do Execution equal with any, or to make it the stronger you may use Aqua vitae instead of water, and making it up into balls, keep them in a dry Chest for your use. White Powder is compounded of Salt-peter, six times so much as of Brimstone, and twelve times so much as of Camphire, all finely beaten and incorporated to a de∣gree, that no knops or knots may be found therein, then moisten them with Brandy or Aqua vitae, and when you have so or∣dered the Ingredients, corn them as the former, or make them up into fine balls for your use, &c. If you design to charge a Mine, which is many times a Gunner's
business, you may do it either with Bags, Sacks or Barrels of Powder, though to pre∣vent dampness the latter is the best, be∣cause the Powder in some Mines, where the ground is low, is obliged to lie upon floats, by reason of the Springs that are there met withal, then must the Powder be layed, so that by a Trane through canes or wooden troughs, the Bags or Casks may communicate with each other, and charged over with beams of wood, that it may rise directly, and not swerve to either part, or bursting at the vent, it answer not your expectation, as for him that fires it, he may do it by a Match laid to the Train, and know by that how many hours it will be e'er it take fire, for six Inches of good Match will last an hour burning, or he may do it at a distance, through a cane train, or upon board. If a House be designed to be blown up, to prevent the progress of a fire, then the Barrel ought to be placed in the Vault or Cellar, under the main Beam, with a strong piece of wood set up against that beam, from a cross beam that covers the beam, that covers the barrel, to give the fire more force, which must if you would take it upright, be placed as near as you can in the middle or center of the Buil∣ding,
but if you would overthrow it, or turn it into a Street or Garden, then must it be placed near to that side you design to raise, and so by loosening the foundation, it will overturn it, as for the Train in this case, it may be layed upon boards, from the Powder covered, as it is laid with a woollen cloath, to prevent the sparks of fire from falling into it before the time intended, by which much mischief may happen both to the Engenier, and those that are assistant to him, as some times too sadly has happened. In case a Ship that is sunk in a River, or near the shoar, is not worth weighing, or cannot be well weigh'd, many hold it may be blown in pieces in the water, after this manner, viz. Let down the quantity of two Barrels of Powder, or more in a Brandy-punchin, or some such stench-Cask, doing it by the guidance of Ropes, sinking it with a greater weight into her Hold, if possible, or if that can∣not conveniently be done, it may be placed under her side, though the former is bet∣ter, and there being a long pipe of leather fixed into the bung of the Cask with rosin and pitch, that the water cannot penetrate, let the upper part of it be above water, supported by the floating of bladders, and
when all is fixed, have an Iron-bolt ready, that will easily slide down the pipe into the powder, which being red-hot will fire it, but as soon as ever you have delivered it, with a long pair of Pincers, it is the best way for you to make off with your Boat, least it be overturned with wrecks that will arise from the shattered Ship, or you basted with the sudden smoke that will arise out of the water, forced and rent in a fearful manner with the fury of the fire, that strugles to recover and joyn with its proper Element. If you will weigh any Ship or Ord∣nance, it must be done by lashing together Lighters, empty Casks, or wooden Floats at low water, having slung what you in∣tend to weigh, load them likewise, that they may sink the deeper, and the Cords or Chains may be drawn more streight, by which means at high-water, being unload∣ed, they will rise and raise with them what they are fastened to, if their proportion be equal, five Tun above the water, being computed to raise three times the weight in the water, by which method a greater, or lesser weight may be raised. It is requisite that a Gunner should know the weight of his piece, the better to enable him to understand what force
or strength it requires to draw it, or Re∣move it from place to place, and in this case many are marked, but some defective therein, wherefore if he have no oppor∣tunity of weighing them, he may accord∣ing to the proportion of those that are weighed, measure and guess according to computation, as near as may be, and then consider that a piece of 10000 weight re∣quires no less than 18 Horse and Oxen to draw it, especially in Winter time they must be in good case and strength to per∣form it, and where many times by reason of the steepness, the piece cannot be drawn by Beasts, it will require 100 men's strength to effect it. Many other things of this kind I might set down, but seeing these are the most material, and my intention being no other than to instruct Beginners, who are not Proficients in Experience; I shall say no more at this time, but proceed to another useful part of Engenry, no less useful for a Gunner to know, by reason at one time or other it may greatly advantage him: and this consists in making Artificial fire∣works, useful in War by Land and Sea, as likewise very pleasant for Recrea∣tion.
More Brats of Typhons brood are yet behind, Such as for Mankinds Ruine were design'd; Though little thought our tender Mother, Earth, In days of old to teem with such a Birth. She careful of her Sons, long time did shroud What now in Flame and Thunder speaks so loud. Directions to prepare Artificial Fire-works, use∣ful in Sieges or Fights at Sea. or Land, on sundry Occasions; and not only to make them the plainest and easiest way, but to use them to advantage, and to know to what particular ends they are designed, according to the Antient and Modern Engenry, &c. AS for Fire-works of Warlike use, es∣pecially in the siege of any Town, &c. they are commonly sent out of Brass Mor∣tars or great Ordnance, and some of those for Recreation out of Mortars made of Wood or strong Past-board, and sometimes Canvas. Those Mortars that are made of Brass are to be of the finest Mettal, thereby to be free from cracks and flaws, and in them it is to be observed that if any of their bores be ten Inches in the Diamiter, the Mortar ought to be one foot nine Inches in length, & the Chamber to be loaden with Powder three Inches and a half Diamiter, and five
Inches deep, the thickest of the Metal above the fire Port, ought to be three In∣ches and a half, and so by degrees to lessen or grow thinner to two Inches. As for Mortars of Wood they are bored and turned much in the fashion of the for∣mer, greater or lesser as occasion requires it, but ought to be plated within and with∣out with Tin or Copper, or they will be always in danger of bursting, and do but little Service. Mortars of Past-board are made upon Rowlers glewed still in the rowling, and corded over with Pitch and tarred Cords, and having cut off both ends so that they may be smooth and even, turn a foot and sholder to fasten the Trunk upon, and in the middle thereof let your Chamber be made for the Powder strongly plated within and without; and if the Mortar be six Inches diamiter, the Past-board must be an Inch and three quarters thick, and the Trunk about sixteen Inches long, the Chamber two Inches Diamiter must be three Inches deep, and when the Trunk is upon the breech of Wood, it must be fastned on with Coopers Nails, and corded over with pitch Cord, leaving so much space as may serve to bore a Touch-hole, but these are seldom used
but in Fire-works of Recreation, unless great necessity require them to throw small Bombs, and that mostly on Ship-board; but as for a Balloon, one of them will carry it an exceeding hight. A Granado in the first place is a hollow shell of Iron, Brass, and sometimes of Glass, in which there is left a hole to put in a fau∣cet or Pistol barrel to carry the fuse, in the Composition is commonly Brimstone, Salt-peter and dry Powder, the quantity of each being left in the mixture to the Discretion of the Engenier, as he intends either to fire or blow up any House, &c. and sometimes they are filled only with whole Powder; as for the fuse it is to be proportioned to the length the Granado is to fly, lest sooner expiring it fire the Gra∣nado, and break it in the Air, and is com∣monly made of Powder wet with Oyl of Petrolum, but sometimes made of Char∣ole, Brimstone and Powder beaten and finely sifted. In charging your Mortar you must con∣sider what quantity of Powder will carry the Granado, and so much being put into the Chamber, press it down with a wad of Flax, and after that place a Turf quite over it, filling the bottom of the Mortar, and so sling in your Granado by the help of Cords,
observing the fuse, which must be charg∣ed into it within an Inch of the head, stand directly in the middle, when having prim∣ed and touched the fuse, give immediately fire to the Mortar, whose Touch-hole you must be sure to keep always in good order, lest the fuse burn out before the Powder in the Chamber take fire, and so indanger not only the breaking of the Mortar, but the destroying of your self and others. There are an other sort of Granados, though to the same effect, made of Can∣vas and strong Past-board, wetted with Oyl of Spike, or it may be done with Brandy or Water, mold them upon a round ball of Wood with Glew and Pitch in each doubling, and when they are well dryed, cut them in half to take out the Ball, then put them together with Glew, and cover them over with other strong Canvas coated with Pitch, and so bind them strongly together with Cords, lea∣ving a hole to charge at, and for the fuse, and these many times do the same Execu∣tion as Shells, and ought to be managed the same way? but are sometimes filled with Wild-fire, Pitch, Rosin, &c. being then rather designed to fire than blow up. Hand Granados are in effect the same with the former, though much less, their
Shells are made of concave Iron, with a fuse of Paper, Reed or Quills, and sometime are made of Glass, Earth, or Wood, but those for Sea are more commonly of Can∣vas or Past-board, which are kept hollow by rowling upon a bottom of Twine, and pasted or glewed still in the rowling till they become an Inch thick in the case, when being dryed, one end of the thread left at a hole for that purpose is drawn out many there are that stick pieces of Lead, or half Musquet-bullets about them, that when they burst, those many forcibly scat∣ter and wound the Enemy. As for their Composition it is generally Powder, Brim∣stone and Salt-peter, but may be filled with dry Powder if occasion require it; the fuse being at the same time made of Wild∣fire, and grafted in with Pitch or soft Wax, leaving the head of it about a quarter of an Inch above the Shell. There has been formerly used in firing Towns and Castles a strange way, which is now altogether left off, yet it may not be amiss to recite it, viz. Instead of a Mor∣tar the Engeniers were wont to dig a deep cavety in the Ground slant ways, with the mouth of it towards the Town in the man∣ner of a mouted Cannon, bricking or stone∣ing it round in the form of a Well, in the
bottom of which they placed a Barrel, or as much as was convenient of Powder, laying Beams a cross over it, and upon those Beams a quantity of Turf and Earth, then having a huge Faggot of Timber prepared, bound strongly with Iron-chains, it was put into this place all on a fire, and so by the means of a Train, the Powder firing, blew it in∣to the place designed with great force, the ground serving in those days instead of a Mortar, but probably without any certain Aim. The Sea-men, for firing Ships, were wont to make flaming Arrows in this sort, viz. taking the head and shaft of a broad Arrow, and the Iron of the head being very long, they made an Oval-case of strong Canvas and Past-board, glewing it firmly in all parts, and this being filled with a composi∣tion of Salt peter, Gun powder, Brimstone, made into Wildfire with the Oyl of Petrol∣lum, is fixed upon the neck of the head, the case being punched full of holes, and when fired, and flung with a strong hand, it will stick in the side mast of a Ship, and if not suddenly prevented, will set it on fire. Stink-pots are made of Earth, and filled with Tar, Turpentine, and beaten Brimstone, in which is a great wad of Hemp, and ends of Rope, which being fired and thrown on
board, breaks upon the Deck with a stream of flame, sending withal such a stench and noisome smoke, that it not only indangers the Ship, which it many times fires, but forces the Men from their stations, and gives the throwers an opportunity to enter. Carcasses, now much in use, are made up with Leather and Canvas, strongly bound, glewed and pitched, filled with a composi∣tion of Powder, Brimstone, Salt-peter, Ro∣zin, Pitch, Turpentine, and the like, and thrown out of Mortars and Engins. The Art of making and preparing Artificial Fire-works for Recreation, after the newest and best Invention, in sundry forms and manners, pleasant and profitable, &c. AS for Artificial Fire works, there are sundry sorts relating to Recreation, but in general, I may reduce them under three heads, viz. those that ascend in the Air, those that expire on the Earth, and such as swim in the water, and these again I may as properly divide into three particular sorts, viz. Those for the Air are the Balloon, the Sky-rocket and the flying Saucission, for the Earth the fiery Lances, the ground Rocket,
and the ground Saucissions; for the Water, double and single Rockets, Globes or Balls, but before I proceed to the composition, I shall say something of the Moulds, &c. If the caliber or bore of your Mould be an Inch in Diameter, then ought it to be six Inches in length, being made for a Rock∣et of the Air, and the breech one Inch and a half, the Broach being no less than 3 Inches long, and in thickness a quarter of an Inch circumference, the Rowler in this case must be three quarters of an Inch Diameter, and the Rammer half an Inch, being hollow at one end to receive the Broach, for the car∣roush coffin must be loaded, the Broach be∣ing in; if the bore be two Inches Diameter, the Rocket must be a Foot long, if but half an Inch, it must be in length but three Inch∣es, and so proportionable, as it is more or less in the Diameter, as also the Breech must be coherent, or else they will never mount well. In the composition of a Sky-Rocket, the principal thing to be considered, is an exact and proportionable mixture, therefore for the composition of middle sized Rockets, add no more than two ounces of Charcole to a pound of Powder, both being bruised and searced through a fine Sieve of Lawn, or such a like material, with which fill your
Rocket, the Head and Broach being in, putting in the Powder by degrees, and pressing it down between each, filling with your Rammer, then try it, and if it break or burn out too fast, add more Charcole dust, but if it burn dull and refuse to mount, then add more Powder, and so order it, till you find it answer your expectation, and for defect of Charcole, you may use Seacole, finely beaten, but it will not make so bright a Tail, for as the Powder forces the Rocket to mount, so the Charcole makes the fiery train. If you would have it sparkle much in mounting, you may put some Salt-peter meal into it, if you would have your Rock∣et give a Report after the Fuse is spent, you must put a piece of Paper, when it is three parts charged, with the composition, and making a hole in the middle of it, put after it a Pistol charge, or so much as will fill it, of corned Powder unbruised, and so dou∣bling in the breech, seal it down with wax, pitch, or glow, observing always the Cases be well choaked in the Primer, or you may, for want of wax, or the like, choak the But end with a Cord, and so cut it off. To fire your Rocket for the Air, fasten to it a straight wand, sufficient to poise it, and fix it with the mouth, and the Tail
of the wand downward, upon some place above your height, and so with a Fuse or Match give fire, or by a Train you may fire six or seven together, making them spread in the Air, like fountains of fire. Ground Rockets, as to their Moulds, are made in the manner of the former, but the composition somewhat differs, for in this case Powder dust and Salt-Peter-meal very fine sifted are required, which must be for∣cibly rammed by degrees, till within an Inch of the Top, and then a Pistol charge of cor∣ned Powder being put in Choke up the end exceeding close with a small cord, and cut∣ting off what hangs over, leave it picked. In this manner Serpents, commonly used to adorn great Fire-works, are made, but if you intend them to mount, let your filling be only beaten Powder well fisted, and if you design them with a Train, then it will require some Charcole dust, at least an ounce to six ounces of Powder. To make the Resemblance of Golden Rain, and Stars of divers sorts, having filled a great Rocket for the Air, with a charge of hard Powder, make upon the breech of him a kind of a Gallery, by drawing over a greater case, or pasting on stiff paper, then having filled about thirty or forty Goose
quills, or so many as it will hold, with bea∣ten Powder, Brimstone, and Salt-peter, bore the end of the Rocket full of holes, and paste them into that vacancy, that they may not fall off till the Rocket is spent, and then by some Powder scattered under them, they taking fire will appear to those that are on one side of the, like the streamers of a Comet or golden rain, and to such as are under them like a show of fire. As for Stars, they are especially two sorts, made of dry and wet Powder; to make the first of these, take a pound of Salt-peter, half a pound of Brimstone, a quarter of a pound of bruised Gun-powder, beaten finely, and well sifted, sow up as much of this compo∣sition in a double Rag, pierced full of holes, as the quantity of a Walnut, and wet the Rag over on the ourside with the Oyl of Petrolum, fix of these six or eight upon the head of a great Rocket, so that when it is at its highest, they may take fire, at what time they will expand themselves in flame, and appear for a time to the Spectators like real Stars. The second sort of Stars are compounded of Salt-peter, half a pound of Brimstone and half a pound of Powder grosly bruised, and wet with the Oyl of Petrolum, and made up into Pellets as big as Wall-nuts, dry
them by rowling in the dust of dry Powder, and fix five, six, or seven of them upon a great Rocket, and send it up into the Air, by which means when it is spent, these Stars will fire, yet will not blaze bright as the for∣mer, but fall more like a body of Fire, by reason of the Composition of moisture. Stars there are of an other sort, which give reports at the going off like Pistols, and these are composed of Salt-peter, Brimstone and Powder made into Wildfire with Aqua fortis and Oyl of Tartar, fastned to the heads of short Cases filled with dry Powder, and of these a large Rocket will carry up eight or nine, and give fire to them upon its ex∣piring; but they ought for the better secu∣ring them till they fire, to be put into a great case, one part of which may shut over the stern of the Rocket. To make Fire-boxes, ire-launces, and Fountains of Fire, observe the following di∣rections. The Fire-box consists of a great many small Rockets put into a great Cartoush, which fired by Trains, fly out one by one, and sometimes altogether, with prodigious noise and fury. The Fire-launce in all respects is to be moulded as the ground Rocket, only the Cartoush must be Past-board glewed as it is
rolled, and bound about with small Cords, nor must there be any broach in it whilst it is a filling. The Composition if you desire it to have a long firy train upon the Water, must be one pound of Salt-peter, half a pound of Brimstone-dust, and half a pound of Powder all finely beaten together, with two ounces of Charcole dust, but if you would have it burn bright like a Candle, then to one pound of Salt-peter, and half a pound of Brimstone, put a quarter of a pound of Powder, and fasten to each of them a Rod in the nature of a Sky-Rocket, and they will when fired live along while upon the Water, and appear in a dark Night ex∣ceeding pleasant. To make Trees or Fountains of Fire, fix divers small Rockets on the head of a great one, by running their Rods through a broad overbearing of ast-board, and if they fire whilst the Rocket is ascending, they will spring up and spread in streams of Fire, re∣sembling the branches of a Tr, but if they fire when the Rocket is just spent and descend∣ing they will appear like the Streams of a Fountain in Fire. A Fire-wheel or Gerondel is very pleasant, especially to adorn the Angles of great Fire∣works, and is ordered after this manner: Prepare a wodden Wheel in the fashion of
a spinning Wheel, but the rim some what narrower, and fasten round it Rockets of the smallest size, so that the tail of the one may by a train wraped up in Paper, fire the head of the other, when as the Wheel being put upon a pin of wood, the Rockets will fire one by one, and the force of them will carry it round with incredible swiftness till all be spent; observe to put them upon the Wheel in the nature of a Wheel-band, &c. The Balloun is accounted the most ex∣cellent of all Fire works, tending to Recre∣ation, and must be shot out of a Past-board Gun or Mortar, to make which I have al∣ready given directions. As for the making the Balloun, you must prepare strong Paper or Past board, and rowl it upon a wooden Rowler eight Inches in Circumference, or somewhat more, glewing it between every rowling, then choak the Cartoush at one of the ends, leaving a little hole for a port-fire, which must be of du∣rance by way of fuse till the Balloun can come to its height, which done, put in as many Serpents as the Cartoush will hold, and amongst them three or four Saucissions to break it, making them not to differ in length from the Serpents, fill them with the Composition of the Air Rockets, pressing the touch, if dry, strongly into the throats of each
of them, unless you make your fuse of Wild∣fire, and then it needs not, observing ever to let the necks of the Saucissions to be longer than those of the Serpents, that so they may all take fire before the Balloun is broken, and upon the Crown of each place a considerable number of either sort of Stars, and small quills of Brimstone-powder and Salt-peter, then choak the other end as strongly as may be, and prime it with stouple or Cotten∣week dipped in wet Powder, and afterward very well dryed again, and so having charged your Mortar or Past-board Gun, with the muzel mounted upwards, end it into the Air, and when it is at its height it will break, and present divers delightful Fi∣gures, representing sundry shapes and forms. Flying Saucissions are made as to the Car∣toush, in the manner of a ground Rocket, but the filling must be whole Powder, ex∣cept so much dust-Powder and Charcole as will serve for a port-fire till they can be de∣livered at their height in the Air, which must be done out of Past-board Guns set in a Row upon a bench or piece of Wood, and fired by a train underneath, and they will give reports in the Air like Muskets. The Guns must be made upon Rowlers of Wood, with strong Past-board about a foot and a half, or two foot in length,
worked in the rowling with Glew, or well made Past-board, and being corded over, they must be choaked with a strong Cord at one end, only leaving a small hole at the bottom to give fire; as for the bore of each it must be proportioned to the Sau∣cissions. If you would have Rockets run upon a Line backward and forward, you must choose a smooth and even line, and stripe. it over with Soap to make it run more glib, fasten two Rockets of the Composition of the Sky Rockets, head and tail, one on the one side, and the other on the other side of a small Cane, through which the Line must pass; so that when one is spent by running one way on the Line, the other may fire and come back again; and upon these you may place the forms of Dragons, Ships, or Men, which in the Night-time will appear dread∣ful to the Beholders. In case you are distressed for Match to use on these or the like Occasions, take hempen Cords that have not been pitched or dawbed with Tar, pull them to pieces, and then twist the loose stuff to the bigness of a mans Thumb, and boyl it in Wood-ly-ashes, ad∣ding a small quantity of Salt-peter until the Lye be consumed, then make it up, and draw it through your hand, holding part of
the pieces or remainder therein twice or thrice, and dry it in the Sun. Stopple or priming week is no other than Cotton-wool boiled in Water and Gun∣powder, and afterward dryed in the Sun, or by the Fire: And thus Reader I hope I have performed this undertaking to your Satisfaction. FINIS.
