A Covenant for RELIGION, KING, and COUNTREY, made by a new Ordinance of Counsail at the desire of the generall assem∣bly of SCOTLAND. WEall, and every one of us underwritten, protest that after long and due examination of our own consciences in matters of true, & false religion, are now throughly resolved of the truth by the word and Spirit of God; and therefore we beleeve with our hearts, confesse with our mouthes, subcribe with our hands, and constantly affirm before God, and the whole world: that this onely is the true Christian Faith, and Re∣ligion, pleasing God, and bringing salvation to man, which now is by the mercy of God revealed to the world by the preaching of the blessed Evangel: And received, beleived, and defended by many and sundry notable Kirks and Realms; but chiefely by the Kirk of Scotland, the Kings Majesty, and our Estates of this Realme, as Gods eternall truth and onely ground of our salvation; as more particularly is expressed in the Confession of our faithsta∣blished and confirmed by many Acts of Parliaments, and now of a long time hath been openly professed by the Kings Majesty, and whole body of his Realm, both in Burgh and Land. To the which Confession and forme of religion we willingly agree in our consciences in all points as unto Gods undoubted truth and verity, grounded only upon his written word: and therefore we abhorre and detest all contrary religion and doctrine: but chiefely all kinde of Papistry, in generall and particular heads, even as they are now damned & confuted by the word of God,
and Kirk of Scotland: but in especiall, we detest and refuse the usurped authority of that Romane Antichrist upon the Scriptures of God upon the Kirk, the civill Ma∣gistrate, and consciences of men, all his tyrannous lawes made upon indifferent things against our Chris∣tian liberty; his erroneous doctrine against the sufficien∣cy of the written word, and the perfection of the Law, the office of Christ and his blessed Evangel. His corrup∣ted doctrine concerning originall sin, our naturall ina∣bility and rebellion to Gods law, our justification by faith only, our imperfect sanctification and obedience to the Law, the nature, number, and use of the holy Sacra∣ments. His five bastard Sacraments, with all his rites, ce∣remonies, and false doctrine added to the ministration of the true Sacraments, without the word of God. His cruell judgement against infants departing without the Sacra∣ment, his absolute necessity of Baptisme, his blasphemous opinion of Transubstantiation, or reall presence of Christs body in the elements, and receiving of the same by the wicked or bodies of men; his dispensations with solemne Oathes, periuries, and degrees of marriage forbidden in the word, his cruelty against the innocent divorced, his devilish Masse, his blasphemous priesthood, his prophane Sacrifices for the sinnes of the dead and the quick, his Ca∣nonization of men calling upon Angels or Saints departed, worshipping of imagerie relicks, and crosses, dedicating of kirkes, Alters, dayes, vowes to creatures, his purgatory, prayers for the dead, praying or speaking in a strange lan∣guage, with his processions, and blasphemons lettany, and multitude of advocates or mediatours, his manifold or∣ders, auricular confession, his desperate and uncertain re∣pentance, his generall, and doubtsome faith, his satisfaction of men for their sins, his iustification by works, opus opera∣tum,
works of supererogation, merits, pardons, peregrina∣tions and stations, his holy water, baptizing of bells, conju∣ring of saints, crossing, fanning, anointing, coniuring, hal∣lowing of Gods good creatures with the superstitous opin∣ion, joyned there with his wordly Monarchy, and wicked Hierarcy, his three solemne vowes, with all his shavelings of sundry sorts, his erronious and bloody decrees made at Trent, with all the subscribers, & approvers of that cruell and bloody and band conjured against the Kirk of God; and finally we detest all vain allegories, rites, signes, and traditions, brought in the Kirk, without or against the word of God, and doctrine of this true reformed Kirk; to the which we joyne our selves willingly in doctrine, faith, religion, discipline, and use of the Holy Sacraments, as live∣ly members of the same in Christ our Head, prominsig and swering by the name of God our Lord, That we shall con∣tinue in the obedience of the doctrine and discipline of this Kirk, and shall defende the same according to our vocati∣on, all the dayes of our lives, under the paines contained in the law, and danger both of body and soule in the day of Gods fearefull Iudgements. And seeing that many are stir∣red up by Sathan, and that Roman Antichrist to promise, sweare, subscribe, and for a time use the holy Sacraments in the Kirk, deceitfull against their own consciences, min∣ding thereby first under the Externall cloak of religion, to corrupt and subvert secretly Gods true religion, within the Kirk; and afterward when time may serve to become open enemies and persecutors of the same, under vain hope of the Popes dispensation, devised against the word of God to his greater confusion, and their double condemnation in the day of the Lord Iesus Christ. We therefore willing to take away all suspition of hi∣pocrisie, and of such double dealing with God & his Kirk,
protest, and call the searcher of hearts for witnesse, that our minds and hearts do fully agree with this our Confession, Promise, Oath, and Subscription; so that we are not mo∣ved for any worldly respects, but are perswaded onely in our consciences through the knowledge & love of Gods true Religion printed in our hearts by the holy Spirit, as we shall answer to him, in the day when the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed: and because we perceive that the quietnesse and stability of our Religion and Kirk doth depend upon the safety and good behaviour of the Kings Majesty, as upon a comfortable instrument of Gods mer∣cy granted to this Countrey, for the maintaining of his Kirk, and ministration of justice amongst us; wee protest and promise with our hearts under the same oath, hand, writ, and pains, that we shall defend his royall person and authority, with our goods, bodies and lives, in the de∣fence of Christ his Evangel, Liberties of our countrey, mi∣nistration of justice, and punishment of iniquity, against all enemies within this Realm or without, as wee desire our God to be be a strong and mercifull defender to us in the day of our death, and comming of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom with the Father and the holy Spirit bee all honour and glory eternally.
A Worthy Speech spoken to the Kings most Excellent Majesty by the Recorder of Hereford. MOst gratious Soveraigne, according to our Allegiance wee are here assembled to entertaine your Majesty, and to give that welcome which shall become us your distressed Subjects, yet loyall liege-people. We with all joy acknowledge, that the Sunne never appeared more welcome to the halfe starved traveller, benum'd with the cold moysture of a hory morne, where the white dew like to con∣gealed Pearle hangs on his haire, (by which he dos appeare almost a frozen Statue,) then now your gratious presence is to us, almost despayring, frozen up with feare, with visible appearances of dan∣ger, death, and destruction, rapine, and thousands more calami∣ties, such, as will bring terrour in the meere relation. O my dread Soveraigne, let but your Servant put into your mind the dire effects of Warre, when flourishing Cities shall be turned to dust, nay this yet flourishing Kingdom shall become it's owne destroyer, buried in the tombe of blood and slaughter, when our young infants shall be rudely torne from the sad mothers, breast whose shrieks and cries serve as sad musique to the sacrifice, when our young virgins and our wives shall be subject to bloudy cruelty, when death shall triumph, and the friends of Rome, (whose only aymes are to destroy the Lawes, religion of the Kingdome, nay the King too, if not prevented) your selfe most gratious Sovraigne must suffer with your Subjects, if their hell-bred designes should ever take effect, therefore great King, now while you may, re∣turne, and joyne in peace with those, who like to teeming mothers long for your wished presence, or like to loving children, who fin∣ding the want of an indulgent parent, with an excessive sorrow mournes his absence, even so your Councell with an industrious care and loyall sorrow mourne for your sacred selfe, because your splendant favour hath been kept so long from shining on them,
their actions like to flowers in a dry sommer, want the dew of your high favour, which should make them flourish with natu∣rall sweetnesse, wherefore they are enforced to use sOme art to bring them to a growth, and make them usefull for the gene∣rall good, bu would you deigne to cast one splendant beame on their endeavours, and to lend a hand to raise their drooping hopes, then peace should flourish: those that seeke for war, should fall into that pit themselves have digged: O then Dread soveraigne abandon straight those Achans of the Land, let not atscintion or domestique strife revell within this Kingdame, but let peace, a bleffed reli∣gious peace be straight embraced, so shall your Crown and Throne endure for ever, and joy shall circumvent you, your Subjects feare shall cease, and you shall see, let Law have power who is an e∣nemy to Englands peace, and what they are that strive to ruine England could their Plots but thrive. I feare I have displeased (if not your Majestie, yet some of your retinue) which if I have, I must conclude that they are guilty of what I mention, for other∣wise what need they seeme offended at that which they are free of? As touching what Your Majesty shall command, we are ready to obey, so far as Law, or Religion will give way; but if any com∣mand shall happen contrary, our lives and fortunes shall be ex∣posed to the most eminent danger, in opposition of any such com∣mand. Thus trusting in Your Majesties Royall disposition, we rest, (according to our bounden duty) Your Majesties loyall and obedient Subjects, in which we are resolved to live and die. FINIS.
