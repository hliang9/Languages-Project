THese are to give Notice to all Ladys, and others, That Claudius Dupuys, in Long-Acre at the Sign of the Kings Arms, over against the Kings, Bagnio. He did last Sumâˆ£mer show Paterns for a Printer; but now he Prints himself, being he found out by his Ingenuity Collour beyond all other Printers, and more lasting and better gloss, without any ill smell, as others doth it; He Prints all sorts of Flowers or Birds, and Imitates the Indian Atlesses, or other Silk to great perfection. He hath great Variety of the newest Paterns in Gold or Silver, mixt with such Collour as the Ladys fancy; and will wash and bare any water without Deminishing his Collour, or properly equal to those that are wrought with a Loome, Needle, or by other arts or means, and all together as durable and lasting, for no water will alter the Collour of it. He Prints upon all sorts of Silk or Stuff New or Old, the new will show as well and as Rich as Imbrodery doth, and the Old will look new again, and the like for Ribon and Stomacher for Stays to Imitate any Triming. He likewise stains all manner of Silk, and Prints all sorts of Cllico and Lining, with such lively Collour in various Figures, that no washing can Impare. He sells several other Curiosities at Reasonable Rates.
