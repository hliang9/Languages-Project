The Copy of a LETTER FROM APPLEBEY-CASTLE. Right Honourable, AFter Colonell Generall Ashton had relieved Cockermouth Castle with the Lancashire forces, The English Horse would have entred Carlisle, but were not permitted by those that were there before, where upon some of them dis∣persed
severall wayes, and the body of the Cavalry marched hither to Appleby, whither Col. Gen. Ashton came against them, And found about 1000 besides the Garrison Soul∣diers. They had 1200 Horse, but our Souldi∣ers bought most of them at small rates before the surrender, which was after made, The particulars whereof was thus. Col. Gen. Ashton sent a Summons for them to be all prisoners at mercy, and surrender their Armes to the Parliament, with Appleby Castle, and all the Armes and Ammunition. This occasioned some overtures for surren∣der thereof, which was done with speed. And Saturday October 7 all things were concluded betweene them. The termes were, For the inferiour Offi∣cers and Common-Souldiers to goe home, lay downe their Armes and be quiet, and ob∣serve all Orders and Ordinances of Parlia∣ment, and Sir Philip Musgrave, Sir Thomas Til∣sley, Sir Robert Strickeland, Sir William Hud∣dleston, and the rest of the Officers to goe be∣yond the Seas, And to have 6 months allow∣ed to stay and provide for their going, except
the Parliament shall in the interim doe any thing in their behalfe, They to observe all Orders, and Ordinances of Parliament, which if they doe not, then to have no bene∣fit of the Articles, and to be at the Parlia∣ments mercy. I have sent you herewith a List of the Of∣ficers, and also a List of the Ordnance, Horse and Armes. On Munday Oct. 9. they deliver∣ed the Castle, and surrendred their Horses and Armes that were left, most of which they had sold before, and so the number surrend∣red was but smal, save only 500 foot Arms in the Castle, But however (though the Souldi∣ers paid a smal matter for them, and indeed it was but small, yet) wee have 1200 of their Horse.
