Sorrovvfull Verses made on  death of our most Soueraigne Lady Queene ELIZABETH, my Gracious Mistresse. ENGLAND may mourne, as many Kingdomes way A losse of late, that Gold nor Pearle redeemes, A gale of winde, that made Kings hoyse vp Sayles, When blustring blasts, brought Barkes in great extreeme Her Realme shee rul'de, and bridled as GOD would, With Reasons raine, that holds backe Bayards bit, To purchase peace, payd massie summes of Gold, Did what  might, to win a world with wit, Wised ules Starres, clymes vp to Heauens gate, Makes Peace and Warres, and stayes a tottering State, Her insight saw, all outward flawes of winde, Her iudgement crept, into our cunning Age, No practize could, surpasse her Princely minde, Her calmie wordes, could swelling Sea asswage, Religion burnd, like Lampe in her bare brest, And for her faith, shee still set vp her rest, Shee gaue great things to thousands, world well knowes, As at well head, and Fountaine Water flowes. Caesars, sharpe Spirit, her speeches vttr'ed oft, Cyrus great power, and wealth she wanted not, Shee pluc't downe Pride, to set meeke hearts aloft, Her matchles deedes, great Fame and Glorie got, Opened her bagges, to such as suffered wrong, Much money lent, but felt the losse to long. Escap't bad men, that sought to shed her blood, Forgaue great faultes, to winne worldes loue and zeale: But when most safe, in health we thought shee stood, Her Ghost past hence, (from Crowne and Common-weale) To GODS high Throne, like Torch and Candle blaze, (Lost earthly light) and left vs in a maze. FINIS. T. Church-yard Esqu This Phoenix dead, from her warme Cynders streight, Informe of Man, another Phoenix rose, Who clapt his wings, And flew vp such a height, (So neere the Sunne) that he GODS glorie showes.
