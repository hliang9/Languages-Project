To his Excellency the Lord Fleetwood, and the General Council of Officers of the Army. The Humble Address of the now Com∣mission Officers and private Souldiers of Major Gen. Goffs Regiment (so called) of Foot. Most Humbly presented under these following Heads. 1. THat what Persons soever that have Com∣mand in Major Gen. Goffs Regiment, who ever willingly deserted their Appearances for the Good Old Cause on the last occasion, we desire they may bear no Command in the Army, and that all such Officers as were put in by Major Gen. Goffe, and are of his Relations, who never fought with us in the late Wars, may be forth-with dismissed. 2. That whatsoever Commission Officers in the Regiment, that hath formerly born Arms in the late Kings Party may speedily be discharged his Imploy∣ment, that have not been eminently known in this Last Trial. 3. As we have alwaies owned and adventured For the Good Old Cause, so we are resolved to stand for, and maintain it to the Effusion of out blood, and to the pulling down any Arbitrary power shall oppose it. 4. That as God hath been pleased to stir up the faithful of the Army to a serious Consideration of
this our present Condition; so we desire incourage∣ment from them to uphold that just and lawful enter∣prize by us begun. 5. That whereas the Late Lord PROTECTOR hath cast out several faithful and honest Officers, who have been well known to us, and experienced so by us; we desire their Restitution to their places, and to be im∣powred again amongst us. 6. And because we are in an unsetled Condition; we desire the Good Old Parliament to be again called for the Reparation of our Breaches so well known to them; and that a present order might be issued out for their assembling, the which we rather pray because we have had experience of their faithful service for the general good of the Nation.
