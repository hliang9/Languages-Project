And that the OATH of Allegiance is due to Their most Serene Majesties, the present King and Queen, Notwithstanding any former Oath made to the late King. Licens'd according to Order.

A LETTER TO A MEMBER OF THE High and Honble Court of Parliament, &c. SIR, IN Obedience to your Command, in this wonderful Jun∣cture of time, wherein the late unfortunate King having Relinquished his Throne, as Conscious to himself of a Mal Governo; and Their most August Majesties, by God's Mercy, being most auspiciously setled in the Imperial Crown, I take the Boldness to present you with this Paper, gi∣ving you a small rough draught of the Nature and several Mo∣dels of Government in a general Notion; and more particu∣larly of the most excellent Constitution of Parliaments, in which, after some sort, all Governments are comprised, and bow at this miraculuos Change. This Parliament hath been managed with the greatest Prudence and Advantage to the Nation, by the unanimous Concurrence of both Houses, who have enacted such
good Laws, by the Direction of His most Sacred Majesty, for the Glory of God, and the Preservation of the Church of Eng∣land, (as by Law established,) and of Their Majesties most Royal Persons, and Government, and Kingdoms. I most humbly crave your Pardon for my great Freedom in presenting you, as my worthy Trustee, with my meaner Senti∣ments, not any way presuming to speak my Dictates, but my most humble Address, which I submit to your more mature Judgment. All Governments (consisting in the due Administration of Justice, and the Subordination and Obedience of inferior Per∣sons to Superior, till we come to a Supreme Power,) are of Di∣vine Institution, as derived from God, Himself, the Fountain of all Power and Authority, commanding Reverence and Obedi∣ence to the Sanctions and Persons of Governors, who are more or less God's Vicegerents, as they are invested with more or less Power. Whereupon they being in some sort Particles of the Divine Nature, or styled Gods in Holy Writ, in reference to their Royal Functions of their remunerative and vindicative Justice. And it were to be heartily wished and prayed for, that all Gover∣nors, and especially the Supreme Power in all Nations, may truly so participate of the Divine Nature, that they may be like God in those most excellent Characters of Sanctity and Power, to influence, as well the Souls with virtuous and pious Inclinati∣ons, as to command the Bodies of others by coercive Laws. The Supreme Power hath divers Qualifications; and is found∣ed in one in Monarchy, in the best in Aristocracy, and in the People in Democracy, which is the worst or most near to Anar∣chy and Confusion: And therefore Monarchy is judged the best, as it hath most of Unity in it, because all Subjects unite in one King, as all Members in one Head, or as Lines in one common Center: And Aristocracy is of a middle Nature, more degenerate than Monarchy, in that it consisteth of many Governors; and more exalted than Democracy, because it is framed of the best. And these being premised, I beg the favour to speak my own Sense, which (as I conceive) is that of our own Nation, that Parliamentary Government is the best Constitution of all, be∣cause
in it, all these are comprised in the King, and His Majesties Two Houses of Parliament as His Great Council: First, the Government is constituted in the King as Supreme, and so it is Monarchical: Secondly, in the Lords, as His greatest Ministers; and so in some degree the Government may be styled Aristocra∣tical: Thirdly, it is seated in the House of Commons, as the Representatives of the People; and so the Parliamentary Go∣vernment, in some manner, may be called Democratical. Whereupon this kind of Government being united in the King, as the Head and Fountain of it, is most excellent and Satisfactory, because all Interests having a share in Government, as they are concerned in the Legislative Power, can give such an Account of, and make such an Inspection into the general Grievances of the Nation, and rectifie them by making such sober Debates, and by deliberate Councils, in the matter of wholesom Laws, which being stated, or made first Bills by the Approbation of both Houses, and are afterwards recommended to Their Majesties for Their Royal Assent, as the Essence of the Law. The Bills of the Lords and Commons being only prepa∣ratory, as giving the rough draught of Laws, which are after∣wards finished, as receiving their Form, Birth and Life, from Their Majesties Royal Signature. Wherefore the Lords and Commons do deem it most just and equitable to pay their Duty and Reverence to Their Majesties, as the Supreme Powers, who have again frequently condescend∣ed, out of Their Royal Inclinations to do good to Their People, to speak Their Returns in Gracious Concessions, to gratifie the just Designs of both Houses, who, I hope, will endeavour, by all means possible, to approve themselves True Sons of the Protestant Church, in being Pious to God, Loyal to Their Ma∣jesties, and just to their Trust reposed in them, in the mainte∣nance of the truly Ancient Reformed Religion of the Church of England, as the most excellent for Purity of Doctrine according to Holy Writ; and for Uniformity in Discipline as now esta∣blish'd by Law, according to the Practice of the Primitive Church, under which the Church of England hath been rendred most happy (even to the Admiration, if not the Envy, of other Reformed Churches,) in the Reigns of King Edward VI. Queen
Elizabeth, King James, King Charles I. and II. of Blessed Me∣mory; and, I hope, it will long continue flourishing for many years under the Protection of our now Gracious Sovereigns King William and Queen Mary, as assisted with the Wise, Peace∣able, and Healing Councils of the Lords and Commons now as∣sembled in this Parliament, which I shall pray may be made ef∣fectual, by many wholesom Applications, to heal this distra∣cted and bleeding State and Church, which must be bound up by skilful and tender Hands; lest the Wounds grow wider by their roughness, and by unexperienced Medicines, which, if improperly applied, will prove destructive to the Ancient and well approved Constitutions of the Church and Kingdom, as now by Law established. At this Juncture of time it is humbly conceived to be very dangerous to raise Disputes concerning the Secular and Eccle∣siastical Polity, which is the same or at least the nearest to that, immediately succeeding the Holy Apostles. And I deem it also very unreasonable and of ill Consequence to charge the Human frailties of the Governors upon the Go∣vernment it self; if this Argument were good, a subversion (which God forbid) might be attempted upon the most Excel∣lent Constitution of Monarchy and Episcopacy, the Pillars, by which the Peace and Happiness of the Kingdom are sup∣ported in the Civil and Ecclesiastical Government. Nay if it be lawful to take away the Use for the Abuse of things, Chri∣stianity it self, and its most holy Ordinances, instituted by our Blessed Saviour, may be abolished, if the great Immorality and Impiety of the Prophane Atheistical Professors should be im∣puted to that most Holy and Divine Profession. And it is very much hoped and earnestly prayed for, that Their Majesties and both Houses would be graciously pleased unanimously to join together in a well tempered Zeal acted with Knowledge and Meekness to preserve this once flourishing Church and Kingdom, (till the late Kings Reign) in labouring with all might and main to oppose and countermand, through Gods great Power and Grace, Hell and Rome, the Devil and the Jesuits, and their Party; in order to maintain the Purity of Religion in the true Profession of Christs Holy Doctrine and
Ordinances, instituted by Him and His Apostles, and revealed in Holy Scripture. And to Enact such sound and effectual Laws to corroborate and reinforce, by reducing into Execution those former most Excellent Sanctions of Parliaments, and where they are deficient, to make a suppliment of one or more well digested new ones to render the Popish Recusants Convict. Having presumed to give you a brief account, as preliminary to a farther Discourse, of the nature and fundamental Constitu∣tion of the Government and Legislative Power of this Nation, and that the Supreme is not Despotical and Arbitrary at the will only of the Prince, but limited and moderated by many Established Laws tending to the preservation of the Religion and Property of the People. Whereupon I most humbly conceive it may be reasonably in∣ferred that the Law of Nature is the Supreme upon Earth, and the end of all Government is the preservation and well-being of the People, and this late Prince, how absolute and great soever he deemed himself, having by a Dispensing Power nul∣led and abrogated the Laws, contrary to his Promise and Oath, (which were most Obligatory and Solemn in order to his being proclaimed and Crowned King) and hath entred into Alliance with a Neighbouring King to bring in a Foreign Army, and modelled his own by turning out his Protestant Officers, and bringing in Romanists, and by calling in the Barbarous Irish in∣to England, who can imagine but he intended to enslave his Sub∣jects, and set up Popery, and destroy the holy Church of Eng∣land; whereupon he Closetted many Persons of Honour and Quality, (it being an action below a Prince) courting some by fair promises, and menacing others to the loss of their Offices, if they did not comply with his Arbitrary design to settle them in a Parliamentary way; but not being able so far to debauch these Patriots of their Country, as to make them quit their Principles of Honour and Honesty, by an unreasonable submis∣sion to his absolute and meaner Will: This late King by the advice of his Jesuits, (as little versed in true Politicks, as soud Learning) did attempt another way of being Master of his Ends, by Commanding the Corporate Towns and Cities to give
up their Ancient Charters, and receive new ones from him, wherein the Election of Parliament Men was committed to a few Popish, or ill persons disaffected to Government, to take off the Test and Penal Laws, the Walls and Bulwarks of our Religion and Properties. And his Protestant Subjects having proclaimed and Crowned him King, he did notwithstanding ex∣ercise an Arbitrary Power over them, to the subversion of the fundamental Laws, and the destruction of Religion and Pro∣perty, and to that end, he turned out of Command many Pro∣testant Officers in England, and all in Ireland; and having been assisted by the French King with Ships, Men, and Money, went from France to his Irish Army, and hanged up divers Protestants, who only defended themselves against the Insolency and Oppres∣sion of the Papists; And in requital of the Protestants Loyalty in proclaiming him King, hath given their Estates by Patents to the Papists, contrary to the Declaration of Indulgence, and many Acts of Parliament: And it is believed by many Wise Men, That the late King hath given or Morgaged the Kingdom of Ireland to the French King, as having put the Irish Army, Garisons, and Forts into the hands of French Commanders and Governors, and himself under a Tutor, disposing of him, whereby in truth he hath enslaved himself, though he may fond∣ly fancy thereby to regain his Arbitrary Power, and be in a capacity to trample upon the Necks, and Tyrannize over the Religion, Lives and Fortunes of the Protestants, inhabiting his late Kingdoms. And can any sober Man, after such an ill Administration of Government, be so void of Sense and Reason as to cancel the Law of Nature, as being wanting to himself in common Prudence, as not to preserve himself, and to be so passive in an unnatural obedience to an unlimited Power, as to be guilty of self Murder, in which he is so tame, as to suffer his Throat to be cut without making any lawful Defence, which God and Nature have provided in great Extremities. In the vacancy of a Supreme Governor, the next Powers in degree have a Commission granted them from God and Nature to supply the defect of Government, and the People are bound to obey their Commands as most authentick and legal in this great and indispensable Case of Necessity, in which the People
must engage each other, and stand by the Magnates of the King∣dom with their Lives and Fortunes; and though this Assertion seems not to comply with the Letter of the Law in the most high and severe rigor of it, yet the seeming illegality is justified by an utmost Extremity, in which the Supreme Power being deficient, all the subordinate Powers are obliged so far as they can by all possile means, to preserve each other: Let us con∣sider and admire the Wise Aconomy of Nature, whose parts are so well disposed by an Essential Wisdom, in so excellent a frame and order, that upon most urgent occasions they use their utmost endeavours for a mutual preservation, whereupon peculiar Bo∣dies move contrary to their natural and private Inclinations, heavy things moving upward, and light pressing downward, to preserve the wellfare of the Universe in securing its continued order from all confusion and vacuity. Upon the great emergency of the vacancy of the Throne, his late Majesty having deserted the Crown, and left the Nation in great confusion without deputing any Person to govern, it necessarily fell upon the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, the Peers of the Nation, to supply the defect of the Government, who devolved the Administration of Justice upon the next Heir Male of the Royal Line, an Illustrious Prince of the greatest Honour, Prudence, and Vertue imaginable, to whom the whole Nation is most highly obliged, under God, as their great De∣liverer, where his Highness most eminently hazarded his own Life and Fortunes, to redeem ours; and if we do not pay a Duty of Obedience and Gratitude to him, we shall most justly incur the heavy displeasure of God. This most Heroick Prince hath performed his Trust in the most faithful and prudent Admi∣nistration of Justice, and called a free Convention of Lords and Commons, which by his Kingly Power were afterwards Constituted a Parliament, (sincerely espousing the Interest of the People) who have prepared many excellent Bills, which have been deemed worthy to be Enacted into Laws by their Majesties Royal Assent. This August King out of his Royal Condescention hath so far indulged his Parliament, as in all his important Concerns to desire their Advice and Approbation, which shews his great
Complaisance and entire Affection for his People. And we are bound in all Reason to speak our Dutiful returns of Obedience and Gratitude to support his Imperial Crown and Dignity (which is our Interest as well as Duty) with our Lives and For∣tunes in opposition to any power whatsoever. And seeing we have received so great, and never to be for∣gotten an Obligation from the High and Mighty States of the United Provinces of the Low-Countreys (whom God preserve) in furnishing the most Serene Prince of Orange with Ships, Men, and Money, to Relieve us in our great Extremity, we are bound upon all Occasions to speak our most grateful Returns to them, when they shall signifie to us their desire of our Assistance. Let us admire and adore that infinite Wise, powerful and good God, that hath employed many of his Divine Attributes to preserve this Nation, laden with Sin and Iniquity, (who de∣serve nothing but Vengeance and Destruction) and hath made our Gracious King a most happy and glorious Instrument of our Deliverance, and when we were near death and desolation, gasping and ready to give up the Ghost, his Majesty hath by his most seasonable and solutary Endeavours restored us to life, praised and magnified be Gods most glorious Name for ever, for his most unspeakable Mercies, as being more gracious to us, then all the Nations of the Earth. Let us therefore shew our selves sincerely thankful in our obedience to his Divine Laws, in conforming our selves to the holy Precepts and Ex∣ample of our great Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, Blessed for ever. And our Noble King as great in Goodness as Glory, out of most generous Principles to love Mankind, is not active only to preserve his own Kingdoms, but the whole Christian World, and done our Nation much Honour and Justice in making good the Treaty of Nimeguen, and in breaking the Alliance between the late King and France, hath endeavoured to secure a Universal Peace in Christendom, and to preserve the holy Church of England. (the best of Churches) and the Protestant Religion and Interest through the whole World. And whosoever hath not most Loyal and Reverential esteem for this Superlative Person of Highest Honour, upon whom so
many Divine Characters are most eminently imprinted, seemeth to be out of love with Gods Image, and the Divine Nature, with Vertue and Goodness it self. And notwithstanding all those high Obligations conferred upon us, some of us so much forget our selves in not remem∣bring our Duty of Thankfulness to God and Man, that we grow sower and bitter in our narrow and peevish Principles, and as much as in us lieth blast the hopeful Effects of our Deliverers Endeavours, and out of a sick Hypocondraiacal and Phanatick Humour have degenerate and vitiated Palates in loving the Gar∣lick, Onions, and Flesh Pots of Egypt; and seem to disown Gods Gracious Dispensations of his Providence, that they frown, when after so many Storms he smiles in fair Weather, wherein we may promise our selves Halcyon days of joy and happiness. And when God hath been pleased to preserve us in so many great Tempests, (threatning a Shipwrack of our holy Church, and Excellent Government in State) he hath most graciously brought us to a safe Harbour, wherein we were universally united in giving God thanks for his Miraculous and Merciful Deliverance of us out of the Jaws of Death and Destruction, yet now we turn and grow so stupid, and unthankful, as to di∣vide again about the methods of securing our Peace, that we seem to kick and bogle at the most gracious and salutary Dis∣pensations of his Providence, which should (seeing it is the Lords doing, and marvellous in our Eyes) make us in love with God, and the happy and worthy Instruments of our great De∣liverance beyond all hope and expectation. We all agreed in a common Consent, that the late King being weary of his Administration (as his Army having deserted him) Abdicated his Government, and left us in great confusion, without a Deputation of any Person to supply his place; where∣upon the Throne became vacant: And the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, in this great Exigency, thought it as well lawful as necessary in point of Prudence and Gratitude, to desire the Prince (as a great Instrument of our Preservation) to accept the Su∣preme Administration, as most fit for it. And it was generally deemed by the Nobility and other Persons of Honour, necessary
for a further settlement, that the Prince of Orange should call a Convention of Lords and Commons, (as next akin to a Parlia∣ment) which was done accordingly by Circular Letters, only different in a punctilio from Writs, which could not be observed in this Juncture; whereupon the Members of the House of Commons were as unanimously and duly Elected, as in any Par∣liament whatsoever. Now since all the People (whose preservation is the end of Government) did virtually or actually choose their Representa∣tives, as their Trustees, or the Peers, the greatest Persons of Honour (the late King having deserted his Government) did sit in their own Right; so that all Persons, of what degree soever, did refer the Election of a Supreme Power to the determination of a Convention, and are in all reason and equity obliged to sub∣mit to the Major Vote of this Assembly, as Judges of their own choosing. And seeing divers People have various sentiments, as well as faces, in point of the best settlement of Government, we must determine, that the best way of ending our differences, is to leave it to our Trustees, as the most proper Arbitrators to adjust our different Proposals, else every Party so much abounding in their own sense, must render us liable to eternal Disputes, without a greneral Agreement in any one setled Government. Some were for recalling King James, and bringing up the Prince of Wales (as his Successor) in the holy Faith of the Church of England; others for a Regent invested with Kingly Power; some for Crowning the Prince of Orange alone; and others for Crowning the Princess alone; some for Aristocracy, and others for e∣mocracy. Whereupon I most humbly conceive it most reasonable to be∣lieve (that when we are perplexed in such variety of Opinions, tending to Anarchy and the destruction of the Kingdom) that a Convention (in whom the Body of the Nation agreeth) as their own choice, and as Wise and Honest Men, (many of them being long experienced in Parliamentary Affairs) they are the most proper Expedients to settle us in our distracted Condition, and have accordingly proclaimed the most illustrious Prince and Princess King and Queen, to the great satisfaction of the greatest
part of the Nation; And all discontented People ought to ac∣quiesce in the prudent Councils and determination of the Com∣mons (with the Concurrence of the Lords) as being true Re∣presentatives and Trustees, advancing the welfare and prospe∣rity of the Kingdom. But it may be objected by some dissatisfied Persons, that out of a tenderness of Conscience they cannot pay Allegiance to the present King, as altering the Succession, and injuring the Title of the two Princesses. To which I take the boldness to give this Reply, That the Princess of Orange, who on all sides hath an indisputable Title of being right Heir to the Crown, is put into possession, and all Acts of Parliament are Enacted by her Royal Signature; And out of her entire Love to the Prince and the Kingdom, hath in great Modesty and Prudence, in this great emergency and perplexity of Affairs, conceived her self less capable to Conduct the Supreme Administration alone, whereupon by the Approbation of her self and Sister, the Princess Anne, the Prince was deemed fit by the Convention to be joined with the Princess in the Title and Supreme Power for his Life only. Now seeing it was designed by divers Republicans to alter the Constitution of Government, the two Princesses acted like themselves in great prudence to concur with the Convention, whereby they defeated the Enemies to Monarchy, and gave great satisfaction to the Kingdom in approving the Prince to be Elected King, as an Illustrious Person, the next Heir Male of the Royal Line, qualified with great perfections, rendring him most fit for this Kingly Office; And indeed we had been wanting to our selves, as well as to the Prince in justice and gratitude, if we had not petitioned him to accept of the vacant Throne, as due to him so near akin to the Crown, for his great Merit as our De∣liverer in the time of trouble, wherein he most seasonably re∣deemed the Nation from Arbitrary Power, threatning the utter subversion of the Laws, the destruction of our Religion, Pro∣perty, Lives, and Fortunes. And this case (which was necessary in this Emergency) is not like to happen as long as the World shall last, and being but one Example, cannot be made a precedent, except the same Cir∣cumstances
occur, (which is most improbable, and never like to come to pass again;) and seeing it is only for his Life, if he do not outlive his Queen, it cannot at all be prejudicial to Princess Anne; and after his Death (which God long avert) the Go∣vernment will return to the ancient Current. And I humbly conceive the Act of a former Convention to be less consistent with Reason, (as a worthy Person hath lately observed) That while the Lady Elizabeth, the true Heir of the Crown, was li∣ving, declared Henry the Seventh to be King, without joining her in the Title, or making any mention of her Right, yet not∣withstanding this all the Kingdom bare Allegiance to this King de facto, before he confirmed his Title to the Crown by Marry∣ing the Lady Elizabeth, the true Heir; and Henry the Seventh to this day is acknowledged a lawful King, and his Acts of Parlia∣ment are not repealed by any subsequent Parliaments, and one of his Statutes is yet in force, That one who is King de facto, is to be obeyed; But here the Case is different, wherein the Heir, who hath an unquestionable right to the Crown, is declared Queen, and the Prince being of the Blood Royal, having a Title too, (though not immediate) is declared King by the Lords and Commons, as most able to assist the Queen, his glorious Spouse, who is less fit for the sole Administration, when the Government is perplexed with so many difficulties in this sad juncture of Affairs, wherein many Divisions are sprung up among us upon nice Punctilio's, which I hope a small time, and more rectified apprehensions of things will solve; especially when we consider we ought to unite in a common Allegiance due to our Heroick King, our Noble Patron, great Benefactor, and most Indulgent Father of our Country; that we may shut up the Door against Popery and Slavery, which our discontents may introduce, if we do not prevent the pernicious designs of our Enemies by making up the Breaches, (which else will expose us to ruine and destruction) by complying with the King, Lords, and Commons in their just Commands. Another Query is propounded by dissatisfied Persons, That they have Sworn Allegiance to King James, his lawful Heirs and Successors, and that no Power on Earth can absolve them; so that they are in no legal capacity to transfer their Allegiance
to the present King: To which I take the boldness to make this Reply, That Allegiance cannot be, in a Political sense, an ob∣ligation of Duty from a Subject to a King, in which the Ratio formalit; of Allegiance is not an Extrinsecal Denomination, or Notional Being, but a Modification of something real, founded in a Relation, interceding two real Terms, and in our present or particular apprehension is a habitude referring to a King and his People, which imports a mutual respect between two Rela∣tives, of which if one of them cease, the Relation ends and be∣comes void; whereupon a King having forfeited his Crown (as some will have it resonable) in the breach of his Faith, and Co∣ronation Oath by setting up an Arbitrary Power dispensing with the Laws, (whereby he subverted the fundamental Laws of the Kingdom) loseth his Kingly Power and Dignity, as destroying those fundamental Constitutions upon which his own Right to the Crown was superstructed, and these Premises being granted, his Kingly Office is laid aside, and we are no more his Subjects, and by consequence no Allegiance due to him. This Position seems to be backed by the Precedents of former Ages, by a Law made in King Edward the Confessers Reign, declaring, That if a King doth not perform his Office, he shall not so much as retain the name of a King. And Sigisberte King of the West Saxons being guilty of high Arrogance and Wicked∣ness, was driven out of his Kingdom by the Nobles and whole People of the Kingdom assembled together. King John having violated his Coronation Oath, and sub∣verted the fundamental Laws of the Kingdom, and many ways endeavouring to destroy the Church and State, it was agreed, That the Barons should be absolved from their Allegiance to him; and he was adjudged in a general Assembly to be unworthy of the Kingly Office. King Edward the Second, treading in the steps of the former Kings, received the same punishment, as being Proud and Arro∣gant, and breaking his Faith in not observing his Coronation Oath, and wasting the Treasure of the Kingdom, was by the advice of the Prelates, Earls and Barons, and the Commons of the Kingdom, deposed from the Government.
I will trouble you only with one Example more of King Ri∣chard the Second, who refused to be Governed by the Laws, Statutes, and Lawdable Ordinances of the Realm, and by the Advice of the Lords and great Men of the Kingdom, it was found by an ancient Statute lawful for them with the common assent and consent of the People of the Realm, to depose the said King from his Regal Throne, and to set up one (in his place) of the Royal Family. So that these Examples ought to be prevalent to convince us, as being the practises of the Ancients, who Judged Kings to be set up for Government according to Law, and in Mal Admini∣stration, it being Arbitrary, and inconsistent with the welfare of the People, the ends of Government ceasing. The Gover∣nors may be well laid aside, as cancelling the Law of Nature, which is the preservation of the Commonwealth committed to their Charge. But if these Arguments be not satisfactory, I will make bold to propound one more, which is undeniable, That King James hath voluntarily Deposed himself, as deserting his Government, (and carrying away the Great Seal, and cancelling the Writs of Parliament) without substituting any to Govern in his stead as his Commissioner or Deputy; whereupon in this great Exigency the Kingdom was exposed to Confusion and Anarchy, the An∣tecedent of Ruin and Destruction, had it not been wisely pre∣vented first by the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and afterward by the Lords and Commons, (the late King being dead, if not in a Natural, yet in his Politick Capacity) to give a due Re∣ception of the most Illustrious Prince and Princess of Orange, to be our King and Queen, to whom appertained a right of Inhe∣ritance, and as Persons of greatest Merits and Perfections im∣maginable; whereupon without dispute, we ought to pay all our Duty and Allegiance to Their Majesties, as to our most Lawful and Supreme Governors. If any discontented Person shall pretend out of a tender Compassion to the late King, that he is severely treated, and did not relinquish his Throne, but was forced to leave it by the desire of the present King; it may be answered, That he out of his own resolution, quitted London first, and being brought
back, he was attended by a numerous Company of Papists at Whitehall, to the great disturbance of the City and Kingdom, whereupon the Glorious Prince of Orange made an Address to His late Majesty, by the Advice of the Lords, not to depart the Kingdom, but to withdraw himself only Ten Miles from His Palace, which he refused, and took his own Measures, and went to Rochester, as a place very advantageous to Embark for France, (to follow his Queen according to his promise) which he did accordingly, and hath made himself a Royal Prisoner to the French King, and since been furnished by him with Ships, Men, and Money for Ireland, and hath put that Kingdom into his Hands, to promote the French Interest, to divert us from fighting against him, and to make us Slaves; at last, if the French King can succeed in his Pernicious Designs, to destroy Their present Majesties, and our holy Church and Kingdom: So that we are now in no obligation to pay any Obedience to the late King, as having left his Throne, and espoused the French Interest, and never like to return to us unless with the destru∣ction of his late three Kingdoms; wherefore it is most just and equitable to Swear Allegiance to the most August King and Queen, as Legitimate Heirs to the Crown. And Christ, the most just and Holy Lawgiver, having com∣manded us to render to Caesar the things that are Caesars, let us pay the King the Tribute of our Fortunes, it being our Interest as well as Duty, to support his State, and our selves in his Go∣vernment; and that he bear not his Sword in vain, let us strengthen his Arm, and render him able to protect us in our Extremity; let us therefore give His Majesty with Loyal Hearts and open Hands such Supplies that are suitable to His just and great Occasions, that he may be made capable to defend the true Catholick Church and Faith, Their Royal Persons and Authority, and the Laws and Liberties of the People com∣mitted to their Charge, in opposition to all Domestick and Foreign Enemies, who threaten an utter ruine to the holy Church of England, (and Protestant Religion) as now esta∣blished by Law, and a final desolation to the whole King∣dom.
And according to his holy Precept, above all, let us render to God the things that are Gods, that his Glory may be de∣clared by us, in the Adoration of his most holy Attributes, and in Obedience to his most sacred Commands; which, that they may be most religiously observed, let such Penal Laws be Enacted or brought into Execution, which concern the strict Ob∣servance of the Lords-Day, and such due severe Punishments may be inflicted upon Irreligious and Prophane Debauches for Blasphemy, Atheism, Swearing, Perjury, Drunkenness, Whore∣dom, and other reigning Sins of our Nation, that God out of his infinite Mercy would pardon our Enormous Sins and Trans∣gressions, and therein bless Their Majesties, and their great Council of Parliament, and all the People committed to their Care and Protection, that God's most Sacred Name may be ever glorified, and that their most Serene Majesties may out∣shine all their Ancestors in all Christian Graces, and in a long and Prosperous Reign here, and in Eternal Glory in the World to come. FINIS.
