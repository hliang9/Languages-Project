TO THE King's Most Excellent MAJESTY WILLIAM III. King of Great Britain, France and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, &c. Great SIR, THE Dedication of this following History of the Turks, may most justly be Addressed to the Clemency and Patronage of Your Majesty for Two Reasons. First, Because the greatest Part of this Treatise was Written at Ham∣burg, whilst I was actually employed for the space al∣most of Eleven Years in the Service of Your Majesty, the which, I hope will not be looked upon as a Point of my Demerit, or Neglect in my Duty, to have taken out so many Hours as this Work might Require from the Service of Your Majesty. For I can safely say, and that Your Majesty's Secretaries also in England, and Abroad, can Attest for me, that I have been diligent in my Office, and have neglected nothing therein, which my Duty and Services to Your Majesty might require, and expect from me; for it was Written at my Vacant Hours, when nothing of my other Services could give me the least Avocation. But what may chiefly oblige me farther to this De∣dication, is the Healing, Powerful, and Successful Hand which Your Majesty hath Applied by Your Ambassa∣dors, in making that Peace at Carlowitz, between the Christians and the Turks, which will ever be remembred in Future Ages, and which (as Your former Actions shewed the World You were a great Captain in the Arts of
War) so this will give good Proof You were a Wise and Prudent Governor in the Exercises of Peace; And may deserve to have that Motto inserted in Your Escocheon, Beati sunt Pacifici. And so may Your Majesty be always Blessed and Prosperous in this Life, and Your Great Good Works Rewarded in Heaven. Which are the most Devout Prayers of Your MAJESTY's Most Obedient Subject, and most Humble, Devoted, and Dutiful Servant, Paul Rycaut. Hamburgh Jan 15. 1700.
THE PREFACE TO THE READER. Courteous Reader, I Would not have Thee entertain a worse Opinion of this History, by Reason of the Place where it was Wrote and Finished, being at a far distance both from Constantinople and Vienna: Though perhaps it might have been more lively, had its Colours been laid on in the Places themselves, where the Actions were performed; and at a time when the Humour of the Turks, and the Idea I conceived of their Actings, had taken so strong an Impression in my Mind, that whilst I was upon the Place, I could suffer nothing to pass my Pen, without its due Observation. Being thus accustomed to such Contem∣plations as these, in my more Youthful Days, I could not let pass the continual News, and the constant Intelligences I received from Hun∣gary, and other Parts which were the Seats of War between the Chri∣stians and the Turks, without making some Reflections thereupon.
After which, I might justly challenge the Privilege of an Exaucto∣rate, or of a Miles Emeritus: And I think I need not Blot any more Paper for the future on any Subject relating to the Turks; for having arrived, at that great Period of the last Wars, concluded between the Emperor of Germany, and all his Allies against the Turks; It may appear how much the Ottoman Force is able to avail, when it is put into the Scale and Ballance against all Christendom. It hath been an ancient Custom, and Policy amongst the Turks, in the time of their prosperous Successes by which their Empire was enlarged, never to continue a War longer than for three Years, in which time they always advanced considerably, and would make no Peace with their Neighbours, until their Triumphs and Acquisitions would answer the expences, and effusions of their Blood, and Trea∣sures: After which they commonly fixed Twenty Years for the Settle∣ment, and Security of those new Conquests and Plantations; in which time many young Soldiers being Born and Bred up in Arms, they not only took those Habitations for their Native Soil, but esteemed them also to be by the Mahometan Religion obliged ever to defend and maintain them. But these last Wars, have quite put the Turks out of their Ancient Methods; for instead of maintaining a War no longer than Three Years, they have been forced to continue it for more than Twenty, to the great Ruin and Destruction of their Empire. I have always been of Opinion, That the Turks could never main∣tain a VVar for longer than Three Years, I mean with benefit, and profit to the advancement of the Ottoman Empire, of which I once made very perspicuous Observations. Whilst I was in the Camp with them, I found the Timariots very poor, and wanting at the end of that Term, so that they stoal from each other their Bridles and Saddles, Lances, and all other necessaries of War, and would excuse themselves by saying, that they could not do otherwise in so long a War of more than their Three Years: And in like manner the Jani∣saries by their ancient Constitution might challenge a Privilege to quit the Service at the end of the Month of October, and in case they were not called, they might then Disband themselves, on St. Demetriu's Day, which is the 28th Day of October, at which time the Janisar Aga, could not without danger of his own Life in some mutiny deny them dismission for that Year's Campaign: VVhich the Janisaries esteemed always a Privilege due to their Order, but the Asiatick Timariots called Timar Spahcelar were always sooner dismissed, in consideration of the long Journies they were to make to their VVinter-Quarters, some of them being as far distant, as Bagdat or Babylon, as Damascus or Scham, as Aleppo and Iconium, and other Parts, which to Travel back∣wards and forwards would take up commonly four or five Months
time: After which to pass a Summers Campaign, was very Laborious for the Asiatick Forces to undergo, (who commonly are esteemed a soft People) which yet they were obliged to do on Forfeiture of all their Hereditary Estates; in which the Turks by their ancient Con∣stitutions were so Rigorous, that they would admit of no excuses for their absence, even of Death it self; for in case the Father died lea∣leaving an Infant Son of a Year old, even then he was obliged to the VVar, though he was carried in the Arms of his Nurse. The Hungarians consequently, being always in Action, and obliged to a perpetual Duty against the Enemy, were never excused from a strict vigilance over all the Motions of their Neighbours, whom in the times of Peace we might properly call Enemies; for they Fought very often, and yet without VVar so called; for in case they met, and engaged in the Field with a less number than Five thousand Men on a side, and without Cannon, it was not called VVar, but a Martial Exercise in the times of Peace; and that is the reason, why we find so many Palancas raised over all Hungary on one side, and the other, which are designed to give a stop to any sud∣dain Irruption of an Enemy, within which Palancas (so called) the Poor Inhabitants on either side, Shelter their VVives and Children, their Horses and Cattle, with all their Faculties and Substance, it being not lawful for the Enemies on either side to possess them. Besides, on their High-ways and Roads to a Market, every thing was to be secured, and neither side could touch the same without Justice performed upon due Complaints made to the Pasha, or Chri∣stian Governour of the Province. This was the Ancient Constitu∣tion whilst the Turks prevailed in Hungary: But since the last VVar and Peace concluded, things no doubt have been set upon ano∣ther Foot, and other Provisions have been made to secure the Chri∣stian Cause and Interest; for before this time the Turks were be∣come the most Insolent People in the VVorld, and would never do Justice to a Christian; for unless it were consistent with their own Interest and Design, they would shew themselves Proud, Haughty and Supercilious, expecting Gifts, and returning none, expecting for a Flower a piece of Gold, or some piece of Cloth of the finest Dye and Spinning we have in England; and to this Pass were the Turks come, that they called the Presents made to them by the Christians to be their Tribute, and the Ambassadors sent to them, they acknowledged for no other, than for Mahapous (as they called them) which signified Hostages given for Peace, and the Security of the Good-behaviour of their Masters towards the Port: Their Pride was also so extraordinary, that they would never vouchsafe, to require any Counterpart from the King, or Prince with whom they Trea∣ted, or Copies, unless such as were conserved amongst their Archives, or Office of the Reis Effendi, or Chief Secretary; inferring that the Power of the Grand Seignior was able to make good, whatsoever
he should require on the Score of the Royal Signature; which no Sovereign Prince will now receive from a Proud and Insolent Turk: For praised be that God of the Christians, who hath brought down that Imperious Spirit of the Turks to such a Degree, That they can now own their Weakness and be ashamed of their former Follies, which render'd them insupportable in their Conversation with Christians.

THE HISTORY OF THE TURKS From the Year 1678, to the Year 1699. Anno 1679.WE have in our preceding History represented the Ottoman Empire for seve∣ral years past, under ma∣ny Circumstances of Hap∣piness and Glory. The Turks had been successful in their Wars abroad, having in∣creased and enlarged their Empire by ad∣ding Newhausel in Hungary thereunto, with the Countrey belonging to it. They had gained and conquered all the Island of Can∣dia, with that invincible Fortress, and there∣upon had put an end to a War with the Venetians, which had continued for the space of Twenty six Years. After which they carried their Conquering Arms into Poland, where they took the strong Fortress of Caminiec, which is the Key of that King∣dom; and thence marched into that Coun∣trey as far as Leopolis, which they brought under the Tribute of Eighty thousand Crowns a-year, and so returned back again into their own Dominions without any Op∣position, or so much almost as the Appear∣ance of an Enemy: And to render this Action the more observable, it was attend∣ed with the least Expence of Blood and Treasure, of any Enterprize of so bold and daring a Design; and proved an Expedition so profitable and beneficial, that scarce a Ja∣nizary or Horseman returned without Spoil, or Plunder, or Slaves of both Sexes. All which Wars were acted within the space of Thirteen Years, during the Government of Achmet Kuperli, with such Intervals al∣so of Peace, that War seemed but an En∣tertainment to exercise the Soldiery, and amuse their Minds, lest they should fall into Mutiny and Sedition; all the Parti∣culars of which we have already at large related. And here I cannot but observe, and say, That Justice is the proper means to render a People flourishing and happy; an Instance whereof we have through all the Government of Kuperli, who being a Person educated and skilful in the Law, administred Justice equally to the People; his Eyes were not blinded with Avarice, which might biass or thwart him in giving Judgment; he was not cruel, or bloody, or inclined to take away Mens Lives for the sake of their Riches; nor more ambitious than what served to make him jealous of his Honour, and zealous to conserve and keep up his Fame and Reputation in the World; which is necessary for Ministers in his sublime Station. Wherefore let us look on those Times which were as quiet, calm and peaceable as any that ever had smiled on the Ottoman State, and justly r bute those Blessings to the Favour of Heaven, which was pleased in those Days to behold so much Justice and Equity dispensed to a People unaccustomed there∣unto, and perhaps in Reward thereof, to make the Government more easie and plea∣sant, than either before or since those Hal∣cyon Days. But now that Kara Mustapha comes to succeed in the Place of so just and equal a Governour, a Person of Vio∣lence, Rapine, Pride, Covetousness, False, Perfidious, Bloody, and without Reason or Justice; we have nothing to represent at the beginning of his Government, besides his Oppression, Extortion, Cruelties and Acts of Injustice beyond any thing that was ever practised before in the Reign of the most Tyrannical Princes: and in Pro∣cess of time becoming vastly Rich with the Spoils and Ruine of many thou∣sands of Families, he accomplishes the full Measure of his Iniquity by the persidious Breach of the Truce between the Emperor and his Master the Sultan: For tho' it wanted only three Years of being expired, yet trusting to the Power and Force of his
ill-gotten Wealth, he had not Patience to expect so long a Term, being pushed for∣ward by his own Destiny, and incited thereunto by covetous and ambitious De∣sires, joyned to a Scorn, and a mean Opi∣nion of the Christians, to whom he would scarce allow either Understanding, or Cou∣rage, or Conduct in War: In which vain Confidence and Presumption of his invin∣cible Power, he precipitated the whole Ot∣toman Empire into a dismal and direful Con∣dition and State, from whence proceeded nothing but Slaughter, and Tragedies, fa∣tal both to his own self, and to his Ma∣ster, as will appear in the Progress of this History. But before we enter on those greater Matters, let us first consider this Grand Vizier in his Behaviour towards the Turks, and others who were Subjects to the Sultan. It is certain, that he had his first Rise from Kuperli the Father, and married his Daughter, and was after∣wards on the score of that Alliance, fa∣voured by the Son: he was made Capitan Pasha, or Admiral of the Fleet; but being as it were out of his Element, and not pleased with the Sea, he was constituted Chimacam, and placed with the Grand Seignior, and at all times next his Person when the Vizier was absent, and employ∣ed in the Wars: In which Capacity and Condition (as we have before related) he behaved himself with that gentle and assa∣ble Behaviour towards all Persons, as gave Hopes and Expectations of better and more temperate Government when he should come to be Vizier. But being raised to that sublime Station, he soon changed his Hu∣mour, and began to shew the Fierceness of his Nature, which he had long suppres∣sed. In Evidence of which, we have so ma∣ny Instances and Examples of his Cruelty and Injustice to produce, that had we no other matter than his Management of Af∣fairs in the time of Peace, without Re∣gard or Reference to Foreign Wars, his Proceedings were so irregular and unrea∣sonable, as might for the Extravagancy of them, deserve to be kept in Memory: But they are too many to be recounted, and therefore we shall content our selves with some few which have relation to the Eng∣lish Nation, and to the Subjects of other Princes in Peace and Alliance with the Turk. The Case of Mr. Samuel Pentlow, who lived about Thirty Years a Merchant at Smyrna, will never be forgotten by the English Factory of that Place: The mat∣ter is so extraordinary as might deserve to be related at large, with all the Circum∣stances of it; but I shall confine my self to a short and brief Narrative, which was this. Mr. Pentlow had by a long Trade, in tract of time, gained very considerable Riches, besides an Estate in Land left hi by his Father in England; to i which, being desirous to have Heirs his own Body, he married a Greek Woman of mean Extraction. The Grand Vizier having received intimation thereof, and of the Riches of Pentlow, which were magni∣fied to him, according to the Account made on Rich Men, whose Fortune it is to have their Estates always over-valued; he immediately swallowed in his Thoughts all his Wealth and Estate, as if he had been a Pasha, or some other Subject who had grown fat and wealthy to a degree worthy the Grand Seignior's Notice and Acceptance. And to bring him within the compass of such a Seizure, he declared, That whosoever had married a Woman, who was a Subject to the Grand Seignior, did by Virtue of such a Match become, ipso facto, a Subject, and yield himself to the same Condition with his Wife; which being a Law never before made or declared, was levelled only at Pentlow to hook in his Estate; having never before been pra∣ctised, and perhaps will never be again, unless the same Circumstances concurr of such a Vizier, and such a Person as this our Merchant was. Pentlow had notice of this new Law which the Vizier had promulged, and was not unsensible that it was levelled at his Estate: But yet I know not what Star guided him, or what Charm affixed, or wedded him to the Countrey, he provi∣ded not against the Snare laid for him, which he might easily have avoided by exporting his Estate, as Merchants com∣monly do, into other Countries; but in∣stead thereof, he keeps all about him, and finding himself sickly and decaying, he made his last Will and Testament in a formal manner,Mr. Ga∣briel Smith and Mr. John Ash∣ley. and constituted two Merchants to be his Executors, without Reflection or Thoughts how the Vizier had decreed the Grand Seignior to be his Heir, which accordingly succeeded in a short time afterwards: For Pentlow being dead, the News was speedily carried to the Chief Customer at Adrianople, who had laid the Plot to seize his Estate; and by him the Grand Vizier was informed of the great Wealth fallen to the Sultan by the Death of his English Subject. The covetous Desire of so vast Riches, which was magnified five times beyond its real Value, caused the Vizier with all Expedi∣tion to dispatch a Capugi-Basha to Smyrna to take all the Estate of the Deceased into his Hands, for the Use of the Grand Seig∣nior; and in case the Executors refused to
make a free and clear Resignation accord∣ingly, then to bring them up Prisoners to Adrianople. The Executors not complying as the Officers required, were carried up by him to Adrianople: Where to extort from them a confession of the whole Estate, they were threatned with the Gallies, with the Rack, the Wheel and other Tortures. In fine, after an Imprisonment of some Days, with a Collar of Iron about their Necks, to which a Chain was fixed and rivetted to a Post with Manacles on their Hands; and after a thousand menaces of farther Punish∣ment, they were forced so far to comply, as to Promise, and give Obligation to pay un∣to the Vizier, or his Order, the Sum of Ninety thousand Dollars within a certain time after their Arrival at Smyrna. To raise this Money against the Term prefixed, such hast was made, that the Goods of the Deceased were Sold at such low Rates, that they amounted not within Five or Six thou∣sand Dollars of the Sum, for which the Executors had Engaged; which they refu∣sing to pay out of their own Estates; were again Imprisoned at Smyrna, where they lay for the space of five or six Months, until such time as a Composition was made, and Expedients found for their Enlargment. Many other passages occurred of the like in∣justice, thro' the whole course of this matter, which for brevity sake we purposely omit: In regard that what we have said already, is sufficient to give the Reader an instance of this Vizier's avarice and injustice: Of which the Turks,He was af∣terwards Grand Vi∣zier, and cut off with the Grand Seignior. as well as the Christians were so sensible; that Solyman, the late Vizier's Kiaja, or Steward, and then Imbrahor or Master of the Horse to the Grand Seignior, demanding one day concerning the Avania of Pentlow, could not suppress his Thoughts (tho' much a Courtier) but said, In this Man's time the Musselmin or Believers, can∣not expect better Usage or Treatment than the Gaurs or Christians. But this single in∣stance is not sufficient to express the un∣just, and rapacious Humour of this Vizier; who in an unparallell'd manner of proceeding did ever incline to the Plaintiff; in whose favour having given Sentence against the Defendant to the utmost Asper demanded, his method was to cause the Money im∣mediately to be paid; and took it to him∣self, giving the Plaintiff some small share thereof, not worthy the Trouble or Ex∣pence of the Suit: In this manner he dealt with another Merchant of our Nation, on whom one Pizzamano an Italian made a false pretence of Six thousands Dollars, which Cause being brought before the Vi∣zier, he readily condemned our English Merchant; and having forced the payment by a rigorous Imprisonment, he appro∣priated the whole Sum to his own Use; giving the Plaintiff about Thirty Dollars, as a gratuitous Reward for turning Turk; he having in compliance with the Vizier, and to gain his favour, renounced his Faith, and Sold his Religion at so vile a Price. In a short time after which the Vizier extorted from our Turky Company Fifty thousand Dollars, and demanded an increase of the usual Presents which at certain times were made to him, and to all the Officers of the Court: The which, and the like man∣ner of Proceedings, tho' they gained him the hatred of all Men, yet the constancy of the Grand Seignior to his Ministers, and his me∣thod in making his Master sharer with him in all his Rapines, seemed to secure him from all apprehension of Danger: For when the Grand Seignior upon Complaints made to him, told him of the ill Reports he had received; The Vizier answered, That his Ma∣jesty might be pleased to weigh the Benefits he had received by his Administration of Affairs, which would appear by the Increase of his Treasury; and that if he desired to have his Empire well Governed, he must suffer him to use the means proper for that end; other∣wise his Head was at his Command, which he might take off, and supply the Office with a better Minister. Many and frequent were the Examples of his unheard of injustices, as well to the Turks as to the Christians. The Valide Kiajan, or the Queen Mo∣ther's Steward, whose place was always esteemed quiet, and free from danger, and Independant of the Meri, or the Grand Seig∣nior's Treasury; and their Estates permitted to go to their Children without any Inter∣ruption: Yet dying very Rich by the be∣nefit of his Office, which he had enjoyed 18 Years; The Vizier was desirous to par∣take of the Estate, and taxed his Heirs at 1200 Purses, for Payment of which the Grand Seignior at the Instigation of the Vizier caused a Vakuf, or an Estate given to the Church to be seized; which was such a piece of Sacrilege, as was never known, or heard of before in that Em∣pire. Draco Bey, a late Prince of Moldavia,Draco Bey tortured. falling short in the Payments he was to make to the Grand Seignior for Tribute of that Principality, had the Torture given him in Prison at least six times with Fire, and other ways, which cause the acu∣test pains; during which, they forc'd his Son to stand by him, and threatned to put him into his place, in case the Father dy'd un∣der the Torture. But more hard and severe than all this,The Ragu∣sean Am∣bssador Imprisoned. seems the Case of the Ragusean Ambassadors, from whom, besides the Annual Tribute
demanded of that Republick, the Vizier re∣quir'd 300 Purses as a Fine for what they had receiv'd on account of Customs, which the Turks Trading into their Ports had pay'd them during all the time of the Venetian War; the benefit of which was esteem'd so great, and their Town so much enrich'd by the grand acquisitions of Trade, that 300 Purses, or 150000 Dollars, seem'd a mean exaction from a People so well improv'd and enrich'd as the Raguseans were adjudged to be. It is true, their City being advan∣tageously Situated in the Gulf of Venice, did for a long time during that War reap a considerable benefit by Trade, it being made the chief Mart or Scale for all the Commo∣dities which Bulgaria, Hungary, Transilvania, and the Countries thereabouts, yielded for the supply of Italy: To advance which, the Raguseans had erected a Factory at Sophia, which as I remember, (for I was at that Place three times) consisted of about 30 Merchants, whose Employment was to buy Hides, Tallow, Wax, and the like, and send them by Caravan to Ragusa, from whence they were transported to other parts of the World. The Vizier hereupon making up an account of the Profit which this little Republick could, or might have gain'd in so many years, esteem'd it reason∣able, that the Grand Seignior, by whose Wars they had gain'd, should partake of a share in their Profits, which by a Computation he made out of his own head, or with the help perhaps of his Jew-Broaker, or of the Customer of Constantinople, he valued at so high a Rate, that 300 Purses were esteemed a moderate allowance to the Grand Seignior out of such vast Riches which they had acquired. With this notion of the matter the Vizier called the two Ragusean Am∣bassadors to his presence, Commanding them immediately to write unto their Principals to provide with all speed the 300 Purses which the Grand Seignior required from them in return of the favour and pro∣tection he had given them, during his Wars with Venice. The Ambassadors who were well acquainted with the Poverty of their State, which had for several years past labour'd under great difficulties to pay the Annual Tribute which the Turks exacted from them, endeavour'd to possess the Vizier with a true sense of the impossibility of rai∣sing such a Sum within the compass of their narrow Dominions; alledging that in the Year 1666. their whole City had been subverted by an Earthquake, in which all the Inhabitants perish'd, excepting 5000 Persons only, who by God's Providence being directed to the Fields, or Streets, were conserv'd from this Universal Ruine: The which Desolation was so grievous, that two Ages could not repair their Losses, nor increase their People to their former numbers. But the Vizier who could endure no contradiction, nor excuses in opposition to his covetous desires, Commanded the Ambassadors immediately to write to the Government to send the Money, for pay∣ment of which no more than 3 Months would be allow'd; at the expiration of which, the Raguseans being in no Capacity to comply, the Ambassadors were sent Prisoners to the Seven Towers, and threatned with Tortures, and drubbing on the Feet, unless speedy payment were made. After more than a Years Imprisonment, at the beginning of the Year 1680. by the Me∣diation and Interposition of Friends, the Business was Compounded for 120 Purses, but broke off again upon the time of pay∣ment; which the Vizier required to be sa∣tisfied, together with the Annual Tribute in one Payment in August following: But they alledg'd the impossibility thereof, by rea∣son of the extream poverty of the Place, which had now for two years been de∣prived of all Commerce, and the benefit of the Saline, from which their chief Re∣venue did arise, and therefore humbly de∣sired to pay it at thrice; that is, 40 Purses the next August, and as much the Years following, with the usual Tributes. But the Vizier not contented with these Condi∣tions, commanded them in his rage to be cast into a Dungeon of the Prison, and threatned to have the Torture given them. The Mufti interceded in their behalf, and laid before the Vizier the injustice of the Act, but in vain: The Kadilescher or one of the Chief Justices refused to Sign a Hoget, or Sentence in the Case, without positive command from the Grand Seignior. Howso∣ever they were remanded to Prison without other legality of Sentence than the Vizier's Boyardi and Command, where they re∣main'd until the time that the Vizier march'd into Hungary, when with some mitigation of the Sentence, together with some drubs, they were set at Liberty. We shall only add one instance more to demonstrate the manner and method of this Vizier in his Judicial Proceedings,The Secre∣tary of Holland drubb'd. which was in the Case of Monsieur Debrosses Se∣cretary to the Ambassador of Holland, who having a Demand on the Metropolite, or Greek Bishop of Scio, for a Debt of one thousand Dollars, upon non-payment of the Money call'd his Debtor to Justice; the Pa∣triarch appear'd at the Divan to defend the Cause, with several other Metropolites, some of which might resemble the Debtor; De∣brosses being asked whether he knew his Debtor, he not having seen him in seve∣ral years, made answer, That perhaps he
did, or perhaps he did not, and pointed to a wrong Person; whereupon the Vizier call'd him Telbis, or Robber, to which he re∣ply'd, That Franks were not Men of that Profession, or who made false Pretences: The Vizier enrag'd with this Answer, order'd him immediately in his presence to have 300 drubs given him; of which ha∣ving receiv'd 193, he lay stunn'd, and for dead; and then upon the humble interces∣sion of the Bostangi-Bashee a remission was granted of the remainder. Nor did the Patriarch and his Bishops carry off their Cause so clear and easie, but were forc'd to pay unto the Vizier a good part of that Sum which the Plaintiff demanded, in reward and acknowledgment of that justice which was done them. The Cha∣racter of Kara Kiaja.He that made at this time the greatest Figure at Court next to the Vizier, was Kara Kiaja, of whom, to know him, we need give no other Character, than that he was the Vizier's great Confident, and intimate to all his Councels; for having all the ill qualifications, and mischievous Arts of the other, he was the most likely Per∣son to succeed the Vizier, which we shall find verified some years hereafter. He was Capitan-Pasha, or Admiral of the Gallies, which is esteem'd one of the greatest Places of Trust and Honour in the whole Empire; but he was remov'd from that Station, not in disgrace, but by favour of the Vizier, who knowing him to be a Person like him∣self, and of his Humor and Principles, plac'd him near the Person of the Grand Seignior, with Title of Chimacam; and in recompence for the Commission which he had laid down, he was gratified with the Re∣venue of three Passalicks in Anatolia, which had been given to the late Vizier after his return from Candia in his Place. Capitan Passa (of whom we have formerly made mention) was made Capitan Pasha, and this year dispatched with Sixty Gallies into the Black-Sea, for building the two Castles upon the Boristhenes: Other Preparations were not made this year for the War of Muscovy, for the Turks intending for this Campaign to remain on the defensive part, design'd only to build those Forts which were to Command the passage of that River, and for the future to stop the Excursions and Pyracies of the Cossacks into the Black-Sea. The Muscovites, tho' desirous of a Peace with the Turk, yet out of dulness, or ignorance, made faint applications for it, by the means of a single Letter only, which was sent from Mosco by the hands of an Armenian who was turn'd Russe, that is, one who had reconcil'd himself to the Rus∣sian Church, and had no other business than only to deliver this Letter; the Contents of which was, That the Turks should quit Verania, and desist from Building their Forts on the Boristhenes, both which Proposals were rejected, and no Answer return'd unto the Letter. So that now the Thoughts and Prepara∣tions for War giving no disturbance at the Port, the Grand Seignior apply'd himself to the most soft Pleasures. He was not now so eager in his Huntings as formerly, but attended to the more common Delights of the Seraglio; he had gotten together a par∣cel of Dancing and Singing Girls, which had been presented to him, for he would not be at the expence to buy them; tho' he was so kind to them, as to have three of them at the same time with Child by him, and kept in the Seraglio; where hereafter they may prove a reserve to the Ottoman Line, when the Souldiers shall become more want only profuse of the Blood of their Empe∣rors. At this time likewise Kul Ogli, Favou∣rite to the Grand Seignior, who (as we have before related) had in the year 1675. Mar∣ried the Grand Seignior's Daughter at Adri∣anople, a Child then of 7 years of Age, being now become ripe for her Husband, he Bed∣ded her at the beginning of this year. And farther to increase the Pleasures of the Court,Pleasures of the Court. the Grand Seignior for his Di∣vertisement caus'd a Dunalmah or Triumph to be made, which was represented on the Water by multitudes of Boats hanging out Lights, and Fire-Works on the Walls of the Seraglio; and a Float was made in the Sea, representing the Island of Malta, which was batter'd on all sides by a Fleet of Gallies. But for all these Triumphs Constantinople,Fire in Constanti∣nople. which hath ever been infested by Pestilence, and grievous Incendiations, was greatly afflicted this year by many Fires; the greatest was on Christmas-Eve, which, by common compute burnt down 2000 Houses, all that quarter called the Fanar, with part of the Greek Patriarchs Church, the remainder be∣ing with much difficulty saved. After which, another Fire happening near the Old Palace of Constantine, a Boy found in the Rubbish a Diamond that weigh'd 96 Carats, which he sold for 3 Paraws, or about two pence half-penny; and the Buyer re-sold it again for a Zelot, or about half a Crown, to one of those Shops near Sultan Bajazet's Mosch, which sell Stones for Seals, and pieces of Chrystal for Rings; and there it lay for some time unregarded, until at length the Owner not finding a Chapman, brought it to an Armenian to set in Silver. The Armenian being a Jeweller, soon ap∣prehended the nature of the Stone, but the largeness of the size causing him to mistrust his own judgment, he Consulted two others,
and upon Trial, it proved to be a real Dia∣mond; so when the Owner came for his Stone, it was pretended to be lost, and with a Dollar and half they contented him. But the Jewellers disagreeing in the division of so great a Purchase; and one fearing to be betray'd by the other, he that had it in Possession discovered it, and sent it to the Grand Seignior. 'Twas said to be the most perfect, and best Water that ever was seen. It was very old, and given to be new Cut. It was judged to have been a Jewel belonging to the Greek Emperors; it not being entred into the Register of the Seraglio, where all Jewels of value are Recorded. ANNO 1680. 1680.THis year began with the most solemn Council that was ever known to have been held at Constantinople,A Council called. within the me∣mory Man. Those present at it, were all the Pashaes of the Bench, the Janizar-Aga, Topegi-Bashee or Master of the Ordnance, the Chief of the Spahees, the two Kadiles∣chers, or Chief Justices; in short all the Great Men, then present, of the Empire. The Council was summoned at the motion of the Grand Vizier, who having a Breach with the Christian Emperor then in pro∣spect, had a desire to feel the Pulse and try the Inclinations of the great Men, how they stood affected to such an Enterprise. But it seems the Proposal did not very well rellish; for that a Moscovite Ambassador being on his Journey to the Port, the Issue or Event of his Negotiation was first to be expected: And in the mean time, it was concluded most safe, and prudent not to Engage in another War. Besides, the Em∣peror was then actually in Treaty to renew the Truce with the Grand Seignior, which in few Years terminated; and to that end, had sent an Envoy extraordinary to the Port, but he dy'd before his Negotiation was accomplished, as did also three other Residents in less than the compass of one Year,  who were all employ'd to conserve, and renew the Peace. The preparations for War this year be∣ing thus laid aside. The Vizier was at leisure to Marry his Daughter to the Grand Seignior's Hazna-Kajasee,The Vizier Marries his Daughter. or Privy-purse, who thereupon was promoted to be a Pasha of the Divan, or Vizier of the Bench; he was esteemed the Richest Man in the Empire; which the Grand Vizier soon found to his high Advantage; for he dy∣ing 40 Days after his Marriage, the Vizier in right of his Daughter entred into a vast Inheritance. The Widow remained not long in her desolate Condition, before she was promised to Osman then Pasha of Grand Cairo, who had formerly been Bostangi-Bashee, or Chief of the Gardiners, and Chi∣macam of Constantinople. By these means the Vizier was grown so Rich, and Great, and Insolent,Faction a∣gainst the Vizier. that he created many Enemies; but the most dan∣gerous to him, was a Faction at Court, the Chief of which were the Kuzlir-Aga, or Prime Eunuch of the Women, and Solyman the Imbrahor, or Master of the Horse, the which made it their business to cross the Vizier, in all his Proceedings; and disap∣pointed him of preferring a favourite of his, to the place of second Master of the Horse, which was lately become vacant by the death of that Officer; and one prefer'd thereunto at the recommendation of Soly∣man Pasha, who was his Friend, and had been Treasurer to the late Vizier. Upon which defeat the great Vizier fearing that he lost ground, and decay'd in his power and interest, thought fit to hasten his own Marriage with the Grand Seignior's Daugh∣ter, a Child of 8 years of Age; who like other Sultanaes was Married to no other end, than that her Husband might have the Honour to maintain her a Court, and Equipage agreeable to a Lady of her De∣gree and Quality. This near Alliance to the Ottoman Blood, and familiar Conversation with the Sultan, could not be procured and maintained with∣out a vast expence to the Vizier; who was commanded by the Grand Seignior to Treat him once, and sometimes twice a Week, and at every Meal, it cost him 25 Purses of Money, besides other presents to the Valide, or Queen Mother, and other pow∣erful Persons at Court to an incredible va∣lue: To support which Charge, Rapine and Violence were necessary, and nothing but a share in the Booty and Pray could stop and fortifie the Ears of the Sultan, and Ministers of the Court against the Cries, and Groans of oppressed Wretches. One of the ways to Raise Money, (and that esteemed none of the meanest) was by Avanias, or false pretences to be made on the Ambassadors, or Residents of Chri∣stian Princes, then actually residing at the Port; the violation of whose Character and Office the Vizier esteemed to be no Sin or Offence; being in his Opinion but Gaurs and Infidels, and such as were sent for Pledges, and Pawns for the Fidelity of their Masters to the Turks: Besides which, he conceived so mean an esteem of all Christi∣an Princes, and undervalued their power and courage in War; that he believed no Indignities or Dishonourable usage could pro∣voke them to a Resentment, or a Revenge for any injuries received: And so far had
this belief generally prevailed, that the Pa∣shaes, and Governours who lived at a di∣stance from the Port, would tell the Mer∣chants, that in case their Estates were seized, and one of their Hands cut off, and expelled the Country; yet so wedded were they to their own Interest, and to the Delights of the Turkish Air, that the next Year they would return again,The Vizier Treats the Christian Ministers with Scorn. and adventure the like Treatment rather than forego the hopes, and sweetness of that profit, which they had tried, and expected in the Dominions of the Grand Seignior. The Vizier had cer∣tainly thoughts like these, and the same poor and contemptible esteem of Christian Princes in comparison with the Ottoman Force, which was no doubt one of his chief Motives to commence that fatal War, which in a few years afterwards he unhap∣pily begun. And in the mean time acting on these Principles, he treated all the Chri∣stian Ministers at the Port with equal Scorn and Contempt. To begin with the French, he deny'd to that Ambassador the Privilege of Sitting on the Soffra, when he admitted him to Audi∣ence; an Honour formerly allowed to Christian Representatives; but now out of the height of Pride over-looking all the World, and not enduring to see a Christian to sit either so near or equal to him, the Vi∣zier made it a standing Rule, That no Am∣bassador whatsoever should have his Stool placed on the Soffra: But his most Christian Majesty, who was always tender in Points which concern'd his Honour, gave positive Commands to his Ambassador: Not to ac∣cept of Audience on any Terms derogatory to the ancient respect; and the Vizier as Resolute on the other side, procured the Grand Seignior's command, to confirm that method of receiving Ambassadors, so that it was no longer an act of the Vizier's but of the Sultan's Determination: In which re∣solves on both sides the Vizier went to Adri∣anople, intending never to retract his Words; which afterwards proved true; for greater Thoughts, and Employments diverted him from other Treaties on that Matter. But before things proceeded thus far, the Vizier called this Ambassador to an Account for what the French-men of War had acted a∣gainst the Tripolins, by violating the Grand Seignior's Port of Scio, for that People ha∣ving committed many Pyracies on the French Nation, and then actually in War with them, were Roving in the Seas of the Archepelago, and there unhappily meeting with their Enemy, the French, they took Refuge and Shelter under the Castle of Scio: The French-men of War being animated against their Enemy, and tempted with the sight of their Prey so near, and within their view, entred the Port and made several Shot at the Tripolins, some of which coming a Shoar and doing some little Damage to the People; it was interpreted as a Breach of the Peace, and Violation of the Grand Seignior's Port.the French Ambassador imprisoned. Complaints whereof being brought to Con∣stantinople, the Vizier sent for the Ambassa∣dor to his Seraglio, and without seeing him, committed him Prisoner to the Custody of the Chaous-Bashee; Demanding Two hundred thousand Crowns for reparation of the Dama∣ges which the French Ships had done at the Port of Scio, and also in satisfaction for the affront which they had done to the Grand Seignior in the Violation of his Port, which amounted unto no less than an absolute Breach of the Peace. The Ambassador re∣mained some Nights under this restraint with menaces, and threats of being removed thence to the Seven Towers: During which time the Customer (Husaein-Aga, (who was always made the Agiator between the Vizier, and the Frank Nations) pressed the Ambas∣sador with much earnestness, to an accom∣modation with the Vizier: And indeed there was Reason for it, because it was the first time, that ever the Vizier had right in his demands; for certainly the Actions of the French Ships at Scio were not to be justifi∣ed, nor otherwise to be judged than as Acts of Hostility. The Agreement was carried so privately between the Ambassador and the Customer, that after a confinement of three Days and Nights, the Ambassador was set at Liberty, with a Rumour over all the Town of being acquited and cleared with∣out any payment, or engagement whatsoe∣ver. But time, which brings all things to light, did by the event discover about three or four Months afterwards, that the great Sum demanded was to be paid tho' in such a manner, that the Payment seemed noti∣onal and figurative only, by which a tenth part was taken for the whole. And not to concern the King's Honour therein, the tender of this Satisfaction was not to be made in Presence of the Ambassador, but by the Secretary and some Merchants; who were to give it out to the World, as an Act of their own, and as if they had paid the price at their own expence, rather than their Trade should be obstructed by an open Rupture. But whatsoever was ru∣moured abroad, and what Tricks were jug∣led under Hand, the Grand Seignior took it for granted, that the Money or the value thereof in Goods was to be laid down, and that the King by his Ambassador or Agents under him, was to be concerned in the Atonement which was offered in Satis∣faction for the late Trespass: And that he might not be deceived herein; the Grand Seignior contrary to his usual Custom, which
was to refer all such Negotiations as these to the management of the Vizier, would himself be present at this submission; per∣haps because he would fancy that Great King actually at the foot of his Throne, offering his Presents and Sacrifices for a Reconciliation. And indeed the Scene open'd not much unlike it, for when the Curtain was drawn up, behold the Grand Seignior seated in Majesty on his Throne, and beneath him the Secretary and Agents of the French Na∣tion, prostrating themselves with their Pre∣sents before him; and then the Usher of the R. Presence Proclaim'd with an audible Voice, Behold the Agents sent from the King of France to humble themselves before our Myste∣rious Emperor, and in the Name of that their King to offer their Presents in satisfaction for that Assront and Insult which the French Ships offer'd at the Port of Scio. After which the Presents were produc'd according to the List, and an Estimate set upon them. As namely, Here is a Piece of Sattin value so much, a Piece of Cloth of Gold so much, a Clock at such a Rate, all Priz'd and Estimated at ten times more than their worth;Matters jugled be∣tween the Turks, and France. which the Grand Seignior did either little understand, or at least was willing to oversee; having perhaps other more secret In∣trigues then in agitation between himself and the Court of France, things at that time tending to a Breach between the Turks, and the Em∣peror of Germany. Or perhaps the Grand Seignior was well enough satisfied in gaining his Point, which was to see Agents from France humbling themselves before him in that submissive Address. Nor did the English Ambassador receive much better treatment, for besides several preceeding Avanias, one whereof was cast on the Turkey Company in general, on oc∣casion of a vast Sum of Lion Dollars im∣ported to Aleppo, which at that time was the most hopeful Trade. Upon notice of the Importation of so immense a Sum in ready Money, the Vizier's heart was enlarg'd, so that he swallow'd down a great share thereof within his imagination and desires;Troubles on the English Merchants. and to bring the substance nearer to him, he pretended that they were false Money, and brought into the Grand Seigniors Dominions to Cheat and Defraud his Subjects with Coyn of a low and base Alloy. To prove the truth of this Allegation, Commands were sent to Aleppo to try the Money, which accordingly was done, in the presence of the Chief Officers; and tho' they receiv'd a full demonstration of the true intrinsick value, according to the legal Standard of that Money, yet there was need of Presents to obtain such a favourable Report as might satisfie the Vizier, and make the Money currant in the Country. But be the Hoget or Report what it would, it could never content the Vizier, who insisted that the Certificates were false, and gain'd by Bribery and Corruption; and therefore for his bet∣ter assurance, he would send for the Money to Constantinople, or at least for a great part thereof, that an assay or proof of its good∣ness might be made in his presence. In short, to avoid so great a loss and mischief to the Merchants, 17000 Dollars were pre∣sented to the Vizier and his Officers to take off farther pretences from that Money; which, with the Presents and Charges at Aleppo, amounted to more than 20000 Dollars. Some Months after this, the Visier want∣ing a new Pretence to draw more Money from the English Nation, he signified to the Ambassador, Sir John Finch, his desire to have the Capitulations sent to him by the hand of his Interpreter, on pretence of reading some particular Articles therein for his own Information, and Instruction. The Vizier accordingly having them in his hand, de∣tain'd them, saying,A Trick put on the English Ambassa∣dor. That there were se∣veral Articles therein, which being contrary to the Turkish Law, and prejudicial to the Grand Seignior's Power and Revenue were to be made void and null, which he would take care to expunge, and would afterwards return unto the Ambassador another Capitulation. This new Method of proceeding was very surprizing to Sir John Finch, then Lord Am∣bassador, and the whole English Nation; who being divested of their defensive Arms, and of those Articles on which all their se∣curity in that Country was establish'd, look'd on themselves and their Estates as expos'd to the will and arbitrary pleasure of the Turks. It seem'd now as if our Nation remain'd in a state of War, or in a Condition of Out-lawed People, being deprived of our Law and Privileges. The Consuls did usually carry the Authentick Copies of the Capitu∣lations with them, whensoever they appear'd before the Kadies, or Justices; but the Ori∣ginal Exemplar being taken away, the force of the Copies ceas'd, and those Articles could not be produc'd, in Plea for us, as formerly they were. This Matter relating to a state of War and Peace, was transmit∣ted home to his Majesty's Consideration; who was humbly intreated by the Turkey Company to take notice thereof in Letters directed to the Grand Seignior, and the Vizier. But in the mean time the inconve∣niences were so great, and the obstructions to Trade so insupportable, that it was thought fit to ransom our Capitulations out of Captivity at any rate, rather than to ha∣zard all our Interest by the want of them. So that a Treaty being commenc'd, it was agree'd, that upon payment of 50 Purses of Money, being 25 thousand Dollars, the Ca∣pitulations
should be restor'd, which was ac∣cordingly perform'd. In this Condition things stood, when the Lord Chandois, another Ambassador from his Majesty, arriv'd at Constantinople, bringing, besides his Credentials, Letters to the Grand Seignior and Vizier, containing no other matter than Complaints of that unworthy Seizure of the Capitulations, and of the Price and Ransom paid for them; an Action so strange and new, that an Example of the like nature was never known, or heard of in the World. The Vizier, contrary to his usual Custom, being touched with a sense of shame for so mean an Action; did desire that the Letter of this Tenure from our King to the Grand Seignior might be smothered, and not delivered; promising to make resti∣tution of the Fifty purses, he had taken on that occasion. This offer from the Vizier seemed a thing incredible, and as impossible to redeem a Soul out of Hell, as a Purse of Money out of his Coffers: Howsoever, so touched he was with the sense of this Act, of which the Grand Seignior had as yet no knowledge, nor taken any share in the Booty, that he ordered Twenty nine purses of the Money to be restored; but with so ill a Grace, and so unpleasant a Countenance, that our Merchants apprehended some other Contrivances, and Machinations to be re∣paid again with a severe interest; which might probably have been expected, had not the Vizier been diverted from these low acqui∣sitions to matters of higher concernment in Hungary: Howsoever, before his departure he left those menacing promises behind him, which threatned no less than Ruin and De∣struction at his Return. We might here recount several other Acts of injustice pas∣sed on our Nation: As the encouragement of the Pasha of Tunis, to make demands on our Ambassador for what Goods the Cor∣saires, or Pirates had taken from him, on one of our English Ships: And tho' out of the respect and deference which the Great Duke of Tuscany, and the Great Master of Malta bore to the Majesty of our King, and by the industry and good management of Sir John Finch, then Ambassador at Constantino∣ple, the greatest part of the Goods and Money taken were restored, for which the Pasha declared himself satisfied; yet this Pasha receiving countenance and encourage∣ment from this Vizier in his pretensions, demanded 450 Purses to be paid him by the Ambassador, for the remaining Goods which were not recovered. And tho' this preten∣sion in the late Vizier's time, (a Man of more Justice and Reason than this present) was cast out, and quashed; yet the Pasha looking on this conjuncture, as the most seasonable of any, when the most extrava∣gant demands would be heard and favoured, renewed his Suit, and pleaded it before the Vizier with as many Lyes, and false Testi∣monies as were required, or could be inven∣ted to give colour to an evil Case. The Vizier hearkned most devoutly to all the Allegations, and with a bended Brow, and a stern Countenance told the Ambassador, That he was to answer for the Blood and Estates of the Turks, which were lost Aboard our English Ships: And again turning to the Pasha told him, That his Demands were too unreasonable and extravagant; and so me∣diating, as it were, sometimes on one side and sometimes on the other, with design to take on both Hands, he at length fairly dis∣missed the Audience: And in the Afternoon made a proposal by his Kaja or Deputy ab∣solutely to supersede the Cause, provided that Fifteen purses, were given to him, and Seven to his Kaja, and Reis-Effendi, who is Secretary of State. In short, after divers Treaties on this Subject, an Ac∣commodation was made with a great Sum, other businesses being entred and passed in the same Agreement. The next which comes into play is the Venetian Bailo or Ambassador, who about the beginning of this Year 1680, was sent by that Republick to reside at Constantino∣ple, his name was Ciurani, a Noble Venetian, and one who had formerly been General in Dalmatia; he was esteemed an Avaritious and a self-interessed Person, a great Merchant, and a great Politician, and one made up of Intrigues and Designs. His first Enterprise, which was to Cheat the Turks, proved un∣lucky: For having brought a great quan∣tity of Cloth of Gold with him, which was his own Merchandize and Adventure,The Vene∣tians in trouble. he endeavoured to save the Custom by Lan∣ding it under the notion of Presents, which were to be made to the Grand Seignior, and the Officers of his Court. The Goods were privately convey'd a Shoar in the Night by Boats belonging to the Ships of War, which had brought the Ambassa∣dor, and defended by a Guard of Albani∣ans, who are a company of lusty Fellows, to the number of Thirty, maintained by the Republick only to carry Letters to Zara, or Cataro in Dalmatia, from whence by a Felucca they are Transported to Venice: A Party of these Men I say conducted these Goods, and in despight of the Customer's Officers carried them to the Bailaggio, or House belonging to the Venetian Ambassa∣dors. The Customer Usaine Aga, who had notice of all that passed, dissembled at first his knowledge thereof, and contrived with the High Treasurer to send one of his Ser∣vants to Buy a considerable parcel of the Cloth of Gold for the use of the Seraglio:
And in regard different Sortments and Co∣lours were demanded, it was necessary to open and unpack divers Chests; by which means they came to a full discovery of all those Goods, which had privately been convey'd away by Night. When these Chapmen had concluded their Bargains, and agreed on the Prices, which amounted unto 3500 Dollars, they gave an Assignment for the Money on Usaine Aga the Chief Customer; who willingly accepted the Bill, but to abate it out of the Customs due for those Goods, making up the Account after his own fashion: But not content herewith, he obtained a Warrant from the Vizier di∣rected to the Judge of Galata, to examine the manner of carrying these Goods a-shoar in the Night by Force and Violence; which being made out by several Witnesses, a re∣port thereof was sent to the Vizier, who immediately thereupon gave Orders to the Vaivod, and Captain of Galata to make Search in the House of the Customer for those Goods, which had not paid the Custom. Seignior Ciurani Alarmed at this manner of Proceeding, and not willing to give an occasion to the Turks to violate the re∣spect due to the House of Venice, (which until that time was ever esteemed a San∣ctuary, and place of Refuge) seasonably compounded for his unjustifyable miscarri∣age by the Payment of 30000 Dollars. But this trouble was no sooner ended, be∣fore another of worse Consequence began, arising from certain Slaves to the number of about Fifty, which had saved themselves aboard the Venetian Men of War which had brought the Ambassador, of which Com∣plaint being made by the Masters unto the Vizier, Orders were given twice to make search aboard the Ships for them; but by help of a little Money, Inquisitions were made so superficially, that Returns were given of none to be found. But the Complaints daily increasing, new Orders were given to renew the Search, the execution whereof was committed to a Capugee and a Hasakee, who are Officers belonging to the Seraglio, together with a Naip or Kadee's Notary, who was to write down and record the pro∣ceedings. These persons being come aboard, and rudely making search after their man∣ner, the Soldiers arose against them, and beat them off, wounding some and throw∣ing the Naip and others into the Sea. Up∣on report whereof the Vizier was so enraged, that he would have had the Ships brought to the Arsenal, there to be laid up and con∣fiscated to the Grand Seignior's Service. The two Venetian Ambassadors fearing also some violence to their Persons from these disorders, betook themselves to their Ships, there to remain until Matters were a little pacified; and to make the business more easy, the Slaves (about whom was all the controversie) were privately convey'd ashoar: And a Search of the Ships submitted unto by consent, and Proposal of the Ambassa∣dors themselves. The Vizier being a little mollified with this compliance, the Chiaus-bashee (or Chief of the Pursuivants) with 200 Men were sent aboard the Ships to make a search, where being received with∣out opposition, they left no corner of the Ships unsought and unlooked into, and none being found, the Chiaus-bashee gave them a favourable report upon payment of 300 Che∣quins: After which the Bailos or Ambassa∣dors returned ashoar, referring a farther Ac∣commodation of their Matters to Usaine Aga the Customer, who was a most dexterous Person, both in raising Avanias or false Pre∣tences, and in the Ways and Arts of com∣posing them. And he accordingly so mana∣ged the matter, that with payment of Se∣venty purses to the Vizier, and Ten to the Kaja, with other petty rewards to Usaine Aga himself, and other inferiour Officers, which might in all amount to about 50000 Dollars, all Displeasures were reconciled, the new Bailo was Friendly admitted to Audi∣ence, and the old one suffered fairly to de∣part: The Masters lost their Slaves, and the Vizier got the Money. But the Troubles of the Venetian Ministers did not end here: For not long afterwards, some Desturbances arose in Dalmatia between the Turks and the Subjects of that Republick, in which a∣bove a Hundred Turks, as was reported,The Vene∣tian Bailo Imprisoned. being Cut off, the Vizier in a Rage sent the Bailo Prisoner to the seven Towers, Threatning to put him to Death; but with the Atone∣ment of 200.000 Dollars, the Vizier's gentle Heart was melted, and all things salved up and reconciled again once more. But the Republick of Venice to whose expences the Sum of 300.000 Dollars was charged, could not so easily digest this Extortion; and knowing that with the Turks there was no other remedy but patience until such time as opportunity happened to revenge it, did in the interim show their resentment, by their displeasure against Seignior Ciurani their Ambassador, whom they recalled speedi∣ly from his Employment, and constituted the Secretary in his place; and afterwards levied a great part of the Money paid unto the Turks out of his Estate, and out of the E∣state of Morosini the old Bailo. Foscari for∣merly Consul at Aleppo was made Inquisitor to examine the matter, who upon enquiry thereinto found, that the Goods which Ciu∣rani brought were to the value of 60.000 Dollars, and others which had not paid Custom at Venice, were in pena di contra∣banda, condemned in 30.000 Ducats; such
success as this have such old Politians, who pretend to a craft and cunning above other Men. And thus we have given a Relation of the Treatment which the Vizier used towards the Venetians, in which we have been the more large, to inform the World of the beginnings and grounds of the War, which soon afterwards ensued, and the Rea∣sons which moved the Venetians to joyn themselves in League with the Emperor against the Turk. The next Foreign Minister which must tast of the Vizier's kindness, was the Geno∣ese Resident. And tho' neither the Business, nor the Actions of that Nation did Admini∣ster any ground of pretence to extort Money from them; yet, the Vizier made an Avania of 5000 Dollars upon them, for what cause no Man knows, nor do the Ge∣noese themselves declare any. It is conjectur∣ed he would not suffer their Resident Seig∣nior Spinola to depart without payment of that Sum, upon pretence that during all the time of his Residence, he had never seen the Grand Seignior. The new Resident who succeeded to Spi∣nola, had been the Sopra-cargo of a Ship, and was rather a Factor than a Publick Minister; for the State of Genoua had re∣fused to have any concernment in Turky: Howsoever, they lent their name to certain Merchants for 6000 Dollars a year, who in Consideration of the Consolage to be con∣firmed to them, were to maintain a Resi∣dent at Constantinople, and a Consul at Smyrna. After which the Camera was to know no∣thing of any expence, but all sorts of Charges and Avanias were to be born by the Un∣dertakers; who allowed their Resident 1500 Dollars per annum, which with the benefit of making Strong-waters, and selling of Wine in his House, and with ways of Thrifty li∣ving, was esteemed a good subsistence for a Person of his quality. The Dutch in Troubles.The Dutch Minister which had for a long time escaped Troubles, and Avanias rather by good fortune than any good cunning, did at length, on occasion of an unavoida∣ble Dispute with Usaine Aga the Customer, fall within reach of the Vizier's Hand: And tho' the Resident foresaw the Mischief, and would have avoided the Blow by submit∣ting every thing to the Judgment of the Cu∣stomer himself; yet, to gain the Merit of bring∣ing such a Client before the Vizier, who could never depart from before his Tribunal with∣out paying roundly for his Justice, he im∣mediately preferred his Memorial against the Dutch Resident; saying, That he would not be Judge and Party, least he should be over∣partial to himself, but would rest content and submit to any Sentence which the Vizier should pronounce in publick Divan. Accordingly a Boiardee, or Warrant was sent by a Chiaus to cite the Dutch Resident's Druggerman, or Interpreter to appear in Divan with the Capitulations; which being brought thi∣ther, were there detained after the manner of the English, on pretence that the Vizier would peruse them; tho' as appears by the sequel his Intentions were to make them pay their Ransom as our Capitulations had done before; which the Dutch objected against us, as a leading Card to them, and that our easiness in yielding to such an un∣parallell'd Extortion, had given the Vizier Encouragment to enterprise the like upon them. It was in the year 1610, when the Dutch first made their Capitulations with the Turks; since which time they were but once renewed, about Forty six years ago in the time of Sultan Morat; and then their Articles were not described at large in many Points, only in general it was declared, That they should extend to all the Particulars as largely, and in as ample a manner, to all Privi∣leges and Immunities, as did the English. The Vizier upon Consideration of the mat∣ter, was not willing to find particulars in generals, nor to interpret Articles with such vast Comprehensions as divers & caetera's would imply; and therefore told the Dutch, That they must either receive their Capitula∣tions back, with such Concessions only, as were expressed in open Terms; or otherwise be contented with the expence of renewing of them, in such an Explicite manner as might refer nothing to an interpretation out of Ge∣nerals. The Dutch who were contented with their old Capitulations, and affrighted with the Charge of new ones, knowing how apt the Vizier was to inflame the Reckoning, kept off at a distance for some time, Ar∣guing the unreasonableness of such a Con∣straint, and the validity of their present Articles, than which they desired no others. Howsoever, the Vizier kept the Capitu∣lations, and the Customer interpreted them after his own Sence, and in his own Favour. The Dutch had at that time several Ships under Convoy of their State's Men of War arrived at Smyrna, to which they gave Orders not to enter the Port, but to lie off without the Castle, as if they intended to break off all Commerce; and in case their Capitulations were not restored, to cause their Fleet to return back to the Ports from whence they came. But the Vizier and the Customer were not moved with this Bravade; for tho' they were not very well versed in Maritine, or Mercantile affairs, yet they were not ignorant how far a Master of a Ship was obliged to deliver the Goods laden on his Vessel at the Port, to which they were designed; nor did they unreasonably calculate the Charge of returning the Con∣voy.
with the loss and overthrow of their Voyage, to be far greater than the Bar∣gain which was to be made for Restitution, or renewal of their Capitulations. Howsoe∣ver, the Dutch were of Opinion, That this Suspension of Trade would mortifie the Customer, and incline the Vizier to better Terms; when after Fifty days hanging off, and that divers great Ships of their Convoy had lain almost all that time upon an ex∣pensive and heavy demorage; at length the Resident being sooner weary thereof, than the Turks were sensible of the failure of Trade, became desirous to Treat about an Accommodation. The person employ'd here∣in was the Vizier's own Jew Broker, (for all the great Men in Turky have one of this Race depending on their Families, who serve them for Setters and Pandors to their interest and pleasures.) This Jew being dex∣terous in his mystery of making Bargains, concluded with the Dutch to have their Ca∣pitulations renewed; and to have all the dubious Points explained and distended at large, in the same manner as the English are: And then in satisfaction, and return for so favourable an Indulgence, Fifty purses of Money were to be paid to the Vizier, Ten to his Kaja, Three to the Reis-Effendi, or Chief Secretary, and Eight to Usaine Aga the Customer: After which Orders were sent to the Convoy to enter within the Port of Smyrna, which might have been done at first without expence or loss of time; for certainly the detention of the Convoy ser∣ved nothing to the easier, and more ready Accommodation of this Affair. I have known many Examples of this nature in my own time in Turky; and could never find that the stopping Ships from entering into Port, did ever Operate upon the Tur∣kish Officers, and only served to increase our Expence, and add to the Afflictions of our other Aggrievances, which we received from the Turks. Thus did the Vizier Treat all the Mini∣sters of Foreign Princes with a Scorn, and Contempt as became such as were his Vas∣sals, or Tributaries to his Master, neither showing them Respect or Honour, nor af∣fording them Justice: And when at any time an injured Ambassador asked of him the Rea∣sons why he was so severely used, and what Crime he had committed, he would readily answer, Do you not Breath in the Grand Seig∣niors Air, and will you pay him nothing for it? Wherefore we may not wonder, that the Venetians on the Provocations be∣fore-mention'd, should in so few years after the Conclusion of a long War, break out again with the Turk, and joyn with the Em∣peror against this Common Enemy, whom neither Articles, nor Solemn Promises could keep within the Bounds of Common Hu∣manity. And when we consider, how the just God doth humble the Proud, we may not wonder to see how manifestly, the Di∣vine Providence hath appeared in Defence of the Christian Cause, even to a Miracle against the Turks, who at that time had exalted themselves to such a pitch of Pride, and Opinion of their own Force, as if they had been Omnipotent and Invincible, and were minded to verifie their own saying, That God had made the Earth for their Domi∣nion, and Enjoyment, and the Sea only for the Christians. Thus had Pride, Rapine and Avarice ari∣sen to their Zenith and highest Sphere unto which they could reach, and all those Cor∣ruptions and Irregularities in Justice, which usually overthrow Kingdoms and Empires seem'd now to be consummated, and the Governors to have fulfill'd the measure of their Iniquity. Luxury and Lasciviousness may weaken and enervate a People, but Tyranny and Injustice most commonly Sub∣vert the whole Fabrick of Government. Avarice, which is the root of all Evils, and which provokes and incites to Tyranny and Violence, was the ruine of the Ottoman Em∣pire; of which we shall produce a most pregnant Example in the Conduct of this Vizier, when we come to Treat of his Con∣duct in the succeeding War, before he laid Siege to the City of Vienna. ANNO, 1681. WE are entred now into another year,A. D. 1681. and still the Visier continues un∣changeable in his violent Resolutions of getting and amassing vast Sums of Money. He had for some time given a little respite to the Christian Ministers, from whom he had diverted his exactions to exercise them on the Turks themselves; he laid an Imposi∣tion of two Aspers upon every Oke of Flesh eaten within the City;An Oke is 2 l. ¾ English. of which an Old Man complaining, who was employ'd to buy Flesh for the Janizaries, as being dear and bad, the Vizier turn'd him out of his Of∣fice, with a Reward of 300 blows on the Soles of his Feet. The Grand Seignior having built a Se∣raglio on Galata side, near the Bosphorus, many of the Workmen, and poor Labourers, both Turks and Christians not being pay'd, gave a Petition to the Grand Seignior for their Money; the Grand Seignior readily gave them an Assignment under his own hand for their Payment, directed to the Tefterday or Lord Treasurer; but he sent them to the Vizier, who clap'd twenty three of them into Prison, and next day in publick Divan, order'd them to be drubb'd;
telling them, That if he heard more of their Complaints, he would send them to the Gal∣lies. But all these were petty Matters in Com∣parison with that greater Design he had of raising Money; which was by laying a Tax on all Lands throughout the Empire, call'd the Sorsat, whereby it was propos'd to levy at least fourteen thousand Purses, of which the Vizier made an account of at least two thousand for his own share; (the Sorsat is the greatest Tax the Turks impose on their People, being laid on every Acre of Glebe Land where the Plow goes.) The pretence for which was, the Grand Seignior's Remo∣val to Adrianople, for adjusting the Limits of Poland. But this Design was disappoint∣ed by the contrary Faction of the Kuzlir Aga, and Solyman Kaja, who by the Queen Mother represented to the Grand Seignior, that this Journey being only of Pleasure, and not design'd in order to a War, he could not without an oppression of his Peo∣ple raise such a Tax, which in former times was never Levied by their Wisest Emperors, but on great Emergencies, and on occasion of pressing Exigencies; so the Grand Seig∣nior, like a good Prince, gave answer to the Vizier, That he would spare his Subjects for the present, in regard that he, and the Valide Sultana, had sufficient in the Treasury where∣with to defray their own Expences. Howsoever the Vizier still insisted on this Point, arguing that the intent of removal to Adrianople was not a Journey of Pleasure; but (if the Grand Seignior so pleas'd) in order to a War against the Emperor of Ger∣many; for never was there a Conjuncture more favourable than at present, when the Rebels under the Command of Count Teckeley invited them to a Conquest of all that Countrey; and particularly of Raab, which having been formerly under the Do∣minion of the Turks, could not without dishonour to the Empire, and scandal to Re∣ligion be relinquish'd, and suffer'd to remain in the hands of the Christians, when it might without much blood or expence be recover'd. To which the Grand Seignior made answer, That Raab had not been lost in his days, nor in the Reigns of his Father, or Uncle, and therefore that the recovery thereof did less concern him; and that for his own part, he had sufficiently enlarg'd his Em∣pire by the addition of Newhawsel, Candia, Caminiee, Ukrania, and the appurtenances thereunto belonging; the which Conquests had so harassed his Souldiers, and burthen'd his People, that he was resolv'd to put an end unto his Wars, and give repose and ease unto his Dominions. At present there was neither Peace with the Moscovites, nor open Wars; the Trea∣ties were in a manner ended, no great Pre∣parations were making for the following year,Things doubtful with Mos∣covy. but every thing remain'd in a kind of suspense; and in this Condition of Affairs the Vizier advis'd the Grand Seignior to re∣move with his Court unto Adrianople in a Warlike posture, which might alarm the Moscovites, and incline them to better Terms and Articles of Peace. The Grand Seignior assented thereunto, and about the beginning of November arriv'd at Adrianople. But before the Vizier was well setled in that City, he was forc'd for his own safety to cut off his belov'd Kaja, a Creature of his own, who was admirably fitted for his purpose; for he was grown so scandalously avaritious, and so publickly rapacious, without any fear or shame, that he was hated and detested by all Mankind. And here, if ever, the Curse of David was re∣ally fulfill'd of him and his Master; Let a Wicked Man be set over them, and let Satan stand at his right hand. And tho' the Vizier had no great need of a Tempter to pro∣voke or incite him to catch at his Prey, yet this Devil being most excellently Saga∣cious in finding out and starting Game, and skilful in all the Arts of Intriguing, he was most intimate and dear to his Master, and esteem'd the more useful Instrument, be∣cause he was so bold as to be content to bear the disgrace, and to stand between the Vizier, and the Clamours of the People; which were now become so common, and general by the out-cries of the multi∣tude, that the Vizier to save himself, was forc'd to offer him a Sacrifice to their tu∣multuous rage. The occasion was this. The last Summer the Grand Seignior at the instigation of the Mufti, and of other Zealots of the Mahometan-Law, had issued out divers severe Edicts against Taverns, and Boza-Shops. This Boza is a certain sort of Liquor made of that Grain which by us is call'd Millet, which is fumatick,The Cause that mov'd the Vizier to cut off his Kaja. and as inebriating as our strongest Ale; and with which the Turks would be as drunk, and more quarrelsom and mutinous than if they had drank of the juice of the Grape; and therefore the Ulamah, or Expositors of their Law, gave their Opinions that it was as unlawful as Wine; for that since it was their Prophet's intention to prohibit Drun∣kenness, it was an illusion of his Precept to forbid Wine, and at the same time to allow of other more intoxicating and inebriating Liquors; wherefore as often as the Grand Seignior renew'd his Decrees against Wine, he enjoyn'd the same Penalties against drink∣ing Boza, which was a very heavy and grievous Lesson to the People; for Boza-shops were become almost as common in Turkey, as Ale-houses are in England, and to suppress
them, would be a like inconvenience. Wherefore upon return of the Grand Seig∣nior last year unto Constantinople, the Boza-Housekeepers made their Addresses to the Vizier for a Dispensation with the Sultan's Decree and License to sell Boza publickly as before; the Kaja boldly enters into a Treaty, and concludes with them for sixty Purses, which so soon as the Grand Seignior was de∣parted were paid, and the License given, and the Cape, or Chief of that Trade was with Ceremony vested by the Chimacam, who came also into a share of the benefit. But this matter could not long remain a Se∣cret before it was made known to the Sul∣tan by the contrary Faction to the Vizier, who having the good fortune to have Kara Kaja his Friend then present when the Com∣plaint was made; at which he observing the Grand Seignior to grow very angry, imme∣diately interpos'd in behalf of the Vizier, ex∣cusing him as ignorant in the matter, and that none was guilty therein besides Hassan the Vizier's Kaja, who was the sole Actor and Contriver of the Offence. The Grand Seignior, who had always been constant to his prime Minister, was willing to see him cover'd with such a screen, and without far∣ther delay Sign'd a Command to take off the head of the Kaja, which was dispatch'd away by the Salahor, or Chief of the Quer∣ries belonging to the Stables. Kara Kaja a very bad Man, who was Friend to the Vi∣zier, dispatch'd with all expedition this Ad∣vice unto him; which he having receiv'd, and fearing left his Kaja should be carried away alive to the Grand Seignior, and be∣tray the whole truth of their Combination, not staying for the Command, immediately order'd him to be strangled. It was early in the Morning when the Letter came, and at the same moment the Vizier sent for Ali Aga, who had been Talkishgee to the late Vizier, (that is the Officer who carries Messages to the Grand Seignior) and then Agent at the Port for the Tartar Han, and bid him go to Hassan Kaja and take his Place. Ali Aga surpriz'd and confus'd with this direction, went as he was order'd, and whilst he was speaking to Hassan, and telling him that he did not well un∣derstand the Vizier's Pleasure, in came the Master of the Ceremonies with a Vest, with which (after the Turkish fashion) he Cloathed Ali Aga, bidding Hassan to retire into the inward Chamber; where being entred,The Viziers Kaja strangled. two lusty Arnouts, who were sel∣ling Cimnels in the Streets, were brought up and order'd to strangle him; the Cord was thrown down before him, which seeming stiff, and not prepar'd to slip easily, he desir'd his Executioners to make use of his own Girdle. But before he dy'd, he instantly urg'd that it might be permitted him to see the Vizier, to whom he had many things of Importance to Communi∣cate. But it would not be granted; and as the Cord was putting about his neck, he Cursed the Vizier, saying these last words; O Treacherous World, now I know thee! Be∣ing a strong Man he was long in dying; and some few hours after his Execution be∣ing observ'd to move, the Vizier order'd the Principal Gaoler to watch him until he was Enterr'd. And so was the Grand Seignior's Sentence forestal'd, for he was in his Grave before that arriv'd. After his death, the next thing was to ransack his Houses, where great Riches were found, both in Furniture, Clothing, Jewels, and Money; he had four hundred and twenty Horses in his Stables; to the Meri or Exchequer fifteen hundred Purses of his Money were brought, but his Hou∣ses and Lands were assign'd to pay his Debts, all which he had gain'd in the space of three years. In one of his new Houses he had enclosed forty thousand Chequins within a Wall, which his Steward discover'd, and that he had murther'd the poor Masons whom he had employ'd in the Work. When this Vizier was Chimacam, (as he was for several years) this Man was once his Kaja, but he was so shameless a Villain, that his Master drubb'd him, and turn'd him out of his Service. Howsoever, being now Vizier, and knowing that he had need of such an Instrument, he took him again into the same Office; and calling to Mind that when he was Pasha of Silistria, in the time of Old Kuperlee, he sav'd himself by cutting off another Kaja, he reserv'd this Rogue for the same purpose. The new Kaja was a much better Man, and therefore little confided in by the Vi∣zier, and consequently made no great Fi∣gure at his Court; his Chief Confident now was the Reis-Essendi, or Principal Secretary, by whose hands all Treaties and Negotia∣tions pass'd. In short, by these Arts and Means the Vizier kept up his Credit with his Master, and in despight of the Faction which was against him, he stood firm on his Basis, such was the favour and constan∣cy of the Sultan to his prime Ministers. On the twenty third of November, Caplan Pasha, who had for some years been Capitan Pasha, and of whom we have had occasion to make mention often in our former History, died at Smyrna, being grown almost to a Dotage; he had just such another Kaja as the Vizier had, who miserably pillag'd and oppress'd the poor Islanders in the Archipelago, from whom he extorted two hundred Purses; such another Sum would totally have ruin'd them.
A Page of the Grand Seignior's, who was Selictar-Aga, or Sword-bearer succeeded in the great charge of Capitan-Pasha, or High Admiral of the Naval Forces, he was a Cre∣ature of the Viziers, and Born in the same Town with him; by whom his Party was strengthen'd against the contrary Fa∣ction. At this time the Vizier was meditating a War against the Emperor; but having diffe∣rences with Poland and Moscovy on his Hands, as yet not decided, there being neither an open War nor a declar'd peace as yet with ei∣ther,The Vizier designs a War on the Emperor. he resolved so soon as possible to bring Matters unto an Accommodation with them both: And having made Peace with all the World, and super-induced a calmness over the Face of all the Ottoman Empire, he might then have a pretence to break out into a new War against the Emperor; to which tho' he might meet an aversion in the Grand Seignior for the Causes before menti∣on'd, and in the Mufti, and Viziers of the Bench, upon the Truce which wanted Two years of being expir'd; yet having such a favourable conjuncture of Affairs to offer, than which nothing could be more inviting, he assur'd himself that he should prevail with the Grand Seignior and his Chief Ministers; and herein he missed not his aim, for lay∣ing before them the Successes of the Malecon∣tents in Hungary, who were powerful and strong, and had of themselves worsted the Emperor's Forces in all their Battels and Skirmishes: And that these People declar'd their intentions to throw off their Obedience and Allegiance to the Emperor, and offer'd themselves Subjects, and Tributaries to the Grand Seignior, on the easy and reasonable Condition only of affording them his Assi∣stance, and granting them his Protection: So that to let slip this favourable opportuni∣ty, on the Nice point of a Truce not yet expir'd, were, said he, to give up the Mahome∣tan Cause; the advance and increase of which were a sufficient ground to hallow any thing, which may stand in opposition to it. There were other things also alledg'd, in reference to secret Encouragements given from France, which tho' they carried not such weight with the Council, so as to depend on them, yet they served for probable in∣ducements to incite forward unto a War. With which Reasons the Grand Seignior and the Council being convinced, a War was determin'd, and great preparations made in order thereunto. And now in regard we are come to a Crisis of time, which gave a turn to the successes of the Turks, and hath shaken and almost subverted the whole Fabrick of the Ottoman Empire; it may not be an im∣pertinent digression to look back to the Troubles of Hungary, which were the Causes and Original of that War, which hath prov'd fatal to the Turks, and brought the King∣dom of Hungary under the entire and abso∣lute Dominion of the Christian Emperor: We shall therefore give a succinct Account of the beginning of those Troubles, as re∣ported by the Author of that Tract called Vienna Oppugnata, adjoyned at the end of the History of Isthuanus formerly Vice-Palatine of Hungary, whose words are to this purpose. The Turks having in the Month of Au∣gust 1664. received an Overthrow with the Slaughter of 10000 Men near St. Gothards,The Origi∣nal of the Troubles in Hungary. a Town in Hungary, by the Imperial Army, un∣der the Conduct and Command of Raymond Montecuculi, a Peace or Truce rather was immediately concluded thereupon, to continue for the space of Twenty years: During which time the Kingdom of Hungary long harassed with War, might have recover'd its pristin happy Estate, had not certain Miscreants, the barbarous and degenerate offspring of that Country, disturbed the Tranquillity and Quiet thereof; and by Machinations and Plots a∣gainst the Life of their Sovereign, drawn upon themselves that destruction which they design'd for others. But God be praised, their Treason was detected, and the chief Conspirators, name∣ly, Francis Count Nadasti, Chief Justice of Hungary, Francis Marquis of Frangipani, and Peter Serini a Count of Croatia, all of them Eminent both for Arms and Letters, were taken, arraign'd, and being found Guilty were put to Death, and their Goods and E∣states confiscated to the use of the Emperor. But so soon as this Rebellion was suppressed, another of more dangerous consequence was raised, being fomented by the Nobility, and Persons most considerable for their Estates and Power in Hungary, of which Emericus Count Tekeli was declar'd the Chief; the Causes and Grounds of which they deliver'd under these Heads. First, That contrary to the Laws and Con∣stitutions of the Kingdom, a Palatine had not been constituted to supply the vacancy of the former deceased. Secondly, That the Hungarians were exclu∣ded from all Offices and places of Trust, and Strangers introduced into their stead. Thirdly, That the German Troops were forcibly quarter'd upon them, and the numbers daily increased: And all the Forts, Castles, and places of defence garrison'd by German Soldiers, and no Trust or Confidence reposed in the Hungarians, to the great oppression and discouragement of that People. Fourthly, That by the Counsel and Advice of the Jesuits, the free exercise of their Reli∣gion was not only taken from them, but they were also ejected out of their Churches and places where they worshipped God: For which
Reason they desired, that the Jesuits might be banished out of Hungary. And tho' the Emperor did in his Wisdom fore-see all the mischiefs which did ensue, and with a gracious Clemency endeavour'd to apply those Lenitives, which might appease the Spirits of his discontented Subjects; and in order thereunto called a Diet to be held at Cassovia, where he offer'd to condescend unto all the Propositions which the Malecontents did demand: And afterwards summoned ano∣ther Diet to be held at Presburg, at which, before the Coronation of the Queen, he assisted and presided in Person, and there made new offers to grant Liberty of Conscience, and a free exercise of Religion to all Protestants, and to restore to them their Churches taken from them, with as many other Privileges and Favours as could be desir'd: So that there was all appearance imaginable of Peace and a fair Accommodation. But matters were per∣mitted to go too far before they received a Check: For the Malecontents were engaged with the Turks beyond any power of retractation: And having received Assurances from them of Assistances which were daily expected, and Pro∣mises (as it is said) of Money from the French, all thoughts of accommodation were laid aside, from whence that terrible War hath ensued, fatal to the Turks and pernicious to Christendom. All this is a short Epitome of the Trou∣bles and Unquietnesses in Hungary, for the space of about Eighteen years, which having been the occasion of the great War, which hath alter'd the state of the whole World; We shall not content over selves with this short Relation, but shall proceed to render an Account of the rise of these Troubles, the continuance of them, with the several Successes, until the Entire conquest of Hun∣gary by the Emperor. The People of Hungary are naturally of a mutinous and unquit Temper, complaining of War, and not well contented with Peace. The Emperor towards the end of the Cam∣paign 1664. had gain'd a Victory (as is said) over the Turks, and made the good use thereof, as with that opportunity to clap up a Peace. The Hungarians who be∣fore that time, and even during the War with the Turk, bad been unseasonably incen∣sed by many Insults and Outrages commit∣ted on them by the German Soldiers; but more sensibly touched by having their Churches taken from them by the Counsel, and advice of the Jesuits and Clergy of Rome; were not content with the Peace made by the Emperor with the Grand Seignior: Alledging that they ought to have been made Par∣ties to the Treaty, it being their Country which was chiefly concern'd: That after so Signal a Victory, better and more advantage∣ous Articles might have been obtain'd from the Turk, and perhaps Newhawsel it self might have been Surrender'd and Restored, but by default hereof their Condition was render'd far worse than before, for by vertue of the new Articles lately concluded: The Pasha of Newhawsel pretended to bring all the Vil∣lages on the Frontiers of Moravia under Con∣tribution; and to add unto the new Con∣quests all the Country and places on this side the Danube, which are nearly adjoyn∣ing to Gran, Alba-Regalis and Kanisia, where∣in was comprehended the greatest part of the lower Hungary: Which they exclaimed against as Terms so disagreeable unto them, that a War had been much better; and there∣fore to prevent and disappoint all farther pro∣ceedings thereon, they seized on the Secre∣tary of the Imperial Resident then remaining with the Vizier, on the way as he was car∣rying the Articles of Peace to be Ratify'd by the Emperor, and took from him his Horses and Money with his Dispatches, which they for some time detain'd, and re∣stored not without much difficulty. The Emperor being inform'd of this Af∣front, cited the Chief Lords of Hungary to appear at Vienna: Where the Prince Lukovitz President of the Imperial Council told them, That the Conditions of Peace which his Ma∣ster the Emperor had concluded with the Turk, were not so disadvantageous as they imagin'd; for that the first overture of Peace came from the Turks themselves, with whom it was a∣greed and concluded, that Transilvania was to continue in its ancient Liberty, and not sub∣jected to the Government of a Pasha in nature of a Mahometan Province. That the Counties of Zatmar and Zambolish, which were anci∣ently esteem'd dependencies on Transilvania, were to be transferr'd into the power of the Emperor. That the better to secure the Fron∣tiers of the upper Hungary, and to prevent the Incursions of the Turks on the other side of the Danube, It was provided in the Capi∣tulations, that the Emperor might Build Forts on each side of the River Waagh; which would very much annoy and restrain the Turks of Waradin and Newhawsel from making De∣predations, or Incursions on that side of the Country. Now considering that this Peace was thus advantageous, as well to Hungary as to the Hereditary Dominions; his Imperial Majesty judged it convenient to embrace so fair an opportunity; expecting that the Hun∣garian Lords would likewise concur with him in Confirmation of the Treaty, and restrain their Soldiers from committing farther Out∣rages on the Frontiers. That his Imperial Majesty as to his part, was resolved to with∣draw all his German Regiments out of Hun∣gary; Provided, That they themselves would take care to furnish, and supply those Garri∣sons
with Soldiers of their own, and at their own charge repair the Fortifications of Le∣vents, Schentra, Neutra, Schella and Gutta, which are Neighbouring places to Newhawsel, and to furnish them with all sorts of Ammu∣nition, and Provisions necessary for their Main∣tenance and Defence. The Hungarian Lords returned no pre∣sent answer to this Discourse; having not Authority so to do, until they had first con∣sulted with the Nobility of the Upper Hun∣gary, who had often protested that they would never agree to any thing, which was concluded without their consent, and re∣venge themselves on their Palatine, in case he should engage them in matters without their Privity or Concurrence first ob∣tain'd. In fine, after Consultations had with the Estates, an answer was giving in Writing to this effect. That to conclude a Peace without the Privity and Concurrence of the Estates, was against the Statutes, and Privileges of the Kingdom. That in case they could flatter themselves so far, as to believe that true Tranquillity and Ease would be the effect, and consequence of the late Truce made with the Turk, which would be the greatest blessing that could befal a Nation, (which above all the People in this World had been harassed with War:) Yet it was difficult, and almost un∣practicable for them to build the Fortresses in∣tended upon the Waagh, and in the mean time restrain the Turks from their Incursions; and let them do what was possible for them, yet still Hungary would lie open, and exposed for at least 60 Leagues space to the Incursions of the Turks, and to the extortions and in∣solences of the German Soldiers: In short therefore, they resolved to Ratify nothing; they would neither exchange the Garrisons nor Build new Forts, nor Repair old ones; but leave every thing to his Majesty to provide what was necessary for the defence, and con∣servation of that miserable and unfortunate Kingdom. This memorial being given in with a kind of sad and a discontented behaviour, de∣spairing (as it were) of the welfare of their Country; the Hungarians were retiring from the Emperor and his Council, when the Prince Lubkovitz reassum'd in a calm and sober manner his former Discourse, which he pressed on them with new and perswa∣sive Instances: Telling them, That he could not imagin upon what Grounds or Reasons they did desire a continuance of War, the Stage and Theater of which was to be their own Country. That out of a sence of those Miseries which were to ensue, and from a pious and gracious regard he conceived for the repose of Hungary, the Emperor had concluded a Peace with the Turk, which he was contriving to secure against all violences and irruptions of the Enemy. And that entire satisfaction might be given to the Hungarian Lords, his Imperial Majesty de∣clar'd, That he would build those Forts upon the Waagh, which were design'd to restrain all Incursions from the Garrison of Newhausel,The Em∣peror's Grant to the Hun∣garians. at his own expence and charge: That he would withdraw the German Troops from burdening the Country, and quarter Hungarians in their places; That whilest these Forts were in Build∣ing, the Guards thereunto belonging should con∣sist of Hussars and Heydukes: That all places of Trust and Profit, both Civil and Military, should be put into the Hands of Hungarians. And that they might at their own will and pleasure, put what Forces and Commanders they pleased into the Garrisons of the Moun∣tain Towns and other places. These Concessions from the Emperor be∣ing so gracious and free, as nothing could be desir'd more ample and satisfactory; the Hungarian Lords acquiesced and signed the Treaty with the Turks: So that all things began to put on a Face, and clear aspect of Tranquillity and Repose, as well in refe∣rence unto Foreign Wars, as to civil and in∣testine differences: And thereupon the Crown, wherewith the Hungarian Kings were usually Crown'd, and which the Lords had removed from Presburg, to prevent the Emperor from taking it upon him with Right of Inheritance, was again return'd by them, and restor'd to its former place. But these fair promises and assurances given by the Prince Lubkovitz in behalf of the Emperor, proceeded no farther than to words, for neither were their Churches re∣stor'd; Nor the German Forces recalled out of the Country; Nor the Towns of Ni∣tria and Levents, lately taken from the Turks deliver'd into their Hands, as was promised: But instead thereof, German Gar∣risons were put into Tokai, Zatmar, Kalo and Onod, Towns which are bordering on Transilvania, and were belonging to Prince Ragotski. In short, nothing being perform'd as was promised, the Spirits of the Hungarians were so exasperated, that they desponded of any good from the Imperial Court, but rather beheld it as a Cabal, contriving and medi∣tating only to bring them under an Arbi∣trary power, and an unsupportable Slavery. And this general Humour of discontent, so spread it self in the Minds of the People; that they grew Sullen, and Angry in an Instant; and both the Roman Catholicks and Protestants, and all sorts of Religions in that Nation became so concern'd for the Liberty and Privileges of their Country; that they freely and openly declar'd, That they would rather subject themselves to the Turks, than become the Slaves of the Germans.
The consequences of which War have been so dismal, and even the Imperial Victo∣ries gain'd at the expence of so much Blood and Treasure, as all Germany as well as Hungary, has felt the fatal effects of it: So that Men are apt to look back with In∣dignation on the Authors of these Troubles, and to think them worthy of the extreamest Punishments, that have brought their Coun∣try to such Ruin and Desolation. The greatest part of which Censures will without doubt fall upon the Protestants, whose Arms have wanted even Success; that popular justification, and whose Cause labours under two such fearful appearances, as a defection from their Prince, and the joyning with the Common Enemy of Chri∣stendom, tho' perhaps a considering Man will be apt to reflect on that Cruel severity, which forc'd them to take shelter in the Arms of an Infidel; at least he will see a fatal instance, of the unhappy Consequen∣ces of driving Men to Despair, by subver∣ting their Laws, Liberties and Religion. I shall therefore give an impartial Account of the Causes, that exasperated the Pro∣testants of Hungary to this degree; and leave them to the Readers judgment, either to be condemn'd or acquitted. And there∣fore let us hear what Account the Prote∣stant Writers give of this matter; when the Protestant Religion began first to insinuate it self into Hungary, under the Reign of King Lewis,Anno. 1523. it met there with the same fate it did in other Countrys, (viz.) Opposition and Persecution. But this King unhappily engaging himself in a War against the Turks, fell in Battle, and leaving no Heir Male, the Hungarian Nobility were divided in the choice of a Successor; one part Ele∣cting John Zapolya Vaivode of Transilvania, and the other Ferdinand the first. But John dying soon after his Election, Ferdinand re∣main'd in sole possession of that Kingdom; who the better to gain the affection of his Subjects, granted free exercise of Religion to Cassovia, Bartphia, Eperias, Leuchenia and Libinia; the five free Towns of upper Hungary, and afterwards to several of the Towns of lower Hungary, besides the same Privileges which he gave to divers of the Nobility. Notwithstanding which, there being several Commotions and Disturban∣ces on account of Religion, still remaining in the year 1606. at the Pacification of Vienna, made between Rodolph Emperor and King of Hungary, and Stephen Botscai-Kis-Maria; in the first Article it was said, That as to the business of Religion, that notwith∣standing the first Constitutions, and the last Article of the year 1604. according the Resolu∣tion taken by his Imperial Majesty: All the Inhabitants and Persons of what Order or Con∣dition soever within that Kingdom, as well the great Lords, as the Cities and Privileg'd Towns immediately belonging to the Crown, or upon the borders of that Kingdom; as like∣wise all the Soldiers of Hungary, shall have free and entire Liberty of Conscience, without being troubled or molested: Nevertheless with∣out prejudice to the Roman Catholick Religion, so that that Clergy, the Churches, and the Tem∣ples of the Catholicks may remain in the State wherein they are, without Violation or Mole∣station: And that those which had been taken by one side or other, should be restor'd to their lawful owners. Afterwards the Emperor Mat∣thias himself explain'd that Clause, (never∣theless without prejudice to the Rom. Cath. Religion) by assuring them, That it was put in upon a good design, and that it only meant that neither Party should be disturbed in the exercise of their Religion. This liberty was afterwards often confirm'd, as you may see in the Grievances presented to the Empe∣ror, which are affix'd to the end of this Hi∣story. The now Reigning Emperor Leopold solemnly confirm'd this Article at his Coro∣nation; Vide the sixth Condition in the Imperial Patent running thus: Ordered, That the exercise of Religion granted to the States of Hungary, according to the Constitution of Vienna, and those Articles establisht before our Coronation shall re∣main entirely free, as well for the Barons, Lords, Gentlemen, as free Cities, and all Orders and States of the Kingdom of Hungary; as likewise for the Towns, Vil∣lages and Hamlets that will accept of it, so that no Person of what Condition soe∣ver, shall be hinder'd in the exercise of his Religion, in what manner, or under what pretence soever. Given in the Royal Ci∣tadel of Posonium, June the 25th, 1655. In despight of all these Edicts made in favour of the Protestants; the Clergy, espe∣cially the Jesuits, had so much interest in the Court of Vienna, as to get a Manifest pub∣lish'd there; and Entitled, Truth declared to all the World, or a Treatise wherein is pro∣ved by three Argument, that his Caesarean Majesty is not obliged to tolerate the Lu∣theran, or Calvinist Religion in the King∣dom of Hungary: Writ by George Barzon titular Bishop of Waradin, Priest of the So∣ciety, and Councellor to his Sacred Majesty. The first Argument was drawn from three Conditions, under which the liberty of Re∣ligion was granted at the Pacification of Vienna. The first, That it should be with out prejudice to the Protestant Religion, which Condition being impossible ought to pass for nothing. The second, "That the Clergy, and the Catholick Churches should remain in their former Condition without being toucht, which was viola∣ted
by Bethlem and Ragotski. The third; That what was taken either by one side or the other should be restor'd, which the Protestants had not perform'd. To this was answered, That it did by no means follow, that if one Condition or Clause was lookt upon as impossible, and so null, that the whole Treaty should be so also; and besides, that the Emperor Matthias himself had explain'd the Condition by declaring, that it was not to be made use of for the ruining of that liberty which was granted. That whatsoever Bethlem or Ragotski had done, this Liberty was not∣withstanding confirm'd by the Edicts and Ordinances of the Emperor: That if it had been so, that Protestants, who being daily provok'd by the Papists, had gone a little too far, yet the innocent ought not to suffer. That the Destruction of Tem∣ples, which were made use of during the Troubles only regarded those, that Bot∣skai had taken in the War, and not such as had been for a long time in their Hands. The second Argument is, "That this liberty was not establisht by the unanimous consent of the States of the Kingdom, to whom it belongs to make Laws with the Consent and Approba∣tion of his Majesty, and consequently that those Articles ought to be abolisht. But it was urg'd, that this was extreamly injurious to those Kings, who had con∣firm'd and ratify'd them, and who no question were not so ignorant of the rights of the Kingdom of Hungary. That when this Affair was manag'd at Lintz 1645. Tho' the Arch-Bishop of Strigonium, George Lippai, and some seculars opposed it, yet Count Palfy President of the Chamber, and divers Catholick Lords consented, not∣withstanding that opposition; so that the Affair, being extreamly hindred by that Arch-Bishop and his adherents, the Pro∣testants were upon the point of complain∣ing to his Majesty, had they not been stopt by the Declaration that was made, that they voluntarily subscribed to the Articles of the Pacification of Vienna, which they called the Foundation of the Kingdom: So that this Edict of Lintz was ratify'd and inserted in the Articles of the year 1647 with this Clause, Not∣withstanding the opposition of the Clergy and other Seculars, which shall have no force or vigour for the future. Besides the Subscription of the Pacification of Vienna, made by all the States both Ecclesiastick and Civil, runs thus: We underwritten do, with common consent, in the name of all the States and Orders of the Kingdom of Hungary, and the places annex'd to it, promise freely and voluntarily, &c. The third Argument was, That if the Luthe∣rans and Calvinists must be tolerated, then those only must be tolerated, which are of the Confession of Ausbourg, and the Confession of the Swisses: But both one and the other had abandon'd those Confessions; and they instanced in several Articles from which they had de∣viated. But this last seems only a frivo∣lous shift, and shews the Resolution the Clergy had taken to oppress the Protestants; and indeed this they had always done, when they thought themselves the stron∣ger, and notwithstanding, that this Liberty was often confirm'd, as particularly in the Treaties with Botskai, Bethlem and Prince Ragotski; yet the Roman Catholick Lords and Gentlemen, and especially the Arch-Bishops and Bishops, persecuted them with Fire and Sword, massacr'd them in their Churches; and used all manner of Cruel∣ties towards them, as far as their Power and Authority could reach; so that there remain'd scarce any place of Rest, or Secu∣rity for the Protestants, but in the free Cities, and those too quickly after were in∣volved in the same misfortune: For Nadasti, Serini, Frangipani, and other Catholick Lords taking part with Prince Ragotski a∣gainst the Emperor, in the year 1670. the Austrian Troops entr'd Hungary and carried all before them, and with them Troops of Bishops, Arch-Bishops and Je∣suits, whose Actions out-did the Fury of the Soldiers; and took this opportunity of dispoiling the Protestants of their Goods, Churches, Ministers, and constrain'd a great part of the People to change their Religi∣on: The Protestant Lords were tax'd at im∣mense Sums, Soldiers quarter'd upon them, and by these means several forc'd to turn Catholicks. In short, all Upper and Lower Hungary with all the Free Towns, fell in∣to the Hands of the Catholicks, whose Se∣verities and Cruelties, as they found no∣thing to oppose them, so they suffer'd no∣thing to escape them: And this miserable Kingdom labour'd at once under the Li∣cence and Rapine of the German Soldiers, and the Rage and Fury of the Jesuitical Con∣verters. The Protestants were hang'd up at their Church Gates, and several of their Towns burnt. One John Backi a Minister, was burnt a live at Comarin, and the Wi∣dow of Laurent le Sur, who was of the same Profession, had her Head cut off in the same Town: And multitudes of both Sexes, and all Ages and Conditions were banish'd.—To Authorize these Cruelties, at least to give them a fair gloss, they con∣stituted a Chamber of Justices at Poson, compos'd of Ecclesiasticks and Seculars, all sworn Enemies to the Protestants; where
it was first order'd, That the most considerable Persons should be cited to appear, and clear themselves of the Crime of Rebellion laid to their charge. They began with those of the Nobility, which they thought the easi∣est to be wrought upon. They which made their appearance were thrown into Prison, without being judicially heard, condemn'd to great Fines, and were each minute solici∣ted to change their Religion. A Declara∣tion was presented to those whom they found most firm and constant, whereby they were required, that to satisfy his Imperial Majesty of their Loyalty and Obedience, they should no longer protect their Ministers, and should promise not to hinder the Priests from saying Mass in their Churches, or perform∣ing other Ecclesiastical Functions, till they were enlightn'd from above, saw their Errors, and were converted to the Catholick Church. But the greatest Storm fell upon the Mi∣nisters, at whom they chiefly aim'd; and that they might get rid of them the better, they establish'd three Courts of Judicature: One at Tirnavia for those of Poson, and two at Poson for the rest of Hungary: Nor were they all cited for fear of making too much noise, but a few and those of the Ausbourg Confession, to try what success they were like to expect from the Prosecu∣tion of the rest: And, because they chiefly design'd to ruin the Protestant Religion, under pretence of Rebellion, they pre∣sented those that appear'd these following Articles to sign. 1st, That all the Mini∣sters of both Confessions, School-Masters, Readers, Students, &c. to escape the Pu∣nishments which they had incurred for their Rebellion, should promise under their Hands to renounce all their Functions both publick and private, and pass the rest of their Lives peaceably and quietly, upon pain of Death if they disobey'd. Or 2ly, That they should be banish'd for ever, with promise never to return to their Country, or to any of the Heredi∣tary Lands, or other dependencies on the Empire, nor yet to go over to their Enemies. Or 3ly, "That they should change their Religion, which his Majesty chiefly wish'd and design'd, and which would be most agreeable both to him and to the Courts of Justice. The 25th of September 1673. Some Mi∣nisters to the number of 32 or 33 appear'd, and being threatned to be sentenc'd to die, if they sign'd not the foregoing Articles; some consented, others chose to be banish'd, and one chang'd his Religion. This lucky beginning encourag'd them to proceed, and finding fear to be the strongest motive to work upon them; they cited all the Mini∣sters, Regents, School-Masters, &c. of Hun∣gary to appear before them, which caused a strange consternation amongst them, and produced very different effects; some of them the Nobility would not suffer to ap∣pear, others fled, some again abandoned themselves to the care of Providence, made their appearance at Poson, to justifie their Innocence from these horrible Calum∣nies, with which they were blackn'd, to testifie their obedience and submission to the Magistrate, and to satisfie their Churches, who earnestly begg'd of them not to forsake them in that calamitous Condition. There were 250 Ministers that appear'd, and by their Tryals (two long to repeat) it appears, That their Religion was the chief Crime, and tho' other things were laid to their Charge; yet all was but pretence; they used all means to intimidate them, and to shake that great constancy which they shew'd for their Religion; they sentenced them to death, imprisoned them, threatned them with the Gallies, and employ'd all the pernicious arts of torment and vexation, that a persecuting spirit could contrive, to shake or surprize the Frailty of Man; drag∣ged them into their Churches, forced them upon their Knees to adore the Host and their Images, let loose the fury of the Sol∣diery upon them, and encouraged them to torment them; in the midst of this barbar∣ous usage, they would sometimes pretend to shew a glimpse of Pity, and endeavour to allure them by the promises of the Im∣perial favour and protection, offering them preferments, upon Condition they would change their Religion; at length finding them proof against all their arts, they stig∣matiz'd several and sold them to the Spa∣nish Gallies, from whence afterwards they were redeem'd by the famous Ruyter, Admi∣ral of Holland; others were thrown into vile, loathsome Prisons in which some perish'd, the rest who out-lived their misfortunes, were released by the importunities of the States Ambassador at the Imperial Court. These matters of fact are too publick to be denied, and the Reasons that are given, seem by no means sufficient to palliate such Barbarities. Those Letters in Cypher which were produc'd against them, to prove them Guilty of Treason are justly suspe∣cted; but grant them true, they were but from particulars, and one or two Mens Guilt cannot render a whole body of Men liable to punishment. As for those Accu∣sations which were laid upon them of be∣ing Murderers, Robbers, Ravishers, &c. they were only alledged, not proved, and consequently likely to be meer Calumnies. To conclude, that they were Rebels because some fled from the Persecutions they saw
pouring upon them, seems to be no very good consequence, and to shew not so much their guilt as their fear; at least, this can∣not be urg'd against those that made their appearance; and that there were several which signed the Paper that was presented them, argued, they indeed weak but not criminal; and the rigours that were used to bring them to sign it, do extreamly di∣minish, if not absolutely take away all the force of that Argument: So that I doubt not, but it will appear to the impartial Rea∣der, that the conduct of the Popish Clergy has had too great an influence on these last Troubles, and that their persecuting Max∣ims, are as ruinous to the interest of a State, as contrary to the Spirit of our Chri∣stian Religion. And from this Original began that War, which hath ever since continued with great effusion of Blood, and strange vicissitudes of Fortune; which not only reduced Hungary to the pit of despair, but even Germany it self to the brink of Destruction; until God was pleas'd to take the Cause into his own Hands, and avenge Christendom from their Enemies, whose Sins (it seems) were more ripe for the Divine vengeance, than those of the Christian people. The discontents on both sides grew so high, that the Empe∣ror resolved to perform nothing on his part, of what he had promised to his Hungarian Subjects, nor they any thing on theirs, which respected Duty and Allegiance to their Prince. Both Parties stood in defiance to each other; the Emperor would not lose the benefit of the charge and expences he had been at, to fortify the frontier Gar∣risons against the Turks: Nor would the Hungarians restrain themselves from their usual Incursions, notwithstanding the Trea∣ty so lately sign'd by them: By which the Emperor received frequent complaints from the Turks. So all was now private Machinati∣ons and open Defiances. It was now in the Month of September, That the three years were expir'd, at the end whereof according to the Statutes of that Kingdom a Diet was to be Assembled at Presburg, for redress of those aggrievances of which the Subjects complain'd. It was usual for the Emperor to be present there, but some jealousies being whisper'd of a Plot to seize his Person, his Majesty refrain'd from making his appearance at that Diet; which being by that means put off, the Sovereign Chamber of the Kingdom,The Hun∣garians complain. taking all matters into their Consideration, sent their Deputies to complain unto the Em∣peror, That Colonel Spaar Governour of Zatmar, had extorted Money from the Citizens, upon pretence of paying his Sol∣diers, tho' in reality to appropriate it to his own benefit and service. That the Ger∣man Soldiers were still quarter'd in the Coun∣tries, notwithstanding all the Promises and Engagements given to the contrary; the which aggrievances together with that of taking away their Churches, was such a Scandal and block of Offence, as caused great Commotions in that Kingdom, when∣soever that matter came into dispute. Hence it was, That the Protestants chose three Leaders, or Chiefs of their Faction and Party; against which Prince Ragotski, and Apafi opposed their Forces in favour of the Palatine Wesselini;  and Count Palaffi Imbre appear'd as one of the Chief of the Male-contents; but having not sufficient Force to sustain his party and interest, he crav'd assistance and succour from the Turks, to whom he offer'd his Son for a Hostage, and the Town of Debin, with the dependences thereunto belonging, as a farther security for performance of Articles. All was now divided into Sects and Par∣ties: Count Peter Serini, of whom the Em∣peror had not the least jealousie, entertain∣ed secret consults with the Malecontents; and with Nadasti raised Forces upon pre∣tence of giving a stop to the Turks, in their passage to Dalmatia; but with real design to seize the Person of the Emperor at Put∣tendorf, a place appertaining to Count Na∣dasti; as he was Riding post with Prince Lubkovitz, Chief Steward of his House, and with about 12 Gentlemen of his Reti∣nue to meet the Empress; but that Plot took not effect, for their Ambuscade mis∣sing the Emperor, he happily met the Em∣press on her Journey out of Spain. This Conspiracy being thus disappointed,1667 Count Nadasti desired the Emperor, that he might be made Palatine of Hungary, in the place of Wesselini lately deceased: But the Emperor not being well satisfy'd of the Faith and Integrity of that Person, refused to con∣fer it upon him or any other, until he saw the Tranquillity and Peace of that Kingdom better secur'd; At which Nadasti being en∣rag'd, corrupted a Carpenter in revenge to set fire to the new Appartment, which was building in the Palace for the Empress Ele∣onora: In expectation that in such an affright∣ment and confusion, the Conspirators might seize on the Person of the Emperor: But God conserved his Imperial Majesty, tho' that Plot was not detected until Nadasti re∣ceived the reward of his demerit. The Deputies of the upper Hungary made new Addresses to the Emperor,  to have the Office of Palatine supplied according to the Constitutions of the Kingdom; but in those times of Sedition and Discontent, his Im∣perial Majesty not finding a Person equally grateful to the Hungarians, and loyal to
himself, to whom he could confide that Important Charge; did for some time keep the Office in his own hands; which with the refusal made to restore the Prote∣stant Churches, was so generally displeasing, that the Nobility deny'd to be present at the Coronation of the Empress, until they were a little mollify'd and appeas'd, by ha∣ving the Revenue and Rents of their Churches releas'd to them. Besides the Office of Palatine, the Go∣vernment of Carelstadt became vacant by the decease of the Count Aversperg, which being in Croatia, and lying commodious for Serini, he immediately made applicati∣ons for it, by means of his Lady; who with her good air and address, and the vi∣vacity of her Spirit, and fluency of her Language, thought nothing difficult for her to obtain; but missing thereof, for Reasons best known to the Emperor, who judg'd it not good policy to add greater Authority to a person who was Vice-King of Croatia, and possess'd already more Power and Inte∣rest than he could willingly afford him, the Lady was forc'd,Count Se∣rini's Lady disgusted. much against her Nature, to acquiess in a denial; but not being able to suppress the violent commotions of her Spirit, she openly breath'd out her menaces against the Emperor; and finding an humor in the People generally inclin'd to a Revolt, easily perswaded her Son-in-Law Prince Ragotski, and the other principal Nobles of Hungary to enter into an Association and Conspiracy against the Emperor. The Depu∣ties make their Com∣plaints to the Empe∣ror.The first thing they did, was to complain of the German Garrison in Tokai; and being assembled at Zemblin, they sent their De∣puties to represent unto the Emperor, that according to the Laws and Privileges of that Kingdom, all their Forts and Places of Strength ought to be Garrison'd with no other than Soldiers of their own Country. That the Protestants receiv'd all sorts of ill treatment and discountenance, their Church∣es were taken away, and not restor'd, as was promis'd and agreed; besides several other Aggrievances which they laid before the Emperor, supplicating his Imperial Ma∣jesty to grant them ease and redress there∣in, according to the Constitutions and Pri∣vileges of that Kingdom, which his Ma∣jesty at his Coronation had Sworn to main∣tain. To all which, the gentle and sweet tem∣per of his Imperial Majesty, and the sense of his Conscience was inclin'd to yield a be∣nign and gracious Answer, had not Father Emeric a Jesuit,Emeric a Jesuit hin∣ders an agreement with the Hunga∣rians. and his Confessor, instill'd other Principles and Motives into his Mind; giving him to understand, that it had al∣ways been the Prerogative of the Kings his Predecessors, to dispose Garrisons in all places of that Kingdom, consisting of such Nations as he should judge most for the safety and security thereof. And that whereas at present the Hungarians were in∣spir'd with an humor of Rebellion and Re∣volt, there was no reason to trust or con∣fide in them, but in the Germans only, whose Loyalty and Duty was sufficiently known, and approv'd by his Majesty. Farther he added, that the Hungarians had in the late War against the Turk suf∣fer'd Waradin to be lost; and at the Battle of St. Gothards upon the River of Raab, had appear'd in such small numbers for de∣fence of their Country, as if they had in∣tended to have betray'd it; had it not been for the German and other Foreign Forces, the whole Kingdom had become a Prey to the Turks. With such Discourses as these the Depu∣ties were entertain'd,The Depu∣ties return with dissa∣tisfaction. The Evils thereof. and dispatch'd away without other satisfaction; at which the Nobles and People were so displeas'd, that they gave a stop to the Payments they had begun to make towards building the Forts, and cut all the Germans in pieces which they found quarter'd about the Country; and particularly they kill'd forty Soldiers of the Regiment of Spaar near Xants; the which piece of Blood and Slaughter was again return'd by the Germans, and Force repell'd again by Force. So that now all was open defiance, War, and Massacre. To carry on the Great Designs in hand,The Male-contents as∣semble at Kivar. the Malecontents assembled at the Castle of Kivar, upon the Frontiers of Transilva∣nia, about two Leagues distant from Ghi∣bania, where the Gold and Silver Mines arise. The Principal Persons there present, were Ladislas Giulaf, Gabriel de Kende, Be∣nedict Seredey, Jonas Veradt, the Calvinist Minister of Cassovia; also Derus Bansi Ge∣neral of the Transilvanian Forces; Janos Betlem the Chancellor, Michael Talha Go∣vernor of the Frontiers, with some others; where a League was form'd between the Hungarian and Transilvanian Protestants, to drive and expell the Germans out of the Kingdom, to demolish Zatmar, and to arm themselves in defence of their Religion. In this accord the Wife of Prince Apafi ap∣pear'd extreamly zealous, being a Woman of a Masculine Spirit, a fierce Protestant, and one who had a hand in all Matters, whilst her Husband apply'd himself to Hunting, and to the Conversation of Learned Men. In the mean time Count Nadasti having fail'd in his late Treason against the Em∣peror,Count Na∣dasti Plots how to Poison the Emperor. contriv'd to Poyson him at a Mag∣nificent Banquet, which he had prepar'd for him; at which the Persons present, were the Empress, the two Imperial Princesses, Prince Charles of Lorain, with all the Court. The fatal Dish prepar'd for the Emperor
was a Pidgeon Pye, which he extreamly lov'd; but God preserv'd his Sacred Per∣son, by means of the Lady to the Count; who being endow'd with greater Senti∣ments of Honour and Religion than her Husband, beseech'd him on her knees to desist from so black and so detestable a Wickedness; but not being able to prevail upon him, she Order'd the Cook to set another Pye of the same fashion before the Emperor, in the place of that which was poyson'd; of which he having eaten with∣out any hurt, Nadasti apprehended the dealing of his Wife therein; and least the Cook should discover the Secret, he kill'd him the same day with his own hand. Count Serini, tho' he was contriving all this time, yet it was not in Matters of so black a nature as these. He entertain'd several Conferences with Count Tassembach, a Person of as Ambitious and unsetled an humor as any whatsoever,  and ready to enter into any League and Conspiracy with the other Malecontents. And in fine, after many Consultations, he concluded it ne∣cessary to engage the Turks with them in the whole Enterprize.A Treaty held with the Turk. But lest it should come to be discover'd to the Emperor's Re∣sident at Constantinople, by the openness of the Turks, who can keep no Secret, it was resolv'd that the Matter should be Ne∣gotiated by the Transilvanians; who being already Subject to the Turks, and under their protection, might with less suspicion propose this Treaty. The Turks hearken to the Hunga∣rians.This Overture being made to the Turks, they immediately embrac'd it, being an Offer which at the first sight appear'd very advantageous; but then the next Condition requir'd by the Chimacam, who was Kara Mustapha, (the Grand Vizier being then at the Siege of Candia) was, That in Conside∣ration of the aid and protection which the Grand Seignior was to give unto the Hun∣garians, they were to become his Tributa∣ries, in the same manner, and on the same Conditions as the Transilvanians were. This Demand, tho it seem'd hard to the Hunga∣rians, yet they resolv'd to pursue their De∣sign; and accordingly sent their Agents to the Vizier at Candia, hoping by the lenity and moderation of his Nature to obtain more easie terms than those demanded by the Chimacam; and in the mean time to notifie their intention of Revolt unto all the World, they caus'd a Standard to be erected, with two Symeters died with Blood, and a Crescent or Half Moon over them. The Grand Vizier at Candia dismisses the Agents from the Rebels. The Grand Vizier being then labouring at the Siege of Candia, and in a doubtful Condition of Success, was not willing to entertain thoughts of a new War, until he had put an end to that which he had then in hand, and in which he was daily engag'd. Howsoever, not to seem diffident of his own Successes, or negligent and cold in the entertainment of Propositions so apparently advantageous to his Master's Interest, thought not fit to dismiss them with a slight Answer; but causing their Propositions to be taken in Writing, and examin'd, he dis∣speeded the Messengers with fair Words and Promises, referring their Matters to be far∣ther debated by the Officers actually pre∣sent with the Grand Seignior, who had more time to consider their Affairs than he had, who was daily engag'd in Batteries, and continual Assaults upon the City. The Transilvanian Messengers being come to the Port,Conditions demanded of them by the Turks. the Conditions requir'd of them by the Turks were very severe. For in the first place, they demanded of Ra∣gotski, who was Chief of the League, that the five Towns in Hungary which belong'd to him should be deliver'd up into their hands; That Count Serini should cause Copranitz, an impregnable Fort in Croatia to be surrender'd to them; and that an An∣nual Tribute should be pay'd for the King∣dom of Hungary. The Commissioners for the Malecontents, who thought these Proposals very hard, did yet endeavour to come as near an ac∣cord as was possible; for tho they were un∣willing to surrender up their own Towns and Demesnes to the Turks, yet they pro∣mis'd to fight for them, and deliver such Towns and Fortresses as they should take from the Emperor into their hands. The Grand Vizier Kuperlee was by this time return'd Triumphant from Candia,  ha∣ving with the entire subjection of that City, and the whole Kingdom, put an end to the War with the Venetians. Howsoever tho' the Propositions offer'd by the Malecontents were of such advantageous Consequence as the like could not be expected, yet they were rejected by the Vizier; for whether it were out of a sense of Faith to the Em∣peror,Kuperlee unwilling to break with the Emperor. with whom he had concluded a Peace but five years before, and which he had no cause given him to break, or by reason of a War design'd against Poland; and some umbrages and Clouds of discontent, began with the Moscovites; he was not of a mind to enter into a War so soon with the Emperor; howsoever he under-hand en∣courag'd it, and gave private Instructions to the Pasha's on the Frontiers to aid the Male∣contents in such sort, as that their union and actings with them might not amount unto a Rupture, or breach of the Peace. During all this time the Imperial Court had only suspicions and jealousies of what was Plotting, rather than any certain ad∣vice
or knowledge thereof. And the Em∣perour's Resident at Constanstinople had as yet received but some obscure Notions, of what was treating by the Transilvanian Agents, which afterwards came to a clearer Light, by the means of an English Gentle∣man as we have before declar'd in our pre∣ceding History: And which being once made known, other things appear'd to put the matter out of all doubt or question. And as a particular Evidence to discover this Truth; the principal Servant of Count Tassembach, and one in whom he had repo∣sed the greatest confidence, having been put in Prison by him for Robbing him; this Traitor that he might be revenged on the Count and obtain his Liberty, discovered much of the Plot, by producing one of the original Papers, all written with the proper Hand of Tassembach, which contain'd a Scheme of the whole method of their in∣tended proceedings, as agreed and concer∣ted between him and Count Serini, dated the 11th of September 1667. This Paper be∣ing Read in the Council at Vienna, served to open the Eyes of the Emperor, and of the Government, and caused them to watch all the motions of Tassembach, and of Serini and the other Accomplices. To evidence and farther confirm that there was a Plot, advices came from Scha∣ketorno in Croatia, that Count Serini was in Arms and had levied several Troops.A Plot dis∣covered. The original Letter also appeared which Serini wrote to Frangipani, giving him an account of the Resolutions and Proceedings of Tas∣sembach; the which Letter (by what means is not known) was found with a Soldier belonging to Frangipani, who carelesly made use of it, for a stopper to his Powder-horn: Another Letter was intercepted from Fran∣gipani, directed to one of his Captains in whom he reposed his greatest confidence: Signifying the offers which he had made to the Turks of subjection to them; that the Ger∣mans intended nothing more than to ruin their Country; and therefore, that he should keep his Forces in a readiness to oppose them in case of necessity. These and several other Evidences were a clear conviction of a Plot design'd; and a ground sufficient for the President of the Council of Grats, to seize the Person of Count Tassembach, and commit him to safe Custody. After which his House was search∣ed, where was found a considerable quanti∣ty of Powder and Ammunition: And his Papers being also seized and examined, it thereby appeared, that the Arms and Ammu∣nition were designed to furnish therewith 6000 Men, which he intended to raise: and upon farther enquiry into this matter, several questions being put to him; Tassem∣bach own'd the whole Design and Conspira∣cy, and the Engagements which were be∣tween him and the Count Serini. Whereof Copies with the Process being sent to the Emperor, the whole Plot was discover'd, and no further doubt or question made of a Rebellion, and General revolt of the whole Kingdom. This discovery was seconded by advices of the constant intercourse and correspon∣dences held between Serini, and the Pasha's of Buda, Bosna and Kanisia: And more particularly by a Letter, which Marquis Frangipani Brother-in-Law to Count Serini wrote to Captain Tscolnits, containing the whole secret of the business, and served to demonstrate the inveterane Malice, which the Marquis had conceived against the Em∣peror, and the whole German Nation. Tscol∣nits, had at first entertained a correspon∣dence with the Malecontents, but making re∣flections afterwards on the persons, with whom he was to engage; that they were rash and heady, and Men of no solid Foun∣dation or good Temper, he retracted from his former Engagements, and show'd the Letter to the Emperor. But matters were proceeded too far, to be wholly suppressed or defeated: For those in the upper Hungary appeared openly in the Field under Ragotski, who threatned to take Mongatz, where his Mother held her Court of Residence, and to seize on the Trea∣sure,  which his Father had amassed during the time, that he was Prince of Transilvania. The time being come in which the Male-contents had appointed to draw their Forces into the Field, on pretence of enterprising something against the Turks: For we must note, that in times of Peace, it is allow∣able for both sides either Turks, or Chri∣stians to make Incursions upon each other, to Rob and drive away Cattle, and to fight in the Field with strong Parties both of Horse and Foot, provided that the numbers of them do not exceed 5000, and that no Cannon be brought into the Camp. Such is the miserable Condition of that unfortunate Kingdom: The Malecontents, I say, having with this pretence drawn their Forces into the Field; convened a Diet at Cassovia,A Diet at Cassovia. with∣out out the knowledge or authority of the Em∣peror; where the Nobility and the Deputies of the several Towns, and Cities in the lower Hungary were Assembled; to the end, that they might have an understanding toge∣ther, how to raise Money, and how to manage the War. The Emperor, tho' not ignorant of all these Motions and Consults; yet wanting a sufficient force to suppress these first begin∣nings of Rebellion, thought fit to tempo∣rize and use Lenity for a while; tho' in the
mean time he declared against the illegality of the Diet; which the Malecontents excu∣sed,The Empe∣ror declares against it. and disguised under the colour of an Assembly, in which nothing more was in∣tended, than only to raise 8000 Foot and 4000 Horse, to oppose the continual De∣predations and Incursions of the Turk. But the Emperor saw farther into the manner of their actings, than to believe their words; for Princes have just cause to suspect the Loyalty of their Subjects,  who take up Arms without the Privity and Consent of their Sovereigns: And therefore to try, and prove the Sincerity of their intentions, the Emperor cited the Chief of the Malecon∣tents to appear at Newsol,The Chiefs are cited to Newsol. there to render an account of their Actings to his Commissi∣oners appointed to examine those matters, namely the Count of Forcatz, the Arch-Bishop of Strigonium, Zitzchi, who was President of the Royal Chamber, and Na∣dasti, who had not as yet declared himself of the contrary party, which he under-hand encouraged and countenanced. The Ma∣lecontents yielded no obedience to this Cita∣tion, and refused to make their appearance; and instead thereof 13 Counties entred in∣to an Association, and raised Soldiers, which were commanded by Ragotski, who there∣unto joyn'd 2000 Men of his own, whom he leavied and maintain'd at his own ex∣pence. Count Sta∣remberg Imprison∣ed.Ragotski, who thought it now time to cast off his Disguise, invited Count Starem∣berg to Dinner, and in the mean time in∣vested the City of Tokai, of which he was the Governour, with 8000 Hussars; but the place was so well defended by the watch∣fulness and valour of the Lieutenant Govern∣our, that his Men were repulsed with a considerable loss. Nor was he more pro∣sperous in his attempt upon Mongatz, which, at the news of his approach, was defended by his Mother, who caused the Bridges to be drawn and the Cannon levelled against him, preferring the Loyalty towards her Prince before the natural tenderness to a Son, to whom she sent those Reproaches of his Treachery, as became a Lady of that great and generous Vertue. In the mean time the Malecontents in de∣spight of the Emperor held their Meeting,  which they called a Diet at Cassovia;The Male∣contents of∣fer their aggrievan∣ces to the Emperor. and having concerted all their matters, and a∣greed on a Scheme of their Affairs, they drew up a Remonstrance of their chief Aggrievances, which they offered to his Im∣perial Majesty, desiring that the Churches taken from the Protestants might again be restor'd to them: That all their Towns and Fortresses might be freed and eased of German Soldiers, and that in place of them, their Garrisons might be supplied with Hun∣garians: And Lastly, That they might have liberty to make War on the Turks, with their own Men, and at their own expence. These Propositions were rejected by the Emperor at the instigation of his Chief Officers and Ministers of State, who swallowing in their desires all the Riches and Possessions of the Hungarians, hoped to force them into a Rebellion, by which their Lands and Estates might be forfeited to the Emperor, that they might beg them for their own benefit and enjoyment. The Emperor communicated all these matters to the Diet at Ratisbon, giving them to understand how necessary it was to sup∣press these Disturbances and Insurrections in their beginnings: And immediately before he sent his Forces into the upper Hungary, he thought fit to cause Major General Span∣kau to March into Croatia against Serini with 6000 Men. Upon the news of the approach of these Forces,Sereni un∣resolved. Serini was greatly surprized, and in such a consternation that he knew not what to resolve. He was dis∣appointed of Money to pay his Army, with which Ragotski had promised to supply him out of his Father's Treasury at Mongatz, but that failed as we have show'd before. The Valachians had likewise deserted him, and adhered to Count Herberstein Govern∣our of Carolstadt. Nor was the time as yet come, that the Malecontents had appointed to stir in the upper Hungary; in the mean time his own Forces were weak and incon∣siderable, not exceeding 2000 Morlaques in his City of Chiacatorno, and those ill pro∣vided either with Money, Ammunition or Vi∣ctuals to maintain a Seige. What then was to be done? Why, nothing but submission to the Will and Clemency of the Emperor; which being resolved, Father Forstal an Au∣gustin Friar, and an intimate Friend of Serini, was employ'd to Vienna to manage this Accommodation: Where being arrived,He submits to the Em∣peror. he ap∣ply'd himself to Prince Lubkovitz, the Em∣peror's principal Minister of State, to whom having imparted his Message; it was recei∣ved by him with much kindness and joy; and was the more acceptable, because Serini was his Kinsman, and nearly ally'd to him: And therefore frankly told him, That two things were expected from Serini. First, That he should send his Son for a Hostage to Vienna: And Secondly, That he should subscribe a blank Paper, signifying, that he would accept of such Conditions as the Em∣peror should be pleased to impose upon him: Both which being performed, (as is here proposed) Prince Lubkovitz did pro∣mise in behalf of the Emperor,  that Serini should not only receive a General Pardon, but should also conserve his Liberty, Places and Offices of Trust, Dignities and Privileges;
only in case the Emperor should think fit to remove him from the Office of Vice-King of Croatia,Offers made by Prince Lubkovitz to Serini. he promised that in lieu thereof he should have the Government of Carolstadt conferr'd upon him, or some other of equal importance. And farther, this Prince, to demonstrate his concernment and respect to this Family (of which he was a Member) offer'd out of his own Estate to pay the Debts thereof, which amounted to 400000 Florins, and for ever to espouse the interest of Serini, and of those related to him. Father Forstal returning with this Dispatch, received at the Hands of Count Serini, his only Son to be carried for an Hostage to the Emperor, with a blank Pa∣per signed, promising to receive German Soldiers into all his Garrisons. But before Forstal could finish his second Journey to Vienna, Spankau arrived with the Imperial Army before Chiacatorno. And tho' Serini sent him forth a Message, ac∣quainting him of his Accommodation with the Emperor, and his Treaty now in hand negotiated by Forstal; yet General Spankau, having received no such advices or directi∣ons from the Emperor, pursued the Tenure of his first Commission, and accordingly be∣sieged Chiacatorno, and so streightly pressed it, that Serini and his Brother-in-Law, the Marquis Frangipani, were forced to escape and abandon the City, and leave it with all that was dear and precious to them for a Prey to their Enemies.  And so issuing forth by a secret Sally Port, with about 30 other Persons of quality,Serini e∣s apes out of Chiaca∣torno. with intention to submit, and lay themselves at the Feet of his Imperial Majesty, they unfortunately committed themselves to the guidance and direction of Count Keri, who pretending great Friendship to them, received them in∣to his Castle with 5 or 6 Servants, preten∣ding that he could not receive, or entertain a greater number for want of Furniture, or Conveniences fit for their better Accommo∣dation. So soon as these two Lords with their Servants were within the Walls of the Castle, Keri caused the Bridge to be drawn up, and his Soldiers to stand to their Arms, and placed Guards in all parts and avenues of the Castle. The two Counts tho' very sen∣sible of the Treachery of Keri; yet dissem∣bled their resentments thereof, and suffer'd themselves to be carried Prisoners without any resistance to Vienna;Are made Prisoners. where they were at first Lodged in the Suburbs, in the Convent of Augustin Friars, from whence they were carried to the Swan Inn, where they stay'd until towards night, and then were separated, and carried to divers places; Serini was conducted to the House of Baron Ugart, Lieutenant Colonel of the Regiment then in Garrison at Vienna; and Frangipani to the House of Count Daun Major of the Town, where they were both so civilly treated, that they were not sensible of being under any restraint; being visited by all the Persons of Note and Quality in Town; but by degrees the crouds of Visitants became thin, and addresses faint and cold, which were sure Indications of some thing evil in∣tended against them. For tho' his Imperial Majesty, out of his natural Clemency, was graciously disposed to have pardoned them; yet having his Spirit exasperated by such as had a mind to enter into their confiscated Estates, Process was made against them, and things carried on to the highest Seve∣rity. In the mean time Count Herberstein Go∣vernour of Carolstadt, seized on all the places belonging to Serini and Frangipani without much difficulty or opposition; only at Coade, the Governour refused to surrender upon Summons, but instead thereof dis∣play'd two Bloody Flags on the top of a high Steeple; and return d answer, That he would be buried in that place before he would tamely yield it up, and betray the charge committed to him; which accordingly follow∣ed the same Evening, for by that time Her∣berstein had by Force of Arms made his Entry into the Town and Castle, where ta∣king the Governour and seven other Offi∣cers, he hanged them up wrapped in the same Red Flaggs, which they had so lately display'd. Thus were the measures of the Malecon∣tents broke for some time,Preparati∣ons for a War made by the Em∣peror. and the whole Party discourag'd. The Emperor on the other side prepares for War, and raises a considerable Army. The Duke of Branden∣burg offers himself to serve in Person against the Rebels; the Duke of Saxony had al∣ready Commanded 600 Horse, 400 Dra∣goons, and a thousand Foot to march for the Service of the Emperor, under the Com∣mand of the Great Marshal Christian Ernest, a Captain in those days of great Reputation. The Count de Vaudemont offer'd moreover to contribute to his assistance with several Troops of Lorrainers; but his Imperial Ma∣jesty being provided with a sufficient force of his own Subjects, civilly refused their offers, intending to reserve the same for times of extream and more pressing difficul∣ties; for 'tis the policy of Wise and Cau∣tious Princes never to admit Stranger For∣ces into their Dominions, without a violent necessity; to which the Emperor was not reduc'd, because as yet the Turks had not joyn'd their Forces with the Armies of the Malecontents. Howsoever both sides were in motion, and big with Design one against the other. Ragotski was preparing to Be∣siege Tokai and Zatmar, and the Imperia∣lists
were making a Bridge of Boats near Presburg, to open a passage into the upper Hungary. Count Sporke in the mean time with some Troops of Horse defeated a Party of 2000 Hungarians, killing 300 on the Place, and taking ten Colours, with the loss only of nine Men. Ragotski also receiv'd a Repulse before Tokai and Zatmar, which tho' blockt up by him for some time, yet having receiv'd late Recruits both of Men and Provisions, they refus'd to surrender at his Summons, which put him out of all hopes of prevailing against those Places. And with these, and the like Successes, the Spirits of the Male∣contents becoming more low and debased,Ragotski labours to make his Peace with the Empe∣ror. Ragotski the Chief of the Association en∣tertain'd thoughts of submitting to the Empe∣ror; and to make his way more easie thereun∣to, he freely set Count Statemberg at Li∣berty, with the other Officers whom he had detained Prisoners, desiring them to interceed with his Imperial Majesty for his Pardon. And farther, to evidence a true Repentance for his late defection, and real intentions to return to his due obedience, he rais'd the Siege from before Tokai, and caus'd his Forces to march into Transilva∣nia; and particularly he employ'd Count Colonitz, who had been his Prisoner, with others, to Negotiate in his behalf at the Court of the Emperor. But this Count not being able to obtain other than ambiguous and general Answers from the Emperors Council, it was not thought safe for Ragot∣ski to rely on those terms and methods which had before fail'd in the Cases of Se∣rini and Frangipani. And therefore the Princess his Mother, to play a surer Game, and to take off all jealousie, engaged, in the name of her Son, that he should receive into all places of his jurisdiction such Gar∣risons as the Emperor should please to im∣pose upon him, and maintain them at his own Charge. Thus did the Troubles of Hungary seem to incline towards a Composure, caus'd in∣deed by the evil directions of the Empe∣ror's Council, who to introduce an Arbi∣trary Power into a Free Kingdom, and to make that Crown Hereditary which was Originally Elective, and to force a Reli∣gion on them contrary to their Principles, and Consciences, had taken away their Churches and places where they assembled to serve God, and compell'd them to re∣ceive German and Foreign Garrisons into all places and Fortresses of strength within that Kingdom.  So that if any thing may be said in defence and excuse for a People who rebel against their Prince, certainly the Hungarians had all those Arguments which might be deduced from the Topicks of Law, Natural Liberty, and Self-preserva∣tion to plead for them. But notwithstanding this submission of Ragotski to the Emperor, by which the Troubles seem'd in some measure to abate, and the Malecontents to lay their Arms and Pretensions down, yet still the Animosities were high, and the minds of those who were Loyal and well-affected to the Empe∣ror, griev'd and afflicted to see their poor Country over-run and harass'd with Ger∣man and Foreign Souldiers;The Loyal Hungari∣ans Peti∣tion the Emperor. wherefore in a sense thereof, they sent their Deputies to the Emperor, representing their Fidelity and constant Allegiance to his Majesty, from which they had never suffer'd themselves to be seduc'd; and therefore they humbly pray'd that they might not be number'd with the guilty, nor their Towns and Lands made a prey to the Liberty and Licenti∣ousness of Soldiers. In case any of their Country-Men had offended, they ought to be legally Cited before the Tribunals of Justice; but to make his Loyal Subjects equally noxious with the Disobedient, was a Severity unagreeable to the known Cle∣mency of his Imperial Majesty. But all the moving Language which the Deputies could use in behalf of their Principals a∣vail'd little; for General Sporke being re∣cruited with a considerable Army which Ge∣neral Heister had brought out of Bohemia, was Commanded with all expedition to march into Hungary; the appearance of which not only troubled the Hungarians,The Turks alarm'd at the coming of German Forces on the Fron∣tiers. but alarm'd the Turks, who assembling in great numbers about the Quarters of Ka∣nisia, dispatch'd several Messengers one after the other to Vienna, to know and to be satisfy'd of the Reasons and Causes which mov'd the Emperor in a time of Peace, to send so considerable an Army to lodge and encamp on the Frontiers of the Grand Seignior's Country. In like man∣ner the Pasha's of Newhawsel and Agria be∣ing alarm'd with the near approach of this Christian Army, prepar'd for a Defence; and withal sent a Chiaus to General Sporke to assure him, that the Grand Seignior had resolved not to assist or afford Aid unto the Malecontents, nor to enter on the Emperor's Lands, or to do any thing to the infring∣ment, or violation of the Truce some few years before concluded: And on the other side, the Chiaus told General Sporke, that the Grand Seignior did conjure him to let him know the Causes, and design which moved the Emperor to appear with a Force so consider∣able, and in the times of Peace so unusual on the Frontiers. To which the General returned answer,General Sporke's Answer to the Turks. That the Emperor his Ma∣ster had no design, or intention to pass the Limits of his Dominions, or to act any
thing towards a Rupture, or to the Infringe∣ment of the Peace between him and the Grand Seignior; and that the Commission he had received from the Emperor, was only to suppress the Rebellion of his own Sub∣jects, who had taken up Arms against him: And thus much he supposed to be lawful, without any concernment of the Grand Seignior therein. With these assurances the Chiaus departed, and Suspicions and Jealou∣sies seem'd to clear up on the side of the Turks. And herewith did the Clouds in all quarters seem to disperse for a while:Ragotski Karoned. For Ragotski, who was chief of the League be∣ing brought into favour by the intercession of his Mother, and all things accommoda∣ted by a Treaty which he held with the Prince of Holstein and General Heister, a Passport or Writing of Safe Conduct was sent him by the Emperor, and all the Of∣fences and Crimes which were past, were pardoned and forgiven to him. And Ragot∣ski on the other side, that he might make a Return agreeable to so much Goodness and Clemency of the Emperor, published his Edicts in all parts of his own Dominions, forbidding his Subjects to Rise in Arms, or to favour the Cause of the Malecontents, ei∣ther directly or indirectly, upon pain of losing their Noses or Ears, or being more severely proceeded against, by Punishment of Death. Ragotski had thus wisely made his peace with his Sword in his Hand; whil'st poor Serini, and Frangipani had partly by their own Fears, ill Conduct and Treachery of others, fallen into the power of their Ene∣mies: With whom at first they received a kind Treatment, and hopes of being set at Liberty with restitution to their Estates, Dignities and Privileges: But afterwards, time discovering many private Practices, which at first were unknown and lay con∣cealed, the Chief Ministers of State, for the Reasons before mentioned, and to make some Examples of the Emperor's Indigna∣tion for the late Revolt, perswaded his Caesarean Majesty to proceed against them by Impeachment of High Treason; which when Serini perceived, he wrote an Expo∣stulatory Letter to the Emperor to this pur∣pose. Serini ju∣stifies him∣self.That tho' the Hungarians had much to say for themselves in regard to their Laws, and their Country, which Nature and Religion obliged them to defend: And tho' the Provocation was high, when the House of Austria labour'd to make that Kingdom Hereditary, which was originally Elective; and to subvert the Laws and Liberties of the People, who were by their Constitutions free as any Nation of the World, and to introduce upon them Tyranny and Op∣pression, with the loss of their Privileges and Religion; yet he would not justifie himself upon any of those Topicks, but rather insist on his Innocence, and Avow that he did never Enter into any League with the Turk, nor take up Arms against his Sovereign; against whom, neither by himself, or his Subjects he had com∣mitted any act of Hostility; but to the con∣trary had blindly obey d the Commands of his Imperial Majesty, the which appear'd by the Negotiation of Father Forstal in his behalf; by whom he sent his only Son for a Hostage, and with him a blank Paper, that the Em∣peror might inscribe therein what Articles and Conditions he judged fit; moreover, that he had enjoyned his Son-in-Law, Prince Ra∣gotski, to submit unto the Emperor, at a time when he was at the Head of an Army, and possessed the Narrow passes leading to the Mountains, and other advantageous places of great importance. He deny d all Intercourse and Correspondence with the Turks, unless it were with intention to betray them; and that when they tempted his Faith and Fidelity to the Emperor with large offers of reward, he discover d all to the Count of Rothal, to whom he Read the very Letters which were sent to him; and held no Treaty with any, but what he had made known to his Imperial Majesty. He highly insisted on the promises made him by the Baron Oker Lord Chancellour, who assured him that the Disgrace into which he was fallen, should serve to raise him to higher Dignities; and that Prince Lubkovitz had, in the presence of Baron Oker, promised him great rewards, in case he could take of Prince Ragotski, his Son-in-Law, from the disaffected Party: Which he had accordingly done, and so well succeeded therein, that immediately upon the Receipt of his Letter, Ragotski had set Count Staremberg at Liberty, and entirely submitted himself with all his Forces to the Will and Devotion of his Majesty: After all which and much more, that he could alledge in justification of himself, he might reasonably hope, that his Majesty, who was a Prince of unparallell d Clemency, would deal with him after the generous Example of Julius Caesar, who burnt the Letters of Pompey and Scipio without Reading, tho' thereby he might have discover'd the Names, and Plots of all the Con∣spirators against him: And tho' he could not hope for, or desire such an implicite manner of proceeding; yet he expected so much Justice, as to have his Cause try d before Wise and Im∣partial Judges. This Leter had much availed with the Emperor, had not Count Nadasti,Nadasi be∣trays Se∣rini. Brother-in-Law to Serini, insinuated to the Council, the Fictions and false Colours contained there∣in: To which discovery even Prince Ragotski his Son-in-Law much contributed, by re∣signing into the hands of the Emperor's Mi∣nisters, all those original Letters written to
him by his Father-in-Law, by which all the methods and measures of the Design were plainly laid open and exposed: And his E∣nemies supply'd with sufficient Crimes to lay unto his Charge, and to fill an Endict∣ment against him. Such is the falsity of this World, in which there is no Faith either a∣mongst Friends or Relations. In the mean time the General of the Imperial Army ad∣vanced his Forces against the Malecontents, who still stood out, and entertained thoughts of Retiring with their Families into the Do∣minions of the Turks: To prevent which he march'd with 15 Regiments against Padock, Mongatz and Erschet, places belonging to Ragotski: In the first of which the Princess Ragotski, going before, prepar'd a Magnifi∣cent Banket for General Sporke, to whom, after the Entertainment, she deliver'd the Keys of the place, and presented him with a Horse and Furniture rated at the value of about Eleven thousand Roman Crowns: And having here placed a Garrison, as also in Padock, Czalos, Serentz and Mongatz, Lieu∣tenant General Heister Marched to Erschet, where many and the most considerable of the Malecontents were retir'd, and refused to receive any Garrison, either from the Emperor or the Prince Ragotski,Erschet stands out. until first a Pardon or act of Oblivion were given them in due form and manner; and herein they so resolutely persisted, that they levelled their Cannon against the Imperial Forces, by which the Landtgrave of Hesse had his Horse killed under him; and would have maintain'd their Post to the last extremity, but that General Sporke being more wil∣ling to use Lenity than Rigour, sent to the Besieged a blank Paper, promising, on Con∣dition of Surrender, to yield unto all the Articles that they should write therein; which being accepted,Surrenders on Condi∣tions. and the Capitulations drawn, the Town was deliver'd. The City of Cas∣sovia following the Example of Erschet, open'd their Gates to the Imperialists,Cassovia yields. and promised to give Free quarters to the Sol∣diers, provided they might have and enjoy a free exercise of their Religion: This City of Cassovia, since the time it had acknow∣ledged the Austrian Family for their Sove∣reigns, had never been violated, or saw en∣trance forcibly made thereinto: For which Reason, the General was pleased to make a Triumphant Entry, and to pass with his Army through the midst of its Street with Trumpets, Hautboys, and all sorts of War∣like Musick; and having left a sufficient Garrison therein, he proceeded to take in other Towns and Countries, which for the most part submitted to the prevailing Power; tho' with much Regret and Displeasure to see themselves subjected by Foreign Forces, and by Garrisons stronger than the Inhabi∣tants; especially the County of Zemplin highly contended, and seemed resolved to oppose themselves against such masterless Guests,Zemplin refuses to take Ger∣man Gar∣risons. until General Sporke threatned to give them no Quarter, and in case of resi∣stance, to enter their Country with Fire and Sword. Bassory, and other Chiefs of the discon∣tented Party, being affrighted with these Menaces, desired Apafi, Prince of Transilva∣nia,The Male∣contents fly into Mol∣davia. to grant them Protection and Refuge within his Dominions: But he being for∣bidden by the Turks to receive their Persons, or own their Cause, absolutely refused to grant them quarters or safety within his Country: Upon which denial they fled into Moldavia and Valachia, where they dispersed and con∣cealed themselves, until a more proper time presented to assert their Liberty. Thus was all Hungary entirely subjected to the Command and Power of the Empe∣ror; excepting only Muran, which was the City and Seat of the late Palatine Wessel∣lini, and which was then guarded and de∣fended by his Widow; and was, as believed, the place where the Consultations were held, and where the Plots and Factions were car∣ried on.Muran yielded. To take in this place Prince Charles of Lorrain appear'd before it, with a consi∣derable party both of Horse and Foot, a∣gainst which the Countess being not able to make any long resistance, yielded the place upon honourable Conditions. Amongst other Malecontents which were there seized, Nagi∣ferents who had been the Chief Confident of the late Palatine Wessellini,Nagiserent seized. and Secretary of the League, was there secur'd with all his Pa∣pers, which made a discovery of the whole Plot, and of the Names of the principal Actors therein. These Papers were contain'd in five Chests, consisting of Letters, In∣structions, Treaties, Acts, &c. which be∣ing sent to Vienna and there examined, it plainly appear'd thereby, what part Count Nadasti was to perform, and how far he was engaged: It discover'd farther, all the pro∣ceedings both of Serini and Frangipani,Nadasti discovered to be in the Plot. and furnished their Enemies with Articles against them: And several Letters were intercepted, which made the Countess of Wessellini to be one of the Complices, and concerned in the Conspiracy. Nadasti had all this time dissembled his Party, and seemed zealous for the Emperor against the Malecontents, keeping himself quiet, and retired within his Castle of Puttendorf. But so soon as he un∣derstood, that the Secretary with his Papers was seized, his Conscience smote him, so that he provided for his Escape, intending with 500 Horse to make his way for Venice; but before he could prepare to be gone, his Castle was Invested by the Lieutenant Co∣lonel of the Regiment of Heister; and he
himself seized in his Bed and carried to Vi∣enna; where by order of the Emperor, he was lodg'd in the Common House belonging to the Nobility of Hungary, where after he had re∣main'd 3 days he acknowledged his Crimes, and humbly beg'd the mercy and pardon of the Emperor; but his Crimes were too black, and wrote in too large and plain Characters to deserve a remission.His Pardon deny'd. And besides, he was possess'd of vast Riches, having eight Millions of Livers in ready Money by him; which being a Prey that the Chief Mini∣sters of State might vouchsafe to stoop un∣to, they colour'd his Actions with a dye more black than those Accusations which were objected against Serini, or Frangipani. Whilst these things were in agitation, and the Indictments drawing up against these three great Personages,The Assem∣bly at Leusch require a mainte∣nance of their Pri∣vileges the Assembly of Hungarians met at Leusch, represented unto the Emperor, That it was their undoubted Right according to the Constitutions of that Kingdom (to the observation of which the Emperor had religiously Sworn) to be the Judges themselves of the Nobles, and others of their Country who were accused of Treason, or other Crimes; and there∣fore they desir'd that a speedy day might be fix'd for the Tryal of those three Counts, whose Cause was only to be heard before the Palatine and Deputies of that Kingdom. Moreover they presum'd to represent unto his Imperial Majesty, That it was one of the Fundamental Laws and Constitutions of their Country, to have the Office of Pa∣latine supply'd soon after the vacancy; which having now been void for a conside∣rable time, all those Acts which have pass'd since, ought to be esteem'd null, and of no effect. The Emperor who was well enough sa∣tisfy'd within himself that what was here alledg'd, was the true and undoubted Right of the People of that Kingdom (to observe which he had Sworn at his Coronation) was inclinable to gratifie his People with a con∣cession of these just Privileges;The Rea∣sons why the Empe∣ror denies to allow them. but his Chief Ministers and Councellors disswaded him from it, alledging that such a Conde∣scension as this, would raise again the Spi∣rits of the Malecontents to such a degree, as would blow up the fire of Rebellion in∣to a flame: That it was improper and in∣congruous to put the Tryal of the three Counts into the hands of those who were Conspirators and Complices in the same Plot with them: That the People of Hun∣gary had forfeited all their Charters and Privileges by their Rebellion and Revolt, having sought for aid and protection from the Turks, who are mortal Enemies both of the Emperor, and all Christendom. That Serini, and Nadasti, were actually Officers and Servants of the Emperor; the first be∣ing Vice-King of Croatia, and the other President of his Majesty's Privy-Council; and for that Reason could not decline the Jurisdiction of that Court, which his Im∣perial Majesty should erect for their Tryal. These Reasons being given to the As∣sembly at Leusch, little reply could be made thereunto, nor knew they well how to pro∣ceed in other Matters; in regard that be∣ing compos'd of different Religions and In∣terests, their Meeting broke up abruptly without any Conlusion. It will not be necessary in this place to enlarge upon the several Tryals of the Counts, Serini, Nadasti, and Frangipani; as also of Count Tassembach, and Nagife∣rents Secretary of the League;The three Counts are put to death. let it be sufficient for us, to say that they were all Judicially Arraign'd, and receiv'd Punish∣ments agreeable to the blackness of their Crimes; only we shall add, that Nadasti was Executed at Vienna,  and the same day Serini and Frangipani at Newstadt. The Emperor out of his innate Clemency and Mercy restor'd their Estates in Land to their Children, with Orders only to change their Arms, and Names. And accordingly,Their Chil∣dren change their Names. the Children of Nadasti, which were eleven in number, took the Names of Creuzemberg, and the Son of Serini was call'd Gadé, who was a Gentleman of such Integrity, and of that Loyalty to the Emperor, that when his Father was living, and would have gi∣ven him for a Hostage to the Turks, he re∣fus'd to submit unto such a dishonourable Character, protesting that he would con∣tinue uncorrupt in his Allegiance to his Prince. Howsoever afterwards being pro∣vok'd, and resenting highly the death of his Father, he deserted those Principles, and in revenge joyn'd himself with the Male∣contents in their defection. Tassembach us'd such Arts and Subterfuges, supported by the interest of powerful Friends, as con∣serv'd his Life for seven Months after the death of the aforesaid Lords, tho' after∣wards he was forc'd also to submit unto his Fate. Notwithstanding all this Care and Seve∣rity of the Emperor, the fire of discontent could not be smother'd, but in other places under different Heads and Leaders burst forth into a flame.Count Te∣keli the Father Rebels. Count Tekeli the Fa∣ther was one of those who appear'd openly in the Field; declaring, That tho' he had ever own'd all Fidelity and Allegiance to the Emperor, yet he desir'd to be number'd amongst those good Patriots, who were oblig'd both in Honour, Conscience, and Religion, to maintain and defend the Rights, Privileges and Liberties of their Country.
Count Tekeli to maintain this Cause, fortify'd himself in his Castle of Kus, with a Garrison of 800 Hussars, and caus'd all his Subjects with the Morlaques to take up Arms for his defence. Col. Heister with a considerable Force was dis-speeded to sup∣press this Party, which was the only open Enemy then appearing in the Field; but whilst preparations were making to Besiege this Castle Count Tekeli died therein,Old Tekeli dies. and resign'd up his Cause and Country to be maintain'd by his Son; who afterwards was the grand Incendiary that again kindled the fire of War, which continu'd for many years; and in conclusion miserably wasted the Kingdom of Hungary, and prov'd fatal to the Ottoman Empire. And tho' in course of time the Turks were driven out of that Kingdom, and the Emperor gain'd an ab∣solute Dominion therein, as of a Conquer'd Country, yet it was done with such an effusion of Christian blood, and with the loss of so many brave Captains, and valiant Soldiers, that the price or purchase thereof seems to have been gain'd at a dear rate. His Castle is surren∣der'd.In fine, I say, Count Tekeli the Father dy'd in his Castle, which being hardly press'd by the German Forces, was Sur∣render'd to Count Paul Esterhasi General of the Kingdom. But young Tekeli, together with his Kinsmen, Kizir de Paragozi, and Petrozzi, made their escapes, and retir'd to Licoüa; but being also pursu'd unto that place, which could not long stand out, these young Lords made a second escape from thence by night, and fled to Husse a very strong Castle in Transilvania, but Pa∣ragozi was taken Prisoner in his way thi∣ther, and carried to Vienna, and Licoüa was Surrender'd. Thus whilst all Commotions seem'd to have been appeas'd and quieted in Hungary, and that Esterhasi, the General, with Colonel Heister, were return'd to Vienna, fresh Ad∣vices were brought to the Emperor, that the Chiefs of the Malecontents with great numbers of People were fled into Transilva∣nia, under protection of the Turks, and that Prince Apafi by Order of the Port, had given them assurance of Safety within his Dominions; upon condition that as Sub∣jects, they should pay Carach, or Pole-Money, to the Grand Seignior. But what Administred the greatest apprehension,Fears from Apafi. was the rumour that Apafi had been at Constanti∣nople, and there concerted and agree'd upon the methods of War; and that upon his return the Malecontents had held long Conferences with the Pasha of Varadin, and with the Ambassadors of Tartary, and the Agents from Moldavia, and Walachia; and that all the Troops which were in their Quarters near Adrianople had Orders to march into Hungary, where the Garrisons were to be reinforc'd, and the Stores and Magazines replenish'd.Apafi maintains the Cause of the Malecon∣tents. 'Tis certain that Apafi being of the Protestant Religion, was affected with much compassion towards the poor Hungarians, who for that Reason, and for maintaining the Liberties and Privileges of their Country,  were forc'd to yield up their Lands, and abandon their Habitations; and therefore it will not be strange, in case we find him abetting that Party, and using all his endeavours and interest with the Turks to engage them in this Quarrel. The Emperor on the other side alarm'd with these Preparations,The Empe∣ror alarm'd hereat, treats his Subjects more mildly. sends strict and severe Orders, enjoyning all the Officers and Commanders of his Forces on the Fron∣tiers, carefully to abstain from Incursions within the Dominions of the Turks: And a little to asswage the exasperated Spirits of his discontented Subjects, he resolves to treat them with more kindness, and gentle usage than formerly. And in the mean time, for fear of the worst, and to provide against the dangers so imminently hanging over their heads, he gave Orders that a Survey should be made of all the Maga∣zines and Arsenals on the Frontiers, and an account taken of the Cannon and Arms. But the Emperor remain'd not long in these doubtful apprehensions,The Turks refuse to assist the Malecon∣tents. before he re∣ceiv'd Intelligence from his Envoy, lately dispatch'd to Constantinople to sound the minds and intentions of the Vizier,  that the Grand Seignior did not design a War against the Emperor, and that he had re∣fus'd to hear or receive any Propositions made by the Malecontents.The Reasons why. For whether it was, that this Vizier out of a Principle of Justice deny'd to side or joyn with Re∣bels against their own Prince, or out of a sence of Honour to that Peace which he himself having made, did esteem Sacred. Or whether it was, that he thought a War against Poland at that time would be more Honourable and Advantageous to the Em∣pire; or perhaps all these Considerations together might divert him from designs a∣gainst Hungary. The War was reserv'd for another Vizier, and until the space of ten years afterwards, of which dismal effects we shall discourse in their due places.The Empe∣ror sends Presents to the Grand Seignior. In the mean time the Emperor dis∣patch'd Secretary Perez with Presents to the Grand Seignior, and Grand Vizier, to confirm the Peace, and renew the Truce (for so it may be call'd, rather than a Peace) of twenty years, longer; the which Presents were accepted, and all matters establish'd to the satisfaction of both Princes. Now had the Emperor time to seize on the forfeited Estates of the three Counts, who were lately Executed for High Trea∣son,
so their Jewels and Plate which were very valuable, together with the Treasure of Nadasti,The Estates of the three Counts con∣verted to the use of the Empe∣ror. who was Richer than all the others, were carried on 8 Waggons to Vi∣enna, and the Castle of Puttendorf, with the Gardens and Houses of Pleasure belonging to Nadasti, were given to General Monte∣cuculi. Nor were the moveables of Tekeli the Father lately deceas'd,  together with his Rich Furniture, Jewels, Plate, and Hor∣ses of high price, less considerable than those of the afore-mention'd Lords, all which were converted to the use of the Emperor. Conditions made with Prince RagotskiThe Prince Ragotski, who (as we have said before) proceeded more warily than his other Associates, had seasonably made his peace with the Emperor, and obtain'd his Pardon, on Condition that he should renounce his right of Sovereignty over the Town of Trenschin; That he should send 200000 Florins to that Town for pay∣ment of the Garrison there, and should send a like Sum to the Emperor's Coffers at Vienna, and that he should out of his own Revenue maintain 500 Soldiers in the up∣per Hungary, and supply them with Am∣munition, and all things necessary for the War. The Inha∣bitants and Soldiers of Cassovia Fight.About this time the Inhabitants and Sol∣diers of Kalo, and Tokai, fell at variance together about their Quarters and Provi∣sions; and at Cassovia the Citizens Con∣spir'd to make a Massacre in one Night of all the German Soldiers; but the Plot being discover'd, both sides came to an open Fight together, which continu'd long; but at length the Soldiers gain'd the advantage, having kill'd and made Prisoners almost all the Citizens. A Diet at Presburg.This Accident made but an ill prepara∣tion for a Diet, which the Emperor had Summon'd to meet at Presburg on the first day of the ensuing year, and call'd there∣unto by especial Writ all the Nobility and Deputies of the upper and the lower Hun∣gary. But when the time came, there was but a small appearance; most of the Depu∣ties declaring that they absented themselves, by reason that they would not concur with their own consents to the abrogation of their ancient Laws and Privileges of their Country, which the Emperor design'd to reduce to the same Constitution with that of his Hereditary Dominions. The Depu∣ties afraid to meet.Other Deputies refus'd to appear without Letters of License, or safe Conducts and Pardons from the Emperor for what was formerly done by them in the late Commo∣tions. But this Act of Grace and Cle∣mency being deny'd, by reason of that constant Correspondence which the Male∣contents held with the Turks; the Empe∣ror's Commissioners, namely the Count Rothal, who was Chief Plenipotentiary, the Archbishop of Gran, and others, proceeded to open the Diet upon the 24th of January, to which time the Assembly was adjourn'd; but neither then, nor on the 3d of February, to which time a farther adjournment was made, not one of the Deputies of the upper Hungary making their Appearance, his Majesty being desirous to provide for the safety of his Subjects, even against their own wills, made this following De∣claration; which we have thought fit to insert, for better understanding of this Hi∣story, and contracted for brevity thereof. LEOPOLD, by the Grace of God Em∣peror of the Romans, &c. This is to make known unto all Men, that having happily extinguish'd the Fire of Rebellion in this Our Kingdom of Hungary, and punish'd those ungrateful Persons who were the Chief Incendiaries; and who growing wanton with those Benefits which We had heaped upon them, violated their Bonds of Allegiance to Us, and seducing to their Party many of the Nobility, with divers Towns, and all the Estates of this Kingdom, call'd Strangers to their aid and assistance, and rais'd an Army to oppose Our Power and Dominion. In pur∣suance whereof, they Besieg'd Tokai, where We had plac'd a Garrison, kill'd great num∣bers of Our Soldiers, taken the Convoys which we had sent for supply of Zatmar; fought against that Army which We had sent to suppress the Troubles of Hungary; and to abate and diminish Our Authority, several unlawful Assemblies were held for contriving and carrying on a War against Us; by which Councels Our good Subjects being disturb'd, the Turks Invited into Our Dominions, Our Royal Treasury pillag'd, Incursions made into Austria, Stiria, Moravia, and other Our He∣reditary Dominions, and at length a Conspi∣racy was made against Our Life, which was prevented by the Divine Providence of God Almighty. And now whereas it is a Duty incumbent on Us to provide for the safety of those People which God hath committed to Our Charge; and that Christendom and Hungary may not for the future be expos'd to the like Disorders, We have by Our Ab∣solute Power and Imperial Authority made an exact Regulation of the Military Quarters; allotting the number of Soldiers which every County is to maintain; and the Orders and Decorum which Soldiers are to keep, that they may not molest or trouble the Inhabitants where they are Quarter'd. And We require all Persons concern'd, without Excuse, Delay, or Conditions whatsoever, to submit unto that power which God hath given Us over them;
which We have been compell'd to maintain by force of Arms, and which We shall con∣tinue so to do. And therefore We give no∣tice to all Our Subjects, that they peaceably submit unto Our power, lest Our Clemency be turn'd into Severity; and that contrary to Our Nature, being provok'd by so many Inju∣ries, Treasons, and Rebellions, We be en∣forc'd to execute Our Wrath on those who have abus'd Our Indulgence, and cause them to taste the direful effects of Our Rigour. Given at Vienna the 21st of March, 1671. The Decla∣ration en∣forced.The Emperor to establish and confirm this his Remonstrance by force of Arms, caused his Regiments which were in Bohemia, Silesia, Moravia and Austria to march with speed in∣to Hungary, with Cannon and all the Train of Artillery: Which when the Malecontents perceived, and consider'd their ill Fortune and Successes, having in every place been worsted in all the Fights and Reencounters against the Emperor's Forces, and that the Grand Vizier had forbidden Apafi Prince of Transilvania, and all the Pashas of Hungary to yield Assistance or Protection to them: They began then to think they had taken false Courses against their Sovereign Prince; and resolved for the future to submit with blind obedience to the Commands and De∣crees of the Emperor,The Hun∣garians re∣pent, but too late. serving themselves only of Prayers and Petitions to obtain his Pardon, and a remission of his Rigours and Oppressions. But it was now too late, for his Imperial Majesty being highly provok'd by their frequent Rebellions, was so far from granting their Requests; That besides their usual Taxes and Impositions, he laid a farther charge on them of maintaining an Army of 30.000 Men, which were quar∣ter'd in their Cities and Towns, and upon their Lands and Estates of Inheritance. With these Successes, and the Destruction and Death of the Chief Leaders of the Malecontented Party: Hungary was con∣sider'd by the Imperialists as a Conquered Kingdom,  and therefore to be subjected un∣to such Laws, as the Emperor should please to impose upon them.The Em∣peror al∣ters the Govern∣ment of Hungary. The great Office and Dignity of Palatine, who was always a Person of the noblest Descent and highest Degree; was by the ancient Privileges of that Kingdom elected at a Diet, consisting of the several Orders of the Nation: But now the Emperor assumed this Power unto himself, pretending that the same was for∣feited to him by the Revolt of the People; and so in the lieu of Palatine, he thought fit to Govern by such a Person as he him∣self should chuse, and impose without the Concurrence of the States, by the Name and Title of Vice King: And in lieu, and by way of resemblance of a Diet, he erected a Sovereign Chamber, or Council consisting of a President, Chanceller, and two Secretaries, one a German and the other a Hungarian, with about six or seven Councellors, or so many as his Imperial Majesty should think fit to add, to whom the Administration of all the Affairs of that Kingdom was committed. The Person destinated and appointed for this considerable charge, was John Gasper Ampringhen Prince of the Empire, and Grand Master of the Teutonick Order, which was an Office so considerable, that the late Arch-Duke Leopold, Uncle to the present Emperor, did not disdain to own; this Prince being an Hungarian by Birth, and qualified with many Vertues, and having perform'd many brave Actions and Atchievements, was esteemed worthy of this August honour. His zeal for Religion, and advancement of the Christian Cause was well known to all the World;The chara∣cter of the Grand Ma∣ster of the Teutonick Order. having in the year 1664 brought two Regiments, one of Horse and the o∣ther of Foot to the Imperial Army, com∣manded by the Cavaliers of his own Or∣der, and maintained at his own expence during all the time that that War lasted. After which, and that the Turks renew'd their War again in Candia, he sent a considerable body of Foot, Commanded by several Cava∣liers of his own Order, into the Service of the Venetian Republick; and afterwards went himself in Chief to Command them within the besieged City, where he perform'd such noble Actions of Chivalry, as obtain'd the acknowledgement of the Senate, and pro∣cured likewise a Brief from the Pope with such obliging Expressions, as denoted the singular esteem he had of his Person and Merits. In fine, such were the deserts and qualifications of this Grand Master, that the Emperor remain'd entirely satisfied with his Abilities, as being agreeable and every ways suiting with this Honourable Promo∣tion; to which being called, he appeared at Vienna, attended with a great and an expen∣sive Equipage, and with many Knights of his own Order. ANNO 1673. This new Vice-King having taken his Instructions, and Leave from the Em∣peror departed from Vienna, and made his En∣try into Cassovia on the 22d day of March, with Acclamations and universal Content∣ment of the People. Great was the expe∣ctation which the World conceived of the wisdom and good conduct of this new Vice-King, as the only person who was able to appease the Disturbances, and compose the Disorders of that Kingdom. And indeed he so well behaved himself, together with
the Sovereign Council over which he pre∣sided, that Justice took its course, the Poor were relieved from the Oppression of their unmerciful Lords, and a stop given to the proceedings of those wickednesses,The good Govern∣ment of the Vice-King. which in the Licentious times of War had passed without punishment: All orders of Men began now to yield due obedience to their Superiours, Innocence was protected and Offences punished; the Soldiers lived under the good Discipline of their Officers, and the Citizens in good Correspondence with the Soldiers. Many wholsome Laws were made for the benefit of the People, and for their Security from the violence of the Army, especially in their Marches. And above all the Vice-King endeavoured to reconcile the affections of the Malecontents by his gen∣tleness, and moderation towards them. The Clergy disturb the quiet of the Country.But what the Civil Magistrates acted in order to a composure and setlement, was di∣sturbed and over-thrown by the Ecclesiasti∣cal Courts, whose business being to extir∣pate Heresie (as they called it) thy proceeded by methods agreeable thereunto, which were to take away their Churches, Seize and Imprison their Pastors and Teachers, and prosecute the People with the severity of their Courts: The which Persecutions so exasperated the Spirits of the Protestants against the Emperor and his Government, that the Fire of War, which had for some time been cover'd with Embers, was ready to break out into a more violent Flame than before:A War breaks out. For now the Protestants were encouraged by an Alliance they had made with the Transilvanians, and by the Prote∣ction which the Turk had promised to give them within his Dominions, notwithstan∣ding the assurances formerly made to the Emperor by the Vizier to the contrary. The Transilvanians pretended a quarrel for reco∣very of the Counties of Zatmar and Zam∣bolich belonging to their Principality, which the Prince Ragotski had without right yield∣ed to the Emperor. The Turks declared themselves offended, by the daily Hostili∣ties committed by the Imperialists, who pursuing the Malecontents within their Do∣minions, did not abstain from those Vio∣lences, which are usually practised in an Enemies Country; and by such Actions as these, both Nations were ready to break forth into an open Rupture. With these hopes and encouragements, the Malecontents betook themselves again to their Arms under the Command of Erdedi, Petrozzi, Succhai, Kende, Zepeti, and se∣veral other Lords, and Persons of power and interest in their Country. The time appear'd favourable and advantageous to their enterprise, for the Walls of most of the Towns were then beaten down, and the old Works slighted, with design to Rebuild, and make them stronger according to the new way and manner of Fortifications.The time chosen for the War. Provisions were also wanting in most of the Garrisons, and the German, as well as the Hungarian Troops were in Mutiny for want of pay. And this was the time, which the Malecontents chose to put themselves in Arms, and renew the War. At the beginning whereof being 12000 strong, they gain'd the Passage of Teyllas,  Colonel Soy∣er defeated. and advanced as far as Cassovia, which they blocked up, and Defeated five Troops of Dragoons, under the Command of Lieu∣tenant Colonel de Soyer, and by the advan∣tage of a dark and a rainy Night cut them to pieces, the Lieutenant Colonel only with some few of his Soldiers making an escape into Cassovia. After this Success they pro∣ceeded to Esperies and took it without much loss, by the Cowardice of the Officer which Commanded it; and in divers other Skir∣mishes worsted the Imperialists. The Emperor having received advices of this new Insurrection,The Impe∣rialists re∣venge themselves. immediately dis-speed-General Kops with an Army of 10.000 Men into Hungary, to which were 4 or 5000 Men more joyned under the Command of Count Esterhasi, and Valentine Balassi, composed almost all of Horse, and of Men true and loyal to the Emperor's interest. Such an Army as this could not remain long with∣out Action, both Parties desiring to come to an Engagement, which soon afterwards happened at the Passage of Branitza; where Colonel Smith and Count Palfi, who led the Van-guard charged the Malecontents who defended some narrow Passes with so much valour, that they killed a 1000 of them on the place, besides many others who were wounded and taken Prisoners, with the loss only of 15 or 16 Soldiers. After this Defeat,  the Malecontents march∣ed by the way of Serentz, about two Leagues distant from Tokai, and invested Zatmar; but a Sally being made out of the Town by Lieutenant Colonel Staremberg, who Commanded there in Chief, they were for∣ced to raise their Siege, with the loss of several Colours and many Prisoners: Like∣wise General Kops and Spankau pursued them so closely at the Heels, that with great loss and difficulty they were enforced to pass the Theyss. Divers places at the same time surrender'd, as the Castle of Meges, and the Town of Nagibania, the which places were dismantled, and their Walls thrown down: And as the Imperialists were towards the end of the year, returning to their Winter quarters, they met a party of 500 Horse belonging to the Malecontented party, of which they killed 300 on the place, and took divers Prisoners, one of
which was the Son of Succhai, one of the Chief Leaders of the Rebel party. Thus whil'st it went ill in all places with the Malecontents, the Popish Clergy took courage to assert their right to divers Churches and Chapels,The Roman Clergy seize on the Protestant Churches. which they pre∣tended to belong unto them, and to those of their Religion, and by force of Arms took possession of them, which they held until such time,  as that the Protestant par∣ty became strong enough to eject them, and executed this design without much opposition in all the Counties of Nitria, Trenschin, Turoz, Stranian, Lippovia, and in several Towns and Villages of the Moun∣tains; where they set up and exercised the Popish Religion, with all the Rites and Ceremonies, to the great Scandal and Dis∣pleasure of the Hungarians. Particularly in the Month of June, at a Town called Senetz, the Curate of the Parish was zealous to celebrate in a publick, and solemn man∣ner the Festival of Corpus Christi,A Bloody Outrage committed. and to carry the Sacrament in Procession: Which Feast happening to be on a day, when a Fair was held at that Town, which brought a great concourse of People thither, the Priest fearing some affront from the Multi∣tude, desired the Governour of Branitz to afford him a Serjeant and 12 Soldiers to accompany the Sacrament, and defend it from the violence and prophaneness of the Hereticks. Which being granted, as the Priest was carrying the Sacrament in Pro∣cession, he was assaulted by the People, and killed by them, together with the 12 Soldiers which were sent for his Guard. So soon as Count Staremberg had news of this Sacrilegious Murder, he marched to the Town with his own Regiment, and seve∣ral Troops of German Horse, for punishment of the Authors of this abominable wicked∣ness;It is re∣venged. which he executed with all the Rigour and Severity imaginable; for he pillaged and burned their Houses, and put every one to the Sword, excepting those who saved their Lives by escaping into the Woods. After all these Defeats and many others given to the Malecontents, and this vast effusion of Blood, it might well be imagin'd, that an end would have been put to this War,The obsti∣nacy of the Malecon∣tents. which had neither a setled Council, nor a Fund of Money, nor an Interest of great Men to support it. Howsoever, such was the force and power, which the Preach∣ers used in their Sermons to the People, inciting them to a Defence of their Religion, the Exercise of which the Emperor (as they said) had determined to take from them, that they resolved to die in the main∣tenance thereof; being perswaded that their Friends and Companions, who had already sacrificed their Lives in that Cause, were real Martyrs, and had obtained the Crown which was laid up in Heaven for them. Nor were the Protestants only in the mind to Wage a War, but even the Roman Ca∣tholicks also, who being moved by another Principle of defending the Privileges and Freedom of their People, thought it their Duty to rise up and assert the Cause of their native Country and Nation. For tho' they owned all Duty and Obedience to the Emperor, yet being but an Elective King, and one to whom the People had sworn Allegiance on Condition that he should main∣tain them in the ancient Rights, and Pri∣leges of that Kingdom, they held them∣selves no longer obliged thereunto, after he had violated all their Laws, and absolutely subverted the ancient Fabrick of their Go∣vernment, which he had apparently done in three instances. First,The aggrie∣vances of the Hunga∣rians. In quartering Ger∣man Soldiers in the Country and Towns, with intent to over-awe and govern them by an absolute and an arbitrary Power. Second∣ly, By imposing a Vice-King upon them, constituted solely by the Imperial Commis∣sion, in lieu and place of a Palatine, who according to the ancient Constitutions was to be elected by a Diet, composed of the several Estates of that Kingdom. And Thirdly, Instead of such a Diet the Empe∣ror was pleased to erect a Sovereign Coun∣cil consisting of such Members, as he him∣self did think fit to nominate and appoint, over which the Vice-King was as Chief Commissioner to preside. And thus the Parties of both Religions being disgusted and animated to Fight pro Aris & Focis, for their Laws, their Country and Religion; Fury and Despair served them in the place of Counsel, Money, and other Nerves and Sinews of War: So that when one party was cut off, another arose in greater num∣bers, and like Hydra's increased the more by being destroyed. Amongst which appear'd a bold Fellow nam'd Strisiniski, who pretended to be sent by the Governors of the Mountain Towns, calling himself Duke John, and with his own name signed and issued out Com∣missions, and dispersed them every where, as if he had been the Sole and Sovereign Prince of that Country. Many persons ad∣her'd to him, and followed his Standard, looking on him as a bold and a daring Fel∣low, who seldom gave quarter to any, much less to Jesuits and Priests,Cruelties exercised on both sides. to whom he never showed mercy, whensoever any of that character fell within his Power. The which was again revenged by Count Stra∣zoldo,  in such cruel manner without distin∣ction of persons, either of guilty or inno∣cent, that the Imperial Council taking
notice thereof, sent their Orders to him to use better moderation in his future actings, and to treat the Hungarians with more gen∣tleness; which tho' he observed in respect to the Sword of his own Souldiers, who were forbidden to Massacre, or shed their Blood; yet being directed to take and bring them before the Courts of Justice, by which a speedy Sentence was passed, and some were condemned to be hanged, some be quarter'd, others to be empaled, this way of process seemed much more cruel and severe, than a speedy Execution by the Sword of the Soldiery. ANNO, 1674. The Turks underhand assist the Malecon∣tents.Tho' the Grand Seignior had not as yet publickly own'd the cause of the Malecon∣tents; howsoever the Pasha's and Officers had receiv'd private Instructions to coun∣tenance and favour their Cause, without open denunciations of a War, and many Turks in hopes of Plunder and Booty habi∣ted themselves in the Hungarian fashion, and joyn'd with their Troops; and several parties of Turks in great numbers, pretend∣ing that the Christians in a Hostile manner had made Incursions within their Territo∣ries, came openly to revenge them, and march'd as far as Schentha, from whence they carried away an Hungarian Gentleman with 7 Soldiers. Upon this Advice, Lieu∣tenant Colonel de Soyer with his Dragoons, and Hussars, Sallied out of the Town to the rescue of the Prisoners; but being sur∣priz'd by 5 Companies of Turkish Foot, who issued out of an Ambuscade, where they had conceal'd themselves, Soyer him∣self was kill'd, with 2 Lieutenants, 1 En∣sign, 4 Serjeants, and 80 common Sol∣diers. The Garrison of Newhawsel encourag'd with this Success, continu'd their Incursions along the River of Waagh, and made some depredations; but being pursu'd by the Hussars, and Heydukes of Comorra, they were forc'd to surrender 200 Head of Cat∣tle, together with all the Booty and Plun∣der they had taken. Other Cru∣elties per∣formed.Thus whilst Matters succeeded with va∣rious Successes, but most commonly in fa∣vour of the Emperor, both Parties acted their Cruelties upon each other, the Male∣contents as often as the Priests fell into their hands, they us'd them but very scur∣vily; they buried one of them alive, of others they cut off their Noses and Ears, and hanged or strangled others. In punish∣ment of which, the Emperor Order'd the Vice-King to drive the Protestant Ministers out of his Dominions, and to seize upon all their Churches to the use of the Catho∣licks; and not to suffer them to meet or exercise their Religious Worship therein. In pursuance of these Orders,The Popish Bishops seize the Livings of the Hunga∣rian Clergy. the Bishops of Colonitz, and Javarow seiz'd upon all the Churches, Schools, Livings, and Be∣nefices whatsoever belonging to the Prote∣stant Clergy within their Diocesses. And the Archbishop of Strigonium, Primate of that Kingdom, cited all the Protestant Mi∣nisters to appear before him, and put many of them to the Question, forcing them to confess who those were who for the two last years were the chief Incendiaries of Seditions, and Authors of the Rebellion. Nor were the smaller sort of the Male∣contents only persecuted, but some of the great Men and chief Ministers in the Em∣peror's Court were suspected, and accused of correspondence and intelligence with the Rebels.The Prince Lubkovitz suspected, and his Estate seiz'd. The Prince Lubkovitz President of the Council was suspected and accus'd; but whether that jealousie arose from the near alliance in Blood he had with the Fa∣mily of Serini, or from malicious Informa∣tions is uncertain; howsoever his Secretary by Order of the Emperor was put to the Torture; and tho' therein he confess'd no∣thing which could accuse or reflect on his Master, yet he was treated as a guilty person, and all his Estate real and personal in Austria and Bohemia were seiz'd, and confiscated to the use and benefit of the Emperor. Count Souches had the like misfortune to have his Fidelity and Loyalty suspected, but in regard nothing could be prov'd a∣gainst him, he was commanded to leave the Court, and retire to his Government of Waradine, or some other part of his Estate. The Son also in resentment of this hard usage of his Father, abandon'd the Court, and all the Offices he enjoy'd therein. ANNO, 1675. At the beginning of this year the Turks began more openly to assert the Cause of the Malecontents,The Turks joyn with the Male∣contents. making their Incursions as far as Freystadt within the Neighbourhood of Presburg; forcing the People to do Ho∣mage, and pay Contributions to the Grand Seignior; and for default thereof, they burnt many Villages, and committed other acts of Hostility. The Malecontents at the same time defeated a great part of a Croatian Regiment, under the Command of Colalto. By which, and the Advices that the Turks were assembled in a Body of 14000 Men, within the Neighbourhood of Newhawsel, the Emperor fearing lest they should joyn with the Malecontents, con∣vened the chief Lords and Gentlemen of Hungary at Presburg,The Empe∣ror assem∣bles a Diet at Presburg to which place he
sent Count Siaki to tender them Conditions of an accommodation, of which Prince Apafi frankly offer'd himself to be the Me∣diator. At this Assembly some of the more mo∣derate Men, who were desirous to bring Matters to a good understanding, repre∣sented unto their Companions the ruine and destruction which must necessarily en∣sue from a Civil War; and tho' the ex∣ercise of their Religion ought to be dearer to them than their Lives, and to be pre∣ferr'd before all earthly benefits; yet the same Religion taught them not to rebel against their Prince, or make Wars for the sake thereof, whose foundation and design was peace; much less could they justifie the engaging the Turk therein, un∣less whilst they profess'd themselves Pro∣testants, they acted like Mahometans. But these and many other things were spoken in vain to Men who were possess'd with a Zeal for their Religion,  and with an Opinion that they were Martyrs who died in defence thereof.The People possess'd with Zeal to their Religion. And in regard those of them who were in Hungary were not able to keep the Field, they were forc'd to flie and seek refuge in Transilva∣nia, to the number of 5000. from whence they sent one Fabian to Constantinople to Sollicit for assistance from the Grand Seig∣nior; but the Affairs of the Turks not be∣ing as yet in a state for answering such de∣mands, Fabian return'd with fair words, and with Orders to Prince Apafi to give protection, and to assign Quarters to as many Malecontents as should seek for re∣fuge within the Principality of Transilva∣nia, to which Country tho' the chief Heads and Leaders of that party were retired, yet there were several flying Troops in Hungary which infested the Country, and drove away Cattle from parts near unto the Gates of Zatmar, and burnt all the Villages round, which would not assent to pay the contributions they demanded of them. In the mean time the Grand Master of the Teutonick Order, now Vice-King of Hungary, together with the Archbishop of Gran, and other Chiefs of the several Estates, having had divers Conferences about the Condi∣tion of that Kingdom, and of the manner how they might raise a considerable Sum of Money towards maintenance of the Troops which for conservation of the Peace were sent into that Country; but not being able to agree thereupon, nor upon what Fund the same might be levied, they went to Presburg with design to renew the Treaty with the Malecontents;A Treaty renew'd at Presburg. that coming to a good understanding with them, a Tax or Imposition might be equally charged by the common consent and agreement of the Estates; and which coming with that Authority would be paid frankly without scruple, or opposition of the People. To bring Matters to this happy condition, the Vice-King offer'd in the Name of the Emperor, to grant a General Act of Par∣don unto all those who would lay down their Arms, and submit to the Emperor's Au∣thority; promising that they should be re∣stor'd to their Lands and Estates, and to a free exercise of their Religion; but in re∣gard they were oblig'd to receive German Soldiers into all their Fortresses and Towns; all offers seem'd grievous and of no force, in respect of the oppression they must find by such unruly Guests, under whom they could promise themselves no enjoyment or security; and being by these proposals be∣come more bold and desperate, they ap∣pear'd before Zatmar with about 7000 Men;  upon whom the Governor of that place adventuring to make a Sally, was beaten back with great loss. Prince Apafi who had at all times under∣hand favour'd the cause of the Malecon∣tents,Apafi seeks a quarrel. and granted them protection within his Dominions, did now begin openly to seek a quarrel on his own score with the Emperor, demanding the Counties of Kalo and Zatmar to be deliver'd to him, with the Fortress of Tokai, to which he pre∣tended a Right by a grant from Prince Ragotski his Predecessor. To which An∣swer was made, That those Counties were of the Ancient Demesnes belonging to the Kings of Hungary, and since confirm'd to the Emperor by several Treaties; and par∣ticularly by the last made with the Otto∣man-Port. Howsoever, not to irritate Prince Apafi over-much, and to keep Matters from an open rupture at a time when the Empe∣ror had many Enemies to deal with, it was Order'd that these Demands should be referr'd to the Examination of Commis∣sioners; and in the mean time an Envoy was sent to the Vizier at Adrianople, to complain of those exorbitant pretensions. But Apafi not attending an Answer, entred with a formidable Force into Hungary, and having defeated General Spankau, he laid Siege to Zatmar; but the Season of the Year being far spent, and a Valiant Resist∣ance made, they were forc'd to raise the Siege, and retire. About the 15th of September,The Male∣c ntents hold a Con∣ference to∣gether. the Winter approaching, the Malecontents held a Con∣ference at Sombro, a place in Transilvania, to resolve in what manner to manage the next Campagne, and how they might best engage the Turks in their Defence and Quar∣rel, without which they could not hope for
any great Success. After which meeting they entered the County of Zipt, and there set Fire to many Towns and Villages, and took above 500 Prisoners; About the same time the Garrison of Newhawsel, both Horse and Foot made an Incursion as far as Pres∣burg,  Acts of Ho∣stility. and burnt several Villages depending thereupon, and surprized a Castle guarded by the Heydukes, whom they put to the Sword, without sparing so much as one Person.A new Vi∣zer ar∣rves at Buda. Whilest these things were acting, a new Vizier arrived at Buda, where the Turks were making great Stores, and lay∣ing in Provisions both of Victuals and Am∣munition: On which occasion the Emperor sent Messigni, his Interpreter, to Comple∣ment the Vizier upon his happy arrival at Buda, and to carry him the accustomed pre∣sents; with instructions to discover under∣hand the designs and intentions of the Turks, who every day under pretence of Contributions committed a thousand Acts of Hostility: Of which, tho' complaints were made, and no satisfaction given thereunto; yet the Emperor thought fit to seek redress for these violences, rather by ap∣plications to the Port than by Reprisals,Applicati∣ons to the Port, least the Turk should be provoked thereby, and furnish'd with just Causes to commence a War. To prevent which, all caution and tenderness was used towards the Turks, and endeavours made by Cardiati one of the Emperor's Council,And to Prince A∣pafi with∣out effect. who was sent to Prince Apafi to Treat, and propose ways of an Accommodation: But these labours were all fruitless, for notwithstanding the regard was had not to molest, or provoke the Turk, a Chiaus arrived at Vienna from the Pasha of Buda, to complain of the Fort of Schella, which the Emperor was making on the Banks of the Waagh, to ruin which the Turks had raised a Battery just over against it, on the other side of the River;The Forts of Schella and Schei∣nau give offence to the Turks. but in despight thereof the Work went on, and the Fortification was finish'd: And so was the Fort of Scheinau, upon which a thousand Men were daily employ'd, guarded with a considerable party of Horse and Foot, sufficient to repulse the Enemy that should attempt to disturb the Work: Of which when complaints were made by the Pasha of Buda, requiring that they should be demolish'd; and that a new As∣signment should be made of the Limits of the Empire, in which all the places as far as Presburg should be included, and the Inha∣bitants thereof now Subjects to the Empe∣ror, commanded to pay homage to the Grand Seignior: To which unreasonable demands, general answers were only given, with intent to prolong the unhappy day, and stave off the Turks, as long as was possible from an open War. But neither this, nor other Acts of Grace nor the Orders given to the Governor of Raab,The Turks grow proud with con∣cessions. to set several Turkish Prisoners at Li∣berty without Ransom, (which the Garrisons of this place, and the Heydukes of Vesprin had taken) did not soften or satisfie the Turks, who at the same time kept many of the Emperors Subjects in Prison, without thoughts of making the like generous Returns: And likewise the Malecontents proceed∣ing in their usual Hostile manner, defeated some of the Emperor's Troops, and plun∣der'd many Waggons laden with Merchan∣dize coming from Molda Fair, and killed all the Guard which convoy'd them: And thus ended this troublesome year. ANNO 1676. The Heats and Troubles of the People of Hungary increased with some; and as years passed, so the quarrel grew higher. Blood had been drawn so frequently, that one would think the Spirits of Hungary might have been evacuated by such vast effusions. The Malecontents had provok'd their Sovereign beyond hopes of Pardon; and had no expectations of safety but in the Turk; with whom tho' the Emperor had no mind to break, nor yet the Turks on the other side, during the Government of the Vizier Kupriogli, who being as yet engaged in a War against Poland, thought it not season∣able to come unto an open Rupture with Germany: Yet so unhappily were the Af∣fairs of the Malecontents interwoven with the concernments of the Turks, that it was impossible to be avenged of one, without irritating and disturbing the other. For so it was at the beginning of this year, when the Count Strazoldo took Debrezin,Debrezin taken by Count Stra∣zoldo. a Town into which great numbers of the Rebels were retreated, and there held their Cabals: But in regard it was a place which paid Tribute to the Port;The Turks much enra∣ged there∣by. the taking thereof put all the Turkish Governors and Officers into an Alarm, and to so loud an Outcry of an open breach of the Peace, that tho' this Act was perform'd by Order of the Emperor; yet he was forced to disown it, and cause Strazoldo to Surrender up the same into the hands of the Turks, and to take away all jealousie, to retire over the Theysse with his Forces;Disowned by the Em∣peror. and after all this to divert the Storm, a Gentleman was dispatch∣ed to the Pasha of Buda, to excuse the matter, and testifie the high displeasure of the Emperor for this Action, declaring that it was perform'd wholly without his Order. Tho' the Pasha of Buda seem'd indifferently well appeased with this address, and satis∣faction which was given; yet the Pasha of Newhawsel continued his Displeasure; and
on the pretence of Debrezin, grounded his Reasons, why he would not set divers Pri∣soners at liberty, notwithstanding the Ran∣som which was paid for them, and treated very scurvily and unworthily many Persons of considerable quality, who were in the number of those Prisoners. The Malecontents being much encoura∣ged, by these misunderstandings between the Imperialists and the Turks, fell upon a body of 600 Cuirasiers and cut them to pieces:The Rebells refuse to Trea. And after another Fight between a party of Hussars commanded by Count Esterhasi, and the Turks near Carolstadt in Croatia, in which the Turks were worsted; and after many other Acts of Hostility, being well assured that the Peace could not continue long, refused to hearken unto any Terms or Conditions whatsoever, tho' again offer'd to them with advantage by Count Palfi, and the Bishop of Agria. And indeed the Vizier himself, tho' inclinable in his own nature to conserve the Truce which he himself had concluded in the year 1664,The Vizier makes peace with the Poles. until the full Term of 20 years, had been expir'd according to the usual Customs and Constitutions of both Empires: Yet finding how impossible in a manner it was, to re∣main unconcern'd,The Rea∣sons for it. whilest the Emperor pur∣sued his Rebels within his Dominions; and that the Soldiers and Inhabitants of neither side being bred up to War, could be kept within any Rules or Government; he then clapt up a Peace with the Poles, that in case he should be induced to declare War against the Emperor, and march into Hun∣gary, he might have but one business, and one War on his Hands at the same time to manage. The state of these Affairs animated the Malecontents in such manner,The Male∣contents have suc∣cess against the Impe∣rialists. that they adventur'd to fall into the Head quarters of Colonel Colalto near Zatmar, where they cut three Companies to pieces, and took some Prisoners. And in the Month of June, a party of them consisting of 4000, encoun∣tring with the Regiment of Colonel Smith near Kalo, gave them a total Defeat, killing 300 upon the place. In the Month of July, two Parties of the Malecontents, one of 1500, and another of 600, pillaged and burnt all the places, and Villages near Zat∣mar and Caschau, and defeated a Croatian Regiment under the Command of Count Palfi, with a Detachment from the two foregoing Garrisons. Another party of them burnt two Villages in the Upper Hun∣gary, killed most of the Inhabitants, and carried away great plunder and booty with them: And being met by Count Strazoldo, who was desirous to intercept them in their Retreat, he was defeated by them, and for∣ced to fly with considerable loss: Another party of them surprized the Castle of Balac in the Morning, just at the moment when the Gates were open'd, and killed, and made Prisoners all the People that were in it. The same party defeated Colonel Sche∣veling, and killed many of his Hussars up∣on the place; they took and pillaged the little Town of Newtra, and intercepted all the Merchandice, which was carrying to the Fair of Stoez.They grow proud there∣with. And with such Successes as these, the Malecontents being greatly puf∣fed up and exalted, they demanded a Con∣tribution of 14000 Florins from the Inha∣bitants of the plain Countries, and took Hostages, as a security for payment there∣of. Nor were the Turks in the mean time idle, or unactive on their side, for from the Garrison of Buda, they sent a very strong party to joyn with those of Newhawsel, with design to take and demolish the Fort of Schella; whilest the Malecontents attended the motions of the Imperialists with 8000 Men, and the Transilvanians marched to∣wards the Frontiers of their Country with 10000; but by the care and vigilance of the Emperor's Soldiers, the design was pre∣vented. These misfortunes were followed by others of worse consequence, for the Generals, Smith and Baragotzi,Smith and Baragotzi defeated. were defeated by the Malecontents in divers Incounters. The Towns of Oedembourg, Zaltach and Dowar were plunder'd and burnt by them; and so greatly they increased in their numbers, that Strazoldo with 3000 Men durst not ap∣pear in the Field against them. And now that the fate of War might be determined,Advices of the Death of the Grand Vi∣zier Ach∣met Kupri∣ogli. advices of the Death of the Grand Vizier Achmet Kupriogli were brought to Vienna, by which all expectations of Peace failed: For by the Answers he had made to the Malecontents, who sollicited for assistance, and to the Imperial Ministers, who labour'd to continue a good under∣standing, he evidenced an aversion to this War, for Reasons which we have former∣ly declar'd: And perhaps because at that time becoming Sick and Crasy, his Spirits were low and his Thoughts rather inclin∣ing to Ease and Quietness, than to the bu∣stles and business of an active and raging War.Kara Mu∣stapha mad Vi∣zir resol∣ves upon a War. But now Kara Mustapha succeeding into his place, a Person of that Temper, which we have before described, the Imperi∣alists despair'd of a Peace, and accordingly provided for a War; and indeed, consider∣ing the Temper of the Man, and the con∣juncture of the present Times; being in∣vited into Hungary, and the way open'd in∣to Germany by the Malecontents; and (as the Common Rumor will have it) pushed on by Encouragements and Promises from the
French Court, but more especially by their own Fate, the Dice of Fortune were cast, and a War determin'd, tho' contrary to the Inclinations of the Grand Seignior, the Mufti, and other Councellors of State. ANNO, 1677. War not as yet denoun∣ced, and why.But to carry on a War of such weight and consequence, preparations were to be first made; Money was to be provided, which was amass'd, and gather'd by such means as we have before related; Forces were to be call'd from the most remote parts of the Empire, and great stores of all sorts of Provisions and Ammunition were to be lodg'd in Belgrade, Buda, and the Frontier Garrisons, all which requir'd some years to effect. And in the mean time, as a prelude to this devouring War, the Male∣contents were to be encourag'd,The Pashas of Hungary Order'd to aid the Malecon∣tents. their hopes kept up, and the Pashas of Hungary al∣low'd to succor them as occasion requir'd; which they acted with so little regard to the Peace, that nothing was heard over all that Kingdom, but daily Slaughters, Bat∣tels, Plundrings, Firing of Towns, and all the other direful effects of War. Incursions made by the Turks.Accordingly, to begin this Year, six thousand Turks passed the Raab over the Ice near Furstemberg, which gave an alarm to all the Province of Stiria. About the same time another party of them belong∣ing to the Garrison of Canisia, made a Sally from thence, with design to surprize the Island of Serini; but being disappointed in that Enterprize, they put all the Country of Croatia into a confusion, and forc'd Contributions from the People by Military Executions; burning and plundring all those Towns and places which refus'd to comply with the payment of such Taxes as they impos'd upon them. And likewise another party from Newhawsel, made In∣cursions to the very Gates of Freystadt. These ill Successes, and the fears of a more dreadful War impending, moved the Imperial Councel to thoughts of Accommo∣dation with the Malecontents on any terms whatsoever, being almost droven to a ne∣cessity of making peace.New Over∣tures made to the Male∣contents. In pursuance of which Resolution, General Baragotzi, who for his Services was lately made a Count of the Empire, and one of the Lieutenant Generals of the Armies, was dispatch'd to the Malecontents with new Overtures of Peace, the sum of which was this: That besides the Act of Oblivion, and Pardon formerly offer'd, the Emperor was pleas'd farther to condescend, that in every Coun∣ty the Protestants should have two Chur∣ches allow'd them, one for the Lutherans, and another for the Calvinists, with full Liberty to exercise the Religion they pro∣fess'd; and that they should be indiffe∣rently admitted into all Offices and Places of Trust either Civil or Military, together with the Roman Catholicks, without any distinction whatsoever, unless with respect to the ability and quality of the person. This Ge∣nerous Offer, tho' it affected and inclin'd about 1500 of that party to abandon the inte∣rest of their Associates, yet there were a∣bove 10000 others whose Spirits were ex∣asperated and heated above the vertue and power of any lenitive,Their Ob∣stinacy. whom nothing could appease nor soften but revenge, tho' at the dear price of their Countries ruine, and the loss of their own Lives. And this Opinion was softer'd and kept up by some ill Men, who perswaded the Commonalty that there was no security nor Faith in the Emperor's promises; which would no lon∣ger continue, than until such time as he saw them disarmed, and his Enemies at his feet. Howsoever, not wholly to reject the terms of peace, Commissioners were ap∣pointed on both sides to meet at Esperies, to offer and receive the Propositions; which Treaty continu'd during the whole Month of March, and at last concluded without any considerable effect; only Count Palaffi Imbre became so touch'd with a sense of his Duty, that he embrac'd the Pardon, and accepted the gracious Offers made him by his Imperial Majesty; and afterwards had a Command given him in Hungary, under Major General Baragotzi; in expectation that by his Example others would be brought to Obedience. But in Transilvania the displeasure of that Prince grew higher,A Plot against Apafi. upon discovery of a Plot against his Life, carried on by those who had more Zeal than true Understand∣ing of the Emperor's Interest; which cau∣sed Apafi, not without some reason, to de∣clare himself more than formerly in behalf of the Malecontents. And so high were the Spirits of both Parties exasperated a∣gainst each other, that the Hussars pursuing a flying party of the Malecontents as far as Rima, now a Town belonging to the King of Poland, in the Palatinate of Cracovia, could not contain their fury against their Enemy with any respect to the Prince or Dominion unto which they were fled; but in the heat of their pursuit set fire to the Town. Which rash Act was so far re∣sented by the King of Poland, that it had caused a War between the two Crowns, had not some other Considerations ce∣mented the difference, and the common safety united the two Princes against their powerful Enemy, as will appear some years after. Howsoever, in the mean time, the King of Poland touch'd with a sense of
this Disgrace, gave License to some of his Troops (of whose assistance he had not much farther occasion,The King of Poland gives leave to some o his Troops to serve the Male∣contents. after the Peace concluded with the Turk) to joyn with the Malecontents, and serve against the Em∣peror, under the Command of Count Bo∣ham. These Polanders to the number of 6000, departed from Seratin on the 25th of Sep∣tember,The Poles March into Transilva∣nia. taking their March directly to∣wards Transilvania; to which Country this Count Boham had dispatch'd his Major Ge∣neral Frebual before, to advise the Prince and Nobility of his coming. The which News was so welcom, that 500 Horse, and 800 Foot were Order'd from a Castle ap∣pertaining to Wessellini to meet them on their way, and joyn in a Body with them. These Troops conducted by Frebual, met the Polish Forces at the Village of Nemet, on the Banks of the Theysse, about four Leagues distant from Mongatz; and having pass'd that River, they Encamp'd near the Village of Nimelsi, about 2 leagues from Zatmar, where they attended the coming of Wessellini, the Hungarian General, with his Forces, to joyn with them. Whilst they remain'd in this post, the parties which they sent abroad had taken several prisoners; by whom they were inform'd, that Major General Smith was advancing from Zatmar, with a considerable Body of the Imperial Army, much stronger than that of the Poles, and that he march'd with Cannon; upon this Intelligence Boham call'd a Council of War, at which it was agreed to re-pass the little River Battor, and the inclos'd Country adjacent, and to post themselves on a Ground of more ad∣vantage, that they might the sooner joyn with their own Troops not as yet come up, and also attend the Attack of the Enemy in a fast and a securer place. Two Polish Gentlemen Revolt.But before the Camp remov'd from Ni∣melsi, two Polish Gentlemen, with a Ser∣vant, revolted over to the Enemy; and inform'd Smith then at Zatmar, that the Polish Forces, together with the Tartars of Lipka were inconsiderable, very much ha∣rassed with a long March, and weaken'd with want of Food and Necessaries to su∣stain them; in which streightned Condition they were ready to Mutiny, and would soon change their side, in case Letters were wrote to some of the Chief of them, gi∣ving them assurance of good Quarter, and a kind Reception. Letters were accord∣ingly wrote, and dispatch'd by the Servant of the Polish Gentlemen who arriv'd the same Night at Nimelsi, where the Treache∣ry of the two Gentlemen was discover'd, and the Letters intercepted,Their Trea∣chery dis∣cover'd. and publickly read, the substance of which was this; That Smith had a strong Army well resolv'd, and provided of all things necessary, against which in all probability their Forces were not able to stand:The Sub∣stance of Smith's Letter to the Poles. That therefore they should in time provide for their own security and safe∣ty, by passing over to the Imperial Party, where they might assure themselves of a kind Reception, and a hearty Wellcome; and it would make their Merit much the greater, in case they would seize the Papers, Money and Plate of all the Officers, and particularly of the person of Uladislaus Wessellini, Son of the late Palatine of Hungary, and Nephew to the present General of the Malecontents. Farther advising such, that were thus well disposed, to bind Straw about their Caps, which should be a Signal at the beginning of the Fight of their good Intentions. And that Smith might give them security that these promises should be perform'd, he affix'd his Seal upon the Letter, with this Motto; Per hoc assicurantur Domini Poloni. No News being as yet come of Wessel∣lini,A Fight be∣tween the Imperia∣lists on one side, and the Poles, and Tartars, and Hun∣garians on the other. Boham had no sooner provided for his own security, and well posted his For∣ces, and put them in Battalia, before the Van-guard of the Enemy Charg'd the ad∣vanc'd Troops of the Poles so fiercely, that they put them to a Retreat, and wounded Koreski Colonel of the Tartars of Lipka; with which the Imperialists being encou∣rag'd, press'd the Hungarians and Tartars with such fierceness and vigor, that the Tartars began to give ground and fly; and were pursu'd by some Troops of swift Croats, who knew very well in what man∣ner to make use of such advantages, kil∣ling many, and taking some Prisoners. In the mean time Smith made such hast to come in to the succor of his advanc'd Troops, that he left all his Infantry some Leagues behind, and March'd in the Front of 20 Squadrons of Horse, much more strong and numerous than the Poles; Te∣stifying by his Countenance the great as∣surance he had of Victory. But when he was come near, and had receiv'd the fire from a Regiment of Dragoons Commanded by Major Zefold, and drawn up amongst the Bushes on the right hand of the Line; and observ'd the good Order and Resolu∣tion of the Poles, he began then to be sen∣sible of his temerity, and the Snare into which he was drawn, by the false Report of the two Fugitives. The Hungarians and Tartars which were newly put to flight by the Vanguard of the Enemy,Th Tartars Rally. seeing at a distance the valour of their Companions, rallied again, and Charg'd with new Courage: so that the Imperialists being astonish d and dismay'd by the Clouds of Arrows, the continual
Fire from the Infantry and Dragoons, and the redoubled Blows of the Cut-lashes and Scimitars, and the Multitudes of their dead Companions which covered the Field with their Bodies,The Impe∣rialists o∣verthrown. began to give ground, and breaking in one upon the other, betook themselves to Flight in the most confused, and shameful manner that can be imagin'd, and were pursued by the Enemy near two Leagues from the Field where the Battle was Fought. The number of those Slain were a Thou∣sand, besides those, who endeavouring to save their Lives by Swimming were Drown'd in the River. The Officers Slain were Count Hermestin, Colonel of Foot, and Governour of Zatmar, Colalto Colonel of the Croats, besides many other Captains and Officers of Foot, whom Smith had perswaded to leave their Companies, and attend him in this Enterprise, in which he judged himself most secure of Victory. Smith himself was wounded in the Hand, and was forc'd to quit his Horse to save his Life, which was after∣wards the prize of a Tartar, with the Saddle, Holsters and Hoosings embroider'd with Gold. The Poles took four Kettle-Drumms, and the greatest part of their Trumpets, with all their Colours, and 800 Prisoners: And had not the night favour'd them, very few had escaped. The praises of Boham and other Officers.On this occasion Boham Signalized himself very greatly, and evidenced unto the World by his Valour and Conduct, how much he deserved the chief Command of those Troops: And indeed, all the Officers, as well Tartars as others, behaved themselves like Soldiers and able Commanders: But Major General Smith, tho' inferiour to none in any thing which appertains to Martial Exercise; yet being betray'd by his own Credulity, was blam'd much at Vienna for his Rashness and Precipitation. After this Success, Boham having Refresh'd for two days his Forces in the Field where the Bat∣tle was Fought, repassed the River of Bat∣tor, and the Inclosures, and joyned the Army of the Malecontents, which was 16000 strong,The Poles and Male∣contents joyn. under the Command of Count Wessellini: So that now being a formidable Army, the Chief Officers at a Council of War agreed to Besige Tokai; to prevent which General Kops, upon advice of the Enemies Motion, departed from Caschau with the Imperial Army, intending to At∣tack the Enemy with the first Advantage: Which Wessellini avoided until he had first secur'd a place of Retreat in case of any Sinister fortune or disgrace: But Howsoe∣ver, sending Parties abroad, they Burnt and Plunder'd seven Villages near to Mongatz; and in regard the Imperial Army was marched at some distance from Caschau, adventur'd to Burn several Villages also near to that Town; and had the Fortune to intercept a Convoy which carried both Money,A Convoy with Money and Pro∣visions ta∣ken by the Malecon∣tents 1500 of the Imperialists revolt to the Enemy. Victuals and Ammunition from Vienna, for Payment and Maintenance of the Army under General Kops. This loss of Money and Provisions pro∣ved of ill Consequence to the Emperor's Army, which wanting Pay and necessaries for subsistence, many of them, to the num∣ber of 1500, upon the Promises of Wessel∣lini to bestow on every Officer 26 Ducats, with a command agreeable to his quality, and 10 to every private Soldier, who should relinquish the Emperor's Service, were ea∣sily induced to Revolt, and take up Arms in favour of the Malecontents. Kops being highly incensed hereat, resolved on a quite contrary method of Action, supposing that he might effect the same with Rigour and Cruelty,Kops his Cruelty. which the Enemy had done by Allurements and Rewards; and that it was possible to terrifie, and affrighten the con∣trary party into their Duty and Obedience: Wherefore, to make an experiment hereof, he killed all the Prisoners he had in his hands, and empal'd several others: This piece of Cruelty against the Law of War and Nations, was in like manner retaliated by Wessellini; who put the Prisoners to death, to the number of Sixty, which the Po∣landers had taken in the late Battle, together with Lieutenant Colonels, Majors and Captains, which occasioned great Destur∣bances, and Murmurings in the Imperial Army:For which he his bla∣med at Vienna. And at Vienna this Conduct of Kops was highly blam'd, and Orders sent him never more to exercise the like unhu∣mane Practices; for that many Officers of good Note and Reputation, had abso∣lutely refused to serve the Emperor in a War, where no Quarter was to be ex∣pected. About this time, Smith with his shatter'd Troops joyn'd with General Kops near to Butrack; two Leagues from whence the Malecontents were Encamped, and Rein∣forc'd by 2000 Transilvanians, conducted thither by Count Tekeli,Count Te∣keli ap∣pears in the War. who after the death of his Father (as before mention'd) had served Prince Apafi in the nature of his Secretary, or one who had a chief hand in the management of his Affairs; and now making this first entrance on the Stage, we shall have occasion to mention him often hereafter, being the Person who is to make the greatest Figure in this following Hi∣story, and to prove the most active Gene∣ral, after the destruction of many before him, and after various Successes, of good and bad Fortune, and Honours and Di races received from the Turks; we shall sd him still Boyant and above Water, even at the
last extremity, when the Turks themselves were beaten out of all Hungary. The Imperial Army having been much diminish'd in numbers by the Sword and Sickness, was again in part recruited by some Additional Forces, under the Com∣mand of Count Warbenoren, and by 600 Men out of a Regiment in Silesia: Howso∣ever, such was the Misfortunes of those Times, and the inauspicious Stars which then reign'd, that the Imperialists were worsted in all Fights and Skirmishes, to the destruction almost of their whole Army: Whilest the Forces of the Malecontents in∣creased double to the numbers of the Em∣perors Army.The Male∣contents increase in their For∣ces. And the Turks still forward∣ed these Mischiefs by their frequent Incur∣sions from Buda, Newhawsel, and all their Garrisons; which was a Course and Practice which this Faithless People used, to make War without declaring it. ANNO 1678. The Empe∣ror sends to treat with the Malecon∣tents, and with the Turks.The Emperor being sensible of his own weak and decaying Condition, and of the Strength, and increasing Power of his mighty Enemies, labour'd to cure and re∣medy the imminent evils and dangers by Treaties, which could not be done by Arms: And in order thereunto he offer'd three Churches to the Malecontents in the Upper Hungary, with other Propositions more large, and extensive than formerly: And Hoffman, the principal Secretay of State and War, was sent to the Grand Seignior to make Complaints of the Succours, which the Pashas of Hungary daily afforded to his Rebellious Subjects: But neither the one, nor the other of these Negotiations, had the success desired: For the Malecon∣tents were so far from hearkening to any Accommodation with their Sovereign Prince, that they were contriving the manner, how they might absolutely throw off his Autho∣rity, and acquit themselves of their Allegi∣ance:The Male∣contents propose to Elect a King of their own. And to that end, they proposed to Elect a King of their own Nation, and many cast their Eyes upon a certain Count, who was of the House and Family of Frangipani: But the different Interests, and variety of Opinions, obstructed the Election, so that nothing was agrreed, or concluded in that affair. Nor could much more be expected from the Negotiations of Hoffman at Con∣stanstinople; for the Vizier was so extrava∣gant in his Demands, and so unreasonable in his Proposals, that it plainly appear'd, how far he was from any intentions of re∣newing the Peace, or any other designs than that of War. Only by force of the rich Presents which Hoffman brought, he prevailed with the Vizier to strangle the Pasha of Waradin. Howsoever, things ran not so smoothly in Transilvania, nor with the Malecon∣tents, but that they met with other difficul∣ties and Enemies, besides the Emperor. For a certain Person,Pedipol procures a Commission to be Prince of Transil∣vania. a Boyar of that Coun∣try named Pedipol, being ambitious of Go∣vernment, offer'd Money to the Grand Vi∣zier for the Principality of Transilvania, alledging that Apafi had Ruled there much beyond the time of other Princes: The Vizier, whose business was Gain, enter'd into a Treaty with Pedipol, made the bar∣gain, took his Money and sold him the Principality; and procur'd the Grand Seig∣niors Hattesheriff, or Royal Signature to constitute him Prince, and to divest, or de∣pose Apafi. When Pedipol came with this Authority to take Possession of the Govern∣ment, the People refused to receive him, and Apafi to Surrender:He is oppo∣sed by Apa∣fi and o∣vercome. Whereupon Pedi∣pol with his Party endeavoured to make good his Title, and Establishment by Force of Arms. The Vizier upon the news here∣of, to prevent those Divisions, dispatched an Officer into Transilvania to decide the Difference, by taking off the Head of that Person, who should be found disobedient and averse to the Grand Seignior's Com∣mands: But before this Order could arrive, the dispute was determin'd by the Fortune of War; for the Malecontents being sensi∣ble of the Obligations they had to Apafi, and of what concernment his continuance in that Station would prove to them, of∣fered him all the aid and assistance they were able, to which the Poles likewise joyn∣ing their Forces, over-threw Pedipol in the Field, and caused him with some of his Ad∣herents to Fly into Valachia: Where raising new Forces, he marched again towards Transilvania, with intention to make a second Attempt: But being met in his way by the Pasha of Waradin, he was command∣ed by him in the Grand Seigniors name, to quit his Pretentions to the Principality, and to content himself in a private Condi∣tion: For the Vizier having got his Money, little cared what became of Pedipol, whe∣ther he were a Prince or Paisant; only he thought it necessary at that time to con∣serve Peace between the Friends, and Allies to the Port, which was more easily done by supporting the interest of Apafi, who was old and experienced in that Government, ra∣ther than by setting up Pedipol, whose Cir∣cumstances were very disagreeable, both to the Transilvanians and the Malecon∣tents. Howsoever, these differences contributed little to better the Condition of the Empe∣ror, who of late had been worsted in all the Conflicts, and Engagements against the Enemy▪ As for Instance, a Party of
Five hundred Horse, under the Command of Azos Benas,The Empe∣ror's ill Successes. being advanc'd as far as Erlaw, belonging to the Lands and De∣mesnes of Count Tekeli, were assail'd by the Turks, and their whole Body defeated, and cut in pieces. Another Party also consisting of two hundred Men, Command∣ed by Colonel Wolping, were overthrown by a Detachment of Turks belonging to Newhawsel. Represent∣ments of the Assem∣bly at Al∣tembourg.These ill Successes in War, inclin'd the States of Hungary, then Assembled at Oe∣dembourg, to consent that all the Churches taken from the Protestants, should with many other advantageous Propositions be consigned and granted to them. And ano∣ther Assembly at Altembourg did represent unto the Emperor, that the Change made in the Government of Hungary, was the cause of all the late Troubles and Wars in that Kingdom; to appease which, they were of Opinion that it was absolutely ne∣cessary to re-establish the Charge and Of∣fice of Palatine, according to the Ancient constitution of that Nation; and that a General Diet should be conven'd to that purpose. But when the Imperial Ministers of State, as well Ecclesiastick as Civil, came to Debate upon these Points, they offer'd many Qualifications:The Empe∣ror's Coun∣cil qualifie them. As that the the Authority of Palatine should be limi∣ted, and restrain'd: That the Emperor's Writs or Letters should be Imperative, ra∣ther than Mandative; that is, that they should be penn'd in such a Stile, as that they might appear rather Assertive of the Absolute and Imperial Power, than to con∣descend unto more moderate Terms anci∣ently us'd in that Kingdom. And when they came to the Article about restitution of the Churches (which was the main point on which the Malecontents insisted) they Treated with such Niceties, and with so many Provisoes and Savings, that the De∣puties believ'd that the Imperial Ministers came to speak for Colours, and Subterfu∣ges, to evade and illude an Accommodation, rather than with true and sincere affections to heal the breaches, and compose the dif∣ferences of the Nation. Wessellini his death.Whilst these Matters were in Negotia∣tion, Count Paul Wessellini, who was Bro∣ther to the late Palatine, and General of the Malecontents, died, and then the Com∣mand of the Army was committed to Count Tekeli;Is succeeded by Tekeli. who (as we have said) had gain'd such great Reputation in the Court of Prince Apafi, that he made him his princi∣pal Minister of State; and tho' he was a young Man, of about twenty four or twenty five years of Age, yet he so distin∣guish'd himself by his Valour, Prudence, and Industry, that the eyes of all Hungary were upon him, as a Person in every re∣spect agreeable to the present great Under∣takings. Tekeli being now at the head of twelve thousand Fighting Men, well appointed, and fitted with all Necessaries, and a Train of Artillery of about twelve pieces of Can∣non, and four Mortars, look'd on himself as in a Condition to undertake some great Enterprize.Tekeli's first designs. And having joyn'd with the Forces of his Cousin Count Tekeli, and supply'd himself with some of the Empe∣ror's Money out of the Mint at Nagibania, he held a Council of War, and propos'd to Besiege either Caschau, or Kalo. Howsoever,He is in Love with the Princess Ragotski. the Inclinations he had for the Daughter of Count Serini, Widow of the late Prince Ragotski, directed him in the first place towards Mongatz, that he might (if possible) come to a sight of that Lady for whom he had so great a passion. But upon the approach of these Troops, her Mother-in-Law, who was zealous for the Interest of the Emperor, gave Orders to the Forces which were rais'd within her State, to fall upon Tekeli,Tekeli de∣feats the Troops of the Prin∣cess Ra∣gotski Dowager. whose Quar∣ters were not far distant from Mongatz. The Fight was bravely maintain'd on both sides; till at length the Troops of the Princess were forc'd to give way, and 200 of them being slain on the place, and many Prisoners taken (amongst which the Count Serini was one) the rest were put to flight, being entirely defeated. With these Successes the Army of the Malecontents daily increas'd; to which an additional Force of eight or nine thousand Tartars be∣ing added, the Emperor thought it necessa∣ry to recruit his Army with a Regiment of Horse, under the Command of Count Stirum, and with some other Troops which were in Bohemia, and Stiria. And now to make it appear that God had destin'd a War with the Turk, for Ends best known to his Divine Omnisci∣ence, a party of the Imperialists unadvi∣sedly fell upon the New Pasha,The Impe∣rialists fall on the Pa∣sha of Newhawsel. as he was going to his Government of Newhawsel, and defeated his whole Party, consisting of 200 Horse. Which Action, tho' pretended to have been done by way of Reprisal, or Revenge for something of the like nature perform'd by that Garrison; yet the Pasha of Buda highly resented this Breach of the Peace; threatning not only to acquaint the Grand Seignior therewith, but in the mean time to revenge the same by all the Acts of Hostility that he was able. And ac∣cordingly, drawing some Forces out of the Garrisons of Erlaw and Waradin, he caus'd them to March towards Sando, near Butrac,Is reveng'd by the Pa¦sha of Buda pillaging and plundring all in their way, and afterwards they return'd with

two hundred Prisoners. Which Action the Pasha of Buda own'd to have been done by his Special Order and Command, by way of reprisal, and satisfaction for the late Breach, and Act of Hostility. To which allegation, there being nothing which in reason or sense could be reply'd, Count Wourmb,Cont Wourmb blamed. who was General in those parts, was highly blam'd by the Emperor, and many Miscarriages of the like nature at∣tributed to his ill Conduct, and want of prudence, as if his Intentions had been to provoke the Turks unto a War. For which Reason, he was recall'd by the Emperor from that Employment, and Count Lesly sent to Command the Forces in his Place. The Emperor perceiving that he was ve∣ry unable to resist the Forces which were now in open Field, and in defiance against him, had his Recourse to the Old Project of making New Propositions, and Offers of Peace to the Malecontents. But this was always so unluckily managed, and with so ill a grace, that it was no wonder if it found no better Success. But now, as if it were intended to make things more plain and satisfactory to the World, with∣out Disputes, or Qualifications, a Manifesto was publish'd by the Emperor's Command,The Empe∣ror publishes a Manifest. Granting and Indulging unto all a General Act of Pardon and Oblivion, a Restoration to their Estates, a Free Exercise of Reli∣gion, and a Right and Privilege of being equally admitted into Places of Trust, and Offices of Court with the Germans, and others of the Roman Catholick Religion; provided that within the space of three Months they lay down their Arms, and sub∣mitted to the Clemency of his Imperial Majesty. And as to those who should still stand out, and obstinately persevere in their Rebellion, he requir'd the States of Hun∣gary, and all his Loving Subjects of that Kingdom, to joyn their Forces unto his, for the subjection of such Rebellious Persons, who were Enemies to himself, and to their own Country. But least these fair Offers should Ope∣rate any thing on the Minds of the Peo∣ple,Tekeli of∣fers new Aggrie∣vances. Tekeli at the same time, to make the Embroils more confused, sent a List to the Emperor of fresh Aggrievances, for which he desir'd some Remedies might be consider'd. All which the Emperor referr'd to the Exa∣mination of a Diet, which was suddenly to Assemble. And in Order thereunto, the General Baragotzi sent Passports to the Chief of the Malecontents,Passports given to meet at a Diet. that they might freely come to the Diet, and return without mole∣station; Insinuating unto them, that their Government by a Palatine should be restor'd, and whatsoever they could expect to gain by force of Arms, should now be more ea∣sily yielded, and granted by Covenants of an Amicable Agreement. But all these Hopes and Expectations were overthrown by the heats which arose between the Em∣peror's Ministers at Vienna, and the Depu∣ties appointed by the Malecontents to Treat and prepare Matters against the Meeting of a Diet. For one day,The Diet disappoint∣ed, and how. when the Differences were in debate, it happen'd that the Chancellor Oker unadvisedly said, That the Hungarian Nation had always been Faithless and Rebellious against their Prince. Which words being immediately catch'd at by the Great Chancellor of Hungary. It is unjust (said he) to Charge the Crime of some particular Persons on the whole Nation. To which Oker with more passion than be∣fore, made this Reply; That it would be happy for the Emperor, if one in twelve were found that truly and sincerely adher'd to his interest. At these words, Count Palfi the Treasurer of Hungary, not being able to contain himself longer, burst out into a passion, and call'd the Chancellor Traytor, Knave, and Rascal. And Count Harcani, another of the Deputies, as Gouty as he was, made a shift to get upon his Legs, and perswade his Companions to break up the Assembly and be gone, to avoid the noise of such Ribaldry, and affrontive Lan∣guage. And as they were going out of the Room, the Chancellor of Hungary, and Count Forgatz added, Know (said they) that we have never betray'd our King, nor pleaded for our Kindred, who were found guil∣ty of base and perfidious Actions. Consider that we have not forgot how far you Coun∣tenanc'd the Governour of Freibourg. To all which Oker made no Reply, but re∣turn'd to the Emperor, to give him an ac∣count of what had pass'd at this Confe∣rence. In the mean time Tekeli thinking of nothing less than Peace,The Pro∣ceeding and Actions of Tekeli. or means of Ac∣commodation, burnt the Suburbs of Casso∣via; and having receiv'd a Recruit of four hundred Horse, which the Brother of Ba∣ragotzi, who Revolted to his Party, had brought over to him, he seiz'd on the Ci∣tadel of Zeilaverd, where were found six∣teen pieces of Ordnance. He then design∣ing to pass the River of Tourna, to re-take the Fortress so call'd, which the Enemy had lately gain'd, he found the Passage ob∣structed by a Party of the Imperialists on the other side; but bringing four pieces of Cannon to play on the Enemy, they clear'd the way, and kept them at a di∣stance; by which means a Regiment of the Poles first passed, and after them the whole Army. Thus Fortune favouring the Malecontents, a hundred Soldiers of the
Imperial Troops revolted over on this Oc∣casion to the Enemy,Some of the Imperia∣lists revolt. such prevalence hath Success always on the Minds of Mankind; the which facilitated also the taking of Tourna, which was Surrender'd at discre∣tion. After this, Tekeli March'd towards Chiacatorno, and in his way he took Zere∣netz, and Melkasso, which yielded also at discretion, without any resistance; but Podrach standing out was taken by force, and all the Garrison put to the Sword, except some Officers, who were conserv'd, and made Prisoners of War. Tekeli Ma∣ster of the Field.Whilst these Successes attended the Male∣contents, Tekeli remain'd Master of the Field; so that the Count de Wourmb neither durst remove his Encampment from before Esperies, nor Count Lesley adventure on a March to joyn with him; until Tekeli re∣moving from those parts towards Strigo∣nium, and to make himself Master of Leventz, the Imperial Forces found an opportunity to March as far as the River of Waagh, where they joyn'd with the Regiments of Dunewald, Holstein, Massigni, Caraffa, and Strazoldo, which came lately out of Silesia; and tho' these Forces were joyn'd together, with those also of Count Lesley, yet they were not sufficient to withstand the Army of Count Tekeli, which consisted of at least twenty thousand effective Men, besides Garrisons, and several Detatchments. Tekeli writes Letters.Tekeli being thus strong, and having made himself Master of Leventz, Wrote circulary Letters in his own Name to all the Inhabi∣tants of that Country: Representing before them the ill Treatment, which all Hungary had received from the Germans, and the Slavery they lay under by a Foreign Yoak. That he was resolved with the chief of his Party, to defend the Liberties and Privi∣leges of Hungary with his Life and Estate: Exhorting all others to joyn with him in this good Cause; and Threatning such, who either out of Cowardize, or Coldness to∣wards the wellfare of their Country, or favour to the Emperor, should place them∣selves in the Condition of a careless Neu∣trality. No sooner had Count Wourmb raised his Camp from before Esperies, to joyn with the Silesian Troops;Tekeli takes Es∣peries, and Arva. but Tekeli observing his motion Invested the place, and took it in three days: The like he did to the Castle of Arva, which Surrendred even in the sight of Count Lesley, his Forces not being sufficient to give assistance or relief thereunto. At this time Wessellini falling Sick and Dying, the Command of the Hungarian Troops was given to Tekeli; Boham was Chief of the Auxiliaries, and Tekeli himself Genera∣lissimo of all; so that the whole management of the War, was now in the Hands of these three Leaders. The Tartars as Flying, and Independant Troops acted by themselves;The Tar∣tars Plun∣der, and Burn. they pillaged Newstadt, and burnt all the Country round within three Leagues of Leopolstadt; and afterwards made their Pas∣sage over the River Waagh near Trenschin, which the Counts Forgatz and Esterhasi be∣ing not able to oppose, the People of Mo∣ravia were so affrighted, that taking what Goods with them they could, in so suddain and distracted a fear, they fled to the Mountains for refuge. Boham and Tekeli understanding that Count Lesley was quarter'd near to Zatmar, they marched to Attack him; which when Lesley understood,Count Lesley ove∣thrown. he divided his Troops into three Bodies, with a seeming resolu∣tion to Engage the Enemy; but so soon as they came near, they show'd some signs of Irresolution, and a desire as it were to make a handsome Retreat: But being pursued by Tekeli with six Battalions, he engaged them near Leutsch, and Killed, or made Prison∣ers the greatest part of that Body. Boham in the mean time totally defeated another Party, of which Four hundred Horse only escaped. The third Body saved themselves in the Mountains, and other fast places. After this Victory Tekeli sent a Detach∣ment of his Forces to joyn with the Tar∣tars in Moravia, who took Barin,Tartars in Moravia. the capi∣tal City thereof; which gave an Alarm to all the Hereditary Countries: And at the same time one Colonel Josua, otherwise call'd Father Joseph, who had been a Friar, but now turn'd Protestant, and a Soldier, such another kind of a daring Fellow as Duke John before mention'd,Duke John. joyn'd with the Male∣contents, and enter'd Austria with Six thousand Fighting Men, raised at his own Charge, which put all those Countries into such a Consternation, that the People aban∣doned their Towns, and Villages and fled unto Vienna, for their place of Refuge. The courage and experience of this Colo∣nel Josua,Colonel Jo∣sua. was so well known to the Arch-Bishop of Strigoniam, that he perswaded the Emperor, to take him off from the Malecontents, and engage him by Promi∣ses of reward to his own Party: This Office was committed to the Management and Conduct of Count de Wourmb, because Count Lesley remain'd Sick at Cassovia; but such was the constancy of this Martial Friar to his Cause and Principles, that no∣thing could avail with him to change his Party: Suspecting perhaps, that when once the Arch-Bishop should get him into his Power, he would immure him within the Walls of his Convent, and oblige him to the performance of his Vow: But he re∣jected all the offers, which were made him,
and reserved himself for greater Exploits, which happened the year following. Such is the fury of Civil Wars, much more active and violent than Foreign, that few days passed without Fights, or Skir∣mishes in one place or other. Count Wourmb, having received all the Recruits that he could expect, marched directly towards Tekeli and Boham,A Fight near Alsol. and engaged with them early in the Morning, in a Fight which con∣tinued until three a Clock in the Afternoon, with such equal Fortune, that the Male∣contents being sensible of the valour, and resolution of the Imperialists retreated with good order under the Cannon of Alsol, a Town Situate on the River of Gran, be∣tween Newsol and Kremnitz. In the mean time twenty Squadrons of the Rebels endea∣vouring to pass the Mountains, were repulsed by Colonel Reyters, who at the Head of his Regiment defended the Passages, and drove them back to their Camp, having killed Five hundred of them on the place. But this loss was the next day revenged by Tekeli, who took Bistrick by force of Arms, with much Blood and Slaughter of the In∣habitants.Bistrick taken. This Bistrick is a Town Si∣tuate in a Plain, encompass'd about with little Hills, famous for the golden Mines, and the Country well planted about it with pleasant Vineyards; the Governours thereof would neither declare themselves at first either for the Emperor, or for the Malecontents: But when the Imperialists with their Army drew near to them, they could no longer conceal their Affecti∣ons, and good Wishes, but broke their Neu∣trality, and declar'd for the Emperor: Soon after which Tekeli making himself Master of the place, put six of the Chief Inhabitants to death, in punishment of their Infidelity, and breach of Promise. But before the end of this year, the Im∣perialists had their changes of good For∣tune, as well as the Malecontents, a Party of which the Garrison of Filek entirely defeated:Filek. Filek is Situate in the Road-way from the Mountain Towns in Hungary lea∣ding to Transilvania and Cassovia, and lies about five Leagues Northward from Agria. This Success was seconded by another Rout, which Count Esterhasi the Pope's General gave to a party of Five hundred Spahees,Esterhasi defeats a Body of the Turks. and Two thousand Janisaries near Vesprin, who were design'd to make Incursions in∣to the Emperor's Countries. But least this Action should be ill represented to the Grand Seignior, and become the Cause of a Rupture, the Emperor dispatched away an Express to Constantinople, to give a true account of the Cause, and Reasons for this Engagement. And now being come to that Season of the year, when Armies draw in∣to their Winter-quarters. Both Parties be∣ing in cooler temper began to Treat; so that a Cessation of Arms was agreed,A Cessation of Arms, and a Treaty. and the place appointed for the Conference was Oedembourg, where all the Chief Lords of Hungary had agreed to Assemble. The per∣son who was to preside for the Emperor, was the Prince of Swartzembourg, and Count de Nostiz manag'd the Treaty, applying himself with much Zeal and Diligence that this Negotiation might be happily con∣cluded. ANNO 1679. This Treaty with a Cessation of Arms continu'd till the end of the year, with hopes that the beginning of the next would make that poor Kingdom happy with a Peace. But the Emperor having as it were secur'd a Peace with France (which was one of the greatest fears he had upon him,The Empe∣ror falls off from his former Of∣fers. in case of a War with the Turks) re∣fus'd to yield unto the same terms which he had frequently offer'd in former times to the Malecontents. It was now resolv'd that the Office of Palatine should for ever hereafter be extinguish'd and made void,  and that Kingdom govern'd by a Vice-Roy, who was solely to be constituted by Com∣mission from the Emperor. 2dly, The Pro∣testants were not to have Churches in Towns or Cities, but to content themselves with such as should be allotted them in Villages. 3dly, As a Preliminary to all the rest, the Malecontents were to dismiss the Foreign Troops entertain'd in their Service, before the Treaty upon any other Conditi∣ons and Articles should commence. The very noise of this alteration in the Empe∣ror's Councils,An end put to the Truce. put a stop to all proceed∣ings of a Treaty, and an end to the Truce and Cessation of Arms. And indeed the Malecontents were by this time so engag'd with the Turks, that on their part also they had put themselves out of all possibility of Accommodation without their concurrence, and concernment in the Treaty. The Assembly at Oedembourg being dis∣solv'd,A Diet at Coloswar. the Malecontents held a Diet of their own at Coloswar, alias Claudiopolis, whereunto Prince Apafi, and the Neigh∣bouring Pashas resorted, to treat and agree upon the measures which were to be taken for the ensuing year, in order to carrying on the War. Whilst they were upon this Treaty, a Messenger arriv'd from the Grand Seignior, who brought a Scymitar to Prince Apafi, which was a certain Signal of the Sultan's favour, and acceptance of his Services, which was much to the joy of all Persons there present; for that it was doubtful before, how far the Grand Seig∣nior
would abott the Cause of Pedipol, to whom (as we have mention'd) he had gi∣ven his Commission to be Prince of Tran∣silvania, with exclusion of Apafi. Nor was the News of less concernment to them brought at the same time, that the Grand Seignior was upon conclusion of peace with the Moscovites,The Turks jyn with the Male∣contents. by which the whole Otto∣man Empire would be at leisure to employ all their Troops against the Germans. And with the same occasion the Pashas of Hun∣gary were Commanded to joyn with Apafi, and to assist the Malecontents with such Forces as they should desire; of all which the Emperor having certain Intelligence from his Resident at Constantinople, Order'd three Regiments to be sent into Hungary, for recruit of the Forces under Count Lesley, of which the Malecontents having Advice, took the Field, and passing the Theysse, pitch'd their Camp near Debrezin, to cover and relieve as occasion serv'd the Castle of Kovar.Debrezin. This City of Debrezin, or Debre∣chim is situated between Tokai, and great Waradin, and is very Rich and Populous. It was a Free Town, and conserv'd it self in a Neutrality during the late Revolutions; but after Zolnock and Cassovia were reduc'd, the Magistrates thereof desir'd his Imperial Majesty to take them under his protection; with which, and by payment of a Tribute to the Port, the Inhabitants liv'd quiet and free, until the year 1676. when it was taken by Count Strazoldo, upon pretence that it was become the place of Sanctuary and common Refuge of the Malecontents; tho' afterwards, upon complaints from the Turks, the Emperor withdrew his Forces from thence, leaving them free, and in their former Condition of Neutrality. In the mean time Tekeli falling in love with a Daughter of the Princess Ragotski Dowager, who was extreamly zealous (as we have mention'd before) for the Empe∣ror's Cause, refus'd to bestow her Daughter upon him, unless he would first Relinquish the Interest to which he had adher'd.Tekeli re∣volts to the Emperor. The passion which Tekeli had for the young Lady, was more powerful than his Inclina∣tions to the discontented Party; so that first seeming cold in his Old pursuits, and declaring his Mind freely in open Discourse, his Troops began to suspect his Fidelity, and left him, and put themselves under the Command of Wessellini. Tekeli endea∣vour'd to perswade Palfi Imbre to joyn with him in his Revolt; but not prevail∣ing, he singly with some few Servants went over to Vienna. Coming thus alone to the Emperor without his Troops he was the less welcome; and indeed he was so little regarded, and his Merit so ill accounted on, that when he made applications to the Emperor for Restitution of his Estate which was Confiscated to the value of two Mil∣lions, those who enjoy'd the benefit of so great Riches, obstructed his Request;Is slighted. Re∣presenting unto the Emperor, that the re∣turn to his Duty after a long continuance in Rebellion, only in his own Person, and without his Troops, deserv'd nothing, nor was it to be judg'd a satisfaction or an atonement for the many mischiefs and dis∣services that he had already done; and that to recover the Emperor's favour, there was something else to be done besides a bare surrender of his Person: Howsoever fair words were given him for some time; of which, and of tedious Addresses and frequent Applications,He returns again to the Rebels. Tekeli growing weary, he return'd to his Old Friends a∣gain, with whom he was receiv'd, and ad∣mitted to the Command of his deserted Troops. About the same time the young Count Serini, Son of Nicholas Serini, who was kill'd in Croatia, and not of Peter Serini who was Beheaded for High-Treason, being now of years able to bear Arms in Service of the Emperor; made his humble Petition that he might be restor'd to the Estate of his Father,Young Count Se∣rini re∣stor'd to his Estate. which was seiz'd and sequester'd by the Collectors of the Emperor's Revenue, for the Lands and Demesnes of Peter Serini the Unkle, whose Goods were confiscated for High-Treason. The which Request being consider'd in the Privy-Council, it was judg'd highly reasonable, and just that this young Count should be restor'd to his Estate, and so it was accordingly Ordered. Tekeli being now return'd to his former Command, that he might both assure his Associates of his Fidelity towards them, and reproach the Imperialists for so lightly esteeming a Person that was able to serve them,Tekeli takes Kremnitz. he surpriz'd Kremnitz with three hundred Men under his Command, and ruin'd and burnt all the Works and Store-Houses belonging to the Silver-Mines, which with much Charge had been erected by the Emperor; and afterwards retir'd in∣to the Turkish Dominions. Count Strazoldo having receiv'd Intelli∣gence that Colonel Josua was advanc'd with eighteen hundred Men, to ruine certain Powder-Mills, pursu'd after him with four thousand Horse; and had the fortune to attack him,A Fight between Count Stra∣zold, and Colonel Josua. just at the time that he was thinking to draw off. Howso∣ever Josua according to his usual Bravery Charg'd the Enemy, and Disputed the Fight for several hours; until at length ha∣ving his Horse kill'd under him, he was forc'd to retreat, which he did in good Order; being again re-mounted, tho' he
was much incommoded by a Wound which he had receiv'd in this Engagement. Col. Josua revenges himself.But soon after this loss, Colonel Josua to revenge himself, taking the Opportunity whilst General Dunewald (who Commanded in the Place of Count Lesley, then lying Sick at Cassovia) was in his Quarters, surpriz'd two hundred Men belonging to those Recruits which were brought out of Silesia, and cut them to pieces, allowing Quarter unto none, but only to a Lieute∣nant, and four other Officers. Thus when the Imperialists observ'd the ill Successes which daily for the most part attended the War, they began again to change their Measures, and to esteem Peace much more eligible than an unfortu∣nate War. And notwithstanding the late refusal to grant any thing that was former∣ly offer'd; the Emperor was resolv'd now to condescend unto any thing that the Malecontents should demand,The Empe¦ror makes new Offers to the Male∣contents. and that no heavier burdens should be laid upon them, than such Taxes and Duties only as were imposed on the Subjects of his Hereditary Countries. Count Lesley being recover'd of his Indisposition, found an Opportunity to Discourse these Matters Personally with Colonel Josua; and so affected him with the Justice and Reasonableness of the Pro∣positions; that being absolutely convinc'd how much a Peace made on such Conditions, was to be preferr'd before a War in Conjuncton with the Turks;Col. Josua falls off to the Empe∣ror. he Wrote unto Tekeli, sig∣nifying his full and entire satisfaction in what was offer'd by the Emperor, and that those Conditions were a sufficient ground for a secure and a lasting Peace. But the Answer hereunto was retarded, by reason of a Plague which beginning to rage at Vienna,A Plague at Vienna. caus'd the Imperial Court to re∣move thence with much fear and hast unto Prague; and the Negotiation being then laid aside for some Months afterwards, time had so alter'd the state of things, that neither the Emperor was willing to stand to the former Offers, nor the Malecontents to receive them. Howsoever Colonel Jo∣sua remain'd firm and fix'd to his point; and upon a Pardon granted to him in am∣ple form and manner, he took a New Oath of Fidelity to the Emperor, and engag'd his own Troops to follow him in his Du∣tiful Allegiance;Col. Josua gives Testi∣monies of his Loyalty and that he might give some undoubted Testimonies of his true Conversion, by some Acts of Loyalty and Bravery, he perswaded Semey the Gover∣nour of Tourna to Surrender up the Castle, and adhere unto the Cause and Interest of the Emperor. And afterwards Enterprizing farther with a Party of his own Horse, he unfortunately fell into an Ambuscade, which a Famous Officer of Tekeli's had pre∣par'd for him. After which, escaping to a small Fortress not far from thence, he de∣fended himself therein for the space of two days; and being not able longer to main∣tain the place, he with much boldness set fire to the Powder, and blew himself up,His death. with all thereunto belonging. And thus this Valiant one ended his days; whose Humor was much more agreeable to a Soldier than a Friar, and better fitted for a Camp than a Monastery. Nor did the Pestilence only Rage within the Emperor's Dominions,A Plague at New∣hawsel. but the Infection dispersed it self with such violence and rage within the Territories of the Turks, that five hundred Families fled out of New∣hawsel, to breath in a more free and health∣ful Air; but scarce were they remov'd a League from the Garrison, before they were surpriz'd by a party of five hundred Hussars and Heydukes, who kill'd some of them,The People forsake the Town, and are cut off. and pillag'd and robbed the others of all the Goods and Monies which remain'd to them for a poor support, and maintenance of Life. Such was the unhappy State of that mise∣rable Kingdom, where Men could neither be secure within the Walls of their fortified Towns, nor permitted to breath in the open air of the Country; but whilst they fly from the Judgments of God, they fall into the cruel hands of merciless Men.The Poles and Mosco∣vites send an Embassie to the Em∣peror. And yet notwithstanding these daily pro∣vocations given the Turk (I know not by what Fate) the Emperor was of Opinion, that it was still possible so to salve up Mat∣ters with the Grand Seignior, that a War might be avoided. Upon which Opinion and Conceit so deeply rooted and fix'd in the Imperial Councils, the Emperor re∣fus'd to joyn with the Moscovites and Poles in a League offensive and defensive against the Common Enemy. There had been of late a great talk in the World of a Peace concluding between the Turks, and the Moscovites,The Mosco∣vites send an Ambas∣sador into Poland, grounded upon an Embassie which the latter had dis∣patch'd to Constantinople; when at the same time another Ambassador was sent by them into Poland, and there Treating with that King to enter into a League offensive and defensive with them; offering to defray a great part of the Charge of the War, pro∣vided that the Armies of the two Nations might joyn and act together in the next Campaign. The Poles neither seem'd to accept nor refuse the Offer, but referr'd the Agreement and Conclusion to the ensuing Diet.And ano∣ther Am∣bassador to Constanti∣nople. In the mean time another Ambassa∣dor of theirs arriv'd at the Port, to try and discover the intentions of the Turk towards them. The Grand Vizier, who had al∣ready been advis'd of their Embassies, dis∣patched into Poland, and Germany; was
desirous to discover the substance and in∣tent of the Message before he would ad∣mit the Ambassador to his Audience; to get a knowledge whereof, he employ'd some Grave Kaloires or Greek Monks (for whom he knew the Moscovites had great reverence and respect) to fish out if possible the meaning and purport of the Commission;Their Ne∣gotiations with the Turk. but the Ambassador kept his Business se∣cret, and with some Indignation told the Kaloires that the Embassie from the Czar his Master was not to them, but to the Grand Seignior; and that the substance of his Business was contain'd in the Letter, which he hop'd to present unto the Sultan with his own hands. When the Letter was opened, and read, the Contents there∣of was to this purpose. That the Great Czar of Moscovie did offer to make Peace with the Grand Seignior, provided that the Turks would Surrender Czechrim unto him, with all the other Places in the Ukraine, which the last year they had taken from him. Thus had the Moscovites three Treaties on foot at the same time; one with the Turk for Establishment of a Peace; and in case of such failure, then they propos'd to provide themselves with two such strong Allies, as the Emperor of Germany, and the King of Poland. Such was the Policy of this Northern People. ANNO, 1680. Treaties be∣tween Turks, Poles, and Moscovites.The greatest part of this Year passed in Treaties and Negotiations between the Poles, the Moscovites, and the Turks; none of the three remain'd in perfect good un∣derstanding with each other. The Poles had not as yet ratify'd their Peace with the Turk, having according to their usual Custom deferr'd it to the determination of a Diet, which was purposely delay'd, un∣til it appear'd how Matters would suc∣ceed in Hungary. The Moscovites enter∣tain'd a Treaty with the Poles, proposing a League Offensive and Defensive with them, with design to create a Jealousie in the Turk; in expectation thereby to Con∣clude their Peace on better Terms; and when they found the Turks inclining and condescending towards them, they then seem'd cold towards the Poles, and more remiss and indifferent in their Negotiations with them. The Turks likewise play'd their Game between both these Parties; not determining with which to close, because Matters did not in all Points agree with their expectations. The Moscovites acted doubly, and with reserve, but the Poles were more open and free in their Propo∣sals, and Action; they were sensibly touch'd with the loss of Caminieck, which was the Fortress and Bulwark to their Kingdom. Nor were the Dependances or Country thereunto belonging as yet set out or limitted, which were at present as large and extensive as the Turks were plea∣sed to make and assign them; they were Judges in their own Cause, and had power sufficient in their own hands to make good whatsoever they should determine. The Poles during these Negotiations,The Mosco∣vites make a Peace with the Poles. Treated with the Sword in their hands, and prepar'd for War; and so far press'd the League with Moscovy, that in fine it was concluded, which had been a great security for Poland, in case the Moscovites had kept their Faith with any regard, and respect to their League so lately agreed. But whilst Couriers with Dispatches pas∣sed and repassed between the Courts of Poland and Moscovy, the Turks having got notice of this Negotiation, presently made such Offers to the Moscovite Ambassador residing at Constantinople, that the Terms were accepted,They fall off from it, and agree with the Turk. and a Peace clap'd up be∣tween the Czar, and the Grand Seignior, which might have tended to the utter ru∣ine of Poland, had not the Design against Hungary (which the Turks had meditated for a long time) diverted the storm and fury of a War so much expected and dreaded by them. Nor was the Moscovite Ambassador in Poland much out of Coun∣tenance, when he was reproach'd with the breach of Faith; for that Nation was ne∣ver esteem'd in the World to have been easily touch'd with a tender sense of Ho∣nour, or scruples of those Matters which are call'd Faith, or Honesty; but rather have made such inconsiderable Trifles as those to become subservient to their greater interest and advantages. But lest the Turks should repent them of the Bargain they had made, and strike up with the Poles, who had just reason to leave the Moscovites in the lurch,An Am∣bassador sent to ra∣tifie the Peace. the Czar dis-speeded with all hast an Ambassador Extraordinary to the Port, together with the usual Presents; such as two thousand Sable Skins, twelve Hawks, and other Cu∣riosities; signifying by his Letters, that his aim and intention of that Embassie, was only to ratifie those Articles of Peace which were offer'd and agreed in a late Treaty. The Ambassador was receiv'd with such an unusual Wellcome, that he was surpriz'd at the strange Caresses which were shown him; which not only assur'd him that the former Conditions would most certainly be granted; but he wish'd his Master had given him Instructions to demand something of a higher and more
important Nature from the Turk. In short, when the Ambassador came to Treat upon Particulars,The Turks fall off from the Moscovites he found that this extravagant kindness was like the Embraces of a Strum∣pet, false and vain; and that the Turks were so far from an Agreement, that they would scarce grant or make good any one of those Propositions which they so lately promis'd; so the Ambassador was oblig'd to return as he came, without ease in any thing, unless of his Presents, of which the Turks took care to take off the burthen from him. With this piece of Policy had the Turks out-witted the Moscovites, and expos'd them to the disdain and reproach of the Poles; who could not very speedily be perswaded to believe that either their Faith or Friendship was worth the trouble of another League or Contract. Nor could the Moscovites, as dull and stupid as they are, have the face to offer at another Treaty with the Poles, which they had so lately rejected and violated for the sake of their false Friend. When the Ambassador was return'd to Mosco, he found all that City and Country in great Combustions, caus'd by the two Brothers contending for the Government, after the Death of the Czar their Father: But so soon as those Troubles were ap∣peas'd, by agreement of the Brothers to participate equally of the Sovereign Power, and joyntly to Rule,Other Ambassa∣dors sent from Mos∣co to the Port. they dispatch'd other Ambassadors to the Port with new Instru∣ctions. Where being arriv'd, their Presents were again kindly receiv'd, and their Per∣sons Treated in such a soft and gentle manner as the Turks commonly practise, when they intend to delay and protract the issue of an Affair to an uncertain time. For tho' the Turks were resolv'd to carry on the War in Hungary, yet the time was not fix'd when the same should be de∣nounc'd; the term thereof depending upon preparations and provisions of vast Sums of Money, and other Uncertainties necessary thereunto. And for that Reason the Mos∣covite Ambassador was still kept in hand, and detain'd at the Port. But in fine, when it was resolv'd that the War should be carry'd into Hungary, (which Resolution was first taken in the Year 1681.) then the Vizier concluded a Truce with the Moscovites for twenty Years, upon Conditions which the Czars sent by way of their Ambassador residing at the Court of the Tartar Chan, call'd Bau∣cha Sarai, whose chief Business there, was to Redeem and Exchange Prisoners; the which Letter directed to the Grand Vi∣zier, was to this effect. AT the instance of the Tartar Chan We have wrote to the Czars, that he would be pleas'd to grant you a Peace, as desir'd by you. In answer unto which, he hath given us to understand, that he will consent thereunto; provided, that besides Kiovia, you renounce all Title and Pre∣tence to Tripol, Staiki, and Vasikow, which have always been Dependences there∣upon. And that you farther promise, that your People shall not Inhabit, nor hold Fairs, Commerce, or Markets on our side of the Nieper; but that all that Country shall remain desert, and waste as it is at present. And that from the Towns of Tripol, Staiki, and Vasikow, to the Isles of the Cosacks Zoporoges, you renounce all your pretensions unto us. This is what we demand, and with∣out these terms we shall conclude nothing with you. The Vizier having resolv'd on a War against the Emperor,The Vizier accepts of the Condi∣tions offerd by the Mos∣covites. receiv'd these Pro∣positions with full satisfaction; and im∣mediately return'd Answer thereunto, in a Letter wrote to the Czars, full of their usual sublime Expressions, and of high and fulsom praises of their Wisdoms and Gran∣deur. Signifying that in the Name of the Grand Seignior he did accept and confirm all the Conditions propos'd; desiring him to send an Extraordinary Ambassador to confirm the Treaty. But lest the Czars should refuse to send a new Ambassador, before the other then residing was re∣turn'd; the Vizier about six Weeks after∣wards gave License for his Departure, and accompanied him with Presents of greater value, than those which the Grand Seig∣nior had formerly bestow'd upon the Czar. Of all these Particulars, Kaunitz, who Resided at Constantinople, in the Place of the Secretary Hoffman lately there De∣ceas'd, gave Intelligence to the Emperor; signifying also, that after the Moscovite Ambassador was arriv'd with Ratification of the Peace, the Grand Seignior would soon afterwards remove to Adrianople; in Order as was most probable, and in all appearance to a War against Hungary. This Matter was acted in the year 1681, which we have anticipated, that we might not abruptly break off the Treaty with Moscovy, the nature of which may be best understood, when it is carried forward in one Piece; which having done, we must look back again to the year 1680. and to the Actions of the Malecontents.
Tekeli was very active all this time in Recruiting his Army, and preparing for War; and having compos'd a Body of four thousand Transilvanians, he march'd with them to the General Rendezvous, intending as he had done the year before, to take upon him the Command of the Army. But when he came thither he was strangely surpriz'd to find the same refus'd to him by Count Wessellini, Son of the late Paul Wessellini deceas'd;Tekeli and Wessellini Fight for Command. who so resolutely contended for the Chief Command, that nothing could decide it but the Sword. In short, both Parties drew out into the Field, and charg'd each other; and after a long Dispute Tekeli got the Victory, and put Wessellini and his Forces to the Rout; and having pur∣su'd them with a Detachment of his For∣ces, the Competitor Wessellini was taken, and brought Prisoner to Tekeli; who causing him to be tied on his Horse, sent him to Prince Apafi in Transilvania; after which, Tekeli without a Rival took upon him the sole Command of the Army. The Emperor besides a War against his Rebel Subjects, was under great Mortifica∣tions, and Troubles; his Imperial Palace at Vienna was burnt, the Plague Rag'd violently in his Hereditary Countries, and in his Army,  of which the Baron de Kau∣nitz,The Pai∣sants in Bohemia rise in Arms. and other principal Officers died. And at the same time nine hundred Pai∣sants of the Circle of Braslaw in Bohemia arose in Arms against the Counts Galas, and Bredaw their Lords, pretending that they were treated like Slaves, and refus'd to pay the Contributions which were de∣manded for the Emperor. Howsoever, to make the Justice of their Cause appear, they sent four Deputies to Prague, to make known unto his Impe∣rial Majesty their many Aggrievances, which were so Tyrannical and Burthensom as could not longer be sustain'd; and there∣fore they desir'd that Council might be assign'd them to plead their Cause against their Lords at the Bar of Justice. But instead of hearkning to the Petition of these distressed Paisants, the Deputies were Imprison'd; and to stifle this Tumult in the beginning, two Regiments under the Command of Count Piccolomini were sent to reduce them; upon the appearance of which, the Mutineers dispers'd, and fled every Man to his own home. But this Combustion was not long suppress'd, before it burst forth again in a more violent and outragious manner than before; for four thousand of these dis∣contented Paisants were got together in a formidable Body, Conducted by several Reformed Officers, with Colours flying, and Drums beating, and with Mottos on their Ensigns, which serv'd to incite o∣thers to joyn in their Rebellion. They at first attempted a Castle belonging to the Count de Thun, (who was Envoy about that time in England, for the Emperor) where they expected to find Arms; but missing thereof, they proceeded on other Designs, but were interrupted, and stop'd by Count Piccolomini, who was sent with Forces to reduce them to Obedience. Whereupon these Rebels made a second Experiment, of sending their Deputies to represent their Aggrievances, who were as before clap'd into Prison. But Advices coming, that some other Counties were up in Arms in like manner, and for the same Cause,The Empe∣ror accom∣modates the Matter between the Lords, and their Te∣nants. the Deputies were set at Liberty; and a General Pardon Granted to all those who would lay down their Arms, and remit their Pleas to be Treat∣ed at the Tribunals of Justice. Upon this Declaration, five thousand submitted, and return'd to their own Habitations. And the Emperor himself, upon hearing the Cause between the Lords, and the Paisants, did determine that the Paisants should be oblig'd only to Labour three days for their Lords, whereas formerly they were constrain'd to the Service of five Days in the Week; having but one single Day allow'd them for the Care and Support of their Family. In the mean time,The Poles press to have a Treaty Signed. the Resident for the King of Poland, at Vienna, press'd very instantly to have the League between his Master, and the Emperor against the Turk to be Compleated, and Sign'd; to which at length this Answer was given. That so soon as the Poles had drawn the Mos∣covites into an Union with them; and that the Turks had also declar'd a War, that then the Treaty which was already drawn, should immediately be Sign'd. Tekeli on the other side, offer'd New Propositions of Peace, and in the mean time desir'd a Cessation of Arms. Upon which, the Emperor having call'd his Council, it was Resolv'd by them, that all Treaties with him for the future, should be absolutely deny'd; in regard, that by experience he had always been found false, and perfidious in every Trea∣ty, having broken his Faith and Promises whensoever it serv'd his turn not to per∣form them. Besides, it was well remem∣ber'd in what manner he had formerly made use of Cessations of Arms,The Empe∣ror refuses to Treat with Tekeli to de∣bauch the Minds of the Emperor's Sol∣diers, and to seduce and divert them from their Loyalty, and Allegiance. More∣over, the Propositions now tender'd, were of the same nature and temperament with
those which had been so often rejected, and which tended to the diminution of his Imperial Majesty's Authority.And the Reasons why. As namely, the Emperor was to suffer the People to make Choice of a New Pala∣tine, according to the Ancient Constitu∣tions: That the Estates of the Malecon∣tents which had been Confiscated for their Rebellion should be restor'd; and that the German Garrisons should be with∣drawn out of all the Towns of Hungary, and Troops of that Nation admitted into their Places. These being the Old and Stale Points so often controverted and re∣jected; it was concluded that Tekeli did not again repeat and make offer of them, in hopes of an accommodation, but to amuse the minds of the People, and to serve some purpose, which he desir'd to con∣ceal. At the same time Count Serini, to whom his Estate Confiscated had been lately restor'd; had by some secret Infor∣mations fallen into suspicion of keeping a Correspondence with the Malecontents; for which Reason he was taken into Cu∣stody,Count Seri∣ni suspe∣cted, and Imprisoned. and his Papers seiz'd; and several other Hungarian Gentlemen committed to Prison for Complices with him in the same Plot; and were all afterwards car∣ried to Prague, where Orders were given to take the Informations, and draw up the Indictment against them. Accordingly the Examinations were made, and a close inspection into certain Letters wrote in Characters to Count Tekeli, which gave just Cause of Jealousie and Suspicion of an unlawful Correspondence. Howsoever, when the Letters came to be Decyphered, and nothing found to be therein contain'd, but Arguments and Perswasions unto Te∣keli to accept the Offers made by the Emperor; the which he urg'd and en∣forc'd by assurances in such Case, of be∣ing instrumental in the Marriage with his Sister the Princess Ragotski (for whom he knew that Tekeli conserv'd a Passion) Se∣rini was then acquitted, and restor'd a∣gain to his Estate,He is clear∣ed, and set at liberty. after a Months Impri∣sonment; and License given him to Visit his Sister the Princess at Mongatz. At his Arrival at this Court, he was joyfully Wellcom'd by all those who had a ten∣derness for that Family; and the Princess her self receiv'd a seasonable Consolation from the Company of her Brother; be∣ing then in Mourning, and in Affliction for the Death of her Mother-in-Law, the Princess Dowager; which Occasion Count Tekeli took to pass the Complement, by an express Messenger of Condoleance with her. Tekeli being now Recruited with con∣siderable Numbers both of Turks,Tekeli i∣vides his Army into three Bo∣dies. and Tartars, divided his Army into three Bo∣dies; the one Commanded by himself, and the other two by Petrozzi, and Palaffi-Imbre, with intent to enter into the Hereditary Countries by three several ways. Against which Forces the Emperor sent Count Staremberg Governour of Vi∣enna, and Major General Haran, with all the Troops belonging to Moravia, Stiria, and Austria. Staremberg had the fortune to Encounter one Party of them as they were breaking into Moravia, and gave them a Repulse; howsoever in their Re∣treat they took a Redoubt, which was built upon the Waagh, in which were three hundred Soldiers, whom they to∣tally Defeated. In Revenge of which, Count Dunewald Routed another Party of the Malecontents,The Impe∣rialists have seve∣ral Succes∣ses. consisting of five hun∣dred, of which, three hundred were kil∣led upon the place, and fifty Officers and Soldiers taken Prisoners, with four Colours, on which was this Inscription. Comes Tekeli qui pro Deo, & Patriâ pugnat. Count Caprara with ten thousand Men advanc'd as far as Erlaw, to observe the motions of Tekeli; Count Staremberg at∣tended Palaffi-Imbre, whose Design was to enter into Moravia, and by a Detatch∣ment from his Army, overthrew three thousand Men Commanded by Petrozzi, who with much difficulty made his escape. The Emperor being sensible that his Enemies increas'd, and that frequent los∣ses enfeebled and abated his Army, caus'd several New Regiments to be rais'd, the Officers of which were all chosen and put in by Father Emeric the Emperor's Confessor, and Abelé the Chief Secretary of State, by which two the good Empe∣ror was entirely directed, and govern'd, which General Montecuculi having observ'd, and how Men were preferr'd by favour only to Great Commands, who were nei∣ther Soldiers, nor capable of those Trusts, he took the freedom to advise the Empe∣ror,Montecu∣culi's Coun∣sel to the Emperor. that in the choice of his New Offi∣cers, respect was had to Favour, rather than unto Merit; and that little good Success could be expected from such un∣able and improper Instruments. The Au∣thority of so Wise a Minister of State, and so Old a Captain, prevail'd so far with his Imperial Majesty, that the former Com∣missions granted by Recommendations of Father Emeric were call'd in, and others issued, unto such who were Warranted and
Vouch'd by more competent Judges of Mi∣litary Affairs. Towards the end of this Campaign, Fortune seem'd to favour both sides with various Successes;Various Successes, and Chan∣ces of War. what the Emperor gain'd in one Place, the Malecontents re∣cover'd in another; so that all Countries were fill'd with Blood, and Ruine, and Destruction of the People, without any hopes or prospect of coming to a con∣clusion. Upon consideration of which, the Pious Emperor commiserating the Af∣flictions of his People,Overtures of Peace made by the Empe∣ror. resolv'd to make one Trial and Essay more, to see if it were possible to bring Matters to an end, by way of an Amicable Agreement; and to that purpose, he conven'd a Diet at Oedemburg, where the Malecontents gave in these Grievances, made in Transilvania, and Written Originally in Latin.

Eapropter quoad aequalitatem & aequita∣tem salariorum hoc in passu quoque non citra legalem rationem, uti Catholicis Plebanis, aliisque, ita etiam Evangelicis Ministris & Scholae docentibus, ex communibus proventi∣bus, publicoque civitatum aerario, parem & coaequalem, citra ullam difficultatem penden∣dam exsolutionem: Secusne utri partium ad∣ministrandam solutionem, verum ad mentem praecitatorum articulorum, ut quilibet status suos interteneat & exsolvat sibi servientes, iisque etiam suos pendat stolares proventus, clementissimam, justitiaeque & juri consonam Constitutionem efflagitarent quam subjectis∣sime. Sexto: Cuilibet in propatulo publicum est, vi Artic. 25 Praedicantibus & Scholarum Magistris non solum liberum in regnum redi∣tum, liberam{que} in Regno mansionem, sed & li∣beram Religionis suae professionem & exercitiì functionem concessam: Adhaec{que} in partibus Hungariae superioribus vi subsequentis 26 Artic. inter ceteras Regias ac liberas Civitates Cassoviensem quoque & Epperiensem Civitates pro locis Articularibus, libere & publice ibidem Religionem Evangelicam exercendi, constitutas, & stabilitas, adeoque, ut post hac nullae exercitii turbationes ab utrimque, sub poena in Artic. 8 Uladislai Decret. 6. expressa fiant, definitum esse.

Quin utut tenore saepius allegati Artic. 26. usus sepulturae & campanarum indifferenter, uti Catholocis ita & Evangelicis esset liber relictus, nihilominus exsanguia Evangelicorum corpora contra ipsum jus Christianitatis in solito sepul∣turae loco terrae mandari impediuntur.

THE GRIEVANCES Of the two Imperial and Free Cities of Ʋpper Hungary, Cas∣sovia, and Epperies; wherein are Contain'd the Injuries done to all the Protestant Citizens and Inhabitants of the three Ranks, as well in their Civil Liberties, against the 25th, 26th, and 41st Articles of the Diet of Sopron, An. 1681. together with their Demands. FIRST, It must be allow'd that in the 26th Article of that Diet, by the Special Favour of His most Sacred Majesty, 'twas ex∣presly Ordain'd in these very Words: But in other parts 'tis Order'd ac∣cording to His Majesty's Gracious Resolution that Places be appointed for the Building of Churches and Schools, and Erecting Pa∣rishes for the Conveniency of those of the Helvetian Confession, and of that of Ausbourg. That instead of the Churches, Schools, and Parishes taken from the Protestants, there should be Assign'd them by Commis∣sioners appointed from His Majesty, com∣modious and convenient Places, and that without any Restriction, even in the Ci∣ties of upper Hungary, according to the literal and genuine sense of the Clause of the said Article, which saith, Furthermore in the Free and Mountain Cities, as also in all the Cities of upper Hungary are Places to be allow'd for the Building of Churches and Schools, and Erecting Parishes. Nevertheless in the beginning of January, in the year 1687. His Majesty's High-Commissioners appointed with so much Clemency in upper Hungary, were so far in their proceedings from satisfying either His Majesty's pious Resolution, or the true and clear intent of the Article, that even in contempt of them all, and in com∣pliance with their own false Glosses, they did assign to the Protestants inconvenient and undecent places without the said Ci∣ties, which have no Suburbs, and conse∣quently very remote in the Fields, to the evident exterminating of the free Exercise of our Religion from the said Cities. Wherefore we do constantly insist on the most Holy Resolution of His Majesty, as it is declar'd in the express'd words of the Article before alledg'd, and by vertue thereof, do humbly implore, that instead of the inconvenient appointed Places such others (as shall be both commodious and free from all Civil Taxes or Contributions, according to the intention of the 8th Ar∣ticle, An. 1647. and the 12th, An. 1649. in the above-mentioned Cities, and within the Walls of the same, without any Am∣biguity, since the before-cited 26th Article includeth the inward, not the outward parts of the Cities) be granted and as∣sign'd to us the true and lawful Citizens, and in no wise deserving so unjust a Ba∣nishment from the midst of the Cities. Secondly, 'tis also undeniable, that in the 25th Article, immediately foregoing, the Gracious Resolution of His most Sacred Majesty is declar'd in these very words: To all and every one through the Kingdom (no Protestant Inhabitant of whatsoever State and Condition, or in whatever part of the Kingdom excepted) according to the 1st Article in the year 1608. published be∣fore the Coronation, a free Exercise of their Religion in general is granted, and also that none of the said Inhabitants shall any wise be disturbed for the future in the free Exercise of their Religion, on the severe punishment that is expresly set down in the 26th Arti∣cle of the Diet of Sopron. Notwithstanding which, when the said Protestants of Cassovia and Epperies would have freely us'd and enjoy'd their Right Establish'd by His Majesty's Warrant, and continu'd their way of Worship, as also the Instruction of their Youth within the said Cities, and their Walls (as places provided by the above-mention'd Articles, and formerly us'd and allow'd) they were not only not admitted, but severely prohi∣bited and hindred by the Magistrates and Clergy of these Cities, nay sent away and
Banish'd till this time, to the fore-specified places in no wise convenient for them, as if they were Strangers and wholly incapa∣ble of the Common Liberties of the King∣dom. Wherefore in this Point also Relying on the Gracious Resolution of His most Sacred Majesty, and the Articles he has been pleased to make with us, We do most Humbly implore a lawful Restitution and firm Establishment of the free exercise of our Religion in its former State, according to the said Article 1st Anno 1608 (viz.) within the Walls of the said Cities. We also submissively beg, that till we have a con∣venient opportunity of Building and Ere∣cting new Churches, Schools and Parishes (which by reason of our great Poverty, and the vast Taxes and Contributions to the present War, we are not able now to perform) it be graciously granted to us, that we may anew freely enjoy the said exercise of Religion in certain private and convenient places, and have Schools for the Instruction of Youth. Thirdly, Though the indifferent and common life of Bells and Burials was every where permitted, as well to the Protestants as Catholicks by these express words, of the 26th Article of the Diet of Sopron: The free use of Bells and Burials is left to the Catholicks of those places, as well as to those of the Helvetian Confession, and of that of Ausbourg. Which nevertheless, the Catholick Magistracy and Clergy of Cassovia and Epperies have fully deny'd, and do still deny the said free use of Bells and Burials to the Protestant Inhabitants of the said Cities, forbidding them with most severe Threats, to perform the usual Ceremonies of Burials, within the Walls of the said Cities; notwithstanding the gracious reso∣lution of His most Sacred Majesty, made to the illustrious States of the Kingdom, in the Diet of Sopron, December the 10th, Anno 1681. So that we earnestly desire the common use of Bells and Burials for the Protestants, as well within, as without the City Walls, free from any molestation or disturbance, conformable to the Pious Grant of His most Sacred Majesty. Fourthly, It is evident also, that by Ver∣tue of the general Clause inserted in the end of the so often mention'd 26th Article in these words: Provided always, That the Laws of the Kingdom confirm'd by the Royal Charter be not hereby prejudiced. The standing Laws of the Kingdom con∣cerning the Ecclesiastical Revenues of those of the Helvetian Confession, and of that of Ausbourg were left in force, and conse∣quently any Arbitrary proceedings forbid∣den, especially such as against the instinct of Nature, tend to the enriching of some Persons, to the Damage and Wrong of others. Nevertheless, the Roman Catholick Ma∣gistrate and the Clergy of Cassovia and Ep∣peries, by their own Authority, and by Force have taken and appropriated to themselves, all the pious Legacies and Gifts left by Will, through the pious zeal of the Protestants, for the use of Protestant Churches and Schools, (viz. in Cassovia, four Houses standing within the Wall of the said City, one of which the Magistrate has sold, and alienated to the illustrious Michael Domeczki; a Garden and certain Plow Lands lying in the Territory of the same City; as also a Vineyard formerly called Varghaszóló, lying in the Territory of Tokai. And in Epperies certain Vineyards likewise lying in several Territories of Upper Hungary, together with their Revenues) actually retaining the same for their own use, and for the most part turning them into prophane uses, against the 11th and 14th Articles of the year 1647, to the great injury and damage of the Protestants. Wherefore in this Case also, the Prote∣stants appealing to the aforesaid Laws, and Constitution of the Kingdom, do lawfully require, that all the pious Legacies and Church Lands (violently taken away and retain'd from them, who are the right Owners) be restor'd together with their Revenues, according to that Rule of Com∣mon Justice, Render to every one his own. Fifthly, It is certain likewise, that for the paying of the Protestant Ministers, and of the Catholick Curates, it was evidently enough provided, not only by the often mentioned 26th Article in these words: Nevertheless, the Catholicks shall not be obliged to pay any thing to the Ministers of the Protestants, nor the Protestants to the Curates of the Catholicks. But also by the 11th Article of the year 1647 in these words; Let no Protestant be obliged to pay any thing to the Catholick Curates, nor the Catholick to the Protestant Ministers. Nay, in the following 12th Article of the said year 1647, are contained these words: Concerning any use whatever of the Ministerial Functions; but where the Prote∣stants have no Parishes, let them pay the Mi∣nisters that they employ, as the Catholicks are to pay their Catholick Curates; and where hitherto the Protestants did pay nothing to
the Catholick Curates, they shall not be obliged hereafter to pay any under any pretence what∣soever, nor the Catholicks to the Protestant Minsters. Which words, together with these of the same 12th Article concerning the Reve∣nues of Schools; but in any place what∣soever, the Catholick Curates, and the Pro∣testant Ministers shall receive the Revenues of Schools, from their respective Follow∣ers only. Establish this positive Law and Constitution, that the Protestants pay the Protestants, and the Catholicks the Catho∣licks: Notwithstanding this, the Prote∣stants are forced maugre themselves, to pay the Catholick Curates, whilst not only a Weekly allowance, together with other perquisites, is constantly paid to the Ca∣tholick Curates by the Magistrate out of the publick Purse (wherein the Protestants put most, being three for one Catholick;) but also, the Revenues of Schools are ad∣judged, and paid to the same Catholick Cu∣rates, and with the greatest injustice deny'd to the Protestant Ministers and School-Masters. Therefore they demand with all Sub∣mission and Justice, that the Protestant Mi∣nisters and School-masters, be allow'd out of the publick Purse, a Salary equal with that of the Catholick Curates, or that nei∣ther of the Parties be paid out of that Fond, but each by their respective Follow∣ers, according to the intention of the before mention'd Articles. Sixthly, Every body knows that by Vertue of the 25th Article, not only a free return and stay in the Kingdom is granted to the Banisht Ministers and School-masters, but also a free exercise of their Religion and Profession, and by Vertue of the fol∣lowing 26th Article it is Order'd, That a∣mongst the imperial and free Cities of Up∣per Hungary, Cassovia and Epperies shall be appointed, and establish'd places for the publick and free exercise of the Protestant Religion; and that hereafter, no Subject shall be disturb'd in the free exercise of his Religion, under the pain expressed in the 8th Article, of the 6th Decree of Ula∣dislaus. Nevertheless, the Magistrate of Ep∣peries, on the very Festival Day of St. Bartholomew the Apostle, in the Year 1688 last past, dar'd deprive the Protestant Church of Epperies, establish'd by the Arti∣cles of their Ministers, and with great dishonour expel all the Protestant Ministers of the three Nations, out of the said City and its Territory, without letting them know any cause of so injust an usage, or shewing them any Warrant of His most Sacred Majesty for it; protending only an unheard of Title of Lord of the Manor, (which cannot be admitted among Civili∣ans, since they enjoy equaly with the Ma∣gistrate the common civil Liberty, nor amongst Clergy Men, who enjoy a special Liberty, nor can it in any wise be taken by Magistrate, whose Office is but for a year) to the great diminishing of His most Sacred Majesty's Authority and the Con∣tempt of the before mentioned Articles. Wherefore they humbly beg, that the innocent and unjustly Banish'd Protestant Ministers of Epperies be restor'd, and may perform as before their Ecclesiastical Duties, and that both the Protestant Ministers of Cassovia, and those of Epperies, employ'd either in Preaching, or in Teaching Schools, present or to come (being always presented by the right Patrons,) may live quietly and safely in their own or hir'd dwelling places, which they have, or shall have within the Walls of the said Cities. Seventhly, No body that knows the Law will deny, but in the beginning of the aforesaid 41st Article of the Diet of Sopron, where the Common Liberties and Privile∣ges of the imperial and free Cities are confirm'd, and besides the there mention'd Laws, and Articles of the Kingdom made in several places are renewed, it is expresly ordain'd: That the same Laws and Articles be strictly observed, both by the Chambers and the Officers of the Army, and by any other person whatsoever, so that they (viz. the same imperial and free Cities) be no way disturbed by any one, in their free right to chuse a Civil Magistrate, nor in any other Privilege. Nevertheless, the modern Magistrate of the said Cities, against the Prohibition con∣tain'd in the 83th Article of the Illustrious Chamber of Scepusium, in the year 1647, out of meer private hatred against our Religion; was pleased to take upon him such a Power, as to degrade, and turn out of their publick Dignities, and Civil Em∣ployments all the Senators of Cassovia and Epperies, and several other Protestant Of∣ficers well deserving, and qualified for pub∣lick Offices and Civil Dignities, against the evident Constitution of the aforesaid Ar∣ticle, and of those that are cited in it; but especially of the 13th, before the Corona∣tion in the year 1608, of the 44th in the year 1609, and of the 12th in the year 1649, to the most evident prejudice of the Common Liberties, and Civil Privileges, and to the considerable oppression of the Protestant Citizens; and in the room of the said Senators and Protestant Officers, the said Magistrate has put Catholick Ci∣tizens either less fit, or wholly unacquain∣ted
with the Affairs of the said Cities, and more minding their private concerns, to the damnifying and even undoing of the said Cities. Wherefore we require with the deepest Humility, First, That the free right of chusing the Civil Magistrate, and other Officers (which hitherto has been so disturbed, and wholly taken away from the Prote∣stants, against the positive Laws of the Kingdom, made in the Illustrious Cham∣ber of Scepusium) belonging properly and only to the Sworn Citizens of the same Cities, and as well to the Protestants as to the Catholicks, be restor'd and maintain'd in its former State, and in no wise any more disturbed by any one, under the pain mention'd in the renewed and aforesaid Articles. Secondly, That in order to maintain a civil mutual Union, and put out any Fewel of Division and Hatred, a free Election be made of the same Magistrate, and other Officers out of the well deserving, and well qualified Sworn Citizens, without any dif∣ference of the Catholick and Protestant Religion; and that the Employments, and any Civil Dignities whatsoever be indiffe∣rently, and equally conferr'd and bestowed, so that the Catholicks and Protestants pro∣mote mutually one another to publick, civil Honours, according to the intention of the aforesaid 13th Article, of the year 1608 before the Coronation, and of the 44th of the year 1609. Thirdly, That in order to observe a just equality of Turns, and procure the publick good of the Cities, it be graciously granted, that the Offices of Judge and Tribune be by Turns, and promiscuously exercised for a year, according to the intention of the aforesaid Articles, and of the 12th in the year 1649. All the Protestant, Citizens, and Inhabitants of the three Nations, of the Free and Imperial Cities, Cas∣sovia and Epperies. The Grievance of the Protestants of the Free and Imperial City of Carpona. IT is not without a great deal of Grief, that all the Noblemen and Gentlemen, all the Auxiliary Forces, and hired Soldiers of both sorts, and all the Protestant Inhabitants, and Citizens of Carpona, think it their Duty to Represent to Your most Sacred Majesty; that altho' according to Your most Sacred Majesty's Resolution, inserted in the 26th Article of the Diet of Sopron, Anno 1681. Among the places of the Kingdom, which were to be appointed for the Building of new Churches and Schools, and Erecting Parishes for the conveniency of those of the Helvetian Confession, and of that of Ausbourg; the same City of Carpona is par∣ticularly named, and established to be one of the places, where the free exercise of Religion should entirely and quietly be en∣joyed, as it may be seen in these words: In the Division before the Mountains at Leva, Carpona and Tulekin. Nevertheless, Your Majesty's High Com∣missioners appointed in the year 1688 last past in the Mountain Cities, being come to that of Carpona (whereas, according to the intention of the aforesaid Article, and of Your Majesty's Gracious Resolution, and Declaration contain'd in it, instead of the convenient Churches and Schools and Pa∣rishes which were from the Protestants of the Confession of Ausbourg, they should have appointed other convenient and fit places, and left the Protestants in the quiet Possession of them, according to the intenti∣on of the 19th Article in the year 1647,) did on the contrary turn the Protestant Mini∣sters and School-masters out of their Of∣fices, and with severe Threats forbid both all the Protestant Noblemen and Gentle∣men, all the Soldiers of the Garison, as well as all the Inhabitants and Citizens, to continue the Exercise of Religion (which had been enjoy'd in the same place from time out of Memory, and was confirm'd by the Articles as we have already said) till Your Majesty's further Resolution were known, to the great prejudice of a Spiri∣tual Exercise, which suffers no delay, and to the diminishing of the Right granted to the Protestants by the Articles, and con∣firm'd by Your Majesty's Favour. Therefore they do wholly Rely on the Articles, and Your Majesty's Grant, and Humbly beg, that not only convenient and fit places, within the Walls of the said City be appointed to them, for the Buil∣ding of Churches and Schools, and Ere∣cting Parishes; but also, that they may have a Free Exercise of Religion, together with the common and indifferent use of Bells and Burials, according to the afore∣said 26th Article of Sopron, and as they had formerly. The Grievances of the Imperial and Free Protestant Cities, Veterozolium, Breznobania and Libethbania. ALL the Protestants of the same Im∣perial and Free Cities, set forth their most lamentable Case in respect of Religion,
that whereas they should not be hinder'd to enjoy at least in private the free Exercise of Religion granted by the Articles of Sopron, to all and every where in the Kingdom (without excepting any part of it, and less the fourth State, which comprehends all the Imperial and Free Cities of the Kingdom, belonging properly to the Crown) through His Imperial Majesty's Favour, according to the clear and evident explica∣tion of the 1st Article made before the Co∣ronation, in the year 1608. and confirm'd in the 25th Article of Sopron, but rather by virtue of the following 26th Article of Sopron (which speaks in general of the Cities, and by way of instance names only two of each sort; viz. of the Mountain Cities, and of the Free Cities) His Ma∣jesty's High Commissioners appointed in the year 1688. should also have appointed them commodious and convenient places for the building of new Churches and Schools, and erecting Parishes, yet they have obtain'd nothing: On the contrary, the Ministers have been turn'd at and ex∣pell'd by the High Commissioners, and the Protestants have been most severely for∣bidden by the same to exercise their Reli∣gion in private, or to go to any Neigh∣bouring place where their Religion is Ex∣ercised Moreover against the express grant of the 11th and 12th Article in the year 1647. maugre the Protestants and by force, the said High Commissioners have assign'd and appropriated all the proper Revenues of Schools and Churches to the Catholick Curates which they have brought in, and have very few Followers in the Cities of Veterozolium, and Breznobania, and but one in Libethbania. In fine, the said High Commissioners did by all means, and do still compell without distinction, all the Protestant Inhabitants and Citizens, espe∣cially the Trades and Handy-craft-men to Ceremonies contrary to their Religion; therefore the said Protestants humbly beg the same Liberty of Religion as is granted in the Articles, and enjoy'd in other Cities, since these in no wise deserve a worse case; and that there may be assign'd them conve∣nient places for the building of new Chur∣ches, and Schools, and erecting Parishes. The Grievances of the Free and Im∣perial Cities St. George, Bazinga, Tyrnaw, Szakoliza, Kussegh, and Rust. THese Free and Imperial Cities do also lament and set forth their desolate Case, and great Unhappiness in respect of Religion; that (whereas according to the genuine Sense of the Articles of Sopron, made in the behalf of Religion, its free Exercise is granted to everyone, and every where in the Kingdom) they should not be hinder'd to enjoy, at least in private the said free Exercise of Religion; but by Vir∣tue of the 26th Article of Sopron, which speaks in general of the Cities, Places should have been appointed them for the Building of Churches, and Schools, and Erecting Parishes, yet they have obtain'd none of the premisses; but on the con∣trary, have been forbidden to exercise any way their Religion, their Ministers have been expell'd, and forbidden to come any more into the said Cities; it is prohibited under the forest punishment to frequent the places where there is Exercise of Religion, to go thither, to have Children Baptiz'd, or to receive the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, and to send for Protestant Mini∣sters to Sick and Dying Persons; in a word, the whole Exercise of the Protestant Religion is forbidden, against the sense of the aforesaid Articles, and the Protestants are compell'd to Ceremonies contrary to their Religion; therefore they humbly beg that they may enjoy the same Benefit as is granted in the Articles, and have places ap∣pointed them for the Building of Churches, and Schools, and Erecting Parishes, as well as the other Cities; since that Pri∣vilege is equally granted to all; and there∣fore the case of some, ought not to be worse than that of others. The Grievances of the Free and Imperial Cities, Trenschin, and Modra. THese two Free and Imperial Cities complain with a great deal of Sor∣row, that by Virtue of the 26th Article of Sopron, the Lords Commissioners did indeed assign to them places for the Build∣ing of Churches and Schools, and erecting Parishes, and grant them the free Exercise of their Religion; but with such Limita∣tion and Restraint as take away many things essentially requisite and necessary for the said exercise of Religion, and are directly contrary to the genuine intention of the Articles; as, First, The Lords Commissioners did les∣sen the Number of the Protestant Ministers, and forbid others to be put in their room after their Death. Secondly, They did forbid all the Pro∣testants (to whom a free Exercise of Re∣ligion is granted, by Virtue of that Ge∣neral
Clause of the 25th Article, to every one, and every where in the Kingdom) to frequent the Neighbouring Churches, and perform in them any duty of Religion. Thirdly, They did forbid the Ministers to Visit the Estrangers, were they never so Sick. Fourthly, They did Order that the Handy-craft-men, and common sort of Peo∣ple should be compell'd under severe pu∣nishment to Ceremonies contrary to their way, viz. To walk with the Catholicks in Procession, and carry processional Trophies. Fifthly, They did forbid the Protestant Ministers to go and Administer Baptism, or perform other Ceremonies in the Neigh∣bouring Towns. Sixthly, They did appoint that there should be no petty Schools, but such where Children could Learn only to Read, and to Write. The Grievances of the Counties of Ʋp∣per Hungary, Semlin, Abavivar, Unghwar, Saraz, Tornaw, &c. and of all the Protestant Noblemen and Gentlemen living in the Moun∣tain Towns of the Principality of Tokai. THe same Protestants are forc'd to Re∣present to Your Most Sacred Ma∣jesty, that although in the following words of the 26th Article of Sopron, but in other Counties, as in those of Salawar, Vesprim, Saraz, Moramoruss, Abavivar, Sellia, Semlin, Ugoza, Bodrogh, Tornaw, Komarra, Barzod, Sachsag, Novigrad, Zolnock, Hewecz, Pesth, Pelicz and Soldth united, Chege, Unghwar, and Zatmar, since the Protestants are in possession of almost all the Churches there, the same Churches are left for the use of the actual Possessors of them. And in the following Clause of the said Article: Finally the Churches which are actually possessed by those of the Helvetian Confession, and of that of Ausbourg, shall be still for their use as before, together with the Parishes, and Schools, and their Reve∣nues, that they may live in peace, and quiet. Your most Sacred Majesty tending the peace and general quiet of the Kingdom, has been Graciously pleas'd to Ordain, that in the foregoing Counties, all the Church∣es, Parishes, and Schools, together with their Revenues, should be left for the use of the Protestants. Nevertheless, the Churches standing in the Counties of Aba∣vivar, Saraz, Semlin, Tornaw, and Ungh∣war, (which for the most part have been built from the foundation, or repair'd from the lowest ruine by the Protestants) as also the Schools and Parishes, together with their Revenues (left to them by the Protestants in their Wills, and never be∣fore possess'd by the Roman Catholicks) have been taken by force from the Prote∣stants, as well as the Churches, Parishes, and Schools, standing in the Dominion of Rakocz, in these Towns of the County of Semlin, Zantho, Thalia, Mod, Kerethur, Tarazal, Liszka, Benny, Toleswa, Ughelly, Patak, Borssy, (which at the time of the Articles of Sopron, and after, were possess'd by the Protestants, and left to the same by the said Articles) in several Towns of the Principality of Tokai, and in Tokai it self; altho' the Church of Tokai was left, and expresly confirm'd by the Articles in the possession of the Protestants. To this may be added, That against the evident sense of the 25th Article of Sopron, the Protestant Noblemen and Gentlemen of the aforesaid Cities of the County of Sem∣lin, have been, and are still forc'd to for∣bear exercising their Religion in private; which Liberty they had enjoy'd since the seizing of their Churches, and was granted to them by the first Article made before the Coronation, in the year 1608. and confirm'd by the same 25th Article of the Diet of Sopron. Likewise the Ministers (call'd back from their Exile through Your most Sacred Ma∣jesty's Favour, by Virtue of the aforesaid 25th Article of Sopron,) are forc'd to oblige themselves under pain of death, and the forfeiture of all their Goods, to go out of the same County, or by strict Deeds of reversion to renounce for ever under the same Penalty, to perform any Ecclesiasti∣cal Duty in the said County. Moreover, although the 25th Article of Sopron evidently declareth that none of the Helvetian Confession, and of that of Aus∣bourg shall be compell'd to any Ceremony contrary to his Religion; and the 26th, that the Catholicks shall not be oblig'd to pay any thing to the Ministers of the Protestants, nor the Protestants to the Cu∣rates of the Catholicks, according to the intent of the 11th Article, in the year 1647. yet they are forc'd even by Military Exe∣cution to do both, and especially to pay the Catholick Curates. Although by vertue of the often-men∣tion'd 26th Article, the free use of Bells and Burials is equally left to the Catho∣licks, and to the Protestants, nevertheless the Protestants are not suffer'd to bury their
Dead in the usual Burying-places, which is against Christianity it self, they are not permitted neither to use the Bells though made through their care; nay the Noblemen and Gentlemen of the aforesaid Dominion of Rakotz are threatned to be dispossess'd and exterminated out of their Estates, if they do not abjure and renounce the Protestant Religion, which is a down right persecu∣tion of the Protestants. In the like man∣ner the Protestants of Abavivar are forbid∣den by the Purveyor of that County to exercise their Religion; and the Ministers are commanded under pain of Death, and the forfeiture of all their Goods to go out of it, or (if they be willing to continue there as Secular private persons) by most strict deeds of reversion to renounce for ever under the same penalty to perform any Ecclesiastical Duty; consequently the Protestant Churches, together with all their Appurtenances have been seiz'd upon by the said Purveyor. Likewise in a Town called Sepssy of the same County of Abavivar, where the Church could under no pretence be taken from the Protestants, the Tythes of the Territory of the said Town which us'd to belong to the Protestant Minister are seiz'd, and kept in Sequestration by the  of Sepssy, by vertue of an Order of the Il∣lustrious Chamber of Scepusium. In the Towns of Nogymihali, Vinna, and Iztara, in the County of Unghwar, and in the Towns of Tolzeck and Asguth, in the County of Saraz, the Churches, Schools, and Parishes left by the Articles for the use of the Protestants, are by force taken and kept from them by the Catholick Lords of those Mannors. Lastly, In the Town call'd Somogy in the County of Torna, a moiety of the Re∣venue belonging to the Protestant Minister by a Convention made formerly is taken from him. All which having been attempted against Your Majesty's Gracious Resolution, and the Articles made in the behalf of the Pro∣testants, they present the same to Your most Sacred Majesty's Consideration, with strong persuasion that it will be Graciously Remedied; and that not only they shall be re-setled in the possession of what is taken from 'em; but also that all the intro∣duc'd abuses shall be taken away. The same Protestant Inhabitants of the aforesaid Counties of Upper Hungary, and of the Towns stand∣ing in the Dominion of Rakoczia. The same is done by the Counties of Salawar, Vesprim, Saraz, Moramoruss, Novigrad, Zolnock, Hevecz, Pesth and Soldth, united, which are all comprehended in the Articles. The Grievances of all the Protestant Noblemen of the Counties of Liep∣ze, Thurocz, Arva, Trenschin; Zolnock, and Sachsag; wherein are contain'd the Injuries and Troubles they have sustain'd upon the account of Religion, against the Articles of Sopron; together with Humble Request for the Redressing of the same. SInce the Grievances and Complaints of the Counties of Liepze, Thurocz, Ar∣va, Trenschin, and Zolnock agree in all re∣spects, for shortness sake they are put to∣gether here; the same then justly com∣plain that they have been injur'd and di∣sturbed, in that the Protestant Ministers (who perform'd the Duties of their pro∣fession in the Noblemens places of Resi∣dence, where the free Exercise of Religion was transferr'd, by Virtue of the 26th Article of Sopron, since the seizing of the Protestant Churches in these Counties) have all been Banish'd (except two, left in two places named in the Articles) with∣in a fortnight, out of the County and place where they liv'd; or if any desir'd to continue in it, he was requir'd to oblige himself by strict deed of Reversion never to perform any Ecclesiastical Duty, and forbidden to remain on any other term, un∣der pain of Imprisonment. No Schools are permitted but the Petty (or as the Commissioners term it, such where Children learn only to Read and to Write) and but in two places mention'd in the Articles; all the others are generally shut, and prohibited, and their Masters turn'd out, although the 25th Article had restor'd both these, and the Ministers in their respective Offices. It is strictly forbidden that the Divine Service and Exercise of Religion be per∣formed by Protestant Ministers in the Hou∣ses and places of Residence of Noblemen, or in the Oratories and Chappels belong∣ing to them, but with this admirable Li∣mitation; That if any Noble-Man will have the Divine Service done in his House, he shall employ no other Minister than one of the two left in the County, and that only for themselves, and their Family. All the Payments whatsoever (except those which belong to the two Schools appointed in each County) are adjudg'd to
the Catholick Curates, and are generally wrested by the same with the help of the Soldiers. The Peasants are absolutely forbidden to Exercise their Religion in the use of Baptism, Marriage, Confirmation, Burials, and of the Lord's Supper, as also to fre∣quent the places appointed by the Articles for the Divine Service, and are compelled with all possible violence, to Ceremonies contrary to their way. Moreover, in many Towns of the County of Turocz, as in Bella Zatureza and Pribocz, there were Churches Built at the Charges of the Protestants, whose Members had not reconciled themselves to the Church of Rome, before the Article was made; yet without any regard to the Exception con∣tain'd in the beginning of the 26th Article, all those Churches have been seized upon, and the use of Bells and Burials is granted no more to the Protestants, unless they ask and pay the Catholick Curates for it. In the County of Sachsag, the Prote∣stants should freely and peaceably have en∣joyed all the Churches, which were in their Possession when the Article was made, and were left for their use by the same Article; yet the Illustrious Wolffgang Earl of Kohary, (Supreme Earl of the said County, by De∣putation (as he has declar'd) of the Illu∣strious George Earl of Erdedy,) with the assistance of the Vicount of the same County, has seized the same Churches, except a very small one, which stands in a most despi∣cable Village called Drieno, and has not been Built by the Protestants: Command∣ing withal all the Protestant Ministers to go out of their respective Parishes, and places of abode under pain of Emprisonment, and forbidding all Persons of quality to enter∣tain them any way even privately; altho' the Protestants of this County had been establish'd, and confirm'd in the free use of all the Churches, which were in their Pos∣session when the Article was made. The most Humble and Lawful De∣mands of the aforesaid Counties are these. SInce His most Sacred Majesty both by the Confirmation of the 25th and 26th Articles of the Diet of Sopron, made in 21st Article of the Diet of Presburg, in the year 1687, and by the Resolution declar'd to the Deputies of the said Counties in their Audience, has engaged his Royal Word, not only to observe the aforesaid Articles in all their Points and Clauses, but also to cause the others to observe the same; therefore the Protestants of the aforesaid Counties Humbly beg, that ac∣cording to the most simple and evident Sense of the same Articles, they may be Redressed, Re-establish'd, Restor'd, and by an express Decree confirm'd in the following particulars. That according to the intention of the the 25th Article of the Diet of Sopron, all their Ministers and Rectors may live freely among them, and perform the Duties of their Profession, without any Limitation, since the same Article Grants thus much, restoring both the Ministers and School-Masters, even those which were Banish'd, annulling their Deeds of Reversion. That as many Churches and Chappels, (whose Members are not reconciled to the Church of Rome, and have been Built by the Protestants,) as stand in the said Coun∣ties be restor'd to us, to Exercise our Reli∣gion in them, according to the intent of the aforesaid 26th Article. That according to the intention of the so often mention'd 26th Article, the Pro∣testants of the said Counties, be discharg'd from paying any thing to the Catholick Curats, and oblig'd only to entertain their own Ministers. Lastly, That any Protestant of whatso∣ever State and Condition, not excluding the Peasants (according to these words of the 25th Article, to every one and every where,) may freely Exercise his Religion without being compelled to contrary Ce∣remonies; and that neither of the Parties presume to disturb any way, the other under the pain mention'd in the said Ar∣ticle. Besides, the foregoing Demands wherein the County of Sachsag joyns with the other Counties, by a particular Right granted in the Articles, the same County of Sachsag requires, that all the seized Churches be restor'd to the Protestants, which were in their Possession when the Article was made. The Grievance of the City of Gyongyos. THis City complains, that whereas according to the express Grant of the 26th Article, of the Diet of Sopron in these words: But in other Counties, viz. in those of Salavar, Vesprim, &c. and Geves (in which this City stands) since the Prote∣testants are actually in Possession of almost all the Churches there, &c. Item, Finally the Churches, which are actually possessed by those of the Helvetian Confession, and of that of Ausbourg, shall be still for their use, &c.
It should have been left in the actual Possession, and use of all the Protestant Churches, Parishes and Schools which were quietly possessed by the Protestants, before and after the Diet of Sopron to the Date underwritten; yet to the great Con∣tempt of His Imperial Majesty's, and of the Article's Grant, and to the great pre∣judice of the Protestants Right, by Order and Commission of the most Reverend Archbishop of Gran, and of the Right Honourable George Earl of Erdody, not only the Churches, but also the Schools and Parishes with all their Appurtenances (consisting in Eleven Vineyards, Five Mills, One Butcher's Stall, and a House which had all been given by Protestants in their Wills, or Purchased with the Protestants Money,) were seized by force on the 21st of May, in the year 1688 last past, by the Honourable Jean Almassy of Heves, and Francis Setuitter of Pesth, Judges of the same Counties; moreover the Protestant Ministers and School-masters were Banish'd, the Free Exercise of Religion even in pri∣vate Houses is forbidden, as well as the use of Bells and Burials in proper places, the Protestants being strictly Commanded to Bury their Dead in remote High-ways and Commons, where all the Filth of the Towns is carried: Therefore they lawfully Demand a full Restitution of all that has been taken from them, and an exact Exe∣cution of the aforesaid Article. The Grievance of the City of Moramoruss. THe Protestant Citizens and Inhabi∣tants, together with the Militia of Moramoruss complain, that altho' by Vertue of the 26th Article of Sopron, (wherein the same City of Moramoruss is expresly, named,) they had obtain'd the liberty of exercising publickly their Religion, and of having Churches, Parishes and Schools; and have quietly enjoyed the same with∣out giving any offence to the Catholicks, until the fatal breaking out of the Wars in the year 1683, and the unexpected Burning of the Town, which occasion'd an inter∣ruption of the said Exercise of Religion, the Ministers and their Parishioners having been forced to disperse themselves up and down; yet since the Troubles are appeased, they desire in vain to reassume their publick exercise of Religion, and to call back their Ministers, being hinder'd from the same by the Earl of Hoffkirchen Governour of this Territory, who every day growing severer, forbids with greater Threats, the total Ex∣ercise of the Protestant Religion: Nay, three Months ago the Roman Catholicks did Pro∣claim with the Beat of Drums, that no Protestant should presume to go out of the Territory of Moramoruss, to any Neigh∣bouring, to perform the Duties of his Re∣ligion; nor Exercise it in his private House under pain of Imprisonment, and of other severe Punishments. Therefore they Hum∣bly beg, That this their Grievance may be redressed, and they re-established in the Privilege granted by the Article. It may be added to the foregoing Grie∣vances, that one Samuel Bizkey, a Prote∣stant Minister of a place of Lower Hun∣gary called Hedes; notwithstanding the Pro∣tection granted to him by the Council of War, has been Plunder'd twice of all the means of Life, Clothes, Books and Furni∣ture, by some Emissaries of the Archbishop of Gran; and at last on the 22d of the last Month of March, was taken and carried to Presburg, into the Prisons of the Arch∣bishop, where he has nothing allowed him, but dry Bread and dirty Water. Likewise, the Protestant Minister of Tott∣falu in Upper Hungary, has been taken by a Jesuit called Father Ravasz, residing at Naghybania, and carried in Fetters into the Prisons of Zatmar, where he is still de∣tain'd and most barbarously used. The XXI. Article of the Diet of Pres∣burg, in the year 1687, in the busi∣ness of Religion, the 25th and 26th Articles of the year 1681, are re∣new'd with the inserted Decleration. ALthough they of the Helvetian Con∣fession, and of that of Ausbourg, by their protesting against the 25th and 26th Articles, of the late Diet of Sopron, have unworthily abused the same, and thereby forfeited ipso facto, the benefits granted in them; nevertheless since His most Sacred Majesty tending the Union; and the general quiet of the Kingdom, through his great Favour and Clemency, has most Graciously resolved, that the said Articles shall yet be in force; the States have Order'd, That the same shall be lookt upon as renewed and reinforced, (notwith∣standing the opposition of the Catholick Clergy, and other secular Persons,) and that as far as they have hitherto been in∣fringed through Abuses, introduced by the one, or the other party, they shall forth∣with be put in Execution. To these Agrievances the Emperor re∣turned a very Gracious Answer, and made several Proposals tending to a Peace. And First, He offer'd a General Pardon unto all, even to Tekeli himself, provided
he would personally appear to make his Submission. Secondly, That every Person should be restor'd to his Lands, and Goods confisca∣ted again restor'd. Thirdly, That free exercise of Religion should be allowed; but the manner how, and the Regulation thereof should be de∣termined at a General Diet, which was judged of absolute necessity for the repose, and quiet of Hungary. Fourthly, That all the vacant Offices, Governours and Balliages of that Kingdom, should be indifferently conferr'd upon Hun∣garian Gentlemen, who were capable by their Natural parts, and Abilities to Merit and Discharge such Preferments. And Lastly, That his Imperial Majesty would vacate the Office of Vice-King, and return to the ancient constitution of a Pa∣latine, whose Election should be free ac∣cording to the usage of former times. The Plague which still Raged in Austria, and Hungary prevented the proceedings of this Treaty, which might have taken ef∣fect some time before,How the Treaty was broken off. and answer'd all the Demands of the Malecontents; but now so much Blood had been drawn in all Parts, and Corners of that unhappy Kingdom, that it was past the Art of Man to stanch the Bleeding: And besides, Tekeli and his Malecontents were so nearly adjoyn'd, and engaged in secret Leagues, and Alliances with the Turk, that it was almost impossi∣ble to destricate, and disentangle them∣selves from the invitations they had made, and from the Assurances, and Pledges they had given to the Turks. Howsoever, the Emperor not to leave any means unattemp∣ted, until all was become desperate, dis∣patched Count Esterhasi into Hungary in quality of his Plenipotentiary, to put those Overtures into Execution which had been fram'd, and debated in the Emperor's Council. But whilst these things were in agitation, they received another Impedi∣ment, by a discovery made of a Correspon∣dence, which several Principal Officers held with the Maleconts; upon which Filek, and two other Councellors, and Mannagers of the Revenue of Hungary were Arrested, and accused of having moved, and promoted an Insurrection in divers Counties. Towards the end of this year, when the Armies were drawn into their Winter quarters, new Treaties were set on foot. The Baron de Kaunitz the Emperor's Resi∣dent at Constantinople labour'd to conti∣nue,Kaunitz Treats with the Grand Seignior. and renew the Truce; but the Grand Vizier would not agree thereunto on any other Terms, than that it might be allow∣able for the Grand Seignior to afford aid, and assistance to the Malecontents: But this was to cure a Soar with a greater Evil, and what was inconsistent with Reason, to make a Peace, and yet to continue a War. When the Emperor believed all Accomo∣dation with the Malecontents impossible, at least far distant; Behold on a suddain, and much unexpected, the Counts Tekeli,Tekeli and others of∣fer Condi∣tions. Pestrozzi and Wessellino in despight of their Engagements to the Turks, offer'd to make Terms by themselves; and to abandon their People and their Cause, in case they as∣sented not thereunto; The Conditions were to have all their Churches restor'd, with their Goods and Estates, which had been Confiscated: To which the Emperor readily assenting, there never appear'd at any time a greater probability and likely∣hood of an Agreement, than upon this o∣verture: But whereas to establish and con∣firm such an Accomodation, it was neces∣sary to convene a Diet, which by reason of the present Contagion could not be done, a Cessation of Arms was in the mean time concluded: But whilst in order thereunto a Conference was held at Tokai, Count Caprara unluckily march'd out of his Quar∣ters with a considerable force towards that place;Is again broken. upon which the Malecontens were so Allarum'd, that they Sallied out of their Winter quarters in great numbers, leaving the Treaty imperfect, and the Cessation of Arms broken and violated. ANNO 1681. Notwithstanding the unlucky Accidents which had happen'd to hinder, and disap∣point the Progress of the aforesaid Treaties; Yet at the beginning of this year new over∣tures were made to the Malecontents by the Bishop Sebestini: And tho' some of the most considerable Persons of the Hunga∣rian party, refused to hearken to any Of∣fers which the Emperor should make them; yet Tekeli, and others,Tekeli and other chiefs send Depu∣ties to Lintz. formerly the most averse to all Accommodation, did now at least in a seeming manner favour the Me∣thods which tended towards Peace; and in order thereunto, did not only dis∣patch Deputies as far as to Lintz, to Treat thereupon with the Imperial Ministers; but likewise entertain'd a personal Confer∣ence with Count Caprara, and agreed with him to continue a Truce until the result of a Diet should be known, which was to con∣vene in the Month of Febuary. That which in all appearance was most probable to administer the greatest difficul∣ty, and cause of dispute, when a Diet should assemble, was the restitution of the Churches, Schools, and other Foundations which the Malecontents challenged as their own, and upon the Right, and Title of
having Erected, and Built them at their own charge and expence. They were also very positive to have their ancient Govern∣ment by a Palatine restor'd, and all the German Garrisons withdrawn out of Hun∣gary, at least, that the Officers placed over the German Forces should be Hungarians, the better to keep the Souldiers within some Terms of Moderation, and Good Be∣haviour towards the People of the Country. The time appointed for the Diet to meet being come, the Emperor remov'd to New∣stadt, to be nearer to the place of Treaty. But it being the Fate of that poor King∣dom to be unhappy, something or other still intervened to prevent and disappoint the Endeavours of Peace;A Plot to seize Tekeli du∣ring the Truce. for whilst some labour'd in that good Work, others made it their business to impede and divert it. And so it was at present; for whilst Tekeli was delighting himself at a House of Plea∣sure, a Plot was laid to surprize and take him during the Truce; of which Tekeli having notice,How it was pre∣vented. he countermined the Plot by an Ambuscade; which being oppor∣tunely disposed in the way where they were to pass, the Party which came to seize him was totally defeated. This, and other Artifices of the like nature, foment∣ed jealousies and diffidences between the Parties, that nothing was acted clearly, and with a free Spirit, but with such Cau∣tion and reserves, as easily presaged the little hopes of an accommodation by way of Treaty. Howsoever, some Zealous Men, such as Esterhasi, and Forgatz, who were passionate for the peace of their Country, travel'd from County to County, exhorting the People to lay aside all Animosities,Esterhasi and For∣gatz make offers of Peace. and return again unto that Allegiance and Duty which they ow'd unto their Prince; upon assu∣rance that the Emperor would restore the State of Hungary to the same Condition in which it was in the year 1662. and grant almost all the other Propositions which the Malecontents did demand; provided that the States of that Kingdom would de∣clare the Arch-Duke Joseph, Son to the Em∣peror, King of Hungary. To this Proposal the Malecontents were ready also to condescend; on Condition, that at the same time the Kingdom were declar'd Elective, and some Acts repeal'd, which in the year 1664 had made it He∣reditary. Notwithstanding this difficulty, and di∣vers others which were daily started, dis∣pleasing to the Emperor, the Meeting of a Diet at Oedemburg was so warmly press'd, that the Emperor's Commissioners, and fourteen Deputies from the Malecontents Assembled in the Month of February, as was agreed, tho' Tekeli refus'd to be there present, alledging that the late Treacherous Design against his Person, was a sufficient and a just Excuse for his Absence. This, and some Dispute about the place of Meet∣ing (which the Imperialists desired might be at Presburg) occasion'd a Prorogation of the Diet until April next following.The Diet prorogued until Aprll. In the mean time the Malecontents held their Consultations in Transilvania, concerning the Measures and Methods they were to take in the next Campaign; and made use of the cessation of Arms, to fortifie their Garrisons, and supply them with Provisions. The Clergy of Hungary finding in the Emperor a Spirit so inclin'd unto Peace, that he was ready to condescend unto all the Demands of the Malecontents; and with the rest, to grant and yield unto them all the Churches, of which they had been depriv'd; they being touch'd with a sense of the mischief which might accrue to themselves thereby,The Clergy endeavour to disturb the Diet. sent their Deputies to Vienna before the Convention of the Diet, to represent unto the Emperor the great prejudice, damage and scandal he would cause to the Catholick Religion, by delivering up the Churches, which were already Consecrated, and Hallowed to the Service of God, to be prophaned by Im∣pious and Heretical Worships. This, and such like Speeches serv'd to trouble and di∣stract the Mind of the good Emperor with a thousand new Scruples. Howsoever, be∣ing desirous to appease the Troubles in Hungary, and not disappoint that August Assembly, His Imperial Majesty (a full Month before the Convention) remov'd to Newstadt, to be near, and on all Occasions to be assistant to the Diet; which, notwith∣standing the former Disputes to the con∣trary, was to be held at Oedemburg.The Depu∣ties jealous of the Em∣perors Guards. But whereas the Emperor was attended with three Regiments for his Guard, the Ap∣pearance seem'd so extraordinary on such an Occasion, that the Malecontents re∣fus'd to send their Deputies, fearing to be over-aw'd in their Debates and Votes by a Military power; unless the Arch-bishop of Strigonium, and other German Lords were first deliver'd into their hands for Hostages, and Security of fair and faithful Dealings; But to remove this difficulty, the Empe∣ror discharged his Regiments; and with a Guard only of six hundred Hungarians,The Empe∣ror enters into Oe∣demberg, and holds the Diet. made his Entry on the two and twentieth of May into Oedemburg, where he was receiv'd between the double Files of Hungarian and German Soldiers, and Conducted to the Lodgings prepar'd for him by the Commis∣sioners and Deputies there present The Diet, over which Count Swartzem∣burg presided in the Name of the Emperor,
had sat several days before his Majesty's Arrival. And on the first day of the Ses∣sion, before they would enter upon any other Business, the Election of a Palatine was propos'd, and three Persons were No∣minated thereunto, viz. Esterhasi, Palfi, and Erdedi; and accordingly were offer'd to the Emperor to make choice of the Per∣son which he thought most worthy,A Palatine offer'd. and agreeable to that high Employment, and Office of Trust. But whereas this Prince was entirely in the hands, and possess'd by Father Emeric, lately made Arch-bishop of Vienna, and Abelé the Secretary, he re∣fus'd to determine the Choice, until such time as he had consulted with these two Confidents thereupon. By this Retardment, all other Matters mov'd slowly, tho' the Diet sate eight hours every day. The least point Administer'd matter of Dispute,Affairs ob∣structed. and what at the first appearance seem'd easie and of little im∣portance, was render'd difficult and intri∣cate, by reason of the Spirit of Dissention and Bitterness with which that whole As∣sembly was possess'd. And moreover Fa∣ther Emeric excepting against every Person which the Diet propos'd for Palatine, gave a stop to all Proceedings, that the Assembly was upon dissolving; and Prince Swartzem∣burg became so tired and wearied with the many unprofitable and fruitless endeavours, that he deliver'd up his Commission to, Count Capeliers, Superintendant of the Council of War, to preside in his Place. And so restless were the Soldiers, and difficult to be restrain'd from breaking out into Acts of Hostility, that during the Ces∣sation of Arms, a Party of the Malecontents fell upon a Regiment of the Imperialists and cut them in pieces. Howsoever the Diet still continued, and the Emperor at length, with the Advice of his two Favourites,Count E∣sterhasi made Pa∣latine. pitch'd upon Count Esterhasi to bear the Office of Palatine in Hungary; to whom having administer'd the Oath of Allegiance, and Fidelity, he return'd back again to Newstadt. The next day following, the Diet receiv'd a Letter Signed by Count Tekeli, and six others, signifying their Resolutions to accept the Pardon, and submit to the Emperor: Provided that they might have a free exercise of their Religion granted, their Churches and Estates which were confiscated, restor'd; and the Money which they had engaged to pay the Turk, supply'd, and paid for them by the Emperor.A new Pro∣position made by Tekeli. And that for perfor∣mance of the Articles, some means and ex∣pedients should be found out for a satisfa∣ctory Security. This Letter was immedi∣ately dispatched to the Emperor, who with his Council, considering thereupon, abso∣lutely rejected the new Article relating to the Turks, to whom it was resolved to make no payments of Money: Of which answer Tekeli being inform'd, he dispatch'd a Mes∣sage immediately unto Count Caprara, giving him to understand, that he was no longer able to contain his Soldiery within the Rules, and Laws of the Truce, and so without farther delay seized upon two Pas∣ses between Cassovia and Tokai: And to put Matters yet more backwards; the De∣puties who represented the Malecontents at the Diet, made a Petition to the Emperor, requesting him, that he would be graciously pleas'd, to remove out of his Councils and Offices of Trusts all such, as have had any hand, or been instrumental in promoting those Troubles and Civil dissentions, which had now near the space of Twenty years infested and oppress'd that unhappy King∣dom: But to this Demand the Emperor made no other answer, Than that he would consider it. By these motions and steps in the Diet towards a Peace, the Turks conceiv'd a Jealousy, that Tekeli was dispo∣sed and inclined to an Accommodation with the Emperor:  To prevent which a Pasha was order'd to discourse and tamper with him,The Turks jealous of Tekeli. and offer him the Principality of Transilvania after the Death of Apafi: And entertaining also frequent Conferences with him and other Leaders of the Malecontents, the Pasha so mannaged his Discourse with them, by declaring the many advantages, they would receive by covering and shroud∣ing themselves, under protection of the Grand Seignior;Their offers to him. that he prevailed upon them to make an offer of Eighty thousand Crowns, in case the Grand Seignior would promise to assist them with a Puissant and Royal Army. The Emperor upon notice of this private and perfidious Treaty with the Turk, was highly incensed, and com∣manded that neither Tekeli,Tekeli for∣bid the Diet. nor any of those who were concern'd in this Confe∣rence, should be admitted as Members in∣to the Diet: And giving it now for grant∣ed, that a War would ensue with the Turk, the Marquis of Baden was ordered to For∣tify Raab, and Count Staremberg to finish the Fortifications of Vienna, from the Ar∣senal of which place great quantities of Granadoes, Bombs, Powder, with Arms, and heavy Cannon were transported down the Danube, to supply that Important For∣tress of Raab. Notwithstanding all which, the Deputies continued to labour in the Diet, and to ex∣amin the Aggrievances of the Malecontents; and the Palatine Esterhasi made frequent Journies between Oedemburg, and Newstadt to render an Account of all Passages, and Transactions to the Emperor: And that a
conclusion might be put to all matters in question; the Archbishop of Vienna went to the Diet, to agree certain differences arisen between the Clergy and the Laity of Hungary, touching the Title to some Lands and Demesnes, which was still depending in a Law Suit between them.Acts made at the Diet. After this Point was agreed, the whole Result of the Diet was drawn up in Writing, and sent to Tekeli; the Substance whereof was this, That all the Churches which the Prote∣stants had Built at their own charge and expence should be restor'd; with free Li∣cense to Erect and Build more, in any part of the Kidgdom, and therein to exercise their Religion, and publickly to Preach. That a considerable Sum of Mony should be paid to the Turks for once and no more, but not by way of Tribute: Provided that the Truce made in the year 1664, be again renewed for twenty years longer, under the same Articles and Conditions: And farther, several expedients and means were agreed for raising Monies for pay∣ment of the Troops, and defraying the charges of the Kingdom, during these times of trouble. To confirm all which Tekeli was desired to appear at the Diet (notwith∣standing the late Prohibition) and to con∣cur with the other Deputies by Signing these Articles:Tekeli cal∣led to the Diet. And lest he should make the insecurity of his Person an excuse for his Non-appearance, the Son of Count Esterhasi the Palatine, was offer'd for a Hostage.  These Proposals were carried to Tekeli by the Secretary to the Palatine, who return'd from him in the Month of July, unto the Diet still Sitting at Oedem∣burg; with an answer to this effect; That Tekeli would not be satisfied with less, than an entire restitution of all the Churches: That one single Sum of what value soever would not content the Turks,Tekeli's answer. who requir'd an Annual Tribute of 40.000 Rix Dollars, without which they refused to restore to the Malecontents their Wives, and Chil∣dren which they had given in Hostage: And moreover, this Messenger gave them to understand, that Tekeli absolutely refu∣sed to appear at the Diet, and that He, and his Party were not satisfied with the Election of Esterhasi to be Palatine. This answer was the cause of much Debate and Division in the Diet; and their Minds and Councils were farther disturbed upon the News, that the Forces of the Malecontents being joyn'd with a considerable Body both of Turks and Transilvanians, were become 15.000 strong; that the Pasha of Waradin kept so close a Correspendence with the Malecontents, that it was more than pro∣bable, that their interest and alliances were so firmly united, that neither Party was at liberty to make Terms, or Articles of Peace without the Assent, or Concurrence of the other. The truth of which soon appear'd; for Tekeli not long afterwards marched near the Confines of Belgrade,Tekeli joins with the Turks. where he joyned with a Body of 20.000 Turks; and thereby gave evident Demon∣strations of his Resolution to maintain the War, and that his former proposals, and steps towards Peace, were all false and feigned, with design to Amuse the Minds of the Emperor and the Diet. The Turks had not as yet declar'd a War, for their Forces and Troops from the remote parts of Asia were not in a readiness, nor on their March; till which time the Emperor was to be amused with Treaties, and the appearance of that great Body of Turks near Belgrade, was with pretension only to restore Tekeli to the Possession of his Lands, Houses, and Estate, of which he had been unjustly deprived by the Emperor, and his Favourites. The Emperor finding it now absolutely necessary to conclude an Accommodation with the Malecontents, amongst whom new difficulties daily arose, returned in Person from Newstadt to the Diet at Oedemburg, where the Malecontents thought it reasona∣ble, that the Tribute which they had en∣gaged to pay unto the Turks, should be charged and levied on the Estates of those, who had been the causes of the Troubles, and Confusions in that Kingdom. This motion had so little ground, and was so unlikely to succeed, that it put all things backwards; and induced the Emperor to limit the Session of the Diet to the 16th of August, hoping within that time to agree on all Points with such, who continued constant in their Loyalty and Allegiance to him; and for particular Aggrievances, they were to be composed by a Select Com∣mittee appointed for that purpose. But all this while most of the Protestants refused to come to the Diet, by reason that the Points about Religion were post-poned, by the endeavours of the Archbishop of Stri∣gonium, which they in the first place, and before all other Matters desir'd to have de∣cided. This Point being laid aside, the Diet fell to debate on the Proposition sent by Tekeli, relating to a Tribute demanded by the Turks; and as an expedient, and by way of Equivalent for that, it was proposed to resign into the Hands of the Turks three Counties, viz. Kalo, Zatmar and Liptpow; to which the Turks seemed with some rea∣son to claim a Title, in regard, that no longer than since the year 1660, they had been disjoyn'd from the Principality of Tran∣silvania. But an end was soon put to this
Controversie; for both the Hungarians themselves were unwilling to have a Peace purchased from the Turk at the price of their Country, by dismembring three Coun∣ties from that Kingdom; at the mentioning only of which the People were so enraged, that fearing lest the Emperor should pri∣vately conclude some Article with the Turk in reference thereunto, they would not be satisfied until he had permitted them to joyn one of their Confidents with Ca∣prara, the Emperor's Resident at Constanti∣nople, who might be privy to all the Trea∣ties, and Negotiations with the Turk; nor would the Turks accept thereof in satisfa∣ction for renewing the Truce, but raised new and greater Demands, as they found the Emperor inclinable to yield and con∣descend:The Turks raise their Demands. For now the Grand Vizier requi∣red to have Leopolstadt demolish'd, on pretence that it had been Built, and Forti∣fied contrary to the Articles of the late Treaty: And declar'd likewise the Grand Seignior's resolution, to give aid and as∣sistance to the Malecontents, until such time, as he had put them into a capacity of paying the Annual Tribute, for which they were engaged. New difficulties were every day started at the Diet, so that the Emperor was de∣sirous to dissolve it, so soon as was possi∣ble; but yet he thought not fit to do it abruptly, or to break it up in discontent; but that something might be done in mat∣ters of Religion,The Empe∣ror Grants several matters. on which the Protestants most insisted: In order unto which it was agreed, to grant them a hundred Churches, with Money to build others, in places most convenient. That all Cities and Towns, should enjoy a free exercise of their Religion: And that all Hungarian Soldiers in the Frontier Garrisons should do the like. That all Churches which since the year 1670, had been in the Possession of either Party, should so remain. That Lutherans and Calvinists might build Churches in any Town, or City where they were wanting, and Lords and Gentlemen might build Chappels, or Orato∣ries in any of their Houses, or Castles. That in case any Points of Difference should arise relating to Religion, or the Matters preceeding, they were not to be decided by the Sword, but by the Sentence of the King of Hungary. And that all People of what Perswasion soever might live amicably, no Person was to Revile the other on account of his or their Reli∣gion, or to utter injurious or unhansome Terms thereof. These particulars with some additional Regulations, being at last agreed in the Diet, and sign'd by the Emperor; The next great work was, in what manner the Malecontents might be restor'd to their Estates, and to their Goods which had been confiscated: And how the German Troops,Aggrie∣vances con∣sidered. and stranger Soldiers might with safety and ease be removed out of their Garrisons, and all parts of Hungary; which next to the business of Religion, was the greatest con∣cernment of the Diet. The next Aggrie∣vance was the Chamber of the Kingdom, which Office, contrary to the will and ap∣probation of the Deputies of the States, was executed by the Bishop of Newstadt, whom they consider'd as the Chief Au∣thor, and Fomenter of all the Troubles of that Kingdom: But herein, the Emperor was not willing as yet to gratify the Diet. Nor could the Deputies agree amongst themselves of the manner, how to make those things practicable, which they in the most erarnest manner desir'd: And such were the Divisions amongst them, that what the Seculars agreed upon in the Morning, was disturbed, and undone by the Clergy in the Afternoon; which the Emperor well considering, and how Men of such dif∣ferent interests perplex all Councils; was pleased to dismiss the Archbishop of Strigo∣nium, and the Bishop of Newstadt, as also the Count Capliers, a great stickler for the Rights of the Church, from their atten∣dance on the Diet; so that the Imperial Commissioners were reduced to three Per∣sons, namely the Prince of Swartzemburg, the Count of Nostiz, and Oker the Chan∣cellour. And farther,The Empe∣ror satisfies the Male∣contents. to satisfy the Male∣contents in their pretensions, the Bishop of Newstadt, was put by his Office of Vice-President of the Chamber of Hungary, and the same was conferr'd on Count Erdedi, a Person much more acceptable to the Peo∣ple. This gracious Clemency and Compli∣ance of the Emperor, was so satisfactory to the Protestants, that they wholly submit∣ted that point about the confiscated Goods to the favour, and benign inclinations of his Imperial Majesty, who not to abuse that confidence which his Subjects reposed in him, did freely, and of his own accord, give order, that the Goods, and Estates of the Counts Serini, Nadasti, and Frangipani, with those of several other Lords, that had been confiscated for High Treason, should be restor'd again to their Children or Heirs. And the States on the other side to demon∣strate the Gratitude and Duty which they professed unto their Prince, did in Testimo∣ny thereof, make a Present unto the Em∣press of a Purse of Gold, containing 2000 Ducats, which her Majesty graciously re∣ceived; and bestow'd the same towards Reparations of the Catholick Churches,
which by reason of the Wars, and other Troubles of the Kingdom, were become ruinous and decayed: Which if the Pro∣testants had fore-seen, 'tis probable, they would have employ'd the Money rather for Reparation of their own Churches, than to those of their Adversaries. Thus the chief Points of Difference being ami∣cably concluded, and sign'd by the Empe∣ror,The Diet dissolved. the Diet was dissolved the 29th of December 1681. after which the Emperor with his Court return'd to Vienna. But these Treaties and Agreements were so imperfect and so little observed, by rea∣son of the Wars with the Turks, Parties and Factions breaking out every day, and continual Skirmishes disannulling the Ar∣cles concluded; nothing could be built hereupon, nor the Agreement take the least effect, nor so much as regarded, until the year 1689. when the Turks Suing for a Peace, the Protestants made the following Address to His Imperial Majesty as follow∣eth, The which I have inserted here for the sake of the Reader, and the easiness in understanding this History.

Contra VII. Commissiones Regiae tamen in Comitatibus plurimis, uti etiam Honthensi, qui unus esset ex praescriptis enumeratis, om∣nia Templa mediante Vicecomite illius Comi∣tatus

Pariter fecerunt in Abavyvariensi, Zempliniensi, Bereghiensi Comitatibus, in Bonis, ut praememoratum, Universis Rakoc∣zianis Officiales ejusdem Dominii, ac in Oppido Gyóngyós, quod ipsum potiorem partem Comi∣tatus Heves constitueret, nonnullae privatae personae Templum Helveticae Confessioni ad∣dictorum occupare, Ministros removere, imo totale exercitium Religionis suae iisdem serio inhibere praesumserunt: Nec absimiliter etiam in Oppido Jaszbreny & confinio Legrad proces∣sum. Esto, quod hi recensiti Comitatus es∣sent de numero illorum, qui juxta Articulum in possessione omnium prae manibus habitorum Templorum relicti sunt. Contra VIII.

Similiter Carponae per Regiam Commissionem, & Tho∣kaini per Deputatos, locis licet Articularibus nomine tenus specificatis inhibitum exercitium, & Templa occupata. Contra IX.

Contra X.

Comitatu Honthensi & Oppido Gyógyós. Prae∣terea in eodem Oppido Gyóngyós nonnullae pri∣vatae personae omnes proventus, & pia legata ab Evangelicis abstraxerunt, Sepulturas in locis competentibus inhibuerunt, adeo ut com∣plures in Cellariis demortuos suos longo tem∣pore asservare necessitati fuerint, ad funera∣tionem despectuosam quadriviorum & compoto∣rum relegati existentes. Campanarum etiam liberum usum fere ubique per Regnum eaedem Commissiones Evangelicis interdixerunt. His similia aeque in Comitatu Zempliniensi, ac signanter in praementionati Dominij Rakoczi ani Oppidis, Thalia, Mad, Szantho, Kereszthur, Tarczel, Liszka, Bennye, Tolezva, Patak, Vyhally, Borssy & Tokai, nominatis, Officiales ejusdem Dominii patrarunt, quippe qui Univer∣sis dictorum oppidorum Templis (in quorum actuali Dominio tam tempore conditi hujus Ar∣ticuli, quam expost etiam fuissent, de caeteroque prae possessione eorundem ad mentem Articuli imperturbatè relinqui debuissent.) cum eorundem proventibus per Evangelicos collatis, Paro∣chiis item ac Scholis violenter occupatis liberum Religionis eorundem exercitium, vel in pri∣vata etiam domo usuandum severissimis sub minis inhibuerunt, ac etiam Campanarum per eos∣dem Oppidanos Evangelicos fieri curatarum, prout & Sepulturae communem usum planè non admittendum interdixerunt; sic Epperiensis & Cassoviensis civitatum Evangelicis quoad pro∣ventus Ecclesiasticos omnia pia legata per Magistratum loci & clerum sunt via facti erepta; quibus insimul Campanarum & Sepulturae communis usus absolutissimè denegatur. Funerum porro intra moenia Civitatum cum solitis cantibus & ceremoniis conveniens & publica deductio severa cum comminatione cavetur & non admittitur. Contra XI. Commissiones verò ubique in Comitatibus Plebanis Catholicis omnes soluti∣ones addixerunt. In Civitatibus autem, ut ex Fisco, seu Communi Civitatis aerario (ad quem respectu pluralitatis & majoris numeri Evangelicorum Catholici minimum quantum contribuerent) Plebanis solutio fiat, prae∣scripserunt Nos, ut nostratibus tam Ministris, quam Scholae docentibus, extraordinariè ex propriis prospiciamus, manifestè tam contra praescriptos Articulos, quam etiam mentem Sacrae Scripturae, laborantibus solum mercedem tribuentis; non laborantibus verò nec man∣ducare debere inventis, invitos cogendo. Offi∣ciales identidem saepe allegati Dominij Ra∣gocziani in superiori Hungaria, assumto quo∣que brachio Militari, ad solutionem Plebanis Catholicis in eodem dominio pendendam citra discrimen, Nobiles pariter & ignobiles incolas Evangelicos omni conatu adigunt. Contra XII. Commissiones verò in plerisque Comitatibus, signanter autem Lyptoviensi, Thu∣roczensi, Zoliensi, Arvensi, & aliis (licet à tempore occupatorum Templorum in usu & praxi talis exercitij in Residentiis Nobilitari∣bus Articulariter permissi longo tempore prae∣fuissent) abrogarunt, & sub poena militaris invasionis residentiae similis nobilis, inhibue∣runt.
Prouti expost in Comitatu Lyptoviensi Domini Plebani ibidem per milites Likavien∣ses aliquot talium Nobilium domos invadi & expilari fecissent. Et proximè in Trenchi∣miensi Comitatu Nobiles familiae Nosdroviczky Praedicantem in residentia sua pro administratione exercitij sui intertenentes similiter per mi∣lites Regiminis Morssiani damnificati, & idem Minister ad carceres Arcis Lednicze raptatus nunc quoque ibidem detinetur. In insula Czalokóz Nobiles Hodossienses & circumjacentium locorum similiter à residentiali Religionis suae cultu prohibiti sunt, & Ministri ibidem exi∣stentis eo tum omnes res direptae sunt. Quam injuriam inferiorum quoque Hungariae par∣tium Nobiles Evangelici non sine lamentis querulantur. Utinam Conclusio haec observaretur, & ad desumtionem à Contravenientibus designatae poenae Articularis procederetur, pacificam om∣nino & imperturbatam nostri in libero Evan∣gelico Exercitio permansionem nobis polliceri possemus, tollereturque formidine poenae omnis fomes discordiarum.

Most Sacred, Imperial, and Royal Majesty: Most Gracious Sir, ALthough we have already made it appear to Your most Sacred Majesty, and to the Ministers of Your most Imperial Court, that many Injustices were done to us in the Year 1681, against the clear and evident Grants of the 25th and 26th Articles of Sopron, Humbly solliciting this full Year and a Half the Observation of the same, and the Redressing of the Grievances of our Evangelical Religion; yet, because it is daily Reported, that by Virtue of Your Majesty's Commissions appointed last Year, and before through Hungary nothing was Ordered, against the full intent of the said Articles, and that we desire more than is granted in them: We thought it our Duty to justify both our Complaints and our repeated Requests, (the reather because the Worthy Ministers of Your Imperial Court have often assur'd us, that without any delay or difficulty, we should be maintain'd in the clear Grants of the said Articles of Sopron,) in order to which we shall set down here, as in a kind of Table, the very words of the said Articles, together with our Requests, against the Misintepretation of the said Articles, either by Your Majesty's Commissioners, or by other Persons under pretence of fulfiling the same, and the Decisions made thereupon, by that means we shall shew Evidently that the said Articles were Infring'd to our great prejudice, and that our Requests are most Just. The XXV ARTICLE runs thus: AND because his Majesty intending the Peace and general Quiet of the Kingdom was pleased also to come to a Gracious Resolution upon the business of Religion, therefore the States of the King∣dom insert the said Resolution in the Arti∣cles. I. And Principally, whereas the free exercise of Religion (granted in the year 1606. by virtue of the Peace of Vienna) has been disturbed in part during these Troubles; therefore (the first Article of the said Peace being hereby confirm'd) the same free exercise of Religion is granted to every Person, and every where in the Kingdom; according to the first Article made before the Coronation in the year 1608. Provided that the Privileges of Lords of Manors be not hereby prejudiced. Hereupon we require in the Article's own words, that the same free exercise of Reli∣gion (as was disturbed in part during the Troubles, and before the Troubles did in∣clude Evangelical Ministers or Preachers) be granted to every Person, and every where in the Kingdom, not excepting the free Cities, Towns and Villages, which make the fourth State, since they are expresly comprehended in the aforesaid Article made before the Coronation in the Year 1608. II. A free Return in the Kingdom, and a free exercise of Religion is granted also to all the Ministers and School-masters, that are
either Banish'd or Kept out of their Employ∣ments, by reason of certain Deeds of Rever∣sion, the same Deeds being hereby made void and of no effect. From thence it follows evidently, that the Ministers and Schoolmasters are to be restor'd from their Exile to their respective Professions, and may live freely in any City, Town or Village of the Kingdom, per∣forming the Duties of their Religion and Profession, and that no more Deeds of Re∣version can be requir'd from them, since such Deeds are condemned in the Article. III. And no Hungarian Subject shall be disturbed any way hereafter in the free Exercise of his Religion. These words, no Hungarian Subject ex∣clude undoubtedly any Exception; the mean∣ing plainly is, that no Ecclesiastical or Ci∣vil Person, no Nobleman, no Citizen, nor Peasant ought to be disturbed in the free exercise of Religion, and no Body will deny, but that an exercise of Religion can in no sense be term'd free, unless there be Mini∣sters that officiate in it. IV. None of the Helvetian Confession, and of that of Ausburg, shall be compel∣led to any ceremony contrary to his Re∣ligion. The generality of these words, confirms the foregoing i. e. that no Nobleman, nor Gentleman, no Citizen nor Peasant ought to be compelled.
Proceedings of the King's Commis∣sioners contrary in every parti∣cular to the Articles of Sopron. AGainst the opposite first Article. The King's high Commissioners, or other private Persons employ'd by them, have for∣bidden such a free exercise of Religion, as could consist in the Service of God through Preaching, Singing, Praying, Administring the Sacraments, blessing Marriages, making Burials, and using other wonted Ceremonies, which were perform'd by Ecclesiastical Mini∣sters, in many free Royal Cities and Mountain Towns, namely in St. George, Bazinium, Tyrnaw, Zakoliza, Schemnizium, Vetero∣zolium, Carpen, Libeten, Breznow, Bakaw, Bela, Vibania, Kusseghin and Rust; where∣by it appears, That in those places the said Commissioners have supprest the whole exercise of Religion against the opposite Article; for where there is no Liberty for the above men∣tion'd Acts of Religion, there can be no ex∣ercise of Religion at all. They have likewise depriv'd the Inhabitants of all the Towns and Villages in the Counties, of the free ex∣ercise of their Religion, by Virtue of that Clause inserted for the destroying of our Re∣ligion, and of the Gospel too (provided that the Privileges of the Lords of Manors be not hereby prejudiced) against the Confirmation of the Article made in the Year 1608. Against the II. The said Commissioners have Licensed but two Ministers in each County, and but one or two in some Free Cities all
over the Kingdom, Banishing all the rest out of the Counties, some within a Fortnight and others within Three days; as in the Coun∣ties of Lypeze, of Orowa, of Owar, of Sachsag, of Zolnock and in others, or re∣quiring strict Deeds of Reversion from the same, if they would continue in the said Coun∣ties. They have also appointed, that there should be no petty Schools, but such where Children could learn only to Read and to Write. But what kind of Liberty it is, that hath been granted to our Ministers to profess their Religion; appears 1st, By the Record∣ed Banishment of a great many of them out of the Counties. 2ly, By the Case of the Ministers in Eperies, that have been turn'd out by a Roman Catholick Magistrate, under pretence that it was Your Majesty's Pleasure and Command, altho' that Town be particularly named in the Articles. 3ly, By the violence that the Official has done to the Ministers and School-masters, that liv'd but miserably in the Dominion of Tokai in Upper Hungary, intimating to them under pain of Death, and the Forfeiture of all their Goods, to go out of the said County, or by most strict Deeds of Reversion, to renounce for ever under the same penalty to perform any Ecclesiastical Duty in the said County. 4ly, By the Confinement of several Ministers, who are kept Prisoners in the Fort of Ledniche, by Order of his Eminence the Cardinal of Kolocza, and can obtain their Liberty on no other Condition, but that of subscribing pernicious Deeds of Reversion. Against the III. Here our Sighs interrupt our Complaints, nor can we find words to ex∣press how variously and miserably our Mini∣sters and we have been, and are still distur∣bed every where, either by the said Commis∣sioners, or by other private Persons. As for in∣stance in short, (not to repeat the abovemen∣tion'd Counties, and many Towns of the Coun∣ty of Semlyn, in the aforesaid Dominion of Tokai, and their Ministers) the above-men∣tion'd City of Epperies in Upper Hungary, and in the Lower all the Cities besides Pres∣burg, Sopron, Modra, Cremnicz and Neo∣zolium, with their Evangelical Ministers. As also the Minister of Hodossia in the Isle of Shut, who had all the means of Life, Clothes, Books and Furniture taken from him by the Secretary of the Archbishop of Gran, and by the Soldiers which he brought along with him, which is the Fate of a great many others, that lead a most miserable Life in perpetual Changes, owing their Liberty to a Special Providence of God, or having obtain'd it after they had paid great Fines, or made pernicious Deeds of Reversion. Against the IV. The said Commissioners have Order'd, that the Evangelicks should be made to bring their Processional Trophies, and to Walk in Processions, that the Evangelick Peasant should every where be forc'd to fre∣quent Catholick Churches; and that in all the Free Cities where there is no publick exer∣cise of our Religion, the Evangelick should be obliged to Ministerial Offices contrary to their way. Against the V. The said Commissioners having no regard to the Assignation appointed in the opposite Article, have seiz'd upon all the Churches and Chappels in the Counties of Lypcze, of Arva, of Turocz, of Zolnock
and of Sachsag, although the Churches of Pribocz, Bella and Zathuriza, in the County of Turocz have been Built by the Evange∣lick, who were never reconciled to the Catho∣lick Church; there are likewise Chappels in Kiratilehota, Potornia, Vicbicz, &c. in the County of Lypcze, that were Built by the Evangelicks and the Lords of those Manors; nevertheless, they are severely forbidden to make any use of them, either Ecclesiastical or Civil, being sent to two very remote incon∣venient and dangerous places, where they have only liberty to Build such Churches as cannot contain the Congregation by several Thousands. The XXVI. ARTICLE. V. MOreover the Churches (that have been Built by those of the Hel∣vetian Confession, and of that of Aus∣bourg, and whose Members are not yet reconciled to the Catholick Church) shall
be assign'd to them by certain Commissi∣oners. Hereupon we require, that those Chap∣pels and Churches be deliver'd and assign'd to us, whose Members are not yet reconci∣led to the Catholick Church, of which sort many would be found in the Counties of Lypcze, of Owar, &c. VI. It is order'd also, according to his Majesty's Gracious Resolution, that in other places the same Commissioners, as∣sign places to build Churches and Schools, and erect Parishes for the conveniency of those of the Helvetian Confession, and of that of Ausbourg. Hereupon we require, that instead of the inconvenient and undecnt places, which are assigned out of Cassovia and Esperies in Upper Hungary, others be appointed within the Walls, as also in all the Free and Royal Cities, where there is convenient and large espaces, since thus much is signifi'd by the words which will be set down lower Fig. 9. VII. But in other Counties, as in those of Salawar, of Vesprim, of Saraz, of Mora∣moruss, of Abavivar, of Sellia, of Sem∣lyn, of Ugoza, of Bodrogh, of Tornaw, of Komorra, of Barzod, of Sachsag, of No∣vigrad, of Zolnock, of Hewecz, of Pesth, Pe∣licz and Soldth united, of Unghwar, of Chege and of Zatmar; since the Evangelicks are actually in possession of almost all the Churches there, the same Churches are left for the use of the actual possessors of them. Hereupon we require, that the Evange∣licks may recover and undisturbedly pos∣sess all the Churches, which were possessed by them in the aforesaid Counties when the Article was made, and which for the most part are now taken from them against the said Article. VIII. The same is granted in the Fron∣tier Towns of the Kingdom, viz. to those of Zentgrod in the division near Canisa; of Tyhany, Vasony, Papa, Vesprim, Raab and Comorra, in the division of Raab; of Leva, Carpen and Tuletin, in the division before the Mountains; and of Putnock, Onod, Zendro, Tokai, Calo and Zatmar, in the division of Upper Hungary.
By vertue of this Grant, the Evangelicks that live in Maromaruss, Carpen, Tokai, and in any other abovemention'd Frontier Town, ought to enjoy the same free exer∣cise of Religion, and use the same Churches as they did in those Towns when the Ar∣ticle was made. IX. Furthermore, in all the free and Mountain Towns, as in Trenschinmodra, Cremnicz, Novizolium, and in all the Cities of Upper Hungary, places shall be assign'd likewise for Churches, Schools and Parishes. What more direct and clear can be con∣cluded from these words, but that in the free Cities, such as are Cassovia, Epperies, Leuschovia, Bartpha, Cibinium, Kesmurkim, Nagybania, Presburg, Tyrnaw, Zakoliza, Bazinium, Modra, St. George Kussegh, Rust, and in the Mountain Towns such as are Novizolium, Veterozolium, Carpen, Schemni∣nizium, Cremniczium, Libeten, Breznow, Baka, Bela, Vibania, &c. (for the modify∣ing of which, two of each sort, viz. of the free Cities, and of the Mountain Towns, are brought as instances with a certain di∣stinction, or specification used before) convenient places for Churches, Parishes and Schools, must be assigned not out of the Walls which were to restrain the Article, but in the very middle of the Cities and Towns, according to the genuine and literal meaning of the words of the aforesaid Article. X. Finally, the Churches which are actually possessed by those of the Hel∣vetian Confession, and of that of Ausburg shall be still for their use as before, toge∣ther with the Parishes and Schools and their Revenues, that they may live in peace and quiet; but the same free use of Bells and Burials is left to the Catholicks in those parts as to them. This confirms evidently the above writ∣ten seventh Point, and signifieth that the Churches which the Evangelicks were actu∣ally possessed of, should remain for their use, together with the Revenues, Parishes, and Schools; the Bells and Burials remain∣ing common for the use of both Par∣ties.
XI. Nevertheless the Catholicks shall not be obliged to pay any thing to the Mi∣nisters of the Evangelicks, nor the Evan∣gelicks to the Curates of the Catholicks, according to the meaning of the 11th Ar∣ticle Ann. 1647. This cannot be clearer, nor better Com∣mented upon than by the confirmed 11th Article which runs thus: The Evangelicks shall not be obliged to pay any thing to the Catholick Curates, nor the Catho∣licks to the Evangelick Ministers: And by the following 12th Article, yet more plainly in these words; But where the Evange∣licks have no Parishes, let them pay the Ministers that they employ, as the Ca∣tholicks are to pay their Catholick Cu∣rates; and where hitherto the Evangelicks did pay nothing to the Catholick Cu∣rates, they shall not be obliged hereafter to pay under any pretence whatsoever; Nor the Catholicks to the Evangelick Ministers. Add to this the words of the aforesaid 12th Article in the year 1647, con∣cerning the Revenues and Pensions of the Schools; But in any place whatsoever the Catholick Curates, and the Evangelick Ministers shall receive the Revenues of Schools, and Pensions from their respective followers; by which most evident constitution of the Articles, the Evangelicks are freed and discharged from paying any thing to the Catholick Curates; and to this positive Law we desire to adhere. XII. All the Peers and Noblemen that live in the Kingdom have Liberty to Build and Endow Oratories, and Chap∣pels according to their respective profession of Religion in their usual places of Resi∣dence. Hereupon we require, that Noblemen may have Oratories and Chappels accor∣ding to their respective professions of Re∣ligion in their usual dwelling places, as the same was practised in many Counties after the taking of our Churches. XIII. Hereafter no Churches, Schools and Parishes shall be seized, nor Exercise hinder'd on either side, under the pain ex∣pressed in the 8th Article of the 6th Decree of Uladislaus. Against the VI. No Convenient places for Churches, Parishes and Chappels have been assign'd in any free Royal Town of Upper Hungary, but here the Commissioners, there the Officials of the Chamber, and elsewhere private Persons, as in Cassovia and Epperies, have appointed places for Churches, Parishes and Schools, which are at a great distance in the Fields, out of Desert and Desolate, Suburbs; and which are for any Common use of the Three Nations, which rendreth them so inconvenient and nasty, that to dedicate Churches to the most Holy God in such places, were a most detestable Crime for any sort of Christians. Against the VII. In many Counties as also in that of Sachsag, (which is one of the afore∣nam'd) the Kings Commissioners have caused all the Churches to be taken from the Evan∣gelicks, and their Ministers to be turn'd out by the Vicount of that County; the Officials have done the like in the Counties of Abavi∣vivar, of Semlyn, of Ugoza, and in all the Towns of the Dominion of Tokai, as we have already mention'd; and some private Persons have presum'd to seize upon the Church belong∣ing to those of the Helvetian Confession, and of that of Ausbourg in the Town of Gyon∣gyos, (which Gyongyos maketh the most considerable part of the County of Hewecz) to put out their Ministers, and even forbid the Evangelicks to exercise any way their Religion in that place. The like has been done in the Town of Jaszbreny, and the Frontiers of Legrad, although the abovemen∣tion'd Counties be named in the Article, whereby the Evangelicks are left in the Pos∣session of all those Churches, which they had in the said Counties when the Article was made. Against the VIII. In the Town of Maro∣maruss, and in the places round about it, pri∣vate Men have forbidden the whole exercise of Religion, charging with Beat of Drums all the Evangelicks, to go and exercise their Religion out of that Frontier under pain of Imprisonment, and other severe Punishments. After the same manner the King's Commissioners in Carpen, and the Deputies in Tokai have
forbidden the exercise of Religion, and seiz'd upon the Churches, although both these places be particularly named in the Articles. Against the IX. The said Commissioners, or their Deputies have appointed places for Churches, Schools and Parishes out of Tren∣schin, Modra, Cremnicz and Novizolium, and none at all in the rest of the Towns of Lower Hungary; now why should the Case of some be worse than that of others? since all have the same Priviledge of Liberty in Upper Hungary. They have likewise appointed some places for Churches, Schools and Parishes not in, but out of the Cities, against the true meaning of the opposite part of the Article, which most evidently declareth, that those places must be appointed within and not with∣out the Walls of the Cities, or else they could not be such as are appointed Fig. 6. i. e. con∣venient and fit to be consecrated for the pub∣liek service of God. Against the X. In many Counties, and par∣ticularly in that of Sachsag, and the Town of Gyongyos, the King's Commissioners have taken such Churches together, with their Ap∣pendages as were possessed by the Evange∣licks, when the Article was made, which we have hinted in the foregoing fifth Grievance. Moreover in the aforesaid Town of Gyongyos, mny private Persons have taken all the Ec∣clesiastical Revenues, and Pious Legacies from the Evangelicks, forbidding them withal to Bury their Dead in the usual places, which has made many keep Corps in Cellars a long time, rather than Bury them in Carfax and Cross∣ways as they were appointed. The Commissi∣oners have also deprived the Evangelicks of the use of the Bells almost every where; the Officials have done the like in the County of Semlin, and particularly in these Towns of the aforesaid Dominion of Tokai, Thalia, Mod, Zantho, Kerethur, Tarezal Liszka, Benny, Tolezva, Patak, Veyelly, Borzi and Tokai seizing upon all the Churches, Schools and Parishes, (which at the time of and after the Treaty were possessed by the Evangelicks, and left to the same by the said Article) toge∣ther with the Revenues that have been given to them by the Evangelicks, forbidding with most severe threatnings the free exercise of our Religion even in private Houses, and hinder∣ing the Evangelicks from the common use of Burials and Bells, though made at their own care and charge. Likewise the Magistrates and Clergy Men of the Town of Cassovia and Epperies, have taken by force all the pious Legacies left to our Churches, and forbidden abso∣lutely the common use of Bells and Burials, Threatning with the most severe Punishments those that would make publick Burials within the Walls, with the usual Singing and decent Ceremonies.
Against the XI. Every where in the Coun∣ties, the Commissioners have adjudged all the Payments to the Catholick Curates, and Or∣dered in the Cities that they should be paid out of the common Purse, wherein the Cha∣tholicks could contribute but little, they being but few in number in comparison of the Evange∣licks; thus they have forced us maugre our selves, to be at extraordinary Charges out of our own States, for the maintaining of our Ministers and School-masters, not only against the right intention of the aforesaid Articles, but also against the plain Sense of the Holy Scripture, which allows a Salary for such as Labour, and even nothing to Eat for such as Labour not: After the like manner the Offi∣cial of the abovementioned Dominion of To∣kai in Upper Hungary, do all their endea∣vours to make both Noble and Ignoble Evan∣gelicks, pay without distinction the Chatholick Curates. Against the XII. In many Counties, viz. in that of Lypcz, of Turocz, of Zolnock, of Arva, &c. the said Commissioners have suppressed and forbidden, under pain of Military Execution the exercise of Religion, which is granted to Noblemen in their places of Residence, and which they had enjoy'd long since the Churches were seized accordingly in the County of Lypcze, the Clergy Men have caused some such Noblemen's Houses to be assaulted, and plunder'd by the Garrison of Likavia, and in the County of Trenschin, the Noble Family of Nosdrovisky which did keep a Minister, for the Exercise of Religion in its place of Residence, has been much damnified also by the Soldiers of Mersia's Regiment, and the Ministers put into the Prison of the Fort of Ledniche, where he is kept to this day; likewise the Noblemen of Hodossia, of the places round about in the Isle of Shut, have been deprived of the free exercise of Religion in their places of Residence, and the Ministers that lived there then, have been Plunder'd of all their Goods, which Injustice the Evangelick Noblemen of Lower Hungary do also complain of. Would to God that this Conclusion were ob∣served, and the Punishment hinted in the Article inflicted upon the Opposers thereof; then we might promise our selves to enjoy quietly, and undisturbedly the free exercise of our Religion, and then the fewel of Divi∣sions would be extinguished, and taken away for fear of being Punish'd, which, that it may be done is our Hearty Prayer and Desire. Now having lay'd before Your Sacred Majesty the Articles of Sopron, and the Abuses committed in the executing of them, it is as clear as the Sun, that we require nothing but what is granted in them; We humbly beseech Your most Sacr'd Majesty, through Christ's Precious Death and Glorious Resurrection, that having known and laid up in Your Royal Heart our lawful Requests, Your Sacred Majesty suffer no longer the same
to be hinder'd by any Person whatsoever, but rather (since after so long time they have been Reported before Your most Sacred Majesty, and before Your Privy Council, toge∣ther with some Treatises of the appointed Commission; Nay, being inform'd that a cer∣tain Point of the said Treatises (that doth not concern us) has been examin'd by the Lords of the Privy Council; it makes us fear, lest something else be taken into consi∣deration, whereby an Answer to our Requests may be occasion'd, and we yet longer de∣tain'd here under the inconveniency of Doubt, of Delay, and of continuance of the vast Charges we have already been at) according to Your most Sacred Majesty's Gracious Consent (given to the most High Prince President of the Court, and intimated to us by his Highness) to dispatch first the Business of Religion, that Your Sacred Majesty be graciously pleased to appoint and commit our Requests, which so narrowly concern the Salvation of our Souls, to be consider'd again, and determin'd by the Lords of the Privy Council, so to Establish us in the Liberty of Religion, to the Immortal Fame of Your Royal Government, after the Example of Your Glorious Predecessors; that being reliev'd We may speedily Return to our Principals, and God will recompence this Im∣perial, Royal Favour with all sort of Happines from above. Deliver'd to His Sacred Majesty at Aix la Chapelle, upon his going to Vienna, the 24th day of April, in the year 1689. Your most Sacred Majesty's most Humble and Faithful Subjects, the Deputies of the Evangelicks in the Counties, Cities, Towns and Frontiers of Upper and Lower Hungary, about the Business of their distressed Religion. The First Article of the Peace of Vienna in the Year 1606. AS to the Business of Religion, notwithstanding the former publick Constitutions, and the last Article of the Year 1604, (which was made without the Diet, and the consent of the Subjects, and therefore is annulled,) it is granted, That (according to his Imperial Majesty's former Resolution, to which the Subjects refer themselves in their replying) all and each State of the Kingdom of Hungary, as well the Peers and Noblemen, as the free Cities, and the Privileged Towns belonging immediately to the Crown, and all the Hungarian Soldiers in the Frontiers, shall any where, and at any time profess and exercise their Religion without any Disturbance, either from His most Sacr'd Majesty, or from any Person whatsoever; a free exercise of Religion being here∣by granted to all the said States of the Kingdom. Provided always, That the Roman Catholick Religion be not thereby prejudiced, That the Roman Catholick Clergy, Churches and Chappels remain free and unmolested, and that what has been taken from them in these Troubles be restor'd. The First Article made before the Coronation in the Year 1608. concerning Religion. COncerning the first Article of the Treaty of Vienna, it is resolv'd by the States and Orders of Hungary, that the Exercises of Religion shall be left free, not only to the Noblemen, and to the Inhabitants of the free Cities, but also to the Hungarian Soldi∣ers in the Frontiers of the Kingdom of Hungary, and to all the Farmers and Peasant that will freely accept the same; nor shall any of 'em be disturbed in the free Exercise of Religion, but to prevent any effect of hatr'd and dissension between Roman Catholicks and Protestants, It is Order'd, That each Party shall have a Superior, or Surperinten∣dant of his own Profession. Although this last first Article of the Year 1608, was renew'd in 77th Article of the Year 1618, inserted in the General Constitutions of the Kingdom by Order of the Em∣peror Ferdinand the Second, in the Year 1622, restor'd to his Force by the 22d Article of the Year 1625, by the 33d Article of the Year 1630, and by the 29th Article of the Year 1635, confirm'd in the 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14th Articles of the new Treaty of Peace made with George Ragoczy, Prince of Transilvania in the Year 1648; Ratifyed both in the aforenamed Articles of 1649, and in the 10th Article of the Year 1649, and in the 18th Article of the Year 1655 made at Rakoczia; and lastly, confirm'd again and inserted in the Constitutions of the Kingdom, by Order of Leopold the present Emperor, in the Year 1659; yet notwithstanding all these, the said Article remains without Force, and the Exercise of the Protestant Religion is wholly exterminated against the Articles, and the publick Constitutions of the King¦dom, as well as against the Sacred Imperial Letters Patent.
And yet all this contributed little to∣wards a Peace, for the Results of this Diet concerned none but the good and quiet Men, and such as were zealous for the Settlement and Peace of their Country: Whilest Tekeli and others of that Spirit, whose Minds were possess'd with virulent Malice and Ambition, were plotting and contriving the means to set up their own Authority, and give themselves into the Hands of the Turks, rather than to the Power of their Sovereign Prince, of whose natural Clemency thô they were well as∣sur'd; yet they suspected and fear'd his Councils, which being chiefly influenced and directed by Jesuits, and the Spirit of the Clergy could never be reconciled in any tollerable manner to the Protestant pro∣fession.Tekeli be∣sieges Kalo. Thus whilest things were Nego∣tiating in the Diet Tekeli besieg'd Kalo, which surrendr'd at discretion with little or no resistance; and Prince Apafi joyning with some Parties of the Malecontents laid Seige to Zatmar, with an Army composed of Transilvanians, Moldavians, Turks and Malecontents of Hungary, all which acted in four separate Bodies, being well provided with Cannon, and all sorts of Ammunition and Provisions; so soon as Apafi had form'd his Siege, he put forth a Manifest or De∣claration, which he caused to be privately stolen into the Town, and there dispers'd, signifying, that out of Christian piety, and compassion to the miserable state of that Kingdom,Apafi's De∣claration. he had left his Country and Dwelling with no other intent, than only to cause their Churches to be restor'd to them, with a free Liberty of Conscience and Exercise of Religion; and that their Estates which had been confiscated for the sake of their Religion, and defence of their Rights, and Privileges might be again re∣stor'd to them: To which he added many Solemn Protestations, that he had no other end, nor intention than the welfare and happiness of the Kingdom. Farther also he said, that he had a power sufficient for this Enterprise, being well seconded by the Grand Seignior, and acted by his Commission, and that the Succession to the Principality was promised unto his Son; to whom, be∣sides the Forces with him, he had left a Guard of 20.000 Men. Having made thus much known to the Inhabitants of Zatmar, he vigorously proceeded in the Siege,Apafi in∣vests Zat∣mar. having received a Recruit of 8000 Men from the Pasha of Buda, being a Detachment from 40.000, which were Encamp'd before the place whereof he was Governour: And thô with these Forces the Town of Zatmar was taken; yet Serini who Commanded the place retiring into the Castle or Cita∣del, he so well defended the same, that Apafi was forc'd to raise the Siege and march away; burning several Towns,  The Siege raised. and taking a Thousand Prisoners in his Retreat. The raising of this Siege was variously in∣terpreted, and so ill taken by the Turks, that Complaints were made thereof against Apafi at the Port. But it was no time now to make alterations, or disturbances in Transilvania. Towards the end of this year, the Em∣peror being desirous to Crown the Empress at Oedembourg, sent a Convoy of 500 Hus∣sars, 100 Heyduks,The Em∣press Crowned Queen of Hungary. and 500 Cuirassiers to fetch the Crown of St. Stephen from the Castle of Presburg, where it is always lodg'd, which being brought thither the Empress was Crown'd Queen of Hungary with great Solemnity: And that this Ceremony might be performed with the more order and se∣curity, a Cessation of Arms was agreed with Tekeli for six Moths. And to make appear, how propitious this day of Coro∣nation was like to be, Count Caprara fell on the Rear of Apafi's Forces, as they were retiring into their own Country, took all their Baggage, and entring into Transil∣vania burn'd five Castles and divers Villa∣ges; and thus ended the Campagne of this year. ANNO, 1682. WIth this year the Scene of War be∣gan to open,  and the Turks to declare their Resolutions bent all their Forces against Hungary. Nor would the Malecontents maintain the Truce made by Tekeli, or be restrain'd from committing many Acts of Hostility. For thô the Ces∣sation of Arms was again confirm'd and re∣newed, yet in despight of this Treaty, and contrary to the Faith given,The Male∣contents and Turks intercept the Corn and Sol∣diers Cloths belonging to the Em∣peror's Army. the Malecon∣tents seiz'd on all the Grane, which the Emperor had bought on the Frontiers of Poland, as it was carrying to the several Stores and Granaries, where it was to be lodged: And about the same time the Turks took many Carts laden with Soldiers Coats, as they were carrying to the Im∣perial Army. Howsoever, Tekeli pretended to keep and conserve the Faith and Pro∣mises which he had given; and during that Vacation made a Journey to Buda with a Guard of 3000 Men, where he was recei∣ved by the Pasha of that Place,Tekeli re∣ceived at Buda. at the Head of his Janisaries, and conducted with great Magnificence and State to the Palace; where the Pasha took off Tekeli's Cap, and placed on his Head another after the Tur∣kish fashion richly Embroider'd, and beset with Precious Stones and Herons Feathers, which some call a Diadem; and say, that with that Ceremony he was by the Turks
created King of Hungary. Howsoever it was so carried, that the Emperor under∣stood it not in that manner, or at least would not so interpret it; for at the same time he received a Messenger from Tekeli, who came to desire his Majesty's consent, that he might take the Widow of Prince Ragotski to Wife;The Em∣peror as∣sents to the Marriage of Tekeli with the Princess Ragotski. to which the Emperor readily assented, knowing that the Marri∣age would succeed in case he refused, and so making a Virtue of necessity, he hoped by such a Gracious condescention, to re∣gain the Heart of Tekeli, unless it were become obdurate beyond all possibility of being won, either by Generosity or Com∣pulsion. Having thus gain'd the Emperor's Assent, he speedily made a Journey to Mongatz, where he consummated the Mar∣riage with the Princess with great Joy and Solemnity, and took Possession of all the Towns, and Castles belonging to that Lady. Their Mar∣riage.She was bred up by her Mother in the Roman Catholick Religion, but her Hus∣band converted her, and made her a Pro∣testant. During the Life of her Mother she was restrain'd from this Marriage, but after her Death, she became an admirer of Tekeli's Bravery,  and yielded to the Ambition and Flatteries of being a Queen, which was whisper'd to her by her Hus∣band; who told her, that the Cap which the Pasha of Buda had put upon his Head, was no other than a Diadem after the Cu∣stom and Fashion of the Turks. The Em∣peror, who was a Stranger to these Mat∣ters, believing that some use might be made of this Alliance, whereby to gain the Mind of Tekeli, employ'd Count Serini to his Sister the Princess, to compass this Design; but so far was Serini from an∣swering the expectations of his Imperial Majesty, that he enter'd into the Combi∣nation and Conspiracy with Tekeli him∣self. About the beginning of the Month of July, Count Albert Caprara, Brother of General Caprara, who resided for the Empe∣ror at Constantinople,The Turks offer Con∣ditions shameful for the Emperor. advised, That at length he had been admitted unto Audience with the Grand Vizier, who declar'd, That he would neither continue the Truce longer, nor yet renew it, but on these following Conditions. That Hungary should be restor'd unto the Condition, in which it was in the year 1655. That the Kingdom should pay the An∣nual Tribute of Fifty thousand Florins every Year unto the Grand Seignior. That the Fortifications of Leopolstadt, and Gratz should be demolished. That Neutra, Schultz and Eckof, with the Island of Schultz neer Presburg, and the Fortress of Muran be deliver'd, and sur∣rendred up into the Hands of Count Tekeli. That a General Pardon be given to the Malecontents, and that they be restor'd to their Goods and Estates, and to all their Privileges and Immunities, in such manner as if none of these Wars or Disturbances had happen'd. But these Conditions were so hard, and shameful to be imposed on any but a conquer'd People, that it was adjudg∣ed by the Emperor's Council, that an ho∣nourable War, was much rather to be pre∣ferr'd, before such an Ignominious and Scandalous Peace. The time for the Cessation of Arms be∣ing expir'd, to which the Malecontents had yielded only to gain time, whilest the Turks were preparing their formidable Army,Successes of Tekeli at Zatmar. Tekeli surpriz'd the Castle of Zat∣mar, and put all the Garrison consisting of Eighty Men, to the Sword; and turning afterwards his Cannon on the City, it was Surrender'd to him at Discretion. Thence he Marched to Cassovia, and laid Siege to it,Cassovia and Filek besieged and taken and at the same time the Transilvanians and Moldavians joyning with the Pasha of Buda, laid Siege to Filek. Whilest Tekeli lay before Cassovia, he received a Recruit of Fourteen thousand Men, which were supply'd to him by his Wife the Princess, out of those Troops which were levied in her own Country; and the Pasha of Agria came with Four thousand Horse more to his assistance. The Town was notwith∣standing bravely defended for several days by Lieutenant Colonel Lamb; but being out of hopes of all Succours it Surrender'd at Discretion: Many of the Garrison revol∣ted to the Malecontents; but Four hundred of them endeavouring to Retire, and ha∣ving given no intimation of a Mine, which afterwards was Sprang with great loss and hurt of the Besiegers, they were all put to the Sword: The Governour was made a Prisoner of War, and the Inhabitants to save themselves from Pillage and Plunder, paid the Sum of 50.000 Crowns. The Inhabitants of Esperies being affrighted at the misfortune of Cassovia,Esperies yields. Surrender'd it self on Conditions without striking one Stroak; the German Garrison being Two hundred in all, were permitted to March out with their Baggage, and had a safe Conduct as far, as to the Frontiers of Poland, and from thence License to March into Silesia, nor were the Priests and Ro∣man Catholicks permitted to remain in the City. After which, Tekeli by advice of the Pasha of Buda demolished the whole Town,And is de∣molished. not being obliged to maintain a Garrison for it's defence. In the mean time the Pasha of Waradin laid Siege to Filek, and took it in
despight of Strazoldo, who left the Villa∣ges of the Mountains, and marched with Three thousand Horse and Four thousand Foot for its Relief; as also to the same end, Count Caprara passed the River Waagh with Six thousand Men, whilest Count Staremberg defended the Passage with Four or Five thousand Men, and the Pala∣tine Esterhasi was coming on the other side with Six thousand Men more; yet notwithstanding the Art and Bravery of so many Generals, the Town was taken in their own Sight, as if they had only come with design to be Spectators of the Suc∣cess, and Victory of their Enemies. The Hungarian Souldiers, who were in the Gar∣rison took part with the Turks; but the Ger∣mans were made Prisoners of War, and all the Women and Children were carried away Captives, and the place it self was razed and demolished. Leventz and Neutra fol∣lowed the like Example, and Surrender'd to the Turks; of all which Acts of Hostility, when Complaints were made by the Em∣peror to the Pasha of Buda, no other Answer was return'd, Than that those Acti∣ons were not to be esteemed as Breaches of the Truce, in regard they were only made in pursuit of Thieves and Robbers who had Infested the Countries, and took Refuge and Sanctuary in those Cities. After these Successes, Tekeli made In∣cursions into the County of Seposo, where he Plunder'd and Burnt Sobora and Saftzin, Towns belonging to Prince Lubomiski Great Marshal of Poland; which was the Cause (as we shall afterwards understand) why Six thousand Polish Horse joyn'd them∣selves to General Schultz, under the Com∣mand and Conduct of that Prince ANNO 1683. ALL hopes and expectations of Peace being now laid aside, the Vizier be∣ing advanced with his Troops as far as Belgrade, the Emperor notwithstanding to leave nothing undone which might tend to a Peace,Saponara sent to Bel∣grade. dispatched Saponara to Belgrade, to Sollicite once more for more easy Con∣ditions than what had been offer'd to Count Albert Caprara at Constantinople:  But be∣cause Matters were gone too far, to expect any fruit, or benefit from such Negotiati∣ons; and because it was not probable, but rather impossible that the Vizier, who would not accept of the Conditions offer'd him by the Emperor, before he removed from the Port, would now after a long March to Belgrade, and after he had raised all the Militia and Power of Asia, and been at a vast expence in the Preparations of War; should now condescend, or remit these Demands which had formerly been requir'd: Wherefore as I say, The Empe∣ror expecting no farther benefit from a Treaty, than only to satisfy himself and the World, that he had done every thing in his Power, which might produce a Peace; he provided for War, and in the first place employ'd Count Martinitzion on an Embassie to the Pope, and other Princes of Italy to obtain from them Aid, and Suc∣cours both of Men and Money. The Emperor's Forces towards the end of the last year,Forces raised. and at the beginning of this, consisted of 20.000 Men; to increase which, Orders were given to all Colonels, and Officers fully to Compleat their Regi∣ments, and Troops against the end of May. Commissions were also given out to raise Six Regiments of Horse, and one of Foot, besides Four Regiments of Croats: And the Regiment of Prince Charles of Loraine,  being fully recruited was divided into two Bodies:Money raised. And to raise Money for maintenance of these new Levies, and for the War, the Hundreth Peny was laid on all Rents of Lands, and Revenue or Income from Offices, by which it was supposed, that a vast Sum might be raised: And moreover Four Millions were borrowed; for security of which a Mortgage was given to Count Swartzemberg, and other Ministers upon the Demesnes of the Dutchy of Trinchin and Silesia. The Fortifications of Vienna were continued with greater di∣ligence,Vienna fortified. and numbers of Men than former∣ly; and the Suburbs were order'd to be demolished, and the Cellars to be filled up with Earth; thô the Inhabitants being desirous to continue in their Dwellings, so long as was possible, deferr'd to abandon their Houses, until such time as they were assur'd of the certainty of a Siege in∣tended. The Emperor being by this time farther assur'd, that the Turks design'd nothing less than a Peace, having made all the Steps and Preparations necessary towards a War, dispatched his Orders to Count Albert Caprara, to take his last Audience of leave,Count Al∣bet Ca∣prara re∣called. and so depart from the Ottoman Court: But that License would not be granted to him; it being the Custom of the Turks in all their Wars, to carry the Person of the Ambassador of that Prince with them in their Camp, against whom they wage War, with intention to make use of his Service, in case the Success of Affairs should at any time incline them to a Treaty. The Baron of Kaunitz was sent to the Elector of Bavaria, and Count Windisgratz to the Princes of the Circles of Lower Saxony and Westphalia, moving them to enter into such Measures and Coun∣cils
with the Emperor, as might tend to the Conservation of Hungary, Germany allam'd by the Turks.All Christendom now Allarum'd by the vast preparations of the Turks, whose Force appear'd sufficient, not only to over∣spread Hungary, but to over-run all Ger∣many in one Summer; so that the Com∣mon safety seem'd now to be in danger: The Diet at Ratisbon was then Sitting, and Consulting for the Common Welfare and Security, for which the Emperor was so much concern'd, that he resolved once to have been present there in Person; but that his Deputies who resided for him, gave his Imperial Majesty such assurances of the zeal, and care the Diet had for conservation of the Empire; that were his Majesty there in Person, nothing could be more done than what was resolved, and then acting by that Diet. Saponara privately Treats with Te∣keli.Saponara not being able to Prevail any thing upon the Vizier at Belgrade, was Order'd to try what he could work upon Tekeli, to draw him off from the Turks. In pursuance of which he went to Mongatz, where Tekeli lay Sick of a Fever, and being his antient Friend and Acquain∣tance, was some time during the inter∣mission of his Fits admitted into his Cham∣ber, where in the Emperor's Name, he of∣fer'd to him a Sovereignity over all those Places of which he was Master in the Upper Hungary, with several other Demesnes ap∣pertaining thereunto, and to hold the same on the very Conditions which were given to Boscai, who raised Arms against the Emperor in the year 1605. Besides which, such Conferences passed, as are usual with Sick Men, who are commonly relenting, and desirous of Gods Glory and the pub∣lick Peace: But when Tekeli grew better, and return'd to his perfect state of Health, he then confessed plainly, that his Circum∣stances were such, and his Union with the Turks so Knit and Engaged, that it was im∣possible for him to separate, or destricate himself from their Interest and Party. With which Answer Saponara being con∣vinced, that nothing was to be done on this side, return'd to Vienna to give his Majesty new assurances thereof. Wherefore now to proceed in the provisions for a War, Alliances were to be cultivated; and in the first place, the Treaty with Poland was rather to be renewes than begun, for (as we have before mention'd) the Poles had pressed the Ratification thereof with much earnestness; but in regard the Em∣peror was entertain'd constantly with hopes and a prospect of Peace, he deferr'd the Conclusion thereof for the last Reserve, to help and conserve him, after all other Negoti∣ations proved vain and fruitless. Count Wal∣lestain was the Person appointed to per∣form, and compleat this great Work; and accordingly having received a Commission, and Instructions for so great a Management, he made a Journey to Warsaw in Poland,Count Wal∣lestain sent into Po∣land. where he found the Diet then Sitting, but embroil'd in a thousand difficulties, and dif∣ferences amongst themselves, (as is usual in all such great Councils and Assemblies,) representing Aggrievances, and accusing great Men. The business of the high Trea∣surer of that Kingdom was then in Agita∣tion, and his Accounts and Administration of that Office were under Examination; upon which many of the Nobility were so intent, that when Count Wallestain arrived with Instructions, and Plenary Power from the Emperor, to conclude a League offen∣sive and defensive with Poland; they op∣posed his admission to Audience, until such time as they had composed their own in∣testine Differences, and provided in the first place, for the safety of their own King∣dom: And so far had some angry and tur∣bulent Spirits pressed this Matter, that the Diet was in danger of being Dissolved without any Conclusion, either in reference to their own Affairs, or League with the Empire. But the King, and principal Nobility joyning their endeavours with those of Cardinal Pio, Nuntio of Pope Innocent the 11th,His Nego∣tiations there. and of the Emperor's Ambassador, represented unto the Diet in General, the necessity of a speedy Union against the Common Enemies; declaring the Turks and Tartars, were ready on the very Confines to over-run all Poland, Hun∣gary and Germany: And because, that not∣withstanding all that could be said, there were still certain Spirits unsatisfied; it was the care of the King, and of the o∣thers to deal with them in private, and conjure them to give no stop, but to con∣cur with them in this important Negotiati∣on: Thus whole Nights were spent in paci∣fying the Spirits of the Polish Nobility, who love to exert their Authority, and to have Applications and Addresses made to them; and at length they were so prevailed upon, that remitting the Affairs of the Grand Treasurer, and of other Ag∣grievances to the consideration of the next Diet; they resolved to Treat on no other for the present, than what related to the making such Confederacies, as tended to the security and safety of the Kingdom. And in regard the several Points, and Articles with Moscovy were intricate, and requir'd time to debate; it was agreed, without descending to other particulars in that Treaty, to renew the Truce for three years longer, and during that time to en∣ter into a League Offensive and Defensive
with the Emperor and King of Poland, a∣gainst the Common Enemy of Christendom. Thus with much Labour and Assiduity,The League concluded between the Empe∣ror and King of Poland. the Providence of God assisting the Christian Councils, as he did afterwards their Arms; the League was concluded and sign'd on the 18th of April, being the Day of the Festi∣val of Christ's Resurrection;  with which the Diet was Dissolved to the General satis∣faction of that whole Assembly: The News hereof which filled all Christendom with an Universal Joy, was immediately dispatched to Vienna by an Express, who moving with the Wings of Messengers, who carry such pleasing Tydings, arrived in a very short time at the Emperor's Court, to the unexpressible Joy of the whole Em∣pire. The Chief Heads of the Treaty were these. First, That the League Offensive shall con∣tinue until such time, as that the Emperor, and King of Poland shall make Peace with the Common Enemy, but that the Defensive shall continue for ever. Secondly, That this Alliance shall be sworn unto by Cardinal Pio in behalf of the Em∣peror, and by Cardinal Charles Barberini at Rome, in the name and behalf of the King of Poland. Thirdly, That the Emperor shall Renounce, and quit claim to all Debts and Sums of Money which were due to him from Poland, on occasion of the Succours, and Assistances he gave unto that Kingdom, when it was Invad∣ed by the Swedes: And that the great Seal whereby the Emperor is impowred to nomi∣nate, and make choise of a new King be Can∣celled and Surrendred. Fourthly, That no Peace be made with the Turks without the privity, consent, and concurrence of both Parties; and that the Heirs and Successours of them be equally obliged to maintain, and confirm the present League. Fifthly, That this League be limited, and understood of a War against the Turk only, and not against any other Prince or Potentate whatsoever. Sixthly, That during this War, the Emperor be obliged to maintain 70.000 Men in the Field; besides 20.000 in Garrison: And that the King of Poland shall conduct an Army of 40.000 Men, and March at the Head of them in Person. Seventhly, That the Emperor shall act with the gross of his Army in the Lower Hungary against the Turk; and with another Army in the Upper Hungary, consisting of Six thousand Germans, and as many Auxiliaries, whose business shall chiefly be to subdue the Rebels, and recover the places which they have taken: And that the King of Poland shall endea∣vour to recover Caminiec, and other places unjustly usurped by the Turk in Podolia, Ucrania and Volhinia. Eighthly, That the Emperor shall lend unto the King of Poland 300.000 Dollars, and the payment thereof to be secur'd on the Tythes of that Kingdom, which the Pope hath lately granted to the King for carrying on this present War. Ninethly, That in case other Christian Kings, or Princes shall desire to enter into this Alliance, their admission thereinto shall be with the knowledge and approbation of both Crowns; and that the Czars of Muscovy be particularly induced to joyn in this Alliance. On these Terms was this League con∣cluded, so much the more to the comfort and satisfaction of all Christendom, by how much it had been uncertain and doubt∣ful before; in regard the Divisions in the Diet it self were grown so high, that it was believed no place could be allowed for the Debates of Foreign Matter, which did not immediately concern their own dif∣ferences; and that the resentment which the King of Poland conceived against the Emperor, for not closing with the Al∣liance formerly offer'd, and importunately urged, would have been invincible obsta∣cles against this Union, of which all the World despair'd: But God who directs all things to that end which he designs, had so temper'd and qualified the Animositis of the Poles one against the other, that to the Joy of all Christendom, that necessary and happy Alliance was concluded. The Grand Vizier (as we have said)  be∣ing arrived at Belgrade, where he attended the Asiatick Troops, and with him Count Albert Caprara the Emperor's Resident, (whom he reserved according to antient Custom in the Camp,Count Ca∣para licen∣sed to re∣turn to Vienna.) for an instrument to move and forward Treaties, in case any sinister success should befal the Ottoman Forces: But this Vizier fearing nothing less than ill fortune, and reposing a confidence in his Arm of Flesh, which he thought im∣possible to be subdued, did easily and with some scorn comply with the instance which Count Albert Caprara made to him for Licence to return to his Master at Vienna: And in order thereunto he was committed to the care, and conduct of the Bei of Alba Regalis, who was then Marching with his Men towards those parts. Howsoever, a stop was put to his departure for some few days, to the end, that he might be Spectator of the magnificent reception of Count Tekeli by the Vizier, which when he understood, he pressed his departure with more earnestness, that his Eyes might not be offended with the scandalous sight of a
Rebel promoted to Honour and Grandure, for Treason and Perfidiousness to his Sove∣reign.He refuses to behold the Rece∣ption of Te∣keli, and others. And when he heard that he came accompanied with many of the Hungarian Nobility, who were Roman Catholicks, and particularly with the Count of Homo∣nai, to the great scandal of the Gospel, and the Christian Profession, he was so transport∣ed with Disdain and Indignation, that he openly declared, in case the Vizier delayed to grant him License to depart, only because he would give him the Mortification to be∣hold an Object so ungrateful to his Eyes, that he would close them rather, or shut himself up in some Retirement, where he might neither see or hear any of these Mat∣ters: Of which the Vizier having notice he gave him free liberty to depart, and ac∣cordingly he set forward on his Journey on the 12/2 of June, in company with the Bei of Alba Regalis, who having attended Ca∣prara as far at Moatz, he was thence recal∣led by the Vizier; and the Bei of Albania appointed in his place, with a Guard of a∣bout a Hundred Men, who continuing their Journeys from day to day, happily arrived at Buda on the 20th. of June, not without great danger of falling into the hands of Tartars, who not considering the Persons, or Offices of Ambassadours, nor yet the Subjects of the Grand Seignior, whether Christians or Turks, put all to Fire and Sword, which they could not carry with them, not regarding either Age or Sex, but miserably destroyed all, wheresoever they could become Masters. Tho' C. Albert Caprara was well treated at Buda, as to his own Person, yet he was uneasie and impatient of his stay in that City, fearing lest the Barbarity of the Turks, upon any ill Success, should vent their Rage and Revenge upon him and his Attendants; but more sensibly was he affected with the daily sight of poor Christians enslaved, and led before him in Chains; and with the news of the Surrender of diverse Cities and Towns by Tekeli into the Possession of the Turks, according to the Articles made between him and the Grand Seignior; and which were so to remain, until a total Conquest was made of all Hungary, and were afterwards to be re∣stored again to Tekeli with the absolute So∣vereignty and Dominion of that Kingdom. But how uneasie soever C. Caprara was in his aboad at Buda,  he was constrained to continue there in regard to his own Safety, all the Ways and Passages being obstructed by Tartars and Free-booters, who had no respect to any thing but themselves and their own Prey and Benefit; so he remain'd there until the coming of the Vizier, and with him followed the Camp to the Siege of Vienna, from whence he was permitted to depart, and attend his Imperial Majesty then at Lintz, as we shall declare hereaf∣ter. But before we proceed farther, let us look back to the Preparations, and Fore-runners made in the Winter to the bloudy War, which was shortly to ensue.Preparati∣ons for War. The Turks in the Month of February, entred into the Isle of Serino in Croatia, and committed great Disorders; in Buda vast stores were making of all sorts of Ammunition and Provisions for War, with such Timber and Materials as were fit and proper for making Bridges: And in the mean time, Tekeli's Forces be∣sieged or blocked up all the Emperor's Towns in the Upper Hungary: And yet for all this, Tekeli sent to acquaint the Deputies of those Counties, which remained firm and loyal to the Emperor, with the earnest Passion he conceived to conserve the Peace of his Country, which he should certainly have done,Tekeli's Protestati∣ons. had his Imperial Majesty grant∣ed him any tollerable Conditions, and should have given undoubted Testimonies to the World of his Loyalty and Obedience to his Sovereign, against whom he took not up Arms out of any Animosity, but only to free his Country from Tyranny and Op∣pression; and in this good Humour he gave liberty unto 200 German Prisoners, and to Count Herberstein upon his Parole, and protested unto the Emperor, that he had dispatched two of his principal Ministers, namely Fagon and Sirmai, unto the Grand Seignior, to continue and prolong the Truce, and gave the same Assurances to the Diet, which he had convened at Cossovia. In the mean time, the Imperial Troops being ill paid, daily deserted the Service, and revol∣ted to the Malecontents, with whom they hoped to improve and better their Condition. Toward the end of this Month, the Turks, by a Detachment out of the Garrison of Newhausel, made an attempt to pass over the Ice to the Isle of Schults, under com∣mand of an Hungarian Renegade; but the Ice breaking, many of them were drown∣ed. In the Month of March the Turks placed a Guard of 15000 Men to defend the Bridge of Esseck,The Empe∣ror's Camp. from being burnt by the Christians: And the Emperor on his side caused his Troops, which were quartered near the Rhine, to march towards Hungary, as also the Regiment of Count Taaf then in Bohemia; and all the other Troops were ordered to draw towards Presburg; and were near thereunto encamped in the Plain of Kitzee by Count Rabata, that the Em∣peror might there make a Review of all his Forces, designed that Year against the Turk.
On the 7th. of May, the Emperor enter∣ed into the Field, attended on the Right-hand by the Duke of Bavaria,He takes a review of all his Ar∣my. and on the Left by P. Charles of Loraine, and follow∣ed by a numerous train of Nobles and prin∣cipal Ministers: The Army was all ran∣ged in Batalia, at the front of which, was Count Staremberg, General of the Artillery, with 72 great Pieces of Canon, and 15 Mortar pieces for throwing Bombs, all guarded by the Gunners, and Attendants on the Train of Artillery. The main Body of the Army was composed of 14 Regiments; namely, Staremberg, Mansfelt, Diepenthal, Baden, Grana, Strasoldo, Souches, Heisser, Bech, Wallis, Schaffemberg, Newberg, Thime, and Wirtemberg: The which Body was flanked on each side with a Regiment of Cuirassiers, and 12 Regiments of Horse; namely, Rabata, Gondola, Halleweil, Palsi, Dunevalt, Caprara, Montecuculi, Saxolunem∣burg, Taaff, Goz, Dupigny, and Mercy, with 3 of Dragoons, Stirum, Castelli, and Her∣beville, and 4 Companies of Croats com∣manded by Riccardi; all of them well arm∣ed, and mounted, and most of them select and veterane Soldiers: To these were ad∣joined a Body of Hungarians and Hussars, being Horse and Foot, under the Command of Count Hesterhasi, Palatine of that King∣dom,The number of the For∣ces. to the number of about eight Thou∣sand with 14 Pieces of Cannon; about a Thousand whereof were armed with long Lances, the number of all which, as some Authors report, amounted unto 70.740; thô as yet the Forces of Alsatia, with those of the Circles of the Rhine, were not come up; but others perhaps with more reason make this whole Force to consist of no more than forty three Thousand Men in all, be∣sides six Thousand Polish Horse, which the Emperor had hired with his own Mony, under the Command of Prince Lubomiski, to which were adjoyned great numbers of Gentlemen, and younger Brothers, who came to adventure and make their Fortunes in this War. After the Emperor had heard Mass, which was celebrated by the Arch-bishop of Stri∣gonium, and sang with Musick, the Arch-bishop read with a loud Voice the Bull of In∣dulgence, which the Pope had given unto all those who should fight the Christian Battles against Turks and Infidels; after which, he gave his Benediction to the Emperor, and the Nobility, and to all the Army, who re∣ceived it with much Humility, and Devoti∣on on their Knees; which Ceremony being ended, the Emperor took a View of the whole Army, greatly to his satisfaction: After which he was conducted to a mag∣nificent Tent,Duke of Loraine feasts the Court. raised on the Banks of the Danube, where he was splendidly treated by the Duke of Loraine, together with the Empress, the Arch-duchess, the Elector of Bavaria, the Prince of Newbourg, (Coad∣jutor of the Grand Master of the Tutonick Order) the Prince Lewis of Baden, and the Duke of Saxelawemburg. After which mag∣nificent Entertainment, the Emperor and the Court returned that Night unto Presburg. Such being the force of the Emperor's Army; let us also take a View of the formidable numbers of the Turks, which were suffici∣ent, like Locusts, to over-spread the face of all Hungary. But first we shall observe the Motions of the Emperor's Army, which being now in it's Vigour and Strength, and encouraged with fifty Thousand Florins, which his Imperial Majesty was pleased as a Donative to distribute amongst the Soldi∣ers; it was agreed by the Generals of the Army, for the Reputation of their Forces, that some Enterprise should be undertaken, before the Grand Vizier, with the gross of his Army, was advanced farther, which ac∣cording to their Conjectures, was believed could not be in less than in the time of two Months. The Places nominated for to be attack'd, were Gran and Newhausel; the first seemed the most easie in respect to the weakness of the Fortifications; but Advices being come that the Turks were forming a Camp of 40.000 Men near Buda, whereby the Imperialists might be cut off from all Communication with Comorra; it was re∣solved to change the Design, and to march towards Newhausel.  Accordingly the Troops were commanded to march, and on the se∣cond of June, some Battalions of the first Brigade posted themselves near the Neker, about Cannon-shot distant from the Town; in two or three days afterwards the whole Army being come up, they too possessed themselves of the Suburbs, and of a Palanca, which covered the Gate towards Buda side, and lodged within a Hundred Paces of the Ditch; and on the 6th. and 7th. of this Month the whole Town was surrounded,Newhausel besieged. and the Platforms raised to receive the Can∣non for Batteries, and all things put into a condition of a formal Siege. But whilst Matters were carrying on in this posture, the Duke of Loraine received Orders from the Court at Vienna to desist from that En∣terprise, for that the Turks were far advan∣ced into Stiria, and the Grand Vizier, with a vast Power of the Ottoman Force, as far as Esseck: Hereupon a Council of War being cal∣led, and the Orders communicated to them, the Siege which was laid the 3d. of June, was raised on the 10th, and the Army marched towards Raab and Comorra, to rein∣force those Garrisons, and from thence to observe the Motions of the Enemy. Many were the Reflections on the Enterprise of
Newhausel; it seeming strange, that so wise a Captain as the Duke of Loraine, should commence so difficult an Enterprise at the beginning of a most perilous War, in which it was hardly possible for him to succeed, there being at the same time an Army of 40.000 Turks encamped under the Walls of Buda, which was not many days March distant from Newhausel; and the Gross of the Turkish Power, not inferiour to the great∣est of their Armies, (of which Histories re∣count such prodigious numbers) were then marching under the command of the Grand Vizier, between Esseck and Alba Regalis, or Stultwessemburg. But we ought not to im∣pute any thing to the ill Conduct of so great a General, whose Successes having crowned all his Actions; nothing can seem Rash or void of Council, where Fortune hath always led him by the hand, and made him Victo∣rious, as we shall (God willing) make ap∣pear in the sequel of this History. The Grand Seignior at Belgrade.But before we proceed farther, we must add what before was omitted, that about the beginning of April, the Grand Seignior being desirous to show himself in his Army, began to move towards Belgrade,  where he arrived with his beloved Soltana, (who would not leave his Company) and with a splen∣did Court, on the 2d. of June. The gros∣sest part of the Army being by this time come to that place appointed for the general Rendezvous, the Grand Vizier, was wil∣ling to give the Grand Seignior a Survey of all his Forces, to let him see how he had employed his Treasure, and with what hopes of being repaid with Kingdoms, and with Spoils of the richest Dominions in Christen∣dom: And so the Grand Seignior being placed in a high Scaffold erected for that purpose, all the Soldiers in their several Ranks and Degrees, according to their Coun∣tries and Nations, passed in their several Orders before him. And in the first place, The Forces of Mesopotamia all on Horse∣back, Numb. 13000 Those of Assyria and Babilon, as far as Bal∣sora, 14000 Other Asiatick Troops, comprehending the Provinces Numbers of the Turkish Army.Of Sias, Amasia, Maras, Bussia, &c. 30000 The Militia of Judea, Egypt, &c. 18000 The Militia of Caramania, 8000 Turks out of the parts of Greece, 16000 The Militia of Armenia, Capadocia, &c. 24000 The remaining Asiatick Troops were from Georgia, and the conquered Countries there∣abouts, all which were the Forces out of Asia, and Horse, 28000 After these marched the Janisaries of Europe, 12000 Next followed the Tartars, ill Armed and worse Clothed, 14000 Last of all marched the most flourishing part of the Turkish Army, consisting of the Sons and Servants of Pashas; also of the richest Spahees, and other young Men, all richly cloathed and armed, 35000 Pioniers and others with Shovels, Spades, &c. 12000 Gunners, and other Attendants on the Train of Artillery, 13000 Attendants on the Waggons of Ammunition and Provision, 14000 Other Attendants on the Tents and Baggage, 13000 All which formidable Forces amounted un∣to, 264000 According to a Calculation made by seve∣ral Italian Writers; but as to my own Opi∣nion, I cannot believe that Asia could fur∣nish half those numbers, and therefore do rather follow the Computation of the Asia∣ticks, according to this Account: Mustapha Pasha, Grand Vizier, 15000 Emir Pasha of Adana, 500 Husaein Basha of Bolu, 330 Kara Mahomet Pasha of Diarbeker, 1500 Mustapha Pasha of Silistria, 1080 Halil Pasha of Sivas, 530 Ahmet Pasha of Maras, 710 Husaein Pasha of Aleppo, 950 Osman Pasha a Sangiac under him, 510 Husaein Pasha of Damascus, 2300 Hassan Pasha of Armit, 500 Bei of Gran Cairo, 3000 Basha of Tokai on the Borders of Persia, 340 Bekir Pasha, 500   27750 This Computation may very well agree with the Forces of the first Year's Expediti∣on out of Asia; to which being adjoyned the several Chambers of Janisaries, with all the European Forces both Horse and Foot, as also the Tartars, Transilvanians, Moldavi∣ans and Valachians, with the Hungarian Re∣bels; we may without Romance account the Ottoman Force to consist of a Hundred eighty Thousand effective fighting Men, be∣sides Miners, Pioniers, Sutlers, Gunners, At∣tendants on the Train of Artillery, Atten∣dants and Servants belonging to the Tents, with a vast number of Rascals, and Rab∣ble following the Camp, which may very well be Calculated to amount unto at least 40.000 more: For the Turks above any Na∣tion in the World have their Camp pestered
with the Incumbrances of Baggage; so that if we consider this vast number of 220.000 Men, it will not seem incredible what we find reported, that they spread the Coun∣try eight Leagues in length. The Report of this formidable, and as to human Appearance, invincible Army, cau∣sed the Duke of Loraine to hasten with all speed possible the Fortifications of Raab, which he designed to enlarge on some rising Grounds near to the Town, and to defend them with the whole Body of the Army, or at least by the Infantry, which having a Communication with the Garrison, might be able to oppose that great force of the Enemy, and weary them out by a lingring Siege in a Country, which was already be∣come desolate, and without Forage for a∣bove twenty Miles round. But the Duke of Loraine having received Intelligence,The Grand Vizier at Alba Re∣galis. that the Grand Vizier on the 1st. of July was entred into Alba Regalis, and certainly resolved to Besiege Vienna, and to stop at no other place on their March thi∣ther; He then changed his Measures, and having reinforced Raab, with the three Re∣giments of Baden, Grana and Souches, and given the command of the Place to Colo∣nel Wallis; and having also reinforced Comor∣ra and other Places with strong Garrisons, his whole Field-Army became reduced unto 24.000 Men only: And fearing lest with so small a number, he should be surrounded by the multitudes of the Enemy, he once resolved to encamp himself under the Can∣non of Vienna. In the mean time Tekeli having made a Visit to the Grand Vizier in his Camp at Alba Regalis, perswaded him to publish a Manifest,He publish∣es a Mani∣fest. signifying unto the People, That the Grand Seignior did take under his Pro∣tection all the Hungarians, who should joyn themselves to the Male-contented Party, and that he would maintain them in their Priviledges, Liberties, Estates, Laws, and Religion: And that such, who refused to accept this gracious Offer, were to expect no Quarter, but to be punished with Fire and Sword. This Manifest being divulged by Tekeli at his return from the Vizier to Cassovia, so operated on many of the Hun∣garians, that the Towns of Papa, Tot and Vesprin accepted of the same, and opened their Gate to Tekeli and his Party: And such was the Consternation of all Hungary, that many other Counties and Towns, declared to the Emperor's Commissioners, that they would open their Gates to Tekeli at the first Summons, rather than expose themselves to Fire and Sword, where was no hopes or ex∣pectations of Relief. This Declaration of the People, giving the Emperor just cause to fear, lest Neutra and the Mountain Towns should follow the same Example, Orders were given to Count Schultz, Governour of Neutra, to demolish that Fortress,Neutra de∣molished. and bring the gross Cannon, with all the Ammunition from thence; and the like Command was given to the Officers of the Mountain Towns, where the Mines of Silver were, it being impossible to relieve them, because Tekeli was Master of all the Passes which led thither; which Orders were readily o∣beyed by the Officers, Priests and Religious Men, who fled to the Camp of General Schultz on the Banks of the River Waagh: Where Schultz having joyned with the six Thousand Polish Horse, under the Command of Prince Lubomiski, he had the fortune to meet a Party of the Malecontents joyned with some Tartars, and to give them a total Defeat, killing and taking two Thou∣sand of them, with several Colours, and all their Baggage. In the mean time, whilest the Duke of Loraine was in this dubious Condition, not knowing what course was best to be taken, he resolved once to retire under the Cannon of Vienna, and there to go∣vern himself according to the Motion of the Enemy; but the Turks came on so fast, their Van appearing on the Banks of the River Raab, followed by the whole Body of their Army Marching in Bata∣lia, that there was no time for any thing but a Precipitous Flight; nothing was now to be put to a hazard, for the least Defeat might cause the absolute loss of Vienna, and open the Enemies way into the Hereditary Counties. In this exigency, all the Foot was Transported over into the Island of Schultz, under the Command of the Count de Zely; and all the Horse being about Nine thousand five hundred in num∣ber, Marched away about Midnight, and pitched their Camp near to Altembourg. The Infantry being in the Isle of Schultz,The Chri∣stian In∣fantry in the Isle of Schultz. Marched without danger of the Enemy, and were in the way either to Communi∣cate with Raab, or to give Succour to Vienna, according as they saw the Enemy bend their Course, for they were in a Condition to move faster than the multi∣tudes, and gross Bodies of the Turks. In a few Days it appear'd, that the Turks aimed at the Capital City of Vienna, and to leave all the other Fortresses behind them, as being places which would fall of them∣selves, and follow the Fate of the Imperial Court. The News of all which being carried from the Duke of Loraine by Count Caprara to the Emperor; and also, that the Baggage of the Duke of Saxelawenburg, of Prince Lewis de Baden, and of the Counts Caprara, and Montecuculi were all taken by the Turks, and their Convoy defeated; and that the
Horse in great disorder had abandoned the Infantry, and left them to shift for themselves in the Isle of Schultz, and were Marching with great Disorder to Vienna: No sooner was this Intelligence arrived, than the Tar∣tars appear'd at the same time within two Leagues of the City,The great consterna∣tion at Vienna. and set Fire to all the Villages round about, the Smoak of which ascending upwards, gave visible demonstra∣tions of the truth of these Reports, and put all the Court and City into a distracted Consternation. The Emperor after the com∣ing of this News, made no delay to de∣part away with the Empress, the Arch-Duchess, and all the Court for Lintz: There was now no time to spare; and Fear added Wings as well to the Poor as to the Rich; the great Personages whose Offices obliged them to an attendance on the Court, were to be excused from remaining behind in Defence of the City, the Duty they owed their Master disengaging them from show∣ing their Bravery in the Face of the Enemy: And indeed such were the Preparations of all sorts of People to hasten out of the Town, as if none had intended to stay in Defence of it:The Empe∣ror and Court re∣move to Lintz. The Court which at other times would have requir'd at least fifteen Days preparations for such a removal, was now consined to five or six Hours; so that without a larger Description of this Affright∣ment, we may imagin and figure to our selves, the Confusion there was in Vienna upon this Departure. Every Man before he could leave his Home, had something or other to order and dispatch; for which Reason the Emperor at Night had very few, or none to serve and attend him; and what will be thought most strange in times here∣after, he had no Guard, or Convoy to Defend his Person, through the many Perils and Hazards he was to pass, it being necessary to leave all the Soldiery behind for Defence of the City. We may then conceive with what Terrour this sad and trembling Court did travel, being continu∣ally allarum'd by reports of Tartars, who had Plunder'd and Pillaged, and Burnt all the Parts round, the terrible Marks of which appear'd in the Night, and served by the Flames to direct them in their way: And had not the Providence of God, car∣ried that rude and barbarous Nation into Parts more Remote, the Emperor and all his Court, with the Ladies, and Chief No∣bility had fallen as a Prey into their rapa∣cious Hands: But God having diverted so great a mischief and shame to all Christen∣dom, the Imperial Court arrived at Lintz, more terrify'd with the continual Allarums, then tyred with the Journey; the Atten∣dants followed the Court so fast as they were able, as did the Women, Citizens, and those who were not Men of the Sword; the ways were filled with Coaches, Carts, Waggons and Horses, the present trembling condition administred unto the flying Multitude, matter of discourse, so that as they journied along their Talk was con∣cerning the ill management of the publick Affairs, which were reduced to that un∣happy State by the evil Councils of the Jesuits, who had too great an Interest, and prevailing Power in the Cabinet of the Emperor: Had it not been for them, said they, and for the Clergy, the Protestants had not been divested of their Churches, nor deprived of their Liberties and Proper∣ties, whereby they were provoked to take up Arms against the Emperor: Nay, how often was the Imperial Clemency well inclined to grant Pardon, and Terms of Peace to Te∣keli, and his Malecontented Subjects; which would have diverted this Storm from the Turks, which now pursues us, but that the governing power of the Clergy still cherished, and fomented the Differences, until they had brought them to this ulti∣mate precipice of our Destruction? Some there were, who being well disposed to∣wards the French Faction, blamed the Councils of the Emperor, for not accept∣ing the Propositions of France made for re∣lief of the Empire: For thô such a remedy might be dangerous, yet it could not be worse than the Disease, nor nothing so had as the present impending Evil; it were bet∣ter to put our selves into the Hands of the French, than into the power of Turks and Infidels. The Court continued not long at Lintz; for so soon as Intelligence came that Vienna was Besieged, the Emperor remo∣ved to Passau, which is a City about 30 or 40 Miles farther into Germany; and was a Bishoprick, which with Strasbourg was once in the Hands of the Arch Duke Leo∣pold William. Two days after the depar∣ture of the Emperor from Vienna, the Con∣fusion still continued day and night, caused by Carts and Horses, employ'd to carry away the Goods and Housholdstuff of those who as useless Persons were permitted to remove out of the City. At length, upon arrival of the Duke of Loraine the Confusion ceased, and the In∣habitants and Soldiers affrightned before by the timorous multitude which were fled, began to return again into their Wits,Good Or∣ders and Rules esta∣blished. and become capable to receive Orders, and solid Councils for the better defence of their City, Estates and Lives. The Cour∣age and good Conduct which appear'd in the Generals, operated the like effect in the Minds of the Soldiery, who now with un∣daunted Resolution attended the approach
of the Enemy, who had in their March re∣ceived a Repulse before the Fortress of Raab, which gave no little encouragement to the Garrison. The same day that the Duke of Loraine and Count Staremberg enter'd into Vienna,  being the 13th of July, the Infantry which were before passed over into the Island of Schultz, were come up to the rest of the Army: The first thing ordered by these Commanders was, to repair the Palisadoes, and finish some Works as well as could be possible in so short a warning; and the Inhabitants of the Suburbs being retired within the Town, were willingly employ'd with their own Hands, to set Fire to their own Dwellings, to devest the Enemy of all Succour, or Shelter there∣in. The Forces put into Vienna.The same Night the Duke of Loraine caused all the Foot, excepting only eight Batalions, which he reserved to defend his Camp, to enter into the Counterscarp of the Town; and in two Nights after be∣ing the 14th and 15th, the Powder and Bullet, which was expected from Lintz were brought in, and lodged in the Arsenal of the City. After which the other eight Batalions were also brought into the Town, which with those in the Counterscarp made Twelve thousand Men. But for better understand∣ing the State and Condition of the Garrison,The num∣ber of the Forces brought in∣to Vienna. we have here set down the particulars of all the Forces therein, that those worthy Persons, who have so signalized themselves by their Bravery in this Famous Siege, may not be forgotten in future Ages. Count Staremberg Governour. Regiments of Staremberg Commanded by Geo. Maurice of Ketlin. 2000 Men. Half of Keiserstin's Regiment under Wol∣fargschenek, 1000 Mansfeld Commanded by C. Alex. Lesly, 2000 Souches by Charles Lewis Colonel of Sou∣ches, Son of the Famous General Rad∣wight, 2000 Schaffemberg, and Bercks two Regiments, 4000 Seven Companies of Newbourg, 1200 Half of Heister's Regiment, under Baron Heister, 1000 The other half of this Regiment was sent to Lintz, for Guard of the Emperor's Person. Five Companies of Dimik, an antient Com∣mander, 0600 Dupignis Regiment of Horse, 0600 Three Companies of the Garrison belonging to the City, 1200 These Regiments when full amounted in all unto 15600 Men; but so many of them had been Killed and wasted with Sickness, that scarce Ten thousand of them enter'd into Vienna; to which being added the Trained-Bands of the City, consisting of 2717, the whole Garrison might be well computed with Volontiers, and Officers at near 13000 Men. The Chief Officers were. Count Staremberg Governor, Count Daun, Lieutenant Governor, Marquis Ferdinand Obizzi Major, John Count Serini Assistant to the Count Daun; The Counts Souches and Schaffemberg Assistants to the Lieuten∣ant Governour and Major. Volontiers were Count Trotmandorf, who had been a Co∣lonel many years in Flanders, Count Five-Kerk Captain of the Provincial Circle of Austria, the Count of Salzbourg, who was Colonel of a Regiment of Croats, but being come to Vienna to be Cur'd of a Dissentery, which he had got in the Army, and the Siege happening before his perfect Reco∣very, he offer'd to serve in nature of a Volontier. The Baron of Kilmensec Great Forester to the Emperor, defended the Court-bastian for three days with eighty of his Foresters, who being excellent Marks-Men, and used to their Guns, which they charged with an exact proportion of Powder and Bullet, did great Execution up∣on the Turks, seldom missing their Shot, and the Baron himself killed a Turk at 300 paces distant; who was afterwards known to have been one of the Turks principal Canoniers. The Count Vignacourt a French Gentleman, formerly employed by his most Christian Majesty, in quality of an Ambas∣sador to Ferdinand the Third, Father of the present Emperor, and to other Princes of Germany, was, an other of the Volontiers: As were also the Count de St. Micaele a Venetian, Ernest Sigismund de Zeternz, of an antient Family in Silesia, Cornelius Rum∣mingken, a Person of Sixty two years of Age, and tho' much afflicted with the Gout, yet being an experienced Soldier, his Councils were more available to the Governour than his Bodily Services. And lastly, There was Sigismond de Reitoffar a Gentleman of Moravia, who had formerly been a Major General, who shewed himself at all times daring, and active in the Exe∣cution of such Orders, as he received from Count Staremberg the Governour. This was all the Force which was lodg∣ed in Vienna, to defend it against that For∣midable
Army, then ready to encompass it on all sides: But whom God will save are always well protected, and then there ne∣ver want Provisions nor Councils, nor Cou∣rage in the Soldiery. The Count of Kollonitz, who was Trea∣suerer of Hungary, did most seasonably furnish the Bishop of Newstadt,The Bishop of New∣stadt's Trea∣sure. with Five hundred thousand Florins for supply of the Garrison during the Siege, with Three thousand Measures of Wine; which this Bishop, who was a Knight of the Great Cross of Malta, and had been in the Siege of Candia, did with good mannagement lay up in several Cellars in the Town, and di∣stributed to the Soldiers in time of the Siege; as also the Money, which was paid out with such order, and on such occasi∣ons, as were requisite and necessary, to appease all complaints which might arise for want thereof. But above all, care was taken to establish a Council in the Town during the Siege: The Persons thereunto nominated and appointed were, The Coun∣cil appoint∣ed for Go∣vernment of Vienna.Count de Capliers Counsellor of State, and General of the Ordnance; Count de Mo∣lard, Grand Marshal of Austria, Baron de Belchamp, Councellor of the Emperor's Hous∣hold, and the Chancellor Hoffman. The Governours under Count Staremberg were the Counts of Thun and Serini; and after them Souches and Schaffemberg, Baron de Beck, the Prince of Wirtemberg, and Baron Heister, who were all Colonels of Regi∣ments which served in Vienna. By this time being the 14/4 of July, the Duke of Loraine having given all the neces∣sary Orders for conservation of the City; the Turks began to descend by the Hill of St. Mark with their Horses,The first appearance of the Turks. Waggons and Camels laden with Baggage, ranging them∣selves in form of a Crescent or Half-moon round the Town: Upon appearance whereof, and the News of the near approach of the Great Vizier; the Duke of Loraine on the 15th at night drew off all his Horse, and Dragoons to the other side of the Bridges, and there Encamped: He had once enter∣tained some Thoughts of conserving a part of the Foot in his Camp; but considering the great Force of the Enemy ready to sur∣round the City,The Duke of Loraine puts all his Foot in∣to Vienna. the largeness of the Works which were to be maintained, the distance of the Forces which were designed for its Relief, and the daily decay, and diminu∣tion of Soldiers in a long Siege; were suf∣ficient inducements to this Wise Comman∣der, to supply the City with all the Infan∣try without any reserve unto himself. How∣soever, he had once some Thoughts of po∣sting some of his Cavalry in the Tabor, to keep a Communication with the Town; but upon a true survey thereof, the Water was found to be Shallow in many places, and Fordable that Man and Horse could March into it in Rank and File, so that the Water being of no security to a Camp, the place was deserted:The Tabor. The Tabor is an Island in the Danube, of about a Mile and half in length, planted with Trees and Or∣chards, and full of Gardens, Fountains and Houses of Pleasure. The Tabor being judged no place for the Cavalry to Lodge in; the Duke of Loraine passed the Danube, leaving the Bridges to be defended by the Dragoons of General Schultz. By this time the Van-guard of the Turks were advanced, and great numbers of Tents pitched round the City: And the Vizier with the Gross of the Army was Marching to the Siege, having left the Pasha of Buda with Twelve thousand Men to block up Raab, where he remained until such time as he was Relieved by Apafi Prince of Transilvania, with some of Tekeli's Forces, and then he proceeded to the Siege of Vi∣enna.The Vizier in the Camp be∣fore Vi∣enna. On the 16th the Vizier enter'd the Camp, highly raised, and puffed up with assurances of finding the Gates of Vienna opened unto him, or at least to run over the Walls without much Opposition. His nu∣merous Force gave him a confidence of Suc∣cess, and his natural Pride suggested to him an Impossibility of being Overcome: The Country People nourished this Opinion in him by Reports, that all the Christian In∣fantry were shut up in the Isle of Schultz; that there was no force in the City, and the disorder and Confusion so great therein, that upon the first Summons they would open their Gates: Nor was the Report ill ground∣ed; for at that time the whole Garrison of Vienna did not consist of above Six hundred Men, of which the Vizier was well advi∣sed, and knew, that if he made but some more than ordinary hast with his Army, or detached a formidable Body to appear in sight of the Town, before the Duke of Loraine had Re-inforced the Garrison, and put all things into a Posture of Defence, the Gates might easily have been opened, and the City become the Prey and Reward of the Ottoman Soldiers. But this was not the Vizier's business, his desire was to gain and appropriate all the Riches unto himself, which was to be done only by Articles and Conditions of Surrender drawn, and agreed in the time of a formal Siege; and there∣fore he would neither hasten his Troops to take Possession of the City, before it was Reinforced, nor yet incourage his Men to Enter the Town by mere Force and Dint of Sword; which in the Opinion of the Soldiery, he might have done if when he Stormed the Works, he had pushed forward his Men to the utmost of their Mettle; so
that here we may observe, that his accursed Avarice, which had been the Ruine of so many Persons, was now the Cause of his own Destruction. The Vizier began to open his Trenches, about fifty Paces distant from the Counter∣scarp in the Suburbs of St. Ulric, or the Gar∣den of Madam Spina, where the rising of the Walks by the obscurity of the Night, gave them an advantagious ground for raising some Batteries; and in the Morning two Spahees were commanded to throw a Wri∣ting in a Linnen Bag into the Counterscarp,His Sum∣mons to the City. which they performed, running full speed with their Horses. The substance of which was this. These Presents are to make known unto you, the Generals, Governour, Soldiers and Noble Citizens of the City of Vienna, That according to the Orders, we have received from the most Happy, most Powerful, most Invincible and most Mighty Emperor of the Universe, our Master, who is the true Image of God living on the Earth, and who by the Grace and Favour of the Almighty, following the Example of our Prophet Mahomet Mu∣stapha, to whom be Glory and Honour, and Blessing, is by a Multitude of Miracles be∣come the Greatest Sovereign both of one, and the other World, and the Supreme Emperor of all Kings and Princes; hath sent hither his Armies which are without number, to the in∣tent that they shall take Vienna, and there Establish the Worship of our True Religion. And whereas it is a Principle of our Religion, above all things to Propagate the Musselmin Faith, as is expesly Commanded by the Law of our Holy Prophet; We do instantly exhort you, before we Unsheath our Terrible Cymi∣ters to Embrace our Holy Religion, and to suffer your selves to be instructed in the My∣steries thereof, by which you will find Salva∣tion to your Souls. And in case you will Sur∣render up the City, whether you be Young or Old, Rich or Poor, We assure you, that you shall with all security Live therein: And in case any of you shall desire to go forth, and Live in any other place, he shall have Per∣mission and Licence so to do, and shall be con∣voy d forth with his Goods and Substance, with his Wife and Children. And as to those who shall desire to remain behind, they may Live in the Town in such manner as they did before. But in case you are obstinate, and constrain us to take your City by Force, then will we spare no Person whatsoever: And we Swear by the Creatour of Heaven and Earth, who never had nor never shall have an Equal, that we will put all to the Sword, as is Commanded by our Holy Law, and will take your Goods and Estates, and carry away your Wives, and Children into Captivity. Pardon is only for them, who obey the Divine Ordinances. Given at the Emperor's Camp before Vi∣enna, the 8th of the Moon Regeb, and in the Year of the Prophet's Transmi∣gration, 1094. To these Summons no other Answer was Return'd, than by Cannon and a Vigorous Defence, and by a Bloody Conflict in the Suburbs in which the Turks were greatly worsted. The Courage of the Besieged, which was evidenced during all the time of the Siege was most eminently Signaliz'd at the beginning thereof; when the Scotch Convent of Benedictin Fryers, (which was a very stately Edifice) took Fire,A Fire in Vienna. and endangered the Arsenal, which was near adjoyning thereunto, and where Two thousand Barrels of Powder were lodged; but by the diligence of Young Staremberg, and the Officers of the Artillery, the Powder was all carried to some Remoter place: And it pleasing God by his Gracious Providence, to cause the Wind to blow the Flames to o∣ther Quarters, the Arsenal was preserved and all the Ammunition therein, tho' sever∣al great Edifices, and Palaces thereunto adjoyning were consumed before the Fire was extinguished. The Original of this Fire was attributed to the Treachery of a Youth of 16 Years of Age habited in Girls Cloathing; whom the People in their Fury tearing to pieces, prevented the Discovery of this Treacherous and Horrid Plot. The Turks all this while with much Joy beheld the Flames ascending from the City, and ply'd their Cannon and Bombs towards that part, which at first broke in the Air without other Execution; and the better to prevent the accident by Fire, Count Sta∣remberg order'd the Roofs off all those Houses to be taken off which were cover'd with Shingles, and apt to take Fire with the least Spark. This was a terrible beginning of a Siege, and such as was sufficient to∣tally to dismay the Spirits of the Defen∣dants, but that they were supported with more than ordinary Courage inspired into them by the Providence of Heaven. All this while the Cavalry maintained their Stations at the Foot of the Bridges, to keep a Communication so long as was possible with the Town, and hinder the Passage of the Turks into the Isles of Leo∣polstadt, the which Action the Duke of Loraine committed to the Care and Con∣duct of General Schultz, and Prince Lubo∣miski, whilest he with the greater part of the Army retir'd to Langenzendorf: But the Turks, and Tartars with a very great num∣ber coming to force the Pass, carrying the Foot on their Horses behind them, and Wading over the Water, which was Foard∣able on all sides, were received with such
a Welcome as cost the Lives of most of those, who were the most forward to gain the Pass;The Chri∣stians for∣ced from the Bridges. but the numbers of the Ene∣my encreasing, the Christians found them∣selves not able to sustain the shock, and therefore having burnt and destroyed all the Houses thereabouts, they orderly retired to the Army, having broken the Bridges to prevent the more hasty pursuit after them. The Turks having by this time encompas∣sed the whole City with their numerous Camp,The Turks batter the City. and Tents of diverse colours, ad∣vanced their Trenches within thirty Paces of the Counterscarp, on the side of the Ba∣stions of the Court and the Lobel, and con∣tinually so plyed that Quarter with their Cannons and Morters, that they entirely ruined the Emperor's Palace, with the Hou∣ses and Churches thereunto adjoyning. Whilst Count Staremberg was busied in all places to give necessary Orders, and pro∣vide against every Misfortune which might happen,Staremberg wounded. he was unluckily wounded by the Blow of a Brick upon his Head, which had been carried by the stroak of a Cannon-shot, which confined him to his Chamber for three Days, and the Count Daun, one of the De∣puty Governours was sick at the same time of a Fever: However the care of the Counts Serini, Souches and Scaffenberg was such, that the Enemy gained no advantage by the absence of those Governours. Whilst Matters were thus acting in the City,C. Leslie sent to Krembs. Count Leslie was sent to Krembs to convoy the Train of Artillery thither, and attend the coming of the Auxiliary Troops of Bavaria, Saxony and Franconia, and the Regiments which were marching from seve∣ral other Places of the Empire; and also to restrain the Incursions of the Tartars into Austria, who with much Violence and Cru∣elty laid all Places, wheresoever they came, in Bloud and Ashes, thô many of them were cut to pieces in divers Conflicts, there being a Hundred and fifty of them killed by the Peasants, who were felling the Trees about Vienna, to hinder and disturb the March of the Enemy. But why the Tar∣tars should destroy all the Villages and Pro∣visions near to Vienna, whereby they depri∣ved the Turkish Army of all Provisions and Subsistence from parts near unto their Camp, and caused their Horse to fetch Forage at twenty Miles distance, no sound Reason can be given, unless it be, that those People having always been used to Spoyl and De∣struction, have it not in their Power, and nature to leave any thing unblasted, and not consumed in the Country of an Enemy wheresoever they pass. Some Troops be∣longing to General Schultz had the fortune at the same time to take a considerable Con∣voy of the Turks, consisting of above three Hundred Waggons, killing on the place about six Hundred and fifty, and taking two Hundred Prisoners. The Turks had drawn two parallel Lines, one on the side of the Court-Bastion,The Dispo∣sition of the Turkish Force. and another on the Lobel-Bastion, with a Line of Communication between both; and here they raised their Batteris of thirty Pie∣ces of Cannon: And thô Vienna was fortifi∣ed with eleven Bastions, yet three of them only were attacked, so that the whole Force of the Town was drawn that way for its Defence. The Grand Vizier took his Sta∣tion on the side of the Ravelin, and with him the Janisar-Aga, or General of the Ja∣nisaries, named Kara Mustapha, and his Ka∣hia or Lieutenant, and also the Pasha of Romelia, who was killed with a Cannon-shot. The Attack of the Court-Bastion on the Right-hand of the Vizier was committed to Chusaein, Pasha of Damascus, who thô he was a stout Man, and a good Soldier, yet he had been unfortunate, having formerly been beaten by Prince Ragotski in Transil∣vania, by Count Souches, at Leventz (as we have at large described in the former part of our History) and by the King of Poland at Coczim. The Bastion of the Lo∣bel on the Left-hand of the Vizier was com∣mitted to Achmet, Pasha of Temeswaer, who died on the 3d. of September of a Dissente∣ry; he had formerly executed the Office of High Treasurer, and after his decease, Hu∣saein Pasha, who also had been Treasurer, was promoted to his Place. In describing this Siege, it will not be necessary to re∣count all the particulars of the Traverses, Mines, Countermines, and other minute Actions, provided (as we intend) we do not omit any considerable Passage, or Feats of Arms, which were most memorable thrô the whole course of this Siege. Count Starembergh observing that the Turks worked continually in their Lines, re∣solved to obstruct them by a vigorous Sally,The Besieg∣ed make a Sally. for which the Besieged having now lost all their Fears, were very forward to do: The Sally was managed by one Sampson Steim∣bach, a Captain in the Regiment of Mans∣feldt, and Count Guy of Staremberg, who signa∣lized themselves with such Valour and Suc∣cess, that they killed many of the Miners, and brought in a Prisoner alive, who dis∣covered many Particulars then acting by the Enemy. On the 23d. of July, the Turks taking the advantage of a strong Gale of Wind, which blew towards the City, to throw diverse Bombs thereinto, one of which beat down the Spanish Embassador's House, with little other damage to the Town. The same day in the Afternoon the Turks sprang a Mine near the Lobel Bastion, but it taking vent,
reversed on themselves, damaging only a corner of the Bastion, and over-turning some Palisadoes, which were repaired again in the Night; howsoever the Turks took this opportunity to make a furious Assault upon that Bastion, but were valiantly re∣pulsed, with the loss of two Hundred Men killed, and three taken Prisoners. About the same time, a Messenger from the Duke of Loraine having swam four times over the Water,A Messen∣ger from the Duke of Loraine. with his Letters in a Blad∣der hanging about his Neck, with much dif∣ficulty got into the Town, which brought them the happy and encouraging News of being speedily relieved; for that all the Troops of the Circles, and of the Empe∣ror's hereditary Countries, came daily to the general Rendezvous at Krembs; and that the King of Poland with his Army was come as far as Olmutz. Nor were the Troops of the Duke of Loraine idle all this time during the Siege, but making Incursions and enter∣prizing some Design or other every Day, brought many Prisoners into the Camp with their Horses and other Booty: But the joy of these Successes were not a little damped by the News that the City of Presburg with Timavia, Emdemburg, Prekalla, Leita and Haisentat, being dismayed by the formidable Force of the Vizier, had submitted them∣selves to Tekeli, and to his Protection. Howsoever considering Men reflected, that such Accidents as these were to be expected, where a mighty Army predominated; and were as easily reversed by the turn of a con∣trary Fortune, and that they would follow the Fate and Success of Vienna. The 25th. of this Month, the Duke of Loraine receiving Intelligence, that Tekeli had formed an Army of 20 .000 Malecon∣tents, and eight Thousand Turks under the Command of the Pashas of Waradin and Pest, and designed to Besiege the Castle of Presburg;Debates a∣bout the Relief of Presbourg. which being a Place of consider∣able Consequence, was a Matter of long Debate, whether in that Conjuncture it was to be relieved in despight of all the Difficul∣ties and Obstacles which appeared to the contrary. For in the first place it was al∣ledged, that the Ways thither were rocky, woody, and inclosed, that the Forces of the Enemy were much superior to theirs in num∣ber; and that the Army ought not to be put into any hazard of being Defeated, at a time when the Relief of Vienna was the main and ultimate Design. To these Argu∣ments it was urged, that in case the Castle of Presburg was surrendred to the Enemy, it would facilitate a Communication between their two Armies, and hinder the conjuncti∣on of the Polish Army with the Imperial, unless they took a large compass about, which would both harrass the Men by a long March, and defer the Relief of Vienna; the Extremities of which required nothing more than Hast and a speedy Succour. These last Reasons prevailed above the former, it being esteemed of absolute necessity to con∣serve the Castle of Presbourg, the which was wavering, and ready with the other Towns to accept and embrace the Protection of Te∣keli. In pursuance of this Resolution,The Duke of Loraine secures Presbourg. the Duke of Loraine passed the Danube with his Horse and Dragoons, namely, the Re∣giments of Palsi, Caprara, Rabata, Gondola, Taff, Merci, Hallewiel, Montecuculi, Vetera∣ni and Gots, which were all Horse, to the number of eight Thousand; and of Dra∣goons, those of Stirum, Schultz and Herber∣viller, making in all an Hundred thirty six Troops and Companies, besides the Poles under Lubomiski, which made about two Thousand Men more. In the Night Prince Lewis of Baden and the Baron of Merci, were Commanded in the Van to secure the narrow Ways and Passages; and being come upon certain Hills, where they see round about, they discovered the Enemies Fires and Lights below in the Plains, and two Camps at some little distance one from the other; of which, Advice being given to the General, Prince Lewis of Baden was or∣dered to Attack the Suburbs of Presbourg, where some of the Malecontents were quar∣tered; upon this Surprise, the Malecontents flying into the Town, made way for the Imperialists to enter without much Resi∣stance: The City being in a suddain conster∣nation, upon sight of the Imperial Army at their Gates, surrendred upon Summons, as did also the Castle; the Garrison where∣of, whilst the Town was in Treaty, esca∣ped out to seek for Refuge in the Camp; but many of them were intercepted in their Passage, and cut to pieces. This happy success in sight of the E∣nemy was an evidence of their Weakness and want of Courage, and animated the Christians to give them Battle: The Prince Lewis of Baden with his Dragoons, was hereupon as ordered, drew up in the Vine∣yards and Gardens adjoyning to the Su∣burbs, and extended his whole Body to the right and left, along the Danube to the foot of the Hill, the better to secure C. Caprara, whilst he with his Horse descended down by the Vineyards, and had drawn up in Ba∣talia. The Enemy made a show as if they in∣tended to fight, and detached some Parties to begin a Skirmish, but the Duke of Lo∣raine would not Engage, until all his Forces were drawn up; upon appearance whereof the Malecontents changed their Minds,The Male∣contents are put to . and instead of advancing, the Imperialists per¦ceived, by a great Dust rising on one side
and the other, that the Enemy retired: The advanced Parties of the Enemy, which were to begin the Battle, finding themselves abandoned by the main Body, turned their backs and fled; and were hardly pursu'd by the Imperialists and Poles, with much loss and slaughter, until they came to a great Wood, with a stream of Water running by it, where they made a Stand; but a de∣tached party of Poles, with some Squa∣drons of Germans, and some of the Regiment of Palsi charged them with such Vigour and Bravery as put them to a Rout, so that they killed about five or six Hundred of them, and took about twelve Hundred Waggons of Baggage, and pursued them so hotly to∣wards Tirnau, that many of them saved themselves in the Woods, and others threw themselves into the Danube; the Affrightment and Disorder was so great through the whole Army, that they recovered not themselves until they had passed the Waagh. Discontent between the Turks and Tekeli.Tekeli having Intelligence of the March of the Imperialists, by the Party which had been beaten the Evening before; he retired in the Night-time, with a great Body of his own Horse and Foot, (leaving very few of his Men with the Turks) and resolved to at∣tend the Duke of Loraine's coming, and to fall upon him; which occasioned that Quar∣rel and Misunderstanding between the Male∣contents and the Turks, that they separated each from other, and acted apart, until they were reconciled, and again united by Medi∣ation of the Vizier, as appeared by certain Letters, which were intercepted. But to return again to the Siege: In the mean time, whilst these things were acting a∣broad, there was continual firing and shooting on both sides; and on the 26th. the Turks de∣signing to make a furious Assault, caused all their warlike Musick, such as Flutes, Cym∣bals, and brass Trumpets, which give a shrill Sound, to play with their highest Notes, to encourage their Soldiers to make the On-set; but just as they were beginning, the Besie∣ged gave Fire to a Mine,A Mine sprang by the Besieg∣ed. which made ma∣ny of the Turks to take capers and frisks in the Air, according to the Measures of their Musick. But the Turks not dismayed hereat, prest hard to gain that Ground which the Mine had laid open, but were valiantly re∣pulsed by those who had the Guard of that Place: Howsoever, the Matter was long in dispute, until Count Serini, and St. Croix Lieutenant Colonel of Dupigni's Regiment of Horse came in with some Granadiers to their Relief, and forced the Assailants back again into their Trenches, leaving many of their Companions dead upon the place, whose Heads the Christians afterwards fixed upon Poles, and exposed 'em to the View of the Turkish Camp. Howsoever, this Acti∣on was not performed without some loss and hurt to the Besieged, for Count Guy of Staremberg and Count Souches were wound∣ed: George Misnier, General of the Artillery,Several of the Christi∣ans killed. had his Arm broken by a Shot, of which he died in a few days afterwards, to the great Sorrow of the whole City, which could not but miss a Person so excellent in his Art, having been Ingenier at the Siege of Philipsbourg, in the Troops of the Mar∣quess of Baden: In this Action also were killed Baron Walter, Lieutenant Colonel of the Regiment of Wirtemberg, and William Schemnitz, a Captain in the Regiment of Staremberg; as also Baron Dubski, who was shot through both his Buttocks with a Mus∣quet Bullet; and the Governour, Starem∣berg himself, was again wounded in the Hand with the stroak of a Stone, as he had before been in the Head. The Turks having this Day intercepted a Letter, which the Governour had sent by an express Messenger to the Duke of Lo∣raine, to give an account of the state of the Town; the Vizier, that he might give no∣tice thereof unto Staremberg, he caused the same Paper to be fastned to an Arrow, and shot into the Town, with an additional Letter from the Vizier, wrote in Latin to this Effect: That it was to little purpose for the Besieged to write in Characters unto the Duke of Lo∣raine to render him an account of the ill Con∣dition of their Town,A Letter shot into the Town. since the same is suffi∣ciently known to the Besiegers, without any Key or Explanation of the Cypher. Howsoe∣ver the Grand Vizier, out of compassion to the Creatures of God, had already offered them his Mercy; but that being rejected by the Be∣sieged, he thought fit to let them know, that the time was now come, in which they were to feel the rigour of the Divine Indignation, which would cause them, tho' late, to repent of this their inflexible Obstinacy. This Let∣ter being read among the Officers, moved Laughter, rather than occasioned Fear. As the Besieged continued still in good heart within the Town, so the Duke of Loraine's Camp received a double Encou∣ragement from two happy Successes: The first was, That the Bano, or Lord Lieute∣nant of Croatia, had conserved that People in their Loyalty and Devotion towards the Emperor, and for Security thereof, had made them to enter into a solemn Oath: But that of a greater Importance, was, That General Dunewald had again defeated a Body of two or three Thousand Tartars,A Body of Tartars de∣feated. with the slaughter of about thirteen Hun∣dred killed upon the place, and many Pri∣soners taken, besides all their Baggage and Booty which they had plunder'd in Hun∣gary and Austria. Within the Town they were forming and contriving all Ways and
Instruments for their Defence; and amongst the rest, they had forged a certain Weapon in manner of a Scyth of about six Foot in length besides the Handle, which proved of excellent Use and Effect against the Scy∣meters, and would cut off a Man at the middle without much difficulty, and some times take off four or five Heads at a stroak. The 28th. the Turks attempting to make themselves Masters of the Counterscarp, on the side of the Court-Bastion and Lobel, sprang a Mine,A mine sprang by the Turks. which they had prepared on that Quarter; but it being not far enough advanced, it reached not the Palisadoes, howsoever, about twenty Soldiers were killed, besides several wounded. The 29th▪ about five a Clock in the morn∣ing, the Besieged fired sixty Pieces of Can∣non upon the Enemy, which they modest∣ly answered with one single Gun; but in the Afternoon they stormed the Palisadoes with great fury,The Turks repulsed. but were repulsed with much loss; in which Action, the new-invented Scyths were very serviceable, and did great execution on the Assailants, amongst which Kara Mahomet Pasha of Mesopotamia was wounded in the Thigh, as also the Gebegee Basha, who is chief of the Armourers, and the Vizier's Kahya or Deputy was killed and buried at the entrance into his own Tent. On the 30th. Count Staremberg fired a Mine, which as believed did great executi∣on on the Enemy, for that they employed the whole Day following in repairing the Damage which that Mine had caused. The 31st. the Turks advanced their Tren∣ches so near to the Counterscarp, that the two Parties could speak and discourse one with the other, and fight at Arms end, and with the Stakes of the Palisadoes, which they had plucked up; but the Defendants with their long iron Crooks, such as we use for pulling down Houses, in the time of Fire, caught up the Bodies of Men, and drew them over the Walls, and with one cut of their Scyths would Mow off three or four Heads at a stroak. The Turks finding themselves greatly in∣commoded in their Trenches by the Bombs and Granadoes, which were shot from the Town,The Turks cover their Trenches. contrived ways to cover them with Beams of Timber, over which they laid Sacks of Earth, which kept off all Fire∣works, Cannon and Musquet-shot; and in many places of the Trenches they made Pavements of Brick, which were so com∣modious and secure, that the Grand Vizier, and many of the principal Officers and Pashas lodged therein, with as much convenience as in their own Houses. August 3d.On the 3d. of August the Turks having raised their Trenches much higher than the Counterscarp, began a Fight against the Defendants with Musquets and Arrows, which they continued for a long time, and relieved their Men often, with new Sup∣plies, but were always bravely repulsed by the Christians. Towards the Evening, the Turks endeavoured to gain the Counterscarp of the Court Ravelin by Assault; and with much Bloud, after a vigorous Defence, they took it: The Pasha of Damascus was killed in this Action. The Turks, encouraged with this Success,4th. the next Day pursued their Fortune with re∣doubled Force, and attacked the Counter∣scarp, at the Gate of the Lobel-Bulwark, with such fury, that with the loss of four Hundred of their Men, they became Ma∣sters of it. And then on the 5th. they threw into the Ditch of the Ravelin,5th. such quantity of Fag∣gots and Sacks of Earth, as served to fill it up; but yet the Turks possessed not long this spot of Ground, for that very Night they were driven from that Post with great loss by the Valour of the Defendants, and Diligence of the Governour, who was all that Night upon the Works, and took no repose until four a Clock in the Morning. On the 6th. about nine a Clock in the Morning, the Turks sprang a Mine,6th. which opened the Earth very much in the Counter∣scarp, towards the Court-Bastion, and there∣with began a terrible Fight, which continu∣ed for the space of five Hours; during which time the Christians lost about a Hun∣dred Men killed and wounded, amongst which was Count Leslie, Lieutenant Colo∣nel of the Regiment of Mansfelt,C. Leslie the young∣er Slain. and Bro∣ther of General Leslie, who at first being wounded in the Arm maintained his Ground, not retiring so much as to be dressed, but still continued the Fight, until being shot in the Breast with a Musquet Bullet, he died under the Walls of the City with much Glory; but notwithstanding all this Valour of the Defendants, the Turks crouded on their Soldiers in such multitudes with con∣tinual Supplies, that like a violent Torrent,The Turks gain the Counter∣scarp. not being to be withstood, they became Masters of the Ditch of the Counterscarp of the Court Ravelin, at the cost of the Lives of six Hundred and Seventy of their Men, and that Day in all were a Thousand Turks killed, and about a Hundred and eighty Christians. On the 7th. the Centinel,7th. that was pla∣ced on the top of the Steeple of St. Stephens, gave notice, about five a Clock in the morn∣ing, that he discovered a great Smoak ari∣sing on the farther side of the Danube, which continued until eight that Morning, and af∣terwards vanished; the Governour rightly
conjectur'd, that the Smoak was caused by some Fight between the Christians and Turks: The truth of which was the next day brought by a Rascian, (who was of that Province which produces excellent Spies) and he re∣lated, That the Turks having detached a Party of about Three thousand Horse, to make a Discovery of the State of the Duke of Loraine's Camp, and see what numbers were come in from Saxony, Suabia and Franconia. Upon advices of their March an Ambuscade was laid for them, into which they unwarily falling, the greatest part of them were slain, and an Aga, and Tekeli's Secretary, an Hungarian Count, were made Prisoners:A Party of Turks defeated. And also, That they had taken many of the Enemies Waggons laden with Ammunition and Provisions, and that upon this Success, divers of the Malecontents had deserted their Party, and were gone unto the Emperor. The same day the Turks Sprang a Mine on the side of the Lobel Bastion, which reversed on them∣selves, with the same loss and hurt which they design'd for the Christians. 8th.On the 8th, the Christians thunder'd their Cannon from the Curtain of the Ca∣rinthian Bulwark, which ruined some of the Works of the Besiegers, and Dismoun∣ted their Cannon: Howsoever, the same Day the Turks Sprang a Mine, just at the Point of the Court Bastion, by which twenty three Christians were killed. But what in this matter is strange and worthy to be remembred, a certain Gunner was tossed up into the Air by force of this Mine, and thrown into the Ditch of the Town with∣out any hurt, to the great wonder of all those who were Spectators thereof. The Turks seconded the Mine with an Assault, and began to remove the Earth under the Ravelin, and to cover the Galleries with Beams and Earth, by which they descended into the great Ditch, without receiving any damage either by Cannon or Granados; so that the Governour judging it impossible to defend that Ravelin,A Sally from the Town. caused the Cannon to be withdrawn from thence: Howsoever, the Counts of Daun, and Souches (the Go∣vernour being Sick of a Dyssentery) made a Sally that Night at the Head of Three hundred Men, and Charged the Enemy so Vigorously, that they drove them out of their Galleries, and burnt all their Works. 9th.On the 9th, the Turks fired a Mine on the side of the Ravelin, which killed five Soldiers, and over-turned some Palisadoes; but a greater damage was thereby done to the Turks, who by a reverse lost Thirty two of their own Men, and the Palisadoes were again repaired in the Night. 10th.On the 10th, a strong Party of Horse under the Command of the Count Sara their Colonel, defeated Two thousand Malecontents bonging to Bdiani, near Fristenfelden,A  of Turks and Ma¦contents dfeated. killed Four hundred and eighty upon the place, took above Three hundred Prisoners, with five Colours. In like man∣ner a Party of Germans belonging to the Garrison of Raab, under Colonel Heisler, meeting with a Body of Turks and Teke∣lites near Altemberg, which were Convoy∣ing Waggons laden with Ammunition and Provisions to the Turkish Camp before Vienna, Charged them so furiously that they totally Defeated them, and put them to Flight, and in the Pursuit killed them with great Slaughter; an Hundred and eighty Waggons were taken; but those which were laden with Powder, and Fire works were blown up, rather than they should become a Prey to the Enemy, and be made use of against themselves. The same Day the Turks Sprang a Mine at the Point of the Lobel Bastion, which tossed three Christian Soldiers into the Air; and set them down again in the same place upon their Legs without any hurt: But it proved of much greater mischief to the Turks by its reverse upon themselves. All that Day many Can∣non shot were fired on both sides; and the Besieged threw many Bombs out of their Morter-pieces into the Enemies Trenches, which did considerable Execution. The Scholars of the University in Vi∣enna, whose Motto might be Tam Marti quàm Mercurio, finding this no time for Books, apply'd their Minds to the War, for preser∣vation of their Lives, City and Christian Religion, against the Common Enemy of the Faith: And forming themselves into a Body,The Scho∣lars and Merchants become Sol∣diers. made two or three very good Companies. The Merchants also of the Society of Ne∣therlanders following their Example, raised a Company of Two hundred and eighty Men, all Armed with Fire-locks, which they maintained at their own cost and charge; and being used in their Common exercises to shoot with Guns, they became excellent Marks-men; and from the upper Rooms of the Emperor's Palace, where they were commonly Quarter'd, they did good Service, annoying the Turks greatly with their Shot; nor were the Scholars less ex∣pert than the Merchants, for one of them having shot a Janisary dead with his Mus∣quet, he drew his Body within the Palisa∣does with one of the long Hooks, and cut off his Head, which at the end of a Pike he carried through the City; and having ript open his Stomach, he found there six Ducats in Gold, which he had swallowed; supposing that part to be the most secure, and the most private Purse, free from the Robbery either of his Friends or Enemies: It seems, it was known afterwards, that
this was the Common way of Concealment of Gold amongst the Turkish Soldiers; which when the Imperialists discover'd, they made it a common practice to dive into the Entrails, of as many as they took: Examining their Bowels like the antient Au∣gurs, who Inspected the inwards of Beasts, to make their presages of good, or bad Fortune. 11th.On the 11th, the Turks Sprang two Mines without any great effect; howsoever it ser∣ved them for a Signal to make an Assualt; but the Defendants making use of their smaller Guns, or Field-pieces planted on the Walls, charged with Chain and Par∣tridge shot, with Spars and pieces of old Iron, which together with Hand-Granadoes made such a Slaughter amongst the Turks, as caused them to Retire. Howsoever, Forty of the Defendants were killed and wound∣ed. 12th.The next day the Turks about Noon fired another Mine, which blew up one of the Flankers of the Ravelin, with so much noise and thunder, as gave an Allarum to the whole Town, and caused the Officers, who were than sat down at Table to arise and leave their Dinner, to see what the matter was. The Turks were ready hereupon to have made the Assault, but finding that the Breach was not wide enough, they retired again within their Trenches. 13th.Howsoever, still continuing their Works, they at length on this day blew up the whole Ravelin; howsoever the quantity of Powder being very great, the Mine rever∣sed upon themselves with such Execution, as abated the Courage of the most bold Assailants. 14th.On the 14th, having sunk their Trenches nine Foot deep, they endeavoured to pene∣trate a Way into the Ditch, and about six a Clock in the Evening they Sprang another Mine on the right Hand of the Ravelin, with as little success as the Day before. The Chri∣stian Camp in∣creases.In the mean time the Christian Camp daily increased to such numbers, as were judged sufficient to give Battail to the Ot∣toman Army; but to make the Game more secure, it was judged necessary to attend the coming of the King and Army of Po∣land: To hasten which, diverse Messengers were sent, to desire his Majesty to expe∣diate and quicken his March, lest he should come too late for the Relief of Vienna, whose Forces every Day diminishing by con∣tinual losses, could not possibly hold out long, thô they were well assured, that the utmost Extremity would be sustained, before the Defendants would yield to a Surrender. The Polish King being sensible hereof, pro∣mised to hasten his March, so as to be at Krembs on the 28th of the Month. The 15th and 16th, the Turks continued to Batter, and to throw Bombs into the Town, and Sprang several Mines,15th. and 16th. thô not with much Execution; and were in divers Assaults vigorously repulsed. Howsoever, all this was done at the expence of much Blood, and with the diminution both of the numbers and strength of the Garrison, which by hourly losses on the Breaches, on the Works, and by Sicknesses caused by the want of good Diet, was much decayed, and the Defendants were reduced to that low Condition, that they could not long sustain the violence of so forcible an Enemy. And thô the Turkish Camp was not free from Diseases and Mortality, yet they were less sensible of their losses by their numbers, and the daily Recruits which they received. To make known the true state of the City to the Duke of Loraine, some crafty and bold Men undertook to be the Messengers,A Messen∣ger sent to the Duke of Loraine. some of which were intercep∣ted, and others escaped; amongst the rest one Francis Koltchizki alias Kotlenski, who was Interpreter to the Levant or Eastern Company, being perfectly practised in the Turkish Language, undertook to carry un∣to the Duke of Loraine, not only Letters but also by word of Mouth, to inform him of the true State and Condition of the Town. Accordingly Kotlenski having disguised himself in the Turkish Habit, silently passed through the Palisadoes, and enter'd into the Camp, where with much Confidence he set up his Throat, and be∣gan to Sing with the highest Notes of the Turkish Air; no Man suspected him in the least kind, and an Aga observing a Fellow pass so merrily by his Tent, called him in, and for his good Humour enter∣tain'd him with Coffee. After which with∣out any Examination he proceeded on his way, and passed the Mountain of Kulem∣berg; and being descended down to the side of the Danube, some of the Christian Soldiers Fired at him from an Island, but having made it known to them by certain Signs, that he was a Messenger sent from Vienna, he was kindly received, and con∣ducted with expedition and safety to the Duke of Loraine, to whom with great sin∣cerity, he gave a true and exact Relation of the State of Vienna; and delivered his Letters, one of which of the 4th of the Month, was from the Deputies of the Coun∣cil of State;The Duke of Loraine receives Letters from Vi∣enna. two of the 8th from the Counts de Staremberg and Capliers; and one of the 12th from Capliers; all which gave an Account of the Siege, and of the ad∣vances of the Enemy upon them, and the necessity of the place, with a List of those who were killed and wounded, concluding with earnest desires for speedy Relief;
that Count Staremberg was very Sick, and weakned by a Dissentery, and that they began to be in want of Granadoes. The Duke of Loraine was very careful to inform the Emperor, the King of Po∣land, the Electour of Saxony, and all Per∣sons concerned, of the Condition of Vi∣enna: And dispatched Count Caraffa to the King of Poland, praying him to order the March of General Sinariski, who with some advanced Troops had been six days in Si∣lesia. And that Vienna might not in the mean time languish for want of hopes, and information of the care which was taking to Succour and Relieve them; the Duke of Loraine having commended the resolu∣tion of the Messenger,Answers returned. and promised him a Reward agreeable to the hazard of such an undertaking, so soon as the City should be delivered from the Siege, he dispatched him away with a full Answer to all De∣mands. Kotlenski return'd with the same Confidence, as before to the Turkish Camp; and privately stoal into the City through the Palisadoes, where he was received with all the Joy, which distressed Men could express to one, who brought them the comfortable hopes of a speedy Deliverance. Many Questions (we may believe) were put to him by all sorts of People, and in all places and Companies where he was; and in all of them he infused Heart and Spirit, by the Relations he gave of the increase of the German Army, of the Pre∣parations which were making, and of the near approach of the King of Poland. Kot∣lenski was not absent above four Days be∣fore he return'd; and what Intelligence he gave, was confirm'd by the Letters he brought from the Duke of Loraine to Count Staremberg, signifying that he had defeated Tekeli near Presbourg; and taken a Con∣voy with all sorts of Ammunition, and Provision designed for the Ottoman Camp, and that the King of Poland was upon his March for Relief of the City. This News was entertain'd with a General Joy, certi∣fy'd by Ringing of Bells, and Firing all the Cannon of the Town, and Vollies of small shot upon the Enemy; and for a Signal to the Duke of Loraine that his Let∣ters were come to Hand, Three Rockets were fired from the top of St. Stephen's Steeple. The Turkish Camp in want of Forage.The Tartars had destroy'd all the Coun∣tries round, that the Turkish Horse were almost Famished for want of Forage: Nor was there any to be procured within two or three days Journey of the Camp; but the necessity was such, that the Vizier de∣tached a Party of our or five thousand Horse, to fetch in Provender from Paris far Remote: And it is , That so great was their want, that they were forced to strip the Trees of their Leaves, for the pre∣sent nourishment and sustenance of their Horses, for which they were beholding to their Friends the Tartars. On the 17th, the Turks raised a new Battery of three Pieces of Cannon,17th. against the Bastion Lobel, but they were soon dis∣lodged: Howsoever, between seven and eight a Clock in the Evening, the Turks fired a Mine under the Breach of the Ra∣velin, intending to make an Assault,A Mine fired. but it was too hot work, the resistance being great, they were droven back into their Tren∣ches. On the 18th,18th. the Defendants consulted how to dispossess the Turks, of the Quar∣ters they had taken at the Foot of the Ravelin: But whilst they were considering thereof, the Turks Sprang a Mine under the Ravelin,Another Mine sprung. which carried away all the Front of it towards the side of the Town; and immediately planted twelve Colours on the Ruins, with Resolution to make an Assault: To prevent which Count Dupigni with Sixty Men made a Sally, but pressing too forward into the Enemies Works, he was shot into the Belly with a Musquet Bullet, of which he died on the place, with Twenty four of his Soldiers and eight wounded, and also the Marquis of Chauville was killed. The Governour to relieve this small Party, ap∣pointed a Sally of Three hundred Men; which having passed without the Works, perceived a formidable Body of Turks ready to Attack them, at which being dismaied they refused to advance, and crouding back at the Sally Port, where but one Man could enter a-breast, they were in such dis∣order that the Turks killed many of them, and had made a far greater Slaughter, had not Count Schaffemberg with those few that were with him, covered and defended the Retreat; in this Action the Turks lost Four hundred Men, and the Defendants about Forty five. On the 19th, the Defendants Sprang a Mine,19th▪ and 20th. A Mine sprung by the Defen∣dants. which totally over-threw all the Enemies Works on the side of the Ravelin, and bu∣ried many Turks in the Ruins. The same day the Duke of Loraine received other Letters from Vienna, written by Staremberg, and Capliers giving an Account of the de∣caying State and Condition of the Town. To which Answers was made on the 20th, informing them, that the Auxiliary Troops were advancing towards Vienna; and that the next day, he would take a view of the Coutry, for ordering the March of the Army; that they should speedily be relieved, and in the mean time, that they should be of good Courage.
The 21st, very early in the Morning the Turks ply'd all their Cannon very hotly up∣on the Town,Other Mines Sprung. and about eight a Clock, they set Fire to a a Mine under the Lobel Ba∣stion, but with little effect; and in the Even∣ing about six a Clock they Sprang another with like Success. 22th.The next day the Defendants to make an agreeable return to the Turks for their kind∣ness the day before, Sprang a Mine under the Ruins of the Ravelin; which threw so much Earth into the Traverses of the Ene∣my, as buried many of their Labourers and others, who being sunk up to the very Shoulders in Earth, were drawn out by their Companions: All the remainder of the day was spent in Fighting, the Turks labouring to gain the Ravelin, and the Chri∣stians to defend it. Towards the Evening, the Besieged threw divers Earthen Pots filled with Pitch, and Sulfur into the Ditches of the Court-Bastion, and of the Lobel, to burn the Enemies Traverses; the Flame of which could not be extinguish'd, until the Matter was totally consumed, and in the mean time it served the Christians for a Light, to see the Enemy when they ap∣proached near the Palisadoes. Whilst the Relief of Vienna was delay'd, the Imperial Troops not to remain Idle and without any Action, Colonel Huseler with Two thousand Horse, and Schultz with as many more,A Party of the Turks defeated. with several other Troops under other Captains, fell upon some Auxiliaries coming to Reinforce the Camp before Vi∣enna, and defeated them, and likewise a Party of Turks endeavouring to pass the Danube were repulsed. At length Three thousand five hundred of them having Ferried over the River in Boats, were attacked by the Impe∣rialists, and beaten back with the loss of Eight hundred and seventy Men; and many of them endeavouring to save themselves escaped in Boats, but others trusting to the Waters, and to Swim over, were drown'd, to the number as is supposed of Fourteen hundred Men, amongst which were two Pashas, and the Son of the Tartar Han was there wounded. Next Morning were brought in unto the Generals divers Colours and Standards, with Turkish Drums and Tim∣brels, and many Prisoners of Quality and Note. The Grand Vizier having received this News, Ordered Tekeli to repair im∣mediately to the Siege of Vienna with all his Forces: But Tekeli having received In∣formation of the great Army which was almost in a readiness to March to the Re∣lief of that place;Tekeli re∣fuses to come to the Turkish Camp. and fearing lest upon ill Success, the Vizier should Reak part of his Revenge upon him, he excused himself by pretence of the great urgency of Af∣fairs which required the utmost of his Force, and attendance in the Upper Hun∣gary. The Turks this day having carried on their Galleries to the very Foot of the Ra∣velin, Assailed it with all their Fury,23d. and after a long Fight they possessed themselves of a third part of it, and lodged therein: But the Christians who were Intrenched and For∣tifyed behind the Breach, kept still Possessi∣on of the other two thirds of that Work. It being observed from the Town, that the Turks were very busy in removing Earth, the Christians feared, as it was their com∣mon Discourse, that the Enemy was making their way Under-ground into the Cellars of the Emperor's Palace: And thô the Govern∣our gave not much Credence to this Report, yet he Ordered the Yeomen of the Guard, who were armed with Halberts, and left behind for preservation of the Court, to set their Centinels in the Cellars, and to re∣lieve them from time to time; and to be very Vigilant, and Attentive to hearken to the noise of Workmen, labouring under Ground. The same day one Kimpler a very ingenious Ingenier, working at a Counter-Mine under the Gate of the Castle, chan∣ced to open his Way into a large Vault en∣compassed with Walls; and therein he found a round Box of Tin, which he at first took for some Urn, or Coffin of a Dead Body;A Treasure found. but having open'd it, he was surprized with a Treasure of Gold and Silver, and search∣ing farther into it, he found a Parchment at the bottom with these words, written in Old Characters. Gaudebis Si inveneris, Videbis, Jacebis, Sed Orabis, Pugnabis, Adificabis. Non Hodie Nec Cras, sed Quia. Universus Equus. Turris Erecta & Armata. Diversa Ordinata Arma. Subscribed Rolland. Hung. Mog. posuit. Or, Rowland Hunn an Inhabitant, or Citi∣zen of Mentz, who was the Person that had deposited it in that place. Some are of Opinion, That this Rowland had buried this Case or Box, with a certain Spirit of Divination, as if he had Prognosticated that this Treasure should be found during the Siege of Vienna: And as if this Rowland Hunn should say to Kimpler, if it prove thy fortune to find this Treasure, thou shalt re∣joyce, behold it and say nothing; but give Thanks and Pray to Almighty God, and Fight. Thou shalt Build, but not to Day,
nor to Morrow, but hereafter; thou shalt Erect Churches, when thy Country is freed from it's Enemies, but not now while the Ottoman Horse encompass you, and that the Towers are Armed, and a Formidable force Besiege you. This was the Interpretation, which some passed on this Writing. 24th.The 24th, the Turks Sprang another Mine, but with little effect, more than the casting up of great quantities of Earth: But that which administred the highest Comfort, and Joy imaginable to the Defendants,The Besie∣ged com∣forted with hopes of Relief. was the entrance of a Messenger into the Town with the News of the great preparations making, and assurance that the Town would be relieved in eight hours time. The same day the Great Vizier detach'd a Party of Five hundred Horse to pass the Danube, to Spoil and Burn some Villages on the other side; but being encountred by Colonel Hei∣sler, they were defeated, and many of them in their Flight drowned in the River. 25th.The 25th, the Christians made a Sally with such Resolution and Fury, that they drove the Turks out of the Ditch, over∣threw their Galleries and Gabions, spiked six Pieces of their Cannon, and discharged one of their Mines of the Powder, which was ready to be fired, which a German Mi∣ner had luckily discovered in the Ditch. 26th.The 26th, the Turks fired two Mines under the Ruins of the Ravelin, with Re∣solution to make an Assault; but were still bravely repulsed by the Defendants, one Cannon shot having carried away sive Turks Heads at once. 27th.The Turks fired their Cannon and Mor∣tar-pieces with continued Peals for some hours; during which time in the Morning, Three hundred Musquetiers, and Fifty Horsemen of the Regiment of Dupigni, descended by certain Subterranean Vaults into the Ditch of the Court Bastion, where they ruined the Traverses of the Enemy in such manner, that they required three days time to be repaired; which was of highest concernment to the Defendants, to whom nothing was so necessary and impor∣tant, as to put the Enemy backwards in the Approaches, and Pressures they made upon them. In this Action one of the prin∣cipal Officers of the Turks was slain, as appeared by the Conflicts, that were made to regain his Body, for which there was a Dispute that lasted a whole hour; the same day the Turks fired two Mines, one on the left side of the Ravelin, and an other un∣der the Counterscarp which joyns to the Court Bastion; and immediately mounted on the Ruins, intending to possess them∣selves intirely of the Ravelin; but they were repulsed by Count Scaffemberg with great Slaughter. At the close of the Even∣ing, Forty Rock were fired om the top of St. Stephen s Steeple, to ge notice uo he Duke of Loraine of the great di∣stress of the City, and of the daily advan∣ces the Enemy made upon them, and the hourly diminution of the Garrison. The nex day to confirm these Signals,28th. the Duke of Loraine received Letters from Sta∣remberg and Capliers, representing the sad and extreme misery of the City, which could not hold out much longer, but must (if not speedily relieved) be yielded to the Besiegers: Howsoever, they concluded with a Resolution to defend themselves to the last drop of their Blood. The 29th, the Turks fired the greatest Mine of any they had yet done,29th. but to so little purpose, that they durst not adventure to second it by an Assault, as they had formerly done. This day about three a Clock in the Afternoon,30th. a Mine of the Turks over-threw a great part of the right Flanker of the first Retrenchment of the Ravelin, which was still defended by the Imperialists, thô the outward Retrenchment was possessed by the Turks. The Christians lost only two Men by this Mine, who were buried in the Earth; but the Turks pressing forward, were repulsed with loss of twenty of their Men who were killed. The Turks to conclude this Month, fired their Cannon and Mortars so incessantly,31th. that it was believed a General Storm would follow: And having fired a Mine in the Morning, they hoped to have become Ma∣sters of the Ravelin, now as it were at its last gasp, and Assaulted it with such Fury, that it seem'd ready to yield: But the Christians fought with so great Resolution, that they kill'd Sixty Janisaries upon the Ruins, and recover'd all the third, and part of the first Retrenchment. And thô the Defendants were well assur'd that they should be Relieved in very few days; yet not knowing what Acci∣dents might occur which none could fore∣see, they with all diligence made another Retrenchment at the Foot of the Court Ba∣stion, and at other places. Towards the Evening it was discovered, that the Tur∣kish Miners were at work under the Ra∣velin; in which to disturb them, it was agreed the next day to make a brisk Sally, and to burn the Galleries by which they passed to the Mine. The next Day being the first of the Month,Spet. 1st. the Sally was accordingly perform∣ed by three Hundred Men, who descending into the Ditch of the Court-Bastion, advan∣ced as far as to the Galleries, intending to burn and destroy them with Granadoes and diverse sorts of Fire-balls; but the Works being deep, and the Janisaries pressing on them in great numbers, the Defendants were
forced to retire with the loss of about twen∣ty Men, thô with many more on the Ene∣my's side. Towards the Evening, the Fight was again renewed by a fresh Assault of the Janisaries, purposing with full resolution to become entire Masters of the Ravelin; but the Christians being spirited with the hopes of speedy Succour, so valiantly opposed them, that at length they were forced to retire with great Slaughter: Immediately after which, the Besieged made another Sally with about four hundred and fifty Men, burnt their Galleries, and ruined those Works, which they could not repair again in less than three Days. In this Action the Citizens behaved themselves with much Bravey and Dexeti∣ty in the execution of their Fire-works; and thô this Sally cost them Ninety Men, yet it was attended with the death of above three Hundred Janisaries. The Day before was remarkable for the Encounter of the Duke of Loraine and the King of Poland; the first going to Olbrun to meet his Majesty:The Duke of Loraine meets with the King of Poland. So soon as they came in sight of each other, about the distance of twenty five Spaces, the Duke descended from his Horse, as did also the King; and coming near they embraced. The King in very affectionate Terms demanded after his Health, and commended his Valour and Conduct, by which he had sustained so long the force of such powerful Enemies. Then he presented to him his Son, Prince Alexan∣der, whom, he said, he had trained up be∣times in War, to serve the Emperor; and did not doubt but he would improve much more by the Guidance and Example of so great a General. To which the Duke re∣rurned answer, That his Majesty had not only amazed him with the heroick and ge∣nerous Act of so long and tedious a March, but had astonished him with the excess of his Favour and obliging Expressions towards him: That next to the Service of the Em∣peror, he desired to live, that he might per∣form something acceptable to his Majesty, and to all his Relations: That as to the Forms and Rules of War, no Person alive was so well versed in them as his Majesty, from whom all the Generals and Captains of the World might without discredit not be ashamed to learn the Lessons of Military Discipline: After which, the Generals of the Army, the Nobility and Vice-Chancel∣lor of that Kingdom, came and paid their Respects to the Duke of Loraine. And then, being mounted on Horse-back, the King having the Duke on the Right-hand, and the Prince on the Left;The order of their Supper. they enter'd into Discourse concerning the State of the War, and continued the same, until they came to the Camp, where, in the King's Tent, a sumptuous Supper was prepared at a long Table; the King sate in the middle; on his Right-hand the Duke was placed, and on his Left the Prince of Poland; after which the King ordered all the Nobility, who came with the Duke of Loraine to sit also. The Supper being ended, at which various Discourses passed, but most relating to the present Enterprise; the Duke of Lo∣raine returned to his own Camp, much sa∣tisfied with the Courtesie and Resolution of the King, who dispatched Messengers with all diligence to the General, who brought up the Rear, to hasten the March of the Army, with all convenient speed. And the next day the King dining with the Duke of Loraine at his Tent, resolved to meet the Emperor at Krembs on the second of Septem∣ber, where the Interview was appointed, and there it was where all things were to be concerted about the Passage over the Danube, and Conjunction of the Armies. Whilest these things were projecting, Count Sciamburg came from Nayburgh, bringing Advice, That the Elector of Saxony, with his Forces, could not be at Krembs until the third or fourth of this Month, upon which it was computed, that the Relief of Vienna could not possibly be until the 12th. Intelligence of all these Matters being carried to the Emperor, the Presence of his Imperial Majesty was judged necessary at Krembs, where the place of general Rendezvous was appointed, both to ani∣mate and inspirit the Army, and to accom∣modate, compose and silence such Quarrels and Punctilio's as might arise amongst so many Princes of different Countries, con∣cerning Place and Precedency; but the Emperor in his way thither, being taken ill of some Indisposition in his Health, pro∣ceeded no farther than Lintz, where he re∣mained until he received the happy News of the Relief of Vienna, and the Confusion of his Enemies. In the mean time, a general Council of War being held at Edendorf, at which the Elector of Saxony was present; the Duke of Loraine, by his Prudence, so ordered and disposed Matters, that no Questions about Place or Precedence came into competion.A meeting at Eden∣dorf. For so it was order'd, That at a long Table the King of Poland should sit in the middle, on his Right-hand the Elector of Saxony, and next to him all the Generals of the Em∣pire; and on the Left, the general Officers of Poland: Over-against the King, the Duke of Loraine took his Place, who was to be chief Speaker at that Assembly,A Council of War held there. in regard he was best able to render a true Account of the State of the War. The Council being sate in this form, it was laid down as a general Rule, That all Colonels, with the Concur∣rence of their General Officers, should give
in writing to the King of Poland a true State of their respective Regiments, and of the Places where they were Quartered; and that from his Majesty they should receive Rules and Instructions for their March to the Relief of Vienna. It was farther agreed, after some debate, That the Conjunction of the Army, with the Auxiliary Troops, should be on the 5th. of September in the Plains of Tuln: That the Army of Poland should pass the Danube at the same place with the Emperor's Army: That the Forces of Saxony should pass the River, by way of the Bridge at Krembs: And that all the Ba∣varian Forces which lay encamped with some German Troops, under the Command of Count Lesly, should March directly towards Tuln, to joyn with the Imperial and Polish Forces. The execution of these Designs was de∣ferred until the 7th. when the King towards the Evening began to pass the River, and was forthwith followed by the Duke of Lo∣raine at the Head of the Imperial Army; having first made a Detachment of three Regiments, which were to joyn with three Thousand Poles to cut off all Communication of the Turks and Malecontents, with the Vi∣zier's Camp. Colonel Heisler with his Regi∣ment of six Hundred Horse was ordered to take his March by the way of Clossen-neu∣burg, and to make Fires upon the Hills of Kalemberg, to give notice unto the Besieged of their approaching Relief, which was the Signal agreed between them. But before we come to this glorious Atchievement, let us see what was acting for Defence of the Town, and Difficulties to which the Besie∣ged were reduced. Sept. 2.In the Morning of this second day, the Point of the Court-Bastion was overthrown, which gave the Turks occasion to carry their Galleries farther, to the utter ruin of that Fort. Count Staremberg believing that the re∣maining part of the Bastion could not be longer defended, gave Order to Huiternian, a Captain of his Regiment, whose turn it was to mount the Guard that Night, to a∣bandon the Ravelin in case he found him∣self over-pressed by the Turks, and un∣der covert of the dark Night to make his Retreat. But this stout Captain having taken this Post with fifty Men, so bravely defended the remains of the tottering For∣tress, that thô the Turks burnt the Pali∣sadoes which were his chief Fortification, yet he repulsed them by the Fire of his Mu∣squets, with loss of twenty of his Men, and remained on the place until the Morn∣ing, having killed two Janisaries with his own Hands. 3d.Next day the Governour finding it im∣possible to maintain that Post any longer, gave order to the Guards to retire, and abandon it to the possession of the Turks, who had little more to boast of, than the ac∣quist of that Ravelin, after an Attempt of six Weeks continuance made thereupon. The fourth was a bloudy day,4th. both to the Christians and to the Turks; for the latter had sprung a Mine under the Court-Bulwark, which not only opened a Breach of seven Geometrical Paces, but shook the whole City with the violent concussion of the Air. Five thousand Turks,A bloudy Fight. immediately with Ce∣myters in their Hands, mounted the Breach, and sheltring themselves under some Sacks of Wool, which they carried before them, they mounted the Breach with their Cries, Allah, Allah, and planted four of their Stan∣dards thereupon. But not withstanding all this Fury of the Turks, they were repulsed with equal Bravery by the Christians. The Fight continued the whole day, in which the Ge∣nerals, Captains, and common Soldiers per∣formed the Offices and Parts of valiant and stout Defendants, who fearless of the Ene∣mies Cannon, small Shot, Bombs, Grana∣does and Mines, thô twenty of them were killed that day by one Bomb, and thirty by the Mine, yet still they remained resolute not to grant one Palm of Ground to the E∣nemy; but what they gained with the Lives of thousands. The Christians lost in this day's Conflict one Hundred fifty four common Soldiers, besides some Officers; but this Loss was recompensed with the slaughter of twelve Hundred Turks, whose Bodies filled up the Ditch, amongst which 'twas believed that diverse were Men of Quality, because their Corpse were carried off with much diligence and hazard by those, who attend∣ed them at their fall. The Turks, enraged with these Repulses,5th. fired their Batteries incessantly against the Walls of the Town; and towards the Even∣ing a terrible Fight began in the Ditch, at the foot of the Court-Bastion near the Breach, in which the Turks were beaten off with much Bravery by the Defendants, who not only repaired the Breach, but retrench∣ed themselves so strongly, that the Turks durst attempt them no more on that side. This day Arms were given into the Hands of four Hundred Inhabitants, who had not as yet been engaged on the Walls, having been employed in other Services. On the 6th. the Turks fired two Mines,6th▪ one of which was under the Lobel-Bastion, and being extreamly deep, it over-threw a great part of the Wall, opened a Breach of nine Paces wide,A Mine fired. and blew up twenty four of the Defendants. Howsoever, the Turks did not immediately proceed to an Assault, because the Mines had thrown up such vast quanti∣ties of Stones and Earth, as had almost fil∣led
up their Trenches, and buried many of their Soldiers. Howsoever, having breath∣ed and considered a while, they advanced to an Assault with their usual Multitudes, which continued for two Hours; till at length the Turks finding it impossible to pre∣vail, with-drew from the Breach, and fled with such fear, that not regarding the way they took to avoid the Enemies Shot, many of them came within reach of the Ravelin, called Molk; where they were so received by Cannon and Granadoes, filled with Nails and old Iron,Two thou∣sand Turks killed. and by small Shot from be∣hind a Redoubt placed in the Ditch, that whole Chambers of Janisaries were destroy∣ed in the Fight, and greater numbers killed than had been in any of the Assaults; the Loss having been computed at the least two Thousand Men. With this Success, and with the daily hopes and expectations of Relief, the Spirits of the Defendants were raised and exalted; as the Courages of the Enemy, with the many Slaughters sustained in the Siege, and apprehensions of the ap∣proach of a vast and formidable Army a∣gainst them began to abate and decline. And as a fore-runner of the expected Suc∣cour,Signals of the Suc∣cours com∣ing. five Rockets were discovered that Even∣ing in the Air, from the Mountain of Kalem∣berg, which was the Signal agreed upon in that case; and as a Token, that they were so understood by the Town, five Rockets more from the top of St. Stephen's Steeple were returned in answer. This day was the last that the Turks made their fiercest Attacks, being well assured, that what was not then obtained could not afterwards be effected, but by a total defeat of the Christian For∣ces; so that the Vizier did little more the day following being the 7th, than continue their Batteries without hope of much execution; and expecting every day to be Assaulted by an Army not much inferiour to his own, he drew out his Troops to take a review of them, and to see in what Condition they were to encounter so formidable an Enemy. The Army being drawn out, every Begler∣beg, Pasha or Sangiac gave in a List of the Men which remained under his Command; the numbers of which being cast up into one total Sum,Account of the Turk's Forces. amounted unto One hundred sixty and eight thousand Men; which prob∣ably might have been the full account of the whole Army, when they first surrounded the Walls of Vienna: Afterwards during the Siege, those which were slain or died by Sickness were computed at Forty eight thousand five hundred and forty four,What were killed at the Siege. as appeared by a List found in the Grand Vi∣zier's Tent after the Siege was raised; so that then the Turkish Army was reduced unto One hundred and nineteen thousand four hundred and fifty six fighting Men, besides Camel-drivers and Attendants on the Camp; and with this vast Force the Turks shame∣fully turned their Backs and Fled, as we shall shortly see in a few days follow∣ing. On the 8th,8th. there was an appearance of Smoak ascending from Mount Kalemberg, which gave an undoubted assurance to the Besieged, of the approach of some advan∣ced Troops designed for their Relief: And with this joyful Spectacle the Defendants beheld the Turks loading their Camels, and preparing to pack away with their Bag∣gage. Howsoever, they continued still to fire great quantities of Bombs, and Grana∣does into the Town, and to dig their Mines; one of which they fired this day under the Bastion of the Lobel: By which they blew up part of the Wall, which as believed would be seconded by a General Assault; and accordingly expected by the Defendants, who in fear thereof remain'd all day in Arms on their Guard, and with them the Regiment of Horse commanded by Dupigni, all serving on Foot, armed with their Helmets and Coats of Mail; but in∣stead hereof the Turks only made a small Attempt with about Three hundred Men, with which they had the fortune to beat the Christians out of the Trenches of the Pali∣sadoes, which united the Communication between the Lobel and Town: But Santa Croce, Lieutenant Colonel to Dupigni, with Fifty of his Regiment, armed as aforesaid, coming in to their assistance, repulsed the Turks from those Trenches, and again pos∣sessed themselves thereof: In which Action the Lieutenant Colonel was wounded in the Leg, as was also one of his Captains called Grove, and Sixteen of his Souldiers killed and wounded, besides Twenty five Foot Sol∣diers belonging to other Regiments; but still good fortune so favoured them, that they met with a Mine of the Enemy fur∣nished with Twenty eight Barrils of Pow∣der, which was ready to have been fired that Night, had they discharged it, and filled the vacancy again with Earth. The Turks having News of the near ap∣proach of Relief,9th. resolved to make their ultimate Effort on the Town, which they thought was now reduced to the last Gasp and Extremity, and that they must carry it now or never: Upon which accordingly they fired their Cannon, and Mortars double to what they had done on other days: But this was but like a lightning (as they say) before Death; for presently in the Af∣ternoon the Turkish Camp began to move, and their Cavalry to Ride from one side to another in a confused manner: Their Ser∣vants and Attendants were taking down their Tents, and loading their Camels with
their Baggage; all which was in order to the removal of their Camp, and pitching it in another place more commodious for Engagement, and Fighting with the Enemy. Howsoever, those who were left behind to secure the Trenches, and make good the Siege, still proceeded in their Subterranean Works, and this day fired nine several Mines under the Curtain, which was be∣tween the Court and Lobel Bastion, without much execution. 10th.On the 10th, a Discovery was made of three other Mines, which the Enemy had opened under the Curtain between the said Bastions; to defend which, all the Cannon on that side were brought to that place, and behind them so many Trenchments, Retrenchments and Palisadoes were made and erected, that it was almost impossible for the Enemy to advance ten Paces, with∣out meeting some difficult Pass, or Fortifi∣cation to overcome: And indeed the Turks had already found by good experience, that one span of Earth had cost them the lives of a Thousand Men to purchase it. Not∣withstanding which the place was reduced to its last extremity, and to a sensible want of all Provisions and Ammunition; and no∣thing could keep up their Courage and Re∣solution, but the hourly expectation of Relief, which they signified to the Duke of Loraine, by the continual firing of Rockets and other Fire-works; giving him thereby to understand that the Town was in it's last Agony, and the saving thereof, and of all their Lives depended only on some few Moments of time. 11th.On the 11th, the Turks plied their Can∣non and Mortar-pieces, as violent as at any time before, tho' the Fury of them con∣tinued not above three Hours; for the noise of the approach of the Christian Army be∣gan to silence the Roaring of Cannon, and turned their Thoughts from the offensive part, to a care of providing for their own security. In the Afternoon appeared three several Smoaks on the Mount of Kalemberg, which was the certain Signal of the approach∣ing Succour; at the sight of which, the Defendants full of Hopes and Courage, prepared to make a Sally on the Enemy: The People full of Joy run to the Ramparts which were least exposed to danger; the Women and others who were Feeble and Sickly left their Beds, and betook them∣selves to the Tops of Houses, to behold the pleasant Spectacle of their long desired de∣liverance; some of which were still despond∣ing with fear, and conceiving that the nu∣merous Troops of the Turks so Valiant, and so well Intrenched were almost invincible: Others presaged some wonderful Slaughter to insue; others of more sanguine and chear¦ful Temperament, beheld the Turks as lost, and figured unto themselves their shameful and ignominious Flight. In short, all Peo∣ple were full of Prayers and Vows to his Divine Majesty, that he would be pleased at length to Rescue, and deliver them from the many Dangers with which they were encompassed: Their Prayers were heard, and towards five a Clock in the Evening, some advanced Troops appeared on the Moun∣tain near the Monastery and Castle of St. Leopold, between whom and the Turks some Shot were exchanged; but Night coming on, the darkness put an end unto a far∣ther Engagement, which was reserved for the day following. This being the day appointed by Heaven for Relief of this expiring City,12th. which could not have held out twenty four Hours long∣er, the Imperial and Polish Army with the Auxiliaries joyned at the Foot of the Moun∣tain of Kalemberg, which before the Armies began to ascend, it was judged fit in the first place to take a Survey of the Ground, and the several Posts therein. The Marquis Parella, a Gentleman of illustrious Birth and clear Courage, represented the Ground in an exact Map to the Generals, and of∣fer'd with his own Person and Followers to possess himself of the Castle Leopold, and the Monastery, which were very advantagi∣ous Posts on this occasion. The Enterprise seemed so hazardous to the Duke of Loraine, that he commended the generous offer, which the Marquis had made, but judging it a more fit undertaking for Soldiers of less note, he drew out a Party of Sixty Grana∣diers under the command of a Lieutenant, to whom he committed this dangerous Service: The Duke having also in Person by night taken a more exact Survey of the place, and judging it to be of great impor∣tance, reinforced it with Three hundred Soldiers more; after which he returned back to the King of Poland, to inform him of the disposition of the Army. After which all the Forces were ranged in form of Bat∣tail, and began to March over the Moun∣tain of Kalemberg: The utmost part of the right Wing was committed to the Conduct of the King of Poland. The Numbers of the Christian Forces were as follow. Imperial Horse in Twelve Regiments con∣sisted of, 8200 Men Imperial Infantry in Forty two Companies, 6400 Dragoons of the same in Forty Companies, 2400
Cravats Nine hundred, Poles under Lubo∣miski, Fifteen hundred, 2400 In all 19000 Poles Twelve thousand Horse and Two thousand Foot, Commanded by himself in person, and under him by his Great General Jablonski, 14000 The Bavarians Commanded by Baron de Gonfeld, were Three thousand Horse, and Seven thousand five hundred Foot, in all 10500 Duke of Saxonies Forces Commanded by himself, were Two thousand Horse and Dragoons, and Seven thousand Foot 9000 Franconia, Commanded by Prince Valdeck, Horse Two thousand five hundred, and Foot Six thousand five hundred, 9000   61500 To which being added the several Princes, Volontiers with their several Attendants which followed them; this whole Army was computed to amount unto Sixty five thousand Men, which were now Marching to Engage the Turkish Army, which after after all their losses, had still remaining (as we said before) 119456 fighting Men; in this March over the Mountain of Ka∣lemberg,Order of the Chri∣stian Ar∣my. the Prince of Saxelawemburg Ge∣neral of the Cavalry, with eight Regi∣ments of Horse, two of Dragoons, and one of Cravats belonging to the Emperor, with all the Cavalry and Dragoons of Bavaria and Franconia, were placed on the Right Wing, next to which Marched the King of Poland with his Army. The Infantry of Bavaria and Franconia were drawn up in the third place or middle, Commanded by Prince Wal∣deck; near unto whom all that day was the Elector of Bavaria, who pretended to serve as a Volontier, it being his first expedition in the War. All the Emperor's Foot, and that of Saxony commanded by Prince Herman of Baden, were drawn up on the left Hand, and Marched directly along the Danube, and towards the Monastery of St. Leopold. Next to these on the left Wing marched Count Caprara with seven Regiments of the Emperor's Horse, to which the Poles, under Lubomiski were joyn'd, with all the Caval∣ry and Dragoons of Saxony, commanded by the Elector himself in Person. In this Or∣der the Army mounted the Hill, with a slow pace, to attend the Motion of the Ar∣tillery, which thô consisting of small Pieces; yet the Ways were so Rough and Rocky, that with double Teams of Horses, they ascended slowly to the Top of the Hill. And now both Armies with opening of the Morning began to take a view of each o∣ther:The Tur∣kish Camp opened. The Stars were not with drawn from the Sky, when the Christians heard the Alah, Alah sound from the Turkish Camp, which are the Lauds or Praises which they sing to God in their Prayers. The Fires and Lights in their Camp discover'd the excellent symetry, and order in the dis∣position of their Tents and Troops; which had been the most pleasing Spectacle in the World, had it not been of Enemies and In∣fidels, who came to destroy the Christian Religion, and the German Empire. From hence it was that the King of Poland, and the Duke of Loraine taking a view of the Enemies Forces, did conceive that the or∣ders in which they were placed, did look as if they intended to dispute every Foot of Ground between each Army; which they might have done with great advantage, in case they had possessed themselves of the Woods in the Forest of Vienna, and of Am∣buscades, which according to the nature of the Ground might be pleaced to hinder the descent from the Mountain. Wherefore the King desired of the Duke of Loraine Two thousand German Foot to Flank his Horse at the entrance out of the Wood, and to sup∣port them in the descent down the Craggy Hill, and accordingly four Batalions were granted for that service. Count Lesly, who was General of the Artillery, had received Orders to Raise a Battery at the coming out the Wood, for better security of the Army in their March over the Hill, which he almost effected with one nights work; but before he had quite finished it, the Turks made a discovery of what was there doing, and were put in mind thereby of what they themselves should have done to impede the Enemies passage that way: But certain it is, they were so confident of their invincible strength, that they thought it too mean for them to take the advantage of Posts, or Situations against an Army, of which they conceived so low an Esteem: But finding themselves at last deceived in those imaginations and Coun∣cils, they detached early in the Morning some Forces to demolish the Work, which Troops came very near, and posted them∣selves behind certain Trees which were felled, and Planks, which served for Barrica∣does against the Shot of the Battery. The Duke of Loraine observing from the Monastery of St. Leopol, the motion of the Turks against the advanced Troops, Ordered several Batalions under Command of the Duke of Croy to support them, which coming seasonably to their Assistance caused the Imperialists to enlarge their Front in that Line, and gave them Resolution to
Attack the Enemy, who were drawn up behind certain Banks, and charged them with so much Gallantry, that they forced them to retire into their main Body.The Duke of Croy wounded. In this Action the Duke of Croy being wound∣ed in the Shoulder by a Musquet Shot, was carried out of the Fight, and his place of Command supplied by the Count of Fountaine. The whole Body of the Turkish Army beginning now to move, the Duke of Lo∣raine gave Orders to his left Wing to ad∣vance, and to Prince Waldeck, and to Duke Saxelawemberg to Sally out of the Woods, and fall upon the Enemies Front at the Head of their Encampment. In the mean time the King of Poland was advanced as far as to the Chappel of St. Leopold, where he heard Mass with great Devotion, which was celebrated by Father Mark Aviano, a Capuchin and Confessor to the King, which being finished, the Blessing was given to him and all his Army: And then the King Cry'd with a loud Voice, Now we may March with entire assurance that God will give us Victory; And then mounting on Horse-back, he Road in amongst the Ranks of his Army, and made this Speech to them as follows. Generous Polish Cavaliers: 'Tis not only the Work of this Day to maintain the Glory which your Ancestours have acquired, and your own Courage hath Atchieved by passing to the Succour of the Invincible Bulwark of Christendom against the Ottoman Troops: Nor is it our Aim only to Defend our own Country, which in case Vienna were lost, would lie miserably exposed to the Invasion of those Enemies against whom we Fight at present. But our chief design is, to defend the Cause of God, and save the Western Empire which hath done us the Honour to have recourse unto our Arms; an Honour which our Ancestors never durst to hope for, and which is reser∣ved, as a Reward of your Valour: Whefore resolve to Conquer, or to Dye nobly in this Cause, in which Martyrdom is held out for the Prize and Recompense. Behold there∣fore your King, who Fights at the Head of your Battalions: And be confident that the God of Hosts, whose Cause we are going to maintain, will Fight on our side. The Mountain of Kalemberg, and the Woods of the Forest of Vienna resounded by this time with the Ecchoes from the Peals of Cannon, and Vollies of small Shot, which called the Inhabitants of Vienna to the Tops of their Houses, and of the Ram∣pires to behold the long wished for Sight of their approaching deliverance: How∣soever they were not so much taken up in seeing, and admiring, as to neglect their Guards and Watches on their fortifications; but on the Contrary, they plied all their Cannon, Small shot and Granadoes, against the Enemy in their Trenches,The Turke play with their Can∣non on the Town. with much profuseness, knowing that the time of their deliverance being come, they might the more lavishly bestow their Ammunition on their Enemies: The like quantities of Cannon, Fire-works, Bombs, &c. were returned from the Turks on the Town, and in greater a∣bundance than had been at any time since the beginning of the Siege; and all the Mountains, Plains and Places round the City were filled Fire, Smoak and Noise: In the mean time the King of Poland con∣tinued his March down the Hills, as did the Regiments of Dragoons of Heisler and of Saxony, which were posted on the left Wing, near the Chappel of St. Leopold: The like Orders were given to all the Imperial Army to advance towards the Enemy, who be∣gan now to shelter themselves under Rocks, and behind Trees, and in rough places: The right Wing also moved at the same time, and all with equal paces.The Turks give ground. The Turks made some resistance as yet, but so faintly as was not able to withstand the Fury of the Christians; and the several Shelters un∣to which they began to have recourse, showed plainly their intentions to quit the Field. The Devotions which the King of Poland used this Morning, retarded his March for the space of a full hour, during which the whole Christian Army made a Halt near to Neudorf, until the Poles were come up into the Line equal to the rest of the For∣ces. The left Wing of the Imperialists without much resistance, possessed them∣selves of the Post which the Turks possessed at Holstadt, and the Prince Waldeck caused the Enemy on the other side to give way. The appearance of the Poles on the Top and on the side of the Hill, looked very formidable to the Turks. The King, who marched at the Head of his Army, detach∣ed several Troops of his Hussars to Skir∣mish with the Front of the Enemy; but be∣ing over-powred, were forced to Retire to a place where Prince Waldeck had very sea∣sonably caused some Batalions of Bavaria, and of the Regiment of Merci to advance, which gave a stop to the pursuit which the Turks made after them.The Poles charge the Turks. The King upon this disorder of the Hussars caused the first Line of his Army to advance, which charged the Turks with so much Fury, as caused the Gross of their Body to Retire unto the Top of a Hill, where some of their Foot were drawn up, and several Batteries of Can∣non planted. And now all the Polish Army moved, the Enemy opposing them in di∣vers scatter'd places, from whence they fired Vollies of Musquets, with much dam∣age to the Poles; but as yet they were
not broken, but still advancing gained Ground on the Enemy. In the mean time the Duke of Loraine being far advanced with the left Wing to∣wards the Enemy; the Turks to avoid the Effort which was making on their Right, drew themselves into Batalia before their Line of Circumvallation, and fortified them∣selves with some Pieces of Cannon, as if they intended to have made a strong resi∣stence; but their Resolution continued not long before they gave way, and abandoning that Post, opened a way to the Christians into their Camp, without any opposition. Then it was, that the Duke of Loraine com∣manded all the left Wing to Wheel about unto the Right, taking in the whole com∣pass of the Turkish Camp, without break∣ing their Ranks, or falling upon the Plun∣der of the Enemies Baggage, or Tents which they had left Standing. The King of Po∣land,The King of Poland enters the Turkish Camp. and Prince Waldeck with their several Troops, enter'd the Turkish Camp about seven a Clock in the Evening: And the Duke of Loraine about half an hour after made himself Master of the Counterscarp, and Suburbs of the City; the Janisaries who were lodged in those Quarters escaping by favour of the Night, with much less Slaughter than if it had been Day; and in∣deed they behaved themselves with much more Valour, than others of the Turkish Militia: The Darkness put an end to the Battail, in which the Christians had gained a compleat and an undoubted Victory. And now the Duke of Loraine had leisure to send to complement the King upon this fortunate Success, a great part of which Glory, he attributed to the Valour and good Conduct of his Majesty and his gener∣ous Cavaliers: The King returned an An∣swer on the other side, with like obliging expressions, confessing, that thô every Na∣tion and Battalion in the Army did their parts; yet much of the Honour of the Success of this Day, was due to the Bra∣very of the Germans, who were the first to enter into the Camp and Trenches of the Enemy. Thus were the Christians become Masters of the Turkish Camp, where they lodged that Night in the same Form and Order, as the Turks had done the Night before, with Fires and Lights in all the Tents; only it was a more grateful Spectacle to the Be∣sieged, which they could behold with more Comfort and Security, than ever they had done the Nights before; for this was of Joy, and the others of Terrour. In the Night the Turks passed the River at Sweker,The hasty Flight of the Turks. with so much Fear and Precipi∣tation, that they not only left their whole Camp standing, but even the Standard of the Empire, which is the Sacred Banner of their Religion, with the three Horse Tails, which are the Ensigns of the Vizier's Au∣thority. Moreover, they abandoned to their Enemies all their Tents, Baggage, Am∣munition and Provisions, with all their Can∣non and Artillery, being One hundred and eighty Pieces; and so speedy were they in their Flight, that before the next Day in the Evening, the Van of their Army had passed Raab. Next day early in the Morning Count Staremberg attended with his Son, and se∣veral of the principal Commanders of the City, went out to return Thanks to his Benefactors for so great deliverance, and to Congratulate with them their Fortunate Successes and Triumph, which would ap∣pear Glorious over all the World: But the first thing which the Duke of Loraine did that Morning by break of Day, was to Or∣der all his Army to put themselves into a readiness to March, whilst he consulted with the King of Poland, how, and in what man∣ner they might pursue the Enemy, and im∣prove the Victory. But the King seemed so well satisfied with the advantage already gained, and with the Prey and Booty of which he was possessed,The Vizi∣er's Tents fall to the lt of the King of Poland. sitting Master in the Vizier's Tent, with all the Appurtenan∣ces and Accommodations thereunto belong∣ing, that he excused all farther Proceedings at present; saying, That his Army was much Harassed, and required Repose, and not in a Condition to pursue an Enemy, whom they beheld at a far distance advan∣ced in their way before them, by the Fires and Smoak whith ascended upwards; for as the Turks fled they burnt all the Villages through which they passed. And now in the Christian Camp, and in the City was time for Joy and Triumph. Count Staremberg having paid his Respects, and made his Complements to the King of Poland, and the Duke of Loraine, he conducted them into the City, with a numerous attendance of Nobility and Gentry, who had served in the late Siege; all the Forces were drawn up on both sides of the Streets, between which they passed with loud Acclamations of Joy, unto the Church of the Augustin Fryers, where in the first place, as was most just, Te Deum was Sung, and Thanks returned to God with Sincere Devotion: Thence they went to the House of the Go∣vernour Count Staremberg, where he recei∣ved the Applause and Praises of the King of Poland, and the Duke of Loraine, which were due to his Conduct and Valour; and the like Commendations were bestowed by them upon all the Officers and Souldiers of the Garrison, who had every one signalized themselves during this Siege, by some
Action, or piece of Service or other which was Remarkable and worthy of Observation: Afterwards these welcome and long-desired Guests were entertained with a sumptuous Feast at the Governour's House;The Jo at Vienna. after which, towards the Evening, with the like Joy and Festivity they returned to their respective Quarters and Tents in the Camp. In the mean time, the Besieged Inhabitants, who had long been pent up and inclosed within the Walls of the City, were not only desi∣rous to breath in a more open Air, but were carried with a Curiosity to see the Ap∣proaches, which the Enemy had been ma∣king on them, and how near they had en∣tred to the Heart of the City, that it may be doubtful, whether it was more pleasant to Men, lately delivered from the extremi∣ty of a perishing Condition, to behold how near they were to the devouring Enemy, and yet to escape; or to survey, with an amazed Curiosity, the Tents, Batteries, Trenches and Approaches, which the Turks had formed against them with wonderful Art and Industry. The Face of all things was now changed, Want and Famine into Plenty, Fears and Anguish into Joy, and War into Peace: In the Vizier's Tent,The Vizier's Tent allot∣ted to the King of Po∣land. of which the King of Poland was possessed, the rich Vestments, Jewels, and Mony there found, were valued at a Million, and became the Prey and Boo∣ty allotted to his Majesty, which no Man envied considering the generous and heroick Action of that Prince, for whose Merit no Reward seemed too great: Amongst other things in that Tent the Standard of Maho∣met was found, which the King sent to Pope Innocent the XI. by his Secretary Tulenti. On the 14th. the Emperor, with the E∣lectors of Bavaria and Saxony, entred in∣to the City of Vienna,The Empe∣ror's En∣trance into Vienna. which he beheld with Eyes of Compassion and Tenderness; for seeing the Desolation, which the Enemy had made, and considering the Slaughter of many of his trusty Citizens and valiant Sol∣diers, he could not refrain from Tears of Sorrow, mixed with Joy for the Deliverance and Safety of the superviving Party. Being entred within the Gates, he went directly to the Cathedral of St. Stephen's, not on Horse-back, or on a Triumphal Chariot, but humbly and meekly on Foot, carrying a Taper in his Hand, in a kind of peniten∣tial manner, went to the great Altar to pay his Duty, and offer up his solemn Thanks to Almighty God, according to his usual Devotion, for the wonderful and miraculous Deliverance of that City. And having thus in the first place complied with his Service towards God, he went in the next to visit the King of Poland, whom he overtook at Sweket, a Village about a League distant from Vienna, as he was proceeding on some farther Enterprise against the Enemy: Up∣on notice of the Emperor's Approach, the King, whose Army marched in the Van,Interview between the Emperor and King of Poland. made a stop; and the German Army being in the Rear, the Emperor placed himself at the head of them; and the Polish Army facing at the same time about, the King appeared at the head of his; and so between the two Armies these two great Princes, at∣tended with a numerous Train of the chief Nobility and Gentry belonging to each Court, met and embraced each other, and with very affectionate Complements, and Expressions of Kindness and Friendship; ha∣ving entertained Discourse together for the space of near half an Hour, after second Embraces, they departed. Never was there a more heroick and generous Action per∣formed in the World, than was this of the King of Poland, who, after a long and tedi∣ous March, so valiantly exposed his own Person to Hazard, and his Army in the face of an Enemy, which to human Appearance was Invincible; and all this to bring Relief and Succour to an Ally, and to maintain the Bulwark of Christendom against Infidels, and Enemies to the Christian Cause; 'tis such a piece of Bravery as cannot be parallelled with all its Circumstances in any History of past Ages; and therefore with much Reason and Justice were his Praises celebrated over all the Christian World; and the Poets, and other refined Wits in diverse Countries, and diffe∣rent Languages, exercised their Pens in Pa∣negyricks and Elogies, striving to out-vy and surpass each other in the Excesses of Praise, which how Hyperbolical soever could never reach to the imputation of Flattery. We shall repeat one, which was composed at Rome by Guicciardin Procur.

Which Noble and Heroick Action would have remained on the Records of History to all Posterity in honour of this King, had he not afterwards sullied and tarnished the Glory thereof, by condescending and stoop∣ing to Actions as low, and mean, as this was Sublime, and only worthy of the Dig∣nity of a Heroe, as we shall show in the following Year. But to return again from whence we have digressed; the Emperor and King having passed their Complements, Prince Alexander, Son of the King, whom his Father presen∣ted with the Complement of having Enlist∣ed himself early into the Service of his Im∣perial Majesty. The young Prince, by or∣der of his Father, had habited himself in the German Fashion, and was admitted to Kiss the Emperor's Hand, as were all the Persons of Quality belonging to the Army, and Court of Poland. The King after having viewed the Riches taken in the Vizier's Tent, which he assum∣ed to himself as the Reward of his own At∣chievements: Out of Complement, he sent to the Emperor to make tender of one half of the Booty, accompanying the Message with the Tugh, or Horse-tayl on a Staff, with a brass Knob on the top, which was one of the three Staves of Authority carried before the Vizier: Such another kind of Present like this, being Mahomet's Standard, he sent to the Pope; which being Gifts of no great Value, more than for the Curiosity of them, he frankly and really offered; but as to half the Prey, it was generally believed, that his Majesty was well informed before∣hand, that the Emperor was of too generous a Nature to accept thereof; and would not have been so prodigal of his Offers, had he imgined he should have been taken at his word. But it is not here to be forgotten, that after the Bishop of Newdorf had sung Te Deum before the Emperor, and performed the other Ceremonies, which lasted for the space of four Hours; at the Conclusion of all, when the Emperor was come out of the Church, the Arch-Bishop of Vienna turned him about, and pointed to the Spire of the Cathedral Steeple: Behold, Sir, said he, that Spar which issues from the Spire, at the end of which is a Star within the Crescent or Half-moon; and consider that that Monu∣ment was there fixed in the Year 1529, when Soliman Besieged the City, and was so to remain by Compact with the Citizens, conditionally,The Cross erected in place of the Half-moon. That the Turks should not batter the Steeple with their Cannon: And now whereas that Article was broken, by the continual Shootings, which the Enemy had made against it at the last Siege, it is but reason that the Crescent should be ta∣ken down; and in Memory of the present Deliverance, that a Cross should be erected in the place thereof; for which the Emperor having given present Orders, they were ac∣cordingly executed. On the 10th. the Duke of Saxony return∣ed home with his Troops,The Duke of Saxony returns home. which speedy departure so soon after the raising of the Siege, (which seemed too short a time for Refreshment of his Soldiery) was interpre∣ted for a Sign of Discontent, perhaps to see the Poles Rewarded with the greatest Spoils, and the Auxiliaries neglected, as if they had no Share or Merit in the Victory. The Emperor finding his Palace much ruined and unfurnished at Vienna, staid but few days there before he returned to Lintz, where he intended to remain until the Repairs of Court and City were made, and the Walls and Trenches cleared of the dead Bodies, which rendred the Air Unhealthful and In∣fectious: During the time of his stay at Vienna, he took delight to visit the Re∣trenchments and Fortifications, which the Defendants had made behind the Walls and Bastions, to dispute every Foot and Inch of Ground, as occasion had required: He also surveyed the Batteries, Trenches and Ap∣proaches of the Enemy, and saw the Stores of Ammunition and Provisions which they had left behind them, which served again to recruit and replenish the Arsenal at Vienna. The List and Account whereof was as fol∣loweth: Six Thousand five Hundred Tents, four Thousand five Hundred Barrels of Pow∣der, six Thousand weight of Lead, 20.000 Granado Shells, eight Thousand Hand-gra∣nadoes, 11.000 Shovels and Pickaxes, one Thousand six Hundred weight of Match, two Thousand five Hundred Fire-balls, 52 Hun∣dred weight of Pitch, eleven Hundred weight of Oyl of Petolium and of Tar, and five Hun∣dred
Thousand of Lincet-oyl, Ninety five Hundred of Salt-peter, five Thousand one Hundred ieces of coarse Linnen, two Hun∣dred Thousand Hair Sacks for carrying Earth and Sand, eighty one Hundred weight of Barrs of Iron and Horse-shooes, an Hundred Ladles for melting Pitch, two Hundred weight of Pack-thread, and Thongs made of Camels Hides, and Buffoloes Leather for binding, four Thousand Sheep-skins, two Thousand Hal∣berts, four Hundred Scythes and Scycles, five Hundred and sixty Barrels of Guns for use of the Janisaries, Fifty two Sacks of Cotton and Cotton-yarn, one Thousand five Hundred Wool-sacks empty, two Thousand Plates of Iron for covering Targets, an Hundred and twenty three Hundred weight of Greese and Tallow, two Hundred thirty Powder-horns, two Thousand six Hundred Baggs for Pow∣der, four pair of Smith's Bellows for a Forge, twenty one Instruments, or Engines for rai∣sing Carts when overturned, eight Thousand Carts for carrying Ammunition and Provi∣sions, all empty, one Thousand great Bombs, eighteen Thousand Cannon-bullets, great and small, an Hundred and ten Pieces of Cannon of all sorts, as Culverin, Demycul∣verin, demy and whole Cannon, Sakers, &c. thirteen Mortar-pieces, mounted for shoot∣ing Bombs, six great Anvils, diverse Sacks for use of the Ordnance, and many Ladders made of Cords. All which, as we have said, were carried into Vienna, and laid up amongst the Stores of that Arsenal. After this Work was done, the next was to employ all the Labourers belonging to the City, with the captivated Turks, whom they made to assist in filling up the Trenches, Holes and Vaults which the Turks had made; some of which were so deep, that they seemed rather to be Caves and Dens than Trenches for covert and shelter for Besieg∣ers: So that had not the Turks busied them∣selves in such fruitless Labours, they might have compassed that in half the time, which was not effected in the space of sixty two Days. Amongst these other Works, several Vaults were found filled with dead Bodies, putrified and stinking, and all the Country round for many Leagues were strowed with dead Carcasses; for Burying of which, or Burning, or casting into the Danube, strict Orders were given, and which with much diligence were executed, to prevent a Pesti∣lence, the Putrefaction of which began al∣ready to infect the Air. Amongst the dead, the Bodies of many Women and Children were found, who had been made Slaves and Captives by the Turks, and Massacred by them, either out of Revenge, or because they were an Incumbrance to them in their Flight; but to these Bodies some Respect was shown, being carried to Cimeteries, and there interred after the Rites of the Christi∣an Burial, with Crosses erected over their Graves. Howsoever some Turks, who were Men of more tender Bowels than the others (for we must not figure them all to be of the like fierce and cruel Disposition) did quit the Possession of their Slaves with more gen∣tleness, and set them at liberty with their Lives, of which most were Women and Children, the which the Germans and Poles took up and brought them back again to Vienna. By this time, that the Trenches were fil∣led without the City, and the Walls and some Houses repaired, the News of the happy Deliverance of Vienna had spread it self over all the Countries, from whence Provisions of all sorts came, and Boats la∣den with Corn, Wine, Fruits and Herbs ar∣rived daily in, to supply the Wants of the City; the Face of which was totally chang∣ed, from Famine to Plenty, from War to Peace, and from Terror and dismal Appre∣hensions to Joy, Triumph and Festivals. The Spirits of the Imperialists and Poles be∣ing highly raised by these Successes, some Par∣ties pursued the Turks, who were as much de∣jected as the others were elevated; and thô they hastened in a precipitous Flight, appre∣hending an Enemy just at their backs; yet many of them in the Arrear, appointed to conduct twelve Pieces of Cannon, and some Baggage were over-taken in the Pursuit, and brought back to Vienna, where these Captives, with their other Brethren, were ordered to work in Chains for filling the Trenches, which they had before opened, and repair of the Walls and Bastions, which they had battered down with their Cannon, and blown up with their Mines. The Grand Vizier hastning his March, or rather his Flight, for (as we said before) he actually Ran away and shamefully turned his Back with near 120.000 Fighting Men; meditating (as we may believe) of the Dis∣grace,The Grand Vizier com∣plaining to the Grand Seignior a∣gainst the Pasha of Buda. Ruin and evil consequences of this Misfortune, sought and endeavoured to clear his ill Conduct, and want of Courage by casting it upon others, as is common to the Nature of Mankind. Accordingly he dispatched away a Letter to the Grand Seignior, giving him an account of the un∣fortunate Success before Vienna, caused by the Cowardise, or Treachery of several great Officers and Generals of his Army: Parti∣cularly he named the Vizier of Buda, to whom having given command to Charge the Enemy with a Body of Twelve thousand Men, as they descended the Hill of Ka∣lemberg; he, and his Soldiers instead of obeying these Orders, shamefully turned their Backs and put themselves unto Flight; which when the rest of the Army saw, they
were struck with a common Consternation and Fear, suggested to them to secure their safety by following the Example of their Fellow-Soldiers: So the whole misfortune of the Day was attributed to the ill Conduct, and Cowardise of the Vizier of Buda, which was sent to the Grand Seignior, then residing at Belgrade, and in hourly expectation of better News. The Vizier of Buda, who had received Information by several Hands of the Dis∣courses with which the Grand Vizier enter∣tained all the Officers concerning him, lay∣ing to his Charge the Loss and Ruin which had happened; thought fit to disculpate, and clear himself by a more faithful Rela∣tion of Matters in a Letter to the Grand Seignior;The Vizer of Buda writes to the Grand Seignior. wherein he set forth, That by the unskilfullness of the Grand Vizier, and his want of Resolution in Military Affairs, this important matter had miscarried: For had he fortify'd the Forest of Vienna, and ere∣cted some few Redoubts on the descent of the Hill of Kalemberg, the City by all the Force of the World, could never have been Relieved: Or had the Vizier spent that time, which he employ'd in sinking Vaults and Caves for shelter, in bold Storms and Attempts, thô with loss of half the Army, the importance of the place, and the con∣sequences of the Success, would have large∣ly paid for the effusion of Blood; but using unnecessary cautions of Mines, and formal Approaches, by which he hoped to have constrained the City to Surrender upon Ar∣ticles, and hereby assumed to himself the Riches and Plunder of the place, which taken in Heat of Blood, and by Dint of Sword, would have become the Prey and Booty of the Soldiery; he gave occasion to such delays, as served the Christian Army, and turned to the Ruin and Miscar∣riage of this whole Enterprise. The Grand Vizier Strangles the Vizier of Buda and other Pashas.The Grand Vizier being weary of such Complaints as these, resolved to Sacrifice the Life of the Pasha of Buda to his own Folly and Destiny; commanding him to be Strangled, together with the Pashas of Es∣sek and Possega, and the Aga of the Janisa∣ries, great Friends and Confidents of the Vizier of Buda, and the best and most experienced Officers of the whole Army, with above Fifty Officers and Soldiers more, whom he accused of Cowardise; but this Execution of Justice (as they call it) could not secure his own Life, but rather furnished his Enemies at Court, such as the Kuzlir Aga and others, with instances where∣with to aggravate his Crimes to the Grand Seignior; and indeed there now offer'd a surprising occasion to wreak their Malice on the Vizier, since it is almost impossible, for a Man to be unfortunate and yet to be estemed Innocent. Nor did the Vizier es∣cape clear, with the remainder of his shat∣ter'd Army to Buda; for being Attacked in the Rear by the Garrison of Raab, he lost Six hundred Men more: Howsoever, he proceeded in his March, and Reinforced the Garrisons of Newhausel and Strigonium. The Death of these Pashas, by which the Vi∣zier hoped to have saved his own Life, raised such Mutiny amongst the Turks,Mutiny in the Turkish Army. as caused a greater Fluctuation of Rage in the Minds of the Soldiery, than they had lately endured of Fear from the Enemy; between which two Passions, there was nothing but Confusion, Discontent and Dis∣couragement in the whole Army: For the Pasha of Buda was popular, and well be∣loved by the Soldiery, and esteemed the most Martial Man in the whole Camp: And the Aga or General of the Janisaries was so well affected by that Militia, that they high∣ly resented his Death; for at no time, (much less in this) can they endure to have their General punished or cut off, un∣less it be by themselves, and in their own Mutinies. In this confusion were the Turks, when the Chief Captains of the Christian Army consider'd,A Council of War. that the present Relief of Vienna would be of little benefit to the Christian Empire, unless the Victory were pursued, and improved by succeeding Enterprises: All the Princes and Commanders agreed hereunto, (except the Elector of Saxony, who as we have said before return'd home) and wisely judged, that the Turks having made a Retreat with a Body of near 120.000 Men, entire and whole, they might reasonably be expected the next year to return again unto the Siege, unless advantage were taken of their present Con∣sternation, to break and confound them be∣yond a possibility of Recovery: At this Council, it was proposed to Besiege New∣hausel or Gran, and for enlargement of Winter-quarters, and Annoyance of Buda and Gran, that Pest and Barcan should be taken: In fine, after some debate it was concluded, That nothing could be resolved at present concerning the manner of Pro∣ceedings, for that the Actions of War, were to be regulated according to the Motions of the Enemy; but that something was to be undertaken speedily, whilst the Iron was hot, and the Spirits of the Turks cold, and still under their late Consternation: The King of Poland being of the same Mind, Commanded his Troops to advance to∣wards Presbourg, which on the 18th En∣camped near Ficken, together with the Imperial Forces, and came thither on the 19th where they were forced to con∣tinue until the 25th for want of a Bridge,
which could not be finished until that time. Tekeli sends a Letter to the King of Poland.Whilst the Bridge was framing, and the Army detained on the Banks of the River; a Messenger from Tekeli brought a Letter to the King of Poland, containing certain Proposals in order to an Accommodation. The King having received a Character of Tekeli to be a Man of Intrigue, and False, and who had frequently made Offers of Peace, but never obsered any; admitted his Messenger to Audience in a manner of Coldness and Jealousy, and yet with re∣spect due to the Person from whom he was sent: But before he would receive the Letter, he asked, Whether it was Dated before, or since the Raising of the Siege of Vienna: To which the Messenger making answer, That it was Wrote two days before that Success: The King thereupon Replied with an angry Frown, Go said he, and re∣turn the Letter to your Master again, and tell him, That he should correct and amend the Stile, and change the Substance and Sense thereof, according to the alteration of Times and Affairs. Such is the force of Success and Prospe∣rity of a Prince, that so soon as the News of the Relief of Vienna was divulged in the Upper Hungary, many Counties declared for the Emperor;Some Ci∣ties Re∣volt. and the Fortresses of Papa and Totis, were the first to give Examples of Obedience and Duty to other Cities. News also came at the same time, that the Count of Budiani, who upon the formida∣ble appearance of the Turks,Budiani changes his side. had deserted the Post he maintained on the Passage over the Raab, and had taken Party with the Malecontents, and joyned with a Body of Turks and Hungarians, and had Fought a∣gainst the Imperial Troops, and Burnt and Plunder'd several Villages on the Frontiers of Stiria; Had now with the turn of For∣tune, changed his side and interest; and having Surprised, and Cut in pieces those very Turks with whom he was Associated, had united his Forces with those of Count Aspremont, and therewith troubled and in∣fested the Turks in their Retreat. The Bridge over the Danube being fini∣shed, the Poles were the first to March over it into the Isle of Schultz; and were fol∣lowed by the Imperial Army: But the Troops of Bavaria and Franconia, remain'd still Encamped near Vienna, for want of Orders to advance farther; but Letters were sent to the Princes of that Circle, to continue the Aid of their Forces for some farther design; and a Messenger was dis∣patched to the Elector of Bavaria, who by Reason of some indispotion of Health, was advised by his Physitians to go to Brin, for benefit of the Air, which was esteemed more wholsom than that of Vienna. But the year being now far advanced to∣wards the end of September; to stay for such Orders, and the March of these Auxi∣liaries, the Season would be too far spent, to undertake any Action of great moment; wherefore the King of Poland, and the Duke of Loraine resolved to advance with their Army to Comorra without the Rein∣forcement of the Allies. Being come to a place called Wismar, within an hours March of Comorra, Advices were brought, that Tekeli had dispeeded a Detachment from his Camp before Levents to Bergstadt, that the Vizier was at Buda, from whence he had Reinforced the Garrison of Newhausel with Four thousand Men; but that in the Tur∣kish Army were such Discontents caused by the late ill Successes, and by the Cutting off of the Pasha of Buda, and other great Men well affected by the Soldiery, that there was nothing but Mutiny and Confu∣sion in the Camp. Upon this Intelligence, it was resolved at a Council of War to at∣tempt Gran,Resolved to Besiege Gran. and which to make the more Feasible, it was concluded necessary in the first place, to take the Fortress of Barcan, which is a Palanca opposite to that City, and covers the Foot of the Bridge over the Danube, which makes a Communication be∣tween the two places. By this time Four thousand Swedish Infantry and One thousand Horse, with some other Auxiliaries (which by reason of the distance of the places, from whence they came, could not Arrive in time to partake in the Honour of relie∣ving Vienna,) were all sent with what expe∣dition was possible down the Danube to Re∣inforce the Army, which was thereby be∣come more numerous and flourishing, than before the Fight at Vienna. The first to pass that Arm of the Danube, which is called the Waag, was the King of Poland with his Army; which was the work of the 4th and 5th of Octob. the Imperial Ca∣valry followed,The Chri∣stians pas the River. but the Foot could not pass the same day: The 6th they Marched to Mose, two Leagues distant from Comorra, where Count Staremberg had Orders to March the Foot; and on the 7th to joyn the Army, which would stay and attend them at that place. But the King of Po∣land impatient of delay, contrary to expe∣ctation immediately mounted on Horse∣back, and sent to advise the Duke of Lo∣raine that he was Marching towards Bar∣can.The Poles advance before the Imperi∣alists. The Duke being surprised at this sud∣dain Resolution, returned Count Dunewald to his Majesty, to represent unto him the necessity of taking the Foot with them, and the danger of dividing the Army, in a place so near to the Enemies Quarters, be∣ing between the Turks on the one side, and
the Malecontents on the other. But the King being already mounted on Horse-back, when Dunewaldt came to him, he an∣swered, That he knew no Reason which might cause him to defer his Proceedings, having certain Intelligence, that the Detachment of the Turks near Barcan was very inconsi∣derable, and desired that no time should be omitted in following with the rest of the Army. The Duke leaving only a Regi∣ment of Cravats to support the Infantry, Marched away with all the Horse to attend the Poles: The King being come within an hour's March of Barcan, understood from the advanced Troops of his Van-guard, that they were in sight of some Squadrons of the Enemy; which they having orders to Charge, the Turks gave ground, but be∣ing supported by a greater Body, the Van was forced to Retreat; to Succour and Sup∣port which, other Troops were commanded to Charge the Enemy; and at length, the King in Person with all his Cavalry was engaged. The Turks, who until now had concealed Seven or eight thousand Men un∣der covert of a Hill, began to appear, and Sallying forth,The Poles put to Flight. Charged the Poles both in the Front and Rear with such Bravery, as that they killed Two hundred of them, with the Palatine of Pomerania, and put the rest unto Flight, taking several of their Co∣lours, Kettle-drums and some Baggage. Count Dunewaldt, who had Marched with the King of Poland, observing the Skirmish of the first Troops, sent to advise the Duke of Loraine, that the Poles were Engaged with the Turks; upon which News he hast∣ned his March with all the diligence that was possible; and having passed certain narrow Ways and Bushes, he espied at the opening of the Plain, the Turks in hot pur∣suit of the Poles: At the sight whereof, he immediately took care to draw up his advanced Troops into Battalia, and gave order to Prince Lewis of Baden to do the like with those Marching in the Rear. The appearance of the German Regiments, which stood firm and entire before the face of the Turks, caused them to desist from their pursuit, and to return under Barcan. The Duke of Loraine thought not fit to follow them that Day, but rather to Rally and Fortify the Poles, and to enquire after the King, who was said to be lost; but at-length his Majesty appearing and found in safety, it alleviated something of the ill Success of that Day; which by that time that the Story was told, and Matters rela∣ted in what manner things had passed, it grew towards Night, when it was thought fit to Encamp until the Morning. All that Night there was great distur∣bance in the Polish Camp; the loss sustain'd by the Slaughter of so many of their Friends and Comrades, was such a Grief and Dis∣couargement to them, that they were desi∣rous that Night to yield the Quarter on the right Wing, which was nearest to Barcan, unto the Germans, who had formerly chal∣lenged that place as their due: And towards Morning the principal Officers insinuated unto the King the many Circumstances, which presented to render the Success diffi∣cult, alledging that their Army was Galled, and soar of their Wounds and much Dis∣couraged, and the Enemy flushed with Yesterday's Fortune, and more numerous than was believed.The King of Poland unwilling to adven∣ture ano∣ther En∣gagement. The news of this Discon∣tent and Wavering in the Polish Camp being brought to the Duke of Loraine, he im∣mediately went to the King to keep him steddy to the former Resolutions and Mea∣sures; and so well mannaged his Discourse with him, producing many Reasons why the Enemy could not be very strong, and arguing the Probability and almost Cer∣tainty of Victory; that in fine he prevailed upon the King, his Senators, and chief Of∣ficers to make Tryal of next Day's En∣gagement. The Duke of Loraine having taken a full Survey of the Ground, and of the Situation of Barcan, gave a description thereof uno the King; and offered the Ho∣nour of the right Wing unto the Poles, for which they had formerly contended; but being much taken off of their Mettle, they desired to change their Station, and mix some of their Troops with those of the Im∣perialists. An hour before Day the Duke of Loraine caused to sound to Horse, and with the dawning of the Morning the whole Imperial Army was drawn into Battalia, consisting of Horse and Foot, to the number of Sixteen thousand two hundred Men, besides the King of Poland's Army, and the Fifteen hundred Po∣landers under the Command of Lubomiski. Prince Lewis of Baden Commanded the right Wing, and under him Count de Gondola, and the Baron of Mercy. Count Dunewaldt Com∣manded the left, and under him the Counts of Palsi and Taaff;The Orders of the Chri∣stian Ar∣my. and the main Body of In∣fantry was conducted by Count Staremberg, the Duke of Croy and Count Serini. The Poles being expected in their Station, seem∣ed still tardy and backward to draw out, by Reason that the King had in the Night received Intelligence, that the Enemy was greatly recruited by a strong Body, Com∣manded by Hasly Pasha of Aleppo, and the Pashas of Silistria and Grand Cairo; and that it was much to be doubted,The Poles deliberate again a∣bout fight∣ing. whether the whole Turkish Army were not joyned with them. But the Duke of Loraine op∣posing unto these Doubts undeniable Rea∣sons,
why it was not possible for the Gross of the Turkish Army to be joyned with these Forces before Barcan; and yet on sup∣position, that they were yet considering the advantagious Ground on which the Army was drawn up, they needed not fear the whole Ottoman Force; of all which he made such clear Demonstrations, that the King was again confirmed in his former Re∣solutions, and so with a Party of his Hus∣sars, and of his Infantry, and of the Flow∣er of his Cavalry, he posted himself on the right Wing, between the Imperial Cavalry and the Dragoons: And the great General Jabloniski, with some of the Hussars Foot and Cavalry marching on the left Wing, be∣tween the German Horse and Dragoons, and the rest of the Polish Army made a third Line. In this order they marched about half an hour, when about nine a Clock they discover'd the Enemy drawn up in Battalia upon the Plain, marching very slowly, and in such manner, as that their Force seemed equal to that of the Christians: The Armies being come very near, the Turks of the right Wing charged the left of the Christians with much fierceness, as if they had had a particular spight, and aimed chiefly at the Poles:The Fight begun. And at the same time, the Turks who were on the rising of a Hill advanced, as if they intended to Charge the main Body of the Christians. But being within half Musquet shot of them, they on a sud∣dain Wheeled about, and fell upon the left Wing; which when the Duke of Loraine observed, he crossed the Line of the Caval∣ry on the left Wing; and with all the party of the first Line which had not been en∣gaged, he in Person charged the Enemy in the Flank with so much Courage and Bra∣very, as put them to a General Rout, and into that Confusion,The Turks routed. that they were never more able again to Rally: Dunewaldt was Commanded to Pursue them, and with the Poles of the left Wing enter'd pell-mel with them at the very Gates of Barcan, at which place many of them were killed, and peri∣shed in the Marshes of Gran. And pur∣sued.Whilst Dunewaldt pursued the flying E∣nemy, the whole Army advanced in Bat∣talia towards Barcan; and in the way thi∣ther it was resolved by all Parties to As∣sault the place in this heat of Action, whilst the Enemy was Affrighted and in Disorder; the King accordingly drew out some Troops of his Cosacks, and the Duke of Loraine five Battalions of Staremberg, Grana and Baden, which were appointed for that Service: Which Detachment was no sooner order'd, than Information came, that the Bridge over the Danube by the Crouds, and Multitudes of the Turks pressing over it was broken; and that Barcan it self was so filled up with People, that they had scarce room to stir, and were ready to tram∣ple one another Under-foot. Prince Lewis of Baden with these Forces, and three Re∣giments of Dragoons, and three Pieces of Cannon assaulted the Fort, and took it by main force.Barcan taken. The Slaughter which was there made by Fire and Sword was very Cruel and Bloody: But most, to avoid the Fury of the Enemy, threw themselves head-long into the Danube; some endeavoured to save themselves by Swimming, others by their Horses, hanging on their Mains and Tails; others on Planks and Boards of the broken Bridge; in which Passage thô many saved themselves, yet the greatest part perished in the Waters; as appeared by the Bodies of Men and Horses, together with their Garments, which cover'd the Surface of the River, in places where the Current ran not so rapid on the Sides and Banks, as in the middle of the Water. In fine, of these great numbers in Barcan none escaped, un∣less Seven or Eight hundred Men, who ha∣ving betaken themselves to a Redoubt be∣longing to that Fortress, obtained Quarter for their Lives on Condition of quiet Sur∣render. In this Action the Turks lost their best Captains, and the Bravest of their Soldiery, and so fatal was this Fight to them, that they never recovered their Cou∣rage and Spirits again, but suffer'd them∣selves for several years afterwards to be beaten, and baffled by their Enemes: After which we shall find them still decaying and giving Ground; and at length falling into Discords and Civil Dissentions, the Ottoman Empire had nearly expired, had not the Christians falling into Wars amongst them∣selves, (which have always proved advan∣tagious to the Turks,) given new Life and growth again unto that People. This Victory obtained, the King of Po∣land with his General and Senators, justly applauded the Wisdom and Conduct of the Duke of Loraine, and Valour of the Ger∣man Troops, to whom he acknowledged the whole Success of that day was to be attri∣buted: In the Quarters of the King Te Deum being sang, and Thanks returned to Almigh∣ty God for so signal a Blessing; the Duke of Loraine took a Survey of the Fort of Bar∣can, to see in what manner it was possible to be put in a condition to offend Gran, which was Situate on the other side of the Water, just in opposition to it: But such was the Fury of the Soldiers, that they burnt almost all the Palisadoes, and set fire to part of the Town; and so ravenous were they after the Plunder of the Place, that the Germans and Poles had fallen into Civil Wars amongst themselves, had not Count Staremberg put an end to the Scuffle, by commanding the Germans to with-draw;
and leaving the Poles Masters of the Place, they made all the Spoyl they were able, in revenge of the Loss they had suffered the day before. Nothing could come more sea∣sonable, nor more advantagious to the Chri∣stian Arms than this Victory; for besides the Loss (as we have said) of the best of their Men, there remained not above two or three Thousand alive of all that Army, which consisted of Fourteen thousand of their best Horse, and Twelve hundred Janisaries, com∣manded by the new Pasha of Buda, Haly, Pasha of Aleppo, and six other Pashas. Twelve hundred or One thousand Prisoners were ta∣ken, and amongst them the Pashas of Alep∣po and Silistria, with several other Agas. The Consequences of which Victory were very happy to the Christians; for besides, that it administred new Courage to the drooping Spirits of the Poles, it totally dis∣mayed the Malecontents, and produced such Disorder in the Turkish Army, that the Great Vizier,Mutiny a∣gainst the Great Vi∣zier. with all the Authority with which he was clothed, was not able to con∣tain them within any bounds or limits of Duty; but rather fearing to be Murdered by them than hoping to Appease them, was forced to abscond himself from their Rage in obscure Retirement. By this Overthrow the Grand Vizier lost all the remainer of his Baggage, which had been saved at the Battle of Vienna, with Twelve Pieces of Cannon, which had been advanced some Hours on the way before the Siege was raised, and was employed by the new Vizier of Buda for the Service of this Camp. The Duke of Loraine pursuing the course of his good Fortune, was desirous to con∣clude this Campaign with the taking of Gran, which was the glorious period to which the Emperor directed him, if possible, to advance his Affairs.The Siege of Gran in∣tended. In order hereunto the Duke of Loraine taking first (according to his usual Methods) a judicious Survey of the situation of the Place, and the way thereunto; observed, that in the middle of the River, something below Gran, there was an Island, in which was not only good Fo∣rage for the Horse, but also an ancient In∣trenchment, which, with some little Labour, might be made useful and defensive against the Cannon of the Town: And from the farther side of that Island, with the help of a few Boats, the whole Army might find an easy Passage. The King of Poland appro∣ving this Design, Boats were ordered down from Comorra, for framing the Bridge: But whilst this was doing, the late Successes which had brought great Reputation to the Empe∣ror's Affairs, had moved Tekeli to send the Count de Humanay in Behalf of the Malecon∣tents, to offer Terms of Peace and Pacifi∣cation. The Duke of Loraine, who had been long versed in the Practices of Tekeli and his Associates, was of opinion,Tekeli sends Depu∣ties to the Duke of Loraine. That the Malecontents were not as yet reduced to such Terms, as might render them fit and disposed for a Treaty: Howsoever, at the desire of the King of Poland, being admit∣ted to Audience, they proposed a Cessation of Arms, and an assignment for Winter-quar∣ters: To which the Duke of Loraine reply'd, That such Concessions at present were not agreeable to the Interest and Dignity of the Emperor, and took from hence occasion to make some Discourse of the Laws and Con∣stitutions of their Kingdom, and to reproach them for their Rebellion, and want of Faith towards their Sovereign. In short, he told them, That if they would hope to tast of the Emperor's Clemency, they must with∣out any previous Conditions lay down their Arms, and renounce all Alliance with the Turk, which was the first Preliminary or Step to a Treaty. With this answer the Deputies being retired, in a few days afterward,Several Towns and Counties Submit. not only Papa and Totis (as we said before) submitted, but Wespring and Levents received German Garrisons; and the Counties of Trinschin, Tirnaw, Nitria and Levents decla∣red against the Cause and Interest of the Malecontents, and received the Garrisons into their Castles and Fortresses, which were sent thither by order of Count Caraffa to take Possession thereof. The Bridges being finished by the 16th of this Month of October, and the Bava∣rian Troops come up to joyn with the Ar∣my; the Duke of Loraine desired the King of Poland, according to his Place of Pre∣cedency, to lead the way with his Troops; but the King made some difficulty thereof,The King of Poland proposes en∣quiries con∣cerning the State of Gran. alledging, That a Survey ought first to be taken of the situation of the Place, and En∣quiries made how well it was provided with Men and Ammunition, and how far the Vi∣zier, with his Forces, was retired from af∣fording it Relief, or disturbing the Siege. Accordingly Two thousand Horse being ap∣pointed to take a View of the Country, they passed the Bridges without opposition or di∣sturbance, and so dismayed the Turks, that they deserted Thomas-burg, a Palanca not far from Gran, and set it on Fire, but was soon quenched, and Possession taken by the Im∣perialists. Upon the appearance of a Party on this side of the River, two Hungarians of Totis brought Intelligence, that the Vi∣zier was marched with his Army towards Esseck, having left a small Force encamped near unto Buda. This News hastned the Passage of the Christian Army over the Ri∣ver, (tho' the Poles remained in their Camp, and moved not as yet) and gave Encou¦ragement to the Generals to hope, that the
Siege would not be of long Continuance, or of much loss of Time, or Men. The Horse and Foot marched apace over the Bridges into the Island, and so by a short cut, cros∣sed over another Bridge to the Banks of the Danube, something above Cannot-shot be∣low Gran. In the mean time, the Duke of Loraine, with the Chief Officers of both Ar∣mies, took a particular Survey of the Town, and of the Ground and Country thereabouts. Gran is situate about six Hungarian, or thirty English Miles below Comorra; it was anciently called Strigonium, but now by the Hungarians it is named Gran; from the Ri∣ver Gran, which comes out of the Upper Hungary, and empties it self in the Danube, just over-against the City. Under the Name of Strigonium, four Cities are comprehended, together with the Castle which is situate on the pitch of a high Rock hanging over the Danube,The Descri∣ption of Gran. and over-tops the Cathedral Church, where Stephen the first, King of Hungary, a holy and devout Prince, lies interr'd. In the Year 1543, this City was first brought under the Turkish Dominion, by Solyman the Magnificent. In the Year 1594 it was Be∣sieged by Mathias, Arch Duke of Austria, but was not taken until the following Year by Count Mansfield, who in a bloody Fight totally defeated the Ottoman Force. The Turks esteeming this Place of necessary Im∣portance to the Conquest of Hungary, re∣turned before it in the Year 1604; but finding a vigorous Resistance, were forced to raise the Siege after Twenty three Days continuance. Howsoever, in the Year 1605, investing the Place with a more formidable Power, it yielded it self into the Hands of the Turks, who have since that time remain∣ed Masters thereof until this happy Year 1683. The Imperial Army continuing its Pas∣sage over the Bridges, the Two thousand Men of the advanced Troops took their Post on the 21st and 22d at Night, not doubting but that the King of Poland would follow with his Army in the Rear,The King of Poland declines the Siege. as was before resolved; but, contrary to all expe∣ctation, the Duke of Loraine received Ad∣vice, that the King, by persuasion of his Senators, had changed his Mind, and de∣signed not to pass the River, letting him know, that he should continue his Camp for three or four Days longer; but after that he should be constrained to March away. This alteration in the King of Poland's Counsels, was strangely surprising to the Duke of Loraine; for thô he doubted not but in a short time to become Master of the Place with the Imperial Forces only, with∣out the Assistance of the Poles; yet consi∣dering that the News of the Separation of the two Armies, might encourage the Grand Vizier with his Army (which as yet was not far distant) to return to the Relief of the Town, and the Besieged to a more vi∣gorous Defence; and that the Malecon∣tents might be induced to Post themselves on the Danube, to intercept and interrupt all Communication between Comorra and the Camp: Which Matters were of such high Importance, that the Duke of Loraine thought not fit to form the Siege, until such time as he had first fixed the King in his former Resolutions; unto which he sent the Counts of Staremberg and Rabata, to press him with all the earnestness imaginable, gi∣ving him to understand how difficult it was for the Imperial Army to retire from an En∣terprise, to which all the Methods and Forms were already laid and prepared; and of which the Design appeared so promising, that in a few Days they might with good reason expect a happy Success and Event thereof. Moreover the Emperor had given his Orders for investing Gran, and was al∣ready in expectation to hear that the Siege was laid, esteeming it of high Advantage to the Reputation of his Affairs,He is per∣suaded to it by the Duke of Loraine. to have the Campaign concluded with the success of so glorious an Action: Yet whatsoever was or could be said by these Officers did not pre∣vail on the King, until the Duke of Loraine himself went in Person, to represent the great Inconveniences, and even Subversion of the late happy Successes, which would be the necessary Consequences at this time of the Separation of the two Armies. In fine, he so managed his Discourse with those Rea∣sons, and in such obliging Terms, that the King concurred with him, desiring him to hasten the execution of this Enterprise, in which there was no time to be lost, consi∣dering how near the Winter-season was ap∣proached. The Siege being now in good earnest re∣solved, the Polish Army passed the Bridges with all the Artillery, Ammunition and Bag∣gage; and the Duke of Loraine with the chief Officers taking a second Survey of the Town, and the Ground round about it; the Approaches were ordered to be made, and the Army began to take their several Quarters, as directed by the General Offi∣cers. The Foot were encamped on the tops of some rising Hills;The Dispo∣sition of the Christian Army in the Camp before Gran. the Croats and Dra∣goons, with a Party of Horse on the side of the Danube. The Bavarians were posted on the River above the Town, at the foot of the Bridge which passes over to Barcan, where a Battery was raised: The rest of the Infantry was divided into two other Squa∣drons towards St. Thomas's Mount, where other Batteries were raised, all things pro∣ceeding with such expedition, as the Sea∣son of the Year, and other Circumstances of
the Army requir'd. The Lines being drawn, which extended three Miles in compass, the Cannon, of which ten Pieces being twenty four Pounders, and eight Mortars were by force of Men drawn up and planted on the Top of the Hills of Marinberg, and Thomasberg, and on the 25th by break of Day in the Morning, they began to play upon the Town, and much Batter'd the Castle on that side of the Gate, which looks towards Buda, and all that Day Bombs were thrown, whilst the Imperialists in despight of the Enemies Fire advanced to the very Ditch,Their Ap∣proaches. and there lodged near to the Quarters of the Bavarian Troops. On the other side, which looks towards Barcan, about five a Clock in the Afternoon the Imperialists stormed the Lower Town, and without much resistence made themselves Masters of it, with the loss of the Major of Staremberg's Regiment, and seven Soldiers. The Inha∣bitants retir'd into the Castle, from whence they fired incessantly both small and great Shot: Howsoever, that very Night the Christians gained the Foot of the Hill, on which the Castle is Built, and began to un∣dermine the Place, there being a wide Breach already opened in the Wall of the Castle, so that every thing seemed in the readiness for an Assault; but before things were put upon that Extremity, the Duke of Loraine thought fit with the consent of the King of Poland, to send a Summons to the Castle in his Majesty's name, which was done by a Turkish Prisoner, offering them Conditions of safety for their Goods and Lives, provided that a Surrender were made that very Evening: But the Defen∣dants desiring until next Day to give their Answer it was deny'd them, and Attacks were made and the Ditch passed, and two Lodgments made on the side of the Hill, and another Mine began; of which the De∣fendants being sensible, and fearing to be taken by force of Arms,The Besie∣ged accept Conditions. they returned an Answer by Eleven a Clock that Night, how that they accepted the Conditions. In the Morning early, being the 27th, Hostages were exchanged for securing the performance of the Conditions, which were these. First, That all the Cannon, Ammuniti∣on, Provisions, and all offensive Arms, (excepting those hereafter excepted) should remain in the Castle. Secondly, That those of the Garrison might carry with them, as much Bread, Flesh and other Victuals, as would serve them for two Days Provision. Thirdly, That the Duke of Loraine should provide them with Carts, for carrying their Baggage to the Water side. Fourthly, That Boats should be granted them for carrying away their Persons and Goods, and that in case they could not be cleared away at one time, that then they might have Liberty to fetch them off at twice: And that in case the Boatmen were not sufficient to carry away all the Goods, that the Proprietors might have Liberty to perform the same. Fifthly, That so soon as these Capitu∣lations were Signed, that the Garrison shall immediately quit the place, and resign it into the Hands of the Christians, who were to take entire Possession thereof; and that the Carts and Boats being in a readiness, they should without delay lade their Goods and Houshold-stuff. Sixthly, That the Prisoners taken du∣ring the Siege, be forthwith released and set at Liberty. Seventhly, That the Defendants shall have Liberty to March away with their Wives, Children and small Arms, and also with their Horses, Camels, and other Beasts of Burden. In fine, That these Articles be kept, and observed inviolably on both sides. On the 28th of this Month of October, all the Garrison, being in number about Three thousand five hundred Soldiers, marched out of the Castle between the Re∣giments of Grana and Loraine drawn up in double Files; but before they would suffer them to depart, a search was made after the Mines, which the Turks discovering to them, they were discharged of their Powder:The Castle Surrendr'd. The Garrison marched forth without any Order, but mixed together with their Wives, Chil∣dren and Families: Those who designed for Buda, were embarked on Boats provided for that purpose; and such as were willing to go unto other Parts by Land, which were about Eight hundred Persons, were conveyed by Colonel Heisler with One thousand six hundred Horse. After all the Matters were past, and the Christians in possession of the Fortress, the late Governour thereof called Beker Pasha, and Oslan Pasha his Deputy, the Comman∣der in chief of the Janisaries, the Sagar∣gibashee and Samsongibashee, who are Ma∣jor Generals of the Janisaries, with many other Agaes and others, who had escaped out of the Battel of Barcan, desired great∣ly to salute the Duke of Loraine; who wil∣lingly admitted them to his Presence, and treated them with much Humanity: In their Discourses with the Duke they told him, That the defeat which the Turks had received before Barcan, was seen from the Top of the Castle of Gran, by the Garrison and Inhabitants therein; which sad Spe∣ctacle made such impressions of fear in their Minds, that they had no power or life
remaining to resist the Vigour, and speedy proceedings which the Christians shewed in the Prosecution of this Siege: The Arms and Ammunition found in this Fortress, were Sixty Pieces of Cannon, besides Twenty two belonging to the City below the Castle, Six thousand Barrels of Powder, Three Mortars, Match, Bullets, Granadoes, Bombs in great quantities, as also Flour, Barly, Salted Flesh, Rice and all sorts of Provisions sufficient to sustain that Fortress in a Siege for many Months. Thus was this City reduced in a far shorter time, and with much less loss than was expected by the King of Poland and his Senators; for which Te Deum was Sung, and Thanks render'd to God Almighty in the Cathedral Church of that Archbisho∣prick,Thanks re∣turned to God. after it had remained a Mahometan Mosch, in possession of the Turks for above One hundred and forty years: The Com∣mand of the place with a Garrison of Two thousand Men, was committed to the charge of one Carlovitz, Serjeant Major to the Re∣giment of Staremberg. The Elector of Bavaria, who for the sake of his Health, remained at Brin to take the Air by the prescription of his Physitians, hearing of the Siege of Gran, hastned thither to partake in the Triumphs of it: And coming into the Camp on the 26th of October, early in the Morning with a part of his own Cavalry, which was not employed in the Siege; he had the good fortune within the space of Twenty four hours, to behold the form and manner of the Siege, a Treaty offered and the place Surrendred. Soon after which the Imperia∣lists making their Incursions into the Coun∣try, took two Castles, one called Scombeck Situate between Gran and Buda, wherein were Four hundred Turks, and four Pieces of Cannon with much Provisions: And also another Castle called Sordeck, lying towards Alba, wherein were six Pieces of Cannon mounted, with abundance of Am∣munition and Provisions of all sorts. The news of these happy successes were posted to the Emperour by the Count of Auspurg, to the great Joy and Triumph of the Im∣perial Court. In this manner the Campagne being glori∣ously concluded to the great Reputation of the Emperor's Affairs, and to the Disgrace and Discouragement of the Turks; The next care and incumbence of the Generals was to provide Winter-quarters for the refresh∣ment and welfare of the Army,The Chri∣stian Army drawn into Winter-quarters. which had been much harassed by the Fatigues of many and great Actions. The Elector of Bavaria desirous in like manner to provide for his own Troops, hastned their march out of Hungary, together with the Marquis of Dorlach, who with Three thousand Men which he had conducted out of Suabia, ac∣companied the Elector, having remained but one day in conjunction with the Im∣perialists. To regulate and assign the Quar∣ters of the two remaining Armies, Com∣missaries were appointed: And thô accor∣ding to the Articles of Treaty, the Empe∣ror was not obliged to allow Winter-quar∣ters to the Army of Poland, intending to reserve all the upper parts of Hungary for the accommodation of his own; yet in re∣gard Conditions were not too strictly to be insisted on, with persons unto whom great acknowledgments are due, Quarters were assigned unto the Poles on the other side of the Tibiscus, in Parts near adjoyning unto Transilvania, which were the Quarters that the King declared he had desired, from the time he first enter'd with his Forces into Hungary. Howsoever, when his Majesty was on the place, the Prince of Transilva∣nia paid unto him a Sum of Money on Condition, that his Army should be re∣moved from thence, after payment of which they marched into the three Counties of Esperies, Cachan and Tokay, which were ap∣pointed to receive them, five of the Impe∣rial Regiments being dislodged from thence. But as the German and Polish Armies were marching towards their Quarters, on the Banks of the River Gran in sight of Leventz;Leventz taken. they sent their Summons requi∣ring the Governour to Surrender the place into their Hands, which in few hours time was yielded, and the Garrison permitted to march out. In the place were twelve Pie∣ces of Cannon well mounted, and Provisi∣ons and Ammunition in great quantities. The Croats found the like good fortune, having in their march taken the Castle of Raboniz, about six English Miles distant from Kanisia, and the Town of Probenz, Situate on the River Drave; as also the Castle of Esseghet,Esseghet, Provens, and other places ta∣ken. and the City and Castle of Brevenitz, which was so near to Kanisia, that it seemed already blocked up, if not almost besieged: And here these generous Soldiers thought fit to fix their Winter-quarters, which they had conquered and won, as if they had scorn'd to abide in any place which was not opened to them by their own Swords. The Duke of Lorain being at Sequi, about an hours march from Leventz, and busied in assigning Quarters for Twenty seven Re∣giments,The Forces of Litua∣nia with the Duke of Loraine. was visited by the General of Lituania, accompanied with the principal Officers, who gave him to understand, that they were come with an Army of Ten thou∣sand Men, which were Quarter'd in the Neighbouring Towns and Villages, and
that they were marching to joyn with the other Troops of his Majesty of Poland, and to follow his Orders and Instructions. The Duke after having courteously received them, prescribed them the Roads which they were to take, and deliver'd into the Hands of the General a Letter for the King, perswading him to employ that Army which was fresh, and not harrassed with the Fatigues of War, upon some Enterprise, it seeming somewhat absurd, and perhaps of ill report in War, for so considerable a Body of Soldiers, to take a long march out of Lituania into Hungary, and to per∣form nothing, but to return again. To this Letter the King made no other Reply, Than that for maintenance of his Winter-quarters, he should have occasion of those Troops. The King of Poland in his march to∣wards Cackaw, (which with Esperies and Tokai, were appointed for the Quarters of his Troops) passing near to the City of Setzin, sent his Son Prince Alexander with Summons to Surrender, which being refu∣sed, the Poles made an Attack in two places, with which the Defendants being affrighted, offered to Capitulate, and in that Amaze∣ment before the Articles were agreed,Setzin ta∣ken by the Poles. they opened their Gates and let in the Enemy, who being obliged by no Terms, made a miserable slaughter of the poor Inhabitants, of which there were Two thousand Turks, besides Twelve hundred Janisaries and Spa∣hees; and on the Walls were twenty Pieces of Cannon mounted. A Garrison of Germans being put into the Town, the King continued his march towards the Quarters designed for his Troops, where having refreshed him∣self for some few Days, he passed on to∣wards Cracovia,The King of Poland and his Army re∣turn home. attended only with the Servants and Officers of his Court: And not long afterwards was followed by his whole Army into Poland; where we will leave them to their own Fortune, which seemed favourable to them abroad, whilst they were directed by the auspicious Con∣duct of the Duke of Loraine, and other the greatest Captains in the World. But looking on them in their own Country, as we shall hereafter do, we shall find their Successes much different from their late Triumphs and Glories: For being left to themselves, and inspired with French Councils and In∣terests, we shall hear of no great Atchieve∣ments afterwards gained upon the Turks, nor attemps made to recover Kaminiec, the Bulwark and Fortress of their Kingdom on that side: Of which the Turks being sensible, made but weak Preparations a∣gainst them, leaving them to the Tartars, who (as things were then governed) pro∣ved a sufficient match for their Neighbours the Poles. Notwithstanding this separation, and that the Polanders were withdrawn in∣to their own Country;Several Castles be∣longing to the Male∣contents submit. yet the Reputa∣tion of the Emperor was highly exalted, and his name terrible to his Enemies, so that every small Castle and Fortress Surren∣der'd upon the first Summons; as the Ca∣stles of Jasem, Zalabstat, Sumstam and Se∣ramz, with other places all belonging to the Malecontents, of which divers Persons of Quality returned to their Duty and Al∣legiance, and particularly the Count of Zabbor, the Commander in Chief under Tekeli, who by the Count Esterhasi, being introduced to the Presence of his Imperial Majesty, he was with his usual Clemency received, and a gracious Pardon granted to him. These Triumphs in Christendom increa∣sed the Troubles, Discontents and Commo∣tions in Turky, which are always attended with Tragedies and Destruction of their Chief Ministers and Rulers. We shall be∣gin with the fate of Kara Mustapha the Grand Vizier, the Chief Author and Cause of all the Evils which are past, and those which for many years following are to en∣sue. We have in the beginning of this History, made mention how that the Valide Soltana which is the Queen Mother, the Kuzlir-Aga, who is the black Eunuch of the Women, and the Embrahore, who is Master of the Horse to the Grand Seignior, were all mortal Enemies to this Vizier, and at∣tended only an opportunity to destroy him, which was now very practicable, un∣der the present Circumstances of Affairs, especially having the Widow of the Pasha of Buda, whom the Vizer had lately put to Death, and who was Sister to the Grand Seignior, to joyn with them in their me∣thods of Revenge. The Grand Vizier be∣ing sensible of his Danger from these Ene∣mies, and from the ill success of Affairs, which usually prove fatal to the Generals or Commanders in Chief, marched away towards Belgrade with a great part of his Army, esteeming it a Matter of higher Con∣sequence to his own safety, to purge him∣self from blame in the Opinion of his Ma∣ster, than to return back to the Relief of Gran, being already advanced as far on his way to Belgrade as the Bridge of Esseck, where he received the first intelligence of the Defeat, of the several Pashas before Barcan, and the Siege of Strigonium. These misfortunes hastned his proceedings to Bel∣grade,The Grand Vizier ex∣cuses his Misfortunes before the Grand Seig∣nior. where being admitted to the pre∣sence of the Sultan; he described the admira∣ble order of the Siege before Vienna, and how near he was to have been Master there∣of, and even of all Austria, and the Em∣peror's Hereditary Countries, as Appendages
thereunto belonging, had not these fair hopes been defeated by the Cowardise, and ill Conduct of the Pasha of Buda, and sever∣al other Officers whom he had justly puni∣shed with Death for their Treachery, and want of Courage. He also laid much blame upon Tekeli, and on the Princes of Transil∣vania, Moldavia and Valachia, for not per∣forming their Duty, either out of Treache∣ry or Fear, or some secret Corresponden∣ces or Reserves for the Christian Interest, In fine, he so well mannaged his Discourse, and justify'd all his Actions with such Co∣lours and appearances of Truth, that the Grand Seignior who was naturally constant to his Ministers, and particularly favoura∣ble to this Vizier,And is acquitted. who had often feasted and treated him with Presents, and brought great Sums into his Treasury (no matter by what means) did accept of the Excu∣ses he had made as justifiable, and acquit∣ted him of all the Crimes of Misgovenrment which were laid to his Charge; and having received him to Pardon, and Grace, the Sul∣tan bestow'd the usual Presents on him in such Cases given, and bid him do better the next year, and so return'd to Adriano∣ple, leaving the Grand Vizier at Belgrade; but notwithstanding this new Re-establish∣ment in the favour of his Master, and tho' as some say, in Confirmation thereof, he obtained a Writing under the Hand of his Master, Promising and Engaging never to take off his Head upon any Instances and Ad∣dresses that could be made him: yet his Ene∣mies were busy in Contrivances to take him off; amongst which the most irreconcila∣ble of any was a Woman, the Grand Seig∣nior's Sister, Widow of the late Pasha of Buda, who perceiving that her Letters were not prevalent enough to obtain her desir'd Revenge; she undertook a Journey from Buda to Adrianople in Disguise, not being known on the way, until she discover'd herself at her Arrival at the Court; where being come,The Queen Mother Dead. she was entertained at the Entry into the Seraglio with the unhappy News of the Death of the Valide or Queen Mother, a Person much lamented by all, for her Piety and good Works, but especi∣ally at that time by this Sultana, who hoped to have used her as the chief Instrument of her Revenge: Howsoever, she was not a little comforted by the Kuzlir-Aga, or chief Eunuch of the Women, when he told her, that the Valide upon her Death-Bed, had charged him to tell her Son the Sultan, that his Affairs could never prosper, so long as they were in the Hands and Man∣nagement of so vile, and unfortunate a Per∣son as this present Vizier. But whilst they and others of the same Faction, were meditating of these Matters▪ Tekeli▪ who had heard of the Complaints made against him by the Vizier, and that he was in part charged with the miscarriage of the late Successes; fearing his own safety,Tekeli comes to the Grand Seignior. came and boldly presented himself at the Feet of the Grand Seignior, and in discharge of himself, solely laid all the blame upon the Vizier, which he confirmed by so many particular Instances, and by such Reasons, that the Grand Seignior assented to all his Allegations: But howsoever, not thinking it seasonable at present to stir greater Com∣motions by change of Officers, (to which he was never much inclined) he favoura∣bly dismissed Tekeli with new assurances of his Protection, and of sending him very considerable Forces, and Recruits against the next Spring. This Address of Tekeli had a little pre∣par'd the Grand Seignior's Mind to receive different Impressions, than what he had hi∣therto conceived against his Grand Vizier; which were soon afterwards ripened by new Commotions raised by the industry of the Faction amongst the Janisaries,The Jani∣saries de∣mand the Head of the Vizier. who Tu∣multuously assembling ran to the Grand Seignior, and crying out, that the Vizier had Treacherously forsaken their Compa∣nions, and suffer'd them miserably to Pe∣rish in their Trenches before Vienna, and had Unjustly and without any Reason put their Aga or General to Death; for which Crimes, and many other Miscarriages they demanded the Head of the Vizier. The Sultan (to whom nothing was so terrible as the Toleration of the Janisaries) entertained them with fair Words and Promises, and by distributing Money amongst them, for that time dispersed this Tumultuous Meet∣ing. But fearing the return again of the Rabble and this unruly Soldiery, a Divan or Council was called, at which the Mufti and all the Viziers of the Bench, with other Grandees of the Court were present: After a mature Consideration of the State of Affairs in the Empire, it was concluded of absolute necessity for ap∣peasing the Minds of the Soldiery, that the Grand Vizier should Dye,His Death resolved. who had been the Cause and Author of all the late Mis∣fortunes. Nothing could be more grie∣vous to the Grand Seignior than this advice; but being again terrified with the Threats of next days Commotions, the Imperial Command was signed for the Vizier's Death, and the Execution thereof commit∣ted to the care of the Chiaous Bashee, or Chief of the Pursuivants, and to the Kapigeelar-Kajasee, who is Master of the Ceremonies; which two Officers, with some few Ser∣vants were dispatched away Post to Bel∣grade. These Ministers of Death being near to the City, sent privately a Messen∣ger
to inform the Aga,  or General of the Janisaries of their Business, requring him in the Name of the Grand Seignior to be aid∣ing and assisting to them in this Work, that it might be performed with all the quiet, peace and silence imaginable. All things being disposed by the Aga accordingly, both he and the two Executioners went directly to the Vizier's Apartment, who, so soon as he had cast his Eyes on these new-come Guests, thô they were really his Friends, and had been his familiar Confidents for∣merly, yet he suspected much the Import of their Message; but being nothing surpri∣zed at what he had some time expected, he chearfully gave them the usual Salams or Salutations, demanding of them their Bu∣siness, which brought them to Belgrade: To which the Janisar-Aga made answer, That the Sultan demanded the Seal from him. To which the Vizier reply'd, Most willingly; and putting his Hand into his Bosom, he took the Seal out, and resigned it. What more, said he, is it that you re∣quire? The Standard, said the Aga; which was immediately produced and delivered. At last they produced the Command for his Head, which he having read, he said, Oh Deceitful World! After my Death the Grand Seignior will remember me, and the whole Em∣pire too late lament my Fall. He then after their usual manner washed, kneeled down and prayed, and yielded his Head to the fatal Cord:The Vizier's Death. Being dead, the Executioner cut off his Head, and the Skin being flead off, it was stuffed with Straw, and put into a Bag, and carried away in post to the Grand Seignior, and laid before the Gate of the Divan, on the 7th day of January, 1683/4. ANNO, 1684. IT is very seldom that a Grand Vizier falls into Disgrace, or is put to Death alone, but all his familiar Friends, Confi∣dents and Creatures, incur the same Fate, and either attend him to the next World, or are banished into remote Parts;The Muta∣bility of the Turkish Court. and some∣times the whole Set of Officers and Mini∣sters of State are changed with him. This Man had a corrupted Court, and was ser∣ved by Instruments of the same Humour and Temperament like himself, and which were either naturally ill-inclined, or made so by his Example. With him died the Tefterdar or Lord Treasurer, and several other Engines of his Rapine and Violence. The Estates of these Malefactors were sei∣zed and converted to the Grand Seignior's Coffers, which were esteemed in all to a∣mount unto 14 Millions of Dollars: to which Sum, and a far greater, it was belie∣ved, that Estate only of the Vizier would have amounted unto; but it is most certain he had disbursed vast Sums of Mony in this Expedition out of his own Treasure, ho∣ping to have had a return tenfold out of the Estates and Spoils of the Christians, in∣stead whereof his own Riches became a Prey to his Enemies; all the Mony (which as some Report) amounted to above two Mil∣lions found in his Tent, were all his own, and as they had been Acquisitions obtained by Force and Rapine, so they became the Booty and Spoil of the King of Poland, passing from the possession of one Covetous Man into the Coffers of another. The sublime Office of Great Vizier being now vacant, the difficulty of the present Affairs required to have it supplied with a Person of Valour, Wisdom and Experience; this Office, for which many Candidates pretended in former times, did now appear so weighty and full of Thorns, that the most ambitious amongst the Turks were willing to decline it, or at least not seem to seek or affect it. The Selictar Aga, or Sword-bearer to the Grand Seignior, called Soliman Aga,Soliman Aga. an ac∣complished Person in Mind and Body, a Man of good Sense, being always in the Eyes of his Master, and a Favourite, was pitched upon, as the most fit and proper of any for this Employment: But he excused himself to the Sultan with this Comple∣ment, That thô nothing in this World could be more desirable to him than this Office, yet since the execution thereof must necessa∣rily carry him from the adorable Presence of his Master, under the Shadow whereof he desired always to live, he could not with∣draw himself from thence without much Reluctancy and Discomfort, and therefore desired that the Seals might be conferred on some other Person, more worthy than him∣self. The Grand Seignior judging, that these Expressions proceeded from a Heart truly devoted to him, accepted of the Excuse, and resoved to constitute Ibrahim Pasha, then Caimacam with him at Adrianople, common∣ly known by the Name of Kara Kaia,Kara Kaia made Vi∣zier. in the Vizier's Office: He had formerly been Kaia, or Steward to Kuprioglee; and after his Death was made Embrahose, or Master of the Horse: He was afflicted with a Di∣stemper called a Serpentine or Cancer, which some Years since was caused by an Erysi∣pelas; some said it was a politick Disease to excuse himself from going to the War. He was a close politick Man, and become very weary and cautious by the Dangers and evil Fate of his Predecessors: As one means to secure his Condition, he frequently call∣ed and assembled all the Officers of the Di∣van, and with them consulted all of the Me∣thods in what manner the declining Condi∣tion
of the Empire might be recovered; concerning which, speaking his own Sense, he often declared, That the Errors of the late Vizier were to be retrieved, and a quite different Course to be steered; for whereas he had contrary to the publick Faith bro∣ken the Truce with the Christians, without just Reasons, before the time was expired, for which the Mussulmen had tasted the Di∣spleasure of the Divine Vengeance: They were now to appease the Anger of God,The Vizier proposes Peace. by renewing the same Truce, which had been injuriously violated with the Emperor, and observing it for the future, with such Faith as becomes the common Honesty of Man∣kind.Disliked by the Grand Seignior. But this Proposal was in no manner agreeable to the Mind of the Grand Seigni∣or; for thô he was naturally a gentle and a peaceable Prince, and disliked this War at the beginning: Yet like an unlucky Gamester, he was unwilling to give over with an ill Hand, hoping that the Wheel of Fortune might once again turn in his Favour: He had also promised Tekeli considerable Aid and Assistance against the next Campaign, and was unwilling to forfeit his Promise and Reputation with him. The Vizier finding a Disposition in the Grand Seignior to continue the War, desi∣red to be released from his Office, which the weakness of his Body rendred him un∣capable to discharge; to which the Sultan reply'd, That he was one of those, who had opened the Gate, by which much Di∣shonour and Mischief was entred into the Empire, and now would with-draw his Neck out of the Collar; but if he did not shut the Gate again, he would hang him in all his Divan Robes. The Turks indeed were then very low, and reduced to such distress for want of Soldiers, that from Selibrea, which is about thirty Miles from Constantinople, in all the Coun∣try of Romania, (except the Sea-coast) all that were capable of bearing Arms were sent to the War; but being raw Country People, proved of little Force against a Veterane Army. The Vizier finding himself disappointed in this Contrivance, and sensible of the pre∣sent Disadvantages, proposed that the War should be managed on the defensive part, rather than to adventure the whole Concern∣ment of the Empire on the Hazards and Chances of War,A defensive War in∣tended. which seemed to be go∣verned by some evil Influences of the Stars, which at that time were not very propi∣tious to the Ottoman Cause. This Council being generally well approved, it produced two Resolutions, one was to divert the in∣tended Design of the Grand Seignior's go∣ing in Person to the War; for in that Case nothing could become the awful presence and appearance of the Sultan, but Fire and Slaughter, and direful Vengeance whereso∣ever his terrible Sword was drawn; it being agreeable to the Opinion which the Turks fancy and conceive of their Emperor, That he is Omnipotent, and that in one Hand he carries all the Riches and Honours of the World, and in the other Victory, and all sorts of Delights for ever. But to draw this Case a little nearer to the Person of the Vizier himself; it was farther resolved, That in case a defensive War were to be managed, it were neither consistent with the Reputa∣tion of the Grand Vizier, who was the Sultan's Deputy and Representative; but more becoming a Sardar, with Title of Se∣raskier, or General to wage a War, in which the chief Art is to decline a Battel and all Engagements. Thus had this old and poli∣tick Vizier obtained his Point by sitting at Home, and seeing others play the Game, which he could approve or disapprove without danger, according to the Successes: The Person appointed to be Seraskier,A Seraskie appointed. or General, was Kara Oglou Chiamacam of Con∣stantinople, who had formerly been Captain Pasha, or Admiral of the Seas. The Grand Vizier remaining at home, had time to consider and reflect, That the cause of the general Toleration of almost all Christendom against them, did proceed from the Neglect, Contempt and ill Usage which the late Vizier had put upon all the publick Representatives of Christian Prin∣ces, some Instances of which we have given at the beginning of this History: To redress which, it was thought fit to cajole and soften a little the Foreign Ministers from Christian Princes, whom the late Vi∣zier had so contemptuously used, and treat∣ed with Disgrace, as had raised all Christen∣dom about their Ears; and so with much Complement the Ambassadors of England and France were invited to Adrianople by the Vizier, to sit with him upon the Soffraw,The Soffraw granted to the Christi∣an Mini∣sters. according to the usual Custom and Privi∣ledge of Ambassadors, which the Pride of the late Vizier would not allow them. The Lord Chandos, then Ambassador from his Majesty of Great Britain to the Ottoman Port, being at that time Sick, excused his going, and perhaps also was desirous to spare the Mony of the Turky Company, and not lavish it out in an empty and fruit∣less Journey: But the French Ambassador, Monsieur de Guilleragues, for the Glory (as he thought) of his Master, made splendid Preparations at the Cost of the Merchants, to enter Adrianople; where, being arrived, he was in a short time received to Audience on the Soffraw, which Priviledge hath been restored to all other Ambassadors since that time.
That which hastned this Favour and In∣dulgence to Foreign Ministers, was the ap∣prehension of a War just then breaking out with the Venetians; for the Doge of Venice being newly dead, and his Place supplied by Seignior Marco Antonio Gustiniani, the Senate sent Orders to their Secretary at the Ottoman Port,The Vene∣tians de∣clare War against the Turks. called Seignior Capello, to declare War against the Turk, and their League and Alliance with the Emperor and Poland; and having so done, to make his Escape in the best manner he was able. Seignior Capello having complied with these Instructions, conveyed himself away in the Habit of a Seaman, upon a French Man of War called the Faithful, which was come to Constantinople for Convoy to some other Ships. The Moscovites, who had for a long time plaid fast and loose (as we have formerly mentioned) in their Treaties of Peace with the Turks, became now more fixed and re∣solved on a War, being animated thereto by the strong Alliance and Confederacies made against them, and the cross Fortune of the Turks, which seemed every day to decline. This Union and strong Combination,The Mosco∣vites incli∣nable to en∣ter into the League. as it made the Turks tremble, so the Sense there∣of softned their Minds, and rendred them much more plyable and gentle to those Chri∣stian Ambassadors, who remained in Peace and Amity with them; and gave just occasi∣on to the English, and others trading in their Dominions, to applaud and own the Ju∣stice, Moderation, and easy Access of the Turks, much different from that, which they practised in the time of their Prosperity, so that thô our English Merchants, in all their Letters, complained of the badness of Trade, and ill Markets, yet they praised and com∣mended the present Security in which they lived, and the readiness of the Turkish Mi∣ninisters to afford them redress upon all Complaints. The Treaty of Confederacy and Alliance being vigorously carried on at Vienna, by Seignior Contarini, the Venetian Ambassa∣dor to his Imperial Majesty, by and with the Consent and assistance of the Pope's Nuncio, these following Articles were a∣greed between the Emperor, the King of Poland, and the Republick of Venice, and afterwards Sworn unto at Rome, at the Feet of the Pope, by Cardinal Pio in Behalf of the Emperor, by Cardinal Barbarini in the Name of the King of Poland, and by Car∣dinal Ottoboni for the Venetians. The Articles are these. THat a League offensive and defensive be concluded between the Emperor, the King and Republick of Poland, and Re∣publick of Venice; the which shall continue until the end of this War, and to be defen∣sive for ever. The Protector and Guarantie, whereof  shall be this Pope Innocent the XI. and his Successors; and the Apostolical See shall ever be Moderator to judge and determine which of these Parties falls from his Faith, and fails in a due Performance. That during the time that this League  continues in Force, none of the Parties shall enter into Treaty, or accept of any Condi∣tion, thô never so advantagious without the Consent, Privity and Concurrence of the other Allies. That his Imperial Majesty shall enter in∣to  this League, as King of Hungary, Bohe∣mia, and Arch-Duke of Austria; as doth al∣so the King, as King of Poland and Great Duke of Lituania, binding these their Do∣minions and Inheritances; as doth also the Republick of Venice, bind and oblige their Dominions and Territories to the perform∣ance of these Covenants. By this League is understood only a War  against the Turks, and against no other Prince or Potentate whatsoever. The Emperor for his part, and the King  of Poland for his, do promise to wage War against the Turks with very powerful Armies by Land: and the Venetians with a power∣ful Fleet at Sea, and with their Troops in Dalmatia to the utmost of their Force, until a Peace be concluded. That in case either of these Parties be  hard pressed by the Enemy, so that the Aid and Assistance of the others be necessary, they shall leave their present Designs, and Apapply themselves to the Relief of the Party oppressed. That this War be carried on by way of  Diversion, that is, That the Emperor en∣deavour to conquer and subdue all the Forts and strong Holds in Hungary, the King of Poland to recover Kaminiec, Podolia and Uk∣rania; and the Venetians the several Towns, Fortresses and Islands which they have lost. That so soon as these Articles are signed,  that the several Covenants herein contained, be put into immediate Execution. That all Christian Princes be invited to  enter into this League, and especially the Czar of Moscovy. That this League shall not be understood  to prejudice any other League made with any other Prince; particularly, That lately concluded between the Emperor and the King of Poland. Thus did the Senate of Venice, after Ma∣ture Deliberation, (for that Republick did never act rashly) enter into the Confedera∣cy with the aforesaid Allies against the Turks.
The many Insults and Avanias with which the Grand Vizier, and others did daily oppress them (of which at the beginning of this History we have given some In∣stances) and the difficult Circumstances they lay under by these hard Task-masters,The Rea∣sons which the Vene∣tians had to make a War. who were continually drawing, and forcing Mony from them upon false pretences, without which they always threatned War, were just Grounds and Reasons for breaking that Peace, which was concluded with them after the loss of Candia in the year 1668. This happy League was farther improved by Applications to the Czars of Moscovy, who had not long before signified unto the Court of Poland, their inclinations to en∣ter into this Alliance; to forward which the Baron of Zerowski was dispatched into Moscovy, and in his way thither, by Poland to take Blumferg with him, being both Com∣missionated to Sollicite the Czars for their Assistance and Union with the other Con∣federates. The like Addresses were made to the Princes of Italy, who being encoura∣ged, and warmed by the late prosperous Successes, were ready to contribute all the Force and Aid within their Power. The City of Rome moved by the Exhortations, and Ex∣amples of the Pope, did chearfully Concur, and the Cardinals, Princes and Prelates did all Contribute immense Sums for carrying on this Holy War: And the Pope did not only Issue forth liberally Monies out of his own Coffers, but sent Forces which were raised in his own Dominions and Territories, to joyn with the Imperial Army in Hungary:Aids from Italy. Thus did all things, according to the usual course of Nature, Concur towards the Pro∣sperity of the Christian Affairs; for Man∣kind naturally sides with the uppermost and strongest side, and are ready to depress, and beat down the weak and dejected Party. Nor did the Emperor only endeavour to fortifie, and strengthen his side by united Interests and Alliances; but to weaken his Enemies, by with-drawing from them the Malecontents, who were their Associates, and the first Incentives to this war: The Successes of the Emperor had damped the Spirits of the Malecontents in such man∣ner, that they began now to believe the Turks were vincible, and that they had put their Trust in a feeble Arm of Flesh, which could not Defend them, and engaged their Interest with a party, from which they could promise themselves no Security or Redress: Wherefore,Some of the Male∣contents fall off to the Empe∣ror. seriously laying aside their for∣mer ill Principles, many of the Counties and Cities began to Capitulate, and desire to have their Aggrievances redressed, upon which they promised to submit unto the Emperor's Pleasure, and return to their Obedience: But this good Humour being not general amongst all the Malecontents, but confin'd to some few Cities and Counties, no Capi∣tulations or Articles were Signed or Con∣cluded, so that notwithstanding their good Intentions, the Imperialists made Havock of them in all Places; and the Turks hear∣ing of their Inclinations to return again to their Obedience to the Emperor, and of the Steps they had made towards it,Their ill Condition. Treated them in all Places like Enemies, with Fire and Sword; so that miserable was the State of this poor People, who were become Ob∣noxious to both Parties; they had been the Original causes of the Mischief, and were likely to Perish in it. But the Clemency of the Emperor Commi∣serating their unhappy Condition, Published an Act of General Pardon to all the People of Hungary, who had been mislead,A General Pardon. and debauched from their Duty and Allegiance to their lawful Sovereign, Dated at Lintz in the Month of January 1684; whereby a Door was opened to a Treaty, and Pardon offer'd to all such who were desirous to re∣turn to the Protection of his Imperial Ma∣jesty, and to renounce their dependance on the Turks: This Edict was affixed in all publick Places, as Church-doors, and the Market Crosses, and dispersed in all the Frontier Garrisons, being Written in the Latin and the Hungarian Tongues, that none might pretend ignorance thereof. The direction was in this manner: To all the States and Orders, as well Pre∣lates, Barons, Nobles, as to all Free and Royal Cities, Counties and People, and to all Persons whatsoever (none excepted) within the Kingdom of Hungary. In the first place, The sad and deplorable Condition of that Kingdom being bewailed, caused by civil and intestine Discords, which evil and perverse Spirits had raised, and by their evil Perswasions had deluded many Thousands of poor Innocent Men, to Sacrifice their Lives and Fortunes to their Lust and Revenge, and even to joyn and unite them∣selves with the Turks, who were the ancient and irreconcilable Enemies to the Kingdom of Hungary, and the Christian Religion. And tho' His Imperial Majesty having been thus highly provoked by the Rebellions and Out∣rages of the People, and by the Power of his Victorious Arms might justly exempt, and re∣ject them from all Pardon: Yet his gracious Clemency prevailing, he doth once again offer his Mercy, to as many as before the end of February next ensuing, shall renounce and abandon the interest and party of the Male∣contents, and union with the Turks, and re∣pair to Presburg, where Commissioners shall be appointed to receive them, and to deliver out Pardons to them, taking a new Oath of
Allegiance to their King, with assurances to remain for ever as good Subjects, in perfect Loyalty and Obedience to his Majesty, which being perform'd, such as are of the Nobility shall be restor'd to their Honours, Dignities and Estates: And in case any such have for∣merly enjoy'd Honours, and Places of Trust, their Case shall be consider'd by the Commissi∣oners, who are to make Report thereof unto the Emperor, who will be ready in such Cases so to Act, as shall be most suitable to the Royal Service. Such Soldiers as having been seduced by their Commanders to leave and relinquish the Imperial Army, shall return a∣gain to their Duty, and to their Colours, shall have the same Post allotted to them as formerly, and shall be received again into the Garrisons, or Regiments respectively. All Counties and Cities, who by their Deputies shall appear before the Commissioners, in order to such Reconciliation, shall have safe Pasports to go, and return with all security. As to matters of Religion, the Worship of God, and Restitution of Churches, all the particulars agreed unto, and promised at the last General Diet held at Edemburg, shall be perform'd and inviolably maintained. As to the Sta∣tute made in the year 1655. concerning the Coronation of the King of Hungary, on which various Glosses and Interpretations have been put, which have caused great disorders and di∣sturbances; the same shall be referr'd to the next Convention of the States to consider thereof, and Decrees therein, what shall be most agreeable to the Fundamental Constituti∣ons of the Nation. So that a true, and im∣partial Interpretation being put on all things as well in Religious, as in Temporal Matters, a good and lasting Peace, and right under∣standing may pass between the King and his People. And as to those, who shall not take hold of this Golden Scepter now held forth unto them with this opportunity, and within the time limited: It is declared, That they are excluded from Mercy, and are guilty of all the Miseries, which shall fall upon themsel∣ves and their Country; and shall be Prose∣cuted as Rebels, Outlawed and Felonious Per∣sons, and such as are never more to be receiv'd into Grace, or Pardon. To put this Commission into Execution were appointed the Duke of Loraine, the Count Kinski Chancellor of Bohemia, the Baron of Abele, and Count Vinceslat of Altheim, who were to open the same at Presburg, on the 15th day of February. But in regard nothing was declar'd expli∣citely in this Decree, touching Liberty of Conscience, the Exercise of the Protestant Religion, and the Conservation of Privile∣ges, it seemed so short and narrow, and in∣comprehensive of the Cause, for which the Malecontents had so long contended, that very few thought it worthy the acceptance: Howsoever some there were, who being convinced by the Success of the Emperor, that they had engolfed themselves in a de∣sperate Interest, embraced the offers of the Imperial Pardon, such were the Baron of Baragotzi, who abandoning Tekeli's party,Several revolt from Tekeli. Fled with Three hundred Hussars into his Castle of Zakwar. The Count Humanai, and some other Hungarian Lords followed his Example, and fortified themselves in the Castle of Angwar: The Barons Ladisla∣us, Francis Baragotzi, Schienissi, Clebai and Malkai, intending a like Revolt were seized, and by Order of Tekeli were put to Death. With all these Misfortunes the Spirit of Tekeli being nothing abated, but rather rai∣sed with Rage and Despair; he Issued out a Proclamation of his own,Tekeli puts forth an Act of Pardon. in Imitation of that of the Emperor's, in which with an Imperial Stile, he declared Pardon to all such as should within a time limited, re∣turn to the defence of the Malecontented party, of which he had owned himself the Head and Protector: And for their better Encouragement he laid out a Project of con∣stituting a Republick, by which all the Nobility, and many of the Commonalty should come to bear a share in the Govern∣ment: And to punish those who had Re∣volted from him, he marched with a Body of 10.000 Men of his own, and a considerable force of the Turks under the Command of the Pashas of Buda, and Agria to Besiege Count Baragotski in his Castle of Zakwar, of which Count Rabata having advice, he presently marched with all his Forces a∣gainst them, which Tekeli fearing, declin'd an Engagement, in a Season when the Winter was scarce past; but on a suddain, turning his design on the Castle of Angwar, which was defended by the Count of Hu∣manai,Count Hu∣manai put to Death he took it by force in three Days time, and carried away the Count himself to Cassovia, where he cut off his Head. To revenge these Insults, the Lituanians, whom the King of Poland had left behind him in their Winter-quarters, made frequent Incursions upon the Countries of the Male∣contents, especially into the County of Sepusa, burning their Villages, and carrying away their Cattle. But this Militia remain'd not long in those parts, before they were recalled by the King of Poland out of Hun∣gary, either because he was informed that his Soldiers deserted daily, or else out of some pique, or discontent of being refused to be Mediatour,The King of Poland recalls his Forces. and Guaranty for the Peace with the Malecontents, for which Reason he declared, That he would not concern himself in a War against Tekeli and his Complices, but against the Turks only, to
which the Articles of Alliance did oblige him, and to no other. The Spring being now advanced, and Tekeli at Cassovia, he Wrote a Letter from thence to the Pope, Dated the 12th of April, wherein he represented; That ever since the last year he was very desirous to put an end to the Trou∣bles of Hungary,Tekeli Writes to the Pope. upon those Terms and Con∣ditions, which were agreed with the Baron Saponara. And being not able to obtain from the Emperor a Grant to constitute the King of Poland Guaranty of this Treaty, he was for∣ced to take new Measures, and to support Himself and his Interest under Protection of the Turks, which his Enemies interpreted to be a Renuntiation of his Christianity. But he sacredly protested to his Holiness, that he took up Arms for no other Reason and Cause, than the Defence of his Country, and to con∣serve himself from entire Ruin, having had the experience of many years, that the Em∣peror was in no State or Condition to defend him. That He and his Party did not deserve the Odious Name of Rebels, considering that the Arms they took up were in Defence only of the Liberties, and Privileges granted unto them by the ancient Kings of Hungary, and particularly by King Andrew the II. whose Letters are conserved amongst the Archives of the Vatican; which if his Holiness would be pleased to inspect and examine, he would easi∣ly find, that those Articles have been so far from being performed, that they have been wholly laid aside, and violated in every particular. That as to his own Person, he hath been des∣poyled of his Estate, and made an Exile in the very tender years of Youth, with others of the Hungarian Nobility, who could never obtain redress upon their complaints, but in∣stead thereof received Sentence of Death by corrupt and partial Judges, without any re∣gard to the formalities prescribed by Law. And tho' in this Cause not only Protestants, but great numbers of Catholicks were concerned, amongst which George Lippa Archbishop of Gran was one, a Person very Zealous for Re∣storation of those Liberties, which the Em∣peror had Sworn to maintain, when in the year 1655 he had received the Crown of Hun∣gary at Presburg; yet nothing could avail towards moderating the violent Proceedings of that Council, by which the Emperor was govern∣ed; so that having no other remedy, they were enforced as their last Refuge, to have recourse unto their Arms, not with design to act against the Catholick Religion, or to the prejudice thereof, either in Hungary or elsewhere, but only to maintain those Liberties which were established by Law, and confirm'd by several Diets. In fine, He beseeched his Holiness to Judge of his Intentions by this Declaration, ra∣ther than by the Sinister Reports of his Ene∣mies, to whom he wished a long Life, and a happy Pontificate. The Pope having received this Letter as∣sembled a Congregation of the Cardinals at which the Ministers of the Emperor, and the King of Poland were present, to delibe∣rate, and consider what Answer was fitting to be returned thereunto. The Season of the year being now far ad∣vanced, both sides prepar'd for War. The Seraskier, called Kara Ibrahim.The Seras∣kier comes to Belgrade having taken his Farewel of the Grand Seignior and Great Vizier, departed from Adrianople in the Month of May, and arrived at Belgrade where he found a Body of 60.000 Men, of which he sent one half to the Army de∣signed for Poland, with which Recruit they became a Hundred thousand strong, and lay Encamped near the City of Nicopolis: With the remainder the Seraskier marched to Buda, where he joyned with 20.000 more, and expected the Auxiliary Troops of Asia; which amounted unto 30.000 effective Men;The Tur∣kish Army. so that the whole Force this year of the Ottaman Army in Hungary only, amoun∣ted unto 80.000 Men, besides 15.000 which were appointed for the Guard of the Bridge of Eseck. Nor were the Preparations less consider∣able at Vienna, thô a diversion was much fear'd of the Imperial Forces, by the Jealou∣sies which the Arms of France gave in Flanders and upon the Rhine, and the Pre∣tentions which the French Ministers were daily making at Ratisbon,Fears from France. and in other Courts of the Empire, by which there was some appearance, as if a Check would be given to the smooth and prosperous proceedings of the Imperial Forces in Hungary. This surmise was cherished by those, who were desirous to clap up a Peace with the Turk, alledging that it was impossible to carry on a War in Hungary, and at the same time resist the formidable Force of France in Alsatia, and on the Confines, and perhaps in the very Heart of the Empire. But God, who by his Divine Providence Governs all things, was pleased out of his Com∣passion to Christendom to incline the Heart of that King to be Christian, and to accord a Truce with the Empire for some years, that so he might take off the Scandal of being a Friend to the Turks,That King makes a Truce with the Empe∣ror. and of inter∣rupting the Progress of the Christian Arms against the Common Enemy to the Faith of Christ. In fine, The dread of a French War being vanished, the whole Gross of the Imperial Army came to refund it self upon the Turks, and was in number and quality as follows. The Infantry were in all Twenty seven Re∣giments, 55080 The Cavalry all armed with Back and Breast, 12800
Dragoons, 5600 Polanders hired and paid by the Emperor, 4000 Croats who were Horse, 3200 One Regiment in Vienna, 1200 Twenty Independent Companies in Rab, Gran and Comorra, 3000 In all 84880 Besides the Confederate Army under the Duke of Bavaria, which made about 20.000 Men, so that the whole Chri∣stian Army this year composed a Body, In all 104880 Men But how numerous soever this Army seemed to be, yet after the Garrisons were out of it supply'd, and Forces sent into Al∣satia, and to the Rhine; and considerable Detachments into Croatia and Stiria, and Parts of the Upper Hungary, the main Body remaining with the Duke of Loraine, did not amount to above Forty thousand Men, with which he designed the Siege of Buda.The Siege of Buda intended. This was an Enterprise becoming the Valour of so great a Cap∣tain, for the Town was Defended by a Garrison of Forty six Chambers of Janisa∣ries, each consisting of One hundred and fifty Men, besides Spahees and the Militia of Rascia, which in all composed a Body of Twelve thousand effective Men. The City of Buda it self is raised on a Hill, and is na∣turally very strong; under it there is ano∣ther Town Built by the Turks, which is called the Lower Buda. But before Ap∣proaches could be made hereunto, it was judged necessary to secure the Navigation down the Danube, for carrying the heavy Cannon, and Provisions necessary for main∣tenance of the Siege, which could not be done but by taking the strong City of Vicegrade with the Castle, which so far commanded the River, that no Boats, or Vessels could pass down the Current with∣out being infested by the Cannon of the Place. For Vicegrade is Situated on a Rock on the side of the Danube between Gran and Buda,Vicegrade. but much nearer to the latter, and is fortified by a Castle erected upon a small Hill. This place hath been so considerable in former times, that it was the Residence of the Hungarian Kings, of which there re∣main great Ruins to this day of sumptuous and magnificent Palaces. The Crown of the Kings of Hungary was anciently conser∣ved in this place; but as the Turks advan∣ced in their Conquests, for better security it was removed to Presburg. This Crown is of a different Figure from that which other Princes use; for it is very low, with a Cross on the Top, encompassed with four Leaves, of which one is larger than the other three.The Crown of Hunga∣ry. This Crown is held in great estimation by the Hungarians, being, as they say, brought down from Heaven by an Angel, and planted on the Head of their King St. Stephen. It being necessary (as we have said) to take this place to make the way clear, and open unto Buda, the Duke of Loraine caused a Body of Horse to pass the Bridge of Gran; and be∣cause the Country was full of Woods and Inclosures, all the Baggage and Incum∣brances of the Camp were left under the Cannon of Gran, with a Guard of four Regiments of Foot, and a Detachment of Six hundred Horse, besides four Battalions of Count Kaiserstein, Commanded by Ge∣neral Hailewell;Hailewell. with the rest of the Army the Duke of Loraine marched away, and having pitched his Camp about an hour's distance, or three English Miles from Vice∣grade, he with some other Officers took a view of the place: And on the 16th day of June by break of day in the Morning,Vicegrade battered. he raised his Camp, and by nine a Clock the same Morning the Foot and Dragoons had taken their Post upon a Hill, where they brought up some Mortar-pieces and Cannon, and began to Batter the Town: But it being consider'd, that this would be a long work, an Assault was resolved, as the shortest and most expedite course to put an end to this Action. Count Ernest of Staremberg disposed and directed in what manner the Attack should be made; and the Duke of Newburg commanded during the time of it's Execution. The Cavalier Rosne in despight of the Enemies Fire broak in at the first Gate, and being come to the second, the Baron of Asti with his Grana∣diers threw himself over the Walls into the City,And is stormed and taketh. by which time Rosne having broak in at the second Gate, the Defendants began to give ground, and retreat into the Castle, but so precipitous was their Flight, that be∣fore they could croud into the Gate, many of them were cut off, and killed by the Enemy; after which the City was Sacked, and delivered up for a Prey into the Hands of the Soldiery. The next day by three a Clock in the Morning, the Duke of Loraine took a view of the Castle, and designed to raise divers Batteries against it, for that the Bombs by Reason of the Figure of the Castle which was long and narrow, could not easily take place: But whilst these Batteries were raising, the Duke sent a Herald with a menacing Summons, that in case they should refuse to Surrender, he would deliver them up into the merciless Fury of the Soldiers. The Turks being
astonished at the Resolution and Bravery of the Christians, were affrighted into a Trea∣ty; and Hostages being given on both sides, it was agreed, That the Besieged should have Liberty to March out with their Arms, Bag and Baggage, Wives and Children, lea∣ving behind them all the Artillery and Am∣munition belonging to the Place.The Casl is also sur∣rendred. The Sol∣diers were no more than Six hundred in all, who were transported in Boats into the Island of St. Andrew's, to pass from thence to Walt: In the Castle were only six Pieces of Can∣non, (on four of which were the Arms of the Emperor Rodolfus;) the Provisions and Ammunition also was very small and incon∣siderable, which might be the true Cause of this sudden Surrender; for otherwise the Castle was very capable of making a longer Defence. As things were passing in this manner be∣fore Vice grade, News was brought to the Duke of Loraine,The Turks fall on the Baggage before Gran. that the Turks had made an attempt on the Baggage which lay under Command of the Guns at Gran, and that the Regiment of Rabata had been worsted; upon which News the Duke of Neuburg with his Horse took the Allarum, and hastned to their Assistance, and was followed also by the Duke of Loraine; but in their way thi∣ther, they received Letters, that the Di∣spute was already decided in favour of the Christians; for thô they lost Eighty Men, which were killed, together with Major General Hailewell, who was run through the Body in two places with a Lance, and Baron de Kery, with a Lieutenant of the Re∣giment of Taff; yet the Turks having at length been beaten out of the Field in disor∣der, and with a loss of One hundred and twelve Men which lay dead in the Field,Are put to flight. the Victory clearly appeared in favour of the Christians: Count Rabata, Nephew to the General of that Name, was taken Prisoner, but was afterwards rescued by two Horse∣men. whom he well Rewarded for that great Service. The Death of Major General Hailewell, a Soldier of long Experience and undaunted Courage, being lamented with such Grief and Sorrow as Soldiers usually express in the time of War for each other; The Duke of Loraine supplied Vice-grade with a Gar∣rison of Five hundred Men out of the Regi∣ment of the Duke of Neuburg, the Com∣mand whereof was given to the Baron d Ambouche, Sergeant Major of that Regi∣ment: The Duke of Loraine having refresh∣ed his Army for some short time near unto Gran until the Troops were come from Vice-grade, he raised his Camp on the 20th of June, and traversed the Danube over the Bridge at Strigonium, and by next Day in the Evening the whole Army, Cannon, Bag∣gage, and every thing being passed over, they continued their March towards Pest, where the Recruits of the Silesian Forces were expected: The March thither was difficult through Woods and narrow Places, so that on the 27th they encamped near Witzen, in sight of Fifteen thousand Turks, under the Command of ten Pashaes, and Eight thou∣sand Tartars, with their Officers,A Fight near Wit∣zen. who were drawn up in Battalia on the side of a Hill; the Access unto which was very diffi∣cult over Rocks and Bushes, and broaken Ways: On their right Wing they had the Danube, and on the left a Bog or Morasse; the Imperialists immediately upon this ap∣pearance, put themselves into a Posture of Battle, with as much speed as the difficulty of the Place would permit, having their right Wing towards the Danube, and their left towards the Mountain, extending very largely their Front, they marched close and slow to pass the rough and broaken Ways, which thô the Turks defended with four Pieces of Cannon, yet Prince Lewis of Ba∣den forced through, as did also Count Sta∣remberg, and gained the Pass, bringing some Pieces of Cannon to make good their Post. The Turks began now to move, and to charge the Regiment of Taff, which was in the middle of the Line, with their usual Cries of Ala, Ala: The Duke of Loraine who was in that part of the Army, which was the middle, so as to be more ready to relieve those Troops, which he percei∣ved most in distress, had his Horse killed under him by a Pistol-shot, as had also two other Cavaliers, who road near his Person; but they being again remounted, the Chri∣stian Troops moved with a regular Order, keeping themselves close and firm like a mighty Wall: The Turks charged them three times, endeavouring to break into their Bo∣dy; but being every time repulsed with some loss, they began to give way and to retreat; but Rallying again, they made another Charge; but failing in the Attempt, and not able to break into the Enemies Ranks, the Christians pressed them so hard, and put them into such Disorder,The Turke are defeat∣ed. that they fled and trampled one upon the other, lea∣ving their Cannon, and the Janisaries which guarded them, to shift for themselves, who being surrounded with several Regiments, were all cut to pieces. In this Battle about Six or Seven hundred Janisaries were killed, great numbers en∣deavouring to swim over to the other side were drowned in the Danube, and about Three hundred Prisoners were taken: The Turkish Cavalry for the most part saved them∣selves in Pest, by the swiftness of their Hor∣ses, which thô not so strong in Battle as the German, yet more nimble and useful in
Flight. There were no more than six Pie∣ces of Cannon taken, without other Spoyl either of Tents or Baggage; for this Force being only a Detachment sent from Buda to give some Interruption, and stop to the Pro∣gress of the Enemy, they carried no Incum∣brances with them, which commonly cause Camps to move slowly. The Garrison of the Fortress of Witzem, beholding from the top of the Castle the Success of this Fight, were put into such Consternation, that upon Summons from Count Schaffemberg, they surrendred without Terms or Conditions, but at Discretion; all the Persons therein, to the number of Fifteen Hundred, were made Captives, and put into the Emperor's Gallies, which row on the Danube, for the Service of the Army. The Duke of Loraine having in this manner secured the Passes, which obstructed the Navigation of the Danube, he caused the whole Army to march towards Pest, and up∣on the 30th of June, he encamped about three English Miles distant from that City; over which, in the Evening about Sun-set, appeared a great Fire and Smoak, which was judged to arise from the Town,Pest set on Fire by the Turks. and that the Turks themselves intended to Burn it to the ground: By break of Day in the Morning, the Duke mounting on Horse-back at the head of his Cavalry, (ordering the Foot to follow him at leisure) he ap∣proached near the Walls, and gave orders to a Detachment of Dragoons to make dis∣covery of the State and Condition of the place, which was soon found to have been set on Fire and abandoned by the Turks, only a few remained, who had not time with the rest to pack up their Baggage and be gon; these endeavouring to make some little Opposition were killed, and three Co∣lours taken; those who escaped fled over the Bridge, and broak off Fifty of the Boats to prevent the Pursuit of the Enemy, which floating down the Current, were taken up by the Christians. The Duke of Loraine being come to Pest, caused the Fire to be extinguished, which had as yet Burnt but one third part of the Town, all the Stores of Ammunition and Provision being saved: The Works and Fortifications were ordered to be repaired, and Cannon to be mounted on the Walls; but the Place pro∣ved too hot for them, being so much in∣commoded by incessant shooting from Buda, that there was no abiding for them there; for Pest lies in a beautiful Plain, and gives Denomination to the Country round about, which is called, Comitatus Pesthiensis: From Buda it hath a sumptuous Prospect, by the appearance of the Towers on the old Walls, and Spires of the Moschs, but is so over-topt by Buda, that all the Cannon there can shoot into it; so that the Imperial Ar∣my quitted the Place, until it should fall into their Hands, and follow the Fate of Buda, as an Appendage or Dependance thereof. The Troops being with-drawn from Pest, they marched back to Witzen, where two Bridges of Boats were making to pass the River at the Island of St. Andrew's, where the River divides it self in two Branches,The Chri∣stian Army repasses the Danube. and makes the Ferry over much more short and easy. The Passage over the first Branch or Arm was not very difficult; but that on the farther side of the Island was much more hazardous, by reason that the Stream was broader and more rapid; and the Turks with 20.000 Men encamped within three Miles from the Banks of the River; but nothing seemed now too hard or dangerous to a victorious Army, and an invincible Captain; for whilst the Bridge was finish∣ing with incredible Expedition, some Sol∣diers for Spyes swam over to the other side, where having observed,July that the Turks lay with much Security within their Camp, and without any motion; (which was a strange thing, considering that they might easily have defended the River, and made the Pas∣sage over impossible) Five thousand Foot, with some Pieces of Cannon were ferried over in Boats, where being landed without any disturbance, they intrenched themselves, and raised a Battery, from whence they could shoot into the Enemies Camp, and secure the Passage of the Water for the rest of the Army. On the 10th of this Month, the Bridge being finished, the whole Army passed over the same Day, and joyned themselves with the other Body already on that side. The Seraskier being informed, that only a part of the Army was got over, he advan∣ced against them with all his Horse, and eight Hundred Janisaries,The Sera∣skier As∣saults the Christians. and two small Field-pieces; with him were the Pasha of Buda, and thirteen other Pashas, leaving the rest of the Janisaries, and all other his Foot, with the Cannon about the distance of an Hour's March: The Attack which the Turks made was so suddain, that the Christians had scarce time to put their Forces into or∣der of Battail; but howsoever such was the readiness of this Army, and the good Dis∣cipline of it, that every Regiment and Troop at the first sound of an Allarum took their Places without the least Confusion. The Duke of Loraine, at the head of his Ca∣valry, undertook to lead the Van, and there∣with sustained the first shock of the Enemy with Carbine-shot only, standing so firm and resolute, that no breach could be made into their Ranks; in which time, the rest of the Army had opportunity to put them∣selves into posture of Battle, which, upon
their Motion, appeared so formidable, that the Turks began to make a disorderly Re∣treat,He is repul∣sed and fies. and to fly as fast as their Horses could carry them, until they came to the Place where the Janisaries and Cannon remained: Howsoever, being closely pursued by the Polish Horse, many of them came short home, and several Colours were taken; nor was this Action without some loss to the Christians, and particularly of some Persons of Note and Quality, as namely, The Count de Velheim, Bernardino Scotti, a Gentleman of Milan, with some other Voluntiers of Heroick Courage, who pressing too forward to signalize their Valour, ended their days with much Honour and Glory. The next day being the 11th,July the whole Christian Ar∣my advanced towards Buda, between which, and a Party of the Turks there happened a Skirmish, to the disadvantage of the latter; with which, and with a constant Train of other ill Successes, the Turkish Army being cowarded and dismayed, with-drew them∣selves out of the open Plains, to seek shel∣ter under Hills and Mountains, and lodged themselves near St. Gerard's Mount; whilst Major General Staremberg, advancing near the City, began to prepare Matters necessa∣ry towards a Siege. The 13th the Turks set fire to the lower Town of Buda, and retired into the upper, which was situate on a Hill, and defended by a strong Castle. The Fortifications here∣of were not very regular, but made of old Towers without Bastions; but the Garrison consisting of Eight thousand Men, was the best of its Strength, Commanded by five Pashaes, and well supplied with all sorts of Ammunition and Provision; the Governour was the Vizier of Buda, and under him, as his Deputy-Governour, was Shitan Ibrahim, of whom we shall hereafter have occasion to give a more particular Character. The 14th a small Attack was given, and designed purposely as a good Omen to the Soldiery, who still retained in their Memo∣ries, that the same Day of the Year past, the Turks had formed their Siege before Vi∣enna;The Siege of Buda form∣ed. and this very Day the Duke of Lo∣raine had brought his heavy Cannon to the places of Battery, and had now perfected a formal Siege against the capital City of Hungary: The next day the Cannon be∣ginning to play, they made themselves Masters of the Ditch, and of St. Gerard's Mount, which Commands the Town, and thereon a Battery was raised. The Sera∣skier finding that his Army was dismayed, and neither for their Courage, nor Numbers, a competent Match for their victorious Ene∣my, retired three Leagues distant from Bu∣da, intending often to trouble and infest the Besiegers with continual Alarums. Whilst these things were thus acting, the Duke of Loraine received Advice, that the Pasha of Maroz, who was appointed to guard the Bridge of Esseck, was advanced with Two thousand Five hundred Men to Vitro∣vitz,The Pasha of Maroz overthrown a Place about a League distant from the Camp, expecting Four hundred Men more under Command of the Bei of Gra∣disca, with design to force their way in∣to Buda: To prevent which, the Duke de∣tached Four thousand Croats under the Command of Count Transmandorf to march against them, and ordered the German For∣ces to stand all Night to their Arms to avoid a Surprise. Transmandorf marched until seven a Clock in the Morning always a-trot; and having about that time met the Pasha of Marotz, he immediately engaged with him, and charged him so furiously, that after some small Resistence, the Turks fled; of whom about a Hundred were killed in the Pursuit, and several Prisoners taken. After which Success, Transmandorf returning back to the Camp, fortunately Encountred the Governour of Gradisca with his Four Hundred Men, who, going to joyn with the Pasha of Marotz, (of whose ill Success he had as yet received no Intelligence) was engaged and defeated by him upon the first Charge or On-set, and had all been cut in pieces, had they not been favoured by the shelter and thickness of some neighbouring Woods. On this Occasion the Croats took fourteen Colours, with several of their Cymbals and Trumpets, and twenty Prisoners: They lost only fourteen of their Men, and had the Pillage of the Camp, with great store of good Provisions, with which they feasted themselves, and nourished their Horses. And now let us leave the Duke of Loraine for a while before this City, employed in an Enterprise, which could not be effected until two Years aferwards, thô all that time a constant course of ill Fortune ran against the Turks: And let us see what Pre∣parations were making at Venice, and re∣count the Actions and Atchievements which this Republick carried on this Year against the Turks, pursuant to the Proclamation of War lately published. The Doge of Venice, called Marco Anto∣nio Gustiniano, who entred upon the Govern∣mernt the 26th day of April of this Year,  together with the Council, made choice of these General Officers for carrying on the War: Namely,The Veneti∣ans prepare for War, and nomi∣nate their Officers. Francisco Morosini Captain General, Dominico Mocenigo Proveditor Ge∣neral of Dalmatia, the Prince of Parma Ge∣neral of the Infantry, Alessandro Molino and Antonio Bembo Captains extraordinary of the Ships, Paulo Michiel, Matthew Pisani and John Morosini Commanders extraordinary of the Galeasses; and General Strazoldo quit∣ted
the Imperial Service for that of the Re∣publick. The whole Venetian Fleet consisted of Sixteen Gallies, six Galleassas, and sixteen Sail of Ships; to them were joyned five of the Pope's Gallies, and seven of Malta, and four Gallies belonging to the Great Duke of Toscany. With part of this Fleet the Captain General Morosini put to Sea from the Coast of Italy, on the 10th of June, for the Island of Corsu,Rendez∣vous at Corsu. where the general Rendezvous for the whole Fleet was ap∣pointed: At this Place a Council of War was called, where all the General Officers were present, together with the Proveditor General Cornaro, and General Strazoldo; and by them it was unanimously resolved to Attack the Island of Santa Maura. This Island of Santa Maura was former∣ly joyned to the Continent of Greece, and reckned amongst the Western, as those of the Archi-pelago were amongst the Eastern Islands; it was anciently known by the Name of Leucas,Santa Mau∣ra. and was part of the King∣dom of Ulysses. It was once a Peninsula, adjoyning to Epirus by a narrow Isthmus of Land, but at the great Charge and La∣bour of the Inhabitants of Corinth, it was cut off from the Continent, and made an Island: It is near the Morea, at the entrance into the Gulf of Lepanto, where was fought that famous Battle in the Year 1571. Sultan Mahomet, the Son of Sultan Amu∣rath, took this Island from the Venetians in the Year 1457. But with the Aid and Assist∣ance of some Vessels from the Pope, King Lewis the 12th of France, and the Knights of Rhodes, it was, after a bloudy Fight, recovered out of their Possession, in the Reign of Bajazet the II, in the Year 1499, Benedetto Pesaro being General. But the Year following a Peace being made, it was restored to the Turks, conditionally, That the Island of Cephalania should remain to the Venetians for ever. This Island being the chief Harbour at present, and Refuge of all the Pyrates and Corsairs of Barbary, which much infested the Gulf, and rendred the Navigation very unsecure, and which hindred the Venetians from being the ab∣solute Masters of those Seas, this Enterprise was resolved to be the most necessary and methodical in order to more important Ad∣ventures. Accordingly, on the 19th of July, the whole Fleet, together with Tartanas and Fe∣lucas carrying Land-forces, set Sail from Cor∣fu, and the next day arrived at Little-more, then Cannon-shot distant from Santa Maura, where they cast Anchor, and landed their Forces, which consisted of two Battalions of the Pope's, and of Malta Six hundred Men each, and Eight hundred Men drawn out of other Troops: Amongst those of Malta were a Hundred Knights, who, clad in their Coat-armours of red Sattin, with the white Cross of their Order, made a splendid Appearance. The next day the whole Fleet entred the Port of Demata, which lies to the Eastward of the Town, and is capable to receive great numbers of Vessels, and the Captain General Morosini went in Person on shoar, taking a view of the several Posts, in which the Forces had lodged themselves, and of that particularly called Chiche, which was a House of Plea∣sure belonging to the Aga's Son, possessed by Captain Manetta. But before Morosini thought fit to commit any Act of Hostility,Summons sent to San∣ta Maura. he sent to Summon the Place; and in a Wri∣ting set forth the Cause and Reasons which moved the Venetians to raise a powerful Army against the Turk, who had violated the Peace, by harbouring the Corsaires of Barbary, and practised other Hostilities against the Subjects of that State: And that in case they did not Surrender up their Town and Island, the next Morning he would proceed to force them, and make use of the Priviledge and Power of a Conqueror. To which the Go∣vernour returned no other Answer, Than that God would punish the Venetians for viola∣ting the Peace, and making an unjust War upon the Grand Seignior. Whereupon, the Admiral-Flag being spread, which was the Signal of Battle, the Gallies and Galleasses made above Twelve hundred Shot against the Town,The Batte∣ries. which did great Damage to the Houses and Fortifications, and entirely rui∣ned one of the Moschs. Nor were the Turks idle, but fired continually, thô with no great hurt; for their Cannon being mounted too high, did not hinder the Forces of the Pope, Malta and Toscany from posses∣sing themselves of the Suburbs, nor the Batteries from raising, which by direction of Lorenzo Venier, plaid on the Walls with good Success, and did great Execution, and the Bombs which were thrown into the Town put all the Defendants into a Conster∣nation. For, on the first of August, the Bat∣teries had razed a Bulwark to the Ground, and widned the Breach, and dismounted four Pieces of the Enemies Cannon, and the Bombs had set Fire to several parts of the Town; and so far was the Siege carried on, in order to a general Assault, that on the 6th of August the Turks hung out a white Flag, as a Signal that they would Capitulate: Accordingly a Treaty was had, and Hostages given, and at length an A∣greement was concluded, That the Turks with their Families might have Liberty to leave the Town, with so much,The Turks parly and surrender and no more than they could carry on their Backs. The Garrison being Seven hundred Men, to∣wards
the Evening marched forth with Sword and Musquet, and were ship'd and carried on the farther Shoar of an Arm of the Sea; all the Christian Slaves were set at Liberty, on Condition to serve on Ships and Gallies of the Republick, in the Quali∣ty of Seamen and Soldiers. The Venetians entred the Town at the Breach; the Plunder whereof, which was considerable, was gi∣ven to the Soldiers: In the Place great store of Provisions were found, with Eighty Pie∣ces of Cannon: The Venetians lost about Two hundred Men in the Siege: Moro∣sini immediately caused the principal Mosch to be Blessed, in which Te Deum was sung, and dedicated to St. Saviour, because it was the 6th of August, on which day is the Feast of the Trasfiguration, when the Turks hung out the white Flag of Surrender. The Command of the Place was given to Loren∣zo Venier, a noble Venetian, one of whose Ancestors was Commander in chief of the Venetian Army, when Selimus was entirely defeated at the Battle of Lepanto. The Fortifications of Santa Maura being repaired, and a Garison left in it; General Morosini set Sail to the Port of Petula, and thence to the Port of Dragonetta, where he cast Anchor, and landed his Army, which consisted of Two thousand Venetians, about One thousand of the Pope's Auxiliaries, and about Fifteen, or Sixteen hundred Greeks. This Army advanced on the Plains; upon approach of which, several Turkish Troops, which were employed to defend Passages, re∣tired without any Resistance, which gave opportunity to the Christians to Burn four or five Villages; which having done, they returned to the Fleet and re-embarked them∣selves. At the same time General Morosini with his Gally got sight of Patras and Le∣panto; and thence Sailing to the Port of Damata, a Council of War was called, and there it was resolved to Attack Preveza, without which Santa Maura could not be secured: Preveza is a Fortress which now stands in the place of the ancient Nicopolis of Epirus, the Situation of which is very Commodious, for it Commands the entrance into the Gulf, and was anciently the Royal City of Pyrrhus. This Enterprize being re∣solved, General Morosini dispeeded five Gal∣lies and six Galleasses to approach the Ca∣stles of the Gomenizze, which being discern∣ed by the Turks from Preveza, they sent back those Soldiers which they had lately drawn from thence, on supposition that the Venetians would make all their Attempt upon Preveza; which happened according to the Desire and Intention of Morosini, whose Aim it was to divide their Forces. The Army in the mean time having left Damata, came to an Anchor on the 20th of September, at the entrance into the Gulf; and the next day Captain Manetta, with Twenty four Barks, and some Brigantines,Preveza at∣tacked. entring the Gulf, landed part of his Forces; which the Turks in vain endeavoured to hinder by great and small Shot; and next Morning, by break of Day, the Gallies (which had anchored under the Hill of Ma∣homet Effendi) appeared within Musquet-shot of the Place, which gave a Diversion to the Turks, who having drawn all their Forces to that side, gave opportunity to the Christian Forces to land on the other without much Annoyance, under the Conduct of General Strazoldo, which Errour, so soon as the Turks discovered, Shaban Pasha the Gover∣nour immediately ordered Five hundred Spahees to ride full speed to Attack the For∣ces before they were landed; but before they could come, they found the Christians already drawn up in Battalia, upon whom having made some slight Charge, they retreat∣ed again in disorder with the loss of several of their Men. Thus did the Christians advance, without much difficulty, and make themselves Ma∣sters of the Out-town, and of the Hill of Mahomet Effendi, which Commands the Ci∣ty; and at the same time the Gallies and Galliots approached yet nearer to Preveza, when Morosini thought it seasonable to Sum∣mon the Town, letting them know, that in case they deferred the Surrender, until the last extremity, he would grant no Quarter, nor any Conditions whatsoever: But the Officer who commanded in chief under Sha∣ban Aga, (who was gone to head Four thousand Men without the Town, and ob∣serve the Motions of the Enemy) refused to read or receive the Letter, but barbarous∣ly shot the Messenger who brought it, ha∣ving a Confidence the Governour, whose De∣puty he was, would speedily return and raise the Siege. Whereupon Morosini having viewed the Posts and Situation of the Place, caused his Cannon and Bombs to be landed, and raised his Batteries, which played with so good Success, that several parts of the Town were fired, and most of the Enemies Guns dismounted; and those which remain∣ed on their Carriages were so ill managed, that they did little or no Execution, for there was as yet of the Christians but one Soldier killed, and five wounded. The Breach by this time was found very consi∣derable, and on the 28th a Lodgment was made in the Ditch, and a Mine being ready to be Sprung, Orders were given to pre∣pare for an Assault; which the Turks fear∣ing to expect, hung out a white Flag, and offered to capitulate, and to accept the same Conditions, which were given to Santa Maura; But at length it was concluded,
that Thirty only of the most considerable per∣sons amongst them, might march out with their Arms and Baggage, and the rest without Arms, and with no more than they could carry about them; and that all the Christi∣an Slaves should be set at Liberty. Accord∣ingly the Day following the Turks to the number of Two hundred Men marched out at the Gate towards the Sea;Preveza Surrender∣ed. and were Em∣barked on some Grecian Boats with a Con∣voy, and were Landed within four Miles of Larta, about Two hundred of the Inhabitants remaining in the place. The Town being taken the Standard of St. Mark was set up on the Walls, and all the Turkish Colours and Ban∣ners taken down, and sent to the Admiral Gally. In the Town were found Forty six Pieces of Cannon, Eighteen of which were Brass, and carried Fifty five pounds of Ball. The place was well Stored with all sorts of Provision, and with Musquets and Bullets, and Six hundred Quintals of Powder. This Town was very beneficial to the Venetians, for it put them into an entire Possession and Dominion of the Gulf, and the places of that Coast, the Fishing Trade whereof is so considerable, that it yielded to the Turks a Thousand Crowns every year arising on the Customs thereof. The Auxi∣liary and Venetian Forces re∣turn to their Win¦ter quar∣ters.Thus ended this Campagne to the Ho∣nour and Reputation of the Venetian Arms: And the Auxiliary Gallies and Forces re∣turned home, having been more diminished by Fatigues, and making Incursions into the Land, than by slaughter or loss sustain'd from the Enemy. The Venetians took their Winter-quarters in several Isles belonging to the Republick. Molino, Captain extra∣ordinary of the Ships, brought back his Squadron to Corfu; but General Morosini wintered at Preveza, with design to render that place impregnable, and to engage the Greeks, who are a People of an unconstant Humour, to remain steady in that Duty and Faith, which they caused them to Swear to the Venetian Republick; whilst these things were carrying on, some matters of less moment were acted in lighter Skirmishes near Clissa, from whence the Turks carried away seven Prisoners; but being pursued by the Morlaques, they were again rescued by them, and forced to quit their whole Booty, with the loss of Fifty of their Men killed on the place. Seignior Antonio Zeno, Proveditor extraordinary of Cataro came to Perasto, and pillaged, and burnt all the Towns and Villages near Castel Nuovo, and hinder'd the Turks from carrying in their Harvest, and seized great Stores of Wheat, and other Corn which he carried to Clissa. To compleat the Successes of this year a Galliot of Dulcigno was taken, Com∣manded by Solyman Reis a famous Corsaire: In the Fight Solyman himself with Twenty of Men was killed, and Twenty two Chri∣stians were Released and set at Liberty, whom this Pyrate was carrying into Slavery. And now having given a Relation of the Venetian Successes of this year, it will be time to return to the German Camp, which we left at the Siege before Buda. The Siege, as we have said, being com∣pleatly formed, on the 12th of July a Mine was sprung near the great Tower, which thô it had done great effect, yet it plainly appeared, That the Turks were too strong as yet in the Town to be assaulted at the entrance of any Breach, until such time as their numbers were more diminished by a longer Siege.The Vizier of Buda slain. He is suc∣ceeded by Shitan I∣brahim. On the 14th the Vi∣zier of Buda, called Kara Mahomet, died of a Wound, which he had received on his Face; he was one of the best Officers a∣mongst the Turks. Shitan Ibrahim succeed∣ed him in the Government: He was a Person very well known to the English Nation, which had lived in Turky, to which he bore a signal kindness and respect, and particularly to that worthy Person Sir Jo∣nathan Dawes, with whom he cultivated a Friendship, which was extraordinary and unsual for a Turk towards a Christian. When I came first into Turky he was then Tefter∣dar, or Lord Tresurer; whom I have seen when he was giving out the Pay to the Army to bestow Mony on the Earl of Winchelsea's Pages and Servants, who being then Lord Ambassadour Extraordinary to the Grand Seignior, was returning from an Audience which he had had with the Grand Vizier: He was afterwards Married to the Grand Seig∣nior's Sister, and was sent Pasha to Gran Ca∣ro, which is an Office of the highest Degree amongst the Turks; having remained three years in that Employment, which is the usual time allowed to that Government, he was then recalled, and taxed at Six hundred Purses of Money; he was forced to lay down one half in ready Money, and to pay the other Moiety in a few Days after∣wards, upon Penalty of being committed to a Prison, from whence he had never been delivered but by Death.The Cha∣racter of Shitan Ibrahim. He was after∣wards made Pasha of Damascus, then of Aleppo, and with his Forces was engaged to pass by Sea to the Siege at Candia. I remember him at Smyrna, when he embark∣ed there, and then he told me, how grie∣vous it was for him and his Men to leave their Horses, (than which nothing was more pleasing and dear) and to Embark on a Gally, and pass the Seas to which he and his Soldiers had never been accustomed. Afterwards he was employed in many great Offices, to which he had been bred from
his Youth, and in which he had deported himself with singular Reputation and Esteem, being naturally of a frank and a generous Temper: He was then about Eighty years of Age, and nothing declined, but still as Robust and Vigorous as if he were but Forty, when he defended Buda, and suc∣ceeded the Pasha who was killed on the Walls; and in this Condition we shall leave him for a year or two, until being involved in the Common Fate and Misfor∣tunes of the Turks, he yielded to the De∣stiny which was provided for him. Sallies from the Town.On the 16th of August the Besieged made a Sally, and were beaten back with some loss; but the next day they had better For∣tune, and killed many of the Christians, as they did also in several other Sallies. But to encourage the Christians in this Siege, several Deserters escaped out of the Town, and to flatter the Party into whose Hands they were fallen, they told a thousand Falsi∣ties concerning the distresses and wants of the Town. But notwithstanding all their Reports, it was concluded necessary, to open the Breach in the Wall of Buda much wider than it was before; to which end the Cannon plaid continually upon that part of the Town, where the Assault was to be made. But in the mean time to disturb these proceedings, the Seraskier Pasha with all the Force of the Ottoman Army, appear∣ed often times in sight of the Camp, which gave such frequent Allarums, that the Duke of Loraine thought fit to draw out a great part of his Army to engage them, leaving all the left Wing in the Approaches, under Command of Count Staremberg, Ge∣neral of the Artillery, and with the remain∣der of the Infantry, and all the Cavalry he marched between the upper City, and Mount St. Gerard, to meet the Seraskier; and so soon as the Way opened into the Vally between Buda and Strigonium, he discover'd a great Body of Turkish Horse upon a Hill opposite to the Army, upon view of which the Christian Army drew into Battalia;A Fight before Bu∣da. and thô the way to an En∣gagement with the Enemy was rough, crag∣gy and very steep; yet such was the Spirit, which by frequent Victories had possessed the Christian Soldiery, that with incompa∣rable Valour, their right Wing moved over all the difficulties of the Ground against the left Wing of the Turks; but they fear∣ing to stand the Shock, made their Re∣treat to another Hill within Cannon-shot of Buda, where their right Wing was drawn up: The Imperial Troops still continuing to advance against the Enemy, detached Two thousand of their choice Horse, who making as if they intended to form ano∣ther Line before the Front; posted them∣selves under the Walls of the City; during which time the main Body of the Turks stood firm, and kept their Ground, until the Christians were come within Musquet-shot; and then their formost Troops fell violently into the Trenches on the right Hand,A Sally from the Town. whilst a Sally was made out of the City by the Janisaries on the left: And so Fu∣rious was the Charge they made, that they gained the first Post, which was maintain'd by Count Furstemburg, Captain the Regi∣ment of Grana, and passed to the second Guard, defended by a Captain of the Regi∣ment of Baden, and proceeded even to the third Post under one of the Batteries. But Count Aspremont, and Colonel Bek, with two Battalions coming to their assistance, as did also the Battalions of reserve under Staremberg and Souches, the Enemy was so vigorously repulsed by them, that they not only recovered the several Posts which they had lost, but gained a Fort from the Enemy, which was Situated on the Danube, and took four Standards from them, with the Slaughter of many Janisaries. At the same time the Enemies left Wing of Horse was so warmly charged by the Im∣perialists, that they were put into a disor∣derly Flight, and run over and trampled down their Foot; howsoever Rallying a∣gain they made a stand, as if they had intended to renew the Fight: But observing the right Wing of the Christians to advance towards them, and the left Wing to come into their assistance, they durst not adven∣ture to stand the Shock, but fled in full Career; but such as were worse mounted, and trusted not to the Swifness of their Horses, in a desperate manner made their way into the City for Refuge. This en∣terprise of the Turks cost the Christians Three hundred Men; those of Qualitie killed were the Counts of Fustemberg and Carlovitz, and the Counts Guido Staremberg, and Scalemberg were wounded, for which the Turks paid most dearly, leaving Seven thousand of their Companions slain upon the place. The Seraskier,An Assault on lower Buda. and his Army being thus repulsed with great slaughter and much dis∣mayed; the Duke of Loraine resolved to attempt the lower Town by, the Breach which was made: The which was accor∣dingly executed by the Baron of Asti, who in despight of the Granadoes, and continu∣al Vollies of the Musquets surmounted the Ruins, and took possession of the Breach; and being seconded by other Forces, he proceeded and made himself Master of the more inward Retrenchments, destroying the Palisadoes and the Works in such man∣ner, that the Defendants had no other Shel∣ter than their Houses remaining to them.
By this time Count Tulli and a Captain of the Regiment of Mansfield were come to their assistance, and together with Asti ad∣vanced to the Gate which opens to the Danube; where after a sharp Fight, with much effusion of Blood on both sides, they forced open the Gate, and gave entrance to Colonel Culemfels with Five hundred Men, who being also followed by great numbers of Hayducks, they so overwhelmed the the Turks with their power,The lower Buda and Castle ta∣ken. that they fled for refuge to the Castle: But being closely pursued by the Christians, who were now mixed with them, those in the Castle feared to open their Gates, lest by giving entrance to their Friends they should receive their Ene∣mies; so that as many as were excluded out of the Castle fell by the German Sword; others betaking themselves to their Houses, barred their Doors, and hid themselves in Vaults and Cellars: But there being no protecti∣on for the miserable, Fire was applyed to the Houses, whereby those who had esca∣ped the Sword, perished in the Flames. In this Glorious Action it is said, That 12.000 Janisaries were Slain, with the loss only of Seventy five or Eighty Christians killed and wounded; after which the sever∣al Posts, and Gates of the Town were well secured; and Orders given to Attack the Palanca and Castle of St. Gerards; which at the first sight, and appearance only of an Attempt, the Defendants abandoned, carrying away with them all their Cannon and Ammunition. The lower Town being thus subdued and possessed by the Christians, the very same Night Batteries were raised on St. Gerard's Mount, and Trenches and Approaches made on that side, whereby the upper City of Buda was more closely Besieged, and the Enemy reduced within a more narrow Compass. Whilst these mat∣ters were Acting, Count Lesly with a Body of Fifteen thousand Men, made an At∣tempt upon the City and Castle of Virovitz, which is in Sclavonia, Situated on the Fron∣tiers of Croatia, and is sometimes called Berseck. To Succour this place the Seras∣kier caused several Troops to advance, who encountring a Detachment of Eight hun∣dred Croats, they put them into Disorder, and caused them to Retreat unto their main Body, with the loss of three of their Stan∣dards; but pursuing them too far, their Career was stopt by the Army of Lesly,Two parties of Turks Defeated. who vigorously repulsed them, and put them to Flight with the loss of Five hundred of their Men, and Two hundred killed on the side of the Christians. This good Success was seconded by another happy Encounter which Count Trotmansdorf, with a Party of Four thousand Croats, had over a Party of Two thousand Turks, designed by the Pasha of Marotz (who was appointed to Guard the Bridge of Esseck) to Succour the Town and Castle of Virovitz; for they were all defeated by him, as was also ano∣ther Party of Fifteen hundred Horse, who were marching with all diligence to joyn with the Two thousand lately routed and dispersed. Thus the Town and Castle ha∣ving lost all their hopes of Succour and Relief, they spread a white Flag on the Walls, which demonstrated their intenti∣ons to Capitulate.Viovitz Surrendred. Accordingly a Treaty being had, several particulars were agreed, and the places Surender'd: The Turkish Garrison, which consisted of about One thousand Soldiers, were permitted to march forth without their Arms, unless Fifteen of the principal Officers, who had liberty to go forth with their Horses and Arms; the rest were to have no more than what they could carry on their Backs. The Turks having quitted the City and Castle, the Christians supplied it with a Garrison of Two hun∣dred Men, under the Command of the Ba∣ron of Schelardt. The News of the loss of Virovitz, put all the Country thereabouts into such Consternation, that several places were abandoned by the Turks, and a way opened to General Lesly to march without any impediment to the Bridge of Esseck. In the mean time the Approaches, and Works before Buda proceeded with infinite diligence and labour, so that by the 26th Day of July, they were advanced within Sixty Paces of the Counterscarp:The Procee∣dings at the Siege of Buda. Likewise other Batteries were raised of Twenty five Pieces of great Cannon, and Twelve Mor∣tar-pieces, which fired continually; and on the side of Pest, they annoied the Turks with long Guns, and small Pieces of Ord∣nance, that they were not able to approach near the River for Water, of which there was great scarcity and want in the Town. The Batteries not doing the Execution which was expected, by Reason that the Walls were filled with Earth, endeavours were made to Under-mine a corner of the Counterscarp; and on that side towards Strigonium to advance the Works within Sixty Paces of the Tower:The ill Con∣dition of the Besie∣gers. In which At∣tempts One hundred and twenty six Germans were killed in one day and night. Within the Town they were industrious and brave, every Janisary behaving himself, with Resolution and indefatigable Labour: And on the other side, Without the Town the Soldiers were harassed, and tyred with continual Watchings and Pains; and the Pioneers and Labourers working beyond their strengh, in the ex∣cessive heats fell into Malignant Fevers, and Diseases of the Camp, by which the numbers of those People being greatly diminished, the Mines and Works advanced very slowly.
On that side towards Strigonium, the im∣pediments and hindrances were as great, as on the other; for the Defendants continu∣ally Fired upon the Labourers, which ob∣structed them in such manner, that it was impossible to joyn their Trenches to the Wall of the Bastion which Flanked the Cur∣tain; and such showers of Granadoes, and Vollies of small Shot were thrown amongst them, that they were forced to desist from their Work, and to proceed by Mining the Earth, which required much time, and re∣tarded the Conquest of the place. On the 30th of August, about Sun-rising the Turks made a Furious Sally into the Trenches of the Germans, causing them to Fly, with the loss of Forty or Fifty Men; but other Troops coming to their Succour, they were forced to Retire in much Confu∣sion and Disorder, and endeavouring an Es∣cape by the Breaches in the Walls, and nar∣row Avenues, they exposed themselves to the Swords and Fire Arms of their Enemies, who destroyed them with great Slaughter. Sept.At the beginning of September, the Rains fell in such abundance, that the Soldiers in some of the Trenches remain'd a whole Day up to the middle in Water, which in∣creased the Diseases of the Camp, from which some of the Commanders were not freed; and particularly the Duke of Loraine, who became so indisposed in his Health, that he was constrained to Retire unto Old Buda for ease and remdy, where he continued not above four or five Days, before he returned again to the Camp; during this time the Turks made other Sallies upon the Christi∣ans,Sallies from the Town. for several Days, to their great loss and discouragement; for besides Three hun∣dred Common Soldiers, many principal Officers were killed and wounded; amongst which those of chief Note were the Mar∣quis Cavalieri, Lieutenant Colonel of the Regiment of Gran, Count Tirheim a Cap∣tain of the Regiment of Baden were slain, and Major General Schaffemberg, and the Marquis of Parella, with several other Of∣ficers were wounded. But to suport the Spirits of the Christians, which were not a little dismayed by these losses, and the great difficulties which were yet to be overcome; the Bavarian Infantry fortunately came to their Succours, (thô those of Franconia were Countermanded) which so enlivened, and cheared up the Hearts of the drooping Camp, That the Duke of Loraine sent a menacing Message to the Governour of Buda,Summons sent to the Town. giving him to understand, that in case he stood out longer and refused to sur∣render, until he was forced thereunto by a General Assault, which he was preparing to make, that then he would put all to the Sword, giving Quarter to none, nor sparing Age nor Sex: To which Summons he re∣turned this answer, That in such Case he would neither demand Mercy,The Vizie's Answer. or Quarter for his own Person, nor for any of the Sol∣diers, or Inhabitants of that place: And on the other side he declared, That he would give no Quarter to the Besiegers, but when they fell into his Hands, would treat them with the same usage, which was threatned unto them: And to shew how much he was in earnest, he caused Forty Christian Prisoners to be brought before him on the Walls, and in Presence of the Person who brought the Summons, he commanded them all to be put to Death; saying,His Cruel∣ty. That if it were in his Power to Massacre the whole Christian Army, he would do it with as little Remorse, as he executed his present Rage on those miserable Wretches: And it being farther told this Vizier, that the Duke of Bavaria had in Person, and with 30.000 Men reinforced the Army which encompas∣sed the City: He made answer, That he knew very well what a Petty King of Ger∣many meant, and that his Three thousand Men which he had brought with him, could not terrify him who commanded a Place, where the Soldiers were many and brave, and where was no want of Ammunition and Provisions. On the 8th, The Christians Sprang a Mine under one of the Towers, where the Turks had placed their principal Battery; and at Night Sprang three or four more under the Curtain, but not with so good effect as was expected: Howsoever, they had brought their Attacks to the very Ditches of the Town and Castle, and had made a Lodg∣ment upon one of the Breaches. On the 9th and 10th, Several other Mines were fired with such Success, that they overthrew a great part of the Wall, and opened so wide a space, that four or five Carts might enter a-breast: Howsoe∣ver, it was not thought advisable to make an Assault, by Reason that the Defendants had formed several Retrenchments within, and guarded them with many Troops and Batteries: And besides, the Infantry were so weakned by Dissenteries, and other Sick∣nesses, that it was not thought fit to hazard them upon so desperate an Attempt. How∣soever, having fired a Mine at Kulakupee with good effect,The Chri∣stians make an Assault and are repulsed. they seconded it with a furious Assault, but were again repulsed with much loss, and great slaughter of the common Soldiers; and the Counts of Ha∣rach and Nassau, and the Major of the Re∣giment of Mansfeldt were all killed; and the Counts of Staremberg and Aversberg were amongst the number of the wounded. Amongst these Disorders and Discourage∣ments, five Christians found means to make
their Escape out of the Town, and inform∣ed the General, that the Turks had raised two Batteries each of five Pieces of Cannon upon a Horn-work which was palisadoed, and was guarded by another Tower behind this Work, and joyned to a more inward Wall made of Earth above nine Foot thick: That there was also a Ditch and Palisadoes behind the Breach, and that there were still 20.000 Men within the Town, who were capable to bear Arms; and that the princi∣pal Officers upon hopes of being relieved by the Seraskier (as was assured them by some Soldiers lately come from Belgrade, and the Bridge of Esseck) had resolved to main∣tain the Town to the last and utmost Ex∣tremity: Howsoever that there was some division amongst them; for thô the Inhabi∣tants seem'd resolute to stand out unto the last drop of their Blouds, fearing lest they should be treated like the Garrison of Virovitza, yet the Janisaries (who had no other Concerment in the Place, than their own Lives) protested that in case they were not speedily relieved by the Seraskier, they would constrain the Governour to surrender upon Capitulations. If the Garrison of Buda were in a bad Condition, the Imperial Camp in the Lea∣guer was not in a much better; for most of the Officers were either killed,The ill Con∣dition of the Lea∣guer. sick or wounded; and such was the scarcity of all Provisions, caused by the Obstructions which the Seraskier had laid in the way to inter∣cept the Convoys, which fetched them from far distant Places, that the proportion of Meat, and weight of Bread, distributed to every Soldier, was much diminish'd; so that the Siege had then been raised had not the Duke of Bavaria (as we have said) come to the Camp on the 9th of September, with his Infantry, which gave new Hopes and Encouragement to continue the Siege; thô the Death of General Dunewaldt in his Tent, who had the Reputation of a valiant and an experienced Soldier, did very much add to the Sorrow and Discouragement of the Camp. Still did the Turks continue to make their Sallies with much Bravery, in one of which they spiked or nailed three Pieces of Can∣non.Sallies made by the Turks. The Prince of Saxony Eisenach had his Leg taken off with a great Shot, and General Kops fighting valiantly at the Head of his Men was wounded, and died shortly afterwards in his Tent. But it was very observable, how Forty stout Turks, naked to the Wast, behaved themselves with two-handed broad Swords, hewing and cutting down all before them; they advanced as far as to the River-side, and having covered the Ground with dead Bodies, they return∣ed with the loss of few of their number in∣to the Town. The Reinforcement which the Duke of Bavaria brought to the Christian Camp, put the Turks into an Apprehension that the Town would certainly be taken, unless it were relieved by some signal Success of the Seraskier's Army within the Lines of the Christians; which the Turks speedily design∣ed so soon as they were reinforced by some Troops, which were daily expected. Af∣ter some time, the Seraskier received a Let∣ter from the Grand Vizier, that it was im∣possible for him to send any considerable Recruits;The Vizier's Orders to the Sera∣skier. having been obliged to dispeed such Troops, as were with him, to the Dar∣danelles, Tenedos and Morea, to prevent the Landing of the Venetian Army, which had already made themselves Masters of Santa Maura. And that therefore he should sup∣ply the want of numbers by his extraordina∣ry Vigilance and Art, and to hazard every thing rather than suffer Buda to fall into the Hands of the Enemy. The Seraskier ac∣cordingly marched with about 25.000 Men, or at most 27.000 to Alba Regalis, and en∣camped before the Town, with intention very speedily to disturb the Siege; but hearing that the Duke of Bavaria was come thither with a very considerable Force, he altered his Design, and marched towards the Bridge of Esseck, to fight those Troops which were sent thither under the Command of Count Erdedi, the General of Croatia, and to hinder them from burning the Bridge, or taking the Forts which covered it. Count Leslie in the mean time followed the Sera∣skier to observe his Motion, and assist Erde∣di;The Duke of Loraine Marches af∣ter the Se∣raskier. which the Duke of Loraine conceiving not of Force sufficient to oppose themselves against the whole Turkish Army; he recal∣led all his Cavalry from the Frontier Towns, and those which blocked up Newhausel, and with three Regiments of Foot lately come from Moravia, and some of the Bava∣rian Forces, he departed from the Camp on the 16th, with resolution to Engage the Seraskier, leaving the whole Conduct of the Siege to the Elector of Bavaria. But the Seraskier fearing to hazard the whole Affair on the fortune of a Battle, retired under the Cannon of Alba Regalis. Whereupon five Regiments of Horse, and a Thousand Foot, were ordered to Post and Forrify themselves on certain Hills, by which the Turkish Army was necessarily to pass, and could not move without being observed by them. In the mean the Batteries,The Bavari∣ans ad∣vance their Works. which the Ba∣varians had raised, had begun to open a wide Breach; and on that side by the Wa∣ter, their Works were advanced one third in length of the lower Town; and several Redoubts were perfected to impede and di∣sturb the Seraskier in his March from Alba
Regalis, towards the Siege of Buda: The Expectations were great of the coming of the Bavarian Horse, and other Cavalry from the parts near Presburg, under the Command of Count Caraffa, and also of the Swedish Infantry, which were now much wanted at this Siege. The Rains which fell in such great abun∣dance on the 18th at Night, did greatly retard the progress of the Works which the Bavarians were making, thô their Batteries had good effect upon that Angle, which was contiguous to the Tower on the Ca∣stle side; but the Approaches appeared dai∣ly more difficult than before, and the Works on the River-side proceeded slowly, and on the side of the Curtain, the Miners were not able to advance above three Pikes in length. The Duke of Loraine being returned to the Camp, the Bavarians who had the At∣tack by the River-side, sprang a Mine un∣der the Tower with so good Success, that it overthrew a great part of the Wall, with one of the Gates: They also made a Line of Communication, which joyned their At∣tack with that of Count Maximilian de Sta∣remberg: The Defendants at the same time made several Attempts to enter the Lines of Bavarians, but could not prevail, by reason that the Entrance was strongly fortify'd; and farther, to defend themselves, they made several Retrenchments within the Town, and pulled down several Houses, covered the Streets with Beams to cast off Granadoes, and hinder the Bombs from do∣ing hurt and damage to the Houses. The 20th of this Month the Defendants had the good fortune to seize a Boat laden with Provisions,The Besieg∣ed take a Boat with Provisions. as it was going to the Imperial Camp, which caused much Joy in the City, whereby the Report which some Fugitives made of the scarcity and want of Provisions in the Place, was clearly confirmed: And the same day a Party of Fifteen hundred Turks attacked some Foragers sent from the Leaguer, of whom they killed several, and took some Prisoners, with the laden Wag∣gons, the rest making their Escape as well as they could. In fine, the Seraskier being resolved once more to attempt the Relief of Buda, raised his Camp on the 21st from under the Walls of Alba Regalis, and began his March; of which the Duke of Loraine having Advice by a Polonian,The Sera∣skier en∣deavours to raise the Siege. who was escaped out of the Hands of the Turks, immediately drew out his Forces into the appointed Places, and with such Order, as was lately agreed at a Council of War, where they attended all day for the coming of the Enemy; which not appearing, the Forces drew off towards the Evening into their several Quarters, ha∣ving been greatly incommoded by the Rains, which had continued all that day to fall in such abundance. Howsoever, the day fol∣lowing, Two thousand Turks attacked the Lines in two places with much Resolution, endeavouring to force their Passage into the Town; but finding great Resistance,A Sally ou of the Town. they were beaten off with considerable loss, lea∣ving two Standards in the Hands of the Imperialists. Whilst this Attack was made, Fifteen Hundred Horse and Foot made a Sally out of the Town, and cleared all the Trenches before them, and advanced to the very Batteries, killing about Two hundred Men; but some Squadrons coming to their Relief, forced them back with the loss of Four hundred Men. The Seraskier, who was retreated to his Camp about two Leagues distant from the Siege, kept the Christians in a continual Alarum, and on the 23d made as if he would have attempted the Lines once more; but the Mettle of the Turks was not so warm and hot as formerly; howsoever, Four hundred of their Men wading over a marshy Ground, up to the Armpits in Mire and Water, found a Way, which before that time, was esteemed unpassable; and got in∣to the Town, except some few, who, stick∣ing in the Mire, were birded off and killed with Musquet-shot. By this time the Bavarian Troops being come, with three German Regiments from Bohemia, the Duke of Loraine esteemed himself in a Condition able to engage the Turkish Army, and so marching out of the Lines with a considerable Body, he follow∣ed the Enemy, and provoked them to a Battle; but the Seraskier having already performed his Design, by putting some Men into the Town, he declined the Fight, so that the Duke of Loraine without other Action returned again to the Siege; but before they entred the Lines, the Garrison made a desperate Sally both with Horse and Foot, and with such Success, that they drove the Besiegers out of their Trenches, filled up some of their Works with Earth, levelled one of their Batteries,A Sally out of the Towe. and killed above Three hundred Men upon the Place; and after having routed the Bavarians, they fell in upon the Quarters of the Imperia∣lists, who being less harassed than the o∣thers, gave them a Repulse with equal loss. On the 25th the Seraskier appeared a third time in sight of the Leaguer, shewing as if he intended to offer Battle; upon ap∣pearance of which, the Christians drew out of their Lines; but whilst they were rang∣ing themselves into a posture of Battle, a Detachment of Four thousand Horse were dispeeded under covert of the Hills, and
before they were discovered, assailed a Quar∣ter of the Imperialists, which was defen∣ded only by two Regiments of Horse, and two Battalions of Foot, whom charging by Surprise,A Defeat given the Christians. they totally defeated, and killed above a thousand Men, amongst which were Count Tilly and several other Officers of Note. During this Consternation in the Christian Camp, a Thousand Turks sheltring themselves under the shadow of the Hills, found a Passage into the Town. The Elector of Bavaria, and the Duke of Loraine being much heated and incensed with these Successes of the Enemy, resolved with some Hungarian and Polonian Horse, and some Regiments of Foot, to Attack the Turks in their Camp;The Sera∣skier re∣tires. but the Seraskier ha∣ving done his Business by sending Relief and Recruits into the Town, retired under the Cannon of Alba Regalis, and there fortified himself so well, having a moorish or fenny Ground before him, that it was impossible to force his Camp, or hinder the Alarums which several Parties detached from the Turkish Army, appearing sometime on the Hills, and then again in sight of the Leaguer, did daily give them, and disturbed much the proceeding of the Mines and other Works.The Diffi∣culties of the Siege. The Town it self was raised in an advanta∣geous Situation; the Walls were so strong, and filled with Earth, that notwithstanding the many Batteries, they could not make a Breach wide enough for four Men to enter a-breast; nor could it well be expected, that they should be starved or constrained by Famine to make a Surrender, during the short remainder of this Year's Season; for indeed this Governour of the Town, had so well husbanded the Provisions, that there was no scarcity as yet of any thing necessary for Human Sustenance; and be∣sides, the Defendants had some times the fortune to seize certain Boats laden with Provisions, designed for the Christian Camp; for it was not possible wholly to debar them from all Communication with the River: Wherefore there seemed no other way left to win the Town, but by a vigorous As∣sault, the which also had so much difficulty and hazard in it, that it seemed neither prudent nor reasonable to be lavish of the Lives of Men, in an Attempt so desperate, that there seemed little or no hope of the Success thereof. The Garrison within, not∣withstanding their frequent Slaughters con∣sisted of Ten thousand Janisaries and o∣thers, all resolute and approved Men, as had been evidenced by many Proofs:The ill Con∣dition of the Chri∣stian Camp. On the other side, the Imperial Army was greatly diminished; the Horses for the most part were dead, or unfit for Service for want of Forage; all the Troops were harassed, weak and sickly; the Duke of Loraine him∣self ill disposed in his Health, and in dan∣ger of a Relapse; the best Officers for the most part were either killed or wounded; so that considering all these Matters toge∣ther, it was not to be expected that the Siege could long continue; besides all which the Rains fell in such extream abundance, that the Trenches were filled with Water, and all the Mines and Works ruined and destroyed. Howsoever the Bavarians being but lately come, and not so much harassed as the other Soldiers, on the 24th at Night advanced their Post near to the Wall at the Foot of the Castle-ditch. On the same day a Body of Two thousand of the Enemy appear∣ed in sight of the Leaguer; who, thô they reti∣red again without any Action, yet they caused an Alarum in the Camp, and several Troops were drawn out against them, which made a Diversion, and retarded the Pro∣ceedings which were advancing against the Town. The Bavarians being the most active of any, had made a Breach in the Wall near the Castle, which they stormed, and made themselves Masters of a Redoubt or Bulwark on the Wall; but the Turks being very strong on that side, gave them not sufficient time to shelter and ward themselves, but forced them to dislodge with the loss of Three hundred Men. On the 2d of October a Battery of Sixteen Pieces of Cannon of Twenty six Pound Bul∣let, on the side of the Imperialists,Octob. had en∣tirely razed and beaten down a little Tower belonging to the Castle, and next day they endeavoured with Four thousand Men to make a descent into the Ditch, and possess the Breach; but the Turks having with great industry and diligence Repaired it again with Earth, Faggots and Palisadoes,The Chri∣stians re∣ceive a great Loss. defen∣ded it with such vigorous Resistance, that after a most bloudy and desperate Fight the Christians were droven thence with the loss of Fifteen hundred Men, amongst which was a Major, and several Captains and Of∣ficers belonging to the Bavarian Troops. Howsoever the Imperialists and Bavarians not being dismayed with all these Losses, continued to advance their Works at the Gate towards the River, and to make their Batteries on the Breach, which as yet, was not wide enough for two Men to pass a∣breast; but being a little more opened, the Ba∣varians stormed it for the space of five Hours; and thô they were several times repulsed, yet they lodged themselves on part of the Breach, from whence they discovered a Fort-Royal with four Bastions, which the Turks had built in the middle of the Town,A Saelly from the Town upon the Bavari∣ans. with intent to fly thither for Sanctuary, in case of the last Extremity; but that Hour was not yet come; for the Defendants, anima∣ted
with their late Successes, made another Sally on the 14th instant with such numbers, that they dislodged the Bavarians from the Breach, drove them out of their Trenches, filled up part of their Works, and killed Two hundred of their Men; to Succour which the Elector coming himself in Person, repulsed the Enemy with a great Slaugh∣ter, and caused his Soldiers and Labourers to open their Works again, and repair to their former Stations. The Miners still continued to Labour, but received consi∣derable impediments by Springs of Water, which overflowed their Works. The Seraskier kept the Christian Camp in a continual Alarum until the Raising of the Siege: And whensoever he came so near as to engage with the Enemy, the De∣fendants at the same time Sallied from the Town, and retired again with different Succes∣ses, sometimes with advantage and at other times with loss. On the 24th, a general Alarum was given over all the Camp,Alarums given. that the Seraskier with all his Cavalry, and Eight thousand Janisaries drawn out from Alba Regalis and other parts, and Fifteen Pieces of Artillery, was come within two Leagues of the Lines; upon which Report all the German Cavalry mounted on Horse-back, and drew themselves up into a Posture of Defence; but it proved a false Alarum, and served only to increase the Fatigues and wearisomness of the Soldiery. As the Spi∣rits of the Besiegers were Drooping and Fainting without, so the many Successes of those within, filled them full of hopes of a speedy delivery; for they had lately taken so many Boats laden with Provisions design∣ed for the Christian Camp, that their wants of necessary Sustenance were supplyed. And on the 29th, Some Deserters from the Christian Camp discover'd to them several Mines which were preparing against them, by which intimation they opened the Earth, found and disarmed them of their Powder, which was so great a disappoint∣ment and discouragement to the Christians, that it was esteemed by the most experien∣ced Commanders almost impossible to gain the Town,The diffi∣culties of gaining the Town. in regard the Season of the Year was spent, and the Winter already enter'd. In Consideration of which, the Duke of Loraine assembled a Council of War to de∣liberate concerning the Resolutions, which were to be taken in the present Exigency and Conjuncture of Affairs: At which time Prince Erman of Baden, President of the Council of War at Vienna, arrived in the Camp, having been dispatched by the Em∣peror, with Commission to Command the German Infantry, during the Sickness of the two Counts of Staremberg; and with In∣structions and Orders also to the Duke of Loraine to raise the Siege, in case there was not a certainty, or at least some probable hopes of reducing the Town in a very short term of time; for that his Imperial Majesty desired not to consume his Forces in a de∣sperate and fruitless Enterprise. The arri∣val of this Prince was very seasonable at this time, both for the Message he brought, as also for his ability and knowledge in War, being a wise Man and an experienced Offi∣cer:Consultati∣ons about, raising the Siege. In whose Presence matters were again taken into Consideration, and the State of the Town within, and of the Camp with∣out, was laid before the Generals and Field-Officers; some few advised to continue the Siege, until the Success was tried and seen of certain Mines, which were still forming in the Bavarian Quarters: But the greatest part, representing the ill. Condition of the Troops, the want of all necessaries in the Camp, the extremity of the Season, and the apparent hazard of a total Destruction to the whole Army, in case of a general Assault, were of Opinion, That the se∣curest way were to raise the Siege in the best order possible, for saving and securing the Army from Sallies from the Town, and Attacks by the Seraskier and his Army: But before this Point was concluded, the Duke of Loraine, the Elector of Bavaria and Prince Erman with sevetal other Chief Officers, took a Survey of all the Lines and Quarters of the Camp, and having consi∣der'd, that the Defendants were still Ten thousand strong, and well provided with Vi∣ctuals and Ammunition, and that it was im∣possible without greater Force to debar them from all Communication with the Danube, from which they received daily Supplies; and that the Mines in which they had pla∣ced their greatest hopes, had either been discover'd by the Enemy and disarmed, of by the inexperience of the Workmen and Ingeniers, had taken vent, and reversed without any Execution; It was then con∣cluded, and fully resolved to raise the Siege: A farther Motive whereunto were the Rains which continued to fall without intermission. In the first place therefore, the Winter-quarters were agreed and assigned by the Council, so that the Troops might know, unto what Towns they were to march; then all the Heavy Cannon, Morter-pieces and Bombs were order'd to be carried away and secur'd. On the 1st of November the Siege was raised,Nov. The Siege raised. in which the Christians had lost 25.000 Men: And now to bring off the surviving part, and to fortifie the Rear a∣gainst the Sallies of the Garrison, and de∣fend the whole Army in their march against the Seraskier, who being well informed of
their weaknesses, and loss of numbers, at∣tended their Motion, was an Action where∣in to employ the Art and Conduct of the wisest, and most experienced Captain in the World. Wherefore all imaginable care, and caution was used in drawing off; the light∣er Cannon and Field-pieces were placed so as to defend the Rear, as also the Flank and Wings; because that most of the Horse be∣ing Dead for want of Forage, the Men were forced to walk on Foot, in the Ranks of the Infantry which lay exposed, and na∣ked to the Cavalry of the Enemy. The Imperial and Auxiliary Troops, to the number of 30.000 took their march towards Gran: The heavy Artillery and Baggage, with Eight thousand sick and wounded Men, were embarked on several Boats to be carried up the River against the Stream; and such as were most Sick and Weak, were with a small Guard Transported to the Island of St. Andrews, which was designed for an Hospital to receive and Cure them: But the Tartars entring into the Island,The Tar∣tars take the Island of St. An∣drews. kil∣led above a Hundred of the wounded Men, before they could be removed, and pilla∣ged the Baggage with the Equipage of Co∣lonel Piccolomini, and so much as they could not carry away they burnt and destroied: A like Accident happned to some other Boats laden with the Bavarian Troops, which by some accident or other, being by the Winds, or breaking of their Ropes, or Cordage put on Shoar were suprized and taken by the Enemy,Ill Acci∣dents after raising the Siege. which to observe their Motion had laien concealed in the Flags and Osiers, which grew by the Banks of the Danube. Great were the Murmur∣ings and Discontents which arose upon these two unhappy Accidents, occasioned as they talked by the neglect and ill Conduct of the Officers: Nor was the Resolution of abandoning the City of Pest less approved, thô the Fortifications were demolished, the Walls and Gates Blown up, and the most considerable Bulwarks demolished: Howso∣ever, those who conceived another Opini∣on, alledged, That the Masters of the Field would be able to maintain that Fortress, in despight of the ill Neighbours on the other side: And that it would be difficult, and a great loss of Men and time to recover that place, whensoever a fairer opportunity pre∣sented to renew the Siege of Buda: Others of a contrary sense produced opposite Ar∣guments, all People blaming each other, as is usual in Sinister events, when matters succeed in an unlucky manner, different to the first conceived hopes. Winter-quarters assigned.The Duke of Loraine before he would leave the Army, saw the several Troops disposed in their respective Winter-quarters. The Imperialists were lodged in Comorra and the Parts adjacent, and as many as these places could not contain were sent to Silesia, Moravia and Bohemia. The Bava∣rians advanced into the Counties of Arva, Czepus, Lipze, Saraz and other places ap∣pointed for them. The Seraskier having information of the several Quarters, and of the Troops which were lodged in them; gathered what For∣ces he was able, to the number of 18.000 Men, with which passing the River, he Sate down before Wazia or Vualtz; a place de∣fended by Five hundred Soldiers belonging to the Regiment of Thaun, and Command∣ed by the Lieutenant Colonel only: The Fortifications were chiefly the Breasts of the Soldiers,Vuazia Attacked. there being only an old Wall in many places Ruinous, and a few weak Pa∣lifadoes unable and unfit for the least De∣fence. The Turks encouraged with these advantages, stormed the place on all sides; the Imperialists repelled their Force with Force, and defended themselves with as much Bravery, as was possible to do, with such un∣equal numbers: But finding it at length impossible, unless by Miracle, to sustain so mighty a Force, without hopes of Relief; they agreed to Capitulate, and sent Pro∣positions of Surrender: The which being accepted, and the Articles signed, the Gates were opened, with intention that the Christians might march out, and leave the Town to the Possession of the Enemy; but instead thereof the Turks rushed in, and with their drawn Cymiters killed and massa∣cred all before them: It was then to no purpose to call out, and revile them with the breach of Faith and violation of Arti∣cles, having the Seraskier's Commands not to observe them, or lend an Ear; nor did it much avail to use resistance, the Enemy being already in the midst of them; all that could be done, was to sell their Lives at the dearest rate. In fine,Five hun∣dred Chri∣stians put to the Sword. This Tragedy ended with the Slaughter and Butchery of this whole Party, which was much lamen∣ted at the Court of Vienna, as a loss of the highest concernment, that Regiment consisting of old experienced and veteran Soldiers, Men of approved Valour, and long inured to Labour and Sufferings: This Misfortune also was become the common Discourse of the Army, blaming the Officers for assign∣ing Quarters at so far distance from other Succours, which was to sacrifice the Lives of so many brave Men, without any regard to the Fury of the Enemy; and if Pest which was a Walled and well Fortified Town, and capable of making Resistance was to be Demolished and Dismantled only, because it was esteemed too far distant from Succours and Relief; how much rather should Vualts, or Vualtz have been judged
an improper and dangerous Quarter, which was but an open Town without other de∣fence, than the naked Breasts of the poor Soldiery? Thus ended this Campagne unluckily in respect to the Siege of Buda, and the Suc∣cesses which followed, thô in other Parts Fortune smiled on the Christian Arms; for General Schultz took Barsfeldt,Barsfeldt taken. Situ∣ated on the Frontiers of Poland, after a Siege of three Days, thô it be a place en∣compassed with a deep Ditch full of Water, and good Walls, and Fortified with Towers, Redoubts and Ramparts. The Garrison con∣sisted of Four hundred Men belonging to Tekeli, of which Three hundred after the Surrender took up Arms for the Empe∣ror, and One hundred which refused, were Convoyed as far as Ragowitz. Likewise Ge∣neral Schultz took the Castle of Stropko belonging to the Malecontents,And Strop∣ko. by Sur∣render upon Composition; therein were Eleven Brass Guns, with Ammunition and Provisions for War: He took also the Castle of Makovitz. Count Zober, who Com∣manded the Hungarian Troops at Neutra, Surprized the Castle at Suram, whilst the greatest part of the Garrison was gone out to seek for Forage. But these small advan∣tages made but a poor amends for greater losses; the sense whereof served to move Anger, and desire of Revenge in the gener∣ous Breasts of the Soldiery, and to quicken the Imperial Councils to make Prepara∣tions against the next Campagne: And in regard Newhausel was in the first place aimed at, as a Prize for the ensuing Year, Ge∣neral Heysler was Ordered to enlarge his Quarters in all parts round the City, that so keeping it continually Blocked up, the Conquest thereof might be render'd much more easie, at that time, when the Season of the Year should make it convenient for an Army to make a nearer approach. The King of Poland's Actions this year.But before we conclude the Successes of this Year, we must not omit and pass by the Actions of the King of Poland, of whom we have Wrote, and declared such Heroick and generous Enterprises and Atchievements in the Relation of the last Year's Wars: For being one of the Allies of the Empire, we are not to be silent of him; but give him a place in this History, as well, as we have already done unto our Confederates the Venetians: Thô we shall not need to be very Prolix in our Relations of his great Prowess and Deeds, which fell very Flat, and in no manner agreeable to his first be∣ginnings. The King of Poland enter'd not the Field this Year until the middle of August, when on the 22d of that Month, he took a Re∣view of his Army near unto Budziack; and the next Day he Detached a considerable Party to Invest Jaslowitz, a Town about two Leagues distant from the Camp; and towards the Evening marched thither in Person with the rest of his Army. The next Day Summons were sent to the Town commanding them to Surrender; To which the Governour made this reply, That the Town was committed to him by the Grand Seignior, and accordingly he would de∣fend the same unto the last Extremity: Hereupon Batteries were raised,Jazlowitz taken. and the Cannon having played upon the Town for the space of two or three Days, the Defen∣dants thought fit to Capitulate; and Hosta∣ges being given, the Town was Surren∣der'd on the 26th, when the Garrison, to the number of Five hundred Men, marched out with their Arms and Colours Flying. Af∣ter this the King marched to Swaniec, Situ∣ate on the Niester, over which having made a Bridge, he passed his Army; but having received intelligence, that 30.000 Tartars had made their way into Poland, he return'd again back to the other side. And thô the Tartars are a sort of People, who stay not long in a place, but are in continual Mo∣tion; yet the King had the good Fortune to meet with a Party of them, and Cut Four hundred of them in pieces; the rest not being willing,A party of Tartars defeated. as is their Custom to ad∣venture on a Battle, return'd into their own Country, as did also the King of Poland into his Winter-quarters, the Season of the Summer being already spent. At the Actions and Successes this Year of the Poles, the Turks at Constantinople made an open Scorn and Laughter; (and indeed their slothfulness in doing nothing deserved no better) and made it their common talk and discourse,The Turks censure of the Poles. That the French King, who was their only Friend amongst the Christian Princes, had with his Money and Presents blunted the Sword of Poland, and laid all the Spirits of that Kingdom into a Sleep; and that the young Prince, the eldest Son was Enchanted, and led away Captive by a French Lady: So that the Turks seemed to apprehend no∣thing of danger from Poland; against which they made no Preparations for the ensuing Year, making it the common Subject of their politick Reasonings, and giving it, as it were for granted, That the Poles, Turks and Tartars had for some time entertain∣ed a friendly understanding between each other. The Turks always made slight of the Venetians,And of the Venetians. as of an Enemy whom they could at all times, and at their pleasure crush and suppress; they regarded little, what they had done this Year at St. Maura, or in the Morea, or Dalmatia; the Venetians
having been more beholding for those Suc∣cesses to the Albanians, and others of the Grand Seignior's Subjects, who revolted to them, than to the Power and Conduct of their own Arms; and whensoever Fortune shall but a little change her Hand, they doubt not but to recover their Losses from the Venetians, without much Bloud, or per∣haps but with asking for them. And in∣deed (if it be well considered) the Veneti∣ans, have trifled much in their Proceedings, amusing themselves, and the World, in ta∣king small and inconsiderable Places, in com∣parison of greater Enterprises, and with di∣slodging some Nests of Pyrates, when as they might have a stroke at the very Heart of the Ottoman Empire, by entring the Dardanelli with a Fleet, against which the Turks were not capable to make any Resist∣ance, with less Force than that which was used in taking Santa Maura and Preveza; the Venetians improving the Advantage of the present Fear and Consternation of the Turks, might have made themselves Ma∣sters, of the Castles on the Hellespont, and sailed to Constantinople it self, and destroyed or burnt it without any considerable Oppo∣sition. They might with this Opportunity have destroyed the whole Turkish Fleet of Gallies, which would have made them Ma∣sters of all the Islands in the Archipelago, the yearly Tribute of which is very consi∣derable. They might in all probability have taken twenty Sail of Ships coming from Alexandria, with Janisaries and Mer∣chandize to a considerable Value; which whilst the Venetians were pedling about Santa Maura, arrived at Constantinople to the great Joy and Encouragement of that City. The Pasha of Candia put to Death.About this time the Pasha of Candia's Head was brought to Adrianople, and ex∣posed before the Gate of the Divan; all his Treasure, which was considerable, according to the Custom of the Turks, was confisca∣ted to the Grand Seignior; he was a bad Man, and unmerciful to all sorts and Sects of People; he had strangled the Metropo∣lite or Bishop of Candia, and miserably ty∣rannized over the poor Christians there; and yet for all that, the Crime alledged a∣gainst him was, That he was too indulgent to the Christians; that he had sold them Corn, and held a good Correspondence with the Venetians. The Pasha of Damascus called Ibrahim Pasha, incurred the like Fate; he had been Janisar-Aga, and one of the greatest Men in the Empire; but his Ene∣mies taking advantage of his absence from the Court, upon bare Suggestions, without fairer process, took away his Life. ANNO 1685. BEfore we enter upon the Martial Affairs of this ensuing Year, let us take a short View of the State of things in Christen∣dom, and in Turky, and the Preparations that were making on both sides for car∣rying on a more bloudy War (if it can be possible) than that of the preceding Years. The Eyes of all Christendom,The State of Christen∣dom. and I may say, of the World too, were at a gaze to behold the Successes of ths impor∣tant War; and yet Europe for the most part was either engaged actually in War, or at least in Fears and Jealousies one with ano∣ther. The Plenipotentiaries of France and Spain were at Variance concerning the Confines and Dependencies, and the In∣croachments which the French King made on the Rhine; and Motions in Alsatia, caused such Fears and Jealousies in the Minds of the German Princes, that they with-held much of that Force, which they designed as Auxiliaries to be employed in Service of the Empire, which was then the common Cause and Interest of all Christendom. How∣soever, the generous Elector of Bavaria, a valiant and active Prince, who had in the two last Campaigns improved his youthful Years with the Exercises of War and Mili∣tary Discipline, was resolved to employ his own Person, Armies and Fortune in prose∣cution of this Religious War against the Enemy of Christendom.The Elector of Bavaria Marries with the Emperor's Daughter. The Affections he had to the Welfare of the Imperial He∣reditary Countries, and of all Germany were elevated and rendred more zealous and warm by the Love he professed to the Arch-Duchess Maria Antonia, eldest Daughter of the Emperor, a Princess of great Vertues, whom he afterwards espoused, and with her all the Interest of the House of Austria in so zealous a manner, that he seemed to have contracted the same Desires and Passi∣ons with the Emperor himself. Thô the last two Years Wars had consu∣med both Men and Mony,The Empe∣ror's want of Mony. yet had not the Emperor's Coffers been exhausted, the war∣like People of Germany would not have wanted Soldiers to fight in defence of their Country, nor the respective Princes a readi∣ness to compleat and recruit their Troops beyond the numbers, that, during this War, had appeared in Hungary. The Pope Inno∣cent XI. had already contributed in so libe∣ral a manner, that his Treasure was sunk to a low Ebb, and could not furnish such large Sums as formerly: The Arch-Bishop of Strgonium, Primate of Hungary, an opu∣lent Prelate, who had made large Contribu∣tions, died about this time, aged Ninety three Years; he had also supplied the Im∣perial
Army with vast quantities of Corn out of his own Granaries, which gave a seasonable Relief to the Soldiers before Bu∣da, who were ready to famish in their Trenches for want of Provisions. But to promote the common Cause, Con∣sultations and Treaties were assiduously and warmly held at the Diet at Ratisbone,Treaties with the Princes of the Empire. by the Commissioners and Plenipotentiaries from the Emperor, and by the Agents sent from the Duke of Bavaria to the other Electors, and by the Convention of the Circles held at Norimburg. Moreover, the Emperor dispatched the Count de Thaun, and the Baron of Meyershein for his Envoys extraordinary, to represent unto all the Courts and Princes of Germany the pressing exigency of Affairs, which did not only concern the Emperor and his Hereditary Countries, but did involve likewise the common Interest, Welfare and Safety of the whole Empire, and all Christendom. These Matters being well inculcated, and circula∣ry Letters wrote, and dispatched to the Cities of Saltzburg, Passaw, Ausburg, Cologne, Ratisbone, Norimburg, Ulm and Francfurt, desiring their Assistance with Men and Mo∣ny, with the use of their great Cannon for Service of the Army; in Compensation for which, the like weight of Mettal, was of∣fered, with so much Mony as should pay the Charge of new Casting the Guns, in re∣gard that in the two last Years of War, most of the Emperor's Artillery had been con∣sumed, and the Touch-holes widned and blown, and to New-cast the Mettal a∣gain, there was not time sufficient before the Commencement of the following Cam∣paign. These Matters were so well represented and negotiated in the Courts and Councils of the respective Princes, that nothing al∣most was denyed which was demanded. The Houses of Brunswick and Lunenburgh furnished an Army of Ten thousand fight∣ing Men,Auxiliaries of the Em∣peror. all select and veterane Soldiers, under the Command of experienced Gene∣rals and Officers; and what was of high Importance, they were so early dispeeded, that they arrived at the Camp about the beginning of the Campaign. The Duke of Saxony was not less forward with his Army, which, thô inferiour in number, were yet well-disciplined Soldiers, and conduct∣ed by Officers of approved Valour and Experience. The Arch-Bishop of Saltzburg sent unto the Emperor a Hundred thousand Rix-dollars in lieu of his Quota, and of the Troops which he was obliged to send. The Elector of Brandenburg had promised to send an Army of 12.000 Men into Hungary, with a considerable Train of Artillery, and so to march with them in Person; but the Appearance of Troops from France on the Rhine, and in the Dukedoms of Cleves and Juliers, the Numbers of which still increa∣sing, gave such an Alarum to that Prince and his Neighbours of the Circle, that a stop was given to the Proceedings of his and their Forces; and a supply only sent of Men and Mony according to the Quota in such cases agreed, and established by the ancient Constitutions of the Empire: Not∣withstanding which, the Emperor's Forces in Hungary, contrary to the expectation of all Europe, much exceeded the general Cal∣culation, and composed a better Army, than had during this War appeared on the Plains of Hungary. The Pope was not less solli∣citous than the other Princes in this Chri∣stian Cause;The Pope gives Assi∣stance. towards the Advancement and Maintenance of which, as he had formerly, so also this Year he sent supplies of Mony from Rome to Vienna, and granted unto the Emperor a full third of the annual Rents of all the Ecclesiastical Benefices within his Hereditary Dominions; to exact and raise which, Cardinal Bonvisi, Apostolical Nun∣tio, and the Bishop of Newstadt, were ful∣ly authorized and empowred by the Pope, with Instructions to Erect a particular Of∣fice, wherein it was Registred how much was paid, and how the same was particular∣ly employed and expended for the sole Use and Advancement of this War. Nor were the Turks less sollicitous and active on their side, in their Preparations for the War,The Turks prepare for War. which they still resolved to continue on their defensive part; under which Notion, neither the Grand Seignior nor Vizier Azem were obliged to go in Person. Shitan Ibrahim Pasha, late Governour in Bu∣da, during the Siege, (of whom we have already given a Character) was appointed Seraskier, or General of the Army. And thô the Grand Seignior minded nothing so much as his Sport of Hunting, to which he was so immoderately addicted, that he was scarce persuaded to omit and decline it upon Fridays, and spent two whole Months entirely in it, within the Countries between Adrianople and Constantinople; yet the Grand Vizier, who was esteemed one of the wisest and most experienced Ministers that ever had been in that Place, closely attended and followed the main Concernment, both for raising Mony, and levying Soldiers. As to the first, The Grand Seignior's Treasury had already this Year been twice opened, and at each time, the Value of Four hundred thousand Pounds Sterling had been taken out of it, all which came far short of the necessary Provisions which the War requi∣red. The Naval Forces were very inconsider∣able, consisting only of some few poor Gal∣lies,
commanded by the Mosaip or Favourite to the Grand Seignior, a Person of no great natural Talent of Understanding, and of no Experience in Maritime Affairs;The Turks Forces at Sea. nor were the ten Men of War, which they had for the two Years past been labouring to Equip, in any Posture or Condition to make Sail this Summer; so ignorant and averse are the Turks to all Matters, which belong unto the Seas, and so unable for any Naval Fight, that it seems a Complement or Com∣passion in the Venetians, not to have de∣stroy'd them long before.The Mosaip Admiral. This Mosaip or Favourite, who was Captain Pasha or Ad∣miral of the Seas, had for a long time en∣joyed the Air of his Master's Favour; his Priviledge was to be clothed in the same Habit with the Sultan, to Ride always on his Right-hand, to Converse intimately with him, and sometimes to sit and Eat with him; and yet I never heard, that he was ever e∣steemed for a Man of extraordinary Shapes or Beauty, or to be charming in his Di∣scourse, or to have had any great Talent of Wisdom or Prudence: And therefore if En∣quiry should be made on this Occasion in∣to the Reasons, Why Princes elect such and such for their Favourites, no true Cause in my Opinion can be assigned, unless finding in that Person, of whom they make choice for their Companion, a certain Harmony of Affections and Humour, they love him by Sympathy, and adore their own Image in him, without which, all other Qualities would be mean and contemptible. But to return to the Vizier, his greatest Study and Application was to make Levies by Land, both in Europe and Asia: Com∣mands were dispatched to that Purpose to Aleppo, Damascus, Diarbiquier and Gran Cairo, the remotest parts of the Empire; but those being Countries ill Peopled,Levies made in Europe and Asia. Levies were made with much difficulty; and such as were constrained to go by reason of the far distance from the Rendezvous, came late; many sickned in the March, and some ran away and deserted; and diverse of the Eu∣ropean Troops, which had been harassed the last Year, retired into the Mountains, where they passed the whole Summer; and in the Winter came out from thence, and returned home, where they told Stories, as if they had been engaged in all the Sieges and Bat∣tles, which had happened that Year. The Grand Vizier finding the numbers allotted to be raised, to fall much short of the Quo∣ta, and of a reasonable Calculation, attri∣buted the Default thereof to the negligence of the Musselims or Deputy-Governours to the Pashas, for which some of them were punished with Death; and others being af∣frighted, hereby used all the Tyranny and Force imaginable to compel the poor People unto the Wars; to which many of them going, with much unwillingness, stole aside, and never came so far as the Camp. How∣soever, it was impossible, but that, out of so vast a Tract of Ground, as is the Otto∣man Empire, consisting of many Kingdoms and Principalities, there must be some out of every part, who having Courage enough to sacrifice their Lives for their Religion and Country, came in, and united themselves with the Camp; and these, thô inferiour to the numbers designed and expected, yet composed an Army very formidable, and such as was able to bid defiance to the Forces of Germany. Howsoever the Turks did not think fit to trust so much to their Arms; but that they would first assay and try, if it were possible, to put an end to the War by a fair Accommodation: The Person appointed to manage this Treaty, was Shitan Ibraim, as yet Vizier of Buda, a Person (as we have before-mentioned) of refined Parts, and good Address,The Turke propose a Treaty. and a Cour∣tier fitted for such a Negotiation. In pur∣suance of this Design, this Vizier wrote Letters of Complement to the chief Mini∣sters of State at Vienna, acquainting them of the Grand Seignior's Inclinations to a Peace. And thô it had never been the Custom of the Sultans to be the first Pro∣moters of Peace, or to ask it before it was offered or begged; yet such was the Cle∣mency and Compassion of this Emperor, and his desire to stop the Effusion of Human Blood, that contrary to the Dignity of his Sublime Station, raised above the Throne of earthly Kings, he would now condescend so low, as to be the first who should make this Religious Motion; in order unto which, he desired, that a Pass-port should be sent him for a Chiaus, who was an Armenian by Nation, and (as I think) by Religion a Chri∣stian, freely to pass and repass, and to car∣ry the Proposals, and to Treat thereupon: The Pass-port was accordingly sent,A Chiaus sent to Vi∣enna. and the Armenian conducted to Comorra, where, be∣ing taken rather for a Spy than an Ambas∣sadour, he was so closely confined and guard∣ed, that he complained of his Restraint to be contrary to the Laws of War and Nati∣ons; at length he was guarded to Vienna, where he was detained under Custody, with as jealous and watchful an Eye, as when he was at Comorra: Howsoever, the reception of this Chiaus became the Subject of much Discourse and Talk in the City, and gave occasion to the World to censure, as if the Emperor had designed to make a Peace un∣der-hand, without the Privity and Concur∣rence of the Allies. The Audience of this Chiaus was deferred for some time, until it was promoted and hastned by the Envoy from the Prince of Transilvania, then residing at
that Court, and by him at length conducted to the presence of the President of the Council, to whom he delivered the Propo∣posals and Articles of Peace: The which after mature Examination, seemed to be projected with such Sagacity and Subtlety, without sincere and open Terms, that they were generally concluded to be Fallacious, and not to be Grounds for a faithful and lasting Peace: And so in sine, the Armenian was dispeeded back with this Answer only, That the Emperor could not conclude a Peace without the Concurrence of the King of Poland,He is sent back. and the State of Venice, the true Allies and Confederates with the Em∣peror; by which Answer, the Minister from Apasi Prince of Transilvania being assured of the Emperor's Resolutions to continue the War, changed the Tenure of his former Memorials, and in his Master's Name, pro∣posed that he might remain in a Condition of Neutrality, thinking it more secure to remain as a Friend to both sides, rather than by adhering to one, to rise or fall ac∣cording to the dubious fortune of War. But if we look into the Winter-quarters before we Treat of the Feats of War, which were Actions most fit for the Summer Sea∣son;A misera∣ble Plague and Famin. we shall find the Imperialists and Ba∣varians so miserably in want of all Provi∣sions, and of things necessary for the suste∣nance of Human Life: That one would wonder, how it were possible for these Men to be so soon recover'd, and made fit for new Services and Fatigues. For such was the Famine in the Lower Hungary, that the Inhabitants were forced to Abandon their Dwellings, and Fly for Bread into the Town of Buda; where they were enter∣tained for Day-labourers to Repair the For∣tifications, with the Wages of eight pence a Day, two pounds weight of Bread, and a pint of Wine. In the Emperour's Coun∣try, a Bushel of Wheat, which in the times of Peace, was worth no more than ten Groats, was now advanced in price to Eighteen shillings. In Presbourg the Streets were cover'd with famished and dying Peo∣ple; the Soldiers were either Dead or Lan∣guishing, or had deserted their Colours: A Pestilence, as is natural, followed the Fa∣mine, and Cattle died of the Murrain. The Island Schultz, which used to be the Grana∣ry of the Upper Hungary, was now in a Starving condition, and the Inhabitants for∣ced to Eat Roots and the Barks of Trees: Nay, this Misery and Desolation extended even to Vienna it self, where in the Garden of the Archbishop, two Women were seen to Eat the Raw-flesh of a Horse lately Dead. But for a remedy to this Epidemical Cala∣mity, the Emperor, who is the Common Father of his People, caused great quantities of Corn to be brought from all the Neigh∣bouring Countries round about; but the Ways were so broken by the great Rains and Marching of Armies, and heavy Car∣riages, that the People were brought to the last extremity before the supplies ar∣rived. Notwithstanding this great want of Provisions, even to a Famin, and the Snows and Rains, which fell in abundance, with Cold Weather of the Winter; General Schultz with a Body of Four thousand Ger∣man Horse and Dragoons, and some Com∣panies of Hussars, maintained a Blocade round Newhausel. To Relieve which, Count Tekeli,Blocade o Newhausel. and the Pasha of Agria were parti∣cularly encharged with the Commission: Tekeli had 6000 Men which he had drawn from the Frontier Garrison, and the Pasha had Four thousand, which were all his own Troops. General Schultz being informed of their motion fell upon them with such bravery, that he put them to a total Rout, without much loss or fighting, and took most of their Provisions and Baggage, which were designed for the Relief of that place. Howsoever, Tekeli made a second adven∣ture for the Succour of Newhausel, and with a Party of Three thousand Horse, he made way for a Convoy of Three hundred Carts,A Convoy brought thither. laden with all sorts of Ammuniti∣on and Provisions, with as many Horse, each carrying a Sack of Meal to enter into the Town: In the strength and encourage∣ment of which, the Garrison made Incur∣sions at four and five Leagues distance, Plundering and Destroying all before them, which caused the poor Inhabitants to aban∣don their Dwellings, and seek for Succour and Refuge in fortified places. Not long afterwards a second Convoy brought Two thousand Sacks more of Meal into the Town, which with the former were good Preparations against a Siege; but to pre∣vent the like for the future, Count Palfi, who commanded the Hungarian Troops, was order'd to joyn with Colonel Heusler, who having but Two or Three thousand Men, was so unable to guard the Avenues to Newhausel, that the Blocade seemed of no importance: But Heusler being thus con∣siderably reinforced, he defeated a third Convoy which the Turks were sending to the Town, consisting of Eighty Waggons,Other Con∣voys. which carried Ammunitions and Provisios, and Sixty more of Timber for Building and Repair of the Fortifications. A fourth at∣tempt was again made to carry Succours into Newhausel, of which General Schultz having intelligence, he lay in the way and intercepted them, killing Three hundred of the Enemy upon the place, and putting the rest to Flight. Tekeli having notice of this Defeat, pursued after Schultz with a Rein∣forcement
of some Turks, and having over∣taken him in the Mountains between Soniati and Rozenau, he Charged him with such Success,Successes of Tekeli. that he killed Nine hundred of his Men, and took Four hundred Prisoners with all their Baggage. Afterwards meeting with a Regiment of Bavarians in their Win∣ter-quarters at Neudorf, he entirely defeat∣ed them, and so returned to Newhausel, which he again Relieved with another Con∣voy. The Spring coming forward with the time for Action; the Emperor's Council calling to mind the Miscarriages of the last Year, caused for the most part by extream Famine, and want of necessary Provisions for the Soldiery, all possible care was taken to prevent the same for the succeeding Year; and such quantities of Corn from the more remote parts of Germany, and from Poland it self, which is a Country abounding with Wheat, and all sorts of Grain, were brought and laid up in Magazines, as were judged sufficient to sustain the Army for the whole Year without such wants, under which it lately labour'd. All the remaining part of this Winter was spent about Esperies, or intercepting Con∣voys designed to Newhausel.Esperies. Esperies is a Town of Hungary in the County of Sarax very well fortified, Situate upon the River of Tarbez towards the Mountains, and on the Frontiers of Poland; it hath always be∣longed to the Emperor as King of Hungary, until such time as in the Year 1678, it fell into the Hands of Tekeli, from whom it was recover'd by force of the Imperial Arms in the Year 1685. Howsoever, at the beginning thereof, the attempt of Ge∣neral Schultz was fruitless, and of evil con∣sequence; for laying Siege to it in the Win∣ter, the Cold and extream Weather, and want of all things necessary, enforced him to Rise again with the loss of Five hundred Soldiers killed and wounded, with several Captains and other Officers, who were all slain by the many brisk and desperate Sallies which the Defendant made from the Town: And being upon his Retreat, Tekeli in person Charged him in the Rear at the Head of his own Men with such Success, that he defeated the whole Party, and Schultz with much difficulty saved his Can∣nn. Towards the end of February Five hun∣dred Janisaries, and Three hundred Spahees belonging to Newhausel, possessed themselves of the Fortress of Gutta,Gutta ta∣ken. after a Fight of nine Hours; the Garrison consisted only of One hundred and fifty Hussars, under the command of a Lieutenant, who with two Soldiers only escaped to Commorra, all the rest being put to the Sword. This Town is Situate on the River Waagh; it was Built during the late Wars in a Moorish or Fen∣ny place, between the Danube, the Waagh and Swartz; it is butFive English Miles. a Mile from New∣hausel, and may be seen from the Top of the Steeple of the great Church. The Turks having made themselves Masters of Gutta, were carrying away the Plunder with two pieces of Cannon to Newhausel. Two thousand Spahees, and Six hundred Janisaries were giving Convoy unto Sixty Waggons laden with Ammunition for the same place, when Colonel Heusler with several Detach∣ments from Comorra, Papa, Vesprin and Le∣ventz, endeavour'd to obstruct their Passage by Ambuscades which he had laid in their way: Of which the Turks having had notice, they alter'd their Course, and endeavour'd to fortifie themselves in some advantagious Ground; but Heusler joyning with Count Zabor, allowed them not time to secure themselves, but attacked them near Weit∣zen with such Bravery, that he put them all to Flight, and seized on their Waggons,Successes of Colonel Heusler. with the Provisions in them, which he burnt, because he knew not in what manner to carry them off safe: He afterwards took Weitzen, and put all the Garrison to the Sword; which having done, he received in∣formation that a Pasha with Five hundred Janisaries appointed for Convoy to Five hundred Waggons, drawn by Five Oxen a∣piece, were retir'd within a little Fortress not far distant, where they concealed them∣selves until the Enemy was retired; he im∣mediately went and invested the place, where he killed the greatest part of the Ja∣nisaries, took the Pasha with many Prison∣ers, and all the Waggons, which he carried to Leventz. About the same time the Marquis Doria, and the Baron of Soyes having passed the Tibiscus with a strong Detachment of Bava∣rian Troops,A party of Malecon∣tents de∣feated. and a Hundred Horse belong∣ing to the Regiment of Caraffa, defeated a Party of Five hundred Horse belonging to the Malecontents, killed Four hundred of them, took twenty Prisoners with eight Colours, and a considerable Booty. But General Schultz was not so succesful in his Attempt upon Ungwar, being forced to Retire from thence with considerable loss. The Successes of General Heusler much troubled the Thoughts of the Vizier of Buda, and the Seraskier, in what manner to defend themselves against the Complaints which Tekeli and the Pasha of Novigrade had made against them to the Grand Seig∣nior: To prevent which, and stop these insinuations from receiving credit,The Pashas Erla and Novigrade strangled. they caused the Pasha of Novigrade to be Strang∣led, with the Pasha of Erla, after which
they dispatch'd two Agas to the Port with all expedition to be before-hand with their Com∣plaints against Tekeli, and the Pashas, repre∣senting that they had put the two Pashas to Death for their Cowardise and evil Conduct, with some Reflections upon Tekeli, as if he entertain'd a secret Correspondence with the Christians. The Grand Seignior and Grand Vizier, being prepossessed with these first advices, applauded the care and justice of the Vizier of Buda, and Seraskier, advising them to be careful in the chocie of such Men, who were to succeed them in those Offices of Trust. Notwithstanding the advantage which Te∣keli had gained over General Schultz before Esperies, and given it some Relief; yet the Town laboured under great want of necessary Provisions,A Convoy sent to Re∣lieve Espe∣ries, taken. to supply which Tekeli sent a strong Convoy to support the place with Grain Flesh, Pulse and all things required for a Siege: But Schultz recovering his Forces, and animated with desire of Revenge, watch∣ed his opportunity to fall on the Convoy, which he charged with such Vigour and Bravery, that he killed Three hundred on the place, took all their Carriages, with great quantities Tokay Wine. Thus did all matters proceed with vari∣ous Successes on both sides; the Imperialists having it in their intentions, to open the Campaign with the taking of Newhausel, made a Preparation thereunto by cutting off all Convoys, and Succours which were design'd for it's Relief: The Turks labour'd to support it, and lost many Men this Win∣ter in the Enterprise; and more particularly remarkable was that Defeat which Colonel Heusler (after having destroyed all the Country to the Gates of Newhausel) gave unto a Party of Five hundred Spahees and Three hundred Janisaries,Another Convoy de∣feated. assembled in the Neighbouring Villages, to give Convoy to great numbers of Waggons laden with Pro∣visions for supply of the Garrison; the Fight was very warm, and doubtful for some time; but the Spahees at length turn∣ing their Backs, left the Janisaries exposed, who still maintained their ground under the shelter of the Trenches, which they had hastily cast up, and the Covert of their Waggons with which they had encompas∣sed themselves: But being at length over∣whelmed with numbers, they were entirely overthrown, Two hundred of their Men were killed with an Aga, and about Forty Prisoners taken, with all their Waggons to the number of Forty, laden with Provisions: To compleat this Victory, the Imperialists lost not above ten Men, and freed above Fifty Christians out of Slavery; and of all this Detachment not above Two hundred Re-enter'd the Garrison, the remainder be∣ing either dispersed, or else had made their Escape to Novigrade. The Great Vizier being informed of these Successes, and thereby made appre∣hensive of the danger of losing Newhausel, resolved to bend the main Force of the Ot∣toman Empire against Hungary. The War on the Frontiers of Poland seemed not so formidable, as to need much Aid; the Tartars,The Turks slight the Poles. who in times past were considered as Free-booters, and like Locusts and Cat∣terpillers, fit only for Rapin and Spoil, and to lay a Country Desolate, were not ranked in the number of Martial and Well-disci∣plin'd Troops, and esteemed a match sufficient for that Warlike Kingdom of Poland. The Tartars, who availed themselves much on this late Opinion, which the World had con∣ceived of them, began to stand on their Terms with the Polish and Ottoman Courts: The first offer'd them considerable rewards to accept of a Neutrality;The Poles and Tartars Treat. and the latter fearing lest this Mercenary People should fall from their dependance on the Port, overcame their Minds with greater Sums, than what had been offer'd by Poland, to∣gether with a Concession of all the Ukrain, to which the Grand Seignior would resign his Title unto them, and annex it to their Dominions, provided they would recover it again by force of their own Arms. The Proposals of the Sultan being accompanied with a certain Harmony of Affection and Religion, which is between the Turks and this People, were more charming than the faint Offers from Poland, and fixed them in their Resolution to Live and Die, Stand and Fall with the Ottoman Interest. The Season of the Year being now well advanc'd, and the Weather become mild and sit for Action; the Imperial Troops from the Hereditary Countries, with the Auxiliaries and Bands of Voluntiers, com∣posed of divers Nations, began to descend from Moravia, and with their Officers to march towards the place of General Ren∣devous,The place of General Render∣vous. appointed in the Plains between Newhausel and Barkan, being esteemed the most convenient Situation for Atchieving any Enterprise, according to the Resolu∣tions of a Council of War. The Imperial Army consisted of Twenty four or Twenty five thousand Men, but the Auxiliaries were above double the number: The House of Brunswick furnished 10.000 Fighting Men, Commanded by Prince George William, el∣dest Son of the Duke of Hanover, who marched in the Head of them. General Chauver commanded the Troops of the Prince of Zell. The Elector of Cologne sent Six thousand effective Men, and the City Six hundred, composed in all of Forty five Companies of Foot, Twelve of Horse and
Ten of Dragoons: All the other Electors and Princes of the Circle complied with their Quotas according to Agreement,The Forces of the Cir∣cles. Com¦manded by Officers of Experience and Bravery. The Archbishop of Saltzburg over and above the Money already mentioned, contributed to this Summers expedition, a considerable Train of heavy Cannon: So that the Quotas of the Empire according to the true Calculation, amounted unto Forty thousand Men, besides 16.000 Bavarians, all vete∣rane and experienced Soldiers, which were added as Recruits to the other Forces, al∣ready emploied in the War of the last Year. Count Rabata was appointed Commissary General for raising and amassing Provisions wherewith to supply the Army; and for the more effectual performance thereof, it was recommended as a particular Charge to every Circle,Care taken to supply the Army with Pro∣visions. to furnish their Men respe∣ctively, with a sufficiency of Victuals for the Campaign; by which means there was an abundance of all things in the Camp, and the Army freed of the misery of Famine at∣tended with Pestilence; which two evils ruined all the designs of the last Year. About the beginning of May General Palfi was order'd to march into Hungary, and joyn with Colonel Heusler at the Blo∣cade of Newhausel; which they so streight∣ned, that the Pasha Governour of that place, turn'd out all useless Persons out of the Town, who were not capable to bear Arms, and so many of the Christian Slaves,May. as served only to consume and lessen the Provisions, and not defend the Town: By these Persons the Commanders received information, that the Garrison con∣sisted only of Two or Three thousand Jani∣saries, of which a great number was Sick and Infirm. The better to reinforce the Blocade, and streighten the place in such manner, that it might receive no Relief either of Men or Victuals,Newhausel streightned. three thousand Horse, and as many Foot were sent to joyn with Heusler and Palfi, and with them many Carts and Waggons laden with all sorts of Ammuni∣tion and Provisions, by which there was no want of any thing necessary for the com∣fort, and encouragement of the Soldiery, that so with the more Strength and Vigour they might be ready to oppose a strong Party which was preparing at Pest, to Convoy Eight hundred Carts with Victuals, and to make way for them into the Town by Force of Arms. At this time that Palfi and Heusler were emploied in Blocking up Newhausel, Gener∣al Lesly departed from Vienna to Gratz, from whence he drew his Forces into the Field in order to march into Croatia, where he was to Command this Year, with a Rein∣forcement of Seven thousand Men more than he had the last. General Schultz, who had newly distribu∣ted a Hundred thousand Florins amongst his Soldiers, finding them Couragious and in good Heart, was resolved to begin the Campaign with the notable Exploit of lay∣ing Siege to Ungwar, a small, but the Capi∣tal City of the County of Ung, in which Tekeli had placed a strong Garrison. So soon as he invested it, he took a Redoubt, and began to make his Approaches, and raise his Batteries, and throw Bombs into the Town; and having by his Cannon opened a sufficient Breach in the Walls, he Stormed it, and with great slaughter and loss of Men,Ungwar taken. he entred and took the Town; and without giving the Enemy farther respite, he Invest∣ed the Castle, and lodged his Soldiers in the Ditch, where in the space of three Days he lost Three hundred Men, besides Twenty Officers killed and wounded. Upon this News, the Male-contents, with a great Bo∣dy, came to relieve the Place; but General Schultz bravely encountred them, gave them a Repulse, and took three of their Stan∣dards; and returning with this Success back to the Siege, he was ready to give Fire unto a Mine, when News came that Tekeli having joyned himself to a strong Body of Tartars, was marching against him,Schultz for∣ced to leave the Town. he rai∣sed the Siege with so much Hast and Pre∣cipitation, that he was constrained to leave the greatest part of his Artillery behind him, after he had lost Nine hundred Men, which were killed, and Two hundred wound∣ed; amongst which was Count Strafoldo, who was shot through the Arm with a Musquet-bullet, and Baron Arti his Lieute∣nant Colonel, was wounded likewise. It was now the beginning of June, when the Duke of Loraine, appointed General of the Imperial and Confederate Forces, with ab∣solute Power and Authority from the Empe∣ror, came to the Army, which was encamped near unto Gran,A Council of War called. where a Council of War was held, and therein diversely debated, whether they should begin this Campaign with the Siege of Novigrade, which would interrupt all Communication between Buda and Newhausel; or return again to Buda, where the Fortifications were not as yet ful∣ly repaired, nor the Inhabitants totally freed from the dread and fear of their late Dan∣ger; but upon farther examination of this Matter, it was made to appear, that Buda was in a much better Condition than it was before the Siege;June. for that the Fortifications were all finished, and made better and stronger than they were formerly; that the new Governour had demolished all the Hou∣ses, which had been ruined and defaced by the Bombs, and totally destroyed the Su∣burbs;
that the Garrison consisted of Ten thousand Men, all stout and brave Soldiers; that the Seraskier,The state of Buda. with the like number of Men, had encamped between Buda and Al∣ba Regalis, and 12.000 more had passed the Bridge to joyn with a Body of Ten thousand Tartars, so that impossible in a manner it was to lay a Siege, which was daily in hazard of being disturbed by such potent Armies. The Enterprise upon Novigrode seemed much more feasible; but before any Resolution would be taken therein, the Duke of Lo∣raine, with General Souches, Scaffemburg, Colonel Beck, and several Officers belong∣ing to the Artillery and Ingineers, thought fit to take a view of the Works and Situa∣tion of the Place. The Duke at the head of Three thousand select Horse, command∣ed by Count Caprara, on the 25th passed the River Grana, on a Bridge of Boats, and foorded over the River Hippol, which, at that Season of the Summer, was not deep∣er than the Bellies of the Horses. The next Day before Noon they came in sight of No∣vigrode, and by their Appearance, gave an Alarum to the Town and Castle, from whence they fired many of their Cannon, for a Signal to those who were abroad, la∣bouring in their Vineyards, or keeping watch over their Cattle in the Field, to ha∣sten back and retire under security of the Fortress: The Report of the Guns warned every one of the Danger, so that the Guar∣dians of the Cattle, as well as others, drove in their Herds from their Pastures as fast as possible; but could not make such speed, as to get them all into Security, before the Hussars, a People used to that kind of Prey, came up with them, and seized a great share of the Cattle, driving them away for Service of their own Camp: And thô a Par∣ty of Horse sallied out of the Garrison up∣on them, endeavouring to regain the Spoil, yet being supported by a stronger Body, they retired within the Palisadoes, where they were received by several Chambers of Janisaries. Novigrode▪Novigrode is raised upon a high craggy Rock, fortified by Nature, and the Way so narrow as is not capable to receive above one Man a-breast, and encompassed with a Ditch of about Thirty four Foot deep; this Place was taken from the Christians in the Year 1663. The Duke of Loraine, and the other Generals and Engeniers, ha∣ving well observed the Situation of the Place, and all the difficult Accesses thereun∣to, sounded a Retreat, and began their March back again to the Camp; the Rear-guard being committed to the Care and Con∣duct of the Count de Ofkirk, with whom were several Princes in Quality of Volun∣tiers, as the Prince de Conti, de la Roche Sur-yon, de Commerci & de Turenne. Upon this Retreat, a Party of the Turkish Caval∣ry sallied out of the Town, seeming as if they resolved to fall on the Rear, with de∣sign only to draw them into an Ambuscade of Janisaries, who lay hid in certain Hedg∣es and Bushes, not far distant from the open Road. The Stratagem succeeded in part; for these young Gallants thirsting after Glo∣ry, and desirous of an Engagement with the Enemy, could not refrain from pursuing the Turks to the place of Danger, where in all probability they had most certainly been de∣stroyed, had not the Duke of Loraine sent some Troops seasonably to their Relief. The next Day this Party being returned from Novi∣grode to the Camp, General Caprara, who lay confined in his Bed by a Fever, delivered into the Hands of the Duke of Loraine a Letter from diverse poor Christian Slaves, Greeks, Hungarians, and others in Newhausel, miserably complaining of their Servitude, and of the Famine of that Place, which was so great, that they were ready to Pe∣rish for want of Food;False Let∣ters deli∣vered to the Duke of Loraine. so that in case he would only appear with his Army before that Place, the Distress of it, by reason of Famine, was such, as would cause them to Surrender without farther Violence or loss of Time. The Particulars of the State of this Place, was again confirmed by a Turk, who carrying Letters from Newhausel to Buda, was intercepted in the way, and brought to the Camp; where being exami∣ned before a Council of Officers, he there confirmed the Truth of what was related in the Letter, and that the Garrison did not exceed Twelve hundred Men; so that the Pasha, an ancient Soldier, did much lament the Miseries of the Place, which he could not maintain, and must either be forced to make a Surrender of it, or else Sacrifice his own, and the Lives of all the Inhabitants, to the Fury of the Enemy. This Report se∣conding the Letter wrote from the Christian Captives, the Truth thereof was no longer doubted, so that without farther dispute or demurr, it was resolved, at a Council of War, to open this Campaign with the Siege of Newhausel; thô in reality both the Let∣ter was feigned, and the Report given by the Turk false, as will appear hereafter, be∣fore we make an end of the Siege of this Place: Howsoever, it served for the pre∣sent to alter the design from Novigrode,The Siege of Newhausel resolved. and turn it on Newhausel, against which all Pre∣parations were making, and Orders sent to the Prince of Hanover to advance towards the Town, and cause his Men to provide them∣selves with Faggots and Timber to make Gabions, with other Materials necessary for this Enterprise; and all the Boats, and Floats for Bridges, which lay below Comor∣ra,
were ordered to be drawn up against the Stream: And lest in the mean time, du∣ring this Siege,Preparati∣ons there∣unto. the Seraskier thinking to make a Diversion, should lay Siege either to Strigonium or Vicegrade, the latter Gar∣rison was reinforced with Three hundred Men, and the former with Fifteen hundred, under the Command of Count Mansfeld, be∣sides several Troops of Hussars, who were appointed to scower the Country round, and observe the Motion of the Enemy. July.All things being prepared in order to a Siege, on the third of July the Duke of Loraine Commanded the whole Army to raise the Camp, and March towards New∣hausel; and on the 6th they pitched at a Bog or Fenny place in sight of the Town, being hindred from proceeding farther by the Storms and continual Rains, which gave great retardment and stop to their March: But to lose no time, General Heusler was appointed with a Party of Horse to survey the Fenns, and give an account of the Ways and Passages over it;Heusler beats a Party of the Enemies Horse. and meeting with a Party of Horse belonging to the Garrison, which was commanded to prevent and stop his Passage, he charged them with such vi∣gour, as caused them to fly back to the Town, pursuing them to the very Gates thereof. After which, having well observed that the Fenns were not to be passed by the Infantry, it was ordered, That every Horse-man should mount a Footman behind him; so that the Day following all the Army pas∣sed, and encamped by the Banks of the River Nitria or Neutra, about Cannon-shot distant from the Town. At the appearance of the Christian Army, the Turkish Garrison being greatly dismayed, they quitted the Palanca, which was raised at the Gate of Strigonium, and broke the Island-Bridge, causing all their Forces to be dispersed without the Town in little Forts and Redoubts, to retire within, that being gathered into a Body, they might be the bet∣ter enabled to make a valiant and an obsti∣nate Resistance. The same Day the Pasha opened the Store-houses of the Place, where Provisions were laid up in such abundance, that, being distributed with Frugality, and managed with good Husbandry, were suffi∣cient to conserve and maintain the City for many Months without Famine. The Town Surveyed.But before the Siege was formed, the Duke of Loraine, with other Officers and Persons of Note and Quality, took a View or Survey of the Town, to discover the parts and places where the Attacks might be carried forward with the best Advantage, and tryed where the River Neutra was ford∣able, as it was at that Season of the Year in diverse places. In the mean time, the Troops of Hanover and Zell, Commanded by the Prince of Hanover, and his Lieute∣nant General Chauvet arrived in the Camp, against whom the Turks spent many of their Cannon-shot without any Effect; which Troops being drawn up in open Field, made so good an Appearance in all Respects, as gave great Satisfaction to the Duke of Lo∣raine, and the other General Officers. On the 9th about Noon, the Bavarian Infantry advanced forward, commanded in chief by Count Serini. On the 10th the Imperial Generals, with the Elector of Bavaria, and the Prince of Hanover, designed the place where the Town should be first attacked; and Horses were sent, and Waggons to draw up the heavy Cannon which were arrived in Boats near to the Camp, and the places chalked out and designed where the Batteries were to be raised. On the 11th a Council of War was held,The Form of the Siege resolved, and there resolved by all the General Offi∣cers to open the Trenches, and to make the main Attack at the same place and side on which the Turks had done, when they took the Town in the Year 1663. Great Labours were used on the 12th to enlarge the Trenches, joyning unto which there was a Vally, which served for a Pa∣rade, wide enough to draw up Two thou∣sand Men, and therein to remain under Covert, and out of danger of the Enemies Shot. Two Lines also were drawn,and descri∣bed. one towards the Point of the Bastion adjoyn∣ing to the Port of Strigonium, and another leading to the Bastion which was contiguous to it; and on this part of the Town the chief Effort was to be made. The Bavari∣ans maintained the Attack on the Gate-side, and the Imperialists the other; and a third Attack was intended on the side to∣wards Vienna, on the Banks of the River Neutra, which was to be committed unto the Swedes,The Swedes come to the Siege. so soon as they entred into the Camp, as they did the Day following; and having formed their Trenches, they cut a Drain from the Town Ditch, where being a kind of declivity, the Water fell in abun∣dance, and ran with a full Channel into the Neutra. To these several Attacks Three thousand Men were every Day appointed to relieve each other, under Command of the General of the Artillery, two Sergeant-Majors of Battalions, two Colonels, and o∣ther subordinate Officers, which the Prince of Croy, Count Serini, and the Duke of Hanover were successively to Command, ac∣cording to their turns. All the Day following was spent in open∣ing and enlarging the Trenches,The Trench∣es enlarged. which were broad enough to contain three Men a-breast, and advanced unto Five or Six hundred Paces in length; and sufficient Ground se∣cured
to lengthen them about One hundred and fifty Paces more, which would reach un∣to the side of the Ditch; all which was per∣formed without any considerable loss, not∣withstanding the continual Firings from the Enemy, both of small and great Shot. At the end of every Line a Redoubt was rai∣sed, and a Parallel Line of Communicati∣on drawn from one Attack unto the other, with a place of Parade in the middle, about which three Batteries were raising, one be∣hind the Line of Communication, which was to be the biggest, containing Seventeen or Eighteen Pieces of Cannon, because it was to front and succour the other Bat∣teries on each side; the other two were to the right Hand, and to the left of five Pieces of Cannon, each to Flank the main Battery. On the 14th, the Redoubts, the Parallel Lines of Communication, the Parade, and the Trenches were all perfected and suffici∣ently opened, so that now the Siege was completely formed; and an Allodgment prepared on the brink of the Ditch; which thô the Besieged did endeavour to disturb by constantly Shooting on the Workmen,The Siege formed. yet nothing hinder'd to perfect the Allodg∣ment which was made wide, and extreamly well fortified on all sides. The City of Newhausel is Situate on a Plain with some little rising Hills about it, and on the Banks of the River Neutra; it is not far from Comorra, and about a Days Journey from Strigonium; it is en∣compassed by six Bastions,Newhausel according to the manner of the modern Fortifications; the distance of the Curtains, and of the Flank∣ers are of an exact equality, and the Form is a Sex-Agon, or Six-Angles. After the Turks had taken it in the Year 1663, they brought the Neutra round the Town and filled the Ditch with Water, and made it so Deep, that it was almost impossible to form any Mine under it. The presence of the Duke of Loraine, who was always an Overseer and director in making the Trenches, in which he for the most part remain'd until after Mid∣night, did very much contribute to the dispatch of that Work: So that between the 14th and 21th all matters requisite for the Siege were finished, the Allodgment on the brink of the Ditch was more enlarged than before, the Water whereof being Fathomed, was found to be seventeen or eighteen Foot in Depth; and sometime increased, notwith∣standing the Drain, by the excessive Rains, which not only supplied it with Water, but much incommoded the Soldiers in their Trenches.The Batte∣ries make a Breach. The Batteries continually plaid with good Success, and not only had bea∣ten down a great part of the Parapet, but had made a considerable Breach in the Ba∣stion it self; which they intended to widen, and open yet more by the help of another Battery newly raised, consisting of eighteen Pieces of Cannon; but whilst these things were in agitation, News was brought to the Duke of Loraine, that the Turkish Army began to march towards Buda and Alba Re∣galis, and that Six thousand Turks and Tar∣tars were advanced towards Vicegrade. Up∣on this intelligence General Lesly, who was appointed to watch the Motion of the Ene∣my, was Order'd to endeavour unto the utmost of his power to hinder and obstruct the Passage of the Seraskier over the River Sava and Drave;Leisly at∣tend the Motion of the Seras∣kiers. and Colonel Heusler with Two thousand Horse was dispeeded towards Pest, to get intelligence of the Designs of the Vizier: Soon after this Advices came, That the Seraskier was advancing with all his Forces towards Buda, and had made a Bridge not far from thence over the Da∣nube; but that it was not yet known, whe∣ther he intended to attempt the raising of the Siege, or to Sit down before some Town whereby to make a diversion: But to be better provided, and in a readiness either to meet the Seraskier in the Field, or to defeat his Attempt against any fortified Place; The Duke of Loraine order'd a De∣tachment of a Regiment of Savoiard Dra∣goons, to joyn with some of the Bavarian and Lunenburg Troops, to the number of Three thousand Men, and therewith to Re∣inforce those Regiments, which guarded the Bridge of Comorra. During the time that a considerable Force was employ'd to observe the Motion of the Seraskier, the Siege was carried on with all imaginable Courage and Resolution; the Cannon continually fired from the several Batteries, and the Bombs and Carcasses were thrown into the Fortress with such good Success, that on the 22d,The Town on Fire. the Town appear'd to Smoak and Flame in three sever∣al places, which continued all Night, to the great Terrour and Labour of the Defen∣dants: But at length by the great Rains which fell, the Fires were not only extin∣guished, but the Christians very much in∣commoded in their Trenches, and the Wa∣ters of the Ditch increased, as fast almost as they were sunk by the Drain: So that it seeming a long and tedious Work, before the Ditch could be emptied of it's Water; a contrivance was made to pass a Miner over the Ditch in a Boat, and six it to the Breach in the Wall; but the Boat recei∣ving a Shot from the Town, was ready to sink, and those therein were so incommo∣ded with showers of Stones from the smal∣ler Guns, and Petreras planted on the Walls, that they were forced to Retire, and give over that Design.
On the 24th, the Defendants made a Sally on that side, where a Guard was ap∣pointed of Swedes and Suabians to defend the Drain, which was made to sink the Water of the Ditch; and surprized them at a time,A Sally from the Town. when they were overcharged with Wine, which they had unfortunatly gotten, and laid for the most part in so profound a Sleep, without so much as a Match light∣ed, that a Hundred of them with their Lieutenant Colonel, two Captains and two Lieutenants did never awake from their natural Sleep, but insensibly passed from it, into the last Sleep of Death. The Turks return'd back again into the Town with∣out much harm; but with great Joy and Triumph, which they testified by the Mu∣sick, which was heard from the Walls into the Trenches. But on the 25th, greater care was taken with the Guards on that side, and endea∣vours used to enlarge the Channel, which being perform'd, the Water in the Ditch sunk eight Foot,The Ditch filled with Rubbish. so that the Faggots, Stones and Rubbish were prepar'd to fill it up; and that Labour so closely followed, that in one Night the Ditch was half filled up on that side, where the Imperialists were lodg∣ed: But on that of the Bavarians, they ad∣vanced little, by Reason that the Defen∣dants fired so continually from the Parapet of the Bastion, which was opposite to them, as disturbed the Work, and hinder'd them very much in carrying Faggots and Rub∣bish, so freely as was done on the other side. The Work was how to fill the Ditch on each side, as well where the Imperialists, as where the Bavarians were Quarter'd: To prevent which, the Turks on the 27th, about Noon made a Sally by the Port of Strigoni∣um; and stopped the Channel, by which the Water vented it self out of the Ditch and ran into the River; but being opposed by Three hundred Bavarians they received a Repulse, and made their Retreat back in∣to the Town;The diffi∣culty of draining the Ditch. the Bank being again open∣ed, the Water fell so low, that the Imperi∣alists discover'd a secret Passage, by which the wet and moorish Ground kept a Cor∣respondence with the Ditch, and supplied it with some Waters from thence; the Chri∣stians endeavour'd to stop this Conveyance, and the Turks to open it, so that what one did by Day, the other destroy'd by the Night. The increase of the Waters in the Ditch, caused the Besiegers to despair of being able to effect any thing by their Mines;Galleries prepared. but finding that their Batteries opened the Breach more and more, they resolved to per∣form their work by the two Attacks, on the right and on the left Hand: The two Gal∣leries were in a short time advanced; that to the right, went drawing near to the Wall, being well cover'd, and flanked with Baskets, Barrels and Gabions filled with Earth, in which Action the Lieutenant Co∣lonel of Count Souches was killed: The Turks labour'd with all possible Industry to keep off the Approach of these Galleries, which most certainly threatned the Ruin of the Town; to effect which, they threw certain artificial Fire-works upon the Gal∣leries,They are burned. composed of Sulphur and Bituminous matter, which burn'd so violently, that it was impossible to extinguish it, until it had laid all in Ashes; and so forcibly did it burn, that it took hold of the next Batte∣ry, and set Fire to the Powder in it, with which divers of the Gunners, to the number of Forty Men were Blown up. Nor did the Gallery on the left Hand fare any thing better, for the Turks shot such numbers of Arrows with artificial Fires into it, that nothing could resist the violence of the Flames: All the Gallery took Fire, with the Parapet and Neighbouring Battery,The Galle∣ries and Batteries burnt. and burn'd with such fierceness, that it became too hot for the Guards, and dismounted four Pieces of Cannon. The Duke of Loraine came immediately in Person to the assi∣stance of the place, and remained where the Fire was most impetuous, commanding the Officers to march their Troops to that place; and in the mean time employed all his Servants and Attendants, who were a∣bout him, even his very Pages to stop and extinguish the Fire. The Example of the General was so prevalent, that every one gave a helping hand, with such diligence and vigour, that the Fire was extinguished, and a great part of the Battery was saved, with the Cannon and Powder: Whilst this Action was doing, all those who work'd about the Fire lay open to the shot of the Enemy, of which about Sixty Soldiers were killed, and twelve of them near to the Per∣son of the Duke, who exposed himself without fear to the utmost Peril of his Life. The Fire being extinguished, Order was given to repair the Damage which the Fire had done; which accordingly was execu∣ted with such diligence, that on the next Night following the Parapet was repaired, and the Cannon being remounted began a∣gain to Batter the Town; new Galleries were also making of such matter, as should not be so easily combustible as the former. The Disorders being composed which were caused by these Fires,The Elector of Bavaria comes to the Camp. the Elector of Bavaria enter'd the Camp; and immediate∣ly repaired to that part where his Soldiers were lodged. The Duke of Loraine having made him a Visit, and passed those Com∣plements
which are due to his Person, and Character; he attended him abroad and showed him all the Attacks, the Approaches, Batteries, and the whole Form of the Siege. Whilest matters were thus in Action at the Siege, Advices were daily brought of the Seraskier's motion, that his whole Army consisted of 60.000 Men, including the Tartars, and lay Encamped at the Foot of St. Gerard's Mount near Buda, with Twenty five Pieces of Cannon, small and great. The Tur∣kish Army near Buda.On the 26th it was certainly advised, that they had passed the Danube, and that the Van-guard bended towards Vaitz, and the Rear-guard towards Vicegrade and Strigo∣nium. Upon this intelligence it was almost certainly concluded, That the Turks intend∣ed with one part of the Army to lay Siege to Strigonium, and with the other to attempt the Relief of Newhausel; to confirm which two Hussars about the close of the Even∣ing, brought News, that the Turkish Army about Noon of the same Day, had pitched their Camp in sight of Strigonium, and had made a Bridge at the Isle of St. Andrew, for better Communication of their Troops. It being now out of all doubt, that the Turks would either Invest Strigonium or Novi∣grade; the Duke of Loraine with the con∣currence of his Electoral Highness the Duke of Bavaria, resolved to leave 16.000 Men under the command and conduct of Count Caprara to continue the Siege; and with the Gross of his Army to march against the Seraskier; but before their departure they had the satisfaction to see the four Regi∣ments of Infantry belonging to the Elector of Cologne,Their mo∣tion obser∣ved. to come and joyn with them, all brave and stout Men well Armed and well Clothed. Colonel Heusler, who with Fifteen hundred Horse watched (as we have said) the Motion of the Enemy, gave cer∣tain intelligence, that on the 30th of July, the City and Castle of Strigonium were In∣vested by the Seraskier, which caused the Duke of Loraine to hasten his march to∣wards the Relief of that place, leaving all things belonging to the Siege in very good order.Strigonium besieged. The News sent by Colonel Heusler, was confirmed on the 4th of August, by Report of the Cannon, which being car∣ried by a favourable Wind, were heard at the Siege before Newhausel: The Duke of Loraine being on his march, passed his Army consisting of 40.000 fighting Men over the Waagh on a Bridge of Boats, ben∣ding towards Comorra: On their way thi∣ther intelligence was given them, that the Night before, the Turkish Army had been Alarum'd by a Party of Hussars which had fallen in upon their Baggage: Howsoever, they continued still to force the Place, ha∣ving given a fierce Assault upon the lower Tower Town, but were bravely repulsed. This News quickning the march of the Army, the next Day they passed the Da∣nube upon two Bridges near to Comorra, and afterwards Ranged the whole Army into order of Battle: The Imperial Troops were divided in the first and second Lines of the two Wings; with them joyned some Dra∣goons, and some Battalions of the Allies;The Order of the Christian Army. the Elector of Bavaria Commanded the left Wing; the main Body of Bavarians and Swedes were comprehended in this Wing, and that of Franconia and Lunenburg in the Right; the Prince of Hanover and General Chauvet, Commanded at the Head of their own Troops, as the Marquis of Tutriac, and other Generals of the Allies at the Front of theirs. Count Rabata General of the Horse, the Commissary General, Count Palfi and Baron Mercy, and other Chief Officers were of the left Wing; Prince Lewis of Baden, Count Dunewaldt, Count Taaf and Stirhaim, Major General, were added to the right Wing. Prince Waldeck and Count de Fonta∣na, one of the Major Generals marched at the Head of their Troops, and Prince Lubomiski commanded the Cannon: In this order the Army marched, and on the 10th of August they Encamped within three hours march of Strigonium: And the next Day approaching yet nearer, the Report of the Cannon, and all Noise towards the Town seemed to cease; so that it was con∣cluded, that either the Town was taken, or the Siege raised. Whilst they were in this suspense, the Garrision of Vicegrade came in sight of the Camp,They are met by the Garrison of Vicegrade. to the great surprise of the Generals, who until that time, had never been informed that the place had been Invested by any part of the Ottoman Army: It seem'd a little strange to meet that Garrison in the open Field, march∣ing with their Arms and Baggage, with their Matches Lighted, their Drums Bea∣ting, and their Colours Flying; but this Wonder ceased, when the Officer in Chief acquainted the Generals, how that the For∣tress of Vicegrade, had sustained a Siege for the space of sixteen Days, against all the Force of the Ottoman Army; that the Tower which was adjoyning to the Castle was Blown up, which made so wide a Breach, that it was impossible to sustain another Assault of the Enemy, having endured two Assaults before: And therefore, after a loss of the greatest part of the Garrison, which was reduced from Three hundred and fifty to One hundred and thirty Soldiers, the Surrender thereof seemed excusable, and not to be imputed to the Cowardize, or want of Conduct either in the Comman∣der, or in the Souldiers. There was also something more than ordinary in the be∣haviour
of the Turks towards the Garrison, when this place was Surrender'd: For they out of a Principle of hatred to the Chri∣stian Religion, and of scorn and indignation against all People, but those of their own Profession, were commonly provoked to use their Victories with Pride and unlimited Insolence; and to break their Faith and Engagements,The Turks Civility to that Gar∣rison. to which they had obliged themselves by Articles and Capitulations; did now contrary to their usual practice, Treat the vanquished of this Fortress with due respect and kindness; and lest any thing should happen, which might seem dis∣agreeable to their Capitulations in their march by Land, care was taken to Tran∣sport them in Boats, and to Land them as near as was possible to the Christian Camp; and for the better security on the way, they were accompanied by three Turkish Officers, whom the Duke of Loraine treated with a Civility, corresponding unto which they had used towards the Garrison. The next Day being the 11th of August, the Christian Army pitched their Tents at Almatz, about a League distant from Stri∣gonium: From whence an Officer was sent to Complement the Duke of Loraine, and the other Generals, with a Relation of what the Turks had acted in the late Siege: He told them,A Relation of the Siege of Strigo∣nium. That one the 30th and 31st of the last Month their Approaches were begun (as were to be seen) on the side to∣wards Comorra, at the Foot of St. Thomas his Mount, and were in two Days time, carried on to the Counterscarp of the low∣er City, where they Sprang four Mines, and seconded them with as many Assaults, in which so many were killed, that the Ditch seemed to be levelled, and filled up with the dead Bodies of the Slain, and made equal with the Border of the Counterscarp. In fine, About two Days before, the Turks ha∣ving received certain Intelligence of the Ap∣proach of the Christian Army for their Re∣lief, had raised the Siege with so much hast and precipitation, as gave Courage to the Defendants to make a Sally upon them at their departure; and falling on their Rear, took a Bloody Farewel of them, with the Slaughter of Three hundred of their Men. The Success of Strigonium made some a∣mends for the loss of Vicegrade, and gave undoubted proofs, that where is any equa∣lity in Force, the Christian Valour and Conduct, challenges Fortune to be of their side, and to favour and assist them. The Duke of Loraine having recruited the Garrison of Strigonium with Five hun∣dred Foot, and succoured it with Ammuni∣tion, and Provisions necessary for it's De∣fence; raised his Camp on the 13th, and marched away in quest of the Seraskier, with resolution to give him Battle, in case the moorish and fenny Grounds, which in∣terposed between the two Armies, did not prevent the Engagement.The two Armies in sight of each other. The Day follow∣ing, with rising of the Sun was opened a clear Scene, representing the whole Tur∣kish Army, which having passed the Danube to joyn with some Tartarian and Turkish Troops, were Encamped on the farther side of a fenny or moorish Ground, which lies between Newhausal and Senan, extending it self from the Banks of the River to a cer∣tain rising Ground, on which they had plan∣ted their whole Train of Artillery; the Ap∣pearance of which seemed very formidable, and not consisting of less than 55 or 60.000 fighting Men, which for the most part were experienced Soldiers, who had tried the Dint of the Enemies Sword, and often without fear beheld Death in the Face. The fenny and moorish Ground, which interposed between the two Armies, was the Bar which restrain'd the Courage and Mettle of the Christians; who otherwise, in despight of all disadvantages, where had been any possibility of Engagement, would have broke through all to have closed and mixed with their Enemy. To perform which, the boggy Ground was tried and assaied on all sides; but being found unpas∣sable, the Generals feigned a kind of fear, and unwillingness to Engage, in expectation thereby to draw the Enemy to remove; so that raising their Camp, as if they had fear∣ed a Battle, the Turks carried on by their own Destiny, followed after them, leaving the place of a more advantagious Ground. The Christians retreating at the distance of an hour's march,The Chri∣stians Re∣treat. drew up in the Form and Order before mentioned, extending their left Wing towards the Danube, and their right towards the Hills of Saran. The Se∣raskier animated with this Retreat, as if it had been caused by his more formidable Force, which much exceeded the Christi∣ans in their numbers,And are followed by the Turks. raised his Camp and followed the motion of the Christians; and leaving a great part of the Infantry, with the heavy Cannon behind, on the rising of the Hill; on the 15th and 16th Instant, he passed the moorish Ground, and marched towards the Enemy. At break of Day in Morning, so great a Fog or Mist arose, that for some hours neither Army could discover the motions of the other; during which time the Christians had the advantage to draw up their Army undiscerned into a posture of Battle, and to reinforce the left Wing with some Regiments, which were not as yet disposed. No sooner was the Army drawn up in its due Order, than the Fog dispersed, and a bright Day appeared, which showed the two Armies each to the other,
both moving with a slow and regular Pace to joyn Battle. The Turks, who are of the more fiery and fierce Temper,A Battle begun. caused their left Wing to March with some hast to charge the right Wing of the Christians; upon which they three times made an Attempt, but the Germans, who stood firm and unshaken like a Rock, three times repulsed them with great Slaughter: The Duke of Loraine per∣ceiving that the Turks pressed the right Wing with their main force, caused his left Wing to move with a slow pace to their Suc∣cour: The German Foot were conducted by their Captains at the head of their re∣spective Companies, with their Artillery in the Front; which being charged with Mus∣quet-bullets, were fired upon them so op∣portunely, and seconded by Vollies of small Shot, that the Turks began to draw back at some distance. The Seraskier observing the disorder of his left Wing, advanced with a strong Body of Turks to charge the utmost part of the right Wing of the Christians; to sustain which, the Duke of Loraine re∣doubled the firing of the first Line, and commanded Count Dunewald to reinforce the first Line with such Squadrons and Bat∣talions of the second Line, as were nearest unto it. The Elector of Bavaria coming at the same time to their Assistance, put the Turks into a disorder and confusion, and afterwards forced them to make a Retreat, and draw a little off. The Hungarian Troops which were accustomed to the Turkish man∣ner of Fighting, were order'd to charge them in the Rear; which having done, they wheel'd about and made a stand. So soon as the Turks were out of reach of the Ger∣man Musquets, they rallied again, and made another Charge as furiously as they had done the first; but the Imperialists maintaining their Ground, and not giving one Foot backwards, many principal Officers amongst the Turks fell in this Charge at the head of their Squadrons, which caused a second Disorder amongst them, and to turn their Backs; and being pursued slowly by some Troops, which continually fired upon them, they were put to the rout and fled.The Turks defeated. The right Wing of the Turks observing the Disorder of the left, wheel'd about towards that side, not only to Succour the flying Party, but to joyn with them to make a second Effort and tryal of their Fortune: To this Purpose a considerable Detachment advanced to charge the Christians in the Flank; but being repulsed, the whole Army was put to flight, and being pursued by the Hungarians, Croats, and some Troops of Dragoons, fear so possessed many of them, that they took their Way, without any consideration, over the Moorish or Fenny Grounds, where, sinking up to their Middles in the Water, and their Horses plunging in the Boggy places, above Two thousand Men were lost and perished in the Quag-mires. In the mean time, the right Wing of the Christian Army having knowledge of the Passage over the Marsh, by the Turks, who led them the Way, pur∣sued them beyond the soft Ground; and perceiving that the Turks began to rally on the top of the Hill, where they had left their Cannon with some Chambers of their Janisaries; they made a stand until the Duke of Bavaria was come up with the left Wing. So soon as these two Bodies were joyned on the other side of the Moor∣ish Ground, the Turks durst not stand ano∣ther shock; but leaving their Camp, Tents, Cannon, Baggage and Ammunition, they all betook themselves to a shameful flight: Such was the general Fear and Consternati∣on amongst them, that they fled by three several Ways; and the Janisaries to Re∣venge themselves on the Spahees, for expo∣sing and abandoning them upon the Hill, killed many of them to get their Horses. Thô the Turks in the first Action did not lose above Four thousand Men, yet double the Number perished in the Fenny Ground, and in the Pursuit the Seraskier himself was wounded, and Osman Pasha of Gran Cairo, and two other Pashas were killed. The Christians lost not above Two hundred Men, and took but few Prisoners, because that gi∣ving Quarter was almost out of Fashion:The Loss which the Turks su∣stained. The Pursuit continued not far, by reason that the Turkish Horse were more nimble than the Christian, and fled to Buda and Alba Regalis; the Foot saved themselves in the Woods and in the Mountains: Howsoever, afterwards in more cool Bloud, many were hunted out, who had layn hid amongst the Reeds and Ofiers which grew in the wet and marshy Grounds, so that about Four hundred Priso∣ners might be taken, and many Christian Slaves obtained their Freedom. The Turks lost Thirty eight Colours, Twenty three Pieces of Cannon, two Mortars, and great store of all sorts of Ammunition. After the Battle was ended, Te Deum was sung, and Thanks publickly render'd in the Camp to Almighty God for so signal a Victory; and the Prince of Neuburg was dispatched with all diligence to render an account unto the Emperor of the happy Success of that for∣tunate Day. Whilst the Turks were engaged in Battle, and their Army routed and totally defeated; their Garrison in Newhausel declined, and the Besiegers daily advanced upon them. The Galleries were again refitted and repaired, and the Soldiers lodged at the Foot of the Breach,All things ready for an Assault upon New∣hausel▪ so that all things were ready for a general Assault, only Count Caprara thought fit to demand first the Orders of the Duke of Lo∣raine,
not knowing whether he might be de∣sirous to be present at this great Action, to add the Subjection of this Place to the Glo∣ry of his late Victory: But the great Mind of the Duke, which was zealous for the Service of the Emperor, and the Christian Cause, gave orders not to defer the Assault for one Moment; but first to advise the Besieged of the defeat of their Seraskier, and to verify the same by some Prisoners taken in the late Battle, which were sent into the Town, that being informed of their des∣perate Condition, they might be induced to accept Terms of Mercy for their Lives. The 18th was the Day appointed for this Attempt, but the Rains were so violent, that it was thought fit to expect more fa∣vourable Weather, and to break some Pali∣sadoes with the Cannon, which were newly erected within the Breach. The next Morn∣ing being the 19th, at break of Day, the signal of the Assault was given by the dis∣charge of Thirty six Pieces of Cannon, up∣on which,An Assault made. immediately Three thousand Men were appointed to make the Assault. Count Scaffemberg, at the head of his Men, Com∣manded the Attack in face of the right Ba∣stion, and mounted thereupon without the loss of one Man, and was followed by the Troops of Lunenburg and Suabia; the Turks now losing their Courage, did not dispute the Breach with such Resolution as was a∣greeable to the Resistance they had made at first, and thereby gave opportunity to Scaf∣femberg to possess himself of the Bastion without much difficulty. The Baron of Asti, and Colonel Kaletz, who Commanded the other Attacks, with the Troops of Co∣logne, Bavaria and Franconia, were in like manner successful, and planted the Imperial Standards on the Breach, where a Pasha which Commanded it was killed; he was a Native of Bohemia, and of the Family of Garasba. In the Bastion Eight hundred Men were slain, excepng Two or Three hundred, who cast themselves over the Wall into the Ditch, where they met the Sword of the Bavarians, and under that, ended their Days. All this time Seventy Pieces of Cannon continually plaid upon the Town, and Twenty Mortar-pieces which threw Bombs and Carcasses, and Three thousand Men already upon the Walls and within the Town, in which Amazement the Turks spread a white Flag, which was the signal of a Parly or of a Surrender: But alas it was too late; for the Christians being al∣ready Masters of the Town, they killed all without remorse, or distinction of Age or Sex, either of Men, Women or Children. The Governour of the Place died the next Day of his Wounds which he had received on the Breach; the Garrison which consist∣ed of Three thousand Men, was reduced to On thousand Seven hundred, most of which also were killed on that fatal Day.The Town is taken. At length the Town being taken, Orders were given to stop the effusion of Blood, which came only in time to save the Lives of about Two hundred Persons. In the Town Eighty Pieces of Cannon were taken, with great quantities of Am∣munition. About Forty Christian Slaves were set at liberty: The Plunder of the Town was esteemed to amount unto two Millions, besides Plate, good Furniture, and Moveables belonging to the Houses. There were Fifty Horses of Price taken, which were distributed amongst the General Offi∣cers; all which was performed with the loss of Fifty Soldiers only, and one Lieu∣tenant. So soon as the Place was taken, Count Scaffemberg took Post to carry the joyful News thereof unto the Emperor, who was graciously pleased, in Reward of his Services, to conferr upon him the Go∣vernment of that Place. The News of two such Atchievements, as the defeat of the Turkish Army, and taking Newhausel filled all Christendom with Joy and Wonder, and Thanks to Almighty God for such glori∣ous and unexpected Successes; which also being accompanied with the taking of E∣speries, by General Schultz, and the burning of the Town and Bridge of Esseck, by Count Lesly, increased the Jubilee of that Year in Christendom; as on the contrary, never was there such a Damp on the Spirits of the Turks, nor such Sorrow and Grief as at that time: For the Loss having been Uni∣versal through the whole Empire, the Death of Friends and Relations was lamented, as far as to Bagdat or Babylon it self, and to other remote parts of the East. The Advice of taking Newhausel was brought to the Duke of Loraine, whilst he was in Discourse with the Elector of Bava∣ria, and the other Generals, of carrying on the Wars with such other Enterprise, as might conclude and terminate this Cam∣paign with the greater Glory. Upon the News hereof, the Generals moved with a desire to see the Place,The dismal Condition of Newhau∣sel. enter'd into it on the 20th, and there beheld the most horrid Spectacle of Slaughter and Desolation in the World. To cover which, immediate Orders were given to bury the Dead, and to repair the Breaches which the Cannon had made in the Walls, and, with the La∣bour of Turkish Slaves, to fill up the Tren∣ches and Approaches which were made without the Town during the Siege. The Christian Slaves, which, on occasion of the late Defeat, had escaped out of the hands of the Turks, came in great numbers to New∣hausel, and there related, how that the Se∣raskier
was come to Buda with a slight Wound in his Leg;The ill Con∣dition of the Tur¦kish Army. that the Confusion amongst the Turks was so great, that they killed and robbed one the other, in the Flight; that in the Sieges of Strigonium and Vicegrade, they had lost at least Four thousand Men; and that the latter place was so weakned by blowing up the Tower, and required so much time and labour to repair it, that they expected Orders from the Seraskier to de∣molish and abandon the Place. And in fine, That the Turkish Forces were so scatter'd and divided, that after all these losses and discouragements, they were scarce able to Rally an Army of 30.000 Men. We having not thought fit to interrupt the Relation of two such great Matters, as the Fight near Strigonium, and the Siege of Newhausal, with a Digression unto other A∣ctions; which being now past, let us look back, and behold the Progress which Count Lesly, and General Schultz were making a∣gainst the Common Enemy in different Places. Lesly being advanced into the Country near Kanisia, had the good for∣tune to meet a Party of Turks, belonging to that place, which he defeated, and with the Slaughter of several hundred of them, cau∣sed the rest to Fly into their Fortress. After which with an Army of about Eight thousand Men, composed of Croats, Hun∣garians and Germans, he resolved to render himself Master of the Bridge of Esseck:The Expe∣dition of Count Les¦ly to the Bridge of Esseck. In order whereunto, having left his Baggage at Turnawitz, under the Custody and Guard of Two thousand Men, he marched away on the 9th of August, with Four thousand Germans and Two thousand Croats, all choise and experienced Soldiers towards Esseck, taking with them Provisions for ten Days, in regard the Country was so wasted and destroyed by the War, that it yielded nei∣ther Food for Men, nor Forage almost for Horses. The same Day a Detachment was made of Five hundred Croats, under the Command of an Officer to Invest Michalo∣witz, which upon the first Summons Sur∣render'd, before the Body of the Army ap∣peared, without making any Terms, or Conditions for their Liberty. The Guard of this Fort was committed to the defence of Two hundred Foot and One hundred Heyduks; and the Prisoners taken, both Men, Women and Children were secured in a Tow∣er belonging to the Fortress. After which the Army marched with all diligence towards Esseck: Upon sight hereof, the little Forts and Palancas on the way, fired their Guns to Alarum the Country round about; and passing by Carafina, which is a Town forti∣fied with strong Walls, and a double Ditch, the Turks Sallied forth with Horse and Foot, and Skirmished with some of the Troops, without any great hurt or damage on ei∣ther side. After three or four Days of hard march, Lesly drew up his Forces on the 13th of the Month, into order of Battle in the Plains of Esseck, expecting to meet the Enemy in those Parts: But finding no opposition, they pitched their Tents, and Hutts so much to ad∣vantage, and which took up so much Ground, as if they had contained an Army of at least 30.000 Men: Soon afterwards, a Thousand Turkish Horse came and took a view of the Camp, with some Infantry marching in their Rear. Whereupon the Army Commanded by Siaus Pasha, drew out into order of Battle, and marched soft∣ly against the Enemy, who stood firm, nei∣ther advancing nor retiring,The Turks near Es∣seck defea∣ted. until the Chri∣stians were come within Musquet-shot; and then they began to give Ground, which the Croats perceiving fell upon both their Wings, and gave them a total Rout and Defeat. The Horse fled by the way of Belgrade, but being hotly pursued by the Croats, se∣veral of them were killed; but the Foot found a nearer Refuge in the Town and Castle of Esseck. The German Horse and Foot, advanced still in good Order to the Suburbs of the Town, which at the first Assault they took, and Plunder'd; and thence found an easy entrance into the City it self; from whence the Turks had the Day before sent their Wives and Chil∣dren by Water towards the Danube, into which the Drave falls not far from the City: Those who remain'd, were with their Goods and Moveables retired into the Castle. The City of Esseck is not very large, but well peopled and well fortified; and as I remember, after the modern fashion; it hath about Five hundred Shops belonging to Tradesmen,Esseck. and adorned with many Mosques and Caravasaries, or Inns built for the Reception of Travellers, which are com∣monly stately Structures. It is very strange, that this place which was esteemed so strong, and well fortified by the Turks, that they made it their Granary, and Store-House for all sorts of Provisions for sup∣ply of those Parts of the Country, should so easily be abandoned, and opened to the Enemy, which was capable of sustaining a Siege of many Months against an Army of far greater Force, than that of Count Lesly's,Taken by Count Lesly. which did not exceed Six thousand Men; especially being well provided with quanti∣ties of Rice, Bread, Bisket, Salt and pow∣der'd Flesh; and with Barly and Oats; all which served greatly to refresh, and feed the Men and Horse of Count Lesly's Army, which were languishing before for want of Victuals, the ten Days Provisions which they had taken with them being almost
consumed. So soon as Lesly became Ma∣ster of the Town, Guards were set to op∣pose any Sally from the Castle, whilst the Soldiers were Ransacking the Houses, un∣to whom all the Plunder and Pillage was given. In the mean time, Count Lesly went to take a view of the Bridge, like which there is none in the World, and of which we have already given a Description in the former part of our History: The Ri∣ver Drave is not very broad in this place, there being only Sixteen Boats to sustain the Bridge, which the Turks had broken down the Day before, loosing them that they might drive down the Stream; the Christians endeavoured to recover them the next day following, but could not get a∣board for want of smaller Boats; nor could they for want of this Bridge, pass over the Drave to burn the Bridge of Esseck, which on that side is Eight thousand Paces long, and all built of Oak. 'Tis true, Money and good Rewards were offer'd to some French Soldiers, of the Regiment of Erbe∣ville, who with certain Germans and Cro∣ats under-took to pass the River, and burn a great part of the Bridge; but the Boats on which they endeavoured to pass were so small and leaky, that they sunk under them, and saved themselves only by Swimming. Howsoever, That part of the Bridge which was on the Town side, being Eleven hun∣dred Paces in length, was in a very short time reduced to Ashes: Whilst these things were acting, a Rumour was spread amongst the Soldiers, that all the Riches of the Pasha, and Moveables of value belonging to the Citizens, were conserved within the Castle; which so animated the Soldiers to make an Assault up it, that Count Lesly could not restrain them from running the utmost hazard of Storming the place with open Force: But whilst they were preparing Faggots, and other combustible Matter, to fix at the Gate which looks towards the City, a furious Fite took in divers Houses, caused by the Rabble of the Soldiers, which burnt so violently, by reason that all the Houses are built with Wood, and the very Streets Planked with Boards and Timber;Esseck burnt. the Ground being a Clay, and sort of Ow∣sey Earth, not capable of a Stony Pave∣ment; that there was no possibility to quench it, or to Approach near to the Gate of the Castle on that side, so that in a few hours the whole Town was utterly con∣sumed: Wherefore they fixed some artifi∣cial Fire to the other Gate, on the Bridge side, with which both the Gate and the Bridge burnt together, without much of∣fence to the Defendants within the Castle; but rather, the Fire and the Retrenchment made within, served to secure them from an Assault: Wherefore General Lesly thought fit, not to Attempt any thing further upon the Castle, but having left all the Town in Ruins, he returned back the next Day to Turanowitz, where he had left Two thou∣sand Men to Guard and Secure the Bag∣gage. With the good News of this Success, Prince Deichtrestein was dispatched to the Emperor, and for Confirmation there∣of, he carried with him five Colours of the Fourteen, which were taken from the Turks. Whilst these matters were acting to the advancement and Glory of the Christian Arms, General Schultz on the 19th of July,Schultz before Es∣peries. began to lay Siege to the Town of Esperies, and by the 8th of August had formed all his Works, Trenches, and raised his Batteries, and threw such quantities of Bombs and Carcasses into the Town, that it took Fire in divers places. Esperies is a City of Hun∣gary, in the County of Sarax, very well fortified, Situate on the River of Tarbez to∣wards the Mountains, and on the Frontiers of Poland; and hath always been consider'd by the Malecontents as a strong place, and of great importance to them: The Garri∣son consisted of a Thousand Soldiers, all stout and brave Men, and more resolute than the Turks; for the Malecontents ha∣ving been provoked by the ill usage, which the Emperor guided by his evil Council had put upon them, were always more ob∣stinate and fierce in Fight; either, because they were made Angry by Oppression, or became desperate, and out of all hopes to obtain Pardon from the Emperor: Some Attempts were made by Tekeli to Rein∣force the Garrison with Six hundred Men, but they were prevented and beaten back; and the Besieged made their Sallies, but with ill Success, which moved them on the 16th to display a white Flag in token of a Parly; but so soon, as some Soldiers and Officers came near to receive their Offers, they with-drew their Flag and Fired upon them, killing a Lieutenant and four Sol∣diers. Schultz being justly incensed with this Treacherous Action, omitted nothing which might destroy the Enemy: He con∣tinually threw Bombs into the Town, and Batter'd the Walls; and having opened a Breach, an Assault was made, but his Sol∣diers were repulsed with considerable loss. After which a Mine being formed, and rea∣dy to Spring, the Malecontes on the 10th of September desired a Parly; but their late act of Treachery made the Imperialists more cautious in their Dealing with them, and to give them no answer, until they had sent two Officers for Hostages; those in the Town refusing so to do, the General more furiously plied his Cannon and Bombs than
before. But at length, the Governour be∣ing made sensible of the impossibility of de∣fending the Place much longer;Capitula∣tions made. desired to Capitulate, and sent Hostages for assurance of the Treaty, which was concluded on the 18th of September, on these following Articles. First, That the Commander, and several of the Officers and Soldiers being Germans, should be received into the Service of the Em∣peror, and be advanced a Month's Pay. Secondly, That such as were not willing to enter into the Emperor's Service might have liberty to return to Tekeli, and to have safe Conduct into his Quarters. Thirdly, That the Inhabitants should have a free Exercise of their Religion, and that the Churches and Schools should remain in the same Condition, as before, and enjoy the like Freedom and Liberty, as those did, which had on the same Agreement and Articles submit∣ted to the Emperor. Fourthly, That the Nobility might be re∣stor'd to their Estates, and having taken a new Oath of Fidelity to the Emperor, might quietly enjoy the Privileges belonging to Noble Persons. Fifthly, That the Magistrates of the Town, and Judges shall continue in their respective Offices, and Places of Trust. Sixthly, That the City shall be conserved and exempted from the Plunder of the Sol∣diery. And finally, That these particulars shall be approved and ratified by the Em∣peror. These Articles being agreed, a Surrender was made; but with much difficulty could General Schultz, and the Duke of Wirtem∣berg restrain the German Soldiers,The Ger∣man Sol∣diers be∣longing to the Gar∣rison en∣deavour to Plun∣der. who be∣longed to the Garrison, and had taken part with Tekeli, from Plundering the Town: For they being inform'd of the many Suc∣cesses of the Imperial Arms, were desirous to shew their Zeal to the Cause of the Emperor, and so signalize the Return to their Duty and Allegiance, by opening the great Gate of the City to the Soldiers of the Duke of Wirtemberg, with liberty to Plunder and Spoil together with them∣selves; but General Schultz and the Duke of Wirtemberg being resolved to maintain the Articles, Order'd two Officers with a Thou∣sand Men to Enter by the Breach, and at the Postern Gate; whilst the Duke of Wir∣temberg with Two hundred Men joyned with the Germans of the Garrison, and together marched into the Town. These Germans were so Zealous to testify their Loyalty and Kindness to their Country Men, That they invite them to fall upon the Spoil, and to Plunder with them; but by the care and good conduct of the Generals a stop was put thereunto, and the Town preser¦ved from Pillage, according to the Tenure of the Capitulations. The Day following General Schultz en∣ter'd the Town, and caused the Ditch to be cleared of the dead Bodies, and the same to be decently Interr'd; and the Breach with all possible speed to be repair'd. On the Walls were found Thirty Pieces of Cannon mounted, with a Mortar-piece car∣rying Sixty pounds Weight, and several Thousands of Cannon Bullets, the greatest part of which were Cast by the Imperialists in the time of the late Siege;Provisions and Am∣munition in the Town. when the Town was taken by Tekeli in the Year 1678. There was no want of Provisions in the Town, nor of Powder, of which there was One hundred and twenty one pounds weight. The Germans who were Two hun∣dred and seventy in number, of which Thir∣ty were Dragoons, were Listed into the Emperor's Service, as also the greatest part of the Talpazzi, a sort of Hungarian Sol∣diers under their Hadnag or Captain. The others which were but Eleven, Swore never to Fight more against his Imperial Maje∣sty, but to return home, and live quietly and in peace amongst their Neighbours. Such vertue and power hath good fortune, and success in War, that it not only sub∣dues by Force of Arms, but converts the Minds of Mankind, making them wise and gentle, free from Passion and Masters of Reason. The taking of Esperies was followed by that of Cassovia, which contrary to the Ex∣pectation of the Court at Vienna held out a formal Siege, and made a Vigorous Re∣sistance. Cassovia called by the Hungari∣ans Caschaw, is the Capital City of the County of Abanwivar;Cassovia. it is very well for∣tified, being Situate on the River of Kun∣nert, which empties it self into the Tibis∣cus. Thô it be a Town which enjoys great Privileges, yet it hath long acknow∣ledged and submitted to the Emperor, as King of Hungary; but in August 1682, it was unhappily taken, and possessed by Te∣keli and his Party, and continued firm to them until this Year 1685. When on the 6th of the Month of Octo∣ber, Count Caprara appear'd with his Army before Cassovia,Caprara Besieges Cassovia. and immediately rai∣sed two Batteries, from which he warmly plied his Cannon and Mortars upon the Town; the like was return'd from thence upon the Besiegers with much more Damage. The Garrison within the Town, consisted only at first of Four hundred Soldiers be∣sides the Citizens, who were resolved to hold  unto the last Extremity. The Count eterhasi, who was a valiant Man,
and the best Soldier of all those belonging to Tekeli, had made some overtures of returning to his Obedience, and to the Allegiance which he owed unto the Em∣peror; but all proved nothing but a mere Plot,Peterhasi relieves Cassovia. and design to convey himself with Seven hundred Men into the Town: The which having succeeded according to his desire, the Defendants were greatly there∣by Reinforced, and animated to make a more Vigorous Resistance than could be expected. For on the 8th the Besieged made a Sal∣ly and passed far within the Trenches; and thô they were forced at length to Retire, yet above Eighty Men were killed on both sides. On the 14th, Count Caprara Summoned the Town, and received a fierce and disdainful Answer; and the same Day three or four Sallies more were made, in which many were Slain, and amongst the rest the Prince of Wirtemberg, with several other Persons of Quality. In the mean time General Schultz took the Castles of Kalo, Ibrano and Vihel belonging to Tekeli; as the Generals Heusler, and Mercy had done of all the small Places about Erla, for better convenience and enlarge∣ment of Winter-quarters. Count Caprara continued still to Batter the Town, but with little effect, in regard the Garrison within was strong and reso∣lute: And the differences which happen'd between General Schultz and Caprara, were great obstructions to the Surrender of that place: But at length an accommo∣dation, and good understanding being made between those two Generals, Schultz came to the Siege, and joyned his Army with that of Caprara, with which united Force a vigorous Attack being made, the City came to Terms of Treaty,Cassovia surrendred. and Surren∣der'd on the 25th Day of this Month of October. Thus have we related the particulars of all the most Glorious Successes, with which the Imperial Arms were blessed this Year in Hungary; which We have done so Am∣ply, that we shall not need to add much more thereunto, until we have given an Account of the Progress of the Veneti∣an Arms, which though very prosper∣ous and considerable this Year in the Morea; yet we thought not fit to inter∣rupt the Story of the dreadful Wars in Hungary, by a Digression to any other A∣ction.
THE Venetian Successes AGAINST The TURKS, 1685. WHILST the Morlaques re∣tained in the Service of the Republick of Venice, made frequent Incursions and Spoyls on the Turks in Dalmatia; The Mai∣niotes, (who are another sort of People, much like the Morlaques) being animated with the Venetian Successes, began to take up Arms against the Turks: But for better understanding of what is to follow, we will describe a little the Countries and Humours of these two People. The Morlaques are a People who inhabit the Mountains of Cro∣atia, on that side which looks towards the Adriatick Sea. In the Year 1647, the Pa∣sha of Bosna and Tekeli,The Mor∣laques. Father or Grand-fa∣ther of the famous Tekeli of these Times, committed a Massacre upon many of these poor People at Knin; in resentment whereof, at the instance of a certain Priest called Stephen Horien, who could mannage his Sword as well as his Crucifix, wholly sub∣mitted themselves to the Venetians, and desired to live under their Protection: They receive no Pay from them, but have the Reward of a Sequin (which is Nine Shil∣lings Six-pence English) for the Head of every Turk which they bring to the Vene∣tian Officers; for Lucre of which, they have made such constant Enterprises upon the Turks, and such cruel Slaughters, as have rendred them irreconcilable Enemies to the Port. They are a sort of Militia always on the Wing, under no Discipline but their own, encamp on the Plains, but live with their Families in the Mountains, avoiding the Licentiousness which much Conversation brings, and the Luxury of Cities: They have no Learning amongst them, nor understand much what belongs to keeping Faith or Promises with an Ene∣my, as appears by their dealing with the Turks of the Garrison of Clissa, which in the Year 1648, having surrendred it self up to the Venetians on Capitulations, as the Soldiers were marching out of the Town, they fell upon them, and killed Twelve hundred Men; and not one of the rest had escaped, had not the Venetian Officers interposed their Persons and Au∣thority to save those who as yet survi∣ved. The Mainiotes are in their Manners and Honesty not much differing from the Mor∣laques, thô much distant from their Coun∣try. They are called Mainiotes from Brac∣cio di Maina, or an Arm of Land in the Morea, stretching it self out into the Sea; so called by the Venetians, but anciently part of the Country of the Lacedemonians:The Maini∣otes. These People by their nearness to the Sea, and ruggedness of their Mountains, have in despight of the Turkish Arms, conserved themselves after the manner of the Ancient Greeks, in form of a Republick, whereby they had some kind of Government and Ju∣stice amongst themselves, thô they enter∣tained a Turkish Aga or Lord, rather out of Respect to the Turks, than Subjection; but as to other People, they lived upon the Spoil, keeping no honest Intercourse with them, unless with the Venetians, whom they feared, because of their Gallies which fre∣quented their Ports. In the Isle of Cervi, which belongs to them, and about Cape St. Angelo, which is opposite to the Isle of Cerigo, they maintain several Brigantines, with which, when thy take Christians, they transport them over to Tripoli in Barbary; where they find a Market for them; and when they have the fortune to seize Turks, they sell them to Venice, or to Malta; and so are Free-booters on all sides: I could of my own Knowledge, give diverse Instances of their way of Trading, and of their Treat∣ment used towards some Englishmen of my,
own Company, who unadvisedly and with∣out due regard, set footing on their Land; but because it is not material to our present Discourse, and would be too great a Devi∣ation from our present History, we shall wave all that, and proceed to shew, That the Mainiotes hearing of the ill Success of the Turks in all places, and that their For∣tune was changed, declared for the Veneti∣ans, to whom they were more inclined on account of the Christian Religion, profes∣sing to be of the Greek Church, and to follow that Party and Interest which they observed to be in the most thriving Condi∣tion.The Maini∣otes worst the Turks The Turks to prevent the Revolt of the Mainiotes, sent some Forces to reduce them; but they being supported by Veneti∣an Succours, under Seignior Delfino, with∣stood the Turks, and charged them with so much Vigour, that of Three thousand five hundred Men, there escaped but an Hundred and Forty, all the rest being either killed or taken. The News hereof encouraged the Greeks of Monte Nero, which is a Mountain in the Morea, to descend and Combate with the Turks on the Plains, in which Fight ma∣ny were killed and wounded on both sides. In the mean time Paulo Michiel, a noble Venetian, with a Thousand Horse and some Foot joyned with Three thousand Morlaques, made Incursions into the Country round a∣bout. The Pasha of Bosna, who with Se∣ven thousand Men was on his March to∣wards Hungary, alarum'd by these Forces, returned back to Clin, for Conservation of his own Country: And having alter'd the Design and Expedition of that Year, he re∣solved to wage War nearer home in Dalma∣tia, and accordingly sent Eight thousand Men to lay Siege to the Fortress of Duare.Duare be∣sieged and relieved. The Place defending it self with great Re∣solution, gave time and opportunity to the Generals, Valier and Michael, to come to its Relief; which they performed so effectu∣ally, that in less than an Hour's time the Turks were obliged to raise the Siege, with the loss of Two hundred and fifty Men kil∣led, and Seventy Prisoners taken; and on the Christians side no more than six were slain, and about thirty wounded. The Morlaques continued the Pursuit, and rou∣ted the Pasha of Bosna himself, who with a Body of Four thousand Horse was march∣ing towards Duare, to maintain the Siege. These were Preludes to greater Matters, which were then acting by the Venetian Fleet, and gross of the Army under the au∣spicious Conduct of Francesco Morosini, Ca∣ptain General of the Venetian Forces both by Sea and Land: For the Fleet being compleatly equipp'd and furnished with all Necessaries, both for the Services of Land and Sea, joyned with the Gallies belong∣ing to the Pope, to Malta, and to the Duke of Florence; all which together composed a Fleet consisting of Five Galeasses, Thirty seven Gallies, Twelve Galleots,The Vene∣tian Fleet and Auxi∣liaries. Twelve Men of War, Four Petaches, Three Pinks, and Three Tartans; besides, Twenty two stout Ships of War, which triumphantly Sail∣ed into the Archipelago, under the Command of Alexander Molino, and Girolamo Delfin, two Noblemen of Venice. The Gallies of Tuscany were four, Commanded by Admiral Guidi, on which were Three hundred Land Soldiers, under Prior Vandomi. The Pope's Gallies were five in number, which carry∣ing no Flag, joyned to the eight Gallies of Malta, and composed one Squadron toge∣ther, under the Command of Prior Bran∣caccio, who had the Title of General, under whom was Cavalier Malaspina, Director of the Ecclesiastical Gallies: Upon the Pope's Gallies were Three hundred Land Soldiers; and on those of Malta were a Thousand, in∣cluding the Knights themselves, Command∣ed by their General Le Tour, who by ma∣ny brave Actions had signalized himself in the last famous Siege of the City of Candia. The other Land Forces, were Three thou∣sand Italians, One thousand Sclavonians, and about Two thousand Four hundred Germans, under Command of Prince Maximilian Wil∣liam of Brunswick; all which together made up Eight thousand Foot, besides Horse, and besides several Persons of Quality, who were Voluntiers, and amongst the rest Prince Philip of Savoy, a valiant and a generous Prince; all which Land-forces were Com∣manded by Count St. Paul, a General of great Ability and Experience, having for a long time served the King of Denmark and the Duke of Newburg. These Forces being joyned in the Port of Dragomestre, which was the Place appointed for their general Rendezvous; a Council of War was held, where it was resolved to Sail to Cape Sapienza, both to make a Diversion of the Turkish Forces, which in great numbers were assembled about Patras, and to con∣firm the Mainiotes to continue firm to the Venetians; but it seems their Successes were different to their first beginnings, for the Venetians having with drawn their Forces from them, they were over-powred by the Turks, and compelled to give Hostages for their future Faithfulness and Alliance to them. The Guard and Care of Santa Maura and Preveza, being committed to Giacomo Cor∣naro, Proveditor General of the Islands, the Fleet, as was agreed, sailed for the Waters of Sapienza, from whence a Messenger was dispatched to the Mainiotes, encouraging them once more to make a Defection from the Turks, which they promised to do in
despight of their late Agreement and Hosta∣ges given, being resolved upon any Terms whatsoever to free themselves from their Servitude to the Turks. In the mean time, a Council of War being called, it was put to the Question, Whether they should Be∣siege Modon,The Fleet Sails to Coron. Coron or Navarin; after some Debate thereupon, it was unanimously con∣cluded, that Coron should be the Place first to be invested, being the most feasible En∣terprise of any, and the most probable to succeed; and being nearest to the Maini∣otes, was the more commodious for keeping them firm and constant to the Republick: So soon as this Matter was resolved, the Fleet weighed Anchor, and steered their course directly to the Place. Coron des∣cribed.Coron is a Fortress situate in Messenia, one of the Provinces of the Morea; it is built in a triangular Form, after the ancient Fashi∣on, on a Promontory of Land, and is for∣tifyed with six Towers and a Castle. The Walls are high and thick, made of large square Stones; the lower Town is inhabi∣ted by Greeks and Jews, and the Castle by the Turks: It is distant about twelve Miles from Modon, which together with Coron, belonged anciently to the Venetians; but were taken from them by Bajazet, in the Year 1499: After which, Prince Doria of Genoua, Commander of the Spanish Fleet, retook it from the Turks in the Year 1533; and having left one Mendoza therein Go∣vernour, with a mean Garrison of Spani∣ards, it was in some few Years afterwards surrendred to the Turks, who knowing the Importance of the Place, have ever since that time conserved it in their Hands until this Year 1685. When on the 25th of June, the Captain General Morosini, in the Morn∣ing, landed his Forces almost within Can∣non-shot of the Place, without any Opposi∣tion from the Turks, and approach'd the Ci∣ty under the shelter of some Olive-trees. The Veneti∣ans land their Men, and open their Trenches.On the 26th they began to open the Trenches, and to streighten the Enemy on the side towards the Land: The Battalion of Malta, those of Brunswick, and the Pope's Forces, were posted on the Right-hand to∣wards the Sea, and the Venetians and Scla∣vonians on the Left towards a Suburb or Out-town, of which they made themselves Masters without opposition: The Works al∣so went forward without much Interruption; and two Batteries were raised, each of four great Pieces of Cannon, with four Mortars for Bombs. In the mean time the Captain General kept the Place blocked up by Sea, that no Relief or Succours could come to it; and dispeeded the Squadrons of Tuscany, with that under the Captain of the Gulf, to Cruise towards the Levant: And because the Tower of the Fort erected to the Sea, incommoded the Fleet, Order was given to Andrea Navager and Agustin Sagredo, the Captains of two Galeasses, with four prin∣cipal Gallies to approach near, and to Bat∣ter the Tower, which was performed with good Effect and great Execution. The Works were continued with great Industry and Labour, and the Compleating of them hastned with the more expedition, by rea∣son that News was brought to the Camp, that the Pasha of the Morea, with a Body of Three or Four thousand Horse and Foot were assembling together to raise the Siege; to oppose which with the more advantage, all the Olive-trees near the Town were cut down, and a large. Field and Campaign opened without any shelter for the Enemy. Notwithstanding which, they were much encouraged in the Town, by Letters pri∣vately conveyed therein, giving them hopes from the Pasha of speedy Relief; in expe∣ctation whereof, they returned an obstinate and a rugged Answer to the Summons which the Captain Pasha had sent them, signifying that the Fortress belonged to the Grand Seignior, which they were resolved to de∣fend, so long as one Stone thereof remained on the other. Nor were the Besieged there∣in deceived; for the Captain General by most certain Intelligence was informed, that in the parts near to Lepanto and Patras Three thousand Turks were got into a Body; and that some few Days before, Twelve hun∣dred were upon the March under Mustapha Pasha, and that the others commanded by Halin Pasha were following them with all ex∣pedition, and already on their March. On the 7th of July in the Morning, a considerable Body of Turks appeared about two Miles distant from the Trenches,The Turks march to? relieve the Place. ad∣vancing slowly and with Circumspection on their Way thither; the Number and Qua∣lity of which, (as was advised by a Jani∣sary, who was a Fugitive from the Enemy) were Five hundred Horse, One hundred Ja∣nisaries, Four hundred Segmen, besides Two hundred more who were supplied from Mo∣don, and gathered from the adjacent Villa∣ges, besides a Thousand more not far di∣stant; and the Three thousand Turks, who had lately mustered near Lepanto and Patras, were also on their March with the same Design of Relieving the Town. As these Forces advanced nearer to the Venetians, Skirmishes daily happened, in which the Turks were for the most part worsted; and in regard Siaus Pasha found himself much weaker than the Christians,Siaus Pa∣sha. be issued his Commands into all Parts near to Calamata and Misitra, and the Parts adjacent, requi∣ring them to send a Man out of every House, with Mattook and Shovel, to level the Ways, and render them more passable
and commodious for Transportation of Can∣non, which he intended to plant on a Bat∣tery, designed to annoy the Venetian For∣tifications: To Countermand which, the Chri∣stian Ingeniers projecting where to erect another Battery to offend that which the Turks were designing, raised one in a very short time, with three Pieces of Cannon on the highest Port, where the Forces of Bruns∣wick were lodged, which did great Execu∣tion, not only offending the new Battery of the Turks, but likewise the whole Camp. The Pasha being come up with all his Forces very near to the Venetian Leaguer, for∣tified himself with a good Retrenchment; and with the Battery he had raised of four Pieces of Cannon,The Pasha of the Mo∣rea fortifies his Camp. he plaid cross-wise, which much incommoded the Christian Camp, and the two Armies lying so near each to the other, it was impossible but Alarums must be conti∣nually given on both sides, and daily Skirmi∣shes must happen with various Successes. The Besieged being herewith encouraged, re∣doubled their Fire, and seemed neither to fear Assaults, nor the Springing of Mines, which being to be penetrated through a hard Rock, took up no less than three Weeks time to perfect. The Fortifications of the Place, thô much ruin'd by the Batteries, and much Damage caused by the Bombs, yet the Situation thereof was advantageous, being placed on a Rock, flanked with great Towers, defended with eighty Pieces of Cannon, with store of Ammunition and Pro∣vision of all sorts, and a good Garrison within of Eight hundred Men, besides ma∣ny others fit to bear Arms; it seemed im∣possible to become Masters of the Town, but by opening a wide Breach with Batte∣ries and Mines, entring thereat with a vi∣gorous Assault; during which they were to expect an Attack from the Turkish Army, which lay near them, and in a manner Be∣sieged them. This posture of Affairs gave some Trou∣ble to the Christian Generals, in what man∣ner to offend the one, and at the same time to defend from the other; for the Mines were all ready, one under the great Tow∣er,Mines pre∣pared. contrived and mannaged by the directi∣on of the Ingenier Bassignani; and the other opposite unto it, near the Attack of Brun∣swick and Malta by Ingenier Verneda. And now to put these Matters in Execution, the Captain General Morosini came on shoar, and having called a Council of War, it was thereat agreed, That the Day following be∣ing the 24th of July, a general Assault should be made, and the Mine of Verneda should in the first place be fired: All things were accordingly prepared; Segres a Knight of Malta, was to begin the Assault at the head of Sixty Granadiers, seconded by a Detach∣ment of Fuseliers and Sclavonians: La Barre Lieutenant General of the Battalion of Mal∣ta, was to follow the Chevalier de Refuge,Orders for an Assault. at the head of the Pope's and Venetian For∣ces; these were to be seconded by the Prince of Brunswick, with a Hundred and thirty Men, and afterwards followed by Monsieur de la Tour Maubeuge, General of Malta, with a Body of Knights carrying the Standard of that Order. All things being thus pre∣pared and ordered, the Mine charged with a Hundred Barrels of Powder was fired, which threw up some of the Earth, and part of the Wall, but had not force sufficient to move the Rock, but recoyled and vented it self another way. The Turks taking this to be the Signal for an Assault, immediately invested the Redoubt and Battery, which (as we have said) was erected on a certain Eminence of rising Ground for security of the Lines, and stormed it so vigorously,The Turks take a For from the Venetians. that the Venetians and Sclavonians, who had the Defence thereof, were forced to give way and quit the Station, and the Turks re∣maining Masters thereof, planted twenty of their Colours thereon, to the great Encou∣ragement of the Besieged. Monsieur de la Tour, who with his Knights was posted nearest to the Redoubt, considering that the Turks could not be permitted to remain in Possession thereof without great Annoyance to the whole Camp; and that the same was not to be recovered without some extraor∣dinary and signal Action; he without farther delay, called his Men about him, and with much Hast and Bravery, which was natural to him, advanced towards the Enemy, and was the first who leaped into the Redoubt, and with his own Hand killed two Turks; who opposed him; a third coming behind him, threw off a light Helmet which he wore, and gave him a cut over the Head with his Cymeter, with which he fell to the Ground; and having received two other Wounds, from whence much Blood issued,La Tou killed, his Companions designed to have carried him off, but were prevented by a Barrel of Powder, which accidently taking fire, car∣ried him nearer towards Heaven, a Place designed for him in Reward of his Religion and Vertues. He was followed close by se∣veral Knights, namely, by de Termes,with many other Knights of Malta. a most valiant Person, who was also slain, as was Mi∣chon by a Musquet-shot: Gramont received two Wounds with a Cymeter and a Musquet-shot; Bourgon, de Galliard, & de la Motte, were mor∣tally wounded, besides many others, who so signalized themselves in this Action, that they drove the Enemy headlong from the Redoubt,They regain the Fort. took eleven of their Colours, and in place thereof planted the Standard of the Order of Malta, at the sight whereof all the Army with a loud shout cried, Viva Malta, or
May Malta live. The Venetians and Sclavoni∣ans, animated with this Success returned to their wonted Courage, and killed Three hun∣dred Turks, who had lodged themselves in the Redoubt, suffering none of them to Escape. The Fight being ended, the Vene∣tians exposed the Banners they had taken from the Enemy, with One hundred and thirty Heads in view of the Besieged, who being nothing affrighted herewith conti∣nued still with much Valour and Resoluti∣on to maintain their Fortress. The Death of General de la Tour, was lamented by all the Army, and especially by the Captain General Morosini: His Funeral Rites were celebrated with all the decency, and cere∣mony belonging to a Commander, whose Merits and Valour had made a deep Impres∣sion in the Minds of his Soldiery; for the Sweetness of his Temper, with his modest and engaging Deportment, had made his Conversation agreeable to all that knew him. His Heart and Bones were Embalm'd, to be carried to Malta, where afterwards they were Interr'd. The Cavalier de la Barre being the next in place, was preferr'd to his Command of the Battalion, a Person qualified in all respects to succeed so worthy a Predecessour, having acquired a general esteem by the bravery of his Actions, and long experience in the War. Notwithstanding the repulse which the Turks had received from the Redoubt, they returned again to make fresh Attempts up∣on the Lines, and with redoubled Force, having their Cymeters in their Hands they cast themselves once more into the Fort,The brave∣ry of the Forces of Malta. which was calld St. John's Fort, by reason that it had been preserved by the Valour of those Knights, who had the good Fortune to drive them once more from thence; by which and several other Actions of Chival∣ry, they became so formidable to the Turks, that they would Fly before them, so soon, as they saw the Standard of St. John ad∣vance. The Mine of Verneda, having (as we have said) recoyled without much ef∣fect; Considerations were had of Firing the other of Basignani, charged with Two hun∣dred Barrels of Powder, and thereupon to proceed to a General Assault: But in re∣guard the Turks in the Camp, who were now grown to Six thousand Men, were ready on such an occasion, immediately to fall upon the Assailants; it was agreed as absolutely necessary to give them Battle, and drive them out of their Works, before it could be safe, or possible to Storm the Breaches. Whilst these Matters were under Consi∣deration, two of the Rulers of the Maini∣otes, or grave Councellors (called by them Vecchiardi) happily came to the Captain General on the 5th of August, to offer to him in the name of their People a Recruit of Fifteen hundred Men,Aug. which were kind∣ly accepted, and the Messengers treated with all imaginable Civility, and the next Day the Captain of the Gulf, with four Gal∣lies was sent to Transport them to the Camp. In the mean time, the Turks daily receiving new Recruits and Refreshments, from divers parts of the Morea, infested con∣tinually the Christans in their Works: The Defendants also let down small Parties by Night from the Walls of the Town, who covering them under the Rocks, and in Holes, Fired upon the Guards; and being good Marks-men, and shooting with Art,The Vene∣tians an∣noyed in their Tren∣ches. sel∣dom missed the Man they aimed at; and being nimble and active Men, skipt over the Rocks and made their Escape. By Night they threw their Artificial Fires from the Walls into the Trenches, which easily sei∣zed the Beams and Coverings, made of Olive-tree and Rafters of old Houses, taken from a Neighbouring Village, which burned so impetuously, that with great difficulty the Fire was quenched; in doing which the Christians were exposed to the small Shot from the Walls, which by the light of the Fire they poured upon them. Their num∣bers thus daily decreasing by those who were Slain, Sick and Wounded, there seem∣ed a kind of necessity of performing speedi∣ly some considerable Feat of Arms, before they languished, and consumed away in their Trenches; and before the new Re-in∣forcements were come from the Captain Pasha; who, as it was said, was already arrived with his Fleet in some part of the Morea. This Council being agreed, as ne∣cessary by all the Chief Officers;An attempt resolved on the Tur∣kish Camp. The Cap∣tain General selected out of the Venetain Gallies and Galliots Fifteen hundred Le∣vents, or Soldiers belonging to the Fleet, who were stout and robust Fellows, under Command of Lieutenant Colonel Magnanin, whom he commanded silently to Land after Mid-night; Twelve hundred whereof were to take their way towards the Enemies Trenches on the left Hand, at the opening into a Vally, and the remaining Three hun∣dred to the right Hand; and to confound the Enemy the more, the Fleet was ordered to weigh Anchor, and move from their usual Station. At the same time Three thousand choise Soldiers under command of General St. Paul, were appointed to march out of their Line; and on the 7th of August by break of day in the Morning to Attack the Enemy in their Trenches, who were more numerous in their Men than the Chri∣stians, and had much the advantage over them by their Horse. All things were pun∣ctually observed, and executed according∣ly;
And on the 7th Day, with the dawn∣ing of the Morning, the Signal was given by Firing two Barrels of Powder under the Breach, which was immediately followed by all the Cannon of the Fleet and Camp; and with such thick Vollies of small shot in the Front from the Three thousand Men, which had Sallied out of the Line, and from the Levents, who had placed themselves both in the Rear and Flank; that the Enemy be∣lieving the Venetian Camp to be much aug∣mented by the accession of the Mainiotes,The Turks defeated. and other Auxiliaries, affrighted with a panick fear, put themselves generally to Flight: Those who were more couragious and stood the Brunt, were not able to resist long, but either were beaten, and trampled down by their Fellows, or killed by the Venetians, who pursued the Flying Enemy, as far as they could without Horse, leaving the Ground cover'd with dead Bodies and with Blood. This Victory was the more remarkable, because it was obtained on the 7th of Au∣gust, which was the same Day of the past Year, on which Santa Maura was taken. The Booty was very considerable; for be∣sides the Artillery, Arms and Ammunition of all sorts,The Booty taken. with store of Provisions, the Turks left Three hundred Horse behind them, which they had not time to mount with their Tents and Colours, and two Horse Tails, which are the Ensigns of Siaus Pasha, who also fell in this Action: All the Artil∣lery was taken, amongst which were six Pieces of Brass Cannon, three whereof were marked with the Arms of the Republick. The Day following the Captain of the Gulf emploied (as we have said) to bring Fifteen hundred Mainiotes to the Camp, arrived with Three hundred only: And on the 9th, the Commander in chief of the Forces belonging to the great Duke of Tos∣cany, alledging that the Term of his Com∣mission was expir'd, and that he was not authorized to remain longer at the Siege, he was licensed by the Captain General to depart, and a Farewel taken with all expres∣sions of kindness and civility. And now to complete and consummate these Successes by taking the Fortress, which was the chief and principal design of this Campaign; all industry and care was used to clear the Pas∣sage of the Rocks, Rubbish and other im∣pediments which lay in the Way, on the side of the Attack of Brunswick and Malta.Prepara∣tions for a new As∣sault. And on the other side towards the Venetian Attack, to lay open, and widen the princi∣pal of the three Chambers of the Gallery, which was formed by the Engenier Bassig∣nani, and thereby to make an entrance so far, as was possible undr the chief Bul∣wark: This work was so industriously carried on, that on the 10th of this Month of August the Mine was finished, and charg∣ed with Two hundred and fifty Barrels of Powder, which were found in the Turkish Camp. And that Evening at a Council of War, at which the Captain General, and all the principal Officers were present, it was agreed next Morning by break of day to give Fire to the Mine and make a Ge∣neral Assault:Aug. 11th. Accordingly on the 11th the Troops being drawn into Battalia, the Mine was fired, which had it's due effect, overthrowing the Bulwark,A Mine sprung. and widening the Breach, and blowing up all the Garri∣son which defended that part, into the Air, and not without hurt to many of the Vene∣tian Soldiers, who were nearest to the Mine, and ready to second the Mine with an Assault. So soon as the Blow was given, the Ita∣lian Troops commanded by Serjeant Major Jovij, with much Courage and Resolution proceeded to the Assault,An Attack on the Ve∣netian side. in the Front of which was Captain Marco Ferri, a Person who had greatly signalized himself at the Siege of Candia; and from thence, and from o∣ther places had brought many Scars and Wounds, which were so many Signs and Marks of Honour. The Assailants were received with Bravery by the Defendants: Howsoever, an opportunity was given them to Enter the City at that time, had they not instead of improving the advantage, con∣tented themselves with a Lodgment on the Breach. At the same time, so soon as the noise of the Mine was heard,An Attack on the side of Malta. the Forces of Malta, who were at the Head of the other Attack, seconded by the Pope's, and those of Brunswick, with great Vigour gained the Top of the Breach, which had been some Days open, thô it was of very difficult ac∣cess, and had been repair'd in some manner by the Defendants: Here now began a very furious Fight, in which the Knights behaved themselves with as much Man∣hood, and Prowess as became their Order, endeavouring to force the Retrenchment; but it being well Flank'd and furnished with Artillery, they fired so terribly upon them, that four of them were killed on the place, and above thirty wounded. The Cavalier de la Barre, who commanded that Battalion, beha∣ved himself with all the Courage imagina∣ble, and thô seconded with like Resolution by the Pope's Officers, and those of Brunswick, yet they were repulsed and forced to Re∣tire. But the Knights having heard how great a Breach the Venetian Mine had made, they resolved to give a fresh Assault in the Af∣ternoon; and in the mean time the Levents were Landed from the Galiots, to give bet∣ter Countenance to this Enterprise. All things being prepared accordingly, and the
Troops Marching out of their Lines to at∣tempt the ultimate Assault, gave the Be∣sieged cause to believe,A Parly offered. that it was not pos∣sible longer to resist, their Commander in Chief with many others of their principal Officers being buried in the Ruins; they spread a White Flag in token of a Parly. The General St. Paul upon sight hereof, gave a stop to the Assault; but the Captain General refused to accept any Treaty, un∣less the main Tower were in the first place delivered into their Hands. But whilst they were Capitulating on this Preliminary, it unfortunately happened out, that two Sol∣diers quarrelling together a Pistol was shot off, and the Bandeliers of another Soldier took Fire, which gave such an Alarum to the Besieged, that they cryed out Treache∣ry, and therewith fired one of their Cannon planted at the entrance of the Breach, la∣den with small shot, which killed several that were mounted thereon:Coron ta∣ken by Storm. This Accident was sufficient to put an end to the Treaty, and incense the Soldiery, who transported with Fury, broke into the middle of the Town, and with miserable slaughter put Men, Women and Children to the Sword, without any respect either to Age, or Sex. Thus ended the Siege of Coron, on the 11th of August, which was Seven and forty Days after the Trenches were opened. It was a Bloody Day to both sides. The Chri∣stians lost about Three hundred Men, but the Turks near Three thousand; all the In∣habitants, as well as the Soldiery being miserably slaughter'd, and the Town com∣mitted to the Plunder and Pillage of the Sol∣diery. After which Te Deum being Sung, with other Hymns of Praises, and Thanks to Almighty God, the Captain General em∣braced all the Chief Officers with much af∣fection and kindness, as namely the two Princes of Brunswick and Savoy, and all the others in their several Degrees: He declar'd, That Count St. Paul with his Venetians had gained much Honour; That the young Count of Brunswick had signalized himself in a particular manner; That the Forces of Florence had given good proofs of their Valour, to the time of their Departure, which was some Days before the end of the Siege. That the Battalion of Malta, which were always joyned with the Pope's Forces deserved immortal Glory, as did all the Knights, who so bravely had sacrificed their Lives in defence of the Christian Faith; and that the Cavalier de la Barre, by many brave Actions had maintained the the same Honour which de la Tour had gained. He also particularly applauded the two Sergeant-Majors of Battalia, Jovii and Alcenago, the Marquis of Corbon, Colonel of Dragoons, with the Ingenier Bassignani, on whom he bestowed a Gold-chain and a Medal in Reward of the great Service he had done,Morosini applauds the Vlour of his Offi∣cers. by well contriving and fortifying the Mine, which gave the ultimate and fatal Blow to the Town. In fine, he bestowed due Praises and Commendations on the in∣ferior Officers and common Soldiers, amongst whom the Booty of the Town being di∣stributed, every one remained entirely sa∣tisfied. In the Town and Fortress thereof were an Hundred twenty eight Pieces of Can∣non, of which Seventy were of Brass, of which, some were buried in the Ruins; in digging for which, there was a Stone found with this Inscription: Hoc opus fieri fecerunt Magnifici Et Clarissimi D. D. Bernardus Donato Castellanus Et Ludovicus Contareno Capitaneus Et Provisores Coroni M.CCCCLXIII. Before the Departure of the Captain Gene∣ral, the Government of this important Place was committed to the Care of Georgio Benzon, to be Proveditor in extraordinary, and to Justin de Riva in ordinary. The Super-intendency over the Arms was com∣mitted to Count Alexander Vimes, and his Brother was declared Governour. The Siege of Coron being thus honoura∣bly concluded, the Prior Brancaccio, Gene∣ral of Malta, and the Cavalier Malaspina Antiano, Commander of the Pope's Gallies,The Pope's Gallies, and those of Malta re∣turn home. declared, that the time allotted them for their continuance Abroad by Commission and Instruction being expired, they desired leave to return to their respective Countries. The Captain General, who was desirous to add one brave Action more to the Glories of this Campaign, shewed himself unwilling to lose so good Company, and so great a Diminution of his Forces, instantly desired their Aid and Assistance for prosecution of a farther Design; but they urging that the term of their Commissions was already ex∣pired, and therefore against their own Incli∣nations, they were obliged to depart, and more-especially that their Forces were more than half diminished, and most of their Knights either killed, sick, or wounded, they at length prevailed with the Captain-General to grant them a Release; from whom having received the Visits and Complements of Farewel, they set Sail on the 22d of August at Night; with whom also departed Ge∣neral St. Paul, a Person very aged, and ty∣red
with the Toils of the Campaign, had License given him to ease himself in the Island of Zant, as also to the Colonel his Son, who had for some time laboured under the Indispositions of a malignant Fever. The Captain Pasha having received In∣telligence of the loss of Coron, sailed with his Fleet of Gallies in sight of Cerigo, hoping thereby to divert the Venetians from at∣tempting farther any Design for that Year: But this Sally was only in Bravade, rather than in earnest; for the Venetians were be∣come so terrible to them by the late Suc∣cesses, that the Captain Pasha with fear re∣tired into the Port of Napoli di Romania,The Captain Pasha re∣tires to Na∣poli de Ro∣mania. where, so soon as he was entred, he drew the Chain cross the Mouth of the Harbour for Security of his Gallies, and landed the most choise and select Men of his Militia on the Shoar; where he formed a Camp, as well to receive the scattered and dis-spirited Troops, which were fled from before Coron, as to give Life and Courage to the affright∣ed People of those Provinces, and restrain the Mainiotes from their intended defection from the Ottoman Empire; promising to re∣mit unto them all the Mony they owed for Charatch or Pole-mony, and to free and exempt them from all sorts of Taxes and Impositions for the three ensuing Years. This Captain Pasha was chief Favourite. The Captain General who was still at Co∣ron, repairing those Fortifications with great diligence, set Sail to the Coast of Zarnata, being recruited with the Forces of Saxony, which (as we have said) were lately arri∣ved in the Island of Corfu. ZarnataZarnata is a Fortress almost of a round Figure: It is naturally strong, being situate on a high Hill, but rendred much more consider∣able by Art. The Captain General sent a Detachment to Summon the Place, which began at the first Overture to entertain a Treaty; and thô the gross of the Venetian Army was not within five Miles of them, and had not as yet made any descent; and the Turkish Forces, under the Captain Pa∣sha, were much at the same distance from them: Howsoever, the Aga which govern'd the Place, whether out of fear or affection to the Christians, Surrender'd it at the first Demand on the 11th of September.is yielded. The Garrison, which consisted of Six hundred Men, was embarked, and guarded by a Convoy within a small distance from Cala∣mata; but the Aga fearing Death for his Cowardice or Treachery, remained in the Venetian Camp, where he was entertained by the Captain General with a Pension of Thirty Pieces of Eight a Month, after he had received Baptism, with Twenty other Turks, who were consenting to the Surren∣der. In this place were fifty one Pieces of Cannon, Two hundred Quintals of Pow∣der, with great store of Bullets, Ammuni∣tion, and other Provisions: After which, Seignior Morosini put into the Town Two hundred and fifty Foot Soldiers, under Com∣mand of the noble Venetians, Batholomeo Contareni and Angelo Emo. Whilst these things were acting, the Ca∣ptain Pasha, who was encamped about five Miles distant from Zarnata, with Seven thousand Foot and Three thousand Horse; upon News of the Surrender of the Fortress, withdrew his Forces under the Cannon of Calamata. This fear which the Turks shew∣ed, animated the Christians to adventure a Battle, without which, it was concluded at a Council of War, that nothing could be enterprised either towards Subjection of Calamata, or any other Town in the Maina; upon which Resolution the Venetians land∣ed their Forces on the Shoar of Agiasio, which is situate at the entrance of the Pro∣vince of Maina,The Vene∣tians land their Forces. a Place secure and advan∣tagious, having on the Right-hand Moun∣tains, on the Left Woods and Ditches, and on the Front several little Hills and Torrents of Water. So soon as some of the Venetian Troops appear'd on the Shoar, the Turks advanced to the tops of the Hills, on which they planted forty or fifty Colours or Ban∣ners, and about Five or Six hundred of their Horse placed themselves under the Hills in the Valley: To dislodge these, and secure their own Camp, the Venetians had raised two Batteries of three Pieces of Cannon each, at the appearance of which, both the Horse marched away, and the Colours were withdrawn. The Christians taking this for an Instance of the Enemies fear, the Captain General put his whole Army into Battalia, with the Troops of Saxony, conducted by General Deghenfelt, an old and experienced Commander, and marched towards the E∣nemy; and at the same time, about a Thousand Mainiotes flanked by Two hun∣dred Morlaques, appeared on the top of a Hill to the Right-hand. In this posture the Christians remained all Night, and the next Morning being the 14th of September, which was the Exaltation of the Holy Cross, the General gave Orders to the Army to move and attack the Enemy: But the Turks not thinking themselves safe under the Walls of Calamata, set fire to their Magazines, and quitted the Town, making a Retreat with some small Skirmishes, without much Da∣mage to one side or the other.The Captain Pasha put to Flight. This Re∣treat or Flight rather, was so shameful, that the Christians believed it at first to be some Stratagem, and were cautious either to pursue the Enemy, or enter the Town; but at length a Party of Sclavonians and Maini∣otes being commanded to advance to the
Town, they observed it to flame in diverse Places; for the Inhabitants finding them∣selves abandoned by the Captian Pasha, de∣spaired of all Relief, quitted the Town and set fire to their Houses: And thus did the Christian Army enter Calamata, without any opposition. The News of these Successes encouraged the Mainiotes that they repaired to the Venetian Camp in great numbers;Calamata taken, a Party of which was presently sent in pursuit of the Enemy. In the Castle were only found nine Pieces of Cannon, and those nailed and rendred unserviceable; the Am∣munition was equal to the Arms, and the Place of it self being esteemed inconsidera∣ble and unfit for a Garrison,And demo∣lished. was dismant∣led, and the Walls demolished. Calamata is situate on the River ancient∣ly called Pamissus, or Panissus, in the Pro∣vince of Belvedere, now Spirnazza: The Town is not environed by Walls, but de∣fended by a Castle, which was only tena∣ble against some present Incursion, and for that reason, both the Turks abandon'd it, and the Christians demolished it. After Calamata was taken, the Venetians seized on Porto Vitalo, in which were fifty Pieces of Cannon, ten of smaller Artillery, with store of Ammunition. After which the Captain General appearing before Chie∣lifa, the Garrison therein conceiving them∣selves in no Condition to make defence Sur∣render'd upon Articles.Chielifa Surren∣dered. Asan Pasha, who was Governour of that place, and of all the Province round, was the first to lead the way out of the Town, and being accom∣panied with a Thousand People, carried the Keys to the Admiral Gally; Three hundred and fifty of which were Transported to the Island of Cervi, with their Goods and Move∣ables. During this Summer Seignior Molino Com∣mander of Twenty Sail of Ships, employ∣ed (as we have said) to Cruise in the Ar∣chepelago,The Cap∣tain Pasha droven in∣to Rhodes. Chased the Captain Pasha from place to place, and at length drove him into Rhodes, where he secured himself and his Fleet, with a strong Chain drawn cross the Harbour, not daring to adventure a-broad, thô the Venetians came often to brave him, and challenge him to an Engagement. Thus ending this Campaign with great Reputation and Glory to the Venetian Arms,The Cap∣tain Gene∣al draws into Win∣ter-quar∣ters. the Captain General Morosini Sailed for Corfu, to take his Winter quarters there: The Troops of Brunswick were sent to Zant, those of Saxony with the Dragoons to Santa Maura, and other independent Re∣giments to Corfu, all due care being taken to make Provisions for their expected Guests. Whilst these Forces were drawn into their Winter-quarters, to enjoy some case after the labours of War; the Seignior Molino Captain extraordinary of the Ships, was appointed for a Guard to the Coast, and with his Squadron to Cruise near Cape Sapientia, and the Gulfs and Narrow Streights in those Seas. But before the Captain General thought sit to lay up his Fleet until the next Season in Corfu, he touched at Santa Maura and Prevesa, to take a View and Survey of the State of those Places; but in his way thither, accidentally putting into the Port of Gomenizze with some Gallies, he order'd the Proveditor with the rest of the Fleet to pass to the other side, and bestow a few Shot upon the Castle; which being done, some Troops were landed,The Vene∣tians take Gomeniz∣ze. and marched in Military form towards the Castle; upon sight of which the Turks were become so Cowardly and Timorous, that they fired one Gun and abandoned the Castle, and fled into the neighbouring Mountains and Woods for Refuge. So the Venetians took immediate Possession of the Fortress, in which were Twelve Pieces of Brass Can∣non. This place of it self was of no great con∣sideration; but in regard it was the Nest, and Sanctuary for Pyrates and Robbers, who in the times of Peace continually infe∣sted Corfu, Parga and Pazò, the News thereof was satisfactory and pleasing, to all the Inhabitants of that Coast: So that when the Captain General on the 13th of Novem∣ber enter'd into Corfu, he was there recei∣ved with loud Acclamations, extolling the Glory of his constant and continued Suc∣cesses, with joyful remembrance, and with particular Thanks for having reduced the Castle of Gomenizze, which had long been an ill Neighbour, and had much annoy'd and infested their Seas. Thus were the Affairs of the Turks ruin∣ous as well at Sea as at Land, in Hungary and in the Morea; the Pasha overthrown at Esseck was called Siaus, and so was the Captain Pasha, or Admiral of the Gallies,A Chara∣cter of the Captain Pasha. as if there had been something of Misfor∣tune in the Name. Siaus, who was Admi∣ral of the Fleet had formerly been Mosaip, or Favourite, and in his younger Years being a comely Person, was much beloved by the Grand Seignior; he was always in his Pre∣sence, and ever had the Honour to be Fami∣liar with him in Conversation; to be Clo∣thed like his Master, and to Ride equal with him on the right Hand, which is the inferi∣our place with the Turks. But he that had always been educated in a Court, was up∣on the tryal found unfit, and unable to per∣form the Office of an Admiral at Sea; and therefore was order'd to leave the care and conduct of the Fleet to Mazzamama, so cal∣led because he had killed his Mother, but
he was a good Sea Officer, bred up in the Gallies from his youth,Mazzama∣ma takes the Com∣mand of the Turkish Fleet. and one of the Beys of the Archipelago, of which there are Twenty four in number, who are obliged to Arm, and Man their Gallies at their own Cost and Charge, having in Consideration thereof the Haratch or Pole-money of the Islands, setled on them for their Mainten∣ance. He was the Son of a Captain Pasha, killed by the English in Fight at Sea; for which cause he hath ever since declared his Hatred and Malice against our Nation: He was a very fat and corpulent Man, afflicted much with a Fistula in Ano, which he che∣rished by excessive Eating and a Sedentary Life, using no other Exercise than what he received by the motion of his Gally. Siaus Pasha being discharged from his Office of Admiral, was made Generalissimo of all the Land Forces in the Morea, but he was as unfit to Command an Army, as he was a Fleet; for he was no Soldier, nor of any experience in a Camp; and besides he was affected with an incurable Lameness in one of his Knees, whereby he could nei∣ther Walk, nor mount on Horse-back with∣out help. His Success was agreeable to his Abilities; for (as we have said) his For∣ces were defeated, his Kaya or Lieutenant killed, and he himself with difficulty esca∣ped. When the News of these ill Successes came from the Morea, Hungary and other parts, the Court at Adrianople used all ima∣ginable Arts to conceal the losses; the Cur∣riers were order'd to come privately by Night into the Town, and none durst to Cabal or Discourse of News,The Grand Vizier's Caution. which was the cause that nothing but Lies were whis∣per'd about the Town. Upon these Emer∣gences frequent Councils were held, at which the Mufti, Kadileschers, or Chief Justices, Reis Effendi, or Secretary of State, and Janizar-Aga, all firm and entire Friends to the Grand Vizier, were always present and assistant to him; by which unusual method of proceeding in this Court, he gave the World to understand, that acting nothing of himself, he was not to be blam∣ed or censur'd for the Success, or to be accountable for the miscarriages of the War. And whereas there were several Murmu∣ings amongst the People, and in the Army especially, against the Vizier for not going to the War; he publickly desired the Grand Seignior's leave and commands to go; to which when the Sultan seem'd inclinable, the Council unanimously opposed it, represent∣ing that it was never accustomary, nor de∣cent for the Emperor, to send his Represen∣tative with his Seal and Authority without a Royal Army, or without expectation of performing some Signal Enterprize: And that on any other Terms or Circumstances than these, his going would be Prejudical and Dishonourable: It was farther alledged,Excuses for not going to the War. That the attendance on the Vizier would consist of many useless Mouths, and the oc∣casion of business draw many Followers to his Court, who must necessarily consume a great part of those Provisions, which would be more usefully emploied for the use and sustenance of the Camp. But the best Excuse of all, was the ill state of the Vizier's health; concerning which there were various Reports; sometimes it was said, that he was desperately ill, then again that he was recover'd, then that he was re∣lapsed; some said, that he was Sick in Po∣licy, others in Reality; but what seemed most probable was, that he was afflicted with the Spleen, by reason of which all kind of ill News made a sensible alteration in him: The Cares which constantly tor∣mented him, kept his Mind always bent, and increased the pain in his Side, which kept him from Repose: These matters with Sixty six years of Age, were Afflictions sufficient to weary out, and harass a Body much more strong and robust than his. Thô formerly he had the Report, and that not without reason of a bad Man; yet after his being Vizier, his Comportment was with all Justice and Moderation; and thô na∣turally he was Passionate, yet striving with his Temper, he became mild and easie in his Conversation. Our English Nation in Turky were sensible of this great change of his Humour; for he became kind to them (which is extraordinary in a Turk) without other advantage to himself, than his usual and regular Presents. It was impossible,The ill state of the Turks. but that the whole Empire, even as far as to Basora, to Babylon or Bagdat, and the most remote parts of the East, should feel the dire effects of this unfortunate War; little Money was stirring and Trade interrupted, the want of which affects the Publick, as much or more than private Members. The Grand Seignior was forced at the beginning of the last Campaign, to disfurnish his Coffers in the Seraglio of all the ready Money in Cash; for the Riches there consists for the most part in Jewels and rich Furniture, rather than in Banks of Money: After which about the middle of the Summer, they ransacked the Treasury of the Stables, and took out from thence in Silver and Gold Stirrups, and other Horse-furniture, which they caused to be Coined with 30l. per Cent. Allay, to the value as was reported of Two thousand Pur∣ses, which made just a Million of Dollars. Misfortunes and Scarcity made the Soldiers mutinous upon every small occasion, and a∣verse from going to the War: The Lord Trea∣surer
was removed from his Office, and made Pasha of Damascus, and sent to sup∣ply the place, and charge of Siaus Pasha killed at Esseck, and order'd to repair the Bridge and defend that Pass: A Party of about Two thousand five hundred Spahees then at Adrianople, were commanded to fol∣low him upon this Expedition.A Mutiny amongst the Spahees. But Five hundred of these, withdrawing themselves from the rest demanded their Pay, and re∣fused to March; saying, That by the ori∣ginal constitution of their Order, they were not obliged to go to the War, but with the Vizier, or Standard of the Prophet, which it was their Profession and Office, to Guard and Defend. But to give a stop to this Se∣dition, and Nip it in the Bud, the Vizier immediately sent his Kaiah with all his Re∣tinue, and Janizar-Aga to the place where they were assembled, not far distant from the City; Twenty of them were taken and sent to the Grand Seignior, who caused four of their Heads to be cut off, and the other Sixteen were sent to the Gallies; and two of their Chief Officers were Banished to Cyprus, for keeping no better Order amongst their Men; all the rest were dispersed, and in an hour's time the whole Business was over; and in a few Days afterwards, those who were banished, and those who were sent to the Gallies were recalled and restor'd to their places, and all of them contented∣ly, and in good order marched towards Hungary. But they had not proceeded far on their way before advices came, that af∣ter Ibrahim Pasha's defeat near Strigonium, there had arose differences and disturban∣ces between the Spahees and Janisaries, to suppress which Ibrahim had cut off several of them: Whereupon it being not thought fit to suffer these Mutinous Spahees, to joyn with the discontented Parties, a stop was put to their March; until such time as Agiemzade, a grave and wise Person, one who had formerly been Reis Effendi, or Secretary of State, was sent to the Army in Hungary, with a Sum of Money to ap∣pease the Mutinies, and soften the Minds of the Soldiery. These little disturbances caused the People to talk, and brought the Vizier's name upon their Tongues: And those who pretended to be Politicians dis∣coursed, That this Empire had been raised, and supported by the Soldiery; and that from them deserving Persons had been pro∣moted, and advanced to the high Degrees of Viziers and Generals; and not from Parasites and Syphcoants, or from effeminate Courtiers and Favourites: And that the Grand Seignior, who diverted himself whol∣ly in Hunting and with Women, neglecting the main concernments of the Empire was not like his Progenitors, who in Person marched at the Head of their Armies, and encouraged their Soldiers by their Presence and Personal Valour: From such Discourses as these amongst the Commonalty, who reported much worse of their Affairs, than perhaps they were in reality, we may ex∣pect some greater Changes for the ensuing Years: For the Army was become Cow∣ardly and Mutinous, and running from the War more willingly than coming to it; and the Common People affected with a strange Superstition, that Fortune will change with exchange of Officers. But before we put an end to this Year 1685, let us a little return once more into Hungary, and take a view of what was acting in the Upper parts of that Kingdom; where the Success of the Imperial Arms had produced such Dread and Terrour in the Minds of Turks and Malecontents, that many places yielded at the first Summons, or at the appearance of an Army before them: In this manner Potak, Regentz,Several places be∣longing to Tekeli sur∣render. Ungwar and Serau, all Garrisons belonging to Tekeli, yielded without one Blow, and received the Imperial Troops, which being welcom'd with real Joy by the Inhabitants, the Mi∣litary Parol was maintained, and not the least injury or damage offer'd to the People. The Surrender of these Places were leading Cards to Senetz, Valdachin, and to the Castles of Sonna, Annoin, Pallotz, Duron, Spadiz, Joram, Hinghen, Zatmar and other places, which submitted to Count Caprara, and wil∣lingly received German Garrisons, and being pardon'd and absolved from their Rebellion by this General, they took a new Oath of Fidelity and Allegiance to the Emperor. But that which chiefly facilitated the de∣fection of these Places, was a report that Tekeli was seized by the Turks, and lay chained at Waradin; the Fame of which had some Foundation; for the Seraskier Shitan Ibrahim having had very ill Success the last Summer,Tekeli in Disgrace. knew not where to charge the Fault, and excuse himself better than by laying all the blame upon Tekeli; and to evidence his Resentment, caused him to be imprisoned at Waradin, until his Crimes were notified to the Court, and Orders gi∣ven by the Grand Seignior for his Punish∣ment. But Tekeli by his Agents had so well mannaged his Cause before the Divan, that he was fairly acquitted from all Blame, and the Seraskier disgraced for his rash Judg∣ment, as will hereafter be discoursed more at large:And recei∣ved to ∣vour. And indeed the Grand Seignior and his Council did wisely consider the great Interest of Tekeli in Hungary, and what Influence his present Disgrace had al∣ready had over the many Towns and Castles which belonged to him, and which had Sur∣render'd upon the Report only of the Im∣prisonment
of their Prince; wherefore the Grand Seignior and his Council hasten'd, with all possible speed, Orders to the Pasha of Waradin for his Release, and at the head of his Army to proclaim his Innocence, and repair his Honour; the which was accord∣ingly performed, as appears by a Letter from Tekeli himself, dated the 4th of De∣cember 1685, from Alba Regalis, directed to his Wife, the Princess of Ragotzki, where∣in also he signified his Intentions to return with the Spring into Hungary, with a Body of Fifteen thousand Turks and Tartars, and endeavour to recover those Places which were revolted from him. These Advices so encouraged the Princess, that she bravely refused to receive an Imperial Garrison into Mongatz, thô her Town was blocked up by Count Caprara during the whole Winter, of which we shall speak more at large at the beginning of the ensuing Year; and we shall conclude this, with the taking of Arad by Colonel Heusler, a Place situate upon the Banks of the River Maroz, between Temes∣war and Giulia, distant twelve Leagues from Temeswar, and about as far from Si∣geth. Heusler being not far from Arad, de∣tached a Party of Hungarians before, to provoke the Janisaries, and draw them for∣wards to an Engagement:Arad ta∣ken. Upon sight of the Enemy, the Janisaries made a Sally, supported with Fifteen hundred Spahees, Commanded by the Pasha of Soffia, which were newly come thither from Constantino∣ple: These Forces in the vigour and brisk∣ness of their Courage, pursued the Hunga∣rians, who made an orderly Retreat until they came to their main Body, at which the Pasha nothing dismayed charged with much Bravery; but Colonel Mercy coming up with his Germans, fell in upon them with such fury, that the Turks in a confusion and disorder endeavoured to make their Escape by flight into Arad; but were so closely pursued at the heels by the Germans and Hungarians, that they entred into the Town in mixture with the Turks, killing and de∣stroying them with such a Slaughter, that a Thousand of them, together with the Pasha, were slain at the Gates and within the Town, which remained a rich Booty and Prize to the Conquerors; for these Spahees lately come from their Homes, were well furnished with Mony, scarce any of them had less about him than Two hundred Hun∣garian Ducats in Gold, with good Vests of fine Cloth, well lined with Sables or other Furrs, and their Horses of the best Breed of Asia,A rich Booty taken at Arad. well adorned with the Accouter∣ments belonging to them, all which became a Prey to the victorious Army; besides, the Town was well supplied with all sorts of Provisions in great abundance, with which the Soldiers refreshed themselves,  and for the space of four Days sacked, plunder'd and welter'd in all sorts of Bestiality and Debauchery; at the end of which, they set fire to the Town, and in a few hours reduced all to Ashes. Those few Turks who escaped the Slaughter fled to Temeswar, where∣upon, this News was so great a Conster∣nation, that the Pasha to prevent the like fate on his Town, thought fit to burn the Suburbs, to the great damage and ruine of the Inhabitants. We have formerly mentioned, that the ill Success of the Turks in Hungary had caused Mutinies in the Army, and that one Arem∣zade, a grave and wise Person, was sent with a Sum of Mony to appease the Sol∣diery, and enquire into the Cause of these Disturbances: The Matter being examined, a Report was made much to the Prejudice of Shaitan Ibrahim, by reason of the disaf∣fection of the Soldiers and Commanders to him; for it seems impossible for a General to be unfortunate and beloved: When the Report was come to the hands of the Grand Seignior, the Capelar-kiasee, or Master of the Ceremonies, was speedily dispatched, with a Command to take off the Head of Shai∣tan Ibraim, and to make Apti, then Pasha of Buda, Seraskier or General in his place, and Osman Pasha, Ogli Pasha of Buda; but Osman's Head was cut off by Ibrahim three Days before the Order came: In return for which,Shaitan I∣brahim put to Death. Shaitan Ibrahim's Head was brought to Adrianople the 6th of December. He had been in the greatest Employments of the Em∣pire for the space of forty Years, and render'd considerable and signal Services thereunto: One might have thought that his brave and valiant Defence of Buda, would have attoned for future Misfortunes; or that his Marri∣age with the Grand Seignior's Sister de∣ceas'd, and afterwards with his Aunt, would have been Interests sufficient for his Pro∣tection; but the Grand Vizier feared him, and therefore was willing to wreak upon him all the Misfortunes of an unhappy Campaign, laying it to his Charge, that he had converted the Soldiers Pay to his own Profit: And so he fell about the Eightieth Year of his Age, commiserated by all, and according to the Character we have former∣ly given of him, he might have deserved a milder Fate. And so we shall put an end to the Martial Enterprises, Wars and Confusi∣ons of the Year 1685. ANNO 1686. THE Grand Vizier being of a melan∣choly pensive Nature,The Grand Vizier's Distemper. and much af∣flicted with hypocondriacal Distempers, made his Thoughts more burdensom by suppressing
them, and not communicating his sad Ap∣prehensions to other Friends. At the Siege of Buda he was ill for the space of a Month; but when good News came, he recover'd again, and his political Disease had its cold and hot Fits, according to the changes and vicissitude of Times. About the end of the last Year, or beginning of this, Soliman Pa∣sha, who was General of the Army against Poland, had not only defended the Confines, but worsted the Poles, and returned to A∣drianople with much Applause; for it was now no less Glory for a General amongst the Turks to save his Army, and not be Overcome, than it was formerly to Con∣quer. This was the Fortune and Honour of Soliman, for having brought off his Ar∣my entire and unbroken; which was a piece of Service so highly esteemed,Soliman Pasha's re∣ception. that the Grand Vizier received him upon his arri∣val, with all Honour and Appearances of real Friendship, sending the Chiausbashee and Chaouses to conduct him to his Presence, where at the same time were the Mufti, the Generals of the Janisaries and Spahees, and other great Ministers of State assembled, and all congratulated the Honours and Glo∣ries he had acquired; which Ceremonies being ended, all these great Persons (except the Mufti) attended Soliman to the Seraglio, where the Grand Seignior received him with much Kindness, clothed him with a rich Vest of Sables, entertained him with a splendid Banquet, and presented him two Horses richly furnished: According to which Exam∣ple, as is accustomary, all the great Men made him their Presents; for whom the Sul∣tan will Favour, the inferior Officers are obliged to Honour. The next Day Soli∣man came to the Vizier's Palace, held a Divan, and acted all publick Business, and in the Mouths of the Commonalty, he was cried up for Vizier Azem. And thô what Soliman Pasha acted was only as an Assist∣ant or Coadjutor to the Vizier, during his Weakness and Infirmity; yet Soliman got so much ground in Esteem of the Sultan, and of the People, that the Vizier thought it time to rouze up his Spirits, and to act every thing by his own Person.The Grand Vizier jea∣lous of So∣liman. And to secure himself from the danger of being sup∣planted by so powerful a Rival, he addressed a Memorial to the Grand Seignior, where∣in he represented the Vertues and Abilities of Soliman in an eminent manner, that he was a faithful, experienced, and a fortunate Minister, and the only Person in the World fit and able to be General in Hungary, and to conduct an Army in this dangerous and difficult War. The Grand Seignior enter∣taining a like sense of the Abilities of Soli∣man, inclined thereunto, and would have gi∣ven him that Employment, had not some Accidents intervened to prevent it. For the Embrahor, or Master of the Horse, the Kuzlir Aga, or Eunuch of the Women, and the Sultana or Empress her self, being all Friends and Confidents to Soliman, advised him of the Plot, which might bring upon him the like Fate, which had befallen Shai∣tan Ibrahim; and that the best way to avoid it, would be to push at the Office of Vizier, and demand the Seal. Soliman encouraged by such powerful Abettors, boldly cast him∣self at the feet of the Grand Seignior, and told him, That he was ready to lay down his Life either at Home or in Hungary for the Service of him his Master, and sacrifice all to his Pleasure and Glory; but to go into Hungary without the Seal (which was with∣out the power of Vizier) would be of Pre∣judice and ill Consequence to the whole Empire, for which he alledged many Rea∣sons, and being an eloquent or a well-spo∣ken Man, was seconded by others, who represented the present Vizier to be a Per∣son infirm and unfit for War. The Grand Seignior was prevailed upon, and agreed to constitute Soliman his Vizier;Soliman made Vi∣zier. but the Exe∣cution thereof, at the desire of Soliman was deferred until next Morning; and in the mean time, the Matter was carried so se∣cretly, that the Vizier had no Intimation or Jealousie of the Resolution. Next Morn∣ing being the time, when the Pay of the Spahees was to be delivered out, Soliman came to the Vizier's Chamber, and pressed him very instantly, that since he was now in better Health, that he would be present at gi∣ving out the Pay unto the Spahees; and that in case he were wearied or uneasy, he would perform the remainder of the Trouble for him; but the Vizier excused himself, and would not come, but desired Soliman to take the trouble upon him of that Day's Office; which as he was performing, and had half done, the Bostangibashee to the Grand Seig∣nior, or he who is Master of the Wardrobe, came to the Vizier and demanded the Seal, shewing him a Warrant for it, under the Hand of the Grand Seignior: The Vizier was so struck with the Surprise, that he had scarce power and strength to put his trem∣bling Hand into his Bosom to give it to him; and Nature being weak in him, he fell in a Swoun, and so was left. So soon as Soliman had finished the giving out the Pay, a Capigibashee came to call him to the Grand Seignior, to whom being come, he had the Seal conferred upon him, with the Character of the Supream Vizier, and so was conducted to the publick Palace be∣longing to that Office; from whence the former Vizier, without other Ceremony or Warning, was in a moment removed, and being by his Servants put into a Coach,
was carried to a private House, and four Days afterwards was order'd to retire unto Constantinople, with a Pension of an Hundred and fifty Aspers a Day, which may be about eight Shillings English Mony. This Ibra∣him (for so we must now call him) having a House and Garden of his own upon the Bosphorus,The late Vizier sent to Con∣stantinople. obtained leave to retire thither, but not to go to Mecha, as he instantly de∣sired: But he had not long continued there, before a Command was issued to seize his Estate, which was executed early one Morn∣ing by the Janizar-Aga and Bostangibashee, who surrounded his House, the latter of which went in to him, and told him that he must go with him; Ibrahim apprehending that his End was near, asked him, If he came for his Head; and when he told him no, he could not believe him, until he had Sworn by his Law and by his Prophet; being herewith a little comforted, he was carried Prisoner to the Middle-gate of the Seraglio; in the mean time his House was rifled, and all his Servans and Pages of any fashion were taken into Custody, and Examined for better Discovery of his Estate. All the Mony found, did not amount unto more than Five thousand Purses, besides his Jew∣els, and his great Revenues in Lands and Houses.His Estate seized. Being thus stripped of all his E∣state, he was on the 18th of March put in∣to a Gally, and sent to Rhodes, there to remain a Prisoner in the Castle. Soliman Pasha, now Vizier, compassionating his Case, and not knowing how soon it might be his own turn, sent him Five thousand Dollars, with a Vest of Sables, and obtained a small Allowance for him from the Grand Seig∣nior. Nor was this Change only of the Vizier, but attended with others at the Court; for the Janizar-Aga, or General of the Janisa∣ries was put out, and one Hassan Aga, Lieu∣tenant General of the Janisaries at Buda was put in his stead:Changes of Officers in the Tur∣kish Court. Zulficar Aga a vast rich Man, one of the Pashas of the Bench, was sent to command in the place of Mu∣stapha, Brother to the late Vizier Kupriogli, who was recalled to Court and made Chi∣macam at Constantinople. Ahmet Pasha nam'd for Captain Pasha last Year, was made Se∣raskier, or General in Hungary, in the place of Shaitan Ibrahim, and Apti Pasha (whom we have formerly mentioned) was return'd again to his Province of Pasha of Buda. The Reis Effendi, or Secretary of State was displaced, the Reason not known, and that Office supplied by a Relation of the late Vizier's, who wrote his Letters for him, a raw and an unexperienced Man. The Mosaip was continued General in the Morea, and Missir-ogli was made Captain Pasha in the place of Mazzamama, to whom as we have said, the care of the Fleet was committed the last Summer. These were the Changes with which this Year began in the Ottoman Court, after which care was taken to Recruit the Army, and make all Warlike preparations in Hun∣gary, for which the new Vizier Solyman was preparing; and al the Court and People were full of hopes, and expectations of mighty Successes under the auspicious Con∣duct of Solyman, whose very Name had been Fortunate to the Turks. Tekeli (as we have mentioned before) be∣ing set at Liberty,Tekeli re∣ceives Aid from the Turks. and restored to his Com∣mand with Honour; received Money from the Vizier to Raise Two thousand Men, and was recommended by the Vizer to the new Seraskier, to give all the encourage∣ment and assistance he was able, that so he might once more try his Fortune in the Upper Hungary. Amongst the many ways and contrivan∣ces to raise Money, one was to discover the hidden Riches of the Imprisoned Vizier, for which, whilst they made diligent Search in his Seraglio, or Palace at Constantinople it came to be known, that Three hundred Purses belonging to the Vizier Kara Musta∣pha, who was Strangled at Belgrade, were found in a secret conveyance of the House, the Chimacam and Embrahore, or Master of the Horse, would be present at Sealing of the Baggs, and had counted out Two hundred, when it proving dark and late,The Viziers Palace Burnt. they deferr'd the remainder until the Day following; but that Night, by what Ac∣cident is not known, the Palace took Fire and was Burnt to the Ground. At Adrianople, where the Court resided, an Envoy arrived from Muscovy, and another from the General of the Cosacks, with Com∣plaints against the Tartars and Governour of Asac, a Fortress of the Turks on the Ta∣nais, for Incursions made upon them: The Muscovites remain'd until this time in su∣spence, whether to make War, or confirm a Peace with the Turks;Addresses to the Ot∣toman Court. but the Success of the Emperor, and the Provocations received from the Tartars, put that Business beyond all doubt, and brought the Muscovites into a League with the Emperor and Poland, as will shortly be made manifest by the Capi∣tulations between them. Amongst other Applications to the Ottoman Court, a new Ambassadour from France arrived at Adri∣anople, to assure the Sultan of his Master's Friendship, and his Resolution to stand Neuter in this present War: But the Turks, who rely not with much confidence on the Word and Stories of the French, gave them an ordinary Reception, without Favours, or any unsual Concessions, denying to them the Guardian-ship of the Holy Sepulcher at
Jerusalem, which had formerly been granted to them. This was the State of the Ottoman Court, in the beginning of this Year 1686; when Count Caprara kept the Town of Mongatz Blocked up, which is strongly fortified with a Castle, Situate on the River Turza, be∣tween Ungwar and Zatmar,Mongatz Blocked up. near the Moun∣tains. The place belonged to the Countess Tekeli, in right of her former Husband Prince Francis Ragotski; She was Daughter of Count Peter Serini, and Married to Tekeli, as we have formerly mentioned. Caprara having all the Winter his Quarters not far from Mongatz, sent frequent Messages to this Lady to Surrender the Town and Castle to the Emperor, promising in the name of his (Coesarean Majesty, to con∣serve both her self and her Son, in the same Condition of Greatness, and Estate as at present; adding thereunto many Comple∣ments, which are commonly given to a young and beautiful Lady. The expressi∣ons he made to her, were so full of tender∣ness and respect, that she could not refuse to return an Answer, agreeable to so much concernment as he testified for her; assur∣ing him, That nothing so grieved her, as to see herself embarked in a Cause against the Emperor; and that nothing could be so un∣easie to her and difficult to determin, in what manner she was to behave herself, between the Duty and Faith she owed to a Husband, and Allegiance to the most gentle and gra∣cious Prince of the Universe: But as to the Surrender of the Town and Castle, it was not in her Power, but depended entirely on the Secretary and Deputy of her Husband, who was there constituted Governour, with all the Riches and Wealth of the place; and that the Citizens and Chief Magistrates thereof, were joyned in the same Resoluti∣ons with him, to defend and maintain the Place to their utmost hazard of their Lives and Fortunes; and that herein they were the more encouraged, by Advices lately re∣ceived from Count Tekeli, whereby he not only gives them the good News of his Li∣berty, and the great Honours and Aids, which the Turks had bestowed upon him in recompence for the Affront, which the late Vizier had cast upon him; but promised them very speedily a Relief sufficient to drive their Enemies from their Doors, and at a distance from their Country, and would bring Rewards in his Hands for those, who should in the mean time remain true, and constant to his Interest. A Sally from the Town of Mongatz.Count Caprara rightly judging, that by such delays and excuses as these, the Prin∣cess intended only to gain time, and to il∣lude his designs, began to draw his Forces nearer, with a Train of Artillery, Mortars and other Engins proper for a Siege: But the Garrison nothing dismaid thereby, made a Sally with Six hundred Men, and gained a Redoubt which the Imperialists had raised near the lower Town, with the slaughter of Four hundred Souldiers therein; and ha∣ving taken out the Arms and Guns, they demolished the Fort, and rased it to the very Ground. Howsoever, Caprara having received a Recruit of Two thousand Men, possessed himself of a Post, whereby he hoped to bar the Town of the Water, which supplied both that and the Castle: But matters happened quite otherwise, for the Rains fell in such abundance, as filled the Cisterns with Water, which were anciently made to supply the wants of the Inhabi∣tants on such occasions. In the mean time Apafi Prince of Transil∣vania, labour'd with all his power to gain a Neutrality for himself between the Turks and the Emperor; by the first of which he was pressed with all imaginable instances, to serve in this War both with Men and Money, according to agreement and obli∣gations of his Investiture, when he received the Standard from the Sultan: And by the other, That is, by the Emperor he was threatned to declare himself either a Friend, or an Enemy, for that no sort of indiffer∣ency would be admitted in this Case: And the better to compel him thereunto, Count Caraffa advanced into his Country with Eight thousand Men, Two thousand where∣of were Hungarians, and took up their Quarters on the Frontiers of Transilvania, which was now in a Condition under such a Force rather to receive Laws, than to give them.Apafi de∣sires a Neu∣trality. The Prince Apafi being much incommoded by Quartering of Soldiers, dispatched three Agents to Vienna, to Treat of those matters, to which he was altogether averse in former times, and readily offer'd to give free Quarter to those Troops which were sent into his Country; but as to an open Declaration of nearer Alliance he de∣sired to be excused, considering that his Country was environed by the Turks, and their strongest Garrisons bordering on his Confines, so that until the Emperor had driven the Enemy at a farther distance, it could not be advisable for him to make a more publick Declaration. The City of Debrezin,Debrzin redeems it self from free Quar∣ter. Situate between Tokay and Great Waradin, is Populous and Rich, and had voluntarily desired to be received into Protection of his Imperial Majesty, after Zolnock and Cassovia had been reduced, having conserved themselves in a Neutrality during the late Revolutions of Hungary, without taking part in any En∣gagement with the Malecontents. This City I say, was received into Protection,
upon promise to maintain with free Quarter Five thousand Germans, and One thousand Hungarians; but finding themselves over∣burdened and harassed with Quartering these Soldiers, they agreed to pay Eighty thousand Florins per Month, for the space of six Months, in lieu of their free Quarter, by which Sum of Money they eased them∣selves from the inconvenience and insolence of Soldiers, as did also many parts of the upper Hungary, the main burden of Quar∣ters being cast upon the Counties bordering on Transilvania, which was of great relief to the Hereditary Countries. This Year began early with Action; for the Generals Mercy and Heusler having their Quarters at Zolnock, made frequent Incursi∣ons upon the Turks with great Success and Advantage: And having intelligence, that in Transilvania a Convoy of about an Hundred Wagons was providing laden, with Money, Ammunition and Provisions for the subsistence and relief of Buda, they made a Detachment of Five thousand choise Horse, with some Auxiliaries from Count Caprara, and order∣ed them to march towards Segedin, and to Way-lay them in their Passage over the River. Heusler being advanced about a League from Segedin, gave Orders to Peterhasi, with a strong Battalion to embosk himself within the Woods, which grew very thick in that Country; and when the Garrison of Sege∣din should Sally forth to the assistance of the Convoy, That he should then with his Battalion arise from the place of Conceal∣ment, and seize upon the Town, which might perhaps be left naked, and void of all defence. Matters did not in all things answer expectation; for the Convoy being Guarded with a strong party of Turkish Soldiers, they Fought with such Valour and Resolution,Heusler Attacks a Convoy of the Turks. that thô the Imperialists re∣main'd Masters of the Field, and of the Convoy; yet the Action cost so much Blood, that it could not properly be called a Victory; for a Victory may be too dearly bought, when it is purchased with the Lives of so many brave Men, as are not to be estimated by any advantage whatsoever: And so it happened now;The Victory dearly bought. for thô Three thousand Turks were killed on the place, yet they were not to be valued with the Blood of Two thousand Germans and Hun∣garians, all choise and select Men, who lay dead in the Field. But as it happens com∣monly amongst Soldiers, those who live and survive, have little sense or regard for such as are slain; unless that being made Mad, and more Furious by the death of their Companions, they breath nothing but Re∣venge; as did this remaining Party, which exasperated by the difficulty of the late Fight, fell upon the Lands of Seudin, Geset, Bahatz, and the Parts adjacent, or not far from the place of Battle, destroying and consuming all with Fire and Sword. The News of these Successes were not very pleasing at Vienna, where they esteemed the Victory too dearly obtained; and thô they publickly applauded the bravery and resolution of the Officers and Soldiers, yet in their private Councils, they could not but secretly blame the rashness of the Com∣manders. As all places in the upper Hungary were filled with Slaughter and Confusion; so no less Damage was caused in Croatia,Flouds of Water in Croatia. by the vast Flouds and Inundations, which for some time drowned all that Country, and carried away whole Towns and Familes, Castles and Provisions down the Torrent: And not only hinder'd all Commerce and Correspondence of one Town with another, but prevented the intended Incursions on the Enemy, destroy'd the Provisions neces∣sary for support of the Army, and super∣induced a grievous Famine over the whole Land. Count Nicolas Erdeody, who was then Ban or chief Commander at that time of Croatia, being much affected with the Common Calamity of his Country, assem∣bled a Convention of all the Estates at Za∣grabia, to consider of the said Condition and Desolation of their Province, where after divers Conferences, they concluded it necessary to represent unto the Emperor, the State and Condition of Croatia, and the Confines and Militia thereof, and how ne∣cessary it was to defend and guard those Frontiers, from the Forces then gathering between Belgrade and Esseck. Nor were these Advices ill grounded; for the Turkish Forces were daily on their march from Belgrade to the Bridge of Esseck, which they had received Commands to Repair and Defend, being the most important Pass of all Hungary. Apti Pasha now Seraskier, or General of the Turkish Army, was ex∣treamly diligent and active to provide e∣very thing necessary against the next Cam∣paign;The Seras∣kier Rein∣forces se∣veral Gar∣risons. and with admirable Sedulity, as well, as the shortness of time would ad∣mit, he succour'd all the Frontier Garri∣sons with Provisions, and reinforced Wara∣din, Agria, Segedin, Temiswar, Buda, Alba-Regalis and Kanisia with Recruits, and all necessary supplies, being places most ex∣posed to the Enemy; and such as might with Reason be believed, would all or some of them be attempted, and become the En∣terprise and Design of this Years Cam∣paign. This Apti Pasha, was a Man of some experience in the War, but being of a sower and morose Temper, was ill beloved by the Soldiery.
Tekeli being intent to Relieve his Coun∣tess and City of Mongatz, and raise the Siege which Caprara had laid, and now compleatly formed; departed from Great Waradin about the beginning of February, with Seventeen Standards, and took his march by way of Hongland into Transilva∣nia,Tekeli marches towards Mongatz. about two Leagues from Clausemberg, where understanding that several of his Troops, which the last Year had made a Defection from him, were Quarter'd in the Parts thereabouts, he hoped either to sur∣prize and cut them off, or else to regain them back to his Party; but these Hun∣garian Troops having advice of his near Ap∣proach, changed their Quarters, and march∣ed away to joyn with the Croatian Regi∣ments of Lodron, and six Companies of the Regiment of Spinola; of which Tekeli being advised he alter'd his design, and resolved to pass the Tibiscus, and march with all expedition towards Mongatz. This Motion of Tekeli Alarum'd all the Countries, and caused Caraffa to endeaver to Way-lay him, and take some convenient Post to inter∣cept him in his march; but Tekeli upon this intelligence directed his Course towards Giulia, to joyn with the new Pasha of that place, and to concert other Methods, in order to their future proceedings. In the mean time Caraffa not to remain idle, having a Force of Four thousand Germans and Three thou∣sand Hungarians, with four Pieces of Can∣non and four Mortars, sent to Summon the Fortress of St. Job, about three Leagues distant from Great Waradin, Situate in the middle of a great Marsh or Fen,The For∣tress of St. Job. which ren∣der'd it naturally very strong; and was form∣ed by Art in a Quadrangular Figure, encom∣passed by four Bulwarks, joyned by strong built Curtains, and encompassed by a very deep Ditch: Upon one side of this Fortress there is a great wide open place, in which many Houses are erected, and is called by the name of the Little City; which also is forti∣fied in the nature of a strong Palanca, encom∣passed with a convenient Ditch, by which it is joyned to that of the Castle, and hath communication therewith by a Draw-bridge: Notwithstanding the strength of this place, Caraffa invested it on the 9th of February,Invested by Caprara. raised his Batteries, threw Bombs and Fir'd instantly upon the Town, which was re∣returned in like manner from thence. But so it hapned by the Divine Providence, that one of the Bombs fell directly into a Tower in the middle of the Castle, where the Powder and Ammunition was conserved; with which all blowing up, not only tore and rent the Tower in Pieces, but shook the whole Castle and the neighbouring Town, and put all the Soldiers and Inha∣bitants into such amazement and consterna∣tion, that they knew not which way, nor how to apply themselves for their defence and safety. This fatal Blow gave advantage to the Christians to Attack the Fortress in three several places; for which when the Turks perceived, that preparations were making, they spread a white Flag on the Walls, and demanded Terms of Surrender, which were readily granted and allowed to the Garrison, and to all the Inhabitants to march forth with their Arms, with their Wives and Children, and with as much of their Baggage, as every person could carry. Possession being taken of the Gates and En∣trances by the German Soldiers, Six hun∣dred Turks of the Garrison marched out,And Sur∣rendered. besides Women and Children, which were according to the Faith given, safely con∣ducted within a League of Great Waradin; only an unlucky accident hapned, that as the Garrison passed forth, about Twelve Persons were discover'd amongst them, to have been Hungarian Christians, and such as had become Renegadoes, and denied the Faith of Christ: Upon the sight of which the Christian Soldiers became so scandali∣zed and incented, that forgetting the Capi∣tulations agreed, they violently seized upon them, with intention immediately to Hang them up, or by some other way to put them to Death as Apostates: This Busle caused great disturbance, and made the Turks to Cry aloud, that the Conditions and Articles of Surrender were broken: But the Officers applying themselves with their Authority, to restrain the Licentiousness of the Soldiery, the Tumult was appeased: After which due care and diligence being used to extinguish the Fire, which still raged both in the Town and Castle, it was at length overcome, and much of the Ammu∣nition and Provisions conserved; what Goods remained were given to the Soldiery. In the Castle were eight Pieces of Cannon, without other Arms; about Two hundred and seventy Christian Slaves were set at Liberty. The taking of this Place was esteemed of much importance, by Reason, that thereby the Counties of Zathmar and Zobolesch were freed of all Contributions, and the Towns and Boroughs in all Parts round, as far as Waradin were bridled and kept under some restraint, by a Garrison of an Hundred Musquetiers, and Two hundred Heydukes and a Hundred Hussars, which Count Caraffa had put into St. Job, which were esteemed sufficient to resist any sud∣dain Incursion of the Enemy until Relief came, which could not be long wanting from the neighbouring Places. In the mean time (as we have said) Count Caprara had drawn his Line of Circumval∣lation before Mongatz, and laid a formal
Siege: Against which, the Besieged want∣ing no resolution to defend themselves,Mongatz Besieged. fired continual Vollies of great and small shot: And on the 10th of March made a Sally to ruin the Batteries of the Imperi∣alists, but were vigorously repulsed with some loss: Thô not long afterwards they made an∣other Sally with more success,Sallies made. having over∣thrown a Battery, and made the Cannon un∣serviceable: But in regard the Defendants found by experience that frequent Sallies cost the Lives of many Soldiers, which they could ill spare, they resolved to con∣serve them selves within their Walls, on the Defensive part, without other hazards of offending the Enemy. On the other side, the Imperialists pressed forward with much Resolution, plaid with their Cannon on the Palanca, and threw Bombs and Carcasses into the Town; but what damage was done thereby was soon repair'd by the diligence of the Besieged, returning their Shot with fiery Bullets of a new invention, which did great execution within the Lines. This and other Successes, raised their Spirits with∣in the Town to a steddy defence; to secure which, the Princess Ragotzki imposed a new Oath of Fidelity on all the Souldiers, which they chearfully took, and to express their readiness thereunto, they fired all the great and small Shot round the Town, with resolute Protestations never to hearken unto any Offers or Conditions for Surrender of the Place: To confirm the Soldiery in this good Humour, it was noised in the Garri∣son, that there were sufficient Provisions in the Magazines, for the subsistence of a whole Year; that the Princess had received Letters from her Husband Tekeli assuring her, that he would very suddainly appear before the Town, with an Army sufficient to raise the Siege and restore their Liber∣ties,Reports of Tekeli's March. and reward all those, who had con∣tinued firm and constant in their Faith and Allegiance unto him. Nor was this Re∣port confined within the Walls of Mongatz, but it was spread over all the Imperial Camp, that Tekeli had joyned the Seras∣kier's Army, with a Force of Eight thou∣sand Turks and Tartars, and shortly resolved to attempt the raising of the Siege before Mongatz, and to Re-inforce the place with considerable Recruits. To prevent which, Count Caprara dispeeded General Piccolo∣mini, with a strong Detachment to joyn with Mercy, Caraffa and Heusler, and with united strength to oppose the Enemies pas∣sage, and watch some favourable oppor∣tunity to engage them: But the Report of the Turks numbers, and Tekeli's design soon vanished, there being no such apparent Force in the Field to give them opposition. In the mean time the Siege proceeded vi∣gorously, Bombs and Carcasses being daily fired and thrown into the Palanca and Ca∣stle; one of which fell into the very Room, where the Princess Ragotzki was at Dinner, which without any disorder, or affrightment of the Lady was soon extinguished. How∣soever, the Besiegers made such a Breach into the Palanca, that they lodged a strong Party upon the brink of the Ditch. The Besieged on the other side had raised a great Battery behind the Breach, which dismount∣ed several of the Imperialists Cannon, and made divers Retrenchments, and fired continually Bombs and Carcasses into the Lines, which often times did considerable execution. But when the Officers of the Garrison consider'd, that the only means to preserve the place, was to prevent the Draining of the two Ditches of the lower Town, which were extreamly deep, they cut a passage for several streams of Water, by secret and hidden Channels to fall into the Ditch, which being increased by the melting of Snow from the Mountains, and continual Flouds of Rain, which fell in that Season of the Year, the Ditches were not only filled, but the Earth made so soft and moist, that it was impossible to main∣tain their Works; so that Caprara could do nothing more than Batter the Town with his Cannon, and throw some Bombs and Carcasses with little or no Execution. In fine, the Season coming on for Action, which required an application to something more profitable and promising than this difficult Work;The Siege of Mongatz raised. the Siege was raised by Order of the Emperor about the end of April, after five Months had been unprofitable spent before that place. But before the great and most consider∣able Actions of the following Campaign began, there were certain Preparations or Preludes thereunto represented in Fights and Skirmishes between certain Parties detached from the main Bodies, in all which the Im∣perialists gained the Advantage, and some∣times had the fortune of a clear Victory: On the 14th of March, some Imperial Troops having their Winter-quarters in Croatia, routed Fifteen hundred Turks drawn up in open Field, and put them to flight; Achmet Aga their chief Commander was killed, and his Son taken Prisoner:Achmet Aga de∣feated. This Engagement happen'd near a little Town called Jalonne, which the Croats stormed, and took and pillaged it, and set at liberty Eight hundred Christian Slaves, of which Three hundred were in a condition to take up Arms. Another Detachment of Croats possessed themselves of the Castle of Clanitz, where they found a considerable Booty; as also of the Town of the great Cladussa, about four Leagues from Strediclo, from
whence they were enabled to make Incursi∣ons into the Territories of the Turks with∣out any opposition. April.About the beginning of this Month, o∣ther Detachments from the Garrison of Ve∣sprin, and Places in the Lower Hungary, took the Castle of Palotta, about two Leagues distant from Alba Regalis,Other Suc∣cesses. and put all to the Sword. About the end of this Month, Count Baragotzi with a Regiment of German Horse, and some Hungarian Troops, intended to surprize Tekeli in Gie∣na, a little Town belonging to the Turks; but the Design failed, Tekeli being retired a little before the coming of the Enemy: Howsoever his March was not altogether fruitless, for in his return he took forty Turks, whom he made Prisoners. The Turks on the other side, with Three thousand Horse and Foot, under the Com∣mand of Fonduck Pasha, designed to surprize Wirowitza in Croatia; but the Governour of that Place having notice thereof, got to∣gether about One thousand Seven hundred Horse and Dragoons from the neighbouring Garrisons, with which he surprised the Ene∣my in their Camp, before Day in the Morning, and charged them so briskly, that they killed about an Hundred and Se∣venty on the Place, took Thirty seven Pri∣soners, amongst which were two Agas, and several Officers of Note, with three Stan∣dards, Drums, Timbrels, and a considera∣ble Booty. The Imperialists were still within their Winter-quarters, which were so well dispo∣sed, and in that Military Order, as if the Army had been drawn in Battalia,The orderly Disposition of the Chri∣stians in their Win∣ter Quar∣ters. by which means they kept the Seraskier in continual Alarums, on both sides of the Tibiscus. The Hungarian and German Troops posses∣sed a vast Tract of the Country; for Gene∣ral Barkotzi, with Four thousand of his Countrymen, acting joyntly and by agree∣ment with Piccolomini, and the Regiments of Schultz and Dunewald, extended them∣selves all along the Upper Hungary, as far as to the Confines of Poland, to hinder the Incursions of the Tartars, who were used to make that Way their common Road to Pil∣lage and to Infest those Countries. The Quar∣ters of these Forces reached so far as to be near, or (as we may say) in call of Gene∣ral Caraffa, who with the Counts Getz and Terzi, extended their several Bodies of Horse and Foot all along the Confines of Transilvania, and the Counties of Chege and Debrezin, even to the neighbouring Juris∣diction of great Waradin. In like manner General Marcy and Heusler, extended their Quarters from the Province of Zolnok, be∣yond the Tibiscus, into the very Heart of the Turks Country, bringing all those Parts under great and heavy Contributions, and still maintaining a mutual Correspondence with the other Generals: By which means the Turks were so locked up on all sides, that they could not come to the Relief of any one Place without fighting, unless it were Pesth and Buda. The Prince of Tran∣silvania was environed on one side by Ca∣raffa, who laid grievous Impositions on his People; and on the other,Prince A∣pafi in di∣stress. by many Troops that Quarter'd on the Confines, which so hum∣bled him, that he became much more pliable and submissive in his Language towards the Emperor, than he had formerly practised in all the Treaties hold with the Imperial Mi∣nisters. In this straitned Condition, the Prince Apafi acquainted the Ottoman Port, and the Seraskier, that it was impossible for him to answer the Expectation of the Turks either with Men or Mony, unless he were relieved from the Oppression of the Christi∣ans, who levied those Monies on his Sub∣jects, which were designed for his own and the Turkish Forces. To remedy which, the Seraskier drawing forth a Detachment from the Garrisons of Buda and Agria, marched in two Bodies; one by way of Giulia and Lippa, and the other pass'd the Danube at Pesth, by which Mareschal Marcy and Heusler being greatly Alarum'd, drew out their Forces in∣to the open Field, with resolution to give Battle to the Seraskier, who considering that the Success of War was hazardous, and that the ill event thereof might prejudice the Turks in all the Enterprises of the ensu∣ing Campaign; he thought fit to draw off and return back to his former Quarters: Howso∣ever, lest he should seem to act nothing, he detach'd a Body of Fifteen hundred Men to advance forward, and make a dis∣covery of the Forces and Disposition of the Enemies Camp; but being met by a Party belonging to Marcy, were treated so ill by them, that about an Hundred and fifty were killed on the Place, and Fifty taken Priso∣ners, the remainder in a disorderly manner betaking themselves to flight. This Victory opened a free Passage for the Cavalry as far as Wesserhasel, a Country abounding with Provisions for Man, and Forage for the Horse, which the Inhabitants freely bestowed upon them.The Cruel∣ty of Scho∣not. The Garrison of Schonot much offended at this Kindness of Wesserhasel to their Enemies, sent Commis∣saries to examine the Matter, and without much Dispute, empaled diverse People, plun∣der'd and burn'd their Houses and Mills, threatning greater Destruction in case they continued to afford Relief to the Christians. Marcy on the other side being greatly enra∣ged at this manner of Proceedings, resolved to revenge the same on Schonot; and to that end, joyning with Heusler, they at∣tempted
the Town, and were proceeded therein so far, as to enter the Ditch, the News whereof so allarum'd the Turkish Camp, that they resolved with all their force to endeavour the Relief of Schonot;Schonot re∣lieved by the Turks. which Mercy not being of sufficient strength to oppose, drew off from the Town, and pos∣sessed himself of a Pass at the Bridge of Arath, where he hindred the Turkish Forces from joyning; and with a party of Hussars and Dragoons so charged the advanced Troops of the Turks, that they defeated a great number of them, and took the Bey of Lippa, and the Aga of Jiena Prisoners. But all these were petty Actions, and inconsiderable Preludes to what was to fol∣low in the succeeding Campaign, which was now in its beginning.  The general Rendez∣vous of the whole Army was appointed to be on the 15th of May, between Gran and Barkan. The main Body of the Army, which was to act under the Command of the Duke of Loraine,Preparati∣ons for the Campaign. was to be composed of 14.000 German Foot, and 12.000 Ger∣man Horse, drawn out from the Troops of Saxony, Brandenburg and Suabia, to which Three thousand Hungarians were to be joyned, with other Troops, so far as would make up an Army of Fifty five thousand Men; Count Caprara and Count Staremberg were to be Major Generals; the Duke de Croy was created General of the Foot, Prince Lewis of Neubourg, and Count de Susa Lieu∣tenant Generals; the Barons of Tinghen, Thun, and the Marquis of Nigrelli were made Sergeant Majors of Battle. There was likewise another Army preparing under the Command of the Duke of Bavaria,Officers ap∣pointed. consisting of Thirty five thousand Men; of which Eleven thousand were to be Foot, Eight thousand German Horse, to which the Bavarian Troops were to be added, with those of Franconia, and Two thousand Five hundred Hungarians. Of these Count Leslie was nominated for Major General, Count Serini for General of the Infantry; the Marquess of Vergne and Count Schaf∣femberg for Lieutenant Generals; the Barons of Walis and Berk, and the Count de Apre∣mont for Major Generals. Prince Lewis of Baden was made General of the Horse, the Counts Caraffa and Gonda Lieutenant Gene∣rals, and the Counts Piccolomini and Ve∣terani, and Baron Heusler Major Gene∣rals. In this manner all things being prepared and disposed in Martial Order, for carry∣ing on the War for the present Campaign; a Council of War was called to consider and determine the Proceedings and Methods thereof, and to resolve of the Enterprise which was first to be undertaken; upon Debate whereof, two different Opinions arose; one proposed the Siege of Agria, or Alba Regalis, and the other that of Buda. The first urged the difficulty and hazard in the Attempt of Buda, which was much bet∣ter fortyfied than in the former Siege;A Council of War called. for that several new Works were raised on the Banks of the Danube; and that on the other side, the Ditch had been made much more deep and large than it was before: That the Turks had prepared diverse Countermines in those places where the Christians had late∣ly made their Mines: That they had made diverse new Sally-ports: That they had un∣paved all their Streets, uncovered the tops of their Houses to prevent the Mischief which was feared from Bombs and Carcas∣ses, against which they had fortified the large Cistern of Water,Arguments against the Siege of Buda. which was built in the middle of the City: That they had furnished the Town with such quantities of Provisions and Ammunition, and Stores of all things necessary for War and support of Human Life, as were sufficient without other Supplies or Recruits to maintain a Siege for six Months: That the Garrison consisted of Twenty five thousand select Men at least, chosen out of the Janisaries and Spahees, and were all resolute Men and good Soldiers: That the Governour in chief was a stout and valiant Man, a Renegado, and one who was learned and experienced in all the Military Arts of the Christians: That under him six Agas were subordinated, all Men of Conduct and Bravery to succeed in the Government, as one or the other of them should fail. And lastly, That the Town was discharged of all useless and un∣necessary Inhabitants, such as Women and Children, and Jews and Armenian Mer∣chants, who were permitted to withdraw themselves, with all their Goods and Estates, out from the City. Notwithstanding this Discourse maintain'd and urged by divers, the contrary Opinion prevailed for the Siege of Buda; as if the Difficulties thereof served rather to enflame, than to discourage so many valiant and ge∣nerous Spirits:The Siege of Buda re∣solved. Such an Enterprise as the taking a Capital City, with the Conquest of which, the whole Kingdom would fol∣low, and fall a Prey into their Hands, seem∣ed an Adventure and an Exploit worthy the undertaking of so many brave Soldiers, who were certainly the greatest Captains of this Age, and perhaps we may speak it without injury to past times, that they were the best Soldiers that ever the World had produced. Indeed, the whole Army of this Year was in a most Flourishing Condi∣tion, well Provided and Accoutred, Fleshed with Blood and Victory, and so Couragi∣ous that nothing seemed too hard and diffi∣cult for them. And this was one Reason,
to perswade the Military Councils to the Siege of Buda, not knowing whether the next Year would produce such an Army as at present; which as it was capable to undertake any thing, so it was pity to have it wasted and employed in trivial matters, and taking in of Fortresses from whence no Important Consequences could be expected. There was moreover one thing more especially urged, that by the last Siege the Defects and Errors, and false Attacks were all seen and discover'd, the which might now easily be rectified, and provisions made against the mischiefs, which cost the Lives of many Men; and the Ground and nature of it, and Situation being per∣fectly known, the subjection of this place would become much more easie than the time before, notwithstanding all the Provi∣sions the Turks had made. In fine, with these Arguments, as I said, the Siege of Buda was resolved, and every thing prepar∣ed in order thereunto: In the mean time, the Turks were not idle on their part; every Day Olacks or Curriers were dispatched in all hast from Buda to Belgrade, and thence to the Port, to expedite the coming of the Ottoman Army, and Succours for Re-inforce∣ment of their Garrison;Provisions made by the Turks for the War. giving them advi∣ces of the Motion, and Approach of the Imperial Troops against them, which if not prevented would quickly surround their Walls, and intercept their Advices and Re∣lief. The Turkish Officers and Soldiers in all their Quarters in Hungary amassed, and gather'd what Forage and Provisions they were able, which they laid up, and dispo∣sed in those Garrisons which were most ex∣posed to the Enemy; and Re-inforced them with Troops drawn from other places, which were in the least danger of the Enemy, and at farthest distance from them. The Tartars were urged and sollicited, not only to hasten their march to the Confines of Poland, to keep that Country in Awe; but also to send another Body to joyn with the Ottoman Camp in Hungary. In the mean time, Skirmishes daily hapned be∣tween several Hussars and Dragoons belong∣ing to Raab and Strigonium, and detached Parties from Buda; to which place Rein∣forcements were so constantly sent, that the Garrison was calculated to amount unto above Nine thousand Men,  besides the Ci∣tizens and Inhabitants, tho' in reality the numbers were much greater. And in regard, the Grand Seignior was not well satisfied with the Valour and Conduct of the pre∣sent Pasha, another was sent to supply the place,The Pasha of Buda changed. who incessantly laboured both Day and Night about the Fortifications; for tho' it was not certain, whether the Imperialists would make that Siege the business of this Year; yet it was greatly feared, and too much labour and caution could not be used, for the Defence of a place of such Importance. In the mean time the Grand Seignior re∣moved from Adrianople to Constantinople,The Grand Seignior goes to Constan∣tinople. to pass his Summer there, in hopes that his Presence would bring some Trade to that City; but the War had drained all the Money in such manner, that the Merchants found little benefit, or alteration in the quick∣ness of their Trade. The Grand Vizier intended at the same time to have moved from Adrianople towards Belgrade, but the great Fire which had hapned lately there, caused him to retard his March for some Days, in order to rebuild the publick Edifi∣ces consumed by the Fire. Besides the Fire and Sword,Scarcity of Corn a∣mongst the Turks. there was great Scarcity of Corn in all the Ottoman Dominions; by the two first, the Rich were the greatest Suffer∣ers, but the latter was an Aggrievance which most affected the Poor. Howsoever, they supported these Troubles and Losses with Patience, without Murmurings amongst the Citizens, or Mutinies as yet in the Camp. The Moscovites were all this time play∣ing a double Game, having sent an Envoy to the Court to complain of the Incursions, which the Tartars had made into their Country,The Mosco∣vites treat with the Turks. and of the Depredations which the Turkish Governour of Asac, had made upon them at the Mouth of the Tanais. The Envoy found a kind Reception, and Orders were sent both to the Tartars, and Governour of Asac to abstain for the future, from all such Acts of Hostility, and maintain a good Correspondence with the Moscovites, who were become Allies and faithful Friends to the Port: And more to engage the Envoy, some few Russian Slaves were given him, with License to rebuild an old ruined Greek Church in Constantinople; with which to outward appearance, the Envoy returned with entire Satisfaction. The Polish Inter-nuntio, who from the beginning of the War had been kept under restraint at Constantinople, was now upon exchange for a Turk of quality, again set at Liberty; and being upon his return into Poland, was on the Confines met by a Polish Jesuit, who had some Months before been sent by the late Vizier with Letters to that King, containing a Project for making a Peace; and was now returning with An∣swers to those Letters, and Instructions to the Inter-nuntio, in what manner to man∣age a Treaty with the Turks.T Poles make pr∣posals. The Inter-nuntio returned herewith, and made Pro∣posals, That in case the Turks would Sur∣render Caminiec, with all they had taken in Podolia, That then the Polish King would
become a Mediator for Peace with the other Confederates: But the Turks were not as yet sufficiently humbled, to give up any Places they had in Possession, especially that important Fortress of Caminiec, which was the very Key of Poland; and tho' an Expedient was offer'd to Demolish the same, it would not be accepted by the Turks, who had a greater value and esteem for that Place, for having been the only Conquest, which this Grand Seignior had made in Person. And the Turks having no great value of late for the Poles, either as to their Prowess in War, or Conduct in Peace, gave a proud Answer to the Demand; re∣solving this Year to stand on the Defensive part, and to tire out the Christians with a long, and an expensive War: For thô they had lost some of their Towns, and been often beaten in the Field; yet they kept up that Pride and fierceness, which is agree∣able to their nature and former successes in War. The French Ambassador, who had for a long time maintained a Controversy about the Safraw, (as formerly mentioned) did now conceive that it might be a very proper Sea∣son, after such various revolutions and change of Officers, by which the Pride of the Turks might be abased, to obtain those Demands which were formerly denied. The Grand Vizier at the desire of the Ambassa∣dour admitted him to Audience,The French Ambassa∣dors Au∣dience with the Grand Vizier. and treated him very civilly: But howsoever, at the be∣ginning of their Discourse, he gave him a caution not to demand any thing, which was not warranted by the Capitulations: And when the Ambassadour moved, That some Alterations should be made in the Ceremo∣ny of his Audience, that when he arose to put on the Vest, which the Grand Vizier or Chimacam had given; that they also should rise up at the same time, until he was Clo∣thed, and that then they should sit down together. The Vizier provoked a little with this new Demand, believing that it pro∣ceeded from a meaner Opinion conceived of their Power, by Reason of their late Mis∣fortunes, readily Answered with some quick∣ness, and said, That the first Turks, who came over into Europe, passed the Bospho∣rus but with Forty Men only, and that they would return again by the same Way with the like number, rather than condescend to any thing tending to a Diminution, or A∣basement of the Honour of the Empire. In fine, Thô the French were treated at this Audience with more than usual Civility and Respect; yet could obtain nothing more than a Confirmation of the Privileges they had formerly enjoyed, and a Liberty to re∣build a burnt Church. But whilst Preparations were making on both sides for the War of the succeeding Year; It was adjudged in the Councils at Vienna, to be a matter absolutely necessary, to engage the Moscovits in the Confederacy, for that thereby, the King of Poland would not only be freed from all Jealousies, of be∣ing Invaded by the Moscovites, whilst his Arms were otherwise diverted; but the Tar∣tars restrained from their Incursions, in case the Czars would take that Incumbence up∣on them, to give a stop to their Depredati∣ons. The benefit thus doubly considered, Mini∣sters were sent from Vienna and Cracow to Mosco, and many Arguments offered to in∣duce the Czars to enter into the League; the which Work found the greater difficulty and opposition, by reason that a Treaty was so lately concluded with the Turks,  and their Ambassadour returned with a favourable Grant, and Concession of all their Demands: But the Moscovites in reality, could easily dispense with such Articles and Agreements, provided their Interest was advanced, and their Territories enlarged; in pursuance of which, a League Defensive between Poland and Moscovy was concluded for ever, and an Offensive so long as the present War with the Turks should be continued; the which League was Dated the 24th of April, ac∣cording to the following Articles. First, That a perpetual Peace be concluded, and established between the two Powers. Secondly, To avoid all Differences and Disputes, arising about the Titles to be given to the Czars and the King of Poland, the same was agreed by both Parties. Thirdly, That the Poles shall Deliver and Surrender up to the Moscovites, the Palati∣nates of Kiovia and Smolensko, with some other Places specified in that Article. Fourthly, That the Cosacks of those Coun∣tries, shall be mutually discharged of the Oaths of Allegiance, which they had taken to either Crown. Fifthly, That the Rebels and Revolters, who had submitted to the Turks, should find no Protection or Refuge from either Party. Sixthly, That the Czars should pay 1500.000 Florins of Polish Money, to the Government of Poland in two equal Pay∣ments; the first to be made at the Signing and Sealing of the Articles, and the second at the Meeting of the next Diet. Seventhly, That the Towns and Fortresses, Situate on the Banks of the Boristhenes, from Kiovia to the River of Tasmin, which runs by Czekrim, shall not be Rebuilt or Repaired, but that all that Country should re∣main Wast and Depopulated, until such time, as the Differences arising thereupon should be decided by more Ample Authority: The Ple∣nipotentiaries of Poland declaring, That they
had no Power nor Instructions in that parti∣cular. Eightly, That to avoid all Differences, which might arise about the Cities and Places, which were to be Surrender'd by the Moscovites into the Hands and Possession of the Poles, shall be particularly nominated and mentioned: And accordingly they were afterwards nomi∣nated in this Article. Ninethly, That free Liberty be given to the Roman Catholicks, to Exercise their Re∣ligion in the Suburbs of Kiovia and Smolens∣ko: Notwithstanding any endeavours or oppo∣sition, which the Patriarch shall make there∣unto. Tenthly, That their Majesties the Czars, being desirous to introduce and establish the Christian Religion within the Mahometan Do∣minions, at the Instance and Request of the King of Poland, and in pursuance of the League Offensive and Defensive concluded with His Majesty; do Promise and Oblige them∣selves immediately to make War upon the Turks, and with a numerous Army to Invade his Dominions this Summer, by such Ways and Roads, as the Tartars have usually Invaded Poland, and thereby give a stop to their In∣cursions: And that Commands be immediate∣ly dispatched to the Cosacks of the Tanais, That they forthwith Equip their Fleet for the Black Sea, and Trouble and infest those Cities and Countries belonging to the Turks, which are Situate on that Coast. Eleventhly, That in case the Turks shall lay Siege to Kiovia, or any other place ap∣pertaining to the Dominion of the Czars, That then the King of Poland shall send an Army for the Relief and Succour of such place Besieged: And in like manner, in case the Turks shall Besiege Leopolis, or any other City in Poland, the Moscovites shall endea∣vour the Relief and Succour thereof. Twelfthly, That the Czars shall forthwith give Advices to the Ottoman Port of the League concluded with Poland, and their Intentions to make War upon the Grand Seig∣nior: And tho' the Turks upon such intima∣tion shall offer to give satisfaction to either, or both Parties; yet no heed shall be given thereunto, or Conclusion made without the Approbation and Consent of all the Confede∣rate Christians. Thirteenthly, The Moscovites engaged to send their Ambassadours into divers parts of Christendom, as, England, Denmark, Hol∣land, and other Princes to crave their Assist∣ance and Union against the Mahometan Ar∣mies. Fourteenthly, That after a Peace shall be concluded by common Consent of the Confede∣rates with the Turks; And that afterwards one of them shall be desirous to commence a new War, That then the other Confede∣rates shall not be obliged to joyn therein. Fifteenthly, That whereas some Disputes remain still undecided, touching the Limits and Bounds of Poland and Moscovy, That Commissioners shall forthwith be authorized and dispatched for accommodation of that Mat∣ter; especially about the Dependencies on Ki∣ovia. Sixteenthly, That Security of Trade and Commerce be established between the two King∣doms. Seventeenthly, That the Debts which are owing from the Subjects of one Kingdom to those of another, shall mutually be accounted for, and satisfied by one to the other: And that what Suits do or shall arise between the Subjects of either Kingdom, shall be deter∣mined by the ordinary Courts of Justice, where the Defendant abides. Eighteenthly, Those Points which remain undecided, and cannot be agreed by the Com∣missioners, the same shall be remitted to the Determination of the Sovereigns. Nineteenhly, That the People on each side, who live on the Borders, shall pass friendly and peaceably one with the other; and in case of Differences arising between them, the smal∣ler Causes shall be determined by the Pala∣tines, and the greater by Commissioners. Twentiethly, Neither side shall give Suc∣cour or Assistance to the common Enemy, nor entertain any of their Subjects in the War, or in any Office or Employment. One and twentieth, That their Majesties the Czars shall Swear to the Observation of these Articles in presence of the Polish Am∣bassadours. And the like shall be performed by the King of Poland, at a meeting of the Diet, in presence of the Ambassadours from the Czars; and in the mean time, the Ambassadours shall mutually engage, that all these Articles shall be observed and main∣tained. Two and twentieth, That whilst these Articles are interchanging, and before the Ratifications are made, It shall be lawful for the Merchants of each Country and Na∣tion to Trade and Traffick without any trouble or interruption of Commerce: Only Tobacco and Brandy shall not be brought into Moscovy, but remain Contrabanda, as by ancient Ar∣ticles. Three and twentieth, In case the Poles or Moscovites shall have occasion to dispatch Messengers to Persia or other Parts, no mo∣lestation, let, or hindrance shall be given them, nor Passports denied. Four and twentieth, And in regard a good Understanding and Communication is necessary in this War, the King of Poland obliges himself to maintain and defend the Confines and Country of the Dukedom of Solensko, and the Czars so far as Kohzi▪ And that
private Letters shall pay Postage on both sides; but the Publick and Royal Letters shall go free without Charge. Five and twentieth, That both Parties shall give Advices to all the Allies and Con∣federates of this happy League and Agree∣ment. Six and twentieth, That this Contract shall as well oblige the Heirs and Successors as the Princes, who are Parties thereunto. And in case this Original Instrument of Accord should be lost or embezled in the Chancery, or Paper-Office of either side, yet the Agree∣ment shall not be Rescinded thereby, but stand in full Vertue and Force. The League being in this manner agreed, signed, and ratified on both sides, the News thereof soon spread it self over all Europe, and was particularly received at Vienna, and in the Confederate Camp, with as much Joy and Triumph, as it was at Constantinople with Trouble and Confusion. And now it was expected by all the World,How the Treaty was put in exe∣cution. that this Agreement should be executed, and that the Moscovites should in the first place, to give a beginning, have made In∣cursions into the Enemies Country, and without farther delay, have invested those Places, which lay upon the Frontiers; but instead thereof, their first Exploit was to take Possession of the Dukedom of Smo∣lenzko, and of Kiovia, and of about Fifty Leagues of Country, which lies along by the Banks of the Niester; but as to other Acts of Hostility, unless it were by some ranging, and confused Incursions made by their own Cosacks, with design rather to Pilfer and Pillage, than to Offend and Da∣mage the Enemy, nothing of Moment was performed; by which means the Tar∣tars, against whom the Moscovites were o∣bliged to oppose their Arms, found an op∣portunity to joyn with the Cosacks of Po∣land, who with united Forces, not only disputed the Passes with the Polanders, but likewise recruited and reinforced the Grand Vizier's Army in Hungary. After this Agreement was finished, the next Treaty in hand was to deal with Apafi, Prince of Transilvania, to draw him off from his Adherence to the Turk.Treaty with Apafi be∣gun. This Prince finding himself between two great Powers, the least of which was able to crush him to nothing, kept and maintained his Agents at both Courts, only to protract time, and divert a Storm. Count Caraffa quartering with a strong Party of Horse and Foot, on the Confines of that Principality, was appointed by the Emperor to treat with Apafi, and to joyn Menaces and Force to fair Words; but little Satisfaction could be extorted from him, more than a Desire to live in a kind of Neutality; for thô the Im∣perial Forces were not far distant from him, yet the Turks were not as yet beaten out of the Field, nor their Garrisons taken, but all things seemed to remain in a doubtful state and change of War. Thus Apafi fear∣ed both, and demanded Protection and Assistance from both sides, hoping that whilst he was wavering and seemed unfixt, he should preserve both his Friends, or at least not provoke them to be his Enemies. But what Count Caraffa could not obtain by Treaty, he forced by two Regiments, which procured the Contributions, which were then exacted; to which Apafi more easily yielded, because such a Compliance seemed rather an effect of Violence and Necessity, than of Choice. Howsoever,The Turks jealous thereof. the Turks were not so very well assured of the Constancy of the Transilvanias, but that just cause of Jealousie remained of their In∣clinations towards the Emperor; to prevent which, the Turks order'd a strong Body of Men to march and quarter on their Con∣fines, there to attend and observe the Moti∣ons both of the Germans and the Transilvani∣ans; the latter of which seeing the Sword over their Heads, continued still in a state of Irresolution: So that the Emperor e∣steeming, that nothing was to be done by Treaty, commanded the Agents to quit his Court: Howsoever, for a while a stop was given to their Departure; for that the Bro∣ther of the Prince of Valachia,Catachuze∣no sent from his Brother Prince of Valachia to the Em∣peror. called Cata∣chuzeno, (of which Family and Name were the last Greek Emperors) being privately di∣spatched to Vienna, to enter into a Treaty and League with the Emperor, in the Name and Behalf of his Brother, did insinuate many fine and hopeful Projects, for gain∣ing without Blood or Treasure the three Principalities. In order unto which, a Di∣spatch was sent to the Count Scaffemberg, under the Imperial Signature, immediately to march with his Forces to Cassovia, where he should find Orders for his farther Pro∣ceedings; the Count accordingly obeyed; and immediately upon his arrival, received a positive Commission to joyn Seven thou∣sand Germans to Four thousand Hungarians,His Promi∣ses. detached from the Troops quartered in the Upper Hungary; and with that Army, without any farther delay, to march to the Confines of Transilvania, situate on the River Maros, where Catachuzeno had given Assurances, that Twelve thousand Transilva∣nians, well provided and armed, would there be ready to meet Scaffemberg, and joyn with his Forces at their first appearance; and with these, proceeding farther to Vala∣chia, he should there on the Confines have his Numbers increased by an addition of Sixteen thousand Valachians and Moldavians,
with which formidable Force composing a most powerful Army, it was not to be doubted, but that after the Example of their Soldiers, the three Provinces would revolt, and yield to the Emperor; and with such a Force, which nothing could oppose, Incur∣sions might be made with Fire and Sword into all Towns and Quarters of the Turks, from the River Danube to the Confines of Poland, and whereby an intercourse of Arms, and other intelligences would be ob∣tained. This had been a rare design, and a happy project, had all things corresponded with the like Success, and in such a man∣ner as they had been promised, and insinu∣ated by Catecuzeno: But tho' all things did not answer these expectations; yet in other matters, the March of these Forces came very opportunely into those Countries, and served to obstruct the Tartars passage into the upper Hungary, where they were speed∣ing to joyn with Tekeli, and to wast and destroy all those Counties. By this time the Sultan had received a new Confirmation of the Advice, That Apafi had sent Commissioners to Treat with the Emperor at Vienna;Orders sent to the Grand Vi∣zier to relief Prince A∣pafi. and tho' the Turks were well assured of the inclination of A∣pafi towards them, yet not knowing how far the fear and dread of the succesful Arms of the Imperialists might prevail, Orders were dispatched to the Vizier then at Bel∣grade, immediately to send Succours into Transilvania, to six and confirm the waver∣ing Mind of that Prince: Accordingly a very considerable Force being on the march thither, they were encounter'd on the way by Count Schaffemberg, who charged the Ot∣toman Troops sent to secure Transilvania with such Bravery and Success, that he killed and routed that whole Party, and made himself Master of that important Pass of Hermansburg: After which he pressed the Estates of Transilvania once more to declare, but they seeking new pretences and excuses of delay, endeavouring so long as they could to maintain their Neutrality,The Tran∣silvanians joyn with the Imperi∣alists. were so distressed at length by Oppression and Free quarters, and Insolence of the Soldiers, that seeing no other remedy they joyned their Troops with the Imperialists,  and in a Body charged a party of the Tartars and put them to Flight. In the mean time the Season coming on for laying (as was resolved) Siege to Buda, the Duke of Loraine departed from Newstadt, with intention to go to the place of General Rendezvous; but being seized by some In∣disposition, he stopt at Odemberg and came not unto the Muster, and Review of the Army until about 19/29 of May: At which time the Elector of Bavaria, and Prince Lewis of Baden, Count Staremberg, and Count Bielk with a Regiment of Swedish Curassiers, rai∣sed for the Service of the Duke of Bava∣ria, together with the Auxiliary Troops of Saxony came to the Camp at Newstadt upon the River Waagh; but the Brandenburghers, and the Troops of Suabia being not as yet come; the Duke of Loraine marched toward Raab, Comorra and Gran, and put off the Re∣view and Muster of the Army until the 5th of June: But on the first of that Month,A Council held for directing the Siege of Buda. a General Council of War was held to agree upon such Measures, as were to be taken for carrying on the Siege of Buda. At that assembly of Officers, all the miscarriages and defects in the mannagement of the last Siege of the Year 1684 were examined; and Plats brought of the place drawn by divers Hands. In fine, After long Discour∣ses thereupon it was resolved, That every one should possess the same Post, which he held before at the last Siege; and that some false Attacks should be made at first, until the Lines were formed, and secured in such manner as to hinder all Succours from being brought into the City. After the Council was risen, several small Parties of Horse were detached to scowre about the adja∣cent Parts of Buda, Alba Regalis and Erlaw, to make discovery of the State and Condi∣tion of the Enemy. The same Day the Commissary Generals brought unto the Duke of Loraine a List of the Forces, which were formed and in a readiness to be em∣ployed in the Siege of Buda,A List of the Forces designed for Buda. the which was composed of Thirty thousand Foot, and Twenty thousand Horse, besides the Hun∣garians and Brandenburgers, which were not as yet come to the Camp: The Artillery con∣sisted of Sixty Pieces of heavy Cannon, Forty Mortar Pieces, besides a great num∣ber of Bombs, Carcasses and Granadoes, with vast Stores of Ammunition and Provi∣sions. The greatest part of the Army was by this time advanced as far as Gran, which is about Forty English Miles distant from Buda; the Imperial Troops with those of Saxony passed the Danube over a Bridge at Gran, whilst the Bavarians continued their march on the other side; that place being designed for the General Rendezvous, and where the Feast of Corpus Christi falling out on the 13th of June was to be celebrated; the So∣lemnity thereof caused so great a Concourse of People, that the City not being capable to contain them, the Procession was made without the Walls, and within the compass of the Camp. Some Writers say, That the People flocked in greater numbers to per∣form the Festival in that place, where it had been interdicted by the Turks, for the space of One hundred and twenty Years; which now they were joyful to see resto∣red:
These Writers had said more properly, if instead of the word Restor'd, they had used the word Introduced; for that it is scarce an Hundred Years, as yet, since that Feast was first ordained. After this Day of Devotion was past, the Duke of Loraine leaving his In∣fantry under the Cannon of Gran, marched with his Cavalry without any Opposition as far as Marotz, a place near to the Isle of St. Andrew; he caused the Ways to be en∣larged, which were Narrow, and full of Woods and Bushes, and then took a full Survey of all the places Situate near the City. In the mean time the Turks were not idle to secure and defend themselves; and for encouragement of the Garrison of Buda,Recruits brought to Buda. an Aga arrived there from Constantinople, with a great Sum of Money to pay the Soldiers all their Arreares; and being assured now, that the Siege of Buda was certainly design∣ed, great numbers of Boats freighted with Ammunition and Provision, were with a strong Convoy sent up the River; which so drained all the Countries round of Victu∣als, that there was almost a Famine in the adjacent Provinces. Several Troops of the most select and choise Soldiers were likewise sent to Buda, which increased the Garrison to 12.000 effective Foot and Three thousand Horse, besides which the Vizier kept an Army by him of forty five thousand Horse and Foot, which he thought a sufficient Body to oppose any Force, which could be spared and detached from the Christian Army, and to disturb them in their Tren∣ches and Works before Buda. And because the Jealousies which the Turks conceived of the three Provinces of Transilvania, Mol∣davia and Valachia grew higher every Day, and more cause to fear their inclinations to∣wards the Emperor, some Forces were sent against them; but considering that there was great need of an united Force, a great Detachment from the main Body could not well be spared;The Turks demand Hostages of the three Principal∣lities. and therefore it was contri∣ved, that Hostages composed of the No∣blest, and most considerable Persons of those three Principalities, should be sent to the Port, for better securing the Faith and Al∣legiance of those Provinces unto the Sul∣tan: But whilst things remained in this doubtful Condition, the Turks could avail little either by fair Terms, or rude Mena∣ces. But the time now approaching for the Siege of Buda, the Troops of the Heredi∣tary Countries, hastned their march from every Province. The Auxiliaries were already advanced to the Confines, and having quit∣ted their Winter-quartes, marched towards the large Campaign of Barkan, which was appointed for the place of General Rendez∣vous. The Military Stores and Ammuni∣tion, with the Train of Artillery being all in readiness, were dispatched away, part by Water and part by Land,Councils held about the Siege of Buda. besides the Provi∣sions which accompanied the Regiments and Troops in the Field: In the mean time, fre∣quent Councils of War were held at Vienna, at which the Emperor, the Dukes of Loraine, Bavaria and Newburg were present, the Re∣sults of all which tended to the Siege of Buda; towards which place Orders were given to all the Army to march, and to the Officers to repair unto their respective Com∣mands; for thô all the Forces were not as yet come up, yet seeing the Year was so far advanced, it was thought necessary to lose no longer time before the Siege was formed. The Forces immediately under the Command of the Duke of Loraine, to whom the Counts Caprara and Staremberg were Major Generals, consisted of Forty seven thousand and seven hundred Horse and Foot;The Force of the Christians. the Troops under Command of Maximilian Elector of Bavaria consisted of Thirty four thousand Horse and Foot. The Forces under Count Schultz appointed to guard Croatia, and the Banks of the Drave made a Body of Twelve thousand Men; which in all made an Army of Ninety three thousand and seven hundred Men, besides the several Garrisons in Hungary, and the two Bodies of Schaffemberg and Caraffa, which were appointed to act apart on the Fron∣tiers of Transilvania, and along the Tibis∣cus; besides a great number of Voluntiers, which flocked from all places, to gain Ho∣nour and Renown in so Signal a Conquest, amogst which were several Persons of great Quality;  as one of the natural Sons of King James the II. called then Mr. Fitz-James now Duke of Berwick, with many other English Gentlemen of good Quality: Also two Grandees of Spain, namely the Dukes of Vejar and Scalona, with about Three hundred Spanish reformed Officers and Gen∣tlemen of that Nation. With this formidable Force (thô the Troops of Brandenburg were not yet come) about the beginning of June the Army be∣gan to move.June. The Duke of Loraine with his Horse Encamped at St. Andrews,The Ar∣mies march. The Count Staremberg with his Foot at Posscamp, The Elector of Bavaria at Wailun; so that thô the Turks could from the Rampiers of Buda discover the Christians on both sides of the Danube, yet they made no Sallies to hinder, or obstruct them in their march; believing that this might prove a false Ap∣pearance; whilst the real and true intenti∣ons of the Christians was designed against Alba Regalis: But it was not long before they were undeceived, when they saw the Bridge of Communication passed over the River,

and the Bavarian Troops near to Pesth, and their City environed on all sides with armed Force, then they began to believe that the Siege of Buda was designed; for until that time they were of Opinion (as we have said) that Alba Regalis or Great Waradin, or some other place would be the labour of this Summer. On the 19th of June, the whole Army appear'd before the City to the great Con∣sternation of the Turks; and Orders were given to form a regular and close Siege: And to make the Communication between the Ar∣mies the more easie and expedite, a strong and spacious Bridge was built over the Danube, by the Island of St. Andrew,The Turks abandon Pesth. which was Si∣tuate in the middle of the River. The Ba∣varian Troops approaching towards Pesth, enter'd it without any opposition, for that the Turks finding it to be a place not to be de∣fended without a greater Force, than what could well be spared from the Walls of Buda; had Demolished the greatest part of the Works, carried off the Cannon, their Am∣munition and their Stores, leaving the Town dismantled and desolate: Howsoever, be∣fore they had wholly demolished every thing as they had intended, they were sur∣prized by the Bavarian Troops, and forced to quit their Work and fly to the Bridge; but when they came thither, they found it broken down by some of their Companions, who had passed before, fearing to be pursu∣ed by the Enemy; so that terrified and a∣mazed, many leapt into the Water, of which divers were Drown'd, and about Thirty with an Aga were taken Prisoners; the Boats of which this Bridge was Built, float∣ing on one side and the other of the River, were taken up by the Bavarians, and brought to the Isle of St. Andrews, where they ser∣ved, and contributed much to the speedy finishing of that Bridge which was there in Building. Pesth being in this manner possessed; It was agreed at a Council of War, That those Fortifications which were the least damaged should be repair'd;A Fort rai∣sed at Pesth. which was accordingly done, and a Platform made in a Trianglar Figure, and surrounded with a deep Ditch, and fortified with some Cannon, and a sufficient Garrison left to defend it, where∣by they cut off from the Enemy all Incur∣sions and Communications on that side of the River. Apti Pasha was then chief Commander in Buda: He was an aged Man, but a good Soldier and of great experience in the War:Apti Pasha Governour of Buda. He had repaired all the Bastions, and Cur∣tains, and Walls, which had been battered down and blown up in the last Siege; and that those Repairs might be the less seen and discovered by the Enemy, he had cau∣sed all the Walls to be new whited, that it might not appear where the Repairs had been lately made, and the Earth brought, which could not be so close and binding and solid, as the old Works: Moreover he had erected a strong Wall descending from the Castle to the River, to secure the Water and Communication with the Danube. The Duke of Loraine passed over the Water in a little Boat, to Visit and hold a Conference with the Duke of Bavaria then in his Quarters near Pesth; where after some Discourse,Examina∣tion of Turks taken. the Aga taken at the Bridge was examined; and a Turk, who had volun∣tarily escaped out of the Town was brought before them, and declared, That there was not above Eight thousand Men in all the Garrison, accounting Janisaries, Spahees and Segmen (which are a sort of Foot Soldiers, properly belonging to those Countries) and most of them of the new Levies; and that Apti Pasha himself, had not gained so much Reputation and Esteem amongst the Soldiery, as Shaitan Pasha had done, who had so bravely Defended the City in the Year 1684; and thô the wise Generals gave lit∣tle or no credence to such Relations as these, coming from affrighted Prisoners and Captives, whose business it was to flatter, and mollifie the Minds of their Conquer∣ours; yet such Reports proceeding from Witnesses that were come from the City, served to encourage the Soldiery, who were ready to believe what they desire, and what may render their Enemies Low and Contemptible. Count Staremberg received Orders from the Duke of Loraine to perfect the Bridge with all possible speed,Proceed∣ings of the Duke of Bavaria. which being finish∣ed, the Elector of Bavaria, with all his For∣ces, (except those which were left for the Guard of Pesth) passed and encamped his Men at the Foot of the Mount St. Ge∣rard, and took possession of the same Posts and Places which he had possessed two Years before; and on the side of the Mount he raised two Batteries against the upper Town, and made his own Head-quarter, at the Baths of hot Waters, to be nearer to that Place, which his Forces were to Attack; and there raising a Battery of six Pieces of Cannon, he thence drew two parallel Lines of Communication; to which another was added very large and deep extending to the lower Town, into which the same day Two thousand Men were entred to attack that Place.The Quar∣ters of the Army. Next hereunto were the Quarters of Count Staremberg, to which were uni∣ted the Troops of the Prince of Saxony, having their Lines in a circular Form: Next hereunto the main Body of Horse was lodged, being as it were in the middle, and in the most commodious place to op∣pose the Sallies of the Enemies Cavalry;
on the other side of which Prince Lewis of Baden had made his Allodgement. Next hereunto were the Quarters of the Duke of Loraine, opposite to the Breach, which they were labouring to lay open. Next in order were placed the Troops of the Circles, which with the Voluntiers reached to the brink of the River, making a most formidable Body encompassing the Town: And to surround it on all sides, Trenches and Lines were made on the side of Pesth, guarded and de∣fended by Heydukes and Hungarians. Thus was this City again encompassed with the Christian Arms,June. on the 22d of this Month, which about two Years ago, was accounted the impregnable Fortress, and the Sanctuary, and Place of Refuge for the Turks, where For∣tune had made its Ne plus ultra, and set Bounds to the Progress of the Imperial Arms. But these brave Captains and Soldiers being re∣turned again to their old Quarters, remem∣bring the Disgrace they had received by be∣ing foiled, and beholding the Places where their Comrades and Fellow-Soldiers had breathed out their last, and where some of them had received such Wounds, as were still smarting, and scarce healed, became more enraged and animated to avenge themselves, of which they conceived great∣er hopes by Experience and Acquaintance with the Situation of the Place, and there∣by better enabled to amend the Errors of the last Siege, having made Provisions of all things in great abundance, for want of which, Armies commonly suffer more in their Trenches, than they do from the Ef∣forts, and Violences, and Sallies of the Enemy. The provident and wise Duke of Loraine being well advised and aware hereof; and observing that very little Rain had fallen that Spring, so that the Grass and Forage for Horses was very short; and that the great Heats and Drought had burnt up the Pasture in all parts round the Leaguer: He drew out from every Troop ten Men only, to lodge within the Trenches, which made a Body of two Regiments,The Horse Quarters. or Two thousand Horse, under the Command of Count Taff, which were esteem'd sufficient to repulse any Sallies of Horse which the Enemy could make from the Town: But the main and great Body of Horse were ordered to march towards Alba Regalis, under Command of the Counts Palfi and Gondola, and other Generals; and taking their Quarters upon the Banks of the River Saruvitz, they might there not only find plenty of Forage for themselves, but deprive the Enemy thereof, and diminish their Stores; besides, the Place was commodious both to interrupt the Vizier in his March, and all other Succours de∣signed for the Relief of Buda. The parallel Lines of Communication be∣ing finished, by which the Soldiers might pass under shelter to the lower Town, and the Batteries raised on the side of the hot Waters, where (as we said) the Duke of Bavaria had his Head Quarters; Six Pieces of Cannon of Twenty four pound Ball, began first to play on that Wall,Batteries raised. where two Years before a Battery and Breach had been made, and an Assault gi∣ven; the Place was called the Burg of Was∣serstadt, in English, the Water-Town; and here it was thought fit to renew the Batte∣ry; for that the Earth having been lately laid, and the Work repaired, it could not be so well setled, and so firm as the anci∣ent Fortifications, the which was manifest∣ed by a plain and open Proof; for being for one whole Day continually battered, so great a Breach was made, and so wide, as to open a Way to a formidable Assault: On the other side the Turks plyed their Cannon very hard upon the Camp, which did not much damage, thô lodged within Musquet∣shot. And thô the Breach was made, yet it was thought necessary to defer the As∣sault until the Approaches were perfected,June. which before Morning were almost finished, under the darkness of the Night. On the 24th all things being prepared, and a Breach open'd of above twenty Paces wide, a Signal for an Assault was given by firing three Pieces of Cannon;The lower Town as∣saulted upon which the Troops appointed for that Service, ad∣vanced with such Bravery and Resolution, that the Enemy yielded up that Station with little Resistance; and a Party of them des∣cending from the upper Town, gave only a single Volly of Shot, and so again retired with some Disorder.and taken. This being the first Acti∣on of this Siege, there was scarce a Voluntier or Gentleman-Adventurer in the whole Army, but who presented himself in this Enterprize, being desirous to signalize his Valour in the first beginning. The Night following the Turks kept continually firing, which did not hinder the Christians from lodging themselves to the right and left on the Breach of the low∣er Town; in the taking of which, they lost but Eight Soldiers in that Day and Night's Service, which being so cheaply obtained, the Generals suspected that the Enemy had aban∣doned the Place with Design, and with In∣tention to Blow up the Assailants with some Mines prepared for them; and for that rea∣son they gave a stop to the Advancement of the Troops; but the next Day, having searched and examined those Places, and finding all secure, they proceeded to make a new Lodgment in the Angle of the Wall of the lower Town, which answered in a right Line to the main Tower of the upper City, under which they lay secure from the
Enemies Shot. This Exploit being per∣formed with the loss only of Sixteen Men; there was but little Plunder found therein, besides some Horses and Oxen, and some few Field-pieces upon one of the Works; for all the Houses were beaten down by the Turks themselves, and consumed by Fire, and the Inhabitants either fled or re∣tired into the upper Fortifications; which shews evidently that the Turks looking on that Place as not tenable, had drawn their Force into the higher Town, in which they placed all their Security, hoping to make a most vigorous Resistence, both by the advantagious Situation,Lines drawn in the lower Town. and the goodness of the Fortifications: But the Christians finding the Advantage of the lower Ground, whereby to offend the upper City, employ∣ed immediately Two thousand Men, with diverse Laboures to draw the Lines, and deepen the Approaches from one Gate to the other. In the mean time the Turks, who lived in the parts adjacent to Buda, being put in∣to great Consternation by the concourse of the Christian Arms,The Turks near Buda fly to the Isle of St. Marga∣ret. prepared themselves to fly, and seek Refuge in remote parts; so that many, with their Wives, and Chil∣dren, and Servants, having taking with them the best of their Housholdstuff and Goods, passed over to the Island of St. Margarets, which is situate in the Danube, and of a very great length; but finding this Place of too near Neighbourhood to the Christian Army, and very unsecure; having got about thirty large Boats and Barges, they had laden their Goods and embarked their Per∣sons thereon, with design to pass down the River to Belgrade; when a Body of Hun∣garians, Hussars, and Heydukes, under Com∣mand of Count Budiani, having Advice thereof,Are attack∣ed by the Christians and plun∣der'd. armed out a good number of Boats and Barges, and with Three hundred Dra∣goons by Land, boarded their Vessels, and having killed the Boat-men, and the chief amongst them, easily made themselves Ma∣sters of the rest, and of all the rich Houshold∣stuff, Mony, and Goods, in such abundance, that every Common Soldier had a Suit and Vest of Silk for his own Share, with other good Booty and Plunder, which they carri∣ed away, and departed; but being inform∣ed afterwards by some Rascians, that the Inhabitants of that Island had committed many Cruelties and Outrages upon the Christians,Many of them kill'd. they returned again to the Island, which is about seven Hungarian or German Miles long, (which make about Twenty eight English) and there put all to Fire and Sword,  with the Slaughter of about a Thou∣sand Men. After which, Count Budiani went purposely to the Duke of Loraine,June. in the Camp, to render an account of his late Atchievements; and in testimony thereof, he presented him with seven Turkish Stan∣dards, which he had won in that, and in an∣other Rencounter, in which he had defeat∣ed a Party of the Enemy near Ersein, to∣gether with some Prisoners of Quality and Condition, amongst which there was an Aga and Chiaus. The Christian Soldiers animated with these daily Successes, some few of them,26th. with more Temerity than Prudence, made an attempt to Lodge themselves nearer to the Upper City, without those due Precau∣tions of Defence, which are commonly used by throwing up of Earth, and making some little Blinds as is practised in all Military Approaches;The Bold∣ness of the Christian Soldiers. but these bold Men adventu∣red with open Breasts to enlarge their Lodg∣ments on that side of the City which looks towards Strigoniam; which when the Turks observed, a great number of them flanked on one side by the round Tower, and on the other by a Party of Musqueteers, throwing Stones and Hand-granadoes, assailed the Germans, (who were not above Fifty in all) with so much Fury as forced them to make their Retreat; the which notwithstanding they did with good Order, being assisted by their Comrades, who came to their Help, and repulsed the Enemy, and made them with some loss to retire back into the City:Sallies made by the Turks, and are repul∣sed. Howsoever, in a short time after, about the Close of the Evening, the Turks made a more vigorous Sally on the Left-hand of the round Tower of the old City: The Count of Ausberg and the Cavalier Rohne having the Command that Night of those Quarters, with great Bravery received the Enemy, and engaged with them for above an Hour's space; when the Prince of Com∣marcy, and the Prince of Vaudemont having their Quarters near thereunto, came season∣ably into their Succour with many Gentle∣men, who were Voluntiers, and Soldiers of Fortune, and forced the Turks back into the City, with the loss of about Fifty Janisaries: Of the Christians were about ten killed in this Action, which was well paid by the advantage then gained; for whilst the Par∣ties were engaged in this manner, they opened the Trenches on both sides of the old City, with two large Parades or places of Arms, and extended the Lines of the Approaches towards the two Bulwarks of the upper City. And because it was neces∣sary to Batter the City on that side, a Bat∣tery was raised, without the old Wall, of Sixteen Pieces of heavy Cannon, from which many Shot were made at the round Tower, and several Bombs thrown into the City. The Turks nothing disanimated herewith, made a vigorous Sally on the Quarters of the Bavarian Forces, with Three thousand
Horse and Foot; and thô the Elector was at that time indisposed in his Health;The Turks made a Sally and were repul∣sed. yet his Bravery prompted him to mount on Horse∣back, and with the assistance of the Horse, under Command of Lieutenant Colonel Hof∣kerken, which were Quartered in a Vally on the Way towards Strigonium, he with a steddy Foot opposed the Turks, and forced them to Retire with Disorder into the Town. In this Action Twenty four of their Officers were Slain, with many Janisaries, and many Wounded. Of the Bavarians about Forty were Killed, caused by a Surprize at the first beginning of the Sally: The Prince of Savoy according to his natural Courage and Valous, pressing into the thickest of the Enemies numbers, had his Horse Killed un∣der him; but mounting another, pursued the Enemy to the very Gates of the City. Whilst these things were acting, it was a matter of great encouragement to the Camp, to find their Forces daily augmen∣ting by new Recruits.The Swedes and others come to the Camp. For the Swedes were then newly arrived under the Command of the Marquis of Turlac, and took their Sta∣tion on that side, which leads to Alba Re∣galis. These were followed by Lieutenant General Schoning, Commander in Chief of the Brandenburg Forces, whose arrival at the Camp sooner than was expected, was a cause of much Joy and Satisfaction to the whole Army. About the same time also came Prince Lewis of Newburg, Great Ma∣ster of the Knights of the Teutonick Order, with Count Dunewalt, and many Knights of that Order: As also divers famous En∣geniers, together with Count Rabata, who brought with him many Bombs, Mortar-Pieces, with a new Train of Artillery, a∣bundance of Ammunition, and all Warlike preparations: With which, and with the Addition of new Forces, they were enabled to draw a new Line of Communication, without that which was next to the City, extending from one Encampment unto the other; which they supported with small Redoubts raised and fortified with Cannon, which proved to be of great use against the Sallies of the Turks, which were very fre∣quent, and performed with Resolution and Courage: Besides all which Recruits, the Auxiliary Troops of Suabia and Franconia, to the number of Five or Six thousand Men, with two Companies from Passau and Ratis∣bone arrived in the Camp; and on the first of July they took those Stations which were appointed for them.July. The Town was now Batter'd on all sides, and particularly by a Fort raised by the Swedes, which on the third of this Month, began to make a Breach on three Towers which defended the upper Wall.The Works of the City batter'd. The Cannon on the side of the Loraine Quarters, had in four Days time absolutely demolished two Bulwarks, which flanked the Wall on that side, and ruined the Wall it self, having made a very large Breach; to discover which, and to know in what manner it lay open to an Assault, four Musquetiers were Order'd to mount thereupon, and see in what Posture the Turks remained on that side; so soon as these adventurous Men ap∣peared at the Mouth of the Breach, the Turks cried out and took a general Allarum, running immediately to drive them from thence, but they being succoured by another Party of Musquetiers, and by continual Peals of Cannon, and Fourteen Mortar-Pieces, which threw Bombs, the Turks were worsted and lost many Men; and being not able to endure the constant Firings, were forced to Retreat, as also did the four Mus∣quetiers with some Wounds received by Stones and Granadoes. By two or three Inhabitants, who for fear had deserted the Town, informations were given, That by the many Bombs, and the continual Firing of great Cannon, the Consternation was so great,The Turks uncover their Houses. that both the Inhabitants and the Soldiers esteemed themselves in as much danger within the City, as those were who mounted the Guards, and were actually emploied in Defence of the Walls: Where∣fore, to secure themselves the better, the Tops of the Houses were uncovered, and Caves and Vaults made under Ground, to Lodge both the Citizens and the Souldiers;Mines and Counter-Mines. and for the better safeguard of the Garri∣son, which was always exposed on the Walls, it was contrived to make some Mines without at every Bastion, well charg∣ed with Powder, that upon any Attack might be ready to be Fired: Of which the Duke of Loraine having intelligence from these Fugitives, he order'd Countermines to be made, which hinder'd the Turkish Labour∣ers something in their Works; but either by the loosness of the Ground, or the unex∣perience of the Miners, the Success did not answer Expectation: For thô the Miners had proceeded a great way under Ground, by which it was believed, that the Spring∣ing of one Mine would widen the Breach and facilitate the Assault; that Project had little effect,An Assault given, for the Mine being fired did not cast up much Earth: Howsoever, It was followed by an Assault on that side of the Duke of Loraine, of which the Turks being aware made a most vigorous resistance, throwing great quantities of Bombs, Stones and Hand-Granadoes amongst the Besiegers. In this Action above Sixty Musquetiers were killed and wounded; the General Tingen,To the da∣mage of the Chri∣stians. and Major Besancon were wounded with Stones, and the Cavalier de Rosne was shot through the Shoulder. Howsoever, the Im∣perialists
keeping their Ground in their Trenches, about Two hundred Paces from the Wall, did at length repulse the Enemy; and with continual Batteries the Walls were so plied, that from the Tower in the Corner of the City, to the first Bulwark, they were almost ruined and beaten down, as were also the three Towers which were opposite to that Attack. July.The Turks make a Sally on the Brandenburg side.On the 9th of this Month about break of Day, the Turks made another Sally to the Left-hand, where the Brandenburg Troops were lodged, which was performed with such Fury, that the Brandenburgers being surprized, quitted their Posts, and were beaten out of their first Line, with the loss of about Two hundred Men killed, amongst which there was one Captain, one Lieu∣tenant and an Ensign: And the Enemy fi∣ring at the same time a Mine, in which four or five Miners were buried, had caused much more disorder, had not a Body of Reserve, and the Main Guard come in to their Assistance, which so bravely Charged the Enemy, as to force them to Retire in great Confusion. The Imperialists lost in this Action, besides the Brandenburgers above One hundred and fifty Men, amongst whom was a Lieutenant Colonel, who was a Swede, a Cap∣tain of the Regiment of Mansfelt, two Lieu∣tenants and many other subaltern Officers. In the mean time the Bavarians advanced their Approaches, and from a new Battery began to Fire, and shoot at a small Tower, which notwithstanding did little execution, the Walls being very good on that side. The same Day a Deserter from the Town brought News, That the Besieged expected in Twenty four Hours time a Reinforce∣ment of Three thousand Men;Succour sent to Pest. upon which intelligence Three hundred and fifty Men were immediately dispatched over the Wa∣ter unto Pesth, to strengthen the Redoubt at that place, and to prevent the Turks in their design of cutting off all Communication between that Fort and the Camp. And up∣on farther intelligence, that the Turks assem∣bled in great Bodies about Segedin, the Duke of Loraine dispatched away the Baron Marcy, with Three thousand Horse, and six Battalions of Foot over the Danube, with Orders to advance as far as Hatwan, and to Engage the Turks in what place soever it should be his Fortune to meet them: Accor∣dingly Baron Marcy passed the River,Marcy sent to oppose the march of the Turks. and posted himself near the Bridge of Pesth, there to attend the Enemy who were coming up∣on him, as was reported, with a Body of Ten thousand Men, under Command of Achmet Pasha: Upon which Advice, the Duke of Loraine dispeeded away three Im∣perial Regiments, to joyn with and rein∣force the Detachment under Marcy, lest the Enemy should seize the Passage over the Teysse. In the mean time, the Christians working hard upon a Mine on the Bavarian side, which they designed should make the Breach wider and larger than it was, were discovered by the Turkish Miners, who were preparing a Mine near thereunto; and had almost completed it, when fearing lest the Christians should be before-hand with them, they precipitated matters sofast, that due care was not taken to hinder a Reverse; but on the contrary,The Turks Fire a Mine to their hurt. the Turks gi∣ving Fire to their Mine, it recoyled back on themselves, and buried many of their Men, and so shook the Walls and Fortifi∣cations of the Tower, that by the help of a Battery of eight Pieces of Cannon, which were levelled and plaid upon it, the Breach was made considerably wide, and so en∣larged, that at a Council of War held on the 13th of this Month, it was resolved not longer to defer the Assault on the Bavarian side:July. The Orders for which were no sooner Issued, and the Signal given, than all the Voluntiers and brave Adventurers in the Army, Transported with Ambition,An Assault made on the Town. and De∣sire of Glory, pressed to be the first that should mount the Breach. In this Action Count Guy of Staremberg, Count Herber∣stein, and Count Aversberg were Commanded each with Two hundred and twenty Men to make the Assault in three several places; the first of which was to enter in the middle of the Curtain, the second on the right Hand, and the third on the left; amongst which some Granadiers were mixed, and Pioniers to prepare and level the Ground to make an Allodgment; and a Reserve of Two thou∣sand Men was appointed to sustain, and second the Assailants. The Ascent unto the Breach was very difficult, and the Turks had repaired it in many places with Paliso∣does; howsoever to brave Minds spirited with a desire of Glory, such as were the Voluntiers, who were Gentlemen of princi∣pal Quality, from divers Parts and Nations of Europe, nothing seemed so difficult and ha∣zardous, but what they were able and daring to surmount. The Onset was made about se∣ven a Clock in the Evening, and the first thing attempted was to force up the Palisadoes, which being done, they found the Besieged posted behind in their Trenches with good Order; the Christians Attacked them with great Vigour, and the Turks made an equal Defence, pouring whole Vollies of shot with great numbers of Granadoes, and discharg∣ing a prodigious quantity of Stones from their Mortar-pieces upon them; on each side likewise was a round Tower filled with Musquetiers and Granadiers, who bestowed their Shot liberally upon them; so that the Assailants being between Firings on each
side, as also on the Front were killed and wounded in great numbers;An Assault given with loss to the Christians. howsoever they made themselves Masters of the Breach, which they maintained and defended above the space of an hour; but at length the heat of the Fight was so great, as had put things in∣to much Disorder, and caused the Pioneers and Labourers to disperse; and a Provision of Faggots, and Sacks of Earth not being at Hand sufficient to cover the Assailants, they lay naked and exposed to the Shot of the Enemy; and at the same time a Mine be∣ing prepared, and fired under the Breach, it did great execution; so that many Persons of great Quality and Valour were killed and wounded in this Action; and the Turks making a Sally in another place at the same time, the General caused a Signal to be gi∣ven for the Troops to Retreat, which was done in very good Order. The Regiments of Souches, Mansfelt and Staremberg, were those which suffer'd most in this Action. The Persons Wounded were: The Prince of Commarcy. The Duke of Bejar, a Grandee of Spain. Marquis Blancfort, Son of Mareschal Cre∣qui. Count Staremberg. Count Dona. The Duke of Escalona, a Grandee of Spain. Two Captains of Souches's Regiment. The Baron Chifler, the Natural Son of Prince Rupert. My Lord George Savil, Second Son of the Lord Marquis of Halifax. Count Maldeghen. Mr. Fitz James, Natural Son of King James the II. of England. Count Urse, three Spanish Gentlemen. Monsieur Sulpice, a Gentleman belonging to the Prince of Commarcy. Persons Killed were: Prince Palatine of Veldens. Prince Piccolomini. Count Hortemback, Page to the Duke of Loraine. The Cavalier of Courmaillon. Count Ermestein, Major of Schezfemberg's Regiment. Six English Noblemen, amongst which was that Worthy Gentleman Colonel Robert Forbus, Second Son to the Earl of Gra∣nard. Three Spanish Gentlemen, belonging to the Duke of Bejar. The Turks had about Two hundred Men killed, and One hundred wounded. The Besieged thinking hereby to have gained a great advantage over the Christi∣ans, and thereby to have put them into some Confusion and Disorder, made a Sally that Night on the Brandenburgher's Quar∣ters; but were vigorously repulsed back again into the Town, with the loss of many Heads, which the Brandenburghers carried into the Camp, to receive the usual Rewards promised thereupon. For several Days there hapned nothing but Batteries, and Firing Mines on one side and the other; but the Mines on the Chri∣stian side did not so much execution, as did those of the Turks: Howsoever, the Bombs were much available, and did great damage within the Town;Terrible ef∣fects of Bombs to the Turks. especially those of a new Invention made by an In∣genier called Gonzales, which not only kil∣led, but set all on Fire wheresoever it fell. One of this sort of Bombs hapning within the Walls of a great Edifice, (for as we said before, all the Roofs and Coverings were taken off) produced most terrible and direful effects, not only beating down the Walls, but Killed above One hundred Men, Women and Children. The Turks to Re∣venge themselves for all these Slaughters, were very diligent and active in Springing their Mines,Of Mines to the Chri∣ans. which they had prepared with great Art; by which many Soldiers and Officers of note were destroyed, to the great diminution in number of the Besieg∣ers: In the mean time the Christians plied their great Guns, and Sprang the Mines to widen the Breaches, in order to make a General Assault, for which Preparations were daily made, and Ladders brought, and all Instruments provided in order there∣unto. On the 20th Day of July,July. about seven a Clock in the Morning, a strange hollow Noise was heard under Ground,The great Magazine of the Turks Blown up. and the Earth trembled both in the Town, and un∣der the Feet of the Soldiers in the Camp; and a dark Cloud of Smoak and Ashes co∣ver'd the City, so thick and black, that for the space of an hour, scarce any thing of the Walls themselves could be seen; which caused a Terrour in the Minds of the Besiegers, notwithstanding their Resolution and Bravery; for whole showers of Stones were cast up, and thrown into the Bavari∣an Trenches, whereby many Soldiers and Officers of Quality were Wounded: And whilst the Elector of Bavaria, and the Prince of Baden were busily employ'd in Riding about to confirm their Soldiery, a Stone of considerable weight and bigness fell between them: All which Convulsion hapned by blowing up of the chief Magazine of the City, whether by Bomb from the Camp, or any other Accident is uncertain:
But such were the dreadful effects thereof, That it shook down one Wing of the Ca∣stle, and that side of the Wall towards the Water; threw vast quantities of Stone and Rubbish into the Danube; and Killed above Fifteen hundred People, who were useless and unfit for Service, and had for their better safety hid themselves in Vaults and Cellars: By this unexpected Blow, the City being much weakned towards the Water, Giavarino Lieutenant General of the Hey∣dukes, was Order'd with a Party of his Sol∣diers to take the advantage of this Accident, and to post himself in the best manner he could, to hinder all Sallies of the Enemie by that way, and to make that side more easie and fit for Storm. But whilst the Duke of Loraine thought of these things, and how much his Forces were diminished by Assaults, by Sallies of the E∣nemy, by Mines, by Sickness and various other Accidents; and how much Blood it might still cost, before the Town could be forced to Surrender by dint of Sword, he resolved to make use of this opportune Mis∣fortune, whilst the Turks remain'd in their Terrour and Amazement to try the Pasha with Capitulations and good Conditions in case of Surrender, and to send him a Summons in Writing, by the Hand of Count Coniseck, who according to his Instructions, represented the State and Con∣dition of the Affair to the Pasha Gover∣nour, that the Christians were very strong without,Summons sent to the Pasha. and resolved to take the Town, the Walls of which were almost demolish'd, and their Garrison laid open and exposed; and that a General Assault was determined; and that since they could not reasonably expect any Relief or Succour, the Pasha would do better Service to his Master the Ottoman Emperor by saving the Blood of his People, than by a desperate defence to sa∣crifice the Lives of so many by his wilful obstinacy; nor hereby could he give occa∣sion to any to tax him, either for want of Valour or Conduct, since he had given such fair Evidence of both unto the World. The Pasha received the Messenger with much more Humanity, than they did ever practise in the times of their Prosperity, and heard him with great attention; and Read the Letter sent him by the Duke of Loraine several times over: But before he would make any Reply thereunto, he called a Divan or Coun∣cil, in which the Business being debated for the space of about three hours; at length this Answer was returned in Writing, and put up in a Purse of White Sattin, accord∣ing to the Custom of the Turks; which was to this effect. That he did wonder much from which of his Actions during this Siege, he could ground any Hope upon these Summons, that he should, or could be prevailed with to make a Surrender, not having been guilty as he imagined of such mean and Cowardly beha∣vior, as might merit so great an Affront to his Valour, as to be tempted with Conditions and Terms how Honourable soever unto a Surrender. But in case He,The Pasha's Answer. and his Soldiers had appear'd in the least manner Timorous and Base, That they would amend that fault by a more vigorous De∣fence, and by such Actions as should make it appear to the World, that, that City was con∣served with a Bravery equal to the Impor∣tance thereof; That God would punish the Pride of the Christians, for daring so much as to conceive a thought of bringing low the Otto∣man Emperor, from whom having received the Command of that Place, he was resolved to deliver it unto no other, than unto him only. Whilst this Treaty continued, which was for the space of three Hours, a Cessation of Arms was granted, during which time, the Soldiers on each side discoursed friend∣ly, and jested together, and reached to one another their Pipes, and their Tobacco; from whence it may be seen, how natural Love and Friendship is to Mankind, and how unnatural and violent is Hatred, War and Cruelty. From this Haughty and Resolute Answer of the Turks many did conjecture, That they had received promises of a speedy Re∣lief; which caused some Reports and Dis∣courses in the Camp, That the Vizier was marching with a very numerous and puissant Army for their Succour: Of which thô the Besieged had no intelligence; yet consider∣ing that the thing was not improbable, the Turks conceived some hopes from thence, and the Christians prepared to receive and engage them. Nor was the expectation of Relief by the March of the Turks without some ground; for at Hatwan in the Upper Hungary great numbers of them joyned in one Body,A stop gi∣ven to the progress of the Turks. which with much advantage might descend with the Current down the River, and give trouble and disturbance at the Siege of Buda: To prevent which, some Bridges were sent, for passing the Regiments of Horse under Caprara, and the Prince Charles of Neuburg over the Rivers, unto such Commodious Passes, as were advanta∣gious to restrain those Forces from farther proceedings. In the mean time some com∣fortable News was brought to the Duke of Loraine from Count Caraffa, who advised, that upon intelligence of a very considera∣ble Convoy sent from Segedin, for the Re∣lief and Reinforcement of Agria; he with General Heusler resolved to make an As∣sault thereupon; which design failing, gave an occasion howsoever to give a Defeat to a great part of the Garrison of Agria; in
which Action Caprara posted himself in a close, and deep Vally, cover'd on both sides with Hills; and about half a League be∣yond Peterhasi with some Hungarian Troops well Armed, was order'd to lie in Ambush; from whence he detached about Fifty Hus∣sars to March towards the City, and in their Way to take up all the Horses and Cattle they could find in the Pastures, with Orders that in case the Garrison should Sally out upon them, that they should feign a seem∣ing Flight, and draw them on until they came near the Camp: The which being ac∣cordingly performed by the Hussars, Osman Pasha of Agria pursued them close with a select number of his best Soldiers, until un∣warily he fell into the Ambuscade which was laid for him;The Pasha of Agria defeated. from whence the Hungarians Sallying forth renewed the Fight, being se∣conded by General Heusler's Dragoons, who kept the Enemy in play until the Foot were come up to their Assistance: And then Os∣man Pasha being sensible of the Snare into which he was fallen, encouraged his Men bravely to defend themselves, and to make an orderly Retreat, but he was then too far engaged; for after a hot and desperate Conflict, above Two hundred and fifty of the Garrison were killed, and about One hundred Prisoners taken, and amongst the rest Osman Pasha himself was slain: How∣soever this Victory was not gained without some loss on the Christians side; for Baron Bur a Captain of Dragoons, and the Cap∣tain Lieutenant of the Regiment of Castelli, with above Twenty Common Soldiers were, killed, besides many wounded; this En∣gagement being towards the Evening, the remainder of the Garrison by covert of the Night, made their Retreat back and re∣cover'd the City. Whilst these things were acting, the Siege of Buda proceeded with various Fortunes; and the wise Generals were not only intent thereunto, pressing forward with the greatest Bravery imaginable; but also were wary, and vigilant to observe the Motions of the Turkish Army designed to raise the Siege: For by certain intelligence it was advised, That the Seraskier was on his March, but that he moved slowly, to give time unto the other Troops, which were Quarter'd along the Banks of the Rivers Save and Drave to come and joyn,Advices that the Seraskier approached for that the Forces of the Turks were not so numerous, as to ad∣mit of any Detachments, but rather to Fight in one Body only: It being necessary to secure the Passage by the Bridge of Esseck, Eight thousand Men were order'd to pos∣sess it; but News coming, that the Imperi∣alists were already Masters of it with a far greater Force, the Seraskier passed the Ri∣ver by a Bridge at Peter Waradin, and stayed at Segedin; from whence he order'd a Flying Army of Horse composed of Turks and Tartars, to March unto Alba Regalis, from whence they were order'd by frequent Sallies and Alarums to offend and amuse the Christian Camp before Buda; until such time as the Grand Vizier being enforced by the Asian Horse, and by the Tartars, might be able to joyn with them at Alba Regalis; from whence it was designed to make all their Sallies upon the Camp.Schultz watches his Motion. Of which General Schultz having advice, whose business it was to observe the Motions of the Enemy, he pitched his Camp along the Drave, from whence he observed the March of the Ene∣my, and narrowly watched the Garrisons of Kanisia and Zigeth. The Leaguer being thus secured from outward Assaults, every Quarter of the City was attacked by sever∣al turns, sometime by the Bavarians on their side, by the Brandenburgers on theirs, and by the Imperialists, and others in their several Stations, with Mines and Counter∣mines, with Cannon and Batteries, Bombs and Granadoes, and all other Instruments of Death, which cost much Blood on one side and the other. At length, to bring Mat∣ters to a more sure and speedy Issue it was resolved, to prepare all things against the 27th of July for a General Assault, which was to be performed by Fifteen thousand Men; That is, Five thousand at the At∣tack of Loraine, Five thousand of Bavaria, and as many of Brandenburg, besides Two thousand Talpatsi, which are a People of Hungary;A General Assault pre¦pared. and that the Besieged might be attacked on all sides, and their Forces di∣vided thereby, the Lieutenant General Gi∣avarino Commander of the Haidukes, was order'd to make a seeming Attack by the Water-gate, where part of the Wall near the Castle was thrown down by the Maga∣zine which was lately fired: For this Ge∣neral Storm all things were well prepared; the Officers of most experience, and bravery were appointed to lead the Assailants unto the respective Attacks, and Labourers pla∣ced in a readiness to carry Faggots, and Sacks of Earth to cover the Men, and make good the Lodgments, and others with Mattocks and Spades, and such like Instruments to dig and throw up the Earth. The Duke of Loraine intending to be∣gin the Assault at break of Day in the Morn∣ing, passed that Night in the Trenches; but when they were ready for that Enterprise on the Bavarian side, all the Palisadoes were on Fire, and burnt with so violent a Flame, caused by a certain mixture of bituminous stuff, that the Attack was deferr'd until to∣wards the Evening; before which time some Rains falling, served to extinguish the fierce∣ness of the Fire, and the Duke of Loraine and
Bavaria after some Consultations together resolved forthwith to proceed unto the As∣sault;The Assault made. the Sign for which was given by fi∣ring three Pieces of Cannon: Upon which Signal the Imperialists, Bavarians and Bran∣denburgers drew out of their Lines, and ad∣vanced against the Breaches: The Imperia∣lists soon made themselves Masters of the great Tower, but were quickly droven thence by the Turks; which when the Duke of Loraine observed from the place where he had posted himself, for to give out his Orders; he immediately in Person advanced with fresh Troops to sustain and support the first; the Presence of the General, who was engaged in a dangerous place,The Exam∣ple of the General encourges the Soldi∣ers. with the Sword in his Hand and Casket on his Head, did so animate the Soldiers, that inflamed with a de∣sire to imitate the bravery of their General and preserve his Person, they all returned to the Fight; and tearing out the Palisa∣does all on Fire, in despight of the Ene∣mies shot and resistance, they bravely lodged themselves upon the Breach of the first Wall, and presently made themselves Ma∣sters of the great Tower, with two other small Bastions on the Right and on the Left-hand; driving the Turks into the Re∣trenchments, which were lately cut behind the new Palisadoes: But the Christians so plied them with small Shot and Granadoes, that they were forced to quit that place al∣so, with great loss and slaughter of their Men: But while they were labouring to secure that Ground and the Lodgment there; the Enemy gave Fire to four Mines, which tossed up many of those into the Air who were the farthest advanced:The Turks Fire four Mines. Howsoever, the Presence of the Duke of Loraine so en∣couraged the Soldiers, that in emulation of each other, they pressed forward, and made themselves Masters of that Ground, which their other Fellows had newly quitted with the loss of their Lives. At the same time, the Brandenburgers were so successeful in their Enterprise, that they took the Tower which they attacked, whereon were Seven∣teen Pieces of Cannon with some Mortars. The Elector of Bavaria also succeeded in his Enterprise, leading on his Men in Person, and possessed himself of the great Tower which fronts the Castle, whereon were seven Pieces of Cannon, and two Standards of the Janisaries. On that part of the City allotted to the false Attack of the Heydukes, no great mat∣ter was performed, nor nothing expected; for the place was strong, and the Party ap∣pointed for the Assault was to make a di∣version of the Forces, rather than in good earnest to gain a Lodgment. During these Attacks the Turks made a Sally, and charged the Christians in the Flank, but being watched by some Squa∣drons of Horse, were repulsed back into the Town with great loss; and finding that the Christians were pressing forward, as far, as to to the second Wall, they set Fire to a sort of sulfureous and bituminous matter,Sulfureous Fires much annoy the Christians. composed on purpose to suffocate and poi∣son the Lungs, which being thrown into the Ditch, gave a stop to the Progress of the Assailants: But a Wind arising soon after∣watds, which carried the Fire and Smoke towards the Town, annoied the Defendants in such manner, that they were forced to quit their Station, and suffer the Christians without farther resistance to keep, and make good the Ground they had taken. This Assault continued for the space of four hours, with a vast effusion of Blood on one side and the other; but the Imperi∣lists, Bavarians, Brandenburgers and all o∣ther the Assailants, with unparallel'd Va∣lour fighting amidst the Fire and Smoke,A cruel Assault; Granadoes, Stones, Swords and Lances without any regard to their Lives, and ani∣mated by the Bravery of the Commanders, who were as forward to expose themselves to danger, as the meanest of the Common Sol∣diers, possessed at length, and lodged them∣selves on all round Bullwarks, and Walls made with Earth, reaching from one side of the City unto the other. About Sun-setting the Attack ceased, and both sides as it were by mutual consent gave over the Fight, which ended with the great advantage of the Christians, who had penetrated to the second Retrenchment of the Wall and Ditch:Which ends at Night. And Night coming on, those who were ty∣red with that Day's Labour, were relieved by others, who were all Night long em∣ployed in raising Earth, and fortifying the places which they had gained, on which they mounted Cannon, and turned those on the Enemy which they had taken from them; and the next Day began therewith to Batter the inward Wall. It is impossible to express the Bravery and Resolution, with which this Attack was maintained: For besides the Gallantry of all the Officers in general, the Duke of Loraine, and Count Staremberg gave undeniable Proofs of their Courage, of their indefatigable Industry, and of their Zeal for the Glory of the Em∣perour, and the Christian Religion; not on∣ly attending unto their own Quarters, but hazarded their Persons in all places, where their Presence and Directions were necessa∣ry or useful. In this Enterprise many brave Soldiers and Officers were slain, who were ready to Sacrifice their Lives, being pushed forward with an Ambition to signalize them∣selves in the Presence of their Generals; the numbers of them were so great, that to make the Victory look more cheerful, it
was thought fit to conceal them; only such as were of principal note, were acknow∣ledged as followeth. Killed. Monsieur Artein Agitant General to the Duke of Loraine. Serjeant Major Pini. Count Schlik. Baron Geta, with many other Subaltern Officers of great experience. Wounded. The Duke of Croy. The Prince of Commercy. Serjeant General Diepenthall. Baron de Asti. The Serjeant Major of Staremberg, with two Captains. Serjeant General Dingen. The Lieutenant Colonel of Neuburg's Regi∣ment. Killed of the Brandenburgers. The Count of Dona. Serjeant Major Maruvitz. Wounded. The Duke of Curland, with many other in∣feriour Officers. The Elector of Bavaria and Prince Lewis of Baden, with incomparable Conduct and Bravery, exposed their Persons to danger and hazard in all places which required their Presence,The Elector of Bavaria secures the Works which he had taken. and remained all Night upon the Watch, giving directions in what man∣ner the Labourers were to work, nor did they Retire, or take any Rest or Repose, until the Lodgments were secured: For during the Darkness of the Night, they had formed a strong Trench round the Tower, which is under the Wall of the Ca∣stle; and made smooth the heaps and ruins of Stones and Rubbish, by laying thereon an innumerable number of Sacks of Earth, whereon the Troops could with a large Front march up to relief of the Guards. And now whereas the innermost Gate of the Castle was possessed by the Bavarians, so that it could not longer hold out; the Turks thought fit for saving their Men to abandon it wholly, the Garrison being much diminished, and their numbers abated in the late Attack. Officers and Soldiers killed and wounded.In which of the Regiment of Bavaria were killed, A Captain, and wounded a Ser∣jeant Major, a Captain and three Lieute∣nants. Of the Regiment of Baden were killed two Lieutenants, and wounded five Captains, one Lieutenant and three Ensigns. In the Regiment of Aspremont, Killed one Ensign, and wounded the Colonel, the Lieutenant Colonel, Count Nicholas Palfi, Serjeant Major, Count Zacco, a Cava∣lier of Malta, and six other Captains, five Lieutenants and two Ensigns. In the Regiment of Rummel killed, A Cap∣tain and a Lieutenant; wounded a Cap∣tain and an Ensign. In the Regiment of Gallenfels, killed the Lieutenant Colonel; wounded two Cap∣tains and a Lieutenant. In the Regiment of Furstemberg, wounded a Captain, a Lieutenant, and an En∣sign. In the Regiment of Beck, wounded the Lieu∣tenant Colonel, the Baron of Welsberg, five Captains, five Lieutenants, and five Ensigns. In the Regiment of Steinau, killed a Ser∣jeant Major and a Lieutenant; and wound∣ed a Captain, two Lieutenants and an Ensign. In the Regiment of Seibolstorff, killed a Ser∣jeant Major; and wounded a Captain and two Lieutenants. In this Attack, of the Imperialists and Ba∣varians, were killed Common Soldiers an Hundred and seventeen; wounded Nine hundred seventy two. Of the Saxons, were killed a Lieutenant Colonel, two Corporals, and seventy Com∣mon Soldiers; wounded a Lieutenant Co∣lonel, two Serjeant Majors, two Captains, a Captain Lieutenant, three Ensigns, two Serjeants, two Corporals, and a Hun∣dred Ninety nine Common Soldiers. Having in this manner, with a vast effu∣sion of Bloud, entred as far as to the in∣ward Wall, all Art and Industry was used to blow that up with new Mines, at which they laboured with so much diligence, that in a Day and a Night's time they were finished and fired;Another Assault. the third of which did such great Execution by opening the Breach, as invi∣ted the Besiegers to make an Assault; to the performance of which, Twelve hundred foot Soldiers, and Four hundred Dragoons were appointed; but their Officers being for the most part killed or wounded, the Duke of Loraine was forced to make use of the two Generals of Horse, the Counts of Lodron and Styrum, to Command the At∣tack; and in the mean time that they were coming, a Battery of three Pieces of Cannon was raised on the Curtain lately possessed, with four Mortar-pieces, both to widen the Breach, and offend the more in∣ward parts of the Town. But whilst this was doing, the Besieged were making a new Retrenchment behind the Breach, which was an evident Proof, that they resolved to
defend the Place unto the last extremity. But not to drive Matters to that ultimate Period, the Turks sent on their part two Agas to the Duke of Loraine to enter on a Treaty; and the Duke on his side sent his Adjutant General, the Count of Lamberg, with his In∣terpreter,July 31st. A Treaty begun. into the Town; where he was in∣troduc'd to the Presence of the Pasha, with such Respect, Ceremony and Honour, as was agreeable to the ill Circumstances under which the Turks labour'd; but he return'd again with no other satisfactory Answer than this: That the Officers and Commanders of that Government could not, nor would not so easily yield and sur∣render up that City, which is the Key of the Ot∣toman Empire: But when it should be thought sit to conclude, and establish an universal Peace, that they would then oblige themselves, that an Equivalent should be given to the Emperor, by the Delivery of two other Places: And that they were ready to give up the same, and conclude a Peace, for making which, they had received a sufficient Power from the Grand Seignior, pro∣vided that the Siege be immediately raised. With this Answer the Generals not being pleas'd, they began on both sides to fire with the usual Fury,Batteries raised and Mines fired. and that Night they finished two Bat∣teries, which were raised for enlargement of the Breaches, and three Mines were fired, which fill'd a great part of the Ditch with Earth; but one of them recoyling back, bu∣ry'd a hundred Men of the Brandenburger Troops, who were advanc'd too far, and were not advertis'd, when the Mine was to be fir'd. The next Day following, about Nine a Clock in the Morning, the Turks beat again a Parly towards the side of the Breach of the Bavarian Quarter, and sent the two Agas, which had been employed the Day before with the Duke of Loraine,Another Parly unto the Elector, desiring that two Hostages might be returned in their Places, which being done accordingly, one of the Agas offered in the Name of the Vizier of Buda, To yield and surrender up the Place, with all the Dependencies, which he avowed to be very great, and to contain no less than a Hundred and Fifty Leagues of Land thereupon depend∣ing, or otherwise to deliver up any other two places within the Kingdom of Hungary, being under the Turks Dominion, at the Will and Choice of the Emperor, provided that a gene∣ral Peace might thereupon be concluded and ensue:which is broken off. But in regard the Elector was suffi∣ciently informed, that it was not in his own nor yet in the Emperor's Power to make a Peace without the common Consent of the Allies, for which there was no time at that critical Season: The two Agas were re∣manded back, and the Hostages returned, and then the old Trade proceeded, and they began again to fire on all sides as before. But this Cessation of Arms was made use of by the Christians, for discovery of the Breach of the Castle, and the entrance thereunto by way of the Town; of which a Lieutenant Colonel belonging to the Regiment of Baden, took a particular Observation. The same Day a Mine was fired by the Imperialists at the Attack of Loraine, which made a Breach in the second Wall, and sha∣ked the third, which so alarum'd the De∣fendants, that in great numbers they came running to that place;The Bava∣rians enter the Castle, but are re∣pulsed. by which such a diver∣sion was made of their Forces, as gave the Bavarians an opportunity to enter the Ca∣stle; but being not able to make good their Ground, they were constrained to abandon the Lodgment which they had already begun.August. During these Actions, Count Staremberg applying himself to all places,Count Sta∣remberg wounded. where his Presence was required, without any regard to the hazard and danger of life, he received a Musquet Shot on his Left-hand, which carried away his Thumb; and with another Shot he was both wounded in the Cheek, and in the Shoulder; but the Wounds were so slight,Duke of Loraine sick. as did not constrain him to with∣draw from his Care and Command. The Duke of Loraine was at the same time indi∣sposed in his Health by the accession of a Fever; which though not very violent, yet it gave some cause of Fear and Discourage∣ment to the whole Camp; howsoever the Spirit of this Hero was so great, that he still continued to prosecute his Enterprize, and give direction for perfecting the Mines, which were now necessary on that side; for that little thereof could be effected at the Bavarian Attack, where the Labourers were stopped by Rocks and Quarries of Stone:The Diffi∣culty of the Mines. And whilst the Miners worked at the Breach of Loraine, they were forced to withdraw themselves from the pestilential Air, caused under Ground by the noisome Stench of dead Bodies. Howsoever, the Mine under the third Wall was finished, and sprung with good success, thô the Ditch was not so fil∣led, that the Soldiers could pass to the Assault; yet bringing Sacks of Earth, and other defensible Matter, they lodged and co∣vered themselves at the foot of the Breach. Whilst the Siege proceeded with all this heat and vigour, certain News was brought, that the Grand Vizier had com∣posed a Body of Seven thousand Horse,News of the Grand Vi∣zier's March. drawn out of divers Garrisons in Hungary, and caused them to advance as far as Sa∣rowitz, which is within Thirteen Leagues of Buda, and that other Troops had passed the Bridge of Esseck, and that the Seraskier was appointed to guard that way, until the Vizier in Person had made his Passage, who with 40.000 Men was marching to the Relief of distressed Buda; and that he would be shortly Reinforced with a very
great Body of Tartars and Asiatick Horse, which were already on their March, and had passed Adrianople. But the Generals, who had received more certain Advices of the Strength of the Vizier, were well assu∣red, that neither the Number of his Soldiers was so great, nor the Quality of them so formidable, being for the most part compo∣sed of soft Asiaticks, of Country-men and People inexpert and unaccustomed to War; and for that Reason it was not to be imagi∣ned that the Grand Vizier would put all to the hazard of a pitched Battle. How∣soever,The Chri∣stians pre∣pare to re∣ceive them. not to despise an Enemy, the Ge∣nerals considering hereof at a Council of War, dispatched immediately express Or∣ders to the Cavalry, quarter'd in all parts of the Upper Hungary, where was no ap∣prehension of any Enemy, to march unto the Camp; and accordingly General Dune∣waldt, with several Regiments of Horse un∣der his Command, and Count Caprara, and General Heusler with their Troops, and Count Budiani with about Two thousand Hungarians, all valiant and veterane Sol∣diers, appeared at the Rendezvous, and with all expedition marched towards the Enemy, with intention to give them a stop in their Way towards Buda. The Ban or Governor of Croatia, having given Advice to the Generals, that he had raised the Mi∣litia of that Country for the Service of the Emperor, was commanded to March to∣wards the Bridge of Esseck, and joyning with the other Forces, to make Head and Op∣position to the Grand Vizier in his March. The rumour and report of the Grand Vi∣zier's approach with all his Army did daily increase, and as a certain Fore-runner there∣of, several Thousands of his Horse were advanced very near to discover the Force and Actions of the Christians: Whereupon a Council of War being called of all the Generals, it was concluded to counter∣mand the Advance of the Troops, and ap∣point them to appear at a general Rendez∣vous, where it was plainly manifested, how greatly the numbers were abated; and there∣fore since the great Line of Circumvallation was perfected and well flanked with strong Redoubts, Spurs and other defensible Works, they order'd, that the same should be main∣tained by Three thousand Foot, which were sufficient to give a stop to any Attempt, which might be made upon the Camp: And the Imperial, Bavarian, and Branden∣burger Cavalry, were commanded to lodge on the Hills and rising Grounds which were round the Town: And the Heydukes were encamped along the Wall of the old Town, extending themselves from the Fort situate on the Danube, unto the Trenches of the Brandenburgers. Having thus secured their Camp, and put every thing in a readiness to receive the Enemy, in case they should attempt to force their Lines; they proceeded on all sides to perfect their Works on the Breaches.The Bava∣rians point all their Batteries against the great Tow∣er. The Bavarians being piqued in point of Honour for the Foyl or Disadvantage they had re∣ceived about two or three Days before, had incessantly fire on the great Tower with their biggest Cannon; and from another Battery near adjoyning plaid continually on the Breach of the Wall, which as yet was not wide enough for the Attack; and be∣cause the Situation of the Place was such, as made it almost inaccessible and too dan∣gerous to the Soldiers to ascend over the Rocks and Ruines which lay in the way, the Elector resolved to point all his Can∣non against the Castle, as also his Bombs of greatest weight, with design to beat down the Walls, and with the Ruins thereof to make the Ascent thereunto more easie and secure; with which, and some Mines which were blown up, that ancient and stately Edifice was almost destroyed. The News of the daily approach of the Vizier and his Army, caused the Christians to be more watchful and vigilant than be∣fore, and scarce gave the Generals any rest or repose by Day or Night free from Alarums, which the Duke of Loraine sustained in a manner rather Miraculous than Natural;The Chri∣stian Camp alarum'd. for being scarce recover'd of a Fever, the present state of Affairs required him to re∣double his Cares and Vigilance; which agi∣tation of Mind was able to have droven a confirmed Health into the extremities of Heat and feverish Distempers; but God, who intended him for the glorious Instru∣ment of subjecting this strong City, gave him strength for his great Work; so that notwithstanding the expectation of the Vi∣zier hastning to the Relief, a general Assault was made at every Breach, which continued for the space of two hours; in which the Defendants behaved themselves with such Gallantry, that the Duke of Loraine caused a Retreat to be sounded, rather than un∣profitably to lose the Lives of his Soldiers, of which they began now to be sensible of the great Abatement: Howsoever something was gained by this Assault on the right side of the Tower, adjoyning to the Castle at the corner of the inward Wall, where they lodged forty Men. In this Conflict not many Men were killed, but many were wounded, both Officers as well as common Soldiers, and particularly Count Leopold of Herberstein, and Serjeant Major Bischoff∣shausen; and on the Quarter of Bavaria, the Prince of Savoy, and Prince Lewis of Baden, both slightly wounded.
By the motion of the Seraskier, it seem∣ed as if his Intentions were to enter his Succour and Relief into the Town by the Bavarian Quarters;Skirmishes between the Turks and Bavarians. and some Thousands of Turks appearing on the rising Grounds and sides of the Hills, put themselves into a po∣sture, as if they intended to Engage; but the Trenches were so well guarded and for∣tified, that there seemed to be little danger of forcing Succour by that way into the City: Howsoever, there happen'd daily Skirmishes, in which diverse were killed on one side and the other; and particularly a Turk well mounted and habited, advancing with more than prudent Gallantry, was laid dead on the Ground;Letters ta∣ken. and being stripped by the Soldiery, there were some Letters found about him from the Grand Vizier to the Pasha of Buda, signifying that his In∣tentions were to force some Quarter of the Enemy, and thereby introduce the Suc∣cours designed for Relief of the Place; and that in the mean time with a Body of Eight thousand Tartars, to stop the Passage of all Provisions to the Christian Camp between Strigonium and Buda. Upon this Discovery, the Duke of Loraine and the Generals re∣solved to guard their Trenches with Twen∣ty thousand Men, posted in the most ad∣vantagious Places,The Chri∣stians pre∣pare to give Battle to the Turks. and to draw out all the remainder of the Army into the Field to meet the Vizier, and shew their readiness to give him Battle; for thô the Turks were reported to be Seventy thousand strong, they were not in reality above Forty thou∣sand able to bear Arms; against which the Duke of Loraine forming his Van-guard of Four thousand Talpatzes and Hungarian Hus∣sars, flanked by a part of the German Horse, marched forth in view of the Enemy. Af∣ter some Skirmishes with loss of Men on both sides, the Turks retired, carrying away with them some Heads of Cattle, which the Hussars endeavouring to recover, were beaten back with the loss of thirteen Men. After this, the former Resolution was changed, and it was concluded at a general Council of War, to keep within, and guard their Trenches, which were well fortified, until they were certainly assured of what Strength the Vizier was; according to which Resolution, they continued to Forti∣fy their Lines of Circumvallation with Re∣doubts, on which they mounted several Field-pieces. August.The 9th of the Month the Turks ap∣peared on the Hills, opposite to the Bava∣rian Quarters, in greater Numbers than be∣fore, and after an Engagement with the ad∣vanced Troops, made their Retreat as they had done the Day before; and in the re∣turn to their Camp, they met with a Party of about an Hundred and fifty Hungarians, which were sent to discover the Enemy; they cut them all off, thirty only escaping, of which most of them were wounded; and at the same time the Besiged made a Sally on the Bavarian Quarter,Various Successes. and killed about Eighty Soldiers, besides some Officers. On the 10th the Bavarians had finished their Line of Circumvallation, adjoyning to that of the Imperialists, and had wholly guarded themselves from all Attempts of the Enemy by a very deep Ditch: Howsoever, things not being so secure, but that the Enemy might be able to attempt the entring Suc∣cours by way of the River, the Water of which was very low; they fortified that part also with some Boats at a convenient distance from each other, and with some Turn-pikes called Chevaux de Frise On the 11th certain Intelligence was brought, that the Grand Vizier was encam∣ped about five Leagues off; and the same Day Two thousand Turks appeared oppo∣site to the Bavarian Quarter, about the same place as before; to discover which and their numbers, a Detachment was sent, but they were soon forced to retire in hast, the Enemy descending in numbers, which were too unequal a Match for them. The three Mines on which much Work was bestowed being charged with Five thousand weight of Powder, were now ready; and on the 12th were fired,A Mine fired. but not with such good effect as was expected, having only shaken the inward Wall, and some few of the Pali∣sadoes; so that it was believed, that the Turks had discharged them of the great∣est part of their Powder, by which disap∣pointment, the Assault which was intended, was countermanded, and the Miners or∣der'd to begin a new Work. The After∣noon of the same Day, the Vizier appear'd and encamped on the Banks of the Danube,The Vizier appears. being as some Deserters reported about Fifty thousand strong; at the sight of which, the Besieged being encouraged, made a Sally with about an Hundred Horse and Foot, upon Three hundred Horse of the Van-guard; of the Imperialists, who feigning a flight, drew them at some distance from the Town, and then returning upon them, cut the greatest part of them in pieces. On the 14th, the Turks drew out their whole Army into Battalia, and Detached Six thousand Men under three Pashas, a∣mongst which were Two thousand Janisa∣ries, with Orders to make their Way into the Town,A Party of Turks com∣manded to enter the Town. by the Imperial and Brandenbur∣ger Quarters. Against whom the Duke of Loraine sent the Regiment of Hungarians Commanded by Palfi, and the Regiments of Schultz, Serau, and Lodron to charge the Enemy and begin the Fight: The Hungari∣ans upon the first Shock or Charge began to
give Ground; but Baron Marcy putting him∣self at the Head of the Regiment of Schultz, gave a stop to the Flight of the Hungarians, until such time as Count Dunewalt came up with the Regiments of Taff, Lodron, Neu∣bourg, Stirum and Staremberg, which be∣ing joyned in a Body, charged the Turks with that Fury and Bravery,The Turks defeated. that they totally defeated and put the Turkish Horse to Flight, by which the Janisaries being abandoned and laid open, were almost all cut off and de∣stroyed. The Elector of Bavaria with his Horse pursued them to their Camp, where Rallying again they endeavoured to charge the Christians in the Flank; which when the Duke of Loraine perceived, he made a stand or a halt, and drew out some Forces from the Lines, which he caused to march towards their assistance; but the Turks having re∣ceived the first Fire retreated to their Camp, whither it was thought fit not to pursue them, but rather to conduct the Troops back to the Camp, being much tired and wearied by continal Watchings, having for the space of three Days and three Nights, been always on the Guard with Arms in their Hands. The Victory was very clear and signal, for the Turks lost eight Pieces of Cannon, and Forty Standards, and Two thousand and two hundred dead Bodies were accounted by the Duke of Loraine himself lying in the Field, where the Battle was Fought, which he caused to be buried, to prevent a putrefaction in the Air; and all this with the loss only of about Two hun∣dred Men killed and wounded, amongst the latter of which were the Count of Lodron, a Major, and two Captains. After this happy Success all the Cannon were discharged, and the Colours taken from the Turks displaied, and many Heads of those who had been killed, were set upon Pikes, and shewed to the Besieged to in∣crease their greater Terrour and Despair. Notwithstanding all which, the Turks aba∣ted nothing of their Courage; the Grand Vizier giving the Christians every Night Alarms, the better to discover with what Force and Vigilancy the Lines and Avenues were Guarded.Two thou∣sand Turks force their way into the Town. At length, on the 20th of August about break of Day, Four thousand Turks, of which Two thousand were Janisaries mounted on Horse-back, made a vigorous Attempt by the Vally of St. Paul, and with great Fury assailed those Guards, which they not being able to sustain, gave them Way, and permitted them in a full carrear, to Ride up to the Walls of the Town: At this confusion of the Guards, and the Noise made by the Janisaries, the Regiments of Caprara and Heusler came, and renewed the Fight with them, and killed several hun∣dreds of the Turks, who as they advanced farther into the Approaches, were so plied by the Musquetiers, that most of them were slain: Howsoever, about Two hundred of them made their Way into the Town by the Ba∣varian Quarter: Which so animated the Defendants, that they made and discharged four Vollies of Shot for joy round the Town: Though this small Recruit was rather a Weakening to them than any Reinforcement. This Attempt seemed so desperate to the Turkish Soldiery, that the Vizier could not prevail with any Man to undertake it, with∣out a Largess of Thirty Dollars in hand paid to every Janisary, and promise to any that should get within the Town,The reward promised for the Ser∣vice. to have his pay doubled during his Life, and to be freed from going ever more to the War: Of which sort of People there are above Fifty thousand in the Ottoman Empire, called Oto∣racks, or as in Latin Milites immeriti. All this interrupted not the Bavarians in their Works,Batteries raised on the Rondel. or in the Batteries they had raised on the great Rondel, by which they very much annoied the main Castle, which when the Turks observed, they planted one of their biggest Pieces of Cannon on the highest part of the Wall, which they ha∣ving charged with Musquet Bullets, Iron, Stones, &c. did great execution on the Sol∣diers, which maintained and guarded the Ron∣del of the Tower: Howsoever, not to give ground or abandon so advantagious a Post, the Elector of Bavaria with advice of the General Officers, resolved to Assault the Tower, which was half ruined and already demolished, so as thereby to gain the ad∣vantage of an upper Ground: The Assailants so bravely behaved themselves,August. That on the the 22d without any regard to the dif∣ficulty and ruggedness of the Ascent, or the opposition the Turks made, they sur∣mounted the Breach and killed about One hundred Men, and made themselves Ma∣sters of the Tower:The Tower taken. In the mean time whilst this was in Action, the Duke of Loraine, and the Brandenburgers caused an Alarm to be given without, and with continual Fi∣ring of their Artillery and Vollies of Shot, kept the Enemy at a distance. The Pasha of Buda finding himself nearly urged, and pressed by the loss of so im∣portant a place, from whence the Christi∣ans could now shoot into the Town; he ap∣plied all his endeavours to dislodge them: But the Bavarians having str ngly posted themselves,The Turks endeavour to dislodge the Bava∣rians. being assisted with the advan∣tage of the rising Situation, vigorously re∣pulsed all the Force which the Turks could make upon them, and easily threw them down head-long from the Scaling Ladders which they had erected. This place was gained by the Bavarians without much Blood of the Common Soldiery, but Duke
Henric of Saxon Mersburg was in that Acti∣on wounded in two places; and General Rummel of the Bavarians was slain by a Musquet-shot in the Approaches, which ought to have been made deeper by three or four Foot, so as to cover the whole Body of a Man; he was an excellent Sol∣dier, and a brave Man, and therefore much lamented by his Electoral Highness, and the whole Army. Nothing could more annoy and vex the Defendants, than the taking and possessing this Tower, which render'd the Case and State of the City almost desperate; so that no hopes remained, unless they were suc∣cour'd and reliev'd by the Army of the Grand Vizier, whom to advise of their Ex∣tremity,Two Mes∣sengers sent from the City to the Grand Vi∣zier. two Messengers were dispatch'd out of the Town, one by the way of the Water, and the other by the Land side, both dis∣guised in the Hungarian Habit. The first was discover'd swimming over to the Island of St. Margaret's; and being pursued was taken, but his Letters he had first thrown into the River: Howsoever, being brought before the Generals, he confessed and decla∣red the low and desperate Condition to which the City was reduc'd; and that it could not hold out much longer unless spee∣dily Reliev'd; and that another Messenger was sent to acquaint the Vizier thereof by Word of Mouth, letting him know, that it was not sufficient to appear before the Town,One of them is ta∣ken. and flatter them with the hopes of Succour, unless also he could force the Ene∣my to raise the Siege; and that the late Recruit of Two hundred Men, who brave∣ly made their way into the City, was but a small Help and Comfort to a Garrison already wasted, and almost totally consu∣med by a long Siege. That the Castle was in a manner lost, since that the principal Towers and Bulwarks of it were possessed by the Enemy: And in short, that those who re∣main'd alive, were wearied out with con∣tinual Watchings, and every Day dimi∣nish'd by Cannon and Musquet-shot, by Bombs, Fires, and Carcasses continually thrown into the Town. All these Matters being reported before the Generals, they conceived certain hopes of putting a speedy end to their Labours and Dangers: Howsoever, therewithal they so far consulted their own Condition, that they concluded it very necessary, before any thing was farther attempted, to expect the coming of that Body of the Army under Count Scaffemberg, and the Twelve hundred Swedes, which were now on their March, and near at hand. At length Scaffemberg being come with a Reinforcement of Eight thousand Men, besides the Swedes, raised the Spirits of the whole Army, and put the Generals into a capacity of executing the Designs they had already plotted and contrived.Eight thou∣sand Men come to the  Camp. On the Loraine Quarter a Bridge was made near the great Tower, leading to∣wards the inward Palisadoes of the Enemy; and to conserve it from fire, they covered it over with Earth: The like was also per∣formed on the Bavarian side; but whilst these things were preparing, a stop was put thereunto by an unexpected and vigorous Sally which the Besieged made, for dislodg∣ing the Soldiers which had possessed the Tower. Three Attempts were made there∣upon with the greatest fury and desperation imaginable, throwing Granadoes, Sacks of Powder, and artificial Fires, composed of Sulphur, Pitch, and all sorts of burning and fetulent Matter; notwithstanding which, they were most vigorously repulsed with much loss. The Elector considering the dangerous Post, which his Men had under∣taken to defend, thought sit to withdraw his Soldiers from the Bulwark, that he might with more advantage batter the great Tow∣er with his heaviest Cannon, which were so hotly plyed, that the whole Tower was beaten down, and the Enemy thereby made uncapable to offend from those Works. The Bridge of which we spake, being finished on the side of the Imperialists, with the Batte∣ry on the Rondel, the inward Palisadoes were broken down, and the Breach widen'd above Forty Paces; so that now all had been surrender'd, had not the Vizier comforted the Pasha with Assurances, that he and the Seraskier had resolved to attempt the Camp in three places at the same time; and that the most forcible one should be given at the Water-side, where 'twas believ'd the least Opposition could be made. Upon this Ad∣vice, the Water-side and Banks of the Ri∣ver were well fortified and secured, and a strong Chain stretched over the Water be∣low the Bridge of Boats, from the Shoar to the Point of St. Margaret's Isle, to obstruct the Passage of Spies and Messengers, who used to swim over the Water with Intelli∣gence, and which also might serve to give a stop to the Cavalry, in case they should attempt any thing on that side. The City being now in a languishing Condition, the Grand Vizier resolved to make his last Effort; and having chosen out of his Army Three thousand of his bravest Soldiers, which he encouraged with Thirty Dollars a-piece paid them in hand, and with promise of Increase of their daily Pay, du∣ring Life, to such as should make and force their Way into the Town; and at the same time another Body was ordered to enter the Line, at the place which they had lately attempted. The Three thousand descended by way of the Vally called Shamboiuck, and
with great Fury fell in upon the Guards of the Imperialists; but were so well received by the Baron of Asti, with his Talpatz and Hussars, and by General Heusler, with his Regiment, that they were vigorously re∣pulsed. After which they made an Attempt on Count Caprara, and again on the Quar∣ters of the Duke of Loraine, but in all places were ill treated, and came off with a great loss of Men. In the mean time, the second Body of Turks assaulted other parts of the Army, which increased the heat of the Fight; to succour which, the Duke of Loraine detach'd all the Forces which were about him, remaining alone only with two Assistants; but the Battle growing hot, and the Turks endeavouring in diverse places to break into the Line, the Duke of Loraine put himself at the Head of two Battalions of Brandenburgers, whose Example gave Life and Courage to the whole Army. But whilst this Fight was mannaged in diverse Squadrons, which confusedly ran from one side to another, some of them had the for∣tune to force the Line towards the Wall of the lower City; but passing to the Line of Contravallation, they met there such Vol∣lies of Shot, and continual Firings, that knowing not which way to retreat, they fell into the Squadrons of Baron Marcy and Serau, by whom the greatest part of them were kill'd upon the place; and those which escaped were so confused, that being dispers'd about the Fields, they knew not which way to take. Some of them happen'd to fall in with the Brandenburgers, others into the general Quarters, where being encompass'd on all sides, they were miserably cut to pie∣ces and slain, not so much as their Servants, or Grooms of their Horses escaping. The Besieged in the mean time being Spectators of all that passed, designed by a most vigo∣rous Sally to meet their Succours, but were so warmly encounter'd by the Bavarians, that they were forced to Retreat with pre∣cipitation and disorder. The Body which the Turks kept for a Re∣serve, observing the unfortunate issue of these Conflicts, durst not adventure to make another Attack, but retired back to their Camp. The Turks lost above One thousand Men kill'd on the place, and Twenty five of their Colours were taken. Howsoever, this Advantage was not obtained without some considerable loss on the Christian side, which was the more to be lamented by the Death of Baron Marcy, who after having kill'd several Janisaries with his own hand, receiv'd two Cuts on the Head with a Cy∣meter, and one on his Shoulder, which thô at first were not esteem'd Mortal; yet the Wounds being neglected, and the Cure thereof not much regarded, he Died thereof in a short time afterwards, to the great Grief of the whole Camp, which much la∣mented the loss of so brave a Soldier. The Vizier being informed of this unfor∣tunate Success, immediately gave order to the Janisaries of his Guards, which were kept for a Reserve to renew the Fight, and attempt once more to give succour to the Town; but the March of these fresh Forces being discovered by the General Count Pic∣colomini, who was at the Head of five Regi∣ments of Horse, divided into Twenty five Squadrons, he marched boldly to meet the Enemy; but the Turks upon appearance of the Van-guard of the Christians sounded a Retreat, and returned back to the Vizier's Camp. Whilst these several Conflicts and Skir∣mishes were acting in the Field, the Attacks upon the Town were not neglected; and on the side of Loraine they had advanced their Lodgment to the Breach of the inward Wall, not above three Pikes length from the Palisadoes; but because it was necessa∣ry to attack the Town with extream Reso∣lution and Force, without which it could not be taken; and that in the mean time, no Interruption should be given to the As∣sault by the outward Force of the Enemy; it was resolved at a Council of War, held by all the Generals then present, that the Lines of Circumvallation should be made deeper, which being well guarded, would secure the Soldiers from the Enemy with∣out: And in the mean time, to keep the Design secret, a Report was given out that the Christians intended to give Battle to the Turks; upon the News of which, the Vizier applied himself to fortify his Camp, and the Besieged neglected to provide for their last Defence. It being now the second of September,Septem∣ber. the Artillery continued still to play upon the Breaches with Chained-shot, and to burn the Palisadoes with Bullets red-hot, and to amuse the Besieged with the report of the Battle; so that several Troops were drawn out of the Lines, as if all the Army intended to take the Field; when on a sud∣dain, upon a Signal given by firing six Pie∣ces of Cannon from the Swedes Battery,An Assault made in three pla- the Soldiers arose like so many Lions to attack the Breaches in three several places, of Loraine, Bavaria and Brandenburg; besides there were two other false Attacks. Baron Asti, with his Granadiers, was the first to mount the Breach, but being wounded in the Attempt, he resigned his Command to lead his Men to the Serjeant-Major of Die∣penthal. Never was any thing more brave∣ly assaulted, nor more courageously defen∣ded: For the Besieged, notwithstanding the late Stratagem to amuse them, still continu∣ed
their usual Vigilance, and oppose themselves with open Breasts against their Enemy; so that never was made a more brave and reso∣lute Defence than that of this Fortress of Buda. The Brandenburgers, not inferior in Courage to the Imperialists, were as forward as the o∣thers to mount the Breach; but both of them encountred an incredible Resistance by whole showers of Shot, Granadoes, Bags of Gunpowder, Stones, and even Swords and handy Blows, to which they came with the Enemy: But the Assailants being se∣conded by Reserves, and animated by the Presence and Example of their Generals, who marched at the head of their Men ra∣ther as Guides and Conductors,The Com∣manders Guide to the Soldi∣ers. than as Commanders, were so encouraged, that they resolv'd either now at last to enter the Town, or die on the Breach: The Duke of Croy, the Prince of Neuburg, with the Ge∣nerals Souches, Scaffemberg and Diepental, were like Common Soldiers engaged amidst the thickest of the Enemies; and the Duke of Loraine, who out of an heroick Spirit, was always present where was most of Dan∣ger, was one of the first to mount the Breach, being followed by the other Gene∣rals. The Fight grew so hot, and the De∣fendants so hardly press'd upon the Breach, that the Pasha-Governour of the Place, with the most select and choise Men of the Garrison came running to succour that part where the Enemy was just ready to make their Entrance; the Pasha fighting valiantly on the Breach, and giving undeniable Proofs of his Valour,The Pasha of Buda killed. was slain on the Ruins, and fell a Sacrifice rather to his own Master than to his Enemies; for had he escaped the Danger and Slaughter, 'tis probable he would have been ill received at Home, and his Death made shameful by the Hand of the Executioner, which was now made glo∣rious by the Sword of the Enemy. In fine, after a bloudy Fight on the Breach, which continued for the space of three quarters of an Hour, the Soldiers entred freely into the City,The City enter'd and taken. where a new Engagement began, the Garrison retreating from House to House, and from Wall to Wall, firing from Win∣dows and Holes, and all parts, being resol∣ved to sell their Habitations and Lives at the dearest rate they were able, until at length with great disorder they fled to the foot of the Castle Wall. The Imperialists being now Masters of the Town, made a most direful Slaughter of all they met; and being in the heat of their Fury, put Women and Children to the Sword. But the Elector of Bavaria met a strong∣er Resistance at the Castle; for the Turks who were still in their Trenches, and knew not as yet, that the Christians had enter'd the Town, defended themselves with their utmost Bravery, until at length the Bava∣rians redoubling their Force, became Ma∣sters of the remaining part of the Castle; when those who had forsaken the Breach,The Turks demand Quarter. were flying to take their Refuge in it; but now no Place or Sanctuary remaining to save the Miserable, some of them threw down their Arms, crying for Quarter, and others made Signs of Surrender, by the white Turbants which they took from their Heads, and display'd in the Air, and others thinking to save themselves in little Boats, and pass over to Pesth; but many of them were taken by the Bavarians, and most of them kill'd: But in regard that those, who were still in their Trenches, perceived that no Quarter was given, they apply'd themselves again to their Arms, and as de∣sperate Men, resolved to sell their Lives at the dearest rate; and having set Fire to diverse Places of the City, render'd it a most direful spectacle of Horrour and Confusion.Quarter not given In fine, all endeavours being made by the Ge∣nerals to stop the farther effusion of Bloud; the Soldiers not being as yet satiated with Revenge for the Death of their Companions; and the Prince Eugene of Savoy, who (with his Regiment of Horse was posted in a bu∣rying place to oppose the Turks, in case they should attempt any thing from the Vizier's Camp) was deaf to the Cries of the Conquer'd;by the Prof Savoy. for hearing that the Town was enter'd, and unwilling to lose any part of the Glory, or that his Sword should ap∣pear dry, and not colour'd with the Bloud of his Enemies, at the end of the Action, forsook his Post, and let loose his Soldiers, crying out to give no Quarter to the Jani∣saries, which to the number of about Six∣teen hundred defended themselves within the Trenches and Works of the Castle;but is gran∣ted by the Generals. but the Generals consulting together, con∣sider'd that the Night was coming on, that the Enemies Camp was in sight, that Fires were kindled and furiously burning in di∣verse parts of the City, and that the Con∣fusion was every-where great; they at length agreed, thô with some Opinions to the contrary, to grant Quarter to the Jani∣saries for their Lives only; the which they having accepted, and surrender'd themseves, were by a strong Guard conducted to one of the Moschs of the City, others to the chief Store-house, and others to a part of the Castle, where they were kept in Custo∣dy until the Day following. In the great Action of this Day, being the 2d of September, 1686, which gave the capital City of the Kingdom of Hungary into the Hands of the Emperor, after it had remained in Possession of the Turks ever since the Year 1529, when it was taken by Solyman; There were kill'd only Four
hundred Soldiers, and about Two hundred wounded; for where is a great Consterna∣tion,The num∣bers slain at the ta∣king of the City. there is seldom much Bloud spilt on the victorious side: Of the Turks about Three thousand might be slain, and Two thousand made Captives; of which last, the Kahya to the Pasha of Buda, or his De∣puty, was made Slave to the Elector of Bavaria; the Aga or Commander of the Janisaries to the Duke of Loraine; as also the Mufti, the Treasurer, the Hasnadar or Privy-Purse to the Pasha, the Secretary to the Pasha, with several other Officers of Note: Many others were taken and kill'd, who endeavour'd to make their escape over the River, some of them being overtaken by the Talpatz in their swift-rowing Boats; and o∣thers taken or kill'd by the Garrison of Pesth, at their landing on the other side; but still was the City all this Night in con∣tinual Flames and Confusion; for the Turks had conserved diverse Stores of Powder and Fire-works in places near the Attacks, which were not regarded by the Christians, when they first enter'd the Town; where the Fire encreasing, and running from House to House,The Store-House of Powder takes fire. at length touching the Maga∣zines, they blew all up with so terrible a noise, that the General began to suspect some Treason, and fear'd that all the Town was min'd in subterranean Vaults; but considering afterwards the place from whence the Blow came, it soon appear'd that it was all no∣thing but an Accident; howsoever, with that and other terrible Blows, very few Houses in the City remained standing, and the Roofs uncover'd; only the principal Church of the City was not much damnified, and the chief Magazine or Store-house was conserved by the great Care and Diligence of Count Rabata, Commissary General, with another containing vast quantities of Powder and other warlike Provisions. A stop being put (as we have said) by the Authority of the Generals, unto the Slaughter; and the Fury of the Soldiers growing cool, they began to hearken to the voice of their Commanders,Endeavours made to quench the Fire. who with good Words, and promises of Reward, prevail'd with them to apply themselves to the ex∣tinguishing of the Fire, which by the assi∣stance of God was in a few Hours over∣come. But a more wonderful deliverance by the Hand of God's Divine Providence, was the discovery of two Mines under the Castle,Two Mines discover'd. charged with Ten thousand Pounds of Powder, which the Turks reserved for their last and parting Blow, which had they taken Fire, would not only have destroyed the remainder of the City with the Walls and Bulwarks, but therewith buried the greatest part of the Assailants in the Ruins, and given a sad occasion or cause of Rejoy∣cing and Triumph to the surviving Con∣querors; but the Turks amidst this great Consternation had forgot these Mines, or else abstained from that desperate Attempt in hopes of Life. This was the Fate of this great and strong City of Buda, the Capital of all Hungary, and Residence of the Beglerbei of that King∣dom, under whom are Twenty Sangiacks: He is stil'd the Vizier of Buda, and esteem'd after the Grand Vizier Azem, and the Pa∣shas of Grand Cairo and Babylon,The Great∣ness and Power of the Vizier of Buda. (who are always entitul'd Viziers) the next in order of Superiority; and because his Station is on the Frontiers, and Neighbour to such a Formidable and Martial People, as are the Germans; they commonly chuse Men of Va∣lour and Conduct for that Employment, of which we have had a good Proof and Evi∣dence in the Person of the late Pasha, who decently Died on the Breach amidst the croud of Common Soldiers. This City was at first taken by Solyman the Magnificent, in the Year 1526; and af∣terwards in the Year 1527, was subdu'd by Ferdinand the I. King of Bohemia, Brother to Charles the V. In the Year 1529,The many Sieges which Buda sustain'd. Soly∣man regain'd it by Treachery of the Gar∣rison, and after it laid Siege to Vienna it self, which after many bloudy Assaults he was forc'd to raise in hast and con∣fused Precipitation. After which, Buda sustain'd eight several Sieges without any Effect. The first was by Ferdinand King of Bo∣hemia,  in the Year 1530, which he was forced to raise with shame and loss. The second was by the same King, un∣der  the Conduct of his General Leonard Festius, in the Year 1540; but the King dying, the Siege was raised. The next Year being 1541, the General  Rogensdorf laid Siege a third time to that City, which again was reliev'd by a pow∣erful Army under the Command of Soly∣man. The Marquess of Brandenberg, in the  Year 1542, made an appearance as if he had a design upon Buda, and came so near as to Attack Pesth; but being repuls'd thence with some loss, he return'd back into Ger∣many. In the Year 1598, the Count of Swart∣zemburg,  having by a Stratagem taken Rab from the Turks, marched thence towards Buda, and in the Month of October laid Siege thereunto, with the Forces of Ma∣thias the Arch-Duke, which after thirty Days time he was forced to raise, by rea∣son of the continual Rains: And what is observable, the Turks did the like at Wara∣din on the Frontiers, being under the same Inconveniences.
The Christians made an Attempt the 6th  time upon this City, in the Year 1602, un∣der the Conduct of General Rosworm: And thô they had ruin'd the Bridge over the Danube, and taken by force the City of Pesth, yet being overtaken by the rigour of the Winter-season, they were forced to desist from that Design. The 7th Siege was laid in the Year 1684, by Charles Duke of Loraine, Generalissimo of the Imperial Forces, and of the other Princes of Germany; which after many blou∣dy Assaults was again raised; as we have at large declared in the Historical Treatise of that Year. But now at length, after many Battles un∣fortunate to the Turks, this Fortress was forced to surrender to the said Duke of Loraine,The 8th time Besieged and taken. being over-whelm'd by the Power and Valour of the Christians, and taken in the sight of the Ottoman Army, Command∣ed by the Grand Vizier himself, in which was the Flower of the Turkish Troops; but having lost the best and bravest of their Soldiers in former Battles, and discourag'd by a Series of evil Successes, their Courage fail'd them, and no wonder, when they were generally possess'd with an Opinion, that God fought against them; in sense of which, so soon as the City was taken, the Vizier with such Precipitation raised his Camp and marched away, that he was forc'd to burn a great part of his Baggage to prevent the falling of it into the Hands of the Enemy. And indeed it was no wonder that the Vizier with fear and dread should hasten away, for the Duke of Lo∣raine had dispatch'd Count Budiani, with Six thousand Hungarians, to march in pur∣suit of him, whilst he with the other Generals render'd Thanks to God, and sang Te Deum for their Successes in the great Church, Dedicated to St. Stephen King of Hungary. In the mean time the Command of this important City was committed to the Charge of General Beck, with the Assistance of the Lieutenant Colonel of the Regiment of Salm,The Com∣mand of Buda gi∣ven. and of Biscofshausen, Serjeant-Major to Diepenthal, with a Garrison of Three thousand Five hundred Germans, and a Thousand Hungarians: The first Work to be done, was to clear the Streets of the dead Bodies, which was perform'd by the Turks and Jews, who were made Prisoners; those Bodies which were Turks and Jews, like themselves, by Command of their Task-masters, they threw into the River, but the Bodies of the Christians were de∣cently Interr'd. The next Business was to demolish the Works, repair the Breaches, to fill up the Trenches, and level the Lines: But the chief Prisoners, and Persons of Quality, were conducted by Count Rabata to the Emperor at Vienna, where the Joy and Triumph of that Court was much in∣creas'd at the sight of such considerable Captives. The Spoyl and Plunder of the City could not amount unto much, by reason that the greatest part of the Housholdstuff and Move∣ables was consum'd in the Flames: Howso∣ever, there were some who had the fortune to seize considerable Sums both of Gold and Silver. After which the Place being visited and survey'd in all parts by the two Generals,Stores found in the Town. they found therein above Four hundred Pieces of Cannon of great weight; of which there were four of vast bigness, carrying an Hundred and fifty Pound Bul∣let; to which the Christians afterwards gave the Name of the four Evangelists; besides, there were twenty Mortar-pieces, and Pro∣visions and Ammunition for about a Month longer. The Generals having refresh'd their Ar∣mies in Buda for the space of three or four Days, on the 6th of September they march'd towards the Vizier with Twenty thou∣sand Foot and Twelve thousand Horse; of whom Count Budiani (as we have said) being dispatch'd before, gave an account,The Army marches a∣gainst the Vizier. that the Vizier having visited and reinforc'd the Garrison of Alba Regalis, or Stultwissem∣berg, had taken his March with all expedi∣tion towards the Bridge of Esseck; and that his Army was reduc'd to a very small num∣ber, being deserted by the Country-people and Handycraftsmen, whom they had forc'd to the War; so that the Vizier not know∣ing otherwise in what manner to save him∣self, encamp'd with all the advantage he could about three Miles distant from the Bridge of Esseck, upon the little River of Sarwitz, having his Rear guarded by a Bog or marshy Ground, intending there to re∣main, until he saw and discover'd the De∣signs of the Enemy, who could not in that advantagious Post force him to an Engage∣ment. The Duke of Loraine being with the Imperial Army encamp'd at Tolna, about three Leagues distant from the Vizier, whom he could not force nor perswade to Fight; he detach'd Eighteen Regiments under Command of Prince Lewis of Baden, with Orders to Besiege the Town of Quin{que} Ec∣clesiae, whilst he with the remainder of the Army passed the River, with a Bridge of Boats, at Tolna, taking his March towards Pesth; and in his way seized on the Town of Hatwan, which the Turks had abandon'd,Hatwan surrender'd. and set on Fire; but the Christians entring therein before all was reduc'd to Ashes, they extinguish'd the Fire, and sav'd the rest, and found therein seventeen Pieces of Cannon.
Thus did the Imperial Arms proceed with a prosperous gale of Fortune, nothing stand∣ing before them, but all yielded to the con∣quering Eagles; for Prince Lewis of Baden in his March, made himself Master of Si∣mon-Torn,Simon Torn taken a Fortress encompass'd with a Ditch of thirty Paces broad, and that also defended by a Marsh quite round; the Pas∣sage over which is made by a Bridge of Three hundred Paces long, and the Castle is built of Free-stone, with Fortifications after the ancient Fashion. In this Place were sixteen Pieces of Brass Guns, and one of Iron, Twenty six Granado-shells, and Twenty five Tuns of Gun-powder. Then without farther loss of time he proceeded to Kaposwar,and Kapos∣. which he Pillag'd and Burnt, the Castle only excepted: And being reinforc'd by Count Scaffemberg and some Troops of the Croats, which joyn'd with him, they march'd together towards Quin{que}; Ecclesiae; and being come near the Place, a Detachment of Three thousand Germans and Croats was made to take a View of the Situation and Strength of the Town; which they finding to re∣main in a secure Condition, enter d it by Surprize, and put an Hundred Turks to the Sword, the rest flying to the Castle for Refuge, after they had set fire to the City in four places;Quin{que} Ec∣clesiae ta∣ken. but the Dragoons scaled the Walls, and with their Swords in their Hands cast themselves into the Place, and open'd the Gates to give entrance to the other Troops. After which the Fire was put out, and considerable Booty, and rich Plun∣der taken, and about a Thousand Christian Captives set at liberty. This Success was soon afterwards follow∣ed by the Siege of Segedin, by some Troops detach'd by Order of the Duke of Loraine, under Command of Count Caraffa, one of the Generals;Segedin be∣sieged. who, coming before the Place, in a short time rais'd four Batteries, and mounted his Cannon thereupon, which were brought from Zolnock; but Forage and Provisions growing very scarce in the Lea∣guer, Caraffa went himself to hasten the Provisions, leaving Count Walis, Major-General, Chief Commander of the Forces before the Town: In the mean time Count Walis receiv'd Intelligence, that Two thou∣sand Turks, joyn'd with a considerable Body of Tartars, were marching to raise the Siege, or to force Succours into the Town; he de∣tach'd six' Regiments of Horse and Foot, with some Croats, and a Regiment of Dra∣goons, under the Command of Count Vete∣rani; who having marched all the Night, by break of Day drew up his Forces in∣to Battalia, and with his right Wing charged the Tartars with such resolution,Veterani routs the Tartars. that he put them to flight, and kill'd great numbers of them in their Tents, and took Four or Five thousand of their Horses, with all their Baggage: Nor was the Colonel of the Re∣giment de Gotz, whose Incumbence it was to Charge the Turks, less successful in his Enterprise; for thô they had the advantage of a Palanca for their Defence, yet the Ins∣perialists (to whom nothing could now be difficult) did Storm it with so much Cou∣rage and Vigour, that they soon became Masters of it, killing Two hundred of the Three hundred Janisaries,A Body of Turks rout∣ed. which defended the Place; at the same time the Horse charging the others, forced them to fly in disorder, of which many falling into the Hands of Veterani, were kill'd without Quarter given to any. This Action was scarce over, be∣fore the Imperialists espied a great number of Turks, passing a Bridge which they had laid over the Danube, as if they had de∣sign'd to reinforce those Troops newly de∣feated, and to come in to their Assistance for the Relief of Segedin. Veterani resolving to charge them also, made a Detachment of some Regiments to hinder the run-away Tartars from attacking the Imperialists in the Flank, whilst he assail'd the Turks,  who were reputed to be Twelve thousand Men, Commanded by the Vizier himself. The Action was so bravely perform'd, that the Van-guard of the Turks was beaten, and fore∣ced to retreat to a Place where their Infan∣try lay under covert, supported by Six hun∣dred Janisaries, with Thirty Field-pieces, which were discharged with terrible Fire and Smoke upon their Enemies; but the Christians having receiv'd their Fire with undaunted Constancy and Courage, they assail'd the Turks and Tartars with such bravery, that they put them to flight.Another Body of the Turks de∣feated. In this last Encounter above Three hundred Janisaries were kill'd upon the Place, all their Artillery and Baggage taken, with their Timbals, which they sound before the Pashas, and many Colours, together with Five hundred Horse, and Two thousand Beasts of Burden, laden with Baggage and Provisions; and all this on the Christian side, with the loss only of a Hundred Foot Soldiers, and about Fifty Horsemen. After which Veterani returning to the Camp be∣fore Segedin, where Te Deum was sung; some Prisoners were releas'd to carry the In∣telligence of these Successes into the Town: And thereupon a Treaty being desired,Segedin taken. and Hostages given, it was agreed, That the Soldiers of the Garrison only should have liberty to march out with as much Baggage as every Man was able to carry upon his Shoulders and to be conducted in safety as far as Temeswar. Thus Segedin being ta∣ken, great quantities of Provisions were found therein, which served to augment the Loss, and increase the terrible Consterna∣tion
in the Turkish Army, and in the Court, and in all parts of the Ottoman Dominions. Nor did the Turks Misfortunes of this Year's Campaign end here, nothing being able to withstand a victorious Army. Prince Lew∣is of Baden divided his Army into two Bo∣dies; the first he Commanded himself, and march'd towards Darda, which is a Fortress built by the Turks, and serv'd to cover the Bridge of Esseck; the other Detachment was committed to the Conduct of Count Scaffemberg, with Orders to Attack Zyclos, the which he so well executed, that in five or six Days he took the Place, the Soldiers and Inhabitants Surrendring at discretion:Zyclos ta∣ken. In the Town were found Twelve Pieces of Cannon, with stores of all sorts of Provisi∣on and Ammunition. The Men were made Prisoners of War, but the Women and Chil∣dren were dispersed into several Cities and Towns under obedience of the Emperor. After the taking of Zyclos, the Count of Scaffemberg joyn'd again with Prince Lewis, who was now come before Darda on the first of November, where he understood the two Pashas, who had layn encamp'd on that side, with about Two thousand Five hun∣dred Men, were already pass'd the Bridge of Esseck; and that the Garrison of Darda had abandon'd the Place, and march'd the same way, carrying their Cannon and Pro∣visions, with them, and to hinder the pur∣suit of their Enemies after them, had beat∣en down and burnt a great part of the Bridge behind them. The Fort and the Bridge being both possess'd without any opposition, Prince Lewis burnt about Six thousand Paces more of the Bridge, not∣withstanding the Cannon-shot which they fired continually from the Town of Esseck, without any great loss or damage to the Imperialists,The Bridge of Esseck ruin'd. or the People of the Country, which came in to their Assistance; so that by what one side and the other had done, the Bridge was totally ruin'd. Prince Lew∣is having put a good Garrison into Darda, march'd to Zyclos, and thence to Kapeswar, which he took upon Conditions, that the Garrison should march out, and be conduct∣ed in safety as far as Sigeth. There were in that Town Twenty four Pieces of Can∣non planted, and the Magazines well stor'd with all sorts of Provisions and Arms. In this glorious manner did this Cam∣paign end in favour of the Christian Arms: And now it being time for both Armies to retire into their Winter-quarters, the losing Party had leisure to lament and quarrel, and lay the fault on each other, and the victorious Party to rejoyce and triumph. And so it was; for by this time the news of the loss of Buda, and the several Victories gain'd by the Christians, being come to Con∣stantinople, it struck all sorts and conditions of Men with a wonderful Consternation and Astonishment; and yet under this Affliction and pressure of heavy Taxes, they behav'd themselves with much Humility and Resig∣nation of Mind to the Will and Pleasure of God, acknowledging all these Miseries which had fallen upon them, the flights and turning of their Backs to their Enemies, the loss of their fortify'd Towns, and the Slaughter of their brave Soldiers, and va∣liant Men of War,The Turks humble themselves. to be all the essects of the Divine Anger and Vengeance upon them for their Sins. The Imaums or Parish-Priests, the Shecks or Preachers in their Moschs, the Religious Men, such as the Dervices, Ka∣lenderi, Nimetulahi, and others made di∣verse Processions, exhorting the People as they pass'd to Repentance and Amendment of Life, and particularly to lament their Sins of drinking Wine and unnatural Lusts, the common Wickedness and Vices of the People: And for better observation of their Law, which had been much neglected, it was commanded on pain of Death strictly to observe the Ramazan, which is the Month of Fasting, during which Month, no Man is by their Law, in the Day time, till Night comes, to tast Bread or drink Water: Every Friday in that Month, the Mufti and Kadees clothed in penitential Habits, were oblig'd to visit all the principal Moschs of the City, and to make Prayers for turning away the Anger and Displeasure of God: But the People and Soldiery were of another Tem∣per, being inclin'd to enquire after the Cause and Grounds of all these Evils, Slaughters, and Confusion. The News of taking Buda,Keep pediti∣ous Meet∣ing. and putting all the Garrison to the Sword, (which as reported) consisted of Eight thou∣sand Men, besides Women and Children, had fill'd all Constantinople with a most won∣derful Consternation; the common sort of Shopkeepers and Handycrafts-men ran to Coffee-houses, and Places of publick Meet∣ings to hear the News and Particulars of what had pass'd. The Kadees, who were Lawyers and Judges, and the Otorack Jani∣saries, who are like the Milites immeriti, or Soldiers with dead Pay, caball'd every Day together without the knowledge of the Grand Seignior, which so soon as he came to hear, he was affrighted, not knowing what might be the issue of such seditious Meetings, and thereupon doubling his Guards in the Seraglio with Bostangees, who are Gardiners,The Grand Seigmor af∣frighted at the Meet∣ings, and sends to them. and stout able Men, he sent to know the meaning of such numerous Assemblies; to which answer was made, That seeing to their Grief the extream Ruin and Danger, then threatning both the Person of his Majesty and the whole Empire, they thought it their Duty as Loyal Subjects and Slaves,
and true Musselmen and Believers to con∣sult together what Advices and Expedients they might with all Humility offer to his Majesty,Their An∣swer. for his own personal Conservati∣on, and for the Defence of their holy and true Religion, with the great Body of the Empire. The Grand Seignior, who dread∣ed the ill Consequences of such seditious Meetings, return'd to them a gentle Mes∣sage of Thanks for their Care and Love, desiring them to offer him such Remedies, which they in their Wisdom did judge con∣venient for cure of the present, and preven∣tion of future Evils; it being natural for the common sort of People in such cases to cast the Blame on the chief Ministers of State, they immediately reply'd, That the Musti was a bad Man, and had abused his Office, and that it was generally murmur'd in all places of the Empire,They offer Remedies. That his Ma∣jesty was in such times as these too expen∣sive in his Seraglio, and too loose in his Government, giving himself up to Hunting and Recreations, and forsaking as it were the Helm of Government, whilst the Vessel of the Empire was tossed amidst an Ocean of Miseries, and ready every Day to suffer Shipwrack. And that his Majesty did too much neglect his Imperial City of Constan∣tinople, gracing every little Place with his Presence, which made that Royal Seat be∣come desolate and so impoverish'd, that it was not possible to answer and pay the vast Taxes and Impositions which were charged upon it.The Grand Seignior ap∣proves thereof. The Grand Seignior seem'd to take all this that was said very kindly; and immediately depos'd the Mufti, and banish∣ed him to Prusa, and calling for one of the Kadileschers (who are Chief Justices) he cloth'd him with a rich Sables, and invested him with his Office: And looking more nearly about him to the main Chance, he recall'd the Orders he had lately given for a general Hunt on a certain Day, and a vast number of Grey-hounds, which with great Charge had been got together from all parts of the Empire, were let loose, and suffer'd to run without a Master through all the Streets of Constantinople: The Expences of the Seraglio were also much retrench'd, and the dayly Allowances reduc'd to one Moiety: And after this Example, the Ku∣stir-Aga, the Kimacham, and all the great Ministers of State made a Regulation in their Families: And to make this Reforma∣tion the more publick and notorious to the People, the Grand Seignior put on a more grave and penitential Face than ordinary, and frequented the Royal Mosques, going to one or other of them every Day with much Solemnity: This Reformation quieted the Minds of the Commonalty pretty well; but this and the News of the Vizier's co∣ming to Constantinople very speedily, to assist at the Councils for conserting Mea∣sures for the next Year's Campaign, terri∣fied the Ringleaders of the late Cabals, with an Apprehension of being called to an Account on score of their late seditious Meetings; for the Turks, who can easily dissemble with the Vulgar, and temporize during the Outrages and Fluctuations of the People, yet so soon as the Storm is ap∣peas'd, they never fail to question the Cause, and punish Captain Tom and his mutinous Rabble with Punishment agree∣able to their Demerit. As the Grand Seignior was affraid of his People,A Panick-fear possesses them at Constanti∣nople. and they of the Grand Seignior and Vizier, so likewise were they generally possess'd with a Panick-fear of the coming of the Enemy, which will plainly appear by this Instance. The Turks having surren∣der'd up Napoli di Romania upon Conditi∣ons to the Venetians; one of them was, That they should Transport the Inhabitants and Garrison of that City, to some Place within the Dardanelli, near to the Castles: The Venetians, in pursuance of this Article, embark'd all the Soldiers, with the Men, Women and Children, and transported them to the place appointed; to which when they began to draw near, so that many Colours of St. Mark were seen from the Castles, en∣tring into the Hellespont, the News thereof was posted from all hands to Constantinople, which put the whole City into a Consterna∣tion, and gave cause of Rumour every∣where, that the Venetians had already pas∣sed the Castles, and Reports flew up and down, that they were in a few Leagues, or as some fancied in sight of the Town. This put all Hands to work, and in a con∣fused manner, many Pieces of Cannon were mounted at the Seraglio Point, on the Maiden Tower, which is a little Fort built on a Rock in the Water, in the midway between Con∣stantinople and Scutari, where also Guns were mounted, and Soldiers and Inhabitants of the City posted in all places, where might be any suspicion or danger of the Enemies de∣scent or landing. This hurly burly conti∣nu'd for the space of two Days, by which time the truth of the Matter being known, and that the Venetians were retired, things began to be quieted, and the People to return to their own Habitations and Business. Thus have we done with the Campaign in Hungary for the Year 1686, which end∣ed very glorious for the Emperor: It rests now before we proceed farther, to take a view and survey of the Successes of the Venetians both by Sea and Land, which were not less prosperous than those in the parts of Hungary.
In the preceeding Years of this War, the Venetians made it their chief Business and Enterprise to render themselves Masters of the Morea, a fruitful and ancient Country, in which are many Provinces, and amongst them, that of Laconia, now call'd Maina, and the Inhabitants, Mainioti, a sort of People, who call themselves Christians, but live chiefly upon Spoyl and Robbery: In this Country the most considerable Places are, Calamata,Description of the Coun∣try of Mai∣na. Zarnata, Chielefa, and Passava, all which Places were subdu'd by the Veneti∣ans, and taken from the Turks in the pre∣ceeding Year of 1685, in despight of the Ca∣ptain Pasha, and in the sight of him and his Army,  as we have before related, which Disgrace being a Crime sufficient to cost him his Head, he resolv'd to save his Life if possible by recovery of Chielefa; to gain which, he began betimes his Campaign, and on the first of April, he invested the Place with an Army,The Turks invest Chi∣elesa. composed of Ten thousand Foot and Fifteen hundred Horse, commanded by himself and four other Pashas, with a great number of Labourers and Pioniers. At his first appearance before this Fortress, the Captain Pasha sent a Summons to the Go∣vernour, call'd Seignior Marin Gritti, Pro∣veditor extraordinary for the Maina, de∣manding with many Threats the Surrender of that Town. To which Seignior Gritti return'd a resolute Answer, That he and all his Soldiers would either live or die in De∣fence of that Place, not doubting but that the Omnipotent God would favour their just and brave Intentions. The Captain Pasha ha∣ving receiv'd this Answer, immediately rais'd a Battery, and began to fire upon the Town with six Pieces of Cannon; at which the Governour not being in the least dismay'd, put all things in order for a resolute Defence. The Turks ply'd their Batteries so warmly on the Town, that in the space of ten Days they had open'd a Breach wide enough for an Assault; which whilst they were preparing to do, the News being brought to Seignior Girolamo Cornaro, the General of the Islands, how that the Turks had invested Chielefa, he immediately gather'd all the Force which was then ready in Zant, consisting of divers Nations; and having embark'd 'em on a Fleet of Ships commanded by Seignior Lorenzo Ve∣nier, he sailed with a favourable Wind to the Morea. This News flew likewise with much speed to the Captain General Morosini then at Corfu, who, with like diligence, ha∣ving embark'd all the Forces he had there, and being assisted with a prosperous Wind, arrived in the space of four Days at the Place, where he design'd to make his De∣scent, and the Day following being the 30th of March, he landed Four thousand Men under the Command of three Major Generals, that is, Storf, and the Cavaliers Alcenago, and d' Andria. This unexpected News of the arrival of the Captain General surprized the Captain Pasha, and filled all the Turkish Camp with Fear and Confusion; so that at the very Name of Morosini,The Veneti∣ans relieve Chielesa. and the Christian Troops, they rais'd their Tents, and drew off their Camp, but with such hast and precipitation, that at a little distance from the Town, they left six Pieces of Brass Canon behind them, four of which were found in the common Way, and two were thrown down a Precipice, which afterwards were recover'd by the industry of the Ve∣netians. So soon as the Besieg'd observ'd the Enemy to raise their Camp, and to fly away with a Panick-fear, the Greeks and Mainiots pursu'd them, and kill'd above Four hundred of them; and the whole Body of the rest were dispers'd through the whole Country of the Morea; only the Captain Pa∣sha with some few Troops pitch'd his Camp in the Country near to Passava, where he labour'd to gather his dispers'd Troops. Towards the end of May,  the Auxiliary-Gallies and Forces being united to the Army and Fleet, under the Captain General; the whole Body of the Armada consisting of about Two hundred Sail, on the second Day of June appear'd in sight of old Navarin, which fill'd all that Country round with great Consternation. The Galleasses and great Ships led the Van, and serv'd to shel∣ter and protect the smaller Vessels in land∣ing their Men, which being enter'd on the Shoar, were drawn up in Battalia by the Art and Direction of that valiant General Count Conismarc, in sight of the People of Navarin. Morosini, according to his accu∣stomary Generosity, sent first his Summons to the Garrison to Surrender, before he thought fit to make use of his Force,The Vene∣tians invest old Nava∣rin. in answer un∣to which, they desir'd time to consider until the next Morning; and then they propos'd a longer Term, with design only to pro∣tract the Time, until they might receive Succours from the Seraskier, whom they knew to be not far distant with a consider∣able Force; of which the Captain General well considering, gave order to Count Co∣nismarc to advance with a great part of the Army towards the Town, and at the same time, he caused another Regiment to take possession of a Rock which forms the Port; and to plant a formidable Battery thereon; in which Matters whilst they were thus em∣ploy'd, the Besieged being greatly affright∣ed, set forth a white Flag, and dispatched immediately in their Admiral Gally, certain Deputies to treat on,The Inha∣bitants treat and surrender. and receive some rea∣sonable Conditions upon the Surrender, which, as they desir'd, were generously
granted by the Captain General. In pursu∣ance of which, the Inhabitants were permit∣ted to march forth with all their Bag and Baggage and small Arms, being not above Four hundred in number, of which One hundred were Soldiers, who were judged to be a sufficient Garrison to maintain a Fortress so naturally strong, and situated on a high and almost inaccessible Rock; and afterwards according to the Articles, all these People were transported to Alexandria in Egypt. Thus in a few Hours, without loss of Men, or the least effusion of Blood, did this old Fort of Navarin fall into the Hands of the Vene∣tians, in which were found Forty three Pie∣ces of brass Cannon, with many Arms, much Ammunition and Provisions. The Captain General having furnish'd the Place with a Garrison of an Hundred and sixty Men, un∣der the Command of Pietro Grioni, in Qua∣lity of Proveditor in ordinay, he immediate∣ly block'd up the Port, and guarded the narrowest streight of it, to secure the Pas∣sage for the more safe and easie Transport of Cannons, Mortar-pieces and Provisions unto that Place, where the Camp was pitch'd with design to Attack New Navarin, which was a Royal Fortress, and a place of greater Importance than that of Old Navarin. On the 4th of June at Night, the Gallies of Donado and Pizzamano, both Noble Vene∣tians, were the first to enter into the nar∣row Passage; on the first of which the Ge∣neral Count Conismarc was embark'd, who enter'd safely within the Port, thô several Pieces of Cannon were fired at them from a Ravelin, which trolled the Shot exactly on the Surface of the Water. These were follow'd by the Captain of the Gulf,The Vene∣tians enter the Port of Old Nava∣rin. with three other Gallies, who passed without any damage or loss; and on the 6th at Night, Cornaro, General of the Islands, en∣ter'd with his four Gallies also without other hurt, than the breaking some few Oars by a Shot from the Ravelin: The Cannon and Mortar-pieces, and other Necessaries for an Attack were first to be landed, which by the diligence, use and labour of the Slaves was presently effected, notwithstanding the ma∣ny Difficulties which interven'd; and a for∣mal Siege in a short time laid by the Indu∣stry and Valour of Captain General Moro∣sini, and the happy Conduct of Count Co∣nismarc, who had raised a Work, on which eighteen Mortar-pieces were planted, carry∣ing Bombs of Five hundred pounds weight, and on another advantagious Ground had raised a Battery of Twenty Pieces of Can∣non, carrying Fifty pound Bullet. Whilst these Matters were acting, a cer∣tain Greek was taken with Letters from the Town, directed to the Seraskier, whereby they gave him to understand, That thô Sefer Pasha, a valiant and resolute Soldier, was come to them, with a good Recruit both of Men and Ammunition, whereby their Garrison amounted to a Thousand Soldiers, and that nothing wanted either of Arms or Ammunition, yet that it was impossible for them to hold out long, unless the Siege was raised by a vigorous Force. Upon this Advice, General Conismarc re∣solved with the greatest part of his Troops to advance into the Country, and engage the Seraskier: Upon which Advice,Conismarc advances against the Seraskier. the Turks were so far from designing to disturb the Siege, that they raised their Camp, and retreated: Upon which also Conismarc thought fit to draw his Troops off, and return to the Siege; the Turks defending themselves, and refusing to Surrender upon any Summons or Force, which had hither∣to been applied, upon hopes as they con∣ceived of receiving speedy Succour and Relief from the Seraskier, concerning whom the Report was, that he was approaching towards the Christian Camp: In the mean time, the Captain General form'd all the Trenches and Traverses for an Attack, and bomb'd the Town with Twenty Mortar-pieces, and batter'd the Walls with six Pieces of Cannon, carrying Fifty pounds weight of Bullet. The Report of the Sera∣skier's near approach, confirm'd by the Scouts and other Messengers, and that the Turks with a Body of 10.000 Men were come within six Italian Miles of the Lea∣guer; Count Conismarc with a very strong Party advanced once again to meet and give them Battle, leaving the Cavalier Alcenago, one of the Major Generals, with a suffici∣ent Force to maintain the Siege. The next Day after,June. Count Conismarc had risen from before the Town, being the 14th of June, they found the Seraskier en∣camp'd with 10.000 Men, of which Two thousand were Horse, in a very advantagi∣ous Post, which seemed very difficult to be forced: Howsoever, the Venetians resolving to surmount all the Disadvantages with their Valour, enter'd into the Vally by a very streight Passage,He engages the Turks, where the Turks lay encamped, and forced them to engage in Battle, which lasted for the space of two Hours in a dubious Condition, it not ap∣pearing as yet to which side the Victory would incline: The Regiments of Corbon and Visconti, which were Dragoons, behaved themselves very bravely, and sustaining the heat of the Battle, the greatest part of the Loss fell on them; but the Saxons,and over∣throws them. and the Troops of Brunswick coming to their assist∣ance, with four small Field-pieces, forced the Enemy to quit the Field, and betake them∣selves to flight, leaving about Five hundred dead upon the Place, with all their Tents
and Baggage, besides many of them are wounded, amongst which the Seraskier himself was one; all which was perform'd by the wonderful Mercy of God, without any considerable loss on the Christian side. The Joy of this Victory was solem∣nized with Te Deum, and giving Thanks to God, and with many vollies of Shot and Cannon, which wholly disanimated the Be∣sieged, and put them into such a distracted Consternation; that with more lenity than before, they began to hearken to a second Summons,The Town Capitulates and Sur∣renders. which the Captain Gene∣ral, to spare farther effusion of Bloud, had been pleased to send to them. After divers Debates, and Articles propos'd, the Besieg'd declar'd themselves willing to lay down their Arms, and yield, on Conditions that three Days should be given to the Garrison to march out with their small Arms and Bag∣gage; and that shipping should be given to the Garrison and Inhabitants, to Transport them to the nearest Coast of Barbary. Whilst these things were in agitation, it un∣fortunately happen'd that by some Accident a Fire took in certain Houses, near a Ma∣gazine of Powder, which on a suddain blew up, and killed an Hundred and Fifty Turks, with Sefer Pasha, the Commander in chief of Navarin, and also six Christians, and about fifteen wounded without the Walls of the City. The Turks fearing lest this Accident should be esteem'd as done with Design, came trembling before the Captain General, solemnly protesting their Innocence in the Disaster, offering two other Hostages for performance of the Articles agreed; and lay∣ing their Standards and Keys of their City, at the feet of the Captain General, they were graciously received: And accordingly at the time appointed, above Three thousand Per∣sons were embarked, of which, One thousand were capable to bear Arms, and were con∣veyed over to the Coast of Barbary;The Vene∣tians take Possession of the Town. and the Venetians took Possession of the Town, and planted the Colours of St. Mark on the Walls thereof. It was not long after before the Fortress of Modon followed the same fortune; for the Christan Forces losing no time to pur∣sue their good Success,  on the 22d of June the Armada of Ships and Gallies shewed themselves before Modon; at which the Gar∣rison not seeming to be dismay'd, the Pasha, who Commanded in chief,Modon at∣tacked. returned a reso∣lute Answer, full of Bravery and Defiance, to the Summons sent to him by the Captain General: Upon which the Approaches were begun, and the Batteries raised, and Can∣nons plaid, and Bombs thrown by Directi∣on of that famous Engenier Mutoni, by which the Garrison being terrified, on the 7th of July they spread a white Flag, and surren∣der'd on Conditions, That in three Days they should leave the Place, and march out with Arms and Baggage; which accordingly was perform'd on the 10th of July,Modon surren∣dered. all the Inhabitants to the number of Four thousand, of which, about One thousand were Sol∣diers bearing Arms, abandon'd their Habi∣tations with sad and dejected Countenan∣ces; and, as was agreed by Articles, were all Transported into Barbary. The Town being seized, there were an Hundred Pieces of Cannon found therein, of which, Ninety one were of Brass, besides great Quantities of Powder and Ammunition, and plenty of Provisions. Thus good Success attending the Veneti∣an Arms, the Captain General resolved to pursue his Conquests, whilst Fortune incli∣ned to his side; and to proceed to Napoli di Romania, a Town anciently Famous, and celebrated for its happy and commodious Situation, in the most pleasant and richest part of all the Morea: The Greeks call it Anaplia, and Ptolomy Nauplia,The Des∣cription of Napoli di Romania. being seated at the bottom of a Bay, call'd in former times Sinus Argolicus, having a very spaci∣ous and secure Port for Shipping, and very commodious for Trade. The Town it self is situated with great Advantages, being defended on the one side by the Sea, and on the other by high and craggy Hills, ha∣ving Walls filled with Earth, much after the Modern Fortification; but without any Ditch; only at the Gate to the Land-side, there is a kind of a Ditch about six Paces broad, and about six Foot deep with Wa∣ter; it hath also something like a Counter-scarp, but inconsiderable; it hath no Draw-bridge, but only some Passages thereunto, which the Turks have made a little difficult to enter. The Venetians having refreshed their Ar∣my for a while before Modon, order'd Lo∣renzo Venier, Captain extraordinary, with three Ships of good force, to Cruise within the Archepelago, where he discovered, be∣tween the Islands of Nixia and Nicaria, a Fleet of Turkish Vessels call'd the Caravan, bound from Egypt to Constantinople, plying to Wind-ward, nine of which belonged to Constantinople, and four Merchant Ships from Rhodes and other Places, under Convoy of four Tripoli Men of War:A Fight at Sea. The Venetians immediately made up to them, and enga∣ged with them for the space of six Hours, with Damage on both sides, thô the Turks had much the worst, and at length with help of the Night, were forced to take Re∣fuge in the Port of Rhodes, and the Veneti∣ans afterwards retired into Trio, a Port on the Island of Parisi; where having taken some fresh Water, and mended their Rig∣ging, and other damages sustained in the
late Fight, they sailed again towards Rhodes; and being on their way between Lemno, and the Shore of Caramania, they espyed Two great Ships, and a Sayke; and making up, and passing some Broad Sides upon them, the greatest Ship ran a∣shoar, and set her self a Fire; all the per∣sons, being 130, escap'd a-shoar and sav'd themselves; the other Ship and the Sayke were taken by the Venetians; the Ship which was burned, was called Nachis, Com∣manded by Usuf of Rosetto, an Abyssine by Nation, very richly Laden; and the Prizes taken were well Freighted with Rice, and other Provisions very seasonable at that time for the support of the Venetian For∣ces, which by reason of contrary Winds, were long detained at Modon; but by help of their Oars, and assistance of the lighter Vessels, they arrived at Port Rogdi about Four Miles distant from Napoli de Romania on the 30th day of July, from whence they had a Prospect of the pleasant Gardens, and Fountains belonging to Assan Pasha: And here having Landed the 200 Foot, and 20 Horse,The Vene∣tians land near Na∣poli. which every Gally carried, their Orders were to march to Mount Palamida, which is higher than the Town, and com∣mands it, being within Musquet-shot; This Van was the next day followed by the whole Army, between most pleasant Streams, and Falls of Water. The Town being Situated, as before men∣tioned, was defended by 3000 men, of which 300 were lately sent in to recruit the Garrison; well fortified with Cannon, and with sufficient Stores and Provisions for their Maintenance; the Commander in Chief was Mustapha Pasha, with whom were Four Brothers, who were all Beyes, as also a Disdar, which signifies the Commander of the Castle, a Kadi or Judge, besides the Aga who Com∣manded the Recruits. Upon approach of the Venetian Army, all those who lived in the out-skirts and lower parts of the Town, amongst which were above 100 Families of Greeks, retired with their Goods into the upper parts of the City, and of a Fortress amidst the Rocks called Senonbolo. In the Port were Two Gallies unrigged, and dis∣armed, and all the Slaves and Soldiers taken out and lodged on a Rock not far distant, to the number of about 500 persons, one of which by the fall of a Bomb was sunk some days after the beginning of the Siege, and an English Ship called the Mary, which came from Alexandria, laden with Rice and Coffee, whose Masters Name was Edward Wall, submitted her self to the favour of the Captain General: Besides which there were also Two Galcots in the Port, one of 25 and another of 18 Banks or Seats for Oars, besides 40 Boats, or Barks of several sorts. In Landing the Bombs and Mortar-pieces, with all the Train of Artillery, they found little or no difficulty, or opposition, tho' the Seraksier shewed himself twice at a di∣stance, as if he had intended to have distur∣bed them in their Works, and raising Batte∣ries; nor did the Seraskier for that present do more, than only to fortify his Camp,The Castle Argos. which he had pitched near Argos, a Castle about 3 hours Journey distant from Napoli di Romania, the Way to which is all upon a plain, situate on a high Hill, at the foot of which is a Town containing about a hundred Houses, the Inhabitants of which, being for the most part Rich and Wealthy, had car∣ried up the best of their Houshold-stuff and Moveablss into the Castle above, which is well defended by its natural Situation; it had also 8 Iron Guns, and 10 Petreroes, some small quantities of Provisions in it, with a Cistern, not very well furnished with plenty of Water. On the 3d of August,August 1686. the Galeasses and Ships appeared in sight of Napoli di Roma∣nia, and forthwith Landed all the Horse and Foot, which were embarked thereon: And on the same day a Feluca belonging to Mahomet Pasha, a Bey, or Commander of Se∣ven Gallies, deserted, and came into the Ser∣vice of the Venetians; upon the Feluca were 7 Greeks, who gave intelligence, That the Captain-Pasha having received advice of the arrival of the Venetian Fleet, had in Two Nights time entred 300 Foot into Napoli: But to prevent the like for the future, seve∣ral Gallies with Four Felucas were detatch∣ed to guard and defend that Coast, and thereby to hinder and intercept all succours on that side. But because it was necessary also to dis∣lodge the Seraskier,The Vene∣tians march against the Seraskier. who on the other side appeared with several parties of Horse, and gave frequent disturbances to them in the Lines and Trenches which were then form∣ing; the Captain-General and General Chi∣nixmarch after due deliberation concerning the manner, resolved to give them Battel: To which end 2000 men selected out of the Ships, and Gallies, most of them being Vo∣luntiers, and Soldiers of Fortune, were land∣ed in a Creek, or covert place under the Conduct of Col. Magnanini, who was or∣dered to take a compass in the Night, and fall on the Turks in the Rear, whilst the main Body of the Army charged them in the Van: In the Morning Count Chinixmarch,August 16. having left 1500 Italian Soldiers in the Trenches, under the Command of Sargeant Major Count Repeta, advanced two miles with his Army drawn up in good order to meet the Turks on the Plain; the Seraskier seemed at first very ready and resolute to join Bat∣tel, advancing with a strong Body of 3000
Horse, and therewith to break into the Ve∣netians;The Turks Retreat, but finding a stout Repulse, they made a stand; and fearing lest they should be attacked in the Rear by the Marine Re∣giments, they made a Retreat; and taking up their Tents and Baggage, they marched away with all the Order that their hast would permit:And quit Argos. The People in Argos seeing the Seraskier and his Army, betake them∣selves to Flight, resolved to accompany them, and marched towards Corinth, where they arrived the next day, having lodged the Night before at a Village called Centera. In the Skirmish about 200 Turks were kil∣led and wounded, with very little loss on the Christian side: After which having plundered the Castle Argos of all the Goods which the Turks had left therein, in which they found about 60 small Boxes of Powder, they returned back again to their Trenches and Siege as before. In the mean time the City was burning in several places, being Fired by the Bombs and Carcasses which were thrown into it from the Palamida, and the Walls which were of Stone built after the ancient manner, were battered on all sides by the Cannon, which they were not able to resist; but that which caused the greatest Consternation in the City, and did the severest Execution,A Bomb blows up the Powder in the Town. was the fall of a Bomb into the Magazine of Powder, which blowing up beat all the Houses down which were near it on every side, killed many People, and filled with Earth and Ruins the chief Cistern which supplied all the Town with Water, so that the Defendants wanted now both Powder and Water, Two very principal necessaries for Life and Defence. The Captain-General conceiving, that after such a loss, the besieged would scarce have encouragement to defend themselves much longer, resolved to try their inclina∣tions by sending to them his Interpreter Fortis, with a Letter full of persuasive Mo∣tives, and good Articles, and Conditions, which should be performed upon surrender of the City; and seeing that their Seraskier had been beaten and durst not approach to give them Relief,The Vene∣tians offer conditions to the Town, they were exhorted before it was too late, to accept of the Mer∣cy and Clemency which was then offered to them. To these Summons the Governor without much consideration returned a speedy Answer,Their Answer. That they were very sensible that it was for their Sin, that God had cha∣stised and punished them; howsoever their Trust was, That God would deliver them, to whose Will and Divine Providence they re∣mained with intire resignation. The Bombs and Batteries continuing to do great Execu∣tion, by the obscurity of the Night, several Greeks and Reneges made an escape our of the Town,  came to the Captain-General, agreeing together in their Reports, that there was scarce a House in the Town which had not been damaged by the Bombs or Canon; and above 30 Houses burnt down to the Ground, 22 Churches and Chappels ruined with their Granaries, and Stores for Provisions: Many were the slain and wounded, and the people forced to drink brackish Water; and amidst all this misery and confusion, the poor Women in a distracted manner were running about the Streets, with tears and sighs, and screeks. Howsoever the Governor. Mustapha Pasha seemed to remain still firm and resolute to hold out unto the last, and to lose his Life for the sake of his Country.The Se∣raskier gives hopes of Relief. In the mean time the Seraskier fortified his Camp about Corinth, endeavouring there to encrease his Army; and to encourage the Besieged, he frequently caused certain Bodies to be seen from the Town, and parties of Horse to advance near to the Trenches; which thô they did nothing, yet it supported the Spi∣rits of the Defendants with some little glimmerings of hope. Whilst matters were in this posture, Admiral Duodo being re∣turned from the Coast of Barbary and Tripoli, where he had landed the People at Modon; he joyned the rest of the Fleet, as did also the same day Captain Pisani with 8 Ships from Argentiera. The Turks continued still to defend them∣selves, thô their offence was very weak, now and then firing a Bomb, whilst the Ve∣netians plyed them continually with Car∣casses and Bombs, having by this time spent at least 3500 on the place: the Batteries also plaid almost without any intermission, and the Lines and Approaches daily drawn nearer to the place; and they began now to throw Bombs into the Castle, which lies upon the Sea-side. This Castle is situate on a high Rock,A Castle near the Sea. with many Sands and shallow places round about it, so that it is impossi∣ble for any Vessel to approach near to it: The Walls are very high with some Bastions, and the place fortified with Seventeen Pieces of Brass Cannon, and Seven Iron Guns, and a Mortar-piece to throw Bombs; it was sup∣plied also with a good Cistern of Water, and Garrisoned with a hundred Foot Sol∣diers commanded by an Aga. The Christians continuing still with inde∣fatigable Labour, and fearless Hazards to press the Besieged, entred the Ditch of the Town on the 23d, which Adventure cost the Life of the Cavalier Alzenago, one of the Major Generals. About that time also seve∣ral others dyed of the Camp Disease;August. namely, Colonel Visconti, Major Cleist, as did also Signior Barbon Bragadino a Noble Venetian; and Count Charles, Nephew of General Chinixmarch, a young Gentleman
of great hope; likewise Girolamo Ghirardi, Captain of his Guard. On the 29th by break of Day, the Seraskier, with part of his Army,The Se∣raskier shews him∣self, and attacks the Christians in their Prenches. shewed himself on the Hill which descends towards the Right-hand of the Line, having his Left-wing re-inforced with a thousand Leventz or Soldiers of the Ma∣rine Regiments sent by the Captain Pasha; which having joyned the Army but a few hours before, they all in good order of Bat∣tel, being Ten thousand strong with Horse, and Foot, descended into the Plain, near unto the Line, charging with their usual cryes of Allah, Allah, and much fury on the Soldiers who defended the Trenches: But General Chinixmarch had with such ad∣mirable Order and Art so well disposed the Militia, that they repulsed the Enemy; and then Two thousand Sea-Soldiers, by Order of the Captain-General, coming to their succour, they put the Enemy into great confusion; and the Captain-General himself at the same time coming in person, with some Troops of select men,The Turks put to Flight. wholly turned the fortune of that day's Fight (which for Three hours had continued doubtful) to the Christian side, and caused the Turks to be∣take themselves to a shameful Flight, lea∣ving Fourteen hundred of their Companions behind them, killed, or wounded: In which Engagement the Venetians lost not more than Three hundred and Fifty men, killed and wounded. General Chinixmarch had his Horse shot under him, but he soon remounted another, and with great Vivaci∣ty, and Courage was present at all places, where the danger was most pressing: The Princes of Brunswick, and Turene, exposed themselves like brave Soldiers in all places which required their help and encourage∣ment; and having thus discomfited the Se∣raskier's Army, and caused them to with∣draw in disorder from the City, the Cap∣tain General to lose no time, left the pur∣suit of the Enemy, and returned to the Siege, causing the Batteries from all sides to play on the Town; and to terrify the De∣fendants, they shewed many Heads of the Turks ranked in File on the points of their Lances. The Besieged having seen the Se∣raskier, in whom was their greatest hope, routed and defeated before their Eyes, grew desperate of any relief or succour from thence, which caused them to display divers white Flags on the Walls, upon which all acts of Hostility ceased; and Two Turks came forth from the Town; and be∣ing conducted to the presence of the Cap∣tain-General,The Be∣sieged capitulate. they presented a Paper to him, subscribed by the Pasha, who was Go∣vernor of the City, declaring his readiness to make surrender thereof, provided they might have free liberty to march out with their Arms and Baggage,  and to be Trans∣ported thence to Troy, or to the Castles in the Dardanelli or Hellespont. And that the Two Turkish Gallies then in Port might also be freed, with their Chiurma, or Slaves and Equipage, which (as we have said) were retired into the Rocks, and fast places near the Town: But this latter would not be allowed, or granted by the Captain-General, nor any thing more, than what had been accorded lately to Modon and Navarin. The first step unto all which, was the Delivery of the Castle, situate on a Rock within the Sea, into which a Venetian Garrison was put immediately; and therein were found Seventeen Pieces of Brass Canon, and Seven of Iron, with a large Mortar-piece to throw Bombs; after this Eight Hostages were required of the most principal Turks of the City;And sur∣render. and then the other Articles were performed, which related to the Embarking the Soldiers and Inhabitants, who were accordingly Shipped and Transported to the Dardanelli, the ap∣perance of which so affrighted all the Coast at first, that the Alarum ran as far as Con∣stantinople, and put them there into that Consternation, of which we have before made a Relation. Thus was this and other famous Fortresses of Greece, which had for many years re∣mained in the Ottoman power, and with∣stood great and considerable Forces, in a few Months subjected to the Christian Arms, by the Valour and Bravery of the Captain-General Morosini, by the admirable Conduct of Count Chinixmarch, and the courage of those noble Princes of Brunswick and Turene, amongst which the German Sol∣diery, and all others did greatly signalize themselves in all their Atchievements. And thus we shall put an end to the Successes of the Year 1686, which have terminated so gloriously in honour of the Christian Arms, by which the Turks were reduced to that low and miserable condition, of which they were never before sensible, nor never accustomed unto, which made them the less able to bear the Evil, nor endure the Remedy. ANNO, 1687. NEver had the Ottoman Empire, since the time, that they first passed out of Asia over into Europe, been under that E∣clipse and in that low of Ebb of Fortune as at present: And yet this following Year, was so much more unlucky and fatal to them than the former; as if their Mischiefs would not have ended, but with the total Ruin, and Downfal of their Empire: To prevent which, the Grand Seignior medita∣ted on Thoughts of Peace, and sent a Chiaus
(a thing which the Turks never practised before) to tender Articles to the Emperor, which were not received, nor other Answer given, than that his Imperial Majesty could not so much as enter into a Treaty without the consent of Venice and Poland, their Al∣lies. And thô the Turks endeavour'd to a∣vail themselves by that Method, yet they thought, that the best way to facilitate that proceeding, was with their Swords in their Hands, and by an appearance in the Field with the most formidable Army they were able to make;The Turks prepare for War. to which end all Otoracks, who are Milites immeriti, or Men excused from the War, on account of past Services with a dead pay, (as they call it) of which there may be Forty thousand in the Empire, were all summoned to appear in the next Campagne, and forced to the War with the greatest rigour, and on pain of Death, besides which new Levies were order'd to be made in all Parts of Asia; and particularly at Smyrna, and in the Parts adjacent; Six hun∣dred Soldiers were raised at the charge of the Citizens and Inhabitants; besides which eight or nine Millions being charged to be levied in the lesser Asia: The Quota taxed on Smyrna, came to a Hundred thousand Dollars, which Sum not being to be found amongst them, and perhaps scarce the Mo∣iety thereof, the Cappugi-bashee, who was sent to Collect the Money, carried away most of the principal Turks in that Town to Constantinople;Taxes ri∣gorously imposed. where having represented their Poverty, and inability to pay so great a Tax, it was moderated and brought down to one half, or to One hundred and five Purses: These proceedings may evi∣dently convince the World, that the con∣ceptions of the World generally formed of the vast Riches of the Grand Seignior's Treasury were imaginary, seeing, that it was so exhausted in a few Years, as to force the Government to those rigorous Courses, and unusual methods of Oppressi∣on, which can scare be repeated without a total Desolation, or extreme Misery of that Country. These Taxes joyned to the Discontents of the People, made all things uneasy at the Ottoman Court,Cabals at the Port. where it was impossible to prevent the Cabals, and liberty of Speech, which the Soldiers and others freely used in publick Discourse; to suppress which, and to restrain the Mutinies, which were daily expected; it was reported that the Grand Vizier designed to leave Belgrade, and March back to Constantinople: But the Grand Seignior consulting with his principal and wisest of his Confidents, laid his Com∣mands upon him not to remove from the Confines, but rather to keep a watch on the Motions of the Enemy, than to attend to domestick Seditions, which the Government was at all times able to appease;The Vi∣zier orde∣red to stay at Bel∣grade. and to quiet the mind of the Vizier, they gave him to understand, that he was entirely in the favour of his Prince, who was very sensi∣ble, that the misfortunes of the last year, were not to be attributed either to his ill Conduct, or want of Courage (as did ap∣pear by a Writing under the Hands of the principal Officers of the Army for his justi∣fication) but rather to the divine Justice of God, who was pleased for the Sins of the People to abate the Pride, and Glory of the Ottoman Empire. By this Letter the Grand Vizier being well satisfied of his Master's good Inclinations towards him, and strength∣ned in his hopes, that he should yet keep his Head for some time longer, or at least until the next misfortune, he alter'd his in∣tention of returning to the Port, and resol∣ved to pass his Winter at Belgrade, where his Presence was chiefly necessary for keeping the Army together, and more entire on the Frontiers: Moreover, during the rigour of this Winter season, he continued to fortify Belgrade, and gave Orders to erect a Fort on the Danube, for better security of Peter Waradin, and dispatched divers Convoys with Ammunition, and Provisions for the Succour and Relief of Great Waradin, Giu∣lia, Lippa, Zeno and Temeswar. In the mean time the Imperialists pressed Apafi Prince of Transilvania, to Declare him∣self entirely for the Emperour, and receive his Forces to Winter-quarters in his Coun∣try: But that Prince, who had been always very crafty and subtle in his Negotiations, did so possess the Emperour's Generals, with the danger which he himself should incur, and the disadvantage which would accrue to the Emperor thereby,A Treaty concluded with the Deputies of Transilva∣nia. whose benefit it would rather be for him to remain in a Neu∣trality, That Count Caraffa admitted the policy of his Plea to be good, and concluded a Treaty with the Deputies of Transilvania on certain Articles; as namely, That for subsistence of the Troops, which should be put into the Frontier places of their Coun∣try, Michael Apafi their Prince, should fur∣nish them every Month with Ten thousand Bushels of Wheat and Oats, for which one Moiety should be paid in ready Money, and that the other should be carried to, and laid up in the Magazines, or Store-houses at reasonable Rates, which was of more advantage to the Emperor, being there∣by disobliged from the trouble and charge of fetching and transporting such quantities of Provisions from Countries far distant from the places where they were to be used. And Secondly, it was agreed to give Winter Quarters to the Imperial Troops; upon which General Veterani Ordered and As∣signed
the several places, and Count Caraffa marched from Zatmar to Kalo, giving Dire∣ctions to General Heusler diligently to ob∣serve the motions of the Garrison at Wara∣dine, and rigorously to exact the Contribu∣tions of that Country for maintenance of the Troops. The Grand Vizier on the other side, who was a person of quick vivacity and readi∣ness of parts,The Vi∣zier pre∣pares for War, and sends to the Tartars. (as we have before declared) finding that the Proposals made to the Em∣peror for a Peace, were not likely to pre∣vail; he used all imaginable diligence which was possible to prosecute the War, living in hopes that the following year would prove more auspicious to the Ottoman Arms, than those lately past. In the first place, frequent Messages were sent to the Tartar Han, to hasten their speedy march, and begin the Campaign early, and with one Body to joyn with the Turkish Forces, and with ano∣ther to infest the Borders and Confines of Poland; and to make the diversion there greater and more violent, endeavours were used to raise divisions and jealousies be∣tween the Cosacks, who were Subjects to the Boles, and those to the Moscovites, sending rich Presents, and kind Salutes and Promi∣ses, to invite them to Desert and Revolt from their Princes, and take part with the Ottoman Forces. But this design miscarried, and took no Effect by the happy arrival of Two Ambassadors from the Czar's of Mos∣covy at the Court of Poland; where having occasion of their Union and Friendship,The Czar sends Am∣bassadors to Poland. no∣thing was omitted to gain their Alliance, thô their demands were so exorbitant, that nothing but a present necessity could have gained their concession. The Vizier being disappointed on that side, looked closely to his business in the lower Hungary; for having lost Quinque Ec∣clesiae, Siklos, Capiswar, and a great part of the Bridge of Esseck being burnt, the strong Fortress of Sigeth seemed to be in some danger,The Vi∣zier endea∣vours to relieve Si∣geth. and lie most exposed to the design of the Enemy: To prevent which, the Vizier caused the Tartars to advance and pass the River Drave, and so to join with the Turks in the City of Esseck; the Tartars, who are the most expert Soldiers in the World for destroying and laying waste a Country, having passed the Drave, left no∣thing for those who were to follow after them, carrying away all the Inhabitants with them; and with what Provisions they had plundered, they supplied the small Garrisons which remained to the Turks on the Banks of the Drave; and especial care above all was taken to furnish Sigeth with all sorts of Forage and Provisions, so that it was made the chief Magazine of all that Country; for better defence and security of which, several new Boats were built to re∣pair the Bridge before Esseck, and on the sides of the River divers small Forts were raised, on which Forty Pieces of Canon were Mounted, to prevent all Incursions of the Enemy, and Attacks on Sigeth; during which season of a rigorous Winter, the Tartars plaid their parts to hinder all Con∣voys laden with Forage and Provisions to supply the Fortresses, which the Christians had lately conquered. Howsoever by the diligence of Thinghen, Sergeant-General of Battalia, and the Governor of Quin{que} Ec∣clesiae, joyning themselves to the Regiment, commanded by Baron de Pace, they agreed to disappoint the aforesaid design of the Enemy: To which end having detatched Two hundred and Fifty select, or choice Foot, and Five hundred well-disciplined Horse and Dragoons, led by Brave and well Experienced Commanders, they sallied out of their Quarters about Sun-set, and the Horse for better Expedition mounting the Foot behind them, they made such haste, that before day in the Morning, they lodg∣ed themselves secretly near the Town of Sigeth;A surprize given to Sigeth. and without any noise conveying themselves into the Suburbs, about dawning of the day set them on Fire; which took with so much fury, that in a short time Three hundred Houses were all in a Flame; the which more increased the Consternation of the Inhabitants and Soldiery, because that many of those Houses were the Store-houses, in which were laid up vast quanti∣ties of Provisions. Many People surprized with the sudden and unexpected Fire, were smothered in the smoak, and perished in the flames; others at a distance betook them∣selves with great Confusion to their Arms,The Fear and Con∣sternation there. and not knowing as yet where the Enemy or the Danger was, Fired their Canon at random, they knew not where, nor on whom: The Day coming on, the light discovered the Enemy, and the Danger in which they were; howsoever in all this Action the Turks killed but Four Troopers, Three Dragoons, and a Corporal of Foot, and leaving their Houses in the Town, retired to the Castle, which gave the Imperialists an opportunity to set Fire to the City, and to burn some hundreds of Waggons all la∣den with Provisions, designed for the Camp, and Relief of Alba Regalis. With this suc∣cess the Christians retired, driving away with them some few heads of Cattle, a small quantity of Provisions, and such Plun∣der as could be taken, and carried away in so hasty an Action: To recover which the Turks made a fally and attacked them in the Arrear, to which, shame and confusion of face gave them Courage; but the Conque∣rors, whose Valour increased according to
their success, made a stand, and so assailed the Enemy, that notwithstanding all the consi∣derations of shame, and desire of revenge, they carried away their Spoils, and honour of the Victory. The happy consequence of this Action.The consequence of this success, (thô the Action in it self was not very great) was yet very considerable; for thereby the intercourse between Quinque Ecclesiae, Siklos, and other conquered Towns was rendered more free and secure, and not only the Pea∣sants of those Countries brought their Pro∣visions with readiness and safety to the Market; but even the Rascians, who were Inhabitants of the Town of Sigeth, came voluntarily in, and submitted themselves to the Protection of the Emperor. This Acti∣on served likewise to disappoint and over∣throw the design of the Commanders in Esseck, who intended an incursion of Turks and Tartars in Two separate Bodies; but their Provisions in Sigeth (on which they depended for maintenance of their For∣ces) being consumed, that resolution was put off till a fairer opportunity. Howso∣soever the Imperial Forces remained Vigi∣lant and Watchful on their Guard, having received frequent Alarums, that the Turks resolved on some sudden Enterprize to a∣venge themselves, and repair their Ho∣nour; which General Thinghen, and Colonel Pace greatly suspecting, retired to Quin{que} Ecclesiae, from whence they sent and distri∣buted considerable quantities of Corn and Flower to Kaposwar,The Chri∣stian Gar∣risons sup∣plied and relieved. and other places for sustenance of the Garrisons, giving special charge to the Governors thereof to be in∣tent and watchful to prevent any surprize of the Enemy: And for better security thereof, the Commissary General Count Ra∣bata farther supplyed all those places with Victuals, there being no want amongst them of Arms or Ammunition. Care likewise was taken to repair the Breaches at Quinque Ec∣clesiae, in as good a form and manner as the Season of the Year would permit: But because the Fortress of Siklos lay much ex∣posed to the attack of the Enemy, being the most Frontier Garrison, they raised with admirable industry and diligence a half Moon, which they encompassed with Pali∣sadoes, the Season of the Year nor time permitting to fortify it with a Wall, or any other Work. Whilst things were thus tran∣facted, and places secured on the Frontiers, no care or circumspection was omitted for conservation of Buda, tho' as yet the Walls and Breaches made in it the last Siege were not repaired, neither time nor season of the year,Buda cleansed of Rubbish. and perhaps other great employments, not giving time to so great a Work, which perhaps we may find neglected for some years afterwards; howsoever they laboured for the present to clear the Ditches, fill up the Trenches, level the Batteries, Breast-works, and other Redoubts; carrying away the Rubbish and Ruins of Houses and Buildings, which had been beaten down, and demolished by the vast quantities of Bombs and Carcasses which had been thrown into the Town during the last Siege: In which Work great quantities of Arms, which lay buried in the Ruins were discovered,Rich Goods found in Vauits. with Head-pieces, Corslets, and Semyters of value: And in digging the Cellars and Vaults, they found many Chests filled with rich Housholdstuff, with Trunks and Boxes of Writings and ancient Records, amongst which, as was Reported, were the Charter and Privileges given to that City, with a Regi∣ster of all passages which had happened there, since the time that it first submitted to the Dominion of the Turk. Nor were the Turks in the mean time idle and remiss on their part;The Pasha endeavours to secure Alba Re∣galis. for the Pasha of Alba Regalis suspecting that that City would be the next to be attacked, and made the Work and Design of the ensuing Cam∣paign; he studiously applyed the Soldiers and Workmen to raise new Outworks, and repair the old inward Fortifications, which by time, and the neglect of his Predecessors were much decayed; and to expedite and quicken this Work, the Soldiers, besides their ordinary Pay, were encouraged by dai∣ly Wages, such as was commonly given to Day-labourers. But to disturb this Work by frequent Alarums, a party of Hussars were detached to watch the Avenues about Alba Regulis, and sometimes to appear in sight of the Town, and intercept those who should go in or out from thence: Accordingly posting themselves in a private way, it was their fortune to meet and sur∣prize a party of Turks, of which they killed some, and took others, from whom they understood that they had been dispatched by the Pasha there, to carry Letters and Advi∣ces to the Grand Vizier at Belgrade: In like manner they encountered another party coming from Zigeth to Alba Regalis, to whom only they gave chase, the Turks sa∣ving themselves by the swiftness of their Horses. Howsoever by the Letters which were intercepted, they came to have a per∣fect knowledge of the state of that City, and the intentions of the Vizier; It was therein declared, That the Garrison consist∣ed of Four thousand Fighting men; but much discouraged, and in great fears and consternation,The State of Alba Regal. to think that they were to be made the next Sacrifice to the fury of the Christian Arms. Notwithstanding which, the Pasha encouraged the People of Alba Regalis assuring them that he had received late Letters from the Grand Vizier at Bel∣grade,
by which he promised them such a speedy relief both of Men, Provisions, Am∣munition, and Money, as might enable them to drive the Enemy from the Walls: And that he was sending a very strong Force to the Frontiers of Sclavonia, Croatia, and the River Dravus, under Command of seve∣ral Brave and well-experienced Pashas. The Season of the Year much favoured this design; for the Rivers, Marshes, and Fenns were so Frozen up, that the Turks found an easy passage to all parts, which they intended to relieve: Of which the Im∣perialists being very apprehensive, feared lest the Enemy, who was got together in great Numbers at Esseck, should attempt some of the conquered places, and thereby making a diversion, should introduce their Convoys into Sigeth, Canisia, and Alba Re∣galis. But the place, which of any other was straightned most for want of Provisions, was Agria, called by the Hungarians Erla, situate on a River of that Name, which about Three Leagues from thence empties it self into the Tibiscus. This place of it self was but small, but very well Fortified; It is Recorded in Histories that the first Siege which the Turks laid to it was in the Year 1552. with an Army of Sixty thou∣sand Men, when it was not strong either by Art or Nature; but the weakness thereof was supplied by the Courage and Bravery of the Garrison, consisting only of Two thousand Hungarian Soldiers, and about Sixty Hungarian Nobles and Gentlemen, who had fled in thither with their Wives and Children,Agria. and best of their Riches and Moveables, and had sworn to defend the place to the utmost extremity; and to let the Turks understand this resolution, they raised a Coffin above the Walls in publick View, for an Evidence or Sign, that they would chuse Death rather than Captivity. Many great things are said of the Defence of this place, which the Turks battered for the space of Forty days incessantly, with Fifty Pieces of Cannon, notwithstanding which the Defendants abated nothing of their Courage; for thô the Turks assaulted them Three times in one day, yet they were as often repulsed, and lost about Eight thousand men. The Women also signalized their Va∣lour above the Nature of their Sex in all these Actions; amongst which (as is report∣ed) there was one, who fought bravely in sight both of her Mother, and her Husband; but the latter being killed, the Mother ad∣vised her Daughter to carry away the Dead Corps; but she Answered, That she could not do it, until she had first revenged his Death; and thereupon taking up the Sword and Buckler of her dead Husband, she fell upon the Turks with such fury, that having killed Three of them with her own hand, she returned to perform the last Office to her deceased Husband. Several other par∣ticular Actions of this Nature, are recount∣ed of the Siege of this Fortress, which in fine relieved it self, and caused the Turks to raise their Siege, whom they pursued so vigorously in the Rear, that they killed great Numbers of them, and took most of their Baggage. And thus did this City continue in the hands of the Hungarians until the year 1596, when it was taken by Mahomet the Third, then in person be∣fore it, and hath ever since that time re∣mained in the hands of the Turks; who now hearing that that place was in great di∣stress for want of Provisions; and knowing the importance of it's Situation, endeavour∣ed to send it relief by all ways and means which were possible. The Pasha, who Quartered on the Fron∣tiers, was commanded by the Grand Vizier to put Succours into the place; and he also being a good Soldier, and sensible of the importance thereof, call'd a Council of War, to consider in what manner this Acti∣on might most effectually be performed; considering whereupon, it was moved,Proposals how Agria might be supplied. That since Tekeli had made several instances to be recruited with Men and Provisions for at∣tempting some great Exploit, That he should accordingly be reinforced with a moderate Number of Tartars, and some Turks, and that the care and incumbence of that great work should be committed to his Charge and Conduct. Count Caraffa, and General Heusler being advised of the Design, assembled a conside∣rable force of their Troops together,They are prevented. and assailed the Enemy near to great Waradin on a sudden, and in a manner of surprize; the Tartars, who are not much used to make a stand against well formed Troops, were the first who betook themselves to a speedy Flight, and were soon followed by Tekeli and his men; howsoever several were killed on the place, and some Prisoners taken: And so both Caraffa, and Heuster returned back to Debrezin, with the Forage and Spoil which they had gained in that Conflict. This misfortune did not much abate the Spirit of Tekeli; for having been lately sup∣plied with a Sum of Money, he made new Levies of Men, and many of his old Sol∣diers who had formerly deserted him, re∣turned to him again; so that he seemed to recover the Credit and Reputation which he had formerly lost; and having joyned his Forces to those of a Pasha on the Frontiers,Tekeli with Mo∣ney makes Levies. and to a rabble of Soldiers, who in a tumul∣tuary manner followed his Colours; he En∣camped sometimes near Temiswar, then about Giulia, and then near Waradin; from all
which places he sent Parties abroad to dis∣cover the posture of the Enemy, and to spy out how they might most securely succour Agria, for which the Grand Vizier was ex∣tremely pressing. Nor were the Christians less Vigilant to Observe and Watch the Mo∣tions of the Turks, and of Tekeli; whence it was that several Parties meeting each other, frequent Skirmishes happened, in all which the Hussars and Germans gained the advan∣tage: So that Tekeli finding the difficulty of carrying relief to Agria, and other places, made Incursions into the Countries subjected to the Emperor, marching with a Body of Turks, Tartars, and a Rabble of new raised Soldiers, which served rather for Guides than Combatants. In their way they burnt a Village of no great moment; and passed into the Confines of the Town of Segedin;Enters into the Coun∣try near Segedin. from whence being discovered by the Hussars of the Garrison, they took the Alarum; and being joyned to a Body of German Foot, they made a sally on the Enemy, and char∣ged them so furiously that Tekeli's new raised Soldiers, who were placed in the Front, imme∣diately gave back,Is Defeated and Wound∣ed. and pressed with fear, rush∣ed into the Body of the Turks, which put them into such disorder, that they were forced to Retreat with considerable loss: Tekeli him∣self being wounded with a Musquet-shot in the Knee, was forced for his Cure to betake himself to the Fortress of Temiswar. In the mean time his Princess being resolved to defend her Town of Mongatz, did not on∣ly fortify her self therein with a stout Garri∣son, and supplies of Ammunition and Pro∣visions; but sent several Parties of Horse from the Garrison, to destroy all the Coun∣tries round with Fire, and Sword, and thereby to cut off all possibility of sub∣sistence from the Imperialists; who having Advice thereof, detached a Party of Dra∣goons of the Regiment of Magni; who ha∣ving the fortune to Encounter the Enemy, gave them a total Defeat, killing Fifty of them on the place, of which their Com∣mander was one, and Six Prisoners were taken. Whilst matters passed thus in the Upper Hungary, the City of Agria suffered much for want of Provisions, which greatly discou∣raged both the Inhabitants and the Garrison,Forty men of Agria desert and joyn with the Chri∣stians. so that many deserted the place; and about Forty of them came to Onoth, declaring them∣selves to be Christians, and desirous to be received into the Church by Baptism. But the Imperial Commanders being doubtful of the sincere Faith of these new Converts, were not very forward to receive them into an Association; of which they being sensi∣ble, did voluntarily joyn themselves to a Party then going abroad upon a discovery, and so bravely behaved themselves in a Skirmish which they happened to have with the Turks, that they killed many of their Brethren with their own hands, and there∣by gave evident proofs of their real Con∣version. All this while no Garrisons were succour∣ed; for not only Agria was in miserable want,Grand Vi¦zier orders relief. but likewise all the Towns in the Lower Hungary, Sclavonia, and Croatia, suffered Scarcity and Famine. The Grand Vizier being in great care and pain for those places, sent strict Commands from Belgrade to the Commanders at Esseck, to supply all those places with necessary Provi∣sions; for Transportation of which the Da∣nube being frozen up, there was no other way left than to carry all by Waggons over the Snow, and Ice; for the Rivers, Lakes, Fenns, and Marshes being hard Frozen, were seldom strong enough to bear Car∣riages and Waggons, by the most direct and nearest way. And yet such had been the misery of the late Campagne, that the Countries were laid waste and desolate; all the Provisions and Forage being so destroyed, that to sustain the Famished Towns, and Countries, Supplies were to be fetched from far distant places: To perform which, the Commander of Esseck laboured with the ut∣most of his Endeavours, and dispeeded great Numbers of Waggons laden with all sorts of Ammunition and Provisions, to the wanting-places under a strong Convoy. The Imperialists having Advice hereof, made a Detatchment of Three hundred Musque∣teers,The Chri∣stians en∣deavour to prevent it. Three Troops of Curassiers belong∣ing to the Regiment of Newburg, and about Two thousand Four hundred Soldiers, which were Hussars, and Heyducks: The News of the Motion of these Forces soon Fled to Ca∣nisia, Sigeth, and other places; where being in some fear for the safety of their Convoy, those of Sigeth sent out a strong Party, pla∣cing them in Ambush about Two English Miles distant from the Town. The Con∣voy proceeded with what haste they could, and the Baron d Orlich pursued them as fast, and overtook them near the place where the Ambush was planted, and charged them so furiously, that he totally Defeated them, Killed One hundred and Twenty on the place, dispersed the rest, and made himself Master of all the Carriages. In the mean time Tekeli was neither idle or negligent in his Arms or Plots; for he had employed his Engines in divers parts to sollicit the Citizens and Inhabitants of Bart∣feld, Esperies, and Cassovia to a Revolt;Plots con∣trived by Tekeli are discovered and having droven out the Garrisons, he promised to supply them with a more nume∣rous Force: These Offers, and the Ways and Methods being happily discovered, se∣veral were accused for Complices in the
Plot; amongst which a certain Judge whom Tekeli had formerly employed at Cassovia, was seized and imprisoned: Likewise seve∣ral Gentlemen and Magistrates of those places were known to have entertained Cor∣respondencies with those of Mongatz and Agria; and that Tekeli had remitted consi∣derable Sums of Money to them for execu∣tion of their design. The Judge being put to the Question on the Wrack, accused Two and twenty to have been engaged with him in the Plot. And another Conspiracy against the Life of Count Caraffa was likewise dis∣covered, in which above Seventy persons, and some of Quality, were engaged. One Radwanski, a principal Author of the late Commotions was put to the Torture; and after he had Signed a Confession, dyed by the Anguish of the Wrack; howsoever the Sentence pronounced against him,Offenders are pu∣nished. was ex∣ecuted on his Dead Corps, which was to have his Hand and Head cut off, and his Four Quarters disposed in divers places of the City. In like manner Palassi, Sekel, Barrock, and Concoud, were Beheaded and Quartered: As also the same day one Besseck, a Counsellor of Newsol, and Weber, a pub∣lick Notary, Tascias, and several incurred the same fate; and so had also Feldmeyer, a Commissary at War, but that he Killed him∣self in Prison; howsoever that did not hin∣der, but that the Sentence was Executed on his Dead Body. To examine this Plot, and sift into the bottom of it, so employed Count Caraffa, as for some time it deferred the design of Bombing Agria; and indeed so many were the Conspirators, that great Executions were acted in divers places, and many also received pardon from the Mercy and Clemency of the Emperor; for that his Imperial Majesty had been well assured, there were considerable Numbers of poor inno∣cent People engaged in the Plot rather by de∣lusion, and example of others, than by a Natural Spirit and inclination to a Revolt. Thô Caraffa was otherwise employed, yet there wanted not other active Officers in the Field to watch the Motions of the Enemy, and take the Advantages which did present. Baron Orlick was commanded to burn the Bridge, which the Turks had built over the Drave near Esseck; and accordingly marched away from Quin{que} Ecclesiae,Baron Or∣lick de∣feats a Party of the Turks. with Six Companies drawn out from the Regi∣ments of Montecuculi, and Herberville; and being on his march, he received Advice that Eight hundred Janisaries, and Two hundred Spahees selected out of the Flour of the best Ottoman Troops, were detached from Esseck, with a design to intercept a Convoy appointed for the relief of Ziclos, and to take and demolish a small Redoubt which had some days before been raised on the Banks of that River, by order of Count Vechi: Wherefore leaving the design of burning the Bridge, Baron Orlick marched directly against the Enemy, whom he found attacking the Fort, in which they had alrea∣dy killed a great many men with Grana∣does: But so soon as Orlick appeared, the Turks fell into disorder and fear; and being furiously charged by him, were defeated with the loss of above Six hundred men killed on the place, amongst which were two Aga's, and a Bey or Lord; Many Pri∣soners were taken with all their Baggage, and many Ensigns and Colours, of which Five were sent to the Emperor by Baron de Hertleben, first Captain of that Regiment:The Turks worsted in several Skirmishes. And on the Emperor's side, Six Sergeants, Five Troopers, and Twelve Dragoons were killed, and many wounded. About the same time another Party of Turks was beaten near Zolnoch, Twenty of which were killed,Chonad defends it self against the Turks. and about Thirty taken Prisoners. Moreover Seven thousand Turks, Tartars, and Male-contents being joyned together, endeavour∣ed to surprize Chonad, which is a Fortress situate on the River Maros, which falls into the Tibiscus, near to Segedin: But they met so vigorous a repulse and rude entertain∣ment from the Defendants, that they were forced to desist from their Attacks, and march away with the loss of Four hundred Soldiers, some of which were principal Of∣ficers. Thus the News of one ill success com∣ing to Constantinople on the Head of another struck the People of all sorts and condi∣tions with a strange Consternation;The Otto∣man Port in great disorder. the Government fearing the ill consequences thereof, endeavoured by all ways and me∣thods of gentleness to appease the unquiet and fluctuating Spirits of the People and Soldiers. To do this, there was a necessity of vast Sums of Money, wherewith to quiet and gratify the Army and Fleet, and to sa∣tisfy the Tartars, who declared that it was impossible for them to move without Mo∣ney; and which way to raise it, was the great difficulty; for the Grand Signior's Treasure was exhausted, and the People al∣ready tired, and over-burdened with Taxes: Wherefore after a long Debate thereupon in the Divan, it was agreed, That the Jewels and Plate of the Sultans amassed in several Chambers of the Seraglio should be put to sale, which might have raised vast Sums of Mo∣ney,Great want of Money. could they have been sold to their va∣lue; but there was an impossibility of find∣ing Buyers; for thô the Money could have been found in Constantinople, yet there was none, who durst own to be Master of so so great Riches. In fine, after divers De∣bates and Expedients proposed, it was agreed to raise Money, by way of Contri∣bution,
on the chief and prime Officers of the Seraglio, and of the Empire, and parti∣cularly on Kadees, and Men of the Law and Church,Means to raise it. on Customers, Tax-gatherers, and rich Merchants, such as lived easily and idly in their Houses; it seeming reasonable that such who enjoyed Protection and Safeguard in their peaceable Acquisitions at home, should maintain and provide them who were venturing their Lives, and fighting in their defence abroad. And whereas the Tartar Han was very pressing and importunate for Money, without which he could not move or serve in this Year's Campagne; it was resolved to send him Fifty thousand Crowns in Money, and to make up the rest of his Demands in Diamonds, Scymeters studded with Rubies, Emralds, and Pearls; and with Bucklers set with precious Stones, and other things of value taken from the Trea∣sury in the Seraglio. But whilst this was contriving, an un∣happy Sedition and Mutiny arose amongst the Levents, who are Soldiers belonging to the Sea;A Mutiny among the Marine Soldiers. who having wanted Pay for a long time, came in a tumultuous manner to the Captain Pasha, who is Admiral of the Fleet, to demand it; and rushed with such violence into his House, that he had scarce time to escape out of their hands; and had proceeded to greater extremities, had they not been appeased with a speedy tender of Six Months Pay. When these things were quieted, a strict Examination was made in∣to the Cause and Leaders of this Mutiny, of which some were strangled, and about Twenty others were put into a Sack, after their Custom, and cast into the Sea: How∣soever this Severity did not so suppress this Rabble, but that many of them assembled to∣gether in the City, where they plundered divers Houses, and committed a Thousand Outrages, until such time as Proclamation was made, giving Licence to the People to do themselves Justice, and kill those who made any attempt on their Houses or Goods; which was the best way to deal with a Li∣centious Tumult; for so soon as such a De∣cree was known, the lewd Mobile grew afraid, and dispersed, most of them with∣drawing themselves Aboard their Vessels. But not only did the Ottoman Govern∣ment labour under a want of Money, but of Men also.Want of men. For whereas they expected a Recruit of Forty thousand men out of Asia for this Campagne, notwithstanding the most rigorus Commands sent, to compel all men to the War, there appeared not Six thousand: For Turcomania had not furnish∣ed above Two thousand men; Syria and Palestine One thousand Eight hundred, and the Asia Minor Two thousand: The new Levies in and about Constantinople did not amount to above Three thousand Five hun∣dred; and all that could at present be found, wherewith to Recruit the Armies both in Hungary, and in the Morea, did not amount unto more than Twenty thousand men; ma∣ny of which deserted in their march, and fled into the Mountains, where they ab∣sconded, and passed the most part of the Summer, being forced to commit many Outrages for their necessary subsistence. These Misfortunes and disappointments moved the Grand Signior and his Coun∣sellors, to judge a Peace with the Emperor,The Turks seek for Peace. the most compencious Method to secure the State of the Ottoman. Empire, which was now staggering, and falling with its own weight;  and therefore gave orders to the Vizier, then at Belgrade, to endeavour a Peace at any price, and rate whasoever. Accordingly the Grand Vizier dispatched a Letter from Belgrade dated the 6th of March, to Prince Herman of Baden, President of the Council of War to the Emperor, giving him to understand, That the Sultan, his Lord and Master being persuaded to put an end to this miserable War, which had long been maintained at the Expence of much Blood, and Treasure on both sides. He thought it necessary in order thereunto to Appoint a Place, and Nominate Commission∣ers for a Treaty: And to Evidence the reality and sincere intentions of the Sultan towards a Peace; an Offer was made, as the first Preliminary to deliver up Tekeli into the hands of the Emperor. These Proposals were brought by an Aga as far as Debrezin, from whence he demanded a safe Conduct to proceed as far as Esperies. But to cut this Treaty short, the Emperor commanded Count Caraffa to let the Grand Vizier know, that he would be ready to make peace with the Ottoman Port, upon a Grant or Con∣cession of Three Articles only. First,The Empe∣ror de∣mands three Articles. That the Grand Seignior should pay to him Six Mil∣lions of Gold in satisfaction of the Ruin and Spoils, which his Troops had commit∣ted in Austria, and other his Hereditary Provinces. 2dly, That all the Towns and Places, which the Turks possessed in Hungary should be delivered up to the Emperor, and the Turkish Forces withdrawn from that Kingdom. 3dly, That in all other matters they should give equal satisfaction to the Allies. But as to Tekeli, he being a Subject and a Rebel, the surrender of him into the hands of Justice, seemed not a Motive suf∣ficient, nor any prevailing Argument, where∣on to ground the Foundation of a Peace. These Propositions being sent to Constantino∣ple, were considered as no other than as an absolute refusal to Treat or Hearken to a Peace; which caused great Fear and Con∣sternation at the Port; and which was greatly
Augmented by the News, which came much about the same time with the former: That the Moscovite Ambassadors, who had con∣cluded the Peace already at Leopolis between the Czars and the King of Poland, were ar∣rived at Vienna,  and had there also entred into the same League with the Emperor a∣gainst the Turks. These Ambassdors arrived at Vienna on the 18th of March, and on the 24th were con∣ducted to their Audience with these follow∣ing Ceremonies and Solemnity. In the First place, some Companies of the City Trained-Bands, and Garrison of Vienna marched before, and were followed by For∣ty Moscovites clothed in Velvet, and Silk Habits of divers Colours; they were armed with Scymeters adorned and beset with Diamonds, and other precious Stones, but without Bows, or Quivers which they wore on the Day when they made their Entrance; they were stately Mounted on fine Horses, with Saddles and Housses Embroidered with Gold and Pearl, every one having a Foot-man waiting on him at the side of his Horse: These were followed by Sixteen Coaches, with Six Horses a-piece, belonging to the Chief Officers of the Court to carry the Train, and Attendants of the Ambassadors, with Two Russian Priests habited after the manner of their Order: After these Coach∣es marched Sixty Citizens all Clothed in Black Velvet, who carried the Presents, which the Czars had sent to his Imperial Majesty, which consisted chiefly of Sables, and other rich Furrs, the Teeth of Fish, rich Quivers Embroidered with Gold and Silver, Pearls, and precious Stones, with Bows and Arrows suitable thereunto. Af∣ter all these came a Moscovite alone, Moun∣ted on a brave Horse, carrying the Czars Letter to the Emperor on his Head; and was followed by Two Coaches with Six Horses belonging to the Person of the Em∣peror, in one of which was the Great Chancellor of Moscovy, with another of the Ambassadors; and in the second was he that was chief in the Commission of the Embassy, accompanied by Noblemen ap∣pointed by the Emperor to receive them; and in this Order were conducted to the Palace-Yard, where Three Companies were drawn up with their Arms presented: The First which alighted at the Gate of the Pa∣lace, were the Moscovites which rode on Horseback: Then the Secretary with the Letter, and the Ambassadors being descended into the inward Court, they were met at the foot of the Stairs by the Prince of Swartzemberg, and by the P. of Dietrichstein, High-Steward of the Emperor's Houshold in the Knight's Hall; who conducted them into the Lobby before the Chamber of Au∣dience, where leaving their Scymeters, and other Arms in the Charge and Keeping of the First Gentleman of the Bed-Chamber, they were admitted to the Presence of the Emperor, of whom they received a favourable Audience. After which they were conducted back again in the same order, having first been sumptuously treated at a Dinner in the Imperial Court. In short, after divers Conferences, an Alliance and League was concluded with them, on the same Foot and Articles, as had been the last Year a∣greed between the Czars, and King of Po∣land;April. 1687. and soon the 5th of April the Four Ambassadors received their Audience of Congé,April. 1687. and soon afterwards Three of them returned to their own Country: And one pro∣ceeded to Venice, where he was received with those Formalities which that Senate always uses towards Ambassadors of that Quality. The Grand Vizier being well assu∣red by all these Proceedings, that there was no further place of hope left for obtaining Peace, commanded the Inhabitants of all places in subjection to the Grand Seignior, to drive their Cattel under the Reach and Protection of those Towns, which were de∣fended with Cannon; and to carry their Grain, and Forage, and Moveables into Fortified places, under Obedience of the Grand Seignior. They finished their Bridge of Boats at Peter Waradin, and with all the diligence imaginable they laboured to repair the Bridge of Esseck; which they having Finished with admirable Expedition, cau∣sed several of their Troops to pass the same, and make their Excursions to the very Gates of Quinque Ecclesioe, which giving some jea∣lousy, that the Turks intended to Besiege that Place, Three hundred Hussars, and Two hundred Heiducks were sent therein to reinforce the Garrison. At the same time the Count de Tinghen was ordered with a Detachment of Eight hundred Germans, and Four hundred Hei∣ducks, with One hundred Horse belonging to Siklos, and some other Troops to take a View of the Passage over the Drave: And having passed that River on the 8th of June, where joyning with some Troops under the Command of Baron Orlick, he drove away from the Pastures near Walpo, Two hundred Head of Cattel, and One hundred Horse, and set Fire to about One hundred small Cottages, which had been raised since the late Desolation; and being in their Re∣treat Encountred by a Party of One hun∣dred Spahees, and Three hundred Janisaries, they totally defeated them, Killing about Seventy on the place, and taking several Prisoners, with the loss only of a Lieute∣nant, and of Eight or Ten Common Sol∣diers Wounded. About the same time a
De∣tachment from the Garrison of Zolnock, con∣sisting of Four hundred Hussars, met another strong Party of Turks belonging to Agria, which they charged with such Bravery, that after a very sharp Conflict, the Turks were forced to retire with the loss almost of Two hundred men; Seven and thirty Prisoners were taken, with many Horses, and a con∣siderable part of their Baggage: Amongst which they found a Letter from the Pasha of Agria to the Vizier, setting forth the mi∣serable scarcity of all Provisions in that place, as also of Ammunition; and that the Famine was so great that they were forced to Eat Horse-Flesh, and Dogs; by reason of which many of the Garrison had deserted, and unless speedily relieved, they should be forced to surrender the Town. At length the Pasha of Agria being droven to desperate necessities,Agria in distress. sent to a Village be∣tween Buda and Agria, forthwith to bring them Provisions upon pain of Military Ex∣ecution; of which Baron Beck being adver∣tised by the Inhabitants, immediately detached a Party of Five hundred men, to Attend and Watch this Motion of the Turks; in which Adventure, he had the Fortune to meet with them, killing many, and taking some Pri∣soners, and pursuing the rest to the Walls of Agria. This was the beginning of the Campaigne, and a Prelude to the happy Successes of the Ensuing Year; when News came that the Grand Vizier was marching at the Head of a Numerous Army towards Waradin, the Number of which was Reported to amount unto. Fifty thousand men, according to the account which some Spyes pretended to have received from the Muster-Roll,  taken the 27th of April, in the Plains of Salankemen near Belgrade; as followeth: The Grand Vizier, Janisaries 7000 Pasha of Bosna, Spahees 4000 Pasha of G. Waradin, Spahees 1000 Beglerbey of Romelia, Janisaries 2400 Pasha of Soria, Spahees 4000 Beglerby of Sebassia, Spahees 2500 Pasha of Aleppo, Janisaries 3000 Pasha of Damascus, Janisaries 4000 Pasha of Nicopolis, Janisaries 11400 Pasha of Karahitar, Volontiers 8000 Aga of the Artillery Granadiers. 1100   48400 To this 600 Miners are to be added; 1400 Camels of Burden, 364 Oxen to draw the Artillery, 400 Waggons with Ammunition, 45 heavy Pieces of Cannon, 28 Lighter for the Field. All which belonged to the Army of the Grand Vizier, not accounting the Tartars, nor the Hungarian Army under Tekeli; nor Garrisons and Parties dispersed in divers parts. On the other side, on the 4th of June, the Duke of Loraine arrived at Buda, where he was received with Three Salvoes of all the Cannon from the Town;  and having taken an account of the Horses, and sur∣veyed the Fortifications, and given Com∣mand for raising New Works, to which Employment Four thousand Soldiers and Peasants were appointed; he departed thence on the 7th, taking his march towards the Drave with a part of his Army; he designed to Encamp near the Bridge of Esseck, where Count Cherffemberg was to joyn him with Nine Regiments; And let us here take a Computation in like manner of the Imperi∣al Army, as we have done of the Turks. Of Dragoons there were Nine Regiments. Of Lodron Stirum Castelli Serau Herbeville Savoy Thun Magni Kussel. The first of which Dragoons consisted of Eleven hundred men, all the others of Eight hundred each, making in all Seven thousand Five hundred men. The Cavalry consisted of Nineteen Regi∣ments. Of Saxelauemburg Caprara Dunewald Palfi Caraffa Gondola Taff Newbourg Montecuculi Veterani Piccolomini Heusler Commercy Gotz Hannover Saint Croix Furstemberg Pax Truchs These Regiments amounting unto Eight hundred men each, compleated the Number of Fifteen thousand Two hun∣dred men. To these we are to add Seven
and twenty Regiments of Infantry, of which Five and twenty consisted of One thousand Five hundred men each, and Keiserstein's, and Stadel's Regiments of Two thousand men each,The num∣ber of the Christian Army. so that the whole Number of the Infantry amounted in all unto Forty one thousand Five hundred men; so the whole Army, according to this Computation, a∣mounted to Sixty four thousand Two hun∣dred men, besides Pioniers, Gunners, and Attendants on the Camp. The Names of the Regiments of the In∣fantry were as followeth: Of Count Ernest of Staremberg Lesley Keyserstein Baden De Croy. Mansfield Salms Maximilian de Staremberg Serini Neubourg Souches Scherstemberg Stadel Diepenthal Count Guey de Staremberg Tinhen Meternich Beck Wallis Aspremont Nigrelli Heusler Aversperg The Young Prince of Loraine Hourchin Furstemberg Strasler This being the State of the Christian Ar∣my, consisting of Sixty four thousand Men plentifully supplied with all sorts of Ammu∣nition, and much superior to that of the Turks in Numbers, and much more for Dis∣cipline by Instruction of the Commanders, and Bravery of the Soldiers; The Duke of Loraine on the Twelfth of June proceeded on his march to the River of Sarawitz, and in his way received Intelligence, that Agria was in such extreme want of Provisions, and that the Famine there was so great, that un∣less the Grand Vizier did by force of Arms succour the City with Victuals,June 1687. and Ammu∣nition, the Place would be constrained to surrender it self into the hands of the Ene∣my; to prevent which, and to relieve the Town, the Vizier appointed a Body of Eight thousand Turks, and Four thousand Tartars immediately to pass the Bridge at Peter-Waradin to Convoy the Waggons and Camels laden with Provisions, and force their way into Agria. Upon this Advice the Duke of Loraine dispatched an Express to Count Caraffa, with Orders to draw out the Twelve Regiments Encamped between Onoc, and Zolnock, and therewith to inter∣rupt and stop the passage of the Enemy; but such was the diligence of the Turks, that marching by secret Ways, they missed of Caraffa; and fell in with a weaker Body of Col. Heusler;Succour brought to Agria. who having killed about Sixty Turks, forced one part of them to re∣tire back to Peter-Waradin, whilst others more bold and forward than the rest, each man carrying a Sack of Meal behind him on his Horse, got into Agria, which was sufficient to afford them a subsistence for a short time. In the mean time the Forces began to gather near Barchan, which was the place appointed for the General Rendezvous: Thither came also the Troops of Zolnoc, which were to be commanded by the Elector of Bavaria, who very seasonably arrived at the Camp to the great joy and encourage∣ment of the whole Army: With him also came Prince Lewis of Baden, a Person of admirable Prudence and Courage; and of such experience and fortunate success, that the Elector reposed great confidence in his Conduct.The Elector of Bavaria comes to the Camp. The Army being put into a fit posture and condition to march, intelligence was brought that the Duke of Loraine was far advanced on his way towards Oseck; up∣on which no time was admitted to follow him; but the way being long, and the Ways deep and broken by the late Rains, the Ar∣my moved slowly, and could not unite so speedily with the Duke of Loraine as was expected: But at length with Industry, Time, and Patience, the Armies joyned, when News came that the Enemy in great Num∣bers were assembled near Peter-Waradin, and had formed a Bridge over the Tibiscus, to equal the convenience of which, with that of the Enemy, and maintain a Correspon∣dence with Forces on the other side, the Duke of Loraine caused another to be built near Tolna, and Foituar, the better to facilitate a Conjunction with the Imperial Arms. It was now made known,Esseck to be first attacked. that the Cam∣paign was to begin with the attack of the Town of Esseck, that from thence a way might be opened to the Conquest of Bel∣grade; in order unto which, General Dune∣walt, with some German Regiments, and Troops belonging to Croatia, and the adja∣cent Countries, was commanded to march towards Verovitza, and there to expect
farther Orders from the Duke of Loraine. The Troops of Croatia, Commanded by Count Philip de la Torre in the place of Du∣nebolt, (who was Sick at Vienna) marched in a strong Body with very good order, and a large Train of Artillery, provided by the Chamber of Stiria, and happily joyned with Dunewalt. The Duke of Loraine ha∣ving left a strong Party to defend the Bridge, which he had made over the Danube, mo∣ved his Camp from Mohatz, and without a∣ny opposition in the least,June 1687. pitched again near to Darda on the 24th of June, which is a Fortress that covers one end of the Bridge at Oseck. The next day the Imperialists discover'd from their Camp a certain number of Turks, who had lodged themselves in the Marsh, which began to be dry, that they might take a survey of the, Christian Camp; against which a small Party being sent, they immediately retired to give advice unto the Town of Oseck, of the near approach of the Enemy: Against this Party of Turks many more than those appointed, were out of Curiosity carried to the Skirmish,The Grand Vizier de∣sired to succour Esseck. to see who those were who called so frankly to them in the French Language. The News being brought to Oseck, or Esseck, Expresses were dispatched one after the other to the Vizier, (who was then Encamped with the Ottoman Army near to Peter-Waradin) ear∣nestly desiring him to march immediately to their Succour. In the mean time the Duke of Loraine having disposed his Army in an exact mili∣tary posture, he went himself in person with a Body of about Six hundred Horse to take a view of the Neighbouring Passes; and next Morning being the 25th of June,June. he Decamped with the whole Army, and com∣manded the Count of Schertemberg, Major-General of the Infantry, to see whether the Bridges were repaired; and having ad∣vanced at a good distance before, without any discovery; it was resolved to march with the whole Army as far as Uttona, where Orders had been given to provide all Mate∣rials for making a Bridge to pass the Drave. But before this Design was put in Executi∣on,The Impe∣rialists possess themselves of Bridges, and a Fort built by the Turks. Souches received Orders, with a Party of One thousand Three hundred Musque∣tiers, together with Count Guido de Starem∣berg, to march along the Banks of the Drave, upon a discovery which was so lucky, that he soon perceived certain little Bridges, railed on each side, strong, and covered with Earth very artificially made; not far from which, there was a Fort with some Guns, and a Garrison of about Four hun∣dred Soldiers, that were Janisaries. As the Imperialists approached, the Turks received them with such a Volley of shot, as at first put them into some disorder; but being a∣nimated by the Bravery of Souches and Sta∣remberg, they immediately invested the Fort with such courage, as forced the Turks to abandon the place with the loss of Two hundred men, and the remainder to fly to Esseck, to the Walls of which the Imperia∣lists so nearly pursued them, that they had almost entred with them into the Gates; howsoever they took possession of the Fort, and burnt that part of the long Bridge, for about the space of Five hundred Paces in length, which the Turks had lately repaired with Rayls, and covered with Earth. The Garrison of Esseck being in great fear at the so near approach of the Christian Army, dispatched Messenger after Messen∣ger, to advise the Vizier of their danger,The Vzier Order, his Army o march. and that they were endeavouring to pass the Drave with Bridges; upon which Intelligence the Vizier caused the greatest part of his For∣ces to march, remaining himself behind, in ex∣pectation of the Asiatick Troops, who moved with less diligence, than the present pressure of Affairs did require. Thô the Duke of Loraine was not igno∣rant that the greatest part of the Turkish Army lay Encamped near Esseck; yet be∣ing very desirous to Engage the Enemy, notwithstanding their Entrenchments, he endeavoured to pass the River at Uttona, being a small Redoubt, or Fortress, which P. Lewis of Baden had raised the year before, being a very convenient Pass for the Forces; for that falling down from thence with the Stream, they might conveniently be Landed at Valpo, about Four Leagues distant from Oseck. To this End the Infantry was com∣manded to advance towards Siclos, with the Cavalry of Montecuculi, Ladron, and Hano∣ver; the rest of the Army was commanded to keep their Station near Darda. In the mean time whilst the Bridges were preparing, such great Floods of Snow-waters fell from the Mountains of Stiria, and Carinthia,Floods break the Bridges. that the Drave swelled beyond its Banks with a most rapid Stream, and the Marshes or Morasses were filled in such manner, that it was very difficult to lay the Bridges, or raise Ways over the Marshes, which were afterwards made firm and passable, by vast quantities of Brush and Faggots,The Mar∣shs repair∣ed. which the Soldiers had cut and laid: And that no time might be lost, whilst the Waters were aba∣ting, Orders were dispatched unto General Dunewalt, who was in Croatia with several Thousands of the Inhabitants of that Coun∣try, to secure the passage of those Boats, which were appointed to carry Provisions and Ammunition to the Army from Stiria. Dunewalt having observed these Orders, the Duke of Loraine Detached a small Party to view and discover the face and
posture of the Enemy; and to espy and take an account of what Troops lay in the way to oppose their Passage. This Party being returned with intelligence that the Way was clear and open; the Impe∣rialists without any opposition posted them∣selves on a high Ground near Walpo, over-against Uttona; where the Duke of Loraine in Person passed the River, to lay out the Ground, and open the Trenches for better Security to the Army in their Passage. Siaus Pasha at Esseck.In the mean time the Heyducks had the Fortune to take Six Turks near to Esseck, who declared upon Oath that the Grand Vizier was still at Peter-Waradin, and that Siaus, Pasha of Aleppo was come into Esseck with Two thousand men, where they had raised a Trench of about Two thousand Paces in length. Howsoever the Duke resolving to pass the Drave, Ferried over in Boats a consi∣derable Number of Dragoons, and German Foot, to labour in digging the Trenches, which were intended to secure the Passage of the whole Army, which was a most im∣mense Labour, and such (as we may say) had not been performed in many preceeding Ages, for that Thirty thousand Faggots were not sufficient for settling the Marshes, which by reason of the abundant Rains were scarce passable;A labo∣rious Work. besides the raising of Five and twenty Bridges in divers places, all which was performed with unexpressible industry in the space of Four days; the Duke of Loraine himself in person encou∣raging and lending a helpful hand unto the Work: Howsoever this Work was not done without some loss and damage in the Transportation of the Horse, Baggage, and Cannon. Some part of the Imperial Infantry ha∣ving passed the Drave in Boats, and follow∣ed by the Croats of Dunewalt's Regiment; the Duke of Loraine, in the next place, caused all the remaining Infantry to pass as fast, and in as full Bodies, as the Bridges would allow; so that they might be able to make a resistance against any Force, which they expected might be sent from Esseck to interrupt their Passage; but the Turks mo∣ved not, but remained still in their Trenches, all the time that the Army, Cannon, and Baggage were with Boats and Bridges Tran∣sporting from one side of the River unto the other: Before which was finished, they were forced to withdraw their main Bridge,Trees cut and thrown into the Stream by the Turks. by reason of the fall of great Trees, which the Turks above about the parts of Kanisia had purposely Cut down, and Launched out into the Torrent; that be∣ing carried down with a mighty Rapid Stream, increased by an abundance of Rains, served very much to break and over∣throw their Bridges: Howsoever in a short time the Bridge was repaired, and then the Thirteen Regiments of Horse, which were left to cover the Bridge, passed over to the rest of the Army. The Imperial Forces under the Duke of Loraine being thus passed, General Caprara with his Horse was commanded to do the like at Uttona, which was performed the 12th of July;July. and also the Elector of Ba∣varia passed his Forces on the 13th, toge∣ther with Nineteen Imperial Regiments near Siklos. Thus the whole Army being joyned on the other side of the Drave, on the 15th the Generals Dined together,The Army passed the Drave. and in the Af∣ternoon made a short march towards Walpo, where the day following they Encamped near to the Castle, which was defended by a good Garrison. The same day General Heusler joyned the Army, as did also Count Bargozzi with Two thousand Hungarians. The 17th very early in the Morning, the Quarter-Master-General was commanded to advance, as were also those who had the care of the Forage committed to them; and Heusler with a Party of Four hundred Croats was ordered to seek out,Marches forward. and take a view of the Enemies Camp; in his way unto which, he fell in with some Thousands of them, which he charged so bravely, that he obliged them to Retreat, and pursued them to a narrow Pass, where he thought fit to stop, fearing some Ambuscade, or private de∣sign to ensnare him: And having posted his Soldiers in good order, he intended to repose a while, and take a little Breath; and having called for a Glass of Wine,Heusler wounded. whilst he was drinking a Musquet-shot fired from a Neighbouring Wood, passed his Left-Leg from one side to the other; and having gra∣ted a little on the Boan, it was thought that it might require some time to Cure; so he reposed that Night near Carazizza,July. by which ran a small Stream, sending his Spyes abroad to prevent surprizal. On the 18th the whole Army marched, and pitched that Night about Two English Miles distant from Esseck, where some Par∣ties of the Turks being abroad, retired to their main Camp. The next Morning by Break of Day, the Duke of Loraine com∣manded the whole Army to advance in or∣der of Battel: And because the Ways were narrow, the Woods and Bushes thick, Com∣mands were given to the Pioniers, and La∣bourers to cut down the Trees,The Army marches in Battalia. and Un∣der-Woods, and so to open the Ways, that the Army might march in Two Lines; which was done with such expedition and in∣dustry, that the Troops marched in that ad∣mirable order, as evidenced the Conduct of one of the greatest Captains in the World; and in this manner they appeared in sight of the Enemy.
The Grand Vizier with a Numerous Ar∣my, and a well-ordered Camp, lodged un∣der Esseck, fortified with a deep and regular Trench, and guarded with a good number of Cannon, in an open Plain, about a Musquet-shot from a Wood.The Vi∣ziers strongly encamped. The Christians were much surprized to find the Turks thus regularly Encamped, which was an Art un∣known to them till now; being therein in∣structed by some French Engeniers, and Captains, with Soldiers of the same Nati∣on, under the Command of the Marquess of Persan,Are assisted by the French. a person well esteemed by the Grand Seignior, and in favour with the Vi∣zier: For now it was, that the French Na∣tion began not only to enter into an interest and confidence with the Turks, by the assi∣stance they gave them of Officers and Enginiers; but farther obliged the whole City of Constantinople, with Provisions of Rice and Wheat brought from Alexan∣dria on 14 Sail of French Ships, when the City was labouring under great want, and Famine almost of all necessaries for Life. The Christian Army being now come in sight of the Turkish Camp; it was expe∣cted that the Grand Vizier would have marched out, and given them Battle, which the Christian Generals bravely offer'd,The Turks keep with∣in their Camp. and the Soldiers desired with a Courage answer∣able to their former Successes: But the Turks finding it their advantage to remain within their Trenches, made use of their Cannon against the Imperial Camp; which lying o∣pen, and undefended without Works or Trenches, did great execution both against the Horse and Men; and amongst other Officers Count Francis Palfy, who was Lieu∣tenant Colonel of the Regiment, which be∣longed to the General of that name, was shot in the Head by a Cannon Bullet. Du∣ring the time that the Armies lay in this posture several Skirmishes hapned with vari∣ous Successes; and particularly one proved not very fortunate to a party of Croats, who being on Foot, and ill armed, were un∣skilfully engaged, and too far advanced by the rashness of their Commanders;Some Cro∣ats cut off. and they firing all their Musquets at one volly, were left open to the Enemy; and not being seconded by other Troops, above one half of them were killed upon the place, the rest retiring to the main Body. In this man∣ner did the Turks make frequent Sallies on the Christian Camp, endeavouring to draw them into Ambuscades, but not to an equal and fair Battle, which the Vizier was not willing to adventure, but rather to watch advantages within his Camp,The man∣ner of the Turkish Camp. which was strongly fortified with Trenches, Pali∣sadoes and Cannon, having a Line drawn from the River Drave to a Wood, which with a Morass, and the River Valkowar to the left, Flanked with the Town of Oseck, and covered behind with the Castle Valko∣var, and the Danube, by which all Provi∣sons were carried in great abundance; which render'd the Camp impregnable, and not to be focred either by Arms or Famine: Whilst it was impossible for the Christian Army to continue long in that posture, both because they lay exposed to One hundred and fifty Pieces of Cannon of the Turks,Reasons for a Retreat. which plaid continually upon them, thô returned with like Damage again from those of the Christians: And also, because they began in that place to want both Forage and Provisions, so that there seemed a necessity for the Army to retire. Whereupon the Duke of Loraine obser∣ving that after he had for the space of 46 hours bid defiance to the Turkish Army, and that he could on no Terms provoke them to a Battle: He assembled a Council of War, where many things being alledged, in reference to the strong Encampment of the Turks,Agreed at the Chri∣stian Camp. their Resolution of keeping with∣in their Trenches, which were not to be for∣ced without danger of losing the whole Christian Army; and the want of Forage and Provisions in their own Camp, which were not to be supplyed in those places; it was resolved to make a Retreat, and re∣pass the Drave. Such an Action as this was now become difficult, and the Army not to be secured, but by the skill and bravery of such Gener∣als: For the Turks observing the Retreat of their Enemies, and believing it to be a kind of Flight, either out of weakness in Strength, or want of Courage, made many Assaults and Attacks on the Rear, which the Gener∣als with such admirable Art, Martial con∣duct, and Discipline defended, that in all the attempts they made, they were repulsed: Five Regiments under the Command of Pic∣colomini were commanded to March before to Siklos;Conduct in the Retreat and the rest of the Army to∣wards Walpo, drawn into two Lines, often facing the Turks to the Van, to the Rear, and on each side; in such manner, that it was almost impossible to break in upon them. The Turks,Against the A tacks of the Turks. who had not for some years seen the backs of their Enemies, and sel∣dom a Retreat made by them, full of vain Glory, and hopes of gaining a Victory pres∣sed very hard on the Rear, which being defended by the Valour, and excellent Conduct of that magnanimous, and ge∣nerous Prince the Elector of Bavaria, with the assistance of Prince Lewis of Baden, whose Arms and Conduct were dreaded by the Turks. There was little, or no ad∣vantage obtained that day by the Enemy, the Camp being that night pitched near Walpo.
The day following they proceeded in their March without any considerable op∣position from the Enemy, and encamped near the Drave, between Walpo and Ussona; only the Foragers thinking semselves so secure were attacked by the Enemy with the loss of many Men and Horse. The E∣lector of Bavaria having that day the command of his own Wing which was the Van-gard, caused almost all his Baggage to pass the Drave, which much disappointed the design of the Enemy: And the Duke of Loraine gave order, that all the Baggage, as well that belonging to the Soldiers, as to the Commanders, which could be transpor∣ted that night,The man∣ner how the Chri∣stians re∣passed the Drave. should be passed over: And the next day the Cavalry of the right Wing, after them the left Wing, then the Baggage of the Infantry; and the day following all the Infantry it self were passed over; all which being performed with most admirable order and conduct, the Bridges were broken, and the Boats burnt and sunk. As the Christi∣an Leaders shewed themselves great and va∣liant Captains; so the Turks gave no less proofs of their Cowardise, who might have made use of this advantage to the total de∣struction of the Christian Army, had not the Divine Hand preserved them for more signal Victories,The Joy which the Turks make for this Suc∣cess. and for the more severe punishment of the Turks; howsoever the Grand Vizier fancying this Retreat to be an entire Victory, dispatched Curriers with the News thereof to Constantinople, and to all parts of the Empire, glorying that he had now recover'd the lost Honour of the Otto∣man power, not doubting but in a short time to regain Buda, and all the conquer'd places, and to restore peace, and quietness once more with Honour to the Musselmin Dominions. This Opinion was celebrated in the Turkish Camp with Joy and Tri∣umph, and at the Port, and remote parts of the Empire with divers days of Festival, all believing that the side of Fortune was now turned under the auspicious Conduct of this Vizier, from whom great things, and almost Miracles were expected: In pursuance of this fancy and belief, so soon as the Imperialists had withdrawn from Esseck, the Turks detached a Body of Four thousand Horse towards Darda, with Orders to proceed thence to Mohatz, where they designed, if possible to burn all the Boats laden with Ammunition and Provision be∣longing to the Christian Army:Parties sent by the Turks to Darda. But this design was prevented by the March of Pic∣colomini, with some Regiments of Hussars and Croats, and of Count Cohari, who with Two thousand Hungarians was commanded to pass that way,July. and thence to proceed to joyn with the Marquis Doria, and reinforce him in the Blocade of Agria: Howsoever, the expedition of the Four thousand Turkish Horse was not altogether unsuccessful, for it was their fortune to meet with One hun∣dred and fifty Waggons belonging to the Ba∣varian Troops, under the Convoy only of Five hundred Croats, commanded by that brave Soldier Count Orlick; who notwith∣standing the inequality of numbers, su∣stained the Shock, and at last orderly re∣treated by the help of a Morass, with the loss of One hundred Men, which the Turks at their return to the Camp, reported for a signal Victory. The main Body of the Christian Army continuing their March, on the 28th pit∣ched their Camp, about a League distant from Mohatz, before which place all the Boats laden with Ammunition and Provisi∣ons for sustenance of the Army were then Riding in the River; and here it was that Five thousand Foot, and One thousand Horse from the Circles of Suabia,The Chri∣stian Army reinforced. and Fran∣conia joyned with the Army under the com∣mand of the Marquis Charles Gustavus of Baden Durlach; all choise and select Men, veterane Soldiers, and so well armed and clothed, that in their March towards the Camp, the Emperor took delight to see them pass through the Streets of Vienna: With these came also Count Rabata, Com∣missary General, bringing Money with him for the Subsistence and Payment of the Army; in which Office he so well acquitted himself for three or four years past, that much of the health, and convenient subsi∣stence of the Army, may well be attributed to his Industry and Mannagment, by which all things were provided in such plenty, that there was little need of sending Fora∣gers abroad with hazard and danger, for relief of the Camp. And indeed by the Successes of this year, it plainly appeared how great a Service such good Managment was;Loss by the Foragers. for want of which the Imperialists had not of late suffered in any thing a great∣er loss than in their Foragers, who wander∣ing abroad without care, or due circum∣spection, were often surprized by the Enemy with the loss of their Horses, and many of their Lives. The Grand Vizier finding that the Chri∣stian Army had repassed the Drave did be∣lieve that they would not sit idle, but un∣dertake some Enterprise or other, either by the Siege of Sigher, or some other place of importance; to prevent which by giving en∣couragement to the several Garrisons, the Vizier dispatched Expresses to all parts, to let them know that in case of a Siege, they should manfully resist, assuring them that in a short time, he would bring them Re∣lief, and such Succour as they should desire.
On the other side the Duke of Loraine seriously considering what Course the Enemy might in probability follow, and effect; he imagined, that their Design might be by a strong Convoy of Horse to Relieve Agria with Provisions;Means to intercept relief of Agria. of which (as we have said) there had been a long want; and such a scarcity as might reasonably be termed a Famine: To intercept this Relief Count Ziacchi with Two thousand Hungarians, and Count Veterani with five Regiments of Horse, were commanded to pass the Da∣nube, and draw towards Agria. It was re∣solved also to fortify Mohatz, and put a Garrison into it of Four thousand Men; but upon News brought to the Generals, that the Turks one the 29th of July had begun to pass the Drave near Esseck, all the Coun∣cils and Measures were changed;A Field Battle de∣signed. the De∣tachments, were recalled back to the main Body, the Bridges broken, the Boats laden with Provisions order'd to a certain Island, there to remain for better security; and in fine all things were disposed for a Field Bat∣tle, which the Christian Soldiers had long desired, and to see their Enemy in the o∣pen Plain, rather than fortified in the Tren∣ches of a Camp, or within the Walls of a City. The Turks having passed the River, advan∣ced towards Darda, and entrenched them∣selves very strongly between certain Mo∣rasses, or Marshes in that Country near Baranwar, about a League from the Impe∣rial Camp, where they much troubled and infested the Foragers belonging to the Chri∣stian Army. The Duke of Loraine being very desi∣rous to intice the Turks to a Battle, retreated towards Mohatz,August. 1687. which the Vizier interpre∣ting as a kind of Flight, caused many Thou∣sands of Turks and Tartars to advance; which being discover'd by the German Out-guards gave an Allarum to the whole Army, and put them all into form of Battle; but no∣thing thereupon happened,A Skir∣mish. but only a Skirmish between the Christian Volontiers and the advanced Body, the first of which being supported by some Regiments of Horse, that party of the Enemy was forced to Retire, and pass the Bridge. The Duke of Man∣toua at the Camp.About this time, Ferdinand Charles, the third Duke of Mantoua, being desirous to see, and learn the Art of War mannaged by the first and bravest Captains of the World, left the Air, and pleasant Places and Gar∣dens of Italy, to observe the Martial ex∣ploits acted in the more gross Air of Hun∣gary; and being attended with an Equipage agreeable, he enter'd the Christian Camp about the beginning of the Month of Au∣gust, where he was received by the Duke of Loraine, the Elector of Bavaria, and the other Generals with all the marks and de∣monstrations of Respect, and Honour due to a Prince of such Sublime Birth and Dig∣nity. As the Christian Army retreated, the Turks advanced, supposing that the Retreat was an assured evidence of their weakness. The Duke of Loraine was amazed, and glad to observe this confidence in the Turk, whom he had for a long time endeavoured to allure, and decoy into a Battle; of which there was a kind of a necessity at pre∣sent,A necessity to Fight. for the gross Air of that Season be∣came very pernicious to Bodies not accu∣stomed to that Climate, so that the Army began to grow Sickly, and wanting Forage which was necessary to be supplied, it was procured with a daily loss of Men taken, or killed by the Enemy, by which an Army worthy of higher Enterprises was in danger of being destroyed without Fighting or Action. It was therefore concluded neces∣sary to Fight, of which there appear'd great hopes from the forwardness of the Enemy, who animated with the March of the Christian Army, pursued after them. The Duke of Lorain intending to draw the Enemy after him, carried away all the Provisions in Boats up the Stream to Sertio, and set Fire to the Town of Mohatz, destroying all the subsi∣stence round the Country; and intending to do the like by Siklos and Quin{que} Ecclesiae, Letters were dispatched by a certain Captain to the Governours of those places to convey away all the Provision, and Ammunition they were able from those parts, and afterward to consume the Towns, and remaining Goods with Fire: But by the Providence and direction of God Almighty, it so hap∣pened, that this Captain being taken, and his Letters intercepted; he was brought to be examined before the Grand Vizier, and his Papers being read and considered at a Council of War called for that purpose; It was unanimously concluded, that this Re∣solution to burn those Towns was a certain evidence of the weakness of the Christian Army; and therefore that not to omit,The Turks resolve to Fight. and pass by so favourable an opportunity of gaining an entire Victory, it was resolved to come to a Battle with the Christians; and to that end the whole Turkish Army marched towards Siklos, and pitched in an open Country not far distant from the Town through which the Imperial Army was of necessity to pass, and there they o∣pened some new Trenches, and raised Works of some considerable defence. After that Mohatz was burnt; the Impe∣rialists in order of Battle took their March towards Siklos, not without some loss su∣stained by the Foragers, who wander'd at too far a distance, without due caution, or
re∣gard had to the near encampment of the Enemy: The Imperialists likewise continu∣ed their March. The day following Count Stirum advanced before with his Guards, and Scouts, as did all the Quarter-masters and Foragers, between whom and some Troops of Tartars a furious Skirmish hap∣pened within Trees and Boscage, which continued a long time with mutual loss on both sides, which fell most severly on the Regiment of Lodron. The Duke of Loraine finding himself to draw near to the Enemy, caused the right Wing, commanded by him∣self, to make a Halt under the Mount of Arschan, and the left Wing commanded by the Elector of Bavaria to make a stand on a rising Ground near Baraniovar, not more than an hour's March from the Enemy,Several Skirmi∣shes. where Six thousand of the Enemies Horse made an attack on some of the Imperial Troops, as others of them did on the Rear-guard commanded by the Elector of Bava∣ria, which Skirmishes took up some hours time: The same day the Prince of Comercy with Twelve hundred Horse, was com∣manded out to cover the Foragers; but he was not far advanced before he returned with advice, that the Enemy with the gross of their Army both of Horse and Foot had raised their Camp, and had posted them∣selves in a nearer and more advantagious place: This News was confirmed by a Gre∣cian youth of Retimo taken Captive by the Turks in Candia,August. who having made his es∣cape reported, That the Turkish Army consisted of Eighty thousand fighting Men,The Tur∣kish Army appears. of which there were Twenty five thousand Janisaries, and with the Attendants and Ser∣vants, they might make up in all the Num∣ber of One hundred and twenty thousand persons: And accordingly that Evening, three Encampments appear'd, consisting of three very great Bodies. The next day being the 12th of August, the Duke of Lorain having disposed his Af∣fairs in a Military posture, against all acci∣dents and contingences from the Enemy whatsoever, began his March towards Siklos with the right Wing, being then about an hour's March distant from Siklos. Scarce had he opened the Plain, when the Elector of Bavaria with his left Wing was attacked by Eight thousand of the Enemies Horse, sustained by Six thousand Janisaries,A Battle began at Harscham. who had the night before intrenched themselves on the side of a Hill, from whence they fired many Vollies of Shot on the three Re∣giments of Cavalry, viz. Arco, Magni and Soyer. Prince Lewis of Baden having observed, that there was a very advantagious place on the side of the Hill near to the Jani∣saries, which, if possessed, might very much annoy the Turks; immediately advertised the Dukes of Loraine and Bavaria thereof, who having in the first place reinforced the Rear-guards with four Regiments under the conduct of Piccolomini, gave it in charge to Prince Lewis, to take the Post he had de∣noted on the side of the Hill; which accor∣dingly he performed with admirable Suc∣cess; for the Janisaries having fired three Vollies, and the Spahees having furiously charged the Rear-guard as often; the Ele∣ctor encouraging his Men setled them firm and steddy against the frequent and forcible Shocks and Charges of the Enemy; who not being able to endure the Fire, and the unshaken order of the Christians, betook themselves to a disorderly and precipitate Flight, in which the Turkish Horse broke in upon their Foot, and trampling down the Janisaries under foot, drove them back into their Trenches,The Turks routed. into which entring at the same time with the Enemy, they put the whole Army to the Rout, and to a shame∣ful Flight, leaving their Camp, Tents and all their Baggage for a Prey to the Christi∣ans. On this memorable day, which is to be celebrated to all Posterity, the two Dukes, who were Generals, signalized themselves by their admirable Conduct, and undaunted Bravery, to all the World.The va∣lour of the Christian Comman∣ders. Prince Lewis of Baden in like manner, with his Sword in his Hand, applying himself at all places to di∣rect, and encourage the Soldiery by his Presence and Voice, demonstrated and evi∣denced himself to be a great Captain and Champion; in imitation of whom, and of all other the Commanders, the inferiour Offi∣cers and Soldiers gave marks to the World of their bravery and zeal in the Successes of that glorious day. The Prince Eugenie of Savoy was the first, who with the Regiments of his Brigade en∣tred the Trenches of the Enemy;The Prince of Savoy carries the News of Victory. His bravery. and for that reason had the honour to be the first Messenger of this happy News unto the Emperor. Count Sinzendorf, a Cavalier of great Courage, and Hope, adventuring his Person amidst the thickest of his Enemies, had Two Horses killed under him that day, and Two wounded, together with his Page, who fought on his Left-hand; and by a great Shot had his Leg broke: Howsoever he pursued the Enemy beyond their Trenches for the space of an hour, as did the rest of the Army, until the Close of the Evening, when it was thought fit to desist from the pursuit, and return to the Camp, that they might give Refreshment both to Man, and Horse, who had for two days greatly suffered for want both of Victuals, and Forage. The Prince of Commercy, who Commanded the Troops of Volontiers, deserved also his due Praise,
being one of the most forward to attack the Enemy, of which he gave undeniable Proofs, the Sargeant Major of his Regiment, and One hundred and Sixty of his Soldiers being slain at the beginning of the Battle. The whole Number killed and wounded on the Christian side,The Num∣bers killed and wound∣ed. were not much above One thousand, Three Captains, Twelve subal∣tern Officers, and Four Trumpeters; which indeed was very strange, and almost miracu∣lous, if we consider the great loss which the Turks sustained; for there were Eight thousand Janisaries with their Aga, or Ge∣neral, killed on the place, all choice and se∣lect Soldiers, Two thousand were made Prisoners, and about Three thousand Drowned, and the whole Army scattered and dispersed in the Woods, Marshes, and Boggs of that Country. Strange and wonderful indeed was the Success of this day, and ought wholly to be ascribed to the Almighty Hand of the God of Hosts: For the Turkish Army was much more numerous than the Christian, consisting in all of One hundred and twenty thou∣sand, of which Eighty thousand were Fight∣ing men, encouraged by late Successes, and grown proud, and confident of their Strength, by the Retreat which the Christians made. But what is still more strange, is that this formidable Army was Defeated, and put to Flight by Ten thousand men only of the Left-wing of the Rear-Guard, Commanded by the Elector of Bavaria; for the Right-wing under the Duke of Loraine, and Led by Count Caprara, had not time to come up, before the Turks were put to a Rout, and a Hasty Flight, which had they delayed and stood until the other Forces had come up, it might, in all probability, have proved so bloody a loss to the Turks, as could never more have been recovered, and which might have proved the total Ruin and Downfal of the Ottoman Empire. Thus since it was the Fortune of the Elector of Bavaria to Fight that day with Victorious Success,The Vi∣zier's Tent allotted to the Elector of Bavaria. the Magnificent Tent of the Grand Vizier, like opima spolia, were by Lot the just Reward of his Labour, and Valou. It is said, That that Tent was the most sumptuous and rich of any, that had, during this whole War, been brought by any preceeding General into the Field; therein was taken all the Cash, or Ready-Money brought for the Use of the Army, all the Books and Accounts belonging to the Militia, the Horse-tails or Tugh carried before the Vizier;The spoils taken. besides Fifty thousand Crowns, which some principal Officers, as is said, appropriated to their own Use. Besides this stately Tent, there were great Numbers of other Tents taken, in which the Turks show most of their Grandeur, ma∣king more Ostentation by their Tents, in the Camp, than they do by their Houses, and Edifices in the City. Moreover there were taken Sixty seven Pieces of Canon, Four of which were of an extraordinary bigness; of Powder there was a Thousand Kintals, of Match Four hundred, about Eight thousand Cannon-Bullets, Three thou∣sand Bombs and Carcasses, Ten thousand Granadoes, Arms of all sorts in great Num∣bers, Two thousand Oxen, Five hundred Horse, Mules, Asses, and Camels about Two hundred, Buffoloes Four hundred, which were appointed and fitted to the Yoke, for drawing Carriages, and Cannon; Sheep, and other Cattle innumerable. Besides all this, there were found great quantities of Coffee, Chocolate, Sugar, Sherbet, and Honey, with Carpets, and Beds of Wool, and Cotton: Also Oats, Rice, Barley, Flower, Oyl, Bread, and Salt; in short, all things necessary and con∣venient for Man and Beast; with which the Christian Soldiers refreshed themselves after a long Battle, tedious and tiresome Marches, in great Want, and Scarcity of all Necessa∣ries for Support and sustenance of an Ar∣my. After which great and signal Victory,August. 1687. Te Deum was on the 13th of August Sung in the Tent of the Grand Vizier; and Triumphs made by exposing the Horse-tails,Te Deum Sung in the Vizier's Tent. and great Numbers of Banners and Ensigns before the Door of the Tent, with Vollies of small Shot, and Discharge of Four hundred Pieces of Cannon, giving Thanks to God for this so remarkable a Success, which was the more observable, because this Victory was obtained in that very Ground, where Lodowick, the last of the Hungarian Kings was Slain, and his Army Routed by Sultan Soliman the Magnificent, who in Memory thereof, cau∣sed a Mosch of Wood to be Erected, and Endowed it with Eight hundred Crowns Yearly Rent, that Dervises, who are a sort of Turkish Friers, might solemnize their daily Devotions and Prayers in that place. The Turkish Army being thus totally Routed, and Dispersed, some in the Woods, and others in the Marshes, where many of them dyed of their Wounds, or fainted for want of Food, or Refreshments; others of them, or as many, as could, Travelling a Day and a Night, came at length faint and weary to lodge themselves under the Walls and Cannon of Esseck, without Provision to comfort them, or Tents to cover them; where being sad and disconsolate, had the Mortification to hear the Triumphs which the Christians were making in their Camp for their Victorious Successes. This News affected the Inhabitants of Agria to the last extremity of Despair:Agria surrenders. They had lived for a long time in hope of Re∣lief;
and feeding on that, and on Horse-Flesh, and Dogs, and Herbs growing under the Walls, and by making sometimes Ex∣cursions near hand to gain a little sustenance; but now by this last blow being put beyond all hopes, the People had thoughts privately to abandon the Town, and fly to other Quarters; but the Town being closely blocked up by Marquess Doria, was forced soon afterwards to surrender at discretion, without any farther Effusion of Blood. The Suceess of this Battle, near Harscham, happened very seasonable to the Christian Cause, and of great Comfort and Joy to the Court of Vienna, where they had lately received no very good News in reference to the State of their Army, which, as Report∣ed,Fears at Vienna. was very much weakened by late Skir∣mishes, Sicknesses, and want of Provisions, and much harassed by long Marches, bad Weather, and dirty deep Ways: Of which the Enemy being sensible, was grown bold and daring, and often pressed them to a Battle: The Emperor being informed hereof, was very doubtful and anxious for the Suc∣cess; and Prayers, Supplications and Penance were ordered to be made in all Churches to implore the Divine Assistance and Blessing; when the Prince Eugene of Savoy arrived at Vienna with the News of the Battle, and the Particulars of the Victory, which filled all the Court and City with Joy and Triumph:Joy at the News of Victory. To render which the more compleat and full, Advices were come the Night before from the Senate of Venice, to give an Account to his Imperial Majesty of the Defeat which the Arms of St. Mark had given the Turks in the Morea; which had produced such a Terror and Consternation amongst them, that in little more than Four and twenty Hours time, Four places had surrendered to the Venetians. With these happy Advices, Expresses being dispatched to all Courts of Christian Princes, were the Cause and Subject of common Joy and Jubilee, in the Courts of all, the most Christian Kings only excepted. The Grand Vizier with his scattered Troops rallied near Esseck; where taking an account of the Numbers lost, he found his Army diminished about Twenty thou∣sand men; for besides those which were kil∣led, taken, and drown'd, many had desert∣ed, and withdrawn from the Field. The Face of the whole Camp was sad and dis∣consolate; and thô the Vizier did all he could to comfort and chear them; yet they being not only melancholy, but angry, and ashamed of their dishonourable Flight, be∣gan to blame and cast the fault on each other. The Janisaries with good reason up∣braided the Spahees,Dissentions amongst the Turkish Militia. as the Authors of their Rout; for that they cowardly retiring, broke in upon their Ranks, and put them into disorder; which the Enemy observing, pressed so hard upon them, that they were forced to give way, and with them the whole Army was laid open, and exposed to the Enemy. The Dispute grew so hot be∣tween the Two Ranks, and Orders of Sol∣diers, who were always emulous of each other, that at length they came to Blows, and to a Civil War, in which about Seven hundred were killed upon the place. The Grand Vizier, and Officers had no sooner with much pain and labour parted the Fray, but the tumultuous Soldiery joyn∣ed together to accuse the Vizier himself, and to cry out, that the loss of the day was to be charged on him, and the Myrmidons about him, who were the most forward to show an Example to the Soldiery of a base and fearful Flight; the which Clamour cau∣sed such a Mutiny in the Camp, as had put the Life of the Vizier,Appeased with Mony. and many great Offi∣cers into extreme danger, had not the Vi∣zier with Money and fair words mollified their Anger. But this accommodation con∣tinued not long, before the Grand Vizier was forced to give way to the irresistible fury and sedition of the Soldiery, as we shall presently have occasion to declare. In the mean time the Duke of Loraine, not to lose the benefit and advantage of so glorious a Victory, designed a farther Con∣quest, and to conclude the Campaigne, with some other memorable Enterprize. It was the common Talk at Vienna amongst the Courtiers, at the Emperor's Palaces, and amongst the Religious men in their Con∣vents and Monasteries; that the Duke of Loraine was to prosecute his Victory without delay as far as Belgrade, and thence to pass to Adrianople, and make that City his Head Quarters for this Winter; but these men, who had reposed themselves quietly at home, had not the Thoughts, nor Consi∣deration of the great Generals, to know the Sufferings and Hardship which the Cavalry had sustained this Summer in passing Boggs and Marshes, by want of Forage, and long Marches; nor the difficulty of passing the River of Drave, defended by the strong For∣tress of Esseck, nor the Season of the Year too far spent to undertake any great Enter∣prize: All which being considered by the Two Great Captains, the Duke of Loraine, and the Elector of Bavaria;Forces sent under Dunewalt. they resolved only to send a detachment of Ten thousand men, under Command of General Dunewalt, to pass the Drave at Turanovitz, and there to undertake such designs, as should be thought most facile and feasible, without over-much hazard to be put in Execution. Dunewalt accordingly began his March on the 17th towards Siklos, where he was fur∣nished with 18 Pieces of heavy Cannon, and
Four Mortars taken lately from the Enemy, of which he was to make use in case of a Siege, or other occasion; and was there re∣inforced with a considerable Body of Croats, under Command of their Bano. The Duke of Loraine in the mean time took his march with the remainder of his Army towards Mohatz, with design to pass the Danube, and on that side to refresh his Army, and allot out to them Quarters for the Winter in Transilvania, Moldavia, and Valachia, obli∣ging those Hospodars, or Princes to yield Obedience to his Imperial Majesty, and pay Contributions, by which means not on∣ly the Hereditary Countries of the Emperor, but the wasted and consumed Provinces of Hungary would be eased, and relieved of their long burdens and distresses.The Duke of Loraine passes the Danube. Some Leagues above Mohatz, the Duke of Loraine passed the Danube with all his Baggage, and Train of Artillery, at a place, where he had the advantage of an Island in the midst of the River, to lay more easily their Bridges. The Army having passed the Wa∣ter with all their Artillery and Baggage, it was expected by some, and so made the common Discourse, that a farther Enter∣prize would be undertaken, and that the Army would march towards Peter-Waradin, and thence proceed to the Siege of Esseck; but this design after mature consultation, appeared too difficult in this present Season: For that great Floods of Rain had fallen, and so filled the Rivers that the Waters could not be contained within their Channel, but overflowed all the Fields and Meadows bor∣dering on the River; and afterwards when the Water abated, they had yet covered the Grounds with so much Mire and Sand, that it was impossible to march near to the Brink of the River, so as to have the benefit or use of their Boats for Carriage of their Fo∣rage and Provisions: Wherefore it was resol∣ved to Lade the Provisions and Baggage on Carts,Provisions laden on Carts. and take their march with the whole Army towards Segedin: The Boats being emptied and discharged, were all burnt, as needless and cumbersome; and the greater Barges on which the Cannon and Ammuni∣tion were laden, were drawn up the River by Horses and Oxen, attended with a Con∣voy of three Regiments of Horse and Dra∣goons: And in this manner Loraine took his March towards the Tibiscus; but the E∣lector of Bavaria judging that the Campaign was so far spent, that no great Enterprize was more to be atchieved, having commit∣ted his Troops to the care and conduct of the Duke of Loraine, he together with Prince Lewis of Baden took his way towards the City of Vienna. But this March proved much more diffi∣cult than was imagined or expected; for the Ways and Fields by the continual Rains were so deep and rotten, and full of Water,The diffi∣culty of marching. that the Army instead of being relieved, and eased of their late Fatigues and Suffer∣ing, seemed to be engaged and engolfed in greater; for their March was in Mire and Dirt to the Mid-leg, the Weather very Raw and Cold, without Wood or other Fuel to dry and warm them at the end of their day's March; and without any other Su∣stenance, than dry Bisket softned with bad Water, such as was found in the Ditches and the Ways; so that it was not strange that the Army should grow Sickly, and weakned with so many and so long suffer∣ings. Some Troops of the Turks, who had fled to Peter Waradin having notice hereof, order'd a Detachment of some Forces be∣longing to Tekeli, joyned to a strong party of Turks and Tartars,Sickly and infirm at∣tacked by the Turks. to fall in upon the Rear of the Imperialists, which often-times hapned to the great loss and hurt of the sickly and infirm, who were miserably cut to pieces, and slain by the Enemy. Nor was the Cavalry in a much better Conditi∣on, for travelling over Marshes and Wet-grounds, their Horses died for want of Forage. The Duke of Loraine with his principal Commanders considering hereof,The Foot carried in Carts. order'd that all Officers having Carts should ap∣ply them to the use of the sickly and weak Infantry; and to give a good Example here∣in to others, he was the first to proffer his own Waggons, which all other Officers ob∣serving, generously afforded their Carriages to the use of the Foot, by which the Army was wonderfully relieved, and after many hardships were brought near to the Quarters of Segedin, where the Air and Waters being more wholsome,The Sick recover at Segedin. and the Forage and Provi∣sions more plentiful, the Sick began to re∣cover, and after some few days of rest and refreshment, the whole Army was in a great measure restcr'd to perfect Health and strong Condition: After which they marched to Zolnock, where they found plenty of all Provisions and Forage,And Zol∣nock. provided and ga∣thered by the abundant care, and indu∣stry of Count Caraffa chief Governour of the upper Hungary: And thence they march∣ed to Debrezin, from whence the Duke of Loraine detached the Regiment of Cuirassi∣ers commanded by Count Palfi, with the Regiment of Foot belonging to Count Sta∣remberg, with Orders to march unto Posso∣nium or Presburg, there to assist at the Co∣ronation of the Arch-Duke Joseph, Son of the Emperor, then created King of the Ro∣mans. But to return now to the Turkish Camp, where we may believe, that after so fatal a Rout there was great Confusion: The
Grand Vizier retired from Esseck to Peter Waradin, where he intended to muster up his Forces,Sedition in the Tu kish Camp. and to recount his loss, and make the best stand he could against the far∣the Progress of the Christian Arms; but the Turkish Troops instead of yielding obe∣dience to their Commanders, publickly arose against the Vizier, boldly demanding of him five Months pay, and the surrender of Mahomet's Colours or Standard: Upon which Insolence the Grand Vizier fled to Belgrade, sending before him Fourteen Mules laden with Money; at which the Militia being more enraged, proposed to Elect Os∣man Pasha, Ogli or Sciaus Pasha for their Leader: For with both these the Vizier had a Quarrel before the Battle, and after it up∣on his Complaints made against them to the Grand Seignior, for not having done their Duty in the Fight, had obtained a Haste she∣riff, or a Royal command to Strangle or Banish them, as he judged most for Service of the Sultan; but Soliman the Vizier be∣ing averse to Blood, laid the Command by him, without Execution of it, which com∣ing to the knowledge of these two turbu∣lent Men, they raised the Militia against him; who offered to acknowledge Osman Pasha for their General, provided he would undertake to kill the Vizier; which Enter∣prize he readily accepted, and enter'd the Vizier's Tents, where he killed several of his Servants and Pages; as he did also the Vizier's Kahya or Deputy,Sciaus Pasha made Ge∣neral. who sent to ap∣pease the Mutiny; but the Vizier himself escaped in a Boat down the Danube, accom∣panied with the Tefterdar or Lord Trea∣surer, and Reis Effendi or Secretary of State, upon notice of which the Soldiery elected Sciaus Pasha for their General, laying Osman Pasha aside, notwithstanding his late Ser∣vice, having been a Rebel and Robber in Asia. Thus the Sedition being begun, a great Revolution followed in the Empire; which was not so much caused by the defeat of the Turkish Army, as by the natural Tem∣per of the Vizier, and the Poverty of the Treasury which could not furnish Money sufficient for payment of the Soldiery. For thô Solyman was a Man of dexterity in Negotiations, and well qualified for a Court;A Chara∣cter of the Vizier. yet being of a mild Nature was not so proper to command a Camp, wanting that Vigour, and Martial Spirit which should make him severe, so as to be fear'd and respected: Besides, having little expe∣rience in War, and of an open and free Humour, lent his Ear to every Adviser, so that amongst diversity of Opinions he became confused and unresolved, and instead of go∣verning was governed, and sometimes made to act against his own Judgment. Tis true, the Vizier had by his care and industry ga∣thered a powerful Army and good Troops for this Campaign; for he had summoned all the Otoracks, or Soldiers who had for∣merly been freed and exempted from the War, and had long lived at ease, and with convenience at their own Houses, to return again to the Camp, and to the severities of Martial Discipline; many of which had been Spectators or Actors in the Munities, during the Minority of Sultan Mahomet, and wanting now pay, and their accustom∣ed ease, were soon incited to Sedition on the first occasion, which now hapned up∣on these Misfortunes, and the Flight of the Vizier. The Sedition being thus begun, we will leave the Mutiniers for a while and return to the Exploits of General Dunewalt, and then relate at large the great Revolution which after this ensued at the Port. Dune∣walt had continued his March for several days from Siklos, and at length without any considerable Encounter, he came to Turno∣vitz, where he laid a Bridge and passed the Drave; and being there relieved with Pro∣visions, he proceeded to the attack of Wuch∣ing, a Castle well fortified, and the Garri∣son lately reinforced with a Thousand Tar∣tars: And thô the Ways were deep and bad, and the Weather rainy and wet, yet no∣thing was impossible for a victorious Ar∣my, which marched along the side of some Hills, where the Ways were more hard and dry. Count Lodron with his Regiment, and Count Budiani with some hundreds of Hus∣sars, and a Sargent Major with Two hun∣dred Dragoons, were commanded to ad∣vance before to Invest Wuchin, and to hin∣der all Succours which might be sent for its Relief, until the Mortars and Cannon, and the rest of the Army could come up. At length the Bombs, and Train of Artillery being with much labour and difficulty arrived; Batteries were raised, and the place sum∣moned to Surrender; to which at first a haughty and an obstinate Answer was re∣turned, but the Cannon being mounted and fired, in the space of one day had made such a Breach, that the Turks considering the Resolution of the Christians, and the imposibility of being relieved, displaid a white Flag, and desired to Capitulate.Wuchin taken by Dunewalt: At first they demanded liberty to March out like Soldiers with Arms and Baggage, but that being denied them, with all other Con∣ditions, excepting only to yield at Discreti∣on, they were forced to submit to the Will of the Conquerour, and lose their Freedom and Estates, to save their Lives. In the Garrison were about Three hundred Soldi∣ers, besides more than One hundred Women and Children: The principal Prisoners of
note, were shared amongst the Generals, and chief Officers of Horse, and the others equally divided amongst the Regiments of Foot. After taking this Castle, which is Situate on a Rock, and in a pleasant and plentiful Country, abounding with Trees and Fruit, and well planted with Vine-yards; and after refreshment given to the Army for some few days, it was resolved to March to Walpo, and there to remain in expectation of farther Orders from the Imperial Court:Sept. 1687. During which time certain Advice was brought, that the Grand Vizier with all his Army and Equipage, was retired from Esseck to Peter Waradin, and thence to Belgrade, with intention totally to abandon the Fortress of Esseck. Upon this News Dunewalt having refreshed his Army near Walpo for some days,Hofkirchen with a party make an Excur∣sion as far as Esseck. after a tedious March through a wa∣sted and desolate Country full of Boggs and Marshes, he ordered a party of Five hun∣dred Horse, under command of Count Hof∣kirchen, Lieutenant Colonel of that Regi∣ment, to make an Excursion as far a Esseck, and learn the State of that Garrison, and the Forces of the Enemy thereabouts. Hofkir∣chen had been out two days, without any Discovery, or giving advice of any thing to the General, whom he found encamped un∣der Walpo, a place defended by Five hun∣dred Turks, who at first Summons seem-very resolute to defend themselves, or at least, not to yield until they had first heard that Esseck had submitted. Hereupon Bat∣teries were mounted,Walpo Invested. which with frequent firing at the Castle gave an Alarum to the Country round about; but whilst these Mat∣ters were in agitation, intelligence was brought to the Camp by a Country Fellow, that whilst Hofkirchen remained in the Woods to make Discovery of the Enemy's Motion, the Garrison taking it to be the Van-guard of the Army, were struck with such a fear, that they immediately resolved to abandon the place; and having laden the best of their Moveables and Goods on Boats, the Garrison and all the Inhabitants forsook the place, and fled to Peter Wara∣din. General Dunewalt taking this Relation from the Country-man to be true, com∣manded the three Regiments of Lodron, Count Kisel and Hofkirchen to March unto Esseck, and take possession of the place, in case it were abandoned, as before repor∣ted. Accordingly these Forces being come near Esseck; the day following they were met by a Turk, and a Renegado Croat, who, having made humble instances for their Lives, which were granted them; they confirmed the intelligence of the Turks ha∣ving abandoned Esseck, to be true, and like∣wise informed them, that the Turks before they left the place, had formed five Mines under the Walls, which they would disco∣ver to them; and accordingly Lodron having appointed Thirty of his Men with some Rascians to uncharge the Mines, he marched with his whole Body and took possession of that considerable and important place of Esseck without any opposition,Esseck a∣bandoned by the Turks. before which (as we have related) two great Armies lately lay encamped. With this advice Count Lo∣dron immediately dispatched an Express to Dunewalt, giving him an account that he had taken possession of Esseck, and had found therein Fifty five Pieces of Cannon, two Mortar Pieces, two Petards, with a great quantity of Ammunition and Provi∣sion of all sorts;Walpo Surrenders. the Garrison of Walpo be∣ing also assured hereof, lost their Courage, and surrender'd forthwith at Discretion, sub∣mitting themselves, their Wives and Chil∣dren to Slavery. After which,Octob. 1687. things being well secured and order'd at Walpo, Dunewalt marched towards Esseck, and encamped his Army on the 2d of October in the same place, where the Grand Vizier had lately intren∣ched: Where having sung Te Deum, and re∣turned Thanks to Almighty God for so many and great Successes, a Council of War was called to consider what was the next great Enterprize which was to be undertaken. The Season of the Year being advanced towards Winter; it might well be judged a convenient time to draw the Soldiers into Quarters, and give the Troops rest and re∣pose after the many Fatigues and Hardships sustained; but God still favouring the De∣signs of the Christians against the Turks, who were in all places possessed with fear and consternation; it was thought fit by the Commanders to follow the Foot-steps of Fortune, and not to give over the Game with a lucky Hand; wherefore Count Appre∣mont being left in the Government of Es∣seck, with a Garrison of Eighteen Compa∣nies of Foot, and Sixteen Troops of Horse, the General resolved to attack Possega, the Metropolis of all Sclavonia; and in his March thither he summoned the Castle of Orovitza, Situate on a high Hill, an the Foot of which is a Palancha, or small Re∣doubt; the Ground is covered with Chesnut-Trees, and planted with Fruit Trees; the Garrison at first returned an angry and reso∣lute Answer,The Turks quit Oro∣vitza. but afterwards thinking better with themselves, they packed up the best of their Goods and Baggage, and in the night by secret and By-ways through the Woods and Mountains privately stole away, every one shifting for himself in the best manner he was able: So that in the morning the Christians enter'd the Town and Castle without any opposition; being a place very
Commodious, to which several Villages paid Contribution, and which was neces∣sary first to be taken, in order to the more easy and safe attack of Possega. The very same day that Dunewalt enter'd into Orovitza, intelligence was brought him, that the Turks were possessed with such great Fear and Consternation at Possega, that there was no doubt to be made, but that the place would Surrender at his first appearance before it; which accordingly happened; for no sooner were the Christian Forces descended into the Plains, but they espied a considerable body of Turks, that ranged themselves un∣der the Cannon of Possega. The Forces of Dunewalt being come up, several Skirmishes passed between the Parties, but the Turks finding themselves unable to engage with such an unequal Force,Possega quitted by the Turks. they betook them∣selves to flight into the Mountains, aban∣doning the City and Castle to the possession of the Christians: Five Companies pursued them into the Mountains, but without any effect, for having neither knowledge of the Ways, nor Sustenance in that desolate Coun∣try, being also wearied and tired with long Marches, were forced to return, and repose themselves in Possega. Fortune thus favouring the Progress of the Christian Arms, Dunewalt resolved to make use of this prosperous Gale; and ha∣ving in order thereunto held a Council of War, it was resolved to follow the Enemy to the River Save, where at a place called Kobas they were Transporting themselves and Baggage to the other side: In order un∣to which,It is gar∣risoned by the Ger∣mans. and for better security of Possega, a Garrison of Sixteen hundred Germans were left in the place, and orders given to Count Lodron, that being come thither with the Infantry and Baggage, he should repose and refresh his Men there until the return of Dunewalt; who losing no time came so op∣portunly to the Save,Dunewalt Marches to Kobas. as to surprize some Carts laden with Corn and Provisions, which the Enemy had left there, not having time to Transport them to the other side; and in the mean time Count Leoneda, Lieu∣tenant Colonel of the Regiments of Lodron, a brisk and daring Gentleman, pursued a party of the Enemy's Horse, and skirmi∣shed with them for the space of three hours, and put them to flight, returning back to the Camp over against Kobas, with a Booty of Two hundred Head of Cattle. At this place Dunewalt continued for the space of three days, endeavouring to pass the River with design to burn and demolish that Castle; and thô on the other side there appeared a Body of Eight hundred Turks, Horse and Foot; yet some Germans endeavoured to pass in small Boats, and to take a Post, or place of Defence; but before they could be seconded by other Forces, they were at∣tacked by Two hundred Turks,A party of Germans cut off. and after a valorous defence were most of them cut in pieces, or droven into the River. Dunewalt finding it very difficult to pass the River without the help of great Boats, returned to Possega, where finding the Cannon and Infantry arrived, he proceeded to Zer∣neck, about two Hungarian Leagues distant from Possega, which the Turks having quitted, the Germans without opposition made their entrance into it:The Turks quit Zer∣neck. The day following Count Hofkirchen was detached from this place, with a party of Five hundred Croats, to take a view of the Enemies State and Con∣dition about Gradisca; on his March where∣unto, he was encountred by a strong party of Turks, with whom entring into an En∣gagement, Hofkirchen was wounded by a Musquet Bullet in his Arm, and Count Har∣imberg in the right Hand with a Lance; two Common Soldiers were killed,A Skir∣mish. and some few others wounded: Howsoever Hofkir∣chen missed not of the intelligence he design∣ed; bringing an account at his return, that the City of Gradisca was strong, garrisoned by Ten thousand Soldiers, cover'd by Five thousand Horse which were quartered in parts adjacent; and that in the Way to the City, the Passages were very Streight, be∣sides many Woods, and three Bridges which lay in the Road thither. Upon this Advice the design against Gradisca was deferr'd; and a great part of the Militia was employ∣ed to fortifie Zerneck, and the Towns lately conquer'd; and to provide them with good Garrisons, as also Valkowa: After which the Season being far spent,Dunewalts Army lodg∣ed in Win∣ter-quar∣ters. and Provisions and Forage beginning to want in the Camp, the remainder of the Army were lodged and laid up in their Winter-quarters in Croatia. Not∣withstanding all which Successes, there were not such wanting, who blamed these pro∣ceedings, and confidently affirmed, that in case Dunewalt had been inforced with some Regiments, and had laid all other Designs aside, he might in that great consternation of the Turks have passed the Save, and made himself Master of Belgrade without much difficulty, and therewith have reduced all Bosnia to the devotion of the Emperor. But this being an Over-sight, and matters succeeding as before related; let us return to the mutinous Army of the Turks, whom we lately left raging against the Grand Vi∣zier, the Grand Seignior and all the Go∣vernment. The Grand Vizier, as we have said, ha∣ving quitted the Army, to give way to the Fury of the Soldiers, took a Boat at Bel∣grade and rowed down the Danube, accom∣panied with the Tefterdar or Lord Trea∣surer, and the Reis Effendi or Secretary of
State; the Soldiers in the mean time chose (as is aforesaid) Sciaus for their General;A Chiaus sent by the Army to the Sultan. and immediately dispatched away Orta Chi∣aus, an Officer of the Janisaries, to ac∣quaint the Grand Seignior with what the Army had done. It was now no time to expostulate with the Soldiers, or disapprove their Actions; but on the contrary Orta was kindly received, and caressed by the Chima∣can at Constantinople called Regeb Pasha: And the Grand Seignior himself without any Hesistancy confirming the Choice which the Army had made,The Grand Seignior approves of what they had done. dispatched Orta Chi∣aus immediately back with the Signals of Honour, which are a Sword, and a Vest of Sables, declaring him General, and ordering him to take care of the Frontiers. The Vi∣zier having got out of the reach of the Army, took Post and came to Adrianople, where he staid, and gave time for his Friends to work in his behalf with the Grand Seignior; who of himself was well e∣nough inclined to Solyman; and therefore after the Rout, and Noise was a while appeased, Regeb the Chimacam obtained his Pardon, and Permission for him to come to Constanti∣nople, and Mamout Aga his Friend, and a rich Man was sent for the Messenger to in∣vite him thither. But before Solyman arri∣ved the Scene was much changed by the coming of four Officers from the Army,The Army Petitions against So∣lyman. with Arz and Max-Arz, which is a Petiti∣on, and Certificate signed by the principal Commanders in the Army, attesting that Solyman was a Person of no Conduct, a Coward and a Lyer, and one who took no care to pay the Army, and in short that he was not fit for that Sublime Office of Grand Vizier, concluding their Petition with a Prayer, that another might be placed in that Government: Solyman having News hereof, as he was on the Road to Con∣stantinople, and thinking thereupon that, that place would be too hot for him at pre∣sent; sent the Seal and the Standard of the Prophet to the Sultan, committing them to the care of the Tefterdar the Treasurer, and Reis Effendi the Secretary,He deli∣vers up the Seal and Stan∣dard. his Friends and fellow Travellers, to be delivered by them, conveying himself privately within the Walls of Constantinople; upon which, without de∣lay the Grand Seignior dispatched away the Seal and the Standard to Sciaus, declaring him Grand Vizier in the place of Solyman. Regeb would have disswaded the Grand Seig∣nior from sending the Standard, which is the Colours of their Prophet Mahomet; and towards which the People bear a super∣stitious Devotion, alledging that thereby he weakned himself, and armed a Company of Mutiniers with the Charm of that holy Relick: Howsoever the Kuzlier Aga, who is the chief Eunuch of the Women, was of a different Opinion, being of a nature ti∣morous like that of the Grand Seignior: His Council prevailed, and the Standard was sent by the Hand of the Selictar or Sword bearer, that the Soldiery might not have cause to believe, that the Sultan treated them with reserves, or with the least manner of diffi∣dence. But all this served not to appease, or mollify the madness of the Soldiery, who now talked of nothing but marching to Con∣stantinople, and there to Depose the Grand Seignior, and reform the Government, set∣ting up his Brother Sultan Solyman, under whose Reign they hoped for the like Auspi∣cious Successes, as they had found in the fortunate Reigns of those Sultans, who had formed the Ottoman Empire; and especially they had a singular Reverence for the Name of Sultan Solyman, who, they hoped would prove as great and fortunate as Solyman the Magnificent. Sciaus Pasha, who was in his Heart a cordial Friend to the late Vizier So∣lyman, found now that he had conjured up a Devil he could not lay, would gladly have disswaded the Soldiery from their designed March to the Port, and rather advised them to guard their Frontiers, and oppose the E∣nemy: But this Council had cost him his Life,Sciaus un∣willing to March. had he not touched the Proposal very gently, and at the same time assured them of his readiness to joyn with them in any Design they should contrive: And accor∣dingly marching away in a kind of a tu∣multuous, and disorderly manner towards the River Save, great Numbers of them were actually passing the Bridge near Bel∣grade, when the Chimacam or Governour General of the Janisaries of that place, ap∣prehending that they came to Plunder the Town, refused them Passage, causing several Pieces of Cannon to be fired upon them; with which several being killed they return∣ed back:They shoot at the Sol∣diers from Belgrade. Howsoever persisting still in their Resolution, the most wild and obstinate party of them passed the River in Boats at some distance from the Town, leaving Sci∣aus Pasha with the rest of the Militia on the other side, a good days March behind them; by this slow Motion of Sciaus, the Soldiery guessing at his backwardness to engage with them, like enraged Mad-men they returned to him and treated him with Menaces, vowing to kill him, in case he refused to be their General and Leader in this good Cause of reforming the Govern∣ment. Whilst the Army was in this Commoti∣on, great were the Confusions, Plots, Stra∣tagems and Contrivances at Constantinople, which Regeb the Chimacam suspecting, that the Friends of the late Vizier Ibrahim exi∣led to Rhodes, did foment, and also,Toubles at Constanti∣nople. that the Mufti who was last year Banished to Prusa
was too near; he procured a Command from the Grand Seignior to remove that Mufti to Rhodes, and the Kapugibashee or Messenger, who was employed on this Affair, and had the care upon him to conduct this Mufti to Rhodes, carried also a Hatte-sheriff, or the Command with him for the Head of Ibrahim Pasha, which we shall shortly find at Con∣stantinople, about the same time almost that Regeb's Head was laid with others to aug∣ment the heap. In the mean time the Tefterdar or Trea∣surer, and the Reis Effendi, or Secretary, who were the Two Fellow-Travellers with Soly∣man the late Vizier, were dispatched to the Army with soft Messages from the Grand Seignior, approving all that they had done, and offering to perform all they did or could desire: But we shall see presently how well these Two Mediators succeeded in their Office of making Peace with a heady Multitude, which would hear no Reason and endure no Government.The Soldiers take an Oath to re∣form the Govern∣ment. For Sciaus was now made only a Property to execute the Commands of the Janisaries, and Spahees, who had en∣tred into a solemn Covenant, and military Oath to stand by each other for Reformati∣on of the Government: In pursuance of which design, they were to march directly to Constantinople, there to remove all the Favourite Pages, and Idle Eunuchs in the Seraglio, with Solyman, Regeb, the Chimacam, and all their Creatures, and Dependants, and now began to talk openly of deposing Sultan Mahomet, and setting up Solyman his Brother in the Throne. And yet for all this, Sultan Mahomet was so stupid, that without any care or concernment he went every day a Hunting, and had continued his Sport until the Mutiniers had surprized him in the Field,Septem. 1687. had not Regeb the Chimacam, a man of great Courage and Capacity acquainted him with his danger, advising him that the Storm was growing black round about him, and therefore that he should retire into the Seraglio,Regeb gives Coun∣cil, but not taken. and prepare for his defence; shew∣ing him now his Error, in sending away the Prophet's Banner, which in such an extremi∣ty as this, had been his chief Protection; but the Grand Seignior had neither Under∣standing to see his danger, nor Courage to avoid it, or to embrace a bold and vigorous Council, which was necessary in this emer∣gency; but Regeb being qualified for both, and sufficiently alarum'd by the Chiohadar, an Officer of the Janisaries, newly arrived from the Army, of the great Combustions amongst them, and of the true state of things, without losing time, went the next day to the Mufti to desire a Fetfa, or Sen∣tence declaring them all Rebels and Infidels, (whom they call Gaürs) who would not obey the Commands of the Grand Signior; but the Mufti being either sick, or at least pretending to be so, the Fetfa could not be obtained: Thence he went to the Segmen∣bashee, who was in the place of the Aga of the Janisaries, whom he found well inclined; but the Kuzlir Aga, a timorous Eunuch,The Kuzlir Aaga's Council against Regeb. ha∣ving information from his Spyes of the Mo∣tions of Regeb, presently represented them to the Grand Seignior, as if he were contri∣ving his Peace with the Army, intending to betray and sacrifice all others to their fury and madness; and that therefore it would be better to be before-hand with him, and send both his and the Head of Solyman to make an Attonement for the lives of others. The Grand Seignior liking the Project extremely well, gave a Command immediately to the Bostangibashee, who is a great man, and chief of the Gardiners, to seize Regeb in his House, and carry him to Prison. The Com∣mand being accordingly served, and shewed to Regeb,Regeb seized. he seemed not in the least sur∣prized, but entertained the Bostangibashee without any alteration in a free and facetious Discourse; giving Orders very unconcern∣edly to have his Horse made ready: And going out with the Bostangibashee, his Bo∣stangees or Servants going down before him, he stopt short at the Head of the Stairs, and turning about, said, Aga, It would not be amiss, if I should take some Zechins into the Prison with me; come with me into my Chamber for them: So turning quick about, he en∣ters into a Room; the Bostangibashee being surprized, followed him in;He escapes. but Regeb pas∣sed nimbly into an inner Room through a kind of Cup-board Door, and by a pair of back-stairs into the Garden, and so escaped at a Postern-door. The Bostangibashee looking about for him, thought he was vanished, he knew not how; and calling his Servants about him, put all the House into an uproar; but there was no remedy, for the Prisoner was escaped and his Kahya, or Steward, had time also to get out of the way, thô Two days afterwards he surrendered himself, and the Hasnadar or Treasurer, and Chiohadar, or Master of his Wardrobe were also imprisoned:Others are seized, and Solyman the Vizier is taken. And about the same time also Shaban Aga, the Chief Customer, was seized and carried Pri∣soner to the middle Gate of the Seraglio, where Solyman the late Vizier was also com∣mitted, being taken at a House of his own on the Bosphorus; and the same day the Seg∣menbashee was also imprisoned, all which was performed by the special Command of the Grand Signior at the instigation of the Kuzlir Aga, whose Councils now solely pre∣vailed, and tended to the seizure of all per∣sons whatsoever of Office, and Riches, no matter why, or wherefore, provided they might be a Sacrifice acceptable to the Sol∣diery,
and attone for the Lives of his Master and himself. All these seizures and impri∣sonments of the great Officers caused such disturbances and fears amongst the Citizens at Constantinople, that they all shut up their Shops, a thousand Reports flying about the Town, of Dangers, and Enemies; and that the Grand Vizier with some Soldiers were come to the City with bad intentions and designs: Amidst all these Rumours, there were no Officers, or Governors; (they be∣ing all imprisoned) to appease, or comfort the People, until the Grand Signior created the Nisangi Pasha, (who puts the Grand Signior's Firm to publick Writings) to be Chimacam pro tempore, who came and published that there was no danger, and that every man should open his Shop upon pain of Death: And that Night the Grand Seignior went to the Grand Seraglio, where he had not Slept in Thirty Years before, having an aversion to the place, as we have shewn in other Books. And this was done for one Point of Reforma∣tion intended against the coming of the Army; for that it was one Article against this Sultan, that he had forsaken his Royal Palace, or Seraglio, the Glorious Seat of his An∣cestors. In this want of great and wise Officers, and Ministers,Kuperlee Pasha s sent for. the Kuzlir Aga, whose Coun∣cil was only heard, advised the Grand Sig∣nior to order and appoint Mustapha Pasha, Son of the Old Kuperlee, and Brother to the late Achmet Kupriogli, who then commanded at the Dardanelli to go to the Army, and endeavour to appease, and direct them; for which Employment he was esteemed the most proper person, being Brother-in-Law to Sciaus Pasha, who married his Sister, and one who stood well in the good Opinion and Esteem of the Soldiery: But upon farther Thoughts he was first commanded to come to Constantinople, there to receive his Or∣ders and Instructions. In a few days Kuperlee Mustapha came to Constantinople, and was treated and received by the Grand Seignior, with an unusual Re∣spect and Kindness;Is kindly received. October 1687. he called him Lala, which is a Compellation given by the Grand Signiors to their Great Vizier's, and signifies as much (as Father) telling him that as his Father setled him in his Throne, so now he was to Inherit that Honour, and confirm him thereon in despite of those powerful Machinations, which were forming against him; and to enable him thereunto, he created him Chimacam, Vested him, and what was very extraordinary, he caused him to Sup with him. That very Night, whilst the Grand Seignior was at the Table, the Se∣lictar Aga, or Sword-Bearer, who was sent with the Seal and Standard to Siaus Pasha, by which he was created Grand Vi∣zier, returned from the Army, which he met at Nissa; and reported, That whilst he was there,News from the Army. the Soldiers arose in a furious Tumult, and cut in pieces the Tefterdar, who was sent to appease them; and Ali Effendi, who the last year had been in the Treaty: But the Reis Effendi, who was sent on the same Errant, upon their first stirring fled, being too wise to trust their Mercy; as did also, a chief Commander of the Bostangees or Gar∣diners: But Ajemzadee a reverend Person of about Eighty years of Age, advising them not to spill the Blood of Musselmen, was pursued by them into the Vizier's Tent,Many Offi∣cers killed by them. who co∣vering him with his Vest endeavoured to save him; but finding the danger to which he exposed his own Life, he was forced to deliver him up to their Fury: He had been Reis Effendi or Chief Secretary, but then had an Office in the Treasury. They demand∣ed also the two Teskaragees, or Chief Clerks to the Reis Effendi, to be delivered up to their Justice; one of which had for many years done all the English business in that Office; but they desiring to be Strangled, rather than to have their Bodies mangled by the Soldiery, it was according∣ly performed behind the Vizier's Tent, and their Bodies exposed. Orta, Chiaus of the Janisaries (of whom we have already made mention) being suspected to have been corrupted by Regeb, the Chimacam of Constan∣tinople, was cut in pieces. Mustapha Pasha, who had been General of the Janisaries, and Seraskier in the first Siege of Buda, was se∣cured, and ran great danger of his Life; but by the Mediation of the Vizier, he was only deposed, and sent to command at the Dardanelli in the place of Mustapha Kuperlee, who was now Chimacam at Constantinople. And lastly, after this dismal Tragedy the Selictar coming to give an account of him∣self, he declared,The Seli∣ctar re∣turns from the Army. That he was fearful of his own Life, notwithstanding the good Of∣fice he had done in bringing the Seal and Standard to the Grand Vizier; for which whilst he was expecting a great Present, as was accustomary; an Answer was given, That the best Present could be given him was of his own Head, which had been taken off, according to the List in which he was proscri∣bed, but that he had merited his Life, by this Office of bringing the Seal and Standard. The Army having in this manner vented some part of their Fury at Nissa, proceed∣ed on their March towards Constantinople, doing little other harm on the Way,The Army Marches to Con∣stantino∣ple. than only displacing some few Officers of the Janisaries, and putting an old Granatine, who had been one of those, who had been banished by the Spaniards out of the King∣dom of Granada, a Person of Eighty years of Age, in the Office of General of the
Janisaries. As the Army approached, so the Fears and Apprehensions of the great Men at Constantinople increased. Mustapha Kupriogli, as we have said, being made Chi∣macam, he appeared publickly in the Divan, and gave out the Pay to the Soldiers; and then went to the Grand Seignior, whom he found at a Kiosk, or House of Pleasure by the Water side,A Council held. and presently a Consulta∣tion was held, at which were present the two Kadileskers, or chief Justices, the Na∣kib Effendi, who is chief of the Green-heads of the Prophet (or Mahomet's Kindred) four Sheghs or Preachers, the Stambol Effen∣di, or Mayor of the City, as also the Ni∣sangi Pasha, who sets the Firm of the Grand Seignior to Commissions; these after a Con∣sultation and Debate of about two hours time, resolved on several Points, not then divulged to the World but by the execution of them; for they all went together to the Chimacam's House, from whence in half an hours time afterwards, the Chiefs of the Chiauses, whith Thirty of his Men were sent to the Prison where Solyman the late Vi∣zier was confined; so soon as Solyman saw the Chiausbashee, he said, I know for what you come, God's will be done; the Chiaus∣bashee who had been his Creature, and rai∣sed by him,Solyman the late Vizier strangled. with Tears in his Eyes deli∣vered unto him the Command for his Head. Solyman taking it from him, kissed it and said, I have washed, but not as yet said my Kindi, or Afternoon Prayers, (for it was about that time) let me perform those my last Prayers, and then in the name of God execute your Office. Solyman having fini∣shed his Prayers, called the Chiausbashee into an Inner Room, and said, Execute your Orders; but first let me recommend two things to you. One is, That you declare and be a Witness to the World; That I have given Freedom to all my Slaves both Males and Females.His last Will. And 2ly, That they do not torment my People to find out my Money, for I never had any thing con∣siderable; the little I had was with me in the Camp, where it was lost, and made a Prey to the Enemy. In my House at Scu∣tari there is some Furniture, and some few Galanteries, which if the Grand Seignior will present to my Son it is well, but if not he is Lord and Master of them: And if you, said he, to the Chiausbashee, shall not de∣clare this to the Grand Seignior, my Hands shall be upon you at the Day of Judgment; And having said thus much he kneeled, and turning his Face to the Wall, the Exe∣cutioners performed their Duty. So was Solyman strangled, a Person deserving to live in better times, and worthy of a bet∣ter Death; his Head was cut off and carri∣ed to the Chimacam, where it was flead and stuffed with Cotton, and being put into a Box was sent to the Grand Seignior; but his Body was consigned to his Friends, and buried at Scutari. His Son a young Man of about 24 years of Age was sent for from Adrianople, and imprisoned to discover his Father's Estate; but that being known to be very little, the Chimacam by his own Au∣thority set him at liberty. The Wife of Solyman amidst her Fears, sent two Trunks filled with Sables, and rich Habits, and Vest∣ments to the House of a certain Friend to be there secured, and were accordingly co∣vered under a Pile of Wood: This matter being observed by a crew of Rogues, they came that Night, pretending an Order from the Chimacam to seize those Goods, naming the place where they were concealed; at which the People of the House being affright∣ed, immediately delivered the Trunks to the Hands of the Rogues: The next day the Wife of Solyman, full of sorrow and an∣guish of Mind, came to the Chimacam to make complaint of this hard Usage, decla∣ring the Goods to be her own, and not her Husband's. The Chimacam disavowing the matter, and denying to have given any such Orders, the Robbery appeared, and Search being made after the Thieves, four of them were taken and most of the Goods re∣stored. The next day Solyman's Head was sent for a Present to the Army, by two Officers belonging to the New Vizier, with a Letter from the Chimacam, accompanying an Im∣perial Command or Signature from the Sul∣tan, declaring, that if the Army would stay and Winter at Adrianople,Proposals sent to the Army; he would give them full satisfaction in sending the Heads of all they should demand, not sparing his own Sons or Brother, and would send them the Fifteen Months Pay that they were in Ar∣rear, with the same Donative as should have been given, in case a new Grand Seignior had been created. But they would hearken to no Conditions, for they had cast the Bri∣dle out of their Mouths, and taken the Power into their Hands;And refu∣sed. and nothing could now make them safe but a total Subversion of the Government, and a Change of the Grand Seignior. But first, The way thereunto was to be made by the Death of many of the great Men: Regeb Pasha, the late Chimacam,Regeb taken. was about this time taken at a place called Visa near Chattalgee in Asia, his Horse tired, and he almost famished with Hunger; and being brought to Constantinople he was committed Prisoner to the same Chamber, in which his Master Solyman had been late∣ly executed; and was in a few days after∣wards Strangled, as we shall see hereafter.
The same night that Regeb was imprison∣ed, the Kapugibashee, who was sent to Con∣duct the Mufti from Prusa to Rhodes, return∣ed with the Head of Ibrahim Pasha, who had been Vizier before Solyman; being put to Death by the contrivance of Regeb, as be-before mentioned.Ibrahim Pasha put to Death at Rhodes. The manner whereof was this: The Bey or Captain of the Gal∣ly, which carried the Mufti to Rhodes be∣ing a Friend to Ibrahim Pasha, endeavoured during the Voyage to pump the Capugi∣bashee to know of him, whether he had any other Orders to perform at Rhodes, besides that of conducting the Mufti; but he could discover nothing, so that so soon as he was arrived, he went directly to Ibrahim Pasha to put him out of pain, by assuring him, that there were no Orders come in relation unto him, and that their business was only to bring the Mufti. Whilst they were thus discoursing, a noise was heard in the Street and Ibrahim looking out of the Window, saw a multitude of People gathering about the Door, which the Bey said, might be out of curiosity to see the Mufti their new Guest. In a few minutes afterwards, in came the Capugibashee; and kissing Ibrahim's Vest sate down by him, and being asked what News, he said, all is well; and then dis∣coursing of general things, he drank his Coffee, and having smoaked his Pipe, he put his Hand into his Breast; and drew out a Paper, which he gave to his Hand; whilst he was reading of it, he shewed some alte∣ration in his Countenance, for he soon found that it concerned his Life: He had a little Child at that time playing upon his Knee, he kissed it with Tears in his Eyes, and bid his Servants take it away: And then said, What have I done? They have seized all my Estate, and not being contented therewith, they have sent for my Life. Oh treacherous World! Whilst he was saying thus much, the Capugibashee's Servants threw down the Cord on the Floar, which Ibrahim obser∣ving to be thick, and rugged, he took it up, saying, This is a Cord one would not strangle a Dog with, and bid his Man fetch him a Bow-string, which he soaped with the Soap, he intended to use at his washing before Prayers, and made a Knot to it him∣self: his Prayers being ended he was strang∣led; and his Head with his Women and Children were brought to Constantinople. The Chimacam had no mind to see it, for he had been his Friend, and had no Hand in his Blood, which lay wholly at Regeb's Door, who was now in a fair way of incur∣ring the same Fate himself: The Mony found about him was no more than Nine thou∣sand Dollars. It was now the Festival of their little Byram, when the Grand Seignior according to the usual Custom received the Salutes of the Chimacam and all the great Men,The little Byram. sit∣ting in his Kiosk, or House of pleasure by the Sea side, with Musick and firing of the Guns which lay at the point of the Serag∣lio. And now the Fate of the Grand Seignior seemed to approach; for the Army drew near, and had rejected all the fair Terms, and Propositions which the Sultan had offered them, and yet he still continued to make such Sacrifices to them as he thought might sweeten and appease them.The Army inflexible. But Turks were never used to be overcome by gentle Terms and soft Promises, but by the Topuz or Club, or by violent Remedies. For when the Head of Solyman late Vizier was brought, they said, it was not that which they look∣ed for, but rather to have had him alive under Examination, to know how he had disposed of the Money, which was given the last year to defray the Charges of the War: Howsoever, the Grand Seignior still resolved to try them yet farther by such Methods,The Grand Seignior still enda∣vours to appease them. which he thought might please them, and that was to Imprison, or put to Death all Men indifferently, that were in Office and Power, whether they had deser∣ved well or evil: Accordingly the Kuzlir Aga (chief of the black Eunuchs) and Bos∣tangibashee were imprisoned in the Seraglio, and others put into their places; and these two with Mahomet Effendi, Treasurer and Steward to the Empress, the Moxur Aga to Regeb Pasha, who was Grandson to the fa∣mous Bectas, who was Janisar Aga when the Kiosem Valide was cut off, Vanni Efen∣di Teskeragee or Giver of the Writs, Kapan Cheleli, who belonged to the Arsenal; Omar the Steward of Regeb late Chimacam, and Shafan Aga, who had been tormented to discover his Money, were all sent to the Army to receive such Sentence and Doom, as they should appoint for them: But as these were not demanded by the Soldiery, so some of them were rather preferr'd than punished by them. For the Moxur Aga was sent to command the Janisaries in Candia, the Bostangibashee and Segmen-bashee, were set at liberty, and the former sent Pasha to Mytilene, and the other to Command the Forces in the Morea against the Venetians; the others were held under Examination, be∣ing obliged to render an Account of the publick Monies, which had passed through their Hands;Fines laid and levi∣ed. but none of them was ac∣quitted without paying a Ransom. The Kuzlier Aga was fined at Three hundred Purses, besides his Goods and Furniture, which were very rich, he having Two hun∣dred Sable Vests, which were never made up, all which were seized, and he banished to Grand Cairo, the Asylum, or Receptacle of
unfortunate Eunuchs. The Grand Seignior finding himself now stript of all his faith∣ful and old Friends, which he had impru∣dently destroyed or faintly delivered up in∣to the Hands of his Enemies; began to grow desperate; and as such, resolved to play the last Game of Cowardize and Cruel∣ty, which was by the assistance of his Pages and Servants near his Person, to cut off his Sons and two Brothers; that so none remaining alive of the Ottoman Line, the Soldiers would be obliged to suffer him to Reign, and Propagate more of the Roy∣al Race. To execute this design with great∣er ease and security,The Grand Seignior endeavours to cut off his Bro∣thers and Sons. He sent to the Eu∣nuchs who kept his Brothers, telling them that he knowing his Condition to be such, that he could Reign no longer, he desired he might come and see them, and recom∣mend himself and Children to them, for that as he had been merciful to them, and not touched their Lives, so that they would prove kind and compassionate to him and his. This design could not be executed without entrusting it first to the Pages, who were to be Actors in the Tragedy; and they not being all faithful alike, some, or one of them made it known to the Chimacam, who immediately charged the New Kuzlir Aga, and Bostangibashee to set Guards at the Doors of the Brother's Apartments; be∣tween whom and the Pages there hapned some Scuffle: The new Janisar Aga had al∣so received Orders to attend with his Ja∣nisaries before the Gate of the Seraglio;Is preven∣ted. and matters being in this manner secured, the Chimacam went himself to the Grand Seignior, and admonished him not to pre∣cipitate, and engage himself in such a rash and odious Attempt, which the Jani∣saries, who were attending at the Gate would most certainly Revenge without any Regard, or Reverence to his Person. The Grand Seignior had been a little Rough be∣fore with the Chimacam; but the armed Force being near, so affrightned him, that he began to Treat the Chimacam with mil∣der Terms. Howsoever his Children were removed from the Seraglio, and the Guards doubled, which were set upon his Brothers. From that time the Grand Seignior lost all his Authority; for the Chimacam came no more near him,The Grand Seignior loses his Authority. and order'd the Bostangibashee not to suffer him to stir out of the Seraglio, so that all the Liberty and Divertisement he had, was to pass his time in a Kiosk, or House or Pleasure near the Sea. Howso∣ever, the Grand Seignior to make Trial of his Authority sent a Hattesheriff, or Royal Command to displace the Segmen∣bashee; but it proved of little effect, for the Chimacam received it, and said tis very well, but laid it by him, and that was all.

THE REIGN OF SOLYMAN, The Fourteenth Emperor of the Turks. BY this time the Army was come near to the City, the Vizier in Person as far as Ponte Grande, which is about Twenty English Miles distant from Constantinople:Oct. 28. 1687. And about ten a Clock that Night, the Janisar-Aga entred the City, with ten Chambers of Janisaries. And now did the hour fatal to Sultan Mahomet approach; for about two a Clock in the Morning of the 29th of October, the Bostangeebashi,Sultan Ma∣homet de∣posed. and the Kuzlir Aga by Order of the Army came to Sequester and confine him to his Chamber. He asked why, and what Hurt he had done? They told him, That he had Reigned Forty years, which was the Life of a Man, and might content himself with that, for that few of his An∣cestors had ruled so long. Then did the Chimacam, the Mufti, Nakib Effendi, who is principal of the Green-heads, or Mahomet's Kindred, with the Kadeleskers or Chief Justices, with the Chief Men of the Law meet together, and held a Council before Day at St. Sophia. This Nakib Effendi had been a Kadelesker, but a few Days before; for the former Nakib died of a Fright, taken at the appearance of some Janisaries before his Door, which he apprehended came to seize him. After they had ended their morning Prayer about break of Day, they went together from the Mosch to the Serag∣lio, and entring in, they asked for Sultan Solyman, who was brought out to them; and then the Nakib Effendi, whose Office it was, as being the Head of the Race of the Prophet, placed him in the Throne, and prayed that he might be prosperous,Sultan So∣lyman made Em∣peror. and in∣crease the Honour of the Empire, and kissed his Hand, as did also the Mufti, the Chima∣cam and the others. The Sultan laying his Hand on his Breast bowed and thanked them; after which Ceremony they all re∣tired, and afterwards about nine a Clock Proclamation was made in the Streets, That Sultan Mahomet being deposed for his ill Government, Sultan Solyman is made Em∣peror in his place. The next Day being the last Day of October, the Chimacam, the Chiausbashee,  and other great Men went to meet the Grand Vizier at Daout Passa, a place distant about two English Miles from Constantinople; but the Chiausbashee was arrested, not that the Soldiers had any thing against him, but on∣ly that they might make room for him, who officiated in that charge in the Army. The first of November the Grand Vizier made his Entrance into the City with a Solemn Cavalcade,  accompanied by all the great Men of the Empire both Civil and Mi∣litary: The Mufti riding on his Left-hand,Siaus Pasha Grand Vi∣zier makes his Entry and lutes the Grand Seignior. he went to the Seraglio, where he alighted, and taking the Standard of the Prophet, he went with it to the Grand Seignior, who arising from his Throne went three Steps to meet it, and took it from the Vizier, and gave it to the Selictar; then the Vizier gave him up the Seal also, which being with his Bro∣ther's Name, he kept, and returned him a new one, with his own Name. The Solem∣nity being over, the Vizer went to a great Palace lately Ibrahim Pasha's, near the Jani∣saries Chamber, which was provided for him; and the Chimacam Kupriogli remained in that where his Brother and other Viziers had formerly resided. And now it might have been thought, that all Seditions and Mutinies amongst the Soldiery would have ended at this Period But it seems the Storm was not half over;
for it remained, that the Authours of these Troubles who had been guilty of so much Blood, and death of their Officers, should at length turn their Fury against each others; and so it happened: For the Spahees meeting at Atmeidan or the Hypodromo, and the Ja∣nisaries at Etmeidan, demanded their Pay, and that Regeb Pasha, should be delivered to their Hands. The next Day being the 4th af November,Nov. 1687. Regeb strangled. Regeb Pasha was strangled, and his Body exposed before the Seraglio in the Square of Santa Sophia, and laid on an old Matt for three Days: It is believed, that thô the demand of his Life proceeded from the Soldiery, yet that it was a con∣trivance of the Vizier, not only in Revenge for procuring the Command sent to the late Solyman for his Head; but out of fear of his Person, who was known to be a Subtle, and a stout Man. The same Day Cochiuck or little Mahomet, a Pestilent Fellow, and chief Head of the Mutinous Spahees, with seven other Ringleaders in all the Seditions, was lodged in the great Palace of the Hypo∣dromo; and when he went abroad was al∣ways attended with a numerous armed Guard, whether out of State, or Fear, is not well known; having a confidence in him∣self, and his Merits and good Services he had done for the Soldiery, adventured to perswade them to a quiet, and an orderly be∣haviour, and to content themselves for the present with three Pays, and to have a lit∣tle patience for the rest, and for their Do∣native, until Money could be raised: This admonition sounding not well in the Ears of some Soldiers, they presently instilled into the Minds of their Comrades, that this Mahomet had been taken off with Mony, and was brought into the Association with those, whose business it was to defraud them of their just Demands: Such a sinister Re∣port as this, was enough at that time to have destroyed half their Officers; as it quickly did his business; for immediately they ran to his Palace to look for him there, but missing him, they afterwards met him in the Streets, and pulled him from his Horse, saying, You that brought us hither, and should Speak for us, now look to your self; you Lie in a Palace, Eat High, and are clad in Sables, whilst we poor Fellows are Ragged,The chief of the Mu∣tineers kil∣led. and Lie in the Yards of the Moschs, and Corners of the Streets; and with that they rushed upon him, and with Clubs and Knives killed him, and Toar his Body in Pieces. This was the busiest Man of any, feared by all, thô an ordinary Spa∣hee; he was presented and courted by all the great Men in Town; for no Man was secure of his Head, if he would have instigated, and moved the Soldiers to call for it: Having thus dispatched him, they ran to his Palace, and plunder'd all he had there. The Kuzlir-Aga, who had escaped, was pursued and taken at Nice, and brought back and committed Prisoner to the seven Towers;Several Imprisoned. then was Mahomet Effendi Tefter∣dar or Treasurer, Shaban Aga, Omar Kiah, Capan Chelebi, and several others, were sent to the Common Prison: But Kupriogli was declared Mosayp, or Favourite of the Grand Seignior. All the care was now to pacifie the Sol∣diers, which was only to be done with Money; and the Art was, how to separate and divide the Spahees; as a means where∣unto they began to give pay to the Janisa∣ries, and to serve them first: This had like∣ly to have begotten ill Blood; but the Spahees put them in mind of the solemn Oath, they had made to stand by each other; and the Janisaries refused their Pay, without the increase both of their Pay and Donative;The Spa∣hees and Janisaries unite. but there being not as yet a sufficient Fund for all, the Tumults still continued. This Artifice which was contrived for a Separa∣tion, tied the Knot of Union more closely between the Janisaries and Spahees, so that many Spahees came as Guests to the Janisaries Chambers, and lodged with them, declaring that they would not touch an As∣per of their Pay, until the Janisaries were fully satisfied. This Friendship being made between these two Military Orders; the Spahees as the more polite and ingenious Men took all the Government into their own Hands, holding their Councils at Atmeidan, and what was there resolved, was reported to the Vizier by four of their own Mem∣bers, and the Vizier being forced to assent unto all their Demands,The Vizier yields to all their demands. gave them a Wri∣ting to approve of all that they should do, and liberty to use such Methods for raising Money, as they should judge most conve∣nient in this exigence, both to satisfie the Donative, and the Arrears and Increase of Pay. Notwithstanding all these Condescenti∣ons, and thô the means were put into their Hands to pay themselves what they demand∣ed, yet the Troubles and Embroils still conti∣nued: For the Janisaries suspecting that their Aga or Commander in Chief was not cordial to them, nor approving their Actions (for every one was thought so, who did not run to the same heigth of Madness with them) they turned him out of his Office, and would have none of their own Body to command them, but one, as in former times, taken out of the Seraglio; and such an one they pitch∣ed upon, called Mustapha Aga, a Chirur∣gion by profession,The Jani∣saries chuse a new Aga. who had been Twenty five years in the Seraglio, of which he had been eight Tulbentgee or Turbant-folder to
the late Grand Seignior, and Selictar to the present Sultan; the true cause of this change was, that they would have a raw unpra∣ctised Fellow over them, and one whom they could govern, and not one, who knew how to govern them. The Tumults still continued, and must so until Money could be found, which the Soldiers were now themselves to raise; every Man that had Money must now bleed his Coffers, and redeem his Life with his Riches.The man∣ner of rai∣sing Money. The Favourits of the Se∣raglio must pay their Shares, being taxed at vast Sums, the particulars of which were not exactly known; but it was reported, That the Selictar Aga to the late Grand Seig∣nior, now made Pasha of Grand Cairo, paid Six hundred Purses; the Chiohadar, or he who is Master of the Wardrobe, Two hun∣dred; the Pasha of Balsora, Two hundred; besides many others, who all paid their Assesments, as the Soldiers were pleased to Rate and Tax them. Then the Chief of the Spahees called be∣fore them several of the Rich men of the City, and Taxed them each according to what they believed them worth; and sent an Officer, with a certain Number of Soldiers, to go with them to their respective Houses, and stay with them until the Money was paid,Rich Men taxed. and then they carried it to the Trea∣surer, taking his Receipt for the same. The Stambol Agasee, or Mayor of Constantinople, was Fined Five hundred Purses, the Shahir Emin, or City Customer Forty, Sari Osman Aga Thirty, besides Ninety which the Ex∣chequer owed him, which he was to remit. Likewise the Grand Signior's chief Physi∣cians, Astrologers and Goldsmiths, and great Numbers more of all sorts and conditions, were all Taxed, and most of them to the full of what they were worth. Thus were vast Sums raised by Military Execution, with which the Grand Vizier was well enough pleased; for the Soldiers had done his busi∣ness for him, without drawing an Odium upon himself; for there being a scarcity, and yet an absolute necessity for Money, it could not be raised by more compendious Methods,The Jani∣saries As∣sault their Officers. than by armed Force. And yet for all this the Tumults continued; for the Janisaries not knowing what they would have, assaulted their Officers at Evening Prayer, in a Mosch near their Chambers; saying, That they were met there in Coun∣cil against them, with design to instill bad Principles into their new Janisar Aga; but no hurt was more done than a few Blows, and an abundance of bad Words. Nov. 1687. The vouch¦safe to take their pay.And now about the middle of this Month, after many Complements and Courtships made to the Janisaries, they condescended at length to take their Pay and Donative, which were so kindly offered; and those, who had been imprisoned upon paying their Ransom were set at Liberty. Mahomet Effendi, who had been Treasurer, paid One hundred and twenty Purses; Shaban Aga One hundred and fifty, besides Four hun∣dred which had formerly been racked from him by Torments; Capan Chelebi Sixty, Omar Kiak Thirty five, besides what had been taken from him before: Mustapha Aga the Chiausbashee Forty, and Uziel a Jew was made to pay eight Purses; and thus suffici∣ent Money being found for payment of all, and the same daily issuing, all things grew calm and quiet; so that on the 17th about eight a Clock in the Morning,The new Grand Seignior installed. the new Grand Seignior went by Boat from the Se∣raglio to Eiub, where the Nakib Effendi, or Chief of Mahomet's Kindred Girt him with the Sword, which is a Ceremony answering to our Coronation; and having said Noon-Prayers at that place, and all the Ceremo∣nies ended, he rode from the Mosch in a Solemn Cavalcade through the City back to the Seraglio, but not with such Splendor and Magnificence, as had been done in the time of the Grand Seigniors his Predecessors: All People crouded (as we may believe) to see the Features and Fashion of their new Sultan, of whose Person and Abilities Re∣ports had created already a high Expecta∣tion. He was of a long, lean, pale Visage, but not of an ungrateful Aspect;His person and quali∣ties. his Eyes were full and black, and his Beard was black, but somewhat grisly; what his Qua∣lications of Mind were, will be more evi∣dently discovered hereafter, and come then more properly to be described in their due place. But in the mean time we may re∣flect, that the change of the person of the Prince, could not be of much advantage to the Publick: For what the other did out of a remiss and voluptuous Humour, attending only to his Divertisements, and leaving the Care and Management of all his Affairs to the Contrivance and Conduct of his Mini∣sters; this Grand Seignior must now do out of necessity, being wholly unexperien∣ced in the World, having all his Life been kept up in a Chamber, without other Con∣versation, than that of a few Eunuchs, some old Women, and two or three Hogiaes, or Masters to assist him in his Studies. As Books were his Entertainment in his con∣fined Life, so he seemed to have had an affection for them, in the choice he made of Kupriogli for his Favourite, who was e∣steemed in that Country a learned Man, and to have had the best Library of any in that whole Empire. It was said, That he had promised his deposed Brother all security of his Life, and that he should be kept in the same manner, as he was; and that he might
allow him what comfort he could in that manner of Life, he suffered his Children to be with him for some Days; but they were afterwards by the Councils of others taken from him and lodged apart.He visits his Brother Achment. His other Bro∣ther Achmet, the Companion with him in his Imprisonment, he visited, and promised to be kind to him; but he was not perfect Master of his Senses; of which we shall speak more when we come to see him on the Throne after the Death of Sultan Solyman. The Hazaki Sultana, or Empress of the deposed Sultan, was sent to the old Seraglio there to remain until Death, or some other Revolution of Fortune shall release her: In the place of her, the Mother of the pre∣sent Grand Seignior, who for some years was reported to be dead, appeared alive, and removed from the old Seraglio to her Son, but she was a little Maddish. Thus were all things turned up-side down; all the great Officers of the Empire, except the Captain Pasha or Admiral, being changed:Reflections on the changes. Which when a Man seriously con∣siders, and that these Revolutions were car∣ried on by common Soldiers, one would ad∣mire that they should pass with so little Confusion, or Blood-shed: For except those six which were killed in the Army, and Cuchiuck Mahomet at Constantinople in a Mi∣litary Fury, there was only Solyman and Re∣geb cut off; for the Death of Ibrahim at Rhodes, did not proceed from them, but from Regeb. As to the daily Insolences in the Streets, they were not committed by the Spahees, but by poor Drunken Janisaries, who had neither Money nor Cloths, and therewith would be supplied from Christi∣ans, and Jews, and Turks too. But this was no new thing, but what had been formerly practised by the baser sort of the Soldiers, as often as they came from the War, or were shortly going thither. And now since things were thus changed, some Reforma∣tion was expected, and that was to begin in the Seraglio; where the first and most plau∣sible thing was the Retrenchment of the Ex∣pences,Reforma∣tions in the Govern∣ment. which during the time of the late Sultan had been excessive, the very Barly for the Horses costing One thousand five hundred Dollars, or Three hundred pounds Sterling a Day; the number of the Hawks and Dogs, with the People who attended them was vast, all which were ordered to be reduced; for the present Sultan took so little delight in these Divertisements, that he was to learn how to Ride; and the Sta∣bles were to be reduced to a Hundred Horse, one Hundred and fifty of the Pages were to be made Spahees, and the rest were to be changed, and new ones put into their places. The same was to be performed in the Courts and Chambers of the Women; so that the Retrenchments made were cal∣culated to amount unto Eight thousand Pur∣ses of Money a year, every Purse being Five hundred Dollars, and may be account∣ed to be almost a Million of pounds Ster∣ling: The Greyhounds and Dogs, of which there were many Hundreds kept in the Se∣raglio for the use of the late Sultan, were all let loose and suffered to run about the Streets of Constantinople, where they might have starved, had not the godly Men, whose Religion consists much in feeding Dogs and Cats, taken Compassion on them, and fed them daily with Bread from the Ba∣kers Shops. These Retrenchments of expence in the Seraglio pleased the Soldiers wonderfully,Decem. 1687. hoping that thereby the more Money would be coming to them; and so they continued very observant and quiet, during all the time that the Money was paying out; but so soon as that began to fail and fall short,New Com∣motions. they became as troublesome as ever, assem∣bling with great Insolence at the Vizier's House, threw Stones at his Windows, storm∣ing and raging like Mad-men, until such time as with fair words, and promises of Money within a few Days they were for a while appeased. Thus far had the Soldiery found the ways to raise Money; but now they being at a stand, it was the Vizier's turn to set on foot some new invention, or conjuration for more: But so empty and drained were all the great Banks,Money wan¦ting, but it found. that no other way could be thought on, but only to go over the rich Men once more, and to squeeze them to the last Dreggs of all their Estates; to perform which they began with the old Kuzlir Aga, who obtained his Liberty upon payment of Nine hundred Purses, in all, be∣sides his Furniture, and Curiosities which were taken from him to a great value; and after that he had the favour to be Banisht to Grand Cairo: The Hasnadar Aga, who (as we have said) succeeded him, was displaced, and paid Two hundred Purses; and the Aga of the old Seraglio was made Kuzlir Aga; which Promotion was according to the anci∣ent Methods, that every one should rise and succeed gradually, and savoured some∣thing of a Reformation. But because this new Tax would not reach the entire Sum required for the Soldiers Pay and Donative; they were forced to Coin out of Plate, and Silver and Gold taken off from the Horses Furniture belonging to the Seraglio Two hundred Purses in Gold, and Sixty in Sil∣ver; with which every one being satisfied,The Spa∣hees re∣turn home. all was quiet and calm again, and the Spa∣hees returned to their own Homes; leaving six of the Chief Mutiniers to remain behind at Constantinople. That is to say, one Chief,
with two Assistants for the white Colours, and the like for the red; and Four hundred Captains called Bolucbashees, Two hundred for each Colour or Ensign; and these were appointed to hold the power in their Hands, which their Mutinies, and late Rebellions had gained for them. About this time, the Turks proposed at the instigation of the French Ambassador; to send a Chiaus into France, England and Holland, to acquaint those Princes with the advancement of Sultan Solyman to the Throne of the Ottoman Emperors. The which Embassy, thô little desired by the other Ministers, being a Complement insig∣nificant in it self, and which would only cost Money and Trouble, was yet much pressed by the French,The French desire to engage the Turks to them. who were then con∣triving to do something extraordinary to en∣gage the Turk in a strict Alliance with them, being at that time resolved to disoblige, and enter into a War against the Emperor, and all the Princes of Germany. But by Trou∣bles afterwards amongst the Turks them∣selves, and by the revived Spirits of Muti∣ny amongst the Soldiery, their thoughts were so taken up with their Seditions, For∣reign Enemies and other Misfortunes, that they thought it not so seasonable to send such triumphant Messages in the declension of their Affairs, as might have been in more happy and prosperous times. Howsoever the French Ambassador and Merchants at Constantinople, to evidence their good Affe∣ction to the Port, freely supplied the late Selictar Aga, now appointed Pasha of Grand Cairo, with two Ships to Transport him and his Equipage to Alexandria; and farther to oblige him, lent him in Money and Goods to the value of One hundred and fifty Pur∣ses; for security of which, Pawns were given to remain aboard, until the Debt was sa∣tisfied. And now the Grand Vizier began to ap∣pear in publick with the usual Pomp and E∣quipage; he made his Visit with great State to the Mufti; and daily held the Divans in the Seraglio, besides those at his own House. The Vizier appears in publick.The new Sultan had been so little a while in the Government, that he could not as yet give many Indications of his Temper; but as to what appeared of him at first, he seem∣ed very devout, a strict observer of his Law, and much addicted to reading,The Cha∣recter of the new Grand Seignior. so that he could not shake off his habitual retiredness, nor enjoy the pleasures of a Court, and of such a Throne as anciently cast off all the Cares of it, on the Vizier and other Mini∣sters; for he neither conversed with Women, nor took any publick Diversion. In the mean time his deposed Brother Sultan Ma∣homet, who had always used much Exercise, began by an unaccustomed Confinement to be tainted with the Scurvy; his Legs swel∣led, and gave Symptoms of the Dropsy. Wherefore he sent to his Brother the present Sultan, desiring that some Physitians might be permitted to come to him for his Cure. But grave Solyman returned him answer, That in case he should allow that, and he miscarry, the World would say, that he was an occasion of his Death; so that in lieu of the Physitians he would pray to God for him, and he who sent the Sickness could give him a Cure. These civil Commotions and Mutinies amongst the Soldiers were more dangerous to the Ottoman State, than all the Ruins, Defeats and Losses they had received from the Enemy; and gave the Imperialists an opportunity to act, and succeed in all their Enterprizes in Hungary, and march and rove with their Parties through the whole Coun∣try without opposition or controule: But the Season of the year being too much ad∣vanced,The Chri∣stian Army draws into Winter-quarters. it was thought time to draw the Armies into Winter-quarters, and to lodge them in the conquered Countries. Thus Count Dunewalt after he had fortified and secured the Castles, and Places which he had taken, quartered his Army at Possega, Valkovar, and other places bordering upon Croatia. Likewise the two Regiments of Palfy and Staremberg, which had lately been detached from the Duke of Lorain's Army, to attend the Emperor's service at Possonium, on occasion of the Coronation of Joseph King of the Romans, joyned with some other Hungarian Troops near Buda, attacked in their way thither the Fortresses of Ciocca and Palotta, and took them; by which the Garrison of Alba Regalis was much streight∣ned, and disabled from making Incursions so far as the Danube. The Duke of Loraine marching (as we have said) towards Transilvania, resolved to take Quarters for his Army in that fruitful Principality, as yet not much wasted with the War; and the better to prepare them,Quarters taen in Transilva∣nia. dispatched away the Baron Huntschin with full Commission to Prince Apafi to Treat a∣bout the places, which might be assigned with most convenience for the Soldiery, and ease to the People. Huntschin speedily returned with advice, that he had been fa∣vourably received by Apafi, who having assembled several of his Boyars, or Noble∣men together,Apafi s nds De∣puties to the Duke of Loraine. had resolved to send Deputies to the Duke of Loraine, giving him to un∣derstand, the great joy and satisfaction they had received by the happy Successes of the Imperial Arms, by which they flattered themselves so far, as to believe that they should now be freed from the Tyranny and oppression of the Ottoman Yoak, and that
as a Testimony thereof, they had readily consented to afford all the succour and subsi∣stence they were able to the maintenance of the Christian Troops, during the whole Winter season. But as to assign them places for Quarters within the Principality of Transilvania, they instantly desired to be ac∣quitted; in regard that such a Concession would greatly offend the Port, and lay them open to the Incursions, and to the Fire and Sword both of the Turks and Tartars. To this Message the Duke of Loraine made Answer in obliging, but yet in general Terms; and in the mean time the Army still advanced without farther Treaty, it being well known that neither the Turkish Troops, nor those of the Country were in a capacity to Dis∣pute their Passage; so that on the 11th of October,  the Army arrived at Salone, the first Town of Transilvania, where after having without many questions or complements, put a Garrison of about a Hundred Men into the place,Offers made. they marched forward towards Clau∣sembourg: But on their way thither, the Duke of Loraine was met by three Deputies from the Prince and States, who repeated the same Offers, which had been related by Baron Huntschin touching the Ammunition and Provisions, with which they would furnish the Troops; to which they added also an offer of some Money; but as to as∣signing places for Winter-quarters, it was a matter impossible, and of the most danger∣ous consequence to them in the World; since that their Country lying open, and without defence, would thereby be exposed to all the Hostilities, which the most bar∣barous and cruel Enemy in the World could execute. The Duke of Loraine finding that the Commission of these Deputies extended no farther, than what they had declared; returned them back again with Count Scherf∣femberg and Baron Falkenhem, who were or∣ordered to let Prince Apafi know,A Message from Lo∣raine. that since he had refused to assign him Winter-quar∣ters on fair Terms, he himself should be con∣strained to point them out unto his Troops, and continue his March into the Bowels of his Country. The States of the Principality perceiving the Duke of Loraine to be in earnest, and resolved to obtain his De∣mands; were contented to grant him Quar∣ters for a certain number, but that not suffi∣sing, he continued his March towards Clau∣sembourg or Claudiopolis, the chief City of that Country, and the place where the States of Transilvania did usually Assemble. It is situate in a very fruitful Plain upon the little River of Samos; it is encompassed with very thick Walls, and the Houses are very well Built;Claudio∣polis. it is defended by an ancient For∣tress; the Suburbs are so large and well peopled, that it seems to be another Town; the Inhabitants are both Hungarians and Saxons, who live in so good unity and corre∣spondence together, that both are equally capable of Offices and Places of Trust in the Government. The Duke of Loraine so soon as he appeared before the Place, sent to the Governour to provide Quarters in the Town for some of his Troops; but he ex∣cusing it, and saying, that he could not do it without Orders from Prince Apafi, imme∣diately Count Caprara was sent to let him know, that his Answer was not satisfactory, and that Orders were given to the Infantry to prepare all things necessary for making an Attack on the Town. Whereupon the Governour considering better of the matter,The Condi∣tions with Claudio∣polis. enter'd into a Treaty with the Duke of Loraine, who condescended to grant unto the Inhabitants these following Conditi∣ons. That the Inhabitants should enjoy a free Exercise of their Religion. That the Magistrates and Citizens should be maintained in their Liberties and Privi∣ledges, and not be forced to pay any extraor∣dinary Contributions. That every Officer or Magistrate of the City, should be exempt from giving Quarters to any Soldier in his own House. That what Forage and Subsistence should be necessary for the Soldiery should be furnished in Specie, and no Money exacted in lieu of the same: And that the Soldiers be forbidden under severe Penalties to commit any Disor∣ders, or Abuse the People. That those Citizens who were unwilling to continue their Aboad in the City, but were desirous to depart, might have Liberty so to do, and carry with them all their Goods and Move∣ables. According to these Conditions the Gar∣rison of Apafi, marched out at one Gate, whilst Three thousand of the Imperialists enter'd in at the other with Drums beating and Colours flying; and the Command of the Town was given to Count Guy de Sta∣remberg, whith a strict Charge to punish most severely all Insolences of the Soldiers; the which was carefully observed, not only in that City, but also in all parts of Transil∣vania since their entrance into it. The Duke of Loraine having for one day refreshed the rest of his Army in places with∣out the Town,The Duke of Loraine at Alba Julia. marched towards Turtem∣bourg, which is another important Pass in that Country, in which having left a Garri∣son, he proceeded to Weissembourg, other∣wise called Alba Julia, so named from the Empress Julia, Mother of Marcus Aurelius, and entred into it without any resistance. The place is situate on the side of a Hill, from
whence a vast Plain discovers it self; it is reported to have been the ultimate Limit of the Roman Conquests on that side. Prince Ragotzki erected an University there, which was very flourishing and famous, consider∣ing the Country. Hermanstadt, alias Zeben, followed the Example of the aforesaid places: It is the Metropolis of the whole Province of Sa∣vons,Zeben. situate in a Plain full of Boggs and Marshes, and no Hills near to command it; the Walls are very thick, and flanked with very great Bastions. Bestrissa, and all the other considerable Towns opened in like manner their Gates; so that now the whole Army being conve∣niently Quartered,And Be∣strissa sur∣render. the Duke of Loraine en∣tred into a Treaty with Prince Apafi, and the States of Transilvania, and concluded on these following Articles.Articles agreed. I. That the Prince of Transilvania, his Children, and all persons of his Houshold, as also, all the Nobles, and in General, all the People of Transilvania may have liberty ac∣cording to their Will and Pleasure to go out of Hermanstadt, or any other City or Town, and return again, as shall be most agreeable and expedient to or for their Affairs. II. That the Prince, and Michael Apafi, his Eldest Son, who is declared Successor to his Father, shall both retain the same Power and Dignity with which the Sultan had in∣vested them, and that the Principality should be governed by them, and the Estates accord∣ing to the known Laws and Customs of that Country. III. That the Four Religions allowed in Transilvania, that is to say, the Roman Ca∣tholicks, the Lutherans, the Calvinists, and the Unitarians, or Socinians, shall be per∣mitted to exercise the Rites of their respective Religions, and to have Liberty of Conscience equally indulged to them. IV. That it shall not be permitted, on any pretence whatsoever, to molest the Priests, or the Ministers of any of the aforesaid Religi∣ons in the due exercise of their respective Rites and Ceremonies, nor disturb their Schools, or Colleges, the which with all freedom and liberty shall be allowed, and permitted, and defended by the Authority and Power of the Emperor. V. That the Transilvanians shall be sup∣ported, and maintained in their Civil Privi∣leges, and Franchises. VI. In case any Foreign Power shall invade, and attack the Country of Transilvania, the Imperialists shall use all their power to drive them thence and defend the Country: And the Transilvanians shall to that end enter into a defensive alliance with them; the which shall by both Parties be confirmed upon Oath. VII. The Imperial Troops which have their Winter-Quarters in Cities, Towns, or Villa∣ges, shall remain no longer therein, than un∣til the Spring; when they shall be obliged to draw out of those Quarters into the Field, that so they may be no longer a charge unto the several Cities and Countries. VIII. That in case the Weather and Season should be such, or some other cause intervene, that the Imperialists cannot conveniently draw out into the Field at the beginning of the Spring; there shall be an Article expresly formed for this case; that so an amicable un∣derstanding may be continued between the Em∣peror and Prince Apafi. IX. That a General Act of Amnesty, or Ob∣livion shall pass of all Outrages and Hostilities which have been committed on one side or the other, wherein all Strangers and Deserters shall be included. X. That the Burghers and Citizens shall be continued in their Privileges of guarding the Gates, and the Keys of the City shall be committed to the hands of the Saxon Consuls; the which Gates notwithstanding are to be shut and opened at all times when the Imperial Go∣vernor shall command. These Articles being agreed, and conclu∣ded between the Duke of Loraine, and the Prince and Estates of Transilvania, and af∣terwards ratified by the Emperor, the Troops marched into their Winter-Quarters; and it was hoped, that Moldavia, and Walachia being Neighbouring Provinces, would fol∣low the Example of the more powerful Principality. This Year's Campaigne being thus glo∣riously ended, to the great and lasting Ho∣nour of the Emperor, and to the Welfare and Safety of the Empire, and of all Germany, and as we may justly say of all Christendom;The Impe∣rial Court goes to Possonium. The Emperor, the Empress, the Arch-Duke, and the Arch-Duchess Elizabeth his Sister on the 26th of October left Vienna, attended only with their ordinary Guards and Mini∣sters, and Officers of their Court, and be∣gan their Journey towards Possonium, at which place against this time, circular Let∣ters had been sent to convene a General Diet of the Nobles and States of Hun∣gary. This August Family were met on their way near that City by Two thousand of the
Hungarian Nobility, all well mounted, with a splendid Equipage in the Plains of Chitzé, not far from Possonium; as also by two Imperial Regiments, which attended their Majesties to the Gates of the City, where the Recor∣der met them; and having Complimented their Majesties with a most florid Oration, offered the Keys of the City to the Empe∣ror, in the Name of the People, who with loud Acclamations, and firing all the Cannon on the Walls, testified the Joy they concei∣ved for the appearance of the most August and Illustrious Family. The day following, after the Mass was Celebrated,Crown of Hungary setled. the Assembly of the States of Hungary were convened, where after divers Points were debated, all Difficulties were overcome, and agreed to the common satis∣faction, and with the general consent, That the Hereditary Succession of that Kingdom should descend to the Eldest Son of his Cesarean Ma∣jesty, and from him to all those who shall spring, or be derived from him; and for de∣fault of Issue, in case that Line should come to fail, (which God forbid) then the Crown should descend unto the Family of the King of Spain. The day appointed for the Coronation be∣ing come, the Emperor and Empress, at∣tended with a Noble and an Illustrious Train came to the Temple of St. Martin,The Cere∣monies of Crowning the King of Hungary. where the Ceremony was to be performed, and at the Gate thereof were met by the Archbishop of Strigonium, Primate of that Kingdom, assisted by all the Bishops, who were Twelve in Number, besides Fourteen Priors, and Abbots, clothed in their Pon∣tifical and Canonical Habits, who with the Sound of all sorts of Musical Instruments, conducted their Imperial Majesties, habited in their sacred Garments, wearing their Crowns, attended with a most pompous Train, and with all the Signals of Empire unto the Altar, and there seated them on their Thrones. After which the Bishops and other Prelates returned to receive the new King; before whom first marched the Heralds of the King∣dom of Hungary in their Coats: After them followed the Guards, next went the Lacquies and Pages, all clothed in new Liveries; these were followed by the Bishops and Chief Officers of that Kingdom, with Ten Hun∣garian Knights, each carrying a Standard in his hand, representing the Ten Kingdoms anciently appertaining to the vast Dominion of Hungary. After all which came the King clothed in the Hungarian Habit accompanied with Prince Esterhasy the Palatine, and the Counts Stephen Ciaky, Lord Chief Justice Nicholas Erdeody Ban or Prince of the Kingdom of Croatia, John Drascoviz, Steward of the Royal Houshold, and Adam Zrini, Marshal of the Kingdom; the King himself being between Two Bishops, was conducted to the Throne prepared for him, not far from the High Altar, at which Mass was Cele∣brated by the Archbishop of Strigonium, Lord Primate of Hungary; the which be∣ing ended, all the Nobility did Homage to the King; who having made profession of his Faith before the Altar, he was Blessed and Consecrated by the Archbishop, and Anoint∣ed in the Palm of his Right-hand, on his Arm, and Shoulders; and then the Pala∣tine holding up the Crown in his hand, asked them with a loud Voice, saying, Co∣ronabimus Josephum Archiducem Austriae in Regem Hungariae? which is, Shall we Crown Joseph Arch-Duke of Austria King of the Romans? which being done Three times, and answer made as often Coronetur, or let him be Crowned; the Crown was delivered by the Palatine to the Archbishop, who set it on his Head, and was clothed by him with the Royal Mantle of St. Stephen: Then was the Sword delivered to one Hand, and the Scepter to the other; and thus being adorned with all the Ensigns of Majesty, he was Proclaim∣ed King with the sound of Drums, Trum∣pets, Acclamations of the People, and all sorts of Musick, the Cannon being at the same time Fired round the Walls, and in the Fortresses. Then was the King conducted again to his Throne, and Te Deum sung: In the mean time the Mass was continued by the Archbishop, who being come to the Go∣spel, the Emperor himself arose, and taking the Scepter in his Right Hand, and the Globe in his Left, he held the same in that manner, until the Gospel was ended, and then the Young King received the Sacrament. All the Ceremonies being ended, the King descended from his Throne, and walked in Procession, habited in his Royal Garments, the Bishops, and all the Orders of State marching before him, to the Church of the Franciscans discalced, all the Streets being hung with White, and Red, and Green Cloth, and crouded with an infinite Num∣ber of Spectators. Being come into the Monastery, several Ceremonies were perform∣ed, and the King having conferred the Honour of Knighthood on divers Gentlemen, he was entertained with a Dinner, and some Refresh∣ments, after the Solemnities of Four hours, in the Refectory of the Convent. After which the King mounted on Horse-back, and being attended with a Noble Cavalcade of most of the Nobility of the Kingdom, and al∣ways accompanied by the Prince of Salm, his Tutor, under Title of Lord High Steward of his Houshold; he was conducted through the Gate of St. Michael, to a Theatre erect∣ed against the Monastery called the Brothers
of Mercy, on which the King ascended; and being Seated under a Canopy, all the Guns from the Walls of the City and Fortresses were Fired; and then the King in the face of all the People, took an Oath to conserve all the Privileges of that Kingdom, as lately agreed by the Estates in several particulars. After which the Palatine turning to the Peo∣ple, cried with a loud Voice, Vivat Rex Hungariae. Then the King descended, and went in like manner as before, to another Theatre raised on a little Hill near the Fish∣gate; where unsheathing his Sword, he therewith made Four Crosses towards the Four Quarters of the World, as a Signal that therewith he would Fight against all the Enemies of that Kingdom, and of the most August House of Austria. After which the King descended, followed by the Lord High Chamberlain of the Mountain Cities; and Baron Viechter, of the Emperor's Privy-Council, who scattered Money amongst the People; and being entred within the Castle, all the Canon were Fired; and the King dis∣mounting from his Horse, was attended to the Emperor's Apartments with a splendid Train of the Nobility and Gentry; and be∣ing thence conducted to the Imperial Hall, he was entertained there with incomparable Musick both Vocal and Instrumental, and with a Sumptuous and Royal Banquet; where also all the Prelates, Grandees, and Strangers were treated at Eighty several Magnificent Tables: After which the Solemnities and Triumphs of the day were ended with great Joy, Honour, and Satisfaction. And now in this place it is worthy our Observation, that whilst the Germans were employed in the Exaltation of Joseph, the Arch-Duke, to the Throne of the Kingdom of Hungary; the Turks were on the other side busy in pulling down, and deposing Mahomet their Sultan, and in his place, raising and setting up his Brother Solyman to be their Lord and Em∣peror. Whilst these things were in agitation, the Blocade of Agria continued, and the place greatly straitned by Marquess Doria. And the Duke of Loraine having agreed all things with the Prince and Estates of Transilvania, and setled and secured his Army in their Winter-Quarters, found a vacancy to ab∣sent himself from the Camp, and ease his mind after the troubles of a long and ha∣zardous Campaigne: Accordingly the Duke in company with the Marquess of Baden Durlach, took his Journey towards the Im∣perial Court, and in his way visited Mar∣quess Doria; and taking a survey of the Blocade of Agria, gave such Orders therein, as were most convenient to force a speedy surrender of the place; and thence proceed∣ing to Possonium, he was there received by his Imperial Majesty, with such Honours and gracious Expressions, as befitted the Worth and Merit of so brave and fortunate a General. And having remained some few days at this place, he took his leave of the Emperor, and his Journey to Insprug, being all the way honoured with the Prai∣ses, Acclamations, and Blessings of the People. In the mean time Agria being miserably straitned for want of Victuals, many died, and others to avoid Famine, abandoned the Town, and fled privately to other places: Those which remained within, grew desperate of all relief: For Tekely had promised them Succours, and in pursuance thereof in∣tended to pass the Tibiscus; but meeting there with some Forces under Count Sarau, was forced to retire, leaving Agria to its own Fate: Of which the People having In∣formation, they all arose, and with one consent laying before the Pasha their mise∣ries, in which they must (if not prevented) in a short time inevitably perish, they con∣strained him to propose a Treaty, and send Two Hostages to the Imperial Camp; which being accordingly done, the Marquess of Doria accepted them, and in exchange there∣of sent Two others to the City. The Arti∣cles were easily agreed, but not so soon exe∣cuted; for the Pasha out of an unnecessary caution, required that the Capitulations should be confirmed by the Hand of the Em∣peror; in compliance with which demand, Marquess Doria dispatched Count Anthony of Lamberg, a Carinthian Gentleman, with an Aga, to make tender of the Articles to the Emperor; the which having been exa∣mined, were Approved, Confirmed, and Signed by his Imperial Majesty. The Articles being returned with their Confirmation, and the Writings of Treaty exchanged, Count Marsigli with a Com∣missary of the Artillery, was sent into the Town, that with his usual Zeal, and dex∣terous Management of Affairs, which he had evidenced in several occasions in the Emperor's Service, he might take notice of the state of the place, and the Provisions belonging to it. The Count being entred into the Gates, was received kindly by the People, and with much faithfulness was shewed all the Magazines, Stores, and Am∣munition of the place. We must not expect to receive any account of Victuals, for those were long since consumed; but as to Ammunition, there were Twenty thousand Cannon-Bullets remaining, of which Four Thousand were for Whole Cannon; One Thousand hundred Weight of Powder, Twenty thousand Hand-Granadoes, besides great quantities of Bombs and Carcasses, many thousands of Match, One hundred and Ten Pieces of Cannon, five Mortar Pieces,
and nine Mines and Countermines; not∣withstanding all which, Famine being a stron∣ger Enemy within, than all the Troops and Forces were without; on the 16th of De∣cember the City was surrender'd,  and accor∣ding to the Capitulations, Carts were pro∣vided, and the Soldiers and Inhabitants with their Women and Children, and with their Goods and Baggage were permitted to March out; and then Russan the Pasha de∣liver'd up the Keys of the City, Castle and Magazines, to the Hand of General Caraffa, who at the Head of the Imperial Troops ranged in good order, stood ready to re∣ceive them.General Caraffa treas the Pasha of Agria. Then the General conducted the Pasha to his Tent, and there treated him with a very sumptuous Dinner; after which he presented him with several fine Horses, and two Carts laden with Refresh∣ments. Various discourses having passed between them, at length Russan Pasha taking his leave, said these words, Into your Hands, as Commissioner for the Emperor of the Ro∣mans I surrender this City without Blood; for having endured a Famine of seven Months without Bread, I could hold it out no longer, but am forced to give up a place, which one of my Emperor took with his own Hands; wherefore do you give God thanks; for this and all other Successes are from the appointment, and dispo∣sition of the most High. All the Garrison, with Men, Women and Children, which marched out, were Three thousand five hundred; about Six hundred remained in the place and submitted to the Imperial Sovereignty. It was sad to hear the Miseries of those People recounted, who had for several Months lived on nothing but boyled Herbs; and if a piece of Horse-flesh could have been purchased with Gold, to dress and put in the Pot with them, it would have been a Feast for several Days. The constancy of this People in their suffer∣ings cannot be sufficiently expressed; so that as the Blocade it self was the most fa∣mous of any in our Age, so the Surrender of the place was of high importance; for Thirteen Counties depended thereon,The advan∣tage of ta∣king A∣gria. and the Emperor thereby became absolute Ma∣ster of all that Country, which lies between the Danube and the Tibiscus; and laid Mon∣gatz open and exposed to greater danger, which was already blocked up by Forces quarter'd round the place. Thus having fi∣nished the relation of this year's Wars in Hun∣gary, it will be pertinent to our History to pass over into the Morea, and there take a Survey of that Country, and recount the Exploits and Atchievements, performed there this year by the Venetian Arms. At the beginning of this Year, the Senate ordained three days of solemn Devotion to implore the Divine Blessing on the Arms of that Republick, which was performed with many Processions, expence of Lamps and Wax;Prayers at Venice for Success. and with many Vows and Prayers of the People. So soon as the Season be∣came Ripe and fit for Action, it was resol∣ved by the Captain General, the Cavalier Francis Morosini, with the Universal consent of all the Commanders at a Council of War held the 21st of July, to enter the River of Patras, and accordingly the whole Fleet, with the Vessels which transported the Land Forces, Provisions and Ammunition loosed from Glimino on the 20th of July, and made a glorious appearance in those Seas, being composed of Twenty six Gallies, six Galeasses, besides Eighty seven Vessels of other sorts;The Vene∣tian Ar∣mado Sail to Patras. that is to say, Ships, Pinks, Petaches and such like, who were all Commanded by the Governour Zaguri. This Fleet Sailing all that Night with a prosperous Gale, on the 21st in the Morning came in sight of the Castles and Fortress of Patras; at appear∣ance of which the Turks being much alarum'd came down in great numbers, and pitched their Tents, some on the Top of a Hill, and others on the side of the main Castle. The better to discover the State and Condition of the Turkish Camp, the lighter Vessels were Commanded to Coast along the Shoar, by which and by some Spies it was known, and advised in what manner their whole Camp was disposed; a Detachment of which under shelter of a Trench, which they had thrown up, fired many Vollies of Small-shot against the Vessels which coasted along the Shoar; but proceeded no farther to annoy their Enemies than unto the end of their Line;The Turks Trenches. which when the Captain Ge∣neral observed, and the difficulty of Lan∣ding near those places, he enter'd into the River of Rumelia, which in like manner he found to be guarded by great numbers of Turks, and a Trench like the former cast up near the Castle. The General Konismark (of whom with due Honour we have made men∣tion in the Transactions of the last year, was embarked on the Admiral Gally with the Captain General, to have the better convenience to consult and confer together) was of Opinion, that notwithstanding all the Preparations the Turks had made near the Castle, and that the Seraskier of the Morea was encamped near the Town of Patras, and two other Pashas not far distant from thence, and the Banks along Guarded by Parapets or Breast-works; yet, that the most fit and commodious place to Land, was in the River of Patras it self; which be∣ing agreed, the Troops were disposed in an extraordinary manner of Military Discipline, and order'd speedily to Land, which was done with great Resolution: The first to set Foot on the Shoar were the Germans, who were
followed by all the other Troops, without any hindrance,The Chri∣stians land. or obstruction from the E∣nemy at their Landing; because the place being in some manner guarded and defended by a Morass, or Wet-ground, the Turks thought themselves on some kind of disad∣vantage, in case of an Attack. The Troops being landed, and drawn up in Battalia, the Germans led the Van, and marching with great bravery to the Right, were charged by a strong Detachment of the Turks; whom they received with such Vigour,The Turks Retreat. that they caused them to Retreat, and afterwards betake themselves to a shameful Flight. This first step being thus fortunately begun, gave Courage to the Christians, and Resolution to the Captain General Morosini, to fall on the Seraskier in his Camp be∣fore he was reinforced by more Troops, which daily joyned with him. At first land∣ing all the Venetian Army consisted of no more than Nine thousand Foot, and Thirteen hundred Horse; those Forces having been much diminished by the Fatigues of the last year, and the Sickness of their Winter-Quarters, but now being recruited by great numbers of Levents and Greeks, who as Volontiers came over from Zant and Cefalo∣nia, the Army became numerous and capa∣ble to undertake any Enterprize. But to facilitate the Designs; it was adjudged ne∣cessary to cut off all Communication between the Castles; the which was no sooner or∣dered than put in Execution,Some Gal∣lies pass the Castles. by the entrance of divers Gallies, which by favour of the Night adventured to pass the Dardanelli, or narrow Passages into the bottom of the Gulf, without any other hurt or loss, than of four or five Men at the Oars by a Can∣non-shot; the which Gallies were followed by a Galleot and three Felucas, Command∣ed by Magnar, a Knight of Malta. This un∣expected appearance of the Venetian Colours within the Dardanelli, as it struck a great Terror and Amazement to the Turks, being a Streight which they thought impossible to be passed by any Vessel whatsoever; so it gave the Christians a Resolution to Attack the Seraskier, who according to a Report of certain Prisoners taken in a Boat passing from the Morea to Rumelia side, lay not far off encamped with an Army of 10.000 Foot, and 4000 Horse; and that a Reserve of 5000 Foot more, and 1000 Horse lay quar∣tered about five Italian Miles from thence. The Gallies within the Gulf made great Tri∣umph with their Flags and Streamers; and made themselves Masters of Fourteen Gali∣ots or Brigantines, which had long served for Capers or Picaroons, to Rob and Plun∣der in those Seas. This Success enlivening the Spirits of the Christians, it was resol∣ved at a Council of War, to March by the side of the Hill to attempt the Seraskier's Camp, as a way the least incommoded by the Ene∣my's Cannon; and where was place suffici∣ent to draw up the Battalions in good order. In pursuance of this Resolution on the 24th of July by break of day, General Ko∣nismark drew up the Army, and disposed them in order of Battle, and advanced boldly on the Enemy, who consisted of Ten thou∣sand Foot and Four thousand Horse: And in the mean time the Captain General with some light Vessels directed the Galeasses,Konismark draws up the Army. to de¦stroy a Battery of the Enemy erected near the Sea-side; and to drive out of a Trench two Troops of Turkish Horse, a Marine Regi∣ment was landed under Command of Cap∣tain Negro, who in a short time made them∣selves Masters of the Battery, on which were divers Pieces of Cannon, two where∣of were of Brass. The Seraskier enraged at the loss of these places, and seeing the Enemies Troops ad∣vance upon him, feared to be assaulted in the Rear, or surprized in their Trenches; to prevent which, he made a Detachment of some of his best Troops to meet the Enemy and Skirmish with them; in which Action thô the Turks seemingly shew∣ed Resolution; yet they did it in that loose manner, running at first as it were on the Face of the Enemy, and then turning their Backs, as if they designed thereby to disturb the good Order of the Christians; who still main∣tained and kept their Ranks with a Regular steddiness, and still advanced forward to come unto their desired Engagement. At length about three a Clock in the After-noon the Turks began to Skirmish with a Battalion Commanded by Colonel Ceclina,A Fight. who so well behaved themselves, that they put the Ene∣my to Flight: Which when the Seraskier observed, he gave out the Signal for the whole Army to Engage, and to Charge the Christians both in the Front and in the Flank, trusting to his Troops, which were much Superiour in number to their Ene∣mies. Their first attack was with the usual Cry of Alah, Alah, accompanied with the Vollies of all their Small-shot, after which they fell furiously on with their Scemyters in their Hands. The first Fire was received and sustained by the Germans, flanked by the Cro∣atian Cavalry of the left Wing, without moving the least Step backwards, and par∣ticularly by the old Veterane Regiments of Brunswick, who according to their usual Bravery, repulsed the Enemy with conti∣nued Vollies of Shot; and the Cavalry un∣der Command of that renowned Captain the Marquis of Corbon, so vigorously seconded the Foot, that the Turks began to give Way and Retreat, and soon afterwards to be∣take themselves to a shameful Flight. The
Christians were very eager to pursue the flying Enemy,The Turks defeated. but the General Konismark suspecting some treacherous Ambuscade, gave a stop to the Valiant Heat of his Army. At the same time, the Captain General took this opportunity to Command Cap∣tain Negro with his Battalions to advance to the bottom of the Gulf of Lepanto, from whence all the Forces both of the Fleet, and the Land Soldiers giving a loud Shout, put the Turks into such a Consternation, that they abandoned all their Works raised at the bottom of the Gulf; and giving Fire first to their Magazine of Powder and Am∣munition, they followed the Example of their flying Seraskier or General. In this manner by the Blessing of the Di∣vine Providence, this strong Fortress of Pa∣tras fell into the Hands of the Venetians,Patras taken. which in former times had withstood nu∣merous Armies of the Turks. In ancient days Emanuel Emperor of the Greeks, find∣ing himself not in a Condition to defend this place against the prosperous, and the then successful Arms of the Turks, resigned it into the Hands of the Venetians to be defended by them, who so well fortified the place with such Works and Cannon, that the Turks laying Siege thereunto in the year 1465, were able to avail nothing; but afterwards returning with a more powerful and invincible Army in the year 1496, and laying Siege to the place; after a long and valorous defence was forced to yield it self to the power of the Turk, in whose Hands it hath ever remained, until this year of 1687, when it yielded it self to the Victo∣rious Arms of the Evangelist St. Mark. So soon as the News hereof came to the knowledge of the Captain General, he im∣mediately weighed Anchor, and by break of Day in the Morning, Sailed with his whole Fleet under the Castle of Rumelia, where he found Mahomet Pasha Encamped with Six thousand Men. This Surprize was so sudden, that the Turks having no time to consult, or send for other Succours or Auxiliaries, with great Precipitation betook themselves to a shameful Flight, giving Fire in the first place to all their Magazine of Powder,Mahoment Pasha put to Flight. the force of which shook down a great part of that Wall which looks towards the Sea. Upon these Successes, the Cap∣tain General following the Air of his good Fortune, Commanded all the Fleet to bring their Chase-guns on the Head of their Ships and Gallies, to bear on the Fortress of Le∣panto, which was a most admirable Stru∣cture, and so strong, that in ancient times it had ruined those Armies and Fleets, which had made Attacks upon it:The Fort of Lepanto battered. But now the Fortune of the Turks being changed; and therewith their Spirits sunk and grown low, they were not able to sustain the shot of the Venetians; but taking whatsoever with them, that they could carry on their Backs and Shoulders, they abandoned the place, leaving a free access and entrance there∣into at the pleasure and will of their Ene∣mies: Thus did the Venetians in less than Twenty four hours time, erect their Flag on four several strong Fortresses, with little damage on their side,The Seras∣kier Flies to Corinth. but with considerable slaughter of the Turks, and loss of the greatest part of the Baggage, Ammunition and Tents in their Camp; from whence the Seraskier marched with great fear and hast to Corinth. In these four places the Venetians took Sixty Pieces of Cannon, most of them of Brass, with eight Pieces in the Camp of the Seraskier, and other six from the Camp of Mustapha Pasha, with great Stores of Provisions of all sorts. The News of this happy Success was dispatched to Venice with all diligence by Sergeant Major Nicolo Rossi, who embarked on a Feluca belonging to the State, and happily arrived at that City on a Sunday, whilst the Grand Counsel of ten were actu∣ally Sitting; The Letters from the Captain General being opened and Read, giving a distinct Account of the Blessings of Hea∣ven on the Venetian Arms, it pleased the Senate to give immediate Order, that so∣lemn Thanks should be render'd to God Almighty in all places of publick Devotion, for his Benedictions and gracious Deliver∣ances: And accordingly his Serene High∣ness the Doge, assisted by all the Ambassadors and Senators,Rejoycings at Venice. and Magistrates in their pur∣ple Robes, descended into the Ducal Chap∣pel of St. Mark, where Te Deum was solemn∣ly Sung with most excellent Harmony, and Musick of all sorts of Instruments, with firing the Guns, ringing of Bells, and several other Expressions of Joy and Tri∣umph; the which Festival of Joy continued for the space of three Days. These Demonstrations of publick Joy be∣ing concluded, the Senate which hath been always munificent in their Gifts and Ho∣nours unto those, who have rendered Servi∣ces to their Republick, were pleased in the High Counsel of the Pregadi, to ordain,Rewards given to the Gener∣als. that to the eternal Memory of the glorious Triumphs of the Captain General Francesco Morosini, that the Horse-tails and Stan∣dards, which are the Opima Spolia, or Royal Spoils, taken from the Seraskier or Tur∣kish General in the Field, should be placed in the Senatorian Chamber: And that a Sta∣tue of Brass representing the Person of Mo∣rosini should be erected, with such an In∣scription as might conserve the Glory of his Name to all Ages. The term of time in which Count Konismark was to exercise the Office of General, was enlarged for seven
years, beyond the time specified in his Pa∣tent, with an Augmentation of Six thou∣sand Ducats to his ordinary Stipend, so that for the seven years to come, he was to re∣ceive Twenty four thousand Ducats a year; To the Prince of Brunswick a Jewel was or∣dained of Four thousand Ducats; To the Prince of Savoy a Sword was appointed, with a Hilt set with precious Stones, to the value of Twenty four hundred Ducats; To Marquis Corbon Eight hundred Ducats a year were allotted, as an Addition to his former Salary: All, or most of the other General Officers were gratified with Pre∣sents, agreeable to their quality; and such as were Venetians were promoted to Offices, and places of Trust in the State, and some to the Patrician Dignity. Thus whilst all things were Triumphant at Venice, the Morea was filled with Slaugh∣ter and Consternation of the Turks, who terrified with the entire Defeat and Flight of the Seraskier,The Turks Fly out of the Morea. and the Surrender of Lepanto, Patras, and two other Castles of consider∣able Force, resolved to give way to Fortune, and to quit and abandon the Kingdom of Morea. For indeed, the loss which the Turks had sustained, was far greater than it was computed at first; for besides those which were Slain in the Field of Battle, a∣bove Two thousand were found dead in the High-ways, in Ditches and under Rocks: And divers Soldiers Adventurers, who to get many Slaves, were so bold as to Rove about in the Country, reported, that in the Fields and Villages, every where they met with dead Bodies and wounded Men. To pursue this Victory, and follow the Foot-steps of Fortune, which so fairly presented it self, the Captain General leaving the great Ves∣sels of his Fleet at the two Castles of Ru∣melia and Lepanto, enter'd farther into the Gulf of Lepanto with his lighter Gallies, and coasting along by the Land-side, he so affrighted the Turks, that carrying away with them what Goods were portable, they followed the Foot-steps of their flying Army. And being mad and enraged to leave their native Soil, they carried away with them whole Families of Christians into Slavery: But the Peasants or Country People alarum∣ed hereat, and encouraged by the Successes of the Christians, arose in Arms against them, and recovered back the greatest part of their Wives and Children, as they were leading them into Captivity, killing and taking many of the Fugitives. The Noise hereof served still to amaze and confound the Turks;Mustapha Pasha Flies to Salona. so that Mustapha Pasha fled with all Precipitation without so much as being pursued by the Enemy, taking his March towards Salona, not far from which place he encounter'd with Ishmael Pasha, who had with him a Thousand Soldiers, which he brought from Salonica, alias Thessalonica. These two Commanders with fear, and uncertainty what to act, remained some days at Salona; for considering that in case they should remain there, they should lie exposed to the Attack of the Enemy; and then in case they should march and joyn with the Seraskier at Corinth, they were in danger of being strangled by him, for ha∣ving been so tardy in their March, and so backward in coming to his assistance, where∣fore they took a Resolution to become a Convoy to those Families of Turks, who in great numbers with Women and Children had quitted the Morea, and were going to plant themselves in the upper parts of Greece. In the mean time the Captain General Sailing with Victorious Arms, and a pro∣sperous Gale by the Shoar of the Gulf of Lepanto,The Vene∣tians An∣chor before Corinth. came in a short time to take a full view and prospect of the ancient City of Corinth; in the Road of which they came to an Anchor with all their Fleet of Gallies and Galeots: But because that Gulf is com∣monly subject to bad and tempestuous Wea∣ther, and the Navigation in those Seas very dangerous, there being no Port on the Mo∣rea side within a Hundred Miles; and on the other, no shelter besides a small Nook or Creek, which is narrow and not capable to receive many Vessels, and the Water shal∣low; therefore the Captain General proceed∣ing with due caution according to Milita∣ry discipline, dispeeded some of his lighter Vessels to Fathom the depth of the Waters, and to take a survey of the State, and Con∣dition of the Enemies Camp. The affrighted Turks seeing the Venetian Fleet in the Road of Corinth, did of their own accord set Fire to all the Villages and Houses round about,The Turks burn and abandon Corinth. and also to the Town it self, blowing up all the Ammunition, and destroying the Provisions which they could not carry with them; and so quitted and a∣bandoned that anciently famous City, leaving it a Prey to their Enemies at a cheep rate, without the least drop of Blood; and thence possessed with a Panick fear marched away to Thebes, there to make their place of Ren∣dezvous for their scattered Troops to unite. The Captain General being informed that the Turks had deserted the City, or Village rather (as it now remains) and reduced as much as they could of it unto Ashes, return∣ed with all speed imaginable to the Castles of Rumelia and Morea, where he had left the most considerable part of his Forces en∣camped, as also some Gallies and Vessels belonging to his Fleet: And there taking aboard the greatest part of the Infantry, whilst the Cavalry marched by Land, with some Regiments of Foot under the Com∣mand
of Count Konismark, they all came to joyn near the Town of Corinth;The Chri∣stians take possession of the place. and thence in order of Battle took possession of the place, where they scarce found a House, or Lodging wherein to cover or shelter them∣selves; such havock and destruction had the Turks made of every thing besides the Walls: The Gates also of the Fortress were found open, and an easy entrance thereinto; which being possessed by the Companies of Colo∣nel Bonetti, and Count Vertoua, the Stand∣ard of St. Mark was displaid on the Walls. The City of Corinth was anciently the Me∣tropolis of all Achaia; and therefore called by Lucius Florus Achaiae Caput, & Greciae Decus: After it had fallen under the Govern∣ment of the Roman Commonwealth, many Battles were fought near the Walls of that City,A descrip∣tion of Co∣rinth. under the Command of several Ge∣nerals, such as Critolzus, Metellus and Mum∣mius. The Corinthian Brass is famous over all the World, for the admirable mixture of it with divers other Mettles, amongst which there was some proportion of Gold which enter'd into the Composition. The Art of making this Brass is now entirely lost, and the quantity thereof not much at present in the World; for all the ancient Statues of famous Men of Greece, erected at Corinth of this sort of Brass, were by Wars and Al∣terations in the State melted down and car∣ried to Rome, which afterwards being work∣ed into Plates, served to cover the Roof of the Pantheon, now called the Rotondo at Rome; and thence by order of the Barberini were ripped off, and an Altar made thereof consecrated to St. Peter and St. Paul, in the great Basilicon of St. Peter; the Over-plus of which was turned into a Cannon, and placed in the Castle of St. Angelo; which gave occasion to that saying, Quod non fece∣runt Babari, fecerunt Barberini. The Situation of Corinth is in a rich and fertile Country, and in a sweet Air, and so near the Sea, that it enjoyed the benefit and use of all the Elements, rendring it a place of Plenty and Luxury, which gave occasion to that saying, Non cuivis homini contingit adire Corinthum. Near this place is the Mount Parnassus, and the Fountain of He∣licon. From the Romans Corinth descended to the Grecian Emperors, one of which cal∣led Emanuel, over-threw Roger King of Na∣ples, who invaded the Countries near Co∣rinth. Not long afterwards the Despots of Greece yielded it up to the Republick of Ve∣nice, who defended it for some years, un∣til overpowred with the force and numbers of Mahomet the Second, were at length com∣pelled to give it up to his Tyranny: Since which time it hath ever remained in the Hands of the Turks, until this year of 1687, when God favouring the Christian Arms in this, as well, as in other parts, was pleased to restore this City to the Venetians, the an∣cient Lords and Possessors of it. The Albanians encouraged with these Suc∣cesses, and the Flight of the Turks,The Alba∣nans fall on the Turks. pursued after them, and falling on their Rear seized on their Baggage, and all their Beasts of Bur∣den, such as Horses, Camels, Mules and Asses; carrying away Men, Women and Children Captives, with great Droves of Cattle to the City of Megara. These happy events were followed by the Surrender of Castle Tornese,Castle Tor∣nese Sur∣renders. at the first Sum∣mons made by Captain Negro, upon no o∣ther Conditions than that they should save their Lives, and have License to carry away all their Goods and Baggage, which was freely granted to them, with Vessels to Transport them to Smyrna. But before their departure, about an Hundred and fifty Turks, Inhabitants of that Castle, voluntarily declar∣ed themselves Christians, and were desirous of being Baptized; amongst these were many Families of the Gastuni, who having a Territory of their own, containing some Hundred of Houses and Cottages, desired all to be received into the Bosom of the Christian Church; all which were in a So∣lemn manner Baptized together; to the great Confusion and Displeasure of the Ma∣hometan Professors. The Report of these Successes,  with the appearance of so great a Fleet at Corinth, struck all the Inhabitants of the Morea with such Terrour and Consternation, that they voluntarily submitted themselves to the Ve∣netian Government; as namely Misitra, Sa∣ritenea, Idrapolica, all which places were abandoned by the Turks: Only Salona,Several o∣ther Towns submit. a Town well peopled, and Situate in a rich Soyl, which lies within a small Gulf so cal∣led, sent two Turks to the Captain General to offer a Tribute to him, provided they might live under their own Laws and Go∣vernment; but this seeming a ridiculous Proposition under their present Circum∣stances, it was absolutely rejected: Where∣upon the rich and ruling Turks of the City,As also Salona. with fear and precipitation removed their Goods and Families and Fled; and the City yielded it self to the power, and under the subjection of the Conquerour: And so suc∣cessfully had all things proceeded through the course of this Campain, that besides the Cities gained with very little Blood, as before related, Three hundred Pieces of Cannon, most of Brass were added to the publick Stock; besides Thousands of Slaves, Am∣munition and Provisions. All things thus fal∣ling at the Feet of the Venetians, the Land Army both of Horse and Foot encamped near Corinth, under Command of Count Conismark, whilst the Captain General with
the greatest part of the Armado coasted round the Morea, to visit, and strengthen the pla∣ces newly reduced, and especially those parts which are bordering on the Gulf of Egena. In the mean time many Families of Greece, which had for a long time been oppressed by the Tyranny of the Turkish Government, made their Petition to the Captain General, that they might be transported to some Country under the Venetian Dominion, where they might enjoy Freedom and Se∣curity,Several Greek Fa∣milies transpor∣ted to the Morea. both in their Religion and Estates. Morosini considering well that the multitude of People is the Riches and strength of a Country; and that the Morea being almost emptied of People, and desolate by the Flight and Desertion of the Turks, easily condescended to their request, and accor∣dingly dispeeded the Proveditor Pisani with four Gallies, and some other Transport Ves∣sels to carry away the People, of which many Thousands with their Baggage and Cattle were Embarked, and Landed in di∣vers parts of the Morea, where those Fami∣lies are at present setled. The Successes of the Venetian Arms had now gained such Reputation in all parts,Mitra Sur∣renders. that Mitra, a strong and considerable place submitted, and fol∣lowed the Fortune of other places; for the Turks therein, at the first appearance only of Polani the Proveditor of Sarnata, with some Marine Forces displaying their white Flag, enter'd into a Treaty and gave Hostages for performance of Articles; the which was soon performed, and the place yielded to the Conqueror. The Surrender of this City produced many other happy consequences, one of which, was, that thereby Napoli di Malvasia became greatly streightned, and all hopes of Relief and Succour cut off, when on any occasion it should happen to be distressed: And now to terrifie and amuse that Garrison,  and the Inhabitants, who by the numbers therein, and the Situation of the place were very strong, and able to make a considerable resistance, Captain Ve∣nier (who was newly returned from block∣ing up the Turkish Fleet at Rhodes, many of which Ships were come from Egypt laden with Rice,Malvasia alarumed. and other Provisons for Constan∣tinople) was order'd to appear before the Town with his Squadron of Ships, and some Corsairs, whom he had accidentally met with in the Seas; to which the Capt. Ge∣neral joyning some of the lighter Gallies, caused such an appearance to be made, something terrible to the People of Malva∣sia, as might give them an Alarum, and Pre∣pare and dispose them to a Surrender. The Venetians Sailing with a prosperous Gale of Fortune, resolved, if possible, to Crown the Atchievements of this Cam∣pain, with the glorious Conquest of that ancient City of Athens, in order to which design (thô the Season of the year was far spent) yet the Captain General leaving a strong detachment at Corinth, gave Orders to the remainder of his Fleet to Sail to the other side of the Isthmus, which is the full compass and circle of the Morea; and in his way coming before the Walls of Malvasia, he sent a Summons to the Turks, who main∣tained the Peninsula of that strong Fortress; but they returning a proud Answer, and shewing a resolution to defend themselves, the Captain General was pleased to bestow cer∣tain Bombs and Cannon upon them,And is Bombed. which ruined a part of the Town, and did some damage to the Castle; but having a design upon Athens, he thought not fit to Land his Men, but to proceed forward to Port Leon,  where being arrived on the 20/10 of Sept. both Horse and Foot were immediately Landed,A design upon A∣thens. and took their March in an order∣ly manner to the Walls of Athens. Port Leon is so called from the Image of a Lyon, erected on a Pedestal at the bottom of the Port, and may be about six or seven Eng∣lish Miles distant from Athens. So soon as the Turks of that place had the News of the descent, or landing of the Venetinn Troops, they abandoned the City and Houses there∣abouts, and full of fear and amazement fled into the Castle:Which is Summon'd. Which according to the usual Custom being summoned to Surrender on fair and gentle Terms, an Answer was returned with proud expressions, evidencing a resolution to defend the place to the utmost extremity. Whereupon General Ko∣nismark entrenched round the Town,The Castle battered. raised a Battery of six Pieces of Cannon and four Mortar-pieces, with which he began to Bat∣ter the Castle, which was Situate on a high Rock, that on three sides of it was inacces∣sible; and because that part which lay open was all Rock, without Earth to cover the Men, it was very difficult to make nearer Approaches; so that for the space of eight days, all that could be done, was to shoot fiery Bullets and Bombs into the place, which had so good effect, that one falling into their Magazine of Powder, Blew up a great part of the Castle into the Air, bury∣ing most of the People in the Ruins. The Seraskier having gathered some of his dispersed Troops into a Body, took his March towards Athens, as if he had intend∣ed to relieve the place:The Seras∣kier dares not Fight. Upon advice of which General Konismark drew off a strong party both of Horse and Foot, and march∣ed away to meet the Seraskier; whose Spi∣rit being cowed by the late ill Successes in the Morea, durst not stand the Shock, or try his Fortune in another Battle, but re∣treated, and fled with his Forces to strong Holds in the Mountains.
This shameful Flight of the Seraskier, gave sufficient evidence and proof to the Besieged of the weak and low Condition of the Se∣raskier, the which being joyned to the late unhappy Accident of blowing up the Maga∣zine of Ammunition, so dispirited the De∣fendants, that finding themselves without all probable hopes of Relief, they displaied a white Flag,The Castle of Athens surrenders. to shew their desires to Capitu∣late; and accordingly a Treaty was enter'd into and concluded in few Articles. The Articles of Treaty.That the Soldiers should march forth without Arms, and with no more Goods than what they could at one time carry on their Shoulders. And 2dly, That in the space of Five days they should quit the place; which was accordingly performed at the expiration thereof; about Three thousand Souls in all going out, of which not above Six hundred men were capable to bear Arms: To which, Licence was given to take so much Provision with them, as might serve to sustain them as far as Smyr∣na, or any other place, to which they were desirous to be Transported. But many of the Greeks being not willing to leave their Dwellings and their Native Soyl, remained still in the City; and amongst the Turks about Three hundred professing the Christian Faith, were received to Baptism,Some Turks turn Chri∣stians. of which we find very few Examples amongst the Turks in other places, who are as firm and constant to their Mahometan Principles, as any Sect in the World are to theirs. Only I observe that the Turks in Greece are more easily per∣suaded to embrace the Christian Faith, than they are in other Countries; perhaps be∣cause they are for the most part sprung from Christian Parents, and are married to Chri∣stian Wives, and have most of their Con∣versation with them; so that it is no won∣der if the Rites and Services of the Chri∣stian Religion, which are become familiar to them, should be more easily embraced by these than other Turks who are Educa∣ted with a detestation and abhorrence to Christianity. In the Castle were found Eighteen Pie∣ces of Cannon of divers sorts and metals; the City it self remained entire with little damage,The des∣cription of Athens. thô ruined, and grievously destroy∣ed by other Wars. It was anciently the capital City of all Attica, the Walls of which are about Three miles in compass; within which are the Ruins of many stately Edifi∣ces, which by Time and Wars have lost their Names and Memory of what they were. There is one Magnificent Palace supported by Pillars of Marble, upon one of which is Engraven in Greek Characters, This is Athens, the Ancient Seat of Theseus: There is also the Pantheon, on the Walls of which are Engraven the Figures of the Grecian Champions; there are also Two Horses to be seen cut in Stone, which are said to be the Workmanship of Praxiteles: Moreover there are many other Antiquities there to be seen, which are not the Subject of this History. Only it is observable, That in this place is the best Air of the World, which served to quicken the Wits, and clear the Understand∣ings of Young Students, who were sent to that University to have their Education. This City being thus fallen into the hands of the Venetians, the Government thereof was committed to the charge of Daniel Delfin, a Nobleman of Venice. The News of the taking of Athens flying into all the Towns and Countries round about, so terrified the People of Megara,Megara burnt. that not attending the Assault or Approach of the Enemy, they with fearful Consternation abandoned the place, and carrying with them what in such a precipitate haste was portable, they left the rest to the disposal of the Venetians; who considering it as a place rather troublesome than useful, delivered it up to the Mercy of the Flames. As the Venetian Arms were prosperous in the Morea, and other parts of Greece,  under the wise and happy Conduct of the Captain-General Francesco Morosini; so were they not less successful in Dalmatia, and Albania, under the Valorous Guidance of that worthy Gener∣al Gerolemo Cornaro Procurator of St. Mark. On the First of September a Squadron of the Venetian Armado (distinct from that which was commanded by General Morosini) con∣sisting of some Gallies, Galiot Ships,Castel Nuovo at∣tacked. and other Transport Vessels, appearing before the Town of Castel Nuovo, greatly alarum'd the Garrison, and People therein; of which they conceived the greater Dread and Apprehen∣sions; because they had observed that the Auxiliary Gallies, which had long been ho∣vering about the Coast of Dalmatia were come in, and had joyned the Armado, at∣tended with great Numbers of Vessels la∣den with Ammunition and Provisions; and re-inforced by certain Veterane Troops be∣longing to the G. Duke of Toscany. On the Second of September,Septem. 1687. Girolamo Cornaro Proveditor-General of the Venetian Forces in Dalmatia and Albania, endeavour∣ed to Land the Militia, with all necessary Appurtenances of War at a place called Com∣burt, which was a Port environed round with Hills and Rocks, and had been a place very proper for Landing, had not the Turks pre-possessed the important Passes of it,The Vene∣tians Land. and encompassed it about with a strong Trench; howsoever the Venetians resolving to make a descent at that place, drove the Turks out of their Trenches, and landed all their Men, and Train of Artillery, with their Provisions and Instruments for War.
The first thing there to be done was to discover the face of the Enemy, which Calbo, the Proveditor Extraordinary, undertook, and with a Detatched Party brought News, that the Garrison of Castel Nuovo had lately been reinforced by the Neighbouring places, which the Turks were fortifying round about with Trenches, and Redoubts. In conside∣ration of which, it was resolved by common consent that another Descent should be made at a place called Zelenica; and accordingly that was performed by the Auxiliaries, as∣sisted by Two Battalions, under the Com∣mand of that undaunted General St. Paul, who began a Fight with the Enemy;A Fight begun. in which after Five hours time, the Venetians became Masters of the first Trenches, and soon afterwards drove the Turks out of the second, and proceeded to gain the Hill cal∣led Santa Veneranda, which commands the place: Where having raised a small Platform, and fortified it with Two small Guns, with which they shot red-hot Bullets into the Town, they soon made it too hot for the Inhabitants to abide, or the Soldiers in their Trenches to maintain: And thô the Pasha of Bosna came with all his Forces to their assistance, yet Two thousand Sol∣diers being seasonably landed by the Auxi∣liary Gallies on the East part of the Town towards the side of Ragusi, gave such an effectual Repulse to the Troops of that Pa∣sha,The Pasha of Bosna endeavours to relieve the Turks, that they betaking themselves to a most shameful Flight, left the Besieged in great Terror and Consternation. In the mean time the Morlachs, who are Thieves and Robbers by Nature, and Profession, entred the Town, and fell on the Plunder, which occasioned some Disorder, until the Provedi∣tor General by his Troops, and the Autho∣rity of his Person quieted the Tumult arisen about the Booty. After which the Militia of Malta advanced according to agreement, with so much courage to the very Muzzle of the Enemy's Musquets, and the false Bray of the Upper-Castle, that Four Cavaliers of Malta, and many of their Soldiers lost their Lives in this Action: Howsoever the Post was maintained with so much resoluti∣on against the Ottoman Fury, that Marquess Borro Sergeant-Major,And is re∣pulsed. flanked with some other Troops, coming timely to their assist∣ance, the Enemy was forced to a Retreat, and shelter themselves under the Cannon of the lower Fortress, leaving slain on the place, the Captain of the Castle, Two Agas, with several principal Officers, and a great Number of the common Soldiers. Thus the Turks being droven from all their Posts, and Outworks, which encompassed the Fortress; and the same possessed by the Ve∣netian Arms, the Siege became totally form∣ed on all parts; every principal Commander having his respective Post allotted unto him to guard and defend. The Turks observing themselves to be en∣vironed on all sides by a well-formed and close Siege, made a vigorous Sally with a Detachment of their Bravest and best Select∣ed Soldiers; but were as couragiously re∣ceived, and forced to retreat. Whilst things remained in this posture, Intelligence being brought to the Leaguer,Another Pasha en∣deavours to give succour. that the Pasha of Herzegovina was on his march for to succour and relieve the Town, a Detachment was immediately formed out of the Morlach and Perattine Troops to oppose him. This Pasha having lately served in Hungary under one Atlee-gick (which is as much as to say the little Horseman) was upon his Death promoted to the Government of Bosna, in the place of the other Pasha lately defeated; and with that Preferment being a little ele∣vated with Pride, marched forward with confidence of Victory, and Contempt of the Christian Camp;  and being on the top of that Hill, which was called Topgee (or the Gunner) he furiously made a descent on the Quarter of Perini, who upon the first Charge received a Wound, in his own person;A part of the Vene∣tians put to the rout. but the Body of his men stood firm and im∣moveable, whilst the Battalion of Sergeant Major Galli was put to the Rout, and Fled without looking behind them to the Sea-Coast: To remedy this disorder, Major-General Grimini, and the Proveditor-General, with the General of Malta, and all the chief Of∣ficers of the Army came in to their assistance, and caused the Run-aways to make a stand, and rally again, and make Head upon the Enemy. And then the Colonel of the Ge∣neral's Guards, with several other Captains coming up, with a Body of Granadiers, they mingled themselves with the Turks,The Turks defeated. and fighting with their Swords amidst the thickest of them, gave them such a repulse, that at first they began to give way, and afterwards to betake themselves to a shame∣ful Flight, leaving the Field with the Glory of the day to the Arms of the victorious Christians. In this Conflict Seven hundred of the Turks lay dead on the Ground; of which the prin∣cipal men were Zambeg, a famous and stout Commander, with many Agas, Bulluckba∣shees, and one Cadi or Judge; whose Heads being cut off from their Bodies to the Num∣ber of Three hundred, were fixed on Half-pikes, and ranged in order, before the Walls of the Town to be a Spectacle to the Be∣sieged of Terror, and an Evidence of the Vi∣ctory. Likewise Twelve Colours were ta∣ken, together with much Spoil and Booty, which was given as a Reward to the con∣quering Soldiers.
Upon this Success another Summons was sent to the Town, inviting them to a Sur∣render,Summons sent to the Town. upon consideration that the Forces being defeated, which came to their assist∣ance, there remained no other hope of safe∣ty than only, by yielding themselves on such Articles as should be offered on reasonable terms. The Besieged in Answer thereunto, having returned a plain and flat refusal of coming to any Conditions,Are refu∣sed. all acts of Hostili∣ty were renewed, and the Cannon began continually to play, which beat down one of the Towers, and made a large Breach on the Curtain, so that (notwithstanding the bad weather which gave some hindrance) great Advancement was made, to the damage of the Besieged: In like manner another Battery of Four Guns continually plyed the City, and such valorous Attempts were made by the Venetians, that in despite of all the Enemy's Fire, and frequent Sallies, they made them∣selves Masters of the Counterscarp; amidst all which Action the Florentine Troops came seasonably to their assistance. Whilst these things were, in agitation, Advices were brought that Two Pashas were on their march with numerous Troops for relief of the Town:The Turks march to relieve the Town. And that the Pasha of Albania being come as far as Podgoriza, was hastening with all expedition possible to joyn the other Troops, for the same intent of giving succour to the languishing City. Upon this Advice the Proveditor-General Cornaro, finding that the Breach made was of Six and thirty Paces in Breadth, and that by the fall of a Bomb into the great Tower towards the Sea-side, directed by the skilful Art of a Florentine Engenier, their great Ma∣gazine of Powder was blown up, by which many Families were buried in the Ruins, toge∣ther with divers Officers and Soldiers to the Number of Three hundred Persons: On this advantage,An Assault resolved. I say, the Proveditor resolved to make a speedy Assault, before the Pashas with their Forces could come to their assistance. Accordingly the Marquess Borro, with such Bravery began the Assault, that in despite of the resistance made by the Defendants, he mounted the Breach, and made himself Ma∣ster of one of the Redoubts, and thereby opened a free passage to many Troops to enter the Town; in which place also they found an obstinate resistance; for the Men fired out of the Windows, and the Women threw Stones from the Tops of the Hou∣ses; and all the Streets were barricadoed up by Carts and Timber laid in the way, which together with bad and rainy Weather, damaged the Assailants in such manner, that they were forced to retreat, and give way to their Adverse Fortune.The Assail∣ants forced to retreat. In this Conflict a Cavalier of Malta, a Lieutenant-Colonel called Julio, a Florentine Captain, with ma∣ny brave Soldiers of divers Nations were Slain, and in all to the Number of Five hundred were killed and wounded. How∣soever in despite of Misfortune, those who had possessed the Redoubt, and Breach on the Curtain, maintained their Post, having under obscurity of the Night, covered them∣selves with Faggots, and Sacks of Wooll. The next Morning being the Nine and twentieth of September, the Morlachs re∣solving to give some proofs of their Valour,1687. The Mor∣lachs re∣new the Assault. prepared themselves to give a fresh Assault; which they performed with such vigour, that notwithstanding the stout defence of the Besieged, and by continual Thundrings of the Bombs and Cannon, they made them∣selves Masters of a fortified House at the Foot of the Wall, and soon after on the Thirtieth of September, Forty Segmen, or Foot-Soldiers, who were placed for Guard of a Tower towards the Sea,The Tower yields. and had the defence of a long part of the Wall, came to Capitulations, and offered to deliver the same up into the hands of the Christians, provided they might have liberty to depart with their Families, and necessary Baggage, and might be Transported into Albania. The General consenting hereunto, the Tower and Wall were surrendered, and the People civilly treated, according to the Con∣vention: The Defendants of the middle Castle, seeing the lower Fortification in the hands of the Enemy, despaired of all means longer to defend themselves; and so entring into Capitulations, desired Six days time,Also the middle Tower. that in case the Succours came not to them within that Term, that then they would yield unto the Conditions of the Conqueror. But that being denied, and nothing but a sudden Surrender satisfying, the Defendants yielded on the same Conditions as the lower Fortress had done, marching out only with a single Burden on the Shoulders of each person. There remained now nothing to be sub∣dued after these Two lower Fortresses, be∣sides the higher Castle of all,The main Castle sur∣renders. the Garrison of which finding themselves devested of their Two main Bulwarks, resolved also up∣on a Surrender, the Articles of which were soon agreed upon the basis or foot of those Conditions, which had been granted unto the Two other Fortresses. Accordingly the People of the Castle marched out, to the Number of about Two thousand Two hun∣dred Souls, of which Seven hundred only were capable to bear Arms; the Place was found to have been well provided of all sorts of Ammunition and Provisions, with Seventy two Pieces of Cannon, besides a good Booty for the Soldiers. There were also Six light Frigats seized in the Port, which had been Corsars or Capers, having formerly done
great mischief at Sea, by their Piracies and Robberies. Thus did Castel Nuovo fall into the hands of the Venetians, being the more remarka∣ble, because it happened at a time, when Three Pashas, with very numerous Troops, were in the Neighbourhood, and as we may say, in sight of the place, with intention to succour and relieve it by force of Arms. Nor was this Noble Proveditor-General the Cavalier Girolamo Cornaro, less success∣ful, and renowned in taking the considera∣ble Fortress of Castel Nuovo, than he was in relieving and raising the Siege which the Turks had formed against Singh; the which place this same Cornaro had in the Year 1676, taken from the Turks, being the first of his Government of Dalmatia and Albania, and had now in this Year of 1687, the good fortune to preserve and maintain it from returning into the hands of its late barbarous Masters. In which Action this Noble person deserves as much Honour, as he purchased in the Conquest of it: It be∣ing no less a Vertue to defend and conserve, than to gain or win; according to that old saying, Non minor est virtus, quàm quaerere, parta tueri.  It being a great eye-sore to the Turks to see Singh, their own Native Habita∣tion, in the hands of the Christians, they were moved with indignation, and with a passionate desire to recover it again into their own possession. In pursuance whereof At∣leegick lately made Pasha of Bosna, drew out his Army in sight of Singh,The Turks endeavour to take Singh. and encamp∣ed in the Plan of Clivino, where he pitched many Tents; and his Army being encreased by great Numbers of Albanians, and the choicest Soldiery of the Provinces round about, and provided with all sorts of Am∣munition and Victuals both for Man and Horse, and with a considerable Train of Artillery, they thought upon their first ap∣pearance to affright the Garrison of Singh into a surrender. But the place having be∣fore been well provided with all things ne∣cessary, and defended by a valorous Garri∣son, they contemned the Summons of their Enemies, resolving to maintain the place to the last extremity. Whereupon the Turks having raised their Batteries, began to play upon it with their Cannon, but without any damage to the Be∣sieged. Hereupon the Turks changed their Attack from that, to another part, where their Horse and Foot were drawn up in Mi∣litary Order, with resolution to Storm the place, which they attempted by break of day in the Morning, falling on with great fury,Singh as∣saulted by Turks. and with their Scemyters in their hands thought immediately by force of Arms to carry the place: But the besieged so bravely defended themselves, that they gave them such repulse, as caused them to sound a Retreat, leaving behind them many of their Soldiers dead on the place, to the number of about Two hundred, of which the great∣est part were Albanians. In the Town the loss was very inconsiderable,They are repulsed. there being on∣ly the chief Engineer killed, and some few persons wounded. In the mean time the Proveditor-General Cornaro being informed of these successes, resolved to give effectual relief to the Town; and accordingly he detached several Parties of Morlachs to infest the Enemy on all sides; which they performed so successfully, that they returned with the Heads of many Turks, with Prisoners in Chains, and with a considerable booty, and Numbers of Cattle, having had the fortune to defeat a Convoy which was sent with Ammunition and Pro∣visions to the Turkish Camp. Howsoever the Turks still continuing the Siege which had now lasted Seventeen days, to which they had called all the Netferee, which are the Trained-Bands of the Country, and brought thereunto all the Cannon which remained in the fortified places round about; they did not doubt in a short time of the success they desired.The Siege raised. But all these hopes vanished away so soon as News came to Atleegick, that the Venetian Army was on their march to relieve the Town, with which they were so alarum'd and affrighted, that raising their Camp, Tents, and Baggage, they quitted the Siege, and ran away with a shameful and precipitate Cowardice. And thus ended the Successes of this Year 1687, to the Glory of God,  and Confusion to the Enemies of the Christian Faith. The Victories and Triumphs in Hungary gained by the Imperial Arms, were almost mira∣culous, as is before related; the successes in the Morea, with the subjection of Patras, Athens, and other places of Greece, were wonderful, and the relief given to Singh, and taking of Castel Nuovo, were all works of the Divine Providence. And when we farther consider the Tumults, Seditions, and Mutinies amongst the Turks themselves, to the deposing of their Sultan himself, and destruction of their Chief and Principal Of∣ficers by the madness and fury of the Sol∣diers, even almost to to the total destructi∣on of their Empire; we may believe, that the Hand of God was lifted up against this People, to bring them to the brink of Ruin, and Misery, and cause them to cease, and be no longer a People. Let us therefore proceed to the Ensuing Year, and therein relate the sequel of the wonderful works of God, in whose hands are the disposal of Empires and Kingdoms.
ANNO 1688. THE Emperor, who had from the time of the Incoronation of the King of Hungary remained at Presburg, (otherwise called Possonium) with all the Imperial Court, returned now at the beginning of this year to Vienna, and arrived there on the 26th of January.The Empe∣ror pre∣pares for the next Campaign. The Season was now come for making Preparations for the next Campaign against the Turks; and Consultations were held, not only to secure the new Conquests, but to advance farther, and to enlarge the Imperial Dominions; at all which his Ce∣sarean Majesty was pleased to assist in Per∣son. But in regard the Work was great, and the Charges immense to Recruit the old Regiments, and raise new, to provide Am∣munition, Provisions and Forage, for that vast Army which was designed for Hungary; His Imperial Majesty was pleased to con∣vene all the States of Austria, and of his Hereditary Dominions; who accordingly meeting and forming an August Assembly,The States of Austria convened. the Chancellor in the name of the Empe∣ror declared unto them in a Florid Oration, the neccessity that there was for a large sup∣ply of Money, whereby to carry on the War against the Turks, not only on the de∣fensive part, but also to advance forward in that way, which God had opened, and to en∣large the Dominions and extent of Christen∣dom. They pro∣mise Money.At the Conclusion of the Speech, the States of Austria having with most profound Reverence and Respect, returned their most humble Thanks to his Imperial Majesty for his gracious Clemency, they promised in the most submissive Terms imaginable, to answer the just Demands of his Majesty to the utmost of their Power. The like was done by the States of Stiria, the Govern∣our of which Province called Stubemberg, having offer'd to his Majesty the Sum of Three hundred thousand Florins,As do also the States of Stiria. besides the One hundred and Sixty thousand, which those States annually pay for Maintenance of their own Charges, both Civil and Military; and of the Militia which is quarter'd on the Confines of Sclavonia. Moreover, Messages were sent to the sever∣al Princes of the Empire, to send their re∣spective Quotas and Contingents, and num∣bers of Soldiers, according to the ancient Constitutions of the Empire: And in the mean time the Imperial Chamber took such due means, and measures in order to the preparations of all things necessary; that Recruits were made, the Artillery mounted, the Magazines filled with Ammunition and Provisions; and all sorts of Carriages, Pon∣tons, Boats, Barges, and all other appoint∣ments for War were provided in great abun∣dance. In the mean time the Garrison of Alba Regalis being reduced to great Extre∣mities, by Famine,Alba Re∣galis in distress. and want of all ne∣cessaries, dispatched away a certain Aga called Achmet, with some few Attendants to Belgrade, there to expose to the Governours of that place, the Miseries of their languish∣ing City. Achmet privately conveying him∣self out of the Town with his Servants, found by chance a small Boat tied on the Banks of the Danube, into which being enter'd,Messengers sent to Bel∣grade. they quietly passed for some Days down the Stream, until they came near to a place cal∣led Erdeody, which had not long before been possessed by the Christians: The Heydukes perceiving the Boat from the Walls, immedi∣ately suspected, that the People therein were Fugitives, then making their Escape; to prevent which, they privately went on Board a Saick or Turkish Vessel, and crossing upon them cut them off in their way; and firing on them with their Muskets, forced them to Steer and Row to the other side; but they following them, made them all Prisoners (Achmet only excepted) who being very nimble and active,Are taken. and a kind of a Bog-trotter, escaped over a Marsh with all his Letters; and fetching a compass out of the way, he came over against Valkowar, which he supposing to be still a Garrison of the Turks,Valkowar. made a Sign for a Boat to Ferry him over the River; the Boat passing over, rowed and manned by Heydukes, seized Achmet, who being surprized to see himself made a Prisoner, and thinking, that they were Turks and not Enemies, cried out; I am a Turk, sent by the Pasha and Garrison of Alba Regalis, with a Verbal Commission only to the Port, denying to have any Letters about him; but they rifling him, found near Three hundred Letters, which were afterwards sent to Vi∣enna, and translated by the Emperor's Inter∣preter. And now Achmet finding it no time longer to conceal his Business, openly de∣clared with Tears in his Eyes, That he was the more troubled for this misfortune, be∣cause that thereby he could not answer the expectation of his Friends at Alba Regalis,Confession of Achmet who had dispeeded him for Belgrade to give an Account to those Governours of their di∣stressed Condition, and according to such Answers, as they should receive from thence, to take a Resolution either to De∣fend or Surrender the Town. He farther added, That thô sometimes certain Hunga∣rian Friends conveyed into the Town some Flour, Pease, Beans and Butter, yet it was in such small Quantities, that all was de∣voured, and the People therein reduced to such Extremites, that in case a small num∣ber of Germans should appear with Cannon before the City, the Bodies of the Garri∣son,
and Inhabitants were become so enfee∣bled by Famine, and their Spirits so low, that without all doubt, they would upon the first Summons Surrender at Discretion: But to give the Reader a more evident Nar∣ration of the Misery of that place, it will not be from our purpose to insert one of the Letters which were taken about Achmet, subscribed by the three Pashas from Alba Re∣galis to the Grand Vizier, in these Terms. After the Complements and Ceremonious words premised, which are commonly long, and full of Bombastick Expressions ac∣cording to the Turkish Stile, they began in this manner: Most happy Lord, IF you enquire after the State of this City, and of the Turkish Soldiers therein, and in the Parts adjacent, all that we can say is, That we recommend theirs and our Condition to the most High God, and to the Pious Compassion of your Excellency; for that after all our Stores of Provision, as well new, as old were consumed, there remained a small quantity of Millet, which tho' it were so old and corrupted, as if it had been laid in, at the first Foundation of the City, yet it was delivered out and distri∣buted amongst the Soldiers; the which being also consumed, there remains not one Grane of any Corn amongst us; so that we are reduced to a most extream, and incredible Extremity: And what is worse, we cannot expect any Re∣lief from the neighbouring parts; for that the Villages round about are revolted to the Ene∣my, who in the last Summer burnt all our Corn upon the Ground; and in the Autumn made themselves Masters of the bordering Pa∣lancaes, or Forts, namely Palotta, Chiocca and Bacchian; so that at present being envi∣roned on all sides by Enemies, we dare not stir abroad, but are forced to contain our selves within the compass of four Walls. And indeed to speak the Truth, we are in that star∣ving Condition, that many have deserted, and above Eight hundred of the Servants of God, have rather chosen to yield themselves Slaves to the Christians, than to die by Hunger; and many of these have renounced our Holy Faith; nor is it possible for us to hinder those, who do daily desert us. Surely, most Pious Lord, The Compassion of our Sovereign is such, as will not permit his innocent People to perish, or to be trampled under the Feet of our Enemies. Most happy Lord, The Giaurs or Infidels, since the taking of Agria, are come to take Winter-quarters in the Castles, and Villages of our Neighbour-hood, and appear every Day in sight of our Gates; and being puffed up with Pride, since the subjection of Agria and Os∣sech, they daily send us Letters and Summons to Surrender; and now lately the third time, we received a most insolent Letter from a certain Captain, who says he belongs to the Religious at Vienna, inviting us to a Sur∣render, promising to Conduct us in safety with our Goods and Families to such places, as we shall desire; Threatning upon our refusal to give us no Quarter, but to put us all to the Sword. And now at last another Messenger is come to us from the Commander of Palotta, whom out of pure Zeal to our Religion, we put to Death with Thousands of Torments: The next Day after which we made a Sally, in which the Giaurs (that is, the Christians) gained the advantage, killing and taking Pri∣soners, One hundred and fifty of our Zaims and Timariots, putting to Death afterwards all those which they had taken; in Revenge of what we had committed on the Messenger, which they had sent to us; and with these, many of our Servants became Martyrs for our Holy Faith; which struck such a terrour into the Minds of our Citizens, Spahees and Jani∣saries, that above Two hundred of them con∣veyed themselves away in one Night. Most valiant Lord, Besides those Letters, which we have sent by divers Conveyances to give a Relation of our most miserable Condi∣tion, we have yet farther to add, that our Souldiers finding themselves desperate, and out of all hopes of Relief and Succour, have sometimes arisen in a Mutiny upon us. For after they had eaten up all the Cattle and Oxen, and Flesh which was in the Magazine, so that an Oke (which is two pounds and a half) of Salt, is sold at four Dollars, and a Bushel of Millet at Twenty four Dollars; in which neces∣sity and Famine, the Soldiers came upon us demanding Pay and Subsistence; saying, That they were obliged to remain only one year in the Town, and that then they should be relie∣ved; but instead thereof, they had been con∣tinued a year and a half in Famine, Naked∣ness, and perpetual danger of their Lives; so that the Janisaries, who are to the number of Three hundred, have rent asunder all the Linings of the Tents for Cloth, and Linnen to cover and defend themselves against the Cold. Wherefore most Honoured, and most Dread Lord; To quiet and appease the just Complaints and Demands of our Soldiery, we have promised that in the space of a Month, they shall receive both Pay and Subsistence: To which purpose, we have dispatched away the Bearer hereof, with some Camerades of his, to present, and expose our Grievances, Wants and Miseries, at the happy and sacred Feet of your Excellency, praying unto God, to Conduct him safe to your most revered Presence. But if notwithstanding all we have said, delay should be made to Succour us with a formidable Army, with Money and Provisions, God knows what will become of us; for in a short time our Business must have an end. If the General of the Emperor should come upon
us, both We, and this City must fall into his Hands. And then neither your Excellency, nor the Port can excuse your selves in saying, That you were not timely advised of our Miseries: For if in the space of a few Weeks we are not relieved, considering the People we have lost, and those which die daily, God knows, you will never see more of our Letters: All depends on your Excellency. Given at Alba Regalis, in the Month of January, 1688. Subscribed, Your Servant Sechoghy Achmet Pasha, called Vizier of Buda: Your Servant Achmet Pasha, Gover∣nour of Alba Regalis: Your Servant Osman Zagargi Pa∣sha, Commander of the Janisaries. Besides this, and several other Letters, which were found about Achmet, the Kadi or Judge of the City, had secretly convey∣ed into his Hands a certain Arz, or Memo∣rial, faithfully representing the Abuses of the Officers, and which was to this effect. OUr most gracious Emperour having sup∣plied our City of Alba Regalis, with plenty of Provisions for Subsistence of the Peo∣ple, one half of them is already consumed and devoured, and the other half hath been frau∣dulently divided between this our Honourable Vizier, and the Zagargibashee, who is Com∣mander of the Garrison, and which they have sold abroad, and put the Money into their own Purses, by Reason of which the poor People are constrained either to perish with Famine, or to Desert, and Fly into the Hands of the Infidels, who are our Enemies: Besides which, to the great Diminution of our Garrison, many of our People have been miserably destroyed in the frequent Sallies which they have made. And because by such Miscarria∣ges as these, the Mussulmin Cause (or Cause of the Believers) doth greatly suffer; I am obli∣ged in Conscience to make known these false, and treacherous dealings, which are the na∣tural effects of Tyranny and Oppression; for as the Alchoran saith, Allânettulach Alla Ze∣limin, which is, let the Curse of God fall up∣on the Head of Tyrants. This Honourable Vizier by his evil Man∣agement of Affairs, and by the insupportable Taxes, which he hath laid upon the Subjects, hath been the cause, why so many of the Ser∣vants of God have been trampled under Foot, and so many Villages laid Wast, and why so many Entire Families, have been necessitated to retire for Protection into the Christian Domini∣ons. In short, his Tyranny and Negligence in the Government hath exterminated the Peo∣ple, and reduced this Garrison to utter Ruin, where at present are scarce Three hundred Persons to be found: And in fine, he is a Tyrant and unfit to Govern with an absolute Authority. One day I adventured to Begin a free Discourse with Achmet Aga, the Bearer hereof, touching all these Miscarriages, in pre∣sence of Osman the Zagargibashee Govern∣our of this place; who therewith was so of∣fended, that he laid his Hand upon his Dag∣ger, and would have killed me. I know not more what to say, since it is the Will of God: And I hope, That what I have here declared will be kindly, and graciously interpreted: And so referring all to your Prudence, I remain; Mustapha Kadi of Alba Regalis. Given at Alba Regalis, in the Month of January, 1688. The truth of these Matters was confir∣med by a Christian, who had lately made an Escape out of Alba Regalis; with this farther Addition, That the Commanders of that Town were so grievously importuned by the Garrison and Inhabitants, that they were resolved to dispatch another party of Turks, amongst which was one Ali Aga, a subtle and dexterous Person, who had been often a Prisoner, and with one Wribech a Renegado, with Instructions to represent the State of their Affairs at Belgrade, and to hasten the desired, and long expected Suc∣cours. Besides which, the Turks were not wanting with all Diligence, Subtlety, and Money to provide what Sustenance they were able, an occasion for which in a short time offered unto them: For Colonel Bi∣sterzi Commander of Palotta, designing to furnish Zioccha with some necessary Provi∣sions; laded four Carts therewith,The Turks of Alba Regalis Seize four Waggons with Pro∣visons. and di∣speeded them away under the Guard, and Conduct of Twenty four Musquetiers; of which the Turks being informed by a trea∣cherous Person, detached that very Night a Party of Two hundred Men, to lie in wait in a Neighbouring Wood, attending the passage of the Waggons, which so for∣tunately succeeded, that they surprized them, and brought them with Twelve Mus∣quetiers of their Convoy into Alba Re∣galis. About this time another Regenado arri∣ved safely in the Town from Belgrade, who gave new Encouragement to the Comman∣ders to hold out, with assurance, that be∣fore he came away the Seraskier had al∣ready provided great abundance of Victu∣als and Money, under a strong Guard,They are encouraged which was on their way towards the City. And moreover he reported, That there were other Succours coming to them from Con∣stantinople,
under such a powerful Convoy as needed not to fear the German Troops, who being sensible of their own Weakness, had abandoned part of their Conquests; as Illoch, Peter Waradin and other Villages, both upon the Save and Danube; so that the Turks having a free Passage, had laid their Bridges over the Save and Drave, de∣signing not only to relieve Alba Regalis, but likewise Sigeth and Canisa. The News which this Messenger had brought, was soon afterwards verified, by an Incursion which some Troops detached from the Regiment of Norcheim had made into the Neighbouring Woods;  into which they had no sooner enter'd, than they found themseves assaulted by a strong party of Turks, who cut off the Heads of divers of those, who were too far advanced; howsoever the rest made their Retreat good by the Assi∣stance of the Governour of Possega, who came in to their assistance; at which time also Seven thousand Turks passed the Save, who rifled all the Villages round, and car∣ried away the People. Means taken to hinder the Succours from Alba Regalis.The Imperial Court being seasonably ad∣vised hereof, took immediate Counsels to prevent and obstruct the Succours designed for Alba Regalis, and to secure the new Conquests from returning again into the Power and Dominion of the Enemy: To which end, Orders were dispeeded from the Counsel of War, to the Regiments quarted in all the adjacent parts about Pesth, to pre∣pare themselves for a March; the like Or∣ders were given to the Regiments of Palfi and Staremberg, as also to some of the Ba∣varian Troops quarter'd in the Counties of Strana and Liptona: Moreover Marshal Caprara received the like Orders, to cause all the Regiments under his Command to March, which lay on the Confines of Croa∣tia: And the like positive Commands were dispatched to the Governours of Croatia; And to all of them Orders were sent to make their Rendezvous in, and about Oseck, so as to be in a readiness to oppose any At∣tempt of the Turks, and to obstruct their passage over the Drave; and prevent their making Semblin a place and Magazine of Arms: by which means all the designs of relieving Alba Regalis, Sigeth and Kanisia were disappointed. Tekeli writes to his Prin∣cess.In the mean time Tekeli not being infor∣med of the Surrender of Mongatz, but sup∣posing it to be much straitned, and in a Condition not to hold out much longer, wrote a Letter to his Princess (which was intercepted) wherein he directs her to pro∣vide in the Articles of Surrender,Febr. 1688. that his Goods and princely Coronet, with those Writings and Commissions given by the Sultan in his favour might be preserved, and permitted to be carried with her; and that for her self and Family, she would do well to dispose of her self and them in Poland, but by no means to commit her Person into the Hands of the Germans, or to abide in any part of the Upper Hungary. But Tekeli hearing that these Orders came too late, and that the Place was already yielded, being full of Anger and Rage, he studied all ways possible to Revenge himself,He wasts the Coun∣tries. wasting and consuming all those fruitful Fields and Coun∣tries, in the parts adjacent as far as Great Waradin; near unto which he had fortified himself with some Thousands of Men, in a certain Village called Thelegh, where Ge∣neral Heusler had some times beaten up his Quarters:  And at length on the 6th of Fe∣bruary,Tekeli de∣feated. passing the River Kerez over the Ice with a strong party of Horse, he fell upon him in his very Trenches, with such Bra∣very and Success, that Tekeli was put to Flight, leaving Six hundred of his Men dead in the Field; and Four hundred Prisoners taken, amongst which was one Genay a Chief Captain, and second in Command to Tekeli himself, together with Twenty other Officers. This Success was followed by another of the like nature: For Tekeli having detached a Party into the County of Zatmar to ga∣ther Contributions, and forcing the same with Fire and Sword, put the poor People into a most miserable Terrour and Conster∣nation, flying from place to place for Refuge and Protection. Upon advice of which, General Heusler hastned with a Party of Horse, encouraged and flushed with the late Victory, happily encountred the Tekelites, as they were carrying away the Spoil, which they had distrained for Non-payment of Contribution; but they not daring to make a stand, quitted their Horses and their Booty, and saved themselves in the Thickets of a neighbouring Wood.General Carafa a Herman∣stadt. At the same time General Carafa was by order of the Empe∣ror dispatched into Transilvania to settle mat∣ters in a better state then before: And be∣ing come to Hermanstadt, he was informed that the German Troops were not provided, and accommodated according to Agreement; whereupon he dispatched a resolute Mes∣sage to Apafi, and the States of the Country, giving them to understand, that in case bet∣ter Provisions were not made for the neces∣sary Quarters of the Soldiers, he should be forced to take such Measures, as were most adequate to the present occasion. Apafi, consi∣dering that Carafa was resolute, and not to be opposed in his Demands, made a vertue of necessity, and sent his Chief Minister Telecky, the most esteemed and most honoured Person of the States and Nobility, unto him, to make him a Complement, with all the high
Expressions of Submission and Compliance. In pursuance whereof the General took into his consideration the particulars of the several Quarters,The Soldiers Allowance in Winter-Quarters increased. and thought fit to advance the Allow∣ance one Third more, than what hath been a∣greed in the former Treaties. And having made some alterations amongst the Officers, belong∣ing to certain Imperial Garrisons, he fixed his own Head-Quarters at Hermanstadt, as be∣ing not only the strongest Garrison, but the most proper and convenient place, from whence he might most easily succour and re∣lieve the other Quarters, as occasion ser∣ved. Halmet yielded.The Name of the Germans was become now so dreadful over all Hungary, that ma∣ny strong Fortresses at the first appearance of the Imperial Forces surrendred them∣selves; as did Halmet, a Castle on the Fron∣tiers of Transilvania, encompassed with a deep and broad Ditch, and furnished with Draw-Bridges, and Garrison'd by Turks, yield up it self to General Magni; who pro∣ceeding forwards in his March, took in the Fortress of Felsiat with as much ease and fa∣cility,Felsiat surrenders. as he had done that of Halmet; by which means he brought above Two hun∣dred Villages under Contribution, and ex∣cluded the Turks from all Communication with the parts of Transilvania. All things being setled in Transilvania to the satisfaction of the Emperor; Baron de Pace was detached with Three Regiments, and reinforced with some other Troops un∣der General Saurau, with Orders to march towards Stephanopolis, a Frontier Garrison of Valachia; to prevent the designs of that Despot in case he should attempt anything to the prejudice of the Emperor: But the Imperial Court being sufficiently satisfied that the Despot had no other but sincere in∣tentions to preserve his own Dominion,  March. The Despot of Valachia submits. and benefit Christendom, His Imperial Majesty was pleased to send the Bishop of Nicopolis unto him, giving him to understand that he should receive his gracious Assistance in all his designs, and that he would cause the Succession of that Principality to descend upon his Son, acknowledging only that Ho∣mage, which from ancient times was paid to the King of Hungary. Whereupon the Despot sent an Envoy to General Carafa at Hermanstadt, to receive Orders and Instructi∣ons in what manner to behave and govern his Affairs. In the mean time the Turks in Alba Re∣galis, finding themselves without all relief, and no returns made to those Messages, which they had dispatched by various ways, began again to be very mutinous,Alba Re∣galis in Mutiny, and un∣ruly towards their Governors; howsoever they still held out, resolving as yet to hearken unto no terms, which should be offered them by the Enemy. Notwithstanding which, the Marquess of Baden, who was President of the Council of War for his Im∣perial Majesty, being commanded to pass from his Government of Javarin, or Rab, unto Ratisbon, there to reside as Plenipoten∣tiary for his Imperial Majesty at that Diet; did think fit, before his departure, to re∣gulate some Affairs within his Jurisdiction; and particularly to appoint Count Ricceardi, accompanied with an Interpreter, and a party of Hungarian Horse, to view and ob∣serve the State of Alba Regalis, and to try if he could incline and persuade the Turks to surrender; but they being quite of another humour, not being reduced as yet to the ut∣most point and extremity of Famine, cryed out with a loud Voice,Denies to surrender. that they would maintain their City to the last drop of Blood; and even to more violent necessities than those of Agria. Ricceardi returning with this report to Giavarin, the Marquess of Ba∣den issued out new Orders to straiten the Town with more rigour and closeness,The Blo∣cade closely watched. than before; and not only reinforced the Castles of Palotta, Zioccha, and Schambegh, warning them to be more diligent and watchful for the future to prevent all Communication between Alba Regalis, and the Neighbour∣ing Villages; and to make the Blocade more formal, General Batthiani was not only commanded to march into those Quarters with his Hungarian Troops, but likewise caused them to be reinforced by some of the Militia belonging to the Circles of Fran∣conia, and other Troops under the Com∣mand of Count Erdeodi, Lieutenant-General at that time of Giavarin: Moreover the Marquess of Baden before his departure, dis∣posed the March of the Militia, and ordered their several Quarters in parts adjacent to Oseck, there to oppose the passage of the E∣nemy over the Drave: After which, all matters being well ordered, with excellent Methods and Rules of Government, the Marquess took Post for Vienna; where having received In∣structions from the Emperor for better Go∣vernment of his Presidency at Ratisbon, he proceeded thither,Marquess of Baden at Ratisbon. and there he held several publick and private Conferences, for the bet∣ter Regulation of the Military Affairs for the Ensuing Campaigne. In the mean time Recruits were made, and Horses provided to Remount such as wanted them; and whilst it was doubted, Whether the Elector of Bavaria could be present in Person to conduct his Army this Year into Hungary, upon a jealousy, that the French would fall into the Palatinate; yet the Treaty was concluded for the Bava∣rian Troops to continue in Hungary, and serve with their best assistance to forward the Pro∣gress of the Imperial Arms.
Mareschal Caprara commanding now in Chief in Hungary, provided Oseck with all things necessary for their Subsistence; and gave Orders to those Captains,C. Caprara commands in Hungary. who com∣manded upon the Save to provide great Numbers of Boats, and Barges, and Floats, for making Bridges over that River, and as occasion served therewith to Transport Pro∣visions and Materials for War. The Turks on the other side had also Erected another Bridge for the better security of Bosnia, and assembled at Costanovitz, on the River Unna, with design to make Incursions into the Con∣fines of Croatia; but that Country was so well guarded and defended by the vigilance of Count Erdeody the Banno, or Chief Go∣vernor thereof, that all attempts of the Turks on that side were wholly disappointed, and defeated: And farther to render the Actions of the Turks fruitless and ineffectual in Scla∣vonia, where they had made Provisions of Victuals and Ammunition, and had laided therewith Lighters and Barges, to supply their smaller Garrisons on the River Save,The designs of the Turks de∣feated in Sclavonia. Baron de Tunkel was dispeeded with a De∣tachment of Two hundred Horse, and a Re∣giment of Dragoons, with some Haiducks to oppose the intentions of the Enemy; and being come as far as Valkovar, the Scouts brought word, that Rustan Pasha, the late Governor of Agria, with about One thou∣sand Horse and Foot, had conducted into Illoch a very great Convoy of about Two hundred Waggons laden with Provisions; and that afterwards he himself was return∣ed unto Belgrade. Tunkel being disappoint∣ed of this Design, was more successful in another Attempt, which he made on a place called Ratza, situate on this side of the Save, defended by some Spahees and Janisaries; to which privately marching in the Night, he surprized the place about Two hours after Midnight, with the Death of about Three hundred Turks, and Seventy Slaves, and set at liberty Fifty Christians, and took Sixty Horses, with great Numbers of Cattle, and Three Ensigns;Ratza ta∣ken from the Turks and burnt and having set Fire to the City, he returned in Safety and Tri∣umph to Oseck, laden with Honour and Spoyls. On the other side the Pasha of Gradisca ha∣ving advice that Count Caprara was upon his march towards Oseck with a strong Party to Conduct and Convoy many Waggons laden with Ammunition and Provisions in order to some extraordinary Enterprize; the Pasha apprehending that his Design might be upon Belgrade, resolved to pass the Bridges which he had laid over the Save, with design to surprize Possega, and Zernech, and thereby to divert the Attack intended upon Belgrade: In pursuance of which the Pasha marched with a Body of Three thousand Five hun∣dred men towards Zernech, but not with that Privacy as Tunkel had lately done; for in their way they set Fire to all the Villages round, and killed the People, which gave such an Alarum to that Garrison, by the affrighted Peasants which had escaped, that they im∣mediately put themselves into a posture of defence: And Colonel Baron Amanzaga ha∣ving also News thereof, hastned with a Body of Horse, and some Foot, and came so sea∣sonably to the succour of the Town, that they encountred the Turks in their march, and charged them with so much bravery, that they not only put the Cavalry to Flight, but also forced them to abandon the Janisa∣ries,Baron Amanzaga defeats the Pasa of Gradisca. and to expose them to the Sword of their Enemies: The greatest part of which, to the Number of about Five hundred, were Slain upon the place, and Two hundred made Prisoners, amongst which was the Commander in Chief of the Janisaries, Four Aga's, and the Son of the Pasha of Gradisca, with several Colours, and Drums: The News of which Baron Amanzaga dispatched to Gene∣ral Caprara with all Expedition. About the same time, or the Day before, another Party detached from the main Body made an Attack upon the Out-guards of Possega, which being over-matched in num∣bers, retreated under the Gates of the City: The Lieutenant Governour, to whom at that time with some veterane Soldiers, and subaltern Officers, the Command of the Town was committed, took the Alarum; but not being cautious enough to be infor∣med of the Strength, and Numbers of the Enemy by the Report of the Out-guards, he advanced too far from the Town; which when the Turks observed, they made a feign∣ed Flight, with design to bring their Enemy into an Ambuscade, which they had pre∣pared for them, in which they had all mis∣carried, had not Count Truxes,The Gar¦rison of Possega seasonably relieved. Lieutenant Colonel of the Regiment of Holstein, and Count Bizzaro, Lieutenant Colonel of the Regiment of Lodron, who (were accidental∣ly marching to relieve the Out-guards,) come seasonably into their Succour and Rescue; who so vigorously charged the Enemy, that they put them to Flight, and forced them to take Refuge in the Woods and Moun∣tains, whilst the Christians, the Night ap∣proaching, retired orderly into Possega. There being in the mean time various Reports at the Imperial Court concerning the State and Condition of the City of Alba Regalis; which holding out so long beyond all expectation, it was conjectur'd, that the Blocade was not strict, or at least not suffici∣ently guarded and watchfully attended as it ought to have been, which obliged the Counsel of War to dispatch Orders to Colo∣nel Riccardi, that he with his Regiment should March to Vesprimio, Palotta, and o∣ther Neighbouring places, to make enquiry
into the State, and Condition of that City and Garrison. Riccardi according to his Orders marched out of Giavarino or Rab;Colonel Ricardi made en∣quiry into the State of Alba Regalis. and taking with him a Company of Croats, and a Party from Schomberg, he came to Quarter for one Night at a Village called Brin, about a League distant from Alba Re∣galis; and early in the Morning by break of day sounding to Horse, in pursuance of his March he detached Ten Croats, and as many Hungarians to advance before, with directions to seize and surprize what Turks they should meet near the City, that by them they might be informed of the State of the place. But they meeting with none on the way, came up to the very Gates of the Town, which they found shut and un∣guarded: But soon afterwards they were opened, to give Passage to the Sally of a Party both of Horse and Foot; the latter of which remained within their Palisadoes; but the first Sallied out into the Field, ha∣ving the Renegado Wrebeck at the head of them, who coming near, frankly discoursed with the Christians in this manner: Soldiers what is it you demand? May a Man trust to your Word? To which Answer was made, That he might; whereupon he came up boldly to them, and touched the Hand of an Hungarian Ensign,Colonel Riccardi desires a parly with the Pasha. and a Rascian: By which time Wrebeck perceiving the numbers of the Enemies to increase, and to approach within Cannon-shot of the Town, he De∣manded, what those Troops were? To which Answer was made, That they were the Troops of a certain Croatian Colonel, who desired to have conference with the Pasha, or with some other of the principal Officers. Wrebeck pro∣mised to carry that Message, and accordingly returned to the City, where at the Gates thereof he met the Pasha of that Country,  with the Commander in Chief of the Jani∣saries, and with two or three other of the principal Officers of that place; to whom he made a Report, that the Troops without were Commanded by a certain Croatian Co∣lonel, who desired to enter into a Confer∣ence with the Pasha: To which the Pasha suddainly replied in these words; It is well, he is welcome, I will go and speak with him. These words being over-heard by the Chief Commander, or Aga of the Janisaries, he arose up in a Fury, and throwing down his Tur∣bant with a Rage upon the Ground, cried out Treachery, and that the Pasha had a Design to betray them into the Hands of the Christians: And Roaring out Treachery, Treachery, he ran to advise the Vizier thereof, whom he found on one of the Bastions, taking a view of the Ene∣mie's Troops in the Field.Jealousies in the Town. The Vizer having heard this saying, Commanded that the Business should be examined, and in case the Pasha should be found Guilty, he should be stoned to Death, and his Body thrown over the Walls. The Pasha being highly incensed upon this so unjust an occasion, took up his Topuss, or Mace into his Hand, and hold∣ing it over the Head of the Aga of the Jani∣saries; said aloud, What is the matter? And what Noise is this thou makest? Thou old Fool? Thinkest thou, that thou art more brave, or more faithful than I am? Hold thy peace, or by the living God, I will beat thy Brains out with this Topuss. For what Rea∣son is it, that I am not permitted to speak with that Captain? Will he alone take this City? Let us hear and see what it is that he will say: If his Offers are good, we may re∣ceive them, and if bad we may reject them. It was never denied in any part of the World to hear Ambassadours. In the mean time a great Noise, and Tu∣mult arose amongst the Soldiers at the Gate, and above a dozen Cannon-shot were fired at the Imperial Horse,A Skir∣mish near the Gates. which stood drawn up within Musquet-shot of the Gates; and some of the Turks mounted on Horse-back made a Sally, and began a Skirmish, which continued almost two Hours, without any other hurt than of some few Turks, who were wounded. Colonel Riccardi all this time could not discover the true State and Condition of the Town; and there∣fore he gave freedom to two Turks, pro∣vided that they would procure entrance in∣to the Town, and return with certain ad∣vice of the true state thereof:An Uproar in the Town. But the Con∣fusion was so great before the Gates, that they were neither permitted to enter, or speak: Whereupon the Colonel seeing little good was to be done, at that present made a Retreat, and was on his return with his Sol∣diers to Palotta; when they espied Wrebeck, with some other Turks running full speed towards them, as if they intended another Skirmish; but they stopped their Horses and returned back to the Town, and so did the Colonel towards Palotta: And having pas∣sed a certain Bog or Morass, and the River Sarowitz, he gave Command to a Turk who was his Prisoner, to go that Night to Alba Regalis; and having there under∣stood the true State of the place, that he should the next day early return with some certain Report thereof:  But the Turk desired to be excused, for that in case he were disco∣vered, he should most certainly be Empaled. But the Colonel fiercely commanded him to go, with promise to give him his Liberty at his return: The poor Fellow obeyed out of fear, and out of Religion to the Faith of his Promise and Oath, he faithfully perfor∣med the Service enjoyned him. For the next Day being the 30th of March, this Turk with Sixteen others well clothed and armed, with four Turkish Women, Wives to some of them, and Children escaped out
of the Town, and fled to the Christians. The Colonel soon enter'd into discourse with them, and by their Answers to several Interrogatories he put to them, he under∣stood, that amongst those Sixteen there were two of them, which in the late Tumult in the City had been principal Ringleaders of the Sedition, the first called Hadgi Ali, and the other Kara Hassan, both of them Offi∣cers amongst the Spahees, and of the num∣ber of those, who had broken the Vizier's Windows, and given some Stabs to the Go∣vernour of the Castle. And to satisfie the Co∣lonel's Questions more particularly, Hadgi Ali gave this following Account of the late Uproar, which had hapned in the Town. A Relati∣on of the Mutiny in the Town of Alba Regalis.On the 27th said he, of this Month of March, some Janisaries and Spahees of the Garrison came to me; and said, Friends and Brethren, what are we to do? These our Commanders will neither Surrender up the City to the Christians, nor yet give us Provisions where∣with to live: Come let us go to these Tyrants, and require an Account from them, for what reason they treat us in this inhuman manner. The Day following, the Spahees and Janisaries, to the number of Four or Five hundred, went with me to the Vizier, with whom we found the Pasha of the City then present; and I, as their chief Speaker, began in sharp and resen∣ting Terms, to lay before them our miserable and starving Condition and Aggrievances. The Vizier and Pasha with gentle, and most obliging words endeavoured to pacifie us, and to lay the blame of all upon the Aga of the Janisaries, advising us to cite him before the Kadi, or Judge, then sitting in the chief Mosch of the City; where being convicted by Justice, they would leave him to our Mercy, to inflict Pu∣nishment on him according to our own free Will and Pleasure: And that their intentions might appear more real and manifest, they gave into my Hands an Order directed to the Judge, to give ear unto the Aggrievances of the People, and to those Accusations which they had to charge on the Aga of the Janisaries. The People here∣with went to the House of the Judge, whom finding not at home, they proceeded directly to the Aga of the Janisaries, who being well pre∣advised of the Business, called me to himself and began to speak to me in very kind words. I know, my dear Hadgi, you desire that the place be yielded up; and for my part I am contented; and if you will let me go to the Vizier and the Pasha, we will soon agree upon Articles for the Surrender. The which we having permit∣ted him to do, he immediately mounted on his Horse; but the enraged People fell upon him, and had killed him, had he not retired back into the Yard of his House, and shut his Gates upon them; and to save himself from farther Out-rage, he barred up himself in a secret place of his House, resolving not to come forth, until he had received assurances for the security of his Life; the which, when I had given him, with consent and approbation of the People, on Condition that he should con∣cur with the Vizier and Pasha in their Re∣solutions for Surrender of the place, he then went to the Vizier and the Pasha; and being all three together, they joyntly agreed to call me to their Presence, and caused me, which was a thing unusual, to sit down amongst them, and demanded of me what it was I desired. I immediately answered: Sirs, My Compani∣ons have entrusted me to tell you, That if you do not Surrender up the City, but suffer them miserably to Perish, they resolve to Kill you, and to do the Business them∣selves, and to depart from hence with their Families to Belgrade. These words being uttered with some fierce∣ness, and accompanied with some other Mena∣ces; they expressed great tenderness for the People, repeating their promises to yield unto all their desires: But I was scarce got out from their presence, before the Gates were with despight shut upon us; and the Commanders shewed themselves armed with all their At∣tendants at the Windows; and the Aga of the Janisaries, who was more resolute than any, and averse to the Surrender, holding his Bow and Arrows in his Hand, told the People plain∣ly, that he would not consent to the Surrender of the City, but would defend and maintain it to the last drop of his Blood. The People enraged hereat, drew up into a Body before the Vizier's House; and some of them ran upon the Walls, and drew from thence two Pieces of Cannon, intending therewith to batter down the Vizier's Palace; which was ready for Execution, when the Renegado Wrebeck, a Fellow very dear to the People, came with Tears in his Eyes, to dissuade them from so violent an Attempt; and having used many very pungent Arguments to them, he prevailed so far, that the Tumult was appeased. During this interval or suspension of Arms, I, who was as it were the Tribune of the Peo∣ple, was called again, and desired to appease the Multitude, promising to answer their de∣sires: But they having been so often deluded, refused to give any Credit to their Words, unless they would solemnly swear on the Alcho∣ran to yield the City; nor yet would they draw off, and return the Cannon unto the Walls, until such time as they had begun to make some steps towards the execution of their desires. Hereupon the three Commanders, with some of the Citizens assembled in the great Mosch, as if they intended to agree upon the Proposi∣tions, which were to be offer'd to the Enemies; but in reality they intended nothing less, la∣bouring all that Day to appease the Tumults with Mony and Provisions: The Vizier made large distributions to the Spahees, and the
Aga to the Janisaries, and the Pasha to the Citizens and Soldiers of the Country; and by these means they took an Oath of the People pa∣tiently to endure, until St. George's Day, be∣ing the 23d of April, which is a Day regard∣by the Turks: But howsoever they would e∣steem themselves absolved from this Oath, in case an Enemy should in the mean time appear before their Walls, and streighten them yet farther by a Siege. Colonel Riccardi having by this Relation been rightly informed of the true State of the Town, he thought fit to make Tryal of another Appearance before the Walls, and came with more than One hundred Horse within Cannon-shot of the place, which had he done the preceeding Day, before the People had taken an Oath to hold out un∣til St. George's Day, the City had most cer∣tainly been yielded: But now instead there∣of, they made several Shots from the Basti∣ons, and sallied out both Horse and Foot, without any other execution on either side, than the taking of one Turk, whose Head they cut off in sight of his Companions. Thus the Colonel having sufficiently been informed of the State of the matter, on which he was employed, he departed from Palotta with his Troops on the 31st of March,  and Lodging that Night within a League of Alba Regalis,Colonel Riccardi leaves Al∣ba Regalis. a certain Ja∣nisary well armed and clothed came to them in the Morning, and gave an Account that he was fled from the City with some other Companions, amongst which was an Odabashee, or Captain of the Janisaries, who having been over active and forward in the late Mutiny, feared in cooler Blood to be cal∣led to question by the angred Officers. After which, Colonel Riccardi finding little farther to be done, marched back to Buda, as Co∣lonel Bisterzi did with his Forces to Palot∣ta. The obstinate Defence which Alba Rega∣lis made, gave some trouble to the Court at Vienna; both because it was necessary to have it subjected before the beginning of the Campaign; and because the Captive Turks and Deserters were so numerous in those parts, and in the Towns and Redoubts over all those Qarters, as might give just occasion of Jealousie and fear of Danger, in case any design of Massacre, or Assassination should be plotted by them: But so vile and mean were the Turks esteemed, and their price and value so low, that a lusty Fellow was sold for a Dollar, and a Woman for a quarter. But we must here take our leave of Alba Regalis for a while, and return to Constanti∣nople, where we shall find the Seditions and Military Mutinies broken out again with more Fury and Danger, even to the very shaking of the Foundations of the Empire, than at the latter end of the last year: For the Cabals daily increased amongst the muti∣nous Soldiers: They had lately received their pay, and were satisfied in all they could de∣mand; their Officers had some of them been displaced, and others strangled, as they were pleased to bestow their Heads and Offices, but not being herewith contented, unless every one of them could be made a Vizier or Pasha,Mutinies begin a∣gain at Constan∣tinople. they were emboldned to proceed to farther Outrages. There had been a kind of a cessation of these intestine Troubles, for about the space of two Months; during which time the new Sultan was per∣suaded as a thing accustomary, to send an Ambassador to France, England and Holland, to give notice of his happy exaltation to the Sublime Throne of his Ancestors; but whilst this was meditating, and preparati∣ons making for carrying on the Wars of the ensuing Summer, which was designed most vigorously to be acted in the Morea, and in a defensive manner only in Hungary, the Thoughts of sending an Ambassador into Christendom, (as lately designed) were laid aside, which was not unpleasing either to Sir William Trumbal, who was then Ambas∣sador for his Majesty of Great Britain at Constantinople, nor yet to the English Com∣pany of Merchants at London trading into the Levant Seas, who could expect to reap nothing but trouble, and expence from such an Embassy. And indeed all things were at a stand by the Insolencies of the Soldiers; the Officers both Civil and Military being discouraged, and at a stop and full Period in the Grand Seignior's Service, had work enough to contrive, how to guard their own Persons against the violence of the Soldiers, and provide for the safety of their own Lives. The daily Cabals of Mutinous Soldiers having been held in several places of the City, were adjourned at length to the Vizier's own House, where with Menaces and great∣er Insolencies than formerly, they demand∣ed the removal of Kuperlee the Chimacam from his Office; saying,Kuperlee laid aside. That he was as bad a Man as his Father, who had spilt Rivers of Blood, and ruined the Empire. It was an unusual Piece of Favour and Mercy in this People to deal thus gently with him, who were accustomed formerly to be Execution∣ers of their own Sentence, upon those, whom they suspected to be no good Wishers to their Side, and Faction. To oppose them herein had been to no purpose, and to expostulate with them had been equally dangerous; wherefore the Vizier being sensible of their Outragious and Irrational Humour, not pa∣tient of the least Contradiction, seemed to concur with them in all they asked, and or∣dered
a Gally immediately to Transport Ku∣perlee to the Castles, on the Hellespont or Dardanelli:He is sent in a Gally to the Ca∣stles. There was no need of Com∣mands, or Force to drive Kuperlee away, for he was affrighted and readily leapt into the Gally, thinking it a happy occasion to save his Life, and escape out of their Hands. The Vizier also at their instance discharged several Officers, which they had nominated, putting the Chief of these Rebels into their places, and renewed a solemn Oath with them to stand by them, and never to be their Enemy; and the Spahees and Janisaries took the same Oath to stand by each other. The Vizier, as a means to amuse the Mu∣tiniers, and to divert their Thoughts to more orderly and lawful designs, set forth the (Tugh) or Horse's Tail, with a Signal of the Vizier's March into the Field within the space of Forty days; but having been for∣ced in this manner to put out Kuperlee his Brother-in-Law (in whom he much confided) from his Office of Chimacam; he knew not any, whom he could more safely trust with the Government of the City, during his absence than Shaban Aga, his own Kaiah, or Deputy in his Business; and to supply his place Zulsicar Effendi was nominated to be Kajah; but very unseasonably, for he was Obnoxi∣ous to the Mutiniers, having been Chiaus∣bashee, and turned out by them; which when one Tesfugee understood (the ablest and a∣ctivest Head amongst them) he came to the Vizier, and insolently told him, that if he made that Man his Kaiah, he would kill him before his Face.The Vizier forced to dissemble. The Vizier still dis∣sembled this Affront, as well as many o∣thers; letting these Rebels run on in their mad and tyrannical Government, until they had render'd themselves universally Odious to the People, which they soon did by their Arbitrary and unequal proceedings; for they framed a Project of raising Chimny-Money,A Zechin is about 9 s. 6 d. of a Zechin yearly on every Chim∣ney; (thô for Popularity it was contrived, that the Rich should pay for the Poor) they also gave out Rules for quartering Sol∣diers, and for levying Money by extraor∣dinary Ways, besides innumerable other Violences and Outrages they committed; all which served to the Vizier's purpose, and hastened the execution of the Designs, which had been contrived between him and Kuperlee, to bring them to destruction; but this could not be compleated without the consent of the new Aga of the Janisaries, with whom the Vizier had prevailed to joyn, and concur with him. Accordingly on Sunday the 19th of Fe∣bruary, a Hatte-sheriff (which is a Royal Command under the Sultan's own Hand wri∣ting) was sent to the Janisar-Aga, who as∣sembling the Chief Officers, read it to them, the Contents whereof were thus; That where∣as the Soldiers having lien under many Grievances, and long Arrears of pay,The Grand Seignior's Command read to the Soldiers. had chosen some of their Body to obtain a re∣dress; which having been granted unto them, and they fully satisfied in all their just Demands, their Duty was now to be Obedient to the Sultan, and to all such as he should appoint to be their Officers, and not to mix in Affairs relating to the Govern∣ment; and that whosoever should be Refra∣ctory should be punished as a Rebel. The Hattee-sheriff being read, the Janisar-Aga asked them, whether they would be obedi∣ent to the Royal Command? To which the Officers (for none but the inferiour Soldiers joyned with the Mutiniers) answered, Yes.Tesfagee refuses to obey; But Tesfagee cryed out, That he was a Villain, and a Rascal who obeyed that Order. Whereupon the Janisar-Aga calling him Traytor and Infidel, caused him to be carried into an Inner-room, where he was killed,And is kil∣led. and his Body thrown out before the Gate. After this, the Janisar-Aga went to the Vizier to give him an account of this Action and Success, with which the Vizier could not but be well pleased, thinking the Business to be ended: And indeed it was a good step to it, for this Tesfagee was the principal Instrument to keep the Spahees and Janisaries united, and the boldest, and most understanding Villain amongst them. And now as if the Game had been sure, the Vizier sent the Tefterdar to Seal up his House in order to a Confiscation of his Estate, and also the Houses of several others of the Chief Mutiniers: But herein the Vizier made a false step, for he should have secu∣red their Persons, before he had sealed their Houses. For hereupon Hadgi Ali (who was an in∣timate Companion of him who was killed) fearing the same Fate, presently advised the rest of the Mutiniers hereof, and stirred up the Janisaries, by minding them of the ma∣ny Oaths they had taken with the Spahees to stand by each other: They assembled at Atmeidan, or rather Okmeidan,Hadgi Ali another Mutinous Fellow. which is a Field without the City, where they used to Shoot with Bows and Arrows. The Jani∣sar-Aga hearing of the Assembly, and think∣ing by his Authority to disperse, and ap∣pease it, enter'd boldly into the Field; whom when Hadgi Ali espied, he made up to him, and told him,Kills the Aga of the Janisaries. You have Murther'd our Companion, and endeavoured to sow Dissen∣tions amongst us; and striking him on the Head with his Scymeter, he was immediately cut to pieces. This Man was an Armenian Renegado; and as it is said, he was after his Death found to be uncircumcised. After this the Tumult increased; and then they went to the Tefterdar's House, and ransacked
it, taking away a considerable Sum of Money,The Tumult increases. which was prepared and laid up for the Soldiers Pay: From thence they went, and assaulted the Vizier in his own House, where he defended himself valiantly; for having got to himself the Tefterdar, the Captain Pasha, and a considerable number of Friends and Servants all well armed, he re∣pulsed them thence. At last, thinking to pacifie them by the Resignation of his Office (which was a very great Error) he sent for the Mufti, who out of fear was joyned with the Mutiniers.The Vizier gives up the Seals. He gave up the Seals into his Hands, desiring him to carry them to the Grand Seignior, that he might consti∣tute another Vizier more pleasing, and more capable to Rule his People. This false step dis∣heartned all his Friends and Associats, finding him devested of all his Authority and Power; the Tefterdar and Captain Pasha gave way also to the Fury of the Soldiery, and made their Escapes: And the Mutiniers being hereby encouraged, and not in the least soft∣ned by this Resignation, fell on more fierce∣ly, and broke into the House of the Vizier, who retiring by a Back-stairs, was pursued by Hadgi Ali, and shot with a Pistol, and by others wounded in the Belly, so that his Guts came out:He is kil∣led. He had fought couragi∣ously, having slain several with his own Hand: His Friends would have persuaded him to withdraw himself; But they could not prevail upon him, saying, That he could not live long, and that during his short life, he would not abandon his Wife, and Children to the Fury of these Miscreants. Above Fifty Soldiers were kil∣led before they enter'd the House, which they spoiled even to the Windows and Doors. His Wife (the Daughter of Old Kuperlee) gave them all her Jewels; but they treated her inhumanly, and wounded her; upon which, as then reported, she Miscar∣ried of a Child and died:His Wife, House, &c. ransacked. The eldest Daugh∣ter not delivering her Pendants soon enough, they cut off her Ears with them; and a younger Daughter with a Slave, they took away, and sold for six Dollars. This Tumult lasted three or four Days, when the Rebels seemed to be absolute Masters; for there was now no Vizier, no Janisar-Aga,Great con∣fusion. nor any surviving, who had any Authority over them; when a small Accident ruined these Men, and over-turn∣ed their Anarchy, which was impossible to last: For after they had domineer'd for the space of five Months, Pardoning or Killing, Raising or Destroying whom they pleased; it hapned, that in some of the Shops of the City, four of these Janisaries in the Morn∣ing had taken away some Embroider'd Hand∣kerchiefs, and other small Commodities which remained there to be Sold; upon which a great Cry, and Clamour being raised a∣mongst the Shop-keepers, by the Encour∣agement of an Emir they all arose,The ruin of the Muti∣niers from whence. fell on them, and killed two of them; and then the Emir putting a Linnen-cloth on a Stick, and lifting it up cried out, Let all true Mus∣selmen come to the Seraglio, and pray the Grand Seignior to put out the Prophet's Stan∣dard and destroy these Rebels: Upon this, great numbers of the Citizens, who had been highly incensed by their Robberies and Insolence, got in a Body together and went to the Seraglio, which so encouraged the Sultan and those within, that the Stan∣dard was set forth about Noon, and Procla∣mation made in the Streets, for all People to come and Fight under it.Mahomet's Standard spread. The Rever∣ence paid to this Standard, brought an in∣credible concourse of People of all Condi∣tions and Ages, under the Walls of the Seraglio; from whence a Shegh, or Preacher called to them thrice, and asked them, Whe∣ther they were contented with their pre∣sent Emperor? To which, Answer was made in the Affirmative, with three great Shouts; but that they would have the Giurbaes, or Cap∣tains, or Ringleaders of the Mutinous Mili∣tia destroyed: Upon which, Orders were given to seize them: Accordingly Thirteen of them were taken and cut to pieces; the rest fled or absconded. The Mufti also, who had sided with the Giurbaes, was depri∣ved of his Office, and Tabac Effendi put into his place, who had formerly been deposed by the unruly Soldiers: All that night a strong Watch was set about the Seraglio, and the next day all was quieted, as if none of these Disturbances had hapned:The Sedi∣tion sup∣pressed. Only Pro∣clamation was made to Search for the Re∣bels, of which, as many as were found, were immediately executed. Upon this Re∣volution, and Turn of Affairs all the great Officers were changed: The Nisangi-Pasha who was an old Man, and for many years had done nothing else, but make the Grand Seignior's Firm on Commands, was created Grand Vizier: And a very young Man,  the fifth Page of the R. Chamber, whose Of∣fice it is to cover the Grand Seignior's Ta∣ble, was made Aga of the Janisaries: Se∣veral Armenians, who dressed in the Habit of Soldiers, had mixed with the Tumults, and plunder'd the Houses of the late Grand Vizier, and Aga of the Janisaries,Divers punished. were taken and hanged, and several others were Im∣prisoned upon Suspition of confederacy with the Rebels. In fine, upon Proclamation made, that whosoever had plunder'd any thing from any of the aforesaid Houses, and should restore the same again in the space of three days, should obtain his Pardon; which had so good effect, that several Sums of Money, were either brought to the new
Vizier, or in the night time laid in the Streets, and next morning restored. And now from this day only may we begin to account the Reign of this new Sultan: Who in the first place to exercise his Autho∣rity, by a strict reformation of things, he suppressed Taverns, and prohibited the ta∣king of Tobacco: And to observe what ef∣fect his Authority had taken; he walked one day Incognito in the Streets, with a∣bout eight Servants at a short distance from him,The Sultan takes up∣on him to govern. and finding two poor Fellows selling Tobacco, he caused them immediately to be executed. The suppression of this dread∣ful Mutiny and Rebellion, produced a ge∣neral Joy and Jubily over the whole City, and served to bring the Soldiery again in∣to their Wits, who had for some Months, like so many Wild and Ravenous Beasts, getting the Bridle out of their Mouths, a∣cted without Reason or Common-Sense. For one would have thought that Men, so lately mortified by the Victories and Suc∣cesses, which their Enemies had gained o∣ver them, should not thereby grow, or be∣come more insolent; or that they who fled before their Enemies, should blush to abandon their Frontiers, and leave them naked and exposed, whilst they marched Five or Six hundred Miles homewards, to reak their Anger on their Commanders, and exercise the little Courage which was left them, against their Citizens and Country-men. But many times we read, that such Turbulences as these, which are like Fevers in the Body Po∣litick, have served to render the whole Com∣position afterwards more healthful, being thereby purged of many corrupt and ma∣lignant Humours. And so it hapned in this case; for after the Death of Sciaus Pasha, and the destru∣ction of the Giurbas, it hapened fortunate∣ly for the present Vizier Ismael, that there was no Pasha then in view, on whom to confer this Sublime Office. After which no eminent Men appearing, and of years fitter to support the weight of so great a Charge, then Ismael,Ismael mad Vi∣zierr by Chance. who was almost arrived to the Age of Fourscore; it was proposed, that he should descend to the Trust of Chimacam: But Ismael rejected that employment, say∣ing, That in such turbulent Times he could not act with Vigour and Authority, requi∣site for composing the present distractions, and securing the Peace and Quiet of the Empire, unless he were invested with the Supreme Power and the Seal of Vizier, which in that present Exigency was granted to him: But he having never made any Figure in the World before, and this ad∣vancement to so high a Dignity being very accidental, it was really believed, that it could not be of any long continuance, and that he was rather designed to supply the Vacancy, than possess the Office. But in a few days Ismael discovered to the World,March 1688. that his intentions were not to keep the place warm for another, but to settle him∣self; and for his own greater security and quiet of the City, he immediately fell to purge with great severity the dregs of those ill Humours, which had disturbed the Go∣vernment. And so he caused all the chief Servants of the Giurbas, and several of the Spahees, and Janisaries (who had sided with them) every Night to be cut off and thrown into the Sea, to the Number of about a Thousand, by which the rest being terrified, the Soldiers were reduced to as exact an Obedience, as formerly. To proceed farther in this Work, the Tefterdar, or Lord-Treasurer, who was first put in by the Giurbas (thô afterwards they would have killed him) was imprisoned in the Middle-gate of the Seraglio, and all his Estate seized: Then was the Kia bei, or Lieutenant-General of the Janisaries snt for, and vested by the Vizier as a Pasha;The Vizier endavours to settle himslf. but so soon as he was gone out, he was seized, imprisoned, and privately conveyed away in a Boat, and banished to Mytilene. The reason why the Grand Vizier made him a Pasha, was because that according to the Constitution of the Janisaries, and that An∣cient Cannon, no Kia-bei, whilst so, can be put to Death, or Banished, until he is first divested of that Office. And now Kuperlee, who, as formerly men∣tioned, was sent away to the Castles at the Dardanelli, began to come into remembrance,Kuperles sent to Canea. and to be looked on by the Vizier as his Rival, and a dangerous Competitor, and as such, to be too near the Port: Wherefore to remove him farther off, a Gally was or∣dered to Transport him to Canea, and the same Gally in her return to take Mustapha Pasha, the late Janisar-Aga, who was not long since banished to Canea, and bring him back to the Dardanelli. And farther to purge the Army of all Mu∣tiniers, and punish them for their late Sedi∣tion, several of the chief Giurbas were ta∣ken, strangled, and their Bodies thrown out before the Gate of the Seraglio. Shaban Aga, the Kaiah, or Deputy of Siaus Pasha, late Vizier, and his Hafnadar, or Treasurer, were imprisoned to make a discovery of the Estate belonging to Siaus Pasha, their Ma∣ster; in Composition for which, upon pay∣ment of One hundred and twenty Purses,Several Imprison∣ed, and Fined. they were set at liberty. Shaban Aga the Customer was also seized, and Three hun∣dred Purses demanded of him; but he ha∣ving been so often fleeced, and squeezed in all Turns, declared himself unable, and so was continued in his Imprisonment.
In the mean Yeghen, the famous Robber in Asia, who having the last Year brought with him Fifteen hundred men into Hunga∣ria, was for that reason made a Pasha, by Solomon then Vizier; and for want of bet∣ter Officers,Yeghen Bei com∣mits some outrages. the Command of the Turkish Forces on the Frontiers of Hungaria were now committed to his Conduct: But being a Man always used to Rapine, and Violence, he could not cast off the Trade to which he was accustomed, but fell in upon the Coun∣try of one Zeni the Pasha of Albania, which he plundered, and pillaged on all sides where he came, raising great Sums with all man∣ner of Oppression, by the Force and Vio∣lence of his Soldiers; which Zeni not en∣during, opposed and beat them away. Whereupon Yeghen made great Complaints to the Port; and Zeni not knowing what impressions they might make in the minds of the Great Men,Pasha of Bosnia strangled. appeared in Person at Con∣stantinople to make his defence; but so low-spirited were the Ministers at that time, that for fear of Yeghen, they gave up Zeni to be strangled by him. This Zeni was an Albanian by Birth, and of good interest in his Country, and always bred up to the Wars, and esteemed a brave Soldier; and being now sentenced to Dye, he made it his earnest desire, that he might be sent against the Grand Seignior's Enemies, that he might Dye in the midst of them with his Sword in his Hand; but he was to be Sa∣crificed to the base and rapacious Spirit of a Robber; for to so vile and mean a Degree was the Greatness and Authority of this Empire fallen. It being now the Month of March, when it was high time to form an Army with all Provisions of War for the Campaigne, fre∣quent Consultations were held thereupon in the Divan. The New Vizier, as to him∣self, was for several reasons unwilling to re∣move from the Court to the Camp; For he was very poor when he came first to that Office: And thô the Conjuncture was fa∣vourable, when he was at first advanced to it, all Offices being then new Farmed, and let out through the whole Empire, which brought him at least a Thousand Purses of Money; yet the Equipage of a Grand Vi∣zier for the War was vast, and to one in his condition wholly disfurnished of Tents,The Grand Vizier makes ex∣cuse for not going to the War. Horses, Camels, Mules, &c. would be un∣supportable: And this gave him a fair pre∣tence to excuse himself from going this Year to the Wars: Nor indeed was it his interest so soon to absent himself from the Grand Seignior's Presence, until he had setled himself in his Favour and Acquaint∣ance, and introduced his own Creatures. Moreover his Age was great, and his Ex∣perience in the War little; the Preparations for the War, by reason of the late Distra∣ctions, and Intestine Troubles, Divisions, and all kinds of ill-management, were be∣come very inconsiderable; so that it was not without favour to the Vizier given out, that it was not for the Reputation of the Grand Seignior's Seal, and the Safety and Honour of the Prophet's Standard to be so meanly attended. Whereupon it was con∣cluded to make Yeghen a Vizier of the Bench,Yeghen intrusted with the Army. to send him Three Horse-tails, and con∣stitute him Sardar, or Major-General in Hungary. All this while Yeghen had not been idle, but had pursued his point of raising Monies by all manner of Extortions, and at last very confidently wrote a Letter to the Vi∣zier; importing, That in case any Letters should have been wrote to the Port, con∣taining Complaints of his having raised great Sums upon the People; he desired the Vi∣zier to peruse the Account, whereby he would find that the Sums he had raised, did almost amount unto One thousand Purses, which he had employed to the payment of his Soldiers,  and to provide them with Necessa∣ries,He de∣mands Money. desiring that One thousand Purses more might be forthwith sent him to pay off the remaining Arrears of the Army, which would serve to keep the Soldiers in Order, and Obedience, and put both him∣self and them in a convenient posture for the War. But the Vizier was not very forward to send him supplies of Money, having taken a jealousy, that by his various motions he in∣tended to set up for himself; for many of his Ancient Comrades came daily flocking over to him, and some privately from Asia;The Vizier answers not. and therefore designed to remove him as far off from him, as he could, and give him his Hands full of business with the Germans. Soon after which, this Yeghen sent his Steward or Kaiah, named Kara Mustapha, with Letters to the Grand Vizier, recom∣mending the Kaiah to be made Pasha of Caramania, and that he might have Orders to forward the Asiatick Levies for the War.  This the Vizier dissembled and granted; and accordingly whilst his Kaiah was pre∣paring an Equipage for his Government, other Letters came from Yeghen, demanding more Money and Soldiers, with the Standard of Mahomet, and a power to dispose of all the Offices, and Pashalucks,Yeghen demands the Grand Seignior's Seals. or Govern∣ment of Pashas in those parts, adding that it was very fit the Grand Seignior's Seals should be in the Army, as necessary to up∣hold the Authority of a General, and keep the Soldiers in due obedience. This spoke so plain his intention of setting up for Grand Vizier, That a Great Council was con∣vened, where it was agreed to take from
him even the Office and Title of Sardar; and bestowing on him the Title only of Pasha of Temiswar,But is de∣graded. Hasnadar, or Treasurer, Hassan Pasha was again made Seraskier in the Room of Yeghen. To execute this re∣solution with more Authority, Five Kapi∣gibashees were dispatched, with Orders and Instructions, That in case Yeghen would not accept of the Government of Temiswar, and refuse quietly to repair thither; then they were by vertue of a Royal Command un∣der Signature of the Grand Seignior, di∣rected to the Bostangibashees at Adrianople, and in all parts of Romelia to raise the Ne∣firan, or Trained-Bands of those Countries upon him. And to prevent the passage of Yeghen into Asia, where by joyning with a Body of Thieves, and Robbers, and Male∣contents of his Party, he might cause great Commotions, the Ways were all laid with Forces to prevent and obstruct his Passage: And that his Kaiah neither, might not be permitted to pass into Asia to prepare Com∣motions against the coming of his Master; the Gates of Constantinople were shut, and Guards set, not to suffer any to go out of the City. But the Kaiah, upon the Ru∣mour hereof, surrendered himself that Even∣ing to the Grand Vizier, and had imme∣diately been strangled, had not the Mufti vigorously interposed in his behalf, alledg∣ing, That it would appear more just and reasonable to secure his person for the pre∣sent, and to stay, and to see what effects the Grand Seignior's Orders would have upon Yeghen his Master. These Rumours raised once again new fears and distractions at Constantinople; for Reports flew about,New fears in the City from Yeghen. that Yeghen was on his march towards the City, where he had a strong Party amongst the Giurbas, and others, giving out that he came to restore Sultan Mahomet, or his Son, to the Throne, all which being Fore-runners of a New Civil War, moved many rich Turks to leave the City, and some of them to retire to Grand Cairo, the Sanctuary of Rich and Opulent Turks. The Vizier in the mean time to ob∣struct his March, sent Ten or Twelve Cham∣bers of Janisaries, with several Pieces of Cannon to guard an important Pass, called Mustapha Pasha's Bridge, upon a River in the Marshes, about Six Hours Journey from Adrianople: And lest he should have ano∣ther design in his Head of passing over into Asia, at the narrow Streight of the Hel∣lespont, Merza Pasha was sent with other Janisaries to Gallipoli, where it was proba∣ble he might attempt a passage, it being re∣ported, that he had already sent Four hun∣dred Purses, with many of his People by that way. All his Force was reported to consist only of Four thousand Horse; and it was hoped by the Grand Vizier, and other Chief Commanders, that many of these would desert also; and that all the Country of Romelia, which had miserably been harassed by him, and that the Great Men, who mortally hated him, would una∣nimously rise to suppress, and reduce him to Subjection. During all these intestine Embroils,  no care was taken to oppose the Foreign and Common Enemy, all being abandoned to their Lust, until they could see an end of the Civil Wars. From whence we may learn, That no Faith or Trust is to be gi∣ven to Robbers, and Highway-men, like these; for thô they may by fair words, and specious pretences, come in to the assist∣ance of a Prince, their design is to set up for themselves, and set only on Mischief, on Rapine, on Violence, which their Edu∣cation had made natural unto them. Still did the Apprehensions, and intestine Disturbances from Yeghen daily increase;Ismael the Vizier undermi∣ned. and Ismael the Vizier being found to be a Person of ill Qualities, Proud, Obstinate, and ex∣tremely Avaritious, besides his small pra∣ctice in Affairs; the Mufti, together with the Chief Men of the Law and Sword, gave privately by the hands of the Kuzlir-Aga, an Arz, or Memorial to the Grand Seignior, representing that they thought themselves obliged in Duty, humbly to make known unto him, that Ismael Pasha was not a fit man to continue Vizier: That such difficult times, as these, required one of the greatest Abilities, and Experience; and that none was better qualified to con∣tend with the dangerous Troubles and Com∣motions, than Mustapha Pasha, at present an Exile at the Castles of the Dardanelli. The Grand Seignior presently agreed to the Counsel, and dispatched a Hatte-Sheriff, or Royal Command to Mustapha Pasha, to repair to his presence; which he accordingly did; and the next Morning after his Arrival,  he visited the Grand Vizier;Mustapha Pasa sent for. who being in∣formed that Mustapha was sent for to be made Vizier of the Bench, and to be an As∣sistant to him in his Counsels, for the better Composure of the disturbed Estate of the Empire, he vested him with a Vest of Sa∣bles, as a Vizier of the Bench, and Com∣panion with him, to bear a share of the heavy burthen of the Government. The Vizier also designed to move the Grand Seignior to employ him in the Command of the Army, in the place of Teghen; for which Office he was very proper, be∣ing well beloved in the Army, and in high Reputation both of the Spahees and Ja∣nisaries. But the Vizier had but flattered himself with all these Measures; for coming one
Morning from the Divan, and being sate down at his Table to Eat, in came the Bal∣tagee Kiasei, or Lieutenant of the Guard of the Battle-axes, and delivered a Hatte-Sheriff, or Royal Command from the Sultan, to deliver up the Seals, which he immediately did;Mustapha mae Vizier. and the same being carried to the Grand Seignior, he sent for Mustapha, and gave them to him, vesting him with the Ceremonies usual at the Creation of a Grand Vizier. After which, the first thing which Musta∣pha did, was to dispatch away several Cou∣riers to Yeghen, and to the Pashas in those parts to countermand the Orders formerly sent; but before those Advices could arrive, a Messenger came with Letters from Yeghen to Ismael,Yeghen writes to Ismael and the Mufti. and the Mufti, acquainting them, That since the Nefran, or Trained-Bands had by their Orders been raised upon him, and encompassed him round on all sides in the Plains near Sophia, where he lay En∣camped, but durst not attack him; (for if they did, he resolved to sell his Life dear, as he had declared to those, who came to take him) therefore he protested against the Vizier, and Mufti for all the Mussel∣man Blood, which should be spilt in that quarrel. He also desired the Pashas, who came against him, to have patience only un∣til an Answer was returned to those Letters which he was then sending to the Port, and to give them free passage. In his Letters he seemed to wonder much, what should be the cause of this Commotion, he for his part having done nothing contrary to his Duty, or his Allegiance to his Prince; and there∣fore could not believe, that it was the Grand Seignior's Will and Pleasure that these Arms should be raised upon him; but if it were, he would go, and lay his Head at his Feet, who might take it, if he pleased, but he would deliver it no other person. Mustapha, now Vizier, having received the Letters, read them, and said to the Mes∣senger, who brought them, Cursed be he who was the cause of this disturbance: But how∣soever he said that all should end well; for that he had already dispatched Orders for pacifying and composing all things, and would next day return him back with a Confirmation of the former dispatch. Ismael being now laid aside,Mustapha Vizier an∣swers Yeghens Letter. Ismael blamed. and out of Power and Office, was to bear the Burthen of all the Misfortunes; for that Yeghen Writing, in case he had not more Men and Money, he could not advance farther against the Enemy, but should be forced to return to Constanti∣nople. Ismael had taken the Alarum, and raised the Country upon him without just or reasonable Apprehensions of any danger from a force so small and inconsiderable, as that of Yeghen's, they consisting of no greater a Number, than that of Four thousand men. But the Truth was, Ismael had great reason to apprehend the danger of the approach of Yeghen to the Port; for he was a dangerous Villain; and thô his Numbers were not great, yet they might be formidable when joyned to the Faction and Friends of the Giurbas, and the Male-contented Party which lay con∣cealed, and under Covert in the City of Constantinople. But now new Masters, new Measures; and Yeghen was to be Courted by Letters from the Vizier, declaring that the Sultan highly esteemed his Fidelity and Bravery; and had pardoned him; and that now he should return to the Frontiers, and cheerfully attend the Service of the Sultan: As to his Kaiah he was continued in the Office, with the Title of Pasha of Caramania; but was ordered to supply his Government with a Musselim, or Deputy, but he him∣self was ordered to serve in the War. And now after these dispatches, Ismael was called upon to Réfund the Monies,Ismael Fined. which he had raised from Pashas, and other Officers for their places; which were valued to amount unto One thousand Purses; but he made his Composition, and paid to the Tefterdar or Treasurer Five hundred only. Thus had the Civil Dissentions taken up all their time, and obstructed the due Pre∣parations for a War so pressing and heavy upon them; so that little could be expected of great Action in Hungary, the Season of the Year (which was now April) being far advanced: Howsoever great things were ex∣pected from the Wise and Valorous Conduct of this New Vizier Mustapha,  having for his Merit been raised from a common Soldier to be a General.May He had been Janisar-Aga at the Siege of Vienna, and afterwards Seraskier at the first Siege of Buda, and was for a while in great Reputation with all People, both Civil and Military. But this favourable Air of the People did not continue long; for Mustapha by his In∣disposition of Body, and the continual Di∣stractions and Difficulties of the Times, seemed not to answer the great expectation which was at first conceived of him; and indeed the Confusions and Fears of the Peo∣ple, grew always higher and greater as Dangers approached nearer; to increase which, there wanted not evil Spirits to pos∣sess and affect the minds of the Vulgar with hideous Stories and Reports;Fears and terrible Reports at Constan∣tinople. and indeed as for some of them, there wanted not proba∣ble Reasons, or substantial Foundation. The News of the Revolutions at Grand Cairo took up a greatpart of the Discourse; the Truth of which came afterwards to Light, and known to be no other, but a discontent of the People raised upon a Belief, that the
Vizier intended to change the Pasha, which had but four Months before been entred into his Office: Upon which Report, after many Consultations held at Grand Cairo, they resolved to send several of their Beys, or Lords, as Deputies to represent unto the Vizier, that besides the great Tax laid upon the Country at the entrance of every new Pasha, it was contrary to the Priviledges, and Constitutions of Egypt,Deputies sent from Grand Cairo. that their Pasha should be changed before the expiration of three years; the which they supplicated the Vizier to consider, and to lay these their Desires and Reasons before the Grand Seig∣nior. The Vizier at first answered them very roughly, and with Anger, telling them that this Message which they brought arose from Humours and Seeds of Mutiny and Sedition, and the Contagion they had re∣ceived from the Rebellious Giurbas; That they undertook to meddle in matters, which did not concern them; that they were the Grand Seignior's Subjects, and therefore ought quietly to submit, to whom soever it was his Imperial pleasure to set over them. But in a few days afterwards, upon cooler Thoughts, and Reflections on the present disorder of the Government, it not being judged convenient to discontent or provoke this People;They are dispatched back a∣gain. he called again for the Depu∣ties, and dismist them with a confirmation of the same Pasha, and so dispatched them back again to Grand Cairo with full satisfaction. But that which gave most trouble, was certain Advice, that in Asia great numbers of Thieves and Robbers infested the Country, and that a Body of about Four thousand Men had appeared before Angora; the Head, or Chief Commander of which was one Yedic,Robbers in Asia trou∣ble the Country. under whom Yeghen had served as a Captain, before he came into the Grand Seignior's Service; he was a bold and an old Robber, who had long lived on Rapine and Spoil, and now commanding so consi∣derable a Body of Horse, he ravaged all the Country, commanding free Quarters every where, and raising Contributions and Taxes in all places according to his own Lust and Pleasure; and hearing what suc∣cess Yeghen his Under-Officer had gained, he was willing to put in for a share with the rest; offering himself and Forces to come over into Europe, and serve the Grand Seig∣nior in the Wars of Hungary. About the same time also there hapned a Combustion in Candia, where the Soldiers mutined for want of Pay, and killed their Pasha, with the Aga of the Janisaries, and some others,Mutinies in Candia. seizing on the Pasha's Estate, which was accounted to amount unto so much Money, as would pay the Soldiers all that was due to them. Whereupon the Grand Vizier created Kuperlee-Ogle, lately banished thither (as we have mentioned) Pasha of that Country, and the Moxur Aga or Major General of the Janisaries, to be Aga of the Janisaries in the places of those, who were lately killed in the Tumult, and likewise dispatched from Constantinople Ali Pasha, who was once a Creature of Kara Mustapha Pasha late Vizier, to be Pasha of Canea; by which means the Vizier freed himself of two dangerous Competitors. In the mean time Ismael Pasha the late Vizier was sent on a Gally to guard Cavalla,Ismael banished. a Castle near Salonica, which in effect was no other than an Honourable Banishment: And because the Grand Seignior was not pleased to accept the offer made to him by Yedic, a Teftirgee Pasha, with some other or∣dinary Pashas,Yedic was to be sup∣pressed. were dispatched into Anato∣lia, to settle and secure the Country, and to reduce Yedic, and the Thieves his Com∣plices to Obedience. The Grand Vizier now according to the Custom of all his Predecessors, that he might settle himself more firm, began to make se∣veral changes in the Officers; amongst o∣thers, he put out Ramadam Effendi, Lord Treasurer in the late time of Ismael, placing in his stead Mahomet Effendi, Treasurer in the time, when the Giurbaes governed; an ill Man, and of a bad Reputation. Nor could the Vizier think himself se∣cure whilst Yeghen Command his Forces, so near as Sophia, and was disobedient to all Commands, aspiring to no less, than to be Seraskier or General of the Army; nor could it be thought, he would stop there, or at any other point until he came to be Grand Vizier: Wherefore Mustapha Vizier, dis∣patched private Orders to have Yeghen strangled; who remained hovering about, between Belgrade and Sophia, keeping all Strangers from any near approach, so that the execution of those Orders were respited, until a more opportune conjuncture:Yeghen continues in Rebel∣lion. For he continued still in Rebellion, having refused to go to Bosna, declaring that he would not give up the Command of Seraskier of the Ar∣my in Hungary, to Hassan Pasha, or any other. Whilst these things were in Agitation, an Envoy arrived at Constantinople from the Emperor of Morocco, with Letters of Com∣plement to the Grand Seignior upon his Ex∣altion to the Throne, and with Offers,  that as the Christians were united toge∣ther against the Musulmen, so he was ready to give his Assistance to the Grand Seignior in defence of the Mahometan Faith. It being now the Spring time, when the Turks always put their Horses out to Grass and Soil: The Imbrahor, or Master of the Horse, invited the Grand Seignior into the Fields, to see in what order his Horses were governed at their Pasture; and there
gave him a very Splendid Entertainment. The Grand Seignior was so pleased with the Dinner, the Air, and the Fields, that in two or three days afterwards he went again to the Meadows at Cat-Hanah,The People displeased with the New Sul∣tan. about, two English Miles at farthest from Pera; where he was again feasted, not without the Cen∣sure and Murmuring, of the People; who said, That in a short time he would follow the Example of the late Sultan in his Diver∣sions, and Negligence in the Government, so they should have changed (as indeed they had) to little purpose. It began now plainly to appear, That the Turks by reason of their intestine Divisions, had made very inconsiderable Preparations either by Land or Sea:  Howsoever some∣thing was necessary to be; and therefore in the first place, Eleven Gallies were sent to Guard the Black Sea against the Cosacks, who (as was reported) were preparing to make Incursions into the Parts near Constan∣tinople, as they had usually done in former times. The Turks make small Prepara∣tions.But their chief Apprehensions and Fears were raised from a Report, that the Imperi∣alists were marching towards Belgrade: And indeed they had great Reasons for it; for they had nothing of Force on the Frontiers, nor nothing to oppose them in case the Em∣peror should think fit to push forward his Conquests, which nothing could obstruct, besides Famine and Hunger in a March through a ruined, and a desart Country. The Turks in these extremities, finding no safety or success, and protection in their Arms, had recourse to their last refuge, which was, if possible to obtain a Peace with the Emperor,They seek for Peace. a Method, which they had never practised before since they were an Empire, to be the first to Sue for a Peace. But now Necessity pressing them, they were for dis∣patching an Ambassador to the Kings of France,An Ambas∣sador de∣signed for England. England, and the States of Holland, whose design, substance and main drift of his Embassy was only pretended to give notice unto those Powers of the Exaltation of Sultan Solyman to the Throne of the Ot∣toman Empire: But with private Instructi∣ons to insinuate unto those Princes severally to interpose in a Mediation of Peace, and to use their endeavours to give a stop to the Career of the Imperial Arms; which good Offices, in order to a Peace might reasona∣bly be expected from Kings and Princes, who had for many years maintained a hap∣py Peace, and Correspondence with the Ot∣toman Port; where their Ambassadors had been treated with Friendship, and their Merchants with Security, and their Trade flourished on all sides with Profit and Ad∣vantage. One Achmet Aga being proposed for this Embassy, he was severally treated and feasted by the three Ambassadors, who by the Discourses they had entertained with him, observed him to be a Person discreet, and better practised in Affairs of Countries different to their own, than commonly Turks are, who think it an Indignity to them,  to look into the States of Christian Princes, which so lately the Ottoman Empire over∣looked, as unworthy their Consideration: To Transport this Ambassador a French-ship was appointed, and his Equipage prepar'd;The Em∣bassy put off. but by the Conduct of Sir William Trumbal, English Ambassador then at Constantinople, and the confused Affairs of the Turks, this Embassy did not succeed: And indeed the Turky Company could not expect to Reap any thing from thence, but trouble and ex∣pence, and perhaps displeasure at the Port, in case his Entertainment had not equalled, that which he had received at Paris. Howsoever, the Turks were better resol∣ved in the Point of that Embassy, designed to the Emperor. And to that end, they chose Hamedi Effendi, one who had been bred up a Clerk,Ambassa∣dors de∣signed to the Empe∣ror. and afterwards came to be first Accountant in the Treasury; and Mauvro Cordato, a Greek by Nation, a Man of Intrigue and Business, having for many years been employed for Interpreter to the Grand Vizier, ever since the Death of Pa∣naioti. The Turks being ashamed, as a thing below the Dignity of their Empire to Sue for Peace, thought it might prove a certain consequence in Answer to a civil Letter, written by the Grand Seignior to the Em∣peror, giving notice of his Exaltation to the Ottoman Throne (much after the same Te∣nour with that which was written to the o∣ther Powers) with this Addition and Altera∣tion:  That whereas the ancient Amity and Friendship had been broken during the Reign of his Predecessor, he, as to his own Person, had not been consenting nor instru∣mental thereunto; and that God having pu∣nished the Authors of this War, he resolved to take different Measures; and considering the Emperour as his Neighbour, he was de∣sirous to enter into a League of Friend∣ship with him, and to establish a firm and lasting Peace, in case the Emperor should be inclining thereunto. These Ambassadors were appointed to begin their Journey to∣wards the end of June, towards whose ex∣pences the Grand Seignior intended to allow Six thousand Dollars; which was esteemed a sufficient Provision for them, until they came to the Confines, whence according to the ancient Canon, they are to be conducted by the Emperor's Guards, and defray'd at his Expence: Their Retinue consisted of 60 per∣sons, half of which was habited in the Turkish, and half after the Grecian Fashion. As yet they had received no Passports for them; but in
assurance, that they would be granted, the Ambassadors were posted away to Belgrade, there to remain in expectation of them. The New Grand Seignior during all these Combustions and Negotiations minded lit∣tle, or nothing of Business; nor indeed was he capable of any; for when any thing was propounded to him,The Hum∣our of Sul∣tan Soly∣man. He answered, Yes or No, or with some very short Reply, after the manner of Laconick brevity, and then presently turned away to read the Alchoran. He was at first reputed after the manner of his Father, to be impotent as to Women; but afterwards taking five or six into his Em∣braces, he gave the World cause to con∣ceive another Opinion of him. He sat as aukwardly on Horse-back as his Father, that Exercise being uneasie to him; his chief Divertisements were his Books, (which we may believe he ill understood) and some∣times taking the Air on the Water, and in Chiosks, or Garden Houses on the side of the Bosphorus, he passed his pleasant time. Yeghen still continued to Ravage the Country between Sophia and Belgrade, as his Comrade Yedic that Arch-robber did in Ana∣tolia: And the Government being too weak to suppress two such Thieves or Highway-Men, how much less was it able to contend with the German Troops? They were forced to dissemble, and give way to the present Extremities;Yeghen made Se∣raskier. by making Yeghen Seraskier in Hungary, whilst Hassan Pasha was forced to give way, and fly privately out of the reach of his Competitor. The News hereof flew with great hast to the Thieves in Ana∣tolia, who being encouraged with the Suc∣cess of Yeghen,His Com∣plices on couraged. under whose Government they all fancied to be made Pashas or Gran∣dees, came over in great numbers to joyn with him: Amongst which one Temac Bo∣luckbashee, a leading Man, with Four hun∣dred of his Robbers passed boldly over from Asia to Constantinople; and Yedic their General was not only pardoned, but made a Pasha. To this hard Plight and Extremity was the Ottoman Empire reduced; when the Turks placing their greatest hopes in the Tartars,An Aga sent to Transilva∣nia. dispatched away an Aga to Apafi Prince of Transilvania, with a Patent to con∣firm him in his Principality; and with Or∣ders to demand of him in consideration there∣of a round Sum of ready Money, where∣with to Succour, and pay the Garrisons on the Boristhenes; and to provide for the Main∣tenance of Caminiec, which was in want of Ammunition, and all things necessary. And to persuade Apafi hereunto, he told Stories very improper and unfit to compass his ends; for he rehersed all the Tumults of the Zorbas at Constantinople, and that the Grand Seignior was forced to create Yeghen, who was their Chief and Leader, to be Se∣raskier in Hungary. That in Constantinople there was want of every thing, even to a Famine, caused by the Seditions and Muti∣nies of the Soldiers; and that for the appea∣sing these Tumults, and for the Donative unto the Soldiers, which is usually given by the Sultans at their Inauguration, the Exchequer had been drained of Twenty Millions of Dollars; wherefore he urged the States of Transilvania to grant him his Demands; in failure of which he threatned them with the Incursions of the Tartars, who had already passed the River Prut, and were enter'd into the Neighbouring Provinces, where they had left sad Marks of their cruel and miserable Devastations: And that Sultan Galga, and Noradin with a mighty Army were marching to oppose the Empe∣rors designs upon Belgrade. General Carafa having notice of these Practices upon Transilvania, went with all hast thither; and in a short time not only defeated this Aga in his Negotiations, but also so well disposed Apafi, and the States of Transilvania with entire Devotion to the Emperor, that in despight of the Message brought by the Aga; they absolutely re∣nounced all Obedience, and Duty to the Ot∣toman Port: The which Renuntiation fol∣lows in this manner. We Michael Teleky de Szek General, George and Alexius de Bethlem, Laodislaus Szekel of Boroszeno, Valentine Frank one of the Judges, Christian Zato Consul of the City of Hermanstadt, Counsellors to the Illu∣strious Prince of Transilvania: As also Ni∣cholas of Bethlem, Stephen Appor, Peter Alvinzy, and John Starosy Principal and publick Notaries, Michael Filstrick Judge of the City of Braslavia, Plenipotentiaries depu∣ted by the Prince aforesaid, and by the States of the Kingdom of Transilvania; do hereby declare and make known unto all the World, desiring that these Presents may remain upon Record, for a lasting Testimony unto all Ages. With great Reason may this present Age remain astonished, and envious Eyes become dazled with the Splendor of the Divine Cle∣mency; which not suffering its beloved Chri∣stendom to Groan longer under the Yoak of Barbarous Pride, nor remain in Bonds to Ty∣rannical Servitude, nor longer to be overwhel∣med, and drowned after so many Wars in a Sea of Innocent Blood; hath at length out of his great Compassion, been pleased to exert the strong Power of his Omnipotent Arm, to Re∣scue so many Kingdoms and Provinces, from an unsupportable Slavery under the Turks, who transported with senseless Fury had ren∣dered themselves formidable to the World, ruinous to their Neighbours, and Despisers of
all People, besides their own. But behold! How the God of Hosts, being justly displeas∣sed with these vain Boastings, hath thrown his Thunder-bolts amongst them, and dispersed them, making the most August Emperor Leo∣pold the First an Instrument of his Vengeance, and having showred Flouds of Blessings on his Glorious and Triumphant Arms, hath encom∣passed his Royal Head with Wreaths of Victo∣rious Laurel; whilst the Ottoman Throne is dressed up with Mournful Cipress. Such were the astonishing operations of the Divine Power, made manifest to all the World. For when the barbarous Tyranny was in its full Career, and was in the Trail of a hot Scent after Christian Blood; then was God pleased to stop them in their Course; and re∣duce their unstable and depressed Fortune to the doubtful Terms of Hope and Fear. It is now near an Age, that unhappy Tran∣silvania hath been depressed by the unsupporta∣ble Ottoman Yoak, and bewailed the loss of her lawful King and Lord: And after having been Turmoiled, tossed with Storms of War, with Fire and Sword, and Civil Dissentions, all things have been so confused and defaced, that scarce any thing hath remained on the Registers of it's ancient Glory; only since the Dominion of the Turk gained by the intestine differences of it's own Princes, some Memori∣als are written, and reserved to represent to the World a History of a most direful Tragedy. But now the maligne Influence of the Stars being either abated, or entirely exhausted; and the Ambitious Pride, and Designs of private Men defeated, Transilvania embra∣ces the Paternal, and Powerful Protection of the most August Emperor of the Romans, Leo∣pold the First, and Hereditary King of Hun∣gary, and of all his Successors, and particu∣larly of the most Serene Prince Joseph King of Hungary, (whose Life may God long con∣tinue) and of his Heirs after him, according as it hath been concluded and agreed in the year 1687, at the last Diet at Possonium with full Consent, Approbation and Concur∣rence of all the States of Hungary, who have for a long time poured out their Prayers and Tears, and Sighs before God, that at length through the Divine Mercy, they might obtain the Enjoyment of this long wished Felicity. Be it therefore Enacted, Established, and made known to this present, and to future Ages; That to the Glory of the Omnipotent God, and for the more quiet, and prosperous State of this Principality, both in this, and in Ages to come; We the said Plenipotentia∣ries deputed by the Illustrious Prince, and States of this Kingdom, do with our free Will and Christian Zeal, Renounce all Protection from the Turk; declaring that for the future, We will send him no Presents, nor pay him Tribute; Nor will we maintain any Correspon∣dence with the Ottoman Port, their Adhe∣rents or Dependants, whether Turks or Chri∣stians; or with any others, who are Enemies to the Majesty of the Roman Emperor our gra∣cious Lord, or to his lawful Successours, and Hereditary Kings of Hungary; upon Penal∣ty of High Treason, to be punished according to the Laws of this Country, after due Convi∣ction of the Crime. And in lieu of that Pow∣er which we have now renounced, We do with all Sincerity, and Purity of Heart Enter, and List our selves under the Protection of the most August Emperor; and engage not on∣ly our selves, but our Posterity of this King∣dom of Transilvania. And for an Evidence of this our Submission and Agreement, by ver∣tue of the power we have received from his Highness the Prince, and the States of the Country, We do admit, and receive the Im∣perial Forces, into the Fortress of Kôvar, Huss, Georgim and Braslavia, besides other places already garrisoned by German Soldiers. Moreover we declare, That we shall be ready at all times, to take up Arms against the Com∣mon Enemy of Christendom, and against all others, as we shall be commanded by our most gracious Lord; whom with all Humility, We Pray and Beseech, that he would be gracious∣ly pleased to confirm our Priviledges, and the free Exercise of our Religion, as we have hi∣ther to enjoyed: And also, that he would Pro∣tect, and Defend our Posterity, and Succes∣sors in the said Liberty and Priviledges: And in the mean time that the Teaty and Convention made with the Duke of Loraine may remain in full Force and Vertue; We have in Testimony thereof and for greater E∣vidence and Manifestation to all the World, ratified and confirmed this our Abjuration, and Renuntiation of the Ottoman Protection under the Seal of the three Nations of the Kingdom of Transilvania. Given at Hermanstadt the 9th of May, 1688. These happy Successes made way for the Surrender of Alba Regalis, which all this time held out, supplying themselves some∣times with Provisions by Sallies and Excur∣sions, which they often made even to the Walls of Buda. Wherefore it being wisely considered, that this Garrison might still defend it self for a long time,Alba Re∣galis straight∣ned. unless the Blocade were more streightly watched; and such Forces disposed on all sides, as might suffer none either to go in, or come out of the City; Prince Herman of Baden President of the Counsel of War, projected a formal Blocade,  and with some Parties of Germans and Hungarians, within the Ju∣risdiction of his own Government, toge∣ther with some Militia of General Count Bathyani, Commanded by himself; and the former Conducted by Colonel Baron Arey∣zagaMay.
Governour of Leopolstadt, and these were enjoyned to make an actual Attack upon the place, in case they under∣stood, that a Blocade was not likely to suc∣ceed. About the beginning of May these Forces appeared in view of Alba Regalis; and a strict Blocade was formed on all sides of the Town. Howsoever, the Defendants seem∣ed not to lose Courage, but on the con∣trary, made a stout Sally both with Horse and Foot; the Issue of which was of no greater Importance, than only the taking off the Heads of some unfortunate Soldiers on one side and the other. And now at length to make their last effort, the Turks made another Sally on the Germans, but soon retired again without any Action;The Turks make a Sally. which gave opportunity to the Van-guard, to advance within Cannon-shot of the Town; with which the Defendants became so terrified, that the three Chief Comman∣ders sent forth a Turk well clothed and mounted, to make some motion for a Treaty: The Turk approaching near the Vanguard, desired to speak with some of the Chief Captains, letting them know, that he had Offers to make of a Surrender; which whilst he was uttering, several other Turks Sallied out with a kind of cheerful Air and Briskness,They Capi∣tulate. one of which advancing be∣fore, demanded of the Christian Soldiers, what it was they required? To which An∣swer being made: The Town. Reply was made; But we must know first on what Conditions; may we not, said they, ex∣pect to receive the same Articles, that were given to Agria? And may not we obtain the Favour to have our Treaty Signed at Vienna, by the great Emperor of the Ro∣mans: To which Answer was made, That thô they had no Power, nor Authority to give them any assurance of the latter, yet they would endeavour to give them satis∣faction in that point, as well, as in o∣thers. Hereupon Articles were drawn into se∣veral Heads and sent into the City, the which, next day being consider'd in the Divan, and by common consent agreed unto, were Signed by the three Pashas, and Chief Commanders of the Garrison; the Sum of all which being this: That the same Conditions should be given in all Points,The Arti∣cles are a∣greed, and Messengers sent to Vi∣enna. as to Agria. And as to the Con∣firmation of these Articles by the Emperor, that the Turks might be satisfied therein, an Express was dispatched to Prince Herman of Baden, that he might send Advice to the Emperor of this Success, and withall to intimate the Desires of the Turks to have their Articles confirmed by the Imperial Signature. The which being granted, Ali Aga, and Ali Beg were commissioned by the Garrison to carry the Articles to Vienna; and being come near to the City, an Offi∣cer was sent to meet them with a Coach, by whom with a Guard they were condu∣cted to the chief Inn of the City, where they were Lodged, and provided with all things necessary for their Entertainment. The Emperor not being in the City, but at his Country-House at Luxemburg, the Turks lost the curiosity of their Desires; and Honour of Kissing the Hem of the Emperor's Garment: Howsoever, after ha∣ving been courteously treated, they were with much expedition dispatched away, that the Surrender of the Town might not be delaied; for in War are many Hazards: And perhaps the Commanders of the Town might have projected this pretence for a delay, not knowing what might happen in the interim by Succours from Belgrade; which were promised, and daily expected to relieve them. In consideration of which the Marquis Herman of Baden, President of the Council of War, procured the Im∣perial Signature to their Capitulations with all hast imaginable, and having made a Present to each of them of a Watch, they were Conducted back to Alba Regalis by Count Zicchy,  who had all that Winter been very Active to Watch that Garrison, and force them to a Surrender. Thus these two Commissioners being returned to Alba Regalis, with the Articles of Surrender signed and confirmed, they enter'd into the Divan with the Pashas, and other Com∣manders, and after some Debate and Con∣sultation, they resolved on an immediate Surrender, and without other pause or de∣lay, they began to laid their Goods and Moveables on Carts and Waggons: And on the next day being the 19th of May,May. they quitted the City, and went out by the Gates, to the number in all of about Eight thousand Souls, amongst which there were not above Three hundred Soldiers. The Articles on which the Town was Surren∣der'd were these. First, That the Castle, and City with all the Ammunition, Cannon and Arms, with the Bells, Clocks, and all things of publick use, shall without Fraud, or Design be delivered up; and what Mines that are, either in the Castle or Town, shall be discovered, and made known. Secondly, That permission shall be given without let or hindrance, or molestation what∣soever to the Garrison and Inhabitants freely to leave the City with their Arms, Horses, Beasts, Goods and Moveables. Thirdly, That the Sons of Christian Wo∣men, who are Slaves, and do not pass the Age
of Eighteen, shall remain in the Power, and under the Government of their Fathers, who were Turks. But those who are of riper Years, and past that Age, shall be left to their own free Will, to chuse which side, or party they will take. And as to those who were Born Chri∣stians, and are under Age, as well Males, as Fe∣males shall be delivered faithfully into the Hands of the Christians; and in case amongst the Turks, any Person shall be desirous to turn Christian, no Person shall dare to hinder, or pervert him. Fourthly, That Three hundred Waggons shall be provided for carrying their Goods and Moveables, as far as Gian Curtaran upon the Danube; where Seventy Boats or more (in case Seventy be not sufficient) shall be furnish∣ed for Transport of the People and their Goods to such Places, as they shall desire; and in the mean while whilst the Waggons are pro∣viding, and the Garrison is issuing forth, the principal Turks of the City shall remain for Hostages. Fifthly, That some German and Hunga∣rian Officers shall go with the Convoy, which Conducts the People to the Danube, where being Embarked, they shall Accompany and Protect them to the next Garrisoned Town of the Turks; and for security of the safe return of such Officers, some principul Turks shall be given for Hostages, to remain at Oseck until all Conditions are executed, and then after∣wards they shall have free liberty to depart. Sixthly, All Christian Captives, as well young as old, shall be set at liberty. Thus Alba Regalis being Surrender'd on the 19th of May, as we have said, Te Deum was Sung in the principal Moschs, and on the 20th the Turks began to take their way towards Gian Curtaran;1688. The Gar∣rison of Aloa Re∣galis Marches out. and a sufficient Garrison of Imperialists entered the City, to the number of Five hundred Germans, and about One thousand Hussars Horse and Foot, under the Command of Colonel Areizaga, there to remain until farther Or∣ders from the Emperor. Some few days afterwards Count Stephen Zicchy, Lieuten∣ant General of Giavarin, who by Order of the Counsel of War had with a Guard of Five hundred Hussars, Three hundred Mus∣quetiers of the Regiment of Wech, and Three hundred Horse of the Circle of Sua∣bia, convoyed the Turks to the place ap∣pointed, returned back to Alba Regalis, where he reported, the great Sense the Turks had of the faithful observance, which was given to the Articles; concerning which they had made many Expressions of Satis∣faction; saying that it was no wonder, That the Christians gather so many Lau∣rels of Victory, since they knew so well with Sincerity, and Religion to observe, and comply with the Faith they had gi∣ven: The which may more evidently ap∣pear by the Letter here following, Written to the Marquis of Baden. MOst Happy, most Honourable and Gen∣tle Prince, Vizier of the Emperor of the Romans, Friend, and dear Brother, after these our sincere Salutations shall be come to your Hands, Be it made known unto you, That in that happy Hour, when the Imperial Decree of your most Gracious, and Glorious Emperor, and our Lord, and also your obli∣ging Letter filled with courteous Expressions, and Demonstrations of Civility used towards our Messenger Ali Aga, and Ali Bei came to Hand, we were greatly comforted, to have found favour, by means of your intercession, in the Eyes of your Gracious Emperor, whom the High God reward, and recompense with his Divine Grace. For that in pursuance of the Sacred Command Signed by your Emperor, the Honourable General Bathyani, and his other Officers have carefully protected us, not only when we quitted the Town, but during all our March towards the Danube; so that by the regular Discipline and watchful Eye of the Germans, and Hungarians towards us, we are safely arrived at Gian Curtaran. And so much we have thought fit to acknowledge, and expose at the Feet of your Highness; that it may be made manifest to the World, with how much Sincerity and Faith, this Treaty hath been Executed. As to other Matters, we find the Boats and Vessels all in a readiness, so that we Design to Embark and depart ear∣ly to Morrow Morning; for all which good and punctual performance, we beseech God to succeed, and prosper you. Dated the 23d of the Moon of Re∣geb 1099. That is, the 22d of May 1688. Subscribed by the Servants of God. Achmet Vizier Commander in Chief, Aga of the Janisaries, Zagargee Pasha. Besides this Letter the same Persons wrote another to Count Bathyani of the like Tenure; acknowledging the due Ob∣servance and Execution of the Treaty. When the People, and Garrison of this City, to the number of about Eight thou∣sand Souls, passed down the River by Towns belonging to the Turks, great was the Confusion and Consternation amongst them, but more was the shame to the prin∣cipal Officers, who had either by their Negligence or Cowardise, or ill Coduct, not relieved so important a City, but suffered it to be reduced to the utmost Extremities of Famine, without hopes of Succour: And at the same time, that the Fortresses of Sigeth and Canisia, were in no better Condition, being reduced almost to the
like Extremity with Alba Regalis, which being well known to the Imperial Counsel of War, Orders were given to streighten those places by a more close, and strict Blocade. About this time to hasten the Preparati∣ons, and to draw out the Measures, and Scheme of War for the ensuing Campaign; the Duke of Loraine arrived at Vienna,Counsels of War at Vienna. where several Conferences and Counsels were held, by the great Captains and Ge∣nerals, than which, never did any Age pro∣duce more Brave, Valiant and Wise of Conduct, than appeared in this present year. There are many things concur to form and complete a General of Renown; towards which nothing doth more contribute, than Fortune and Success in War; of which the Imperialists had for some years had a happy Run, and plaid long with a lucky Hand. The Turks on the contrary had lost the most part of their bravest Officers, and Soldiers; and those which had escaped out of the Bat∣tles, became a Sacrifice to the Rage, and Fury of Mutinous and Dissolute Soldiers, who having thrown off the Bridle of all Discipline, turned their Swords from their Enemies upon their own Commanders and Generals; and this was not the least Mis∣fortune of the Turks, that the most captived People, and such as formerly served with the most blind Obedience, had forgot to obey, or revere their Sultans. But now if we should compare these obscure Com∣manders of the Turks, Men started from nothing, unexperienced in War, Thieves and Robbers,The Com∣manders on either side com∣pared. such as Yeghen, and his Master Yedic, who for some Years had lived on Spoils in the lesser Asia, with the Redoub∣ted, and Valiant Generals of the Imperial Armies, we may without the help of ancient Prophesies, Prognosticate the continued Suc∣cesses of the Imperial Arms: The Names of which Generals are these, worthy to be Recorded for ever in History. The Duke of Loraine. The Elector of Bavaria. Prince Lewis of Baden. The Chri∣stian Ge∣nerals and Officers.Count Caraffa. Count de Staremberg, Marshal of the Field to the Emperor. The Prince of Salm, a Field Marshal, to whom the Education of the young King of Hungary was committed. Count de Rebata, Commissary General of the Emperor's Armies. Count Dunewald, General of the Empe∣ror's Horse. Count Palfi, another General of Horse. Count de Sereni, General of the Bava∣rian Horse. Prince de Croy, General of the Artillery Gondola, Chief Lieutenant General of Horse, and a very ancient Officer. Count Taff, another Lieutenant General of Horse. Count Scheffenburg, a Lieutenant Ge∣neral of Foot. The Prince of Neubourg, Great Master of the Teutonick Order. The Prince of Savoy. Veterani, a brave General, full of Cour∣age. Piccolimini the like. The Prince of Lommercey, Rabutin, Ne∣grelli and Esterhasi, Apremont and Wal∣lis, all Major Generals, were Persons of great Reputation and Bravery, Fit, and Proper to Lead, Conduct, and Command an Army. To give all these Generals a Character agreeable to their Worth and Merit, would be too great a Talk, and savour, something of Flattery, which is disagreeable to the Sincerity of an Historian. Howsoever, we may adventure to draw some few Lines, in describing the Complexion of those Heros, to whose Valour and Conduct Christen∣dom is so much obliged for it's Defence and Safety. The Duke of Loraine was a Prince Na∣turally Valiant,Character of the Duke of Loraine. and unconcerned in Dan∣gers, exposing himself without Ostentati∣on or Vanity, into Perils, where he judged, that his forwardness was requisite to ani∣mate his Soldiers, and to give them an Ex∣ample to imitate his Valour. And as his Temperament was uncapable of Fear, so amidst the most hazardous Condition he was always setled and composed, and ca∣pable to give and receive Counsel; and wil∣lingly hearkned to the Advices of any, that pretended to have an insight into Mat∣ters: Howsoever, thô he was not esteemed to have a large Prospect into Matters, or to draw a Scheme for a whole Campaign; yet in the Management of a Battle, or taking all the Advantages, no General in the World was ever more capable. Howsoever it was objected against him, That he was over loose in his Marches, and acted with little Order therein; that he was not care∣ful to strengthen his Convoys, nor to se∣cure his Forages, by which, and a thousand other Oversights of this nature, we read in History, that whole Armies have been con∣founded, and mouldred to nothing: There is no Man, without his Faults and Defects; of, as we say, without his blind side: Yet the World must avouch, that he was a great Captain, and a Person of most excellent Qualifications; for it is not little to his Honour that he was not Ambitious, or transported with vain Glory; but firm and
zealous for the Interest of the Emperor, tho he little regarded his own, by endea∣vouring to form and project strong Leagues against France. Character of the the Elector of Bavaria.The Elector of Bavaria was another Ge∣neral of great Renown; than whom no per∣son in the World was endued with more na∣tural Valour; indefatigable in War, and would never be wearied or faint, thô he should be constrained to fight every day. Skirmishes were his divertisements; and thô he was a General, yet he could condes∣cend to the degree of an inferior Officer, in giving Orders, where they were neces∣sary. At this time he was Young, and con∣sequently had not as yet seen many Cam∣paigns; but no Prince was ever more capa∣ble, and of greater hopes, which some Years afterwards were brought to all Per∣fection. He loved Battels; and to put the Troops of his Enemies to Flight, and to make himself Master of the Field, and to gain Victories, were his great pleasures; but as to the Plunder of the Field, and the great Booties obtained therein, he left all to his Officers and Soldiers, never demand∣ing any share, or account of them. How∣soever he was esteemed also to have his De∣fects; for it is said, That he looked not with due attention to the care of his Troops; and that as he was very diligent and vigi∣lant in the time of action; yet afterwards he indulged himself too much to his Plea∣sures in the times of Vacation and Ease from his Labours; and it may be said of him as was of a Roman General, That he was Patiens Laboris, indefessus in bello, sed ubi vacuerit, nimiae voluptatis. Prince Lewis of Baden was a true Man of War,Character of Prince Lewis of Baden. cut out for a Soldier from his In∣fancy; in which Trade being Educated, he soon arrived to a singular Perfection, being naturally addicted to Arms. He was full of Courage, Heat, and Bravery; Active, Vigilant, and a Man of Order in disposing of his Troops; always on Horse-back, and capable of doing great Actions; as we shall see verified Two or Three Years after∣wards: Howsoever he was not without some allays, by a too obstinate adherence to his own Opinion, and Councils; which if at any time he was forced to retract or change, so as to follow the Advices and Counsels of others, yet he would do it with an ill Grace and Will, and not without some mixture of his own contrivance. He was more fit for an Army than a Court; giving his Tongue too much liberty to Speak and Discourse freely of the Faults and Defects of the chief Ministers of State; which be∣got him some Enemies, but his Greatness of Mind, and Success in War, carried him above all. Count Caraffa was advanced by the fa∣vour of Count Montecuculi his Uncle;Count Ca∣raffa. to which his own Merits contributed very much; for being a Soldier of Fortune, he resolved to rise by that way; and being endued with a natural Courage, he signali∣zed himself on several occasions. His En∣terprizes were always performed with great moderation, and Phlegm, watching his op∣portunities of advantage upon the Enemy, and seldom inclined to hazard any thing; his Counsels were full of prudent Caution, which made his Performances suspected by the Enemy, fearing some Turn which they did not foresee. He was also a Courtier as well as a Soldier, and knew how to comport himself towards the chief Mini∣sters of State in the Court; as he did also to the Generals, and Officers, and Soldiers in the Camp. Count Staremberg,Count Starem∣berg. one of the Emperor's Field-Marshals, a Person Renowned through the World for the defence of Vienna, was a person of admirable Courage and much Fire in his Temper, and endued with all Qualities fit for a Soldier, thô not so proper for a General, being naturally violent and trans∣ported with Passion. He is, as we find him, more celebrated amongst Foreigners and Strangers for defending Vienna, than amongst the Germans, who served in the Garrison with him, alledging that he exposed his Soldiers too frequently to unnecessary Sal∣lies, and was too prodigal of spilling their Blood. The Prince of Salm was another Field-Marshal,The Prince of Salm. to whom the Education of the Young King of Hungary was committed. It is said, That he hath served long, and gained great Experience in the War: But his Valour, Wisdom, and Nobility, have en∣dued him with such Vertues, as serve not only to render him esteemed and honoured for himself, but capable also to inspire Learning, and Royal Thoughts into the Mind of that Young King. Count Rabata, another Field-Marshal, and Commissary-General of the Imperial Army,Count Rabata. was esteemed more capable of the latter, than of the first Office. For as to the providing for the subsistence of an Army, no man was ever reputed more intelligent and industrious, being endued with an admirable Faculty to draw out a Scheme for Winter-Quarters; and the man∣ner how to regulate Troops with such Dis∣cipline, as might tend to the Conservation of the Provisions of a Country, which Sol∣diers are apt to consume unnecessarily; es∣pecially the German Armies, which love Plenty and Excess; and do commonly, (if not prevented by good Management) ruin those Countries in Two Months, which
might otherwise conveniently maintain an Army for the whole Year. Dunewald.Count Dunewald, General of the Impe∣rial Cavalry, was esteemed very capable of that Charge; and with all the Reason and Justice in the World, may be numbred amongst the best of those Officers, who are esteemed, to be Couragious, Wise, and Experienced in War. Count Palfi.Count Palfi, General of the Hungarian Horse, was a man of great Understanding; but because he hath not served in any other Wars, than those of Hungary, he is not much esteemed for a Soldier; howsoever being descended from one of the most An∣cient and Noble Families in Hungary, the Court of Vienna judged it policy, to give in his Person an Example and Proof of the Emperor's Favour and good Will towards the Hungarian Nobility: By reason of which he made a speedier advance into Prefer∣ments in the War, than could reasonably be expected from his Services, and Actions. Count Serien.Count de Serien, General of the Bava∣rian Troops, besides his other Qualities, hath but too much of Wit and good Ma∣nagement, by which he seldom fails of ar∣riving at the end of his designs, having by his Conduct and good Fortune, got into the Command of the Bavarian Troops: And so insinuated himself into the Court of Vienna, that they seem to say, that they are obliged to him, for the strict Alliance which the Ele∣ctor hath made with the House of Austria. In short, he was esteemed for a Person of ad∣mirable dexterity in avoiding invidious mat∣ters, without being either suspected or per∣ceived. P. of Croy.The Prince of Croy, General of the Artil∣lery, was a person of undoubted Valour. Gondola.Gondola, first Lieutenant-General of the Horse, was a very Ancient Officer; much beloved by his own Soldiers; in short he is a man without Vice, Vivacity of Spirit, or Ambition, being of a Conversation easy, and inoffensive to all the World. Count Taff.Count Taff, a Lieutenant-General of the Horse, was a very Gallant man, having in all occasions of danger acquitted himself with great Courage; and yet he is not so much to be commended for his Military performances, as for the Character he hath acquired of a just, civil, and an honest Gentleman. He was of great Understand∣ing, pleasant Conversation, good Literature, and well studied, accomplished in all his Exercises, doing every thing with a good Grace. In fine, he would be supereminent in every thing, did he not prefer those Qualities which rendered him useful before those which made him acceptable. I had once the honour to see him at Vienna, and have some acquaintance with him in the Year 1666. Count Souches, chief Lieutenant-General of the Infantry,Souches. was greatly advanced by those Employments which his Father had bequeathed to him. Count Schaffenberg,Schaffen∣berg. Lieutenant-General of the Foot, was a person of great Courage, but something tenacious. The Prince of Neuburg,Neuburg. Great Master of the Teutonick Order, was a very good Man, but heavy and unactive; bold in danger, but without much Application to business. The Prince of Savoy,P. of Savoy. a Gentleman of great Courage, of more solid Judgment, than quickness of Fancy. He was a Man of good Learning, and in his studies had ap∣plied his mind to that part of the Mathe∣maticks, which treats of Fortifications; by which, and by practice in War, there was great hope, that with time, he would arrive at those eminent degrees of Honour and Preferment, of which the greatness of his Birth, and his own Virtues made him capable. Veterani was as Brave and Valiant as any,Veterani. having signalized himself in the last War by an extraordinary Action, worthy for ever to be remembred. He was an Ita∣lian by Birth, but so plain and unaffected in his Speech and Behaviour, that he seemed to have contracted nothing of the Air of that Nation, but the Name only. Heusler was a Soldier of Fortune,Heusler. as stout and brave as Hercules himself; no man more Valiant, and none more Active and Vigi∣lant, and by his Merits only arrived to the highest Commands in the Army; his Com∣portment, Motions, and way of Speak∣ing savoured of a man of Quality. Piccolomini,Piccolo∣mini. was not only endued with Courage, which is the first Principle of a Soldier; but was a Master in the Trade of War: Tho' he hath been maliciously tradu∣ced, as wanting both; but his own Actions, Conduct, and Success in many Battels, have evinced the contrary. To these we might add the Prince of Lommercy, Rabbatin, Nigrelli, Esterhasi, Apremont, and Wallis, all Major-Generals of Renown, and Famous Reputation, be∣sides many other Field-Commanders, Cap∣tains and subaltern Officers; so that, as we have said, no Age could ever boast of more brave and undaunted Spirits. On the con∣trary, the Turks had in several Battels, un∣fortunate to themselves, lost the best of their brave Soldiers, Pashas, and Timariots, and what remained were cut off by the Chiurbas, and the rebellious Soldiers, (as fore-related;) so that now there scarce survived one person fit, and of sufficient Experience to conduct an Army, as will appear in the sequel of this present Year.
But to return now to the Councils of War held at Vienna for hastening the Cam∣paigne,Result of the Coun∣sels of War at Vienna. and forwarding the Troops, and drawing a Scheme for managing the War of this Year; many and various were the Opinions. At length strict Orders were gi∣ven to Mareschal Caprara, immediately to go to Oseck; and there consult with Count Apremont, Governor of that place, on such methods, as might best contribute to the Service of his Imperial Majesty, both as to the Enlargement of the Conquests, and Sub∣sistence of the Soldiery: In order unto which, great Numbers of Boats were la∣den with all sorts of Provision and Ammu∣nition, and dispeeded down the Rivers of Danube, Vagus, Tibiscus, and Drave, for undertaking some considerable Enterprize. Orders were also dispatched from the Council of War to General Caraffa in Tran∣silvania; That having committed the com∣mand of the Upper-Hungaria to Nigrelli, and of Transilvania to General Veterani; and having also satisfied the Quarters of his own Militia, he should forthwith march along the Banks of the Danube, but with such Caution and Vigilance, as might se∣cure him and his Forces from the Surprizals of Tekely; who since the surrender of Agria and Mongatz, had made frequent incursions from Temeswar, as far as Lippa, Julia, and sometimes from Jeno to Waradin. It being judged almost impossible to con∣serve Peter Waradin, by reason of the near∣ness thereunto of Illock, where the Ene∣my maintained a numerous Garrison, it was resolved to draw forth the Troops and Provisions from thence. Howsoever Ca∣prara being desirous first to take a view of Illock, he conveyed himself privately be∣fore the place with some Horse of the Re∣giment of Palfi, and about Two hundred Dragoons on Foot,  and seized on a Mosch before the Gate; but being discovered by the Turks, they Fired such a Volly of Shot up∣on him, that several of his Dragoons were killed, and he received Two Musquet-shots through the Folds of his loose Coat, with which he retired without other hurt or loss. But of more concernment it was to Ge∣neral Caprara to defeat the Camp of the Turks, which they were forming in the open Plains of Salankement; to which end he pre∣pared Boats and Barges, and Bridges to Transport over the Drave the Forces which were on their march from the Upper-Hun∣gary. But the Waters by excessive Rains, had so swollen the Rivers beyond the Banks of their right Channel, that both Horse and Foot were constrained to make a stop at Darda, to which place the General pas∣sed over in a Boat, and there remained un∣til the Waters were fallen; as did also some Bavarian Troops designed to repass the Da∣nube near Buda, on their march to Erdeodi; where having raised a Bridge over the Da∣nube, and Six more over the Moors and Fenns, they joyned with other Forces, and marched in a Body towards Illock. In the mean time,  whilst the Imperial Court was enjoying the pleasures of the Country at Luxemburg, the Duke of Lo∣raine falling sick,The Duke of Loraine Sick. put the Court into some discomposure; for that the Season of the Year being now ripe for Action, the want of the General's presence, would be a necessary retardment to the Proceedings of the Campaigne; howsoever that was hap∣pily supplied by the coming of P. Lewis of Baden, who every day entred into consul∣tation with the D. of Loraine, in what man∣ner they might best carry on the War on the other side of the Save; which being agreed, P. Lewis proceeded to the Camp, where, with Mareschal Caprara, the Imperial Forces were for that time commanded, and with them it was concluded to pass the Save. But now some of the Transilvanians being allured by Succours,The City of Stephano∣polis refuses to receive a German Garrison. and great Assistance promised them by the Tartars, to renounce their sworn Allegiance to the Emperor; the City of Stephanopolis refused to receive a German Garrison, which Design was chief∣ly carried on at the persuasion of the Vala∣chians, who considering that by the Sub∣mission of Transilvania, their Province lay open to the Germans, and through that an easie passage into Tartary; they both joyn∣ned to persuade the People of Stephanopo∣lis, to refuse to take in a Garrison of Ger∣mans. But General Veterani immediately marched to the City with the Regiments of Pace, Taff and Stirum, and by surprize At∣tacked the Suburbs in three places, and being come within Pistol-shot of the Walls, the Dragoons dismounting from their Horses, and raising some Barricadoes to cover them from the Enemies Cannon, they began to throw Bombs into the Castle, by which, and by help of the Regiments of Baden and Schaffemberg, who brought with them two Pieces of great Cannon, and four of small, they batter'd the Town, to the Ter∣rour and Consternation of the Inhabitants;The City Surren∣dered. so that with common consent they cried out for Quarter; which was granted to them by General Caraffa, at Discretion; and the City yielded, as also the Castle, into which five Companies of the Regiment of Baden were admitted. In the mean time General Caraffa with like diligence, Marched with a Body of an Army to Lippa; and having Summoned the City, he was answer'd by their great and Small-shot from the Walls: Upon which the General without any delay
raised two Batteries, by which beating down part of the Wall, he made an At∣tack on the Breach;Lippa at∣tacked. from whence, thô he was repulsed at the first time by the Bra∣very of the Defendants; yet renewing the Assault again with grater Force and Reso∣lution, they enter'd the Town by Storm, with the Death of Five hundred Turks; the rest giving Fire to their Houses and Magazines retired into the Castle, which they maintained a while with good Resolu∣tion. But Caraffa raising two new Batteries, fired incessantly from them, and threw Bombs into it with such good effect, that the Defendants terrified therewith, display∣ed a white Flag,Lippa yielded. and submitted unto Terms of being made Prisoners, to the number of Six thousand Persons, Two thousand of which being Men capable to bear Arms were made Slaves; but the Women and Children were freed, and with a Convoy were sent in safety to Temeswar:  The Sur∣render of Lippa was of great consequence to the Germans, having thereby opened all the Country between the River Maros, and the Tibiscus. This Success was soon followed by the Surrender of Lagos, a Castle four Leagues distant from Lippa, which after a small re∣sistance yielded to Colonel Pace on Articles, according to which about Two hundred Sol∣diers, with One hundred and Eighty Rascians and Valachians marched out,Lagos yielded. together with the Inhabitants of the lower City, and about Six hundred Women and Children. Within was only one Mortar-piece, and eight Pieces of Cannon; but no Victuals or Am∣munition. The like Fortune had succeeded at the great Castle of Caranzebes, had not the Attacks been disappointed by an excessive Rain of four or five days; which forced Colonel Pace to return back to General Carafa, who remained still in expectation of his coming to Lippa. The Indisposition of the Duke of Lo∣raine increasing, and little hopes of his Re∣covery to such a state of Health, as was re∣quisite to Conduct an Army during the present Campaign; the Elector Maximilian Emanuel Duke of Bavaria,  was the only person looked upon fit for the high Com∣mand of General of the Imperial Forces: For he was a Prince thô young in Years,The Elector of Bavaria made Ge∣neral. yet for his time, of that vast experience, and of that Disposition and Courage, na∣turally inclined to War, that he seemed not to come behind any of those renowned Generals, famed for Heroick Actions in past Ages; wherefore being elected by the consent of all the General Officers, for Commander in Chief of the whole Army, the Count Kaunitz was dispatched with the Imperial Letters to the Elector at Monaco, inviting him to accept of this important Charge. But because the Season of the year was far advanced, and that no time was to be lost, Prince Lewis of Baden was dispatched to the Army to joyn with Mar∣shal Caprara, both for Conservation of the new Conquests, and to dispose Matters in order to farther Victories. Nor were the Turks only vexed with the ill Successes of War, but were also afflicted with Earthquakes, Mutinies, Conspiracies, amongst their Soldiers, with Robberies and Disordes over all Asia. On the 30th of June,  about half an hour before Twelve a Clock at Noon, which is the common time of Dinner, hapned a most dreadful Earthquake at Smyrna, which in a few Moments over-threw almost all the Houses in the City, with the Death (as is computed) of Five thousand of the Inhabi∣tants, many of which were drawn out half Dead from the Ruins. This terrible Judg∣ment, by the good Providence of God hapning to be on a Saturday,An Earth∣quake at Smyrna. (which com∣monly the Consul, and Factors of the English Nation make a Day of divertise∣ment without any business) most of them were abroad, either in the Country, or on board some Ships in the Port, from whence they easily heard the lamentable Noise, and Cries of the falling City, not now to be seen, or discerned through the vast and thick Dust which cover'd all the Ruins; those who were in the Ships were sensible of the Shake; for the Seas lifted up the Ships, the Guns leaped in the Carriages, and the Seamen on the Deck were as unsteddy on their Feet, as in a Storm at Sea. Some who were on the Shoar, felt the Earth trem∣bling under them, Stagger'd, and were thrown to the Ground. In the Houses of our Merchants, three only of the English Nation perished, namely, Mr. Samuel Ber∣nardiston, Mr. Henry Stephens and Mr. Richard Pierce, all killed by the falling of a main Beam, as they were sitting at Din∣ner: Several others which remained at Home, are still alive to recount their won∣derful Escape, whilst the Tops, Tiles and Rafters of the Houses fell round about them without any Wound, or touch on their Bodies. But had it so pleased God, that this Earthquake should have hapned on any other Day in the Week besides Satur∣day; it is more than probable, that many more of the English Factory would have perished in the Ruins. Of the Jews Four hundred were killed, and amongst them one of their most famous Rabbis of the East, called Aron Ibben Haim. The Metropolite of Smyrna with many of his Papasses, who went into their Church to Pray, were killed by the fall of the Roof. The like Fate befel
the Patriarch of Alexandria, who with his People was overwhelm'd with the Ruins. Of the French Nation the Consul only was killed; and of the Dutch only one Mer∣chant. About three or four Hours after this dismal Shake, an Irruption of Fire ap∣peared in the Frank Street, (which is a Row of Houses along the Sea side,A Fire breaks out. inha∣bited by the Frank Nations) for so the Turks call all the Western People: This Fire perhaps might at first have been ex∣tinguished, but that smaller Shakes hap∣ning now and then after the greater Earth∣quake, so terrified the People by the fal∣ling of Walls and Tops of Houses, that none daring to come near, suffer'd the Fire to prevail; which consumed much of the Merchants Cloth, melted their Tin, Lead and Money; and burnt up their Papers and Books of Account: So that it cannot be said, whether the Earthquake, or the the Fire did the greatest Damage and De∣vastation: But this is certain, that the Eng∣lish Merchants were very considerable suf∣ferers, some having computed the loss to a Hundred thousand pounds Sterling. It is a great Question from whence this Fire should proceed, some will have it from the Fires in the Kitchins, which were kindled about that time of the Day, for the use and purpose of dressing Meat and other Servi∣ces; but that seems unlikely; for the Kitchin Fires at that time of the Year and of the Day, being not great, might have been more easily extinguished, and smothered by the fall of so much Brick and Rubbish, rather than kindled by the Beams and Rafters; wherefore I believe, that this Incendiation did proceed from an Irrup∣tion of Subterranean Fires, which are the cause of Earthquakes: Thus was it, when the Mount Vesuvius was blown up, and so it was, and is when Mongibello Vomits out it's Flames, making all the Countries tremble round the Island of Sicily; and so it was in the Year 1666, when Ragusi was destroyed with an Earthquake, the Subter∣ranean Fires destroying whatsoever re∣mained under the Ruins: And so it was at Lima in the West-Indies,  where after the Earthquake a Fire broke forth, which con∣sumed that City in the same manner, as afterwards it did at Smyrna. In the Army were great Discontents, as it always happens in times of Misfortune. Yeghen (as we have said) had forced himself upon the Vizier to be made Seraskier or Ge∣neral;Seditions in the Ar∣my. whilst many better Men than he, were laid aside: The Force being so in∣considerable on the Frontiers, it was judged beneath the Dignity of a Vizier, to ap∣pear at the Head of so weak an Army; wherefore remaining that year at Constan∣tinople, where several of the discontented Giurbas had concealed them; a Conspiracy was by them formed against the Grand Vizier and the Government, which had in a few hours taken effect,A Conspi∣racy a∣gainst the Vizier plotted and discovered. had it not been dis∣covered by some of their false Brethren; to prepare which, several Libels were thrown about in the Mosques, condemning the re∣moval of the Grand Seignior, and his Court to Adrianople, to the great Ruin and Detri∣ment of the ancient Seat of the Sultans at Constantinople, and prejudicial to the Em∣pire by such an unnecessary expence: These Libels were seconded by an Arz, or Memorial from the Soldiers to the Vizier himself, importing, that they would not suffer the Sultan to remove from Constanti∣nople; but in case the Vizier would go in Person to the Wars, and first pay them their Arrears, they would accompany him, when the Season was fit for so long a March; but to go and Winter at Adrianople, would discommode them and their Families, and prove of no benefit to the grand Design of War against the Common Enemy the Chri∣stians. This bold Memorial gave Encour∣agement to the Inferiour Janisaries to com∣mit daily Insolences in the Streets; which being connived at by their Officers con∣cerned in the Conspiracy, which was to have been executed on the 23d day of July, gave Fears and Jealousies to the Go∣vernment, that the same Tragedy was acting over again, as had been in the time of the late Giurbas. For the Plot was laid, that the Gebegees, should in a Tumultuous manner go to the Vizier's House to de∣mand their Arrears of Pay; then were the Janisaries upon the Noise hereof to joyn with them, and Assault the Vizier, and take the Government into their own Hands,The Me∣thods of the Plot. as had lately been practised by the Giur∣bas. But on the Vigil before the Executi∣on, the whole Plot was discovered, and those who were to be the principal Actors therein were made known to the Vizier: Who immediately thereupon Summoned such Guards, as he could confide in; and with Five hundred Men went about the City all that Night,  and seized all the Conspirators in their Houses. The next day the Janisar-Aga was displaced, and made Pasha of Van, a City on the Borders of Persia, and one Mahomet Aga (the Segme Bashee, Colonel of a sort of Militia so cal∣led) was advanced to his Office; he was a Man of above Eighty years of Age, very lame by reason of a Wound he had received at the Siege of Candia by a Cannon Bullet, which shot off one of his Buttocks; But yet he was Vigorous, and of a severe Tem∣per, fit to keep such Mutiniers in Discipline and Subjection: The Kiahbei, or Lieute∣nant
General of the Janisaries was also Ca∣shiered, and thô they both pleaded Inno∣cence and Ignorance; yet the want of know∣ledge to discover such a Contrivance hat∣ching amongst their Soldiers, was Crime sufficient to ease them of their Commands. For two Nights following,How pre∣vented. three Parties of armed Men took their Rounds about the City: The first led by the Vizier, The se∣cond by the new Janisar-Aga, and the third by the new Kia-bei; these meeting toge∣ther in the Morning, and conferring Notes, found that they had cut off about Fifty Persons, most of them Janisaries: And se∣veral Nights afterwards some Executions were done, and all acted with such Secre∣cy, and Silence in the dead of the Night, that no Noise or Disturbance followed thereupon; for there was no Man of great Vogue or Repute put to Death, the highest being only in degree a Chiurbagee or Cap∣tain; all which were put into Sacks and thrown into the Sea, according to the pu∣nishment by ancient Constitution to be in∣flicted on Janisaries. Amongst those, who were put to Death was one Hamedi Effendi, who was at first appointed with o∣thers to carry the Grand Seignior's Letter for Peace to the Emperor: Several others being too free in their Tongues against the Vizier,  openly saying that he was decayed in his Parts, and not capable to mannage so great an Employment, uttering other things savouring of a high Contempt of his Person, were put to Death: And amidst these Executions, the Head of Dogangee Shuban, Pasha of Nicopolis, on the Danube, was brought to Town; he had been one of the Giurbas, and Kiah to Siaus Pasha, and once named by him to have been left Chimacam, when the Vizier was at the War: This Report, with the Fame of being designed by the Conspirators to be set up for Vizier, was fatal to him, and procured the Hand-wri∣ting or Sentence for his Death. Yeghen Bei was also suspected to have had a Hand in promoting, and projecting the Conspiracy; but he was too great, as yet to be reached by the waining Power of the Vizier:Yeghen suspected to have been in the Conspiracy. This Sus∣picion had some Foundation from the Coun∣sels, which Yeghen had formerly given, con∣cerning the removal of the Grand Seignior to Adrianople, which as he said could not be done without Hurt, and Damage to the Empire; declaring in like manner by a se∣cond Letter, that in case they should, con∣trary to his Mind and Opinion, remove the Grand Seignior, he would in the Au∣tumn come personally to Adrianople to de∣mand their Reasons for the same. Howsoe∣ver this Vizier was willing to overlook all the extravagant, and insolent Speeches of Yeghen Bei, out of Gratitude, as was said, of sparing his Life; when after the loss of the late Battle, (he then being Janisar-Aga) the Soldiers would have cut him to pieces,The Viziers respect to Yeghen. had not the Authority and Interest of Yeg∣hen with the Militia, spared and secured his Life: In Consideration, and Remembrance of which, he was no sooner created Vizi∣er, than he discharged the Nefran, or Train∣ed Bands of the Country, which the late Ishmael Pasha had raised to suppress Yeghen, then lying with his Forces near to So∣phia. Howsoever, this Conspiracy against the Vizier would scarce have passed over so easily, had not a lucky hit of Two thou∣sand and six hundred Purses (being the E∣state of two rich Kuzlir-Agas cut off,Money come from Grand Cairo. and brought from Grand Cairo in Egypt) been seasonably brought to the Exchequer, which served a little to pacifie the Soldiery, which was now nine Months in Arrear. The Vi∣zier also not thinking himself secure from the Plots and Conspiracies which might still be framed against him, removed Ishmael the late Vizier from Cavalla, a place near Sa∣lonica, where he had been Imprisoned, to the Castle at Rhodes, the famous place for disgraced and banished Officers: He remo∣ved also several from their places of Trust, putting Creatures of his into their Offices; and amongst the rest he made four new Vi∣ziers of the Bench; one of which was Hali Aga, Hasnadar or Treasurer to the Vizier Kupri-oglee, called from Trapezond,Four new Viziers of the Bench made. where he was Pasha; another was Omer Pasha, Tefterdar or Treasurer, who last year in the beginning of the Troubles was Segmen Bashee, or General of that Militia, and had been pulled off from his Horse by the Giur∣bas in the Streets, and turned out of Of∣fice; a third was the Nisangi Bashee, a young Man taken out of the Seraglio, where he was a Page: And a fourth was one of the Vizier's ancient Servants. But notwithstanding the dislike which the Soldiers shewed to the Grand Seignior's removal to Adrianople, the Vizier and his Counsellours resolved to pursue their De∣sign; esteeming it a place more secure and safe for the Government (according to the Maxim of old Kuperlee) where the Milita could be more under their Eye; and Plots not so easily contrived as at Constantinople, where the numbers and Riches of the Peo∣ple were capable at all times to move Di∣sturbances. So in the Month of July,  the Sultan removed to Adrianople, with his de∣posed Brother, his Son, and the other Bro∣ther Sultan Achmet, with the Valide Sul∣tana or Queen Mother. The Court being come to Adrianople, at the first Consult a Peace was proposed, and Ambassadors named to go to Vienna, viz.
Zulficar Aga, and Mavrocordato, who was a Christian, and Interpreter to the Vizier; the Dispatch of these Ambassadors was the more earnestly hastned, by reason of the News then come to the Court, that the Germans were on their March to Invest Bel∣grade. Yeghen Pasha was then at Nissa, where the Differences between him, and Hassan Pasha grew to that Heat, that their Parties falling to Blows, Two hundred were killed in the Fray; which Hassan, being the Wi∣ser, and more temperate Commander, in∣terpreted for a bad Omen of Success in the following Campaign. The Court took lit∣tle Notice of all this Matter; but still con∣tinued to encourage Yeghen with Promises of Additional Forces, and new Supplies, ordering him to oppose all the Designs, and Attempts of the Christians to the ut∣most of his Power; giving him also a Com∣mission to enter into a Treaty of Peace with the Christian General, in case any O∣verture should fairly offer its self. But Yeghen not having with these Commands received the Prophet's Standard,Yeghen in Mutiny. nor the Imperial Seal, which are the Badges and pro∣per Signals of the Office of Grand Vizier, became Angry and Sullen; for tho' he was made General, yet that seemed not suffici∣ent without the Title of Supreme Gover∣nor: And whereas before, he was on his March towards Belgrade, he returned back again to Sophia, declaring that with∣out those powerful Instruments, it was im∣possible for him to Govern the Army, and Rule them with such strict Obedience, as was necessary against so powerful an Ene∣my, and so formidable as the Christians: And as to the Overtures of Peace he was resolved to make none, nor suffer the Am∣bassadors to pass until such time, as he had tried the Fortune of the Ottoman Sword once more in the Field. To this pitch of Insolence was this Yeghen arisen, that he was ready to Sacrifice the whole concern∣ment of the Empire to his own Pride and Vanity: But Express after Express coming from Belgrade with News, that the Germans were Marching towards the Save, with a Resolution to pass that River, so soon, as the Elector of Bavaria should Arrive in the Camp, Yeghen began to grow a little asha∣med; and fearing that all the Misfortunes impending over Belgrade,He returns to Bel∣grade. would be attri∣buted to his ill Government and Sedition, he Marched away from Sophia, and being come to Belgrade, he made publick Decla∣ration, that the Sultan had created him Ge∣neral of all Hungary, upon which the Forces Encamped in the Parts adjacent to the City submitted to his Command; and being now invested with the sole Power, he vented his Spleen against his old Competitor, Has∣san Pasha, with whom formerly (as we have said) he had a Quarrel in Bosnia, and ha∣ving now an opportunity to shew his far∣ther Resentments, he seized on his Tents,Seizes on Hassan Pasha. Horses and Money, and would have strang∣led him, had he not been prevented by the Aga of the Janisaries, and the Son of the Han of Tartary, who was there present with a small Body of Tartars. But the Turks had now something more to do, than to quarrel amongst themselves; for the Christians came pouring upon them on all sides; and how to resist them was the present Incumbence, and grand Con∣cernment; so that laying aside all Intestine differences, Yeghen with Ten thousand Sol∣diers, joyned to the Troops of Tekeli, re∣solved to pass the Save, and Encamp near Semblin on the other side of the River. But that design was laid aside, so soon as News was brought to Belgrade that P. Lewis of Baden was Decamped from Valkovar, and that, together with Caprara, he had taken his march towards Illock; with which,  Yeghen and the Turks fainting in their Courage,The Turks seek for Peace. were inclined rather to Proposals of Peace, than to a continuance of the War; and to try whether any reasonable offers of that nature would be accepted. Two ordinary Peasants were dispatched to Oseck, with Let∣ters to Marquess Herman of Baden, and Marshal Caprara, desiring them to interceed with his Imperial Majesty to put an end to this bloody War, which had already cost the lives of many innocent People, and laid waste and desolate vast and large Countries, and Provinces: But such a Message as this being brought by Peasants,Their Mes∣sengers are suspected. who are im∣proper Instruments to be employed in so eminent an Action, gave just cause to the Generals to take and esteem them for no other than Spyes: Upon which suspicion they were imprisoned, and Advice sent thereof to the Imperial Court; which not judging fit to take notice of any Offers of Peace proposed in such Form, gave new Orders and Instructions to Caprara to pur∣sue with all vigour imaginable the Rules chalked out, and designed for carrying on the Work of this Campaigne. In the mean time the Troops of Bavaria arrived in the Camp under the Command of General Serini, an experienced Captain; and therewith the main Army being rein∣forced,Illock abandoned by the Turks. Caprara took his march towards Il∣lock, of which so soon as the Turks had re∣ceived intelligence, they were put into such consternation, that they abandoned the place; and having packed up what Move∣ables the shortness of time would permit, they set Fire to the City, and retired in a precipitate and disorderly Flight. The Smoke being descryed at a distance, Ca∣prara
detached a Body of Germans, and Hungarians, to advance towards the Town, to observe the face of the Enemy,  and the occasion of that Smoke; and being come near to the Gates, and perceiving that the Soldiers and Inhabitants had deserted the City; the Germans were employed to ex∣tinguish the Fire, and the Hungarians to pursue the flying Enemy; which they per∣formed so effectually, that they seized a great part of the Goods which were then carrying away, and brought them to the Camp. The News hereof so affrighted the Garrison of Peter-Waradin, that with like Terror and Precipitation they abandoned their City, and fled to Belgrade. These Successes gave great encourage∣ment to the whole Army, and to the Im∣perial Court at Vienna, where the Duke of Mantoua about this time arrived, with in∣tention to pass forward to the Camp, and signalize himself and his Followers in a War against the common Enemy; his Equipage was very splendid, and agreeable to the Spirit of so generous a Prince. 1688. July.In like manner the Elector of Bavaria, Maximilian Emanuel the Third arrived at Vienna, being called by the Emperor to com∣mand the Army in Hungary in the place of the Duke of Loraine, who was become so weak by his Indisposition and want of Health, that he judged himself unable to command the Army with such vigour, as was requi∣red in so active a War. The Elector was so intent upon this Expedition,The E. of Bavaria at Vienna, and hastens to the Camp. that the very day he arrived at Vienna with his most Serene Consort, he had departed, and pro∣ceeded to the Camp, had he not been for∣cibly detained by the obliging invitation of the Emperor, and persuaded to stay until the Evening of the following day. In the mean time a design was formed to block up Great Waradin; but the Garri∣son being strong within, the Turks made frequent Excursions with Two hundred Horse, and a Thousand Janisaries at a time, and frequently brought Provisions into the Town, the which was so managed by the Pasha and other Commanders, that the Ca∣stle held out until the Year 1692. How∣soever the Blocade of Sigeth and Canisia was greatly straitned;Sigeth and Kanisia straitned. the first by General Gabriel, Count of Vecchia, and the other by Bathyani, and Zicchy, Lieutenant-Go∣vernor of Giavarin, or Rabb; who appear∣ing before Canisia in order of Battel, the Turks displayed their Colours of defiance, shewing a couragious resolution to defend themselves and their Fortress. Howsoever the Hussars and Heyducks came under com∣mand of the Cannon, and in despite of their shot, set Fire to the Corn and Fruits growing near the City. At which the Turks cryed out with lamentable Voice, saying, Set the fear of God before your Eyes, and do not commit these grievous sins, for which we have been punished by God; for the time was, when we did the like outrages, and disorders, destroying without cause the Christian Churches, for which we have worthily deserved the Di∣vine Vengeance, and are now justly punished for these Offences. In this Fear and Amaze∣ment were the Turks, finding themselves blocked up, and environed round, having Five thousand Women and Children with∣in, without hopes of being ever relieved, or succoured; so that their Courage began to fail, and Thoughts arise amongst them, how they might yield up their City on the most advantageous Terms. In the mean time, P. Lewis of Baden continued his march with all expedition to∣wards Possega;Consulta∣tions to pass the Save. where meeting the Count of Hoffkirchen, they consulted together in what manner they might best offend the Enemy on the other side of the Save; but because the Turks kept the Banks of the River well guarded, the Passage over seem∣ed very difficult, especially wanting Boats to Transport their men: At length, whilst they were considering hereof, News was brought by some of the Heyducks, that about Two Leagues above on the River near Proot, Three Boats lay hid amongst the Flags, and Boughs, of which the Turks had no knowledge; each of which was ca∣pable to Ferry Fifteen or Twenty men at a time over to the other side; upon which in∣telligence, it was resolved, that Hoffkirchen and Serini should in the Night-time pass Eight hundred Heyducks over to the other side; the which were followed by Eight hundred Horse, and Two hundred German Foot, under command of Hoffkirchen; but the Nights were so short, and the Boats so little,Five hun∣dred pass the River. that by Break of day in the Morn∣ing, not above Five hundred of the Hey∣ducks had passed; who finding themselves cut off,  and separated from the rest of their Companions, resolved to attack certain Boats, Barges, and Ferries belonging to the Enemy, which lay on that side of the Water; and to make use of them for Trans∣portation of the other Forces. The design succeeded very prosperously; for the Turks taking these Heyducks to be their Friends, were easily surprized and cut to pieces; and two very great Barges were seized and brought over to the other side, on which Hoffkirchen and Zerini embarking them∣selves with Three hundred Dragoons, pas∣sed the River, and joyned the Heyducks, who were far engaged in a pursuit of the Enemy; who being surprized, had aban∣doned Proot, together with the Works and Trenches which they had made; of which taking possession, made a speedy passage for the remaining Party of the Germans,
and Heyducks. In the Heat of this Action, Two hundred of the Enemy, who were Two thousand strong, were cut in pieces, and many Women and Children were made Prisoners; the Christian Soldiers gained a considerable Booty in this Action; for the Turks being surprized, had not time to save any thing of their Moveables and Ri∣ches; and with them they had the Fortune to set Two hundred Christians at liberty, amongst which was a Lieutenant of the Re∣giment of the Upper Rhine, with several other subaltern Officers. Count Hoffkirchen looking on this place to be an advantageous Post for raising a Bridge of Communication between that side and Sclavonia, and that in Four days they could at any time be carried down the Stream to Belgrade; It was resolved to main∣tain that Post until other Orders should come from P. Lewis, to whom an Express was sent to know his pleasure: And in the mean time, they repaired the Trenches, and improved the Works with better For∣tifications than those which the Turks had made; whereby they put themselves into a condition to resist any force, which the Turks could bring against them in a short time;Hffkir∣chen at∣tcked by Topal Pasha, and hereof in two or three days af∣terwards they had an occasion to make some Tryal; for Topal Pasha having joyn∣ed himself with Two other Pashas lately come from Adrianople, came upon them with an Army to the Number of Eight thousand men; and having intrenched him∣self at the distance of about Three hundred Paces from the Palancha,Who is repulsed. he assaulted that, and the Trenches about Midnight; but were bravely repulsed by the continual Fire, which the Christians made upon them; so that drawing off at some little distance, they brought Two Guns about Break of day in the Morning, with design to batter the place; in which were no more than Three hundred Germans, Horse and Foot, and about One thousand Heyducks; because that Hoffkirchen had detached a great part of his Forces towards Possega, to Convoy some Waggons of Provisions and Ammunition, of which they stood in need. The Enemy being well advised hereof, and of the weak∣ness of the Garrison within, returned to make a new Attack, covering their approach with Boards, Waggons, and Barrels of Earth. In the mean time the Attachment sent to Possega returning, were observed by the Turk;The Turks endeavour to be at Hoffkir∣chen out of Proot. who resolving to hinder their Union, furiously made another Assault, with Two thousand brave Janisaries, and as many Spahees; who having filled up the shallow Ditch with Bushes,  Boards, and Rubbish, ascended as high as to the Parapet, where they planted Two of the Colours belonging to Topal Pasha, near to Three of the Impe∣rial Ensigns: Whereupon began a very fu∣rious Fight, with Swords and Scymeters at handy blows; and the Imperialists mix∣ing with the Turks, threw them headlong into the Ditch and Trenches, killing in this Action with very little loss on their side above Five hundred Turks,Are repul∣sed. and taking Three Ensigns. After which a Sally was made with so much vigour and bravery, that the Turks were repulsed, and droven out of their new Works, which they had made near the Banks of the River. In the mean time the Detachment which had lately been made, returned and passed the Water; with which the Forces in the Palancha being reinforced,With great loss. made a Sally up∣on the Enemy, both with Horse and Foot; and intirely beat them out of all their Ap∣proaches and Retrenchments, with the loss of their Baggage and Waggons: This Action continued for the space of Four and twenty Hours; in which, and other Attacks before, the Turks lost above Twelve hundred men. This Post was maintained for several days,  and until such time as P. Lewis of Baden sent Orders to Hoffkirchen to with∣draw his Troops; it not being advisable to hazard such brave men in a Post, which could not easily be maintained; and at so far a distance, as Four days Journey from the main Body of the Army,Proot de∣molished. C. Hoffkir∣chen abandoned the place accordingly; and having sacked it, set Fire to it, and passed the River with a very rich Booty. The particulars of this Retreat not being well understood,July. caused some Disturbance at Possega, where it was reported, that the Turks in a Body of Fifteen hundred Men, had passed the Save; and having defeated Hoff-kirchen, intended to dispute the Pas∣sage with Prince Lewis of Baden: Who be∣ing in great Concernment for Hoff-kirchen, was come as far as Possega to enquire after him; and to receive true Information,Piccolo∣mini sent in quest of Hoffkir∣chen. he dispatched General Piccolomini with Three hundred Horse, to look after him; but they Marching by different Ways, missed of each other: When the General came to Proot, where he discovered some Parties of the Enemy, which cover'd themselves with∣in those Ruins, having first broken down all the Bridges near to that Palanca, he passed the Water, and boldly attempted the Turks, imagining their numbers to be less than they were. The Turks guessing on the other side, that these Forces were some advanced Troops of the main Body of the Army, retired themselves into the old Fort over against Proot,He retreats. where having no Can∣non, they plied their Small-shot very plen∣tifully upon the Imperialists, by which it
being discover'd, that the Turks were at least Two thousand in number; Piccolomini made a very skilful Retreat,He Re∣treats with much Art, and good Conduct. according to the Military Order, and returned towards Possega, where he found Hoff-kirchen, Prince Lewis, and all the other other Troops hap∣pily joyned. The Troops having refreshed themselves one day in Possega, and being provided with all things requisite for their Sub∣sistence,Prince Lewis Marches towards Gradiska. Prince Lewis began his March thence towards Gradiska on the 24th of July, carrying with him four Demy-culver∣ins, and some Field Pieces; resolving to pass the Save at Sisseck in Croatia, and joyn there with a Body of Croats, and endea∣vour to Attack the Enemy, if possible: And here we will leave him for a while on this Expedition, and return to the great Camp, where the Elector of Bavaria was Arrived, to the great Joy and Triumph of the whole Army. The Elector of Bavaria prepares his March for Bel∣grade.The same Evening that the Elector enter∣ed the Camp at Tiska, he resolved next Morning to proceed towards Belgrade, and accordingly he made a strong Detachment under the Command of Count Dunewalt to Advance, and discover the Countenance of the Enemy, who (as it was reported) with a Body of Twenty thousand Men, had fortified the Banks of the Save all along the Shoar, as far as to the Danube, with Tim∣bers, and Ditches, and Palisadoes, in the same manner as they had done the yeat before under Esseck; besides which, Tekely had formed a Camp with such Advantage, as that he could in a very short time come in to their Assistance. August. 1688.The Army having the 5th of August En∣camped at Tiska, continued their March next day towards the Save, and made a Halt at Bagliutz, about half a League di∣stant from the River;The Can∣non, &c. joyns the Army. where the Artillery lately brought by Water from Buda, toge∣ther with the Baggage, and the Boats on Wheels, with other Materials necessary for making a Bridge, joyned the Army that Evening under a Good Convoy of Horse and Foot. About the same time a Prisoner was brought to the Camp, who upon Ex∣amination declared, That the Ottoman Army was composed of about Twenty five thou∣sand Men, of which Twenty five Cham∣bers of Janisaries, consisting of about Four or five hundred each, were employed to finish the Intrenchments they had made on the other side of the Save, to hinder the Pas∣sage of the Christian Army:Resolved to pass the River. A Counsel of War being held thereupon, it was resolved to force the Passage; and to send a good Body of Men to burn the Bridge, which the Turks had Built near Belgrade: But in case that Design succeeded not, then they were to Post themselves as near the Bridge as they could, both to give the Alarum on that side, and also to secure the Convoys which were coming to the Army from Pe∣ter Waradin; for security of which, the Detachment of Four thousand Men, under Dunewalt was also appointed: In the mean time the gross Body of the Army moved towards the Save, directing their March towards the Island of Zingar or Swallows, which the Turks had possessed, but fled,Attempts to pass the Save. and quitted it upon a Report, of the near Ap∣proach of the Christian Army, so that the Imperialists without any Opposition pos∣sessed themselves of that Island; the Foot passed over in Boats, but the Horse forded the Water: But the great difficulty lay on the other side, where the Water was not only deeper; but the opposite Banks de∣fended so well by the Enemies Cannon and Small-shot, that there seemed an impossibi∣lity almost to pass; and the more, because that Tekely lay Encamped on the other side, joyned to a strong Body of Turks, who lay ready to receive them at their landing, and to give them an unpleasing Welcome. All which being consider'd; it was resolved to Alarum the Turks that Night in divers places, whilst Count Serini General of the Bavarian Forces, assisted with the Generals Stirum and Aspremont, should with Six thousand Men endeavour to pass the River at a good distance from the place, where the chief Alarum was made; which was executed with that Care and Conduct, that the Success proved answerable thereunto; for the Six thousand Men having safely passed without any Opposition, posted themselves with the Chevaux de Frise chain∣ed and linked together, which served like a Turn-pike against the Enemies Horse and Foot, until the rest of the Army could fol∣low. But so soon as it was clear Day, they were furiously attacked by Eight thousand Janisaries, who were as warmly received,The Chri∣stian Army passes the Save. and forced to Retreat, leaving Six hundred of their Men dead upon the place, with the loss only of One hundred and twenty Men on the Christian side; during this En∣gagement which lasted about two Hours, a Bridge was laid over the River with such Expedition, that the whole Army passed that Day, except only the Cannon, and the Heavy Baggage; which were also Trans∣ported over without any delay. The most difficult Point of the whole Campaign be∣ing now overcome, the Elector of Bavaria distributed Two thousand Ducats amongst those who had signalized themselves in this Action; and without any demur marched towards Belgrade, from whence he was not distant above three days March. Had the Turks been Men of Courage or
Conduct, they might easily have hindred the Christian Army from passing the River; but indeed to speak the Truth, they had lost all that Bravery and Spirit, by which they had gained so many Kingdoms in the East, and advanced so far into the Domini∣ons of Europe:The Turks discoura∣ged. But being now dispirited by unfortunate losses of their Cities and strong Holds, and by Over-throws and De∣feats in Battle, and more especially by their own intestine Mutinies and Dissentions, in which most of their brave Men perished; they became so sunk in their Spirits, that they were not half the Men, that they for∣merly had been; but being struck with a Consternation, as their Enemies were rai∣sed and flushed with Victory and Triumph,  they Cowardly gave back, and lost the ad∣vantage, which Nature had given them by the Waters for a defence. The Elector de∣signed to pursue the Enemy, before he At∣tempted the Siege of Belgrade; and to raise his Camp with the rising of the Moon, then entring into the last Quarter; when he was hinder'd by a violent Storm of Wind and Rain, with Thunder and Lightning which endanger'd the Bridge, and lasted until break of Day of the 10th in the Morning:August. The Turks interpreting this Storm, as a bad Omen unto themselves, a∣bandoned their Camp, leaving many Thou∣sand Heads of Cattle dispersed in the Fields,The Turks Fly. with all their Instruments for Intrenching; and fled with such Precipitation and Hast, that the Christian Generals judging it impossible to overtake them, directed their Course by the nearest way to Belgrade. Prince Eu∣geny of Savoy was Commanded by his Ele∣ctoral Highness, to advance with his Re∣giment and some Guards, towards the City, to take a view of the Enemy, and dis∣cover in what order they were lodged in their Trenches: The Inhabitants of the City having received the affrighting News of the near Approach of the Christian Army, had the time of three or four days, to Embark their useless People, with the best of their Moveables, and richest Goods on a Thousand Boats; with which they sailed down the Stream of the River,The Citi∣zens of Belgrade abandon their Dwel∣lings. land∣ing afterwards at several places, where Friends or Relations, or other Covenien∣cies invited them: And in the mean time the remaining Garrison set Fire to the Su∣burbs, and reduced all to Ashes. Not∣withstanding which, the Flight was so con∣fused and hasty, that many of the Inhabi∣tants with their Wives and Children, had not time to Convey themselves away; of which some were killed, and many made Captives:  Only some Jews and Rascians remained behind, who being habited in the Turkish fashion, had been exposed to the Fury of the Soldiery, had not the Genero∣sity of the Prince restrained the Heat of their Martial Fury. Soon afterwards the whole Army came up,August. and Sacked and Plun∣dered the Suburbs,A Fire consumes the Su∣burbs. sparing neither Mosque nor House: And thô the Fire, and Flames were very terrible; yet the Soldiers gained more Plunder and Booty in those Suburbs, than they had done in all Buda; because they had the fortune to surprize whole Bales of Goods, and Moveables ready Packed up, which the Owners in their Flight had not time to carry away. How∣soever, some of these Plunderers being o∣ver-intent on their Prey, were surprized by a Party of the Enemy, and either killed, or made Captives. No time was lost in opening the Tren∣ches, into which Major General Steinau, and Count Ottingen enter'd on the 21st of August, and Commanded there that Night, but could not advance much by reason of the continual Rains. Howsoever,The Tren∣ches open'd. in two or three days the Trenches were finished, and three Batteries were raised, and furnished with the Heavy Cannon, which on the 25th arrived in the Camp.August. 1688. Twenty six Pieces were immediately mounted, and began to play upon the Castle; and thô they had raised their Batteries, as high as was possible; yet the Ruins of the Suburbs lay so much in the way, that the Shot could not reach the bottom of the Wall, till the Way was cleared by the Pioniers; and then two new Batteries more being raised,Batteries raise and all the remaining Artillery plan∣ted thereon, they ply'd incessantly on the Walls of the Castle with great Shot and Bombs, in the mean time the Enemy was not idle, but returned the like into the Christian Camp, making frequent Sallies with much Bravery; in which the Germans lost more Men than the Turks, amongst which was the Count of Ligneville, Colo∣nel of Foot, and Adjutant General, who by a Shot received in the Trenches died immediately. The Town, and Castle of Belgrade be∣ing in this manner formally invested, it was believed, That it could not hold out long, by reason of the Weakness of the Garrison, which consisted of no more than Three thousand and five hundred Men, Commanded by Ibrahim late Pasha of Bag∣dat or Babylon, who being a Brave and Va∣liant Soldier, resolved to maintain the place to the last Extremity, giving out for En∣couragement of his Garrison, that power∣ful Succours were coming to their Relief, under the Command of Osman Pasha of Aleppo; but this Report, grounded on some stragling Troops belonging to Tekeli, seen in the Neighbour-hood of Semandria,
gave some hopes to the fainting Garrison; but General Dunewalt being sent against Tekeli, with a strong Detachment of Horse, soon drove him from those Quarters. The chief Force of the Turks being no more than Twenty five thousand Men, under Com∣mand of Osman Pasha of Aleppo, lay En∣camped near Nissa, whilst Yeghen was re∣tired with his Horse (for his Foot had de∣serted him) near to Sophia, destroying and consuming the Forage round the Coun∣try. The Turks Sue for Peace.The Turks finding themselves in this low and helpless Condition, inclined to Coun∣sels tending to Peace, and reassumed their former Resolution of sending their two fore∣mentioned Ambassadors, Zulficar Effendi, and the Interpreter Mauro-cordato to beg a Peace (to whom as we have said, Yeghen gave lately a stop) a Method never before practised by the Ottoman Emperors, since the beginning of their Empire: But the Misfortunes of War, and the Miseries of their own intestine Dissentions had bowed their Hearts, and Haughty Thoughts to submissive and humble Prayers for Peace; in order to which Osman Pasha of Aleppo wrote this following Letter to the Elector of Bavaria, brought to him by the Hand of a Chiaus. TO him, who is Dear to God, and ranked in chief Degree amongst the Princes of Germany, powerful in People and Govern∣ment, Famous and Renowned in all Parts, Duke Maximilian Emanuel, Elector of Ba∣varia, and General of the Army of the Em∣peror of the Romans, unto whom may God grant that Health, which I wish unto him. After Salutations premised. Be it known unto you, That one of the Chief Officers of our Emperor of the Turks, who now Reigns, is dispatched with an important Letter to your most powerful Emperor: This Ambassa∣dor is a Person highly esteemed amongst us, both for his Wisdom and Vertue, whose name is Zulficar Effendi; with whom goes also joyned in the same Commission Alexander Mauro-cordato, Interpreter to the Port for secret Affairs, a Person of singular Reputa∣tion and Fame, and a Christian by Profession. These two Persons are arrived at this place from Constantinople with design to proceed far∣ther to your Camp; in case they may be re∣ceived with the same Honourable, Safe and Courteous Entertainment, as hath by ancient Custom, and laudable Practice been shewn to those of their Character: They have with them about One hundred Persons belonging to their Retinue, for whom that safe Convoy and Pasports may be dispatched, I have sent you this Letter, to request such Security for them as is necessary: When they draw near to your Camp, they will send again to you, to the end, that a Convoy may come from your Army to meet and receive them from the Pasha, who is sent with Troops from hence: That so the Respect, and Safety of Ambassa∣dors observed by all Nations, as is fit and necessary may remain in it's ancient Lustre. For you know how careful both sides ought to be of their safe Passage. Prosperity to those, who follow the true Direction. Signed, Osman Pasha of Aleppo. Given in the Army near Nissa. The Elector of Bavaria's Answer. To Osman Pasha of Aleppo. Greeting, &c. WE have received your Letter from the Camp at Nissa, wherein you give us to understand, That an Ambassador by name Zulficar Effendi, and the first Interpreter, have Orders from your Emperor to come to our Army: Now althô we being inclined to Mi∣litary Actions, might well refuse to receive them here; which none could take amiss in this present heat of Affairs, or might put off their Reception until another time, since We judge that their Proposals will little agree with our present Intentions: Yet being moved by a Christian Compassion, We do Grant that they may come to the Army: And We will fa∣vourably hear, what your Emperor hath Com∣manded them to propose unto us. To which end We have Commanded that a Pasport shall be prepared for their Security and delivered to the Persons, who brought your Letter. We have also given Orders to the Governour of Semandria, that in the manner directed him, and with a sufficient number of Troops, he Con∣duct them safe to our Army. Upon which they may firmly Rely. Given at our Camp before Belgrade. August 23d 1688. In pursance of this Letter, Orders were given to General Caraffa to go to Titul, and receive the Ambassadors; but in the mean time the Siege proceeded, and Attacks were made with all the Fury and Vigour imaginable; many Pieces of the Cannon, which came from Buda, being cast in hast, burst one after another; so that to supply their defect, the Elector sent for most of the Cannon from Semandria; which being rai∣sed, and planted, did great Execution; and throwing Bombs and Carcasses from Fifteen Mortars at a time, struck Terror into the Defendants, and set Fire to divers parts of the Fortress. Howsoever,The Turks throw Bombs and Carcasses. the Turks man∣fully applied themselves to quench the Flames, and returned the Cannon-shot and
Bombs, with other artificial Fires made with Pitch, and Sulfur upon the Besiegers, in the same manner, as they had practised in the defence of Buda. They Sprang also one Mine, which venting about eight or ten Paces backwards, did no farther mischief, than the killing of one Man; but this be∣ing followed by a Storm of Bombs, one of which falling into a Magazine, where some Hundreds of Weights of Powder, it blew all into the Air, without other Mischief than the Death of eight Common Soldi∣ers. The Turks believing that this Blow, and Springing of the last Mine, had caused some disorder in the Trenches, made a violent Sally,They make a sally, and are beaten back. with their Scemyters in their Hands in∣to the Approaches; but being strongly op∣posed by a Captain who Commanded a Hundred Men, reinforced also by some Parties of Strasser's Regiment, they were repulsed with the loss of Forty of their Men, eight Imperialists only being killed. The Fury of the Turks being hereby much abated; Differences, as is usual, arose be∣tween the Commanders and the Souldiers; the first seemed resolved to defend the For∣tress to the last extremity, and last drop of their Blood, knowing that they could not long out-live any Surrender made upon Composition: But the Soldiers, who could save their Lives on easier Terms, were de∣sirous to be freed from the Showers of Fire, which being continually poured upon them, did in the Night resemble the dreadful Flames of Vesuvius or Mongibello. The Elector of Bavaria being well assu∣red in the mean time, that the Conquest of that Castle would shortly be added to the Triumphs of Caesar,The Duke of Loraine comes to the Camp. had time, with much quiet of mind, and without any distraction to give a Magnificent Reception to the Duke of Loraine; who being now in some measure recovered from his late Sickness, could not absent himself from Martial Ex∣ercises, at least from being a Spectator, or bearing some share in this Heroick Enter∣prize. News being come, that the Duke of Loraine, having left his Royal Consort the Queen at Buda, was not far distant, the Elector accompanied with the Duke of Mantoua, and several of the General Offi∣cers, went to him at the Foot of the Bridge, which was made over the Save, and there received him with the joyful Salutation of all the Cannon which were planted in the Lines of Circumvallation,Is received by the Ele∣ctor of Bavaria. and by the Sol∣diery drawn up in several Battalions; and having walked over all the Lines, and ob∣served the disposition of the Siege; all which being well approved, he was conducted to the Bavarian Tents, where he was sum∣ptuously treated by the Elector. After which, whilst these Noble Generals were viewing the approaches, the Turks sprang a second Mine under the main Battery; not far from the persons of these great Com∣manders; who being reserved by the Pro∣vidence of God to reap more Laurels, re∣mained untouched amidst that danger. How∣soever the Turks thinking thereby to have gained some great advantage, made a brisk Sally, with Colours flying, and Drums beat∣ing, drawn up in posture of Battel:The Turks spring ano∣ther Mine, and make a sally. The Swedes and Franconians having then that place allotted them to Guard, gave way up∣on the first attack of the Enemy, and aban∣doned their Post, leaving their Officers to the mercy of the Enemy, who were mise∣rably slaughtered by them. After which the Turks advancing to the Left, were so warmly received,August. 1688. that they were repulsed with the loss of many of their Soldiers: Soon after which these Illustrious Dukes entred the approaches from whence the Turks had been beaten, and bestowed due Praises on those Soldiers, who so bravely and valiantly had behaved themselves to the Reproach of those, who cowardly re∣treated. After which the Duke of Loraine retired to the Quarters of his own Regi∣ment of Horse, than which he had at that time no other Command in the Army, the whole conduct and General direction being entirely in the power of the Elector of Bavaria. The Breaches being now made, some wi∣der than others, the 5th of September was appointed for a day of a General Assault; which being come,Septem. 1688. the whole Army remained in a readiness to make the on-set, and exe∣cute the last Orders of their Generals;An At∣tack in∣tended. when unexpectedly a Bomb from the Enemies Works fell amongst certain Barrels of Powder; which blowing up, over-turned the Works which belonged to Mines then preparing; and burned in a furious man∣ner all things near it, killing divers Soldiers; and amongst the rest was Count Guido of Staremberg, and Count Berzetti, Chief Di∣rector of the Mines. This Fire was follow∣ed by such a terrible Rain, which continu∣ed all that day, and part of the Night fol∣lowing, that it was impossible to execute the intended Attack; but afterwards the Weather clearing up, the Mines were re∣paired again in such manner, that at break of day in the Morning, Fire was given to them with so good success, that the Ditch was filled up, and as it were, levelled as much as was needful. The Attack was ordered to be made in Four several Quarters, that in the Front was commanded by the Elector himself: That on the Right-hand by the Prince of
Commercy, on the Left by the Dragoons of General Heusler, and that next the Wa∣ter by Pini Sergeant Major of the Regi∣ment of Loraine. All things being in this manner disposed in order for a general Assault, about Nine a Clock in the Morning the Signal was gi∣ven to make the Attack, by Firing a Piece of Cannon in the Front of the Line of Cir∣cumvallation, which was answered by a Shot to the Right, and soon afterwards by Two others to the Left; which being the Signal to make the Attack, the Assailants entred the Ditch, where they were recei∣ceived by infinite Vollies of Shot pouring upon them from all sides;Belgrade Stormed. which giving no stop to the Bravery and Courage of the Soldiers, they mounted to the top of the Breach, thô the Earth was become soft and slippery by the late Rains. From the height of this Breach, they took a Prospect of greater difficulties still to overcome; for they were now to des∣cend into another Ditch, which the Turks had digged at the Foot of the inside of the Wall; and there to wrench up or beat down the Palisadoes, which were planted on the top of the Ditch; and this was to be ex∣ecuted in Contempt and Despite of all the Shot, which the Besieged shower'd from all sides upon them; the which was sufficient to intimidate and cool the Courage of the most valiant Heroes,Count Scherffem∣berg killed. especially when at the beginning of this danger they saw their Leader Count Scherffemberg, and soon af∣terwards their Colonel Count Emanuel de Furstemburg, who entred into his place, both killed before them, as was also Count Henric of Staremberg: And indeed the German Soldiers beginning a little to give Ground, were in danger totally to lose all the advantage which they had gained, had not the Elector himself exposed his own Person to all the Shot of the Enemy;The Ele∣ctor stands on the Breach. and standing upon the Breach with his Sword drawn, threatned the Life of any one who should dare to retire; and accordingly some were killed for the Terror of others. The Soldiers animated by the Example of their General, and touched with a sense of Honour, descended with new re∣solution into the Ditch; and being well seconded by others, they mounted to the Top, where the Palisadoes were Planted. The Turks terrified with so bold and surprizing an Attempt,The Turks Capitu∣late. fled trembling from the face of their Enemies, and crowded into the Castle, between which and the Town, there was only a single Bridge; where displaying a White Flag, they de∣manded to Capitulate for their Lives: But some of the more desperate Assailants ha∣ving no regard to Flags, or Colours, or what was acting, ascended to the Tops of the Houses, and into Windows, and en∣tred in at the Port-holes made for the Guns, where they made a most horrible Massacre of all that stood before them, without re∣gard to Age or Sex. This Success was in a great measure ob∣tained by the other Attack,The P. of Commercy enters on the other side. commanded by the Prince of Commercy; who thô wounded in the Shoulder by a Musquet-Bullet, did yet overcome all difficulties, and enter victoriously within the Walls. On that side howsoever, where General Heusler commanded with his Dragoons, the opposition was not so great; so that laying aside the Ladders which they had prepared for Scaling the Walls, they went directly to the Gate,G. Heusler forces a Gate. and in spite of all their Shot fixed a Petard thereunto, which intirely forced it from its Bolts and Hinges, and laid all open to the entrance of the Soldiers; howsoever at some little distance from the first, another Wall presented it self, well guarded, and defended with Sol∣diers, who made continual Vollies upon the Assailants; to which there was an Iron-gate to pass, before entrance could be made; and that so strong, that it was judged al∣most impossible to be overthrown, during the Heat of this Action. Howsoever the Dragoons of Savoy being encouraged by their Prince, (who but some days before had been wounded in the Knee) leaped on the Wall, which was not very high, and desperately threw them∣selves into the City; by which means be∣coming Masters of the Gate, they opened it, and let in a whole Torrent of the Ger∣man Forces, who in a short time covered all the Streets with the Bodies of their Enemies: Howsoever this Action cost the Lives of above One hundred Dragoons of Savoy,Massacre and Slaugh∣ter of the Turks. with some of their principal Offi∣cers, amongst which was the Count of Massel; and General Heusler had his Thumb struck off with a Musquet-Bullet, which hindred nothing in prosecution of this Victory. Many Turks endeavouring to escape the fury of the Soldiers by passing the River in Boats, fell into the hands of the Ger∣mans, who gave them no better Quarter, than they had done to those who defended the Breach.
All being now subdued, and subjected to Victorious Arms of the Christians, no place stood out, but only a small Trench behind the Castle, to which the Pasha or Commander in Chief, with the Aga of the Janisaries, and some Officers had retired themselves; and with them they took those Slaves which they had maintained for their Service in the Castle: The Sol∣diers in their fury, not being satiated with the Blood they had already spilt, were dis∣posed to bathe their Swords yet farther in the Bodies of this small remainder of their Enemies,The Pasha and other Officers made Pri∣soners. and were ready to have executed, and wreak their final Rage on the Pasha, and Officers, when the Clemency of the most Serene Elector, being moved by the Cries and Tears of the Christian Captives, at their Petitions and Prayers, spared the Lives of the Turks; being contented to see the Turks bound in the same Chains which they had newly taken from the Christians: And yet the horrible Massacre of the Sword did not cease in other parts of the City, all being filled with Confusion and Cruelty; when on a sudden a terrible Fire broke out in the lower Town, which burned with so much Violence, that the Conquerors as well as the Conquered were willing to escape out at the Gates. The Cruelty of the Sol∣diers.It was grievous to see poor Old men made Prisoners, dragged by their Beards, and Women and Maidens covered with Blood and,  Dirt drawn by the Hairs of the Head, and made the Sport and Pastime of Military Insolence. In Fine, the Fire being extinguish∣ed, Slaughter ceased, and about Noon the City and Castle were intirely sub∣dued. On the 6th of September when His Ele∣ctoral Highness, and the other Generals rode Triumphantly into the City, behold∣ing the dead Bodies, which filled the Streets, the Ruins of the Houses, and the Destructi∣on which the Bombs had made; And considering these Successes to have pro∣ceeded intirely from the Blessing, and Divine assistance of the God of Hosts; His Electoral Highness on the 7th of September,Sept. 7. Te Deum sung. caused Te Deum to be sung in one of the Pleasure-houses belonging to the Grand Seignior, situate on the Decli∣vity of a Hill, where the Elector thought fit to take up his Lodgings. And a Ca∣puchin after saying Mass, was ordered by a short and devout Sermon to move the minds of the Soldiery to return Thanks unto God, who was the Giver of Victory; and to implore the Divine Benediction on the farther progress of their Arms. After which, all the Cannon of the Fortress, and of the Camp were Fired Three times, with loud Vive's resounding the Fame of Leopold, and Maximilian Emanuel. The day following the Elector invited all the Generals, and Chief Officers of the Army to a sumptuous Banquet, at which also the Turkish Ambassadors happened to be present; for whom, and his Retinue, (as we mentioned before) the Pasha of Aleppo had desired a Pass. When this Ambassador approached near the Camp, he was strangely surprized to hear all things so quiet,The Turkish Ambassa∣dor comes to the Camp. no Noise of Guns or other Instruments of War; but coming yet nearer, his Eyes convinced him (when he saw the Imperial Eagles advanced on the Walls) that the Town was taken. News being brought to the Elector, that the Ambassador was come, he was con∣ducted with his Interpreter Mauro-cordato, and his Followers on Horseback into the Court-yard, of the House where the Ele∣ctor was lodged; and there being alighted, he was conducted up Stairs by Two Gen∣tlemen, to the Chamber where the Elector was seated, with whom at his first Entrance, he passed some Complements of Thanks, for the Passport and Convoy which he had so obligingly bestowed upon him. After which he was led into a large Hall,Is Feasted with the Generals. where a sumptuous Table was spread. The Elector took the Upper-end, at his Right-hand was placed the Duke of Mantoua, on his Left the Ottoman Ambassador; and by his side the Interpreter was seated. By the Duke were placed the Generals Caprara, Dunewalt, Heusler, Rabattin; Prince Charles, Philip of Hannover, the Vice-Commissary Falchenhan, Count of Oetting, Sauran, Stirum, Gronsfelt, Monte∣cucoli, Palfi, and Sereni; which filled and crowned the Table with chearful Counte∣nances, whilst the Ambassador drooping in his Spirits, could not hide and suppress his Sorrow from appearing in his looks: The jollity of these Victorious Officers, was a Ponyard to his Heart, which very ill agreed with so much Festivity and Mirth of his Enemies; and of the principal Offi∣cers, who in very rich Habits encircled the Table. Howsoever being constrained to say something, which might not betray his dejection of mind; casting his Eyes round upon the Company, he said to the Elector, That he was astonished at the ap∣pearance of so many handsome and accom∣plished
Personages: But one thing he observed, That the Emperor of the Romans was served by Young Generals; at which he could not much wonder; for when he considered, how they daily exposed themselves to the most des∣perate dangers, there seemed an impossibility almost for them to survive till old Age: Thus far it had been well, if he had stopped at this period of Complement. But pursuing his Discourse farther, he told them, that the Year before he had been at the Battel of Hatschan. To which the Elector Replied, That certainly he must have had a good Horse, meaning to es∣cape and run away; which caused some Laughter. During the time of Dinner, the Trum∣pets, Haut-boys, and other Instruments were sounded; and Healths drank round in full Cups of Wine; to the Emperor; to the continuance of prosperous Successes to his Arms; and the Third to the Health of the Ottoman Emperor; To all which the Ambassa∣dor did reason in Sherbet of Lemmons Wine, being both against his Religion and his Cu∣stom to Drink. The Fourth Health was to the Elector; the Fifth to the Duke of Man∣toua; the Sixth to the Ambassador, and then to all brave Soldiers; and after ma∣ny other Glasses, they concluded all with a Health to a Good Peace, or a Glorious War, with which, breaking their Glasses, the Feast ended with the Day. The taking of the Town, and City of Belgrade, was of a most fatal Importance to the Turks; for thereby the Way was laid opened to Adrianople, and Constantinople, no Garrisons lay between them and Belgrade, nor Forces to oppose the March of the Im∣perial Arms; unless Scarcity and want of Provisions through a desolate Country, in many places full of Rocks and Mountains, to be passed, should bring more difficulty to the progress of a Victorious Army, than the Troops of their Enemies. Nor did this Campaigne end as yet with the Conquest of Belgrade, being seconded by others of equal advantage in Bosnia, under the auspicious Conduct of that Re∣nowned and Fortunate General,Topal sig∣nifie Lume. Prince Lewis of Baden, whom we left lately at Possega, with design to attack Topal, Pasha of Bosnia, who had Encamp∣ed himself under Tervat or Terwent, near the River of Ucraine, about Five Miles distant from Proot, which Prince Lewis had fortified, to facilitate his passage more easily into Bosnia, and to secure the Communication between the Neighbouring Forts: And there also passed a Bridge over the Save; which being finished,1688. Septem. on the Third of September, he caused his Baggage to pass over, and the next day followed with his whole Army, in hopes to have drawn the Pasha from his Encampment; of whose Number the Prince had no very good Account;P. Lewis passes the Save. but being reported to be much less than they were, the Prince marched the Fourth Instant in the Evening silently, and without Noise to assault the Enemy in the Camp; and having passed that Night through many strait and difficult Ways, they arrived next Morning by break of day within sight of the advanced Guards of the Enemy, who gave the first Alarum; up∣on which the Pashas was the first to Mount on Horseback, and immediately drew forth his Troops, placing them in order of Bat∣tel; the Horse into Two Wings, and the Foot in the middle.The Turks assault the Germans. The Force conducted by Prince Lewis, was no stronger in all than Three thousand Horse, and Three hun∣dred Croats; but the Turks by several Re∣cruits which had lately joyned them, were in all Fifteen thousand Fighting-men; by which inequality of Numbers, the Turks judging themselves secure of Victory, furiously at∣tacked the Prince, who had also divided his Squadrons of Horse into Two Wings, the Right Commanded by Piccolomini, and the Left by Count Castelli, both Generals of Battalia. The Turks at first falling in with all their power, and Numbers on the Left-wing, were Three times bravely repulsed by Ca∣stelli; when Piccolamini coming in to their Assistance, the Fight became so hot and fierce, that the Christians and the Turks re∣mained for half an Hour so mixed together, that having not time to Re-Charge their Fire-Arms, they fought only at handy blows, opening the way with their Swords. At length the Turks being overcome by the unparallel'd Valour of the Imperialists, the Turkish Horse began to retire,The Turk∣ish Horse put to Flight, And the Foot expo∣sed to dan∣ger. leaving their Infantry naked, and exposed to the Fury of the Enemy, of whom the greatest Slaughter was made, that ever was known, between Two such small Bodies. And indeed, Reflexion being made on the Numbers of the Imperialists, it will appear a Miracle that Three thousand three hun∣dred men should defeat Fifteen thousand, killing Five thousand on the place, amongst which was the General Topal Pasha, Two Agas, and the Kahya to the Pasha: The Foot made a brave defence for some time;
but at length were dispersed: About Two hundred of them were drowned in the Ri∣ver, and lost in the Bogs, and such as esca∣ped the Sword, submitted to Quarter. The Imperialists had the advantage to be co∣vered by the side of a Hill, when the Ene∣my attacked them. In this great Action the Imperialists lost not more than One hundred and fifty men, amongst which was Captain Maraville, and Two Lieutenants; the Prince August of Han∣nover was slightly Wounded in the Hand by a Lance, and the Count de Cronsfelt, Sergeant-Major of the Regiment of Holstein in the Neck. Prince August was Colonel of a Regiment of Curassiers, and conducted a Detachment of Two thousand men, with which he was commanded to march from Peter-Waradin, and joyn with Prince Lewis of Baden; the which he performed, and behaved himself with incomparable Valour, which is natural to that Illustrious Family. P. Lewis returns to Proot.In this manner Prince Lewis Exalted with Glory, and laden with Spoils, returned with many Standards and Colours taken from the Enemy, to his former Camp at Proot; where Dedicating the Day follow∣ing to the Repose and Refreshment of his Soldiery, he retorned Thanks to the God of Hosts, for so signal a Victory, which happened to fall out on the very same day, that the Elector of Bavaria sang the Te Deum at Belgrade for the Conquest and Sub∣jection of that place. News sent to Vienna.These Two great and signal Actions be∣ing performed so near to each other in time, filled all Vienna and Christendom, (France only excepted) with extraordinary Joy and Triumph. Prince Charles of Vaudemont was chosen by the Elector to be the joyful Mes∣senger of this Glorious Action of taking Belgrade,  to the Imperial Court, which was immediately followed by Baron Schlick, dispatched by the Prince of Baden, with Advice of that wonderful Victory obtained over Topal the Pasha of Bosnia. The French K. obstructs the Wars against the Turks.In this glorious manner did the Cam∣paigne end in Hungary, which might have been farther improved, and a progress made by the Imperial Arms to the utmost extent of those Dominions which the Turks possess in Europe, had not the most Christian King, being displeased at the prosperous Course of the Imperial Arms against the Turk, thought it time to make a diversion by waging War upon Germany. And indeed it had been no wonder to have seen the Imperial Eagles, as a conse∣quence of the present Consternation, Erect∣ed on the Walls of Constantinople, and the Turks driven over the Bosphorus to possess their more Ancient possessions in Asia, had not the Menaces of the French King recal∣led the Elector of Bavaria from his intend∣ed Enterprize, which was very probable and likely to have succeeded:The Rascians in Arms against the Turks. For the Rascians were got into a Body of Eight thousand men between Semandria and Nissa, being, besides their old Feuds, lately exasperated by the burning of their Houses, and destroy∣ing of their Fields by Yeghen Pasha, which he did to hinder the Imperialists from fol∣lowing him in his late Flight from Bel∣grade: In revenge of which, they desired the Germans to furnish them with experien∣ced Commanders, to direct and discipline them; not questioning but to become Ma∣sters of all that Country, and to possess Sophia it self; promising also to bring the Bulgarians and Greeks into the Interest of the Emperor. But the Elector of Bavaria, as we have said, being obliged to return,The Elector of Bavaria returns to Vienna. he arrived at Vienna the 18th day of September, and Three days afterwards was followed by the Duke of Loraine, who by reason of his late indisposition, could not move so vigo∣rously as the Elector. The arrival of the Elector at Vienna, hap∣pened on the Day of Thanksgiving for the late Successes;A Solemn Day of Thanksgi∣ving. where nothing was omit∣ted to render that Day solemn and full of Joy and Triumph. The Procession came forth from the Royal Church of the Au∣gustines discalced, and proceeded to the Ca∣thedral of St. Stephen's, being followed by all the Clergy, Gentry, Nobility, and Mi∣nisters of the Court; and last of all with Exemplary Devotion and Piety, came the Young King of Hungary, and their Impe∣rial Majesties, attended with the Queen of Poland, and the Electress of Bavaria. This most August Train being entred the Church, an Eloquent Sermon was Preached before them, agreeable to the pre∣sent occasion; after which, Te Deum was Sung, and Mass Celebrated by the Bishop of Vienna, with the Harmony of the most ex∣quisite Musick, both Vocal and Instrumental, that Human Art could arrive unto. All which Jubilee and Triumph was much augmented
by the appearance of his Electoral High∣ness, whom the Fatigues and weariness of his Journey could not hinder from bearing part in the Festival of this day; and in∣deed the People beheld him with such Ad∣miration, that their Eyes had scarce time to fix on any other Object than his person, who had atchieved Two such memorable Actions that Year; namely, in passing the Save, and subduing Belgrade, as may com∣pare with the most memorable and Heroick Acts of Alexander, or the Caesars. Whilst these Triumphs were celebrating in Austria, and over all Germany, and Mes∣sengers dispatched to all Courts of Chri∣stendom to carry the happy News of so ma∣ny Victories, the Ottoman Dominions lay disconsolate and low, and exposed to the Incursions of their Enemies, had the Impe∣rialists been inclined to push forward their Victories, even to the Walls of Con∣stantinople. But the Councils of France judging it ne∣cessary to support the Turk, resolved to break into Germany; which was accordingly performed,The French obstructs the War against the Turk. and such a diversion made there∣by, as protracted the War for several Years afterwards: Wherefore thô it be my pur∣pose only to relate the Wars between the Emperor, and the Turks, carried on in the famous Kingdom of Hungary; yet consi∣dering that by the French Machinations and Contrivances a stop was put to the free Course of the Imperial Arms, it may not be from our purpose to make a small digression; and describe the Original of that War, which afterwards involved all Christendom to the great Advantage and Conservation of the Turks. We must therefore understand, that King Lewis the 14th had, on Account of Madam d' Orleans, and a pretended Title arising from her, swallowed in his mind a right to the whole Palatinate; and nourish∣ed for a long time a hatred to that most August Family, watching all Opportunities to seize on those Lands and Cities, which he thought were unjustly detained from him: Howsoever his Enmity burst not into open Violence, so long as the Cardinal of Furstemburg was joyned in a Coadjutorial power with the Elector of Cologne. But that Bishop being dead, and Fu∣stemburg disappointed of his Election by the Choice of Prince Joseph Clement of Ba∣varia; the King passing the bounds of all moderation, breaks with the Emperor, and writes this following Letter to the Pope. Most Holy Father, WE have resolved to Write with our own Hand unto your Holiness, de∣siring you to do justice to Cardinal de Fu∣stemburg, who hath been chosen Archbishop and Elector of Cologne, on the 19th Current of this Month of September, by such plura∣lity of Voices, that this Cardinal doth not doubt, but to obtain the Approbation and Con∣firmation of your Holiness in this Electi∣on, which hath been performed according to the strict Rules of the Cannon; es∣pecially since amongst all those who stood Can∣didates for this sublime Office, none is or can be so capable to govern, and worthy the Dig∣nity of an Archbishop, as this Car∣dinal. What therefore I desire of your Holiness is but a meer Act of Justice: But since we could never as yet obtain the least point of favour from you; we find our selves obli∣ged to lay before your Holiness, that in case your denial of Constituting the Cardinal of Fustemburg Elector by your Bull, should be the Cause and Original of a War, which can∣not be other than bloody and miserable; we protest before God that your Holiness is liable to answer for all those wretched and fatal Accidents which shall trouble and disquiet the repose of Christendom, which you, as the common Father, are obliged to pre∣vent. And lest it should be Objected, That the Bishoprick of Argentina (with which the Cardinal of Furstemburg is invited) is in∣compatible with the Archbishoprick of Cologne; We declare, That the said Cardinal shall readily quit that See; for which we Present one of the most considerable Subjects of our Kingdom, who is the Bishop of Metz, against whom your Holiness can have no Objection, considering that your Holiness once gave him the Character of being the Scourge of the Hereticks. Which being the only Occasion and Sum of this Letter, we crave, Holy Father, the Apostolical Be∣nediction. Given at Versailes September 22. 1688. Subscribed Lewis King of France, the Eldest Son of the Church.
This Letter being delivered to Pope In∣nocent 11th by Cardinal de' Estrees, received not the Answer which the King expected; for this Pope being a person of Courage, just and severe in Observance of the Ca∣nonical Cannons and Constitutions, would not be induced out of fear or dread of those Menaces pronounced in the Letter, to disannul or make void the Lawful Ele∣ction of Prince Joseph Clement of Bavaria, to the Archbishoprick and Electorate of Cologne. Whereupon the King being highly displeased, made a solemn Protest against the Validity of that Election; with which he dispatched Messengers and Curriers with a thousand Menaces into all parts of Germany, as also into Holland; enjoyning them not to intermeddle, or concern themselves in the Electorate of Cologne, declaring that he was resolved to vindicate the cause of the Cardinal of Furstemburg by force of Arms; and at the same time commanded his Troops to march into the Eccleasiastical State near Avignon, and into Germany; upon which Philipsburg was attacked and taken: Some Manifestos, were likewise published at the Diet at Ratisbon, and other places, decla∣ring, That the King did not design to act any thing against the Truce made at Nimeguen, but rather intended to Convert it into a perpetual Peace, in case the Car∣dinal of Fustemburg might be established in the Electorate: Offering also to demo∣lish Philipsburg, and restore it to the Bi∣shoprick of Spire; and Freibourg to the Emperor, it being first demolished. But then as to the pretensions of Madam d' Orleans, relating to her Demands upon the Palati∣nate, the same should be amicably deba∣ted; which not being agreed, in the space of one year, they should then be referred to the impartial Mediation of the King of England,  and the Republick of Venice. But no sooner was this Declaration pub∣lished, than the French by Force of Arms made themselves Masters of several Cities, seizing, and fortifying Castles, miserably burning and destroying the Palatinate;The Cruel∣ty of the French in Germany. and exacting Contributions in Suevia, Franconia, and other places upon pain of military Ex∣ecution, raging over all those Countries with such barbarous Inhumanity, as if men had laid aside all sense of Bowels, or Com∣passion to each other, waging War in a manner unknown to Tartars, Scythians, or other more salvage People of former Ages. This surprizing Irruption of the French into Germany being carried by an Express to his Electoral Highness at Belgrade gave (as we have said) a stop to the progress of his Victorious Arms against the Turk; so that having committed the Command of the Imperial Forces to the auspicious Conduct and Care of General Caprara; he returned with all Expedition to Vienna, command∣ing his own Forces to follow him. At Vienna having passed some few days and diverted himself with his most Serene Consort, at the Imperial Court of his most August Father in Law, he hasted with all expedition to Monaco, the place of his Ele∣ctoral Residence; there to take such Mea∣sures as might secure his Brother in the Electorate of Cologne,The Elector returns to Monaco. to which he had been fairly chosen, and confirmed therein, by the concurrence of Pope Innocent the Eleventh: And likewise guard his own Countries from the Incursions of the French, who now like a Torrent carried all before them, burning and laying all places desolate, even to the very Borders of the Bavarian Do∣minions. Thus were the Ottoman Dominions in Europe rescued from the fatal Blow of an entire Conquest:  For not only were the Bavarian Troops recalled; but the French pressing hard upon the Upper-Germany,The Ger∣man Troops recalled from Hun∣gary. the Emperor was forced to give Licence to the Militia of the Circles to return home, and to remand back from Hungary some of his own Regiments, for security of the Empire, and of the Electors, and other Princes; who now judged it time to unite them∣selves against the common Enemy; which tho' once esteemed to be the Turk only, yet now the French being become more formidable, more cruel, and bloody, than the Turks themselves, when they came first from Scythia, it became the common Interest of all Germany to unite in a Body in oppo∣sition to the dreadful power of their mighty Foe. So the Elector of Saxony joyning with the Princes of Lunenburg, Brunswick, Hanover, and Hesse-cassel, they vigorously made Head, resolving to oppose all the Attempts, which the French made upon the Empire. In this manner the Turks being relieved from imminent destruction, by a stop gi∣ven to the Current of the Christian Arms, they had time to take some breath, and respite, and recover themselves a little, as will appear in the course of the following Year. The Pasha of Belgrade taken Prisoner, as we have said, was carried to Vienna,
where he was treated with Respect, and permitted the liberty of the City,The Pasha of Bel∣grade Pri∣soner. under the care of Cavagre Marc Anto the Empe∣peror's principal Interpreter, because he was a man of Years, a great Soldier, and one chosen for his Valour and Bravery for the defence of Belgrade,  having approved himself on all occasions couragious in Bat∣tel; and particularly in the defence of Belgrade, which he had maintained to the last extremity. The Government of the City of Belgrade being (as we have said) committed to the Care and Command of Mareschal Caprara;Caprara commands at Bel∣grade. His first Employment was to purge and cleanse the City of the noisome and fetu∣lent smell of Dead Corps, which lay scat∣tered in the Streets, under the Walls, and upon the Breaches; the same were laden upon Waggons, to the Number of about Eight thousand, and thrown into the Cur∣rent of the Danube; which being carried down the Stream, found their Graves, or Resting-places, where the Winds and Tor∣rent carried them. The Garrison appointed for Defence of the Town consisted of Four thousand Foot, and a Regiment of Horse, under the Com∣mand of Count Guido de Staremberg; the rest of the Militia being drawn out into Quarters near Peter-Waradin, some care was taken to repair the Breaches by the Art and Industry of the Ingenier Andrea Cornaro; howsoever there was so much neg∣lect in the progress of this work, as tended to the advantage of the Turks, who Two Years afterwards retook the Town again to the disreputation, as well as to the loss of the Christian Arms. But whilst the Ingenier was at work to repair the Breaches,The Works about Bel∣grade neg∣ligently re∣paired. on a sudden a Fire burst forth in the House, or Palace, called the Grand Seignior's Favourite, which con∣sumed it intirely to Ashes, no man know∣ing how, nor by what means those Flames were kindled. After so many happy Successes, Labours, and Travels of the Soldiery, it might now be judged time to put an end to this glo∣rious Campaigne,Caprara seizes on Semandria. and refresh the Soldiery already wearied with Toils and Dangers. But General Caprara willing to make use of the Air of Fortune, resolved to vi∣sit the City of Semandria, which, as he was informed, was abandoned by the Turks: Being come thither, he was carried with a desire to proceed yet farther into the Con∣quered Countries, and advanced as far as Posskarovert, an open Town consisting of about Three hundred Houses, which the Turks also had abandoned, leaving all their Chans, or publick Inns filled with Victuals, and Provisions of all sorts for a Booty to their Enemies. These fortunate Successes induced the Rascians to submit unto the Emperor;The Ras∣cians sub∣mit to the Emperor. so that the Inhabitants of Semandria, having for their Leader Paul Diach, were the first to pay Homage unto his Caesarean Majesty; and in process of time performed great Ser∣vices against the Turk. These being animated by General Ca∣prara increased speedily into a Body of Two thousand men, who surprized a place called VVaolva on the River Drine, and another Town on the same River called Zolkolova, where engaging with a Body of the Turks, they killed a Thousand of them on the place, and put the rest to Flight, of which very few of them had the fortune to escape with their Lives.They take two places and defeat the Turks. But because the Turks made great Spoils and Devastations on the Banks of the River Morava, carry∣ing away many Greeks as well as Rascians into Slavery, General Caprara sent Orders to Heusler to hasten to their help with Five Regiments of Horse, Foot, and Dra∣goons, Heusler being arrived on the River Morava; where hearing of the Exploits which the Rascians had performed, and how that they had taken Three other Ca∣stles upon that River about Twenty Leagues distant from Belgrade; he passed the River and Lodged at Pazziarovitz, an open place, well situated, and easily defended, being guarded in the Front by the Three Ca∣stles, and in the Rear by Semandria. All things meeting the desired Success, Count Caprara returned to Belgrade, from whence he reinforced Heusler with Fifteen hundred Foot to give a stop to the Incur∣sions of the Turks,Caprara returns to Belgrade. who with a Body of Twelve thousand Men ranged all along the River Morava; but consisting for the most part of a sort of Rabble, rather than form∣ed Troops, they were soon dispersed, and came to nothing, Disbanding or Deserting of themselves: Or at least served only for Plunder and Spoil, rather than to oppose or make a Stand against a formidable Ene∣my; and in this manner they made Slaves of their own Christian Subjects, and de∣stroyed their Country, until such time as that some Parties of them moved with in∣dignation for the unjust outrages which the Turks used against them, took up Arms,
and seized the City of Ussiza, a place tho' open, yet rich; killing Five hundred Turks on the place, and taking Two thousand Prisoners. This Town was considered as a very im∣portant Pass and Inlet into Bosnia; but because the Ways were so narrow and rocky, that Cannon could not be drawn thither, it was judged fit not to put a Garrison of Germans into it; but rather to commit it to the Custody and Defence of the Rascians. These ill Successes falling in this manner one on the Neck of another, so dispirited the Turks, that the only way left them to quiet the minds both of the Soldiers and People, was to possess them with the hopes of Peace by the Negotiation of those Am∣bassadors which were lately dispatched from the Sultan to the Emperor, who were now arrived at the Castle of Puffendorf, about Five Leagues distant from Vienna, where they were ordered to remain, until the Ple∣nipotentiaries from Poland and Venice should meet at Vienna, furnished with Commissions and Instructions from their respective Powers in order to a Treaty. And that this pretence might appear more plausible, the Grand Seignior passed to Adrianople; from whence he dispatched very urgent and positive Orders to Yeghen Pasha, that he should forward an Express to the Ambassadors, to press with all ear∣nestness the Conclusion of a Peace, as the sole means remaining to save the Ottoman Empire; which in case he could not effect, he was then to take care that the Frontiers might be defended. Yeghen taking this Message and Com∣mission as an Evidence of the Grand Seig∣nior's Favour, and Re-establishment into his Grace, he readily applied himself to an undertaking,Yeghen Pasha commits great Spoils. which in appearance might look like Obedience to Command; and tho' he knew it was not possible to withstand the Power and Progress of the Imperial Arms, animated with so many Victories; yet considering himself strong enough to do mischief, and spoil, and pillage, he marched from Nissa towards Dobravitz, where he committed all the Outrages ima∣ginable on the miserable Inhabitants of that place; giving liberty to a licentious Sol∣diery to destroy an Ancient Monastery of Greeks, to which many poor Christians be∣ing fled for Sanctuary, they stained the Pavements with the Blood of a thousand persons; carrying away the Old Monks, Women, and Children into distressed Cap∣tivity. Tekeli also being re-inforced with a party of Turks, and Tartars, committed great Spoyls on the Confines of Valachia, and Transilvania; but soon was forced to re∣tire, upon the News that the Rascians with a Body of Four thousand men were march∣ing against them: And thus laying aside much of his confidence in Arms, he resol∣ved to try what effect his persuasions might have with his Transilvanian Friends, and those of his Faction, inviting them to cast off the Yoke of Germany from their Necks, and reassume their Ancient Liberties; and to that end he wrote this following Letter. Ad Capitaneos, Directores, & Magistratus Inclyti Regni Transilvaniae. Omnia bona det Deus Regno Transilvaniae, vigile Ingenium & oculos Incolis ejus opto.

And to leave no Stone unturned, he sollicited the Ottoman Port for new Suc∣cours, promising mighty Successes in case the Tartars would invade Transilvania; the which accordingly was designed, and had taken effect, had not the Cosacks made an unexpected Irruption into Tartary, and thereby obliged those Barbarians to quit their design, that they might attend to the safeguard of their own Country. All places in Bosnia being now subdued, and brought under the power of the Em∣peror (Bertzka only excepted) situate on the Save; Prince Lewis after he had forti∣fied Proot, and Gradisca, marched against it, being a place of such importance as se∣cured all the River from thence to Belgrade: The Turks having advice of the approach
of Prince Lewis, with Terror and terrible Consternation abandoned that vast City, pleasant for its Situation in a delicious Country, abounding with all sorts of Pro∣visions and Fruits, both for the sustenance and delight of the Inhabitants; into this Commodious Dwelling made void by the flight of the Turks, a Garrison of Two thousand Germans was lodged; which ser∣ved them for Winter-Quarters, wherein to refresh themselves after all the fatigues, dan∣gers, and tedious Marches of the passed Campaigne; and to secure this City so plentiful of all sorts of Provisions, a regu∣lar Fortification was Erected on the rising of a Hill, which served to cover, and very much to strengthen the City. Now in re∣gard Advices were brought to Bertzka, that the Pasha of Bosnia was making Le∣vies of men, and recruiting his Forces in the Neighbouring parts;Piccolo∣mini dis∣patched to Vienna. General Piccolo∣mini was dispatched to Vienna, to render an Account of the State of that Country, and to press for Forces immediately to be dispeeded for security thereof; it being a Province inhabited by many Christians, who with encouragement and protection would be ready to submit and do Homage to the Emperor. Piccolomini so well Negotiated his Affairs at Vienna, that he soon procured Orders directed to the General at Belgrade to reinforce Prince Lewis with a consi∣derable Body of men. But because the French were now in motion,P. Lewis recalled to Vienna. and had already entred Ger∣many with a formidable Army; to op∣pose which, there was need of the Coun∣sel and Direction of the best and most Experienced Captains, who had lately with such auspicious Fortune conducted the Imperial Forces against the Turks; it was resolved to recall Prince Lewis of Baden to Vienna;  and to commit the Charge of Bosnia to the Courage and Con∣duct of Piccolomini. So soon as Piccolomini was returned to Gradisca, Prince Lewis took Post for Vienna, having some few days before his departure, taken possession of Oliva, and Sbornich, or Swornich, a City and Castle of considerable importance; of the latter of which, the Charge was com∣mitted to Major Thomas Stracharta, a Scotch Gentleman, who bravely main∣tained it against Two Assaults of the Turks: These places were situate on the River Drine. After which this Valiant Prince departed, leaving most manifest Evidences and Proofs behind him of his Courage assisted with Fortune; for that in the space of about Nine Weeks, he had subdued all the Province of Bosnia, defeated the Pasha with double Numbers, taken Proot, Gradisca, Bertzka, and divers Castles, with no more than Eight thousand Germans, Hungarians, and Croa∣tians. Tho' it was now time to end this Cam∣paigne, yet still the Blocades of Sigeth,  Canisa, and Grand-Waradin were continued; the Defendants, tho' reduced very low, remained howsoever very obstinate and re∣solute to maintain the Garrisons to the last extremity, in hopes rather that their Ambassadors would succeed in the Con∣clusion of a Peace,The Turks desire Peace. than in any apparent probability there was of rescuing them∣selves by their own force, or other ex∣pected Succours. And indeed the Turks might then on very good Grounds have hoped for a peace, since that they rea∣dily offered to have quitted all pretensi∣ons to the Conquered places, and suffer∣ed the Emperor to remain in quiet possessi∣on of all whereof he had made himself Master; which had been a vast advantage to the Empire at that time, when the French were entered into Germany with a formidable Army, burning, laying waste, and destroying all the Palatinate; threat∣ning War on the Empire, which continued for several Years with such fury, that had not King William of England, joyned with Spain, Holland, and some of the Princes of Germany opposed this terrible Foe,The Empe∣ror unhap∣pily refu∣ses it. all the Empire and other Countries had sunk under the weight of the Arms of France. But God knows by what Fate the Emperor refused to hearken to those fair Proposi∣tions of Peace; which that they might not be urged or pressed on his Counsellors, the Turkish Ambassadors were committed Priso∣ners to the Castle of Puffendorf, where they passed some Years under a tedious restraint and loss of Liberty,The Turk∣ish Am∣bassadors in Prison. contrary to the Law of Nations: And tho' the Turks may be much blamed for this kind of Violation of the Law of Nations, and disrespect to the persons of Ambassadors, which in all Countries have been esteemed sacred, yet it is a new thing to be so practised by Christian Princes, especially by the Austrian Family, which is Renowned over all the World for their Piety, Justice, and Cle∣mency. As there was at that time no Reason or Sense for not closing with the
Turks in a Peace, so afterwards the Folly and Misfortune was so apparent, that the Court of Vienna hath often lamented the unhappy Consequences of that evil Coun∣sel, which the Ministers of State to throw off from themselves have cast on the pre∣vailing Faction of the Jesuits, and Clergy, which have ever carried a great sway in that Counsel. And thus having by God's Assistance finished the Wars in Hungary by a full and ample Relation of all that passed in that miserable Country during the Course of the last Year of 1688. Let us now pro∣ceed to the Martial Actions, which passed in the same Year between the Venetians and the Turks.
THE Venetian Successes In Their WAR against the TURKS, In the Year 1688. THE Doge of Venice Dying about the End of the last Year, the Se∣nate knew not any Subject on whom they could more worthily confer that Dignity, than on the Captain-General Francisco Morosini, a Person not on∣ly of an ancient Patritian Family, but one who had signalized himself both in Peace and War, and Sacrificed all his Time and Interest to the Service of the Republick. Had he not merited more than by his great Atchievements in this present War, the Ducal Dignity could not have been bestowed on any more deserving than him∣self, of which the Senate was so sensible; that tho' it was a new thing to Elect a Doge who was absent,F. Moro∣sini Elect∣ed Doge. which some, envious of his Vertues, and growing Greatness, did ob∣ject; yet the Majority of Voices carried the Election, and accordingly the Ducal Bonnet was, by order, sent to Morosini, by the Secretary Zuccato, who found his Se∣renity aboard the Admiral Gally in Porto Poro, a Port in the Morea; where he offer'd in the Name of the Senate, expressed in a most Eloquent Oration, the Ensigns of the Principality; all the other Ceremonies be∣ing solemnly perform'd at Venice. Before this Happy Inauguration, the Pe∣stilence had greatly infested the Venetian Armata; but by God's Blessing, it was now ceased, and Prattick given at Venice to those who came from thence; for which the Doge having returned Thanks in a devout man∣ner to Almighty God, aboard the Fleet, he began to entertain thoughts of undertaking some Enterprize worthy his new Dignity, and which might serve for a Fortunate O∣men of what was to succeed in all the Pro∣gress of his Auspicious Government, which at the beginning looked fair, and prospe∣rous in all the Circumstances thereof. For from Candia Advices were brought to the Armata, of great Revolutions, and Mutinies in Candia, which ended with the Death and Destruction of that Vizier, and the principal Pasha's and Bey's of that place:Troubles a∣mongst the Turks in Candia. In Canea the Disorders were not less, the Souldiery following the Example of those Seditions, and Tragedies acted at Constan∣tinople, would govern themselves; and whilst they knew not what Government to set up, there was a Rumour amongst them amidst their Confusion, That they would deliver up those Places into the Hands of the Venetians; but their Army being at some distance, and not near enough to meet the heat of this Popular Insurrection, these Hopes vanished, the Turks returning to more sober, and cooler Counsels. The Captain Pasha was now ready to come forth with the Ottoman Fleet, which consisted of so few Gallies, as were in no condition to deal with the Naval Forces of the Venetians,The Tur∣kish Fle t very weak. and yet were of some use for Transporting Soldiers and Relief to Negro∣pont, or other Parts, according to the Mo∣tion of the Enemy. But the Venetian Armata increased daily by the Union of several Convoys dis-speeded to joyn with the main Body under Com∣mand of the Doge. The first Convoy was composed of seve∣ral Ships, Marsilians, and light Gallies, un∣der the Command of his Excellency Pisani, with whom also two Noble Venetians called Lorenzo Donato, and Girolamo Grimani, were Embarked,The Vene∣tian A ma∣ta joyned. appointed by the Senate to assist as Counsellors unto his Serene Highness the Doge; whom four other Noble Venetians accompanied to supply Places, and Offices of Trust, as occasions should offer. On another Convoy the first Regiment of Wirtemberg, and the Prince himself, who Commanded them, was Embarked with se∣veral Nobles, and Gentlemen of that Nati∣on, all of them Brave and Experienced Sol∣diers, attended with many Ships, and Ves∣sels
laden with Ammunition, Provisions, and all sorts of Instruments and Utensils for War. And with them also were dispatched the Syndicks and Officers for better go∣vernment of the Morea. A third Convoy was also prepared, and dispatched with the Second Regiment of Wirtemberg, under the Command and Con∣duct of the Prince Landgrave of Armstadt, and whilst these Forces were on their Voy∣age towards Porto Poro, there to joyn with the main Body of the Venetian Fleet, in or∣der to some great Enterprize, his Excel∣lency Cornaro Proveditor-General in Dalma∣tia,Cornaro in Dalma∣tia. was giving all the Assistance he was a∣ble, to the Christians of that Country; who upon the Rumour of the Misfortunes of the Turks, had taken Arms to recover their Freedom. The Commander in Chief of the Turks in those Countries, was called Solyman Pa∣sha, who by ill Successes having lately been droven into the Castle of Podgorizza, which he had plentifully provided with all sorts of Provisions and Ammunition, he gathered unto him all the Soldiers that were in Scu∣tari,Solyman Pasha troubles the Christians Antivari, Dolcigno, Alessio, Drino, Croia, Durazzo, Ofrida, and Terra Nova; with which, and with the Auxiliaries of 4000 Turks joyned thereunto by Verlaz Pasha Sangiack of Valona, he had formed an Army of 10000 Fighting Men, with which he resolved according to Commands recei∣ved from the Port, to destroy the Cutzi, Montegrini, and Nixichi, Inhabitants of the Mountains, who having cast off the Maho∣metan Yoak, had devoted themselves to the Venetian Republick. At the first beginning Solyman Pasha sent kind Messages to them, Exhorting, and In∣viting them to return to their former Obe∣dience; but they trusting to their strong Holds in the Mountains, and to the Assuran∣ces given by the Proveditor-General Corna∣ro, to relieve and succour them on all Occa∣sions, they rejected all the fair Words and Propositions made to them by the Turks. Whereupon Solyman Pasha Detached about 3000 Men under the Command of Ahmethis Kaja, or Deputy, to fall upon their Rear in the Mountains;His Kaja beaten by the Cutzi. but the Cutzi so bravely received their Attack, and with such Con∣stancy, that after a Bloody Fight, which continued for several Hours, the Kaja was totally Routed, and Defeated, and forced to betake himself to a shameful Flight: Whilst on the other side Solyman Pasha Burn∣ed some Villages, and cut up the Vines, and ruined the Vineyards of the Cutzi; who thereupon were so highly Enraged, that pursuing their late Victory with Cou∣rage and Indignation, they fell upon the Pasha, and forced him to take Refuge in his Castle of Podgorizza. The News hereof being brought to the Proveditor-General, he dis-speeded Orders to the Cavalier John Antonio Polizza, that with the Borderers on the Channel of Cattaro, and to the Super-Intendent Perini, that with a Battalion of Italians, and 600 of those called Oltramarini, who are Albaneses, and other People living on the Coasts of Friuli and Dalmatia;Succours sent to the Cutzi. they should march to the Succour and Assistance of the Cutzi: And in the mean time to give the Turks an Alarm in divers Places, some Gallies and Galeas∣ses were commanded to pass along the Coast of Albania, under the Conduct of that No∣ble Venetian called Francisco Grimani, Ne∣phew to Cornaro: This Appearance on the Coast, sometimes at St. John de Medua, then again near Dolcigno, and soon after∣wards on the Shoar of Boiaria, and Anti∣vari, the Turks were so confounded thereby, that they knew not where to apply them∣selves; until at length some Venetians Land∣ing near Antivari, were Attacked by one Ahmet Aga, the Son of the Governour of that place, whom they repulsed with much Vigour, and killed Ahmet upon the Place; and stranded a Brigantine belonging to Ca∣stel Nuovo on the Shoar. But the grand Design and Enterprize of this Year, being the Siege of Negropont, the whole Venetian Fleet with the Gallies of the Pope, and Malta, having made their gene∣ral Rendezvous in Porto Poro, on the 19th of June, Old Stile, weighed Anchor, dire∣cting their Course towards the Archipelago. The Fleet was divided into three Squadrons; one Commanded by his Excellency Veniero,Part of the Venetian Fleet snt to the Dar∣danelli. Captain Extraordinary of the Ships; ano∣ther Squadron consisted of Gallies, under Command of the Governour of the Condan∣nata, or of such who are Condemned to the Oar, whose Post was to keep to Wind∣ward of the Fleet. The third Squadron was Commanded by the Doge himself, who with the remaining part of the Galleasses, Gallies, Galleots and Ships, were to take their Station to Lee-ward; besides which, a Squadron of Ships with 13 Christian Cor∣sairs, making in all 26 Sail, were dispatched before with Orders to advance as far as the Dardanelli, and give a stop to the Captain Pasha; who upon the News of this power∣ful Fleet, durst not adventure Abroad, but kept within the Reach and Covert of the Castles: For indeed the Turkish Fleet, which for many Years past had not been of equal force to engage the Venetians,They stop the Captain Pasha from coming out. was this Year also much weakened by the want of Eight Gallies, which the Captain Pasha had dispatched to the Black Sea for relief of their Saicks against the Cossacks, who much
infested that Coast, and for want of forty Galleots, which were remaining on the Stocks in the Arsenal at Constantinople, ha∣ving neither Slaves for the Oar, nor Soldi∣ers for Fight and Defence, nor Seamen to Sail and direct them. Nor was the Captain Pasha of sufficient force to give Convoy to the Fleet expected from Egypt, consisting of nine great Soltanaes, and diverse Saicks la∣den with Ammunition and Provisions, of which, tho' the Grand Seignior had great want, and had dispatched divers Com∣mands unto Alexandria, to hasten their Voyage; yet the fear they had of being intercepted by the Venetians, was a suffici∣ent Defence for them against the reiterated Commands of the Port. This Squadron of Ships coming to An∣chor before the Mouth of the Dardanelli, kept the Turkish Fleet within the Castles, whilst the Doge advanced with the main Fleet towards the Island of Negropont, in the Form and Manner before described. The Island of Negropont is the most con∣siderable of all the Isles in the Archipelago; the ancient Name of it amongst the Greeks and Latines was Eubaea;The De∣scription of the City of Negro∣pont. it had also other Names, as Macris from the narrowness of the Channel which passes between the Island, and the Main Land; Abantias and the Peo∣ple Abantiades; the chief Town was Chalcis, now named after the Denomination of the Country; Pliny calls the Island Aso∣pis, and Strabo Ocha; it had also the Name of Ellopia, from Ellope the Son of Jupiter. This Island, as believed, was once joined to the Main Land, but separated from thence by some Earthquake, and now adjoyned by a Bridge; it is 365 Italian Miles in com∣pass, 90 Miles in length, and 40 in breadth. The City of Negropont anciently Chalcis, is situated on the Euripus, which is a narrow Channel, that in a wonderful manner Ebbs and Flows seven times in 24 Hours: The Walls of the City are about two Miles in compass, but the Suburbs are much larger, and more Populous, by reason of the many Greeks and Jews which Inhabit therein. The Captain Pasha is the Chief Commander thereof; but commonly governs by his Deputy: There is a Bey also belonging to it, a Man of great Power, by reason that he draws from thence a Yearly Revenue for Maintenance of a Gally. Negro∣pont when taken by the Turks.This Island of Negropont formerly be∣longed to the Venetians, and to this Day the Arms of St. Mark remain over one of the Gates of the City; when Pietro Zani was Doge, it was given by the Emperour of Constantinople to the Venetians in recom∣pence and reward of some good Services performed by that Republick towards him; or rather because he could not defend it, he gave it over into the Hands of a good Ally. But in the Year 1469, Sultan Mahomet being desirous to joyn that Pleasant Isle to his other Conquests, endeavoured to make a Bridge for the more easie Transportation of his Troops into the Land; but being re∣pulsed by the Inhabitants, and the Bridge overthrown, the Turks were forced to betake themselves unto their Boats, and Vessels: Howsoever in less than a Month afterwards, the Turks returned before the Place with 300 Sail, and then having formed the Bridge, as was intended, Mahomet himself came with an Army of 120000 Men, and Attacked the City, which was Fortified after the manner of those Times, and defended by a Garri∣son of 24000 Men, under the Command of Giovanni Bondulmiero, Ludovico Calvo, and Paolo Erizzo. The Turks raised several Batteries in diffe∣rent Places against it, by which they made such large Breaches, that they made four terrible Assaults thereon, in which above 40000 Turks were Slain, and the Enemies bravely repulsed, but at length being over∣whelmed with Numbers, and tired with a long Siege, the Guards which defended the Porta Bureliana, conveyed themselves se∣cretly away, and abandoning their Post, they entered the Gate without much opposition, killing all the People who passed the Age of 20 Years. Calvo was killed on the Place, and Bondulmiero in his House: Erizzo having Intrenched himself in some fast place, de∣fended himself Valiantly, and at length sur∣rendred on Conditions of Life; but the Turks maintained them not, but caused him to be Sawn in two: His Fair Daughter chose rather to die by her own Dagger, than to give up her Chastity to the Lust of the Turks. The Turks having remained Masters of this City ever since the Year 1469; it came at length to be Attacked in hopes of Reco∣very in this Year 1688;Preparati∣ons in order to the Siege of Negro∣pont. in order unto which, the Captain Extraordinary Veniero, was appointed with nine Ships belonging to the Republick, a Fire-ship, and a Palandra to guard the Channel of Negropont, and to hinder the Turks from bringing Succours to the City; to which also seven Gallies were added under Proveditor Pisani. At the same time also, several light Gallies were ordered to scower the Channel of Volo, and hinder all Succours from passing on that side. All the Land Forces being Embarked up∣on the Ships, Gallies, Galleasses, Galleots, Palandras, and other Vessels; the Venetian Fleet weighed Anchor on the 7th of July from Porto Poro,The Ve∣netian Fleet Sails towards Negro∣pont. and Sailed with a fair Wind, directing their Course towards the Island of Negropont; but by what Misfor∣tune
not known, a great Ship called the Smyrna Merchant, ran upon a Rock, which being high,July. and easily seen, it was suspect∣ed, to have been done on purpose by Trea∣chery of the Captain; the which unhappy Accident gave some stop to the proceeding of the Fleet, in hopes to save most of the Rigging, and Materials thereunto belong∣ing: But in fine a Gale of Wind springing up, the Ship was broken in pieces, and no more saved than only the Men and eight Pieces of Cannon of the 50 with which she was mounted, besides some Bombs, and o∣ther Materials for War. This Accident hin∣dered something of the Proceedings of the Fleet, which received yet a greater Impedi∣ment from the Northern Winds, which at this Season of the Year so constantly reign in those Seas, as if they were Trade-Winds: Howsoever when the Gale abated, as it doth commonly towards Night, the Gallies made use of their Oars to row to Windward as high as Cape Colonna, where afterwards the Ships joyned them: And ta∣king the Calm of the Night, the Gallies by force of their Oars towed up the Ships, and on the 11th of July they entered the Channel of Negropont; and on the 13th came to an Anchor in the Road, called the Gardens, about six Miles distant from the Capital City of Negropont. Here it was that all the Soldiers, Horse and Foot which were Embark'd on the Galleasses, Gallies, and Galleots, making a Body of a∣bout 8000 Foot, and 500 Horse, Landed without the least opposition;Some of the Forces land∣ed on Ne∣gropont. having only seen a Party of about 50 Turks on Horse∣back who presented themselves in view, to take cognizance of the Motion of their E∣nemies, amongst which Mustapha Pasha Commander of the Town was there in Per∣son. So soon as the Out-guards of the Turks posted on a Tower erected on a Neck of Land which stretched out to the Euripus, espy'd the Troops which were disembark∣ing, they discharged some Guns, to give an Alarm to the Town, and immediately quit∣ted the place, as being not tenible; into which some Soldiers were entered from the Ducal Gally, being an advantageous Post, wherein were found four Iron Guns, and some small Provisions. The Day that these Forces were Landed, some Greeks of the Country, together with the Captain of a French Tartana came, and gave Intelligence,Turkish Strength in Negro∣pont. that the whole force of the Island consisted of about 6000 Men, with Janizaries and Spahees; but that they did not trust much to the Faith of the Inha∣bitants, whom they had lately disoblig'd by taking from them the best of their Goods and Furniture for their Houses: That the Walls of the City were lined with Earth, and fortified on all sides with Bastions, well provided with Cannon: That all the Gates, and Entrances to the City were Mined; and that the Suburbs were surrounded with a deep Ditch and Pallisadoes: Besides which, that there were some Out-works lately fi∣nished, all provided well with Water, and Provisions necessary for a long Defence. That there were two Governours in chief, one called Mustapha Pasha, a Man of great Reputation, who Commanded the Mount, on which a Battery was erected towards the Sea: The other was Ibrahim Pasha, who de∣fended the Outworks of the City, both Men of Resolution; besides these, who defend∣ed the Town, in which the Garrison was very strong, the Seraskier lay Encamped with 4000 Men, most Horse, not far from Negropont. On the 14th of this Month his Serenity the Doge,The Doge, and Gene∣ral Officers, take a view of the Country. accompanied with General Ko∣nismark, and the Engenier Verneda, attend∣ed with many Barges and Felucaes, went to take a Survey of the Country, of the Situ∣ation of the City, and the Forts, and Bat∣teries, which tho' more in number, and furnished with Cannon beyond expectation, did not yet abate the Courage of these As∣sailants. All things being well observed by these Generals, they discovered how the Turks had on the left Hand of the Bridge rai∣sed a Battery with Earth, and planted many Pieces of Cannon thereon, and pitched their Tents along the side of the Aqueducts: And on the left Hand had formed a Line of Communication between the Suburbs and the Hill which commands the Sea, from whence they could offend the Gallies with their Shot, and the Venetian Tents; besides which, they discovered divers other Tren∣ches in different Forms, strengthned with Pallisadoes, with a deep Ditch full of Sea-Water, 30 Paces long, reaching to the Gate of the City, covered by a Hornwork: And below the Mills another Battery was raised of three Pieces of great Cannon, which commanded the Shoar along the Sea-side; all which Forts were defended by some Christians more or less in every Work, most of them of the French Nation, who were skilful in throwing Bombs, and all sorts of Fireworks. Thus the Doge, and his Generals, having taken a full Survey of the several Fortifica∣tions of the City, and the Situation of the Country, on the 15th of the Month, was the Day appointed for the March of the Army towards a rising Hill opposite to ano∣ther which covers the City:The Chri∣stian Troops advance. And at the same time the Gallies, and Galleasses ad∣vanced by force of their Oars, against the Northern Winds, which continually blow at that Season, and came to an Anchor un∣der
that rising Hill, which is near to a Wood, from whence they could see the new Fort of Karababa, or Black Father. An in regard the Ships could not enter into the Channel of Negropont, by reason of contra∣ry Winds, the Doge dispatched away the Captain of the Gulf, with 10 Gallies to take out the Soldiers, and Transport them a∣shoar to joyn with the rest of the Army: And for more expedition in this Work, the Proveditor Pisani, who Commanded the Gallies which are Manned with such as are Condemned to the Oar, being returned with the nine Ships, of which we have given an Account, to have been ordered to the Dar∣danelli; and by reason of contrary Winds, were put into the Port of Andro, was also commanded to give his Assistance, for land∣ing Soldiers, Horse, and all the Instruments, and Necessaries for War. Whilst these things were preparing for the Siege,The Gene∣ral of Mal∣ta receives Audience of the Doge. the Baly Spinelli, a Neapolitan Cavalier, General of the Gallies of Malta, demanded Audience of the Doge, to pass his Complement of Congratulation upon his Advancement to the Ducal Throne, the which being granted, the General appeared with a great Attendance, followed by many Boats, Barges, and Felucaes; so soon as he was ascended into the Ducal Gally, which was adorned with Flags and Streamers from Stem to Stern, he was saluted with four great Guns, and at the Stairs was met and conducted by Lieutenant General Pisani, to the Stern of the Gally, where his Serenity was seated on his Throne, having on his Head his Ducal Bonnet, and wearing the Senatorian Gown after the ancient Roman Fashion; before him stood the four Admirals of the Seas. The General of Malta being entered into the Presence, the Doge arose from his Throne, and received him standing. The General with eight other Knights, Captains of the Gallies, and his Comrades, made a most profound Reverence at their Entrance, and having delivered the Letter to the Doge, from the Grand Master of Malta, full of kind and amicable Expressions, all there pre∣sent stood Bare-headed whilst it was reading: After which the General was caused to sit down on a Seat placed on the right Hand of the Doge, and four of the Knights on a Bench on the left Hand, the other four re∣maining without, seated also on Banks, the Antiport of the Cabin being drawn up, the Slaves at the Oar were cloathed in White, and the Soldiers clad with divers Colours, armed with Half-Pikes, Muskets, and Swords, each bearing a Burgurdian on his Head, which being to the Number of 500 Men, appeared very pleasant to the Eye. This Complement was no sooner passed, than News was brought, That a Skirmish had happened between the Voluntier Ad∣venturers and the Turks;A Skirmish between the Turks and Venetians but the first being reinforced by the Marquis Corboni, with some of his Dragoons, and Soldiers of the Greek Nation, the Fight became very warm, but the Turks were at length forced to retire with considerable Loss; tho' this Success cost the Life of Colonel Paul Macri, being shot in the Head, who for his Bravery and Deserts having obtained the Honour of Knighthood, was much deplored and la∣mented by the whole Army. By this time the Ships under Veniero, and the main Body of the whole Armata were come about, and had doubled the Point of Karababa, from whence they received many Shot, but without any damage; so that the Ships and Gallies having taken the several Posts assigned to them, and also four of the Duke of Tuscany's Ships laden with Warlike Provisions, and 400 Land Soldiers, being come and joyned to those other Forces be∣longing to the Great Duke's Gallies, com∣posed a Body of 800 Men; all which being arrived and united to the Fleet and Army, the Doge prepared every thing ready in or∣der to a formal Siege. The General of the Great Duke's Forces was Named Chigi, who having made a Visit to his Serene Highness the Doge, the same Ceremonies passed, as were shown towards the General of Malta. Eighteen Days after the Forces were Landed, all the Approaches were finished in fight of the Town; during which Time the Turks made not the least Sally to hinder, or disturb the Works, nor did the Venetians fire a Gun against the Turks, who greatly wondered at so long silence, as if on both sides a Cessation of Arms had been agreed; and all remained quiet,The Town Invested. until the 30th of July, when the Cannon began incessantly to play about Break of Day in the Morning from the Venetian Batteries, with Showers of Bombs and Carcasses, which being thrown into the Town and Outwarks of the Enemy, filled the City with Terrour and Consterna∣tion, especially the Women, whose Cries and Schreeks were heard into the Venetian Camp. The first of August a Resolution was ta∣ken to Attack a certain Fort called Loppo,August. si∣tuate on a little Hill, but upon discovery that the place was Undermined, the Design was altered, and Orders given to Bomb the Place with a Palandra, a Vessel made for that purpose, which ruined some of the Turks Trenches; howsoever this Attempt cost the Life of two Mariners, and the Loss of the Captain's Arm, who commanded the Palandra.
After which the Venetians advanced under the Mills securing their Posts with Earth and Baskets; and the Malteses and Floren∣tines endamaged the Enemy very much, by the Bombs and Carcasses which they threw into a small Fort on the East-side, and there∣by it was, as it were, totally destroyed and levelled. And as the Venetians were diligent in their Approaches, so the Turks were not less active to give them a Repulse, and to make frequent Sallies as they did one upon the Malteses, of whom they kill'd and wounded about 40, and afterwards retreat∣ed, but not without some loss both of Men and Horse. In the mean time the Cannons play'd continually from the Batteries, and Bombs thrown into the Town, one of which falling into the House of the Pasha, so af∣frighted the Women and Children, that with Schreeks and Cries casting themselves at the Feet of the Pasha, begged and beseech∣ed him to surrender up the Town into the Hands of the Enemy upon Terms of Capi∣tulation; but the Pasha inflexible, and refu∣sing to hearken unto such Intreaties, resol∣ved to maintain it to the last Extremity: To which End many Retrenchments were made within the Walls, and Caverns digged under Ground, to secure the People, and Goods, and Soldiers which were not on the Guard, from the Desolation made by the Bombs. During all this time the Seraskier, with a Body of about 4000 Men, remained at a Place called Petra in Livadia,The Sera∣skier at Petra. about six Miles distant from Negropont, with design not to adventure his Men, until some unavoidable Necessity happened, or the City was reduced to its last Agony; which as yet was not so far streightned, but that there remained some hopes that it would be able to relieve it self; it being esteemed better Service to keep the Passes free, and an open Commerce with the Town, than to hazard an Engagement with the Enemy, with so unequal a Force, which being overthrown, would prove a certain forerunner of the Loss of the City. The Venetians finding it more easie to pro∣ceed on the Attack of the Town, than to lose time in taking the Fort of Carababa, they raised a new Battery upon a small Rock, at the Entrance of the Port under Command of the Captain of the Gulf, which he effected with his own, and the help of another Galley.The Vene∣tian Camp wasted with Sickness. But what most incommo∣ded the Venetian Camp, was the excessive Heats; for tho' the Winds were Northerly, as they commonly are in those Seas; yet passing over the Land, they contracted such Heat, and carried with them such a kind of Noxious, and Sulphureous Vapour, as pro∣duced Malignant Fevers amongst the Soldi∣ers, and Officers, that many of them Died, and the Camp became enfeebled, and much weakened; amongst which was General Ko∣nismark; who being forced to leave the Camp, to go Aboard his Ship in order to his Cure, his Command was committed to the Charge of Major General Horn of Bruns∣wick. The Sickness still spreading with Fe∣vers and Tertian Agues, a Sergeant Gene∣ral of Battallia, Pietro Gaspari, and Colonel of the Switzers, died thereof; and the Count Palatine Landgrave of Hesse, redu∣ced to the last Extremity; so that many Designs were neglected, which might have gained the City, and all the Enterprises of the Army became faint and languishing. Be∣sides Health there was nothing that wanted; the Island it self being very fruitful,Negro∣pont a Fruitful Country. abound∣ed with Wines, and all sorts of Victuals, and Provisions for the Sustenance of Hu∣mane Life, and were it not for the Depreda∣tions made thereon by Pirates, it would be one of the most happy Countries of the World: The Inhabitants thereof being of an Open, Free, and Chearful Nature,The Temper of the In∣habitants. of a Sanguine Complexion, and Merry like the other Greeks, without much Thought, or Care, which renders commonly the Lives of Men very uneasie to themselves and o∣thers; and tho' the Country abounded with all things, yet the Neighbouring Islands brought over their Cattle and Fruits thither; which finding a ready Market, caused as great Plenty, and abundance of all things, as could be desired. On the 10th of August the Turks made a Sally into the Venetian Trenches, whence happened a Skirmish, but without much da∣mage, or hurt on either side; nor had the Enemies Cannon done any great Execution as yet on the Christian Camp; which, on the 11th of August had perfected all their Batteries. And to spare the Labour of the Soldiers, who had already suffered much in opening Trenches, and raising Batteries, and Fighting; Orders were given to Seig∣nior Delfino Proveditor of the Camp, to gather what Greeks he could to serve for Pio∣neers, and that every Gally, and Galleass should prepare 500 Faggots, with some Pal∣lisadoes, which was readily effected. And now about the 13th of this Month,The Turks show them∣selves. the Enemy began to show themselves Even∣ing and Morning near the Venetian Tren∣ches, but attempted nothing, with design as was imagined, to draw their Enemies into a place which they had Undermined; so that for three or four Days nothing happened of any thing considerable, unless it were the bursting of a Cannon, which battered the Pallisadoes of the Enemy, by which the chief Gunner was killed, and five others were wounded; and another Cannon dis∣mounted by a Shot from the Enemy upon the Wheel of the Carriage.
But on the 16th about Sun-set, the Turks Attacked the Trenches of the Malteses, where a very hot Skirmish began,The Turks Attack the Malteses. which continued for the space of an Hour, until Night coming on, the Turks retired with considerable Loss, and of the Malteses a∣bout 15 were killed, and about 20 wound∣ed: Upon which the Malteses advanced and enlarged their Works, and whilst they were Fighting on that side, a Detachment of 3000 Men Attacked a Fort near the Mills about a Pistol-shot from the Enemies Pallisadoes, of which after some resistance, they rendered themselves Masters with the Death of above 100 Turks,A Fort near the Mills taken. and some wounded. The loss of this place being of great im∣portance to the Turks, by Break of Day in the Morning on the 17th, they fell upon it with grat Numbers to recover it, and sur∣prized the Florentines and the Regiment of Atti, which were the Guard placed there to defend it; which being Sleeping, or found in a negligent Posture,The Turks recover it. the Turks returned with 150 Heads, amongst which were seve∣ral Cavaliers of Florence, and three Captains of the Regiment, and the rest quitted the Fort and fled, amongst which were above 100 wounded; which Action cost the Turks very little. The Doge being highly enraged at this ill Success, and desirous of Revenge, re∣solved to Attack the Enemies Trenches; which tho' esteemed by a Counsel of War,The Doge resolves to Attack the Turks in their Tren∣ches. to be a hazardous Enterprize, which tho' it should succeed, would cost much Blood; yet the Doge nothing moved, continued his Re∣solution to put the Attempt in execution on the 20th of August, being well assured, that nothing could be effected on the Town un∣less first they could possess, and make them∣selves Masters of the Enemies Trenches. In order unto which on the 17th the Doge, with the chief Sea-Officers, came ashoar to take a View, and Survey the Enemies Tren∣ches, the which extended almost three Miles from the Hill to the Sea, the Soldiers there∣in lodged securely, as if they had been Bu∣ried;The Manner of their Trenches. they were very spacious and deep, so that 50 could march a Breast, secured by vast Oaken Beams, over which were Sacks of Cotton artificially laid, and the void pla∣ces filled up with Earth; and what damage was done hereunto by the Venetian Cannon, or Bombs in the Day, were by the Indu∣stry and Labour of the Turks repaired in the Night. These Trenches were likewise de∣fended by five Batteries, on which 26 Pie∣ces of Cannon were mounted, and six Mor∣tar-pieces which threw Stones at such di∣stance, as served not only to defend their own Trenches, but also to offend the Vene∣tian Camp. Whilst the Doge, and principal Officers were contriving the Attack which was to be executed on the 20th: The Turks on the 18th made a Sally on the Regiment of Co∣lonel Gaspar an Athenian,August The Turks Sally on. who was placed to guard the Aqueducts, but were so brave∣ly received by the Valour of that Colonel, that they were repulsed with the loss of 150 of their Men killed on the place;Colonel Ga∣spar an Athenian killed. and 50 or 60 of the Christians, amongst which was Colonel Gaspar himself, being shot in the Breast with a Musket-Bullet; in recompence of whose Resolute and Valiant Behaviour to the general Satisfaction and Applause of the whole Army, the Doge bestowed the Command of the Regiment on his Brother Demetrio, with an Annual Pension to his Son, during his Life. The Morning of the 20th being come every one prepared himself for the intend∣ed Assault on the Enemies Trenches. The Marquis of Corbon with his Cavalry, was the first to break in upon the Enemies Horse,The Turks Attacked in their Tren∣ches. which he performed with such Success, that he thereby opened a way for the Foot to Attack the Trenches in three several places, which was executed with such resolution, that neither Cannon nor Musket-shot were serviceable on this occasion; for the Fight in the Trenches was so close with the Swords and Handy Blows; that being in∣termixed one with the other, the Comba∣tants rather appeared like Gladiators than Soldiers fighting in regular Troops. The Turks on one side being hard pressed, began to throw away their Arms and fly; but being seconded, and relieved by some Troops led on by the Pasha Commander of the place, who at the same time promised Rewards to the Valiant, and threatned Death to the Cow∣ardly, the Fight increased, and the Tren∣ches were filled with the Bodies of Dead and dying Men. The Venetians were repulsed twice, and thrice in some places: But at length all the Passes towards the Mountain being forced by the Regiment of Bonometti, and the Venturieri, (who are Soldiers of Fortune) the Turks began to abandon their Posts, and betake themselves to Flight;They quit them and fly. and other Regiments forcing the Lines in other places, filled all with Slaughter and Confusi∣on; the Horse were the first began to turn their Backs, running with full Career to take refuge in the Town, and to save themselves: But the Infantry fared much worse, for some Thousands of them being pursued by the Christians, even to the Gates of the City, about 500 of them were cut off, and their Journey shortned. Another Party of the Turks flying to∣wards the Sea, were killed by the Horse, and others threw themselves headlong into the Water, where some were Drowned,A terrible Slaughter. and others killed by Vollies of Musket-shot
from the Shoar, so that the Sea was dyed with Blood, and covered with the Garments and Bodies of Men; and besides those who were killed and wounded of the Turks, ma∣ny Prisoners were taken. This Fight con∣tinued about two Hours, at the beginning of which, the Turks Cannon offended much the Venetian Troops, but without any dis∣order, every one giving undoubted Proofs of his Bravery, and constancy of his Reso∣lution. This Action cost the Lives of 200 Men, amongst which Seignior Girolamo Gar∣zoni was slain,Girolamo Garzoni slain. the Senior of all the Senators then in the Camp; he at first was hurt with a Musket-shot in the Side, but refusing to yield unto that Wound, or to be carried in∣to the Tent for Cure, he continued to fight, until he was cut down by a Turkish Scimeter, with which the Turk would have taken off, and carried away his Head, but that Seig∣nior Almoro Morosini, covered his Body, and defended it from the Insults and Indignities of the Enemy. Of the Venetians about 200 were wounded, amongst which was Prince Harcourt by a Shot on his Breast,The Vene∣tians Ma∣sters of the Turks Trenches & Suburbs. Prince of Turene in the Arm, but the Prince of Wir∣temberg mortally. In the Trenches all their Cannon and Mortar-pieces were taken, with great Numbers of Arms, and all their Bag∣gage and Provisions; after which with little difficulty the Venetians made themselves Ma∣sters of the Suburbs, wherein also they found some Cannon, Provisions and Arms, besides some good plunder. Aug. 21.The Day following this Action, News was brought by a Deserter, That the wound∣ed Men brought into the Town, were above 1000, and those who were killed, were much more, amongst which they reckoned the Son of the Seraskier, and one Mustapha Pasha,The oss of the Turks. who was Bey of five Gallies, with many other Officers: The next Day the Venetians continued to batter the Town with Cannon and Bombs; and the 23d the Turks made a furious Sally, but were re∣pulsed with the loss of 150 Men, and 30 killed on the Venetian side. For three Days afterwards nothing hap∣pened, besides the continual shooting of Cannon and Bombs, until the 27th; when the Christians began to open their Ap∣proaches nearer to the Town, which conti∣nued until the 5th of September, without the least damage imaginable to the Pioneers, or Soldiers; when the Turks to the Num∣ber of 500, made a Sally from the Part of the Suburbs on the Quarters of the Sclavo∣nians,The Turks Sally again. and made themselves Masters of the first Trench; but afterwards rallying again in good order, they drove them out of the Trench, and pursued them to the very Ditch, killing about 40 of them, with the loss only of 14 Christians. General Konismark continuing sick, and his Fever increasing on him, the Doge substituted the Major of the Troops of Brunswick in his place,Genral Konis∣mark sick. to oppose the Sally of the Enemies; and tho' this brave Man was also at that time laid upon his Bed, and labouring under the Access, or Fit of a Fe∣ver; yet he arose, and strove against his Natural Weakness, to comply with the Command of the Doge, but so soon as he was gone out of the Door of his Tent, a Cannon-shot from the Enemy stroke his Bed and overthrew it.Septemb. The Night follow∣ing, Captain Verneda the chief Engineer, and a Captain of the Regiment of Wirtem∣berg, with some common Soldiers, were killed by Musket-shot as they were advan∣cing their Works towards the Ditch. The 6th and 7th passed without other Action than firing Cannon on both sides; by which the Venetians made a Breach in a Tower on the Sea-side at the end of the Ditch;A brave Offer made by an Engi∣neer. upon which the Engenier Romag∣nato, a Man of resolute Courage, made an offer with 50 Persons, how difficult soever the Attempt seemed, to mount the Breach: This generous Offer being accepted, and greatly applauded, the Doge came ashoar in Person, and placed himself in one of the Batteries, to be a Spectator of this Enter∣prize, and to give the necessary Orders therein, which should be required for se∣conding so resolute an Enterprize. On the eighth an Attack was made, and with great courage they mounted the Breach, and planted two Ensigns thereon; but because the Breach was very narrow, without any covert from the Shot of the Enemy, and the descent into the Town very deep and hazardous, they were forced to quit the Post,The Vene∣tians re∣pulsed. which they had gained with the loss of six or eight Men, amongst which was one of the Ensigns, whose Co∣lours howsoever were recovered by another Officer: Nor did the Turks escape without some loss on occasion of the Attack; for 300 Men being lodged in the Ditch to sup∣port those who were to make the first En∣trance, did great execution on the Turks that appeared on the Breach without any covert, or shelter.A remark∣able Pas∣sage. There is one thing very remarkable of a Soldier, who in this Assault received six Wounds on his Head and in his Body with Scimeters, by which falling on the Ruines, was esteemed for Dead, and so remained until the Dusk of the Evening, when rising up, it was not so Dark but that he was perceived by the Enemy, who made many Shot at him; to avoid which, he threw himself into the Sea, bleeding with all his Wounds; and notwithstanding the many Shot aimed at him, of which he recei∣ved one in his Shoulder, he swam away,
and got ashore at the Camp, where he was afterwards cured of his Wounds, which made the Doge to give him the Name of the wonderful Man. The Regiments of Count Waldeck and Colonel Bilz, belonging to the Troops of Wirtemberg, being advanced without any Order for so doing, one to the Bank of the Ditch, and the other to the Foot of the Tower, received an unhappy welcome by several Vollies of small shot,The Veneti∣ans again repulsed. both from the Wall, and from the false Bray; by which two Colonels, seven or eight Cap∣tains, twelve or fourteen Subaltern Offi∣cers, five Cavalier Adventurers, and a∣bout 200 common Soldiers, were all slain upon the place, and as many wounded; which was a discouraging loss to the Be∣siegers, tho' the Defendants, according to the Report of some Deserters, lost double the number within the City. Howsoever, the Venetians being not dismayed hereat, on the 10th of this month forced an Entrance into the Ditch, where they began to form a Gallery for a more near approach unto the Wall, un∣der which they designed once to form a Mine; but because it would be the work of fifteen Days at least before the Mine could be brought to Perfection, for want of good Engeniers, of which many were Dead, and Sick; They raised a new Bat∣tery on the other side of the Water, from whence they made a Breach on the other Tower; and with two pieces of Cannon planted on the Bank of the Ditch, they bartered the foot of the Courtain between the two Towers. The Day following, some Deserters from the Town brought Advice, That the whole Garrison within did not consist of more than 3000 Men, and those much afrighted and discouraged by their many losses; only that which supported their Spirits, was the free and open passage by the Bridge, between the Turkish Camp and the City; by which every third day they received Recruits of Men, and Sup∣ply of Provisions;The Diffi∣culties of taking the City. so that now little hopes remained of taking the City for this year, the Season also being far ad∣vanced: All therefore that remained to be done, was to continue the Batteries and to throw Bombs, of which above 10000 having been already cast into the City, few Houses remained standing, but all reduced to a Mass of Rubbish and Ashes. The Venetians being under these dis∣couraging Circumstances, the Attacks pro∣ceeded but slowly; nothing being heard in the Camp, but of the Death or Sickness of their great Men; amongst which, News was brought to the Doge, that Signior Molino and Delfino were forced to yield unto their sick Beds; That the Engenier Ramagnato was killed with a Musket-shot,The Vene∣tians dis∣couraged. whilst he was giving Direction about the Works in the Ditch; That Signior Aurelio Marcelli was Dead of a Fever caused by his Wounds; as was also Mattio Bon Pa∣tritii, a Nobleman of Venice; And that General Kenismark was Dead of a vio∣lent Fever,General Kenis∣mark's Death. having Breathed his last on the 15th of September, to the great Grief and Sorrow of the whole Army; but especi∣ally of his Lady Carlotta, who with great Affection and Tenderness, having been his Companion in all this Expedition, was over-whelmed with Sorrow and confused Grief at his Death. His Bowels were In∣terr'd the same Night with many thou∣sands of Torches and Lights; but his Body being Embalmed, was afterwards designed for Strade, a place in the Dutchy of Bremen, there to be Interred in the Burial-place of his Ancestors. The same Night two Engeniers were wounded, and one killed, and many common Soldiers killed and wounded by the Enemies shot from the false Bray, whilst they were per∣fecting their Works in the Ditch. And now it being the 17th of September, the Florentines were the first to Demand a Dismission from the Camp,The Gene∣rals of the Great Duke and Malta desire leave to return home. and License to return home, alledging that the Season of the year was far spent, and the long Voy∣age they had to make unto their own Country. The time also appointed by the Great Master of Malta unto his General, for the Fleet to remain abroad, being also expired, Licence was demanded for their return; but the Doge flattering himself with hopes of a speedy Surrender of the place, persuaded that General to stay some few days longer; to which he consented, in expectation of taking part of that Glory which would belong to him by the Con∣quest of that place. But it was not the Will of God that this Place should yield to the Christian Arms, for that from this present time, until the End of the Siege, nothing but Misfortunes attended the Actions of the Venetians. However, The Courage and Constancy of the Generals was such, as that they would not leave one Stone unturned which might tend to the Conquest of the place, resolving not to desist from that Enterprize, whilst any hopes appeared of becoming Masters thereof. In order unto which, the Doge Morosini, considering with the principal Captains, what was farther to be done to facilitate this Enterprize; [it was observed, that the greatest difficulty, was, how to convey their Forces under the Wall, for the Ditch was 30 Paces broad, and washed at each
end by the Sea; to do which, the Inge∣niers found no other means than by a Tra∣verse, which was to be covered on the top, and defended by Gabions filled with Earth, which being considered, and resolved, it was put into immediate Execution, all things necessary for that work being brought to the place, with the Instruments for fixing the Miner to the Walls; but the Waters so encreased in the Night, that the Labour became much more great, and the Design more difficult than was imagi∣ned, they being forced to Work under the Enemies small shot; by which the Enge∣niers,The diff∣culty of di∣recting a Traverse. Samuel Miller was killed, and Re∣naldo Della Ruë, and Antonio Captain of the Miners, grievously wounded. How∣soever, not discouraged from the prose∣cution of this Design, the Marquis of Corbon, Serjeant-General, with some of his Dragoons, undertook that work of the Traverse, which notwithstanding found not the Success expected; he being, whilst he was giving direction about the Traverse, wounded by a Musket-shot, which passed his Left-Thigh. The Turks, who were very vigilant and industrious to destroy the Work of the Traverse; formed a Work in the False Bray, by which they so annoyed the La∣bourers upon the Traverse by continual fi∣ring, that it was not possible to proceed, until the Enemy was droven out of the Counterscarp;The Vene∣tians take a Bonnet from the Turks, and again dro∣ven out of it. to perform which, it was resolved to take a Bonnet which lay in the way, which succeeded according to De∣sire; But the Besieged having considered, that that place was of great Importance, they soon Assaulted it, with such Vigour, that the Venetians not being relieved by the farther advanced Line, were droven out from thence with much Blood and Slaughter. Thus all hopes failing of taking the Town, Camillo Chigi, Admiral of the Gal∣lies of Tuscany,The Gallies of Tusca∣ny depart. having as we have said obtained his Discharge, sailed away with his Squadron of Gallies by Night, that the Turks might not observe his Departure, leaving howsoever behind him two Ships, and some Troops in the Service. The Venetians resolving that the Turks should not remain in quiet Possession of the Bonnet, attacked them again therein, and drove them thence, and fortified it in such manner, that it would be very diffi∣cult for them to regain it. Likewise a new Battery was raised of fifteen pieces of great Cannon,The Bonnet retaken. which shot into the Houses of the Town; and at the same time, a Line of Communication was made for relief of the Bonnet. During which Time and Actions, Dis∣eases increased in the Camp, and Officers, as well as common Soldiers fell sick, by which, and daily slaughters of Men in the Assaults made,Sickness in the Chri∣stian Camp. the Army was much dimi∣nished. And tho' the Condition of the Turks in the Town was rather worse than better, yet their Spirits being supported by the Encouragements given by the Se∣raskier, who promised speedily to relieve them, and to send 2000 Horse into the Morea to make a Diversion, they made several Sallies out of the Town,The Turks Sally. which tho' not with much Advantage to them∣selves, yet it showed a Vigour of Spirit, and that they laboured not under any Fears, or despairing hopes of Defence. On the other side, the Venetians failed not in their Industry, and assiduous Projects every day, in acting some Enterprize or other, which might facilitate a general As∣sault, and give that decisive blow, which should put an end unto, and terminate the Labours of that year:October. But neither the Traverse, nor the Batteries, found the Effect desired and expected; wherefore the Engenier Basignani, who had long laboured under a violent Fever, being now a little recovered, projected a Subterranean Gal∣lery under the Water of the Ditch, to pass unto the Wall; and there underneath to make a Mine, which being sprang could not fail of making such a Breach, as was requisite for an Assault; but in the exe∣cution thereof, there was found too much difficulty, and almost an impossibility; for the bottom of the Ditch was altogether Mud for many yards deep; and in sink∣ing the Shaft to the depth required, they met so much Water as wholly drowned out the Miners and put them by their Work; and Basignani himself,Basignani the Enge∣nier fails in his De∣sign, and is killed. whilst he was gi∣ving Directions, was shot by a Musket-Bullet in the Head, which put an end to this Design, which had it been practicable, would yet have required more time than what the season of the year would admit. The Turks also on the other side had formed a Mine under the Bonnet; which being fired, it had not the due effect, by reason that it was not rightly placed; howsoever the Defendants were so afrighted with the blow, that they abandoned the Fort; as did those of the Battery, not far distant from that place. But what made all things the more de∣sperate, and to look with an ill Aspect, was the Indisposition of his Most Serene Highness the Doge,The Doge sick. being not only forced to keep his Bed, but to use such Reme∣dies as were necessary for his Recovery: Also at the same time, Mateo Querini of Noble Extract, Died, after a sickness of a few days continuance.
And to the farther Weakening and Dis∣abling of the Camp, the General of Malta having obtained his Licence to depart, upon Allegations that he had already transgressed the time which was allotted him by the Grand Master, set Sail in the Night without Ceremony,The Gene∣ral of Mal∣ta departs. or noise of Guns at his departure, which would have animated the Turks to a longer per∣severance in Defence of their Town. Notwithstanding all which, the Batte∣ries continued to play with so good success, that they made such wide Breaches in the Wall, as gave hopes that the Walls might be yet attempted, and made open to an Assault; in which matter, whilst Count Raperta,Chief Of∣ficers kil∣led. who was Serjeant-Major of Bat∣tail, was giving Directions, he was woun∣ded in the Breast by a Musket-shot, which was a great loss and disappointment to the whole Design: In like manner, the Marquis of Corbon, who was a Serjeant-General, was killed by a Cannon-shot from the Battery of Carababa, to the great trouble and loss of the whole Army; there being now much want of good Officers, endued with Bravery and Con∣duct. And tho' all things went thus Ill, yet the Recovery of the Doge, and his Ap∣pearance in the Field, inspired new Cou∣rage into the Hearts of the harassed Sol∣diery: But in regard, the weakness of the Doge was such, as to disable him from taking an exact View of what was acting in the Camp, or what Breaches were made, he was constrained to take all his Informations from the Proveditors of the Camp,Prince of Bruns∣wick, and General Hor com∣mand the Army. who were Commanded to joyn and concurr in all their Resolutions with the Prince of Brunswick, who at present was posted in the principal Command of the whole Army; being assisted with the Counsel and Advice of Serjeant-General Hor, a Soldier of great Esteem for his long Experience in War, tho' much weak∣en'd and faint by a long Sickness. The Doge depending much on the Bravery and Conduct of these Generals, by whom he was assured of the excellent Order and Disposition of all things, resolved to ap∣point the Day for a General Assault: But that an Enterprize of such high Concern∣ment should not be undertaken without mature Advice and Deliberation, a Coun∣cil of War was called, which might dis∣cuss all Points of Difficulty; and consider whether such an Action as this might be practicable under the present Circum∣stances; and the common Safety of the Army, and Glory of the Venetian State, not put to Hazard under doubtful Uncer∣tainties. After some Debates in this Council, a Report was given to his Se∣renity the Doge, That an Attack was very feasible, of W vs an Attack. and might in all probabi∣lity succeed, in case the Breaches were made a little more wide and commodious, and that the Mine were ready to be sprang under that part of the Counter∣scarp which was near the Battery, which would open a passage to the Assailants over the Ditch; for which purpose, thou∣sands of Faggots, and Sacks of Earth were provided, and all things disposed in good order by the Generals, Brunswick and Hor; and Directions given to the Com∣manders of their respective Troops, what Rules and Methods they were to observe in the Attack, and in what manner they were to Succour and Relieve each other. And to inforce and envigorate this At∣tack, the Levents,The Prepa∣rations made for it. or Marine Regiments were taken out of the Galeots; and Re∣formades, and Mariners from the Fleet; and amongst them 200 choice Soldiers be∣longing to the Ducal-Galley, under the Command of Colonel Dissinfeldt, all de∣sperate Fellows, were ready to attempt the most hazardous Enterprize. The day following was appointed for that general Assault, which was to deter∣mine the Fate of that place; when above 8000 Men were posted in their several Stations, and every thing disposed in such manner as was requisite for this great Work; Likewise Alessandro Bon, the Cap∣tain of the Gulf, was Commanded with his Squadron to enter the Port on the Lar-board-side, and Invest the Fort of Ca∣rababa, whereby the Garrison therein might be diverted from sending their Forces for succour of the Town. About Ten a Clock in the Morning the Mine was Sprung under the Counter∣scarp,Octob. 12. An Assault made, which was to be the signal for the Assault; upon which the Troops appointed to storm the Breach began to move, ha∣ving some Granadiers in their Front; and at the same time, Antonio Medini their Commander, scowred the Ditch with a Party of his Men, being followed by 1500 Soldiers, who were to Repulse the Turks, in case of a Salley from the Town; but this unfortunately succeeded; for being come to the Traverse-Line, which was ne∣cessary to be overcome, the Turks so vi∣gorously defended it with Vollies of small shot, that many Captains and Soldiers being there killed, a stop was given to their farther proceeding; for not being sustained by the Troops appointed to se∣cond them,And mis∣carrie. who Halted at the entrance to the Ditch, they were forced to sound a Retreat. From this first Misfortune se∣veral Disorders followed; for whilst a great
Body of Soldiers marched unfiled through a narrow Passage one after another, they were so raked by the Cannon from Carababa, (there being no other Trench opened) that many were killed, and all put into such con∣fusion, that there remained no possibility of entering the place on that side. All this time, those who had mounted the Breach were in great danger, and many lay Dead thereupon, being destroyed by Sacks with Powder, by which they were blown up. Nor was there any better ap∣pearance of Success, or hopes of Entrance on the other side, where, tho' they had mounted to the top of one of the Towers, being conducted by the special Valour of their Commanders, and by the signal Cou∣rage of Bonesana a Major General of the Troops of Milan; from which heighth they discovered such a dismal Descent into the Town, that it was impossible to enter, without throwing themselves Headlong down a Pre∣cipice;Many Men lost. so that no other was the Sequel of this Attempt, but the unhappy and fruitless loss of the Lives of many brave Men. Nor was the 4th Attack more successful than the former three; for on this side the Town was inaccessible; howsoever the Troops marched with their Officers leading them forward,Great mis∣fortunes. and took their Post in the Ditch, without proceeding farther; but this place being neither provided with Bavins, nor Fag∣gots, nor Sacks of Earth, some of the Sol∣diers standing up to the Middle in Water, remained exposed to the Enemies shot, who guarded the Traverse; which being thus su∣stained for several Hours, above 1000 Sol∣diers, with divers Officers, lost their Lives; amongst which were Lieutenant Colonel Slade, and the Captains Pini, Pipam, and Gilinon; and of the Stranger, or Foreign Troops, several were sorely wounded, a∣mongst which were General Spahar, and the Prince of Hermanstadt, who were the Prin∣cipal Officers appointed to direct the Assault. Nor were the Losses on the Sea-side, less than those on the Land. For the Gallies ap∣pointed to make the Diversion, were so dro∣ven by a Storm of Wind into the Current, that it was impossible to save themselves,The Losss sustined by the Gal∣lies. but by coming to an Anchor just under the Town, from whence they received many Cannon-shot. Antonio Nani had his Main-Mast disabled by a Shot of 1000 weight. Gredenigo received the like, which carried away all his Poop, besides other Damages: The Gally of Pizzamano was strook with a Stone-Bullet of three Fathom and a half in Circumference, which had almost sunk the Gally: Alvige Foscari received a Shot of 50 weight in the Midship of the Gally, and another which carried away his Rudder: George Marin had the Poop of his Galley carried away, and he himself wounded in the Throat by the Splinters. Nor did it pass much better with the Captain of the Gulf, by a Shot on the Lar-board side of the Galley, by which he received much dam∣age. In this manner the Gallies drawing off at a farther distance,Octob 1 and the Land Soldiers desisting from their Attacks, all hopes of taking the Town began now to fail; so the Commanders assembling at a Council of War, where every thing was debated,A Counsel of War r∣solves to desist from the Attack. and the impossibility considered of making ano∣ther Assault, in regard to the Fleet, which (as we have said) was much endamaged; and the Camp much diminished by Sickness, Slaughter, and Departure of some of their Troops; and the Season of the Year ad∣vanced to the beginning of Winter, so that it was judged impossible longer to main∣tain the Siege. But because much Blood and Treasure, and the time of a whole Summer had been consumed before that City, a Retreat from which, would look something shame∣ful before the Turks, and make an ill noise, and report over all Christendom;A Proposal made to stay all the Winter in the Island. it was pro∣posed at a Council of War, not wholly to quit, or abandon the place, but to remain before it during the Winter Season; in or∣der unto which it was projected to draw a Line of Circumvallation from one Neck of Land to the other, which was not above the space of an Italian Mile, and the Mould, or Soil being all Earth, it might easily be effected; the which being fortified with a Ditch, and Pallisadoes, Redoubts, and Can∣non, might make a sufficient place of de∣fence for the Soldiers, and convenient Quar∣ters might be made for them out of those Timbers and Planks which they had saved from the Ruines of the Suburbs of Negro∣pont. And that they might be in a conditi∣on all the Winter to endamage the Town, and hinder the Turks from repairing their Breaches, the Mount of Muslekat, and the Hill of Vilibaba, were to be strongly fortifi∣ed with Cannon: In fine all things were proposed, and provided as far as Humane Reason could contrive for security of the Camp, and Maintainance of the Soldiery; and for Provision and Sustenance, they pro∣mised themselves sufficient from the Inhabi∣tants of the Islands, besides those which might be brought from the other Isles of the Archipelago. These Matters being thus proposed, and projected in the Council of War, where En∣quiry was made into the Miscarriages of the late Assault, (which was made appear other∣wise than was represented) it was ordered, that the Cannon which were nearest to the place should be drawn off, and the manner
contrived how it might be executed; and the Night following they began to draw off the covered Cannon,Some Can∣non drawn off. which lay under the Works, the which Attempt was the most difficult of any: To prevent which, the Turks all that Night assaulted the Bonnet with quantities of Granadoes, and Sacks of Powder; but a valorous resistance being made by the Defendants, the Turks were re∣pulsed with great loss; so that the Night following all the remaining Cannon were drawn off and secured: In which Work Silvester the Admiral of Candia, having been very active and adventurous, as he had been in many other doubtful and hazar∣dous Attempts, the Doge honoured him with a Gold Chain and Medal,Octob. 15. as an evi∣dence of his good Services, and of the E∣steem he entertained of his Personal Cou∣rage and Conduct. Had the Project of Quartering all that Winter on the Island succeeded, it was ve∣ry probable, and with good reason it might have been rationally concluded, that the City would have been obliged to yield be∣fore the Spring;The Foreign Troops mu∣tiny, and will not Winter on the Island. but the Foreign Troops being acquainted with the Design, began to mutiny, and loudly to declare, That they would not Winter on the Island, it being one of their Capitulations of Agreement, when they first Enrolled themselves for Soldiers, that they should at the Season when Armies usually break up their Camp, be provided with warm and convenient Quarters, and with the Spring return again into the Field. To force the Soldiers to an Obedience in this particular, was not esteemed adviseable; but to try how far soft Terms and perswa∣sive Arguments might prevail upon them, several Noblemen, and chief Commanders were employed to incline the Wills and Consent of the Soldiery thereunto; but the Plot was deeper laid, for tho' the Com∣monalty only appeared openly therein, yet it was well known, that their Officers had the chief Hand in the Design, and instiga∣ted their Soldiers to act that part which was most desired by themselves. But what was most prevalent with the Council of War, was the Report made by Sergeant General Hor; That the Soldiers in the advanced Lines, were so far set on a Resolution to A∣bandon the Siege, that in case it were not done, above 100 of them would desert, and fly to the Enemy. Whereupon the Doge took a Resolution before other Mis∣fortunes arrived, to comply with the Sol∣diery; and as a beginning thereof, to em∣bark all their Sick and Wounded Men, and Baggage;The Siege raised. and that the Enemy should not discover the Design, it was ordered, That the Cannon which were not drawn off from the Lines, Bonnet, and Batteries should conti∣nue still to play upon the City. After which, by degrees, all the remain∣ing Cannon was shipped, and many of their Horse embarked; and all things put in or∣der for an entire Desertion of the Island and Siege; which when the Grecian Inhabitants observed; who had taken the part with the Venetians against the Turks, full of Fear, and terrified Consternation, came running to the Shoar, petitioned to be carried off to the Christian Coast, to avoid the Fury of the Turks; for performance of which, all the Boats and Vessels of the Island were taken up at Freight for Service of the Army, and Transportation of the Islanders; of which several of them were cut off by the Turks, before they could reach the Vessels on which they intended to embark.Some dis∣order. The Turks see∣ing their Enemies draw off, and commit themselves unto the Seas, had cause suffici∣ent to rejoyce; as the Christians had to be sad and dejected, when the Rear of the Ar∣my was forced to betake themselves to a precipitate Flight with some Confusion and Disorder.Octob. 22. Howsoever they all got Aboard on such Vessels, as they could at first come unto, so that the lighter Vessels were over∣charged with Soldiers, and with Islanders, until such time, as at the adjacent Islands, where Vessels usually Careen, they could more orderly dispose their Companies, and repart them by a more commodious, and proportionable share unto every Ship, Ga∣leass, and Gally. From this place Orders were given by the Doge unto Venier Captain Extraordina∣ry, to pass into the Archipelago,Orders gi∣ven to the Admirals, and places appointed where to disbark the Soldi∣ers. to collect the Contribution of the Island. Admiral Zaguri was dispatched with four Ships la∣den with Provisions and Bisket, to furnish the Fortresses of that Kingdom. The Ves∣sels laden with the Horse, were ordered to disembark them at the first Shoar, and thence to march by Land to Napoli di Romania. Some other Companies were Landed at the Fortress of Termizi. All the Foreign Troops were put into Winter Quarters in divers parts of the Morea.Novemb. Other Companies and Troops Embarked on the Squadron of Ships commanded by Captain Pisani, were Tran∣sported to Modon, Navarin, and Patras; from whence Pisani had Commission to Sail for Zant and Corfu, and thence to carry all the Provision and Ammunition which had been brought thither from Venice for Use, and Refreshment of the Army. All the Gale∣asses were ordered unto the secure Port of Varvaronda under Cranidi in Romania. The Regiments of Brunswick, Wirtemberg, and Hesse, having compleated their time stipulated for Service, were discharged, and permitted to Sail for Venice.
Thus all the Troops being dismissed, and sent into their Wintet Quarters, the Doge intended himself to Land at Napoli di Ro∣mania;The Dge Lands very sick. but being taken short by the Wind, he could only fetch the Port Tolon, where the next Day he Landed, and went to Na∣poli di Romania, but in an ill condition of Health, caused partly by the Hardships of the Siege, but chiefly by the Troubles and Affliction of Mind for the Loss and Dis∣grace he had sustained before the City of Negropont; a great cause of which being attributed to the Miscarriage of some Offi∣cers, who performed not their Duty in the last Attack, he ordered a Process to be made against them, and their Tryals to be managed at a Counsel of War. But here we will leave the Venetians for this whole Winter, and return to the Wars in Hungary, transacted in the Year 1689; at the end of which, we shall recount all the Actions performed by the Venetians during that Campaign. But Procurator Girolamo Cornaro was more fortunate and successful in Dalmatia, and Albania, where he Com∣manded the Venetian Army: For having Landed his Forces at Scardona on the 24th of August,Cornaro marches a∣gainst Clin. they speedily marched towards Clin, with design to invest that place; and on the 27th, the several Troops took their Posts, and began a Line of Circumvallati∣on, fortifying the same with several Re∣doubts. The next Day Summons were sent to the Garrison, which being answered with Vollies of small and great Shot, the Night following the Trenches were open∣ed, and in the Morning the Cannon and Mortars began to play upon the Town with great execution. Septemb.In the space of two Days a considerable Breach was made in the first Wall, which the Besieged labouring to repair, the Can∣non quickly ruin'd their Works.The Vene∣tians stom the Breach. So that by the 1st of September, the Venetian Tren∣ches were advanced so far, and the Breach made so wide, that it was resolved to give an Assault, which was accordingly executed on the 2d of this Month, and performed with such Resolution, that the Venetians notwithstanding the Vigorous Opposition of the Enemy, mounted the Breach, on which having lodged themselves, obliged the Defendants to retire within their second Wall, or Retrenchment. On the 3d and 4th, several new Batte∣ries were raised, from whence the Enemy was greatly annoyed; and a Bomb falling into their Magazine of Powder, blew up, and killed many of the Inhabitants; how∣ever the Defendants still continued to main∣tain their Castle and the Lower Town, with great Resolution. At length it being ob∣served by General Cornaro, that one side of the Town was naturally fortified by Wa∣ter, without other Guard or Defence; he ordered, that the Regiments of Corbon and Sebenico, should pass over, and streighten the Enemy on that side, the which they chearfully performed; for most of them being practised Swimmers, they carried their Swords naked in their Mouths, and swam over to the other side; which when the Turks observed, fearing to have their Retreat cut off from the Castle, they quit∣ted the defence of the Breach, and retired some within the second Retrenchment, and others into the Castle.They b∣come Ma∣sters of the first Re∣trenchment Thus the Venetians without farther opposition, entered the first Retrenchment, where they found some pie∣ces of Cannon, 50 Horses, two Camels, some Mules, 100 Head of Oxen, some Corn, and a good quantity of Hay. The Venetians having gained the first Re∣trenchment, appointed Marquis Borro, and Francisco Grimani, to maintain the Ground they had gained; which they performed by throwing up Earth for shelter of their Men, whilst on the other side they cut off the Pipes, and ruined the Aqueducts which conveyed Water to the Castle.The Turks in want of Water. The want whereof, and the blowing up of the Maga∣zine of Powder, greatly sunk the Courage of the Defendants; howsoever the Veneti∣ans continued still to throw their Bombs and Fire into the Castle, and batter the Walls of it with their Cannon, by which they had now made the Breach so wide, that an Assault might be made thereon: But the Proveditor-General well considering that the Turks could not long subsist without Water, deferred for some few Days the Assault, un∣til he saw the Effects which the Extremity of Thirst would constrain them unto, the which speedily happened out according to expectation: For on the 12th of September, the Defendants spread a White Flag on the Walls, desiring to Capitulate, and that in the mean time a Cessation of Arms should be granted. Hereupon the Pasha of the place,They Capi∣tulae. sent out two Aga's, who being conducted to the Tent of General Cornaro, they offered the Surrender of the Town and Castle, upon License given them to march out with their Arms, and Baggage, as is usually granted to Valiant Soldiers. But Cornaro answer'd, That their Behaviour had not merited such kind and honourable Usage: And growing angry at their Discourse, he told them plain∣ly, That he expected they should immedi∣ately yield at Discretion, without farther Argument, or Capitulation. The Turks a∣stonished at this peremptory Resolution, desired time to propose the same to the Gar∣rison, and to the Inhabitants; but no more time would be allowed than four Hours;
during which, in case they did not submit, they threatned them with the last Extremi∣ty. Within the space of four Hours, the same Aga's returned again, declaring their necessity to submit to the hard Conditions of the Conquerors; and soon after they were follow'd by the Pasha Atlagick, attend∣ed with his Son and Nephew, and with Cernigick the Sangiack,They Sur∣render at Discretion. and five Aga's, with 50 other Turks of Condition; who being conducted to the Tent of General Cornaro, they were received by him in quality of Slaves; howsoever to demonstrate the Ge∣nerosity of the Conqueror, an Allodgment was assigned them in a Tent provided for them, where they were treated with all Conveniencies, both of Victuals and Lodg∣ing. The Day following in the Morning, a∣bout 900 Women and Children came forth, and about 400 Turks capable to bear Arms, with Countenances full of Sorrow, and de∣jected Looks, which showed the inward Grief which oppressed their Spirits. These were follow'd by a Troop of 150 poor Chri∣stians, who having hereby regained their Liberty, and Freedom from Slavery, chan∣ged the Scene of Sorrow into another of Joy and Festivity. 22 Pieces of Brass Can∣non were found in the place, 200 Horse, great quantities of Provision and Ammuni∣tion both for War, and Sustenance for Life. Clin being in this manner surrendered, the Proveditor Girolamo Cornaro, General in Dalmatia, designed to take Narenta, an an∣cient Port for all sorts of Merchandize, brought thither in former Times from Thrace,Cornaro designs a∣gainst Na∣renta. Servia, Bosnia, and Macedon, and several o∣ther Provinces; but first it was esteemed necessary in order thereunto, to become Masters of a small Tower called Narino, built about three Years before, by the Pa∣sha of Bosnia, who had furnished it with some Guns, and encompassed it with a double Palisado.October. In pursuance of this Resolution, the General embarked at Spalatro, all his Troops, Provisions, Cannon, and other Military Appurtenances; with which ha∣ving loosed from that Port, they were so crossed by contrary Winds, that the Fleet was forced to put into divers Harbours, and the Winds continuing long in that Quar∣ter, they spent some Weeks without any Action. At length the General being wea∣ried with longing Desires to act something, the Season of the Year also spending apace, and the time approaching both for the Fleet and Armies to draw into Winter Quarters, he resolved to proceed from the Port of St. George de Lesina with the Gallies, Galle∣ots, and lighter Vessels only, leaving Or∣ders with General St. Paul, to follow him with the Ships, and Galleasses, so soon as Wind and Weather should serve him: And being by force of the Oar come to the Mouth of the Port of Narenta; at the Point of which, the Fortress of Narin was situated: Cornaro Landed some Troops both of Horse and Foot; upon whose approach,He takes Narin. the Turks of the Garrison of Narin, to the Number of 150, finding themselves battered by Cannon from the Galley called Querini; they quitted the Fort, and betook themselves to a hasty Flight, in hopes to escape with their Liberty; but being pursued by the Horse, and some Morlacks who were good Footmen, they were either cut to pieces, or taken Prisoners, amongst which was Alaibegh Ca∣rovaz, their Commander in chief. The Venetians being encouraged by this Success, the General marched to a certain Village, called Metrovich, where he remained some Days in expectation of the Fleet under the Command of General St. Paul; and of be∣ing thereby reinforced with Men, Artillery, Provisions, Ammunition, and all things ne∣cessary. By this unexpected Invasion,The Mor∣lacks waste the Country. all the People of those Countries being greatly alarm'd, and in much Consternation, provi∣ded to save and put themselves into a po∣sture of defence. Howsoever the General Cornaro having made several Detachments of Morlacks to waste the Country round, they had the Fortune to surprize divers Villages and People, which they having first Plundered, put all to Fire and Sword, and returned with a considerable Booty both of Cattle, Captives, and Heads. But the Winds still continuing opposite to the Ships of Burden; and by Rains,The Fleet of Ships stopt by contrary Winds. and blustering Weather according to the Season of the Year, which was now far advanced and improper for Action, General Cornaro having secured the Country and Forts which he had conquered, embarked the remainder of his Forces, and returned to Spalatro, where he disposed his harassed Troops in Winter Quarters,Cornaro returns to Spalatro. there to refresh and take Breath against the next Campaign. After which, above 1500 Inhabitants of the Country about Narenta came in, and put themselves under the Protection of the Republick. And now after all these Actions, and Mar∣tial Exploits both by Sea and Land; of which the Turks have had little cause to boast in all the course of the past Year, un∣less in their defence of Negropont; it will be time for us to conclude this Years Hi∣story, and proceed to the Transactions of the following, being the Year 1689.
The Successes of the GERMANS, AGAINST THE TURKS in Hungary, In the Year 1689. THIS Year begins with the Sur∣render of the strong City of Si∣ghet,January. to the Clemency of His Imperial Majesty, not being sub∣dued by Arms, but by Famine, having almost for the space of two Years endu∣red extream Want, and Scarcity of all things necessary for the Support of Life. At length common Reports flying, That Sighet was upon Capitulations reduced thereunto by extream Want, and a thousand other mi∣serable Sufferings; the News thereof came confirmed to Vienna by the Duke of Hol∣stein, on the 21st of January, and that the Surrender was agreed on Articles, not much differing from those of Alba Regalis; after the Example of which, one or two Commissioners were appointed in behalf of the City to carry the Particulars unto Vien∣na, there to be Signed by His Imperial Ma∣jesty; for which Affair, the Person depu∣ted was Hassan Bei, Lieutenant Governour of the place; who on the 28th Day of Ja∣nuary arrived at Vienna, desiring that the fol∣lowing Capitulations might be confirmed and corroborated by the Imperial Signa∣ture, which were expressed in this man∣ner. I. THAT so soon as Hassan Bei shall be returned to Sighet, the Governour, and Garrison therein, shall faithfully de∣liver up into the Possession of the Ger∣mans, the Castle and City of Sighet, with all the Powder therein without spoiling it, or maliciously suffering it to be made wet, as also all other things belonging to Military Services. That upon the Sur∣render, the Turks shall retire to such place in the Lower City, as shall be assigned for their Quarters to lodge in, and there protected by a Guard of Imperial Soldi∣ers; there to remain until the rigour of the Winter Season is past, and the Drave become Navigable, by Thawing of the Ice; and in the mean time Waggons and Boats shall be provided for their faithful and secure Transportation; and till such time the Arms which belong to them in quality of Soldiers, shall be deposited in some safe place, and be thence returned to them upon their Departure. All things belonging to the Castle shall remain, as upon Delivery: And because it is uncer∣tain, when the River will be open, and become Navigable, so soon as the Ice is Thawed, and the Carts provided, a fixed Day shall be set for Departure of the Turks, after which they shall not stay longer than 24 Hours: And in the mean time they shall lodge quietly in the Lower Town free from all Molestation, Damage, or Insolence of the Soldiers. II. All Prisoners in the Hands of the Turks, without concealing any, or Per∣swasions, Allurements, or Promises to stay, shall be set at liberty, be they of what Age, Sex, or Quality soe∣ver. III. That all Conveniences and Neces∣saries shall be allowed to the Turks for their Money, as well in their Journey, as in the time of their present Aboad. IV. That no Violence shall be offered to any upon their Departure. V. That Carts, or Waggons shall be provided, as well for the Old, as for o∣thers, to carry them to the Water-side. VI. All those who became Renegadoes before this War began, shall have Licence to depart in Company with the Turks; but such others as have denied their Faith,
since the beginning of these Wars, shall not be permitted to depart with the o∣thers, but shall remain still in the City: And whosoever shall desire to stay behind, and live at their former Habitations, shall be left to their own Wills and Arbitre∣ment, to do as they shall think fit. VII. A sufficient number of Waggons shall be provided to carry all the People to the Water-side; where in like manner a sufficient number of Boats shall be fur∣nished, to Transport the People, under a secure Guard to the Confines of the Otto∣man Dominions. All these Articles being subscribed by His Imperial Majesty, a strict charge was gi∣ven to all Officers, and Soldiers, and Sub∣jects whatsoever, to observe religiously the Contents thereof: But before the same had passed the Imperial Signature, the Vice-President of the Council of War, summon∣ed Hassan Bei several times to Audience; and at length upon Delivery of the Capi∣tulations into his Hands, he made a most Elegant Speech, exalting the generous Pie∣ty and Clemency of the Emperour; who having all the Inhabitants and Soldiers of Sighet in his Hands, and at his Disposal, so as either to put them to Death, or make them Captives, was yet pleased, out of a Natural Principle of Mercy, to consider their Distresses, to spare their Lives, and give them Liberty. In sense of which, Hassan Bei acknowledged the truth of what had been uttered, and in token of Thanks to the Vice-President, in the Name of the Pasha, and People of Sighet, with Eyes full of Tears he received the Capitu∣lations, and kissed them with profound Re∣verence and Submission. So soon as Hassan Bei had received these Capitulations he departed with all speed by the Post towards Sighet, being fully satisfied with the obliging Entertainment he had re∣ceived during his stay at Vienna, where he was sumptuously lodged in the House of Marquis Ferdinando Obizzi. Hassan Bei being returned with the Ar∣ticles subscribed, to Sighet, no time was lost to put them into execution; for all things being prepared, and the River open about the beginning of February,February. the Turks quit∣ted Sighet, leaving one of the chief For∣tresses in the World, esteemed both by Na∣ture and Art to be impregnable, in the Hands of the Emperour. Sighet.For Sighet hath both a Castle and a City fortified after the ancient manner, with Earth lined with Brick; hath four very fair Towers encompassed with a very deep Ditch full of Water, and environed round with Fens and Marshy Grounds, which make the Town inaccessible. So that it seems no wonder, that Solyman the Magnificent Em∣peror of the Turks should have spent three Years in taking thereof; and not being a∣ble to take it in his Life time, his Grand Vizier afterwards subdued it by Storm, with the loss of 36000 Men. The Turks took it on the 7th of September 1566, after a most valiant Resistance made by Nicholas Esdrin Count of Serini, Great Grandfather of the Famous Nicholas Serini, who vanqui∣shed the Turks in many Battels, and died in the Year 1664. The Town hath three Gates, one called Quinque Ecclesiae, another Siclos, and a third Canisia, because they lead to those places. The Castle is fortified with three Walls, and a treble Ditch, and is the Capi∣tal City of that Province so named: There are three Moschs, all stately Buildings, and covered with Lead: The Country round is Pleasant and Fruitful; especially one Hill about two Miles from the City, which the Turks call Turbe Doggi, which was rarely planted with Vines, and all sorts of Fruit-Trees, and is famous for Cherries of an extraordinary bigness, of which there are none so good either in Hungary, or in any part of the Ottoman Dominions; the Ponds and Lakes are filled with Fish, and the Woods yield store of Deer, Hares, Partridges, and all sorts of Game; so that no place in the World can afford greater plenty of all things to support Humane Life, or to furnish the Tables of the greatest Mo∣narchs. Howsoever Canisia refused to follow the Example of Sighet,Canisia refuses to surrender. being not as yet it seems reduced to such a Condition of Fa∣mine, as to oblige them to a Surrender, for living in hopes that the Turkish Ambassadors would be able by their Negotiations to ob∣tain a Peace, they suffered the utmost Ex∣tremities of Want, with much patience; that in reward thereof they might preserve their Dwellings and Lands, and obtain the Honour due to the Constancy of good Sol∣diers, and the Praise and Commendation of their Prince. In the mean time the Turkish Ambassadors pressed with much Importunity to be ad∣mitted unto Audience,The Turk∣ish Am∣bassadors desire Au∣dience. that they might de∣liver their Credentials, and execute the Commands of their Master: But the Im∣perial Ministers were not, it seems, so much in haste, intending first to deliberate in what manner they were to be received, and what Answers were to be given to their submissive Requests for Peace, a Matter un∣known before to the Turks, who since the beginning of their Empire, had never be∣fore
been acquainted with the manner of supplicating for Peace. But the Fortune of the World being now changed, and the Game running high on the Emperor's Hand, Expedients were contrived rather to return a plausible cause of denial, and a justifiable ground for continuing a War, than how to form and project advantageous Articles for a Peace. Howsoever the Resolutions being taken what to do, it was judged necessary to admit the Ambassadors to Audience, for by the Law of Nations that could not be refused; and so accordingly it was agreed, That on the 8th of February an Audience should be given them: In order unto which, two Days before, the Ambassadors were conducted from the Castle of Pottendorff, into the Suburbs of the City, and lodged in that Street called Landt Strass, being at∣tended by two Regiments of Foot:The Solem∣nity obser∣ved at the Audience. The Day appointed for the Audience being come, they were brought with a Party of Horse to the Gate of Carinthia about Two a Clock in the Afternoon, and there con∣signed up to the Guard of the City, from whence they proceeded to the Emperor's Palace in the manner following. In the first place two Turkish Chiauses on Horseback led the way, with Staves in their Hands denoting Peace or Amity, after whom came two led Horses, followed by the Secretary of the Ambassadors carrying the Credentials made up in Purses of Cloth of Gold, holding them up in his Hand, that they might be seen by the People who flocked in great Numbers to see this En∣try. After these followed several Attendants with led Horses, all richly Harnassed, and covered with Embroidered Cloths: Then came Zulfigar Effendi the Ambassador in the Emperor's Coach accompanied with Alex∣ander Maurocordato a Greek, Associate to Zulfigar, and Interpreter to the Grand Seig∣nior, together with Lacovitz the Imperial Interpreter. On the right side of the Coach walked the Ambassador's Footmen cloathed in Green, and on the left those of Maurocorda∣to, being Rascians with Liveries of Yellow; all which were followed by a numerous Train of Attendants belonging to the Am∣bassador, amongst which there was one Coach with the Ambassador's Kinsman, and Senior Tarsia, chief Interpreter to the State of Venice at the Ottoman Port, who were likewise attended with led Horses and Footman. In this manner being come to the Gate of the Palace, it was permitted only to the Ambassadors to enter into the first Court-Yard; the others alighted at the Draw∣bridge, and walked on Foot to the Stairs; whence the Ambassadors, with the Secreta∣ry carrying the Credentials before them, were conducted between the Guards of Archers and Halberdiers, to the first Anti∣chamber, being followed by great Crowds of People. In the mean time, whilst they were as∣cending the Stairs,The Empe∣ror seated on his Throne. His Imperial Majesty came out of his private Apartment, and entered into the Chamber of Audience, and seated himself under a rich Canopy of State opposite to the Entrance into the Chamber, having the chief Princes and Ministers of State ranked on each Hand according to their several Degrees and Qualities.They are admitted to his Pre∣sence. Then were the Ambassadors admitted in, without other Attendance than their Secretary, who carried the Credentials before them; they were then conducted to the Foot of the Throne, the Turk wearing his Turbant on his Head, and Maurocordato carrying his Cap in his Hand, with his Head uncovered after the Christian manner. Zulfigar Effendi having made three very low Bows in his approach to His Majesty, took the Creden∣tials into his Hands, and with another pro∣found Obeisance, was offering to present them; when His Majesty making a Signal with his Hand, they were laid on a Side-Table near the Chair of State; and then both one and the other kneeled a lit∣tle, and kissed the Hem of the Imperial Mantle: After which retiring at some distance back, Zulfigar Effendi made his Speech in the Turkish Language to this effect. The Ambassador's Speech. THE Most Puissant, and Great Emperor of the Musselmen, the Highest Mo∣narch of the Universe, Sultan Solyman Han, Son of Sultan Ibrahim Han, our Lord and Master, hath sent us to you, who are the Most High, and Most Glorious Emperor amongst the Christian Kings and Princes, to deliver this His Imperial Letter to You His Friend: The Summary Contents of which, is to signifie unto You, His Exaltation to the Throne of his Ancestors, which hath happened in the Year, or Hegeira 1099. on the 2d Day of the Month Meherem: And also to put ou in remem∣brance of the ancient Friendship, and mutual good Correspondence which passed between his Progenitors, and Your famous Predecessors with all Sincerity. And hath commanded s his Servants, to signifie unto You His Great Friend, the High Respect he bears in His Imperial Breast to the ancient Friendship which intervened between the Progenitors on both sides. May the High God inspire, and instill into the Hearts of both Monarchs, that which is profitable and best for the Devout Servants of God.
To this Speech His Imperial Majesty did not vouchsafe to return an Answer by Words from his own Mouth; because that as yet no Treaty was begun, nor the least step made thereunto; and likewise because that the Persons who brought these Letters were not qualified with the Character of Ambassadors, but rather of Messengers sent to prepare the way, in order to a stricter and closer Treaty; and therefore the Baron de Herbert, a Gentleman of the Emperor's Bedchamber, and Councellor of State, by Command of the Emperor, returned an Answer in the manner following. An Answer return'd by Baron Herbert. THE Most August, Puissant, and Invin∣cible Emperor of the Romans, King of Hungary and Bohemia, Arch-Duke of Au∣stria, &c. Our Gracious Lord hath heard and understood what hath been most humbly propo∣sed to His Sacred Caesarean Majesty, in the Name of the Most Serene, and Most Powerful Prince Sultan Solyman, notifying by You His Exaltation to the Throne. And whereas You have made mention of the ancient Friendship which intervened between the Ancestors of both these Sublime Monarchs; You are to reflect and consider, That it never entered into the Thoughts of His Imperial Majesty to trouble, or dissolve that friendly Correspondence; but would rather most sacredly have continued the same until this very Hour, had he not been most Unjustly Attacked, against the League, and Articles stipulated, and Sworn by both Monarchs, by which the Effusion of much Hu∣mane Blood would have been spared. Of all which, the Most Just God being Witness, hath Crowned the Peaceable Mind of Our Most Au∣gust Emperor with Wonderful Success, and Glorious Victories. Howsoever the Mind of His Imperial Majesty being still inclined to a Peace, he resolves so soon as he shall have read the Contents of the Letter, to give Order un∣to His Ministers to receive and consider what farther Proposals shall be given thereupon, and to enter into the Particulars of a Treaty; which is all that I am Commanded by my Imperial Master to say in this Matter. To which Zulfigar Effendi, made this short Reply. The Ambassador's Reply. THAT tho' many times most grievous Wars have arisen between Great Mo∣narchs, yet frequently, even in the heat there∣of a Peace hath unexpectedly ensued. And whereas they had been employed and dipatched from the Ottoman Port, on a Work so bene∣ficial and happy to a great part of Mankind, they did not doubt, but upon the Treaty and Conferences such Expedients would be found, as would bring all Matters to a happy Conclu∣sion. And farther he said, That he had ano∣ther Letter from the Grand Vizier directed to the President of War, beseeching His Majesty that he would be pleased to behold the same with a Gracious Eye. The Audience being in this manner end∣ed,The Am∣bassadors return from Audience. which lasted about the space of half an Hour, the Ambassadors (for so they were called in Turkish) returned from the Palace, in the same Form as they came thi∣ther, and conducted to their Lodgings, where at the Charge of the Emperor, a most sumptuous Dinner was provided for them, sufficient to entertain a Hundred Persons. Tho' the Ceremonies observed at this Audience, and the Honours and Treatment given to these Ambassadors, were much in∣feriour to those, which had at other times been shown to Persons dispatched on the like occasions from the Ottoman Port, yet the Concourse of the People, who are fond of new Sights, was not less numerous; all the Streets, Balconies, and Windows, being filled with Spectators, who came to behold the mean Reception of the debated Turks, who never came before to beg Peace, but with a proud and haughty Behaviour to give the Conditions of it. The next day the Ambassadors, much in the same manner, were conducted to Audience of Count Staremberg,A Treaty begun. and in his Coach, who was Marshal, and Vice-Pre∣sident of the Supream Council of War, in the absence of Prince Herman of Baden, who resided at Ratisbonne, in Quality of Plenipotentiary for his Imperial Majesty at the Diet. The Ambassadors being Intro∣duced into a Chamber of his Palace, and caused to Sit down at a Table opposite against him, they delivered the Vizier's Letter to him; which being Read, after some Complements which passed on both sides, they returned again to their Lodg∣ings. The Letters being afterwards Read,The Turks submissive. and Observed, contrary to the Custom of that Proud Nation, to contain unusual Expres∣sions of Submission, and earnest Desires for Peace, the Emperor appointed Four Commissioners to Treat with these Am∣bassadors; Namely, Count Kinnisek Great Chancellor of Bohemia, Count Straatman Great Chancellor of the Court, the Com∣missary General Count Caraffa, and Mar∣shal Count Staremberg.
These Commissioners being assembled together, with Baron Razinsky, Envoy Extraordinary from Poland, and the Ca∣valier Frederico Cornaro, Ambassador from the Republick of Venice to the Imperial Court, with his Secretary Capello, the Turkish Ambassadors were called to hold a Conference with these Ministers of the Allies, at a Palace belonging to the States of the Province of Austria; the which be∣ginning about Ten in the Morning, lasted until Three a Clock in the Afternoon: After which, several Conferences were held, at which Maurocordato was the chief Speak∣er,No step made to a Conclusion of Peace, by reason of the De∣mands made by the Turks. expressing himself in Latin, and some∣times in Italian; but in fine, Debates ended without making the least step to∣wards the Conclusion of a Peace; for the Turks, instead of yielding to any Proposal in favour of the Allies, required some of the Conquered Places to be restored to them; that Transilvania should pay a Tri∣bute to the Ottoman Port, as formerly; and that the Bloccades should immediately be taken away from before Canisia and Great Waradin; so that the Letters from the Grand Seignior and Grand Vizier contain∣ing nothing but General Terms, which testified their Desires of Peace, and their Negotiations, and Proposals far from any particular Condescentions, their Actions looked, as if they designed nothing more than to gain time, and to hear, and observe what progress the French made by their Arms in the Palatinate, and other parts of Germany. Their hopes in the French promises.Nor indeed were the Turks deceived in these Measures, being supported by the French Promises, and Arms, and without which, the Turks would have Condescended to any Conditions which the Emperor and his Allies might have offered: Not∣withstanding which, the Faith of the French was so low in the Esteem of the Turks, that had the Emperor in that Conjuncture proposed some little Advantages, which might have kept up the Credit of the Ottoman Power amongst their own People, a Peace would certainly have ensued, which some Years afterwards by the Wiles and Artifices of the French could not be obtained, nor the Turks inclined thereunto by foul or fair means, by overthrows in Battle, and loss of Towns, and a long continued Train of Misfortunes;The Ger∣mans blamed for not making a Peace. nor by the Mediations of England and Holland, offered by their respective Ministers to the Port, as may hereafter be declared; so that it is an unaccountable piece of Poli∣cy, the blame of which the World is apt to Charge on the Clergy, and the secret Partisans of France hidden in the Imperial Councels, there being at that time no ap∣parent Reason why the Applications and Overtures of the Turks were not Embraced, and improved to a Peace; For at that time the French had entered the Palatinate with Fire and Sword; and their Armies com∣mitting all sorts of Hostility, had entered the Archbishopricks of Mentz, Cologne, the Dukedomes of Juliers, Bergue, and other Places of Suabia; so that now it was manifest, the Emperor had the Wars of two mighty Powers to sustain, which had soon overwhelmed all Germany, had not a firm Alliance been made between England, Spain, Holland, and most of the Princes of Germany; which was brought about by a most miraculous Providence; which not being the Subject of this Hi∣story, we shall turn our Discourse to∣wards the Wars against the Turks; the Treaty with whom breaking off, the Ho∣stilities on both sides were carried on with the same Fierceness and Cruelty as before. The Turks contrary to their Natural Temper, were become extreamly humble, and Supplicant, debasing themselves to so low, and mean a Degree of Submission, that the Imperial Ministers suspected that some Design lay covered under their fawn∣ing Expressions, and over-acted Humility: All which would have appeared real, had not the French encouraged the Divan with Presents, and Promises of recovering all Hungary back, and something more,The French encourage the Turks to continue the War, if they would only reassume their Ancient Courage, and patiently support the Incon∣venience of a War for a few years longer; to incline them whereunto, the French sent the Turks a Minute Account of all the Vi∣ctories they had obtained over the Ger∣mans, what Cities and Towns they had destroyed, what Devastations and what Incursions they had made into the very Heart of Germany, with Fire and Sword; by which they had already rendered all those Provinces on the Rhine, so weak and miserable, that it was impossible for them to resist the violent Course of the French Arms, much less, when united with the Puissance of the Ottoman Empire. And to facilitate this Work,And en∣deavour to draw the King of Poland from his Alliance. several Engines were employed to Tamper with the Poles and Ambassadors sent to that King; one of which was Monsieur de Bethune, who was Brother to the Queen of Poland; and to quicken, and give life to this Ne∣gotiation, vast Sums of Money were sent, sufficient to blind and corrupt the Mind of an Avaritious Prince; and tho' these means were not productive of a Peace, yet they begot such cold Motions of War, as looked something like a Truce, or an indifferent Neutrality: And indeed, se∣veral
Campagnes after this were carried on with so slow a pace, that the Arms of Poland came not into the Field until it was almost seasonable to retire from thence;The Poles cold in their Act∣ings. and such Negligence was practised in their Martial Discipline, that they were com∣monly surprized by the Tartar, and de∣feated: And so little care taken to pro∣vide the Army with necessary food for Horse and Man, that in the year 1691, (as may hereafter be made appear) all the Horses of the Army died, even in the very Stables of the King, who was forced afterwards to return home in a Waggon drawn by Buffalo's and Oxen. Howsoever nothing was omitted on the part of the Emperor to carry forward two such important Wars, by several ways. And in the first place,The Empe∣ror encou∣rages the Bulgari∣ans and Rascians, to secure the New Conquests, it was thought necessary, to encourage the Bulgarians and Rascians, who had made a Defection from the Turks, and submitted themselves intirely to the Ser∣vice of the Emperor; and as a means to secure those People, Count Marsigli, the Chief Director and Surveyor of the For∣tifications, was dispatched to erect a For∣tress in some Place or other, the most con∣venient for Defence and Protection of those People; for which no place could be si∣tuate so advantageously as that of the Iron-Gate; which would very much have secured the Christian Conquests, and been a good Frontier, between which and Adri∣anople there was not the least Fortification in all that vast Country; nor from thence to the very Walls of Constantinople. Tho' the Emperor was greatly burdened by a War against France, and at the same time against the Turk, yet all Care was taken both in one and the other. The Imperial Chamber issued out vast Sums to Recruit the Militia in Hungary,And makes Preparati∣ons against the Turks. to Re∣mount their Artillery, and provide all sorts of Ammunition and Provisions for the next Campagne, with which the Ma∣gazines both in Servia and Sclavonia were supplied; as also Carriages, Bridges, Boats, and all sorts of Warlike Preparations, which were carried on by the great Industry of Count Caraffa, Commissary-General. In the mean time the Turks made conti∣nual Incursions into Bosnia, along the sides of the Rivers Unna, and Culpa, but with∣out much Success; they being on all sides streightned in their Quarters, and Marches by the Germans. For Piccolomini having notice, that the Pasha of Bosnia designed to over-run all the Country near the Save, detached some Parties of Hungarians and Germans from the Garrison of Proot, to discover the Actions of the Turks; and being in the night time advanced some Leagues into the Enemies Country, they surprized the Town of Lisnia, and set Fire to it, and killed all the Garrison, consisting of 500 men, some few only excepted, which they carried away Pri∣soners. But the Confusion at the Ottoman Court was much greater,A Rebelli∣on in Asia. by reason of a new Rebellion in Asia carried on by Yedic a famous Robber in that Country, and Part∣ner with Yeghen Pasha, whom we mentioned in our Treatise of the last Year; the which continued for some time before it was appeased, and Yedic cut off: But be∣fore we touch upon that Story, it will be necessary to declare the Fate of Yeghen, who had forced himself upon the Govern∣ment, and obliged the Vizier to Create him Seraskier, which happened in this manner. After that Yeghen had fled from Belgrade, he quarrelled with Noradin Galga,The Fate of Yeghen. Son of the Tartar Chan; upon which, Noradin be∣ing a Man of a high Spirit, called him Coward, and pitiful, mean spirited Rascal, fit for nothing but to Command a Band of Thieves and Robbers; at which Yeghen, who looked on himself as Seraskier, or General of the Army, was so enraged, that shaking his Topuz at him, (which is a kind of Iron-Mace,He kills the Prince of Tartary. carried by the Turks on the side of their Horses Saddle) caused him to be Strangled before the Eyes of many of the principal Men belonging to the Tartarian Court. The News of this Affront and Outrage committed on the Son, the very hopes of the House, highly enraged the Chan his Father;The Father meditates Revenge. who studying Night and Day a Revenge, wrote to the Grand Signior and Grand Vizier, in the most resenting Terms possible against Yeghen, urging, that that insolent and unhumane Robber was to be destroyed, without which, the Cause of the Musselmen could not be Blessed, nor any Fortune be expected against their Ene∣mies. But the Grand Vizier thinking himself under some Obligations to Yeghen, who had the Year before saved his life before Nissa; when the Janisaries mutinying for want of Pay, (he being then Janizar-Aga) conspired to Strangle him:The Grand Vizier fa∣vours Yeg∣hen. In remem∣brance of which, being now advanced to the sublime Office of Grand Vizier, he endeavoured to sweeten the matter, and render the case of Yeghen as plausible as might be. But such was the Misfortune of Yeghen, that the Tartar Chan coming in Person to Adrianople, to consult on such Measures as were necessary to be taken for the succeeding Campagne, he fell on his Quarrel with Yeghen, who had put
his Son to Death, urging to the Divan, that there was an unavoidable necessity for putting Yeghen to Death, as the Cause and Fomenter of all the Mutinies in the Army, and the Rebellions in Asia. Yeghen being advised by his Friends, and Correspondents, of which he had many at the Ottoman Court, of the Com∣plaints and Endeavours of the Tartar Chan against him, found himself not only there∣by defeated of his expected Confirmation in the Office of Seraskier, but in danger of the Evil which the Wiles and Accusa∣tions of an irreconcilable Enemy at the Court might bring upon him. Wherefore abandoning himself to Despair,Yeghen commits all sorts of Outrages. he began again to practise all sorts of Villainy, to rob Villages and Towns, entertaining all sorts of Robbers, Murderers, and Peo∣ple accustomed to Spoil, arrogating to himself a power of creating Pasha's, and exercising all sorts of Violence and Cru∣elty upon the Inhabitants of Romelia, or Greece. And moreover he wrote to his Friends and Acquaintance in Asia, parti∣cularly to Yedic, to Declare in favour of his Cause, which was also supported by the Authority of the Grand Vizier. Commands issued from the Port to take Yeghen either alive or dead.But the Grand Seignior and the Divan entertaining Sentiments different to those of the Vizier, consulting the necessity there was of gratifying the Chan, issued immediate Orders to the Pasha of Sofia to suppress the Incursions of Yeghen, and to Call to his Assistance the Nefiran, which are like our Trained-Bands, or Militia of the Country, to seize, and take, either Dead or Alive, this Yeghen Pasha, who had violated the Laws of their Prophet Mahomet, and encouraged and fomented all the Rebellions in Asia. This dismal News struck Yeghen with a sudden Amazement, so that not know∣ing where to find any safety in the Parts where he remained, all the World con∣spiring his Destruction,He flies into Al∣bania. he resolved to re∣tire into Albania, and betake himself to the Aid and Protection of his old and faith∣ful Friend Mamoot Bei Oglu; it having been suspected for some time, at the Port, that this Yeghen, whensoever he should be droven hard, would endeavour to shelter himself in Albania, under protection of this Mamoot Bei; means were contrived before-hand, with a thousand fair Pro∣mises made to Mamoot Bei, that when∣soever Yeghen should come for Refuge un∣der his Command, that he should do that Service to the Sultan, as to betray him, or cut him off. Accordingly Yeghen putting himself into the hands of his anci∣ent Comrade, Mamoot, was received by him with outward Joy, and the most Endearing Terms of Love, and real Sincerity, that could be expressed, and desiring him to continue with him for some days, he pro∣mised him all security, to joyn with him in his Adventures, and to run with him all the hazards of his Fortune; and so continued to Comfort and Encourage him, until all his Troops being got together,Mamoot Bei cuts off his Head. when one Night being in Consultation with Yeghen, in what manner they might with most Advantage annoy the Port, Orders were privately given to the Domestick Servants to fall upon him, which was ac∣cordingly executed, and his Head on a sudden taken from his Shoulders, with the Heads of many of his Followers, which were immediately dispatched by Mamoot to the Port, for a Testimony of his Fidelity to the Sultan, and in Reward thereof to Challenge the Promises which had been made him. In the Month of September last, as we have already related, News was brought to the Port, that the Disorders in Asia in∣creased, where the Robbers appeared in great Bodies, Commanded in chief by Yedic, and encouraged by Yeghen,Disorders in Asia by Yedic. who sent Commissions over to his Kinsman Yedic, by which such numbers of Rob∣bers assembled from all Parts, that all the Country was spoiled and laid waste by them; and the People being fled, there was nothing but Rapine and Violence in all Places. To suppress these Disorders, Commands were sent by the Vizier, to the Pashas and Governors; but these Of∣ficers were so far from being able to Exe∣cute them, that they returned back stripped and plundered. Whereupon new Mea∣sures were taken to pacifie these Muti∣neers or Robbers rather, with Promises, that Yeghen should be created General of the Army, and that these Troops now in Asia should be passed over into Hungary, there to Fight under the Command and Conduct of their Beloved Yeghen, where they all hoped to be made Pasha's. But whilst these Mutineers were preparing to march into Europe, News came to the Grand Signior of the Death of Yeghen, with many of his Followers; the which was confirmed by the undoubted Evidence of their Heads, which were laid at the Feet of the Sultan. This particular Acti∣on changed the whole Scheme of the Turkish Councils; and all the soft Pro∣mises made to Yedic,Defiance given to Yedic. were changed into Vengeance and Punishment, Orders being given to the Chimacam, not only to op∣pose and hinder the passage of the Asiaticks into Europe, but to Fight and Defeat them them in their own Country. By this time a great Party of these Rebels were come
very near to Scutari, and scattered in the adjacent Villages, where remaining with all security, not having as yet received the fatal News of the Death of Yeghen; when by Order of the Chimacam,A Party of his Soldi∣ers defeat∣ed. some of the Ottoman Troops quartered on the side of Scutari, fell upon them, and by surprize, entirely defeated them, some of which were drowned in the Sea, and others kil∣led by the Sword: Those who were al∣ready passed over to Constantinople, hearing of this Disaster, and the Fate of Yeghen, retired back into Asia, and recounted those unhappy Stories to Yedic, who was upon his March to follow his advanced Troops. Upon this News, Yedic, and his Compa∣nions, despairing of all hopes of Pardon, declared themselves more openly Rebels than before; so that assembling all the Scum and Rascality of the People, to the number of about 6000 Men,Yedic marches to Prusa, they marched towards Prusa in Bithynia, pillaging, de∣stroying, and ruining all in the way be∣fore them: So that there was no passage for any, unless Emirs or Green-Heads, mounted on Mules and Asses with Pack-Saddles. The Ottoman Court, which lately by the Death of Yeghen, and the Defeat of so many Troops near Scutari, thought all things now safe and secure from the Asia∣tick Rebellion, were again strangely sur∣prized with a Consternation to hear that the Rebellion increased, and grew hotter than before; to suppress which, a Pasha was sent to Prusa to raise the Nefiran, who had the Fortune at first to Defeat a considerable Body of the Enemy; but be∣ing a Person of no Experience in the War, and ignorant of Martial Discipline, he un∣fortunately engaged with a more expert Body of the Rebels,And de∣feats the Pasha. by whom he was de∣feated, and made a miserable Sacrifice to the Fury and Revenge of Yedic; who killed and made Prisoners, all the Forces of the Pasha. Yedic being encouraged with this un∣expected Success, caused himself to be Proclaimed,Declared King of Anatolia, besieges Angora. King and Soveraign of Ana∣tolia; and by his Arbitrary Power, laying Impositions, and exacting Contributions from all Cities and Towns of that Coun∣try, he laid Siege to Angora, a rich City, famous for the Trade of Grogram Yarn, who would not submit it self to the Ty∣ranny and Plunder of Yedic: Of which the English and other Merchants at Smyrna took such an Alarm, not knowing but that the Rebels, encouraged with the Riches and Openness of the Town, without any Walls or Fortifications, might march thi∣ther; they Packed up all their Goods, and put themselves in a readiness to fly on Shipboard when any Danger approached, where they might remain out of all dan∣ger or Violence either to their Persons or Estates. The People of Angora, being in a Con∣dition not long to withstand a Siege, and Despairing of all Relief from the Ottoman Port, made their Composition with Yedic,Angora pays a Ransome. and Ransomed their Town from Plunder, by the Payment of 80 Purses of Money, each Purse containing 500 Dollars. This unhappy State of Affairs, sug∣gested unto the Turkish Governors their old Methods of fair Promises, and smooth Words to work upon the Affections of Yedic and his Complices, assuring them all of Pardon and Reward in case they would return to their Duty:The Rebels refuse all Offers of Grace. But these being a sort of rough Villains, bred up in Rapine and Violence, who were Con∣scious that they could never merit a Par∣don, and had transgressed beyond all Hopes of ever being trusted, they no sooner heard the fawning Words of the Grand Seignior's Grace and Favour pronounced towards them, but with one Consent they cryed out loudly against it, saying, That they had learned not to be Cheated and Betrayed like Yeghen, and their Brethren near Scutari. And that their Rebellion might carry a good Face, and some Rea∣son with it, Yedic and his Complices de∣clared, That they took not up Arms for Spoil, or Disaffection to the Grand Seig∣nior, but out of pure Zeal to Religion, and true Profession of the Mahometan Law, which the present Governors had misera∣bly corrupted: In Defence of which he Summoned all the People and Inhabitants of Anatolia to come in under his Standard, and joyn with them to Reform the Abuses of the Government and State. These Traiterous Practices of Yedic be∣ing made known at the Port; it plainly ap∣peared, that there was no other means and expedient left, to reclaim the Practices of such Robbers, and suppress the dissolute Lives of Rebels, but only force and dint of Sword;The Nature of a Teftish Pasha. to which end the Pasha of that Country honoured with the Title of Tef∣tish, which is as much as an Inquisitor, who in the Times of Peace, is every two or three Years ordained to enquire into the State of Anatolia, and make enquiry into Robberies, Breaches of the Peace, and A∣buses of the Government committed by the Kadees, Aga's, and other Officers: For ex∣ecution of which, the Pasha is commonly attended with 500 Men, and authorized with such an unlimited power, that he may act and do what he pleases with as uncon∣troulable an Authority, as the Sultan him∣self. I have known this sort of Teftish in
the Summer time having pitched his Camp near some great Town, immediately to call for the Kadi, or Judge, and the Imaum or Priest of the place, and to demand of them the Names of the Lewd and Disorderly Young Men of the Place, and the Villages adjacent; and in case the Pasha, or the Imaum especially, shall give an ill Report of any of them, as of such, who come not constantly to Prayers, or frequent the Moschs, his Business is done for him; and for as many of them as come under his evil Report. For the Teftish Pasha conclu∣ding all such for Thieves, requires no far∣ther Testimony or Proofs against them; but sending for them, Condemns them, and Hangs them up on the next Tree. In this manner the Business of Yedic and his Complices, was committed to the care and conduct of Teftish Achmet Pasha, whose first step was rightly to inform the People of the perfidious Designs of Yedic, who fought against the Sultan and the Laws of the Pro∣phet Mahomet, of which the People being once perswaded, withdrew themselves from that Party, and turned their Arms against Yedic, and his Villainous Accomplices; by which means the Teftish having increased his Forces to such a considerable number, that he might with all security promise him∣self Victory, he marched against the Ene∣my, and after two Days, he came in sight of their Camp, and found them drawn up in good order, according to Martial Disci∣pline.The Teftish engages Yedic and defeats him. The Pasha readily attacked them with 3000 select and brave Men, and well mounted, and with such Resolution, that at the first Onset they put the Van-guard of the Enemy into disorder, and with a Shower of Arrows from the whole Army, they put them all to flight; so that their Leader Yedic, trusted all his safety to the swiftness of his Horse; notwithstanding which, the Teftish pressing for an entire Victory, pursued him so hard, that having inclosed him in the midst of two Squadrons, Yedic himself, with many of his chief Captains and Commanders, were either killed, or made Prisoners. The rest of the Common Soldiery seeing themselves depri∣ved of their Chief, submitted to the Teftish Pasha, desiring to be enrolled under his Ban∣ner; but the Pasha having no good opinion, or hope of getting any benefit from an Uni∣on with such a sort of Rabble, and Scum of the People, who had been bred up, and nursed in Robbery and Violence; resolved to make no use of such corrupted Compa∣nions in his Army, but dismissed them all with License to return to their Countries, and respective Habitations, and afterwards proceeded to reform the Abuses and Disor∣ders of those ill-govern'd Provinces. The Port having now entirely suppressed those two desperate Rebellions,Regeb Pasha made Ge∣neral in the place of Yeghen whose Ne∣phew is put to Death. the most dangerous of any in such a time of a de∣caying Militia, and a victorious Enemy, began to be at leisure to prepare for their War in Hungary; and in the first place Re∣geb Pasha was created Seraskier, or Gene∣ral, in the place of Yeghen: But first to ex∣tirpate all that Party entirely, they seized on the Nephew of Yeghen in Philippopolis, and put him to Death, with 40 of his Fol∣lowers; as they did also the Governor of Widin, whom Yeghen had put into that Place the last Campaign, being a Favourite and Creature of his. The Turks to encourage their People to prosecute the War in Hungary, did not only cause a Report to fly about, That the Sul∣tan had resolved to appear this Year at the Head of his Army against the Christians; but the Sultan did really march from Adri∣anople towards Sophia,The Grand Seignior marches to Sophia. with an Army of a∣bout 30000 Men, together with a Train of Artillery, consisting of 90 Pieces of Can∣non, and 6 Mortar-pieces of a very large size, the which being joyned afterwards to a Body of 40000 Men under the Command of the Seraskier Regeb Pasha, formed a con∣siderable countenance of an Army; but be∣ing all raw, and undisciplin'd Men, would, as was supposed, be inspired with new Cou∣rage at the presence of their Sultan. On the 15/25 of April,April. the Grand Seignior began to move from Adrianople, at which time a very great Earthquake was felt both in that City and Constantinople,An Earth∣quake a∣bout the time of the Grand Sig∣niors De∣parture. which was so terrible, that several Moschs, Houses, and Towers were overthrown. At which time the Tungia and Meritz, Rivers which glide on a Sandy and Gravelly Soil near the Walls of Adrianople, overflowed their Banks with so violent an Inundation, that they Drowned all the Fields and Meadows round, and forced the Turks to remove their Camp, and pitch at some farther distance; the which Accidents were diversly discoursed by the Learned Men, and the Turks being natural∣ly Superstitious, did generally interpret them as sinister Omens for the succeeding Campaign. Howsoever Sultan Solyman march∣ed forwards to Sophia; where according to the Custom of the Turkish Army, they soiled their Horse, giving them Grass, and remained in expectation of the arrival of the Asiatick Troops, and other Forces not yet come up; and here it was that the Sul∣tan entertained himself in the Army, not intending to proceed nearer to the Ene∣my. In the mean time great Conferences and Consultations were held at the Imperial Court, for carrying on two mighty Wars a∣gainst France, and the Ottoman Empire; to
which end the Forces were divided; those which were to serve in the Empire against France, were committed to the auspicious Conduct of the Elector of Bavaria, and the Duke of Lorrain: Those which were intend∣ed against the Turk in Servia, were to be commanded by that Valiant and Fortunate General Prince Lewis of Baden; and under him as Field Marshal by the Duke of Croy, General of the Artillery was Marquis Pa∣rella, Lieutenant-General was Count Vete∣rani, and Major-Generals were the Counts of Hoffkirchen, Duke of Holstein, with the Princes of Hanover and Heisler: And on the other side in the Upper Hungary, Tran∣silvania, Bosnia, and Sclavonia, the Com∣mand was lodged in the Hands of the Counts Aspremont, Piccolomini, Trautmansdorff, Gui∣do of Staremberg, Herbeville, and Baron Herbeville; whose force consisted of 11 Re∣giments of Cuirassiers, nine Regiments of Dragoons, and 20 Regiments of Foot; together with the several Independant Com∣panies of Hungarians, Croatians, and Rasci∣ans, who had lately taken up Arms against the Turks. In the mean time Tekeli, to keep up his Credit and Reputation with the Turks, cau∣sed a Report to spread abroad at the Ottoman Port; that by his Spies, and by his Let∣ters of Advice, he had certain Intelligence, that the French had so distressed the Empire, that it was impossible for the Emperor to spare at that time above 10000 Men to car∣ry on the War in Servia; and that all his Measures in Transilvania, and the Upper Hungary, were entirely broken. And indeed by the Plots of Tekeli, and the Contrivances and Intrigues of the French, whose Emissaries began now to spread in all the great and considerable Towns, as well in Hungary as in Germany, Towns and Countries were burnt, and vast Devastati∣ons committed thereon. The City of Cron∣stadt in Transilvania, was in the Month of May totally destroyed and consumed by fire,May. which was kindled at the four Angles there∣of;Plots of the French discovered. which in a few Hours, by the help of a strong Wind, was reduced to Ashes, not∣withstanding the Endeavours of Colonel Ba∣ron de Pace to extinguish it; only by the help of his Soldiers he preserved the Castle, and the Ammunition therein, notwithstand∣ing the Flames, which by the forcible Winds were carried to the very Walls of it. At the same time the like Misfortune befel the For∣tress of Honot in the Upper Hungary, and the Citadel of the Jews at Prague, so that both one and the other were in a few Hours miserably reduced to Ashes; all which was suspected to have been done by Treasonable Practices, and not by Chance, or Accident; and that which gave undoubted Assuran∣ces thereof, were certain Sacks of Powder found at the Gates of some Houses in Vi∣enna; and a Fire breaking out in a House adjoyning to the great Hospital of the Ci∣ty, being kindled at a time when the Wind was very high, put all the City into a great Combustion; but by the Vigilance of the Magistrates, and the activeness of the Sol∣diers, it was soon extinguished: The which horrid Practices were some Days afterwards discovered to have been acted by certain Frenchmen, who being convicted by course of Justice, were sentenced, as Incendiaries, to be cast into the Fire, and committed to the Flames. The which Tryals and Proofs being produced, and laid before the Council of State, extorted from the benign Nature of His Imperial Majesty, a severe Edict for Banishing all the French out of his Do∣minions,The French Banished out of the Empire. unless such as had been Naturali∣zed, or for the space of 10 Years past, could prove their Abode, or Residence with their Wives, established in some City, were all, without any exception, to depart in the space of 14 Days. The which Edict, how severe soever it might seem at another time, was in the present Conjuncture no less than necessary, when the French Nation was crept into every City and Country, and entertained for Valets de Chambre, Pedants, Dancing Masters, Cooks, and such like in most of the Houses and Families of Prin∣ces, and Nobles of principal Quality; where they served for Spies, and Traytors to the Empire: But the Wars in Germany not be∣ing the Subject of this History, let us pro∣ceed to the Affairs of Turkey, where it was reported, That the Turks were assembling all the force they were able to recover the City of Belgrade; and that the Seraskier was already in the Field, and had prepared Bridges to pass the Morava above Jagodi∣na; and began to march so fast, as if he intended to force Belgrade, before the Grand Vizier was joyned with him, the noise whereof caused some Consternation at Bel∣grade; but at the appearance of Prince Lewis of Baden,Pr. Lewis coming to the Army, encourages the Soldi∣ers. sent thither with Commis∣sion of General of the Imperial Forces in Hungary, all the Fears of the Soldiers va∣nished; and every one reassumed his Cou∣rage, and at the Command of the Prince, fell to work about the Fortifications; the which Work being by direction of His Highness put into a way of dispatch; he proceeded forward to the Army. And on the 14th of June,June. being arrived at Semendria, he made it his business in the first place to enquire, and inform himself of the true State of the Affairs of the Enemy, who according to common report of the Spies, were said to be very near, being en∣camped in the Plains of Jagodina, to the
Number of 40000 Men under Command of the Seraskier, the greatest part of which were Asiaticks, raw, and Undisciplin'd Sol∣diers, to which very speedily the Grand Vizier was to joyn with 10000 Turks, and a considerable Train of Artillery, which was already on the way from Sophia.Reports of the Turks Power, a∣larm Pr. Lewis. The Prince being alarm'd hereat by reason of the small force he had with him, dispatched an Express away to the Counts of Veterani and Piccolomini, with Orders to hasten their March what was possible, and come to his necessary reinforcement against so formida∣ble an Enemy; and in the mean time, the heavy Baggage was sent to Belgrade, with about 30000 Inhabitants of that place, who for their better security, were ordered to pass the Save: But for the more certain Intelli∣gence of all, the Prince dispatched an Ex∣press to Hassan Pasha Palanca,Hassan Pasha Pa∣lanca. where Count Hoffkirchen was Quartered, to know of him what News he had received there from the Camp of the Enemy. At this Palanca I lodged one Night, as I remember, which is no other than a small Fortress built of Stone in a Woody and a Desolate Country, at the Charge of one Hassan Pasha, with intent only to cover a Chan, or Inn for Reception of Travellers, and their Goods, from Spoil∣ers and Robbers, which often infested that place, where notwithstanding by means of this Fort, Garrison'd by 60 Soldiers, Stran∣gers may sleep, and remain secure from Robbers. The Messenger being returned from Hoff∣kirchen, brought Intelligence that the Turks were neither so numerous, and strong, nor so near, as common Fame reported: And they only appeared sometimes in Parties on the River Morava, but with some Care, and Caution in apprehension of the Ger∣mans, whose Numbers tho' they knew not, yet they were sensible enough of their Va∣lour and Vigilance. This News, and the Conjunction with the Militia of Veterani and Piccolomini,Veterani and Pic∣colomini joyn with Pr. Lewis. greatly encouraged, and animated the Prince; and more especially, because that Piccolomini had passed a Bridge over the Save, between Belgrade and Sawaz, for the more commodious Transportation of Ammunition, and Victuals, which came from the Parts of Hungary. In the mean time Tekeli did not remain idle, but made several Incursions, with de∣sign to relieve Temeswaer, Giula, and Wara∣dine, which were streightly blocked up by the Imperialists: In which, tho' he did not succeed, yet having joyned with the Pasha of Silistria, he fell upon Fetislau, a Garri∣son of the Rascians,Fetislau en by Tekeli which after a stout de∣fence for 12 Days, and having no hopes of succour, they were forced to yield at Discre∣tion, and being made Prisoners, several of the principal Men, with their Colours, were sent in triumph to the Grand Seignior, who in recompence thereof, sent a Scimetar, a Vest of Sables, and some Money unto Tekeli, (with an Aferum) or You have well done, and do still better. Tekeli having put a Garrison of 1000 Janisaries into Fetislau, he marched to Orsoua, a place which Heisler had lately deserted and demolished, which he possessed, and delivered it into the Hands of the Prince of Walachia, to be Garrison'd,And possess Orsoua. and made a place of Arms, and a Maga∣zine for divers sorts of Provisions and Am∣munition expected from Nicopolis; and which, if well fortified and provided, might be considered, as the Key of the Upper Hungary. About the same time, Count Corbelli made a Detachment of 1000 Heydukes, from the Blockade of Waradine, who approaching near the Walls with intention to carry off the Cattle which were feeding thereabouts, they were so furiously attacked by the Ene∣my, that before they could retreat,300 Hey∣dukes kil∣led by the Turks. they lost 300 of their Men, and amongst the rest Captain Tugnochy, a Valiant Soldier, who the last Year had signalized himself on various occasions against the Turks. This Loss was soon afterwards recompen∣sed by the Success which the Croats gained upon the Turks; who having formed a Bo∣dy of about 8000 Men, intended to spoil all the Country round about Costanovitza, near the River Unna. On the other side the Croats, to the Number of 2000 Men, under the Command of Count Drascovitz, marched against them, with design rather to view the Countenance of the Enemy, than to give them Battel; took their March through certain Woods and Mountains, and unfrequented Ways; when happily near a place called Czrin,The Croats defeat a great Body of the Turks. they met a strong Party of Turks, who were come out also to disco∣ver the Enemy; and having espied the Croats, and believing them to be of greater force than they really were, they betook themselves to Flight; but being pursued by the Croats, several of them were taken Prisoners; and by them it was known, that 8000 Turks, or thereabouts, under the Command of Sar Mustapha Pasha, lay en∣camped not far from that place. Upon these Advices the Count and his Croats resolved bravely to attack the whole Camp; which being performed without o∣ther Hesitation or Delay, and taking a short Turn about some little Hills, they charged the Turks with such Fury, that they being surprized with some Consternation, the Spahees betook themselves to Flight, lea∣ving 2000 Janizaries open and undefended, who all yielded themselves Prisoners at discretion; of which some intimation ha∣ving
been given to the Croats on the Con∣fines, they marched with such haste, that they met the Spahee's in their Flight; and the Bridges being broken down, the great∣est part were made Prisoners, besides many who endeavouring to Swim were Drowned in the Waters;A compleat Victory. in which Action the Croats took 11 Colours, and much Booty. In this Fight the Flower of the Militia of Bosnia was cut off; and the Ways were covered with dead Bodies for the whole length of an Hungarian Mile; of which many of them by the finery of their Clothing, were judg∣ed to be Persons of Quality: The Com∣mander in Chief, called Sar Mustapha Pasha Kaja, with the Bey, or the Lieutenant-General, were taken Prisoners; and accord∣ing to the Report of those who came to en∣quire after some who were missing, there were 6000 Men killed and scattered: In which Action very few Croats were killed, or wounded. Count Corbelli having intelligence that the Turks of Jeno and Giula intended to for∣tifie Fechedebator, in revenge for his late Misfortune, resolved to use his Endeavors to surprize the Castle, and thereby save the Turks the trouble of their intended Fortifi∣cations; and in order thereunto he mount∣ed the Regiment of Gondola on Horseback, and with 500 Hussars, and 100 Musqueteers, and about as many Heydukes, which he had mounted on Waggons, he passed the River Geresch in sight of the Garrison of Waradin, who had drawn out about 2000 of their Men into the Field: But to amuse the Ene∣my, Corbelli marched to and again the whole Day; and at Night he detached two great Bodies of Hussars before, to take cog∣nisance of the place; and being come near to Fechedebator, they took two Rascians Pri∣soners belonging to the place, by whom they understood that there were not above 50 armed Turks in the place, besides some few Rascians; for the greatest part of the Garrison were gone to Jeno, to solemnize the Marriage of a certain Person of chief Quality in that Country; upon which in∣telligence the Party sent to discover only, without farther design,Corbelli Summons Fechede∣bator. meeting this Op∣portunity, and resolving not to lose it, sent immediately a Summons to the Castle to surrender; to which the Turks returning an impertinent and scornful Answer; and say∣ing, That when he brought the Keys of their City with him, meaning Giula, Jeno, and Waradin; upon taking of which, they should be forced to surrender, that then they would open their Gates to them; until which time they craved their excuse, in∣tending to defend themselves to the utmost Extremity. At the same moment that this Answer was returned, a Rascian who had made his Escape out of the Town, advised that there was a great Division arisen a∣mongst the Turks in the Castle, of the which Corbelli desirous to make use, he cau∣sed the Regiment of Gondola to pass the River on Horseback, and the Foot on Fer∣ry-Boats and Floats, and being on the other side, he drew up in order of Battle in sight of the Fortress, threatning them, that in case they did not surrender in the space of one quarter of an Hour, that he would give no Quarter to any Person whatsoever. The Governor of the Castle being terri∣fied with this sudden Demand with such af∣frighting Menaces, he requested the respite but of one Day only; which being denied, he then Capitulated to have 30 Carts allot∣ted to them, and to be Convoyed with their Arms and Baggage to Waradin; but Corbelli refusing that also, they were con∣ducted to Jeno,Fechede∣bator is surrendred. a place infected with Sick∣ness, and starved with Famine. According∣ly the Turks came forth to the Number of 40 Soldiers, 14 Young Men with Arms in their Hands, with about 80 Women and Young Children, who were all carried to Jeno. In the mean time Corbelli entered the place, and found the Castle in good repair, encompassed on one side with a Ditch full of Water, fortified with Palisadoes, and on the other side with the River Geresch; the which place, tho' in it self small, was yet considerable for its Situation, being seated in a convenient place to cut off all Commu∣nication between Waradin, and the Towns streightned by Blockades; and for that rea∣son Corbelli put a Garrison into it of 200 Hussars under Command of Comloschi a stout and valiant Soldier, and after this Action returned to his Camp. In the mean time Prince Lewis of Baden had discovered that the Design of the Sera∣skier was to avoid a Battle; and that the Report he gave out of his March to Bel∣grade, was only to amuse the Germans, and cause them to draw their Troops on that side, whilst he encamped his Forces near the Banks of the River Morava. Where∣fore the Prince having reinforced the Garri∣son of Belgrade with 2000 Foot,July. Pr. Lewis encamps near the River Mo∣rava. and forti∣fied Semendria, he moved with the whole Body of his Army, and towards the end of July, encamped near the Morava; where Boats being provided, the same Night by help of the Moon, a Bridge was cast over the River, over which 2000 Horse were Commanded to march under the Command of Colonel Strasser,The Turks retreat. to observe the Counte∣nance of the Enemy; who upon the News of the Germans Advance, had made their Retreat. Whereupon Prince Lewis having raised a Fort, and put a Garrison into it of
6000 Men to secure the Bridge, he march∣ed his whole Army on the 2d of August over the same,August. with design to pursue the Enemy, and either force them to a Battel, or to a∣bandon all their Magazines at Nissa. The Turkish Army under the Command of the Seraskier, did not then consist of above 40000 good fighting Men, and disciplin'd Soldiers, the rest were raw and unexperi∣enced Fellows, fit rather to follow the Plough, or Plunder, than to fight a Battle. The Army of Prince Lewis consisted of a∣bout 12000 Germans,The force of both Ar∣mies. and 6000 Hungari∣ans and Hussars, besides some of the Coun∣try People, who were got into a Body in hopes of Booty and Plunder, being anima∣ted thereunto by the Success of the Caesarean Arms. Notwithstanding this great disad∣vantage in Numbers, the Germans being Spirited with Desires of farther Glory, and the meaner sort of them with hopes of Prey and Booty,The Ger∣mans con∣temn their Enemies. and all confiding in a con∣tinual Course and Run of Fortune, boldly proceeded on their March, having the Turks in Contempt, whom they had so often o∣verthrown and defeated. The truth is, the Turks were in a bad Condition both at Home and Abroad;The Grand Vizier goes not to the War. the Grand Vizier himself durst not appear in Person in the Field, least his Enemies at home should suggest Matters to the Sultan in his Absence, which might cost him his Head, or the Loss of his Office: And in∣deed the Army was so inconsiderable this Year, that it seemed beneath the Dignity of a Grand Vizier to appear in the Field, with other than a Royal Army, which was ever reckoned at 100000 Men; to which it was much inferior, and scarce did arise to half the Number. For the Tartar Chan ex∣cused his joyning with the Turkish Army this Year, by reason of the Alarms given them by the Muscovites, who in vast Num∣bers threatned their Country, and were on the Frontiers ready to enter with Fire and Sword. The Militia also of Aleppo, Da∣mascus, Arbekier, and others of the more Eastern Countries of Asia, which always compose a great Nerve of the Ottoman Arms, began to mutiny for want of Money, not being able longer to support and main∣tain themselves: Upon their Remonstrance of which to the Grand Vizier Answer be∣ing returned, That the Royal Treasuries were empty, and exhausted, and that they were obliged by the Constitutions of the Empire, to maintain themselves out of their Timarlucks, or Lands given them for that Service: The Reply was so displeasing, that great Disorder would have follow∣ed, had not the Torrent of the Soldiers Anger been seasonable stopped by paying the Spahee's, or Timars, five Dollars a∣piece, which qualified, and appeased the Mutiny, and Sollevation which was ready to break forth into an open Rebellion.A Mutin prevented in the Turkish Camp. Heisler demolishes Orsoua. Whilst Prince Lewis was on his March, News was brought to him, that Heisler had demolished Orsoua, and retired to some o∣ther Quarters; of which the Turks having received Advice, they entered into it, and having strengthned it with some Palisadoes, they put a Garrison into it. At which Prince Lewis was so displeased, that he sent imme∣diate Orders to that General, that he should forthwith return thither, and endeavour a∣gain to recover the place; and with all pos∣sible speed repair the Fortifications, and con∣serve that Post, as the most convenient Si∣tuation, whereby to transport Victuals and Ammunition, and cut off all the Succours, and Correspondences on that side, by which the Turks might bring in Succours and Re∣lief to Temeswaer, and other places,Counter∣manded by Pr. Lewis. which had been for some time streightned by Blockades. But in regard that General Heisler was much indisposed by Sickness,Heisler sick. and forced to retire to Hermanstadt, for re∣covery of his Health, Orders were given to the General Count Herbeville,Herbevil∣le ordered to recover the place. to exe∣cute that part which was to be acted by Heisler, and accordingly having dispatched Sempsai with his Hussars in the Van, it was his Fortune to encounter a Party of Turks, from whom he carried 30 Heads, made 25 Prisoners, and took three Colours. The General following with the rest of the Ar∣my, and being come near to Orsoua, ano∣ther Party of Turks appeared, which had newly passed from the other side of the Da∣nube in small Boats; and these being At∣tacked by Herbeville, between the Fortress and the River, the whole Body was in a moment either cut to pieces, or Drowned,He defeats a Party of Turks, or made Prisoners; of which 50 Horse were taken, and one Standard. After which the gross Body of the Im∣perial Army being advanced under the For∣tress, the place was observed to be well for∣tified; and on the other side of the River they discovered an Army in their Trenches, well defended and guarded with Cannon; and on the Shoar side many well armed Gal∣lies, and 100 Vessels laden with all sorts of Ammunition and Provisions; the which, according to Report, was said to be the Ar∣my of Tekely joyned to the Forces of the Pasha of Silistria, and another Pasha. Howsoever the General being desirous to make trial of his Fortune, advanced with his Forces near the place, and hav∣ing posted themselves under shelter of Banks and Sacks of Earth, to take a view of the Enemies State and Conditi∣on,And Pe∣tires from Orsoua. they were so warmly receiv'd by their Cannon and Granadoes, that they were
forced to retire towards Caransebes; and at the same time News came that Tekely had killed 100 Rascians, and taken some Boats with the Hussars which were in them, and advanced with resolution to carry Suc∣cours and Relief into Temeswaer. In the mean time Prince Lewis was on his March towards Nissa, but finding the way very bad, and difficult by reason of the thick Woods, and Marshy Grounds, and much Rain, so that it was almost impossible to draw their Cannon and Waggons laden with Provisions, which began already to be wanting, it was resolved to retire to Semen∣dria. And here it was that Prince Lewis altered the Course of his March; and being come into the Parts of Ressava,August 27th and 28th. the Foot advan∣ced a Day before, and the Horse following them the next, they joyned at Gabrovitz, where a Survey being taken of the Situa∣tion of the Place along the Banks of Mora∣va, by several Engeniers, and particularly by Count Marsigli,A Bridge made over the Mo∣rava. they fixed on a place the most commodious for casting a Bridge over the River, which was effected in a few Hours, and the same secured with 16 pieces of Cannon, mounted on a Redoubt which they newly raised, and defended by 500 Men. The Germans having passed all their For∣ces over the River, a strong Detachment of the Enemy appeared, and surprized the Centinels and Out-guards, of which the Tartars killed some, and pursued the others, until the Imperial Troops, (who were al∣ways ready upon the first Alarm) gave a stop to the Career of the Tartars, of which they killed some, and took two Prisoners; from whom they received intelligence, that a great Body of Turks and Tartars under Command of Sultan Galga, Son of the Chan of Tartary, had passed the Morava near Jagodina, with design to attack the Germans on that side of the River near Pas∣sarovitz. And moreover that the Seraskier was on his March with an Army of 50000 Men towards Passarovitz and Semendria, with design so to environ the Imperial Army on all sides,The Designs of the Turks. as to cut off the Provisions from coming to their Camp; the which Resolution was formed upon the Report of some French Fugitives, who had deserted and fled to the Turks; and given them in∣telligence, that the Germans were in great want of Provisions, which was the cause of their Retreat to Semendria. Prince Lewis being well assured, that he was able to march securely to Passarovitz, notwithstanding a Thousand Difficulties which were presented before him;Pr. Lewis resolves to Attack the Seraskier. and tho' a Body of Turks and Tartars were not far distant, and the whole Army of the Sera∣skier encamped not above an Hour and halfs March from the Christian Forces; yet trust∣ing to the good Conduct of his General, and the Bravery and Courage of his Soldi∣ers, he resolved to dislodge the Camp of the Seraskier, and thereby open a free Com∣munication between the Palanca of Hassan Pasha and Semendria, whereby the Maga∣zines would be maintained, and the Repu∣tation of the Imperial Arms supported. Hereupon on the 29th of August by Break of Day in the Morning,His March. the Prince com∣manded two Regiments of Dragoons, with all the Quarter-Masters, and Foragers, and a Party of 500 Horse to ascend the ri∣sing of a Hill not far distant from the Bridge, to cover and secure the March of the Foot, which were sent before under Command of General Heisler, and Count Guido of Staremberg, who were appointed to secure the Baggage in passing the River Ressava: And at the same time the Prince himself, with his Cavalry, advanced to∣wards the River, keeping the rising Hill on his right Hand, and the Plain to Ressava on his left; marching always in a Line, the better to withstand the Enemies Horse, which ran on all Quarters to find out where they might best annoy and break in upon them. And here it was that Prince Lewis very wisely, and with much Policy com∣manded the Horsemen to dismount, as if they intended to lodge there, for securing their Baggage: But in regard the sole De∣sign of the Prince was to fight the Enemy, and drive them to the other side of the Ri∣ver, he commanded Colonel St. Croix with some Hundreds of choice German Horse, and the Generals Cziacchy, Diach,He advan∣ces towards the Turks. and Badiani a Captain of Strigonium, with their Hunga∣rians, privately to pass the River, and with their Hussars to hide themselves amongst some Woods and Bushes in a certain Valley, opposite to the Horse; upon which Vetera∣ni, and Piccolomini, and the Hussars, advan∣ced in full Career against the Enemy, whilst the Prince, with the rest of his Cavalry, followed upon an easie Gallop. At the first the Turks did not believe that the Design of the Prince was to advance so far upon them, or to force them to a Battle; and therefore they retired very easily with their Tartars, keeping a Reserve of 12000 Horse, with 500 Janizaries mounted be∣hind, which they embosked in a Wood to attack Veterani and Piccolomini, which they looked upon only as a handful of Men: But so soon as they discovered the whole right Wing moving through the Plains under Ve∣terani, and the left commanded by Piccolo∣mini; and the Prince following with the main Body of the Army, directly march∣ing, and pouring upon them, they made
more haste in their Retreat than before, and being attacked on all sides, both from the Hills, Mountains, and Vallies, they made a hasty March away for the space of four Hours; but being closely pursued to a nar∣row Pass, where they were forced to make a Stand, they were so furiously assailed by the Troops of Veterani, and afterwards se∣conded by those of the Prince, that in a short time they were defeated, and dispers∣ed in the Woods;The Turks defeated. in which being pursued, and hunted for the space of an Hour and a half into the Plains on the other side; the Turks were so beaten, that above 400 of their best Horse, both Turks and Tartars were killed, and many Prisoners taken, a∣mongst which was the Commander in chief of the 500 Janizaries, with 12 Standards and Timbals which are the Musick of Pa∣sha's. In this Confusion many of the Turks for∣sook their Horses, and betook themselves to their Heels through Bushes and Thickets, and the adjacent Hills and Mountains; but being pursued by the Heydukes and Hussars, who were acquainted with the private and secret Ways and Conveyances of the Coun∣try, many of them were killed and taken: Others of them, who to make themselves more light for Escape, threw away their Arms, and whatsoever else might incumber them in their Flight; so that all the Ways were strowed with Lances, Turbants, Boots, Caps, Cloaths, Vests and Arms, all which became a welcome Booty and Spoil to the Victorious Soldiery. This Success so encouraged the Germans, that Prince Lewis to improve this Advan∣tage to an entire Victory, resolved to de∣feat and thwart the Designs of the Son of the Tartar Chan, (who lay encamped on the other side of the River) by falling upon him before he could come to joyn with the Turkish Cavalry lately beaten: And tho' the Imperial Horse were much ti∣red and harassed with the Fatigue of that Days Action, he returned notwithstanding to the Bridge, where after three Hours March, about seven a Clock in the Evening he arrived. The Cavalry being here refreshed, and set up for a while, the Prince went in er∣son to visit the Infantry, which he found well encamped out of all danger, and every thing perfectly well disposed, and in good order by the Care and Conduct of those two brave Generals, Veterani and Piccolo∣mini. After which some Scouts were sent to dis∣cover the Ways, and observe the Ground on that side;Consultati∣ons to As∣sault the Enemy. upon whose Report that there was only a very narrow passage through a rough and thick Wood, about half an Hours March in length, by which there was an Entrance into a small Plain, which if the Enemy should possess, they might easily defend the Pass, and make an Attack on the Tartars difficult and hazardous. Prince Lewis and the Generals, being well assured hereof, detached Count Solaro with 500 Men to secure the Passage into the Plain, but the Enemy having intimation thereof, with 3000 Janizaries, and a good Body of Horse, not only gave a stop to his March, but caused him to retire with the loss of se∣veral Men: But General Heisler coming sea∣sonably in to their succour, so advantage∣ously posted himself within the Woods and thick Bushes, that he maintained the Pass, until such time (which was next Morning by Break of Day) that Prince Lewis com∣ing on with his main force in a thick Fogg, posted himself before the Wood, being sheltered on the right Hand by Thickets and Bushy Grounds, almost unpassable, extend∣ing his left Wing to the side of the Morava; and being thus advantageously drawn up, immediate Orders were dispatched to the Cavalry,The Turks attack the Christi∣ans, which were refreshing themselves at the Bridge, to hasten unto the Foot; but before they could come up, the Fog clear∣ing away, unexpectedly the whole Body of the Turkish Army appeared (the most part consisting of Moors and Arabs) drawn up in order of Battle, just fronting the Imperial Infantry, which the Turks assailed with such unusual Fury, and sudden Violence, that Prince Lewis had scarce time to draw up his second Line into a posture of defence. The Imperialists howsoever stood the Shock with great firmness and constancy, and re∣ceived the Fire both of their great and small Shot; and tho' the Chevaux de Freeze, were of great use to them at this, as on other occasions, yet many of the German Foot were at that time cut to pieces by the Turkish Scimetars. And now the Fight became very hot on both sides, and continued so for the space of two Hours within Pistol-shot, by which time General Count Casselli being come up with his Cavalry, and sounding without the Wood with his Trumpets, Hautboys, and Kettle-Drums, the Enemy were put into such a Fear and Consternation, that they began to retreat into the neighbouring Wood; by which Prince Lewis having gain∣ed both Time and Ground, drew up his Horse behind the Foot;Are beaten & retreat. and whilst he re∣mained in this posture, a Bavarian Soldier, (who had been taken Prisoner at the Siege of Buda) having made his Escape, came and reported, that the Enemy was retired to another Plain behind the Wood; where for their better security, they had thrown up some Earth, and made new Trenches:
Upon this Intelligence the Generals were in great hopes of gaining an entire Victory, if they could handsomely come to Charge the Enemy in the Flank; to perform which they designed to open a passage by their Mus∣queteers; but it seems there was no need of so much Labour: for Count Guido of Staremberg being commanded to advance be∣fore with a Party to discover the Counte∣nance and Disposition of the Enemy, he found a way sufficiently open and wide for a March, and not above 500 paces to the Plain, where the Enemy was retired not far behind their Trenches. They quit their ground.Upon this News the Prince immediately detached 300 Horse, and a Battallion of his own Regiment, and another of Count Stras∣ser's under Command of that Count, to seize that Post, which succeeded so happily, that the Turks upon their first appearance, cowardly abandoned the place, and fled; which the Imperialists possessed, whilst a∣nother party of Foot came in to their Assi∣stance; and then the Cannon on both sides fired with mutual damage, the which con∣tinued for the space of an Hour and half; during which time several German Soldiers were killed and wounded,Some Ger∣man Sol∣diers kill'd. as also four Cap∣tains killed, besides Lieutenants and Sub∣altern Officers who were wounded. And here it was thought fit to take Breath a while, and enter into Consultati∣on, whether it were adviseable to prosecute the Victory farther, or not, and pursue the Enemy, who had again posted themselves with more advantage in another Trench a∣bout 3 or 400 Paces behind the former, and which was much stronger, being encompas∣sed with a deep Ditch of Water, and only accessible in one place, which the Turks con∣tinued to fortifie without any fear or appre∣hension of danger. Another Attack on the Turks.Upon due consideration of the strength of the place, and the Difficulties of an At∣tack, it was concluded that an Attempt was to be hazarded, and that with all expediti∣on, and without loss of time: Accordingly the Prince ordered that the first Trench should be levelled for the more easie passage of the Horse; and that Count Piccolomini (to whom the Command of the Van-guard was that Day committed) should advance with some Regiments of Horse, and some Battalions of Foot, and put himself into Battalia before the Trench; and Count Palfi with his Regiment of Heydukes, was or∣dered to take the left Hand by way of the Wood, and to sound all his Drums, and Hautboys, and other Instruments, making the greatest noise he was able in the Wood, and to give an Alarm, as if some great Body were in motion, to Attack them in the Rear, which would serve to put them into greater Consternation and Dis∣order. Matters being thus wisely ordered, Pic∣colomini began to advance in Battalia, and the Enemy endeavoured to repulse him with their Cannon; but when they obser∣ved that the Germans without fear of their Fire, advanced still resolutely upon them, and gained ground;The Turks fly to Pa∣toschin. and that the Heydukes came on desperately to the left; so fearing to be engaged in the midst, they abandoned this their last advantageous Post, and with great Disorder marched through thick Woods to their Camp at Patoschin. This Cowardly Flight of the Turks inspi∣red new Courage into the Christians to pur∣sue them to their ultimate Retirement; which they had done to the entire Destru∣ction of the Enemy, but that the Way was so narrow, that they were forced to break their Ranks, and march one after the other, which lost much time, and gave the Turks means to escape, and the Janizaries having Horses ready Sadled, notably advanced in their Flight; but Baron Zant having Or∣ders to pursue the Rear-Guard of the Ene∣my, being joyned with the Regiments of Sarau, and Kisel, they overtook many of them in the Woods, and pursued the rest to their very Camp; after which, these Co∣lonels not having Orders to follow the E∣nemy farther, who were 25000 strong, be∣sides those which straggled in the Woods, they betook themselves to the rising of a Hill, where they halted until Prince Lewis came up to them with the gross Body of his Cavalry, and then the Turks fled with Disorder and Precipitation, as the Germans pursued with greater Heat and Courage; and had not the Woods been thick, and the Germans ignorant of the Ways and Passages, they had made a most terrible Slaughter, to the entire Defeat and Destruction of the Turkish Army. Howsoever Prince Lewis continued the Pursuit with some Parties of Horse, under the Command of Colonel Zant; who gave so frightful an Alarm to the Turks,They aban∣don their Camp. that forsaking their Camp with Fear and Consternation, they left all their Cannon, Ammunition, and Provisions to the Disposal of the Enemy. In the Camp they found 105. pieces of Brass Cannon, and three Mortars, with great Numbers of Bombs, Granadoes, Pow∣der, and all sorts of Warlike Ammunition, and Provisions, with their Camels, Oxen, Buffalo's, and Tents;The Ger∣mans pos∣sess it. and in short all their Baggage became a Prey to the Victorious Germans, whilst the timorous Turks fled in much Confusion towards Jagodina and Kra∣kolovetz; and many of them were taken up on the Way by the Hungarians, Hussars and Rascians.
Great was the Joy of the Generals and Soldiers for so signal a Victory, and having lodged one Night in the Enemies Camp, with much Pleasure and Festivity, the Day following early in the Morning they sang Praises to God for his Mercy and Blessings of Victory;Return Thanks to God. and as a signal of Triumph, made the Camp to resound with three Vol∣lies of Shot, with Drums, Trumpets, Tim∣bals, and all sorts of Warlike Musick. After Thanks were returned to Almighty God, who is the God of Hosts, and Giver of Victory; the Imperial Generals thought it reasonable and necessary to give some re∣pose and rest to the wearied Troops; and to augment their Commons and Refresh∣ments, Orders were given to the Commis∣saries to distribute amongst the Army the Provisions found in the Enemies Stores: In the mean time the Hussars and Hungarians, who had pursued the Enemy for some Days, returned the 3d of September to the Camp,Septemb. bringing some Colours, and many Prisoners with them, together with 36 pieces of Can∣non of the largest size. And thus the Victory being compleat, Prince Lewis permitted the Courier, whom the Turkish Ambassadors had dis-speeded from Vienna to Constantinople, to proceed; he had been detained for some Weeks at Semendria, so that now besides the Dispatch from the Ambassadors, he carried another from Prince Lewis to the Grand Vizier, giving him to understand,Pr. Lewis Writes to the Vizier. that the Imperial Armies ha∣ving advanced so far within the Bowels of the Ottoman Dominions, he would now pro∣ceed forward to meet him, and save him the trouble of a tedious March; but in case his Company, and coming should be unwel∣come and displeasing to the Sultan, they might thank themselves for the trouble of such unacceptable Guests; which might have been avoided, had they hearkened to the Propositions which His Imperial Maje∣sty and His Allies made to them for a Peace, which they having unadvisedly rejected, had brought upon themselves all those Mis∣fortunes which had attended them in every Action of this last Campaign. In the mean time the Blockades of Cani∣sia and Great Waradine, were daily more streightned,Blackades of Canisia and Great Waradine continued. and all the Corn and Grass burned up in those parts which were neigh∣bouring to those Cities; and tho' they suf∣fered much Want and Penury of all things, and had received the unwelcome News of several Defeats given to the Turks; yet supporting and comforting their Spirits with hopes that a Peace would speedily in∣sue, at least in the Winter Season, they resol∣ved not to surrender until the last Extre∣mity. Prince Lewis having refreshed his Forces with several Days of rest, and plenty of Provisions taken from the Enemy, and re∣inforced his Army with some Troops com∣ing from Belgrade, he prepared for a new Enterprize,Pr. Lewis marches to Nissa. and began his March towards Nissa, about 20 Leagues distant from the Camp at Patoschin, the most part of the way Woody and Mountainous; but no∣thing was now difficult, or insuperable to the exalted Courage of the Germans. The Turks on the other side, tho' somewhat a∣based and mortified, yet supported them∣selves with the Comfort, That tho' they had lost their Camp, with their Cannon, Tents, and Baggage, yet most of their Ar∣my was still in being; That the Tartars had beaten the Muscovites; That the Troubles in Asia were pacified, and the Discontents in Albania wtih Mamut Ogli Bey, compo∣sed. Moreover a Reinforcement of 20000 Men were sent to the Seraskier, with new Tents, and all the necessary Appurtenan∣ces for War; and likewise it was reported abroad, That the Grand Vizier would come himself in person, and in despight of the preceding Misfortunes, would yet put an Honourable end to this Campaign. Prince Lewis little regarding the Talk, and the Reports with which the Turks com∣forted themselves, committing the charge of Patoschin to a Sergeant Major, with 100 Horse to cover the Artillery, and to guard them on their Way to Semendria, he dis-speeded some Hungarians and Rascians to take a Survey of the Country, and of the State of the Turks Affairs; who according∣ly coasting the Country, brought News, that the Turks were not only fled out of all those parts, but had likewise abandoned Nissa, having for their easier passage built a Bridge over a Marshy Ground near that Town.Pr. Lewis marches towards Nissa. Whereupon the Prince having fix∣ed his Boats on Wheels, Convoyed by a Party of 500 Horse, he took his March with the whole Army on the 11th of Sep∣tember, and arrived that Night at Jagodina, after a hard March through Woods and Marshes; and to make a passage for the Boats which were designed to make a Bridge over the Morava, a new Way was made through the Woods, where being arrived, they happily met some other Boats from Passarovitz, with some quantities of Flour, which came seasonably for relief of the Army. At Jagodina News was brought that the Turks had quitted Nissa; whereupon Prince Lewis detached 50 Heydukes of Palfi's Re∣giments,Bridges broken and others made. and 10 Dragoons on Foot to Crus∣savetz, to break down the Bridge there, and conserve that Post; and for passage of the Army at a more convenient place, another Bridge was made with Boats, and to cover
it Colonel Strasser with 2000 Men, made a Redoubt on the other side of the Ri∣ver. And here so great was the Mortality of Men and Horse, and want of Forage, that it seemed almost impossible to advance far∣ther; but News being brought, that the Turks were in great Consternation in their Camp, and that the Soldiers deserted by Hundreds every Day; and the Dukes of Croy, and Holstein coming about that time to the Camp with some Recruits, animated Prince Lewis to come to one Battle more with the Seraskier; and having raised two Forts at the Bridge, he passed over with his Horse on the 16th, and the Day follow∣ing with his Foot. The Turks had just then received a Recruit of 10000 Men, and strongly intrenched themselves by the side of the River near Nissa. The Prince being ill provided with Victu∣als in his Camp, had no time to lose, and therefore marched so fast, that on the 22th of September, he pitched his Camp within a League distant from Nissa, near a little Stream which falls into the Nissava; from whence he took a prospect of the Counte∣nance and Situation of the Enemy, and their Camp; and having observed every thing, and in what place the Enemy might most commodiously be Attacked; on the 23th they marched forward in a close, and well ordered Battalia; but nothing happened that Day besides some small Skirmishes of little importance; but that Night before the Even∣ing was quite shut in, the Prince made as if he intended to make a Bridge over the Ri∣var to pass to the Tartars, who were posted on the other side;Septemb. 24. but in the Morning he took another Method, possessing himself of the sides of the Hills, over the Enemies Camp;Pr. Lewis engages the Turks near Nissa. which when the Turks discovered, they detached a Party to engage with them, and with 2 or 3000 Turks and Tartars, they attacked the Rear-Guard of the Right Wing, by which Count Veterani was forced to keep a little behind with the two Regiments of Hanover and St. Croix, which formed the second Line of that Wing, and were ap∣pointed to guard and cover the Baggage, which was always placed in the Rear of the Army: This slow motion of the Cannon and Baggage, which could not be avoided, retarded the motion of the advanced Troops, which ever and anon made a Halt, so that it was five a Clock in the Evening before they could reach the Foot of the Hill, where both Armies came in sight of each other. And because it might rationally be con∣jectured, that the Turks would before the Morning, fortifie their Camp with some Trenches, and Parapets of Earth; the Prince resolved without giving them so much time, to advance upon them with all the Courage and Fury imaginable; extending his right Wing towards the Foot of the Hill, and his left along the Plain to the Banks of the Ri∣ver Nissava; which being orderly disposed, resolutely Attacked the Enemy,Pr. Lewis Attacks the Turks. according to the Methods and Measures design'd. The Turks with their accustomed Cry of Allah, Allah, caused the greatest part of their Cavalry which was drawn up on the declivity of the Hill, to charge the Infan∣try of the left Wing, Commanded by Count Guido of Staremberg, and the Regiments of Kisel and Sarau; which when the Prince observed, he caused some Cannon to be brought on that side; with which, and a Detachment from these Regiments, the whole left Wing advanced towards the Ene∣my; the Turks seeing this, retired with their Body of Horse, and wheeled about towards the right Wing, and Attacked them at the Foot of the Hill on the Flank, which could not well be secured; which produced some Fear and Confusion amongst the Hus∣sars, but being succoured by the Regiments of Holstein, and Noircharmes, which Picco∣lomini Commanded, and by a Party of brave Hungarians,The Turk∣ish Horse in disorder. they so disordered the Turkish Horse, that they had been put to an open Flight, had they not been stopt in their Career by some of their own Troops, who met them and Fired upon them: By this Accident the Enemy still maintaining their Ground on the side of the Hill towards the right Wing of the Germans, gave opportu∣nity and time to the Cavalry to rally again in the Plains: But Prince Lewis incessantly riding and giving Orders in all places of the Army, commanded the main Body, which was directed by Baron Heisler, to Attack the Turks on the Hill, which they perform∣ed so effectually, that after a long Conflict, they gained the top of the Hill; and then drawing all the Battalions into an equal Line, both the right Wing and the Baggage were both secured from the Attempt of the Enemy. On the other side the Duke of Croy,Duke of Croy suc∣cours the right Wing who commanded towards the River, being ad∣vised by the Prince, that the right Wing was distressed, and hardly beset by the E∣nemy, he presently resolved to advance to the top of the Hill in a direct Line towards their Succour, to give a greater Diversion to the Enemy, and to gain the top of the Hill; the which being effected, the Situa∣tion thereof proved so advantageous a Post, that in a short time they drove the Enemy from thence with a considerable Slaughter. Notwithstanding which, the Turkish Horse rallying again in the Plains, made another Vigorous Assault on the left Wing, but
were received by them with so much Bra∣very and Resolution, that they were once more on their Flight, when the Janizaries who were making new Trenches, Fired up∣on them, and forced them to stand another Charge; which they steadily performed, and with great Vigour against the Hussars, but they being succoured by the Regiment of Caprara, forced the Enemy entirely to quit the Field, and pursued them with great Fury to their very Camp. Whilst the left Wing had thus gloriously acquitted themselves, another Party of the Enemies Horse Attacked them in the mid∣dle of their Body, but being succoured by Count Guido de Staremberg, with some Bat∣tallions of his own Regiment, and of the Heydukes of Palfi, they discharged such terrible Vollies upon them, that great Num∣bers of the Turks fell Dead on the Ground; and the others so cowed and affrighted, that losing all hopes of Conquest,The Turks put to Flight. when they saw their Trenches possessed by the Prince, and shut up on all sides by the right Wing, they betook themselves in good earnest, to a confused and disorderly Flight; and tho' the Night came on, yet the Victorious Germans pursued the Turks so long, as they could have the least glimpse or appearance of the Enemy; so that many of them to avoid the Sword, threw themselves head∣long into the Nissava; where by the depth of the Water, and rapidness of the River, they miserably perished. And here, as well as during the whole course of the Battle, the two Brothers Charles and August Prin∣ces of Hanover, with their Regiments, be∣haved themselves with great Bravery; and in the heat of the Action, could scarce be withheld from following the Enemy into the Water; but only by the Perswasions and Injunctions of General Veterani, they gave a stop to the Pursuit. Thus the Night put an end to the Victo∣ry, and the Slaughter of the Turks, who a∣bandoned the City tho' fortified with a good Ditch, and some Palisadoes, after the Turk∣ish manner,The Chri∣stians gain an en∣tire Victory tho' irregularly planted; the same Night Prince Lewis put into the Town, several Battalions to conserve it from being burnt, as the Turks intended to have done. In the Morning Provisions and Forage were found sufficient to subsist the Army for three Weeks. In short, all the Cannon being 30 pieces for Battery, became a Prey to the Germans, as also many Thousands of very fine Tents, (amongst which was that of the Seraskier, which the Grand Seignior had lately sent him) with divers Standards, par∣ticularly that of Mamoot Ogli Pasha of Al∣bania. The Horse-Tayls were also taken. Numbers sin.The Numbers slain on the Enemies side, with those Drowned, were computed to be 10000, amongst which were 3000 Spa∣hee's, whose Horses and Mules, with rich Furniture and good Lading were brought to the Camp, where for that Night it re∣mained, and next Morning was distributed amongst the Imperial Cavalry. This Victory was so much the more Glorious and Wonderful for having been atchieved by 15000 Germans tired and ha∣rassed by Marches, Countermarches, Skir∣mishes and Battles, as before related, a∣gainst 80000 Turks;The Victory wonderful. and what is still more miraculous, there was not on the Christian side above 300 killed and wounded, and none of any considerable Quality, besides the Sergeant-Major of the Regiment of Stirum, and Count Vellen, the which great Success is entirely to be attributed to the Almighty Hand of the God of Ar∣mies. This second Victory being in this man∣ner obtained against the Seraskier on the 24th of September, the whole Army conti∣nued in Arms all that Night; and in the Morning Quarters were regularly set out for the Soldiers within the City of Nissa;The Chri∣stians en∣ter Nissa. and on the 26th all things being setled in good order, Te Deum was solemnly sung in the Seraskier's Tent, with three Salvoes of all the Cannon, and Vollies of Muskets re∣turning Thanks to Almighty God, for this Wonderful Victory, which none but the Powerful Arm of the God of Hosts was a∣ble to bestow. Afterward Prince Lewis having visited the City, observed that it was fortified only with a single Ditch and some Palisadoes; howsoever it was judged very convenient for Winter Quarters,It is fort¦fied for Winter Quarters. and therefore ordered that it should be something better fortified, by the Work of 2000 Foot, which were drawn out of several Regiments to labour on the Fortifications, which in a short time was brought to that condition, as to render it capable of being the head Quarters for the whole Winter, where Provisions were accordingly laid up in Store-houses for Sub∣sistence of the whole Army. And to disco∣ver the Countenance and Condition of the Enemy, Count Piccolomini gave Orders to Detach a Party of 1000 Horse to enter far∣ther into the Country, to view and observe the Quality and Situation of all places, as far as Sophia, and to possess all the Passes which the Enemy had abandoned. This Party being returned, brought News to the General, that tho' they had proceeded above half the way towards Sophia, they had not met, or seen, so much as one Turk on the Road, having found divers Places and Castles without People, and Deserted; amongst which,Musta∣pha Pasha Palanca. was Mustapha Pasha Palanca, a Fortress, as
I remember, raised by a Pasha of that Name, to cover a Caravasarei, for Tra∣vellers to Lodge with their Horses and Goods in security, from the frequent At∣tempts of Thieves and Robbers, which in that desolate Country gained great Spoils and Booty; and that they might be better protected, a Garrison was put into it of 60 Men; for maintenance of which, this Pasha had given a Revenue sufficient for it's Subsistance: And in this place I slept one Night as I remember, without any Care or Fears. From this place a small Party of Ger∣mans and Hungarians were sent as far as Dragoman,A Party of the Ger∣mans near Sophia. about four hours Journey from Sophia; which gave such an Alarm all the way, that the Turks every where forsook their Dwellings, and so affrighted the In∣habitants, that hundreds of them ran to the Mountains, but suddenly returned, so soon as it was known, that the Party was small which gave the Alarm. Howsoever, the Consternation was so great, that the Soldiers contrary to the Commands given to make their Rendezvous at Sophia, fear∣fully deserted, and fled to their own Dwel∣lings. The News of this Defeat was first brought from Sophia to Constantinople, on the first of October,October. by one called Mustapha Aga, whom Zulfigar the Turkish Ambassa∣dor at Vienna had freed from Captivity, and afterwards dispatched him with some Letters to the Ottoman Port; but on his way, Prince Lewis had stopped him for some Months at Semendria, until the last Victory was obtained against the Turks; after which, he discharged, and suffered him to proceed, to carry his stale Packets from the Ambassadors, and fresher News from the Turkish Army, which was now entirely defeated, and dispersed in the most shameful manner that ever was re∣counted in any History. The News hereof struck all the Otto∣man Court with confused Consternation,The Turkish Court in great Con∣fusion. none knowing what to say, or what to Counsel, much less to Act; but all wished that the Measures and Resolutions taken at Sophia, by the Grand Vizier, presently after the Battle of Patoschin, had been put in Execution, whereby the last defeat be∣fore Nissa had been avoided, and an end put to the War with more Honour and Advantage than could now be expected. For the Grand Visier had on the 17th of September, a thing not usual, Convened a General Council at Sophia,A General Council of the Turks called at Sophia. of all the Grand Officers and Ministers of the Empire; such as the Nakib Effendi, who is the Chief of the Green-Heads, or those of the Kindred of Mahomet, the Mufti, the two Kadileskers or Chief Justices of Ro∣melia and Anatolia, the Generals of the Spahees and Janizaries, with many other principal Officers of the Army, and Ci∣vil Government. At which Council, the Proposals for a Peace made by the Empe∣ror and his Allies were publickly Read, and with much Attention hearkned unto by this Grand Assembly; which though judged in the Opinion of all there pre∣sent, to be very severe and dishonourable, and unknown before to their mighty Em∣pire, which was used in former times to give rather than to receive Conditions of Peace; yet considering the present un∣happy posture of Affairs; it was unani∣mously concluded by them, to Embrace the Offers made, least God who had pu∣nished them for the Violation of their last Truce or Peace, should punish them yet farther, if they should refuse to ac∣cept the Conditions now proposed to re∣scue them from Destruction. The Articles being drawn up in Paper, were presented to the Grand Signior for his Approbation, who having Read them, gave Answer,The Grand Seignior consents to a Peace. That he desired to return to his Throne at Constantinople in Peace: And having signed them, they were com∣mitted to Mustapha Aga to carry them to Vienna; for which Journey he had re∣ceived 3000 Hungarian Ducats from the Treasurer. The Articles were as follow, inclosed in a Letter to Zulfigar Aga, one of the Turkish Ambassadors in the Castle of Puttendorf. Offers of Peace by the Turks. I. THat he should use his utmost Endea∣vours to Conclude a Peace, so much desired by all the People; who notwith∣standing the many Arguments, Allure∣ments, and fair Promises of the French to the contrary, would not trust to that Na∣tion, which had been false to them in all Ages, and now also endeavoured to en∣tertain them with a thousand false Hopes. II. That he should labour by all means possible to perswade the Emperor to quit Belgrade, and to make that place the Li∣mit of their Dominions; and the Save to Terminate the Frontier on both sides. And if any scruple or difference should arise thereupon, that then in lieu thereof he should offer Canisia, or if that should be taken, then to propose Giula, Temes∣waer, or Great Waradin.
III. As to the Polanders; to Content them, a Proposal should be made to de∣molish Kaminiec; and if that would not satisfie them, that it should be surren∣dred. Lastly, As to the Venetians, They should Enjoy and Keep all that they had taken; and that no mention should be made of Negropont. Now whilst Mustapha Aga was ready to depart with these Articles, the unhappy News was brought to the Grand Visier,The News of a defeat given the Turks hinders the Peace. That the Turks had received a total defeat before Nissa, with the slaughter of many thousands of Turks, and with the loss of all their Cannon and Ammunition, toge∣ther with the City of Nissa it self: And that the Vizier Kaja, or Deputy, with the Treasurer of the Army, had made his Escape out of the Battle to Sophia with great difficulty; and that the remainder of the scattered Army went wandring through the Woods and Mountains; it not being known as yet, who was killed, or taken, or alive. So soon as this Report was made known to the Grand Vizier, he immediately posted the same by the Messenger who brought it, to the Grand Seignior, then at Adrianople; and all the way he Rode, he gave Orders in all Places to raise the Ne∣firan, or the Trained-Bands of the Coun∣tries, by which all things were in such Consternation, as if the Germans had been at the very Gates of Sophia. This Change of Affairs gave a stop to the Expedition of Mustapha Aga, until new Resolutions should be taken by another Divan, or some other Assembly of Coun∣cil; the which being again met, they con∣firmed the former Resolution, and dis∣patched away Mustapha Aga, with the former Propositions of Peace;The Am∣bassador proceeds to Vienna. And an Ex∣press was dispatched before him from So∣phia, to obtain from Prince Lewis, a Pass∣port and Safe-Conduct unto Vienna: The Prince readily granted, and ordered him a Party of 25 Horse to Convoy him safely so far as Pyroth. And here Prince Lewis gave a period to the Proceedings of this year's Campagne:The Cam∣pagne ended. For considering, that the Season was entirely spent, the distance far from the Danube, the Difficulties of so long a Communication, and the uncer∣tainty of subsisting the Army in the Ene∣mies Country already wasted, and ruinous, he thereupon judged it most secure to re∣turn back to the Danube; and accordingly marched away on the 4th of October, ha∣ving committed the Government of Nissa, and of the Conquered Countries, to the Care and Conduct of Count Piccolomini, with some Regiments of Horse and Foot, and some Rascians under Paul Dioh, pla∣cing a good guard on the Mountain He∣mus. But because the Prince was very de∣sirous to defeat Count Tekeli,Designs to surprize Tekeli. the great Partisan of France, who was encamped near to Widin, he judged it of great im∣portance to fall into his Quarters on his way to the Danube; and accordingly on the 6th of October, he encamped near the Castle Saverlick; and the next day he Quartered at the foot of the Mountain of Temach, which he passed on the 8th, through so narrow a streight, that a single Cart could scarce pass; and moreover, the ways were so very rocky and incommo∣dious, that the Baggage was greatly re∣tarded; wherefore the Prince commanded some German and Hungarian Troops to advance towards Widin, and on the way by such Prisoners as they should take, to inform themselves of the State of Widin, and of the Enemies Camp. These Troops had not been on their way above two hours, before they returned with two Turkish Prisoners, who informed them, That Orsoua and Fetislau had been burnt on the first of this Month,Orsoua and Feti∣slau burnt. and abando∣ned by the Enemy; And because they feared, that some sudden Attack would be made upon them by the Germans, they had carried away from Widin all the Pro∣visions of that place, and were gone far∣ther by Water into the more distant Places of their Country; And that about 2000 Turks, and others of Tekeli's Troops were encamped near the River to cover the Boats on which their Baggage was to be laden; and that their Camp consisted of about 200 Tents: So Prince Lewis lodged that Night in the Country and Plains of Bergfelt. Upon these Advices, next Morning by break of Day, being the 13th of October, the Army then with the Prince, consisting but of some few Regiments, proceeded on their march towards Widin, designing to arrive at the place early next day; and because the Hungarians returned with the News, that the Enemy quartered near the City with all security, not suspecting the approach of the Germans, having refreshed their Horse for some few Hours near Dre∣noua, they marched all that Night, and came about 11 a Clock in the Morning within sight of Widin,Pr. Lewis marches to Widin. where they first discovered the Camp of the Enemy; and having taken a view of the situation of the place, and the several Avenues there∣unto, they found that they must necessa∣rily pass Three Bridges, or take a round
through some marshy Grounds, which perhaps were unpassable, at least very ha∣zardous,The Horse pass the Bridges and enter the Ene∣mies Camp. without a faithful Guide or Pi∣lot. Wherefore taking the opportunity, when the Janizaries and People were in the Mosch at Prayers, they caused the Horse to pass the Bridges, which having done without any Opposition, they trot∣ted directly to the Enemies Tents, and entered into them about Three a Clock in the Afternoon: This unexpected Enter∣prize so alarm'd the Turks, that part of them, with affrighted Precipitation, be∣took themselves to the Boats, and others mounting on Horseback, drew out with the Janizaries, to the number of 12000, ranging themselves in posture of Battle. Prince Lewis (advancing with some of his light Cannon in the Front) committed the Conduct of the Right Wing to Count Veterani and Trautmansdorf;The Turks make a stand b∣fore Wi∣din. and the Left he commanded in Person, with which some Countermarches were made to spend time until the Infantry could come up, gaining still some ground upon the Enemy. How∣soever, the Turks made a stand, and fought with such Resolution, that the Victory seemed dubious for a while; but the Dra∣goons of Veterani dismounting, which were used to do Miracles, threw them∣selves with their Swords drawn into the Ditch of the Town, killing and slaying all that came in their way; which, when the Turkish Infantry observed, part of them came to their assistance; but the Right Wing, Commanded by the Prince, soon relieved them, and came thundring on them with such furious Resolution,The Turkish Cavalry put to flight and the Army de∣feated, and Widin taken. that they put all to the Sword, excepting those who were retired into the Castle, or made their escape by Water: The greatest part of the Turkish Cavalry (unless those be∣longing to the Baggage) fled by the way of the Moor or Marshy Ground (with which they were acquainted) towards So∣phia and Nicopolis, leaving the Mountains on the Right Hand, and the three Bridges on the Left; and all their Camp, with their Tents and Baggage both within and without the City, for a Prey and Booty to the Victorious Christians: Many Co∣lours, four Horse-Tails, some thousands of Horses, and other Beasts, were taken, with great quantities of Forage: Above a thousand Turks were killed on the place, with many Prisoners: In short, the plun∣der of the City was given for a Prey to the wearied Soldiers, who had well de∣served it for a Reward of their Valour, and indefatigable Labours, and for an En∣couragement to future Services. The Germans gained greater Honour by this Action than by any other of this Summer's Expedition; for their Forces were few, and the Enemies fought with more Resolution and Bravery than they had done in any former Engagement; for in none were more killed, and wounded than in this. Count Veterani received a Wound with a Musket-shot, and Count Traut∣mansdorf with a Scimetar, and both in the Head; and Baron Orlich, a Lieutenant Colonel, was killed on the place. But as yet the Castle of Widin held out, for which reason the Soldiers kept a watch about it all Night, that the Defendants might not have an opportunity to make their Escape. The next Morning the Castle was sum∣moned, but no Answer being given, the Prince sent a Turk to the Commander, to let him know,The Turks refuse to deliver the Castle of VVidin. That unless he did Sur∣render up the Castle and Garrison that very Day, he was not to expect any Quar∣ter, or Conditions of Mercy. It was not long before the Turk returned from the Castle, with a fierce Answer from the Go∣vernour, That he and his Companions were resolved to defend the Castle to the last drop of their Blood. Prince Lewis was not a little displeased at this Answer, because for want of Provisions he was in some haste to remove his Camp; but not to leave such a necessary Work as this imperfect, he immediately dispatched a∣way to Semendria, for Cannon, Mortars, and Ammunition; And having raised on the 16th of October, a Battery, he plied the Castle so hard, that the Turks spread a white Flag and came to Capitulations, which were soon agreed, upon Terms;The Castle of VVi∣din sur∣renders. That the Garrison and People therein might march forth with all their Goods: for Carriage of which, 30 Boats were to be assigned them;The Soldi∣ers and People march out. but in regard Boats were not to be procured, 200 Carts were provided in the place thereof; So that on the 19th of October, 2559 Soldiers, all Armed, with about as many Inhabitants, marched out of the place, which were Convoyed by 200 Dragoons towards Ni∣copolis; and the Hostages being committed to safe Custody, five Companies of the Regiment of Dunghen, were placed there∣in for a Garrison. Upon the Report only of the march of the Imperialists towards Widin, Tekeli a∣bandoned the City, tho' he had a stately House therein, and very well furnished; yet so debased was he in his Courage, that he fled before the Battle towards Ni∣copolis; from whence he came with a sad Countenance, and Tears in his Eyes, to meet the Garrison and People expelled from the Town and Castle: Howsoever, he showed a courteous Aspect to the
German Soldiers, who were appointed for Convoy to the People of Widin, and in a Friendly manner treated them with Wine, and a plentiful Entertainment. Widin a place of much ad∣vantage to the Chri∣stians.As Widin was a great loss to the Turks, so it was of high advantage to the success∣ful Arms of the Emperor; for by taking this place, all the Conquests made by the two last Victories, namely the Territory of Nissa, and other Places possessed on the Way to Sophia, were all covered, and the Way secured for importing Forage and Pro∣visions, and all Necessaries for support of the advanced Troops under Piccolomini, posted for guard and defence of the Con∣quered Countries, and free Communication and Correspondence with the Neighbouring Principalities: And on the contrary the Turks of Temeswaer, and other Garrisons maintained in the Upper Hungary, were all greatly streightned and annoyed thereby, without any hopes of being succoured, or relieved; and thereby Tekeli also was dis∣lodged from those Parts, in which he had perswaded the People by his fair Words and Promises, to remain constant and faith∣ful, and stand by the Grand Seignior with their Lives and Fortunes. Winter Quarters provided for the Sol∣diers.It being now towards the end of October, it was judged high time to give refreshment and ease to the wearied Soldiery, by putting them into warm and commodious Quarters during the Winter Season. The Province of Walachia was a Country near to them, a∣bounding with all sorts of Provisions, and there it was intended to Quarter a great part of the Army. Upon which Resolution Prince Lewis di∣spatched to the Prince of Walachia these following Propositions, requiring an imme∣diate Compliance therewith, otherwise that he would do himself Reason with his Sword, giving him only six Days time to return an Answer. The Propositions made to the Prince of Walachia and the States of that Province, dated the 28th of October, were as fol∣loweth. Propositions made by the Prince of Walachia. WHEREAS it hath pleased Al∣mighty God to give many signal Victories unto His Imperial Majesty, whereby several Cities, Countries, and Provinces have been recovered out of the Barbarous Possession of the Turks, and thereby also Walachia secured from Servi∣tude and Slavery; in consideration where∣of, it was demanded from the Prince and States, that Winter Quarters be given for the space of seven Months for 15000 Men Horse and Foot, according to the Rules and Proportions which have been setled by the Imperial Decrees in former times, both in Hungary and Transilvania: That is to say, from the first of November 1689, to the last of May 1690, in the manner following. I. That two Pounds of Bread shall be provided for every Man per Day,For Winter Quarters. with a Pound of Flesh, and a Measure of Wine, besides his Bed, Salt, Candle, Wood, and all other Necessaries for support of Hu∣mane Life. That four Bushels of Oats a Month, eight Pounds of Hay a Day, with two Bundles of Straw a Week, shall be allowed for every Horse. II. That the Prince and States shall pay unto the Soldiers 800000 Florins within a certain time. III. That the Prince and States shall find 1500 good Horse, to mount those Cava∣liers who have lost their Horses, and also shall find them Armour within a certain time, according as hath been practised in Hereditary Kingdoms and Provinces; the Arms for Cuirasiers shall not be valued at more than 30 Dollars for every Horse∣man, and 25 for every Dragoon, the which shall be defalked out of the Sum of the ready Money which is to be paid. IV. That the Deputies sent by the Prince and States, shall return to them a∣gain; and in the space of six Days, shall come back to the Imperial Camp, with the positive Resolution of what shall be performed in this Matter, and shall bring with them Commissaries, who shall allot to the Soldiers their respective Quar∣ters. V. That the Prince and States shall ap∣point and ordain Hostages; namely, two Barons of the chief Nobility in the Pro∣vince, who shall remain with the Imperial General as Guarantees for performance of the Treaty, and that the Prince may have liberty to change and relieve them every Month (if he pleases) with two others. VI. That in case the Prince and States shall punctually comply with these Pro∣positions, they are hereby assured in the Name of His Imperial Majesty, That neither the Emperor's General, nor any other Officer, or Soldier shall bind, or ob∣lige them to any other Conditions, nor shall they in the least manner be farther oppressed, or damnified, but to the con∣trary
they shall be succoured, defended, and protected in the free Exercise of their Laws, and maintained in their Rights, Privileges, and Possessions. Given in the Imperial Camp under Fe∣tislau, the 28th of October, 1689. Signed, Lewis of Baden. About this time the Express which Prince Lewis had dispatched lately to Piccolomini, returned back with this following Letter. Count Piccolomini to Prince Lewis. IF Your Most Serene Highness shall be plea∣sed to return me back all Your Army, I can here give them Quarters and good Subsi∣stence. The Albanians of Clementa have sent their Deputies to me, with Proposals to sub∣mit unto the Emperor, with whom I am now in Treaty. The Albanians under the Turks have done the like, and have offered to surrender unto me all their Castles. I have summoned all the Greek Communities to come unto me; and I have sent the Draughts of the Imperial Escutcheon, or Arms, which I brought painted from Vienna to be affixed and set up in every Town and City: And I hope speedily to bring all the Countries from Scutari to Novibassar under subjection. Upon these Successes, I hear that Mamut Pasha is fled, and I have sent to seek for his Horse-Tail which the Vizier gave him. The City of Prisseren being abandoned▪ by its Inhabitants, I intend to make use there∣of. Ten Thousand Rascians with Arms in their Hands are come in to me without any Head or Commander, with intention to rob, and live on Violence and Rapin. I know not what to do with these Wild Beasts, for upon pretence of coming in to us, I know not how to restrain them, tho' they ruine and spoil all the Country, and put me into some Fears and Apprehensions for them, whilst their Outrages affright others from coming in. To dismiss them out of our Army, I fear something worse, and to keep them, is to suffer them to destroy all. I am going to the Pass of Cavinigh, intending to secure my self on every side. How I may succeed at Uscopia I do not as yet know. Our People lately discovered great Numbers of Turks as∣sembled together in the Castle of Novibord, which is upon the Mountains, who upon our Summons surrendered at discretion. I have many Irons in the fire, but too weak a force for execution of any great design, howsoever I will do what I can, as becomes Your Highness, &c. Count Piccolomini. Upon these encouraging Advices, Prince Lewis resolved to detach Prince Charles of Hanover, with three Regiments, viz. of Sarau Hanover, and the Infantry of Croy, to reinforce Piccolomini at Procopia,Picolomi∣ni rein∣forced. where was a Magazine replenished with Hay, Oats, Flour, and every thing for the Subsistence of an Army. With these Recruits Piccolo∣mini on the 14th of this Month marched from Procopia towards Uscopia; and the Day following came to a narrow Passage which the Turks call a Dervent; where meet∣ing with a Deserter from Sophia, they were advised by him that the Turks had a design upon Nissa, for which reason retarding their March, until the 17th, they learned within that time that those Informations were only the Lyes of Greeks, who are na∣turally false, and haters of the Western Christians; whereupon they took their March for two Days through the Moun∣tains, on which are the two Counties of Clementa and Rossaiava, which had never paid Taxes, or Contributions to the Turks,Count Pi∣colomini marches towards Pristina and Clina. but rather the Turks unto them. In these Countries they made no stay, but hasted with all expedition possible towards Pristina and Clina, where they had understood from the advanced Guards, that 6000 Arnouts, with 1300 Carts, and many Thousand Head of Cattle remained in expectation to joyn with the Germans, and to oppose the Turks with all the People of the Country, and to yield themselves Subjects and Vassals to His Imperial Majesty.They conclude a Treaty with the People. And Kazi∣anech. Being arrived at Pristina, they concluded a Treaty with those People; and on the 23th they pro∣ceeded to a certain little City with a Castle called Kazianech. Upon the News of this Approach, the Turks fled the Night before; but a Party of Horse pursuing after them, they happily encountered within the Moun∣tains near a Bridge, with 300 Turks,Defeat a Party of 300 Turks. which were coming from Scopia, to reinforce the Castle of Kazianech, which was already ta∣ken; and tho' it was Night, yet they at∣tacked them, and killed 19, taking some Horses, 4 Colours, and 11 Slaves: And here it was necessary to make a Halt for a short time to secure a Pass which was in the middle way, which was so rugged and nar∣row, that the Cannon not being able to pass, they were remanded back to Kazia∣nech, with all the Carts of heavy Bag∣gage. In two Days time more they marched through this narrow Pass, and entered into a large Plain, distant about three Hours from Scopia, where they received different intelligences of the State of Affairs in that City, some reported that the Turks were re∣solved to defend the Place unto the utmost Extremity; others, that those People who
the Night before had escaped from the At∣tack, had given a terrible Alarm to the Town,Mamut Pasha en∣camped in a Valley with 10000 Mn, flies upon a Re∣port that the Chri∣stians were marching against them. insomuch that the Turks and Greeks had abandoned the place, and had joyned themselves to Maut Pasha, who with 10000 Men was encamped in a Valley. Nothing could come more joyful to the Christian Army, than to hear that the Turks had quitted their Walls, and places of De∣fence, to draw into an open Plain; with which they were so animated, that they gave a Salvo with the 10 pieces of Cannon which they had with them, and with such Shouts of the Soldiers, as if the Victory had been already in their Hands: At the sound whereof, the Turks were put into such a Consternation, that they quitted their Camp and fled for refuge and shelter into the Neighbouring Woods; but being pur∣sued and hunted by the Hussars,Are pursu∣ed by the Hussars. and some few Germans, many Turks were killed, and 2000 Carts belonging to the Country Peo∣ple, were set at liberty, which the Turks had pressed for their Service, to carry away whole Families of Men, and Women, and Children into Slavery: Moreover some Christian Slaves were recovered, together with a considerable Booty, besides above 100 Turks, and as many Jews were made Prisoners. In this manner the Way being made open, Piccolomini marched into the adjacent Coun∣tries of Scopia, in which he found the anci∣ent Seat of Count Ladislaus Cziacchy,The Anti∣ent Seat of Ladislaus Cziacchy plundered and burnt. which was of a much more capacious and large extent than it was supposed to be; howsoe∣ver without a Wall, Ditch, Cannon, Peo∣ple, or Money; howsoever there was in it a large Magazine, filled with all sorts of Grain, Flour, and other sorts of Provisions and Merchandize; but according to the Re∣port of the Inhabitants, much infected with the Pestilence: There was also an old rui∣nous Castle, conserved only for its Antiqui∣ty. Piccolomini not giving much credence to these Reports, went in person to visit the place; where having considered the Situa∣tion of it, and the difficulty to maintain it, he gave it over to the plunder of the Sol∣diery, and afterwards putting Fire to it in several places, the Houses were all in a short time reduced to Ashes together with several stately Moschs and Fountains. Piccolo∣mini re∣tirs back to Kazia∣nech.Upon these Successes Piccolomini retired back towards Kazianech, which he had left defended with a strong Garrison, the Peo∣ple flocking thereunto in great Numbers to be protected, and received for Subjects of His Imperial Majesty. At this place having divided his Army, he detached a Party under Command of the Prince of Holstein, with a Regiment of Cui∣rasiers belonging to the Hanover Troops, to march towards the Mount Hemus; and with the remainder of the Forces, he went himself to Lippian, and thence he detached Colonel Strasser with his Regiment of Foot, and six pieces of Cannon towards Bosnia, to drive the Turks out of the Castles of Zwet∣zey and Panza.Piccolo∣mini sick, yet marches towards Prisseren, And tho' the Sickness of Piccolomini increased upon him, which some People termed the Plague; yet his active Soul strugling with the Distemper, he took a March with his own Regiment, and that of Stirum, with two pieces of Cannon, to∣wards Albania, to discover and inform him∣self what his Lieutenant Colonel the Baron of Hebersburg had acted in Prisseren with his Albanians:Novemb. Whilst he was in this March his Fever increased, so that he was con∣strained to rest a while with his Army at Capuschmit, where he received advice, that Lieutenant Colonel Maursberg of the Regi∣ment of Stirum, had possessed himself of the Castle of Panza; but that the other of Zwetzey, being situate on a Rock, refused to Surrender, unless compelled thereunto by Fire and Cannon. Tho' the Disease of Piccolomini increased, yet he could not be perswaded to take a longer rest and repose, which is necessary in Fevers; but being full of Zeal, and de∣sire of Triumph, he marched with his Re∣giments towards Panni;And to Panni. on the way to which, Advices came to him, That the Commander of Pyroth,The Com∣mander of Pyroth de∣feats 1500 Turks. with a Party of Ger∣mans, and 800 Hussars, had taken the Field in the Enemies Country, where at the first they had the good fortune to defeat a Party of 1500 Turks, which they found encamp∣ed near Dragoman, a place distant about six or seven Hours from Sophia, where they had posted themselves, to observe the Mo∣tions of the Imperial Forces; but that soon afterwards the Turks being Alarm'd in all their Quarters near Sophia, they appeared in several Bodies on both sides of the Moun∣tain,The Impe∣rialists de∣feated near Drago∣man. with Reserves both of Turks and Tar∣tars; and having with their Numbers sur∣rounded the Germans, after a great Slaugh∣ter on both sides, the Christians were forced to give back, and betake themselves to Flight. To repair the damage, and prevent the ill Consequences of this Surprize, Piccolo∣mini without any delay dispatched positive Orders to Colonel Strasser, to desist from his Enterprises in Bosnia, and return to Nis∣sa, least the Enemy encouraged by this Success, should adventure to make an At∣tempt upon that place. In the mean time Piccolomini continuing his March,Piccolo∣mini comes to Prisse∣ren. on the 6th of this Month came early in the Morning under the Walls of Prisseren, where he was met by the Arch∣bishop of Albania, and the Patriarch of Cle∣menta,
carrying a Standard in which a Cross was painted, and followed by 8000 Arnouts, Geceks of Albania, Turks, and Christians, with other Natives of those Countries; who having given their Salvoes with three Vollies of Muskets, they joyned with the Germans, declaring their Resolutions to live and die with them in the common Cause. Count Piccolomini, tho' in a languishing Condition, was yet much relieved by such a surprising appearance of People, who came with humble submission to devote them∣selves to the Imperial Soveraignty, but be∣ing acquainted with the unsetled and volu∣ble Temper of that People, he knew not what to think of this suddain Revolution, until he had first satisfied himself by the Archbishop, and some of the Officers, (who were the first of those that were come in) that this People would prove obedient, and constant to the Emperor's Interest; with which Report Piccolomini remaining satisfi∣ed,The Ar∣nouts list themselves. he caused all the Soldiers to be listed under his Banner; with this Temperament howsoever, that all those who were desirous to retire, and live like orderly Citizens within the Walls of Towns, or in the Fields to cultivate the Ground, should have a free liberty so to do, and be protected by the Imperial Arms: But as to those who were willing to follow the Camp, and be formed into regular Troops, should be obliged to take the Military Oath,And form∣ed into re∣gular Troops. binding themselves to all Obedience and Respect towards their Commanders, and to live according to the rigour and exact Rules of Military Disci∣pline. So soon as Piccolomini had made this De∣claration, and given this Charge to the new Soldiery, his Disease increased upon him, of which being sensible, he sent to the Archbishop to perform all those Offices, which were to be done in the time of the last Agony;Piccolo∣mini's Death. which being administred with great Devotion, this brave General expired his last, to the unexpressible Lamentation of the whole Army, and Sorrow of the Impe∣rial Court. The Command and Government of all the Conquered Countries,Decemb. having been pro∣mised to General Veterani, upon News of the Death of Piccolomini, he prepared to take possession thereof; but in the mean time that the Army might not be destitute of a General, the Conduct thereof was commit∣ted to the care of the Prince of Holstein,Prince of Holstein Commands the Army. to maintain and support the Conquests of those parts, until Veterani should come and take possession thereof. Thus ended the Campaign of 1689, glo∣rious in the whole progress thereof to the Imperial Arms, the Victories whereof over the Turks being scarce to be numbred, filled Vienna, and the Hereditary Countries with Joy and Triumph. And here it had been happy for the Empire, and all Europe, had the Germans fixed the Conclusion of the War at this period, before the Air of For∣tune, which had blown for some Years with a prosperous Gale in favour of the Ger∣mans, had changed her Kindness, which we shall find in the following Year inconstant and favouring the Enterprize of the Turks. It is a most unaccountable Infatuation, That the Imperial Court, observing before their Eyes the vast Preparations of France to at∣tack the Empire,Mustapha Aga comes to renew the Treaty of Peace. should not have endea∣voured to quench the Fire of War on one side, an Opportunity for which so fairly of∣fered it self, by the Arrival of Mustapha Aga, sent with Letters from the Ottoman Port to the Turkish Ambassadors detained in the Castle of Puttendorf, to renew the Treaty, which had for some time been laid aside. The Imperial Court was at this time at Auspurg busied in the Election and Coro∣nation of the King of the Romans; and therefore the Emperor appointed Count Quintinio Jergher, Knight of the Golden-Fleece, and Counsellor of State, and Lord Lieutenant of the Hereditary Countries of Austria; together with Baron Dorsch Secre∣tary and Counsellor of War, to enter into Conference with the Turkish Ambassadors; to whom also was joyned the Cavalier Gi∣rolamo Venier, who was Ambassador to the Emperor from Venice, and there attending the Interest of that Republick, in regard to this Treaty. But before the Turks would enter into the Particulars, they dispatched a certain Bey to the Congress, with some Considerations and Reflections which might represent the State and Temper of the Ot∣toman Empire, not to remain in so vile and debased an Estate, as to beg a Peace; but that they were still able with their Swords in their Hands to Treat, and in case of fai∣lure of an Agreement, to maintain a War. The Considerations offered were these. Considerations Offered by the Turks. I. THAT they should conceive a right Notion of the great Power of the Ottoman Port. II. That the Christians favoured rather by Fortune, than by the strength of their own Power, had gained all those Victories of which they now Triumph.
III. That all the Insurrections in Asia, and Civil Commotions amongst themselves were now appeased. IV. That the Sultan had diminished much of his Expences, and reduced the Number of useless Officers in his Seraglio, whereby vast Sums were spared for Main∣tenance of the War. V. That the Taxes on the People, were raised from five Dollars on every House, un∣to a hundred. VI. That it might now be hoped, that the Anger of God being appeased for the Sins of the Believers, the Christians turn would shortly come, when they also should be punished for their Offences. VII. That the Ottoman Empire was still powerful, both in Men and Money. VIII. That the Sultan would in lieu of Belgrade, which upon the Peace must be surrendered, that the Save might be made the Confines of both Empires, yield up to the Emperor some other Fortresses, as an Equivalent for that important City. These preliminary Suggestions were ge∣nerally turned into Ridiculous Interpreta∣tions, and Commentaries thereupon; so that in Answer thereunto these following Reflections were drawn up, which eviden∣ced the Scorn and Disdain, the Imperial∣ists at that time conceived of the Turkish Power. Answers to the Considerations Offered. TO the First it was reply'd, That the Ottoman Power consisted more in Numbers than in Force; an Evidence where∣of appears to the World, in that the Turks, who for the space of 300 Years had waged a War in Hungary, do now scarce possess a Foot, or Palm of that Kingdom, unless in some few Cities, which are yet so streight∣ned by Blockades, that they are ready to perish with Famine, and offer themselves up to the Mercy of the Emperor. Witness also the Success before Vienna, when Besieg∣ed by 300000 Turks, were not yet able to render themselves Masters of the same, but were forced to fly, and ignominiously to turn their Backs to a quarter part of their Number, and forced to return without o∣ther Glory, than that only of burning some Villages, which might have been done by a Rabble of People, or 100 Incendiaries. To the Second it was said, That with the Divine Assistance, the Christian Troops, tho' much inferiour in Number to those of the Turks, had won divers Battles during this War, and made themselves Masters of many Towns, and Castles; and particular∣ly of Buda and Belgrade, the Capital Cities of great Provinces, which were not subdu∣ed by long Sieges, but by Storms, and dint of Sword. To the Third it was said, That the Trou∣bles in Asia still continued, and their Civil and Domestick Seditions, not as yet ap∣peased, and were yet likely to increase higher, by reason of their Tyrannical Go∣vernment, which the oppressed People would not longer endure. To the Fourth it was said, That the Dis∣charge of the Women, and Officers, to the Number of 4000 out of the Seraglio, was an evident Token of their want of Money to sustain the War. To the Fifth it was said, That the heavy Burden of Taxes, from five to a 100, was the ready means to move the People to a Rebellion, of which there are frequent Ex∣amples in all Histories. To the Sixth, that howsoever the Turks might flatter themselves with the pacificati∣on of God's Anger against them, they would yet find the contrary, and prove the just Revenge of the Just God, whom they had provoked by the Breach of their Faith, and Oppressions of those People whom they had subdued. To the Seventh, That there was great difference between Soldiers and Incendia∣ries, in the latter of which the Turks ought rather to be reckoned, than amongst the for∣mer. To the Eighth, which concerns the Sur∣render of Belgrade, it was replyed, That the Emperor would sooner surrender New∣stadt in Austria, or the Gardens about Vien∣na, than that City, with which this Confe∣rence was concluded. Amongst all the foregoing Particulars, we find nothing solid or material, or under any Dispute, unless that point of exchang∣ing Belgrade for some other place or places, not as yet Conquered in Hungary; that so the River Save might be the limit and con∣fine between the two Empires: Nor was it probable, that the Turks would have bro∣ken off the Treaty on this Point only, had
they not hearkened to the Promises of the French, who now being sensible how useful, and necessary the Alliance of the Turks would be to them,The French and Court of Rome, obstruct the Peace. were resolved not to lose the Benefit of so helpful an Associate; and therefore used all their perswasive Ar∣guments to continue the War, which were inculcated with mighty Presents to the principal Officers of State, and Assurances that with the next Spring they would not only enter the Empire with such vast Ar∣mies, as should oblige the Emperor to withdraw his Forces out of Hungary; but also assist them both with Money, and with able Engineers and Officers to carry for∣ward the War. And indeed tho' in the following Year of 1690, we shall not find any great mat∣ter warmly acted by the French on Germany, pursuant to the Promises they had made unto the Turk; yet we shall find them in a Year or two afterwards entering Germany with Fire and Sword; and in the Year 1693, besides the Conquests gained in Brabant and Flanders; we shall hear of the burning of Heidelberg, and all the Upper Germany in danger of an entire Desolati∣on: All which might easily have been prevented, had the Emperor hearkened at this time to the Offers of the Turks, who came prepared to accept of any Conditi∣ons, that in reason could have been impo∣sed upon them. But this Opportunity be∣ing let slip, Fortune changed its Course, and the Exploits of War were acted with various Successes; and tho' afterwards the Emperor sought for Peace by Interposition of Mediators, the Turks were so far enga∣ged with the French, and so encouraged by their Successes, that they would now hear∣ken to nothing under the Surrender of Buda, and all the Conquests in Hun∣gary. The Loss of this Opportunity for gain∣ing a Peace,The Rea∣sons for which the Peace was obstructed. may be attributed to the In∣fatuation of the Minds of the Germans, blinded for punishment of the Sins of Chri∣stendom. No doubt but the French Facti∣on in the Imperial Court, availed much in the defeat of this Design, as did also the power of the Papal Court, in which at that time Alexander VIII. reigned; who hear∣ing of the Overtures of Peace treating at Ausburg and Vienna, dispatched away from Rome, Cardinal Colonitz, with Instructi∣ons about the Affairs of Hungary, who af∣ter having assisted in divers Consultations, and Conferences thereupon, the whole Treaty broke off, and the Ambassadors dis∣missed from all farther Negotiations, of which we shall very speedily bewail the fatal Effects.
THE Venetian Successes In Their WAR against the TURKS, In the Year 1689. IN the preceeding Year we made a Relation of the Venetian War against the Turks,January. maintained in the Island of Negropont, and against the chief City thereof known by that Name. The Enterprize was of great Importance, and the Preparations for the same agreeable to so mighty a Design, which had it succeed∣ed, would not only have settled and esta∣blished the Venetians in their Conquests of the Morea, but rendered them Masters of all the Coast of Romania; but the Ve∣tians instead thereof, being compelled by Sickness, and unfortunate Attacks upon the place, in which they lost many of their brave Officers, to quit the Island with some Confusion, and as it were stealing off in the Night, for fear the Enemy should fall on their Rear, Cannon and Baggage; but the Turks being desirous to be rid of such Guests, were willing to have made a Bridge for them, rather than to have administred the least Retardment, or Hindrance to their Departure. All the Auxiliary Gallies, as those of the Pope, Malta, and Florence, being re∣tired (as we have said) to their respective Countries; the main Body of the Veneti∣an Armata entered into the Port of Na∣poli di Romania,The Vene∣tian Fleet Winters at Napoli de Romania. with design to Winter there, so as better to Command the Ar∣chipelago, and to be near Negropont, so as to be ready to obstruct the Turks in case they should Attempt to repair those Works, it being intended to make another Attack on that place early in the Spring; and to that end Orders were sent to Venice to dispatch away the Recruits for the Land Forces, with all Necessaries for the Fleet, and Provisions for the Winter, of which there was so great want, that both the Land and Sea Forces had much difficulty to subsist, so melancholy a Countenance was put on through the whole Camp, that nothing but the prevailing Authority of their Doge and Captain-General could restrain them from a Mutiny;The Vene∣tians in some di∣stress. but that which a little comforted the Soldiery, was the mildness of the Winter, which gave a cheerful green colour to the Fields, which yielded Herbs, and Winter-Fruits in much Plenty; and because the Buildings of the Town had been much destroyed and ruined by the Bombs, and Cannon, they raised little Hutts and Cottages for shelter, and Lodgings for the Soldiery; to which the Athenians, who had no great desire to re∣turn to their own City, had greatly con∣tributed, having Built divers Houses at their own Cost, and with their own La∣bour. But what most dis-spirited the Army, was the Sickness of the Doge Morosini, who long had laboured under a violent Fever, in such a manner, that the Physi∣cians themselves despaired of his Life; for Conservation of which, solemn Prayers and Processions were appointed to be made,The Doge sick. both at Venice, and in all Places under that Dominion. At length, after a tedious Expectation, the Convoy arrived, to the universal Joy and Consolation of all the Forces and Country round about;February. which began to give new Life to all Motions and Enter∣prizes, and to inspire the Soldiers with a new stock of Courage; for all People having been supplied both with Money and Provisions;A Convoy with Money and Provi∣sion arrives from Ve∣nice. the Carpenters fell hear∣tily to Work on the Vessels, and Gallies, to repair and make them fit for the next Voyage, and the Soldiers remained ready to Embrace any new Enterprize: But the Doge continuing sick, and reduced to a great weakness and debility of Body, put a damp on the Spirits of the Soldiery, and much retarded the proceedings of all Designs.
For tho' the Captain Extraordinary Ve∣nier, was Commanded with his Ships to watch, and guard one side of the Chan∣nel of Negropont,Turkish Forces landed at Negro∣pont. and Captain Valier Com∣mander of the Great Alexander to attend the other: yet the Captain Pasha broke into Negropont, with ten Gallies, and there landed 500 Men, promising them by Or∣der of the Sultan, in a short time, a much greater force, with which they should be supplied very speedily: and that in the mean time, they should labour with all possible industry to repair the Works which the Enemies Bombs and Cannon had ruin∣ed; so that the Venetians were not able to obstruct the Turks from giving Relief to Candia, but instead thereof, had the Mis∣fortune to lose two of their Gallies by Storm, and were forced to return back again to Napoli di Romania, where their chief Comfort was, that the Sickness be∣gan to decrease, which had for some time raged both in the Fleet, Army, and Coun∣tries round the City. March.The Spring coming on, the Doge began to recover his Health and Strength again,Morosini recovers his Health. to the great Joy of all the Soldiery, so that he could now attend to Business, and give Orders to the Armata, which had been so well repaired, and Careened, as that the Gallies were in a Condition al∣ready to put to Sea: Notwithstanding all which, the Turks were not obstructed in their passage to Negropont,Negro∣pont sup∣plied. where four Gal∣lies belonging to the Beyes arrived, bring∣ing Spades, Shovels, Pick-axes, and seve∣ral other Instruments for repairing the Breaches made last Year by the Enemy; on which, their Slaves, being dis-enchain'd from the Oar, laboured Day and Night with all diligence; and Missir Ogli, with some Gallies, was also arrived, being sent to forward that Work; for the Turks had an Opinion, that the Venetians would make another Attempt thereupon, and which should be the Work of the following Sum∣mer. But the Venetians had suffered so much the last Year before Negropont, that they esteemed themselves in no good Condition for a second Enterprize, they having not as yet licked their Wounds whole, nor recruited their Army, which was much more weak than it was the Year past, and unable to undertake an Enterprize in which they had already been foiled. How∣soever, not to sit Idle, and look about them, their Aim was on Malvasia, to re∣duce which, ten Gallies, and 12 Galleots were dispatched by the Captain-General to assist in the Building of two Forts near the Bridge entering to the Town, on which the Mainotes, whom the Captain-General had armed, were labouring to finish, be∣ing of great importance towards a Block∣ade, and to hinder all Vessels from bring∣ing Provisions to the place: And farther to proceed in this Design, the whole Arma∣ta was Commanded to Sail to Porto Porro, appointed as it was the last Year, to be the Magazine for Arms, Provisions, and Am∣munition for the War; where being ar∣rived, they attended the Duke of Gua∣dagne, with his Troops for Reinforcement of the Army; and in the mean time, the Bridge was broken, and the two Forts be∣fore Malvasia were finished, and a great number of Boats, Felucca's, and Palan∣dra's, lay before the Town to hinder all sorts of Provisions and Succours from be∣ing brought into it, by which the place was entirely blocked up on all sides,Malvasia blocked up. both by Sea and Land; for the situation of the Town being on a Peninsula, there was no Communication could be had with the Country but by the Bridge, and a narrow spot of Land. Whilst Maters remained in this Nature before Malvasia, a certain Greek, called Li∣berachi, lay encamped near Xeromero alias Missolonghi, with about 100 Turks,Liberachi encamped. 150 Sclavonians, and some Deserters from the Venetian Army. This Liberachi or Liberio, was a Mainote by Nation, a Fellow bold and subtle, and did great Services for the Venetians, until he was taken Prisoner by the Turks and carried to Constantinople: He had not remained any long time there, before he gained such Credit with the Turks, that by his fair Words and Pro∣mises, they were perswaded that he could draw all the Mainotes to their Party, and cause them to Revolt from the Venetians. Upon which Opinion, they set him at Liberty, and entertained such Confidence of him, that they gave him the Title and Charge of Bey, that is, Lord of the Mainotes; whereby many Deserters from the Venetian Camp came in to him; And some Propositions for joyning Forces passed between him and Ensign Bossina,He purposes to joyn with Bos∣sina. who in the Month of October 1687. with most part of the People called Oltramarines, had De∣serted and listed themselves under this Bos∣sina, who stiled himself Commander in Chief of the Deserters; and having his Head-quarters at Carpenizi, towards the Confines of Lepanto, he exacted Contri∣butions from the Villages and Countries round about: With him joyned some other seditious Captains, and a certain Ensign called Vito of Captain Rado's Compa∣ny, a Fellow of a bold Spirit, without Faith or Honesty; and with him he de∣bauched several dissolute Soldiers to for∣sake the Camp and joyn with Bossina.
The Troops of Liberachi being greatly in∣creased by this Conjunction, the Venetian Generals consulted in what manner they might give a stop to this Desertion,The Vene∣tians f ar the increase of Libera∣chi's For∣ces. and cut to pieces Liberachi, Bossina, Vito, and their Followers: In the first place it was resolved to declare, That ten Zechins should be given for the Head of every De∣serter, or for any that should be brought alive to the Camp; the which produced an excellent Effect; for hereupon many of the Albanians, who had designed to be of the Conspiracy, changed their Minds, and having possessed themselves of the narrow Passes from Thebes to Petra, Negropont, and Vola,The Reme∣dy. seized on many of them, and brought them back to the Camp, where they sustained the Punishment which their Treachery deserved; by which means the Conspiracy was broken, and many of those who watched an opportunity to Escape, contained themselves within the Limits of their Duty. But the manner how to Ruin Liberachi was much more difficult,A Plot laid against Li∣berachi. and some Con∣sultations were held thereupon: At length it was concluded, That the only way to Effect this Stratagem, was either by allu∣ring him into the Hands of the Venetians, or by rendring him suspected to the Turks; who upon the least Jealousie were ready to apply the Bow-string to his Throat. To this purpose, a certain Captain, called John Dambi, offered himself, a Person of great Bravery and Conduct,A Plot a∣gainst Li∣berachi. and a good Soldier; one who spake Turkish, Greek, and Italian, and was very well versed in all the Manners, Ceremonies, and Customs of the Turks; and above all, that which made him the most proper Instrument for this work, was, That he had been a most intimate Friend of this Liberachi; for ha∣ving been a Fellow Slave with him, and linked in the same Chain at Constantinople, they became sworn Brothers,Dambi sent to him and made Protestations of mutual and unviolable Friendship ever to continue; and that af∣ter they should be eased of their Chains, yet the same Bonds of Faith and Affection should never be dissolved. Nor was Dambi only his Friend; but the Doge Morosini had been Liberachi's Godfather, a Relation much endearing in that Country; and therefore the Title both of Friend, and Godfather, had great Charms with the generous Temper of Liberio; who upon the first notice given him by Dambi, that being at Lepanto, not far from Vracori, was very desirous to make him a Visit, he instantly dispatched a Pass, or Salvo Condotto to him, invi∣ting him with all the kind Terms imagi∣nable to come to him without the least scruple or fear imaginable. In Confidence of Liberachi's Fidelity, Dambi departed from Lepanto in Company with two Friends, and two Servants;Is kindly received by Liberachi. and in two days time arrived at Vracori, where he was received with all the Ceremony and kind Treatment that could be expected. Upon the News of a Stranger's arrival in that Town, the Turks were curious to know who he was, which Liberachi freely declared, saying, That he was come from the Venetian Armata, on no other Design, than as an old Friend, to see him, and tell old Stories of what Troubles and Miseries they had sustained together. The Turks supposing that he might be come over to their side, bid him kindly well∣come; as did also one Marco Stifichi, Cap∣tain of a Galleot, whom the Captain-Ge∣neral had for his many Pyracies commit∣ted to the Gallies; howsoever, in respect to the Oltramarines, had set him at liberty; but he, ungrateful for the favour received, fled to Liberachi, intending to side with the discontented, or rather licentious Mai∣notes under his Command.Their Con∣ference. After some Discourses over a Dish of Coffee and Sher∣bet, according to the Turkish Treatment, the Turks and Stifichi withdrew; and then Liberachi began to unbosom himself to Dambi, That the Obligations he had to the Captain-General, who in the year 1657, had Answered for him at the Holy Font in Calamata, were such, as called for all Respect and Duty to him; and more∣over, he could not but be sensible, that his most Serene Highness, could not but be displeased, and troubled to see one, whom he had made a Christian, to side with the Enemies to that Religion; and there∣fore he did not doubt, but that he had sent him, that is, Dambi, to endeavour to get him back to the right Way from whence he had swerved: Dambi hereupon confessed the same, and assured him from the Captain-General of Favour and Pro∣motion, in case he would return, and bring over with him the Revolted Mainotes, which would be a good Example for Bos∣sina, and his Oltramarines to follow.Liberachi excuses his coming o∣ver to the Veneti∣ans. To which Liberachi made this Reply; That he would most readily comply, were not his Obligations too great at Constantinople, where he had not only a Wife and Chil∣dren, but two Friends engaged for his Fi∣delity to the Grand Seignior, and which would most certainly suffer with the Ruin of their Families, should he Prevaricate from the Faith he had given to the Turks; moreover, he had Married the Widow of the late Prince of Moldavia, with an Estate of 20000 Crowns; in which Match, the Grand Vizier had been instrumental; so that his Sin of Ingratitude would be the
more notorious, should he make a Revolt after so many Kindnesses he had received on all sides. By this time Dinner was brought in, which was with great Plenty both of Dishes and Wine, well dressed, and very sumptuous; at which there was none present unless Liberachi himself, Dam∣bi, and his Priest. After Dinner, the same Discourse was carried on, and Dambi per∣sisted to urge him with all the Arguments which Reason could suggest to return un∣to his Duty; but Liberachi still persisted, that his Obligations to his Wife and Chil∣dren were so great, that they out-weighed the Duty to his Prince; for that the Laws of Nature and Faithfulness given to those, who had been Bail, and Security for his Fidelity, ought upon no Conside∣rations in the World to be violated, and therefore he desired his Friend to press him no farther upon that Point. At the end of this Discourse,Ali Bey disturbs the Dis∣course. one Ali Bey, sent with Money from the Seraskier to pay the Soldiery under Liberachi, came in, and demanded who this Dambi was; and be∣ing informed, that he was an Ancient Friend known to him at Constantinople, and came now to him from the Venetian Ar∣mata, for no other Reason than to make him a Visit: Ali Bey desired, that he might have him in his Custody, to carry before the Seraskier, promising upon his Faith to return him back again in Safety: But Liberachi refusing so to do, saying, That he had pawned his Word already that he should return back without Hin∣drance or Molestation; Ali Bey departed, but with some Threats, that he would make this Denial known unto the Seras∣kier, and how he had given Entertain∣ment to a suspected Stranger. Dambi fear∣ing some stop or trouble from hence would immediately take leave of his Friend, who just at his departure, desired him, that so soon as he should be arrived in the Morea, that he would kiss the Feet of his most Serene Highness, and return him a thousand Thanks for the great Goodness and Favours which he had by many in∣stances demonstrated unto him;Liberachi his Com∣pliment snt to the Doge. giving him to understand the Reasons and Causes which debarred him from enjoying the true Felicity of those many Offers of his most precious Grace and Favour: Howsoever, he gave him Assurances of doing all Ser∣vices possible to his Highness, by advising and informing him of all the Motions and Designs of the Turks; but because the practice hereof might be dangerous by Letters, which were subject to be inter∣cepted; he desired that his Highness would direct the way, and manner of such a Correspondence; And in the mean time, he pray'd Dambi to inform him, That the Seraskier was at Zittuni, with 4000 Sol∣diers, amongst which were 1200 Horse;Aa his Advices. That his Orders from the Grand Seignior were, That in case the Venetians should make a second Attempt upon Negropont, and that he had force sufficient, that then he should give them Battle, and not suffer them to Intrench before the City: But if on the contrary, the Venetians should be too strong for him, that then he should endeavour to make a Diversion, by falling into the Morea, wasting and consuming the Country; and that he, Liberachi, was ordered with his Forces, being about 2000 Men, to joyn with the Seraskier in this Action. And farther he desired him to acquaint the Captain-General, That in Negropont they had made a Pallisade round Carababa, about a Musket-shot distant from the Town, which was of great De∣fence to the place. Likewise, That Ibra∣him, who Commands in Negropont, had declared, That in case the Seraskier at Land should not assist him in the Defence of Carababa, it would be impossible to maintain and conserve the City; That they were making other Outworks to cover the place; That the Seraskier was ordered not to depend upon any Succours from Constantinople, but received Com∣mands to raise what Men he was able in the Parts where his Army was, as far as to Larissa; and that the Garrison of Negro∣pont consisted of no more than 3000 Men: And that the Orders which he himself had received, were to bring all the Country under Contribution from Salona to Santa Maura; which he was resolved to do with great rigour, by forcing them to pay ten Dollars a Head; by which means they would be constrained to fly for Refuge into Morea, which he thought would be of some Advantage to the Venetians. Dis∣coursing farther upon these Matters, Dam∣bi desired to know what was become of Captain Bossina, who Commanded the Ol∣tramarines, which had deserted from the Army; to which he gave Answer, That they were in the Villages of Carpenizi. In this manner,Dambi de∣parts. the Discourse being ended, Liberachi would accompany Dambi on some part of his way, and brought him four Miles with 70 Horse, and some Foot∣men, commanding also two of his Cap∣tains with some Men, to give him Con∣voy so far as the River Lepanto; to which place being conducted with safety, he was admitted with all readiness to the pre∣sence of his Serene Highness, who much applauded the punctual Relations and Ser∣vices of Dambi; hoping from thence, that the Plot could not fail that he had
laid for Liberachi; for either he would be forced thereby to leave the Service of the Turks, with many of his Followers, or otherwise falling into the Jealousie of the Turks by this free Conference, it could not but prove fatal to him; so that take it which way they would, Liberachi was under a necessity with his Men of seeking Refuge under the Protection of the Vene∣tian Arms. The Troops embarked.These Circumstances being well consi∣dered, were a sufficient motive to Embark the Troops, and to order some Ships, and other Vessels to sail forthwith to Malvasia, and to direct Orders to Gradenigo Prove∣ditor-Extraordinary, to march with the Horse into those Parts. But whilst the Doge was in a readiness to Embark, there arrived an Express with Letters from Deme∣trio Gaspari, an Athenian, dated at Culuri, advising, That he, and those Inhabitants had received Intelligence, That several Galleots belonging to the Enemy, were coming upon them, and therefore in all Humility, they supplicated, that they would come to their Assistance and Suc∣cour; Whereupon Orders being given to the Galleasses, Ships, and Galleots to sail for Malvasia,The Doge sails for Culuri. the Doge with the Gallies took his Course directly for Culuri; but before they could come thither, labouring against the Winds by force of their Oars, the Turks had been there, and transported from thence 350 Greeks, for the most part Women and Children; for the Men had secured themselves in the Mountains; but great Instances being made for their Tran∣sportation to some more secure place, and that they might be set ashore on the Island of Egena; it was ordered, that three Ves∣sels should attend, and carry them to what Place they should determine; and then the Doge proceeded to the Island of Spe∣cie, and the day following to Malva∣sia. And here having Intelligence, That se∣veral Barbarosse Ships infested the Coasts of Zant, and Sapienza, and had already taken a Patach belonging to Zant; the Doge began to be in some fear for the Convoy expected with Money from Ve∣nice for Subsistence of the Army, under the Command of Girolamo Cornaro Prove∣ditor-General of the Sea;Some fears for the Convoy coming from Ve∣nice. the which be∣ing debated at a Council of War, and the importance of the Matter well consider'd, it was resolved to dis-speed away immedi∣ately, the Proveditor of the Armata, Au∣gustino Sagredo, with twelve Gallies, and Lorenzo Venier, Captain-Extraordinary, with six Ships, with Orders to sail as far as Corfu to meet the aforesaid Cornaro, and to bring him and the Ships under his Convoy, laden with Money and other Necessaries, in security to the Fleet. In which matter, both the Commanders of the Gallies and Ships having received their Instruction, and having provided them∣selves with all things necessary for their Voyage, they set sail in few hours before Night. In the Morning the Ships were observed to be at some distance from the Shore, and at least ten Miles from the Gallies, which were making their way to Cape St. Angelo, the which gave some Trouble to the Doge, by thinking, that in case these two Divisions were so far separated at the beginning, what would become of them before the end of the Voyage; Whilst the Doge thought of these things, a great Fleet appeared Steering directly to that Port,The Duke of Gua∣dagne joyns the Fleet. which coming nearer was found to be the Fleet which brought the Duke of Guadagne, Serjeant-General Baron Spaar, and several other Officers, with 333 Foot Soldiers. About this time arrived the unhappy News of the loss of two Venetian Gallies,Two Vene∣tian Gal∣lies lost. one Commanded by Pietro Dona, and the other by Henrico Pappafava, both Vene∣tian Noblemen, taken by the Corsairs of Tripoli on the Coast of Sapienza. This Advice was very surprizing to the Doge, it being a loss which had not happened with so much Disgrace for many years to the Venetian Arms; and the more strange it was, in regard, That Francesco Dona was on Board the Galley, a Person of great Experience in Maritime Affairs, and yet suffered himself to be deceived by two white Streamers or Pendants which the Enemy had put forth, to be esteemed French, by which the Gallies were de∣coyed so near, as to be out of all possi∣bility of Escape. The Doge having laid Siege to the Town of Malvasia both by Sea and Land, a certain Slave,A Relation of the state of the Town. who had been Captain of a Tartana, having made an Escape from the Fortress, gave an Account of the State and Condition of the Town and Castle; relating, that the Garrison con∣sisted only of 700 stout Soldiers, with which, and with the Inhabitants, they might amount to about 2000 Souls, Wo∣men and Children, all resolved to defend themselves, as appeared by the Sequel. The Commanders in Chief were Mustapha Disdar, or Governor of the Castle, an antient Man, who carried great Authori∣ty and Resolution in his Face and Actions: And Assan Aga, who Commanded the Town, who upon approach of the Ene∣my, caused their Galleots, Brigantines, and smaller Boats and Vessels to be drawn
close under the Wall of the Town, for their better security; That the Houses of the Town were strongly built;May. and that the principal Persons thereof had filled all their upper Rooms with Earth, to cover them from the Bombs; but that the Streets for the most part were very nar∣row: That the Turks were then at work in drawing their Cannon to such parts of the Wall, from whence they might most annoy the Bridge: That the rich Inhabi∣tants were well supplied with Provisions, of which they were forced to Communi∣cate some part to the poorer sort: That the Garrison was not paid; but that con∣sisting for the most part of Natives of the Country, and Seamen inured to Hard∣ship and Pyracy, were contented to suffer and undergo any Trouble and Want for the Sake and Defence of their Native Ci∣ty: And in shorr, That besides the Gar∣rison there were about 160 Greeks, who kept Watch and Ward, and underwent all the Duties of a regular Militia. This Information gave some Retardment to the formal Siege and Attack of the place; for it was resolved to attend the arrival of the several Convoys, and Auxi∣liary Gallies shortly expected; and that in the mean time, the Town should be kept under a strict Blockade, and the Guards placed in all the Avenues and Pas∣sages to the Town, where the Duke de Gua∣dagne the General should judge most pro∣per to dispose them;June. and to lose no time, all the Troops were drawn into a Body, that a particular Review and Ac∣count might be taken of the Numbers and Condition of the whole Army. Whilst these things were acting, the eight Gallies of Malta began to appear, being then Doubling the Cape of St. An∣gelo,The Malta Gallies ar∣rived the 24th. Commanded by Fra. Carlo Spinelli, who was Bali of Armenia; a worthy Sol∣dier, and a Religious Commander, whose Fortune being to joyn the Venetian Fleet on St. John's Day their Tutelar Saint, ad∣ded very much to the Joy and Festivity of the Day. And what farther increased the Satisfaction both of the Fleet and Ar∣my, was at the same time to see the happy arrival of a Convoy Commanded by Pie∣tro Bembo,The Vene∣tian Convoy arrives. bringing 72000 Zechins in Gold for Service of the Army; upon which also arrived, the Prince de Harcourt, and Count Enea Rapetta Serjeant-Generals, besides several select Companies of Foot to the number of 455 Soldiers, with Provisions of all sorts for their Support and Main∣tenance; as also the Regiments of Hisy, and Simon Famsogna, both Colonels of Croatia, consisting of about 700 Foot; as also a Regiment of Dragoons of the the same Country, under the Command of Colonel Strel. After the Entrance of these several Gallies and Vessels into Port; and having cast Anchor in their orderly Divisions, and the Salutes made and re∣turned by Cannon, and Vollies of small shot, according to the customary Civili∣ties of the Seas,Visits made to the Doge. the Admiral of Malta attended with his Followers of Knights and Gentlemen, went to pay his Visit to the Doge, after the same manner as he had done the year before, (which hap∣pened then to be on the 16th of July) the Ducal Galley remain'd with it's An∣chor a-Pique, in an open place, having the Galleasses for Antiguards, with their Anchors also a-Pique, and with Streamers and Colours flying, as is usual in such Solemnities; The Doge received these Generals below on the Deck, and after∣wards conducted them into the Poop, where having entertained one the other, with Discourses of their respective Voy∣ages, and of the present state of the Camp before the Town, and passed other Civili∣ties and Compliments, they took their leaves, and returned to their several Ves∣sels. The next Day the Doge sent his Lieu∣tenant-General Andrea Pisani to return the Compliments in his Name with the like Ceremony,The Com∣plements returned, and to deliver unto those Ge∣nerals the several Ordinances of War, and the Instructions both for Fighting and Navigation. After which, a Council of War was called, at which the Doge, the General of Malta, the Duke of Guadagne, and all the General Officers both of Sea and Land, were present to Consult, and take such Measures as were most agree∣able to the present Exigencies. There were four Propositions made for employing their Arms, and four Designs offered, but they were all of so different a Nature, that they could not come to any Determination at that Meeting; but at length, after various Reflections made on the necessity there was of coming to a Resolution, it was concluded,The Result of a Coun∣cil of War. That General Guadagne should with his Cavalry take a view of the Streight of Corinth, (which is that Neck of Land which joyns the Morea to Greece) and upon a Survey thereof to make a Calculate, how many Men would be required to Maintain and Defend that Pass in case the Turks should endeavour to force their entrance that way into the Morea, it being of great impor∣tance to fortifie that passage, and not leave it open, and undefended to the Incursion of the Turks; whilst the Armata should be employed on other Enterprizes.
Whilst things remained under these Un∣certainties, News was brought by an Ex∣press from Salona, That Liberachi had wrote a menacing Letter to the Bayliffs and prin∣cipal Men belonging to the Villages and Parts adjacent, that they should come and pay their Respects to him,Liberachi threatens Villages near Sa∣lona. and bring their Carach, or Poll-Money with them, or o∣therwise he would come and punish them according as their Disobedience should de∣serve. To which they unanimously made Answer, That he might come when he plea∣sed, that they feared him not; and that he should find their Scimetars to be as keen, and sharp as his. Liberachi upon this An∣swer, being then at Zittuni, not far from Salona, immediately put his Troops in or∣der, and marched against them; and was boldly encountred by Charopoliti, who Commanded the Country People, and be∣ing joyned with some Troops of the Con∣federate Provinces, and of the Oltramarines, (who under the Command of Elia Damia∣novick, had deserted the Venetian Army) they joyned Battle with Liberachi, and af∣ter a Bloody Fight defeated him,He sights, and is de∣feated. and carried many of the Turks Heads to General Cornaro, who with his Gally was nearly approached to that Coast. July.But as to the Venetian Arms, all things remained still and without motion; only the Doge and Guadagne passed with some Gallies along the Shoar-side by way of the Gardens, to take necessary Observations of the Countenance of the Enemy, and Situ∣ation of the place, without coming to any certain Resolution. Howsoever at length, after long Debates, they resolved at a Council of War, (that their Arms might not remain longer unemployed) to dis-speed the Cavalry, which were to march by Land, and 3000 Foot Soldiers to be embarked on the Ships, furnished with all sorts of Pro∣visions both for Arms, and Victuals, and therewith to sail to the Streight of Corinth, to disappoint the Seraskier of all hopes of Entrance into the Morea:The Nar∣row of Co∣rinth for∣tified. The Prince Har∣court was to Command the Horse, accom∣panied with the Sergeant-General Spaar; who joyning with the Auxiliaries of that Country under the Command of Dambi, it was calculated, that they might form a Bo∣dy of about 7000 fighting Men effective; who were to be attended by Cornaro the Proveditor-General, who, with some Gal∣lies, was to assist as any occasion should oc∣cur. But whilst this Design was putting in practice, and all things prepared for the March and Voyage of the Soldiers, and some already gone, the unhappy News ar∣rived,The Plague ck. That the Plague was broken out in the Country of Propoliza, whereby the whole Army might be in danger of Conta∣gion; that being the common Way, and Road by which all the Provisions were to pass for Relief of the Army, unless they would take a compass by Sea round the Morea, which would be an uncertain and te∣dious Navigation. But His Serene Highness the Doge, having put all things in the most secure manner possible to avoid Infection, 14 Sail of Ships were dispatched for Tran∣sport of the Soldiers, on which were laden the Chevaux de Frise, with all sorts of Pro∣visions, and Ammunition for War, and Su∣stenance of the Soldiers. And that the City of Malvasia might still remain streightned by a Blockade, and as it were Besieged, the two Forts were finished, which served to keep the Defendants within the compass of their own Walls, and to hinder them from other Avenues on the side towards the Gardens,Malvasia blocked up. at that place which is called Palio Dirgo, some Regiments were ordered to raise certain Forts and Redoubts on that side, the Slaves belonging to the Gallies, which were brought as near as they could come, were employed in the Works to cast up Earth, and make Faggots; and a Squa∣dron of Gallies under Command of Pisani, was posted there to be assistant to the Regi∣ments ashoar. The Doge in the mean time removed from the Fort of St. Nicholas, which was the Old Malvasia, towards the New Forts, which being entirely compleated, four pie∣ces of great Cannon of 50 Pound Bullet were Landed, and planted on the principal Fortress, whence they greatly annoyed the Turks; howsoever the Enemy was not neg∣ligent on the other side to ply their Can∣non on that part which is nearest to the Bridge. In the mean time also the General of Malta,The Malta Gallies permitted to cruise abroad. (for whom at present there was no great Action) by permission of the Doge received license to be absent for 15 Days, and to cruise about the Cape of Sapienza, and Watch for the Corsairs of Barbary, which did commonly infest the Seas. About this time Prince Maximilian of Brunswick arrived at the Armata, where the Day following he was received with the u∣sual Ceremony by the Doge; he brought with him no more force than what served for his own Equipage, and for the better Defence of the Ship, on which he was Em∣barked: but so soon as this Prince had per∣formed his Complements,A Storm endangers the Gallies. a sudden Storm arose with Hail and Wind, so violent, as put all the Gallies into imminent danger; some lost their Boltsprits, others their Main-Yards, others had their Oars broken, some had their Poops blown away, and Boats were overturned, with such prodigious Hail,
as the like had scarce ever been seen before. In short the whole Armata was in danger of being lost; but God be praised, tho' the Escape was wonderful, yet it cost some Trou∣ble, Time, and Charges to repair the Da∣mages; in which also the Forces on Land had their share, having had their Tents and Huts overthrown by this Hurricane of Wind; only the Turks received some bene∣fit thereby, having had their Cisterns filled with the Showers of Rain and Hail, which fell like a Deluge into all the Receptacles and Vessels made to receive fresh Water for the Use and Service of this City, of which before this Accident, they began to be sen∣sible of some want. And now Letters were brought from the Forces lately sent to guard the Streight of Corinth, that the Defence and Conservation of that place, would require a 1000 Men more; which His Serene Highness being desired to dispatch away, they were with∣out any delay embarked on the Squadron of Captain Pisani, and by that time the Batteries for the Mortar-pieces being also completed,Reinforce∣ment sent to the Nar∣row of Co∣rinth. they began to throw their Bombs and Carcasses thick into the Town, which so incommoded the Defendants, that the Venetians began to conceive some hopes of a speedy Surrender, and the Forts play∣ed so constantly on the Town, to open and widen the Breaches, as if they had intend∣ed to have stormed the Walls, for which they had neither Men, nor other Preparations. Howsoever it was hoped, that by the Can∣non and Bombs only, the City might be reduced: For that a Magazine of Powder in a place called the Wind-Mill, was blown up, and by a Report received from some Deserters,The Bombs annoy the Town. the Defendants were extreamly annoyed by the Bombs; of which their greatest damage was to their Cisterns, and Conservatories of Water; by this intelli∣gence the Doge was encouraged to ply them incessantly with Bombs, not only from the Land-side, but from three Palanders, or Bomb-Ships, two of which were placed di∣rectly opposite to the City, and a third was drawn just under the Fortress to increase the Annoyance which was made by the Can∣non. The Gallies of Malta return.In the mean time at the expiration of the 14 Days allotted, the Malta Gallies return∣ed from cruising on the Coast of the Cape Sapienza, having neither met the Ships of Barbary, nor other Booty: And whereas it was represented, that these Gallies could be little serviceable at present towards the Sub∣jection and Surrender of the City, it was judged, that they might be best employed in cruising on the Pirates of Barbary, and securing the Christian Vessels which Trade in those Seas; and accordingly those Gallies were without the least delay dispatched a∣gain for the Cape Lands, which are most infested by the Pirates, being favoured by the Northern Winds, which continued for several Days,They go a∣gain to Sea. even to the end of this Month. But this Wind which was beneficial to the Gallies of Malta, was so prejudicial and dangerous to the Palanders, as put them besides all their Works and Operations; so that instead of annoying the Town, they had Business enough to save themselves from sinking in the Seas, which the Nor∣therly Winds drove violently upon them: So that now the Besiegers had nothing to annoy the Enemy, but what was thrown from the Forts erected on the Land. Things in this manner not succeeding well on the Venetian side,August. some little encou∣ragement was administred by the Arrival of the Proveditor General of the Seas,Cornaro joyns the Fleet. Gi∣rolamo Cornaro, who on the 5th of the Month of August, whilst the Doge was in person on the side of the Gardens, to invigorate, and by his presence to animate the Ap∣proaches against the Town, was discover∣ed to double the Cape of St. Angelo with two Gallies, and a Galleot, and to bend his Course directly towards the Fleet. The Arrival of Cornaro, a person of so much Honour and Esteem, generally applauded in all parts, gave wonderful satisfaction to the Fleet and Army; for tho' the Gallies and Galleot he brought with him, could not contribute much to the Reinforcement of the Armata; yet the Reputation of such a person, renowned as well for his Bravery and Conduct, as for the fame of his Family and Ancestors, gave a general Satisfaction and Confidence to all the Forces. It being observed by the Doge, that not∣withstanding all their Endeavours, no great Advancement was made on the Town, and that the Defendants continued still resolute and unterrified, and therefore that some∣thing more effectual should be attempted upon them, to force them to a Surrender: It was ordered, that four of the greatest Ships should be appointed to batter the Town with their Cannon, whilst an At∣tempt should be made to burn their Galle∣ots, Brigantines, and Londra's,Attempt to burn the Vessels of the Town▪ which were drawn up close under the Walls: To exe∣cute this Enterprize, four Boats, or Pinna∣ces armed with Stout Resolute Seamen, Commanded by Peter Ferrari, were ap∣pointed to burn the Vessels lying under the Walls, and being furnished with Fireworks, were to make an Attack on them, under the Smoak of the Cannon, which were to play on the Town from the four Ships. Things being all prepared for such an Enterprize, the Doge left his own, and mounted the Galley of Pisani, who was Captain of the Slaves condemned to the
Oar, and thereon returned to the Garden fre, to be a Spectator of the Action, know∣ing that his presence would much animate and inspire Courage into the Assailants. The next Day being the time appointed, a Body of about 100 Oltramarines, were or∣dered in the Night to hide themselves un∣der some little Hills and Rocks called Gre∣bani, and at the Foot of one of the Ene∣mies Forts, to cover the Attack in case the Turks should make a Sally from the Town. But the Success did not answer the Expecta∣tion of the Martial Spirits of so many brave Officers and Soldiers,But with∣out effect. who came down in great Numbers to behold the per∣formance of this Action; the which was absolutely defeated for want of the four Ships, which were detained below by con∣trary Winds: Howsoever the Expectation being great, the Officers on the shoar ap∣proached the Town nearer than was neces∣sary and safe, of which the Turks not neg∣lecting their Advantage, made many Shots amongst them from the Walls, one of which killed Lorenzo Venier,Venier & Carac∣cioli kil∣led. Captain Extraordina∣ry of the Ships, and Michael Angelo Carac∣cioli, a Cavalier of Malta, whilst they were both in serious Discourse together, having received the Mortal Blow on their Heads. The Death of Venier was greatly lamented not only by the Doge, but by the whole Army, and indeed the Loss was general, being one of the most able Citizens of Ve∣nice, and the best Sea Captain belonging to that Republick: And indeed it seemed, as if an unhappy Constellation had been reign∣ing over him at that time, when being de∣sirous to be aboard for better direction of the four Ships,Are great∣ly lament∣ed. the Doge permitted him not, out of a regard to his Person, which he did not think fit to adventure on so de∣sperate a hazard, so that what was intend∣ed for his Conservation, was turned to his Loss and Destruction. But this was not all the Misfortune; for the Turks observing such a Concourse of People, and from thence apprehending some intention of an Assault, made a Sally, not only from the Town,The Turks make a Sally. but from the Rocks, under which the Oltramarines had concealed themselves; where the Turks fal∣ling on them in the Rear, killed many of them, and put the rest to Flight; and tho' the Sergeant-Major Tomaso Pompei, with some of his Men,Sem Ol∣trama∣rines put to flght. came in to their Succour, he got nothing thereby more than a Mu∣sket-shot in his Thigh, after which he was forced to retreat. After which unhappy Misfortune, the Doge returned to his Ducal Gally greatly afflicted for the Death of Venier; by which the Ships wanting an Admiral, Domenico Diedo was substituted in his place, until the return of Pisani from the Gulf of Corinth. All which time the Forces sent to guard that important Pass and Narrow leading in∣to the Morea, remained there without any Action, the Seraskier not intending to make any effort thereon for that Year;The Sera∣skier keeps a Guard on Negro∣pont. for that his Eyes being fixed on Negropont, where he expected that the Venetians should re∣new their Attempt, he judged that their appearance before Malvasia, was nothing but a Blind to divert him from the guard of that important place. Things not being very promising before Malvasia, and little hopes to subdue it by force, the Doge resolved to spend the re∣mainder of the Summer in cruising in the Archipelago; but not to lose all the Fruits of the preceding Labours, the Redoubt raised at the Bridge was fortified and perfected, and the other Forts strengthned with as ma∣ny Men and Cannon, as were esteemed sufficient both to keep the Enemy from Sallying out, or Provisions from entring in; but before the Doge departed, four of the greatest Ships were ordered to batter the Town,The Ships batter the Town. and give a farewell to them with their biggest Cannon: The which being performed within Musket-shot, ruined al∣most all the Suburbs, yet not without some Loss aboard the Ships by the Enemies Small-shot from the Walls. The Preparations for securing the Block∣ade of the Town being perfected, and the Work of Careening, Washing, and Tallow∣ing of the Venetian, and Maltese Gallies being ended,Septemb. it was concluded necessary to execute the former resolution of sailing up the Archipelago, to the Gulph of Negropont, whereby the Seraskier might be alarm'd, and amused so far as to keep his Forces on that side, and without farther attempt, to pass the Streight of Corinth into the Morea; and that in the mean time all things might be secured before Malvasia, four Gallies were appointed to remain there, under the Com∣mand of Frederico Bembo, and Colonel Fabio Lanoia to maintain the first Fortress, and Co∣lonel Carlo Montanari the second, with their respective Regiments. All things being thus ordained, and a∣greed, the Doge weighed Anchor in the Night, and endeavoured to get out, but the Winds being contrary, he was forced to return back again to an Anchor; as the like happened also the next Day, not only by contrary Winds, but by some Misunder∣standings between the Vessels of the Van-Guard. But what was worse than all the former Misfortunes,The Doge sick of a Fever. the Doge was seized with such a violent Fever, as confined him to his Bed, in which the Physicians disco∣vered very dangerous Symptoms of a long Distemper. Moreover some unhappy Re∣ports
were then flying abroad, That the Cap∣tain Pasha was come out, and roving upon the Seas in the Archipelago with 14 Gallies, 31 Ships, including those of Barbary, and 18 Galleots, with design to raise Carach, or Contributions from the Islands: But no great credit was given to that Report, by reason that the Season of the Year was so far advanced, that it seemed rather time to lay up Vessels in Harbout, than to begin a new Expedition. Howsoever the News hereof, and the Distemper of the Doge in∣creasing, which the Physicians termed a Relapse, and therefore more dangerous, de∣claring also that the change of Air would be the most proper Remedy for the Disease,The Doge returns home. it was resolved, That the Charge and Com∣mand of the Fleet, should be committed to the Conduct of that Wise and Prudent Ca∣valier Cornaro the Proveditor-General of the Seas, whose Vice-Admiral was Carlo Pisani, and Rear-Admirals Bartolmeo Gredenigo, and Giovanni Pizzamano; to whom also the Gal∣ley of Ludovico Balbi designed for Dalma∣tia was joyned, together with the Gallies of Malta, which being according to the Sea∣son of the Year, recalled home; the Admi∣ral with that Squadron, sailed with the Ve∣netians, esteeming it a great Honour to ac∣company the Doge on that occasion, so far as his Way and Course would admit. In this manner the Doge, whose Illness increased, set sail the 15th of September, and directing his Course towards Venice, came the next Day in sight of Coron, and passing at no great distance from Modon, they An∣chored that Night at Prodano, and the next Day in the Road of Zant; where having remained all that Day, they Anchored the next Day in Port Viscardo upon the Island of Ceffalonia, and the following Day at Corfu. We omit all the Ceremonies which passed between the Armata, and the Officers of the several Cities, and Countries by which they sailed; as also the short stay made at Casopo, where Prayers and Money were offered at the Miraculous Image of our Lady, for the Health and Recovery of the Doge; and here it was not far from the Rock of Jasse∣no,The Gallies of Malta separate from the Fleet. that the Gallies of Malta taking their leave of the Venetian Fleet, returned to their own Country: From Casopo they came to the Entrance of Cattaro, where they had intelligence, that Alexander Molino, Prove∣ditor-General in that Province, was return∣ed from Narenta, having failed of the De∣sign he undertook in those Parts, by reason that the Morlacks had not executed his Or∣ders. On the 28th they came in sight of Ra∣gusi, from whence the Senate sent off five of their principal Gentlemen to Complement the Doge; but by reason of his Indisposi∣tion they were introduced to the Presence of the Lieutenant-General, to whom, with sensible Expressions of their Sorrow for the Indisposition of His Most Serene High∣ness,The Doge at Ragusi. they declared the great Honour and Deference they conserved for the Most Se∣rene Republick of Venice, being extreamly sorry, that they should be deprived of the satisfaction of laying themselves at the Feet of His Highness: After which they made their Presents of all sorts of Refreshments, such as Confects, Fowl, Fruit, Wax, Herbs, and Ice, with whatsoever else might be ac∣ceptable at Sea. The 1st of October they Anchored before the City and Castle of Spalato,October. the strong∣est Venetian Garrison that is on the Dalma∣tian Shoar,Spalato. commanded by Bartolmeo Grit∣ti, who with the Archbishop attended with many Followers, came to the side of the Ducal Galley, where they were received by the Lieutenant-General. And here it was thought fit to pass the Quarantene, which is observed with indispensible Rigour by all Vessels coming from the Levant; for which this being esteemed a commodious place, Orders were given for fitting and preparing the Lazaretto, and to provide it with all things necessary, and with faithful and di∣ligent Guardians. And here it was that the Doge having all things fitly accommodated for him, went ashoar to enjoy something of Repose and Rest, being much weakned by his Sickness and Fatigues of his Voyage.Octob. 3d From hence was dispatched an Express to the Senate, to give them notice, that the Doge resolved to make his Contumacia at that Place,The Doge makes his Quaran∣tene at Spalato. and was already entered into Quarantene. In answer unto which, the Senate dispatched their Ducal Letters to signifie their Pleasure, that the Doge might continue to finish his Quarantene at Spalato; to which end the Prior, and Overseers of the Health, were dispatched from Venice to take care that all things relating to that Matter, should be performed with due Care and Punctuality; and accordingly all things were inspected by them, whether of Goods or Merchan∣dize, and nothing of rigour omitted with the least respect to the Person of the Doge, or his Retinue. At the beginning of November,Novemb. News was brought to Spalato, That the Provedi∣tor-General Molino, had succeeded in his Design against Trebigne, having possessed himself in that Country of 10 Towers, of which he had demolished seven, and retain∣ed three, into which he had put some For∣ces, which might serve to incommode the Turks in their Excursions. During the time of this Quarantene, no∣thing passed at Spalato, but only Triumphs
and Festivals for the Successes of Prince Lewis of Baden against the Turks, and for the Election of Cardinal Ottoboni to the Pa∣pal Throne,They rejoyce for the Suc∣cesses of Pr. Lewis of Baden. under the Name of Alexan∣der VIII. Letters also were brought from the Ports of Malvasia, of the 4th of Octo∣ber, That the General of the Seas Cornaro, departed from thence the 23d of September, with the Gallies under his Command; ha∣ving left four Gallies behind for Guards un∣der Rear-Admiral Bembo, and 10 Ships un∣der Marco Pisani; and that since the Depar∣ture of the Doge, about 30 Persons had made their escape out of Malvasia, declar∣ing the great Misery which was in the City, besides the raging Diseases of Fluxes and Convulsions. In performance of the Quarantene the Month of November passed, and an entrance made into the Month of December, by which the Doge being returned to a better State of Health,The Prat∣cick given to the Doge. and all the Gallies well refresh∣ed, and in a good Condition, and supplied with Provisions, come from Venice; and all things put into a Posture for Sailing; Prattica was given to the whole Fleet, (that is, a License of Converse and Communica∣tion) by the Officers of Health; and next Day being the 17th of December,Decemb. Anchors were weighed, and the Doge proceeded on his Voyage towards Venice, where he arri∣ved about the end of this Month; with which the Year expiring,The Doge departs from Spa∣lato, and arrives at Venice. we shall not need to describe the glorious Reception of the Doge into the Palace of St. Mark, with all the Pomp and Magnificence which the Riches, and fervent affection of this cele∣brated City, and Wise Senate could confer on a Prince so famous and deserving as this: And so let us proceed to the following Year. Anno 1690. 1690. January.THUS far had the Affairs of Christen∣dom succeeded prosperously against the Turks; for tho' the Venetians had for the two last Years performed no great Feats, yet the Imperial Arms under the Conduct of Prince Lewis of Baden, had been Pro∣sperous even to a Miracle; but now the German Empire being furiously Attacked within the Bowels of it by the Arms of France, there was a necessity to look home∣wards, and for the several Princes to pro∣vide for their own Safety, and guard their own Countries, for which reason many of the German Troops being called out of Hungary, the main Burden of the War fell upon the Emperor, and was carried on with va∣rious Success, tho' for the most part Pro∣sperous, whilst his Affairs were under the Auspicious Government of that Valiant and Renowned General Prince Lewis of Baden. This Month of January began not very favourably on the Christian side; for the Prince of Holstein hearing that the Turks miserably destroyed the Countries round about, he marched to Prisseren, with some Troops to meet them, and thence, not being able to spare many Forces, he detached the Prince of Hanover, and Colonel Strasser, to relieve the Pass of Casseneck, which was said to be Besieged by the Turks: On the the 1st of January, when they decamped from before Prisseren or Prissina, their Troops consisted of 120 Foot, drawn from the Re∣giment of Aspremont; 80 of Aversperg's, five Companies of Dragoons of the Prince of Hanover's Regiment, eight Troops of Horse of Holstein, six Troops of Horse of Hanover, four Troops of Horse of the Re∣giment of Stirum; all which did not a∣mount unto more than 1600 Men, with which they marched so diligently, that the next Day they arrived near Casseneck, in sight of the Enemy; their Orders were not to approach too near, nor advance too far, until they had well observed the true strength of the Enemy, and discovered whether they were so strong as had been reported: Accordingly they at first posted themselves with their Backs to a Morass, and planted four Field-Pieces against the Enemy, who durst not Attack them in that Place; but keeping within the Hills and Woods, they detached 1000 Tartars into the open Fields, upon sight of which, Colonel Stras∣ser quitting his Advantageous Post, forced them to retreat with the Death of some of them; but the Germans being now in the open Field, and not able to retreat, they found themselves surrounded on all sides with 30000 of the Enemy, against which having sustained a Battle from Nine in the Morning, till Three in the Afternoon,The Ger∣mans de∣feated. and having spent all their Powder and Ammuni∣tion, they were at last totally defeated. In this Fight the Prince of Hanover, Colo∣nel Strasser, Count Solari, with most of the Officers, and many of the Common Soldiers were killed on the Place, most of the Prisoners being wounded, died; all their Colours, Kettle-Drums, &c. were taken by the Enemies; nevertheless 6 or 700 Men, by help of the Night, and of Woods and Mountains, came safe to Bel∣grade, from whence they were dispatched to their Regiments. This News being brought the same Night to the Prince of Holstein unto Prissi∣na, he retreated from thence to Nissa, lea∣ving behind all the Forage and Baggage of the Regiment of Stirum.
On the 4th the Regiment of Piccolomini, which was to joyn with Strasser, having no Advice of the Defeat, came near to Casse∣neck,Count Monte∣celli At∣tacked by the Tar∣tars. under the Command of Lieutenant-Colonel Count Montecelli, so soon as he came in sight of the Tartars, they immediately Invested him, but he very prudently re∣treated towards a Morass, over which there was a Bridge; on the other side whereof he commanded a Lieutenant with 30 Horse to guard that end of the Bridge, until he put himself in a Posture to fight on the other side. After some time the Tartars Attacked them on both sides, the Lieutenant with 30 Men defended himself for a good while; until being over-powered, he was relieved by two Companies sent to his Assistance,He makes his Escape with some loss. and on both sides defended themselves so valiantly until Night, that under shelter of the Darkness, they made their Retreat; the Tartars followed them with great noise for the space of an Hour, but could not put them into disorder; so about Midnight, they arrived at Prissina, which Place they found Abandoned; but having refreshed themselves and their Horses there for a while, they proceeded to Procopia with the loss only of about 30 Men, and one Cap∣tain and some wounded, their Baggage was not with them, they having sent it to Poza, and Novibassa, which afterwards fell into the Hands of the Enemy, with most of those which accompanied it, the rest saved themselves in the Woods. By this time Veterani who was appoint∣ed General in the Place of Piccolomini de∣ceased, arrived at Nissa from Transilvania, with some Troops; which being a Place o∣pen to the Attack of the Enemy, and much feared, they caused the Garrison and Inha∣bitants to work Night and Day upon the Fortifications; Veterani also provided Py∣rot, Procopia, Mustapha Palanca, being Pas∣ses, with all Necessaries, and demolished Cossova, Albania, and some other little Pla∣ces, from whence he withdrew the Soldiers to strengthen Places of greater moment. Casseneck surrendred.The Pass Casseneck which was Besieged, (wherein was a Garrison of 180 Men) and before which the Turks had raised a Battery of seven Guns, defended it self several Days, and at length surrendred on Conditi∣ons, one of which was that they should be conducted to Belgrade. Whilst things were acting on this side, Colonel Corbelli, who commanded the Block∣ade of great Waradin, received Advice that the Turks at Bellingesh had provided a great Number of Cattle, and 100 Waggons with Provisions, under a strong Convoy, to be put into Waradin for relief of the City, whereupon making a Detachment of 200 Horse, 300 Dragoons, 300 Hussars, and 200 Heydukes, he marched therewith to∣wards Bellingesh; but those of the Place having received early notice hereof from Waradin,Corbelli destroys the Palanca if Bellin∣gest. withdrew all their Provisions in∣to the Castle; so that the original Design of Corbelli was defeated, yet not to return empty, he stormed and entered the Palanca, where after the Slaughter of several Turks, he plundered, and carried away every thing that was in it: He could not Attack the Castle which was well fortified, for want of Cannon; and therefore having destroyed the Palanca, with the Gardens thereabouts, he returned back with good Booty. On the 15th Tekeli with his Men, and 2000 Turks, arrived near Oraviza, with a design to Attack Temeswaer; but he miscar∣ried therein, and was forced to retreat. On the other side the Governor of Lip∣pa, Captain Christopher Morris, with Cap∣tain Baltasar, having under them 100 Hus∣sars, 100 Horse of Heisler's, and 100 Dra∣goons, marched towards Temeswaer, with design to surprize some Turks in the Villa∣ges thereabouts, but meeting with none, they proceeded until they came in sight of the City; leaving the greatest part of their Troops in Ambuscade at some distance from them: Upon their Approach, the Turks sal∣lied out with Horse and Foot, and posted themselves in a hollow Way, where the Germans, under the cover of a Mist or Fog, attacked them, the Hussars falling upon their Horse,The Ger∣mans get an Advan∣tage. and the Dragoons on the Jani∣zaries, with such bravery, that they put them to flight; after having killed above 300 on the Place, and taken several Priso∣ners, and having only four Men killed, and nine wounded, they retired back again to Lippa. About this time 50 Soldiers having de∣serted the Service of Tekeli, took the Oaths of Fidelity to the Emperor, and were sent to Prissina to recruit the Garrison of that Pass, consisting of some Imperial, and Ras∣cian Troops. These Deserters gave Intelli∣gence to General Veterani, that Sultan Galga the Tartar, was designed in a few Days to joyn with Tekeli, and to make an Invasion into Transilvania; upon which, Orders were given to work on the Fortifications on the Frontiers, with all diligence: And now Ad∣vices came to Nissa, That the Turks had burnt Uranic, with all the Villages round that Place; as also Cossova, and the adja∣cent Places near to Prissina; but some little time before this piece of Execution was performed, the Turks had allured the poor Peasants, with their Wives and Children,The Tar∣tars bar∣barous U∣sage of the poor People. to return from the Woods and Mountains, to their own Dwellings, where they promised them Quietness, Protection, and Safety; but the Tartars not having been concerned in
this Guaranty, the poor People were no sooner returned to their Habitations, but they were barbarously attacked by the Tar∣tars, who killed all the Old Men and Wo∣men, and carried away the Young of both Sexes into Captivity: After this unhamane Butchery Sultan Galga retreated with most of his Hords to Sophia, and thence by way of Nicopolis he made all the haste possible to return for Budziack, because he had recei∣ved Advices,They return to Budzi∣ack. That the Moscovites with a very numerous Army, were on the Fron∣tiers, ready to Invade his Country; but his March was not so hasty, but that he had time, after the Tartarian Fashion, to de∣stroy the Province of Schnepoli; and to kill, and assassinate all the Country People that they met; and tho' this Retreat of the Tartars was Unfortunate to these poor Wretches, yet thereby General Veterani was delivered from his Apprehensions for Nissa; which was howsoever labouring un∣der great want of Ammunition, and Pro∣vision of all sorts; and how to supply them was not as yet resolved.Nissa in want of Provisions. For tho' the Coun∣try of Schnepoli had engaged to furnish Nis∣sa with a good quantity of all sorts of Pro∣visions, yet being now burnt and destroyed by the Tartars; and the remainder of what was left pillaged by the Turks, there could be no expectation of any supply from thence: And as to what was to be convey∣ed to them from Belgrade, by reason of the Winter Weather, Snows, and tired Cattle, came so slowly over the Mountains, that General Veterani, and the other chief Offi∣cers, had Abandoned the Place, had not some Horses at the very instant arrived at Nissa with 50 Waggons,February. all laden with Provisions and Ammunition, together with four Pieces of Cannon which had been ta∣ken out of the Fort of Jagodina, and great Quantities of Flour, and Oats, much more of which was daily expected, by which Stores, tho' Nissa was abundantly relieved, yet the Fortifications proceeded more slowly than was fit for a Frontier Garrison, expo∣sed to the main and chief Power of the Enemy. Canisia i∣clining to capitulate.Thus things stood at Nissa, when the Blockade of Canisia was so narrowly watch∣ed and observed, that the Garrison began to be reduced to the utmost Extremity; so that the People would have forced the Pasha to Capitulate; but he remaining resolute to endure the last Extremity, perswaded them with Presents, and fair Words, to a longer Patience: But the Inferiour and Subaltern Officers not enduring longer, dispatched a Messenger, (without making the Pasha, or Janizar-Aga privy to their Design) with Letters to the Grand Vizier, desiring that he would either take some Measures for the Relief of the Place, or to send his Orders to the Pasha for the Surrender thereof; but this Express was not got far from the Town, before he was overtaken, brought back and Executed; but such was the Mi∣sery in the Town, that he who could escape, got out, amongst which was a Turkish Imaum, or Priest, and an Arabian Jew, who reported, That about Palm-Sunday, the Ci∣ty would Capitulate, which afterwards pro∣ved true accordingly. In the mean time the Croats made an In∣vasion into Bosnia, burnt Kazaraz,Places ta∣ken and burnt. and took some Hundreds of small and great Cattle: Howsoever in their Retreat being pursued by the Turks of Bannialuca, and Attacked by them near the Save, some of the Cattle were recovered, several of their Men kil∣led, 15 Prisoners, and five Horses taken. And about the same time the Governour of Novi having gotten together a small Bo∣dy of Men drawn out of that Garrison, and that of Zim, made an Incursion into the Enemies Country, where he burnt O∣strovitz, Ztergarick the Little, and the Great Badick, with Houses belonging to Gentlemen in the Country, in which Ex∣pedition they killed about 200 of the Ene∣my, took 76 Prisoners, 100 Head of Cat∣tle, 32 Horses, and much other Booty, and all this with the loss of one Man killed, and 10 wounded. In revenge hereof,March. the Turks of Novi-Porto, Attacked with a strong Party, some German Horse, as they were Foraging a∣broad, but were so warmly received by Bru∣mati the Governour of Lescoviza, and with such Valour, that the Turks were put to the Rout, and forced to fly, leaving 20 of their Men dead on the Place. Whilst Matters thus passed with various Successes, there were some Fears of the Constancy and Steadiness of the Rascians towards the Emperor, but those Apprehen∣sions were soon taken away by Antonio their Captain, who being sent by General Veterani, to take a View of all the Passes round about, reported at his return, That he had met within the Pass of Prissina, with one Haram Bassa,The Rasci∣ans faith∣ful to the Emperor. who in the Name of all the Inhabitants of Colossi, Moloch, Letaner, and Gaas, had assured him of the Faith and Allegiance of those People to the Emperor, having refused the Protection of the Turks, which had been offered to them: And here∣of they soon gave a Testimony by an As∣sault they had made on a Party of 500 Turks, under the Command of the Pasha of Ostrolub, in their March towards the Castle of Zwetsey, situate in the Pass of Bosna, of which they killed 60 Men, took four Pri∣soners, and 90 Horses, of which 30 were laden with Flour, besides a great Booty of
other things. On the other side Mahomet Pasha roved round about the Country of Novi Passar, burning and destroying all the remaining Villages, killing the Country People that they met with, and acting all the Cruelties that Fire and Sword could ex∣ecute. But what was of most importance at this time, was the Surrender of the strong City and Fortress of Canisia, having been redu∣ced thereunto by Famine, after a long and severe Blockade, by which being brought to such Extremities, that not being able to support themselves any longer, the Pasha on the 16th of March, sent out two Aga's to the Christian Army to treat with the Commanders of the Blockade, who were Count Adam Bathiani, and Count Stephen Zitchi:Canisia treats. to whom being conducted by Lieu∣tenant Colonel Pisterski, after the usual Complements had been passed on both sides, the Turks desired that four Weeks might be granted them to make their Surrender; of∣fering in case no Succours came to them within that time, they would then resign the City into the Hands of the Emperor's Generals, with all the Cannon and Ammu∣nition therein, (four Guns only excepted) which they pretended to carry with them: But in regard it was then late in the Evening, when these Offers were delivered, the Mes∣sengers were kept all Night in the Camp, and well treated; and the next Morning a Council of War being called, an Answer was returned them to this Effect. That it being well known,Answer to the Garri∣son of Ca∣nisia. that neither in four Weeks, nor in four Years, any Relief, or Succour could be expected for them; and that tho' their Extremities were so e∣vident, that they were certainly assured they could not subsist any longer, yet that they might taste of the Grace and Cle∣mency of the Emperor, they promised them their Lives, (provided they should Surrender themselves in the space of 24 Hours:) With which Answer the two Aga's returned back to the City, on which some Consultation being there had on the 19th, three Turks were sent out again to the Christian Army, declaring to the Ge∣nerals, in the Name of the Pasha and the Garrison; That tho' they were still fur∣nished with four Months Provision in the Town, yet they would no longer refuse the Clemency of His Imperial Majesty, but deliver up the City unto him. And for the further management of this Trea∣tise, they proposed, That three German and Hungarian Officers might be sent into the Town for Hostages,Hostages given. in lieu of five Turks, who should be employed to Capitu∣late in the Army. The Christians having assented hereunto, the three Messengers were next Day returned with this An∣swer. That the Clemency of His Impe∣rial Majesty was such, that he never desi∣red to shed the Blood of his Enemies, when they implored his Mercy; and that the General Bathiani had full Power to pardon them, which he was ready to do, on Condition that they Surrendred the Place in the space of 24 Hours. With this Answer the Turks returning to the Town, they desired a third Conference on the 21st; the which, after a long Dispute, was granted, and agreed, That five Turks, of which the Janizar-Aga should be one, should come into the Camp; and that in the Place of them, a German and two Hun∣garian Officers should be sent for Pledges into the City. This being performed on the 22d Day, these following Capitulations were agreed and signed. Capitulations Agreed. I. THAT whatsoever is belonging to the Arsenal, and Publick Stores, either of Provision, Ammunition, Can∣non, or other Arms should be delivered to the Imperial Commissaries, to whom also all Mines made about the City should be discovered. II. That the Prisoners on both sides, should be released without Ransom. III. That all the Inhabitants of the City, and Strangers, shall have liberty to march out with their Arms, Move∣ables, Cloaths, Servants, Children, Hor∣ses, and all other Cattle, who shall have safe Passage, and Conduct into the Otto∣man Dominions, but without Flying Co∣lours, or Sound of Drum: Notwith∣standing which, in case any of the Rasci∣ans who are in pay of the Turks, should freely desire to come over to the Christi∣ans, they shall not be hindered, either on the Score of Debt, or any other Pretence whatsoever. IV. All Christian Renegadoes, who shall be desirous to return unto their An∣cient Faith, shall have liberty to do it, and no Christian Children be privately conveyed away. V. A sufficient Number of Waggons, shall be allowed to the Turks to carry them to the Water-side, and from thence Boats to Transport them into the Turkish Domi∣nions. VI. That so soon as these Capitulati∣ons shall be Signed, the Imperialists shall immediately be put into Possession of the Palanca, our Out-work, called Baschlar Kapoesi; in which the Turks shall have li∣berty to sell what they please of their Goods, or to carry them away. VII. That so soon as the Imperial Ra∣tification shall be returned, the Turks shall immediately quit the City, and be∣gin their Journey. VIII. The Turks shall deliver to the Imperial Commissaries all the Tax-Regi∣sters in Canisia, with such Books as con∣cern the Military Sallaries paid from Bos∣nia, and other Districts depending on Ca∣nisia, with the Tefter, or an account of such Revenues which the Janizaries usual∣ly Pay, and Receive out of the Homage, and Tributary Countries. IX. That the People of Canisia shall be Convoyed with a sufficient Number of Officers and Soldiers, unto the first Tur∣kish Fortress, leaving howsoever behind them the Hostages at the last Christian Fortress, until the return of the Con∣voy. X. That during the March Provisions shall be furnished to the Turks at moderate Prices. With these Capitulations, the Imperial Councellor of War, called Pozo, the Aga, and two more Turkish Officers, were on the 24th dispatched to Vienna to have the Ca∣pitulations Ratified and Signed with the Imperial Firme;The Empe∣ror ratifies the Treaty. they arrived on the 30th, and the next Day had an Audience of Count Staremberg, President of the Council of War, to whom they delivered the Capitula∣tion;April. and on the first of April it was re∣turned back again to them Signed by the Emperor, who was graciously pleased to make a Present therewith unto the Aga, of a Watch set with Diamonds. With this Ratification the Aga being re∣turned, which was on the 3d of April, it was resolved by the Pasha, and other Offi∣cers in the Divan, immediately to put the Christians into Possession of one of the Gates of the City;The Town surrendred. the which by the 12th, they fully quitted; and the next Day the Pasha being on Horseback, attended with some Turks on Foot, delivered unto General Bathyani the Keys of the Town in a gild∣ed Bason hanging on a Gold Chain. The Pasha indeed expected, that the General should have alighted from his Horse to re∣ceive them, but the General refusing to receive them in such a manner, as a Conde∣scention too inferiour to the Dignity of His Imperial and Victorious Master, the Pasha insisted no farther thereupon, but present∣ing the Key, said, I deliver unto you the Key of a Fortress, the like whereof there is none in all the Turkish Empire. This being done, the General went into the City to visit the Fortifications, and af∣terwards entertained the Pasha, the Aga of the Janizaries, and Zorbagee Aga at Din∣ner, with some others. Then the Garrison marched out, consisting of 600 Turks, which with the Inhabitants, made in all 4000 Souls; the which were conducted in∣to the Dominions of the Turks, according to the Capitulation. It seems that this strong City was sur∣rendred rather by Divisions amongst them∣selves, than for want of Provisions:The Cannon and Am∣munition and Provi∣sions taken therein. On the Walls were mounted 56 Brass, and 10 Iron Cannon, the most part of them made in the time of the Emperors Maximilian I. and II, and of Charles V, and Ferdinand I. In the Magazine, or Store-house under the Governor's Palace, were found 1540 Mus∣quets, and in the Arsenal 2200 more, with much Lead, Cannon, and Musquet-Bullets, Swords, Granadoes, with all sorts of Arms and Warlike Instruments in great abun∣dance. Canisia, or Canisa, is situate on a River towards the Frontiers of Styria, near the Drave, and not far from the Fort Serin; it is so environed on all sides with a Morass, or Marsh, that no Army can lie near it,The Situa∣tion of Ca∣nisia. which renders the Town almost impregnable, and inaccessible, notwithstanding it was taken by the Turks in the Year 1600. The next Year following Mathias Arch-Duke of Austria Besieged it in the Month of September, but was forced to retire after a Siege of two Months. In the Year 1664, at the beginning of it, in the Month of January, Count Serini, by favour of the Frosts, which gave him some Footing on the Morass, after he had taken Quinque Ecclesiae, and some other Places, and had burnt Sighet, he besieged Canisia, which he had infallibly taken, if they had sent him the Succours which were promi∣sed him; but as I have related in my for∣mer History, so great a Faction was against him at the Imperial Court, that they were not willing to see him prosperous, but chose rather to Sacrifice the Publick Welfare to Private Animosities; but the expected Re∣cruits not arriving at the appointed time, and the Year coming on, the Ice was Thawed, and the Great Vizier advan∣cing with a Powerful Army, the Count Sereni being under all these Discourage∣ments,
was forced to raise his Siege and be gone. General Veterani in the mean time whilst things were thus acting at Canisia, being much streightned for want of Provisions, or∣dered the Garrisons of Lescowitz and Pyroth, to make Incursions into the Turkish Terri∣tories,Incursions made into several places. which they performed so effectual∣ly, that they returned back with more than 1000 Head of Cattle; the which being di∣vided amongst the Regiments, such as were sit for the Slaughter were killed, and the rest employed for drawing the Waggons la∣den with Ammunition and Provisions. On the other side the Turks surprized a Village near Belgrade, which they Plunder∣ed and Burnt, killing, or carrying away Captives all the Inhabitants of the Place.Some Skir∣mishes. But the Garrison of Pyroth being much animated with their late Success, made ano∣ther Incursion, as far as within three Leagues of Philippopolis, burning the Villages, and killing the Turks which they met in their way; but at length being pursued by 1000 Turks, they drew themselves up into good order, and posting themselves advantage∣ously on the rising of a Hill, they engaged the Enemy for two Hours space;The Turks worsted. during which time, 30 Turks were killed, and ma∣ny wounded, and 28 Prisoners taken, with which and some Hundreds of Cattle, they re∣turned safe to Pyroth. In like manner 100 Germans and some Hussars belonging to the Garrison of Zolnock, encountred a Party of 160 Turks, and Male-contents, which be∣longed to Giula, and having engaged them, they killed 20 of them, took 60 Prisoners, of which 16 were of the Male-contents, the remainder throwing themselves into the Ri∣ver, were for the most part drowned. During this Season of the Year, before the Grass was sufficiently grown, no other Actions passed, but only by Parties sent abroad to surprize Cattle, and burn Villa∣ges. Amongst the rest, a Party of Rascians having roved over the Country of Schnepoli, returned back to Nissa with a Booty of se∣veral Hundred Head of Cattle, and some Yoaks of Oxen, taken near to Sophia; the which Successes still attending the Imperial Arms, the Country People on all sides of∣fered to embrace the Imperial Party, and implore their Protection so soon as the Christian Army should take the Field. On the other side Mahomet Bagavitz Pa∣sha, who had some time quietly Quartered at Poza, (having left 1500 Men for Garri∣son in that Place) he marched out with a Party of about 4000 Men, towards the Pass of Bosnia, but having in his March received Intelligence, That Captain Antonio attended him in the way, and was ready to receive him, returned and marched towards Bagnia, from whence also by reason of the great Snows, he was forced to retreat back to Poza, without any Action. Little more was acted now, as we have faid but by Parties, of which Kathana Pasha commanding one, he made an Incursion therewith into the Neighbourhood of Py∣roth, where he took several straggling Hus∣sars. Another Party of Hungarians to the Number of about 20, commanded by that Valiant Hungarian Captain, called Baudi, which had made a bold Incursion, and roved about 14 Days beyond Sophia, near to Philip∣popolis; were at length attacked by a strong Body of Turks, with which having fought for a considerable time, were at last over∣powered, and all of them cut off, (two only excepted) who made their Escape to Nissa. On the other side a Party from Belgrade surprized a Body of Turks,Several small Par∣ti cen∣gage. the most of which they killed, or took Prisoners. Like∣wise a Party of Rascians made an Excursion as far as Bagnia in Bosnia, where they kil∣led 20 Turks, and took 12 Prisoners, with 400 Head of Cattle: Besides which, those who guarded the Blockade of Great Wara∣dine, beat a Party of the Enemy, brought home 11 Heads, and eight Prisoners. Ano∣ther Party of 500 Hussars, and 40 German Dragoons, made a Sally out of Sclavonia under the Command of Lieutenant Bonidu, and passed the Save; and having in their way an Information that the Turkish Garri∣son belonging to the strong Fortress of Teockzach was fallied abroad, having only left eight Men, and 15 Women therein; they attacked and entered the Fort early in the Morning, with the loss of six of their Men killed, and eight wounded; of the Turks, four of the eight, with the Women, saved themselves in a Tower, from whence the Women threw Fire, and Stones, and hot scalding Water, but at length were forced to surrender, and leave the Place to the mercy of the Enemy, in which they found a good Booty of Turkish Horses, and other rich Goods, and therewith repassed the Save, having left four Troops of Heydukes for defence of the Place. The Season of the Year being now far advanced towards the Summer, and things preparing for greater Action; the German Officers were very intent, and studious in what manner to conserve Nissa;May for which they had great reason to be apprehensive, for that according to the Reports of all those who lately came from Adrianople, and of such Deserters who came out from the Turkish Quarters;Nissa pro∣vided. the Turks were become much more numerous than the last Year, and were marching on purpose to make Nissa the first Atchievement and Design of
their Conquest. But what could be done for Conservation of that Place, was not o∣mitted; all the Old Works were repaired, and several New ones compleated; and the River Morava being with much Expence and Labour made Navigable, great Quan∣tities of Provisions, and Materials necessa∣ry for War were brought down by that Wa∣ter to Nissa, so that nothing was wanting for Conservation of the Place, unless a greater Garrison within, and a more nume∣rous Army without. About this time a small sort of Venomous Flies swarmed about Nissa, which killed ma∣ny Horses, Cattle, Camels, and Mules. I remember in a Journey I once made through those Countries in the Month of May, that we were much infested with this sort of A∣nimals, which was the smallest Fly that e∣ver I did see, covered with a thin Fluff, or Down; the which would not touch the Flesh of a Man,Small poy∣sonous Flies but Horses, Camels, Mules, &c. were killed by them. Wheresoever they fixed on the Sides of a Horse, or any other Part, they would draw a Blister as big as an Egg; and entering into the No∣strils, immediately poisoned the Brain, which caused a sudden Death to the Beast; but hereof I have discoursed more at large in a former History, to which I refer the Reader. Tho' the great Armies were not as yet in the Field, yet Parties were roving in all Parts and Places, the Weather becoming moderate according to the Season, and the Grass grown; the Turks encamped near Gradisca, where they staid a while in ex∣pectation of some Troops to joyn with them, and therewith to pass the Save into Sclavonia, with no other Design than to ruine and spoil the Country; but Baron Koniseck having Advice thereof, marched from Brod, with all the Hussars, and Heydukes which were Quartered in the adjacent Villages un∣to a Place where the River is fordable, and therefore the most likely place where they might design to pass; by which not only the Passage of the Turks was obstructed, but News coming to them that the Croats were fallen in∣to their Country on the other side, they quit∣ted their first Design, and marched to oppose the Croats, who were too quick for them, ha∣ving taken great Booty, and committed a vast Spoil before the Turks could come in to the Succour of their Country. About the same time one Herlniovich, a Dalmatian Captain, marched six Days Jour∣ney beyond Nissa into the Enemies Coun∣try, which he Surprized and Plundered, and returned back with the Heads of several Turks, and some Prisoners. The same Cap∣tain soon afterwards having recruited him∣self with some more Troops, fell upon Berkowitz, in which was a Garrison of a∣bout 127 Turks, provided with all things necessary for defence of the Place, being fortified on a very advantageous Situation,Berke∣witz taken by a Cap∣tain of Dalmatia. but coming upon them by Surprize, the Place was taken, and all the Men put to the Sword, except some few, who made their Escape; the Booty was considerable, besides 90 Turkish Women, four Standards, and two pair of Kettle-Drums. In like manner a Captain of the Garrison of Pyroth roving abroad, and seeking his Fortune, met near to Sophia with 20 Hor∣ses laden with Nails, Iron, and several Warlike Instruments, he seized them all, and killed 19 Turks, and took one Prisoner alive, who in the Night making his Escape, gave Intelligence thereof to Sophia, from whence a Party being commanded out, they overtook the Germans, and fought with them, but the Germans behaved themselves so well, that they forced the Turks to leave them, and suffer them to escape with the Booty they had gained. At this time also some Sea Robbers land∣ed in the Bay of Vola,Sea Rob∣bers Land. and made an Incur∣sion into the Territories of Macedonia near Monassir, burning and spoiling all the Coun∣try; whilst another Party of them, to the number of about 600 Men, made a Sal∣ly towards Stippo, where they surprized 500 Turks, and put them all to the Sword, with∣out Quarter given to any one; but the In∣habitants they carried away Prisoners, and made use of them for Slaves in the Hills and Mountains. Nor were things more quiet in Hungary, where several Skirmishes happened to the Loss and Damage of the Turks; and parti∣cularly the Soldiers of the Garrison, and those of the Blockade had an Encounter, and the latter returned Victorious, with 16 Prisoners, 22 Heads, 49 Horses, and some Cattle. Moreover Count Corbelli sent out a Par∣ty of 500 Horse, which met, and surround∣ed a Party of Turks, of which they killed three or four of the Chief Commanders, with 70 private Soldiers, took 10 Priso∣ners, and many Horses; in which Action 12 Men were slain and wounded, and 22 Horses killed. Moreover 3000 Rascians under the Com∣mand of Captain Antonio, and 200 Ger∣mans under Rusbach, a Captain of Hanover, arrived one Morning about Break of Day near Bernia;Bernia surpriv'd by the Christi∣ans. from which a Detachment being made of five Troops of Rascians, with some German Musqueteers; having their Van-Guard led by Artusser Adjutant-General of Piccolomini, and three Lieute∣nants, pushed forward into the City with∣out any Halt or Hesitation, or regard to the Troops which followed, with such
Courage and Valour, that the Turks being surprized, not having time to gather them∣selves into an Orderly Body in the open Market-place; and seeing the Enemy al∣ready in the City, and more Troops follow∣ing them, the Pasha, with about 200 of his best Horse, fled out of the opposite Gate, leaving the remainder of the Garrison with the Inhabitants, which consisted of about 3000 Men to their own Fate, which ended with the Death of about 1700 of them, most whereof were killed Sleeping on their Beds; tho Booty taken, was very conside∣rable, besides much Cattle, and 500 good Horses, with the loss only on the Christian side of seven Germans, and 17 Rascians, who were killed. It being now towards the end of May, which is the usual Season for Armies to take the Field, News was brought to Nissa, that Kuperlee the Grand Vizier,The Grand Vizier marches to the Camp at Nico∣polis. was de∣camped from before Adrianople with 20000 Men, and on his March to joyn with 40000 more, which were Encamped at Nicopolis with intention to attack at one and the same time both Nissa and Widin; and where∣as the Turkish Army was in great want of Artillery, by reason of the many Cannon which they had lost during this War, the French furnished them with 100 Pieces, which were brought from France, and Land∣ed at Galata, and thence conducted on Car∣riages to the Army. But the Season not being as yet come for pitched Battles, or Siege of Towns, the Armies not being gathered into a Body, General Corbelli,June. who Commanded the Blockade near Great Waradine, detached 220 Germans and Hungarians; with design to attack the Palanca of Bellanasch, where coming to it before Break of Day, and find∣ing no Centinels to observe their Appear∣ance, all the People being asleep with the greatest Security imaginable, the Soldiers climbed the Walls, and unperceived enter∣ed the Place without any opposition what∣soever,The Palan∣ca of Bel∣lanasch surprized and taken. killing Men, Women and Children, without any distinction; some Turks how∣soever escaped, and saved themselves in the Castle; which General Corbelli being desi∣rous to take, by reason that the People of Great Waradine had been frequently relie∣ved from thence, he sent for 500 Men more to reinforce his Troops; but before these could come up to joyn, the others laden with Booty and Spoil, were departed, and gone to secure what they had gained. These two late Successes by Surprize, a∣nimated the Governour of Lescowitza, and Count Montecelli Captain of Horse in the Regiment of General Hoffkirchen, to at∣tempt a third, and joyning with them a Party of Germans and Rascians, they march∣ed to Noviporto, with intention to surprize it, in the same manner as the others had been; but some of the Rascians having Friends and Relations in the Place,A D gn on Novi∣porto dis∣covered. gave information to those within; upon which they all retired into the Castle, which was well defended with a strong Tower, and a good Wall, and with Provision sufficient for some Weeks, and stood upon their Guard; so that the Party finding their De∣sign defeated, fell upon the Cattle which were feeding near the Place, and carried a∣way some of them, to the Number of 6000 Sheep, and 2000 other Cattle; but the Turks of the Country gathering themselves into a Body, pursued after them in such Numbers, that attacking the Rascians in the Rear, they recovered most of their Cattle, and took some of their Horses; howsoever the Rascians carried off about 1000 Head of Cattle, and some Prisoners, with the Heads of 15 Turks, which they had kil∣led. The Germans still continued to rove about the Country with Parties, returning most commonly with Success; one of them sur∣prized and took Uhicza and Dobran, two small Palanca's, killing all that they found alive therein. Likewise Captain Schenchendorff with 800 Germans, and some Hungarians, passing near Radimir, a Turkish Garrison, in hopes to surprize it, found the Turks vigilant and ready to receive him; upon which being forced to make a Retreat, the Turks sallied out upon them, but were repulsed with the loss of 50 of their Men killed, and three taken Prisoners, upon which the Turks be∣ing put to flight,Radimir abandoned by the Turks. the Germans pursued them so close, that they entered with them into the Suburbs, which consisting of about 400 Houses, they burnt all to the Ground, and then retired towards Pyroth; but in their way meeting with 400 fresh Hungarian Horse, they joyned with them, and return∣ed again towards Radimir; but in their March having received Advice, That the Turks had abandoned the Town, and laden their Wives, Children, and Goods, on 130 Waggons, and sent them farther into the Country, a Party of Hussars was com∣manded to pursue them; which they did, and soon came up with them, and took all the Waggons, People, and Goods that were in them; but they were not so easily carried off, as they were taken; for a Bo∣dy of about 1200 Turks from the Frontiers, coming in to their Assistance, they not on∣ly retook all the Booty from the Hussars,A Booty taken from the Hus∣sars. (the Captain Schenchendorff being at too far a distance to relieve them) but also forced them to fly, leaving some of their Compa∣nions, who were the worst mounted, unto
the Mercy of the Enemy; after which, the Turks pursuing farther, fell in with Schen∣chendorff, who finding himself over-match∣ed, made a handsome Retreat to a conve∣nient place,They Rally and Kill some Turks. where taking his Advantage, made Head against the Turks, and killed a∣bove 100 of them, took several of their Horses, and much Cattle, which they car∣ried off with them. General Corbelli who commanded the Blockade before Great Waradin, made an Incursion with 2000 Men, and ruined all the Corn and Fruit of the Field, so near the City, as was within reach of their Guns: Upon which Approach the Garrison sallied out,A Sally made out of Great Waradin. but were repulsed with great loss, and amongst the rest the Chiaus-Bashee was killed: The Defendants terrified herewith, above 40 Families escaped out, and at their Request were Baptized. In the mean time a stricter Watch than ever was kept in the Blockade about the Castle of Bellanasch; and the Stream of Wa∣ter which ran at the Foot of the Palanca, and Castle, by which both were supplied, being cut off by the Christians, and the Currant turned another way, the Defen∣dants were reduced to great Extremities, and more especially they began to be af∣frighted, when they saw a fresh supply of Horse, Dragoons, and Hussars, ready to attack the Place, and that two Batteries were already raised, which continued firing for two Days without intermission, they at length inclined to a Surrender, and in order thereunto sent out two Aga's to make their Capitulations, which were soon concluded, and agreed, That the Garrison consisting of 150 Men,The Castle of Bella∣nasch sur∣rendred. besides their Wives and Chil∣dren, and other Inhabitants, should the next Day be conveyed to Giula, which was accordingly performed on the 4th of July.July. Whilst these Matters went on, the Par∣ties from Nissa, were always Plundering and spoiling the Countries, and Captain Strahina, the famous Partisan, who was continually on Parties, made his Inroads near to Philippopolis, and surprized the Turks in several Places of that Neighbour∣hood, with much Spoil and Damage: The Turks alarm'd hereat, got into a Body, and pursued after Strahina,The Turks Attack Strahina. and having overta∣ken him, attacked him with great Fury and Bravery; but were as resolutely repul∣sed, and their Teftish Pasha killed in the Action; 200 of their Horse taken, and much Booty, with the loss only of five Rascians: The like Success Strahina had a∣gainst Kathana Pasha, who meeting on the Road, whilst one Party was returning to So∣phia, as the other was to Nissa; the Turks were beaten, and put to Flight, and the Pasha, with his Men that escaped, were forced to take Refuge in the Mountains, scattered and dispersed, whilst Strahina, and his Men, with their Booty, returned safe to Nissa. And now to conclude the Successes of the many Parties which roved abroad in divers Places, the Captains Schenchendorff, Stra∣hina, and Wildenham, with one Lieutenant Funck, sallied abroad with 100 Germans, and 1500 Rascians, with which having stormed Pernich in three several Places at the same time, they entered the Fortress,Pernich stormed & taken. and cut down all the Turks in the way, only 50 of them got into a Tower, and refusing to take Quarter, Fire was put to the same, and then the People too late cryed out for Mer∣cy; after which the Town was Plundered, and the best of the Goods, with 3000 Head of Cattle, were carried off safe to Py∣roth. But to make way to greater Actions, the French Ambassador at the Ottoman Court,Tekeli declared Prince of Transil∣vania. after a long Sollicitation, had procured for Tekeli a Baratz, or Commission, whereby he was declared Prince of Transilvania, and to publish the same, he dispatched his Cir∣cular Letters to all the Cities and Provin∣ces, written in the Latin Tongue: The Contents whereof were as followeth. THAT whereas God Almighty, and the High and Mighty and always Flourishing Ottoman Empire, had created, and ordained him Prince of the Heredita∣ry Countries of Transilvania, belonging to the Ottoman Empire, with an express Clause, That he should enjoy the same, with such Power, and in the same manner, and with as high and ample Privileges as had been given to Bethlem Gabor; for which Cause and Reason, having sent Greeting to all the People and Subjects of that Country, he did strictly forbid, and inhibit all Persons to give any Suc∣cour or Assistance whatsoever unto the Germans, but on the contrary, to put themselves into a readiness to give Assi∣stance unto him the said Tekeli, as also the Grand Vizier, and the Tartars, who were now coming in great Numbers ve∣ry speedily into the Field, to deliver their Country of Transilvania from the Terrible, and Unjust Oppression of the Germans. Now follows Tekeli's Declaration in La∣tin joyned hereunto.
Emericus Tókólius Dei Gratiâ, à Ful∣gidâ Portâ Ottomanicâ declaratus Prin∣ceps Transylvaniae, Partium Regni Hungariae Dominus, & Siculorum Comes. QUAM preciosa & inaestimabilis res sit, animae corporisque libertas, si caeterorum Orbis Christiani Regnorum ac Nationum exempla praetereamus, pro sufficienti tamen exemplo esse poterit Na∣tioni Hungaricae olim tanto sanguine ac∣quisita libertas; quantam enim Hungari inquietudinem, arma effusionemque san∣guinis impenderint in defensione liberta∣tum suarum, apud homines prudentiâ & experientiâ rerum exornatos, manifestum est; hoc etiam ignotum esse nequit, quod à quo Hungariae Corona & Gubernium in Potestatem Nationis Germanicae devenit, omnia consilia, labores omnes, in eo ver∣tebantur, quâ ratione Nationem Hunga∣ricam debilitare, bonis omnibus privare, tandem Regnum Hungariae haereditarium constituendo ad Servitutem ignominiosam, & intoleranda tributa praeciptari possit. Quod ipsum cum ante plurimos annos prudentiores, & in summâ dignitate con∣stituti Proceres vidissent, neque per innu∣meras instantias, supplicationesque satis∣factionem diplomatis à Domo Austriacâ obtinuissent, è contrario indies laesio li∣bertatum, & intolerabilium contributio∣num onus incrementa sumpsisset, nescien∣tes aliud quid facerent, coacti fuerunt, penes leges Patriae, etiam cum inculpatâ tutelâ, ad vindicandas libertates, arma capere, omnibusque constat, à quot annis bellum continuebatur; quinimo si ad hanc calamitatem praecipitata Natio Hungarica Praedecessorum suorum vestigiis insistens arma non deposuisset, cervices contume∣lioso servitutis Jugo ex voluntate Sponta∣neâ non submisisset, sperare poterat ex di∣vinâ benignitate post multas etiam cala∣mitates antiquae libertatis restitutionem. Transylvania quoque, licet tantopere si∣cut vicina Hungariae non fuerit coacta Na∣tioni Germanicae sese submittere, neque enim in tantis extremitatibus fuerat, ut ad meliora tempora se conservare non po∣tuisset, multis fortalitiis, quae in sua po∣testate habebat firmata, nihilo tamen mi∣nus nonnullis libertatis Patriae contemp∣toribus & privato commodo obnoxiis, quomodo tradita sit, cum omnibus forta∣litiis in extraneorum potestatem, & in quas oppressiones praecipitaverit Dominati∣ones Vestras, ejusdem fructus acerbitas ad∣huc in ore omnium est. Ut autem ad scopum nostrum propius accedamus, etiamsi omnipotentissimus. De∣us nos quoque ad miserias acerbas rede∣gerit, & per multas mutationes vicissitu∣dinesque transire debuerimus propter quas multi ex praecipuis praepotentis hujus Nationis malefactorum suorum premium acceperunt, Deus tamen qui nunquam permittit justam causam finaliter opprimi, nos ex iis omnibus eliberavit, personam causamque nostram, apud praepotentem Nationem, tam gratam honorificamque fecit, ut causam tam dedecorosè suppressae Nationis nostrae non minus in Fulgidâ Por∣tâ, quam apud alios Christianos Monar∣chas utilitèr promovere valeamus. Quorum intuitu, licet in eo nunquam laboraverimus, Fulgida Porta tanquam Transylvaniae Domina Haereditaria fidelia servitia nostra, & in fidelitate constantem perseverantiam, quoque ponderando Prin∣cipatus Transylvanici Dignitatem cum omnibus requisitis & immunitatibus nobis contulit, super indéque diploma & Achname suum, quod antiqui principes multis ex∣pensis obtinere non potuerunt: Iisdem conditionibus, qualibus beatae quondam recordationis serenissimo Principi Gabrieli Bethlem contulerat, nobis quoque dedit sine injuria Regni, ejusdemque territorio∣rum imminutione, una cum statis refi, Resi∣dentem insuper, sive Kapithaiam Tran∣sylvaniae, qui hactenus in Porta fuit, ad nos dimisit: Praeterea Achname Hani Tar∣tarorum nostris etiam in manibus est. Jam in nomine Dei cum militiâ praepo∣tentis Turcarum Imperatoris pariter & Hani Tartarorum movimus indiesque iter nostrum continuamus, Dominationes ve∣stras communiter ex omnibus statibus con∣stitutas supremi, medii, infimique gra∣dus, ordinis per praesentes informare, re∣quirere & admonere cupientes, non dubi∣tamus, quin Universis Patriae libertas e∣jusdemque vindicta in cordibus sit, ideo∣que singuli ex Dominationibus vestris, obli∣gationis suae erga deum & patriam memo∣res cogitent de rebus, recta conscientia in∣surgant, & antequam confinia regni in∣grediamur monstrent Realia Documenta obedientiae expedientes nobis obviam ex omnibus Nationibus ablegatos primariae conditionis, interim viritim arma sumen∣tes, difficultates in passibus semoveant, nemo seipsum vel arma sua Germanis jun∣gat, vel hostiliter se nobis opponat, ad de∣solationem Patriaeque ruinam, & multa∣rum millium animarum depraedationem causam subministret; Literas has paten∣tes nemo supprimat, quin potius publicet, quia talium animae coram judicio Dei ra∣tionem reddent, nostram quoque gravissi∣mam indignationem cum posteris suis

By the many Troops of Tartars which were already entred into Valachia, and by the Increase of Tekeli's Forces, which were become much more numerous and formida∣ble, by the Sums of Money which he had received from France, the Imperial Gene∣rals were greatly alarm'd, and fearing least they should Invade that Country, all the Forces in and about Transylvania, were or∣dered to march under the Command of Ge∣neral Heusler towards the Passes which lead to Walachia; and as they marched, to spoil the Ways, and render them as impractica∣ble, and difficult as was possible. By this time News was come to Nissa, that a great Body of Turks was assembled near Nicopolis, and that the Grand Vizier was actually on his March to joyn with them; whereupon General Veterani, ha∣ving provided the Garrisons with necessary Provisions and Ammunition drew all the Troops he was able unto Nissa, where he remained at a Gaze to observe the Motions of the Turks, and to afford his Assistance unto any Place which should be distressed, or in danger. The Season of the Year was now advan∣ced to the middle of July, when Advies came by way of Walachia, that Sultan Gal∣ga was marching with some Thousands of Tartars towards Bulgaria; and that Budack Commander of the Tartarian Fleet was with four Gallies, and many Frigats, armed with some Guns, and laden with Ammunition and Provisions, coming up the Danube: And moreover that the Grand Vizier was with a very strong Army come as far as So∣phia, and pitched in those Plains, and cau∣sed vast Stores of Corn, and all other Pro∣visions, to be laid up in the Magazines of that City. Some few Days after which the Tartars appeared before Widin with their four Gal∣lies, and about 60 Vessels, on which 5000 Men were Embarked, and immediately be∣gan to fire on the Town; the which News being brought to General Trautmansdorf,The Tar∣tars retire from Wi∣din. he marched immediately with the Troops un∣der his Command, to the Relief of the Place, and was followed by several Vessels laden with Provisions, Convoyed by Boats armed with Musqueteers; which coming in sight of the Turks, they fired incessantly upon them, until such time as the Cannon planted by Trautmansdorf, on the side of the Danube, forced them to quit their Station, and retire farther down the Stream, to the other side of the River; after which, the General having provided the Town with a sufficient Garrison, and all sorts of Provisi∣ons necessary, conducted the Vessels safely back, and marched farther towards the ge∣neral Rendezvous at Jagodina. And because the whole force of the Otto∣man Empire under the Command of the Grand Vizier, was marching from Sophia against the Germans, who were very weak in Servia, and not able to keep the Field a∣gainst the Turks in those Parts;Corbelli reinforces the Troops in Servia. Count Cor∣belli who Commanded the Blockade before Great Waradin, received Orders to march with such Troops as could be spared from the Blockade, to reinforce the Army in Ser∣via, the which was performed accordingly, leaving the Care and Charge of the Block∣ade to Count Schlick. The Arnouts, who had before taken part with the Germans, observing the Weakness of the Christian Troops and the Strength of the Turks,August. joyned against their Inclinations to save themselves with the latter; with which the Grand Vizier being reinforced, a Detachment was made under Command of the Seraskier, to joyn with Tekeli in Wala∣chia, whilst another Pasha was employed to Besiege Widin both by Land and Water; and the Vizier marched in Person with the gross of his Army towards Nissa, with 100 Pieces of Cannon, and 12 Mortars. Upon this News General Veterani order∣ed all the Commanders of the several Posts and Passages leading towards Nissa, to leave their Guards, and retire with their Men, Ammunition, Provision, and Cannon to the City; which having furnished with a suffi∣cient
Garrison of 3000 Foot, and 500 Horse, he marched back with the remainder of the Army towards Alexin,Th Chri∣stian Camp at Alexin. and there formed his Camp. In the mean time the Grand Vizier on his March to Niss, at which he aimed, took Pyroth in the space of three or four Days,Pyroth taken. upon Capitulation with the Garrison, which consisted of no more than 150 Men, to be conducted safely to Nissa, but the Vizier pursued them so close at the Heels, that on the 14th of August he Invested the City with his whole Army, and on the 17th be∣gan an Attack at Bergele, compassing one half of the City, on that side; and on the same Day he sent a Chiaus with Letters to summon the Place, the which Colonel Jorger returned back again unopened,Nissa in∣vestd. with this Answer, That there was none there who could read Turkish. Upon return of this Answer, the Grand Vizier caused some Cannon to be shot into the City; and on the next Day the Tren∣ches to be opened, after which the Turks fi∣red without ceasing, both with their Can∣non and Mortars; and because it was be∣lieved, that the Town would not hold out for any long time, the Turks plied their Business very close, and made their Attacks with wonderful Courage and Bravery. A Sally made from the Town.On the 19th General Staremberg, who now Commanded in Nissa, in the Place of Colonel Jorger, who was fallen sick, or∣dered a Sally to be made by 100 Grana∣diers, and 200 Fuzeleers, sustained by a Battalion of German Foot, and at the same time all the Horse of the Garrison made a Sally on the other side of the Town, which succeeded so well, that above 1000 Turks were killed on the Place, most of which were slain in their Trenches; besides those, who upon the Retreat of the Christians, pursuing them to the Palisadoes of the Town, were killed by the Cannon, and Musquets from the Redoubts, and Out-works. In this Sally the Besieged had 20 Men killed, and 60 wounded. Whilst the Siege of Nissa proceeded in this manner, the Seraskier having joyned his Troops with those of the Tartars, of the Prince of Walachia, and the Forces also of Tekeli, (under whom were nine Pasha's) their whole Army consisted of 16000 Horse, 2000 Janisaries, and 500 Talpats, with which Tekeli marched towards a certain Pass called Terezwar, being distant about three Leagues from Cronstadt, where General Heusler lay encamped with four Regiments of Horse, consisting in all of about 1700 Men, together with 5000 Transylvanians, called Zecklers from the Province so named, under the Command of General Tolecki. Tekeli not knowing well how he might with Advantage attack Heusler, passed his Forces over Mountains, and untrodden Ways, be∣ing conducted by the People of the Coun∣try, until they came within sight of the Germans; who nothing dismayed at the ap∣pearance of so formidable and unequal a force, marched with the right Wing directly against that of the Enemies left, and charg∣ed them so furiously that they put them to a shameful Flight, and had that Day gained a most entire Victory; had the Zecklers se∣conded this good beginning; but instead thereof, they most basely fled without string one Musquet; so that then the whole force of the Enemy falling upon General Heusler,General Heusle defated and his Men, having quitted their former advantageous Post, they were so over-po∣wered by them, that after a long and bloody Fight, they were put to the Rout: In this Action General Nordquermes, Tolecki, Von Wald, Springfelt and Winckler, with some Captains, and 500 common Horsemen were killed: General Magni escaped, and saved himself in the Church of a Village called Hansberg, where a Peasant killed him with a Pitchfork, and buried him under a Dung∣hill: General Heusler having his Horse kil∣led under him, was taken Prisoner by Tekeli's Men, and Marquis Doria, and Major Fisker by the Tartars: Lieut. Col. Rainin, with se∣veral Captains, Lieutenants, and Ensigns, and 32 common Soldiers were made Priso∣ners by the Turks. The Enemies also gain∣ed four Pieces of Cannon, 29 Standards, and three Waggons with Ammunition, but lost 3000 of their Men in this Action; the re∣mainder of the German Horse being about 1200 Men, with 13 Standards, retreated under Hermanstadt. After the Fight was ended, Count Tekeli being desirous to rescue as many Prisoners as he could out of the Hands of the Tartars, he bought Marquis Doria for 60 Rix-dollars,Ma  Doria sold for 60 Rix Dollars. and many other Officers for a small Matter, and afterwards sent away the Marquis Doria with the fol∣lowing Letter to his Lady at Vienna, writ∣ten in Latin. GOD Almighty comfort thee,Tekeli's Letter to his Prin∣cess. and also me with a more happy time. After many Misfortunes, I have been comforted with a Vi∣ctory over my Enemies; having had the good Fortune to make General Heusler my Prisoner, and Marquis Doria, which with several other German Officers, have hunted after my Life. This Accident may give an occasion for thy Re∣leasement; to which end I have sent the said Marquis unto thee (for whom General Heusler remains Security) and with him I have sent my Servant Michael for a Companion; to the end that he being an Eye-witness of my State and Condition, may render thee a true Account and Information thereof. God grant that he may bring me good News from thee. Live well. Yours Emericus Tekeli.
This Letter being delivered to the Prin∣cess by the Hand of Marquis Doria, an Answer was returned in Latine, as fol∣loweth. The Prin∣cess's An∣swer.I Wish thee Health, and all Blessings from God, (whose Name be praised) for giving me the happiness to see the proper Hand-wri∣ting of my beloved Husband, and therewith his remembrance of me. Marquis Doria hath ac∣quainted me with the Love which thou profes∣sest towards me. I doubt not but Marquis Doria will inform His Imperial Majesty with the An∣swer I have returned to thy Letter, viz. That I depend on Almighty God's Providence, and the Emperor's Clemency, and as to other Mat∣ters, I am ready to give sufficient Security, that if leave should be permitted me to go and meet my Emericus Tekeli, according to my Nuptial Duty, that I will return again at the time appointed; as to what the Imperial Court will do about the Prisoners, the Marquis will acquaint you; to accept or reject the Conditi∣ons, will depend much on your Affections towards me. the Marquis having earnestly sollicited his Business, hath gotten an early Dispatch; he says as much in short as is enough, and you may believe him. I have spoken with your Servant, who hath been sick, but now is better. Perhaps my Emericus thought me to be some Lady in a Nunnery, because he gives me not the Name of his Wife, perhaps it might be to try me, whe∣ther I desire to be so called. Gold is tryed in the Fire, which Tryal I willingly suffer from my Beloved, expecting impatiently another Let∣ter. God deliver the Prisoners, and comfort all afflicted Minds, which I heartily wish, Amen. Your Dutiful Wife, Helena Zrinin. From Vienna, Septemb. 24. But let us here leave Marquis Doria re∣turning with his Answers to Tekeli, whilst we discourse a while concerning what the Turks are farther acting before Nissa in Ser∣via, now straitly besieged by the Grand Vi∣zier himself. An Attempt was made at the same time on Widin,Widin invested. by the Turkish Fleet, which they expected should take the Place without any Land Forces; but they being beaten off, and four of their Ships sunk, the Vizier commanded that the Place should be Besieged both by Land and Water; accord∣ingly the Lines were finished, and the Bat∣teries raised by the 24th of August. In like manner the Germans had perfected a Fort which they had raised on an Island near Orsoa, called Carolina, after the Name of the Empe∣ror's second Son; and therein a Garrison was put of 400 Germans, and 1000 Rascians, with 24 Pieces of Cannon, and all other Necessaries required for maintenance of the Place. Whilst things were in this doubtful Con∣dition, and the Christian Army commanded by General Veterani, lying at Jagodina,Pr. Lewis at lago∣dina. under some Discouragement by reason of the near approach of the Grand Vizier, Prince Lewis of Baden arrived to the great Joy of the Camp, bringing with him a Regiment of Hus∣sars. The Prince had taken a view of the Camp, and entered into a Council of War, touching what was to be done, when the un∣happy News arrived of the total Defeat of General Heusler in Transylvania, which al∣tered all the Measures before agreed; and new Resolutions were taken to march thi∣ther with the greatest force of the Army, of which General Aspremont was to lead the Van by way of Semendria, where care had been taken to erect a Bridge for Passage of the Troops; and for the better security of the Ships laden with Provisions, and with Sick and Wounded People. The Horse remained on an Eminence, until all were Embarked; and Orders were sent to the Governor of Crassowitz to demolish that Fort, and with the Germans National Troops, and the Country People who were with him, to march towards Belgrade. By this time all Intercourse with Nissa was cut off,Nissa straitly Be∣sieged the Vizier having encompassed the City on all sides with an Army, as was reported of 30000 Foot, and 50000 Horse, besides 15000 Tartars daily expected; the appearance of which, was enough to have affrighted the Place to an immediate Sur∣render, as was expected by the Grand Vi∣zier; but contrary thereunto he met with a most vigorous Resistance, to the great loss of his Men; and a second time,And At∣tacked. which was the last of August, they made another more violent Attack with fresh Troops, and were still repulsed with greater loss: At length the Turks for saving their Men, made a trial of some Mines, which they sprang in divers Places,Septemb. but most commonly they reversed to the greater Damage and Mischief of the Turks themselves. The Grand Vizier having understood, that Prince Lewis was on the Retreat, and had withdrawn his Forces from Widin, and Semendria, detached a part of his Army to Widin; the which Garrison consisting of no more than 800 Men, it was not probable, that they should be able to withstand any long Siege, and therefore being sensible,Widin surrender∣ed. that no Succour was to be expected, they ren∣dered themselves up to the Enemy on the 29th of August, before any Breach was made, or the Enemy advanced within 40 Paces of the Walls; despair of Succour put them up∣on this Resolution,The Garri∣son march∣es and joyns with Pr. Lewis. whereby they gained such good Conditions, that they marched away, and joyned with the Army of Prince Lewis, the 11th of September.
Exemplum Epistolae ab Amico ad Legatum Colyer, e Castris Turcicis ad urbem Nicaeam positis, missae. Sept. xvi. A. D. 1690. TAmetsi per fidum ac certum ho∣minem, qui Sagiri Achmetis Al∣gazirani causam, & ablatorum quingen∣torum Leoninorum restitutionem huc missus fuerat, Excae. Vae. cuncta, quae hic acta, perscripsi, non male tamen me facturum existimavi, si & illa repete∣rem, & quae post consecuta sunt, adjun∣gerem. A. d. ix. Aug. Primus Vizirius cum exercitu ad munimentum Sarkioi accessit: quod cum non statim dederetur, vis ad∣hibita est: cui impares, qui in praesidio, mi∣lites, postquam horas 24 hosti fortiter resti∣tissent, honestas pacti conditiones, deditio∣nem fecêre; exietuntque ducenti Germa∣ni, Hungatique milites armati cum im∣pedimentis, & à praefecto Turcico ad munimentum, cui Palanca Mustafa Pas∣cia nomen, deducti sunt. Tria hic tan∣tum tormenta minora campestria reperta, cum nonnullis vasis pulveris pyrii. A. d. xi. Ad paulo ante memoratum Palancae munimentum venimus, desertum & exinanitum rebus omnibus à Germanis, qui ibi in praesidio fuerant. A. d. xv. Nissam perventum, quam absolutissime munitam invenimus. Ad∣motis mox propius castris omni vi op∣pugnatio instituta est: nec minore vir∣tute oppidum defensum: ita ut post xxiii dierum obsidionem unius Sagargibassi cu∣niculi vix ad crepidinem fossae promotae fuerint. Ab quatuor simul locis coepta oppugnatio est: primas partes curabat Janizarorum Praefectus cum Sagargibassi: alter ab hoc erat propraefectus Janizaro∣rum: tertiae Albanis obvenerant: quar∣tas obtinebant Cairini, sive Aegyptii. His cunctis praesidiarii undique simul admirabili virtute, magnaque cum Tur∣carum pernicie restiterunt. E Gallis transfugis cognitum est, Ducem Vetera∣ni quinto ante obsidionem die ex oppido discessisse, ut suppetias procuraret, re∣licto, qui munimentum, dum ipse abes∣set, tueretur, Stahrembergio, Stahrem∣bergii istius, qui Viennam defendit, ag∣nato, cum trium admodum millium mi∣litum praesidio, omnique rerum ad obsi∣dionem tolerandam necessariarum copia. Uno ante mense sex Germanorum millia haud procul Viminatio abfuerant: verum intellecto, Sultanum Galga, Tartarorum Hani filium natu maximum indies in vi∣cinia exspectari, ad sex alias cohortes sub Jagodini se moenia receperant, pari∣terque cum iis Moravam transierant: at postpaulo cognito rursus eorundem Tar∣tarorum ad haec loca adventu, nostra∣rumque copiarum peringenti numero, Tauruni, Semendriaeque securitati pro∣specturi, Danubium petivêre: quos mox Tartari subsecuti sunt. A. d. xxx. Nuncius huc à Fonduco Mustaphâ Pasciâ missus attulit, ipsum una cum Tókólaeo per invios montes, & inaccessa juga, cum omni peditatu, absque tormentis impedimentisque, solis acinacibus & bombardis armato in Tran∣sylvaniam perrupisse, obviumque descen∣dentibus Heislerum obfirmato in mortem animo invasisse, strictisque acinacibus, non dato ad explodenda tormenta, aut repetendam Sclopetorum majorum mino∣rumque explosionem tempore, in Germa∣nos, Hungarosque milites irruisse, & mox in fugam actos, ac à Tartaris cir∣cumventos occidione cecidisse: ita ut de multis millibus perpauci evaserint. Cap∣tos autem Ducem ipsum Heislerum, Mar∣chionem Doria, & Comitem Magni. In caesorum numero repertum primum illius Provinciae Ministrum Telleki; item praefectum quendam cohortis Germanum, & aliquam multos de praecipua Hungaro∣rum nobilitate desideratos. Hanc porro victoriam trecentorum illis, non amplius militum jactura stetisse: unum tantum alicujus nominis cecidisse praefectum Tur∣cici exercitus Cerkisium Achmetem. Ex eodem nuncio accepimus, Turcarum, Tar∣tarorum, Walachorum, & Tókóliano∣rum conjunctas copias vix xv millia mi∣litum explesse. Tókólaeus captivos ma∣jores minoresque duces cunctos penes se retinet, transmissis tantum viginti signis ad Vizirium: quae ille èvestigio eopse, quo accepit die una cum expugnati in∣tra sextum diem Viminatii nuncio ad magnum Sultanum misit. Vizirium aiunt scripsisse Tókólaeo de mittendo ad se Heislero: at illum re∣spondisse, eo sibi imprimis opus esse cum ad subjugandam Transylvaniam, tum ad recuperandam conjugem suam Principem Ragotzki. Idem, quem dixi, Fonducus in Cerkisii Achmetis locum Copiarum Turcicarum dux suffectus est. A. d. v Sept. Sultanus Galga ad Vi∣zirii colloquium publice admissus, & ab eo equo eximio, ephippio & phaleris
ditissime exornato, ut & acinace gem∣mato, ac talari veste murinis pellibus du∣plicata donatus est: familiaribus autem, & comitibus ad ducentas talares de more datae. Hic autem Princeps cum Kiaman∣kiseo, aliisque duobus Turcicis praefectis a. d. viii. hujus mensis Semendriam op∣pugnatum abiit, comitantibus duobus Turcarum millibus, avectisque secum de∣cem tormentis campestribus. Valachorum Princeps, etiamnum apud Tókólaeum haeret in Transylvania, ade∣ritque tamdiu Turcico exercitui, donec ille Transylvaniae sibi principatum certa possessione vindicarit. Praecipua namque munimenta in potestate adhucdum Cae∣saris sunt: duo vero tantum oppida Bra∣slau & Fogarest Tókólaeo semet submi∣sêre. A. d. vii. Vizirius unum de fuis Ca∣pigibassis, sive viatoribus, ad exercitus praefectum Mustafam Fonducum, ut & ad Tókólaeum in Transylvaniam misit, talarem singulis vestem murinis pellibus suffultam, & aliquot simplices caeteris minoribus tribunis, ac praefectis, munus illuc delaturum. Valachorum Principi, quique ex ejus comitatu, novem itidem consimiles vestes missae sunt. Hac occasione usus centurio Gallus hinc una in Transylvaniam abiit, qui an∣no priore cum Tókólaeo Sophiam vene∣rat, & cum Legato Gallico Constanti∣nopolin profectus inde in Galliam traje∣cerat. Nunc autem cursu publico Con∣stantinopolin reversus huc venerat, mul∣ta de Gallicis victoriis jactitans, quas de Batavis & Anglis reportaverant. His addebat interpres Gallicus Fontanus, Gallos Batavorum exercitum sub Wal∣deckio in fugam conjecisse, duodecim millibus caesis, octo captis: mari vero conjunctas Batavorum & Anglorum clas∣ses à Gallica victas fugatasque. At id verum esse negitant alii: Regem autem Gulielmum Hiberniam imperio suo subje∣cisse, pulso ac dein in Galliam se recipi∣ente Rege Jacobo. Ad haec Galli nil respondent, nisi, quod certum hujus rei à legato suo nuncium necdum sese acce∣pisse prae se ferant. A. d. ix. Nicaeae Praefectus tubicinem ad Galilum Pascia de deditione misit, si aequis ea conditionibus, sibique honestis permitteretur; petens, ut Vizirius eam in rem tres ad se militares duces mitteret. Verum Vizirius, si de tradenda urbe secum agere decrevisset, ipsius esse respon∣dit, certos ad se delegatos mittere. Hoc accepto responso, duo eodem die centu∣riones, cum adjuncto Commissario, in Castra Turcica profecti sunt: atque ita inter hos & Kiaiabejum ac Sagargibas∣sum, aliosque Janizarorum Duces, prae∣sente etiam pro-Vizirio, convenit, ut oppidum cum omnibus commeatibus & apparatu bellico, nec non Turcjs fidem Christianam amplexis, ut & servis ac subditis Turcicis, qui in oppido inveni∣rentur, dederetur: Germani, Hungari, aliique milites praesidiarii armati, cum conjugibus ac liberis, impedimentisque omnibus, salvi & incolumes egrederen∣tur, concessis ad eorum devectionem centum curribus, additoque prae∣sidio & praefecto, qui deducerent eos, quocunque vellent: interea temporis praesidium èvestigio fossis & munimentis exterioribus digrediens Janizaris ea tra∣deret. Quod ubi factum, a. d. x Sept. milites nonnulli de praesidio pedites e∣quitesque cum impedimentis suis oppido egressi sunt: viis autem militaribus, cu∣niculis interruptis corruptisque, accidit, ut currus aliquot eversi fractique fuerint: Unde qui praecedebant, aliquantum à cae∣teris disjuncti, cum ad extrema Turca∣rum castra pervenissent, pars à deducen∣tibus Turcis, aliisque militibus spoliati, nonnulli etiam occisi sunt; conjugesque ac liberi eorum in servitutem abducti; quorum numerus ignoratur. At hoc certum est, Vizirium, his cognitis, è ve∣stigio Germanis praesidiariis mandasse, ut in oppido resisterent, posteroque die servatis ordinibus, & cunctis rite dispo∣fitis exirent: vulgato interim per exer∣citum Turcicum edicto, ut, qui de mili∣tibus Christianis, eorumve conjugibus ac liberis quemquam penes se haberent, eos∣dem intra xii horarum spatium dimitte∣rent, atque in libertatem restituerent: qui secus fecissent, capital iis fore. Sed pauci eorum ad suos rediere. Hanc ob culpam duo supremi Equitum praefecti, nunciorumque Sultani Princeps, dignitate dejecti, & cujuscunque muneris publici administrandi in posterum incapaces de∣clarati sunt; utpote qui milites suos in officio continere nequivissent. Munimentum illaesum atque integrum inventum est: siquidem Turcae, uti su∣pradictum, trium & viginti dierum spa∣tio vix ad exterioris fossae supercilium appropinquaverant. Rogavi ego non∣nullos è militaribus de praesidio ducibus, quae maturandae deditionis causa fuisset? Respondere, nullam auxilii spem: cui mandatum accesserit clanculum ad ipsos perlatum, uti oppidum dederent, ac sa∣luti militum prospicerent. Certe mirari
satis nequo, quum omnes ad oppidum aditus diligentissime obsessi fuerint; quî fieri potuerit, ut quis ad eos inobserva∣tus pertransierit? Postquam praesidium oppido digressum est, interpreti Gallico imperatum, ut Gallos, quorum aliquot centeni erant ad transitum in castra Turcica invitaret: verum quindecim tantum transiere; quo∣rum quinque religionem Christianam Turcica mutarunt: reliqui Constantino∣polin profecti. Quod autem gentem hanc attinet, bona fide Vae. Excae. affirmare possem, fraternam ipsos Turcis fidem, operamque praestare. A. d. xii. Galilus Praefectus è castris semet cum Albanis ad Sultanum Galga contulit, suas cum illius copias conjun∣cturus. Hodie vero, qui xvi Septemb. Vizirius castra movet, eo animo atque spe fore, ut intra paucos dies Semen∣dria potiatur: qua capta Taurunum ag∣gressurus est: quod mihi inceptum aspe∣rum ac difficile videtur, quum anni tempus intempestivum, militumque clan∣culum sese subducentium haud exiguum numerum considero. Exemplum alterius ab eodem Epistolae. DEditionem Nissae proximis inde li∣teris Excae. Vae. significavi: his∣ce, quae post evenêre, exponam. A. d. xvi. Sept. Semendriam institu∣tum iter, & a. d. xxv. castra ad urbem posita sunt. Verum a. d. xxvii. ante exspectatum, Albani, Janizarique Por∣tam Flumentanam vi summa oppugnantes irrupêre, & universum praesidium 250 Germanorum militum, nemini parcentes, trucidavêre. A. d. xxx. Motis Castris, Taurunum profecti sumus: eademque vespera ad octavum ab urbe lapidem castrametati, prostridie ab omni eam parte, cinximus. Cum vero ad usque viii Octobr. multa cum virtute defenderetur, Deo ita per∣mittente, invictum illud munimentum (humano more loquor) arte summa mu∣nitum, in Turcarum venit potestatem. Eodem die servus Turca ex urbe in Al∣banorum stativa transfugus, & â Galilo Pascia exactissime interrogatus, exami∣natusque, turrim in urbe ostendit, in qua magna vis pulveris pyrij esset recondita. Bombis igitur in eam directis, tectum, quod ex ligno erat, incensum, & dein∣ceps hora circiter promeridiana tertia universa interior urbs flammis & ignibus colluxit, turrisque vi accensi pulveris in aera disjecta muros urbis ita convulsit, ut prolapsi fossas adimplerent. Hinc sta∣tim Albani civitatem invadentes, atque irrumpentes, nec sexui nec aetati peper∣cere, quidquid obvium ferro conficientes. Tristissimus hic casus ita Germanos per∣turbavit, ut desubito nullo servato ordine ad portum flumenque profugerent, adeo trepide, ut, mortem vitare conantes, in scaphas & naviculas se praecipitarent, ac divinae se providentiae permittentes, pars secundo flumine descenderent, pars eodem adverso, remorum auxilio evadere cona∣rentur. Verum maximam eorum partem mox immissi Tartari consecuti ceperunt: adeo ut de tribus militum millibus, qui∣bus hoc praesidium constitit, vix tre∣centos effugisse existimem, quos noctis ingruentis tenebrae texerunt, atque con∣servarunt. Inter captivos nemo alicujus nominis repertus: neque ex illorum quoquam, quid Principe Croïaco factum sit, resciri hactenus potuit; quamquam diligentis∣sime in eum inquisitum fuit. Hic Prin∣ceps eodem mensis Oct. die octavo Tau∣runum venerat Comitemque Aspremon∣tium certiorem fecerat auxilii cohortium aliquot Germanarum postridie secundo flumine adventuri. Sed nec de hoc As∣premontio certi quidpiam cognosci, inda∣garíve potuit. Non in interiore, neque in exteriore urbe vel minima casula restitit, super∣fuitve illaesa: adeo cuncta aedificia flam∣mis consumpta sunt. Interioris urbis moe∣nia tota sedibus suis evulsa & disjecta sunt: sed exterioris pleraque supersunt. Hac urbis per pulverem pyrium ever∣sione, bomborumque aliquot, qui altero etiam ab urbe capta die dissiliere, mag∣nus Turcarum numerus interiit. A. d. xi. Tartarorum Hanus, corpore licet invalidus, in castra ad Vizirium venit; quicum hic belli consilia agita∣turus est. Caeterum jam sedet Vizirio, tres Turcicos praefectos cum omni Tarta∣rorum copia Osseckium mittere. Cui rei exsequendae Savus fl. ponte jungitur, qui intra biduum è navibus & scaphis, magno numero ad Belgradum repertis, perfectus erit, paratusque. Hoc porro Excae. Vae. affirmare ausim, ni tempus anni expeditionibus bellicis commodum jam effluxisset, fore, ut Vi∣zirius hoc adhuc anno Budam tenderet. Cognovit enim è captivis, perpaucos tam Budae, quam Osseckii milites in prae∣sidio esse, eosque magnam partem è morbo infirmos.
Reperta Tauruni tormenta bellica ma∣jora centum; minora vero multo plura: quae cum bombis & pulveris pyrii copia sub terram reconditi, inventique, quan∣tumvis validae sustinendae sufficiant obsi∣dioni. De Tókólaeo nil certi accepimus, ni∣si quod plebem sibi Transylvanicam in∣dies magis magisque conciliet, ac sub∣jiciat: tum in eo esse, ut Albae Juliae de more tanquam Princeps Transylvaniae inauguretur. Veruntamen munimenta pleraque in potestate adhuc sunt Caesa∣rianorum. Quantum inquirendo perci∣pio, ad ultimum hujus mensis Octobris hic subsistemus: deinde in hyberna miles deducetur. Atque haec hactenus: caetera proximis literis perscribam. Vale. The News of the Surrender of Widin, caused the Vizier to hasten the taking of Nissa, that he might have time afterwards before the Winter to take in Belgrade; to which end he furiously assaulted the place on all sides, and continually both by Day and Night fired with Cannon and Bombs into the City; by which the Garrison be∣ing diminished from 3 unto 2000 Men, and the Counterscarp taken, and no hopes of Relief, General Staremberg the Gover∣nor thereof was forced to a Capitulation,Nissa sur∣rendred. and Surrendered on the 8th of September on very honourable Terms: Namely, That the Garrison should march out with Bag and Baggage, Trumpets sounding, and Drums beating, Colours flying, and with all their Arms, and to be conveyed in safety to the Morava. But the Turks did not faithfully observe this Agreement, but robbed and disarmed many of them. The Tartars also pursued after them as far as Semendria, with intent to cut them all off; of which Count Staremberg having Advice, he speedily passed the Danube, and so arrived in safety at Belgrade. The Turks found 90 pieces of Cannon and Mortar-pieces in Nissa; after the taking of which they marched directly towards Bel∣grade, and took Semendria in their way, of which Lieutenant Colonel Weingartler, a stout and valiant Soldier, was the Go∣vernor; but having no more than 500 Germns, and 400 Rascian Soldiers in all, for defence of the place, they sustained a Storm from all the Turkish Army; but be∣ing overwhelmed with Numbers,Semen∣dria taken by Storm, and the Garrison put to the Sword. the Go∣vernour with all his Soldiers were put to the Sword and perished; and the Turks became Masters of the place, in which they found a good Booty with quantity of Provisions. In the mean time Prince Lewis conti∣nued his march towards Transylvania, and having passed the Danube at Culitz, a place something below Semendria, he arrived at Karansebes with the Horse on the 16th, but the Foot and Baggage came not thi∣ther until two days afterwards. And here it was that the Prince received Intelligence how that Tekeli's Lieutenant-General was marching against him with some thou∣sands of Horse, by way of the Valley of Hadegger, leading to that place, which is called the Iron-Gate, with intent to hinder the Prince's passage into Transylvania; but the Germans were beforehand with them, and with a Party of Horse took posses∣sion of the Pass before Tekeli's Men could reach it;P. Lewis in Tran∣silvania. which they maintained for two or three days before the Army could come and enter into it; and having passed it about the 21st, they drew into Battalia according to the situation of the Ground, and encamped near the Ancient Romana Colonia Vulpia Trajana, the Ruins of which do still appear, where they remained until the 24th, before which time their heavy Baggage could not arrive at the Camp. The German Army being thus entered into Transylvania, many of the Nobility of that Country applied themselves to the Prince for Safe-Conducts, or Protections, to live quietly and to save their Goods; whilst in the mean time, the Rascians were entered into Walachia, where they plun∣dered, burned, and put all to the Sword with as much Cruelty as enraged Men can exercise one against the other. But Prince Lewis marched with his Army in three Lines, until they came within an hours distance from Huniad, and here the Army rested for a while. The Turks, as we have said, having taken Semendria, and killed all that were it, the Grand Vizier marched with all his Forces towards Belgrade; of which, News being carried to the Imperial Court, the Duke of Croy was immediately dispatched to Belgrade, to take upon him the Com∣mand of that City. The Duke was sent away on the 1st of October,October The Grand Vizier in∣vests Bel∣grade. which was the Day that the Grand Vizier invested Belgrade, and en∣camped in the very same Places and Posts which the Christians had set out and marked two years before; And on the 2d he had surrounded the City from the Danube to the Save; and from that Day to the 8th they fired continually with their Cannon and Bombs without ceasing, and stormed the Pallisadoes with such Rage, without fear or wit, that the Defendants wondered to see them run on so desperately before any Breach, or the least opening was made to favour or prepare for an Attack.
On the 8th, The Duke of Croy arrived in the City by Boat, and immediately applied himself to take a View with Ge∣neral Aspremont, and Officers of the Ar∣tillery of all the Works and Fortifications, as also of the Enemies Trenches, which were already advanced within 12 Paces of the Pallisadoes;The Duke of Croy at Belgrade. which done, he reti∣red to his Lodging; and that night, the Besieged discovered and emptied one of the Turks Mines just ready to be Sprung: Next Morning the Duke of Croy being desirous to send a true account to the Em∣peror of the State and Condition of the Place, a Draught thereof was drawn and subscribed by General Aspremont, and Of∣ficers of the Artillery; which whilst the Duke, after a small Breakfast, was pre∣paring to dispatch away, giving an Ac∣count withall, that there were not above 3200 Men in the place fit for Service, an outery was made,The Steeple of the Castle takes fire. That the great Blue-Steeple of the Castle began to burn; up∣on which Alarm the Generals and others applying themselves to extinguish the Fire, it was soon put out. But no sooner were the Generals and People returned to their Homes, and busily employed in their Dispatches for Vienna, which were to be carried by the Count Archinto; but by some unknown Accident; or as it is ra∣ther believed, by the Treachery of a Turk disguised in a German Habit, or by the villainous and traiterous Practice of some French, who had been employed to work in the Magazines, and had that Morning Deserted, and gone over to the Turk; the said Blue-Steeple, about three or four a Clock in the Afternoon (which was the principal Magazine for Powder in all the City) took Fire,Again on fire and blows up. and blew up, with such Violence, that the Duke was not only wounded, but half buried in the rubbish of his own Lodgings, and dis-interred as it were by a Page of General Aspremont. This blow over-turned the great Bulwark, which defended the Castle, together with its Walls, Guns, and other Defences, opening so large a Breach for the Enemy, that they might have entered the Town with whole Squadrons: And so extraor∣dinary and fatal was this blow, that it de∣stroyed a thousand Men of the Garrison,A great slaughter thereby. which were drawn up on the place of Arms and on the Walls; so that when the Ge∣nerals ordered new Men to supply the Places of those who had been killed by this fatal Clap, and defend the Breach, they could not find a sufficient number to with∣stand the Enemy, then ready to take ad∣vantage of this dreadful blow; howso∣ever, they made the best resistance pos∣sible, until their remaining Magazines and Store-Houses took Fire, and blew up one after the other, in such a dismal manner, that for Fire, Powder, Smoak, Stones,All the Magazines of Powder and Prov∣sions blown up. and Dust, one Man could not see, much less know the other; and in this Confu∣sion, not only the greatest part of the Garrison perished, but even a thousand Turks storming at that time the Walls, and entring the City, were also lost; and such as remained alive were forced to re∣treat back to the Camp; at which time it seemed, as if a Cessation of Arms had been made during this gloomy and dismal Interval; but so soon as it had cleared up a little, the Turks observing the great Consternation in the City, so that those who remained alive, could make no resi∣stance, they rather entered the Walls than Stormed them;Belgrade taken. And being come within the City, they found very few Christians living, or Houses standing, and the very Boats in the River were sunk by the weight of the Stones and rubbish which were fallen into them; so that those who e∣scaped, saved themselves for the most part by Swimming, some over the Danube, and some over the Save; on which occasion, howsoever some few Boats remained,The Duke of Croy e∣scapes with the Gene∣rals. by which many passed over, and amongst the rest, the Duke, and General Aspremont, with some of their Servants; but no Man could save more than what he carried about him. Count Aspremont being blamed for this Action, was cleared by this following Copy. Copie de l'Attestation donnee par le Prince Louis de Bade, a Monsieur le Comte d'Aspremont au sujet de la parte de la Forteresse de Belgrade. LA Forteresse de Belgrade ayant été mal∣heureusement prise par les ennemis l'an 1690. ensuitte de la grande confusion que causa l'embrasement du Magazine a poudre, plusieurs personnes mal informées des circon∣stances de cette affaire en ont voulu attri∣buer principalement la faute au Comte d'As∣premont quoyqu'il n'y commandast plus en Chef; ce qui a extremement diminué dans le monde le bon credit dans le quel il etoit, sur tout a cause qu'il avoit été mis en arrest comme Sa Majesté Imperial a accoutumé de faire en de semblables rencontres. N'ayant donc appris autre chose de Mon∣seigneur le Duc de Croy, ainsi que des autres Generaux & Officiers qui ont été commandez dans la dite Forteresse; si non que le susdit Comte d'Aspremont y a fait en toutes ma∣nieres
son devoir, & y a montré son zéle en tout ce qui pouvoit concerner le service de Sa Majesté Imperiale, tellement qu'ayant été pleinement informé de tout le susdit, & en consideration de la verité du fait je n'ay pû faire moins que de donner a Monsieur le Comte d'Aspremont non sculement la presente Atte∣station, mais aussi pour son unique Consola∣tion, & afin qu'am chacun puisse voir & con∣noitre le contraire des Calomnies dont on l'a voulu charger, de le recommander aupres de nôtre tres Clement Maitre & en tous lieux ou il pourroit en avoir besoin pour son avance∣ment, étant hors de doute que sa été entiere∣ment contre la Clemente Intention de Sa Ma∣jesté Imperiale qu'il a dû souffrir toutes ces Calomnies. En foy de quoy j'ay signé la presente & y ay fait apposer mon cachet. Fait a Vienne, ce 10 Fevrier 1693. Louis Margrave de Baden de Sa Majeste Imperiale Lieutenant General, Marechal de Camp, Colonel & Gouverneur de Raab. And thus every Man shifting as well as he could for himself, the Duke rallied about 400 Men in all, with which he arrived at Titul, and afterwards marched with them to Peter Waradin; but the Duke remained not long here, before he departed, and took his march for Esseck, emptying all the Garrisons by the way, such as Illock, Sabaz, and Brod, and joyn∣ing all the Forces he was able to Con∣serve that important place; it being con∣jectured, that after having rendred them∣selves Masters of Belgrade, the Turks would not stop there, but following the air of their good Fortune, would endeavour also to take Esseck: But the Season of the Year being far spent, it was believed that the Grand Vizier would think he had done enough for this Summer, and therefore would conclude the Campagne with an Action of so much Glory; but the Grand Vizier rested not here, but having left 10000 Men for a Garrison in Belgrade, and recommended the repair of the Breaches to the Care of some French Ingeniers that followed the Army, and leaving some of their Horse Cantoned near the City; the greatest part of their Cavalry was orde∣red for the Upper Hungary; upon the News of which,The Ger∣mans  the Blk∣ade of Great-Waradin. the Germans were so Alarm'd, that they quitted the Blockade before Great Waradin, and with other Troops which were in the Neighbourhood, they marched towards the Tibiscus, to se∣cure the passage of that River. In the mean time the Pasha of Bosnia was Commanded by the Grand Vizier to take Esseck, whilst he himself, with a strong Army of Turks passed the Da∣nube; whereupon the Germans quitted Lu∣gos, and Caranzebes, and the Vizier marched directly to Lippa, which place having been attacked with much Resolution, and continual Storms, and in want of all Pro∣visions, was forced to Surrender, but on very honourable Capitulations, being per∣mitted to march out with Bag and Bag∣gage, Drums beating, and with Colours flying: The Besieged lost but ten Men, but the Turks 800 in this Action. Whilst Matters succeeded in this man∣ner with the Vizier's Army,P. Lewis continues his march, Prince Lewis of Baden continued his march by way of Weissenburg and Mullenbach, and arrived the 3d of October at Hermanstadt, where for want of Provisions he was forced to remain for some days; but being at length supplied with all things necessary, they decamped, and came to Medies,And beats several Parties of the Enemy. where they attacked, and beat several Parties of the Enemies, whose Heads they brought with Triumph into the Camp: For as to Tekeli, and his Troops, they never stood their Ground, but as Prince Lewis ad∣vanced, they always retreated, keeping at least six Leagues distant from the German Army. At length he came to Czick upon the Borders of Walachia; where to en∣courage and keep his Followers together, he boasted of great Succours coming from the Turks: But this Report would not serve his turn; for the Prince of Walachia having received Intelligence that the Ras∣cians did much Infest and Ruin his Coun∣try, he was the first to desert the Army, and return home to defend and preserve the same. Soon afterwards, the Zecklers and Transylvanians following the Example of the former, left the Army, and re∣turned to their Homes; the which Mis∣fortunes were soon seconded by the ill News, That 200 of his Men, who blocked up the Castle of Terezwar, had been sur∣prised, and cut to pieces by the Germans. After which, the Prince pursued Tekeli towards Czick,Tekeli flies from place to place. from whence likewise he decamped, and fled through the whole Country, being hunted from one place to another; but seeing that Tekeli could be fixed in no place, the Prince sent back all his Baggage to Medies; and having alarm'd Tekeli on every side, he caused all the Roads into the Georgian Country to be stopped up, and rendered unpassa∣ble; and being in a full march, and fresh pursuit after him, he almost surprized him, and had certainly taken him, had not the Prince been discovered in his passage over the River near Marienburg; at which Te∣keli
was so affrighted, that he betook him∣self to flight, and with great Confusion retired through the Pass of Bozz in Wa∣lachia;He flies into Wa∣lachia. but being still pursued by some German Horse, they overtook seven or eight Waggons with Baggage, which they seized with several Prisoners; but Tekeli staid in no place, but rode Post away un∣til he came as far as Tergovitz in Walachia. And thus ending the short Reign of this Transylvanian King, the Emperor became a second time the Master of that Principali∣ty; the Care and Preservation of which was committed to the Charge and Go∣vernment of General Veterani, who with eight Regiments, and a good part of the Army, returned back to Zatmar. According to Orders received from the Grand Vizier, Chusacin Pasha of Bosnia, appeared on the 29th of October, with Mustapha Pasha, and one Beg or Lord of that Country,Esseck summoned. before Esseck, with 12 or 15000 Men; and the day following sent a Summons to the Duke of Croy, to Sur∣render up the Fortress unto the invincible Power of his Sovereign, the Ottoman Em∣peror, and in failure of a ready Compli∣ance herewith, he threatned to destroy the whole Garrison, Man, Woman, and Child, and not so much as to spare or give Quarter to Infants in the Womb of their Mothers. Hereunto the Duke returned for Answer, That the Germans did not use to be terrified with high and menacing Words;The Answer to the Sum∣mons. That they had not a Woman in the Town, and conse∣quently no Children to be concerned for who were unborn; but they should find Men there who were resolved to defend the Town to the utmost of their power. Upon this Answer, the Pasha immedi∣ately stormed the Counterscarps, which were without any Parapet, and provided only with some small Pallisadoes:The Turks repulsed. How∣soever, tho' the Garrison consisted only of 2000 Men, the Turks were repulsed with great loss and slaughter. The Pasha find∣ing himself mistaken in his Measures, and that the place was resolved to make a bet∣ter resistance than he expected, he began to form an Attack in good Order, opening Trenches, and raising Batteries, which was performed with such diligence, that on the 2d of November,Novemb. two Batteries were finished, from whence with eight Guns, and two Mortar-pieces, they fired conti∣nually into the Town. The Duke one Evening walking with some Officers through the Pallisadoes to take a view of the Enemy, was discovered by them, and thereupon a whole Volley of shot was poured upon them; amongst which, one Musket-shot took of the Hat and Perri∣wig of the Duke, and grazing on his Fore∣head, took off the Skin for the breadth of a Finger, without other hurt or mischief. On the 4th about Noon the Duke caused a Salley to be made by 200 Foot,A Salley made from the Town. 30 Granadiers, and 100 Horse, which so well succeeded, that the Turks were beat∣en out of their Trenches, having 200 of their Men killed on the place, and five Standards taken, with the loss only of two Men killed and about 30 wounded: Had the Lieutenant who commanded the Horse, done his Duty, and advanced as he ought to have done, to cut off the Enemies Retreat, above 40 Colours had been taken, and not one of them had escaped out of their Trenches; for which Default the said Lieutenant was seized, and arrested. On the 5th, The Turks had advanced within 15 Paces of the Pallisadoes, and Counterscarp, and had so battered, and ruined the Houses within the Town, e∣specially that in which the Duke had his Quarters, that very few were standing, and scarce any place to remain or abide in. The Turks likewise began again to appear in great numbers, threatning a general Storm; But the Duke, and the other Generals, providing to make the best Resistance, and most vigorous Defence they were able, entered into the Counterscarps with un∣daunted Resolution; but the Enemy at∣tempted nothing, as if some strange fear had possessed them. In the mean time, the Duke being returned to his Lodgings, the Hussars brought to him three Turks; who being in Examination, demanded for what Reason the Enemies had made so vio∣lent an Assault without Trenches or Earth to cover them; it was answered, That there being a Report in the Army, that the Christians were coming with a power∣ful Army to relieve the Town; it was re∣solved to take the place, if possible, be∣fore the Succours came; for which reason they endeavoured to carry all at once, by dint of Sword, or force of Arms. The Duke, and General Staremberg ha∣ving received this Information,A strata∣gem to de∣ceive the Turks. sent out by Night all the Drums and Trumpets, and Bag-Pipes which were in the Town, to the Regiment of Hofkirchen, and some Hussars, which were quartered on this side of the Drave, with Orders and Instru∣ctions, that when the Evening was come, they should under the Obscurity of the Night, march to and fro, causing the marches of Musqueteers, and Dragoons, at convenient distances to be beaten, and Trumpets and Kettle-Drums to be sounded from several Places; which being exactly performed according to Orders, caused
such an Alarm in the Turkish Camp, as struck all with Fear and Confusion, be∣lieving that the Succours, which they feared,It succeeds to the ter∣rour of the Turks. were now arrived, which caused such a Consternation in the Turkish Camp, that they quitted all their Trenches in the Night with a confused Precipitation, ma∣king what haste was possible for Bosnia. Of this the Besieged knew as yet no∣thing, but perceiving towards six a Clock in the Morning, that not the least noise was heard in the Turkish Trenches, the Duke gave 50 Dollars to a Musketeer to adventure out, and take a view of the Camp and Trenches; the which having done, he returned, and gave a Report, That not a Turk was remaining, either in one or the other.The Turks raise the Siege by a pannick fear. So soon as the Day-broke, the Garrison sallied out, and en∣tered the deserted Camp, in which they found great Spoils, three pieces of Can∣non, 100 Bombs, and other warlike In∣struments which the Turks had left behind in their affright, which possessed them with such pannick Fear, that they stopped not, or looked behind them, till they had pas∣sed the Bridges at Walcowar, where they stayed no longer than only to break them down to secure their flight. The Story hereof was pleasantly related by a certain German, who had three years before been taken by the Turks, and had for his skill in the Turkish Language, been received into Service of the Pasha's Secre∣tary: This Man during the flight had thrown himself into a Cock of Hay and Straw, where he lay hidden until the Turks were gone, and then creeping out, escaped to Esseck, and there told the Duke; That the asha was a dull, old, timorous Fellow; who when he heard all the Drums beat, and the Trumpets and Bagpipes sound, he was struck with so much Fear, that he trembled, his Hands and Feet shook, his Knees knocked one against the other, and his Legs were not able to sup∣port his Body; and he farther said, That the Pasha had been ordered by the Grand Vizier, that so soon as he had made him∣self Master of Esseck, that he should not stop there, but should make Excursions round the Country, ruining and destroy∣ing all with Fire and Sword; but this Stra∣tagem so well succeeded, that the People and Country were freed of the Turks, and the Ruin which they threatned. The Siege being thus raised, Lieutenant Colonel Lyon was dispatched with the News to the Imperial Court;Joy at Vi∣enna. which so much rejoyced the Emperor and the whole City, that all the former sinister Successes of the Campagne seemed forgotten, and swallowed up in the Joy of this Action; for which the Duke of Croy, and General Staremberg were so cryed up, that never any thing seemed comparable to this Stra∣tagem, and gained them not only the Fame of valiant, but wise Generals: This News was the more wellcome, because it was surprizing, and unexpected; for the Town was so ill fortified, that the Sol∣diers would never have been perswaded to hold out, had not the Duke liberally di∣stributed his Money in the Garrison, and treated the Soldiers plentifully at the Rate of a Pound of Flesh, and a Quart of Wine for every Day; And indeed there was a necessity thereof in that moist Country, which is nothing but marshy and wet Places, and in that Season of the Year, subject to Rain, Fogs, Frost, and all ex∣tremities of the Weather. Thus this Siege being happily raised, Te Deum was sung in Esseck; and all the Trenches of the Enemy being levelled, the Duke committed the Command of the Town to General Staremberg, and returned himself to Vienna. In the mean time, Prince Lewis conti∣nued his march for Zatmar, where he ar∣rived the first of December,Decemb. having been Complimented all along in his march by the States of Transylvania;P. Lewis complimen∣ted by all the States of Tran∣sylvania. particularly at Enget, where Thanks were particularly re∣turned him, for having delivered them from the Tyrannical Government of Count Tekeli: Which poor Prince, after many Difficulties, being come into Walachia, 300 Zecklers which had followed him did then Desert him; but marching home without leave, were pursued by some of his Troops, and cut down in such manner, that none of them escaped. The Walachians also, unwilling to have their Country ruined by the Rascians,C. Tekeli in a sad Cndition. who designing to make their Winter-quarters there, caused great Fears, so that he laboured under perpetual Trou∣bles and Hardships. At Zatmar, Prince Lewis was forced to continue for some Days for Refreshment, both of his Soldiers, Horses, and Mules, the which were so extreamly tired by their long Marches, especially the Beasts which had carried the Baggage, that they would not stir nor rise, until they put fire under them. In the mean time the Turks under the Command of the Grand Vizier's Son, con∣tinued to over-run and spoil all the Coun∣try on the other side of the Theysse, and sent a Summons to the Governor of St. Job to Surrender the place to them; but he answered, That the Place being a Fortress belonging to the Emperor, of which Ge∣neral Nigrelli had the Keys, he was not capacitated to comply with their Desires.
Hereof News being brought to Prince Lewis at Zatmar, who had not with him above 2000 good Horse; the Enemy be∣ing 15000 strong,P. Lewis prepares to fight the Turks. did no think himself in a Condition to fight them, but sending to Colonel Schick, who with his Regiment was quartered near Zolnock, and to the Hussars who were in those parts, to joyn as speedily as they could possibly with him, and to put themselves into a posture to meet and fight the Enemy. Whilst things were forming and contriving for this Action, a certain stout Fellow, who used to go out upon Parties, named Kis Ballad, had a Rencounter with the Tartars in the Parts adjacent, of whom he killed 100, and took 50 Prisoners. Of this Body, those that escaped carried News to the Turks and Tartars, that the Prince had quitted Transylvania, and lay encamped near Zatmar; upon which Advice, 12000 Turks made an Excursion into that Coun∣try: But Prince Lewis having now got together 4000 good Horse, adventured to seek the Enemy; and on the 20th of this month came to Claussenburg, where two Days before the Turks had been, and sum∣moned the place to make a Surrender; but the Summons being rejected, the Turks having burned the Suburbs, returned to Enget, and in their march passing in fight of Claussenburg, they burnt and destroyed all Places in their way, and attacked the Foragers, and advanced Guards; took some few German Prisoners, with the loss only of about 50 of their Men, and so marched directly towards Temeswaer: But Prince Lewis having been joyned by Ge∣neral Nigrelli with 2000 Horse,The Turks return with loss to Te∣meswaer. by which and his own he made a Body of 4000 well armed and accoutred, he pursued them so closely at the Heels, that the E∣nemy entirely quitted Transylvania, with the greatest haste and confusion imaginable; and falling in with their Rear, cut down about a 1000 of their Men, took three pieces of Cannon, with a great many Camels and Horses, and most of their Baggage; and hasting away with all the speed possible, more in the Nature of a Flight than a Retreat, they at length arri∣ved at emeswaer, but with much diminu∣tion of their numbers, caused by toilsome and long Marches, and the excessive Colds in the Night, whereby some were frozen to Death, and others seized by Catarrhs and Rheums, which made them uncapable of farther Service. After this,Orsoua surrendred to the Turks. the Island of Orsoua surren∣dred to the Turks for want of Ammunition; the Governor upon the Articles granted, desired to be conducted to Belgrade, not knowing but that it remained still in the hands of the Germans; and tho' the Turks told him the contrary, yet not believing them, he still persisted so earnestly to be Convoyed to Belgrade, that the Turks at length carried him and his People thither, consisting of 600 Men, besides Women and Children; but this mistrust of the Turks words cost them dear, for arriving there, they were put for two days into a Fort of the City, and afterwards comman∣ded them to bring out their Arms, and lay them upon Waggons, on promise of send∣ing them for Esseck, which being done, they commanded them to come forth two by two, that they might be the better counted. After which, they drove them back to the Fort like Cattle, and chained them there with Iron-Chains, where they kept them in so severe an Imprisonment, that most of them died with Want and Hunger, except such as were under 20 years of Age, whom they Shaved and Circumcised, and made Turks; but the Women and Children they Sold, and pil∣laged all the Goods, which they brought out with them. In this Island the Enemies found 23 great Guns, 15 Field-pieces, and three Mortars, but the Bombs and Powder were thrown into the River: And thus ended this Year, which proved the most unfortunate to the Emperor of any, that had happened since the beginning of this War.
THE Venetian Successes In Their WAR against the TURKS, In the Year 1690. WE concluded the Venetian Suc∣cesses of the last Year's Ex∣pedition, with the Trium∣phant, and Glorious Entry of that Illustrious Prince Francisco Morosini Cavalier, Captain General, and Elected Doge of Venice, to whom his Country te∣stified as much Honour and Glory as could be contrived and expressed; the Particulars of which are long and not necessary to be inserted in this History; only it may not be improper to recount in short some of the Exploits of this Great Man, with that Ap∣plause which is due unto his Memory. This Francisco Morosini descending from the most Ancient Patrician Family in Ve∣nice, was Born in the Year 1618. He was in his Infancy dedicared by his Parents to the Service of his Country, and educated in all Martial Exercises; and rising by degrees and steps to several Offices, both Military and Civil, he at length arrived at the Su∣pream degree of Government in that Repub∣lick, being elected Doge during the time that he was fighting abroad in defence of his Country, he was at first made a Noble Commander of a Gally, which is the first step and degree which a Noble Venetian takes, then he was made a Vice-Admiral and Governour of a Galleass; next Cap∣tain of the Golf, Proveditor-General of the Arms in Candia, and then Captain General, in which Office he continued a long time until the Year 1661, behaving himself with incomparable Valour; in which Year he fought a Battle with the Gallies of Barbary, under the Fortress of Valona, he took a great Ship called a Sultana, richly laden from Egypt, near the Island of Milo, he defended the Breaches of Candia, and took another great Sultana,The At∣chiev∣ments of Francisco Morosini. the Captain of which was called Admiral Nicolo of Nadalin Fur∣lano, and made him Prisoner; he laid the Captain Pasha's Gally Aboard, and almost entirely ruined it; he took the Gally of the Pasha of Cyprus, together with the se∣veral Fortresses of Calamo, Egena, Volo and Megara; and having made himself Master of those Seas, he destroyed 13 Galleots under the Fortress of Prevesa. He made many Sallies from Candia in the Face of the Enemy, destroying many of their Works and Intrenchments; he subdued the For∣tress of Calamata, and made himself Master of two Turkish Gallies commanded by Hali Pasha; he also took the Fortresses of Toron, Chisme, Castel-rugio, and Schiato, putting them and other Islands under Contribution. He also took the Castle of Capricorno, and destroyed the Forts of Calogero, Sancta Ve∣neranda, and Calami, which commanded the Fortress of Suda. He likewise took two Ships bound from Alexandria, laden with Soldiers and Provisions, with another Con∣voy bound from the same Place for Constan∣tinople, under which were divers Ships and Vessels. In fine, after all these Successes and Tri∣umphs, being returned to Venice, he was made Proveditor of Friuli to oppose the In∣cursions of the Turks, who at that time threatned those Countries very much; but those Fears being blown over, he was sent back a second time to Command both the Seas, and me City of Candia, then streight∣ly Besieged by the Grand Vizier Kupriogli, with the main force of the Ottoman Empire; the which Siege having continued for the space of almost three Years,The Praises of Moro∣sini. the Turks were concluded to have lost 128000 Men before it. During which time this Hero behaved himself with all imaginable Wisdom and Bravery; and tho' at length he was forced after many Conflicts, and various Succes∣ses (which we have distinctly recounted in our History of the Lives of the three last Emperors,) yet the fame of that renowned Defence, accompanied with an ensuing
Peace, will much more immortalize his Fame than any other of his Martial Succes∣ses, it being the most memorable Siege that ever happened in the World. Finally in the Year 1683, when the Grand Vizier Kara Mustapha appeared be∣fore Vienna with an Army of 200000 Men, he was then appointed Proveditor-General of Friuli, to oppose the vast Inundations of the Turks, which had happened to all those Countries, had the Success of that Vizier answered the Expectations of so mighty a Power. After which he was sent a third time in quality of Captain-General against the Turks in the Morea, where in the space of five Years, he performed all those great Actions which have been before recounted; by which he acquired such immortal Honour and Fame, that he was by the Death of Con∣tareno, exalted to the Supream Throne of that Victorious and Renowned Republick; where we shall now leave him employed in the exercise of the Sublime Dignity, and so proceed to recount the Actions of that No∣ble General the Cavalier and Procurator Girolamo Cornaro, who when the Doge, a∣bout the latter end of the last Year, re∣turned to Venice, was left in the Command before Malvasia, of the Blockade, which continued during the whole Winter past. But the Summer coming on, and the Ar∣my and Navy reinforced considerably with Men, Provisions, and Money, dispatched from Venice under several strong Convoys, and being joyned with the Pope's and the Maltese Gallies, it was proposed to convert the Blockade into a Formal Siege. It was now full 17 Months, that the Besieged had with much patience stood out in defence of their City, so that it was believed, that they were reduced to the utmost Point of Famine, and Penury;The Vene∣tians re∣solve to be∣siege Na∣poli di Malvasia. the which Opinion, the Turks were willing to confirm in the Minds of the Besiegers, that they might take them off from the Attempts of Attacking, Bombing, or other Methods for forcing the Town. But the Captain-General having discovered, that the Defendants were still provided for a longer Subsistence, and able to hold out for some Months, resolved on some more expedite means, than by the dilatory ways of a Siege, and the lazy Formalities of a Blockade; for tho' it was most desirable for sparing the effusion of Christian Blood to take it, by safe and certain Proceedings; yet when it was made known, that the Vi∣ctuals, and all sorts of Provisions, did not fail; it came to a final Determination, to take them by a lively and vigorous force: To which end the Engenier Bassignani, with the Count St. Felice Sergeant-General, was ordered to take a Survey of the Town on the Lands side, and to design, and draw out the Trenches, and Platforms for Battery,The Town battered. the which in a few Days, by the encourage∣ment which the Presence of the Captain-General gave, was performed and perfected; so that they began on all sides, with the ad∣vantage of two Palanders, to batter the Town, and with their great Guns from the Ships and Gallies, to thunder in such a ter∣rible manner, that the Inhabitants dismay∣ed, and dis-spirited by their long Suffer∣ings, and the unexpected Attacks of their Enemies, caused their Drums to beat a Par∣ly, and sent forth a Cadi, with two Aga's, to make Offers of Surrender on these Con∣ditions, viz. That they might carry off all their Cannon,They Capi∣tulate. and have 20 Days given them to make a Surrender. But these Propositions appearing unrea∣sonable, they were without farther Dis∣course, or Expostulation dismissed, and sent back to the City. The Inhabitants tired with the long Blockade of 16 Months, and fearing now a forcible Assault, after some Consultation held amongst themselves, they resolved to deliver up the City, and returned the same Messengers with these more reasonable Con∣ditions. The Articles agreed. I THAT the City should be Deli∣vered. II. The Soldiers and Inhabitants should go forth with their Goods, and Baggage, in the space of 10 Days, and safe Convoy given them to be Transported to Can∣dia. III. Liberty given to the Inhabi∣tants, either to remain in the City, or depart. In vertue of these Articles, 1200 Souls marched out of the City, a great part of which were Men.Malvasia delivered up. In the Town they left 78 Pieces of Cannon, part of Brass, and part of Iron, with great Quantities of Bi∣sket, and with other Provisions, and Am∣munition, sufficient for several Months. The People having quitted the City, and Transported as was agreed to Candia, the Captain-General entered into it with much Pomp and Triumph on the 12th of August, where the principal Mosch being dedicated to God under the Invocation of the Blessed
Virgin of Carmen, was delivered up to the care of the Franciscan Fathers, and a suffi∣cient Garrison being put therein, the Com∣mand thereof was committed to the Go∣vernment of that Noble, Venetian, Vicenzo Gritti of St. Alvise, in quality of Provedi∣tor. Many Gentlemen signalized their Va∣lour and Conduct in subduing this Fortress, namely the Duke of Guadagni, Chabrillan General of Malta, with several other Noble Persons, and Subaltern Officers, worthy of immortal fame. In this last Action, 400 Men were killed and wounded. By the Fall of this City of Malvasia, ta∣ken the 12th of August, the Turks were en∣tirely beaten out of the Morea, and the Ve∣netians became absolute Masters thereof: But to lose no farther time, the Captain-General Cornaro having given some time for the Refreshment of his Troops, fet sail from Malvasia with the whole Armata,The Vene∣tians de∣sign upon Valona. to∣wards the Gulf; and being on the 11th of September come within sight of Valona, the Turks had time to form a Body of 7000 Foot,Septemb. and 1500 Horse; and having taken possession of the most advantageous Posts, and Passes, they endeavoured vigorously to dispute the Landing of the Venetians. But things were so well ordered, that nothing could give a stop to the Resolution of Men accustomed to Success and Victory. They Land.The first that set Footing on Shoar, were the Malteses, which were followed by the Pope's Militia; but the Venetians were the first to attack the Enemy under Command of Major-General Spaar; which they per∣form'd with so much Bravery and Resoluti∣on, that having repulsed the Enemy from the Shoar, they pursued them to the For∣tress of Cannina, which is situate on the top of a high and craggy Rock, about four Italian Miles distant from Valona; these were seconded by the Duke of Guadagni, and several other Auxiliary Troops, toge∣ther with some Venetian Troops command∣ed by Sergeant-General Borri; in this Acti∣on the Turks lost some Men, and the Vene∣tians about 8 or 10, amongst which the Count of St. Felice was shot in the Head by a Musket-Bullet. The Army being also joyned with a Body of Cimarriotes, and Albaneses, and conside∣rably increased thereby, advanced so far, as to lodge that Night in the Neighbour∣hood, designing next Morning to attack the Suburbs of the Town, whilst Lavettin, Ge∣neral of the Descent, was taking a Survey of its Situation, he was grievously wound∣ed with a Musket-shot; and in the mean time the Turks making a Sally with 2000 Men, were repulsed, and forced to retire into their Houses fortified with Stone, bar∣ricading up their Streets, and in many Pla∣ces opening Trenches to give a stop to the advanced Troops of the Enemy, by which the Captain General foreseeing that length of time might be advantageous to the E∣nemies, which in a short time expected new Forces; the Cannon, Bombs, and other Warlike Instruments, were sent for from the Fleet, which was performed with so much diligence,Cannina battered. that in the space of 24 Hours, the great Cannon was brought, and some Batteries raised, to the great Admira∣tion and Terrour of the Enemy, against the Fortress of Cannina; in the expedition of which Work, all the Ciurma, that is, the Slaves of the Gallies and Galleasses, were greatly serviceable, by mending and break∣ing the Ways to make them passable for the Artillery; but whilst the Batteries were playing very hotly on Cannina, a strong Party of 3000 Foot, and 400 Horse, were detached under Command of General Spaar, to attack the Enemy, who had made a Re∣treat, after the late Repulse upon the Sea-coasts, into some fortified Houses and Pla∣ces of Retirement. Spaar having marched for the space of 10 Miles through Woods, and Mountains, and difficult Places,The Turks overthrown in the Field. came at length in sight of the Enemy, who were possessed with such Fear and Consternation, that tho' at first they made an appearance of Fighting, yet upon a more near Approach, they turned their Backs, and fled with Shame and Confusion. In the mean time whilst General Spaar was in pursuit of the Enemy, General Borri, with several others of the chief Officers, made an Attack upon the Fort, without any fear or regard to the continual Fire which was made from thence, and being seconded at the same time by the Duke of Guadagni, together with the Malteses and the Troops of the Religion, and of the Papalins, or the Pope's Forces; they all in their several Sta∣tions assaulted the Places appointed to them, and in this general Storm the Auxiliaries forced into the middle of the Town, sepa∣rating the Defendants on the Right Hand from those of the Left,The Fort of Cannina capitulates who finding them∣selves distressed on all sides, spread a White Flag, demanding to Capitulate; the which being granted, some Persons came forth de∣manding such exorbitant Terms, as were not thought fit to be granted. At length all was reduced to these Particulars; namely, That they should, without further de∣lay, Surrender the Fortress into the Hands of the Venetians, and march forth immediately with their Families, Bag and Baggage.
Thus was the Fortress of Cannina deli∣vered up to the Will and Pleasure of the Captain-General,Cannina surrendred. out of which came forth about 3000 Souls, besides 546 of the Gar∣rison, and were with safe Convoy conduct∣ed to their Camp: The loss on the Veneti∣an side was not considerable as to the Num∣bers, but for the Quality of the Persons killed and wounded, amongst which Alvise Sagredo was wounded with a Musquet-Bul∣let in the Thigh; and General Borri through the Body,Persons of Quality illed. of which he died, to the great Sorrow and Lamentation of the whole Ar∣my; likewise Monsieur de Moroglie, Lieu∣tenant General of the Forces of Malta, whose Place was supplied by Sergeant-Major de Brossie, a Person of approved Va∣lour, and prudent Conduct. The Captain-General not being willing to lose the favourable advantage of the present Consternation the Enemy was in, their Army being beaten in the Field, and put to flight, and the Fortress of Cannina deliver∣ed, and the Cannon for several Batteries playing upon the Town of Valona, it was thought fit to make ah appearance of the whole Army before the City, and to af∣fright them the sooner into a Surrender, a threatning Summons was sent them, with Menaces of giving no Quarter in case of Refusal; but hereunto no Answer was re∣turned by the Turks, so that nothing but an obstinate Resistance was expected, all things being silent and quiet in the Town, during the whole Night: At length in the Morning the like Quietness and Silence con∣tinuing, it was discovered, that the Turks had privately in the Night conveyed them∣selves away,The Turks abandon Valona. and cowardly abandoned the Town to the Pleasure and Will of their E∣nemies, on the 18th of September 1690. In the Fortress of Cannina, and in the Town of Valona, 134 Pieces of Cannon were taken of several sorts of Metal, as well of Brass as of Iron. And in this manner this Enterprize end∣ing, to the great Glory of the Venetian Arms, Te Deum was sung in Venice with much Joy and Triumph, and greatly to the Honour and Praise of the Captain-General Cornaro, who with equal Valour followed the Footsteps of his fortunate Predecessor Morosini. Nor were the Venetian Arms less success∣ful under the Command of General Molino in Dalmatia,The Pasha of Arzi∣govina, designs on the Greeks where Zenalee the Pasha of Arzigovina, had a design with a Body of 3000 Horse and Foot, to attack the new Subjects lately conquered by the Venetians, the which being for the most part Christians of the Greek Church, it was resolved to sur∣prize them in the Easter Week, when they were more attentive to Devotion, than to the Exercise of their Arms; but this De∣sign was not so secretly managed, but that it was discovered, and brought to the know∣ledge of Pietro Duodo, Proveditor Extraor∣dinary of Cataro, who upon the News, im∣mediately dispatched by an Express, an In∣formation thereof to the People of Nixichi, advising them to be watchful against the Surprizes of their Enemy.He attacks Nixichi. Accordingly at the time appointed, the Pasha moving from Nevissigne, entering into the adjacent Parts of Nixichi, began to execute all Acts of Hostility, burning Houses and Villages, making Slaves, and taking a considerable Booty. The News hereof being brought to the Churches, where the People were assembled and intent at their Devotions, they all ran out of their Churches, and be∣took themselves to their Arms, with such wonderful Celerity and Resolution, that they unexpectedly assailed the Turks, and after a sharp Conflict routed them,Is beaten off. and put them to Flight. The Pasha endeavouring to stop their Career, killed two of his af∣frighted Officers with his own Hand; but Fear and Consternation had so possessed their Minds, that nothing could give a hin∣drance or stop to their Course; for all be∣ing in Confusion, they trampled one on the other, and in the Pursuit 400 Foot, and 300 Horse were cut to pieces; the Slaves which they had taken, were set at liberty, and the Booty recovered; many Prisoners were taken, amongst which were some principal Turks, with the Pasha himself, who being put into Chains, offered 3000 Zechines, with two Vests of Sables for his Ransome, with some fine Horses, and Arms of considerable value; but the People of Nixichi were too generous to accept of a Ransome,The Pasha taken Pri∣soner. and rather chose to carry their Prisoner in Triumph unto Cataro, than to accept of any Present whatsoever in lieu thereof. From Cataro, by order of Gene∣ral Molino, the Pasha was on a Gally tran∣sported to Spalatro. And least the Turks of Arzigovina being hereby incensed, should be provoked to take a Revenge with greater force, the General Molino, for better secu∣rity of that People, ordered the Comman∣der of that District to march with a Body of 300 Men to their assistance, and to put all People into Arms; that taking advantage on the present Consternation with which the Turks were affected, they might with more ease enjoy the lasting Fruit of the pre∣sent Victory. With like happy Success was the strong Fortress of Filiporich situate in the Neigh∣bourhood of Glamoz in Dalmatia,Filipo∣rich taken. taken and destroyed, by order of Molino directed to the Proveditor of Knin, who accordingly executed the same with such Prudence,
and Vigour, that having dis-speeded 500 Men, to a Place called Dervis, their for∣tune was to take 60 Turks, which kept the Towers, Houses, and Moschs within that Precinct, together with four small Guns, some Musketoons, Colours, and other Arms of the Turks, as also a considerable number of Cows and Sheep; they also burnt three great Villages belonging to the Turks, consisting of 500 Houses, and took 32 Slaves. Thus had all the Adventures of this Year answered the Expectations of the Ve∣netians at Land, better than those of the Germans had done at the Court at Vienna; but yet an unhappy Encounter at Sea, gave the Turks some cause to rejoyce, and not a little tempered the Triumph of the Veneti∣ans; the which happened in this man∣ner. About the opening of the Campaign on the 22th of March of this Year, the Cap∣tain-General gave Orders to Admiral Valier Commander of the Ship St. Iseppo, carrying 44 Brass Guns, that taking with him for his Confort,A Sea-Fight. the Ship called the St. Mark; he should sail to Milo, there to collect the usual Charach, or Tribute of that Island, being about 10000 Dollars a Year: And being towards the Evening come near the Island, a strong Gale of contrary Winds, put them off from the Shoar, driving them towards Candia, and so continued until Midnight, when the Wind abating, and the Weather becoming more favourable, they directed their Course towards the Island. The two Ships, St. Iseppo, & St. Mark, attack d by 10 Tur∣kish Ves∣sels.Upon Break of Day 10 Ships were dis∣covered so near, that they were easily known to be Enemies; at which Alarm the Matches were lighted, and the Ships fitted, and all prepared for a Fight: These 10 Ships proved to be Soltano's, Commanded by Mezzo Morto, a famous Pyrate belong∣ing to Algier, of which he became Dey and Captain, which having carried the usual Present to the Sultan, was some time after∣wards Captain-Pasha of the Grand Seigni∣or's Fleet. Now returning back to Algier, and un∣happily meeting with these two Ships in their way, six of them invested the St. Isep∣po; and the other four undertook the St. Marco, a Ship of 60 Brass Guns: After some Hours Fight, an unlucky Shot from the Enemy entered the Powder-Room of the St. Mark, with which the Ship blew up, and thereby the Soldiers and Seamen, with all the Equipage were lost,The St. Mark blown up. and that brave Ship entirely perished. Hereupon the whole Number of the 10 Ships uniting to∣gether, fell upon the St. Iseppo, which su∣stained the Conflict valiantly for the whole Day, and making a running Fight, was in hopes, by the sound of the Guns, to call out some help from the Fleet, which lay then at Napoli di Malvasia; but no Suc∣cour coming, Admiral Valier entered the Line into the midst of the Enemies, where by some unlucky Shots, the Masts and Helm, or Rudder were shot away. In this distressed Condition was Admiral Valier, when still fighting with his Sword in his Hand upon the Quarter-Deck, he called to him his Lieutenant, Captain Petrina, and made him swear, That whensoever he was dead, he would blow up the Ship, rather then render it up into the Hands of the Turks; then he threw Overboard all his Publick Letters, Orders, and Instructions, as also all the Flags and Colours in which the Lion and Arms of St. Mark were de∣scribed, that nothing which belonged to the Republick, might fall into the Hands of the Enemy; and consequently he cau∣sed both the Pumps to be unfixed, that the Vessel might sink, and not fall into the Hands of the Turks. And afterwards see∣ing two of the Enemies Ships preparing to come Aboard, he called to those few of his Men, who were left alive, and coming on the Quarter-Deck, animated them to stand by him, and whensoever those two Ships were aboard, to give Fire to the Powder, and perish with the Enemies on either hand: But whilst Valier was giving these Instru∣ctions,Valier killed. he was taken off by a Cannon-Bul∣let, and immediately, as he had ordered, his Body was cast into the Sea, having pro∣tested, That neither Alive, nor Dead, would he fall into the Hands of the Ene∣my. Valier being dead, and his Lieutenant, Captain Petrina grievously wounded, and very few Soldiers and Seamen remaining alive, or unwounded, and the Ship after a whole Days fight, entirely disabled to make any longer resistance; the Turks howsoever durst not adventure to come near the Ship, but at length displaying White Colours, they adventured to lay the Ship aboard with their Long-Boar, where being enter∣ed, they enqured first for the Admiral, and his Lieutenant, and being informed, that the first was killed, and his Corps thrown Overboard, and the latter mortally wounded, they made Prisoners of all those remaining alive in the Ship; and having demanded of Petrina the reason why he had with such obstinacy fought against 10 Ships? He answered, That it was not accustomary to suffer the Ships belonging to the Repub∣lick, to fall into the Hands of the Enemy; and that in case he had not been wounded, he would have blown the Ship up, rather than have seen the Turks become Masters of her: In fine, whilst the Turks were Aboard,
Pillaging and Plundering what they could find,The St. Iseppo sinks. about four Hours in the Night the Ship sunk with all the Cannon; only some few Seamen and Soldiers getting the Skiff, when it was very Dark, made their way for Milo, where finding a French Tartana, they were thence transported to the Arma∣ta. This Fight, tho' unfortunate, was yet Glorious to the Venetians; and for that rea∣son, tho' it happened at the beginning of the Year, we shall yet in honour to that Re∣publick conclude their Campaign with this glorious Action, and proceed to the next Year; in which we shall find the Imperial Forces much more fortunate, and crowned with Glory and Success, than in the pre∣ceeding Year. Anno 1691. THE Turks having the last Year re∣gained Nissa, Widin, and Belgrade, with some other Advantages, began to re∣cover their Courages, which before were sunk very low, and would gladly have ac∣cepted any tolerable Conditions of Peace whatsoever; but now as there was no speak∣ing thereof on less Terms, than a Surrender of all that the Emperor had conquered and gained from the Turks in Hungary; so this Resolution was heightned and confirmed in them by the Mediation which the Ambassa∣dors of England and Holland had offered and pressed upon them;The Turks despise a Peace. wherefore the War going forward, the Grand Seignior returned to pass his Winter at Constantinople, where, and in the Black-Sea, six or eight great Ships were put on the Stocks, to serve the next Summer against the Venetians, on the Coast of Morea, with which addition to their Naval Force, they hoped to over∣match the Venetian Fleet, and do great Feats on the Coast of Morea. The En∣glish Trade in a bad condition.In the mean time the English Trade in Turkey was in a most unhappy and unfor∣tunate Condition; for it had not been long since the terrible, and affrighting Earth∣quake, which had about two Years before, (as we have already related) destroyed the whole City of Smyrna; and by an irrupti∣on of Fire, consumed vast quantities of Goods belonging to the English Levant Company; and what was of great Consi∣deration, the Books, Accounts, and Papers of the Merchants perished with them. Af∣ter this amazing Judgment of God, the War breaking out between England and France, the Navigation for Merchant-Ships, both in the Mediterranean Seas, and in the Ocean, became very hazardous, especially for Ships of so great a value, as those from Turkey, which were sufficient to open the Eyes, and tempt the Avarice of the French at the Ex∣pence of a strong Fleet to lie in wait, and watch for them, of which the Interested were so sensible, that some of the Ships lay two Years at Smyrna,The Tur∣key Trade in a bad condition. before they could take the Courage and Resolution to adven∣ture on so hazardous a Voyage; but Ne∣cessity having no Law, for they must either perish in Port, or proceed, in which doubt∣ful case they chose the latter, and with the Blessing of God arrived safe at Leghorn; where having joyned a strong Squadron of 16 Men of War commanded by Sir Francis Wheeler, they proceeded for England, and some of the Merchant-men being stout Ships, and of considerable defence, they esteemed themselves equal to any force the French could send against them: But whilst they sailed forward without fear of any dan∣ger from their Enemies, the French having had Advice of all their Motions, and of that great Treasure they carried, thought it a Prize fit for their Royal Navy, and ac∣cordingly dis-speeded Monsieur Tourville, with all their great Ships out of Brest, to cruise upon them, and so well timed their Affair, that they had certainly taken sight of them, had it not pleased God to cover them with a thick Mist,The Tur∣key Ships arrive in England. which lasted until such time, as they were out of their reach, and having a prosperous Wind, arrived safe in England in the Month of July, to the great Joy and Triumph of the Mer∣chants. But to proceed to the Wars in Hungary?January. Count Tekely in the beginning of the Month of January appeared with a good Body of Men at the Passage of Terez, against whom the Prince of Hanover was detached with a strong Party;The Prince of Hano∣ver killed. but he being of a Valiant and a warm Spirit, natural to that most Il∣lustrious Family, advanced so far with a few Men before his Troops, that unex∣pectedly he fell into an Ambuscade which lay hidden and covered in Hedges and Bushes; where receiving a whole Volley of Small-shot, he was with one of his Men, (who died by his side) pierced with several Bullets near a Village called Sernist, and tho' the General followed close afterwards with a strong Body, yet he came too late to save this Hopeful and Gallant Prince, tho' not to repulse the Enemy, who at the noise of his coming, fled with all the precipitate haste they were able. But Colonel Pohland was more successful in his Undertaking; for he having given Orders to Antonio the chief Captain of the Rascians, to drive away all the Cattle which were grazing about the Castle of Facket, and whilst he was executing the same, the Turks sallied out upon him with all their force, but with such ill success, that being
beaten, and forced to retire unto their Ca∣stle; Pohland and his Men rushed in with them at the same time,Facket taken and burned. and cut down 500 of their best well-mounted Spahees, besides the Foot belonging to the Garrison, which was surrounded with a double Ditch, and beset with Palisadoes; the which having plundered, they afterwards Burnt, and left it. This Success was seconded by another upon the Palanca, or Fort called Waradin; in which was a Guard of 200 Men, the which they stormed and entered,As also a Fort called Waradin. killed all the Garrison, and burnt the Fort, and treat∣ed it in the same manner as they had done Facket. After this Excursion Colonel Pohland ha∣ving retired to his Quarters to refresh his Men, the General of the Walachians gave a false Alarm near the Pass of Fackau; but in reality marched with most of his Troops to a Place called Karansebes, spoiling and destroying the Country round about; but Pohland having notice thereof, attacked them, and both he with his Dragoons, and Captain Antonio with his Rascians, attack∣ed the General so briskly, that he was forced to retreat with the loss of 300 of his Men, and of all the Spoil and Plunder which they had taken. In revenge hereof the Turks, and Tar∣tars consisting of a very strong Body, in∣tended to break into Transylvania by way of the Iron-Gate, of which Pohland and Antonio having notice, they posted them∣selves in such an advantageous place, that falling on them by way of Surprize, they routed them, and killed upwards of 1000 Men on the place, took more than 300 Prisoners, with much Baggage, Horses, and Booty. February.In the beginning of the Month of Febru∣ary, continual Skirmishes happened with various Successes, as if both sides intended to practise and exercise themselves against the time of the great Battle which was to be fought this Year at Salankement. In the first place the Garrison of Great Waradin made an Excursion towards Debre∣zin, and had the fortune to meet not far from thence, with a weaker Party of Ger∣mans and Hungarians, of which they killed several, and took 40 Prisoners; but they did not long enjoy the pleasure of this Suc∣cess; for Count Nigrelli having notice thereof, detached Lucas Janos, a Lieutenant Colonel of Horse, to pursue the Turks, whom he overtook and surprized in their Retreat,Some Turks of Great Waradin defeated. killed 200 of them, and released the 40 Prisoners, with about 450 Horse, which the Turks had taken in that Ad∣venture. Some other Turkish Parties had passed the Tiiscus upon the Ice, but were forced to retreat with great precipi∣tation. Likewise 400 Turks which had passed the Danube near Illock,Several Skirmishes. were met by 300 Rasci∣ans, under the Command of Captain Tosar, who killed about 140 of them, and took 40 more with three Standards, some good Horses, and other Booty. In like manner the Turks appeared with a Body of Men before the Castle of Novi,Novi de∣livered to the Turks. which they forced to surrender upon Capi∣tulations; but the Croats desirous to regain it, marched with a Body of Men towards the place; which the Turks with a like Body of Men resolved to oppose; whereupon a Fight ensued between these two little Ar∣mies, in which the Turks were worsted,The Turks worsted. 1000 of them being killed on the spot, many Pri∣soners taken, and amongst them a Pasha, with several other principal Turks. The Croats encouraged with this Success, prosecuted their design against Novi, and stormed the place; the which being provi∣ded with a strong Garrison, and fresh Troops marching for its relief, the Croats retired with their Prisoners and Booty, in very good order. The Turks more active, than fortunate, sallied out again this month from Lugos to pass the Marosch, and by the way upon the Ice, to make an Excursion into Tran∣sylvania. Colonel Pohland having notice hereof, designed with his 400 Dragoons joyned to the 1000 Rascians under Com∣mand of Antonio, to stop them in their march; and being advanced so far as Do∣bra, intelligence was given him, that the Enemy was returned to Lugos;The Garri∣son of Lu∣gos make a sally. upon which, being desirous to try his fortune, Pohland drew up his Regiment of 400 Men in view of the place, placing his Rascians in a certain Ambuscade, well co∣vered and undecerned; The Turks seeing so small a number drawn up before them, detached from the Town a Body of 700 Spahees, and 100 Tartars, to take a view of them: Upon appearance of this Party, the Dragoons retired to the Ambuscade, into which the Turks unwarily pursuing them, unhappily were fallen; and seeing their danger, betook themselves to a pre∣cipitate and disorderly flight towards their Forts; but being closely pursued,Are put to flight. the Rascians and Dragoons, entered the Pa∣lanca together with the Turks, cutting down and killing all that were before them. In this Confusion,The Town and Castle of Lugos taken. many of the Turks betook themselves to the Castle, but with so much haste, that they had not time to draw the Bridge up after them; so that the Rascians passing thereon, cut down one of the Ca∣stle Gates with their Battle-Axes; and be∣ing come to the last Gate, the Turks hung
out a white Flag, desiring to Capitulate; the which admitted of no long dispute, it being in a moment Agreed, That those who were in the Castle should have their Lives given them, and securely Convoyed to Temeswaer; there were remaining in all no more than 152 fighting Men, with their Tefterdar, or Treasurer, Bey or Go∣vernour of the Castle: Out of the whole number of 1000 effective Men, as they were before this fight began; the same according to Capitulation, were safely con∣ducted to Temeswaer; the remainder being 850, were killed in this Action; on the other side, 10 Germans were killed, and about 100 Rascians, besides the wounded; of which there were some Rascians, and 22 Germans, amongst which Pohland was shot through the Arm. In this place of Lugos, four Brass Guns, and one Mortar piece were taken with 15 Standards. After which 700 Rascians, and 100 Dragoons, were left for a Garrison in the place. The News of this Success encourage∣ing all the Imperialists round about, the Hungarians in the Garrison at Beche,The Garri∣son of Bech makes a Salley. about eight Leagues distant from Segedin, sallied out with a Party of Horse and Foot, and met a Party of Tartars, not far from Zat∣mar, pillaging and robbing the Country, the which he having attacked with great vigour, they returned with 200 Heads, to∣gether with two of their Captains Priso∣ners, and 300 Horses. Another Party of Hungarians of the Garison of Zento, met with a Party of 60 Turks, of which they killed 20, and made 40 Prisoners; and in their return they took the Palancha of Cariawiez, and killed all the People, and found a rich Booty in it. The Garri∣son of Se∣gedin sur∣prize Cho∣nad.The Garrison of Segedin being informed of all these Successes of their Neighbours, were resolved not to sit idle, but to try their fortune in the same manner; and accordingly by break of Day, attacked the City of Chonad, and entered it by surprize, before the Turks knew that their Enemy was near them: All in the Town were killed; and those in the Castle be∣ing terrified by the Flames round about them, abandoned the place the night fol∣lowing. These frequent Misfortunes of the Turks made them more cautious and circumspect in all their Motions for the future, reti∣ring and keeping themselves close in their strong Holds, and Fortresses. On the other side, the Imperial Court took all possible care to reinforce their Army, and make it more strong and numerous than it had been the last year: To which end, Orders were given to repair and strengthen the Fortifications of Buda and Esseck; and especially the latter, where the Coun∣terscarps were enlarged, and two whole, and two half Batteries were raised; and the Ice of the Danube, (for it was now the month of March) being thawed,March. the River was open to bring all necessary Ma∣terials for the Fortifications, whereby that work went on with all Diligence. This Employment did not hinder the Governor of Esseck from making some Attempts on the Turks; the which he prosecuted with some vigour, for having given Orders to a Captain of Walkowar, Percilia by Name, with 400 Hussars and Heydukes, to fall in∣to the Dominion of the Turks: He accor∣dingly surprized Irrick,Irrick sur∣prized, with much Booty taken. burnt and plun∣dered, and put all to Fire and Sword: He destroyed also the Neighbouring Vil∣lages, and cut down all the Turks and Tartars who had their Quarters in those Parts: In this Action Percilia got so con∣siderable a Booty, that he laded 70 Wag∣gons with the Spoil, besides a considera∣ble number of stately Horses; only 40 Turks of Note and Quality were made Prisoners; and several Standards, as a signal of Victory, were sent to Vienna. With this Booty, a great quantity of Copper-Money was taken for payment of the Turks and Tartars, together with 12000 Ducats in Gold, and 3000 in Silver, with Clothing for the Souldiers, and rich Ha∣bits belonging to the General Officers. The Report of this Action being noised abroad, a Pasha of that Country,A Pasha pursues them, but recires. called Kathana Mustapha, with 200 Horse pur∣sued and overtook them; but finding them too strong for him, and preparing to at∣tack him, he retired and saved himself in a Castle not far distant from thence. Nor was this all; for Percilia, meeting with another Party of Tartars, caused his Trum∣pets to sound a Turkish March: In answer to which, the Tartars called, and spoke to them in the Turkish Language, which Per∣cilia returned with good Blows, falling on them so suddenly,Percilia routs a Body of Tartars. that they entirely rout∣ed them, took all their Colours, and a good Booty, and released many Christians which had been enslaved by the Tartars; in which Action, and in the former, they killed 1200 Turks and Tartars, and so re∣turned safe with all their Prisoners and Booty to Walkowar and Esseck. A like Exploit was done by Antonio, Captain of the Rascians, who having joyned with 600 Heydukes, and 400 Hussars, at∣tacked a Castle, called Karakowar, a place situate on a high Rock, and by a Strata∣gem took it,Karako∣war taken. and found therein great quan∣tities of Corn; the which he distributed amongst his Men; only he put a Garrison into the place, and lest with
them 2000 Sacks of Corn for their Sub∣sistence. Tho' the Turks had the last year been more successful than they had been any time during the War; yet by their long and tedious Marches, and by the Losses they had sustained in small Parties before∣mentioned, they could not put themselves into a posture of taking the Field until the middle of the month of July: How∣soever, in the mean time, they made great preparations both by Land and Water; ordering their Troops from the remotest parts of Asia to march for Hungary; seve∣ral of their Ships laden with Ammunition and Provisions arrived at Widin, with de∣sign to transport the same to Belgrade, where the Magazine of Stores was to be made. Antonio, who was now made a Colonel, had notice hereof, and suffered two of their small Ships to pass by, with∣out interruption; herewith the Turks be∣ing encouraged, sent 10 more; but these Antonio attacked, and took two of them, and two more of them were taken by the Rascians near Modava, the rest returned back to Widin. May.These great Preparations made by the Turk obliged the Emperor to do the like; and accordingly a great Train of Artillery, with vast quantities of Ammunition, Bul∣lets, Bombs, and Carcasses, were sent down the River to Buda and Esseck; at the latter of which places the General Rendezvous of the Imperial Army was ap∣pointed. The Turks on the other side began to draw some Troops out of their Garrisons of Great Waradin and Temeswaer, consist∣ing of 200 Foot, and 1000 Horse, carry∣ing some great Guns with them in their march, seeming, as if they intended an Attempt upon Lugos, with hopes to sur∣prize it; of which Antonio having had some intelligence, happily met with them; and having a stronger Body of Horse and Dragoons, fell on the 200 Foot, and de∣feated them, killed 61 of them on the place, took some Prisoners, the rest saving themselves in the Marshes and Woods ad∣jacent: By some of these Prisoners, An∣tonio received Information, that the 1000 Horse were marched towards Lugos, and accordingly directing his Course thither, he surprized and took several of them who were separated from the rest; and causing all the Rascian Drums, Trumpets, and Kettle-Drums to sound, they struck such a Terrour in the Turks, that they fled from their several Quarters with such Con∣fusion, that dispersing themselves, many of them were taken, and amongst them, an Aga, with many other principal Turks. The time now approaching near for Acti∣on,1690. June. Count Guido of Staremberg drew out se∣veral Troops which were quartered in the Neighbourhood, into a Body; the other Troops which lay about Pest, where they had had their Winter-quarters, were drawn over to the opposite side, where joyning with those of Buda, they encamped at Souseberg: Whilst these Troops were draw∣ing together, a Party of Rascians surprized and took Titul, in which they found 400 Turks, and put them all to the Sword. In this interim, General Veterani received Intelligence, That 300 Ships laden with Provisions, under the Convoy of 4000 Men, were speedily designed from Widin to Belgrade, for subsistence of that place; and hereupon the General sent Orders to the Colonels, Pohland and Antonio, to in∣tercept them in their passage. These two Braves having joyned their Forces, ma∣king together 4000 Men, lay in wait for the Enemy about two days, and on the third, seeing them begin to appear, they drew their Forces so close together, that they seemed not to make above 400 Men in all: The Turks contemning so small a number, detached a Party of 1000 Jan∣nizaries to attack them; which running upon them with fury and precipitation, were so rudely treated by the Rascians, that the Turks were forced to send a stron∣ger Party to their assistance; the which also were so bravely received, that above 1000 Turks were killed on the place, and many drowned in their retreat; but the Ships betaking themselves to the other side of the River, were saved. Nor were the Rascians less fortunate, some days afterwards having taken 400 Waggons laden with Ammunition and Pro∣visions in their passage from Belgrade to Temeswaer, besides several Prisoners, a∣mongst which were three Turks of good Quality. Another strong Party of Rascians ma∣king an Incursion near Mitrovitz, attacked Kathana Mustapha, and killed 1500 of his Men on the place, took several Prisoners, four Guns, and all his Baggage; upon which the Turks quitting Mitrovitz, the Rascians entered and possessed themselves of it. These Successes being the Preludes to the ensuing Campagne, were good Omens of a happy and glorious Victory, the truth whereof will speedily appear, by what is to follow before the Conclusion of this Year. By all the Misfortunes which had at∣tended the Turks in this War, it was be∣lieved not only at Vienna, but concluded as well in England, as in all parts of Ger∣many,
that the Turks were become weary of the War,  and that there was nothing now wanting to beget a Peace, but a good Mediator acceptable to both the Emperor and the Sultan. The Turks had already given Proofs of their Inclinations to a Peace by the Ambassadors, which (con∣trary to the Custom of the Turks, and which had never been practised before) had sent their Ambassadors in a manner to supplicate Peace with the Emperor, and who remained still in the Imperial Domi∣nions, tho' confined to the Castle of Put∣tendorf, in the nature of Prisoners; the which was excused by the Austrians, by the constant practice of the Turks, who had for the most part Imprisoned Ambas∣sadors, or put Guards upon them, at all times when their Negotiations succeeded not; or that Propositions were offered not very pleasing to the Grand Seignior. But be it how it will, it being now evi∣dent, that both Parties had need of a Peace, no Princes appeared capable of the Office of Mediation, but only William King of Great Britain, and the States Ge∣neral of the United Provinces, being both Friends to the Port, and to the Emperor and his Allies. About that time, Sir William Trumball, sent by King James II. to reside Ambassa∣dor at Constantinople, being recalled, Sir William Hussey, one of the Members of the Turky Company,Sir Will. Hussey chosen Am∣bassador for Turky. was Elected by that Company, according to their Privileges, to reside Ambassador at the Ottoman Port: And being afterwards presented to His Majesty King William, to receive His Royal Consent and Confirmation, he was ac∣cepted by His Majesty, and received his Commission and Instructions accordingly; by which he was appointed in the Name of King William and Queen Mary, to Of∣fer unto the Sultan Their Majesties Medi∣ation. For better effecting of which, Sir Wil∣liam Hussey was appointed to take a Jour∣ney by Land to the Ottoman Port, and in his way to call at Vienna, there to receive such Directions about Treating this Peace as should be delivered him by the Emperor, the King of Poland, and the State of Ve∣nice, then in an Alliance together. Sir William Hussey not leaving England until the latter end of the year 1690. and having his Lady, with her Women in his Company, he arrived not at Vienna until the beginning of the Winter; when the Danube being frozen up, and no passage without great danger by Land; and the Instructions according to the slow Motions of the Imperial Court not formed, nor de∣livered to the hands of Sir William Hussey until towards the Spring; he arrived not at Adrianople till the Month of June, where the Grand Vizier was still remaining, and preparing for his march with the Army to∣wards Belgrade. But before he departed, he first gave Audience to Sir William Hus∣sey the English Ambassador; at which, lit∣tle passing besides Ceremony, no Judgment could be made of the Viziers Inclinations to a Peace, whose Thoughts were taken up with the Contrivances for the War; for the Turks being resolved to try the fortune of the following Campagne, would not much hearken to Proposals of Peace, espe∣cially being offered with an Uti Possidetis,The Grand Vizier no inclined to a Peace. that is, to make short work, That both Parties should be contented with what they had in Possession, and so an Amnesty to pass. What the Vizier had in his Mind, he was not willing to declare; but by the Sequel it appeared, that he resolved to Fight, and to adventure his own Life with the Fortune of the Ottoman Empire, on the hazard of a Battle, esteeming it more glorious to die in the Field, than poor∣ly and meanly in a private Chamber by a Cord applied to his Neck by the Hands of two Executioners: With these thoughts the Grand Vizier proceeded to Belgrade to Head the Army, which was full of Hope and Assurance of Victory, under the Au∣spicious Conduct of this Kuperlee, Son of Old Kuperlee, and Brother to that Prudent and Moderate Vizier, who subdued Candia, and put an end to the Venetian War,The Turks in hope of Victory un∣der this Grand Vi∣zier. which had lasted for 27 or 28 Years; for the Turks attribute more to the Fortune of a Man, and of his Family, and the Stars under which he is Born, than to his Wisdom, Conduct and Experience: And for this reason, the Turks so often change their Mi∣nisters, doing as Gamesters do with their Dice and Cards, throwing them away, in hopes by this Change, to change their For∣tune. In this manner, as we said, the Grand Vizier marching hastily away to the Fron∣tiers,The Eng∣lish Am∣bassador hastens to Constan∣tinople, the Business of the Mediation went not forwards, but this great Work being at a stand, Sir William Hussey proceeded to Constantinople, which hath for many Years been the usual place of Residence for the English Ambassadors. On the 18th of this Month of June, Sir William Hussey made a Solemn Entry into the City,And makes his Entry. being met on the way by at least 50 of the English Nation, all well and brave∣ly mounted on Horseback, with rich Furni∣ture and Cloathing. Moreover, to make this Solemnity the more splendid, the Hol∣land Ambassador the Heer Colliers, sent his two Brothers with the Officers of his Court, to make up the Train, and in this
manner the English Ambassador was con∣ducted in great Order and Triumph to his House at Pera. Much about the time, or perhaps the same Day that Sir William Hussey departed from Adrianople,The Death of Sultan Solyman. being the 12/22 of June, Sultan Solyman died at that place; the News of which being known and divulged every where to the People in the space of five Hours afterwards; the Mufti, Caimacham, Kadileskier, Nakib Effendi, and all the o∣ther great Men then present at Adrianople, assembled together, and without any delay proclaimed Sultan Achmet,Sultan Achmet, Brother of Solyman, proclaimed Emperor. Brother of the Deposed Mahomet, and Deceased Solyman, for Emperor of the Ottoman Empire; and having first set him on the Throne, and kissed the Hem of his Vest in token of O∣bedience, he was carried to St. Jub, as ac∣customary, on Horseback; where having his Sword girt to him by the Mufti, he was reconducted back to the Seraglio amidst the Throngs of People, who attended him through the Streets with Prayers, and loud Acclamations for his Prosperity and long Life: And solemn Prayers were publickly made in two several Moschs, which conti∣nued from Break of Day, until five a Clock in the Evening, all loudly praying for the Prosperous and Auspicious Inaugu∣ration of the new Sultan, and also for the Soul of the Deceased Solyman. Sultan Achmet being thus exalted to the Throne, the common People began to ex∣pect a change of Fortune, conceiving high∣er thoughts of this Prince, than they had done of the late Solyman, who merited no other Character than what we have already given him at the beginning of his Reign. The former was dull and heavy, studious, and given to Books, and much of the Be∣haviour of a Dervis;The Cha∣ractr of Sultan Achmet. but this present Ach∣met was more lively, free, and jocund in his Humour; he was both a Poet, and a Musician, made Verses, and sang them, plaid well upon the Cittern, and Colosseo, after the Persian manner. In his Jovial Humours he would some∣times make Visits to the Disconsolate Ma∣homet his Brother, singing and playing be∣fore him with his Instruments, bidding him be Merry, and telling him that he should not lament his Fortune. I have been (said he) a Prisoner for 40 Years, during which time you were Sultan, and did what you plea∣sed; now my time is come, and yours may return: And then he would take his Instru∣ments and play, and sing; saying, Brother you have let me live, and so shall you, and be mrry: And in this good Humour he would often pass his time, to the great comfort of his Deposed Brother. The Body of Solyman deceased, was em∣balmed, and brought to the Royal Mosch, built at Constantinople by Solyman the Mag∣nificent, and there Interred.Solyman interred. So soon as Sultan Achmet came to the Throne, and the Ceremonies, and Solem∣nities past, he immediately called the Mufti, and gave order to dispatch away with all expedition two Capugi-Bashees, the one to the Grand Vizier with a new Seal,The Grand Vizier con∣firmed. a Sci∣metar studded and set with Jewels, and a Coftan, or Vest lined with Sables, as an encouragement and evidence of his Confir∣mation in the Office of Prime Vizier: In this manner another Messenger was dis∣patched with the like Present to the Tartar Han, with Orders forthwith to march unto Belgrade, and join the Grand Vizier with his Forces, which having been divided into three Bodies, the Han could not supply the Vizier with more than 8000 Men for the present Campagne These Forces with several Asiatick Pa∣sha's,The strength of the Tur∣kish Army. amongst which there was a conside∣rable Body of Curds, or Gordi; and ano∣ther of 2000 Arabs passed over to the Vi∣zier's Army; with which, and with an Ar∣my of 12000 Albanians, the Turkish Army was so increased, that it was esteemed to amount unto 100000 Men; and in reality, and according to a moderate Computation, it did not amount unto less than 80000 good experienced, and disciplin'd Soldiers: Besides which 10000 Men were ordered for Great Waradin, under the Command of To∣pal Husaein, Pasha of Silistria, and Seraskier, for Reinforcement of that Garrison. In the mean time Tekeli being fallen un∣der the jealousie of the Port, he was for∣bidden to enter into Transylvania, where the People having a desire that the Son of Apafi should be placed over them, rather than Tekeli; the latter was commanded not far∣ther to meddle in the Affairs of Transylvania, but only in the Concernments of the Upper Hungary. At this time some Mutinies happened a∣mongst the Soldiers of the Turkish Army, upon Pretence and Demand of Donative due to the Militia at the Inauguration of e∣very new Sultan, which, according to an∣cient Custom, was six Dollars to every Soldier, besides the constant Pay; but this amounting unto a vast Sum, which was not at present to be found, the Soldiers were forced to content themselves with fair Words of being paid at the end of the Campagne, and at their return home; in which matter, that real Compliance might be made with the Soldiery, when time should come,Great Tax∣es on the Christi∣ans. the Christians were taxed over all the Empire at four Hungarian Ducats a Head; that is, Men of some Estate, and two Ducats for those of Inferiour Conditi∣on;

as also in like manner the Armenians and Jews were taxed;July. from which, it was believed, that a vast Sum of Money would arise. The Grand Vizier, that he might secure his Government the better, during his ab∣sence in the War, had before his departure caused several of the principal Governours in Asia to be strangled,Principal Men in A∣sia put to Death. and amongst them, a Seditious Mutinous Fellow, called Chara∣chehaia; who might have been the Author of Dangerous Commotions; howsoever there still remained a desperate Rebel in Asia, who with 1000 Men, roved over all the Countries of Sivas, or Sebaste; but that being a Country far distant from the Port, gave little care or apprehension of danger to the Vizier, or Grand Seignior. But that which administred most of fear at Home, was the Commotion of the Common Peo∣ple, caus'd by the Copper Money; which having been permitted to pass for Currant by the Government, was yet refused to be received in Payment by them; the which caused such Confusion in Trade, and espe∣cially in buying Provisions at the Markets,The Copper Money the cause of trouble. that there seemed a Dearth or Famine almost in the Countries; upon which many bold Complaints and Menaces were carried to the Caimacham, who was forced to give the People good Words, assuring them that Silver Money was Coining, and that the Copper Money,August. by Hattesheriff of the Grand Seignior, should be no longer Cur∣rant; the which for the present gave a stop to the Murmurings, and prevented a gene∣ral Insurrection; tho' the great scarcity of Corn, and all Provisions, both in Constanti∣nople, and Adrianople, made the People ve∣ry uneasie, and apt to break out into Muti∣nies. It is the Custom in the World, that when a Prince comes first unto the Throne, for the People to be inquisitive concerning his Humour, Temper, and Abilities for the weight of Government. The Character of this Sultan Achmet be∣ing now the common Discourse, he was re∣presented to be much more lively, brisk, and quicker of Apprehension than his Bro∣ther and Predecessour Sultan Solyman, who (as we have said) was as dull and as heavy as an Oxe; a weak, simple Man, more fit to be a Dervis than an Emperor;The Cha∣racter of Sultan Achmet. but this Achmet was said to delight to ride on Horse∣back, and to throw the Gerit, a Sport used by the Cavaliers, and mettled Sparks and Soldiers amongst the Turks. Farther, he was said to love Justice, and to be rigorous in the execution thereof; an Enemy to Ty∣ranny, and Oppressors of his People; but a great Admirer of the Fair Sex; which Qualities were thought very laudable, and for them, whether true, or false, he was had in high esteem with the People; and particularly because he was entered into the Project of Coyning Silver Money, and de∣basing the Copper to half the value of what it lately passed for in ordinary Pay∣ments. But the important Affair of all was the Success of a Battle, which the Grand Vizier resolved to adventure, both in confidence of the strength of his Army, and his nume∣rous Troops, which now were said to a∣mount unto 87226, Horse and Foot,The force of the Tur∣kish Army. as they were counted by faithful Persons, whom the Grand Vizier had appointed to tell them, as they passed the Bridges over the Save; besides 3000 Seamen, and some Spahees from Asia, which lagged behind, and the Rabble which attend Armies. This great Force,The French Ambassa∣dor per∣swades to a Battle. with the encourage∣ment which the French Ambassador gave the Grand Vizier to put the Dispute to the Decision of a Battle, promising him un∣doubted Victory, prevailed very much with the Vizier, who considering the Applicati∣ons which the English and Dutch Ambassa∣dors made for a Peace, was an Argument both to him and all the Turkish Officers, that the Emperor was in a dangerous condition, and unable to maintain the War: Howsoe∣ver when the French Ambassador was instil∣ing this Consideration into the Mind of the Chimacham at Adrianople, and that as his Master had already brought great Ruine and Destruction into the Dominions of the Emperor, so he would assist and support the Grand Seignior in his Wars both with Men and Money. To which the Caimacham made this Answer. That if it were true, what the Ambassador alledged, the Imperial∣ists could not be in such a condition as at pre∣sent to come down upon the Ottoman Armies, and be able to overmatch them both in Num∣bers and Valour: What diversion then (said he) hath he given to the Power of the Em∣peror? If he hath Wars with the English and Hollanders, what is that to us? We believe nothing but what we see, nor esteem of any thing, but what brings us immediate and ma∣nifest relief. Sir William Hussey the English Ambassa∣dor, as we have said,Sir Wil∣liam Hus∣sey at Constan∣tinople. being arrived at Con∣stantinople, was admitted three Days after∣wards to an Audience with the Caimacham, who received him with great State and Pomp, and in a Friendly manner demanded of him the Particulars of his long Journey, and assured him of the Protection of the Port, both for his own Person, and security of his Nation; after which, and that the usual Ceremonies were performed, the Am∣bassador and his Followers were vested with 22 Coftans, which was as many as at any
time were given to the French Ambassadors at other times, 18 or 19 were bestowed on the English; but now the Number was made equal, to show that the Esteem they made of the English Nation, was equal with that of the French. But how civil soever was the Behaviour of the Chimacham towards the English Am∣bassador, the Grand Vizier seemed to be of another Temper; for he not only neglected the Addresses of the English, but privately gave the French Ambassador to understand all that had passed between him and the English; and this Confidence between the Turks and the French was much increased at that time, by the arrival of a skilful En∣gineer from France, well practised in all Mi∣litary Exercises and Arts, relating to Mines, Sieges, Encampments, &c. and with him came 22 French Officers, who were all cloathed in good Green Cloth, after the Turkish Fashion; and with these, Monsieur Darmans a famous French Physician,The Friend∣ship be∣tween the Turks and French. was re∣commended by the French Ambassador to the Vizier, who took this Offer the most kindly of any thing; for as the Turks have very few Physicians of their own, they highly esteem those who come from the Parts of Christendom; so that the Grand Vizier took this Doctor with him, and kept him always near his own Person. August.The Ambassador, Sir William Hussey, ha∣ving continued some few Days at Constanti∣nople, to settle the Affairs of the Turkey-Company, and his own Domestick, and pri∣vate Concernments,Count Marsigli. Count Marsigli arrived from Vienna, bringing a Chiaus with him: This Marsigli had the Title of Secretary to Sir William Hussey, appointed by the Em∣peror to assist in the Matters of Peace, be∣ing a Person well practised in all the Trea∣ties relating to the Emperor and the Turks. The same Day that Marsigli arrived, both he, and Sir William Hussey had a Confe∣rence with the Dutch Ambassador, Heer Co∣lier; at which it was resolved to take a Journey to the Grand Vizier at Belgrade, and there again to press the Reasons and Arguments for a Peace. Accordingly the two Ambassadors depart∣ed from Constantinople the 11th of August, and entered into Adrianople the 16th of that Month, with intention to proceed to Bel∣grade in a few Days, had not the News of the total Defeat of the Turkish Army in a Battle given near Salankement, with the Death of the Grand Vizier, put a stop to their Journey for a while, until a new Vi∣zier should be created; the which was soon performed, for immediately one Ali Pasha, formerly Kahya of the deceased Vizier, and late Pasha of Scio,A new Vi∣zer made. was constituted in the Place of his Master; and he being com∣manded to proceed in 10 or 12 Days, the Ambassadors resolved to accompany him to Belgrade, there to attend his Motion, and those Overtures which might open a way to a Treaty. Now since this great Defeat given the Turks, in all appearance might cause an Al∣teration, and Change in the Affairs of Chri∣stendom, and be improved to a happy Agree∣ment between the Christians and the Turks; it is most necessary, and natural to this History, to give a succinct Relation there∣of. The greatest part of the Month of July,The March of the Christian Troops, to the place of Rendez∣vous. was spent in the Marches of the Armies to∣wards the Field of Battle: The Troops un∣der the Command of the Count de Souches, designing their Marches towards Esseck, they came to Pax, where they joyned with five Companies of Houchins, and five of Amenzaga's Regiments, and at Mohatz they were reinforced by 6000 Brandenburgers; about the middle of the Month of July, Prince Lewis arrived in the Camp, being welcomed with all the Cannon of Mohatz, and the same Day he took a View of all the Troops, at that Place, commanded by General Souches, and the next Day of the Brandenburgers; which having done, he sent Expresses to the Army which was be∣hind to hasten their March to Esseck; to which Place the Prince in Person riding Post, he arrived the 17th of July, where having been received in the same manner as at Mo∣hatz,Pr. Lewis views the Troops. he took a View of all the Fortificati∣ons of that Place, and of the several Regi∣ments which were encamped near thereun∣to: In the mean time the Cavalry of Count Souches, having passed the Drave, arrived in the Army, and were next Day followed by the Infantry of that Body; and the Day after that by the 6000 Brandenburgers: So that now the whole Imperial, and Branden∣burg Forces being joyned; Orders were sent to the General, Count Aversperg, to send down towards Segedin, all necessary Mate∣rials for Bombing the Places down the Ri∣ver; so that on the 20th of this Month, the Army decamped from the side of the River Drave, and marched as far as Bonce, where News being brought that part of the Turkish Army had passed the Save, a Lieut. Colonel was immediately detached with 150 Germans, and all the Rascian Foot, and commanded to Embark on Boats, and ha∣sten down the Stream to take their Station at Peter Waradin; and for farther Rein∣forcement of that Garrison, the Hungarian Heydukes of Illock, were commanded forth∣with to joyn this Officer at Peter Waradin; so as on all occasions to be in a readiness to oppose the Enemies Excursions into those Parts.
The great Army on the 20th joyned with the Regiment of Staremberg at Walkowar, which was esteemed the best in all the Ar∣my:The Forces joyn. On the 24th they came to Bachin, and there joyned with five Companies of Foot of the Regiment of Archinto, and with the Regiment of Horse of Bassompierre: On the 26th the Army encamped under Illock, and there rested that Day, when News was brought, That the Grand Vizier was arri∣ved at Belgrade, and having laid two Brid∣ges over the Save, he had begun to pass the River with his Army, which consisted of 100000 Men, extending it self from the Mountains on the side of the Danube, as far as to the Island of Zigan in the Save. Besides which numerous Army the Turks had a vast number of Ships and Gallies, 100 of which, under the Command of a Pasha, were sent to attack Titul, with which coming before the Place he immediately in∣vested it; the Town was commanded by Captain Thos, the Garrison of which con∣sisted only of 120 Germans, and 200 Rasci∣ans,Titul sur∣rendered to the Turks. and with them he defended the Place for three or four Days; but considering that for want of Ships, he could not be re∣lieved by Water, nor by Land, by reason of the vast Deluge of Rains which had filled all the Marshes, and made them unpassable for the intended Succours; Captain Thos ca∣pitulated on Conditions, that the Garrison should be safely conducted to the Army of Prince Lewis; but this Capitulation was not well observed by the Turks; for as the Garrison was marching out, the Lieutenant of the Pasha would not suffer the Rascians to pass,The Turks falsifie their Faith. ordering them all to be put to the Sword; but Captain Thos not allowing this piece of Treachery, and Breach of Faith, he came to high Words with the Pasha; up∣on which, the Pasha in a Fury drew his Sci∣metar; but Captain Thos being more ready than he,July. killed him with one of his Pistols, and with the other shot another Turk dead, who stood next to him: Hereupon the Quar∣rel growing high beyond all Reconciliation, or means of Agreement, Captain Thos cau∣sed his Men to fire upon the Turks, who were then 4000 Men strong; yet this hand∣ful of Men, armed with Despair, stoutly defended themselves, until being overpow∣red with Numbers, they were all put to the Sword, except some few who were made Prisoners, and six Rascians and one German, who made their Escape from this Bloody Action; the which howsoever cost the Turks dear, for they lost 500 of their Men, who were killed on the Place, and as many wounded. Peter Wa∣radin for∣tified.Prince Lewis continuing his March, ar∣rived the 29th of this Month at Peter Wa∣radin with the gross of his Army, at∣tended with all the Ships and Vessels, which carried the Provisions, Ammunition, and other Necessaries: This Place being very advantageous for its Situation, was ordered by Command of the Prince to be fortified; and here it was that a Regiment of Horse of the Duke of Newburg, and a Battalion of the Regiment of Huschin, with 19 Field-Pieces joyned the Army. On the 30th of this Month of July, a Rascian Peasant, or Country-fellow, was ta∣ken, sent by the Vizier for a Spy, to take a view of the Christian Camp; whom the Prince would not suffer to be punished; but returned him back to the Grand Vizier, to give him notice, that he was marching to∣wards him with his whole Army; the truth of which was verified soon after by the en∣suing Battle, which, as we shall see, was given on the 19/9 of the Month of Au∣gust. This interval of time,Preparati∣ons for a Battle. between the last of July, and the 19th of the following Month, was taken up in recruiting the Forces, and other Preparations for that great Day; so that on the beginning of this Month, 6000 Rascians, and 3000 Hungarians were added to the Army, under the Command of Ge∣neral Batthiani, besides 2000 Bavarian Foot commanded by Colonel Zacko; so that now the whole Imperial Army consisted of near 66070 Men; with which Body the Prince marched as far as Carlowitz, where the Army having rested some few Days, they marched to Salankement, and there en∣camped; and in the mean time the Turks blew up Titul, making their Escape by Wa∣ter to Belgrade. The Turks hearing of this Advance of the Christian Army, sent 4000 Spahee's under the Command of Kathana Pasha, to recog∣nize, or take a view of them in their March; but a Party of Hussars commanded by Raab, and Badiani being sent out against them, the Turks withdrawing, they retreated back to the Army, and with them a Christian, who ha∣ving been a Slave, made his Escape, and reported, That the whole Turkish Army had already passed the Save; so that the Prince resolving now to meet them, continued his March to Semblin, a Place near to Belgrade; between which two Places, nothing but the River intervenes. The Turks being much stronger in Ship∣ping than were the Christians, they were always passing up and down the River, so that all the Ships attending the Imperial Camp were forced to remain at Peter Wa∣radin; from whence,The Turks strong in Ships, hin∣der the Provisions of the Ar∣my. with great inconve∣nience, all Provisions and Ammunition were brought by Land to the Camp; until such time as General Dunewaldt being come to
the Army, had dispatched 300 Germans, and 200 Hungarians, back to Salankement, to cover and secure 300 of the Christian Ves∣sels, which were arrived at that place laden with Provisions; which was of great Re∣lief to the whole Army. The two Armies being now very near to each other, Parties were daily detached on both sides to make Discoveries, and bring Intelligence; one of which from Prince Lewis on the 8th of this Month,Skirmishes in Parties. had an Encounter with some advanced Guards of the Turks near Semblin, which upon appear∣ance of the Christians, immediately retreat∣ed; and a Fog covering the whole Turkish Camp on a sudden, that Party returned without being able to give other Informa∣tions. In like manner the Grand Vizier on the 10th of this Month, came in Person with all his Horse to take a view of the Christian Camp; upon which the whole Army was drawn out into Battalia; and some Volun∣teers, and other Troops, advanced so far on the Turks, that being attacked by great Numbers of them, they were repulsed, and droven back with some loss, until the left Wing of the Army (in which Prince Lewis was in Person) came in to their Suc∣cour; howsoever 20 of them were killed, and the rest were pursued to the very Camp; but in revenge the Turks were also beaten back, several of them being killed in their Retreat. The same Day the Imperial Army advan∣ced two Leagues farther towards Semblin, where they posted themselves in such a manner, that the Danube was on their Backs, and the left Wing guarded with Chevaux de Frize, which are a kind of Turn-pikes to keep off the Horse from breaking into the Foot. On the 12th the Army advanced in or∣der of Battle, within Cannon-shot of the Turks Retrenchments,The Ar∣mies near. near to Semblin; be∣ing attacked on all sides by many Hundreds of the Enemies Horse, which never stood any Ground, but retreated to their Camp, which was so posted on a rising Hill, or E∣minence, that the Generals judged it not to be attacked without great disadvan∣tage. On the 13th, whilst the Army rested, a certain Page to the Major of the Regiment of Piccolomini, who had been taken Priso∣ner formerly by the Turks, made his Escape, and informed Prince Lewis, that the Turks had certainly made an Attack on the Chri∣stian Army, had they not been disswaded by the French, who advised them not to lose the advantage of their Trenches, but to re∣main in them in expectation of being as∣saulted therein by the Enemy, or at least until they could draw out into a more ad∣vantageous Ground, or until the arrival of the Tartars, which were hourly expect∣ed. During this time the Officers and Soldi∣ers of the Imperial Army, kept themselves in a readiness to receive the Enemy; not stripping themselves of their Cloaths, for several Nights. That Evening it was concluded at a Council of War, not to engage the Enemy on that Ground, but to return back to Sa∣lankement, because that there being a neces∣sity to bring all the Provision from thence for the Army; the Convoys could not easi∣ly be defended from the Enemies Horse, which in great and strong Parties lay in con∣tinual wait for them: So that on the 14th in the Morning, by Break of Day,Pr. Lewis marches back to Sa∣lanke∣ment. the Trumpets and Drums were ordered to give warning to the Army to prepare for a March, the Baggage being sent before, and in the mean time, until nine a Clock in the Morning, the Army stood in view of the Enemy, who moved not out of their Tren∣ches, sending only a Party of Tekeli's Men to observe their motion. On the 15th the Army lay still, and so did the Turks; and the next Day Prince Lewis marched an Hour nearer towards Sa∣lankement: And on the 17th proceeding one Hour farther, the Turks imagined that this Motion was a Flight, little thinking that it was only in design to Encamp about Salan∣kement, where they remained near to their Ships laden with Provisions, and where they could choose the most advantageous Ground for a Battle. The Turks encouraged with this Imagination, marched after the Chri∣stian Army, and fell in the Rear of them with several Thousands of Horse; but Count Stirum General, and Count Hoffkir∣ken Major-General of the Horse,The Turks repulsed. charged them so briskly, bestowing some Shot a∣mongst them from their Field-Pieces, as caused them to retire with loss, and to re∣main more quiet for a while. Howsoever a∣bout Midnight a great Number of the Ene∣mies Horse, Camels, and Mules, having been stung by a sort of Venomous Fly, had broke their Halters and Bridles, and with their Sadles, and Harnesses,An Aarm given. came run∣ning into the Christian Camp, which gave an Alarm to the whole Army: But that be∣ing over, it was expected, that the next Day a Battle would ensue, which both the Imperial Officers, and Soldiers, did hearti∣ly desire. But the Grand Vizier following the Advice of the French, who were about him in great Numbers, would not adven∣ture that Day to attack the Army; but in∣stead thereof, that they might cut off all Communication between the Germans, and
Peter Waradin, they marched half a League beyond them, and there posted themselves with such haste and diligence, that in 24 Hours they had fortified their Camp with Regular Walls of a Man's heighth, and Bastions on which Cannon was planted, leaving only a narrow Passage for coming in, and going out from the Camp. The Ger∣mans in danger.By these means the Turks had almost cut off all Correspondence between the Impe∣rial Army, and Peter Waradin, and so hin∣dered the passage of all Provisions, that the Germans had infallibly perished in this un∣fortunate occasion, had not God Almighty visibly assisted them by His Omnipotent Hand. To this another Misfortune happened, the News whereof was brought by a French Deserter from the Turkish Camp; how that the Regiment of Dragoons of Count Buc∣quoy, Commanded by their Major, Count D' Arco in all 1000 brave and well mounted Men, together with 400 others, sent for Recruits to the Regiment of Caprara and Hoffkirchen, contrary to the Order of Prince Lewis, were fallen into the Hands of the Enemies;Count Buc∣quoy's Re∣giment cut to pieces. the occasion whereof was, that these Soldiers preferring the security of their Baggage before that of their Lives, resolved to take that with them; and so marching very slowly, they came to stop about two Hours in a Place, distant about a German League from the Imperial Army; where being attacked, and surrounded on all sides by the Turks, they defended them∣selves with much Bravery for the space of two Hours,The Chri∣stians lose all their Provisions. but at length they were all cut down, not above 30 escaping of the whole Number of 1400; the Major only was ta∣ken Prisoner, and the next Day after the Battle, was found Chained Hand and Foot in the Enemies Camp. Besides this the Turks took 250 Waggons carrying Provisions to the Imperial Army, with a 100 Ships belonging to the Sutlers of the Army; the Men whereof for the most part were saved, for joyning them∣selves with the Rabble of the Army, they fought stoutly for their Lives, killing great Numbers of the Turks. This great Loss was very sensible to the Christians, who having lost all their Provisi∣ons, without hopes of any other Supply, found no other Deliverance and Safety, but in their Arms, and so resolved on a Battle: The Turks on the other side growing Ar∣rogant, and bold on these Successes, began now to contemn their Enemies, and to look only on them as so many lost Men, whom they now condemned, and sentenced to Destruction, resolving to give them no Quarter in the Field. The Christian Soldiers thus armed with Despair, on the 19th of this Month of Au∣gust, by Break of Day in the Morning, ha∣ving put themselves into posture of Battle,19th, marched directly towards the Turks; and about Noon both Armies being drawn up, they faced each other at a small distance. The Prince of Baden Commanded the right, and Count Dunewaldt the left Wing. The Turkish Army consisted of about 100000 Men, of which 60000 were the best Soldiers in all the Ottoman Empire, besides 15000 of the best,The Dispo∣sition of the two A∣mies. and most experienced Janisaries; all which Force was advanta∣geously posted, having the Danube on their Back, and in their Front a deep Ditch, with Earth thrown up behind them; but their left Wing was not so well fortified, but that it lay something more exposed to the Christians, whose Army was likewise drawn up in a Martial Posture. The greatest part of their Infantry be∣ing divided into 20 Battalions; that is to say, The Regiment of Ernest Staremberg four Battalions, of Souches three, of Chiz∣zola one, of Guido Staremberg three, of Salm one, of Beck one, of Otting two, of Bran∣denburg three, of Caunitz one, of Vaude∣mont one; the which were flanked with the two Regiments of Horse of Nieuburg and Holstein, with the greatest part of the big∣gest Cannon: The rest of the Army was drawn up after the usual form of Battle in a right Line opposite to the Enemy; and in this Posture upon firing a Bomb, which was the Signal given, they all marched in an e∣qual Line, until they came within 200 Pa∣ces of the Enemy; and then the Cannon on each side began to play: At the first it was intended to attack the Enemies left Wing, before the right, to give room for the Foot,The Battle of Salan∣kement. which was placed on the rising of a Hill opposite to the main, and strongest Intrenchment of the Turks, which was for∣tified with 80 Pieces of Cannon; and also to charge the Enemies Horse, which were drawn up below the Hill in the Plains, with design that having Overthrown them, to force through the Camp, unto that part where the Enemies were less fortified and secured. It seems that the right Wing was something too forward, and began to en∣gage before the left could come up, being hindred by the high Grass and Bushes; howsoever here was no staying or retreating for the right Wing; but, on they went, looking on the Enemy before them, and proceeded to their very Ditches and In∣trenchments; but the Janisaries having a good Parapet, or Breast-work before them, fired so furiously from thence, that many both of the Chief, and Subaltern Officers were killed and wounded; and here it was that General Souches upon a numerous Sal∣ly
of the Enemy, was forced to give way, until the Foot came up, which was not far behind; but in the mean time being su∣stained by the four Regiments of Nieuburg, Holstein, St. Croix, and Darmstadt under the Command of the Dukes of Holstein and Aremberg, they advanced to the very brink of the Enemies Retrenchments, with which Example of Bravery both Horse and Foot, being again animated, the Infantry made several Attacks on the Enemy, and tho' they were sometimes repulsed, yet being relieved, and guided by those brave Offi∣cers both of Horse and Foot; the Fight was continued from three a Clock in the After∣noon, until it was Night, by which time all the Superiour Officers of the Infantry were killed, excepting only General Guido of Staremberg, and Prince Charles of Vaude∣mont, tho' both of them were also wound∣ed. Nor was the rest of the Army in the mean time idle; for the Enemy attacking them in the left Wing, and in the Flank with great fury, were as bravely repulsed by the Brigades of Castelli and Hoffkirchen; but the Turks rallying all their Horse into a Body, fell on with greater Fury, in despight of the small and great Shot, and charged the Brigade of General Sarau, which was part of the Right Wing: And the Turks being very numerous on that side, they so over-pow∣red this Brigade, that two of the Battali∣ons were cut down on the Ground where they stood, in which Action, the Battalions of Otting, Beck, and also the Old Regi∣ments of Staremberg, and Brandenburg, suf∣fered very much; so that until that time being about six a Clock, Fortune favoured the Turks; and things had such a dismal and desperate Face, that the Generals themselves began to despair of saving one Man from this Bloody Action;The Chri∣stians in a dangerous posture. for here was no Re∣treat, or Sanctuary, nor Place to fly unto for Succour: And thus both Officers and Soldiers armed with Despair, redoubled their Endeavours, and in contempt of Death rushed on the Enemies Squadrons; the which being observed by those who attend∣ed the Baggage, and remained for Reserves, how that their Companions were beset on all sides, and in a continual Fire, were a∣shamed to be Lookers on, and Spectators of this Tragedy, came in to the Succour of those who were ready to turn their Backs, and with their Cries and Prayers, gave a stop to their Flight. Matters standing in this desperate State and Condition, the main Body of the Ar∣my under the Command of the Branden∣burg Generals, Barsus and Brandt, came timely in to the Assistance of Count Sarau, who by these Succours rallied his Men, and defended his Post, until about an Hour be∣fore Night, when the Brigades of Hoffkir∣chen, and Castelli, with the left Wing, which at this time was Commanded by the Prince of Baden in Person, were advancing towards that side of the Turkish Army, which was not as yet Intrenched,The Chri∣stians en∣ter the E∣nemies Camp. and so furiously as∣saulted them, that by the Divine Assistance, and Arm of the God of Hosts, visibly ap∣pearing for them, they at last forced, and entred the Enemies Camp, driving them from the rising Grounds where they had planted their Cannon; which when the Hungarians and Rascians observed, they, who until then had been something back∣ward, and watched the time to Escape, came thundering down with renewed Courage, and furiously entered the Turkish Camp, cut∣ting down all that presented before them; by which means a Way was opened for the right Wing to advance; and so the Turks being brought into the middle, and attack∣ed on all sides in a narrow Ground between their Trenches and the Danube, were entire∣ly subdued, and overcome, and began to fly. And tho' the Turkish Cavalry for the most part found a way to escape, through a void Interval laid open for the right Wing, howsoever the Foot continued to defend themselves so furiously and firmly in their Trenches, that tho' the Field was yielded to the Christians, yet here they received their greatest loss; for this Action cost the Life of the Duke of Holstein, with a Deluge of Blood, entirely to subdue the already con∣quered Enemy. The Anger, Rage, and Despair of the Turks on one side, and the Fury of the Christians on the other, was such, that the first scorned to accept Quarter, and the o∣thers not willing to give it; for which rea∣son very few Prisoners were taken. The remainder of the Turkish Cavalry, amongst which was the Grand Vizier in Person, were forced to break their way through the narrow Passages, and Distances between the Lines, with their usual Cries of Allah, Allah, which is a calling upon the Name of God: In this Passage many of them fell, and many were mortally wound∣ed, so that the Roads, to the very Save, were filled with dead Bodies; and on the other side thereof, the Grand Vizier, with many other principal Turkish Officers, end∣ed their Days. In this memorable Battle, which was the most Bloody of any that hath happened in several Ages, the Turks lost in all upwards of 25000 Men, and amongst them the Grand Vizier; what Officers were killed on both sides, or wounded, appears in the following List. The Turkish Fleet, bringing their Ves∣sels close to the Shoar, and as near as they
could to their Army, landed 5000 Men out of it, which might have turned the Bal∣lance, had they come timely in unto the Assistance of their Brethren;The Turks land 5000 Men out of their Fleet. but finding the whole Army in Confusion, and all the Field in disorder, they retired with much Precipitation Aboard their Fleet. It would be impossible to describe all the Circumstances, Turns, Changes, Passages, and Chances of this Battle, which was fought on both sides with admirable Reso∣lution and Courage; for which those of the Christian Army who were slain, deserve for ever to be Chronicled in History; and those who survive, are worthy of a lasting Fame, and Immortal Glory. Much is owing by all Christendom to the Valour and Conduct of that Noble Gene∣ral Prince Lewis of Baden; as also to the Marshal-General Count of Dunewaldt, to Count Souches, General of the Artillery; to Count Stirum, General of the Horse; and to Lieutenant-General Barfus of the Brandenburg Troops, besides all the Ser∣geants, Generals, and Officers, who beha∣ved themselves with that Bravery, Con∣duct, and Zeal in the Cause of Christen∣dom, and of the Empire, that they merit to be mentioned with all Honour and Re∣spect, whensoever this Battle comes to be recounted in these present Days, or in fu∣ture Ages: And so bloody was this Battle, that the French King, to comfort the Turks, ordered his Ambassador to tell them, That such another Victory would ruine the Em∣peror. After the Battle the Imperialists became Masters of all the Enemies Artillery; namely, 154 Pieces of Cannon of all sorts, great and small, great Numbers of Ensigns and Colours; and amongst the rest of the Standard of the Grand Vizier, with those of the Pasha's, and of the whole Spoil and Plunder of the Field, with all the Camels, and Mules, and Beasts of Burden belong∣ing to the Camp, which amongst the Turks are vastly numerous: Also 10000 Tents, 10 Waggons laden with Copper Money, found in the Vizier's Tent; in the Treasurer's 54 Trunks of Copper, and 12 with Silver, and 24 Chests of Kaftans. Moreover all the Standards and Colours belonging to the Regiment of Bucquoy, ta∣ken the Day before by the Turks; 24 En∣signs, and four Horse-Tails were sent to Vienna, and amongst them the Grand Vi∣zier's Standard, which the Emperor sent to the Pope. The Loss the Turks have had in this Acti∣on, appears irreparable; for about 10 or 12000 of their best Disciplined, and Vete∣rane Janisaries being killed, they have not as yet been recovered to this very Year of 1694; the which is evident, for of all the Army they could make in that Year of Turks and Tartars, with Thousands of raw, and ill composed Troops, consisting of Plow-Men, and Cow-Boys, they could not make up an Army of 50000 Men; which indeed is wonderful, and shows the strange Catastrophies of this unstable World; and deserves our serious Contem∣plation of the Uncertainty of Humane Af∣fairs? For whereas the Ottoman Empire, which hath been famed in past Ages for Multitudes and Swarms of Men, by which, over-powering their Enemies by Num∣bers, rather than by Valour, made all their Conquest from Basora, as far as Buda, are now dwindled to a Condition, which many of our smaller Princes in Christendom are able to equal. All which we are to attribute to the Al∣mighty Hand of God, who commiserating the wretched Estate of Christendom, at a time when the Victorious Arms of France were employed in ruining and laying waste one end of it, the Turks had Invaded the other, and threatned an entire Desolation of all Germany.

QUesto Stendardo è del Gran Vesiro, che suole il Gran Signiore di Turchi man∣darlo al Gran Vesiro quando và alla Guerra, è deve esser nella Cima differente dall'altri. II. Questo Stendardo è d'un Serascher che doppo il Gran Vesiro suol esser constituito; que∣sto serve per direttore della Battaglia che stà alla sua mano destra, dove assiste anco l'Agha di Gianizzari.

And here I shall add this particular Pas∣sage. That the Count de la Tour, Vice-Chan∣cellor of Bohemia, assur'd Mr. Ash, now a Bishop in Ireland, That the Evening the Battle was fought at Salankement, Count Zerins, (who was a Young Man, and the last of the Family) his Lady walking in her Garden, with some other of her Friends, suddenly perceiv'd their great Hall illuminated as it was wont to be for Funerals; but upon search all disappear∣ed. The same Lady sitting down in an Ar∣bor where she us'd to sit with her Hus∣band, she felt one hastily sit down by her; at which being surprized, she sud∣denly started up, but found nothing. Soon after a Clap of Thunder and Light∣ning fell on the Ancient Tomb of the Zerins, broke into the Vault, and burnt up all the Bodies and Coffins that were there. The same Gentleman asserts, That the very Evening the Battle was fought, and as near as could be guess'd, the very Moment the Turks began to Fly, an Old Turkish Prisoner, kept in the Common Prison at Vienna, suddenly cry'd out with a great Passion, We are Ruin'd and Undone, &c. And being ask'd, What was the Reason of his Noise, he could give no other Account, but that he had an Impulse, which forc'd him to cry out in that manner.
MEMOIRS OF Sir WILLIAM HƲSSEY's Reception, and Negotiati∣ons at Belgrade, dated the 30th of April 1691. To Chan∣cellor Straatman. AMET Pass of Dierbekir, and Se∣raskier in these Parts of the Save, has desired me for the Com∣mon Good of the Poor Christians here∣abouts so much oppressed, to write to your Excellency, and interpose in their behalf the good Offices of His Majesty of Great-Britain, my Master; which I the more readily perform, as being pur∣suant to the Orders of my King (equal∣ly a Friend to both Empires) to con∣tribute all possible Means, and apply my best Endeavours to the removing the pernicious Effects of this so long and Bloody a War, and changing it into an ho∣nourable lasting Peace. Your Excellency may be sensible, that besides the Obligations of Christian Cha∣rity, 'tis my Interest also to correspond and cherish (by good Offices) that Con∣fidence and Esteem which they here ex∣press for the King my Master, and there∣fore I doubt not but your Excellency will comply herewith, as far as is in your Power, and likewise sollicit the Court for more ample and positive Orders, to which Charitable Work my Lord Pagett (His Majesty's Envoy Extraordinary at Vienna) will (I am sure) be earnestly assistant. I intreat your Excellency also to send this Original by a Staffettee to his Lord∣ship, that he may understand how well I have been received here, and give an Account thereof to the King my Ma∣ster. As soon as I entred into the States of the Ottoman Empire, I was met by the Beg, or Commandant of every Place, attended by the Militia, who furnished me with all Necessaries both for my Journey and Subsistence: At Peter Wa∣radin I was Complemented by an Aga, sent from the Seraskier; and at the Mouth of the Theysse, was met by many Barks, guarded by Janisaries, who con∣ducted me to Belgrade, where I was pre∣sently Complemented by the principal Officers of the Seraskier's Court, who sent his own Horses to convey me and my Family to the Tents, which were pitch'd on the Shoar, and appointed to receive me. The next Day I was received by the Seraskier in full Divan, composed of all the Principal Officers both Civil and Mi∣litary; where when I had given Thanks for the Honours received, the Passa an∣swered me, That such were the Ancient Customs of the Ottoman Empire, which they were resolved to observe, and abolish the Abuses introduced by the late Grand Seignior, and his Prime Vizier Mustapha. Then the Seraskier, with much earnest∣ness, did exaggerate the Unjust Oppressi∣on which was practised by Christians to those of the same Faith, who Inhabited the Country called Syrmium, situate be∣tween the Drave, Save, and Danube, who were barbarously spoil'd of their Cloaths, robb'd of their Cattle, and o∣bliged to pay excessive Impositions against all Laws of Humanity and a regulated Government; whereas on the contrary, their Sultan sent Money to be distributed among the Poor Subjects, to buy them Cattle and Seed, thereby shewing himself a Father of the Miserable, and not a Ty∣rant; and this Charity (continued he) which ought to be natural to you Christi∣ans towards one another, need not hinder the Hostility of Soldiers when they meet and encounter, leaving the poor Coun∣try-Men in Peace, who labour only for the Publick Good, and the Service of that Prince whom God shall place over them. I answered with applauding such Pious Maxims, and that I hoped so good Dispo∣sitions would incline them more favoura∣bly to hearken to what I was to propose in the Name of my King, towards the ending this Bloody War between the two Empires; and that as to the Particulars he mentioned, I being a Stranger knew nothing of them. He then proceeded to charge Count Chizzaola (Commandant of Esseck) to have deceived him on several Occasions after his Word given; a Crime (says he) which will be punished by God; and if the Charity of my Emperor to∣wards
the Poor Subjects and Country∣men had not restrained me, what wou'd have hindred me this Winter to have made Excursions even to Buda? But all I shou'd have gained, wou'd have been only the Tears and Curses of the Miserable: I an∣swer'd with commending the generous Clemency and Mercy of the present Go∣vernment; and our Conference ended with the usual Ceremonies of Coffee, Sherbet, and Perfumes. In the Afternoon I was call'd for by the Seraskier to a Private Audience, at which only his Effendi, and my Secretary (who was instead of an Interpreter) were pre∣sent: I represented to him, that this peril∣lous Journey I had undertaken, and by a way so unusual to Ambassadors from Eng∣land, was a Mark of the high Friendship and Affection which the King my Master bore to the two Empires of Germany and Turkey, who resenting sensibly the fatal Consequences of so long and bloody a War, commanded me to pass by Vienna, there to receive the Orders and Instructi∣ons of the Emperor of the Romans, towards the amicable ending of it, to which good Work shou'd not the Grand Sultan and His Ministers likewise correspond, it might be justly feared, that the Mischiefs and De∣solations hereafter ensuing, wou'd call down Vengeance from God upon the Mus∣selmen. The Seraskier applauding the King's Generous Design, took notice that there never yet was between England and the Ottoman Empire, either War or a∣ny alienation of Affection, but always perfect Friendship, which he beg'd God wou'd continue: He commended the Wisdom of the present Vizier, his Huma∣nity and Treatableness, and approved my Solicitous Earnestness to continue my Voyage, leaving it to my Choice, either to go by Land or Water. I told him, I resolved to go by Water as far as Rusgiuk, a Days Journey below Nicopolis, and to Travel thence by Land: He again re∣new'd the Complaints made in the Divan, in behalf of the Poor Inhabitants of Syr∣mium, and press'd me to Write to your Excellency to forbid the Plundering of Villages, and Excursions of the Heydukes, who behave themselves more like Thieves than Soldiers; and that your Excellency wou'd order, that they who are Peaceable and Disarm'd, may continue not only in Repose, but also be protected to the Be∣nefit of that Prince to whom God shall give the Government. He assured me fur∣ther, That whatsoever Expedient shall be proposed by the Imperialists, towards the preventing such Violences, he will readily agree to, and cause it to be rigorously ob∣served; and in this so Christian a Cause, intreated me to interpose the good Offices of my King. I do therefore beseech your Excellency to Correspond herein with A∣met Passa, either by Letter, or by Depu∣ties on both sides, to meet on the Con∣fines, and to be pleased to inform me of your Resolution herein, by an open Let∣ter sent to the Seraskier, with whom I al∣so leave a Copy of this, as I will like∣wise do with the Grand Vizier, not de∣signing to expose the Confidence they have in my King to the Hazards of any Acci∣dents which might prove equally prejudi∣cial to both Empires. I took this Opportunity to shew my self equally Charitable towards the Poor Christians taken in Orsoua, and made Slaves (as was reported) after they had Capitu∣lated to have safe Conduct into the Empe∣ror's Territories. I was answer'd, That they had Surrendred themselves with con∣dition, That if Belgrade were lost, they would be Prisoners of War, and that the Grand Vizier was not capable of violating the Publick Faith so shamefully. I de∣manded concerning some other Prisoners, recommended to me by their Friends; but was answer'd, That they were all the Grand Seignior's Captives, and without his express Order they could not treat ei∣ther for their Ransom or Exchange: He told me, That all Officers were well trea∣ted, and kept without Irons in a Chamber apart, with their Servants, at the Expence of the Grand Seignior. I left 100 Ducats of Gold to be distributed by Capt. Runkel, to the Poorest of them, which was all the Service I could do them, and of which I in∣treat your Excellency to give their Friends an Account. A Courier being dispatched to Constanti∣nople, I have had Permission to Write to the Grand Vizier, and Sir William Trum∣bal, giving Information of my Arrival; I purpose suddenly to continue my Voyage with full intention to do all the Service I can to both Empires, in execution of the Commands of my King, in whose Name I continue to press (as desired) your Excellency, that some Means may be found out to prevent the Rapines daily practised upon the Poor Country People. The inclosed short Letter for my Lord Pagett, I intreat your Excellency wou'd transmit to him, as also this Original, that his Lordship being sufficiently inform∣ed, may better know what to sollicite from the Emperor, and what to acquaint the King my Master. I am, Belgrade, April 30./May 10. 1691.
Sir William Hussey's Letters to the Lord Pagett at Vienna. Adrianople, May 25. 1691. My Lord, I Sent a full Account of our Arrival at Bel∣grade, April 30. S. N. From thence we came by Water to Rustick, two Days lower than Nicopolis, and thence in eight Days Land-Journey hither; whence we advanced forwards two Days, but met there by my Se∣cretary and Interpreter from Constantinople, with Letters and Advice from Sir William Trumbal, that the Vizier was upon departure, and ordered us to stay his Arrival at Adri∣anople. We returned back two Days past: I have been received and treated in all Places with singular marks of Respect and Honour, equal to any in the same Character. I send this upon Fortune to inform your Lordship of our Arrival. As to our Negotiation, I must attend the Audience before I can give you any Account, still in suspence. God be praised we are all well, and my Secretary I brought from Vienna. The Turks pretend to have a great Army, and design chiefly towards Transylvania. If this meets a quick conveyance, I beg your Lordship to acquaint my Lord Nottingham of my Arrival. I have wrote to the Dutch Ambassador for his Advice and Consideration, in respect to me, and his Stay, or Journey hi∣ther, since I cannot be permitted to attend him at Constantinople. How I shall proceed to Constantinople, stay here, or follow the Cam∣paign, your Lordship must expect hereafter. My Secretary has added a few Lines, I inclose to your Lordship. My humble Duty to all the Ministers. Nothing shall be wanting which is in my Power. I am, &c. Adrianople, June 3/13. 1691. My Lord, THE Vizier made his Entrance first, with no great Train, nor in the Pub∣lick Streets, but past direct to his Tents; half an Hours distance, the Grand Seignior enter'd, on the 29th, with a fair shew to us, but to o∣thers very short of former Splendour; he was in a Litter, one of his Court with him at the other end. The Vizier sent his Emeen Chewse, (the 2d in that Office) with eight more, the same Afternoon he entred, that he being in haste, desired me to be ready to come to Audi∣ence next Day. We were surprized, because our Druggermen in good Manners thinking that Day due to his Repose, did not design to have carried my Complement, and to desire leave of Audience till next Day; but I sent them immediately to perform my Duty in congratu∣lating his Excellency's Arrival, and to concert Matters for next Day, also to desire it might be private, in regard I was without Equipage suitable to a Publick Appearance. The Chewse Bassa told the Vizier, in regard I had no great Retinue, his Personal Attendance might be wav'd, but he commanded him to come in Per∣son: Accordingly on Monday Morning June 1/11 about nine a Clock, we set forward in the best Accoutrements we could: I was in my Em∣broider'd Scarlet Coat, six English Footmen in my English Lac'd Liveries, six in red Live∣ries al modo Turchesco, 18 Chewses in Van, two Druggermen after them, then my self with the Chewse-Bassa on my right Hand, and about 10 Gentlemen on Horseback following me, some of my own Company, others that came from Belgrade with me, and several other Turks, that we made a large Train, and drew Crouds of Spectators. In half an Hour we arrived at his Camp; conducted into his Tents, we past one very large one, and through that into a∣nother; his Officers were all drawn in Lines; they brought me a Stool to sit on, and imme∣diately the Vizier enter'd, sat down upon a Bed carpeted; his People made a Prayer at his En∣trance; he bid me welcome, and I acquainted him with my Commission, delivering him the King's Letter and its Translation; after this was over, the Tent full of Officers, and his two Sons standing on his right Hand, I ask'd his Excellencies leave now, or when he pleas'd, to speak in private; he told me, after Sherbet, Coffee, &c. the Turkish Treat, the Company should retire, and he being in haste desired it now, when we discoursed according to the Re∣lation I send inclosed Verbatim, as nigh as we four could remember, and to which we all put our Hands, viz. my self, Senior Marsigli, Mr. Coke Secretary, and Senior Antonio Perrone chief Interpreter; there remained none in the Room but the Vizier, as before men∣tioned, and one Druggerman more. At De∣parture I was Vested and 11 more, all that I had of Quality, and conducted back with some Respect. His Excellency was very courteous, and we had all the Marks possible of a very kind Reception, with as much Honour as any in the Character. My Lord, The Point resolved was, That his Excellency would not own the Turks at Vi∣enna under any Publick Character, would nei∣ther write to them, or send any other: When I told him the Emperor had accepted the King of England and States of Holland to assist, and was well disposed to a Peace, and if his Excellency did incline also, I hop'd there
might be a happy issue; he reply'd, He was for Peace, but upon Terms of Honour, and if I had Power to treat, would call for Pen. I reply'd, It could not be expected I should have full Authority before his Excellency's Mind had been known, and that Vienna was thought the properest Place, in regard there had been some Overtures already made, and Representa∣tives of all Parties present: That to arrive at an end, there must be a beginning; and that, if his Excellency permitted, I would send my Se∣cretary to Vienna, to perswade His Imperial Majesty to impower his General, that so his Ex∣cellency being now upon departure for the Con∣fines, they might treat there; and if his Ex∣cellency judged my Person and Presence neces∣sary to so bless'd a Work, I would wait upon his Excellency, and attend his Camp: He told me there was no occasion I should take so much trouble; but said, Send your Secretary to Vi∣enna, that the Emperor send a Person accor∣ding to custom, fully impowred to treat here, or else that we are as we are: And to this he added two or three Lines: To this there's no Reply. My Lord, I spoke several times that the Commission was to me and the Dutch Embassa∣dor equally; which I did, and now repeat to a∣void all Thoughts, because the Vizier when he spoke, said, Let the Emperor send his Com∣mission to me, not naming the Dutch, and to this no Reply: 'Tis not an Ambition I desire, nor shall I less communicate with the Dutch Embassador, whose Counsel I shall always de∣sire. My Lord, I am very glad I have the Op∣portunity of returning Count Marsigli, who will supply by Parole what I may omit, or what is not convenient for a Letter, and that your Lordship will transmit it to my Lord Nottingham: 'Tis absolutely necessary that the Emperor resolves that he adjusts the Points with the Allies, or treats without them, which the Turks would imbrace greedily; but since His Imperial Majesty will not relinquish them, nor they able to defend, but must disgorge, and be swallowed up if alone; 'tis I think ve∣ry reasonable that the Emperor requires them to positive and convenient Conditions. The Turks Nature is to do at once, and therefore considering well there must be a Power intru∣sted. I shall be very ready to give all the pos∣sible assistance I can, and if required, readily pass to the Camp, or Confines, for obtaining so pious a Work, grateful, and most heartily wish'd by the poor Subjects of both Empires; and I hope I shall have the better fortune for the many hearty Prayers and good Wishes I have gain'd on both sides. God Almighty prosper and direct you to compleat it. What you send to me, pray let be clear, to avoid Replies, and that Count Marsigli may be perfectly instruct∣ed, who knowing the posture and humour of Af∣fairs here, will, I hope, expedite their Coun∣sels, and resolve them. The Juncture seems very favourable, and the Allies, I believe, very pressing; this Opportunity lost, God knows the Consequences. Senior Marsigli will tell your Lordship some things I have charged to his Memory, and desire your Lordship to send to my Lord Nottingham. My haste and length of Letters will not permit me to use Cypher at present: I have presumed to write to His Imperial Majesty, and most of the Ministers, to acknowledge my Obligations and readiness in their Interests, which I humbly beg of your Lordship to deliver; and if the Bearer, who goes directly to your Lordship be present, he can supply all that is deficient. God Almighty prosper your good Offices. I am with all Re∣spect, My LORD, Your Lordship's Most Devoted Servant, William Hussey. In the last Month of July we left the two Ambassadors Sir William Hussey, and the Heer Collier at Adrianople, where having received the News of the total Defeat of the Turkish Army, with the Death of the Grand Vizier, a stop was given to their present Motion towards Belgrade, with intention to proceed with the New Vizier thither; and there to reassume the Mediation towards a Peace, for which the present Conjuncture seemed very seasonable. The New Vizier was called Ali Pasha,A New Vi∣zier Ali Pasha. had been Pasha of Scio, and Kahya, or De∣puty to Kupriogli, the Grand Vizier now slain in Battle: But whilst they were medi∣tating of these Matters, and preparing to accompany the New Vizier in 10 or 12 Days, as was given out, unto Belgrade;The Death of the Lord Ambassa∣dor Sir William Hussey. it pleased God, that the English Ambassa∣dor, Sir William Hussey, fell Sick, and Died the 14th of September after 13 Days of Sickness at Adrianople: He was a Per∣son much lamented by all for his excellent Qualities and Experience in the Affairs of Turkey, of which he had learned much at Aleppo, and there gained a good Estate; with which returning for England, he Mar∣ried the Daughter of that Worthy Person and Citizen, Sir John Buckworth; after whose Death he was chosen by the Levant Company, to be their Deputy-Governour, in the Place of Sir John Buckworth, his Fa∣ther-in-Law Deceased; in which Office ha∣ving acquitted himself for some Years with much Honour, he was afterwards sent by
King William and Queen Mary, to succeed Sir William Trumball in that Embassy: His Excellent Lady resolving to accompany him in all his Travels and Dangers, patiently bore, and sustained all the Fatigues and In∣conveniencies of a Journey over Land; which was never performed before by any other English Ambassador designed for Tur∣key; who were always Transported either in the Companies own Ships, or the King's Men of War, by Sea: But now things had changed their Face, and as it was dange∣rous, whilst the French were Masters of the Mediterranean Seas, to expose those rich Ships to the danger of the Enemy; so it was thought most convenient to hasten the Journey of the Ambassador by Land; and that taking the Imperial Court at Vienna in his way, he might there receive such In∣structions from the Emperor and his Allies, the King of Poland, and the State of Venice, as were most proper at that time in order to a Peace with the Sultan, of which King William of England, and the States of Hol∣land offered themselves, by their Ambassa∣dors, to be the Mediators: Upon this Oc∣casion Sir William Hussey, with his Lady, remained some Months at Vienna, before he could procure his Dispatches; and then the Winter coming on, when the Danube was frozen up, he departed not from Vien∣na, until the Spring, and arrived, as we have related before in the Month of June of this present Year. And whereas the Mediation of this Peace was of high Con∣cernment to all Europe, we shall here insert the Methods, Rules, and Instructions, which the Emperor and his Allies gave to the English Ambassador in this Mat∣ter. The first Paper given to Sir William Hussey at Vienna, was dated March 1691, and called, Informations for the English Am∣bassador, designed to be Mediator of the Peace at Constantinople, and which may serve to obviate the Objections which the Turks may make. Annotata ad informationem à Dominis Ablegatis Turcicis ulti∣mò exhibitam, pro informatione Excellentissimi Domini Legati An∣glici, ad Portam Ottomanicam proficiscentis. MISSIS omnibus iis, quae Negotii tractandi substantiam alterare non videntur, ad ea tantùm respondere visum fuit, quae praedictam substantiam tangunt, vel contra Legationis jura admissa praeten∣duntur à praefatis Portae Ottomanicae Do∣minis Ablegatis ad concludendam pacem huc Missis. Quorum in ordine primùm occurrir, quod Domini Ablegati Turcici in praeteri∣ta suà informatione de Colloquio inter Emi∣nentissimum Dominum Cardinalem à Kol∣lonitsch & illos in Coenobio PP. Augustini∣anorum extra urbem instituto, commemo∣rant, in quo parum refert an Dominus Car∣dinalis à Kollonitsch illos Ablegatos Tur∣cicos, an verò hi praefatum Dominum Cardinalem à Kollonitsch ad Colloquium illud invitaverint, in eo tamen substantia posita est, quod nunc asseverent Domini Ablegati Turcici propositionem quam se Domino Cardinali à Kollonitsch tùm fecisse fatentur, non ex mandato Portae, verùm pro∣priâ mentis occurrentiâ nunc demùm se fecisse profiteantur; etenim saepe saepius per literas interrogati, num super illa tra∣ctare sufficienter instructi sint? Non tan∣tùm se, adaequata Plenipotentia provisos constanter responsoriis suis affirmarunt, verùm etiam patefactam sibi diffidentiam Ministerii Caesarei super hac qualitate con∣ceptam saepius repetitam aegrè demum fer∣re coeperunt & quaestiuncularum inutilium nomine appellantes moram principali ne∣gotio per haec fieri questi sunt, quod si ab initio statim ejusmodi propositionem Do∣mino Cardinali factam non ex Portae man∣dato, sed suâ tantùm privatâ mente origi∣nem ducere professi fuissent, Ministerium Caesareum vel ejusmodi propositionem pla∣nè ab initio non recepisset, vel de modo legis timandae dictae propositionis dictis Dominis Ablegatis temperamentum ali∣quod idoneum suggessisset, quam circum∣stantiam cùm tacuissent & tacere perseve∣rassent Domini Ablegati Turcici, eam nunc demum professi, satis constat, unde mora, & illorum detentionis causa processerit, & cui consequenter imputanda sit, nam sae∣pius per literas interrogati, num puncta proposita Domino Cardinali à Kollonitsch & ipsis copialiter transmissa menti suae con∣formia essent? Affirmative responderunt, quamvis non super iis, quae Domino Car∣dinali à Kollonitsch proposita fuerunt, ali∣quis Tractationis motus à Caesareo Mini∣sterio ostensus, sed tùm demùm fides rei adhibita fuit, cum hanc ob causam ad se misso Secretario intimo Domino à Wer∣denburg puncta Domino Cardinali à Kol∣lonitsch proposita non tantum confirmas∣sent, verùm & Turcico idiomate exhibuis∣sent, & Latine ad calamum dictassent, tùm demùm animus his adjectus, & desuper
cum Dominis foederatis Serenissimo nimi∣rum Poloniae Rege, & Serenissima Repub∣lica Veneta communicari coepit: Quorum sensa, si priùs delata fuissent, prius etiam formaliter cum illis Dominis Ablegatis Turcicis ex parte Caesarei Ministerii, tra∣ctari coepisset, eo vel maxime fundamento, quod Domini Ablegati Turcici, postquam ipsis clarè scriptum fuisset, quod Sacra Cae∣sarea & Regia Majestas literis D. Foede∣ratorum suorum de eo monita fuerit, quod Ablegatus Chami Tartarorum ad Serenissi∣mum Regem Poloniae missus clare edixerit, Viennensibus Ablegatis Turcicis, mutato supremo Visirio nullam concludendae pacis Plenipotentiam superesse, ii responderint, non se à Supremo Visirio ad proponendam pacem, verùm ipsomet regnante Turca∣rum Imperatore huc missos, nec Plenipo∣tentiam suam à Supremo Visirio, sed ab ipsomet regnante Imperatore propria ma∣nu subscriptum attulisse & exhibuisse. Cui proinde vel fides adhibenda vel propositi∣ones ultimas ab iis exhibitas acceptandas non fuisse; cùm verò his propositis nulli tractantium partium conveniens videretur, culpam non subsecutae Pacis sponte vel levi de causa in se suscipere, placuit confidenti∣am in supra qualificatam Plenipotentiam Imperatoris Ottomanici potiùs ostendere, quàm leviter almum hoc negotium abrum∣pere; Communicatis igitur, ut dictum, exhibitae propositionis capitulis praefatis Serenissimis Confoederatis hactenus eorum sensa desuper expectata fuerunt, nulla ex eorum protracta dilatione in Caesareum Ministerium resultante culpâ protractae Pacis aut Tractatuum, cùm saepe saepius dictum & scriptum fuerit Dominis Ablega∣tis Turcicis, Sacram Caesaream Regiamque Majestatem sine Foederatorum suorum sa∣tisfactione almam pacem nec concludere velle noc posse, quare cùm saepius memo∣rati Serenissimi Foederati sensus suos super propositis ex propinquo ostendere coepis∣sent, huc Pottendorffium Domini Ablegati revocati fuerunt, quod verò nunc demùm se facultate tractandi carere profiteantur & exinde Tractationem Pacis prosequi non valeant, certè nullatenùs. Ministerio Caesa∣reo, verùm Dominis Ablegatis Turcicis ea, quae ab initio candide proferre debuissent, studio tacentibus imputandum venit. Quod porrò Domini Ablegati Turcici praetendant, propositiones pacis Domino Secretario à Werdenburg scripto editas & ad calamum dictatas ad conditionem ac∣ceptationis intra decem dierum spatium restrictas fuisse, provocatur ad literam ex∣hibitarum & dictatarum propositionum, ex qua, uti nihil de decem diebus dictum esse constat, ita nec hanc conditionem informa∣tioni suae nunc demùm adjectam subsistere constabit. Quod verò facie rerum mutata, ut malè praetendunt & priores conditiones Pacis & posterius oblatas evanuisse praetendant, ig∣noratur, quo fundamento hoc sustineri possit, eò quod factum infectum fieri ne∣queat, nec res in eum casum reciderit, ut Partes belligerantes Pacem petere sibi con∣veniens arbitrentur; vel nova & à priori∣bus & posterioribus conditionibus aliena deponendi belli vel reducendae Pacis ratio adinveniri & excogitari possit, cùm mate∣ria, ob quam seu bellum geritur, seu Pax placitis utrinque conditionibus reduci pos∣sit, ob sibi imaginatam rei mutatae faciem à Dominis Ablegatis Turcicis nec suapte naturâ variet, nec immutari possit. Alterum, quod priori in ordine succedit, est querela Dominorum Ablegatorum Tur∣cicorum, quod in longum hîc detineantur; verum enimverò & toti Orbi & ipsis con∣stat, traditis Recredentialibus eos non ani∣mo detinendi hinc Viennâ dimissos, & Co∣maromium versùs directos fuisse, ve∣rum enimverò cùm per propositionem, sc. De qua Sacrae Caesareae & Regiae Maje∣stati absenti, & tùm Augustae praecipuis Imperii Romani negotiis implicitae, ante fi∣nem Januarii, & jam tùm Dominis Ablega∣tis Turcicis Vienna profectis, constare potu∣it; Domino Cardinali à Kollonitsch factam novam suae retentionis causam praebuissent, nec, ut supra dictum, alterutri partium Tractantium se praecipiti abruptione Tra∣ctatuum ream Mundo constituere conve∣niret necessariò, ubi tum deprehendi po∣terant Domini Ablegati Turcici apud eos∣dem de subsistentia & qualitate Propositi∣onis factae inquirendum erat, hoc cùm for∣tè Comaromii acciderit, nullo praemedita∣tae retentionis animo, sed forte id factum sibi certo persuadeant, qui libere abivis∣sent, nisi materiam novis suis propositio∣nibus redintegrandi Tractatûs suppeditare conveniens arbitrati fuissent. Neque verò hac in re vel contra Legati∣onis jura, vel contra Portae Ottomanicae intentionem factum fuisse aliquid ex se∣quentibus constabit. Etenim quod prius membrum spectat, ita cum Caesareis Lega∣tis nunc Eminentissimo Domino Cardinale à Goess, Domino Reninger piè defuncto, ac ipsismet Dominis Hoffman, Comite Caprara, & Kunif tempore flagrantis belli prostantia exempla per Portam Ottomani∣cam observatum fuissee clarè demonstrant, quorum priores duo ex Portae Ottomani∣cae ditionibus huc ad Confinia cum ipso Magno Vizirio & Exercitu devecti, &
custodiis undequaque circumsepti, Cardi∣nalis à Goess serò dimissus, Reninger autem retentus, & post cladem ad S. Gotthardum acceptam ex abrupto Pacis componendae instrumentum fuit, Hoffman naturali mor∣te apud eos obiit, Comes à Caprara ad muros Viennae devectus, & bene custodi∣tus dimissus quidem fuit, sed Kuniz re∣tentus qui pari honore habitus repulsis ab Obsidione Turcis ultrò è Castris ad Urbem se recipiens prosiliit; alia sunt Legationum jura tempore Pacis, alia belli tempore, quorum differentia, ut per se nota est, ita longa deductione non eget, nec hac in parte Dominos Ablegatos Turcicos aliquid recipere, quod cum Ministris Caesareis ob∣servatum non fuisset, probare poterunt, qui magno honore habiti & largè alimen∣tati ultra centum millia florenorum aerario Caesareo absumpserunt, nullo sane alio, quam restrictae liberae conversationis, qua∣tenus tamen id jure Gentium & licitum & necessarium est, incommodo affecti. Intentionem Portae Ottomanicae quod attinet, quicquid Domini Ablegati Turcici dicant, & se morum ac legum Portae Otto∣manicae caeteris gnariores esse asserunt, in∣terpretesque literarum editarum se adstru∣ant, clarum tamen est, quod indubia inter∣pretatione non egeant, & literae à Primo Visirio ad Praesidem Consilij Bellici ultimo scriptae sic habent: Verùm enimverò si tem∣poris ac statûs ratio impedimento sit, atque Negotii perfectio nequaquam arrideat, hoc po∣sito ibi existentes Plenipotentiarij ne diutiùs commorentur sine causa, sed quàm citissime nullo interposito die salvo passu & plenâ incolumitate ad Excelsi Imperii ditionem traducantur. Ex quibus, ut satis constat, non pure, sed hoc supposito, quod Pacis negotium conficien∣dum non arrideat, revocatos fuisse, in a∣prico pariter est, quod propositione suâ denuo factâ discutiendis conditionibus pro∣positis novam occasionem suae detentionis Domini Ablegati Turcici proprio facto suppeditaverint, praecipuè cùm ut saepe dictum, Neutri belligerantium parti ex∣cussae Pacis fama conveniret, quam si de∣fectu Plenipotentiae porro tractare & con∣cludere non possint, certum est, quod cul∣pa non subsecutae Pacis non in Caesareum sed Portae Ottomanicae Ministerium vel ip∣sos Dominos Ablegatos redundet. Tertium, Quod duo priora subsequitur, est querela Dominorum Ablegatorum Tur∣cicorum ob negatos sibi cursores, ut aiunt, formata; verùm si res penitius introspicia∣tur, nunquam sibi aliquem Cursorem peti∣tum denegatum fuisse probare poterunt Domini Ablegati Turcici, etenim recorda∣buntur, quàm in Sessionibus habitis gra∣vissimis de causis, Ministri Caesarei eos adhortati fuerint, ut Cursorem cum diffi∣cultatibus in Tractatu Pacis obortis ad re∣cipiendas instructiones expedirent, quan∣toque constiterit eos ad hoc persuadere, quem ubi demum petierunt nullâ morâ in∣terpositâ obtinuerunt, obtinebuntque toties quoties illum clarè petere placuerit. Etsi verò etiam querantur, quod post propositiones posteriores super iis mentém Ministerii Ottomanici rescire & indagare per Cursorem illis non fuerit permissum, respondetur, tùm eos Cursorem non peti∣isse, sed hoc quidem, ut acceptatis condi∣tionibus & transactâ Pace alterutri illorum liberum foret ad Portam Ottomanicam Tractatus conclusos deferre, & liberum ra∣tificandi arbitrium Portae Ottomanicae re∣servatum expiscari; quanta verò distinctio inter Legatum sic proficiscentem & Curso∣rem simpliciter mitti petitum intersit, con∣stat ex rerum naturali differentia, praecipuè cùm res ad statum acceptatarum conditio∣num, & cum acceptatis mittendum alteru∣trum ex Legatis propter defectum intenti∣onis foederatorum eo usque pervenire non potuerit. Caeterum, quae de sua hinc inde Tran∣slatione & incompetenti eorum Tractatio∣ne D. Ablegati Turcici queruntur, non subsistere, ex supradictis cuilibet constabit, quam praetereà omnium pariter Regnanti∣um commune desiderium latere non potest, quo quisque à se missos debitè honorari cupit, & vel propterea ad se missis congru∣entia honorifica non negat, quo in passu Sa∣cram Caesaream & Regiam Majestatem Re∣ligiosissimam & esse & fuisse semper, omni∣um Principum Legati Ministri, qui ultrò citroque hactenus commeati sunt, attesta∣buntur; nec ipsi Domini Ablegati Turcici, sepositis, quibus jactari videntur, animi passionibus, inficiabuntur. Viennae, Martii, 1691.

ANNOTATIONES. I. PACEM hoc modo conclusam Able∣gati & Plenipotentiarii Turcici à Serenissimo & Potentissimo Imperatorē & Domino suo, ad formam hic mutuò placi∣tam ratihabitum iri seque infallibiliter prae∣stituros, ut solenne. Ratificationis Instru∣mentum intra spatium triginta dierum à die subscriptionis computandum, aut citiùs si fieri poterit, hic reciprocè recteque com∣mutetur, se obligent, dictae ratificationis adventum hic praestolantes. II. Pax ista, quamvis secundum propo∣sitas Conditiones conclusa, tùm demum ro∣bur Obligationis & debitae Observantiae vinculum accipiet & inducet, cùm in om∣nibus ac singulis, quae de locis evacuandis & tradendis, atque etiam de Confiniis per Deputatos ab utrinque Commissarios con∣stituendis secundùm praemissa stipulabuntur & acceptabuntur plenariè executioni de∣mandata fuerit: Qua in re ad acceleran∣dam Pacis executionem & publicationem sistendamque humani sanguinis effusionem placuit utrinque, ut designatis ad termi∣nos Dominiorum ponendos & exequen∣dam Pacem ab utrinque Commissariis spa∣tium bimestre praefigatur, cujus decursu Confinia, prout conventum fuerit, statu∣ant, evacuanda tradant, & Articulo Pacis juxta sibi commissa exequantur.

Quae annotatio Caeteris omnibus in Tra∣ctatu praeponenda & de illa bonâ fide, pri∣usquam caetera pertractentur, conveni∣endum erit, cùm sit conditio sine qua non. Now follow the Propositions which the Turkish Ambassadors gave to the Imperial Court; with the Emperor's Answers there∣unto; upon which a Peace might probably have been established, had it not been ob∣structed by Men of different Interests, who hoped to have benefited themselves by the War. DECLARATIO ABLEGATORUM Portae Ottomanicae, IN Negotio PACIS. In Nomine Domini. I. CUM, ut alma Pax inter utrumque Imperium reflorescat, ac Subditi u∣trinque quiete ac securitate fruantur, neces∣sum sit, ut manifestis limitibus Confinia dividantur, quibus omnia disturbia & in∣cursionum occasiones de medio tollantur, magni Fluvii Danubius atque Savus pro li∣mitibus ponantur. II. Proinde à Porta ferrea usque ad Savi
Ostium omnis cis Danubiana Ditio, item∣que ab Ostio Savi usque ad pristina Croa∣tiae Confinia cis Saviana Regio subjaceant Ottomanico Imperio restitutis Alba Graecâ, & aliis locis quaecunque in praedictis cis Danubium & Savum ditionibus Caesariis Praesidiis tenentur, ita ut à pristinis Croa∣tiae limitibus ad exitum Savi atque illinc ad usque inferiora in Regionibus cis Danu∣bium & Savum nulla remaneat Caesareae Majestati praetensio. III. Vice versa à Porta ferrea ad Ostium Savi, & ab Ostio Savi usque ad pristina Croatiae Confinia ultra Danubiana & ultra Savana Regiones cum restitutione Temes∣varini & aliorum locorum, quae in parti∣bus ultra Danubianis armis Ottomanicis tenentur, subsint potestati Caesareae Maje∣statis, & nulla fiat à fulgida Porta prae∣tensio. IV. Valachica atque Transylvanica ultrá Danubiana versus Hungaricas partes Con∣finia in pristino ante praesens bellum statu permaneant. V. Transylvania in pristinum ante prae∣sens bellum statum restituatur, annuum∣que suum tributum integrè fulgidae Portae solvat, & sub utriusque Imperii protectione antiquis suis privilegiis fruatur. VI. Confinia Croatiae maneant in eo statu, in quo fuerant ante praesens bel∣lum. VII. His Conditionibus vel suspensio armorum plurium aut paucorum annorum, vel etiam Pax perpetua ineatur. VIII. Ab utroque Imperio tales limites atque Coloni, atque sub talibus Generali∣bus & Officialibus, quorum fides ac disci∣plina probata sit, ad lubitum utriusque Imperatoris in Confiniis sibi subjectis col∣locentur, ita ut Pacem integerrime colant nullisque disturbiis aut excursionibus com∣munem tranquillitatem interturbent. IX. Quaecunque conditiones in anti∣quis sacris capitulationibus expressae usque ad praesens bellum observatae sunt, nec praedictis octo punctis adversantur, post-hac etiam colantur.
Responsio Caesarea. PROPOSITIO, quam Domini Ab∣legati Turcici nomine Imperii Otto∣manici offerunt, illa ipsa est, ad quam tra∣ctando de Conditionibus Pacis sensim per∣ventum fuisset, si Domini Ablegati Tur∣cici ad discussionem locorum, quam Caesa∣re: Commissarii ad hoc negotium Pacis consiciendum deputati saepius proposue∣runt, condescendissent, sed cùm illi eam constanter deprecarentur & aliter negotium Pacis confici non valeret, serò sed nec lega∣liter quidem ab initio Domini Ablegati Turcici ad hanc Propositionem devene∣runt, cujus velociori manifestatione, & ci∣tius vetus amicitia restabiliri & multo hu∣mano sanguini ob pacem dilatam hinc inde effuso parci potuisset, quod autem ad hanc propositionem ex parte Caesarea hactenus responsum non sit, eò factum est, quod Sacra Caesarea Regiaque Majestas non nisi ex Condicto cum foederatis ex Religione foederum, quae eidem cum ipsis interce∣dunt, responsum suum dare potuerit, quod ob longinquitatem locorum moram aliquot Mensium causavit: Igitur Ad I. & II. CUM, ut alma Pax inter utrumque Imperium reflorescat, ac Subditi u∣trinque quiete ac securitate fruantur, neces∣sum sit, ut manifestis limitibus Confinia dividantur, quibus omnia disturbia & in∣cursionum occasiones de medio tollantur, proinde trans Danubium finis & limes Cae∣sarcae jurisdictionis & Imperii sit Porta fer∣rea & Varadinum, Temesvarinum, Gyula, Jenova, aliaque omnia, quae in partibus
ultra Danubianis armis Ottomanicis te∣nentur, usque ad eandem Portam ferream inclusivè evacuentur & respectivè maneant Caesareae suae Regiaeque Majestati, nul∣lâ in iis partibus remanente Portae Otto∣manicae juris praetensione vel jurisdicti∣one. Ad III. E contrà omnis illa terrarum plaga cis Danubium & ultra Savum jacens maneat Portae Ottomanicae, ita, uti fuit ante hoc bellum addicta, nullâ Caesareae Regiaeque Majestati Jurisdictione iisdem in partibus remanente. Ad V. Transylvania Armis Caesareis occupata, & Avito jure quaesita maneat; porrò sub ejusdem Sacrae Caesareae Regiae∣que Majestatis protectione, nulla Portae Ottomanicae ibidem reservatâ Juris cujus∣cunque competentiâ. Ad VI. Croatiae Confinia ita decurrente fluvio Unnâ terminentur, ut quae terra∣rum spatio sinistrae manûs ripae adjacent, Caesareae Regiaeque Majestati addicta ma∣neant, quae verò dextrae manûs ripae ejus∣dem Fluvii alluuntur, Salva Ottomanicae Portae permanebunt: Sublatis in cujusque Imperii competenti Territorio partis alte∣rius jurisdictione & juris Exercitio. Ad VII. His Conditionibus fiant indu∣ciae ad triginta annos. Ad VIII. Placet. Ad IX. Quaecunque conditiones in anti∣quis Sacris Capitulationibus expressae usque praesens bellum observatae sunt, nec prae∣dictis punctis stipulatis, aut liberrimo cu∣jusque possidentium dominio & usui e∣jusdem adversantur, aut praejudicant, post-hac etiam colantur, cassatis & annullatis vicissim iis, quae supradictis repugnant.
Repetuntur praeterea, quae in responso Caesareo ad primam Ablegatorum Portae Ot∣tomanicae propositionem conditione secunda de libertate Confinia utrinque Obstructi∣one Fortalitiorum muniendi: Item in tertia de inhibendis ex utraque parte incursioni∣bus hostilibus, praesertim Tartarorum; & quarta de receptaculis Rebellibus aliisque ma∣lis hominibus non praebendis: In quinta, de libertate Commerciorum: In sexta, de mutua Captivorum absque lytro restitutione: In septima, de custodia Sanctissimi Se∣pulchri aliorumque Sanctorum locorum in Judaea circa Hierosolymam, Franciscanis & Christianis restituendâ, concedendaque peregrinis Christianis Romano-Catholicis ad∣eundi & redeundi facultate, neque ipsis Religionis Romano-Catholicae exercitio iis in partibus impediendo; praetereà in conditione octavâ, de constituenda certa norma Cu∣rialium in recipiendis, honorandis, tractandis, remunerandisque Ministris, ultro ci∣troque Commeantibus; sicuti & in Annotatione prima ejusdem responsi de Obligatione Ablegatorum Portae Ottomanicae ratificationes conclusi tractatûs intra spatium triginta dierum à die subscriptionis computandorum, hic reciprocè commutandi; itidem secun∣da de Pace hac non prius quam stipulata executioni plenè demandata fuerint, robur ha∣biturâ praefigendoque ad dictam executionem peragendam bimestri termino, & quartá de Tókelio proditore noxae tradendo, contenta sunt. Respublica Ragusea nullo à Porta Ottomanica tributo aut alia exactione posthac gra∣vetur, gaudeatque libertate Commerciorum terrâ marique. APPENDIX. NEGOTIUM circa Confoederatos cum sua Caesarea Majestate Princi∣pes remittitur dispositioni ejusdem si ve∣lit, aut à pacis Tractatibus excludat aut includat; si includere placebit, hoc item duplici ratione fieri posse videtur, sive in puncto separato terminis generalibus po∣natur, ut cùm inter utrumque Imperium Pax & amicitia renovara sit, Poloniae eti∣am Serenissimi Rex & Respublica inter terminum quadraginta sive quinquaginta dierum honestis conditionibus paciscan∣tur, vel expresse ac specifice item in sepa∣rato puncto declaretur, ut Confiniis resti∣tutis in statum, qui praecesserat bellum Obsidionis & Occupationis Kaminecii & Confusionem rerum, in iisdem confiniis paulò ante ipsum bellum, atque Constitu∣tis in illo ordine, in quo erant, quando ante dissidia illius belli firma amicitia & bona vicinitas inter fulgidam Portam & Polonos intercedebat, alma Pax inter ful∣gidam Portam & Poloniarum Serenissi∣mum Regem & Rempublicam coalescat; Quoad DD. Venetos verò pariter hoc spe∣cificari potest, quod retentis occupatis Pacem cum fulgida Porta ineant. Ad APPENDICEM. INHAERET porrò Caesarea Regiaque Majestas iteratis suis declarationibus circa inclusionem suorum Dominorum Foederatorum in hisce Pacis Tractatibus, nec sine iis Pacem ullo pacto aut modo concludet, prouti etiam ea, quae in ulti∣ma Dominorum Ablegatorum Portae Ot∣tomanicae declaratione contenta sunt, iis∣dem communicavit, è quorum responsis subsecuturis aequanimem eorum declarati∣onem Domini Ablegati Turcici fusius per∣cipient. Demum Caesarea sua Regiaque Maje∣stas ultrà dictos suos Dominos Foederatos etiam Dominos Czaros Muscoviae cum eorundem Dominiis, jure amicitiae, ita in praesenti pacificatione comprehendit, ut ipsis intra annum à dato hujus Tractatûs cum Porta Ottomanica conclusi eidem ac∣cedere, ejusque participes fieri liberum sit.
The Turkish Ambassador's Com∣plaints and Expostulations a∣bout their Imprisonment. Ottomanicae Portae Ablegatorum pro Informatione Aulae Caesareae Domino Werdenburgio facta De∣claratio. SIVE ex literis Dominorum Caesare∣orum Ministrorum Nobis tùm in Su∣burbio Commaromii morantibus, tùm Pottendorffium ingressis traditis, sive ali∣qua ex parte ex discursu Dominationis Tuae ita conjicimus, cum Dominis Caesa∣reis Ministris Tractatus cum fulgida Por∣ta reassumendi quaedam inclinatio oborta sit, ut à speciosa & honesta ratione exor∣dium ducatur quibusdam tanquam motivis fuisse persuasos. Verum enim verò, cùm rem planè cognitam à Nobis aliter se ha∣bere deprehendamus, sinceritatis, quam erga utrumque Imperium profitemur, in∣teresse duximus, ut solidè declaratis in∣dubiis, quae ad praeassumptas suppositiones pertinent, circumstantiis, illisque penitus à DD. Ministris perceptis, nec sibi, nec Nobis negotium facessat obscuritas. Etsi autem ex ista nostra expositione aliqua displicentia suboriri posse suspiciatur, nos tamen coram DEO testamur, ex mera integritate illam promanasse & sanè si pe∣nitius introspiciatur, Candorem nostrum laudatum iri speratur. Primum itaque quo praetitulatos Mini∣stros ductos fuisse cogitamus id esse vide∣tur, quod quae in colloquio cum Domino Cardinali ante discessum nostrum Viennâ dicta sunt, ea in longam Negotiationem protrahantur, & ingens pro lubitu moles superstruitur, atque variae deductiones & Consequentiae subnectuntur; status au∣tem genuinus & exitus illius rei ita se ha∣bet: A nobis equidem nemo ad Collo∣quium invitatus est, ipsi Domino Cardi∣nali Nobiscum colloqui placuit & sese ex∣hibuit, ac tanquam à Caesarea Majestate instructus facultate cùm in Congressu Au∣gustiniani Monasterii Pacis restituendae rationem aliquam semetipsum indagabun∣dum praebuisset, à Nobis quoque etiamsi praeter ante declaratam in Solemnibus Confessibus rationem, nulla ulterius ex∣pressê à fulgida Porta fuerit insinuata, menti tamen Nostrae observata & pro re∣rum tunc temporis coincidentia visa pos∣sibilis altera quoque forma ad rem com∣ponendam proposita fuit, utrinque verò tunc declarata fieri non posse utroque No∣stri perseveranter asserente, & alterutro allatas Propositiones abnuente in ea ipsa sessione & Colloquium & disputatio solu∣ta fuêre & sic Viennâ discessimus, verùm cùm intentionem aliam subesse appareret & in Suburbium Commaromii transvectos Deputati ad Nos usque ad Confinia comi∣tandos Ministri in aprico deserentes clam sese subtraxerint, de detinendis Nobis Commissio liquidius innotuit, quod literae quoque & emissi subinde variis Occasioni∣bus venientes confirmarunt, quibus nem∣pe per Commendationem Pacis ad paci∣scendum adhortabantur: Cùm igitur Na∣ves, quibus devehi debebamus, nequa∣quam appellerent, & detentio Nostra in propatulo esset, nihilominus ad Omnia connivere coepimus & quascunque semitas, sive illegales, sive legales, digressi ac diva∣gati sumus, & in remotissima quoque al∣mi Tractatûs specie multum fiduciae po∣nentes, nihil omisimus, quod sinceritatem & candorem Nostrum explicare posset, atque cum superveniente Domino Wer∣denburgio conserto sermone Nostrae men∣ti oborta quaedam pro pace punctorum juxta rerum tunc temporis coincidentiam forma eidem exposita fuit, nempe hisce sub conditionibus, ut acceptationis à Cae∣sarea Aula Responsio intra decem Dies redderetur, alterque Nostri ad fulgidam Portam dimissus ei acta referret, Portae autem liberum relinqueretur ratificationis arbitrium. His ita projectis, Communicationis cum Confoederatis, seu praetextu, seu causa, semel iterumque ab Aula Caesarea bini Menses interjecti fuere, ast nobis nequa∣quam permissum, ut remisso Cursore fulgida Porta certior fieret, itaque Nobis voluntas aliqua suboluit ex punctis haud acceptatis captandae ex industria dilatio∣nis: Interea verò DEO ita volente mu∣tatâ rerum facie Occasio etiam effluxit; & Propositiones tam priores in Consessi∣bus pronunciatae, quàm Dominationi Tuae posterius insinuatae penitus inva∣nuêre, ut plane nihil Nobis reliquum & integrum sit, quod in medium afferatur; Septimus jam labitur Mensis, à quo ite∣ratis literis Caesareae Aulae significatum es∣se candide voluimus, nullum hic Nobis superesse Negotium & pro continuando ad Portam itinere multiplices supplicati∣ones porrectae sunt, preces tamen nostrae nequaquam exauditae fuêre: Certè in ni∣hilum dilapsae Propositiones istius Nostrae hucusque detentionis in causa esse minimè posse videntur: Coelorum ne Motus de∣siit? An ab illorum Opifice constituta re∣volutio
Orbis cessavit? Ut rerum Univer∣sitas eidem Cardini defixa desistat. Prae∣terea à moderno Supremo Vizirio Domi∣no Nostro nullas ad nos vel ex duabus Syl∣labis literas pervenisse & Nostrae custodiae causâ omninò reali rerum notitiâ nos carere, praeterito etiam anno contestati, & post-hac nulla Nos aliquid dicendi audacia pol∣lere, ingenuè fassi fueramus; ab illo verò tempore, cùm jam fermè annuum tempus clabitur, praedictis duabus de causis, mul∣to minus aliquod verbulum Nobis suppe∣tit, quinimò etsi Nostram Cognitionem nullius rei notitia tetigit, tamen quod à celeberrimi Crimensis Chani Ablegato in Polonia de Nobis prolatum est, ab ipsis Dominis Ministris fuerat Nobis significa∣tum, quid plura? Sicuti custoditi sumus, ita à tribus annis rerum omnium & Casu∣um notitiâ sumus orbati, quae uti sincere relata si ab Aula Caesarea pensitentur, ve∣ritati omnino congruere deprehenden∣tur. Aula Caesarea alio quoque duci motivo videtur, quòd nimirum erga Caesareos Mi∣nistros eâdem normâ tractationis Ottoma∣nica Porta usa sit, & pro lubitu suo juxta rerum exigentium, illos circumduxisse fe∣ratur, per DEUM testamur, versus Ger∣manos Ministros nunquam talem quam∣piam formam admissam fuisse, vetera fa∣cessant, sub initio praesentis belli à Caesa∣rea Majestate ad tractandam pacem duo Internuncii missi fulgidam adiêre Portam, quorum alteri Baro Hoffmannus, alteri Comes Caprara nomen erat, uterque sive Adrianopoli sive Constantinopoli cum Im∣peratoria Aula commorati sunt, & in trans∣migratione Regiae aulae penes simul iter & stativa habuere; Baro Hoffmanus Adri∣anopoli Constantinopolim Comes autem Caprara Constantinopoli Adrianopolim proprio instinctu & postulatu unà cum Porta profecti, famulitii sui partem Mari, partem terrâ transmisere, nemo verò eun∣tibus obstitit, in Urbibus autem plures Domos habitantes ad placitum circumva∣gati sunt & cum aliarum Gentium Legatis conversati, & omni libertate usi recreaban∣tur, omnimodâque rerum notitiâ informa∣bantur, servitio etiam eorum destinati Vi∣ziriani Aga & Regii Chausii & Janizarii placitis illorum nequaquam reniti jussi ad amussim illos coluerunt, atque obsecundati sunt, consueto etiam salario exacte & ex Consueto praestito, nemo à tergo prospi∣ciebat, & Comes Caprara tandem cum re∣vocatus fuisset, illico dimissus & post bre∣vem Budae moram quo intereà tempore Exercitus pergebant, sanus atque incolu∣mis ad Caesarea Confinia traductus est, Caesareus autem Residens in Porta quâ affluentiâ in Imperatoriis Castris vixerit, quâve libertate famulitium ejus circumie∣rit toto Orbe cognitum compertumque habetur. Ecquis ex Ministris Caesareis receptus responsoriis literis ad integrum annum detentus fuit? Aut solutis tractatibus nul∣lum ulteriùs expetens aut expectans re∣sponsum è via retractus est? Aut custodiae & detentionis tot loca commutavit? Aut à Servis Portae enormibus verbis fuit com∣pellatus & obtrectatus? Ottomanica Por∣ta modone promicavit? An non Caesarei Legati illam frequentarunt? Annon ultro subsistentiam ibi suam protexêre, & alte∣ro mortuo nonne alter subsecutus est, uti Caesareae Aulae prout placuit, & ei è re fuit, ita ex suomet instinctu agebat, quibus au∣tem rebus Porta nequaquam assuevit, qui ad eas invita compellitur? Negotia non asperitate, sed reciproca moderatione & mutuâ satisfactione ad optatum finem de∣ducuntur, adstitêre ne aliquando Residen∣tes Ottomanici Caesareae Aulae, aut Lega∣ti ad plures annos detentíne unquam fu∣êre? Nunquam à Veteri sibi calcata semi∣ta deflecti Portam fieri poterit, ut nova in praesens norma instituatur; Esto nobis∣cum cùm in potestate aliena simus, ita sit actum, tamen Portae incumbit suam ser∣vare consuetudinem, & ab ea ne latum unguem discedet, id tantum fiet, ut No∣bis supervacanea afflictio, cum Porta verò acerbitas inimicitiae magis augescat: Id etiam motivum, quod Aulae Caesareae sug∣gestum est, videant DD. Ministri, cujus∣nam vigoris sit. Ultimum tamen, quod DD. Ministris insinuatum esse videtur, tale quidpiam videtur, quod cùm nos fulgida Porta ite∣rum atque iterum identidem non revoca∣verit conjicitur, malle nostram hîc moram quam reditum, ast verò haec etiam aliter se habet & super ista relatione quaecunque construitur moles labascit, Nos planè Por∣tae mentem scimus, ejusque explicatio & elucidatio ad Nos attinet; quisque sui Im∣perii mores bene callet, rerum scientia & multiplici cognitione imbuto animo praedi∣tus modernus Imperii possessor Supremus Vizirius amplissimus Dominus Noster ab hac delegatione multum abhorrebat, propter aliquorum annorum in bellicis ex∣peditionibus prosperitatem qualiter excipi∣endam fore praevidebat ac praedicebat, cùm verò posteà ipsemet supremam admi∣nistrationem adornandam susceperit, vide∣tur experimento comprobatae sententiae constantius inhaesisse, atque aptioribus & magis appositis rationibus Reipublicae re∣gimen aggressus esse, ac disposuisse, pro∣inde
Imperii vires noscens & à pueritia cum domi suae, quae plurium Primorum Viziriorum nidus extitit, praxin geren∣darum rerum publicarum adeptus, qui∣bus mediis Bellum & Pax agatur, populus Ottomanicus precatur, ut DEUS im∣posterum etiam opem suam sociam illi ad∣jungat. Haec itaque est causa, quod neutiquam ad nos respexerit, verùm si ulterius inter∣rogabitur, & cur expresse non revocaverit, istius etiam dubii solutio clara est, cùm in literis Imperialibus ad Caesaream Majesta∣tem Scriptum fuerit, ut quam citissimere∣mittamur, & pro eodem reditu Nostro in prioribus & posterioribus ante supremam Imperii administrationem functi Primi Vizirii literis inculcatum sit, Imperiali∣bus ne literis aliquis respectus adhibitus? An Vizirianis literis assensus praestitus? Legationi isti aestimatio tributa? An al∣mae Pacis merito aliquod temperamentum allatum fuit? An non spatio fermè trium annorum Unici tantùm Cursoris Expedi∣tio concessa est? Et ipsemet diuturnam passus detentionem ab itinere reprehensus fuit; Cùm ita revera res ista se habeat, qui Nos principales Nostri sive per lite∣ras sive per expressos invisitant? An ve∣rò Nobiscum affligendum aliquem emit∣tant? Testamur sincere misertos infimi cujusque nullum ex suo famulitio ad nos misisse: Certè si ex Nobis liquidum & candidum responsum expetatur, id est, si hic ad decennium ita detinebimur, nemo ad Nos accedet, haeccine quae pronuncia∣mus, plane verissima sunt, quaesumus ne his vocibus quispiam offendatur, ut ex∣pressi ultrò citroque permeent, veterem inter Gentes consuetudinem reciprocè li∣teras Commeatus observari religiosè, cui∣cunque liberam permitti voluntatem, fon∣tem, qui à DEO ad extinguendum belli ignem erectus est, apertum esse necessum est; quousque verò his in despectu habitis Nos in isto eodem statu perseveramus, sa∣nè nihil ad bonum commune peragetur, sin verò in Aula Caesarea ambigitur, an Nostram hîc moram fulgida Porta velit, dimissio Nostra posthac fulgidae Portae dis∣positioni remittatur & Cursoris in Portam, expeditio nobis concedatur: Favente DEO Potentissimi Imperatoris Nostri quidcunque in animo est, nobis revela∣bitur; speramus tamen sidem adhibendam esse nostrae contestationi, ita ut iteratis In∣terrogationibus non opus sit, ac proinde nos neutiquam detinendos, & si quid prae∣terea tempori praesenti consentaneum & Imperii Ottomanici Magnitudini conso∣num proponendum videbitur, si placet, eo quoque pronunciato, Nos quampri∣mùm esse remittendos: Fortè postquam nos salvi & incolumes & contenti redieri∣mus, almus aliquis aditus aperietur, & utrinque permanentibus Ministris oppor∣tuno momento ac loco ex mutua propen∣sione & satisfactione, si ita Divinae Maje∣stati placuerit, sacrosanctus Pacis Tracta∣tus coalescat, ex vi certè nullum emolu∣mentum emanabit, haec ex sinceritate & integritate Nostri erga utrumque Imperi∣um promanant, testis est DEUS, nullam subesse hypocrism, haeccine juxta inter Germanum & Ottomanicum Imperium intercedentes res in quonam statu reperi∣antur facile ab Aula Caesarea de prehende∣tur, ne se incassum defatiget. The English Ambassador being Dead, an end was put to the Treaty, and all thoughts of Peace were laid aside, on one side and the other;Treaties of Peace are laid aside. for after the Battle of Salanke∣ment the Circumstances of things were changed, and there was a necessity of con∣sulting again the Emperor and his Allies, before any farther Measures could be ta∣ken on the former Instructions. In like manner the Turks were in great Confusion and Distraction, not knowing which way to turn themselves; sometimes it was thought necessary, that the Grand Vizier should hasten to Belgrade to take the Care and Command of the scattered Troops, which were now at a loss for want of a Chief Head, and a Place whereunto to resort, and take refuge: Besides the Presence of a Vi∣zier was esteemed of great encouragement to the broken Army, and the only means to retard the Flight of those who were rea∣dy to break up their Camp, and betake themselves to their own Habitations. Whilst the Vizier was consulting hereof News came that the Army at Belgrade was all, or for the most part dispersed; that the small Number of the Janisaries which sur∣vived,The Army at Bel∣grade dis∣persed. were resolved not to remain longer at Belgrade, but were already on their March towards Adrianople, in a Naked and Poor Condition, without Money, or Cloaths. In like manner it was reported, That the Spahees, who lately went to the War with a good Epuipage, and well Mounted on Horse-back, were now returning back on Foot, miserably Despoiled, and Poor, with∣out Money, Horse, or Arms: Many of them who had Escaped with their Horses and Arms, were passing the Dardanelli into Asia, and thence travelling into their own Countries, perhaps as far as Ico∣nium, Aleppo, Damascus, or some other more remote Countries; other Spahees, who had neither Horses, or Arms, were marching towards Adrianople, there
to demand the Donative, which hath al∣ways been given by a New Sultan at his first Inauguration:The Misery of the Turkish Army. This Pretension of the Soldiery, which amounted unto more than a Million, stroke great Terrour into the Minds of the Chief Officers; for the Ex∣chequer being wholly empty, and the Sol∣diery in the utmost Extremity, and armed with Rage and Despair, no Man knew what these Miseries might produce; and the Soldiers approaching every Day nearer and nearer, all People were affected with the same Consternation, as if the Germans, and the worst of Enemies had been at their Gates. In few Days after, the Aga of the Jani∣saries, with the small remainder of his Ja∣nisaries arriving at Adrianople, caused the Grand Vizier, the Mufti, Kadileschers, (who are the Lords Chief Justices) toge∣ther with the Prime Officers of the several Ogiacks to be convened,A Consul∣tation held at Adri∣anople. and amongst them∣selves they held a long Conference. At which they concluded upon several Particulars. First, It was resolved to Confirm, and Maintain Sultan Achmet upon the Throne; it being esteemed a thing unworthy of the Grandeur, and Wisdom of the Sublime Port to change so suddenly, and frequently, the Person of their Sultans. Secondly, It was resolved, That the Grand Seignior should Winter that Year at Adrianople. Thirdly, That the Mint should diligent∣ly Work Day and Night, to make Silver Money for Payment of the Soldiery. And Lastly, It was resolved, that (cost what it would) Great Waradin was to be Succoured and Relieved. The which Resolutions, especially that about Coyning Money for Payment of the Soldiery, gave a stop to their Mutinies, and Insurrections, which were daily fear∣ed: But what more sensibly consummated all the Miseries of the Turks, was the want of Bread,The Mise∣ries amongst the Turks. as well as of Money; there ha∣ving never been known in those Countries so great a Dearth of Bread, as also of all sorts of other Provisions, as at that time, which joyned to all these Misfortunes, far∣ther News was brought, That there had been another Grievous Earthquake at Smyrna: And that an Express was come out of Asia, That all that Country was over-run, with Robbers, and Murderers, who were assembled in a Body near Sebaste, the Ancient Nest, and Nursery of Rebel∣lion. In the mean time the French Ambassador laboured by all means possible, to give Heart, and Courage to the Turks,Novemb. The French Ambassa∣dor encou∣rages the Turks. to con∣tinue the War; assuring them, That his King would the next Campaign go himself in Person to the War; and continue the same, as well in Winter, as in Summer, which would make such a Diversion in the Empire, as that the Emperor should not be able to make Head, nor so much as look the Ottoman Army in the Face. Notwith∣standing all which Assurances of the French Ambassador,He scarcely escapes the People. and Promises to furnish the Turkish Army with 30 able Ingineers; the People, or Rabble, would give little or no Credence to all his Engagements, and As∣surances; and scarce could the Great Men in the Government, preserve him from the Violence of the Soldiery and People. After the first Conference held, as we have said, by the Prime Officers; another was called, at which, the Resolution to continue the War, was confirmed by all there present, except two Persons only; namely, the Kadilescher of Rumelia, and the Chaimacam of Constantinople,Counsels held by the Prime Of∣ficers. who dis∣sented from the others, being of an Opi∣nion that a Peace was to be made by rea∣son that the War could not longer be Main∣tain'd; howsoever the major Party carrying it to the contrary, Commands were sent by an Express into Albania, to raise Forces in that Country; it being agreed on all Hands that they were the best Soldiers in the Empire, and had done extraordinary Service in the last Battle. In like manner at this Congress great were the Complaints against Murad Ghirei Han,Complaints against the Tartars, who commanded the Forces of Tar∣tary before Vienna, and shamefully ran a∣way; the which being proved against him, the Council chose another called Seffa Ghi∣rei, esteemed a good Soldier, and a Valiant Man, who was then at Jamboli, not far di∣stant from Adrianople; and upon this Ele∣ction, he was immediately dispatched a∣way to take Possession of his Government; for the Grand Seignior hath a Power to Depose, and Set up any Prince of the Crim Tartar, provided he continues him in the right Line of Sultan Galga: And for the Deposed Tartar to avoid all Disturbances and Contests, he was exiled together with his Son into the Island of Rhodes; and al∣so Battir Aga, who was the Chief Minister, and General of the Deposed Tartar, was Banished into the Island of Lemnos, situate in the Archipelago. After which divers Pasha's, and Officers of the Army, were called to this Congress, by whom several Complaints were made and exhibited against certain Captains,And a∣gainst other Pasha's of the Army and Soldiers of the Army, who in the last Bat∣tle
had ill behaved themselves and Coward∣ly betook themselves to flight. In which Accusations,August. single Allegations were suffi∣cient to Convict any Man; and upon the sole Testimony of one Person, many were proscribed, and in the Night privately with∣out Noise, were strangled, and in the Morning found Dead in their Beds;Are Pu∣nished: and amongst the rest was the Kahya of the late Deceased Vizier, put to Death at Belgrade, upon a Suggestion, that so soon as he had seen his Master Wounded, he betook him∣self to flight, and was followed by all the Pages of the Court, who were well Mount∣ed, and Armed, and might have done great Service had they not followed the Ignomi∣nious and Base Example of their Master. The like Fate attended the Spahilar-Aga∣see, or General of the Horse, who was said to have been the first to turn his Back on the Enemy. And at Adrianople three o∣ther Pasha's were put to Death, for the same Crime, or Default. After these Executions done, the Gene∣ral of the Janisaries was Named for not be∣having himself well, but because there are some Points of respect reserved for the Or∣der of Janisaries, he was only dismissed from his Government, and with a good Grace sent to be Pasha of Gaza, the meanest Pashaluck in the whole Empire; and this would have been a Favour, had they not sent an Executioner after him, and in his way taken off his Head, as is the usual Custom amongst the Turks; with such Or∣ders and Methods as these, the Turks reas∣sumed something of their Courage; dispat∣ching without delay Commands for Listing and Enrolling Janisaries, and other Orders of Militia, as also Timariots, Zaims, Seg∣men and others; and that they would aug∣ment their Numbers, as far as to 100000 Men, or at least to the same degree, as they were the last Year. But before we proceed farther on the Turkish side, we must look a little back, and see what the Germans are doing after so Signal a Victory. August.The 20th of this Month of August be∣ing the next Day after the Battle, some Parties of Hungarians, and Rascians were commanded to Pursue the Enemy in their Flight, which they did with such Expediti∣on,The Turks pursued by the Rasci∣ans. that they brought back with them, many of the Fugitives, dispersed, and stragling thro' Private Ways, and unknown Paths; and reported, That the whole Tur∣kish Army were Flying in the greatest Con∣fusion imaginable; and that a great part of them had already passed the Save, and had broken all the Bridges behind them; and that great Numbers of Dead Bodies, were found on the Roads, and covered the Ground for some Distance from the Camp: For which great Victory Te Deum was sang on the 21st,Te Deum sung. with a Triple Discharge of all the Guns, as well of those which were ta∣ken from the Turks, as those belonging to the Christian Army: And here on the 22th the Christian Army reposed, and rested it self in the Field of Battle. In the mean time before the News of the Victory, Colonel Mackeri, Governour of Verovitza, with a Party of 1600 Men, at∣tacked the Castle of Velicko, and having thrown some Bombs into it, it was forced to Surrender at Discretion, having had a∣bout 300 Men Killed, and not above 60 left Alive; the Booty was not great, unless it were the Releasement of Christian Priso∣ners, of which 300 obtained their Liber∣ty. The first Motion the Army made from the Field of Battle, was to Carlowitz, where the Duke of Holstein was Buried. The next Day, being the 25th, they marched to Peter Waradin, where the Dukes of Ah∣remberg, and Arschot, the General Souches, together with several other Officers, Died of their Wounds, the great Heats having contributed much to their Deaths. On the 30th, a General Council of War was held in the Imperial Army, at which it was resolved, That the Duke of Croy, Field-Marshal, with the Generals Saurau,A Resoluti∣on at a Council of War. and Hoffkirchen, and five Regiments of Horse, and as many of Foot, besides Ras∣cians and Hungarians, should March to∣wards Esseck to cover that Country, and Pass, and accordingly they began their March on the last of the Month, whilst Prince Lewis of Baden remained in the Camp to secure, and cover them in the Rear. Of all which Matters the News being sent to Vienna, both as to the Victory, and the Methods taken after it, we may ima∣gine that all the Imperial Court, as well as all Parts of Christendom, were filled with an extraordinary Joy for so signal a Victo∣ry; and as the Emperor sent his Gracious Encouragements to all the Officers; so more especially to the General Officers, de∣claring Prince Lewis of Baden; Lieutenant-General of the Imperial Army in Hungary;Pr. Lewis made Lieu∣tenant-Ge∣neral. where whilst these things were agitating, the News came of the Victory, which King William of England had gained at the Boyne in Ireland, which served to augment the Triumphs with another triple Discharge of all the Cannon in the Army. The Winter drawing near, the greatest part of the Turkish Militia, being under great Discouragements, and having a long Journey Home, thought fit to leave the Camp: So did the Tartars, Plundering all in
their way, so did the Arnouts, and Albani∣ans,Septemb. and all the Soldiers whose Towns, and Houses were not at a far distance; so likewise the Spahee's stole privately away,The Tur∣kish Forces disperse. and the Asiatick Horse made towards the Dardanelli, where they passed into Asia; and in this manner did all the Forces dis∣perse, that scarce any appearance remained of an Army, or a Camp; and those few who kept to their Colours, were possessed with great Consternation upon the News that the Poles had actually Invaded Wala∣chia, and brought great Destruction, and Ruine upon that Province. The Weather beginning now to be Cold and Wet, much incommoded the Soldiers of Prince Lewis his Army in their March, especially the Foot, who trashing through the Waters in a Country where was no Wood to Dry them, or Warm, and Dress their Victuals, many of them fell Sick and Died. And indeed that Country, as I have my self observed, hath neither Tim∣ber, nor Underwoods; so that the Inhabi∣tants live in Caves under Ground, the Soil being of a stiff Clay, grows hard with Fires, like a Stone; all their Fuel being Turf, of which, by the Laziness of the Inhabitants, a sufficient store had not been gathered to furnish the present use of the Army. Whilst the Army quartered in this Bar∣ren Country, News was brought to Prince Lewis, That General Veterani having heard of the Defeat of the Turks, had Decamped from Dobra, and was marched to Lippa; where coming before the Town, he sent his Summons to Surrender, which being refused,Lippa sur∣rendered to General Veterani some few Bombs were cast into it, which brought the Garrison to a Desire to Capitulate, but nothing would be granted but a Surrender at Discretion. In fine, all the Men, being 216 in num∣ber, were made Prisoners, together with three Pasha's, viz. Mahomet Bey, and one Ali Pasha (who had been sent thither for a Place of Banishment by the Grand Vizier) and also another Bey, with a Ziorbassi, or Captain. In the Town were three Guns, and two Mortar-pieces only, with a good quantity of Ammunition, but little of Pro∣visions. After which Count Guttensteyn was made Governour of the Place, with some Hundreds of Men for a Garrison: And whereas News was brought, That Te∣keli, with five or 6000 Men was Quarter∣ed about Temeswaer, it gave some Appre∣hensions of his Design to Invade Transilva∣nia; for which reason General Veterani kept his Station at Lippa to observe his Motions. In the mean time Prince Lewis continued his March to Segedin, where he refreshed his Army for some Days: And here it was that a certain Turk came from Belgrade un∣der a Pretence to demand the Exchange of 4000 Turks against so many Christians;Pr. Lewis continues his March. but this Proposal seeming fictitious, he was suspected for a Spy, seized, and commit∣ted to Prison. It being thought fit to secure Lippa late∣ly taken, the Prince sent his Adjutant-General with 12 Saicks laden with Provisi∣ons, and some Money, by way of the River Maroth to Lippa, to Mend and Re∣pair the Fortifications of that Place,Reinforces Lippa. and raise new ones where the Works were de∣fective; and for its better Reinforcement, 2000 Rascians, and Hungarians, both Horse and Foot, were sent to strengthen the Gar∣rison. The Prince likewise with the remaining part of the Army, marched to Zolnock, where the Horse having passed the Bridge for that purpose erected, met on the same Day of their Arrival, with the Field-Mar∣shal Count Mansfelt, and Major-General Aversberg at the same place,A Party of Tekeli's Men defea∣ted. who had late∣ly been detached in two Parties; the latter of which had the fortune to surprize a Par∣ty of 600 Men belonging to Tekeli, of whom they killed above 100, and made 32 Prisoners; which gave so great an A∣larm to others of their Companions, which were posted near Great Waradin, that in a precipitate Flight and Confusion, they be∣took themselves to their Heels, carrying withal their Bag and Baggage, with what∣soever else was portable. Nor was Count Schlick who Command∣ed the Blockade of Great Waradin, less suc∣cessful; for having received Information, That some Hundreds of Oxen belonging to that Garrison, were Grasing in the Mea∣dows near thereunto; posted himself with 400 Horse in a small Wood over against the Place,C. Schlick defeats a Party from Gr. Wa∣radin. ordering some Hussars to drive the Oxen towards the Wood where he lay in Ambuscade. The Hussars following their Instructions in driving the Cattle, were pur∣sued by the Garrison till they came near the Wood, when Schlick sallied out upon them, and so vigorously Attack'd them, that 400 Turks were killed on the Place, many Prisoners taken, and the Oxen car∣ried clear away to the great damage of that Garrison. This Success was followed by another of the like Nature, for Schlick having un∣derstood from the Prisoners, that a conside∣rable Body of Tekeli's Men were Quarter∣ed in a Village on the other side of the City; he took the opportunity of the Night to pass silently along, and without any Noise surprize them, and killed most of them in their Quarters, after which
he repassed with the like Privacy back without the least opposition, to his own Camp. It being now divulged that the Design of Prince Lewis was to turn the Blockade of Great Waradin into a Formal Siege, Count Aversberg was Detached from the Army with a Body of Dragoons and Pio∣neers, to Mend and Repair the Roads which were become almost unpassable, e∣specially for Cannon, and Waggons laden with Provisions and Necessaries for the Army. Count Schlick who was not as yet privy to this Design of the Prince, observing by his Motion, That Great Waradin was to be formally Besieged, he privately con∣veyed himself and Troops into some Islands between the Rivers Korosh and Bozze, and drove away the Enemies Cattle, being a∣bout 900 Head, and took some Prisoners from under the very Walls of the City, and brought them all to his Camp. As Schlick returned, the Turks of the Place called to him, and the Pasha desired a Parly with him in the open Field upon Parole, which Schlick refused to do, until he understood that Count Marsigli, and his Chiaus were in the Town, having been employed on the Negotiation of Peace;Count Mar∣sigli and his Chiaus at Great Waradin. and then he yielded to an Interview with the Pasha, who declared to him, That the loss of their Cattle droven from under their Walls, was not so much caused by the Negligence of the Garrison, as by their attention to their New Guests, whom they were entertain∣ing with all Freedom and Friendship; and so would seem to insinuate that for that reason, it would be but Just and Agreeable to the Laws and Rights of War, that they should be again restored; but Schlick wou'd understand none of these Laws and Cere∣monies, but retired without other Answer, and Count Marsigli was suffered to go to the Camp of Prince Lewis. October.On the first of October, the Prince conti∣nued his March, and on the 10th arrived within a League of Great Waradin, where the next Day he joyned with all the Foot, and received Intelligence, That Tekeli had released General Heusler on Parole, whom he had some time before taken Prisoner; and that he was already come as far as Hermanstadt: And from hence it was, that Count Marsigli, with the Turkish Chiaus, was also dispatched to the English Ambassa∣dor at Adrianople; of whose Death they had not as yet received any Report whilst the Prince of Baden was making Prepara∣tions for a Siege before Great Waradin, the Duke of Croy Attacked the Fortress of Brod in Sclavonia, in which there was a Garrison of 300 Turks; who upon ap∣pearance of the Enemy before the Walls, put out five Red Ensigns; and in a manner of Defiance and Scorn, Danced upon the Ramparts; but this Sport continued not long; for the Duke that Evening took a Post near the Walls with 400 Men, and im∣mediately began to Work; and notwith∣standing the continual Fire of the Enemy, they finished a Battery before One in the Morning, together with a Line of Com∣munication, on which they planted four Guns, and one Mortar-piece, and before Day began to batter the Town:Brod de∣s rted by thē Turks; The Turks affrighted hereat withdrew, and retired in∣to a Fort on the other side of the River, leaving two small Guns, and some Pedre∣ros behind them; and the Place unto their Enemy, who took possession of it, and therein placed 150 Germans to defend it. Howsoever the Turks continued to Fire out of their Fort on the other side, but without any considerable Damage to the Germans; for they remained not long there, before they deserted that Fortress also, being ter∣rified to see Percilie a Rascian Captain with 80 Hussars,And fly to another Fort. and about 100 Foot in small Boats to pass the Save; and hearing in the Night the Sound of Trumpets and Drums, and all sorts of Instruments to play, they were immediately struck with a fear, and apprehension that the whole Imperial Ar∣my had passed the River with intention next Morning to Attack them,Which was also desert∣ed by them; and flying into the Woods, are for the most part cut off. with which ima∣gination affrighting one the other, they retired in a confused manner out of the Fort towards the Forests and Woods, being in all about 1500 Persons, besides the Pea∣sants of the Country, who with Arms in their Hands, but without any Order fled into the same Forrests; but being pursued by the Hussars and some German Horse, they were cut down, and most of them Killed, very few escaping alive. In the mean time Prince Lewis was busied in preparing things, and putting all in a readiness for the Siege of Great Waradin; and Commanded Count Stirum, with a con∣siderable Body of Men, and some Artillery to approach nearer to the City, and soon after followed in Person with all the Horse and Foot, pitching his Camp on the Banks of the River Korosch; and having planted a Battery on a rising Ground, he shot into the Town, and raked the Streets from one end unto the other: At the same time also two Mortar-pieces being well fixed threw into the City several Bombs, which set Fire to the Houses, and burnt whole Streets. In this Consternation the Besieged attemp∣ted nothing by Sally, but only plyed their Great Guns, and set Fire to the Hay and Straw, of which they had raised great Stacks in their Gardens, and void Places of
the City, least the Enemy should serve themselves of it. The Bombs continued firing, whilst Bar∣fus General of the Brandenburghers, and Count Guido of Staremberg, with nine Bat∣talions, placed themselves in a deep Ground, where they could not be overseen by the Enemy, from whence 1500 Men issued in the Night, and opened the Trenches, whilst others were busied in raising a Battery over-against the Gate of the Palancha Ottorsi,Great Waradin Attacked. on the Right Hand of which, a Redoubt was made, between which, and the Battery, a Line of Communication was drawn; by this time a Battery of six great Guns was per∣fected, and began to play; which the E∣nemy answered with their Guns from the Wall, firing without any intermission: The six Guns being at some distance, did not the execution which was desired; and therefore the Night following the Battery was brought nearer to the Palanca which was on the Right Hand; and next Night a New Battery was raised to the Left Hand of it; on which Guns and Mortar-pieces being planted, many Houses were set on Fire, and a great part of the Palanca consumed by them: Howsoever the Turks labouring with all Diligence possible, re∣paired what Damage and Ruine the great Guns had done, which they easily did; for the Walls being for the most part made of a strong sort of Timber, or Oak, which doth not Shiver, or Splinter, the Bullet made no greater Hole in the Walls than the size of the Shot; besides which, the Ditch was very deep about them, and six Paces broad; howsoever by frequent firing, the Holes became so wide and large, as gave Encouragement to make a Storm on the Walls; the which was ordered for the 16th at Night. General Barfus, and Count Staremberg Commanded the Attack, which was performed with the greatest Resoluti∣on imaginable: The Musqueteers with Hatchets in their Hands ran to the Gates, in which the Guns having made several Holes, they cut them down with the more ease. On the other side Col. Mollner's Heydukes,The Palan∣ca of Great Waradin taken. stormed the Walls with much Bravery and Resolution; one of them Kneeling down, supporting himself on his Hands and Arms, another stood upon him, whilst a third climbing over both, with his Scymiter in his Mouth, threw himself in∣to the Palanca; and in this manner many of them having passed the Wall, began to cut down all that were before them; with which the Turks being terrified, aban∣doned the Fort, and fled over the Bridge into the City. This place being thus taken, with the loss of very few Men, some Guns were found in it, with one Mortar-piece only. Some Battalions being lodged in the Pa∣lanca, Prince Lewis with his Army passed the Rivers of Korosch and Poze, and En∣camped on the other side of the Town, where that Night 1500 Men were Com∣manded to open the Trenches,The Town Besieged. which was performed with much diligence, and a Bat∣tery was raised, and another also in the Palanca of Ollorsi now taken. The Hussars in the mean time Encamped on the other side, to distress and streighten the City the more narrowly; and now the Approaches being constantly carried on nearer, and nearer; and another Battery raised, on which 11 Guns were planted, they began to fire from thence and from the Palanca, with a like Number into the Streets which much annoyed the Town. These Batteries fired so constantly on the Walls, that a sufficient Breach was made, on which to make an Assault, and accordingly a Storm was appointed for the 24th of this Month, which the Turks perceiving by the Prepa∣rations that were made, had not the Cou∣rage to stand the Shock, but setting fire to the City, which they believed they could not maintain, retired to a Fort which they had raised between the City, and the Fortress; the City being now on Fire, and no opposition on the Walls, the Ger∣mans crowded into it with great Throngs, where they took much Cattle, and relea∣sed some Hundreds of Rascians, who were Inhabitants in that City, which the Turks, had they not been prevented, had carried off with them. The resigning this Place, which was so well fortified with several Retrenchments and Works one behind the other, was to the great Wonder of the Germans, who hereby were well advertised, and assured of the fear of the Turks; by which they took fresh Courage, and post∣ed themselves in the great City over a∣gainst the Fortress, and in the space of two Days, they advanced very near to the Ditch of the Fortress; and in two Days more they finished a Work on which they planted 18 Mortar-pieces, and from thence threw such quantities of Bombs into the Fortress, and with that effect, that one of them falling into one of the Magazines of Powder, it blew up, and showed a dread∣ful Spectacle of the Arms and Heads of Men carried into the Air. The Turks having other Magazines of Powder and Provisions remained resolute in their Defence; and on the other side the Christian Army continued to throw Bombs into the Fortress, by which a Steeple took fire, which spread it self through the whole Fortress, and in less than six Hours time one half thereof was reduced to Ashes:
In the mean time a Party of Tartars of a∣bout 600 fell in upon the Foragers, and took both the Men and Horses, and Booty which they had by them, but being im∣mediately pursued and overtaken by the Hussars, all was seized again and brought to the Camp with seven Heads, and three Prisoners. Novemb.The Month of November being now en∣tered, the Turks began to be of Opinion, that the Christians could not continue long before the Place; for that the long and wet Nights, Snow, and Frosts of that Coun∣try must needs force them to raise the Siege; the Consideration of which moved the Pasha of the Place to refuse the accep∣tance of the Prince's second Summons; saying, That there would be time enough for that six Months hence. This Answer obli∣ged the Besiegers to throw their Bombs continually into the Fortress, to force the Turks, so soon as was possible, to a Surren∣der: But in regard the bad Weather came on, and that Forage became so scarce in the Camp, that many of the Horses died, tho' Provision for Men was plentiful and cheap; it was concluded by the General Officers, that the Season of the Year was too far ad∣vanced for continuance of the Siege; and therefore it was esteemed most adviseable to turn it to a Blockade; but before the Germans bid a Farewell to the Place, they beat down a great Tower with their Can∣non, on which the Turks having planted se∣veral Guns, did very much annoy the Ger∣mans. On the 2d Instant the throwing of Bombs was continued, and a Great Fort was raised for the securing of the Posts if the advanced Season of the Year, and the Obstinacy of the Turks should oblige the Prince to raise the Siege, and to leave the City narrowly Blocked up during the Win∣ter. On the 3d the Cannon of the Besiegers beat down a great Tower on which the Be∣sieged had several Guns which much in∣commoded the Germans. The 4th and 5th the Guns and Mortar-pieces of the Besiegers continually fired on the Turks. That Day a Polish Envoy, who came into the Prince's Army some Days before, departed from thence for Tockay to expect there the Arrival of the Plenipoten∣tiaries both of the Allies and Turks, who had appointed to meet there for the reassu∣ming of the Treaties of Peace. But about this time Forage begun to be very scarce to be had in the Army, the Horse being obliged to fetch their Hay sive Miles off, for which reason many Horses pe∣rished, but Provisions for the Army were plentiful and cheap enough. Several of Teke∣li's Men came over to the Prince before Wa∣radin; all which unanimously confirmed, That the Body of Turks, Tartars, and Re∣bels, (or Tekelians) which hitherto were Encamped between Gena and Gyula, suffer∣ed extreamly for want of Provisions, be∣ing for the most part obliged to sustain themselves with Wild Fruits, which caused them to Die in great Numbers; their Hor∣ses wanting Forage, perished likewise in abundance. On the 6th Instant cold Rains and Snow began, and continued until the 10th, not∣withstanding which the Bombing continu∣ally went forward; the Prince also sent a Letter to the Basha-Governour, Summon∣ing him to Surrender the Fortress, which Letter the Basha would not at all receive, but told the Bearer it was not yet time to speak of Capitulations or Surrendring that Fortress. The 10th of November,Novemb. 10th. (on which Day the Rascian Lieutenant-Colonel Antonio, returned back to the Army with 400 Wa∣góns, which he had taken from Tekeli as he marched homewards) the great Fort distant five or 600 Paces from the Gate of the Fortress, was finished and brought to its entire Perfection, which Fort was more elevated and higher than the Walls and Bat∣teries of the Fortress, in which 1000 Ger∣mans and some Hundred were Commanded as a Garrison: Besides this Fort, a lesser was made on a certain Eminence, from whence the Guns fired in the inside and Streets of the Fortress which was provided with a proportionable Garrison. In the Great City of Waradin, a far greater Gar∣rison of Horse and Foot than that in the Great Fort was ordered, and Colonel Moll∣ner was Commanded to remain in the Pa∣lanca Ollorsi with his Regiment of Hussars, and some Foot, which being thus ordered, and by that means the Fortress so closed up, that nothing could come out or go in∣to it, there being also not the least ap∣pearance of any Succours to relieve the Place, the Prince thought it more expedi∣ent to send his Army into Winter-Quarters in the Neighbouring Villages, and Cities of Debrezin, and St. Job, then to expose them to the hardships of the long cold Nights, Wet and Snowy-Weather, especi∣ally since Count Tekeli was already de∣camped from about Gyula, and marched with his ruined and fatigued Army of Turks, and Tartars, and Rebels to Winter-Quarters, as it was confirmed by upwards of 300 Tekelians Deserted from him, and arrived at Lippa, Zolnock, Belnesch, or in the Army, since that our Trenches also were carried on to the very Ditch of the Fortress; that their Bridges over the said
Ditches were beaten down, and most of the Water drained thereout, that their Works were so ruined that none dared to show himself, our Guns continually firing on the inside, that our Bombs, and the noi∣some stinking Smell of some Fireworks, to∣gether with the restless State of the Besieg∣ed, who were always forced to stand on their Guard, and continually alarmed, ha∣ving no shelter but some Sellars and Vaults, could not but oblige them e're long to Ca∣pitulate, or Perish by Fatigues and other Wants: All which, I say, being considered by the Prince of Baden, he having provided his Forts, Palanca, and the City with Gar∣risons very commodiously placed, sent the rest of his Army into Winter-Quarters. The Blockade being thus resolved, a Great Fort was raised for securing the se∣veral Posts, being about the distance of five or 600 Paces from the Gate of the Fortress; this Fort was built upon an Eminence or some higher Ground than the Walls and Batteries of the Fortress; for defence of which, above 1000 Germans were appoint∣ed for the Garrison:The Manner of the Blockade. Besides this, a smaller Fort was also raised on a rising Ground, and furnished with a good Garrison, from whence they could shoot into the Streets and Houses of the Fortress. Moreover the City it self of Great Waradin was main∣tained with a more numerous Garrison, than what the Turks had in their Fortress; and the Palanca of Ollorsi was Commanded by Col. Mollner, and Garrison'd with his Regiment of Hussars, with some Foot. Things being thus secured, and the For∣tress on all sides closed up, that nothing could go out, or come into it; the Prince judged it more necessary to send his Army into Winter-Quarters in the Neighbouring Villages,Pr. Lewis marches off and Cities of Debrezin, and St. Job, then to expose them to the Hard∣ships of Long, Dark, and Wet Nights, and Snowy Weather, which began to fall in great abundance. In which Resolution the Prince was the more confirmed by the Report of 300 of Tekeli's Men, who had Deserted their Commander; and assured the Prince upon Oath, That Tekeli with his Turks and Tartars, was already De∣camped with his Army about Giula, and marched into Winter-Quarters. So now we must leave the Prince and his Army also in their Quarters, and the For∣tress of the Turks straitly Blockaded, until about the Months of May and June 1692, next ensuing. Thus have we finished the Relations of the Successes in the Campaign for the Year 1691; the which proved as Unfortunate to the Turkish Affairs, and Arms, as most of the former Years since the beginning of this War; and when things go Unluckily Abroad, we cannot expect that they should look very Smiling, or Pleasant at Home. The Sultan who had fansied to himself mighty things under the Auspicious Con∣duct of Mustapha Pasha Kupriogli, such as an entire Victory in the Field over the Ger∣mans, and as the Consequences thereof, the Surrender of Oseck and Buda, and all other Cities and Fortresses in Hungary, which du∣ring these Wars, had yielded themselves to the Victorious Arms of the Emperor, being now on a sudden fallen from the hopes of all those things, (which with a strong Fan∣cy and Imagination he had figured in his Mind; by a quite contrary Event, he was so Surprized and struck with the sudden News, That his Army was Defeated, his General the Grand Vizier killed, with the Flower of the Turkish Militia, all the Can∣non taken, and the Camp exposed to the Violence and Rapine of the German Soldi∣ery; his Spirits so sunk within him,Sultan Achmet fallen into a Fever by ill News. that he did nothing but Sigh, and being posses∣sed with a Lumpish Melancholy, fell often into heavy, but not refreshing Sleeps; so that having his Mind troubled in the Day, and his Fancy with Horrid Dreams in the Night, he fell into a Fever, which endan∣gered his Life; and gave occasion to the People to Talk much of his Death, and setting up in the Throne Sultan Mustapha, the Son of Sultan Mahomet IV, who had been Deposed: But this Passion of Mind which possessed the Grand Seignior, passing over with a little Time, he being Natural∣ly of a Jolly Temper,He Rece∣vers. given to Musick and Wine, his Fever quitted him, and he recovered. So also did the Old Ali Pasha, who had been Chimacam at Adrianople; and upon the Death of Kupriogli (as we have said) was made Grand Vizier, his Disease was the same with that of the Grand Seignior, proceeding from Afflicting himself at the News of the Rout of the whole Tur∣kish Army, and the Apprehensions he had of new Turbulencies arising thereupon a∣mongst the Soldiery, the which had struck him with a kind of Apoplexy, and a Stu∣pidity in his Understanding;The Grand Vizier sick, and reco∣vered. but it went off, so soon, as he perceived the Soldiery to return more mildly Home than was ex∣pected, and then he began to revive, and take upon him the Power and Authority of his Government. He was an Ancient Man, and of great Experience, but he was neither esteemed for a Wise, nor an Under∣taking Man, which are two Qualities very necessary in a Grand Vizier. But the Mufti made some amends for the Inabilities of that Great Minister; for being a Person
of a deep Understanding, and highly e∣steemed by all Parties for his profound Wis∣dom, he became very helpful to the Grand Vizier,His Quali∣fications. who had the good quality to hear∣ken unto the Counsels of those who were wiser than himself; it being one of his In∣firmities to be irresolute, which shows an Imbecility of Mind; and is a quality the most disagreeable to an absolute Monarchy. But being pushed forward by his Friends, he governed well; for being a Man not very Avaritious, (as few Turks but are) he preferred none but such as were Men of Merit, and had signalized themselves by long Services, or some great or good Acti∣ons; his Country was Bosnia, which hath given many Valiant and Stout Soldiers to the Turks, being reputed Men of Bravery, and Fidelity in their Words and Acti∣ons. Never had the Ottoman Empire, since it came to be an Empire, more need of Able, Valiant, and Wise Men, than at present; and never were they more rare and hard to be found: For what with the War which destroyed their brave, and best of their Gallant Soldiers, and Commanders; and with their Seditions, and Tumults at Home, in which their Principal Officers, both Civil and Military, were cut off; none remained alive but only Upstarts, or some Leaders of the Insolent, or Seditious Soldiery: And this was the State of the Empire, not only oppressed by the Victo∣rious Enemy on the Frontiers; but by a want of all things at Adrianople, even to a Famine, which raised the Out-cries and Clamours of the People against the Go∣vernment, which being joyned to the A∣buse of Copper-Money, (than which, at that time no other was to be seen, or cur∣rantly passed) discouraged the Country-Men from bringing Provisions to the Mar∣ket, and caused the People more earnestly to cry out for a Peace, and exclaim against the French, for having now for four Years engaged them in a War the most Bloody, the most Ruinous, and most destructive to the Ottoman Empire that was ever known. The French Ambassador fearing that these Tumults, and the Inclinations of some of the Ministers would at length prevail for a Peace, he bestowed his Money very liberally, where he thought it might be well placed (for as yet the French King wanted not Money, as he did some Years afterwards) but he could not as yet fix any on the Chimacam Chusaein Pasha at Constantinople, who al∣ways told the Ambassador's Servants, that he wanted none of his Presents, being well provided with what was necessary for his Maintenance, and Equipage. The Diffi∣culty of this Great Minister's Proceedings did not a little trouble the Thoughts of the Ambassador, especially when he had understood that this Chimacam had wrote to the Mufti to perswade to a Peace,The Chima∣cam of Constan∣tinope, an  my to the French. the League with France being apparently de∣structive to the Empire; saying, as it were, How long shall these People be a Snare to us? And hereof the Ambassador was the more apprehensive when he heard that the Sul∣tan was returning to Constantinople for his Health; being perswaded by the Physici∣ans, That the Air of that City and the Sea, would be more conducing to his Health, than that of Adrianople; by which he fear∣ed, that the Chimacam might have the bet∣ter opportunity to instill these Imaginations into the Head of the Grand Seignior, than he could at a distance. But before the Departure of the Grand Seignior from Adrianople for Constantinople, a General Council of War was held by all the Chief Officers of the Army: At which three principal Points were concluded. The First was,Resolutions at a Coun∣cil of War. To do their best Endea∣vours, and use all possible means for the Relief of Great Waradin: But on the other side it was considered, That the Militia on the Frontiers was tyred out, and become weak by their Labours and Disgraces of the preceding Campaign; so that the Means for executing this Design was not prescribed. A Second Proposal was not to conside much in the Counsels of the French; but to consult the Opinion of the Soldi∣ery, whether they were inclinable to a Peace. And Thirdly, In case the Soldiery shou'd be averse to a Peace, that then Preparati∣ons should be made with all diligence to raise Men, and make Provisions of War for the ensuing Year. But whilst Matters were disposing to quiet the Minds of the Soldiery, of which great Numbers were passed over into Asia, much harassed and discontented; so that some Insurrections were feared in those Countries:Tumults a∣gainst Cop∣per-Money. Behold on a sudden the Peo∣ple murmured against the base Allay of the Money, which was nothing but Copper, or at best mixed with a little Silver, which was a mighty prejudice to Trade, and cau∣sed a dearness of all Provisions, so that the Poor were almost Starved; whereupon the Rabble, in a furious manner, assaulted the Mint-Office, and Killed the Master who was set over the Coinage, and committed many other Insolences, and were not ap∣peased until an Order was published, That
the Copper-Money should be no longer Currant; at which the People dispersing, Silver-Money was issued from the Mint; where the Officers worked Day and Night in Coining Aspers, and greater Money; and with Promises of being paid shortly in this Money, the Soldiers were very much plea∣sed and satisfied; tho' the Discontents of the Asiatick Soldiers, gave great Apprehen∣sions and Fears to the Port of some Revolt or Insurrection in Asia; which had it at that time happened, it had in all probabi∣lity produced a Peace. But this Blessing both to the Christians and the Turks, was reserved for a more happy time; as we shall see, if God gives us Life, some Years afterwards; with which we shall put a Pe∣riod to this History. Anno 1692. THE English Ambassador Sir William Hussey, designed to Negotiate the Peace, together with Monsieur Colyer the Ambassador of Holland, between the Em∣peror and the Sultan Achmet (as we have said) being Dead, an end was put for the present to that Negotiation, and the Am∣bassador of Holland returned back from A∣drianople, without being able to effect any thing in order thereunto; the Resolution of continuing the War, was the loud Re∣port, and Discourse common in the Mouths of all People; and that no Treaty should be set on Foot,The Turks resolve to continue the War. until the Recovery of Buda from the Germans, and of Morea from the Venetians; and herein were the Turks more animated by the Assurances of the French Ambassador, that his Master was sending two great Men of War from France, laden with Bombs, Granadoes, Carcasses, and with all sorts of Military Preparations, and with them 200 French Engineers, and Gun∣ners, of great Experience in the Manage∣ment of Fire-Works, and other Warlike Instruments, fit, and proper both for Sea, and Land: And farther to show his Zeal in this Cause, the Ambassador promised to go himself in Person to the War. To give more life to the Ambassador's Words, the Son-in-Law to Tekeli returned from France, and in the beginning of this Year arrived at Smyrna, whence immedi∣ately without any stop, or stay, he took Post for Adrianople, being fully freighted with Letters, and Promises from the French King to the Sultan, and presents to the Chief Officers of State to perswade them to Continue, and Maintain the War; so that now all Thoughts and Imaginati∣ons of a Peace were vanished, and laid a∣side. Wherefore in order to a War, a Project was laid by the two Cadileskers, or Chief Justices, to raise both Men and Money by a more easie way, and manner, than had formerly been done; for these being the Chief Justices on whom all the other Infe∣riour Justices of the Empire depended, an Exact and Secret Calculate was made of the true Number of the Spahees, and of the People in the several Provinces, and Di∣stricts through the whole Empire. This Calculate was secretly carried to the Vizier, and Mufti, where after it had been very seriously debated, it was well approved, as a Means to ease the Publick Treasury, by a more equal Tax on all Vil∣lages and Towns, according to the Num∣ber of the Inhabitants, and hereon a great Foundation was made of raising many Thousands of Men, and much more Mo∣ney than the last Year. During all this time, the Turks remain∣ed in great apprehension of some suddain Insurrection of the Arabs, and discontent∣ed Militia in Asia; and whereas the great∣est danger appeared to be in the Parts,A Teftish Pasha sent into Asia. and Country of Sebaste or Sivas; a Teftish Pa∣sha, or General Inquisitor was sent with a strong Party of Horse, to enquire after all loose People, Vagabonds, or such as could give no good Account of themselves, with a full Power of Life, and Death, which the Turks commonly execute with all Rigour, and Arbitrary Power imaginable. I have known a Teftish Pasha sent into Asia, to enquire after Vagabonds, with a Party of 500 Men, who pitching his Tents near some Town, or Village, into which he hath sent some of his Men to take up such Per∣sons as the People should offer to them for disorderly Livers, the which being brought before the Pasha, the Imaum, or Parish Priest hath also been cited; and setting the Persons before him in Rank and Order, it hath been demanded of the Imaum, Whe∣ther such a Person be a Good Man, or not? How he Lives? What Trade he follows? Or, Whether he comes constantly to the Mosche to Prayers, according to the Rules which the Alchoran requires? In case the Imaum answers, that he knows him not, or his Way of Living; or that he is not a Good Man, he is immediately, without other Process, Accusation, or Proof, Hang∣ed up upon some Tree, or Bough, which is near to the Pasha's Camp. Howsoever this could not hinder two Princes of the Arabs, belonging to Arabia Deserta, from Robbing, and Infesting the Countries about Damascus, who gave a stop to all Mahometan Pilgrims going to Mecca, until they had paid such Cafar, or Head-Money for their Passage, as they de∣manded,
and until the Grand Seignior had paid them a very considerable Sum in Gold for what was in Arrears due formerly from the Mahometan Pilgrims. In the mean time an Ambassador from Persia to the Grand Seignior, arrived at Scutari, which is a Town in Asia on the o∣ther side of the Water, just opposite to Con∣stantinople, to which Place, upon the News hereof, the Chimacam sent over four Com∣missaries to Entertain him. The Train, and Equipage of this Ambassador was very Noble and Great, having an Attendance with him of 338 Persians bravely Mount∣ed on Horse-back, and richly Habited, with 60 Camels laden with Presents for the Grand Seignior, and his Court; consisting of very rich Persian Carpets interwoven with Gold;A Persian Ambassa∣dor at A∣drianople. as also many Vests of Cloth of Gold, besides other Gallantries, and Ra∣rities of that Country, with an Elephant, and 12 White Camels. This Ambassador stayed not more than a Night at Scutari, before he passed over into Europe, and continued his Journey to Adrianople, where the 2d of the Month of February,February. he made a Solemn, and a State∣ly Entry; he was a Person of a Comely Stature, of a Chearful Countenance, Pru∣dent, and Generous in his Behaviour, which are Qualities greatly taking in all Courts of the World. In his Retinue he had the Sons of several Princes of Persia, which served to add unto the Splendour, and Grandeur of his Embassy. He was Lodged, by Command of the Sultan, in that Magnificent Palace of Kara Mustapha, the late Vizier, which was richly Furnished for him; but there was no great need of any of the Turkish Moveables, for he had spread the Rooms with his own Rich Car∣pets, and other Coverings, the like of which had never been seen in the Ottoman Court. Moreover all the Kettles, and U∣tensils of the Kitchin were all of Silver, to∣gether with the Tables, such as never any Ambassador had before: And for better Adornment of this Noble Palace, there were certain Fountains which spouted Wa∣ter as high as the Upper Story of the House. The Original Intention of this Embassy was designed at first to Congratu∣late the coming of Sultan Solyman to the Throne; but the News of Solyman's Death meeting the Ambassador on the Road; and that Sultan Achmet his Brother, had suc∣ceeded to his Place; the Ambassador staid on the way for other Instructions, which were not altered at the Persian Court in any other manner, than only to change the Name of Solyman in the Credential Letters, to that of Achmet. The Turks hastned the Return of this Ambassador so much as was possible; how∣soever his Departure could not be precipi∣tated before the usual and common time of other Ambassadors, to whom it is the Cu∣stom to show the Lutfé, or the solemn man∣ner of giving out the Pay to the Janisaries in the Divan, where the Ambassador is Treated with a Dinner at the Vizier's Ta∣ble; but this not being to be performed until the 25th of March, the Turks, who had magnified so much the Grandeur of their Empire to the Persians on all Occasi∣ons, were in a Bodily Fear, least in the mean time some Unhappy and Dishonour∣able News should come from the Frontiers; or that the Persians should discover the Weakness of the Ottoman Force, who for∣merly used to boast of 2 or 300000, could now scarce bring an Army of 60000 Men into the Field; howsoever the Arrival of this Ambassador did not a little trouble the Minds of some principal Turks, who be∣ing affectionate to their Country and Peo∣ple, would be very sorry to have the Na∣kedness thereof discovered to their Insult∣ing Neighbours. The Day of the Ambassador's Audience being come, a Horse was sent out of the Grand Seignior's Stable, for the Ambassa∣dor to Ride upon, richly adorned with Furniture and Trappings, according to the Custom; likewise 47 Chiauses with their Aga, were also appointed, with an Oda,The Persi∣an Ambas∣sador's Manner of going to Audience. or Chamber of Janisaries, with their Ciorba∣gee, or Captain, and likewise that Aga which had been sent lately into Persia, to notifie the Exaltation of Sultan Solyman: Being now returned, they all with the Am∣bassador's own Retinue, attended to con∣duct him to his Audience with the Grand Seignior. Things being put into this Posture, the Ambassador in a Glorious Habit, and great Pomp mounted on Horse-back; the Pre∣sents were all sent before, valued in Per∣sia at 100000 Dollars, but being at Con∣stantinople, might be esteemed at double the Value; they were carried by Camels covered with Cloth of Gold, each of them bearing two great Chests, in which were Cloaths Embroidered with Gold, and Cloth of Gold, the finest Linen of Persia, some Pieces of them were worked with Golden Thread: Besides there were Persian Gir∣dles very rich; Turbants of the finest sort proper for Princes; some Bows and Qui∣vers with Arrows Richly Inlaid; some great and large Pieces of Amber, with a good quantity of Lignum Aloes, the most Precious sort of any in India, of which much is consumed in the Grand Seignior's Seraglio; some Strings of large Pearl of the biggest Size, with many other Gallan∣tries,
and Curiosities of India; Five very fine Persian Horses, covered with Cloth of Gold: Sixty large Camels, of which 30 were laden with Persian Carpets woven with Silk and Gold-Thread, with various Colours rarely mixed: These Camels were sent before by 30 Persians on Horse∣back, very richly Cloathed. The Ambassador himself was Cloathed with the most Rich Tissue and Weighty Cloth of Gold that could possibly be made; On his Head he had a Cap in form and Manner of a Crown, with Seven Feathers, the Handles of which were studded with Jewels and Precious Stones; the like Ha∣bit the Vice-Ambassador wore, being ap∣pointed to succeed in the Embassy, in case the first should fail by any Accident; and before him five Horses were led. Next fol∣lowed the Secretary with the Credential Letters in a Bag of Cloth of Gold, which he carried in his Hand lifted up as high as his Head, on which he wore a Turbant Embroidered with Gold, with four Fea∣thers. On one side of the Ambassador rode the Chiaus-Bashee, and on the other the Vice-Ambassador, and by his side, the Aga who was returned from Persia; these were immediately followed by two Persians with Beards, well Mounted, and richly Ha∣bited, who were the Masters of the Horse, each carrying a Scimetar in the Scabbard richly adorned with Jewels, and carried under the Arm after the Turkish Fashion: Next followed the Attendance of 60 Men on Horse-back, with Beards cut short after the Persian Fashion, all well Habited, a∣mongst which was not one, whose Beard was not grown, for the Young Youths were left at Home, being Scandalous to show them Abroad. When the Ambassador and Vice-Ambas∣sador were come into the Divan, where the Grand Vizier was present,March. they caused them to sit down in the Rank with the Vi∣ziers of the Bench, amongst which the Chimacam of Adrianople, was reckoned; but he who carried the Letters stood all the time during the Lutfé, or Payment of the Soldiers; after which, according to the u∣sual Custom, they all sate down to Din∣ner, where the Grand Vizier was present: After which they were richly Vested, but without Sables, and with them 60 others of the Retinue had Vests, which is much more than what are given to the Ambassa∣dors of the Emperor, the Kings of Eng∣land, France, or Holland; to the first of which, as I remember, are given 35 Vests, and to those of the two Kings 22 a piece, and to that of Holland 19; by which we may observe the Value which the Turks put on the Persian, before those of the Chri∣stian Powers. After the Audience with the Grand Seignior was performed, they re∣turned to their Lodgings in the same man∣ner as they came from thence. This Audience being over, the Turks ho∣ped that the Persian Ambassador would im∣mediately, and without farther delay re∣turn back to his Master, the King of Per∣sia; but the Ambassador had other Intenti∣ons in his Mind: For being desirous to be a Spectator of the Confusions amongst the Turks at Home,The Persi∣an Ambas∣sador con∣tinues at Adriano∣ple against the Incli∣nation of the Turks and the Weakness of their Army on the Frontiers, he pretended to re∣new the Ancient Capitulations, which had been made between the Persians and the Turks, which was a good Excuse to delay Time: And tho' notwithstanding the Re∣port caused to be spread Abroad, That the Indians had declared War against the Persi∣ans, it little moved the Ambassador from his Purpose of delaying his Departure, that he might the better discover the Weak∣ness and Nakedness of the Turks, whose Affairs could not go well Abroad, whilst they were governed by an unable Head at Home; for the Grand Vizier was Old,A Chara∣cter of the Grand Vi∣zier. The Artifi∣ces of his Son. and Cholerick, and had it not been for his Son, who was a Person well in Years, Di∣ligent, and Considerative, who Discour∣sed, and Prepared all Matters, weighed, and consulted them with Persons of Expe∣rience, and Understanding, he could never have carried them to any Maturity, or re∣mained long in that Sublime Office. Be∣sides, he was Naturally Cruel, that upon the least Suspicion, or Murmurings of any Pasha, or great Man, he without the least noise sent the Bow-string for him, and pri∣vately cut him off: Amongst the rest, there was one Omer Pasha, who having in seve∣ral Fights signalized himself by his Brave∣ry, seemed to aspire unto some high de∣gree of Preferment; whereof the Vizier growing Jealous, he sent and took him off. But what most confirmed him was; that he promised the Militia to deliver out their Pay to them, at the end of every three Months in good Gold and Silver, and not in Copper-Money, against which there had been such Outcries, and Tumults amongst the People; to perform which Promise, (for there was no dallying with the Licen∣tious Soldiery) the Gold and Silver-Smiths were commanded to shut up their Shops, and prohibited to Work or make any Ves∣sels of Gold, or Silver,The Arts by which the Grand Vizier with kept in his Office. but to bring the Gold and Silver which they had in their Hands, into the Mint, there to be Coined into good Money, which so altered on a sudden the manner of Traffick in Buying and Selling, that none of the Copper-Mo∣ney would pass in Payments under three or four for one; by which Artifices and Pro∣jects,
he kept up, and secured the Govern∣ment to himself for some time: To which we may add one thing more, which recon∣ciled the Minds of the Mufti, and of the Ulama, and Religious Votaries to him. For whereas his Predecessor, who was a Man of a Gentle, Moderate Spirit, and not so Cruel, and Barbarous, as this, had grant∣ed Licences to the Christians to sell Wine, (by which a considerable Revenue arises to the Grand Seignior.) This Vizier to show his Hatred to the Christian Religion, issued out most strict Proclamations against the use of Wine, making it Death, either to Sell, or Buy, or Drink it; which much affected the Hearts of those, who were the most Superstitious, and Hypocritical; and gain∣ed him great Credit in general with the Musselmen, or Mahometan Believers. About the time that the Persian Ambas∣sador made his Entry into Adrianople, and received his Audience of the Grand Seigni∣or, Count Tekeli arrived there also, attend∣ed with 30 Officers of his own Creatures, and Confidents;Tekeli at Adri∣anople. he entered with great State, and Pomp, and was conducted to his Lodging in the Palace of Isaac Efendi, where the greater Honours were shown him by the Instigation of the French Am∣bassador. The Day following being conducted to his Audience with the Grand Vizier, he appeared very Rich and Stately in his Ha∣bit, wearing, after the Hungarian Fashion, a large Plume of Heron's Feathers on his Head, the bottom of which, where they were fixed, being set and studded with Pre∣cious Stones of great Value; he staid a∣bove an Hour in Conference with the Grand Vizier, being treated with Caresses, and Kindness beyond the Manner which is u∣sual amongst Turks:His Audi∣ence with the Grand Vizier. After which he recei∣ved a Coftan lined with Sables, as is given to the greatest Pasha's, and with him 15 of his Officers were also Vested; at this Conference Tekeli advised the Grand Vizier to provide two great Armies, one to act on the Frontiers in Hungary, and the other in Transilvania. The French Ambassa∣dor visits him.After this Audience which Tekeli had with the Grand Vizier, the French Ambas∣sador having first obtained License for the same from the Vizier, made him a Visit; at which the usual Ceremonies passed, with great Protestations of Friendship, and Pro∣mises of Assistance from the King his Ma∣ster. The Turks were very uneasie all this time, during the Abode of the Persian Am∣bassador at the Ottoman Court, least he should discover, as we have said, the Weak∣ness of the Turks in Hungary, and the Com∣motions of the Arabs against the Ottomans; so that every thing was Whispered, and Concealed with all the Secrecy that was possible; and accordingly what Letters came either from Hungary, or the Eastern Parts; they were committed to some of the Renegade Christians to be read, who ha∣ving been Educated in all the Learning of the Seraglio, were capable to Interprer them, and being confined within those Schools, had no means of Conversation with People without the Seraglio. Tekeli,Tekeli and the Tartar dispatched away. and the Tartar Han having fini∣shed their Business at Adrianople, and agreed on all the Methods they were to act for the ensuing Campaign; they were dispatched away, the first towards Hungary, and the other to the Crim. It being now time to prepare and pro∣vide for the War, several Changes and Al∣terations were made amongst the Officers. The Captain Pasha was put out of his Of∣fice,Change of Officers. and the Treasurer of the Grand Seig∣nior's Private Cash, was put in his Place, a Person wholly ignorant of Maritime Af∣fairs, but preferred as an Old Servant, and for his Merits in other Employments; and his Predecessor Missiroglu, who had been always bred up a Seaman at Tripoli in Bar∣bary, was ordered for Hungary; as was al∣so the Chimacam of Constantinople. The Aga, or General of the Janisaries, had also been deprived of his Office; and being a Man of good Esteem amongst the Soldiery, many adhered to his Party, which began to create a strong Faction amongst the Sol∣diery; to prevent the increase of which, many Officers amongst the Janisaries were secretly Strangled in the Night, whereby all those Plots were overthrown which were designed to promote that General of the Janisaries, who had the Esteem for his Courage, and good Conduct, to the Su∣blime Office of Grand Vizier; by which the Christians received a considerable Pre∣judice, he being a Friend to the Peace; and an Enemy to the French. But to keep the Turks fixed, and steddy to the War, the French Ambassador assured the Turks;The French Ambassa∣dor encou∣rages the Turks. That his Master the King had dispatched alrea∣dy from France. 200 Officers expert in the War, who might arrive in very few Days, and that amongst them were some famous Engineers, skilful in throwing Bombs and Granadoes, and making all sorts of Artifi∣cial Fire-works. And moreover he assured them, That every Day he expected two Men of War laden with Bombs, and Arms; and all sorts of Military Instruments, with some Thousands of Muskets to Arm the Janisaries. Moreover this Ambassador of∣fered the Port, in the Name of his Master; to maintain three Regiments of Janisaries; and to Cloath them all in Blew Vests; but
this piece of Generosity looking too mean and disagreeable to the Grandeur of the Turks,March. was refused with some Indignation, and Disdain: Howsoever the French Engi∣neers, upon their Arrival were accepted, and Enrolled amongst the other Gunners; over which, the Master of the Artillery was a Turk. The Spring coming now forward, great Preparations were making both by Sea and Land for the approaching Campaign. At the Arsenal, the new Captain Pasha was very diligent to forward the Naval Preparations; of which twelve great Ma∣hoones,Preparati∣ons for the War. or Galleons, and two new Galle∣asses were preparing, with six new Frigats, besides the Gallies belonging to the Beys of the Archipelago, which are commonly 36 in number. Moreover, great Quantities of Bisket and Ammunition, were prepa∣ring to be sent on Saicks by the Danube for the use of the Army. Nor were the Pre∣parations, and Recruits for the Land Army neglected; for a Door, (as they call it) was opened for making Janisaries; of which they pretended to form for this Year 25000, and to have a greater Army this Year, than they had the last, before the Battle of Salankement, in which the Turks were the more animated, and made to be∣lieve better of their own Condition than it really was, by the Applications which the Christian Ambassadors made to Mediate a Peace;Instances for a Peace promote the War. believing that neither the Empe∣ror, nor the Venetians would press so hard for a Peace, were they able to maintain the War. But what gave some stop to the War∣like Preparations, were the Factions a∣mongst the Turks themselves; by which the Mufti was suspended, and sent into Banishment; and a Pitiful, Decrepit Old Fellow, who had been Imaum, or Chap∣lain to Old Kupriogli, put into his Place, of whom we have given a Character be∣fore, and that he was unconstant in all his Resolutions. The Persian Ambassador still continuing at Adrianople, the Turks knew not in what manner to be rid of him; they wished for his Departure, not so much to save the daily Charge which they bestowed upon him,The Persi∣an Ambas∣sador con∣tinues at Adriano∣ple. as to be quit of a Spy, who looked as if he came to see the Nakedness of the Land. It was not seemly to order him to be gone, but it was thought that he would not stay long after the Horse-Tail was set out, (which is a Sign that the Grand Vi∣zier resolves in 40 Days to take the Field) upon which it was given out, That he was to be at Sophia about the 7th or 8th of May, whence in a few Days he was to pro∣ceed, and to expect the Forces of Asia at Belgrade. In order hereunto all Preparations possi∣ble were made for the War; the Grand Vi∣zier designing to be in the Field before the Christians,Preparati∣ons for the War. several Brigantines were dis∣patched for the Danube by way of the Black-Sea, with Saicks for Asack laden with Am∣munition and Provisions for the War, most of which Vessels were designed up as high as Belgrade. But for all this haste which the Turks made, the Factions amongst themselves retarded their Expeditions, and caused every thing to move slowly. We have already given a Character of the Grand Vizier,Factions in the Court. as a Man infirm both in Body and Mind, and endued with no other Abilities to conserve himself, and his Government, besides a Cruelty na∣tural to him, by which he conserved him∣self by the destruction of others; he had, as we have said, put many of the Chief Officers to Death; and had caused the Muf∣ti to be displaced and banished; he also proceeded so far, as to take the Kuslir Aga from the daily Service of the Sultan; and in despight of his great Power in the Sera∣glio, to send him into Banishment: After which there remained but one Person, of whom he conceived any Fear, or Jealou∣sie, and that was the Chimacam of Adri∣anople; and until he was taken off,The Grand Vizierseeks the Life of the Chi∣macam. he could conceive no Quiet within his own Breast, nor could he think himself secure after his departure to the War, unless he first saw his Competitor under the same Fate with his other Enemies, and his Son placed in his Stead and Office: With these Thoughts this wretched Vizier went bold∣ly to the Sultan to demand license to give the Fatal Blow to the Chimacam, the which recoiled upon himself; for he being much in Favour, and in Esteem with the Grand Seignior for his Prudence and Dexterity in Affairs,He is rui∣ned there∣by. and for the Truth which he had always told him: The Sultan no sooner heard him speak against the Chimacam, but putting himself into a Violent Passion, called immediately for his Band of Black Eunuchs to remove him away out of his Presence, and to strangle him as a Faithless and an Unworthy Minister. But it seems the Eunuchs, contrary to their Natural Temper, taking Compassion of an Aged and Decrepid Person, fell down at the Feet of the Sultan, imploring his Mercy and Commiseration towards an old Servant, whose Years might plead for his Pardon. The Sultan being a Prince of an Easie Temper, hearkened to their Petitions, and causing him to be put into an inward Room for a while, sent immediately to call for the Chimacam to come to him; who all Pale and Wan, fearing least his Enemy the
Vizier had prevailed with the Grand Seig∣nior against his Life, came all Trembling, and cast himself down at the Feet of the Sultan; but he was soon put out of his Fears, by the comfortable Words of the Grand Seignior, declaring him Vizier, and therewith a Vest of Sables was thrown o∣ver him, and the Seals delivered to him. But he being a Person of Prudence,The Ci∣macam re∣fuses to be Vizier. and Experience of the uncertainty of that Su∣blime Office in such a Conjuncture of Time, as was at present; began before the Grand Seignior, much to bewail his hard Fate, which hurried him into an Honour too high and weighty for him to support; de∣claring, That he only desired to live in the Degree of Chimacam, that he might ne∣ver depart from the side of his Lord and Master. With these, and such like Words as these, he moved the Sultan to Compassio∣nate his Case, and to grant his Request: And in his Place was named Halil Pasha,Another Vi∣zier na∣med. at that time Pasha of Diarbekir in Mesopo∣tamia, who had been Chief Chamberlain to Kara Mustapha, when he lay in the Siege before Vienna. To execute this Great Affair, two Aga's were dispatched immediately away by the Post, to bring this Halil Pasha to Adriano∣ple; and in the mean time all the Affairs of the War remained at a stand, which was very strange at such a Season, when the Armies were ready to take the Field; and that all things must give way to the Con∣sideration of a single Man, who was to be fetched at the distance of above 1000 En∣glish Miles from Adrianople; as if no Man could be found like him equal to that great and heavy Charge. In the mean time the Deposed Vizier, was Banished to the Castles of the Darda∣nelli;The Old Vizier Ba∣nished, the which proved not all his Punish∣ment; for his Estate, according to the Cu∣stom of the Turks, was Arrested; 500 Purses of Money, with half a Million of Dollars, were seized for Service of the Sultan,And his Estate sei∣zed. with about 18000 Soltanini, or Gold Ducats, belonging to the Vizier's Son; the Kahya also was put into Prison, of whom nothing more having been heard, it was believed that he had been put to Death. Upon the News hereof the Soldiery at Belgrade Conspired together to present be∣fore the Grand Seignior, Halil Pasha their Seraskier, or General at that time of their Army,The Soldi∣ers at Bel∣grade of∣fer to pre∣fer another, but denied. as the fittest Person for the Office of Grand Vizier, and the most able of any to contend with those great Difficulties, which oppressed the Empire: But in regard that Post was already filled, the Port refu∣sed to hearken thereunto; and least such a Denial should cause any disturbance. Halil Pasha was sent to Negropont, where he for∣merly had shown great Bravery, and good Conduct; and thus all things re∣mained at a stand, until the Arrival of the New Vizior, till which time also the Per∣sian Ambassador could not be dispatched; nor did he hastily desire it, being taken up with Admiration and Pleasure to see so ma∣ny Tragical Changes, and Confusions,The Persi∣an Ambas∣sador plea∣sed here∣with. far different from those Days, when the Otto∣man Union, and absolute uncontrouled Power gave a Terrour to Persia, and all the Eastern World. In the mean time for want of the Grand Vizier all things were at a stand; for the Tartars refused to move until they received Instructions from the New Grand Vizier,All at a stand until the Vizier's coming. and the Asiatick Troops which were upon their March at this time, and ready to pass into Europe, retarded, and slackned their Pace, until they knew what new Orders this Vizier would give them. Howsoever the Officers both of Horse and Foot, which were already in Europe, were hastned on their March with all speed, that at the Ar∣rival of the Grand Vizier, the whole Ar∣my might be found in a good posture on the Frontiers near Belgrade: And the Pre∣parations for the Sea in the mean time went forward with all Chearfulness, it be∣ing designed, that the Maritime Force should be equal to that of the last Year, being reinforced with many Vessels from Tripoli, Tunis, and Algier; in all which Expeditions the Chimacam of Adrianople was very vigilant and active. At length, about the beginning of May, the Grand Vizier arrived at Adrianople, near which Place he was met at Hafsa, a∣bout three Hours distant from thence, by many of the Principal Officers,The Vizier arrives, and recei∣ved by the Grand Seignior. and at an Hours distance from the City, by the Mufti, and Chimacam, and others; who in great Pomp and State conducted him to the Presence of the Sultan, by whom he was graciously received, and the Seals de∣livered to his Hand; after which being Vested with a Coftan lined with Sables, he made a short Prayer, and withdrew him∣self from the Presence of the Sultan, and being come to the Vizier's Palace, he be∣stowed Coftans on all the Pasha's, and Of∣ficers of his Court, confirming the Old Ones in their Places, and declaring New where they were vacant. Having taken some Refreshment that Night, the next Day he held a Solemn Council, at which it was concluded, what Methods were to be taken, for the future;A Counsel of War, May 1692. and it was agreed, That on the 31st of this Month the Vizier's Tents were to be pitch∣ed at the usual Place without the City; and
also the Janisar-Aga's; and that the Day following they were both in Person to March out into their Tents; and that on the 6th of June they were to begin their Journey towards Belgrade;The Vizier marches to∣wards Bel∣grade. accordingly the Janisaries led the Van, as was usual, and proceeded a Day before the Vizier, and the Spahee's; but they had not march∣ed a Day before that being united with the other Militia, they began to Mutiny, ex∣claiming for their Pay, and protesting that they would not proceed until first they had received their six Months Pay in Arrear,The Jani∣saries mu∣tiny for Pay, with their Vests of thick Cloth, as also the Donative due to them at the Inaugura∣tion of every New Sultan: To content these People, the Grand Vizier issued out to them with all speed their six Months Pay; and with fair Words and Promises, he so pacified them,Are paci∣fied. that they quietly marched forward to Belgrade, protesting howsoever, not to pass the Save without their Cloth and Donative. With this Pacification the Grand Vizier taking a little Breath, began to consider of the manner how to establish himself; and because an Able, and Faithful Chimacam, who remains near the Person of the Grand Seignior, is always a great support to a Vizier, he sent for the Pasha of Aleppo, named Mustapha, to come to him, who in the Time of Solyman the Grand Vizier, had been Seraskier, or General against the Poles: This Person being come to him, he made him Chimacam,A New Chimacam made. and displaced the o∣ther (who, as we have said, refused late∣ly the Vizier's Office) and sent him to re∣main Pasha at Erzirum, which is in Arme∣nia Major. One would have imagined that this Vi∣zier might have thought himself secure with that Chimacam, who had refused, (as we have said) the Vizier's Office, so fairly and so lately offered to him by the Sultan, so that a little kind Aspect, and few oblig∣ing Words might have made him entirely his own; but there is a Fate amongst the Turks, that neither the Grand Seignior is constant to his Viziers, and Chief Officers, nor they to the Inferiour Ministers, who act under them, never believing them∣selves secure, but with those who are their own Creatures, by which continual Revo∣lutions all things remain in distraction, and a Vizier hath scarce learned, or become Master of his Trade, before he is disgra∣ced, and thrown down from his Sublime Office, with all his Kindred and Dependan∣ces, to the Abyss of Misery, and Ruine, of which we have discoursed at large in a∣nother Treatise. Upon which Maxime this Vizier called for his own Creature to make him Chima∣cam, and recalled the late Mufti, whom the preceding Vizier had Exiled,The Mufti recalled. which was the more easily done, the Place being vacant by the Death of the Mufti who was last made. All these Embroils and Changes could not do less than hinder the Proceed∣ings of the main Business; for the Budzi∣ack Tartar refusing to follow the Com∣mand of the Tartar Han, the Grand Seig∣nior sent one Messenger after the other to hasten the March of the Tartars, command∣ing them with 3 or 4000 Horse to carry on each a Sack of Wheat, or Meal, for the Relief of Great Waradin,Waradin in great distress. from whence frequent Letters came, that they being re∣duced to the Extremity of Famine, could not longer subsist, but should be forced to deliver themselves up into the Hands of the Enemy, unless speedily succoured. In this manner unthought of Accidents fell out full of Disappointments, by which neither the Forces at Land, nor at Sea a∣mounted to half the Power they were of the last Year. Thus far in this Year of 1692, have we shown the State of Affairs in Turky, whilst at Vienna things were in preparation for the following Campaign, and many Coun∣sels of War were held by the General Of∣ficers, in Presence, and with the Assistance of Prince Lewis of Baden. We being now in the Month of May,May. all the Endeavours were bent for taking Great Waradin before the Turkish Army should take the Field, and come to relieve it, of which there was now no great probability, in regard that from all sides Advices came, that the Town laboured under the last Ex∣tremity of Famine; the which was not on∣ly confirmed by Letters from thence to A∣drianople; but by a Messenger dispatched with Letters to Giula and Temeswaer from the Besieged, to give an account of the miserable Condition of the Place, the Cir∣cumstances of which were reported to be so wretched, that in all probability the Place could not hold out much longer. But because many times Reports are false, and that Men do often, especially in War, magnifie, or diminish things accord∣ing to their Humour or Interest; it was judged fit not to expect until Famine had forced the Besieged to surrender, for that might prove still the Work of some Months, and in the mean time give the Enemy means to relieve the Place; wherefore it was resolved to force the Surrender, and the care thereof being committed to Gene∣ral Heusler, he with all Expedition and Diligence having drawn his Troops toge∣ther from their Winter-Quarters, and ad∣jacent Places, posted himself near the Old
Fort, in which the Heydukes had kept a Garrison during the Winter Season, from whence he sent a Summons to the Turks to Surrender,Heusler Summon's the Town. They refuse to yield. and deliver up the City; which they resolutely refusing to do, he began the Day following to open the Trenches, and raised two Bulwarks exactly opposite to the Bulwarks of the Enemies, called Zingar, and Capudon; and caused a Bridge to be laid from the Palancha Oloschi, reach∣ing to the Old City. To disturb these Works, the Turks plyed their Great Guns continually, and made a furious Sally, but were repulsed with some loss. In like man∣ner also the Besiegets drew another Line on the other side of the River,The Turks make Sal∣lies, and are repul∣sed. so that the Town was now environed on every side, and the Christians lodged at the Ditch of the City. On the 7th the Turks made another Sal∣ly, but were repulsed: And on the 8th, made another, with much more Bravery than they had done the Day before, but were repulsed with like Loss: Upon which the Janisaries went to the Pasha to consult with him what was to be done in this present Exigency; and all agreed, To hold out some Days longer in expectation of the promised Relief; during which time, both sides employed themselves to ply their Cannon, and throw their Bombs incessantly. On the 11th some Hundreds of the Be∣sieged shew'd themselves without the For∣tress, but withdrew without farther At∣tempt; on which Day 11 Heydukes were killed, and 15 wounded. On the 13th the Turks made another Sally on the Heydukes, but were briskly received, and soon repulsed. The 16th, 17th, and 19th, little or no∣thing of moment was done, by reason of the continual Rains; but by this time the more heavy Cannon being come, the Breach was made wider and larger; so that Gene∣ral Heusler supposing that the Enemy might be terrified thereby,Continue resolute to maintain the Town. he sent a Trumpeter to make them the last Summons, threat∣ning them in Default thereof, to give no Quarter either to Man, Woman, or Child; but as yet the Turks showed no fear of the Menaces pronounced against them; and an Old, Grave Turk showing himself on the Walls, called to the Besiegers, and admo∣nished them to withdraw their Troops from under the Walls of the City, which they should never take, the Besieged being re∣solved to Live and Die together in the same. This declared Resolution of the Turks, quickned the Operations of the Ge∣neral, so that throwing Fire into the Town, and plying the great Guns continually Day and Night, the Breach was made much wi∣der than it had been some few Days before, and ready for Storm, which was designed for the 28th of the Month: The Turks see∣ing the Troops in a readiness for an At∣tack, their Hearts began to fall; and there∣upon a White Flag was displayed,Howsoever they Capi∣tulate. and five Deputies were sent to the Army to treat, and Hostages being given on both sides, these Articles were agreed on, and an Instrument drawn up in this Form fol∣lowing. The Pasha of Waradin, His Address to the Emperor. MOST Happy Caesar, Emperor of the Romans, in whom resides the Heighth of Majesty, Honour, and Glory, and of highest Esteem amongst the Christian Princes; We the Soldiers and Musselmen of Waradin, ha∣ving been streightned and oppressed by a long and tedious Siege, and being at last reduced to the last Extremities by your Imperial Ar∣my Encamped against us, and being not able longer to hold out, do cast our selves at the Happy Feet of the Imperial Majesty: And being at length constrained to yield unto Fate, and Destiny, we fly unto your Clemency, and most Pious Benignity, which is a Ray, or Ema∣nation from the Most Sublime Creator; decla∣ring that voluntarily, and of our own proper Motions, (since God will have it so) to save our Lives, we have Pawned and Surrendered this our Fortress, with all the Ammunition therein; that is, Cannon, Muskets, and o∣ther Arms, and Military Instruments, to your Commissary, the Most Honourable, and Most Excellent Heusler.

Given the 20th of the Moon, called Ra∣mazan, in the Hegeira 1103; which is the 3d of June 1692. Seifullah Cadi di Varadin. Abdulatif Pasha and Chief Governour of Waradin. Ibrahim Pasha, the late pre∣ceeding Governor of Wa∣radin. Osman Agha. An Inventory of what was found in the Fortress. FIve Thousand Measures of Barley. 1000 Measures of Wheat. 300 Sacks of Rice. 50 Fats of Flour. 50 Brass Guns, most of which were German. 22 Mortars. 70000 Pounds of good Powder: And 723000 of old decayed Powder. 3500 Cannon Bullets. 30000 Pounds of Iron: And 4300 Pounds of Wrought Iron. The Articles being thus signed on the 3d of June,June. the Day following the Bridge was repaired, and the Turks marched out of the Fortress, to the Number of about 1200 Fighting Men, and in all 12000 Souls,The Turks march out of Wara∣din. which were ranged in good Order on a convenient Ground without the Town, where they remained until the German and Rascian Militia, which was in Garrison in
Pescabara was released, and which the Turks had detained there contrary to the Capitu∣lations. And thus ended the Siege of this Impor∣tant Place, the Conquest of which served much towards the Security of Transilvania to the Emperor. The Turks being desirous of a Revenge, detached a strong Party from Belgrade to∣wards Esseck,June. intending by that way to make an Incursion into Sclavonia; but the Rascians having notice of this March, At∣tacked them at Unawares,The Turks repulsed by the Rasci∣ans from Titul and Titz. and cut down 200 of them, and took 40 Prisoners. Ano∣ther Party of Turks also embarking at the same time on three large Boats, fortified with divers Guns, with which approaching near Titul, wherein was a strong Garrison of Rascians, they defended the same wi h so much Courage, that many Turks being Killed and Wounded, they were forced to quit the Design, and return back with Dis∣grace, and some Loss; and in the Town, the Captain of the Rascians was killed, with about 20 Men. Nor better Success had the Turks on Titz, which was defended by a Garrison of 1200: The Turks Embarking them∣selves on 50 Ships, made a furious Assault thereon, which lasted for several Hours; but they were so well received, that they were repulsed, and forced to retire with the loss of some Hundreds Killed, and 30 Prisoners taken. The Croats had still better Success upon the Turks on the other side the River Un∣na, which Country they had often Inva∣ded; and particularly about the beginning of July the Governour of Novi advancing with 3 or 400 Horse as far as Behatz;The Croats take Be∣hatz from the Turks. the Suburbs whereof they Attacked with the Sword in their Hands, Entered and Plun∣dered, and then Burnt the Place; putting all to the Sword, except about 20 Persons of Quality whom he made Prisoners; be∣sides other Booty he took 100 Head of great, and 500 of smaller Cattle. After this Action the same Troops At∣tacked Ostrosatz on two sides, and to∣tally destroyed it, notwithstanding the vi∣gorous Resistance which the Turks had made. About this time also a violent Storm cast away 35 Turkish Barks on the Danube laden with Corn, Flour, Rice, and other Provisions, and did much other Damage by Thunder and Lightning. Such small Matters as these passed, be∣fore the Vizier was in a capacity to take the Field;The Turks in confusion by changes. nothing went well at Home, nor prosperous Abroad. For after the Vi∣zier had changed the Chimacam, he sent to call a certain Person named Mustapha Pa∣sha, who had continued for a long time Seraskier at Baba in the War against the Poles; and being a Person of great Expe∣rience, and good Conduct in Civil, as well as in Military Affairs, the Vizier judged him the more proper for this Office, by which it was greatly in his Power to do him Services with the Grand Seignior du∣ring his Absence at any time from the Per∣son of the Sultan; and of such a Faithful Friend as this, the Vizier had more than ordinary occasion at a time when he had lately discovered a New Faction Combin∣ing against him, which being necessary to be suppressed before he marched into the Field,Conspiracy against the Vizier. or withdrew himself from the Pre∣sence of the Sultan, he seized on the Prin∣cipal Conspirators against him; namely, the Chimacam, and the Aga or General of the Janisaries, and tho' he was then in a rea∣diness to begin his March, yet he Arrested him, and deprived him of his Office, pla∣cing in the same Imael Pasha, who had lately been Chimacam of Constantinople, and before that time had been made a Pri∣soner by General enevolt; and from his Youth having been always Educated in great Places, he was esteemed the more ca∣pable of any Employment: in this Secret Plot, the Teferdar or Lord High Treasu∣rer, was one of the Conspirators, whom the Vizier also deprived of his Charge▪ with divers others of principal Note; but what most sensibly touched him, was the Disobedience of the Janisaries, which is al∣ways the Fore-runner of Misfortunes to Great Men; the Apprehension of which cast the Vizier into an Indisposition of Bo∣dy, which continued upon him for three Days, but afterwards recollecting himself, and taking Courage, he raised up his Spi∣rits, and in a handsome manner appeaed the Janisaries; howsoever he lived in a continual fear of their Mutinies at Bel∣grade, having rendered himself Odious to the Soldiery and others, by his Unsatiable Avarice, which he had learned from the Principles and Methods of his Old Master Kara Mustapha, by which Vice he had sud∣denly fallen, had he not been supported by his Creature, Ismael Pasha the Chimacam, whom he had raised to that Dignity. Had it not been for these,July. and the like Rubs and Confusions, the Turkish Army would have been before this time in the Field, tho' not so strong perhaps as the last Year; for the Asiatick Militia came slowly in, and those in small Numbers; The Grand Vizier marched not with more than 10000 Men from Adrianople, and the Albanians (the best of their Soldiery) were sent to Negropont to guard that Island, upon a Report, That the Venetians had another Design on that Coast. Another Detach∣ment
was also made of certain Pasha's, with some Tartars to the Number of 6000, who were under one of their Sultans ap∣pointed to drive the Poles out of Moldavia, and regain the Places which they possessed, and amongst these, the late Janisar-Aga, who was dispossessed of his Office, was made Seraskier, or General of those For∣ces. During this Weak Estate and Con∣dition of the Turks, an Unhappy Misfor∣tune befel the Turkish Fleet, which lay in Nicopolis, and Widin, where 35 great Boats laden with Wheat, and Flour for the Army, were cast away by Storm. The Persian Ambassador, who had con∣tinued longer at Adrianople, than the Turks desired, it being neither consistent with their Policy, nor their Riches, to enter∣tain a Guest, whose Business was chiefly to discover the Decay,The Persi∣an Am∣bassador takes his Conge of the Grand Seigior. and Nakedness of their Country, did now about the end of this Month of June begin to think it time to return unto his Master, being well enough informed, as he imagined, of the true E∣state of the Turkish Affairs; received his Audience of Congé from the Sultan pri∣vately in a Garden, where the Imperial Letters were delivered, and the Capitulati∣ons mutually exchanged; and a Present made to him of a Horse richly adorned with Royal Caparisons. These and such like Troubles retarded the Grand Vizer's March towards Belgrade; by which Disappointments the Marquis of Lorand had the Fortune to arrive timely at Constantinople,The Mar∣quis of Lorand, arrives from France. and to Disembark secretly, or incognito, from a Tartana, and thence in a Day or two he proceeded to Adrianople, with the Equipage of a Trumpeter, and 10 Servants, all richly cloathed, and his Table nobly furnished with Plate. In few Days after his Arrival, he received his Audience of the Grand Vizier in Compa∣ny with Monsieur de Chateau-neuf, the pre∣sent residing Ambassador, at which (accord∣ing to the usual Custom of the French at all their Audiences) their Business was to extol the Greatness and Power of their Ma∣ster; and to report unto the Turks, That their King had furnished King James with a Mighty Fleet,His Reports made to the Turkish Court. and 30000 Men to Invade England, which were all ready at the time of his Departure to Embark, and consisted with Men of War, and Transport Ships of more than 600 Sail; the which joyning in England with the contrary Party to that which then Governed; would no doubt carry all before them in that Country, and consequently cause great Confusions in Holland, and amongst all the Allies. Moreover that his King was ready to enter into the Field in Person, with a most formidable Army, (as he had promised the Sultan) against the Emperor, of the Success of which they would speedily hear ftom their fortunate King who had ever been Prosperous in all his Enterprises: Moreover he added, That all these great things the King had done, were to sup∣port the Ottoman Empire, which would certainly have been staggering under that Mighty Power of the Allies, had it not been supported by the French, and their Forces diverted from the Ottoman Domini∣ons in Hungary;The Vizier promises to continue the War. all which the Grand Vi∣zier heard with Pleasure and Attention, as∣suring the Marquis, and the Ambassador, that he never had any Design, or Imagi∣nation of making a Peace with the Empe∣ror, without the Concurrence of the French. Howsoever the Marquis not knowing how constant and firm to their Resolutions the Turks might be, in case that things should succeed ill in the Turkish Army, or that the Imperialists should take Belgrade;The Mar∣quis per∣mitted to go to Bel∣grade. he ob∣tained Licence from the Vizier to accompa∣ny him to the War, during this Campaign, where he might be ready at hand to oppose all Proposals tending to a Peace, in case a∣ny Endeavours should be made therein. And in this manner the Grand Vizier de∣parted the 30th of June from Adrianople, towards Belgrade; having pointed out 32 Days March from one Place to the other, besides Days of Otorack, or Days of Re∣pose. But before the Vizier's Departure, two Mirzes, or Tartarian Noblemen, with six other Tartars, arrived at Adrianople, bring∣ing News, That Batter Gherei, one of the Sultan Tartars, had entered into Volhinia a Province belonging to Poland, and had car∣ried away Captive above 30000 Souls;Reports from the Tartars. which Rumour was spread abroad to en∣courage the Turks, when in truth there were not above 2000 taken; and farther to give Life to the Soldiery, it was report∣ed, That Adil Gherei the Younger Brother was remaining within the Confines of Va∣lachia, attending his Elder Brother, that they might with a joynt force March into Hungary. Howsoever to secure the Tartars, the Grand Vizier before his Departure from Adrianople dispatched away three Capugi-Bashees, with pressing Commands to the Han of Budziack, to march with all speed to Belgrade, and not to delay their time as they had done the last Year, and that they should have a care not to deceive him, for that he depended much on their Forces; but herein the Vizier was not well infor∣med, for the Budziack Tartar could not furnish more than 3000 Men; and as to the Noghai Tartar, they were Numerous; but withal, they were such a sort of Salvage
Creatures, Rebellious, and Disgusted by the Turks;July. that no great account could be made of them. Nor yet of Sultan Galgha Prince of Crim Tartary, who was engaged in a War against the Cossacks, and had e∣nough to do to defend himself against such a Stout and an Active Enemy. Moreover to make the Assistance of the Tartars the less considerable this Year, the Tartars re∣belled against their New Han, in their March towards Belgrade: At first this Mu∣tiny appeared only in some Dislikes, which the Principal Tartars showed against their New Sultan, the which daily increasing, came to such a heighth, that the whole Ar∣my forsook and left him, and returned in a Body back to Budziack, and were fol∣lowed soon after by the Han himself, with some of his Menial Servants; the News hereof being brought to the Grand Seig∣nior, and Grand Vizier, they knew not how to carry on the War for this Year; so that all the Remedy which remained, was to re-establish the Old Han, Selim Gherey, in his Place; the which tho' it pleased the Sol∣diers better, yet by this time the Season was so far spent, that nothing of moment could be expected to be put in Action for that Year. Some small Matters indeed the Turks did attempt, but always with loss; in July they Attacked a small, but a strong Fortress, called Portsea, near Peter-Wara∣din; the which was so well defended by a Garrison of Rascians, that the Turks were several times repulsed;The Turks repulsed from Port∣sea. and at last hearing that some Imperial Heydukes, and Dragoons, had passed the Save, and had cut down great Numbers of Turks, they quitted their design on Portsea, and returned back to Belgrade: Howsoever upon better con∣sideration, concluding that the Place was of so high importance, that they might be called into question for quitting the Siege, they returned back again, and on the 5th of August made another Attack upon the Place, and resolved to carry it by force of Arms; but News coming, That a strong Body of the Imperial Troops were sent to relieve the Place, and were already in their March, they quitted the Siege; and be∣ing Attacked in the Rear, they left many Dead and Wounded Men behind them. The Ban of Croatia Attacks the Turks.About the same time the Vice-Ban, or Lieutenant-General of Croatia, having got together a strong Body of 5500 Croats and Rascians, made an Incursion towards Mey∣dan, in which Expedition, he not only had the good fortune to release 400 Poor Christians, who were Condemned to Die, and should have been executed the next Day (had they not been seasonably relieved by the Croatians) but to return back with a considerable Booty of Cattle, and Move∣ables, together, with some principal Turks of Quality and Note,August. whole Houses and stately Buildings they Burnt and Destroyed little or nothing more remarkable farther passed all this Campaign, unless it were a Matter of two considerable Convoys sent to Temeswaer, the latter of which consisted of several Thousands of Turks, conducting 100 Waggons and many Camels laden with all necessary Provisions; and so ha∣ving provided the Town for the whole Winter, they returned back to Belgrade. At the same time a Body of Rascians broke into the Morava,The Rasci∣ans take great Boe∣ties. and there attacked and beat another Turkish Convoy, which carri∣ed 200000 Dollars to the Turkish Army, which was a brave Booty for the Rascians; for tho' the Grand Vizier upon the News thereof, had Detached a Body of 10000 Ar∣nauts after them, yet the Prey had given them Wings, and they escaped safe into their Towns and Garrisons of Refuge. Some later Actions passed besides, but none of great consequence, expecting that the Turks having a mind to look big, and put a good Face on it towards the latter end of the Campaign, passed the Save, to recognize the Imperial Camp at Salanke∣ment; but so soon as the News thereof was brought to the General, a strong Party of Heydukes and Imperial Dragoons, were De∣tached to meet them; at the noise of which the Turks Retired, and therewith the Campaign ended in Hungary: For the Ja∣nisaries being debased in their Courages by the ill Success of the last Year, refused to return into the Field, complaining of the Cowardice of the Spahees, by whom they had been exposed in open Field, and given up to the Fury of the Enemy, whilst the Spahees fled, and saved themselves in Belgrade; and the Tartars not returning to the War, gave the Janisaries just cause to put an end more early than was accustoma∣ry, to this Years Campaign; who accord∣ing to the Military Constitutions of the Ottoman Empire, may be obliged to conti∣nue in the Field until the 28th of October,The Cam∣paign of the Year 169 ends. but not longer; for in such case, if not pro∣vided with Winter-Quarters by that Day, the Janisaries may leave the Camp, against the Will and Command of their Generals, and shift for themselves. Tho' the Campaign was ended in Hun∣gary, yet something of Action continued in Poland, where on the 27th of September, the Turks Attacked a Fortress called Soroka with an Army of 30000 Men, Command∣ed by the Seraskier Mustapha Pasha;Poland. the same consisting of 8000 Turks, 2000 un∣der the Pasha of Silistria, 6000 under the Hospodar of Valachia, 2000 under the Ge∣neral of the Cossacks, with 12000 Tartars:
With this Army, (as we say) Mustapha Pasha Invested this small Fortress, which was defended by a Garrison of 600 Men, with most of which, the Governour made a Sally on the same Day that the Enemy came before it, and killed about 80 of the Besiegers, and so returned to the Fort, ha∣ving first burnt the Suburbs, to prevent the Enemy from taking Shelter therein. So inconsiderable a Fort as this, which might have been taken by this Powerful Army with open Breasts without the Methods of Trenches and Approaches,The Turks vigorously Attack So∣oka. was now Invest∣ed with all the Formalities of a Siege: For the first Night the Turks began their Trenches, and to throw Bombs into the Place, and to raise a Battery of Great Guns, which they plyed for three or four Days and Nights continually. On the 1st of October they advanced their Trenches to the Ditch-side; the which having filled up, they stormed the Fortress, but were repulsed with the loss of 600 Men; notwithstanding which, they made a second Attempt, and entered the City, and Burnt it; but being again beaten out of it, they continued the following Day to Fire without ceasing for the space of three or four Days;Is well de∣fended. by which time, tho' great Breaches were made, yet the Besieg∣ed with indefatigable Industry repaired in the Night, what the Enemies had ruined in the Day. On the 5th and 6th the Turks took Post in the Ditch, and endeavoured to fortifie themselves there; but the Besieged Sally∣ing out, dislodged them from thence, the Turks howsoever recruiting themselves with fresh Forces, recovered their Post; and having drained out all the Water from the Ditch, they encompassed the Fortress round on all sides, throwing thereinto Bombs, Carcasses, Stink-Pots, and other Artificial Fires: But neither these, nor Batteries availing to terrifie the Besieged, the Turks applied themselves to sink Mines; which the Besieged having disco∣vered, made some of them useless by Countermines; howsoever the Turks in∣tending to Storm the Place on the 9th of that Month, fired one of their Mines ear∣ly that Morning, which threw down part of the Wall, and immediately they began to Storm the Place,October. which the Besieged withstood for four Hours together, dri∣ving the Turks from the Walls, as often as they advanced, and planted their Colours thereupon. In this Action the Besieged took three Standards,The Turks repulsed. and killed 800 of the Enemy; and prosecuting this Success, they drove them out of most of their Posts and Lodgments, with the loss of 1000 of their Men; and having gained six Ensigns, they returned with Joy and Triumph to their Fortress.October. This Vigorous Defence so astonished the Turks, and caused them to despair of ta∣king the Fortress; that silently in the Night they raised their Camp with so much Precipitation,Raise the Siege. that they left behind them two Great Guns, and three Mortar-pieces, with much Ammunition and Provisions. The next Morning being the 11th of the Month, the Besieged Sallying out, found no Enemy near them: The Action was very strange, and almost Miraculous, considering that the Turks had lost more than 4000 Men, and the Christians had 150 Killed, and 120 Wounded; the Turks had an Army of 30000 Men to oppugne the Castle, and the Christians no more than 600 to defend it: And with this Action the Campaign ended, as well in Poland, as in Hungary. After the Death of Sir William Hussey, who Died, as we have said, the last Year at Belgrade; William King of England, &c. immediately dispatched away Mr. Herbert, in Quality of Ambassador to the Grand Seignior, with Orders to reassume the Mediation of Peace between the Emperor, and his Allies, with the Sultan, and not to lose the present Opportunity, which looked favourable in regard to both sides. Mr. Herbert had very little time given him to provide himself for so great an Un∣dertaking and Journey over Land;Mr. Her∣bert sent Ambassa∣dor to the Turks. and tho' he was often afflicted with the Gout, and not very well at ease, when he begun so long a Journey, yet being a Man of a great Spirit, he forced himself, that he might not lose the Merit and Honour of being the Instrument of procuring that Peace between the Emperor, and the Sul∣tan, in which all Europe was concerned: the Turks being then very low, and much debased in their Spirits, seemed flexible and inclinable to a Peace: And not to lose this favourable Conjuncture, the Journey of Mr. Herbert was pressed with all the haste imaginable; but what with the Fa∣tigue of the Journey, and the Unquietness of his Mind for being obstructed in a Ne∣gotiation so much desired by him, he be∣came so violently Attacked by the Gout, that he was forced to yield unto his Di∣stemper, and lay himself up for some Months at Frankfort, so that it was March before his Arrival at Vienna, and far in the Month of April before his Departure from thence; during which time I received two Letters from him,Mr. Her∣bert's Let∣ters to the Author. the chief substance of which was to complain of his want of Health, and of the little appearance of a
Peace between the Emperor and the Turks; they despising (as he said) all the Over∣tures that had been made to them, which had served only to exalt the French Am∣bassador, and to keep the Turks from a Peace, who imagined that such Instances would never have been made for Peace, had the Christians not been droven to Ex∣tremities and want of Power to support and continue a War: Howsoever Mr. Her∣bert, in Obedience to His Majesty's Com∣mands, resolved to proceed, and try his Fortune; and being furnished by the Em∣peror, the Venetians, and the King of Po∣land, with their Conditions respectively, on the which they were contented to esta∣blish the Foundation of Peace, he took his way down the Danube, which was the most convenient Passage for a Person la∣bouring under his Distemper: And on this occasion, I have thought fit to Insert the Propositions offered from the Allies unto the Turks, which are these which follow. PROPOSITIONS For a Lasting PEACE, Offer'd at the Sublime Port, by Mr. Herbert, the English Ambassador, 1692. Propositions Offered by the Emperor. In Nomine Dei.

Multum hic morati sumus, qua de cau∣sa, nescimus, jam veris tempus adventat, in Negotio Tractatûs & Conclusionis de Pace multae difficultates oboriantur, quae menti obversari non poterant: Pro eno∣dandis omnibus difficultatibus, reque-sta∣bilienda quies ab armis esse necessaria vi∣deri coepit, ne interrumpatur almi & Sa∣crosancti istius negotii continuatio, armi∣stitii necessitas apparet, pro quo honestum & conveniens temporis spatium praesigen∣dum occurrit.

Sacra Caesarea & Regia Maje∣stas Dominus noster Clementissi∣mus, ut sincero affectu & magno aestimio Serenissimi & Potentissimi Magnae Britanniae Regis & Prae∣potentium Dominorum Generali∣um Ordinum Foederati Belgij ad promovendam pacem cum Porta Ottomannica officia sibi oblata acceptat, ita quemadmodum sum∣mâ etiam in fortuna, & geminatis victoriis pacem honestam & tu∣tam aequis conditionibus inire de∣sideravit & etiamnum inire para∣ta est; Nos jussit Excellentissi∣mum Dominum Legatum Angliae ad Portam Ottomannam profici∣scentem super hoc negotio Pacis Viennae jam inchoato, de ejusdem processu, & ubi haerere coeperit, plene informare, simulque ejusdem Caesaream mentem circa ea quae adhuc facienda restant, ut Pax in∣tentata coalescere possit adaperire. VENERUNT huc Turcae pacem offerentes circa finem anni millesimi sexcentesimi octuagesimi octavi, quae tum proposuerint, propositio Caesareis Commissariis ad hoc negotium deputatis, ab ipsis Ablegatis Turcicis tradita, hic sub A. apposita fusius demonstrabit, sic  etiam, quae ad hanc Propositionem Caesa∣rei Commissarii responderint, contra-pro∣positio B. exhibebit; Verum cum Propo∣sitio  Turcica interdicto Uti Possidetis fun∣daretur; sed intermixtis Territoriis Pax solida, vel armistitium durabile non vide∣retur posse coalescere: Ideo simpliciter à Caesareis Commissariis ad negotium Pacis deputatis acceptari non potuit; ne tamen proptereà mox sub ipso ingressu tractatus Pacis abrumperetur, urserunt praedicti Caesarei Commissarii, ut locorum respe∣ctivè cedendorum & retinendorum singu∣lorum discussio individualis iniretur; ve∣rùm cum hoc ab Ablegatis Turcicis impe∣trari non posset & hi desuper mittendum Cursorem, ad reportanda mandata à Porta Ottomannica primùm constanter recusa∣rent, post ultrò peterent, expedito Cur∣sore Turcico & reduce, expectabatur quae∣nam mandata desuper Ablegati Turcici ac∣cepissent, & proposituri essent; cùm verò nulla nova praeter proposita se accepisse contestarentur, visum fuit illos dimittere; priusquam verò actualiter Viennâ disce∣derint, primùm specie secreti Eminentissi∣mo Domino Cardinali à Kollonitsch Pro∣positionem suam posteriorem adaperue∣runt,
eamque Domino à Werdenburg po∣steà dictatam & Turcico idiomate compo∣sitam exhibuerunt, & sponte ad singula ce∣denda vel retinenda specificè devenerunt, juxta eandem propositionem illorum po∣steriorem Excellentissimo Domino Legato  Angliae sub C, communicatam. Et quia haec Propositio Turcica posterior genera∣lem dictorum locorum cedendorum vel retinendorum continet specificationem, omnia verò de locorum appertinentiis, formâ ac modo cedendi reticet, certum est, & hanc ipsam Propositionem ulterio∣rem singulorum discussionem requirere: Super quo cùm sufficiens tractandi mate∣ria restaret, ad facilitandam dicti tracta∣tus reassumptionem cum Turcis, post fa∣ctam praedictae Propositionis Turcicae Foe∣deratis communicationem & expectata de∣super eorum sensa, Caesarei Commissarii, revocatis ad hunc finem Pottendorffium saepe dictis Ablegatis Turcicis, responsum suum ad latus dictae Propositionis Turcicae sub nominato C. scripto exhibuerunt: Quod responsum saepe memorati Ablegati Turcici eo praetextu quod nihil novi in se contineret, & tam prima quam posterior eorum Propositio olim exhibita, mutatâ interim rerum facie evanuisset & sibi nul∣la amplius tractandi & concludendi tracta∣tûs facultas superesset, acceptare recusa∣runt; reprehensi postea desuper se re∣sponsum Caesareum suscepturos, absque tamen eo quod & illi desuper iterum re∣sponderent, se offerre; praeteritum verò errorem per id excusare coeperunt, quod gravius sibi visum fuerit, acceptare Cae∣sareum responsum, & ad id non replicare, quam deficiente sibi tractandi facultate il∣lius acceptionem ab initio statim depre∣cari. Quoniam verò rebus his in circum∣stantiis positis, duo indispensabiliter ne∣cessaria se produnt; Primùm, quod si pa∣cem Turcae Practicabilem velint, utrique imperio tutam & honestam, necessariò distinctis limitibus utriusque Imperii Do∣minia ab invicem separari & distingui de∣beant; quare intermixtis Territoriis, nec Pacem nec armistitium tutè & honestè co∣alescere posse, pro infallibili axiomate statuendum & observandum est: Alte∣rum, quod ut ad distinctionem confinio∣rum realem & solidam deveniri possit, praecisè requiratur, ut Porta Ottomannica congruis mandatis & ad facultatem tract∣andi & concludendi idoneis Ablegatos suos hic degentes instruat, juxta quae illi hinc inde respectivè cedendorum, retinendo∣rum, vel permutandorum discussionem, modum cedendi vel appertinentias singu∣lorum definire, & sic concordatis utrinque placitis conditionibus, Pacis vel armistitii tractatus inire, & cum fructu prosequi ac concludere possint. Ad hunc ergò obti∣nendae novae instructionis & facultatis pro saepe dictis Ablegatis Turcicis scopum, summa Negotiationis Excellentissimo Do∣mino Legato Angliae creditae dirigenda, eoque omni possibili conatu allaborandum est, ut facultatem super praefata ultima Caesarea Propositione tractandi Ablegatis Turcicis à Porta Ottomannica mittêndam obtineat, nec inde facile recedendum, cum non sit in promptu, omnia materialia, quae his Generalibus continentur, de loco ad locum specificare & Excellentissimo Do∣mino Legato Angliae suggerere, multa enim ab oculari situationum inspectione dependent, de quibus haud aliter transigi poterit; Et hoc ad Articulum Primum & Secundum Caesarei ultimi responsi. Ad Tertium Art. Nihil Caesareae Pro∣positioni addendum vel demendum venit, eò quod distinctio Confiniorum Caesarei Dominii ab Ottomannico ibidem clarè ex∣posita habetur: Multis in contrarium fa∣cientibus argumentis & rationibus amore Pacis sepositis: Et ea propter in favorem Portae Ottomannicae admissa. Ad Quartum Art. Caesarei responsi de tractu Valachiae & Moldaviae nihil habe∣tur in Caesareo responso; non equidem proptereà quod ad praedictum tractum jus fundatum desit, sed quod nec novis tricis pacis negotium involvere, nec Foederato∣rum cuipiam in eo praejudicare visum fu∣erit. Ad Art. Quintum. Transylvaniae Ne∣gotium omni dubio procul erit in tracta∣tu Petra Scandali, ad quam Jure Avito ad Regnum Hungariae spectantem Armis Caesareis, suffragante spontanea Magna∣tum & Populi submissione, occupatam & possessam, Turcis cedendam,The great∣est difficul∣ty in all this Treaty was this 5th Arti∣cle about Transyl∣vania. nihil est quod Sacram Caesaream Majestatem compellere queat, nec faciet unquam; Ut tamen per∣ficiendae pacis nullus modus à Caesarea Majestate intentatus relinquatur, si Tur∣cae nullo modo Caesareae supra citatae con∣tra Propositioni C. locum dare vellent, sed olim Proposito interdicto Uti Possidetis pacem coalescere mallent, Caesarea Ma∣jestas nec id comprehensa & in sua posses∣sione relicta Transylvania aspernabitur, verùm non obstante multo sibi cum Otto∣mannica Porta communi incommodo ex∣inde resultante, tractatum Pacis propter ea abrumpi non patietur, tum ut Serenis∣simo Magnae Britanniae Regi & Dominis Foederati Belgii Ordinibus Generalibus Pacem cum Ottomannica Porta summe
desiderantibus, quantum fieri potest, de∣ferat, tum etiam ut pro sua naturali pieta∣te & clementia essusioni Sanguinis huma∣ni parcat, & quà licet possibilibus conditio∣nibus sistat, quinimò, ut possibili modo realem pacis incundae promptitudinem supra memoratis potentiis sibi Foederatis testatam reddat, si Turcae per oblatum & hactenus in pacificationibus cum Porta Ottomannica fere semper observari soli∣tum interdictum Uti Possidetis, inclusa Transylvania, pacem inire non posse mor∣dicùs tuerentur & hujus temperamenti Cae∣sarea ex parte ineundi spem ab Excellen∣tissimo Domino Legato Angliae Turcis pro obtinenda pace injici posse permittit, sci∣licet si restitutâ Transylvaniâ Juniori A∣pafi: Quem status elegerunt & cùm Cae∣sar tum Porta Ottomannica confirmavit: In perpetuum tamen abinde excluso pro∣ditore Tökelio, suis antiquis juribus, li∣bertatibus & privilegiis, sub aequali utri∣usque Imperii protectione & commodo de∣inceps liberè vivere sinat; Contra, Porta Ottomannica trans Danubium, Varadi∣num, Temesvarinum, Gyula, Jenova, Lippa, aliaque omnia loca quae armis Ottomanni∣cis in ultra Danubianis & Tibiscanis par∣tibus tenentur & partium Hungaricarum nomine audiunt, ad Portam Ferream us∣que inclusivè, simul etiam quae inter Da∣nubium & Savum ultra Dravum momen∣tanea & dubiâ possessione tenet, Sacrae Cae∣sareae Majestati in statu quo munita cedat, nulla ibidem Portae Ottomannicae rema∣nente praetensione. Ad Art. Sextum, Nihil dicendum oc∣currit, sed omnia ad contenta hoc Art. Sexto Caesarei responsi comprehensa de∣ducenda sunt, proptereà quod de iis alio modo suppositâ honestâ & tutâ pace ab utrinque facienda transigi non possit. Ad Art. Septimum. Caesarei responsi nihil dicendum cum per se clarus sit & Caesaream intentionem sine omni aequivo∣co explicet. Quae verò Articulis, Octavo & Nono, Caesarei responsi comprehensa leguntur, vix est quod Pacis Negotium morentur, eo duntaxat excepto, quod Art. Nono de liberè muniendis Utriusque Imperii placi∣tis consiniis stipulandum proponitur quod nullatenus alterari vel omitti potest, eò quod utriusque Imperii securitas in hoc po∣tissimum sita deprehendatur. Ad Appendicem Caesarea ex parte prae∣supponitur quod, Turcis in suis exhibiti∣onibus respectu Foederatorum Serenissimo∣rum Regis Poloniae, & Reipublicae Vene∣tae exhibitis permanentibus, magna Pacis facilitandae ratio apparitura sit, quamvis desuper cum iis potissimum transigendum maneat. De quibus omnibus pacis ineundae & facilitandae temperamentis, suo ordine gradatim proponendis, ut Excellentissimus Dominus Legatus Angliae cum Portae Ot∣tomannicae Ministris & Magno Vizirio praecipuè colloqui, spemque obtinendo∣rum à Caesareis commodè facere poterit, ita meminerit, dictorum temperamento∣rum proponendorum ac desuper Turca∣rum ad Pacem inclinatorum, vel ab ea a∣versorum sensum penetrandi liberam, ut supradictum, sibi facultatem quidem cre∣ditam, verùm ipsius negotii Pacis conclu∣sionem, Augusto Imperatori, Domino Domino nostro Clementissimo reservatam habere & ita remanere debere, ut super propositis & acceptatis temperamentis de∣mum hic Viennae tractatus formaliter con∣cludi debeat, cùm vel maximè id praeterea observandum, quod Caesarea Regiaque Majestas sine Foederatis suis Serenissimo Poloniae Rege & Serenissima Republica Veneta Pacem, uti saepius declaravit, nec factura sit nec facere possit; Quare ad se ponendum inter Caesarem Augustum & Turcarum Imperatorem currens bellum praecisè requiritur, ut & cum Caesareis Foederatis praememoratis, de pacificatione ipsorum quoque tractetur, & ad tractan∣dum cum ipsis Ablegati Turcici conveni∣enter instruantur. Suggerendum praeterea occurrit Excel∣lentissimo Domino Legato Angliae quod Sacra Caesarea Majestas his conditionibus ultra finem Junii circiter se adstrictam permanere non intendat. Porrò si supremus Vizirius per praesen∣tes Portae Ottomannicae Ministros tracta∣tum continuare nollet vel alios submittere vellet, nullam ex parte Caesarea hac in re difficultatem experietur. Et quia saepe memorati Ablegati Tur∣cici varias male fundatas querelas & acto∣rum exculpationem, nomine sincerae cu∣jusdam informationis sub D, huc ad Au∣lam  Caesaream remisernnt & in dubium videtur, has ipsas querelas eorum, cumu∣latis sinistris informationibus, ad Portam Ottomannicam delatas fuisse; visum fuit de earum querelarum momento Excellen∣tissimum Dominum Legatum Angliae per adjacens scriptum E. informare, simulque  materiam fundatissimae refutationis, si quae sibi de his apud Portam Ottomanni∣cam objicerentur, suppeditare.
Desideratur hoc praetereà ab Excellen∣tissimo Domino Legato Angliae; ut nihil nomine Caesareo sed omnia quasi ex man∣dato sui Serenissimi Regis hîc in aula Cae∣sarea penetrata proferat & agot, simul e∣tiam quam Proposito apud Portam Otto∣mannicam ad sanciendam Pacem vel con∣tinuandum bellum dispositionem repere∣rit, expressis & festinis Cursoribus nunci∣are non gravetur. PERPENSIS Instructionibus, quae mandato Sacrae Caesareae Majestatis Excellentiae Vestrae 31 Martii, Domi∣nis Legato & Ablegatis Serenissimi & Potentissimi Magnae Britanniae Regis & P. P. Dominorum Ordinum Foederati Belgii impertire voluere respondent: Accepta esse Sacrae Caesareae Maje∣stati dicti Magnae Britanniae Regis & D. D. Ordinum ad promovendam cum Porta Ottomannica pacem officia, per Excellentissimos Dominos Hussey & Col∣lier, ad Portam Ottomanicam Legatos oblata & ipsis concredita, se grato a∣nimo percepisse, utque jam tantum ne∣gotium eò efficacius aggrediantur, de a∣liquibus communicatis & tractandis, quo plenius informari possint, decenter ro∣gant. In Propositione ab Ablegatis Turcicis datâ, (Litera C.) reclusa fulgidae Portae sententia de satisfactione Foederatis Impe∣rialibus praebendâ, Regi scilicet Poloniae & S. Reip. Venetae, proferri videtur, cui nul∣lum datur responsum, quamvis in replica∣tione ejusdem expectatio suggeritur, ideo∣que praedicti Legatus & Ablegati nonnihil mirantur Articulum tanti momenti taci∣tum praeteriisse Excellentias Vestras, eò magis quod ratio productae Domini Lega∣ti Commorationis credebatur esse Foedera∣torum responsi expectatio, quod & etiam ita fuisse dicebatur, & de quo proculdubio Foederati praedicti Oratores suos hic resi∣dentes, quantum ad ipsorum praetensio∣nes attinet, certiores fecere. Perpen∣dere velint Excellentiae Vestroe expresse in Instructionibus Legato & Ablegatis concreditis slatui, ut nihil omninò, pri∣usquam Foederatis satisfiat consentiretur, atque igitur materiâ illâ non lucidatâ inca∣paces planè se putant Legati servitia huic tractatui utilia praeslare, cum facile nimis exponi viderentur dignitas Regis & DD. Ordinum, aliqua etiam ratione Sacrae Cae∣sareae Majestatis Consilia & Excellentissi∣morum Dominorum Legatorum character; non probabile enim est, fulgidam Portam velle de concilianda pace agere, priusquam resciverit, quibus legibus cum Foederatis tractari possit, justè suspicante Visirio, ne tractatu inito ipsiusque ita mente per∣specta Sociorum aliquis postmodo ini∣quas & non approbandas exigendo Condi∣tiones à quibusvis pactis recedere, nul∣lisque unquam stipulationibus teneri que∣at, hac solutâ difficultate Excellentissimi DD. Legati alacri animo opus promptis∣simi aggredientur. Quâ ergò par est instantiâ Excellentias Vestras orant Legatus & Ablegati, ut plenius mate∣ria ista aperiatur, quae Considerationi Excellentiarum Vestrarum remittitur, & cui necessarium creditur, ut respon∣deatur. De remittendâ Transylvaniâ Principi Apafi cum omnibus Privilegiis, &c. tri∣butoque quod petunt Turcae promitten∣do, si arrogati pro hac cessione terri∣torii partem tantum aliquam concede∣re immoretur Visirius, an pertinaciter Propositioni Imperiali insistendum sit, petitur. Si velit Magnus Visirius tracta∣tum inire, ea conditione, ut unicui∣que Imperio maneant acquisita, quo∣modo se gerere debeant Legati, nulla Foederatorum mentione factâ, quaeri∣tur. An terminus, qui ad finem Junii of∣fluit, non sit extendendus considerati∣oni Excellentiarum Vestrarum exhibe∣tur; aut si post illud tempus om∣nis ulterioris tractatus Propositio rejici∣atur.
Instructions for the English and Holland Ambassadors, in re∣spect to the Three Allies, Vi∣enna, April 12th. 1692. Collaudato Excellentissimi Do∣mini Legati Angliae & Domino∣rum Ablegatorum Angliae & Hol∣landiae de Re Christiana bene merendi syncero studio & pru∣denti de amovendis obstaculis quae negotium creditum morari vel turbare possent, suscepta curâ ad puncta oblata respondendum duxerunt Deputati ad hoc Caesa∣rei Ministri. Ad Primum. IN Caesareo ad Turcicam Propositionem ultimam concepto responso Articulum de foederatis tractantem nullarenus omis∣sum fuisse, sed aliter quam ibi reperitur, propter ea concipi non potuisse, quod Se∣renissimus Poloniae Rex & Serenissima Res∣publica Veneta, etsi in prosequendo bello Sacrae Caesareae Majestati foedere sociati, & pariter ad pacem seorsivam non faciendam, nec aliter quam simul sanciendam obliga∣ti sint, nihilominus tractandarum suarum conditionum Pacis arbitri manserunt; quare permissa ipsis singulorum cum Tur∣cis complanatione de iis, quae eosdem foe∣deratos tangebant, non nisi per generalia loquendum erat; Caeterum Ablegatus Poloniae Dominus Prosky communicatio∣nem suarum conditionum cum D D. Mi∣nistris Angliae & Hollandiae non quidem abnuit, sed ulteriorem tractationem & con∣clusionem non aliter, quam hîc Viennae  faciendam reservavit, quas allegatum A. repraesentabit. Excellentissimus Legatus Venetus, ubi Caesaream contra Propositi∣onem por Ablegatos Turcicos repudiatam intellexit, cum sua sibi reticendum existi∣mavit, constanter asseverans, tractatum Pacis simultaneum per foederatos cum Turcis instituendum non alibi, quàm hîc Viennae prosequi & concludi posse, unde specie confidentiae, & reservato, ne aliter quam pro mea directione communicata crederentur, conditiones suae Serenissimae Reipublicae Turcis quadoque communi∣candas  allegato B. comprehensas mihi Co∣miti Kinsky exhibuit: Verùm cùm prae∣dicti ministri uterque ulteriorem cum Turcis super suis oblatis conditionibus tra∣ctationem hic Viennae instituendam sibi reservent, satis constat, has ipsas suas con∣ditiones non esse ultimas, sed agendo de∣super cum Turcis in pluribus fortè adhuc moderandas; quare horum omnium in∣tuitu requiruntur Domini Legati Angliae & Hollandiae, ut primo puncto Caesarei scripti sibi communicato de obtinendis pro Ablegatis Turcicis novis Instructionibus ad prosequendum tractatum Pacis necessa∣riis presse inhaereant, nec indè facile rece∣dant, cùm experientia edoctura sit, majo∣ri incommodo & minori fructu ad Pacem inter foederatos & Portam Ottomannicam sanciendam tractatus alibi, quam hic Vi∣ennae reassumendos & perficiendos fore. Ad Secundum. Constat, intuitu Officiorum à Serenissi∣mo & Potentissimo Magnae Britanniae Re∣ge & Praepotentibus Dominis Generalibus foederati Belgii Ordinibus oblatorum Cae∣saream Majestatem temperamenta scripto Excellentissimo Domino Legato Angliae, & Dominis Ablegatis exhibita, non ad ip∣sam concludendam Pacem, sed potissimùm ad introducendam dispositionem ad tracta∣tum Pacis hîc Viennae reassumendum pro∣posuisse; quare si Magnus Visirius resti∣tutâ Apafio Transylvaniâ sub aequali pro∣rectione & Commodo utriusque Imperii cum suis juribus & Privilegiis petita ter∣ritoria non omnia, sed tantum eorum par∣tem concedere vellet, nullarenus ipsi as∣sentiendum, sed desideratis impensè in∣haerendum fore, cùm absque cessione pe∣titi Territorii nihil sit, quod Sacram Cae∣saream Majestatem ad restitutionem dictae Transylvaniae permovere, vel obligare possit; verùm quia ejusmodi tractatus graves & momentosi non uno, ut dici so∣let, ictu perficiuntur, ubi Domini Legati Angliae & Hollandiae certiora de Turcarum intentionibus ad nos perscripserint, com∣modior tùm de porrò faciendis vel omit∣tendis deliberatio institui poterit. Ad Tertium. Foederatorum satisfactionis debitae, cum sine ea Pax coalescere non possit, semper erit facienda mentio & remon∣stranda Turcis cum iisdem Foederatis de∣super ulterius tractandi necessitas, hoc tamen verum est, quod complanatis inter Sacram Caesaream Majestatem & Portani Ottomannicam ad prosequendum tracta∣tum dispositionibus Sacra Caesarea Maje∣stas omnia officia adhibitura sit, ut & tùm Foederatos suos ad justas & honestas
Pacis Conditiones acceptandas dedu∣cat. Ad Quartum. De prorogatione termini in Obligatione ad has Conditiones persistendi sapientissi∣me monuerunt Excellentissimus Dominus Legatus & Illustriss. Domini Ablegati An∣gliae & Hollandiae, quia tamen res in con∣tinuo motu constitutae naturaliter & facile alterantur, ideoque difficile est, ad tem∣peramentorum propositorum acceptatio∣nem se indefinitè obstringere & simili vin∣culo absque ulla restrictione inhaerere, ideò dicto Mensi Junio totum Mensem Julium denominando substituere visum fu∣it, quem intrà si dispositio saepedicta ad reassumendos tractatus, rejecta huc Vi∣ennam ejusdem conclusione, apud Portam Ottomannicam induci non posset, non e∣quidem proptereà de iis porrò tractandis cessandum foret, sed ita de iis agere con∣tinuandum ut subsecutâ rerum notabili alteratione de eadem complanandâ missis Cursoribus necessariae quaestiones inde emanatae proponantur, quae dicta rerum alteratio, si Caesareis armis, ut in Deum confiditur, prospera foret, omni conatu de eadem Legatos Angliae & Hollandiae certiores reddere, & monere non inter∣mittetur. Viennae, 12 Aprilis 1692.

D. Cardinalis à Kolonitz carceres Sabarienses, in despe∣ctum status Evangelici, publico spectacu∣lo expositus, lamentabiliter deductus sit, quin Excellentiis Vestris jam innotescat, non dubito. Quo propter praedicationem Verbi Divini, à sua Majestate Serenissima diaetaliter clementissime concessam, satis crudeliter capto, vinculato, durissimisque aliquot centenarum plagarum verberibus multis vicibus afflicto, & omnibus bonis privato: Ego in misera jam sorte consti∣tuta, eoque magis, quod jammodo sub praetextu homicidii contra fanam Consci∣entiam à nonnullis apud Augustam Au∣lam ipsi innocentissimo Sanguini adscripti, (ac si, inquam, tempore prioris tumul∣tus, aliquis ex illis nocturnis latronibus, quod alias omnes omnino omni jure pro∣meriti fuissent, interfectus fuisset; cum illi ex adverso ipsos inhabitatores potius ejusdem loci globo trajecerint, & saucia∣verint:) Et in praesentiarum in Eminent.

Joannis Baptistae non pridem transactum, missis certo numero ad locum ordinariae Residentiae meae in Possessione Polanii (alias more nobilitari) habitae Germanicis militibus, datisque mandatis, me capi, diversimode excruciari, percuti, pedibusque suspendi, sicque ineffabilibus cruciatibus affectum ad Arcem Sabarien∣sem sub jurisdictione Eminentissimi Prin∣cipis Cardinalis à Kolonitz constitutam, deductum, ac compedibus vinctum, ali∣quot centenarum plagarum verberibus sauciatum, manibus fractis, aliisque cor∣poris mei membris concussis ad squalidos carceres conjici curasset, ubi impraesenti∣arum miserrime detineret. Dum autem juxta quorundam benevo∣lorum affidatione beatam desideratissimae liberationis meae horam momentaneae ex∣spectarem, deteriora experiri cogor: Ubi his non longe praeteritis diebus cum prae∣senter concluderem, aerumnosus ego homo deductus in portam arcis, nisi me per u∣nam vaccam redemissem, aliquot plagas suffere coactus fuissem. Accepi jam, Ex∣cellentissime Domine, quadringentas pla∣gas; gloriam tamen tribuens Deo meo, quod me dignum fecerit pati pro nomine suo. Imo hoc me maxime angit, quod, qui captivum me detinerent, & qui contu∣mulant me carcere exemptum, & (salvo honore) inter canes coacte sedentem, gra∣vi sub comminatione, libratis videlicet ad caput meum ferreis clavis, adigerent, di∣centes, Canito, canito, inquiunt, scivisti equidem in stabulo, id est in templo, boare, rugire, & clamitare. His & similibus sine intermissione aures meae onerantur, & gra∣vantur, adque fidem Religioni meae con∣trariam omni severiore modalitate, imo brevi me ad triremes mittere velle, & aliis terriculamentis compellerer. Ob id iterato scripti hujusce humilita∣te Excellentiae Vestrae demisse supplico, humillime ac per viscera Misericordiae Di∣vinae orans, quatenus ex Zelo Misericor∣diae dignetur afflictissimae sortis meae mise∣reri
seque debetis in locis gratiosis suis partibus interponere, & me ex his squali∣dis carceribus eliberari facere. Quam gratiam Excellentiae Vestrae perpetua a∣nimi devotione, grataeque mentis recorda∣tione quam demississime demereri omni studio conabor, tanquam Ejusdem Excellentiae Vestrae Humillimus Cliens Petrus Nemus, quondam Possessionis Polanii Helveticae Confessio∣nis Praedicans, nunc Sabariae in Eminentis∣simi Cardinalis car∣cere patiens. Sacratissima Caesarea Regiaque Majestas.

Ast ubi ex debito obtemperandi obsequio altetitulati Princi∣pis à Dittrichstein factae amandationi i∣dem homines nostri condignum morem gerentes suam Eminentiam Principalem praerepetitae Majestatis vestrae Sacratissimae extra datae benignissimae determinationis convenientis expeditionis elargiendae cau∣sa quam devotissime requisivissent, áque sua Eminentia ad Ill. D. intimi Consilii Bellici Secretarium à Krapff, cujus officii & muneris esset eosdem juxta praedeclara∣tam Majestatis Vestrae Sacratissimae deter∣minationem expedite, remissi fuissent, per suam tamen Illustritatem, ut ut condecen∣ter requisitam, saepe saepiusque interpella∣tam, in tantum protractum est praementi∣onatae expeditionis nostrae negotium, ut altememoratae suae Eminent. Principalis Cardinalis à Kolonich quoque inopinatus discessus Romam supervenerit, eoque ipso ruptum, ac tandem diversis certorum ne∣cessariorum Actorum, praeviae expeditioni accommodandorum, non reperibilium, & fors per suam Eminent. Principalem, vel inclytam Cancellariam Hungaricam, eó tum absentem, & ad latus Majestatis Ve∣strae Sacratissimae existentem, reclusorum protelationibus interjectis, maxima omni∣um nostri cum infelicitate, & summa Con∣scientiarum nostrarum, liberique Exercitii nostri Evangelici cum coangustatione, ad praeattactae suae Eminent. Principalis re∣ditum relegatum, in suo priori turbato sta∣tu remanserit impraesentiarum, citra ul∣lam cordialium desideriorum nostrorum effectuationem, & Majestatis Vestrae Sa∣cratissimae pientissimam Ordinationem.

Exhib. suae Majest. die 17 Martis 1690. Sacratissima Caesarea Regiaque Majestas. Domine, Domine nobis Clementissime, MAJESTATI vestrae Sacratissimae tot ac tantis S. R I. Regnorumque suorum pacandorum curis alias implicitae, rebusque publicis Christianis conservandis paternè intentae, subinde ac subinde impor∣tunos nos esse debere fatemur, erubesci∣mus: Verum justo dolore assiduos gemitus querimoniasque nostras exprimente, urgen∣tissima necessitate cogimur & compellimur, dum jam supra duos annos integros & me∣dium hic apud Majestatis vestrae Sacratis∣simae Augustam Aulam multifariam contra Articulos Sopronienses laesae Religionis no∣strae negotium continua quasi actione me∣dio certorum hominum nostrorum quam humillime sollicitamus: Neque vero ea∣tenus ad innumera fere memorialia nostra eidem Majestati vestrae Sacratissimae, ejus∣demque summis Ministris in omni sub∣missione porrecta adusque quicquam certae & solidae resolutionis obtinere potuimus, praeter quod proxime ex relatione Celsissi∣mi Principis à Dietrichstein Supremi Aulae praefecti intellexerimus, Majestatem ve∣stram Sacratissimam praeattactos Articulos Sopronienses de negotio Religionis condi∣tos sanctè omnino & illibatè conservare, iisdemque firmiter inhaerere velle. Inte∣rea nos obscura quadam ac à longe petita interpretatione eorundem Articulorum plura, quam iidem continerent, & admit∣terent, petere. Hinc conformia nos iis∣dem postulare, adeoque Gravamina no∣stra juxta evidentissimas continentias eo∣rundem Articulorum edocere debere, sic∣que etiam nos convenienter expedien∣dos fore gratiosissime resolvisse & decla∣rasse. Cui Majestatis vestrae Sacratissimae be∣nignissimae Resolutioni nosmet in omni hu∣militate obsequiosissime accommodantes, (quamvis satis superque Gravamina, & injurias nostras ad manifestum Articulo∣rum Soproniensium sensum ac tenorem de∣duxerimus) ut jam tandem clementissimam Caesareo-Regiam Resolutionem adeoque ad desideria nostra concupitam expeditio∣nem assequi valeamus, praesenti iterata dictorum Articulorum Soproniensium per contigua eorundem membra formalis con∣textus primum partitione & consignatio∣ne, tandem multiplicium grandium inju∣riarum, tam per ordinatas Commissiones Regias, quam earum homines, ac alios etiam ingerentes diversimode exquisitis sub praetetibus nobis illatarum, juxta quodlibet memoratorum Articulorum membrum, perspicua declaratione & re∣monstratione, justissimae denique, & per omnia clarissimo Articulorum sensui con∣formis Instantiae nostrae luculenta deducti∣one & elucidatione nos iisdem Articulis, donec futurarum diaetarum occasione ex toto in integrum restituamur, stare, nec transversa aliqua interpretatione, quam iidem expressissimis verbis se solos clare explicarent, aliud, sed nec plus, quam permitterent, petere: Sumpto fiduciali ad Gratiae, Clementiae, & Justitiae plenissi∣mum Majestatis vestrae Sacratissimae Thro∣num recursu nostro Majestati vestrae Sa∣cratissimae in profundissima subjectione re∣capitulatis Gravaminibus nostris reprae∣sentandum conveniens duximus, & qui∣dem modalitate sequenti. Primo, quoad Articul. XXV. Ann. 1681. Diaetae Soproniensis, ejusque Primum Membrum, cu∣jus formalis Continentia haec est. ET quia propter bonum Pacis, Tranquilli∣tatemque Regni publicam, in Negotio Religionis quoque sua Majestas sese benigne resolvere dignata est, ideo eandem etiam Re∣solutionem Articulis Regni status & Ordines inserunt. Ac imprimis quidem, cum liberum Religionis exercitium jam antea in Anno 1606. vigore Pacificationis Viennensis con∣cessum,
his motibus à parte nonnullorum inter∣turbatum fuisset, consirmato hic loci Articulo I. dictae Pacificationis, idem Exercitium omnibus & ubique per Regnum (salvo tamen jure Do∣minorum terrestrium) juxta Artic. I. Ann. 1608. ante Coronationem editum, liberum permittitur. Contra hoc Membrum primum in eo nos injuriatos resentiscimus, quod cum benignissima hac Majestatis vestrae Sacra∣tissimae resolutione, & tenore hujus Arti∣culi membri primi liberum Religionis Ex∣ercitium, priorum annorum sub tumulti∣bus à parte nonnullorum interturbatum, generaliter omnibus & ubique per Reg∣num, nullo regnicolarum, cujuscumque tandem status & conditionis esset, sed nec ullo etiam loco Regni Castrensi, Comi∣tatensi, Civitatensi, Oppidano, Confini∣ario, & Villano exceptis, ad mentem prae∣allegatorum Articulorum denuo liberum permissum, & nec ad hunc, vel illum lo∣cum restrictum, quin tali generalitate confirmatae libertatis coactio amplecten∣darum Religionum penitus sublata es∣set. Excelsae nihilominus Commissiones Re∣giae, ad Superiores & Inferiores Regni Hungariae Partes diversis temporibus An∣norum praeteritorum emissae, partim per se, partim vero per homines privatos tali libero Exercitio Religionis libere ali∣as & manifeste, etiam in privatis aedibus, per totum Regnum, non tamen simplici∣ter, verum medio ministrorum ante & post diaetam Soproniensem exercito & usu∣ato, non solum. Primo, complures liberas, Regias, ac Montanas Civitates, signanter in inferio∣ri Hungaria, Pusztiensem, Kuszeghien∣sem, Szent-Gyórgyensem, Baziniensem, Tyrnaviensem, Szakolczensem, Vetero∣zoliensem, Carponensem, (de nomine a∣lias in Articulo 26. specificatam) & Brez∣nobaniensem. In Montanis Civitatibus vero, Schemnicziensem, Libethbanien∣sem, Belobaniensem, & Uybaniensem: Et in superiore Hungaria, recentissime Nagybaniensem, contra expressas Articu∣lares Sanctiones, & eorum permissiones, & quidem I. Citati primi▪ Membri ad verba: Ideo confirmato hic loci Articulo I. dictae Pacifica∣tionis idem Exercitium omnibus & ubique per Regnum liberum permisit. II. Ibidem Consirmatae Pacificationis primi Articuli ad expressa verba: Nimirum, quod omnes & singulos Status & Ordines, tam in∣tra ambitum Regni Hungariae solum existen∣tes, tam Magnates, Nobiles, quam liberas Civitates, Oppida privilegiata immediate ad Coronam spectantia: Item in Confiniis quoque Regni Hungariae Milites Hungaros in sua Religione & Confessione nusquam & numquam turbabit, nec per alios turbari & impediri si∣net, (scilicet sua Majestas Sacratissima) ve∣rum omnibus praedictis Statibus & Ordinibus Regni liber Religionis ipsorum usus & exerci∣tium permittetur. III. Itidem ibidem allegati & confirmati, Ann. 1608. ante Coronationem editi Articu∣li I. aeque expressa verba: Quantum itaque ad primum Constitutionis Viennensis Articu∣lum attinet, deliberatum est per Status & Or∣dines Regni Hungariae, ut Religionis Exer∣citium tam Baronibus, Magnatibus, & Nobi∣libus, quam etiam liberis Civitatibus, ac u∣niversis Statibus & Ordinibus Regni, in suis & Fisci bonis: Item in Confiniis quoque Regni Hungariae Militibus Hungaris, sua cuique Religio, nec non oppidis & villis eam sponte & libere acceptare volentibus, ubique liberum relinquatur, nec quisquam omnium in libero ejus usu ac exercitio, quoquum modo impedia∣tur: Quinimo, ad praecavenda inter Status & Ordines aliqua Odia & dissensiones, quaeli∣bet Religio suos superiores, seu superatten∣dentes habeat, statutum est, Citra ullam considerationem, quod Li∣berae, ac Regiae, & Montanae Civitates, adeoque ex ordine Statuum cum reliquis civitatibus quartus Regni liber status es∣sent, parique cum iisdem libertate gaude∣rent, inque confirmatis hisce Articulis ge∣neraliter comprehenderentur, ex eo solum capite, quod de nomine in Articulis So∣proniensibus specificatae non essent, gravi cum earundem injuria, & extrema Reli∣gionis internecione, amotis earundem Ec∣clesiae Evangelicae Ministris, frequentati∣one item locorum, ubi Religionis exerci∣tium vigeret: Prout & omnium Actuum Ministerialium ibidem fruitione, admis∣sione adhaec quorumcunque Praedicantium ad infirmos suos, & in agone constitutos, consolandos, & communicandos absolute vetita: Quin ut in his, & similibus prae∣cise introductorum Catholicorum Pleban∣orum & Parochorum opera utantur, seria injunctione facta, cum aggravatione Con∣scientiarum omnimode constrictas, ex in∣tegro privarunt: Verum Secundo: Comitatus quoque quam∣plurimos: Uti Posoniensem, Mossonien∣sem ex toto, Nitriensem, Trenchinien∣sem, Arvensem, Lyptoviensem, Turoc∣ziensem, Zoliensem, Barsiensem, Hon∣thensem, Soproniensem, Castriferri, ali∣osque
infinitis eorundem templis Evange∣licis occupatis, Ministrisque insimul suis relegatis in simili Religionis eorundem li∣bero exercitio, aeque contra praemissorum Articulorum apertissimam Constitutionem turbarunt, ac ad duo saltem obscurissimo∣rum pagorum inconvenientia loca, exqui∣sita quasi opera, adhuc extra eosdem pa∣gos in campo, erectioni novorum Tem∣plorum, Scholarum, & Parochiarum, Ex∣ercitioque Evangelico ibidem tenendo de∣stinata, & excisa, totidemque Ministros, & non plures intertenendos, restrinxerunt, quibus aegrotantibus, nullo potiri possent exercitio. Villanis vero, seu Rusticis, qui à prae∣repetita Generalitate juxta saepe allegatos Articulos excludi nequirent, vi nimium praejudiciosae, inque exterminium Evange∣licorum adjectae clausulae: Salvo jure Do∣minorum Terrestrium (quae tamen non jus Dominii in conscientias, quod solius Dei proprium esset, sed jus servitutis Cor∣poralis respiceret) indiscriminatim totali Evangelico exercitio, ejusdemque Mini∣sterialium Actuum usu ubilibet locorum abstinendo, inhibuerunt, ac ad Ecclesias Catholicas frequentandas, harumque Mi∣nisterio & ritibus in omnibus utendis, a∣lioquin per vim & fortia compellendi ve∣nirent, strictissimo edicto coarctarunt. Tertio: Reliquas etiam civitates, quam∣vis Articulariter (juxta nempe Artic. 26. membrum quintum) in specie, uti, Po∣soniensem, Modrensem, & Trenchinien∣sem, in inferiori Hungaria: Et in Mon∣tanis, Cremniczensem, & Novizoliensem; ac in superiori Hungaria in genere deno∣minatas, quales essent Cassovia, Leut∣schovia, Bartpha, Epperiés, Cibinium, Keimarkinum, (ad quas Nagybania quo∣que in Comitatu Szathmariensi situata ci∣vitas pertineret: Noviter tamen post in∣clytam Commissionem Preynerianam, suo permisso libero exercitio, ut infra decla∣rabitur, integre privata) quibus post a∣demptionem omnium templorum liberum Religionis exercitium est permissum, cer∣torum aedificandis Templis, Parochiis & Scholis locorum (non tamen plerisque a∣deo commodorum & convenientium, ut infra Articuli 26. Membro secundo innu∣etur) excisione & assignatione circa essen∣tialia Religionis Evangelicae requisita, plane extra continentias Articulorum So∣proniensium inconvenientibus conditio∣nibus. 1. Ut nonnisi duos Praedicantes ipsis intertenere liceat. 2. In casu obitus unius alterum in e∣jusdem locum introducere ipsis vetitum sit. 3. Ne Ministri eorundem vicinorum; aut etiam aliorum peregrinorum locorum Evangelicis quibuscunque actibus Mini∣sterialibus, ac etiam sacris, quoquo modo subservire, sed nec etiam eorundem infir∣mos & agonizantes visitare audeant. 4. Cehae & Collegia Evangelicorum Opificum ut processionibus intersint Ca∣tholicorum, consuetaque vexilla sub amis∣sione privilegiorum ipsisment fieri cu∣rent. 5. Scholas tantum triviales aliquantuni legere & scribere decentes teneant. 6. Ut Parochis & Plebanis Catholicis ex publico proventu Civitatum Salarium, Evangelicis vero Ministris & Scholarum Rectoribus ex propria Evangelicorum pe∣cunia pendatur. 7. In Xenodochiis plures mendicos Ca∣tholicos, quam Evangelicos intertene∣ant. 8. Officiales Evangelicos, ut ut idone∣os, ab officiis amoveant, & quoscunque Catholicos subordinent. 9. Officia Civilia magna & praecipua sal∣tem Catholicis conferant, aliisque circum∣scripserunt: Sed & Quarto: Illos insuper Comitatus, qui in actuali usu omnium fere templorum, horumque accessoriorum Evangelicorum▪ tempore conditorum Articulorum Sopro∣niensium fuerunt, ac etiam in reali eorun∣dem Dominio (vi 25 Articuli inferius al∣legandorum tertii & sexti Membrorum) relicti sunt, & relinquendi erant, adeoque à similibus Commissionibus immunes om∣nino declarati, deque nomine specificati essent, uti Szaladiensem, Veszprimiensem, Jauriensem, Comaromiensem, Abauyva∣riensem, Saarosiensem, Zempliniensem; Ughocziensem, Bereghiensem, Thornen∣sem, Gomoriensem, Borsodiensem, Hon∣thensem, Nogradiensem, Szolnokiensem, & Hevessiensem; nec non Pestiensem, Pilisiensem, & Solitensem unitos: Item Szabolczensem, Unghensem, & Szath∣mariensem, majori ex parte potioribus su∣is templis & accessoriis, integralique libe∣ro exercitio cum expulsione Ministrorum, indiscriminatim orbarunt.
Quae omnia confrontatione ad praemis∣sum Membrum primum hujus Artic. 25. inibique citatos, & expressissimis verbis allegatos, facta cum praeviae confirmatae libertatis generalitati ad omnes & singu∣los Status & Ordines Regni, adeoque om∣nes Magnates & Nobiles, Civitates, om∣nia etiam confinia, oppida & villas evi∣dentissime se extendenti è diametro oppo∣sita essent, actuque ipso ex libera Religi∣one non liberam, ex non turbanda studio turbatam & turbandam facerent. Majestati vestrae Sacratissimae demisse sup∣plicamus, quatenus aequa sapientissimi judicii sui lance pensitata: Primum; Praespecificatarum quatuor∣decim Civitatum totali liberi sui exercitii beneficio contra manifestas memoratorum Articulorum Statutiones (vigore quarum ipsis quoque qua liberis, & montanis Ci∣vitatibus, adeoque quarto Statui Regni li∣berum apud se, & ubique suae Religionis exercitium habere permissum esset) pri∣vatarum summa injuria eisdem (non ob∣stante, quod nominatim in Articulis So∣proniensibus non exstent, quippe istius∣modi libertate in genere permissa sufficie∣bat, duas, tres, quatuorve Civitates, uti sequenti Artic. 26. ejusdemque Membro quinto fit, pro exemplo denominare, cum denominatio & positio unius alteriusve Ci∣vitatis non esset reliquarum à praemissa li∣bertate exclusio; alioquin sequeretur uni∣us conditionem alterius conditione esse deteriorem) aeque sicut aliis congrua, & (reflexione habita ad caput verborum 26 Articuli Soproniensis pro Commoditate Evangelicorum aedificandis Templis, Pa∣rochiis, & Scholis, &c.) omnino commo∣da exscindenda loca demonstrari & assig∣nari curare, eoque ipso hactenus sublatum liberum Religionis ipsarum exercitium rursum integre reassumere, medioque Mi∣nistrorum suorum pro beneplacito vocan∣dorum exercere, & continuare, ex indulto Articulari, auctoritateque sua Regia be∣nignissime permittere. Tandem, habita Comitatuum quoque praemissorum constrictorum condigna ra∣tione, cassatis praememoratis extra pagen∣sibus obscuris & inconvenientibus desig∣natis locis, ipsis templa in articulariter denominatis pagis existentia, ubi alias vix duo vel tres Catholici, alibi vero vix u∣nus quidem reperirentur, nec etiam duo templa, duas Parochias, duas Scholas, duplices etiam Ministros diversarum Re∣ligionum in tam exiguis & obscuris pagel∣lis, dum duplici horum intertentioni non sufficerent, tenere, vel ad evitandas aemulationes & scandala ex diversitate ri∣tuum facile enascenda, congruum esset re∣stitui facere, omnibusque in medio sui ex∣istentibus cujuscunque status & conditio∣nis hominibus, juxta vigorem praescripto∣rum Articulorum, & Paragraphum ipsius 25 Articuli Soproniensis: Omnibus & u∣bique per Regnum, rescissa contra nutum & voluntatem Evangelicorum adjecta clausula: Salvo jure Dominorum terre∣strium; ejusdemque exotica interpretati∣one, per Clerum & Dominos Catholicos ad conscientias abusive extendente, inde∣que Dominium in conscientias, quod so∣lius Dei, non vero hominum esset, sibi∣met vendicante, Religionis suae exerciti∣um medio Praedicantium suorum ubique libere exercendum, nec quanquam invitum ad contrarias Ceremonias quoquomo∣do amplectendas compellendum permit∣tere. Posthaec praenotatarum pariter Articu∣lariter denominatarum liberarum & Mon∣tanarum Superiorum & Inferiorum parti∣um Regni Civitatum incircumscriptae ad∣missae libertatis conditione considerata, easdem in praespecificatis memoratarum Commissionum praejudiciosis conditionibus & limitationibus, de quibus praevii om∣nes Articuli omnino silerent, nec liberum Religionis exercitium quoquomodo cir∣cumscriberent: Alias enim non liberum, sed restrictum, atque adeo captivum esset hoc exercitium, de plano absolutas red∣dere. Denique praeenumeratorum similiter Co∣mitatuum in Actuali possessione, usu, & Dominio Templorum, & omnium acces∣soriorum Evangelicorum, vi Articuli 26. relictorum, ad conformitatem datae grati∣osissimae Resolutionis Majestatis vestrae Sacratissimae dijudicata speciali exempti∣one, justa & effectiva omnium adempto∣rum templorum, appertinentiarum, & ac∣cessoriorum, haecque concomitantium li∣beri exercitii, & Ministrorum suorum re∣stitutione, eosdem in pristinum eorun∣dem jus, & possessionem praemissorum ad mentem praedeclaratorum Articulorum reduci curare, Clementissime dignetur. Contra Secundum Membrum, quod sic sonat. Praedicantibus quoque & Scholarum Magi∣stris, alias vel proscriptis, vel propter certas Reversales munia suae professionis exercere non valentibus, liber in Regnum reditus, li∣beraque
Religionis suae professio & exercitium, cassatis eatenus etiam ipsorum Reversalibus, conceditur. Ut ut lucidissime vi membri hujus non modo illi Praedicantes & Scholarum Ma∣gistri, qui tempore diaetae Soproniensis in sua in Regno habitatione, & libera Reli∣gionis Professione sunt stabiliti, verum si∣mul illis etiam, qui quavis de caussa tum e Regno exulabant, libera in Regnum re∣deundi, ubilibetve in Regno libere subsi∣stendi, & Religionis suae exercitium ac munia peragendi, data sit facultas, adeo∣que qualescunque etiam datae vel dandae Reversales Articulariter sint abolitae & cassatae. Huic tamen in contrarium dictae Com∣missiones passim ubique per Regnum du∣obus saltem Praedicantibus in singulo Co∣mitatu, ac uno vel altero in quibusdam Civitatibus permissis, reliquos omnes ex caeteris omnibus civitatibus, oppaedis, con∣finiis, & villis, partim sub decursu quin∣denae, partim tridui spatio, uti in Comi∣tatibus Lyptoviensi, Arvensi, Thuroc∣zensi, Zoliensi, & Honthensi, aliisque fa∣ctum, removerunt, partim vero extortis ab iis strictis Reversalibus super abdicati∣one officii, ad privatos angulos relega∣runt. Insuper Gymnasia & Scholas Evangeli∣corum ad Trivialia, aliquantum solum le∣gere & scribere discere restrinxerunt, unde ob carentiam harum, earumque docenti∣um ex parte sui nil amplius sperandum ha∣berent, quam impendentem respectu ju∣ventutis suae barbariem. Inde sumpsit occasionem Eminentissimus Princeps Cardinalis à Kolonich quinque Evangelicos Praedicantes, uti Puchovien∣sem, Nozdroviczensem, Ledniczensem, Bakabayaiensem, & Kochkoviensem, an∣no praeterito 89 capi, & ad arcem Led∣niczensem deduci curare, ibique strictissima incaptivatione ad subscriptionem inconve∣nientium Reversalium, statutionemque sub onere 200 Imperialium certorum fidejussorum adigere. Alios insuper tres Praedicantes, puta, Nemes Hollosiensem Helveticae & Szent∣benedekiensem ac Dobrajensem Augusta∣nae Confessionis A. similiter antecedente 89. in absentia Majestatis vestrae Sacratis∣simae incaptivatos, & Sabariae squalidissi∣mis carceribus dirissime excruciatos ad de∣fectionem Religionis cogere.

Residentiae pariter Nagybanya Pater Jesuita Ravasz nuncupatus possessionis Totthsalu in Comitatu Szathmariensi situa∣tae Praedicantem aeque capiendi, & Szath marinum ad carceres deferendi, ibique ad praesens detinendi, ad similem defectum à Religione, & depositionem Ministerii sui, reversalibus praejudiciosis constringere mi∣serum intendens; & quae alia aliorum plu∣rima essent attentata. Quae siquidem directissime contraria∣rentur Articuli hujus Membro secundo, Majestatem vestram Sacratissimam proni oramus, quatenus Regia sua prohibitione quorumcum{que} Praedicantium & Scholarum Rectorum Evangelicorum per quoscunque tandem quoque modo turbandorum, per∣sequendorum, damnificandorum, incapti∣vandorum, & ad quascunque Reversales dandas cogendorum, ad omnes suos fide∣les Status & Ordines Regni decretaliter extendenda (antelato interim misero Totth∣falusiensi Praedicante Szathmarino Capto è suis carceribus libere ad suos dimitti mandato) juxta claram Membri hujus se∣cundi mentem omnibus Praedicantibus & Scholarum Magistris libere in medio nostri permanendi, & Professionis suae munia at∣que exercitia extra quamvis limitationem, Scholariumque facultatum restrictionem peragendi facultatem attribuere. Et siquidem omnes tales Praedicantes ad duo, ut supra attactum, excisa loca in Artic. 26. denominata collocari non pos∣sent, relaxata & sublata juxta uberiorem modò citati Articuli Membri octavi, infe∣rius deducendi sensum, & Indultum in ora∣toriis Arcensibus & Residentialibus Domi∣norum Magnatum & Nobilium exercendi Religionis exercitii inhibitione per praefa∣tas

Quamvis tertii hujus membri genera∣litate nullum Regnicolarum, nec Ecclesi∣astici, nec seculares status, adeoque nec Magnates, nec Nobiles, nec Cives, nec Rusticos in libero Religionis suae exerci∣tio, nec in Persona, nec in Ecclesiis, sed nec in Ministris suis ullo modo perampli∣us turbandum venire apertissime cavere∣tur: Hoc nihilominus praeviae Commissiones Regiae, & privatae quaeque personae, non curato, exquisitis sub praetextibus & mo∣dis, quibus exprimendis vix verba nobis sufficiunt, ex Cleri & Status Catholici Sententia, quamplurimas Ecclesias in prae∣misso primo Membro specificatorum Co∣mitatuum & Civitatum expulsis, & è Reg∣no ire jussis corundem Ministris, tan∣quam causis exercitii exercendi instrumen∣talibus, sine quibus alias nullius sane Re∣ligionis exercitium exerceri quiret, in li∣bero exercitio turbarunt. Sic Magistratus modernus Catholicus Civitatis Epperies mox ex mandato Ma∣jestatis vestrae Sacratissimae, mox titulo Do∣minii Terrestris praetextum vendicatae si∣bi licentiae prae se ferens, omnes omnino trium Nationum Evangelicos Praedicantes è Civitate, alias loco Articulariter deno∣minato, adhuc Ann. 1688, ipso festo S. Bartholomaei Apostoli, expellere, ter∣ritorioque ejusdem prohibere, Ecclesiam∣que Articularem libero suo admisso exer∣citio, quo jam nunc careret, ipso facto privare non est veritus. Ita nihil pensi duxit non rampridem moderna Commissio Praineriana in supe∣riore Hungaria Civitatis Nagybanya (u∣nius nempe ex ordine, ut praemissum cae∣terarum Superiorum, partium liberarum Civitatum, per commissionem alias anti∣cipativam Czahianam in permisso suo li∣bero exercitio Evangelico ad instar alia∣rum Articularium libere usuando relictae) cives & incolas Evangelicos amandatione Praedicantium, & Scholae Rectorum suo∣rum cum severa interminatione omnium actuum Ministerialium alibi locorum prae∣ter Catholicos Nagybanyensium usuando∣rum, totali suo exercitio, cultu & Mini∣stris orbare Comitatus item Szathmari∣ensis oppidum Felsóbanya, quod in pos∣sessione & continuo usu sui Templi, acces∣soriorum, & horum proventuum ante, in, & post Diaetam Soproniensem ad annum usque praesentem fuisset: Prout & Comi∣tatus Abauyvariensis aliud oppidum Sep∣sy, in possessione alias templi sui, & om∣nium appertinentiarum vi 26 Articuli So∣proniensis, Membri tertii & sexti reli∣ctum, pariformi abolitione Praedicanti∣um & Scholae Rectorum Evangelicorum, praemissorumque, uti Nagybanyae, stri∣ctissima injunctione integrali corundem exercitio viduare. Aliis plurimis plurium, uti Reverendis∣simorum Matthiae Radonay quinque Ec∣clesiensis Episcopi, & Francisci Jany Pech∣varadiensis Abbatis in superiori & inferio∣ri Barovia circa quinque Ecclesias in Na∣dasdiensibus & Klanyokiensibus Praedican∣tibus, aliisque earundem partium, praeci∣pue in Veresmartiensibus Incolis, supra im∣manitatem fere Turcicam attentatis ex∣cessibus, peculiari memoriali Maiestati ve∣strae Sacratissimae fusius repraesentatis, bre∣vitatis causa hic praeteritis. Cum haec & similia contra tam manife∣stam Articuli hujus constitutionem milita∣rent, nec etiam hoc ipso liberum exerciti∣um esse, aut dici posset, si causa, sine qua non, inhibeatur. Apud Majestatem vestram Sacratissi∣mam quam profundissima humilitate insta∣mus quatenus praescriptorum specifice in Membro primo appositorum, & in hoc quo∣que tertio generaliter commemoratorum Comitatuum & Civitatum optimo & fun∣damentali jure, quod circa admissum libe∣rum Religionis exercitium, vi omnium trium Membrorum Articuli hujus habe∣rent, eodem vero non citra parvam inju∣riam privati essent, clementissime conside∣rato, eosdem & easdem tam quoad exer∣citium reassumendum, quam quoad extur∣batos Praedicantes & Rectores suos rur∣sum recipiendos, non solum integre resti∣tuere, verum in specie praelibatae etiam Civitatis Epperies Evangelicos suos expul∣sos Ministros ad sua munera Ecclesiastica obeunda iterum reducendi, vel loco ho∣rum alios, citra ullam coarctationem & li∣mitationem certi numeri, verum quotquo ob intervenientiam fortuitorum casuum, adhaec frequentiam etiam civium interte∣nere possent, vocandi & surrogandi ple∣nariam potestatem gratiosissime impertiri.
Adhaec memoratae quoque Civitatis Na∣gybania, sicut & praedictorum Felsóbanya & Sepsy oppidorum Evangelicis, illis quidem prohibitum eorundem exercitium cum revocatione ejectorum Praedicantis & Rectoris, ex integro reassumere: His vero adempta sua Templa, Parochias, & Scholas cum accessoriis, & remotis Eccle∣siarum suarum Ministris ac Rectoribus priori suo statui ex vi praemissorum Arti∣cularium suorum jurium rursus restitui facere, benigne demandare, sicque praevi∣is omnibus Articulariter accommodatis ulteriores Regnicolarum & Religionis ex∣ercitiorum turbationes gravi sub animad∣versione & poena per Clementissimum De∣cretum suum ad Universos Comitatus & Civitates missiliter transmittendorum, ac∣cedente Gratia sua Regia, serio inhibere non dedignetur. Contra Quartum Membrum hujus Contextus: Sed neque Augustanae & Helveticae Con∣fessioni addicti ad Caeremonias suae Confessioni contrarias compellantur. Licet Membri quoque hujus Generali∣tas antecedentia confirmaret, clareque in∣ferret, ullius status & conditionis Augu∣stanae & Helveticae Confessioni addictos homines ad Confessioni eorundem ritus contrarios compelli debere. Eo tamen non obstante praeviae Com∣missiones omnes vel maxime Membro pri∣mo allegatas Civitates exercitio Evangeli∣co privatas ad omnes actus Ministeriales ritui ipsorum contrarios amplectendae Re∣ligionis Catholicae causa omnino adigen∣das Plebanis Catholicis indifferenter man∣darunt, ac passim Catholicis gubernia ge∣rentibus Cives & inhabitatores suos, qui∣bus potirentur, potissimum opifices & Me∣chanicos Evangelicos ad Vexillorum Pro∣cessionalium Comparationem, ac ipsas eti∣am processiones, cogendos pronuncia∣runt. Hinc inibi aegrotantibus & agnonizanti∣bus Sacraque Eucharistia uti volentibus Evangelicis nulli Praedicantes ex quibus∣cunque tandem locis permittuntur. Neo∣nati infantes alibi locorum Evangelico∣rum baptizari prohibentur. Puerperae etiam exactis suis Hebdomadibus ab intro∣ductione, copulandi à copulatione, mor∣tui ab inhumatione similium locorum acci∣piendis penitus arcentur, & non admit∣tuntur: Sed praecise Ministerio Parocho∣rum & Plebanorum Catholicorum in his & aliis uti inviti compelluntur. Unde ipsi quoque Domini Patres Jesui∣tae Ann. praeterito 89. circa initium Octo∣bris eo processere licentiae Posonii, quod juniorem Praedicantem Posoniensem Joan∣nem Vider hospitale ejusdem loci, mise∣rae cujusdem provectae alias aetatis, & jam agonizantis feminae Evangelicae consolan∣dae & communicandae causa accedentem cum suo pane foras ire comminatorie prae∣ceperint, ac abinde amandarint, ita ut mi∣sera Mulier sine communione & solatio a∣nimae ultimum suum claudere debuerit diem, nec jam amplius licitum sit tali in casu Praedicantibus Posoniensibus idem Hospitale ingredi, minus diversarum Re∣ligionum copulandas Personas, quarum una Catholica, altera vero Evangelica es∣set copulare: Sed nec talium conjugato∣rum proles baptizare, vel etiam inhuma∣re, sub alioquin citationis ad sedem Me∣trapolitanam Tyrnaviensem Comminati∣one, & gravis poenae incursione per Pa∣rochum Posoniensem iisdem significata. Non absimili Coactionis licentia abuti∣tur quoque modernus Parochus Civitatis Leutschoviensis Casimirus Miners Ord. Praemonstr. praepositus contra ejusdem Ci∣vitatis universos Nobiles pariter & Igno∣biles, cives & incolas Evangelicos, ho∣rumque Praedicantes libero Religionis suae exercitio indultu Articulari alias fruentes, quippe quos à Communione ac omnibus aliis actibus Ministerialibus quibuscunque exteris Evangelicis quocunque tandem modo administrandis, haec omnia sibi ven∣dicans severe arceret. Peregrinos etiam quoscunque Evangelicos copulandos, si, licet Leutschovienses, vel è converso, qui Leutschoviensium alterius loci Evangeli∣cas ducerent uxores, praecise apud se co∣pulandos adigeret. In casu vero funeran∣dorum Evangelicorum ad suas Caeremo∣nias prae demortuorum aedibus suo ritu peragendas, adeoque in deductionibus e∣tiam usque portam Civitatis concomitan∣do capessendas, inconvenientis solutionis exigendae ergo actu cogeret: Insuper co∣piosissimam earundem duarum nationum, Germanicae nimirum admodum frequen∣tis, & Sclavicae in tertialitate Minoris Ec∣clesiam ad duorum saltem ministrorum in∣tertentionem, unicuique nationi unum saltem admittendo, cum Germanicae vix tres sufficerent, auctoritate sua coarcta∣ret. His accederet Comaromii, Gyóngyó∣sini, alibique incolas Evangelicos per Clerum loci, rusticos vero ubique fere
per Regnum tam mandato praemissarum Commissionum Regiarum, quam jussu quorumcunque Dominorum Catholico∣rum Terrestrium, ad frequentationem Catholicorum Templorum, horumque omnium Caeremoniarum & rituum usuati∣onem compelli. Quae quum per omnia huic clarissimae statutioni Articulari adversarentur, Ma∣jestatem vestram Sacratissimam per omnia sibi chara humillime petimus, quatenus relaxatis omnibus praemissis violentis co∣actionibus circa caeremoniarum, rituum, ac Religionum contrariarum usuationem & acceptationem maximo conscientiarum cum gravamine indiscriminatim cuicunque Evangelicorum per quoscunque Dominos Catholicos quocunque modo impositis, a∣bolitis insuper omnibus inhibitionibus, in libero Religionis exercitio qualitercun∣que factis, unicuique fidelium Regnico∣larum suorum Evangelicorum citra ullam Religiosae praescriptionis praescriptionem in hoc vel illo, id vel illud faciendi, aut o∣mittendi, liberum suum exercitium, prout uniuscujusque admitteret conscientia, ex integro ubilibet, libere ad mentem sae∣pe mentionatorum allegatorum Articulo∣rum usuandum & exercendum, ex Caesa∣reo-Regia Gratia & Clementia quam pro∣pensissime concedere dignetur. Secundo, quoad Artic. XXVI. ejusdem Anni & Diaetae, primum Membrum hoc innuit. AD haec templa quoque per Augustanae & Helveticae Confessioni addictos aedifi∣cata, & ritu Catholico necdum reconciliata per certos Commissarios eisdem assignanda. Articulari hac Constitutione quamquam per expressum exstante, ac Evangelicis suis sumptibus aedificata, rituque Catho∣lico necdum reconciliata Templa & Capel∣las excidenda, assignanda, & relinquenda venire pronunciante; Commissiones nihil∣ominus eaedem nullo habito hujus respectu in Comitatu Thurocziensi, in Possessioni∣bus Bella, Zatureza, & Pribocz, similia Templa, & in Comitatu Lyptoviensi in Possessionibus Kirally, Lehota, Pothur∣nya, & Virbieze, similiter Capellas per Evangelicos & Dominos terrestres aedifi∣catas, rituque Catholico ante conditum Articulum necdum reconciliatas, alibique in aliis Comitatibus habitas & repertas, in∣differenter occuparunt, ab earumque usu∣atione & ibidem peragendo cultu Evange∣licos strictissime inhibuerunt, & ad duo saltem loca, uti praememoratum, ubi Templa aedificari permissa sunt, aliquot mille hominum incapacia, imo propter distantiam incongrua, periculosa, diffici∣liaque, relegarunt, & restrinxerunt. Unde tot millium Evangelicorum in Comitatibus potissimum calamitosa, proli dolor! sors eo devinit, ut propter indiffe∣rentem ademptionem Templorum, & amo∣tionem Ministrorum suorum, maximum sine communione, plurimi vero infantes absque baptismate decedant. Quae cum contra permissionem Articu∣larem, & dictamen etiam Communis ju∣stitiae suum cuique tribuentis, Evangelicis essent ablata: Proinde restitutionem & reassignationem talium Templorum & Capellarum ad mentem hujus Membri primi memoratorum Comitatuum, alio∣rumque, Evangelicis pro exercendo Reli∣gionis suae cultu legaliter fiendam à Maje∣state vestra Sacratissima suppliciter peti∣mus. Secundum Membrum hoc decernit. In aliis vero locis juxta benignissimam suae Majestatis Resolutionem loca pro aedificandis Templis, Scholis, & Parochiis erigendis, pro commoditate eorundem Augustanae & Hel∣veticae Confessioni addictorum, per eosdem Commissarios designanda decernuntur. Etsi Constitutio haec loca pro Commo∣ditate Evangelicorum aedificandis novis Templis, Scholis, & Parochiis erigendis omnino commoda & congrua designanda aperte ordinasset, exindeque eaedem Com∣missiones huic ordinationi conformiter, po∣tissimum vero in Regiis, Liberis, & Mon∣tanis Civitatibus, quibus, Templa, Scho∣lae, & Parochiae, aliaque sunt adempta, se accommodare, citraque aliquam exte∣rorum locorum coarctationem, in ipsis Ci∣vitatibus, intraque easdem (juxta genui∣num, fanum, & literalem Articuli etiam hujus sequentis Membri quinti expresse i∣ta sonantium clausularum sensum: Ac tan∣dem in liberis & Montanis Civitatibus, &c. Ac in Superiore Hungaria omnibus itidem Civitatibus, &c. Quae interiora, non ex∣teriora Civitatum loca declararent:) Con∣venientia & commoda loca exscindere & assignare debuissent: Commissio tamen Regia ad Superiores Regni Hungariae par∣tes exmissa, medio Cameraticorum & his adjunctorum hominum inter caeteras Civi∣tates Epperiessini Evangelicis, Germanicae Nationi prope Carnisicis pratum, cada∣veribus
deglubendis destinatum, Hunga∣ricae erga Civitatis patibulum, & Scla∣voniae in Fimeto, locis sane extra desolata Suburbia longe dissitis, campestribus, iis∣que contumeliosis existentibus: Cassoviae vero aeque tribus similibus nationibus pa∣riter extra solo aequatum Suburbium in squalido & summe lutoso campo, ad offi∣cinam tegulariam erga itidem patibulum situatam, constituto maximo Evangelicae Religionis cum despectu erigendorum no∣vorum Templorum, Scholarum, Paro∣chiarumque loca indecentia, & incommo∣da designavit. Quocum ob sacrum etiam finem San∣ctissimo Deo dicanda Templa & accessoria aedificare piaculum omnino esset, adeoque despectuosa hujusmodi designatio praeviae quoque Articulari Sanctioni nimium prae∣judicaret. Pro eo virtute legalis Constitutionis Majestatem vestram Sacratissimam pro Commemoratorum obscoenorum & squali∣dorum, ex privato privatorum quorundam hominum erga Religionem Evangelicam affectu, excisorum locorum totali cassati∣one, aliorum vero commodorum & con∣decentium in iisdem Civitatibus, earum∣que moeniis (ita citra ambiguitatem sensus innuentibus praeallegati hujus Articuli Membri quinti expressis verbis) ubi sat commoda & capacia haberentur loca, ipsis Epperiensibus & Cassoviensibus Evangeli∣cis gratiosissime impertienda excisione & assignatione, devotissima cum subjectione exoramus. Tertium Membrum hoc statuit: In aliis vero Comitatibus, veluti in Szala∣diensi, Veszprimiensi, Jauriensi, Comaromi∣ensi, Abauyvariensi, Saarosiensi, Zemplinien∣si, Ughocziensi, Bereghiensi, Thornensi, Gó∣móriensi, Borsodiensi, Honthensi, Nogradiensi, Szolnok, & Heves, nec non Pest, Pilis, & Soldt unitis? Item Szabolcziensi, Ungh & Szathmariensi, siquidem de praesenti essent in actuali usu omnium fere Templorum ibidem habitorum. Ideo eadem pro actualibus eorun∣dem possessoribus usuanda relicta sunt. Hi de nomine specificati Comitatus (qui omnia sua castra, oppida, & villas, seu possessiones cum omnibus suis Tem∣plis, Sacellis, Oratoriis, Scholis, & Pa∣rochiis involverent) dum etiam juxta ma∣nifestum Membri hujus statutum, prae∣missa ex ratione, quod tempore conditi hujus Articuli in actuali usu omnium fere Templorum & accessoriorum fuissent, in reali possessione, liberoque & pacifico eorun∣dem usu relicti, & caeterum etiam taliter imperturbate relinquendi declarati essent, adeoque ab omnibus quorumcunque oc∣cupationibus Templorum & appertinenti∣arum suorum immunes omnino & integri esse debuissent. Hac tamen Articulari Declaratione posthabita partim saepedictae Commissio∣nes per se, & diversos substitutos Man∣datarios, partim inclytae Camerae, partim Officiales Dominiorum, partim Clerus in plerisque Comitatibus; in Szaladiensi, in Confinio Legrad, in Comaromiensi, in Possessione Mocza, in Abauyvariensi, in Oppidis Regecz, Szanto, Seply, & infe∣riore Meczenzeff; possessionibus item Bodokó, Ujifalu, & Fony, in Saarosiensi, in oppido Saaros, & possessionibus Tólk∣zek, Asgutth, & Sóóvar; in Zemplini∣ensi, in oppidis Thokay, Tarczal, Ke∣reszthur, Maad, Liszha, Thállya, Tol∣zua, Benye, Patak, Borsy, Ujihelly, & Bottyan: In Ugoczensi, in oppido Nagy Szólós: In Bereghiensi, in oppidis Mun∣kacz, Beregszas, Vári, & Berégs: In Tornensi, in possessione Almás: In Hon∣thensi, in Civitatibus, oppidis, & villis existentia Evangelicorum Templa, Paro∣chias, & Scholas, excepto unico exili Templo in contemptissimo pago Drino di∣cto, non tam pridem per Evangelicos ae∣dificato, Evangelicis relicto: In Ungua∣riensi, in oppidis Unguar, Naghy-mihál∣ly, & Vinna, ac Possessione Sztara: In Hevessiensi, in oppidis Gyóngyós, Jasz∣berény, ac possessione Maklár: In Pesti∣ensi, in oppido Vacz, & possessione Thót∣falu: In Szathmariensi, in oppido Felsó∣banya, & possessione Giroth-Thótfalu, & Tarpa, aliisque, Evangelicorum Templa, Parochias, & Scholas violenter occupa∣runt, amotisque eorundem Ministris totali Religionis suae exercitio privare praesump∣serunt, ut ut praerecensiti Comitatus Arti∣culariter in possessione praemanibus habi∣torum praescriptorum Templorum relicti fuissent. Quorum inconveniens occupatio, cum similiter Articulari huic adversaretur sta∣tuto, Majestatisque vestrae Sacratissimae Regio Indultui, quapropter Majestatem vestram Sacratissimam pro effectiva prae∣specificatis in Comitatibus, eorundemqué denominatis oppidis & possessionibus oc∣cupatorum Templorum, Parochiarum, & Scholarum, prioribus suis possessoribus Evangelicis ex attributo jure fienda resti∣tutione & reassignatione, qua possumus a∣nimi devotione supplices oramus.

Quamquam vi Concessionis hujus evi∣dens esset, Augustanae & Helveticae Con∣fessioni addictis in praedenominatis Con∣finiis liberi Exercitii, & Templorum, ac Accessoriorum ibidem habitorum, tem∣poreque hujus conditi Articuli possesso∣rum realem usum relictum, & stabilitum esse: Regia nihilominus Commissio ad Infe∣riores Regni Hungariae partes Ann. 1688. ordinata, Carponae de nomine hoc in Membro specificata Civitate, occupatis Templo, Parochia, & Schola Evangelicis, remotisque Praedicantibus & Scholae do∣centibus, totale exercitium à memoria ho∣minum ibidem continuo usu libere semper practicatum & habitum, ac etiam eodem in usu praevio modo Articulariter reli∣ctum, maximo exercitii Spiritualis nul∣lam moram patientis cum praejudicio, opti∣mique juris Articularis, verbo & indulto Regio confirmati, derogamine severa cum Comminatione inhibuit, & eodem peni∣tus abstinere universos Nobiles & Igno∣biles ibidem habitantes, qua praesidiarios, qua incolas, & Cives Evangelicos coegit, eosdem ad ulteriorem Majestatis vestrae Sacratissimae benignissimam eatenus obti∣nendam Resolutionem & Gratiam rele∣gando. Comaromii porro, ubi pariter vi hujus Articuli libera Augustanae & Helveticae Confessionis exercitii praxis, quam etiam parium duorum Templorum, Parochia∣rum & Scholarum pacifica possessio & usus esset confirmata, in iis utriusque Confessi∣onis incolae, stipendiarii item milites Hungarici, ibidem existentes imperturba∣te ad fatales usque praeteritorum Anno∣rum belli tumultus, & insperatam, Ann. 1683. totius ejusdem oppidi, Templo∣rum, Parochiarum, & Scholarum Confla∣grationem perstitissent; ob praefatos vero casus tam Civibus Evangelicis, quam eo∣rum Ministris hinc inde dispersis, tale li∣berum exercitium Religionis quodammodo intermitti contigisset, dum supervenienti∣bus jam fatis clementioribus dispersi E∣vangelici rursum rediissent, ac virtute praescripti hujus Articuli publicum Religi∣onis suae exercitium reassumere, Praedi∣cantesque & Scholae docentes suos redu∣cere, Templa adhaec, & Parochias, & Scholas, in consuetis suis de facto desola∣tis exstantibus locis reaedificare voluissent, ac etiamnum vellent, per Excellentiss.

Quintum Membrum hoc constituit: Ac tandem in liberis & Montanis Civita∣tibus, ut pote Trenchiniensi, Modrensi, Crem∣nieziensi, & Novizoliensi, ac in Superiore Hungaria omnibus itidem Civitatibus, simi∣liter loca pro aedificandis Templis, Scholis, & Parochiis assignanda conceduntur. Quid hinc clarius & directius inferri potest, quam quod in singulis liberis & Montanis quoque Civitatibus (quales sunt ordinis sui gratiae recensendae, in Inferiore Hungaria liberae Civitates: Sopronium, Kuszeginum, Rust, Posonium, Szent-Gyorginum, Bazinga, Modra, Tyrnavia, Szakoliza, Trenczinium, Veterozolium, Carpona, & Brezna; & in Superiore, Cassovia, Leutschovia, Bartpha, Epperies, Cibinium, Késmarck, & Nagybanya: In Montanis vero, Neozolium, Schemnic∣zium, Cremniczium, Libethbanya, Ba∣kabanya, Belobanya, & Ujibanya) pro quarum modalitate (reflexione habita ad antecedentis Articuli 25. primi Membri, inibique citatorum Articulorum praemis∣sam generalitatem permissae libertatis fu∣sius deductam, quo se hic Paragraphus quoque referret) distinctione & diversita∣te quadam, proque exemplo, ex utroque ordine liberarum videlicet Inferioris Hun∣gariae binae, uti Trenchinium & Modra; & Montanarum similiter binae, nempe Cremniczium & Neozolium Civitates re∣censentur, & denominantur, Superiorum vero Hungariae liberarum Civitatum ge∣nerifica fieret mentio, dum omnes una eademque libertatis praerogativa perfru∣crentur, nec conditio unius sequior esset alterius, similiter loca commoda, & qui∣dem in Civitatibus ipsis, sive in medio ipsarum, ad genuinam mentem verborum Membri hujus: In Liberis & Montanis Ci∣vitatibus, &c. In Superiore Hungaria: Om∣nibus itidem Civitatibus, &c. Quae non spe∣cificatae etiam à libertatis suae generalitate hic sano sensu intellecta, & comprehensa¦ion excluderent aedificandis Templis, Pa∣rochiis, & Scholis assignanda venirent. Commissiones vero Regiae extra attacto hoc Membro quinto denominatas Civita∣tes, reliquas omnes quatuordecim Liberas & Montanas Civitates à designatione & excisione locorum excluserunt, omnique exercitio, & quidem adhuc cum certa (ut Superius in Articuli 25. Membro primo repraesentatum) incancellatione priva∣runt. In Superiore porro Hungaria potissi∣mum Epperiessini & Cassoviae plane abo∣minanda loca (ut Membro praecedenti secundo repraesentatum) designarunt. Quae quum cum sancito hujus Articuli, & ad initium Membri primi Art. 25. alle∣gatorum, horumque recto sensu, adeo∣que ipsa etiam sana ratione non conveni∣rent, nixi ob id talibus fundamentis Ar∣ticularibus Majestatem vestram Sacratissi∣mam pari gratiosissima uti caeteris Deno∣minatis, ita praedeclaratis, non specifica∣tis, hincque ex missis & restrictis Civitati∣bus, locorum commodorum aedificando∣rum novorum Templorum, Parochiarum, & Scholarum deservientium demonstrati∣one, liberique Religionis eorundem exer∣citii, cum & alias tali benignissimo Indultu Regio ipsis etiam, uti aliis libere perfrui fas omnino & aequum esset, nec eodem quoquo modo privari deberent integra ad∣missione; praeattactis vero Cassoviensi & Epperiensi Civitatibus aliorum, ob sa∣crum finem Deo dedicandorum convenien∣tium locorum intra casdem Civitates, Sub∣urbiis plane carentes, reperibilium desig∣natione & assignatione fiendis, perquam humillime rogamus. Sextum Membrum hoc sancit: Templa demum, in quorum actuali possessione idem Augustanae & Helveticae Confessioni ad∣dicti de facto sunt, modo praevio prae manibus eorundem, una cum Parochiis & Scholis, pro∣ventibusque eorundem propter bonum Pacis, ut nimium quiete & pacifice vivant, relinquun∣tur, usu Sepulturae & Campanarum pro Ca∣tholicis ibidem degentibus aeque ac ipsis re∣licto. Quam evidens etiam esset hoc Mem∣brum sextum, antecedensque hujus Arti∣culi tertium explicatiori declaratione E∣vangelicos in actuali & pacifica Templo∣rum, Parochiarum, Scholarum, & pro∣ventuum suorum, prae manibus, tempore hujus conditi Articuli habitorum possessi∣one, Campanarum insuper & Sepulturae Communi usu relictos, & relinquendos stabiliret, & confirmaret. Eo tamen repudiaro tam memoratae Commissiones Regiae, quam inclytae quo∣que camerae, & officiales quique, prout & Clerus, in Comitatibus, praescripto Membro tertio fusius enumeratis, talia Templa una cum Appertinentiis & Pro∣ventibus universis, contra dictamen hujus Articuli, occuparunt, & haec concomitan∣tia, liberum nimirum exercitium, & fun∣ctionem Ministerialem, ejectis Ministris, prohibuerunt, Campanarum etiam & Se∣pultura
communem Usum fere ubique E∣vangelicis interdixerunt. Sic exemplificandi caussa Commissio Regia in Comitatu Honthensi, qui unus esset ex praescriptis Membro tertio enume∣ratis, quive tam ex vi hujus sexti, quam etiam praefati tertii Membrorum à simili Commissione immunis esse debebat, omnia Templa, unico excepto, eoque parvulo Mediante Vice-Comite ejusdem Comita∣tus occupari, & Praedicantes amoveri fe∣cit. Ita in Comitatu Hevessiensi Mandati∣one Reverendissimi Domini Archiepiscopi Strigoniensis Georgii Szeckenii, & Illu∣strissimi Dom. Comitis Georgii Erdódii oppidum Gyóngyós Helveticae Confessi∣onis, qui in continua semper possessione Templi, Parochiae, & Scholae, Accesso∣riorumque ipsorum à longis temporibus Ante, in, & post Diaetam Soproniensem fuerant, iis una cum omnibus suis piis legatis & proventibus, undecim praecipu∣is vineis, quinque Molendinis, uno Ma∣cello, & una Domo, adhaec aliquot cente∣nis urnis vini per Joannem Almasy Heves∣siensis, & Franciscum Sutter Pestiensis Co∣mitatuum judices Nobilium die 22 Maii, Ann. 1688. sunt privati, amotioneque Ec∣clesiae, & Scholae docentium, totali eo∣rundem Evangelico exercitio, etiam in privatis aedibus continuando, prout & Se∣pultura ac Campanarum usu inhibiti, pos∣sessione horum omnium Clero loci tra∣dita. Pariter in Comitatibus Abauyvariensi & Zempliniensi, signanter in Dominio Ra∣gocziano, oppida Thallya, Máád, Szán∣tó, Kcreszthur, Tarczal, Liszka, Bennye, Tolchva, Patak, Ujihelly, Borsy, Regacz, & Thokay, aliaque, quae aeque in actuali & pacifico Dominio Templorum, Schola∣rum, Parochiarum, & accessoriorum, ho∣rumque proventuum, tam ante hunc con∣ditum Articulum, quam conditionis ejus∣dem Tempore fuissent, de caeteroque prae∣possessione horum relinqui debuissent, om∣nibus his per officiales ejusdem Dominii sunt privata, ac libero Religionis exerci∣tio, vel in privata etiam Domo usuando, severissimis sub minis inhibita. Non absimilitet in Civitatibus Cassovi∣ensi & Epperiensi quoad proventus Eccle∣siasticos omnia Evangelicorum pia lega∣ta; Cassoviensibus quidem quatuor Do∣mus, unus adhaec hortus, certae item ter∣rae arabiles, & in promontorio Tokay una vinea Varga dicta; Epperiensibus vero certae insimul vineae, diversis in Pro∣montoriis partium Superiorum situatae cum suis reditibus, per Magistratum loci Ca∣tholicum utrobique via facti sunt ereptae: Quibus Campanarum quoque & Sepultu∣rae communis usus absolute denegatur. Funerum adhaec intra moenia Civitatum cum solitis suis caeremoniis condecens de∣ductio etiam cavetur, & non admitti∣tur. Quibus similibus cum expresse contra Artic. hunc injuriati essent memoratorum locorum Evangelici. Exinde Sanctissimae eatenus declaratae Majestatis vestrae Sacratissimae Resolutio∣ni & Articulari Concessioni firmiter inhae∣rentes, à Majestate vestra Sacratissima ho∣rum omnium, & praeattacto etiam Mem∣bro tertio Commemoratorum Comitaten∣sium locorum occupatorum Evangelicos praecise concernentium Templorum, Pa∣rochiaram, Scholarum, & accessoriorum, omnium adhaec legatorum, indeque sub∣secutorum proventuum, campanarum item ac Sepulturae usum, contra mentem hujus Articuli & Membri violenter ademptorum, suis antiquis possessoribus Evangelicis re∣ali cum effectu fiendam benignissimam Re∣stitutionem & redintegrationem de genu flexo desideramus. Septimum Membrum determinat: Interea vero nec Catholici Ministris Augu∣stinae & Helveticae Confessioni addictis, nec vero horum sequaces Plebanis Catholicis ad mentem Articuli undecimi 1647. solvere obli∣gentur. Hujus Membri statutione clarissima licet, & perconfirmati etiam Artic. 11. 1647. per expressa verba: Ne Evangelici status Catho∣licis Plebanis, & è converso status Catholici Evangelicis Ministris ad ullas solutiones prae∣standas sint obligati: Imo subsequentis Articuli 12. ejus∣dem Ann. 1647. explicatiora: Ubi vero Parochias non haberent auditores Evangelici, solutionem pendant suae Religionis Ministris, cujus videlicet Ministerio, seu opera, usi fue∣rint: Sicut & Catholici Parochis Catholicis. Ubi autem auditores Evangelici hactenus non solvissent plebanis Catholicis, imposterum eti∣am ad nullas solutiones praestandas ullo sub prae∣textu cogantur ad solvendum, prout nec Ca∣tholici Evangelicis. Adhaec quoad Stolarum proventus & pensiones allegati 12 Articuli Ann. 1647. immediate subsequentia formalia:
Stolares autem proventus, seu solutiones, in quibusvis locis Plebani Catholici & Mini∣stri Evangelici à suae Religionis auditoribus totaliter percipiant: Adhuc magis elucida∣tiore existente, ac unicuique partium con∣venientes suas pensiones attribuente, ade∣oque Evangelicos ab omni prorsus soluti∣onis obligamine, Clero & Plebanis Ca∣tholicis fienda absolute exemptos pronun∣ciante. Minus tamen nihilo Commissiones Re∣giae ubique in Comitatibus (extra duo saltem in quovis Comitatu designata loca) omnes solutiones Plebanis Catholicis ad∣dixerunt: In Civitatibus vero, ubi etiam liberum exercitium permissum, ut ex Fi∣sco, seu Communi Civitatum aerario (ad quem respectu pluralitatis Evangelicorum Catholici minimum quantum contribue∣rent) ipsis Plebanis, seu Parochis Catho∣licis solutio fiat, & Evangelici tam Mini∣stris, quam etiam Scholae doctoribus suis extraordinarie ex propriis prospiciant, contra praescriptum manifestum Articulum constituerunt, cui abusivae Constitutioni ubilibet locorum ipsi Plebani & Clerus po∣tenter insisterent, & via facti quaslibet so∣lutiones, ac universos stolares proventus pro se indifferenter tam in Comitatibus, quam etiam omnibus Civitatibus exige∣rent. Inde Officiales etiam saepe fati Dominii Rakocziani in Superiori Hungaria indi∣scriminatim nobiles pariter, & ignobiles Evangelicos brachio quoque militari ad solutionem Plebanis in eodem Dominio pendendam omni conatu adigunt. Quae cum contra positivam Articuli hu∣jus determinationem facta essent, adeoque cum maximo etiam ejusdem & inibi allega∣torum abusu per Plebanos Catholicos erga Evangelicos universim practicaren∣tur. Inde hoc in passu ad praescriptum Arti∣culum & suas leges provocantes apud Majestatem vestram Sacratissimam demis∣sissime instamus, quatenus virtute harum omnes Evangelicos ab omni prorsus solu∣tione Parochis Catholicis praestanda im∣munes pronunciare, ac ut quilibet status suos sibi servientes interteneat, & exsol∣vat, iisdem etiam suos pendat stolares pro∣ventus, Clementissima, justitiaeque con∣sona ordinatione decernere dignetur. Octavum Membrum hoc ordinat: Omnibus porro Magnatibus & Nobilibus in Regno degentibus, in Arcibus & solitis Residentiis, pro ritu cujusvis Professionis, Ora∣toria & Sacella exstruere, & dotare liberum sit. Virtute membri hujus licet omnibus Magnatibus & Nobilibus Evangelicis in Ar∣cibus & residentiis suis Oratoria & Sacel∣la exstruendi & dotandi permissa sit liber∣tas, quae liberam omnino in iis Religionis suae professionem, sacrorum & accessorio∣rum celebrationem, Ministrorum item intertentionem, tanquam causam sul Principalem, & sine qua non, respicerent, & secum ferrent; alioquin absque his elu∣soria plane & supervacanea foret haec Arti∣cularis Concessio. Praetitulatae tamen Commissiones Regiae praxin hanc post occupationem Templo∣rum vi praescriptae Articularis Ordinatio∣nis per Comitatus in Arcibus & Residen∣tiis Magnatum & Nobilium longo tem∣pore usitatam & acceptatam, in pleris∣que Comitatibus, signanter Lyptoviensi, Turocziensi, Arvensi, Trenchiniensi, Zo∣lensi, Honthensi, aliisque totaliter inhi∣buerunt, & contra praeinsinuatum sanum Articuli sensum in similibus locis liberum Religionis suae exercitium per peculiares Ministros exercendum penitus vetarunt, & nonnisi (quod si celebratione cultus sui in Residentiis suis uti vellent) alterutrius duorum designatorum in Comitatu loco∣rum Ministri, nullatenus vero alterius ac∣cersendi, & ejus opera utendi, hoc que e∣tiam praecise, per cujusque propria & fa∣miliae suae, non vero ullorum vicinorum necessitate, sub poena alioquin militaris in∣vasionis similis Praesidentiae facultate ad∣missa, Articularem hanc libertatem mira circumscriptione coarctarunt. Unde in Comitatu Lyptoviensi Parochi & Plebani aliquot talium, Nobilium Do∣mos per Milites Arcis Lykava invadi & expilari curarunt. In Comitatu Trenchiniensi Anno prae∣terito 89 Nobiles Familiae Nozdrovizky Praedicantes in residentia sua pro admini∣stratione exercitii sui intertenentes, simi∣liter instinctu Plebanorum per milites Re∣giminis Mersiani damnificati sunt, Mini∣stro ad carceres Arcis Lednicze raptato, & strictissima incarceratione ad subscripti∣onem summe praejudiciosarum Reversali∣um pro sui eliberatione adacto.
Quae cum directe repugnarent praeatta∣ctae legalitati, nec etiam Magnates & No∣biles (quibus tamquam Secundi & Tertii Liberorum Statuum & Ordinum Regni, liberis personis, liberum suum exercitium ubique, sive in propriis Residentiis, sive in fundis suis, sive sub Dio, aeque libere, intertentione, si modo potuerint, & usu Ministerii exercere liberum esset, Religiosa hac eorundem, eaque Articulari in liber∣tate restringi quirent. Quocirca apud Majestatem vestram Sa∣cratissimam pro relaxatione, & sublatione praeviae Commissionalis inhibitionis, & circumscriptionis, è converso juxta indul∣tum hujus Articuli, ejusdemque sanam mentem, omnibus Magnatibus & Nobili∣bus in Regno, in Capellis, & Oratoriis eorundem Arcensibus & Residentialibus, per quoscunque peculiares Ministros, quos intertenere possent, liberi exercitii, omniumque Accessoriorum, quibuslibet Regnicolis libere exercendi gratiosissima admissione ardentissime efflagitamus. Nonum Membrum hoc perhibet: Posthac vero nullae Templorum, Scholarum∣que & Parochiarum occupationes, vel Exer∣citii turbationes ab utrimque, sub poena in Articulo 8 Uladislai decreto 5, expressa, fiant. Expressa lege licet cautum sit, (quoli∣bet Regni statu propter bonum Pacis & Tranquillitatem Regni publicam in prae∣scriptis suis Articularibus terminis posses∣sionum Templorum, Scholarum, Paro∣chiarum, liberique Religionis suae exerci∣tii relicto) amplius quaeque Templa, Scholas, & Parochias Evangelicorum oc∣cupare, horumque libera exercitia quo∣que quoquo modo interturbare; Non tamen desiit, sed ne nunc quidem desinit Status Catholicus eatenus miseros Evangelicos indiscriminatim per totum Regnum exquisitis sub coloribus (ut jam supra fusius repraesentatum) per vim & fortia, citra ullius poenae formidinem & incursum impune sane infestare, eosque religiosa eorundem legitima privare. Quare si contra eundem tamquam prae∣missis manifestissime contravenientem ef∣fectiva designatae poenae desumptione pro∣cederetur, polliceretur equidem status E∣vangelicus sibimet in praemissis pacificam & imperturbatam permansionem, tollere∣turque omnis dissidiorum fomes. Quae cum non siant, quantumcunque nobis etiam lamentantibus, querulantibus, & injurias nostras repraesentantibus, cir∣caque harum sublationem, & nostri ac∣commodationem, Articularem Medelam implorantibus, crevit exinde, & adhuc∣dum crescit status Catholici eo liberior in nos grassandi audacia, contraque omne jus & aequum libertatibus nostris nos ex∣uendi licentia. Hinc ut tales & similes violentae occu∣pationes & interturbationes praemissorum omnimode praecaveantur, praescriptam le∣gem strictissime contra transgressores prae∣vios, ac etiam futuros quoslibet suis viis & modis observandam, & prosequendam iri à Majestate vestra Sacratissima solli∣cite petimus. Accederet praemissis quoque adjun∣gendum quoad Libertatem vel Maxime Civilem Politicam. ARticulo 11. Soproniensi praememo∣ratae novissimae diaetae gratiosissima Regiarum & liberarum, Montanarumque Civitatum Communium privilegiorum confirmatione, desuperque ibidem allegata∣rum, & passim conditarum Legum reno∣vatione per expressa verba: Liberarum quoque, ac Regiarum, Monta∣narumque Civitatum non exiguae fuissent que∣relae, quod in jure liberae electionis Magistra∣tus Civilis, necnon jure patronatus, &c. ac aliis suis immunitatibus, partim à parte Ca∣merae Hungariae, partim vero ab Officialibus bellicis contra privilegia ipsorum, & regni le∣ges, turbatae & impeditae exstitissent; ideo confirmatis eatenus ipsorum privilegiis & im∣munitatibus, &c. Articuli etiam Regni, ut sunt Anni 1659. Art. 129. 1649. Artic. 16. 1647. Art. 83. 1638. Art. 35. ac alii su∣perinde conditi renovantur, ac tam per Ca∣meras, quam Officiales bellicos, ac alios quos∣cunque strictissime observentur, neque in libero Magistratus Civilis jure, ac aliis privilegiis ipsorum longo usu roboratis à quopiam quoquo modo turbentur. Constitutum esse easdem leges, & Ar∣ticulos, tam per Camerales & Bellicos Officiales, quam quoscunque etiam Reg∣nicolas ex omni parte servandos venire, id quod ex consensu omnium & Catholi∣corum & Evangelicorum aequali in usum quoque deductum erat per Civitates.
Nihilominus praevia Excelsarum Com∣missionum, ut superius memoratum, in omnibus Regiis, Liberis & Montanis Civi∣tatibus Evangelicorum amovendorum, & Catholicorum in Magistratum surrogan∣dorum Nomine Majestatis vestrae Sacra∣tissimae Regio facta praescriptione, vel maxime in superioribus partium Regni Hungariae Civitatibus, Cassioviensi, Ep∣periensi, Bartphensi, aliisque inclytae Ca∣merae Scepusiensis inde sumptae occasionis ingessione, praecitato alias Articulo 83. 1647. &c. prohibita, eo processit dictarum Civitatum Magistratus reformatus Catho∣licus licentiae, ut jam omnes Cassovienses, Epperienses, & Bartphenses, aliosque, tam in Senatorii, quam Communitatis ordinum Evangelicos, ad publica Officia, & dignitates Civiles gerendas bene meri∣tos & aptos, ex mero duntaxat privato affectu erga Religionem contra manifestas praefati Articuli, ibique citatorum, signan∣ter Articulorum 13. 1608. ante Corona∣tionem, item 44. 1609, ac 12. 1647. an∣norum Constitutiones, notabili Evange∣licorum cum oppressione, à publicis dig∣nitatibus, honoribus, & officiis civilibus removerit, & horum loco aut minus ido∣neos, aut obaeratos, aut negotia Civita∣tum nihil intelligentes, magisque privata curantes Catholicos summa dictarum Ci∣vitatum cum ruina & damnificatione sur∣rogaverit, & constituerit. Quae siquidem cum apertissimo Con∣firmatarum Communium Libertatum, & privilegiorum civilium praejudicio facta essent, ac fierent impraesentiarum, Quamobrem, Primo, Majestati vestrae Sacratissimae, pro liberi Magistratus & Communitatis Civilis eligendi juris, hactenus, ut jam praeinsinuatum, diversimode per diversos interturbati, ac ex parte Evangelicorum penitus eversi, unice & mere penes eas∣dem ac quascunque Civitates, earumque utriusque Religionis Catholicae & Evan∣gelicae Juratos benemeritos Cives perma∣nendi priori suo statui admittenda redu∣ctione, solidaque conservatione.

Et haec sunt, Sacratissime Imperator, inter caetera praevio modo Articulariter Sancitarum, & ad genuinum ac litera∣lem Articulorum Soproniensium sen∣sum membratim perspicue deductarum Religiosae & Politicae libertatum nostra∣rum consensu totius Regni permissa bene∣ficia: Quae quum ita clara & illustria, ut nul∣lam explanationem patiantur, nisi quis il∣los Articulos manifeste obscurare velit, & nos cum reservata juxta etiam praecitati Articuli 26. Soproniensis ultimam clausu∣lam: Per hancque Articularem Concessionem iis∣dem Augustanae & Helveticae Confessioni ad∣dictis ulterior praetensionum suarum via in futuris diaetis instantias suas promovendi (non obstantibus Cleri & aliorum secularium Catho∣licorum contradictionibus) minime praeclu∣datur.

IN recenti Caesareae ac Regiae Majestatis vestrae memoria est, quid nos a. d. 6/16 Januar. cum ad Caesariam & Regiam Majestatem vestram publice admissi esse∣mus, nomine utriusque Electoris Saxonici & Brandeburgici, Dominorum nostrorum Clementissimorum, inter alia de Caesareae ac Regiae Majestatis vestrae Regni Haeredita∣rii & Provinciarum incolis Evangelicis sub∣mississime proposuerimus; & inprimis de libera toties ab universis Evangelicis Or∣dinibus invictis argumentis repetita Tef∣ferekensium ita appellatorum incolarum emigratione, & in Feriolensi ditione re∣tentorum infelicium liberorum restitutio∣ne, liberoque discessu permittendo, hu∣millimis precibus petierimus. Quemad∣modum igitur Clementissimi Domini no∣stri, ambo praefati Electores, certam illam spem de Caesareae & Regiae Majestatis ve∣strae Christianissimo benignissimoque ani∣mo conceperunt, fore, ut Caesarea ac Re∣gia Majestas vestra submississimis hisce

Quapropter justissimis Caesareae ac Regiae Majestatis vestrae ocu∣lis rursus eorundem infelicium in Hunga∣ria Evangelicorum Miserrimum statum, novis indies oppressionibus aggravatum, uti ex annexis liquebit, humillime subji∣cere ausi sumus, nulli dubitantes, quin Caesarea ac Regia Majestas vestra, quae Divini nobis in terris Numinis imago est, afflictorum tacta miseratione, qui suppli∣citer Caesareae ac Regiae Majestatis vestrae throno advoluti sunt, infelicium illorum preces clementissime acceptura, & miseri∣am sublevatura sit: Simul & gratiosissime imperatura, atque curatura, ne nupero Recessu de integro Confirmatum liberum Religionis Evangelicae exercitium, contra Caesareae ac Regiae Majestatis vestrae Cle∣mentissimam animi intentionem, amplius laedatur, interrumpaturque: Verum con∣tra ea suae cujusque conscientia libertati, tranquillitatique permittatur, atque resti∣tuatur: Ipsi vero gravaminibus suis, prae∣sertim ratione abusus clausulae: Salvo jure Dominorum terrestrium, (quae quidem querelarum praecipua caussa est) liberen∣tur, atque exsolvantur. Quamvis autem Clementissimae istius Resolutionis (pro qua interim humillimas gratias agimus) Clementissimorum Dominorum nostrorum Electorum nomine explicationes aliquot obscurioris sensus demississime rogare ha∣beamus, his tamen ad tempus postpositis, illud praecipue obnixis precibus à Caesarea ac Regia Majestate vestra petimus, humil∣liméque obsecramus, ut, quoniam res li∣quida & clara est, atque celeberrimae ex∣peditionis, concessam gratiosissime emi∣grationem Tefferkensium liberorum decla∣rare dignetur, miserisque parentibus libe∣ros suos devehere ipsis liceat, remque su∣am familiarem expedire, concessis in hunc finem, quae requiruntur, literis commea∣tus: Utque hac ratione vinculum illud na∣turae sanctissimum, quod parentes liberis & hos illis, mutuo nexu adstrinxit, inte∣grum, illaesumque conservetur. Quae res uti Electoribus Dominis nostris Clemen∣tissimis longe Maximani animi allatura est voluptatem, ita eosdem magis magisque devinciet, atque Caesareae ac Regiae Maje∣stati vestrae obstrictos reddet, velut suam ipsorum in gratiam concessa, omnibusque submississimae venerationis & obsequii offi∣ciis rependenda. Nos autem pro nostri muneris debita obedientia humillima cum veneratione perpetuum erimus Caesareae Regiae Majestati vestrae Devotissimi & Humillimi Elect. Sax. & Brandenb. Plenipot. Legati, N. E.

QUEMADMODUM res à Cae∣sarea ac Regia Majestate vestra in Hungaria adversus Christiani nominis hostem felicissime gestae, recuperataeque post tam diuturnum sub barbaro jugum regnum illud, nemini plus voluptatis at∣tulerunt, quam clementissimis Dominis nostris Electoribus, caeterisque etiam Im∣perii Rom. Ordinibus ac statibus Evan∣gelicis laetissimo fuere gaudio: Praesertim quod & ipsi pro viribus ad tutandam Cae∣sareae ac Regiae Majestatis vestrae magni∣tudinem arma sua Caesareis enixissime conjunxerint, quo Divina favente gratia, prout hoc summum ipsorum votum est, barbarus ad accipiendam decoram Nomini Caesareo, certamque & constantem Pacem constringatur, cogaturque: Ita & ulterius hoc suum votum extendunt, ut Caesareae ac Regiae Majestatis vestrae indefesso & pa∣trio erga sibi subditos amore, nobilissimum illud regnum in pristinum restituatur flo∣rem, vigoremque: Subditisque illius in∣colis fidelissimis atque obedientissimis ju∣stissimo Caesareae ac Regiae Majestatis ve∣strae imperio atque patrocinio, quoad privilegiorum immunitatumque veterum conservationem ad spem optimam excita∣tis, multo quam antehac firmius & tutius cum Caesareae ac Regiae Majestatis vestrae provinciis, tum Imperio Rom. sive potius universo orbi Christiano sit propugnacu∣lum. Quoniam vero Caesarea ac Regia Majestas vestra hunc in finem jam Ann. 1681. & 87. in Comitiis Soproniensibus & Posoniensibus optima tranquillitatis
publicae jecit fundamenta, neque ullum dubium est, quin, si Caesarea ac Regia Majestas vestra pro cognitissima sua Gra∣tia ac justitia illud solummodo praestare dignetur, ut ibidem conclusi, conventi, atque concessi Articuli, praesertim quoad liberum Religionis Evangelicae exercitium, & illius cultores incolas, ab delegatis in eam rem Commissariis & Ministris bona side observentur, neque vel per ipsos, vel per ipsis succedaneos, tam Ecclesiasticos, quam feculares (uti proh dolor! gravissi∣mis comminationibus nonnulli eorum mi∣serrimos Evangelicos contra Caesareae ac Regiae Majestatis vestrae clementissima jus∣sa, decreta, atque interdicta multimodis ac saepissime terruere) violentur; propo∣situm bonum pacis, tranquillitatisque reg∣ni publicae feliciter subsecuturum sit: Me∣morati ambo Domini nostri Clementissi∣mi Electores, etiam nunc eum in finem, sicut & saepe antea ab aliis factum Imperii Ordinibus Evangelicis, nobis in mandatis dederunt, uti dictos eorundem sacrorum participes Hungaros Caesareae ac Regiae Majestati vestrae humillime commendare∣mus, atque pro iis apud Caesaream ac Regiam Majestatem vestram intercedere∣mus. Qui quidem Domini nostri Cle∣mentissimi eam in Caesareae ac Regiae Ma∣jestatis vestrae innata lenitate atque justi∣tia spem & fiduciam collocarunt, ut non dubitent, quin Caesarea ac Regia Majestas vestra quietem publicam, (quae in cau∣sa Religionis in eodem Regno secundum Regni Constitutiones hactenus satis tran∣quilla & immota fuit, verum pauculos ante annos turbari, laedique coepta est) cultoribus Evangelicae Religionis sartam tectamque praestitura sit, libertatemque conscientiae integram & illaesam, Ecclesi∣as, Scholas, exercitium Religionis pub∣licum, inviolata cunctis & singulis per∣missura, insultus ac violationes severissi∣ma coercitura, & insimul Evangelicorum Electorum, Principum, atque Ordinum in recuperando, & à Turcico jugo libe∣rando Regno Hungarico lubentissimis ani∣mis navatam fidelissimam operam, sub∣missaque valida auxilia, clementissima re∣spicere atque considerare dignatura sit. Praecipue vero Clementissimorum Domi∣norum nostrorum Electorum deprecatio in hunc scopum collimat, ut, quum Cae∣sarea ac Regia Majestas vestra hac & aliis de causis Regios delegabit Commissarios, istiusmodi ilios cum mandatis delegare dignetur, quae ipsos clementissimam exse∣qui Caesareae ac Regiae Majestatis vestrae voluntatem, sanctamque observare justi∣tiam cogant, neque suis servire affecti∣bus, Zolumque Religionis summo cum rigore, saevitiaque, adversus afflictos E∣vangelicos exserere permittant. Hanc Caesareae & Regiae Majestatis vestrae gra∣tiam, ac favorem summum, Clementissi∣mi Domini nostri Electores plurimo cum animi solatio, voluptateque accepturi sunt, summaque fide atque devotione constantissima, caeterisque gratae mentis demonstrationibus ostensuri, nihil sibi à Caesarea & Regia Majestate vestra gratius accidere potuisse. Nos autem, quae no∣stra est tenuitas, submississime atque hu∣millime nosmet profitemur Caesareae ac Regiae Majestati vestrae Devotissimos & Obedientissimos Sereniss. D. D.

ANNEXA. EA species est Ann. 1681. in Comitiis Soproniensibus per Catholicum sta∣tum, insciis tamen Evangelicis, de nego∣tio Religionis conditorum, & per ipsos Ar∣ticulis quoque Diaetalibus insertorum du∣orum Articulorum 25. & 26, ac si hac ra∣tione Evangelicis Hungariae Regni inco∣lis, aliquot mille Ecclesiarum, Scholarum, & appertinentiarum ereptione nulla facta foret injuria, verum potius res grata & accepta, plurium locorum enumeratione ac designatione in quibus liberum ipsis Religionis exercitium concederetur. Quod si vero iidem ad Meridianum solem inspi∣ciantur, & justa exactaque rationis truti∣na expendantur, minus ipso nihilo Hun∣garis concessum videbitur, permissumve, nisi, quae sequitur, damnosissima clausula cum illius interpretatione & extensione reapse inde deleatur, tollaturque. Quid∣quid enim Concessum videtur, per Cleri & Dominorum Catholicorum exoticam in∣terpretationem, & potissimum nimium praejudiciose in totale Evangelicorum, eo∣rundemque Evangelici Exercitii extermi∣nium adjectam clausulam: Salvo jure Do∣minorum Terrestrium: (Contra quam clau∣sulam tamen Evangelici proceres prima
vice Sopronii, atque post illa in Comitiis Posoniensibus omnibus modis protestati sunt: Protestationem vero hanc ultimam Hungaricus Personalis D. Stephanus Ur∣banus, contra quam ipsum decuit, non admisit:) Omnino subversum, & irritum factum est. Nam licet dictorum Sopro∣niensium Comitiorum 25 Articulus ge∣neraliter, & in universum liberum Evan∣gelicae Religionis exercitium cunctis & singulis permittat, nec huic, illíve loco al∣liget, aut adstringat, verum potius ad mentem confirmatae pacificationis Vien∣nensis Ann. 1661. Artic. 1. & praecipue Ann. 1608. itidem Artic. 1. ante Corona∣tionem (qui in memorato 25 Art. Comi∣tiorum Sopròniensium confirmati sunt) omnibus & ubique per Regnum, nullo loco excluso, multo minus indigena cu∣juscunque conditionis, dignitatis, status, ac natalium fuerit, libertatem concedat publice suam Religionem exercendi: Eam nihilominus Domini Catholici sinistram si∣bi sumunt & arrogant interpretationem, acsi haec liberi Religionis exercitii conces∣sio non aliter accipienda sit, multo minus permissa, nisi sub ista clausula, Salvo jure Dominorum Terrestrium: Quod jus terre∣stre (quod jus tantum servitutis corpora∣lis respicit) ipsi ad jus & Dominium in Conscientias quorumcunque, soli Deo competens, omnimodo trahunt, & exten∣dunt, sibique actu ipso in toto Regno vio∣lenter vindicant. Sic illo utitur Strigoni∣ensis Archiepiscopus Georgius Szecheni∣us in universo suo territorio ac Dioecesi, tamquam Dominus Terrestris, & Episco∣pus Strigoniensis, adversus omnes absque ullo discrimine ordines, Nobiles, Ignobi∣les: Iisque non solum pleno Religionis exercitio interdicit, verum etiam vehe∣mentissime eos persequitur, Ministros Verbi Divini Evangelicos per suos ejici∣ens, expellens, spolians, in vincula conji∣ciens, & in iis Contumeliosissime detinens: Donec tandem vel Religioni priori valedi∣cant, vel plane se Ministerii Evangelici munere semet abdicaturos validissima ma∣nus propriae testatione ac syngrapha spon∣deant. Eandem vim Eminentissimus Do∣minus Cardinalis sibi sumit, & usurpat Collonitius, sine ullo discrimine persona∣rum, non modo in Javarinensi admini∣stratura atque Comitatu, sed & tutorio Orphanorum Rakotzhianorum nomine, in eorum in Superiore & Inferiore Hun∣garia Dominiis, adversus Ecclesiasticae & Civilis, Nobilis & Ignobilis conditionis atque ordinis Evangelicos: Praecipue au∣tem in Javarinensi, Soproniensi, Eisenbur∣gico, & aliis Comitatibus: Nec non in Lebnicensibus, Rachoczianis terris, in Trenchiniensi Comitatu; ut & in Supe∣riore Hungaria in Zempliniano, Heveza∣no, & Abauyarensi Comitatibus, in XII. oppidis privilegiatis, quae sunt Thuoa, Mar, Szantho, Keretzthur, Tarczal, Liska, Benxe, Tholizva, Patak, Ughel∣ly, Borsy, & Tokay; aliisque item in locis plurimis: Ubi omnium Reformato∣rum partim de integro condita, partim è ruderibus redintegrata Templa, Scholae, Domus pastorum Parochiales, cum suis appertinentibus (quorum omnium tem∣pore conditi Articuli Soproniensis reapse fuere possessores, quaeque ipsis juxta Ar∣ticuli contentum relicta sunt) vi ipsis erepta sunt, Ecclesiarumque Ministri munere suo depulsi, atque deturbati: Ut silentio vis ipsis eorum personis illata▪ atque etiamnum indesinenter exercitae injuriae, atque violentiae transmittan∣tur. Quin & hujus clausulae praetextu Om∣nes alii Episcopi, Praepositi, & Abbates suis in ditionibus, in primis autem in di∣tionibus Tóckelianis quondam, nunc Turcae ereptis, ubi plurimi habitant; ac commorantur Reformati, abutuntur: Imo vero & omnes Magistratus, ac nobiles quicunque, & Ecclesiastici suis in Ter∣ritoriis: Adeo ut & Civitates nonnullae, interque eas Catholicus urbis Epperies Magistratus, sub praetextu Dominii Ter∣restris, ex Urbe illa, quae per Articulum illum disertim libertatis fruebatur privi∣legio, Ecclesiastas Evangelicos expule∣rint, & in exilium egerint; caeteros usu liberi Religionis exercitii privarint, nul∣lo alio jure, quam quod illius clausulae abusus, & iniquissima interpretatio sug∣gessit, & suppeditavit: Quae revera om∣nis ad hoc usque tempus exercitae persecu∣tionis unica scaturigo est.
Oratio ad Caesarem Leopol∣dum Maximum, Wiennae in spe∣ciali audientia die 22 Junii, Ann. 1690. circa horam 8. Vesperti∣nam habita, pro statu Evangeli∣co Hungarico, & nominatim pro Comitatu Thurocziensi, per Ge∣nerosum D. Paulum Okoliczani dicta & instituta, adstantibus e∣gregiis Joanne Scredy, & Paulo Sallay, ejusdem status Evangelici Ablegatis. ADMISSI ad Augustum Majestatis vestrae Sacratissimae conspectum, quod ipsi afflictiones nostras proprii oris Ministerio in benignum sinum effundere possimus, primum hoc nomine nobis gau∣demus: postea, quod Majestatem vestram Sacratissimam salvam & incolumen nobis, infimis licet, attamen fidelibus subditis in∣tueri, contemplarique Deus concessit, no∣mine Principalium nostrorum Majestati vestrae Sacratissimae in laetitiam effusi gra∣tulamur. Oramus etiam ejus Divinam Majestatem ut, qua Omnipotenti Coelica ope hactenus universis Majestatis vestrae Sacratissimae adfuit Regiis negotiis, ea∣dem imposterum quoque victricibus ar∣mis, & fortibus militibus adesse velit, ut conculcatis universis ad ultimum hosti∣bus, tandem ad tranquillum amoenae Pa∣cis portum ex belli fluctibus cum fidelibus populis suis emergere possit. Tertius jam vertitur annus, Augustissi∣me Imperator, ex quo homines nostri uni∣versorum scilicet statuum Evangelicorum Hungaricorum, demissorum fideliumque Majestatis vestrae Sacratissimae subditorum, humillimi Ablegati, qui hic mecum ad∣stant, ad Augustam Majestatis vestrae Sa∣cratissimae Aulam continuis quasi excubiis haesitantes Sacrum Majestatis vestrae pe∣ctus de libertate oppressae Religionis E∣vangelicae assiduo pulsant, & sollicitant. Quibus sollicitationibus, & ipsi etiam Re∣ligionis oppressioni, Commissarii Maje∣statis vestrae in hoc negotio ad men∣tem Articulorum exmissi, ac ante bienni∣um procedentes, dederunt, praebuerunt∣que vel maximam ansam atque materiam: Quippe illi extra benignam Majestatis vestrae instructionem, & contra sensum Articulorum, ea, quae ibidem clarissima sunt, peregrina quapiam interpretatione ad libitum pro obscuris habuerunt, & quae ibidem non habentur, adjecerunt, nobisque Sacro Majestatis vestrae nomine portanda imposuerunt. Quemadmodum haec om∣nia tot Memorialibus nostris per istos di∣missos Ablegatos nostros à dicto triennio, vix non quotidie porrigi solitis, exacte claréque liquidavimus. Ad quae omnia, & imprimis ad id, quod die 27 Maii in Laxenburg benignis Maje∣statis vestrae Sacratissimae manibus sup∣plices porrexere, dum nosmet relegamus, Majestatem quoque vestram supplices pro∣vocamus, per Deum immortalem obte∣stantes, ut jam tandem benigne sese ad ea resolvere, & ex Commissionibus ortam du∣bietatem auctoritate sua Caesarco Regia tollere non dedignetur. Sed quia Majestas vestra Sacratissima toto hoc triennii tem∣pore, aliis etiam Regiis Curis obruta, necdum sese benigne resolvere potuit, Ad∣versarii nostri hinc arrepta occasione no∣vos contra nos assumunt animos, & in vulgus jactant; Majestati vestroe miseram sortem nostram, quam ipsi augent, cordi non esse: Nos à Regia gratia, benigna∣que Protectione prorsus abjectos esse: Adeoque ipsis quodlibet in nos licere. Contestari sumus saepenumero, Invictissi∣me Caesar, brevi fore, nisi cohibeantur, illorum insolentiam in apertam vim, effu∣sionemque innocentis Sanguinis nostri e∣rupturam; & jam hujus rei tragicae quod∣dam praeludium in Comitatu nostro Thu∣rocziensi persentiscere cogimur, quando certo Majestatis vestrae mandato nobis ne∣que citatis, neque auditis, ex inclyta Hungarica Cancellaria emanato, facti su∣mus quasi catharmata ad immolationem destinata. Unde ego, fidelis Majestatis vestrae Sacratissimae subditus, peculiariter missus ad Regium Majestatis vestrae Thro∣num, supplex compareo, spe plenus, me non tantum clementer auditum iri, sed si∣mul ad Principales meos vitam, salutem, & libertatem, pro innocentia nostra, à Majestate vestra reportaturum esse. At∣tulerunt videlicet Domini Plebani Catho∣lici certum mandatum contra nos, cujus vigore non jam juris processum, sed vio∣lentam rerum nostrarum direptionem, & personarum arrestationem minitantur: I∣mo jam ipso facto exequuntur. Petiimus equidem instantissime Paria istius Mandati, sed non aliud responsum tulimus, quam quod à Majestate vestra Sacratissima, vel à quopiam alio, in∣terdictum sit illis, ne Paria ejus nobiscum communicentur: Quo pacto non modo Sacro Majestatis vestrae nomini injuriam faciunt, sed & trahunt in suspicionem, quasi vero Majestas vestra Sacratissima ta∣lia
ibi subscripserit, quae in apricum deve∣nire indecens esset. Dum tamen legeretur, & publicaretur idem Mandatum, quantum ani∣madvertere potuimus, in hoec verba esse obser∣vavimus: Intellexisse nimirum Majestatem vestram quomodo Proedicantes nostri (quos il∣li ita per contemptum vocant) per Arces, per Castella, per Domos, & sic consequenter eva∣gentur: Quomodo in Parochias eorum invo∣lent: Quomodo sacra eorum turbent, & suo ritu Evangelico populis administrent: Quomo∣do (quod scelus nefasque est, nostra Religione indignum) Nobiles oeque ac ignobiles ad se∣ditionem disponant, & hinc nos Magnates, No∣biles, & Ignobiles concitatos neque Templa frequentare velle, neque festa celebrare velle, neque aliquid illis solvere velle, imo susque deque contra Articulos, contra ordinationem Commissionis facere omnia. Quorum enu∣meratorum veluti minima levissimaque pars certo respectu & consideratione le∣gum vera esse potest, ita potior eorum pars falsa & sinistra est. Verum id qui∣dem est, nos illis nihil solvere, sed id non facimus temere, verum beneficio sacri di∣plomatis & Articulorum Soproniensium, qui expresse dictant: Evangelicum Catho∣lico, & contra Catholicum Evangelico nihilo teneri. Quod celebrationem fe∣storum sinistrum est, quippe siquid pro∣pria laus valeret, auderem dicere Majori nos Communia festa celebrare observati∣one, quam illos, qui saepe (& si illos ac∣cusatum non veni) levissimo munusculo corrupti diebus festis crassos permittant labores. Non nego unum alterumve esse festum, quod Religio nostra non recepit; tamen & his diebus à crassioribus absti∣nendo laboribus consulto ita nos gerimus, ne illis nos criminandi ansa supersit. Por∣ro ubi de non frequentatione Templorum ajunt, verum dicunt, quia omnia ademe∣rant: Ne unum quidem ergo cum sit, quod frequentare permittant pro libertate nostrae Religionis, inter reliquos divinos ritus nostros pro incolumitate Majestatis vestrae Sacratissimae sub dio etiam orare solemus. Quod de seditione dicunt, quem∣admodum Maximum ac sinistrum est, ita injuriosissimum, ac nisi docuerint, quae accusant, talione poenae compensandum. Nuper in Generali Congregatione, ubi Clerus, nostri accusatores, frequenti nu∣mero aderant, publice protestati sumus, ut, quis sit ille seditiosus, denominent, nos esse futuros primos, qui capiemus, & quo Majestas vestra Sacratissima jusserit, aut ducemus, aut justo juris ordine serva∣to puniemus. Sed nonnihil tacentes po∣stea publice professi sunt, se de seditione apud Majestatem vestram neminem accu∣sasse. Ad extremum, non ut contra Arti∣culos Sopropnienses quidquam patraremus, quin potius propterea haec omnia pati∣mur, quod Ordinationibus Commissio∣num non acquiescentes à tenore & bene∣ficio legis nos abstrahi non permitta∣mus. Haec illa sunt, Augustissime Imperator, conficta crimina, quorum caussa neque citati, neque auditi, à Majestate vestra Sacratissima tamen capi jubemur. Quae cum non vera esse constanter asse∣vero; simul de genu flexo pro Principali∣bus meis Majestatis vestrae Sacratissimae humillimis fidelibusque subditis supplico, dignetur Majestas vestra Sacratissima Cle∣menti nos oculo respicere: Dignetur in periculo constitutis adesse: Dignetur il∣los, siquid contra nos praetensionis ha∣bent, ad juris viam, non potentiam, rele∣gare; illisque suapte natura in nos perse∣quendos proclivibus Mandati sui occasio∣nem tollere, idemque cassare. Eripiat nos Majestas vestra Sacratissima ab insultibus & libidine Inimicorum nostrorum, para∣tos, siquid peccavimus, Ordini juris nos ubicunque sistere. Faciat Majestas vestra Sacratissima ut persèntiscant, Majesta∣tem vestram Sacratissimam aeque no∣bis esse benignissimum Regem, atque illis: Quam benignitatem de omnium gentium jure exposcimus: Siquidem non minore fidelitate, non minore prom∣ptitudine, quam illi, universa Majesta∣tis vestrae Sacratissimae pro quavis ne∣cessitate serimus onera, & praestamus Re∣gia serviria. Ad haec Caesar reposuit: Percepi Orationem vestram nomine omnium Inclytorum statuum Evangelico∣rum, & comitatus nostri Thurocziensis, fidelium subditorum nostrorum, per Te factam: Quemadmodum ante hac saepe, ita nunc Nos resolvimus, quod sicuti u∣nice intendimus, ut penes Articulos ulti∣marum diaetarum conservaremini, ita num∣quam erat intentio nostra, ut vos ex Gratia & Protectione nostra excludamus. Confidite igitur. Quae autem hic verbo reposuistis, ea perlecto etiam hoc supplici libello nunc nobis porrecto considerabi∣mus, captoque consilio, quidquid juxta benignam Intentionem nostram, aequita∣temque justitiae conveniens fuerit, facie∣mus, habebitisque congruam resolutio∣nem.
De caetero Vobis, vestrisque Principalibus, Caesareo-Regia Gratia nostra propensi manemus. Haec elocuta sua Majestate Sacratissima vicissim Ablegatus ait: Serenissime Imperator, periculum nostrum, in quo jam Principales mei facto ipso conflictantur, moram non patitur; ac proinde per omnia Dei Sacra, & per om∣nia jura regalia obtestor, ut Majestas vestra Sacratissima benigne, & quidem cito succurrat. Imperator respondit: Jam, jam erit. 'His flexo poplite discessum. Sacratissima Caesarea Regiaque Majestas.

Exhib. die 28 Mens. Aug. 1690. Viennae in personali audientia. Monsieur, LE vingtiéme du mois passé arriva icy devant la ville une Tartane de Mar∣seille, avec des Lettres expressement depe∣chées de la part de la Cour de France pour l'Ambassadeur d'icelle, qui reside icy. Le dit Ambassadeur fit un peu aprés scavoir au Caimacam Pascià, que l'armée Royalle sons la conduite du Duc de Luxembourg avoir touta fait battu l'armé des Etats des Pro∣vinces Unies, avec la perte de tout leur bagage, artillerie, & amunition de guerre: Combien qu'elle fut un peu au paravant ren∣forcée de vingt mille Alemans: Et que la Flotte Froncoise, aprés avoir cherchée & trouvée l'es Flottes des Anglois & Hollan∣dois combinées dans le Canal, lés avoit at∣taquées & mises en fuitte, avec la perte de vingt vaisseaux de guerre, pris ou ruinez. Il y adjouta encor beaucoup des autres nou∣velles inventées, receues de Allemagne, Angleterre, Ecosse, Irlande, & Savoye: Les quelles furent debitées entre la popu∣lace avec une telle vray semblance, que la pluspart les creurent étre absolument veri∣tables. En suitte de cela demanda le dit Ambas∣sadeur la permission de fair publiquement des feux de joye: & la commodité de la posse pour un gentilhomme, qu'il disoit étre expressement envoyé du Roy son Maitre; pour communiquer ces nouvelles au Grand Vizir. On luy accorda l'un secrettement, & l'autre ouvertement: & parce que je n'avois receu le moindre ávis de tout celà, ny de l'état des autres affairs de la Chréti∣enté, je ne pouvois rien farre contre le de∣bite de ces nouvelles. Mais cette joye ne dura pas longtems; mais seulement jusques au 22. quand il arriva icy un expresse du Grand Vizir: & peu apres le Caimacam Padiscià me fit tenir deux de vos Lettres tres civiles du 4 & 6 du mois passé d'Aout, bien Seellées & conditionnées, avec les Let∣tres des Messieurs les Etats Generaux, & des autres. Par cellescy j'appris la con∣quête absolve d'Irlande, & la treraitte du Roy Jaques en France. Je ne doute pas, si le Roy Guillaume pourroit encor cette étée employer ses forces contre la France, que cette campagne se termineroit heurese∣ment pour les Alliez. Les Batailles ont été assez rudes & diffi∣ciles: Mais puisque le Prince de Waldecq a remise l'armée des Etats en meilleur état le 24 de Juillet, qu'elle ne fut devant la ba∣taille, & qu'il même en a donné avis aux Etats, qu'il vouloit le 27 chercher l'enne∣my, & luy livrer bataille de nouveau: &,
que les Flottes d' Angleterre & d' Hollande sont en état de se remettre bien tôt en mer, j'espere, que nous en aurons en peu de tems des bonnes nouvelles, comme aussi des armées des Alliez, principalement de cella de Savoye, que je croy & considere comme la principalle. Je suis en cela du même sentiment, que V▪ Excel. que la France succomberà tôt ou tard, qu'elle se remue, tant qu'elle veuil∣le; & principalement, quand toutes les Forces d'Angleterre se jetteront sur elle. J'ay fait une ouverture de tout celà, & de tout ce, qui me parût etre utile aux nos af∣faires, au Grand Vizier: & je l'ay exhor∣té dienvoyer plein pouvoir aux Ministres de la Porte, qui sont a Comarom, de traitter & conclurre la Paix, ou la trefue, avec les Imperiaux: En quel ces je l'assurois, que V. Exc. & l'Envoyéd' Angleterre diregeroi∣ent selon les ordres du Roy & des Etats l'af∣faire de telle sorte, que cette guerre si san∣glante seroit bien tôt houreusement termi∣née d'une on d'autre maniere, avec satisfa∣ction & au contentement des Parties. J'ad∣joutois encor à tout cela la feiblesse de la France, & le grand peril, que ce Roya-Court: & j'ay luy remontré de nouveau, & assuré, que le Roy, pour eviter sa totale ruine, sollicite continuellement sous main le Pape & la Republique de Venise, pour ob∣tenir la Paix par leur intercession: & par Consequence, qu'il soit tems, que les prin∣cipaux Ministres de la Porte ouvrent enfin les yeux, & que se ressouvenans de la per∣fidie des Francois tant de fois eprouvée contre tous les contracts faits avec la Porte, ils ayent enfin une horreur de cette nation perfide & trompeuse, qui ne cherche rien d'autre chose, que son prope interêt, & qui ne se soncie point des plaintes des leurs Alliez, formées sur le dementy de leur pa∣role, honneur, & sermens, quand elle peut Seulement parvenir au bout de leur desseins. J'ay aussi donné avis au grand Vizir de la restitution & du renforcement des Armées des Etats par terre, & par mer: & l'ay parfaitement informé del état des Armées des Alliez sur le Rhin, & la Meuse, dans le Pays Bas, la Savoye, Catalogue, & le Milanois, & principalement de la victoire remportée en Irlande. J'ay envoyé cette lettre par poste au Camp des tures: & j'en attens la reponce avant encor que je ferme celle cy, afin de la communiquer à V. Excel. Le Caimacam Pascia me demanda, aux quelles conditions je croiois qu'on pourroit faire unc Paix: Sur celâ je luy remontray le vray interêt de son Maitre, & dis, que j'attois d'opinion, qu'on feroit la tréve à cette condition, que chacun retiendroit, ce, qu'il possede. Ce Caimacam est assez por∣té pour la paix, mais il depend tout du Grand Vizir: C'est pourquoy qu'il faudrà attendre sa reponce sur ma derniere, pour scavoir sa resolution la dessus. Mais je ne m'imagine pas, que cette cour ferà quel∣que chose dans cette affair ay, devant que la Campagne sera finie; parce que les troup∣pes des Imperiaux dans ces quartiers là sont si peu considerables, & celles des Turcs fort nombreuses, d'autant plus, que le Grand Vizir ait desia mis le Siege avec son Armée de vant Nizze, & que le Tókely joint avec les Turcqs ait fait une invasion dans la Transylvanie avec une terrible Mas∣sacre des Trouppes Imperiales, & la prise de leur General Heisler, du Marquis Do∣ria, & du Comte Magni, avec beaucoup des autres Officiers: Joignez-y la prise de Widin. Tout celà causerà un tres grand changement dans les traittez de Paix, & dans les affaires. On a au commencement traitté cette Nation, comme tout a fait abatue, & vaincue: Jusques à ce, qu'on osoit preten∣dre d'elle le tribut: Ce qu'irrita les Turcs de telle sorte, qu'etans au desespoir ils se sont portez à une vigoureuse defence: & on aurà à faire de les remettre à la raison, si la Campagne se termine pour eux si heu∣reusement, comme elle êt commencée. Con∣noissant donc, combien il importe au Roy d' Angleterre & aux Etats, que cette guer∣re soit finie, je ne laisseray pas d'avertir V. Excell. de tems en tems de tout ce, que s'y passe. Le 25 du mois passé, quand toutes les preparations étoient faittes par l'Ambassa∣deur de Francoise pour les rejouissances publiques, le Caimacam, étant mieux in∣formé, fit defence aux Musiciens de s'en al∣ler au palais du dit Ambassadeur: & ainsi disparut toute cette joye Francoise; de sorte qu'on alluma seulement quelques cen∣taines des lampes, & qu'ondechargea tros∣fois quelques pierriers retirez des barques Francoises, mis dans la basiecourt du dit hôtel. Cette Ceremonie se finit à huit heures du soir: & le jour suivant l'Ambas∣sadeur fit ôter tout cet appareil à l'instance Serieuse du Caimacam: Mais il ne peut pas digerer cela, sans en montrer son mecon∣tentement, & chagrin. A Pera di Constan∣tinopoli, ce 14 de Sept. 1690.
AYANT achevé calle-cy jusques là, & destitué d'unc occasion favorable de l'envoyer à V. Excell. je receus le 29 par mon dragoman, qui revenoit du Campe∣ment Turcq une Lettre du Grand Chance∣lier de cett' Empire. Il in écrit, que le Premier Vizir avoit receu ma Lettre avec les Relations, qui y etolent jointes, du 25 d' Août, & qu'il l'avoit leue avec beaucoup de plaisir & satisfaction, sans s'expliquer d'avantage: Mais il y adjoute seulement, que le Grand Vizir me prie de luy faire ce plaisir de l'informer doresenavant de tems en tems de tout ce, qui se passera dans la Chrétienté. Cette reponce me fait juger (sauf un meilleur jugement) que le Grand Vizir attendrà jusques à la fin de cette Campagne, & qu'il prendrà ses mesures, selon lé succes de ses entreprises, & de celles des Armées des Alliez: & qu' après il formerà la dessus ses resolutions de faire la Paix, ou de continuer la guerre. Le 9 Sept. se rendit la ville de Nizza par accord au Grand Vizir: & le 16. l'Armée decampa & marcha vers Semendria. On m'a averty, que le Grand Vizir voyant le mi∣serable état des Trouppes Imperialles qui se trouvent sur les frontieres, étoit de re∣solution d'attaquer Belgrado. V. Excell. jugerà aisement, áyant connoissance par∣faitte de l'humeur & naturel des Turcqs, combiens les affaires se changeront par ces heureus succes. Je feray neanmoins tout mon possible de disposer le Grand Vizir à embrasser la Paix, aussitôt qu'il Sera de retour dans les Quartiers d'hyver. Mais j'ay besoin pour celà des nouvelles instructi∣ons. Quelque avantage remporté sur les Francois contribueroit beaucoup pour met∣tre cette Nation à raison. Si cela se peut faire, il serà tresutile, que V. Excell. m'a∣vertisse de mois en mois par la voye d'Hon∣grie de tout ce, qui se passe dans la Chréti∣enté, envoyant la duplique par Venise. Quand les Trouppes Turcques seront dans leurs Quartiers d'hyver, j'espere, que j'au∣ray la Commodité d'entretenir cette corre∣spondance avec V. Excell. par la voije de la Valachie. Je demeure, &c. De V. Excellence le Treshumble Serv. COLYER. A Pera di Const. ce 3 d'Octob. 1690. Voicy une Lettre, qui m'est envoyée du Camp Tureq: Dans la quelle V. Excel. trouverà beaucoup des particularitez. Sacratissima Caesarea Regiaque Majestas, Domine Domine Clementissime. Augustissime Imperator, CUM gravissimo satis Cordolio neces∣sitor Majestati vestrae Sacratissimae humillime detegere, quomodo & qualiter afflictissimum Hungariae Regnum in ulti∣ma sua gemat calamitate, ubi jam à vi∣ginti & amplius annis haec miserrima pa∣tria tot bellorum motibus adeo exhausta; & desolata, & conquassata est; ut, si sin∣gula notarentur, in eorundem enumerati∣one non horae, aut dies, verum anni cum magnorum voluminum conscriptione re∣quirerentur: Jam ex infinitis Regni hujus calamitatibus solummodo haec pauca sub∣necto: Quod, postquam Anno 1683. ante Septennium evoluto Christiani nominis hostis Turca totam Hungariam exceptis aliquot arcibus in fidelitate Majestatis ve∣strae Sacratissimae persistentibus sui juris fecisset, ac ipsam Majestatis vestrae Sacra∣tissimae residentiam, urbem inquam Vien∣nam, obsedisset, explicari non potest, quot millia animarum in Comitatibus Mo∣soniensi, Soproniensi, Jaurinensi, Vesz∣primiensi, Comaroniensi trucidaverit, aut in diram abduxerit captivitatem. Oppida & pagos centenos incineravit; Arces, ca∣stella, curias igne consumpsit; verbo; milliones damnorum fecit. Quibus pera∣ctis, cum Do adjuvante, victricibus Ma∣jestatis vestrae Sacratissimae ac aliorum Principum Christianorum armis idem ho∣stis à Vienna repulsus fuisset, quaenam damna amicus quoque exercitus Hungariae intulerit, nemo etiam disertissimus satis describere valebit. Nam plurimi pagi to∣taliter incinerati; incolae omnibus bonis spoliati ac trucidati sunt: & quod acerbi∣us fuit, illi iidem, qui propter fidelitatem à Turcis in nihilum quasi redacti fuere, ad solvendas tamen contributiones, & su∣stinenda hyberna quarteria adacti sunt: Quum tamen vicinae Austriae similiter rui∣natae ad aliquot annos exemptio data sit: Quo beneficio Hungariae partibus à Tur∣ca observatam fidelitatem totaliter incine∣ratis praeter unicum Mosoniensem Comi∣tatum frui non licuit, sed ad instar alio∣rum contribuere debuerunt, prout hoc in toto illo tractu supra Sopronium sito fa∣ctum est. His accessit fames horribilis, ubi comprobari potest, homines fame ene∣ctos à Sociis inaudito hactenus exemplo devoratos fuisse. Post haec secuta est im∣mensarum portionum solutio: Ubi solvi
etiam debebat pro iis, qui numquam in rerum natura fuerunt: Quae in tantum excrevit, ut postquam omnem suam sub∣stantiam miseri incolae proportionibus sol∣vissent, filios suos, & filias Turcis ven∣dere coacti sint, ut ab exsecutione milita∣ri se liberarent: Qui omnes ad Othoman∣nicam perfidiam transiere. Sed cum nec hoc sufficeret, tandem afflictissimi subditi charas conjuges suas & filias militibus ad illas violandas praebuerunt, & vendide∣runt, ut saltem aliquod liceret eisdem ha∣bere respirium. Hinc adulteria, stupra, virginum violationes, innumerabiles sunt consecutae. Sed nec his contenti fuere portionum Exactores, cum summa prae∣tensa omnes incolarum vires & facultates superaret. Itaque ad extrema remedia conversi deplorandi incolae foetum quoque in utero materno existentem taxarunt: Sed & animalia praegnantia taxata fuere ad solvendas contributiones: Quod in Comitatibus Pest, Pilis, & Solz contigis∣se ipsimet exactores fassi sunt. Super haec non pauci, dum hanc nimiam contributi∣onem solvere non possent, prae desperati∣one laqueo vitam finiverunt: Alii occisis prius prolibus ac uxore sibimet mortem intulerunt violentam: Qui casus in Co∣mitatu Trenchiniensi, ac in Superiore Hungaria contigit. Praeterea millenae ani∣mae, non valentes tam immensum jugum supportare, ad alias regiones transmigra∣runt, vacuam & desertam relinquentes pa∣triam: Ob quae super alios innocentes fa∣cta est executio militaris. Miles itidem nullam servat disciplinam militarem, sed omnia libere agit, totum Regnum depi∣lando, & devastando. Cum vero per ali∣quam regni partem transit, non aliter ac cum hostibus agit; & ubi currus, aut e∣quos pro vectura sufficientes habere non potest, nobiles & rusticos onerat, velut jumenta: Sicque eos horribiliter verbe∣rando ad onera portanda propellit: Quod factum est in Comitatibus Soproniensi & Castriferrei. Et passim in aliis innumera∣biles pagos combussit, nobiles personas vulneravit: Etiam non paucos occidit: Prout hoc cum duobus innocentibus Nobi∣libus Scholaribus Tyrnaviae accidit. De quibus Caesibus etsi saepius querela apud eos, ad quos pertinebat, exposita fuerit, nulla tamen data est desuper satisfactio: Quin potius tales querulantes novis affici∣ebantur injuriis: Adeo, ut justitiam pror∣sus exulasse nemo non videat. His acce∣dit, quod Commendantes locorum occu∣patorum longe lateque in circuitu & di∣strictu illo imperitant, & miseros subdi∣tos sibi contribuere cogunt. Item Admi∣nistratores Camerales ad vecturas, gratu∣itos labores, Contributiones, aliasque in∣finitas exactiones pendendas cum executi∣one militari super omnes portionum solu∣tiones afflictam plebem impellunt, talique pacto incolas ad ultimam adigunt despera∣tionem. Et sane haec inaudita contributio ad tantam excrevit summam, ut ab Ann. 1683. usque ad hunc 1690, triginta Mil∣lione▪ perat data solutio, praeter Trans∣sylvaniam & Conquista. Super haec au∣tem quanti constent militum excessus, so∣lus ille scire potest, ante cujus conspectum nihil occulti est: Partes quoque antea Tur∣cis dedititiae unto ore fatentur, se intra hos septem annos Majestati vestrae Sacratissi∣mae, plus debuisse solvere, quam centum annis immani Christiani nominis hosti Turcae. Quinimo à quo Hungaria stat in fide Christiana, tanta onera, quanta modo, numquam supportare coacta fuit. Et quod plane mirandum est, respectu vi∣cinarum Majestatis vestrae Sacratissimae Provinciarum nulla proportio servatur: Verum Hungaria, quae alias etiam sedes belli est, majoribus oneratur contributio∣nibus. Unde apparet ex praemissis, qua∣si intentio sit, ut Hungaria sit hominibus penitus vacua, ac ferarum habitaculum; quae tamen à tribus & amplius seculis pro defensione reliquae Christianitatis suum fudit Sanguinem; ac generose contra Turcas dimicando vicina regna Christia∣na protexit. Hinc quid amplius faciant miseri incolae, qui jam ultimum sangui∣nem suum cum tota substantia dederunt? Non habent, quod contribuant. Itaque efflagitant respirium aliquod, ut saltem vivere illis cum uxoribus ac prolibus lice∣at, & possint post tam insupportabile ju∣gum ad aliquam pervenire requiem; cum alias etiam vix ulla detur in orbe natio▪ quae talia cogitur supportare onera. Nihilominus etsi totaliter ruinati sunt miseri patriotae, videntes tamen hostium Majestatis vestrae Sacratissimae accessionem, ecce parati erunt arma capere, & cum ex∣ercitu Majestatis vestrae Sacratissimae se conjungere, ac in hostem proficisci. Unde spero, quod sex millia hominum, equitum videlicet & peditum ex parte regnicola∣rum prodibunt, si Majestas vestra Sacra∣tissima futuram hanc hybernarum portio∣num solutionem ipsis clementissime relax∣are, & in hanc militis conductionem, & intertentionem commutare dignabitur: Quibus si adjungantur milites confiniarii, facile decem millia virorum efficere pote∣runt: Qui omnes utile sane servitium praestabunt, & ad modum ac normam Regiminum ordinari, & hac hyeme exer∣ceri deberent: Essentque decem formalia Regimina, quinque equitum, & quinque peditum, qui in Hungaria ad liberam Ma∣jestatis
vestrae Sacratissimae dispositionem applicari possent. Neque vero iisdem dif∣fidendum est: Ipsi enim hactenus quoque in debita fidelitate perstiterunt tam diu, quam diu immanis Turca non totam occu∣pavit Hungariam: Ubi resistere nemo potuit; cum & arma quoque Majestatis Vestrae Caesareae recesserint. Augustis∣sime Imperator, existimo hoc servitium spontaneum afflictissimorum regnicolarum pro servitio Majestatis vestrae Sacratissi∣mae utilius fore, quam portionum solutio∣nem; quae utinam non ad ultimam de∣sperationem adigat patriotas miseros: Un∣de si Majestati vestrae Sacratissimae benigne placuerit haec modalitas, oportet, ut in∣tra breve tempus cognoscam clementissi∣mum Majestatis vestrae Sacratissimae as∣sensum; & tum dispositionem quoque fa∣cere possim super contribuendis militibus: De cujus modalitate Majestatem vestram Sacratissimam etiam, hic Viennae humilli∣me informare non intermittam. Et sane, Augustissime Imperator, cum necessario miles Germanicus in Hungariam migrare pro hac hyeme debeat, miles Hungaricus hac conditione offertur, ut praelibatus miles Germanicus proprio vivat sumptu, tam in transitu, quam in quartirio: & non onerentur loca non cincta actuali quartirio, cum sint alias etiam sufficientis∣sima & capacissima loca, in quibus magna Armata potest optime collocari: Quae eti∣am, si Majestas vestra Sacratissima cle∣mentissime mandaverit, paratus sum in aliqua conferentia proximis diebus insti∣tuenda demonstrare; humillime iterum atque iterum supplicando, Majestas vestra Sacratissima dignetur ex innata Caesarea Regiaque Clementia sua Nationem Hun∣garicam, eidemque annexos incolas pa∣terno affectu suo prosequi, & humillimos suos subditos sublevando benignissime consolari. Pro qua Majestatis vestrae Sa∣cratissimae, gratia Deus Opit. Max. lon∣gaevum ac felicissimum concedat Ma∣jestati vestrae Sacratissimae ejusdemque Augustae domui, Regimen: Haec erant, quae Majestati vestrae Sacratissimae velut Regni Palatinus summa cum demissione repraesentare volui.

LITERAE Illustriss. Dominationis ve∣strae tam Sacrae Regiae Majestati Do∣mino meo Clementissimo, quam mihi,
redditae sunt per Cursorem circiter vel ultra octiduum. Post quas siquidem pro∣missum Dominationis vestrae Illustriss. ad∣ventum subsecuturum indies sperabam, commendatum ab ipso negotium differe∣batur ad praesentiam ejusdem. Dum vero rursus de 6 Febr. gratissimas Illustriss. Dominationis vestrae accipio, com∣municavi easdem quam primum Sacrae Re∣giae Majestati Domino meo Clementissimo. Cujus mentem & studia erga Augustissi∣mum, prout semper, ita etiam & nunc ar∣dentissimis affectibus exuberare cognovi, licet non absque summo angore animi huc∣usque hic detineatur, ob nullam resolutio∣nem Neoburgo ad hoc ipsum momentum, nec sciat, quomodo ulterius rebus suis & dispositionibus insistere debeat. Si enim quamcunque Neoburgo categoricam ac∣cepisset notitiam, jam non modo in itine∣re, sed Varsaviae pridem fuisset. Accedit ad ejusdem Sacrae Regiae Majestatis gra∣vissimam molestiam, quod ne Vienna qui∣dem hucusque ullam firmitudinem habeat de quantitate jungendarum quomodo & qualiter copiarum, Augustissimi cum suis pro futura belli expeditione, qua jam vix unico à nobis mense distare videtur. Sed nec in Moscoviam pridem destinari promissus hucusque comparet Ablegatus, de cujus adventu Sacra Regia Majestas jam dudum certa proprium etiam Aulicum ablegare jam designaverat. Interim in Moscovia continuus aliquis percrebescit rumor suspiciones vel timores hostium ci∣ens. Vel si hoc deesset periculum, donec perveniat desideratus Ablegatus, donec a∣liquid suasum effecerit, Vernum tempus transibit, adeoque illa auxilia vel nulla, vel post bellum. Legati etiam à Palatino Moldaviae illuc pervenisse certo dicuntur cum conditioni∣bus Pacis à Porta proponendis. Quae om∣nia dum Sacra Regia Majestas Dominus meus Clementissim. Illustriss. Dominationi vestrae exposita esse voluit, desiderare vi∣detur, ut tamquam optimus Minister publicae Communis, ac Reipubl. Christia∣nae felicitatis percupidus, Augustissimo Imperatori ita repraesentare velit, quomo∣do expeditior rerum omnium, ac negotii futurae bellicae expeditionis fieri valeat de∣terminatio. Quantum spectat propositum negotium respectu Conditionum Pacis cum Porta per Angliae & Hollandiae Ablegatos com∣municandarum, jam id Sacram Regiam Majestatem Dominum meum Clementissi∣mum ante quatuor forte septimanas prae∣stitisse, punctaque earum Conditionum in Manus Domini Ablegati, Residentis sui, transmisisse, necessum est constare Il∣lustriss. Dominationi vestrae, aegre licet in id ipsum consentiente Senatu Leopoli pro tribunali Thesauri Regni assidente, ob eam vel maxime rationem, quod per Mi∣nistros externos, nec ullum commercium in dicto negotio nobiscum habentes, res devolvatur. Effecit tamen Sacra Regia Majestas Do∣minus meus Clementissimus quo sine mo∣ra praedictae Conditiones, quarum hic an∣necto copiam, Viennam mitterentur, ut re ipsa exhiberet, quantum etiam in ar∣duis voluntati Augustissimi obsecundare contendat: Cui quod me commendan∣dum promittat, intra fortunam vitae re∣putabo, si saltem nomine tenus innotuisse Augustissimae Majestati Domino Clemen∣tissimo licuerit: Qui etiam mortibus duo∣rum fratrum meorum patruelium ad Bel∣gradum redimere annixus sum memoriam mei. Quod reliquum est, obsequia mea Illustrissimae Dominationi vestrae pluri∣mum commendo, mansurus semper, &c. Zolkiewiae, d. xiii. Febr. Anno 1691.

Sacratissima Caesarea Regiaque Majestas, Domine Domine nobis naturaliter Clementis∣sime. DEMISSE repraesentare cogimur Majestati vestrae Sacratissimae quod quamvis Majestas vestra Sacratissima tem∣pore gloriosae Inaugurationis & Corona∣tionis Neo-Regis nostri Josephi, in Co∣mitiis Posoniensibus, inclytis Statibus & Ordinibus Regni Hungariae hoc ipsum proponi curaverit: Quod videlicet bona Neo-acquisita, ac victricibus armis è fau∣cibus gentis Othomannicae gloriose ere∣pta, eripiendaque, denuo Regno huic Hungariae benigne incorporare, iisdemque legibus, & non novis gubernare, in suis immunitatibus & libertatibus conservare vellet, ac niteretur: Ac insuper Articulos quoque Sopronienses super Religionis ex∣ercitio conditos 25 & 26 in iisdem Co∣mitiis gratiose confirmasset: In quibus Templa omnia, in quorum tempore con∣ditionis eorundem Articulorum actuali possessione status Evangelicus extitit, una cum Parochiis & Scholis, ac earundem proventibus, prae manibus eorundem re∣linqui ac permanere gratiose resolvisset, & quod imposterum nullae Templorum, Scho∣larum, & Parochiarum Occupationes, vel exercitii turbationes fiant, in hoc Regno Hungariae, sub poena ibidem expressa, se∣vere inhibuisset: Nihilominus tamen post∣positis istis & postergatis omnibus, Re∣verendissimi Domini Matthias Radonai, Episcopus quinque Ecclesiensis, & Fran∣ciscus Jani, Abbas Peczvaradiensis, qui in partibus nostris in superiori & Inferio∣ri videlicet Barovia, circa quinque Ecclesi∣as, è faucibus immanissimi hostis Otto∣mannici victricibus armis vestrae Majestatis gloriose ereptis, non ut liberum Religio∣nis exercitium imperturbatum relinque∣rent, quin imo diversis modalitatibus & viis, quoslibet excessus in praejudicium praefatorum Articulorum ac verbi Regii li∣center & pro placito attentarent. Cum e∣nim, Augustissima Imperatoriaque Maje∣stas, iidem praefati Domini Clerici, non, ut mens & intentio vestrae Majestatis es∣set, Regnum in statum priorem è desola∣to reducere intenderent; quin imo in eo quoque, quo nunc esset, omni studio ever∣tere & desolare, miserrimos partium no∣strarum incolas bonis & avitis possessioni∣bus privare, & si eorundem intentionem assequi nollent, omnes post Turcas rele∣gare non vererentur: Imo ex eo, quod confiteri noluissent, variis excogitatis sub praetextibus incaptivarunt, nonnullis in formam crucis defixis & alligatis hostia ori vi intrusa fuit, plenaeque possessiones integrae expilantur, ut haec manifesta vio∣lentiae exempla in Civibus Varkoniensi∣bus, Joanne nimirum & Andrea Czoma, plusquam mille talleras imperiales valenti possessione ob caussam Religionis despoli∣atis, satis superque edocent. Ac insuper ut haec talia conamina praedictorum D. D. Clericorum perseque felicius possent, Com∣missarium vestrae Majestatis Sacratissimae ad partes Neo-recuperatas exmissum, Il∣lustrissimum videlicet Tullium Miglionem▪ extra sphaeram suae instructionis, nescitur quibus exquisitis mediis, pro fautore sibi adsciscendo, qui denique certos Praedican∣tes, ut Nadasdiensem & Manjokiensem, aliosque cives & incolas partium nostra∣rum, variis ac variis sigillo suo munitis Commissionibus citatos, eosdemque de libero itu & reditu assecuratos, iisdem D. D. Praelatis inauditis processibus vexan∣dos tradidit, pro uti haec omnia ex unis literarum citatoriarum paribus ejusdem
D. Tullii Miglionis sub dato 14 Februar. emanatis, literaque A notatis, ac literis praetitulati D. Abbatis, dieque sequenti praefati mensis editis, literaque B signatis, & aliis Comminatoriis praedicti D. Com∣missarii, ex idiomate Hungarico in La∣tinum genuine translatis 21 Febr. extractis, literaque C signatis, nec non praefati D. Episcopi quinque Eccles. similiter in Lati∣num transsumptis, quasi sui facti testimo∣nialibus 2 Martii exaratis, literaque D notatis, & huic supplici libello annexis, clarissime apparerent. Unde, proh dolor! ista immanitas exiliit. Ubi ponit funda∣mentum haec nobis inflicta crudelitas? Haec enim omnia Sanctae determinationi vestrae Majestatis repugnarent, contraque benignam mentem & intentionem vestrae Majestatis practicarentur: Quia pro lu∣bitu in nos grassari, liberum nostrum Ex∣ercitium interturbare, armorum strepitu, terriculamentis, aliisque exquisitis sub co∣loribus opprimere nihil pensi ducerent, uti hoc iidem praefati D. Praelati, ac praetitu∣latus D. Commissarius, cum associato Illu∣strissimo D. Gabriele Veicsi, Commendante Szigetvariensi, qui adscitis hinc inde mi∣litibus miseros Veresmarthienses, ex eo solum fundamento, quod antecedenter in∣tentionem suam in eorum excidium inten∣dentem exsequi non permiserint, manu fere hostili crudeliterve adoriendo, omni∣bus eorundem bonis primum expilatis, tandem iisdem incolis quibusdam disper∣sis, aliis vero, quos ad manus habere po∣terant, captis, inque diram captivitatem secum abducendo; Miserandum & hor∣rendum nobis omnibus dederunt exem∣plum. Cujus rei testis est praetitulatus D. Episcopus quinque Eccles. in aliis lite∣ris Minatoriis in Latinum similiter trans∣sumptis, dieque 17 Martii datatis, lite∣raque E signatis. Nam cum sub jugo tur∣cico gemebundi tot annorum decursu jace∣bamus, pacifico usu & libertate nostra spi∣rituali utebamur: Aequum esset eo magis, ut sub auspiciis alarum vestrae Majestatis Sacratissimae tutam & imperturbatam ab omnibus vestrae Majestatis subjectis ha∣beamus. Quocirca ad pedes Augustissi∣mos vestrae Majestatis humillime provo∣luti per vulnera Christi oramus supplices, quatenus nobis taliter oppressis, & fere in extremitatibus constitutis, Majestas vestra Augustissima (in qua alioquin post Deum omnem spem & fiduciam liberati∣onis ponimus) paterne succurrere digne∣tur. Cum enim nostra libertas consistit vel maxime in libero Religionis exercitio, quod etiam piae reminiscentiae Regum, antequam fortuna novercante nostras pro∣vincias Turca hostis Christiani nominis immanissimus suae ditioni adjecisset, ad hoc usque tempus permansit libero usu inta∣ctum, juxta suum verbum regium san∣ctum, & irrevocabile, Articulis quoque confirmatum, ne sinat nos taliter oppri∣mi: Verum in sinum gratiae suae receptos, contra quosvis illegitime & indigne impe∣titores defendere, ac insuper literas pro∣tectionales benigne elargiri non dedigne∣tur, ut nos virtute earundem liberum Re∣ligionis nostrae exercitium reassumere, re∣assumptum in tota Superiori & Inferiori Barovia continuare possimus ac valeamus. Ac tum praefatis Dominis Praelatis, quam etiam praedicto D. Commissario Caesareo (ita & Commendanti Szigethiensi) decre∣to mediante clementer demandare, ut ab istis persecutionibus verbo Regio contra∣venientibus supersederent. Ut tandem nos clementem paternamque Invictissimae Imperatoriae vestrae Majestatis gratiam experti eo alacriori animo obsequia Ma∣jestati vestrae praestanda exsequi possimus. Quam Gratiam & Clementiam Majestatis vestrae Sacratissimae non solum ardentibus ad Deum fundendis precibus, verum eti∣am perpetua fidelitatis nostrae subjectione omni studio remereri contendemus gra∣tiosam quantocitius praestolaturi resolutio∣nem, Sacr. Caes. Regiaeque Majestatis vestrae Humillimi, perpetuoque fideles Subditi Superioris & Inferioris Ba∣roviae, Confiniorum, Op∣pidorum, & Pagorum Ci∣ves Evangelicae Religioni addicti. Exhib. die 16 April. 1690. RATIONES, PROPTER quas à Sacrâ vestrâ Cae∣sarea Majestate per commissum mi∣hi supremum exercitus regimen immeri∣tas Imperiales gratias, mihi ad agnoscen∣dum traditas, magno animi mei moerore, submississime deprecari coactus fuerim. Obligationi sic tamen meae incumbat Sa∣cra Caesarea Majestas vestra (quam sem∣per submississimo poplite venerari stu∣dui, & studebo) quam brevissime calcu∣lum in Hungaria, Transylvania, Sclavo∣nia, Servia, & Bulgaria, subsistentis mi∣litis, omniumque necessariorum medio∣rum tam ad oppugnanda, quam defen∣denda
confinia, secundúm exiguam artis ac Martis mei capacitatem, sine ullius rei notae necessariae omissione, ut & genuinas rationes, cur miles suae Sacrae Caesareae Majestatis ita sit divisus, omnesque illo∣rum, qui in acie cediderunt, circumstanti∣as, & defectum commeatuum, ac quali∣ter contra tam ingens inimici agmen, ob nobis imminens periculum, distantes Pro∣vinciae ac Regiones sub suae Sacrae Maje∣statis Caesareae protectione ultra proferri valeant, exponere, ac declarare. I. Igitur, nisi tractatus pacis aliquo temporis intervallo sepulti resumantur, & Pax, quae mihi tamen ignota, à suâ Sa∣crâ Caesareâ Majestate intra breve tem∣pus concludatur, non concipio, qualiter Nissa & Widdinum, omnesque trans Sa∣vum siti passus, sine speciali detrimento possunt defendi. Widdinum enim locus distans, ac nullum nisi Nissa, & hinc ad∣huc difficillimum succursum sperare po∣test, cum spatio unius diei penes Tinock, & illa ardua Starra Planina arctus & plane impenetrabilis passus reperiatur, in quo inimicus exiguo tantum milite nobis resi∣stere potest, ita ut nominatum Widdin, quod tum à nostro milite offensive agen∣do recuperatum ac munitum est, si ho∣die dum intenderet offensive hostem ag∣gredi, jam non solum illi omnis offensiva actio foret prohibita, verum certam jactu∣ram illius munitionis cum omnibus prae∣sidiariis intra breve temporis spatium ex∣periremur, & hac quidem de caussa: Nam etsi foret aliqua spes, aut resolutio lu∣crandi temporis, sciendum tamen est, nul∣lum effectum inde emanaturum, cum tunc Tartaris liberum foret Valachiam irrum∣pere, & inde cum exercitu suo Danubium navibus sine ullo impedimento transnavi∣gare Ratio enim est, cum permagnum inde apud Widdin sitam insulam Danubi∣us ita dividatur, ut etiam cum maximis navibus sursum & deorsum navigandi nul∣lum obstet impedimentum, nec à praesi∣diariis videri possit tunc oppugnari, ex his quoque plus metuenda jactura hujus mu∣nitionis, quamvis effective ab hoste ag∣gredi, & oppugnari non possit; tamen à concursu vulgi ita includi, ut certo hunc fortificatum passum obtineat. II. Nissam quoque secundum debilem capacitatem ingenii mei aliter efendi, quam per ingentem exercitum posse, non invenio, cum secundum omnium opinio∣nem nullo alio modo defendi posse judi∣catum sit, nisi prius omnes passus ex Ma∣cedonia & Bulgaria à nostro milite assecu∣rentur, & à copioso, benêque exercito milite occludantur, omnisque inimico in Bosniam & Serviam introitus impedia∣tur. In toto enim Nissensi districtu max∣imus defectus est graminis, quia ille in nimia siccitate terrae fundatus est: Ita ut si hostis Procopiam appropinquaret, ibi in omni securitate vivere posset, nec ul∣lum ex suis Provinciis, propter advehen∣tes diversa ac necessaria vitae victualia de∣fectum sperandum haberet. Noster vero miles non solum ob similem defectum cir∣ca Nissam subsistere non posset, verum etiam eidem timendum esset, omnia ne∣cessaria tam per aquam, quam per terram adnavigantibus & advehentibus posse im∣pediri, cum tali casu ab hostili conflictu non solum navigatio Bulgariae, Moravae, & impenetrabilis via circa Jagodinum & Nis∣sam omnimode invaderetur, verumetiam iis liberum esset, sive magnis, sive parvis turmis, trans viam, quae Crussa, vel Cra∣colovetz ducit, sine omni impedimenti cura usque Belgradensem portam accurre∣re. Multo minus etiam Bosniensibus, qui ad viginti millia exerciti milites sunt, in nullo absoluto loco resisti possibile est, ne penes Servianum Moravam, & illud tan∣tum, tantoque labore recuperatum fortis∣simum Belgradum, usque ad Danubium perveniant: & tandem ultimo, uti nec dubitari potest, hostilis exercitus, sive parvus, sive magnus, se citra Danubium Fetislau appropinquaret, uti per experien∣tiam anno praeterito captam constat, quod etiam vilissimis & exiguis turmis vel apud Possavaretz, vel in vicinia Ressava, per Gulicheinae viam quidem laboriosam, cur∣ribusque periculo expositam, sine omni e∣tiam minimo impedimento Servianum Moravam invadere, & hunc fluvium de∣nuo totaliter inutilem & impracticabilem reddere possent (cui malo tamen praeca∣vendum) nosterque exercitus ob suas to∣taliter debilitatas vires tantum tolerare non posset, ob tot'ac tam difficiles, labo∣riosasque vias, quas spero sat clare me de∣monstrasse, quod tam debilis ac parvus exercitus Nissae subsistens tam forti ac tam magnae hostili armadae non valeat resi∣stere. III. Jagodinae versabatur exiguus Cae∣sareus miles, ibi stans, ex supradictis ra∣tionibus in simili periculo, maxime cum augendo numerum militum Nissae à tam paucis adhuc aliquid plus detrahere neces∣sitas cogeret. Vereor itaque, necogatur residuum, quod superest, usque ad inter tormenta, vel ob defectum victualium trans Savum abducere. IV. Quod si tamen sua Sacra Caesarea Majestas omnibus his sepositis Clemen∣tissime annueret Nissam ad ultimam, eti∣am
extremam necessitatem oppugnanti ho∣sti resistere, submississime peto veniam, vestrae Sacrae Caesareae Majestatis infor∣mando, huic loco, etiamsi aliquis confli∣ctus, aut exercitus adesset, non posse succurri, cum per quandam, nempe viam Regiam, quae unica hora Nissa, penes Montana & Bulgaricum Moravam semial∣terius horae arctissimus passus formatus sit, ut nullatenus dubitari possit, quin ho∣stis talem non occupet, & ibi succursum nostris impediat. Locus enim iste, si per hunc tempus lucrari quaeramus, minimum septem, vel octo millibus, cum omnibus circumstantiis, ac omnibus necessariis, praemuniatur necesse est, & omnis defectus fortificationis, si quis aderit, pugnando compleatur. Ita tamen hoc stante, illa militia tanquam ad victimam ducenda sit, & quid inde emolumenti eruendum, om∣nium expertorum, imo sapientissimo ve∣strae Sacrae Caesareae Majestatis judicio committo, quidque per tot ponderosas in∣formationes agendum videbitur. V. Quod si tamen supra relevantia mo∣tiva in tam periculoso statu pro securiori∣bus consiliis locum obtinuerint, ex supra∣dictis causis (quod tamen vix possibile amplius erit, jamjam appropinquato ini∣mico) Nissa & Widdinum cum toto situ à Servia penes Danubium & Savum retineri non possint, cum tamen ad divertendum à Savo hostem, & defendendum Belgrad exiguus hic miles vix sufficiat. Nam licet Belgradum aliquo tempore aucto populo se possit defendere, tamen propter defe∣ctum succursus, qui ex parte terrae com∣parere nequiret, in Danubio per eundem suis navibus repelleretur, ab eodem faci∣le recuperari valet: & hinc non immeri∣to timendum, quod per similem defensi∣onem noster exercitus minuatur, hostique nullo modo valeat resistere: Imo etiam, ut nullo modo dubitandum, finita aliqua rigorosa defensione forte totam Sclavoni∣am deserere, consequenter, cum nullus passus praeterea reperibilis sit, usque ad Dravum, vel adhuc ulterius recedere co∣gamur. VI. Quod si tamen Belgradum non actu∣aliter oppugnaretur, infallibiliter tamen Albanenses & Bosnenses uno forti Turci∣co agmine confortabuntur in illo districtu, qui partim penes Savi passus subsistentem solidum exercitum occupare valenti talis ut impediatur, pariter magnus exercitus ex nostra parte desiderabitur tali resi∣stendi. VII. His & similibus aliis nisi Deus immediate concurrerit, naturaliter aliter credendum non est, quam quod inimicus aliquo conflictu sui totius exercitus, con∣junctis Tartaris, Valachis, & Moldensi∣bus, simul per aquam & terram Transyl∣vaniam invadet, illamque Provinciam lu∣crari tentaturus penes Danubium jacen∣tem: Cui qualiter resistendum sit, non video, ubi miles sufficiens, sufficienterque instructus, in his partibus inveniendus sit: Maxime cum illi male contenti po∣puli maximis gaudiis exultent, sise secun∣datos, aut aliunde sibi alios cognationales faventes reperiant. Illudque nobis etiam non parvum obstaculum est, quod certanti militi penes Danubium alteri parti nullum auxilium communicationis ergo, tali tem∣pore summe necessariae, talique periculo difficillimae, adferendum erit. Tum nec domus annonae, nec alia necessaria in lo∣co sint: Ita ut ipsa natura dictet, haec con∣finia, nempe Transylvaniam, & Hunga∣riam Superiorem, omniaque ab his de∣pendentia, in summo periculo versatura, nisi Deus nos sua speciali gratia erexe∣rit. VIII. Hungarica enim militia hujus u∣sus & naturae est, ut quamvis in aciem ordinata sit, non compareat, maxime, si longe à suis domibus in alienam Provin∣ciam commendetur, partim quod jam lon∣go tempore nullam solutionem acceperit, partim cum homines nauci & indiscipli∣nati aestimandi sint. Nec consultum est, istam copiosam ac barbaram gentem no∣stro parvo ac debili exercitui aggregare. Si enim, quod Numen evertat, unicus infelix conflictus nobis acciderit, nullum dubium, illam barbaram gentem contra nos arma in ipso aggressu apprehensu∣ram. IX. Praesidia locorum, quae numero quam brevissimo sunt exposita, diminui vix poterunt. Acque eodem modo ti∣mendum, ne apud tam paucum ac debi∣lem exercitum pro conservanda Provincia summe necessarium infelix casus contin∣gat. Si enim populus ab ipsismet incolis facile superari potest, ob plurimas ac gra∣vissimas distractiones tali non foret suc∣currendo: Sed summum detrimentum sentiremus: & ita tam totam Hungariam, quam Transylvaniam, in summam, & quidem prima pejorem rebellionem & tu∣multus, quos quotidie ejulat & suspirat, excidere perciperemus. X. Si tamen secundum adjacentes extra∣ctus summe necessarii exercitus formandi sint, qualiter sine maximo periculo jam supra adducta absurda devenire nihil con∣trarietur, & è contra effective status mihi
ab Consilio bellico transmissae listae exa∣men observatum fuerit, deductis dedu∣cendis numerus remanet, ut pluris alicui conflictui, quam pleno exercitui adnu∣merandus sit, ac impossibile tam late pa∣entem lineam tam potentis hostis vincere, aut impedire, ne illi in uno alióve loco pa∣riter in hac parte Danubii, quam altera, infringat, aut unam, alteramve provinci∣am devastet. XI. Et quamvis dicatur, quod succes∣sive decessus regiminum per noviter ele∣ctum militem suppleatur, & compleatur, considerandum tamen est, quod non so∣lum complendus numerus illorum inter quaedam regimina vix inceperit, partim quod nec sibi debitam solutionem accepe∣rint; ita tamen, quod si feliciter Belgra∣dum adduci deberent, sex aut septem Mensibus, ut migrent ex Provinciis haere∣ditariis necesse habent, & ita demum ad finem campi bellici; & cum difficultate adhuc vix prosunt: & ita sine omni utili∣tate de his loquendum. Nec loci situs his poterit demonstrari; tacendum, ut tan∣dem defessus miles tot tantisque curis & vigiliis, portansque contra inimicum, eti∣amsi non in tantas, certe in plures nauseas devenire posset. XII. Victualibus pro necessitate Nissae aliquot mensibus provisum esse constat: Quae autem utilitati exercitus parum pro∣sunt, aut in absentia illius plane nihil uti∣litatis adferre possunt, sinon plane inimici cederent. Belligradi, in quantum notum est, huc usque nullam stabilitam domum annonae; & quamvis actualiter hic Vien∣nae de iis mature transmittendis contra∣ctum sit, tamen ejus certitudo multis im∣pedimentis subjacet.

Lettre de Monsieur Colyer, Ambassadeur d'Hollande à Constantinople. Monsieur, J'EUS, le 20 Decembr. de l'année passée, l'honneur devous avertir par le Seigneur Baron Gall de tout ce qui se passoit icy▪ & en voicy la duplique. Depuis ce tems là, le 23 du même mois, fit le Premier Vizir son entrée publique dans Constantinople: Au quel je fis en personne le compliment de congratulation, le 19 Janvier; & fus receu & traitté de luy avec beaucoup de courtoi∣sie & civilité, sans que ni l'un ni l'autre dit un mot, ou nomma l'Empereur & les Princes Allemans, ou le Roy de France. Cela se fit de ma part à dessein▪ & avions
nous, moy & l'Ambassadeur d'Angleterre, concerté & conclu celà, afin de donner quel∣que soupcon au Gr. Vizir, qui avec beau∣coup de faste & d'orgueil se retiroit, & re∣venoit de la guerre, des desseins & prepara∣tions à la Guerre de l'Empereur, pour la Campagne suivante: Principalement étans tres assurez, que, combien que nous eussi∣ons euës les ordres absoluës de traiter avec luy de la Paix, il ne nous écouteroit pas, ou qu'il nous feroit des Propositions si exor∣bitantes, que cette negotiation se rompe∣roit incontinent de soy-même. Nous ju∣geâmes donc, que nous ferions mieux de n'en parler un seal mot: & que nous cau∣serions en luy par nôtre silence quelque soupcon des forces Imperiales. Ce qui nous reüssit jusques là, que le dit Vizir laissa tomber apres ces paroles: Il faut, que l'Empereur & les Princes Allemans n'ay∣ent plus de crainte pour la France: Autre∣ment les Ambassadeurs d'Angleterre & d' Hollande n'eussent pas manqué de presser la Negotiation de la Paix. Adjoustez-y, que le Teckely se soucie fort peu des or∣dres de la Porte, ruinant la Walachie de fons en comble. Un vaisseau de guerre Anglois du Con∣voy de Smyrne a pris une Tartane Fran∣coise dans l'Archipel: & on à trouvé là de∣dans deux Lettres du Roy à son Ambassa∣deur icy: Des quelles ayant obtenu la Co∣pie, je me crûs obligé de vous en faire part, avec cette esperance, qu'on ne man∣querà pas à Vienne de trouver des maî∣tres en cette art, pour les deciffrer: & qu'on en tirerà des lumieres, & particularitez de grande consequence. Un Ingenieur, qui se nomme Signior Stefano, m'a confié, qu'il est le Comte Ni∣cola Guasco, natif de St. Amant, trois lieux de Valencienne, mais d'Origine Milanois: & qu'il a des Ordres de preparer en toute diligence 6000 Bombes pour la Campagne suivante. Il se repent de son erreur, & il m'a promis, qu'il ferà quelque chose d'im∣portance, que je n'ose pas vous Communi∣quer par cettecy, faute des ciffres. Il en∣voye par cette occasion un sien valet tres affidé, nommé Pietro Mollier, à Vienne, qui vous ferà le recit de beaucoup des par∣ticularitez. On attend icy de jour en jour le nouveau Ambassadeur d'Angleterre, qu' on dit étre dêja avancé jusques à Esseck. J'espere, que je recevray par son arrivement icy quelques ordres, pour remettre icy sur le tapis la Negotiation de la Paix. Le Grand Vizir fait tout ce qu'il peut pour ramasser des grandes sommes d'Argent, & de re∣dresser les finances: C'est pourquoy qu'il a retranché une partic du train du Gr. Seig∣neur, & fait une Inquisition fort exacte sur les gages des Officiers, & Soldats: Mais il fait encor fort peu des Preparations pour se mettre de bonne heure en Cam∣pagne. On n'equipperà par mer que fort peu des Vaisseaux de guerre, & comme on dit, seulement dix, avec 25 Galeres: Aus∣si a't on pris la resolution de ne se servir pas cette année des Pirates de Barbarie. Je demeure, &c. Monsieur, De V. Excellence le Tres humble Serv. COLYER. A Pera di Const. ce 15 Fevr. 1691. Lettre de Monsieur Colyer, Ambassadeur d'Hollande à Constantinople. Monsieur, MA derniere étoit du 15 de Fevrier, de la quelle j'ay joint icy la duplique, ayant envoyée la principalle par mer, par Venise. Depuis ce tems là le Gouverneur de Belgrade avertit la cour icy de l'arrivée du nouveau Ambassadeur d' Angleterre Monsieur Hussey à Esseck, & demanda pour luy permission pour poursuivre son Voy∣age par Belgrade jusques icy: & combien∣que l'Ambassadeur de France ayt fait tout ce qu'il à peu pour l'empecher, le Prime-Vizir neanmoins a expedié d'icy un Aga par poste à Belgrade susdit, le dernier du Fevrier, avec des ordres, de recevoir le dit Seigneur Hussey proche d'Esseck, & de le conduire & defrayer jusques à Constanti∣nople: De sorte qu'on l'attend icy apres Pâques. J'attens l'arrivée du dit Seigneur, avec beaucoup d'impatience, avec esperance certaine d'en entendre l'Etat des Affaires de la Chrêtienté. Cet Ambassadeur de France retient àpre∣sent toutes les Lettres addresées aux An∣glois & Hollandois, qui sont icy, & à Smyr∣ne, comme aussi celles, qui appartiennent aux Ministres publiques de ces deux Nati∣ons, lesquelles nous viennent par les vais∣seaux Francois, ou sous le pavillon de France, Il arrête aussi tous leurs effects: Mais le Grand Vizir étant par mes plaintes informé
de ces Insolences, s'en est montré fort mal content, & a ordonné au Doüanier d'y prendre garde tresexacte. Ce qu'étant en∣tendu par l'Ambassadeur de France, il a re∣tenu quelques effects, & Argent contant, qu'on avoit recommandé icy de Venise aux Marchands Anglois & Hollandois, avec le vaisseau San Joseppe, Cap. Luigi Juliano nouvellement icy arrivé. Mais on m'assure apresent, qu'on ne laisserà pas partir ce vaisseau d'icy, avant que d'avoir restitué tout ce qu'on a arrêté, aux proprietaires: Ce qui ferà, que le dit Ambassadeur en recevrà une petite Morti∣fication. Le 4 de ce mois on envoya d'icy à Jam∣bol, par ordre de la Cour, quelques Offici∣ers, qui en ramenerent le 10 un Prince Tartare, nommé Saadet Jeray, pour suc∣ceder au Han des Tartares, qui fut depos∣sedé le même jour de sa dignité. Le jour Suivant le Grand Vizir presenta le dit Prince au Grand Seigneur; & fut il cou∣ronné, mais avec fort peu de Ceremonies, Empereur de Tartarie, & renvoyé le 18 à la Crim, pour mettre ordre necessaire sur les Affaires, avec un commandement ex∣pres, de faire une Invasion en la Po∣logne. On dit, que ce changement est arrivé à cause, que le vieux Han a taché de divertir le Grand Vizir contre le Sentiment du tout le conseil de guerre, de s'en aller en personne en Campagne, afin de ne hazar∣der pas derechef la reputation de cet Em∣pire, puisqu'il ne pouvoit pas assurer laPorte de la secourir avec ses Trouppes Tartares, parce qu'on y attendoit, & craignoit, l'ar∣rivement de l'Armée Moscovite: & que les Albanois, ou Arnottes, auroient assez à faire de garder leur propre païs, menacé par les armes victorieuses des Venitiens: & qu'ainsi ces Trouppes ne se pouvans joindre avec l'Armée capitale des Turcs, on seroit contraint de se servir & contenter des seules Trouppes ordinaires des Janissaires & des Spahis, avec celles d'Asie; lesquel∣les jointes ensemble ne seroient en aucune maniere suffisantes pour resister à l'Armée Imperialle. C'est pourquoy le Han des Tartares étoit d'avis, qu'on feroit mieux de garder Seulement les frontieres par des Se∣raskiers Particuliers, & que le Grand Vizir les pourroit soutenir de tems en tems de Constantinople, ou d'Adrianople avec des Trouppes fraiches & nouvellement levées: & que de cette maniere on defendroit aise∣ment non seulement les Frontieres, mais aussi la reputation des armes du Grand Seigneur. Et parceque cet avis, ou conseil, du Han des Tartares fut rejetté, & resuté par le Kiahaia Bei, ou Lieutenant General des Janissaires, & de ceux de sa faction, avec des autres raisons, lequel Lieutenant est à present en Fort Grand Credit à la Cour, & que le Han s'en fachoit, on a, apres qu'il fút sorty du Conseil, arrêté de le demettre de sa dignité. Ce qu'étant peu apres en∣tendu du Grand Han, il renonca le lende∣main au Governement de la Crim, pour pre∣venir cet affront: & il demande apresent la permission de faire le pelerinage de Mecca. Le Grand Vizir ne fait que se preparer à la Guerre: Mais selon ce qu'on en peut juger, il ne serà pas aux Frontieres avant la sin du Juillet. C'est pourquoy que je m'imagine, que l'Armée Imperialle feroit un grand coup, & causeroit une grande Confusion dans les Trouppes Turques, si elle se mettroit de bonne heure en Cam∣pagne. Je vous puis assurer, Monsieur, que, si on n'entreprend pas quelque chose de con∣sideration dans cette Campagne contre les Turcs, & Francois, on n'aurà pas même sujet de penser seulement à la Paix: Mais au contraire, si l'on aurà le moindre avan∣tage contre cette Nation, qu'elle abandon∣nerà le partie Francois, & rechercherà la Paix incontinent. Il est donc tres-necessaire, que l'Armée Imperialle soit la premiere en Campagne, & qu'elle previenne les desseins du Grand Vizir: D'où on tirerà toutes les avantages imaginables. Les mauvais succes de la Campagne pas∣sé ont extremement avancé icy le credit de l'Ambassadeur de France, & au Contraire fort diminué le respect & la reputation des Ambassadeur d'Angleterre & d'Hollande: & principalement à l'egard de l'esquadre des Vaisseaux de Guerre, qu'on attendoit dans la Mer Mediterranée, du quel Mes∣sieurs les Etats Generaux m'avoient fait a∣vertir: Mais puisqu' on n'en a aucunes nouvelles, & qu'on même n'en ose pas parler d'avantage, cela fait, qu'on donne l'entier credit aux vanteries des Francois: De sorte que les Turques commencent à se persuader que le Roy de France a assez des Forces pour non seulement faire de resi∣stance aux tous les autres Princes Chêrti∣ens, mais encore de les attaquer par tout, & combattre. Dans ces jours passez arriverent icy quelques Deputez de la Valachie pour faire leurs plaintes au Grand Vizir, que le
Teckely faissoit des terribiles ravages avec ses gens dans leur Province: & le prierent d'y mettre des ordres necessaires, & d'avoir de la Compassion pour un païs desolé, & tout afait appauvrie. On leur à donné des belles paroles de la part du Teckely, & pour le reste accordé quelques demandes, qui concernoient leurs autres griefs. Le Chef de cette Deputation est l'Oncle de l'Hospodar, qui m'a prié d'assurer par vôtre entremise sa Majesté Imperialle de la fidelité & tres humbles soumissions de son Cousin, lequel n'a de plus Grand desir, que de rendre quelque Service considerable à sa Majeste ce qu'il espere de faire voir la Campagne prochaine. Cependant le dit Seigneur me pria instamment, de prier V. Excellence de luy faire cette grace, si cela se pouvoit faire, & d'obtenir, par son intercession, que son frere le Seigneur Georgio Cantacuzeno qui est apresent à Vienne, eut la permission, de se retourner dans son païs: Puisqu'il n'y peut rendre aucune Service à sa Majesté & qu'au con∣traire étant de retour chez soy il pourroit étre employé dans toutes les occurrences pour servir dans les Negotiations entre le General de la Transylvanie & l'Hospodar. Vous me ferez donc, Monsieur, un tres grand plaisir, si vous pourriez obtenir cette permission, si cela se peut faire sans quel∣que prejudice aux Affaires de l'Empire: Puisque je seray contraint d'oresenavant d'envoyer la pluspart de mes Lettres par la Valachie, la Transylvanie, & l'Hongrie, à Vienne, & de là en Hollande: Ce qui se pourrà faire tant plus aisement, parce que, comme on m'a averty, il y à une tresbonne correspondence entre le General Veterani, & le dit Hospodar de Valachie. Le Grand Vizir reüssit extremement bien dans toutes ses entreprises dans cet Empire, jusques à l'étonnement de tout le monde. Il a ces jours passez fait Gouver∣neur d'Ismit le Hassan Pascià, beaufils du dernier Sultan Mohamed, étant de retour de son Gouvernement d'Egypte: & celà pour luy ôter tout le credit, & autorité, luy donnant une charge de trespetite consi∣deration, & qui le mettrà hors des yeux & de la souvenance du peuple. Le même a inventé sur les Sujets Chre∣tiens & Juifs une Taxe par tête de dix, cinq, & de deux & demy ecus, les ayant divisez en trois sortes, des riches, de moyenne condition, & des pauvres; & oté toutes les autres Impositions: Ce qui luy ferà ramasser des tresgrandes sommes d'Argent. J'envoye cellecy par la Valachie, & la Transylvanie: & je vous prie, Monsieur, de me faire l'honneur par le même che∣min, d'un petit mot, de rescription: Ce que j'attendray avec impatience, demeu∣rant, Monsieur, Votre tres humble Serviteur, COLYER. A Pera di Constantino∣ple le derni∣er de Mars, 1691. In this manner Mr. Herbert came pro∣vided to Belgrade,Mr. Her∣bert at Belgrade. with Instructions for prosecution of the Treaty which Sir Wil∣liam Hussey had begun; but he soon found that the minds of the Turks were not as yet inclined to a Peace, and that all his labours and endeavours would prove inef∣fectual, whilst the Turks harkned to the Suggestions of the French, who had now got so far into their good Opinion, that their Interests being made the same, their Counsels could not be other than sincere, and their friendships of advantage; and therefore it was apparent to Mr. Herbert, that the Turks regarding no other Ambas∣sador but the French, resolved to take no other Methods than such as should be dictated by them. The case being thus manifest, struck Mr. Herbert to the heart, who was a hot-spirited, and a passionate man, and not able to endure to see that a Frenchman, which lately came from France, named Monsieur Marquis de Lorain, placed in the Affections of the Grand Vizier, with design to thwart him in all his Ne∣gotiations, he grew so impatient, that his blood boyl'd within him, to such a de∣gree, as Fevour'd him into a kind of Madness, which joyn'd with his old Ene∣my the Gout,His Death. he died thereof on the 31st of July, 1692.Old Style. The death of these two Ambassadors, so near the time to each other, seemed as if there had been a kind of fatallity in the Treaty of Peace; or that the French had by unlawful means contrived the death of these Ministers: but for my part,Reflexions on the Death of the two English Ambassa∣dors. I have no belief or jea∣lousie thereof; not but that the French may be ready enough to enter into such secret Machinations, where the Interest of their Monarch may be advanced; but like as the Devil, when he hath catched a Sinner close within his Clutches, is not very hasty to bring him to his end, so the French who had wholly possessed them∣selves of the minds and humours of the
Turks, had no need of having recourse to facinorous actions which were detestable to God and Man. And thus did the Marquis de Loran remain with the Vizier at Belgrade, whilst the late Ambassador Monsieur de Chauteauneuf returned by or∣der of the King into France. The Campagne (as we have said) being ended, nothing of action happened du∣ring the residence of the Vizier at Bel∣grade,The Grand Vizier at Belgrade. who kept himself wholly on the defensive; and lest the Germans should think fit to attack his Forces which lay encampt on the other side of the Rivers near Belgrade, he made two Bridges, one over the Save, and the other over the Danube; over which, upon news that the Christians were advancing, he caused his Army to retreat, and to pass the Bridges into the Town, where their Head-quarters were kept during the Winter season; and thus all Military Actions ceasing, license was given to the Militia of Anatolia to return home about the 20th of October un∣to their own Countries; the which was more readily granted, in regard to the great Mutinies, and Insurrection of the People in the Lesser Asia, and to the Vene∣tian Successes at Sea in the Archipelago. During the whole course of this Years Actions the Venetians were unprosperous, their Design upon Canea failing them; which they had streightly besieged for the space of a full Month; and had hopes of carry∣ing the Place, had not a Thousand French,A thousand French desert the Venetian Service. leavied for Service of the Veneti∣ans, deserted, and at their first landing gone over to the Turks; by whose assistance the Venetians were obliged most shamefully to raise the Siege, with the loss of many Men, and of most of their Cannon; which was the substance, and sum of all their Expedition for this Year, 1692. About the end whereof the Grand Seig∣nior had two Sons born to him, who were Twins, the one named Ibrahim, and the other Selim; on which occasion great re∣joycing being shown,Fires in Constan∣tinople. amidst thereof a dreadful fire happened at Constantinople, which began at Balasa, and consumed a∣bove 4000 Houses, with about 2000 Shops. This Fire happened in three several places of the City; one of which being near the Great Mosche of Sultan Soliman, one of the Menarees or Steeples thereof fell to the ground, which the People interpreted for an evil Omen, and Presage for the suc∣ceeding Year. The Grand Vizier being returned from the War towards the end of October, gave an account to the Grand Seignior of the state of the War, and that he had given the Command of the Army unto Lame Hu∣saein Pascia, and odered him with 10000 men to watch the Motions of the Ene∣my, and especially to take care of Temes∣waer▪ Anno 1693. THIS Year begins with the Death of the deposed Sultan Mahomet IV. who died of a Dropsie on the 4th of Ja∣nuary, 1693,  which had like to have pro∣duced a Peace; for the great Officers of the Empire being at that time assembled together at Adrianople,Debates about a Peace. a Council was held, in which it was debated and con∣cluded, that the present state of the Otto∣man Empire was such as required a Peace: Howsoever another Party prevailed, exci∣ted by the French Ambassador, who very liberally dispensed his Presents amongst the Military Men, in whose Hands at that time remained the Balance of War and Peace; the which was actuated by two different Principles, the one by the Presents given by the French, and by the Arrival of several French Officers, Engineers, Gun∣ners, Artificial Fire-workers, and some Money distributed amongst the Chief Tur∣kish Officers for carrying on the War. On the other side the Mediators, as the En∣glish, and Hollanders, whose Business it was to procure a Peace, seemed to over-act their Parts, and by their Sollicitations, and earnest Importunities, enhansed the Price thereof, and made the Turks believe, that either the Emperor could not subsist with∣out a Peace, or that some Fraud lay couch∣ed under such Specious and Importunate Pressures. My Lord Paget (as we have said) arri∣ving at Adrianople the 31st of January,March. and having receiv'd his first Audiences with the Grand Seignior, and Vizier, he had another on the 14th of March following in Company with the two Ambassadors of Holland, Heemskirk and Colyer, wholly re∣lating to the Peace, at which were present, the Chief Officers of the Empire; but no∣thing more was done, besides reading their Credentials publickly, with the Propositi∣ons; and so were dismissed for that time without a final Answer; telling them that they should receive the same in four or five Days; but on the 18th of this Month the Grand Vizier being displaced, (as was re∣ported) at his own seeking, Mustapha Pasha the Chimacam succeeded him in the Sub∣lime Office, so that all Matters of the Treaty were at a stand, and were to begin again; but for the better undersanding the true state of these Affairs, nothing can be more authentick and particular, than what was
Written in a Letter from Mr. Coke the Se∣cretary to Sir William Trumball, which was as followeth. The Copy of a Letter from Mr. Coke, to Sir William Trumball, late Ambassador with the Grand Seignior. Adrianople 28. May O. S. 1693. AS to the Negotiations of Peace, I know it will be no surprize to hear they are in the same state as you left them. For my part I was too short-sighted to discover those great Inclinations in the Port towards it, which Seignior Colyer represented, which had made such Impressions in Seignior Heemskirk, that upon Mr. Herbert's Death, he came fly∣ing with a full Sail down the Danube, not to begin the Treaty, but conclude the Peace; and thought it was so easie, that it was only to speak with the Vizier, and the Business was done. He arrived at Belgrade the first of Octo∣ber S. V. 1692, the next Day had Audience of the Vizier, and the third he gave in Wri∣ting to Mauro Cordato to Translate and give the Vizier his Proposals for a Peace or Truce for 30 Years: The substance of which for the Emperor was on the Foot of Uti possidetis; under which Notion Transylvania to retain to him, each liberty to fortifie in their Confines; Teckely to be delivered up; the Republick of Ragusa not to be called to Accounts for Ar∣rears of Tribute, or for the future pay any to the Port: For Poland, Restitution of Ca∣minieck, and with-hold in Podolia, all U∣crania, the Castelli on the Borysthenes, Moldavia, and Wallachia; and if the Tar∣tars made any Incursions into their Territories, the Port to pay the Damages that Crown re∣ceiv'd: For Venice, the Province of Leva∣dia, Athens and Thebes to be given them as an Equivalent for the Morea, and in like manner several Territories on the side of Le∣panto, and in Dalmatia: He expected an Answer to this, and that the Port would change their Old Style of receiving Proposals, and making none, into an open Negotiation by Writing; but he found all this imaginary, and not to be reduced to Practice. Mauro Cordato told him, These Proposals were injurious to the Empire; and ask'd, If he had no other to make? The Reply was, He had no more to say, till he had an Answer to what he had already proposed, which he had earnestly pressed for many Days in six Letters to Mauro Cordato: The Anser was, The Vizier was returning to Adrianople, and must acquaint the Grand Seignior with what passed, and he must go thither for his An∣swer. This startled him, who thought to have concluded the Treaty at Belgrade, and imme∣diately return'd, so he pressed for an Answer, or to be dismissed; but was told, He could not devest himself of his Character, which remained till my Lord Paget arrived, to whom Accidents might happen, as had to o∣ther Ambassadors, so he was forced to go by the Danube to Rusic, and so to Adrianople, where he arrived the 24th of November, departing from Belgrade the 23d of Octo∣ber. When he arrived first at Belgrade, Mar∣quis D'Orat, who was with Teckely and the French, said, He was no Englishman, but a German, and came from the Emperor. The Port had been sensible it was too great a Con∣descension to send their Ambassadors at Vi∣enna; which Point of Honour they thought regain'd, by having one come to make Over∣tures to them, and a particular Minister for that Business in their Hands, whom perhaps they may not easily part with. When Seignior Heemskirk was come to Adrianople, he would have Visited the Chi∣macam, who excus'd it, the Grand Vizier not being arrived, who came the 2d of Decem∣ber, and a few Days after an Audience was desired of him, which he put off, as not ha∣ving discoursed with the Grand Seignior. A private Council was held, Orders sent out to all parts for raising Men, and to the Treasu∣rer to give Money for providing Cannon, Am∣munition, and all things necessary, to be ear∣ly in the Field. The Stassaki-Aga was sent to the Tartar Han, with Money to be distribu∣ted among them to meet the Grand Vizier with a considerable Force at Belgrade. Seignior Heemskirk continued his Sollici∣tations all December, and the beginning of January, by his own Druggerman, to the Vi∣zier's Kiah, and by Letters to Mauro Cor∣dato; and wrote a Complaining Letter to the Vizier of his being come hither for an Answer, and after so long time, and being come so far nothing was done. To which he was answer'd by Word of Mouth, never in Writing, That my Lord Paget being come to Belgrade,Lord Paget ar∣rives at Adriano∣ple. and in his way hither, it was thought fit in a Council to attend his Arrival, to see if he brought no other Proposals; for if they were the same, one Answer would serve them both.
The sixth of January Seignior Colyer came to Adrianople against the Desire of Seignior Heemskirk, who wrote to him not to come; and at first there was great Coldness between them, and Tyles was never employed by Seignior Heemskirk. The last of January, his Excellency my Lord Paget arrived; he would have enter'd pri∣vately, but the Vizier desired the contrary, that it might not be thought the Port had wanted in their Respect to him, and his Lord∣ship was received with a great deal of Cere∣mony, and Numerous Attendance of Chiauses and Janisaries. His Audi∣ences.The 18th of February his Excellency had his first Audience of the Grand Vizier, and gave him his Credentials, one for his Resi∣dence, the other for the Mediation. The seventh of March his Lordship had his Audience of the Grand Seignior, and was ve∣ry kindly received: He spoke his Complement, which was Interpreted by Mauro Cordato; and the Grand Seignior answered, That His Majesty was a good Friend to the Port, and all such should be ever kindly received by him. The seventeenth of March, his Excellency had a private Audience of the Vizier, where was the Mufti. His Lordship made the Offers of His Majesty's Mediation for a Peace, or Truce between the Emperor, and his Allies, and the Port, on the Foot of Uti possidetis, only Caminieck to be restored, or razed. The Vizier said in a Business of so great Import, he must consult the Heads of the Law, and the Militia, and an Answer shou'd be gi∣ven. The 14th ditto, his Excellency Signior Heemskirk, and Colyer, were called to the Vizier to a Publick Audience, where on the Safra sate the Vizier, the Mufti and Cade∣lesker on his Left Hand; on his Right the Chimacam, Ismael Passa Janisar-Aga, the Nisangi Passa, and the Tefterdar, and the three Ambassadors, the two Generals on Stools; below the Safra, the Kiah-Beg and all the Heads and Ojacks of the Janisaries, the two Generals, chief of the Spahy's, and chief of the Treasury; in all near 100 Per∣sons: The Rais Effendi came into the middle of the Safra, and read aloud Signior Heem∣skirk's Proposals, which he owned. This was done only to exasperate the Militia: The Vizier said, They must consider of them, and give an Answer. The 17th the Vizier was turned out, and his Excellency finding the Vizier had his Design in Irritating the People by such Ex∣travagant Demands, went to the new Vizier, Mufti, Cadelesker, and Janisar-Aga, telling them these Proposals read were none of his, which was only one plain Proposition on a Uti posseditis, which His Majesty thinking equal, was willing to interpose his Offices thereon, if the Port thought fit, out of real Friendship. The Vizier said, They would consider of it, and give an Answer. The Mufti said, The coming of three Embassadors had rais'd great Expectations in the People, and they could do no less than make known what Proposals had been made: They were very well satisfied of His Majesty's Friendship. The Cadelesker and Tefterdar said, Without Restitution of the Morea, there could be no Peace. The Janisar-Aga, who was come from Constanti∣nople said he had seen the Proposals, That God would humble the Pride of the Enemy, and chastize it, he hop'd, this Year. But his Excellency Lord Paget, had vin∣dicated himself clearly to all Ministers, as his Proposal was, but the other was sent over all the Empire to prepossess the People; but SigniorInterpre∣ter. Tyles had set all right in three Days. It is observable, when Signior Heemskirk had no Intimacy with Tyles, he wrote to my Lord Paget in January, and to the Empe∣ror, there was no hopes of Peace; but when he came into a Familiarity with Tyles, he was Illuminated, and in March wrote His Majesty, the Peace was in a fair way, and he hoped to be himself the bringer of the News of it; and yet now Tyles says to us, in eight Months he has been here, they have never done any thing, and the Port will not have Peace, nor were inclin'd to it. Signior Heemskirk was much Embroil'd, and pressed my Lord Paget much to sollicite the Vizier with Memorials; but his Excel∣lency had seen so ill Effects of his Writing, that he thought it much better to seem Indif∣ferent, than Importune, and to attend their Answer to his Proposal.
Extract of my Lord Paget's Letter to a Friend, of the same Date with the pre∣ceding. NOTWITHSTANDING all their seeming Reluctancies, and high Words, I am of Opinion the Turks may be perswaded to hearken to Peace, especially if the Imperial Army do any thing to purpose this Summer: The State here is shortly thus. This present 7th of June, N. S. the Jani∣sar-Aga is not yet gone into the Camp, nor will he go (as I think this 10 Days: About a Week after him the Grand Vizier goes; and about a Fortnight after that, the Army will begin to March. It is not at present strong, not of above 5 or 6000 Men, but the Asiaticks and Tar∣tars are to joyn them at Sofia: How many they may be is very uncertainly reported; the first however will not be Numerous; they rec∣kon upon 20000 Tartars, that will be their greatest Strength, and these altogether can∣not be at Belgrade till the latter end of July at soonest; so that if the Imperial Army be as strong and as ready, as when I came from Vienna, I thought it would be, they will have time enough to attempt any thing, before these Forces can appear to hinder them. And such was the true State of Affairs at this time in the Ottoman Court in relati∣on to a Peace. The Ambassadors Heemskirk, and Colyer's Letter to the Emperor touching the Peace.

HEEMSKIRK. COLYER. Adrianop. 31 May, 1693. All thoughts of Peace, and Treaties, being thus laid aside, the Government em∣ployed its utmost Endeavours, and Coun∣sel were taken in Matters and Contrivan∣ces tending to the War: It was reported, That the Grand Seignior, Sultan Achmet, had resolved to go as far as Sophia, where he would pass the Summer, being nearer to Belgrade, and the Frontiers in Hungary; but the Physicians perswaded the contra∣ry, as being prejudicial to the Health of the Sultan, who was already affected with the Dropsie, (the fatal and common Dis∣ease of that Ottoman Family) for Cure of which,Sultan Achmet sick of the Dropsie. many Consultations were held by the Physicians; who, in regard that they found as yet a Schirrus only upon the Li∣ver, they gave great hopes of his Reco∣very; howsoever the People took occasi∣on from hence to discourse, That in case this Sultan Achmet were Dead, he would be succeeded by Sultan Mustapha his Ne∣phew, and Son to the late Sultan Mahomet, who had been Deposed: which would be a happy Change for the whole Empire, he being Young and Brave, and as to all ap∣pearance, of a Martial Spirit, and a Lo∣ver of Justice. To forward the Preparations for the War with all Expedition possible,Preparati∣ons for the War. strict Orders were given to provide Caminieck with Provisions, and necessary Food, for want of which, the Place laboured under the greatest Extremity. Letters also, and Commands were dis∣patched to all Parts in Asia, to hasten the March of the Janisaries and Spahees, and to enroll new Janisaries, a Method not u∣sed in former Times; by which, taking every Pitiful Fellow that offered to come in, they composed such a Band of raw Sol∣diers, not only unexperienced in War, but Poor, and Feeble, and Old, that scarce one half of them were judged able to hold out a March to Belgrade. The Turks also dispatched away 2000 Janisaries to reinforce the Garrison at Ne∣gropont; likewise they reinforced Canea with Men and Provisions; as they also did their Army in and about the Morea, and strengthned their Castles at the Dardanelli, with Soldiers, Gunners, and Engineers, under Command of Husaein Pasha, who had formerly been Chimacam with the Grand Seignior, but the Troops designed for Hungary, marched slowly. These Pre∣parations being much retarded by the late Change of those two great Officers, name∣ly, the Grand Vizier, who, as we said, voluntarily resigned, and the Tefterdar,Changes at Court. or Lord Treasurer, called Ismael Effendi Ma∣tulled, or put out, Disgraced, and Exiled; tho' some reported, That he was secretly Strangled; which was a strange, and an unseasonable Policy at such a time as this, to put all things backward by the Death of two prime Officers of State, who perhaps were Innocent, and Good Ministers: But under such a Government as this, it is not sufficient to be Wise, Honest, and Indu∣strious, but you must also be Successful, and free of Enemies, which are things not in our power. By these Changes, place was made for other Officers; for Osman Pasha, a Cun∣ning, Knavish Candiot (as most of that Nation are) was made Chimacam in Adrianople. Mustapha Pasha, who had been Chimacam, and Seraskier on the Danube was declared Grand Vizier; and Cantemir the Son of Dica Bey, who had for 30 Years past been Prince of Moldavia, was made Successor to his Father. This Grand Vizier, before he could be warm in his Place, or provided with things necessary for the War, or acquainted with his Soul∣diery,
and the Chief Commanders, which were to fight under him, was commanded to be gone with all expedition to the Ar∣my;The New Vizier snt to the Amy. which he prepared to do with what speed was possible. And in regard that all intentions for Peace were laid aside,May. The Media∣tors dismis∣sed. the Mediators were dismissed from their further Attendance, and Mr. Heemskirk was licensed to return to Vienna; tho' some difficulties arose thereupon at the instance of the French, who suggested, that Heems∣kirk was an Instrument, and Spye of the Emperor, and a German; and not sent as a Mediator from the King of England, whose true Minister my Lord Paget was: And this colour had like to have cost Heemskirk dear, had not my Lord Paget own'd him for a Minister of the King, and unridled the Secret of the two Ambassa∣dors. In like manner my lord Paget had leave to go to his House at Pera near Con∣stantinople, which is the usual place of the English Ambassadar's residence. But as to the French Ambassador he continued still at Adrianople; and when the Vizier marched, he sent Fontaine his Dragoman, or Interpreter with him to attend all the Motions of the Vizier, and his Camp. Whilst these things were in Action, the news from Asia was unpleasing, and ad∣ministred Matter for serious Considerati∣on at the Ottoman Court; where it was reported, That the Army of Bassora, un∣der their New Arabian Prince did daily increase, and that the Pasha of Sivas, or Sebasse, on the Frontiers of Persia were in Arms; and that such was the confusion in those Eastern Countries, as obliged the most powerful of the Asiatick Spahees to remain at home on the guard of their own Country and Estates; so that the pre∣sent Ottoman Force was inferiour to that of the preceding year; and by reason of the forementioned Changes; to which we may farther add, that of the Seimen Pa∣sha, who was Lieutenant General of the Janisaries, and advanced to be Aga, or General of the Janisaries, in the place of Ismael Pasha. Likewise divers Captains, who had been Creatures and Favourites of the late General, were deprived of their Commands, least they should make De∣sturbances, or raise Factions in the Army; all which, as it diminished and enfeebled their Force, so it hindered the early ap∣pearance of the Turks in the Field. Preparati∣ons for the Seas.But the Preparations at Sea against the Venetians proceded more briskly than they did at Land; for in the Month of May, 22 Sail of Gallies, and 13 Great Men of War were provided and sitted out of the Arsenal at Constantinople, and ordered to sail down to the Castles of the Darda∣nelli, there to join with the Gallies of the Beyes of the Archipelago; to which some Ships of the Barbarouses being added, they computed, that they might form a Fleet of 24 Sail of Men of War, besides Gal∣lies. Things proceding thus slowly by Land, for the Causes before-mention'd, the Vizier did not begin his March from Adrianople towards the Christians, until the 26th of June Old Syle, designing at first for Bel∣grade; when on a sudden,The Vizier begins his march from Adri∣anople. express Orders were given to the Army to change the course of their March, and leave the Road to Belgrade, and take that for Valachia, and through that Country to enter into Transilvania: This alteration was the more surprising to the Germans, who expected not the Turks on that side, because it was not known above a Week or 10 Days be∣fore the departure of the Vizier, the which Counsel was judged to have been given by the French Ambassador, or other∣wise by the Tartars, who propounded to the Vizier to join him on the way with such a Force, as should make up his Ar∣my at least 80000 Men. But whilst these Matters were consult∣ing, news came that the Germans had a design to lay siege to Belgrade; and on their way thither had designed against the Palancha's of Jeno, and Julia, and threat∣ned the Turks with devastations over all the plain Countries; and since the taking of Great Waradin, streightned Temeswaer with want of Provisions; which put the Turks into some confusion both at home and abroad, and diverted entirely the de∣sign of the Turks upon Transilvania, where the most mischief might have been done on the Imperial Dominions; because Tran∣silvania hath ever been esteemed the most convenient Door to let the Turks into Ger∣many. But what about the same time also caused some desturbances at home, was a Terrible Conflagration which happened at Constantinople;Fire at Constan∣tinople. the Fire began first in the Street called Zubali, where they make the Musquets, and all sorts of Arms for the Grand Seignior's service, destroying all the Forges, and Instruments belonging to that Work; and the fire taking its way, consumed all before it, until it came to the great Capan, which is the chief, and only Magazine for Flour, and Corn, and all Provisions whatsoever, laid up for the Use of the City; and afterwards taking up the Hill, it took its course down by the way of Balata, and consumed at least
a third part of that Division, so that the Turks report, that above 20000 Shops, and Houses were consumed. This great Conflagration being over, People began to enquire after the News which the Expresses brought from the Ar∣mies, from all parts; and particularly that from Asia was of considerable importance; giving a Relation, that the New Arab Prince, Emir by Name, who reckned his Descent in a Direct Line from their Pro∣phet Mahomet, brought an Army into the Field, pretending to make himself Sove∣raign of Bassora, to which he had an He∣reditary Right, and Title: His Army daily increasing, obliged the Grand Seig∣nior to send many of his Troops out of Europe under the Command of the Pasha of Bosnia to reinforce the Militia of those Countries. The European Generals being unac∣quainted with the Situation,July. and qualities of those Countries, and not knowing that in the Month of July the Rivers upon the melting of the Snows swell to a prodigi∣ous heighth, were strangely surprized to find themselves without any cause, or knowing how it came about, in the midst of a deep Water: For being encamped in the Vally of a flat Country, the Arabs opened their Sluces, and having made some Channels like Aquaeducts, they let so great a Flood of Waters out of the Neighbouring Rivers into the Turkish Camp,The Turks in Asia drowned in the Waters. that before the Turks understood from whence that Inundation proceded, 6 or 7000 of them were drowned, and the rest being put into confusion, and en∣deavouring to save themselves, fell into the hands of the Arabs, and were all cut in pieces, or made Prisoners; only the Pasha of Bosnia with 14 more escaped of all that multitude: And soon after this de∣feat the Arabs attacked, and took a Cara∣van, with the Spoils of which they en∣riched themselves. The news of this Defeat very much dis∣couraged the Turks in Europe, having lost by this accident 25000 Men of their own Friends and Acquaintance, which became the more sensible to them at that time, when the Turkish Army became so feeble in Hungary, that had not the Tartars as∣sisted them with great Numbers, the Vi∣zier would have been forced to return home with Confusion, and Dishonour. The Tartars being made sensible of the great need that the Turks had of them, stood the more strongly on their Terms, and made some difficulties of joining with them, but at length suffered themselves to be worked upon, when they saw the rich Presents which the Grand Signior had sent to the New Tartan Han, to engage him to come early this Year into the Field; and when they saw the rich Vests lined with Sables, and the Sword set with great Diamonds, with 40000 Zaichins in Mo∣ny, they needed no other Rhetorick, or persuasive Arguments to prevail upon them, but all unanimously prepared to make an early Campagne. Upon the news that the Christians de∣sign'd to besiege Belgrade, the Vizier hast∣ned his march thither; where by reason of the many losses which that Garrison had sustained, a Recruit was sent of 1000 men out of Bosnia, and 2000 Arnouts to re-inforce the Garrison. And also 15000 Turks more were detached from the Army in Bos∣nia to recognize, or take a view of the Chri∣stian Forces in those Countries; and having passed the Save over three several Bridges, came and shewed themselves before Oseck, which was commanded by Lieutenant Co∣lonel Baron Ogiley: This Governor find∣ing himself unable to oppose the Turks in the Field, kept himself within his Bul∣warks and Fortifications; until the Turks having at their leisure taken a view of the Place, and Country round about, retired back-towards Belgrade, plundering every thing they could carry with them, toge∣ther with Men, Women and Children, which they carried into slavery, to the number of about 3000 Souls. After which Ogiley drawing together a Body of about 800 select and choise Men, he pas∣sed the Save, and with them surpriz'd a Town called Bratzein, to which having given fire, 200 Turks were burn'd therein, and the like number endeavouring to save themselves from the flames; ran out of the City, of which near 100 men were killed on the Place; and many Christians lately taken by the Turks, were released, and sent back to their own Habitations. Since the taking of Great Waradin, Te∣meswaer, Giula, and Geno, were so streightned for want of Provisions, that they were forced to send away all Women, and Chil∣dren, and unnecessary Persons from the Places; the better to conserve the Victu∣als, and Provisions for the use of the Gar∣rison: For General Heusler having for some time blocked up Geno, he made a nearer approach to it;June. and on the 16th and 17th day of June placing his Camp within half a mile of the place, he attacked the Sub∣urbs, which were surrounded with a Ditch, and fortified with Palisadoes; howsoever the Germans forced the place and took it; the Turks retiring with much confusion in∣to the City. The next day being the 18th, General Heusler having received four pieces of Can∣non,
he fired with them into the City, and threw some Bombs thereinto; after which he summoned the Place, and threat∣ned them, that in case they did not im∣mediately surrender, he would afterwards give them no Quarter. But the Turks not hearkning hereunto, a Battery was rais'd, from whence the Guns fired without cea∣sing; and thereby in the space of five or six days a Breach being made, all matters were prepared for a Storm on the Place; which the Turks not daring to withstand, and adventure, they resolved to capitu∣late; and on the 27th hung out a White Flag, and sent out three of their Principal Men into the German Camp: Where en∣tring into a Treaty, it was agreed, that the next day one of their Gates, and Bul∣warks should be delivered up into the Hands of the Besiegers; which being per∣formed the following day, the Garrison of the Turks consisting of about 800 fighting Men, with 200 Horse, were convoyed within half an hour's march from Lippa. This City was provided with four Bul∣warks, fortified with a high and strong Wall, broad and deep Ditches, into which the River Kerez hath a passage; and with∣in it hath another retreat fortified with four Towers. In this Place the Germans found 35 Brass, and three Iron Guns, with other Warlike Stores, as 20000 pounds of Powder, and other Ammunition pro∣portionable. In this Siege, within the Town, 350 Men were killed, and wound∣ed. Immediately after the surrender of Geno, General Heusler invested the strong For∣tress of Philagoras, situated between Geno and Lippa, which yielded unto him; and having repaired the Breaches of Geno, and placed a small Body of Men in those parts, under the Command of General Hoskir∣ken, he returned to Great Waradin with his remaining Forces. The Grand Vizier being on his march to Belgrade, the news of what had hap∣pened at Geno, and Philagoras was brought to him; and thereby suspecting that Te∣meswaer would be the next enterprize of Heustler, dispatched immediately Orders to the Pasha of Belgrade to send another Convoy, and more Troops thither to re-inforce the Garrison of Temeswaer with Men and Provisions. But the Pasha with several other Commanders refusing to obey, upon certain pretences, that such a De∣tachment would be the Ruin of the Place, and that to save Temeswaer, they should lose Belgrade; the Vizier became so enra∣ged, that with his own Hand he killed six of the Principal Turks,July 11. who were Com∣plices with the Pasha, and left their Dead Bodies in the Streets to the view and ter∣ror of others. Whilst these things passed at Belgrade, the Duke of Croy, who commanded the Imperial Army, prepared all necessaries to besiege the Place. And in the first place he caused a Bridge to be laid over the Danube at Veresmarton, of an hours jour∣ney in length; over which he passed one half of his Army, and the other half he transported in Ships and Boats, and were followed by the Hanover Troops, and the Artillery: And tho' he had by these means gotten together in a Body, yet many things were wanting to begin, and carry on the siege; to supply which, being en∣camped on the 25th of this Month near Peter Waradin, he dispatched an Express to some Brandenburgher Troops, which re∣mained in the Rear, to advance forwards, and hasten their march: And having as∣sembled a Council of War, it was resol∣ved forthwith to pass the Save over the Bridge of Peter Waradin, and proceed to Belgrade. And accordingly towards the end of this Month, marching with great diligence, the Hussars having the Van∣guard, surprized the Turks near Belgrade, of whom they took many Prisoners, with some Cattle, which they brought back into the Army; by which the Turks were so alarm'd, and by the march of the Im∣perial Army towards them, that they en∣deavoured to carry away, and save the best of their Goods, but the Imperial Horse prevented their design. The Christians approaching near the Turks on the first of August,August. began to fire on all sides from the Town; whilst the Germans on the contrary, were busily working on their Lines of Circumvallati∣on, had not finished any Battery until the fifth, when they likewise began to fire on the City. It was farther at that time de∣signed that two of the Christian Gallies, well armed, should drive away from before the Town some light Turkish Gallies, by which means that side lying open, they could easily encompass the City on all sides. On the ninth the Brandenburgher Troops joyned the Army, and on the same day, some Turks belonging to the Garrison of a Palanca called Boskoua,The Palan∣ca of Bos∣koua capi∣tulates. situated about three hours distance from the Army, came to the Camp, and offered to capitulate; the which being granted with such Con∣ditions as were proposed, the Fortress sur∣rendred, and the Soldiers and Inhabitants were convoyed safe to Semendria: In the Palanca they found nine Guns with some Ammunition, with good store of Hay and Corn.
On the 12th of this Month the Turks, to celebrate their Annual Feast of the Bai∣ram, fired all the Guns round the City and Castle; and the Day following made a brisk Sally with such Bravery, that at the first they brought the Germans into some Confusion; but rallying themselves again into good Order, they beat the Turks back into the City. The Turks make a Sally. Are driven in with loss.On the 14th they made another Sally more furious than the former, but with less Success, being repulsed with the loss of 500 Men killed and taken Prisoners: This Blow gave the Christians an advantageous Opportunity, in the space of two Days to advance their Approaches to 150 Paces from the Counterscarp. Another Sally.On the 17th another Sally was made by the Turks, but were repulsed with the loss of about 100 Men; by which the Ger∣mans advanced their Works within 80 Pa∣ces of the Counterscarp. And Bombs thrown in∣to the Town.On the 19th threw several Bombs into the City, which did great execution; and posted six Regiments on the other side of the Danube; by which all Succours coming to the Town from Temeswaer, or other Parts on that side, were hindred from gi∣ving any Relief; and the Turks Ships were bridled, and obliged to keep at a di∣stance. On the 26th the great Battery of 36 Guns was finished, from which the Besieg∣ers continually fired on the City, and the Turks again on the Battery, where the Duke of Croy standing open was shot through the Hat with a Musket-Bullet, and his Adjutant-General killed by his side with the like. The next Day being the 30th of August, Kathana Mustapha Pasha, with a Body of 300 Horse, Attacked the Emperor's advan∣ced Troops near Semblin, but were so re∣ceived by them, that 40 of them remain∣ed upon the Spot, several Wounded, and many made Prisoners.The Grand Vizier marches to relief of the Town. The same Day In∣telligence was brought to the Duke of Croy, That the Grand Vizier had drawn together from all Parts, as many Forces as he had been able to do, with Resolution to relieve the Town. On the last Day of August, the Chief Ingineer Keyserfelt entering the Trenches, was killed by a Musket-shot. Septemb.In the first six Days of September no∣thing was performed which was conside∣rable, but that the Approaches were still advancing;The Chri∣stians loss. so that on the 7th, the Besieg∣ers Stormed the Counterscarp, which con∣tinued until the going down of the Moon, when the Darkness of the Night put an end to the Assault, in which the Christians lost 1000 Men, killed and wounded, on the Place, and amongst them the Bavarian General Sybeldorf, with two Lieutenant-Colonels, and other Officers. The Ill Success that the Christians had sustained by the Storm made on the Coun∣terscarp, being the cause of Raising the Siege, it may be very proper to insert here a Relation, which a principal Officer gave thereof, who was present at the Attack made thereon the 7th of September 1693. in this manner. Whilst these things were acting, News came, That the Tartars had appeared in the Neighbourhood with a Body of 2000 Men, and had droven away with them some Cattle: And On the 10th Instant News was brought by several Expresses, That the Grand Vi∣zier with an Army of 80000 Men, was ar∣rived, together with a great Fleet of Ships and Gallies, before Wdin: Upon which News, and the sharp Blow received some few Days before, upon the Counterscarp of the Town, it much discouraged the Proceedings of the Germans: Upon which a Council of War being called, it was judg∣ed dangerous to expect the Arrival of so great an Army, or to attend and stand their Shock; and therefore it was conclu∣ded best to Decamp, and quit the Siege,The Siege of Bel∣grade rai∣sed. which accordingly was executed with good Order, and the whole Army drew off with Bag and Baggage, Guns, and all other Materials; and so passing the River Save, over the Bridge which they had made, they Burnt and Destroy'd it: And thus ended this Expedition with no small Charge and Expence of Blood and Men to the Em∣peror. In the Management of which, many Er∣rors and Blunders were committed: The Trenches were not opened until 13 Days after the Place was Invested; and that the Batteries were not ready until 13 Days af∣ter that: It was another Oversight, That the Fleet, which should have hindered all Provisions from the Town, coming from Temeswaer, was not ready before the Town was Invested; which was as ridiculous, as when the King of Denmark forgot his Mortars, going before Hamburg; and so were the Germans Cannon, which were not brought before the Town till five Weeks after it was Invested.
Còpie de la Relation envoyée à & sur l'assaut de la Con∣trescarpe de Belgrade, du 7 Septembre, 1693. QUOYQUE je n'aye pas manqué de rappresenter icy qu'il étoit dange∣reux de donner un assaut de Contrescarpe, quand elle se trouve encore eloignée plus de cent pas des approches, comme effe∣ctivement êtoit celle de Belgrade le 7 Sep∣tembre, parceque ceux qui portent la fas∣cine devant venir de si loin à decouvert sont la plus part tués ou blesséz avant qu'ils arrivent a la Pallisade, & par conse∣quent n'en peuvenr fournir assez, ny assez vite pour faire le Logement requis & sa Communication aux approches avant l'ar∣rivée du jour, outre que par cette grande distance on expose plus dangereux de com∣mencer le dit assaut aprés la nuit clause par les Raisons suivantes: Et I. Parceque nôtre Artilleric, & nos Fu∣seliers ne pouvant ajuster leurs coups aux Parapets, & defences de l'Ennemy ne sca∣vroient aussi l'empecher de plonger à decou∣vert son feu sur les assailants, & sur les tra∣vailleurs. II. Puisque nos Grenadiers par l'Obscurité ne voyant pas la contenance de l'Ennemy, ny pouvant reconnoítre sa foiblesse dans les postes, qu' il occupe pandant la Chaluer de l'assaut, ils n'ont pas lieu aussy de pro∣fiter du moindre avantage, que la Confu∣sion du d'Ennemy luy peut donner dans l'action, apres quoy il peut se remettre, & revenir a son devoir. III. Parceque les Turques ont accou∣teméz de redoubler la garde dans chacun de leurs postes pendant la nuit seulement. IV. Le Soldat, & bien souvent l'Officier ne se piquant pas d'une égale bravoure, quand ils ne sont pas observés de leurs su∣perieurs comme ils feroient s'ils agisoient pendant la lumiere, ils profitent souvent de la Moindre confusion pour se cacher ou se derober a leur devoir. V. Parceque le tems du travail deve∣nant par ce moyen plus court on né sca∣vroit se mettre a couvert sur la Pallisade par un bon Logement, ny faire la Commu∣nication en arriere avant l'arrivée du jour sans la quelle on seroit ensuite forcé par l'Ennemy d'abandonner le poste. On ne laissa neantmoins pas le jour 7 Septembre deux heures apres le soleil couché d'ordonner l'assaut de la Contre∣scarpe de cette place, qui fût disposé com∣me il s'en suit. A scavoir 400 Grenadiers avec deux Capitaines sous le commande∣ment du Baron de Flouk major du vieux Staremberg partagéz moitié à la gauche, & moité a la droite devoient donner depuis le Ravelin du Roy jusques a la Contregarde de la gauche de nôtre attacque soutenu par 200 Fusiliers, qui êtoient aussi commandéz par deux Capitaines, les quels devoient être secondés par 400 autres Fusiliers, a scavoir par 200 sous le commandement du Lieu∣tenant Colonel de Thaun, qui êtoit destiné a la droite, & sontenu par le Colonel Comte Marsigli avec deux Bataillons, & les autres 200 sous le commandement du Lieutenant Colonel d'Anali qui êtoit de∣stiné a la gauche soutenu par le Colonel Danois Stockamer avec deux autres Ba∣taillons. L'attacque sudit étant mené par le General Seiberstorf sous la direction, & commandement du General Comte Guido Staremberg. Ce qui fût executé immedi∣atement aprés le signal donné. Quand nos Grenadiers virent l'Ennemy qui fortit en même temps aussi de sa Pallisade, sur le Glacis vers l'ouvrage à Corne, chacun te∣nant un Flambeau allumé d'une main, & le sabre de l'autre pour les recevoir, mais poussez par la vigueur des nôtres, & par le grand feu qu'ils luy firent dessus il fút o∣bligé de rentrer au plus vite dans son che∣min couvert, & dans ses contre-approches, ou nos gens le chargerent avec une si grande quantité de Grenades, & le Fusil crevisé a la pallisade qu'ils en firent rester un grand nombre, sur la place, & le mirent partie en confusion, lors qu'on Capitaine des dits Grenadiers ayant fait dire a Monsieur le General Séiberstorf de luy envoyer du mon∣de pour le soutenir & pour faire le Loge∣ment sur la Pallisade; Le dit General luy fit respondre, qu'il scauroit bien luy en∣voyer tout cela, quand il seroit temps il êtant pas son Affaire d'entrer dans ces sor∣tes de dispositions, de maniere que nos Gens furent une grande heure & demy a decou∣vert sur la Pallisade, sans qu'on leur en∣voya ny les Fusiliers destinés pour les sou∣tenir, ny les travailleurs avec les Fascines, & Gabions pour les Loger, quoyqu'ils en fissent toutes les instances possibles, aprés quoy les dits 400 Grenadiers ne se trou∣vant plus fort qu'au nombre d'environ 150 le reste ayant êté tuéz ou blessés, on fit sortir les Fusiliers pour les soutenir; &
Monsieur le Comte Guido de Staremberg voyant la perte considerable de nôtres sans aucun fruit, commandà qu'on deut se reti∣rer de l'enterprise lors qu'on luy vint faus∣sement rapporter, que nos Gens s'etoient logéz à la gauche sur la Pallisade, ce qui luy fit suspendre sa resolution, ordonnant de continuer le travail, & dans ce tems là le Colonel Comte Marsigli sortit sur la droite pour le soûtenir avec ces deux Ba∣taillons, étant rentré un moment aprés a∣vec une Legere blessure a la jambe apres quoy Monsieur le Comte Guido ayant a∣pris que nos Gens sur la gauche bien loin d'être logés à la Pallisade, comme on luy avoit fait croire, avoient abandonné le tra∣vail, & qu' a la droite au Lieu d'avoir at∣taqué entre l'angle saillant du Ravelin du Roy, & la Contregarde du Côté de la Save, s'êtoient attachés entre le dit Ravelin & l'Ouvrage a Corne, contre la disposition faite, & toute raison, a cause du grand feu de Flanc & de Front, dont l'Ennemy les chargeoient, crut a propos avec le reste de la Generalité de faire retirer le monde se contentant de pousser un petit Zic Zac a∣vancé d'environ 20 pas hors de nôtre pa∣ralele êloignée encore plus de 60, pas de la Pallisade, qui n'êtoit qu'environ deux pieds profond, lors que le jour arrivá. Quoyque la bravoure de nos Gens alla jusques a l'opiniatreté celle des Ennemies fut assurement toute extraordinaire puisqu' il se deffendit avec une telle constance, & fit un feu du Mousquet si continué pendant deux bonnes heures, qu'on ne pouvoit di∣stinguer un coup de l'autre, outre les Bom∣bes, & Grenades, qu'il tirá sans cesse par∣ticulierement du chemin couvert entre l'ou∣vrage a Corne & le Ravelin du Roy, ou nos Gens attaquerent parme prise contre la disposition faite, & ou il y avoit trois Pallisades l'une devant l'autre, dont de la plus avancée l'Ennemy se deffendoit avec le Mousquet, de la seconde il jettoit des pier∣res, & de la troisiême des Grenades avec des Cuilleres sans discontinuer un mo∣ment. S'il est extraordinaire, qu'on aye man∣qué de faire un logement de Contrescarpe particulierement avec des si braves Gens, comme nous avions, il doit l'être encore plus qu'on n'aye pu reussir devant un En∣nemy, qui ne'n a jamais desfendu jusques a present, & on ne scauroit en attribuer la faute qu'a la mauvaise disposition a scavoir parceque on l'a attaquée de trop loin, que l'on a voulu attacquer la nuit contre les raisons adduites, que l'Artillerie n'a jamais tiré aux dessenses, & Pallisades des lieux que nous devions attaquer. Que les Inge∣nieurs (Particulierement Morado) Aban∣donnerent d'abord le poste. Que les Gre∣nadiers de la droit en attaquerent pas ou il∣falloit. Que ceux-cy, & ceux de la Gauché ne furent pas soutenus, & parceque ensi l'Ingenieur, qui avoit la direction du tra∣vail súr les autres ne sortit jamais sé fiant aux faux rapports qu'on luy falloit. Cependant si l malheur vouloit qu'il fallut quitter cette Place, il est constant que, Laissant a part la principale raison de n'a∣voir pas coupé a l'Ennemy la communicati∣on de la Riviere, Les Ingenieurs, & l'Ar∣tillerie ont par leur negligence, particuli∣erement contribués a cette perto, puisqu les premiers ont commencés travailler a la sappe êtant encore à 150 pas loin, fasant ainsi les paraleles, & 4 ou 5. Clôter d'ou∣vrage en 24 heurs, & les seconds n'ont ja∣mais voulu avancer leurs Batteries, on il falloit pour rompre les deffenses de l'Enne∣my, ny tirer cette quantite de Bombes, & Canons necessaries pour ruiner cette place, particulierement le jour de l'assaut susdit pendant le quel jour ils ne tirerent jamais ny aux Pallisades du Chemin couvert, ny aux deffences des Contreaproches, & pie∣ces, que nous devions attaquer, ce qui donna lieu a l'Ennemy de soutenir si bien ses Ouvrages, qui êtoient encore touts en∣tiers. L'on aura perdu dans cette assaut envi∣ron 1000 hommes, tant tuéz que blesses parmy les uqels il y a 254 Grenadiers bien comptéz & beaucoup d'Officiers, & entre autres Monsieur le General Seiber∣storf tué. Nous sommes environ 80 pas de la Pal∣lisade de la Place, de sort que Samedy 12 du mois nous serons en êtat d'attaquer la Contrescarpe une seconde fois qui ne re∣ussira pas mieux que la premiere, si les dispositions n'en seront meilleures. Ce matin 9 de Septembre, sur les 9 heures, les Tartares sont venus jusques à nôtre retranchement & ont emmenéz plus de 800 Beufs, & quelques chevaux de l'Ar∣mée, & partrois ou deux faits Prisonniers on est averti, que le secour sera icy dans cin∣que a six jours fort de 90000 Hommes, a∣vec 80 pieces de Canon, cecy cependant ne se conforme point, avec les nouvellos du General Veterani; De quelle facon que cela soit, si le secours vient je ne vois pas que nous ayons assez d'Infanterie pour sou∣tenir les Approches, Garner los Lignes pour mettre au de la du Danube, & empe∣cher
le secour, & pour Garder les ponts, & proviande, qui serà sans doute coupée par les Tartares, qui passeront là Sauve ou a la nage ou à Sabagg de sorte que, non obstant que sur le commencement nous ay∣ons eu assez de temps, & moyens, pour emporter cette place, Je vois tres neces∣saire d'en abandonner le Siege, & repasser au plus vite la Sauve, si l'on veut conser∣ver l'Armée, le Royaume d'Hongrie, & toutes ses Conquêtes, &c. Continuation du Journal de Siege de Belgrade, depuis le 5 jusqu'au 9 Septembre, 1693. LE 5 le feu de nos Batteries fut fort grand, & nous jettemes quantité de Bombes & de Carcasses sur l'ouvrage à Corne. Nous commencâmes aussi a faire une grande Ligne parallele a notre droite. Le General Archinto fut dangereusement blesse d'un coup de Mousquet, & pendanr tout le travail nous n'eûmes qu'un Soldat de blessé & pas un de tué. Sur le soir un transfuge de la ville, qui étoit Chrêtien & qui avoit travaillé aux Mines des Ennemis rapporta qu'il n'y en avoit encore pas une de remplie. Il s'of∣frit a nous decouvrir toutes celles qui avoi∣ent été faites contre notre Attaque ce qu'il fit le lendemain, & on a trouvé que cela étoit conforme aux avis que quelques uns de nos Ingenieurs, qui avoient fortifié au∣trefois Belgrade, avoienr donné & a ceux qu'on a eu depuis. Le 6 il arriva 2 Expres que le General Veterani renvoya de Transylvanie avec nouvelle certain que le Grand Visir avoit passé le Danube avec les Tures, & que par∣my les Tartares il regnoit une Maladie contagieuse qui en faisoit mourir plusi∣eurs. Le méme jour on fit la Parallele gauche & on l'avanca beaucoup, & en plusieurs en∣droits on sappa. Nous commencames aussi a fermer le Danube avec des bateaux de Moulins a la Turque & une maniere des chaisnes Flottantes, au dessous de la Ville, entre deux Forts que nous avons aux deux bords de la jiviere depuis nos Lignes de Circonvallation. Le 7, a 4 heures du Matin le General Archinto mourut de sa blessûre & a 7 heures on fit assembler les Generaux de l'Infante∣rie & on tint conseil pour scavoir de quelle maniere on attaqueroit la Contrescarpe & on resolut pour mieux tromper l'Ennemy d'attaquer le poligone par plusieurs en∣droits a la fois, & a chaque endroit premi∣erement avec 100 Grenadiers ensemble, en∣suite avec 300, qui devoient poursuivre ceux des Ennemis qu'ils trouveroient. Ceux ci devoient étre suivis de 300 autres qui avoient ordre de prendre poste sur les Palissades. Les Grenadiers devoient étre sontenus de 600 Fuseliers, & tous ensemble devoient étre couverts de 1200 Mousquetaires des dernieres Lignes. On destina 1700 hom∣mes pour toutes sortes de travaux & 6 Ba∣taillons de reserve. Excepté ce qui étoit de reserve il n'y eut que 4100 hommes pour l'Attaque, dont 2 tiers des Imperiaux & un tiers des Brandebourgeois & Lunebour∣geois devoient donner à la droite. Le General Guido Stahremberg eut l'Attaque droite, & le General Bavarien Monsieur Seybelsdorf la gauche. Les Auxiliaires avoient leur poste au milieu, chacun devoit commander les siens & avoir son Corps de reserve particulier en cas de besoin. L'Attaque devoit commencer une de∣mi-heure avant la nuit, afin que pendant la nuit on pust se fortifier & avoir toutes les Communications necessaires. A midi on amena tout le monde dont on avoit besoin & a 2 heures apres Midi S. A. le Duc de Croy & le General Heusler vinrent eux mémes donner les ordres sur la place ainsi on fit en toute diligence ap∣porter des Fascines, des Gabions & autres choses necessaires; mais avant qu'on fust prest non seulement le tems destiné pour l'atraque se passa, mais on traisna jusqu'a 10 heures du soir lorsque la lune se cou∣choit de sorte qu'on croioit de renvoyer au lendemain, mais l'ardeur des Soldats & des Officiers etoit si grande & la contenance de l'Ennemi qui se tenoit pres de ses feux donna si bonne esperance qu'on voulut faire une tentative.
Les Grenadiers qui coururent d'abord, firent fort bien, & sauterent en plusieurs endroits dans la Contrescarpe, les autres commencerent a prendre poste: Nos Ca∣nons & nos Bombes les seconderent a mer∣veille, & c'etoit un beau feu a voir; mais les Ennemis qui etoient assembléz dans la Contrescarpe & dans les ouvrages de de∣hors en ayant eu le vent sans qu'on s'en doutast, illuminerent tout par le moyen de leurs feux d'Artifice. Ils firent une opiniatre resistance & atti¦rerent a eux avec des Crochets nos Fascines & Gabions, & en jettant continuellement des Sacs de Poudre, des pierres & des Grenades ils empecherent que nous ne gardassions poste si prés de la Contre∣scarpe. Outre que pendant l'obscurité ceux qui étoient a l'Attaque gauche s'avancerent si fort de là droite & y pousserent tellement ceux du milieu, que chacun n'etant pas dans sa veritable place, & ce poste etant si eloigné de nos Lignes qu'on ne pouvoit s'y maintenir de nuit, encore moins de jour, on trouva bon de faire reculer nôtre Mon∣de & de le faire avancer peu a peu jusqu'a l'endroit on nous sommes presentement. Ce qui se fit aprés un rude choc qui dura pendant 2 heures, & nous nous sommes logés a 24 pas par le Moyen d'une nouvel∣le Ligne. Nous avons eu 6 ou 700 Hom∣mes de tuéz & blessez. Le General des Bavarois Monsieur Sey∣bersdorf a été tué dans cette occasion, com∣me aussi le Lieutenant Colonel Horn, le jeune Comte Beck: Parmi les blessez se trouverent le Colonel Marsigli, le Colonel Blankensee, le Comte de Thaun Lieute∣nant Golonel de Guido Stahremberg, les Ba∣rons d'Alman & d'Andremont Capitaines. Les Ennemis doivent avoir aussi beaucoup perdu de Monde. Le 8 on a beaucoup avancée la nouvelle Ligne, & on a achevé un grand travail sans faire aucune perte, en sorte que dans 3 jours on espere d'étre pres de la Contre∣scarpe. On a detaché des Partys pour al∣ler reconnoitre l'Ennemi qu'on croit d'etre bientot icy aux environs. Le 9 un Party de Tartares vint jusques vers nôtre Camp. Il a emmené quantité de bestail, qu'on faisoit paitre malgré la deffense au de la des Sentinelles. On les a poursuivi & on a fait 2 Prisonniers qui di∣sent que le Grand Visir est vers la Morava avec son Armée & qu'il doit incessamment s'avancer vers Semendria. The Grand Vizier having entered the Town on the 15th,Septemb. the Christians re∣tired from before it, the Vizier caused all the Works which the Germans had made, to be filled, and levelled; and what da∣mage the Cannon and Bombs had made, to be repaired; and sent fresh Provisions for Temeswaer under a strong Convoy; and having caused the Tartars to make some Excursion near Peter Waradin, and taken a view of the Imperial Camp, the Vizier attempted nothing more of moment. Nor did the Imperial Army undertake any thing farther, than to Retrench it self near to Pe∣ter Waradin, and act on the Defensive, which was all that had been done of mo∣ment, during the remainder of this whole Campaign, unless in these two Particulars following. On the 17th of September, Count Ba∣theim Ban of Croatia, Dalmatia, and Scla∣vonia, marched from the River Unna, and Costannizza, with the Land Militia, and arrived on the 19th at three a Clock in the Afternoon, before the Turkish City call'd Brunzein Maidan; where having taken a Survey of the Ground, the following Night the Trenches were opened: And On the 20th, they began to fire their great Guns,Brunzien taken by Storm. and to throw Bombs into the City: The Garrison, and the Inhabitants defended themselves bravely; for tho' they were twice Summoned, they refused to Surrender, saying, That the Place was a Magazine belonging to the Sultan, which therefore they were obliged to maintain to the last Drop of their Blood: The Place was also of greater importance, by reason of the Iron and Copper Mines, which arose in the Neighbourhood, our of which they forged Mortar-pieces, and great Quantities of Iron Bullets. The Besieged defended themselves very valiantly for the space of two Hours; but at last the Pallisadoes being pulled up, or cut down, the Walls of the City were for∣ced, and taken, and above 500 Men and Women were put to the Sword, amongst which there were two Chief Commanders, and a third, Chachilovich by Name, was ta∣ken Prisoner, together with many princi∣pal Persons more of both Sexes. Within the Town the Besiegers found great quantities of Bombs, of which some were of 200 weight, with store of Brass of rare and cunning Workmanship, toge∣ther with other very rich Booty; of all which having Plundered the Inhabitants,
and carried away all that was worth the taking, they burned the City and Suburbs to Ashes,Plunder'd and Burnt. with the Houses that were in the Neighbourhood, with the loss only of a∣bout 40 Men. The other Successful Enterprize was executed on the 19th of October by Gene∣ral Hoffkirken, against Giula, of which the General himself gave this Narrative in a Letter to the Duke of Croy, sent him by an Express in this manner. General Hoffkirken's Letter to the Duke of Croy. THIS Morning I-fell upon the Turks and Tartars very early, when they least expected me, and having at the first onset forced them to retreat beyond the first Palanca, I caused the Dragoons, with 500 Horsemen to alight from their Horses, and with their Swords in their Hands to pass the Ditch: The Enterprize was bold, but vigorously executed. The Turks were very strong, their Force consisting of 40 Troops of Horse, 1200 Janisaries, with 2800 Tartars newly arrived to Convoy Provision into that Fortress; but being on the other side of it, they were so hotly attacked, that they were driven to the Castle, and upwards of 1000 of them were killed, and 2500 Horses and Camels taken from them. All the Provisions which should have been brought into Giula were yet lying in their Mosques within the Palancha, together with some thousands of Measures of Corn which came laden on Camels, were burn'd in the sight of the Turks, and thereby all their cost and labours lost, which were designed to supply that Place with Provisions. Had I come but eight Hours sooner, I had also met with the Tartars marching to Debre∣zin; howsoever I am now preparing to fol∣low them, and hope to ome up with them to morrow, or the day following. The Tartars returning homewards to Budziack, and passing through Walachia, they entirely ruin'd and destroyed the Country. But before we end this Year, and the Accidents which happened there∣in, we are to take notice of another terri∣ble fire at Constantinople: For as there hap∣pened one before in the Month of May last past, so now another broke out on the 26th of August, more grievous and terri∣ble than any had done for many years be∣fore. The former Fire in May began at Balata, as we have related; but that in the Month of August broke out at Odun Schelesi, or the Wood-wharf,August▪ being the common place where all the Timber for building Houses and Ships is laid, and in which are many hundreds of Chambers of vast bigness for receiving all sorts and sizes of squar'd Timber, with millions of Boards, and other Timber fitted for build∣ing; the Damage of which amounted to an incredible sum; and was of such a ge∣neral terror and consternation, that had it happened at the time when Belgrade was last besieged, the People for very affright∣ment would have fled from Philopopolis and Adrianople; and at Constantinople it self the People were possessed with such a Panick Fear, that thousands of Families were rea∣dy to abandon the City, and to fly into Asia,Constan∣tinople burn'd a second time this Year. for a quarter part of the City was burn'd down; and to encrease this terror amongst the People, it was given out, that the Germans were coming upon them with a very numerous Army. And it is here very observable, that about that time things being in a doubtful condition, and no news coming from the Army, nor from Belgrade, the Grand Seignior in a most furious rage swore, that if that City were lost, he would take off the Heads of the Grand Vizier, and of Osman Pasha, the Chimacam, who affrighted with this Me∣nace, fell sick, and died with fear. The Eunuchs also in the Seraglio took the con∣fidence from hence to speak against the Go∣vernment, exclaiming openly, that if such Miscarriages were permitted in, and a∣mongst the Principal Officers, the Sultan would be forced to quit Europe, and take refuge in Anatolia. But when the news came that the Siege of Belgrade was raised, the Anger of the Sultan began to abate, and to be appeased against the Chief Officers; and then the language of the People changed its tone, and praised the Officers, who but a few days before they had cursed and condemn∣ed to utter Ruine, saying▪ that the raising of this Siege was a Miracle of God, who had heard their Prayers; which brought a vast Confluence of People to their Mosches, to give Thanks to God, and to make Corban, as they call it,Corban made at Constan∣tinople and Adri∣anople. which is a kind of Sacrifice, offered in this manner; they who are of the richer sort, kill Sheep and Lambs, and having prepared them, they cut them in pieces, and give them to the Poor, which is a great Charity and Relief to them; and
this in such cases of Joy, and Thanksgi∣ving, is the most Solemn Act in all their Religion. The Turks before this Action were grie∣vously dejected and cast down, but were again revived by the news that the Siege of Belgrade was raised. To these Misfor∣tunes and Miseries the raging Pestilence of this Year contributed very much, of which thousands of People died in all parts of the Ottoman Dominions; and thus the Turks had three Judgments of God upon them this last Year, namely Fire, Sword, and Pestilence. And this is all that passed this Year of any moment; for the Venetiansf had neither done, nor attempted any thing; and the Turks having lost nothing, took courage against the next Year to be early in the field, with a far greater Army than they had this, and likewise at Sea with a stron∣ger, and a more numerous Fleet, having 20 Sail of Stout Men of War in the Ar∣chipelago already fitted, from 50 to 80 Guns, besides the increase of their Gali∣ots, and Brigantines on the Danube. These and such like matters encouraging the Turks, with the Expectation of a Peace with Poland, which the French Ambassador fo∣mented, and forwarded so far, that an Am∣bassador being sent from Varsovia to Adria∣nople to treat, the same backed with the French Interest; it was generally believed that the Peace was concluded; but how true that was, the Successes of the next Year will demonstrate unto us. Anno 1694. THIS following Year of 1694. pro∣duced no greater Actions than the former, but yet continued still to be suc∣cessful to the Emperor. In the beginning of March the Grand Vizier was dispossessed of his High Office, and succeeded by Ali, Pasha of Tripoli; the cause whereof was on a slight occasion, which was this; the Vizier being desirous to take some recre∣ation with hunting Hares on a certain day, his Enemies took the opportunity to bring the Sultan that way, where he unluckily met with the Vizier's Dogs, and a noise of hunting; of which the Grand Seignior enquiring what it meant, some Enemies to the Vizier answered, that it was the Grand Vizier, who might have employed his time in management of the Affairs of the Empire, better than in Sports and Re∣creations, reserved, and more becoming the pleasures of his Master, than his own; but this (as they added) was no wonder, it be∣ing his constant trade and practice. With which the Sultan became so enraged, that he immediately sent for him,The Grand V r ∣po . and taking the Seals from him, he deprived him of his Office. Hereupon Ali Pasha was sent for,All Pasha Vizier. being esteemed a Man of great Courage, and Experience in all State Affairs, and being Arrived at Adrianople in the beginning of May, he immediately put forth the Horse-Tail, which is a Signal that the Vizier designs his march for the Camp in 40 days afterwards; and to shew his readiness, and zeal for the Grand Seigni∣or's Service, he raised and equipped 3000 Men at his own Charge, and out of his own Estate. But here we may observe, that before the former Vizier was depos'd, Orders had been given, that henceforward no Venetian Ships should be permitted to come into any of the Ottoman Ports un∣der English or French Colours, upon con∣fiscation of Ship and Lading; howsoever two Months were allowed for execution of the Penalty, on those Ships which were already arrived within the Ports. As the Grand Vizier was depos'd for the reasons aforesaid,Chimacam Ahmet Pasha ba∣nished. so also was the Chi∣macam, called Calailicos Ahmet Pasha, of Greek Extraction▪ in danger of being strangled, had not the Queen Mother, and the Kuzlir Aga, or Chief Eunuch procu∣red the favour to have his Punishment al∣tered, and changed to an Exile into Egypt, for the many Tyrannies and Cruelties he had committed; and particularly for that he had taken away the Ancient Church called St. George at Constantinople, belonging to the Patriarchate for some hundreds of Years before that time: In his place Jeien Pasha, a prudent Person, and one very well practised in Affairs, was constituted Chi∣macam; and being the Nephew of the fa∣mous Kupriogli, gave general satisfaction to all People, and particularly to the Greeks and Christians, to whom he al∣ways shewed much favour. At this time, as is usual, there were two great Factions at Adrianople, one in the Seraglio, consisting of the Queen Regent, the Kuzlir-Aga, and other Principal Cour∣tiers; the other Party in opposition to these, were the Mufti, the Grand Vizier, and Principal Officers of the Janizaries, and Spahees: To strengthen these, after the Death of Osman Pasha, the Selictar-Aga was chosen Chimacam, being a Young Man, a Chircassian by Nation, of a very good understanding, and for his years very well versed in Affairs: This Person being promoted to this Office without the know∣ledge or consent either of the Grand Vi∣zier,
or the Mufti, but only by the Ma∣chination or Contrivance of the Kuzlir-Aga and Queen Mother, rendred his Con∣dition the more unsetled, and uncertain. And indeed not only the Court, but all the Empire was in great Confusion by rea∣son of the weakness of three or four Sultans successively, of whom we have al∣ready given a Character, and particularly of this Sultan Achmet, of whom the best we can say is, that he was a Good Natur'd Jolly Prince, and feared no hurt, nor wish∣ed it to any Person whatsoever. But how the state of Affairs were in those days, we may learn from a Letter, which my Lord Paget wrote to a Person of Quality at Vienna, dated April 24. N. S. 1694. Lord Paget's Letter. SIR, THEY so often change their Ministers here, that an Ambassador can scarce come to treat twice with the same Person. Since my arrival here at the Port, they have had three Grand Viziers, three Chima∣cams of Adrianople, four Chimacams, of Constantinople, three Aga's of the Janisa∣ries, three Tefterdars or Lord Treasurers, two New Cadileschers or Judges of Asia, and Romelia; and in short, all the Great Officers of the Empire were changed, (the Mufti only excepted) by which there was such a New Set of Idiots and Fools got into Places, as would overturn the best settled Government in the World. For these Officers being only such, as Chance offers, it is a doubtful Wager, whether he proves a Fool, or a Wise Man; and in case he should prove a Man of Parts, yet he is suffered so short a time to remain in his Office, that he is in no capacity to improve them. Ambassadors, unless it be at their first Au∣dience, and at that of Congedie, have no Con∣versation or Access to the Grand Seigniors, and then they affect such a sort of Grandeur, as may best cover all their Thoughts by a Si∣lence, so that they give no place for any de∣bate; and a Man can never lay any foundati∣on upon their Words: For as their Ally of France scorns to be a Slave to his word; so they hold it to be no dishonour to be open, and esteem nothing for a Secret. It is true, that very seldom or never, a Minister shall re∣ceive a flat denial from a Turk, for he shall train you on to the very last point; and when you come to the last Argument, and Upshot of all, then a Sum of Money must make the Conclusion. The disorders made by the Arabian Princes in the Countries about Aleppo did still continue, which caused great fears, and apprehensions at Constantinople it self: but those Countries being far remote, and distant made little alterations or noise at Court. The Negotiations of Poland at Adria∣nople had no success,April. so that the Envoy was dispatched away, re infectâ. Some few days afterwards, the Tartar Han quitted the Court with dissatisfaction, and all things seemed in much disorder; however they talked high of great preparations for the following Campagne: And to make some evidences thereof, they dispatched away 1200 Janisaries from Adrianople to Belgrade; moreover they sent away 32 Saiques for the Danube. About this time the Grand Vizier arri∣ved from Tripoli de Soria, where he had been Pasha, and was sent for by the Grand Seignior to head the Army in Hungary, having been recommended by some Fa∣vourites to have been the wisest and most experienced General in the Empire, but the trial shewed him to be a Man rather of the Pen and good Language, than of Arms. But to speak more fully and pertinently concerning the Negotiations of the Polish Envoy at Adrianople, he was lodged at Demer∣desh, about an English Mile from the City, in a poor Village, without Ceremony, or any great Equipage; he had a Coach with six Horses, in which was a French Jesuit: His Business was declared rather to be de∣signed to the Tartar Han, who was at that time at Adrianople, than to the Grand Seig∣nior, and accordingly had Audience of him. In the first place it was observable,Polish En∣voy's Audi∣ence with the Tartar Han at A∣driano∣ple. that during the time of his Audience with the Tartar Han, the Polish Envoy kept his Cap off, until he was bid to sit down and be covered; after a few words of Complement, he arose up and delivered his Letter. The Han asked him, whether he had any other Letters for him; to which he replied no. He asked him from whom that Letter was, he answered, from the King his Master. The Han asked him, whether he had any thing to say to him by word of Mouth, to which he answered no, for that all was contained within the Letter. The Han spake in the Tartar Language, and the Pole in his own. The Audience ended,
the Pole arose, kissed the Han's Vest, re∣tired backwards with his Face towards the Han, which is a part of respect amongst Turks and Tartars, and most of the Eastern People, all which was over in less than half an Hours time. The which Passage seemed very Myste∣rious, and not well understood, from whence, and from whom this Envoy was sent; but being gone out of the Presence of the Han, the Negotiation appeared to concern War and Peace, and a Treaty pro∣posed to be held in order thereunto, be∣tween the Turk and Tartar on one side, and of the Emperor, King of Poland, and the Venetian State on the other. Hereof intel∣ligence was given by my Lord Paget, Monsieur Heemskirk, and Heer Colyer, to the Emperor, Venetians, and all the Allies whom it might concern; the which seemed very strange, that such a Negotiation should be set on foot unknown to them, or to the Mediators of the Peace; the which was still more surprizing, when the Orders for such a Treaty given to a Polish Mini∣ster, were disavowed, and unexpected by the Emperor and the Venetians; and what made the Business the more doubtful, was, That this Envoy brought no Letters for the Mediators,A sham Envoy from Poland. from any of the Allies, or Prin∣ces concerned; nor did he admit of any Sa∣lutes from the Foreign Christian Ministers; for tho' my Lord Paget had his Secretary Mr. Coke, and the Ambassador Colyer had his Chief Interpreter upon the Place, yet the Pole would admit of none of their Ad∣dresses, or Visits, but adhered close to the French Ambassadors, with whom he had long and frequent Conferences. This unusual way of management of Treaties, gave just reason of suspicion to all Persons, that this Negotiation was no∣thing but an Artifice of the French, to bring Poland into a separate Peace with the Turk, which perhaps by the Cunning and Crafty Insinuations of the French might have suc∣ceeded, had not the Pole too earnestly in∣sisted on the Surrender of Caminieck into their Hands, with all the Provisions, Arms, and Fortresses, and with the Uti Possidetis; which was a Term at that time, and du∣ring the late Treaty, mortally hateful to the Turks: Had not that Term, I say, been unluckily started, it is very probable, that the Turks would have accepted of a separate Peace with the Poles: And more∣over this particular Article would go down the worse, in regard that the Turks had lately repaired that strong Fortress, and supplied it with all sorts of Provisions, and of all Parts had made it almost impregna∣ble: And another Difficulty was, That Poland was not willing to Surrender some small Places which they had taken on the Frontiers of Moldavia;The Turks averse to a Peace, with the Sur∣render of Caminiec by which it plain∣ly appears, That all this Treaty was no∣thing but an Artifice of the French, to a∣muse the Turks, and try if possible, by some Overtures of this Nature, to bring the Poles into a separate Peace. The Cham of Tartary being a Chief Actor, and designed to bear a principal part in this disguised Treaty, finding that hereby he began by his Friendship with the Polish Envoy, to lose his Credit, and Reputation, and that his good Friend the Grand Vizier, (tho' newly put into Place) was tottering, and near being Deposed, and to be himself commanded to return into his own Country, he hastned away this supposititious Envoy all he could, and ac∣cordingly, by Order of the Grand Seigni∣or, he was dispatched away with some In∣dignity, and Disgrace; neither the Tartar Cham, nor the Grand Vizier daring to o∣pen their Mouths in his Behalf, or to men∣tion any of the Conditions he had propo∣sed for a Peace: And such a Person must have been endued with a good Stock of Confidence,The Polish Envoy sent away with Disgrace. and Impudence to manage a Business of the highest Importance on such weak Grounds as he had to pretend, espe∣cially at a time when all the Grand Offi∣cers of the Empire were upon their Change. But such as speak most favourably of this Business say, That this Polish Envoy, or Agent, was not sent to make a separate Peace, but to prepare things in order there∣unto, by advancing their Conditions, on which the Port might afterwards treat with the Emperor and the Venetians, send∣ing their Ministers into Transylvania with Powers to that purpose; but all this came to nothing as will appear by the sequel of this History. In the mean time all things were in great disorder in the Court between those Offi∣cers who live within and without the Se∣raglio, to make up these Differences. The Grand Vizier, with the Tartar Han, Tef∣terdar, Pasha, and Janisar Aga, and some o∣thers held a Council in the Month of Fe∣bruary, where it was resolved, To move the Grand Seignior, to remove the Kuzlir-Aga, and the Haznadar-Aga; and to that end the Vizier made Talkish to the Grand Seignior, and the other Arz, for removal of those Persons, who were Mutinous, and Intriguing in Matters of State. Upon this Complaint the Grand Seignior grew very angry, and told the Vizier, That the Kuzlir-Aga deserved indeed to be pu∣nished, for recommending him, the Vizier, to that high Office; adding, That he was neither a Fool, nor a Child, to be governed by other Mens Humours; and that the
Report was false, That the Kuzlir-Aga medled in Affairs of State. The Grand Seignior showing in this manner some Displeasure against the Vi∣zier, who had now but little Support be∣sides the Tartar Cham; it was insinuated to the Sultan, That it was improper for two Princes to live in the same City; and that it had never been the Practice of for∣mer times, for the Cham to reside at the Port, there to pry into the Secrets of the Empire. Hereof the Cham having had some In∣timation, and seeing the Disorders arising in the Court, and fearing to be sent away, he desired to be dismist, pretending that his Presence was necessary in his own Coun∣try, he took leave of the Sultan at a So∣lemn Audience; and being richly present∣ed, he began his Journey homewards, be∣ing accompanied out of Adrianople by the Grand Vizier. After the Departure of the Cham, the Grand Vizier's Wife, who was Sister to the Grand Seignior, was forbidden the Court, which was an evident demonstrati∣on that her Husband was not likely to con∣tinue long in that Office. The Heer Heemskirk, who had been sent to the Assistance of Monsieur Colyer, Ambassador for the States-General at Con∣stantinople, for management of the Peace between the Emperor and the Turks; or rather for want of an English Ambassador, the two former, Sir William Hussey, and Mr. Herbert being both Dead. At that time the Turks seeming inclinable to a Peace, King William thought it not fit to let pass this Opportunity for want of an Ambassa∣dor from England; but rather qualified Monsieur Heemskirk then at Vienna, with the Title of English Ambassador to the Grand Seignior (of which we have for∣merly made some mention) the which had currantly passed with the Turks, had not the French discovered the matter, and de∣clared that this Heemskirk was no English Man, nor no Minister of the King of En∣land, but a German; and one under Noti∣on of an Ambassador, sent for a Spy to de∣ceive the Turks. Mr. Heem∣skirk sent back.Upon which Insinuation, Heemskirk was not able afterwards to treat with the Turks, nor would they accept of any Propositions from him, or acknowledge him for a pub∣lick Minister, but committed him to Cu∣stody, and kept him under a strict Guard; and so was detained for some Months, un∣til the Lord Paget was sent to supply the Office of a true and undoubted Ambassa∣dor; at which time Heer Heemskirk was called to Audience, and had his Dismis∣sion. Upon Departure Heemskirk said, He was sorry that his Endeavours for putting an end to this Bloody War, had been unsuccessful. To which the Vizier answered, That Peace would be, when God pleased, and was not at the Pleasure and Will of Man: And so with∣out saying any thing more material, Heem∣skirk was dismissed: and began his Jour∣ney from Adrianople towards Belgrade on the 2d of March. During these Matters, great were the Disorders at Court; the Grand Vizier grew weary of his Office, and would glad∣ly have been rid of it, could he have done it with safety, and Name his Successor; and in the mean time his Wife endeavour∣ed to accommodate Matters between her Husband, and the Kuzlir-Aga: Notwith∣standing which Differences, and the great Animosities, yet they slackned nothing of their Diligences to be early this Year in the Field, and accordingly Commands were is∣sued out to dispose all things thereunto: And an Aga was sent to Walachia for 500 Horses to carry Flour to Belgrade. The French Ambassador perswaded the Turks to open their Campaign this Year, by way of Transylvania; and to induce them to follow his Advice, he assured them that his King would have an Army this Year in Germany of 100000 Men, but the Turks never gave much Credence to the Boastings of the French, whom they com∣monly styled with the Name of Yalangi Francos: And to second this Opinion of the French, the Nogay Tartars,The No∣gay Tar∣tar. who were setled in a Part of Moldavia, made an In∣cursion through that Province into Transyl∣vania, and took from thence about 6000 Captives, and a considerable Booty. These Nogay Tartars were called into those Countries by the Tartar Han, to suc∣cour and assist him at the time, when the Moscovites came against Crim, and were then placed with their Families in good Numbers about Budziac, and part of Mol∣davia; the Prince of which made Com∣plaint to the Grand Seignior, that being deprived of a great part of his Country by his new come Guests; the Provinces were entirely ruined, and the People no longer able to support the Charge, and pay their Tribute: But this Complaint having but little Effect, the whole Blame of these Miscarriages were attributed to the ill Con∣duct of the Grand Vizier; for which cause he was Deposed, and the Embrahor,The Grand Vizier de∣posed. or Master of the Horse, was sent to demand, and receive the Seals from him, and the Chimacam of Adrianople employed to Seal up his House.
Hereupon the Deposed Vizier obtained by the assistance of Friends, a Hatteshe∣risse, or Royal Command from the Grand Seignior, to return towards his Govern∣ment of Tripoli de Soria, without molesta∣tion; for which he gave the Messenger that brought it five Purses of Money. Notwithstanding which, a Capigi, with several Bostangees, were dispatched after him to bring him back, and having over∣taken him, he was committed Prisoner be∣tween the Ports, from whence very few escape with their Lives; nor did he long survive, his Estate being all seized, and confiscated to the Use of the Sultan. Another Capigi-Basha was likewise sent to fetch the Head of Ali Pasha, who was Great Vizier before this last Deposed Vi∣zier. Likewise about the same time, the Kahya of Osman Pasha, the lately deceased Chimacam of Adrianople, was put under Arrest, and his Master's Money, Jewels, and Goods, with his own, were demand∣ed to bring Money into the Seraglio. But before we proceed any farther, it may not be from our Purpose to declare an Action which happened in the Port of Smyrna, in the Month of March, as fol∣lows.March. One Capt. Hely Commander of a Mer∣chant's Ship of 30 Guns, having brought some Goods to Smyrna from Legorne, and finding no Goods that presented for a Voy∣age back again, he resolved to seek his For∣tune in some other Port: The same Morn∣ing Captain Marine, a French Merchant-Man, and Captain Teissere another French Man weighed also, and accompanied the English Ship half way to the Castle, where they remained a Back-stays for several Hours; and seeing Captain Hely turning out, watched an Opportunity to bear down upon him; which Hely endeavour∣ing to avoid all that was possible, could not yet hinder the French Man from falling foul of him, by which he broke his Sprit-sail Yard, and Jack-staff; and presented many Musquets, and Pistols at the Men to provoke them to Fight, or commit some rash Action, to the Breach of the Peace in the Grand Seignior's Port; but Captain Hely managed his Business with such Mo∣deration, and Courage, that he saved the King's Jack, and took it in, and then hoi∣sted it again; and the French cutting some of their own Mizen-Shrouds, Hely got clear, and Sailed away towards the Castle, with a good part of the French Man's Co∣lours, being foul of a Block. That Night Hely having procured Ma∣terials to repair his Damage, sailed away, and the next Day got within five Miles of Marine, Rowing to come up to him, which he did near Cape Caraborno, and there en∣gaged him, and after four Hours Fight, in which Hely fired above 200 of his Cannon, he took the French Ship, which was said to be worth more than a 100000 Lyon Dol∣lars. There being two Viziers lately Depo∣sed, it was commanded,The New Vizier. That the New Vizier should be actually at Adrianople on the 15th of April, so as that he might be with the Army in the Field before the Month of June. This New Vizier was called Ali Pasha, as was also his Predecessor, and both had been Pasha's at Tripoli of Soria, and came from thence; but as to this, he had no great Reputation for his Qualities: He had five Years ago been Tefterdar, or Lord Treasurer, at the Port; he had been a great Favourite, and an old Friend of the late Kuzlir-Aga; but others who knew him well, had no great Opinion of him, but looked upon him, as a Man of little Experience, without Parts, or Abilities for so great a Charge,Character of the New Vizier. and esteemed for a Per∣son not likely to continue long in that Su∣blime Station. Whilst Matters were preparing for the Camp, against the Arrival of the New Vi∣zier. Ahmet Pasha who had been Chima∣cam of Constantinople, was declared Pasha of Arzrum in Armenia Major, and was actual∣ly Listing Soldiers in Nicomedia; at which every one wondered, and commonly re∣ported, That he having been disobliged by the Court, was there Raising and Listing Soldiers to joyn with the Rebels in Asia; of which some Murmurings coming to the Ears of the Kuzlir-Aga his Friend, he ad∣vised him to hasten away with all diligence possible, for that his loytering in those Parts, gave just Jealousie and Ground to the contrary Faction, to report Evil and Dangerous Matters concerning him; and for that reason he urged him to be gone on the Business for which he was employ∣ed; promising, That in case he dealt Faithfully and Wisely in this Business, he would at his Return use his best Endeavors to make him Grand Vizier. The least Whisperings of this Nature in the Time of another Sultan, had been sufficient to have taken the Heads both of the Pasha, and of his Friend the Kuzlir-Aga, but this pre∣sent Grand Seignior feared no Evil, nor de∣signed it unto others; so that Ahmet Pasha lived boldly, and without controul in Ni∣comedia, being Proud, Obstinate, and Ca∣pricious, carrying no respect to the Com∣mands and Orders of the Port; but gave out his own Commands to several Places, to raise some Thousands of Segmen, which are a sort of Foot Soldiers; which he acted
so openly, that the World could not but take notice thereof, and declare him a Re∣bel: Upon which, fearing some worse Pro∣ceedings, he quitted Nicomedia, and mar∣ched towards his Brethren in Asia, to take part with them in their Rebellious De∣signs. In the mean time News came that the Grand Vizier was speedily expected at Adrianople, and that he was already arri∣ved at Chalcedon, which was a Place ancient∣ly famous for one of the four General Councils, and opposite to Constantinople; from whence on the 18th of April he pas∣sed the Channel into Europe, and taking the ready Road leading to Adrianople, he entered that City on the 21st of that Month, where he was received with all i∣maginable Kindness by the Faction then predominant in the Seraglio. And the Vizier to demonstrate all Duty and Obedience to the Sultan, as also Affe∣ction to the People, and Militia, he issued forth the Horse-Tails on the second Day after his Arrival, which denotes the Inten∣tions of the Grand Vizier to begin his March in 40 Days from the time, or at farthest on the first of the following June. According to this Ancient Custom, the Vizier 20 Days before his Departure pit∣ched his Tents, and sent out the Horse-Tails into the Camp near Adrianople, with intent as was reported, to march towards Belgrade; but Transylvania was this Year chiefly in their Eye, as was advised by the French Ambassador; but it appearing, that great Preparations were making by the Imperialists, to fall upon Belgrade, the Turks altered their Design, and took their way towards that Place, to Fortifie, and Strengthen it with what Forces they were able. Upon the Arrival of the Grand Vizier at Belgrade, many sad Complaints and La∣mentations were brought him from Te∣meswaer, and Giula, complaining of their streightned Condition for want of Provisi∣ons; upon which it was resolved to sup∣ply them with Rice and Corn of all sorts; and the Chimacam of Adrianople, in the absence of the Vizier, sent them several Horse Ladings of Provisions, and Money to the value of 40000 Dollars, or 80 Pur∣ses, under the Convoy of 800 Janisa∣ries. Whilst the Grand Vizier was acting in Hungary, Advices came from all Hands in Asia, and was reported as well from Euro∣peans, as from Asiaticks, that the Sheriffs Army increased daily, and had Plundered a very rich City, in which were great Quantities of Rich Goods of all sorts, and that this Army lived under exact Disci∣pline; the which Army (as was reported) was divided into two Parts, one Division remained with the Sheriff, and lay En∣camped between Mecca and Medina; and another part of this Army was encamped in the Province, or Kingdom of Bassora, where they made Head against those Pa∣sha's which were Constituted by the Sul∣tan, endeavouring to obstruct all those Ways leading to Aleppo. The News hereof did not a little trouble the Mind of the Grand Seignior, and served to increase his Disease of the Dropsie, which had been very fatal to the Ottoman Family; howso∣ever a certain famous Physician gave hopes of his Recovery, pretending to Cure him,Sultan Achmet in danger of Death. by opening four Issues in his Legs and Feet; but an acute Fever coming there∣upon, People began to despair of his Life, which caused a great Silence in all Parts, particularly in the Army in Hungary, where it was reported, That the Sultan was Dead, or out of all hopes of Recove∣ry; besides which, all things went ill for the Turks, for the three Pasha's which were dispatched from Sofia to receive Taxes from the Venetians, not far from Narenta, returned back without Contributions to∣wards the War; which so grievously trou∣bled the Grand Vizier, that he dispatched away three other Beyes with a good De∣tachment of the Albanian Militia, to force and collect his Taxes. And tho' the Turks put a good Face on their Misfortunes; yet the Villanous Rebels, and Tumultuous Robbers in Asia continued their Outrages, so that nothing came from thence, but Complaints and Unhappy Tydings: All the force that they could make, or expect from thence, was no more than the Yearly Succours for guard of the Castles upon the Hellespont, together with three Pasha's, and two Beys, making in all 3600 Men appointed for Recruits for the Grand Vi∣zier. To add farther to all these Misfortunes Advices were carried to all Places, That the Venetian Fleet was arrived before Myti∣lene with 30 Gallies, four Galleasses, 12 Ships of War, on which were Shipped 15000 Soldiers, the greatest part of which consisted of Albanians, Greeks, and Sclavo∣nians. Moreover farther intelligence came from Salonica, or Thessalonica, That they greatly feared the Venetian Fleet, which threatned to make a Descent within that Gulf, and were in some apprehensions least the Ene∣my should make an attempt on the Island of Scio.
About the middle of August the Turkish Forces began to arrive at several Quarters about Belgrade,August. where the 14th at Night, all was in Alarm by a Turkish Gally, which took Fire by the Negligence of the Men, and having much Powder and Ammunition aboard, blew up, to the terrible affright∣ment of the Turks in Belgrade, who appre∣hended, that the German Army was alrea∣dy under the Walls of the City; tho' at the same time they were no nearer than Peter Waradin, within the Retrenchment of last Year; where finding their Troops increase but slowly from other Quarters, they resolved there to remain Encamped, and act upon the Defensive. Septemb.On the 8th of September, the Day before the Vanguard of the Turkish Army appear∣ed in sight of that Retrenchment, a most Terrible Storm happened, which carried away the Tents of the Imperial Army, sunk several of their Ships,A Storm on the Da∣nube. broke their Bridge of Boats, and drove five Ships of the Fleet down to the Islands. All which they had much adoe to repair, and bring in order again before the whole Turkish Army came to assault them; for the Grand Vi∣zier having received a positive Order from the Sultan, to Attack and Fight the Impe∣rialists whereever they could meet with them, in compliance therewith Decamped on the seventh Instant from Salankement, and marched directly for Peter Waradin. And On the ninth, some of the Van-guard appeared in sight of that Place; the Grand Vizier with the Body of the Army then Encamping at Carlowitz, three Hours di∣stant from the Imperial Army. On the 10th, the whole Army came within half an Hour of the Imperial Re∣trenchment, the Foot taking their Quar∣ters next to our Front, and the Horse pla∣cing themselves to the left of their Foot, and on the left of these were Camped the Tartars. Their Fleet consisting in 110 Ships, came likewise within Cannon-shot of the Imperial Ships, and cast their Anchor there, being posted in a Line of Battle. The whole Day the Hussars were Skir∣mishing with the Turks and Tartars; and on the 11th it was thought the Turks would have Stormed the Imperial Camp; where∣fore all was prepared to receive them: They appeared with 3 or 400 Ensigns, or Companies, within 800 Paces of the Re∣trenchment, but behind the Earth of a Ditch which they had made, and which covered them so well, that the Imperial Guns could but little annoy them. A Fight by Water and Land.On the 12th the Turks begun to fire from all sides on the Imperial Camp, with their Great Guns: Their Fleet also advanced higher up, and fired furiously on the Im∣perial Ships, and on the Bridge,Septemb. but were answered as hotly both from the Imperial Ships, and from the Batteries on the Shore: Two Waggons with Ammunition were set on fire by a Shot of the Turks, and about 30 Men were thereby Killed or Burnt. Count Solms, Major of the Regiment of Cuirasses of Count Herbersteyn, was also Killed with a Cannon-Bullet. On the 13th, the firing both by Water and by Land, was again renewed: The Attack made by the Turks, seeming to be a formal Seige both of Peter Waradin, and of the Imperial Camp; they having either on their Ships, or Batteries, upwards of 500 Great Guns continually firing, tho' with little damage to the Germans: The Design of the Turks being to ruine the Im∣perial Bridge. This great Shooting continued at the same rate the 14th, 15th, 16th and 17th, which last Day the Turks not only threw Bombs out of three Mortar-Pieces into the Imperial Retrenchments, but also from the Point of the Island with two Mortars, in∣to Peter Waradin, and carried more Guns on their Batteries. But the Night betwixt the 17th and 18th, the Turks were pretty quiet, but after Break of Day they again fired more hotly than e∣ver, and shewed themselves beyond the Imperial Retrenchments; but being brisk∣ly Attacked by the Hussars, they were dro∣ven back to their Camp. The Turks also drew a new Parallel-Line 60 Paces nearer to the Imperial Camp, and were very bu∣sie to close the said Line with their Line of Communication. On the 19th in the Afternoon, the Ger∣man Right Wing fired with Great Guns and Musquets from an Eminence on the first Lines of the Turks, and annoyed them ve∣ry much, so that a great Alarm arose a∣mongst them, and the Turks came running from all sides with Horse and Foot, to strengthen and assist their Left Wing:The Bran∣denburg∣ers rin∣force the Grmans. That Evening the Brandenburgh Foot, consisting of six Battallions, arrived in the Camp, which were received with three Salvo's of the Guns from the Castle and the Batte∣ries on the Water-side: This Reinforce∣ment being arrived, the Turks seemed less brisk in their Attack; but that which most incommoded them, was, That the Gover∣nour of Titul surprized and took 25 Tur∣kish Ships laden with Provisions for their Army, and sunk two or three of their Fri∣gats. That the Tartars having at the Re∣quest of the Grand Vizier swam over the Donau near Cobila, (where indeed they had taken about 1000 Horse, and part of the Imperial Baggage) were overtaken in their
Retreat by General Bassompiere, who cut down above 1500 of the Tartars, amongst which was the Han's Son; and that there∣upon the Tartar Han fell out with the Grand Vizier and Commanded his Troops, consisting of 7000 Tartars which remained, to prepare for their return Home; not∣withstanding the Grand Vizier continued his Endeavours against the Imperial Re∣trenchments, and Peter Waradin, and the Bridge, till the 13th of October; but see∣ing that they lost more than they got at this sport,The Grand Vizier rai∣ses the Siege. and that also because the six or seven following Days of great Rains, the Turkish Soldiers were up to their Knees in the Water in their Approaches, which cau∣sed Numbers of 'em to Die, having also been several Days without Bread, by the taking of the abovesaid Ships; and not knowing when any would arrive, the Grand Vizier on the 13th at Night, cau∣sed all the Guns from the Forts and Batte∣ries to be carried off, and Shipped on their Gallies; and thereupon quitted at once all his Approaches, Guards, and Re∣trenchments, and marched back with the whole Army to Salankement, leaving no∣thing in his Camp but some few Shovels, and three Dead Bodies; neither could the Germans follow them, their Horse being Encamped on the other side of the River, and the Retreat of the Turks not having been perceived till the next Day; when immediately upon the discovery some Horse were sent after them, which returned with some stragling Turks only, the rest of their Army having passed the Save, and broke their Bridge down after 'em: And thus the Turks ended this Campaign; but the Germans had the good fortune to joyn the City of Giula to their other Conquests. Towards the end of this Month of Sep∣tember,Scio taken by the Ve∣netians. News came in an unexpected and astonishing manner to Adrianople, That the Venetians had Surprized the Island of Scio, and in a few Days, without much difficulty, had made themselves Masters of the whole Island. At first both the Castle and the Forts Ca∣pitulated, and on the 19th all was yield∣ed up; and the same Day the Turkish Gar∣rison was by agreement Transported into Anatolia, and Disbarked at Chisme, (as the Turks call it) being the nearest Land unto the Island. With this News the Turks were affected with a most Terrible Consternation; and then those two long Words might have been said of them Consternabantur Constanti∣nopolitani. The News was so surprizing at first, that no Man would believe it; but various and frequent Reports confirmed the Truth thereof; and tho' to the great Mor∣tification of the Turks, the News came confirmed from all Hands, yet the Turks comforted themselves with the Thoughts, that that Island could not remain long in the Hands of the Venetians. The Sultan howsoever cheared himself up with better Successes by Land; and gave order to the Grand Vizier to fight the Germans upon what Terms soever should be offered; but the Vizier returned for An∣swer, That his Forces were so weak this Year for want of the Asiatick Troops, that he was unable to fight the Christians; which if he should attempt to do, he should un∣doubtedly Sacrifice all to the Ruine of the Musselman Cause, and Destruction of the Ottoman Army. For the truth was, the Grand Vizier had then but a very small Ar∣my, consisting of 11000 Janisaries, and 6000 Albanians under their General Meh∣met Oghla, an Albanian, together with 20000 between Spahees and Segmen, with some Troops belonging to Pashees, and 7000 Tartars: Besides which, Money was all this Year very scarce. Asia was all in Confusion, and in want of every thing; so that it was no wonder that the Number of true Janisaries should be no greater in the Field; for Kara Musta∣pha when he went against Vienna, had no more than 14000;The ill con∣dition of the Tur∣kish Af∣fairs. and the famous Sultan Morat, when he went against Bagdat, had no more than 16000, which would not appear strange, in case it were considered, that in the whole Empire, the entire num∣ber of Janisaries consists not of more than 40000 truly Lawful, and Legitimate Jani∣saries; three parts of which, in the times of Peace, are lodged in Garrisons, as Can∣dia, Negropont, Rhodes, Cyprus, and in o∣ther Islands, as also in Greece, which are parts of the Morea, and on the Confines of Persia, where the most considerable Numbers are lodged; to which may be added Caminieck, Osi, Asack in the Black-Sea, as also in Dalmatia, Bosnia, and other Confines. With this Answer of the Grand Vizier to the Sultan, and representation of the present State of the War, the Grand Seignior yielded to the Urgency of the Times, and permitted the Vizier to return to Adrianople, and the Soldiers to their Winter-Quarters; the which was done with so much Precipitancy, that the Mo∣tion looked more like a Flight, than a Re∣treat. The which News being on the 18th of October brought to Adrianople, all things looked very melancholy, and the People began to droop with sad Countenances, the Grand Vizier returning back with Shame and Silence; when on the 15th of the Month all things appeared in a most Tu∣multuous
manner at Adrianople, and par∣ticularly in the chief Mosch there, called Sultan Solim, in which at all times of Prayer, there is a great Concourse of People, and those of the best sort, and of the greatest Officers of State, having their best and most sumptuous Palaces near thar Mosch, which is the finest and stateliest part of all the City. It was now early about the time of Morning Prayer, or so soon as the Sabbana Maaz was ended, People being still upon their Knees with much Silence and Devo∣tion,A Seditious Preacher. as their custom is, when a bold Turk well Learned, and of a smooth Tongue, mounted the Pulpit, having several Com∣plices attending beneath to defend him, in case any Attempt should be made upon: He began with a daring Speech, to inveigh a∣gainst the Government; crying out, Musselmen, or Believers, YOU are all at this time obliged to stand up for the Faith, for your Country, and Government. You cannot but be sensible that the Chri∣stians Attack us both by Sea and Land: That we have a Sultan who Attends to nothing; and a Great Vizier who is not Acquainted, or Practised in Affairs either Civil, or Mili∣tary: Wherefore let us all run to the Gate of our Mufti, and there cry out, and exclaim for a Change of Government. Do you not observe what a Capricious Fool we have for a Vizier, how Obstinate, and Ig∣norant, and how he daily commits a thousand Follies? Whilst all People were attentive to hear him, two Aga's belonging to the Chima∣cam, being near the Gate of the Mosch, and over-hearing the Discourse, run away with it to the Chimacam their Master; who immediately without any delay, or stop, in a trembling manner mounted on Horseback, and taking with him his Ser∣vants, Officers, and Janisaries all Armed, and Commanded by the Lieutenant-Gene∣ral of the Janisaries, ran to the Mosch, and made this Seditious Preacher to be seized, which caused great Confusion and Noise through the whole City; for appeasing which, the Chimacam took a large Turn through all the High Streets of Adriano∣ple. At that time it happened that a certain Pasha arrived within a few Hours of Adri∣anople,October. who had been Banished by Com∣mand of the Sultan, for many Robberies and Thefts he had committed in the Pub∣lick Treasury; his Name was Benli Hu∣saein Pasha, whose Head he took off; as he did in like manner, and at the same time the Head of one Musa Aga, and threw them both into the first Court-yard of the Se∣raglio, before the Gate of the Divan, de∣claring that these two were of the Seditious Mutineers, who had raised the Tumult in the City, which terrified a little for the present; which when the Chimacam per∣ceived, he was encouraged to proceed, and took 11 Officers, who were Ring-lead∣ers of the Sedition, whose Heads were heaped up together before the Divan-Door, and their Bodies thrown into the Cannels in divers parts of the City: A∣mongst these, was an Officer of the Grand Seignior's Stables, called Bekir Aga, a Talking, Mutinous Fellow; as also a Fool∣ish Astrologer, with 22 others, who were one Night all Strangled, and their Bodies thrown into the River Tongi,A Sedition quelled. (which runs near to the Grand Seignior's Palace at A∣drianople) and in this manner the Chima∣cam prevented a Mutiny, and quashed a Rebellion which was rising to a dangerous height: Howsoever the People murmured, but durst not speak so Audaciously as be∣fore. After these Tumults were over at Adri∣anople, People began to discourse of Prodi∣gies, strange Sights, and Apparitions; and among others, a Report was at Constanti∣nople, That an Owl was seen at Noon-day, sitting on the Old Pyramid in the Market-place; which as was reported, fell down of it self that Night, and next Morning there was found within the Basis of the Pyramid, a piece of Wax, on which was inscribed in Greek Characters, these Words. After 300 Years, this Monarchy will suf∣fer Great Destruction and Ruine, both by E∣nemies at Home and Abroad; And this Ci∣ty will be Infested by Pestilence, and by Earthquakes reduced to a Heap of Stones. All these Stories and Reports being ag∣gravated to the Grand Seignior, put him into a grievous Affrightment,The Sultan sends in haste for the Grand Vizier. so that in all haste he dispatched Posts one after the o∣ther to fetch the Grand Vizier from Bel∣grade to Adrianople; but howsoever he would not move until first he had supplied Temeswaer with all sorts of Provisions; for want of which the Turks died of Fluxes, and all sorts of Camp Diseases; and lying
on wet Grounds, and upon Morasses, more Men died than would have done in a Day of Battle. By these means the whole Turkish Ar∣my was reduced to 30000 fighting Men; to repair which, and make the Numbers to seem a little more formidable, they for∣ced, and Pressed about 10000 Artisans and Country Men, Raw, and Unexperienced Fellows, to make a Shew of, which had they most died, the World would scarce have missed them, only the Albanians, a Stout and Valiant People, were to be la∣mented, of which not one half returned in∣to their own Country. The Mufti and others growing sensible of their Low and Miserable Condition, and overwhelmed on all sides by Enemies, by Sicknesses, by Famine, and Poverty, wrote a Letter to the Scheriff,The Mufti's Letter to the Scheriff exhorting him to Peace, at such a time as this is, when the Enemies to the Mahometan Cause over∣whelmed them in all Parts; declaring, That without betraying the Musselman Cause, they could not persist in their Wars against the Sultan; and therefore they exhorted them to retire into their own Dominions, and to live quietly there,Letters to Exhort the Scheriff to Peace. rather than to expose the Holy Religion to the Insults of Infidels. By this Letter, and other Advices, which were seconded by many Exhortations of the Religious, and Holy Seighs, or Preachers, in their respective Monasteries, the Scheriff seemed to be somewhat ap∣peased, and to relent a little of his re∣vengeful Humour against the Turks: Be∣sides the meaner Princes of the Arabians, who are the most Religious, and Supersti∣tious of all the others, falling off from the Alliance with the Scheriff, on the score of Religion, things became more quiet in A∣rabia, and gave the Turks less Fears, and Apprehensions than before. Moreover Calailicos Ahmet Pasha, a cun∣ning Sophister (of whom we gave lately an Account) having been sent from Con∣stantinople with some Forces against the Scheriff, changed his Method from Arms, to Epistles, Sermons, and Exhortations, perswading him, that since he saw so many Martyrs on all sides, Dying for the Maho∣metan Cause, that he should not add to the Slaughter of the Musselmen, nor joyn with Infidels to the Destruction of the True Faith. To these were added also divers Letters from other Pasha's, as also from Mulla's, Seighs, and Cadi's of the most esteem in Asia; which so prevailed upon the Mind of the Scheriff, that he for some time desisted from all Hostilities upon the Turks. Notwithstanding which, the Eastern Princes bordering on Arabia, were a little cautious how they trusted the sincerity of the Scheriff; for in despight of all his fair Words, they would not be decoyed to leave their Country open, and exposed to the Mercy of the Ishmaelites, a People that never kept Faith; so that the Turks recei∣ved no more Forces from Asia, the follow∣ing Year, than they had done in this pre∣sent, by reason of the Jealousie they con∣ceived of the Arabians. Notwithstanding the pressing Desires of the Sultan,The Vizier delays his return. to hasten the return of his Vi∣zier, he made his Excuses to delay his Journey; alledging, That Prince Lewis had been reinforced by considerable Re∣cruits, and therefore it was necessary to observe his Motions; that the Floods by the Land-Waters, caused by perpetual Rains, made it impossible for the Army to march without Hardships, and unsuppor∣table Labours: But at length the old Year drawing towards an end, and it becoming necessary to provide for the Actions, Wars, and Counsels of the New, the Vizier was forced to leave the Army; which he did with great haste, and arrived before Adri∣anople about the 8th or 10th of December; where he remained under his Tents, ma∣king a show as if he intended to march in∣to the Morea, with intention to recover Scio; but before this Design was resolved, a Conference was held in the Vizier's Tents, where the Mufti was present; af∣ter which the Chimacam was called, as al∣so the Aga of the Janisaries, and the Aga of the Spahee's, with divers other Offi∣cers, who returned back with the Grand Vizier; at which Assembly it was conclu∣ded, That by reason of the urgency of the Times, and that the Imperialists were chief∣ly to be attended, as being the strongest, and most considerable Party, the Grand Vizier should remain at Adrianople, to raise new Forces, and prepare for the Wars of the following Year. But as to the present, that all their Thoughts and Stratagems should be employed for the recovery of the Island of Scio, the which obstructed all Correspondencies and Commerce with Smyrna, Rhodes, and even with Egypt it self; so that Coffee, Rice, and Sugar, were raised to an excessive Price: Wherefore cost what it would, it was agreed, That that place was the first to be taken; for which Expedition Misir-Oghli was appoint∣ed Captain-Pasha,The Turks design to recover Scio. an old experienced Sea-Captain. To provide against which At∣tempt, the Venetians put all things in good order both by Sea, and Land; and in all Places where they suspected that the Ene∣my might Land, and make their Descent,
they raised Forts, and planted Cannon, and supplied all necessary Provisions against a Siege, giving a report, That they would make it as strong as Malta it self. The Sultan being sensible that his Peo∣ple were become much disheartned and weakned by the many Misfortunes and Troubles which they had sustained, gave Orders to the Chimacam of Adrianople, named Mustapha Pasha,The good Qualities of Musta∣pha Pasha. to treat the People with Kindness and Civility: This Chima∣cam was a prudent Person, and being a lo∣ver of Justice, and tender of the Welfare of the People, was esteemed and well spoken of by all; and having known Miseries and Hardships during the time that he had undergone a Slavery in Poland, he knew the better how to commiserate the Afflicti∣ons of others: But above all, as Matters stood now in these Times, the great Con∣cern of a Chief Governour was to prevent Tumults and Insurrections of the People; of the danger of which the late Disturban∣ces had given a pregnant Example, and so moved the Spirit of the Chimacam to prose∣cute the Offenders, that 315 were put to Death at Adrianople, for the aforesaid Se∣dition; and six of the principal Officers being forced to fly to Constantinople, were there taken, and being put into Sacks, were strangled, and after the Ancient Fa∣shion thrown into the Sea; the which had been amongst the Romans the Punishment for Parricides, Insui voluêrunt in culeum vivos & dejici in mare. After the Conference which the Grand Vizier had held at his Tents with the Principal Ministers of State, he made di∣vers Dispatches into several Parts; namely Halil Pasha, whom he made Seraskier in the Morea, with Instructions to keep a watchful Eye upon the Island of Negro∣pont. Likewise three Aga's were dispatched to Algier, Tripoli, and Tunis, to hasten their Maritime Preparations, tho' with little hopes of success, by reason that those Go∣vernments in Barbary were at Wars one with the other, and had great Jealousies a∣mongst them. At this time also Orders came from A∣drianople directed to the Chimacam, and Lieutenant-General of the Janisaries, to provide Quantities of Rice, and other Pro∣visions for the Relief of Temeswaer, which for want thereof was greatly distressed; and so Orders were given all the way on the Road thither, to take up all the Wag∣gons and Carts that they could meet with, by that time that they came to Philippopolis and Sophia, might make up a Number of 300; which might probably prove a suffi∣cient Convoy to secure them; And for a better Reinforcement, Orders were given for the enrolling of 300 Janisaries, being new raised Soldiers; and with such Prepa∣rations as these for the next Campaign, ended this Year. Anno 1695. THIS Year began with a most Terri∣ble Fire in Constantinople,  which con∣sumed 4000 Houses and Shops towards that part where stands the Historical Pil∣lar, which is about the middle of the City; which Accident gave some stop to the Counsels then in hand; howsoever the Preparations for the next Years War by Sea and Land proceeded. The Tartar came to Adrianople, where he spent the remainder of the Winter in Conferences with the Grand Vizier, and other Principal Officers of State, in order to carry on the War both by Sea and Land: And whereas all sorts of Provisions were become very dear both in Adrianople and Constantinople, by reason that the Seas were obstructed by the Venetians, so that no Coffee, Rice, nor Sugar, could be tran∣sported from Egypt into those Parts; the French Ambassador undertook to supply the same with French Ships, demanding only, That when such Commodities arrive, the Turks should pay no more for them, than in Times of Peace; which besides some o∣ther private Contracts were very pleasing to the Turks, and served to confirm the Friendship, and increase the Confidence be∣tween the two People. As the Eyes of all the Turkish Officers were intent on the War, there being a De∣sign to recover Scio in the Winter Season, before the Venetians could come forth with their Fleet, the Sultan sent for Mezzo Morto, who was Admiral of the Fleet, together with six Captains of the Men of War, re∣proaching them for Cowardice; for that in case they had done their Duty in the last Engagement against the Venetians, Scio had not been lost; wherefore these Officers were discharged of their Commands, and Sarhos or Drunken Chusaein Pasha, was declared Captain Pasha, or Admiral, in the Place of Mezzo Morto; being esteemed a Man of more Boldness, and Courage, and Conduct, than the other; and such was the Shame, and Confusion that the Turks conceived for the loss of Scio, that even in the Winter, a thing not practised by the Turks, Orders were given to the New
Admiral to prepare, and equip an hundred Frigats. Whilst all things were preparing for this Years War, and in an especial manner for the recovery of Scio, on the 27th of Janu∣ary,Sultan Achmet's Death. Old Stile, the Grand Seignior Sultan Achmet dyed, which for that present put a stop to all Business then in agitation both in regard to the War, or Peace: For as to the latter my Lord Paget arrived at Adri∣anople on the 23d, and next Day desired an Audience of the Grand Vizier, which was promised to him on the 31st, when the Propositions he had to make, were so reasonable, and the Turks in so good a Temper that the Ambassador perswaded himself that they would be accepted, the Great Vizier, and Chimacam showing themselves not averse, but rather well incli∣ned to a reasonable Peace. But whilst they were thinking of these things, the Court, and City, and all Peo∣ple were surprized to hear the News of the Death of the Sultan; who at the time of his last Agony, desired to see and speak with his Successour Sultan Mustapha, who could not be perswaded to go to him, and so he died without that Satisfaction, by a great Defluxion, or Catarrh, which fell upon his Lungs: Only he left it in Com∣mission to his Servants, to acquaint his Nephew, Sultan Mustapha, who was un∣doubtedly to succeed him, That all he had to desire of him was, to desire him that he would permit his Son to live; but whether this Request was granted him or not, is not yet known; for Matters of this Na∣ture are seldom reported without the Walls of the Seraglio. So soon as he was dead, Mustapha Eldest Son to Sultan Mahomet IV. was proclaim∣ed, and saluted Emperor, and all passed without any Disturbance, Disorder, or In∣convenience whatsoever. In very few Hours afterwards the Body of the Deceased Achmet was hurried away to Constantinople, and with a small Atten∣dance buried in the Sepulcher of his Bro∣ther, and immediately the Sultana, his Mother, was required to hasten thither and retire, and Expresses dispatched to all Parts to carry and divulge the News, and most especially acquaint the New Valide Sultana with the Exaltation of her Son to the Throne of his Father. For the present Sul∣tan Mustapha being about 33 Years of Age, and in his Prime, appeared very Robust, and Comely, and to show a mildness of Spirit at the beginning, he for the present confirmed the Great Vizier in his Place, by restoring the Seals to him which he had resigned into his Hands, and giving him a Coftan lined with Sables. His Mo∣ther was now every Day expected at A∣drianople, until whose coming thither, no∣thing was to be done; for as she was a Person highly beloved, and esteemed by her late Husband Sultan Mahomet, Father of the present Sultan Mustapha (as we have manifested in our foregoing History) so she was a Woman of Intrigue, and one who had so great a Power over her Son, that he entirely gave himself up to the Go∣vernment and Guidance of his Mother.The Queen Mother. She was a Native of Canea (tho' some say she was a Circassian born) and taken from thence when the Place was first possessed by the Turks; her Father was a Protopapa, or Bishop of that place. His first entrance into Business was to enquire after the State of the Treasury; and to inform himself therein,Sultan Musta∣pha's Be∣ginnings. he called for the Treasurer, and demanded of him, How much Money there was in the Trea∣sury? To which Answer was made, Fif∣teen Purses: What then (said he) is become of all the rest? To which it was answered, That his Predecessor had disposed of it: It is well, (said he) and I shall take it from them who have received it. With these Beginnings it was much fear∣ed that he would prove a troublesome Neighbour to all Christendom; and a Cruel and a Severe Master to all the surviving Ministers of State; but things were carri∣ed so closely, that the Government had no News of any thing until the Successor had carried his Point, and secured every thing for his Establishment; to which many things concurred, as that he was the Son, and lineally descended from Sultan Maho∣met IV, who after a Reign of 48 Years, was Deposed, by reason of the Ill Fortune, and Avaritious Temper of some of his Mi∣nisters, or to please the Soldiers, who said, That he had Lived and Reigned long e∣nough. Moreover the People had a great Esteem for this his Son, being Young and Handsome, and in his Robust and Mature Age; nor was there any Person able to stand against him, nor capable of being of∣fered to the Soldiery for their Emperor: There was none of the Ottoman Family known unto the World, but a Child of two Years old, the Son of the late Sultan Ach∣met, and of such an one in such a Conjun∣cture of time, it was not so much as to be thought of; tho' most of the Ministers in Power did all they could to keep Sultan Mustapha from the Throne. His Beginnings were very brisk,The Grand Vizier put into fear. (for besides what he said to the Treasurer) he startled the Grand Vizier, and all the Pa∣sha's of the Bench, who knew not what to say, or act, or resolve, or whom to trust,

This suddain change humbled much of the Spirit of the Grand Vizier, so that he did not adventure to act so freely in Business as he had formerly done in the time of Sultan Achmet: For tho' he had received several Favours of his New Master, which served to encourage him at first, yet they were so mixed with his Frowns, and Im∣perious Threats, that he thought not him∣self safe, but lived in a continual appre∣hension of Death. When the Grand Seignior Vested him, as is commonly done by every Sultan at his Inauguration;Sultan Mustapha his Saying. he told him, That he should be careful what he did, that he should treat his Soldiers well, and above all, that he be sure to tell him the truth; and if not, he should soon know and be sensible of what would follow: But since this Severity,The Sultan's Humour. and sharp Saying, he re∣mitted something of his Angry Temper, and became more mild and easie; so that to encourage and raise his Spirit a little, he sent his Kuzlir-Aga in Ceremony with a great Attendance, to carry to the Grand Vizier a Prayer, which he himself had composed in the time of his Solitude, and Seclusion from the World, which were re∣ceived with profound Respect; the Bearer himself had five Purses presented to him, and the Chief of his Attendants was treat∣ed with several Rich Vests, and the others of meaner Degree had a good number of Zaichins distributed amongst them.February. The Grand Seignior also would not want his own Present, which was in Horses, and Jewels, several Young Damsels, richly a∣dorned, with above 100 Purses of Mo∣ney; and yet for all this the Vizier thought not himself safe, nor did the bitter Thoughts of Death pass from him: for whilst he was trembling for himself, he received a Hatte-sheriff, or a Royal Command from the Hand of the Grand Seignior, requiring him to command the Chiaus Pasha to Arrest the Chimacam of Adrianople, the Vizier's own chief Creature and Confident, and to put him between the Gates, a Prison for great Personages: The Fault objected to his Charge was, That in the time of the late Sultan Achmet, he had put to Death two of this present Sultan's Favourites, for en∣deavouring to promote the Interest of their Master, to the Prejudice of the Ruling Prince. Notwithstanding all which Mor∣tifying Commands, and Accidents, the Grand Vizier appeared outwardly with a chearful Countenance, for the least Sad∣ness would have been interpreted for Con∣tumacy, and a Discontented Spirit a∣gainst the Commands and Pleasure of his Master; for which reason he bore up brave∣ly against all Misfortunes, concealing the Agitations of his Mind from all those who had Business with him, and even from his own Domesticks. At this time my Lord Paget Ambassa∣dor from His Majesty King William,Lord Paget at Adri∣anople. was then at Adrianople, watching an Opportu∣nity to make Proposals for a Peace with the Emperor, of which, tho' about the lat∣ter time of Sultan Achmet, there was a great and a fair appearance; yet after his Decease this young Sultan mounting the Throne, all the hopes vanished, he him∣self being of a hot and fiery Spirit, was fully resolved to try his Fortune in the War, from which Design neither his Mo∣ther, nor his Women, nor his greatest Fa∣vourites could divert them. And the Kiah-Bey himself, who was Lieutenant-General, of the Janisaries, a Person of great Esteem, and Power in the Army, was disgraced, and put out of Office, for arguing in the Divan against the Grand Seignior's taking ths Field this Year in Person. These Changes had disconcerted all the Measures which my Lord Paget had taken towards a Peace, of which there now re∣mained no hopes for this Year; for the Sultan was not to be removed from his Re∣solution, nor the Soldiery averse to it, ha∣ving fixed it in their Minds, that this Sul∣tan was Lucky and Fortunate, and was to restore all that had been lost, since the Siege of Vienna, and the fatal Managements of the Grand Vizier Kara Mustapha. And to this purpose the Grand Seignior discour∣sing with the Vizier, he told him, how sensi∣ble he was of the evil management of Af∣fairs in the Empire, and that they were much worse than they had been in the time of his Father; to restore which to a better Condition, he again declared his Resolu∣tion to try his Fortune for another Year; the which not succeeding well, he was of an Opinion, That he could at any time make a Truce with the Christians, which perhaps he might be inclined to accept next Year, not out of a Necessity thereof, but in consideration to his People, to whom, after a long War of 17 or 18 Years, he was glad to give Ease and Quiet; for he was sensible, that the Ottoman Empire was in great Disorder, by reason of the Igno∣rance, Negligence, and ill Administration of some of the principal Ministers of State, which he would make it his Care to re∣medy. With these Resolutions of the Sultan, all things were preparing to take the Field early with a strong Army; it being di∣vulged, and published amongst the Sol∣diery, that their first March should be to∣wards
Belgrade, from whence if they could have made any Conquest on the other side of the Save, the Turks might yet (as low as they were) have proved a troublesome, and a dreadful Enemy to all Germany. And indeed the Christians were more sensible hereof than formerly; for the Turks had lately had many lucky Hits to encourage them, and which did indeed animate the People very much, seeming to them like good Omens of Change of Fortune in their favour: For the Venetians had in two se∣veral Engagements at Sea been worsted by the Turks, which was the cause of the Sur∣render of Scio to the Turks, of which they possessed themselves without any great Difficulty; where tho' the loss the Veneti∣ans had sustained both in Ships, and Men, was very considerable, yet the loss of their Reputation at Sea, was much more, and of a more evil Consequence; for the Turks animated hereby, fell boldly upon the Ve∣netians in the Morea, and put them to the Rout, fansying the Summer following to regain all again, despising now the Enemy which lately they durst not see, and were affraid to approach. To these good Fortunes of the Sultan, the News was added by way of Moldavia, of a great Victory that the Tartars had obtained against the Poles; which with the Successes the Ottoman Pasha's had ob∣tained against the Rebels in Asia, put all things at the Port into a smiling Conditi∣on, no Man doubting, but that the influ∣ence of these prosperous Beginnings would crown all the Actions of this New Sultan, with Success and Victory. The Fight between the Poles and the Tartars, in the Suburbs of Leopolis, hap∣pened on the 11th of February of this Year, being Extracted out of a Letter of the Great General, Written to the Envoy Cavalier Proski, of the 16th of February from Leopolis. An Extract of the Great Gene∣ral's Letter, Written to the Envoy Cavalier Proski. WE have not only in the Season of the last Spring, but during the whole Summer, and Autumn, lived in continual Alarms, and Skirmishes with our Enemies, but even in this very Win∣ter been engaged with them in divers Bloody Fights: And particularly on the 11th of this Month of February, a Bat∣tle was made between 3000 of our Sol∣diers, against 70000 Tartars, within the Suburbs, and under the Walls of Leo∣polis: The Particulars of which, are these. Sultan Zabas Gerei,A Fight between the Poles and the Tar∣tars. Son of the Tartar-Han, who in the Month of October last, gave up to our Hands, all the Provisions belonging to the Turks, which he had ta∣ken into his Care and Conduct to be Con∣voyed to Kaminieck; of which Disgrace, and Dishonour his Father being very sen∣sible, urged the Son to repair his Credit by some great Action worthy the Fame of his Valour, and his Prowess in War: Accordingly being assisted by all the Power of the Tartars, as well those of Budziac, Bialogrod, and Dobrucz, as those of Crim, who the last Year had joyned with the Turks under Peter Waradin, came on the 10th of this Month of Fe∣bruary, and Encamped themselves in the Plains of that Town, which is called the Cracovian Leopolis, with intention to fix his Camp there; and from thence to send out his Parties to all Places, where they could Burn and Spoil, make Slaves, and put all to Fire and Sword; and so they Ravaged every where for the space of eight Days, until at length all the Coun∣tries round being alarm'd hereat, I raised all the Forces that I was able, and brought them together from their respective Quar∣ters, which alas, was a most inconsidera∣ble Power against so Mighty an Enemy; for all that we could gather, and unite, did not amount to more than 3000 fight∣ing Men. The Day following about Eight of the Clock in the Morning, the Sultan Tartar drew out his Men into form of Battle; and I also having my Confidence in God, drew out that Handful of Men which I had with me, and made a Sally out of the City to cover the Suburbs. The Enemy staid not long to look on us, but seeing some Polish Companies to march boldly against them, they Detached a Party of Tartars to meet and engage them, and to force the Outworks, which were only for∣tified with Hedges, and a kind of Wall made up with Mats and Rushes well wo∣ven together. This Command was exe∣cuted with such Vigour, that doubtless the Place had been carried at the first At∣tack, had not the danger wherein they were of losing their Lives, and Estates, and all they had, made them desperate,
and forced them to make all the resistance that they were able; and in effect they fought like Lyons, receiving the Enemy so bravely, that in a short time all the Fields were covered with the Dead Bodies of the Slain. The Tartars made Thir∣teen Attacks to try their Fortune, and were as often repulsed by the Chri∣stians, without any great loss on their side. This Fight continued four Hours, un∣til at length the Enemy observing that all their Assaults prevailed little, but were very Bloody, and of great loss, they re∣solved, That at the same time, when they engaged us in the Front with one Party, they should break in upon the Hedge with another, and whatever loss, or Blood it should cost, to carry it by main force, as it immediately proved; for the Enemy having by this means got between us and the City,The Tar∣tars beaten. we remained without any hopes imaginable of relief; howsoever with a Courage full of resolution to overcome, or die like Brave Men, turning our Faces upon them, to whom we had but newly turned our Backs, we did not only over∣come them, but cut a great Number of them in pieces; and after another Engage∣ment, which lasted about two Hours more, drove them out of the Suburbs of the City; tho' in the time of this Fight, the Tartars having set Fire thereunto, the Wind, and Smoak, and Dust did so in∣commode our People, that they were in a manner Blinded, and knew not which course to take; howsoever their Invinci∣ble Courage was such, as that the Enemy was put to Flight. This Fight continued until Three a Clock in the Afternoon, by which time they had been so beaten, that they were forced to withdraw before the Evening, about a League and a half from the City,The Tar∣tars with∣draw. and the next Day proceeded on their March; and the third Day passed the Neister, on their way homewards. The Number of the Slain on the Chri∣stian side did not exceed above 100, and about 160 Wounded; what the Enemy lost, is not to be known. But such Matters as these, at so far a di∣stance, and between Tartars and Poles, did not much affect, or trouble the Ottoman Court; but such as were nearer hand, as Naval Fights, and the Taking and Reco∣vering of the Island of Scio, being near the Royal Cities, made great noise both in Europe and Asia, and raised the hopes of the People to great and high Expectations of the future Fortune of this New Sultan, as if he had been born to be Restorer of the decaying Condition of the Ottoman Empire. We have related already the ill Success which the Venetians had had in two several Fights at Sea against the Turks,Scio re∣gained by the Turks. which be∣ing unusual, and of many Years not known, made it matter of Wonder to all the World. For after the Turks had beaten the Venetian Fleet, all things were put into great Con∣sternation at Scio, so that the Venetian Com∣manders most shamefully abandoned the Place, stealing away in the Night without giving time for some of their Troops which were abroad to guard the Island, to Em∣bark with them, which gave cause to some of their Officers, who thereby became Slaves to the Turks, to vent out Thousands of Imprecations and Curses upon them; and indeed their Case was sad, but Neces∣sity had no Law, for the Venetians had now been beaten twice at Sea by the Turks, who had they followed their Blow, might have utterly destroyed the Venetian Fleet; but the Turks being contented with this unusual Success, a thing not known to them for more than a hundred Years past, were contented with the Flight of the Enemy, and therewith a Cession to them of the whole Island; and the Turks entered trium∣phant thereupon without any Opposition. The first Act of the Turkish Clemency was to Hang up four Men of the Latine Rite, who were of the Romish Church, and of the Italian Race; namely, Signior Pie∣tro Giustiniani di Antonio, Signior Domenico Stella, who were Deputies, ordained to protect that Religion; Signior Francesco Draco, and Giovanni Castelli di Brecci. Sig∣nior Sofiati, who was Vice-Consul for the English Nation in that Island, fled with his Family, and was well received at Tino: Do∣menico Castelli Son of Vincenzo Castelli, e∣scaped also, (with whom I was well ac∣quainted) together with forty of the chief Families of the Latine Rite, leaving their Possessions, and Moveables behind them: Antonio Rendi happened to be then at Smyr∣na; but his Family deferring their Depar∣ture, his House was Plundered, and all his Estate ruined like that of his Neighbours; for tho' they fled to Smyrna for refuge, by this Revolution the Greeks gained a clear Victory and Ascendant over the Latines: For whereas formerly there were great A∣nimosities between those two Rites; the Latines by reason of their Riches, having the Pope on their side, were always esteem∣ed
the Superiors, and by the great Colle∣ctions made for them, and Legacies be∣queathed, they gained much more of the Hearts and Favour of the Turks, than the Poverty of the Greeks was able to pur∣chase; but now a fair Opportunity hap∣pening of gaining and Confiscating all that appertained to the Latines, they seized on all that belonged to them; treating the Greeks more favourably,The Greeks in Scio fa∣voured by the Turks. because they be∣lieved them to be the less culpable, having the less Riches; and in reality the Greeks having been under the Dominion of the Turks for some Ages, were become almost their Natural Lord, from whom they ex∣pected better Quarter than from the Vene∣tians, or other Italians; and so always wished well to the Turks. Thus was Scio in a short time fallen again into the Hands of the Turks, from whence they are never again likely to recover it, unless the Vene∣tians amend their Politicks, and prove more Vigilant and Brave in the Wars both by Sea and Land; but that is not now to be expected, nor those of the Latines permit∣ted to live in that Island, unless they con∣form to the Rites of the Greek Church, the greatest part of which were restored to the Enjoyment of their Estates, with their Ancient Privileges; but the Latines were deprived of both, by the Instigation of their old Inveterate Enemies the Greeks; tho' at first they were put in hopes of obtaining the like, or equal Favours with them. After the Death of Sultan Achmet, and that Sultan Mustapha was exalted to the Throne; in the first place Achmet Pasha, Chimacam of Adrianople was Disgraced, and all his Goods and Estate Confiscated to the Use of the Grand Seignior,Changes at Court. and he himself made a Prisoner in the Seraglio, but pardoned at the Intercession of the Grand Vizier, and sent Governour to the Island of Mytilene, where I had once a Pa∣sha for a Friend Married to a Sultana, which had like to have cost me dear; but (God be praised) I escaped him without much loss. In the Place of this Chimacam, the Ni∣sangi Pasha, who sets the Grand Seignior's Firme to certain Writings, was put in his place; and the Vizier's Kahya into the Place of the Nisangi,March. and Gebegi Ibrahim Aga, was made Kahya. Upon the Arrival of the Valide Sultana at Adrianople, Iastiff Aga, who had been formerly Kahya to the Hasaki Sultana, or the Royal Queen, was Constituted Aga, or General of the Janisaries, and at the same time Vizier of the Bench: These were succeeded by the Spahyler Agasi, who is General of the Horse, and his Place supplied by a Salakiar of the Sera∣glio. About the beginning of March, Ymam-Sadè Mahomet Effendi, then Kadilesker of Romelia, was created Mufti by the Grand Seignior; and his Predecessor was sent to Constantinople, from whence the Sultan sent for Mimadi Effendi to be Kadilesker of Anatolia. The Nakib, who is the Chief of the Green Heads, or those of the Race of Mahomet, was deprived of this Office, and Mahomet Effendi, Kadi of Con∣stantinople, which was as much as Re∣corder of that City, was put into his Place. In like manner the Tefterdar-Kahyasi, or the Lord Treasurer's Steward, or Se∣cretary, called Galil Effendi, was also chan∣ged, who had been Treasurer in the Time of the foregoing Vizier Ali Pasha; and thus had he formed all his Court accord∣ing to his own Humour and Fancy. And as to the High and Sublime Offi∣ces Abroad, he began also to form and modelize them: That of Egypt, he Con∣ferred upon Ishmael Pasha, who had been lately Beglerbeg of Damascus; and the Government of this latter he bestowed on the Kadilesker of the Deceased Sultan Achmet. Hassan Pasha, who was Kinsman to the Queen Regent, late Governour of Scio, was called back to Court from his Banish∣ment at Hatsack, and made the Deputy-Chimacam, or Vikil-Chimacam, to Go∣vern at any time during the Grand Seig∣nior's Absence.
A LIST of such as were put to Death for the late Conspiracy at Adrianople. STRANGLED. BENGLI HASSAN PASHA, late Governour of Tripoli of Soria. BEHEADED. Hassan Turcman Agasi. Bester Aga, Salahor of the Grand Seignior. Weli, Aga of the Chimacam. Hassan Effendi, Kahya of the Chimacam. Mutpach Emmini, or Customer. HANGED. An Astrologer. These following were Banished. Fisula Effendi, formerly Mufti, who had been Banished to, and afterwards Exiled into the Upper Egypt. Johaia Effendi, late Kadilescher, sent to Aleppo. Mahomet Effendi Nakib, Banished to Aleppo. Ganziack Effendi, under Kadi of Galata, was sent to Lemnos. As was also Nissani Oglu Hussaein Aga, Favourite to the aforementioned Vizier, Ali Pasha. Besides these, were above a Hundred more Strangled of Inferiour Quality, whose Bodies were thrown into the River Meritz, which runs by Adrianople. The Valide Sultana being arrived at A∣drianople, was received with open Arms by her Son, who governed himself much by the Measures had been given him by his Mother, who made several Changes and Alterations every Day amongst the Offi∣cers of State; only the Grand Vizier and Mufti continued in their Offices, and the greatest part of the others consisted of Old Servants of the Court, established in the time of his Father Sultan Mahomet IV. of which the Queen-Mother had an Opinion that they would prove the most Faithful Servants of any in the Courr. To make room for these Men, the Chimacam, the Great Master of the Horse to the Sultan, the Chehaya-Bey, or Lieutenant-General of the Janisaries, (who is always more fear∣ed, and esteemed by the Soldiery than the Aga himself) were all displaced, with the Janisar-Aga, as also the Principal Offi∣cers of the Spahees; having an Opini∣on, That the Youngest are always the more Bold, and Daring, their Courages being excited with Ambition, and Vain-Glory. Things being in this manner modellized both for Domestick and Martial Affairs, the Grand Seignior again confirmed, and published his Resolution to go this Year to the War; and to make Provisions of Money to maintain the same, with the u∣sual Donative to the Soldiery, which was always given in former times, whensoever the Sultan made his first Years Cam∣paign. Those who were against the Grand Seignior's going in Person to the War, pres∣sed very hard the prevailing Argument of want of Money, to raise which, all means possible were contrived; for the Sultan would not be put by his Resolution, al∣ledging, That the Negligence of his Fa∣ther and Unkle's not going to War in Per∣son, had been the Ruine of the Ottoman Army, and the Cause of all those Losses, and Disgraces which his Empire had su∣stained; but Money must be found by one way or other; to do which, the Grand Vizier was strictly enjoyned to give an Account of Eighteen Millions in the space of Thirty Days, besides the Arrears due
to the Soldiery, in the Time of the last Sultan Achmet: And tho' the Grand Vizier alledged, That it seemed reasonable, that such as had managed the Publick Offices during the two preceding Reigns, should be answerable for the Miscarriages, and not he, who had been employed therein but only some few Months before; yet the Sultan would not admit of this Excuse for a Reason, but required the Account of the Eighteen Millions: His Mother also furnished her Son with Seven Millions and a half in ready Money, and Fifteen Mil∣lions in Jewels, which she had been colle∣cting in the space of fifteen Years that she had been the Wife of his Father; and from the Widow of the late Deceased Sultan Achmet, they took another half Million; the Vizier was Taxed at a Million and a half, and five Millions in Jewels; likewise a good round Sum was demanded from the Chimacam, and other Pasha's and Persons in great Offices. There was a farther Proposition made to screw Money out of all the Arabians, and Negro's at Court: The Kuzlir-Aga was the first of that Rank from whom the most considerable Sums were exacted; to pay which, their Estates and Faculties sent and conveyed out of sight to Constantinople, were all called from thence.March. The like was also demanded from the Ulema, and all the Ecclesiastical Lands and Estates were Taxed.All Persons Taxed. To execute all these Contrivances and Ways for raising Money, the Grand Seig∣nior was solely intent, labouring Day and Night to amass Money; and spent his whole time to heap up Riches; to do which, he acted many things without the knowledge of the Vizier, and wrote Let∣ters, and received Answers relating to the raising Men, and providing Subsistence for the Troops without interesting his Grand Vizier therein; the which struck such a Fear and Terrour into the Minds of all those who had to do with the Publick In∣terest, that none durst to act any thing privately, or in an obscure manner, which might be of prejudice to the Grand Seig∣nior, and his Government. To keep this Sultan in the Humour of going to the War, his Mother laboured to keep up his Spirits; which being observed by the great Men, such as the Mufti, the Grand Vizier, the Lord Treasurer, and the Generals of the Janisaries, and of the Spa∣hees, they all submitted thereunto, only they gave in a Petition to be delivered to the Sultan by the Hand of the Valide Sol∣tana, or Queen-Mother; representing, That since they had observed that it was His Majesty's Resolution to go in Person to the War, they were concurring with him in the same, promising to be helpful therein to the best of their Powers; be∣seeching only, That His Ottoman Majesty would be pleased to Indulge them so much time, as might serve to assemble, and ga∣ther their Militia into a Body, and to make Provisions for their Subsistence, as also Ammunition, and Cannon, with Pow∣der and Bullet sufficient to attend so great an Army: Of all which they gave the Sultan in Writing a particular Account in what forwardness all things were; and concluded, That since it is the Custom of the Germans to be late in the Field, they did not doubt but to be more forward than they, and to Grace and Honour the Sul∣tan's first Expedition with the Success of Glorious Atchievements, of which the Miscarriage would prove of evil Conse∣quence, as the contrary would be of migh∣ty advantage to the whole Ottoman Empire, which languishing after a Fortunate Sultan, would then think the Wheel turned in case they could see the end of a Campaign con∣cluded with Honour of a New Sultan. The Grand Seignior being sensible here∣of, raised all the Forces he was able, both in Asia and Europe: And to Engage the Tartar Han on his side, certain Aga's were dispatched to Tartary with Purses of Mo∣ney, with Presents of a Sword richly a∣dorned with Diamonds, and with rich Cof∣tans; as also with Presents to the other Kinsmen of the Han, and to the Mirzees, who are the Noble Men, and Chief Offi∣cers both of War and Peace, desiring them all to be early at the War; by which great Assiduity of the Sultan, all the Great Of∣ficers were in fear of him, knowing that as he Rewarded generously, so he Punish∣ed severely. The Grand Vizier in the mean time considering the Troubles under which he was to labour, as also the Invincible Diffi∣culties of the present War, in case the Sultan should persist in his Resolution of going in Person to Command the Army, he endeavoured what he could to obtain the Favour that he might lay down his Of∣fice, and quietly and safely retire from all Business; for which he made Talkish to the Grand Seignior, which is a Petition made by the Master of Requests; (of which there is but one belonging to the Court called Talkishgee) the substance of which was to lay before the Grand Seignior the impossibility of making the Donative to the Soldiers, amounting unto Twelve Mil∣lions, the which was always given by the Sultans to the Soldiers, whensoever they
made their first Campaign: This was so reasonable an Exception, and Excuse, that there was no reply to be made thereunto, but the absolute Will and Pleasure not to pay it; for besides the want of Money in the Treasury, which had been exhausted by a long and an unfortunate War, the Grand Seignior added, That he did not esteem himself obliged to a Custom which was begun in the most Flourishing Times of the Empire, when Success crowned all their Enterprizes with Victory, when the Ene∣mies were forced to pay all Charges of the War, with an Overplus of Riches and In∣crease, which filled the Royal Exchequer, and that Wars maintained the Empire: But those Days, added the Grand Seig∣nior, are now past; and that it would be an Insolence in the Soldiery, to expect a Donative from him, who was not in the least beholding to them for his being pla∣ced in the Throne, to which he came by Succession,A Donative refused to the Soldiers. and a Just Title, and not by the Favour and Assistance of the Soldiery; and that whosoever had opposed him there∣in (who was their True and Lawful So∣veraign) would have been guilty of High-Treason, and ought to Die by the Just Laws of the Empire. In this manner, the Wisest and most Ex∣perienced Officers observing how difficult, and almost impossible it was to divert the Grand Seignior from his Resolution of go∣ing in Person to the War, they all agreed to joyn with their Master, and to applaud his happy Designs, which they prayed to God might be prosperous, promising to give all Assistance with their Lives and For∣tunes, that he might return with Victory and Success: So soon were their Minds changed to the Will and Pleasure of their Absolute and Uncontroulable Lord, that none durst open his Mouth against his Determination, nor no Murmurings heard unless by some few Janisaries, who Talked a little, without any Notice ta∣ken thereof. The Grand Vizier finding himself also under Invincible Difficulties, thought it the safest way to close with the Sultan, which he accordingly did, and with much outward Zeal dissembled a Chear∣fulness of Spirit in Compliance with his Master. This Matter being resolved, it was con∣cluded, That an Army should be formed of 80000 Fighting Men, and the Tugh, or Horse-Tail, being with Prayers, after the usual manner, exposed at the Vizier's Gate, the 30th of March was appointed to take the Field, and enter the Tents, which are commonly pitched about two English Miles distant from the Gates: And the Grand Seignior to lose no time, Commanded that 2000 of his Pages, and as many others on Horseback, appointed for his Guard, should be at the appointed time in a readiness to attend the Sultan: But yet things went but slowly on, by rea∣son of the great Discords arisen in Asia,Retard∣ments to the Motion of the War. whereby many of the Chief Men had been killed, which gave a stop to the March of the Militia. To which also another stop was given by the News which the Tartar Han re∣ceived, That the Czar of Muscovy being joyned with the Cossacks, was passing down the Tanais, with design to fall upon Asac; of which he gave Advice to the Grand Seignior, by an Express dispatch∣ed to Adrianople, acquainting him, That the Enemies were grown so numerous, that he could not this Year send his Troops to Hungary, having hard Work to defend his own Country, and People, from so nu∣merous an Army as that of the Muscovites joyned with the Cossacks. But the Grand Seignior not satisfied with this Excuse, re∣turned an Answer, That notwithstanding all Impediments to the contrary, he must by all means come with a Numerous Army, and appear in his Presence; but this was impossible to be done, the Soldiers and People not being contented to please the Grand Seignior to see their Country laid open, and exposed to such a Powerful E∣nemy. This Grand Seignior Sultan Mustapha, when he came first to the Throne, was Feared, Esteemed, Loved, and Obeyed; but the Affection of his People was soon estranged from him,The Mufti Deposed, the Vizier Strangled. since he Deposed the late Mufti, and caused the Grand Vizier, with many other Persons, Innocent and Worthy, to be Strangled, with Ignominy and Dishonour. But the Mufti was most of all lamented, having the Reputation of a Just, Sincere, Honest, and a Holy Man, in whose place the Sultan established his late Hogia, or School-Master, named Fei∣zulah Effendi, a Wicked, False, Perfidious, and Covetous Wretch, as he was general∣ly esteemed to be. The Grand Vizier, (as we have said) was always affraid of the Changeable Hu∣mour of the Sultan, and could not cover his Passion, nor dissemble his Countenance; of which the Sultan taking notice, depri∣ved him of his Office, and Banished him at Midnight to Chisme, which is a small Vil∣lage on the Coast of Anatolia over against Scio; but this Proscription continued not long, before he was brought back again to Adrianople, and Strangled, and his Body
flung out at the Seraglio-Gate, where it remained until the next Day at Noon, with the Face and Beard all besmeared with a — At Adrianople all the Court was chang∣ed; only the Grand Seignior when he first entered upon the Throne, confirmed the Janisar-Aga in his Place, who was an Ho∣nest Man, and a good Soldier, but soon afterwards he put him out, and Constitu∣ted another in his Place, called Baltagée Deli, which signifies Mad Battle-Axe Man, the Son of an Armenian Renegade, a Vile Fellow, without Sence, or Manners: Like∣wise the Kahya-Bey, or Lieutenant-Ge∣neral of the Janisaries; and the Kuzlir-Aga, or Eunuch of the Women were dis∣placed; and in short since this Sultan came to the Throne, there was nothing done but placing and displacing of the Principal Officers; all which was acted by the Coun∣sels of Women, and Favourites in the Se∣raglio, who neither had Sence, nor Expe∣rience in the Affairs of the World. The like soon after happened to the Chimacam, who being a Friend to the late Vizier, and one of his Creatures, was Banished first to Mytilene, where he was likewise Stran∣gled; from whence his Head being brought to Adrianople, was thrown before the Gae of the Seraglio, with divers others esteem∣ed Innocent by the People. Thus the Sultan, as he thought, having purged his Army of Cowards, and his Counsels of Ill-affected Ministers, began his March from Adrianople on the 10th of June;June. the Janisar-Aga marched away on the 3d: The Army was said to be very powerful, and composed of Choice Men, which so encouraged the Turks, that they talked of nothing less than the taking of Buda; and about that time News came from Stalida de Zetuns, a small Island near Negropont, That Ibrahim, Pasha of that Island, had entered into the Morea with 30000 Men, and was Encamped under Corinth, expecting the Captain-Pasha, who was then designing to depart from Constan∣tinople in ten Days, where he had been detained longer than was usual, to repair the Damages which the Turks had received in their late Engagement against the Vene∣tians: Belonging to this Fleet, seven Ships were appointed for Alexandria to fetch Soldiers thence for the Morea; and like∣wise about this time Recruits were sent to the Black-Sea to several Ports there, the Turks being in fear of the Moscovites, who being very strong, the Tartars were affraid to encounter them, and would have ex∣cused themselves this Year from the War, but the Sultan would not hearken there∣unto, but proceeded with Resolution on his March. But before the Sultan began the same, he caused the Tallol, or Common-Cryer, to make Publication, That the Grand Seignior's Will and Pleasure was, That no Man going to the Wars,New Or∣ders for the Army. should be served by Young Boys. That good Order and Discipline should be observed in the March. That no Man should ride out of the Common High-Road, or by Bye-Ways, into the Corn-Fields, or Vine-yards, or other Grounds belonging to the Hus∣band-Man. In pursuance of these Commands, the Sultan on the very Day that he departed from the Camp before Adrianople, being then Teptil, or in Disguise, he found a Man cutting another's Corn to give his Horse; and only asking him, Whether he had heard of the Grand Seignior's Com∣mand? He ordered the Selictar-Aga, who was General of the Spahee's, for he had no other with him (excepting the Kapugi∣ler-Kahyase) at the same time to kill him, which he presently executed with his Lan∣cet, not giving the Unhappy Wretch one Moment to speak for his Life.The Grand Seignior's Severities. At the same time also, the Grand Seignior espyed another walking through the Corn, whom he took and carried to the Tents, where he caused his Head to be cut off. The Topgibashee, or Master of the Ordnance, likewise the Day or two before very hard∣ly escaped; for having a Boy in his Com∣pany, of whom the Grand Seignior had some Jealousie, or ill Thoughts, had cer∣tainly been put to Death for the same, had he not had some present Witnesses at hand to prove him to be his Son. These and such like Acts of Severity, rendered this Sultan very formidable, so that all People were afraid of him, not on∣ly in their Publick Actions, but even in their Private Conversation, scarce trusting their own Thoughts. Amongst these Se∣verities Achmet Pasha, late Chimacam to Sultan Achmet, was turn'd out of his Of∣fice by this present Sultan, and Banished to Mytilene; and after having taken from him an hundred Purses of Money, his Head was brought to Adrianople, about two Days after the Vizier had been Stran∣gled. All things being now prepared for the March of the Army towards Belgrade, the Janisar-Aga with his Janisaries, according
to the usual Custom took the Van, and marched away one Days March before the rest of the Army, so that the Grand Seig∣nior, attended by the Mufti, Grand Vi∣zier, Spahilar-Aga, or General of the Spa∣hees, Tefterdar, or Lord-Treasurer, be∣gan their March, following the Janisaries, on the 20th of June,June. but after some few Hours, they made a Halt to give time to three of the greatest Pashas, or Begler∣beys of the Empire, to come up with them; that is to say, to the Pasha of Da∣mascus, the Pasha of Aleppo, and Beglerbey of Anatolia, every one of which brought with him about 1200 Men, recounting Spahees, and Sarigiaus, and Segmen on Horseback, with all which and others at∣tending the Sultan in his March, they did not amount to more than 12000 Horse, with which he marched from Adrianople in six Days to Philippopolis, and Encamped o∣ver against that City in those Plains, where a great Council of War was held, touch∣ing the Methods which were to be obser∣ved in the War, and the Places which were to be Attacked. The Numbers of this Army appeared so small and inconsiderable, that the Sultan remained very much unsatisfied, and would not be contented, unless the Tartar Han would follow him with all his Force unto the Camp at Belgrade; but he positively refused it; and said, That it could not be done; unless he should expose, and lay his People open to the Incursions of the Mus∣covites, who were coming down in vast Numbers to over-run all the Regions of the Tartars: Howsoever not to displease overmuch the Grand Seignior, the Tartar Han forced himself to appear in the Tur∣kish Camp with an Army of about 5000 Tartars, which was a good addition to the Turkish Force, so that in all they composed an Army of about 50000 Men. The Christian Army led by the Elector of Saxony, was not much stronger, but ve∣ry desirous to meet the Turks, who had taken their March towards Transylvania: But in regard the Turks were so far advan∣ced before the Imperial Army, that it was impossible for the Elector to come in op∣portunely, and in season to succour the Places which the Sultan designed to Invest, unless they could take a shorter way, which was offered unto them, being guided by some of that Country; but the Ways pro∣ved so bad, being all Marshes and Wet Grounds, that it was impossible to pass them with the Cannon and heavy Baggage of an Army; so that after great Fatigues of three or four Days Marches, the Ele∣ctor was obliged to return back again to his former Camp; and in the mean time the Turks had got such a way before them towards Transylvania, that it was impossi∣ble for them to be overtaken by the Chri∣stian Army; and having liberty to rove every where without any Opposition equal to them, they fell in upon the Palanca of Lippa on the 7th of September,Septemb. without Breast-works, or Parapets, or any Ap∣proaches, Defence, or Shelter before them, but only with the Scimiter in their Hands, they Attacked the Palanca at four several Places, with such incredible Resolution, that after four Hours Engagement, they took the Place by Storm, and put all to the Sword, excepting only Major Toldo, who was Governour of the Place, with some others of the Principal Officers, whom the Turks after their usual Custom, reser∣ved to carry in Triumph, and to show them to the People at the Port, as one Signal of their Victory. In the mean time the Imperial Army continued their March near to Chonad, si∣tuate upon the River Maros; and on the 13th of that Month, pitched their Camp before Natla, where they reposed that Day, and the 14th marched directly to Lippa, hoping to overtake the Turks, and to come time enough to Attack the Enemy, and relieve the Place, but they found it too late, and the Turks reinforced with an Ar∣my of 6000 Tartars, Commanded by the Han in Person: This News gave a stop to the March of the Imperial Army under the Command of the Elector of Saxony; and what was most discouraging, was the News, That the Turks lead by the Sultan himself in Person were marched into Tran∣sylvania,Veterani defeated. to Attack Count Veterani in his Camp, which consisted not of above 6500 Men; who tho' they were very well for∣tified, and Resolute Men, and good Sol∣diers, yet being too unequal a Match for the whole Turkish Army, which consisted of 18000 Janisaries, and 40000 Spahees, they were all cut off, with the most part of their Officers, and as to General Vete∣rani himself he was shot through the Body with a Musquet-Bullet, and cut over the Head with a Scimiter; notwithstanding which, he being still alive, Endeavours were used for his Recovery, but he Died of his Wounds. This ill News was followed by the un∣fortunate Loss of Titul, which the Turks having Attacked by Land and Water with 15000 Men, the Place Surrendered it self to the Turks by Treaty, in vertue of which the Garrison consisting of 1600 Men, ought according to Articles, to have been Con∣voyed to Peter Waradin; but the Turks re∣turning
after they had Burnt, and Aban∣doned the Place, carried all the Garrison with them to Salankement. This Place was taken by the Turks, be∣fore that General Herberville, who was Encamped with 6000 Men near Kobila, as also fortified with 8 Galleys and 16 Frigats, could hinder the Enemies Approaches: After which the Turks leaving the Place, the Imperialists entered into the same, and took Possession of all what the Turks had ruined, for nothing was left but heaps of Rubbish. In the mean time the great Army under the Command of the Elector of Saxony, advanced so far as Solnak, where the Grand Seignior having received intelligence, That the Christian Army was marching towards him, hastned with all speed for Temeswaer, with intention to enter into Sclavonia: Upon which the Elector of Saxony made a Halt, and on the 17th marched back, and pitched his Camp about half an Hours di∣stance from Chonad; and the next Day be∣ing the 18th, continued his March as far as Mokoua. But whereas Advices came, That the Enemy designed to enter Transyl∣vania, the Elector resolved to send all the Infantry to Peter Waradin, whilst he in Person, marched with the Horse to op∣pose the Enemy, giving Commands to the National Militia of Sclavonia to joyn with the Croats, to oppose the Entrance of the Turks into that Province: And here it was, that certain Intelligence was given of the Defeat of that Worthy General Veterani, and that he was dead of his Wounds; which News was received with much grief of all Brave and Worthy Champions for the Christian Cause. After which Count Heisler took the Van of the Army, and marched before them for Deva, there to provide all sorts of Pro∣visions for sustenance of those who were to follow and to assemble the Estates of Tran∣sylvania, commanding them to meet His Electoral Highness, and consult with him in the best manner, how things might be put into a posture of Defence for the Safe∣ty and Security of that Province. At which time also came the unhappy News of the loss of Titul taken by the Turks. It was the common Opinion at that time of all the well experienced Soldiers, That the Martial Affairs of the Empire, were all very ill managed for that Year: For had the Christians instead of Ingulsing themselves amongst Marasses and Moorish Grounds unpassable for an Army, in which they lost six or seven Days, and gave the Turks the advantage of marching so many Days before them to Temeswaer, and thence to Lippa, they had saved the loss of Vete∣rani and his Forces at Lugos, as also Titul, and Karansebes, all which fell that Year for want of good Conduct; for the Turks were esteemed not stronger at that time than 40000 Men, and one half of them Raw and Undisciplined Soldiers;The ill Conduct of the Impe∣rial Army, in Anno 1695. but the Slowness, and Negligence of the Christians in that Years Expedition, broke all Mea∣sures, as if there had been a Fatality at∣tending this Years Actions: For no sooner did the Turks understand that the Imperial Army was marching after them, but being struck with a suddain Consternation, they Decamped with their whole Army from Lippa, more like Cowards flying before the Enemy, than in Order and Posture of War, marching Day and Night to get in∣to Temeswaer before the Enemy could over∣take them. But so soon as it was known to the Turks, that the Imperial Army was marched to Segedin, they took Courage, and gave a stop to their precipitate Flight. And here it was that Fortune changed, and gave unexpected Success to the Turks in this Years Expedition, which turned great∣ly to the Fame and Renown of this New Sultan Mustapha: For considering that he was but a raw Soldier, and kept himself in every Action at a distance and out of Musket-shot, yet the whole matter being carried on against the Opinion of all his Ministers, and the Inclinations of almost all his Soldiers, especially the Janisaries, and all the prime Officers of the Army and the State, things looked at first with a ve∣ry bad Face, and promised nothing but Destruction. Yet afterwards succeeding quite other∣wise than were expected, all was attribu∣ted to the Courage, Wisdom, and Conduct of the Sultan; so that it became a Wonder to the World how it was possible for a Sul∣tan without Experience, who had but new∣ly come out from an Imprisonment of eight Years, and known nothing yet of War, to be attended with such Success, that all his Army did avow, That his Victories were due to his Valour and Conduct, which gained him a wonderful Esteem amongst all the great Men of his Empire, both Martial and Civil; the Effect of which was found in the following Year,Great Ho∣nour gained by the Sul∣tan. when all the Sol∣diery being flushed with Blood and Spoil, came willingly to the War, and struck an Awe and Fear into the Hearts of all the Ottoman Subjects, believing this Prince to be sent them from God, to rescue them and the Empire from Ruine and utter De∣solation.
The Sultan being sensible of the great Honour and Fame which he had gained by the unexpected Successes of this Campaign, being unwilling to lose the same, so soon as he heard that the Imperial Army was marched towards Transylvania, he resolved to return homewards, and not to tempt Fortune again for this Year, and accord∣ingly marched again with his whole Army to Temeswaer, whence he sent Commands and Decrees one after the other, with Let∣ters to Ziafer the Pasha of Belgrade, to pro∣vide Temeswaer with all sorts of Victuals necessary for maintenance of the Place; and that he should take care to send them thi∣ther, with a Convoy sufficient to defend them from the Enemy: And farther he ordered that Pasha to take notice, That he was returning to his Palace at Adrianople, by the way of Walachia, of which Ad∣vice was given to the Prince, and Com∣mands sent him to repair the Bridges, and mend the Ways of that Country, and to enlarge them for the more easie Passage of the Army:The Sultan Orders for his Return to Adria∣nople. The like Decrees and Com∣mands were sent to the Prince of Moldavia; and divers Letters were Wrote by the Grand Seignior himself to his Mother the Valide Soltana; as also to all the Chief Governors of the Provinces in Anatolia, and to the Chimacams of Constantinople and Adrianople; in which, after he had recount∣ed unto them all his great Actions and Suc∣cesses, he Commanded that Days and Nights of Rejoycings should be celebrated for the same through all the Dominions of his Empire, in regard that he had Taken, and laid Desolate a greater City and Ter∣ritory than that of Belgrade, and that he had slain more than 10000 Germans, and made above 3000 Prisoners, with the Offi∣cers belonging to them; for which Glori∣ous Victories and Fortunes Commands were given to offer Thanksgivings in all Places of the Empire, and to praise God, for that he had been pleased to appease his Wrath against the Musselmen, who had long provoked the Divine Anger. The Sultan being in this manner resolved to make his Return to Adrianople, by way of Walachia, notice was given thereof (as we have said) to the Prince of the Coun∣try, who was thereby put into a most grievous Terrour and Consternation of Mind, not knowing what to do, or how to help and protect his Poor Miserable Province already wasted and consumed by the War; and what was now to be more done on the Passage of divers Asiaticks, Al∣banians, Turks, &c. was not to be resolved; until the Prince considering, and revolving all things in his Mind, concluded, That the best and safest way was, immediately to depart and meet the Sultan on his way, according to his urgent and reiterated Commands; shewing no Fears or Jealousies, but a Confidence of the Grand Seignior's Favour to him: In pursuance of which, he proceeded, and met the Sultan over against Widin; where being seen by him, and looked upon with a tender Eye,The Grand Seignior marches back. and a kind Aspect, the poor Prince began to take Courage, and ease the Throbs of his Trem∣bling Heart. Howsoever being acquaint∣ed with the Humour of the Sultans, who often speak fair to their Pasha's, and yet nourish a secret Design to take away their Lives, he could not settle his Thoughts, or believe that the bitterness of Death was yet over; but there was nothing to be done now, nor any starting back, but on he must go, as he did to the Place called Turno on this side of the Danube, over against Nicopolis, where the Army Encamped on the 13th of October, and the Sultan took some Repose for certain Days, called by the Turks Days of Otoracke, the Officers of the Prince proceeding in the mean time to prepare the Ways, and to make them wider. The Grand Seignior coming very weary to Turno, reposed there about an Hours time, and then Embarking in his own Boat, passed to the other side of the Danube, af∣ter which the Grand Vizier followed with the whole Army, there being Boats and Floats sufficient to Ferry them over. And here it is to be for ever recorded to the ho∣nour of this Sultan Mustapha, That in pas∣sing this Province of Walachia, strict Dis∣cipline was kept, and which was observed with so much Rigour, that a Soldier durst not steal an Egg, a Pullet, or a Hen; and a Tartar was known to be Hanged,The Tur∣kish Disci∣pline. for ta∣king away a Kid by force; and two Asia∣tick Turks were Hanged on a Tree for Rob∣bing a Bee-hive, by which Severity, to the Wonder of the whole World, the Ottoman Army passed that Afflicted Province with∣out the least damage or hurt to the Peo∣ple. And here at this place of Turno, it is to be noted, That before the Grand Seignior passed the River, he called to him the Prince of Walachia, and bestowed upon him a rich Coftan, or Vest, which is a Sig∣nal of the Favour of the Sultan, and told him, That he was greatly pleased and sa∣tisfied with his Service and Diligence, com∣manding him to return Home to his Place of Residence, but above all he charged him to observe Justice, which if he did, he should always enjoy his Favour; the like said the Grand Vizier to him, who giving
him a Vest as an Evidence of his Favour, gave him licence to return to his own place of Government. When the Turks were come on the Con∣fines over against Fetihlam, they Embark∣ed all their Cannon and Ammunition for Belgrade; but the lighter Field-pieces, (of which they found some in Karansebes) they carried with them, to render their Entry into Adrianople, the more Stately and Mag∣nificent. But whilst they were contriving all things for the more Triumpant Entry of the Grand Seignior; it was judged most requisite and proper for the present State of the Turkish Affairs, to make the Triumph into Con∣stantinople, which was ever esteemed the Head of the Empire, and the Place where the Ottoman Throne was ever seated: And as to Adrianople, it was ordered, that the Sultan should make a short stop there of four or five Days only; and in the mean time the Valide Soltana, with all the Fe∣male Court, was ordered to take up their Quarters in the usual Places of the Great Seraglio, which was prepared on all sides to be fitted for Reception of the Grand Seignior. The Grand Seignior marches to Constan∣tinople.This coming of the Grand Seignior to Constantinople, was a suddain Resolution, and unexpected, being the effect of his Thoughts on his March, only for consi∣dering that Constantinople (ever since the Turks entered into Europe) was always e∣steemed the Head and Seat of the Ottoman Empire, and the Place where the Ottoman Emperors were ever Enthroned with the Benediction of the Mufti, assisted by the Nakib, who is Chief of the Emirs, who wear green Tulbants; and also the Place where the Mufti girds the Sword to the Sultan's Thigh, called St. Juob, in Memo∣ry of that Soldier, who was the first that stormed the Walls of Constantinople, when it was in the Possession of the Greeks; for which reason, his Memory hath ever been held in great Veneration with the Turks. The Thoughts whereof incited the Grand Seignior with a sort of Impatience and Am∣bition to imitate the Practice of his Ance∣stors, at a time when he esteemed himself Great, Prosperous, and in a way to reco∣ver the lost Honour and Reputation of the Empire. Moreover, his Design being to be as great at Sea as at Land, or at least of equal Match with the Venetians, or to have a better Army to enter into the Morea, and recover the Country, his Thoughts were fixed upon Constantinople, as the proper Place for that Design; as Adrianople was for the Wars by Land so no time was lost in the March of the Army, to possess the Ancient Seat of the Osmanlees. The Grand Seignior having reposed some few Days (as we have said) at Adrianople, proceeded forwards and arrived in Compa∣ny with his Mother at Constantinople, tho' at first it was appointed otherwise, and that she should go first, and lead the way; but it afterwards seemed more Great and Glo∣rious, and of less Charge to go together, which accordingly they did, and arrived at the Great Seraglio about the latter end of October, or beginning of November: But on the Road the Court and Army happen∣ing to feel some Scarcity and Want of Pro∣visions, the Sultan became very angry and displeased against the Treasurer of the Ar∣my, and against those Officers whose Busi∣ness it was to Oversee the Provisions, and not to suffer any Want to be in Court or Army: Upon which Occasion, the Grand Seignior Discharged the Tefterdar of his Office, with Threats and Menaces of his Life: And the Commissaries for that Busi∣ness being in like manner faulty, as also the second Person under the Tefterdar, was Discharged of his Office, and great care was taken to supply their Offices with Men of Skill and Industry. And now about the beginning of this Month of November,Novemb. The Allai, or Triumph at the En∣trance into Constan∣tinople. the Grand Seignior with all his Court, entered into the Capital City of his Residence, with such Applause and Triumph, and Joy of the People, that the like was never heard or known in the Time of any former Sultan, all which ser∣ved to comfort the People, and encourage the Militia. Amongst the Particulars of this Tri∣umph, 300 Slaves were shown, and all represented for Great Generals and Cap∣tains; for tho' there were but very few Officers amongst them, yet they were gi∣ven out for such, and for German Princes: All the light Cannon, and Field-Pieces, with the Ammunition, Colours, Flags, Drums, and Trumpets, were all showed, and brought into the Account of Spoil; with a Report amongst the Soldiery, That the Turks had not lost above 500 Men, kil∣led in the Field, tho' others of them which came out of the Army, and had been Eye-Witnesses of the whole Battel, and of the Turkish Army, which consisted of 50000 Men, with the Sultan at the Head of them, and yet were hard put to it to fight against 8000 of Veterani's Men; who having maintained a Fight for six Hours, were at length forced to retire for want of Powder and Ammunition, and other Warlike Pro∣visions.
Thus much the Turks, who had been in the Battel, confessed themselves; whilst others who came from all the Countries round to see the Show, and Triumph, Wept for Joy, saying, That the Time was now come, that God would Avenge himself on the Christians, for their Pride; and would for the future blind them in their Designs, and infatuate them in all their Counsels. Howsoever all the World cannot but confess, That the loss of so many Brave Men, could not but prove a fatal Blow to all Christendom, especially to the Germans, who fought almost to the last Drop of Blood: Nor were the Turks unsensible of their Losses also, both as to Numbers and Quality; for one of the Sultan's Brothers-in-Law,Sahin Pa∣sha killed. called Sahin Mehmet Pasha, a brisk daring Man, and a good Soldier, and so Named from Sahin, which signifies a Fal∣con, and was the next to the Grand Vizier, and carried three Horse-Tails gilded before him, was killed by a Carbine-shot; for which reason he was much lamented at the Court, and most especially by the Queen-Mother, not only because he had been her Son-in-Law, but a Person endued with many Rare and Excellent Vertues: Besides which, the famous Mahmud Pasha, Celebrated by all to be one of the most Accomplished Soldiers of this Age, and the most Warlike Cavalier of all the Otto∣man Nation: He was an Albanian Born, a Man of great Reputation and Fame, called Mahmud Bei Oghli, and was slain with three Carbine-shots, and fell amongst the most Renowned Officers of the Turks: These two were said to be the first who broke into Veterani's Army, one to the Right, and the other to the Left-Wing, where they found and encountred such unexpe∣cted Opposition, that the Turks confessed, That they had never met the like, and had not prevailed against their Enemies at that time, had it not been for the Resoluti∣on and Bravery of their Fortunate Sultan, who standing in the Rear with his Scimi∣ter in his Hand, hindered the base intend∣ed Flight of his Soldiery. This Action gave a full stop to all the following Designs of this Year; for the Turks reasoning with themselves, That in case so small an Army as that of Veterani, was able to do such Feats, what would be∣come of their Forces, were they to engage against the whole entire Army of the Kral, that is the Elector; for they call the King of Poland Kral, and so other Inferiour Princes to the Emperor, whom they call Kaisar; but the King of England, they could never be taught to call otherwise than Kral. The Grand Seignior having made his Triumphant Entry into Constantinople, the Militia of Asia which attended the Sultan from the War, had licence given them to return Home to their own Countries, and Orders were given to open a Door, as they call it, to enroll Janisaries, according to the usual Ceremonies used on those Occasions, and care was taken to Arm them, as well the New Janisaries as the Old Veterane Albanian Troops; as also the Levents, or Marine Regiments, and to recruit their Numbers, of which several had been lost in the late Engagements at Sea; the which, tho' they had not for many Years been fought with so much equality of For∣tune between the Venetians and the Turks, as they had been for this Year, yet it was not determined which side had gained the better; tho' the Turks avoided the Fight, so much as was possible, and thereby gave an evidence of their own Weakness, and doubtful Condition. It hath been long since we have heard a∣ny Discourse of Tekely,Tekely neglected. being not regard∣ed so much by any as by the French Am∣bassador; for as to the Turks, they had no Opinion of him, nor would they have it be thought that they had any need of his Forces, or Interest of his Party in Hunga∣ry; but suffered him to Lodge in one of the vilest Streets in the Town, amongst Jews, and the meaner sort of the Arme∣nians, called Balata; his Countenance was much changed, pale, and fallen, and his Feet Swelled, so that his Enemies scorned him, and his Friends could expect nothing more of good from him. The Year drawing now towards an end, all the Endeavours of the Turks were to be∣gin the following Year with greater Forces than that of the preceding; and herein they were the more concerned, in regard of the Moscovites, who were coming down upon the Tartars with vast Numbers of Soldiers, and all things prepared to make War upon them, and to take Asac, at least the Diversion hereby would be great, and so employ the Tartars, that to defend their own Countries, they would be obliged to desert the Service and Cause of the Turks: Howsoever the Successes of the Turks had been this Year so great, as gave them cou∣rage to consider in what manner they might be able to form two Armies for the next; with one of which the chief Design was to enter Transylvania, and if possible, to make Peace with the Moscovites by the Negoti∣ations of the Tartars; but all this came to nothing, as we shall see by the Sequel of the following Year.
Anno 1696. THO' the Turks had gained some ad∣vantage the last Year over the Vene∣tians both by Sea and Land; namely, in the Recovery of Scio, and by giving a Check or Stop to the Venetian Fleet; yet they gained little more thereby, than some little Fame and Reputation to the present Sultan Mustapha, whom the People began to consider, as a Deliverer sent to them from Heaven to recover their almost lost Empire, which lay under sad Distresses as well in Asia as in Europe. This Opinion of the People when they observed the Justice, the Courage, and the Resolution of this Sultan to go in Person to the War, and that nothing could divert him from it, gave them Courage and As∣surance to expect a turn of Fortune, and hopes of better Successes for the future; and tho' the French promised them not to make Peace without them, but to joyn with them in a perpetual League of Friendship; yet the Turks did not much trust them, but kept a watchful Eye over them, know∣ing very well how little stress there is to be laid on the Promises of the Great Mo∣narch of France, who was also equally Jealous of the Faith of the Turks, and both of them equally doubtful of one ano∣ther. This Great Ottoman Empire had the last Year changed both their Master, and the Chief Officers, without any considerable Change, or Troubles in the State amongst themselves, for that this Sultan, in whom clearly appeared a Spirit of greater Wisdom and Courage than in his Father Mahomet IV, or in his Uncle's succeeding him, gave the Soldiery and the People such Hopes and Expectations from him, that none durst open his Mouth, or lift up his Hands a∣gainst him; there appeared also something more of Justice and Vertue in him, and of Diligence, and Care, and Sedulity in his Business, than was found in his Father, or in any of the succeeding Uncles, as we have formerly said; which gave hope to the great Governors of the Empire, that under him the Losses which the Empire had su∣stained in these last Wars, might be repair∣ed; for tho' the Recovery of the Isle of Scio was made before he came to the Throne, and consequently might be looked upon, as an effect of his Uncle's Counsels; for that Mustapha did not enter upon the Government until the end of January 1695, when that Scio had been taken about a Month before by the Turks; but that fal∣ling so near to the time that Mustapha came to the Throne, that piece of good Fortune was looked upon as an effect of the Wis∣dom of the New Emperor, rather than of the Uncle Achmet's Counsel, by which, and by some other Exploits of the preceding Year in 1695, Mustapha grew high in the Opinion of the People, and the Soldiery; to which some Successes being added, as the taking of Titul and Lippa, with the De∣feat given to Veterani; for which the Turks paid very dear, and would not have been cried up for a Victory, had not Victories become very rare in those Days; their Hopes were very big, and that he might make these Actions the more Triumphant and Glorious, the Grand Seignior dispatch∣ed away several Messengers to the Kings of Persia, and the Princes of Arabia, and to other Tributaries, to communicate unto them all his Successes and Victories of the last Year, whereby he hoped to encourage the drooping Spirits of his own Soldiers, and confirm those of his Friends and Al∣lies unto him. The Loss of Scio was certainly not very considerable to the Venetians at that time after they had gained it from the Turks; for Conquests at such a distance from them can never turn to any Account, or bene∣fit. The Morea indeed may be a more useful Conquest, than any of those on the Coast of Asia, where the Turks are far stronger than on the Coast of Europe, and this Year also the Venetians had been most successful in those Parts of the Morea, having Defeat∣ed the Turks there in all their Attempts, in this as well as several other Years; but these Successes are not likely to be conti∣nued, for unless the Venetians increase the Number of their Ships at Sea, and aug∣ment their Forces at Land; and make good choice of their principal Commanders; all Matters will probably go backwards; for such Generals as Morosini and Konismarc are not easily to be found, under whom all things thrived and prospered, so that it were now to be wished, that the Venetian Forces were more numerous than former∣ly, and composed of their own Subjects, rather than of Foreigners. But the Turks had a more watchful Eye over their War in Hungary, and the Parts about Belgrade, and Transylvania, than ei∣ther in Asia, or other Countries of Eu∣rope, or over the Province of Bassora, or Basorat, of which the Arabians had made a late Conquest over the Turkish Basha of that Country, who having but 2000 Men with him, was forced to submit to the
greater force of the Arabs, and upon his Surrender made a Capitulation with them, That he might pass into Persia, where he was well received at Ispahan by the King, being a Wise Man, and a Soldier. About the same time likewise Solyman Bey, a Turk, a Native of Curdistan, having routed a Party of Persians on the Frontiers, had a Commission given him by the Grand Seignior, to do all the Mischief he was a∣ble on the Frontiers of Persia, not on the Persians only, but on the Georgians and Arabians, who had joyned together and made themselves Princes of those Provin∣ces. The Vene∣tians at Sea give a Defeat to the Turks.Nor did the Affairs of the Turks prosper better at that time in the Morea, where a strong Party of the Venetian Forces made an Irruption upon the Turks, and advan∣ced so far as Thebes, where the Turks re∣ceived an entire Defeat, all the Country being Spoiled, Plundered, and Sacked by the Venetians, who upon their return car∣ried with them a great Booty, with vast Numbers of Turkish Slaves. Whilst these Matters were transacting, the Sultan was diligently employed at the Port in forming a Numerous Army, and providing all things for the Support and Maintenance of them. Nor was the like Diligence wanting in preparing and setting forth their Fleet, and putting them into a posture capable to Fight and Engage the Venetians; but as to the Land-Forces, the Campaign of this Year began early in the Month of May, when the Heydukes in di∣vers places of Sclavonia, assembled them∣selves in a Body to the Number of 400 Men, with which they passed the Save, and made an Inroad so far as Nissa, about eight or nine Days to the Eastward of Belgrade, and in that March, they drove away great Numbers of small and great Cattle; after which they contrived in what manner to make their Retreat; but as they thought thereupon, the Garrisons of Belgrade, and other Neighbouring Places, made a Sally out upon them with a Party of about 2000 Men, Horse and Foot, who being in∣formed of the Enemies Design, they drew up so advantagiously in a Wood, and re∣ceived them with so great Bravery, that after several Repulses given them, in which great Numbers were Killed and Wounded, were at length forced to fly and quit the Field, whilst the Sclavonians made good their Retreat, and proceeded happily in their Design, which is all the Prologue that was made to the succeeding Actions of the following Campaign; only every thing began then to dispose it self towards a Bloody War, and for Action of the follow∣ing Year: When the Duke of Lorain made his first Campaign in Hungary in Quality of Major-General of the Imperial-Army, Commanding in particular the Regiments of St. Croix, de Commerci, and Bassompierre, in which Commands this Young Prince e∣videnced to the World, a clear Inclination, and Disposition to the War, agreeable to the Mind of his Illustrious Ancestors. Whilst things were thus preparing in Hungary, News came to the Port from Di∣arbekir, giving the Relation of a Fight be∣tween the Rebels in those Parts, and the Turks, in which the Turks had been De∣feated, and their General,The Pasha of Diarbe∣kir put to Flight. the Pasha of Di∣arbekir, put to Flight, at a Place not far from Sivas: The Particulars of which suc∣ceeded in this manner. When the Pasha heard where the Rebels were Encamped, he presently marched a∣gainst them with a Body of 3600 Horse, Commanding two other Pashas with a force of 2000 Horse more to fall upon the Re∣bels, and getting between them began to Kill and Destroy them without giving Quarter to any of them: The Rebels ha∣ving had timely notice of this Motion of the Pasha's, they mounted their Horses with much Courage and Activity, towards the Evening, and taking a Round about the Mountain, by favour of the Moon, they marched all that Night, and in the Morning early they fell in with the Turkish Seraskier, or General, with their Swords,And the Turks de∣feated. or Scimyters, and with their Pikes and Lances, whence arose a very Bloody Fight, which held for the space of two Hours, to the great loss and diminution of the Army of the Turks, and danger of the Pasha's Life, who being put into great fear quit∣ted the Field and fled, leaving the Spoil to the Enemy; with which they being en∣couraged, they marched towards Aleppo, and from thence exacted what Money and Provisions that rich Province could afford them, upon pain of Military Execution; at which the Sultan was so enraged, that he gave out present Orders to raise the Ne∣firan, which is the Militia of the Eastern Countries; and like one Man to rise and joyn themselves against the Enemy. Be∣sides which, many other things were to be done, both by Sea and Land, and that with all Expedition, in regard that the force of the Rebels growing daily greater, their Power would with much more diffi∣culty be subdued. And in regard there was a necessity of putting the Fleet to Sea with all expediti∣on, all other Affairs were laid aside, until that was dispatched, which was performed
after the Biram, and then about the be∣ginning of May the Sultan began his March towards Hungary at the Head of his Army, when several were of Opinion that due care should be taken to suppress the Re∣bels in Asia; but the Sultan would hear of nothing more than to raise the Nefiran of the Country upon them, which are a sort of Soldiers like our Trained-Bands, and not better exercised in the Wars. The Sultan who intended to have brought this Year 80 or 100000 Men in∣to the Field against the Emperor, was con∣tented to fall short at least 10000 Men of that Number which he had the last Year: And in regard the Asiatick Soldiers could not, or would not leave their own Coun∣try to attend the Armies in Hungary; the whole Army of the Turks did not amount to more than 50000 Men; and scarcely to that neither considering the Diversions made on one side by the Persians, and by the Muscovites on the other; wherefore considering these Difficulties and Distresses, all the Ottoracks were called to the Wars, being in the Nature of Milites immeriti, who after their long Services in the War, have liberty given them to withdraw to their own Homes, with two Pence or three Pence a Day, which is called a dead Pay; and of these there may be about 40000 Men, which may be some Addition to the Number of the Turkish Army, and with these the Turks were now obliged to help themselves. But to understand more distinctly the Transactions and Progress of all the Turkish Affairs both by Sea and Land for this Year following, In the first place we are to take notice, That in the Month of March of this Year,The Grand Seignior, with the Queen Mo∣ther leaves Constan∣tinople. 30 Frigats were dispatched for Asac, which soon afterwards were followed by eight Gallies. As to the Land Matters, March the 28th the Grand Seignior and Grand Vizier made their Alloy to their Tents, which were pitched as usual at Daout Pasha; but that being very early in the Morning, the Show was but indifferent. The Grand Seignior was dressed in the manner, as when he made his Entrance. The Valide followed about two Hours after, with great Atten∣dance. April.Mezzo Morto the Admiral, having left the Bastarda Gally behind him, sailed out of Port the 6th of April; and the Grand Seignior and Grand Vizier marched for Adrianople, where they arrived the 17th of this Month. The 23d of this April being the Day of the Great Biram, News was brought of the Birth of a Daughter Born to the Sultan in the Seraglio, whereupon the Chimacam, to show his Respect and Duty to the Grand Seignior, caused four Days of Rejoycing to be proclaimed;A Fire at Constan∣tinople. but on the 24th Day a lit∣tle after Midnight, there happening a very great Fire, the Rejoycings were forbidden and recalled. The Fire began without the Gate of To∣phana, the Wind at N. E. which being ve∣ry fierce and strong, soon reduced all that Quarter into Ashes, where it continued burning till Five in the Afternoon of the 25th; during which time 3000 Houses were computed to have been Burnt, and amongst them all our Merchant's Houses, excepting one who had the good Fortune to be saved: But God be praised not much of our English Goods were burnt. About the beginning of June of this Year,June. the Marquis de Lore arrived at Constantino∣ple, in Quality of Ambassador Extraordi∣nary from the French King: He was brought as far as Tenedos by a French Man of War of 60 Guns, and from thence by a Tartan he was Transported to Constantinople, from whence, on the 12th of this Month he was carried to Adrianople, and thence with∣out loss of time he followed the Camp, which had marched thence the eighth of June. The 23d of this Month, Tekely was Commanded by the Grand Seignior, to follow the Camp, but his Princess remain∣ed at Constantinople, both of them being in great Necessity to live, being only allowed five Dollars a Day, besides some small mat∣ter arising from the Imposts of Wine, which the Grand Seignior permitted them to bring in. The Beauty of this Lady could prevail little either for her self or Prince; for I have heard, That she was a Lady of a very hard Countenance, and her Air, and Carriage, in no wise engag∣ing. The Turkish Army being arrived at Bel∣grade,July. they began to move on the 30th of July, and that Day to pass the Danube, when publick Prayers were begun at Con∣stantinople and Adrianople for their Succes∣ses and Blessings of their Army, which was this Year esteemed very powerful, and designed (as the common Report was) against Transylvania: But whilst the Turks marched full of hopes of Success, with a great Army supposed to consist of 100000 Men; their Boldness was much tempered by the News of the Surrender of Asac to the Muscovites after 57 Days Siege, and the Advices wanting 16 Days, it was said, That the Tartar Han arrived two Days af∣ter the Surrender, tho' had he come sooner,
he could have done nothing; for it was so closely Besieged, that the Turks themselves were of Opinion, That all the Succours sent thence, namely, from all parts of the Turkish Dominions, would not have been able to effect any thing: Neither were the Gallies, which were with five more than the 13 sent the last Month, able to ap∣proach the Place by some Leagues: Here∣upon the Corn at Constantinople, was risen 50 per Cent. and the People were so ap∣prehensive of a Famine in all the Domini∣ons of the Turks, that in case the Musco∣vites should make any Progress, they should not know which way to proceed. At that time Mezzo Morto with the Tur∣kish Fleet was still at Scio, intending about the middle of this Month to Sail from thence; he had with him about 40 Sail of Ships besides Gallies; the Venetians were not very strong, nor did either side endea∣vour to engage. But the most important Design of this Summers Campaign, was laid in Hungary and Transylvania, where the Sultan fixed his greatest hopes, and both Sides intend∣ed to do their best, and to bring things to a decisive Action; to perform which, His Electoral Highness of Saxony having fixed the Imperial Camp at a Place called Olasch, on the 30th of August N. S. giving out, as if the Design was to Besiege Temeswaer, and thereby to draw the Enemy into a Ne∣cessity of Sallying out, and coming to a Battle, that they might be better able to relieve the Place; to which end the Turks having passed the Danube, the nearer to ap∣proach their Enemies, made two Days March, one after the other; by which being four Leagues distant from each other. On the 20th of this Month they held a Council of War, at which it was resolved to advance one Day nearer to observe the Countenance of the Enemy. So that very early in the Morning on the 21st, they marched in good Order of Bat∣tel, and by nine a Clock they discovered some of the Enemies Cavalry, whom they Attacked and Repulsed several times with considerable loss to the Turks. And on the 22d some Parties of the Christians brought several Prisoners into the Camp, amongst which was a Chiaus, who reported, That the Janisaries were very ad∣vantageously posted on the right side of a Morass, confined, and reaching to the Banks of the River Temes, and another Body of them Encamped to the Left along the Banks of the Brook Begl, their Can∣non being pointed upon that Place, where was the only Avenue, or Access where the Enemy could come upon them; and their Camp on all sides so fortified; that the Christians could not Attack them without much Difficulty and Danger; wherefore, to give the Enemy room to advance, and invite them to a Battle, the Turks on the 24th Sallied out from their Retrench∣ments, which was done only with Design to make other Lines, which were finish∣ed in two Hours time, or less; and ha∣ving there planted their Cannon, they be∣gan to play one upon the other on both sides, and as the Prisoners who had been made in several Skirmishes, assured the Christian Army their Artillery was well served, and had killed many of their Soldi∣ers, and several of their best Gunners, tho' the loss on the Christian side had been but very indifferent. On the 25th nothing very considerable was acted: But On the 26th the Christians advanced Guards acquainted the Generals, That the Body of the Enemies Army was in moti∣on, and marched in posture of Battle, un∣der Covert of Bushes, Shrubs, and some Trees, and that they had already posted themselves between Temeswaer and the Christian Army, the Generals of which sending to take a view of the Countenance of the Enemy; they were of Opinion, and saw evidently, that the Body which they discovered, consisted of the whole Turkish Army, and not a Detachment; upon which the Christian Army marched directly upon them to Attack and Engage them; but be∣fore they could come so near as to Engage them, they had covered and fortified them∣selves under the Bushes and Ditches, that it was difficult to come at them; and ha∣ving also a Bog behind them, and a Marsh on their left Hand, with three Ranks of Waggons fastned to each other with Chains of Iron in the Front, made the Attack al∣most impossible to be made. Howsoever the Generals resolved, whatsoever Diffi∣culties might offer, to Attack the Enemy;The Battle of Olasch. and accordingly about five a Clock in the Evening, six Battalions of Foot, sustain∣ed by two Regiments of Dragoons, Char∣ged the Enemy in the Flank under the Command of General Heusler, and com∣manded them to march into the Wood, which they performed with great Bravery, and much galled the Turks with their Fire. The Enemies Horse hereupon advanced, and finding that the Christians had formed their Line, charged them with great Fury, when 1200 of their best Horse broke through the two Saxon Battalions, not∣withstanding the latter made a very brave Resistance; but Lieutenant-General Zui∣zendorf,
with some Regiments of Horse of the same Line, beat back the Enemy, and again closed the Line with some Saxon Bat∣talions, and Attacked the Janisaries in their Intrenchments, and beat them from their Post; but the Enemies Foot being reinfor∣ced, and their Horse taking our Men in the Flank, they were obliged to retire; on∣ly two Regiments of our Dragoons, Com∣manded by the Young Prince of Vaude∣mont, advanced to sustain them, and repul∣sed the Turkish Horse; but the Janisaries returning, and Charging them again, the Dragoons suffered very much by their Fire, and many Soldiers and Officers were kil∣led and wounded; but General Heusler bringing up another Regiment to their As∣sistance, beat back the Enemy to their In∣trenchments, but was himself dangerously wounded. Whilst this was doing, another Body of the Enemies Horse Charged another Body on the second Line, where the Christian Troops received them in such a manner, as gave a Check to their Fury, and then Ge∣neral Roses advancing with the Horse of the same Line, drove them back, and pursued them about two Hungarian Miles, when the Victory began to declare it self in fa∣vour of the Christians, and the Turks to put themselves into Flight, when Orders came to General Roses to stop the Pursuit, and to march back with the Troops; howsoever some other Squadrons of Horse followed the Enemies unto their Intrenchments; from whence the Turks made so great a Fire both with their Cannon and Small-shot, that those Squadrons were forced to retire; and being pursued by the Enemies Horse, they encountred another of the Christian Regiments, which they also put into Dis∣order; which General Roses observing, ad∣vanced with the Regiment of Caprara, and Charging the Enemy in the Flank, cut off above 1000 of them: Then the whole Christian Line advanced, and pushed the Enemy into their Trenches, where they were in such a Consternation, that the Sultan himself with much difficulty pre∣vailed upon them to keep their Ground, and defend their Intrenchments, killing se∣veral with his own Hand,The Turks worsted. that would have fled; and at length Night coming on, it put an end to the Battle. Thus the Christians remaining Masters of the Field, or Place of Battle, intended to Attack again the Enemies Camp by Break of Day in the Morning; but they laboured so hard all that Night, that they fortified their Camp, and made it almost impregnable; which hindered the Germans from making another Attempt in the Morning. The Christians lost a great many Men in this Fight, amongst which were divers Of∣ficers of Fame and Renown, as Heusler, General of the Horse, and Major-General Polland, besides others who died of their Wounds. The Turks lost above 8000 Men, as was reported by a Pasha, who was taken Pri∣soner in the Battel. The Troops on both sides often min∣gled, and gave no Quarter on either side. A great Booty was taken from the Turks, amongst which were many fine Horses, with several Standards. In the heat of this Action the Germans lost some Pieces of Cannon, by reason that their Carriages were shot in pieces and the Horses which drew them were killed. The 27th of this Month of September,Septemb. 27, and 28. the whole Christian Army remained that whole Day in Posture of Battle before their Camp; but the Enemy not appearing, His Electoral Highness resolved to pass the Beque, and to march towards the River Theysse, to supply the Army with Provisions, of which they began to be in want, which was done the 28th when the Turks passed the River in like manner. And on the 29th the Christian Army En∣camped at Olasch, near the Theysse, where General Staremberg joyned the rest of the Army with six Regiments of Horse from Titul; and Orders were sent to the Bran∣denburghers, and other Troops, that were not in the Battle, having been posted in several Flying Camps, to joyn the Army, which being refreshed, were ordered to march again to observe the Enemy in their Motion. This is the Account which the Turks themselves give of this Battle, which be∣ing finished, as here described, both Ar∣mies thought it now to be the Time and Season to withdraw out of the Field; and so the Elector withdrew out of the Field, and came to Vienna; by which it was judg∣ed, that no farther Action would happen for that Year; and in confirmation thereof, the Turkish Fleet retired into Salankement, without having done any thing of moment for this whole Year: It is not to be doubt∣ed, but that the Issue of this Battel turned to the Advantage of the Imperialists, un∣less it be that they left 26 Pieces of Can∣non in the Bushes. The Season of the Year declining now towards the Winter, and the Elector of Saxony withdrawn from the Field to Vienna, the Sultan also following the like Example, (which displeased not the Turkish Army) returned from Belgrade to Adrianople, on
the 17th of the last Month of October, where being arrived,October. they did not much brag or boast of their Success, tho' to speak truly, they had this Year withstood a greater Force of the Christians, than they had for several Years before, which they attribute in a great measure, to the Perso∣nal Valour and Bravery of the Sultan him∣self, whose Presence ever gives Courage to his Army: And it is said, That he kept all the time of the Battle in the Rear, with 3000 Choice Men, to kill all Persons whom he should find or meet turning their Backs, upon whom he did some Execu∣tion. In all these Actions, both in this and se∣veral other Years, the French did great Services to the Turks,The French do great Services. both by their Coun∣sels, and Management of their Affairs, and especially the Marquis de Lore was very Eminent, and Signal in all his Behaviour; tho' there was never any good Understand∣ing between him and the Ambassador Mon∣sieur Chaterneau. This Year was not very signal on either side for any considerable Exploits at Sea, or on the Watry Element: Only that the Turks destroyed three of the Emperor's Vessels, or Gallies on the Danube, and took one of very good force. After which all things remained quiet as to the Camp in Hungary and elsewhere, except the great Preparations which were making for the re-taking of Asac from the Moscovites; from whence five Gallies were about this time returned, having left eight others with the Brigantines at Ozul. On the first Day of November an Am∣bassador from Persia made his Entrance in∣to Constantinople, where a great Ship four Days after was Launched, carrying 100 Guns, four whereof would shoot a Shot of 24 Okes, every Oke weighing two Pounds and a half, with design to be fitted for the Service of the following Year, with three others, which were built in the Black-Sea, much of the same bigness and sized with that which was built at Constanti∣nople, and now Launched for Entertainment of the Persian Ambassador, who staid not long in that City before he proceeded to Adrianople, where he arrived about the 20th of November with a Retinue of about 150 Attendants,Novemb. besides those which were appointed to serve him by the Turks, whose Entrance was in this manner. The Manner of the Persian Ambas∣sador's Entrance. About an Hours distance from the City, at a Place called Solak Chisme, the Ambas∣sador was met by the Chiaus-Basha, with about 60 of his Chiauses, as also by the Lieutenant-General of the Spahees, who with a great Retinue, conducted him to his Lodgings in the Palace of the Treasu∣rer Achmet Pasha, who had Orders to assign him 250 or 300 Dollars a Day for his En∣tertainment, for the Subsistence of him and his Retinue: Besides which allowance was given for the Food of an Elephant, and for Fodder for Camels and Horses; and also a 100 weight of Sugar a Day for Sweetmeats for the Persians, who are great lovers of that kind of Diet, with Amber and Per∣fumes. The Ambassador having remained about 12 Days at Adrianople, and there well en∣tertained, he demanded Audience of the Grand Vizier, to whom he delivered the Credentials from the King his Master; and having been entertain'd in Discourse for about the space of three Quarters of an Hour, he departed from the Grand Vizier, having only received one single Vest, which seemed very strange, in regard it had been the Custom for other Ambassadors from Persia to receive 60, at least disposed be∣tween them and their Retinue. Upon the 16th of December;Audience of the Per∣sian Am∣bassador. the Ambas∣sador received his Audience from the Grand Seignior, on a Tuesday, which is the usual Day of the Divan, when it was formerly the Custom to give out the Pay to the Jani∣saries and Soldiers; at which time also there being an Appearance of the Chief Officers both Civil and Military, renders all things the more stately, and magnificent: But it seems at this time contrary to all former Customs, the Pay was not given out to the Janisaries and Soldiers, because per∣haps that the principal Officers of the Ar∣my were at Belgrade, and upon the Fron∣tiers of Hungary: Howsoever as great an Appearance there was of the Chiauses, as had been the Custom at the Audiences gi∣ven to other Ambassadors. And then the Presents were sent unto the Grand Seignior, which consisted of
The Presents from Persia. A Female Elephant covered with a Fur∣niture of Cloth of Gold, which came down to the Foot; and on the place of the Sad∣dle, there was a Chair of State erected, lined within with thin Silver Plates. Besides which, were six Camels, each of which carried two Sapets, or Hampers used in the Wars, in which were contained the Royal Presents made up in little Bales with Coverings of Silk. Moreover there were Ten Camels laden with Persian Hangings, six of which were of fine Silks, and four ordinary ones, but very large, and of a more than usual size: As also three Camels laden also with Cloth of Gold. Upon the Ambassador's Arrival at the Grand Seignior's Seraglio, the Janisaries were presented as running for their Por∣ridge, and Pilao, or Rice, being about Noon, which was their Dinner time, as was their Daily Practice, as was shown to all Ambassadors. The Place reserved for the Ambassador, was the same as was prepared for others, just over against the Grand Vizier, that the manner how that Great Minister di∣stributes Justice to the People, might more plainly appear. The Supream Vizier sate at the same Table with the Ambassador; six of whose Gentlemen were placed at the Table with the Chimacam Chassan Pasha, and six others at the Table with the Aga, or General of the Janisaries: And in regard the Compa∣nions of the Ambassador consisted of more than 40 Noble Men, the Turks were obli∣ged to place them at three other Tables; leaving out the Pasha's of the Bench, and other Officers; so that it happened out that Day, that no Place was left for the Kadileschers, or Lords Chief Justices, all being taken up for the Persians. At this time the Royal Presents contain∣ed in the 12 Chests which had been car∣ried upon the six Camels, were taken out, and carried by the Hands of 150 Men, as the Custom of the Turks was: The which consisted of Cloth of Gold, Damasks, Sa∣bles, Boxes of Musk and Amber, Silks, and Sattins of various Colours, Turbants, Hangings of Silk, ordinary Damasks, Bezoar-stones, Persian and Indian Sattins, Bridles of Gold, a Topus or Mace of Gold, with a Sword of the like Metal: After all which Ceremonies, according to the Ancient Custom, the Persian Ambassador being upon his Return from the Presence of the Sultan, he introduced 20 of his Persian Nobles, and then he delivered the Royal Letter. The which Ceremony be∣ing over, he proceeded out from the Roy∣al Presence Cloathed in a Rich Vest, like unto that which he had received at his Au∣dience with the Great Vizier, which was like to that which they had usually given in former times to Christian Ambassadors; besides which, the Grand Seignior present∣ed him with the same Horse which was sent him to carry him to his Audience with the Sultan, and Vested 90 Gentlemen of his Retinue. After which he returned to his Lodgings which had been provided for him and with the same Attendance as had accompanied him to his Audience. After some Days continuance at the Ot∣toman Court, it was made known by some of the Principal Ministers of State, that one part of the Substance of the Letter was, after the Salutes and kind Wishes, and Con∣gratulations at his Ascension to the Sublime Throne of his Ancestors, The King of Per∣sia made the following Request to the Grand Seignior: The King of Persia's Requests and Demands. The First Article demanded. THAT he would be pleased, if it were possible, to Remove Bebek Suliman Bei from the Government of Caramania, and to put another Prince into his place, who might prove of a more Quiet and Placid Di∣sposition than this Bebek, who was of a Tur∣bulent Spirit, and gave much Molestation to the Persians; the which the King of Persia, or Sofi, did not doubt but to obtain from that Friendship which intervenes between their great Powers and Dominions. And whereas Yearly many Persian Pilgrims travel to Mec∣ca, where having no Place to Pray in, and make their Devotions separately and apart from other Nations, they found themselves much hindered, and incommoded in the Ex∣ercise of their Mahometan Devotions; where∣fore their Desire was, That they might have a Place assigned them for the Use of the Per∣sians.
The Second Article demanded. Farther it was desired, That the prehe∣minence of Place and Superiority in the Holy Land, might be given to the Armenian Pa∣triarch, before others of the Christian Rite, who were Subjects to the King of Persia; the which ought not to be refused them, in regard that they profess the same Faith with o∣ther Christians; namely, Greeks, and Franks. But in regard that it hath never been the Custom of the Turks to return a spee∣dy Answer to fair Promises, or Flattering Insinuations, a term of 25 Days passed be∣fore an Answer was returned to the prece∣ding Demands; and that was done when the Ambassador received Audience with the Chimacam: And then he was Invited with all his Court and Attendance, to an Entertainment with the Grand Vizier, where they met about two a Clock in the Afternoon, the Feast held until five a Clock, and concluded without other Presents than good Musick, unless it were of a stately Horse, with an agreeable Furniture. Some Days afterwards, he was Invited to Dinner by the Chimacam Hassan Pasha, and in a Week afterwards, he was in like manner treated by the Aga, or General of the Janisaries, who also presented the Am∣bassador with a very fine Horse. After all which Feasts, and Bankets, and Presents, the Ambassador thought it time to send his Presents to the Grand Vizier, by his Kahya, and other Principal Officers of his Court, in number about 40. The Persian Presents to the Turks. There were six Camels, two of which were laden with Presents, and the other four with fine Tents and Furniture for the same, with rich Garments: The Presents were all carried by the Hands of 28 Persi∣ans; that is to say, with Cloth of Gold, Damasks, Indian Sattins, Persian Tur∣bants, with a rich Sword. Moreover two small Bails to the Vizi∣er's Kahya, which contained about 25 Pie∣ces of Sattins, Damasks, and Cloth of Gold. In like manner the Presents to the Chi∣macam Chavan Pasha, contained about 40 Pieces. And that which was for the Jani∣sar-Aga, was not much inferiour to it. After some Days stay, a Messenger was sent from the Grand Seignior, with the Answer to the Letter of Business which the Persian Ambassador had brought: Which was in this manner. The Grand Seignior's Answer, to the Persian Ambassador. THAT Solyman Bebek being an Inhe∣ritary Prince, could not be removed from his Government; it being against the Mahometan Law to be removed from thence; nor was it possible for them to Allow, or Assign any separate Place to the Persians to Pray, and Exercise their Devotions in, because that Mecca is a Holy Place, and free, and com∣mon to all Mahometans. The Holy Land hath also been Assigned to the Standard-Bearer Omer, as also to the Franks; the which having not been much E∣steemed, or set by in the Time of Mustapha Pasha Vizier, the Preheminence of that Place was given as a Law to the Franks, which was so solemnly given, that it could not be taken away, Corrupted, or Violated. Five or six Days afterwards the Ambas∣sador went to the Vizier to take his Let∣ter, which being delivered to him,The Persi∣ans depart. about three or four Days afterwards the Vizier sent him, by Order of the Grand Seignior, 50 Bags, or Purses of Money, by the Chiaus-Basha; ten Days after which, he departed from Adrianople, and went to Constantinople, taking 60 Days Journey within the Dominion of the Ottomans, ac∣counting Tocat in Mesopotamia, and other Parts; the which was so divided, that a Persian Merchant coming to die within that Dominion, his Goods may be challenged by his Relations, and conveyed away to their Inheritance. The Persian Ambassador had still another Request to make, in respect to his Na∣tion. That the Persian Subjects who Inhabit at Balata in Constantinople; wanting a Place for their Devotions, may have that Place re∣stored to them for their Prayers, which was formerly belonging to the Armenians. The which Request was granted to them before the Departure of the Ambassador,
with Power to rebuild the same again in what should be wanting; the which was taken away soon after the Departure of the Persian Ambassador from Constantinople. And tho' the Armenian Commissary endea∣voured to proceed, and made his Com∣plaints at Adrianople, against the Impedi∣ments he had found; yet no Remedy was found, but an end was put to all the Work, and the Workmen desisted from all other Proceedings in that Building. And here it may be enquired, How it came to pass that so many Embassies were sent from Persia to the Turks successively, one after the other? The Cause of which is evident from the Succession of the Three Sultans one after the other; namely, So∣lyman, Achmet, and Mustapha, who now Reigns; to every one of which, as it is the constant Custom for the Persians to send an Ambassador; so on the other side, on the same Occasion, it is for the Turks to send unto the Persians. Septemb.Towards the end of this Month, the Elector of Saxony returned to Vienna, which was an evident Demonstration, that there would be no farther Action in Hungary for this Year; and at the same time the Tur∣kish Fleet retired to a Bay near Salanke∣ment, without having done any great Da∣mage. The Persians, as we have said, being departed, and on their way homewards; the Sultan considered in what manner he might most conveniently and readily pay his Army both of Horse and Foot; for which important Service Money did not readily offer; wherefore to supply that Want, the Grand Seignior sent for the Tef∣terdar, or Treasurer, to come to his Pre∣sence, but he not being able to appear with ready Money in Hand, the Tefterdar could scarce make a shift to save his Head; tho' with great labour and difficulty he sa∣tisfied the Spahee's, charging them to re∣turn timely at the beginning of the next Year, to follow him to the Wars: And in the mean time Commissaries were sent from all Parts to collect and gather all the Taxes which had been laid on the People in all parts, whether in Europe or Asia, within the Ottoman Empire, as likewise what Re∣venue was arising to the Grand Seignior from Offices, Customs, Taxes, &c. which are usually sold every Month, especially in the Month of March over all the Empire, which commonly brings in several Milli∣ons: So that the Tefterdar, or Treasurer, was forced to employ Spies to advise him where the Money was, and in whose Cof∣fers, which yielded great Sums for supply of the Grand Seignior's Occasions. These things being over, great Prepa∣rations were making for the following Campaign, both by Sea and Land; seve∣ral half Gallies were already built for the Black-Sea, Commanded by Dervish Ogli Bei of Smyrna. The Fleet under the Com∣mand of Mezzo Morto, who was Captain-Pasha, consisted of 25 Sail of Men of War, all of them being the Grand Seigni∣or's own Ships, and such as being joyned with those of Barbary, would be too strong a Match for the Venetians. This whole Winter the Grand Seignior passed at Adrianople, where after the Ex∣ample of his Father, he delighted much in Hunting. Howsoever as the Year came on, he neglected not the thoughts of War, nor the Preparations for the ensuing Year; but as yet the Scheme for the War was not designed nor laid. Anno 1697. THE Embroils in Asia with the begin∣ning of this Year seemed to be a little quieted, gave hopes to the Turks,  that Basora would shortly be restored to them. 'Twas thought at this time, that the Marquis de Lore making little or no show at Adrianople, being then in Quality of Envoy Extraordinary, would follow the Camp for the ensuing Campaign; but as to the Ambassador Castelneuf, he resolved to remain at Adrianople, acting for the Af∣fairs of their King and Nation, between whom and the Marquis appeared no good understanding. The Friendship still continued, and seemed to increase between the French and the Turks, till the latter began to be some∣thing doubtful of them, upon the Reports and Rumours which flew about, That the French were busied in making a General Peace with all the Allies; tho' they at first confidently denied it to the Turks, who notwithstanding grew Jealous of them; and from that time their Mutual Friendship began much to abate. The Tumults in Asia still continued; to quiet which, and to carry on the War in Hungary, the Turks prepared to enter into Transylvania, to which end they daily Listed and Enrolled New Spahee's and Ja∣nisaries in all the Provinces of Asia, issuing forth very rigorous Orders, That the Mi∣litia in all those Parts should this Year ap∣pear early in the Field; and greater Prepa∣rations were making for this Year, than for a long time before, by reason that the
Sultan out of his Glory and Pride, resol∣ved to make his utmost Effort this Year on Hungary, and Transylvania, and according∣ly to win all back again, and if not to put an end to the War, to come to an Honour∣able Accommodation of Peace, which the Turks were sensible could not be avoided, in case they should receive any Blow, or suddain Foyl the next Year from the Chri∣stians. This the Ambassadors of England and Holland so plainly foresaw, that they lay upon the watch to observe all the Inclinati∣ons and Motions of the Turks; and both sides now esteeming themselves upon the Crisis, laboured all that was possible to bring things to their desired Issue; when daily Spahees and Commissaries were em∣ployed to gather and collect Sums of Mo∣ney in all the Asiatick Provinces, were ob∣served to pass the Bosphorus, and other Seas, for Service of the War; of which the Tar∣tars being informed, wrote to the Sultan to send them Money to supply their Occa∣sions against the Moscovites, of whom they were more affraid than of the Polanders. Howsoever the Turks being Headed by so Brave a Sultan as this present Grand Seig∣nior, as they thought, did not seem to fear any thing, but to carry all before them, which so elevated them to such a heighth of Pride and Insolence, that the Mediators were of an Opinion, That until a conside∣rable Blow were given to the Turks,Preparati∣ons for the Turkish Fleet. it would be impossible to reduce them to any Terms of Reason and Moderation. In which Humour they made Preparati∣ons for the following Year both by Sea and Land: That for the Sea designed for the Euxine, was chiefly provided at a Port called Sinap, in the Country of Trabesonda, where they also were casting many great and heavy Cannon: And into the Arsenal of Constantinople, were in this Month of January 120 Cannon more brought in and lodged there. But what other Sultans have not done, this hath had the Ambition to perform; that is, under his own Name all the Pieces of Gold and Silver should pass, within his Empire; the like of which was never known in any other Country, unless in England under the Reign of King Wil∣liam III, and the Great. I cannot say that all the Gold and Silver within the Turkish Dominions was brought into the Mint to be new Coined, but it is certainly reported, that a great part thereof was; to which the five Sol Pieces made by the French, Ita∣lians,Alteration of the Coyn in Turky. and other Nations, greatly helped and contributed, of which there had been many Millions Imported in 15 Years, from 65 to 80, which were very beneficial to the Coynage of those Countries. It was also farther commanded, That all those who had any Venetian Zechins, should bring them to the Mint, there to be new stamped with the Letters of this Sultan's Name, and there to be changed with the old ones of Venice, or otherwise changed for Silver, at the rate of two Dollars and a half per Zechin: Likewise all the Lin Dollars, commonly imported by the Dutch with the Figure of a Lion thereupon, were order'd to be brought into the Exchequer, where the Figure of the Lion being beaten out with the Hammer, the Turkish Impres∣sion with the Name of the Sultan, was to be fixed in the place thereof: To bear the Charges of this new Coyning, a quarter of a Dram of Silver was taken from every Lion-Dollar, and then it was put into the Fire, where it was Hammered again, and some Cbristian Letters on the side thereof were permitted to remain, that thereby it might appear, that the same were reformed Dollars, and such as came from the Chri∣stians; and that for the Alterations thereof, the Turkish Workmen were not to be bla∣med; for which Work the Turks, Grecians, Armenians, and Jewish Workmen, had so much allowed them by the Day, according to their Agreement. About this time, being the Month of Fe∣bruary, Advices were brought frequently to the Sultan then at Adrianople, from the Tartars, That the Moscovites were fully resolved this Year to fall down by Sea up∣on Caffa; which being believed, and so expected, very strict and severe Orders were given by the Turks, to provide and equip 80 Frigats, with 15 Gallies, and many other Transport-Ships, to carry the Militia into the Black-Sea, to hinder the Descent, or Landing of the Moscovites; which Report gave great Fears and Ap∣prehensions to the Turks, who thereupon took different Resolutions and Measures in their Affairs. Besides the Preparations for the Black-Sea, there were others made for the Euxine, or White-Sea, where Mezzo Morto was ap∣pointed Captain-Pasha, or General against the Venetians, being accounted a Man of great Courage, and Conduct, at which time there was building a Ship of an im∣mense bigness,Maritime Preparati∣ons for the Year 1697. which had been already many Months upon the Stocks, being built by French and Greek Masters, the like of which, that is so large, had never been built in that Arsenal; for it could carry more than 600 Soldiers, besides Seamen, and Levents; the which being put into some tolerable condition of readiness to
Sail, the Sultan to show his Greatness at Sea, as well as at Land, to the Persian Ambassador, (who remained behind, after the great Embassy) issued out his Com∣mands to three Pasha's, whom he had made Generals, to equip and fit themselves brave∣ly. The first was Mezzo Morto, who was to Engage the Venetian Fleet at Sea, and to return Victorious; and in case they did, he assured them, that they should gain his singular Grace and Favour; and as an evi∣dence thereof, he bestowed upon each of them a very rich Coftan, or Vest, richly lined with Sables. The Second was also a Pasha Vice-Ad∣miral, designed against the Moscovites. The third was also a Pasha, in Quality of a Rear-Admiral, who was to mount the Danube, and engage against the Imperial Fleet, wheresoever they should encounter them, either about Belgrade, or Buda, or any other Parts of the Danube. After the Sultan had passed this Cere∣mony, he gave leave to his Generals to depart, and speaking very kindly and gra∣ciously to them, he encouraged them to put themselves in order for their Respe∣ctive Voyages: So that now it was very apparent, that tho' the Turks would be much weaker this Year by Land, than they were the last, yet they would be far stron∣ger by Sea, having Mezzo Morto for their Admiral, and every thing in their feveral Fleets disposed for Maritime and Naval Engagements; the Success of which, we may shortly hear in the course of those Months which are proper for Actions of the Sea. But before we proceed so far, it may be pertinent to our Business to recount how the French Ambassador at the Turkish Court lost a Law-Suit which he had with a certain Jew at Gran Cairo, to his great Mortifica∣tion; for supposing that he was able to a∣vail in all Points, where his Master's Inte∣rest was concerned; he was highly trou∣bled to find himself disappointed in a Busi∣ness at Gran Cairo, relating to so inconsi∣derable a Person as a Jew. The Matter was in this manner. We must know, that the Jews in Egypt have commonly very great Power, by rea∣son that every Pasha of Gran Cairo, who is the greatest Beglerbey in all the Empire, when he enters upon that Office, he com∣monly takes with him from Constantinople, some Subtle Jew,A Story of the Consul and a Jew at Gran Cairo. who is a Man of great Riches, to manage the vast Revenue of that Province; which sets him up so high, that he is above the reach of all the Gran∣dees of the Empire, and is Honoured and Reverenced as the Dominus Fac totum, or as Joseph in the Land of Egypt. The French Nation had at that time a Consul in Cairo, who thought himself a Match for the Jew; who on the other side esteemed himself higher than all the Chri∣stians, or Beyes, or Agaw's of Egypt; and consequently comported himself with Neglect and Disesteem towards the French Consul, which he not being able to support, made his Complaints to the French Ambas∣sador at Adrianople, against the Insolence of a Jew, of which the Consul gave a most Passionate Report to Monsieur de Chateau∣neuf, then Ambassador for the French King at the Port; where he so managed the Bu∣siness, that a Chiaus was sent for to fetch the Jew from Cairo, to the Divan at Adri∣anople; who accordingly taking this long Journey, appeared in Judgment before the Grand Vizier. This Jew had the Report amongst all People, of being a Person very Judicious, Prudent, and of a patient Temper; and since it was the Office of the Ambassador to appear against this Jew in Judgment be∣fore the Grand Vizier, the Jew behaved himself with so much Modesty, and Pru∣dence, that he gave unto all the Standers by, some deep Impressions of his Under∣standing and Innocence, and that he had been injured by the French Consul at Cairo, of whose Honesty and Wisdom, the World in those Parts, had not conceived any high Opinion, nor yet of the French Nation: But that depending too much on their great Friendship with the Turks, they presumed to insult over a People, which had not for some Ages been accustomed to hard Usages from Christian Nations. Notwithstanding all which, and that the Grand Vizier had patiently understood the Pleadings on both sides, and was as well possessed with the Cabals of the French Nation, yet he gave Orders to the Chi∣aus-Bashee to take the Jew into Arrest; the which was said to have been done out of Policy by the Vizier, to cool, and mo∣derate the Anger of the Ambassador, who plainly declared, That unless his Master, the King, had satisfaction in this particular, he was commanded to retire back into France, and to bring with him all the French Mer∣chants, and all others of that Nation, into their own Country. It not being now a time for the Turks to Quarrel with the French, or to create more Enemies than they have already, they took these Menaces with an unaccu∣stomed Patience, tho' the Great Officers being offended hereat, vented an abun∣dance of Reproaches against the French
Nation; only the Grand Vizier using his accustomed Patience, said, That Justice could never do Injury to any, for that their Law, and the Alchoran, commanded it so to be done. And in this manner this Difference pas∣sed over, with some Advantage to the French, who had obliged so great a Person as the Jew, who is the Negotiator of all the Affairs of Egypt, to leave his Employ∣ment to attend the Summons of the French Ambassador at such a distance as it is from Gran Cairo to Adrianople: Howsoever after all this, the French Nation did not seem to be fully satisfied, because that the Vizier after all shewed some Respect to the Jew, bestowing upon him a Coftan, or Vest of Favour and Honour, declaring himself in favour of the Jew, that he had been falsely accused, and injuriously drawn away from the Grand Seignior's Service. To repair which Affront and Neglect to the King of France, a Demand was made by the Am∣bassador, That License might be given to Repair and Rebuild the Cathedral Church in Galata, which had for above 500 Years remained in the Christian Hands, and last∣ly had been Repaired and Rebuilt at the Charges of the Most Serene Republick of Venice, soon after the last War which they had with the Turks in Candia; but now the French depending on the great Services they had done the Turks, seized on the Church, which had been the Cathedral of that Diocese, and affixed the Arms of France upon the Gates thereof; at which the Venetians being greatly offended, who were the Patrons thereof, and had many Years past purchased the Advowson from the Turks, made their Complaints to the Grand Vizier of the Injustice which had been done them: Upon which, the Vizier resolving to end the Controversie between the Christians, seized the Church of Saint Francis or Francisco, in Galata, and Con∣verted it into a Turkish Mosch; and in such like manner commonly end all the Con∣troversies which Christians have between themselves, that are referred to, or to be termined by, the Turks. The Ceremony which the Turks used in turning the Christian Church into a Mosch, was by a Command from the Sul∣tan to the Chimacam, to enter the Church with 200 Men of his Followers, together with a good Number of their Imaums, who began at their first Entry into the Church to sing with a loud Voice, the Tune and Song called Sele, which is a Hymn extracted out of the Alcoran, to the Praise and Glory of God; the which cau∣sed great Sadness in the Hearts and Eyes of many good Christians in Galata; which had not been done, as many Turks confess, had not the French pretended a Right to that Church; with which they in a short time were forced to swallow two very bitter Pills, to the Dishonour of France, and Prejudice to the Christian Cause. Towards the end of the Month of March,March. the Sultan equipped out seven great Men of War of 50 and 60 Pieces of Cannon each, and all armed with 500 Levents, or so many Sea-Soldiers a piece; besides which there were 14 light Gallies, with 25 Fri∣gats, and all accompanied with divers Sai∣ches laden with Provisions, every one of which will carry as much as 200 Carts, which are laden with Biskets, Meal, and all sorts of other Ammunition. Whilst these things were in Action, the French Ambassador, Monsieur de Chateaneuf, offered this Summer to make his Campaign with the Grand Seignior in Hungary against the Emperor, with which the Turks were well enough pleased, in regard they esteem∣ed this Ambassador to be a Man of great Wisdom and Experience. Tekely likewise about this time was pre∣paring himself to accompany the Vizier to the War in Hungary, the which some were of an Opinion, That it would be of good consequence to the Sultan; upon which account the Vizier conceived a great esteem for him; and was desirous to see the good Effects of all those Promises, which Tekely's Princess had made to him. This Lady of Tekely went unto, and re∣turned from Adrianople, and was observed to be of an Humour very Assiduous, Dili∣gent, and Malitious against the Imperial∣lists, but very kind and obliging towards the French, but most especially to Mon∣sieur de Laurent, who the last Year was with the Sultan in the Campaign of Hun∣gary, and was often invited by Tekely's Lady, and by Count Tekely himself, to take a Dinner, or a Supper, or some other Repast with them, at which Monsieur de Laurent was often welcomed, and highly Treated. A Friend of mine once acquainted me, That having a Curiosity to see the Wife, or Princess of Tekely, he had the Fortune to hear Mass with her at the Capuchin's Church at Galata, where well observing her Physiognomy, it appeared very Ill-favour'd, Old, and Ugly: She professes to be a Roman Catholick, of which she boasts to many People, and that her Hus∣band hath divers Correspondents almost in every Regiment belonging to the Imperial Army, from whom he hath all the Cor∣respondencies imaginable with the Princi∣pal
Commanders both of Horse and Foot, by means of which nothing passes, but what he hath a good and perfect Account of, from all parts of the Imperial Ar∣my. The Army which was formed and drawn up against the Moscovites, consisted for the most part of Spahee's from Anatolia, and of a sort of a Militia of Pascialagio, belonging to Silistra, of which they reck∣oned about 35000 Men, besides Tar∣tars. The Reputation of this present Sultan was so great, that in all Parts both of Asia, Africa, and Europe, he was esteemed the most Fortunate of all the Sultans; for that in the space of two Years only appearing in the Wars, he had showed so much Cou∣rage and good Conduct, that he had al∣ways beaten the Germans; that is to say, when he went himself in Person to the Wars; for which cause he was highly E∣steemed, Honoured, and Obeyed. But as to the Rebels in Asia, they drew themselves up very formidably in the Field, expecting to encounter the Army of the Port, and to give them Battel. The great Power and Nerve of the Otto∣man Force is at present in Asia, that of the Turk-men, who are a sort of People well mounted on very strong and Warlike Hor∣ses, Brave, and Valiant, and well Exerci∣sed in the Lance, and Bow; so that there was great expectation when some Feats of Arms would begin: And on the other side of Anatolia, they began to Transport over their Militia, being designed early this Year against the Moscovites, after which the Actions in Hungary were to begin. But before that something may be dis∣coursed in relation to the present State of the Greek Church,The Greek Patriarch a Rash Man. the Patriarch of which was very Froward and Passionate, ready to act any thing which came into his Head, without consideration of the Prejudice which might result thereby: And accord∣ingly having a Quarrel with the Metropo∣lite, or Bishop of Salonica, he deprived him of his Title and Office, on occasion of some Disobedience to certain Com∣mands, to which the Patriarch would oblige him; but the Bishop not being able to sup∣port the same, out of a Madness, and Fu∣ry, and transport of Rage, he made a Voy∣age from Salonica to the Grand Vizier, to whom he offered 15 Purses, on condition, That in Despight of the Patriarch he might be re-established again in his Diocese of Sa∣lonica, or Thessalonica: And to incline the Vizier the better hereunto, he demonstra∣ted that hereby the Grand Seignior in this time of War might gain great Advantages; For that in case the Vizier would accept of these 15 Purses, it might be an Example to other Metropolites, to offer some 20, some 15, and others 10, according to the Value, and Riches of the Diocese; the which Proposition much pleased the Sul∣tan, having a good pretence thereby to charge all the Metropolites, or Bishops; the which being many in the Greek Church, brought a considerable Sum to the Grand Seignior. The Greek Patriarch hearing hereof, made his Journey to Adrianople, there to make his Complaints against this hard Usage of∣fered to the Greek Church and Nation; the which irritated very much the Anger of the Moscovites against the Turks: And tho' the Moscovites did greatly at this time threaten Caffa, and give Terrour and Affrightment so far as to Constantinople it self, yet the Sultan did not neglect the Thoughts and Contrivances of carrying forward his War in Hungary, with as little Expence as was possible, all Charges being retrenched;Tekely's Poor State and Condi∣tion. a∣mongst which one particular, was that of Tekely, to whom no more than five Dollars were allowed a Day, that was for the Maintenance of his Lady, Servants, Hor∣ses, and other Parts of his Epuipage; on∣ly to help them they gave a Liberty, or License to sell Wine, which was at that time prohibited: And here it was that he set up his Wine-Sellar within the Greek Li∣berties, near to the Privileges of the Pa∣triarchate, where he continued to exercise the Trade of selling Wine with very good Benefit and Advantage; without which, the five Dollars per Day could not have yielded to him and Family half his Subsi∣stence. And being now entered into the Month of April,April. four of the Men of War belong∣ing to Barbary, arrived before the Arsenal of Galata, where other Men of War re∣mained also at an Anchor, and frequently fired their Cannon, with a Chi viva at every Shot, or to the Fortune of the For∣tunate Sultan. On this occasion, the Barbarouses brought their usual Presents, as accustomary to the Sultan, and designed to remain in the Port until the Departure of the Fleet prepared against the Venetians, consisting of 23 Men of Mar, should be in a readiness to Sail: And thus the Sultan being resolved to car∣ry on the War both by Sea and Land, did neither rest Day nor Night, but busied himself in the proving of his Cannon, and making his Warlike Preparations with dili∣gence, was so pleasing to the People, that never was any Sultan so acceptable to the Soldiery, as was this Mustapha, and the
more highly was he esteemed, in regard he was a great Lover of Justice, which is the Prime Ornament of Emperors, and of the highest Monarchs: But notwithstand∣ing all the Care of this Grand Seignior, and the Preparations he made for the War of the following Year, yet his Force nei∣ther by Sea nor Land, did amount unto the Strength of that of the preceding Year; by reason the Rebels in Asia becom∣ing more powerful, a Proclamation was is∣sued forth, That none should Transport them∣selves out of Asia into Europe, on Penalty of having their Houses demolished, and their Pos∣sessions of Timar and Ziamet to be all Ruined and Destroyed, with all the Lands they held of the Sultan. With which Menaces the Re∣bels, who were Soldiers, were so incensed, that such as they took for Prisoners, they did not Kill, but what was worse, they cut off their Noses and Ears, and in that Con∣dition they sent them to the Port, that therewith they might make a report of their Strength and Power. Farther, there was a Report, That these Rebels (as formerly it had been done) de∣manded the Life of the Valide Soltana, which is the Queen Mother, and whereof there have been two Examples in former Times, and of one Mulchi Kadun, a great Favourite, whom they cut in Pieces, by reason that they would not endure the Go∣vernment nor Counsel of Women; suf∣fering howsoever the Queen Mother to live, because she did not make Intrigues in the Affairs of State: Of which the Asian Soldiers being put in mind, and also the Europeans of their Tumults, let us expect to see the Issue of these Tragedies. The Tumults in Asia gave great Disqui∣ets to the Affairs of the Turks in Europe, and retarded all things, or put them back∣ward, and all in expectation of Succours from the Levant, but none coming, the Sultan resolved howsoever to begin his March, and to that end appointed the Days thereof, the several Camps, and the Days of their Movements, it being deter∣mined to remain nine Days under the City of Philippopolis, and on the 4th of July to pass Sophia, and to make seven Days March thereof, where having fixed their Tents for some Days, then to proceed for Nissa, and there also to halt for some Days; all which was done with such slowness, as might give time to the Asian Troops to o∣vertake the main Body of the Army; the which not appearing, the Sultan received divers Letters from the Pasha of Bosnia, beg∣ging with great Instances that he might have Relief and Succours sent to him, whereby to raise the Siege of Bihatz, which the Imperialists had closely begirt on all sides: Whereupon the Sultan dispatch∣ed away those few Pasha's which he had with him, and all the Forces near Belgrade, and also all the Arnauts, and all for the Succours and Relief of Bihatz. The Turks found themselves much more Weak than they had been the Year before, and no appearance of Recruits from Asia, nor any hopes of quieting the Troubles in those Countries, whereupon the Grand Seignior, finding himself greatly Distressed, he very urgently sent his Imperial Com∣mands from his Camp before Philippopolis, to those Pasha's who were appointed to at∣tend and watch the Motion of those Re∣bels, commanding them, that (laying aside all Excuses, they should in the ivell's Name, leave those Rebels to their own Imaginations, and send him five of those Pa∣sha's with 300 Horse a piece, in the lieu of those which he formerly dispatched for those Parts; namely, the Pasha of Da∣mascus, call'd Mustapha Pasha, who had been the late Vizier; the Pasha of Aleppo, Osman; the Pasha of Sebaste, Usuf Pasha; the Pasha of Diarbekir, Mustapha Pasha; and the Pasha of Adana, call'd Fusli Pasha; but when these might be expected from so long a Journey, was very uncertain; so that the Turks themselves were very doubt∣ful of the Event and Successes of this Year; for that all the Power which the Turks could make up, could not amount un∣to above 40000 Men, with Horse and Foot. Things remaining in this posture, it was the Opinion of most People, That the Sul∣tan would not go this Year to the War, but only in appearance, and that he would only be upon the Defensive, avoiding all Fights and Encounters in the Field. And as to the Moscovites, the Reports were va∣rious, and full of uncertainty. All this time the Sultan remained at So∣phia, chearful, and much pleased to un∣derstand that the Polanders had declared the Prince of Conti for their King, which could not but produce a Peace with that Kingdom, and an Union with that Crown; which tho' not true, yet it gave the Turks hopes of an Addition of 30000 Coruzzi unto their Forces against the Germans; who as they did assault Tokay the last Year with good Success, so they were full of hopes to do the like for this also, with the Posses∣sion of several other Castles and Fortres∣ses: But then it was thought necessary that Tekely should be sent to them with Title of King of Hungary; which when the Sultan understood, with the good Ty∣dings, That Bihatz did bravely defend it
self, with Assurances of conserving the same against all Enemies, it was esteemed News of such Importance, that the Grand Seignior gave Commands to the Grand Vi∣zier, to Write the News into all Parts, and particularly unto Tekely, That the Grand Seignior had declared him King of Hunga∣ry, for which the Sultan had sent him a Commission, with a Letter, the Super∣scription of which was, Orla Maggiar Croli, which signifies in the Hungarian Language, To the King of Hungary: To which were added also some Purses of Money for de∣fraying the Charges of his Journey, and adorning his Equipage. Tekely's Afflictions.This Command came very unfortunate∣ly at this time for Tekely, who was then grievously afflicted with the Gout, and pre∣paring, for Recovery of his Health, to pass over to the Baths, and Medicinal Waters of Prusia, or Bruscia, which fall from that Mountain, which was anciently called, Mount Olympus: But what was worse, the Chiauses came furiously upon him at Pru∣sia, and without Compassion, Comple∣ment, or good Manners, threw him into a Carr like a Log to make him a King, without any Respect, which was most mi∣serable for him; for he had not only the Gout, but had a Paralytical Distemper up∣on him, so as that he was seized with a Palsie in his Head, Neck and Arms: And in this manner he was carried Day and Night in a Waggon, until he came unto the sight of the Sultan. All this time the Sultan remained at So∣phia, whilst the Army, or greatest part thereof, marched towards Belgrade, and some into Bosnia; and having received some Advices out of Asia, That the Rebels of that Country, were inclinable to a Sub∣mission, and made some Evidences as if they intended to return to their Duty and Obedience: The Sultan became very much pleased, and put himself that time into an excellent Humour, and thereupon was induced to dispatch several Aga's into Ana∣tolia, with Letters written under his own Hand, in an Humble and Caressing Style, not usual for any Sultan before that time to Write, Swearing, In the first place, To grant Pardon to all, and a general Amnesty to such, as should re∣turn to their Duty of Obedience. Secondly he swore, That he would do Ju∣stice to all in their Just Demands and Pre∣tensions. Thirdly, That he would give every Man satisfaction. Fourthly, That he would damnifie no Man either in his Goods, or Estate, or Life; but on the contrary reward every Man according to his Deserts, provided that they became O∣bedient, and Deserted the Party of the Male-contented Beys, or Pasha's, against whom are so many Examples of God's Vengeance and Ju∣stice: Of which he advised them well to con∣sider before they entered into a March, which would conduct them to his Terrible and Af∣frighting Presence; which if they did not accept and do, he Swore, That he would make up a Peace with the Christians, and March in Person into Anatolia, there to take Vengeance upon them for their Offences, and extirpate the whole Race of those who have taken up Arms against the Mussulman Cause; for which, by the Laws of the Alcoran, they are to Die, and without Mercy to suffer Death. This News being carried to the hearing of the Male-contents, about 10000 of them Deserted the Cause, and proceeded to pass over from Anatolia into Europe, and without any delay took the nearest way to reach and overtake the Army of the Sultan; to hasten which, the Grand Seig∣nior wrote Commands to the Chimacam, and Bostangibashi, to prepare Quarters for them in the Imperial Gardens and Houses as they passed, and that they should in all their Marches, want nothing of Refreshments, nor those who are un∣provided want Arms, or any other thing necessary for the War; amongst which there were 3000 Bostangees fitted out for the War, from the Grand Seignior's Sera∣glio's: And such Rigorous Courses were spread over all the Countries of the Lesser Asia,August. that those Laws and Commands of the Sultan being put into execution, it was believed impossible for any Embroils, or Seditions, for ever after to arise in the Les∣ser Asia, tho' they could not but be some times apprehensive of Troubles from Per∣sia; for since the time that this King was Crowned, he was always esteemed a Troublesome and a Dangerous Enemy to the Turks; for tho' he was not wanting in his Courtships, and Embassies to the Otto∣man Court, as we have seen, yet he was still encouraging the Georgians, and the Persians in the Parts of Basora, to be trou∣blesome to the Turks. The Sultan still remained at Sophia, where having Advices from the Frontiers, he dispatched away a Capugibashee to his Mother the Valide Soltana, giving her to understand, That his Forces had fallen up∣on a Body of Germans, which he had rout∣ed;
and taken the strong Fortress of Titul, in which he had put all the Garrison to the Sword; and did not doubt, but speedily to enter into Transylvania; from whence he promised to send his Mother a Present of some fine Young Ladies to attend, and wait upon her, and to be conducted by some of those Black Eunuchs, which were attending at that time upon his Per∣son. After such Vapours and Boastings as these, which the Sultan expressed to his Mother, it was not judged to be longer Honourable for the Grand Seignior to re∣main at Sophia, a place so far distant from the Ottoman Camp in Hungary; whereup∣on marching with the Main Body of his Army, slowly, and in good Order, Mes∣sengers were sent unto Sarchan Pasha, then at Belgrade, who was then the General, and esteemed an excellent Soldier, and a Couragious Man, and well acquainted with the Countries about those Confines, to hasten his March to meet the German Army: And so also the Sultan followed, and arrived in good time to joyn the Main Body of the Front about Titul. In the Re∣lation of which Battel, there were two Accounts sent from Constantinople; one of the 29th of October, and another of the 5th of November. The Battle of the Ti∣biscus.Such as were on this side of the Tibis∣cus, and saw the Battel, report, That the Rout consisted only of such, as with great difficulty passed the Tibiscus by their Swim∣ing, and they report, That the Turks could never imagine, that it was possible for the Imperialists so soon to Attack them, as that Day they did; much less that it was possible for the Grand Vizier to pass his Cannon, Ammunition, Provisions, with all the Militia of Janisaries over that Bridge, and thence to proceed to Segedin, and so into Transylvania, and into the Upper Hun∣gary. In the mean time the Imperialists kept on their March to meet the Turks, and ha∣ving prepared their Trenches, they fortifi∣ed themselves therein, which caused the Grand Vizier to assemble all his Pasha's, which were to the Number of 15, leaving the Sultan on the other side of the Water, with a Body of Spahee's, and Silishars, which are a sort of Spahees belonging to the Court, together with the Solakbassees, who are a sort of Pages also belonging to the Court; but the Taraklee Spahees, who are Timars and Zaims, followed the Pasha of their own Province and Country; of which making an Account of their Num∣bers, they calculated them to amount unto 25000, all Expert Men, who managed their Arms to a Miracle, but were in this Battle either Killed, or Drow ed. The Arnauts observing the German Ar∣my to be marching to Attack them, were the first who endeavoured to pass the Bridge, and to put themselves to Flight: The Janisaries also had the like Intenti∣ons to do the same, saying, That they had been Abandoned and Deserted by the Spahees: And as they approached near to the Bridge, the Grand Vizier observing a Disposition in the Arnauts to pass the Bridge, and fly, he assembled a Body of his own Aga's to∣gether, intending therewith to hinder and prevent the Flight, which was done by killing a great Number of them. The Arnauts finding themselves so ill Treated, they put themselves into a Muti∣ny, or rather into a Rebellion against the Grand Vizier, and killed him: After which some Thousands of the Spahee's placing themselves on the other side of the Bridge, with their Swords drawn in their Hands, they defended the Bridge, and suffered none to pass over it. By this time the Imperialists having put themselves into good Order of Battel, fu∣riously Attacked the Turks on all sides: At the first Charge the Turks made some Resistance, but at the second they began to give way; and observing the great De∣struction, and Slaughter, that the Fire and Sword made, being terrified therewith, they resolved to cast and precipitate them∣selves into the River, where the greatest part of them perished; all which, as was said, happened in the space of two or three Hours; where could never be greater Confusion, nor greater Effusion of Blood of their own Soldiery, of which the Chief Commanders were Slain without Mercy, or any Quarter, and such a Multitude of Turks, and Chief Pasha's are said to have perished upon the Spot, that during the whole War, the like Slaughter never hap∣pened as this: For according to the Re∣port of those, who were not far from the Presence of the Sultan, during all the time of the Battle, they agree, That according to an Account and List of the Slain, there never happened so Great, and so Terrible a Destruction as this to the Ottoman Army, which more unhappily fell upon the Prin∣cipal Commanders, than upon the Com∣mon Soldiers, which they esteem to be a just Judgment of God upon them; for that no less than 15 Pasha's were killed in this Engagement; five of which had been Beglerbeys, or Viziers of the Bench, be∣sides the Supream Vizier. And such a Slaughter, or Destruction as this, was never known to have happened,
for never in the Memory of Man, or any Age, was it ever known, that five Vizi∣ers had ever fallen in one Battle; amongst which was the Supream Vizier, Giafer Pasha, another Pasha, the Aga of the Ja∣nisaries, a Pasha and Vizier; Missir Oglü a Vizier, Fasli Pasha a Vizier, and the rest of them were all Pasha's of Provinces and Governments. There were 74 Captains, with their Of∣ficers and Soldiers of their several Cham∣bers, all slain: In every Chamber they account 100 Janisaries, of which there may be in some Chambers, 10 or 20 Su∣pernumeraries; so that it may be the ge∣neral Opinion, That above 8000 Janisa∣ries were slain, and those of the bravest and best Soldiers of all the Turkish Mili∣tia, of which the Sultan was so sensible, that he declared, He was not so much trou∣bled for the Number, as for the Quality of such Brave and Experienced Soldiers, who had so often, and in so many Engagements Worsted and Overthrown the Germans. Besides these, were killed in this Bat∣tle, the Kahya-Bey, or Lieutenant Gene∣ral of the Janisaries, with his 600 Braves, which are always attending upon his Per∣son, having so many in that Company, or Regiment, being the first Oda, or Cham∣ber of the Janisaries; for indeed the Ka∣hya-Bey is always more Esteemed, Obey∣ed, and Feared, than the Janisar-Aga him∣self. Amongst the four other Generals of the Militia of the Janisaries, the Zargagi-ba∣shee, who was the Major-General of the Janisaries, was slain; of the other three were ordained one against the Muscovites, and the other two against the Venetians by Sea and by Land: And besides the 74 Captains, as many Beiracters, or Ensigns, were also slain. And besides these 2500 Segmens of Bos∣nia, being divided into several Divisions of the Great Vizier, and divers other Pasha's, with all the Gebegees, who are Armour∣ers, together with their Captains, and Ge∣neral; as also the Gunners and Topegi∣bashees, or Masters of the Ordnance, which are divided into two several Orders of Militia. The gaining of this Battle was of that high Concernment, and the Consequences thereof so considerable, that from thence the Peace following was derived; so that we may believe all the World to be inte∣rested therein, and to be the Subject of the Speculation of the greatest Monarchs of this World. And Instance whereof we have in the following Letter, Written by the Emperor himself, and with his own Hand, in La∣tin, to King William of England, in this Style. The Emperor of Germany's Letter, to King William of England. PAUCAS ante horas desiderato ex Hungariâ nuntio recreamur, quod exercitus noster sub ductu Principis Eu∣genii de Sabaudia die decimo currentis Mensis, Ottomanica Castra ad Tibiscum triplici aggere munita, & triginta fere ho∣stium Millibus propugnata, non solum fortiter aggressus sit, verum etiam Divi∣no juvante numine foelicitèr superavit, caesis in loco decem & amplius millibus quos inter Supremus Visirius, & Janisa∣riorum-Aga numerantur, reliquique quos Pontis Angustia capere non potuit in Flu∣men praecipitati & maximam in partem submersi, Tormentis etiam 72, una cum aliquot mille curribus, & commeatu in potestatem redactis, nostra vero ex par∣te tantum 500 occisis, & totidem sau∣ciatis. Englished thus. IT is within some few Hours, that the Post is arrived from Hungary, bringing News, That our Army under the Command and Con∣duct of Eugenius Prince of Savoy; did not only on the 10th of this instant Month, Vali∣antly Attack the Ottoman Camp fortified up∣on the Banks of Tibiscus, or Theysse, with a treble Ditch, and with a Force of Thirty Thousand Men therein, but assisted by the Gracious Favour of Almighty God, most hap∣pily subdued them, killing Ten Thousand of them upon the Place; amongst which, were the Supream Vizier, and Aga of the Janisa∣ries, and the rest, which the narrowness of the Bridge could not contain, threw and pre∣cipitated themselves into the River, where the greatest part of them were Drowned; with Seventy two Pieces of their Cannon, with some Thousands of Waggons laden with Pro∣visions, which all fell into our Hands; and all which was done on our sides with the loss only of 500 Men, and about as many Woun∣ded.
After this Battle was ended, all was in great Confusion amongst the Turks, and e∣very one shifted as well as he could to e∣scape. The Grand Seignior himself posted to Temeswaer, from whence he dispatched a Black Eunuch to his Mother, with the un∣happy News of the late ill Success, and the Particulars of it, to avoid false Reports, which upon this Occasion might be apt to be spread abroad of the Death of himself; and other Sinister Rumours more fatal to the Empire than ever was known afore times, and might terrifie the Valide Solta∣na; who by the News of the Life of her Son, might take Heart, and receive Com∣fort, and prevent the Mutinies amongst the Soldiery and People, who were too ready upon such an Evil Report, to En∣throne the Brother of Sultan Achmet, the last Brother of the three lately Deceased: But it being known that Sultan Mustapha was certainly Alive, all was pacified; which being of so great Importance, the Grand Seignior sent a Letter, as I said, to his Mother, by a Black Eunuch, by way of Nicopolis, who was a Magriplee, or an Abyssine, or Ethiopian, well beloved by the Queen, and greatly Confided in by her. The Relation on the side of the Turks, was represented as favourably as the thing would bear; in which he declared, That there had been a very great Battle near a River, in which his Person was not pre∣sent, and so was safe; but his Vizier be∣ing Engaged against an Army of 100000 Men, was Slain, together with the great∣est Number of Janisaries, and Foot Soldi∣ers, and those of the Principal Officers; the which Relation he also dispatched by the second Master of the Horse, with a Coftan to Hussaein Pasha, declaring him to be Grand Vizier, which happened well for the Christians; for he was a Man al∣ways inclined to a Peace, and no great Friend to the French;Inclinati∣ons of the Turks to∣wards a Peace. he was a great Lo∣ver of Wine, which mollified the Rigorous Temper of a Turk, and made him more Jo∣cund and Easie than commonly the Water-Drinkers amongst the Turks profess to be; at which News the Christians immediately conceived an abundance of Joy, not doubt∣ing but that a Peace would immediately ensue, as it did accordingly; for all Peo∣ple were grown weary of so long a War, which had now continued for about twen∣ty Years, with very Unfortunate Successes to the Turks both by Sea and Land. After all which the Grand Seignior re∣turned with what speed he could to his Se∣raglio at Adrianople, where all things had put on a Countenance of Melancholy and Sadness. In the mean time the Christians resolving to prosecute and follow their Blow, whilst the Turks with Fear and Disorder were fly∣ing homeward, the Prince Eugenius of Savoy, spent the whole Day on the 12th of October in passing the Imperial Army over the Save;October but the River being nar∣row, and the Weather good and favoura∣ble, they arrived early in the Camp on the other side: And next Morning of the 13th, they began their March towards Bosnia, which was difficult to pass, by reason of the Mountains, Woods, and Rocks in the way, which was rude, and unbeaten. Upon the 14th of this Month, the Bo∣dy of the Army Encamped about Kottor, where the March had been worse, and more difficult, and longer by an Hour than the Day before; and tho' Colonel Kyba with his Squadron was marched before, howso∣ever he proceeded not in his March, be∣cause he had News on the way, and chief∣ly from Bagnaluca, That the Enemy had not the least Intelligence of the Advance of the Imperial Army, so that he made a Halt until His Most Serene Highness was come up to joyn the Body under his Command, that so they might hold a Conference, and Council of War together, which they per∣formed standing not to lose time; and then Colonel Kyba proceeded with his Forces unto Castle Doboy, where was a Garrison of Turks, and was situated two or three Hours from the Christian Camp: And here it was thought fit not to go farther this Night, because they concluded, that they were not as yet discovered by the E∣nemy, because they had not heard them shoot the Alarm, as their Custom was to do whensoever they discovered any Body of Men approaching towards them; and so to keep all things still without any dis∣covery, they marched with much silence, without Beat of Drum, or Sound of Trum∣pet: And the very same Day the Prince of Savoy arrived in the Camp; where a Coun∣cil of War being called, it was concluded, That Colonel Kyba should be dispatched away before, to take Possession of some Ground near to the Turkish Castle of Doboy, as was formerly agreed, and there to form his Camp, where he was reinforced with 600 Men: Upon appearance of which, his Orders were, That in case the Castle did not presently Surrender, he should march immediately forward, and without loss of time march into the Country, leaving the last 600 Men before the Castle to inclose the Enemy, who should soon be reinforced by 200 Men more: And so should pro∣ceed to the second Castle, called Maglay;
where finding Opposition, he should leave that likewise,October. and so proceed forward. By this time, or towards the Morning of the 15th of this Month, some Shooting was heard, which was the first Signal of an Alarm: Howsoever they continued to March without beating their Drums, or sounding their Trumpets; but this Days March was more troublesome and difficult than the Day before, by reason that it was through Hilly and rough Places: Howso∣ever coming at length to Castle Doboy, they Summoned the Place to Surrender, the which being denied at first, by the Turks in Garrison, the Christians laboured all Night, and in that time raised a Battery, on which they planted six Pieces of Cannon, with two Mortar-pieces. Castle Doboy Surrenders.The Day following the Cannon begin∣ning to play, the Turks Capitulated, and Surrendered themselves at Discretion and Mercy of the Enemy. The Garrison consisted of about 80 Men, out of which they made Prisoners of such as appeared to be the most Soldier-like Men; as for others, who were Old, and Infirm, with Women, and Children, they gave them liberty to shift for themselves, and go to what Places they pleased. In the Castle little Provision was found, and few Arms, so that Colonel Kyba, ac∣cording to his Instructions from the Gene∣ral, proceeded in his March: And On the 17th came to the Castle Maglay, which upon the first Summons Surrender∣ed, on condition only to go out with their Wives and Children, leaving all other things behind them. On the 18th by Break of Day in the Morning, the Garrison of Maglay marched out, and Surrendered the Place: About which time nothing more was heard from the Enemy, only that the Kahya, the Son of the Deceased Pasha, was Encamped near Orossa Viza, and that the Imperial Fora∣gers were annoyed much by the Meroders of the Enemy. On the 18th they appeared before the Palanca or Pass called Schebze, wherein were 300 Turks: which upon the Sum∣mons demanded a time of Consideration until the next Day, which the General of the Imperialists would not grant them; but advanced with 400 Foot Soldiers, and 300 Dragoons, with the Artillery belong∣ing to them, and mounting 12 Pieces of Cannon against the Palanca, in the Night they stormed it in two Places; in which Attack having lost 12 or 15 Men within the Pallisadoes, without any stop, they still advanced forward, whilst Colonel Kyba meeting with 200 Horse of the Ene∣my, whose Design was to cast them∣selves into the Pass Schebze, but were pre∣vented, being in part killed, and in part taken Prisoners: And having Intelligence, That the Kahya was with a Body of about two or 3000 Men, between Schelze and Branduck, he caused Batteries to be raised to hinder their ready Passages. On the 19th they marched on through the Orohovizar Valley, being a very trou∣blesome Passage at the first Entrance thereinto, not only for the Narrowness and Streightness of the Road, but also be∣cause the Enemies on both sides had cut and ruined the Ways; so that about three a Clock in the Afternoon, the last Regi∣ments, which were Horse, entered the Field, and joyned the former Troops, but the Infantry came not thither until it was Night; and as to the Artillery and Bag∣gage, they remained full half an Hours March behind, at a distance from the nar∣row Passage, where it remained all the Night guarded by two Regiments of Dra∣goons, which in the Morning marched in safe Conduct, and guarded them in safety to the Body of the Army. The 20th the March was through Nar∣row and Rocky Passages, worser than the former, or that way which leads to the Castle Branduck, which was so difficult, that the Imperial Army would have been in a very ill Condition, had the Turks been capable of disputing vigorously the Passage with them: But at length having passed the most rough and difficult Ways of Branduck, which were so inconvenient, that the Artillery and Baggage could not be brought after them, but were forced to be lodged under a strong Guard on the Orohovizar Valley, where the Places were fairer and more pleasant, but the Inhabi∣tants were fled and gone, but had left be∣hind them all sorts of good Fruits, with small and large Cattle in great Numbers, with sufficient Herbage and Sustenance to maintain them. The 21st the Imperial Army arrived near the River Bosna, over which there was a Bridge, but so Old and Ruinous, that the Army was not willing to adventure a Pas∣sage over it, but rather esteemed it more secure for every Dragoon, or Horseman to take a Man behind him, and therewith to Wade through the River; with this Burden and Equipage they marched over a very high Hill for the space of two Hours, which nevertheless was more easie to pass over than the former: So they continued their March again over the Bosna, by the help and convenience of a good strong Bridge, not ruined by the Enemy, and so
advanced into the Camp, near the Village Doboy, where Colonel Kyba joyned again with Prince Eugenius, advancing still be∣fore the same Night towards Sarai, or Se∣raglio, to observe the Place, to which great Numbers of People of that Country were fled for security: But because that City was not capable to receive such Mul∣titudes of People, great Numbers of them were forced to lodge before the City Gates, so as the Prisoners declared, which toge∣ther with those in the City, would make up a Body of 30000 Men, but they want∣ed Arms very much:October. So that tho' the Ka∣hya was then personally present in the Ci∣ty; yet his Power and Authority was weak to dispose Matters into any tolera∣ble State and Condition of Defence. But the Imperialists found this Part very Fair, Fruitful, and well Built; and there∣fore the Christians and Inhabitants of that Land went to the Imperial Camp to ren∣der themselves up under their Prote∣ction. At the beginning of this March, on the 22d, the Troops found the Ways Narrow, Crooked, and Deep, but afterwards pas∣sed into a more pleasant Place, called Vi∣sega, and then repassed again the River Bosna, over a Bridge; at the end of which, after an Hours time they Encamped; and by this time Colonel Kyba was come back with his People, who had done some Exe∣cution against the Inhabitants in their March, killing some, and making Prisoners of others, which put the City of Seraglio into great Amazement and Confusion, whilst several Parties of the Enemy roved round the adjacent Parts, and took several Prisoners; at which time a Cornet, with a Trumpeter, were sent into Seraglio, to Summon the City to submit willingly, or otherwise no Quarter should be given to a∣ny of them. The 23d two Parties sent out the Day before, returned back again very early in the Morning, before the breaking up of the Imperial Army, bringing no News, or Advice from the Enemy: Only the Cornet gave a Relation, That as he was going to Se∣raglio, for almost a Quarter of an Hours time he had met with no Body at all; but after∣wards falling in amongst the Turks, to whom having made a Sign with his Hand, he show∣ed them the Writing he had with him, which were Proposals for the Surrender of the City; but that he happened to see the Trumpeter killed before his own Eyes, and with much difficulty, with divers Wounds escaped him∣self: And farther reported, That all the In∣habitants in great haste went out of Sera∣glio. After this the Army in a Body march∣ed to the City, which the Turks had quit∣ted, and abandoned, leaving none remain∣ing but Christians and Jews, from whom they took all they could find, but nothing of great Value, in regard the Turks had not only disposed of the best of their own Goods, but likewise before their Flight had Plundered the Houses of the Christi∣ans, and committed the Guard of the Ca∣stle to a Garrison of 150 Men; and the same Day towards Evening a Fire broke out in the City, of which no care being taken to Extinguish it, it was totally burnt and consumed. The Castle howsoever was not burnt, for it being built of Stone, re∣quired leisure to demolish, which at that time could not be allowed. Howsoever several Parties on the 24th returned from abroad, bringing some Pri∣soners with them, and many poor Christi∣ans came likewise Voluntarily in, with Re∣solution to pass the Save, upon the Return of the Imperial Army; which happened to be on the 25th and 26th, but Colonel Kyba staid, (as he usually did) some time be∣hind to burn and destroy every thing that remained, as yet unconsumed. And on the 27th they marched on, un∣til they came to the Camp, which was be∣fore Seniza. And on the 28th they entered into bad Defiles, and at length into the Valley of Orohovitz, where the Artillery and Wag∣gons joyned again with the Army. The 29th they Encamped near Schebze; where Advices were brought to the Gene∣rals in what manner the Enemy was ga∣thered into a Body near Belgrade, consi∣sting of several Thousands of Men. Lastly, The Imperialists returned again over the Save, carrying with them a great quantity of Turkish Cloth, with many Tur∣kish Women, and Goods belonging to the saved Christians, with a great quantity of small and great Cattle. After the Return of the Christian Army under the Command of Prince Eugenius of Savoy, from the Fortunate Successes in Bos∣nia, the Troops were commanded on the 30th of October, to march from Marga, to∣wards Caranzebes; from whence, on the very same Evening, Lieutenant-Colonel Count of Herberstein, was Commanded to March before, with his National Mi∣litia of Rascians, joyned with some Ger∣mans. And the 31st was appointed for a Day of Repose, and Rest for the whole Army; and on that Occasion sufficient Provisions were made both for Horse and Man.
When on the first of November the Body of the Army began to move from Caran∣zebes, and in grievous Weather, with Rain and Snow, marched all the way so far as Soczan: And then about two a Clock in the Afternoon they made a Halt near Gialuk, in the Valley of Carassona. And on the third they pitched near the deserted Village of Petrovizas. From whence on the 4th Days March, a Detachment was sent before to Invest the Fort of Vypalancha, where the Lieutenant-Colonel of the Regiment of Rabutin, Lord of Graser, with a Body of 500 Horse, had taken his Post, or Possession, and seated himself on the side of the Danube about 100 Paces from the River, advancing to the Pallisadoes, and there immediately be∣gan to fire upon the Place, and to Entrench with so much diligence, that in a short time they had opened the Trenches 200 Paces; and having prepared the small Pieces of Cannon, which they brought with them, and one Mortar-piece, they began therewith to make their Batte∣ries. The 5th Day in the Morning, they set in order their Batteries, and began also to throw Bombs into the Palanca, which they found to be much more strong than it was believed at first; for that it was en∣compassed with a double Ditch, and treble Rows of Pallisadoes, and a place of Re∣treat guarded with 400 Men, and well provided of all things; and for the better Security, they had made some hundreds of Faggots; and in the mean time the Turks in a great Body showed themselves upon another Stream of the Danube above, and others at the Foot of the Mountain, near to Rham, together with Saicks, and Frigats on the River. Likewise on the o∣ther side of Belgrade, near Kroska, Seman∣dria, Columbas, Isbeck, and Gradiska, which were all places so near, that in 24 Hours time, Succours might be brought from them, at least to hinder, if not totally pre∣vent the Designs of the Enemy: For which reason, the General, Count Rabutin, resolved to lose no time, but forthwith to make an Assault upon the Place, and if possible, to take it by force, to which end he prepared 500 Germans, and 200 Ra∣scians to make the Attack upon the Place. On the 6th with dawning of the Day, appeared on the other side of the River, a great number of the Turkish Boats, bat∣tering with their Cannon, as they had done all the Day before against the Christi∣an Camp: And in the mean time, with the Break of Day, the Attack began in two Places at the same time; that is, upon the left Hand of the Danube, where the great∣est difficulty was, under the Command of Heer Viart, Sergeant-Major of the Hano∣ver Troops; and then on the right Hand, on the River Cerasse, where the Soldiers to pass the Water, Waded up to the Middle, under the Command of Captain Beaumont, of the Regiment of Rabutin: And to give the greater Inconvenience to the Enemy, they fired their Cannons continually with∣out Intermission, as also their Bombs, besides Small-shot from 250 Men out of the Trenches; but in regard that in the Night before certain Recruits were sent to reinforce the Place, together with a Boat, on Board of which were 100 Men from Columbas, and Isbeck, with new Ammuni∣tion, so that they met with very much re∣sistance; besides, they Storm'd without making any Breach, and that in the sight of 20 or 30 Saicks and Frigats, which ap∣peared above and below the Place; inso∣much as things looked more doubtful and hazardous, than with any promising Coun∣tenance of Success. Howsoever General de Rabutin and Sergeant-General Count de Leiningen applyed all possible care and In∣dustry to hinder and prevent the Enemies Succours from coming upon them, by which the Soldiers at the appearance, and so near an approach of their Enemies, again reassumed new Courage; and tho' they were at first well enough animated, when they observed the Turks come upon them, with their Cries of Allah, Allah, which they usually make upon their Charge, and that 400 of their Horse remained for a Re∣serve, the Vigour and Spirit was renewed on all sides, and then with Axes and Hat∣chets they cutting down the Pallisadoes, gained so much Ground, that all things laid open before them: So that after a doubt∣ful Conflict of about an Hour and a half, the Place was overcome, and taken by the Valour of the Christians; so that not only the Commander in Chief Hay Beigh, but all the Garrison, with the Inhabitants, without any Exception, were Killed, or droven into the Danube. All which was done and acted in a very short time, which was well that it so happened; for had it admitted of any farther delay, the Christi∣ans would have encountred many more Difficulties, for that the Turks were bring∣ing over many Succours, which would have caused very dangerous Diversions. When on the contrary, the Turks lost 800 Persons, and the Christians only 10, which was almost a Miracle to consider.
General Rabutin was always present on the right Hand, during the Assault, and after it, the better to Encourage the Soldi∣ers, he alighted from his Horse, and ha∣ving Commended and Praised every one publickly in his Place according to his Deserts, and especially the Sergeant-Ge∣neral Count of Leiningen, who had the left Wing under his Conduct, and had done and acted as much as could be expected on such an Occasion; and indeed both he and Sergeant-Major de Viart, showed as much Bravery, Conduct, and Military Experience as could be desired of the greatest Cap∣tains in the World. But now in regard this Pass of Vypalan∣cha was too far within the Territory of the Enemy, to be any long time maintained; for that should the Garrison be German, or Rascian, it would be too much exposed, without any possibility of Relief, the Ge∣neral Rabutin resolved to Slight and Demo∣lish the Place, and accordingly he gave all up to the Flames. And on the seventh Day, so soon as the Cannon were carried away, it was put in∣to execution, which was soon effected by the great Numbers of Country-men and Peasants employed upon that Work; and the same Morning the Camp was removed nearer to the Palancha. The Particulars of Men Killed and Woun∣ded in the Assault of Vypalanca. GERMANS. Killed, Men 10 Horses 26 Wounded, Men 87 Horses 21 Of the ARTILLERY. Killed, 0 Wounded, 1 RASCIANS. Killed, 4 Wounded, 18 Found in the Place. 16 Ensigns exposed round the Town. 63 Turkish Prisoners, and 32 Women. 11 Pieces of Cannon of Copper, carrying from two to eight Pound Ball. 200 Granadoes for the Hand, some Powder, and some few other Warlike Arms. About 200 Bushels of Grain, with some Flour of Wheat. Besides which, all other things were given up to the Plunder of the Soldiers. Besides which, there were above 1000 Pieces of Rock-Salt, which were brought from Valachia. These Successes which the Christians had gained over the Turks in all Places, through the whole Course of this Year 1697, put them into a kind of Despair of being any more Victorious, but rather to yield to the Hand of God, and to fix a Pe∣riod to the Limits of their Empire, which they believed, by the Providence of God, was no farther to be extended. These Thoughts put all the Great Men, and Governors of the Ottoman Empire into such a Melancholy, that contrary to their usual Humour of Pride, and Vain Imagi∣nations of Riches, and Enlargement of Empire, as if the Ottoman Arms were ne∣ver to be weakened, or brought low; all the Powerful and Warlike Men, together with the Sultan, concluded, That after such a Series of Misfortunes; both by Sea and Land, God frowned on their Enterpri∣ses, and would no longer favour their Mar∣tial Proceedings: And therefore, that until
such time as God's Anger against them was appeased, there was no safety but in a Happy Peace, to be Negotiated by the only true Allies of the Ottoman Empire; namely, the Great King William of Great Britain, and the Most Potent Lords, the States General of the Low-Countries, or United Provinces; for whom at that time, namely, for the first the Lord Paget was then Ambassador at the Port; and for the latter was the Heer Colyer, both of them Persons qualified by their Offices, and long Experiences in the Turkish Affairs, to be∣come Mediators and Ministers for their Powerful and Puissant Masters, in Treating a Peace of the greatest Importance of any that hath happened in this, or in the pre∣ceeding Age; unless it be the General Peace, in which all Christendom was so near∣ly concerned. What farther moved the Turks to desire and promote this Peace, was their Ill Suc∣cesses at Bassora, where that Pasha, whom we have formerly mentioned, had carried for some time all before him; and tho' the Persians had often promised their Assistance to the Turks, for Suppression of that Re∣bellion, yet nothing was acted by them in reality, until the Grand Seignior, and the whole Government became sensible, that nothing was to be expected of good either by War, or Peace, but by their own Negotiations; in pursuance of which the Mediation so often offered, was at length accepted, and put into execution at the beginning of the Year 1698. Anno 1698. THIS Year was happily begun with a Resolution on all sides to make the Peace:January. Howsoever at the beginning there∣of things looked very frowningly, with∣out that gentle Prospect, which is com∣monly the Fore-runner of a Peace: For at the beginning of this Month, three Aga's were dispatched from Adrianople, to the Chimacam of Constantinople, with Orders to facilitate their Passage into Asia, by the most Expedite Posts that could be formed; howsoever in their Passage they entered into Conferences with the Chief Ministers at Constantinople, giving them to under∣stand, That they had Orders to Summon the Tartar Han, to appear in Conference at Adrianople, with the Sultan, Mufti, and Grand Vizier, whose Opinions and Reso∣lutions were at first to continue the War; which they declared themselves very a∣ble to do; for tho' it was true, that they had lost the best part and the most flourish∣ing of their Janisaries, and Infantry, yet their Cavalry was almost entire, and able to Engage the Enemy with an Advantage; and were able to form a better Army this, than the last Year. The Tartar Han declared, That he did not fear the Muscovites so much as he did the Cossacks, and the Poles, but of them they are in no great Apprehensions nei∣ther; for that the French Ambassador had promised and assured them, That the Prince of Conti should so disturb the Affairs of Poland, that no danger needed to be feared from that People. And now to strengthen these Proposals, the Sultan decreed, That new Contributi∣ons should be required over all Asia, and Men of great Authority were sent with Bands and Troops of Segmen, and other Militia, to raise the Money by force and power. Orders were also sent to the Chimacam of Constantinople, to put the Forges of Con∣stantinople at work for founding great quan∣tities of Cannon. And that the Maritime Affairs might not be neglected, Mezzo Morto was conti∣nued in the Office of Captain-Pasha, or Admiral, with Orders, and Instructions to sight the Venetians. Thus all things looked as if nothing had been intended besides a War. How∣soever the Great God of Hosts, in whose Hands remains the Balance of Peace and War, having designed otherwise, and at length to give repose, and rest after so long Wars, to the Nations of the Earth, was pleased in his Divine Providence to di∣rect a Conference in the Month of May, between the Great Vizier, the Tartar Han, and the Mufti, at Adrianople, who having considered of the many Difficulties under which the Mahometan Religion, and the Ottoman Empire laboured, gave it as their Opinions to the Sultan, that there could be no safety to either, but in a Peace, for which they produced many Reasons, but none of greater force than that for this Year, no Assistance could be expected from Asia; nor was it possible to recruit in one Years time, the lost Body of the Janisa∣ries, which is the Nerve of the Ottoman Militia; in which Opinion the Chimacam of Adrianople, called Mustapha Pasha, who had formerly been Grand Vizier, concur∣red with the others, and all of them joyn∣ing together in the same Opinion, made their Applications to the Sultan, giving him to understand, That having duly con∣sidered of this important matter, nothing seemed so necessary as a Peace, which God
had now pleased in his Goodness, for the Comfort and Relief of the Mahometan Cause, to offer unto them: The which Declaration and Counsel of these Great Men made to the Sultan, took so much a∣mongst the People, that the Report slew like Lightning, and in five Days time was divulged almost over all the Empire. All the Persons that were present at this private Conference, were the Mufti, Han of Tartary, Aga of the Janisaries, Aga of the Spahees, and Grand Vizier, and the Sul∣tan himself. To make some little appearance of un∣willingness to make a Peace, as if they had been able to continue the War, they sent away towards Belgrade, some Field∣pieces of Brass, which had been lately Cast, or Founded; and on that Occasion 15 Chambers of Janisaries, with their Ci∣urbagees, or Captains, of which every Chamber consisted of 100 Men, but were computed in all to make up 2200 Janisa∣ries, 200 Zebegees, or Armourers, 70 Gunners, which were commanded by a certain Person, called Ali Pasha, who was Brother in Law to the late Grand Vizier: It was reported, That all the Chambers had their full and compleat Numbers, but upon the true Computation, they were found to be much short, and not above 70 in a Chamber; by this kind of Computa∣tion, the poor Estate of the other Militias of the Ottoman Army being to be judged, made the Proposition of a Peace to become much more acceptable to all Sorts and Con∣ditions of Men: One Evidence of which, was the readiness and haste the Grand Seignior and Vizier showed to be upon their March towards Sophia. In order to which, it was appointed, That the Aga of the Janisaries, should on the 6th of June begin their March,June. and that the Sultan should follow two Days af∣terwards being the 8th; for that already towards the latter end of May, all the Ca∣mels, and Horses, which were provided to carry the Tents and Baggage, were arrived at Adrianople. In pursuance whereof the Grand Seig∣nior, and Grand Vizier, began their March on the 8th of June, when it was supposed, That taking Sophia in their way, and making that Place a Quarter of some Days Repose, there to Celebrate the Feast of their little Biram, they might arrive at Belgrade by the 15th of July; when all the Army of the Turks could not amount to more than 40000 Men, tho' they should receive an Addition of 10000 Men from Asia, which was the greatest Number of Soldiers that they could expect this Year from those Parts, and hereof many Hun∣dreds failed of making up that Number. Howsoever in regard that the Peace in Hun∣gary, and other Parts with the Christians, was almost secure and certain, it rais'd a Chearfulness amongst the Turks, so that they little regarded any Apprehensions of a War against the Persians, or their Con∣junction with Bebek Sulyman, a Bold, In∣solent, Daring Person, who lived on the Confines of Persia, whom the Turks desi∣red might be suppressed by the Persians: But the Persian Ambassador, notwithstand∣ing the great Treatments and Civilities he had received from the Turks, made some Difficulties thereof, saying, That it could not be foreseen, or measured, how far such a War as this might go; this Bebek Sulyman being a most Pestilent Fellow, feared as well as beloved, by all the Arabian Princes; so that a War with him might cause much Blood. Howsoever the Turks pressed most ear∣nestly to have this Sulyman suppressed, al∣ledging, Both the Honour and Safety of the Persians was concerned: And to En∣courage them herein, the Grand Vizier promised them the Sultan's Assistance; for that having now made a Peace with the Emperor, and the other Christians, (as might be presumed to be) his Hands were at liberty to carry the War into what Parts of the World that he should think fit; which he should not more readily do to any Region, than against those who might be troublesome on the Frontiers of Persia, and bring Disturbance to the Ottoman Port. Such Friendly Discourses as these passing between the Grand Vizier, and the Persian Ambassador, a Promise was farther made unto him, That the Sultan would not deny any thing to the King of Persia, which might be of satisfaction to him; being resolved to cultivate a most sincere, and lasting Friend∣ship with him, according to the Capitulations lately made and agreed between those two Great and Mighty Monarchs. After which they did Eat, and Feasted together, with high Expressions of Love, and a lasting Friendship; in farther Confir∣mation of which, a Present was made to the Ambassador of another Horse, well Equipped with a Rich and Noble Furni∣ture, and then the Tefter Emini, who was designed to be Ambassador from the Sul∣tan to the King of Persia, and was prepa∣ring for his Journey, was introduced into their Presence, that an Acquaintance might be begun between them; the which was easily effected, considering that the Tefter Emini was a Person of a good Address, and
Skilful, and Practised in the Persian Lan∣guage; he was a Refined Person, and fit, and proper for such an Embassy as this to the Persian Court, whom the Grand Vizier had Chosen, and Elected for this Employ∣ment; for which he was preparing himself with fine Horses of Price, well Equipped with rich Embroidered Saddles, with Arms inlaid with Jewels, and other Gallantries, which might serve for Presents at his Arri∣val at the Court of Ispahan, to the Persian King, such as Quivers, Bows, and Ar∣rows. Besides all which kind Treatment, the Grand Seignior himself Treated him at his Tents without the City of Adrianople; as also did the Chimacam of Constantinople at his Palace on the Bosphorus, or Black-Sea. Thus we may see how freely and frank∣ly the Turks Treated the Persians at this time; for now having secured the Peace with the Western Princes in Hungary, who were much more formidable at all times than the Eastern Nations: Howsoever, that no Advantages might be taken nei∣ther on that side, strict Commands and wise Instructions were sent to the Beilerbey of Gran Cairo, a Person of great Courage, Wisdom, and Experience, one of the Sul∣tan's Bed-Chamber, to take the Care and Charge of those Eastern Kingdoms, gi∣ving him also the Title of Seraskier, or General, and Beylerbey of Bagdat, or Baby∣lon, with Orders forthwith to form an Army with the People of the Country, and therewith to Attack Bassora, and drive out from thence the Rebellious Pasha, and set∣tle in his Place another Pasha Commissio∣nated by the Port to succeed in his Em∣ployment, with a Hattesheriff from the Sultan: But principally above all things it was recommended to him, to hinder and prevent all Incursions of Rebel Sulyman upon the Persians, who being good Friends to the Sultan, he could not permit, or suf∣fer, that they should receive any Affront, or Injury, from such as go under the De∣nomination of Subjects to the Port. But these Eastern Countries so far di∣stant as Persia, were not now the care of the Turks, whose Thoughts were wholly taken up in what manner they might finish the War with the Christians, which were divers; as with the Emperor, the Veneti∣ans, the Old and Irreconcileable Enemies to the Port; also with the Polanders, and Moscovites, the latter of which were not much known to the World, either for Friends, or Foes, tho' they began now un∣der the present Czar by the taking of Asac, and some other Actions, to make them∣selves known to the Turks, and other Na∣tions of the World. It being now resolved on all sides to make the Peace, the Mediators who were to manage the Treaty, were nominated and appointed, and the most proper Per∣sons esteemed to be the Ambassadors from England, and Holland, both of which ha∣ving never been Engaged in the War on any of the sides, but had always been true and ancient Friends to the Port, the Turks could have no Objections to alledge against either, nor had the Christian Princes any cause to suspect the Faith and Friendship of two such Ambassadors, whose Offices and Persons were acceptable to the Turks, and not displeasing to the Christians. The Names of these Ambassadors design∣ed to this so Necessary and Most Honour∣able Employment, were the Lord Paget, Ambassador for William King of Great-Britain; and the Heer Colyer, Ambassador for the Lords the States of the United Pro∣vinces. All Matters being now ripe for Action, and a willing mind for Execution, the Turks moved with their Camp on the 11th of June 1698. commanded by the Grand Vi∣zier, (the Grand Seignior still remaining behind in his Tent) and with them also moved the two Ambassadors with their Equipages: And to put every thing into a good posture, and a way of Dispatch, the Lord Ambassador's Secretary was dispatch∣ed away a second time, as he had been the first on the 10th of May for Vienna, from whence he returned on the 5th of July to Sophia; where on the same Day he there met with the Lord Ambassador Pa∣get, to whom he Communicated the good News of the Happy Inclinations of the Emperor and that Court towards the Peace: But that no delay should be made therein, the same Secretary was again dispatched a∣way, to hasten the Emperor's Ambassa∣dors to the Place appointed, and agreed up∣on for the Treaty, and to procure, and bring with him Passes, and safe Conducts for the Turkish Plenipotentiaries, who were the Reis Effendi, Chief Chancellor, or Se∣cretary; and Maurocordato, who was the principal and first Interpreter to the Grand Seignior. These two Persons, together with the Lord Paget, and the Dutch Ambassador, set out from Sophia before the Camp, on the 15th of July, and on the 24th they had pas∣sed 10 Hours beyond Nissa, and on the 31st they arrived happily at Belgrade. The Ambassadors remained at this place for the space of two Months; that is, of August and September, the which passed
soon away, in regard that the Expectati∣ons of Peace had so filled Mens Hearts, that nothing was heard in all Places but the Voices of Peace and Joy in all their Quarters. At length the Mouth of October being entered, the Proclamation of Neutrality was first published at Peter Waradin, to the great Pleasure and Satisfaction of all Peo∣ple, both Christians and Turks, and after∣wards at Belgrade. On the 9/19th of October, the Lord Paget, and the Dutch Ambassador left their Camp near the City, raised on an Eminence, where was a good Air, and a good Pro∣spect over the Countries round about; and upon the same Day early in the Morn∣ing they passed the Save, a River which runs from Bosnia, and falls into the Danube at Belgrade, where it loses its Name. In passing this River this Order was observed. First went an Allai-Bey, or the Marshal of the Show, with about 50 Horse. Then 60 Chiauses on Horseback. A Guard of Janisaries, being about 330 Men, all on Foot. An Aga belonging to the Ambassadors, with his own Servants, and six Domestick Janisaries. After which followed two Flags, one with the English Coat of Arms, and the other was a large Red Cross in a White Field. Then followed the English Ambassador's 6 led Horses covered with very rich Furniture, followed by the Gentleman of the Horse to my Lord Ambassador, attended by a Gio∣vane di Lingua, or a young Druggerman, or Interpreter. Then came up the two Interpreters at∣tending His Excellency the Lord Ambassa∣dor, on each side of his Horse, and they attended with two Heydukes in their own Country Habit; and on both sides 10 Chiohadars, or Servants, who carry the Cloaks, or Vests of the Great Men, in White Vests, with their Carbines on their Shoulders. The Brother to the Lord Ambassador road afterwards with six Chiohadars. Then followed the Secretary, and Do∣ctor, with two English Gentlemen; one from Aleppo, and the other from Tri∣poli. Also six Pages with the Lord Ambassa∣dor's Coach, with a Turkish one, which went before the Common Servants, who marched all on Horseback, two and two. At their Passage over the Bridge of the Save, which was lined with Janisaries, three Guns were fired from the Castle; and the Gallies, Saicks, and the Frigats as they passed fired eah a Gun. About half the way to Semblin, the Chi∣aus, and others, whom the Vizier had sent along with them, made a Halt, and having wished a good Journey to those whom they conducted, returned back. About an Hour after these Matters had passed, the Dutch Ambassador followed, and was used with the same Civility as those preceding. The Emperor's Ambassadors, because they sent Passports to the Turkish Ambas∣sadors Signed by the Emperor's Hand, de∣sired to have others Signed by the Sultan: But because it was considered that this ex∣change of Passports would take up a great deal of time, the Mediators found out, and agreed upon this Expedient, That the Pro∣clamation being made in both the Emperors Names, no Passports should be delivered, either from the Germans to the Turks, or from the Turks to the Germans; but that a Pleni-power should be given to the Midia∣tors to grant Passports to People, who were going up and down within the Limits of Neutrality agreed on both sides: So the German Ambassadors resolved to go to Car∣lowitz within three Days time, tho' their Wooden Houses were not arrived as yet. The Mediators also agreed upon the same, and to place themselves so, that their Doors might be over against each other at a good distance, whereby the Turks re∣mained wholly on the Belgrade side, and the Germans towards Peter Waradin. The 11/21st the Venetian Ambassador arri∣ved at Futack, but the Muscovite Ambassa∣dor, after their unthinking manner, came directly the same Day to Peter Waradin, without giving the Governour Notice of his coming; by which Neglect of the Moscovite, no Salutes were passed on him, of which he complained to the Governour; but that was easily answered, by saying, That he knew nothing of his coming down the River, and therefore hoped to be excu∣sed. In fine, To Accommodate this Matter, it was agreed, That the Boats of the Mos∣covites should remove from the place where they first Landed, and by a Signal given by the Ambassador's Trumpets, the Guns should be fired, which was done both from the Castle, the Town, and the Fleet.
On the 15/25th of this Month of October, the Turkish Ambassadors arrived at two Hours distance from the Tents of the Me∣diators; but both sides having considered, that the Days being short, and that at such a distance from the Quarters of the Pleni∣potentiaries, much time would be spent and lost in going to and fro, it was con∣cluded, That the English and Dutch Am∣bassadors should go to Carlowitz, and the Germans and Allies should take their Quar∣ters about half an Hour above them to∣wards Peter Waradin, and the Turks about a Quarter of an Hour below towards Bel∣grade. Upon the Arrival of the Mediators at Carlowitz, they were received by the Ger∣man Horse and Foot, and a Captain-Lieu∣tenant and a Standard, with 50 Horse, and also with another Captain-Lieutenant, and an Ensign, with 70 Foot, which were ap∣pointed to each Ambassador for the Medi∣ators Guards. The Turkish Soldiers were at the Right of the English Ambassador, and at the Left of the Dutch. On the 20/30th the Plenipotentiaries were showed to each other; and shortly after the Conferences began; but first the Pre∣parations were making for building the House for Conferences: But in the mean time to supply that Convenience, a great Tent was rais'd in the midst of that void place which was between the Tents of the Mediators; where it was farther ordered, That instead of Chambers for the several Parties, there should be Tents pitched on both sides. Some Points were here projected to be agreed on, as Preliminaries regulating the Ceremonies of the Congress; about which the Poles gave some trouble at the begin∣ning, who seemed rather to hinder than to forward the Peace; for the Disputes they made upon nothing, took up seven Days time; the which being at length o∣vercome, Octob. 26. O.S.On the 6th of November, N.S. all the Preliminary Points were adjusted, and a∣greed by all the Allies,Novemb. which tended chief∣ly to prevent and avoid all Contests about Precedence, and the disannulling all use∣less Ceremonies, during the Congress, as well as those Impediments which might cause Confusion and Disturbance. The Articles for Facilitating the Negotiation, were these. I. TO take away Notifications, and Visits of Ceremony and Precedence. II. That every Plenipotentiary shall advance his own Business, without being obliged to stay for one another, which in that case is to be put into the Hands of the Mediators, until the time that the General Subscription is made. III. That no Plenipotentiary shall hinder or delay the Progress of the Treaty; but that every one shall endeavour to assist each other in re∣moving the Difficulties which obstruct the way. IV. For confirming the District of Neutrality, and covering the several Ambassadors, and their Retinues from Insults and Wrongs, both during their Abode at the place of Treaty, and their Departure thence. V. And for keeping the Train and Domesticks of each Ambassador in order, and that no Di∣sturbance, or Quarrel might arise between them, it was Ordered, VI. That a Prohibition should be given to eve∣ry one to stir Abroad at Night; and that whosoever should be caught Abroad after the Sun was Set, should be kept in the Custody of the Guards until Morning, and then to be delivered into the Hands of the Ambassador to whom he belongs, to be punished. The Points were Signed and Sealed by the Ambassadors at Carlowitz, the 26th of October, or the 6th of November, N.S.
On the 2/13 of November, the Ambassador from the Emperor, appeared in the Camp of Carlovitz; as also did those from the Sultan, who placed themselves on both sides, not far from the House appointed for the Conferences to be held, and not far from the Places where the Mediators had their Lodgings, in which void Places several Magnificent and Stately Tents were erected; at which, about nine of the Clock in the Morning, the Emperor's Ambassa∣dor arrived, being attended with four Coaches of State, and a Numerous Re∣tinue. And in the first place they went to the Tents of the Mediators, where at the same time appeared the Turkish Ambassador, attended with a very stately Retinue of Cavaliers, well mounted on Horses of the finest Shapes that could be found in all Quarters of the Eastern World, and be∣sides their Cloathing which was very rich, they made as beautiful an Appearance, as the Germans had done before them: And both Parties at the same time presented themselves before the Mediators, in the Tent appointed for the Conferences: Where after the Salutations, and Comple∣ments on both sides, sufficiently Courte∣ous and Obliging, they took their Seats in the middle of the Tent, purposely set, and laid for them, one directly against the o∣ther, in such a manner, that no Person could take Exception against his Place, or Seat appointed for him. This being agreed and setled, the first Conference began, which was to determine this Great and Solemn Peace, which was the first of this kind, that ever passed be∣tween the Christians and the Turks; not but that several Treaties and Conclusions of Articles had passed before, but not on such equal Terms, and with so much Ho∣nour, and Deference given to Christian Mediators, which will be recorded in all Ages, to the Glory of William the Third, King of Great-Britain, and of the States-General, His Worthy and Wise Al∣lies. Nor will it be less Memorable in Ho∣nour of that Noble and Ancient Family of the Lord Paget; who with the Heer Colyer, Ambassador from the Lords the States-Ge∣neral of the United Provinces, bore so great a share in this Everlasting, and never to be forgotten Treaty. The Tent appointed for this Congress had four Doors, which fronted each other, at one of which entered the Imperial Am∣bassador, and at the opposite thereunto en∣tered the Turkish; and at the two others, which were likewise opposite, entered the Mediators. The Imperial Ambassador, was Named the Most Excellent Lord the Count of Ot∣tingen: And on the Turkish side was the Reis Effendi, which I take to be principal Secretary of State with us. Behind the Emperor's Ambassador the Secretary of the Embassy was placed; as also at a small Table behind the English Mediator, was placed the English Secreta∣ry: And behind the Ottoman Ambassador the Turkish Secretary, called Mauro Cordato, by Extraction a Greek, and of that Rite, or Religion; he stood a while behind the Turkish Ambassador upon his Legs, but af∣terwards was ordered to sit on the Ground after the Turkish Fashion; both which Se∣cretaries took the Minutes, or Protocollo of what was propounded, or what pas∣sed. The Doors of the Tent was on all sides guarded equally by Germans and Turks, and both filled up the Doors of the Tent, amongst which were many Commanding Officers, who had room sufficient to see every thing that passed: The Conferences began commonly about ten a Clock, or half an Hour past ten in the Morning, and lasted until half an Hour past two in the Afternoon: And then ended the first Day of Conference. On the 4/14th the Imperial Ambassador dispatched a Messenger by way of Peter Waradin towards the Places where the Re∣giment of Corbelli, and the two Battalions of Anhalt, and Turcheim, were Quartered, which were setled there for Guards near to the Congress; as also for the same rea∣son had appointed 200 Horse of the first Rank, and 100 Foot of the second: Like∣wise the Turkish Ministers remanded to Bel∣grade as many of their People, as they could well spare. The same Day that this Exchange was made, the Plenipotentiaries from the Sul∣tan not being used to sit upon Stools, or Chairs, but very uneasily, caused a Safraw to be placed for them, covered with rich Carpets, and Embroidered Cushions, upon which they sate Cross-legg'd after the Turkish Fashion. After which the Company rising, the Imperial Ambassador went to Dinner with the Mediators, where having remained for the space of about two Hours, they returned to the Conference about three a Clock, which continued until half an Hour past four in the Evening.
The next Day being the 5/15, the Impe∣rial Ambassador appeared at the place of the Conference in most Rich and Pompous Habit in Honour to the Day, which was the Emperor's Birth-Day; and which af∣ter the Conference was ended, was ho∣noured with a most splendid and stately Dinner, and Entertainment. The 6/18 the Plenipotentiaries again as∣sembled about ten a Clock in the Morn∣ing, which continued with much diligence until eight a Clock in the Evening. The 7/17th the Venetian Ambassador came for the first time with a most splendid E∣quipage to the Conference, in which that whole Day was entirely spent. On the 7/17th, the Turks made a Proposi∣tion to have the Principality of Transylva∣nia to be restored to its pristine State and Condition, but so as to remain under the Emperor's Protection; but this Point was positively rejected by the Imperialists, the which not taking. On the 11/21, the Turks made another Of∣fer about this Principality, leaving it wholly in the Power and Possession of the Emperor, stipulating howsoever, That an Honorary Tribute should be paid unto the Port for the same, but this was likewise rejected by the Imperialists: For the truth is, the Emperor would hearken to nothing which could give the Turks any Footing or Demand upon Transylvania, which is the Entrance, and the Lock and Key into the Upper Hungary, and into Germany it self. So on the 14/24, after long Debates on both sides, the Point of Transylvania was agreed in the same manner as proposed by the Germans. The 15/25th was entirely spent upon the Argument of the Limits, in which things were so prepared, that On the 16/16th a good progress was made about the Regulation of the Confines; and before they arose, or separated for that E∣vening, it was agreed, which of the other Allies should have their Business come next to the Conference, and was agreed, That it should be the Venetians, which was the more easily assented unto, because they had agreed with the Imperialists to treat upon the Foot of Uti Possidetis. Accordingly on the 17/17, the Venetian Ambassadors met the Turks, and had a long Conference with them, but the Turks ma∣king some new Demands, which the Am∣bassadors not being prepared to answer, or to gratifie them in, it ended for that Day without any Determination. The 18/28th, the Venetians renewed their former Conference, where the same Diffi∣culties offering and not removed, all end∣ed again without any farther positive Re∣solution. The 19/29 the Moscovite Ambassador went to Conference, in which having held a Discourse only in general Terms, without entering upon Particulars, nothing was concluded, or determined for that Day. The 20/30 was spent by the Mediators in going between the Plenipotentiaries to dis∣pose them towards the ultimate Agree∣ment. The 21st of November, or first of De∣cember, the Imperialists had a Conference with the Turks in the Morning, at which they proceeded yet farther in adjusting and setling the Limits of each Empire: And the same Day in the Afternoon the Polish Ambassador went to Conference; at which his Discourse was loose and general, so that nothing was concluded for that time. The next Day being the 22d of Novem∣ber, or the 2d of December, the Moscovite Ambassador had another Conference with the Turks, who pretended the Cession, or Demolition of the Places Conquered by the Czar, but that Demand was rejected, the Ambassador saying, That he would nei∣ther give unto, nor take any thing from the Turks; but that his Master required the Fortress of Keres from the Cham of Tar∣tary. The 23d of November, or the 3d of De∣cember, the Ambassador of Poland began to abate, and remit something of his high Demands, which gave some hopes of an Accommodation between the Poles and the Turks, in case an Equivalent could be found for the Town and Fortress of Ca∣minieck. The 24/4 in the Afternoon the Venetian Ambassador had a Conference which lasted until Night, but could come to no satisfa∣ctory Resolution; the Turks still adhering
to their Demands, that several places should be razed, which are in the Possessi∣on of the Venetians, which the Ambassa∣dor alledged that he had not power to grant. The 25/5th the Polish Ambassador went again to Conference, after which, it was observed, That the Turks dispatch∣ed an Express Courier to the Port there∣upon. The 26/6 in the Afternoon, the Imperia∣lists went again to Conference, but con∣cluded nothing for that time. The 28/8 the Imperialists had another Conference with the Turks, which held from nine a Clock in the Morning, till five in the Afternoon; during which time the Articles between the Emperor and the Sul∣tan were for the most part agreed. The 29/9th the Imperial Ambassador held another Conference with the Turks, but that Day was for the most part spent in Debates without any conclusion. The 30/10th my Lord Paget went to the Ottoman Ambassador in the Morning, and to the Imperialists in the Afternoon, en∣deavouring to dispose both Parties to a Peace. December 1/11th the Imperial Ambassador had this Day the tenth Conference with the Turks, at which the remaining Articles were debated and agreed, so that little or nothing was wanting to perfect the Em∣peror's Treaty. On the 2/12th the Moscovite Ambassador was at Conference from 10 a Clock to 12 at Noon: At which the Turks required the Demolition, and Restitution of Dogan Ca∣lusi, and three other Forts which the Czar holds upon the Boristhenes, to which the Moscovites would give no ear; howsoever they relinquished their Pretensions upon Keres; so that it was not doubted but that a Medium might now be easily found to compose Matters remaining. The 3/13th was spent by the Mediators in trying to rectifie some Mistakes and Misunderstandings which might remove some Difficulties. The 4/14th the Polish Ambassador was at Conference, at which four Articles were drawn and agreed unto. In one of which there was yielded unto the Turks the Castles which the Poles then had, and possessed in Moldavia. In another, it was agreed, That in Ex∣change for those Castles, the strong For∣tress of Caminieck, and the Provinces of Podolia, and Ukrania, should be Surren∣dered into the Hands of the Poles. The 5/15 was spent in preparing Matters for a farther Progress. The 6/16 the Imperialists went to Confe∣rence with an Intention to reduce the Ar∣ticles which were already agreed, into or∣der, but the Turks not having fully finished the Translation of them, it was deferred to another Convention. On the 7/17th, the Moscovite delivered in∣to the Hands of my Lord Paget, the Arti∣cles which he had promised to consign to the Mediation. And accordingly on the 8/18th, he sent a Supplement thereunto, which did not an∣swer expectation, so that Business remain∣ed for some time undetermined. The next Day 9/19 the Polish Ambassador had another Conference with the Turks, at which the remaining Points of the Treaty were agreed upon; so that in a manner that whole Peace was agreed, and fini∣shed. The 10/20th of December, the Venetian Ambassador communicated a new Com∣mission, and Project which he had received from the State of Venice to the Media∣tors. And in the Afternoon the Moscovite Am∣bassador entertained a Discourse with the Mediators, and Mauro Cordato, but at that Meeting they cleared no Business. With these frequent Conferences on all sides, much time passed away, until Christ∣mas approached, and then was the Season that Labours should give place to Devoti∣on and Mirth, and to the Solemnities of that Festival, which continued until the Twelve Days were over; and then all sides began again, after the Plenipotentia∣ry Ambassadors had passed their time very Jovially, to renew again their Treaties: Only the Turkish Ambassadors having lit∣tle to do with the Christian Rites, wished heartily that the Feasts were over, and pressed heartily for an end thereof; al∣ledging, That their Presence was required at the Port, and that the Sultan would no longer allow of their Absence.
The first that betook himself to Busi∣ness, (which was strange) was the Mosco∣vite Ambassador, who on the 14/24th of Ja∣n sary 1699, was the first who Subscribed the Instrument of Amnesty, and the Trea∣ties of the Peace of the Emperor, and Po∣land, with the Port, were Signed on the 16/26th by their Ambassadors: And the Ve∣netian Treaty being very well adjusted and perfected, all Parties appeared to be very well satisfied; and the Venetian Ambassa∣dor as well as the others, tho' for want of sufficient Power, he could not then Sign his Instrument, but supposed that Orders would come to him for doing the same, be∣fore the Imperial Ratifications, which were to be exchanged on the Line of Limits be∣tween Peter Waradin, and Belgrade, could be dispatched, in which case the Media∣tors had Power to receive it. Monday the 16/26 of January was appointed for the Solemn Day of Signature. Monday the 16/26th of January, was the So∣lemn Day of Signature, the which having been passed in the Morning, all the Am∣bassadors, Turks as well as Christians, with all their Attendants, Guards, &c. with many Persons of Quality out of the Coun∣try, making about 5000 Persons, Dined at my Lord Paget's Quarters, at whose Table, the King of England's Health was the first that was drank, then the Empe∣ror's, and the lasting Continuance of the Peace, which was Signed that very Day: And then we may believe, and fansie, that most People there present were all heartily Merry, with as much Solemnity as that Place could afford: And amongst other things of Mirth it was observed, That my Lord Paget had an Oxe Roasted whole for the Soldiers, a thing never known be∣fore in those Parts. On the 17/27th, the Mediators Dined with the Emperor's Ambassadors, where they were entertained with the like Rejoycings, and in the Evening with Fire-Works, Foun∣tains of Wine, Drums, Trumpets, Mu∣sick, and with the Discharge of Great and Small Guns. The 18/28th, the Moscovite Ambassador took his leave of my Lord Paget, with many Lofty Expressions of Civility and Acknowledgments. The 19/29th, my Lord Paget Visited the Imperial Ambassadors, as he did the Turks on the 20/30th, and 21/31st, which was in return of that Compliment which the Turks had made to him some time after the first Conferences. The 21st of January, or the first of Fe∣bruary, the Turks were to visit the Imperial Ambassadors, and to take their leaves of them. On the 24/3th, the Imperialists were to take their Leaves of the Turks, and return their Visit. And on the 24/4th or 25/5th in the Morn∣ing, the Mediators, and Turks, design∣ed to take their Journey towards Bel∣grade, where the Mediators were to con∣tinue until the Exchange of the Ratifica∣tions. The 26th at Night, O.S. the Polish Am∣bassador departed by the Post, after ha∣ving passed many high Complements on my Lord Pagett, expressing the Transport he was in, for the Successful Assistances he had received from His Excellency in the Management and Conclusion of his Busi∣ness. The Muscovite Ambassador also declared, That he would leave Peter Waradin on the 2/12th of February; and in three or four Days after which, the Mediators declared, That the Place of Congress was likely to be quite cleared. The House of Conference was bestow∣ed by Count Ottingen on the Franciscan Fryars, who at the same time declared, That their Intentions were to make a Church thereof, in memory of that Peace which had been there transacted. For which God be praised; which be∣ing of a High Concernment to all Chri∣stendom, and to which the knowledge of the particular Articles may be useful to all Nations, we have thought fit to add them hereunto in Latin and English, as here fol∣loweth.
INSTRUMENTUM PACIS Caesareo-Ottomanicum, Subscriptum Januarii 26. 1699. AD perpetuam rei memoriam, Notum sit omnibus & singulis, quorum interest, posteaquam per sedecim hucusque anno saevum, exitiale, & multâ humani Sanguinis effu∣sione cruentum adeò bellum, cum pluri∣marum Provinciarum desolatione gestum esset inter Serenissimum, & Potentissimum Principem & Dominum Leopoldum; Ele∣ctum Romanorum Imperatorem semper Augustum, Germaniae, Hungariae, Bohe∣miae, Dalmatiae, Croatiae, Sclavoniae Re∣gem, Archiducem Austriae, Ducem Bur∣gundiae, Brabantiae, Styriae, Carinthiae, Carniolae, Marchionem Moraviae, Ducem Luxemburgiae, Superioris & Inferioris Si∣lesiae, Wirtembergae, & Teckae, Principem Sueviae, Comitem Habspurgi, Tyrolis, Kyburgi & Gotitiae, Marchionem Sacri Romani Imperii, Burgoviae, ac Superioris & Inferioris Lusatiae, Dominum Marchiae Sclavinicae, Portus Naonis & Salinarum, &c. ab una: Et Serenissimum, atque Po∣tentissimum Principem & Dominum Sul∣tanum Mustapha Han Ottomannorum Im∣peratotem, ac Asiae & Graeciae ejusque glo∣riosos Praedecessores ab altera parte, miser∣tique tandem afflictae Subditorum Sortis summè dicti ambo Potentissimi Impera∣tores finem tantis in perniciem Generis Humani indies augescentibus malis ponere, seriò in animum induxissent, factum Di∣vinâ bonitate esse, ut annitentibus, & Conciliantibus Serenissimo, & Potentissimo Principe, & Domino Guillielmo Tertio, Magnae Britanniae, Franciae, & Hiberniae Rege, uti & Celsis ac Praepotentibus Do∣minis Ordinibus Generalibus Unitarum Bel∣gii Provinciarum Solennes ea de causa Tractatus Carlovizii in Sirmio propè Con∣finia utriusque Imperii instituti atque ad finem perducti fuerint.

I. REGIO Transylvaniae, quemadmo∣dum, de praesenti est in possessione, & potestatate Caes. Majestatis, ita maneat in ejusdem Dominio: Et à Podoliae con∣finio, usque ad extremum Vallachiae Con∣finium, suis Montibus, qui antiqui fue∣runt limites ante praesens bellum inter Transylvaniam ex una parte, & Moldavi∣am atque Vallachiam ex alia parte, atque à Confinio Vallachiae usque ad Flumen Marusum, pariter suis Montibus, qui an∣tiqui fuerunt limites, circumscribatur, & sic utrinque observatis antiquis Limitibus, nec ultrà nec citrà ab utroque Imperio fieri possit extensio. II. Provincia Subjecta Arci Temeswarinen∣si cum omnibus fuis districtibus, & inter∣fluentibus Fluviis maneat in possessione, & potestate Excelsi imperii Ottomannici, at∣que à parte Transylvaniae fines ejus sint ab extremo confinio Vallachiae usque ad Flu∣vium Marusium in Superiori Articulo con∣stituti Transylvaniae antiqui Limites. Tum à parte Marusii usque ad Fluvium Tibis∣cum citerioribus ripis ejusdem Marusii, & à parte Tibisci usque ad Danubium ci∣terioribus ripis Fluvii Tibisci fines ejus li∣mitentur: Quae vero intra praedictos li∣mites sita sunt loca, nempe Caransebes, Lugos, Lippa, Csanad, Kiscanisia, Betsche, Betskerech, & Sablia citerius & intra prae∣constitutos ante praesens bellum praedecla∣ratam rationem intra ripas Fluminum Ma∣rusii & Tibisci in Temeswarinensibus Ter∣ritoriis, qualiscunque alius similis locus reperiatur, eâ conditione destruantur per Caesareos, ut vi Pactorum amplius reaedi∣ficari non possint: Et praedicta Regio Temeswarinensis omnino libera relinqua∣tur, & imposterum neque in dictis hisce locis, neque prope ripas Fluviorum Ma∣rusii atque Tibisci alia vel majora vel mi∣nora loca, quae possint Speciem Fortifica∣tionis exhibere, exstruantur. Fluviorum Marusiii ac Tibisci inter Pro∣vinciam Temeswarinensem, & Provincias Caesareae potestati, & possessioni subjectas usus sit communis Subditis utriusque im∣perii, tum ad potum pecorum omnis ge∣neris, tum ad piscationem, & alias com∣moditates Subditis perquam necessarias. Cum verò onerariae Naves à partibus Superioribus Subjectis Caesareo Dominio, tum per Marusium Fluvium in Tibiscum, tum per Tibiscum in Danubium, sive as∣cendendo sive descendendo ultrò citroque meantes nullo obice praepediri debeant, navigatio Navium Germanicarum, aut ali∣orum Subditorum Caesareorum, nullo mo∣do possit in cursu suo ultrò citróque incom∣modari, sed liberè atque commodissimè fiat ubique in praedictis duobus Fluviis: Et si quidem reciprocae amicitiae & mutuae benevolentiae convenientia id etiam requi∣rat, ut Subditi imperiali Ottomanicae po∣testati subjecti possint usûs praedictorum Fluviorum esse participes, sine impedi∣mento Navibus piscatoriis etiam ac Cym∣bis utantur. Molendinariae autem Naves in locis tan∣tum, quibus Navigationi alterius, nempe Caesarei Dominii, nullatenus impedimen∣to esse possint, communicatione Guberna∣torum utriusque Dominii, & consensu po∣nantur: quinimò ne diversione aquarum in Marusio cursus Caesarearum Navium in∣commodum aliquod patiatur, nullatenus permittetur, ut sive Molendinorum, sive alia occasione ex Marusio aquae alio deri∣ventur seu diducantur. Insulae quaecunque in praedictis Fluviis, cum actu sint in potestate Caesarea, ma∣neant, uti possidentur: & subditi utrius∣que Dominii omnino pacificè atque tran∣quillè vivant, Severissimisque Edictis ab insolentiis, & contraventione Pactorum contineantur. III. Cum Regio inter Fluvios Tibiscum, & Danubium vulgò dicta Batska sit in sola possessione & potestate Caesareae Majesta∣tis, sic maneat deinceps etiam in praefata potestate, & Dominio Caesareo, neque Titelium magis quam in praesenti est, for∣tificetur. IV. Ab extrema ripa citeriore Tibisci, op∣posita Titelianae ripae & angulo terrae ibi∣dem per conjunctionem Tibisci, & Da∣nubii terminato deducatur linea recta us∣que in ripam Danubii: Item è regione citerioris ripae Tibiscanae sitam, & ulterius protrahatur pariter recta ad Moravizii ri∣pam citeriorem amnis Bossut, & inde ad locum usque ubi praedictus amnis Bossut principali alveo in Savum illabitur: & Mo∣ravizio sine ulla Fortificatione relicto, ex∣structisque tantùm in opposita utrinque ripa, apertis pagis, separentur per prae∣dictam lineam firmatam atque distinctam sive fossis, sive lapidibus, sive palis, sive aliâ ratione Imperia sequenti mode: Regio Versus Belgradinum intra modò dictos li∣mites permaneat sub sola potestate Poten∣tissimi
Ottomannorum Imperatoris: Regio vero extra praedictam lineam sita, maneat sub sola potestate & possessione Potentissi∣mi! Romanorum Imperatoris: & secun∣dùm praedictos limites pariter possidean∣tur Fluvii qui sunt Territoriis permanenti∣bus in possessione utriusque partis. V. Ab ostio amnis Bossut in Savum efflu∣entis usque item in Savum elabentis Un∣nae Fluvii ostium Savi altera quidem pars pertinens ad Ditionem Caesaream possi∣deatur ab ejus Majestate, altera verò pars possideatur ab Imperatore Ottoman∣norum. Interfluens Fluvius Savus, & Insulae in hoc communi tractu sitae, sint communes, & usus tum ad Navigationem ultrò citró∣que, tum ad alias commoditates utriusque partis Subditis pariter communis sit, u∣triusque religiosè observantibus, pacificum, & imperturbatum ultrò citróque commer∣cium; Usque ad Unnam Fluvium Regio pettinens ad Dominium Imperialis Otto∣mannicae Majestatis, quâ Bosniam spectat, citerioribus ripis Unnae Fluvii definiatur atque terminetur evacuatis Novi, Dubiz∣za, Jessenovizza, Doboy, & Brod ex parte Bosnensi: & qualicunque alio simili loco in hoc Tractu existente, & deductis inde Praesidiis Caesareis, ista pars omni modo libera relinquatur: Castanoviz au∣tem, & insulae infra Terram Novi versùs Savum cum ulterioribus ripis ejusdem Unnae, cum sint & maneant in potestate Romanorum Imperatoris, praedictis limi∣tibus hinc distinguantur. Loca demum ultra Unnam longè à Sa∣vo sita, & ab utraque parte Praesidiis conservata atque possessa cum Terris ante praesens bellum ad eadem spectantibus, maneant iterum in potestate utriusque possidentis partis, ea Conditione, ut Com∣missarii utrinque mox deputandi Distri∣ctus atque Territoria singulatim deductis particularibus lineis separantes, per fos∣sas, lapides, palos, aut aliâ quacunque ratione, ad evitandam confusionem posita Signa, segregent atque disjungant, in partibus Croatiae usque ad ultimum Con∣finium, & terminum locorum in utriusque Dominii possessione permansurorum. Et ex utraque parte, si quis ausus fue∣rit alterare, mutare, evellere, tollere, aut quovis modo violare aliquod ex praedictis Signis, ille per omnimodam inquisitio∣nem deprehensus ad exemplum aliorum severissimè puniatur. Commissariis verò ad distinctionem, & positionem limitum in isto confinio quoad fieri poterit, quàm celerrimè deputandis Regiis Edictis demandetur, ut ad Tran∣quillitatem, & Securitatem Subditorum utriusque Dominii sedulo animum adhi∣bentes sine controversia, & sine quacun∣que particulari complacentia Terras optimè separent, atque manifestè distinguant. Cùm siti in altera Savi parte, qua Do∣minium Imperiale Ottomannicum recipit, munimenti Brod Fortificationes utpote re∣center à Militiis Caesareis factae, tempore educendi Praesidii Caesarei, everti debeaut, locus autem ille sit commodissimus ad Mercaturam, poterit ibidem erigi cum honesto & commodo recinctu civitas, ita tamen ut in Arcis aut Munimenti formam non redigatur. VI. Definiti tandem per hosce Tractatus, & subsecutâ, ubi opus fuerit, locali Depu∣tatorum Commissariorum separatione sta∣biliti, sive deinceps idoneo tempore per operam Commissariorum utrinque stabili∣endi Confiniorum limites sanctè utrinque, & religiosè observentur, ita ut sub nulla ratione aut praetextu extendi, transferri, aut mutuari possint: neque liceat alicui paci∣scentium parti in alterius partis Territorium ultra statutos semel terminos, aut lineas quidquam Juris aut potestatis praetendere aut exercere, aut alterius partis Subditos sive ad deditionem, sive ad pendendum tri∣butum qualecumque, sive praeteritum, sive futurum, sive ad quamvis aliam humano ingenio excogitabilem exactionis aut vexa∣tionis speciem adigere aut molestare, sed omnis altercatio juste amoveatur. VII. Licitum & liberum esto utrique partium pro confiniorum suorum securitate quo∣cunque meliori visum fuerit modo, arces, munimenta, & loca per praesentes Tracta∣tus pacifice possessa, quaecunque de facto extant, reparare, munire, & fortificare, exceptis illis, de quibus utrinque nomina∣tim cautum est; ad Incolarum verò com∣modas habitationes in extremis Confiniis apertos pagos aedificare ubique sine im∣pedimento & sine exceptione utrique parti liceat, dummodo sub hoc praetextu Forta∣litia non erigantur. VIII. Incursiones hostiles, & occupationes, omnesque insultus clam aut ex improviso facti devastationes, & depopulationes Territorii utriusque Dominii omnino, & severissimis Mandatis prohibitae sint ac il∣licitae:
transgressores verò articuli hujus ubicunque deprehensi statim incarceren∣tur, & per Jurisdictionem loci, ubi cap∣tivati fuerint, pro merito puniantur absque ulla remissione, & rapta quaecunque sint diligentissimè perquisita, & adinventa, cum omni aequitate Dominis suis resti∣tuantur: Capitanei quoque ipsimet, Com∣mendantes, & Praefecti utriusque partis ad justitiam nullâ admissâ injuriâ in∣tegerrimè administrandam sub amissione officii non solum, sed etiam vitae, & honoris adstricti sint, atque obligati. IX. Maneat porrò etiam illicitum futu∣ris quoque temporibus, receptaculum vel fomentum dare malis Hominibus, re∣bellibus Subditis, aut malè contentis, sed ejusmodi Homines, & omnes prae∣dones, raptores, etiamsi alterius partis Subditi sint, quos in ditione sua depre∣henderint, merito supplicio afficere, utra∣que pars adstricta sit: qui si deprehen∣di nequeant, Capitaneis aut Praefectis eorum, sicubi eos latitare compertum fuerit, indicentur, iique illos puniendi Mandatum habeant: quod si nec hi officio suo in punitione talium scelera∣torum satisfecerint, indignationem Impe∣ratoris sui incurrant, aut officiis exuan∣tur, aut ipsimet poenas pro reis luant: Quoque magis nefariorum hujusmodi petulantiis cautum sit, neutri partium liceat intertenere, & alere Haydones, quos liberos nuncupant, Plagiarios Pri∣beck dictos, atque id genus facinoroso∣rum Hominum, qui non sunt alteru∣trius Principis stipendio conducti sed rapto vivunt, tamque ii quam qui eos aluerint, pro demerito puniantur; ta∣lesque nefarii, etiamsi consuetae vitae emendationem prae se ferant, nullam fidem mereantur nec prope confinia toleren∣tur, sed ad alia remotiora loca transfe∣rantur. X. Cum tempore praesentis hujus belli plures ex Hungaris & Transylvanis à Subjectione suae Caesareae Majestatis secedentes ad Consinia Excelsi Imperii sese receperint, atque hac in parte eti∣am conclusae per inducias inter utrumque imperium almae huic Paci debitis modis in futuram securitatem providendum sit, de praedictis ita pactum est, ut in diti∣onibus antè nominati Excelsi Imperii ad lubitum possint locari & accommodari: Ne tamen aliquo modo Consiniorum tranquillitas, & Subditorum quies per∣turbari queat, loca ubi praedicti colloca∣buntur, remota sint ab omnibus limita∣neis, & confiniariis partibus, & uxoribus illorum dabitur facultas sequendi mari∣tos suos, iisque in Imperatorio assigna∣to ad hoc districtum cohabitandi. Cum∣que imposterum in reliquos Subditos Po∣tentissimi Ottomannorum Imperatoris an∣numerandi veniant, non liceat illis à sub∣jectione ejusdem amplius recedere, & si qui recesserint, atque ad Patriam iterum reverti voluerint, in numero & conditione malevolorum recenseantur, neque illis à Caesareis fomentum aut receptaculum praebeatur, quinimo deprehensi Ottoman∣nis Confiniorum Gubernatoribus extra∣dantur, quo magis utrinque securitati Pacis prospiciatur. XI. Ad tollendas penitus quascunque in Confiniis super aliquo articulorum Ar∣mistitii hujus aut quavis de re imposte∣rum enascentes controversias, differenti∣as, aut discordias, ubi prompto & ma∣turo remedio opus sit ordinentur utrin∣que in Confiniis primo quoque tempore electi pari numero Commissarii viri neu∣tiquam avidi, sed graves, probi, pru∣dentes, experti, atque pacifici: Hique loco opportuno convenientes sine exer∣citu cum aequali pacificarum personarum comitiva, omnes & singulas hujusmodi controversias emergentes, audiant, cog∣noscant, decidant, & amicabiliter com∣ponant, talem denique ordinem, & mo∣dum constituant, quo utraque pars suos Homines, & Subditos citra omnem Ter∣giversationem vel praetextum gravissimis poenis ad sinceram ac firmam pacis ob∣servantiam compellat. Quod si verò ne∣gotia tanti momenti occurrerent, quae per Commissarios utriusque partis componi & expediri non possent, tunc ad ambos Potentissimos Imperatores remittantur, ut ipsi complanandis iisdem, sedandis, & extinguendis modum & rationem inve∣nire & adhibere valeant, ita, ut tales controversiae quàm fieri poterit intra bre∣vissimum temporis spatium componantur, nec earum resolutio ullâ ratione negliga∣tur, aut protrahatur. Cúmque praeterea in antecedentibus Sacris Capitulationibus duella, & mutuae ad certamen provocationes fuerint veti∣tae, imposterum etiam sint illicitae; & si qui ad singulare certamen venire ausi fuerint, in illos ut transgressores gravis∣simè animadvertatur.
XII. Captivi tempore praesentis belli ex utraque parte in captivitatem abacti, & in publicis carceribus adhuc superstites, cùm occasione istius almae Pacis elibera∣tionem tandem aliquando meritò sperent, nec possint sine laesione Majestatis Impe∣ratoriae, & laudatae consuetudinis in ea∣dem Captivitatis miseria, & calamitate relinqui: usitatis ab antiquo, vel ho∣nestioribus adhuc rationibus, per com∣mutationem in libertatem asserantur, & si plures, aut melioris conditionis in una quam in altera parte invenientur, pro reliquorum etiam eliberatione, quando Solennes legati instantias afferent, gra∣tiosa, & huic almae Paci conveniens u∣triusque Imperatoris pietas nequaquam denegetur: Caeteris verò, qui in priva∣torum potestate sunt, vel apud ipsos Tartaros, licitum sit eliberationem suam honesto, &, quam fieri poterit, mediocri lytro procutare; quòd si cum Captivi Domino honesta accommodatio fieri non poterit, Judices locorum litem omnem per compositionem dirimant: Sin autem praedictis viis id etiam confici haud pos∣set, Captivi pretiis eorum sive per te∣stimonia, sive per juramenta probatis at∣que solutis eliberentur. Nec possint Do∣mini aviditate majoris lucri sese redem∣ptioni eorundem opponere, & quando∣quidem ex parte Excelsi Imperii Otto∣mannici Homines non emitterentur, qui taliter eliberandis Captivis operam ad∣hibeant, spectabit ad probitatem Caesa∣reorum Praefectorum, ut ad dimittendum Ottomannos Captivos, quo empti sunt pretio sincere liquidato, Dominos illo∣rum adstringant, atque ita Sanctum hoc opus pari utrinque pietate promoveatur: quousque demùm Captivi utrinque prae∣dictae ratione eliberentur, legati Pleni∣potentiarii ex utraque parte officia sua adhibebunt, ut interea miseri Captivi be∣nignè tractentur. XIII. Pro Religiosis, ac Religionis Christi∣anae exercitio juxta ritum Romanum Catholicae Ecclesiae, quaecunque praece∣dentes gloriosissimi Ottomannorum Impe∣ratores in Regnis suis sive per antece∣dentes Sacras Capitulationes, sive per signa Imperialia, sive per Edicta, & Mandata Specialia favorabiliter concesse∣runt, ea omnia Serenissimus, & Poten∣tissimus Ottomannorum Imperator im∣posterum etiam observanda confirmabit, ita ut Ecclesias suas praefati Religiosi reparare atque resarcire possint, functio∣nes suas ab antiquo consuetas exerceant, & nemini permissum sit, contra Sacras Capitulationes, & contra leges Divinas aliquo genere molestiae, aut pecuniariae petitionis eosdem Religiosos cujuscunque ordinis, & conditionis assicere, sed con∣suetae Imperatoriâ pietate gaudeant, & fruantur. Praeterea Serenissimi, & Poten∣tissimi Romanorum Imperatoris solenni ad fulgidam Portam legato licitum sit, commissa sibi circa Religionem, & loca Christianae Visitationis in Sancta Civi∣tate Jerusalem existentia exponere, at∣que instantias suas ad Imperiale solium afferre. XIV. Commercia juxta antecedentes etiam Sacras Capitulationes libera sint  que partis subditis, in omnibus Impe∣riorum Regnis, & Ditionibus; ut autem utrique parti utili ratione, & sine frau∣de, & dolo peragantur, inter Deputatos Commissarios rem mercatoriam bene in∣telligentes tempore solennium utrinque Legationum contractabitur, & sicuti cum aliis Excelsi Imperii amicis Nationibus observatum est, ita etiam subditi cujus∣cunque Nationis Caesareae Majestatis se∣curitate, & utilitate Commerciorum in Regnis Excelsi Imperii idoneis modis, & usitatis Privilegiis gaudebunt, & per∣fruentur. XV. Quaecunque conditiones in antiquis Sacris Capitulationibus expressae sunt, nec praedictis Punctis hoc Tractatu sti∣pulatis, aut liberrimo cujusque possiden∣tium Dominio, & usui ejusdem adver∣santur, aut praejudicant, posthac etiam colantur sanctè, & observentur, cassatis & annullatis iis, quae supradictis quocunque modo repugnant. XVI. Ut quoque tantò magis Armistitium hoc bonáque inter ambos Potentissimos Imperatores amicitia firmetur, ac coales∣cat, mittentur Solennes utrinque legati ex quo usitatis caeremonialibus ab in∣troitu in Confinia usque ad reditum in locum secundae permutationis excipiendi, honorandi, tractandi atque prosequendi, qui in signum amicitiae Spontaneum munus, conveniens tamen, & utriusque Imperatoris dignitati consentaneum affe∣rent;
Et primâ aestate in mense Junio iter, praeviae mutuâ correspondentiâ, uno eodemque tempore suscipientes in Sirmi∣ensi confinio, more jam pridem inter u∣trumque imperium observato, permuta∣buntur. Solennibus porrò legatis in Im∣peratoriis Aulis, quidquid libuerit, petere liceat, ac permittatur. XVII. Regula, & norma Curialium in reci∣piendis receptisque pariter honorandis, & tractandis Ministris ultrò citróque commeantibus, & commorantibus juxta usitatam, prioribus etiam temporibus mo∣dalitatem deinceps ab utrinque cum aequa∣li decore, & secundum distinctam chara∣cteris missorum praerogativam observetur. Legatis Caesareis, & Residentibus, & qui∣busvis eorundem Hominibus pro suo arbitrio quibuscunque placuerit Vestibus uti licitum sit, néve quisquam impedi∣mento esse possit. Ministri porrò Caesa∣rei, sive oratoris, sive legati, sive Resi∣dentis, sive Agentis munere fungantur, quibus reliquorum Principum Fulgidae Portae amicorum legati, & Agentes im∣munitatibus, & Privilegiis perfruuntur eaedem libertate, imò ad distinguendam Caesareae dignitatis praerogativam usitatis melioribus modis fruantur, habeantque liberam potestatem conducendi interpre∣tes: Cursores etiam, & alii eorum Ho∣mines Viennâ ad Fulgidam Portam, atque iterum redeuntes, & ultrò citróque veni∣entes Salvo passu tutò, & securè per∣meent, atque ut commodè iter suum per∣ficiant, omni favore coadjuventur. XVIII. Pax ista quamvis secundum propositas conditiones conclusa, tum demum inte∣grum ex omni parte robur obligationis, & debitae observantiae vinculum accipiet & inducet, cum omnia, & singula, quae de Confiniis suprà recensito modo ultrò citróque promissa, & acceptata sunt, tam de distinctionibus limitum, quàm de eva∣cuationibus, & demolitionibus plenarie in effectum, & executionem deducta fue∣rint, ita ut absolutae designatione limi∣tum in unoquoque Confinio statim subse∣quatur demolitio, aut evacuatio, quod ut quam celerrimè succedat, designentur ad limites, & terminos Confiniorum ponen∣dos, & distinguendos, ex utraque parte Commissarii, qui die Aequinoctii, scilicet 22. mensis Martii, aut 12 secundum ve∣terem Stylum, Anni Millesimi Sexcente∣simi Nonagesimi noni in locis inter Com∣missarios consensu Gubernatorum utrius∣que Confinii determinandis, mediocri, & pacifico Comitatu conveniant, atque intra spatium duorum Mensium, si possibile sit, aut etiam citius, ubi fieri poterit, Confinia limitibus, & terminis manifestis per superiores articulos constitutis di∣stinguant, separent, determinent, & Sta∣tuta inter legatos Plenipotentiarios utri∣usque imperii accuratissimè, & citissimè exequantur. XIX. Has vero conditiones, & articulos ad formam hic mutuò placitam à Majestati∣bus utriusque Imperatoris ratihabitum iri, atque ut solennia ratificationis Diplomata intra spatium triginta dierum à die Sub∣scriptionis vel citius in Confiniis per Il∣lustrissimos & Excellentissimos legatos Plenipotentiarios Mediatores reciprocè recteque commutentur, legati Plenipoten∣tiarii utriusque imperii sese infallibilitèr obligant, atque praestituros compromit∣tunt. XX. Duret Armistitium hocce, & exten∣datur, (favente Deo) ad viginti quinque Annos continuè sequentes à die, qua ejusdem subscriptio facta fuerit; quo Annorum numero clapso, vel etiam me∣dio tempore priusquam elabatur, liberum esto utrique partium, si ità placuerit, Pacem hanc ad plures adhuc Annos pro∣rogare. Itaque mutuo, & libero consensu quae∣cunque stabilita sunt Pacta inter Majesta∣tem Serenissimi, & Potentissimi Ramano∣rum Imperatoris, & Majestatem Serenis∣simi & Potentissimi Ottommannorum Im∣peratoris & Haeredes eorundem imperia quoque & Regna ipsorum: Terrâ item marique sitas, Regiones, civitates, urbes, subditos, & clientes observentur sanctè, religiosè, ac inviolabiliter, & demande∣tur seriò omnibus utriusque partis Gu∣bernatoribus, Praefectis, Ducibus Exerci∣tuum, atque Militiis, & quibusvis in eo∣rundem clientela, obedientiae & subjecti∣oni existentibus, ut illi quoque praede∣claratis conditionibus, clausulis, pactis, & articulis sese adaequatè conformantes omnibus modis caveant; ne contra Pacem, & amicitiam hanc sub quocunque nomi∣ne, aut praetextu, se invicem offendant, aut damnificent, sed quolibet prorsus ini∣micitiae genere abstinendo bonam colant vicinitatem, certò scientes, quod si cate∣nus admoniti morem non gesserint, se∣verissimis
in se poenis animadvertendum fore. Ipse quoque Crimensis Chanus, & omnes Tartarorum Gentes quovis nomi∣ne vocitatae ad Pacis hujus, & bonae vi∣cinitatis, & reconciliationis Jura ritè ob∣servanda adstricti sint, nec iisdem con∣traveniendo, hostilitates qualescunque ex∣erceant erga quasvis Caesareas Provincias, earumque Subditos aut Clientes: Porro sive ex aliis Exercituum generibus, sive ex Nationibus Tartarorum, si quis con∣tra Sacras Imperatorias hasce Capitula∣tiones, & contra Pacta, & Articulos ea∣rum quidpiam ausus fuerit, is poenis rigorosissimis coerceatur. Incipiat verò modo dicta Pax, Quies, & Securitas subditorum utriusque Imperii à supradata die Subscriptionis, & cessent exinde, atque sustollantur omnes utrinque inimicitiae, & Subditi utriusque partis se∣curitate, & tranquillitate fruantur; Eo∣que fine, & quò magis per summam cu∣ram, ac sedulitatem hostilitates inhiberi possint, transmittantur quàm celerrimè Mandata, & Edicta publicandae Pacis ad omnes confiniorum Praefectos, cumque spatium aliquod temporis requiratur, in∣tra quod officiales in remotioribus prae∣sertim Confiniis istam conclusae Pacis no∣titiam obtinere valeant, statuuntur vi∣ginti dies pro termino, post quem si quis hostile quidpiam alterutra ex parte ad∣mittere praesumpserit, poenis superius de∣claratis irremissibiliter subjaceat. Ut demum Pacis Conditiones Viginti hisce articulis conclusae utrinque accepta∣tae, & debito summóque cum respectu in∣violatae observentur: Si quidem Domini Plenipotentiarii Ottomannici vi concessae iisdem facultatis Imperatoriae instrumen∣tum Turcico sermone exaratum, & sub∣scriptum, legitimum, & validum nobis exhibuerint: Nos quoque vi Mandati, & Plenipotentia nostra, propriis mani∣bus, & propriis Sigillis Subscriptas, & Signatas hasce Pactorum literas in Latino Idiomate tanquam legitimum, & validum vicissim Instrumentum extradidimus.
THE INSTRUMENT OF THE Treaty of Peace, BETWIXT THE GERMAN and OTTOMAN Empires, Subscrib'd, January 26. 1699. FOR the perpetual Memory of the Thing, Be it known to all whom it may Concern, That after a cruel and pernicious War had for 17 years been carried on with the Effusion of much Blood and Desolation of many Provinces, between the most Serene and most Potent Prince and Lord Leopold, Elect of the Romans, and Emperor of Germany, always August, King of Hun∣garia, Bohemia, Dalmatia, Croatia, Scla∣vonia, Arch-Duke of Austria, Duke of Burgundy, Brabant, Styria, Carinthia, Car∣niola, Marquis of Moravia, Duke of Lux∣emburgh, of the Upper and Lower Silesia, of Wirtemberg and Tecka, Prince of Swe∣via, Count of Habsburgh, of Tyrol, Ky∣burgh and Goritia, Marquis of the Sacred Roman Empire, of Burgovia, of the Upper and Lower Lusatia, Lord of the Marqui∣sate of Sclavinia, of the Port of Naon, and the Salt Mines, on one part: And between the most Serene and most Potent Prince and Lord, Sultan Mustapha Han, Emperor of the Ottomans, and of Asia and Greece, and his Glorious Predecessors, on the other Part. These two most Po∣tent Emperors, out of a just Sense of Compassion towards their afflicted Sub∣jects, at length, resolving to put an End to these Mischiefs every Day encreasing with Destruction to Mankind, the Divine Goodness brought it to pass, that by the Endeavours and Mediation of the most Serene and most Potent Prince and Lord, William III. King of Great Britain, France, and Ireland, and the High and Mighty Lords, the States General of the United Belgic Provinces, that Solemn Treaties of Peace were set on foot at Carlowitz in Sirmium upon the Confines of both Em∣pires, and there brought to a Conclusion; There Meeting at the said place, on the part of his Sacred Caesarean and Impe∣rial Majesty of the Romans, as his Ple∣nipotentiaries, the most Illustrious and most Excellent Lords, Wolfang, Count d'Ottingen, of the Sacred Roman Empire, Chamberlain of his Sacred Caesarean Ma∣jesty, and Privy-Counsellor and President of the Imperial Aulic Council; and the Lord Leopold Schlik, Count in Passaun and Weiskirchen, of the Sacred Roman Empire, Chamberlain of his said Caesa∣rean Majesty, Captain General of the Guards, and Colonel of the Regiment of Desvetorii: Both these, at these Treaties of Peace, with the Ottoman Port, De∣puted Ambassadors Extraordinary and Plenipotentiaries; But on the part of his Imperial Ottomannick Majesty, the most Illustrious and most Excellent Lords, Mehemet Effendi, Supreme Chancellor of the Ottoman Empire, and the Lord Alex∣ander Mauro Cordato, of the Noble Fa∣mily of Scarlati, Privy Counsellor and Secretary of the said Empire; By the Intervention and Care of the most Illu∣strious and most Excellent Lords, the Lord William Paget, Baron Beaudesert, and the Lord Jacob Colyer, Ambassadors from the most Serene King of Great Britain, and the High and Mighty States General, to the Ottoman Port, and
both of 'em Ambassadors Extraordinary for the Establishment of this Peace, and both of 'em perform'd the Office of Mediator with Integrity, Industry and Prudence, after having Invok'd the Name of GOD, and Exchanged the Powers, receiv'd the Twenty following Articles of Peace, which were Agreed upon to the Glory of GOD, and the Safety of both Empires. I. THE Region of Transylvania, as it is at present in the Possession, and in the Power of his Caesarean Majesty, so it shall remain under his Dominion, Bounded by the Confines of Podolia, and with the Mountains on the side of Walachia, which were its Antient Limits before the present War, between Transylvania on one part, and Moldavia and Walachia on the other; and on the side of Walachia, it is to extend to the River Merisch, to be Circumscrib'd by the Mountains, that were its Antient Boundaries, and so the Antient Limits are to be observ'd by both Empires, without extending or diminishing them on either side. II. The Province subject to the Fortress of Temeswaer, with all its Districts and Ri∣vers, shall remain in the Possession and un∣der the Power of the Sublime Ottoman Empire; and it shall remain Bounded by Transylvania on one side, and by Walachia on the other, to the River Merisch, the Antient Boundaries of Transylvania, men∣tion'd in the former Article: Then from the River Merisch to the nearer Banks of the Tibisch; and from the Tibisch to the Danube, to be Limited by the hither Banks of the Tibisch; and as for Caran∣sebes, Lugos, Lippa, Csanad, Kiscanisia, Betche, Betskerecke, and Sablia, which are comprehended within these prescrib'd Li∣mits between the Merisch and the Tibisch, and were before the present War belonging to the Territories of Temeswaer, both these and any other place of the like Nature, shall be slighted by the Imperialists, so that by Virtue of this present Treaty they may not be Rebuilt, and this foresaid Region of Te∣meswaer is to be left Free and Entire; so that for the time to come, neither in these Places, nor on the Banks of Merisch or Ti∣bisch, shall it be lawful to Build any Places that shall carry the Appearance of Fortifica∣tions. The use of the Rivers Tibisch and Me∣risch between the Province of Temeswaer, and those subject to the Imperialists, shall be left Free and Common to those Subjects of both Empires, as well in relation to the Watering of their Cattle, as to the Fish∣ing, and any other Conveniencies to both Subjects. Ships of any Burden, coming from Parts subject to the Imperialists, whether it be from the Merisch into the Tibisch, and from the Tibisch into the Danube, are by no means to be hindred or stop'd, whether they are going up or down the Streams; so that the Naviation of German Ships, or other Subjects of the Empire, are neither going nor coming to be Incommoded, but their Passage, both going and coming, is to be Free in both the said Rivers; And be∣cause the common Convenience of mutual Friendship and Kindness requires, that the Ottoman Subjects should likewise partake of the Benefits of these Rivers, therefore they may freely make use of Fishermens Ships, or other Boats. But Mills built on Bottoms of Ships can be only planted there, where they do not Obstruct the Navigation of the Imperialists, and that to be done by Communicating with, and Consent of the Governours on both sides; and the Intent of this is, That the Navi∣gation of the Merisch be not rendred worse to the Imperialists, whether it be by lessen∣ing the Stream for the sake of Mills, or any other pretence whatsoever. The Islands in both the said Rivers, that are in the possession of the Imperialists, are to remain so; and that the Subjects on both sides may live Quietly and Peaceably, is to be provided by severe Edicts, forbidding all sort of Insolencies and Contraventions to the present Articles. III. Considering the Region commonly call'd Batska, betwixt the Tibisch and the Da∣nube, is in the sole Possession, and under the Power of his Imperial Majesty, it is agreed, it shall for the future continue so, and Titul is not to be more Fortify'd than it is at present. IV. A right Line to be drawn from the Ex∣treme Bank of the Tibisch opposite to that of Titul, and to that Angle of Land made by the Conjunction of the Tibisch and Da∣nube to the Bank on the other side the Da∣nube, and thence to be stretch'd streight to Moravitz on the hither Bank of the River Bossut, and from thence to the place where the Grand Stream of the River Bossut falls into the Save, and Moravitz is to remain
without any Fortification, and only open Vil∣lages to be built on both sides the River, and the Empires shall remain separated by the foresaid Line, to be mark'd out either by Ditches, Stones, or Pales, or any other way, after the following manner, viz. That part of the Country within the foresaid Limits to∣wards Belgrade, shall remain Subject to the Ottoman Emperor; but the Country on the other side the said Line shall continue under the Dominion and in the Possession of the most Potent Roman Emperor, and accoridng to the foresaid Boundaries, the adjacent Rivers are to remain in the Possession of each Party. V. Reckoning from the River Bossut flowing into the Save, and likewise the Entrance of the River Unna into the same River, that part of the Save adjoyning to the Imperial Country, is to remain to his Imperial Ma∣jesty, and the other part to the Turkish Em∣peror. The River Save, flowing betwixt both Dominions, and the Islands situated in it, shall be common to the Subjects of both Em∣pires, as well for the Use of Navigation up and down the River, as any other sort of Conveniencies, who are to enjoy a peaceable and undisturb'd Commerce: That Country on the side the River Unna towards Bosnia, belonging to the Turkish Empire, shall be terminated by the Banks of that River No∣vi, Dubizza, Jessenovitza, Doboy, and Brod, on the side of Bosnia, are to be E∣vacuated, and ev'ry other such like place in this Tract of Land, and the Imperial Garri∣sons to be all withdrawn, and the Country to be left Free: But Castanovitz, and the Islands on this side Novi, towards the Save, and the further Banks, shall be left distinct from these Limits, considering it is Agreed, they should remain in the Possession of the Roman Emperor. As to the Places beyond the Unna, of great distance from the Save, which are Garrison'd and Possess'd some of 'em by one Party to this Treaty, and some by the other, with the Lands that were Appendages, and belonging to the said Places before the pre∣sent War, it is Agreed, They should remain to the Possessor, with this Condition, That Commissaries on both sides suddenly to be appointed shall separate each District or Ter∣ritory by particular Lines to be distinguish'd by Ditches, Stones, Posts, or any other evi∣dent Marks to avoid Confusion; particularly the Confines of Croatia are thus to be distin∣guish'd, and the Bounds of all other Places now in the Possession and under the Power of each Party to this Treaty. And on both sides, it is Agreed, That if any one dare presume to alter, change, re∣move, pull up, destroy, or violate any thing that is thus set for distinguishing Land-Marks, he if found out, or convicted by any manner of Enquiry, shall for an Example to others, be most severely punished. It shall likewise be an Instruction to the Commissaries to be as soon as possible Deputed on each side by the Sovereign Authority, that as the end of their Deputation is the fixing the Limits and Boundaries of each Empire, so their principal Intention shall be the Se∣curity and Quiet of the Subjects of both Em∣pires, and this to be so manag'd, that with∣out Personal Heats on either side, or with∣out any particular Regards, they plainly di∣stinguish the Limits of each Empire. The Fortifications of Brod on the other side the Save, (lately made by the Imperia∣lists) at the time the Place is Evacuated by the Garrison, it is Agreed, should be Slighted, yet considering that Place is very convenient for a Staple for Merchants, it shall be law∣ful to Enclose that Place with convenient Walls, but still not such as shall arise to the Nature of a Fortification. VI. The Limits thus fix'd by this Treaty, and afterwards, as Occasions require, to be more distinctly settled by the personal view of Com∣missaries on both sides, shall for times to come be with so much Exactness and Religion ob∣serv'd, that they shall not be extended, al∣ter'd, transferr'd, or chang'd upon what pre∣tence soever. Nor shall any of these Parties, the Limits thus set forth and establish'd, pretend to Exercise any sort of Jurisdiction beyond the Lines and Bounds thus describ'd, whether it be upon pretence of Collecting of Tribute or Contributions for times past, or for the pre∣sent, or for times to come, or upon pretence that these Subjects deliver'd themselves over to the other side, or upon any other Colour or Account whatsoever, be permitted, allow'd, or conniv'd at to make Collections out of each others Districts, or in the least to molest each other, that all Occasion of Quarrel and Dispute may be for ever remov'd. VII. It shall be lawful for each Party, for the Security of their Confines on the Lands thus peaceably set out and possessed by this present Treaty, in the best manner they can, to re∣pair and strengthen all Castles, Fortifications, and other Places now in being, except it be those against which there are particular Pro∣visions made: But in the Extreme Confines of both Empires, it is Agreed, That open
Villages may be without any Lett or Hin∣drance, rais'd, yet so that there be not any Fortifications erected. VIII. All sudden or private Insults, all hostile Incursions or Devastations, or Executions from the Subjects of one Empire upon the other, are forbid upon the severest Penal∣ties; The Contraveners or Transgressors of this Article, wheresoever they are found, shall immediately be Imprison'd, and by the Justice of the Place where they are taken, shall be punish'd without Pardon or Reprieve; Diligent Search shall be made after what they have thus Rob'd or Unjustly Acquir'd; and when it is found, it shall be wholly re∣stor'd to its proper Owner. The Captains, Commanders, and Governors, in both the Empires, shall Administer equal Justice, un∣der the Penalty not only of their Office, but of their Life and Honour. IX. It shall not be Lawful for either of the Emperors to Receive or Comfort in his Do∣minions, the Rebels or Malecontents of the Others; But such Fugitives as these, as like∣wise all Robbers, Thieves, altho' they are the Subjects of the Other Empire, yet shall they be punish'd in the Country they are found in: If they lie Conceal'd, then all Endea∣vours may be us'd to discover 'em to the Go∣vernours of those Places, and they upon such Discovery are oblig'd to punish 'em; If these Governours be Remiss in Punishing of these wicked Men, then shall they incur the utmost Displeasure of their Emperor, and shall be put out of their Employment, or lose their own Lives. And that a Securer Restraint may be made to the Extravagancies of these Wretches, it is provided, That neither of the Parties shall Entertain or Nourish the Hay∣dones, whom they call Freebooters, and those Partymen nam'd from Pribecke, or any other sort of Men, who not being in the Pay of either Empire, live upon Robbery and Rapine, and both these and those that nourish and assist 'em, shall be punish'd ac∣cording to their Demerits; And so intole∣rable are such Wretches, that tho' they pro∣mise Amendment of their Customary Life, yet is not Credit in this case to be Indulg'd to 'em, but they are to be remov'd from the Confines to some more remote Parts of the Empires. X. In the time of the War, several of the Hungarians and Transilvanians withdrew themselves from the Subjection of his Cae∣sarean Majesty into the Confines of the Sub∣lime Port, and by the present Truce it is Agreed, these shall be Indemnify'd in the manner following, viz. They shall have con∣venient Habitations allotted them in the Ot∣toman Empire; But least the Peace and Tranquillity of the Bordering Subjects should be endanger'd to be disturb'd, the Places ap∣pointed for their Abode shall be remote from the Boundaries of the Empires: The Wives likewise of these shall be permitted to follow 'em, and to Cohabit with 'em in the Places thus assign'd. But considering these Men are always hereafter to be taken as Subjects of the Ottoman Empire, it shall never here∣after be Lawful for 'em to Forsake or Re∣nounce to that Subjection; And in case they pretend to Recede from it, and to return into their Native Country, they shall be deem'd Rebels or Malecontents, nor shall they receive Entertainment or Succour from the Imperi∣alists, but being taken they shall be deliver'd to the Ottoman Governours on the Borders, that by this means the present Peace may on both sides be better secur'd. XI. In Order to remove all Differences, Contro∣versies, or Discords, which might arise concern∣ing the Interpretation of any of these Articles or any other matter during this Truce, it is Agreed, That where there shall be occasion for a ready and effectual Remedy, an equal number of Commissaries shall on both sides be immediately chose on the Confines: These shall be Sober, Prudent, Experienc'd, and Peaceable Men, who without Troops meeting with an unarm'd Retinue of equal number on both sides, shall hear, consider, decide, and amicably Agree all such Controversies as can arise, and shall propound and appoint such Order and Methods, by which either Party shall without delay or fraud, reduce or com∣pel their Servants and Subjects to a sincere Observance of this Peace; But if Matters of such great Moment should arise, that such Commissaries are not able to Agree or Deter∣mine 'em, then shall Affairs be refer'd to the two most Potent Emperors themselves, that they themselves may find out and apply so proper Means or Expedients for the setling such Differences, that they may in as short a time as possible be finally determin'd, nor shall such Resolutions be neglected or long Protracted. Whereas in the Sacred Articles of former Treaties between the two Empires, Duels, and all sort of Challenges in order to 'em, have been forbid; it is now likewise Agreed, that in like manner for the time to come they shall remain unlawful, and if any dare
presume to enter into single Combates, they shall be proceeded against with the utmost rigour. XII. The Captives, that during this present War have on each side been carry'd away, and are at present remaining in the publick Prisons, considering from this happy Peace, they may reasonably expect Release, nor can they be retain'd in this Misery without In∣dignity to the Imperial Majesty, and Offence of laudable Custom, shall be restor'd by way of Exchange upon the usual or more easie Con∣ditions; and in case there are more on one side than on the other, or some of greater Quality on one side than on the other; yet the Solemn Demands of the Ambassador on each side shall so far prevail upon the Clemency of each Emperor, that these Supernumeraries shall with the rest find a Release: But as for the Prisoners that are in private Hands, or amongst the Tartars, they shall be Redeem'd upon Equitable and as moderate Terms as possible: But if such fair Agreement cannot be made with the Patrons of these Slaves, the particular Judges of the Places where they live shall settle this Matter of what is to be pay'd for their Redemption; but if those ways should fail, then the Captives them∣selves making it appear by Testimonies or Oaths, what their Masters pay'd for 'em, up∣on the Repayment of that Money shall be Re∣leas'd; Nor shall it be permitted to their Masters to oppose themselves to this Release upon the pretence of a greater Price; and considering that on the part of the Ottoman Empire there may be no particular Society of Men employ'd to look after this Redemption of Captives; yet it is Agreed, That the Caesa∣rean Magistrates stand in Honour oblig'd to see the Turkish Slaves Releas'd upon the Pay∣ment of what they cost their Masters, so that this work may be carry'd on with equal Since∣rity on both sides: And that such Captives may at length gain their Liberty, the Am∣bassadors of each Empire shall in the mean time use all good Offices, that they may in the mean time be treated with Mildness and Hu∣manity. XIII. As concerning the Religious Orders, or Exercise of the Christian Religion, according to the Rites of the Roman Catholick Church, it is Agreed, by the most Serene and most Potent Ottoman Emperor, That whatsoever Indulgences have been made by the precedent most Glorious Ottoman Emperors in their Do∣minions, whether it were by Antecedent Sacred Capitulations, by Imperial Signets, by Edicts or Special Mandates, that all these shall stand good and confirm'd; so that the fore∣said Religious may repair and rebuild their Churches, may Exercise their usual and ac∣custom'd Functions; so that it shall not be lawful from any one, contrary to these Sacred Capitulations and Divine Laws, to impose upon 'em any sort of trouble or pecuniary Ex∣action, let these Religious be of what Order or Condition soever, they shall enjoy the usual Protection and Goodness of the Impe∣rial Ottoman Empire. Besides, it shall be allow'd to the Ambas∣sador of the most Serene and most Potent Roman Emperor to the Fulgid Port, to en∣ter into Treaty there according to his Instru∣ctions about the Religion and Places of Chri∣stian Pilgrimage or Visitation in the Holy City of Jerusalem, and he shall there lay be∣fore the Imperial Throne his Demands about these Matters. XIV. The Commerce according to the former Sa∣cred Capitulations, shall be free to the Sub∣jects on both sides, through all the Kingdoms and Dominions of both Empires, but this in∣tercourse of mutual. Trade may be perform'd without Fraud, and with just Profit, at the times of the Solemn Embassies on both sides, there shall be appointed Commissioners well vers'd in Mercantile Affairs, who shall De∣bate this Matter; and the same Privileges the High Empire allows to other Nations in Friendship with it, shall with the same Secu∣rity and Advantages to the Subjects of his Caesarean Majesty of what Nation soever they may be. XV. Whatsoever Conditions are express'd in the Antient Sacred Capitulations, shall stand good and be religiously Observ'd, provided they do not contradict the Articles of this present Treaty, or are no ways prejudicial or obstru∣ctive to that free Exercise of Power, which each Empire is intended to have in its own Dominions; and in case any former Articles come under this Discription, then they are declar'd by these Presents null and void. XVI. And that this present Truce may the bet∣ter grow and be confirm'd into a mutual Friendship and Confidence betwixt the two most potent Emperors, Extraordinary Ambas∣sadors shall be sent on both sides, who are to be Receiv'd, Treated, and Attended from their Entrance into the Confines, and during their stay, and to the time of their Return
till they are again Exchang'd with the usual Ceremonies, and for a more manifest Decla∣ration of the Friendship between the two Em∣perors, these Ambassadors shall bring and make voluntary Presents, yet such as shall correspond to, and be agreeable to the High Dignity of each Emperor. And the said Ambassadors, by Concert in June in the en∣suing Summer, at the same time beginning their Journey, shall be Exchang'd in the Confines of Sirmium, after the manner that has been us'd upon such Occasions. And it shall be permitted to each of the Ambassadors at the Imperial Courts, to make what Requests they shall think convenient. XVII. The Rule for Receiving, Entertaining, or Treating the Ministers by the Courtiers of each Empire, shall be taken from the practice of former times, to be executed with all imaginable Candor and Decency, according to that distinct Prerogative which the Characters of those that are sent shall Demand. The Caesarean Ambassadors, Envoys, or Resi∣dents, and their Attendants, shall without the hindrance of any one, enjoy a full liberty of using what sort of Garments they please. Besides, the Caesarean Minister, whether he be Vested with the Character of Ambassador, Envoy, Resident, or Agent, shall at the Ful∣gid Port enjoy the same Privileges and Im∣munities, which the Ambassadors or Agents of any other Princes there enjoy, and to make a Distinction of the Prerogative of the Caesarean Dignity, with the usual Marks of Preference: They shall have liberty of Hi∣ring their own Interpreters, and their Messen∣gers that come to the Fulgid Port, or return from it to Vienna, shall have free Passage going and coming, with all convenient Fa∣vour and Assistance in their Journey. XVIII. This Peace tho' it now stands concluded upon the present Conditions, yet it shall then only be esteem'd to have and to receive its full force of Obligation and Effect, when all and singular Conditions, stipulated and ac∣cepted on both sides, as well concerning the Distinctions of the Borders, as the Evacua∣tions and Demolishments shall be fully exe∣cuted in this manner, after the Limits are settled, then shall the Evacuations and De∣molishments of Places follow, and that all this may as soon as possible be put in practice, Commissaries to settle these Distinctions, shall on both sides be appointed, who at the Equi∣noctial, S.N. 22. S.V. 12 of March, A.D. 1699. shall with a moderate and peaceable Attendance, meet at Places to be determin'd by the Governors of the Confines, and these Commissaries shall within two months or less, if possible, by manifest marks describ'd in the former Articles separate and set apart these Confines, and shall with all exactness and expedition, execute all other things that shall be Agreed by the Plenipo∣tentiaries of both Empires. XIX. The Plenipotentiaries of both Empires do mutually Oblige themselves, and Promise, that these Conditions and Articles thus re∣duc'd into Form, shall be mutually Ratify'd by the Majesty of each of the Emperors, and that within 30 days or sooner from the time of Subscription, the Ratifications shall in Solemn manner be mutually Exchang'd in the Confines by the most Illustrious and most Ex∣cellent Lords the Plenipotentiary Mediators. XX. This Truce shall continue, and God willing, extend to full 25 years, to be reckon'd from the day of the Subscription, after the Expi∣ration of which Term; or in the middle of it, it shall be in the Power of either of the Parties; that so shall think fit, to prolong it to a greater number of Years. Therefore what things soever are here esta∣blish'd by the mutual and free Consent of the Majesty of the most Serene and most Potent Emperor of the Romans on the one part, and the Majesty of the most Serene and most Potent Ottoman Emperor on the other, and their Heirs, shall be Religiously and Inviolably observ'd thro' all their Empires and Kingdoms, by Land and Sea, through all their Cities and Towns, and by all their Subjects and Dependants; and it is likewise Agreed, that it shall on both sides be strictly enjoyn'd to all Governours, Commanders, Captains, Generals, to all the Soldiery, to all under their Protection, to all in Subjection and Obedience under them, that they take diligent Care to Conform themselves to all the above-mention'd Conditions, Clauses, Compacts and Articles, that under what pre∣tence or colour soever, contrary to the Peace and Friendship thus establish'd, the Subjects on either side do not offend or injure one ano∣ther; but abstaining from all sort of Enmity, they are commanded to become good Neigh∣bours to each other, under the severest Pe∣nalties, if after they are thus admonish'd, they do not yield a ready Obedience. The Tartar Cham likewise, and all the Nations of the Tartars, by whatsoever Names they are call'd, stand engag'd to the Obser∣vance of this Peace, Good Neighbourhood, and Reconciliation; nor shall it be permitted 'em in prejudice of these Agreements to commit any Hostilities in the Provinces; or upon
any of the Subjects, or upon any under the Protection of his Caesarean Majesty. More∣over, if any one shall presume to Act contrary to these Sacred Imperial Capitulations, Agree∣ments or Articles, whether he belongs to the Tartar Nations, or to any other Forces by whatsoever Name call'd, he shall be most ri∣gorously punish'd. This Peace, Cessation, and Security of the Subjects on both sides, shall commence from the Date of this Subscription, and thence all Enmities on both sides shall cease and be ex∣tinguish'd, and the Subjects on both sides shall enjoy full Security and Tranquillity, and for that end, and in order all Hostili∣ties may be carefully prevented, Mandates and Edicts for publishing the Peace shall as soon as possible be sent to all Governours of the Confines; but considering some time will be requisite, that the Officers in the remoter Confines may have notice of this Peace, 20 days are for this purpose appointed, after which, if any one on either side presume to commit any sort of Hostility, he shall with∣out Mercy, suffer the Punishments before de∣clar'd. In the last place, that these Conditions of Peace, contain'd in 20 Articles, and accepted of on both sides, may with great and due respect be inviolably observ'd; The Lords the Ottoman Plenipotentiaries, by Virtue of an Imperial Faculty granted to 'em for that pur∣pose, have deliver'd to us an Authentick and  Instrument, writ and subscrib'd in the Turkish Language, are likewise by Virtue of a Special Order, and by our Ple∣nipotentiary Power have on our part deli∣ver'd these Writings of the Articles Sign'd and Subscrib'd by our proper Hands and Seals in the Latin Tongue, as a True and Authen∣tick Instrument. This Treaty between the Emperor, be∣ing thus finished and agreed, the next thing was to appoint Commissaries to re∣gulate the Limits between Croatia, and Bosnia, as was concluded by the Treaty of Peace at Carlovitz, to appear upon the said Limits on the 14/24th of March follow∣ing, in order to which Affair his Imperial Majesty appointed Count Marsilii for his Commissary, giving him Orders to de∣part from Vienna in a Weeks time. But the Ratifications relating to the Articles of Peace concluded on both sides were sooner dispatched, for the Grand Seignior's Rati∣fication of the Treaty arrived at Belgrade, the 9th of March N.S. 1699. of which Advice was given the same day to the Secretary of the Imperial Embassy, who waited at Peter-Waradin with that of the Emperors, that the Exchange might be made on the same Day, the which was accordingly done.

A COPY OF THE Turkish Treaty WITH THE MUSCOVITE, It is God the most Powerful, the most Just, who brings all Things to pass. In the Name of God the Merciful, always Compassionate. THE Reason of the making this Writing Refulgent in Truth, and the necessity of the Description of this Instrument stamp'd with Rea∣lity, is this; The War betwixt the Sublime Empire of Mustapha, by the Concessions of the Plenitude of the Eternal Confirmations of the Incorruptible Lord Creator, and the Immortal Maker of most Freewill, the Lord God, whose Glory be extoll'd beyond Simili∣tude or Equality, and by the Grace of the most Honour'd Mecca, and the Servant of the most Illustrious Medina, Defender and Rector of the Holy Jerusalem, and other Blessed Places, Sultan of the two Earths, and King of the two Seas, Lord of Potent Egypt, and the Abyssine Provinces, and Arabia the Happy, and the Land of Adenum and Cae∣sarean Africk, and Tripoly and Tunis, and the Island of Cyprus and Rhodes, and Crete, and other Islands of the White Sea, and Emperor of Babylon, and Bosnia, and Laxa, and Revanum, and Carsia, and Er∣zirum, and Sehresul, and Mussul, and Di∣arbekir, and Rica, and Damascus, and A∣leppo, and Sultan of the Persic and Arabic Irachian Region, and King of Ghiurdistania and Turchistania, and Daghistania, and Trapezuntum, and Emperor of the Pro∣vinces of Rum, and Zulchadria, and Ma∣ras, Emperor of the Regions of Tartary, of Circassia, and the Abastans, and the Crimea and Desti-Capzac, Emperor of the East and West, and Anatolia and Rumelia, Possessor of the Royal-Seat of Constantinople, and Protected Prussia, and Defended Adriano∣ple, and besides of so many the most large Provinces, and of so many Climates and Ci∣ties, and most Celebrated Governour, Sultan of Sultans, King of Kings, most Serene, most Potent, most August Lord our Emperor, the Refuge of Musulmen, Sultan Son of Sultans, Son of Sultan King Mehmet, (whose Empire God perpetuate, and establish his Government to the Day of Judgment;) And the most glorious amongst the principal Christians, Di∣rector of the great Affairs of the Christian Commonwealths, Adorn'd with the Robes of Greatness and Majesty, Conspicuous with the Power of Greatness and Glory, the Czar of the Muscovite Regions, and Lord of all the Ruthenic Provinces and Possessor of the Lands and Cities Subject to them, the Sub∣lime Czar of Musovy, Peter Alexovic, (whose End let God crown with Salvation and Righteousness,) considering this War for some Years has been the Occasion of Calamity to the Subjects on both sides, with an Intent, that it might be chang'd into Friendship and Kindness, that Affairs might be put into bet∣ter
Order, and the State of the Servants of God might be reduc'd into a better Condition, in the Congress of Sirmium in the Confines of Carlovitz, upon Treaty with the most Illustrious and most Excellent amongst the Christian Grandees, Lord Procopius Begda∣noviz Vosniziri, Plenipotentiary Commissio∣nated by the Czar, and Ambassador Extra∣ordinary, and Privy-Counsellor, and Lieute∣nant of Bolchia, Design'd and Deputed by the said Czar with full Powers to Treat and Conclude a Peace, and the most Illustrious and most Excellent amongst the Christian Grandees, William Lord Pagett, Baron of Beaudesert, &c. and Lord Jacob Colyer, performing the part of Mediators, with great good Offices and Diligence, Deputed so to do by the most Glorious amongst the most Illustri∣ous Christian Princes, and the Resort of the Rulers of the Nations, William III. of Eng∣land, Scotland, and Ireland, King, and the States General, (whose Ends God crown with Salvation and Righteousness,) altho' both Par∣ties show'd a Propensity and Inclination to Peace and Reconciliation; but considering in so short a time it was not easie to remove all Difficulties, and to settle all things Agreea∣ble to Friendship and good Neighbourhood; Therefore, least the Continuance of these good Treaties should be interrupted, but that they should proceed and be brought to an End, with this Intent on both sides, by mutual Consent, the Term of Two Years is Agreed on to begin from the 25th of December, Christmas-day, A. Heg. 1110. within which time this good Treaty may be reduced in∣to Order, and by the Grace of the most High God, a Peace or Truce may be concluded betwixt the Sublime Empire, and the Mus∣covitish Czareate, by which perpetual and ancient Friendship may be Renew'd. There∣fore within the Term thus prefix'd, by una∣nimous Consent, all War, Battles, and Skir∣mishes shall cease, and all Hostilities shall be remov'd and forbid to the Subjects of the Czar of Muscovy, both Muscovites and Cossacks, and all others, there shall be no Excursion, Hostility, Damage, whether pri∣vately or publickly done or committed, upon the Musulman Confines, subject to the Sub∣lime Empire, whether in the Crimea, or any other Places, or upon the Subjects of this Em∣pire: In like manner on the part of the High Empire, no Army of what Condition soever, especially belonging to the Crimean Cham, and all sorts of Tartars, or Hords, shall make any sort of Excursion, nor commit Damage privately or publickly, upon the Ci∣ties and Towns, and Subjects or Dependants upon the Czar: And if contrary to this Compact and Agreement, which is made be∣twixt us, any, either privately or publickly, shall raise any Commotion, or make Prepara∣tion for it, or shall commit Hostility, or make Incursion, or shall be Obstinate, or not Obedient, let 'em be of what side they will, they shall be Apprehended, Imprison'd, and Punish'd without Mercy; Therefore after this method shall this Truce be cultivated and observ'd during the time of it, all Conflicts and Hostilities shall be remov'd and extin∣guish'd, and both Parties with full Inclination shall apply themselves to the Conclusion of a Peace, and the Crimean Cham shall be in∣cluded in this Place, by reason of the Obe∣dience and Subjection he owes to the Sublime Empire: That it may be receiv'd and observ'd on both sides, the Plenipotentiary Ambassa∣dor and Commissary of the highly foremention'd Czar, by Virtue of his Powers and Authority, has deliver'd an Authentick Instrument in due Form, written in the Muscovite Lan∣guage: We likewise by Virtue of our Powers and Deputation, have deliver'd this Authen∣tick Instrument in due Form, Subscrib'd with our Hands and Seal'd with our Seals. God is favourable to Justice.
A COPY OF THE Muscovite Treaty WITH THE TURKS. IN the Name of the Omnipotent Lord God, One in Holy Trinity: By whose Grace the most Serene and Potent Lord Czar, and Great Duke, Peter Alexo∣vic, Emperor of the Whole Great and Little Russia, of Muscovy, Kiovia, Wolodimi∣ria, Novogardia, Czar of Carania, Czar of Astrachan, Czar of Siberia, Lord of Ples∣covia, Great Duke of Smolenscum, Lord of Treria, Ingoria, Permia, Viatka, Bolga∣ria, and of other Dominions; Great Duke of Novogardia, of the Lower Country, of Csernihovia, Resania, Rostovia, Jaroscla∣via, Belovroria, Valoria, Obdoria, Con∣dinia, and Emperor of all the Northern Coun∣try, and Lord of the Land af Iveria, Czar of the Cartalinensians and Grunizensians, and Duke of Karbardia, of the Csercassians and Mountaneers, and many other Domini∣ons and Lands to the East, West and North, from Father and Ancestors, Heir, Successor, Lord and Commander, between his Majesty and the most Mighty Great Lord Sultan Mustapha Han, Son of Sultan Mehmet Han, Lord of Constantinople, of the White Sea, the Black Sea, of Anatolia, Rumia, Ro∣mania, of the most Honour'd Mecca and Medina, and Holy Jerusalem, of Egypt, of the Abyssines, of Babylon and Rica, and Commander of Damascus, Emperor of the Tartarian and Crimean Hords, as also of many other Dominions, Kingdoms and Cities, Islands and Provinces. Whereas the War for many years has been the Cause of the Misery of the Subjects, and Dependants on both Parties, that Friendship and Kindness might be restor'd, and by that means the Civil Affairs might become bet∣ter settled, and all things chang'd into a more flourishing Condition; with this intent a Congress was had in Sirmium on the Con∣fines of Carlovitz, with the most Illustrious and most Excellent the most Select Lord Great Chancellor Reis Mehmet Effendi, and the most Select Lord of the Privy Council, Mauro Cordato, of the Family of Scarlati, Plenipotentiary Commissioners, and Ambassa∣dors Extraordinary of the highly mention'd Sultan Majesty, Deputed with full Powers to Treat of and Settle the Business of a Peace, through the Mediation of his most Serene and most Royal Majesty of Great Bri∣tain, and of the States General of the Ne∣therlands, by their most Excellent Plenipo∣tentiaries, Ambassadors Extraordinary, the Lord William Lord Pagett, Baron de Beau∣desert, &c. and Lord Jacob Colyer, &c. both sides show'd an Inclination to a Peace and Truce, but in so short a time it was not easie to remove all Difficulties, and put all things into an Order agreeable to Friendship and Good Neighbourhood; yet least the Con∣tinuance of these Treaties should be Inter∣rupted, and that they might be perfected and brought to an end, with this Intent, by mu∣tual Consent on both sides, a Truce, betwixt the two great highly mention'd Lords, is Agreed on for Two Years, to Commence from Christmas-day, the 25th day of December, Anno Domini 1698. within which Term, this Treaty may be reduc'd into good Order, and by the Blessing of God, a perpetual Peace
or a Truce for a sufficient Number of years may be Concluded, and Antient Friendship restor'd betwixt his Czarish Muscovite Ma∣jesty, and Turkish Sultan Majesty; There∣fore within this prefix'd time, all War, Bat∣tles, Fights, and Skirmishes, shall Cease, and on both sides all Hostilities shall be re∣mov'd and extinguish'd; nor shall any In∣cursion or Hostility be done, or any Damage committed, either privately or publickly by the Subjects of his Czarish Majesty, whether Muscovites or Cossacks, or others, within the Mussulman or Crimean Confines, or within any other of his Sultan Majesty's Do∣minions, or on any of his Subjects. In like manner on the part of his Sultan Majesty no sort of Troops of what Condition soever shall be brought against his Czarish Majesty, especially the Crimean Cham, and the Tar∣tars of what Nation or Hord soever shall be oblig'd not to make any Incursions, or do any Damage publickly or privately, either in the Cities, Towns, or Territories, Subject to his Czarish Majesty: And if contrary to this Constitution and Agreement made betwixt us, any privately or publickly should raise any Commotion, or make Preparation for it, or make Incursion, or Commit Hostility, such obstinate and disobedient Persons of what side soever they are, shall be Apprehended, Imprison'd, and Inevitably punish'd without Mercy: By this Method for the time ap∣pointed for this Cessation of Arms, all Con∣flicts and Hostilities shall be absolutely taken away and abolish'd, and both Parties shall apply to conclude a Peace, with sincere En∣deavours and full Inclination, and the Cri∣mean Cham, according to his Duty and De∣pendance upon his Imperial Turkish Majesty shall be concluded by this Peace. That all these Things may be accepted of, and observ'd by both Parties, because the highly mention'd Plenipotentiary Ambassadors and Commissaries of his Sultan Majesty, by Virtue of their Powers and Authorities, have deliver'd in due Form an Authentick Instrument written in the Turkish Language, and from that a Copy in Latin, Sign'd with their Hands and Seals; in like manner, I by Virtue of the Authority and full Power granted me, have deliver'd in due Form, an Authentic Instru∣ment Subscrib'd with my own Hand, and Con∣firm'd with my Seal, Written in the Ruthenic and Copy'd in the Latin.
INSTRUMENTUM PACIS INTER Serenissimum, & Potentissimum Regem, ET Rempublicam Poloniarum, ET Excelsum Imperium Ottomannicum, Ad Carlowiz in Sirmio, in Congressu Generali Confoedera∣torum Plenipotentiariorum confectae. In Nomine Sanctissimae & Individuae Trinitatis. AD perpetuam Rei memoriam. Omnibus & singulis, quorum in∣terest notum sit, Quandoqui∣dem inter Regnum Polonicum, & Excelsum Imperium intercedens diutur∣num dissidium, Serenissimo & Potentissimo Magnae Britanniae, Franciae & Hyberniae Rege, Guilielmo III. & Praepotentibus Generalibus Foederati Belgii Statibus, si∣stendi humani Sanguinis, & reducendae reciprocae Quietis desiderio, ad procuran∣dos hujus almae Pacis Tractatus, Media∣tionem suam interponentibus, atque officia omnia, & omnes conditiones Mediationis, diligenti operâ & studio explentibus, Ex∣cellentissimis Dominis ad Fulgidam Portam Legatis Plenipotentiariis, Guilielmo Do∣mino Pagett, Barone de Beaudesert, in Comitatu Staffordiensi, ejusdem Comita∣tus Regis Locumtenente, ex parte Maje∣statis Britannicae: & Domino Jacobo Co∣lyer, ex parte Praepotentium Generalium Foederati Belgii Ordinum, favente Deo, reciprocâ utrinque inclinatione atque pro∣pensione sopiri, & penitùs extingui placue∣rit, atque Carlovizii ad Confinia Sirmii, ubi Congressus Legatorum Plenipotentia∣riorum ex Inclytae Mediationis dispositione institutus fuerat, initis Tractatibus de Pacis Articulis cum Illustrissimo & Excel∣lentissimo Domino Mehmet Effendi, Mag∣no Cancellario Excelsi Imperii, & Illustris∣simo atque Excellentissimo Domino Alex∣andro Mauro Cordato, de Nobili Stirpe Scarlati, ab Intimis Secretis ejusdem Ex∣celsi Imperii, ad tractandam Pacem Lega∣tis Plenipotentiariis, post aliquas Sessiones, tandem annuente Divinâ Clementiâ, Ne∣gotium hoc almae desiderataeque Pacis feli∣citer in mutuas Leges coaluerit, & integer∣rima iterum Amicitia, & Pax inter Sere∣nissimum, & Potentissimum Musulmanno∣rum Imperatorem Sultanum, Filium Sul∣tani Mehmeti, Sultanum Mustapha: & Se∣renissimum ac Potentissimum Regem, Au∣gustum Secundum, Dominum meum Cle∣mentissimum & Rempublicam Poloniarum, super undecim, mutuo consensu compositis
hisce Articulis, perpetuò religiosè inter utrumque Dominium observanda, perfecta & conclusa, restituta & renovata est, qui articuli subinde singulatim describuntur. I. CUM Excelso perpetuitati subnixo Im∣perio, multo abhinc tempore inter∣cedente ope, & favore Dei Altissimi sublatâ hostilitate, conciliationi & bonae vicinitati congruâ cum Sinceritate, antiquâ amicitiâ iterum coalescente, ut hostilitates utrinque amoveantur, & Subditi pristinâ securitate, quiete, ac tranquillitate fruantur, ante ul∣tima duo bella constituti veteres Limites restituantur ac stabiliantur, & Confinia Provinciarum subditarum Poloniae, à Con∣finiis Imperialibus tum Moldaviae, tum a∣liorum Districtuum, subjectorum Excelso Imperio, antiquis Limitibus separentur ac distinguantur, nevè utrinque aut praeten∣sio, aut extensio deinceps fiat, sed Limites antiqui sine mutatione aut perturbatione, tanquam sacri, religiosè observentur atque colantur. II. Quaecunque sive Munimenta, sive Loca vel majora, vel minora intra veteres Mol∣daviae Limites, ante penultimum bellum existentes, sita, atque hucusque detenta sunt à Dominis Polonis, eductis atque ex∣tractis inde Polonicis Militiis, evacuentur, & Moldaviae Provincia maneat ex integro libera, ante postremum bellum, in quo e∣rat pacifico Statu. III. Intra veteres quoque ante prostrema duo bella, versus Poloniam, Limites situm Ca∣menici Fortalitium, eductis inde Musul∣mannicis Militiis, evacuetur, & integrum relinquatur, & Podoliae atque Ukrainae Provinciarum nulla deinceps ab Excelso Imperio fiat praetensio, & Ukrainae Kosa∣corum Hatmani nomine Substitutus, qui modò in Moldavia residet, Hatmanus a∣moveatur. Cumque Limites antiqui Po∣loniae & Moldaviae manifesti sint, si com∣modum fuerit tempus, ab initio futuri Martii inchoetur evacuatio, & quàm citiùs fieri poterit, quamprimùm Polonica Mili∣tia è Moldavia educatur, & Munimenta & Loca illius evacuentur, & Moldavia ma∣neat libera. Simulque ab initio Martii Caminecensis Fortalitii evacuatio inchoe∣tur, atque evacuationis negotium, ubi priùs persici poterit, sine haesitatione, & sine tar∣ditate ac negligentia in executionem de∣ducatur, & Caminecensis Fortalitii evacua∣tio ad summum usque in decimum quin∣tum mensis Maii ad finem perducatur; & quò cum facilitate & celeritate dicti Forta∣litii fiat evacuatio, ad onera imponenda, & transvehenda, quoad fieri potest, curribus & Jumentis transportationem coadjuvent Poloni, & ubique evacuationis negotium cum securitate & salva re peragatur: in quibus evacuationibns Fortalitiorum, & aliorum Locorum, quoquo Pacto munito∣rum è Subditis, quicunque voluntariè exire velint, cum propriis rebus & Suppellectile exeant tutò & securè, & quicunque re∣manere velint, item tutò remaneant, & utrinque nullatenus impediantur. Et cùm evacuatio Fortalitiorum & Locorum à prin∣cipio Martii Mensis utrinque inchoari de∣beat, instantiam de Tormentorum Came∣nieci relictione, scilicet ex propriis atque ibi repertis, Ablegatus Polonus quampri∣mùm ad Fulgidam Portam expediendus, afferat ad Solium Imperatoris. IV. Nemo Subditorum Excelsi Imperii cu∣juscunque conditionis, praesertim verò Tar∣tari, cujuscunque Gentis, sub cujusvis prae∣tensionis, & controversiae praetextu, in Sub∣ditos Regis & Reipub. Poloniarum, & in Limites eorum hostilitates exercere, excur∣siones agere, Captivos rapere, Pecora abi∣gere, aut quidquid damni inferre, nevè eos offendere possit, expressis Regiis Edictis committatur, & demandetur Vesiriis, Beg∣lerbegis, & felicissimo Crimensi Hano, Ca∣relgaio, & Nuradino, & reliquis Soltanis, ac Woiewodae Moldaviae, ut adhibitâ maxi∣mâ sedulitate observent & conservent Con∣finiorum pacificam tranquillitatem, & con∣ciliationem atque quietem, nevè aut in captivationibus, aut Pecorum abactionibus, aut quacunque aliâ ratione damnis & mo∣lestiis afficiant Poloniae Subditos, & seve∣rissimè inquirant in perturbatores & trans∣gressores conditionum Pacis, atque habitâ notitiâ ad exemplum aliorum in illos ani∣madvertant, & rapta adinventa propriis Dominis restituantur, & si qui hac de re negligenter ac oscitanter agant, sive amissi∣one officiorum, sive privatione vitae, prout ex divinis Legibus convenerit, justè puni∣antur. Pariter Poloni has conditiones Pacis omnino, & sedulò observent atque colant, & nemo in oppositum quidquid audeat. V. Cùm Regnum Poloniae ab antiquo sit li∣berrimum, ab Excelso Imperio aut sub∣jectis eidem Gentibus, qualiscunque prae∣tensionis, aut expostulationis praetextu, nullâ penitùs hostilitate perturbetur, &
conclusae istius almae Pacis Pactorum vi, ad tales praetensiones nequaquam adstrin∣gantur. VI. Tempore hujusce belli Budziacenses, & alii Tartari è propriis Locis exeuntes, atque in Terras Moldavorum ingressi, hostilitates ac offensiones hac occasione in Moldavos & Moldaviam exercent: quod cùm sit contrarium sacris Capitulationibus ante hac concessis Regibus Poloniae, ac proinde ces∣sare ac sustolli debeat, à quibusque Locis & possessionibus, & praediis, & hyemali∣bus in Moldavia aut occupatis, aut de no∣vo extructis Tartari amoveantur, & nati∣vis propriis Locis habitent, atque pacificè vivant, & imposterum nullas offensiones faciant. VII. Religiosi Christiani Romano-Catholici juxta concessa ab Excelso Imperio edicta, ubicunque Ecclesias suas habent, consuetas suas functiones sine impedimento exerce∣ant, & pacificè vivant: & ulteriùs sibi com∣missas Instantias de Regione extraordinarias ad Fulgidam Portam Magnus Legatus ad Imperatorium Solium exponat. VIII. Cum Res Mercatoria è fructibus Pacis existat, atque Provincias in meliorem con∣ditionem reducat, utriusque Dominii Mer∣catores imposterum non per occulta loca meantes, sed per loca transitui opportuna ultrò citróque euntes & redeuntes, post∣quam solverint juxta consuetum ab anti∣quo Telonium rerum portatarum & expor∣tatarum, novis exactionibus, & expostu∣lationibus nequaquam molestentur, nevè ex numerata pecunia Telonium exigatur: & quicunque nativi Subditi Poloniarum, & Lithuaniae, & aliarum subjectarum iisdem Nationum ad Mercimoniam agendam ve∣nientes, & nullum damnum inferentes, praedictâ ratione mercaturam & coemptio∣nem, & venditionem, sicuti in anteceden∣tibus sacris Capitulationibus etiam decla∣ratur, exactione tributi dicti Haracz, & aliis inordinatis exactionibus ne molesten∣tur. Verùm enimverò, si qui relictis suis Regionibus in Imperii regnis sedem figant, & si qui alii Exteriores sese Polonis immis∣ceant, tales ne possint esse detrimento Rei∣publicae, Mercatores Polonorum redeun∣tes ex armis, & equis, & jumentis, & captivis, qui liberationis suae instrumentum legitimum habentes in Patriam redire vo∣luerint, nihil exigatur, & ne quisquam im∣pedimento sit taliter abeuntibus captivis. Verùm sub isto praetextu sine facultate ne∣mini liceat vetita abducere. Praeterea opi∣bus & rebus Mercatorum utriusque Domi∣nii, quibus in aliis Regionibus mori con∣tingat, publici Confiscatores & Partitores ne ab utralibet parte sese immisceant, sed inter Mercatores, cui sides adhibetur, tra∣dantur, ut juxta catalogum depositionis haeredibus tradat; si quis autem casus ac∣ciderit inter Mercatores, inter ipsos Prae∣positi decisione definiatur, ipse verò, quibus debet, rationem reddat. Ad debitum sive Scripto, sive Instrumento Judiciario non affirmatum solvendum contra Divinas Leges nemo compellatur, nevè Testimoniis solis conductitiis lites debitorum & sponsionum dicantur, aut audiantur, Instrumentis sci∣licet legitimis & Scriptis ante extraditis, sacris Mandatis perlectis atque considera∣tis, justè ac debitè causae decidantur, at∣que in similibus causis contexta & statuta in sacris Capitulationibus, ut aliis confoe∣deratis Nationibus concessa, in Polonos etiam Mercatores extendantur, & ulteriùs speciatim Polonis antehac concessorum, & in manibus eorundem servatorum sacrorum Edictorum sensus quoque colatur & obser∣vetur. IX. Captivi tempore belli abacti, pretiis il∣lorum juxta Leges comprobatis aut datis Juramentis in manifestum productis atque solutis juxta antecedentium Capitulatio∣num hac de re declarationem eliberentur. Si verò tales Captivi multo tempore servi∣erint, ex discretione pretia emptionum cum imminui debeant, si honesto & mediocri pretio cum Domino Captivi conveniri non poterit, Judices Locorum legitimè proce∣dentes, tales differentias componant. Si aliquâ occasione post conclusionem Pacis ex Regionibus Polonicis Captivi rapiantur; sine pretio dimittantur: & in Regnis Ex∣celsi Imperii, & inter Tartaros etiam ad eliberandos Polonos captivos circumeuntes Homines, quandocunque res suas pacificè agerent, praetextu operae eliberationi Cap∣tivorum navatae, aut aliâ ratione neuti∣quam offendantur, quinimò offendentes & detrimentum inferentes puniantur, Captivi in publicis Carceribus detenti permutati∣one utrinque in libertatem asserantur. Mag∣nus verò Poloniarum Legatus de Captivis suas Instantias ad Solium Imperiale asse re poterit. X. Quandocunque Serenissimus Rex Poloniae in stabilita cum Excelso Imperio Pace fir∣miter
permanebit, sicuti in antecedentibus Capitulationibus declaratur, Moldaviae Woiewodam eâ ratione, quâ ab antiquo cum Regibus Poloniarum sincerè sese prae∣stitit, rursus consuetâ ratione sincerè tra∣ctet: caeterum instar aliorum Subditorum Excelsi Imperii, uti priùs, pacati sint, & è Moldaviae atque Wallachiae Provinciis, si qui transfugerint, ne recipiantur; si qui aliâ methodo in Poloniae Dominium irrep∣serint, ac postea Provinciam suam pertur∣bare, & corrumpere deprehensi fuerint, similes Homines, quando perquirentur, reddantur, & conditio ista, cùm in antece∣dentibus Capitulationibus clarè, & mani∣festè posita sit, observetur. Pariter & Sub∣ditis Polonis, sive Poloni illi sint, sive Ko∣saci, cujuscunque Nationis extiterint, quan∣do perturbationem afferent, hinc etiam ne∣que recipiantur, neque protegantur, sed retrò reddantur. Et universi, quicunque turbare voluerint Pacem atque Amicitiam, haccine ratione conclusam, ex merito pu∣niantur. XI. Quaecunque conditiones, & Clausulae in antecedentibus Capitulationibus descriptae atque contentae, nullatenus adversantur de recenti conclusis Pactis, neque oppositae sunt liberis, & perpetuis Juribus utriusque Dominii, deinceps etiam colantur, & ob∣serventur, quae verò contrariae sunt, cas∣sentur, & annihilentur, favente & annu∣ente Deo Altissimo. Quae utrinque decla∣ratis, & exaratis Articulis perfectiori, & exactiori ratione conclusa Pax, & Concili∣atio inter Majestates Serenissimi & Poten∣tissimi altè memorati Poloniarum Regis, Domini mei Clementissimi, & Successorum ejus, & Rempublicam Polonam, & ex al∣tra parte Serenissimi, & Potentissimi Mu∣sulmannorum Imperatoris, ejusdemque Hae∣redum, ex voluntate & Clementia Dei per∣petua, stabilis, firma, & inconcussa perma∣neat, & conservata, atque custodita sit ab omni turbatione, & mutatione, & confu∣sione, & violatione, & uno eodemque te∣nore firmissimè perseveret, & constantissimè continuet; & ut omnes omnino hostilitates amoveantur atque sustollantur, quàm ci∣tissimè notitia praebeatur in Confiniis, Prae∣fectis & Gubernatoribus, ut sibi caveant, ne imposterum transgressiones fiant, neve altera pars alteri damna inferat. Verùm enimverò omnes utrinque sincerè & amicè sese praestent juxta istam almam Pacem. Ut autem omnibus cognita, & comperta sit istius almae Pacis Conclusio, triginta dies pro termino ponantur: post quem nullus praetextus, nullaque excusatio ac∣ceptabitur, sed in eos, qui adversabuntur, editis Edictis exactam obedientiam meren∣tibus severissimè animadvertatur. Post Subscriptionem autem Instrumentorum u∣triusque Partis Ablegatus priùs à Polonia missus, & ad Fulgidam Portam veniens, juxta antiquam consuetudinem afferat Re∣gias publicas Literas, Ratificationem Pa∣ctorum Instrumentis declaratorum conti∣nentes, atque Literas Imperatorias ratifi∣catorias item accipiat & deducat; Postea verò ad solennem confirmationem Pacto∣rum Pacis, & perfectionem reciprocae sin∣ceritatis, & absolutam terminationem mu∣tuae Amicitiae, & dispositionem, ac digesti∣onem reliquarum rerum, juxta laudatum veterem morem, adventurus Magnus Le∣gatus, quamprimùm commodè fieri poterit, moveat, ac proinde undecim numero Pactis conclusa juxta istas conclusiones alma Pax ab utraque Parte acceptetur atque colatur. Cùm verò altè memorati Illustrissimi, & Excellentissimi Domini Excelsi Imperii Ple∣nipotentiarii & Commissarii existentes Le∣gati, vi suae Facultatis, & auctoritatis Turcico Sermone exaratum legitimum & validum instrumentum tradiderint, ego quoque vi Facultatis, & Deputationis meae propriâ manu subscriptas, & Sigillo sigil∣latas à me praesentes Pactorum Literas tanquam legitimum, & validum Instrumen∣tum tradidi.
THE TREATY OF PEACE BETWEEN The Most Serene and Most Potent King, AND Republick of POLAND, AND The Sublime OTTOMAN Empire, Made at Carlovitz in Sirmium, in a General Congress of the Confederate Plenipotentiaries. In the Name of the most Holy and Individual Trinity. TO the perpetual Memory of the Thing; Be it known to all and every one, whom it may Con∣cern: Whereas there has been a long War between the Kingdom of Poland, and the Sublime Empire; to stop the Effu∣sion of humane Blood, and with Desires of Restoring a mutual Quiet, the most Se∣rene and most Potent William III. King of Great Britain, France, and Ireland, and the States General of the United Provinces, in order to set on foot this Treaty of a happy Peace, have interpos'd their Medi∣ation, all the Duties and Conditions of which Mediation have with great Study and Industry been perform'd by their Ex∣cellencies the Plenipotentiary Ambassadors to the Fulgid Port, on the behalf of his Britannick Majesty, by William Lord Pagett, Baron de Beaudesert in the County of Staf∣ford, Lord Lieutenant of the said County, and on the part of the States General, by Lord Jacob Colyer; which War, through GOD's Blessing, by Reciprocal Inclinations on both sides, has been Compos'd and wholly Extinguish'd, at Carlovitz on the Confines of Sirmium, where, according to the Designment of the Illustrious Media∣tion, a Congress of the Plenipotentiary Ambassadors was appointed, and Treaties of Articles of Peace begun with the most Illustrious and most Excellent Lord, Meh∣met Effendi, Creat Chancellor of the Sub∣lime Empire, and the most Illustrious and most Excellent Lord, Alexander Mauro Cor∣dato, of the Noble Family of Scarlati, and Privy-Counsellor of the Sublime Em∣pire, Ambassadors Extraordinary for the Treaty of Peace; and after some Sessions, at length, by the Divine Goodness, this
Business of a happy and desir'd Peace was Digested into Terms agreed on both sides, and a most entire Friendship and Peace was Perfected and Concluded, Restor'd and Renew'd, between the most Serene and most Potent Emperor Sultan of the Mu∣sulmen, Sultan Mustapha, Son of Sultan Mehmet, and the most Serene and most Potent King Augustus II. my most Noble Lord, and the Republick of Poland, which Peace is to be Religiously observ'd betwixt both Dominions, and is Digested into Eleven Articles, which follow one by one. I. BY the Help and Blessing of God, Hosti∣lity with the High Empire founded on Eternity, having for some time ceas'd, and now the Ancient Friendship Agreeable to the Nature of Reconciliation and good Neighbour∣hood reviving, that all Acts of Hostility may be prevented, and the Subjects enjoy their Ancient Security, Quiet and Tranquillity, the Ancient Limits shall be establish'd and re∣stor'd to what they were before the two last Wars, and the Confines of the Provinces sub∣ject to Poland, shall by these Ancient Boun∣daries be separated and distinguish'd, as well from the Imperial Confines of Moldavia, as of those of all other Countries subject to the Sublime Empire, nor shall there on either side be any Pretension or Extension made but the Ancient Limits, without Change or Di∣sturbance, shall as Things Sacred, be Reli∣giously observ'd and maintain'd. II. Whatsoever Fortifications or Places; great or less, which before the War, before this lay within the Limits of Moldavia, and have hitherto been in the Possession of Polish Ma∣sters, the Polish Garrisons shall be withdrawn, and they shall be Evacuated, and the Province of Moldavia shall remain as free as ever, and in the same peaceable State it was before the last War. III. The Fortress likewise of Caminiec being before the two last Wars situated within the Ancient Limits towards Poland, shall be Eva∣cuated, and the Musulman Garrison with∣drawn, and shall be entirely left; Nor shall the Sublime Empire hereafter make any Pre∣tensions upon the Provinces of Podolia and the Ukrain; and the Deputy of the Ukrain Cossacks, who goes by the Title of Hatmannus, now residing in Moldavia, shall be remov'd. And considering the Ancient Limits of Po∣land and Moldavia are very plain, if the Season permits, the Evacuations on this side shall be begun by the beginning of the ensuing March, and the Polish Troops shall be with∣drawn out of Moldavia as soon as possible, and the Fortifications and Places shall be Evacuated, and Moldavia left free; And at the same time from the beginning of March, the Evacuation of Caminiec shall Commence, and the Business of the Evacution shall with∣out Hesitation, Neglect, or Delay, be put in Execution, as soon as it can be perform'd; and the said Evacuation of this Fortress of Caminiec, shall at farthest be compleated by the 25th of May, and that the Evacuation of the said Fortress may be perform'd with Speed and Ease; The Poles, shall, as much as possible, in order to the Lading and Carry∣ing away of Goods; assist the Transportation with Carriages and Cattle; and on all hands the Evacuation shall be carry'd on with Se∣curity and Safety: In all which Evacuations of Fortresses, and other Places, in whatsoever manner they are fortify'd, whosoever of the Subjects shall voluntarily desire to depart, may do it securely, and safely, with all their Effects and Goods; and whosoever of 'em have a mind to continue where they are, may in like manner safely do it; and there shall by no means be any Lett or Impediment on either side; and considering the Evacuation of all Fortresses and Places is to be commenc'd in the beginning of March: As to the Affair of leaving behind the Artillery at Caminiec, viz. those that were belonging to it, and were found there; the Polish Envoy that is to be sent to the Fulgid Port, shall lay that Demand before the Throne of the Emperor. IV. None of the Subjects of the Sublime Em∣pire, of whatsoever Condition, especially the Tartars, let 'em be of what Nation soever, shall under the colour of any Pretension or Con∣troversie presume to commit any Hostilities upon the Subjects of the King and Republick of Poland, or upon their Borders; and shall not presume to make Excursions, to take Cap∣tives, to drive away Cattle, or to do any sort of Damage, or give any sort of Distur∣bance, which shall be particularly express'd in Royal Edicts, and commanded to be put in Execution by Visiers, Beglerbegs, and the most Happy Crimean Cham, Carelgaius and Nuradinus, and the other Sultans, and the Weywode of Moldavia, that they, with ut∣most Diligence, secure the Peace, Quiet, and Tranquillity of the Borders; that neither by the Captures of Men, or driving away of Cattle, or by any other Means, the Polish Subject suffer any Losses or Disturbance, and that they make strict and severe Enquiries after the Disturbers and Transgressors of these Conditions of Peace, and when they come to
the knowledge of 'em, they Inflict Punishments upon 'em for Example to Others; and if in these matters any one acts carelessly or negli∣gently, he shall be duly punish'd as is Agree∣able to the Divine Laws. In like manner, the Poles on their part shall carefully observe and prosecute these Conditions of Peace, and let no Man dare to act any thing contrary to 'em. V. Considering the Kingdom of Poland was from Ancient Times entirely Independent, it shall not, by the Sublime Empire, and by any Nations subject to it, under the colour of any Pretension or Demand whatsoever, be disturb'd with any Hostility, nor upon the force of any Compacts of that happy Peace, shall they stand oblig'd to any such Pretensions. VI. In this War, the Budziac and other Tar∣tars, leaving their proper Seats, and entring upon the Lands of the Moldavians, do upon that pretence Exercise Hostilities upon, and Create Disturbances to Moldavia, and its Inhabitants, which being contrary to the Sa∣cred Capitulations formerly granted to the Kings of Poland, for that Reason ought to Cease and be prevented; therefore shall the Tartars be remov'd from all Places and Pos∣sessions, and Lands and Winter-Quarters, whether these were taken from others, or newly rais'd by them, and shall inhabit their Native Places, and live peaceably, and for the time to come Create no Disturbances. VII. The Regulars of the Church of Rome, ac∣cording to the Edicts granted by the Sublime Empire, wheresoever they have Churches, may without hindrance Exercise their usual Functions, and live peaceably; and besides, the Extraordinary Envoy to the Fulgid Port may lay before the Imperial Throne any new Demands upon this Head. VIII. Considering Merchandize is one of the Fruits of Peace, and brings the Provinces into a more thriving Condition; therefore the Merchants of each Party, not practising by any obscure Ways, but going and coming through conve∣nient and open Roads, after they have pay'd the usual and ancient Duty for things Ex∣ported and Imported, shall by no means be burden'd with new Exactions and Demands; nor shall a Duty in ready Money be Exacted; and whatsoever Native Subjects of the Two Polands and Lithuania, and of other Na∣tions subject to them, after this manner coming to exercise their Merchandize, their Buying and Selling, as is declared in former Sacred Capitulations, shall not be troubled with the Exaction of the Tribute call'd Ha∣racz, or any other unusual Exactions: But still with this Proviso, that any resolving to leave their Native Country, and set up their Rest in the Dominions of the Empire, or any Foreigners mixing themselves with Polanders, such shan't to the Detriment of the Govern∣ment enjoy this Exemption. Polish Mer∣chants leaving the War, and returning Home with their Horses and Carriages, and Cap∣tives, having an Authentick Certificate of their Dismission, and being desirous to return to their own Country, shall not be subject to any Exaction, nor shall any Lett or Obstruction be made to Captives thus going away. But still under this pretence, none without leave ob∣tain'd, shall presume to carry away things prohibited. Besides, the publick Officers of Justice shall not pretend to intermeddle in the Confiscation or Distribution of the Goods or Effects of Merchants Subjects to the one, dying in the others Dominions, but they shall be deliver'd into the hands of Merchants of Credit, that according to the Inventory they may be dispos'd of to the Right Heirs: But if any Difference happens betwixt the Mer∣chants themselves, this shall be Decided by the Consul or Chief, and let him be Account∣able to those whom he is subject to: None, contrary to the Divine Laws, shall be Com∣pell'd to pay any Debt, not verify'd in Wri∣ting, or by some Judiciary Instrument; nor shall the Causes of Debts or Contracts be Try'd or Decided by hireling Evidences, be∣cause upon the reading and considering the Divine Precepts, such sort of Suits are to be Decided only by Authentick Instruments and Writings of an Antecedent Date; And so in all Controversies of the like Nature, whatsoever Privileges are intermix'd and establish'd in the Sacred Capitulations, shall, as in the Grants to the other Confederate Na∣tions, be Interpreted and Extended to the Po∣lish Merchants; and besides the true meaning of all Grants by Sacred Edicts, (which are still preserv'd in their hands) particularly indulg'd to the Poles, shall be maintain'd and observ'd. IX. Captives carry'd away in time of War, shall be Releas'd pursuant to the Declaration about this matter in former Capitulations, upon Proofs made according to the Laws, of their Value, or by Oaths that make that manifest, the due Prizes being pay'd. But if the Cap∣tives have serv'd a long time, the Prizes of their Redemption ought to be proportionably
Abated; but if the Master of the Captive cannot be brought to a fair and moderate Price, the Judges of the Places proceeding in a legal Course, shall compose such Diffe∣rences: If after the Conclusion of the Peace, Captives shall be taken out of the Polish Territories, they shall be Dismiss'd without Ransom; Besides, Men going about for the Redeeming Polish Captives; whether in the Kingdoms of the Sublime Empire, or amongst the Tartars, as long as these Men shall be∣have themselves peaceably, they are by no means to be disturb'd, either upon this very pretence, that they make it their Business to deliver Captives, or upon any other Account whatsoever; nay, those that do Disturb 'em, or do 'em any Injury, shall be punish'd: Cap∣tives detain'd in publick Prisons, shall on both sides be Releas'd by Exchange: Farther, the Great Embassy of Poland may present his Demands concerning Captives to the Imperial Throne. X. As long as the most Serene King of Poland shall continue in this establish'd Peace with the Sublime Empire, as is express'd in former Capitulations, the Waywode of Moldavia shall continue to behave himself towards the Kings of Poland in the manner as was anci∣ently us'd: Let the Moldavians remain in Peace like the rest of the Subjects of the Sub∣lime Empire; and if any fly out of the Pro∣vinces of Moldavia, or Walachia, and take Refuge in Poland, they shan't be receiv'd; If any by more Subtle means slide themselves into the Polish Dominions, and shall be af∣terwards found out to Disturb or Corrupt their own Country, such sort of Men, when de∣manded, shall be surrendred up, and this Agreement as it remains, clearly and mani∣festly express'd in former Capitulations, shall be observ'd. The like Measures shall be us'd towards Polish Subjects, whether they be Poles or Cossacks, or of whatsoever Nation, when they shall create any Disturbance, they shall not be receiv'd nor protected on this part, but shall be surrendred up. And in general, whosoever go about to Disturb this Peace and Friendship thus concluded, shall be punish'd according to their Demerits. XI. All Conditions and Clauses describ'd and contain'd in former Capitulations, so far as they are not opposite to the present Compacts, nor contrary to the Independent and perpetual Rights of either Soveraignty, shall hereafter be observ'd and maintain'd; but those that are contrary, shall by the Blessing of the most High God be utterly Abolish'd and Annihi∣lated. Which Peace and Agreement betwixt the Majesties of the most Serene and most Potent highly above-mention'd King of Po∣land, (my most Gracious Lord) and his Suc∣cessors, and the Republick of Poland; and on the other part, of the most Serene and most Potent Emperor of the Mussulmen, and of his Heirs, as it stands concluded in these describ'd Articles, in a more perfect and exact manner; so by the Will and Goodness of God let it remain perpetual, stable, firm; and un∣shaken, and may it be preserv'd and kept from all Disturbance, Change, Confusion and Violation, and so without any Interruption, may it most firmly Persevere, and most con∣stantly Continue, and that all Hostilities may be remov'd and taken away, notice shall as soon as possible be given in the Confines, to all Commanders and Governours, that they take care to themselves, that no Transgressions be committed, and that neither side does Injury to the other; but that in great Sincerity and Friendship, all on each side Comport them∣selves as this happy Peace directs: That the Conclusion of this happy Peace may become known and certain to all, a term of Thirty days are appointed, after which no Pretence nor Excuse shall be receiv'd, but Edicts be∣ing issued, requiring an exact Obedience, who∣soever shall do any thing contrary shall be most severely punish'd. After the Subscrip∣tion of the Instruments of Peace on both sides, an Envoy sent from Poland, and coming to the Fulgid Port, according to Ancient Custom, shall bring the Royal Publick Letters, con∣taining a Ratification of the Pacts declar'd in these Instruments, and likewise shall receive and carry back with him the Imperial Letters of Ratification: But after this, in Order to a more solemn Confirmation of these Agree∣ments, and an absolute Completion of a mu∣tual Friendship, and for a more perfect Dis∣position and Digestion of all other Matters, the great Embassy, that according to Ancient Custom is to be sent, shall, as soon as possi∣ble, set forward; and therefore this happy Peace, compris'd in Eleven Articles, shall on each side be receiv'd and maintain'd. Now in Consideration that the highly men∣tion'd most Illustrious and most Excellent Lords, Plenipotentiaries and Ambassadors Commissionated of the Sublime Empire, have by Virtue of their full Powers and Authority, deliver'd in due Form an Authentick Instrument of this Peace, written in the Turkish Lan∣guage, I likewise by Virtue of full Powers, and my Deputation, have deliver'd the pre∣sent Writing of the said Peace, Subscrib'd with my proper Hand, and Seal'd with my Seal, as a Valid and Authentick Instrument.
TRATTATO DI PACE TRA L'Eccelso Imperio Ottomanno, E LA Serenissima Republica di Venezia. TRattato di Pace tra' l'Eccelso Im∣perio Ottomanno, e la Serenis∣sima Republica di Venezia, con∣chiuso nel Congresso di Carlouiz nel Sirmio sotto le Tende alli 26 di Gena∣ro 1699; essendovi Ambasciatori Pleni∣potenziarii del l'Eccelso Imperio gl'Illustris∣simi & Eccellentissimi Signori Mehemet Ef∣fendi Gran Cancelliere, & Alessandro Mau∣ro Cordato; e per la Serenissima Repub∣lica l'Illustrissimo & Eccellentissimo Sig. Carlo Ruzini Cavalliere; Mediatori gl'Il∣lustrissimi & Eccellentissimi Signori Guliel∣mo Paghet Ambasciatore di Sua Maestà Brittannica, e Giacomo Colyer Ambascia∣tore degli Alti e Potenti Stati Generali delle Provincie Unite: oltre gl'Illustrissimi, & Eccellentissimi Signori Ambasciatori Pleni∣potenziarii di Sua Maestà Cesarea, e di Polonia, &c. I. LA Morea colle sue Citta, Fortezze, Ca∣stelli, Terre, Ville, Monti, Fiumi, Lag∣hi, Boschi, Porti, & ogni altra cosa, che si ritrova dentro la Circonferenza della mede∣sima, ora possessa dalla Republica di Ve∣nezia, resti pacificamente nel possesso, e Dominio dell'istessa Republica, tra'i suoi limiti del Mare, e dell'Essamiglio, ove so∣no li Vestiggi dell'antica muraglia, così che nè dal canto di Morea si faccia veruna estensione nella Terra Ferma, nè dal can∣to della Terra Ferma si faccia alcuna esten∣sione oltre i Limiti della Morea. II. La Terra ferma essendro nel possesso dell'Eccelso Imperio, resta totalmente nel pos∣sesso, e Dominio dell'istesso Imperio, per appunto nello Stato, che si trovava nel principio di questa ultima Guerra. La For∣tezza di Lepanto restarà evacuata dalla Re∣publica di Venezia. Il Castello detto di Rumelia nella parte di Lepanto si demolirà, e si demolirà parimente la Fortezza di Pre∣vesa, e si lasciarà in quella parte la Terra ferma nel suo primiero, & intiero Stato. III. L'Isola di Santa Maura colla sua Fortez∣za, e Capo di Ponte, detto Peracia, senza veruna estensione maggiore in Terra ferma, e l'Isola di Leucade attaccata à Santa Mau∣ra, restaranno nel possesso, e Dominio della Republica di Venezia. IV. LEvacuazione di Lepanto, e la Demoli∣zione del Castello di Rumelia, e di Prevesa, si esseguiranno subito doppo la distinzione de'i Limiti in Dalmazia; & in questo men∣tre per levare tutte le ostilità, & anco lé occasioni di queste, li Presidií de'i detti tr Luoghi si conteneranno dentro, nè faran∣no alcuna escursione nella Terra ferma, nè veruna pretensione per qualsivoglio pre∣testo, e gli Abitanti delli sudetti Luoghi possano restare, e partire, secondo che vor∣ranno, senza usarsi alcuna violenza.
V. Li Golfi, che si trovano frà la Terra ferma, e la Morea restano all'uso commu∣ne, obligandosi l'una, e l'altra parte di conservarli immuni, e franchi da qualsivog∣lia cattiva Gente. VI. Le Isole dell'Arcipelago, e di quei Mari restaranno in quello Stato, che erano avant'il principio di questa ultima Guerra, nel pos∣sesso dell'Eccelso Imperio, nè si pretende∣ranno dalla Republica caraggi, ò siano con∣tribuzioni, od altra introdotto nel tempo della presente Guerra. VII. Per l'avenire l'Eccelso Imperio non pre∣tenderà dalla Republica di Venezia per l'Isola di Zante, nè dalli suoi Abitanti al∣cuna Pensione passata, ò futura. L'Isola di Egina colla sua Fortezza come adgia∣cente alla Morea, e posseduta dalla Re∣publica di Venezia, rimanerà col suo pre∣sente Stato nel possesso, e Dominio del l'istessa Republica. VIII. Nella Dalmazia le Fortezze di Cnin, Sing, e Ciclut, e Gabella, essendo al pre∣sente nel possesso, e Dominio della Repub∣lica di Venezia, restaranno nel pacifico pos∣sesso, e Dominio della medesima; mà poi∣che si devono porre li Limiti in tale forma, che li possessi restino chiari, e li Sudditi di ambe le parti in quiete, e tranquillità, nè si possa venir à qualsivoglia imaginable differenza, che possa in alcuna maniera di∣sturbare la tranquillità delli Confini: si è accordato, che dalla Fortezza di Cnin al∣la Fortezza di Verlika, e da quella alla Fortezza de Sing, e da questa alla Fortezza di Duare detta Zadvaria, e da questa alla Fortezza di Vergoratz, e parimente da questa alla Fortezza di Ciclut, e Gabella, si tirino Linee rette, e si separino li Confini, siche dentro le dette Linee verso il Domi∣nio Veneto, & il Mare tutte le Terre, e li Distritti colli Castelli, Forti, Torri, e Lu∣oghi chiusi, restino nel solo possesso, e Do∣minio della prememorata Republica: e le Terre, e Distritti, che saranno fuori della detta Linea, restino nel possesso, e Domi∣nio dell'Eccelso Imperio, colli Castelli, For∣ti, Torri, e Luoghi chiusi, essistenti in quelli, e non si permetterà per l'avenire alcuna estensione, e dilatazione, ò restriz∣zione nè dall'una, nè dall'altra parte. E le dette Linee secondo l'abilità de'i Luoghi si faranno chiare, e manifeste colli termini ò di Colli, e Boschi, ò di Fiumi, & acque correnti, & ove il luogo non darà l'eviden∣za, si poneranno segni di Fosse, ò Pali, ò Colonne, come frà li Commissarii d'ambe le parti destinati à questa designazione di commune concerto si trovarà à proposito; e perche dette Fortezze nel possesso della Republica habbiano anche in fronte spazio convenienti di Territorio, alle Fortezze di Cnin, Verlika, e Sing, Duare, e Vergo∣ratz, e Ciclut, si assignarà dalli Commissa∣rii lo spazio di un'ora di Paese, con retti∣tudine ò linea semicircolare, conforme lo permetterà, ò lo richiederà la convenienza del Terreno; la Fortezza di Cnin haverà il suo fianco verso le parti della Croazia, sin'al Confine del Cesareo Dominio, senza verun pregiudizio delli trè Dominii, che haveranno in quella parte li termini delli loro Confini, mà si haverà sempre da osser∣varsi il Jus accordato à cadaun di questi trè Dominii per questa universale Pace. La sudetta linea si osservarà dall'una, e dall'altra parte; mà se vicino, ò dentro in quella, venisse à restare qualche For∣tezza dell'Eccelso Imperio, restando nelle spalle di quella il suo Territorio intiero, nella fronte semi-circolarmente haverà da goder il Terreno posto dentro la circonfe∣renza parimente dello spazio d'una ora, e per la Fortezza di Ciclut parimente nella fronte si darà il territorio nello spazio di un'ora, e nel fianco fuori della linea lo spazio di due ore di Terra, tirandosi una linea retta sin'al Mare. Et in questa forma, e regola essendo di∣stinto il Confini, e posti li termini, e sepa∣rate le Terre da possedersi, si osservaranno inviolabilmente, e senza veruna mutazi∣one; e se alcuno mai haverà l'ardire di violare qualche segno, ò di trasgredire qualche termine, e gli Uffiziali ancora, che mancaranno, nella dovuta cura col merita∣to castigo delli delinquenti, tanto dall'una, quanto dall'altra parte, saranno severa∣mente puniti. E se à caso li Commissarii havessero l'incontro di qualche difficoltà, che non potessero accordarsi: informaranno li loro Padroni sinceramente, e realmente, affin∣che cogli Usfizii delli Rappresentanti delle Maestà Cesarea, e Brittannica, e degli alti Potenti Stati Generali delle Provincie Unite presenti alla fulgida Porta si defini∣sca amichevolmente: E per simile od al∣tra qualsivoglia differenza di Confine non si venirà ad alcuna ostilità, nè s'intorbida∣rà la quiete delli Sudditi, nè s'intenderà alterare la Pace conchiusa coll'Eccelso Im∣perio.
IX. Il Territorio, e li Distritti della Signoria di Ragusa saranno continuati colli Territo∣rii, e Distritti dell'Eccelso Imperio, levan∣dosi ogni ostacolo, che impedisce la conti∣nuazione, e la communicazione delle Terre della detta Signoria colle Terre del mede∣simo Imperio. X. Nella vicinanza di Cattaro, Castelnuo∣vo, e Risano, essendo attualmente nel pos∣sesso, e Dominio della Republica di Vene∣zia, restino nel pacifico possesso, e Dominio della medesima Republica, colle lora Terre; e l'istesso s'intènda per qualunque altra For∣tezza in quella parte essistente attualmente nel possesso della medesima. E li Commis∣sarii, che saranno destinati dall'una, e l'al∣tra parte, siino d'esperimentata probità, af∣finche senza alcuna propria passione, giudi∣cando realmente questo importante affare, anco in quella parte separino li Territorii, è li distinguano con evidenti segni, siche si levi l'occasione d'ogni torbidezza, mà da quella parte ancora si avertisca, che non s'interrompa la continuazione intiera delle Terre di Ragusa, con quelle dell'Imperio. XI. Dovendost cominciare la designazione del Confine di ambe le parti in Dalmazía; e nella parte di Cattaro al primo tempo che sarà commodo, li Commissarii Deputati à questa opera corrispondendo con previi avi∣si faranno la loro congiunzione in luogo conveniente, con comitiva di Gente mili∣tare bensì, mà pacifica, e quieta, d'ugual numero, e coll'ajuto d'Idio cominciaranno la loro funzione dal giorno dell'Equinotio de'i 22/12 Marzo dell'anno corrente, & ado∣praranno ogni diligenza nella distinzione dell'uno, e dell'altro Confine delle sudet∣te parti, affinche con prestezza finiscano nel termine di due Mesi, e più presto, se si può fare. XII. Quanto più è desiderata la fermezza dell'amicizia, e la quiete delli Sudditi di ambe le parti, tanto più devono essere u∣gualmente abominati quelli, che portati dal reprobo loro ò genio, ò costume, anco nel tempo di Pace con ladronecci, & altri ostili essercizii intorbidano la tranquillità del Confine, perciò nè dall'una parte nè dall'altra si darà ricetto, ò fomento à tali forusciti di qualsivoglia sorte, mà saranno perseguitati, presi, e consegnati, acciò che ad essempio di altri siino col meritato casti∣go puniti, e sarà per l'avenire proibito l'ap∣poggio, & il mantenimento di questi mali Huomini. XIII. A cadauna delle parti sia lecito di risar∣cire, riparare, e fortificare le posseduto Fortezze, mà non già di fabricarne di nuovo altre Fortezze, appresso il Confine, ò le Fortezze demolite dalla Republica di Venezia nelle Sponde della Terra ferma; Per la commodità però de'i Sudditi sia le∣cito di porre Borghi, e Villaggi per tutto, osservandosi trà di loro pacificamente ogni buona corrispondenza, e vicinanza, e con∣tenendosi nelli proprii termini; e se à caso succedesse frà lora alcuna differenza, subito convenendo li Prefetti del Confine d'ambe le parti amichevolmente, e con ogni giu∣stizia levino l'occasione di qualsivoglia contrasto. XIV. Tanto per la Religgione, e par la liber∣tà, e permuta degli Schiavi, quanto per il Traffico, si osservarà lo Stile, e tenore delle antecedenti Capitolazioni, e sarà le∣cito all'Ambasciatore della Republica di portarne le sue ulteriori istanze al Soglio Imperiale: Intanto circa il Traffico siano confermati anco per questa Pace li sacri commandamenti concessi peravanti alla Re∣publica, & il Traffico haverà da godere la sua forma, che haveva avanti questa ul∣tima Guerra, e li Mercanti della Nazione Veneta tutti li Privileggi, che le sono stati concessi. XV. Sin' al giorno delle immediate Sotto∣scrizzioni frà li Plenipotenziarii dell'Ec∣celso Imperio, e della Republica di Vene∣zia, dal giorno della Sottoscrizzione delli Plenipotenziarii di Sua Maestà Cesarea, e di Polonia dell'accordato per la Repub∣lica, deve cessar ogni ostilitâ d'ambe le par∣ti tanto per Terra, quanto per Mare; & osservarsi ogni buona corrispondenza, & affinche li Rettori di ogni Confine habbia∣no la notizia di questo Armistizio, si pone per le parti di Bosnia, Albania, e Dalmazia il termine di trenta giorni, e per le parti dell'Isola di Candia, e di Morea, e gli al∣tri Confini di quelle parti, si pone il ter∣mine di giorni quaranta, doppo e dentro quali termini al possibile dal canto dell'Eccelso Imperio, e dal canto della Repub∣lica di Venezia non si contravenirà ad al∣cuno di questi Articoli, che si potranno osservare. Si concede inoltre alli Sudditi una vera, & universale amnestia, e qualsivoglia loro fatto, ò delitto commesso in tempo di Gu∣erra, passando in totale oblivione, nissuno di essi, come delinquente, sarà per l'ave∣nire castigato, e molestato.
THE TREATY of PEACE BETWEEN The Sublime OTTOMAN Empire, AND Most Serene Republick of VENICE. THE Treaty of Peace between the Sublime Ottoman Empire, and the most Serene Republick of Venice, concluded in the Con∣gress of Carlovitz in Sirmium, under Tents, the 26th Jan. 1699. The Ambassadors there present on the part of the Sublime Empire, were the most Illustrious and most Excel∣lent Signiore's, Mehmet Effendi, Great Chancellor, and Alexander Mauro Cordato, and on the part of the most Serene Re∣publick the most Illustrious and most Ex∣cellent Signior Charles Ruzini, Kt.

I. THE Morea, with all its Cities, For∣tresses, Castles, Lands, Villages, Moun∣tains, Rivers, Lakes, Woods, Ports, and ev'ry thing else, that is found within the Circumference of it, now in the Possession of the Republick of Venice, shall remain peace∣ably in the Possession and the Dominion of the said Republick, as it stands Bounded by Sea and by Land, by that Line where remain the footsteps of the Antient Wall, so that from within the Morea, that Land shall not be Ex∣tended any farther towards the Terra Firma, nor on the side of the Terra Firma shall they exceed these Limits of the Morea. II. The Terra Firma that is in the Possession of the Sublime Empire, shall remain entirely in the Possession and Dominion of the said Empire, exactly in the State it was in, in the beginning of the last War. The Fortress of Lepanto shall be Evacuated by the Republick of Venice, the Castle of Rumelia on the side of Lepanto, shall be Demolish'd, and like∣wise the Fortress of Preveza shall be Demo∣lish'd, and the Terra Firma on that side shall be left in its first intire State. III. The Isle of St. Maura, with its Fortress, and that Entrance upon the Bridge call'd Pe∣racia, without any farther Extension of it to∣wards the Terra Firma, and the Island of Leucade adjoyning to St. Maure, shall re∣main in the Possession and Dominion of the Republick of Venice. IV. The Evacuation of Lepanto, and the De∣molishment of the Castle of Rumelia, and of Prevesa, shall be perform'd immediately after the Separation made of the Limits of Dalma∣tia; and in the mean time to prevent all Hostilities and all Occasions of Complaint, the Garrisons of the Three said Places shall keep themselves at Home, and shall not make any Excursion into the Terra Firma, nor any De∣mand upon what pretence soever, and the In∣habitants of the said Places may either stay behind, or go away, without any Violence to be us'd towards 'em. V. The Gulphs that are betwixt the Terra Firma and the Morea, shall remain in Com∣mon, and each Party does oblige it self to Clear and Preserve 'em free from Robbers. VI. The Islands of the Archipelago, and of those Seas shall remain in the State they were before the beginning of this last War, in the possession of the Sublime Empire, and the Re∣publick shall not pretend from 'em any Duties
or Contributions, or any thing else introduc'd in the time of the present War. VII. For the time to come, the Sublime Empire shall not pretend from the Republick of Ve∣nice, or from the Inhabitants, any Pension pass'd or future upon account of the Island of Zante. The Island of Egina, with its For∣tress being adjacent to the Morea, and in possession of the Republick of Venice, shall in its present State remain in the Possession and Dominion of that Republick. VIII. In Dalmatia, the Fortresses of Cnin, Sing, Ciclut, and Gabella, being at present in the Possession and Dominion of the Republick of Venice, shall remain in the quiet Possession and Dominion of the same; but because the Limits ought to be put into such a Form, that Possessions may be distinguish'd, and the Subjects of both Parties rest in Quiet and Tranquillity; and that they may not come to any sort of imaginable Difference, which might Disturb the Peace of the Confines, it is agreed, that a streight Line be drawn from the For∣tress of Cnin to the Fortress of Verlika, and from that to the Fortress of Sing, and from that to the Fortress of Duare call'd Zadveria, and from that to the Fortress of Vergoratz, and likewise from that to the Fortress of Ci∣clut and Gabella a streight Line shall be drawn, and thus the Confines shall be sepa∣rated, so that within the Lines towards the Venetian Dominion and the Sea, all the Lands and Districts, with the Castles, Forts, Towers, and inclos'd Places, shall remain in the sole Possession and Dominion of the fore∣said Republick, and the Lands and Districts, which shall be without the said Line, shall re∣main in the Possession and Dominion of the Sub∣lime Empire, with all the Castles, Forts, Towers, and inclos'd Places that are there, and for the time to come no sort of Encroach∣ment, Extension, or Restriction on one side or other shall be permitted: And the said Lines, according to the nature of the Place, shall be made plain and manifest by the Boundaries either of Hills or Woods, or Rivers or Cur∣rents, and where the place won't afford the evidence of such Marks, there shall these Distinctions be made by Ditches, or Pales, or Pillars, as shall be agreed by the Commissaries of both Parties by common consent design'd for this purpose, and that these Fortresses might have in the Front of 'em, a convenient space of Territory; The Commissaries shall assign a quantity of Land of about one Hour (about three miles) to the Fortresses of Cnin, Ver∣lika, and Sing, Duare, and Vergoratz, and Ciclut, to be measur'd either in a right or semicircular Line, according as the Con∣venience and Circumstances of the Land will permit; the Fortress of Cnin shall have its Flank towards the Parts of Croatia, even to the Confines of the Caesarean Dominion, with∣out any prejudice to those Three Potentates, the Boundaries of whose Dominions terminate thereabouts; but the Rights accorded to each of these Three Governments by this Universal Peace shall always be observ'd. The foresaid Line shall be observ'd by each Party, but if in the Neighbourhood of it, or within it, there happens to be any Fortress belonging to the Sublime Empire, which just behind it has an entire Territory belonging to it, then shall it enjoy from the Front the quantity of Land of an Hour, Circumscrib'd within Semicircular Circumference; and as to the Fortress of Ciclut, that shall likewise have from the Front a Territory of one Hour, and in the Flank, besides that Line, the space of two Hours of Land, to be measur'd by a right Line to the Sea. And in this Form, and by this Regulation, the Confines distinguish'd, and the Limits settled, and the Lands of each Possession se∣parated, shall be inviolably observ'd, and without any alteration; and if any one shall have the Boldness to violate these Marks for Boundaries, or commit Trespasses on these Limits; and even Officers that shall be want∣ing of a due Care in punishing Delinquents, shall be severely punish'd, as well on one side as on the 'tother. And in Case the Commissaries shall meet with any Difficulty which they can't Agree, they shall truly and sincerely inform their Pa∣trons, to the end that by the good Offices of the Representatives to the Fulgid Port of their Caesarean and Britannick Majesties, and of the High and Mighty States General of the United Provinces, the matter may be amicably determin'd, and from any such like Difference about the Confines, no Hostilities shall ensue, nor shall the peace of the Sub∣jects be disturb'd, nor shall it be interpreted to break the Peace concluded with the Sublime Empire. IX. The Territory and Districts of the Signory of Ragusa, shall continue joyned to the Terri∣tories and Districts of the Sublime Empire, and all Obstacles shall be remov'd that may hinder the Continuation and Communication of the Lands of the said Signory with the Lands of the foresaid Empire. X. All in the Neighbourhood of Cattaro, Ca∣stelnuovo and Risano, that is actually in the possession and Dominion of the Republick of Venice, shall remain in the peaceable Possessi∣on and Dominion of the said Republick, with
all the Lands appertaining; and this same is to be understood of any other Fortress on that side being now actually in the possession of the said Republick; And the Commissaries that shall be appointed on one side, and the other, shall be Men of an Experienc'd Probity, that they may without partiality and prejudice, equally decide this important Affair; And here two Separations shall be made by evident Signs, that all occasions of Disturbance may be remov'd, but good notice is to be taken, that the said entire Continuation of the Lands of Ragusa be not interrupted. XI. The Distinction of the Limits on both sides in Dalmatia and about Cattaro, being to be set on foot as soon as ever the Season will per∣mit, the Commissaries design'd for this work giving previous Advices, they shall indeed have a Military Attendance, but a peaceable and quiet one, of equal number on each side, and by the help of God they shall enter upon this Office on the day of the Equinox of this instant Year, viz. 12/22 March, and shall in the foresaid Places use all their Diligence in distinguishing and separating one Confine from the other, that they may with Expedition fi∣nish the matter in two Months and sooner if it be possible. XII. As the Continuance of the Friendship and Quiet of the Subjects on both sides is earnest∣ly desir'd, so ought those to be equally abomi∣nated, who, carry'd on by their own ill Dispo∣sition or Custom do in the time of Peace, with Robberies, and other hostile Acts, disturb the Tranquillity of the Confines; therefore no Re∣ception nor Encouragement shall be given to these Banditti of what sort soever by either Party, but they shall be pursu'd, taken, and deliver'd up, that for an Example to others, they may undergo their deserv'd Punishment, and for the time to come all Assistance and Maintenance shall be forbid to be given to such evil Men. XIII. It shall be lawful for each Party to amend, repair, or fortifie the Fortresses in their Pos∣session, but not to build Fortresses a-new near the Confines, or to rebuild the demolish'd For∣tresses of the Republick of Venice, on the sides of the Terra Firma; But for the Con∣venience of the Subjects, it shall be lawful for them any where to erect open Towns or Villages, maintaining peaceably amongst them∣selves good Correspondence and Neighbour∣hood, and containing themselves in their pro∣per Bounds; and if by chance any Difference happens amongst them, the Governours of the Confines for both Parties meeting peaceably amongst themselves, shall with all Justice take away the occasion of any manner of Dispute. XIV. The Ancient Method and the Tenor of the Antecedent Capitulations shall be observ'd as well in the matter of Religion, and Liberty, and Exchange of Slaves, as in Traffick; and it shall be lawful for the Venetian Ambas∣sador to lay his farther Demands on these Subjects, before the Imperial Throne: In the mean time the Sacred Edicts granted hereto∣fore to the Republick, stand also confirm'd by this present Peace and Traffick, shall enjoy the same Form it had before the last War, and the Merchants of the Venetian Nation all the Privileges that have been granted to 'em. XV. All Hostilities shall cease, as well by Land as by Sea, and a good Correspondence be main∣tain'd, as well from the day of the immediate Subscriptions of the Plenipotentiaries of the Sublime Empire, and of the Republick of Ve∣nice, as from the day of the Subscription of the Plenipotentiaries of his Cesarean Majesty and of Poland to this Agreement by the Re∣publick; and that the Governours of the Con∣fines may have notice of this Truce, for the Countries of Bosnia, Albania, and Dalmatia, Thirty days are appointed, and Forty days for the Parts about the Island of Candia and the Morea, and all the other Confines on that side; and after and within those Terms, as far as possible, neither on the part of the Sublime Empire, nor on the part of the Re∣publick of Venice, shall any Contravention be made to these Articles, which can any ways be observ'd. Moreover, by these Presents, a true and universal Amnesty is granted to all Subjects upon the account of any Fact or Crime commit∣ted during the War, all those things shall be pass'd over in Oblivion, nor shall any one for the time to come upon that account be punish'd or molested as a Delinquent.
Extract of a Letter from Constantinople, of the 12/22th of February, 1700. ON the 29th of January, O.S. Count Otting the Emperor's Ambassa∣dor, made his publick Entry here: First, marched the Basha of Nicopoli, with his Retinue, who conducted the Ambassador from Rutsick hither; after him an Oda of Janisaries, with their Aga and Officers; then came the Dutch Ambassadors Gentleman of the Horse, his led Horses, my Lord Pagett's Secretary, with three Gentlemen, and 12 Men in Liveries, all the English Nation; and then followed the Chiousses, Visier Agas, the German Ambassadors Officers, five Led Horses, the Gentlemen Hautboys, Trum∣peters, Noblemen, and he himself on Horseback, having 20 Trabants on both sides, his Drugoman, and the rest of his Retinue: He came in by Adrianople Gate, through part of the City, and out again by Fenar-Gate on the Water-side, so to Ujup, Kehathana; and finally to Pera, where he is lodged in Hattum Hussein Aga's House, not far from my Lord Pagett's. The 3/13th Instant he had his Audience of the Vizier, where he was Clothed with a Sable Vest, and his Gentlemen to the num∣ber of 100 with Caftans. The 6/16th his Excellency went in Pomp to the Sultan: The reason why he had his Audiences so soon, is, because the Turks Ramazan or Lent begins on Friday the 9/19th, and therefore they could not then receive him with the usual Ceremonies. There being here at present more Am∣bassadors than has been seen these 18 years, there passes a great many Visits between them; my Lord Pagett has been the 19th of January to Visit the French Ambassador, and he my Lord the 1st instant; on the 5th my Lord went to the Venetian Ambassador, and the 7th to the Emperors: The 8th, The French Ambassador sent a Gentleman to Count Otting, to Compliment him up∣on his Audience of the Sultan, adding, that he hoped to have the Honour to Salute him, and doubted not but that his Excel∣lency (according to the Custom of this place) would see him before any other Ambassador; upon which Count Otting sent a Gentleman to the French Ambassador to assure him of his Intention to keep Friendship and good Correspondence with him; but as for the Visits, he could not but observe the Custom practised in all the Courts of Christendom, to pay the Visits in the order as they were given him; and as the English Ambassador had first sent to him to felicite his Arrival, and had visited him in Person, he could not but repay him the first Visit; whereupon the French Am∣bassador told the Gentlemen, Je suis faché que de la maniere que les choses sont, je ne puis pas me donner l'honeur de salver son Ex∣cellence; time will shew if he persists in this Resolution. The Venetians are also much Incensed against the Hollander, for having Visited the Imperial Ambassador the first, and thereby Usurped, as they say, their Right of Precedency. I will trouble you further with the De∣scription of my Lord's Cavalcade when he delivered the King's Letters. His Excellency with his Retinue went on Horseback from his Palace to the Water∣side, where 40 Boats, each with 7 Oars on a side, were prepared for the Transporta∣tion of himself and his Retinue: He Em∣barked, and in his passage was Saluted by the K. William and Dalaware, two English Ships then in Port, which had placed themselves in the middle of the River for that purpose: Being landed on the other side, we found our Horses in a readiness, and every thing disposed to begin a regular March: First went six Janisaries, then the Gentlemen of the Nation all mighty well mounted, and their Horses richly ac∣coutred; then 50 of his Excellencies Li∣veries, two and two, his 16 Interpreters, his Gentlemen of the Horses at the Head of 7 led Horses; after that, the Honour∣able Thomas Pagett, encompassed with Foot∣men, two of which held the Reins of his Bridle, he himself carrying the King's Let∣ters at Arms length: After him went his Excellency, preceded by 6 Pages, and sur∣rounded with Heydukes and Selict-Coha∣dars, his Excellencies Gentlemen and Offi∣cers to the number of 30, all well mounted. In this manner we rode through the Prin∣cipal Streets of Constantinople to the Grand Visier's Palace, where his Excellency wa received with all the Demonstrations of Civility and Respect, he himself being first Vessell by the Visier Azem, then such of his Retinue as were thought by his Excellency deserving that Honour. The Ceremony being over, his Excellency re∣turned in the same manner to his Palace, where was prepared a sumptuous Enter∣tainment for all that accompanied him.
On the 16th of February, N. S. the Turkish Ambassador had Audience of the Emperor, and was conducted to the Pa∣lace. The Emperor received him in the Council-Chamber, seated on his Throne under a rich Canopy, and attended by his Principal Ministers of State, and other Persons of the first Quality: The Ambas∣sador when he entred the Room, made a low Reverence, another in the middle of the Chamber, and the third near the Throne. He went up the Steps of the Throne, presented his Credentials, and laid them on the Table that was before the Emperor, and then returned to the Place, where he made his Speech in his own Lan∣guage, containing an Assurance of the Sul∣tan his Master's Friendship, and sincere In∣tentions, strictly to observe the Treaty between the two Empires lately conclu∣ded, which being interpreted by the Sieur Della Torre, the Emperor commanded Count Caunitz, Vice-Chancellor of the Empire, to return an Answer, which he accordingly did in High Dutch, and the same was Interpreted to the Ambassador by the Sieur Della Torre. Then the Am∣bassador ordered hi Steward to bring in the Grand Signior's Presents; a List of which he laid upon the Table, with a Letter from the Grand Vizier, and going once more up the Steps to the Throne, kissed the Border of the Emperor's Robe, his Attendants at the same time ma∣king a very low Reverence. After which the Ambassador withdrew, walking back∣wards while he was in the Emperor's Pre∣sence, and making three Reverences in like manner as when he came into the Room, and was reconducted to his House, and nobly entertained.

The Last Account of Count TEKELY. TEKELY was a Count of the Kingdom of Hungary, and one of the most Ancient Families thereof, and one of the most Zealous Professors, and Assertors of the Protestant Religion, which caused him to joyn with the Turks, through the whole Course of the last Wars, of which we have given an ample Account in the due places of this History, whereby appear the great Services which this Noble Person did them, and how ill and barbarously they sometimes used him. I have particularly instanced how this present Sultan being at Belgrade, where having occasion for this Tekely's Services, he sent a Capugi-bashee or two, to fetch him thither from Constantinople, where he had Lodged himself for Recovery of his Health, being informed by the Physicians at Con∣stantinople, that the Air of that City was much better than that of Adrianople. The Officers who are sent from the Grand Seig∣nior to execute any of his Commands, do commonly perform them without any Consideration, or Ceremony, or Respect to the Person to whom they are sent, and so they did to Tekely, whom finding in his Bed, labouring under a grievous Fit of the Gout, they rudely forced him to arise, and without any Remorse, threw him into a Waggon, and hurried him away to Bel∣grade, to receive such Commands as the Grand Seignior had to employ him in; and on all Occasions as the hopes of a Peace appeared, the Neglects put upon him did daily increase. It is commonly the Humour of the Turks, after they have done with the Ser∣vice of any Person, never more to treat them kindly, nor if they can to suffer them to Live: Of which we have a fresh Instance by Letters of the 15th of July last from Constantinople, which tell us, That the Chimacam of that place had re∣ceived an Express Command, or Decree, from the Sultan, to Exile or Banish Tekely, into some Island of the Archipelago. At the first coming of this News Tekely was strangely Surprised, and was half Dead with the Apprehensions thereof; the Remembrance of his Journey to Belgrade, and Terrours thereof, were scarce out of his Mind, before another Scene of Banishment was presented to him, into an Island where was no Sustenance fit for his Weak Indi∣sposed Body, nor no Consolation, or Com∣fort to be expected from Society, or Con∣versation of Mankind; nor yet from his Wife neither, who, poor Lady, by this hard Usage, was struck with an Astonish∣ment, and both joyned together in their loud Exclamations against the Ingrati∣tude, and Tyranny of Princes, who have no Tenderness of Compassion for any but themselves; for if they had had, they would never have exposed two such Noble Families unto Ruine and Destruction. After all which Hardship, it is believed, that the Turks will scarce suffer them to ar∣rive unto the Place of their Banishment, but by the way take their Lives, as hath been the Practise commonly amongst the Turks on the like Occasions. And this sad Account shall suffice to put an end to the many Tragedies of this History. FINIS.
