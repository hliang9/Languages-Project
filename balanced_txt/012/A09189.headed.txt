¶To all persons whom these presents may concerne, of what estate and degree soeuer. NO man may arrogate to himselfe the name and title of a perfect and absolute Surueior of Castles, Man∣ners, Lands, and Tenements, vnlesse he be able in true forme, measure, quantitie, and proportion, to plat the same in their particulars, ad infinitum, and thereupon to retriue, and beat out all decaied, con∣cealed, and hidden parcels thereof, fitting the same to their euidence, how ancient soeuer; although blemished, obliterate, and very much worne: besides the quickening and reuiuing of Rents, Customes, Li∣berties, Priuileges, &c. thereunto belonging: with perfect knowledge of customarie Tenures and Titles of all sorts: framing Entries accor∣dingly: together with good and commendable penmanship, as well for the Plat, as Booke, from the same. And for that more abuse in concealments, incroachments, &c. hath beene offered in these last 100. yeeres, than in 500. before, and that many doe now refuse (as more heereafter will) to pay their rents and duties, otherwise than on the meeres head (their Lands and Tenements first singled out, and set foorth vnto them, metis & bundis) I may not terme him so much as a Surueyer, that performeth not these difficulties, and such like inci∣dent to Suruey. By Radulph Agas of Stoke next Nayland in Suffolck. Practised in Suruey more than 40. yeeres.
