WHereas vpon the returne of Our Fleete from Spaine, Wee did direct and appoint, that none of Our Souldiers imployed in that Seruice, and which should returne in any of those Shippes, should be disbanded or departed from their Colours, but remaine and conti∣nue vnder the command of those vnder whom they serue, Wee ha∣uing occasion then and yet to vse their seruice againe, and yet We were inforced for a time to Lodge and Billet the said Souldiers in seuerall Counties and places neere adioyning vnto the Sea-Coasts, where with most conueniency for the Souldiers, and least trouble to the Countrey, it might best be per∣formed, vntill We should haue opportunity to employ them. Now, to the intent the said Souldiers may bee exercised, Trained, and kept in good Or∣der, for the better performance of Our Seruice when occasion shall require, We do hereby pub∣lish and declare Our Royall pleasure to be, And Wee doe straitly charge and command all & euery the Captaines, Lieutenants, Corporals, and other Our Officers, who haue the command of any of Our Troupes or Companies, or any part of them, which were the remainder of Our Armie that returned from Spaine; That foorthwith they and euery of them doe repaire to their seuerall Troupes and Companies, as they tender Our pleasure, and will answere the contrary at their perils: And that all and euery the Souldiers being in Our Pay, who are from their Colours, do foorthwith, vpon paine of death, repaire vnto such Captaine or Captaines, or other Officers vnder whose Command they formerly serued, and there continue in Our Seruice vntill they shal be lawfully discharged.

warning; That then they send and conuey such Souldier or Souldiers, so negligent, as aforesaid, from Constable to Constable, vntill he shall be brought to his owne Company. And for the pre∣uenting of all disorders, which otherwise may be committed, it being feared, that there being soul∣diers in entertainment, many lewd persons vnder the colour of that name, doe, and will wander as Rogues and Vagabonds, wherby much harme and preiudice may ensue to Our louing Sub∣iects: We doe hereby strictly charge and command all and singular Maiors, Sheriffes, Iustices of Peace, and other Our Officers and Ministers aforesayd, That they finding any such Rogues, Vagabonds or disordered persons, vnder the name of souldiers, or otherwise, they send them from Constable to Constable, vntil they come to the place where they were borne, there to remaine: And Wee doe giue strict charge and command to all and euery Constable and Constables, and other Our Officers to be diligent and attendant in conueying & conducting such Rogues, Vagabonds and disordered persons, which from time to time shalbe committed to their care and charge to bee conueyed as aforesaid, and in the due execution of Our command, concerning the premisses, as they tender their duetie and Allegiance to Vs, and the peace, and the good of their Countrey, and wil answere for the contrary at their vttermost perils. And lastly Our will & pleasure is, and We doe hereby publish and declare, That if any person or persons, who haue heretofore serued in the Warres, and not in Our entertainment, or any others who are desirous to serue, will voluntarily present him or themselues to the Commissioners in any of Our Counties, wherein the said Troupes are billeted, they shall bee there receiued into Our Pay.
