❧ By the King. FOrasmuch as the Kings Maiestie, in his Princely disposition to Iustice, hauing euer a speciall care and regard to haue repressed the slaughters, spoyles, robberies, and other enormities which were so frequent and common vpon the Borders of these Realmes, and to haue reduced and settled the said Borders vnto a perfect obedience, to the comfort of his Highnesse peaceable Subiects: The course whereof hath bene heretofore impeded by the difference of the Borders, English and Scottish, till it hath now pleased Almighty God, in his great blessing to this whole I stand, by his Maiesties lawfull suc∣cession to the Imperiall Crowne of England, not onely to remoue this difference, but also to furnish his Highnesse with power and force sufficient to prosecute that his Maiesties Royall and worthy resolution, as his Highnesse hath already begunne, entending that the bounds possest by those rebel∣lious people, being in fertilitic and all other benefits nothing inferiour to many of the best parts of the whole Ile, shall be no more the extremities, but the middle, and the Inhabitants thereof reduced to perfect obedience: Yet notwithstan∣ding, as his Maiestie is enformed, certaine disordered and wicked persons of both Marches, Enemies to Peace, Iustice, and quietnesse, pretending ignorance of his Maiesties resolution for the vnion of the two Realmes, already settled in the hearts of all his good Subiects, and feeding themselues with a smister conceit and opinion, that no such vnion should be established and take effect, still continue in all hinde of robbery and oppression, whereunto they are encouraged by the re∣ceipt and harbour granted vnto them, their wiues, children, goods and geir in the Inland and peaceable parts of both the Realmes, highly to his Maiesties contempt, and frustrating of his Highnesse Commission graunted to the effect aforesayd. And therefore his Maiestie for the better satisfaction of all his good Subiects, who may stand in any doubt of the sayd Vnion, and to take away all pretence of excuse from wicked and turbulent persons, hath hereby thought good to publish and make knowen to all those to whose knowledge these presents shall come, That as his Maiestie hath found in the hearts of all the best disposed Subiects of both the Realmes of all qualities, a most earnest desire, that the sayd happy Vnion should bee perfected, the memory of all preterite Discontentments abolished, and the Inhabitants of both the Realmes to be the Subiects of one Kingdome: so his Highnes will with all conuenient diligence with the aduice of the Estates and Parliament of both the Kingdomes make the same to be perfited. And in the meane time till the sayd Vnion be established with the due solemnitie aforesayd, his Maiestie doth hereby repute, hold, and esteeme, and commands all his Highnes Subiects to repute, hold, and esteeme both the two Realmes as presently vnited, and as one Realme and King∣dome, and the Subiects of both the Realmes as one people, brethren and members of one body: And in regard thereof, that euery one of them abstaine and forbeare to commit any kinde of Robbery, Bloodshed, or any other insolence or disor∣der, or to receiue and harbour the Persons, Wiues, Children or Goods the Fugitiues and Outlawes of either of the Realmes, but to conteine themselues inpeace and quietnes, and all such dutifull behauiour as becommeth good and loyall Subiects, certifying all and euery person who shall doe, practise, or attempt any thing to the violating of these Presents, that they shall incurre the punishment due to the sayd Rebels, and that the same shall be executed against them with all rigor and extremity to the terror of others. Giuen vnder our Signet at our Manour of Greenewich, the nineteenth of May 1603. God saue the King. ¶ Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most excellent Maiestie.
