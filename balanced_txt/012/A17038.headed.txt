The Summe of Christian RELIGION. Question. WHerein standeth a mans true hap∣pinesse? Answere. In the recouery of Gods fauour by Christ, which we lost by the fall of Adam and Eue, our first parents. Q. What was their estate by creation? A. They were created after the image of God, in wisedome, holinesse, and righteous∣nesse, Gen. 1. 26. Col. 3. 10. Ephes. 4. 24. They enioyed the pleasures of Paradise, and the plenty of the world, without any griefe of minde, or paine of body: They were free from death, so long as they were free from sinne. Q. How sinned they?
A. The diuell in the serpent entised the woman, and she the man, to eat of the fruit forbidden vpon paine of death, Ioh. 8. 44. Genes. 3. 1. Q. Was the eating of that fruit a great and hainous sinne? A. Yea, in many respects; for our parents beleeued not Gods threatning, and so made him a liar, 1. Ioh. 5. 10. They trusted not in his goodnesse, but esteemed him enuious, as one that withheld good things from them; but the deuill was beleeued, and esteemed a kinde friend. They shewed deuillish pride, and vile ingratitude. They became rebels against their gracious God. Q. What hurt receiue we by this their fall? A. Hereby all mankinde is defiled with sinne, originall and actuall, and therefore is vn∣der the wrath and curse of God, Ro. 5. 12. Q. What is originall sinne? A. The sinne of Adam iustly imputed to vs all, Rom. 5. 19. Heb. 7. 10. together with the corruption of our nature thence ensuing. For by Adams fall, mans minde is darkened, his wil is become rebellious, his affections world∣ly, or brutish or deuillish, his conscience hard or erroneous, and his whole nature infected,
as it were with poison, Genes. 5. 3. and 6. 5. Ephes. 4. 17, 18. Q. How doth this appeare? A. Because euery natural man is void of the true knowledge of God, and of himselfe, and of the way of true happinesse. He is full of er∣ror, Ierem. 10. 14. 1. Corinth. 2. 14. He hath no power, nor true desire to repent, to beleeue, or to obey, 2. Corinth. 3. 5. Hee is prone to al euill, vnapt to any good, vnder the power and strong chaines of sinne, and the bondage of the deuill, Ephes. 2. 1, 2. Tit. 3. 3. Q. What is actuall sinne? A. The actuall transgression of any of Gods Commandements, 1. Ioh. 3. 4. Q. What punishments are due to man for sinne, originall and actuall? A. 1. All corporall punishments, as war, fa∣mine, pestilence, and other diseases, and all bo∣dily torments, inflicted by God or man, Deut. 28. 2. All spirituall punishments, as to be giuen ouer of God, to our owne blindnesse and hard∣nesse of heart, and to the seducement of the deuill and his instruments, Exod. 7. 3. Rom. 1. 24, 26. 2 Thessalon. 2. 9, 10, 11. 3. Besides these temporall punishments,
the endlesse and intolerable torments of hell, are the due desert of our sinnes, Genes. 2. 17. Rom. 6. 23. Ephes. 5. 6. Q. How may we be deliuered from this hor∣rible estate into which we are fallen, and recouer Gods fauour, and that blessed estate from whence we are fallen? A. Gods loue and fauour may be recoue∣red by his Sonne Iesus Christ, if being rightly prepared we come vnto him, Matth. 11. 28. Q. How may we be rightly prepared to come vnto Christ? A. Gods Law contained in the Ten Com∣mandements, must be our Schoolemaster; it will bring vs vnto Christ, if wee rightly vn-t¦derstand it, and make vse of it, Rom. 3. 20. Gal. 2. 19. Gal. 3. 24. Q. How may wee rightly vnderstand these Commandements? A. By obseruing two things: Frst, that eue∣ry Commandement doth command things good, and forbid things euill, Psal. 34. 14. Se∣condly, that euery commandement doth for∣bid not only grosse sins, but also those which the world accounteth small sinnes, or no sins at all, Math. 5. 19. Ephes. 5. 4. 1. Thess. 5. 22. Iude v. 23.
Q. How are the Commandements to bee di∣uided? A. Into two Tables: The first containing mans duty towards God; the second his duty towards his neighbour. Q. Which is the first Commandement? A. Thou shalt haue none other Gods but me. Q. What is here commanded, and what forbid∣den? A. This first Commandement containeth all inward duties of the heart towards God: As to know him, and choose him, to loue and to feare him aboue all, to trust in him, to pray to him faithfully, to giue him thanks sincerely Marke 12. 30. 1 Sam. 12. 24. Psal. 50. 14, 15. Heere wee are not onely forbidden to be a∣theists. Psal. 14. 1. Tit. 1. 16. to haue the gods of the Heathen for our God, Ier. 2. 11, 12. or to seeke helpe and comfort from the deuill, by witchcraft ahd sorcery, Leuit. 19. 31. but the least withdrawing of our hearts from God is here forbid, 1 Chr. 22. 5. 2 King. 20. 13. Ier. 17. 5. and the setting of our hearts on riches, plea∣sures, and vaine-glory, 1 Ioh. 2. 15, 16. Eph. 5. 5. 2 Tim. 3. 4. all wandering thoughts at the time of prayer, preaching, and other holy exercises,
Eccles. 4. 17. Esay 29. 13. Iam. 5. 16. Also to feare man more than God; as al they doe that commit those sinnes secretly, which they will not commit openly, Iob 24. 15. So euery passion of wicked griefe, or desire, or ioy being against the loue of God, is against this Commandement, Matt. 2. 3. Nehem. 2. 10. Genes. 27. 41. Iud. 18. 20. Luke. 22. 5. Q. Then belike they deceiue themselues, that thinke this Commandement easie to bee kept, and that they can and doe keepe it. A. Doubtlesse they are greatly deceiued, for this Commandement is ofter broken than any other, and whichsoeuer Commandement a man breaketh, he breaketh this withall: for in euery sinne a man erreth from that loue and feare which hee oweth to God, Leuit. 19. 3, 4, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 24, 28, 30, 31, 32, 34, 36, 37. Q. Which is the second Commandement? A. Thou shalt not make to thy selfe, &c. Here we are taught, how to worship God outwardly; that we doe it truly according to his word, and also diligently, and reuerently, Deu. 12. 32. Ioh. 4. 24. Gen. 18. 16, 17. Eccles: 4. 17. God here forbiddeth not only images, but all other false and superstitious worship, with
all drowsinesse, negligence, and all vnreuerent behauiour in his seruice, Math. 15. 9. Ierem. 48. 10. Q. Which is the third Commandement? A. Thou shalt not take the Name, &c. Here we are commanded to talke often of Gods Maiesty, of his Word, and of his works, and that with all reuerence, and in our talke to defend truth and vertue, Deutero. 6. 6. Ezra. 8. 22. God here forbiddeth, not onely blasphe∣my, profane swearing, and cursing, but also all foolish and idle talking of his Maiesty, and all profane maintayning of sinne and error of his word, or of his workes, Matth. 5. 34. Iob 33. 8, 9, 10, 11. Iob 38. 2. and 39. 37, 38. Iob 42. 3. Ephes. 4. 29. Col. 4. 6. Q. Which is the fourth Commandement? A. Remember that thou keepe holy, &c. We are here commanded to bestow Gods Sabbath in holy exercises, both publike and priuate; as in hearing, reading, praying, sing∣ing, meditating. God here forbiddeth, not only the labours of husbandry, handicrafts, and such like, but also iournies on the Lords day, paying and also receiuing sums of money, following of Law
businesse, making of bargaines, idlenesse, and the choking of heauenly and spirituall de∣lights, by those that on this day specially, giue themselues ouer to carnall pleasures and pa∣stimes, Esay 58. 13. Act. 20. 7. 1 Cor. 16. 2. Reu. 1. 8. Neh. 13. 15. Q. What is the fruit of such profaning of the Sabbath? A. Barbarous and heathenish ignorance, and all manner of wickednesse. Q.

By this Commandement, children, seruants, and all inferiours, must honour, that is, loue, re∣uerence, and obey, their parents, masters and other superiours: And parents, & masters, are commanded to traine vp their children, and seruants, in godlinesse; and Magistrates to go∣uerne, Ministers to instruct the people, as care∣full & tender fathers. The contrary sins, grea∣ter or lesse, are here forbidden, Eph. 5. 22, &c. Col. 3. 18, 19, 20. 21, 22. & 4. 1. Rom. 13. 1. 1. Pet 2. 13, 14. Psalm. 78. 71, 72. Hebr. 13. 17. 1 Pet. 5. 1, 2, 3. Q. Which is the sixt Commandement? A. Thou shalt doe no murther. We are here commanded, to performe all
works of mercy towards our neighbour, both for body and soule, Esay 58. 7. 1 Thess. 5. 14. Matth. 25. 35. Not only killing, but also wounding, figh∣ting, quarrelling; al malice, all vnaduised anger, and all cruelty, in thought, word, or deed, are here forbidden, Matt. 5. 22. 1 Cor. 13. 4, 5, 6. 1 Ioh 2. 11. and 3. 15. Q. Which is the seuenth Commandement? A. Thou shalt not commit adultery. Here all chastity of body and minde is com∣manded, with a settled and constant resoluti∣on, neuer to defile our selues, Iob 31. 1. 1. Cor. 7. 34. 1 Thess. 4. 4. Not only fornication and adultery are here forbidden, but also all wanton desires and pur∣poses, all vnchaste speeches, songs, gestures, sporting, and dalliance, with all degrees, allure∣ments, and occasions of wantonnesse, to the corrupting of our selues and others, Gen. 38. 14. Gen. 39. 7. 2 King. 9. 30. Prou. 7. 10, 11, 12. 13. Matt. 5. 28. Mar. 6. 22. 1 Thess. 5. 22. Ephes. 5. 4. Q. Which is the eighth Commandement? A. Thou shalt not steale. Wee are here commanded to labour with body or minde, for our owne maintenance,
and the reliefe of others, Ephesians 4. 28. 2 The. 3. 10. Not only robbing or stealing things of value, but also the fraudulent taking of any, the least thing that is not ours; all false weights and measures, bribery, all deceit in bargaining, all gaine with the iniury and hurt of our neigh∣bour, and all desires and purposes tending thereto, are here forbidden, Mat. 7. 12. 1 Thess. 4. 6. Q. Which is the tenth Commandement? A. Thou shalt not beare false witnesse, &c. The preseruing of our neighbours good name is here commanded, Prouerbs 22. 1. Eccles. 7. 3.

The first motions of sin against our neigh∣bour, euen without the consent of the will are here forbidden, Rom. 7. 7. Q. I heare no mention of the sin of drunkennes, doth no commandement forbid this sin? A. Yes, for drunkennes is a cause of many sins, and drunkards sin either directly or by consequence against euery Commandement. Q. How sin they against the first, second, third, and fourth Commandements? A. They loue pleasures more then God, they neglect the outward seruice of God, they are commonly great swearers, and Sabbath breakers. Q. How sin they against the Commandements of the second table? A. They disobey parēts, masters, Magistrates and Ministers, they often brawle and fight, and sometimes kill or wound; many of them resort to wicked houses, not only for drinke, but for whoredome also. They deceiue their Creditors, and begger their owne wiues and Children. They are railers and slanderers, all concupiscence raignes in them, and they omit all maner of duties to God and their neigh∣bour. Q. But who are drunkards?
A. Not only they that reele, or are void of reason, but all riotous and idle tipling Compa∣nions, that for loue of drinke do liue in the forenamed sins, or in any of them. Q. Thou saidst, that the Law is a schoole-ma∣ster to bring vs vnto Christ, if we can make right vse of it. Shew me then what vse is to be made of these Commandements? A. By these, the wicked are taught to see and discerne their owne wickednesse, in that they doe not keepe any of Gods Lawes, nor truly endeuour to keepe them, but that they daily and hourely rebell against God, and so are vnder the power of sinne and Satan their master, and in the ready way to be damned for euer with him, Romans 3. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18. Eph. 2. 1, 2. 2. Cor. 4. 4. 2. Tim. 2. 26. Deut. 27. 26. Q. Yea, but this Doctrine is grieuous and vn∣comfortable. A. So it is to the wicked, but it is whole∣some for them if they will receiue it; for vnfai∣ned sorrow is the onely way to true comfort: If we labour and bee heauy laden with our sinnes, Christ inuiteth vs to come vnto him, wlth promise to ease vs, Matthew 11. 28. Iohn 3. 16. 1 Tim. 1. 15.
Q. After that we are come vnto Christ, is there no more vse to be made of these Commande∣ments? A. Yes, for they serue as a rule to the god∣ly, whereby they measure all their actions, yea, their words, and al their inward thoughts and affections, Psal. 18. 21, 22, 23. Psal. 19. 11. and 119. 1, 9. and where they finde themselues to swarue and decline, though neuer so little, from this rule, they bewaile their infirmity, and stir vp their repentance, 2 Sa. 24. 10. Mat. 26. 75. Rom. 7. 22, 23. Q. How doth the Law of God bring a man vnto Christ? A. By shewing him his misery, that hee may sue to Christ for mercy, Matt. 9. 12. Q. And what then doth Christ for him? A. He worketh in him true repentance and a liuely faith, Q. What is true repentance? A. It is a supernaturall change of the heart, and of the thoughts, words and deeds, from infidelity to faith, from disobedience to obe∣dience & from all sins to the contrary vertues, Math. 3. 2. and 4. 17. Rom. 12. 2 Eph. 4. 22. &c Math. 3. 8. Acts 26. 18. A. What is a liuely faith?
A. A supernaturall gift of God, Ephes. 1. 19. 20. and 2. 8. Math. 16. 17. whereby a sinner be∣leeuing Gods promises in Christ, is vnited with him, Ioh. 6. 33, 56. Ioh. 15. 5. Rom. 6. 3, &c. Gal. 2. 20. Eph. 1. 22. 23 Hos. 2. 19. Eph. 5. 30. is iustified and sanctfied Gen. 15. 6. Act. 15. 9 and draweth neere to God for deliuerance from all euil, and the obtayning of all good. Rom. 5. 1. 2 Eph. 3. 12 Heb. 4. 16 and 10. 22. Gen. 15. 1. Q. On whom is this gift bestowed? A. Only vpon the elect, Act. 13. 48. Tit. 1. 1. Ioh. 12. 39, 40. Q. How is faith wrought? A. By Gods Word and Spirit. Q. How by the Word? A. Gods Word sheweth vs, whence and how grieuously we haue fallen, and what meanes God hath ordained to restore vs, Rom. 1. 16. and 10. 17. Q. How by the Spirit? A. The Holy Ghost worketh effectually on them that are to be saued, inlightning their darke mindes, softning their hard hearts, cau∣sing them cleerely to discerne, and carefully to regard the things which the word teacheth; to tremble at Gods iustice, and their owne hainous deserts; highly to prize Christ the
Redeemer, to esteem all things drosse & dung in comparison of him, & neuer to rest till God by Christ hath receiued them into fauour, Act. 16. 14. Ier. 31. 33. Eze. 11. 19. Eph. 2. 1. Ioh. 6. 44, 45. Deut. 30. 6. Q. In what case are they that heare the Word without this working of the Spirit? A. Seeing they see not, hearing they heare not, they discerne not their owne filthinesse, nor the wrath of God abiding on them; they value Christ beneath their earthly riches and pleasures, Deut. 29. 3, 4. Es. 6. 9. Matt. 13. 13. Matth. 19. 22. Mark. 5. 17. Matth. 22. 2. Q. What is their estate in whom God by his Word and Spirit worketh this faith? A. By this faith they receiue Christ, they liue the life of grace, they are iustified, and san∣ctified, they please God, they are made the children of God, they ouercom the world and the deuill, and obtaine eternall saluation, Ioh. 1. 12. Hab. 2. 4. Gen. 15. 6. Act. 15. 9. Heb. 11. 5, 6. 1 Ioh. 5. 4. Ephes. 6. 16. 1 Pet. 1. 9. Q. But many that beleeue, liue wickedly, and are ouercome of the world and the deuill. A. They haue but an historicall faith, a dead faith, a faith of deuils, which cannot profit them, I am. 2. 14, 19, 26.
Q. What are the things which thou doest be∣leeue? A. I beleeue whatsoeuer is contained in the Scriptures, the chiefe points whereof are con∣tained in the Articles of the Christian saith. Q. Rehearse those Articles. A. I beleeue in God the Father Almightie, &c. Q. What learnest thou in generall out of these Articles? A. Three things. 1. How to beleeue rightly. 2. How to liue godly. 3. How to cheere vp my heart ioyfully. Q. First then shew me how thou learnest hence to beleeue rightly: & that thou mayst proceede in order, tell me how these Articles may be diuided. A. Into foure parts. 1. Wee are taught what to beleeue concerning God the Father: 2. Concerning God the Sonne: 3. Concerning God the Holy Ghost: 4 Concerning Gods Church, and the priuiledges thereto belong∣ing. Q. Seeing there is but one God, why namest thou Father, Sonne, and holy Ghost? A. These three seuerall persons are all but one and the same God, Deut. 6. 4. Matth. 3. 16. 2 Cor. 13. 13. 1 Ioh. 5. 7.
Q. VVhat meanest A more exact definition, but obscure, is this. A person is a substance reasonable, incom∣municable, whole, and not subsisting in another: Therefore no qualitie, and nothing void of life or rea∣son, is a person. God or man, or Angell in generall is no person. Mans body alone, or his soule alone; or Christs man-hood without his God-head, is no person. thou by a person? A. One man, as Peter, one Angell, as Gabriel is a person: So in the God-head, the FATHER is One Person, the SONNE Another, & the HO∣LY GHOST Ano∣ther distinct Person. Q. Which is the first part of the Creed? A. I beleeue in God the Father Almighty, maker of heauen and earth. Q. What meanest thou by this, I beleeue in God? A. This I meane, Gods Spirit assureth me that God loueth me, and will blesse me both in this world and in the world to come, Rom. 8. 15, 16. Galat. 2. 20. 2. Tim. 4. 8. 1 Tim. 4. 8. Q. Whose Father is God? A. The Father of Christ, and of all the faithfull, Ioh. 20. 17. Q. What beleeuest thou of this God & Fathers A. That he is a Spirit, Ioh. 4. 24. infinite in power, and likewise in wisdome, justice, mer∣cy, truth, and euery way, Gen. 17. 1. Exo. 3. 14.
Exod. 34. 6. Iob 12. 13. 1 Tim. 1. 17. and 6. 15, 16. Q. How doth this appeare? A. In that he made heauen, earth, and all therein, all of nothing, Gen. 1. 1. all very good, Gen. 1. 31. and all for his owne glory, Prou. 16. 4. Rom. 11. 33. Q. If God made all good, how is it that deuils and vngodly men are so wicked? A. God made them good, but by their fall they haue made themselues wicked, Ioh. 8. 44. Iude 6. Eccles. 7. 31. Gen. 3. 6. Q. How doth it further appeare that God is in∣finite? A. In that he gouerneth the world and all things therein by his wonderfull prouidence, Prou. 16. 33. Matt. 10. 29, 30. Q. If God doth gouerne all by his prouidence, how is it that the godly oft mourne, and the wicked oft reioyce? A. God wil turn the sorrowes of the godly into ioy, and the ioyes of the wicked into sor∣row, Luke 6. 20. 24. Luke 16. 25. Iohn 16. 20. and in the meane time, the godly doe profit by their afflictions, Psal. 119. 67, 71. 2 Cor. 4. 17, 18. Hebr. 12. 11. Q. Rehearse the second part of the Creede. A. And in Iesus Chrst, that is, I beleeue in
Iesus Christ his only Sonne our Lord, &c. Q. What is Iesus Christ? A. God Almighty, and man consisting of soule and body. Q. Why must he be God? A. That he might be able of himselfe to satisfie Gods iustice for all our sinnes, to me∣rit heauen for vs, to send vs the Holy Ghost, to ouercome sinne, death, Satan, tyrants, and all the mighty enemies of his Church, Psal. 98. 1. Heb. 1. 3. Heb. 7. 25. Act. 20. 28. Q. Why must he be man? A. That he might suffer for man, and that he might pittie vs, hauing had experience of our miseries, Heb. 2. 16, 17, 18. and 4. 15. Q. Which Person of the three became man? A. God the Sonne, the second Person in the Trinitie, Ioh. 1. 14. Ioh. 3. 16. Q. What doth IESVS signifie? A. A Sauiour, because he only saueth his people from their sinnes, Matth. 1. 21. Acts 4. 12. Q. What doth Messiah or Christ signifie? A. Anointed, for God by his Spirit an∣ointed Him to bee our King to gouerne vs, our Priest to offer vp Himselfe for a Sacrifice, and to make intercession for vs, our Prophet
to declare Gods will vnto vs, Psal. 2. 2. Luk. 1. 33. Psal. 110. 4. Esa. 61. 1. Deut. 18. 15. That he might make vs also kings and priests vnto God, and inable vs to instruct others in the will of God, Reu. 1. 6. Rom. 15. 14. Q. How is Christ Gods only Sonne, since all the faithfull are his children? A. God is the Father of Christ by nature, and our Father by grace, Matth. 16. 16. Heb. 1. 5, 6. 2 Cor. 6. 18. Q. Why addest thou, Our LORD? A. He hath created and redeemed vs, he is our best and greatest Master, Psalm. 95. 6, 7. 1 Cor. 8. 5, 6. Rom. 14. 8, 9. 1 Cor. 6. 19. Act. 2. 36. Q. What beleeuest thou concerning Christs con∣ception and birth? A. That he was borne of a mother, without a Father miraculously. Q. Why so? A. That hee might not be conceiued and borne in sinne as we are, Psal. 51. 5. Heb. 4. 15. 1 Pet. 1. 19. Q How diuidest thou the Articles that follow concerning Christ? A. They containe partly his humiliation, and partly his exaltation.
Q. Rehearse those Articles that containe his humiliation. A. He suffered vnder Pontius Pilate, was cru∣cified, dead and buried, he descended into hel. Q. Did Christ, when he liued vpon the earth, liue in pompe, riches, ease and pleasures? A. No: but in pouerty, labour and persecu∣tion, Esay 53. 1, 1. Mat. 8. 20. Heb. 2. 10. Q. What death died he, and how? A. His enemies of malice accused him be∣fore Pontius Pilate the Iudge, who to pleasure them, condemned him to death, euen to the bitter, shamefull, & cursed death of the Crosse, Gal. 3. 13. Phil. 2. 8. Q. Died he willingly or against his will? A. Most willingly, because he knew that God his Father had so decreed, and because his purpose was by his owne death to kill sinne in vs, and saue vs from eternall death, shame and torment, Romans 6. 6. Heb. 2. 14. 15. Heb. 10. 14. Q. What beleeuest thou concerning his buriall and his descending into hell? A. To assure vs of his death, his body was buried, and continued till the third day vnder the dominion of death, that he might deliuer vs from the-dominion thereof, Heb. 2. 14, 15.
Q. Rehearse the Articles that containe Christs exaltation. A. The third day he rose againe from the dead, he ascended into heauen, and sitteth on the right hand of God the Father Almightie, from thence shall he come to iudge the quick and the dead. Q. What beleeuest thou heere? A. That by the power of his Godhead, he raised his dead body to life againe the third day, and that, a glorious life, Ioh. 10. 18. 1 Pet. 3. 18. Matth. 28. 1. Q. Why did he so? A. That hee might shew the same power on vs, by raising our soules now from sin, and our bodies hereafter from the graue, Rom. 1. 4. 1 Cor. 15. 20. Phil. 3. 10. Q. Goe on to his Ascension. A. Forty daies after his Resurrection, he ascended visibly in soule and body into hea∣uen, Acts 1. Q. Why did he so? A. That we whiles we line, may through his quickning spirit, ascend by heauenly affe∣ctions, Col. 3. 1, 2. that at our death, our soules may ascend and be with Christ, Phil. 1. 23. Luke 16. 22. Reuel. 14. 13. Luke 23. 43 and that
at the last day, we may both in soule and body ascend and liue with him for euer, Ioh. 14. 2. 1 Thess. 4. 17. Q. How doth Christ sit at Gods right hand? hath God the Father a right hand and a left, and other parts of a mans body, as many imagine? A. Their imagination is foolish and wic∣ked: for his sitting there doth signifie, that the same Christ that was so greatly humbled, is now exalted aboue all men and Angels, Ephes. 1. 20, 21, 22. Q. What profit haue we thereby? A. This, that he can and doth defend vs from all enemies, maketh intercession for vs, Rom. 8. 31, 34. and sendeth vs the Holy Ghost, Ioh. 16. 7. Acts. 2. 33. and the Ministers of his Word, Matth. 28. 18. 19. 20. Ephe. 4. 10. 11. Q. What beleeuest thou concerning his comming to Iudgement. A. He will come from heauen in glory, with all his holy Angels, and all men shal giue account to him, of all their thoughts, words and deeds, Matthew 25. 31. 1 Cor. 4. 5. 2 Cor. 5. 10. Matth. 12. 36. Acts 17. 31. Eccles. 12. 14. Q. Which is the third part of the Beleefe? A. I beleeue in the Holy Ghost. Q. What is the Holy Ghost?
A. God, the third person in Trinity, Acts 5. 3, 4. proceeding from the Father and the Son Ioh. 15. 26. Gal. 4. 6. who doth direct, sanctifie, and comfort the faithfull, Ioh. 16. 13. Rom. 1. 4. and 8. 9, &c. Gal. 5. 22. Ioh. 14. 16. Q. Of these three Persons, is any one greater then another, or in time before another? A. No: but they are all equall & coeternall. Q. Rehearse the fourth part of the Beleefe. A. I belieue the holy Catholick Church, &c. Q. What is this holy Catholike Church? A. The whole number of those, whom God, before the world began, decreed to sanctifie in this life, and to glorifie in the next life, with Christ their Head, Eph. 1. 4, 5. Eph. 5. 25, 26, 27. Q. What hath God decreed of the rest of man∣kinde? A. To let them runne on in the course of sinne, vnto endlesse damnation, Rom. 9. 13, 22. Q. If God hath of old decreed euery mans sal∣uation or damnation, then a man elected shall be saued, liue he neuer so wickedly, and areprobate shall be damned, liue he neuer so godly? A. It is a foolish and a wicked thing to imagine that any reprobate can liue or die godly, or that God will suffer any of his elect to liue and die wickedly.
Q. How then conceiuest thou of this matter? A. Thus, that God in ordaining the end, or∣daineth fit meanes withall: therefore he de∣creeth, that the elect, by faith and the fruits thereof, shal obtaine saluation; as the reprobate by their infidelity and the fruits thereof, do purchase their owne damnation; Esay 38. 5, 21 Matth. 2. 13. Acts 27. 24, 31. Mark. 16. 16. Q. Proceede to the priuiledges of the Church: what beleeuest thou concerning the Communion of Saints? A. This Church or body of Christ con∣sisteth of many members, all which receiue the same spirituall life from their head, and are helpfull as fellow members one to another, Eph. 4. 4, 5, 6. 1 Cor. 12. 26. Q. What further beleeuest thou? A. That euery Saint hath all his sinnes for∣giuen him by the death of Christ, and shall at the last day rise againe with his owne body, and liue for euer with Christ in heauen in per∣fect happinesse, Matth. 25. 34. Q. If it shal be thus only with Saints, what then shall become of the wicked, which are by farre the greater number? A. They also shall rise againe, euery one of them with his owne body, but to this end, to
be tormented in hell for euer with the deuill and his angels, Matth. 25. 41. Q. Hitherto thou hast shewed how this Creede teacheth vs to beleeue rightly: shew further how thou art taught by the same to liue godly: de∣clare this out of the first part. A. He that truly beleeueth that God is his Almightie Father, will truly loue, feare, obey, and trust in him, Mal. 1. 6. 1 Pet. 1. 14, 17. Matth. 6. 32. 1 Pet. 5. 7. he will re∣semble his Father in righteousnesse and true holinesse, Ephes. 5. 1. Ephes. 4. 24. he will pati∣ently beare all his corrections, Heb. 12. 5. Q. Declare this in the second part. A. He that beleeueth that Christ died for him and rose againe, by the same power and spirit of Christ, working in him, dieth daily vnto sin, and is quickned vnto righteousnesse, Rom. 1. 4. and 6. 3, 4, 5, 6. Phil. 3. 10. Q. Declare this in the third part. A. He that truly beleeueth in the Holy Ghost, findeth himselfe to be anointed and sealed by him, and that he hath receiued him of God as a pledge of his saluation, 2 Cor 1. 21, 22. Ephes. 1. 13, 14. Q. Proceede to the fourth part. A. He that is a member of Christs mysti∣call
body, must and will shew by his conuer∣sation, that Christ liueth in him; he that is a Saint will loue Saints intirely, and helpe them to his power; hee that hath his sinnes forgiuen him, and is washed by the bloud of Christ, will not returne with the dogge to his vomit, and with the sow to wallow in the mire, but will wait earnestly for a glorious Resurrection and Ascension, he will not for the short and imperfect pleasures, riches and honours of this life, lose those perfect and endlesse ioyes, which God hath prepared for him in heauen, Phil. 3. 20, 21. Q. Thou saidst that by this Creede thou art taught to cheere vp thy heart with ioy: declare this in the first part. A. God is my Almighty Father, by this I am more happy than if any earthly king were my father. What riches, what honour, what delight, what other good thing can I want that he seeth expedient for me, Esay 49. 15. Matth. 7. 11. 1 Pet. 5. 7. Luk. 12 32. Rom. 8. 17. his wisedome is my directi∣on, his power is my protection, against the craft and power of all mine enemies. Q. Declare this in the second part. A. Christ died for me, rose againe and
ascended into heauen for mee, and now ma∣keth intercession for mee, my SAVIOVR and none other shall be my Iudge, what need I then feare affliction, or sinne, or hell or death? Rom. 8. 31. to 39. Q. Proceed to the third and fourth part. A. All wicked men and deuils cannot grieue me, so much as the Holy Ghost can and doth comfort mee: I am a member of the Church Christs mysticall body; what sinnes, what sorrows, what enemies bodily or ghost∣ly can rent me asunder from my Head? Q. Goe on to the Communion of Saints and the rest. A. Though I am a sinner, yet am I also a Saint: all Saints on earth pray for me, as I do for them, effectually. All Saints that know my estate, are ready to helpe and comfort mee, as I am to helpe and comfort them; my sinnes are washed away by the bloud of Christ; I shall rise gloriously, I shall ascend with Christ triumphantly, and with him in∣ioy for euer those ioyes which my dull heart cannot now conceiue, nor yet the least part of them. Euen so, come LORD IESVS. Q. Then thou esteemest this faith of thine, to be an inestimable treasure?
A. Yea verily, for without this faith, if I had millions of wealth, I should be most vn∣happy, and in the way to endlesse and intole∣rable shame and torments; but with this faith though pouertie, sicknesse, persecution, and al temporall crosses light vpon me, yet haue I great cause to reioice in God, who is my por∣tion for euer. Q. How is this faith of thine preserued and in∣creased? A. By Prayer, by the Sacraments, and by continuall meditation in the Word of God. Q. Rehearse the Lords Prayer. A. Our Father which art in heauen, &c. Q. Why is it called the Lords Prayer? A. Because Christ, our Lord and Master, taught it vs. Q. What gather we hence? A. Great comfort, in that the Sonne of God himself hath framed and indighted our petiti∣ons for vs, and is euer ready to present vs and our prayers before God his Father. Q. How may it be fitly diuided? A. Into a preface, petitions, & a conclusion. Q. Which is the Preface? A. Our Father which art in Heauen. Q. What learnest thou by this Preface?
A. I learne foure things: First, that wee must pray for others as well as for our selues, Ephes. 6. 18. 1. Tim. 2. 1. Secondly, that God is a louing Father to the godly, and willing to helpe them, Esay 49. 15. Psal. 103. 13. Matth. 7. 11. Thirdly, that God is a heauenly and po∣werfull Father, able to helpe his children, Esa. 51. 12, 13. Psal. 115 3. and therefore we must pray in faith and full assurance to be heard. Fourthly, that we must not pray with pro∣fane, carnall, and earthly hearts, but with re∣uerence to Gods Maiesty, and with heauenly affections, Genes. 28. 16, 17. 1 King. 8. 22. Eccles. 5. 1. Ioh. 11. 41. Q. How many petitions are there in the Lords Prayer? A. Six. Q. What desirest thou in the three first pe∣titions? A. Those things which belong immedi∣ately to God. Q. What desirest thou in the three last pe∣titions? A. Those things that are needfull for our selues, both for body and soule. Q. Which is the first petition?
A. Hallowed be thy Name. Q. What desire we in this petition? A. First, that God may haue praise for all his worthinesse; as for his power, wisdome, iustice, and mercy, Exod. 34. 6, 7. 1 Chron. 29. 10, 11, 12. Reu. 4. 8, 9, 10, 11. Reu. 5. 12, 13. Secondly, that God may haue thankes for all his benefits; as for our health and peace, food and rayment, for our election, creation, redemption, vocation, assurance of glorifica∣tion, and for the comfort of his most holy word, Psal. 103. and 104. Eph. 1. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. 9. Ephes. 5. 20. Q. Which is the second petition? A. Thy Kingdome come. Q. What desire we in this petition? A. First, wee desire that God would con∣uert the wicked, Psal. 51. 13. and 67. 2. Matt. 3. 2. and 4. 17. Secondly, that God would increase his gra∣ces in the godly, Ephes. 1. 17, 18, 19. Ephes. 3. 16 17, 18, 19. Thirdly, that God would aduance his King∣dome, by sending godly Magistrates and Mini∣sters, and specially by Christs comming to iudgement, 1 Tim. 2. 2. Mat. 9. 38. Reu. 23. 20. Q. Which is the third petition?
A. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in hea∣uen. Q. What desire we in this petition? A. We pray that God would enable vs, to walke in the way of all his Commande∣ments: And that Magistrates and people, Mini∣sters and hearers, husbands and wiues, parents and children, masters and seruants, may per∣forme those duties of their seuerall callings, which they owe one to another, Ephes. 4. 1. and 5. 21, 22, &c. Q. What meane these words, In earth as it is in heauen? A. Wee desire grace to doe Gods will gladly and cheerfully, as the Angels in heauen doe the same, Psal. 103. 20, 21. Q. Which is the fourth petition? A. Giue vs this day our daily bread. Q. What desire we in this petition? A. We pray, that God would giue vs food, raiment, health, peace, and all things needfull for this present life. That he would stirre vs vp to labour and diligence, that hee would keepe vs from sloth and idlenesse, and giue a blessing to our honest endeuors. Q. What learnest thou further from the words of this petition?
A. First, that whatsoeuer wee lawfuly pos∣sesse, is Gods gift, Deuteronomie 8. 17, 18. Ha∣bac. 1. 16. Secondly, that we must haue a feeling of other mens wants, as well as of our owne, and shew it by charitable deeds, Heb. 13. 3. Thirdly, that if we haue maintenance only for the time present, and none for the time to come, we must bee content, and depend on Gods prouidence, Matth. 6. 25. Fourthly, that although we liue not in ease, plenty, and pleasure, yet if we haue things ne∣cessary, we must be content, Gen. 28. 20. 1 Tim. 6. 8. Q. Which is the fift petition? A. Forgiue vs our trespasses, as wee forgiue them that trespasse against vs. Q. What desire we in this petition? A. We pray that God would forgiue vs all our sinnes, originall and actuall, of commissi∣on and omission, secret and open, whether knowne or vnknowne euen to our selues, Psal. 51. Psal. 19. 12. And that he would not only pardon our sin∣full deeds, but all our wicked, vnprofitable, and idle words, all our sinfull purposes, and all our desires, ioyes, feares and griefes, that are against
the loue of God and of our neighbour, Ecc. 11. 9. and 12. 14. Matth. 12. 36. And further, that God would giue vs grace, truly to examine our selues, to discerne our sinnes, to confesse them, to hate and forsake them. Q. Why is this added, As we forgiue them that trespasse against vs? A. To teach vs to forgiue all wrongs, to end our quarrels, and to be free from malice, or else God will not forgiue vs, Matth. 5. 23. and 6. 14, 15. and 18. 23. Q. Which is the sixt petition? A. And lead vs not into tentation, but deli∣uer vs from euill. Q. What desire we in this petition? A. We pray that God would not suffer the deuill, nor the world to preuaile against vs, nor our owne corruptions to preuaile within vs, but that he would giue vs strength to ouer∣come them, Eph. 4. 22. and 6. 10, 11. 1 Ioh. 5. 4. That we may be wise to discerne when Satan tempteth vs to those things which seeme to be no sinnes, Matth. 4. 3, 6. or when he vseth our owne friends for his instruments to de∣ceiue vs, Gen. 3. 6. Mat. 16. 22, 23. Q. Which is the conclusion of the Lords praier?
A. For thine is the Kingdome, the power and the glory, for euer and euer, Amen. Q. What is the meaning of this conclusion? A. Because God is our gracious King, and carefull for his subiects, and seeing his power is such, that he can giue vs all good things, and defend vs from all euill, 1 Chr. 29. 10, 11. 2 Chr. 20. 6. Psal. 62. 11. & 115. 1. 1. Tim. 1. 17. Reu. 4. 11 and 5. 12, 13. And seeing the things we haue prayed for, are for his owne glory, therefore we earnestly desire, and stedfastly beleeue that he wil grant them vnto vs. Amen let it be so, yea without doubt it shall be so. Q. How doe the wicked pray this prayer? A. They shew their vile hypocrisie in euery part thereof. Q. How doe they shew their hypocrisie in the preface? A. They call God Father, and yet haue no assurance of his loue, nor care to please him, but shew themselues to be his enemies, and chil∣dren of the deuill, Ioh. 8. 44. 1 Ioh. 3. 8. Q. How doe they shew their hypocrisie in the three first petitions? A. They dishonour God, they despise his iustice, power and prouidence.
They take part with euill men in euill cau∣ses, and so contend and fight for Satan and his kingdome, against Christ and his subiects, Psal. 2. 1, 2, 3. Luk. 19. 14. They reiect Gods will, and doe their own, they follow their owne lusts, they imitate not Angels in heauen, but beasts on earth, or deuils in hel. Q. How doe they shew their hypocrisie in the rest of the petitions? A. Daily bread contents them not, their wealth is euill gotten, or euill spent. They aske pardon of sinne, but haue no purpose nor desire to leaue the same. They forgiue not wrongs receiued, but beare malice against Gods children, which haue not wronged them. They are not wary against temptations, but run on boldly: thus their prayer is contrary to the whole course of their life. Q. Then none but a sincere Christian truly cal∣led and conuerted, can pray this prayer or the like, with vnderstanding, and with an vnfained desire? A. It is euen so, and therefore this prayer being rightly vnderstood, is a perfect tryall of a mans true conuersion, Rom. 8. 15, 16.
Q. Thou saist that thy faith is preserued and increased by the Sacrament: what is a Sacrament? A. Gods seale of his couenant made with the faithfull and their seed, Gen. 17. 7, 8, 9, 10. Rom. 4. 11. Q. In this Couenant, what doth God vndertake on his part? A. To defend the faithfull in all dangers, to giue them all good things expedient for them, to cause all things to worke for their good, and to crowne them with eternal glory, Gen. 15. 1. and 17. 1. Psal. 84. 11. 1 Tim. 4. 8. Rom. 8. 28. Q. What doe the faithfull vndertake for their part? A. Not to follow their owne lusts, nor the worlds allurements, nor euil examples, nor the deuils tentations, but readily to obey all Gods Commandements, Ephes. 4. 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, &c. Tit. 2. 11, 12. 1 Pet. 2. 9. Rom. 12. 1, 2. Luc. 1. 72, 73, 74, 75. Q. How many Sacraments be there? A. Two: Baptisme, and the Lords Sup∣per. Q. What is Baptisme? A. Gods seale, whereby we enter into Couenant with him, by the washing of our soules from sinne through Christs bloud, as
our bodies are washed with water, Rom. 4. 11. Eph. 5. 26. Tit. 3. 5. Col. 2. 12. Q. What is the Lords Supper? A. Gods seale, wherby we renue our Coue∣nant with him, whereby our soules are nouri∣shed and comforted with the body and bloud of Christ, as our bodies are with the Bread and Wine, 1 Cor. 10. 16. and 11. 24, 25. 26. Q. Doe all that come to the Lords Supper re∣ceiue profit thereby? A. No: for all vnworthy receiuers re∣ceiue much hurt thereby, 1 Cor. 11. 17, 27, 29. Q. Who are vnworthy receiuers? A. 1. All that are carnall and vnregene∣rate. 2. The godly themselues, when they come with security, hauing offended God, and neg∣lecting to renue their repentance, 2 Sam. 11. 27. 1 Cor. 11. 30. Q. How must thou prepare thy selfe for the Lords Supper? A. I must examine my selfe, 1. Whether I repent me truly of all my sinnes past. 2. Whether I stedfastly purpose to leade a new life.
3. Whether I haue a liuely faith in Gods mercy through Christ. 4. Whether I remember and meditate on Christs death with thankfulnesse. 5. Whether I be in charitie with all men, freely forgiuing them all wrongs done against me, as God for Christs sake hath freely forgi∣uen me. Q. Thou saist that thy faith is preserued and increased by continuall meditation in the Word of God: shew me then to what end, and in what manner oughtest thou both to reade Gods word, and to heare it preached? A. Not for fashions sake to seeme religious, but with a sincere purpose, earnest desire, con∣stant endeuour, and feruent prayer, that thereby my faith may bee strengthened, my life amen∣ded, and my soule comforted, 1 Cor. 14. 3. 2. Tim. 3. 16. Psal. 19. Psal. 119. And further, I must beware of malice against the Preacher, and of a preiudicate opinion of his person or gifts, of pride and selfewill; I must reade and heare with an humble heart: so that when the Word sheweth me any errour of mine, in iudgement or practice, on the right hand, or on the left, I must bee readie to re∣forme it, 1 Pet. 2. 1, 2. Iames 1. 21, 22. &c.
Q. What if the Preacher deliuer things vn∣sound or vnprofitable? A. I must pray, that I may with wisdome discerne, and with modesty refuse the same; but euer I must beware, that I bee not a rash and proud censurer of any man, specially of Gods messengers, 1 Thess. 5. 21. Matth. 7. 1. Iam. 3. 1. Iam. 1. 19, 20. Q. How oughtest thou to prepare thy selfe for death at all times, & specially in time of sicknes? A. After the same manner as I ought to prepare my selfe to receiue the Lords Supper, so that if I recouer, I must walke the more cir∣cumspectly afterward.
MORNING PRAYER for a Family. A briefe Confession with thanksgiuing. WEE most humbly present our selues, O LORD, before the Throne of thy great Maiesty, in the name of thy beloued Sonne our onely Sauiour, confessing that of our selues we are most vile, polluted with sinnes originall and actuall, sinnes against thee and against our neighbour, sins of omission and commission, secret and open, known and vnknown euen to our selues. O let them not make a separation betwixt thee and vs, seeing thou art reconciled vnto vs, and not onely so, but also thou hast vouchsafed to become our louing Father, hauing redeemed vs by thy Sonnes bloud, and adopted vs by his Spirit, whom thou hast sent into our hearts: thou hast also fed, clothed, and lodged vs, thou hast strengthned and preserued vs euen to this
houre; therefore for all thy mercies so many and so great, we praise and blesse thy holy name. And now, Lord, as thou hast raised our bodies from sleepe, so raise vp our hearts from their naturall dulnesse and earthly disposition: Sanctifie vs more and more in soule and body, that euery day wee may grow in grace, and in the knowledge of Christ, by the workes of the Spirit. O Lord increase our faith, giue vs yet more assurance of that thy Prayer for strength of faith. eternall loue, that therein we may reioyce with ioy vnspeakable and glorious, and obediently wait for the perfor∣mance of all thy promises, both to prouide for vs, and to defend vs in this life, and after to crowne vs with eternall glorie. Let this assu∣rance bee such, that thereby we may bee able to endure al the miseries and trials of this mor∣tall pilgrimage, not only with patience and quietnesse, but also with heauenly comfort. And teach vs, O Lord, to loue thee, and that sincerely, that our Prayer for loue to God. false hearts may not goe a who∣ring after the world, whiles wee foolishly and wickedly admire the riches, and pleasures, and pride of this life, and suffer our selues to be
snared therewith. O let vs know, that the loue of thy glorious Maiestie, and of these vile things, cannot stand together. As wee desire to loue thee sincerely, so to loue thee abundantly, that wee may bee the better assured that wee loue thee, let not our loue bee as a sparke of fire couered with the ashes of our darke and earthly corruptions, but let it be as burning coles, and as a vehement flame. And let it appeare by our hear∣tie loue to our neighbour, speci∣ally Prayer for loue to our neighbour. to those, whose good fruits declare them to be thy faithfull children. Suffer vs not this day, nor heereaf∣ter, to be iniurious to any by deceit or oppres∣sion, by slandering or back-biting those that are absent, by reproching or disgracing those that are present, or by any other wrongs, but let vs be profitable and helpfull to many, to the vttermost of our power. Grant that wee may instruct those that are more ignorant then our selues, let vs relieue, according as thou hast en∣abled vs, those that stand in need of our helpe. O Lord, preserue vs from the damnable error of those that Against coun∣terfet happines place their greatest happiness in worldly wealth and pleasure, open our eyes to
discerne yet more cleerely, that if thou be our riches, then wee shal be rich indeed, if thou be our delight, then shall we perceiue how vile and vaine all carnall delights are: Let vs know how good a thing it is to draw neer vnto thee, by hearing thy voyce in thy most holy Word, and by speaking to thee in our prayers and thanksgiuing; withdraw not thy Spirit from vs, giue vs not ouer vnto Satan and worldly lusts, for then shall we runne headlong into all sinne and misery. This that followeth, is verie needfull in many houses of the Gentrie and richer sort. LOrd, preserue this family from the sinnes of idlenesse, pride, fulnesse of bread, from contempt or neglect of the poore, from foolish and corrupt communication, from chambering and wantonnesse, from excessiue and vnsea∣sonable eating and drinking, from louing of pleasures more than thee, the chiefest Good.
In a meane and laborious Family, prayer to this purpose will be conuenient. WEE beseech thee cheere vs vp, and comfort vs in the middest of our la∣bours and trauels, let vs not admire or enuie the happinesse of those that abound with ease and wealth, but euer let vs remember, that a painefull and godly life is the way to perfect rest and endlesse ioy, that an idle, voluptuous, and vnprofitable life, is the way to bitter and endlesse pain, that thou didst consecrate Christ Iesus the Prince of our saluation, through affli∣ctions, that they are blessed that mourne, for they shall be comforted. In what family soeuer, thus proceed. O Gracious Father, accor∣ding to thy loue and thy Prayer for earthly bles∣sings. mercifull promises in Christ, vouchsafe vnto vs now and hereafter, that measure of wealth, and such health, peace, liberty, and credit, as may bee most expedient for vs in our seuerall callings, and for the better discharge of our dutie to thee and our brethren.
Lord preserue and direct thy Vniuersall Church, giue For the Church Ʋniuersall. thy Gospell free passage, let thy power and wisdome confound the dread∣full might and policies of the enemies of thy truth, remoue all stumbling blocks, and knit together thy seruants, by the vnitie of the Spirit in the bond of peace. Continue thy great mercies on these Churches of England, For the Chur¦ches of Eng∣land, &c. Scotland, and Ireland: grant that as the sinnes of all sorts and de∣grees amongst vs, haue been many and verie grieuous in thy sight; so our earnest repen∣tance, and sincere humiliation before thee may bee such, that thy terrible iudgements may be stayed, before thy wrath breake forth against vs. Protect with thy proui∣dence, direct with thy Spirit, For the Kings Maiesty, &c. and inrich with thy heauenly grace, our Soueraigne King: be mercifull to the Queene, to Prince Charles, to the Prince and Princesse Palatine with their issue: Indue the honourable priuie Councellors with wis∣dome from aboue, giue grace to the Magi∣strates, that they may truly and diligently exe∣cute
iustice and iudgement; to the Bishops and Ministers, that they may by diligent and effectuall preaching, and godly example of life, proceed to build vp thy Church amongst vs; root out idle and idoll shepheards, in∣crease the number of faithfull Pastors. Let thy rich blessings bee powred downe vpon all sorts and degrees, to the prayse of thy Name, through IESVS CHRIST our Lord and Sauiour, in whose Name, for these and all other good things needfull for vs and all thy seruants whosoeuer, wee pray as he hath taught vs. Our Father which art in heauen, &c. Euening Prayer for a Family. O Most gracious God, and mercifull Fa∣ther in Iesus Christ, we humble our selues before thy Maiesty, confessing and be∣wailing the sinnes of our whole life, and spe∣cially of this present day. Pardon, O LORD, our disor∣dered affections, which haue Prayer for the forgiue∣nesse of sins. beene too carnestly bent vpon the profits and pleasures of this present life. Forgiue vs whatsoeuer sinfull
anger thou hast beheld in vs, and our inordi∣nate griefe at worldly crosses, when as we are not duly grieued for our sins, and the sins of this Land, and of this age, and for the afflicti∣ons of our deare brethren. Forgiue our car∣nall ioy, which is so strong when earthly things answere our desires, and so weake and feeble, when we consider those spirituall, in∣finite, and eternall blessings, wherewith thou hast blessed vs in heauenly things in Christ. Passe by, whatsoeuer vncharitable, vnprofi∣table, or vnsauoury talke, hath proceeded from any of vs, with neglect of that admo∣nition, or instruction, or consolation, which we should haue ministred one to another. O pardon, for thy mercy sake, our neglect and omission of workes of piety towards thee, or of mercy towards our neighbour, and all our idlenesse. O forgiue our excesse, and our abuse, of meat, drinke, sleepe, recreations, all our in∣temperance, and disordering of minde or body, in making them vnfit for thy seruice, and for the duties of our seuerall callings. O forgiue those our imperfections and corrupti∣ons, that are mixt with our best actions, and doe defile the same.
And specially forgiue our vn∣thankfulnesse for thy many and A Thankes∣giuing. great mercies; grant that here∣after, we may euer stirre vp our dull hearts, that they may be inflamed with loue to thee, that hast elected vs to saluation, and created vs after thy owne image, that hast redeemed vs, with the inestimable price of thy dearest Sonnes bloud, that hast called vs effectually by thy Word and Spirit, from the power of darknesse vnto the kingdome of thy deare Sonne, not only reconciling vs that were thine enemies, but also making vs thy deare and glorious children, and heires of thy hea∣uenly kingdome. O teach vs to walke worthy Prayer for diuers gra∣ces, and a∣gainst sinne. of this vocation whereto thou hast called vs; instruct vs euer by thy Word, worke on our hearts effectually by thy Spirit, that we may discerne and daily reforme our grieuous corruptions, that we may not flatter nor please our selues in any of our sinnes, nor walke on securely and carelesly, but that wee may striue for, and attaine vnto more power to subdue and conquer our carnall lusts, to resist the allurements of this world, and the
euill examples of the multitude, that we be not any more carried away herewith, as with a violent streame. Open our eyes to discerne the nets which Satan laieth to ensnare vs, in eating, in drinking, in talking, in sporting, in buying, in selling, in giuing or receiuing coun∣sell, in pleasing some, in offending others, that we might displease thy Maiesty, and kin∣dle thy wrath against vs. And whereas there are so many diuersities of opinions in the world, and yet but one truth, O guide and direct vs in the same by thy Spirit of truth; build vs firmely on thy Sonne Christ, that sure foundation. O let vs not depart from any truth, nor bee stiffe in any error which we haue held: Let vs not hate those that dissent from vs in some points, yet building their faith on Christ; grant that wee may follow the truth in loue, and in all things grow vp vnto CHRIST the Head. Make vs deuout and religious to∣wards thee, and obedient to our superiours. Stirre vs vp that we may be helpfull and pro∣fitable to many; Let vs not bee deceitfull, or otherwise injurious to any, in word or deed. Make vs charitable, meeke, and patient, to∣wards all. Let not our faith be dead, like the
faith of Deuils, but a working faith, as the faith of Abraham and of Rahab, that loued dearely thee and thy children, and shewed their faith by their works. Thus let vs walke all our dayes till our change shall come. Let our last daies be our best dayes. Let not the re∣membrance of death be grieuous or terrible vnto vs. Make vs desirous to be dissolued, and to be with Christ. Come Lord IESVS, come quickly, perfit thine owne glorie, and thy seruants happinesse. In the meane time, be∣hold in mercie thy deare Prayer for Gods Church, &c. Spouse whom thou hast re∣deemed with thy precious bloud. Confirme and establish thy seruants, weaken and with∣stand thy foes, confound their malice, their pride and their hellish plots and deuices. Stir vp thy strength and come and helpe vs. O blesse, preserue, direct and prosper our Soue∣raigne King; be mercifull to the Queene, to our hopefull Prince Charles, the Prince and Princesse Palatine with their Issue, the honou∣rable Priuy Counsellors, Nobles and Magi∣strates, the Bishops and Ministers; the Vni∣uersities and Nurseries of learning. Among all sorts, stirre vp those that may
valiantly fight thy battels against the Deuill, & against this world that lieth in wickednes. Be gracious, O Lord, to our Parents, Bre∣thren, sisters, &c.—; to those for whom wee are specially bound to intreate thee, and They that haue such, may here mention them. whom thou hast made thy instruments of good vnto vs. Protect this family, prosper vs in our health, our credit, and in our worldly estate. Aboue all, let vs grow rich in godlinesse, sobriety and righteous∣nesse. Giue vs this night quiet rest, and safe∣tie; raise vs vp againe in due time, that wee may the next day, and so from day to day doe thee acceptable seruice, & glorifie thee in our seuerall callings: For these and for all good things needfull for vs and for al thy children, we pray as thy Sonne our Sauiour hath taught vs. Our Father, &c. A Prayer vpon the Lords Prayer. O Lord our God, thy Sonne our Sauiour hath assured Vpon the Preface. vs that thou art through him a louing Father to the godly, and willing
to helpe them, and that thou art an heauen∣ly and powerfull Father, alwaies able to comfort them, therefore we come vnto thee with boldnesse and confidence through faith in him, and we desire and endeuour to pray vnto thee now and hereafter, not with profane, carnall, and earthly hearts, but with reuerence to thy diuine Maiesty, and with heauenly affections. O helpe vs and streng∣then vs, and raise vp our soules from earth and earthly things, to thee that dwellest on high. First and aboue all things we desire, that praise may be giuen to thee for all thy worthinesse, that thy ene∣mies may know thee to be the Lord, and themselues to be but men; that their power is but weaknesse, and their wisedome but foo∣lishnesse, when they lift vp themselues against thee and thy deare Spouse the Church. Get thee honour vpon thine obstinate enemies, as thou didst vpon Pharao and the Egyptians. But let thy seruants and faithful people know thee to their comfort. Let them sanctifie thee in their hearts, let them euer beleeue and also finde by ioyfull experience, that thy power is their protection, thy wisedome their di∣rection,
thy iustice their deliuerance from all wrongs. And let all prayse and thanks be giuen vn∣to thee for all thy benefits, for our health and peace, for our food and raiment, for thy great fauours so extraordinary bestowed vpon this land for many yeares, and for those which we in particular haue receiued, and do inioy from thy bountifull hand, & specially for those hea∣uenly and spirituall blessings, our election, re∣demption, vocation, assurance of glorification, and for the comfort of thy most holy Word. Let thy Kingdome come; con∣uert the wicked, as many as be∣long to thine election, enlighten the eyes of them that are blinded with the loue of super∣stition: grant that those which wallow in sin, may begin to hate that mire and filth where∣in they haue delighted. O Lord, increase thy gifts and graces in the godly, reigne in them by thy powerfull spirit, thou that art the God of peace, sanctifie them thorowout, that their whole spirit, and soule, and body, may be kept blameless vnto the comming of Iesus Christ. Kill and crucifie in them daily the old man, and let the new man be raised vp in them. O Lord, blesse and prosper the meanes which
thou hast ordained for these euds. Raise vp godly Kings, that may walke in the steps of Dauid, Ezekiah, Iosiah, and religious Nobles, like Ioseph, Obadiah, Daniel, Nehemiah, Mor∣decai, that may administer iustice, and main∣taine truth, and seeke the prosperity of Israel-Increase, we pray thee, the number of faithfull Pastors and teachers, endue them with excel∣lent gifts of Learning and Godlinesse, that they may be able to conuince heresies and er∣rours, to confound euery Iannes and Iambres, that shall resist thy truth. O let thy seruants walke in the steps of the Apostles and Pro∣phets, and not in pride, couetousnesse, or idle∣nesse. Vnite them in thy truth, lest by their diuisions thy people be also diuided; grant that they may be knit together in one minde and in one iudgement, that with one minde, and with one mouth they may prayse thy name. And let vs earnestly wait for thy com∣ming to iudgement, that thou maist put all thine enemies vnder thy feet, and reigne for euer in perfect peace, that wee may reigne with thee triumphantly. In the meane time direct and teach vs to doe thy Holy and blessed will, to renounce and denie our owne
wills that are so foolish, so peruerse and wic∣ked. Teach vs to walke in the way of all thy Commandements; let our hearts be seasoned with godlinesse, let vs loue thee aboue all, let vs feare thee and euer walke in all sinceritie as in thy sight and presence; let vs trust in thee, and rest vpon thy promises for the things of this life and of the life to come. Let it be our chiefe delight to speake to thee by prayer and thanksgiuing and to heare thee speaking vnto vs by thy word both read and preached. Inable vs by thy grace to obey thee in those generall duties that belong to all Christians, and in the particular duties of our seuerall callings; grant that Magistrates and people, Ministers and hearers, husbands and wiues, parents and children, masters and seruants, may conscionably, and in heartie obedience vnto thee, performe those duties which they owe one to another. Grant that in whatsoeuer profession, trade or course of life thou hast placed vs, we may not liue to our selues, but make this our spe∣ciall end, to please and to glorifie thee. And whereas the wicked performe hea∣uenly duties in earthly manner, defiling their praiers, and thy word & Sacraments by their
hypocrisie, grant that we may performe not only heauenly, but also earthly duties and bu∣sinesses in a heauenly manner, walking cheer∣fully in our vocations, endeuouring with all our might to doe thy Maiesty acceptable ser∣uice euery day, and to be through thy grace profitable members of the Church, Com∣mon-wealth, and family where we liue. Di∣rect vs, and inable vs that we on earth may doe thy worke and businesse wisely, and also gladly and cheerfully, with strength and cou∣rage, fearing no aduersary, euer beholding thy face, and following the patterne of thy heauenly Angels. Vouchsafe, O Lord, to giue vs foode, raiment, health, peace; publike and priuate blessings, and all things needfull for this present life. Stirre vs vp to labour and diligence, keepe vs from sloth and idlenesse, giue a blessing to our ende∣uours. Let vs neuer goe about to inrich or maintaine our selues by lying, by deceit or oppression, or any vnlawfull meanes; let vs seeke nothing at the hands of Satan by sinfull practices or purposes, but let our consciences assure vs, that whatsoeuer things we possesse, are thy good gifts. If we haue gotten any
thing wrongfully, giue vs grace to make re∣stitution. Neither pray we against our owne wants only, but also against the wants of o∣ther men, specially of all thy deare children. O let them see and feele thy fatherly affection and prouidence ouer them, and let vs to our power be helpefull vnto them, cutting off all vaine and vicious, all proud and luxuri∣ous expences, that we may haue the more to bestow vpon charitable vses. And though we haue maintenance but for the present time, and none for the time to come, let vs be content and depend on thy prouidence; for thou doest cloath the Lillies, and feede the Birds, but we are of much more value than they, and the haires of our head are numbred: why should we that are thy flocke, feare either want or other miseries, since it is thy pleasure to giue vs a Kingdome? Thou that hast not spared thine owne Sonne, but hast giuen him for vs all vnto the death, how shouldest thou not with him giue vs all good things also? Keepe vs therefore from all pen∣siue and distrustfull cares; let vs remember, that as no man can adde one cubit to his sta∣ture, so no man can adde one mite to that pro∣portion of wealth which thou hast already
determined to bestow vpon euery one. Ther∣fore when wee haue vsed lawfull meanes, and done our due endeuour, let vs quietly commit the successe of all vnto thy proui∣dence, knowing that thou hast appointed who shall be poore, and who rich, that if thou withholdest from vs earthly riches, thou canst make vs rich in faith, which is farre better. Therefore though we liue not in ease, plenty and pleasure, yet if we haue things necessarie, if we haue bread to eat, and clothes to put on, let vs therewith bee content, and the rather, seeing that they which striue and toile to bee rich, doe fall into tentations and snares, and into many foolish and noysome lusts, which drowne men in perdition and destruction. O Lord, we pray thee look with thy eye of pitty and compassion, on those that are afflicted with sicknesse, giue them patience vnder thy correcting hand, restore them to their former health, or else prepare them for a better life. Haue pitty on thy seruants that are afflicted with grieuous persecutions, or with horrible warres, and the terrours and calamities that doe accompanie the same; O stop and stay this cruell effusion of Christian bloud, restore peace and tranquillitie.
Forgiue wee pray thee our sinnes and trespasses, our sinnes originall and actuall, of commission and o∣mission, secret or manifest, our want of loue to thee and our neighbour, our inordinate selfe-loue, our dulnesse and vnaptnesse vnto things heauenly and spirituall, our pronenesse and forwardnesse to sinne and vanity, the fast cleauing of our affections to the things of this life Pardon, O Lord, all our sinfull actions, and all our wicked, vnprofitable and idle words, all our sinfull purposes, all our desires, ioyes, feares, and griefes, that are against the loue of thee and of our neighbour: forgiue all our errours, whether in iudgement or in pra∣ctice, whether on the left hand, or on the right. Giue vs grace truly to examine our selues, to discerne our sinnes, and to confesse them, to hate and to forsake them, yea euen our dearest sins, which seeme as a right hand, or a right eye vnto vs, let vs not spare to chop them off, or to plucke them out, and cast them from vs. And that our owne malice against our neighbours, may not hinder thy mercie towards vs, and our exacting of small debts, cause thee to require of vs those ten thousand talents which wee owe thee, therefore here in
thy sight wee freely forgiue all wrongs and trespasses, we emptie our hearts of the poyson of malice: if therefore we, whose goodnes is but a drop, doe thus behaue our selues to∣wards them that haue wronged vs, much more thou that art a sea of goodnesse and mercie, canst and wilt pardon vs; and here∣of let vs bee from thee most comfortably as∣sured. Leade vs not into tentation: let vs not bee puffed vp with worldly prosperity, nor bee snared with the baits of sensuality, to loue this world and the things therein: let not our belly be our God, let vs not haue our portion in this life. Nei∣ther let vs bee dismayd with any aduersitie, let no tribulations turne vs out of the right way: let nothing weaken that constant ioy and true happinesse which wee haue in thee alone. Suffer not Satan to circumuent vs, let vs not be ignorant of his enterprises, make vs wise to discern when he tempteth vs to those things which seeme to be no sinnes, or when hee vseth our owne deare friends, as Eue a∣gainst Adam, for his instruments to deceiue vs; Lord, thou knowest his wiles and his depth; thou, O Sauiour, that hast thy selfe
encountred with this dreadful enemy, know∣est that if thou forsakest vs, and withdrawest thy selfe from vs, wee shall neuer bee able to stand against him, and against all the powers of darkenesse. Therefore make vs strong in thee, and in the power of thy might; bestow vpon vs the whole armour of God, and teach vs to put it on vs and to vse it, that in the e∣uill day we may be able both to resist and to conquer. Make vs wary & watchfull against our owne false hearts, lest they betray vs into the hands of Satan: let vs fight mightily euery day against our manifold corruptions; let vs be faithfull vnto the death, that wee may re∣ceiue the crowne of life. Heare, O Lord, incline thine eares The Con∣clusion. to these requests of vs thy humble subiects, for thou art our gracious King, most carefull for vs, thou wilt not suffer vs to become a prey vnto thine enemies. Thy power is such, that thou canst giue vs all good things, and defend vs from all euill, and thou knowest that the things which we haue prayed for, are for thine owne glorie. There∣fore wee earnestly desire, and stedfastly be∣leeue, that thou wilt grant them vnto vs. A∣men, let it be so. Yea, without doubt it shall
bee so as we haue prayed: wee beleene, Lord helpe our vnbeleefe. Vnto thee, O Father, Sonne, and Holy Ghost, be all honour and glory, now and for euer. Amen. A short Morning Prayer. O Lord our God, most gracious and mer∣cifull Father in Iesus Christ, as thou hast bestowed vpon vs innumerable and inestima∣ble benefits, so vouchsafe, we beseech thee, to adde this grace and mercy to the rest, that thou stirre vs vp and inable vs by thy holy Spirit, to praise and magnifie thy name both for our rest and safetie this night past, and for all the rest of thy mercies. Lord open our eyes, and inlarge our hearts to praise thee for the forgiuenesse of our sinnes, so many and so hainous, by the bloud of thy Sonne, a price so infinite and precious; for our Redemption from the thraldome of Satan, and from those infinite and endlesse torments which with him we should haue suffered, and that by thy Word and thy holy Spirit thou hast exalted vs to be thy royall children, and heires of thy Kingdome. O giue vs grace this day and euery day to walke worthy of this vocation;
renue and quicken our Repentance, humble our hearts with the sight of our sinnes, con∣firme our faith in thy promises temporall and spirituall; teach vs to loue thee feruently, to despise riches, pleasures, pride, and all earth∣ly vanities. Teach vs obedience to our supe∣riours, and loue to all men, euen to our ene∣mies, much more to all thy deare children. Preserue vs and euerie one of vs this day and euery Heere let those sinnes be named which are most practised in the family. day from swearing, cursing, lying, from reproaching and slaundering, from deceit and oppression, and all other of∣fences against thy Maiesty, or against our Neighbour, from idlenesse, gluttony, drun∣kennesse, intemperance; from chambering and wantonnesse, from strife and enuie, from all sinfull words or deeds, from all vnlawfull attempts or purposes. O pardon all our sins past, assure our soules of this forgiuenesse; giue vs grace to hate all manner of sinnes in others, and specially in our selues, to be watchfull ouer our waies, to be constant in all good purposes. O Lord, blesse and defend thy vniuersall Church, our Soueraigne King, the Queene,
and all the Royall progeny, the Nobles and Magistrates, the Bishops and Ministers. O be fauorable and gracious to al that are neere and deare to vs, direct and prosper euery one of vs in all our intended labours and businesses. For these and all good things needfull for vs, and for all thy children, we pray as our deare Saui∣our hath taught vs; Our Father which art in heauen, &c. A short Euening Prayer. MOst gracious God, and mercifull Fa∣ther, we present our selues before thy glorious Maiesty, in the name and media∣tion of Iesus Christ, most humbly beseeching thee for his sake, to forgiue all the sinnes of this day, our worldly affections, our inordi∣nate and carking cares and griefes, our greedy desire after earthly things, our ouer-valuing of these earthly vanities, and our neglect of heauenly things: O pardon all our vaine, vnprofitable, and vnsauoury talke, all omis∣sion of good duties, to thee or to our neigh∣bour, all our corruptions and defects, in those which we haue taken in hand. Forgiue all the sinfull acts of this day, and
of our whole life: Grant that wee may search out our sinnes diligently, and discouer them, and stedfastly resolue to reforme them without delay, and enable vs by thy Spirit to performe what wee intend, that we may be constant in all good purposes and enterprises. Grant that euery day wee may crucifie the old man, that our naturall pride, malice, enuie, strife, may die in vs; that couetous∣nesse, infidelity, trust in riches, or howso∣euer in the arme of flesh; that wanton lusts and desires may be mortified in vs, that idle∣nesse and voluptuous liuing may be hatefull to vs. Grant that wee may practise the con∣trary vertues, that humility before thee and before men, that charity in forgiuing wrongs in word or deed, and in helping and relee∣uing the wants of our neighbours, may abound in vs, that faith and loue, that tempe∣rance and sobriety, may shine bright in vs, that we may be iust and faithfull in our con∣tracts and dealings with all men. Quicken vs euer to all religious duties, to praier and thanksgiuing, let vs aboue all things delight in the constant reading, hearing, and medita∣tion of thy Word, assure vs of the pardon of our sinnes, of thy loue and fauour, and of our euerlasting saluation.
Let vs euery day thinke on death, on the resurrection, and the last Iudgement, and that not with horror and griefe, but with great ioy and comfort: Let vs vnfainedly desire, and euery day prepare our selues to be with Christ. Make vs heartily thankefull for all thy mer∣cies, for publike and priuate benefits, so many and so great, for our food and ray∣ment, our peace and safety, and specially for our election, redemption, and effectuall vocation. Blesse, O LORD, thy vniuersall Church, comfort thy seruants that are pinched with want, those that are afflicted with warre, persecutions, or with inward tentations, or whatsoeuer tribulations. Preserue and direct our soueraigne King, blesse the Queene, and all the Royall Issue, the Nobles and Magistrates, the Bishops and Mi∣nisters, and the rest of thy people. Blesse and preserue this family, giue vs quiet rest and sleepe, raise vs vp in due time, to doe thee seruice in our seuerall places. For these and all good things, we pray as thy Sonne our Sauiour hath taught vs, Our Father which art in heauen, &c.
A Prayer for a young Scholler, or any of the younger sort, both Morning and Euening. MOst gracious God and louing Father, I giue thee most humble and hearty thankes for all thy mercies; for choosing me to saluation, and redeeming me with the precious bloud of Christ my Sauiour, for calling mee to this great honour, to be one of the number of thy children, by working in my heart true faith, and hatred of all sinne, by thy holy Word both read and preached, and by thy blessed Spirit. And I praise thy holy Name for my health, for my food and raiment, for good nurture, and godly educa∣tion, for my preseruation this night day past, and at all times. O Lord continue thy fauour towards me, teach me to know thee, to loue and feare thee, to keepe all thy Commandements. Let not the corruption of my nature, nor the craft of Satan, nor euill company, nor any worldly vanity, withdraw me from thee. Suffer me not to slide from thee into any false
beleefe, or an vngodly life, but instruct mee in all truth and godlinesse, in all sobriety and righteousnesse. O Lord, forgiue me all my sinnes, teach me to discerne them, to hate and forsake them: grant that I may bestow vpon thee all the daies of my youth, and so continue thy faithfull seruant to my liues end. O Lord preserue thy Church, our Soue∣raigne King, the Queene, and all the Royall Issue, the Magistrates, and Ministers of thy Word, and all thy people. Blesse my deare Pa∣rents, brethren, sisters, & other friends; blesse this whole family; giue me health, defend me from idlenesse, learning, businesse, defend mee in prosper my soule and bo∣die, this night day and euermore. Amen. Our Father which art in heauen, &c,

Lord be mercifull to my parents: grant I may honor them according to thy Commandement, that by my weldoing I may be a comfort vnto them: defend them and me, and al this family, and al the rest of thy people in soule and body this day and euer. Amen. FINIS.
