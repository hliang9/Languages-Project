WHereas Our Deer, and Beasts of Forrest and Chase, as well Male as Female, have been heretofore frequently killed upon Warrants at unseasonable times in the yeer, by Our Forresters, Keepers, and others in Our Forrests, Chases, and Parks, within this Our King∣dome of England, to the great destruction of Our Game. To the end therefore that all Our Forresters, Rangers, Keepers, & other Our officers attending Our Game of Deer, within and Our Forrests, Chases or Parks may know, and duely observe the true seasons and times in the yeer for killing of Deer, both Male and Female, as they are herein by Vs prescribed and appointed. Our will and pleasure is, and Wee do by these presents straitly charge and command them and every of them from henceforth to forbear the hunting or killing upon Warrants, of any of Our Harts, Stagges, Bucks, or other Male-Deer, Red of Fallow in any Our Forrests, Chases or Parks, or else∣where within this Our Kingdome of England, or Dominion of Wales, in any yeer hereafter, be∣fore the seventh day of Iuly (being about the end of the Fence-moneth) or after Holy-Rood day: And likewise that they from henceforth yeerly forbear to hunt or kill upon Warrants, any Hinde, Doe, or other Our Female Deer before Holy-Rood day, or after the Feast of Epipha∣ny, commonly called Twelfth day: And of this Our Royall will and pleasure Wee do hereby require, and strictly enjoyn all Our Forresters, Keepers, and other Our Officers aforesaid, and all other Our loving Subjects whom the same doth or may concerne, to take know∣ledge, and obediently to observe Our directions herein, as they will avoid Our displeasure and indignation, and will answer the contrary at their uttermost perils. Given at Our Court at VVhitehall,  the seventeenth day of January, in the thirteenth yeer of Our Reigne. God save the King. ¶ Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most Excellent Majestie: And by the Assignes of John Bill. 1637.
