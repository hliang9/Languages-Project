All which simples with their vses are easily knowen, being plainely described in this booke, and are gotten without any great cost or labour, the most of them being such as growe in most pla∣ces, and are common amongst vs. But for thy better direction, thou shalt vnderstand (good Reader) that all the simples (except Oke, which being omitted in the right place, is set in the ende of the booke) are set downe in order of the Alphabet, so that
thou mayest without any difficultie finde them by the titles of the pages: and to e∣uery simple is annexed a briefe Table of the effects thereof. There are moreouer two generall Tables: the one at the beginning of the booke, conteining all the simples in order, with numbers directing to the seue∣rall places where they are to bee found: the other at the ende setting downe the names of the diseases and other operations, hauing those simples which afford any remedy for the same, ad∣ded vnto them in order so plainely, as thou canst not erre therein.

The Garden of Health, conteyning a description of all sortes of Simples, with their seuerall vertues and properties. Abracock. (See Peach idem.) ¶ Acatia, ACatia stoppeth the Laske, and the termes, and setteth the loose matrix in the naturall place being drunke with red wine. 2 It is good to be laid to serpigo or wilde fire, all inflama∣tions and hot tumours, wheales, and hote blisters of the mouth, and with eye medicines to heale inflamations, blastings and swellings of the eyes being applied. 3 It maketh the haire blacke being often washed with the water wherein it hath beene soked: The leaues and tender crops of Acatia doe settle and strengthen members that are out of ioynt, if they be bathed in a hot bath, or stewe made with the broth thereof. 4 Being ground with vineger, it abateth the pusshes of the lepry. (See Sloes.) 5 In plasters it helpeth swel∣lings, and humours in the eyes wonderfully, drinke it for the flixe, seethe it in the water of decoction of Pomegranates, or in vineger, and drink it to kill wormes. 6 Vse it in a pessary to stop the flowers, to stop fluxes, vse subfumigatiōs thereof, or els drink it. Seede distilling vse Acatia. 7 It helpeth the holy fire, apo∣stumes and woundes of the eyes, it stoppeth the termes, it healeth creeping sores, the falling of the matrix, it stayeth vomiting, and strengtheneth the stomake, and ceaseth paine. (See Sloes.) Ach 7 Blisters 2 Blasting 2 Eyes apostume 7 swolne 2. 4. 7 Flixe 1. 5. 6 Flowers to stop 1. 6. 7 Haire to be blacke 3 Holy fire 7
Inflamations 2 Ioynts out 3 Lepry 4 Matrix loose 1 Mouth blisters 2 Pusshes 2. 4 Reines running 6 Seede distilling 6 Stomacke weake 7 Swellings 1 Tetters 1 Vomiting 7 Wheales 1 Wildfire 1 Wormes 5 Acorus, or Gladen. DRinke halfe a spoonefull of the pouder of the Roote with white wine, and vse it as much in thy pottage to heale the elfe cake and hardnesse of the side. 2 Stamp the roote and streine it with some Rew and Mints in Ale, and make possets therewith, and drinke the ale of them to expell vrine. 3 The broth of the roote procureth vrine, is good for the paines of the side, liuer and brest, the gnawing of the guts, drawings together or burstings, and for womens griefes as Iris is, it wasteth away the milte, and helpeth the strangurie, & the bitings of serpents. 4 Drinke a scruple of the roote against all inward bruises with foure oun∣ces of honied wine. The roote is much vsed among preserua∣tiues and Treacles. 5 The broth is good against the swellings of the stones, and all hardnesse and gathering of humours be∣ing sodden in wine and laide to. 6 The iuice driueth away the darknesse of the eyes. 7 The roote punned with a little Verdi∣greice, a little of the roote of great Centorie and a little hony, draweth foorth all kindes of thornes, splints, and broken bones. 8 The roote mixt with vineger and applied, doeth consume and waste colde tumours and swellings. 9 The iuice rubbed on the place, driueth away and killeth the stinking wormes, and mothes called Cimici. 10 Halfe a dram of the seede taken with vineger wasteth and cureth the hardnesse of the milce. 11 For the griefes of the liuer and milte, bruise one pound of Acorus, and steepe it three dayes in vineger, then seethe it to the one halfe, then streine it, and put hony to it, and seethe it againe till the vineger be con∣sumed, and take of this Oximel dayly in the morning with the de∣coction of Acorus. 12 If any beare Acorus about them, they shall not haue the bloody flixe, nor the crampe. 13 Seethe Aco∣rus in water & vse for the plurisie, the griefes of the chest or brest, and of the liuer or milte, the strangurie and painefull making of
water. 14 Stampe the roote and seethe it in water to the third part, and drinke thereof three dayes, it doeth wonderfully bring forth the vrine, and healeth the strangurie. Note that the same roote or herbe is not to be vsed in Agues. Calamus Aromaticus, or the roote of Asarabacca may supply the want of it. (See in their places.) 15 For the stitch in the side drinke pouder of it with a draught of Malmesie. 16 Toothache apply a piece of the roote to the tooth that aketh. 17 For venom or poyson drunke, stampe Gladen that groweth on hie grounde and Dragons, and drinke it with wine. 18 To dry vp wounds and to heale them vp with cleane flesh, although the bone be bare, apply powder of the roote with hony. 19 For the dropsie in the belly & feete, and to kill wormes, stampe a good quantity of the root and streine it in white wine and drinke it. 20 Fluxe to stop, seethe bramble berries in water of the decoction thereof and vse it, but if thou haue an ache, bathe in the decoction of it, or wipe thee ouer with cloth weeted therein. 21 Iaundies, bath in the decoction of Gladen and Ciclamen, or stampe them and drinke them with water and couer thee to sweate. 22 Flowers to cause, make a pessary of the roote, and anoynt it with oyle de Bay or common oyle, and cast thereon powder of Wallwort, and put it in all night till it prouoke it to bleede. 23 Prickes and bones to drawe out, stampe the roote and apply it. 24 Drinke it to heale bruisings. 25 Boyle it in water or ale, and streine it with hony, and boyle it againe, and scum it, and drinke it warme in the mornings two houres before meate to purge watrish humours, and for the dropsie. 26 The conserue thereof made with the pappe of the rootes, two or three times so much hony or rather sugar, comforteth the stomacke, and nourisheth and looseth tough flegme downewardes marueilously, and is good for the sickenesse of the braine, and sinewes, and all diseases comming of flegme, and openeth the naturall course and the termes. 27 Stampe the roote of Gladen, and drinke it with stale Ale, and the iuice of Fumiterie morning and euen fifteene dayes, and vse this ointment therewith, stampe snayles, and Red dock rootes, and boyle them with Barrowes greace, and put thereto brimstone and Mercurie ana, and anoynt any skab there∣with, and bee whole though it be of seuen yeeres continuance.
28 To bring downe the flowers seethe Gladen rootes in strong vineger or wine and receiue vp the fume thereof into the matrix closely, &c. it neuer faileth, and therefore beware that you be not with childe. 29 Face euill coloured distill the rootes of Aco∣rus, and of Turnips in a limbeck, and drinke thereof fiue ounces before meate fifteene dayes. 30 Stingings of serpents, apply powder of the vpper partes with wine. 31 To dissolue impo∣stumes vnder the eare, boyle the rootes and stampe them with salt, and apply them. 32 Belly bound, drinke the iuice with the yolke of an egge hote as may bee suffered. 33 Milt griefes, drinke it with wine, sight to cleare put in the iuice.

ADders tongue, stampe it with Swines grease, and apply it to all swellings, inflamations, ringwormes, and shingles, and to heale all woundes and cuts with speede. 2 It is singular good to heale wounds both inward and outward, and for all bur∣stings
and ruptures being sodden in wine and drunke. 3 Seeth it in water, and drinke it against all hot feuers, inflamations of the liuer, and all inward and outward heates. 3 Stampe it with swines grease, and vse it to all burning and spreading sores, hote swellings and impostumes, and the holy fire. 4 Apply it to a wound either greene or drie to heale it speedely, drinke the decoc∣tion of it to heale al inward wounds and al other griefes. Apply it to the newe ruptures of children, and binde it hard with a trusse. 5 Seeth it with Sallet oyle while it is greene, and so it helpeth both swellings and sores, wounds, &c. 6 Being wrapt in Vir∣gins waxe, and put into the left eare of a horse, it causeth him to fall as if he were dead, but being taken out, he riseth againe.

(See Larch tree.) ¶ Agnus castus. AGnus castus is a singular good remedy for all such as would liue chaste: for it withstandeth all filthie desire to lechery, it drieth vp the seede of generation, whether it be taken in powder or decoction, or that the leaues be strawed in the bed to sleepe vp∣on, and therefore is called chaste, cleane, or pure. 2 The seede drunke dissolueth all windinesse in the stomacke, intralles, bowels, and matrix, and all other partes of the body, and openeth and cu∣reth all hardnesse and stopping of the liuer and milte, and is good in the beginnings of dropsies, one ounce being drunke with wine. 3 Taken by itselfe, or with Peneroiall, it prouoketh termes, and so it doeth, put in as a pessarie. 4 Some mixe it with oyles and ointments that are made to heate, mollifie, and heale the hard and stiffe members that are waxen dead, sleepie, benommed or wea∣ried, it cureth also the clifts and chops of the fundiment and great gut being laide to with water. 5 Agnus castus driueth all vene∣mous
beastes from where it is scattered or burned. 6 It healeth all venemous bitings being applied, or the seede thereof drunke. 7 It helpeth hardnesse, stoppings, apostumations, and vlcers of the matrix, if women sit in the decoction or broth thereof. 8 The leaues with butter doe dissolue the swellings of the coddes being applied. 9 A branch or rod thereof caried in the hand, defendeth the bearer from chafing and wearinesse. 10 The seede drunke increaseth milke. 11 With vineger and oyle, it is good for the frensie and letargie. 12 The leaues sodden in wine and honie, heale the vlcers and sores of the mouth and gummes. 13 For satyriasis or standing of the yarde, eate the seedes thereof, or seethe it in wine, and plaster it to the reines and secret partes. 14 Agnus castus sodden in vineger with Fenell, is good against the dropsie. 15 Sodden in salt water with Sage and Smallage, and the hinder part of the head washed therewith, helpeth the le∣targie. 16 Being either drunke or caried about one, it taketh a∣way luste. 17 A plaister thereof applied, helpeth the head ache that commeth of euill humors. (See Tutsan.) Beasts venemous to driue away. 5 Bitings venemous 6 Chastitie to cause 1 Cods swollen 8 Dropsie 14 Frensie 11 Fundament chapt 4 Head ache 17 Letargie 11. 15. Liuer stopt 2 Lust to abate 16 Matrix sores 7 Members benommed 4 Milke to increase 10 Milte stopte 2 Mouth sores 12 Stomake windie 2 Termes to prouoke 3 Wearines to preserue frō 9 Yard standing 13 ¶ Alecost, Costmary, or Maudlinwort.

is hard for the bellie. 25 The blacke, that is ripe, is disposed to corruption, and is euill for the stomacke, eyes, and head. 26 If it be dried, it stoppeth fretting or wasting sores, and scattereth car∣bunckles: it is good to wash the gummes that haue filthy moy∣sture, with the oyle of wilde Oliues, it fasteneth loose teeth being applyed with wooll or fine cloth, till they be white, and it will helpe them. 28 No man can describe all the vertues of the oyle Oliue. 29 Oliues eaten before meate, loosen the belly, and strengthen the stomacke, cleanse the liuer, &c. 30 Being eaten with vineger, they loosen the bellie. 31 Oyle Oliue taken with as much Renish wine or white wine, or powred in by Glister, helpeth much the Chollicke, Iliake, and paine of the stone. 32 It may bee eaten with white bread in sops in stead of Butter, and so it looseneth the belly more then Butter. 33 Drinke foure spoones full with as much Sacke or white wine warme, to prouoke an easie vomite, and to cleanse the stomake. 34 Breath short or difficultie, dippe a sponge in hote oyle and apply it. 35 Chollike, seeth rawe yarne in ashes and oyle and apply it to the Nauell and Reines. 36 Burning, boyle Hony and oyle togther, and anoynt therewith: or boyle the inner barke of El∣dren with oyle or newe greace with some Masticke and Frankin∣cence, and waxe, and anoynt. 37 Eares deafe, boyle Cummin in oyle Oliue and streine it, and drop it in. 38 Earmes wormes, boyle quicke Lime in it and streine it, and put it in. 39 Eyes web, put in a very small drop of oyle by it selfe.

QVince: The Quince stoppeth the laske or common fluxe, the bloody-fluxe, and all other fluxes of blood, spitting blood, especially when it is rawe: for when it is either boyled or rosted, it stoppeth not so much, but it is then fitter to be eaten, and more pleasant to the taste. 2 Women with childe that eate Quinces often in meate or otherwise, shall bring foorth wise chil∣dren of good vnderstanding. 3 The Codenac, or Marmalad made with hony as it was wont to be, with sugar as they vse to make it now a dayes, is very good to strengthen the stomacke, and to keepe the meate therein till it be perfectly digested. 4 Being taken before meate, it stoppeth the laske, and after meate it looseth the belly, and closeth vp the mouth of the stomacke so fast, that no vapours can ascend vp into the braine, and cureth headache, that
commeth of such vapours. 5 The decoction or broth of Quinces hath ye like vertue, & stoppeth the belly, & al fluxes of blood, and the violent issues of the termes. 6 With ye same it is good to bathe the loose fundament & falling downe of ye matrix, to make them to re∣turne into their naturall places. 7 They are also good in plasters to stop the fluxe & vomiting, & for al hote swellings & inflammati∣ons of the breast & other places. 8 The downe that groweth vpon Quinces sodden in wine & applied, healeth carbuncles. 9 The oile of Quinces staieth vomitings, gripings in ye belly or stomack with ye casting vp of blood, if ye stomack be anointed therewith. 10 The flowers of the Quince tree doe stop fluxes, spitting blood and the flowers, & haue the same vertues that Quinces themselues haue. 11 If the stomacke be very hote and moist, or the belly laxatiue, Quinces are best to be eaten before meate, being rosted or eaten colde, & the tarter that they be, ye better they are. 12 And Pome∣granates be of the same vertue. 13 But the custome of taking of Quinces in meates hurteth ye sinowes, but by way of medicin they be excellent. 14 And the cores taken out and preserued in hony or kept in their mussilage, they may long continue to ye vse of rosting or baking: for they be perilous to the stomacke being eaten rawe, but preserued, they doe mightely preuaile against drunkennesse. 15 If he that hath drunke well eate a Quince rosted or other∣wayes ordered, the drinke shall not annoye his braine much. 16 Quinces well rosted or baked, are of good nourishment, and are good for the stomacke, and take away belching, vomiting, and lothing, especially taken after meate. 17 The syrupes and Elec∣tuaries made of Quinces with spices, are very profitable for many griefes. 18 The iuice of a rawe Quince is very good for them whose winde is stopt, and cannot holde their meate. 19 Quinces preserued whole in hony, are very good to be vsed of them that haue the bloody fluxe. 20 Rawe Quinces applied in plasters are good to stop the fluxe and vomiting, the heate of the stomacke, and inflammation of the breast and liuer. 21 The decoction of the leaues is good against the falling downe of the matrix and funda∣ment. 22 The seede steeped in Rose-water, is good against thicke and grosse humors, in burnings with fire. 23 Gawles and Med∣lers be of the same vertue. 24 No man can sufficiently declare the vertues of Quinces. 25 Quinces are good for the stomacke,
they make a man pisse well, but when they are rosted, they are counted to be gentler. 26 The iuice of rawe Quinces is good for them that are short winded. 27 The broth of them is good to bathe the mother in that falleth downe. The Quinces that are condited with hony prouoke vrine. 28 They that are sodden in hony, are more pleasant for the stomacke. 29 They are good raw in plasters to stop the belly, for the inflammation of the stomacke and paps, for vomiting, hardnesse of the milt, and swelling about the fundament. 30 You may make wine of them, by stamping and streyning them, but it will not last, except you put to euery xv. quartes one quart of hony, for without hony it will turne to vergis. 31 The wine so made is good for all the things aforesaid. 32 The oyle of Quinces is made of the smallest, roundest, and best smelling Quinces. 33 The flowres both greene and drie, are good in emplasters for all things that neede binding, and for inflammations, & vomiting of blood. 34 And they are also good against the flixe, and to stop the termes. 35 Head-ache, eate ro∣sted Quinces after meales when the ache commeth of vapours. 36 Vomit to stop, steepe the kernels in water and drinke it, or binde the leaues vnto thy wristes. They may be gathered in Au∣gust, and kept all the yeere. 37 Fluxe, seethe Quinces after they be pared and cored with Oke apples & Cinamom, and sugar it and take thereof iii. nights. 38 To make Marmalad of Quin∣ces, take Quinces xvi. pound, core them, seethe them, and stampe them in a stone morter, then clarifie tenne pound of hony with the gleyre of an Eg, or white well beaten, and seeth all till it be stiffe, then lay it on a marble stone, and cut it of what fashion you will. 39 A plaster of Quinces is restrictiue and good for the bloody flixe. 40 Tong sharpe and drie, put the seedes of Quinces, and Psilium, or one of them into a cloth, & steepe it in water, and wash therewith. 41 Stamp Barley meale with halfe as much Quince kernels with vineger, and apply it to burnings or inflammations of the goute. 42 Mixe the pap of sodden Quinces eight ounces, with powder of Sugar foure ounces, vineger sixe spoonefull or more, Ginger halfe an ounce, white Pepper one dramme, seethe it to the height of a Conserue, and take thereof before and after meate to comfort the stomacke.

RAdish eaten at supper doeth well digest meate, heateth the stomacke, causeth a stin∣king breath, if any sleepe by and by after the eating of it. 2 The roote is hurtfull to wo∣men with childe. 3 Canker in olde vlcers, anoint with the iuice of the roote, or vse the powder of it. 4 Boyle the iuice with hony, and mixe it with a little vineger, and streine it and drinke it, to helpe the quarten Feuer and the stopping of the milt. 5 Stampe the roote and apply it to the water betweene the skinne and flesh, and to the hardnesse of the milt. 6 Kings euill, drinke the iuice of the roote with the lyanor of Reasins. 7 And with hony to void the cough, stopping the breast, and shortnesse of breath. 8 Bruise the rootes, and steepe them two or three dayes in vineger, then put thereto a third part of hony, and streine it and drinke of this Oximell to helpe the feuer quotidian and quarten, except the same come of salt flegme. 9 For colde and vndigested humors in the stomacke, steepe the rindes of the rootes in vineger and hony mixt together, and eate dayly a good quantity thereof, & drinke after it a
