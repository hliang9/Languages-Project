The .xxvij. daie of December A Proclamacion, concernyng their reue∣rent talkes of the Sacrament. WHere as the Kynges highnesse hath of late, with the assent and con∣sent, of the lordes Spiri∣tuall and Temporal, and the commons in the Parliament helde the daie of in the first yere of his moste gracious reigne, made a
good and Godly Acte and Estatute, a∣gainst those, who doth contempne, de∣spise, or with vnsemely and vngodly woordes, depraue and reuile the holy Sacrament of the body and bloud of our lorde (commonly called the Sacra∣mēt of thaltar.) And thesame estatute hath moste prudently declared, by all the wordes and termes, whiche, scrip∣ture speaketh of it, what is vndoub∣tedly to bee accepted, beleued, taken and spoken, by, and of thesaied Sacra∣ment: Yet this not withstandyng, his maiestie is aduertised, that some of his Subiectes, not contented, with suche wordes and termes, as scripture doth declare thereof, nor with that doctrine which the holy ghost, by the Euange∣listes and Sainct Paule, hath taught vs: do not cease to moue, contencious and superfluous questions, of thesaied holy Sacrament & supper of the lorde, enteryng rashly into the discussyng, of the high mistery thereof, and go about in their sermons or talkes, arrogantly to define the maner, nature, fashion,
waies, possibilitie or impossibilitie, of those matters whiche neither make to edification, nor God hath not by his holy worde opened. Whiche persones not contented reuerently and with o∣bediēt faithe, taccept that thesaid Sa∣crament, accordyng to the saiyng of. S Paule, the bread is the communion or partakyng of the body of the lorde, the Wine likewise, the partakyng of the bloud of Christ, by the wordes institu∣ted and taught of Christ, and that the body and bloud of Iesu Christ is ther whiche, is our comforte, thankes ge∣uyng, loue token of Christes loue to∣wardes vs, and of oures as his mem∣bers within our self, searcheth and striueth vnreuerētly, whether the bo∣dy and bloud, aforesaied, is there real∣ly, or figuratly, locally, or circūscript∣ly, and hauyng quantitie and greate∣nes, or but substancially, and by sub∣stan̄ce onely, or els but in a figure and maner of speakyng: whether his bles∣sed body be there, hedde, legges, armes toes and nailes, or any other waies,
shape & maner, naked or clothed, whe∣ther he is broken & chewed, or he is al∣waies whole, whether the bread there remaineth, as we see, or how it depar∣teth, whether the flesh be ther alone & the bloud, or part, or ech in other or in thone both, in thother but only bloud & what bloud, yt only whiche did flow out of the side, or that which remained with other such irreuerēt superfluous and curious questiōs, (whiche, how & what, & by what meanes, and in what forme) maie bryng into theim, which of humain & corrupt curiositie, hath desire to searche out, suche misteries as lieth hid in the infinite & botomles deapth of the wisedom & glory of god, and to the whiche, our humain imbecillitie cānot attain, & therefore, ofte tymes turneth thesame to their awne & others destruc¦cion, by cōtencion & arrogant rashnes, whiche simple and Christian affeccion reuerently receiuyng and obediently beleuing, without further searche, ta∣keth and vseth to moste great comfort and profite. For reformacion whereof,
and to the intent that further conten∣cion, tumulte and question, might not rise emonges the Kynges Subiectes: The Kynges highnes, by the aduise of the Lorde Protector, and other his maiesties counsaill, straightly willeth and commaundeth, that no maner per∣sone from hencefurthe, do in any wise contenciously & openly argue, dispute, reason, preache or teache, affirmyng a∣ny more termes, of thesaid blessed Sa∣crament, then bee expressely taught in the holy Scripture, and mencioned in the forsaied act, nor deny none, whiche bee therein conteined and mencioned, vntill suche tyme as the kynges maie∣stie, by the aduise of his highnes coun∣saill, and the Clergie of this realme, shall define, declare and set furthe, an open doctrine thereof, and what ter∣mes and wordes, maie iustly be spoken therby, other then be expressely in the scripture, conteined in the Acte before rehersed. In the meane while, the kin∣ges highnes pleasure is, by the aduise aforesaied, that euery his louyng sub∣iectes,
shall deuoutly and reuerently, affirme and take that holy bread, to be Christes body, and that Cuppe, to bee the cuppe of his holy bloud, accordyng to the purport and effect of tholy scri∣pture, conteined in thact before expres∣sed, and accomodate theimself, rather to take thesame Sacrament worthely then rashely to entre into the discus∣syng of the high misterie thereof. Yet the kynges highnes mindeth not here∣by, to let or stoppe the ignoraunt, and willyng to learne quietly, reuerently and priuately, to demaunde of those, whom he thynketh knoweth more, the further instruccion and teachyng, in thesaid blessed Sacrament, so that the same be not doen with contencion, nor in open audience, with a company ga∣thered together about them, nor with tumulte: Nor dooeth prohibite any manne hereby, likewise so quietly, de∣uoutly and reuerently, to teache or in∣structe the weake and vnlearned, ac∣cordyng to the more Talent and lear∣nyng, geuen to hym of God. But one∣ly
that all contenciō, strief and tumult and irreuerentnes might be auoyded, and in open audience or preachyng, no∣thyng taught, but whiche maie haue the holy scripture for warraunt, vpon pein that whosoeuer shall opēly, with contencion or tumult, and in a compa∣ny gathered together, either in Chur∣ches, Alehouses, Markettes, or elles where, contrary to the fourme and ef∣fect of this Proclamacion, defende and maintein, or irreuerently and conten∣ciously demaunde of any manne, any of the questions before rehersed, either on the one part, or of the other, or any suche like, or do otherwise reuile, con∣tempne, or dispise thesaid Sacramēt, by callyng it Idoll, or other suche vile name, shall incurre the Kynges high indignacion, and suffre imprisonment, or to be otherwise greuously punished at his Maiesties will and pleasure. Geuyng further in aucthoritee, to all Iustices of Peace within the Shi∣res, where thei dwell, to apprehende and take all suche as cōtenciously and
tumultuously, with companies or rou∣tes, assembled about them, do dispute, argue or reason, or stifely maintein, or openly preache and define, the questiōs before rehersed, or any of them, or such like, either on the one part or thother, and to commit thesame to prison, vntil suche tyme, as the Kynges maiesties pleasure herein bee knowen, and that thei immediatly doo certifie the name or names, of the partie so offendyng, and of theim who were there, at the∣same tyme present, makyng the route or assēble, to the kinges highnes coun∣saill: Willyng and commaundyng the∣said Iustices, with al diligence to exe∣cute the premisses, accordyng to the purport, effect and true meaning of the same, and their moste bound duties, as thei tender his highnes will and plea∣sure, and will answere to the contrary vpon their perill. The .xvi. daie of Ianuarij. A Proclamacion for the absteinyng from fleshe in the Lent tyme.
THE Kynges highnes, by the aduise of his moste en∣tierly beloued vncle, Ed∣ward duke of Somerset, Gouernor of his persone, and protector of all his realmes, domi∣nions and Subiectes, and other of his priuie Counsaill, consideryng that his highnes, hath not onely cure & charge, of the defence of his Realmes & domi∣nions, as a king, but also as a christian kyng, and supreme hed of the Churche of Englande & Irelande, a desire, will, and charge to leade & instruct his peo∣ple, to him committed of God, in suche rightes, waies and customes, as might bee acceptable to God, and to the fur∣ther increase of good liuyng & vertue: and that his Subiectes, now hauyng a more perfect and clere light of the Go∣spell and true woorde of the lorde, tho∣rowe the infinite clemencie and mercie of almightie God, by the handes of his maiestie, and his moste noble father, of famous memorie, promulgate, shewed declared, and opened vnto thē, should
and ought thereby, in all good workes and vertues increase, be more forward diligent and plentifull: As in fastyng, praier and almose deedes, in loue, cha∣ritee, obedience, and other suche good workes, commaunded to vs of God, in his holy scripture: Yet his highnes is aduertised and informed, that diuerse of his Subiectes, bee not onely to all these more slowe and negligēt, but ra∣ther contēpners and dispisers of suche good and godly actes and deedes, to the whiche, if thei wer of their awne myn∣des bendid & inclined, thei neded not by outward and princely power, bee ap∣poyncted and commaunded. But for so muche as at this time now alate, more then at any other tyme, a greate parte of his subiectes, do breake & contempne that abstinence, whiche of long tyme hath been vsed, in this his Maiesties realme, vpon the Fridaies and Sater∣daies, and the tyme commonly called Lent, and other accustomed times, his highnes is constreined, to see a conue∣nient order herein, set and appoincted:
Not myndyng thereby, that his Sub∣iectes should thynke any difference, to bee in the daies or meates, or that the one should be to God more holy, more pure, or more cleane, then the other, for all daies and all meates, be of one and equall puritie, cleannes and holines, that we should in theim, and by them, liue to the glory of God, and at all ty∣mes, and for all meates, geue thankes vnto hym, of the whiche, none can de∣file vs at any tyme, or make vs vnclene beyng christian men, to whom, al thin∣ges bee holy and pure, so that thei bee not vsed, in disobedience and vice: but his maiestie hath allowed, and appro∣ued the daies and tymes, before accu∣stomed, to be continued and stil obser∣ued here in this churche of Englande, bothe that men should on those daies abstein and forbeare their pleasures, and the meates, wherein thei haue more delight, to the intent to subdue their bodies, vnto the soule and spirit, vnto the whiche, to exhorte and moue men, is the office of a good and Godly
hedde and ruler, and also for worldly and ciuill pollicie, certain daies in the yere, to spare Fleshe and vse Fishe, for the benefit of the common wealth, and profite of this his Maiesties realme, whereof many be Fishers, and men v∣syng that trade of liuyng, vnto the whiche, this realme on euery part, en∣uironed with the Seas, and so plenti∣full of freshe waters, dooth easely mi∣nister occasion, to the great sustenaūce of this his highnes people, so that here by, bothe the nourishment of the lande might bee increased, by sauyng fleshe, and specially at the spryng tyme, when Lent dooth commonly fall, and when the moste common and plenteous bre∣dyng of Fleshe is: And also, diuerse of his louing subiectes, haue good liuyn∣ges, and get greate riches thereby, in vtteryng and sellyng suche meates, as the sea and freshe water doth minister vnto vs, and this his maiesties realme hath more plentie of Shippes, Boates Crayers, and other vessels, by reason of those, whiche by hope of lucre, dooe
folowe that trade of liuyng. Wherfore his Maiestie hauyng consideracion, that where men of their awne mindes, do not geue theimselfes, so oft as thei should doo to fastyng, a common absti∣nence may and should be, by the prince enioyned and cōmaunded, and hauyng an iye and mynd, to the profite and cō∣moditee, of his realme and subiectes, and to a common and Ciuill pollicie, hath willed and commaunded, and by these presentes dooeth will and com∣maunde, by thaduise aforesaid, all ma∣ner of persone and persones, of what estate, degree, or condiciō he or thei be, other then suche as alredy be, or here∣after shalbe excused by lawe, or licen∣sed, or aucthorised sufficiently to the contrary, to obserue and kepe from hencefurthe, suche fastyng daies, and the tyme commonly called Lent, in ab∣steinyng from all maner of Fleshe, as heretofore in this Realme, hath been moste commonly vsed and accustomed, vpon pein that whosoeuer shall, vpon any daie, heretofore wont to bee fasted
frō fleshe, and not by the kynges high∣nes, or his predecessors, abrogate and taken awaie, eate Fleshe contrary to this Proclamacion, shall incurre the kynges high indignacion, and shal suf∣fre imprisonment, and bee otherwise greuously punished, at his Maiesties wil and pleasure. And further the kin∣ges highnes, by the aduise aforesaied, straightly chargeth and commaundeth al Maiors, Bailiefes, and other hedde officers, and rulers of citees and tou∣nes, and all Iustices of Peace, in the Shires where thei be in Commission, to be attendant and diligent, to there∣cucion of this proclamacion, in cōmit∣tyng to prison the offendors, contrary to this Proclamacion, vpon sufficient proffe thereof, by twoo sufficient wit∣nesses, before them had and made, there to remain, duryng the kinges pleasure accordyng to the true purport, effect, & meanyng of thesame, as thei tender the kynges maiesties wil & pleasure, & wil answere to the contrary at their peril. And where the late kyng, of moste
famous memory, father to his highnes hath geuen diuerse yeres, licēce to his subiectes, in the tyme of Lent, to eate butter, Chese, Egges, and other mea∣tes, commonly called White meates, the kynges highnes, by thaduise afore¦said, cōsideryng thesame to haue been doen, not without great consideraciōs doth geue likewise licence and auctho∣ritee, to all his louyng subiectes from hencefurthe, frely for euer in the tyme of Lent, or other prohibited tymes, by lawe or custome, to eate butter, egges Chese, and other White meates: Any Lawe, statute, acte, or custome, to the contrary notwithstandyng.

THe kynges highnes, by the aduise of his mooste entierly belo∣ued vncle, the duke of Somerset▪ Gouernor of his moste Royall

bothe to confusion and disorder, and also to the high displeasure of al∣mightie God, who loueth nothyng so muche as order and obedience: where∣fore, his Maiestie straightly chargeth and commaundeth, that no maner per∣sone, of what estate, order▪ or degree so euer he be, of his priuate mynd, will or phantasie, dooe omitte, leaue doune, chaunge, alter, or innouate any order, rite or ceremonie, commonly vsed and frequēted, in the churche of Englande and not commaunded to be left doune at any tyme, in the reigne of our late souereigne lorde, his highnes father, o∣ther then suche as his highnes, by the aduise aforesaid, by his maiesties visi∣tors, Iniunccions, Statutes, or Pro∣clamacions, hath already, or hereafter shall commaunde, to bee omitted, left, innouated, or chaunged: But that thei bee obserued after that sort, as before thei were accustomed, or els now sithe prescribed, by the aucthoritee of his maiestie, and by the meanes aforesaid, vpon pein that whosoeuer shall offend

And where as other vnlearned and eiuill disposed persones, haue not stic∣ked to instil and whisper, into mennes cares, and to perswade abrode, eiuill and perillous opinions, against Gods law, and the good order of the realme: some teachyng, that a manne maie for∣sake his wife, and mary another, his first wife yet liuyng, and likewise, that the wife maie doo to the husbande. O∣ther, that a man maie haue two wifes, or mo at once, and that these thynges, be prohibited, not by Godes lawe, but by the Bishop of Romes lawe: so that by suche eiuill and phantasticall opi∣nions, some haue not been afraied in deede, to mary and kepe twoo wifes. The whiche opinions, the kynges ma∣iestie, as a moste Christian Prince, by the aduise aforesaied, not allowyng as godly, or cōuenient to be spred abrode,

The .xxiij. daie of September. A Proclamacion, for the inhi∣bicion of al Preachers. WHeras of late, by rea∣son of certain contro∣uersious and sedicious preachers, the kynges maiestie, moued of tē∣der zeale & loue, which he hath to the quiete of his subiectes, by thaduise of the lorde protector, and other his highnes counsaill, hath by
proclamacion, inhibited and commaū∣ded, that no maner of persone, excepte suche as was licenced by his highnes, the lorde Protector, or by the Archbi∣shop of Cantorbury, should take vpon hym to preache, in any open audience, vpon pein in thesaied Proclamacion conteined, and that vpon hope and es∣peraunce, that those beyng chosen and elect men, should preache and setfurth onely to the people, suche thynges as should bee to Gods honor, and the be∣nefite of the kynges Maiesties subie∣ctes. Yet neuerthelesse, his highnes is aduertised, that certain of thesaied Preachers so licenced, not regardyng suche good admonicions, as hath been by thesaied lorde protector, and the rest of the counsaill on his maiesties behalf by Letters, or otherwise geuen vnto them, hath abused thesaied aucthoritie of preachyng, and behaued themself ir∣reuerently, and without good order in thesaid preachynges, contrary to suche good instruccions and aduertisemen∣tes, as was geuen vnto them, whereby
muche contencion and disorder might rise and insue, in this his Maiesties realme: wherefore his highnes, myn∣dyng to see very shortly, one vniforme order throughout this his realme, and to put an ende of all controuersies in Religion, so farre as God shall geue grace (For whiche cause at this tyme, certain bishoppes and notable learned men, by his highnes commaundement are congregate) hath by thaduise afor∣saied thought good, although certain and many of thesaied preachers so be∣fore licenced, haue behaued theimself very discretly and wisely, and to the honor of God and his highnes conten∣tacion, yet at this present and vntill suche tyme, that thesaied order shalbe set furthe generally, throughout this his Maiesties realme, to inhibite, and by these presentz dooth inhibite, gene∣rally, aswell thesaied preachers so be∣fore licenced, as all maner of persones whosoeuer thei bee, to preache in open audience in the pulpit or otherwise, by any sought colour or fraude, to the di∣sobeiyng
of this commaundement, to thintent that the whole clergie in this meane space, might apply theimself to praier to almightie God, for the better acheuyng of thesame moste Godly in∣tent and purpose, not doubtyng but that also his louyng Subiectes, in the meane tyme will occupie theimself to Goddes honor, with due praier in the Churche, and pacient hearyng of the Godly Homelies, heretofore setfurth by his highnes Iniunccions vnto thē, and so endeuor themself, that thei maie be the more ready with thankfull obe∣dience, to receiue a moste quiet, godly, and vniforme order, to be had through∣out all his saied realmes & dominions. And therefore, hath willed all his lo∣uyng officers and ministers, aswell iu∣stices of peace, as Maiors, Sheriefes, Bailifes, Constables, or any other his officers, of what estate, degree, or con∣dicion soeuer thei be, to be attendaunt vpon this proclamacion and commaū∣demēt, and to se the infringers or brea∣kers thereof to be unprisoned, and his
highnes, or the lorde protectors grace, or his Maiesties counsaill, to be certi∣fied thereof immediatly, as thei tender his Maiesties pleasure, and will aun∣swere to the contrary at their perill. The last daie o October. A Proclamacion, for the paiment of the late incumbentes of Colleges THe Kynges moste ex∣cellent maiestie, by the aduise of his most dere vncle Edward Duke of Somerset, Gouer∣nor of his moste royal persone, and Protector of all his real∣mes, dominions and Subiectes, myn∣dyng to prouide for the late Incumbē∣tes of Colleges, Chauntries, Stipen∣daries, Fraternities, Guildes, & suche other within this shire of con∣uenient and reasonable recompences and pencions, accordyng to the statute in the first yere of his highnes reigne in that behalfe ordeined: hath cōmaun∣ded and appoyncted, seuerall Letters patentes to be made, vnder the greate seale of the court of thaugmentacions
and reuenues of his maiesties croune, for the pencions of thesaied late Incū∣bētes, which patentes his maiestie, by thaduise aforesaid, doth all his faithful subiectes to vnderstande, are presently sent to the handes of his highnes audi∣tor, receiuor and surueior of this coun∣tie, with streight commaundement vn∣to them, to deliuer thesame Patentes immediatly, and to make paiment vnto the parties whom thei concerne, now, and hereafter yerely franke and free, without fee, duetie, or some of money to bee demaunded, or taken of thesaied pencioners, either to his maiesties vse or to the vse of any Officer, Minister, Clerke or other persone. Wherefore, his maiestie willeth all those persons, whiche haue to doo herein, to resort to his highnes Audite, now presently to bee holden within thesaied Countie, or els where thesame officers shal∣bee, and there thei shall re∣ceiue their Pencions accordyngly. .§. .§.
Anno. III. The last daie of Ianuarij. A Proclamacion for the pro∣longacion of Testons. WHere as the Kynges moste excellent maie∣stie, with the aduise and assent of his derest vncle, Edward duke of Somerset, Gouer∣nor of his royall persone, Protector of his highnes realmes, dominions, and Subiectes, and the rest of his graces counsaill, hath heretofore by Procla∣maciō, beryng date the .x. daie of Aprill in the second yere of his reigne, geuen notice and commaundement, to all ma∣ner his louyng subiectes and others, hauntyng his maiesties realmes or do∣minions, that from the last daie of the Moneth of December last passed for∣wardes, the peces of .xij.d. commonly called Testons, should no lenger bee curraunt, nor passe in paiment or re∣ceipt as his graces coyne, but be taken onely for bullion: whereunto his ma∣iestie was moued vpon suche conside∣racions,
as in thesaied former procla∣macion, was more at large expressed. Forasmuche as it hath sithens come to his highnes knowlege, that by reason of the greate nomber of thesame Te∣stōs, whiche at this present are disper∣sed abrode, in so many mennes handes, beside no lesse cautele and pollicie, vsed euen hard vpō the daie by diuerse, ma∣kyng whole paimētes in thesaid coyne and specially for that, those that haue plentie of other money, take vnreaso∣nable allowance of the poorer sorte, whiche is moste to be relieued, for the exchaunge of those testons, muche de∣triment and inconuenience should en∣sue, to the possessors of thesame, onles a remedy by prolongyng of the terme then appoyncted for their callyng in were prouided: his maiestie therefore, by the aduise aforesaid, is moste graci∣ously pleased, willeth and commaun∣deth, that the terme of the callyng of thesaied peces of .xij.d. commonly cal∣led Testons, shalbe yet further prolō∣ged and extended, to the first daie of
Maie nexte commyng, after the date hereof. And that duryng all the meane space, thesaied Testons (beyng of his highnes standerd) shalbe currant tho∣rowe out his highnes realmes and do∣minions, after no lesse value and sort, then if thesaied former proclamacion, for their callyng in had not been made. Prouided alwaies, that after the∣saied first daie of Maie, thesaied Te∣stons shall no lenger bee currant, but bee vsed in suche sorte, as that former proclamaciō doth specifie, this present prolongacion notwithstandyng. And further, his maiestie exhorteth all his said louyng subiectes, that like as his highnes for their benefite, was moued to reuoke thesaid Testons, and for their more commoditie is pleased, to prolong the daie of their callyng in: so thei also in the meane while, will haue the better regard and hede, that suche Testons as thei take, bee of his maiesties stāderd and coyne, seyng the nomber to be suche of false and forrein testons, as are now so dispersed abrode
to the deceipt and losse of the takers: and that duryng this tyme of respite, thei indeuour themselfes from daie to daie, by porcions and smaller somes, to bryng in suche testons as thei shall haue, into any his maiesties mintes, as shall best serue for their purpose, there to receiue the iust exchaunge of the∣same: so as by lyngeryng or deferryng of the bryngyng in of suche Testons, vntill thesaied first daie of Maie, li∣mitted by this peremptory admoniciō, their negligence be not cause that whē the mintes (if the whole masse come in at once) are pestered, their exchaunge shall not be so ready vnto theim as o∣therwise it should. Moreouer, because his Maiestie moste graciously aboue other thynges tenderyng the relief of the poorer sort of his louyng subiectes, doth consider, that their nede or vnhabilitee, to for∣beare by a space (bee it neuer so small) the exchaunge of their Testons at his graces Mintes, might be an occasion that others of the richer sorte, with
whom thei should perchaunce bee dri∣uen to bargain for other money, in lieu of their Testons, should then exacte or take of theim vnresonably, for the ex∣chaunge (as it hath comen to his high∣nes knowlege, that some all redy haue not been ashamed to demaunde, & take against all cōscience and equitie.) His highnes therefore, by the foresaied ad∣uise, dooth straightly charge and com∣maunde, that no maner of persone or persones, whatsoeuer thei be, do take by any meanes, for the gain of the ex∣chaunge of any Testōs, aboue .ij.d. for euery pound in Testons (whiche is .xx s.) and after that rate, for smaller so∣mes in Testons, vpō pain of losse and forfaicture of so muche money, or the value thereof, as he or thei for any higher rate of gain, in euery pounde or smaller somes, shall haue deliuered in exchaunge for testons to any persone, the one moytie therof to be applied to his highnes, and the other to the par∣tie complainyng. And finally, his maiesties pleasure
is, that betwene this and the first daie of Maie aforesaied, no maner persone, bee so hardy to refuse in paimentes greate or small, any suche Testons of his graces standard, but shall accepte theim no lesse then other his highnes coyne for the tyme, vpon pein aforsaid. In whiche behalf, his maiestie like∣wise chargeth all maner Maiors, shi∣riefes, Baylifes, Iustices of Peace, and others his graces officers and mi∣nisters of Iustice, that thei, or suche of theim as by informacion of the partie cōplainyng, shall haue due knowlege hereof, faile not to se the whole effecte of this penaltie executed, vpō the par∣tie complained on (if he be giltie) as o∣therwise thei themselfes shalbe Sub∣iect to the like daunger, vpon further informacion against them geuen. Prouided also, that suche person or persones, as al redy haue collected to∣gether, at other mennes handes, any Testons for a gain, that is to saie, af∣ter a lesse rate and value, then thei were currant, shall not by occasion of
any thyng or clause herein contained, otherwise vtter, dispise, or put in vre, any suche Testōs so by them collected but shall onely bryng theim into the Mintes without faylyng, as euery suche offendors, beyng vpon like infor∣macion founde culpable, shall incurre the like penaltie in eche behalfe, as is before expressed. The .xix. daie of Februarij. A Proclamacion concernyng Pira∣tes and robbers of the Sea. THe multitude of Pi∣racies and Robberies on the Seas, beyng of late greatly increased to the Kynges Maie∣sties high displeasure, and no small slaunder of this his high∣nes realme, by reason that suche per∣sones, who had the chief care & charge thereof, and should moste especially haue seen thesame redressed and amen∣ded, hath rather been concealors or mainteiners of suche Piracies, as of late (by the grace of God) it hath been reuealed and doth appere: his maiestie
therefore, by the aduise of the Lorde Protector, and the rest of his highnes counsaill, moste earnestly myndyng to procede with all care and force, against thesaied Pirates and Sea Robbers: and to cause his Lawes more seuerely to be executed, lest perauenture any of his louyng Subiectes, should either ignorauntly fall into daungier, or wil∣lyngly pretende ignoraunce of his La∣wes, dooth by this his maiesties Pro∣clamacion, straightly charge and com∣maunde, that no maner of persone or persones, do by any colour or pretence from hencefurthe, receiue, aide, succor, releue, defende, conceale, or abbet any maner of Pirat or Pirates, whatsoe∣uer thei bee, either on the seas, or in a∣ny Porte, Hauen, Creke, or any other toune of the kynges maiesties, or in a∣ny other place, within his Maiesties realmes and dominions, by sea or land vpō pain that whosoeuer shall offende, contrary to this Proclamacion, shal∣be taken for a Pirate or fautor of thē, and suffre suche paines of death, losse
of goodes, and forfaictures, as the Pi∣rates theimselfes or their fautors, by the Lawes of this Realme, should or ought to do. And whatsoeuer persone or persones, shall buye of any Pirate, or by any other fraude or couyn, shall wittyngly take any maner of gooddes or marchaundises, Piratically taken, or conceale thesame: the persone so of∣fendyng, to bee taken for a receiuor of Pirates, and so iudged, and suffre ac∣cordyng to the Lawes of this realme. And whosoeuer hereafter shall buy or take by exchaunge, or any other colour any gooddes of any Pirate, or whiche were Piratically taken: The kynges highnes, by the aduise aforesaied, fur∣ther willeth that the person so takyng suche gooddes, as aforesaied, shall not onely be compelled to deliuer thesaied gooddes and Marchaundises, to the true owners of thesaid gooddes, with∣out any recompence therefore, if thei require thesame, but also bee further punished by imprisonmēt or otherwise at his highnes pleasure. And for the
better repressyng of the like robberies and Piracies hereafter, his Maiestie willeth and requireth, all and euery his maiesties louyng subiectes, to en∣deuour theimselfes, to the best of their powers, to apprehende and take the∣saied Pirates, by all waies and mea∣nes thei maie, whereby, thei shall not onely shew themselfes good subiectes to his Maiestie, but also be well assu∣red to be further rewarded, and consi∣dered of his Maiestie, in suche sort, as thei shall haue good cause to bee well contented: wherfore, his highnes wil∣leth and commaundeth, all Iustices of Peace, all Maiors, Shiriefes, Cone∣stables, Hedborowes, portereues, and al his officers and ministers, to se this proclamacion executed and performed accordyng to the true meanyng there∣of, without any parcialitie or fauor, as thei tender the kynges maiesties plea∣sure, and will auoyde the contrary at their vttermoste perilles.

The .vi. daie of Aprill. A Proclamacion for the reforma∣cion of light horsemenne. WHere as it is come to the knowlege, of the Kynges most excellēt maiestie, that e∣mōges other disorders of late tyme, crept into the aunciēt discipline of warre, heretofore obserued mooste straightly, by the Subiectes of this realme, as the chiefest cause of so many victories, whiche, by meanes thereof haue risen to thesame: there is a nota∣ble
and perillous sorte, of deceipt and breche of that discipline, vsed aswel by capitaines, as souldiors enterteined in his highnes wages, and specially such capitaines of lighthorsemen, and those of their bandes, beyng of the Counties of Northumberlande, Cumberlande, Westmerlande and other places of the borders, as for defence of thesame, are enterteined still in wages, to his Ma∣iesties no small charge, and expence of threasure: whiche capitaines, hauyng not so muche before their iyes, their duetie toward their soueraigne Lorde and Coūtrey, nor yet their awne sure∣ties, as a vile mynde, and filthy respect to their awne gain, by deceiuyng of his highnes, and pollyng of the souldiors, without shame or drede, dooe not onely diminishe their nombers, appoyncted to serue vnder theim (sauyng that for a coloure at the Muster daie, thei haue some others to supply the voyde pla∣ces) but also by pattishment with vn∣mete and vnseruisable men, for a lesse wages then his highnes alloweth, do
in suche sorte disguise their nombers (contrary to his highnes expectacion, and trust reposed in theim) as in a ma∣ner the thirde parte of the nombers, whiche his maiestie appoyncteth & pa∣yeth for, is not redy, able, or sufficiētly furnished to do that seruice, whiche is looked for to the greate deceipt of his maiestie, and no lesse daunger of suche other his highnes true Subiectes and souldiors, as vpon confidence of thaide of suche light horsemen, to ioyne with them at any encoūtre with the enemy, finde themselfes deceiued and abando∣ned. Accordyng to the which said most naughtie and shamefull behauiour of suche capitaines, the souldiors in like sorte, that are of their bandes, takyng thereat example and boldnes, doo nei∣ther prouide themselfes of horse or har∣nes, mete to serue withall, nor yet be∣yng commaunded to set furthe, towar∣des any place of seruice, do repaire the∣ther togethers, but somtime more then the halfe part remaineth behinde, or if thei go, sticke not to returne home by
small companies without leaue, with seuerall praies & booties, more sought of thē then seruice. And that is wourst of all, at any approche or affronture of the enemie, without order, or respecte of abidyng by the standerd, doo vse co∣monly vpō euery litle moment, or cau∣seles, to beginne the flight, betraiyng their felowes, whiche, through suche their fliyng lose often tymes, that as∣sured aduauntage of victorie, whiche with their tariyng, thei might bothe haue been partakers of. And moreouer if so be thei tary, thei do it not so much for discharge of their profession of ser∣uice, as onely for desire of spoyle and pillage, whiche pillage thei seke not so muche vpon the enemies, as rather v∣pon his highnes awne subiectes or frē∣des, namely the assured Scottishmen, whose gooddes and cattals, diuerse of those light horsemen of Northumber∣lande, and others of the borders, haue of late moste rauenously spoyled and robbed, as by sundery complaintes of suche assured menne, it hath been tou∣ched:
his maiestie therefore, myndyng the reformacion hereof, by thaduise of his derest vncle and con̄sailor, the duke of Somerset, gouernor of his persone, and protector of his maiesties realmes dominiōs and subiectes, and the rest of his highnes priuie coūsaill, hath deter∣mined, & straightly chargeth and com∣maundeth, all and singuler the capitai∣nes of any bandes, or nombers of light horsemen, & specially capitaines of any bādes, or nomber of light horsemen be∣yng of the countie of Northūberlande, or any other Countie or place, vpon a∣ny the borders aempst Scotland, that thei accordyng to the nombers theim appoyncted, and wages for thesame al∣lowed, faile not from hencefurthe to entertain, and haue in continuall are∣dines, thesaied whole and entier nom∣ber, without diminishmēt in any part of thesaied nomber, or defalcacion of a∣ny parte of the wages, so allowed by his highnes, to euery suche light horse man of their bande. And further, that thesaied Capitaines faile not, to haue
their saied complet bandes alwaies, in suche a redines, from tyme to tyme to serue, as vpon one houres warnyng, to be geuen them by his highnes com∣missaries, wardens, or other chief of∣ficers there for the tyme beeyng, thei maie bee founde ready to set furthe, to what place thei shalbee appoyncted. And moreouer, that none of thesaied Capitaines, or any light horsemen of their bandes, be so hardy at any roade, or other inuasion of the enemies groūd or defence of the borders, to depart frō the standard, or otherwise forsake or skatter from the rest of the armie or company, either with their whole bā∣des, or smaller partes for spoyle, or o∣ther cause: Nor yet be so hardy to for∣sake or depart frō any Fortresse, to the garde whereof thei shalbe appoyncted, vnles thei shall haue expresse cōmaun∣dement, or licēce of the chieftain of the enterprise, or capitain of ye fort so to do And finally, that thesaid capitaines and light horsemen of their bandes, forbeare and refrain from hencefurth,
to commit any spoyles, or other pilla∣ges vpon any of the assured Scottish∣men, their goodes, landes or cattalles, whiche haue been receiued into his maiesties proteccion, onlesse the com∣missaries or chieftain for the tyme be∣yng, vpon the not keping of promise by those assured men, do geue theim com∣maundement so to do. And that in likewise, thei forbeare from the enbaiselyng or pilferyng, ei∣ther of Horses, Geldynges, Harneis, Weapons, or any other thyng pertay∣nyng to any other souldiour, seruyng his maiestie in the warres on that side, whereby the seruice of the partie so robbed, by any of thesaied light horse∣men, should be hindred and he end am∣maged. Also, that no capitain of light horsemen, or souldiour of his bande, be so hardy as to sell, geue, exchaunge, or otherwise by any fraude, cautele, or train, directly, or indirecty procure or finde the meanes, to set out of purpose any horse, mare or geldyng to be taken or come into the possessiō of any Scot∣tishman,
or other straunger beyng his maiesties enemie, vpon pain that what soeuer capitain or capitaines, souldior or souldiors of their bandes, aforsaied, whiche shall in any part neglect, diso∣beye, or breake any poynct of this his maiesties commaundement and order of reformacion in these seuerall cases, afore rehersed, or els disobey or breake the orders of reformacion set furthe by the last Parliament, in the Articles where pain of death is expressed, shall from hencefurth, vpon due profe of the offence, incurre the daungier and losse of his or their lifes by execucion, at the direccion of his maiesties Lieutenant, Warden, Commissaries, or other ge∣nerall Capitain or gouernor, there by his highnes for the tyme placed. And semblably, if any souldiour or souldiours, beyng placed in garrisons within any his Maiesties peces, vpon the borders, or within Scotlande, be∣yng by the Capitain of thesaied peces assigned, to any charge of watche or warde, for the suretie of thesaied pece,

And in case any assured Scottishman, shall help to cōueigh by any meanes of pur∣pose any Horse, Mare or Gelding vn∣to the enemie: his maiestie willeth and is pleased, that vpon due proffe there∣of, the partie offendyng herein, shall lose the benefite of his assuraunce, and frō thencefurth be vsed, as if no suche assuraunce had been made vnto hym: straightly chargyng & commaundyng, all and singuler his Maiesties Com∣missaries, Wardens, and other gene∣ralles vpon the borders, for the tyme beyng, and by whatsoeuer name of of∣fice, it shal please his highnes to name theim, that thei not onely se the whole effect of this reformacion, to be put in

In the whiche space yet many abusyng his highnes clemen∣cy, hath kept their testons still in their hādes, or otherwise vttered them, and fewer sithens that tyme, till nowe of late haue been brought into his high∣nes Mintes. The whiche Testons, if thei should nowe remain onely mere bullion, should be great losse and hin∣deraunce to his Maiesties subiectes: and if thesame staie or Proclamacion, should in any wise be released, it shuld be greatest losse and hynderaūce to the realme, and a present occasion of con∣tinuall bryngyng in more counterfaict Testons: therefore the kynges Maie∣stie, by the aduise of the lorde Protec∣tour, and the rest of his highnes coun∣saill, straightly chargeth and commaū∣deth, thesaied proclamacion of disanul∣lyng, and criyng doune of thesaid Te∣stons, to bee kepte emonges all his lo∣uyng subiectes, so that thesame be ne∣uer herafter taken, for currant or law∣full money, but may lawfully be refu∣sed, of any maner of persone: And yet
neuerthelesse, of his mooste Princely clemencie and liberalitie, his highnes by thaduise aforesaied, is content that al suche somes of money, as shalbe due to his Maiestie, aswell for the Relief, graunted in the last Sessions of the Parliament, as for all other Rentes and debtes, maie be paied in good and lawfull Testons, of the stamp & coyne of his maiesties father, at any time be∣fore the first of Iune nexte folowyng, and so receiued of his highnes Threa∣surers, vntil thesaid first of Iune next folowyng onely, after the rate and va∣lue of .xij. d. euery Teston. After whi∣che tyme, his highnes pleasure is, that in no wise thesaid testons, be any more receiued, of any his highnes officers of receipte, of, or for that price. Neuer∣theles, for the space and tyme of twoo Monethes after, that is to saie, vnto the ende and last daie of Iuly next fo∣lowyng, his highnes is content, that all good and lawfull Testons, at his maiesties Mintes, shalbe receiued for bullion, after the rate of .xij. d. the pece
of any persone, who shall bryng theim thether. And further, that it shalbe le∣full to any man, to buye any good and lawfull Testons, of thesaid coyne and stampe, of the late kyng, and made in a∣ny of the Mintes, within this realme of Englande, to that intent to bryng them to the Mintes, of any person not disposed to bryng them himself: so that he do buye them for no lesse price, then after .xi. d. ob. the pece, and not vnder, vpō pain that whosoeuer, for his awne gredines and lucre, shal buy any suche Testons, for lesse value then after .xi. d ob. the pece, to the domage of the poore men, who would sell thesame, shal for∣faict therefore the Testons so bought, and tenne tymes the value of theim, whereof one moytie to the kynges ma∣iestie, the other to the demaunder of the saied forfaict, by bill, accion of debt, or informaciō, in any of the kynges maie∣sties Courtes of Record, where no es∣sone, Proteccion nor wager of lawe, shal serue or be allowed. And his high∣nes further is content, that all his of∣ficers
and Ministers, maie receiue all suche good and lawfull Testons, and so repaie them again vnto his highnes after thesaied price of .xi. d. ob. the pece duryng onely thesaied Monethes, of Iune and Iuly. In the whiche tyme, for that price of .xi. d. ob. the pece, thei shall refuse no lawfull and good Te∣stons, of any his highnes subiectes. Af∣ter the whiche last daie of the monethe of Iuly nexte folowyng, his highnes expresse will and pleasure, by thaduise aforesaid, is, that the coyne called Te∣stons, of his highnes father, kyng Hē∣ry the eightes stampe, shall neither be receiued of his highnes officers, ne of none others, nor yet at the Mintes or exchaunge, as coyne or money of any valuaciō, but after suche sort as plate or any other straūge bullion is, or then shalbe, that is to saie, accordyng to the rate of the standard, and the quantitie of fine siluer in theim contained, and none otherwise.

Vpō this moste Godly warnyng, admonishemēt and Proclamaciō, whiche was to kepe order and lawes, his highnes is aduer∣tised, that a greate nomber of rude and ignoraunt people, in certain Shires of Englande, hath taken occasion, or at the least pretended to take occasion, of dooyng greate and moste perilous and heinous disorder, and contrary to all good lawes and statutes, and the order of this Realme, haue rioteously with Routes and compaignies, with force, strength and violence, of their awne hedde and aucthoritie, assembled theim selfes, plucked doune mennes hedges disparked their parkes, and beyng led by furious and light guydes of vprore, taken vpon them the direccion of thin∣ges, the kynges royall power & sworde

is contented and pleased, to remit and pardon, all thesaied outragies, misbe∣hauours, riottes and conspiracies, to all and singuler his Subiectes, other then to suche, as be already apprehen∣ded and in prisō, as heddes and stirrers of thesaied outrage and riottes, and therefore, willeth and commaundeth, al Iustices of peace, Maiors, shirifes, bailifes, and al other his highnes offi∣cers and ministers, not to enterrupt, vexe or trouble, for, and in his Maie∣sties behalfe, any maner persone, other then is specified before, of, or for any offence, iniury, contempt or conspiracy doen at thesaied stirre or riottes, late∣ly made, aboute the breakyng of enclo∣sures, so that thei do not attempt or go aboute, any suche thyng hereafter: but if so be there be any iust cause, to com∣plain for default of Iustice, or lacke of redresse in any suche inclosure or de∣fault, made against thesaied Actes and Statutes, before specified in this case prouided, thei, who finde theimself iu∣stly greued or iniuried, maie geue in∣formacion,

The second daie of Iuly. A Proclamacion, for the prices of Victualles. THe kynges Maiestie, hauyng the principall and continuall charge of the commō welth & trāquilitie of this realme, for

to prouide remedy herein, the whiche (restyng vpon the former re∣dresse of sondery disorders, in the whole common welth) although it cānot be so absolutly & spedely had as his maiesties moste hartie desire is, yet it is thought by his Maiestie, for the present disor∣ders, a greate relief to put in due exe∣cucion, diuerse good lawes and statu∣tes, prouided heretofore, by aucthoritie of Parliament, in the reignes of the kynges maiesties moste noble progeni∣tors, and especially twoo pollitique good estatutes, made at Westminster in the .xxv. yere of the reigne of his ma∣iesties moste dere father late deceassed, kyng Henry the eight, ordeined, as by thesame appereth, very pollitiquely, for the redresse of these like disorders of prices, whiche at any time thence after might happen: theffect of whiche later estatute is, that the lorde Threasorer, the Lorde Chauncellor of Englande, the Lorde President of the Kynges moste honorable Counsaill, the Lorde Priuey Seale, the Lorde Stewarde,

And it was further enacted, by the∣said

And it was further prouided, by the said act, that thesame act or any thyng therein conteined, should not be hurt∣full to Maiors, Shirifes, Bailifes, & other officers of Cities, Boroughes, and Tounes corporate, nor to ony per∣sone or persones, or bodies pollitique, hauyng aucthoritie, to sette prices of suche victualles, or of any of them, but that thei and euery of theim, might set prices therof, as if thesame act had ne∣uer been had nor made, as by thesame acte, emonges other thynges, more at
